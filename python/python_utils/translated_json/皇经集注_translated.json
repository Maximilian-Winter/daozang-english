  "full_translation": "**The Collected Commentaries on the Original Acts of the Supreme Jade Emperor**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Collected Commentaries on the Original Acts of the Supreme Jade Emperor* (Abbreviated as *Collected Commentaries on the Jade Emperor Scripture*).\n\nCompiled by Zhou Xuanzhen, a Daoist of the Quanzhen tradition during the Ming dynasty. This work gathers commentaries on the *Jade Emperor Scripture* from the Song, Jin, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, with an appended commentary on the *Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal Scripture*. Ten fascicles in total.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.\n\n---\n\n**Fascicle One of the Commentaries on the Jade Emperor Scripture**\n\n**Preface to the Collected Commentaries on the Jade Emperor Scripture**\n\nComposed by the Heavenly Marshal of Harmonious Response, the Heavenly Worthy of Concordant Virtue\n\nThe Great Dao is formless, yet it subtly initiates the myriad things;\nThe Perfect Truth is imageless, yet it gathers the hearts of all to return of their own accord.\nIts mechanism is like a great bell—struck, it responds at once.\nHow vast is the Supreme Sage! Sincerity alone suffices to commune with it.\n\nWe reverently regard the *Original Acts Scripture* as the secret words of the Mysterious Emperor, the pivotal essence of the boundless heavens.\nIn the Floating Black True Realm, it records the first transmission of the Dao;\nIn the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, it reveals the traces of its sealed mysteries.\nTruly, it is the hidden melody of all heavens, the immortal verses of the Great Brahmā.\nWhen the Eight Trigrams faced ruin, it was due to the imperial brush;\nWhen the thousand perfected stood in guard, it universally delivered the numinous spirits of humanity.\nWho can fathom its kalpas? Who can know its ages?\nFor the multitudes of the great earth, deluded and lost, have forsaken their true nature, destroyed their original forms, and indulged in sensual desires, unable to cleanse themselves—thus the sacred text remained hidden.\n\nToday, as jade emerges from Kun Mountain and pearls divide from the vast sea, we have obtained this luminous scripture, prostrating in awe and wonder.\nIt is said: those imprisoned in darkness, yearning for its wondrous meaning, may be redeemed at the source;\nThose afflicted with chronic illness, gazing upon its virtuous resonance, may be instantly cured.\nIt is a torch in the gloom, a vessel upon the abyss—preserving the state, pacifying the household, aiding the living, and delivering the dead.\nInscribed on golden tablets and jade scrolls, its vastness is beyond measure.\nWithout reverence for the true wind, how can one grasp this principle?\nI humbly set forth its essentials to enlighten those yet unenlightened.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Collected Scripture on the Original Acts of the Supreme Jade Emperor**\n\nThe Dao is fundamentally wordless, yet all scriptures are the traces of true sages’ discourse. Words reveal the Dao, and even sages and worthies do not abandon them.\nSince the division of the Three Powers and the establishment of the teachings of names, principle has remained unified—yet the deluded may diverge from it, and divergence is not the Way.\n\nBefore the kalpas began, the Primordial Beginning sat in illumination. When the time and destiny were ripe, the perfected ones inquired of the Jade Emperor regarding his causal acts, and thus he expounded this scripture.\nIt is the most venerable of dharma categories, the foremost of numinous texts—no scripture since has equaled it.\nIts true words are profound and recondite, eschewing ornate embellishment. Though its Brahmā-verse is self-contained, its purport is inexhaustible; even the sages cannot speak of it, nor can thought or contemplation reach it. Yet this scripture encompasses all, as clear as the palm of one’s hand.\n\nYour servant, Zhang Zhong, served in the civil administration of the Zhou dynasty, entrusted with affairs by the Supreme Emperor. Upon hearing this scripture, he vowed to treasure and uphold it to the end.\nWhen the Emperor reviewed the merits and transgressions of humanity, he recorded that your servant Zhong walked the path of loyalty and filial piety, and commanded him to oversee the transformation of the Nine Heavens and compile this scripture.\nWithin its profound mysteries, he savored its richness to the fullest.\n\nAlas! Those who study this scripture in the world fail to embody the sagely intent, to grasp the profound essence. Erroneous carvings and misguided transmissions have led to distortions in its verses, splitting it into two names—*Cavernous Mystery* and *Supreme*—each clinging to private interpretations in transmission, greatly deviating from the intent of the scripture’s exposition. Some even adhere rigidly like tuning pegs to a zither.\nThe reckless and absurd may disbelieve this scripture, or claim it borrows from other texts, or force interpretations in ignorance—all unaware of the scripture’s supremacy, and that the retributions of blessings and misfortunes cannot be escaped. How grievous is their error!\n\nYour servant Zhong could not bear the loss of this magnificent canon, nor the folly of the vulgar world, which, in ignorance, offends without hearing the Great Dao.\nHe memorialized the Emperor’s command, enlisting immortal perfected ones to explicate the scripture’s meaning, disseminating it among the mortal realm as the key to exhaustive study and the ladder to the human Dao.\nMay this sacred canon serve as a vessel, rescuing those long drowned;\nMay this wondrous medicine of the Mysterious Tradition readily cure chronic ailments.\nThose who hear the scripture and awaken to the Dao shall never speak recklessly;\nThose who respond to the moment and recognize the true shall forever escape the wheel of rebirth.\nAcross the three thousand great thousand worlds, every realm shall become a domain of supreme harmony;\nFrom kalpa to kalpa, every generation shall be a scene of joy and benefit.\nThose who seek the Dao shall surely attain it; no wish shall go unfulfilled.\nThe merit of this scripture shall thus be without fail.\n\nI respectfully inscribe this preface.\n\n**Zhang Zhong, Minister of the Nine Heavens’ Civilizing Transformation and the Venerable Emperor of Literary Florescence, prostrates and bows a hundred times.**\n\n---\n\n**On the Original Dao**\n\nComposed by the Venerable Immortal of the Southern Culmen, the Aged Recluse\n\nThe Venerable Immortal of the Southern Culmen says: Tracing the origins of Daoist teachings, we find that in the primordial chaos before separation, the human Dao was not yet complete. Heaven commanded our Dao Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor of Xuanyuan, to inherit the mandate of the Nine August Ones, to grasp the reins of the Six Dragons and ascend the heavens, to establish the celestial pole on behalf of Heaven, and to stabilize the Three Powers.\n\nAt that time, Heaven and Earth had not yet become distinct; there were no written characters, so knotted cords served in place of governance. There were no houses, so people dwelt in nests and caves. There were no garments, so they bound grasses to cover their bodies. There were no utensils, so they drank from cupped hands and hollowed vessels. Our Dao Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor of Xuanyuan, first created written characters, fashioned clothing, built palaces, and crafted utensils, thereby completing human affairs.\n\nAmong the Nine Schools and within the Three Teachings, the written characters in use, the clothing worn, the houses inhabited, and the vessels employed all originated with the Yellow Emperor—all derived from the teachings of our Daoist school and the Yellow Emperor. Moreover, Laozi said that what gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the myriad things must itself have a source, which he did not know by name, so he provisionally called it the *Dao* and provisionally wrote it as *Great*, hence the *Great Dao*. Its teaching is called *Daoism*, and from this the world first acquired the term *Dao*.\n\nThus, all who speak of cultivating the Dao or studying the Dao are borrowing Laozi’s words and using *Dao* as their name. Are they not disciples of Laozi? Furthermore, Laozi’s phrase “mysterious and yet more mysterious, the gateway to all wonders” has also been borrowed and used in scriptures—all employing Laozi’s words. Likewise, the *Book of Zhuangzi* states: “Only after the Great Awakening does one know the sage.” These two characters, *Great Awakening*, were coined by Zhuangzi; Emperor Huizong of Song later adopted them to honor the Golden Immortal. All such terms in the scriptures derive from the writings of our Daoist school, from the teachings of the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, and Zhuangzi.\n\nIn the preface to the *Commentary on the August Scripture*, it is said: The character *Dao* is revered equally by the Three Teachings. Yet reckless and deluded fools regard the Dao as a lesser vehicle, showing their ignorance. The Jade Emperor is honored by all Three Teachings. Some blind followers call him the Heavenly Lord and criticize this as insufficiently reverent, failing to understand the root and origin of the Jade Emperor’s conduct. The Emperor’s virtue is boundless; his merits, once accomplished, are indestructible. His position is most exalted, his name most supreme; he governs the myriad heavens and encompasses the Three Teachings. Across the three thousand great thousand worlds, he moves through kalpas with effortless mastery. Confucians call him the Supreme Emperor; Buddhists name him Dipamkara; Daoists title him the Mysterious Lord—his dignity is peerless.\n\nWhoever reads this scripture will understand the Emperor’s wondrous deeds and resolve millennia of doubts and myriad confusions. Yet those who remain ignorant, who do not grasp the scriptural text, continue to speak recklessly, failing to awaken and thereby deepening their transgressions. How can they recognize that human life originates from the Dao, is governed by the Supreme Emperor, and is enlightened by the sagely teachings? To slight the Emperor is to disrespect Heaven; to slander the scripture is to fail to comprehend the Great Dao—this is to turn one’s back on one’s roots and forget one’s origins, to misunderstand the source of life and creation.\n\nI, Yan, have long lamented this and thus place this preface at the beginning of the commentary as a warning.\n\n**Minister Lü Yan, the Pure Yang Admonishing and Transforming Protector Emperor, prostrates and bows a hundred times in reverence.**\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Second Continuation of the *Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture***\n\nThe existence of scriptures for the Dao is like the sun and moon in the sky or the statutes and canons of a nation. Gazing upon the sun and moon prevents the folly of facing a wall; following the laws of former kings ensures no transgressions. Thus, venerating and believing in the true scriptures is surely the standard for entering the Dao.\n\nMoreover, this scripture was personally transmitted by the Primordial Beginning, proclaimed by the Jade Emperor and the various deities—it is the highest rank among the Three Teachings, the secret words of the Great Sage, worthy of reverence in every place and esteemed in every kalpa. Yet the Dao is wordless; this scripture has already given it form through language. Why then is a commentary needed? The scripture, expressed in written words, is understood only by those who have attained the Dao. For those who have not yet entered the gate, it is deeply dependent upon this.\n\nOtherwise, crossing a river without a raft—how can one reach the shore? Alas! To abandon the scripture in seeking the Dao is wrong; to cling to the scripture as the Dao is also wrong.\n\nTo contemplate the scripture with the heart, to verify the heart through the scripture—when heart and spirit merge in understanding, this Heavenly Treasure Divine Chapter is inherently within our nature. With true illumination, one does not cling to the written word, so how could the two errors arise?\n\nLong Spring, Assistant to Transformation and Illuminated Responder, Perfected Lord Qiu Chujī, bows his head a hundred times in reverence.\n\n**Preface to the First Four Chapters of the *Imperial Scripture Collected Commentaries***\n\nThe greatness of the Dao and the majesty of the Jade Emperor—the sacred profundity of the *Imperial Scripture*—your servant Zhen has long known. Yet the world, in its ignorance, raises reckless arguments, as if the Dao could be abandoned, Heaven profaned, and the sacred scripture treated lightly. How could this be so? Just as the Dao has its scripture, so the nature has this body; just as Heaven has its Emperor, so the body has its Heavenly Lord. Without the illusory body, the nature would have nothing to adhere to, and its wonders would not manifest; without the Heavenly Lord, the body would have no master, and its form would be empty. If body and heart cannot be without these, then how can one fail to repay the Emperor’s grace or believe in the scripture’s merit?\n\nYet belief in the scripture is not merely about the written word—it is through the heart’s spiritual communion. If one truly attains and does not forget, the wondrous fruit is achieved.\n\nMinister Deng, Heavenly Lord and Marshal of Thunder, bows his head a hundred times in reverence to compose this preface.\n\n**Three Praises**\n\nYour servant, Heavenly Lord Deng, bows his head and speaks:\n\n**Three Praises**\n\n**Praise**\nVast is the Supreme Dao, without peer among the highest perfected.\n**Dao**\nTranscendent across the Three Teachings, this alone is revered.\n\n**Praise**\nAugust is the Jade Emperor, unmatched among the Three Teachings.\n**Emperor**\nThrough kalpas vast as desert sands, ever does one return to the Most Honored.\n\n**Praise**\nAugust is the sacred canon, subtle and profoundly deep.\n**Canon**\nEncompassing the Three Teachings, its dharma-treasures stand supreme.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the First Compilation of the *August Canon* with Collected Annotations**\n\nThe Sage of Propagation did not speak of the numinous, yet revered the service of the Supreme Emperor; Confucians shunned discourse on the mysterious, yet earnestly upheld the learning of the heart. The Supreme Emperor was indeed never treated lightly by the Confucians, yet none observed the Daoist scriptures, grasped the profound intent, or fused the Three into One. Was this due to sectarian exclusivity? Or was the practice of the Dao too pressing to allow for it? Alas, how narrow!\n\nThe matter does not lie in clinging to names; the Dao values only true benefit. If the profound scriptures were not so, how could they speak of the Dao? If they are so, how do they differ from the Confucians—why then should one be so rigidly bound?\n\nYour servant Hongxian, from youth, studied the teachings of Confucius and once delved into the profound canon, glimpsing as if an attainment, though dared not presume it certain. Later, passing the imperial examinations and dwelling at Golden Phoenix Slope, I was able to peruse the books of the Three Teachings and came to know that none is more revered than the Dao, none deeper than the profound. Among the Three Teachings, no text surpasses the *August Canon*—as indispensable as beans, grain, cloth, and silk. Its profound meanings are difficult to fathom; the commentaries of the immortals must not go untransmitted. Thus, I took refuge beyond the worldly realm and piously compiled this volume. Yet my frail body daily weakened, and I had not the means to publish it. Later, I encountered a recluse from Jinan in Shandong, Zhou Yunqing, who lectured on the profound canon and edited the *Daoist Canon*. I entrusted my humble words to my friend, the Unskillful Daoist, to pass on to him.\n\nIn the winter of the thirteenth year of the Wanli reign, the former *zhuangyuan* Fang Yichen of Jiangxi, Luo Hongxian, bows in reverence to compose this preface.\n\n**Preface to the Compilation of the *August Canon* with Collected Annotations**\n\nThe difficulty of speaking of the Dao has long been so.\n\nYour humble servant, Xuan Zhen—a dull-witted rustic of the wilds, unworthy to speak of the Dao—how could I presume to compile the *Daoist Canon* and assemble the *Collected Annotations to the August Canon*? It is like an ant attempting to bear a mountain, revealing only my incapacity. Yet the Great Dao does not reject the lowly, and even humble study may yield understanding. Though the Jade Canon is profound, the immortals have elucidated its mysteries. When the late Grand Historian Luo entrusted this work to me, to omit it from the Canon would be to conceal a celestial treasure; to include it, however, left me uneasy. I feared my shallow insights might fail to harmonize with the immortals’ intent, forcing me to regurgitate half-digested interpretations that would provoke revulsion, distorting the sublime flavor of the Dao and compounding my offense.\n\nAlas! True clarity in exposition is rare in this world. For this dull and unworthy servant to undertake such a task is to invite failure and guilt. Yet my resolve lies in practicing the Dao, and even Confucius did not shun criticism for such a cause. Who am I to evade blame and abandon this completed work? If those of noble spirit and deep understanding, upon reviewing my humble efforts, take pity and further illuminate the text to expound its meaning, then this compilation will not have been in vain.\n\nRespectfully inscribed.\nIn the fifteenth year of the Wanli reign, your devoted servant Zhou Xuan Zhen of Shandong, compiler of the *Daoist Canon*, bows in reverence.\n\n**Preface to the Transcription of the *Collected Annotations to the August Canon***\n\nTo practice the Dao and propagate one’s name is to honor one’s forebears. This is what the world calls “loyalty perfecting filial piety”—a principle upheld through the ages. Your servant Jingcui, having studied the Confucian classics in youth, knew of the Heavenly Emperor’s majesty but not that the practice of the Dao transcends worldly achievement—this I only later came to understand. After following my Daoist master, Zhou Yunqing, in compiling the *Daoist Canon* and attending to its transcription, I studied the *Annotations to the August Canon* and realized that the Three Teachings share a single principle, and the nature of the Dao is undivided. This canon directly points to the profound essentials; to awaken to it is to exhaust the Dao. Thus, I have presumptuously placed this preface at the head of the volume as self-admonition.\n\nIn the summer of the sixteenth year of the Wanli reign, your devoted servant Wang Jingcui, a Daoist practitioner in the capital, bows in reverence to inscribe this.\n\n**Examination of Key Principles**\n**Investigation of the Origins of the Dao**\n\n**Investigation of the Origins of the Dao**\n\nThe Dao in its essence is formless and nameless—who could fathom its source, or from what would one begin to examine it? Yet since the Primordial Beginning divided and transformed, the Great Void conceived wondrous existence, and the Dao’s mysteries became manifest, names were thereby established. The True One embraces the Three, and the Three Teachings stand therein. Being and non-being, end and beginning—none lie beyond the Five Phases. Aeon after aeon they give rise to one another; sage after sage they transmit the lineage—all is the Dao. Even those who leap beyond the Three Realms and stand apart from the Five Phases cannot escape being counted among those who attain the Dao. Thus, the Dao’s revelation is the very origin of the term \"Daoist school.\" Therefore, we first examine this in our search for the origins of the scriptures.\n\n**Investigation of the Origins of the Scriptures**\n\nScriptures serve to convey the Dao, acting as the compassionate vessel for delivering the world. All scriptures are the sacred teachings of perfected beings, containing nothing but the supreme principle. Yet this scripture unfolds from the Primordial Beginning and takes its transformative source from the Jade Emperor. The Primordial Beginning is the foremost of the Three Teachings; the Jade Emperor is the origin of the myriad dharmas. This scripture is of the utmost mystery and wonder, uniquely crowning the Three Teachings; it is also the sovereign of all scriptures, enduring through infinite kalpas. Its revelation extends from the beginningless past, concealed in the Dark Heavens and treasured within the Jade Summit. Its characters are no ordinary script—each spans a full *zhang*, their radiance boundless. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, responding to the times, took up his brush and transcribed it for transmission to the world. Such is the origin of this scripture’s promulgation. Thus, we continue our investigation by tracing the lineage of the Dao’s transmission.\n\n**Investigation of the Lineage and Manifestations of the Jade Emperor, Supreme Master of the Myriad Dharmas and Sacred Ancestor of the Mysterious Teachings**\n\nMasters deliver the world, shattering delusion and rescuing beings from suffering. They transmit the Dao and bestow scriptures, opening the future and continuing the past. The Great Dao’s Mysterious Master unifies the Three Teachings, encompasses the myriad dharmas, dwells in the Heaven within Heaven, and stands as the Sage among Sages—without beginning or end, his origin transcends all inquiry, existing before the ten thousand forms. Yet the Dao’s wondrous manifestations divide into truth: he appears in the Radiant and Majestic Land of Joy, a manifestation from a past kalpa. The world observes the luminous yang of the celestial Dao—yang governs bestowal, its mechanism ever active—hence they honor the Emperor as the Great Emperor Zhang. The deluded, failing to grasp this principle, mistakenly claim that the Zhang clan of Xingtang in the former Northern Zhili (now Hebei) are descendants of the Jade Emperor. How could they know that the Xingtang Zhang clan are merely descendants of Zhang Guo and successors of Zhang the Immortal? How could these be conflated in discussion? This is but an investigation of surnames and worldly lineages.\n\nIf we discuss lineage, the Jade Emperor is the foremost emanation of the Great Dao, the primordial ancestor of kalpas vast—how could he have birth, death, or a mortal name? The Jade Emperor’s sacred consort, divine children, and retinue were all palace attendants from his time as Radiant and Majestic Crown Prince. When the Emperor ascended, his entire court attained the Dao. Essentially, the Empress and her attendants were not truly female in form; all were celestial perfected beings. To deliver the multitude of beings, they manifested as female bodies—this has already been explained. It is like the Buddha attaining the Way while his wife and children achieved sagehood. Regard the Jade Emperor as the progenitor of the Dao: the myriad beings of countless kalpas, all life born of heaven and earth, are but offshoots of the Dao’s lineage. Who among them is not part of the Jade Emperor’s retinue and system? Once the attendants of the Great Brahma Palace attain the Dao, they become celestial perfected beings. For example, Mañjuśrī presides over the Immaculate World, and the Dragon Girl attained the Way and transformed into a male body—this principle is the same. Yet today’s monks, Daoists, and laypeople, failing to grasp this truth, mistakenly believe the Jade Emperor has a mortal court, undergoes rebirth, and attains only the Two Vehicles’ fruition. How could they know that while the heavens may perish, the Three Clarities’ realm and the Great Brahma Heaven are imperishable? While the gods of the heavens undergo rebirth, the Jade Emperor does not. For the Jade Emperor is the embodiment of the Dao, and the Dao is boundless—how could the Jade Emperor be finite? Truly, he is the supreme teacher of all Buddhas of the One Vehicle, the King of the Myriad Heavens, and his court is but the wondrous transformation of the Dao. Such is the outline of the profound lineage. Scholars must not speak carelessly; let them examine this investigation in detail.\n\n**Record of the Merits of Engraving Scriptures**\nIn the most ancient times, scriptures had no paper or brushes; they were recorded on bamboo and wooden slips. When Meng Tian and Cai Lun invented paper and brushes, scriptures were transcribed thereafter. Later, lofty scholars engraved printing blocks to reproduce them, doubling the merit. Yet deluded followers of heterodox paths, unaware that Meng and Cai received blessings in Tuṣita Heaven, claim these two men suffered karmic retribution in hell. In truth, the two descended into the underworld under the guidance of the Most High Lord of Salvation from Suffering and the Underworld Lord Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva, bearing scriptures to deliver those condemned for heretical teachings. How could they have endured hell’s torments? Their merit was immense, for they advanced the propagation of scriptures and teachings.\n\n**Record of the True Benefits of Recitation, Dissemination, and Exegesis**\nRecitation and exegesis require utmost sincerity, free from defilement, attachment, or delusion—such merit accords with the scriptures’ words. Printing and distributing scriptures yield even greater merit, for they widely disseminate the Dharma’s treasures. To treat scriptures lightly, slander them, or defile them incurs grave transgressions. Be diligent, be warned, and do not betray the teachings of sages and worthies.\n\n**Investigation of the Jade Emperor’s Sacred Titles and Their Variations**\nThe Jade Emperor’s sacred titles have been revered since before the kalpas vast; in the middle ancient era, they were further exalted and repeatedly praised. As worldly rulers embraced the Dao and received the mysterious grace, each honored what they witnessed and revered. Matters aligned with the times, and merits manifested in the world. As their manifestations became evident, all people saw and heard, venerating the titles of the various deities to establish proper appellations. There are four Jade Emperors: the first is the Great Tenuous Jade Emperor, the title bestowed by Emperor Wu of Han upon the ruler of the Great Tenuous Enclosure; the second is the Brahma Heaven Jade Emperor, the title bestowed by Emperor Xuan of Han upon the ruler of the Heavenly Market Enclosure; the third is the Fiery Splendor Lesser Tenuous Jade Emperor, the title bestowed by Emperor Ai of Han upon the precelestial fixed position; the fourth is the Purple Ultimate Jade Emperor, the title bestowed by Emperor Guangwu of Han upon the postcelestial Qian trigram. None of these are this Jade Emperor. This Jade Emperor’s titles are Supreme Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Vast Heaven, the Most Honored, the Spontaneously Wondrous Existent, the Perfected of Miraculous Radiance, the Jade Sovereign Lord of Heaven, also called the Most High August Jade Emperor of the Mysterious Firmament. He governs all heavens, eternally indestructible and imperishable. Yet the world, failing to investigate thoroughly, erroneously equates him with Śakra, unaware that the Jade Emperor’s titles differ entirely. The four Jade Emperors are all under the dominion of the Most High Jade Emperor. Those who speak of the Four Heavenly Emperors as equals of this Jade Emperor are also mistaken. Those who comprehend heaven will understand this.\n\n**Investigation of the Jade Emperor’s Governance and Supreme Authority**\nMaster Ge Xian said: The heavens of the world appear the same to all. Confucians speak of one heaven and earth, one Lord on High. Daoists speak of thirty billion myriad great Dharma realms, each with thirty-six heavens, each heaven with its own emperor—all under the dominion of the Most High Jade Emperor. Buddhists speak of three thousand great thousand-worlds, each with thirty-two heavens, each heaven with its own Jade Emperor. The three teachings’ discourses seem divergent. Yet when they speak of one heaven, they refer to the Great Void beyond, acknowledging its boundlessness, hence the thirty billion myriad. Beyond this, they also speak of the inconceivable. When they speak of three thousand great thousand-worlds, beyond this, they also speak of the immeasurable. Thus, Confucians speak of following the Lord’s decree and say the sage emulates heaven. Heaven’s essence is boundless; even through kalpas, epochs, and generations, this principle holds. Therefore, the Lord on High is unchanging. Daoists speak of the Most High’s formless void, the true Emperor as indestructible; Buddhists speak of true suchness and self-mastery, eternally unretrogressive. All affirm that the Jade Emperor is imperishable. Thus, to speak of one heaven is not to neglect the vast; it is to name the whole, which is nondual with the profound and the Buddhist. To speak of thirty billion myriad or three thousand great thousand-worlds is not a falsehood; it is to enumerate parts, which aligns with the Confucians. As for the Buddhist claim that each heaven has its own Jade Emperor, each realm has its own ultimate. The Daoist claim that all realms share this Jade Emperor means all realms are one and infinite. Whether called the Great Void, the inconceivable, or the immeasurable, all know the Dao is unchanging and the Jade Emperor eternally present. If one divides worlds and claims the Jade Emperors differ, does this mean the principle of infinity is dual? If one asserts that with the passage of kalpas the Lord on High perishes, does this mean the principle of infinity is destructible? Knowing the Dao is indestructible, the Jade Emperor is eternally present. This is certain; do not cling to demonic doctrines to slander the sacred.\n\n**Investigation of the Jade Emperor’s Pure Tenuous Heavenly Realm**\nWang Chongyang said: The Pure Tenuous is the most profound and subtle realm of heaven, what Daoists call the Heaven of the Seeded People, Confucians call the Beyond of the Vast and Formless, the ever-indestructible azure expanse, and Buddhists call the unretrogressive realm.\n\nWithin the miscellaneous writings of Chan Buddhism, erroneous claims place the Jade Emperor atop Mount Sumeru, identifying Him with the Heaven of the Sun and Moon or the Heaven of the Four Kings—realms subject to destruction—while asserting that only Maitreya’s Inner Court remains an unretrogressive domain. Some further speak of the \"Milo Enclosure\" or \"Mila Garden,\" three variant names derived from the Daoist scriptures’ Supreme Primordial Lord, referring to the same transcendent realm: the Pure Tenuous Heaven of the Jade Emperor’s abode in the Mysterious True Realm of Milo. The Heaven of the Sun and Moon and the Heaven of the Four Kings, however, are but the dwelling of the Supreme Tenuous Jade Emperor, not that of the Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Jade Emperor. Thus, the Daoist scriptures state: \"Atop the Mysterious Valley Mountain resides the Imperial Lord, who pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Jade Emperor.\" The Mysterious Valley Mountain is none other than the Chan Buddhist Mount Sumeru, where the Lord of the Sun and Moon governs as the deity presiding over this heaven—akin to the present-day Prefect of the Imperial Capital. Hence, the Buddhist sutras describe the scene of the Tathāgata expounding the Dharma while Śakra, Lord of the Devas, holds an umbrella overhead, much like a newly minted *zhuangyuan* ascending the golden hall, where the Ministry of Rites raises a toast, and the Prefect of the Capital unfurls an umbrella to signify the court’s honor for the worthy. Yet heretical currents have mistaken Śakra, who merely holds the umbrella, for the Most High Jade Emperor, as if equating the Prefect of the Capital with the Emperor himself. Such errors are egregious, and distortions of this kind abound.\n\nWithin these miscellaneous writings, it is further claimed that Mount Kunlun has eight distinct locations. Though the eight directions may be spoken of, they ultimately converge in the northwest—the Qian trigram’s head, the Kunlun of the northwest. What the Confucians call the \"Pillar of Heaven and the Web of Earth\" is none other than the Daoist Mysterious Valley Mountain and the Buddhist Mount Sumeru. How could there be eight such mountains? Yet the world has long perpetuated this misconception, and thus, in examining the Pure Tenuous Heavenly Realm, these errors are addressed to caution those who propagate such fallacies.\n\n**Investigation of the Jade Emperor’s Rank of Honor**\nLiu Haichan said: Within Daoism, the Jade Emperor is the transformation of the Three Pure Ones. The Daoist tradition first speaks of the Three Pure Ones as preceding the Void and Nothingness before the Wondrous Existence, referring to the Wuji and Taiji—realms without distinction of honor or inferiority. In Buddhism, He is Dipamkara Buddha, manifesting as the body of Śākyamuni Buddha. Chan Buddhists prioritize the Buddha over the Jade Emperor, reflecting the foreign custom of revering their own sovereign before the Emperor of China. Yet when examining the Dao’s hierarchy of honor, *The Golden Wheel Sutra* states: \"The Jade Dipper’s Mysterious Mandate rides forth, as the spirit soars to the Supreme Ultimate. The Five Planets lead as envoys, while Śakra and Brahmā serve as attendants.\" Śakra and Brahmā here represent the immortals, Buddhas, and bodhisattvas. The Emperor’s trust in the Three Pure Ones and the Buddha is but a manifestation to guide sentient beings toward the Dao. Yet worldly currents, failing to trace the source, arbitrarily assign ranks, demoting the Jade Emperor to a secondary honor—as if there were beings in the world greater than the Emperor. Some even compare the Three Pure Ones and the Buddha to retired emperors, distorting the sequence of the Jade Emperor’s prior and subsequent manifestations. To liken those of different surnames and titles to father and son is an even graver transgression.\n\nAlas! Just as the world cannot exist without the Jade Emperor, so too must all life have ancestors and parents. To slander the Supreme Emperor and establish rival sects is to abandon one’s ancestors and parents in pursuit of self-exaltation. How can this be permitted?\n\n**Investigation of the Jade Emperor’s Beneficent Titles**\nLan Caihe said: People know to revere the Supreme Emperor but do not invoke His sacred titles. Some Confucians claim that reciting them is improper, unaware that Mencius spoke of \"the great filial son who cherishes his parents all his life.\" To cherish one’s parents with a sincere heart is to be a filial child; to invoke the Emperor’s titles with a sincere heart, ensuring no transgressions, is this not to be a true child of Heaven and Earth? To embody the form perfectly is to align with Heaven and Earth, and the benefits shall be boundless.\n\n**Investigation of the Benefits of the *August Emperor’s Scripture***\nZhang Ziyang said: Where there is the rise of an emperor, there must be the establishment of imperial institutions. Those who adhere to these institutions do not err. How much more so with the *August Emperor’s Scripture*, the heart-seal of the Dao’s essential teaching? To embody it is to become a sage—how could it merely prevent transgressions? Yet people today doubt its benefits, for they have not sincerely practiced its recitation and upholding. Let the wise reflect on this.\n\n**Investigation of the Merits and Transgressions in Collating the Emperor’s Scripture**\nZhongli Zi said: All beings arise from the Dao, their true nature derived from the Heavenly Emperor. Thus, virtue moves Heaven, and blessings naturally follow. Even in poverty and lowliness, one’s peace and joy surpass others—this is the true Hall of Blessings. Evil, however, is self-inflicted calamity, as Heaven sends down misfortune. Even in wealth and nobility, one’s misfortune and woe become a living hell. Fortune and misfortune are fixed, following one’s goodness or evil; the resonance between Heaven and humanity is swifter than an echo. Yet deluded beings do not believe, and thus the merit-recorded adage states: \"To truly recite one volume of the *August Emperor’s Scripture* is to accumulate a thousand virtues, ascending to the Heavenly Hall.\" True recitation unifies inner and outer, aligning speech and conduct with the Dao—not merely chanting the scripture with the mouth, but embodying goodness in every thought. How excellent!\n\nWang Lingguan said: \"Why trouble skilled hands to depict my image? I only wish your heart aligns with mine.\" To align one’s heart with the Supreme Emperor is to cultivate virtue and blessings in tandem—this is true recitation and meritorious goodness. All else—reciting scriptures, restraining speech, and disciplining the mind; venerating the prescribed years and months—though blessed, yields results commensurate with the magnitude of one’s goodness, and thus ranks secondary.\n\nThe transgression-recorded adage states: \"To disbelieve this scripture is to fall into heretical paths, for a heart misaligned with the Dao becomes a heretic.\" It further warns: \"To slander the true scripture is to descend into hell.\" Disbelief merely limits one’s awareness of the scripture’s merits, a minor transgression. Slander, however, abolishes Heaven’s sacred text. The mind commits grave deeds, inviting boundless misfortune and sinking into the darkness of yin, where the sins are inescapable, leading straight to hell’s path. It further states: \"To revile the Emperor and slander the sages, to abolish the abodes of the gods and rend the true scriptures—such unrepentant wickedness incurs eternal karmic bonds, and the calamity extends to seven generations.\" Slander is to malign the sacred text with the mouth, defying Heaven’s majesty, and thus the sin rests upon oneself. To revile the Emperor and rend the scriptures is to persist in evil without remorse, embodying unvirtuousness and leaving an eternal stench. It dishonors the body and shames one’s kin, such that even a hundred generations of filial sons and compassionate descendants cannot undo it.\n\nThe sins of one’s own person—when shall they ever end? The transgressions of ancestors and kin—how could they ever be absolved? If not so, then when a state enacts laws to punish the guilty, why are there cases of exterminating three clans or eradicating nine lineages? It is because the crime is so grave that it extends to one’s kin. Thus, though the net of law may stretch wide, there are still those who cast perverse glances upon the scriptures, recite them without reverence, chant them with errors and disdain, or recklessly interpret and judge them, favoring one while disparaging another. According to the severity of their transgressions, there are corresponding retributions awaiting them.\n\nAlas! The Emperor’s scriptures are the law of the present age. To defy the royal law is clearly stipulated in the statutes; to disregard the sacred canon—how could there be no heavenly decrees? How lamentable that the human form is so hard to attain, the supreme Dao so hard to encounter! Parents give birth to us, their toil and suffering the same. Those of virtue bring blessings to their ancestors, just as in this world, passing the imperial examinations and receiving noble titles honors one’s kin. Those of transgression bring calamity to their ancestors, just as in this world, when descendants commit crimes, the household head is held accountable. Though human forms are the same, good and evil differ; though parental kindness is the same, blessings and karma diverge. Why then do people not do good but willingly commit evil, needlessly burdening their ancestors and clans?\n\nThe scriptures’ system of merits and demerits states this clearly: the true scriptures reside in the human heart. When one is purely good, the scriptures’ power naturally manifests. The supremely wise act in accordance with the scriptures without reciting them aloud. Those of middling wisdom perceive the Dao through the scriptures, while the utterly foolish refuse to believe even when told. The supremely wise are rare, and the utterly foolish are not many; the majority are of middling capacity, so the work of teaching and transformation must not be neglected. How can those who study these scriptures fail to embody the Jade Emperor’s compassionate intent to deliver the world, treating them as mere common texts?\n\n*An Examination of the Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture*\nMaster Shi Xinglin says: The *August Scripture* speaks the truth of the Dao, which is inherently present in our nature and thus requires no explanation. Yet people’s capacities vary, and partial views abound. Even the explanations of the immortals cannot fully convey its profound essence; they merely serve as a reference for later generations to reconcile differing interpretations.\n\n*An Examination of the Similarities and Differences in the August Scripture*\nZhang Zifang says: Originally, this scripture had no alternate names or distinctions such as *Highest Numinous Treasure*. Later generations, through arbitrary judgments, added or removed words and phrases, forcing connections in the text and severely distorting its original meaning. Now, upon examination, *Highest Numinous Treasure* derives from the praises of various perfected immortals, but later people mistakenly took it as a separate title. Here, following the definitive judgment of the Mystic Capital, we record and transmit it to the world. Later scholars should bear this in mind, silently embodying its truth. If they encounter errors in transcription, transmission, or exposition, they should collectively verify and correct them. Any extraneous additions to the text or characters are all erroneous. Those of understanding should not cling rigidly to them.\n\n*Preface to the Collected Commentaries and Transmission of the August Scripture*\nYour disciple Zhou Xuanzhen, a humble cultivator of the Dao and successor of the Complete Perfection lineage from Xiaozhao in Shandong, prostrates with utmost reverence, bowing a hundred times in purification, and respectfully submits:\n\nThe Dao is wondrous and non-actional, yet it manifests according to the times; the human heart possesses awareness, and one should accumulate merit wherever one is. Though I, Xuanzhen, am but a lowly being, the least among the three realms, I aspire to return to the mysterious through the wondrous Dharma, merging Confucian conduct with the Dao. Upon glimpsing the Emperor’s scripture, I treasured it more than rare jewels. I studied it word by word, hoping to attain enlightenment through its text. Yet the sacred canon lacked annotations, making comprehension difficult. Thus, I humbly gathered explanations from various sources, compiling the sayings of immortals and sages into the Daoist Canon. For the three fascicles of true text, I arranged them in order; for the five ranks of secret discourses, I assigned chapter titles. The work spans ten fascicles, totaling six hundred pages, comprising one hundred and eight chapters and over one hundred thousand words. The heart-essence of a thousand sages is now clearly visible in these volumes; the profound principles of countless kalpas lie open before the eyes. Though I have not yet fully penetrated the mysteries of the supreme sages, I have at least made the most splendid true texts accessible to all. Having contributed this small effort, I trust that good affinities remain. Choosing an auspicious morning, I reverently carve the text, relying on the support of virtuous patrons to bring it to completion.\n\nI submit this memorial in advance, hoping it may reach the mysterious gaze of the celestial realm, augmenting the pure blessings of ruler and people, and pardoning my humble presumption. May all realms and directions be fully illuminated by the seventeen radiant lights; may all ages, past and present, be molded by the thirty great vows. May all beings ascend to the profound mystery, and may both the living and the dead forever partake in the blessings of the Dharma. If even a fraction of my sincerity is realized, it will be more than enough.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\n*An Examination of the Sequence and Meaning of the Scripture’s Commentaries*\nThe original text of the scripture was sometimes presented as a single fascicle, following its original transmission, symbolizing the Supreme Ultimate. When divided into three fascicles, it symbolizes the Three Powers. The present commentary is arranged in ten fascicles, symbolizing the ten poles, for the Dao’s numbers are fulfilled in ten. The five ranks symbolize the five phases; combining the five phases, four images, and eight trigrams yields seventeen, all divisions of the Supreme Ultimate. Thus, the Emperor’s seventeen radiant lights enable Heaven to generate and Earth to complete. This scripture of the Jade Emperor is Earth’s way of nurturing the myriad things to perfection. The number of Earth is thirty, so the Emperor demonstrates thirty kinds of merit. The Emperor’s virtue surpasses the ten poles, hence his ten titles. Through eons of cultivation, his virtues are boundless. The present commentary’s six hundred pages symbolize the six hundred chapters of the *Fire Records*; its one hundred and eight chapters follow the Emperor’s one thousand eight hundred precepts. Its over one hundred thousand words symbolize the Emperor’s one hundred thousand wondrous acts and mysterious radiance.\n\nAs for the so-called *August Scripture Compendium*, it was compiled for those of lesser capacity who cannot fully grasp the sacred text, summarizing its essentials to instruct them. Knowing this principle, how could there be any conflicting interpretations?\n\n*Precepts on Reading, Reciting, Expounding, and Transmitting the Scriptures*\nWhen reading or reciting any scripture, or when expounding or transmitting it, one should first purify oneself, dress neatly, and arrange one’s countenance with solemnity before placing the scripture on a clean table. Sit upright, compose the mind, forget both good and evil, relinquish all views, and abide in serene emptiness. Only then should one calmly open the scroll—whether to silently read, recite aloud, elucidate, or teach—engaging with the Emperor as if in direct audience, maintaining utmost sincerity without interruption. This is how one upholds the precepts.\n\n**On Copying Scriptures and Precepts**\nWhen copying any scripture, the rules and rituals are the same as for reading or reciting. The mind must be upright, the brush held straight—not for the sake of fine calligraphy, but because this itself is the Dao.\n\n**Distinguishing Variant Scripture Titles**\nAccording to the *Baopuzi*: \"Highest\" (*Gaoshang*) refers to those above the seed-people, who have fulfilled heaven’s utmost limit, their elevation unmatched—what Buddhists call the \"stage of non-retrogression.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor is the most revered among sages, the most noble among spirits. All buddhas, sacred masters, and lords of the myriad heavens thus honor him as the Jade Emperor.\n\nAs Lü Chunyang said: \"The Dao is peerless in its loftiness, hence ‘Emperor.’\"\n\nThe Supreme Lord’s benevolence spans kalpas, his merits surpass all sages, perfectly good and perfectly beautiful—his praises are inexhaustible. Dwelling in the Jade Clarity Heaven, he proclaims the transformations of the Primordial Beginning, and so is titled the Jade Emperor.\n\nHan Xiang said: *The Original Conduct* recounts the Jade Emperor’s foundational path to sagehood, his wondrous practices through eons. *The Collected Scriptures* gathers the five sublime discourses of the Primordial Beginning into one scripture, revealing the true path of cultivation for later generations.\n\nGuangjian said: \"Only heaven is supremely high.\" The heaven where the Jade Emperor dwells borders the Jade Clarity, yet transcends all heavens—hence \"Highest.\" People, seeing the Jade Emperor’s exaltation, assume his virtue is unattainable, never realizing the sagely Dao is undivided: I stand shoulder to shoulder with the utmost sage. The Emperor’s loftiness, his wondrousness, are the fruits of his practice. Thus, the Heavenly Pivot Minister Zhang transmitted this scripture to inspire people to emulate the sage and attain perfection. The imperial decree states: *The Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Collected Scriptures* aims to enlighten readers, enabling them to trace the noble causes of the past and follow the footsteps of the utmost sage, thereby becoming a perfected one.\n\nLater, it is also titled *The Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Treasure Scripture*. \"Supreme\" (*Taishang*) signifies that which is immeasurably great and boundlessly high. It reveals the secrets of precelestial virtue, serving as the origin of all written teachings. \"Cavernous Mysterious\" (*Dongxuan*) denotes its illumination of the Three Luminaries and the manifestation of profound mysteries. The treasury of the mysterious and numinous is the dharma-treasure for countless generations of heaven-dwellers and humans—hence \"Treasure\" (*Lingbao*). In essence, scriptures elucidate the Dao, and the Dao resides within oneself. If one can fully realize their nature and destiny, awakening to this Dao, and practice it with wholehearted devotion, they may enter sagehood.\n\n**On Believing in Scriptures and Discerning the Rise and Fall of Virtuous Karma**\nHumans originate from the Supreme Ultimate. Heaven and hell are described in detail in the scriptures, yet the world remains skeptical—how could this be mere fabrication? Though death returns one to emptiness, those whose destinies are not exhausted possess souls bound by karmic deeds. Bo You became a malevolent spirit, and Zichan believed it; Confucius did not dismiss it. How could there be no hell? Those who purify themselves and return to the transformations of the old creation may ascend to heaven. Yet blessings cannot be seized by chance, nor can karma be evaded by luck. Heaven and hell are created by the human heart. To merely believe in their names without cultivating virtue is to invite disaster. Even if one speaks daily of karmic retribution, what benefit is there?\n\nWhen reciting scriptures, there are purificatory incantations for the mind and the like, but they are not recorded here. Since earlier instructions taught that the mind should unite with the Dao, reciting with sincerity is itself the true incantation—thus their texts are not included.\n\nThe original version of *The Imperial Scripture* begins with the thirty-six sacred titles, corresponding to the thirty-six heavens. Why does the present scripture only include ten proclamations? The ten titles align with the ten supreme attributes of the Emperor’s appellation, not chosen for brevity or complexity. Readers should consider this carefully.\n\n**Commentary on the *Highest Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Collected Scriptures***\nThis commentary is a direct annotation of the *Cavernous Mysterious Treasure Scripture*; later readers should not doubt it.\n\n**Prostrating in Reverence**\nThis scripture expounds the wondrous practices of the Jade Emperor as revealed by the Primordial Beginning. Thus, those who recite it should prostrate themselves in utmost reverence, sincerely offering their devotion.\n\nGazing upward, I invoke the Three Clarities’ realm,\nThe supreme and peerless lords of the Three Realms.\nKnowing the loftiness of the Great Dao and the exaltation of the Three Clarities,\nI aspire with earnest longing,\nReturning body, spirit, and life,\nTo convey my true heart upward.\n\n**Gazing in Reverence**\nI invoke the Jade Clarity, High Clarity, and Supreme Clarity.\nThe Three Clarities’ realms are supremely exalted and peerless.\nThe Jade Clarity’s sacred realm is the Primordial Beginning,\nThe High Clarity’s true realm is the Numinous Treasure,\nThe Supreme Clarity’s immortal realm is the Dao and its Virtue—\nThe Three Realms’ ancestral Great Heavenly Worthies.\n\nGazing upward, I invoke the Great Canopy Heaven,\nThe supreme and mysterious vault of creation.\nLü Chunyang said: The Jade Emperor’s dwelling is the heavenly origin of the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds, forever beyond retrogression. Unmatched in height, it is called the Great Canopy. The Mysterious Vault Lord governs the boundless azure, sovereign of all heavens.\n\nGazing upward, I invoke the Three Clarities’ realms,\nWhere the assembled hosts of perfected beings attend the Celestial Throne.\nZhang Ziyang said: \"Attend\" means to stand in array. The Celestial Throne is the unfathomably profound realm, beyond sight or hearing. \"Hosts\" refers to the multitude. The assembled hosts of perfected beings include the precelestial Nine Celestial Thrones, the postcelestial immortals and sages, all gods, buddhas, bodhisattvas, arhats, and vajras—all are present therein.\n\nThe wondrous Dao is beyond thought and discourse,\nThe utmost and singular vehicle cannot be grasped by mind or speech,\nDifficult to fathom through contemplation.\n\n**Entering to Cultivate the Mysterious Gate**\nZhang Zifang said: \"Entering\" means to progress through true knowledge and practice. The \"Mysterious Gate\" is the gateway of the Dao. The manifold wonders of the mysterious are profound and impenetrable; gradual advancement leads to awakening and entry into the Mysterious. This aligns with Mencius’ \"abiding in stability deepens one’s resources\" and the Buddhist \"progressing through hearing, reflection, and cultivation, ultimately attaining liberation.\"\n\n**The Wondrous Scripture Reveals the Profound Mysteries**\n\"Reveals\" means to uncover, to extract. \"Profound mysteries\" are the unfathomable and obscure. This wondrous scripture extracts the divine mechanisms from the true realm—this is the revelation of profound mysteries.\n\n**Guiding the Deluded in the Dust**\nThe Primordial Beginning expounds the wondrous scripture, revealing profound mysteries to guide those lost in the mundane, delivering them from the sea of suffering and liberating them from karmic destinies.\n\n**Now I Purify My Three Karmas**\n\"I\" refers to the one reciting the scripture. The \"Three Karmas\" are the karmas of body, speech, and mind. \"Purify\" means to devote oneself sincerely and forever sever these karmas.\n\n**Reciting with the Mouth and Upholding with the Heart.**\n\nThe reciter declares their sincerity in reciting this scripture.\nWith the mouth they chant, with the true heart they uphold and receive it.\nOnly hoping for great compassion,\nto accept this servant’s plea.\n\n*Compassion* is written in one version as *venerable*—*compassion* is correct.\nIn reciting and upholding this scripture, one only hopes that the Primordial Jade Emperor and all Perfected Ones will bestow great compassion,\nopen their merciful countenance,\nand accept this servant’s prayer.\nIf written as *venerable*, it cannot carry the intent of the preceding three invocations.\n\nThe compassionate light illumines the lowly,\nthe divine hearing attends to the recited sounds.\nMay the great compassionate light of all sages illumine this servant’s humble and sincere heart.\nMay the divine hearing listen to the sounds of prayer and recitation.\n\nHoping that when this servant chants the scripture,\nits Dharma-sound resounds through the ten directions.\nMay the recitation of this scripture cause its Dharma-sound to reverberate through the ten directions,\nso that all in the ten directions may hear and believe in the great Dharma—this is the resounding.\n\nMay all aspirations be fulfilled,\nas proclaimed in the scripture.\nMay this servant, through awakening to the scripture and cultivating the Dao,\nfulfill all good aspirations,\njust as the scripture describes the Jade Emperor’s wondrous practices through kalpas past.\n\nFrom this, may one gradually advance in cultivation,\nattain the great Dao,\nand serve all immortals and sages.\nWith utmost sincerity, one takes refuge and bows in reverence.\n\nIf sincerity is not complete, it is not *utmost sincerity*;\nif there is the slightest regret, it is not *taking refuge*.\nIn chanting this scripture, one maintains unwavering devotion and steadfast practice—\nthus it is called *taking refuge with utmost sincerity and reverence*.\n\nThe sacred realm of Jade Purity,\nwhere the Primordial One, peerless and supreme,\nthe Dharma King among heavens,\nwhose rank surpasses all immortals and buddhas,\ndwells in a realm that is eternally indestructible—\nthis is the sacred realm of Jade Purity.\n\nThe Palace of the Clear and Subtle Heaven.\n\nWithin the Hall of Lush Radiance and Verdant Terrace,\nthe supreme height of luminous realms,\nthe Heaven above all heavens—\ndivine light fragrant and luxuriant,\nserene in true purity.\nThus it is called the Hall of Lush Radiance and Verdant Terrace.\n\nAbove the vast expanse of pure, resounding echoes,\nwhere the profound and mysterious depths cannot be fathomed—\nthe heavens array myriad forms in boundless profundity,\nyet Jade Purity stands above all heavens.\nThus it is called above the vast expanse of pure, resounding echoes.\n\nManifesting the wondrous forms of conditioned existence,\nthe Primordial Heavenly Worthy, as the origin of the Three Teachings,\nreveals transformations to instruct humanity—\ntheir marvels beyond measure,\nthese are the myriad sublime forms of conditioned existence.\nPossessing limitless divine power,\nendowed with boundless, immeasurable spiritual penetration.\n(One tradition holds that the Primordial One is the boundless great Dao, hence the saying—yet the former explanation is correct.)\n\nExpounding and disseminating the true and mysterious,\nshattering the obstructions of non-being, being, form, and emptiness—\nbroadly proclaiming and elucidating the most profound and wondrous teachings.\nBreaking through the worldly barriers of non-being, being, form, and emptiness:\nNon-being takes non-action as its essence;\nbeing follows arising;\nform clings to existence;\nemptiness does not transcend the cycle of nihility.\nThe Primordial One, in expounding this scripture,\nreveals the true and mysterious,\nunconfined by the three contemplations,\nunbound by the two extremes.\nThrough direct pointing in clear words,\nthe thusness is immediately realized—\nthus shattering the stagnant obstructions of non-being, being, form, and emptiness,\nguiding one to the wondrous refuge of the Dao.\n\nDelivering and uplifting all sentient beings,\neradicating distinctions of wisdom and folly, high and low—\nrescuing and elevating all beings of karmic destinies from the dust,\nunrestricted by past or present, sage or fool,\nall may cultivate the Dao.\nThis is the eradication of all distinctions between wisdom and folly, high and low—\nthe wondrous Dharma of true oneness, undivided.\n\nIts sublime function is unfathomable,\nits numinous mechanism beyond measure—\nthe peerless sagely efficacy knows no bounds,\ndifficult to perceive;\nthe mysterious, divine Dao-movement cannot be gauged.\n\nWith great compassion, great vows,\ngreat sageliness, great mercy—\nboundless deliverance of humanity—\nthe Primordial Heavenly Worthy.\n\nGreat compassion: deep empathy for the world;\ngreat vows: limitless transformation;\ngreat sageliness: the sagest among sages;\ngreat mercy: inexhaustible salvation.\nBoundless deliverance of humanity: without limit.\n(Explanation of the Primordial One follows later.)\n\nWith utmost sincerity, one takes refuge and bows in reverence—\nthis refers to those who recite and contemplate the scripture,\noffering their true hearts in reverence to the Most Venerable.\nIt is not merely the recitation of these words by the mouth.\n\nThe sacred realm of Supreme Purity,\nthe luminous height of mysterious purity,\nthe most true and wondrous realm.\n\nThe Palace of Yu-Yu Heaven.\nFrom the First Azure to the Great White,\na wondrous realm of divine radiance and numinous transformation,\neternally indestructible, boundlessly vast,\nits divine workings without end.\nThe scriptures speak of the Primordial White Palace of Yu-Yu Heaven.\n\nWithin the Purple Tenuity’s Jasper Terrace,\na realm of ineffable mystery, forever unshaken and imperishable—\nthus called the Purple Tenuity.\n(Not the Purple Tenuity Enclosure of the Northern Asterism.)\n\nThe radiance of the Jasper Terrace’s Supreme Purity Palace,\nadorned with myriad treasures,\ndwells within the Jasper Terrace.\nAbove the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis.\n\nSupreme Purity lies above the White Jade Capital of the Great Mysterious Metropolis.\n(Alternatively, it may be said to lie above the Jade Capital Mountain of the Highest Heaven—both interpretations are valid.)\n\nIt connects to the lineage of the Primordial Celestial August,\n*Xi* (系): to continue, to inherit.\nIt is the thread of succession.\nAs the Numinous Treasure embodies the origin and enacts transformation,\nit thus ascends to join the Dao-lineage of the Primordial Celestial August.\n\nIt surpasses the root and sprout of the Western Na Jade Realm.\n(According to scriptural investigation, the Western Na Jade Realm lies in Shaanxi,\nthe birthplace of the White Emperor of the West.\nThe Numinous Treasure precedes the birth and transformation of all sages,\nhence it is said to surpass the root and sprout of the Western Na Jade Realm.\n*Yu-bai* [Primordial White] should not be conflated with the White Emperor.\nAnother interpretation reads *chao* [超, \"surpass\"] as *shao* [绍, \"continue\"],\nsuggesting the Heavenly Worthy as the root and sprout of the Western Na Jade Realm—this is incorrect.)\n\nEntering the pearl within a grain of millet,\ndrawing forth the essence of the true and mysterious;\nthe Heavenly Worthy enters the Mysterious Pearl within a millet grain.\n(This is akin to the Confucian \"ninefold play of the Great Ultimate\"\nor the Buddhist \"treasury of the true Dharma-eye.\"\n*Yi* [挹]: to grasp this Dao as one would a rare treasure,\nsatiating the deepest flavors—thus the phrase.\nIt means to fully draw forth the essence and purity of the true and mysterious.)\n\nWithin the Fragrant Grove Park,\nrepeatedly expounding the subtle expedients of secret essentials.\nThe Heavenly Worthy, in the wondrous Fragrant Treasure Grove of Supreme Purity,\noften discourses on the subtle expedients—the *quanti* and *titi*—of the mysterious and essential.\n(The Dao itself is ineffable; scriptures serve as the path of practice.\nLike the *quan* for catching fish or the *ti* for snaring rabbits,\nthey are not to be clung to—hence scriptures are called *quanti*.)\n\nIts wondrous virtue defies thought,\nits divine transformations elude comparison.\n\nThe Great Compassion, the Great Vows,\nthe Great Sage, the Great Mercy—\nboundlessly delivering beings,\n(as previously explained).\nThe Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.\n\nFrom the Azure of Beginnings to the Great White,\nthe Primordial Beginning once more reveals its wondrous transformations.\nDwelling in Supreme Purity,\nits numinous workings boundless,\nthe great Dao’s dharma-treasures are transmitted without end.\nThus is he called the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we take refuge and bow in reverence\nto the Great Clarity’s immortal realm, the Palace of Great Crimson Heaven.\nThe Three Clarities’ celestial palaces are originally one,\nyet through the vast radiance of the mysterious,\nwondrous and inexhaustible,\nit is called the Great Clarity’s immortal realm.\nPrimal White scatters its misty glow,\ncrimson auspices blanket all,\neternally indestructible—\nhence the Palace of Great Crimson Heaven.\n(This does not refer merely to the color red.)\n\nLofty, the golden towers rise,\nvast, beyond the layered heavens.\nThe Most High’s abode stands unshaken,\nsupreme and boundless,\npeerless, its golden light imperishable.\nThe mysterious towers reach so high,\nso distant they defy measure,\nforever dwelling above the ninefold heavens,\nthe ninefold layers, the ninefold skies.\n(Another tradition holds it crowns the thirty-six heavens.)\n\nBorn through measureless kalpas,\nthe Most High has traversed kalpas of transformation,\nboundless and unfathomable—\nthe great Dao’s mysterious teaching\nis born through measureless kalpas.\nExpounding the Dharma across twelve thousand heavens,\nthe Most High has, through the ages, transformed the triple-thousand great-thousand worlds.\nHere it speaks of teaching in twelve thousand heavens—\nthe Most High’s Dharma courts extend through twelve thousand celestial realms.\n\nFive thousand secret words\nfuse the wondrous Dao of the Three Powers;\neighty-one transformations\nuplift the beings of the Six Realms.\n(Or: uplift the beings of the six senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind—mired in the Six Desires.\nOr: uplift the beings of the six realms—existence, non-existence, form, emptiness, potential, and object.\nOr: from *zheng* [拯], meaning to rescue—awakening beings to the Dao and guiding them to perfection, the meaning remains the same.\nThe Six Realms are hard to escape;\nthe Most High extends compassionate teachings,\naiding gods, humans, ghosts, and creatures to transcend the dust—\nhence it is also written as *zheng*.)\n\nHis sagely virtue is lofty,\nhis mysterious merit vast and profound.\nThe Most High’s sagely virtue,\nexalted and majestic,\nhis mysterious merit broad and boundless,\ndeep and unfathomable—\nthus it is called *xuangong* [玄功].\n\nThe Great Compassion, the Great Vows,\nthe Great Sage, the Great Mercy—\nboundlessly delivering beings,\n(as previously explained).\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Descended Birth.\nThe Most High’s manifestations are measureless,\nhis merciful blessings inexhaustible,\nunceasing through all lives—\nhence he is called the Heavenly Worthy of Descended Birth.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we take refuge and bow in reverence\nto the Realm of Wondrous Existence, the Upper Palace of Miro.\n(The Upper Palace is the name of the Jade Emperor’s sagely father’s abode.\nIn the past, in former kalpas, he manifested as a king’s body.)\n\nLong ago, he manifested as the body of the King of Miaole in the land of Guangyan—this was the very substance of the Root Emperor, the very essence of the Most Merciful Venerable Lord of the Myriad Heavenly Saints. In the primal phase, his appearance was profoundly still and serene: the sagely father, the origin of Dao and its transformations, his wondrous form abiding in tranquil purity, motionless and unchanging. Truly most profound and most wondrous, beyond all description—this primal stillness of his appearance is indeed most mysterious and remote, most divine and subtle, defying all discourse.\n\nHe succeeded to the throne and inherited the transmission, his virtue peerless and unmatched, one following upon the other. He inherited the kingship of Guangyan, continuing the royal lineage, his power and virtue unrivaled, without equal or parallel. Following in the footsteps of his predecessors, his virtue and fortune flourished ever more abundantly—thus it is said his virtue is peerless and unmatched, one following upon the other.\n\nThe sagely father’s compassionate father, the Most High’s supreme venerable one. The Jade Emperor is called the compassionate father of all beings, occupying the most exalted position. The sagely father refers to the Jade Emperor. The King of Guangyan gave birth to the Jade Emperor—speaking of the sagely father’s compassionate father, the supreme venerable one. His praises are inexhaustible, devotion to him knows no end. The Jade Emperor’s merits are eternally manifest, thus his praises are inexhaustible, and devotion to him knows no end.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and Great Vows, the Father.

All dust and defilement are purified; its emptiness is luminous and wondrous, its subtlety unfathomable. Dwelling within the Three Clarities, it is the great celestial palace where the Jade Emperor resides. When the Primordial Beginning expounded the scriptures, he presided over this wondrous realm. His sagely and marvelous efficacy operates and transforms without limit, beyond all measure or comprehension. The scripture expounds this meaning as the supreme chapter—only those with divine wisdom and wondrous insight can fully comprehend it. Thus, it is called the First Chapter of Divine Transformations.*\n\nThis humble commentator, reflecting on ancient exegesis, observes: *That which transforms wondrously beyond measure is called \"divine\"; that which pervades universally without omission is called \"transformations.\" It crowns the five chapters and serves as the origin of the three scrolls. Those who grasp this at the Vermilion Terrace will understand the entire scripture.*\n\n**Chapter One: The Divine Transformations**\n\n**At that time, the Heavenly Venerable of Primordial Beginning—**\n\n*\"At that time\"* refers to the initial differentiation of the Boundless, the inception of the Great Mystery’s flourishing transformation, the wondrous juncture of the myriad sages’ karmic affinity—when this scripture was about to be expounded.\n\n*\"Primordial\"* means great and primary.\n*\"Beginning\"* means origin.\nThe flourishing transformation of the myriad sages originates with the Primordial Beginning.\nThus, he is called the *Heavenly Venerable of Primordial Beginning.*\n\n**In the Celestial Palace of Qingwei—**\n\n*For an explanation of the Celestial Palace of Qingwei, see above.*\n\n**Within the Jade Capital and Golden Gates—**\n\nThe Perfected One of Purple Clarity and White Purity states: *The Jade Emperor’s abode is the Jade Capital, its gates forged of gold—not the gold and jade of the mortal world, but wondrous transformations of divine power, where azure heavens and luminous jasper adorn the majestic palace-city. Hence it is called the Jade Capital and Golden Gates.*\n\n**The Mystic Garden of Seven Treasures—**\n\nThe White Perfected One states: *The Seven Treasures are: azure jade, jasper terraces, lapis lazuli halls, dragon-veined walls, white jade ramparts, cinnabar gates, and golden radiance suffusing all—thus named the Seven Treasures.* Another account lists them as: glass, crystal, pearls, agate, coral, amber, and giant clam. *The Mystic Garden* refers to the profound and recondite paradise.\n\n**The Jade Emperor’s palaces, ascending the Throne of Luminous Brilliance—**\n\nMaster Zhang Zifang states: *When the Primordial Beginning descended to the Jade Emperor’s hall, he ascended the sacred Throne of Great Luminous Brilliance.*\n\n**With an immeasurable host, he expounded the Dharma-gate of the Numinous Treasure, the Pure and Undivided True One.**\n\nZifang states: *As the Primordial Beginning ascended the throne, boundless perfected sages gathered. Thus it is said: with an immeasurable host, he proclaimed the wondrous, numinous, and precious Dharma—pure, unstained, and utterly true—the secret and marvelous essence of the Undivided True One, seamless and unadulterated, the Dharma-gate of Non-Duality.*\n\nThe *Collected Explanations of the Ten Directions* states: *The primordial spirit of humanity is the origin of nature and life. This is inherent to the Great Heavenly Venerable within the realm of Qingwei Heaven. The Jade Capital and Golden Gates, adorned with the Seven Treasures, are fundamentally possessed by all. The seven treasures of the human body—nature, life, yin, yang, spirit, qi, and essence—correspond to the luminous courts and mystic gardens, uniting heaven and humanity as one. When the Celestial Monarch is at peace, the Throne of the Jade Emperor’s radiance may be ascended. As the hundred constituents obey the command, concentrating the spirit and aligning with the Dao, one attains the Heavenly Venerable’s throne, joining the immeasurable perfected beings in proclaiming the Dharma-gate of the Numinous Treasure, the Pure and Undivided True One. Yet the Dao leaves no trace; only through luminous realization does one enter its secret and wondrous realm—as if upon a great road, with a path of entry. Hence it is called the Dharma-gate.*\n\n**Chapter Two of the Divine Transformations**\n\n**At that time—**\n\n*This refers to the moment when the Primordial Beginning ascended the throne.*\n\n**The Venerable Jade Emperor—**\n\n*Venerable Emperor* denotes his incomparable majesty.\n\n**With the various Celestial Perfected Ones, Flying Celestial Great Sages, Boundless Divine Kings, and jade maidens and numinous youths numbering ninety million, all observing a pure fast and bearing ritual regalia, stood in attendance beside him.**\n\nZifang states: *With* means together; *various* means many. *The Jade Emperor, together with the host of celestial immortals and perfected beings, wondrously assisted in transformation, ascending and delivering through divine power—the Great Sages of the Flying Celestials, the Divine Kings of the three thousand great realms and the boundless heavens beyond, the numinous youths of the Lesser Yang’s mystic qi who respond and attend, and the jade maidens of the Lesser Yin’s mystic qi who proclaim and transmit—altogether ninety million divine beings. Concealing their divine radiance and returning to the primordial origin, they observed a pure fast, held the jeweled regalia, and stood in attendance beside the Primordial Beginning’s Throne of Luminous Brilliance.*\n\nMarshal Tian You, Vice-Commander of the Primordial, states: *The human body possesses a true sovereign, the primordial spirit, whose numinous power is unrestrained. It also harbors Flying Celestial Great Sages, whose spirit and qi guard and support the entire body. In every interstice, there are Boundless Divine Kings, the mystic radiance of the Lesser Yang, and the numinous workings of the Lesser Yin—likewise possessing numinous youths and jade maidens. When the heart aligns with the Dao, the great tally of Yang’s vigor also becomes ninety million, as the body’s spirits pay homage to the origin. A pure fast means an unwavering heart; bearing regalia means the body is free from indolence.*\n\nA humble observation states: *Humanity and heaven-and-earth are of one kind; one should remain clear and unadulterated. When the primordial spirit governs the supreme pole, it is like Master Yan’s heart-fast or a ritualist’s bearing of the banner—singing reverence without duality. Then one follows the command of the Celestial Monarch and attains the Dao.*\n\n**Chapter Three of the Divine Transformations**\n\n**Thereupon—**\n\nAt this very convergence, the Jade Emperor, knowing the appointed time was nigh, exercised the power of the Six Penetrations before the assembly, releasing a radiance of great luminosity that suffused all heavens and boundless Brahma-kṣetra. Every realm trembled and quaked; the ten directions and all worlds without limit became as lapis lazuli and crystal, utterly transparent, without obstruction or hindrance.\n\nThe Divine Consort proclaimed: The Jade Emperor, discerning the moment when the mysterious light would unfold and the civil brilliance would commence—the time for expounding the Dharma and transmitting the scriptures—manifested the might of the Six Penetrations before the grand convocation. He emitted a light of supreme illumination, pervading the measureless heavens and the infinite celestial palaces of the divine emperors and perfected beings, all realms of the spirit’s dominion. Every domain shuddered and stirred. The worlds of all immortals and buddhas in the ten directions, without limit, became as precious lapis lazuli and crystal, their brilliance pure and resplendent, revealing all without concealment, leaving no place unseen or obstructed.\n\nMaster Zhang Ziyang said: The Six Penetrations are the penetration of sight, the penetration of hearing, the penetration of spirit-touch, the penetration of spirit-meeting, the penetration of past lives, and the penetration of foreknowledge—these correspond to the six penetrations of the Buddhist tradition, such as the divine eye. *Brahma-kṣetra* refers to the celestial abodes of the divine emperors, wondrous and resplendent in the heavens, untouched by the dust of the world, never decaying, towering and unshakable, invisible to mortal eyes—hence called *Brahma-kṣetra*. \"All realms\" denotes the domains where each spirit dwells. The boundaries of these realms encompass all worlds, not merely the human realm but also the celestial realms. Though lapis lazuli possesses form and light, it reveals all things within; the precious crystal, without flaw or leakage, leaves nothing unseen. The Jade Emperor’s radiance pierces all realms, illuminating even the hidden and obscure—how could there be any obstruction? The comparison is made lest one fail to grasp the meaning.\n\nA humble observation states: The luminosity of human nature is inherently unobstructed, but when the primordial spirit loses its mastery, barriers arise. One may hear but not see, or see but not hear; know but not speak, or speak but not know; obscure self and others, or confuse past and future—thus failing to attain the Six Penetrations. If one thoroughly comprehends nature and destiny, with the primordial spirit ever in command, then the light pervades heaven and humanity, penetrating within and without. The Purple Palace and the Cinnabar Terrace, the Yellow Court and the Mystic Realm—the original abodes of the body’s spirits, inherently celestial—all shine with radiance, unobstructed and fully illumined. Is this not like lapis lazuli and crystal, revealing all without concealment?\n\nYet while the Dao is inherently luminous, attaining clarity is no easy matter. One must not feign ignorance nor be misled by false knowledge. To grasp the truth neither too soon nor too late is a profound awakening. If one can emulate the Jade Emperor, perceiving the appointed time and manifesting light, ever renewing and abiding in constancy, then the great luminosity shall never dim, and the Dao shall forever shine forth.\n\n**Chapter Four of the Divine Transformations**\n\nThe sacred hosts of the ten directions all rode upon five-colored jade wheels, jade-like chariots, azure-green carriages drawn by nine-colored dark dragons, and ten peerless feathered canopies.\n\nThe Thunder Patriarch said: The ten directions are the four cardinal points, the four intermediate directions, and above and below. The sacred hosts are the divine and perfected beings of the ten directions. Beholding the light emitted by the Jade Emperor, they all rode upon wheels of five-hued patterned jade, resplendent chariots of jade-like splendor, azure-green treasure carriages, nine-colored dark dragons of radiant glory, and feathered canopies of unmatched excellence.\n\nBai Yuchan said: The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black. The *wheel* refers to the two wheels of a chariot; the *chariot* is the vehicle itself. The *carriage* is the general term for the imperial conveyance. The nine colors are blue, red, yellow, white, black, purple, azure-green, profound dark, and golden luminosity. The *dark dragon* possesses the semblance of dragon-light but no visible form. The *ten peerless* are those without equal in the ten directions, canopies of phoenix and luan feathers, wondrous and divine. The Daoist scriptures state: The *feathered canopy* is a high-handled feathered fan. Another account says that when the divine emperors and perfected beings travel, auspicious feathered regalia serve as their canopy—this latter explanation is even more sublime.\n\nA humble observation states: Humans, endowed with the primordial numen of the Five Agents—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—each possess dharma treasures. When immortals and perfected beings attain the Dao, these treasures accompany their divine conveyances. If one can silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor, emulating heaven, the spirits within the body gather, and the upright qi manifests its splendor. The jade wheel, the jade-like chariot, the azure-green treasure carriage, the nine-colored dark dragons of spiritual transformation, and the ten peerless feathered canopies—all once resided within the body. How could these be exclusive to the divine beings of heaven and earth? Alas, only those who have truly attained the Dao understand this.\n\n**Chapter Five of the Divine Transformations**\n\nUnicorns danced and phoenixes sang, solemn hymns resounded; divine consorts scattered flowers, golden youths wafted incense, chanting the profound verses of the Cavernous Chapters as they floated through the air.\n\nMaster Xu Jingtian said: As the sacred hosts journeyed, unicorns led the dance and singing phoenixes harmonized, their melodies refined and resonant, their songs clear and bright. Celestial consorts scattered blossoms of jade; attendant golden youths diffused auspicious incense, praising and chanting the sacred verses of the Cavernous Chapters, escorting the divine procession as it soared through the void toward the imperial capital.\n\nA voice from the ten directions proclaimed: When the divine emperor travels, divine youths and jade maidens follow in song, unicorns dance and phoenixes sing, with attendant maidens performing the dance of the unicorn and the song of the phoenix. Hence the saying: \"Their songs resound clearly.\" This interpretation is overly contrived. The unicorns and phoenixes accompanying the divine procession are akin to the imperial mounts of today. Moreover, the Daoist scriptures state: When the Celestial Emperor travels, dragons soar and phoenixes dance—such is the harmony of the celestial realm. It is also said that when dragons and leopards roar in the mountains and forests, their calls resound clearly. These are undoubtedly true unicorns and phoenixes. Otherwise, when Emperor Shun performed music on Mount Qi, why did the phoenixes appear in formation and the hundred beasts dance? Reflecting on the scriptures, one should adhere to the former explanation.\n\nThose of limited insight say: When one cultivates the Dao, silently aligning with the celestial principles, revering the Primordial Sovereign, and embodying supreme harmony within, the celestial pipes resound in song, the subtle meridians settle into tranquility—elegant as the dance of the unicorn, the cry of the simurgh and phoenix, their harmonious calls a joy to hear. The radiance of yang essence shines forth, the splendor of yin blossoms manifests, and one seems to glimpse divine maidens scattering flowers and golden youths wafting incense. The esoteric music and mysterious tones become the celestial hymns of praise sung by immortals, resonating with the primordial spirit. As if riding the wind through empty space, this is akin to the sacred assembly floating through the heavens to the imperial abode. Such potential lies within all, yet only those of resolve may witness its truth.\n\n*Chapter Six of the Divine Powers*\n\nAt that moment, Brahmā Heaven’s assembly of golden immortals, the great bodhisattvas of the Mahāyāna, and the fourfold hosts of the eight divisions—all bathed in this radiant illumination—rode upon golden and azure cloud-borne jade chariots. Clad in ninefold radiant garments, they streamed forth wondrous visions, celebrating the auspicious celestial assembly. The Three Luminaries emitted their fragrance, rare perfumes wafted from the eight directions, and the sacred throng circled and wove before the Dao. A rain of marvelous blossoms descended like clouds, blanketing the gathering.\n\nZifang remarks: At this time, all the Brahmās of the heavens, every awakened golden immortal, the great beings who have realized the Mahāyāna’s true path, the fourfold hosts of celestial spirits, demons, and ghosts, and the eight divisions of devas and dragons—all, illumined by this light, rode upon chariots of jade and gold, borne by flying clouds of golden and azure hues. Adorned in ninefold radiant raiment, they scattered wondrous visions to celebrate the propitious celestial occasion. The fourfold assembly gathered, and the Three Luminaries—sun, moon, and stars—emitted their fragrant splendor. Exotic perfumes drifted from the eight directions, and the sacred multitude presented these esoteric marvels, circling and weaving before the Great Dao. A rain of celestial flowers descended like clouds, covering the grand assembly.\n\nMagū explains: Brahmā Heaven is the most exalted jeweled forest and jade palace, unseen by the mortal world and hidden in ineffable mystery—hence its name. The golden immortals are those whose bodies are indestructible as vajra. The great bodhisattvas include holy beings such as Avalokiteśvara. The fourfold hosts comprise immortals, generals, male and female spirits—or, alternatively, celestial spirits, demons, and ghosts, all of which are valid. To speak of monastics and laity would be incorrect, for such beings rarely ascend to the celestial realms. The eight divisions are the spirit hosts, the general hosts, the deva and celestial soldier hosts, the vajra hosts, the dragon king hosts, the night-luminous handmaid hosts, the asura hosts, and the yakṣa hosts. The nine radiant garments are azure, multicolored, purple, cinnabar, cloud, mist, auspicious light, luminous, and universal treasure radiance. The ninefold mysterious light streams forth these wondrous visions, for they are the radiance of raiment—or rather, the marvelous adornments that follow the form of the spirit, not merely the garments themselves. The *Qingxiao* refers to an auspicious day, or the celebration of an audience with the Divine Empyrean. The four assemblies are the gathering of celestial goodness, the auspicious gathering of spirits, the gathering of timely conjunctions, and the gathering of karmic convergence—not merely the assembly of the fourfold hosts. The circling before the Dao refers to the fragrant wafting from the eight directions, or the sacred multitude’s encircling. The descent like clouds, covering the assembly, describes the marvelous blossoms falling as clouds to blanket the gathering—not merely the sacred throng descending like clouds, which would be overly contrived.\n\nThose of limited insight say: The human body contains myriad spirits, yet if the primordial spirit does not preside, the host of spirits will not manifest their numinosity. Only the true cultivator, silently paying homage to the true sovereign, may summon the myriad spirits to reverent audience. The mysterious light of the spirit palace and the hundred marvels all converge and appear. When the primordial spirit presides over the assembly, auspicious signs array themselves like propitious clouds covering all—then I and the celestial realm are no longer two.\n\n*Chapter Seven of the Divine Powers*\n\nAt that time, the Emperor’s light suffused all heavens, illuminating downward to the ten directions and boundless worlds, making them equal to the realm of the Mysterious Capital. All mortal realms, reaching upward to the Nine Heavens, were connected and intertwined, intimately near. The boundless worlds below—mountains and ridges, slopes and hills, ravines and valleys—all lay as level as the palm of a hand. The six directions were brought near, and the Three Realms were no longer distant. The jeweled terraces and palaces of heaven were scattered like stars among mortals. Rare jades and precious stones were arrayed in brilliance, illuminating the cloud-borne thoroughfares. Seven-jeweled balustrades demarcated the roads. Jade trees and immortal blossoms, resplendent with pearls and treasures, adorned the radiant Cinnabar Field. Lingzhi and sacred grasses spread in lush profusion.\n\nThe Perfected of the Celestial Realms remarks: At that time, the Jade Emperor’s light, from the thirty-six heavens of this world to the heavens of the three thousand great realms, shone downward to illumine all the boundless worlds of the ten directions, making them as luminous as the realm of the Mysterious Capital where the Jade Emperor dwells. All the worlds of the Dharma realms, bathed in this light, were without obstruction, reaching upward to the Nine Heavens of wondrous yang transformation. Heaven and earth, the mortal and celestial realms, were connected in luminous union, intertwined in utmost intimacy. All the boundless worlds below—lofty mountains and ridges, rugged slopes and hills, lowly ravines and valleys—lay as level and smooth as the palm of a hand. The six directions of above and below, the four quarters, were brought into closest proximity, and the Three Pure Realms were no longer distant. The jeweled terraces and palaces of heaven were scattered like stars among the mortal realm. Rare jades and precious stones were arrayed in brilliance, illuminating the cloud-borne thoroughfares. Balustrades of seven treasures marked the roads. Jade trees and immortal blossoms, resplendent with pearls and treasures, adorned the radiant Cinnabar Field. Sacred lingzhi and immortal grasses spread in lush profusion.\n\nShixinglin’s *Examination of Meanings* states: The dwelling of mortal kings is called the imperial capital; the Jade Emperor’s abode surpasses all heavens, unseen by the world—hence it is called the Mysterious Capital. Ordinarily, heaven is pure and earth is turbid; spirits are numinous and mortals are dull. Without connection, they are not intimately near. Yet when the Emperor’s light shines through, the numinous mechanism wondrously links them, so above and below are united, and spirits and mortals draw near. The Nine Heavens refer to the nine upper realms of the thirty-six heavens, not merely nine in number.\n\nMountains refer to those of great height and grandeur. A *ling* is a large mound or hill. A *po* is uneven terrain. A *ban* is the ruggedness of mountain ridges. Deep and long channels are called *gou*. Where mountains flank water is called a *jian*. Where water flows and gathers is called a *xi*. The great hollows of mountains are called *gu*. *Mian* signifies vast and level expanses. Though land naturally possesses mountains, waters, valleys, and ravines—thus being inherently uneven—when the Emperor’s light suffuses and illumines it, wondrous intent overflows, and all the lands of every world become level.\n\n*Qiong* denotes fine stone; *gui*, jade-like gems. *Fenran bingchen* describes their profuse and splendid array. *Yunqu* are the celestial roads at heaven’s summit. Horizontal barriers are called *lan*, vertical ones *shun*—what the world terms railings. *Qian* signifies the radiant brilliance of blossoms. *Zhubao* are the true treasures of pearls and gems. *Dantian* refers to the cinnabar field of the Mysterious Capital’s cinnabar steps.\n\nAs the *Guanshi* observes: The human body contains heaven and earth. When the primal mysteries of yin and yang fail to unite, above and below become distant and estranged. Yet when the original spirit commands the light and celestial radiance blazes forth, earth and heaven harmonize in supreme balance, above and below merge, and all unevenness and curvature become intimately and wondrously conjoined. The treasures innate within the body, when marvelously manifested and spiritually reflected, differ in no way from those of heaven. The *dantian*, the domain where spirit is mastered, reveals extraordinary scenes and luminous visions: numinous *lingzhi* are nurtured, their lush profusion presenting auspicious omens, while railings and balustrades are adorned with immortal blossoms—no need for distant seeking.\n\nIn the *Eighth Chapter on Spiritual Penetrations*, at that time, all below in the lower realms beheld the wondrous music of the celestial spheres resounding from the various heavens, revolving and swirling in harmony with the Emperor’s light, their sounds naturally resonant and harmonious. Again, all saw *luan* birds singing in melodious cries and phoenixes joining in song, their airborne voices attuned to rhythm; dragons frolicking and *lin* beasts circling in dance, soaring and wheeling at heaven’s summit. Precious blossoms from the heavens scattered and drifted down in profusion, covering every road in every realm.\n\nAt that moment, mortals and sages alike were awestruck and amazed; darkness and obscurity dissolved into light. Heavenly beings and mortals rejoiced and exulted, leaping and dancing in jubilation. Ordinary folk and scholars of the Dao all attained flight and ascension, gazing upward at the towering jeweled terraces of kalpas’ height, looking downward upon the purple clouds suffusing the vast expanse of the *Miluo* realm. In all these worlds, every person and people attained the wondrous transformation of the Dao’s *qi*. Those with white hair and wrinkled faces were all transformed and delivered, their locks becoming dark and lustrous, their complexions ruddy and youthful. The young and strong, the tender and small, saw their forms and features enhanced, their appearance radiant and resplendent, smooth and refined in exquisite beauty. All suffering and affliction were healed and pacified. Across the three thousand great worlds, the old and young alike universally awakened to liberation, enjoying peace and bliss, their hearts and minds filled with joy. In every land beneath heaven, songs and hymns celebrated the great peace of the realm.\n\nThe *Celestial Venerable of Longevity* states: When the Emperor’s light pervades all at that time, the people of every world below behold the secret and wondrous music of the celestial spheres in each heaven, revolving and swirling in accord with the Emperor’s light, their sounds naturally resonant and harmonious. Again, all witness auspicious *luan* birds singing in melodious cries and divine phoenixes joining in song, their airborne voices attuned to rhythm; dark dragons dancing in play and auspicious *lin* beasts circling in spirals, soaring and dancing at heaven’s summit. Precious blossoms from the heavens scatter and drift down in profusion, covering every road in every realm.\n\nAt that time, mortals and sages alike were awestruck and amazed; hidden darkness dissolved into light. Heavenly beings and mortals all rejoiced and exulted, leaping and dancing in jubilation. Ignorant mortals and scholars of the Dao all attained divine ascent to the Jade Capital, flying upward to heaven, gazing upward at the towering jeweled terraces of kalpas’ height, looking downward upon the purple clouds suffusing the vast expanse of the *Miluo* realm. In all these worlds, every person and people universally attained the wondrous transformation of the Dao’s *qi*. The aged with white hair and wrinkled faces were all transformed and delivered, their locks becoming dark and lustrous, their complexions ruddy and youthful. The young and strong, the tender and small, saw their forms and features enhanced, their appearance radiant and resplendent, smooth and refined in exquisite beauty. All suffering and affliction were healed and pacified. Across the three thousand great worlds, the old and young alike universally awakened to liberation, enjoying peace and bliss, their hearts and minds filled with joy. In every land beneath heaven, songs and hymns celebrated the great peace of the realm.\n\nThe *Thunder Gate Messenger* states: The wondrous music of the celestial spheres takes gold as the chief of the eight sounds. The primordial tones of the supreme *Brahmā* realm are the indestructible essence of gold. All tones harmonize without discord or corruption—this is the origin of musical harmony. Some say that it is naturally balanced without need for tuning, a sound rarely heard in the world, hence it is called the music of the celestial spheres. Others say that the great creation is the vast *hongjun*, and the wondrous workings of the Dao’s transformation naturally embody supreme harmony; the marvel of celestial music is the transformation of great creation, hence it is called the music of the celestial spheres. *Yongyue huanxin* describes leaping and dancing for joy, hands and feet moving in delight. Eight *chi* make a *ren*. The jeweled terraces of heaven endure through countless kalpas without decay or destruction, hence they are called *jieren*. *Yangguan* means to raise one’s gaze; *fumian* means to lower one’s glance. *Ziyun Milo* refers to the precious realm of the Yellow and the Old, not merely the terraces below—thus there is a sense of both upward and downward contemplation.\n\n*Gan* is a deep blue with a reddish hue; *ganfa* refers to what is now called \"green locks.\" As the *Guanshi* observes: Humans possess yin and yang, their bodies divided into upper and lower. The *qi* above is always pure, while the *qi* below is always turbid. Only when *qi* intermingles without harmony do the upper and the wondrous become unseen and unheard, leading to decline, weakness, and depletion. Yet when one aligns with the great Dao, unites with the primal mystery, and radiates wondrous light, one truly hears the secret sounds and truly sees the mysterious transformations: the elegant strains of the celestial spheres, the *lin* and phoenix, dragon and *luan*, all manifesting their marvels. Auspicious blossoms drift and scatter, suffusing all with beauty; yin and yang’s *qi* bears fine fragrance, and the spirit is stirred in awe. All hidden recesses become luminous, above and below harmonize and flow freely—this is the leaping and dancing joy of heaven and humanity. When yin dissolves and wondrous intent ascends to the mysterious, even ordinary folk and scholars of the Dao ascend. Gazing upward at the azure-jeweled terraces, looking downward upon the pervasively mysterious realm, the land is prosperous and the people at peace, *qi* harmonious and spirit serene. The aged become strong, the pacified attain supreme balance, the deficient become abundant, sinews are renewed and marrow transformed, and one perpetually preserves supreme harmony, the body in perfect accord, delighting in this wondrous transformation.\n\nNot only do the aged regain youth and the young grow ever more radiant, but the world erupts in song, rejoicing in the great peace of the realm. Ah, this is indeed the truth! Those who comprehend savor it deeply.\n\n**Ninefold Manifestations of Spirit-Power**\nAt that time, the divine wind spreads far and wide, the myriad *qi* raise the life-giving essence; heaven quakes and earth splits, withered bones revive, sunken corpses and wandering souls all regain their forms. The iron-walled Fengdu, the eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms, instantly shatter—hell’s suffering souls are transformed and reborn in the heavens, and the torments of the Three Evil Paths are all at once released. Then, by the power of this radiance, all sin-laden multitudes are reborn in the great celestial palaces of the ten directions.\n\nWei Boyang said:\nWhen the world sings in joy of great peace,\nThe Emperor’s virtue and divine wind resound afar,\nThe wondrous myriad *qi* raise the tide of supreme harmony.\nQian’s creative impulse stirs, yang’s vigor moves in strength—\nheaven quakes with the mysterious chariot;\nKun unfolds its destiny, yin’s softness yields in compliance—\nearth splits to reveal the numinous depths.\nLong-withered bones revive anew,\nsunken corpses and scattered souls all regain their forms,\nunbound and undispersed.\nThe underworld’s Fengdu, the great Iron Enclosure,\neternally shrouded in darkness, the Nine Dark Prisons,\ninstantly collapse—no more gloom, no more dungeon bonds.\nAll suffering souls in the hells are transformed and reborn in the heavens.\nThe torments of the Three Evil Paths—hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts—\nare all at once released, their karmic debts forever dissolved.\nThen, by the power of the Jade Emperor’s mysterious auspice,\nthe illumination of the Dao’s light,\nall sin-laden multitudes are reborn in the great celestial palaces\nbeyond the ten directions, above the ethereal clouds, in the boundless void.\n\n**My humble observation:**\nNothing quickens the ten thousand things like the wind.\nThe Emperor’s transformation is profoundly subtle, its spirit inexhaustible,\npervading the entire dharma-realm.\nThose who receive it remain unaware—hence it is called the *divine wind*.\n*Qi* may manifest in colors, yet it has no fixed form—\nhow then can one speak of \"raising the essence\"?\nWhere *qi* flows, the Emperor’s virtue operates in silence,\nsupreme harmony overflows, saturating and moistening all—\nthus it is called *raising the essence*.\nThe \"quaking of heaven\" does not refer to thunder,\nbut to yang’s virtue flourishing in abundance,\nemerging from *Zhen* to bestow life.\nThe \"splitting of earth\" is not a violent rupture,\nbut the earth’s way rising from humility,\nyin settling and yang reviving,\nrevealing the marvel of nurturing growth.\nNo longer sealed, the earth’s hidden treasures are released—\nhence it is called *splitting*.\n\"Withered bones reviving\" does not mean decayed bones rising again,\nbut those whose hearts have died and forms withered.\nAwakening to the Dao and knowing truth,\nthey return yang and transform their bones—\nimmortals among men, withered bones reborn.\nThe *po* soul dwells in the body, delighting in death,\nfeasting on offerings.\nThose who live without understanding the Dao,\ntainted by worldly dust and defiled by attachments,\nlose their spirit at death, their *hun* dispersing and *po* scattering.\nSome cling stubbornly, others fall into sinful prisons,\ntheir *po* essence dissolving and drifting,\nphantasmal and adrift in karmic suffering—\nthe *flying po* of evil deeds.\n\"Regaining form\" means *hun* and *po* reuniting,\nno longer adrift or submerged,\nfreed from the terrors of sin and all underworld karma.\nFengdu’s iron walls, so rigid and unyielding,\nare all self-imposed barriers of sinful souls.\nThe Emperor’s radiance illumines the profound—\nwith a single gleam, sins vanish.\nThe prisons of eternal night, where no sky or sun is seen,\nthe Nine Dark Realms, all open to light;\nFengdu’s iron walls instantly crumble to dust,\nand the suffering multitudes of hell are reborn in heaven.\nThe torments of the Three Evil Paths are likewise released.\nAt that time, by the grace of this light,\nthe sin-laden multitudes are reborn in the great celestial palaces of the ten directions.\n\nWhat is a human life?\nSpirit complete, form whole, modeled on heaven and earth;\nyin and yang, the Five Phases—\nno aspect of nature is lacking.\nOriginally pervaded by supreme harmony,\npure and unstained,\nyet deluded by worldly enticements,\nmistaking the false for the real,\nclinging to dust and defilement,\ngrasping at illusions,\nonce attachments take hold, they become unbreakable.\nDeception deepens over time, leaving no room for enlightenment.\nJoy, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, fear, and shock—\nsudden terrors strike, the heart lacks constancy,\nrestless and ceaseless.\nSelfish desires torment the mind and burden the body,\nunheeding of warnings—\nthis is the \"sunken corpse and flying *po*,\"\nFengdu’s iron walls, the dark prison’s confinement.\nYet if one severs desire and forgets the self,\nletting the celestial ruler remain at peace,\nsupreme harmony becomes clear and penetrating,\nstirring the wind of *Xun*, circulating the great harmony,\npreserving the vast and pure,\nharmonizing the Dao’s pulse—\nthen the divine wind spreads far and wide,\nthe myriad *qi* raise the essence,\nyang bestows and yin receives,\ntheir interaction restores yang,\ndissolving boundless suffering,\neradicating endless dust,\nshattering eons of delusion and attachment,\nfreeing one from the karmic paths of darkness.\nThus heaven quakes and earth splits,\nwithered bones revive,\nsunken corpses and flying *po* regain their forms,\nFengdu’s iron walls and the Nine Dark Realms instantly collapse.\nYin dissolves and yang grows,\ndesire fades and principle returns,\nthe turbid is transformed into the pure,\nessence and *qi* refine into

Purple Palace.\nThus the suffering souls of hell are transformed and reborn in the heavens,\nthe torments of the Three Evil Paths are all at once released,\nand the sin-laden multitudes, by the power of this light,\nare reborn in the celestial palaces.\nThose born into this world—ponder this, treasure this.\n\n**Tenth Manifestation of Spirit-Power**\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor divided his body, pervading all the great celestial palaces, causing each to naturally manifest: white jade became their capitals, yellow gold their towers, with seven-jeweled numinous gardens and Great Radiance Halls, radiant thrones, banners, canopies, and parasols, rare treasures and wondrous flowers spread throughout. Then the Jade Emperor, with his divided body, filled all these places—within the white jade capitals, the yellow gold towers, the seven-jeweled numinous gardens, and the Great Radiance Halls upon their radiant thrones—universally expounding the pure and liberating Dao to the ten directions.\n\nMaster Zhongli Quan said:\nWhen that great radiance was released,\nthe Jade Emperor divided his dharma-body,\npervading all the great celestial palaces,\ncausing each to naturally manifest.\nWhite jade capitals, yellow gold towers,\nseven-jeweled adornments in the numinous gardens—\nall were like the Jade Emperor’s own abode.\n\nThe Great Radiance Mysterious Hall was fully arrayed with the Great Radiance Precious Throne, the Mysterious Banner of the Dao, ritual pennants, floral canopies, rare and wondrous treasures, and exquisite celestial flowers, spread throughout all the great celestial palaces. At that time, the Jade Emperor, with his wondrously divided body, pervaded each of the great celestial palaces, spiritually transforming the Jade Capital, Golden Towers, and Mysterious Gardens. Ascending the Great Radiance Hall, he mounted the Radiance Throne, where every divine seat shone with light. The Dharma Throne of the Primordial Jade Emperor radiated a light most wondrous, so vast it could not be measured, so divine it could not be described—surpassing even the Dharma King’s throne of the Buddha’s realm. Thus, the Emperor’s transformed bodies ascended these thrones, universally expounding to the ten directions the true, pure, and utterly pristine Dao of awakening and liberation. To expound is to illuminate and clarify its meaning.\n\nMaster Guan’s Humble Insight says: The primordial spirit of humans is numinous and unconfined, reaching everywhere without obstruction, fundamentally identical to the Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformations. The Purple Palace and Cinnabar Terrace are inherently no different from the celestial divine palaces; auspicious mushrooms and divine medicines are no different from the treasures and flowers of heaven. Yet people, ensnared by worldly profit, lose mastery of their primordial spirit, and so cannot circulate freely or penetrate all things, nor manifest numinous power at every turn. They forfeit their true purity and fail to attain the Dao of liberation. If one preserves truth and harmonizes with the Dao, silently revering the Spirit King, then numinous movement becomes universal, filling the entire body—just as the Jade Emperor’s divided bodies pervade all celestial palaces. The mortal form attains the wondrous, rare treasures manifest marvels, and pearl towers, jeweled halls, jade palaces, and jasper terraces become the golden and jade capitals and seven-jeweled mysterious gardens of heaven. The divine palace and cinnabar terrace are the Great Radiance Hall and its Radiance Throne. Qi harmonized and pulses flowing, light stirs and rosy clouds rise—these are the banners, pennants, and canopies. The flourishing of divine mushrooms is like the rare flowers of heaven. When the primordial spirit governs and presides over the cinnabar terrace, unfolding the numinous and revealing the mysterious, it is as when the Jade Emperor, with his divided bodies, simultaneously ascends each throne to expound the Dao. Our true nature endures through kalpas unharmed, without duality or admixture, unbound and unobstructed, fundamentally pure and unstained, naturally liberated. Its great luminosity is never dimmed. If one can spiritually govern and unfold the numinous, then the entire body becomes mysteriously transformed. Unconfined by the three thousand worlds, clearly understanding causes and conditions, never deluded about reality, inwardly and outwardly radiant and transparent, penetrating the divine and attaining transformation—this is the Jade Emperor universally expounding, clarifying, and teaching the pure and liberating Dao to all worlds. Those who comprehend may savor this meaning for themselves.\n\nIn the eleventh chapter on the Jade Emperor’s spiritual transformations, each of his manifestations was attended on left and right by immeasurable Celestial Perfected, Great Sages, Wondrously Accomplished Realized Ones, and Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens. These Jade Maidens possessed countenances of exquisite beauty, refined and wondrously unique. Their forms were adorned with celestial treasures rare and divine, their voices clear and penetrating, delighting all who heard them. From their bodies emanated a subtle, wondrous, and naturally liberating fragrance, its fragrance rich and pervasive, filling all the celestial palaces, the most wondrous and blissful pure lands, and every blessed place across all worlds.\n\nThe Queen Mother said: At that time, each of the Jade Emperor’s transformed bodies throughout the celestial palaces was attended on left and right by boundless Celestial Perfected, spiritually potent and transformative Great Sages, Wondrously Accomplished and majestically adorned Realized Ones, numinous and transcendent Immortal Consorts, and Guardian Jade Maidens. These Jade Maidens possessed countenances and forms of exquisite beauty and wondrous uniqueness, dignified, splendid, and radiant, surpassing all others in divine marvel. Their bodies were adorned with celestial treasures rare and divine, their speech and voices clear and resonant, delighting all who heard them. From their persons emanated a profound, subtle, and divinely wondrous fragrance of great liberation and natural purity, its fragrance rich and pervasive, filling all celestial palaces, the most divinely blissful pure lands, and every blessed gathering across all worlds.\n\nThe Exegesis says: The Wondrously Accomplished are those in whom all virtues arise without forced effort, their merit and power inexhaustible, naturally perfected as Realized Ones. Their spiritual powers are immeasurable, hence they are called Wondrously Accomplished. The Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens are deities transformed from the wondrous qi of the Yin and Brahman, guarding and serving the Perfected Emperor. All celestial maidens are so named. Free from desire and encumbrance, they differ from demonic women. Their virtue and merit complete, noble, beautiful, and revered, they remain purely unsullied and unadulterated—hence they are called Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens, not referring solely to the Empress. These Jade Maidens are as described: their countenances exquisitely beautiful—*shu* means beauty; *duan*, dignified and upright; *li*, splendid and radiant; *qi*, divinely wondrous and rare; *te*, surpassing all beauty, unmatched in the world. Their forms adorned with celestial treasures—celestial consorts, transformed by divine light and spiritual power, adorned with wondrous treasures, their bodies and countenances unseen in the mortal realm. Their voices clear and resonant—*yan* refers to speech, *yin* to sound.\n\nClear—voices and words distinct. Penetrating—pervading and universally heard.\n\nThe subtle and wondrous, liberated and spontaneous fragrance: the consorts, having attained profound awakening and great liberation, their mysterious mechanism unfathomable, their divine wonder immeasurable, require no artificial crafting—naturally exuding a fragrant aroma. Yet none know whence this fragrance arises, hence it is called subtle and wondrous. This scent is rich and pervasive—*fen* denotes the diffusion of a fine and beautiful aroma; *fu*, the dense and luxuriant fragrance that clings and lingers.\n\nPervading all heavens and the most wondrous Pure Lands—*zhou* means to reach all; *bian*, to extend broadly; *ji*, utmost. In each of the great celestial palaces, the Jade Maidens who attend and guard the transformed emanations of the Jade Emperor—this fragrance does not linger in one place alone but suffuses every world and all heavens, the most wondrous lands free from suffering. The great earth encompasses all worlds of mountains and rivers. Blessed realms—where worlds exist, there is generation and transformation, hence they are called blessed realms. Alternatively, it is said that only through reverence, sincerity, and faith may one perceive this rare fragrance. In every world touched by the Jade Emperor’s light, all beings awaken faith and encounter the wondrous scent of the Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens, hence they are called blessed realms. This interpretation also holds.\n\nAll sentient beings of the Six Paths who perceive this fragrance universally receive deliverance. These are the heavenly path, human path, demonic path, hell path, hungry ghost path, and animal path. Among the heavenly path, all celestial beings who can perceive this fragrance will have the Five Decays and Four Signs forever dissolved, their heavenly blessings ever-increasing. Among the human path, kings, ministers, and the multitudes who can perceive this fragrance will attain the joys of long life in the human and heavenly realms; should their bodies pass away, they will achieve the Way of liberation through *shijie*—the shedding of the mortal husk. Among the demonic path, all demons who can perceive this fragrance will dwell peacefully in celestial palaces, their struggles and battles at rest. Among the hell path, all sinful souls who can perceive this fragrance will escape the torments of hell and attain the bliss of Pure Lands. Among the hungry ghost path, all hungry ghosts who can perceive this fragrance will be sated, free from the torments of hunger and thirst. Among the animal path, all beasts who can perceive this fragrance will escape the sufferings of the animal realm and attain the joy of wisdom.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering states: All sentient beings within the Six Paths who perceive the spontaneous fragrance of the Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens universally receive the grace of transformation and deliverance. The beings of the Six Paths—namely, the celestial beings of all heavens, the human and heavenly beings of all worlds, the demons of all demonic paths, the sinful souls of the hell path, the destitute spirits of the hungry ghost path, and the karmically bound beasts of the animal path—if any among the celestial beings of the four kinds of heavenly realms can perceive the spontaneous fragrance of the Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens, the sufferings of the Five Decays and Four Signs will be forever eradicated, and their heavenly blessings will increase. Among all the human realms of the great earth, if emperors, ministers, and the multitudes can perceive this spontaneous fragrance, they will retain their forms and abide in the world, enjoying the long life of humans and heavens. Should their bodies pass into extinction, they will achieve the Way of *shijie*—unfettered liberation through the shedding of the mortal husk. Among all the heavens and demonic paths of the worlds, if any among the demon kings, demon folk, demon women, or demonic spirits can perceive this spontaneous fragrance, they will peacefully dwell in separate celestial palaces, their conflicts and battles at rest. Among all the underworlds and hell paths of the worlds, if any sinful souls can perceive this spontaneous fragrance, they will escape the torments of hell and be reborn in the bliss of Pure Lands. Among all the destitute spirits of the hungry ghost path, if any hungry ghosts can perceive this spontaneous fragrance, they will be filled and sated, free from the torments of hunger and thirst. Among all the karmically bound beasts of the animal path, if any beasts can perceive this spontaneous fragrance, they will escape the sufferings of the animal realm and attain the joy of wisdom and clarity.\n\nThe Perfected Immortal Sa states: The Six Paths are like roads, wherein beings undergo cyclic rebirth across six kinds of destinies, hence they are called the Six Paths. First is the heavenly path: heaven has thirty-six designations. The highest four heavens are called the Seed People, where the immortals of the Nine Mystic Palaces and Seven Treasures reside—what Buddhists call the stage of non-retrogression. Below the Seed People are the Four Revered and Mystic Heavens, which Buddhists call the Four Dhyāna Heavens of Form. Below the Revered and Mystic Heavens are the Four Heavens of Forgotten Images, which Buddhists call the Four Dhyāna Heavens of the Formless Realm. Below the Heavens of Forgotten Images are the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm. Below the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm are the six heavens of the Desire Realm. Each world contains thirty-six heavens, and all worlds are alike.\n\nThe four heavens of the Seed People are realms of wondrous emptiness and subtle existence, where divine transformations and mysterious spirits abide eternally without decay. Only the highest perfected immortals dwell there, with no celestial beings—thus they are not counted among the paths of celestial beings. The Four Revered and Mystic Heavens are realms where worldly defilements have only just been purified, their transformations still incomplete and not yet divine, not yet attaining the Great Vehicle. Though they surpass the human path, even they cannot escape the great kalpas. There are the Formless Realm, the Form Realm, and the Desire Realm. The celestial beings of these heavens are tall and majestic, their forms like gleaming silver. They do not rely on the illumination of the sun and moon, for they possess their own radiance. The celestial beings of the Sun and Moon Heaven stand five *li* tall, with their height increasing progressively to hundreds of *yojanas*—a *yojana* being forty *li*. The Daoist scriptures say: a *yushe* is a measure of distance. They wear celestial robes weighing six *zhu* and two *qian* and five *fen*. Their heads bear natural pearl crowns. Their eyes do not blink, their heads do not bow, they stand without leaning, their eyes shed no tears, and their bodies know no weariness. Yet if they do not awaken to the Great Vehicle, when their heavenly blessings are exhausted, their pearl crowns shatter, their eyes blink and shed tears, their bodies stoop and grow weary—then the Five Decays and Four Unlovely Signs appear.\n\nIf one receives the fragrance of nature with utmost sincerity and reverence, awakening to the wondrous origin of this scent, one suddenly realizes the Great Dao—without relying on external teachings to perceive this fragrance—and thus attains enlightenment. This is called \"the power to perceive.\" The Five Decays and Four Unlovely Signs are forever dispelled.\n\n\"Forever\" means \"eternal.\" Eternally freed from the suffering of decay, one’s heavenly blessings instead increase. With each turn, blessings grow boundlessly, never diminishing.\n\nThe paths of humanity differ: there are yin and yang, old and young, noble and base, rich and poor, sages and fools. Without attaining the Great Dao, one’s lifespan is short, death is arduous, and the corpse does not decompose. Across all worlds, whether emperors, ministers, high and low officials, or the countless masses—*zhao* meaning ten million, *shu* meaning multitude—the term *zhaoshu* encompasses all people, emphasizing their vast number. If they receive the natural fragrance and awaken to the Great Dao, perceiving its subtle and wondrous scent, they attain unhindered, long-lived joy in the human or heavenly realms. Even if they pass away, they may secretly shed their mortal form through *shijie* or transcendence: casting off the shell through seated or standing liberation, or seizing another’s body in rebirth. *Shijie* may manifest as apparent death followed by reappearance in the world, with both corpse and spirit departing, or as feigned death leading to ascension.\n\nAmong the demonic paths, their kinds vary. Some, like the *Gusiluo*, contend with the Heavenly Emperor, disrupting celestial order—such as the asuras and rebels. All demonic realms are either fond of war or create illusions and plagues, dwelling in constant unrest. If these demons perceive the natural wondrous fragrance and awaken to the true Dao, they turn from evil to righteousness, their dwellings become peaceful, and they remain in their proper stations. In the heavens, they occupy separate domains, no longer delighting in strife, conflict, or the suffering of war. Each finds respite and rest.\n\nThe suffering of battle arises from conflict, which brings injury, and war, which brings slaughter—victory and defeat alternate, enemies become foes. Thus, it is called suffering. Each attains rest, for though spirits do not invade demons, demons disturb them, and one must respond by subduing them. Now, having perceived the fragrance and awakened to the wondrous, demons dwell in peace without contention, and spirits are likewise undisturbed. Thus, both spirits and demons find rest.\n\nIn all worlds, hells bear many names: Fengdu, Blood Lake, Blood Gorge, Icy Hell, Fire Chariot, Knife Mountain, Sword Tree, River of Desire, Mind-Restraint, Iron Bed, Wind Blades, Iron Dogs, Bronze Serpents, Cauldrons of Boiling Oil, Sawing, Grinding, Flaying, Naraka, Tongue-Pulling, and the Thirty-Six Hells. All souls enduring punishment find it difficult to escape the suffering of hell’s imprisonment. Yet if they perceive this natural fragrance, they awaken and transcend, leaving behind the torments of hell to be reborn in a pure and blissful land.\n\nHungry ghosts, bound for kalpas in the ghostly register, may have slender necks and bloated bellies, or massive heads and emaciated frames; their throats may be blocked, or they may consume burning coals and smoke, molten copper, or iron pellets. For generations, they never taste water or food, enduring hunger, thirst, and pain, their suffering ceaseless. Yet if all hungry ghosts in these worlds perceive this natural fragrance and awaken to the Dao, the flavor of the Dao fills their bellies, sating their hunger and quenching their thirst. Their throats open, and the torment of starvation vanishes forever.\n\nIn the animal realm, all creatures born from eggs, moisture, or transformation—whether soft or wriggling—are included, not merely birds and beasts. Though nurtured within heaven and earth, animals lack wisdom and endure much suffering, from which escape is difficult. If all animals across the worlds perceive the natural wondrous fragrance and awaken to the Dao, they attain liberation, their karmic retribution ends, and they escape the suffering of the animal realm, gaining the joy of wisdom and understanding.\n\nAnimals are not without awareness, yet they cannot speak of the Dao or embody it; their forms differ, and their spirits are distinct. Some are domesticated for riding or labor, others hunted and slaughtered, trapped in pits, or butchered for kitchens—consuming fur and blood, their flesh and bones utterly devoured. Their suffering is beyond words. Yet upon perceiving the fragrance, they gain wisdom, for this is the power of the Emperor’s light.\n\nA humble observation: the two preceding passages share a single intent. The original spirit of the human body governs yin and yang; true sages, wondrous practices, and divine maidens all arise from it. Within the harmony of spirit, qi, essence, and blood, the subtle fragrance of liberation exists naturally—profound and ineffable. The balance or imbalance of qi, unless one is mad or foolish, also pertains to the Six Paths. If the Heavenly Lord is not at peace, one is bound by the Five Agents; if thoughts are not severed, one is disturbed by the ceaseless tumult of yin and yang. Thus, one is also subject to the turning of the Six Paths. Perceiving the beauty of the Six Ding Jade Maidens within oneself, smelling the natural fragrance of harmony and liberation, and illuminating the Great Dao—so that the original spirit ever shines—one beholds the Emperor’s light and attains transcendence. Forever freed from the dust of the mundane, unbound by the body, one is thus eternally released from the suffering of the Six Paths. Those who understand will savor this and grasp the meaning of these two passages.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Divine Powers**\n\nAt that time, the multitudes of beings born into the celestial heavens as retribution for their sins, having attained rebirth in these sublime celestial palaces, by virtue of the compassionate light’s embrace, awakened and each clearly understood the causes of sin and blessing. Together with their retinues, they performed celestial music, their melodies harmonious and resonant. Some texts render *ji* as \"art,\" while others use the character *ji*. Pronounced *zhīqiè* or *qújì*, it means \"with.\" The character *ji* is correct. Joyfully, they came before the Emperor.\n\nThese multitudes, each harboring sorrow, together raised their voices and said: \"We, your servants, have passed through countless kalpas, great and small, never beholding the Three Lights of sun, moon, and stars, ever dwelling in darkness and gloom. Cast into the Three Evil Paths of hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts, we have endured much suffering and affliction. By Your boundless grace, O Supreme Emperor, You extended Your skillful means and radiated Your compassionate light, taking pity and delivering us, so that we might all be reborn in the heavens. All our evil karmic retributions have been utterly extinguished, with no bonds or entanglements remaining. We have all attained rebirth in the celestial realms, gazing up in reverence to the Jade Emperor, each arriving before the primordial and most venerable Dao.\n\nWhen these reborn celestial multitudes of sinful beings had finished speaking, they bowed their heads and returned to their original positions.\n\nMaster Ge the Immortal states: When the time comes for the transformation through fragrant liberation, all the sinful multitudes of hell, hungry ghosts, and other paths who are reborn in the most sublime heavens—having been embraced by the wondrous, spontaneous fragrance—by virtue of the Jade Emperor’s great compassionate light’s embrace, are thus received. *She* (摄) means to guide, uphold, and preserve. *Shou* (受) means to receive and guide the hun and shen, summoning them to return to the true. The Emperor radiates His compassionate light, wondrously transforming true fragrance, embracing all sinful multitudes, who then awaken to the great Dao. *Jue* (觉) means to know the reason why. *Wu* (悟) means thorough comprehension. The sinful multitudes, awakened, escape the destinies of the Three Evil Paths, each clearly and penetratingly understanding the causes of sin and blessing. *Gen* (根) is called *yin* (因, cause). Where there is cause, there is effect. *You lai* (由来) is called *yuan* (缘, condition). Where there is condition, there is karma. Having clearly understood the causes and conditions of sinful karma and blessed virtue, together with their kin and affiliated kindred—*yu* (与) means \"together.\" The sinful multitudes, whether demons, ghosts, or karmic beasts, each have their own kin and affiliated groups—once reborn in heaven and enlightened to the Dao, they join with their kin to perform celestial arts and wondrous music. *Tian ji* (天伎), when interpreted as *yi* (艺, art), signifies that their mastery is all-encompassing. Coming before the Emperor—*yi* (诣) means \"to arrive.\" These reborn celestial multitudes of sinful beings, each containing sorrow within, together raised their voices and said: 'We, your servants, have passed through countless kalpas, great and small, never beholding the Three Lights of sun, moon, and stars, ever dwelling in the dark and gloomy depths, cast into the Three Evil Paths of hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts, enduring much karmic suffering and sorrow. By Your boundless grace, O Supreme Emperor—*fu* (伏) means to bow the body low to the ground; *meng* (蒙) means to receive and be graced by. The phrase *fu meng* expresses the humility of the inferior receiving the favor of the superior. Henceforth, all instances of *fu meng* should be understood thus—we have been graced by Your universally applied skillful means, radiating great light. *Fangbian* (方便) refers to the wondrousness of the Dao, which universally benefits beings, hence called *fangbian*. With the radiance of Your compassionate light, You took pity and delivered us, so that we might all be reborn in the heavens. All our evil karmic retributions have been utterly extinguished, with no bonds or entanglements remaining. We have all attained rebirth in the celestial realms, gazing up in reverence to the Jade Emperor, each arriving before the primordial and most venerable Dao.'\n\nWhen these reborn celestial multitudes of sinful beings had finished speaking, they bowed their heads and returned to their original positions of attendance.\n\nThis humble commentator observes: Humans, endowed with yin and yang, are originally of the same essence as Heaven and Earth. Yet, deluded by profit and desire, they defile their true hearts, persisting in evil without repentance, dismissing the workings of karmic retribution and rebirth as nonexistent. Thus, they fail to recognize the causes and conditions of sin and blessing. The wondrous harmony of true intent is lost, obscured by the snares of worldly dust. Greed, anger, ignorance, and jealousy arise; madness, sorrow, and joy alternate; cravings and the pursuit of fame know no end. They abide in darkness, like the denizens of hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts in the Three Evil Paths, enduring ceaseless torment, suffering as the sinful multitudes do. This is the state of those whose evil karma is not exhausted, who remain bound and unable to be reborn in heaven. When the primordial spirit governs and the light of Heaven shines forth, the yin qi of the body, along with杂念 and evil destinies, are all restored to true qi, ascending to the realm of the Nine Yangs. The threshold between good and evil, the ordinary and the sacred, becomes swift as an echo, with karmic retribution manifestly clear. Thus, the rhythm of Great Harmony is released, revealing the numinous and secret, paying homage to the Primordial Emperor. This is how the sinful multitudes, embraced by the Emperor’s compassionate light, each clearly understand the causes of sin and blessing, joining with their kin to perform celestial arts and music, coming before the Emperor. As yin qi dissipates,杂念 are forgotten, evil destinies are purified, evil is transformed into good, and the spirit and life are returned to the Dao. Through repentance and awakening, they come to know the inauspiciousness of their past evil deeds. Those who fail to awaken to the great Dao are like those facing a wall or sitting at the bottom of a well—truly, they see nothing. Obscured by the paths of duality and multiplicity, they are beset by many fears. Only when the primordial spirit governs the Jade Terrace, descending the true and guiding the numinous, wondrously radiating the mysterious splendor, transforming the yin and completing the field, are they liberated from the dust of the mundane, forever free from entanglements. Their hearts become one with the Dao, silently paying homage to the Emperor. This is how the sinful multitudes, harboring sorrow, spoke of their suffering in the dark kalpas, having been graced by the Emperor’s light, which took pity and delivered them, extinguishing their evil karma, freeing them from bonds, enabling their rebirth, and allowing them to pay homage to the Emperor and arrive before the Dao. This is the most wondrous transformation of the celestial realms. To draw near is to take from one’s own body, for the Dao originally resides within. It urges people to turn inward and practice in reality. Thus, the four lines above—'bowed their heads and returned to their original positions'—require no further elaboration. Those who understand will ponder this deeply.\n\nThe second volume of the *Commentary on the Imperial Scripture* concludes.\nThe third volume of the *Commentary on the Imperial Scripture* begins.\n\nThe Fifty-Fifth Celestial Master of the Han Succession, Great Perfected Zhang Guoxiang, collated\nExamined by Retired Scholar Fangwai of Jishui, Jiangxi, Luo Hongxian\nCompiled by Zhou Xuanzhen of Xiaozhaochen, Jinan, Shandong\n*Chapter on Divine Penetrations*, Thirteenth Section\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor emitted a wondrous voice, universally addressing the sacred assemblies of the ten directions: \"All of you, listen carefully. These multitudes of sinful beings, across vast kalpas, have indulged their unenlightened nature, committing the ten evil deeds, polluting the six defilements, and entangling the three karmic actions. Recklessly following their desires, they have never awakened, accumulating hidden sins and manifest transgressions day by day, month by month. Turning their backs on the Dao and deviating from truth, they follow perversity and abandon rectitude. With every thought and intention, they bind themselves to faults and errors. Thus, after the end of their lives, they fall into the three evil destinies, unable to attain liberation. Had they not encountered this Dharma assembly today, by what means could they escape?\n\nThe Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity stated: At the time of luminous embrace, the Jade Emperor emitted a wondrous voice. This wondrous voice is pure, resonant, and radiant, pervading the three thousand great worlds so that all may hear—peerless in its marvel. Hence, it is called the wondrous voice. It universally proclaimed to the celestial emperors, sacred perfected beings, and divine assemblies of the ten directions and all worlds: 'All of you, listen carefully.' *You* refers to *these*. *Listen carefully* means to listen with focused and true attention. The Jade Emperor instructed the sacred assemblies to listen carefully to his teaching, then spoke of these multitudes of sinful beings in the three evil destinies across vast kalpas. *Vast* means boundless and remote. From past kalpas until now, these sinful beings have indulged their unenlightened nature. Though their nature is originally numinous and bright, they give free rein to their desires, acting with madness, confusion, and disorder, following their impulses without returning to their original numinous and awakened essence. Thus, it is called the unenlightened nature. They commit the ten evil karmic obstructions. The *ten evils* are: three bodily evils—killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; three mental evils—greed, hatred, and delusion; and four verbal evils—divisive speech, harsh speech, frivolous speech, and false speech. The accumulation of these ten evils leads to karmic retribution, hence called *evil deeds*. The six defilements thoroughly pollute. The *six defilements* refer to the impurities of the six senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Alternatively, they may be understood as wealth, sensuality, fame, food, sleep, and self-serving desires—these six defilements are also valid. Both inner and outer aspects of the body are tainted by defilements, with no purity remaining; thus, it is called *thorough pollution*. The three karmic actions entangle. The *three karmic actions* are the three poisonous evils of body, speech, and mind. Alternatively, they may refer to past karmic causes, present transgressions, and future karmic consequences—this interpretation is also valid. *Entangle* means to coil, and *bind* means to constrain. Accumulated karma is as heavy as a rope binding a person, preventing liberation; thus, it is called *entanglement*. Recklessly indulging their thoughts without restraint, they act according to their whims, unaware of self-examination, giving free rein to evil without any period of awareness or repentance. Sins unseen and unheard by others, known only to oneself, are *hidden sins*. Transgressions witnessed by all, which cannot be concealed or corrected, are *manifest errors*. Day by day, they accumulate; month by month, they deepen. Turning their backs on the great Dao, they defy truth, follow perverse paths, and abandon the correct Way. With every thought and intention, they lack sincerity and rectitude. Following the impulses of delusion, they bind themselves to faults and errors. Thus, after the end of their lives, they fall into the three evil destinies—hell, hungry ghosts, and animals—unable to awaken or transcend. Had they not encountered this wondrous Dharma assembly today, by what means could they escape their karmic suffering?\n\nI, the foolish one, observe: The spirit and qi of the human body are divided into yin and yang, pure and turbid. Indulging yin tendencies, following turbid and evil impulses, submitting to perverse thoughts, and abandoning true intention—these brew transgressions and make it difficult to escape karmic suffering. The longer evil accumulates, the less one understands the origin of karmic retribution, and thus they remain unawakened. When the original spirit is firmly settled, the wondrous intention spreads forth, the entire body receives its numinous influence, and one silently aligns with the profound mystery. Yang grows while yin diminishes; transgressions are dissolved, and sins are extinguished. Merging with the Dao and uniting with truth—all arises from the great awakening of wondrous enlightenment, recognizing the causes and conditions of faults and sins. The ancients regarded the pursuit of knowledge as the gateway to entry, and indeed, they saw clearly. Moreover, human nature admits no duality; good and evil both arise from the mind. The unenlightened nature is none other than the Dharma-nature. Thus, when it is obscured, one becomes an ordinary being; when it is awakened, one becomes a sage. The distinction between sage and madman is as thin as a hair’s breadth. If one can gather their emotions and return to their nature, stabilize their destiny and refine their spirit, grasp the subtleties of principle and desire, and understand the origin of defilements and evil, they will suddenly transcend karmic suffering, silently align with the profound mystery, and realize the Jade Emperor’s emission of the wondrous voice to proclaim the causes of indulging one’s nature and committing evil to the ten directions. Through encountering the Dharma assembly, beings of karmic types escape the three evil destinies. If one regards the unenlightened nature as a burden and seeks truth apart from it, dividing into two paths, one will fail to unite and attain the wondrous. Scholars should ponder this and naturally understand the essentials of transcending the ordinary.\n\n*Chapter on Divine Penetrations*, Fourteenth Section\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor, in the transformed bodies of the various heavens, employed divine penetrations. Without moving from his place, he transported and received the celestial beings, enabling all to arrive at the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm of the Clear and Subtle Heaven, beneath the assembly of the Primordial Beginning. These multitudes were unaware and unknowing. At that time, the Heavenly Worthy and the assembly beheld the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperors from the ten directions, all gathering before the Heavenly Worthy’s assembly, like an infinite bright mirror reflecting all images, mutually containing and entering one another. Then, the great assembly bowed their heads, gazing reverently upon the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperor—the most venerable among the sacred—deepening their pure faith and increasing their joyful aspiration. Their minds were unwavering, arising in great steadfastness.\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign stated: At the time of the great compassionate light universally embracing and receiving, the Jade Emperors in their transformed bodies within the various celestial palaces employed their great divine penetrations, majestically unmoving. Through the wondrous transport of their embracing and receiving divine light, they moved and guided the celestial beings of the various heavens, enabling all to arrive at the Clear and Subtle Heavenly Palace, the most supreme Jade Clarity Sacred Realm, beneath the assembly of the Primordial Beginning, the Ancestor of the Dao.\n\nThe Jade Clarity is incomparably revered, the great, pure, tranquil, and profoundly subtle heaven. The sacred □ realm is where the Most Real presides, the wondrous existence within the Void—where no ordinary spirits may easily arrive, the land of unwavering resolve. Beneath the assembly of the Primordial Beginning, none but the greatly divine and sagely, those of exceptional karmic affinity, may behold and gaze upon it. When the scripture was expounded, all the celestial beings arrived, for the Jade Emperor’s divine and compassionate reception enabled them to reach it. Thus, the great assembly of celestial beings, unaware and unknowing of how they came to be there, were blessed to arrive beneath the assembly of the Primordial Beginning. At this time, the Heavenly Venerable was none other than the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable. Some mistakenly believe these to be the various Heavenly Emperors, but this is not so. At this moment, beneath the assembly of the Primordial Beginning, the entire assembly beheld the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperors from all ten directions universally gathering, arrayed without obstruction before the grand assembly of the Primordial Beginning, like an immeasurable host of great luminous mirrors reflecting the forms and images of all beings, mutually containing and interpenetrating without hindrance, drawn in without omission.\n\nAt this time, the great assembly prostrated themselves, touching their foreheads to the ground in reverence, gazing with joyful admiration upon the divine transformed bodies of the Jade Emperors—the most exalted among the sacred and true. The Jade Emperor is the sagely teacher of all buddhas, the sovereign of the myriad heavens, and thus is called the most venerable. Their pure and sincere faith deepened, their joyful aspiration grew ever more steadfast, their devotion to the Dao and return to the Real unwavering. Only with unchanging resolve is there true sincerity; only with genuine delight in the Great Dao is there true return and offering. The great assembly, overjoyed at beholding the wondrous transformations of the Jade Emperor, were filled with heartfelt reverence, thus their joyful aspiration increased, and they turned wholeheartedly in devotion. Without thoughts of retreat or wavering, they arose in great steadfastness and unwavering faith. A mind that retreats is not steadfast; a mind that wavers is not firm. Without steadfastness and firmness, there is no pure faith or joyful aspiration. Only in gazing upon the Jade Emperor with a mind free from retreat do they arouse the greatest, unchanging, and indestructible true resolve, forever returning to the Great Dao.\n\nI humbly observe: the spirit and qi of humans share a common origin, whether pure or turbid, their wondrous transformations are without duality. If the mind does not align with the Dao, even with guiding and directing, it remains not the true path. Thus, the spirit does not congeal, the numinous is not revealed, and the secret transformations cannot manifest their marvels. If the primordial spirit congeals in truth, wondrously gathering all existence, silently paying homage to the True Emperor and assembling in the mysterious palace, true suchness is naturally at ease, without need for contrivance. This is like the Jade Emperor’s transformed bodies, their divine penetrations unmoving, yet transporting and receiving celestial beings to the assembly beneath the Primordial Beginning in the Clear and Subtle Heaven. When qi and essence mysteriously unite, silently following the Emperor’s decree, unknowing and unaware, the primordial spirit moves with numinosity, illuminating the body’s myriad wonders without constraint or leakage—thus the great assembly, unknowing and unaware, ascends in spirit to the upper realms. The Primordial Beginning and the assembly beheld the gathered transformed bodies of the Emperors, like great luminous mirrors, their radiant lights shining forth, all images mutually containing and interpenetrating.\n\nWhen qi and essence merge with the spirit, returning to the secret and the true, free from defilement and falsity, joy and ease arise naturally. Once attained, it is forever attained, never destroyed nor lost—just as the great assembly, gazing upon the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperor, recognized their supreme venerability, deepened their pure faith, increased their joyful aspiration, and without thoughts of retreat, arose in great steadfastness. Scholars should inwardly embody this to perceive its wonder.\n\nAt the time of the fifteenth chapter on divine penetrations, the celestial beings who had recently ascended to heaven suddenly beheld the Heavenly Venerable’s victorious assembly and the site of the Dao’s practice—the foremost in purity, adorned with the merits of non-action. Overwhelmed with exultation and joy, they all prostrated themselves in reverence, marveling at what they had never before witnessed. At that moment, the transformed Jade Emperors from all ten directions merged into a single body, seated upon the Dharma throne. The pure assembly within the Dharma banquet, wishing to hear of the Jade Emperor’s original practices and realizations, dared not yet inquire.\n\nZhang Guo stated: When the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperor universally gathered, the celestial beings who had recently drawn near to the Emperor’s compassionate light ascended to the Great Mystery and were born in the Clear and Subtle Heaven. Suddenly, they beheld the Jade Emperor, the Great Heavenly Venerable, in the most victorious and beneficial assembly. An assembly is where ordinary people gather to see one another. If the benefits of the gathering are limited, it cannot be called a victorious assembly. When the Primordial Beginning expounded the Jade Scripture and the Jade Emperor manifested his compassionate light, all beings across the Dharma realms universally gathered, and gods, humans, and all beings eternally received great benefit. Opening the flourishing fortune of the Three Teachings, propagating the mysterious essence of the myriad Dharmas—this was the most excellent and finest of Dharma banquets. No assembly across the kalpas could compare, its merits supreme and eternally indestructible, thus it is called a victorious assembly. Within this assembly, the Primordial Beginning praised the virtues of the Jade Emperor and transmitted the Dharma of the Most Real—the supreme vehicle—universally liberating the world to awakening, thus it is called the site of the Dao’s practice.\n\nThis victorious assembly and site of the Dao’s practice were utterly free from worldly defilement, wondrously pure and luminous—the foremost in purity. The Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformations arise naturally, universally bestowing eternal benefit through his mysterious merit, without need for contrivance. The sands of the world receive his grace, eternally bathed in his blessings. The Jade Emperor never acts with intention, nor does the Primordial Beginning act with deliberation. The myriad heavens yield their merits, all buddhas yield their virtues. Through excellent karmic affinity and wondrous assembly, merits and transformations universally manifest—truly adorned with the merits of non-action. The celestial beings, beholding this, were filled with boundless joy, truly not knowing whether to dance with their hands or leap with their feet, so exultant and overjoyed were they. The entire assembly prostrated themselves, touching their foreheads to the ground in reverence, exclaiming that never in all the kalpas had they witnessed such a wondrous, victorious assembly and site of the Dao’s practice.\n\nAt this time, the transformed Jade Emperors from all worlds merged into a single body, seated upon the great luminous Dharma throne. The pure assembly within the Dharma banquet—those called the pure assembly—had ascended by the Emperor’s light, their long-accumulated dust instantly dissolved, utterly free from defilement, thus they were called the pure assembly. The great assembly beheld the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperor manifesting in the various celestial palaces across all worlds, all bathed in radiant light.\n\nAt this moment before the Primordial Beginning’s assembly, they once more became a single body—neither did their manifold manifestations reveal any lack, nor did their unity show any excess. In an instant they divided, in an instant they merged, their divine subtlety beyond comprehension, their cause unknown. Possessing such divine penetrations, the assembly all thought as one, desiring to hear the Jade Emperor’s fundamental practices, his cultivation of truth and verification of sagehood, yet none dared presume to pose the question.\n\nI observe: Within the human body, spirit and qi nourish and protect, meridians and vessels interpenetrate, exterior and interior mutually adhere, emptiness and numinous responsiveness intermingle, movement and stillness mutually root one another—originally one part yet manifesting as ten thousand, the ten thousand all returning to a single source. Yet when humans are constrained by qi, obscured by things, ensnared by craving and delusion, then the bright becomes dim, the numinous stagnates. Some may study the Dao to aid the world, yet with petty wisdom and private benevolence, feigning merit and virtue, their kindness and favor finite—how could this be called the Dao? If one begins well but ends poorly, acts well but achieves ill, or forces oneself to sustain partial efforts, straining to grasp a handle, then whether gathering or dispersing, though appearing spiritually efficacious, this is not the subtlety of the Dao.\n\nIf one can truly awaken and comprehend, universally illuminate and penetrate, stillness and response all settled, without the disturbance of grasping or rejecting; if the numinous operates in silent accord, without the labor of forced effort—then the mechanism of the Dao subtly abides. The human heart retreats to listen, the turbid returns to clarity, the stagnant returns to the numinous. Alone, one awakens to true attainment, joyful and at ease, freed from constraints and obscurations, wondrously renewed each day. Thus do the gods and humans of the heavens, upon beholding the Heavenly Worthy’s pure and transcendent Dao-site, its effortless merit and adornments of virtue, leap for joy and prostrate themselves, exclaiming that never before has such a thing been seen. Gathering the ten thousand into one, the Celestial Lord ascends the throne—this is the ten directions’ transformed Jade Emperors once more seated as a single body upon the Dharma throne. If the pure assembly wishes to hear the Emperor’s practices yet dares not ask, then the root cause for expounding the scripture certainly cannot be spoken as one’s own experience. Those who study the Dao must secretly comprehend this, and the wondrous principle will naturally appear.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Divine Penetrations**\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies, saying: In a past age, there was a kingdom named Radiant Severity and Wondrous Joy. Its king was named Pure Virtue. At that time, the king had a queen named Treasure Moonlight. The king had no heir. One day, he reflected thus: *I* or *We*—which should I use? The king said to himself: I must not use *Emperor*. In past kalpas, I have never presumed to call myself *We*. It is proper to use *I*. Now I grow old, yet have no crown prince. If this body should collapse and perish—*bengmo*, meaning death—then to whom shall I entrust the altars of soil and grain and the nine ancestral temples?\n\nHaving thus reflected, he immediately issued an edict, summoning all Daoist assemblies to the various palaces and halls. Following the ritual codes, they hung banners and canopies, purified and adorned the space, and abundantly arrayed offerings. Throughout the six periods of the day, they performed the Dao, circumambulating the halls and praying to the perfected sages. Half a year passed, yet the king did not waver from his initial resolve.\n\nI observe: Human life in this body receives the principle of Heaven and Earth in its nature, the qi of Heaven and Earth in its form, and is born of father’s essence and mother’s blood. It is illumined by the light of sun and moon, sustained by the ruler’s governance and the land’s bounty, preserved by the sagely institutions, and advanced by teachers and friends of prior wisdom. With the Dao, one positions Heaven and Earth, nurtures the myriad beings, enters sagehood and transcends the mundane, unbound by birth and death. Without the Dao, all affairs shatter, one’s stench endures without cease, transgressions accumulate, and retribution continues unending. As a sage, though the body perishes, principle endures, co-eternal with the Dao—thus descendants continue the lineage, and ancestral sacrifices never cease. As a commoner, without heirs, the ancestral sacrifices are cut off. The distinction between sage and commoner is thus vast.\n\nThe threshold between commoner and sage—how vast is the distance? Should one recognize the weight of this bodily existence, knowing that birth is no mere coincidence and must not be squandered; comprehend the four debts of gratitude to be repaid and the five constants as no trifling matter; fulfill human relationships and illuminate all things; cultivate reverence through self-nurturance and advance learning through knowledge; embody steadfast solidity; and upon hearing goodness, act without fail—then, by day and night examining oneself, preserving integrity from beginning to end, feeling no shame even in the hidden recesses of one’s chamber, and sustaining utmost sincerity without pause, one’s virtue merges with Heaven and Earth, one’s clarity aligns with the sun and moon, one’s order harmonizes with the four seasons, and one’s fortune accords with ghosts and spirits. Awaiting sagehood without doubt, never slackening even for a moment, one lives in accord and dies in peace, returning to the original endowment of creation. The legacy of one’s name after death grows ever more radiant—such was the unyielding resolve of Prince Qi of the Kingdom of Guangyan in cultivating the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Marvels of Spiritual Penetration**\n\nOne night, Queen Baoyueguang dreamed that the Most High Lord of the Dao, accompanied by a host of perfected transcendents, appeared with golden countenances and voices of jade-like purity. They rode a five-colored dragon chariot, surrounded by luminous banners, shaded by canopies of radiant rosy clouds. At that moment, the Most High Lord of the Dao sat serenely in the dragon chariot, cradling an infant. The child’s every pore emitted billions of rays of light, illuminating the palace halls in hues of a hundred treasures. Preceded by ritual standards and floating through the void, they arrived. Overjoyed, the queen reverently received them, prostrating before the Lord of the Dao and addressing him: \"Our king has no heir. I beseech you to grant this child to rule our kingdom. I humbly pray for your compassion and mercy, that you may heed my plea.\" Then the Lord of the Dao replied to the queen: \"I willingly bestow this child upon you.\" The queen bowed in gratitude, receiving the child. Upon awakening, she found herself with child. After a year’s gestation, on the ninth day of the first month in the *bingwu* year, at the hour of noon, she gave birth in the royal palace.\n\nThe August Emperor of Vast Life declared: Prince Qi of the Kingdom of Guangyan never wavered in his resolve. In a single night, Queen Baoyueguang dreamed that the Most High Numinous Treasure Lord of the Great Dao, accompanied by a company of perfected saints, appeared with golden radiance and jade-like purity, their assembly suffused with immaculate divine light. They rode a five-colored dragon chariot, surrounded by resplendent banners, shaded by canopies of luminous rosy clouds. The Most High Lord of the Great Dao sat calmly in the chariot, holding a divine infant. From every pore of the child’s body emanated billions of auspicious rays, illuminating the palace halls in a spectacle of a hundred treasures. Ritual standards led the way as they floated through the void. Seeing the Lord of the Dao cradling the child, the queen rejoiced, receiving them with reverence and prostrating before him. She addressed the Lord of the Dao: \"Our king has no heir. I beseech you to grant this sacred child to rule our kingdom. I humbly pray for your great compassion, that you may take pity on our king’s lack of an heir and grant my request.\" The Lord of the Dao replied: \"I willingly bestow this child upon you.\" The queen bowed in gratitude and received the child. Upon awakening, she found herself with child. After a year’s gestation, on the ninth day of the first month in the *bingwu* year, at the hour of noon, the Jade Emperor was born in the palace of the Kingdom of Guangyan.\n\nI humbly observe: In human birth, with form and substance, there comes the responsibility of human relationships and the mandate of life. The body bears the weight of the fundamental principles, and life carries the duty of dual cultivation. Vast, luminous, spiritually penetrating, and free—this body is no mere vessel, nor is life a trivial matter. It is originally of golden essence and jade-like purity, unstained and immaculate. Yet through ignorance and delusion, one may slight the celestial treasure, failing to unite with the wondrous and divine, to conceive the mysterious and numinous. Thus, one squanders the most precious gift of one’s household, rendering this body useless. Even if one possesses some self-regard, without clarity in the Dao and genuine effort, one may feign goodness while harboring evil—golden without, yet rotten within. Such a person cannot even preserve their own being, let alone manifest the celestial nobility and inherent excellence. How then can one fulfill one’s form and perfect one’s nature, ensuring that one’s true master does not decline?\n\nIf one awakens to the profound root of life and death, grasps the secret essentials of Heaven and humanity, thoroughly understands yin and yang, and deeply comprehends the workings of creation; if one recognizes one’s ancestral lineage, knows one’s parents, sees that one’s birth arises from the earth and one’s origin from Heaven; if one fuses the golden elixir, refines the pure jade, attains the wondrous in the indistinct, and unites with the mysterious in the obscure; if one’s spirit of emptiness and non-being nurtures the true reality of wondrous being, forming the sacred embryo and giving birth to the divine child—then those who gave me life do not do so in vain, and those who nurture me do not do so idly. With sinews of gold and bones of jade, one transcends form and spirit, reviving what was withered and flourishing eternally—just as Queen Baoyueguang dreamed of the Most High Lord of the Dao and the company of perfected transcendents, who bestowed the sacred child upon her to rule the kingdom.\n\nA single person—awakened, one becomes an immortal; unawakened, one perishes. To understand the meaning of Queen Baoyueguang’s prayer for a child is to awaken to the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Marvels of Spiritual Penetration**\n\nAt the moment of his birth, his body radiated a brilliant light that filled the kingdom. His countenance was wondrously fine, and all who beheld him were never sated. As a child, he was keen and wise; as he grew, he was kind and benevolent. Throughout his kingdom, he distributed all the treasures from the royal storehouses to the poor, the destitute, the widowed, the orphaned, the childless, the solitary, the starving, the infirm, and all suffering beings.\n\nThe prince was benevolent, kind, and yielding; his governance was guided by the Dao, and his songs and odes spread far. The distant lands were transformed by his virtue, and all under heaven looked up to him in admiration, turning to the Benevolent Prince. His father, the king, rejoiced even more.\n\nThe Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: When the Jade Emperor descended to be born, his body radiated a hundred treasures’ brilliance, filling the entire Kingdom of Resplendent Light. His countenance and form were wondrously fine, and all who beheld him never grew weary. In his tender youth, he was keen and wise; as he matured, he was compassionate and virtuous. From all the storehouses and treasuries of his kingdom, he distributed every treasure and possession without restraint, as if scattering them all without hesitation or regret. Yet one might ask: if he were to give away all wealth, would he not forsake his sovereign, his parents, and his kingdom? The Jade Emperor, born with innate wisdom and perfect conduct, would never commit such excess. Let the reader consider this carefully.\n\nThe emperor’s distribution of the treasuries was not to perpetuate wealth and nobility but to aid those without means—the destitute and impoverished, the helpless and distressed, the widowed without husbands, the widows without wives, the fatherless orphans, the childless and solitary, those without mothers or any support, those without fathers or anyone to rely upon; those suffering in years of famine when grain did not ripen, or in times of hardship when even vegetables failed; those afflicted by illness, frailty, injury, or disability—all such suffering beings received the Jade Emperor’s relief and benevolent aid. His kindness arose from utmost sincerity, not mere outward display. His benevolence and compassion, warmth and humility, spread across the land, and all who benefited from his virtue sang his praises in odes and ballads, extolling his Dao. From the royal domains to the distant frontiers, his transformative influence reached the farthest corners. All under heaven gazed upon him in reverence and followed his example, turning to the Benevolent Prince. To \"turn\" is to align with him, as the *Analects* says: \"For one day to master oneself and return to ritual propriety, all under heaven will turn to benevolence.\" Seeking the Dao brings swift and great attainment. The Jade Emperor, born with divine marvels and growing in compassion, how could the world not turn to him in devotion?\n\nThus, as his virtue became manifest, the four quarters rejoiced and submitted. Even in his youth as prince, the signs of sagely and enlightened governance were already evident. Therefore, his father the king not only rejoiced at his birth but, seeing the prince’s Dao today, felt even greater joy and celebration.\n\nI humbly observe: When one is born between heaven and earth, possessing this body, one possesses the true vital qi of life. Only with this true vital qi can one be human. This true qi, when in heaven and earth, is the wondrous principle; when in the human body, it is the vast and unyielding. The true qi is mysterious and numinous, luminous and free, illuminating past and present, pervading the dharma realm. Endowed with this principle, one inherently knows no hardship, suffering, peril, or aversion. Yet when it descends from heaven, it is cast aside by humanity. The true nature of inheriting goodness and perfecting one’s character is treated as a trivial, non-urgent matter. Unable to fully embody the correct principle to nurture the true numen or cultivate the wondrous mechanism to achieve spiritual transformation, one remains obscured and unenlightened, given to anger, jealousy, and immorality; greedy for profit and fame, endlessly hoarding; unmoved by virtue, indifferent to the poor and suffering; arrogant and self-righteous, inviting slander and defamation. Such conduct harms the true qi, weakens the vast and unyielding, and casts oneself into the realm of the ordinary and foolish, unable to enter sagehood.\n\nIf one preserves the Great Harmony, congealing and merging the secret intent, the sacred embryo reveals its treasure light, and the divine infant emits wondrous radiance. Gradually unfolding the mysterious spirit, one achieves effortless spiritual transformation, viewing the mire of power and profit, the dust of honor and glory, as mere illusions. With one’s abundance, one aids others’ lack, relieving people and benefiting beings, extending kindness to all. Though the kalpas rise and fall, one’s merit and virtue remain inexhaustible. One’s盛德 and spiritual transformation become eternally renowned as an immortal, and the boundless kalpas of the dharma realm are all embraced by one’s compassion. Heavenly spirits and humans rejoice, revering and submitting to one’s supreme virtue. Such a one is the heaven-and-earth’s filial child, a rare being in the world, bringing glory and joy to parents. This is the divine marvel of the Jade Emperor’s birth and growth—his compassion and benevolence leading all under heaven to turn to benevolence, and his father the king to rejoice even more.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Marvels of Spiritual Penetration**\n\nAfter this, the king suddenly passed away. The prince, now governing, reflected upon the fleeting nature of life and instructed his ministers to ensure a virtuous succession. He then relinquished his kingdom and retired to the Fragrant and Resplendent Mountain to cultivate the Dao, where he perfected his practice and transcended the mundane.\n\nThe Dipper Mother said: After the Benevolent Prince of the Kingdom of Wondrous Joy had won the hearts of all under heaven, the king suddenly passed away. The prince ascended the throne, governing the kingdom’s affairs, and reflected upon the fleeting nature of life. To \"reflect\" is to look down upon one’s own existence and contemplate it. \"Fleeting life\" refers to human existence in the world, like floating clouds in the sky or duckweed upon the water, impermanent and uncertain—hence \"fleeting.\" The emperor, pondering this, issued decrees to his kingdom’s ministers and officials, entrusting the great treasure of rulership to a worthy successor, ensuring the virtuous continuation of the royal line. Another interpretation suggests he instructed the ministers to inherit the throne and practice virtue, which also makes sense. Having entrusted the throne to a worthy person, he abandoned his kingdom and secluded himself on Fragrant and Resplendent Mountain to cultivate the Great Dao. According to ancient records, Fragrant and Resplendent Mountain is the Stone Mountain in the Eastern Sea. Other mountains where the Jade Emperor left traces of his teachings are not the original site of Fragrant and Resplendent Mountain. After entering the mountain to cultivate the Dao, he completed his practice, transcended the mortal world, and ascended to the heavens to deliver beings.\n\nI humbly observe: Human life in this world is like a white colt passing a gap, like thunder and lightning in the void—suddenly appearing, suddenly vanishing, unable to preserve itself. Even one who is honored as the Son of Heaven, possessing all within the four seas, clad in dragon robes and feasting on delicacies from every land, upon death, all becomes an empty dream. Those of lesser rank, even the highest ministers with fields stretching across a thousand *li*, are not worth mentioning.\n\nMoreover, wealth and nobility are rarely shared with kin, while poverty and hardship are common. Yet people remain drunk in life, dreaming in death, deeply deluded and unenlightened. Thus, those who practice the Dao are seldom heard of—how much rarer still are those who become immortals! If one could awaken to the truth that the body is but a temporary lodging, life as fleeting as the mayfly, and suddenly break free from the dusty snares of the world, earnestly seeking the profound mystery, clearly perceiving and steadfastly practicing, without craving swift results, then when the time is ripe, transformation will naturally occur, and one will achieve the rank of immortal. Though one’s ancestors may have passed, they too are preserved by the sacred descendant’s arrival in Luoyang—thus, they do not perish. Was it not Prince Miaole, who relinquished his father’s throne to cultivate the Dao, achieving perfection and transcending the mortal realm?\n\nAlas! Within the human body lies Kunlun Mountain. When old yang is exhausted, a single yang is reborn. Detached from all extremes, one secretly cultivates the utmost truth, and over time, ascends through immortal transformation. The rarity of such an aspiration mirrors the Emperor’s own path—ponder this deeply.\n\n**Chapter Twenty of the Divine Powers:**\nAfter passing through this kalpa, spanning eight hundred kalpas, he frequently relinquished his kingdom for the sake of all beings, severing love to study the Dao. Thereafter, through another eight hundred kalpas, he practiced medicine to heal the sick, rescuing and delivering sentient beings, granting them peace and joy. When this kalpa ended, he passed through yet another eight hundred kalpas, widely performing expedient means, unlocking the treasures of the Daoist canon, expounding sacred scriptures, magnifying the true teachings, proclaiming divine works, aiding the nation and saving the people—from the hidden to the manifest.\n\nAfter this, through another eight hundred kalpas, he sacrificed his body and life, practicing forbearance and relinquishing his own flesh and blood. Through such cultivation over three thousand two hundred kalpas, he first attained the rank of Golden Immortal, known as the Tathāgata of Pure and Natural Enlightenment, teaching bodhisattvas to suddenly awaken to the true essence of the Great Vehicle and gradually enter the wondrous Dao of emptiness.\n\nThrough such cultivation, after another hundred million kalpas, he finally attained the position of Jade Emperor. When these words were spoken, the assembly of pure disciples unanimously exclaimed in wonder, declaring they had never before witnessed such sacred and wondrous conduct.\n\nMaster Xu Zhenjun said: After the Jade Emperor first relinquished his royal throne to cultivate the Dao, passing through these kalpas, he endured eight hundred kalpas as a crown prince. Each time he abandoned his kingdom, it was to deliver all beings—severing the bonds of the six relations to study the true Dao. Kalpas vary in duration: sixty years form a \"dust kalpa,\" five hundred years a \"cycle of flourishing destiny,\" three thousand years a \"leap kalpa\"; eighteen thousand eighty years a \"lesser kalpa,\" one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years a \"wheel-turning kalpa.\" Countless kalpas accumulate to form a great kalpa. Here, \"eight hundred kalpas\" is not confined to size but signifies vast duration—roughly eight hundred kalpas in all.\n\nDuring this time of severing love to study the Dao, after many kalpas, he endured another eight hundred kalpas, administering medicines to treat illnesses, rescuing and aiding suffering beings, granting them health and happiness. When this kalpa ended, he passed through another eight hundred kalpas, widely performing great expedient means, unlocking the scriptures of the Daoist canon, expounding the mysterious and numinous chapters, expanding and magnifying the great orthodox teachings, proclaiming and propagating divine scriptures, assisting the nation and delivering the people—from the hidden to the manifest, from darkness to light, extending blessings throughout heaven, earth, and the human realm.\n\nAfter these kalpas, he endured another eight hundred kalpas, unafraid to sacrifice his body, unconcerned for his life, practicing forbearance and enduring humiliation without resentment. He joyfully relinquished his own flesh and blood—just as one who gives away wealth feels as though parting with their own flesh. In a past kalpa, the Jade Emperor practiced forbearance and relinquishment, giving away his family’s wealth until reduced to poverty and peril. Though insults assailed him and others could not bear the suffering, he remained unmoved, never wavering or regretting. This was truly sacrificing his body and life, practicing forbearance, and relinquishing his flesh and blood.\n\nThe sage endures what others find unbearable to achieve what others cannot. The Emperor’s attainment of supreme sageliness required such sacrifices. Yet, as a sage transforming and delivering the foolish, he could manifest in any form, his true body never truly destroyed. Those who comprehend this spiritually should not cling to the literal words—then they will grasp the truth.\n\nFrom the eight hundred kalpas of severing love to study the Dao, through healing the sick, expounding scriptures to deliver beings, and practicing forbearance and relinquishment—such wondrous and arduous cultivation over three thousand two hundred kalpas finally allowed him to attain the rank of Golden Immortal, achieving the indestructible fruit, known as the Tathāgata of Pure, Natural, and Wondrous Enlightenment, the Dharma King. He taught bodhisattvas and great beings to suddenly awaken to the true essence of the Great Vehicle and gradually enter the profound, empty, and wondrous Dao.\n\nThe term *Tathāgata* signifies that all beings possess inherent nature, replete with myriad virtues. Its coming is equal to that of immortals and buddhas, fundamentally vast and luminous. Those who recklessly abandon it fail to preserve the endowment of heaven, obscuring their original true suchness to the utmost, thus falling into mundane karma. After the Jade Emperor relinquished the throne of Prince Miaole, he endured another three thousand two hundred kalpas, his merit and transformation boundless, never regressing, unattached and unpolluted. As the Dharma King of Great Awakening, he encompassed heaven and earth, perfectly nurturing all beings without excess or omission. Those who fully embody and return to this truth transcend all others—this is the meaning of *Tathāgata*.\n\nThrough such great cultivation over a hundred thousand kalpas, he finally attained the position of Jade Emperor, Lord of the Ten Thousand Heavens. When the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning had finished speaking, the pure assembly unanimously exclaimed in wonder, declaring they had never before witnessed such sacred and wondrous conduct.\n\nI humbly observe: Human life embodies yin and yang, thoughts encompass principle and desire. Yin and yang are mutually rooted, alternately waxing and waning; principle and desire cannot coexist in dominance. When desire stirs, yin congeals; when principle prevails, yang flourishes. Flourishing to the point of transformation, one wondrously enters the divine.\n\nOnly what is enacted proves ever fitting; nothing applied is ever amiss. The primordial purity of yang is the highest good—yet how few the indolent who can sustain it.\n\nMoved by this, the Jade Emperor expounded the wondrous meaning in full: relinquishing not one but countless royal thrones, he endured eight hundred kalpas to renounce his kingdom for all beings, severing bonds of love to study the Great Dao—this is the boundless pinnacle of sublime conduct. Moreover, the original spirit governs the numinous terrace, commands the five senses, and directs the hundred ministries. Among the six desires and seven emotions, love is the weightiest. To exhaust desire and restore principle, to gather emotions and return to nature, to strip away all embellishments and unite with the profound mystery—this is the Heavenly Lord’s abandonment of rank to study the Dao.\n\nRefining the elixir to save lives, he granted them peace and joy—thus the Jade Emperor endured another eight hundred kalpas to deliver the world. Mortals, deluded by toil and illusion, carve away their true intent, content to age and die without awakening—this is the world’s gravest affliction. Yet by congealing the three treasures of original spirit, essence, and qi into a secret, numinous fusion, reversing yang to transform the bones, one lives without delusion and dies without perishing—this is the inner vision of refining the elixir to save lives.\n\nExpounding scriptures to aid the nation, benefiting both the hidden and the manifest, the Emperor endured yet another eight hundred kalpas. Mortals who comprehend the profound and penetrate the secret, wondrously transmuting yin and yang, ascend as immortals to succor spirits and beings—this embodies the silent transmission of true scriptures to benefit both the unseen and the seen. Sacrificing life and body, forsaking flesh and blood, the Emperor endured another eight hundred kalpas. Mortals whose hearts remain unmoved, who relinquish their impure forms—this too embodies the resolve to endure humiliation and surrender flesh and blood.\n\nFrom kalpa to kalpa, his reverent cultivation never wavered, pure and unstained, wondrously transforming by nature. Enabling all to awaken, his merit knows no bounds—just as the Jade Emperor, from over three thousand kalpas to a hundred million kalpas, has never ceased such unparalleled wonder.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Divine Powers**\n\nAt that moment, among the assembly stood a Jade Maiden named Night Radiance. Rising from her seat, she adjusted her robes and crown with solemn grace, stepped forward with measured elegance, and knelt long before the Dao. She addressed the Celestial Venerable:\n\n“By what past merit, O Ancient One, did I once gain the fortune to attend in Your presence, personally offering reverent service for a hundred million kalpas? In the Three Clarities’ realm, the Golden Gates and Jade Capital, serene and untroubled, I roam carefree in bliss, wandering the sacred precincts, feasting on the sounds of the Dao, savoring their ineffable flavor. Yet never have I witnessed such a rare and wondrous event.”\n\n*As Master Guiguzi said:* When the pure assembly praised the Jade Emperor, among those in attendance stood a Jade Maiden named Night Radiance. Rising from her seat, she straightened her robes and crown—though already immaculate while seated, her dignity only deepened upon standing. With measured, graceful steps, she knelt long before the Dao Ancestor and addressed the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning: “By what past cause, O Lord, did I, Night Radiance, merit the fortune to gaze upon and attend You in the presence of the Heavenly Emperor? Some suppose Night Radiance refers to one in the Three Clarities’ realm, or inquires about the Jade Emperor’s divine radiance—this is mistaken. The Heavenly Emperor often attends the Three Clarities’ realm; when scriptures are expounded, the Jade Emperor’s great light is not always visible. Thus the Jade Maiden speaks thus, leaving no doubt she is the Heavenly Emperor’s attendant.\n\nNot once but countless times have I served in Your presence, personally offering reverent service for a hundred million kalpas. In the Three Clarities’ mysterious realm, the Golden Gates and Jade Capital, utterly serene and untroubled, I wander carefree in boundless joy, delighting in the sacred precincts, nourishing myself on the sounds of the supreme Dao. As for ‘feasting,’ the sacred tones of the Clear and Subtle Heavenly Perfected contain the highest, most wondrous principles, their flavor inexhaustible and not easily discerned. Though a divine being, I am but newly among the sacred ranks—how could I fully comprehend? Thus I listen to the Dharma’s sounds and savor them deeply, as one savors fine food. This refers to my past experience, not today’s hearing of the Celestial Venerable’s words. To interpret it as today’s hearing would miss the text’s original intent.\n\nNight Radiance has long dwelled in the sacred realm, serving in the Emperor’s presence in boundless joy. Hearing the Dharma’s sounds, she witnesses all wonders, comprehending them all, just as the Jade Emperor universally radiates his compassionate light, manifesting and gathering at will, creating and transforming with auspicious marvels. Through kalpas of cultivation, his merit is immeasurable, teaching and perfecting the sacred ranks, awakening them to the highest truth. Surveying the kalpas, gazing into the distant past, never have I witnessed such a rare and unparalleled event.\n\n*Humbly observed:* The yin within the human body is the immortal maiden. Jade-like bones, icy purity, radiant bearing, and refined demeanor—these are her innate qualities. Yet sullied by worldly dust and defilement, long obscured by grime, the true yin of Brahmanic qi sinks into impure thoughts and evil deeds; the six ding spirits of yin invert into hungry ghosts of impermanence. Endless thoughts churn ceaselessly, day and night restless, eating and sleeping without constancy. Flustered in movement, unable to attend the Supreme Emperor or serve the Mysterious Origin. Indulging in frivolity, craving splendor and finery, bound by fame and profit, burdened by worldly toil, she knows no carefree joy, rising and falling in the wheel of rebirth, endlessly descending into the mortal world. Unaware of the Dao’s wondrous Dharma, she daily indulges in passions and desires, stirred by demonic hordes, obstructed from wondrous transformations, making such encounters rare indeed.\n\nYet when the pure yang secretly transmutes, hatching the yin essence; when the luminous moon reveals its wondrous radiance without end, and the jade-like form displays its divine transformations without exhaustion; when all within the body becomes utterly numinous, the mechanism of transformation moves with ease, its wondrous mysteries revealed in crystalline clarity—then, in stillness, she pays homage to the Celestial Venerable and silently attends the Heavenly Emperor. Her nature and Dao remain ever luminous, and the human heart obeys her command.”\n\nWithin the realm of the Cinnabar Terrace and the Purple Palace, amid palaces of seven treasures and five luminances, all is serene, empty, and radiant—spacious, carefree, and blissful. The spirit roams the mysterious realm, the ears savor the sound of jade-like resonance. This is a rare spectacle of the world, a supreme event never before witnessed.\n\nThen the Moonlight Jade Maiden rose from her seat, adjusted her robes and headdress, and with graceful steps knelt before the Dao. She addressed the Heavenly Venerable, inquired about past causes, and entreated him to clarify the wondrous and rare transformations of the Jade Emperor.\n\nNow, the principles of yin and yang and the regulation of qi are common to all people. Those who attain the Dao employ the yin mechanism to manifest the divine powers of the Jade Maiden; those who do not revert to karmic destinies. Thus, the matter of cultivating the true cannot but be made clear.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two on Divine Powers**\n\nYet I do not understand: in the radiant light seen earlier, the ten directions of all heavens manifested sacred realms, wherein the responsive and transformative Dharma-bodies of the Jade Emperor appeared, attended by Heavenly Perfected Great Sages, Wondrous Practice Perfected Ones, and Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens. These Jade Maidens possessed dignified and majestic countenances, exquisitely beautiful forms, and emitted wondrous fragrances unmatched by any. By the Jade Emperor’s divine power of wondrous translocation, they have now all gathered in the Heaven of Pure Tenuity.\n\nI do not know by what karmic conditions this Jade Maiden has attained such a supreme physical form. I humbly beseech the sagely compassion to reveal what I have yet to comprehend.\n\nThe Lord of Southern Florescence said: The Moonlight Jade Maiden herself has declared that though she has long dwelled in the heavens and listened to profound discourses, she has never before witnessed the Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformations. Yet today, she speaks of the great radiant light that manifested the ten directions of all heavens, revealing sacred and true realms. (The character *bian* may also be read as *traverse*, and the meaning remains coherent.) Within these realms, the responsive and transformative Dharma-bodies of the Jade Emperor appeared, attended by the divine and immortal Perfected Great Sages of all heavens, Wondrous Practice Perfected Ones, and Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens as guardians and protectors.\n\nThese Jade Maidens possess dignified and majestic countenances, exquisitely beautiful and wondrous forms, and emit divine and marvelous fragrances unmatched by any. By the Jade Emperor’s great divine power of wondrous translocation and compassionate reception, all the attendants followed the Emperor’s light and have now universally gathered in the Heaven of Pure Tenuity.\n\nI do not know by what wondrous causes and excellent conditions these attendant Jade Maidens have attained such a supreme physical form. A *supreme physical form* refers to the wondrously transformed body of the Jade Maiden, which surpasses all and admits no comparison.\n\nNow, the world comprises six destinies: the three evil destinies of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals, which possess no beauty. The human body is but an aggregation of essence and blood; when qi scatters and spirit departs, its filth is indescribable. Moreover, in life, there is decline, old age, sickness, and suffering—thus, all beauty is but a dream’s illusion. Therefore, the body is called *illusory* and cannot be termed a *supreme physical form*. Beyond this, in the demonic destiny, all demonic maidens, though possessing extraordinary beauty, the five supernatural powers, and the ability to transform, ultimately bring calamity upon themselves when their karmic retribution matures. How then can they be called *supreme physical forms*?\n\nOnly these Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens possess peerless countenances and surpassing demeanor, transcending the Three Realms. Their celestial fragrance and wondrous transformations neither decline nor remain ordinary—such sights are unattainable in the mortal world. This is the *supreme physical form*, the nature of which even the Moonlight Jade Maiden cannot fathom.\n\nI humbly beseech the utmost sagely compassion to reveal the meaning of what I have yet to comprehend, that the Moonlight Jade Maiden may understand the principles behind the dignified beauty, wondrous fragrance, and exquisite forms of the Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens.\n\nIn my humble opinion: the blessings and karma of the world are all created by the mind. The mind governs nature and emotions; nature encompasses all. The wondrous transformations of yin and yang are inherently possessed by all. Without cultivating the Dao, one remains with yin as a dark destiny, a rotting corpse, the root of karmic rebirth. Through awakening to the Dao and cultivating the true, yin becomes the body’s upright qi, the Six Dings manifest wondrously, and celestial radiance shines in stillness. The true fragrance of the Jade Maiden is the marvelous function of the body.\n\nWith the entire body pervaded by mysterious communion, the Cinnabar Terrace and Jade Towers, the six yang secret realms, and the true king’s timely dominion—this Dharma-body broadly transforms, subjugating tigers and commanding dragons. Refining jade liquid within the Mysterious Palace, arraying the Azure Maidens to the right; gathering the secret treasures of the cinnabar spirit, floating the pure fragrance of the imperial consorts. This too is the manifestation of the Emperor’s light across the ten directions of heavenly realms, where the responsive and transformative Dharma-bodies of the Jade Emperor appear, attended by Perfected Jade Maidens, translocated by divine power to dwell in the Heaven of Pure Tenuity.\n\nEvery person possesses nature, encompasses yin and yang, and contains all wondrous potentials—body and heaven are one. The divine powers and wondrous models of the Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens should be known to all who hear and see them. How is it that the Moonlight Jade Maiden, having attained sagehood and become an attendant of the Emperor, has yet to comprehend this?\n\nNow, cultivation and realization have ranks of nobility and humility, and the sagely body arises from the transformations of the Dao’s source. The fruit attained determines the rank of divine powers—only sages know sages, only the worthy know the worthy, with no room for pretense. The Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens, through their celestial perfection, transform and save beings; thus, their luminous demeanor, wondrous countenance, and true fragrance are rightfully unknown to the Moonlight Jade Maiden. Her lack of knowledge stems from her recent attainment of the sagely body and differing rank, not from evasion or falsehood.\n\nAlas! If even the Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens are not easily known, how then can the divine transformations of the Emperor’s light be fathomed? If the Moonlight Jade Maiden cannot know them, how can others? Sage and mortal share one nature; humans stand shoulder to shoulder with the Jade Emperor. Yet if even knowledge is unattainable, how can one attain sagehood? Let all ponder this and strive.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three on Divine Powers**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Venerable addressed the Moonlight Jade Maiden, saying: You have only recently entered the sagely stream. Though you possess wisdom, you have yet to attain full clarity. These Jade Maidens, from immeasurable kalpas past, have cultivated wondrous practices, attained the gates of liberation, and shared in pure faith, pure understanding, pure mindfulness, pure conduct, pure bodies, pure minds, pure intentions, pure fruits, and pure retributions. They share in great compassion and great mercy, sheltering and protecting sentient beings as a mother cherishes and loves her infant child.\n\nUpholding the precepts with single-minded devotion, they inwardly align with the Great Dao, observe pure fasts, and uphold vast vows. Through myriad kalpas, they have revered the Jade Emperor with utmost devotion.\n\nThe Sovereign of Primordial Emptiness declared: When you, Moonlight, first beseeched the sagely compassion to dispel your unenlightened state, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable addressed you, saying: You have only recently entered the sagely stream. *You*—that is, *you*. *Sagely stream* means to stand in the same rank and company as the sages, forming one category with them. Having become a sage, one should know all things. Yet, having only newly entered the sagely stream, though possessing keen wisdom and intelligence, you have not yet attained full clarity and thorough understanding.\n\nThese Jade Maidens who attend and guard the Jade Emperor did not acquire their divine powers in a single day. Rather, from immeasurable kalpas past, they have cultivated manifold wondrous practices, fully attained the gates of great awakening and liberation, passed through kalpas unstained, and never retreated from the mind of true faith. The Jade Emperor’s long cultivation has always been in pure faith, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices in past kalpas are likewise in this pure faith.\n\nUnattached to form and appearance, they have attained great liberation. The Jade Emperor’s long cultivation has always been in pure understanding, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices in past kalpas are likewise in this pure understanding.\n\nWith true mindfulness of the unborn, they have transcended all destinies. The Jade Emperor’s long cultivation has always been in pure mindfulness, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices in past kalpas are likewise in this pure mindfulness.\n\nTheir wondrous practices adorn them, forever free from transgression or disturbance. The Jade Emperor’s long cultivation has always been in pure conduct, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices in past kalpas are likewise in this pure conduct.\n\nThe Dao embodies the physical form, unstained by defilement or impurity. The Jade Emperor’s long cultivation has always been in a pure body, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices in past kalpas are likewise in this pure body.\n\nMind is the Dao, and the Dao is mind—lucid and unattached. The Jade Emperor’s long cultivation has always been in a pure mind, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices in past kalpas are likewise in this pure mind.\n\nWithout inside or outside, without approach or reception, they have severed intentions and forgotten scheming. The Jade Emperor’s long cultivation has always been in a pure intention, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices in past kalpas are likewise in this pure intention.\n\nAbiding in the Upper Clarity, they never regress. The Jade Emperor, having attained sagehood, has realized the pure fruit, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices in past kalpas are likewise in this pure fruit.\n\nThrough vast kalpas, their merit is exalted beyond measure. The Jade Emperor, as the Most High, has received the pure retribution, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices in past kalpas are likewise in this pure retribution.\n\nTheir benevolence pervades the dust-mote realms, and their kindness extends through boundless kalpas. The Jade Emperor possesses great compassion, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices are likewise in this great compassion.\n\nAll myriad beings receive their tender care and pity. The Jade Emperor possesses great mercy, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices are likewise in this great mercy.\n\nThe Jade Maidens’ great compassion and mercy are one with the Jade Emperor’s. But how is this so? They shelter and protect sentient beings as a loving mother cherishes and tenderly cares for her infant child with a heart of redoubled affection. Moreover, they uphold the mysterious precepts with unwavering sincerity and single-minded devotion. Some say: reverently upholding the mind and strictly observing the precepts, they concentrate with utter purity and unity, thus inwardly and sincerely returning to the Great Dao. The meaning is even more profound.\n\nThe Jade Maidens’ return to the Great Dao is not momentary. With pure and solemn devotion, they uphold vast vows, and through myriad kalpas, they have always revered and honored the Jade Emperor.\n\nThis foolish one observes: Those who possess the mind of true faith will naturally attain understanding and awakening, sever deluded thoughts, purify their conduct, keep their bodies unstained, their minds clear, and their intentions pure. They will realize the fruit and receive retribution, ultimately attaining the utmost truth. Those who embody great compassion and mercy, strictly uphold wondrous precepts, and reverently serve the Supreme Emperor without wavering through the ages may ascend to the rank of Upper Immortals.\n\nYet worldly people, deluded by heterodox views, harbor杂念 and perverse conduct. They fail to cultivate their bodies, their minds are disturbed, and their intentions are chaotic. Their karmic retributions entangle them, all because they lack compassion and do not believe in the Dao. Thus, though Moonlight has newly entered the sagely stream, she still cannot fully comprehend the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices. To walk the same path as they do is even more difficult.\n\nThe Dao is inherent in all people. If one reflects upon and cultivates it well, the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices may be realized within oneself.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four on Divine Powers**\n\nThese Jade Maidens are not truly women; they are celestial perfected beings who, to deliver sentient beings, manifest as Jade Maidens. Therefore, their bodily forms, divine powers, wisdom, and transformations—whether hidden or revealed—are equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nAt that time, upon hearing these words, Moonlight attained awakening. She bowed her head in reverence, rejoiced, and silently returned to her place.\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: These Jade Maidens who attend the Jade Emperor, having cultivated manifold wondrous practices through immeasurable kalpas past, are not truly female in form. They are celestial immortals and perfected beings who, to transform and guide sentient beings of the Dharma realms into the Dao, manifest as Jade Maidens. Precisely because they are the transformed bodies of perfected beings—whose original forms are not female—their bodily appearance, divine powers, wisdom, and transformations, whether hidden or revealed, are not superficial but equal to the Jade Emperor’s.\n\nAll people possess bodies, yet the illusory nature of the physical form cannot divide or transform. Thus, it is difficult to share the same body as the Jade Emperor. As for the shape-shifting demons and ghosts, their bodies are deceptive and illusory, and thus not worth mentioning.\n\nAmong the celestial beings above, some may extend five *li*, or several *li*, or one or two *yojanas*, or hundreds of millions of *zhang*. Some reside in heavenly palaces, some perceive the true realm, and some appear among humans. Yet when they manifest in one place, they cannot transform elsewhere. Or, though perceptible to the senses, they cannot skillfully deliver beings, bound as they are to one location or one moment. None of these are the most supreme, wondrous Dharma bodies of transformation.\n\nThe transformed bodies of the Jade Maidens appear throughout all worlds, gathering and dispersing at will, surpassing all others. Their bodies are equal to the Jade Emperor’s. All bodies are composed of form, yet if form is not wondrously refined—or if it is beautiful but not enduring—it is not equal to the Emperor’s form. The transformed bodies of the Jade Maidens possess wondrous beauty, majestic and exquisite, fully manifesting wherever they appear, never changing or declining. Their form is equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nThe paths of heavenly beings, demons, and humans all possess spiritual penetrations, yet their transformations are limited, their powers not encompassing the six penetrations—such spiritual penetrations are not equal to the Emperor’s. The Jade Maidens’ divine transformations are boundless, fully possessing the six penetrations; thus, their spiritual penetrations are equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nDivine beings all possess wisdom, yet it is obstructed, not fully illuminated, or relies on borrowed perception, unable to achieve wondrous convergence—such wisdom is not equal to the Emperor’s. The Jade Maidens perceive all without omission, their foresight unobstructed; thus, their wisdom is equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nThose who know spiritual penetrations may all conceal themselves, yet concealment leaves traces—this is not equal to the Emperor’s. When the Jade Maidens disperse, they return to the Great Void, not merely containing Mount Sumeru within a mustard seed; their wondrous concealment leaves no trace, their concealment equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nWhere there is concealment, there is manifestation, yet manifestation is not the great radiance—this is not equal to the Emperor’s. The Jade Maidens wondrously manifest in the pure and subtle, their divine perception spanning all realms; thus, their manifestation is equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nPossessing spiritual penetrations, wisdom, concealment, and manifestation enables transformation. Yet if transformation is contrived, it is not equal to the Emperor’s. The Jade Maidens’ wondrous transformations arise without intention, their divine transformations spontaneous; thus, their transformations are equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nAt that moment, Yeguang, having heard the Primordial Beginning’s discourse on the Jade Maidens’ manifestations and transformations, attained clarity and awakening in his heart. He understood the wondrous causes of the Jade Maidens’ transformations, bowed in reverence, and rejoiced with delight. Silently, he forgot speech and returned to his original position.\n\nA foolish note: The yin and yang of the human body are not two distinctly separate entities but arise from one, becoming two—yin nurtures yang, and yang generates yin, rooted in the utmost origin. Cultivating truth to attain the Dao, the six yin spirits transform and manifest as Jade Maidens, wondrously changing. This marvelous mechanism shares the same function as the primordial spirit and mysterious numen. This yin transformation revealing numinosity is not unique to the earthly quality; it extends to the heavenly body’s nurturing, the transformation of yang’s radiance and Brahman qi. Moreover, the divine immortals of heaven transform without fixed form, teaching and delivering beings according to expedient means. When a male form is needed, they manifest as male; when a female form is required, they transform into female. Through countless kalpas, worlds abound in multiplicity. Those who ought to be delivered by a female form are beyond measure. Thus, the supreme divine immortals of heaven transform into Jade Maidens to deliver multitudes. Their bodily form, spiritual penetrations, wisdom, concealment, manifestation, and transformations surpass all divine beings and are equal to the Jade Emperor’s. Though Yeguang had visited the Three Pure Realms and long heard the Dharma’s sound, he had only recently entered the sacred stream. Such great spiritual penetrations and supreme, wondrous practices were naturally unknown to him. Nevertheless, the sacred and the profane share the same nature, and the Dharma body is universal. With a heart for universal salvation and emulation of the utmost truth, the Jade Maidens’ divine wondrousness equal to the Emperor’s resides within our own bodies. Thus, Yeguang, upon hearing this discourse, attained understanding and rejoiced. Those who comprehend should reflect deeply.\n\n*Commentary on the August Scripture, Volume Three Concluded*\n*Commentary on the August Scripture, Volume Four*\n*Collated by the Fiftieth-Generation Celestial Master of the Han Succession, the Great Perfected Zhang Guoxiang*\n*Reviewed by the Recluse Beyond the Imperial Examinations, Luo Hongxian of Jishui, Jiangxi*\n*Compiled by Zhou Xuanchen of Xiaozhao, Jinan, Shandong*\n*Chapter on Spiritual Penetrations, Twenty-Five*\n\nAt that time, the Lord of the High Void and Pure Brightness Heaven, together with his celestial retinue, rode the eight-scene simurgh chariot, beneath nine-rayed jeweled canopies. They performed the Mysterious Song and wondrous music, chanted the boundless Cavern Chapters, scattered celestial treasure flowers, and sprayed celestial perfected incense. Ascending in flight, they traversed the void and arrived before the Dao.\n\nBy the awe-inspiring power and virtue of the Heavenly Worthy and Jade Emperor, these myriad treasure flowers instantly transformed in midair into a single jeweled canopy, shading and covering the great assembly without exception.\n\nThe Master Red Pine said: When Yeguang Jade Maiden returned to her position, the Lord of the High Void and Pure Brightness Heaven, along with the celestial kin of his own heaven—or, as some mistakenly claim, the kin of another heaven—arrived. As the Lord of Pure Brightness Heaven and his retinue came, each rode the eight-scene radiant simurgh chariot beneath nine-cloud luminous jeweled canopies. The \"eight scenes\" are also called the eight treasured wondrous scenes, the eight trigram divine scenes, or the eight-hued luminous scenes. Generally, the divine chariots of heaven gather the scenes of the eight directions and embody the harmony of the eight solar terms, hence the term \"eight scenes.\" They performed the Great Mysterious Song and spirit-wondrous music, chanted the boundless merit of the Three Cavern treasure chapters, scattered celestial treasure flowers in all directions, sprayed celestial perfected incense, and, stepping upon the void, traversed the heavens to arrive respectfully before the Dao.\n\nBy the awe-inspiring power, virtue, and divine penetrations of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and Jade Emperor, these multitude of treasure flowers instantly transformed in the void into a single jeweled canopy, shading and sheltering the great assembly of the Dharma gathering without omission.\n\nThis fool observes: When mortals cultivate the truth, pay homage to the Supreme Emperor, revere the Primordial Sovereign, and silently recite the true scriptures, their pure void spirit-light will, upon later audience in the mysterious realm, manifest secret wonders—jade flowers forming canopies, universally covering all wondrous beings. All this is the secret guidance of the Void Sovereign and the compassionate reception of the primordial spirit. Thus, when the Lord of the High Void and Pure Brightness Heaven later arrived at the Dharma banquet, presenting wondrous music and riding the numinous chariot, the celestial flowers he scattered, by the power of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and Jade Emperor, formed a jeweled canopy covering all without exception. Those of aspiration who contemplate this canon and spiritually comprehend it will find that the wondrous transformations of heaven are fully possessed within their own bodies.\n\n*Chapter on Spiritual Penetrations, Twenty-Six*\n\nAt that time, the Lord of the High Void and Pure Brightness Heaven, beholding this rare spectacle, prostrated himself and knelt in reverence, addressing the Heavenly Worthy and Jade Emperor: \"This humble servant, indolent and remiss, arrived late to the Dharma assembly. Today, on this auspicious occasion, I have encountered the Dharma Bridge. The hidden and the manifest, the sacred and the profane, all universally partake of the sagely grace. A great radiance shines forth, revealing rare and wondrous signs, illuminating all heavens above. The Four Brahmā Heavens and Six Desire Realms, all the blessed lands and assemblies of perfected sages, beholding this radiance, gather in clouds. Below, it shines upon the boundless worlds of the lower realms, uniting with the Mysterious Capital, closely adjoining the Nine Heavens. Divine winds perform music, harmonizing palace and note, resonating brightly through the cloud courts, all transforming into Cavern Chapters. All beings universally attain the transformation of the Dao.\n\nIn the Fengdu Iron Enclosure, the eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms, all suffering beings in the hells, by the power of this light, are reborn in the heavens and enjoy bliss. Today, the scattered celestial treasure flowers swiftly coalesced into a canopy, universally covering the Dharma assembly. All in the great congregation partake of the power and awe-inspiring might of this light. Through a thousand kalpas of good causes and the cyclical movements of the Nine Heavens, the imperial Dao flows boundlessly, and the true Dharma flourishes. Today is most auspicious, as we behold and revere the mysterious merit.\"\n\nThe True Lord of Fire said: When the treasure flowers formed a canopy covering all, the Lord of the High Void and Pure Brightness Heaven, witnessing this rare event, prostrated himself and knelt, humbly addressing the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and Jade Emperor. He spoke of himself as a lowly and indolent servant, tardy in attending the Dharma assembly. Today, on this auspicious occasion, he encountered the compassionate salvation of the sagely Dharma Bridge. Bridges in the world are built by mortals to span waterways, sparing them from fording. Yet even the finest worldly bridges, constructed of wood and stone, have limited reach and are prone to decay; they cannot span great rivers, lakes, or seas. But the power of the sagely scriptures and Dharma transcends kalpas, pervades the cosmos, and requires no fabrication or trace. Through subtle transformation and secret divine penetrations, it enables beings to escape the river of love, depart the sea of desire, avoid the blood lake, and dispel great calamities—eternally indestructible, hence called the Dharma Bridge. It spans the hidden paths of darkness and the manifest realms of light. The sagely and the foolish, the wise and the ignorant, all universally partake of its sagely grace.\n\nThe Jade Emperor radiates the Great Illuminating Brilliance, manifesting a rare and wondrous divine form. Its light ascends to illumine all heavens of every realm—the Four Brahmā Heavens, the Six Desire Heavens, and every blissful pure land. All the immortals, perfected beings, divine sages, and holy assemblies behold this great radiance and gather like clouds in assembly. The clouds converge in an instant, filling the sky, their origin unknown. The holy hosts swiftly gather like clouds, hence called \"cloud assembly.\" The light descends to illumine the boundless worlds below, all of which become as the Pure Subtlety Heaven’s Mystic Capital, closely linked in spirit to the Nine Celestial Upper Heavens. Within the light, a divine breeze plays celestial melodies, harmonizing as palace modes and shang tones blend. Though the five notes—palace, shang, and the rest—distinguish clarity and turbidity and correspond to the Five Phases, their natural wonder is not easily matched. The Emperor’s divine breeze harmonizes exquisitely of itself, far surpassing mortal music. As palace and shang tones resonate, they stir and resound through the cloud courts, transforming into the precious chapters of the Three Caverns. All beings in the worlds below universally attain the mysterious transformation of the Great Dao.\n\nIn the Fengdu prisons, the Iron-Walled Citadel, the eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms, and all the hells, suffering beings look up to receive the power of the Jade Emperor’s great illuminating Dharma. They are all reborn in the heavenly palaces, where they enjoy bliss. Today, the celestial treasures and wondrous flowers I have scattered swirl and weave into a floral canopy, universally covering and sheltering all assembled at this Dharma feast. All look up to receive the majestic power and divine virtue of the Heavenly Worthy Jade Emperor.\n\nWe, the Lords of the Pure Clarity Heaven, are not merely fortunate in this single lifetime to encounter such a rarity. Through countless kalpas, we have cultivated good causes, and now we meet the auspicious convergence of the Nine Heavens, where the imperial Dao of Heaven flows vast and level, and the profound and wondrous true Dharma flourishes in full splendor.\n\nOne version states: When the Primordial Beginning initiated transformation and expounded the supreme Dharma, the imperial wind was profound and serene, the Great Dao level and even. At that time, no heterodox paths existed, and the true Dharma flourished in its prime. This meaning is also acceptable.\n\nToday’s celebration in the celestial realm is a most auspicious occasion. All divine beings and every living creature universally receive and rely upon the most mysterious transformative power.\n\nAnother version states: All desire to look up in hope of the mysterious power and humbly present the essentials of the Dao. This is also acceptable.\n\nIn my humble opinion: Though the human body is small, it encompasses Heaven and Earth, contains the myriad existences, and embraces all wonders. The pure, empty, and numinous qi governs the six yang, and there is also the Lord of the High, Empty, Pure Clarity Heaven. If the primordial spirit loses its governance and the mysterious transformation does not manifest, one is drawn into the waves of affection, sunk in the sea of suffering. The vast currents and towering waves surge without end—how can one avoid drowning and rescue those lost in darkness?\n\nWhen even one person is steeped in delusion, they sink and drag others down with them, leading both astray—a matter not worth discussing. Those who stagnate in the Lesser Vehicle or are deluded by side paths, like flowing water without a source, cannot escape drying up—this, too, is not worth mentioning. Occasionally, one dredges the wellspring of the numinous and connects with the pulse of the Dao, gradually nearing transformation. Yet if one hoards their own richness and fails to let virtue descend, this is not the great accomplishment.\n\nThus, some attain the fruits of the Four Brahmā or Six Desire Heavens but do not reach the Nine Celestial or Seven Treasures realms. Some receive blessings among humans, or become lords of hells or demon kings. Some even sink into the Three Evil Paths or are lost in the Nine Dark Realms—what sorrow could be greater? When the numinous transformation is not manifest and the wondrous resonance is not revealed, the true scriptures fail to circulate. The jade-like flowers lose their luster because one has not cultivated good causes or believed in the true Dharma. Thus, one cannot hear the vast and level Dao or look up to receive the mysterious power.\n\nIf one can concentrate the mysterious spirit, stabilize the Heavenly Lord, and embody the pure, empty, and wondrously numinous, then when the later mechanism is activated, one will penetrate the Cao Creek, drink the entire Western River, merge with the golden liquid, and ascend the shore of the Dao. The sea of suffering and the pit of karma will be forever extinguished. One will transcend the Six Desires, rise above the Four Brahmā, universally unite with the myriad spirits, and illumine the dark realms. The divine breeze stirs the true, the wondrous resonance is peerless, and the true scriptures silently circulate without cease. The myriad existences receive boundless grace. Fengdu’s walls are breached, the Nine Dark Realms are illuminated, hells transform into heavens, and sinful beings become pure lands. The yin turbidity of the body entirely shifts to yang clarity; jade-like flowers radiate rosy hues, sheltering all wonders. This is truly the numinous power of the August Emperor and the force of the primordial spirit. Without accumulating cultivation and nurturing the true Dharma with unwavering faith, how could one hear the auspicious wind of the imperial Dao or look up to receive the mysterious power?\n\nAlas! The wondrous truth of this body is revealed when we, the Lords of the Pure Clarity Heaven, arrive late at the Dharma feast and celebrate the encounter with the Dharma Bridge. To praise the sagely transformation and extol the mysterious power is to say that the Dao universally saves the dark and the manifest alike. Yet to cultivate good causes, broaden wondrous practices, not seek hasty transformation, and let the wondrous root arise naturally—this is the secret of attaining sagely perfection. Those who study the Dao should savor this and realize it for themselves.\n\n**Chapter on Spiritual Penetrations, Verse 27**\n\nAt this time, as the holy assembly all look up to receive the mysterious power, the Lord of the High, Empty, Pure Clarity Heaven—explained previously—praises the Jade Emperor in verse:\n\nThe Lord of the Pure Clarity Heaven praises the Jade Emperor in verse:\n\nGolden Portal, Mystic Vault Ancestor,\n*(Ancestor: One version reads \"Lord.\" Considering the scripture’s meaning, the Jade Emperor is the Lord of Heaven, teacher of all buddhas, and ruler of the Golden Portal, the venerable elder of the Mystic Capital’s vaulted heavens, hence called \"Ancestor.\" If rendered as \"Lord,\" it refers only to the Heavenly Emperor.)*\n\nSupreme Jade Emperor Worthy,\n*(Explained previously.)*\n\nWondrous form crowns all heavens,\n*(All divine beings in the heavens possess fine forms, but some may decline or be limited in their transformations. Each resides in their own heaven and cannot assume all forms; their appearances and countenances are not supremely transcendent. The Jade Emperor’s form is wondrously excellent without limit, his appearance and countenance uniquely surpassing all heavens.)*\n\nCompassionate light illumines the Three Realms.\n*(His great compassionate radiance illumines the heavens above, the earth below, and the human realm in between, hence called \"universally illumines the Three Realms.\")*\n\nTrue Sage, Wondrous Dao’s Master.\n\nOne tradition states: The Jade Emperor’s conduct is truly sagely and mystically wondrous—he is the revered master of the Dao’s lineage. Heavenly and mortal beings rely upon this master. The Jade Emperor serves as the teaching lord of heaven and humanity, sovereign of all spirits, and supreme divine sage of the heavens. All people in the world revere and depend upon him, drawing upon his transformative power; thus, he is the teacher of heaven and humanity.\n\nHe expounds the Great Vehicle’s teachings,\n*(The Dao’s teachings are divided into three vehicles: upper, middle, and lower. There is also a supreme vehicle, which transcends all ranks, surpassing the three grades and encompassing all without omission—this is the Great Vehicle. The teachings of various spirits follow their own wisdom and insight; the Great Vehicle is rarely heard. The Jade Emperor’s dispensation of the Dao clarifies and reveals the true essence, penetrating from highest to lowest, encompassing all grades. All beings who receive his instruction attain liberation—this is the Great Vehicle’s expounding of the Dharma.)*\n\nHe points out the true One to those lost on the path.\n*(The Jade Emperor employs the true essence and the mystic principle of the One to illuminate and awaken those who have strayed, offering direct transmission without deviation, preventing them from falling into lesser or misguided teachings. It is like pointing someone toward the main road, ensuring they do not stray onto crooked paths.)*\n\nHis virtue and power are like the emptiness of space.\n*(All things in the world have limits and come to an end. Only the emptiness of space remains unchanged through kalpas, never altering. The Jade Emperor’s vast merit and supreme virtue are boundless, like the emptiness of space, impossible to fathom. While other divine sages possess merit and virtue, whether great or small, near or distant, they may be compared within their own measure. The Jade Emperor’s virtue and power defy comparison—thus, they are like the emptiness of space.)*\n\nHis praises are inexhaustible.\n*(The Jade Emperor’s virtue and power are like the emptiness of space; his praises cannot be fully expressed, and devotion to him knows no end. His praises are boundless, and his sublime power cannot be named. As Huang Shigong said: Though the Lord of the High Void and Pure Clarity later attended the Dharma assembly, upon truly witnessing the Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformations and divine splendor, he was filled with endless admiration. Thus, he composed sublime verses to extol the Jade Emperor. In ancient times, Zai Wo, Zigong, and You Ruo excelled in praising and revering Confucius, for their wisdom was sufficient to recognize a sage. Now, the Lord of Pure Clarity praises the Jade Emperor’s virtue and power as boundless as the emptiness of space, his praises inexhaustible—no other eulogy has been so thorough and complete. This is akin to the wisdom of Zai Wo, Zigong, and You Ruo in recognizing Confucius. These verses may truly be called \"words of insight.\")\n\nMy humble observation: The primordial spirit of the human body remains unchanged through kalpas; the true master of the four limbs is the origin of all existence. It wondrously crowns the six yang, compassionately protects the three origins, and serves as the true teacher of the self, upon which the spirit and qi depend. Its numinous illumination shines brightly, its Dharma voice is supreme, directly shattering delusion and revealing the all-encompassing path. Its wondrous essence and mysterious power—wherever its virtue extends, it is equal to the emptiness of space. How could praises ever be exhausted? Yet people fail to turn inward and reflect, to comprehend this true essence. They do not recognize the supreme virtue within themselves, nor the Jade Emperor’s virtue and power—how then could they grasp the benefits of this scripture’s merit? No wonder they do not awaken to the true reality.\n\nThe Lord of Pure Clarity, gazing upon the Jade Emperor’s virtue and power, composed sublime verses in praise, not only to extol the blessings of heaven but also to instruct people to turn their light inward. If one can align with their original true nature, understand the power of the Dao, and emulate heaven’s impartiality, sharing the same merit as the Emperor, they will not be misled by other paths, nor lose their celestial treasure. Thus may they aspire to sagehood. Let those of resolve take heed.\n\n**Chapter on Spiritual Powers, Twenty-Eighth**\n\nHe is the Lord of the Vault of Heaven, honored through kalpas without end. His wondrous vision and wondrous knowledge are peerless and unmatched. Profoundly still and truly pure, he is neither gone nor present, yet both gone and present. Supreme sage, supreme spirit, great in spiritual power, repository of radiance, mighty hero—he enlightens humans and heavens, teaching without end. Vast in compassion, vast in mercy, he turns the wheel of the Dharma, delivering all beings. Thus is he named the Jade Emperor, the true elder of the vault of heaven, wondrously perfect, pure, and serene. His wisdom and eloquence, his Dao and his honor, are supreme. To liberate all beings, he emits this light.\n\nAt that time, the Lord of the High Void and Pure Clarity, having spoken his verses in praise, sat in silent meditation.\n\nWei Boyang said: The Lord of the High Void and Pure Clarity, in extolling the Jade Emperor’s virtue and power, not only composed ten verses of praise but also declared: This Jade Emperor is the sagely lord of the vaulted and boundless heavens, the supreme honor through kalpas without measure. *(Ordinary kalpas have numbers—whether hundreds of millions or trillions—but none can be called \"vast.\" The Jade Emperor has served as the teaching lord of the ten thousand heavens through kalpas beyond count, vast and profound, impossible to fathom. Hence, he is called \"honored through kalpas without end.\")* His far-reaching illumination leaves nothing unlit; his spiritual powers and wondrous vision penetrate all without obstruction. His great awakening and mystic knowledge have no equal, no peer for comparison. Radiant and translucent, profoundly still, majestic and unshaken, he is without duality, without cessation. His Dao is utterly true; his virtue utterly pure, unstained and unsullied.\n\nVast as if gone—yet not truly gone, for it is the natural state of emptiness. Vast as if present—yet not clinging to presence, for it is the wondrous existence of non-attachment. Whether vast as gone or vast as present, it cannot be clearly seen or measured. All immortals, buddhas, and spirits revere the Jade Emperor as the most supreme among sages. Among all divine beings, none possess spiritual powers like his. He is the most exalted and mysterious spirit, his transformations sixfold and transcendent, surpassing all. Truly, his great spiritual power illumines eternally, his radiance pure and undimmed, ever emerging, never extinguished or obscured. He is the true repository of radiance, containing boundless great light.\n\nNone is more honored than the Dao. The Jade Emperor embodies the Dao’s spontaneity, vast beyond measure, without limit. Rightly is he called the mighty hero. *(Worldly worthies perfect body and nature, rectify themselves and others, and encompass heaven and earth—this is the mighty hero. The Jade Emperor transforms heaven and earth, gives rise to people and things, without beginning or end. Among sages, he is the most honored; among spirits, the greatest. What hero could surpass him?)* He enlightens and transforms all humans and heavens, teaching and guiding the Dao without end. He covers and loves all existence, pitying and mindful of all beings, without limit.\n\nGreat in faith, vast in compassion, he turns the radiant Dharma-wheel, ensuring it neither stagnates nor conceals. *(The character \"fades\" (焕) might also be rendered as \"turns,\" but this would be overly restrictive.)* To transform and deliver all beings, he is thus titled the Jade Emperor.\n\nThe true primordial elder of the vaulted heavens, most venerable, wondrously all-pervasive and perfectly attuned—truly pure, truly pristine—possessing boundless wisdom and infinite discernment, his subtle eloquence inexhaustible, his talents ever-flowing, his supreme Dao immeasurable, his honor unmatched. Now, to enlighten and uplift all beings, he radiates this great compassionate light, universally illuminating.\n\nAt that moment, the Lord of the High Void and Luminous Heavens spoke this gāthā in praise, then fell silent and resumed his seat.\n\n*(My humble note: The primordial spirit within the human body is none other than the Jade Emperor of the heavens, known as the Primordial Sovereign, the True Lord, the Mysterious Origin, the Ancestral Perfected, the Celestial Monarch, the Nature School, the True Ancestral Origin, the Dharma-nature, the Wondrous Luminous True Mind, the Right Nature, the Mysterious Numinous, the True Master, the Mysterious Radiance, the Great Pillar, the Dharma King, the Wondrous Treasure, the True Root, the Buddha-nature, the True Seed, and the Cinnabar Primordial.)*\n\nThe true lord of the body, uniquely wondrous and peerless, holds infinite luminous potential, transforming yin and yang, his divine wisdom unfathomable. Compassionate toward all subtleties, his responses are all-encompassing and luminously attuned. Most honored and most noble, his transformative power knows no end. Silently merging essence and qi, he nurtures the true numinous. Thus, the true light reveals itself at times, and the wondrous mechanism perpetually arises. Those who embody this naturally give birth to the divine infant, sharing the Jade Emperor’s merit and virtue, their Dao-transformations endless.\n\nOnly when one truly grasps the gāthā of the Lord of the Luminous Heavens in praise of the Emperor does genuine knowledge and realization arise. Otherwise, the true mystery remains unattained, and the Emperor’s transformations go unrecognized. The verses of the Luminous Gāthā, when recited, may seem like a dream—how then can one attain the merit of the scripture or reap its true benefits?\n\nAlas! The nature of the Dao resides within us, its true mystery self-sufficient. To comprehend the wondrous luminous true mechanism is to truly respond to and extol the Jade Emperor’s glorious radiance.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Divine Powers**\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies, saying: This Emperor’s body is the Dao-body, no ordinary form. It is the body of boundless merit and virtue, the body of true purity and spontaneity, the indestructible true emptiness of divine luminosity, the supreme Dharma-body.\n\nHis majestic spirit vast and expansive, his renown all-pervading, no darkness escapes his illumination. His divine subtlety towering and sublime, beyond all description.\n\nThe Barefoot Great Immortal said: After the Lord of the Luminous Heavens recited the gāthā in praise of the Jade Emperor, he resumed his seat in silence.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning again addressed the four assemblies at the Dharma assembly, saying: This wondrous transformative body of the Jade Emperor is the great Dao-body, no ordinary form.\n\nThe Dao is originally formless—how then can one speak of a \"body\"? Though the Dao is void and boundless, infinite and inexhaustible, it transforms the ten thousand things, completes beginnings and ends, animates yin and yang without cease. Truly empty yet possessing substance, it is not mere nothingness. The Jade Emperor’s merit and virtue are like the vastness of empty space, his spirit one with the Dao. Thus it is said: the Emperor’s body is the Dao-body, no ordinary form.\n\nIt is the body of inexhaustible great merit and virtue, the body of true purity, true clarity, and spontaneity, unbound. Merit has limits, virtue may be exhausted—how can one speak of boundlessness? The Jade Emperor transforms all worlds, unchanged since time immemorial—how could he be limited?\n\nTo be attached to form or constrained by appearances is not true purity or spontaneity. The Jade Emperor, forever free from defilement, attains great freedom—is this not spontaneity?\n\nIt is the body of divine luminosity, firm and enduring, the indestructible true emptiness, the supreme and incomparable wondrous Dharma-body. All things in the world possessing form are subject to decay—only emptiness endures. That which decays is neither firm nor divine. Since the great void abides, emptiness is the ultimate truth.\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s divine power persists through the ages undiminished, his mysterious radiance endures through kalpas unvanquished. Not only is he supremely divine and luminous, but his firmness is unassailable, his solidity unbreakable, forever immune to destruction or decay. It is the ever-abiding true emptiness, the indestructible wondrous body, the supreme and peerless Dharma-body.\n\nWho could easily fathom his majestic virtue and divine radiance? Vast and boundless, expansive beyond measure, his inconceivable names and titles overflow, pervading the ten directions. His light reaches every mote of dust, no darkness escapes his illumination. His divine powers and mysteries towering and immeasurable, vast and indescribable—how could one ever fully extol them?\n\n*(My humble note: The human nature is inherently luminous and divinely subtle, self-so. With the three bodies complete and the four wisdoms perfected, the vast qi of integrity, the essence of true unity, the myriad virtues and wondrous qualities—what is lacking? Yet in this fleeting body, one bears the responsibilities of the three realms, with no respite. It is no ordinary form, but the Dao-body, the body of boundless merit and virtue, the body of true purity and spontaneity, the indestructible true emptiness of divine luminosity, the supreme Dharma-body. How then do worldly people indulge themselves, squandering this body, their minds burdened and spirits scattered, essence depleted and qi dispersed, their nature and Dao obscured? Who attends to the mandate of destiny? The essentials of the Dao remain elusive. The illusory body vanishes in emptiness, this life passes in vain, existence and extinction like a dream—utterly unaware. How then can one attain transformation?)*\n\nSome may possess luminous virtue and fulfill their nature, yet fail to preserve their attainment to the end. Thus, people cannot exhaust the divine and attain transformation, return to emptiness and become immortals, or merge with the Dao as one.\n\nOnly the Jade Emperor, whose body is the Dao, whose merit and virtue are boundless, whose purity and spontaneity are innate, whose divine luminosity is firm and indestructible, whose true emptiness is unassailable, and whose Dharma-body is supreme—his name remains imperishable.\n\nFor those newly entering the sagely stream, even a single gap remains unbridged. Gazing upon him, they cannot penetrate his mystery; speaking of him, they fail to awaken. Their minds have not yet grasped the workings of nature and destiny, nor do they understand the divine source of the divine. Their learning has not yet unified heaven and humanity, nor do they comprehend the transformative power of transformation. They resign themselves to the unfathomability of the heavenly Dao, yearning to encounter the transcendent sages who have attained the profound.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning took pity on sentient beings’ prolonged delusion and extolled the Emperor’s virtue as vast and far-reaching, fully awakening those deaf and blind through kalpas past to witness the wondrous efficacy of divine transformation. In true great compassion and profound benevolence, he desired all beings to enter the sublime, expanding his majestic numen and pervading his renown, illuminating the hidden and subtle, divine and wondrous, towering and boundless—his virtue defying all names. Such is the Heavenly Worthy’s great vow.\n\nYet the world drifts and founders, human hearts sink and drown, unable to follow the Emperor’s principles or uphold the Primordial Beginning’s teachings. Alas! Heaven and humanity share one principle, sage and mortal share one heart—failing to emulate the sage and aspire to heaven, the Dao’s law is natural, and one truly falls short before the true scriptures, the great Dao, parents, and the body of life. Such is the plight of those with resolve.\n\nThe thirty chapters on *Divine Transformations* declare: This Emperor is not one whose merit arises from cultivated deeds. Though in the past he descended to be born among humans, traversing many kalpas to enact transformation, demonstrating great divine transformations, his body remained pure and undefiled. Never did he cease residing in the Golden Palace, manifesting in myriad forms, responding to all directions, aiding and delivering sentient beings, elevating them to the Dao’s shore, universally bestowing teachings, awakening later generations. Those who follow and uphold his teachings ascend to truth and attain the Dao. Through such merit and virtue, his adornment is such that his radiance perpetually fills all heavens, his divine wisdom wondrously penetrating, beyond all measure.\n\nThe Perfected of Wondrous Conduct said: This towering, divinely wondrous Jade Emperor, whose virtues defy full enumeration, does not rely on contrived deeds or forced merit for cultivation and realization. In kalpas past, though he descended to be born among humans, traversing many kalpas to broadly enact teachings and display great divine transformations—renouncing kingship to cultivate the Dao, severing love to study the Way, administering medicines to heal illness, expounding the Dao to propagate transformation, enduring insult with joyful renunciation, attaining the rank of Golden Immortal, teaching and delivering bodhisattvas through kalpas—thus do the Buddhist scriptures record the causes of buddhas’ births, speaking of descending from Tuṣita Heaven upon a fragrant elephant into the womb of Queen Māyā, whence the Buddha of Literature was born. This, too, is but one manifestation of the Jade Emperor’s teachings, adapted to circumstances.\n\nElsewhere, he attended the Assembly of Floating Radiance, the Assembly of the Jeweled Pearl, assuming the forms of commoners and Daoists, wherever he encountered the numinous, universally delivering without cease. As Lord of all Heavenly Worthies, his divine transformations are immeasurable. Through many kalpas of enacting transformation and displaying great divine transformations, his Dharma-body remained pure and undefiled, towering and unshaken, never absent from the Golden Palace of Yellow and Gold.\n\nWhen the Primordial Beginning was about to expound the *Jade Scripture*, the Emperor emitted a great light, instantly dividing his body to pervade the great heavenly palaces of the ten directions. In every world—above in heaven, below on earth, among humans—all beheld the radiance, each receiving benefit and joy, together hearing the Great Vehicle. Such was his division of body, transformation, and response to all directions, aiding and delivering sentient beings, elevating them to the Dao’s shore. The merit thus accrued was not confined to one time or place but universally bestowed teachings, opening and awakening later generations. Those who reverently follow the scriptures and honor the Emperor’s command may ascend to the rank of highest perfected and fulfill the great Dao.\n\nThe Emperor’s adornment with this supreme, wondrous merit is why his emitted radiance perpetually fills all heavens, his divine and great wisdom spiritually wondrous and penetrating, beyond all measurement and reckoning. His divine wisdom wondrously penetrating, his great radiance is no mere transient light—his virtue flourishes, and his light is wondrous. Beyond all measure, his divine wisdom wondrously penetrating is no fleeting attainment—his Dao is wondrous, and his divinity manifest. Thus is it ever clearer that the Emperor’s merit does not rely on cultivated deeds.\n\nThis fool observes: The primordial spirit of humans endures through kalpas unchanged; its great divine radiance and wondrousness defy easy description. How could it be achieved through intentional action? In hearing and seeing, awareness and knowing, movement and stillness, sitting and lying, eating and resting, speech and silence, responding to stimuli and reciprocating—though manifesting wondrously according to conditions, the pure original substance never departs the cinnabar palace, instantly congealing the mysterious and wondrous to produce the divine infant, while the true and real remains ever unseparated. In a hundred billion transformations, aiding and delivering according to direction, guiding beings to the Dao’s shore, broadly proclaiming the numinous essence, enlightening those of later times—guarding the secret and upholding the true, transcending the mortal and attaining the sage, all transformations reach fulfillment, no fruit left unripened. Through such wondrous conduct as adornment, a single gleam of mysterious radiance pervades all without obstruction, the marvelous efficacy of nature and Dao defying all measurement and reckoning. Behold the Jade Emperor’s sagely virtue and divine efficacy, untainted by contrivance and beyond all measure—are they not of one accord?\n\nThough the nature of inherent perfection is shared, the reckless and abandoned are many, allowing their pure and upright nature to be obscured by lust and delusion, like a bright mirror buried in dust, its radiance unseen. Thus beauty and ugliness remain hidden, and the wondrous intent unmanifest. Yet if one scrapes away the grime and polishes the light, renewing day by day and growing month by month, responding without intention, the true and real is naturally at ease. The Golden Palace and Purple Mansion eternally house the primordial spirit, constantly responding yet constantly still, undisturbed in the least. In wondrous discernment, the one pervades the myriad; in manifest conduct, it responds without attachment. In great compassion and vast vows, it never regresses; in myriad wondrous adornments, it defies enumeration. Through boundless cultivation, true radiance naturally pervades—his merit and virtue are inconceivable.\n\nAlas! This Dao is inherently possessed by humans, neither reliant on cultivated deeds nor attainable through stubborn emptiness, neither existent nor nonexistent. Those of discernment embody it.\n\nThe thirty-first chapter on *Divine Transformations* states: The radiance of this body bears wondrous names. They are called: Great Divine Transformation Light, Great Compassion Light, Great Joyful Renunciation Light, Great Forbearance Light, Great Equanimity Light, Great Gentleness Light, Great Freedom Light, Great Benefit Light, Great Wish-Fulfilling Light, Great Wisdom Light, Great Auspiciousness Light, Great Liberation Light, Great Refuge Light, Great Merit Light, Great Perfection Light, Great Unobstructed Light, and Invincible Light.\n\nThe Perfected of Great Wisdom said: The great radiance emitted by the Jade Emperor’s body bears these supreme and wondrous names.\n\nWhat are these radiant names? They refer to the seventeen great lights, beginning with Great Divine Transformation Light. The Jade Emperor universally bestows illumination and embrace; through wondrous practices and accumulated realizations, he possesses great numinous power and is endowed with the six divine penetrations. His Divine Transformation Light adorns and illumines all things—this is the first of the radiant names.\n\nNext, the Emperor embodies great compassion, great mercy; his boundless compassion and mercy manifest in wondrous, vast radiance. Great Compassion Light is the second.\n\nFurther, the Emperor truly embodies joyful renunciation; his boundless joy and renunciation shine with wondrous, universal brightness. Great Joyful Renunciation Light is the third.\n\nThrough kalpas uncounted, the Emperor has cultivated great forbearance; his limitless forbearance emits an unstoppable radiance. Great Forbearance Light is the fourth.\n\nIn former cultivations, the Emperor practiced great equanimity; his ceaseless equanimity shines with an irresistible light. Great Equanimity Light is the fifth.\n\nIn past kalpas, the Emperor also embodied great gentleness; his tender harmony remains unchanged through vast eons, universally manifesting an inexhaustible radiance. Great Gentleness Light is the sixth.\n\nThe Emperor’s virtue is tranquil and serene, transcendent and free; his expansive, luminous radiance knows no end. Great Freedom Light is the seventh.\n\nThe Emperor’s benevolence is vast and boundless, eternally benefiting all; his unceasing beneficence shines with dharma-splendor. Great Benefit Light is the eighth.\n\nThe Emperor’s universal body has realized wondrous awakening; pure and spontaneous, he is the Dharma King, the Tathāgata. After countless kalpas, he attained the imperial throne, his supreme merit transcending thought, his numinous transformations perfectly responsive. His Wish-Fulfilling Light endures without limit. Great Wish-Fulfilling Light is the ninth.\n\nThe Emperor possesses great wisdom, great discernment; his wisdom surpasses all, his radiance peerless. Great Wisdom Light is the tenth.\n\nThe Emperor is fundamentally perfectly good, eternally supremely auspicious; his radiance shines ceaselessly. Great Auspiciousness Light is the eleventh.\n\nThe Emperor, having long awakened, attained great liberation; spontaneously released, his golden light shines forever. Great Liberation Light is the twelfth.\n\nThe Emperor is one with the great Dao, the wondrous dharma spontaneous; through endless kalpas, his true faith never wavers. All in the ten directions and future ages eternally revere and uphold him, turning their spirits to the Dao, their radiance ever bright and undimmed. Great Refuge Light is the thirteenth.\n\nThe Emperor universally delivers boundless beings, perfectly accomplishing all without omission; his merit is supreme, his radiance ever resplendent. Great Merit Light is the fourteenth.\n\nWith merit perfected and the Dao complete, the Emperor’s virtue is perfectly fulfilled; his universal light shines eternally, signifying his accomplishment. Great Perfection Light is the fifteenth.\n\nFrom dust and defilement long purified, his wondrous penetration is perfectly luminous; his numinous transformations unobstructed, the Emperor’s light shines forever. Great Unobstructed Light is the sixteenth.\n\nNoblest among spirits, most revered among sages, Lord of the Myriad Heavens, Teacher of all Buddhas—throughout the vast kalpas and dharma realms, none surpass the Jade Emperor. Thus, his radiance perpetually fills all realms, his numinous transformations immeasurable. Invincible Light—is this not the seventeenth of the great lights?\n\nThese seventeen great lights, with their wondrous and numinous meanings, are now manifested by the Jade Emperor—how could his divine transformations be measured?\n\nThis humble observer notes: In the realm of human existence, the cultivation of true nature is paramount. Thus, the *Biographies of Immortals* regard this as the seed of great radiance. Though the true seed is fully possessed, none preserve it; thus, in the realm of delusion, one must undertake the work of purification. Therefore, to each supreme good cause corresponds a wondrous, divine light. The Jade Emperor’s accumulated cultivation is immeasurable, his wondrous practices inexhaustible—why only seventeen great lights? For the faculties of beings are many and difficult to awaken, and the transformations of the Dao are profound. The Emperor’s seventeen lights are like the Buddha manifesting his thirty-two-foot form while emitting great auspicious light from his crown. Moreover, the Emperor’s light is supremely wondrous, transcending all comparison—who could trace his wondrous practices or comprehend the seventeen great meanings? Alas, this is difficult to attain, yet it may be hoped for. The Dao resides within oneself: negligence dims it, diligence brightens it. Cultivate effortless practice without seeking swift transformation, and the Dao will naturally be attained.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Divine Transformations**\n\nThus, those among you who desire to behold the Emperor yet cannot do so are hindered because you remain attached to body and speech, unable to relinquish habitual tendencies, afflictive actions, and karmic deeds. Due to these obstructions, you cannot gaze upon the Emperor’s compassionate countenance. I shall now proclaim for this assembly the method to sever these hindrances; all of you should each uphold and practice it.\n\nAt that time, the great assembly was overcome with joy, each bowing their heads before the Most Revered, desiring to hear the teaching.\n\nMaster Lei, the Radiant Elder, said: The Jade Emperor emits seventeen great lights, his divine transformations immeasurable. Thus, even the Heavenly Lords of the Lofty Void and Pure Brightness, though desiring to truly behold the Jade Emperor, cannot do so. The reason is this: though you are free from dust and defilement, having realized the station of Heavenly Emperor, the supreme Mahāyāna has not been fully penetrated. You remain attached to body and speech, unable to relinquish the habitual tendencies of countless kalpas—ignorance, afflictions, and the transgressions of mundane actions. Due to these obstructions, you cannot behold the Jade Emperor’s compassionate countenance.\n\nHabitual tendencies arise from worldly desires and defilements. All delusive entanglements must not be coveted; yet, due to insufficient wisdom and excessive attachment, thoughts arise, gradually leading to contamination. Entangled by external objects, the bonds deepen, forming toxic habits like ropes tightly knotted, difficult to untie in an instant. Long-ingrained defilements are not easily removed; the roots of evil karma remain unpurified. Habitual tendencies toward worldly desires may accumulate afflictions, transgressive actions, or karmic conditions—endless distractions, unceasing disturbances, and the burdens of past deeds obscure and obstruct. Though you now govern the Brahmā heavens, your realization remains incomplete, the profound mystery not fully grasped. How then could you behold the Most Supreme? Thus, you cannot immediately see the Jade Emperor.\n\nHere now do I, for this assembly of disciples, clearly expound and reveal the method to sever and dissolve all obstructions. Let each among you uphold and practice it with utmost devotion.\n\nAt that moment, the great assembly overflowed with joy and exultation, each prostrating before the Jade Table of the Primordial Beginning, bowing their heads in reverence, eager to hear the esoteric discourse on severing obstructions.\n\nI—this is the self-designation of the Primordial Beginning. *Table*—a desk or stand.\n\nI observe: since birth, each person carries karmic conditions from former lives. Though the kalpas renew and the qi of Great Harmony prevails, the cultivation of past eons is not easily forgotten at once. Thus, the scriptures compare the latent karmic affinities to accumulated toxins—truly an insightful analogy. Those bound by auspicious affinities may meet as kindred spirits across distant lands, while those entangled in malevolent affinities may remain as strangers though face-to-face. Do not dismiss the records of the *Daoist Canon* or the annals of Buddhist teachings as heterodox doctrines; even within Confucian texts, Yan Ying’s opposition to Confucius was attributed to fate, and the great scholars Cheng and Su were divided into the factions of Shu and Luo—such too is the misfortune of ill-matched affinities. Yet those who ought to be close may grow distant over time, a lament shared across ages. How then can the doctrine of karmic conditions be entirely abandoned?\n\nThus, the ten perceptions are not easily exhausted, the five aggregates not easily fathomed. The thirteen kinds of disciples, the twenty-five demonic seeds, the seven illusions and three unions—all these mechanisms and snares, who can easily escape? The Lord of the Pure Bright Heaven, though enthroned as a supreme deity and freed from worldly defilements, has not yet transcended the accumulated karma of countless kalpas, lingering in the lofty void, styled the Pure and Bright. Past virtuous causes have not yet shed the trappings of emptiness. How then could one such as the Jade Emperor, who embodies the wondrous existence of empty luminosity, be readily perceived?\n\nIn examining the sutras and the bodhisattva path, even those who beheld the face of Śākyamuni Tathāgata did not truly see him. When the Buddha of Measureless Light expounded the supreme truth, the bodhisattvas listened in silence—such is the meaning here. How easily can the Most Sagely be seen? How easily can the obstructions of bodily and verbal habits be dissolved?\n\nYet this principle is most difficult to perceive: to *see* the Emperor is not to see with the eyes; to fully comprehend the Emperor’s conduct is to thoroughly align with his virtue. As among Confucius’ disciples, only those who truly received the Master’s transmission of the heart-mind attained the one mechanism. When the heart is sincere, though times and worlds differ, the principle remains the same. Only through spiritual communion and heart-mind resonance is true vision attained. Even the wise Yan Hui fell short by a single degree; how then should the Lord of the Pure Bright Heaven, unable to behold the Jade Emperor, be doubted?\n\nThe method of the Primordial Beginning to sever the demonic array is to illumine past deeds, verify the heart’s essence, and dissolve all barriers. Once inner obstructions are melted away, what external hindrance remains? Then the Jade Emperor may be seen. Thus, the assembly yearned to hear these teachings.\n\nAlas! The arising of obstructions and the breaking of demonic arrays—all proceed from the mind. With great penetration and unimpeded freedom, one’s original spirit responds without negligence. The coarse traces of speech and hearing must not become stagnant obstructions. Is not the Great Dao within me? Strive on!\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Divine Penetrations**\nThe Heavenly Worthy spoke:\nThe method to sever obstructions is to generate great wisdom. Do not arouse doubt, do not arouse greed or anger, do not arouse sensual desire, do not arouse jealousy, do not arouse killing or harm, do not arouse mundane emotions, do not arouse mundane thoughts, do not arouse dullness or defilement, do not arouse sound or form, do not arouse right or wrong, do not arouse love or hatred, do not arouse discrimination, do not arouse arrogance, do not arouse attachment.\n\nGuangchengzi said: When the assembly of the pure requested the Primordial Heavenly Worthy to expound the wondrous principle of obstruction-free vision, he declared: To sever obstructions and behold the wondrous transformation and radiant countenance of the Jade Emperor, there is no other way—one must generate the divine wisdom of the spirit-mind, firmly believe in the true Dao, and not arouse the heart of doubt, duality, or confusion.\n\nThe Great Dao is utterly correct, the True One without duality—there is fundamentally nothing to doubt. Yet when clarity is insufficient to perceive the subtleties, one wavers between two extremes, lacking steadfast vision, and demonic knowledge infiltrates. Once you know the Great Dao resides within you, guard this knowing with firmness. Do not divide it into two, do not multiply it into three—what then is there to doubt? Without doubt, there is no confusion, and the Dao may be entered.\n\nThus, the great wisdom that severs obstructions and dissolves ingrained habits must first be free of doubt. Seekers of the Dao must not calculate merit, nor seek it elsewhere. Anger, resentment, indignation, and discontent—none of these may arise.\n\nNext in severing obstructions: do not arouse greed or anger. With the heart focused on the Dao, its center remains naturally pure. Nurturing private desires and indulging in excess easily gives rise to deluded thoughts; even the slightest inclination toward sensual indulgence or craving greatly disrupts the truth.\n\nThird in severing obstructions: do not arouse sensual desire. The Dao embraces all without exception; the worthy and the unworthy alike are my teachers and friends. Even the slightest envy of the worthy or disdain for the mediocre is a grave error.\n\nFourth in severing obstructions: do not arouse jealousy. The Great Dao is supremely benevolent, not tolerating even the slightest harm. If, due to adversity or malice, one harbors thoughts of eradication, this is a grave departure from the Dao.\n\nFifth in severing obstructions: do not arouse killing or harm. Though the *Yinfu Jing* speaks of the mechanism of killing, it refers only to the ability to subdue and restrain demonic forces, whereby true freedom is attained. As in autumn’s solemn withering, when grasses and trees return to their roots, life’s mechanism withdraws—here lies the benevolence of Heaven and Earth, not the killing of the mundane world. It is also said: “Blessing arises from harm.” This too reveals the intent of Heaven and Earth, not the harm of the mundane world.\n\nSixth in severing obstructions: do not arouse mundane emotions. The Great Dao is without action; worldly perceptions and knowledge are not employed. The slightest activation of mundane intent leads to endless error.\n\nSeventh in severing obstructions: do not arouse mundane thoughts. The mechanism of the Great Dao requires all thoughts to be purified. The slightest trace of worldly thinking brings boundless harm.\n\nEighth in severing obstructions: do not arouse dullness or defilement. The Dao is fundamentally pure and luminous, free from contamination. The slightest touch of dullness or worldly filth loses one’s utmost truth.\n\nThe Dao is without sound or scent. To seek it through sound or form is to distance oneself from the Dao. Those who embody the Dao are not only unobstructed by external sounds and forms, untouched by worldly affairs, but also free from all traces and boundaries of the Dao—nothing is sought, nothing is grasped.\n\nNinth in severing obstructions: do not arouse sound or form. The Dao is fundamentally all-pervading unity. To cling to right or wrong is to lose the primordial truth of the Great Mystery.\n\nTenth in severing obstructions: do not arouse judgments of right and wrong. Though Mencius said, \"The sense of right and wrong is innate in all people,\" the profoundly wise appear foolish—why would they engage in such distinctions? The Dao makes no choices. To harbor love or aversion is to obstruct truth.\n\nEleventh in severing obstructions: regard all with equanimity, without arousing hatred or attachment. Principle is fundamentally undivided; to discriminate with cleverness is to depart from the Dao.\n\nTwelfth in severing obstructions: do not arouse discriminating thoughts. To see the Dao clearly is to rise above the dust of the world, disdaining worldly concerns. Yet to harbor arrogance even once is to greatly deviate from the Dao.\n\nThirteenth in severing obstructions: do not arouse thoughts of self-importance or disdain. The Great Dao is lively and free, utterly beyond attainment. Sever these thirteen obstructions, and the Dao is attained. Though called \"attaining the Dao,\" in truth there is nothing attained. The slightest grasping or attachment means principle’s obstruction remains unremoved, and one is bound by dharma.\n\nFourteenth and final in severing obstructions: do not arouse attachment. As this fool observes: the Dao within humans is inherently unobstructed. Only when the world’s affairs and principles obscure it does one lose the Dao. Thus, the Primordial Beginning in compassion revealed this chapter on severing obstructions to the pure assembly, enumerating each point to inspire resolve and unobstructed progress. Shedding the obstructions of worldly affairs and transcending the snares of dharma, one’s luminous countenance before the Jade Emperor will, with one’s wondrous clarity, shine forth in response—what then remains unseen?\n\nYet severing these two obstructions is but the gateway to the Dao. The profound awakening to divine transformation and the profound mystery shall be discussed later.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: Divine Powers**\nConcentrate the spirit and settle the thoughts; all spirits are subdued and harmonized. The mind becomes like the vast emptiness of heaven, inwardly and outwardly pure and unblemished, containing all without exclusion, embracing all without rejection. Let no external deviance disturb this supreme Dao, leading one astray from the true source, corrupting the numinous root, and stealing the supreme treasure. Thus, through countless kalpas, one remains forever mired in the mundane, entangled in the web of the worldly. Myriad demons assail, and for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, one hears not the wondrous dharma. Ghosts and spirits seize the chance to condemn, dragging one from life into death.\n\nTherefore, you must resolve with wholehearted sincerity to guard the true source and prevent its loss. As previously described, you must sever and eliminate all such obstructions. With the body purified, you transcend all difficulties—this is called the treasure of the Dao, the pillar upholding the dharma.\n\nLiu Haichan said: The Primordial Beginning’s teaching on severing obstructions generates great wisdom and cuts off the fourteen karmic tendencies. What is its ultimate aim? When obstructions are severed and obscurations removed, the spirit becomes clear and thoughts serene. One should silently abide in the primordial numinous origin, concentrate the original spirit, and settle all thoughts. All spirits harmonize and subside; the mind becomes like the boundless emptiness of the sky, inwardly and outwardly pure and steadfast. It contains and embraces all beings and phenomena in the dharma realm. With steadfast vision and unwavering resolve, one remains unchanging. Let no external deviance disturb the supreme and perfect Dao, leading one astray from the true and mysterious source, corrupting the wondrous numinous root, and stealing the indestructible and inalienable supreme treasure. Otherwise, through kalpas without end, one remains forever mired in the mundane, thoroughly entangled in the web of worldly dust. Myriad demons of the yin realms assail, and for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, one is deluded by demonic karma, never hearing the most supreme and wondrous dharma. Ghosts and spirits seize the chance to condemn, dragging one from the path of life into the realm of death.\n\nTherefore, all in this dharma assembly must focus with sincere resolve to guard and uphold the original true source, preventing its loss or abandonment. As previously described, you must sever and eliminate all doubts, delusions, and obstructions. The fourteen obstructions, external deviance, life and death—all such matters are encompassed herein. Having severed all obstructions, the body attains true purity, transcending and ascending beyond the three realms, escaping the karmic suffering, disasters, and hardships of cyclic existence. This method of severing obstructions is called the supreme treasure of the Dao, the great pillar upholding the true dharma. Without pillars, pavilions, pagodas, temples, halls, gates, and dwellings cannot be constructed. Without severing obstructions, one cannot complete the Dao, enter sagehood, or transcend the mundane. Severing obstructions prevents ultimate ruin and allows the true dharma to flourish. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy regards severing obstructions as the pillar upholding the dharma.\n\nAs this fool observes: the original spirit of human nature is inherently pure and undefiled, indestructible through countless kalpas. Fond of stillness and harmony, it is ever luminous, no different from the sages and perfected ones. If this luminosity persists without cease, how could the wondrous light of the Jade Emperor’s divine transformation not be personally witnessed? Yet thoughts entangle the mind, and habits persist unchanging. Few understand the Dao, and those who do often seek quick results. Thus, ingrained habits are hard to exhaust, afflictions difficult to relinquish, and the Emperor’s light remains unseen.\n\nOnly with true clarity, profound penetration, utmost vigor, and resolute decisiveness—recognizing the reality of nature and life, discerning the illusory nature of all phenomena—can one first see the Dao and forget things, then practice the Dao and forget people, then attain the Dao and forget the self, then perfect the Dao and forget the mind, then delight in the Dao and forget pursuits. Further, one forgets even the act of forgetting, merging principle and phenomena, transcending both truth and illusion, and no longer dwelling in the boundaries of sage or mundane. What need is there for the five ranks of host and guest? Attainment is no attainment; preservation is no preservation. Emptiness is not emptiness; the unspiritual is spiritual. Thus, past habits are purified, accumulated karma is severed, subtle defilements are extinguished, and one ascends to the supreme. Without need for silent audience before the Emperor, one shares the Emperor’s spirit. Without clinging to the Dao’s naturalness, one unites with the Dao’s truth. What place is there for the three vehicles, or the various ranks? Among sages, one is the most exalted, with unparalleled merit and virtue.\n\nAll can achieve this, but only when the roots and dust are purified, when effort is profound and practice wondrous, when there is non-action and no seeking.\n\nThose who feign attainment surely cannot transcend; when fusion remains incomplete and transformation lacks spiritual power, one’s entry into sagehood is still imperfect—such as earthbound immortals of the Daoist tradition, bodhisattvas of the Buddhist teachings, or the great worthies of the Confucian school. Now, those who seek the Dao must model themselves on the highest sages and not be content with the Great Vehicle alone.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Spiritual Powers**\nOne must further cultivate and revere this scripture, as though drawing near the Emperor, nurturing a heart of reverence and awe. Fix the mind upon the Emperor’s august countenance, extol his sacred name, and only then will you and all others behold his compassionate visage, receive his protection and deliverance, universally hear the wondrous Dharma, personally offer devotion and veneration, and forever escape the cycles of rebirth.\n\nThe Eastern Flower Lord of Wood declared: The Primordial Beginning revealed to the assembly the method for severing obstacles, proclaiming it the treasure of the Dao and the pillar of the Dharma. He further instructed the assembly on the meaning of enduring devotion, saying: \"You, the pure assembly, having heard the true Dharma today, must further cultivate, revere, and uphold this *Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct*. To recite this scripture is to draw near the August Jade Emperor, fostering a heart of reverence, awe, and devotion. Knowing the scripture’s sanctity prevents disrespect toward Heaven’s Dao; recognizing its weight prevents disregard for Heaven’s treasures. Perpetual reverence ensures no defiance or irreverence, and the Great Dao is naturally attained—just as the *Analects* speaks of awe for Heaven’s mandate and awe for the words of sages. Though drawing near the Emperor is not the same as truly beholding the Jade Emperor, if one cannot face him even for a moment, one cannot maintain reverence for even that moment. Fixing the mind upon the Jade Emperor’s august countenance and wondrous form is not merely an act of imagination; it is as though he were truly present, serving the Emperor with clarity. Thus, one’s virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, becoming a supreme sage. Extolling and proclaiming the Emperor’s most sacred names will allow you and the great assembly to behold the Jade Emperor’s radiant, compassionate visage, all receiving his protection and deliverance, universally hearing the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dharma. You will personally offer devotion and veneration to the Emperor and this scripture, forever free from the loss of rebirth and transmigration.\n\nAnother passage states: To see this scripture, hear this wondrous Dharma, and behold the Emperor’s visage, then personally and earnestly revere, venerate, and make offerings, is to forever depart the dust of the mundane and escape the suffering of rebirth and transmigration. Another interpretation holds that the heart will never regress, and further exploration deepens this understanding.\n\nA query arises: The Confucian texts say, \"The spiritual cannot be attained through thought.\" The Daoist scriptures say, \"Spiritual transformation arises without intention, following naturalness.\" The Buddhist scriptures say, \"One who seeks the Tathāgata through form or sound walks the wrong path and cannot see the Thus-Come One.\" Yet here it is said, \"Fix the mind upon the august countenance, extol the sacred name, and only then will you behold the compassionate visage.\" Could the words of the Primordial Beginning and Mysterious Ancestor deceive us? This is not mere mental contemplation or fixation on words and sounds. One’s virtue harmonizes with Heaven, and one’s spirit resonates with the Emperor, merging and forgetting all distinctions. Thus, the ancients said, \"Heaven’s majesty does not depart from the space before one’s face.\" Through reverence and transformation, praise and extolling arise unconsciously—just as the Confucian texts say, \"Speak the words of Yao, act as Yao acted, and you are Yao.\" The Buddhist teachings say, \"The Dharmakāya enters my nature, and my nature unites with the Tathāgata.\" The Daoist scriptures say, \"When spirit unites with the Dao, the Dao and the self become one.\" Only thus can one hear the wondrous Dharma, make offerings, and escape rebirth. If one merely contemplates in the heart or extols with the mouth, failing to return the body, spirit, and life to the Dao, merging the mind with its truth, this cannot be called true veneration—how then can one escape rebirth? To attain ultimate freedom from descent and unchanging permanence, the acts of fixing the mind, extolling, and making offerings must transcend worldly understanding.\n\nThe foolish observe: Human life and nature are endowed by Heaven, and none are without them. Yet, mired in the mundane stream, one sinks into the cycles of rebirth. If one can master the great principles of the world, fully realizing one’s nature, this is true cultivation and reverence for the Jade Emperor’s scripture. To face and serve Heaven is to draw near the Emperor. With utmost care and reverence, serving without transgression, one nurtures a heart of devotion. The body acts as Heaven’s agent, the mouth speaks Heaven’s words, following Heaven without partiality—this is the Emperor’s true governance. Thus, contemplating the Jade Emperor’s countenance, extolling his name, one receives the blessing of beholding his visage. Virtue is one, and every action is auspicious. Fully realizing oneself, others, and all things, participating in transformation and nurturance, returning life and sincerity, embodying form with utmost likeness, utmost sincerity without cease, enduring without end—this is to receive protection and deliverance, universally hear the wondrous Dharma, personally offer devotion and veneration, and forever escape rebirth.\n\nAlas! The Dao within humanity must be sought without departure. The scriptures of the Dao are like paths for the traveler; to tread the great way, how can one not follow this path? This is what Confucius meant by \"How could one not follow the Dao?\" The Primordial Beginning said that the common cannot see the Emperor. Yet those who truly savor this scripture’s meaning will naturally stand shoulder to shoulder with the Jade Emperor.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: Spiritual Powers**\nAt that time, the four assemblies, having heard this teaching, rejoiced and leapt with joy, exclaiming that such wonders had never been before. The Heavenly Official Great Emperor declared: At this moment of expounding the Jade Scripture, the four assemblies of the Dharma gathering heard the Primordial Beginning Dao Ancestor complete the *Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct: Spiritual Powers Chapter* in the Heaven of Subtle Light. They heard of the Emperor’s wondrous birth and growth, his many lifetimes of cultivation, his boundless transformations, his unfathomable merit and virtue, his natural spiritual responses, and the supreme greatness of his Dharma. The jade maidens attending him were transformed from celestial beings. The vast kalpas of the sand realms all depend on this scriptural Dharma. It clarifies the causes of sin and fortune, and one hears the wondrous principles of severing obstacles. The seventeen great radiant lights have their foundation; the cultivation of truth through billions of kalpas has its essentials. Taking the Dharma as one’s model, entering sagehood is effortless. Rejoicing in the shedding of karmic dust and the ease of entering the seven abodes, all were filled with joy and delight, leaping and exulting in unison, praising with one voice.\n\nHere at this Dharma assembly, the most excellent karmic conditions converge—this rare encounter is no mere coincidence. This assembly, this hearing, this Emperor, this scripture, this moment, this teaching—such has never been seen across kalpas past. Some may say that upon hearing this discourse, one should focus solely on the methods of severing demonic obstructions, taking it too narrowly. When the Primordial Dao Ancestor expounded the scripture, the *Divine Transformations Chapter* was concluded—not that after finishing, He spoke again. Though divided into three scrolls and five chapters, it was out of compassionate instruction that the celestial perfected arranged the teachings into three scrolls. To regard the concluding praises of the final scroll as identical to other laudations would be to miss the deeper meaning. Thus, upon hearing this discourse, one must also bear in mind what precedes it. Let the reader examine this carefully.\n\nIn my humble view: The spirit, qi, and blood of the human body obey the celestial sovereign within; the wondrous mind is luminously clear, the celestial melody resounds, harmony flows naturally, and supreme harmony arises spontaneously. Hands dance and feet leap, boundless joy unfolds, and in attaining the Dao, one forgets all scheming—nothing in the world surpasses this. Even the four assemblies who hear this teaching rejoice and exult, marveling at what has never before existed. Yet the world is drowned in profit and desire, few awaken to truth, and those who enter sagehood and achieve perfection are rarely seen. If one hears the scripture and inwardly comprehends it, embodying supreme harmony while mind and spirit merge with transformation, is the Emperor’s work not already within me?\n\n**Examination of Chapter Divisions in the First Scroll**\nWhen the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the *Collected Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct*, the celestial perfected inquired about the origins of the Emperor’s transformations. Though their words differed, all occurred in a single moment—why then was the first scroll divided into thirty-six chapters? The scripture’s exposition unfolded in one instant, but questions and answers varied. Later, unable to fully grasp the scripture’s purport, the profound and mysterious teachings of the supreme sage, the celestial emperors, gods, and perfected—along with the Five Elder Emperor Lords—collated the text, while the Heavenly Strategist continued the compilation afterward. The Wenchang Emperor and the Celestial Pivot Minister each, in their time, offered critical assessments and corrections, designating the first section as *The Divine Transformations Chapter of the Clear Subtlety Heavenly Palace*—no other chapter was so distinguished, for the Emperor’s divine transformations are peerless, His station supreme. This teaching of the Primordial Ancestor is beyond the speech of all immortals and buddhas.\n\nDuring the Han, Wei Boyang; in the Tang, Lü Chunyang; in the Yuan, Qiu Changchun; and in the Ming, Luo Nian’an—all discussed this in great detail, dividing it into chapter annotations. The first scroll’s *Divine Transformations Chapter* thus comprises thirty-six chapters, not arbitrarily dissecting the true words but aligning with the meaning of the thirty-six heavens to establish the divisions. Each demarcation carries intent, the ideas interconnected, preventing fragmentation. If those who recite and study this scripture purify their minds and still their thoughts, embodying the supreme sage’s intent in expounding the scripture and the perfected’s purpose in dividing the chapters, their spirits will resonate with the sagely and true. When the scripture’s vital essence flows uninterrupted, what need is there to distinguish thirty-six chapters? And how could the scripture’s purport remain unattainable?\n\nYet those who cling to the text are many, while those who inwardly comprehend without tiring are few. Some dismiss the scripture as useless, others seize upon a single phrase as extraordinary, or fixate on a single character as flawed. They distinguish between *Lingbao* and *Gaoshang* in name only, failing to listen with the heart and grasp the wondrous communion of the spirit. Thus, through the scripture, they cannot awaken to the Dao, instead becoming ensnared by the obstacle of words—this is the gravest delusion.\n\nAlas! The ultimate teachings of all scriptures are the seal of the mind. Through words, one perceives the Dao; having attained the Dao, one forgets words. The profound and hidden discourses are all the inherent principles within us—why doubt their difficulty or, worse, disparage them lightly? A single moment of attainment should not breed complacency. These prefatory and concluding remarks are appended as a warning to scholars.\n\n**Commentary on the Imperial Scripture, Scroll Four**\n*End of the First Scroll’s Thirty-Six Chapters*\n\n**Collected Commentaries on the Imperial Scripture, Scroll Five**\n\n**The Orthodox Transmission of the Daoist Canon, Continued Daoist Canon**\n\n**The Highest Emperor’s Original Acts Scripture, Scroll Two**\n\nFrom the preceding scroll’s *Divine Powers Chapter* to the sacred transformations of the Heavenly Officials. The sagely and true of the Three Teachings are all beyond easy attainment, hence this is listed first to show the origin of the divine transformations in this true scripture.\n\nThis section begins with the *Divine Incantations Chapter*, for the scripture contains secret dharma-words. They can deliver humans and record immortals, restrain stars, subdue demons, govern waters, pacify the five directions, and succor the dharma-realm—thus they are called \"divine incantations.\" Following the divine powers with their secret dharma-words and esoteric texts, such benefits place this as the second chapter.\n\n**The Great Illuminating Perfect Radiance Divine Incantations Chapter, Second**\n*Divine Incantations Chapter, First Section*\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Ancestor of Heaven and Earth, the Five Elder Thearchs, bowed their heads and knelt in reverence, addressing the Heavenly Venerable:\n\n\"We have heard that the Highest Jade Emperor, in great compassion for sentient beings, universally emits divine radiance, illuminating the dharma-realm. The six realms of the ordinary and the four ranks of the sagely all partake of the blessings of the Dao’s shelter.\n\nWe humbly consider that the lifespan of ordinary beings is brief, and the kalpa’s destiny nears its end. The true Dao ought to be propagated to deliver the multitudes, allowing those who cultivate reality to have a time for light ascent, and the people of the latter age to all attain longevity.\n\nAt that time, when the Primordial Heavenly Venerable had finished expounding the *Divine Powers Chapter*, the Primordial Ancestor of Heaven and Earth’s inception, the Five Directions’ Five Spirits, and the Five Elder Thearchs bowed their heads in obeisance, prostrated in reverence, and addressed the Primordial Heavenly Venerable:\n\n'We have heard that the Highest Jade Emperor, in great mercy, pities the sentient beings of the world, universally emitting the great divine powers of boundless true radiance, illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds, all heavens and earths, and every dharma-realm. The six kinds of ordinary beings—heavenly, human, demonic, hellish, hungry ghosts, and animals—as well as the four ranks of the sagely—those of the supreme vehicle, and the upper, middle, and lower vehicles, the immortals, buddhas, spirits, and aspirants—all universally partake of the blessings of the great Dao’s compassionate radiance.\n\nWe humbly consider that ordinary beings are short-lived, the world’s span is fleeting, and the kalpa’s destiny in the dharma-realm nears its end. The true Dao of immortals ought to be transmitted and practiced to deliver the billions of people, allowing those who aspire to immortality and cultivate reality to have a time for liberation, attaining lightness of body and ascension, while the people of the latter age suffer no premature death and all attain longevity.\n\nYet human life in the world has a fixed destiny, and the sages of the Three Teachings all shed their bones in the dust. Yanzi, the great worthy, died at thirty-two. Though the *August Scripture* brings benefits, how can it defy the great workings of creation and grant humans immortality?'\n\nThis is not so. The human body may die, but the principle of human life does not perish. If the Dao is not understood, though one lives in the world, the heart is already dead—merely clinging to life in cowardice, how can this be called longevity? If one comprehends the Dao, awakens thoroughly, and completes practice, returning to emptiness and transcending transformation, then to hear the Dao in the morning and die by evening leaves no regret—this is true longevity.\n\nThus the *Dao De Jing* states: 'That which dies yet does not perish is longevity.' Confucius said: 'Human life is upright.' He also said: 'The humane are long-lived.' The Buddhist scriptures say: 'If one fully realizes nirvana, one sees the Tathagata—this is called the indestructible vajra.'\n\nThe perfected of the Three Teachings do not regard death as death, but ignorance of the Dao as death; they do not regard life as life, but realization of the Dao as life. Though the workings of creation make birth and death inescapable, they may bind ordinary people but cannot bind the sages.\n\nThe *August Scripture of the Jade Emperor* was expounded by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable as the supreme vehicle’s wondrous dharma, the true essence of the Three Teachings, the profound secret of the myriad methods, the compassionate vessel of the dharma-realm, the crucial gate of life and death, the esoteric meaning of formation, duration, decay, and emptiness, the pivot of kalpas’ turning, the broad path of transcendence and realization, the wondrous means of delivering the world, and the bridge for untying knots and removing transgressions.\n\nIf the Most Venerable compassionately expounds this scripture, once the multitudes receive the sagely grace and rely on the power of divine radiance, all may return to the true dharma, avoid deviant paths, and face life and death without shame. It can grant short-lived beings long life—such is the divine efficacy of this scripture.\"\n\n*Seal of the sound, yin.* (蒸 is interchangeable with 烝.)\n\nAt the kalpa’s end when the final age draws near,\nthe *Divine Incantations* chapter two:\n\nFrom of old, the *Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Vermilion Script Jade Chapters True Writ* arose before the Primordial Beginning, within the empty void—ere heaven and earth took root, ere sun and moon shone forth, in profound obscurity, without ancestor or lineage, without qi or image, without color or name, without form or trace, without sound or voice, in the chaos of the Great Nonbeing. The numinous writ, veiled in dim haze, flickered in and out of existence, now present, now absent. Yet when the numinous diagram unfolded and transformation began, when the mysterious signs shifted and qi congealed to float in the void, riding the turning of the mechanism to meet its destined moment, the *Jade Emperor’s True Teachings*, the *Numinous Treasure Secret Scripts*, and the inconceivable, supreme divine incantations came into being.\n\nThe Five Venerable Lords, Ancestors of Heaven and Earth, declared that the true Dao of the *August Emperor’s Venerable Scripture* could grant longevity to the multitudes of the final age—how did it come to possess such vast efficacy?\n\nFrom of old, the *Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Great Vermilion Celestial Writ*’s true writ of azure jade and jasper chapters arose before the dharma-realm was established, before the Primordial Beginning’s original inception, within the vast emptiness of the Great Void—ere the Two Modes had divided, ere the Supreme Ultimate or Non-Ultimate, ere heaven and earth had laid their foundations, ere yin and yang, water and fire had begun their gestation, ere sun and moon had cast their light. Vast and indistinct, how could one discern its divisions? Only profound obscurity reigned. The myriad forms had not yet arisen—what could precede them? The origin of creation was unseen; it was without ancestor or lineage. In the mysterious emptiness of the Great Void, no qi was visible, no forms or images existed, no colors to be perceived, no names to be uttered, no shapes or shadows, no beginnings or ends, no echoes or traces. Silent and desolate, what sounds or voices could there be? Boundless and infinite, it was the chaos of the Great Nonbeing.\n\nThe true writ of the *Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Vermilion Script Jade Chapters*, its numinous and secret radiance, though veiled in dimness and not clearly seen, yet faintly revealed its traces—now present, now absent, neither existent nor nonexistent, neither being nor nonbeing, existing yet never truly existing, nonexistent yet never truly nonexistent.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning’s numinous workings unfolded the mysterious diagram, opening the myriad transformations. The wondrous signs of the mysterious origin shifted and turned, congealing the subtle qi of Brahma to pervade the empty void, riding the mechanism of the mysterious workings to meet the destined moment when the true Dao should spread its blessings upon heaven and humankind. The *Jade Emperor’s Precious Teachings*, the *Numinous Treasure’s Secret Celestial Scripts*, and their immeasurable, inconceivable supreme virtues—these divine incantations then manifested their secrets and took form, and the wondrous dharma came into being.\n\nThe Vermilion Script, the true writ of the *Jade Emperor’s Venerable Scripture* and the wondrous existence, was all formed from the primordial Brahma-qi of the heavens. Its characters spanned a *zhang* in length, their crimson light resplendent, written in great vermilion gold upon jade chapters in the Cinnabar Heaven. Above the Nine Heavens, all were azure-jade chapters, the writ of the *Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure*. Their radiance like precious rosy clouds, their luster like jade—hence called the *Jade Chapters*.\n\nThey arose before the Primordial Beginning, before the original inception of heaven and earth—not before the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. \"Ere heaven and earth took root\" does not mean heaven and earth lacked a generative root; rather, heaven and earth were born from the formless. The Primordial Beginning’s true writ existed before the Three Thousand Great Worlds were established, before the beginning of kalpas. Thus, ere the root of heaven and earth’s division was seen, it flickered in and out of existence—present yet its form undefinable, absent yet its truth never extinguished.\n\nThe *Jade Emperor’s True Speech* and the *August Scripture’s* wondrous canon bring boundless compassion, enduring through kalpas without measure, pervading the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds without end. All heavens uphold it; the Three Teachings revere and follow it—it is the decree of the kalpa-turning dharma-realm.\n\nThe *Numinous Treasure Secret Scripts*, the celestial cloud-script, are not easily encountered or perceived, beyond conception or discourse, beyond the reach of thought or speech. Thus they came into being.\n\nThe true writ of the *Jade Scripture* existed before the kalpas—it did not arise only now, nor did it await the destined moment of its revelation. The Dao embraces the Great Void—what form could it have? Who could perceive it? Though present, none knew of its presence. Now, as the true Dao spreads its rightful course, the numinous writ reveals its secrets, its divine radiance shining forth in brilliance. Thus it is said to have come into being at this time. The presence of the true scripture’s wondrous dharma, meeting its destined moment, is a rare and fleeting occasion. Those who encounter this gathering—how could they bear to neglect it and not seek the teachings?\n\n*Divine Incantations* chapter three:\n\nThus, heaven and earth received it and divided; the Three Luminaries received it and shone forth. The numinous writ flourished in splendor, illuminating the Highest Clarity, emanating from the Celestial Beginning of Azure, its colors unbounded, its patterns intricate and winding, difficult to trace in detail.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning refined it in the Cavern of Yang, forged it in the Courtyard of Flowing Fire. The resonant tones preceded its true text, its brilliance gleaming forth. As the Cavern of Yang’s qi was crimson, it was named the *Vermilion Script*. Once the numinous diagram shone forth, the Five Emperors paid homage to the true, soaring through the void, circling the Upper Palace, burning incense and scattering flowers, chanting the numinous verses.\n\nAt that time, heaven manifested twelve mysterious omens, earth produced twenty-four responses. Above, the Nine Heavens’ numinous mysteries were celebrated; the Three Heavens’ precious radiance was praised. The divine winds stirred, and the August Dao flowed unimpeded.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning issued the decree; the Perfected of Great Purity took up the brush. The Jade Consort swept the mat; gold was cast into tablets, jade carved into script. The Five Venerable Lords recorded it, sealing it in the Celestial Capital’s numinous palace. Jade maidens tended the incense; the Great Flower held the cloth. Golden lads stood guard; jade steps led to the celestial hall. The Nine Heavens’ jade script was not for ghosts or spirits to hear—only the true writ of the *Jade Scripture* and the *Numinous Treasure Secret Scripts* came into being at this time.\n\nThus, the Supreme Ultimate gave birth to the Two Modes: the pure floated to become Heaven, the turbid congealed to become Earth. Heaven and earth received it and divided. The sun’s brilliance shone, the moon displayed its splendor, the stars arrayed themselves—the Three Luminaries received it and shone forth.\n\nThe true scriptures and numinous writs, dense with their auspicious radiance and luminous qi, shone resplendently, illuminating the Upper Clarity’s realms. They emanated from the Primordial Azure’s supreme heavens, their hues unbound by fixed form or place. The radiant might of these numinous writs filled every winding path, their depths too profound for tracing or fathoming.\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy refined these true writs in the Cavernous Yang’s Double Mystery Hall, smelting this scripture in the Flowing Fire’s Great Brahmā Court. He purified their orthodox text, their brilliance boundless. He clarified their great, correct, wondrous, and existent writs, causing them to gleam and surge with luminous splendor. The Cavernous Yang’s wondrous qi overflowed with cinnabar radiance, purely crimson—thus named the *Crimson Writs*. The numinous destiny’s mysterious charts, now resplendent with light, drew the Five Thearchs to pay homage at the Origin. The Perfected rode clouds and auspicious omens, soaring through empty space, circling the supreme palaces in ritual procession. They burned the pure and spontaneous true incense, scattered celestial blossoms, and chanted the numinous writs’ precious chapters.\n\nAt that time, Heaven did not withhold the Dao, and the primal celestial bodies offered auspicious signs—twelve mysterious omens appeared in the heavens. Earth did not withhold its treasures, and the twenty-four qi manifested in their purest form, revealing twenty-four terrestrial responses. Above, the nine heavens’ numinous writs’ profound meanings were celebrated; the three heavens’ precious chapters were extolled. The wondrous canon shone brilliantly, its divine teachings spreading like the wind. The mechanism for delivering the world was set in motion, the imperial Dao flourished universally, and the great Dharma universally bestowed its blessings upon all.\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy ascended his throne and bestowed his mandate. The Supreme Perfected and transcendents held brushes to inscribe it. Jade consorts and numinous consorts swept the ritual mats. Indestructible golden light was cast into mysterious tablets and secret writs; azure jade’s mystic radiance was carved into cinnabar script. The Five Directions’ Five Numinous Ones and Five Venerable Lords recorded and transmitted it, sealing it in the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Numinous Mysterious Capital’s halls. Jade maidens tended the celestial incense; the Great Flower Perfected held the mystic cloth. Golden lads stood in attendance, guarding the jasper steps that led to the celestial halls. The Nine Heavens’ jade graphs and cinnabar script—these were not for any ghost or spirit to hear.\n\nOnly after Heaven and Earth existed did written characters come to be, and the scriptures were transmitted. Yet now it is said that the *August Scripture* existed before Heaven and Earth divided. Many who hear this grow doubtful and confused. Yet the Dao’s spontaneity, its ceaseless mutual succession, is what makes it true writ; the Dao’s indestructibility is what makes it true scripture. The Primordial existed before the kalpas’ vastness, and the *August Scripture*’s principle was already present. The true writ has no characters, its wondrous transformations are inexhaustible. Thus, Heaven and Earth divided from this, and the Three Luminaries shone forth from this. This is the true principle—what doubt remains?\n\nThe text’s winding structure has led some to misread characters as phonetic loans, but this is incorrect. The phrase \"purified their orthodox text\" has been misconstrued as \"explained their orthodox text,\" but this is wrong. *Ying* (莹) is pronounced like *ying* (盈), not read as *xun* (巽) or *xin* (信). The mysterious scripture has no form—how could it be called \"golden tablets\"? Yet the mysterious light’s wondrous image endures beyond kalpas without destruction, hence it is called \"golden tablets and jade script.\" The mysterious writ’s radiant auspiciousness, its lustrous dignity, is thus called \"jade script.\" \"Not for any ghost or spirit to hear\"—the *August Scripture*’s profound mystery is unknown to ghosts and spirits, for it is not an ordinary hearing, nor an easy hearing, nor a hearing within the capacity of the common.\n\nThe *Divine Incantations* in four chapters:\nThus, Heaven treasures it to attain purity, Earth secretes it to attain tranquility, the Five Thearchs wield it to attain numinosity, the Three Luminaries ride it to attain brilliance, the supreme sages uphold it to attain the divine, the lofty spirits revere it to attain the true, the Five Marchmounts follow it to attain stability, the Son of Heaven obtains it to attain governance, and the dynastic mandate relies on it to attain peace. Truly, it is the wondrous power of the *Numinous Treasure*, the mysterious root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIts majestic numinosity is vast and boundless, universally bestowing its inexhaustible blessings. The great transformation is expansive and unobstructed, the origin of all divine luminaries. Its measure is unfathomable, towering like the great void. At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy transformed the era of primordial chaos. Mystic images unfolded in the numinous charts; the numinous writs flourished in radiant splendor. They distinguished the workings of positions and transformations, manifesting the divine in the Five Directions—east, west, south, north, and center—dividing above as Heaven and below as Earth, opening and transforming the Dharma-realm’s myriad numinous beings and all species. This is the Double Mystery’s true and secret treasure—might one briefly glimpse its numinous essence through the imperial teachings, unfolding the supreme true and secret origin?\n\nThus, Heaven’s position is above, and by treasuring this true scripture, it attains the True One and achieves eternal purity. Earth’s position is below, and by secretly upholding this true scripture, it attains the True One and achieves eternal tranquility. The Five Directions’ Five Thearchs wield this secret writ to attain divine transformations and become the Five Numinous Ones. The sun, moon, and stars—the Three Luminaries—ride this true scripture’s wondrous Dharma to ascend in lofty brilliance. The supreme sages and perfected ones uphold this true scripture to attain a sageliness beyond comprehension and ascend in divine loftiness. The divine departments revere this true scripture to attain the true and sagely positions. The Five Marchmounts’ sacred thearchs, through this true scripture’s power, remain unshaken and attain secure stability. The Son of Heaven who rules all under Heaven obtains this true scripture’s wondrous Dharma to achieve governance without care. The nation’s mandate and enterprise rely on this true scripture to attain peaceful rule.\n\nTruly, it is the wondrous power of the *Numinous Treasure*’s true origin, the mysterious root of Heaven and Earth’s true origin. This scripture’s celestial majesty and numinous efficacy are vast beyond measure, boundless and without limit. Across the kalpas’ vastness and the Dharma-realm, all benefits are inexhaustible. Universally bestowed without end, its transformations are vast and unobstructed, its merit and influence formless and boundless. Truly, it is the great and immeasurable divine transformation, the true origin of all divine luminaries—its merit and measure are beyond all reckoning. Without form or origin, towering and unattainable like the great void.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy transformed the era of primordial chaos. Mystic light’s wondrous images unfolded the numinous charts; the numinous writs flourished in radiant splendor. They distinguished the workings of positions and transformations, manifesting the divine in the Five Directions—east, west, south, north, and center—dividing above as Heaven and below as Earth, opening and transforming the Dharma-realm’s myriad numinous beings and all species. This Double Mystery’s true and secret treasure—might one briefly glimpse its numinous essence through the imperial teachings, unfolding the supreme true and secret origin?\n\nUnfolding—alternatively rendered as \"perusing.\" The imperial scriptures are Daoist parlance, originally for cultivating and verifying immortal ranks, not for governing equitably or achieving universal peace. Yet here it speaks of the Son of Heaven attaining governance through them, and the nation’s fortune relying on them to achieve peace—why? For only when the Dao transforms and completes does governance and peace arise. Awakening to the true origin and illuminating the great Dao, one gains trust without speech, transformation without action, and accomplishment without striving. When virtue flourishes, its transformative power becomes divine, eternally benefiting all without limit. Thus it is said: governance is achieved, and governance is made equitable. Wondrous virtue is fundamentally without attainment, without visible bestowal, yet its transformative efficacy is boundless—hence it is called \"wondrous virtue.\"\n\nAs for the Mystic Root: all roots possess form, yet when the Dao generates Heaven and Earth, though it encompasses the Limitless, the Supreme Ultimate’s diagram of the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth) originates from what is itself without form. The true cannot be seen, cannot be spoken, and diagrams are but provisional images to instruct people. What tangible form does the root of Heaven and Earth possess? Though without tangible form, its cyclical revolutions are inexhaustible—thus it is called the Mystic Root. Its numinous might: the sages and deities of the Three Teachings dare not slight it, for its wondrous transformations are boundless—hence it is called \"numinous might.\" The origin of divine luminaries: all sages take it as their foundational method. It is also said: the thousand spirits and myriad sages emerge from this. The great void: its beginning unseen, its end unseen, indistinct and formless—hence it is called the great void. \"Revolutionizing the era\": some say it refers to the revolution of an ending era, but this is incorrect. This scripture existed before the vast kalpas, and thus it revolutionizes the era of primordial chaos.\n\n\"Manifesting the divine in the Five Directions\": in primordial chaos, there was no distinction, yet the Dao’s wondrous transformations differentiated positions, distinguishing inner and outer—hence it is said \"manifesting the divine in the Five Directions.\"\n\n**Chapter Five of the Divine Incantations**\nNow, as the imperial Dao flourishes and spreads, its blessings extend to the ten directions. Gazing upon the kalpic cycles and cosmic currents, the true wind of the Dao ought to be propagated. Your servant’s heart truly desires that the numinous shade of the Dao may reach the eight farthest reaches, its beneficent breeze perfuming the orchid groves, so that withered branches, long devoid of vitality, may lift their heads in hope of the luxuriance of the Southern Marchmount, and decayed remains may receive the life-giving moisture of the Dao’s profound and arcane teachings. The *Luminous Perfected* sets forth its standards—today, these must be enacted in the world. Looking up to the Primordial Compassion and prostrating below in sincere entreaty, I only pray for Your mercy to turn toward the teeming masses.\n\nI wonder: might the *True Writs of the Numinous Treasure Jade Chapters* be granted for revelation, to be taught to those who have not yet heard? The treasure of the Mystic Origin—I hope to briefly glimpse its numinous essence. Now, as the great Dao spreads and flourishes, its compassionate grace permeates the four cardinal and four intermediate directions, reaching from the highest to the lowest, its blessings extending to the ten directions. Gazing upon the kalpic cycles and cosmic currents, the true wind of the proper Dao ought to be advanced. Your servant’s heart truly desires that the blessings of the Numinous Treasure Dharma may overshadow all worlds in every direction, reaching even the eight farthest reaches. May the Dao’s beneficent breeze and transformative grace bathe the orchid groves and fragrant jewel gardens. May all beings in the world—those mired in stagnation, adherents of heterodox paths, demonic and external cults, the sentient and insentient, those who have not heard the proper Dao—all receive the deliverance of the true scriptures. Like withered branches long devoid of vitality, may they lift their heads in hope of the warmth and moisture of the Southern Marchmount’s luxuriance, their withered forms revived and made flourishing. May decayed remains receive the life-giving moisture of the profound and arcane teachings of the sacred writs. The *Luminous Perfected* Transcendent Lords possess the golden standards for delivering the world—today, these must be enacted in the world. Looking up to the Primordial Beginning’s great compassion and prostrating below in sincere entreaty, I only pray that the sagely compassion may turn toward the teeming masses.\n\nI wonder: might the *True Writs of the Numinous Treasure Jade Chapters* be granted for revelation in the world, to be taught to those who have not yet heard?\n\nThe ten directions: not merely the small ten directions of this realm, but the ten directions encompassing the three thousand great thousand worlds. The kalpic cycles: from kalpa to kalpa, endlessly revolving, this true governance of the world persists through every kalpa, not merely one kalpa or one era. The eight farthest reaches: the utmost distances of the three thousand great thousand worlds, not merely the eight directions visible before us. The orchid groves: fragrant jewel gardens. Heaven, Earth, and all beings possess this proper principle, and all have these groves. Yet beings, deluded, do not perceive them. The supreme perfected transcendent sages—these groves radiate their jewel-like splendor. The beneficent breeze: its grace suffuses these groves, its blessings extending to all without limit. The withered branches: beings—humans, spirits, and ghosts—who do not comprehend the proper Dharma are like deadwood. Upon hearing the true scriptures and awakening, they are like withered trees reviving. The decayed remains: beings who do not know the proper Dao, though alive, are as if dead. Upon hearing the true scriptures and transcending, even their desiccated bones are reborn. The life-giving moisture of the profound and arcane: the moisture that nourishes and revives. The *Luminous Perfected*: the Perfected Lords ennobled by the Jade Emperor. Sincere entreaty: exhausting the depths of one’s sincerity in earnest supplication to the Most Sagely. The teeming masses: those with dark hair turning white in old age, their color ashen and uncertain—hence called \"teeming.\" It is also said: the people born of the azure heavens. It is also said: the teeming masses are the multitudes. The Numinous Treasure: the Jade Chapters, the True Writs—all explained previously. \"Granted for revelation\": entreating the Heavenly Worthy to transmit these scriptures, to teach them to all spirits, humans, ghosts, and beings in the Dharma-realm, delivering those who have not yet heard them. \"Might they be granted for revelation to those who have not heard?\"—this is a humble and tentative phrasing, not presuming to assert definitively, for fear that the Most Revered and Wondrous Dharma may not be easily transmitted. Thus, the entreaty is made first, couched in tentative language, to convey the urgency of the request and the utmost reverence.\n\n**Chapter Six of the Divine Incantations**\nThereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy stroked the armrest, raised His voice, and entered profound contemplation, gazing afar. Perceiving the time had come, He universally addressed the assembly of all true sages and saints, deliberating on yin and yang, calculating the convergences of kalpas, adjusting the reckonings of the River Source, inspecting the celestial measures, selecting the seed-people, pointing to the Supreme Non-Being, and whistling to illuminate the Nine Mysteries. Though He did not open His ears to their petitions, it was as if barriers obstructed the path to seeking the true.\n\nAt that time, the Five Elder Thearchs repeatedly posed their questions. After a long while, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy deigned to cast His gaze upon them and, with a sigh, exclaimed: \"How subtle and profound! What you now inquire—is it not excellent? This is the Mystic Root of the Primordial Numinous Treasure, the true writs of the empty and spontaneous, which generate Heaven and establish Earth, open and transform the divine luminaries, bestow stability upon the Five Marchmounts, and bring peace and well-being to the nation and its people.\"\n\nThe numinous treasure’s profound mystery stands as the most exalted of all things, with celestial omens and numinous responses arising spontaneously. The *True Writs of the Numinous Treasure* ought to be bestowed as teachings to those yet unenlightened.\n\nAt that moment, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy caressed the jade table before Him, seated upon His precious throne, His majestic Dao-body towering and unbowed. In silent concentration of the utmost truth, He silently unfurled His boundless wisdom, gazing afar into past, present, and future. Perceiving that the time for universal deliverance had arrived, He prepared for this grand convergence, where the six conditions aligned, and all dharma-realms awaited this auspicious moment. All worlds’ celestial perfected and sagely beings deliberated upon the convergence of yin and yang, the cyclical renewal of the primordial, the reckoning of the natural rhythms of generation and transformation, the great and lesser kalpas and cosmic epochs. They adjusted the measures of the River Source’s Water Thearch, examined and recorded the celestial reckonings, selected those of good karmic seed and virtuous cultivation, pointed to the Supreme Non-Being, and chanted the ninefold mysterious verses in luminous recitation.\n\nMindful of the Five Elder Thearchs’ earnest pleas for the transmission of the Dharma, He knew that to withhold His compassionate assent would be as if sealing off the path to cultivating the Dao and seeking the true. At that time, the Five Elder Thearchs persisted in their supplications without cease. After a long while, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy at last unveiled His merciful countenance, His sacred gaze descending in illumination. With a sigh, He exclaimed: \"How subtle and wondrous! How abysmally profound! Is not the question you now pose most excellent? This is the Mystic Root of the Primordial Numinous Treasure, the true writs of the wondrous transformations of the empty and spontaneous. They give birth to the Qian Heaven and establish the Kun Earth, open and transform all worlds’ sagely and numinous beings, stabilize the Five Marchmounts—East Tai, South Heng (also called Heng), West Hua, North Heng, and Central Song—bring peace to successive dynasties, and ensure the well-being of all dharma-realm beings.\n\nThe profound subtlety of the Numinous Treasure is most exalted among all things. Heaven manifests mysterious auspices, Earth emits felicitous omens, and all numinous responses arise naturally. *Caressing the table* refers to leaning upon the jade table of mysterious transformation, no ordinary desk. *Towering and unbowed* does not imply arrogance but describes His majestic Dao-body, the towering and immovable model of the mysterious. *Gazing afar* is sometimes mistakenly written as *thought*, but this is incorrect. *Deliberating upon yin and yang, reckoning kalpas and epochs*—the perfected and sagely are not bound by numbers. The Great Dao cannot be lightly transmitted; its timing is spontaneous. The sacred teachings do not force themselves upon the unwilling.\n\n*Adjusting the measures of the River Source* and *recording the celestial reckonings* encompass all waters below and all heavens above, every world and all classes of beings—all are delivered. *Selecting the seed-people* does not refer solely to the virtuous. The teachings make no distinctions; when the true scriptures are expounded to the virtuous, all beings receive grace. *Pointing to the Supreme Non-Being*—the Dao’s foundation is the Great Non-Being; how can it be grasped? The Primordial Most High, in expounding these true scriptures, reveals the supreme vehicle, the true essence of the Three Teachings, the profound mystery of the empty and non-dual, enabling all who hear to attain awakening—this is what is meant by *pointing out*. *Nine Mysteries* may also be rendered as *ninefold profound mystery*, which is also acceptable.\n\n*Gaze* refers to parting the eyes and opening the pupils, casting light upon the corners of the eyes—hence *gaze upon the corners*. It is also said that *訾* means the whites of the eyes. *Gaze* is sometimes written as *盻*, but this is incorrect.\n\nThe Primordial Most High and Perfectly Sagely One—why is the inquiry of the Five Elders of Heaven and Earth deemed virtuous? It is because they seek the true scriptures, discerning the opportune moment for their benefits, their wisdom and insight profound and subtle—hence it is called *virtuous*.\n\n*Opening and transforming the numinous and luminous* gives rise to all immortals, gods, and buddhas.\nThe remaining explanations may be found above.\n\n眦 is pronounced *zī*, or alternatively *zǐ*.\n\n**Seven Chapters of Divine Incantations**\nNow, as the reckoning of the Three Heavens unfolds and the Way of the Six Heavens operates, miscellaneous teachings emerge—there shall be thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao to dispel the doubts of those who come seeking. When this Dharma-kalpa concludes, after the Three Dragons (the three kalpas of Dragon Han) and the year of *gēngzǐ*, all杂气 shall be universally dissolved. The assemblies of the heavens shall rejoice, and Our True Dao shall then prevail.\n\nFor now, it may be entrusted, to be recorded in the Upper Celestial Repository, though it shall not yet circulate in the lower mortal world. The Mysterious Statutes bear prohibitions; it must not be recklessly transmitted.\n\nYou may proceed to the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace of the Numinous Capital, there to hearken to the celestial sounds inscribed upon the Golden Tablet, to observe the obeisance and reverence before the Divine Kings. Only then shall you be enabled to receive the celestial texts, thereby to govern in unison the heavens of the Primordial Most High.\n\n整 is pronounced *lì*.\nIt is not to be written as *垫*.\n\nWhen the true scriptures are transmitted, celestial portents shall manifest, numinous responses shall arise spontaneously—what age is this now? As the Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heaven renew the reckoning of qi, the thirty-six heavens shall simultaneously enact the Dao. Miscellaneous minor teachings shall emerge to open and deliver transformation, giving rise to thirty-six thousand kinds of gateways and principles to resolve the doubts of those who come seeking the Dao.\n\nWhen this Dharma-kalpa concludes, after the Three Dragons (the three kalpas of Dragon Han) and the year of *gēngzǐ*, at the turning of the *Zhēnyuán* kalpa, all杂气 shall be universally dissolved. At the joyous assemblies of the heavens, Our True Dao and Orthodox Dharma shall then prevail.\n\nFor now, it may provisionally be entrusted, to be recorded in the Upper Mysterious Celestial Repository, though it shall not yet circulate in the lower dusty mortal world. The Mysterious Statutes and Celestial Laws bear prohibitions and precepts; it must not be recklessly or lightly transmitted.\n\nYou may personally proceed to the Supreme Palace of Purple Tenuity in the Numinous Capital of the Great Mystery, there to listen to the celestial sounds, to receive the solemn decrees proclaimed upon the Golden Tablet, the transmission of the ordained kalpic reckonings. Observe the obeisance and reverence before the immortals, divine emperors, celestial marshals, and heavenly kings, knowing the preciousness and profound benefits of this Dharma-treasure. Only then shall you be enabled to receive the true scriptures and celestial texts, thereby to govern in unison the heavens of the Primordial Most High’s transforming sovereignty.\n\n整 is pronounced *lì*.\nIt is not to be written as *垫*.\n\nShould one write it as *zhěng*, that too is incorrect.\n\nThe Three Heavens refer to the heavens of the Three Qi—Azure, Crimson, and Yu-Yu. The Six Heavens encompass the realms of Desire, Form, Formlessness, Light Dust, Subtle Dust, Light Defilement, and Subtle Defilement.\n\nThe Celestial Emperors, divine beings, and perfected humans expound the teachings of the Great, Middle, and Lesser Vehicles, each according to their rank in the Dao and their practice. They intersperse minor methods, offering guidance and deliverance.\n\nThere are thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao, for the human body contains thirty-six thousand spirits and qi, varying in purity and strength. Some possess right faith, others hold heterodox views; their root capacities differ, and through learning, they attain what aligns with their nature. Thus, there are the Great Vehicle and the Lesser Vehicle—hence the thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao.\n\nThis is to dispel the doubts of those who come seeking, responding to the inclinations of those who pursue the Dao. Some say it means aligning with the aspirations of seekers, each receiving and upholding what they believe in and resonate with. Those who attain enlightenment speak of it as melting like ice—this is the meaning of *shì* (释), without doubt. To write it as *zé* (择) is incorrect.\n\nThe Three Dragons refer to the beginning, middle, and end of the Dragon Han kalpa. Another account names them Dragon Han, Dragon Kang, and Dragon Zheng. When the miscellaneous qi are universally dispelled, the times grow peaceful, and demonic vapors subside.\n\nThe Celestial Assemblies are auspicious gatherings of all heavens. Another interpretation calls them joyous Dharma assemblies of the heavens.\n\nThe statutes and Celestial Laws bear natural prohibitions. Though the Dao does not select its recipients, to speak of it to the unworthy is to profane the celestial treasure and lose the weight of one’s words. Thus, the sages of the Three Teachings preached only when the time, place, and person were fitting.\n\nThe Golden Tablet and the Mysterious Register are systems for reckoning merit and transgression. To \"observe obeisance before the divine kings\" means to look up to the immortals and perfected ones, and to look down upon the celestial kings and divine marshals.\n\nTo \"govern in unison the heavens of the Primordial Most High’s transforming sovereignty\" means to oversee and administer the heavens transformed by the Primordial Most High. Another interpretation reads *shì* (示) as synonymous with *shì* (视), meaning to demonstrate the proper reverence—looking up and down—before the divine kings, thereby governing the heavens of the Primordial Most High. Both explanations are valid.\n\nTo \"assemble the heavens and draw near in the imperial carriage of the Dao to the supreme heaven of the Primordial Most High\" is also coherent.\n\n**The Eight Chapters of Divine Incantations**\n\nThereupon, the Five Elder Thearchs, together with the perfected sages, bearing pure incense and upholding the precepts, wandered the cloud paths, summoning the ten directions. Ascending to the Supreme Clarity’s Great Mystery Jade Capital, the Hall of Cold Numinosity and Cinnabar Stair, the Supreme Palace of Purple Tenuity, they received the protocols of obeisance. Only then did they recognize the preciousness and solemnity of the celestial perfected, whose teachings are not easily heard. Returning once more before the Dao of the Primordial Most High, they consulted the rites of prohibition and precepts, humbly acknowledging their inadequacy.\n\nAfter listening to the celestial sounds upon the Golden Tablet, they were then enabled to receive the true scriptures and celestial texts.\n\nThereupon, the Five Elder Thearchs of the Five Directions, together with the perfected sages of the heavens, clad in pure incense, upheld the precepts of the Dao, pacing the cloud thoroughfares. They guided and conveyed, lingering and wandering the cloud paths, chanting and proclaiming the decrees to the ten directions’ divine beings. Ascending to the Supreme Clarity’s Great Mystery Jade Capital, the wondrous realm of the celestial palaces, the Hall of Cold Numinosity and Cinnabar Stair, the Supreme Palace of Purple Clarity, they received the protocols of obeisance. Only then did they comprehend the solemn preciousness of the true scriptures and celestial texts, which are not easily heard.\n\nReturning once more before the Dao of the Primordial Most High, they consulted the rites of prohibition and precepts, humbly acknowledging the limitations of their wisdom and insight.\n\nThe \"pure incense\" refers to the incense of true nature, the naturally pure incense of the Dao, the wondrous incense of non-action and right virtue—it is not the burning of worldly incense. To \"uphold the precepts\" means to maintain the solemn and majestic standards of the Mysterious Model, as if standing before the Ancestral Dao. Guarding the precepts of the Celestial Worthy, they wandered in boundless compassion, their radiant Dharma carriage traversing the cloud paths of the ten directions.\n\nThe Confucians of old said, \"The light of heaven and the shadows of clouds wander together\"—this is the meaning. It is not to be compared to the ceaseless coming and going of the mundane world.\n\nTo \"summon the ten directions\" means to issue commands with solemnity, not with whistling or laughter. The character *xiào* (啸) is read as *chì* (勅); to read it as *xiù* (秀) is incorrect. For it denotes the solemn issuance of decrees, not the act of chanting or mirth.\n\nThe \"ten directions\" do not refer to the Ten Numinous Treasures but to the divine hosts of the ten directions. To \"ascend to the immortals and perfected ones\" means to pay homage to the Primordial and receive the Dharma, silently ascending in radiant light to reverently listen to the mysterious teachings—it is not the mundane act of treading upon the steps.\n\nThe Hall of Cold Numinosity is beyond the Nine Heavens, where sound and qi do not reach, where the sun and moon cannot penetrate. The celestial light shines of itself, vast and boundless, pure and coldly solemn. The cinnabar hall gleams with the crimson radiance of great jade—hence its name.\n\nThe Supreme Palace of Purple Tenuity lies above the Purple Empyrean, within the Supreme Clarity’s Great Mystery Heaven—it is not the Purple Tenuity Palace or the Great Tenuity Palace of the mortal world’s celestial asterisms.\n\nThe protocols of obeisance have been explained previously. \"Not easily heard\" does not mean it is difficult to hear immediately but that it is difficult to comprehend upon hearing. Another interpretation holds that the keepers of the scriptures in the Mysterious Capital do not permit immediate hearing, so one must return once more to the presence of the Primordial Most High, ascending again to the Nine Heavens to pay homage to the Supreme Worthy and acknowledge the rites of prohibition and precepts.\n\n*zī* (谘) has been explained previously—it means to inquire about the celestial statutes, prohibitions, precepts, and the rites of transmitting and receiving the Dharma. *jìn* (禁) refers to prohibitions; *jiè* (戒) to precepts.\n\n\"Humbly acknowledging their inadequacy\" does not mean they could not uphold the prohibitions and precepts but is a gesture of humility. Though their bodies were divine and perfected, they had not yet penetrated the treasure of the true scriptures. Upon hearing them at once, their wisdom and insight were insufficient—this is precisely the reverence the Elder Thearchs of Heaven and Earth and the Five Thearchs hold for the Dao and its teachings. It is not self-limitation but an admission of unworthiness to receive them.\n\nAll things under heaven possess principle and may hear the Dao—thus the four numinous creatures each excel in their domain. Humans are the most numinous of the myriad beings, and spirits rank among the finest of the kalpic worlds. How could they be incapable of hearing the Dao?\n\nThus, when Yanzi daily received the teachings of the Master, he did not depart from them, appearing as if foolish, yet rejoicing in understanding. After standing firm, he said, \"Though I wish to follow, there is no way.\" When Mañjuśrī transmitted the true essence of the Buddha’s Dharma to Śākyamuni, those who heard it were filled with awe.\n\nThis passage conveys the same meaning. Those who hold this scripture and comprehend the intent of the Elder Thearchs of Heaven and Earth and the Five Thearchs in humbly exalting its purport have thereby understood the Dao.\n\n**The Nine Chapters of Divine Incantations**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy, his compassionate countenance moved to instruction, opened the numinous barrier, and commanded the Five Elder Thearchs to unseal the Cavern of Yang within the Jade Palace of Primordial Clarity. They unfurled the ninefold radiance and eightfold hues of cloud-brocade wrappings to reveal the *True Writ of the Primordial Numinous Treasure’s Vermilion Script on Jade Tablets*, inscribed in gold and carved in jade—subtle, wondrous, and profoundly secret. Through it, the cosmos is governed, and the *Jade Stanzas of the Great Illuminating Perfect Mahā-Mantra of Vast Spiritual Power* were proclaimed and bestowed upon the Five Elder Thearchs.\n\nThereupon, the Five Elder Thearchs received the scripture with reverence, and all the divine sages of the heavens bowed their heads in homage to the Heavenly Worthy and Jade Emperor. Gazing upward, they reverently upheld the Dao’s decree and transmitted it according to the dharma.\n\nThough the Five Elder Thearchs and the perfected sages had already humbly acknowledged their unworthiness, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, his great compassion stirred, again instructed them with solemn admonition. The numinous barrier opened wide in transformation, and he commanded the Five Elder Thearchs to unseal the Cavern of Primordial Yang within the Jade Palace of Mystic Heaven. They unfurled the ninefold rosy clouds and eightfold luminous hues of cloud-brocade wrappings to reveal the *True Writ of the Primordial Numinous Treasure’s Vermilion Script on Jade Tablets*, inscribed in gold and carved in jade—profound, subtle, wondrous, and recondite in its secret and mysterious essence. Through it, all worlds and the cosmos are governed and transformed, and the *Jade Stanzas of the Infinite Great Illuminating Perfect Mahā-Mantra of Vast Spiritual Power* were proclaimed and bestowed upon the Five Elder Thearchs.\n\nThereupon, the Five Elder Thearchs received this dharma in full, and all the divine sages of the heavens bowed their heads in homage to the Heavenly Worthy and Jade Emperor. Gazing upward, they reverently upheld the decree of the Primordial Dao and transmitted it to the divine and human beings of all realms according to the golden rules of this scripture’s orthodox dharma.\n\n*Minyu* (愍谕): \"Compassionate instruction.\" *Min* (愍) signifies great compassion.\n\n\"Yu (谕) means 'to open and guide.' Some say it should be written as 'harmonious and joyful countenance,' but this is incorrect. The numinous barrier swings wide open. The celestial realm where the scriptures are stored—the cinnabar-spirit and mysterious gate—stands vast and unobstructed, flung open in its entirety. One interpretation holds that the sacred heart is laid bare, the mind opened to reveal sincerity. Another says the sacred eyes stream forth radiance, and the numinous barrier swings wide. Both are valid.\n\n*Deng ming* (登命): To summon and appoint. Here, the Five Elder Thearchs are advanced and brought near to receive the command in person.\n\nThe *Jade Hall of Cavernous Yang* is the *Mystic Hall of the Nine Heavens*—a realm of boundless openness, of eternal brightness without shadow. It is not built of tiles, stone, earth, or wood, but of wondrous scenes of dark radiance, its intricate patterns of coiled script intertwining like jade inscriptions. Hence it is so called.\n\nThe *Nine Lights* have been explained earlier. The *Eight Colors* are: profound azure, profound crimson, profound yellow, profound white, profound black, verdant green, jade green, and purple-gold.\n\n*Yun* (韫) refers to the repository where the scriptures are stored—a place where boundless dark radiance is wholly contained.\n\n*Pi* (披) means 'to open or unfurl.' The *Cloud-Silk Satchel* is woven from the brocade of celestial clouds and mist, a natural manifestation of the Dao’s transforming light, not the handiwork of the Weaver Maid of Heaven. That which has a base is called a *satchel*, and the scriptures are inscribed within it. Its depths are unfathomable to all gods, hence the description. It is not to be compared to the cloth, silk, leather, or hides of the mortal realm.\n\nThe phrases from *Numinous Treasure* through *cosmos* have been explained earlier.\n\n*Great Illumination*: The true scriptures of the Three Teachings are all called *Dharma-Treasures*, and wherever they reside, there is radiance. The scriptures of other teachings have limited light, but this *August Scripture* pervades the three thousand great thousand worlds, its efficacy inexhaustible even after kalpas of time. Thus it is called *Great Illumination*.\n\n*Perfect and Complete*: The sacred heart’s compassion and salvation are boundless. Where power falls short—where there are limits or deficiencies, where the lower realms of the Northern Lu Continent cannot be transformed, nor the beings of the Heaven of Free Mastery—it cannot be called *perfect and complete*. The *August Scripture* encompasses all dharmas, unifies all vehicles, and its transformative power is measureless and inexhaustible. Though it is said that the Dao does not force itself nor clamor insistently, its transformative influence arises naturally. All beings, in their cycles of beginning and end, are ultimately transformed by the Dao. Thus it is called *perfect and complete*.\n\n*The Jade Stanzas of the Divine Mantra*: The essential principles of all true dharma lineages, the mysterious secrets of all gods, the pivotal teachings for delivering the world. All divine powers of all teachings derive from this—none surpass its revered and peerless stature. Hence it is so called.\n\nOne reflection: When human nature awakens to the Dao, even after eons, it is not forgotten—like a satchel holding its contents without leak. The moment of awakening is like the mouth of the satchel, hence the scriptural reference to the *satchel*.\n\n*Heavenly Worthy*: Some connect this to the preceding phrase, reading it as *paying homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy*. Others connect it to the following phrase, reading it as *the Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy of all heavens*. The latter interpretation is preferable. The rest has been explained earlier.\"\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\n**The Divine Incantations: Ten Chapters**\n\nAt this time, the divine incantations and decrees bestowed upon the Azure Elder of the Eastern Peace-Jewel Flower Grove, the Green Spirit and Primordial Emperor, were as follows:\n\n**The Nine Qi of the East:**\nThe Primordial August Azure Heaven,\nVerdant mists in layered splendor—\nWithin dwells the Ancient One,\nWho oversees the registers and charts,\nGathers qi, and elevates the immortals.\n\nThe twenty-four secret characters of the Azure Emperor’s *Register of Transcendents* are inscribed upon the Mystic Terrace of the Nine Heavens, governing the summoning of the Nine Heavenly Thearchs and the verification of the divine immortals’ registers.\n\n**Jupiter assists the liver;**\n**Horn and Neck guard the true.**\n**Root and Chamber, Heart and Tail—**\n**The four seasons revolve in cycles.**\n**Winnowing Basket governs the seven luminaries,**\n**Aligning the Dipper and brightening its wheel.**\n**Receiving qi, it seizes the false,**\n**Sweeping away calamitous multitudes.**\n\nThe thirty-two secret characters of the *Star-Restraining Text* are inscribed in the Eastern Florescence Hall of the Purple Tenuity Palace, governing the summoning of stellar officials and the rectification of celestial divisions.\n\n**The Eastern Mountain Divine Incantation**\nSummons the Nine Heavens,\nWith vermilion-script talismanic decrees—\nIt commands Feng Mountain,\nBinds demons and dispatches ghosts,\nAnd none slain by it escape.\nAll hasten to the Wooden Palace;\nDare any delay?\n\nThe thirty-two secret characters of the *Demon-Restraining Text* are inscribed in the Mystic Numinous Lodge of Eastern Florescence, governing the subjugation of ghosts and demons and the rectification of the Nine Heavens’ qi.\n\n**Below, it restrains the Eastern River,**\n**The water spirits of the vast seas.**\n**In great kalpas of flood and disaster,**\n**Dragons bear their forms.**\n**The Water Palace opens its paths,**\n**With myriad routes and a thousand thoroughfares.**\n**The Thearch’s vermilion script—**\n**Wind and fire know no interval.**\n\nThe thirty-two secret characters of the *Water-Restraining Text* are inscribed upon the Cinnabar Terrace of the Jade Tower in the northeast of the Nine Heavens, governing the subjugation of the Eastern Sea’s Water Thearch, the great kalpas of flood and disaster, and the summoning of dragons and water spirits.\n\nThe true text of the *Nine Qi Numinous Treasure Jade Chapters of the East* comprises one hundred twenty characters in total. All are the spontaneous, empty, and luminous writings of the Most High, the Unsurpassed, the Great Illuminating, and Perfectly Complete Divine Incantations. It is also named the *Chapter of Cavernous Mystery for Preserving the True and Generating the Divine*, the *Eastern Mountain Divine Incantation*, and the *Eight Might Strategies of the Azure Emperor*.\n\nBy decree of the Jade Emperor, these are bestowed upon the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord, the Azure Elder of the Eastern Peace-Jewel Flower Grove, the Green Spirit and Primordial Emperor, commanding him to govern all heavens and earths of the East, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the sacred mountains and numinous grottoes, the water palaces and spring abodes, the lofty and venerable perfected ones, the transcendents, sages, and all numinous hosts. Wherever the talismanic decree reaches, it shall be obeyed as an imperial command.\n\nBy the Jade Emperor’s reverent observance of the Dao’s decree, the true scriptures and divine incantations are transmitted in accordance with the law—what is the meaning of this? The Five Elder Thearchs take the Eastern Thearch as their chief. The East embodies the virtue of Wood. The divine mandate bestowed upon the Azure Elder of the Eastern Peace-Jewel Flower Grove is as follows:\n\nThe six phrases from *\"The Eastern Nine Qi\"* to *\"Upholding Qi to Ascend as Transcendents\"* comprise the secret numinous writ of the Azure Thearch for delivering the world and rescuing humanity, recording the registers of transcendents—twenty-four characters inscribed upon the Primordial Terrace of the Nine Heavens, governing the summoning of the Nine Heavenly Thearchs and the verification of transcendent registers. All are the arcane, esoteric speech of the immortals, not to be minutely explicated.\n\nThe eight phrases from *\"The Year Star Assists the Liver\"* to *\"Sweeping Away Calamitous Multitudes\"* comprise the secret writ of stellar regulation—thirty-two characters inscribed within the Eastern Florescence Hall of the Purple Tenuity Palace, governing the summoning of the Stellar Lord of Wood Virtue to rectify the celestial divisions.\n\nThe eight phrases from *\"The Eastern Divine Incantation\"* to *\"Dare There Be Delay\"* comprise the secret writ for subduing the demons of the East—thirty-two characters inscribed within the Mystic Numinosity Lodge of Eastern Florescence, governing the restraint of demonic spirits and the rectification of the Nine Qi of all Eastern realms.\n\nThe eight phrases from *\"Below, Commanding the Eastern Rivers\"* to *\"Wind and Fire Without Interval\"* comprise the secret writ for the waters of the East—thirty-two characters inscribed upon the Cinnabar Terrace of the Jade Tower in the Northeast of the Nine Heavens, governing the restraint of the Eastern Sea’s Water Thearch, the great kalpic deluges, and the summoning of flood dragons and water deities.\n\nThe *True Writ of the Nine Qi Numinous Treasure Red Script Jade Chapter of the East*, totaling one hundred twenty characters, is the Great Divine Incantation of the Utmost Supreme, Great Illuminating, and Perfectly Complete, the spontaneously self-existent scripture of the Cavernous Mystery. It is also named the *Chapter of Cavernous Mystery for Preserving the True and Generating the Divine* and the *Eight Might Strategies of the Azure Emperor*. The above cannot be explicated; thus, the original text is transcribed again.\n\nBy the Jade Emperor’s decree, these are bestowed upon the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord, the Azure Elder of the Eastern Peace-Jewel Flower Grove. Commanding him to govern all heavens and earths of the East, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the sacred mountains and numinous grottoes, the water springs and transcendents, sages, and all numinous hosts. Wherever the talismanic decree reaches, it shall be obeyed as an imperial command. Should it be harmonized, the heavens, earth, and waters of the East, and all divine spirits, shall reverently comply with this mandate, none failing to act accordingly.\n\nThis arcane chapter is the great secret of the Azure Numinosity of heaven, earth, and all beings. Demons and ghosts lose their courage; kalpas are transcended, and calamities averted. All sages dare not disobey, and thus it eternally guards the Eastern realms.\n\n**Eleven Chapters of Divine Incantations**\nThe divine incantation and mandate bestowed upon the Vermilion Elder of the Southern Flourishing Yang and Cinnabar Numinosity:\n\nThe Southern Vermilion Heaven, the Jade Hall of the Vermilion Thearch, wherein resides the Great Spirit,\nTitled the Vermilion Sovereign.\nAbove, flames flow like smoke, the Three Qi blazing with light.\nTranscendents receive their mandate, responding to the Great Yang.\n\nThe secret writ of the Vermilion Thearch for recording transcendents—thirty-two characters inscribed within the Cavernous Yang Lodge of the Nine Heavens, governing the summoning of the registers of transcendent names inscribed in gold.\n\nMars assists the heart; the Well and Ghost constellations guard the chambers. The Willow, Star, Spread, and Wings constellations\ngovern the four directions.\n\nThe Seven Mansions of the Chariot govern the celestial cycles, summoning and hastening conjunctions, rectifying the Dao’s courier paths.\n\nThe right-hand star-controlling secret writ of thirty-two characters is inscribed upon the Threefold Radiance Cinnabar Terrace, governing the summoning of stellar officials, clarifying celestial measures, and rectifying the divisions of the southern heavens.\n\nThe vermilion script commands the numinous, seizing the northern Mount Feng, binding and dispatching demonic lineages, severing evil and extirpating its roots. The talismanic teachings prosecute, exposing the origins of transgressions. The Southern Mountain divine incantation subdues the eight directions with awe. All demons are annihilated, myriad trials obliterated.\n\nThe right-hand demon-controlling secret writ of forty characters is inscribed upon the Western-Southern Yang Upright Jade Portal, governing the restraint of northern Feng, rectifying ghostly qi.\n\nThe Southern River Water Thearch, the Great Elder Dragon King—his divine incantation flows forth, universally sweeping away inauspiciousness. Floodwaters and flying calamities are stilled; dragons are summoned and flood dragons restrained. Waterways are opened, a thousand paths and ten thousand passages unobstructed. Should any dare to test this, they shall be seized and dispatched to the Fire Palace. None disobey the proclamations of the vermilion script.\n\nThe right-hand water-controlling secret writ of forty-eight characters is inscribed upon the Western-Southern Yang Upright Jade Portal, governing the seizing of the Southern River Water Thearch, the great conjunctions of cosmic cycles, the bursting forth of floodwaters in all directions, and the summoning of flood dragons and water spirits.\n\n*The Numinous Treasure Vermilion Script Jade Chapters of the Southern Three Qi*, comprising one hundred fifty-two characters in total, are all the peerless, supreme, great luminous, perfect, and divine incantations of the self-so Void Cavern, also named *The Southern Clouds Pervading Heaven Treasure Scripture*, *The Peerless Supreme Incantation of the Nine Heavens*, and *The Vermilion Thearch’s Eightfold Might Strategems*.\n\nThe right-hand Jade Thearch’s mandate is bestowed upon the Vermilion Elder of the Southern Flourishing Yang and Cinnabar Numinosity, the Three Qi Heavenly Lord, commanding him to govern all heavens, lands, sun, moon, and stellar lodges of the southern quadrant, its sacred mountains and numinous caverns, water palaces and spring abodes, exalted sages, perfected transcendents, and all numinous powers. Wherever the talismanic mandate reaches, it is to be obeyed as a sacred edict.\n\nThe eastern writ has forever secured the eastern quadrant. What, then, is the divine incantation and mandate bestowed upon the Vermilion Elder of the Southern Flourishing Yang and Cinnabar Numinosity?\n\nThe eight lines from *The Southern Vermilion Heaven* to *responding to the Great Yang* constitute the transcendent-recording secret writ of the Vermilion Thearch, thirty-two characters inscribed within the Cavernous Yang Lodge of the Nine Heavens, governing the summoning of the registers of transcendent names inscribed in gold.\n\nThe eight lines from *Mars assists the heart* to *rectifying the Dao’s courier paths* constitute the star-controlling secret writ, thirty-two characters inscribed upon the Three Qi Cinnabar Terrace, governing the summoning of stellar officials, clarifying the celestial measures of the southern heavens, and rectifying the astrological divisions of the southern quadrant.\n\nThe ten lines from *The vermilion script commands the numinous* to *myriad trials obliterated* constitute the demon-controlling secret writ of forty characters, inscribed upon the Western-Southern Yang Upright Jade Portal, governing the restraint of northern Feng and the rectification of ghostly qi.\n\nThe twelve lines from *The Southern River Water Thearch* to *none disobey* constitute the water-controlling secret writ of forty-eight characters, inscribed upon the Western-Southern Yang Upright Jade Portal, governing the seizing of the Southern River Water Thearch, the great conjunctions of cosmic cycles, the bursting forth of floodwaters in all directions, and the summoning of flood dragons and water spirits.\n\nThe one hundred fifty-two characters of the Southern Three Qi true writ are all the supreme, luminous, perfect, and great divine incantations of the self-so Void Cavern, also named *The Southern Clouds Pervading Heaven Treasure Scripture*, *The Peerless Supreme Incantation of the Nine Heavens*, and *The Vermilion Thearch’s Eightfold Might Strategems*.\n\nThe right-hand Jade Thearch’s mandate is bestowed upon the Vermilion Elder of the Southern Flourishing Yang, the Three Qi Heavenly Lord, now commanding him to govern all heavens, lands, sun, moon, and stellar lodges of the southern quadrant, its mountains, caverns, springs, exalted transcendents, sages, and all numinous powers. Wherever the talismanic mandate reaches, it is to be obeyed as a sacred edict.\n\nThe transcendent-recording writ governs all worlds of the southern quadrant. The star-controlling writ governs all heavens of the southern quadrant. The demon-controlling writ governs all demons of the southern quadrant’s heavens, lands, and beings. The water-controlling writ governs all water thearchs and numinous entities of the southern quadrant. All the above writs governing the southern quadrant encompass all worlds of the southern direction, enduring through kalpas, eternally securing them. Even the great sages of the Three Teachings cannot transgress them.\n\nThe mysterious chapters are too sacred to be expounded. The original text is repeated to demonstrate reverence for their profound secrecy. By employing this to discipline the heart, one attains its secrets. Through devout recitation and silent contemplation, all shall witness its supreme efficacy.\n\n**Divine Incantations, Chapter Twelve**\nThe divine incantation and mandate bestowed upon the Central Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Primordial Elder Yellow Thearch:\n\nThe Central Primordial Numinous governs the Yellow Supreme Heavenly Origin, first engendering the Five Elders, the exalted Central Yellow. It seizes qi to oversee the perfected, universally leading the host of transcendents, presiding over the mysterious registers, the stellar records inscribed in jade, hastening the ascent of primordial qi, and universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits.\n\nThe right-hand transcendent-recording secret writ of the Yellow Thearch, forty characters inscribed upon the Great Mystery Jade Treasure Mysterious Astral Lodge, governs the summoning of transcendents, jade tablets, stellar destinies, and the comprehensive transcendent registers.\n\nSaturn assists the spleen, revolving to measure the northern origin. The Demon Star, Ghost, and Ladle govern transgressions, severing evil and extirpating its roots. Demons of the mountain, the wandering, the castrated, and the auxiliary sweep away defilement and disperse miasmas. The Net and Dipper rectify the mysterious, clarifying the celestial passes. The Nine Heavens’ talismanic mandates are transmitted by the Golden Horse Couriers.\n\nThe right-hand star-controlling secret writ of forty characters is inscribed upon the Jade Terrace of the Mysterious Capital, governing the seizing of stellar officials and rectifying celestial divisions and measures.\n\nThe Central Yellow governs primordial qi, universally seizing the boundless. Saturn radiates splendor, refining the numinous palaces. It commands and seizes the Northern Thearch, blocking the gates of ghosts. Inauspiciousness is eradicated, none daring to stand before it.\n\nThe right-hand demon-controlling secret writ of thirty-two characters is inscribed upon the Jade Terrace of the Mysterious Capital, governing the seizing of the Northern Thearch, rectifying celestial qi, and restraining ghostly essences.\n\nThe Central Mountain divine incantation summons dragons to ascend the clouds, governing the confluence of the Yellow River and the nine water sources. No negligence or indulgence is permitted; good and evil are thoroughly distinguished. A thousand demons and ten thousand deceits are reported to the Thearch.

Wherever the talismanic commands reach, they shall be obeyed as decreed.\n\nThe Writs for Delivering Humans and Registering Transcendents, for Controlling Stars, Demons, and Water, encompass all the secrets of the Northern Mystery. Thus, none may ever transgress them.\n\nUpon bestowing the True Writs of the Five Directions and Five Thearchs, they eternally guard all worlds. The Three Teachings and myriad beings cannot escape their sway; they endure for eternal kalpas, wondrously existing in the void, their mysteries unfathomable. Profound beyond profundity, their divinity is divine indeed.\n\nThe five qi of my own body fully embody this principle. Those of resolve and understanding, who penetrate the essence of life and destiny and grasp the source of the myriad dharmas, cannot be contravened by principles or numerology. The True Scripture is ever within me; the efficacy and transformation of the divine incantations reside herein.\n\n**Fifteen Incantation Chapters**\nThe Dao speaks: These Great Divine Incantations are the wondrous words of the Primordial Commencement, the true decrees of the Jade Thearch, the numinous writs spontaneously generated by the Supreme Purity, the mysterious writs born at the inception of the Nine Heavens, the numinous chapters of the Hollow Cavern, the secret utterances of the loftiest sages, the exalted canon of the Jade Capital. They establish heaven and earth, unfold the myriad transformations, pacify spirits and secure the numinous, engender and complete the multitudes, rectify and govern the cosmic cycles, and preserve the heavens’ eternal endurance. Above, they control the mechanisms of heaven; at the center, they regulate the five numina; below, they command the earthly deities. They command the sources of rivers, mobilize yin and yang, summon spirits and dispatch transcendents—this is the wondrous subtlety of the utmost truth.\n\nMoreover, their divine responses arise spontaneously, causing the heavens to soar and clear, the earth to stand firm and secure, and the Five Marchmounts to be safeguarded, wherein the myriad beings abide.\n\nWhy are the divine transformations of the Five Directions’ incantations boundless?\nThe Dao speaks: These Great Divine Incantations are the wondrous words of the Most Supreme Primordial Commencement Thearch, the precious decrees of the Most True Jade Thearch, the numinous writs spontaneously generated by the Supreme Purity Mysterious Capital, the mysterious celestial writs born at the inception of the Nine Heavens’ immortal realms, the numinous chapters of the Great Void and Hollow Cavern, the secret utterances of the Most Supreme and Peerless Loftiest Sages, the most exalted dharma canon of the Purple Ultimate Jade Capital. Above, they perfect the myriad heavens; below, they establish the myriad earths. They unfold the wondrous transformations of the myriad existences, unify the spirits, and secure the myriad numina. In their singular generation and completion, they govern the billions of beings, uphold and assist the secrets of cosmic cycles and deliverance, and preserve the eternal endurance of the heavens. Above, they control the great generative mechanisms of the celestial canopy; at the center, they regulate the Five Directions’ five numina; below, they command the earthly deities. They command all water palaces and river sources, transform and mobilize yin and yang, and summon all spirits and transcendents. These Great Divine Incantations are the wondrous writs of the utmost truth, whose divine transformations and wondrous responses arise solely from spontaneity.\n\nAbove, they abide in Heaven, attaining the One to achieve purity—lofty, luminous, and enduring, thus establishing Heaven’s towering clarity. Below, they abide in Earth, attaining the One to achieve tranquility—vast, profound, and enduring, thus establishing Earth’s steadfast constancy. They eternally pacify and secure the Five Peaks and renowned mountains, ensuring the perpetual existence of all myriad beings and their kinds.\n\nThe Dao declares: It is the Five Venerable Thearchs who expound the Dao and offer praises, hence the attribution to the Primordial Jade Sovereign—this is not the Primordial’s self-praise. The wondrous and numinous scriptures mentioned here have all been explained previously.\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Primordial Mysterious Writs* are called \"writs\" as they are inscribed by hand. The *True Scripture of the Jade Sovereign* is formless and soundless, its radiant light and wondrous tones pervading the ten directions and the entire Dharma Realm, enduring through kalpas without decay. It is not something that can be inscribed by hand—all is the spontaneous script; not something that can be transmitted by speech—all is the wondrousness of mind-to-mind transmission. Sought in the beginningless, it exists prior to the formless in the Great Void, hence it is called the *Nine Heavens’ Primordial Mysterious Writs*.\n\nThe *Venerable Canon of the Jade Palace*—the \"palace\" is where the Son of Heaven resides. The Primordial is the supreme honor of all teachings, dwelling in the Sacred Realm of Jade Purity, whose mysterious transformations are inexhaustible, hence it is called the *Jade Palace*. In expounding this true scripture, none of the teachings’ scriptures compare; none of the sages or spirits dare defy it. The celestial statutes and golden registers treasure it most profoundly; the saints of the ten directions guard it most strictly, hence it is called the *Venerable Canon*.\n\nTo \"pacify the spirits\" is to command all spirits to refrain from displaying their numinous powers, remaining serene and non-active. To \"secure the numina\" is to command all numina to conceal their spiritual resonance, restraining their majestic efficacy. To \"uphold and assist the cycles of deliverance\" is to govern the kalpas from beginning to end throughout the Dharma Realm, holding the turning of kalpas and the boundless deliverance, ensuring their cyclical perpetuity without decline or wavering.\n\nTo \"command the earthly deities\" is to issue decrees and edicts—this is not the \"whip\" of coercion. To \"mobilize and employ yin and yang\" means that the Dao truly governs their alternation, hence it is called \"mobilizing and employing\"—this does not refer to commanding yin ghosts or yang spirits. To \"summon the spirits\" is to gather and call forth all spirits. To \"employ the transcendents\"—though transcendents are the guests of the Thearch, why speak of \"employing\" them? When the Primordial expounded this scripture, it became the true essence of the Three Teachings, and all spirits reverently complied, hence it is called \"employing the transcendents.\"\n\nHeaven and Earth may perish, and the myriad kinds may come to an end—how then can it be said that all beings endure? From kalpa to kalpa, generation after generation is inexhaustible, all relying on the Great Dao, hence it is said that all beings endure.\n\n**The Sixteen Chapters of the Divine Incantations**\nwere once bestowed by the Jade Sovereign upon the Five Venerable Thearchs. At that time, the Five Thearchs knelt and reverently held the chapters, secretly inscribing them in the numinous capital. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign once transcribed the text, enshrining it in the Supreme Clarity’s True Realm, the Great Mystery’s Jade Capital, the Cold Numinous Cinnabar Hall, and the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace. Through countless kalpas and cosmic cycles, the text has preserved the celestial root, remaining uncorrupted and undiminished, evolving in tandem with the turning of kalpas.\n\nThis Great Divine Incantation, when confounded, remains unstained; when defiled, grows ever purer. When destroyed, it does not perish; when extinguished, it shines with utmost clarity. The scripture of the Great Existence is revered by the Heavenly Perfected, its true name resplendent with celestial radiance. The Thearch’s chart is inscribed upon golden tablets, illuminating future generations. This scripture is profoundly hidden and secret—ordinary beings cannot glimpse or hear of it. Those who attain this Dao preserve the eternal endurance of the myriad qi. Through diligent practice and devotion, they attain transcendence and ascend to pay homage to the Most Honored Thearch.\n\nTo \"kneel and hold\" is to prostrate and reverently cradle the treasure chapters. The scripture exists in Heaven as a mysterious text, not a worldly one—how then can it be \"held by hand\"? The celestial spirits bow and hold it in utmost reverence. To \"secretly inscribe\" is to praise and transcribe it. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign’s transcription of the scripture consists of celestial radiance and heavenly writ, golden and jade characters forming wondrous texts a *zhang* in length.\n\nThe *True Realm of Supreme Clarity* is the abode of the Numinous Treasure. The scripture was originally expounded by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and transmitted by the Numinous Treasure, hence it is called the *True Realm of Supreme Clarity*. That \"its text preserves the celestial root\" means the principle of the scripture endures through kalpas without decay—it preserves the eternal constancy of the celestial mystery. Some interpret this as preserving the root of Heaven to ensure its perpetuity, but this is incorrect. After the cosmic cycles, Heaven cannot endure eternally, so it cannot refer to the root of Heaven. \"Evolving in tandem with the turning of kalpas\" means it endures through kalpa after kalpa.\n\n\"When confounded, it remains unstained\" means that even when mixed with heterodox teachings, the true Dao persists and cannot taint this scripture. \"When defiled, it grows ever purer\" means that those who profane this scripture are punished by Heaven, revealing its ever-greater sanctity and purity. \"When destroyed, it does not perish\" means that even when foolish and perverse beings slander and destroy this scripture, it remains indestructible. \"When extinguished, it shines with utmost clarity\" means that in an age without the Dao, those who seek to extinguish this scripture will only cause its teachings to spread widely, revealing its ever-greater luminosity.\n\nThe \"scripture of the Great Existence\" endures through kalpas, present everywhere—it is not an ordinary phenomenon but a wondrous existence, hence it is called the *Great Existence*. Some interpret this as the scripture of the *Great Existence* and the *Court*, but this is overly restrictive.\n\nRevealing the future lives, it speaks not of one person’s rebirth but of the myriad lives to come. Those who cannot glimpse or hear of it are not the utmost sages, for common folk merely recite its words. Demons dare not peer into it, and the benighted cannot comprehend it. Those who grasp the principles within this scripture preserve the eternal flow of my myriad *qi*, diligently cultivating and revering it, and thus ascend to immortality, paying homage to the Supreme Emperor. Some say it is homage to the Five Elder Lords, but this is overly restrictive. Another interpretation holds that it preserves the eternal *qi* of the myriad transformations, which is also valid. This speaks to the scripture’s manifest efficacy.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Jade Emperor’s Virtues and Powers**\n*Continuation of the \"Virtues and Powers\" Chapter, Eighteenth Section Following the Previous Seventeen*\n\nAt that time, the Jade Void Emperor addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"I earnestly wish for your compassion to universally benefit the Four Assemblies, Lord Śakra, the Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings, all the devas, all the immortals, and all future beings, as well as those who uphold this scripture, by expounding its beneficial matters.\"\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke to the Jade Void Emperor: \"Excellent indeed is this question! How good it is! You, moved by compassion, take pity on sentient beings and thus inquire of me. You should resume your seat, and I shall proclaim and expound.\"\n\nWhen the Jade Emperor bestowed this scripture upon the Five Elder Lords, the Heavenly Emperor of the Jade Void Heaven ascended to address the Great Heavenly Worthy, Master of Scriptures and Teachings: \"I earnestly wish for your utmost sagely compassion to universally benefit the Four Assemblies of the world, all the deva-kings such as Lord Śakra, the Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings above the Three Realms, all the devas, all ranks of immortals, all future beings, and those who uphold this true scripture, by expounding its beneficial matters.\"\n\nAt that time, the Great Heavenly Worthy, Master of Scriptures, addressed the Jade Void Emperor: \"How joyous indeed is this question! How good it is! You, moved by a heart of compassion, take pity on the beings of the world and thus inquire of me. You should resume your seat, and I shall proclaim and expound the scripture’s meaning.\"\n\nWhen the Heavenly Worthy refers to the Primordial Beginning, it is not the Jade Emperor. The Four Assemblies have been explained previously. Lord Śakra is the lord of the devas, including all buddhas and bodhisattvas of the Buddhist teachings. Some hold that all heavenly lords are called Śakra, which is also correct. If one takes *Śakra* to mean the lord of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, this is a misconception of the Buddhist tradition. The scriptures do not mistakenly refer to the lord of heaven as the Jade Emperor, for the Jade Emperor is the ancestor of the myriad heavens, not merely the lord of a single heaven. The Buddhist scriptures state that Brahmā and Śakra present auspicious signs, speaking of the ancestral figures of heaven and buddhahood, not presuming to mention the Jade Emperor. Monks who indulge in private misinterpretations commit a grave error. Thus, this is mentioned here as well.\n\nThe Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings are the great Brahmā kings above the Three Realms, not the kings of the lower heavens of the Desire Realm. To speak of Brahmā Heaven is to encompass the upper realms. The *zhongmin* heavens and their denizens are not mentioned, for above the *zhongmin* are the perfected great immortals who naturally accord with this scripture, hence they are not included. \"All the devas\" and \"all the immortals\" refer to all the heavenly lords, divine beings, and people, as well as all ranks of immortals below Brahmā Heaven.\n\nThe question of beneficial matters: The Great Dao does not speak of efficacy, so why does the Jade Void Emperor request an explanation of its benefits? The Great Dao is the ancestor of heaven, earth, and all beings, inherently possessing true benefits and natural advantages for humanity. Those among the Four Assemblies of heaven and earth who do not know this scripture are ignorant of its meaning, dare not believe in it, and thus slight the great Dharma, misleading themselves. The Great Dao, in its benevolent compassion, cannot bear the world’s delusion and thus speaks of benefits to deliver beings. How is it that the foolish and deluded still claim this scripture consists of subtle words and abstruse theories, of what benefit is it to people? Do they not know that this scripture gives rise to heaven, earth, and all beings, and cannot be separated from for even a moment? Everywhere, everyone should recite and uphold it, passing it down through kalpas, for it brings great benefits naturally, not merely to entice people with effects.\n\n\"How good it is!\" is not a question but an affirmation of the excellence of the inquiry. \"I\" refers to the Primordial Beginning speaking of himself. \"You\" refers to the Primordial Beginning addressing the Jade Void Emperor. \"Resume your seat\" instructs the Jade Void Emperor to return to his seat for listening to the scripture. \"I\" is also the Primordial Beginning referring to himself. \"Proclaim and expound\" means to broadly disseminate as proclamation and to explain as discourse.\n\n*Fan* (梵) is pronounced *fu* (扶), not mistakenly as *fan* (梵). This expresses the sincerity of the request for the scripture and the heart of universal benefit.\n\n*Continuation of the \"Virtues and Powers\" Chapter, Eighteenth Section*\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"If in the Three Realms, the ten directions, and the boundless lands, warfare erupts, pestilence spreads, floods, droughts, locusts, or dire calamities and famines arise, then the king and his ministers should arouse compassion and, for the sake of their people, issue decrees throughout the land, ordering the governors of provinces, counties, and towns to command all Daoist followers to purify and adorn their oratories. There, they shall hold grand fasts and jiao rites, perform the six-hour circumambulation, and recite this scripture. Thus, the land shall attain peace, the five grains shall ripen abundantly, and the people shall live in tranquility.\"\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy, having instructed the Jade Void Emperor to resume his seat and listen to the scripture, then said: \"If in the Three Realms of heaven, earth, and humanity, the ten directions of the four cardinal and four intermediate directions, and the boundless lands, warfare erupts and weapons clash, or celestial disasters spread and pestilence rages, or years of scarcity bring floods, droughts, locusts, dire calamities, and famine, then the king and his ministers should arouse compassion for their people and issue decrees throughout the land. The governors of provinces, counties, and towns shall command all Daoist followers to purify and adorn their oratories. There, they shall hold grand fasts and jiao rites, perform the six-hour circumambulation, and recite this true scripture. Thus, the land shall attain peace, the five grains shall ripen abundantly, and the people shall live in tranquility.\"\n\nSome say that the Three Realms cannot include heaven, fearing conflict with the term *weapons*. Yet even heavenly demons contend with the lords of the heavens, engaging in battles within their respective domains. Thus, the Three Realms indeed encompass heaven, earth, and humanity.\"\n\nWhen warfare arises, it refers only to conflicts breaking out in various regions, with mutual hostilities—it does not mean that both \"weapons\" and \"halberds\" emerge simultaneously. Swords, spears, and the like are all weapons, including halberds and polearms. Thus, it is incorrect to speak of their concurrent emergence. Some say that \"soldiers rise as men, and men and halberds arise together,\" but this is also not the proper meaning.\n\nWhen pestilential qi spreads widely, the heavenly Dao remains in its constant state, while calamities are called \"changes.\" The rampant spread of pestilential qi is a time of plague, which is also an inauspicious anomaly. This scripture dispels and averts such afflictions.\n\nFloods and droughts, locusts and insects—overflowing waters, parched lands, various pests harming crops, and swarms of locusts damaging harvests—are all inauspicious anomalies. Dire calamities and famine occur when the year’s harvest fails and the people and creatures are unsettled, making it \"dire.\" The abnormal is called \"calamity.\" Grain failing to ripen is \"famine,\" while vegetables failing to ripen is \"dearth.\" All these are inauspicious anomalies.\n\n黎 refers to the black-haired people; 庶, to the common folk. 遍勑 is synonymous with 遍敕. 州县镇宰 may refer to the officials governing prefectures, counties, and towns who oversee the people, or to military commanders in garrisons. Some say it refers to grand officials like governors and viceroys. All these interpretations are valid.\n\nThus, \"the king and his ministers\" refers to the kings and ministers of such places.\n\nThe Daoist lineages—Quanzhen, Zhengyi, Qingwei, Lingbao, and other schools—maintain purity and solemnity, both inwardly and outwardly, with body and mind undivided. Their altars and vestments are impeccably ordered, their reverence and dignity unwavering from beginning to end. Such is their purity and solemnity.\n\n*Guan* (觀) means \"to observe.\" Where the spirit resides, onlookers are moved to reverence—this is truly a grand spectacle. Hence, it is called *guan*.\n\nWhen grand *zhai* (斋) and *jiao* (醮) rites are conducted, inner and outer realms are aligned, the will of the assembly is unified, and what was discordant is harmonized—this is *zhai*. To beseech and give thanks to the deities, repaying Heaven and Earth, aligning one’s virtue with the divine, and invoking blessings according to ritual—this is *jiao*.\n\nThe \"six periods of Dao-recitation\" do not refer to the modern practice of processional recitation along roads, but rather to invoking the deities, reciting scriptures, and chanting the Dao according to ritual. Some say that of the twelve hours of day and night, odd hours are for activity and even hours for stillness. The \"six periods\" correspond to *zi* (子), *yin* (寅), *chen* (辰), *wu* (午), *shen* (申), and *xu* (戌). Others say they span from *zi* to *si* (巳), or refer to the six daylight hours. All interpretations are valid.\n\nWhen scriptures are recited with the heart in union with the Dao, holding fast to the true scripture, the land knows no hardship, and peace prevails. The five grains—rice, millet, sorghum, beans, and wheat—all ripen in abundance, and the black-haired people of every land and realm are spared from disaster and suffering, forever dwelling in tranquility and joy.\n\n**Chapter on Meritorious Virtues (Continuation of Chapter Nineteen)**\nIf one enters the mountains and forests and encounters venomous or ferocious beasts, merely focusing the mind on a single thought of the true scripture will ensure the mountain spirits guard and protect them, causing the fierce beasts to retreat without harm. If one enters rivers or seas to gather treasures or seek precious things and encounters violent winds that threaten to capsize their vessel, reciting this true scripture according to its prescribed method will instantly still the winds and waves, allowing safe passage to shore. The benefits of the true scripture extend beyond averting heavenly disasters, ensuring bountiful harvests, and bringing peace to the common folk. Even sudden calamities—perils of mountains, waters, winds, and waves—can be rendered harmless.\n\nIf one enters the mountains and forests and encounters venomous or ferocious beasts, merely focusing the mind on a single thought of the true scripture, never forgetting this precious and wondrous dharma, will ensure the mountain spirits guard and protect them, causing the fierce beasts to retreat naturally without harming the scripture-holder. If one enters rivers or seas to gather treasures or seek precious objects and encounters violent winds that drift their vessel, reciting this true scripture according to the method prescribed in the scripture will cause the gale to subside, the waves to still, and the vessel to reach shore safely, with no harm befalling the scripture-holder.\n\nMountains and forests are perilous places, where fierce beasts and venomous creatures cannot be approached. Upon encountering them, one is surely harmed. Yet merely focusing the mind on a single thought of the true scripture—briefly uniting with the Dao—causes the beasts to retreat. This is because all living beings originate from the same primordial *qi*, differing only in purity and turbidity. In the beginning, Heaven and Earth were undivided, and humans and creatures coexisted in harmony, with venomous beasts and ferocious creatures posing no threat. Later, human hearts grew cunning, and they began to harm creatures, provoking creatures to harm them in return. If one consistently does good deeds, maintains a virtuous heart, reveres and believes in the true scripture, and never forgets it, they are a great person of virtue. Entering mountains and forests, they will not encounter venomous creatures or fierce beasts. If an ordinary person without merit enters the mountains and happens upon such creatures, not clinging to life in fear of death, remaining unflustered and unwavering, steadfastly believing in the true dharma, focusing single-mindedly, and silently reciting a thought of the true scripture, their heart will unite with the Dao. The mountain spirits will guard and protect them, and the venomous creatures and fierce beasts will naturally retreat.\n\nCreatures are dull beings within the Dao. Though their natures may be venomous and harmful, each has what they revere, fear, and avoid. Thus, birds of prey honor the phoenix, fierce beasts pay homage to the *lin*, and venomous creatures like snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and millipedes fear storks, cranes, and herons, vanishing without deploying their venom. The immortals and perfected ones understand the mechanisms of life and transformation, the origins of control and restraint. A single incantation or talismanic water can subdue venomous snakes, resolve the perils of tigers, reverse winds, and turn back the heavens. How much more so the *Huangjing*, which is the source of all dharmas and the ancestor of Heaven and Earth? The life and death of all things depend on Heaven and Earth, rooted in the Great Dao. Focusing the mind on a single thought of this scripture, one need not fear creatures. The radiance of the dharma-treasure and the protection of the deities ensure that, though creatures may be dull, their nature reveres the Dao, fears Heaven, and stands in awe of the divine, causing them to retreat naturally.\n\nRivers, lakes, seas, and oceans are perilous places of wind and waves, where Heaven’s wrath seems inescapable. Yet this scripture is the king of all dharmas, and wind, thunder, hail, and lightning are the wondrous manifestations of Heaven’s divine power. Reciting this true scripture according to its method unites one with Heaven and the Dao, causing Heaven to soften its might, the winds to subside, and the waves to still, allowing the vessel to reach shore safely.\n\n**Verification:**\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Treading upon a tiger’s tail, it bites the man—misfortune.\" Confucius said: \"Facing a tiger bare-handed or fording a river—dying without regret.\" Yet this scripture says that focusing the mind on a single thought or reciting it according to its method causes creatures to retreat and winds and waves to still. The *Daodejing* states: \"Those who align with the Dao are not seized by birds of prey, stung by venomous creatures, or gored by tigers or rhinoceroses. Their claws and fangs remain sheathed, and they dare not harm.\" Many doubt that Confucianism and Daoism contradict each other, but consider: When Yu crossed the Yangtze, a yellow dragon lifted its head and departed. When Liu Kun governed Jiangling, he reversed the wind to extinguish a fire, and when he governed Hongnong, tigers crossed the river to the north. When Master Yi crossed the river, his reverence stilled the winds. Thus, the *Book of Changes* and Confucius refer to those who act recklessly without the Dao, while the *Huangjing* and *Daodejing* speak of those who honor the scriptures and align with the Dao.\n\nThe scripture’s merit can even deliver one from the brute realms and sever karmic poisons—how could those who uphold it walk unscathed among venomous creatures? *Chapter on Merits and Virtues, Continued (Chapter Twenty)*\n\nWhen in battle, with polearms locked and blades crossed, silently recite this true scripture with focused mind, and all hostile forces will scatter and disperse. Does the true scripture’s power merely resolve the perils of beasts and storms?\n\nWhen in battle, with weapons raised and polearms engaged, blades clashing between armies, silently recite this true scripture with focused mind, and all hostile forces assaulting you on the field will scatter and disperse.\n\n**Textual Verification:**\nWeapons are instruments of misfortune; halberds, matters of peril. In the heat of charge and defense, arrows and stones flying, blades locked in combat like tigers in mortal struggle—no force can break the deadlock. Yet silently reciting this true scripture, aligning the heart with the Dao, how could hostile forces not retreat?\n\nThe art of war states: \"One can break the morale of an entire army; one can shake the resolve of its general.\" Silent recitation of the true scripture seizes their spirits, strips their courage, and through the scripture’s divine efficacy, the enemy loses heart, their will to kill and fight dissolved. Turning from evil to virtue, they retreat and disperse of their own accord.\n\n\"Army\" here does not refer to the fixed number of twelve thousand five hundred, nor does \"formation\" imply a set battle array. It simply denotes the moment when war is joined and ranks are drawn, the clash of attack. The repetition of \"polearms engaged\" and \"blades crossed\" is not redundant; it merely follows the scripture’s phrasing of \"weapons and blades clashing.\" To silently recite the true scripture is not to seek mere escape from slaughter, but to devote oneself wholeheartedly, even unto death, without straying from the Dao.\n\n\"All\" means the multitude; \"hostile forces\" refers not to \"evil people\" and \"bandit factions\" as separate categories, but simply to rebellious enemies. \"Scatter and disperse\" means to retreat and turn back, to disperse and return to their own.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nWhen Lord Lao transformed the Hu barbarians, the kingdom of Yutian besieged him. When the Heavenly Emperor resided in his celestial palace, the demon kings raised armies to contend with him. When the Buddha was in Kapilavastu, the six kings—Ajātaśatru and others—rebelled. When Confucius taught the world, he was barred from gathering firewood in Chen and erased from records in Song. All were great sages, embodiments of the Dao, manifestations of the Dharma-body, constantly reciting the true scripture. Yet they faced those who sought to harm them.\n\nLater, Lord Lao radiated the light of the Dao, and Yutian submitted. The Emperor manifested celestial radiance, and the demon kings withdrew. The Buddha emanated the light of the Dharma, and the six kings returned to allegiance. Confucius shone with the light of virtue, and when he plucked his zither and sang thrice, the men of Kuang laid down their arms. Thus, the enemies retreated of their own accord.\n\nConsider how many bandits have sworn not to harm the virtuous, and how many good people have faced peril yet survived. Some doubt the efficacy of scriptural merit, citing Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong of Song, who honored the Dao yet suffered humiliation in the northern lands, or Emperor Wu of Liang, who revered the Buddha yet starved to death in Taicheng. Yet these three rulers’ devotion to Dao and Buddha was but a hollow reputation, not true commitment.\n\nWhile the passions and desires remain unsevered, one cannot govern the world through the Dao, hence these calamities arise. If one truly embodies the Dao, steadfastly believing in the power of the scriptures, even a common man or woman may avoid disaster. To doubt the integrity of those who die for righteousness or disbelieve the words of the scriptures is indeed mistaken.\n\nAlas! The praise of unblemished integrity serves to exhort the world; the recounting of scriptural merit serves to inspire people toward goodness. In essence, the scriptures’ purport does not transcend the Dao of one’s own nature and being. When the six thieves of the senses rebel, focusing the mind single-heartedly on the Dao causes the six thieves to withdraw. Thus, when encountering warfare, Heaven resolves the peril. As Lord Lao said: *\"Armor and weapons cannot harm.\"* And Guanyin declared: *\"Blades shatter into fragments of their own accord.\"* Such is the inevitable principle. How could these words deceive us?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One (Continued) of the Meritorious Virtues Section**\nIf one finds oneself in prison or bound by fetters, purify the mind, settle the thoughts, and meditate upon this scripture—wrongful accusations will be redressed, and liberation will be attained. The benefits of this scripture extend far beyond merely causing bandits and soldiers to retreat of their own accord.\n\nIf one has inadvertently committed an offense and is imprisoned or bound in fetters, purify the heart and mind, calm the thoughts, and meditate upon this true scripture—wrongful accusations will naturally be clarified, and liberation will be attained.\n\n**Textual Verification:**\nPrisons are meant to confine the guilty. The principle that virtue brings fortune and vice brings misfortune is the constant Way of Heaven. Once imprisoned for a crime, one cannot be immediately released—how then can it be said that meditating upon this scripture brings liberation? The phrase *\"wrongful accusations will be redressed\"* implies that the person in question must have been inherently good in daily life. Perhaps they bore karmic debts from past lives, or their fate in this life led to misfortune; perhaps they were wrongly implicated by others or ensnared while attempting to rescue someone; or perhaps they were falsely accused due to the misdeeds of the deceased. Once imprisoned, all these cases are wrongful. Without resentment toward Heaven or blame toward others, enduring hardship with equanimity, free from distracting thoughts—this is what it means to purify the mind, settle the thoughts, and meditate upon the true scripture. Heaven aids the fortunate, and wrongful oppression will naturally be cleared without the need for argument. No prolonged struggle is necessary, for there is no principle in the world by which the innocent remain forever oppressed. Liberation comes swiftly.\n\n*\"Prison\"* (牢) refers to the confinement of the guilty; *\"custody\"* (狱) refers to awaiting trial. Today’s prisons, jails, and detention centers vary in severity, but all are places where the guilty are held. The two terms are not fundamentally distinct. Fetters and shackles restrain the guilty—those who suffer them are deemed guilty, for such is the nature of misfortune.\n\nSome say: *\"The character for 'prison' (牢) contains 'ox,' and 'custody' (狱) contains 'dog.' If one does not consume oxen or dogs, one will forever avoid prison.\"* This is merely to teach people not to kill living beings, not to indulge their appetites, and not to invite disaster through craving. Such is an ancillary meaning of the scripture, appended here for reference.\n\nThe scripture’s benefit lies in redressing wrongs. Even if one has committed offenses in the past, sincere repentance and renewal, free from resentment, coupled with the scripture’s salvific power and unwavering devotion, will eventually lead to liberation.\n\nKing Wen, who attained the Dao and became a sage, was imprisoned in Youli yet composed the *Book of Changes* and was pardoned. Gongye Chang, who aspired to the Dao and became a worthy, was bound in fetters yet soon released. Xu Shengong and Zhang Ziyang, who attained the Dao and became immortals, endured imprisonment in Changyi and the torments of the Three Trials—yet through their steadfast cultivation of the supreme Dao and their wondrous transmission of the *Awakening to Reality*, they both achieved liberation.\n\nNot only sages and worthies—even the foolish, if they cast aside deluded thoughts and steadfastly believe in the true scripture, will naturally escape the perils of prison.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nIn the most ancient times, there were no criminals and no penal systems. The Yellow Emperor captured Chi You, devised shackles, and drew boundaries to enforce prohibitions—thus the concept of penal systems arose. After the Three Dynasties, the penal system was fully established.\n\nThe scriptures existed before the kalpas, first expounded by the Primordial Beginning in the heavens. How then can they speak of prisons? The reason is that in every kalpa and every place, there are both good and evil; evil naturally incurs retribution, and the principle of imprisonment is inherent. The scriptures encompass all methods and eternally benefit all beings, containing every principle and foretelling the efficacy of deliverance from sin.\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures say: *\"By the power of Guanyin, fetters and shackles soon fall away.\"* The Confucian classics say: *\"The noble person is mindful of punishment.\"* The *Book of Changes* speaks of *\"misfortunes that are not one’s fault.\"* Have they not also spoken of prisons? Thus, we know that the scriptures are not the words of recent times but primordial and mysterious teachings.\n\nIn essence, a single thought aligned with principle becomes a hall of fortune; a single selfish thought becomes a prison of karma. If desires and delusions are not eradicated, the body becomes a pit of karma, and prison is already present. Mencius said: *\"The difference between humans and beasts is slight.\"* The character for *\"prison\"* (牢) contains *\"ox,\"* and *\"custody\"* (狱) contains *\"dog.\"* The creators of these characters had profound intent. For people of the present and future ages, steadfastly believing in this scripture will ensure that in every kalpa and every place, prison is avoided.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two (Continued) of the Meritorious Virtues Section**\nIf one is afflicted by malevolent spirits, demonic thieves, or manifold sufferings, reciting this true scripture in accordance with its methods will cause all evil beings to flee far away, and one will naturally be at peace.\n\nThe divine efficacy of the Jade Scripture—how could it be limited to merely resolving the perils of prison?\n\nIf one is afflicted by any manner of evil demons, spirits, ghosts, thieves, or manifold sufferings, reciting this true scripture in accordance with its methods will cause all malevolent spirits, ghosts, and thieves to flee far away, and one will naturally be at peace and free from harm.\n\n**Textual Verification:**\n*\"If one is afflicted\"* (若为) is equivalent to *\"if one suffers.\"* *\"Malevolent spirits\"* (邪精) refers to all that is unorthodox; *\"ghosts\"* (鬼) are the numinous beings of the yin realm; *\"thieves\"* (贼) are those who harm people and things. Some say that *\"thieves\"* here refers to evil people. The previous section already mentioned that *\"bandits and soldiers all retreat of their own accord.\"* Why then is *\"thieves\"* here interpreted as referring to people?\n\nGenerally, evil demons, spirits, and ghosts lie in wait for opportunities and exploit vulnerabilities, entering through a person’s unorthodox thoughts. Their coming is untraceable, and their going is unseen. They inflict harm in secret, making their actions unpredictable—hence they are called *\"ghostly thieves.\"*\n\nFrom celestial demons above to earthly sprites below—mountain specters, water anomalies, tree spirits, metal essences, fire imps, plant oddities, the essences of birds and beasts, ice and charcoal apparitions, *chī* monstrosities, ghostly spirits—all manner of unorthodox entities abound. These bring myriad afflictions: hurling bricks and tiles, startling chickens and dogs to demand sacrifices, disturbing households. Some cause people to become disoriented, their spirits wandering in confusion, raving without reason, dashing about wailing, lost in stupor, leaping and retching, howling in depravity, drunk in folly, harmed and ruined, unable to rest or eat, day and night in terror. In life, they know no peace; in death, they remain bound and obstructed—such are the myriad afflictions. *\"Add\"* (加) means calamity befalling a person.\n\nIf one recites this true scripture in accordance with the proper method, how could one be afflicted by unorthodox essences, ghostly thieves, and the myriad afflictions? Here, *\"in accordance with the proper method\"* does not mean mere ease of practice but rather single-minded devotion, aligning with the true Dao. When reciting this scripture, one need only follow the prescribed method of chanting, bowing in reverence, and recitation—then all unorthodox essences and ghostly thieves will flee far away.\n\nAnother interpretation holds that reciting this true scripture in accordance with the proper method allows a Daoist practitioner to recite on behalf of the afflicted, driving away all unorthodox entities and ensuring natural peace. No talismanic waters, exorcisms, medicinal remedies, or incantations are needed—merely hearing the scripture, the afflicted will naturally find peace, free from the myriad afflictions.\n\nIt is said that the Ancestral Celestial Master subdued all demons with his methods. The Dark Emperor cultivated the true Dao, vanquishing all unorthodox essences and governing humans and ghosts. The Perfected Sage Sa overcame demonic forces in his propagation of the Dao. Lord Lao subdued celestial demons. The Buddha’s mantras tamed demons. The former Confucian scholar Fan Zhongyan, having lodged on a battlefield, heard only the cries of small chickens, and ghosts ceased their mischief. Master Cheng subdued the Great-Headed Ghost, and when a multitude of ghosts moved his bed, his mind remained unmoved—all ghosts then retreated into hiding. Thus it is said: *\"When the Dao is lofty, dragons and tigers submit; when virtue is weighty, ghosts and spirits revere.\"*\n\nReciting this true scripture in accordance with the proper method—this secret and sacred canon, the most holy of true words—unlocks the mechanism unseen by ghosts and spirits. How could unorthodox essences and ghostly thieves fail to flee far away?\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nIn essence, the Three Corpses within the human body, the Five Orifices, the Seven *Po* souls, the Seven Emotions, the Six Desires, scattered thoughts, and deluded imaginings—all these yin tendencies are unorthodox essences and ghostly thieves. If one awakens to emptiness and clarity, wielding the sword of wisdom to slay demons, and extinguishes desires, then unorthodox essences and ghostly thieves will flee far away.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three of the Meritorious Virtues Section**\nIf one seeks descendants and, in accordance with the proper method, venerates and recites this scripture, the Emperor commands the celestial bureaus to examine the cinnabar registers. Among the nine ranks, the Four Fruits of Immortals, whose karmic cycles align with the destined time, will be dispatched to descend and be born as one’s child—gifted with exceptional talent and eloquence, esteemed among humanity.\n\nDoes the merit of this scripture merely subdue unorthodox entities? If one, childless and suffering, seeks descendants and recites this scripture in accordance with the method of venerating the canon, the Supreme Emperor will command the celestial bureaus to thoroughly examine the cinnabar records of immortals. Among the nine ranks, the Four Fruits of Immortals, whose cycles and numbers align with the destined time, will descend and be born as one’s child. To those without descendants who recite the scripture, such a child will be born—brilliant in talent, skilled in debate, wise and discerning, attaining the noble station of humanity.\n\n*\"Seek\"* (求) means to pray and beseech the gods. It may refer to others praying on one’s behalf or to one’s own prayers. Whether one has descendants is decreed by Heaven—can it truly be sought? Yet among the three forms of unfilial conduct, having no posterity is the gravest. One cannot but seek descendants. Moreover, humans are born of blood and qi; all beings with blood and qi can procreate. Some may have depleted their yin virtue, incurring Heaven’s displeasure; others may suffer from misaligned yang and yin, their fate marked by solitude; still others may have deficiencies in the womb or self-inflicted harm from desire and anger—thus remaining childless. Yet human determination can reverse Heaven’s decree. Sincerity moves the divine; there is none who cannot have descendants. Thus, descendants may indeed be sought.\n\n*\"Descendants\"* (嗣息): *\"Si\"* means to continue; some say it means *\"to connect\"* (系), as in continuing the ancestral line like a linked chain. Others say *\"si\"* means *\"to administer\"* (司), as in managing the family’s legacy and ensuring the transmission of its records. *\"Xi\"* refers to children who carry on the lineage, like the ceaseless breath of inhalation and exhalation. Moreover, the true breath of a person is the root of life and death; when breath ceases, qi is cut off. Having children ensures the ancestral sacrifices continue unbroken—hence the term *\"xi.\"* Fundamentally, *\"xi\"* originates from the heart. With a child, all things are fulfilled, and this heart may rest at ease—thus it is called *\"xi.\"*\n\nThe sages of the Three Teachings all had children. Why do people not recognize the weight of descendants?\n\n*\"In accordance with the proper method and with veneration\"* refers to revering the scripture. Some mistakenly interpret this as self-veneration. *\"Celestial bureaus\"* (天曹) are those who govern destiny and oversee the registers of immortals. The *\"nine ranks\"* consist of the upper three, middle three, and lower three grades, totaling nine. The *Scriptural Exegesis* states: *\"The nine grades of lotus flowers serve as parents.\"* In Buddhism, the nine ranks include Buddhas, bodhisattvas, those of perfect enlightenment, voice-hearers, arhats, and the four dhyanas.\n\nThe *\"Four Fruits of Immortals\"* are *Srotaāpanna*, *Sakṛdāgāmin*, *Anāgāmin*, and *Arhat*. *\"Descending to be born\"* (降谪下生) means immortals and Buddhas incarnating in the human realm, hence *\"descending.\"* *\"Talent\"* (才) refers to exceptional skill; *\"eloquence\"* (辩) to unparalleled verbal acuity.\n\nThe radiance of illumination shines upon all without exception. The wisdom of awakening comprehends all without obstruction. Among humankind, the most revered and noble are not merely kings, ministers, or teachers, but those who embody virtue and the Dao—perfected beings and true heirs. Thus, nothing is more revered than the Dao, nothing more noble than virtue. Even the Son of Heaven cannot enfeoff them as subjects, nor can feudal lords befriend them as equals. They assist in the unfolding of creation, shaping and sustaining all things, their legacy venerated for ten thousand generations, their supremacy acknowledged across the Three Realms. Hence, they are called the most revered and noble among humankind.\n\nTo revere this scripture in accordance with the Dharma, whether reciting it oneself or having others do so to seek descendants, though its efficacy is manifest, one must not expect results within a set time. Only by honoring the scripture, repenting of past transgressions, and maintaining unwavering devotion—treating this scripture as though beholding the Jade Emperor himself, and revering this Dharma-treasure with utmost sincerity—will the divine verses and numinous power silently transform fate, altering destiny and ensuring descendants. Even worldly meritorious officials may secure blessings for their offspring. How much more so for those who, as true believers in the scripture and propagators of the Dharma-wheel, become the meritorious ministers of Heaven and Earth? Shall they not ensure the prosperity of their descendants? If one reveres this scripture yet fails to beget heirs, it must be that their sincerity is insufficient or their devotion inconsistent with the Dharma. Let the people of the world take heed and be diligent, and they shall witness the scripture’s divine efficacy for themselves.\n\n**Chapter on Meritorious Virtues (continued, twenty-fourth section):**\nWhen a woman approaches the perilous month of childbirth and recites this true scripture in accordance with the Dharma, she shall secure the well-being of both mother and child, giving birth to sons or daughters of blessed fortune and virtue, beloved and revered by all. The scripture’s divine power extends far beyond merely ensuring descendants.\n\nWhen a woman in the perilous month of childbirth recites this true scripture in accordance with the Dharma, she shall promptly and safely deliver the child, free from distress, bearing sons or daughters of auspicious appearance and virtuous character, cherished and esteemed by all. A woman who has married into her husband’s family is called a *matron*. The *perilous month* refers to the time of childbirth, when life hangs in the balance, perilously close to death. To *recite the true scripture in accordance with the Dharma* means that, whether before labor begins—through her own devout recitation—or during labor—by having others recite the scripture—she shall ensure the safety of both mother and child. At the appointed hour of delivery, there shall be no complications; the child shall be born without delay, the mother unharmed, and the infant delivered smoothly, both thriving in peace and well-being, mutually benefiting.\n\n*Fortune* refers to those endowed with wealth, nobility, health, longevity, and auspicious signs. *Virtue* refers to those who are sagely, wise, loyal, righteous, filial, fraternal, and morally upright. *Sons or daughters* may be either male or female, both possessing fortune and virtue. *Beloved and revered by all* means they are endearing yet not to be treated with familiarity, approachable yet not to be trifled with. People delight in their company, praise them, and admire them—this is *love*. Yet at the mere sight of them, awe arises; in their presence, indolence vanishes. Though they speak not, they are trusted; though they act not, they are revered—this is *respect*.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nThat men are beloved and revered is understandable. But how can women be so? If a woman possesses a fully auspicious appearance, exemplary conduct, neither weeping nor frivolity, solemnity and reticence, minimal movement or laughter, displaying maturity in youth and dignity in age, maintaining purity until death, people will cherish her as kin and revere her as an elder. Such love is free from impropriety; it arises from admiration for her rare fortune and virtue.\n\n**Verification:**\nSafety of mother and child.\n\nFrom the *\"Shengmin\"* chapter of the *Book of Songs*, in praise of Jiang Yuan’s birth of Hou Ji: \"The firstborn came forth like a lamb, free from harm or disaster.\" As Jiang Yuan possessed virtue, her first birth was as effortless as that of a lamb, untouched by misfortune—mother and child both secure. The exegetical tradition states: \"Mother and child part early from the body.\" The *Daoist Canon* declares: \"At the moment of delivery, there is joy; in the pangs of labor, no peril.\" The merit of reciting scriptures responds as swiftly as an echo.\n\nToday, the *August Scripture* circulates widely in the world, and those who recite it are many. Yet when women give birth, some miscarry before their time; some suffer calamity, peril, or death; some bear ghostly fetuses or monstrous anomalies; some face karmic retribution or mutual affliction. Though many mothers and children remain safe, they cannot always both be preserved; in some cases, neither fares well. Some doubt the efficacy of recitation, unaware that the true Dharma is rarely encountered. Among the people, some have never heard of this scripture’s exalted status or its benefits; others have heard its name but fail to revere it. Some offer empty reverence without recitation; others recite but begin with zeal and end in neglect. Some omit passages or jumble them, or defile and invert them, miswriting characters and misplacing phrases, misconstruing their meaning. Though they may include texts of repentance and gratitude, they cannot attain the full merit of the scripture. All such errors are self-inflicted; failing to encounter the scripture’s power, they conclude that recitation is futile—this is slander of the Dharma.\n\nAlas! The true Dharma should be practiced, and the debt to one’s parents is hard to repay. To rescue the suffering and benefit the living is the urgent duty of those who study the Dao. If one teaches the world to revere and recite this scripture, mothers and children will be safe, the perils of childbirth averted, and good sons and daughters born. The world will be filled with those of fortunate and virtuous countenance, and the true Dao will endure forever. The merit is immeasurable. Let those who study this scripture take heed.\n\n*Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture, Volume Six* concludes.\n*Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture, Volume Seven* begins.\n\nCollated by the Fifty-First Celestial Master of the Han Succession, Great Perfected Zhang Guoxiang.\nReviewed by the Recluse Beyond the Court, Luo Hongxian of Jishui, Jiangxi, former *Zhuangyuan*.\nCompiled by Zhou Xuanchen of Xiaozhaochen, Jinan, Shandong.\n*Merit Section*, continued from Chapter Twenty-Five.\n\nShould one seek office and promotion, desiring rank and emolument to flourish, and noble audience with the sovereign—if one upholds and recites this true scripture in accordance with the proper method—then one shall obtain advancement in office and duty, with descendants honored and exalted, their prosperity unbroken through the generations. How could the benefits of this Jade Scripture be limited merely to safe childbirth?\n\nTo seek office is to obtain position where none existed before. To advance in rank: *advance* means to ascend; when one’s post is humble, one strives for promotion to higher and more distinguished office. *Rank* refers to the titles conferred upon officials; *emolument* denotes the stipends they receive. *Flourish* signifies joyous ease, upright felicity, and propitious profit; *attain* means the fulfillment of one’s aspirations and the success of one’s plans. *Noble audience with the sovereign*: to rise above the common is to be noble; when rank and emolument flourish, one may further receive the sovereign’s governance and the ruler’s favor. The meeting of ruler and minister has ever been rare. Only when nobility is matched by audience with the sovereign does the minister’s elevation become truly meaningful—this is what it means to attain. Some say it refers to encountering a wise and enlightened ruler. The phrase *this true* is not redundant; the syntax requires it.\n\n*Office and duty*: an office entails both administrative authority and specific responsibilities, each with its own jurisdiction—hence *office*. *Duty* refers to governmental affairs. *Transfer* means to be reassigned to a more desirable post, or to move from an idle sinecure to a position of influence. *Descendants honored and exalted*: this may entail hereditary office and emolument, or the conferral of rank upon one’s children and grandchildren, ensuring enduring wealth, honor, and prosperity that illumines the past and enriches the future—both honor and nobility enduring unbroken through the generations. Though not equal to the permanence of heaven and earth, such blessings flow to posterity, their fortune and grace extending unbroken in an unending line. Even if limited to several generations, it is still called long-lasting. Consider the supreme virtue of Confucius or the divine transformations of the Ancestral Celestial Master—through the ages, their descendants received imperial enfeoffments, true honor and nobility unceasing.\n\nEnfeoffment, rank, and stipends derive from the imperial court’s official system. If they cannot be sought, how does one advance through the ranks? If they cannot be schemed for, then—whether in civil or military service—one must study the classics or master strategy, accumulating learning and merit, for these cannot be borrowed. How, then, can one seek advancement? The principle is this: office is conferred upon the virtuous, and emolument sustains the worthy. Those of great virtue must attain their rightful position and renown.\n\nIf one upholds this true scripture in accordance with the proper method, reciting its divine words and adhering to its sagely teachings, aligning one’s heart with heaven and moving in harmony with the Dao, one becomes a person of great goodness. Whether through eloquent speech or exemplary conduct, one may be recommended for office despite lacking rank, or granted emolument despite holding no post; or, if already in office, one may be promoted. This is the natural principle of employing the worthy. When virtue draws forth recognition, even if one seeks it not—like Guangcheng, Yin Shou, Chaoyou, or Yan Guang—one may become an imperial teacher or a guest of the state, though one may decline. How, then, can it be said that the good cannot obtain rank and emolument? Consider Zhuge Liang of the Han, or Jingyang, Li Bi, and Hai Chan of the Jin and Tang—all attained office through the cultivation of the Dao. The scripture speaks of seeking office; why doubt it?\n\nIn essence, the celestial rank of inherent nobility resides within us all. To transcend the mundane and enter sainthood is a gradual ascent in virtue. Through divine transformation, one ascends to immortality, enduring through the kalpas unharmed. As the *Daodejing* says: \"Though the body dies, it does not perish.\" The immortals’ traditions declare: \"Children beget grandchildren, and grandchildren beget descendants.\" The Dao is revered, virtue is exalted, and the transmission of immortality is endless. Those who do not covet worldly fame or fleeting profit, but cultivate the celestial rank of inherent nobility—progressing from the mortal to the sagely, transcending the dust to ascend as immortals—shall perpetuate their lineage forever. This is the true fruit of upholding this true scripture in accordance with the proper method.\n\n*Merit Section, continued from Chapter Twenty-Six*\n\nShould one desire abundant wealth and prosperity, and uphold this true scripture in accordance with the proper method, one shall obtain treasures in overflowing abundance, with clothing and sustenance naturally provided, blessings flowing to descendants and transmitted to posterity. How could the benefits of this scripture be limited merely to the fulfillment of one’s ambitions for office?\n\nShould one desire abundant household wealth and resources, and uphold this true scripture in accordance with the proper method, one shall obtain an overflowing abundance of goods, treasures, and luxuries, with clothing and food pure and plentiful, naturally abundant. The remaining blessings shall flow to descendants and be transmitted to posterity.\n\n*Resources* refers to what is needed; the necessities of oneself and one’s family are called *resources*. Some say it means *to rely upon*, signifying that people depend on these for their livelihood—equivalent to *capital*. *Wealth* refers to goods and property, or the means of sustenance. *Abundant* means substantial, the quality of being fully provided. *Prosperous* describes a household in the utmost plenty, with wealth and resources in full sufficiency.\n\n*Uphold*: to revere is to *uphold*; to maintain, observe, and recite. *Treasures*: *wealth* refers to goods and property; *treasures* are valuable items such as gold, silver, pearls, jade, rarities, curios, fine fabrics—all things rare, precious, and esteemed. *Overflowing* means full to excess; *abundant* means plentiful. *Clothing and sustenance naturally provided*: without expending effort, one enjoys natural abundance. *Blessings flowing to descendants*: *blessings* are auspicious signs; when fortune and grace extend far, passing through generations in unbroken succession, it is called *blessings flowing to descendants*. *Transmitted to posterity*: not limited to one generation’s children and grandchildren, but passed down through the ages, so that later generations forever enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\n*Resolving Doubts*:\nConfucius said: \"If wealth could be sought, though it required holding a whip as a lowly servant, I would do it. If it cannot be sought, I shall follow what I love.\" This strongly suggests that wealth cannot be sought—how, then, can this scripture say that if one desires abundance and upholds it in accordance with the proper method, one shall attain wealth and blessings flowing to posterity? Does this not imply that wealth *can* be sought?\n\nZixia said: \"I have heard that wealth and nobility are decreed by heaven.\" Though wealth may be desirable, fate determines it, and heaven truly governs it—how, then, can it be sought? Yet while wealth may be fated, the early Confucians said: \"Wealth, nobility, fortune, and grace enrich one’s end, as reward for virtue.\" To uphold this scripture in accordance with the proper method, reciting its celestial words and revering the august heavens, is to be one whose virtue earns blessing.\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says: \"Joyful is the noble man—blessings and grace sustain him.\" This is precisely what is meant. Yet some argue: \"Great Yu was a sage, yet he drank plainly, wore coarse clothes, and dwelt in a humble palace, content with frugality and restraint.\" The Daoists say: \"To study the Dao, one must embrace bone-deep poverty.\" Such claims make the assertion that upholding this scripture brings wealth seem like a lure for personal gain. But Yu’s self-denial was the heart of a sage, free from selfish attachment. The Daoist pursuit of poverty was a mind unburdened by material things. That wealth may be sought and attained is but a demonstration of the scripture’s efficacy. The Buddhist sutras say: \"All that is sought shall be fulfilled.\" Both teachings open wide their gates of expedient means, offering boundless blessings and benefits—every prayer answered, every wish granted. Yet if doubt lingers, if effort wavers from diligence to neglect, if the heart’s resolve is flawed, lacking steadfast faith and perfect sincerity, then even seeking will yield nothing. Those who study this scripture must take this to heart.\n\nI have long observed that all things are complete within us, and inherent wealth requires no external acquisition. Why, then, do people chase fame and profit, vie for fleeting splendor, and indulge in desires, mistaking the false for the true? The poor grieve, unable to uphold the great Dao or recite the true scripture. The rich live in excess, unwilling to abandon cunning gain or honor the sacred words, content to age and die, forfeiting their innate abundance. Laozi said: \"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them; wealth and pride invite their own downfall.\" This warns against pursuing the external while neglecting the inner. Now, to speak of the scripture’s power to bring wealth is to redirect the heart’s pursuit toward reverence for the scripture. Ah! Upholding it truly yields results—but without sincerity, one invites only fault. Those who study this scripture must be cautious.\n\n**Chapter on Merits, Continued (27)**\nIf one is afflicted by malign stars, suffering hardship and confinement to bed, and upholds this true scripture according to the proper method, those malign stars will reverse their course and bestow auspicious blessings. The benefits of this scripture extend far beyond the attainment of wealth. If one’s fate in a given year is overshadowed by malign stars, bringing distress, restless sleep, and affliction, reciting this true scripture with due reverence will transform misfortune into fortune, turning those malign stars into harbingers of good fortune.\n\nRed Pine said: \"All people are solitary, each bearing a star.\" Yet the stars’ influence may be auspicious or inauspicious—auspicious stars bring a thousand blessings, while inauspicious ones foretell calamity. Those under the light of the Three Luminaries must ever be vigilant. Malign stars are inauspicious stars, such as Rahu, Ketu, the Star of Ruin, the Star of Wailing, the Star of Defeat, and the Star of Retreat. Their \"overshadowing\" may occur in one’s natal chart, annual fate, or the astrological division of one’s dwelling—wherever their influence falls, it is fixed and inescapable. \"Distress\" means thwarted aspirations, stifled and unfulfilled. \"Suffering\" may be poverty, illness, or peril pressing upon the body. \"Distress and confinement to bed\" describe utter helplessness, restless sleep, and unceasing agitation—some say it portends startling dreams. The term \"malign stars\" encompasses all inauspicious celestial bodies whose influence, whether in fate, annual fortune, or dwelling, brings misfortune.\n\nYet when one upholds this scripture with proper devotion, its divine verses transform ill omens into blessings. Though malign stars typically bring only misfortune, the scripture’s power ensures that those under their sway not only avoid calamity but receive hidden blessings and good fortune. The stars’ influence in fate or dwelling is fixed—how, then, can reciting the scripture turn malign stars auspicious? Heaven and humanity share a single principle, and the realms above and below are interconnected. The mechanism of resonance is swifter than an echo. When Duke Xiang of Song spoke three words of humane governance, the planet Mars retreated from its position. Nor is this power reserved for rulers: a faithful widow’s grievance brought three years of drought, and a lowly servant’s remorse summoned frost in June. Even common men and women can move heaven and earth, stir gods and spirits—provided their sincerity is unfeigned. With perfect sincerity, a single word can win the trust of the divine, and silence itself can alter the workings of creation. How much more so this true scripture, the essence of heaven and earth, by which the Three Luminaries attain their radiance! To uphold it with reverence, to honor its sacred verses and profound mysteries, is to scatter inauspicious stars, summon good fortune, and turn calamity into blessing.\n\nHuman nature is one: following the good brings fortune, defying it brings misfortune. The *Scripture of Central Admonitions* says: \"The stars’ influence—auspicious or inauspicious—is summoned by one’s own deeds. Those who do good shine with starlight; great goodness shines brightly. Those who do neither good nor evil glow faintly; minor transgressions scatter their light; grave sins extinguish it.\" When malign stars descend, their retribution falls upon the guilty; the blameless may escape punishment, while the virtuous turn misfortune into fortune. As the saying goes: \"A single evil thought becomes a malevolent star or vengeful ghost; a single good thought becomes a propitious star or auspicious cloud.\" Fortune and misfortune hinge on the goodness or evil of a single thought. To truly uphold this scripture is to dispel even the gravest disasters and calamities—how much more so the distress of confinement or fleeting misfortune? King Tai Jia said: \"Heaven-sent disasters may yet be averted.\" This is the same principle.\n\nWhen one can magnify the Dao and assist in creation, silently reciting the true scripture to penetrate the divine and master transformation, one’s virtue aligns with heaven and earth, one’s brightness with the sun and moon, one’s order with the four seasons, and one’s fortune with the gods and spirits. Mastering creation, one transcends the mortal realm, eluding the gaze of ghosts and spirits, untouched by life and death—how then could stars constrain one’s fate? Let those who study this scripture take heed.\n\n**Chapter on Merits, Continued (28)**\nIf one’s life has ended and they are bound for hell, their name recorded in the ledgers of the damned, their parents, teachers, spouse, or children may recite this scripture on their behalf, or establish a ritual altar with banners and offerings. Thus, the deceased’s name is erased from the ghostly registers, their spirit reborn in the Pure Land, and all suffering souls are delivered. By this supreme merit, all ascend to heaven.\n\nThe merits of this scripture not only absolve one’s faults in life, but when a person’s allotted span has ended and their soul is bound for hell—with their name inscribed in the ledgers of evil—then their parents, teachers, spouse, sons, or daughters should recite this scripture on their behalf or establish a ritual altar for deliverance, adorned with banners and offerings. Thus, the deceased’s name is erased from the ghostly registers, their spirit reborn in the Pure Land, and all those who share the same hell, the same death, or the same ledger of suffering are likewise redeemed by the scripture’s power, ascending to heaven through this most sublime and wondrous Dharma benefit.\n\nWhen it is said that one’s *allotted span has ended*, it means their destined years have passed and they die. *Bound for hell* refers to those who, whether in past lives or this one, have committed sins and must enter hell to receive their karmic retribution. *Hell* encompasses realms such as Fengdu, the Iron Enclosure, the Nine Hells, Eighteen Hells, Twenty-Four Hells, Thirty-Six Hells, Seventy-Two Hells, and the Avīci Hell. *Inscribed in the ledgers of evil* means their name is recorded in the registers of wickedness to face retribution. *Parents and teachers* may refer to the deceased’s own parents, their mentors, or elders. *Spouse, sons, or daughters* indicates that whether the deceased was a man or woman, they would have had a spouse; if not, then children or other kin would remain. *Should recite this scripture on their behalf* means the living relatives must uphold and chant this scripture for the departed. *Or establish a ritual altar* refers to arranging a sacred space to follow the Daoist rites and liberate the deceased from sin, hence called a *ritual altar*. *Banners and offerings*: Banners, inscribed with endless praises of the sacred names, are hung from tall poles so the wind may carry their radiant light in all directions. *Flowers* are the finest blossoms offered to welcome the divine. In heaven, the spreading of the Dharma is naturally accompanied by banners, canopies, and pennants, as well as resplendent celestial flowers, all manifesting auspicious brilliance. In the mortal realm, banners are merely placed in the ritual space to adorn it and invoke divine favor. *Offerings*: *Offer* means to present, while *nourish* refers to providing food and drink. In heaven, the purest and most wondrous Dharma is the true sustenance, and the celestial kitchens’ sacred offerings are given only with reverence and devotion. In this world, the five offerings and ten offerings—though they may include the emptying of the five aggregates, the removal of the five sufferings, the restraint of the five pleasures, the abandonment of the ten evils, the contemplation of the ten truths, and the abiding in the ten faiths—are ultimately meant to honor the radiant deities, revere the true Dharma, and uphold the sacred scriptures. This is the true offering. Yet today, people merely present food, flowers, fruits, and rare treasures without genuine reverence—this is but a superficial practice. The *offerings* spoken of in this scripture are those of sincere and natural devotion.\n\n*Thus, the deceased’s name is erased from the ghostly registers, their spirit reborn in the Pure Land.* By reciting this scripture once or establishing a ritual altar, the departed are freed from the dark underworld, their black karma dissolved, their names stricken from the ledgers of evil, and their spirits reborn in the Pure Land of bliss. All those who share the same hell, the same death, or the same ledger of suffering are likewise delivered by the compassionate power of this scripture. *All* means everyone. *Ascending to heaven through this sublime Dharma benefit*: *This* refers to the merit of the scripture. Though heavenly blessings may eventually wane, a single recitation of this true scripture—or the establishment of a ritual altar—erases the sins of the deceased and those suffering in hell, allowing them to be reborn in heaven. If one upholds it perpetually, how could its merits ever be exhausted? Alas, hell has no gate—it is man who invites it; heaven has a path, yet the deluded cannot walk it. Moreover, the original nature of life is the true scripture of the Imperial Dao. To uphold and recite it always is to remain unstained by hell or heaven, forever attaining the mysterious truth.\n\nThus, those who diligently uphold this scripture:\n\n**Chapter on Merits, Continued (29)**\nWherever this scripture resides, the Ten Heavenly Perfected Great Saints and the Boundless Flying Celestial Kings shall attend and make offerings. Those who uphold this scripture may rightfully call themselves *Orthodox Unity Perfected Ones*. Wherever they dwell, the Vajra Warriors of the Ten Directions, the most true and sacred, shall secretly guard them as they would their own bodies. Whether going out or coming in, wherever they travel, all evil spirits will flee, demons and ghosts will be eradicated, malevolent spirits will hide in submission, and no calamity or misfortune shall draw near. When such a scripture-holder’s life is about to end, they will no longer witness the dreadful visions of hell but will instead see celestial maidens from the heavenly palaces descending with banners to welcome them, and they shall be reborn in heaven. When their heavenly blessings are exhausted and they descend to the human realm, for a thousand lives and ten thousand lives they shall always be kings or great ministers, blessed with sagely rulers and wise counselors, their lands at peace, their people content, and their innate nature ever luminous. They shall follow the Great Dao, advancing in cultivation until they reach the shore of the Dao.\n\nSuch are the blessings bestowed upon those who uphold this scripture. How could its merits benefit only the living and the dead? Wherever this scripture resides, the Ten Heavenly Perfected Great Saints and the Boundless Flying Celestial Kings shall always attend and make offerings. Those who uphold this scripture may rightfully call themselves *Orthodox Unity Perfected Ones*. Wherever they dwell, the Vajra Warriors of the Ten Directions, the most true and sacred, shall secretly guard them as they would their own bodies. Whether going out or coming in, wherever they travel, all evil spirits will retreat, the path they walk will be cleansed of demons and ghosts, malevolent spirits will hide in submission, and no calamity or misfortune shall draw near. When such a scripture-holder’s life is about to end, they will no longer witness the dreadful visions of hell but will instead see celestial maidens from the heavenly palaces descending with banners and regalia to welcome them, and they shall be reborn in heaven. When their heavenly blessings are exhausted and they descend to the human realm, for a thousand lives and ten thousand lives they shall always be kings or great ministers, blessed with sagely rulers and wise counselors, their lands at peace, their people content, and their innate nature ever luminous. They shall follow the Great Dao, advancing in cultivation until they reach the shore of the Dao.\n\nThe scripture-holder who thus receives such blessings shall be favored in this manner. The Ten Heavens and the ten directions’ hosts of heavens—flying celestial spirit-kings, those divine kings who soar and roam in protection of the heavens—along with their retinues standing in attendance and guard, the Perfected of Orthodox Unity (those of utmost rectitude and impartiality, true and undivided in oneness), and the vajra-enforcers of both teachings, all come to safeguard the scripture-holder. They secretly shield this person, guarding them in concealment as if protecting their own divine bodies, so earnest is the care of these spirits. Wherever the scripture-holder goes—whether departing or entering, whether in travel or repose—all demonic beings, malevolent spirits, ghosts, and specters flee and hide in submission, utterly eradicated and banished. Calamity, misfortune, and disaster cannot draw near.\n\nWhen such a person’s life comes to an end, they shall no longer witness the dreadful visions of hell in all their forms. Celestial maidens from the heavenly palaces—*not* to be mistaken as \"heavenly officials\" (天官)—descend bearing the great Dharma-banners, neither flags nor pennants, to welcome and guide them upward to heaven. For a thousand lives and ten thousand lives, they shall be kings and great ministers, ever noble through the ages, just as the Buddha was a royal prince for eighteen thousand lifetimes, the Dark Emperor was a king for a thousand lifetimes and a chief minister for another thousand, and Lord Lao served as the teacher of emperors and kings across kalpas. They shall dwell in lasting peace and joy, their innate nature ever luminous, their great wisdom and profound insight undimmed by the good causes of past kalpas. They shall uphold, revere, and follow the Great Dao, advancing in cultivation through repeated practice until they reach the shore of the Dao—attaining the Dao as one crosses to the far shore of the sea. The Buddha spoke of \"arriving at the other shore,\" and the *Greater Elegantiae* says: \"He first ascended to the shore.\" This is what is meant. Some call it the \"bank of the Dao.\"\n\nThe merit of upholding this scripture brings benefit at every moment, whether for the living or the dead, for few or many, for long or short durations—all wishes shall be fulfilled, and its transformative power is truly divine. Through thousands and tens of thousands of lifetimes, unwavering devotion and repeated cultivation will at last lead one to the shore of the Dao. Thus is the difficulty of great attainment made clear. Those who study this scripture must steel their resolve, for they may enter the most exalted ranks.\n\n**Chapter on Merits, Continued (Thirty-One)**\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture, when rain falls, arouses great compassion and, in accordance with the Dharma, recites these three scrolls once toward the empty sky, then wherever the rain touches and in the direction it faces, all sentient beings—those guilty of the five rebellions, the ten evils, and all grave transgressions—shall have their sins wholly dissolved. All serious illnesses shall naturally be cured. After the lives of these beings end, they shall not fall into hell but shall be reborn in the Pure Land, transformed from lotus flowers. How much more so for those who uphold this scripture!\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture, while traveling on the road, encounters a great wind that blows upon them, then wherever the dust from their body touches, all sentient beings shall have their evil karma completely eradicated. They shall no longer fall into the three evil destinies but shall be reborn in the heavens. Thus is the merit of upholding this scripture beyond all conception.\n\nThe merit of this scripture does not benefit only the individual. If one who upholds this scripture, when rain falls, arouses a heart of great compassion to deliver the world and, in accordance with the Dharma, recites these three scrolls—upper, middle, and lower—once toward the empty sky, then wherever the rain moistens and in the direction it faces, all sentient beings—those guilty of the five rebellions, the ten evils, and all grave transgressions—shall have their sins wholly dispersed and eradicated. All serious illnesses shall naturally be healed and restored to health. After the lives of these beings in the direction the scripture-holder faces end, they shall not fall into hell but shall be reborn in the Pure Land, free from defilement, transformed from lotus flowers. How could the merit of those who uphold this scripture be measured?\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture, while traveling on the road, encounters a great wind that blows upon them, then wherever the dust from their body touches, all sentient beings shall have their evil karma completely eradicated. They shall no longer fall into the three evil destinies but shall be reborn in the heavens. Thus is the merit of upholding this scripture beyond all conception.\n\n**Textual Verification and Doubt Resolution:**\nThe scripture-holder is compassionate in all places, not only when rain falls or wind rises. The phrase \"when rain falls or wind rises\" is used to emphasize the efficacy of upholding the scripture. \"Great compassion\" is the deep pity and concern for all beings in the world. As the Buddhist teachings say, \"the heart of compassion is too fervent.\" The *Book of Songs* says: \"Pity these solitary and suffering ones,\" and also: \"Have compassion for those who have not become whole.\" The Daoist scriptures say: \"Great compassion awakens the world.\" The scripture-holder, moved by the suffering of beings bound by karma, arouses great compassion.\n\nThe five rebellions are: disloyalty, unfiliality, lack of kindness, discord, and injustice. Another interpretation holds them to be: disrespect for Heaven and Earth, ruler and parents, and teachers; disrespect for the Three Treasures; failure to uphold precepts; neglect of virtuous conduct; and ignorance of the nature of mind. Yet another interpretation sees them as indulgence in wealth, sensuality, fame, food, and sleep.\n\nThe ten evils are: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, divisive speech, false speech, frivolous speech, harsh speech, greed, anger, and delusion.\n\n\"All serious illnesses shall be cured.\" *Cured* means restored to health; *healed* means returned to wholeness.\n\n\"Transformed from lotus flowers\": In Buddhist teaching, this refers to rebirth in the Western Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss, where beings are born from lotus flowers. In Daoist teaching, it refers to the Azure Flower Realm of Eternal Joy, where beings are transformed from lotus flowers. Another saying holds that desire arises from the lotus flower, meaning that in both worldly and transcendent existence, one remains unstained by a single speck of dust, and the wondrous Dharma gives rise to life without defiled thoughts. It is also likened to the primordial state of Heaven and Earth, where beings are naturally transformed into existence.\n\nConfucian scholars often dismiss these two teachings as delusion, yet was Yi Yin, born from a hollow mulberry, not a sage of the Confucian tradition? Moreover, the human heart is like the lotus—understanding the lotus’s birth reveals the seal of the mind’s essence. How excellent that Master Zhou, in observing the lotus, not only admired its purity amid mud but must also have had a deeper insight. Thus he became a patriarch of the Learning of the Dao.\n\nThe three evil destinies are hell, demonic spirits, and animals. \"Beyond conception\" means beyond the reach of thought or speech, signifying that the merit is immeasurable.\n\nThe Dao’s deliverance of the world and the true scripture’s benefit to humanity are like the soaking rain that nourishes all, resounding through the ten directions and benefiting the entire Dharma realm. The Confucian tradition says: \"There are those transformed as if by timely rain,\" and also: \"The wind in the trees makes its sound,\" and further: \"Not swift yet speedy, passing through and transforming, abiding and divine—people daily turn toward goodness without knowing who effects it.\" Thus when the Duke of Zhou was born, there were no violent winds or excessive rains, and even beyond the seas, people turned toward civilization. If one can ultimately attain the Dao and uphold the true scripture, then whether touched by rain or wind, or even where wind and rain do not reach and water and dust do not touch, the three thousand great thousand worlds shall forever be bathed in the benefit of the Dharma. Thus it is said that the merit of upholding this scripture is beyond conception.\n\n**Chapter on Merits, Thirty-One Continued**\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture crosses rivers, the Huai, or the sea, and bathes in their waters, then wherever the water from their body touches, all beings within—fish, turtles, soft-shelled turtles, and all aquatic creatures—shall have their evil karma wholly eradicated for the remainder of this life. After their lives end, they shall no longer be reborn from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation.\n\nAll speech and sound uttered by one who upholds this scripture shall be pure Dharma sounds, and all demonic and heterodox beings who hear them shall be thus purified.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture encounters temples of various spirits and recites this scripture for them, then upon hearing it, those spirits shall escape the ghostly realm and ascend to the attainment of immortality. They shall revere this person as if serving an emperor.\n\nThe merit of one who upholds this scripture extends not only to humans. When this scripture passes through rivers, the Huai, or the sea, and one bathes in their waters, wherever the water from their body touches, all beings within—fish, turtles, soft-shelled turtles, and all aquatic creatures—shall have the evil karma they accumulated in past lives wholly eradicated for the remainder of this present life. After their lives end, they shall attain wondrous fruition and no longer be reborn from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation.\n\nAll speech and sound uttered by one who upholds this scripture—whether demons or heterodox beings hear them—shall not be perceived as worldly words or sounds but as pure Dharma tones. If one who upholds this scripture encounters temples of various spirits and recites this scripture for them, those spirits, upon hearing it, shall escape the ghostly realm and ascend to the attainment of immortality. They shall revere this upholder of the scripture as if serving the Emperor who expounds it.\n\n*Jingshe* (经涉): *Jing* means to pass through; *she* means to ford. One interpretation holds that *she* refers to crossing water on foot, as when Lü Dongbin chanted verses while flying over Dongting Lake or when Bodhidharma crossed the river on a reed. In essence, any crossing of water, whether on foot or by boat, is called *jingshe*. Rivers and seas are general terms for flowing waters. The Huai refers to the Huai River. *Muyu qishen* (沐浴其身) means to bathe one’s body in water. *Qizhong zhongsheng* (其中众生) refers to all living beings in the water. Those with scales are fish; those with shells are turtles, soft-shelled turtles, and the like. All aquatic life shall have their evil karma eradicated for this one lifetime alone. After death, they shall no longer cycle through the destinies of beasts—whether feathered, furred, scaled, shelled, or born of womb, egg, moisture, or transformation. Though humans are born of wombs, the term \"womb\" here does not refer to them but to other kinds. Even the dragon, lord of aquatic beings, is subject to karmic retribution; how much more so the lesser creatures below.\n\nThe true upholder of this scripture emanates golden light from body and speech. Thus, wherever their voice reaches, all demons and heterodox beings who hear it perceive only pure Dharma tones. When the scripture is recited for spirits, they escape the ghostly realm. Though spirits possess numinous power, manifest awe-inspiring radiance, and display karmic responses, they remain bound by their condition. Upon hearing this true scripture, their root consciousness is liberated, their karmic tendencies uprooted—what is called \"dissolving all past habits.\" They ascend to the attainment of immortality, the highest realization of the true immortal’s Way.\n\nThe distinction between spirits and immortals lies in their station. Though spirits may possess merit, their glory and achievements remain manifest; even great spirits are thus constrained. They resemble noble sages who have not yet transcended form and trace, or those who have entered sagehood yet remain unrefined. Immortals, however, empty the five aggregates, purify the nine consciousnesses, transcend subject and object, and merge principle and phenomena. Though divided into five ranks, they stand far above spirits and ghosts.\n\nWhen the sage emerges, all things flourish: mountains do not crumble, rivers do not dry, and birds, beasts, fish, and turtles all thrive in harmony. The dharma-water of the scripture-holder’s bath bestows its blessings upon aquatic beings, surpassing even the transformative power of a sagely king. When dragons receive the Dharma and awaken to profound insight, and when the dharma-water equally touches all, how could they not transcend? This is how the wild fox, upon receiving the Dharma, regained a human form. When the scripture is expounded to deliver spirits and ghosts from their condition—like Master Sa who delivered Marshal Wang or Master Pu who delivered Lord Guan—it causes them to revere divine majesty and forget past attachments. Thus, to this day, the reverence of these two sages has not waned.\n\n**Chapter on Merit, Continuation of the Thirty-Second Section**\n\nIf one, while alive, fails to honor parents, disrespects the Three Treasures, kills, steals, engages in sexual misconduct, or utters falsehoods—committing the gravest of sins—and is on the verge of death, should a devout and faithful man or woman, moved by great compassion, recite the august name of the Jade Emperor seven times, fourteen times, twenty-one times, twenty-eight times, or even a hundred or a thousand times by the dying person’s side before their last breath fades, then all the unwholesome karma they accumulated in life shall be wholly eradicated. They shall not fall into any evil destinies but shall ascend to the Nine Heavens of Primordial Qi. How much more so for one who upholds this scripture?\n\nFurthermore, if one has wandered through countless kalpas, drifting between heaven and the mortal realm, accumulating thousands of transgressions and myriad faults, and then encounters one who upholds this scripture—even if their shadow briefly falls upon them, as if embraced by the radiance of the Celestial Emperor, or if they converse with them or merely hear their voice, as if receiving the Celestial Emperor’s Dharma words of comfort—then that person’s karmic obstructions shall be forever eradicated.\n\nThe merit of this scripture extends not only downward to beings but upward to spirits and gods. If one, while alive, disrespects the Three Treasures, kills, steals, engages in sexual misconduct, or utters falsehoods—committing the gravest of sins—and is on the verge of death, should a devout and faithful man or woman, moved by great compassion, recite the august name of the Jade Emperor seven, fourteen, twenty-one, or up to a hundred or a thousand times by the dying person’s side before their last breath fades, then all the unwholesome karma they accumulated in life shall be wholly eradicated. They shall not fall into any evil destinies but shall ascend to the Nine Heavens of Primordial Qi. How much more so for one who upholds this scripture?\n\nFurthermore, if one has wandered through countless kalpas, drifting between heaven and the mortal realm, accumulating thousands of transgressions and myriad faults, and then encounters one who upholds this scripture—even if their shadow briefly falls upon them, as if embraced by the radiance of the Celestial Emperor, or if they converse with them or merely hear their voice, as if receiving the Celestial Emperor’s Dharma words of comfort—then that person’s karmic obstructions shall be forever eradicated.\n\nThe Three Treasures are the Dao, the scriptures, and the masters. The Dao is the source of the Three Teachings and the origin of all existence; the scriptures are the bridge to salvation across the world.\n\nThe master is the eye and guide for humans and devas; to disrespect them is to incur one sin. Taking life, theft, sexual misconduct, and false speech—great transgressions bring great sins, yet even the mere sprouting of a single thought of these is sinful. Such offenses are manifold, not confined to one type, and words cannot exhaust their enumeration.\n\nTrue faith is utmost sincerity, devoid of any ulterior motive. Whether reciting once in seven days, twice or thrice or four times in seven days, or a thousand or ten thousand times, or speaking of the Dao’s cyclical transformations of merit—all are valid. One does not fall into evil destinies, for one possesses good roots and harbors no perverse thoughts, thus avoiding such fates. Rebirth among humans and devas refers to the blessings of the human realm and heavenly realms. Some say human blessings constitute \"human-deva\" blessings. Drifting through the world’s domains describes the impermanence of life and death, like duckweed adrift on water, bound by karmic tendencies and difficult to escape, as if drowning in water. The world’s domains refer to the boundaries of the mundane realm.\n\nWhen the shadow of one who upholds this scripture briefly falls upon a wrongdoer, it is as if the Celestial Emperor’s radiance has embraced and received them. *Shou* (受) should not be read as *shou* (授, \"to bestow\"), for it is not the Emperor’s light bestowing upon them. Generally, when such light descends upon a person, reverence arises spontaneously, and distracting thoughts vanish—hence it is called \"embracing and receiving.\" We receive the Dharma benefits of that light.\n\nWhether conversing with or merely hearing the voice of one who upholds the scripture—if the wrongdoer engages with them or hears their voice, the words of the Dao are profound and mysterious. Some say these are the words of the Dao Ancestor, but this interpretation is overly restrictive. *Wei yu* (慰谕) means to comfort with kind words and instruct with teachings and commands. The eradication of karmic obstructions means all sins from past lives and the present are released, and all hindrances from past kalpas and the present life are removed.\n\nThe scripture’s divine efficacy benefits both the living and the deceased, extending its blessings universally. Yet only those of true faith receive this merit. Thus, the foundation lies in utmost sincerity. If even the deceased are thus benefited, how immeasurable must be the merit of one who upholds this scripture? Let the reader take heed.\n\n**Chapter 33 (Continued: Merits of Upholding the Scripture)**\n\nFurthermore, if one who upholds this scripture fashions a long banner, inscribes the Emperor’s sacred name upon it, and hangs it from a tall pole—whether at a Daoist abbey or in a household courtyard—when the wind blows the banner toward any direction, all beings in that quarter shall partake of its sublime blessings, and all their evil karma shall be eradicated.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture inscribes the Emperor’s sacred name upon any resonant object—be it bells, chimes, handbells, cymbals, or other ritual implements and instruments used in Daoist ceremonies—whether sounded in a ritual arena, struck in play, or set in motion by the wind, when the sound issues forth, near or far, all beings who hear it shall have their karmic obstructions purified. Here again is expounded the merit of upholding the scripture.\n\nLong banners inscribed with the Emperor’s name, tall poles—both have been explained previously. *Guanyu* (观宇) refers to the halls within a Daoist abbey. *Guan* (观) means \"abbey,\" where the spirit resides without distraction, for one’s mind is wholly fixed in sincere contemplation—hence it is called *guan*. *Jiating* (家庭) refers to the courtyard of a household. The direction the wind blows the banner is the quarter toward which it points. *Shengli* (胜利, \"sublime blessings\") has been explained earlier.\n\nBells, chimes, handbells, cymbals, and clappers are all ritual instruments made of metal. *All ritual implements and instruments* include those of metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, clay, leather, and wood, as well as any resonant objects or tools used in Daoist ceremonies. In a ritual arena, sounding the Emperor’s name with such instruments is appropriate. But how can striking them in play also yield merit? This \"play\" does not refer to reckless or frivolous behavior. It may include practicing ritual music, or the actions of children or the ignorant who, unknowingly or mistakenly, sound ritual instruments or resonant objects, or those who, in leisure, take delight in playing such objects.\n\nThe \"Emperor’s name\" is not merely a personal name. The Emperor’s sacred title is imperishable across kalpas, an eternal and supreme name—hence it is called a \"sacred name.\" Today, when we praise the Buddha’s \"great name\" or \"sacred title,\" it carries the same meaning. When the wind touches resonant objects and sound issues forth, all beings near or far who hear it shall have their karmic obstructions purified.\n\n**Textual Verification:**\nThe ancients created music to harmonize gods and humans, to unite high and low. How much more so for the Emperor’s sacred title, the glorious name of the Primordial Ancestor? Those who hear it are filled with reverence, and the vibration of the Dharma sound carries boundless divine efficacy. When the Great Shun composed music, even the beasts danced in unison—how much more so for humans? People grow solemn at the sound of weapons, amused at the sound of toys, and serene at the sound of the zither—how much more so for the Dharma sound? This applies to all resonant objects, not just ritual instruments. Ritual instruments are used to revere and commune with the divine, to unify the minds of the assembly. When the Emperor’s sacred name is inscribed upon them, those who hear it are moved to reverence, and their sins are extinguished.\n\nKarmic obstructions are the retribution for the wicked. Upon hearing the Dharma sound, a virtuous heart stirs within, and thus all karmic obstructions are eradicated, and purity is attained. The sound of thunder, which inspires awe and reverence in those who hear it, serves as evidence.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nIn the present age, many hang banners and inscribe the Emperor’s sacred name upon ritual instruments and resonant objects, and many witness or hear them—yet their karmic obstructions remain. Why? Those who inscribe the name do not do so with the true and sincere heart of one who upholds the scripture. Those who witness or hear it regard it as commonplace, their obstinate minds unchanged, even to the point of disdain, frivolity, or blasphemy. Without a virtuous heart, how can sins be absolved?\n\nAlas! The scripture and the Emperor’s sacred name possess immeasurable merit. First, one must uphold the scripture with true sincerity to transform oneself—then, without action, reverence arises; without words, faith is born. Only then, by propagating the Emperor’s sacred name to others, can one attain eternal benefit.\n\n**Chapter 34 (Continued: Merits of Upholding the Scripture)**\n\nFurthermore, if one who upholds this scripture awakens to the cycle of life and death, retreats deep into the mountains and forests to cultivate the Dao, and at times ascends to gaze upon the landscape—wherever their eyes alight, whether upon mountains, forests, streams, or valleys, all sentient beings—those with form and without, born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation, crawling, flying, or hidden creatures of every kind—shall have their karmic offenses eradicated, their bodies and minds purified, and upon death, ascend to heaven.\n\nHow much more so for one who receives and upholds this scripture? Know that such a person is the very embodiment of the *Daozang*’s merit and power.\n\nThis further expounds the efficacy of upholding the scripture. To awaken to the cycle of life and death—life and death are matters of great consequence, their principles most difficult to fathom. We are born from the essence and blood of our parents, receiving the principle and *qi* of Heaven and Earth; yet why we live remains unknown. When essence is depleted and *qi* dispersed, spirit departs and form withers; yet why we die remains unknown. Though one may grasp the vicissitudes of affairs, observe the principles of things, speak with clarity, and act without delusion, without knowing life and death, one has not truly awakened. But if one who upholds this scripture severs attachment to sageliness and abandons cunning, removes the two obstacles, severs all delusions, dissolves karmic nature, attains great enlightenment, verifies the Three Origins, and ascends to the highest realm—awakening to the root of life and death—this is what the Buddhist school calls thorough awakening.\n\nTo retreat deep into the mountains and forests—of old, it was said: \"The lesser hermit dwells in the mountains.\" Yet if one has awakened, whether on lofty peaks or level plains, all is a Daoist sanctuary; why must one enter the mountains and forests? The greater hermit dwells in the marketplace—this, too, is principle. But renowned mountains and sublime landscapes, where the land is numinous and people outstanding, are where true cultivators, though they may have no intent for mountain forests, find secluded peaks and lush groves, fashioned by Heaven and Earth as immortal realms. Thus, recluses enter therein.\n\nTo cultivate authenticity and study the Dao—humanity’s true nature is utterly genuine, without falsity; the nature of the Dao is spontaneous, not awaiting study. Yet as emotions and desires daily grow, knowledge is seduced and things transform, the genuine gradually becomes false, and the nature of the Dao obscured. Those who have awakened, in the mountains and beneath the forests, silently cultivate and return to celestial authenticity, studying the great Dao to liberate themselves from the cycle of life and death. The *Daode Jing* says: \"Abandon learning, and there will be no sorrow.\" Yet here it speaks of studying the Dao—why? There, \"abandoning learning\" means forsaking the names, forms, and discriminations of conventional knowledge. Here, \"studying the Dao\" means learning the vast and effortless Way.\n\nIn the Buddhist school, thorough awakening is the highest attainment. Here, only after awakening does one enter the mountains to cultivate authenticity and study the Dao—thus, the gradations of the two traditions may be discerned. At times, those who study the Dao ascend heights and visit waters, traveling through sublime landscapes, gazing in all directions from the mountains. Wherever their eyes alight—whether upon mountains or forests, rivers, streams, ravines, or valleys (valleys being the deep, hollow, and vast gorges of mountains)—all sentient beings, all categories of life imbued with the intent of the great Creator, whether formed or formless (formed being those already born; formless, those not yet born—though some are born yet lack visible form), whether born from womb or egg, from moisture or transformation, crawling, flying, or hidden creatures—all beings stirred by the great Creation, moving or still, soaring high or lurking deep, those that walk between the flying and the hidden, every kind of creature—all their karmic offenses, past and present, are eradicated. Their bodies and minds become pure, free from entanglements, and at death, they all ascend to heaven.\n\nIf the mere gaze of a cultivator can deliver and save beings to such an extent, how much more so for one who receives and upholds this scripture? Know that the merit of such a person is boundless, the very treasury of the great Dao, immeasurable in its power—this is the embodiment of great merit and virtue. For those who study the Dao, their hearts are vast with compassion, and their benevolence knows no bounds. Though unseen and unheard, their minds cannot be perceived; yet wherever their gaze falls, all beings, moved by their intent to cherish life and recognize the dharma-nature in all, are silently spiritually delivered and rescued from the world. Thus, all are saved. Such is their merit.\n\nThe Confucian classics say: \"Achieve the center and harmony, and the myriad things will be nurtured.\" They also speak of establishing a numinous terrace to observe vapors and omens, discern calamities and blessings, and harmoniously complete the myriad things, aiding and assisting their transformation. Where Heaven and Earth cannot reach, they enable beings to accept their lives and deaths in accord with the correct mandate, returning to the source of transformation—what karmic offenses could remain?\n\nThose who praise Confucius say: \"In his lifetime, his learning could not be exhausted; through generations, his depths could not be fathomed.\" That which is beyond knowing is called the divine. Now, in praising those who cultivate authenticity and study the Dao, we say: \"the embodiment of the *Daozang*’s merit and power.\" This, too, speaks of that which is all-embracing, unfathomably profound, and beyond all praise. Only those who contemplate this scripture and attain realization will understand this meaning.\n\n**Chapter 35 (Continued: Merits of Upholding the Scripture)**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Jade Emperor of the Void: \"Now, I have briefly spoken, yet have not exhausted its wonders. If I were to expound at length, even after kalpas beyond count, the merits of this scripture for those of deluded views, doubts, and unbelief could not be fully expressed.\"\n\nAt that time—*see previous explanation*. The Heavenly Worthy is the Most High, the Primordial Beginning. *Addressed*—to speak to; the Primordial Beginning spoke to the Jade Emperor of the Luminous Void of Heaven. Another name is the Jade Emperor of the Mysterious Void of the Jade Clarity. *Now I have briefly spoken*—here, the Primordial Beginning refers to the time of expounding the scripture. *I*—the Primordial Beginning’s self-reference. *Briefly spoken*—to speak in broad strokes. *Not exhausted its wonders*—not fully expressed the essential wonders of the Dao and the supreme merits and virtues.\n\n\"Were I to expound at length, this scripture’s discourse on the merits of upholding it would extend to benefiting people and all beings, the living and the deceased, the formed and the formless, oneself and others, heaven and earth—truly vast in scope. Yet even so, were I to expound at length, the deluded and unbelieving would remain.\n\nWhat is spoken of here encompasses the beings of this world, past and present, the enduring and the perished of heaven and earth, the three thousand great thousandfold worlds without measure, from kalpa to kalpa, kalpas beyond count, this future age, all future ages, from the beginning without beginning to the end without end—whether sentient or insentient, whether perceiving or unperceiving, whether conceivable or inconceivable, whether finite or infinite. All virtues reside within this scripture and those who uphold it. Were one to widely propagate and expound its wonders, still the deluded, those of perverse views, doubts, and unbelief—ordinary worldly folk and the vulgar masses—would persist.\"\n\nAs flowing water cannot rise above its source,\nso too do perverse views—\nviews that are biased and crooked, not upright and grand.\nDoubt arises when wisdom’s vision is incomplete,\nwhen the mind wavers between two possibilities, undecided.\nDelusion stirs from self-serving thoughts,\nentangling the mind in confusion,\nunable to discern right from wrong,\ndisordered and without fixed principle—\nhence they do not believe this scripture holds boundless benefit.\n\nThe virtues of this scripture are beyond expression even across kalpas,\nbeyond enumeration even through measureless kalpas.\nOne might say its virtues are inexpressible even after exhausting all kalpas.\nIn essence, the Primordial Beginning endures eternally,\nkalpas are without end,\nthe scripture’s merits are unfathomable,\nand the Great Dao is immeasurable—\nin the end, words cannot exhaust it.\n\nThe Great Dao is wordless,\nthe wondrous Dharma is imageless,\nthe true scripture is characterless.\nWhat can be bestowed or received,\nseen or heard,\nspoken or attained—\nthese are but secondary meanings.\n\nThus, the Most High has transformed and given birth across measureless kalpas,\npreached to the twelve thousand heavens,\ntraversed distant lands,\ncomposed millions of scriptures.\nIn one transformation, a thousand seven hundred years,\nhe expounded the scripture over ninety thousand times,\nyet still declared, “I know not its name,”\nand only by force called it the Dao.\n\nConfucius, who carried forward the past and inaugurated the future,\nenlightening ten thousand ages,\nsaid only, “I know nothing.”\nŚākyamuni Buddha preached for forty-nine years,\nheld over three hundred assemblies,\ncomposed the Tripitaka of scriptures, vinaya, and treatises,\nyet said, “What I have now briefly expounded,\nI lack the power to exhaust.”\n\nYan Hui, standing in noble solitude,\npracticed fasting of the mind and sitting in forgetfulness,\nand still said, “Though I wish to follow it,\nI know not the way.”\n\nThis scripture is the root of the ten thousand Dharmas,\nits virtues indeed inexpressible—\nthe supreme merit.\nTo speak of it is impossible.\nEven if spoken,\npeople cannot comprehend it.\n\nThus, the Confucians’ governance through non-action,\nthe Daoists’ true and mysterious virtues,\nthe Buddhists’ offering of body and life,\nthe essential meaning of the Western teachings—\nnone can be transmitted through words.\n\nHow wondrous is the mastery of the wheelwright,\nwhere the mind responds to the hand.\nZhuangzi, master of the Three Teachings,\nthus left what lies beyond the six directions unspoken,\nand did not discuss what lies within them—\nnot because he could not speak,\nbut because words easily give rise to delusion,\nand silence is better.\n\nThis is the meaning behind the Master’s rare words on fate,\nand why the nature of the Dao cannot be heard.\n\nThe Buddha spoke of many worlds and their appearances,\ndividing matters and principles—\nsetting aside whether such claims are vast and baseless,\neven if grounded in evidence,\nmuch remains inexpressible.\n\nThose who follow his teachings assume the Buddha spoke what others cannot,\nmistakenly deeming it profound.\nYet the Buddha was born in foreign lands,\namong strange customs and different peoples,\nin remote and petty regions,\nsurrounded by multitudes.\nThe Śākya clan spoke of what they saw,\nbut China knew nothing of it.\nFalsely, they claim the Buddha’s vision was vast.\n\nObserve China:\nwithin a hundred *li*, customs differ.\nFrom Yan to Yue, from Tai to Qi,\nthe mountains, rivers, and winds of north and south—\nthose who have not traversed them cannot know.\nHow much less can the distant Western Regions be thoroughly examined?\nEven with historical records,\nthey are but hearsay and miscellaneous notes—\nwho can guarantee their accuracy?\n\nMany love the strange,\nnot investigating right from wrong.\nIf the Buddha truly knew all,\nwhy did the scriptures he composed not originally enter China in Tang language,\nbut required three translations to become coherent?\nSince he did not know the Tang language or script,\nwhat he spoke must have been for his neighboring lands.\nPerhaps, like Zhuangzi, he used parables to expound the Dao—\nthis too is possible.\n\nYet people, without careful examination,\nerroneously judge high and low—\nhow excessive is their love of the strange!\n\nAlas, to not speak of all realms\nis to avoid deluding people.\nTo briefly speak of its transformative power\nis to enlighten their ignorance,\nreveal the true intent,\nand manifest the true Dharma—\nthis is how the Dao brings real benefit.\n\nScholars must diligently investigate it.\n\n*Chapter on Virtues, Continuation of the Thirty-Sixth*\n\nAt that time, the Jade Sovereign of the Void, having heard these words, was filled with joy and exultation beyond measure. Gazing upon the compassionate countenance of the Heavenly Worthy, he bowed in reverence and offered praise, reciting these verses:\n\nAbove the Nine Heavens lies the Great Veil,\nWhere jade capital and golden palaces stand,\nCloud-layers towering, majestic and grand.\n\nWithin resides the Heavenly Emperor,\nBoundless in kindness, grace, and harmony,\nWhose Way is matchless, subduing all demons.\nCelestial treasures and sacred talismans,\nJade statutes and golden canons,\nCountless immortals and divine banners.\n\nThose who hear this name shall have their sins erased,\nForever freed from the river of desire.\nHe is called the Jade Emperor,\nThe True Ancient of the Vaulted Sky,\nPerfect in subtlety, pure and clear,\nWisdom vast and eloquence profound.\nThe Way most supreme, the Honored One,\nTeacher of the Three Realms,\nPrimal Ancestor of the Undifferentiated,\nUnsurpassed Lord,\nCompassionate Father of the Four Modes of Birth,\nExalted Sage of the Highest Heaven,\nGreatly Kind and Benevolent One.\n\nHis ten titles complete,\nMyriad virtues suffuse his being,\nLimitless in delivering beings,\nLifting them from the suffering of birth and death.\n\nWhen the Jade Sovereign of the Void had recited these verses and the ten titles, all the sages and divine hosts of the heavens, with one voice, marveled at what they had never before encountered. This speaks to the reverence and joy of receiving the scripture.\n\nAt the moment when the Heavenly Worthy concluded the chapter on the divine incantation’s virtues, the Jade Sovereign of the Void, having heard these words, was overcome with joy and exultation, his heart leaping with boundless delight. Gazing upon the compassionate countenance of the Jade Emperor, he bowed in reverence and offered verses of praise:\n\nAbove the Nine Heavens lies the Great Veil,\nWhere jade capital and golden palaces stand—\nas previously described.\nCloud-layers towering, towering,\nlofty and grand indeed.\nThe Great Veil’s golden palaces,\ndharma-clouds and auspicious radiance,\nlayer upon boundless layer,\nmajestic and towering,\ntheir vastness immeasurable.\n\nAmidst rosy clouds, the jade capital’s palaces rise high and steep.\nWithin dwells the Heavenly Emperor,\nthe Jade Emperor, Lord of the Myriad Heavens.\nBoundless in kindness, grace, and harmony—\nhis kindness is not mere favoritism,\nbut through kalpas of creation,\nall beings are endowed,\nnothing withheld, hence called kindness.\nHis Way and virtue are invincible,\nsubduing all demons.\nCelestial treasures and sacred talismans—\nthe wondrous, mysterious talismans of the heavens.\nJade statutes and golden canons—\nthe celestial precepts and golden codes.\nCountless immortals,\nthe divine hosts attending the throne,\nhundreds of thousands of myriads,\nwith dharma-banners and jeweled standards as their retinue,\ntheir numbers beyond measure.\n\nThose who hear his name and the sound of the Dharma\nshall have their sins wholly extinguished,\nforever freed from the river of desire.\nOf all karmic bonds of sentient beings,\nnone are harder to sever than attachment.\nThrough kalpas they drift and sink,\nunable to escape at once.\nTo be forever freed from the river of desire\nis to sever the roots of karma.\n\nHe is called the Jade Emperor—\nas previously described.\nThe True Ancient of the Vaulted Sky—\nthe boundless vault of heaven,\nthe immeasurable azure expanse,\nthe True Ancient without beginning.\nPerfect in subtlety, pure and clear—\nwondrously complete, truly pure.\nWisdom vast and eloquence profound—\ngreat wisdom, great discernment,\nsubtle eloquence, vast talent.\nThe Way most supreme, the Honored One—\nthe Way without limit, the Honored One without peer.\nTeacher of the Three Realms—\nthe master of the realms of heaven, earth, and humanity.\nPrimal Ancestor of the Undifferentiated—\nbefore the beginning, before heaven and earth divided,\nbefore the world existed,\nthe Emperor’s true essence endured,\nthe true source through kalpas,\nhence called the Primal Ancestor of the Undifferentiated.\nUnsurpassed Lord—\nof the Three Teachings and myriad Dharmas,\nno sage can compare,\nall acknowledge him as Lord,\nhence called the Unsurpassed.\nCompassionate Father of the Four Modes of Birth—\nthe four modes: womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and transformation-born.\nAll rely on the Emperor’s virtue to be born and to mature,\nto have a good beginning and a good end,\nall aided by the Dao,\nhence called the Compassionate Father of the Four Modes of Birth.\nExalted Sage of the Highest Heaven—\namong all heavens, none is higher than the Great Veil Heaven,\namong all immortals and buddhas, none is more exalted than the Jade Emperor,\nhence called the Exalted Sage of the Highest Heaven.\nGreatly Kind and Benevolent One—\nboundless in great kindness and great benevolence.\n\nHis ten titles complete—\nfrom the Vaulted Sky to the Benevolent One, ten titles in all.\nThe Jade Emperor’s virtues and divine works\nare thus perfectly complete and fulfilled.\nMyriad virtues suffuse his being—\nthe Emperor’s virtues are boundless,\nthis is called \"myriad virtues suffuse his being\" as a concise expression.\nLimitless in delivering beings,\nlifting them from the suffering of birth and death.\n\nAt that time, when the Jade Sovereign of the Void had recited these verses and the ten titles, all the sages and divine hosts of the heavens, with one voice, marveled at what they had never before encountered. Having heard this wondrous Dharma and the sacred titles of supreme virtue—rarely met even through kalpas—the divine hosts together voiced their joy, for they had never witnessed such a marvel. Some say: in the world, nothing like this has ever been seen.\n\nSuch are the virtues and merits of the Emperor. Those who study this scripture shall awaken to true cultivation and not feel ashamed.\n\n*Collected Annotations on the August Scripture, Volume Seven Concluded*\n*Collected Annotations on the August Scripture, Volume Eight*\n*Highest Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Deeds, Volume Three*\n*Chapter Four: Protection by Heavenly Perfected Ones*\n*Chapter One of the Protection Section*\n\nAt that moment, the August Emperor of the Vast Heaven, having heard the scriptural Dharma expounded, rose from his seat and knelt reverently before the Jade Emperor, addressing him thus: \"May the sagely compassion extend universally to the great assembly, to all the devas and humans, and to those who uphold this scripture, that the benefits of this teaching be proclaimed.\"\n\nThereupon, the Jade Emperor of the Most High, moved by expedient intent, opened the gate of beneficence, proclaimed the jade-casket precepts, and transmitted the numinous-treasure Dharma. He addressed the August Emperor of the Vast Heaven, saying: \"Now listen carefully, and I shall expound for you the merits of receiving and upholding this scripture—the wondrous matters of aiding the imperiled, delivering the suffering, and benefiting both the living and the deceased.\"\n\nThe assembled Perfected Ones bowed their heads and spoke in unison: \"Today, we are fortunate to hear the Dharma of serene and ever-abiding truth. Through its power, blessings shall ascend to all the heavens, pervade the Three Realms, and the sufferings of the Three Paths and Five Torments shall all be extinguished. We beseech your compassion to expound these wondrous principles for our sake.\"\n\nAfter the divine hosts had extolled the merits of the divine incantations and the virtues of the Emperor’s sacred titles, the August Emperor of the Vast Heaven—also known as the August Emperor of the Vast, Lofty, and Mysterious Heaven (not merely the Vast Heaven of ordinary times)—heard the Heavenly Worthy expound the scriptural Dharma. Rising from his own seat, he knelt before the Jade Emperor and petitioned: \"May the supreme sagely compassion extend universally to all in the great assembly\"—or, as some say, to all the divine hosts who hear this scripture, or to the vast multitudes of the world (for though the heavens contain no mortals, this scripture broadly delivers the Three Realms through kalpas of tribulation; both interpretations are valid)—\"and to all the devas and humans who uphold this scripture, that the benefits of this teaching be proclaimed in full.\"\n\nThereupon, the Jade Emperor of the Most High, moved by the sublime intent to deliver all beings, opened the gate of eternal and boundless beneficence, proclaimed the jade-casket precepts—this scripture being enshrined in jade tablets and precious caskets, treasured in the heavens—and transmitted the great Dharma of the Mysterious Numinous Treasure. He addressed the August Emperor of the Vast Heaven, saying: \"Now listen carefully\"—\"you\" refers to the August Emperor of the Vast Heaven, and \"listen carefully\" means to attend with single-minded clarity—\"and I shall expound for you the merits of receiving and upholding this scripture: how it upholds all in peril, rescues all from suffering, and brings wondrous benefits to both the living and the dead.\"\n\nThe assembled Perfected Ones bowed their heads and spoke in unison: \"Today, we are fortunate to hear the Dharma of serene and ever-abiding truth. The nature of humanity is inherently luminous, neither defiled nor pure, neither formed nor destroyed, neither ascending nor sinking, fundamentally serene and ever-abiding. Yet deluded by worldly entanglements, beings bring about their own ruin, drifting and sinking in the cycle of rebirth, blind and ignorant, unable to abide in serenity. Ghosts and spirits, though endowed with consciousness, when their retribution is exhausted, are reborn in turn and likewise cannot abide in serenity. Now, through the merits and benefits of hearing this scripture, our original nature is restored, the roots and dust are purified, karmic consciousness is uprooted, sins and obstacles are eradicated, and firmness and perfection are attained. To hear the Dharma of serene and ever-abiding truth is a rare encounter across ages—how could we not count ourselves fortunate? The power of this Dharma bestows blessings upon all the heavens and realms, pervading the Three Realms.\" (See previous explanations.)\n\nThe Three Paths: the celestial path, the terrestrial path, and the aquatic path. The Five Sufferings: suffering of the mind from the burden of form, suffering of the spirit from the burden of attachment, suffering of the body from the burden of greed, suffering of the soul from the burden of the self, and suffering of the essence from the allure of sensory realms—all are dissolved and extinguished.\n\nWe only pray that the Most Venerable One, in compassion and pity, may take mercy upon us. *Pity: to show compassion, sympathy, and care.* Expound these wondrous principles.\n\nThis scripture is the most sublime and wondrous Dharma, and thus possesses such merit and virtue. The August Heavenly Thearch, though not seeking its profound essence, requests its blessings—not to drink from another’s cup of grace. Every word and stroke of this scripture is an immeasurable Dharma treasure. To know its efficacy and uphold it with a true heart is to not betray the compassion of those who preach the scripture.\n\n**Chapter Two of the Protective Upholding**\n\nThe Jade Emperor proclaimed: Should any being honor and support their parents, revere the Three Treasures, devote loyalty to their sovereign, refrain from killing or stealing, avoid licentiousness and jealousy, forsake anger and resentment, abandon arrogance and deceit, observe precepts and maintain purity, contemplate the Great Dao with a tranquil mind, and hold this scripture in reverence, I shall command the following:\n\nDispatch throughout the Dharma realms and transmit across the boundless worlds in the ten directions. Command the Eastern Emperor Lord of Azure Radiance, the Azure Rider, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Southeastern Great Emperor of Fusang, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Southern Great Emperor of Vermilion Mound, the Crimson Rider, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Southwestern Primordial Elder of Great Flower, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Western August Numinous Sovereign Elder, the White Rider, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Northwestern August Heavenly Thearch, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Northern Emperor Lord of Purple Tenuity, the Black Rider, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Northeastern Heavenly Lord of Impenetrable Void, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Supreme Heavenly Thearch of the Upper Realm, the Yellow Rider of Kunlun’s Ancient One, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Heavenly Lord of Harmonious Advent from the Lower Realm, with the divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts of the famous mountains and grotto-heavens, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nThe Jade Emperor proclaimed: Upholding the scripture is not merely reciting it with the mouth. If any being in the world honors and serves their parents, reveres the Dao, scriptures, and masters of the Three Treasures, exhausts their strength and whole heart in utmost loyalty to their sovereign, refrains from killing, stealing, or licentiousness, forsakes jealousy, anger, resentment, arrogance, and deceit, receives and observes the pure and mysterious precepts of the Daoist canon, maintains true and proper fasting, avoids negligence and impatience, abides in tranquility and equanimity, silently follows nature, nurtures the spirit in stillness, models themselves after Heaven to solidify their true nature, contemplates the Great Dao with a profound mind, reveres the August Heaven as if it were present, and holds the Dao and its scriptures in esteem and veneration—\n\nIt is also said: One must cultivate strict reverence without carelessness, uphold, recite, and chant this scripture.\n\n*I, the Jade Emperor, speak of myself. Read as \"We.\"*\n\nThen command the dispatch throughout all worlds and Dharma realms, transmitting across the boundless worlds in the ten directions. Command the Eastern Emperor Lord of Azure Radiance, the Azure Rider; the Southern Great Emperor of Vermilion Mound, the Crimson Rider; the Western August Numinous Sovereign Elder, the White Rider; the Northern Emperor Lord of Purple Tenuity, the Black Rider; and their divine immortals and celestial troops.\n\nThe Southeastern Great Emperor of Fusang, the Southwestern Primordial Elder of Great Flower, and the Northwestern August Heavenly Thearch belong to the Qian direction. The Northeastern Heavenly Lord of Impenetrable Void and the Supreme Heavenly Thearch of the Upper Realm—this is not the Celestial Thearch of the Curved Array, but the deity who governs Heaven. *The Buddha calls him the Heavenly Lord Śakra.* The Yellow Rider of Kunlun’s Ancient One and the Heavenly Lord of Harmonious Advent from the Lower Realm, along with the divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts of the famous mountains and grotto-heavens, are all commanded to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\n*To shield: to protect, cherish, and uphold.* Those who uphold the scripture respect and honor the words of the Emperor and the Dao, aligning their virtue with Heaven and the Dao to merge with the true. They embody the Great Dao. Where the Dao resides, both gods and humans revere it; thus, the Emperor commands the sacred hosts of the ten directions to shield them. Yet this applies only to those who are loyal, filial, reverent, and observe the precepts against killing, stealing, licentiousness, and deceit.\n\nUpholding the scripture is rooted in virtuous conduct. Contemplate the Dao with a profound mind, and the Dao will naturally return to you. Some say that Daoists who leave the household do not draw near to sovereign or kin, deeming them disloyal and unfilial. Yet they do not understand that the mysterious precepts of the Daoist gate are most strict—those who observe and cultivate them dare not violate the precepts, lest they harm their bodies and shame their kin. With utmost sincerity and firmness, they first repay the Four Gratitudes. How could they ever forget their sovereign or kin, or fail in loyalty and filial piety? Thus, the Perfected Lord Xu permitted the *Scripture of Pure Brightness on Loyalty and Filial Piety* to reveal the true loyalty and filial piety of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Three of the Protective Upholding**\n\nCommand all Golden Immortals of the ten directions, the Four Assemblies, the Eight Divisions, and all their retinues to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand all Heavenly Perfected Great Sages, Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Three Officials, the Four Saints, the Two Luminaries, the Nine Stars, the Northern Dipper, the Southern Dipper, the Eastern Dipper, the Western Dipper, the Central Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, all the stars of the celestial sphere, the Vajra Warriors, the Divine Kings, and their respective hosts to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand all Golden Immortals of the ten directions across the worlds. The Golden Immortals are the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The Four Assemblies are not the Four Assemblies of the mundane world, but the Four Assemblies of yin-yang spirits, divine generals, and soldiers. The Eight Divisions are explained in the second fascicle. And their retinues refer to the kin and followers of the Four Assemblies and Eight Divisions. The Heavenly Perfected Great Sages of the ten directions are the Great Sages among the hosts of Perfected Ones in the ten directions. The Flying Heavenly Divine Kings are explained previously. The Three Officials are Heaven, Earth, and Water. The Four Saints are Heavenly Marshal Peng, Heavenly Marshal You, the Illustrious Sage, and the Protective Sage. The Two Luminaries are the sun and moon. The Nine Stars are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Moon Comet, Purple Qi, Rāhu, and Ketu. The Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western, and Central Dippers are the Five Dippers. The Twenty-Eight Constellations are Horn, Neck, Root, Chamber, Heart, Tail, Winnowing Basket, Dipper, Ox, Girl, Emptiness, Rooftop, Encampment, Wall, Straddler, Bond, Stomach, Mane, Net, Turtle Beak, Orion, Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wings, and Chariot, along with all the stars of the celestial sphere. The Vajra Warriors, Divine Kings, and their respective hosts are all the generals and their divisions. Each with their respective subordinates. Verification:\n\nBy imperial decree, this scripture is promulgated by the court’s command. The Three Dukes, Four Ministers, officials of the Two Capitals and Nine Courts, all functionaries and attendants, noble kinsmen and foreign clans, the myriad multitudes of black-haired people—none fail to revere and uphold it. Those who receive and maintain this Jade Scripture under the shelter of the host of spirits do so by imperial mandate to honor the worthy and assist the virtuous.\n\nWithin the human body reside the Three Origins, Four Symbols, Two Qi, Nine Palaces, Five Phases, and the degrees of the Twenty-Eight Constellations. The warp and weft of the celestial sphere, the waters and fires of true resolve, great wisdom, cultivation of conduct, vigorous practice, wondrous Dharma, and meritorious deeds—together with the host of spirits—constitute the entirety of a person. From the body’s hair and skin to its flesh, blood, and marrow; from its sinews and bones to its spirit and qi; from its essence and radiance to its meridians and collaterals, all serve to sustain our true qi of correct nature, wherein the treasure of life is preserved.\n\nThis true qi of correct nature is none other than the imperial true scripture. The thirty-six thousand spirits and qi, the eighty-four thousand luminous pores—these are the immortals and perfected beings of the ten directions, the Vajra Warriors, stellar deities, and divine kings with their legions. As the *Scripture of Disaster Dispelling* states: “There are hundreds of millions of celestial perfected beings and Vajra Warriors who guard and protect this scripture”—such is its meaning.\n\nThe scripture does not reside in words or written signs; its true import lies within our hearts. The spirits do not dwell in the ten-directional worlds but within our very selves.\n\nTo cultivate the heart and refine the body does not lie in recitation or perusal, but in silent operation with utmost sincerity, free from self-interest. When spirit, essence, and qi are whole, sageliness may be learned, Heaven may be aspired to, and the Dao may be entered—every movement shall be auspicious, and the spirits will surely protect one. If the Three Treasures are depleted and the One True [Nature] is lost, one’s own spirits wane and qi weakens, essence fails to flourish, and one falls into opposition with Heaven—how could the spirits protect such a one?\n\nAlas, all are human: the noble one cultivates and meets with fortune, while the petty one rebels and meets with misfortune. Thus the scripture states: those who uphold and protect this scripture shall know that Heaven bestows blessings upon the virtuous. The imperial virtue is boundless, and the scripture’s benefits are supreme—it depends solely on how one reveres and receives it.\n\n**Chapter on Protection and Upholding (IV)**\nBy imperial decree, the Vajra Warriors of Subduing Demons, the Four Heavenly Gate Kings, the deities of the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, all renowned mountains, the Four Seas and Nine Rivers, the Twelve River Sources, mountains and forests, rivers and marshes—all their lords and retinues—are commanded to shelter and protect those who receive and uphold this scripture, ensuring their safety in all perilous places.\n\nBy imperial decree, all local earth spirits, ditch and canal deities, and all mighty ghost kings are commanded to shelter and protect those who receive and uphold this scripture.\n\nThe Twelve River Sources are here recorded as thirteen names, for two waters share a single source—hence they are called the Twelve River Sources.\n\nBy imperial decree, the Demon-Subduing Kings and Heavenly Ding Warriors are commanded.\n\nThe Four Heavenly Gate Kings are the kings of the eastern, southern, western, and northern heavenly gates. The Five Marchmounts are Mount Tai in the east, Mount Heng in the south, Mount Hua in the west, Mount Heng in the north, and Mount Song in the center. The Four Waterways are the deities of the Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Ji Rivers. All renowned mountains in the world are included. The Four Seas are the eastern, western, southern, and northern seas. The Nine Rivers are the Yangzi, Qiantang, Hanshui, Xunyang, Huntong, Jinjiang, Xiangjiang, Wulong, and Yalu, along with all other rivers. The Twelve River Sources refer to the Yellow River as the world’s pulse—its origins include Kunlun, Yumen, Star Constellation Sea, Huodunnao’er, Weilu, and the sources of the Faxie River. Another account states that the Yellow River’s source at Kunlun has nine wells and seven springs, not merely twelve. The Twelve River Sources refer to Yu’s dredging of the Nine Rivers, along with the Ru, Han, Huai, and Si Rivers, totaling twelve. The Nine Rivers are the Tuhai, Taishi, Majia, Fufu, Husu, Jianjie, Goupan, Gejin, Ru, Han, Huai, and Si—these are the Twelve River Sources. The Yellow River is the general spirit of all rivers. Rivers such as the Jing, Wei, Yi, Wen, Zhen, Wei, Hutuo, Xingqia, Weak Water, and all others are its tributaries.\n\nMountains and forests encompass all in the world. Rivers and marshes encompass all in the world. Flowing waters are called *chuan*; marshes are watery expanses. \"All lords\" refers to the spirits presiding over mountains, forests, rivers, and marshes, along with their retinues, who shelter and protect those who receive and uphold this scripture. In all dangerous and treacherous places, they ensure safety and stability for those who uphold the scripture.\n\nWherever the imperial decree reaches, all local earth spirits and responsive numina, along with ditch and canal deities—where a ditch is a waterless channel, whether in mountains or earth, and a canal is a water-filled channel—and all other minor spirits, as well as all mighty ghost kings, are commanded to shelter and protect those who receive and uphold this scripture.\n\nThe scripture’s dharma decree is revered by all immortals, upheld by all buddhas, practiced by all heavens, venerated by all spirits, and recited by all people—even demonic forces submit of their own accord. Truly, mountains are thus stilled, waters thus flow long, and protection is thus strict. Since those who uphold the scripture are guarded by all spirits, how could they dare be negligent? A single lapse brings profound transgression and grave offense.\n\nHow well Confucius said: \"The petty person does not know the Mandate of Heaven and thus does not stand in awe of it.\" To treat the great with familiarity, to mock the words of sages—such is the petty person. In viewing this scripture, one must still take warning and exert oneself.\n\n**Chapter on Protection and Upholding (V)**\n\nLet all demonic heresies be utterly subdued, their forms concealed and traces hidden, soaring high beyond the seas or fleeing far to other lands. Thus shall the spirits of mountains and forests, altars of the earth, and temple deities that partake of blood offerings all vanish of their own accord. The plague-bearing demon marshals of the five directions, all malevolent spirits, wind kings and water monsters, sinful dragons of karmic clamor, earth sprites and water specters—all shall dissolve away. The fivefold emptiness and sixfold depletion, disturbances in dreams, wild curses, hexes, and poisons—all shall dissipate on their own. For those who uphold this scripture, every desire of the heart shall be fulfilled, every wish granted in full.\n\n*[Note: 慑 is pronounced \"nie.\"]*\n\n\"Let all demonic heresies\" refers to the command to subdue and eradicate them. \"Demonic heresies\" include heavenly demons, earthly demons, demon kings, demon folk, and demon women. \"Heresies\" encompass lewd doctrines, heterodox teachings, deviant practices, miscellaneous arts, and lesser techniques—such as the three thousand six hundred private methods, the ninety-six schools, and the thirty-six thousand varieties. \"Let\" signifies the imperial decree to suppress and eliminate them, ensuring all are thoroughly subdued.\n\nAll—this means entirely. *Nie* (慑) signifies awe and reverent submission. *Fu* (伏) denotes restraint and yielding compliance. They conceal their forms and flee their traces. *Qian* (潜) means to hide, concealing their shapes so they dare not appear. *Dun* (遁) means to evade, escaping their shadows so they dare not linger. Though the forms of these demons may outwardly seem enchanting, their illusions strangely beautiful, their true nature is obstructive and cannot be shown to others. The true methods of this scripture shatter the courage of ghosts and crush the hearts of demons; no demon can escape its scrutiny. Fearing the profound power of its divine teachings, they dare not remain, lest their foul essence be exposed. The words of heterodox teachings seek to confuse the truth. Yet when the true Dao is practiced, deviant doctrines fade; when the great Way is revered, lesser paths are abandoned. Once the imperial decree is proclaimed, none dare harbor them. They soar beyond the seas, their demonic ways leaving no trace—this may be described as \"flying.\" But how can heterodox teachings \"fly\" upon entering the ear? They transform the heart and alter thoughts, turning toward the Dao and forgetting self-interest. \"Soaring beyond the seas\" is a common expression, akin to \"the soul flying beyond the heavens\" or \"the spirit scattering to the nine skies.\" They flee to distant lands, daring not remain in their former abodes.\n\nThus, all spirits of mountains and forests, altars to earth and grain, shrines and temples, and those who partake of blood sacrifices shall dissipate on their own. *Mountains and forests*—explained previously. *She* (社) is the earth deity; *ji* (稷) is the grain deity. *Ci* (祠) means to administer or to sacrifice, where the spirit presides and is invoked in prayer. *Miao* (庙) means to attend, where spirits are honored in the temple with morning rites—those who receive offerings of blood and sacrificial wine. These are all spirits deemed worthy of worship, yet how can they be made to dissipate on their own? Spirits that demand sacrifices must be unjust; people who flatter spirits must be unrighteous.\n\nThus, Master Sa the Perfected subdued Marshal Wang Lingguan and reformed the forbidden city gods; when Ximen Bao governed Jizhou, he cast the witches into the river to restrain the river deity. How much more, then, when evil spirits falsely assume divine forms to delude people, and people revere such evil to deceive the world? When Hu Ying administered Guangdong, he destroyed illusory Buddhas, slew the serpent demon, and beat the monks to liberate the foolish masses from their delusions. Now, it is said that all ghosts and spirits shall dissipate on their own—those who uphold this scripture’s decree shall neither invite misfortune nor fortune, and shall dwell in peace, free from threats or clamor.\n\nThe plague-spreading demon marshals of the five directions, all malevolent ghosts and spirits—whether the fierce ghosts and overbearing deities of the world, the wind-controlling kings, the aquatic monsters, the violent dragons, the perverse and inauspicious spirits, the earth spirits and tree specters—shall all vanish of their own accord. The five deficiencies and six depletions—where the five viscera (spirit, qi, blood, and body) grow weak, and the six pulses decline—shall cease, along with disordered dreams and restless souls. Alternatively, the five deficiencies and six depletions refer to celestial omens like Heaven’s Wailing and Ruin, along with baleful stars such as Sangmen, Tai Sui, Great Depletion, Lesser Depletion, Fei Kang, Kong Wang, Yellow Pennant, Leopard’s Tail, Nine Fruits, Red Mouth, White Tongue, and the malevolent spirits of curses, oaths, hexes, and poisons—all such base practices, heterodox ways, incantations, and demonic speech, whether cursed or sworn, shall likewise dissipate.\n\nFor those who uphold this scripture with sincere devotion, all desires and aspirations shall be fulfilled as their hearts wish, without hindrance or opposition. The virtuous and those who walk the Dao command the reverence of ghosts and spirits, while all inauspicious and perverse forces are dispelled. Witness the death of the ominous mulberry, the expulsion of pestilence by the catalpa staff, the subduing of the flood dragon by Zheng Yang, the vanquishing of demons by the Celestial Master, and the binding of ghosts by the Sa Patriarch—all these bear clear testament. Alas, Wang Yanfang was a man of valor; even bandits, when sentenced to execution, dared not let Yanfang learn of their heterodox ways, for his virtue was as resounding as a bell.\n\nYet the three corpses, five burdens, seven emotions, six desires, and nine consciousnesses within a person—when these lower evils wreak havoc, they deceive one into failing to correct oneself, allowing perverse forces to persist and inauspicious influences to linger. If one can rectify their path, sever the three corpses, eliminate the five burdens, purge the emotions and desires, and expel the nine consciousnesses’ evils, then their personal aspirations shall be fulfilled, external perils shall vanish, and misfortune shall scatter while fortune arrives.\n\n**Chapter on Upholding the Six Precepts**\nEven those who cannot yet follow the ritual codes and observe fasts or jiao offerings may still uphold purity and precepts, maintain unwavering faith, and revere this scripture with devotion—such persons are equal to those who perform the fasts. Those who uphold pure precepts shall find their merit unimpeded, their virtue unobstructed, and they shall be called sages among men, their wisdom and power ever-renewed, akin to the perfected immortals.\n\nFor those who receive and uphold this scripture in accordance with the Dao, their merit shall be immeasurable. Even if one cannot yet follow the profound ritual codes and perform grand jiao offerings, so long as they maintain purity without defilement, uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion, and observe the Daoist commandments—whether the Five Precepts, Eight Precepts, Twelve Precepts (as appropriate), Eighteen Precepts, Twenty-Four Precepts, Thirty-Six Precepts, Seventy-Two Precepts, One Hundred Twenty Precepts, One Hundred Eighty Precepts, Three Hundred Great Precepts, or the Six Hundred Pure Precepts for female Daoists—if they focus their will, uphold these precepts with unwavering resolve, and revere this scripture with sincere faith, they shall be counted among those who perform the fasts. Those who uphold pure precepts in this way shall find their merit unimpeded.\n\nEven those who cannot yet follow the ritual codes, perform fasts or jiao offerings, or maintain purity while revering the scriptures—if they can uphold purity, maintain single-minded faith, and revere this scripture with devotion—are all equal to those who perform the fasts and uphold pure precepts. The merit of those who cannot yet follow the ritual codes but perform fasts or jiao offerings, or those who revere the scriptures with purity, is the same. The gods shall respect and protect those who uphold these pure precepts.\n\nAlternatively, if one maintains purity and single-minded devotion in upholding their precepts, their merit shall be unimpeded. \"Unimpeded\" means level and vast. If the heart is divided, merit cannot be genuine. If precepts are not upheld, merit is tarnished. When body and mind are pure, precepts are upheld with devotion, faith is sincere, the scripture is revered, the heart is undefiled, and resolve is unwavering—without deficiency or hindrance—then merit is true and naturally unimpeded. What obstacle could remain? They shall dwell in freedom and ease.\n\nHuman nature is born free and unconfined. Yet beset by worldly cares and material burdens, one toils in ceaseless hardship, no longer at ease—how can there be joy? With purity and right faith, free from material burdens, one attains great freedom, ever joyful and carefree. Such a one is called a sage among men—not merely a carefree person. With purity and right faith, rising above the common throng, they are called a sage among men. Their virtue and wisdom ever renew, cultivated with growing insight; transformation aligns with the heart, perception is true and wisdom profound, worldly burdens fade and true nature abides in clarity. Virtue daily renews, wisdom daily brightens—this is virtue and wisdom ever new. Together with the perfected ones—those of pure and right faith who uphold the scriptures and attain the Dao, the celestial perfected—such is the meaning of purity, precept-holding, single-minded devotion, reverence, and unwavering respect. Without thought of merit or intent to impress, one acts without ulterior motive, utterly free from pretense or interruption. This is what Confucius meant by \"even in haste or during a meal, never deviating,\" and what the *Doctrine of the Mean* describes as \"finding fulfillment in every circumstance.\" Zhuangzi expounded the essence of *carefree wandering*, Hai Chan composed the *Song of Joy*, Buddhism speaks of *great freedom*, and the Confucian classics speak of *daily renewal*—all are natural effects. How could they be borrowed or forced?\n\nAlas! Purity and right faith, even without relying on ritual codes or performing fasts and jiao offerings, possess this natural merit. Thus, the profound teachings of the Dao lie in truly embodying the scriptures' meaning. Ritual codes and jiao offerings merely propagate the Dharma to spread the Dao’s transformation. Chen Tuan chanted the *Scripture of Salvation* and attained the Dao—this was truly upholding the scripture’s essence. Today’s jiao offerings lack evident efficacy because they possess grand rituals but no true cultivation. If purity and right faith are combined with jiao offerings, their merit is greatly enhanced. Without jiao offerings, true sincerity alone still yields divine merit. But without true sincerity, jiao offerings become mere formalities—how could they avoid fault?\n\n**Chapter on Upholding the Sevenfold Merit**\n\nAt that time, the August Heavenly Emperor, having heard these words, bowed before the Emperor and chanted:\n\nGreat is the Supreme Dao, formless and nameless.\nVast through countless eons, the Yellow Dao opens in clarity.\nDivine clarity shines radiant, the Nine Qi emit their essence.\nJade Void gleams pure, the Great Rosy Clouds rise in brilliance.\nThe Jade Emperor unfolds transformation, universally delivering heaven and humanity.\nThe

infinite, universally oversee deliverance.\nEvil roots severed, names recorded in the Mystic Capital.\nThe assembled perfected array, heed the Emperor’s words.\nThis scripture is the Emperor’s decree: those who recite and uphold it\nshall reach the Dao’s shore, untouched by calamity.\nBy the Emperor’s command, all shall obey.\n\nAt that time—referring to the aforementioned merits of upholding—\nthe August Heavenly Emperor, having heard these words, bowed before the Jade Emperor and chanted in praise:\n\nGreat is the Supreme Dao, measureless and unattainable.\nFormless and nameless, unseen and unheard—even its name is but a forced designation.\nVast through countless eons, without beginning or end,\nthrough innumerable kalpas—\"a hundred thousand\" is called *yi*, but this merely denotes vast numbers, for in truth they are without count.\nThe Yellow Dao opens in clarity, an auspicious time of celestial harmony.\nDivine clarity shines radiant, the divine wind eternally pure, luminous and bright.\nThe Nine Qi emit their essence—the Nine Qi of Fusion, Flame, Evolution, Vastness, Radiance, Dao, Chaos, Cavern, and Vastness.\nAs the Yellow Dao opens and inauspicious omens dissolve, the Nine Qi display their brilliance, emitting their essence in wondrous splendor.\nJade Void gleams pure—jade light, empty and bright, serene in its clarity (or: the Heaven of Jade Void shines radiant).\nThe Great Rosy Clouds rise in brilliance, the Great Mystery’s rosy glow, supremely high and luminous.\nThe Jade Emperor unfolds transformation, opening and delivering through teaching.\nUniversally delivering heaven and humanity—*pu* means \"all-encompassing,\" delivering all beings between heaven and earth.\nThe Three Origins nurture the Dao—heaven’s birth, earth’s completion, and humanity’s cultivation are the Three Origins’ nurturing of the Dao.\nThe Two Images embrace life—Qian and Kun’s creation, the generation of all things.\nFrom beginning to end, they govern and shape—thus called the Two Images embracing life.\n(Alternatively: Yin and Yang’s molding is the Two Images embracing life—both are correct.)\nRotten trees and dead roots—*xiu* means \"decayed,\" *gu* means \"dead.\"\nOnce withered, made to flourish—*ku* means \"dried up,\" once desiccated, made to bloom anew.\nAll creatures that creep and breathe, long life and transformed forms—\nflying, crawling, and creeping beings, none die prematurely, all transcend their original forms.\nThose with child or in gestation all achieve birth and completion—\nall beings in gestation, unharmed and unfallen, all attain peaceful growth and fulfillment.\nThe dead, their fate expired, souls return to the Three Clarities—\nthe deceased, spared the underworld, all return to heaven.\nTheir po spirits refined and delivered, ascend to the Southern Palace—\nthe seven po of the dead refined by the Great Compassionate Perfected, their souls and spirits ascend to the Southern Palace.\nToday is most auspicious—referring to the time of the scripture’s recitation.\nAll attain luminosity—all beings are saved, darkness dispelled by light.\nThe Five Emperors reflect and illumine—the Five Emperors of the Five Directions observe and shine.\nUniversally proclaiming to the myriad spirits—\nheavenly gods and earthly deities, all river sources,\nthe Five Peaks and Four Waterways, all famous mountains,\nCaverns of Mystery, Void, Emptiness, and Immortality—\nthe vast and empty caverns, all immortal emperors, gods, and buddhas, and ghostly generals.\n\nThe Boundless Great Sage, the Most Perfect and Revered Divinity—\nlimitless, boundless, measureless in extent.\nUniversally overseeing the salvation of beings, pervading all to observe and descend,\ntransforming and delivering the multitudes of living things.\nSevering the roots of evil, forever eradicating the wicked roots of humans and all beings.\nInscribed in the Mystic Capital, on the Cinnabar Terrace of the Mystic Capital, recording merits and virtuous names.\nThe assembled perfected ones arrayed in ranks, attending in ordered rows.\nAll heed the words of the Jade Emperor—these are the words of the Jade Emperor.\nThis scripture is the Jade Emperor’s decree.\nProtecting those who recite and uphold it, safeguarding those who recite and maintain the scriptural dharma.\nAttaining the shore of the Dao, ascending to the shore of the Dao.\nPreventing all calamities from encroaching, ensuring no disasters assail.\nI bear the Emperor’s mandate, carrying out the Jade Emperor’s command.\nAll heed in reverence—all humans, beings, ghosts, and spirits obey.\nHerein lies the merit of the entire scripture.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Protection and Upholding**\n\nAt that time, the August Heavenly Thearch, having spoken these verses, addressed the great assembly, saying: These are the wondrous dharma-words of the Jade Emperor, the secret and arcane utterances of all the sages. The path is severed, the Dao cut off—subtle and profound beyond thought, majestic and vast in scope, the foundation of all divine luminaries. It safeguards and stabilizes the realm, delivering beings from birth and death.\n\nWhen the August Heavenly Thearch had finished speaking these words, the pure assembly of the dharma gathering all gazed upward toward the Dao’s discourse, universally attaining enlightenment.\n\nAt that time, the August Heavenly Thearch bowed in reverence and extolled the Jade Emperor. Having recited the verses, he addressed the assembled host of celestial immortals, perfected beings, divine generals, and all others, saying: These are the wondrous dharma-words of the Jade Emperor.\n\nAll the immortal sages possess their own dharma-words—vast yet measurable, transmitted within limits. Some may know their beginning and end; some benefit the living but neglect the dead; some aid humans but forsake other beings; some are recognized by ghosts and spirits, while others fail to subdue demons and malevolent forces. Some remain formless and unknowing, unable to universally deliver—none are wondrous or sublime.\n\nYet the transformative power of this scripture is infinite, its majesty and benefit immeasurable. All receive its blessings—it is no ordinary teaching. These are the wondrous dharma-words of the Jade Emperor, the secret and arcane utterances of all the perfected sages.\n\nWhen the Primordial Beginning expounded this scripture, how could it be said that all the sages and most perfected ones who heard and received it did not treasure it, daring not to lightly disclose it? Thus it is called the \"secret of all the sages,\" the \"arcane words.\" The path is severed, the Dao cut off—this is the supreme vehicle. The dharma is rarely heard, the essential path of cultivating the real, the circuit of entering sagehood. Illusory desires and false thoughts—here, their roots are plucked. Love, attachments, and mundane thoughts—no longer sprout or spread. The cycles of rebirth and transmigration—severed in one stroke. Thus it is said: the path is severed, the Dao cut off. Another version states: the Seven Sages are all deluded, and this is a path humans find difficult to tread—this is also true.\n\nSubtle and profound beyond thought—deep, mysterious, and wondrous. The divine cannot be grasped by thought, nor entered through contemplation. The human mind’s reflections cannot easily reach it. Majestic and towering, the wondrous model of immortal verses, the true seal of the divine luminaries’ hearts. Another interpretation: the Jade Emperor’s Dao is the model, the ancestral teacher of all divine luminaries. This is too restrictive.\n\nIt safeguards and stabilizes the realm, delivering beings from birth and death.\n\nAt that time, the August Heavenly Thearch, having spoken these wondrous dharma-words up to the phrase \"delivering from birth and death,\"—the dharma gathering, the flower-adorned assembly; the pure assembly, the assembly of pure and sacred beings—all gazed upward toward the Dao’s discourse. Or, some take it as gazing upward toward the wondrous dharma-words of the August Heavenly Thearch. Universally attaining enlightenment, all achieved awakening.\n\n**Verification:**\nThe Master’s words on human nature and the Dao of Heaven cannot be heard. The *Wenshi Jing* states: \"Sages and the wise create delusion; even ghosts and spirits do not comprehend.\" When the Buddha expounded the dharma on Vulture Peak, the bodhisattvas listened with rapt attention. The Jade Emperor’s dharma-words—severed path, cut-off Dao, subtle and profound beyond thought—what doubt can there be? As the foundation of all divine luminaries, stabilizing the realm and delivering beings from birth and death—these are its natural effects.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nThere are no people beyond the Dao in the world, nor is there a Dao beyond people. Humans, beings, the hidden and the manifest—all are the Dao. Human nature is wholly real; all things are complete within it. All transformations and nurturing, the world’s beginning and end—all are the reality of our nature. The Jade Emperor is the embodiment of the Dao; the scripture is the Dao’s intent. Only the Dao achieves complete spiritual transformation, its wondrous essence naturally so. Humans share the same nature—how could they not uphold this scripture? Knowing the Dao resides within, embodying the Dao with a single heart, generation after generation without duality—then the perfected sages are within me.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Protection and Upholding**\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke in verse:\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s merit is vast,\nthe profound principle most abstruse.\nBorn before the kalpas’ expanse,\nits transformations span past and present.\n\nI now expound this wondrous scripture,\ncompassionately mindful of all sentient beings.\nThis is the most sublime dharma,\nthe merit among merits.\n\nIts name is the supreme vehicle,\nincomparable, the first of all.\nThe Great Radiant King of Light,\nwhose majesty and virtue are rare in the world.\n\nIt can shatter violent demons,\nsubduing all their hearts.\nIt can

of ancestors ascend.\nThe household shines with glory,\nextending to father and mother.\nAuspiciousness ever flourishes,\nand calamities cannot intrude.\n\nTherefore, I now proclaim—\nlet all listen attentively.\nWith compassion, I ferry all beings,\nthat they may reach the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe sound of the ordinary concludes.\nThus, the Dharma assembly awakens the pure multitude,\nand the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Origin spoke in verse:\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s virtue is vast,\nhis profound principles exceedingly deep.\nBorn before the great kalpas,\nhe transforms through past and present.\n\nI, the Primordial Origin, now expound this wondrous scripture,\nmoved by compassion for all sentient beings.\nAmong all meritorious deeds, this is the supreme merit,\nan unparalleled wondrous Dharma,\nthe foremost mystery.\n\nThe Venerable King of Great Luminosity,\nboundless in radiance,\nthe Awakened King, most exalted.\nHis awe-inspiring virtue is rare in the world,\nhis

struck by lightning, plague, bandits, and imprisonment;\nthird, the Five Acts of Betrayal against parents.\nMencius spoke of the Five Unfilial Acts:\nlaziness of the four limbs, gambling and drinking,\ncoveting wealth, favoring wife and children,\nfollowing the desires of the ears and eyes,\nbringing disgrace to parents,\npursuing bravery and violence,\nendangering parents.\nFourth, irreverence, lack of faith, disobedience, and disregard for ritual—these are the Five Transgressions.\nWith a single invocation of the Emperor’s name,\nsins vanish with the sound.\n\nThe Five Decays:\nthe pearl crown shatters, the body bends,\nthe head bows, the eyes weep,\nthe nose drips, the body loses its light,\nheavenly robes fray, the shadow is exposed,\nand the spirit’s movement is no longer free.\nThese are the encounters of fate’s cycles.\n*Ke-jia*: the meeting of past karmic conditions.\n*Xun*: swift as thunder.\n*Hao*: hail, the icy rain.\n*Si*: lurking in darkness to exploit human weakness.\nThose who harm themselves through irrational desires—\nannihilation and cessation, yet no misfortune befalls.\nThe lords of the Thirty-Two Heavens of the four directions—east, west, south, and north.\nThe words of the scripture’s upholder are profound and wondrous, rare to hear,\nand wherever they go, people revere them wholeheartedly.\nThe Seven Ancestors: father, grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather,\nthe ancestor of the lineage branch, the ancestor who founded the grove, and the ancestor who established the surname.\n*Chi-sheng*: great brilliance and glory.\nWith compassion, I ferry all beings,\nthat they may reach the Supreme Clarity, the Great Luo Realm.\n\nThis verse by the Primordial Origin extols the merits of the Jade Emperor’s Jade Scripture,\nurging all to revere and uphold it.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Protection and Upholding**\n\nThen, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies:\nAll who uphold and recite this

and humans.\nSimply devote the heart with reverence,\nand the household and nation will know peace,\nlife will be preserved, disasters averted,\nand inauspiciousness swept away.\nShould emperors,

fate’s cycles turn, the true Dao shall prevail.\nThose who attain it are revered by celestial immortals.\nTreasure it, keep it secret.\n\nThen, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies:\nAll in the world who uphold and recite this scripture,\nwho receive and chant the precious name of the Jade Emperor,\npossess deep roots in the Dao—what the Confucians call \"clear and abundant endowment,\"\nwhat the Buddhists call \"excellent karmic capacity.\"\nThey bear heavy affinities from past lives,\nhaving broadly cultivated hidden virtue in former kalpas,\nand thus possess good predestined connections.\nFor the supreme Dao is rarely heard,\nDharma assemblies are rarely encountered,\nand auspicious kalpas are rarely met.\nSome pass through lifetimes without hearing the true Dharma;\nothers hear but do not believe or awaken,\nfailing to fully comprehend or receive its true benefits.\nAll this stems from shallow karmic capacity and thin predestined affinity.\nNow, having encountered this Dharma assembly,\nhearing the true Dharma and receiving its true benefits,\nthey have cultivated through kalpas,\npossessing deep roots in the Dao and heavy affinities from past lives.\nThis scripture is exalted and wondrous,\nuniversally ferrying gods and humans.\nSimply devote the heart to its reverent veneration,\nand with utmost sincerity and respect,\nupholding this scripture,\nthe household and nation will know peace,\nlife will be preserved, disasters averted,\nlife prolonged, and calamities dispelled.\nSince ancient times, sages and worthies have been born and have died,\ndisasters and misfortunes ever present—\nhow then can one speak of preserving life and averting disaster?\nIt means preserving the Mandate of Heaven and maintaining the upright qi,\nremaining composed amid long-standing trials,\nliving in accord and dying in peace,\nunmoved by fortune or misfortune—\nsuch is the preservation of life and averting of disaster through upholding the scripture.\nSweeping away inauspiciousness,\nwhere the scripture’s Dharma abides,\nmisfortunes silently vanish;\nthe virtuous receive celestial aid,\ndisasters are forever dispelled,\nand nothing inauspicious remains.\nEmperors, kings, and nobles—\nthe ruler of all under heaven is called the Son of Heaven, the August, the Emperor;\nin the Zhou, he was called the King.\nIn recent times, those enfeoffed as lords of a state are called kings,\nwhile those granted hereditary office are called nobles.\nIn ancient times, nobles were enfeoffed with a hundred *li*.\nThose who receive and uphold this scripture\nwill bring their nations to enjoy great peace,\nand hostile foes will be subdued.\n\"Subdued\" means pacified.\nWhen a state is well-governed,\ninternally ordered and externally majestic,\nevildoers and bandits do not arise,\nnaturally subdued and pacified.\nThe four barbarians come to submit,\nall under heaven is at peace,\nand borderlands do not wage war.\nThe multitudes of the people\nsing and rejoice in the peace.\nAll under heaven prospers,\nabundant and secure.\nAs fate’s cycles turn,\nthe era of the True Origin unfolds,\nthe reckoning of time completes a full cycle,\nand the true Dao shall prevail in the world.\nThose who attain the scripture’s Dharma\nand the wondrously transformative Dao\nare revered by celestial immortals.\nTreasure it, keep it secret.\nThis scripture is exalted and sacred—\ntreasuring it is fitting.\nYet if it universally ferries gods and humans,\nwhy speak of keeping it secret?\nWould this not privatize the Heavenly Dao?\nThough the great Dao universally saves,\nit must not be lightly transmitted to the faithless.\nThe Buddha’s Treasury of the True Dharma Eye\nis not indiscriminately shown to others.\nConfucius said:\n\"Those below the middle cannot be spoken to of higher things.\"\nTrue understanding must arise from inner awakening.\nTo treat it lightly is to profane the Heavenly.\nThe scripture says to keep it secret—\nreaders, take heed and comprehend its meaning.\n\n---\n\n**Fifth Chapter: Responses and Verifications**\n**Eleven Additional Verses on Verifications**\n\nAt that time, the Perceiver

destinies\nare truly pitiable.\nThe four Perfected beseech the Heavenly Worthy\nto expound the sufferings of their karmic retribution in the evil destinies—\nso earnest is their compassionate desire to deliver the world.\n\nBoth teachings speak of karmic retribution,\nthough Confucians deem it otherwise.\n*Tai Jia* says:\n\"Heaven’s calamities may yet be avoided;\nself-inflicted calamities cannot be lived through.\"\nThe *Commentary* states:\n\"Virtue brings blessing, excess brings misfortune.\"\nIt also says:\n\"The response between heaven and humans\nis swifter than an echo.\"\nHow could they not speak of karmic retribution?\nThe Master said:\n\"The noble person is mindful of punishment.\"\nHe also said:\n\"Revere the Mandate of Heaven.\"\nThus, one naturally refrains from evil.\nDelighting in the Dao and virtue,\none is free from other destinies.\nThrough the ages, in village drinking ceremonies and archery rites,\nlaws and ordinances were read aloud,\ninstructing the multitudes—\nonly to correct their conduct, not their hearts,\nand guide them toward goodness.\n\nThe two teachings speak of karmic retribution and penal suffering for no other purpose than to extricate beings from their karmic destinies and guide them toward supreme goodness. Alas! Only the sage, through the numinous Way of education, brings the multitudes to submission. The Jade Emperor’s virtue and power are supreme, and thus the scriptures clearly reveal karmic retribution to deliver beings from evil destinies—not to deceive the masses. If one does not cultivate the truth but merely dazzles others with talk of fortune and misfortune, this is deceit.\n\nThose who study the scriptures must sever desire to attain the real, escape the personal hell of evil, and only then may they save the world and deliver others.\n\n**Chapter on Verification of Responses, Continued (Chapter Twelve)**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Four Perfected Ones, saying: \"Among all the beings of the world—those who are stubborn, violent, and evil, the unvirtuous—who spend their days and nights before the images of the Dao, yet harbor no reverence in their hearts and utter slanderous words, such sins condemn them to the Five Uninterrupted Hells. If, however, they encounter one who upholds this scripture and employ various expedient means to guide and instruct them, such persons may extinguish their evil minds, believe in and turn toward this scripture, and their karmic offenses will be entirely purified without remainder.\"\n\nAt that time, the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning addressed the Four Perfected Ones—Compassionate Deliverance from Suffering and the others—saying: \"Among all the beings of the world—those who are stubborn, violent, and fierce, whose nature is bold and conduct coarse, the unvirtuous, whose words and deeds are wicked—who spend their days and nights (here, *jing* means ‘end,’ ‘exhaust’; they exhaust day and exhaust night) before the images of the Dao and the sacred likenesses of the gods, yet harbor no reverence in their hearts and utter slanderous words (*fei*: to criticize with words; *bang*: to defame with words), thus showing disrespect to the images of the Dao and slandering the sacred—such sins condemn them to the Five Uninterrupted Hells, the great hells of the netherworld. Without the methods of the sage, they inevitably fall into this retribution. Observe the laws of the world that punish those who slander heretical teachings, and you will understand the gravity of slandering the gods.\n\n\"If they encounter one who upholds this scripture (here, *zhi yu* means that at that time, they happen to meet), who employs various expedient methods of salvation to guide and instruct them—those who slander the gods and revile the Dharma, whose karmic roots are deep and heavy, who are obstinately deluded and lack faith—the upholder of the scripture, with great compassion and expedient means, awakens, guides, and transforms them, revealing their innate goodness and arousing their virtuous thoughts. Thus, those who slander the gods and revile the Dharma may extinguish all their evil minds, believe in and turn toward this scripture, take refuge with sincere faith, and devote themselves to it. Their karmic offenses (here, *bi* refers to those who slander the gods and revile the Dharma) will be entirely purified without remainder. As their karma dissolves and their sins vanish, all retribution is exhausted, and they are forever freed from transgression, never to return. Constantly pure and clean, their evil retribution is permanently removed, and no unresolved karma remains. Even in the Uninterrupted Hell, where karma is difficult to dissolve, if one wholeheartedly believes in and turns toward the true scripture, evil roots are severed at once, all defilements are extinguished, and what fetters remain? With roots and defilements instantly eradicated, karma is purified without remainder.\n\nThe virtue of the gods and the merit of the scriptures bring the greatest benefit. Both teachings emphatically speak of sin and blessing, earnestly revealing the gravity of the sin of disrespecting the gods and slandering the Dharma. Confucians likewise warn against flattery and irreverence toward the spirits—how could Confucians fail to revere the gods or honor the scriptures? The *Book of Songs* says: *\"Do not disgrace those who gave you life.\"* Master Zhang said: *\"To feel no shame in the solitude of one’s chamber is to not disgrace one’s origins.\"* He also said: *\"To preserve the mind and nurture one’s nature is to be unwavering.\"* Both teachings speak of revering the gods and honoring the scriptures to cultivate the mind and practice the Dao, feeling no shame before heaven, earth, and the gods, believing in the words of the Dharma, and embodying the Dao to attain the real.\n\nConfucians speak of not flattering the gods to caution against seeking blessings through irreverence. Serving Heaven, revering Heaven, aspiring to Heaven, honoring the words of the former kings, responding with reverent haste—Confucianism and the two teachings are one in this. If sacrifices bring no benefit and reverence is not practiced, if the Mandate of Heaven is not feared, these are corrupt words. Confucians also sternly reprove such views—how could this apply only to the two teachings?\n\nAlas! Good and evil, reverence and negligence—all arise from the mind. If one severs desire, relinquishes cunning knowledge, empties the five aggregates, and removes the five burdens, then one is no longer bound by the five phases. Heaven and earth cannot restrain them, so how could the Five Uninterrupted Hells ensnare them? The Buddha said: *\"By reciting the Buddha’s name, fire pits transform into lotus ponds.\"* Mencius said: *\"Recite the words of Yao and practice the deeds of Yao, and you are Yao.\"* Thus, the true efficacy of goodness is immediately manifest.\n\n*Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture, Volume Eight* concludes.\n*Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture, Volume Nine* begins.\n\n**Chapter on Verification, Continuation of Chapter Thirteen**\n\nMoreover, if there are wicked and foolish men of perverse views and obstinate delusion who, upon seeing one upholding this scripture, give rise to all manner of evil and rebellion—casting sidelong, crooked glances, or even harboring a single malicious thought, uttering a single wicked word, and recklessly slandering those who uphold the scripture—their transgression is profoundly grave. After the end of their lives, they shall fall into the great hells, with no hope of escape.\n\nNot only is the sin of disrespecting the gods and slandering the scripture severe. Again, if there are foolish and benighted men of perverse views and obstinate delusion who, upon beholding those who recite and uphold this scripture—*beholding* meaning to see with their own eyes—give rise to all manner of evil and rebellion, lacking faith in their hearts, failing to recognize that the scripture contains the words of the Dao and the teachings of the Dharma, and that upholding it brings benefit, they grow arrogant and dismissive, despising and slandering it. They give rise to all manner of transgressions and rebellious acts, casting sidelong, crooked glances, unwilling to see the scripture or those who uphold it. They lack the proper gaze of settled observation, instead casting biased, perverse glances, treating them with contempt, aversion, and disdain. Even if they harbor a single malicious thought or utter a single wicked word, recklessly slandering those who uphold the scripture—*slander* meaning to praise or defame—their offense is grave. Upholding the scripture is a virtuous act and must not be defamed. Yet these wicked and obstinate men, ignorant of karmic causes, sins, and blessings, unaware of the goodness of upholding the scripture, recklessly generate slanderous, abusive, and reviling speech against those who uphold it. Their transgression is profoundly grave. After the end of their lives—*end* meaning their allotted span is exhausted.\n\nThey fall into the great hells, the Avīci Hell, with no end to their confinement. *Permanent* means final, eternal. Those who recklessly slander the true Dharma plant deep karmic roots, and thus their fall into hell makes escape nearly impossible.\n\nAll perception is one. If perception is not upright, it becomes perverse. All people are one; if they cling to delusion and fail to awaken, they become foolish and wicked. The heart is one; if it generates evil thoughts, it becomes rebellious. The eyes are one; if they cast biased, perverse glances, they become transgressive. A single thought, however minute, is one; if it gives rise to an evil intention, it becomes the root of karma. A single word, however slight, is one; if it utters an evil speech, it becomes the source of sin.\n\nThe noble person perfects the beauty of unity, commending others’ goodness. Those who uphold the scripture should be praised; to recklessly generate slander is to create one’s own suffering. Human life is originally free of karma, yet one invites grave sin upon oneself—how deeply lamentable.\n\nThe end of life is the return of the borrowed vessel of creation, naturally unbound. Yet for one who slanders the Dharma, even death brings no peace. How endless is their suffering, with no hope of escape.\n\nThe heart of Heaven is benevolent; the Supreme Deity cherishes life. The spirits are upright and do not abandon people. Yet if the sinner has no end to their confinement, is it Heaven that restrains them? No—calamity is self-made, and fixed karma is inescapable.\n\nTo dissolve one’s own karma, one must return to self-faith. Unwavering devotion to supreme goodness severs the root of karma. Alas! Heaven’s punishment is impartial; the law has no favorites. A compassionate father cannot shield his son, nor can a filial son protect his father. The spirits are perfectly just—how could they absolve self-inflicted karma?\n\nThose who believe in the scripture and turn toward the Dharma may repent of past transgressions, just as a worldly person who confesses sincerely may be spared punishment. In this world, the sagely and the foolish are not inherently different. If one cannot speak with eloquence, let their voice at least follow the rhythm of the law; if one cannot avoid uttering false words, let them at least refrain from evil speech. If one cannot act without fault, let their body at least serve as a vessel for liberation; if one cannot avoid wrongdoing, let them at least refrain from creating bodily karma. If one cannot guard against delusive thoughts, let them at least preserve their utmost sincerity; if one cannot avoid evil intentions, let them at least refrain from creating mental karma.\n\nIf one does not understand the great Dao, let them not slander it. If one cannot comprehend the scripture, let them not reject it. If one cannot recite or uphold it, let them not slander others. If one does not understand spirits, life and death, or cause and effect, let them not utter defamatory words. With a heart of upright faith, clarity in the Dao will naturally arise over time, gradually attaining sagehood and transcendence—what karma or sin could then remain?\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Verification of Retribution Continued**\n\nAs for men and women in the world who encounter this scripture yet fail to revere it, handling it with filthy hands, reciting it with impure mouths, or placing it upon unclean beds and couches—those who, while reciting or expounding it, engage in vulgar speech and frivolous laughter, treating it as an ordinary text—such people, after their lives end, will fall into the Avīci Hell with no hope of escape. Their misfortune will extend to nine generations of ancestors, who will suffer interrogation in Fengdu. Their sins will burden their descendants, afflicting future generations.\n\nIn hell, they will endure immeasurable kalpas of immense suffering. Even if they encounter the sacred teachings and receive repeated salvation, their sins will only slightly diminish. If they further receive the extraordinary mercy of the highest sages, they may escape hell, only to be reborn among the hungry ghosts. For thousands of myriads of kalpas, they will not even hear the name of water or broth. Once their ghostly retribution is exhausted, they will be reborn as animals. After their animal retribution is complete, if they are reborn as humans, they will again appear in remote barbarian lands, as women, in poverty and hardship, afflicted with chronic illnesses and disabilities, enduring boundless suffering. They will be despised and rejected by all, unable to live in peace or die in ease. Such is the gravity of the sin incurred by treating this scripture lightly.\n\nThis is the retribution for disrespecting the scripture. *Failing to revere* means lacking respect and admiration. *Handling with filthy hands* refers to touching or flipping through the scripture with unclean hands, thereby defiling it. *Reciting with an impure mouth* means chanting or upholding it after consuming the five pungent vegetables, the five spices, or the three tabooed meats. *Placing it upon unclean beds or couches* means setting the scripture on dirty tables, seats, or platforms. *Engaging in vulgar speech and frivolous laughter* means discussing it in common language and treating it as a trivial text.\n\nSuch people not only bring sin upon themselves but also extend calamity to nine generations of ancestors—the four paternal uncles, the four maternal uncles, and the first ancestor. *Suffering interrogation in Fengdu* refers to the examination of transgressions, or the torture of interrogation. This reflects the principle that when a minor ghost commits a crime, the household head is held accountable. *Burdening descendants* means that the sins of an unvirtuous family linger, bringing endless suffering and affliction.\n\nIf they encounter the sacred teachings and receive repeated salvation, their sins may slightly diminish—this is the merit of the scripture and the Dharma. If they receive the extraordinary mercy of the highest sages, it is the pardon of the Supreme Deity, allowing them to escape the suffering of hell. Yet as hungry ghosts, they will endure thousands of myriads of kalpas without even hearing the name of water or broth. Hungry ghosts have vast bellies and narrow throats, making it impossible to consume food or drink. In the dark hells of Fengdu, they neither see nor hear of water or broth.\n\nThere is no creature more foolish than animals. Once their ghostly retribution is exhausted, they are reborn among them, their karma still unresolved. Though human existence is one, rebirth in the Central Kingdom is rare, and obtaining a male body is difficult. They will be born in remote barbarian lands, as women—among the least favored of human forms—enduring poverty, cold, hunger, and hardship, afflicted with chronic illnesses and disabilities, suffering boundless torment. They will be despised and rejected, unable to live in peace or die in ease—all due to their disrespect for this scripture. The gravity of their sin is truly lamentable.\n\nHuman life is one of the Three Powers, alongside Heaven and Earth. This body is precious, entrusted to us to continue our lineage, honor our ancestors, and benefit descendants. The Dao depends on it for transmission—its significance is not trivial. To slight the scripture and the Dharma brings calamity upon oneself, extends misfortune to ancestors, and burdens descendants with karmic retribution. How profoundly foolish is such a person?\n\nMoreover, examining the texts of the Three Teachings, they declare that in the nature of the Dharma, there is no distinction between male and female—everywhere and in every place is a land of bliss. As the *Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"In wealth or poverty, in high station or low, among barbarians or in times of peril, act according to one’s lot and find contentment in all circumstances.\" Yet why is it said that those in foreign lands as women, or those afflicted with illness and hardship, are despised and rejected by others?\n\nThe absence of distinction, where all find contentment, is the Dao. The differentiation of ranks and the discourse on sin and blessing are the workings of karmic retribution. When retribution is made clear, people are thus moved to goodness. Alas! All humans are one—all may become good people. Strive diligently to advance in the Dao, refrain from creating karma, and avoid being despised by others.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Verification of Retribution**\n\nThere are also those who, though they initially believe and accept the teachings, later grow negligent and disdainful. The Youths of Good and Evil report to the Three Officials, inscribing their names in the Black Register and deducting their allotted years from the Azure Record. After death, they are confined in dark prisons, cycling through the Three Paths of suffering without hope of liberation. In this very life, they may endure all manner of illnesses—scabies, leprosy, ulcers, and abscesses—as karmic retribution, tormented day and night by sorrow, grief, and affliction. Or they may suffer violent harm, be shackled in prison, or meet unnatural deaths, poisoned and maimed. They may be devoured by tigers, wolves, or venomous serpents, or ensnared by karmic debts. While traversing mountains and forests, they may encounter brigands who slaughter them or cast them from cliffs. They may be harmed by malevolent spirits or specters, consumed by fire or swept away by floods, or slain indiscriminately by blades and weapons. For slighting this scripture, they forfeit their natural lifespan, reaping such consequences and such retribution—how can this not be lamentable? How can it not be agonizing?\n\nThe benefits of this scriptural Dharma are not such that only the utterly faithless incur sin. There are also those who, though they initially believe without doubt, later grow indolent and disrespectful. The Youths of Good and Evil—those who record the good and evil deeds of the world—report to the Three Officials, inscribing their names in the Black Register (the ledger of transgressions) for the sin of disdaining the scripture. Their allotted years are deducted from the Azure Record (the scroll of merits). After death, they are bound and imprisoned in dark dungeons, shackled in the courts of hell. They wander endlessly through the Three Paths of suffering, with no means of escape.\n\nIn this present life, some endure all manner of illnesses—scabies, leprosy, abscesses, ulcers, and other grievous afflictions—as karmic retribution, repaying their evil deeds. Sorrow, grief, and torment consume them day and night, their suffering unrelenting. Others suffer violent misfortunes or are struck by calamity. Some are imprisoned in fetters, or meet untimely deaths by their own hands. Some are harmed by poison, or devoured and mauled by tigers, wolves, or venomous serpents. Some are seized by creditors and subjected to harm. Some, while traveling through mountains and forests, encounter brigands who murder them, dismember them, or cast them from cliffs, wounding their bodies and ending their lives. Some are secretly harmed by malevolent spirits and spectral beings. Some perish in fires or are swept away by floods. Some are slain by the sword in war. For the sin of disdaining this scripture, they suffer untimely deaths, cut short in their prime, denied a peaceful end. Such are the karmic consequences, such is the retribution—how can this not be lamentable? How can it not be agonizing?\n\nGrieving their suffering, we also mourn their folly—this is the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nIf even a single act of disdain for this scripture incurs boundless retribution, then revering the Dao and believing in the scripture must be a matter of constancy. Through long cultivation, the transformative power of the Dao is perfected, and the efficacy of the scripture is fully realized, bestowing its virtue and manifesting its effects. Yet people, lacking steadfastness, begin with diligence but end in indolence—no wonder sin and karma befall them.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, those of inferior capacity abound—many neither uphold nor even hear the scripture, yet suffer misfortunes and calamities. Are they all guilty of disdaining the scripture? The scripture speaks of the Dao; to disbelieve in the Dao is to lack virtue, which is itself the sin of disdaining the scripture. Without virtue, there is sin—this is the sin of disdaining the scripture. To revere the scripture and dissolve sin, one must advance in the Dao and cultivate virtue.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen of the \"Manifestations of Efficacy\" Continued:**\nYou should diligently and earnestly follow and practice this without fail, refraining from all perverse thoughts. If all thoughts cease to arise, the myriad conditions instantly subside, and the dust-like evil karma dissolves with the heart. All disasters and demonic influences naturally vanish. The merit of this scripture is inconceivable—it is truly the unparalleled, supreme, and wondrous Dharma, the king of all scriptures, of immense benefit, not to be shown to the unworthy.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said to the Perfected Ones: Such is the retribution for the sin of disdaining the scripture. You should diligently and earnestly follow and practice this scriptural Dharma without fail, refraining from all perverse thoughts. If all杂念 cease to arise—no good thoughts, no evil thoughts, no thought of no-thought, no thought of no-no-thought—the myriad conditions instantly subside. The five aggregates are emptied, the nine consciousnesses dissolved, the four images transcended, the hundred errors severed, the ten thousand existences voided, and the mind extinguished into utter nothingness. External conditions, internal conditions, karmic conditions, blessed conditions, and the wondrous condition of emptiness—along with attachments to past lives, the present, and future rebirths—are all cut off, their roots and dust fully exhausted. The dust-like evil karma, as countless as the sands of the Ganges, dissolves with the believing heart. All disasters and demonic influences naturally perish. Such is the inconceivable merit of this scripture—truly the unparalleled, supreme, and wondrous Dharma, without equal among the Three Teachings or the ten thousand methods. It is the king of all scriptures, surpassing even the Confucian classics. It is the sovereign of all scriptures across the Three Teachings, of immense benefit, not to be shown to the unworthy. Though the Dao may be learned by all, it must not be transmitted to those who lack faith and reverence—it is not to be shown to the unworthy, nor imparted to those who do not honor the Dao.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nConfucians do not instruct those who abandon themselves to despair. Buddhas do not save those without affinity. The Daoist Dharma is most exalted—how could it be forced upon the faithless? Alas, faith is the foundation of advancing in the Dao, and true resolve is the essence of attaining sagehood. Without faith, the scripture cannot be transmitted. One must be utterly sincere and resolute, for this is the root of receiving the scripture and entering sagehood.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen of the \"Manifestations of Efficacy\" Continued:**\nIf the gods and humans of the heavens, afflicted by the five decays and four signs, pressed by the cycle of rebirth, can abandon delusive thoughts and uphold this scripture, they will naturally attain celestial blessings, their heavenly fortune secured. They will transcend the Three Realms and abide with the Dao forever. This scripture is most exalted—it must not be recklessly shown to others.\n\nAmong the gods and humans, the six heavens of the Desire Realm still indulge in sensual pleasures. The eighteen heavens of the Form Realm abide in form. The four heavens of the Formless Realm delight in the emptiness of meditative absorption. The four Great Brahma heavens know emptiness and nothingness, though they lack desire for pleasure, their tranquil blessings are still finite. Beyond these heavens, the four highest heavens of the Seed People are free from the cycles of formation and dissolution. The heavens below them, though differing in rank, are subject to formation and dissolution.\n\n**The Five Decays and Four Signs:**\nThe five decays have been explained earlier. The four signs refer to the decline of the marks of non-self, non-person, non-sentient being, and non-lifespan, or the decline of blessed marks and virtuous marks, divided into four phases. Another interpretation holds that the four signs are birth, prime, aging, and death. Yet another defines them as loss of dignity, loss of supernatural powers, loss of joy, and loss of vitality.\n\n**The Cycle of Rebirth Pressing Upon Them:**\nThe thirty-two heavens of the Desire, Form, Brahma, and Formless Realms vary in duration. When the blessings of their heavenly beings are exhausted, they are reborn among humans, each according to their allotted span—hence the cycle of rebirth.\n\n**Abandoning Delusive Thoughts:**\nDelusive thoughts arise from following conditions—whether thoughts of blessings, wisdom, longevity, emptiness, absorption, ascent, or descent. The mind’s endless fabrications, beyond enumeration, are all called delusive thoughts. To abandon them is to cast aside all杂念, leaving no single condition to arise, attaining utter emptiness—this is the relinquishing of illusory thoughts. By abandoning delusive thoughts, one naturally attains celestial blessings, their heavenly fortune further secured, without need for striving.\n\nThe realms of Desire, Form, Formless, and Brahma are each their own dwelling, yet from them one may attain liberation—forever free from the cycle of rebirth, immune to decay and dissolution, achieving great steadfastness beyond the wheel of existence. The body transcends the Three Realms. By rising above the Desire Realm, one ascends through the Form Realm, the Formless Realm, and the Brahma Realm, surpassing the worlds of heaven, earth, and humanity, emerging from the three conditioned states to soar into the highest, mysterious celestial bounds. Abiding with the Dao in perpetuity, merging with the true Dao, enduring through infinite kalpas.\n\nThe effects of the *Treasure Sutra of Heavenly Beings* may thus be known to the world. Take heed.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Verification of Efficacy**\nThis scripture is unmatched, unsurpassed—possessing great majesty and power, a divine incantation of profound efficacy. It can cause all withered stalks to sprout branches and leaves, to blossom with flowers and bear fruit in lush abundance. It dispels the most grievous suffering of sentient beings and grants longevity to those of short lifespan. The merits of this scripture are inconceivable, its praises beyond exhaustion.\n\nThose who disbelieve in this scripture incur karmic consequences as described; those who trust in it, whether heavenly beings or humans, witness its effects as proclaimed. This scripture stands without equal—all other sutras and dharmas fall beneath it, unrivaled in kind, unmatched in excellence. No other teaching can compare; none surpass its benefits.\n\nIt is of great majesty and power, for it both dispels evil and upholds the true. A teaching that cannot encompass both is not called majestic. This scripture eradicates evil and dissolves transgressions, supports the upright and perfects the real—such divine and wondrous virtue, its grace and might immeasurable, is thus called majesty and power.\n\nA divine incantation of the highest order, as explained before: it can cause all withered stalks to sprout branches and leaves, to flourish with flowers and fruit. All grasses, trees, rare blossoms, exotic herbs, auspicious fungi, and sacred fragrances—any living thing that fails to thrive, any that withers or decays—this scripture restores to life, reviving branches, leaves, blossoms, and fruit in luxuriant abundance.\n\nIt dispels the most grievous suffering of sentient beings. This scripture dissolves karmic obstructions, benefiting life; it uproots transgressions, aiding in death. It averts demonic calamities, safeguarding joy. Through eons of enmity and desire, lifelong afflictions, the heaviest of sorrows, and burdens accumulated over lifetimes—this scripture severs their very roots.\n\nIt grants longevity to those of short lifespan. Among mortals, seventy years is rare. This scripture preserves life and extends years, allowing those who perish young or are fated for brief lives to add to their allotted span and attain longevity. Some may ask: Yan Hui, a near-sage, died at thirty—did his virtue not benefit him? How then can this scripture extend life? For one who dies yet does not perish is truly long-lived. Having attained the Dao in clarity, Yan Hui did not die. The scripture’s power to prolong short lives enables beings to perceive the Dao and thus transcend death without perishing.\n\nThe merits of this scripture are inconceivable, its praises beyond exhaustion.\n\nAlas! Minister Kou’s loyalty and righteousness turned withered bamboo into a forest; the Tian clan’s filial piety and fraternal love revived withered thorns. When sages reign above, every household merits enfeoffment, and death and life become joyous. In the fullness of the Great Dao, no virtue or power remains unattained.\n\nThose who contemplate this scripture, take heed—supreme merit and power await. **Verifications, Chapter Nineteen**\n\nWithout having planted the roots of the Dao in past lives or widely sown the fields of blessings, one may not even hear the scripture’s name, let alone behold its text. The merits of this scripture are indeed inexhaustible.\n\nIf one has not planted the roots of the Dao—*roots* being the foundation—then, as the noble person attends to the root, once the root is established, the Dao arises. Hence, it is called the *root of the Dao*. (One version mistakenly writes *seed of the Dao*.) *Su* means \"long-standing\" or \"preparatory\"; *zhi* means \"to establish,\" \"to plant,\" or \"to sow.\" The *root of the Dao* refers to the gradual progression of cultivation, the foundation for entering the Dao. The *Daoist Scriptures* state: \"The Great Dao has no name.\" Through refined cultivation, it is perfected. Confucius said: \"Study the lower to reach the higher.\" The Buddhist scriptures say: \"Through hearing, reflection, and cultivation, one enters samādhi.\" All three teachings esteem learning as the foundation for attaining the Dao.\n\nYet though the Dao may be suddenly realized, it must be gradually cultivated—truly, it cannot be mastered in a single step. Without prior practice in past or present lives, without first planting the roots of the Dao and widely sowing the fields of blessings—*fields of blessings* being where merit accumulates with effect, like sowing a field—then:\n\n**External deeds** include repairing palaces, temples, hermitages, ancestral halls, shrines, pagodas, pavilions, communal halls, bridges, roads; administering medicine and treating illness; aiding the state and saving people; issuing talismans and performing rituals; praying for offspring; benefiting beings; dispelling evil; averting calamity; relieving suffering; and rescuing the poor.\n\n**Internal practices** include compassion, joyful giving, forbearance, harmonious radiance, universal and impartial generosity, and steadfast perfection.\n\n**Coarse actions** include donating wealth, clothing, and food.\n\n**Secret practices** include contemplating the Dao and meditating on the True, cutting off desire to nurture spirit, accumulating essence and storing qi.\n\nTo ascend to sagehood and transcend the mundane—such methods are manifold. The boundless fields of blessings must all be widely sown.\n\nThose who cultivate worldly fields may face droughts, floods, or human mismanagement, resulting in poor harvests. But those who cultivate the fields of blessings—whether in small or great measure—shall reap small or great rewards. The hidden virtues are manifold; even if one remains unaware or their enumeration is inexhaustible, their merit is boundless. Should one fail to cultivate these fields of blessings, they may not even hear the name of this scripture. Without virtue or fortune, the scripture’s name remains unheard.\n\nAs the scripture states, the true Dharma is rarely encountered—this is what it means. How much more so to behold this scripture itself? To see this true scripture is to possess the Dao-eye. Without virtue or fortune, its name goes unheard; how then could one hope to see it?\n\nEach person’s capacity differs, as does their reception. Some possess fortune but lack virtue—wealthy and noble yet foolish. Others possess virtue but lack fortune—poor yet sagely. When virtue and fortune flourish together, one attains rank, longevity, and renown. Should one encounter the true Dharma and gain insight into liberation, it is not through mere kalpas of cultivation or boundless merit that such a state is reached.\n\nAt a gathering of a million buddhas, the true Dharma was entrusted to Mahākāśyapa. Among Confucius’ three thousand disciples, the unifying principle was passed to Zeng Shen. In the Daoist tradition, though its followers number in the millions, only Wenshi inherited the heart of the Most High.\n\nLet the reader take heed.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Verification**\n\nThis scripture adheres to the true standards of the Three Caverns. It is transmitted but once in eighty thousand kalpas—a treasure cherished by the perfected sages of the Pure Capital, secreted within the Golden Towers of the Jade Capital. Most wondrous and subtle, it is rarely encountered. Only those with the bone of immortality—destined to become true immortals of the Nine Heavens—may chance upon this text. Having met with this opportunity, they shall later present gold and treasures to their master, swear oaths, and receive it. Only then, when the time is ripe and fate aligns, may it be transmitted. It must not be lightly disclosed; revere it, guard it well. This scripture is not to be casually passed on.\n\nIt adheres to the true standards of the Three Caverns: the Cavern of Truth, the Cavern of Mystery, and the Cavern of Spirit—these three ranks are recorded in the celestial statutes and golden precepts. The \"true standards\" are the natural principles. \"Eighty thousand kalpas\" refers to the cycles of cosmic renewal spanning eighty thousand great kalpas. One tradition holds that human life begins at *yin* and ends at *you*, with eight periods totaling 86,400 years—roughly eighty thousand years. Each cycle of growth, harvest, and renewal is called a kalpa. \"Sand\" signifies innumerable grains. The transmission of this scripture once in eighty thousand kalpas marks the turning of the great Dharma-wheel—an exceedingly rare occurrence. The earlier explanation is nearly correct.\n\nThis is a treasure of the perfected sages of the Pure Capital of Supreme Clarity, secreted within the Golden Towers of the Jade Capital—not the abode of the Jade Emperor, but the repository of the *Tai Xuan Bao Zang Di Jing*. Most wondrous and subtle, its praises extol the difficulty of encountering it. Only those with the bone of immortality—those who have cultivated in past lives and possess the destiny of transcendence—may become true immortals of the Nine Heavens. Having met with this text and this karmic connection, they shall later present gold and treasures to their master, swear oaths, and receive it. This is not merely the offering of worldly gold and treasures, but the pledge of a heart utterly sincere and selfless, unwavering for all kalpas—a vow sworn before heaven and earth, as pure as the midday sun, untarnished by even a speck of dust. Such is true, indestructible gold.\n\nOnly then, when the moment arrives and fate aligns, may it be transmitted. It must not be lightly disclosed. To \"disclose\" is to leak; the scripture’s essence must not be carelessly revealed, nor shared with the unworthy. Revere it, guard it well. Alas! Knowing the weight of this scripture, all should cultivate good karma as the foundation for receiving it. Once received, it must never be treated lightly. Treasure it, strive for it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Verification (continued)**\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy expounded this meaning again and spoke in verse:\n\n*Were the waters of rivers and streams*\n*To bear lotuses in their waves,*\n*Or the feathers of kind crows turn white—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were turtles to grow fur,*\n*Fine enough for robes and garments,*\n*Or the moon at night melt ice—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were the legs of gnats and midges*\n*Strong enough to build bridges,*\n*To bear all manner of weight—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were fledgling sparrows*\n*Able to carry great mountains,*\n*And cast them to distant lands—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were a single leaf of a boat*\n*To bear the weight of Kunlun,*\n*And ferry it across the sea—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were leeches to grow tusks,*\n*As large as an elephant’s,*\n*From their very mouths—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were the leaves of mugwort*\n*To cover boundless realms,*\n*And shade the Kunlun peaks—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were crows and owls*\n*To nest together in one tree,*\n*Feeding and nurturing one another—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were rabbits to grow horns,*\n*Fit for ladders to the heavens,*\n*To climb to the very summit—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were mice to climb*\n*Those rabbit-horn ladders,*\n*And devour the moon in the sky—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were donkeys’ lips*\n*To turn the hue of *pingpo* fruit,*\n*And sing and dance as well—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were flies and insects*\n*To drink barrels of wine,*\n*And grow drunk and lost—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded again the merit of the scripture and spoke in verse:\n\n*Were the waters of rivers and streams*\n*To bear lotuses in their waves...*\n\nThe rivers run deep, their currents vast and waves towering—yet they cannot bear lotuses. The feathers of kind crows are naturally black—yet they cannot turn white. To speak of white crows or lotus-bearing rivers is to describe the impossible, and thus to illustrate the extreme rarity of encountering this scripture.\n\nTurtles are naturally without fur, and the moon is inherently the Great Yin. To speak of gathering turtle fur for clothing or melting ice with the night moon is but to describe the utterly nonexistent—thus illustrating the extreme rarity of encountering this scripture. Moreover, to say that the legs of mosquitoes and midges could construct bridges to bear heavy loads; that fledglings with yellow beaks could carry great mountains and cast them into other realms; that a small boat could ferry Mount Kunlun across the vast sea; or that leeches could grow the tusks of elephants—leeches being but tiny water insects—these too are impossibilities. Or that the leaves of mugwort and reeds could cover boundless worlds and shade Mount Kunlun; that crows and owls, both ill-omened birds, could nest together and feed one another in filial reciprocity; that rabbit horns could serve as ladders to ascend to heaven; that a shrew could climb such a ladder to reach the heavens and devour the moon; that donkeys’ lips could turn the hue of *pingpo* fruit and sing and dance; or that flies and insects could drink barrels of wine and grow drunk and lost—all these are things that must never exist, principles that have never been. Yet they are recounted in detail to show how difficult it is to encounter this scripture.\n\nThe Great Dao is possessed by all, and the true scripture is complete in each. Even the foolish and the dull-witted have their correct nature and may all be transformed and delivered—why then compare the rarity of this scripture to such impossibilities? Could it truly never be transmitted? The answer lies in the hierarchy of teachings: this scripture is the most exalted. Those who transmit it may not embody the truth of the Primordial Beginning, and those who receive it may not grasp the secrets of the Jade Emperor. With obstructions and biases, the full scripture remains obscure. Some may never hear or see it; others may hear or see it in vain, their understanding of its merit and efficacy left vague. Without attaining its full benefit, one must indeed acknowledge its rarity.\n\nYet the difficulty of difficulty need not be feared. With utmost sincerity and reverence, the merit of the scripture will naturally be met.\n\n**Chapter 22: Manifestations of Response (Continued)**\nThen the Heavenly Worthy, having expounded the verse, addressed the four assemblies: Should there be one in the world who upholds this scripture, they are called a *Body of Merit and Virtue*, for all sentient beings are sheltered beneath their shade. They are called a *Body of Spiritual Penetration*, for all auspicious signs gather in their presence. They are called a *Body of Purity*, for no evil karma can assail them.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning, having expounded the verse, addressed the four assemblies. *Pu* means \"all-pervading\"; the *four assemblies* have been explained previously.\n\nShould there be one in the world who upholds this scripture, they are called a *Body of Merit and Virtue*. That which benefits others is *merit*; that which enriches others is *virtue*. To benefit all beings without exception is to embody the wondrous merit and mysterious virtue of the profound Dao. All sentient beings—whether in the realms of the moving or the growing, all that has life, even earth, wood, metal, and stone, so long as they possess essence and spirit—are sheltered beneath their shade. The sages of the Three Teachings universally ferry and eternally benefit all. *Yin* means \"to cover.\" The upholder of the scripture benefits self and others, humans and things, the knowing and the unknowing, bestowing universal grace—all are enveloped in their compassionate shade.\n\nThey are called a *Body of Spiritual Penetration*. Though humans are the most spiritually endowed, they possess no spiritual penetration. The wondrous Dharma within this scripture is supremely profound and divine, unobstructedly transcendent—thus the upholder of this true scripture is called a *Body of Spiritual Penetration*. All auspicious signs gather in their presence. The sages of the Three Teachings are eternally perfected and indestructible. *Xian* means \"all\"; *zhen* means \"to arrive\"; *ji* means \"to assemble.\" The upholder of the scripture, in their own conduct, is harmonious and auspicious; in their dealings with others, they are loving and impartial; in their governance of the world and the state, they are never misplaced. The blessings they attain are manifold, with a thousand auspicious signs converging. Heaven does not withhold the Dao; Earth does not hoard its treasures. People submit to their transformation; things respond to their numinous power—all auspicious signs gather in their presence.\n\nThey are called a *Body of Purity*. That which is unstained is *pure*; that which is unburdened is *clear*. The upholder of the scripture quiets all entanglements, leaving not a single flaw—thus no evil can assail them. *Qin* means \"to encroach and harm.\" Whether self-inflicted karma, heavenly calamities, past transgressions, or present faults; whether the misfortunes of ancestors or the obstructions of the times; whether the afflictions of fate, the clashes of stellar positions, the assaults of demons and ghosts, the slander of people, or the malevolence of things—all such evil karma is transformed from inauspicious to auspicious, unable to encroach or harm. The person of the Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, nurturing all beings. Their blessings and felicity are everlasting, and Heaven’s protection never wanes. The virtuous are aided by Heaven, free from disaster and harm—truly a *Body of Merit, Spiritual Penetration, and Purity*. Those who merely possess a body but lack merit, spiritual penetration, and purity do not truly uphold the scripture. Strive on, and one may verify its efficacy for oneself.\n\n**Chapter 23: Manifestations of Response (Continued)**\nThey are called a *Body of Majestic Virtue*, for neither heavenly demons nor heterodox paths can subdue them. They are called a *Body Without Equal*, for the Supreme Emperor extols them from afar, and all spirits revere them.\n\nThe upholder of this scripture is not only called a *Body of Purity* but also a *Body of Majestic Virtue* (as explained previously). *Heavenly demons and heterodox paths* include the demon kings of the heavens, demonic men and women, dark and shadowy demons, asuras, *gusiluo*, *chi*, *mei*, *wangliang*, spirits, deviants, specters, and malevolent forces—along with the deceptions of worldly people, the heresies of external paths, and all manner of inauspicious, seductive, and aberrant influences. *Cannot subdue*: *She* means \"to summon, tame, and subjugate.\" When demons and heterodox forces invade, people are deluded and submit unknowingly—this is called *she*. For example, in the Buddhist tradition, Ānanda was ensnared by the courtesan Matangi and nearly violated his precepts. Yet the upholder of this scripture, having awakened to the seal of the mind, is selfless and non-attached, silently upholding the true scripture. Their Dharma power is complete, their Dao lofty, and their virtue weighty—majestic and radiant beyond measure. Ghosts and demons lose their courage; spirits and specters vanish without form. How could any evil or demon dare to assail the upright? Thus, *heavenly demons and heterodox paths cannot subdue them*. Ānanda, though upholding the precepts, was moved by a single thought toward Matangi—having not yet awakened to the essence of the mind and lacking the scripture’s guidance, he was ensnared by her.\n\nWere it not for the power of the Buddha’s *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, how could one preserve their entire being? This *August Scripture* is the sovereign among all scriptures, and the majestic virtue of its upholders is ten thousand times greater than that of other scriptures. Those who uphold this scripture are not merely called *majestic-virtue bodies*; they are called *bodies beyond compare*—bodies without equal, without peer, without counterpart. Truly so.\n\nThe upholders of this scripture stand supreme, with none to rival them. As the scriptural commentary states: *\"Nothing compares to the Buddha.\"* The Confucian texts say: *\"The Master’s unattainability is like the heavens—one cannot ascend by steps.\"* The distant chant of the Heavenly Emperors—here, *Heavenly Emperors* does not refer to the Jade Emperor but to the Emperors of all heavens—*distant* meaning far, *chant* signifying the celestial proclamation praising those who advance in the Dao. Some interpret *chant* as *ballad*, implying song, but this is contextually unsound and should not be followed. For when a boy is born in the world, the myriad spirits chant in reverence; when a girl is born, the myriad spirits chant in service. The Heavenly Emperors cherish life, and all heavens rejoice. The person of the Dao, whose sincerity moves heaven and earth and stirs ghosts and spirits, harmonizes their virtue with heaven—thus do the Heavenly Emperors celebrate. Yet these Emperors are most exalted, unlike other spirits; from their celestial palaces, they merely hear the distant celestial tones in joy, not the words of song. Otherwise, why would this text first speak of the *distant chant of the Heavenly Emperors* and then of the *reverence of the myriad spirits*? The *myriad spirits*—not one but many—encompass all spirits, high and low, who all revere the sacred canon. When they encounter a true upholder of the scripture, a person of the Dao, none fail to show respect.\n\nHuman nature is inherently firm, luminous, centered, and harmonious, standing shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning, inherently possessing great majestic virtue beyond compare. Yet if one cannot restrain emotions and desires, evil enters, and the spirits do not revere them. Alas! Zixia was a worthy man, yet upon seeing splendor and beauty, he was delighted—had he not received the true teaching of the Master, how could he have become a lofty disciple? If one can remain single-mindedly true without pretense, they shall forever attain the Dao.\n\n**Verification Chapter, Continuation of the Twenty-Fourth Section**\n\nThose who uphold this scripture are called *indestructible bodies*, for great calamities and dire perils cannot harm them. Those who uphold this scripture are called *Dao-treasury bodies*, for when they speak, ghosts and spirits look up in reverence.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture are not merely called *bodies beyond compare*; they are called *indestructible bodies*. The lives of worldly people are impermanent, their cycles of rebirth unknowable. Some achieve minor merits and minor virtues, their blessings and destinies limited; some cultivate minor roots and minor vehicles, their fruition constrained; some are enlightened yet not fully clear, easily obscured and deceived; some practice yet do not perfect, easily interrupted and severed; some save others and relieve suffering, yet their capacity is quickly exhausted. Their bodies are like duckweed or candle flames, unable to withstand wind and waves—such is not indestructibility. The true upholder of the scripture, whose mind never regresses, is called an *indestructible body*; thus, great calamities and dire perils cannot harm them. Whether in minor, medium, or great kalpas—through cosmic cycles, worldly transformations, the destruction and renewal of the Three Realms, the annihilation of all beings, the collapse of earth and sky, the collision of the four wheels, the mutual conquest of the five phases, the disasters of water, fire, and wind that ravage the world, the dissolution of all phenomena, the exhaustion of all dharmas, the fruitions of all vehicles, the four dhyāna heavens, the three ranks and nine grades, the officials, spirits, generals, and clerks—all are swept into the cycle of rebirth, facing the tribulation of recreation. Yet the true upholder of the scripture attains great indestructibility, transcending kalpas and cycles, never regressing. Whether in the calamities of cosmic cycles, the disasters of past karma, or unforeseen great perils, not even a hair’s breadth can encroach upon them. They remain steadfast through constancy and change, unwavering for aeons—unharmed.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture are not merely called *indestructible bodies*; they are called *Dao-treasury bodies*. *Treasury* means to store, to treasure. The Dao encompasses all, and there is nothing it does not perfect. The *Dao-treasury* contains all without omission, treasuring all without exception. Though the human body is limited, the nature is boundless. Yet if one does not fully realize the Dao, they do not become a *Dao-body*. The true upholder of the scripture, profound as the abyss and vast as the sea, contains within their Dharma-treasury infinite worlds—thus are they called *Dao-treasury bodies*. When they speak, ghosts and spirits look up in reverence. *Answering and expounding* is called *speech*; *self-expression* is called *words*.\n\nPeople have said: if ghosts and spirits do not look up in reverence, it is because words lack sincerity—mere verbal transgressions may yet be forgiven, but how can one move humans and gods, ghosts and spirits?\n\nThe true upholder of the scripture speaks with perfect trustworthiness, their words emerging with order, neither hasty nor concealed, neither failing others nor failing speech. A single word may continue the pulse of a thousand truths; a single word may open the transmission of ten thousand generations; a single word may rescue beings from drowning; a single utterance may shatter the barrier of life and death; a single word may exhaust the Dao of heaven and earth; a single phrase may encompass the mysteries of the ten thousand dharmas; a single word may reveal the conditions of ghosts and spirits; a single utterance may clarify the rise and entanglement of kalpas. A single word may extinguish the tally of sin and merit; a single phrase may unveil the golden elixir.\n\nThe true essence of the Three Teachings lies in a single word of this scripture—cherished by all beings, unknown even to ghosts and spirits. Who would not revere and look up in awe? That ghosts and spirits look up in reverence is thus explained.\n\nThe great sages of the Three Teachings, unwavering through kalpas, are revered in speech by both heaven and humanity—this confirms the principle of the indestructible *Dao-treasury*. How could a mere upholder of the scripture attain such heights? It is because one gain becomes eternal gain, a truth proven in principle. The fault lies only in not truly upholding the scripture.\n\nWhat does *true upholding* entail? A heart of fasting as the foundation, transformed and perfected by spirit.\n\n*Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture, Scroll Nine* concludes.\n*Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture, Scroll Ten* begins.\n\n**Chapter on Verification, Continuation Twenty-Five**\n\nOne who upholds this scripture is called the *Body of Compassion*. The beings of the Six Paths rely upon their goodness.\n\nOne who upholds this scripture is not merely called the *Body of the Dao-treasury*, but the *Body of Compassion*. Great benevolence and boundless grace—this is what is meant by *compassion*. Yet people, divided by the distinction between self and other, their minds set on the fleeting and the lasting, not only fail to universally bestow eternal benefit, thus falling short of compassion; even when they grant favors or deliver others, their aid is limited and impermanent—this, too, is not the *Body of Compassion*. Thus, to distribute wealth to others is called *benevolence*; to teach goodness is called *loyalty*. Petty favors and private kindnesses are not universal salvation.\n\nOne who truly upholds the scripture is no ordinary body—he is the *Great Body of Compassion*, the *Great Body of Mercy*. How is this known? The beings of the Six Paths rely upon his goodness.\n\nThe kinds of the world are exhausted in the Six Paths. The Six Paths contain multitudes, and these multitudes are difficult to fully deliver. The Heavenly Path stands lofty and exalted, its blessings pure and enduring, yet its origins unseen—how can its numbers be counted? Though heaven is high, it still encompasses the Three Realms: desire, form, and formlessness, all subject to arising and decay. Even if their blessings vary in duration, apart from the lords of each heaven, only those who uphold the true Dao endure. As for the myriad heavenly beings and all their kinds, none abide forever; all have beginning and end, and thus are called *sentient beings*.\n\nThe Human Path: humanity is the spirit of the ten thousand things. Though they praise transformation and nurture, propagate the great Dao and its teachings, their stations differ in nobility, their forms in male and female, their numbers teeming like forests, beyond reckoning—these, too, are called *sentient beings*.\n\nThe Asura Path: the demon kings of heaven, demon subjects, demon women, spirits and deviants, monstrosities and portents—these are the demonic kinds of sentient beings.\n\nThe Hell Path: the Five Uninterrupted Hells, the Nine Dark Hells, the Eighteen Great Hells, the Thirty-Six Hells, the Seventy-Two Hells—all their suffering and torment belong to the hellish kinds of sentient beings.\n\nThe Hungry Ghost Path: the gloomy depths of Fengdu, the mighty ghost kings, ghost messengers, those with elongated limbs and massive heads, distended bellies and slender throats, who for ten thousand kalpas never hear the sound of broth or water—these are the hungry ghost kinds of sentient beings.\n\nThe Animal Path: those born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation; creatures of feather, fur, scale, or shell; all their dull and mindless forms—these are the animal kinds of sentient beings.\n\nAll bear the merciful grace of the scripture’s upholder, who lifts them, delivers them, and shelters them. Thus, he secures the blessings of heaven and humanity, resolves the calamities of the human realm, releases those sunk in demonic and hellish realms, and extinguishes the retributions of ghosts and beasts. In one world, ten thousand worlds, or the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds, the beings of the Six Paths, freed from karmic bonds and enriched in blessings, rely upon his goodness. This is called *compassion*.\n\nTo speak of the Six Paths is to encompass all kinds; to speak of sentient beings is to encompass all multitudes. All worlds are thus—from the beginningless past to the endless future, all that is beyond thought and measure relies upon the goodness of one who truly upholds the scripture. Truly, this is *great compassion*!\n\nAlas! First deliver oneself, then deliver others. To save the beings of the Six Paths, one must forever uphold the true scripture, perfecting supreme goodness before it is possible.\n\n**Chapter on Verification, Continuation Twenty-Six**\n\nOne who upholds this scripture is called the *Great Dao Body*, for wherever he goes, he knows no fear.\n\nOne who upholds this scripture is not merely called the *Body of Compassion*, but the *Great Dao Body*. The Dao is originally formless, while the human body has shape. Human nature contains the Dao in its entirety, possessing the principles of heaven and earth and their qi. If one speaks of the *Dao Body*, then all people possess the Dao, yet none fully realize it—thus, the body born of father and mother may simply be called the *human body*. The Four Great Elements disperse, so it may be called the *illusory body*. It remains material and untransformed, so it may be called the *ordinary body*. Living in drunkenness and dreaming, it may be called the *unaware body*. Rushing about from dawn to dusk, content to age and die, it may be called the *karmic body*. Without cultivation or learning, trapped in the cycle of rebirth, it may be called the *sinful body*. Like autumn fragrance, fleeting and brief, it may be called the *sensory body*. Male and female differ in form, old and young in appearance, so it may be called the *impermanent body*. When the great limit arrives, even the six relations cannot be relied upon, so it may be called the *lonely body*. Assailed by wind and rain, heat and cold, it may be called the *suffering body*. Such is the body of one who lacks the Dao.\n\nOne who truly upholds the scripture, attaining the Dharma and becoming perfected, is the *Dao Body*—no ordinary body, but the *Great Dao Body*. Wherever he goes, he knows no fear.\n\n*Fear* is alarm and anxiety; *dread* is terror. Only one who upholds the scripture, called the *Great Dao Body*, moves with ease when going out and carries no burden when returning. Whether coming or going, he is pure, liberated, and at peace—always serene. What worry, what fear? Wherever he is, he knows no fear.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nThe Confucians say: *\"Be cautious in what you do not see, fearful in what you do not hear.\"* Is not caution and fear itself a kind of dread? Moreover, the seven emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, terror, and shock—reside in every person. Yet it is said that wherever one goes, he knows no fear—does this not contradict caution and fear?\n\nIt is not so. Caution and fear restrain human desire to preserve the true Dao. The seven emotions demonstrate the full functioning of human nature, guiding people to subdue their passions and return to their nature. But if the heart of dread arises from inner instability, giving rise to external calamity, and one is seized by terror, this is not the proper way. Thus, the Master said: *\"Look within and find no fault—what worry, what fear?\"* Wherever he goes, he knows no fear, for body and Dao are one, and all he encounters is peace. What fear could there be?\n\nThe Confucians also say: *\"Seeing the great, the heart is at peace.\"* This and the above illuminate each other. For one who upholds the scripture, fearlessness in coming and going is natural—not forced.\n\nForced restraint, like Gaozi’s \"unmoving heart,\" ultimately fails to perceive the Dao. Spontaneity, however—Confucius’s freedom from doubt and following the heart, Mencius’s \"unmoving heart\"—all align with the meaning of this scripture. How excellent are the teachings of both traditions on the study of the heart: *\"Thusness, naturalness, majestic immovability\"*—the way of spiritual transformation is fully contained therein. If one clings through effort, no spontaneous transformation occurs, and the practice cannot endure. Seeking quick results, even without fear, still does not accord with the scripture’s meaning.\n\n**Verification Chapter, Continuation of Chapter 27**\nOne who upholds this scripture is called the \"Good Physician of the Body,\" for they skillfully practice the wondrous Dharma to bring peace and joy to others. One who upholds this scripture is not only called the \"Body of the Great Dao\" but also the \"Good Physician of the Body.\" *Yi* (physician) means \"fitting.\" Medicine fits the illness, removing its obstructions. Worldly physicians examine forms and discern principles, curing people’s ailments and rescuing them from distress. With medicine, they dispel sickness and sustain life, earning names like \"divine,\" \"sagely,\" \"masterful,\" or \"skillful.\"\n\nThe true upholder of this scripture is no worldly physician, nor any ordinary healer, nor one who speaks of elixirs from distant shores. Silently transmitting the golden needle, they are called the \"Good Physician of the Body.\" Skillfully practicing the wondrous Dharma, they address the myriad conditions of human life: countless beings with tangled qi and temperament, qi losing its balance, bearing illnesses from birth, visible ailments, invisible afflictions, personal suffering, familial distress, the troubles of a nation or the world, the woes of an age, or the karmic burdens of countless kalpas. Sorrows and entanglements follow endlessly—beyond the correction of parents, the transformation of sages, or the restraint of royal law; incurable by medicine, unsavable by any remedy.\n\nYet the upholder of this scripture does not resort to the strange or the coercive. With wondrous application, fitting and apt, the good Dharma is neither harsh nor grating, neither contrary to one’s heart nor burdensome to the body. It does not force what is difficult nor indulge through deception. Skillfully practicing the wondrous Dharma to bring peace and joy, with the first application of this wondrous Dharma, the deaf regain hearing; with the second, the blind see clearly; with the third, the mute speak.\n\nWith the fourth application, the lame and chronically ill rise and walk; with the fifth, long-standing ailments and stubborn diseases instantly restore the body; with the sixth, white hair returns to black, and fallen teeth regrow; with the seventh, the old regain vigor, and the young grow stronger; with the eighth, women conceive, and the fetuses of birds and beasts—whether already born or yet unborn—all come to full formation; with the ninth, the earth’s hidden treasures are revealed, and gold and jade emerge into view; with the tenth, withered bones revive, all rising as whole persons.\n\nIt dissolves all disasters and delivers from all calamities. Demonic afflictions and karmic debts never again encroach; nine generations of ancestors and six relations—whether from past kalpas or yet to come—find peace in self and others, and the imprisoned in the unseen realms are freed from bondage. Wealth abounds and the body grows light. Not only does it raise those sunk in chronic illness, but it also transforms and dispels what has not yet taken form. Truly, without medicine there is joy, and life is preserved to extend one’s years—yet this is no mere single remedy or technique to bring ease to one body. The Celestial Physician is most excellent, the compassionate father of all beings, the wondrous Dharma that brings peace and joy.\n\nThis scripture is the great Dao of transcendence, the marvelous formula for refining the world. It is inherent in all, yet people, lost in delusion, fail to awaken. Those who uphold this true scripture with attainment should aid the world. Why, in this latter age, do selfish thoughts arise? Having gained but a little, they show no compassion to others. Like the people of Qin and Yue, each indifferent to the other’s plight, they neither teach the world at first nor find joy in the end. Their brief enlightenment is soon obscured, and they cannot achieve the Dao—how lamentable!\n\nAlas, to know the scripture yet not deliver the world is wrong. Yet to feign knowledge, delight in being a teacher, and recklessly transmit and initiate others is an even greater error. Only by eliminating these two faults and striving to fully understand this scripture can one universally deliver beings.\n\n**Chapter on Verification, Continued (28)**\nThe upholder of this scripture is called the Luminous Body, for they are constantly embraced by the Imperial Light.\n\nThe upholder of this scripture is not merely a good physician of the body but is named the Luminous Body. Human nature is inherently empty and luminous, illuminating all without obstruction. Yet when qi is constrained by things and obscured by delusion, its brightness is dimmed. The true upholder of this scripture, with nature and heaven radiant, opens the ground of the heart. Light shines constantly, the root of life fuses with essence, like the cloudless vastness of the great void, like the sun and moon alternating in brilliance. Vast and boundless, it flows abundantly.\n\nTruly, the Luminous Body is no defiled or darkened one. They are constantly embraced by the Imperial Light. The *Emperor* is the Jade Emperor. The Imperial Light shines universally, reaching all without exception. Yet people, being base and defiled, find it difficult to receive. Now, the upholder of this scripture treads the light of heaven, their cinnabar radiance illuminating the golden courts. When the cosmos is at peace, the light of heaven emerges. The August Emperor’s presence is manifest, its brilliance suffusing the mysterious void. The upholder of the scripture, looking up, receives it; great harmony and luminous clarity prevail. Embraced by the Imperial Light, the upholder is protected. Having received its transformation, they forever preserve constant purity. Light intermingles and reflects upon the upholder of the scripture.\n\nTheir faith aligns with heaven’s virtue, their brightness merges with that of the sun and moon. It is ever heard that the Dao of heaven descends to aid and illumine, inherently impartial. People receive heaven’s bright mandate, inherently great and luminous. Yet their nature is originally unstained, and the heart treasures emptiness and clarity. People, indulging in desires and pleasures, cannot keep the spirit-terrace free of things, like the sun and moon eclipsed, like clouds and mist obscuring the sky. If one does not adorn their faults, cut off desires, and return to principle, the momentary darkness will swiftly clear. Four directions open, eight reaches connect, and the bright grow brighter. Is there a time when the light of heaven does not shine, when the Imperial Light does not descend? Never has such a thing occurred.\n\nYet people bring ruin upon themselves, abandoning their true nature. Their thoughts swarm ceaselessly, active by day and resting by night, their minds never still for even a moment. What they do is already deluded, and their thoughts are further unclear, opposing heaven. Thus, they obscure the true scripture. A fleeting moment of awareness gives rise to karma. The retribution for sins is severe, and the cycles of suffering are not light. If one cannot swiftly reform and express remorse through words, then heaven cannot be deceived, nor spirits be fooled. People see themselves as if their lungs and liver were exposed—where is this nature that endures such self-deception?\n\nThus, the mandate of heaven’s protection and the Imperial Light’s auspicious embrace must belong to those who truly uphold the scripture, cultivate the Dao, and achieve transcendence. The true upholder of the scripture is named the Luminous Body, embraced by the Imperial Light.\n\nAlas, all people are one, and their bright virtue is the same. Why do they not uphold the scripture and fulfill the Dao, thereby meeting the heart of the August Emperor?\n\n**Chapter on Verification, Continued (29)**\nThe upholder of this scripture is called the Self-So Body, for their spirit can roam the wondrous realms of the celestial palaces.\n\nThe merits of upholding this scripture cannot be fully described. The upholder of this scripture is not only named the Luminous Body but also the Self-So Body. The three disasters, four killings, five phases, six harms, seven injuries, eight difficulties, nine stellar calamities, and ten evil karmas—all entanglements are severed, and the roots of karma are forever extinguished. They realize the Three Origins, empty the Five Aggregates, depart from the Four Marks, cut off the hundred wrongs, eliminate the ten thousand existences, transcend kalpas, and attain true liberation as the great Self-So Body.\n\nTheir spirit can roam the wondrous realms of the celestial palaces. The upholder of this scripture, with mysterious powers at will, attains self-mastery of the body. In all celestial palaces and every wondrous realm—whether the azure paths and jade steps, the coiling dragon walls and painted screens, the jade capital and golden towers, the purple courts and yellow chambers, the jasper towers and jade halls, the Jasper Gardens and Jasper Pools, the Mysterious Capital’s upper realms, the secret chambers and cinnabar terraces, the treasure groves and fragrant paths, the vermilion palaces of the spirit chambers, the Dharma bridges and brocade railings, the bright halls and ochre courts—or the jade grasses and gem flowers, ice peaches and snow plums, intersecting pears and flame dates, cinnabar feasts and jasper nectars, the radiance of the Dao and mysterious auspices, the rosy clouds and propitious vapors, the divine chariots and Dharma carriages, the Dharma treasures and celestial beings, the various marvelous flowers, and the contemplative journeys of the spirit—all surpass what ordinary people can attain.\n\nThe merits of upholding this scripture cannot be fully described; this merely hints at their vastness. The various merits of upholding this scripture benefit all beings—whether manifest or hidden, living or dead, past or present. Demons are subdued, the Imperial Light descends, and the spirit roams the celestial realms. Even so, these words do not exhaust its merits, for they are truly boundless.\n\nHow then does the recitation of scripture by the sagely compare? Alas, the power of scripture is supreme. One must hold it with utmost sincerity and perpetuity.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Verifications Continued**\nMoreover, when Daoist practitioners or aspirants establish an altar to recite the scripture, donning fresh and pure garments, at the stillness after midnight—when the true forms of the *kun-kun* characters are concealed in darkness and silence—they should seclude themselves in a pristine chamber, strike their teeth nine times, face east in upright posture, and chant this scripture. At that moment, the Celestial Perfected attend their seats, the Jade Consorts sweep the ritual mats, the myriad spirits array in ranks, the hosts of heavens descend to the altar, the Three Realms stand guard, and the Five Emperors preside over the reception. Those who uphold this scripture become embodiments of twelve virtues, their compassion and salvation boundless.\n\nFurthermore, regarding \"Daoist practitioners or aspirants\": *Daoists* is the general term for those who cultivate the Dao and enter the mysterious. *Aspirants* refers to those of resolve—not to be mistaken for *Perfected Beings*, for only those who attain the Dao and achieve transcendence may be called *Perfected*. Some, upon reading passages about the Celestial Perfected, Jade Consorts, myriad spirits, hosts of heavens, Three Realms, and Five Emperors attending and receiving, assume the text refers to *Perfected Beings*. Yet they fail to recognize that this scripture is an imperial decree, and wherever it resides, the gods provide protection. Even if the reciter is a commoner, an elderly person, or a child, the gods revere them as they would the Emperor. Sincerity in upholding the scripture yields boundless blessings, while negligence invites immediate misfortune. The gods attend and receive out of respect for the true scripture, not necessarily for *Perfected Beings*. Moreover, establishing an altar, donning fresh garments, reciting at midnight in a quiet chamber, striking the teeth nine times, and sitting facing east are standard practices for students reciting scripture—not criteria for *Perfected Beings*. Thus, it is clear the text refers to *aspirants*.\n\nWhen such aspirants, in accordance with the ritual, purify themselves and recite the scripture, at that very moment: the Celestial Perfected attend their seats, the Perfected of all heavens descend to the sacred table. The Jade Consorts sweep the ritual mats—*sweeping* here denotes reverent cleansing, not repulsion, signifying solemn respect. The *mats* are the ritual seats. The myriad spirits array in ranks: just as earthly emperors command their ministers to assemble, this scripture, being the secret words of the Jade Emperor and the decrees of the Primordial Beginning, elevates the reciter to the status of one proclaiming an imperial edict, prompting all spirits to array in attendance. The hosts of heavens descend to the altar: all the Perfected Emperors of the heavens arrive at the sacred table. The Three Realms stand guard: the Three Realms—Heaven, Earth, and the Water Realms—with their divine generals and officials, array to protect. Some say the Three Realms refer to Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, but in the stillness of midnight within a secluded chamber, no humans are present; thus, it undoubtedly refers to the Three Realms of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Others suggest the Three Realms of Desire, Form, and Formlessness, but this is incorrect. The Five Emperors preside over the reception: the Five Emperors are the Five Elders of the Five Directions, the Five Numinous Lords. Some say they are the August Emperors of the Five Peaks. Given the prior mention of the myriad spirits and Three Realms, which include the Five Elders, here it should refer to the myriad spirits of the Five Peaks. Within the Three Realms, the Five Peaks are present, so the Five Elders are appropriate. The scripture contains the Five Elders’ inquiries, and thus, at its opening, the Five Elders preside over the reception of the Dao’s Ancestor. *Preside* means to govern or receive; *receive* means to welcome, embodying the reverence of the Empty Sovereign. Some say *preside over the reception* refers to the spirits of the scripture’s upholder ascending to the mysterious, which is also plausible.\n\nObserving the devotion of scripture recitation, the gods provide full protection; without sincerity, the gods will surely respond in kind. Those who encounter this scripture should hold it with solemn reverence, while those who have not should earnestly seek the opportunity. Be as solemn as if the gods were present, yet do not seek visible effects. Without thought or action, silently uphold the true scripture, and the spirits within your body will forever preserve the mysterious and true. Strive on without negligence.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Verifications Continued**\nMoreover, if one can close their eyes in tranquil contemplation, visualizing the scripture, they will unknowingly find themselves amidst clouds of three colors. Suddenly, their body radiates brilliant light, ascending to the celestial palaces, where the Perfected descend to welcome them. Whatever they request is granted, and elixirs, wondrous treasures, and all desires are attained at will. One should follow the rituals and practice with a devoted heart.\n\nNot only does sincere recitation of the scripture earn the protection of the gods, but one can also close their eyes in tranquil contemplation to reflect on the harms of the Five Aggregates—with form being the foremost. The eyes are the root of form’s disturbance to the mind. Upholding the true scripture requires bodily and mental purity; closing the eyes in stillness naturally stabilizes the mind. Yet the Dao’s profundities cannot be entered without contemplation, while reckless thoughts disrupt the true. Closing the eyes in silent sitting, free from desires, prevents the mind’s chaos, allowing quiet reflection to penetrate the subtle mechanisms—this is the essence of scripture recitation.\n\nNow, regarding \"silent sitting\": some advise half-closing the eyes, not fully shutting them, to avoid descending into a \"ghostly den\"—a state where one is unaware of stray thoughts from the dark realms. If the mind is pure, what harm is there in closing the eyes? Yet, as people’s resolve is often weak, closing the eyes may breed doubt or invite drowsiness, hence the advice to keep them half-open to avoid the demon of sleep. If one can forget both good and evil, even the absence of absence, the true Dao will naturally enter—what harm is there in closing the eyes? The \"half-closed\" teaching is a precaution by the mysterious masters against the demonic delusions of the uncommitted.\n\nMoreover, the meaning of \"half-closing the eyes\" is to refrain from external observation while maintaining inner illumination. The mind remains alert, its light undimmed, akin to the \"drooping curtain\" of governance: though not directly observing, one remains fully aware of all matters. This is the subtle mechanism of Dao cultivation, hence its mention alongside the discussion of scripture.\n\nTo contemplate this scripture is not to summon or grasp its imagery and efficacies, nor to visualize its dharmas as though beholding the Jade Emperor—though one should revere the Dao and ponder the True, never daring to treat it lightly. Merely reciting the scripture with the mouth while silently preserving this mind, delving deeply and exploring its profound principles, embodies the scripture within body and heart. This is what is meant by \"contemplating the scripture,\" until unawares, one finds oneself enveloped in clouds of three colors. These clouds arise from the qi of Heaven and Earth. When the contemplation of the scripture reaches great samadhi, uniting with the heart of Heaven, each thought pure and virtuous, auspicious clouds are born, and one becomes unknowingly surrounded by clouds of blue, yellow, and white. With the heart and body serene and upright, the Dragon and Tiger coil and spiral, hence the appearance of these three-colored clouds. If one’s cultivation of the True reaches completion, five-colored clouds will gather, and ninefold radiance will suffuse—this is yet another level. Suddenly, one sees their body radiant with brilliance, ascending to the Heavenly Palace, where hosts of perfected beings descend to welcome them. *E* signifies a brief moment. Suddenly, one’s bodily light blazes forth, resplendent and glorious. (The remainder of this explanation appears earlier.) If the heart harbors a request, ascending to the Heavenly Palace with a petition, all wondrous treasures and divine elixirs will be offered as desired. All the sublime treasures of the Primordial Jade Emperor will be presented at will, naturally obtained. One should not speak of seeking treasures but of receiving them for oneself. It is fitting to follow the prescribed teachings. With a profound and devoted mind, proceed as explained before. The scripture is the true essence of human nature; silent realization and perpetual adherence suffice. Yet, in terms of contemplation, this may seem a secondary meaning. The Confucian texts say: \"The indistinct and unseen are depicted, the formless is vividly beheld.\" They also say: \"Vast and boundless, as though above one.\" Is this, too, a secondary meaning? Alas, those of superior wisdom are few, while the mediocre are many. Without the practice of contemplation, how can one seek the unheard and unseen, fully unite with Heaven, and transcend the ordinary to enter sagehood? Let the scholar reflect on this.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two of the Verification Section Continued**\nThis scripture is such that all Golden Immortals of the Three Times and Great Sages of the Ten Directions have, by following its teachings in cultivation and devotion, transcended to realize the supreme and wondrous Dao. Here, the Jade Emperor is the Teacher of all Heavens and the King of all Sages. This scripture is not only for those who uphold and recite it but must be followed according to its teachings—even the Golden Immortals of the Three Times (past, present, and future). *Golden Immortals* refers to those whose golden elixir is indestructible, the True Immortals of the Great Mystery. The Great Sages of the Ten Directions—the four cardinal, four intermediate, upper, and lower directions—all the revered deities of the Lingbao tradition, the peerless and boundless Great Sages, have cultivated and devoted themselves to this scripture according to its teachings, as explained before. Thus, they transcend to realize the supreme and wondrous Dao. Differences in cultivation lead to varying degrees of attainment. Until one reaches the stage of Dao verification, it is not the supreme. Beings such as spirit immortals, human immortals, earth immortals, ghost immortals, as well as gods of the Desire, Form, and Formless Realms, bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, arhats, and buddhas, along with Confucian exemplars like transformed sages, great sages, virtuous ones, faithful scholars, and worthies—none of these are the ultimate. Only Heavenly Immortals, the Buddha of Scriptures, and the unknowable Sages surpass them; among gods and Confucians, these are the highest. The Golden Immortals and Great Sages, by single-mindedly following this scripture’s teachings, unite with the True Emperor and thus attain the highest immortality, transcending to realize the supreme, true, and wondrous Dao, free from the karmic fruits of the Heavens’ blessings. Here, the Jade Emperor is the Teacher of all Heavens—the thirty-three heavens, thirty-six heavens, twelve thousand heavens, and the three thousand great worlds—all who realize the great Dao through the *August Scripture*. The Jade Emperor is the Teacher of all Heavens, the transformer who perfects the hosts of perfected beings. He is the King of all Sages, for all immortals, Confucian sages, buddhas, gods of the heavens, and all holy beings yield to his virtue, defer to his merits, and acknowledge his supremacy, revering him through endless kalpas. Alas, when the Heavenly Lord within a person is at peace, the Dao may be attained. If one does not cultivate the heart to awaken and unite virtue with Heaven, vainly revering the Supreme Emperor, it is a grievous error. Beware and reflect on this.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three of the Verification Section Continued**\nTherefore, when an ordinary person encounters this scripture and cultivates it with single-minded devotion, they may even command the Five Emperors as their assistants, summon and employ the hosts of immortals, direct and govern the spirit officials, and guide the workings of yin and yang. A thousand spirits will revere them, ten thousand gods will submit in awe, all evil will avoid their path, and the myriad demons will constrain their forms. After the end of their life, they will immediately undergo refinement in the Southern Palace, ascend to the Upper Clarity, and roam freely and at ease, abiding with the Dao forever. It is not only the Golden Immortals and great worthies who realize the Dao through this scripture. Therefore, when an ordinary person encounters this scripture—an ordinary being of the world who, by karmic conditions, meets this scripture and cultivates it with single-minded devotion—even the Five Emperors (the Five Elder Sovereigns, not the Five Sacred Peaks) will assist their progress and support their shortcomings. They may summon and employ the hosts of immortals, directing and commanding the spirit officials. *Summon and employ* means to issue commands, and the immortals will obey; *direct and command* means to control and dispatch, and the spirit officials will serve. As the scripture says: \"Those who cultivate the Dao may command ghosts and drive away spirits.\" Though an ordinary person, through single-minded devotion to the scripture, the power of the Dao subdues them, enabling them to summon immortals and command spirits, guiding the workings of yin and yang. Only with utmost sincerity and singular focus, faithfully upholding this scripture, can one naturally govern creation, harmonizing yin and yang. A thousand spirits will revere them, a thousand spirits will honor and look up to them. Ten thousand gods will submit in awe—*submit* meaning to be struck with reverent fear and obedience; *awe* meaning to restrain their spirits and submit silently. The ten thousand gods submit without need for coercion. All evil will avoid their path, and the myriad demons will constrain their forms, daring not to appear.\n\nUpon the end of one’s allotted span, the liberation shall be as foretold. They shall attain refinement in the Southern Palace—the Southern Palace being the Vermilion Mound Prefecture, the palace for refining and delivering souls. *Refinement* here denotes the process of being tempered and delivered in the Southern Palace. They shall ascend to the Upper Clarity by flying steps, their spirit soaring to the celestial realms of Upper Clarity—though this is not the true Upper Clarity realm, but merely an expression of ascension to heaven. They shall roam freely and at ease, spared the trials of hell, exempt from karmic retribution, unbound and unshackled, carefree and unfettered. They shall abide with the Dao in perpetuity. From the moment they first uphold this scripture, though not yet perfected, through single-minded devotion and reverent practice, their heart resonates with the Dao, unobstructed and untethered. Their hun-soul and spirit purified, they shall no longer suffer dissolution or descent, but endure with the Dao forever. This is what the Daoist canon means by \"death yet not perishing,\" and what the Buddhist scriptures call \"awakening and thus liberation.\" If even an ordinary person, through single-minded devotion to this scripture, may attain such efficacy, then the power of utmost sincerity is evident. Though of humble intellect, one may yet fulfill the Dao—let the reader take heed.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: Manifest Verifications**\n\nMoreover, when sentient beings in the world hear this scripture and their hearts arise in longing and reverence, they may choose a pure and secluded place within their homes to enshrine the image of the August Lord. Day and night, they shall offer devout worship, morning incense rising in abundance, with fragrant flowers, lamps, fruits, and solemn offerings. They shall honor and venerate, chant the sacred names, gaze in reverence, and recite the scripture. Such a person shall attain thirty sublime virtues:\n\nFirst, the praise and esteem of all immortals;\nSecond, the rebirth of departed ancestors in heaven;\nThird, the dissolution of past misfortunes;\nFourth, unimpeded passage wherever they go;\n\n**Fifth,** freedom from theft and banditry;\n**Sixth,** the fulfillment of all desires;\n**Seventh,** deliverance from water and fire calamities;\n**Eighth,** the silent dissolution of misfortunes;\n**Ninth,** auspicious dreams at night;\n**Tenth,** immunity from illness;\n**Eleventh,** wisdom and keen intelligence;\n**Twelfth,** delight in the sight of others;\n**Thirteenth,** abundance in clothing and food;\n**Fourteenth,** honor and nobility for descendants—let them be virtuous and pure, free from baseness, ignominy, or early death, and all shall be well;\n**Fifteenth,** joy among the six relations;\n**Sixteenth,** harmony within the clan;\n**Seventeenth,** eradication of the three evil retributions;\n**Eighteenth,** transformation of a woman’s body into a man’s;\n**Nineteenth,** a dignified and majestic appearance;\n**Twentieth,** appointment as a great minister of the state;\n**Twenty-first,** birth as the son of an emperor;\n**Twenty-second,** reverence and admiration from ghosts and spirits;\n**Twenty-third,** attainment of knowledge of past lives—all karmic obstructions dissolved, and life’s path made smooth;\n**Twenty-fourth,** protection and mindfulness from all deities;\n**Twenty-fifth,** the nine clans receiving blessings—the nine clans being: high ancestors, great-grandparents, grandparents, parents, oneself, children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren; or, alternatively, three clans on the father’s side, three on the mother’s, and three on the wife’s;\n**Twenty-sixth,** longevity in the world;\n**Twenty-seventh,** all sentient beings relying on one’s virtuous merit;\n**Twenty-eighth,** the demon kings safeguarding and welcoming;\n**Twenty-ninth,** transcending the three realms of desire, form, and formlessness in succession;\n**Thirtieth,** ascension in broad daylight.\n\nThough immortals ascend in varied ways—not all necessarily rising bodily in daylight—those who attain this state become as vast as the great void, their spirits roaming the Jade Capital: this is ascension in broad daylight.\n\nDevout reverence for this scripture and the August Lord yields such merits, yet one must first utterly renounce secret desires, seek no verification of effects, and persist without interruption. When the heart aligns with heaven, efficacy follows; even if it does not, no harm comes from doing good. Should one covet verification, they have not truly transmitted the scripture of the August Lord. Let the reader take heed.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Further Manifest Verifications**\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies, saying: The merits of this scripture can shatter the Iron Enclosure and all mountains, drain the waters of the Sea of Suffering, break open the great hells, and liberate all from sin and suffering. It subdues violent demons, protects all lands, annihilates all evil spirits, cures all grave illnesses, dissolves all poisons, severs ties with all wicked people, tames all venomous beasts, and overthrows all heterodox paths. All the heavens revere it, and its remaining merits are beyond enumeration.\n\nDevout reverence for this scripture and the August Lord yields thirty kinds of merit.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy again addressed the four assemblies, saying: The merits of this scripture can crush the Yin Feng and Iron Enclosure mountains, purifying all past defilements. It dries the waves of the Sea of Suffering, allowing one to turn back and ascend its shores. It shatters the great hells, stilling delusive conditions. It uproots all sin and suffering, severing karmic roots to forever end retribution. It subdues violent demons, restraining their fierce and malevolent perversity. It protects all lands, bringing purity and peace, enriching nations and securing the people. It annihilates all evil spirits, eradicating the dark and malevolent. It cures all grave illnesses, eliminating all defilements. It dissolves all poisons, dispelling worldly toxins and the great inner poisons of the body. It severs ties with all wicked people—either preventing encounters or causing them to flee at one’s sight. It tames all venomous beasts, pacifying the world’s poisonous creatures.\n\nMoreover, those who cultivate the Dao—through the transformation of yin qi—command countless dragons, fierce beasts, giant serpents, and lions, each in the hundreds of millions, to guard this true scripture, rendering them docile and eternally protective.\n\nIt shatters all heterodox ways, crushing the world’s myriad deviant paths and demolishing one’s own deluded attachments. All the heavens—every realm’s celestial beings—naturally revere and honor this scripture. Its remaining virtues are beyond enumeration; as previously described, the merits of this scripture dissolve calamities and their transformations, eradicate disasters and their poisons, transform all without exception, and benefit all without limit. It is the great expedient, the supreme dharma among all teachings. Though uttered in the subtle words of the utmost sagely, it is the very function of one’s inherent nature. Strive diligently, and merit will naturally manifest.\n\n**Chapter on Manifest Verification, Continuation of the Thirty-Sixth**\n\nAt that time, the assembly in the Dao altar—Golden Immortals, Bodhisattvas, and the retinue of Perfected Sages—having heard this teaching, rejoiced with exultation. They bowed their heads in reverence and offered this hymn of praise:\n\nGreat is the supreme Dao,\nPeerless, the Most High Perfected.\nAbove, it delivers the heavens;\nBelow, it rescues the lost souls.\nWithout master or ancestor,\nThe Dao alone is its body.\nCinnabar Terrace and Purple Palace,\nGolden Gates and Jade Capital—\nHere is concealed this wondrous dharma,\nBestowing blessings upon all beings,\nErasing my ten thousand sins,\nProlonging my distant years.\nMyriad spirits pay homage,\nDemon kings guard and welcome.\nVirtues flourish and prosper,\nMy name inscribed in the Yellow Register.\nThrough boundless eons,\nMay I endure forever.\n\nWhen the assembly had finished reciting this hymn, they bowed their heads in homage, took their leave, and departed.\n\nAt that time, the assembly in the Dao altar—the place where the Dao is expounded—Golden Immortals, Bodhisattvas, and the retinue of Perfected Sages, having heard the scripture’s conclusion, rejoiced with exultation, their joy overflowing. They bowed their heads in reverence and offered this hymn:\n\nGreat is the supreme Dao,\nVast beyond measure,\nUtmost and unattainable.\nPeerless, the Most High Perfected,\nWithout origin or beginning,\nThe highest and most true.\nAbove, it delivers the heavens,\nIts transformation pervading the heights.\nBelow, it rescues the lost souls,\nIts transformation penetrating the nether darkness,\nAll lingering spirits ascending.\nWithout master or ancestor,\nNo teacher, no progenitor.\nThe Dao alone is its body—\nIn praising this scripture,\nThe Dao is its essence.\nCinnabar Terrace and Purple Palace,\nRealm of the Great Mystery’s wonders.\nGolden Gates and Jade Capital—\nAs previously described.\nHere is concealed this wondrous dharma,\nSecret and treasured.\nBestowing blessings upon all beings,\nOr universally delivering all.\nErasing my ten thousand sins,\nThis scripture extinguishes all transgressions.\nProlonging my distant years,\nThis scripture extends life.\nMyriad spirits pay homage,\nRevering this scripture.\nDemon kings guard and welcome\nThose who uphold it.\nVirtues flourish and prosper,\nVast and all-pervading, enduring and boundless.\nMy name inscribed in the Yellow Register,\nRecorded in the immortal ledgers of the Mystic Capital,\nOn golden tablets and yellow registers.\nThrough boundless eons,\nVast and limitless, countless kalpas.\nMay those who uphold this scripture endure forever.\n\nWhen the assembly of Perfected Ones had finished reciting this hymn, they bowed their heads in homage, took refuge in *The Supreme Jade Emperor’s Original Acts Sutra*, and departed from the presence of the Most High Sage.\n\n**Thus concludes the lower scroll of *The Supreme Jade Emperor’s Original Acts Sutra*.**",

This work gathers commentaries on the *Jade Emperor Scripture* from the Song, Jin, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, with an appended commentary on the *Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal Scripture*. Ten fascicles in total.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.\n\n---\n\n**Fascicle One of the Commentaries on the Jade Emperor Scripture**\n\n**Preface to the Collected Commentaries on the Jade Emperor Scripture**\n\nComposed by the Heavenly Marshal of Harmonious Response, the Heavenly Worthy of Concordant Virtue\n\nThe Great Dao is formless, yet it subtly initiates the myriad things;\nThe Perfect Truth is imageless, yet it gathers the hearts of all to return of their own accord.\nIts mechanism is like a great bell—struck, it responds at once.\nHow vast is the Supreme Sage! Sincerity alone suffices to commune with it.\n\nWe reverently regard the *Original Acts Scripture* as the secret words of the Mysterious Emperor, the pivotal essence of the boundless heavens.\nIn the Floating Black True Realm, it records the first transmission of the Dao;\nIn the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, it reveals the traces of its sealed mysteries.\nTruly, it is the hidden melody of all heavens, the immortal verses of the Great Brahmā.\nWhen the Eight Trigrams faced ruin, it was due to the imperial brush;\nWhen the thousand perfected stood in guard, it universally delivered the numinous spirits of humanity.\nWho can fathom its kalpas? Who can know its ages?\nFor the multitudes of the great earth, deluded and lost, have forsaken their true nature, destroyed their original forms, and indulged in sensual desires, unable to cleanse themselves—thus the sacred text remained hidden.\n\nToday, as jade emerges from Kun Mountain and pearls divide from the vast sea, we have obtained this luminous scripture, prostrating in awe and wonder.\nIt is said: those imprisoned in darkness, yearning for its wondrous meaning, may be redeemed at the source;\nThose afflicted with chronic illness, gazing upon its virtuous resonance, may be instantly cured.\nIt is a torch in the gloom, a vessel upon the abyss—preserving the state, pacifying the household, aiding the living, and delivering the dead.\nInscribed on golden tablets and jade scrolls, its vastness is beyond measure.\nWithout reverence for the true wind, how can one grasp this principle?\nI humbly set forth its essentials to enlighten those yet unenlightened.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Collected Scripture on the Original Acts of the Supreme Jade Emperor**\n\nThe Dao is fundamentally wordless, yet all scriptures are the traces of true sages’ discourse. Words reveal the Dao, and even sages and worthies do not abandon them.\nSince the division of the Three Powers and the establishment of the teachings of names, principle has remained unified—yet the deluded may diverge from it, and divergence is not the Way.\n\nBefore the kalpas began, the Primordial Beginning sat in illumination. When the time and destiny were ripe, the perfected ones inquired of the Jade Emperor regarding his causal acts, and thus he expounded this scripture.\nIt is the most venerable of dharma categories, the foremost of numinous texts—no scripture since has equaled it.\nIts true words are profound and recondite, eschewing ornate embellishment. Though its Brahmā-verse is self-contained, its purport is inexhaustible; even the sages cannot speak of it, nor can thought or contemplation reach it. Yet this scripture encompasses all, as clear as the palm of one’s hand.\n\nYour servant, Zhang Zhong, served in the civil administration of the Zhou dynasty, entrusted with affairs by the Supreme Emperor. Upon hearing this scripture, he vowed to treasure and uphold it to the end.\nWhen the Emperor reviewed the merits and transgressions of humanity, he recorded that your servant Zhong walked the path of loyalty and filial piety, and commanded him to oversee the transformation of the Nine Heavens and compile this scripture.\nWithin its profound mysteries, he savored its richness to the fullest.\n\nAlas! Those who study this scripture in the world fail to embody the sagely intent, to grasp the profound essence. Erroneous carvings and misguided transmissions have led to distortions in its verses, splitting it into two names—*Cavernous Mystery* and *Supreme*—each clinging to private interpretations in transmission, greatly deviating from the intent of the scripture’s exposition. Some even adhere rigidly like tuning pegs to a zither.\nThe reckless and absurd may disbelieve this scripture, or claim it borrows from other texts, or force interpretations in ignorance—all unaware of the scripture’s supremacy, and that the retributions of blessings and misfortunes cannot be escaped. How grievous is their error!\n\nYour servant Zhong could not bear the loss of this magnificent canon, nor the folly of the vulgar world, which, in ignorance, offends without hearing the Great Dao.\nHe memorialized the Emperor’s command, enlisting immortal perfected ones to explicate the scripture’s meaning, disseminating it among the mortal realm as the key to exhaustive study and the ladder to the human Dao.\nMay this sacred canon serve as a vessel, rescuing those long drowned;\nMay this wondrous medicine of the Mysterious Tradition readily cure chronic ailments.\nThose who hear the scripture and awaken to the Dao shall never speak recklessly;\nThose who respond to the moment and recognize the true shall forever escape the wheel of rebirth.\nAcross the three thousand great thousand worlds, every realm shall become a domain of supreme harmony;\nFrom kalpa to kalpa, every generation shall be a scene of joy and benefit.\nThose who seek the Dao shall surely attain it; no wish shall go unfulfilled.\nThe merit of this scripture shall thus be without fail.\n\nI respectfully inscribe this preface.\n\n**Zhang Zhong, Minister of the Nine Heavens’ Civilizing Transformation and the Venerable Emperor of Literary Florescence, prostrates and bows a hundred times.**\n\n---\n\n**On the Original Dao**\n\nComposed by the Venerable Immortal of the Southern Culmen, the Aged Recluse",

      "translated_text": "The Venerable Immortal of the Southern Culmen says: Tracing the origins of Daoist teachings, we find that in the primordial chaos before separation, the human Dao was not yet complete. Heaven commanded our Dao Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor of Xuanyuan, to inherit the mandate of the Nine August Ones, to grasp the reins of the Six Dragons and ascend the heavens, to establish the celestial pole on behalf of Heaven, and to stabilize the Three Powers.\n\nAt that time, Heaven and Earth had not yet become distinct; there were no written characters, so knotted cords served in place of governance. There were no houses, so people dwelt in nests and caves. There were no garments, so they bound grasses to cover their bodies. There were no utensils, so they drank from cupped hands and hollowed vessels. Our Dao Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor of Xuanyuan, first created written characters, fashioned clothing, built palaces, and crafted utensils, thereby completing human affairs.\n\nAmong the Nine Schools and within the Three Teachings, the written characters in use, the clothing worn, the houses inhabited, and the vessels employed all originated with the Yellow Emperor—all derived from the teachings of our Daoist school and the Yellow Emperor. Moreover, Laozi said that what gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the myriad things must itself have a source, which he did not know by name, so he provisionally called it the *Dao* and provisionally wrote it as *Great*, hence the *Great Dao*. Its teaching is called *Daoism*, and from this the world first acquired the term *Dao*.\n\nThus, all who speak of cultivating the Dao or studying the Dao are borrowing Laozi’s words and using *Dao* as their name. Are they not disciples of Laozi? Furthermore, Laozi’s phrase “mysterious and yet more mysterious, the gateway to all wonders” has also been borrowed and used in scriptures—all employing Laozi’s words. Likewise, the *Book of Zhuangzi* states: “Only after the Great Awakening does one know the sage.” These two characters, *Great Awakening*, were coined by Zhuangzi; Emperor Huizong of Song later adopted them to honor the Golden Immortal. All such terms in the scriptures derive from the writings of our Daoist school, from the teachings of the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, and Zhuangzi.\n\nIn the preface to the *Commentary on the August Scripture*, it is said: The character *Dao* is revered equally by the Three Teachings. Yet reckless and deluded fools regard the Dao as a lesser vehicle, showing their ignorance. The Jade Emperor is honored by all Three Teachings. Some blind followers call him the Heavenly Lord and criticize this as insufficiently reverent, failing to understand the root and origin of the Jade Emperor’s conduct. The Emperor’s virtue is boundless; his merits, once accomplished, are indestructible. His position is most exalted, his name most supreme; he governs the myriad heavens and encompasses the Three Teachings. Across the three thousand great thousand worlds, he moves through kalpas with effortless mastery. Confucians call him the Supreme Emperor; Buddhists name him Dipamkara; Daoists title him the Mysterious Lord—his dignity is peerless.\n\nWhoever reads this scripture will understand the Emperor’s wondrous deeds and resolve millennia of doubts and myriad confusions. Yet those who remain ignorant, who do not grasp the scriptural text, continue to speak recklessly, failing to awaken and thereby deepening their transgressions. How can they recognize that human life originates from the Dao, is governed by the Supreme Emperor, and is enlightened by the sagely teachings? To slight the Emperor is to disrespect Heaven; to slander the scripture is to fail to comprehend the Great Dao—this is to turn one’s back on one’s roots and forget one’s origins, to misunderstand the source of life and creation.\n\nI, Yan, have long lamented this and thus place this preface at the beginning of the commentary as a warning.\n\n**Minister Lü Yan, the Pure Yang Admonishing and Transforming Protector Emperor, prostrates and bows a hundred times in reverence.**\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Second Continuation of the *Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture***\n\nThe existence of scriptures for the Dao is like the sun and moon in the sky or the statutes and canons of a nation. Gazing upon the sun and moon prevents the folly of facing a wall; following the laws of former kings ensures no transgressions. Thus, venerating and believing in the true scriptures is surely the standard for entering the Dao.\n\nMoreover, this scripture was personally transmitted by the Primordial Beginning, proclaimed by the Jade Emperor and the various deities—it is the highest rank among the Three Teachings, the secret words of the Great Sage, worthy of reverence in every place and esteemed in every kalpa. Yet the Dao is wordless; this scripture has already given it form through language. Why then is a commentary needed? The scripture, expressed in written words, is understood only by those who have attained the Dao. For those who have not yet entered the gate, it is deeply dependent upon this.\n\nOtherwise, crossing a river without a raft—how can one reach the shore? Alas! To abandon the scripture in seeking the Dao is wrong; to cling to the scripture as the Dao is also wrong.",

It is like an ant attempting to bear a mountain, revealing only my incapacity. Yet the Great Dao does not reject the lowly, and even humble study may yield understanding. Though the Jade Canon is profound, the immortals have elucidated its mysteries. When the late Grand Historian Luo entrusted this work to me, to omit it from the Canon would be to conceal a celestial treasure; to include it, however, left me uneasy.

      "translated_text": "**Investigation of the Origins of the Dao**\n\nThe Dao in its essence is formless and nameless—who could fathom its source, or from what would one begin to examine it? Yet since the Primordial Beginning divided and transformed, the Great Void conceived wondrous existence, and the Dao’s mysteries became manifest, names were thereby established. The True One embraces the Three, and the Three Teachings stand therein. Being and non-being, end and beginning—none lie beyond the Five Phases. Aeon after aeon they give rise to one another; sage after sage they transmit the lineage—all is the Dao. Even those who leap beyond the Three Realms and stand apart from the Five Phases cannot escape being counted among those who attain the Dao. Thus, the Dao’s revelation is the very origin of the term \"Daoist school.\" Therefore, we first examine this in our search for the origins of the scriptures.\n\n**Investigation of the Origins of the Scriptures**\n\nScriptures serve to convey the Dao, acting as the compassionate vessel for delivering the world. All scriptures are the sacred teachings of perfected beings, containing nothing but the supreme principle. Yet this scripture unfolds from the Primordial Beginning and takes its transformative source from the Jade Emperor. The Primordial Beginning is the foremost of the Three Teachings; the Jade Emperor is the origin of the myriad dharmas. This scripture is of the utmost mystery and wonder, uniquely crowning the Three Teachings; it is also the sovereign of all scriptures, enduring through infinite kalpas. Its revelation extends from the beginningless past, concealed in the Dark Heavens and treasured within the Jade Summit. Its characters are no ordinary script—each spans a full *zhang*, their radiance boundless. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, responding to the times, took up his brush and transcribed it for transmission to the world. Such is the origin of this scripture’s promulgation. Thus, we continue our investigation by tracing the lineage of the Dao’s transmission.\n\n**Investigation of the Lineage and Manifestations of the Jade Emperor, Supreme Master of the Myriad Dharmas and Sacred Ancestor of the Mysterious Teachings**\n\nMasters deliver the world, shattering delusion and rescuing beings from suffering. They transmit the Dao and bestow scriptures, opening the future and continuing the past. The Great Dao’s Mysterious Master unifies the Three Teachings, encompasses the myriad dharmas, dwells in the Heaven within Heaven, and stands as the Sage among Sages—without beginning or end, his origin transcends all inquiry, existing before the ten thousand forms. Yet the Dao’s wondrous manifestations divide into truth: he appears in the Radiant and Majestic Land of Joy, a manifestation from a past kalpa. The world observes the luminous yang of the celestial Dao—yang governs bestowal, its mechanism ever active—hence they honor the Emperor as the Great Emperor Zhang. The deluded, failing to grasp this principle, mistakenly claim that the Zhang clan of Xingtang in the former Northern Zhili (now Hebei) are descendants of the Jade Emperor. How could they know that the Xingtang Zhang clan are merely descendants of Zhang Guo and successors of Zhang the Immortal? How could these be conflated in discussion? This is but an investigation of surnames and worldly lineages.",

      "translated_text": "If we discuss lineage, the Jade Emperor is the foremost emanation of the Great Dao, the primordial ancestor of kalpas vast—how could he have birth, death, or a mortal name? The Jade Emperor’s sacred consort, divine children, and retinue were all palace attendants from his time as Radiant and Majestic Crown Prince. When the Emperor ascended, his entire court attained the Dao. Essentially, the Empress and her attendants were not truly female in form; all were celestial perfected beings. To deliver the multitude of beings, they manifested as female bodies—this has already been explained. It is like the Buddha attaining the Way while his wife and children achieved sagehood. Regard the Jade Emperor as the progenitor of the Dao: the myriad beings of countless kalpas, all life born of heaven and earth, are but offshoots of the Dao’s lineage. Who among them is not part of the Jade Emperor’s retinue and system? Once the attendants of the Great Brahma Palace attain the Dao, they become celestial perfected beings. For example, Mañjuśrī presides over the Immaculate World, and the Dragon Girl attained the Way and transformed into a male body—this principle is the same. Yet today’s monks, Daoists, and laypeople, failing to grasp this truth, mistakenly believe the Jade Emperor has a mortal court, undergoes rebirth, and attains only the Two Vehicles’ fruition. How could they know that while the heavens may perish, the Three Clarities’ realm and the Great Brahma Heaven are imperishable? While the gods of the heavens undergo rebirth, the Jade Emperor does not. For the Jade Emperor is the embodiment of the Dao, and the Dao is boundless—how could the Jade Emperor be finite? Truly, he is the supreme teacher of all Buddhas of the One Vehicle, the King of the Myriad Heavens, and his court is but the wondrous transformation of the Dao. Such is the outline of the profound lineage. Scholars must not speak carelessly; let them examine this investigation in detail.\n\n**Record of the Merits of Engraving Scriptures**\nIn the most ancient times, scriptures had no paper or brushes; they were recorded on bamboo and wooden slips. When Meng Tian and Cai Lun invented paper and brushes, scriptures were transcribed thereafter. Later, lofty scholars engraved printing blocks to reproduce them, doubling the merit. Yet deluded followers of heterodox paths, unaware that Meng and Cai received blessings in Tuṣita Heaven, claim these two men suffered karmic retribution in hell. In truth, the two descended into the underworld under the guidance of the Most High Lord of Salvation from Suffering and the Underworld Lord Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva, bearing scriptures to deliver those condemned for heretical teachings. How could they have endured hell’s torments? Their merit was immense, for they advanced the propagation of scriptures and teachings.\n\n**Record of the True Benefits of Recitation, Dissemination, and Exegesis**\nRecitation and exegesis require utmost sincerity, free from defilement, attachment, or delusion—such merit accords with the scriptures’ words. Printing and distributing scriptures yield even greater merit, for they widely disseminate the Dharma’s treasures. To treat scriptures lightly, slander them, or defile them incurs grave transgressions. Be diligent, be warned, and do not betray the teachings of sages and worthies.\n\n**Investigation of the Jade Emperor’s Sacred Titles and Their Variations**\nThe Jade Emperor’s sacred titles have been revered since before the kalpas vast; in the middle ancient era, they were further exalted and repeatedly praised. As worldly rulers embraced the Dao and received the mysterious grace, each honored what they witnessed and revered. Matters aligned with the times, and merits manifested in the world. As their manifestations became evident, all people saw and heard, venerating the titles of the various deities to establish proper appellations. There are four Jade Emperors: the first is the Great Tenuous Jade Emperor, the title bestowed by Emperor Wu of Han upon the ruler of the Great Tenuous Enclosure; the second is the Brahma Heaven Jade Emperor, the title bestowed by Emperor Xuan of Han upon the ruler of the Heavenly Market Enclosure; the third is the Fiery Splendor Lesser Tenuous Jade Emperor, the title bestowed by Emperor Ai of Han upon the precelestial fixed position; the fourth is the Purple Ultimate Jade Emperor, the title bestowed by Emperor Guangwu of Han upon the postcelestial Qian trigram. None of these are this Jade Emperor. This Jade Emperor’s titles are Supreme Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Vast Heaven, the Most Honored, the Spontaneously Wondrous Existent, the Perfected of Miraculous Radiance, the Jade Sovereign Lord of Heaven, also called the Most High August Jade Emperor of the Mysterious Firmament. He governs all heavens, eternally indestructible and imperishable. Yet the world, failing to investigate thoroughly, erroneously equates him with Śakra, unaware that the Jade Emperor’s titles differ entirely. The four Jade Emperors are all under the dominion of the Most High Jade Emperor. Those who speak of the Four Heavenly Emperors as equals of this Jade Emperor are also mistaken. Those who comprehend heaven will understand this.\n\n**Investigation of the Jade Emperor’s Governance and Supreme Authority**\nMaster Ge Xian said: The heavens of the world appear the same to all. Confucians speak of one heaven and earth, one Lord on High. Daoists speak of thirty billion myriad great Dharma realms, each with thirty-six heavens, each heaven with its own emperor—all under the dominion of the Most High Jade Emperor. Buddhists speak of three thousand great thousand-worlds, each with thirty-two heavens, each heaven with its own Jade Emperor. The three teachings’ discourses seem divergent. Yet when they speak of one heaven, they refer to the Great Void beyond, acknowledging its boundlessness, hence the thirty billion myriad. Beyond this, they also speak of the inconceivable. When they speak of three thousand great thousand-worlds, beyond this, they also speak of the immeasurable. Thus, Confucians speak of following the Lord’s decree and say the sage emulates heaven. Heaven’s essence is boundless; even through kalpas, epochs, and generations, this principle holds. Therefore, the Lord on High is unchanging. Daoists speak of the Most High’s formless void, the true Emperor as indestructible; Buddhists speak of true suchness and self-mastery, eternally unretrogressive. All affirm that the Jade Emperor is imperishable. Thus, to speak of one heaven is not to neglect the vast; it is to name the whole, which is nondual with the profound and the Buddhist. To speak of thirty billion myriad or three thousand great thousand-worlds is not a falsehood; it is to enumerate parts, which aligns with the Confucians. As for the Buddhist claim that each heaven has its own Jade Emperor, each realm has its own ultimate. The Daoist claim that all realms share this Jade Emperor means all realms are one and infinite. Whether called the Great Void, the inconceivable, or the immeasurable, all know the Dao is unchanging and the Jade Emperor eternally present. If one divides worlds and claims the Jade Emperors differ, does this mean the principle of infinity is dual? If one asserts that with the passage of kalpas the Lord on High perishes, does this mean the principle of infinity is destructible? Knowing the Dao is indestructible, the Jade Emperor is eternally present. This is certain; do not cling to demonic doctrines to slander the sacred.\n\n**Investigation of the Jade Emperor’s Pure Tenuous Heavenly Realm**\nWang Chongyang said: The Pure Tenuous is the most profound and subtle realm of heaven, what Daoists call the Heaven of the Seeded People, Confucians call the Beyond of the Vast and Formless, the ever-indestructible azure expanse, and Buddhists call the unretrogressive realm.",

      "translated_text": "Within the miscellaneous writings of Chan Buddhism, erroneous claims place the Jade Emperor atop Mount Sumeru, identifying Him with the Heaven of the Sun and Moon or the Heaven of the Four Kings—realms subject to destruction—while asserting that only Maitreya’s Inner Court remains an unretrogressive domain. Some further speak of the \"Milo Enclosure\" or \"Mila Garden,\" three variant names derived from the Daoist scriptures’ Supreme Primordial Lord, referring to the same transcendent realm: the Pure Tenuous Heaven of the Jade Emperor’s abode in the Mysterious True Realm of Milo. The Heaven of the Sun and Moon and the Heaven of the Four Kings, however, are but the dwelling of the Supreme Tenuous Jade Emperor, not that of the Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Jade Emperor. Thus, the Daoist scriptures state: \"Atop the Mysterious Valley Mountain resides the Imperial Lord, who pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Jade Emperor.\" The Mysterious Valley Mountain is none other than the Chan Buddhist Mount Sumeru, where the Lord of the Sun and Moon governs as the deity presiding over this heaven—akin to the present-day Prefect of the Imperial Capital. Hence, the Buddhist sutras describe the scene of the Tathāgata expounding the Dharma while Śakra, Lord of the Devas, holds an umbrella overhead, much like a newly minted *zhuangyuan* ascending the golden hall, where the Ministry of Rites raises a toast, and the Prefect of the Capital unfurls an umbrella to signify the court’s honor for the worthy. Yet heretical currents have mistaken Śakra, who merely holds the umbrella, for the Most High Jade Emperor, as if equating the Prefect of the Capital with the Emperor himself. Such errors are egregious, and distortions of this kind abound.\n\nWithin these miscellaneous writings, it is further claimed that Mount Kunlun has eight distinct locations. Though the eight directions may be spoken of, they ultimately converge in the northwest—the Qian trigram’s head, the Kunlun of the northwest. What the Confucians call the \"Pillar of Heaven and the Web of Earth\" is none other than the Daoist Mysterious Valley Mountain and the Buddhist Mount Sumeru. How could there be eight such mountains? Yet the world has long perpetuated this misconception, and thus, in examining the Pure Tenuous Heavenly Realm, these errors are addressed to caution those who propagate such fallacies.\n\n**Investigation of the Jade Emperor’s Rank of Honor**\nLiu Haichan said: Within Daoism, the Jade Emperor is the transformation of the Three Pure Ones. The Daoist tradition first speaks of the Three Pure Ones as preceding the Void and Nothingness before the Wondrous Existence, referring to the Wuji and Taiji—realms without distinction of honor or inferiority. In Buddhism, He is Dipamkara Buddha, manifesting as the body of Śākyamuni Buddha. Chan Buddhists prioritize the Buddha over the Jade Emperor, reflecting the foreign custom of revering their own sovereign before the Emperor of China. Yet when examining the Dao’s hierarchy of honor, *The Golden Wheel Sutra* states: \"The Jade Dipper’s Mysterious Mandate rides forth, as the spirit soars to the Supreme Ultimate. The Five Planets lead as envoys, while Śakra and Brahmā serve as attendants.\" Śakra and Brahmā here represent the immortals, Buddhas, and bodhisattvas. The Emperor’s trust in the Three Pure Ones and the Buddha is but a manifestation to guide sentient beings toward the Dao. Yet worldly currents, failing to trace the source, arbitrarily assign ranks, demoting the Jade Emperor to a secondary honor—as if there were beings in the world greater than the Emperor. Some even compare the Three Pure Ones and the Buddha to retired emperors, distorting the sequence of the Jade Emperor’s prior and subsequent manifestations. To liken those of different surnames and titles to father and son is an even graver transgression.\n\nAlas! Just as the world cannot exist without the Jade Emperor, so too must all life have ancestors and parents. To slander the Supreme Emperor and establish rival sects is to abandon one’s ancestors and parents in pursuit of self-exaltation. How can this be permitted?\n\n**Investigation of the Jade Emperor’s Beneficent Titles**\nLan Caihe said: People know to revere the Supreme Emperor but do not invoke His sacred titles. Some Confucians claim that reciting them is improper, unaware that Mencius spoke of \"the great filial son who cherishes his parents all his life.\" To cherish one’s parents with a sincere heart is to be a filial child; to invoke the Emperor’s titles with a sincere heart, ensuring no transgressions, is this not to be a true child of Heaven and Earth? To embody the form perfectly is to align with Heaven and Earth, and the benefits shall be boundless.\n\n**Investigation of the Benefits of the *August Emperor’s Scripture***\nZhang Ziyang said: Where there is the rise of an emperor, there must be the establishment of imperial institutions. Those who adhere to these institutions do not err. How much more so with the *August Emperor’s Scripture*, the heart-seal of the Dao’s essential teaching? To embody it is to become a sage—how could it merely prevent transgressions? Yet people today doubt its benefits, for they have not sincerely practiced its recitation and upholding. Let the wise reflect on this.\n\n**Investigation of the Merits and Transgressions in Collating the Emperor’s Scripture**\nZhongli Zi said: All beings arise from the Dao, their true nature derived from the Heavenly Emperor. Thus, virtue moves Heaven, and blessings naturally follow. Even in poverty and lowliness, one’s peace and joy surpass others—this is the true Hall of Blessings. Evil, however, is self-inflicted calamity, as Heaven sends down misfortune. Even in wealth and nobility, one’s misfortune and woe become a living hell. Fortune and misfortune are fixed, following one’s goodness or evil; the resonance between Heaven and humanity is swifter than an echo. Yet deluded beings do not believe, and thus the merit-recorded adage states: \"To truly recite one volume of the *August Emperor’s Scripture* is to accumulate a thousand virtues, ascending to the Heavenly Hall.\" True recitation unifies inner and outer, aligning speech and conduct with the Dao—not merely chanting the scripture with the mouth, but embodying goodness in every thought. How excellent!\n\nWang Lingguan said: \"Why trouble skilled hands to depict my image? I only wish your heart aligns with mine.\" To align one’s heart with the Supreme Emperor is to cultivate virtue and blessings in tandem—this is true recitation and meritorious goodness. All else—reciting scriptures, restraining speech, and disciplining the mind; venerating the prescribed years and months—though blessed, yields results commensurate with the magnitude of one’s goodness, and thus ranks secondary.\n\nThe transgression-recorded adage states: \"To disbelieve this scripture is to fall into heretical paths, for a heart misaligned with the Dao becomes a heretic.\" It further warns: \"To slander the true scripture is to descend into hell.\" Disbelief merely limits one’s awareness of the scripture’s merits, a minor transgression. Slander, however, abolishes Heaven’s sacred text. The mind commits grave deeds, inviting boundless misfortune and sinking into the darkness of yin, where the sins are inescapable, leading straight to hell’s path. It further states: \"To revile the Emperor and slander the sages, to abolish the abodes of the gods and rend the true scriptures—such unrepentant wickedness incurs eternal karmic bonds, and the calamity extends to seven generations.\" Slander is to malign the sacred text with the mouth, defying Heaven’s majesty, and thus the sin rests upon oneself. To revile the Emperor and rend the scriptures is to persist in evil without remorse, embodying unvirtuousness and leaving an eternal stench. It dishonors the body and shames one’s kin, such that even a hundred generations of filial sons and compassionate descendants cannot undo it.",

      "translated_text": "The sins of one’s own person—when shall they ever end? The transgressions of ancestors and kin—how could they ever be absolved? If not so, then when a state enacts laws to punish the guilty, why are there cases of exterminating three clans or eradicating nine lineages? It is because the crime is so grave that it extends to one’s kin. Thus, though the net of law may stretch wide, there are still those who cast perverse glances upon the scriptures, recite them without reverence, chant them with errors and disdain, or recklessly interpret and judge them, favoring one while disparaging another. According to the severity of their transgressions, there are corresponding retributions awaiting them.\n\nAlas! The Emperor’s scriptures are the law of the present age. To defy the royal law is clearly stipulated in the statutes; to disregard the sacred canon—how could there be no heavenly decrees? How lamentable that the human form is so hard to attain, the supreme Dao so hard to encounter! Parents give birth to us, their toil and suffering the same. Those of virtue bring blessings to their ancestors, just as in this world, passing the imperial examinations and receiving noble titles honors one’s kin. Those of transgression bring calamity to their ancestors, just as in this world, when descendants commit crimes, the household head is held accountable. Though human forms are the same, good and evil differ; though parental kindness is the same, blessings and karma diverge. Why then do people not do good but willingly commit evil, needlessly burdening their ancestors and clans?\n\nThe scriptures’ system of merits and demerits states this clearly: the true scriptures reside in the human heart. When one is purely good, the scriptures’ power naturally manifests. The supremely wise act in accordance with the scriptures without reciting them aloud. Those of middling wisdom perceive the Dao through the scriptures, while the utterly foolish refuse to believe even when told. The supremely wise are rare, and the utterly foolish are not many; the majority are of middling capacity, so the work of teaching and transformation must not be neglected. How can those who study these scriptures fail to embody the Jade Emperor’s compassionate intent to deliver the world, treating them as mere common texts?\n\n*An Examination of the Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture*\nMaster Shi Xinglin says: The *August Scripture* speaks the truth of the Dao, which is inherently present in our nature and thus requires no explanation. Yet people’s capacities vary, and partial views abound. Even the explanations of the immortals cannot fully convey its profound essence; they merely serve as a reference for later generations to reconcile differing interpretations.\n\n*An Examination of the Similarities and Differences in the August Scripture*\nZhang Zifang says: Originally, this scripture had no alternate names or distinctions such as *Highest Numinous Treasure*. Later generations, through arbitrary judgments, added or removed words and phrases, forcing connections in the text and severely distorting its original meaning. Now, upon examination, *Highest Numinous Treasure* derives from the praises of various perfected immortals, but later people mistakenly took it as a separate title. Here, following the definitive judgment of the Mystic Capital, we record and transmit it to the world. Later scholars should bear this in mind, silently embodying its truth. If they encounter errors in transcription, transmission, or exposition, they should collectively verify and correct them. Any extraneous additions to the text or characters are all erroneous. Those of understanding should not cling rigidly to them.\n\n*Preface to the Collected Commentaries and Transmission of the August Scripture*\nYour disciple Zhou Xuanzhen, a humble cultivator of the Dao and successor of the Complete Perfection lineage from Xiaozhao in Shandong, prostrates with utmost reverence, bowing a hundred times in purification, and respectfully submits:\n\nThe Dao is wondrous and non-actional, yet it manifests according to the times; the human heart possesses awareness, and one should accumulate merit wherever one is. Though I, Xuanzhen, am but a lowly being, the least among the three realms, I aspire to return to the mysterious through the wondrous Dharma, merging Confucian conduct with the Dao. Upon glimpsing the Emperor’s scripture, I treasured it more than rare jewels. I studied it word by word, hoping to attain enlightenment through its text. Yet the sacred canon lacked annotations, making comprehension difficult. Thus, I humbly gathered explanations from various sources, compiling the sayings of immortals and sages into the Daoist Canon. For the three fascicles of true text, I arranged them in order; for the five ranks of secret discourses, I assigned chapter titles. The work spans ten fascicles, totaling six hundred pages, comprising one hundred and eight chapters and over one hundred thousand words. The heart-essence of a thousand sages is now clearly visible in these volumes; the profound principles of countless kalpas lie open before the eyes. Though I have not yet fully penetrated the mysteries of the supreme sages, I have at least made the most splendid true texts accessible to all. Having contributed this small effort, I trust that good affinities remain. Choosing an auspicious morning, I reverently carve the text, relying on the support of virtuous patrons to bring it to completion.\n\nI submit this memorial in advance, hoping it may reach the mysterious gaze of the celestial realm, augmenting the pure blessings of ruler and people, and pardoning my humble presumption. May all realms and directions be fully illuminated by the seventeen radiant lights; may all ages, past and present, be molded by the thirty great vows. May all beings ascend to the profound mystery, and may both the living and the dead forever partake in the blessings of the Dharma. If even a fraction of my sincerity is realized, it will be more than enough.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\n*An Examination of the Sequence and Meaning of the Scripture’s Commentaries*\nThe original text of the scripture was sometimes presented as a single fascicle, following its original transmission, symbolizing the Supreme Ultimate. When divided into three fascicles, it symbolizes the Three Powers. The present commentary is arranged in ten fascicles, symbolizing the ten poles, for the Dao’s numbers are fulfilled in ten. The five ranks symbolize the five phases; combining the five phases, four images, and eight trigrams yields seventeen, all divisions of the Supreme Ultimate. Thus, the Emperor’s seventeen radiant lights enable Heaven to generate and Earth to complete. This scripture of the Jade Emperor is Earth’s way of nurturing the myriad things to perfection. The number of Earth is thirty, so the Emperor demonstrates thirty kinds of merit. The Emperor’s virtue surpasses the ten poles, hence his ten titles. Through eons of cultivation, his virtues are boundless. The present commentary’s six hundred pages symbolize the six hundred chapters of the *Fire Records*; its one hundred and eight chapters follow the Emperor’s one thousand eight hundred precepts. Its over one hundred thousand words symbolize the Emperor’s one hundred thousand wondrous acts and mysterious radiance.\n\nAs for the so-called *August Scripture Compendium*, it was compiled for those of lesser capacity who cannot fully grasp the sacred text, summarizing its essentials to instruct them. Knowing this principle, how could there be any conflicting interpretations?\n\n*Precepts on Reading, Reciting, Expounding, and Transmitting the Scriptures*\nWhen reading or reciting any scripture, or when expounding or transmitting it, one should first purify oneself, dress neatly, and arrange one’s countenance with solemnity before placing the scripture on a clean table. Sit upright, compose the mind, forget both good and evil, relinquish all views, and abide in serene emptiness. Only then should one calmly open the scroll—whether to silently read, recite aloud, elucidate, or teach—engaging with the Emperor as if in direct audience, maintaining utmost sincerity without interruption. This is how one upholds the precepts.",

      "translated_text": "**On Copying Scriptures and Precepts**\nWhen copying any scripture, the rules and rituals are the same as for reading or reciting. The mind must be upright, the brush held straight—not for the sake of fine calligraphy, but because this itself is the Dao.\n\n**Distinguishing Variant Scripture Titles**\nAccording to the *Baopuzi*: \"Highest\" (*Gaoshang*) refers to those above the seed-people, who have fulfilled heaven’s utmost limit, their elevation unmatched—what Buddhists call the \"stage of non-retrogression.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor is the most revered among sages, the most noble among spirits. All buddhas, sacred masters, and lords of the myriad heavens thus honor him as the Jade Emperor.\n\nAs Lü Chunyang said: \"The Dao is peerless in its loftiness, hence ‘Emperor.’\"\n\nThe Supreme Lord’s benevolence spans kalpas, his merits surpass all sages, perfectly good and perfectly beautiful—his praises are inexhaustible. Dwelling in the Jade Clarity Heaven, he proclaims the transformations of the Primordial Beginning, and so is titled the Jade Emperor.\n\nHan Xiang said: *The Original Conduct* recounts the Jade Emperor’s foundational path to sagehood, his wondrous practices through eons. *The Collected Scriptures* gathers the five sublime discourses of the Primordial Beginning into one scripture, revealing the true path of cultivation for later generations.\n\nGuangjian said: \"Only heaven is supremely high.\" The heaven where the Jade Emperor dwells borders the Jade Clarity, yet transcends all heavens—hence \"Highest.\" People, seeing the Jade Emperor’s exaltation, assume his virtue is unattainable, never realizing the sagely Dao is undivided: I stand shoulder to shoulder with the utmost sage. The Emperor’s loftiness, his wondrousness, are the fruits of his practice. Thus, the Heavenly Pivot Minister Zhang transmitted this scripture to inspire people to emulate the sage and attain perfection. The imperial decree states: *The Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Collected Scriptures* aims to enlighten readers, enabling them to trace the noble causes of the past and follow the footsteps of the utmost sage, thereby becoming a perfected one.\n\nLater, it is also titled *The Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Treasure Scripture*. \"Supreme\" (*Taishang*) signifies that which is immeasurably great and boundlessly high. It reveals the secrets of precelestial virtue, serving as the origin of all written teachings. \"Cavernous Mysterious\" (*Dongxuan*) denotes its illumination of the Three Luminaries and the manifestation of profound mysteries. The treasury of the mysterious and numinous is the dharma-treasure for countless generations of heaven-dwellers and humans—hence \"Treasure\" (*Lingbao*). In essence, scriptures elucidate the Dao, and the Dao resides within oneself. If one can fully realize their nature and destiny, awakening to this Dao, and practice it with wholehearted devotion, they may enter sagehood.\n\n**On Believing in Scriptures and Discerning the Rise and Fall of Virtuous Karma**\nHumans originate from the Supreme Ultimate. Heaven and hell are described in detail in the scriptures, yet the world remains skeptical—how could this be mere fabrication? Though death returns one to emptiness, those whose destinies are not exhausted possess souls bound by karmic deeds. Bo You became a malevolent spirit, and Zichan believed it; Confucius did not dismiss it. How could there be no hell? Those who purify themselves and return to the transformations of the old creation may ascend to heaven. Yet blessings cannot be seized by chance, nor can karma be evaded by luck. Heaven and hell are created by the human heart. To merely believe in their names without cultivating virtue is to invite disaster. Even if one speaks daily of karmic retribution, what benefit is there?\n\nWhen reciting scriptures, there are purificatory incantations for the mind and the like, but they are not recorded here. Since earlier instructions taught that the mind should unite with the Dao, reciting with sincerity is itself the true incantation—thus their texts are not included.\n\nThe original version of *The Imperial Scripture* begins with the thirty-six sacred titles, corresponding to the thirty-six heavens. Why does the present scripture only include ten proclamations? The ten titles align with the ten supreme attributes of the Emperor’s appellation, not chosen for brevity or complexity. Readers should consider this carefully.\n\n**Commentary on the *Highest Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Collected Scriptures***\nThis commentary is a direct annotation of the *Cavernous Mysterious Treasure Scripture*; later readers should not doubt it.\n\n**Prostrating in Reverence**\nThis scripture expounds the wondrous practices of the Jade Emperor as revealed by the Primordial Beginning. Thus, those who recite it should prostrate themselves in utmost reverence, sincerely offering their devotion.\n\nGazing upward, I invoke the Three Clarities’ realm,\nThe supreme and peerless lords of the Three Realms.\nKnowing the loftiness of the Great Dao and the exaltation of the Three Clarities,\nI aspire with earnest longing,\nReturning body, spirit, and life,\nTo convey my true heart upward.\n\n**Gazing in Reverence**\nI invoke the Jade Clarity, High Clarity, and Supreme Clarity.\nThe Three Clarities’ realms are supremely exalted and peerless.\nThe Jade Clarity’s sacred realm is the Primordial Beginning,\nThe High Clarity’s true realm is the Numinous Treasure,\nThe Supreme Clarity’s immortal realm is the Dao and its Virtue—\nThe Three Realms’ ancestral Great Heavenly Worthies.\n\nGazing upward, I invoke the Great Canopy Heaven,\nThe supreme and mysterious vault of creation.\nLü Chunyang said: The Jade Emperor’s dwelling is the heavenly origin of the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds, forever beyond retrogression. Unmatched in height, it is called the Great Canopy. The Mysterious Vault Lord governs the boundless azure, sovereign of all heavens.\n\nGazing upward, I invoke the Three Clarities’ realms,\nWhere the assembled hosts of perfected beings attend the Celestial Throne.\nZhang Ziyang said: \"Attend\" means to stand in array. The Celestial Throne is the unfathomably profound realm, beyond sight or hearing. \"Hosts\" refers to the multitude. The assembled hosts of perfected beings include the precelestial Nine Celestial Thrones, the postcelestial immortals and sages, all gods, buddhas, bodhisattvas, arhats, and vajras—all are present therein.\n\nThe wondrous Dao is beyond thought and discourse,\nThe utmost and singular vehicle cannot be grasped by mind or speech,\nDifficult to fathom through contemplation.\n\n**Entering to Cultivate the Mysterious Gate**\nZhang Zifang said: \"Entering\" means to progress through true knowledge and practice. The \"Mysterious Gate\" is the gateway of the Dao. The manifold wonders of the mysterious are profound and impenetrable; gradual advancement leads to awakening and entry into the Mysterious. This aligns with Mencius’ \"abiding in stability deepens one’s resources\" and the Buddhist \"progressing through hearing, reflection, and cultivation, ultimately attaining liberation.\"\n\n**The Wondrous Scripture Reveals the Profound Mysteries**\n\"Reveals\" means to uncover, to extract. \"Profound mysteries\" are the unfathomable and obscure. This wondrous scripture extracts the divine mechanisms from the true realm—this is the revelation of profound mysteries.\n\n**Guiding the Deluded in the Dust**\nThe Primordial Beginning expounds the wondrous scripture, revealing profound mysteries to guide those lost in the mundane, delivering them from the sea of suffering and liberating them from karmic destinies.\n\n**Now I Purify My Three Karmas**\n\"I\" refers to the one reciting the scripture. The \"Three Karmas\" are the karmas of body, speech, and mind. \"Purify\" means to devote oneself sincerely and forever sever these karmas.\n\n**Reciting with the Mouth and Upholding with the Heart.**",

Hence it is called the Jade Capital and Golden Gates.*\n\n**The Mystic Garden of Seven Treasures—**\n\nThe White Perfected One states: *The Seven Treasures are: azure jade, jasper terraces, lapis lazuli halls, dragon-veined walls, white jade ramparts, cinnabar gates, and golden radiance suffusing all—thus named the Seven Treasures.* Another account lists them as: glass, crystal, pearls, agate, coral, amber, and giant clam. *The Mystic Garden* refers to the profound and recondite paradise.\n\n**The Jade Emperor’s palaces, ascending the Throne of Luminous Brilliance—**\n\nMaster Zhang Zifang states: *When the Primordial Beginning descended to the Jade Emperor’s hall, he ascended the sacred Throne of Great Luminous Brilliance.*\n\n**With an immeasurable host, he expounded the Dharma-gate of the Numinous Treasure, the Pure and Undivided True One.**\n\nZifang states: *As the Primordial Beginning ascended the throne, boundless perfected sages gathered. Thus it is said: with an immeasurable host, he proclaimed the wondrous, numinous, and precious Dharma—pure, unstained, and utterly true—the secret and marvelous essence of the Undivided True One, seamless and unadulterated, the Dharma-gate of Non-Duality.*\n\nThe *Collected Explanations of the Ten Directions* states: *The primordial spirit of humanity is the origin of nature and life. This is inherent to the Great Heavenly Venerable within the realm of Qingwei Heaven. The Jade Capital and Golden Gates, adorned with the Seven Treasures, are fundamentally possessed by all. The seven treasures of the human body—nature, life, yin, yang, spirit, qi, and essence—correspond to the luminous courts and mystic gardens, uniting heaven and humanity as one. When the Celestial Monarch is at peace, the Throne of the Jade Emperor’s radiance may be ascended. As the hundred constituents obey the command, concentrating the spirit and aligning with the Dao, one attains the Heavenly Venerable’s throne, joining the immeasurable perfected beings in proclaiming the Dharma-gate of the Numinous Treasure, the Pure and Undivided True One. Yet the Dao leaves no trace; only through luminous realization does one enter its secret and wondrous realm—as if upon a great road, with a path of entry. Hence it is called the Dharma-gate.*\n\n**Chapter Two of the Divine Transformations**\n\n**At that time—**\n\n*This refers to the moment when the Primordial Beginning ascended the throne.*\n\n**The Venerable Jade Emperor—**\n\n*Venerable Emperor* denotes his incomparable majesty.\n\n**With the various Celestial Perfected Ones, Flying Celestial Great Sages, Boundless Divine Kings, and jade maidens and numinous youths numbering ninety million, all observing a pure fast and bearing ritual regalia, stood in attendance beside him.**\n\nZifang states: *With* means together; *various* means many. *The Jade Emperor, together with the host of celestial immortals and perfected beings, wondrously assisted in transformation, ascending and delivering through divine power—the Great Sages of the Flying Celestials, the Divine Kings of the three thousand great realms and the boundless heavens beyond, the numinous youths of the Lesser Yang’s mystic qi who respond and attend, and the jade maidens of the Lesser Yin’s mystic qi who proclaim and transmit—altogether ninety million divine beings. Concealing their divine radiance and returning to the primordial origin, they observed a pure fast, held the jeweled regalia, and stood in attendance beside the Primordial Beginning’s Throne of Luminous Brilliance.*\n\nMarshal Tian You, Vice-Commander of the Primordial, states: *The human body possesses a true sovereign, the primordial spirit, whose numinous power is unrestrained. It also harbors Flying Celestial Great Sages, whose spirit and qi guard and support the entire body. In every interstice, there are Boundless Divine Kings, the mystic radiance of the Lesser Yang, and the numinous workings of the Lesser Yin—likewise possessing numinous youths and jade maidens. When the heart aligns with the Dao, the great tally of Yang’s vigor also becomes ninety million, as the body’s spirits pay homage to the origin. A pure fast means an unwavering heart; bearing regalia means the body is free from indolence.*\n\nA humble observation states: *Humanity and heaven-and-earth are of one kind; one should remain clear and unadulterated. When the primordial spirit governs the supreme pole, it is like Master Yan’s heart-fast or a ritualist’s bearing of the banner—singing reverence without duality.

      "translated_text": "At this very convergence, the Jade Emperor, knowing the appointed time was nigh, exercised the power of the Six Penetrations before the assembly, releasing a radiance of great luminosity that suffused all heavens and boundless Brahma-kṣetra. Every realm trembled and quaked; the ten directions and all worlds without limit became as lapis lazuli and crystal, utterly transparent, without obstruction or hindrance.\n\nThe Divine Consort proclaimed: The Jade Emperor, discerning the moment when the mysterious light would unfold and the civil brilliance would commence—the time for expounding the Dharma and transmitting the scriptures—manifested the might of the Six Penetrations before the grand convocation. He emitted a light of supreme illumination, pervading the measureless heavens and the infinite celestial palaces of the divine emperors and perfected beings, all realms of the spirit’s dominion. Every domain shuddered and stirred. The worlds of all immortals and buddhas in the ten directions, without limit, became as precious lapis lazuli and crystal, their brilliance pure and resplendent, revealing all without concealment, leaving no place unseen or obstructed.\n\nMaster Zhang Ziyang said: The Six Penetrations are the penetration of sight, the penetration of hearing, the penetration of spirit-touch, the penetration of spirit-meeting, the penetration of past lives, and the penetration of foreknowledge—these correspond to the six penetrations of the Buddhist tradition, such as the divine eye. *Brahma-kṣetra* refers to the celestial abodes of the divine emperors, wondrous and resplendent in the heavens, untouched by the dust of the world, never decaying, towering and unshakable, invisible to mortal eyes—hence called *Brahma-kṣetra*. \"All realms\" denotes the domains where each spirit dwells. The boundaries of these realms encompass all worlds, not merely the human realm but also the celestial realms. Though lapis lazuli possesses form and light, it reveals all things within; the precious crystal, without flaw or leakage, leaves nothing unseen. The Jade Emperor’s radiance pierces all realms, illuminating even the hidden and obscure—how could there be any obstruction? The comparison is made lest one fail to grasp the meaning.\n\nA humble observation states: The luminosity of human nature is inherently unobstructed, but when the primordial spirit loses its mastery, barriers arise. One may hear but not see, or see but not hear; know but not speak, or speak but not know; obscure self and others, or confuse past and future—thus failing to attain the Six Penetrations. If one thoroughly comprehends nature and destiny, with the primordial spirit ever in command, then the light pervades heaven and humanity, penetrating within and without. The Purple Palace and the Cinnabar Terrace, the Yellow Court and the Mystic Realm—the original abodes of the body’s spirits, inherently celestial—all shine with radiance, unobstructed and fully illumined. Is this not like lapis lazuli and crystal, revealing all without concealment?\n\nYet while the Dao is inherently luminous, attaining clarity is no easy matter. One must not feign ignorance nor be misled by false knowledge. To grasp the truth neither too soon nor too late is a profound awakening. If one can emulate the Jade Emperor, perceiving the appointed time and manifesting light, ever renewing and abiding in constancy, then the great luminosity shall never dim, and the Dao shall forever shine forth.\n\n**Chapter Four of the Divine Transformations**\n\nThe sacred hosts of the ten directions all rode upon five-colored jade wheels, jade-like chariots, azure-green carriages drawn by nine-colored dark dragons, and ten peerless feathered canopies.\n\nThe Thunder Patriarch said: The ten directions are the four cardinal points, the four intermediate directions, and above and below. The sacred hosts are the divine and perfected beings of the ten directions. Beholding the light emitted by the Jade Emperor, they all rode upon wheels of five-hued patterned jade, resplendent chariots of jade-like splendor, azure-green treasure carriages, nine-colored dark dragons of radiant glory, and feathered canopies of unmatched excellence.\n\nBai Yuchan said: The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black. The *wheel* refers to the two wheels of a chariot; the *chariot* is the vehicle itself. The *carriage* is the general term for the imperial conveyance. The nine colors are blue, red, yellow, white, black, purple, azure-green, profound dark, and golden luminosity. The *dark dragon* possesses the semblance of dragon-light but no visible form. The *ten peerless* are those without equal in the ten directions, canopies of phoenix and luan feathers, wondrous and divine. The Daoist scriptures state: The *feathered canopy* is a high-handled feathered fan. Another account says that when the divine emperors and perfected beings travel, auspicious feathered regalia serve as their canopy—this latter explanation is even more sublime.\n\nA humble observation states: Humans, endowed with the primordial numen of the Five Agents—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—each possess dharma treasures. When immortals and perfected beings attain the Dao, these treasures accompany their divine conveyances. If one can silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor, emulating heaven, the spirits within the body gather, and the upright qi manifests its splendor. The jade wheel, the jade-like chariot, the azure-green treasure carriage, the nine-colored dark dragons of spiritual transformation, and the ten peerless feathered canopies—all once resided within the body. How could these be exclusive to the divine beings of heaven and earth? Alas, only those who have truly attained the Dao understand this.\n\n**Chapter Five of the Divine Transformations**\n\nUnicorns danced and phoenixes sang, solemn hymns resounded; divine consorts scattered flowers, golden youths wafted incense, chanting the profound verses of the Cavernous Chapters as they floated through the air.\n\nMaster Xu Jingtian said: As the sacred hosts journeyed, unicorns led the dance and singing phoenixes harmonized, their melodies refined and resonant, their songs clear and bright. Celestial consorts scattered blossoms of jade; attendant golden youths diffused auspicious incense, praising and chanting the sacred verses of the Cavernous Chapters, escorting the divine procession as it soared through the void toward the imperial capital.\n\nA voice from the ten directions proclaimed: When the divine emperor travels, divine youths and jade maidens follow in song, unicorns dance and phoenixes sing, with attendant maidens performing the dance of the unicorn and the song of the phoenix. Hence the saying: \"Their songs resound clearly.\" This interpretation is overly contrived. The unicorns and phoenixes accompanying the divine procession are akin to the imperial mounts of today. Moreover, the Daoist scriptures state: When the Celestial Emperor travels, dragons soar and phoenixes dance—such is the harmony of the celestial realm. It is also said that when dragons and leopards roar in the mountains and forests, their calls resound clearly. These are undoubtedly true unicorns and phoenixes. Otherwise, when Emperor Shun performed music on Mount Qi, why did the phoenixes appear in formation and the hundred beasts dance? Reflecting on the scriptures, one should adhere to the former explanation.",

      "translated_text": "Those of limited insight say: When one cultivates the Dao, silently aligning with the celestial principles, revering the Primordial Sovereign, and embodying supreme harmony within, the celestial pipes resound in song, the subtle meridians settle into tranquility—elegant as the dance of the unicorn, the cry of the simurgh and phoenix, their harmonious calls a joy to hear. The radiance of yang essence shines forth, the splendor of yin blossoms manifests, and one seems to glimpse divine maidens scattering flowers and golden youths wafting incense. The esoteric music and mysterious tones become the celestial hymns of praise sung by immortals, resonating with the primordial spirit. As if riding the wind through empty space, this is akin to the sacred assembly floating through the heavens to the imperial abode. Such potential lies within all, yet only those of resolve may witness its truth.\n\n*Chapter Six of the Divine Powers*\n\nAt that moment, Brahmā Heaven’s assembly of golden immortals, the great bodhisattvas of the Mahāyāna, and the fourfold hosts of the eight divisions—all bathed in this radiant illumination—rode upon golden and azure cloud-borne jade chariots. Clad in ninefold radiant garments, they streamed forth wondrous visions, celebrating the auspicious celestial assembly. The Three Luminaries emitted their fragrance, rare perfumes wafted from the eight directions, and the sacred throng circled and wove before the Dao. A rain of marvelous blossoms descended like clouds, blanketing the gathering.\n\nZifang remarks: At this time, all the Brahmās of the heavens, every awakened golden immortal, the great beings who have realized the Mahāyāna’s true path, the fourfold hosts of celestial spirits, demons, and ghosts, and the eight divisions of devas and dragons—all, illumined by this light, rode upon chariots of jade and gold, borne by flying clouds of golden and azure hues. Adorned in ninefold radiant raiment, they scattered wondrous visions to celebrate the propitious celestial occasion. The fourfold assembly gathered, and the Three Luminaries—sun, moon, and stars—emitted their fragrant splendor. Exotic perfumes drifted from the eight directions, and the sacred multitude presented these esoteric marvels, circling and weaving before the Great Dao. A rain of celestial flowers descended like clouds, covering the grand assembly.\n\nMagū explains: Brahmā Heaven is the most exalted jeweled forest and jade palace, unseen by the mortal world and hidden in ineffable mystery—hence its name. The golden immortals are those whose bodies are indestructible as vajra. The great bodhisattvas include holy beings such as Avalokiteśvara. The fourfold hosts comprise immortals, generals, male and female spirits—or, alternatively, celestial spirits, demons, and ghosts, all of which are valid. To speak of monastics and laity would be incorrect, for such beings rarely ascend to the celestial realms. The eight divisions are the spirit hosts, the general hosts, the deva and celestial soldier hosts, the vajra hosts, the dragon king hosts, the night-luminous handmaid hosts, the asura hosts, and the yakṣa hosts. The nine radiant garments are azure, multicolored, purple, cinnabar, cloud, mist, auspicious light, luminous, and universal treasure radiance. The ninefold mysterious light streams forth these wondrous visions, for they are the radiance of raiment—or rather, the marvelous adornments that follow the form of the spirit, not merely the garments themselves. The *Qingxiao* refers to an auspicious day, or the celebration of an audience with the Divine Empyrean. The four assemblies are the gathering of celestial goodness, the auspicious gathering of spirits, the gathering of timely conjunctions, and the gathering of karmic convergence—not merely the assembly of the fourfold hosts. The circling before the Dao refers to the fragrant wafting from the eight directions, or the sacred multitude’s encircling. The descent like clouds, covering the assembly, describes the marvelous blossoms falling as clouds to blanket the gathering—not merely the sacred throng descending like clouds, which would be overly contrived.\n\nThose of limited insight say: The human body contains myriad spirits, yet if the primordial spirit does not preside, the host of spirits will not manifest their numinosity. Only the true cultivator, silently paying homage to the true sovereign, may summon the myriad spirits to reverent audience. The mysterious light of the spirit palace and the hundred marvels all converge and appear. When the primordial spirit presides over the assembly, auspicious signs array themselves like propitious clouds covering all—then I and the celestial realm are no longer two.\n\n*Chapter Seven of the Divine Powers*\n\nAt that time, the Emperor’s light suffused all heavens, illuminating downward to the ten directions and boundless worlds, making them equal to the realm of the Mysterious Capital. All mortal realms, reaching upward to the Nine Heavens, were connected and intertwined, intimately near. The boundless worlds below—mountains and ridges, slopes and hills, ravines and valleys—all lay as level as the palm of a hand. The six directions were brought near, and the Three Realms were no longer distant. The jeweled terraces and palaces of heaven were scattered like stars among mortals. Rare jades and precious stones were arrayed in brilliance, illuminating the cloud-borne thoroughfares. Seven-jeweled balustrades demarcated the roads. Jade trees and immortal blossoms, resplendent with pearls and treasures, adorned the radiant Cinnabar Field. Lingzhi and sacred grasses spread in lush profusion.\n\nThe Perfected of the Celestial Realms remarks: At that time, the Jade Emperor’s light, from the thirty-six heavens of this world to the heavens of the three thousand great realms, shone downward to illumine all the boundless worlds of the ten directions, making them as luminous as the realm of the Mysterious Capital where the Jade Emperor dwells. All the worlds of the Dharma realms, bathed in this light, were without obstruction, reaching upward to the Nine Heavens of wondrous yang transformation. Heaven and earth, the mortal and celestial realms, were connected in luminous union, intertwined in utmost intimacy. All the boundless worlds below—lofty mountains and ridges, rugged slopes and hills, lowly ravines and valleys—lay as level and smooth as the palm of a hand. The six directions of above and below, the four quarters, were brought into closest proximity, and the Three Pure Realms were no longer distant. The jeweled terraces and palaces of heaven were scattered like stars among the mortal realm. Rare jades and precious stones were arrayed in brilliance, illuminating the cloud-borne thoroughfares. Balustrades of seven treasures marked the roads. Jade trees and immortal blossoms, resplendent with pearls and treasures, adorned the radiant Cinnabar Field. Sacred lingzhi and immortal grasses spread in lush profusion.\n\nShixinglin’s *Examination of Meanings* states: The dwelling of mortal kings is called the imperial capital; the Jade Emperor’s abode surpasses all heavens, unseen by the world—hence it is called the Mysterious Capital. Ordinarily, heaven is pure and earth is turbid; spirits are numinous and mortals are dull. Without connection, they are not intimately near. Yet when the Emperor’s light shines through, the numinous mechanism wondrously links them, so above and below are united, and spirits and mortals draw near. The Nine Heavens refer to the nine upper realms of the thirty-six heavens, not merely nine in number.",
      "overlap_context": "st scriptures state: When the Celestial Emperor travels, dragons soar and phoenixes dance—such is the harmony of the celestial realm. It is also said that when dragons and leopards roar in the mountains and forests, their calls resound clearly. These are undoubtedly true unicorns and phoenixes. Otherwise, when Emperor Shun performed music on Mount Qi, why did the phoenixes appear in formation and the hundred beasts dance? Reflecting on the scriptures, one should adhere to the former explanation.",

      "translated_text": "Mountains refer to those of great height and grandeur. A *ling* is a large mound or hill. A *po* is uneven terrain. A *ban* is the ruggedness of mountain ridges. Deep and long channels are called *gou*. Where mountains flank water is called a *jian*. Where water flows and gathers is called a *xi*. The great hollows of mountains are called *gu*. *Mian* signifies vast and level expanses. Though land naturally possesses mountains, waters, valleys, and ravines—thus being inherently uneven—when the Emperor’s light suffuses and illumines it, wondrous intent overflows, and all the lands of every world become level.\n\n*Qiong* denotes fine stone; *gui*, jade-like gems. *Fenran bingchen* describes their profuse and splendid array. *Yunqu* are the celestial roads at heaven’s summit. Horizontal barriers are called *lan*, vertical ones *shun*—what the world terms railings. *Qian* signifies the radiant brilliance of blossoms. *Zhubao* are the true treasures of pearls and gems. *Dantian* refers to the cinnabar field of the Mysterious Capital’s cinnabar steps.\n\nAs the *Guanshi* observes: The human body contains heaven and earth. When the primal mysteries of yin and yang fail to unite, above and below become distant and estranged. Yet when the original spirit commands the light and celestial radiance blazes forth, earth and heaven harmonize in supreme balance, above and below merge, and all unevenness and curvature become intimately and wondrously conjoined. The treasures innate within the body, when marvelously manifested and spiritually reflected, differ in no way from those of heaven. The *dantian*, the domain where spirit is mastered, reveals extraordinary scenes and luminous visions: numinous *lingzhi* are nurtured, their lush profusion presenting auspicious omens, while railings and balustrades are adorned with immortal blossoms—no need for distant seeking.\n\nIn the *Eighth Chapter on Spiritual Penetrations*, at that time, all below in the lower realms beheld the wondrous music of the celestial spheres resounding from the various heavens, revolving and swirling in harmony with the Emperor’s light, their sounds naturally resonant and harmonious. Again, all saw *luan* birds singing in melodious cries and phoenixes joining in song, their airborne voices attuned to rhythm; dragons frolicking and *lin* beasts circling in dance, soaring and wheeling at heaven’s summit. Precious blossoms from the heavens scattered and drifted down in profusion, covering every road in every realm.\n\nAt that moment, mortals and sages alike were awestruck and amazed; darkness and obscurity dissolved into light. Heavenly beings and mortals rejoiced and exulted, leaping and dancing in jubilation. Ordinary folk and scholars of the Dao all attained flight and ascension, gazing upward at the towering jeweled terraces of kalpas’ height, looking downward upon the purple clouds suffusing the vast expanse of the *Miluo* realm. In all these worlds, every person and people attained the wondrous transformation of the Dao’s *qi*. Those with white hair and wrinkled faces were all transformed and delivered, their locks becoming dark and lustrous, their complexions ruddy and youthful. The young and strong, the tender and small, saw their forms and features enhanced, their appearance radiant and resplendent, smooth and refined in exquisite beauty. All suffering and affliction were healed and pacified. Across the three thousand great worlds, the old and young alike universally awakened to liberation, enjoying peace and bliss, their hearts and minds filled with joy. In every land beneath heaven, songs and hymns celebrated the great peace of the realm.\n\nThe *Celestial Venerable of Longevity* states: When the Emperor’s light pervades all at that time, the people of every world below behold the secret and wondrous music of the celestial spheres in each heaven, revolving and swirling in accord with the Emperor’s light, their sounds naturally resonant and harmonious. Again, all witness auspicious *luan* birds singing in melodious cries and divine phoenixes joining in song, their airborne voices attuned to rhythm; dark dragons dancing in play and auspicious *lin* beasts circling in spirals, soaring and dancing at heaven’s summit. Precious blossoms from the heavens scatter and drift down in profusion, covering every road in every realm.\n\nAt that time, mortals and sages alike were awestruck and amazed; hidden darkness dissolved into light. Heavenly beings and mortals all rejoiced and exulted, leaping and dancing in jubilation. Ignorant mortals and scholars of the Dao all attained divine ascent to the Jade Capital, flying upward to heaven, gazing upward at the towering jeweled terraces of kalpas’ height, looking downward upon the purple clouds suffusing the vast expanse of the *Miluo* realm. In all these worlds, every person and people universally attained the wondrous transformation of the Dao’s *qi*. The aged with white hair and wrinkled faces were all transformed and delivered, their locks becoming dark and lustrous, their complexions ruddy and youthful. The young and strong, the tender and small, saw their forms and features enhanced, their appearance radiant and resplendent, smooth and refined in exquisite beauty. All suffering and affliction were healed and pacified. Across the three thousand great worlds, the old and young alike universally awakened to liberation, enjoying peace and bliss, their hearts and minds filled with joy. In every land beneath heaven, songs and hymns celebrated the great peace of the realm.\n\nThe *Thunder Gate Messenger* states: The wondrous music of the celestial spheres takes gold as the chief of the eight sounds. The primordial tones of the supreme *Brahmā* realm are the indestructible essence of gold. All tones harmonize without discord or corruption—this is the origin of musical harmony. Some say that it is naturally balanced without need for tuning, a sound rarely heard in the world, hence it is called the music of the celestial spheres. Others say that the great creation is the vast *hongjun*, and the wondrous workings of the Dao’s transformation naturally embody supreme harmony; the marvel of celestial music is the transformation of great creation, hence it is called the music of the celestial spheres. *Yongyue huanxin* describes leaping and dancing for joy, hands and feet moving in delight. Eight *chi* make a *ren*. The jeweled terraces of heaven endure through countless kalpas without decay or destruction, hence they are called *jieren*. *Yangguan* means to raise one’s gaze; *fumian* means to lower one’s glance. *Ziyun Milo* refers to the precious realm of the Yellow and the Old, not merely the terraces below—thus there is a sense of both upward and downward contemplation.\n\n*Gan* is a deep blue with a reddish hue; *ganfa* refers to what is now called \"green locks.\" As the *Guanshi* observes: Humans possess yin and yang, their bodies divided into upper and lower. The *qi* above is always pure, while the *qi* below is always turbid. Only when *qi* intermingles without harmony do the upper and the wondrous become unseen and unheard, leading to decline, weakness, and depletion. Yet when one aligns with the great Dao, unites with the primal mystery, and radiates wondrous light, one truly hears the secret sounds and truly sees the mysterious transformations: the elegant strains of the celestial spheres, the *lin* and phoenix, dragon and *luan*, all manifesting their marvels. Auspicious blossoms drift and scatter, suffusing all with beauty; yin and yang’s *qi* bears fine fragrance, and the spirit is stirred in awe. All hidden recesses become luminous, above and below harmonize and flow freely—this is the leaping and dancing joy of heaven and humanity. When yin dissolves and wondrous intent ascends to the mysterious, even ordinary folk and scholars of the Dao ascend. Gazing upward at the azure-jeweled terraces, looking downward upon the pervasively mysterious realm, the land is prosperous and the people at peace, *qi* harmonious and spirit serene. The aged become strong, the pacified attain supreme balance, the deficient become abundant, sinews are renewed and marrow transformed, and one perpetually preserves supreme harmony, the body in perfect accord, delighting in this wondrous transformation.",

karmic debts forever dissolved.\nThen, by the power of the Jade Emperor’s mysterious auspice,\nthe illumination of the Dao’s light,\nall sin-laden multitudes are reborn in the great celestial palaces\nbeyond the ten directions, above the ethereal clouds, in the boundless void.\n\n**My humble observation:**\nNothing quickens the ten thousand things like the wind.\nThe Emperor’s transformation is profoundly subtle, its spirit inexhaustible,\npervading the entire dharma-realm.\nThose who receive it remain unaware—hence it is called the *divine wind*.\n*Qi* may manifest in colors, yet it has no fixed form—\nhow then can one speak of \"raising the essence\"?\nWhere *qi* flows, the Emperor’s virtue operates in silence,\nsupreme harmony overflows, saturating and moistening all—\nthus it is called *raising the essence*.\nThe \"quaking of heaven\" does not refer to thunder,\nbut to yang’s virtue flourishing in abundance,\nemerging from *Zhen* to bestow life.\nThe \"splitting of earth\" is not a violent rupture,\nbut the earth’s way rising from humility,\nyin settling and yang reviving,\nrevealing the marvel of nurturing growth.\nNo longer sealed, the earth’s hidden treasures are released—\nhence it is called *splitting*.\n\"Withered bones reviving\" does not mean decayed bones rising again,\nbut those whose hearts have died and forms withered.\nAwakening to the Dao and knowing truth,\nthey return yang and transform their bones—\nimmortals among men, withered bones reborn.\nThe *po* soul dwells in the body, delighting in death,\nfeasting on offerings.\nThose who live without understanding the Dao,\ntainted by worldly dust and defiled by attachments,\nlose their spirit at death, their *hun* dispersing and *po* scattering.\nSome cling stubbornly, others fall into sinful prisons,\ntheir *po* essence dissolving and drifting,\nphantasmal and adrift in karmic suffering—\nthe *flying po* of evil deeds.\n\"Regaining form\" means *hun* and *po* reuniting,\nno longer adrift or submerged,\nfreed from the terrors of sin and all underworld karma.\nFengdu’s iron walls, so rigid and unyielding,\nare all self-imposed barriers of sinful souls.\nThe Emperor’s radiance illumines the profound—\nwith a single gleam, sins vanish.\nThe prisons of eternal night, where no sky or sun is seen,\nthe Nine Dark Realms, all open to light;\nFengdu’s iron walls instantly crumble to dust,\nand the suffering multitudes of hell are reborn in heaven.\nThe torments of the Three Evil Paths are likewise released.\nAt that time, by the grace of this light,\nthe sin-laden multitudes are reborn in the great celestial palaces of the ten directions.\n\nWhat is a human life?\nSpirit complete, form whole, modeled on heaven and earth;\nyin and yang, the Five Phases—\nno aspect of nature is lacking.\nOriginally pervaded by supreme harmony,\npure and unstained,\nyet deluded by worldly enticements,\nmistaking the false for the real,\nclinging to dust and defilement,\ngrasping at illusions,\nonce attachments take hold, they become unbreakable.\nDeception deepens over time, leaving no room for enlightenment.\nJoy, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, fear, and shock—\nsudden terrors strike, the heart lacks constancy,\nrestless and ceaseless.\nSelfish desires torment the mind and burden the body,\nunheeding of warnings—\nthis is the \"sunken corpse and flying *po*,\"\nFengdu’s iron walls, the dark prison’s confinement.\nYet if one severs desire and forgets the self,\nletting the celestial ruler remain at peace,\nsupreme harmony becomes clear and penetrating,\nstirring the wind of *Xun*, circulating the great harmony,\npreserving the vast and pure,\nharmonizing the Dao’s pulse—\nthen the divine wind spreads far and wide,\nthe myriad *qi* raise the essence,\nyang bestows and yin receives,\ntheir interaction restores yang,\ndissolving boundless suffering,\neradicating endless dust,\nshattering eons of delusion and attachment,\nfreeing one from the karmic paths of darkness.\nThus heaven quakes and earth splits,\nwithered bones revive,\nsunken corpses and flying *po* regain their forms,\nFengdu’s iron walls and the Nine Dark Realms instantly collapse.\nYin dissolves and yang grows,\ndesire fades and principle returns,\nthe turbid is transformed into the pure,\nessence and *qi* refine into

Purple Palace.\nThus the suffering souls of hell are transformed and reborn in the heavens,\nthe torments of the Three Evil Paths are all at once released,\nand the sin-laden multitudes, by the power of this light,\nare reborn in the celestial palaces.\nThose born into this world—ponder this, treasure this.\n\n**Tenth Manifestation of Spirit-Power**\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor divided his body, pervading all the great celestial palaces, causing each to naturally manifest: white jade became their capitals, yellow gold their towers, with seven-jeweled numinous gardens and Great Radiance Halls, radiant thrones, banners, canopies, and parasols, rare treasures and wondrous flowers spread throughout. Then the Jade Emperor, with his divided body, filled all these places—within the white jade capitals, the yellow gold towers, the seven-jeweled numinous gardens, and the Great Radiance Halls upon their radiant thrones—universally expounding the pure and liberating Dao to the ten directions.\n\nMaster Zhongli Quan said:\nWhen that great radiance was released,\nthe Jade Emperor divided his dharma-body,\npervading all the great celestial palaces,\ncausing each to naturally manifest.\nWhite jade capitals, yellow gold towers,\nseven-jeweled adornments in the numinous gardens—\nall were like the Jade Emperor’s own abode.",

      "translated_text": "The Great Radiance Mysterious Hall was fully arrayed with the Great Radiance Precious Throne, the Mysterious Banner of the Dao, ritual pennants, floral canopies, rare and wondrous treasures, and exquisite celestial flowers, spread throughout all the great celestial palaces. At that time, the Jade Emperor, with his wondrously divided body, pervaded each of the great celestial palaces, spiritually transforming the Jade Capital, Golden Towers, and Mysterious Gardens. Ascending the Great Radiance Hall, he mounted the Radiance Throne, where every divine seat shone with light. The Dharma Throne of the Primordial Jade Emperor radiated a light most wondrous, so vast it could not be measured, so divine it could not be described—surpassing even the Dharma King’s throne of the Buddha’s realm. Thus, the Emperor’s transformed bodies ascended these thrones, universally expounding to the ten directions the true, pure, and utterly pristine Dao of awakening and liberation. To expound is to illuminate and clarify its meaning.\n\nMaster Guan’s Humble Insight says: The primordial spirit of humans is numinous and unconfined, reaching everywhere without obstruction, fundamentally identical to the Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformations. The Purple Palace and Cinnabar Terrace are inherently no different from the celestial divine palaces; auspicious mushrooms and divine medicines are no different from the treasures and flowers of heaven. Yet people, ensnared by worldly profit, lose mastery of their primordial spirit, and so cannot circulate freely or penetrate all things, nor manifest numinous power at every turn. They forfeit their true purity and fail to attain the Dao of liberation. If one preserves truth and harmonizes with the Dao, silently revering the Spirit King, then numinous movement becomes universal, filling the entire body—just as the Jade Emperor’s divided bodies pervade all celestial palaces. The mortal form attains the wondrous, rare treasures manifest marvels, and pearl towers, jeweled halls, jade palaces, and jasper terraces become the golden and jade capitals and seven-jeweled mysterious gardens of heaven. The divine palace and cinnabar terrace are the Great Radiance Hall and its Radiance Throne. Qi harmonized and pulses flowing, light stirs and rosy clouds rise—these are the banners, pennants, and canopies. The flourishing of divine mushrooms is like the rare flowers of heaven. When the primordial spirit governs and presides over the cinnabar terrace, unfolding the numinous and revealing the mysterious, it is as when the Jade Emperor, with his divided bodies, simultaneously ascends each throne to expound the Dao. Our true nature endures through kalpas unharmed, without duality or admixture, unbound and unobstructed, fundamentally pure and unstained, naturally liberated. Its great luminosity is never dimmed. If one can spiritually govern and unfold the numinous, then the entire body becomes mysteriously transformed. Unconfined by the three thousand worlds, clearly understanding causes and conditions, never deluded about reality, inwardly and outwardly radiant and transparent, penetrating the divine and attaining transformation—this is the Jade Emperor universally expounding, clarifying, and teaching the pure and liberating Dao to all worlds. Those who comprehend may savor this meaning for themselves.\n\nIn the eleventh chapter on the Jade Emperor’s spiritual transformations, each of his manifestations was attended on left and right by immeasurable Celestial Perfected, Great Sages, Wondrously Accomplished Realized Ones, and Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens. These Jade Maidens possessed countenances of exquisite beauty, refined and wondrously unique. Their forms were adorned with celestial treasures rare and divine, their voices clear and penetrating, delighting all who heard them. From their bodies emanated a subtle, wondrous, and naturally liberating fragrance, its fragrance rich and pervasive, filling all the celestial palaces, the most wondrous and blissful pure lands, and every blessed place across all worlds.\n\nThe Queen Mother said: At that time, each of the Jade Emperor’s transformed bodies throughout the celestial palaces was attended on left and right by boundless Celestial Perfected, spiritually potent and transformative Great Sages, Wondrously Accomplished and majestically adorned Realized Ones, numinous and transcendent Immortal Consorts, and Guardian Jade Maidens. These Jade Maidens possessed countenances and forms of exquisite beauty and wondrous uniqueness, dignified, splendid, and radiant, surpassing all others in divine marvel. Their bodies were adorned with celestial treasures rare and divine, their speech and voices clear and resonant, delighting all who heard them. From their persons emanated a profound, subtle, and divinely wondrous fragrance of great liberation and natural purity, its fragrance rich and pervasive, filling all celestial palaces, the most divinely blissful pure lands, and every blessed gathering across all worlds.\n\nThe Exegesis says: The Wondrously Accomplished are those in whom all virtues arise without forced effort, their merit and power inexhaustible, naturally perfected as Realized Ones. Their spiritual powers are immeasurable, hence they are called Wondrously Accomplished. The Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens are deities transformed from the wondrous qi of the Yin and Brahman, guarding and serving the Perfected Emperor. All celestial maidens are so named. Free from desire and encumbrance, they differ from demonic women. Their virtue and merit complete, noble, beautiful, and revered, they remain purely unsullied and unadulterated—hence they are called Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens, not referring solely to the Empress. These Jade Maidens are as described: their countenances exquisitely beautiful—*shu* means beauty; *duan*, dignified and upright; *li*, splendid and radiant; *qi*, divinely wondrous and rare; *te*, surpassing all beauty, unmatched in the world. Their forms adorned with celestial treasures—celestial consorts, transformed by divine light and spiritual power, adorned with wondrous treasures, their bodies and countenances unseen in the mortal realm. Their voices clear and resonant—*yan* refers to speech, *yin* to sound.",

      "translated_text": "Clear—voices and words distinct. Penetrating—pervading and universally heard.\n\nThe subtle and wondrous, liberated and spontaneous fragrance: the consorts, having attained profound awakening and great liberation, their mysterious mechanism unfathomable, their divine wonder immeasurable, require no artificial crafting—naturally exuding a fragrant aroma. Yet none know whence this fragrance arises, hence it is called subtle and wondrous. This scent is rich and pervasive—*fen* denotes the diffusion of a fine and beautiful aroma; *fu*, the dense and luxuriant fragrance that clings and lingers.\n\nPervading all heavens and the most wondrous Pure Lands—*zhou* means to reach all; *bian*, to extend broadly; *ji*, utmost. In each of the great celestial palaces, the Jade Maidens who attend and guard the transformed emanations of the Jade Emperor—this fragrance does not linger in one place alone but suffuses every world and all heavens, the most wondrous lands free from suffering. The great earth encompasses all worlds of mountains and rivers. Blessed realms—where worlds exist, there is generation and transformation, hence they are called blessed realms. Alternatively, it is said that only through reverence, sincerity, and faith may one perceive this rare fragrance. In every world touched by the Jade Emperor’s light, all beings awaken faith and encounter the wondrous scent of the Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens, hence they are called blessed realms. This interpretation also holds.\n\nAll sentient beings of the Six Paths who perceive this fragrance universally receive deliverance. These are the heavenly path, human path, demonic path, hell path, hungry ghost path, and animal path. Among the heavenly path, all celestial beings who can perceive this fragrance will have the Five Decays and Four Signs forever dissolved, their heavenly blessings ever-increasing. Among the human path, kings, ministers, and the multitudes who can perceive this fragrance will attain the joys of long life in the human and heavenly realms; should their bodies pass away, they will achieve the Way of liberation through *shijie*—the shedding of the mortal husk. Among the demonic path, all demons who can perceive this fragrance will dwell peacefully in celestial palaces, their struggles and battles at rest. Among the hell path, all sinful souls who can perceive this fragrance will escape the torments of hell and attain the bliss of Pure Lands. Among the hungry ghost path, all hungry ghosts who can perceive this fragrance will be sated, free from the torments of hunger and thirst. Among the animal path, all beasts who can perceive this fragrance will escape the sufferings of the animal realm and attain the joy of wisdom.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering states: All sentient beings within the Six Paths who perceive the spontaneous fragrance of the Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens universally receive the grace of transformation and deliverance. The beings of the Six Paths—namely, the celestial beings of all heavens, the human and heavenly beings of all worlds, the demons of all demonic paths, the sinful souls of the hell path, the destitute spirits of the hungry ghost path, and the karmically bound beasts of the animal path—if any among the celestial beings of the four kinds of heavenly realms can perceive the spontaneous fragrance of the Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens, the sufferings of the Five Decays and Four Signs will be forever eradicated, and their heavenly blessings will increase. Among all the human realms of the great earth, if emperors, ministers, and the multitudes can perceive this spontaneous fragrance, they will retain their forms and abide in the world, enjoying the long life of humans and heavens. Should their bodies pass into extinction, they will achieve the Way of *shijie*—unfettered liberation through the shedding of the mortal husk. Among all the heavens and demonic paths of the worlds, if any among the demon kings, demon folk, demon women, or demonic spirits can perceive this spontaneous fragrance, they will peacefully dwell in separate celestial palaces, their conflicts and battles at rest. Among all the underworlds and hell paths of the worlds, if any sinful souls can perceive this spontaneous fragrance, they will escape the torments of hell and be reborn in the bliss of Pure Lands. Among all the destitute spirits of the hungry ghost path, if any hungry ghosts can perceive this spontaneous fragrance, they will be filled and sated, free from the torments of hunger and thirst. Among all the karmically bound beasts of the animal path, if any beasts can perceive this spontaneous fragrance, they will escape the sufferings of the animal realm and attain the joy of wisdom and clarity.\n\nThe Perfected Immortal Sa states: The Six Paths are like roads, wherein beings undergo cyclic rebirth across six kinds of destinies, hence they are called the Six Paths. First is the heavenly path: heaven has thirty-six designations. The highest four heavens are called the Seed People, where the immortals of the Nine Mystic Palaces and Seven Treasures reside—what Buddhists call the stage of non-retrogression. Below the Seed People are the Four Revered and Mystic Heavens, which Buddhists call the Four Dhyāna Heavens of Form. Below the Revered and Mystic Heavens are the Four Heavens of Forgotten Images, which Buddhists call the Four Dhyāna Heavens of the Formless Realm. Below the Heavens of Forgotten Images are the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm. Below the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm are the six heavens of the Desire Realm. Each world contains thirty-six heavens, and all worlds are alike.\n\nThe four heavens of the Seed People are realms of wondrous emptiness and subtle existence, where divine transformations and mysterious spirits abide eternally without decay. Only the highest perfected immortals dwell there, with no celestial beings—thus they are not counted among the paths of celestial beings. The Four Revered and Mystic Heavens are realms where worldly defilements have only just been purified, their transformations still incomplete and not yet divine, not yet attaining the Great Vehicle. Though they surpass the human path, even they cannot escape the great kalpas. There are the Formless Realm, the Form Realm, and the Desire Realm. The celestial beings of these heavens are tall and majestic, their forms like gleaming silver. They do not rely on the illumination of the sun and moon, for they possess their own radiance. The celestial beings of the Sun and Moon Heaven stand five *li* tall, with their height increasing progressively to hundreds of *yojanas*—a *yojana* being forty *li*. The Daoist scriptures say: a *yushe* is a measure of distance. They wear celestial robes weighing six *zhu* and two *qian* and five *fen*. Their heads bear natural pearl crowns. Their eyes do not blink, their heads do not bow, they stand without leaning, their eyes shed no tears, and their bodies know no weariness. Yet if they do not awaken to the Great Vehicle, when their heavenly blessings are exhausted, their pearl crowns shatter, their eyes blink and shed tears, their bodies stoop and grow weary—then the Five Decays and Four Unlovely Signs appear.",

      "translated_text": "If one receives the fragrance of nature with utmost sincerity and reverence, awakening to the wondrous origin of this scent, one suddenly realizes the Great Dao—without relying on external teachings to perceive this fragrance—and thus attains enlightenment. This is called \"the power to perceive.\" The Five Decays and Four Unlovely Signs are forever dispelled.\n\n\"Forever\" means \"eternal.\" Eternally freed from the suffering of decay, one’s heavenly blessings instead increase. With each turn, blessings grow boundlessly, never diminishing.\n\nThe paths of humanity differ: there are yin and yang, old and young, noble and base, rich and poor, sages and fools. Without attaining the Great Dao, one’s lifespan is short, death is arduous, and the corpse does not decompose. Across all worlds, whether emperors, ministers, high and low officials, or the countless masses—*zhao* meaning ten million, *shu* meaning multitude—the term *zhaoshu* encompasses all people, emphasizing their vast number. If they receive the natural fragrance and awaken to the Great Dao, perceiving its subtle and wondrous scent, they attain unhindered, long-lived joy in the human or heavenly realms. Even if they pass away, they may secretly shed their mortal form through *shijie* or transcendence: casting off the shell through seated or standing liberation, or seizing another’s body in rebirth. *Shijie* may manifest as apparent death followed by reappearance in the world, with both corpse and spirit departing, or as feigned death leading to ascension.\n\nAmong the demonic paths, their kinds vary. Some, like the *Gusiluo*, contend with the Heavenly Emperor, disrupting celestial order—such as the asuras and rebels. All demonic realms are either fond of war or create illusions and plagues, dwelling in constant unrest. If these demons perceive the natural wondrous fragrance and awaken to the true Dao, they turn from evil to righteousness, their dwellings become peaceful, and they remain in their proper stations. In the heavens, they occupy separate domains, no longer delighting in strife, conflict, or the suffering of war. Each finds respite and rest.\n\nThe suffering of battle arises from conflict, which brings injury, and war, which brings slaughter—victory and defeat alternate, enemies become foes. Thus, it is called suffering. Each attains rest, for though spirits do not invade demons, demons disturb them, and one must respond by subduing them. Now, having perceived the fragrance and awakened to the wondrous, demons dwell in peace without contention, and spirits are likewise undisturbed. Thus, both spirits and demons find rest.\n\nIn all worlds, hells bear many names: Fengdu, Blood Lake, Blood Gorge, Icy Hell, Fire Chariot, Knife Mountain, Sword Tree, River of Desire, Mind-Restraint, Iron Bed, Wind Blades, Iron Dogs, Bronze Serpents, Cauldrons of Boiling Oil, Sawing, Grinding, Flaying, Naraka, Tongue-Pulling, and the Thirty-Six Hells. All souls enduring punishment find it difficult to escape the suffering of hell’s imprisonment. Yet if they perceive this natural fragrance, they awaken and transcend, leaving behind the torments of hell to be reborn in a pure and blissful land.\n\nHungry ghosts, bound for kalpas in the ghostly register, may have slender necks and bloated bellies, or massive heads and emaciated frames; their throats may be blocked, or they may consume burning coals and smoke, molten copper, or iron pellets. For generations, they never taste water or food, enduring hunger, thirst, and pain, their suffering ceaseless. Yet if all hungry ghosts in these worlds perceive this natural fragrance and awaken to the Dao, the flavor of the Dao fills their bellies, sating their hunger and quenching their thirst. Their throats open, and the torment of starvation vanishes forever.\n\nIn the animal realm, all creatures born from eggs, moisture, or transformation—whether soft or wriggling—are included, not merely birds and beasts. Though nurtured within heaven and earth, animals lack wisdom and endure much suffering, from which escape is difficult. If all animals across the worlds perceive the natural wondrous fragrance and awaken to the Dao, they attain liberation, their karmic retribution ends, and they escape the suffering of the animal realm, gaining the joy of wisdom and understanding.\n\nAnimals are not without awareness, yet they cannot speak of the Dao or embody it; their forms differ, and their spirits are distinct. Some are domesticated for riding or labor, others hunted and slaughtered, trapped in pits, or butchered for kitchens—consuming fur and blood, their flesh and bones utterly devoured. Their suffering is beyond words. Yet upon perceiving the fragrance, they gain wisdom, for this is the power of the Emperor’s light.\n\nA humble observation: the two preceding passages share a single intent. The original spirit of the human body governs yin and yang; true sages, wondrous practices, and divine maidens all arise from it. Within the harmony of spirit, qi, essence, and blood, the subtle fragrance of liberation exists naturally—profound and ineffable. The balance or imbalance of qi, unless one is mad or foolish, also pertains to the Six Paths. If the Heavenly Lord is not at peace, one is bound by the Five Agents; if thoughts are not severed, one is disturbed by the ceaseless tumult of yin and yang. Thus, one is also subject to the turning of the Six Paths. Perceiving the beauty of the Six Ding Jade Maidens within oneself, smelling the natural fragrance of harmony and liberation, and illuminating the Great Dao—so that the original spirit ever shines—one beholds the Emperor’s light and attains transcendence. Forever freed from the dust of the mundane, unbound by the body, one is thus eternally released from the suffering of the Six Paths. Those who understand will savor this and grasp the meaning of these two passages.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Divine Powers**\n\nAt that time, the multitudes of beings born into the celestial heavens as retribution for their sins, having attained rebirth in these sublime celestial palaces, by virtue of the compassionate light’s embrace, awakened and each clearly understood the causes of sin and blessing. Together with their retinues, they performed celestial music, their melodies harmonious and resonant. Some texts render *ji* as \"art,\" while others use the character *ji*. Pronounced *zhīqiè* or *qújì*, it means \"with.\" The character *ji* is correct. Joyfully, they came before the Emperor.",

      "translated_text": "These multitudes, each harboring sorrow, together raised their voices and said: \"We, your servants, have passed through countless kalpas, great and small, never beholding the Three Lights of sun, moon, and stars, ever dwelling in darkness and gloom. Cast into the Three Evil Paths of hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts, we have endured much suffering and affliction. By Your boundless grace, O Supreme Emperor, You extended Your skillful means and radiated Your compassionate light, taking pity and delivering us, so that we might all be reborn in the heavens. All our evil karmic retributions have been utterly extinguished, with no bonds or entanglements remaining. We have all attained rebirth in the celestial realms, gazing up in reverence to the Jade Emperor, each arriving before the primordial and most venerable Dao.\n\nWhen these reborn celestial multitudes of sinful beings had finished speaking, they bowed their heads and returned to their original positions.\n\nMaster Ge the Immortal states: When the time comes for the transformation through fragrant liberation, all the sinful multitudes of hell, hungry ghosts, and other paths who are reborn in the most sublime heavens—having been embraced by the wondrous, spontaneous fragrance—by virtue of the Jade Emperor’s great compassionate light’s embrace, are thus received. *She* (摄) means to guide, uphold, and preserve. *Shou* (受) means to receive and guide the hun and shen, summoning them to return to the true. The Emperor radiates His compassionate light, wondrously transforming true fragrance, embracing all sinful multitudes, who then awaken to the great Dao. *Jue* (觉) means to know the reason why. *Wu* (悟) means thorough comprehension. The sinful multitudes, awakened, escape the destinies of the Three Evil Paths, each clearly and penetratingly understanding the causes of sin and blessing. *Gen* (根) is called *yin* (因, cause). Where there is cause, there is effect. *You lai* (由来) is called *yuan* (缘, condition). Where there is condition, there is karma. Having clearly understood the causes and conditions of sinful karma and blessed virtue, together with their kin and affiliated kindred—*yu* (与) means \"together.\" The sinful multitudes, whether demons, ghosts, or karmic beasts, each have their own kin and affiliated groups—once reborn in heaven and enlightened to the Dao, they join with their kin to perform celestial arts and wondrous music. *Tian ji* (天伎), when interpreted as *yi* (艺, art), signifies that their mastery is all-encompassing. Coming before the Emperor—*yi* (诣) means \"to arrive.\" These reborn celestial multitudes of sinful beings, each containing sorrow within, together raised their voices and said: 'We, your servants, have passed through countless kalpas, great and small, never beholding the Three Lights of sun, moon, and stars, ever dwelling in the dark and gloomy depths, cast into the Three Evil Paths of hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts, enduring much karmic suffering and sorrow. By Your boundless grace, O Supreme Emperor—*fu* (伏) means to bow the body low to the ground; *meng* (蒙) means to receive and be graced by. The phrase *fu meng* expresses the humility of the inferior receiving the favor of the superior. Henceforth, all instances of *fu meng* should be understood thus—we have been graced by Your universally applied skillful means, radiating great light. *Fangbian* (方便) refers to the wondrousness of the Dao, which universally benefits beings, hence called *fangbian*. With the radiance of Your compassionate light, You took pity and delivered us, so that we might all be reborn in the heavens. All our evil karmic retributions have been utterly extinguished, with no bonds or entanglements remaining. We have all attained rebirth in the celestial realms, gazing up in reverence to the Jade Emperor, each arriving before the primordial and most venerable Dao.'\n\nWhen these reborn celestial multitudes of sinful beings had finished speaking, they bowed their heads and returned to their original positions of attendance.\n\nThis humble commentator observes: Humans, endowed with yin and yang, are originally of the same essence as Heaven and Earth. Yet, deluded by profit and desire, they defile their true hearts, persisting in evil without repentance, dismissing the workings of karmic retribution and rebirth as nonexistent. Thus, they fail to recognize the causes and conditions of sin and blessing. The wondrous harmony of true intent is lost, obscured by the snares of worldly dust. Greed, anger, ignorance, and jealousy arise; madness, sorrow, and joy alternate; cravings and the pursuit of fame know no end. They abide in darkness, like the denizens of hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts in the Three Evil Paths, enduring ceaseless torment, suffering as the sinful multitudes do. This is the state of those whose evil karma is not exhausted, who remain bound and unable to be reborn in heaven. When the primordial spirit governs and the light of Heaven shines forth, the yin qi of the body, along with杂念 and evil destinies, are all restored to true qi, ascending to the realm of the Nine Yangs. The threshold between good and evil, the ordinary and the sacred, becomes swift as an echo, with karmic retribution manifestly clear. Thus, the rhythm of Great Harmony is released, revealing the numinous and secret, paying homage to the Primordial Emperor. This is how the sinful multitudes, embraced by the Emperor’s compassionate light, each clearly understand the causes of sin and blessing, joining with their kin to perform celestial arts and music, coming before the Emperor. As yin qi dissipates,杂念 are forgotten, evil destinies are purified, evil is transformed into good, and the spirit and life are returned to the Dao. Through repentance and awakening, they come to know the inauspiciousness of their past evil deeds. Those who fail to awaken to the great Dao are like those facing a wall or sitting at the bottom of a well—truly, they see nothing. Obscured by the paths of duality and multiplicity, they are beset by many fears. Only when the primordial spirit governs the Jade Terrace, descending the true and guiding the numinous, wondrously radiating the mysterious splendor, transforming the yin and completing the field, are they liberated from the dust of the mundane, forever free from entanglements. Their hearts become one with the Dao, silently paying homage to the Emperor. This is how the sinful multitudes, harboring sorrow, spoke of their suffering in the dark kalpas, having been graced by the Emperor’s light, which took pity and delivered them, extinguishing their evil karma, freeing them from bonds, enabling their rebirth, and allowing them to pay homage to the Emperor and arrive before the Dao. This is the most wondrous transformation of the celestial realms. To draw near is to take from one’s own body, for the Dao originally resides within. It urges people to turn inward and practice in reality. Thus, the four lines above—'bowed their heads and returned to their original positions'—require no further elaboration. Those who understand will ponder this deeply.\n\nThe second volume of the *Commentary on the Imperial Scripture* concludes.\nThe third volume of the *Commentary on the Imperial Scripture* begins.",

      "translated_text": "The Fifty-Fifth Celestial Master of the Han Succession, Great Perfected Zhang Guoxiang, collated\nExamined by Retired Scholar Fangwai of Jishui, Jiangxi, Luo Hongxian\nCompiled by Zhou Xuanzhen of Xiaozhaochen, Jinan, Shandong\n*Chapter on Divine Penetrations*, Thirteenth Section\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor emitted a wondrous voice, universally addressing the sacred assemblies of the ten directions: \"All of you, listen carefully. These multitudes of sinful beings, across vast kalpas, have indulged their unenlightened nature, committing the ten evil deeds, polluting the six defilements, and entangling the three karmic actions. Recklessly following their desires, they have never awakened, accumulating hidden sins and manifest transgressions day by day, month by month. Turning their backs on the Dao and deviating from truth, they follow perversity and abandon rectitude. With every thought and intention, they bind themselves to faults and errors. Thus, after the end of their lives, they fall into the three evil destinies, unable to attain liberation. Had they not encountered this Dharma assembly today, by what means could they escape?\n\nThe Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity stated: At the time of luminous embrace, the Jade Emperor emitted a wondrous voice. This wondrous voice is pure, resonant, and radiant, pervading the three thousand great worlds so that all may hear—peerless in its marvel. Hence, it is called the wondrous voice. It universally proclaimed to the celestial emperors, sacred perfected beings, and divine assemblies of the ten directions and all worlds: 'All of you, listen carefully.' *You* refers to *these*. *Listen carefully* means to listen with focused and true attention. The Jade Emperor instructed the sacred assemblies to listen carefully to his teaching, then spoke of these multitudes of sinful beings in the three evil destinies across vast kalpas. *Vast* means boundless and remote. From past kalpas until now, these sinful beings have indulged their unenlightened nature. Though their nature is originally numinous and bright, they give free rein to their desires, acting with madness, confusion, and disorder, following their impulses without returning to their original numinous and awakened essence. Thus, it is called the unenlightened nature. They commit the ten evil karmic obstructions. The *ten evils* are: three bodily evils—killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; three mental evils—greed, hatred, and delusion; and four verbal evils—divisive speech, harsh speech, frivolous speech, and false speech. The accumulation of these ten evils leads to karmic retribution, hence called *evil deeds*. The six defilements thoroughly pollute. The *six defilements* refer to the impurities of the six senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Alternatively, they may be understood as wealth, sensuality, fame, food, sleep, and self-serving desires—these six defilements are also valid. Both inner and outer aspects of the body are tainted by defilements, with no purity remaining; thus, it is called *thorough pollution*. The three karmic actions entangle. The *three karmic actions* are the three poisonous evils of body, speech, and mind. Alternatively, they may refer to past karmic causes, present transgressions, and future karmic consequences—this interpretation is also valid. *Entangle* means to coil, and *bind* means to constrain. Accumulated karma is as heavy as a rope binding a person, preventing liberation; thus, it is called *entanglement*. Recklessly indulging their thoughts without restraint, they act according to their whims, unaware of self-examination, giving free rein to evil without any period of awareness or repentance. Sins unseen and unheard by others, known only to oneself, are *hidden sins*. Transgressions witnessed by all, which cannot be concealed or corrected, are *manifest errors*. Day by day, they accumulate; month by month, they deepen. Turning their backs on the great Dao, they defy truth, follow perverse paths, and abandon the correct Way. With every thought and intention, they lack sincerity and rectitude. Following the impulses of delusion, they bind themselves to faults and errors. Thus, after the end of their lives, they fall into the three evil destinies—hell, hungry ghosts, and animals—unable to awaken or transcend. Had they not encountered this wondrous Dharma assembly today, by what means could they escape their karmic suffering?\n\nI, the foolish one, observe: The spirit and qi of the human body are divided into yin and yang, pure and turbid. Indulging yin tendencies, following turbid and evil impulses, submitting to perverse thoughts, and abandoning true intention—these brew transgressions and make it difficult to escape karmic suffering. The longer evil accumulates, the less one understands the origin of karmic retribution, and thus they remain unawakened. When the original spirit is firmly settled, the wondrous intention spreads forth, the entire body receives its numinous influence, and one silently aligns with the profound mystery. Yang grows while yin diminishes; transgressions are dissolved, and sins are extinguished. Merging with the Dao and uniting with truth—all arises from the great awakening of wondrous enlightenment, recognizing the causes and conditions of faults and sins. The ancients regarded the pursuit of knowledge as the gateway to entry, and indeed, they saw clearly. Moreover, human nature admits no duality; good and evil both arise from the mind. The unenlightened nature is none other than the Dharma-nature. Thus, when it is obscured, one becomes an ordinary being; when it is awakened, one becomes a sage. The distinction between sage and madman is as thin as a hair’s breadth. If one can gather their emotions and return to their nature, stabilize their destiny and refine their spirit, grasp the subtleties of principle and desire, and understand the origin of defilements and evil, they will suddenly transcend karmic suffering, silently align with the profound mystery, and realize the Jade Emperor’s emission of the wondrous voice to proclaim the causes of indulging one’s nature and committing evil to the ten directions. Through encountering the Dharma assembly, beings of karmic types escape the three evil destinies. If one regards the unenlightened nature as a burden and seeks truth apart from it, dividing into two paths, one will fail to unite and attain the wondrous. Scholars should ponder this and naturally understand the essentials of transcending the ordinary.\n\n*Chapter on Divine Penetrations*, Fourteenth Section\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor, in the transformed bodies of the various heavens, employed divine penetrations. Without moving from his place, he transported and received the celestial beings, enabling all to arrive at the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm of the Clear and Subtle Heaven, beneath the assembly of the Primordial Beginning. These multitudes were unaware and unknowing. At that time, the Heavenly Worthy and the assembly beheld the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperors from the ten directions, all gathering before the Heavenly Worthy’s assembly, like an infinite bright mirror reflecting all images, mutually containing and entering one another. Then, the great assembly bowed their heads, gazing reverently upon the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperor—the most venerable among the sacred—deepening their pure faith and increasing their joyful aspiration. Their minds were unwavering, arising in great steadfastness.\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign stated: At the time of the great compassionate light universally embracing and receiving, the Jade Emperors in their transformed bodies within the various celestial palaces employed their great divine penetrations, majestically unmoving. Through the wondrous transport of their embracing and receiving divine light, they moved and guided the celestial beings of the various heavens, enabling all to arrive at the Clear and Subtle Heavenly Palace, the most supreme Jade Clarity Sacred Realm, beneath the assembly of the Primordial Beginning, the Ancestor of the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "The Jade Clarity is incomparably revered, the great, pure, tranquil, and profoundly subtle heaven. The sacred □ realm is where the Most Real presides, the wondrous existence within the Void—where no ordinary spirits may easily arrive, the land of unwavering resolve. Beneath the assembly of the Primordial Beginning, none but the greatly divine and sagely, those of exceptional karmic affinity, may behold and gaze upon it. When the scripture was expounded, all the celestial beings arrived, for the Jade Emperor’s divine and compassionate reception enabled them to reach it. Thus, the great assembly of celestial beings, unaware and unknowing of how they came to be there, were blessed to arrive beneath the assembly of the Primordial Beginning. At this time, the Heavenly Venerable was none other than the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable. Some mistakenly believe these to be the various Heavenly Emperors, but this is not so. At this moment, beneath the assembly of the Primordial Beginning, the entire assembly beheld the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperors from all ten directions universally gathering, arrayed without obstruction before the grand assembly of the Primordial Beginning, like an immeasurable host of great luminous mirrors reflecting the forms and images of all beings, mutually containing and interpenetrating without hindrance, drawn in without omission.\n\nAt this time, the great assembly prostrated themselves, touching their foreheads to the ground in reverence, gazing with joyful admiration upon the divine transformed bodies of the Jade Emperors—the most exalted among the sacred and true. The Jade Emperor is the sagely teacher of all buddhas, the sovereign of the myriad heavens, and thus is called the most venerable. Their pure and sincere faith deepened, their joyful aspiration grew ever more steadfast, their devotion to the Dao and return to the Real unwavering. Only with unchanging resolve is there true sincerity; only with genuine delight in the Great Dao is there true return and offering. The great assembly, overjoyed at beholding the wondrous transformations of the Jade Emperor, were filled with heartfelt reverence, thus their joyful aspiration increased, and they turned wholeheartedly in devotion. Without thoughts of retreat or wavering, they arose in great steadfastness and unwavering faith. A mind that retreats is not steadfast; a mind that wavers is not firm. Without steadfastness and firmness, there is no pure faith or joyful aspiration. Only in gazing upon the Jade Emperor with a mind free from retreat do they arouse the greatest, unchanging, and indestructible true resolve, forever returning to the Great Dao.\n\nI humbly observe: the spirit and qi of humans share a common origin, whether pure or turbid, their wondrous transformations are without duality. If the mind does not align with the Dao, even with guiding and directing, it remains not the true path. Thus, the spirit does not congeal, the numinous is not revealed, and the secret transformations cannot manifest their marvels. If the primordial spirit congeals in truth, wondrously gathering all existence, silently paying homage to the True Emperor and assembling in the mysterious palace, true suchness is naturally at ease, without need for contrivance. This is like the Jade Emperor’s transformed bodies, their divine penetrations unmoving, yet transporting and receiving celestial beings to the assembly beneath the Primordial Beginning in the Clear and Subtle Heaven. When qi and essence mysteriously unite, silently following the Emperor’s decree, unknowing and unaware, the primordial spirit moves with numinosity, illuminating the body’s myriad wonders without constraint or leakage—thus the great assembly, unknowing and unaware, ascends in spirit to the upper realms. The Primordial Beginning and the assembly beheld the gathered transformed bodies of the Emperors, like great luminous mirrors, their radiant lights shining forth, all images mutually containing and interpenetrating.\n\nWhen qi and essence merge with the spirit, returning to the secret and the true, free from defilement and falsity, joy and ease arise naturally. Once attained, it is forever attained, never destroyed nor lost—just as the great assembly, gazing upon the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperor, recognized their supreme venerability, deepened their pure faith, increased their joyful aspiration, and without thoughts of retreat, arose in great steadfastness. Scholars should inwardly embody this to perceive its wonder.\n\nAt the time of the fifteenth chapter on divine penetrations, the celestial beings who had recently ascended to heaven suddenly beheld the Heavenly Venerable’s victorious assembly and the site of the Dao’s practice—the foremost in purity, adorned with the merits of non-action. Overwhelmed with exultation and joy, they all prostrated themselves in reverence, marveling at what they had never before witnessed. At that moment, the transformed Jade Emperors from all ten directions merged into a single body, seated upon the Dharma throne. The pure assembly within the Dharma banquet, wishing to hear of the Jade Emperor’s original practices and realizations, dared not yet inquire.\n\nZhang Guo stated: When the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperor universally gathered, the celestial beings who had recently drawn near to the Emperor’s compassionate light ascended to the Great Mystery and were born in the Clear and Subtle Heaven. Suddenly, they beheld the Jade Emperor, the Great Heavenly Venerable, in the most victorious and beneficial assembly. An assembly is where ordinary people gather to see one another. If the benefits of the gathering are limited, it cannot be called a victorious assembly. When the Primordial Beginning expounded the Jade Scripture and the Jade Emperor manifested his compassionate light, all beings across the Dharma realms universally gathered, and gods, humans, and all beings eternally received great benefit. Opening the flourishing fortune of the Three Teachings, propagating the mysterious essence of the myriad Dharmas—this was the most excellent and finest of Dharma banquets. No assembly across the kalpas could compare, its merits supreme and eternally indestructible, thus it is called a victorious assembly. Within this assembly, the Primordial Beginning praised the virtues of the Jade Emperor and transmitted the Dharma of the Most Real—the supreme vehicle—universally liberating the world to awakening, thus it is called the site of the Dao’s practice.\n\nThis victorious assembly and site of the Dao’s practice were utterly free from worldly defilement, wondrously pure and luminous—the foremost in purity. The Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformations arise naturally, universally bestowing eternal benefit through his mysterious merit, without need for contrivance. The sands of the world receive his grace, eternally bathed in his blessings. The Jade Emperor never acts with intention, nor does the Primordial Beginning act with deliberation. The myriad heavens yield their merits, all buddhas yield their virtues. Through excellent karmic affinity and wondrous assembly, merits and transformations universally manifest—truly adorned with the merits of non-action. The celestial beings, beholding this, were filled with boundless joy, truly not knowing whether to dance with their hands or leap with their feet, so exultant and overjoyed were they. The entire assembly prostrated themselves, touching their foreheads to the ground in reverence, exclaiming that never in all the kalpas had they witnessed such a wondrous, victorious assembly and site of the Dao’s practice.\n\nAt this time, the transformed Jade Emperors from all worlds merged into a single body, seated upon the great luminous Dharma throne. The pure assembly within the Dharma banquet—those called the pure assembly—had ascended by the Emperor’s light, their long-accumulated dust instantly dissolved, utterly free from defilement, thus they were called the pure assembly. The great assembly beheld the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperor manifesting in the various celestial palaces across all worlds, all bathed in radiant light.",

      "translated_text": "At this moment before the Primordial Beginning’s assembly, they once more became a single body—neither did their manifold manifestations reveal any lack, nor did their unity show any excess. In an instant they divided, in an instant they merged, their divine subtlety beyond comprehension, their cause unknown. Possessing such divine penetrations, the assembly all thought as one, desiring to hear the Jade Emperor’s fundamental practices, his cultivation of truth and verification of sagehood, yet none dared presume to pose the question.\n\nI observe: Within the human body, spirit and qi nourish and protect, meridians and vessels interpenetrate, exterior and interior mutually adhere, emptiness and numinous responsiveness intermingle, movement and stillness mutually root one another—originally one part yet manifesting as ten thousand, the ten thousand all returning to a single source. Yet when humans are constrained by qi, obscured by things, ensnared by craving and delusion, then the bright becomes dim, the numinous stagnates. Some may study the Dao to aid the world, yet with petty wisdom and private benevolence, feigning merit and virtue, their kindness and favor finite—how could this be called the Dao? If one begins well but ends poorly, acts well but achieves ill, or forces oneself to sustain partial efforts, straining to grasp a handle, then whether gathering or dispersing, though appearing spiritually efficacious, this is not the subtlety of the Dao.\n\nIf one can truly awaken and comprehend, universally illuminate and penetrate, stillness and response all settled, without the disturbance of grasping or rejecting; if the numinous operates in silent accord, without the labor of forced effort—then the mechanism of the Dao subtly abides. The human heart retreats to listen, the turbid returns to clarity, the stagnant returns to the numinous. Alone, one awakens to true attainment, joyful and at ease, freed from constraints and obscurations, wondrously renewed each day. Thus do the gods and humans of the heavens, upon beholding the Heavenly Worthy’s pure and transcendent Dao-site, its effortless merit and adornments of virtue, leap for joy and prostrate themselves, exclaiming that never before has such a thing been seen. Gathering the ten thousand into one, the Celestial Lord ascends the throne—this is the ten directions’ transformed Jade Emperors once more seated as a single body upon the Dharma throne. If the pure assembly wishes to hear the Emperor’s practices yet dares not ask, then the root cause for expounding the scripture certainly cannot be spoken as one’s own experience. Those who study the Dao must secretly comprehend this, and the wondrous principle will naturally appear.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Divine Penetrations**\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies, saying: In a past age, there was a kingdom named Radiant Severity and Wondrous Joy. Its king was named Pure Virtue. At that time, the king had a queen named Treasure Moonlight. The king had no heir. One day, he reflected thus: *I* or *We*—which should I use? The king said to himself: I must not use *Emperor*. In past kalpas, I have never presumed to call myself *We*. It is proper to use *I*. Now I grow old, yet have no crown prince. If this body should collapse and perish—*bengmo*, meaning death—then to whom shall I entrust the altars of soil and grain and the nine ancestral temples?\n\nHaving thus reflected, he immediately issued an edict, summoning all Daoist assemblies to the various palaces and halls. Following the ritual codes, they hung banners and canopies, purified and adorned the space, and abundantly arrayed offerings. Throughout the six periods of the day, they performed the Dao, circumambulating the halls and praying to the perfected sages. Half a year passed, yet the king did not waver from his initial resolve.\n\nI observe: Human life in this body receives the principle of Heaven and Earth in its nature, the qi of Heaven and Earth in its form, and is born of father’s essence and mother’s blood. It is illumined by the light of sun and moon, sustained by the ruler’s governance and the land’s bounty, preserved by the sagely institutions, and advanced by teachers and friends of prior wisdom. With the Dao, one positions Heaven and Earth, nurtures the myriad beings, enters sagehood and transcends the mundane, unbound by birth and death. Without the Dao, all affairs shatter, one’s stench endures without cease, transgressions accumulate, and retribution continues unending. As a sage, though the body perishes, principle endures, co-eternal with the Dao—thus descendants continue the lineage, and ancestral sacrifices never cease. As a commoner, without heirs, the ancestral sacrifices are cut off. The distinction between sage and commoner is thus vast.",

Awaiting sagehood without doubt, never slackening even for a moment, one lives in accord and dies in peace, returning to the original endowment of creation. The legacy of one’s name after death grows ever more radiant—such was the unyielding resolve of Prince Qi of the Kingdom of Guangyan in cultivating the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Marvels of Spiritual Penetration**\n\nOne night, Queen Baoyueguang dreamed that the Most High Lord of the Dao, accompanied by a host of perfected transcendents, appeared with golden countenances and voices of jade-like purity. They rode a five-colored dragon chariot, surrounded by luminous banners, shaded by canopies of radiant rosy clouds. At that moment, the Most High Lord of the Dao sat serenely in the dragon chariot, cradling an infant. The child’s every pore emitted billions of rays of light, illuminating the palace halls in hues of a hundred treasures. Preceded by ritual standards and floating through the void, they arrived. Overjoyed, the queen reverently received them, prostrating before the Lord of the Dao and addressing him: \"Our king has no heir. I beseech you to grant this child to rule our kingdom. I humbly pray for your compassion and mercy, that you may heed my plea.\" Then the Lord of the Dao replied to the queen: \"I willingly bestow this child upon you.\" The queen bowed in gratitude, receiving the child. Upon awakening, she found herself with child. After a year’s gestation, on the ninth day of the first month in the *bingwu* year, at the hour of noon, she gave birth in the royal palace.\n\nThe August Emperor of Vast Life declared: Prince Qi of the Kingdom of Guangyan never wavered in his resolve. In a single night, Queen Baoyueguang dreamed that the Most High Numinous Treasure Lord of the Great Dao, accompanied by a company of perfected saints, appeared with golden radiance and jade-like purity, their assembly suffused with immaculate divine light. They rode a five-colored dragon chariot, surrounded by resplendent banners, shaded by canopies of luminous rosy clouds. The Most High Lord of the Great Dao sat calmly in the chariot, holding a divine infant. From every pore of the child’s body emanated billions of auspicious rays, illuminating the palace halls in a spectacle of a hundred treasures. Ritual standards led the way as they floated through the void. Seeing the Lord of the Dao cradling the child, the queen rejoiced, receiving them with reverence and prostrating before him. She addressed the Lord of the Dao: \"Our king has no heir. I beseech you to grant this sacred child to rule our kingdom. I humbly pray for your great compassion, that you may take pity on our king’s lack of an heir and grant my request.\" The Lord of the Dao replied: \"I willingly bestow this child upon you.\" The queen bowed in gratitude and received the child. Upon awakening, she found herself with child. After a year’s gestation, on the ninth day of the first month in the *bingwu* year, at the hour of noon, the Jade Emperor was born in the palace of the Kingdom of Guangyan.\n\nI humbly observe: In human birth, with form and substance, there comes the responsibility of human relationships and the mandate of life. The body bears the weight of the fundamental principles, and life carries the duty of dual cultivation. Vast, luminous, spiritually penetrating, and free—this body is no mere vessel, nor is life a trivial matter. It is originally of golden essence and jade-like purity, unstained and immaculate. Yet through ignorance and delusion, one may slight the celestial treasure, failing to unite with the wondrous and divine, to conceive the mysterious and numinous. Thus, one squanders the most precious gift of one’s household, rendering this body useless. Even if one possesses some self-regard, without clarity in the Dao and genuine effort, one may feign goodness while harboring evil—golden without, yet rotten within. Such a person cannot even preserve their own being, let alone manifest the celestial nobility and inherent excellence. How then can one fulfill one’s form and perfect one’s nature, ensuring that one’s true master does not decline?\n\nIf one awakens to the profound root of life and death, grasps the secret essentials of Heaven and humanity, thoroughly understands yin and yang, and deeply comprehends the workings of creation; if one recognizes one’s ancestral lineage, knows one’s parents, sees that one’s birth arises from the earth and one’s origin from Heaven; if one fuses the golden elixir, refines the pure jade, attains the wondrous in the indistinct, and unites with the mysterious in the obscure; if one’s spirit of emptiness and non-being nurtures the true reality of wondrous being, forming the sacred embryo and giving birth to the divine child—then those who gave me life do not do so in vain, and those who nurture me do not do so idly. With sinews of gold and bones of jade, one transcends form and spirit, reviving what was withered and flourishing eternally—just as Queen Baoyueguang dreamed of the Most High Lord of the Dao and the company of perfected transcendents, who bestowed the sacred child upon her to rule the kingdom.\n\nA single person—awakened, one becomes an immortal; unawakened, one perishes. To understand the meaning of Queen Baoyueguang’s prayer for a child is to awaken to the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Marvels of Spiritual Penetration**\n\nAt the moment of his birth, his body radiated a brilliant light that filled the kingdom. His countenance was wondrously fine, and all who beheld him were never sated. As a child, he was keen and wise; as he grew, he was kind and benevolent. Throughout his kingdom, he distributed all the treasures from the royal storehouses to the poor, the destitute, the widowed, the orphaned, the childless, the solitary, the starving, the infirm, and all suffering beings.",

Without the Dao, all affairs shatter, one’s stench endures without cease, transgressions accumulate, and retribution continues unending. As a sage, though the body perishes, principle endures, co-eternal with the Dao—thus descendants continue the lineage, and ancestral sacrifices never cease. As a commoner, without heirs, the ancestral sacrifices are cut off. The distinction between sage and commoner is thus vast.",

      "translated_text": "The prince was benevolent, kind, and yielding; his governance was guided by the Dao, and his songs and odes spread far. The distant lands were transformed by his virtue, and all under heaven looked up to him in admiration, turning to the Benevolent Prince. His father, the king, rejoiced even more.\n\nThe Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: When the Jade Emperor descended to be born, his body radiated a hundred treasures’ brilliance, filling the entire Kingdom of Resplendent Light. His countenance and form were wondrously fine, and all who beheld him never grew weary. In his tender youth, he was keen and wise; as he matured, he was compassionate and virtuous. From all the storehouses and treasuries of his kingdom, he distributed every treasure and possession without restraint, as if scattering them all without hesitation or regret. Yet one might ask: if he were to give away all wealth, would he not forsake his sovereign, his parents, and his kingdom? The Jade Emperor, born with innate wisdom and perfect conduct, would never commit such excess. Let the reader consider this carefully.\n\nThe emperor’s distribution of the treasuries was not to perpetuate wealth and nobility but to aid those without means—the destitute and impoverished, the helpless and distressed, the widowed without husbands, the widows without wives, the fatherless orphans, the childless and solitary, those without mothers or any support, those without fathers or anyone to rely upon; those suffering in years of famine when grain did not ripen, or in times of hardship when even vegetables failed; those afflicted by illness, frailty, injury, or disability—all such suffering beings received the Jade Emperor’s relief and benevolent aid. His kindness arose from utmost sincerity, not mere outward display. His benevolence and compassion, warmth and humility, spread across the land, and all who benefited from his virtue sang his praises in odes and ballads, extolling his Dao. From the royal domains to the distant frontiers, his transformative influence reached the farthest corners. All under heaven gazed upon him in reverence and followed his example, turning to the Benevolent Prince. To \"turn\" is to align with him, as the *Analects* says: \"For one day to master oneself and return to ritual propriety, all under heaven will turn to benevolence.\" Seeking the Dao brings swift and great attainment. The Jade Emperor, born with divine marvels and growing in compassion, how could the world not turn to him in devotion?\n\nThus, as his virtue became manifest, the four quarters rejoiced and submitted. Even in his youth as prince, the signs of sagely and enlightened governance were already evident. Therefore, his father the king not only rejoiced at his birth but, seeing the prince’s Dao today, felt even greater joy and celebration.\n\nI humbly observe: When one is born between heaven and earth, possessing this body, one possesses the true vital qi of life. Only with this true vital qi can one be human. This true qi, when in heaven and earth, is the wondrous principle; when in the human body, it is the vast and unyielding. The true qi is mysterious and numinous, luminous and free, illuminating past and present, pervading the dharma realm. Endowed with this principle, one inherently knows no hardship, suffering, peril, or aversion. Yet when it descends from heaven, it is cast aside by humanity. The true nature of inheriting goodness and perfecting one’s character is treated as a trivial, non-urgent matter. Unable to fully embody the correct principle to nurture the true numen or cultivate the wondrous mechanism to achieve spiritual transformation, one remains obscured and unenlightened, given to anger, jealousy, and immorality; greedy for profit and fame, endlessly hoarding; unmoved by virtue, indifferent to the poor and suffering; arrogant and self-righteous, inviting slander and defamation. Such conduct harms the true qi, weakens the vast and unyielding, and casts oneself into the realm of the ordinary and foolish, unable to enter sagehood.\n\nIf one preserves the Great Harmony, congealing and merging the secret intent, the sacred embryo reveals its treasure light, and the divine infant emits wondrous radiance. Gradually unfolding the mysterious spirit, one achieves effortless spiritual transformation, viewing the mire of power and profit, the dust of honor and glory, as mere illusions. With one’s abundance, one aids others’ lack, relieving people and benefiting beings, extending kindness to all. Though the kalpas rise and fall, one’s merit and virtue remain inexhaustible. One’s盛德 and spiritual transformation become eternally renowned as an immortal, and the boundless kalpas of the dharma realm are all embraced by one’s compassion. Heavenly spirits and humans rejoice, revering and submitting to one’s supreme virtue. Such a one is the heaven-and-earth’s filial child, a rare being in the world, bringing glory and joy to parents. This is the divine marvel of the Jade Emperor’s birth and growth—his compassion and benevolence leading all under heaven to turn to benevolence, and his father the king to rejoice even more.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Marvels of Spiritual Penetration**\n\nAfter this, the king suddenly passed away. The prince, now governing, reflected upon the fleeting nature of life and instructed his ministers to ensure a virtuous succession. He then relinquished his kingdom and retired to the Fragrant and Resplendent Mountain to cultivate the Dao, where he perfected his practice and transcended the mundane.\n\nThe Dipper Mother said: After the Benevolent Prince of the Kingdom of Wondrous Joy had won the hearts of all under heaven, the king suddenly passed away. The prince ascended the throne, governing the kingdom’s affairs, and reflected upon the fleeting nature of life. To \"reflect\" is to look down upon one’s own existence and contemplate it. \"Fleeting life\" refers to human existence in the world, like floating clouds in the sky or duckweed upon the water, impermanent and uncertain—hence \"fleeting.\" The emperor, pondering this, issued decrees to his kingdom’s ministers and officials, entrusting the great treasure of rulership to a worthy successor, ensuring the virtuous continuation of the royal line. Another interpretation suggests he instructed the ministers to inherit the throne and practice virtue, which also makes sense. Having entrusted the throne to a worthy person, he abandoned his kingdom and secluded himself on Fragrant and Resplendent Mountain to cultivate the Great Dao. According to ancient records, Fragrant and Resplendent Mountain is the Stone Mountain in the Eastern Sea. Other mountains where the Jade Emperor left traces of his teachings are not the original site of Fragrant and Resplendent Mountain. After entering the mountain to cultivate the Dao, he completed his practice, transcended the mortal world, and ascended to the heavens to deliver beings.\n\nI humbly observe: Human life in this world is like a white colt passing a gap, like thunder and lightning in the void—suddenly appearing, suddenly vanishing, unable to preserve itself. Even one who is honored as the Son of Heaven, possessing all within the four seas, clad in dragon robes and feasting on delicacies from every land, upon death, all becomes an empty dream. Those of lesser rank, even the highest ministers with fields stretching across a thousand *li*, are not worth mentioning.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, wealth and nobility are rarely shared with kin, while poverty and hardship are common. Yet people remain drunk in life, dreaming in death, deeply deluded and unenlightened. Thus, those who practice the Dao are seldom heard of—how much rarer still are those who become immortals! If one could awaken to the truth that the body is but a temporary lodging, life as fleeting as the mayfly, and suddenly break free from the dusty snares of the world, earnestly seeking the profound mystery, clearly perceiving and steadfastly practicing, without craving swift results, then when the time is ripe, transformation will naturally occur, and one will achieve the rank of immortal. Though one’s ancestors may have passed, they too are preserved by the sacred descendant’s arrival in Luoyang—thus, they do not perish. Was it not Prince Miaole, who relinquished his father’s throne to cultivate the Dao, achieving perfection and transcending the mortal realm?\n\nAlas! Within the human body lies Kunlun Mountain. When old yang is exhausted, a single yang is reborn. Detached from all extremes, one secretly cultivates the utmost truth, and over time, ascends through immortal transformation. The rarity of such an aspiration mirrors the Emperor’s own path—ponder this deeply.\n\n**Chapter Twenty of the Divine Powers:**\nAfter passing through this kalpa, spanning eight hundred kalpas, he frequently relinquished his kingdom for the sake of all beings, severing love to study the Dao. Thereafter, through another eight hundred kalpas, he practiced medicine to heal the sick, rescuing and delivering sentient beings, granting them peace and joy. When this kalpa ended, he passed through yet another eight hundred kalpas, widely performing expedient means, unlocking the treasures of the Daoist canon, expounding sacred scriptures, magnifying the true teachings, proclaiming divine works, aiding the nation and saving the people—from the hidden to the manifest.\n\nAfter this, through another eight hundred kalpas, he sacrificed his body and life, practicing forbearance and relinquishing his own flesh and blood. Through such cultivation over three thousand two hundred kalpas, he first attained the rank of Golden Immortal, known as the Tathāgata of Pure and Natural Enlightenment, teaching bodhisattvas to suddenly awaken to the true essence of the Great Vehicle and gradually enter the wondrous Dao of emptiness.\n\nThrough such cultivation, after another hundred million kalpas, he finally attained the position of Jade Emperor. When these words were spoken, the assembly of pure disciples unanimously exclaimed in wonder, declaring they had never before witnessed such sacred and wondrous conduct.\n\nMaster Xu Zhenjun said: After the Jade Emperor first relinquished his royal throne to cultivate the Dao, passing through these kalpas, he endured eight hundred kalpas as a crown prince. Each time he abandoned his kingdom, it was to deliver all beings—severing the bonds of the six relations to study the true Dao. Kalpas vary in duration: sixty years form a \"dust kalpa,\" five hundred years a \"cycle of flourishing destiny,\" three thousand years a \"leap kalpa\"; eighteen thousand eighty years a \"lesser kalpa,\" one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years a \"wheel-turning kalpa.\" Countless kalpas accumulate to form a great kalpa. Here, \"eight hundred kalpas\" is not confined to size but signifies vast duration—roughly eight hundred kalpas in all.\n\nDuring this time of severing love to study the Dao, after many kalpas, he endured another eight hundred kalpas, administering medicines to treat illnesses, rescuing and aiding suffering beings, granting them health and happiness. When this kalpa ended, he passed through another eight hundred kalpas, widely performing great expedient means, unlocking the scriptures of the Daoist canon, expounding the mysterious and numinous chapters, expanding and magnifying the great orthodox teachings, proclaiming and propagating divine scriptures, assisting the nation and delivering the people—from the hidden to the manifest, from darkness to light, extending blessings throughout heaven, earth, and the human realm.\n\nAfter these kalpas, he endured another eight hundred kalpas, unafraid to sacrifice his body, unconcerned for his life, practicing forbearance and enduring humiliation without resentment. He joyfully relinquished his own flesh and blood—just as one who gives away wealth feels as though parting with their own flesh. In a past kalpa, the Jade Emperor practiced forbearance and relinquishment, giving away his family’s wealth until reduced to poverty and peril. Though insults assailed him and others could not bear the suffering, he remained unmoved, never wavering or regretting. This was truly sacrificing his body and life, practicing forbearance, and relinquishing his flesh and blood.\n\nThe sage endures what others find unbearable to achieve what others cannot. The Emperor’s attainment of supreme sageliness required such sacrifices. Yet, as a sage transforming and delivering the foolish, he could manifest in any form, his true body never truly destroyed. Those who comprehend this spiritually should not cling to the literal words—then they will grasp the truth.\n\nFrom the eight hundred kalpas of severing love to study the Dao, through healing the sick, expounding scriptures to deliver beings, and practicing forbearance and relinquishment—such wondrous and arduous cultivation over three thousand two hundred kalpas finally allowed him to attain the rank of Golden Immortal, achieving the indestructible fruit, known as the Tathāgata of Pure, Natural, and Wondrous Enlightenment, the Dharma King. He taught bodhisattvas and great beings to suddenly awaken to the true essence of the Great Vehicle and gradually enter the profound, empty, and wondrous Dao.\n\nThe term *Tathāgata* signifies that all beings possess inherent nature, replete with myriad virtues. Its coming is equal to that of immortals and buddhas, fundamentally vast and luminous. Those who recklessly abandon it fail to preserve the endowment of heaven, obscuring their original true suchness to the utmost, thus falling into mundane karma. After the Jade Emperor relinquished the throne of Prince Miaole, he endured another three thousand two hundred kalpas, his merit and transformation boundless, never regressing, unattached and unpolluted. As the Dharma King of Great Awakening, he encompassed heaven and earth, perfectly nurturing all beings without excess or omission. Those who fully embody and return to this truth transcend all others—this is the meaning of *Tathāgata*.\n\nThrough such great cultivation over a hundred thousand kalpas, he finally attained the position of Jade Emperor, Lord of the Ten Thousand Heavens. When the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning had finished speaking, the pure assembly unanimously exclaimed in wonder, declaring they had never before witnessed such sacred and wondrous conduct.\n\nI humbly observe: Human life embodies yin and yang, thoughts encompass principle and desire. Yin and yang are mutually rooted, alternately waxing and waning; principle and desire cannot coexist in dominance. When desire stirs, yin congeals; when principle prevails, yang flourishes. Flourishing to the point of transformation, one wondrously enters the divine.",

      "translated_text": "Only what is enacted proves ever fitting; nothing applied is ever amiss. The primordial purity of yang is the highest good—yet how few the indolent who can sustain it.\n\nMoved by this, the Jade Emperor expounded the wondrous meaning in full: relinquishing not one but countless royal thrones, he endured eight hundred kalpas to renounce his kingdom for all beings, severing bonds of love to study the Great Dao—this is the boundless pinnacle of sublime conduct. Moreover, the original spirit governs the numinous terrace, commands the five senses, and directs the hundred ministries. Among the six desires and seven emotions, love is the weightiest. To exhaust desire and restore principle, to gather emotions and return to nature, to strip away all embellishments and unite with the profound mystery—this is the Heavenly Lord’s abandonment of rank to study the Dao.\n\nRefining the elixir to save lives, he granted them peace and joy—thus the Jade Emperor endured another eight hundred kalpas to deliver the world. Mortals, deluded by toil and illusion, carve away their true intent, content to age and die without awakening—this is the world’s gravest affliction. Yet by congealing the three treasures of original spirit, essence, and qi into a secret, numinous fusion, reversing yang to transform the bones, one lives without delusion and dies without perishing—this is the inner vision of refining the elixir to save lives.\n\nExpounding scriptures to aid the nation, benefiting both the hidden and the manifest, the Emperor endured yet another eight hundred kalpas. Mortals who comprehend the profound and penetrate the secret, wondrously transmuting yin and yang, ascend as immortals to succor spirits and beings—this embodies the silent transmission of true scriptures to benefit both the unseen and the seen. Sacrificing life and body, forsaking flesh and blood, the Emperor endured another eight hundred kalpas. Mortals whose hearts remain unmoved, who relinquish their impure forms—this too embodies the resolve to endure humiliation and surrender flesh and blood.\n\nFrom kalpa to kalpa, his reverent cultivation never wavered, pure and unstained, wondrously transforming by nature. Enabling all to awaken, his merit knows no bounds—just as the Jade Emperor, from over three thousand kalpas to a hundred million kalpas, has never ceased such unparalleled wonder.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Divine Powers**\n\nAt that moment, among the assembly stood a Jade Maiden named Night Radiance. Rising from her seat, she adjusted her robes and crown with solemn grace, stepped forward with measured elegance, and knelt long before the Dao. She addressed the Celestial Venerable:\n\n“By what past merit, O Ancient One, did I once gain the fortune to attend in Your presence, personally offering reverent service for a hundred million kalpas? In the Three Clarities’ realm, the Golden Gates and Jade Capital, serene and untroubled, I roam carefree in bliss, wandering the sacred precincts, feasting on the sounds of the Dao, savoring their ineffable flavor. Yet never have I witnessed such a rare and wondrous event.”\n\n*As Master Guiguzi said:* When the pure assembly praised the Jade Emperor, among those in attendance stood a Jade Maiden named Night Radiance. Rising from her seat, she straightened her robes and crown—though already immaculate while seated, her dignity only deepened upon standing. With measured, graceful steps, she knelt long before the Dao Ancestor and addressed the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning: “By what past cause, O Lord, did I, Night Radiance, merit the fortune to gaze upon and attend You in the presence of the Heavenly Emperor? Some suppose Night Radiance refers to one in the Three Clarities’ realm, or inquires about the Jade Emperor’s divine radiance—this is mistaken. The Heavenly Emperor often attends the Three Clarities’ realm; when scriptures are expounded, the Jade Emperor’s great light is not always visible. Thus the Jade Maiden speaks thus, leaving no doubt she is the Heavenly Emperor’s attendant.\n\nNot once but countless times have I served in Your presence, personally offering reverent service for a hundred million kalpas. In the Three Clarities’ mysterious realm, the Golden Gates and Jade Capital, utterly serene and untroubled, I wander carefree in boundless joy, delighting in the sacred precincts, nourishing myself on the sounds of the supreme Dao. As for ‘feasting,’ the sacred tones of the Clear and Subtle Heavenly Perfected contain the highest, most wondrous principles, their flavor inexhaustible and not easily discerned. Though a divine being, I am but newly among the sacred ranks—how could I fully comprehend? Thus I listen to the Dharma’s sounds and savor them deeply, as one savors fine food. This refers to my past experience, not today’s hearing of the Celestial Venerable’s words. To interpret it as today’s hearing would miss the text’s original intent.\n\nNight Radiance has long dwelled in the sacred realm, serving in the Emperor’s presence in boundless joy. Hearing the Dharma’s sounds, she witnesses all wonders, comprehending them all, just as the Jade Emperor universally radiates his compassionate light, manifesting and gathering at will, creating and transforming with auspicious marvels. Through kalpas of cultivation, his merit is immeasurable, teaching and perfecting the sacred ranks, awakening them to the highest truth. Surveying the kalpas, gazing into the distant past, never have I witnessed such a rare and unparalleled event.\n\n*Humbly observed:* The yin within the human body is the immortal maiden. Jade-like bones, icy purity, radiant bearing, and refined demeanor—these are her innate qualities. Yet sullied by worldly dust and defilement, long obscured by grime, the true yin of Brahmanic qi sinks into impure thoughts and evil deeds; the six ding spirits of yin invert into hungry ghosts of impermanence. Endless thoughts churn ceaselessly, day and night restless, eating and sleeping without constancy. Flustered in movement, unable to attend the Supreme Emperor or serve the Mysterious Origin. Indulging in frivolity, craving splendor and finery, bound by fame and profit, burdened by worldly toil, she knows no carefree joy, rising and falling in the wheel of rebirth, endlessly descending into the mortal world. Unaware of the Dao’s wondrous Dharma, she daily indulges in passions and desires, stirred by demonic hordes, obstructed from wondrous transformations, making such encounters rare indeed.\n\nYet when the pure yang secretly transmutes, hatching the yin essence; when the luminous moon reveals its wondrous radiance without end, and the jade-like form displays its divine transformations without exhaustion; when all within the body becomes utterly numinous, the mechanism of transformation moves with ease, its wondrous mysteries revealed in crystalline clarity—then, in stillness, she pays homage to the Celestial Venerable and silently attends the Heavenly Emperor. Her nature and Dao remain ever luminous, and the human heart obeys her command.”",
      "overlap_context": "d speaking, the pure assembly unanimously exclaimed in wonder, declaring they had never before witnessed such sacred and wondrous conduct.\n\nI humbly observe: Human life embodies yin and yang, thoughts encompass principle and desire. Yin and yang are mutually rooted, alternately waxing and waning; principle and desire cannot coexist in dominance. When desire stirs, yin congeals; when principle prevails, yang flourishes. Flourishing to the point of transformation, one wondrously enters the divine.",

      "translated_text": "Within the realm of the Cinnabar Terrace and the Purple Palace, amid palaces of seven treasures and five luminances, all is serene, empty, and radiant—spacious, carefree, and blissful. The spirit roams the mysterious realm, the ears savor the sound of jade-like resonance. This is a rare spectacle of the world, a supreme event never before witnessed.\n\nThen the Moonlight Jade Maiden rose from her seat, adjusted her robes and headdress, and with graceful steps knelt before the Dao. She addressed the Heavenly Venerable, inquired about past causes, and entreated him to clarify the wondrous and rare transformations of the Jade Emperor.\n\nNow, the principles of yin and yang and the regulation of qi are common to all people. Those who attain the Dao employ the yin mechanism to manifest the divine powers of the Jade Maiden; those who do not revert to karmic destinies. Thus, the matter of cultivating the true cannot but be made clear.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two on Divine Powers**\n\nYet I do not understand: in the radiant light seen earlier, the ten directions of all heavens manifested sacred realms, wherein the responsive and transformative Dharma-bodies of the Jade Emperor appeared, attended by Heavenly Perfected Great Sages, Wondrous Practice Perfected Ones, and Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens. These Jade Maidens possessed dignified and majestic countenances, exquisitely beautiful forms, and emitted wondrous fragrances unmatched by any. By the Jade Emperor’s divine power of wondrous translocation, they have now all gathered in the Heaven of Pure Tenuity.\n\nI do not know by what karmic conditions this Jade Maiden has attained such a supreme physical form. I humbly beseech the sagely compassion to reveal what I have yet to comprehend.\n\nThe Lord of Southern Florescence said: The Moonlight Jade Maiden herself has declared that though she has long dwelled in the heavens and listened to profound discourses, she has never before witnessed the Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformations. Yet today, she speaks of the great radiant light that manifested the ten directions of all heavens, revealing sacred and true realms. (The character *bian* may also be read as *traverse*, and the meaning remains coherent.) Within these realms, the responsive and transformative Dharma-bodies of the Jade Emperor appeared, attended by the divine and immortal Perfected Great Sages of all heavens, Wondrous Practice Perfected Ones, and Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens as guardians and protectors.\n\nThese Jade Maidens possess dignified and majestic countenances, exquisitely beautiful and wondrous forms, and emit divine and marvelous fragrances unmatched by any. By the Jade Emperor’s great divine power of wondrous translocation and compassionate reception, all the attendants followed the Emperor’s light and have now universally gathered in the Heaven of Pure Tenuity.\n\nI do not know by what wondrous causes and excellent conditions these attendant Jade Maidens have attained such a supreme physical form. A *supreme physical form* refers to the wondrously transformed body of the Jade Maiden, which surpasses all and admits no comparison.\n\nNow, the world comprises six destinies: the three evil destinies of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals, which possess no beauty. The human body is but an aggregation of essence and blood; when qi scatters and spirit departs, its filth is indescribable. Moreover, in life, there is decline, old age, sickness, and suffering—thus, all beauty is but a dream’s illusion. Therefore, the body is called *illusory* and cannot be termed a *supreme physical form*. Beyond this, in the demonic destiny, all demonic maidens, though possessing extraordinary beauty, the five supernatural powers, and the ability to transform, ultimately bring calamity upon themselves when their karmic retribution matures. How then can they be called *supreme physical forms*?\n\nOnly these Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens possess peerless countenances and surpassing demeanor, transcending the Three Realms. Their celestial fragrance and wondrous transformations neither decline nor remain ordinary—such sights are unattainable in the mortal world. This is the *supreme physical form*, the nature of which even the Moonlight Jade Maiden cannot fathom.\n\nI humbly beseech the utmost sagely compassion to reveal the meaning of what I have yet to comprehend, that the Moonlight Jade Maiden may understand the principles behind the dignified beauty, wondrous fragrance, and exquisite forms of the Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens.\n\nIn my humble opinion: the blessings and karma of the world are all created by the mind. The mind governs nature and emotions; nature encompasses all. The wondrous transformations of yin and yang are inherently possessed by all. Without cultivating the Dao, one remains with yin as a dark destiny, a rotting corpse, the root of karmic rebirth. Through awakening to the Dao and cultivating the true, yin becomes the body’s upright qi, the Six Dings manifest wondrously, and celestial radiance shines in stillness. The true fragrance of the Jade Maiden is the marvelous function of the body.\n\nWith the entire body pervaded by mysterious communion, the Cinnabar Terrace and Jade Towers, the six yang secret realms, and the true king’s timely dominion—this Dharma-body broadly transforms, subjugating tigers and commanding dragons. Refining jade liquid within the Mysterious Palace, arraying the Azure Maidens to the right; gathering the secret treasures of the cinnabar spirit, floating the pure fragrance of the imperial consorts. This too is the manifestation of the Emperor’s light across the ten directions of heavenly realms, where the responsive and transformative Dharma-bodies of the Jade Emperor appear, attended by Perfected Jade Maidens, translocated by divine power to dwell in the Heaven of Pure Tenuity.\n\nEvery person possesses nature, encompasses yin and yang, and contains all wondrous potentials—body and heaven are one. The divine powers and wondrous models of the Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens should be known to all who hear and see them. How is it that the Moonlight Jade Maiden, having attained sagehood and become an attendant of the Emperor, has yet to comprehend this?\n\nNow, cultivation and realization have ranks of nobility and humility, and the sagely body arises from the transformations of the Dao’s source. The fruit attained determines the rank of divine powers—only sages know sages, only the worthy know the worthy, with no room for pretense. The Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens, through their celestial perfection, transform and save beings; thus, their luminous demeanor, wondrous countenance, and true fragrance are rightfully unknown to the Moonlight Jade Maiden. Her lack of knowledge stems from her recent attainment of the sagely body and differing rank, not from evasion or falsehood.\n\nAlas! If even the Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens are not easily known, how then can the divine transformations of the Emperor’s light be fathomed? If the Moonlight Jade Maiden cannot know them, how can others? Sage and mortal share one nature; humans stand shoulder to shoulder with the Jade Emperor. Yet if even knowledge is unattainable, how can one attain sagehood? Let all ponder this and strive.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three on Divine Powers**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Venerable addressed the Moonlight Jade Maiden, saying: You have only recently entered the sagely stream. Though you possess wisdom, you have yet to attain full clarity. These Jade Maidens, from immeasurable kalpas past, have cultivated wondrous practices, attained the gates of liberation, and shared in pure faith, pure understanding, pure mindfulness, pure conduct, pure bodies, pure minds, pure intentions, pure fruits, and pure retributions. They share in great compassion and great mercy, sheltering and protecting sentient beings as a mother cherishes and loves her infant child.",

The Jade Emperor, as the Most High, has received the pure retribution, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices in past kalpas are likewise in this pure retribution.\n\nTheir benevolence pervades the dust-mote realms, and their kindness extends through boundless kalpas. The Jade Emperor possesses great compassion, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices are likewise in this great compassion.\n\nAll myriad beings receive their tender care and pity. The Jade Emperor possesses great mercy, and the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices are likewise in this great mercy.\n\nThe Jade Maidens’ great compassion and mercy are one with the Jade Emperor’s. But how is this so? They shelter and protect sentient beings as a loving mother cherishes and tenderly cares for her infant child with a heart of redoubled affection. Moreover, they uphold the mysterious precepts with unwavering sincerity and single-minded devotion. Some say: reverently upholding the mind and strictly observing the precepts, they concentrate with utter purity and unity, thus inwardly and sincerely returning to the Great Dao. The meaning is even more profound.\n\nThe Jade Maidens’ return to the Great Dao is not momentary. With pure and solemn devotion, they uphold vast vows, and through myriad kalpas, they have always revered and honored the Jade Emperor.\n\nThis foolish one observes: Those who possess the mind of true faith will naturally attain understanding and awakening, sever deluded thoughts, purify their conduct, keep their bodies unstained, their minds clear, and their intentions pure. They will realize the fruit and receive retribution, ultimately attaining the utmost truth. Those who embody great compassion and mercy, strictly uphold wondrous precepts, and reverently serve the Supreme Emperor without wavering through the ages may ascend to the rank of Upper Immortals.\n\nYet worldly people, deluded by heterodox views, harbor杂念 and perverse conduct. They fail to cultivate their bodies, their minds are disturbed, and their intentions are chaotic. Their karmic retributions entangle them, all because they lack compassion and do not believe in the Dao. Thus, though Moonlight has newly entered the sagely stream, she still cannot fully comprehend the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices. To walk the same path as they do is even more difficult.\n\nThe Dao is inherent in all people. If one reflects upon and cultivates it well, the Jade Maidens’ wondrous practices may be realized within oneself.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four on Divine Powers**\n\nThese Jade Maidens are not truly women; they are celestial perfected beings who, to deliver sentient beings, manifest as Jade Maidens. Therefore, their bodily forms, divine powers, wisdom, and transformations—whether hidden or revealed—are equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nAt that time, upon hearing these words, Moonlight attained awakening. She bowed her head in reverence, rejoiced, and silently returned to her place.\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: These Jade Maidens who attend the Jade Emperor, having cultivated manifold wondrous practices through immeasurable kalpas past, are not truly female in form. They are celestial immortals and perfected beings who, to transform and guide sentient beings of the Dharma realms into the Dao, manifest as Jade Maidens. Precisely because they are the transformed bodies of perfected beings—whose original forms are not female—their bodily appearance, divine powers, wisdom, and transformations, whether hidden or revealed, are not superficial but equal to the Jade Emperor’s.\n\nAll people possess bodies, yet the illusory nature of the physical form cannot divide or transform. Thus, it is difficult to share the same body as the Jade Emperor. As for the shape-shifting demons and ghosts, their bodies are deceptive and illusory, and thus not worth mentioning.\n\nAmong the celestial beings above, some may extend five *li*, or several *li*, or one or two *yojanas*, or hundreds of millions of *zhang*. Some reside in heavenly palaces, some perceive the true realm, and some appear among humans. Yet when they manifest in one place, they cannot transform elsewhere. Or, though perceptible to the senses, they cannot skillfully deliver beings, bound as they are to one location or one moment. None of these are the most supreme, wondrous Dharma bodies of transformation.\n\nThe transformed bodies of the Jade Maidens appear throughout all worlds, gathering and dispersing at will, surpassing all others. Their bodies are equal to the Jade Emperor’s. All bodies are composed of form, yet if form is not wondrously refined—or if it is beautiful but not enduring—it is not equal to the Emperor’s form. The transformed bodies of the Jade Maidens possess wondrous beauty, majestic and exquisite, fully manifesting wherever they appear, never changing or declining. Their form is equal to the Emperor’s.",

      "translated_text": "The paths of heavenly beings, demons, and humans all possess spiritual penetrations, yet their transformations are limited, their powers not encompassing the six penetrations—such spiritual penetrations are not equal to the Emperor’s. The Jade Maidens’ divine transformations are boundless, fully possessing the six penetrations; thus, their spiritual penetrations are equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nDivine beings all possess wisdom, yet it is obstructed, not fully illuminated, or relies on borrowed perception, unable to achieve wondrous convergence—such wisdom is not equal to the Emperor’s. The Jade Maidens perceive all without omission, their foresight unobstructed; thus, their wisdom is equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nThose who know spiritual penetrations may all conceal themselves, yet concealment leaves traces—this is not equal to the Emperor’s. When the Jade Maidens disperse, they return to the Great Void, not merely containing Mount Sumeru within a mustard seed; their wondrous concealment leaves no trace, their concealment equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nWhere there is concealment, there is manifestation, yet manifestation is not the great radiance—this is not equal to the Emperor’s. The Jade Maidens wondrously manifest in the pure and subtle, their divine perception spanning all realms; thus, their manifestation is equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nPossessing spiritual penetrations, wisdom, concealment, and manifestation enables transformation. Yet if transformation is contrived, it is not equal to the Emperor’s. The Jade Maidens’ wondrous transformations arise without intention, their divine transformations spontaneous; thus, their transformations are equal to the Emperor’s.\n\nAt that moment, Yeguang, having heard the Primordial Beginning’s discourse on the Jade Maidens’ manifestations and transformations, attained clarity and awakening in his heart. He understood the wondrous causes of the Jade Maidens’ transformations, bowed in reverence, and rejoiced with delight. Silently, he forgot speech and returned to his original position.\n\nA foolish note: The yin and yang of the human body are not two distinctly separate entities but arise from one, becoming two—yin nurtures yang, and yang generates yin, rooted in the utmost origin. Cultivating truth to attain the Dao, the six yin spirits transform and manifest as Jade Maidens, wondrously changing. This marvelous mechanism shares the same function as the primordial spirit and mysterious numen. This yin transformation revealing numinosity is not unique to the earthly quality; it extends to the heavenly body’s nurturing, the transformation of yang’s radiance and Brahman qi. Moreover, the divine immortals of heaven transform without fixed form, teaching and delivering beings according to expedient means. When a male form is needed, they manifest as male; when a female form is required, they transform into female. Through countless kalpas, worlds abound in multiplicity. Those who ought to be delivered by a female form are beyond measure. Thus, the supreme divine immortals of heaven transform into Jade Maidens to deliver multitudes. Their bodily form, spiritual penetrations, wisdom, concealment, manifestation, and transformations surpass all divine beings and are equal to the Jade Emperor’s. Though Yeguang had visited the Three Pure Realms and long heard the Dharma’s sound, he had only recently entered the sacred stream. Such great spiritual penetrations and supreme, wondrous practices were naturally unknown to him. Nevertheless, the sacred and the profane share the same nature, and the Dharma body is universal. With a heart for universal salvation and emulation of the utmost truth, the Jade Maidens’ divine wondrousness equal to the Emperor’s resides within our own bodies. Thus, Yeguang, upon hearing this discourse, attained understanding and rejoiced.

As the Lord of Pure Brightness Heaven and his retinue came, each rode the eight-scene radiant simurgh chariot beneath nine-cloud luminous jeweled canopies. The \"eight scenes\" are also called the eight treasured wondrous scenes, the eight trigram divine scenes, or the eight-hued luminous scenes. Generally, the divine chariots of heaven gather the scenes of the eight directions and embody the harmony of the eight solar terms, hence the term \"eight scenes.\" They performed the Great Mysterious Song and spirit-wondrous music, chanted the boundless merit of the Three Cavern treasure chapters, scattered celestial treasure flowers in all directions, sprayed celestial perfected incense, and, stepping upon the void, traversed the heavens to arrive respectfully before the Dao.\n\nBy the awe-inspiring power, virtue, and divine penetrations of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and Jade Emperor, these multitude of treasure flowers instantly transformed in the void into a single jeweled canopy, shading and sheltering the great assembly of the Dharma gathering without omission.\n\nThis fool observes: When mortals cultivate the truth, pay homage to the Supreme Emperor, revere the Primordial Sovereign, and silently recite the true scriptures, their pure void spirit-light will, upon later audience in the mysterious realm, manifest secret wonders—jade flowers forming canopies, universally covering all wondrous beings. All this is the secret guidance of the Void Sovereign and the compassionate reception of the primordial spirit. Thus, when the Lord of the High Void and Pure Brightness Heaven later arrived at the Dharma banquet, presenting wondrous music and riding the numinous chariot, the celestial flowers he scattered, by the power of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and Jade Emperor, formed a jeweled canopy covering all without exception. Those of aspiration who contemplate this canon and spiritually comprehend it will find that the wondrous transformations of heaven are fully possessed within their own bodies.\n\n*Chapter on Spiritual Penetrations, Twenty-Six*\n\nAt that time, the Lord of the High Void and Pure Brightness Heaven, beholding this rare spectacle, prostrated himself and knelt in reverence, addressing the Heavenly Worthy and Jade Emperor: \"This humble servant, indolent and remiss, arrived late to the Dharma assembly. Today, on this auspicious occasion, I have encountered the Dharma Bridge. The hidden and the manifest, the sacred and the profane, all universally partake of the sagely grace. A great radiance shines forth, revealing rare and wondrous signs, illuminating all heavens above. The Four Brahmā Heavens and Six Desire Realms, all the blessed lands and assemblies of perfected sages, beholding this radiance, gather in clouds. Below, it shines upon the boundless worlds of the lower realms, uniting with the Mysterious Capital, closely adjoining the Nine Heavens. Divine winds perform music, harmonizing palace and note, resonating brightly through the cloud courts, all transforming into Cavern Chapters. All beings universally attain the transformation of the Dao.\n\nIn the Fengdu Iron Enclosure, the eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms, all suffering beings in the hells, by the power of this light, are reborn in the heavens and enjoy bliss. Today, the scattered celestial treasure flowers swiftly coalesced into a canopy, universally covering the Dharma assembly. All in the great congregation partake of the power and awe-inspiring might of this light. Through a thousand kalpas of good causes and the cyclical movements of the Nine Heavens, the imperial Dao flows boundlessly, and the true Dharma flourishes. Today is most auspicious, as we behold and revere the mysterious merit.\"\n\nThe True Lord of Fire said: When the treasure flowers formed a canopy covering all, the Lord of the High Void and Pure Brightness Heaven, witnessing this rare event, prostrated himself and knelt, humbly addressing the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and Jade Emperor. He spoke of himself as a lowly and indolent servant, tardy in attending the Dharma assembly. Today, on this auspicious occasion, he encountered the compassionate salvation of the sagely Dharma Bridge. Bridges in the world are built by mortals to span waterways, sparing them from fording. Yet even the finest worldly bridges, constructed of wood and stone, have limited reach and are prone to decay; they cannot span great rivers, lakes, or seas. But the power of the sagely scriptures and Dharma transcends kalpas, pervades the cosmos, and requires no fabrication or trace. Through subtle transformation and secret divine penetrations, it enables beings to escape the river of love, depart the sea of desire, avoid the blood lake, and dispel great calamities—eternally indestructible, hence called the Dharma Bridge. It spans the hidden paths of darkness and the manifest realms of light. The sagely and the foolish, the wise and the ignorant, all universally partake of its sagely grace.",

      "translated_text": "The Jade Emperor radiates the Great Illuminating Brilliance, manifesting a rare and wondrous divine form. Its light ascends to illumine all heavens of every realm—the Four Brahmā Heavens, the Six Desire Heavens, and every blissful pure land. All the immortals, perfected beings, divine sages, and holy assemblies behold this great radiance and gather like clouds in assembly. The clouds converge in an instant, filling the sky, their origin unknown. The holy hosts swiftly gather like clouds, hence called \"cloud assembly.\" The light descends to illumine the boundless worlds below, all of which become as the Pure Subtlety Heaven’s Mystic Capital, closely linked in spirit to the Nine Celestial Upper Heavens. Within the light, a divine breeze plays celestial melodies, harmonizing as palace modes and shang tones blend. Though the five notes—palace, shang, and the rest—distinguish clarity and turbidity and correspond to the Five Phases, their natural wonder is not easily matched. The Emperor’s divine breeze harmonizes exquisitely of itself, far surpassing mortal music. As palace and shang tones resonate, they stir and resound through the cloud courts, transforming into the precious chapters of the Three Caverns. All beings in the worlds below universally attain the mysterious transformation of the Great Dao.\n\nIn the Fengdu prisons, the Iron-Walled Citadel, the eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms, and all the hells, suffering beings look up to receive the power of the Jade Emperor’s great illuminating Dharma. They are all reborn in the heavenly palaces, where they enjoy bliss. Today, the celestial treasures and wondrous flowers I have scattered swirl and weave into a floral canopy, universally covering and sheltering all assembled at this Dharma feast. All look up to receive the majestic power and divine virtue of the Heavenly Worthy Jade Emperor.\n\nWe, the Lords of the Pure Clarity Heaven, are not merely fortunate in this single lifetime to encounter such a rarity. Through countless kalpas, we have cultivated good causes, and now we meet the auspicious convergence of the Nine Heavens, where the imperial Dao of Heaven flows vast and level, and the profound and wondrous true Dharma flourishes in full splendor.\n\nOne version states: When the Primordial Beginning initiated transformation and expounded the supreme Dharma, the imperial wind was profound and serene, the Great Dao level and even. At that time, no heterodox paths existed, and the true Dharma flourished in its prime. This meaning is also acceptable.\n\nToday’s celebration in the celestial realm is a most auspicious occasion. All divine beings and every living creature universally receive and rely upon the most mysterious transformative power.\n\nAnother version states: All desire to look up in hope of the mysterious power and humbly present the essentials of the Dao. This is also acceptable.\n\nIn my humble opinion: Though the human body is small, it encompasses Heaven and Earth, contains the myriad existences, and embraces all wonders. The pure, empty, and numinous qi governs the six yang, and there is also the Lord of the High, Empty, Pure Clarity Heaven. If the primordial spirit loses its governance and the mysterious transformation does not manifest, one is drawn into the waves of affection, sunk in the sea of suffering. The vast currents and towering waves surge without end—how can one avoid drowning and rescue those lost in darkness?\n\nWhen even one person is steeped in delusion, they sink and drag others down with them, leading both astray—a matter not worth discussing. Those who stagnate in the Lesser Vehicle or are deluded by side paths, like flowing water without a source, cannot escape drying up—this, too, is not worth mentioning. Occasionally, one dredges the wellspring of the numinous and connects with the pulse of the Dao, gradually nearing transformation. Yet if one hoards their own richness and fails to let virtue descend, this is not the great accomplishment.\n\nThus, some attain the fruits of the Four Brahmā or Six Desire Heavens but do not reach the Nine Celestial or Seven Treasures realms. Some receive blessings among humans, or become lords of hells or demon kings. Some even sink into the Three Evil Paths or are lost in the Nine Dark Realms—what sorrow could be greater? When the numinous transformation is not manifest and the wondrous resonance is not revealed, the true scriptures fail to circulate. The jade-like flowers lose their luster because one has not cultivated good causes or believed in the true Dharma. Thus, one cannot hear the vast and level Dao or look up to receive the mysterious power.\n\nIf one can concentrate the mysterious spirit, stabilize the Heavenly Lord, and embody the pure, empty, and wondrously numinous, then when the later mechanism is activated, one will penetrate the Cao Creek, drink the entire Western River, merge with the golden liquid, and ascend the shore of the Dao. The sea of suffering and the pit of karma will be forever extinguished. One will transcend the Six Desires, rise above the Four Brahmā, universally unite with the myriad spirits, and illumine the dark realms. The divine breeze stirs the true, the wondrous resonance is peerless, and the true scriptures silently circulate without cease. The myriad existences receive boundless grace. Fengdu’s walls are breached, the Nine Dark Realms are illuminated, hells transform into heavens, and sinful beings become pure lands. The yin turbidity of the body entirely shifts to yang clarity; jade-like flowers radiate rosy hues, sheltering all wonders. This is truly the numinous power of the August Emperor and the force of the primordial spirit. Without accumulating cultivation and nurturing the true Dharma with unwavering faith, how could one hear the auspicious wind of the imperial Dao or look up to receive the mysterious power?\n\nAlas! The wondrous truth of this body is revealed when we, the Lords of the Pure Clarity Heaven, arrive late at the Dharma feast and celebrate the encounter with the Dharma Bridge. To praise the sagely transformation and extol the mysterious power is to say that the Dao universally saves the dark and the manifest alike. Yet to cultivate good causes, broaden wondrous practices, not seek hasty transformation, and let the wondrous root arise naturally—this is the secret of attaining sagely perfection. Those who study the Dao should savor this and realize it for themselves.\n\n**Chapter on Spiritual Penetrations, Verse 27**\n\nAt this time, as the holy assembly all look up to receive the mysterious power, the Lord of the High, Empty, Pure Clarity Heaven—explained previously—praises the Jade Emperor in verse:\n\nThe Lord of the Pure Clarity Heaven praises the Jade Emperor in verse:\n\nGolden Portal, Mystic Vault Ancestor,\n*(Ancestor: One version reads \"Lord.\" Considering the scripture’s meaning, the Jade Emperor is the Lord of Heaven, teacher of all buddhas, and ruler of the Golden Portal, the venerable elder of the Mystic Capital’s vaulted heavens, hence called \"Ancestor.\" If rendered as \"Lord,\" it refers only to the Heavenly Emperor.)*\n\nSupreme Jade Emperor Worthy,\n*(Explained previously.)*\n\nWondrous form crowns all heavens,\n*(All divine beings in the heavens possess fine forms, but some may decline or be limited in their transformations. Each resides in their own heaven and cannot assume all forms; their appearances and countenances are not supremely transcendent. The Jade Emperor’s form is wondrously excellent without limit, his appearance and countenance uniquely surpassing all heavens.)*\n\nCompassionate light illumines the Three Realms.\n*(His great compassionate radiance illumines the heavens above, the earth below, and the human realm in between, hence called \"universally illumines the Three Realms.\")*\n\nTrue Sage, Wondrous Dao’s Master.",

Through subtle transformation and secret divine penetrations, it enables beings to escape the river of love, depart the sea of desire, avoid the blood lake, and dispel great calamities—eternally indestructible, hence called the Dharma Bridge. It spans the hidden paths of darkness and the manifest realms of light. The sagely and the foolish, the wise and the ignorant, all universally partake of its sagely grace.",

      "translated_text": "One tradition states: The Jade Emperor’s conduct is truly sagely and mystically wondrous—he is the revered master of the Dao’s lineage. Heavenly and mortal beings rely upon this master. The Jade Emperor serves as the teaching lord of heaven and humanity, sovereign of all spirits, and supreme divine sage of the heavens. All people in the world revere and depend upon him, drawing upon his transformative power; thus, he is the teacher of heaven and humanity.\n\nHe expounds the Great Vehicle’s teachings,\n*(The Dao’s teachings are divided into three vehicles: upper, middle, and lower. There is also a supreme vehicle, which transcends all ranks, surpassing the three grades and encompassing all without omission—this is the Great Vehicle. The teachings of various spirits follow their own wisdom and insight; the Great Vehicle is rarely heard. The Jade Emperor’s dispensation of the Dao clarifies and reveals the true essence, penetrating from highest to lowest, encompassing all grades. All beings who receive his instruction attain liberation—this is the Great Vehicle’s expounding of the Dharma.)*\n\nHe points out the true One to those lost on the path.\n*(The Jade Emperor employs the true essence and the mystic principle of the One to illuminate and awaken those who have strayed, offering direct transmission without deviation, preventing them from falling into lesser or misguided teachings. It is like pointing someone toward the main road, ensuring they do not stray onto crooked paths.)*\n\nHis virtue and power are like the emptiness of space.\n*(All things in the world have limits and come to an end. Only the emptiness of space remains unchanged through kalpas, never altering. The Jade Emperor’s vast merit and supreme virtue are boundless, like the emptiness of space, impossible to fathom. While other divine sages possess merit and virtue, whether great or small, near or distant, they may be compared within their own measure. The Jade Emperor’s virtue and power defy comparison—thus, they are like the emptiness of space.)*\n\nHis praises are inexhaustible.\n*(The Jade Emperor’s virtue and power are like the emptiness of space; his praises cannot be fully expressed, and devotion to him knows no end. His praises are boundless, and his sublime power cannot be named. As Huang Shigong said: Though the Lord of the High Void and Pure Clarity later attended the Dharma assembly, upon truly witnessing the Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformations and divine splendor, he was filled with endless admiration. Thus, he composed sublime verses to extol the Jade Emperor. In ancient times, Zai Wo, Zigong, and You Ruo excelled in praising and revering Confucius, for their wisdom was sufficient to recognize a sage. Now, the Lord of Pure Clarity praises the Jade Emperor’s virtue and power as boundless as the emptiness of space, his praises inexhaustible—no other eulogy has been so thorough and complete. This is akin to the wisdom of Zai Wo, Zigong, and You Ruo in recognizing Confucius. These verses may truly be called \"words of insight.\")\n\nMy humble observation: The primordial spirit of the human body remains unchanged through kalpas; the true master of the four limbs is the origin of all existence. It wondrously crowns the six yang, compassionately protects the three origins, and serves as the true teacher of the self, upon which the spirit and qi depend. Its numinous illumination shines brightly, its Dharma voice is supreme, directly shattering delusion and revealing the all-encompassing path. Its wondrous essence and mysterious power—wherever its virtue extends, it is equal to the emptiness of space. How could praises ever be exhausted? Yet people fail to turn inward and reflect, to comprehend this true essence. They do not recognize the supreme virtue within themselves, nor the Jade Emperor’s virtue and power—how then could they grasp the benefits of this scripture’s merit? No wonder they do not awaken to the true reality.\n\nThe Lord of Pure Clarity, gazing upon the Jade Emperor’s virtue and power, composed sublime verses in praise, not only to extol the blessings of heaven but also to instruct people to turn their light inward. If one can align with their original true nature, understand the power of the Dao, and emulate heaven’s impartiality, sharing the same merit as the Emperor, they will not be misled by other paths, nor lose their celestial treasure. Thus may they aspire to sagehood. Let those of resolve take heed.\n\n**Chapter on Spiritual Powers, Twenty-Eighth**\n\nHe is the Lord of the Vault of Heaven, honored through kalpas without end. His wondrous vision and wondrous knowledge are peerless and unmatched. Profoundly still and truly pure, he is neither gone nor present, yet both gone and present. Supreme sage, supreme spirit, great in spiritual power, repository of radiance, mighty hero—he enlightens humans and heavens, teaching without end. Vast in compassion, vast in mercy, he turns the wheel of the Dharma, delivering all beings. Thus is he named the Jade Emperor, the true elder of the vault of heaven, wondrously perfect, pure, and serene. His wisdom and eloquence, his Dao and his honor, are supreme. To liberate all beings, he emits this light.\n\nAt that time, the Lord of the High Void and Pure Clarity, having spoken his verses in praise, sat in silent meditation.\n\nWei Boyang said: The Lord of the High Void and Pure Clarity, in extolling the Jade Emperor’s virtue and power, not only composed ten verses of praise but also declared: This Jade Emperor is the sagely lord of the vaulted and boundless heavens, the supreme honor through kalpas without measure. *(Ordinary kalpas have numbers—whether hundreds of millions or trillions—but none can be called \"vast.\" The Jade Emperor has served as the teaching lord of the ten thousand heavens through kalpas beyond count, vast and profound, impossible to fathom. Hence, he is called \"honored through kalpas without end.\")* His far-reaching illumination leaves nothing unlit; his spiritual powers and wondrous vision penetrate all without obstruction. His great awakening and mystic knowledge have no equal, no peer for comparison. Radiant and translucent, profoundly still, majestic and unshaken, he is without duality, without cessation. His Dao is utterly true; his virtue utterly pure, unstained and unsullied.\n\nVast as if gone—yet not truly gone, for it is the natural state of emptiness. Vast as if present—yet not clinging to presence, for it is the wondrous existence of non-attachment. Whether vast as gone or vast as present, it cannot be clearly seen or measured. All immortals, buddhas, and spirits revere the Jade Emperor as the most supreme among sages. Among all divine beings, none possess spiritual powers like his. He is the most exalted and mysterious spirit, his transformations sixfold and transcendent, surpassing all. Truly, his great spiritual power illumines eternally, his radiance pure and undimmed, ever emerging, never extinguished or obscured. He is the true repository of radiance, containing boundless great light.\n\nNone is more honored than the Dao. The Jade Emperor embodies the Dao’s spontaneity, vast beyond measure, without limit. Rightly is he called the mighty hero. *(Worldly worthies perfect body and nature, rectify themselves and others, and encompass heaven and earth—this is the mighty hero. The Jade Emperor transforms heaven and earth, gives rise to people and things, without beginning or end. Among sages, he is the most honored; among spirits, the greatest. What hero could surpass him?)* He enlightens and transforms all humans and heavens, teaching and guiding the Dao without end. He covers and loves all existence, pitying and mindful of all beings, without limit.",

Now, to enlighten and uplift all beings, he radiates this great compassionate light, universally illuminating.\n\nAt that moment, the Lord of the High Void and Luminous Heavens spoke this gāthā in praise, then fell silent and resumed his seat.\n\n*(My humble note: The primordial spirit within the human body is none other than the Jade Emperor of the heavens, known as the Primordial Sovereign, the True Lord, the Mysterious Origin, the Ancestral Perfected, the Celestial Monarch, the Nature School, the True Ancestral Origin, the Dharma-nature, the Wondrous Luminous True Mind, the Right Nature, the Mysterious Numinous, the True Master, the Mysterious Radiance, the Great Pillar, the Dharma King, the Wondrous Treasure, the True Root, the Buddha-nature, the True Seed, and the Cinnabar Primordial.)*\n\nThe true lord of the body, uniquely wondrous and peerless, holds infinite luminous potential, transforming yin and yang, his divine wisdom unfathomable.

Silently merging essence and qi, he nurtures the true numinous. Thus, the true light reveals itself at times, and the wondrous mechanism perpetually arises. Those who embody this naturally give birth to the divine infant, sharing the Jade Emperor’s merit and virtue, their Dao-transformations endless.\n\nOnly when one truly grasps the gāthā of the Lord of the Luminous Heavens in praise of the Emperor does genuine knowledge and realization arise. Otherwise, the true mystery remains unattained, and the Emperor’s transformations go unrecognized. The verses of the Luminous Gāthā, when recited, may seem like a dream—how then can one attain the merit of the scripture or reap its true benefits?\n\nAlas! The nature of the Dao resides within us, its true mystery self-sufficient. To comprehend the wondrous luminous true mechanism is to truly respond to and extol the Jade Emperor’s glorious radiance.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Divine Powers**\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies, saying: This Emperor’s body is the Dao-body, no ordinary form. It is the body of boundless merit and virtue, the body of true purity and spontaneity, the indestructible true emptiness of divine luminosity, the supreme Dharma-body.\n\nHis majestic spirit vast and expansive, his renown all-pervading, no darkness escapes his illumination. His divine subtlety towering and sublime, beyond all description.\n\nThe Barefoot Great Immortal said: After the Lord of the Luminous Heavens recited the gāthā in praise of the Jade Emperor, he resumed his seat in silence.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning again addressed the four assemblies at the Dharma assembly, saying: This wondrous transformative body of the Jade Emperor is the great Dao-body, no ordinary form.\n\nThe Dao is originally formless—how then can one speak of a \"body\"? Though the Dao is void and boundless, infinite and inexhaustible, it transforms the ten thousand things, completes beginnings and ends, animates yin and yang without cease. Truly empty yet possessing substance, it is not mere nothingness. The Jade Emperor’s merit and virtue are like the vastness of empty space, his spirit one with the Dao. Thus it is said: the Emperor’s body is the Dao-body, no ordinary form.\n\nIt is the body of inexhaustible great merit and virtue, the body of true purity, true clarity, and spontaneity, unbound. Merit has limits, virtue may be exhausted—how can one speak of boundlessness? The Jade Emperor transforms all worlds, unchanged since time immemorial—how could he be limited?\n\nTo be attached to form or constrained by appearances is not true purity or spontaneity. The Jade Emperor, forever free from defilement, attains great freedom—is this not spontaneity?\n\nIt is the body of divine luminosity, firm and enduring, the indestructible true emptiness, the supreme and incomparable wondrous Dharma-body. All things in the world possessing form are subject to decay—only emptiness endures. That which decays is neither firm nor divine. Since the great void abides, emptiness is the ultimate truth.\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s divine power persists through the ages undiminished, his mysterious radiance endures through kalpas unvanquished. Not only is he supremely divine and luminous, but his firmness is unassailable, his solidity unbreakable, forever immune to destruction or decay. It is the ever-abiding true emptiness, the indestructible wondrous body, the supreme and peerless Dharma-body.\n\nWho could easily fathom his majestic virtue and divine radiance? Vast and boundless, expansive beyond measure, his inconceivable names and titles overflow, pervading the ten directions. His light reaches every mote of dust, no darkness escapes his illumination. His divine powers and mysteries towering and immeasurable, vast and indescribable—how could one ever fully extol them?\n\n*(My humble note: The human nature is inherently luminous and divinely subtle, self-so. With the three bodies complete and the four wisdoms perfected, the vast qi of integrity, the essence of true unity, the myriad virtues and wondrous qualities—what is lacking? Yet in this fleeting body, one bears the responsibilities of the three realms, with no respite. It is no ordinary form, but the Dao-body, the body of boundless merit and virtue, the body of true purity and spontaneity, the indestructible true emptiness of divine luminosity, the supreme Dharma-body. How then do worldly people indulge themselves, squandering this body, their minds burdened and spirits scattered, essence depleted and qi dispersed, their nature and Dao obscured? Who attends to the mandate of destiny? The essentials of the Dao remain elusive. The illusory body vanishes in emptiness, this life passes in vain, existence and extinction like a dream—utterly unaware. How then can one attain transformation?)*\n\nSome may possess luminous virtue and fulfill their nature, yet fail to preserve their attainment to the end. Thus, people cannot exhaust the divine and attain transformation, return to emptiness and become immortals, or merge with the Dao as one.\n\nOnly the Jade Emperor, whose body is the Dao, whose merit and virtue are boundless, whose purity and spontaneity are innate, whose divine luminosity is firm and indestructible, whose true emptiness is unassailable, and whose Dharma-body is supreme—his name remains imperishable.\n\nFor those newly entering the sagely stream, even a single gap remains unbridged.

      "translated_text": "The Primordial Beginning took pity on sentient beings’ prolonged delusion and extolled the Emperor’s virtue as vast and far-reaching, fully awakening those deaf and blind through kalpas past to witness the wondrous efficacy of divine transformation. In true great compassion and profound benevolence, he desired all beings to enter the sublime, expanding his majestic numen and pervading his renown, illuminating the hidden and subtle, divine and wondrous, towering and boundless—his virtue defying all names. Such is the Heavenly Worthy’s great vow.\n\nYet the world drifts and founders, human hearts sink and drown, unable to follow the Emperor’s principles or uphold the Primordial Beginning’s teachings. Alas! Heaven and humanity share one principle, sage and mortal share one heart—failing to emulate the sage and aspire to heaven, the Dao’s law is natural, and one truly falls short before the true scriptures, the great Dao, parents, and the body of life. Such is the plight of those with resolve.\n\nThe thirty chapters on *Divine Transformations* declare: This Emperor is not one whose merit arises from cultivated deeds. Though in the past he descended to be born among humans, traversing many kalpas to enact transformation, demonstrating great divine transformations, his body remained pure and undefiled. Never did he cease residing in the Golden Palace, manifesting in myriad forms, responding to all directions, aiding and delivering sentient beings, elevating them to the Dao’s shore, universally bestowing teachings, awakening later generations. Those who follow and uphold his teachings ascend to truth and attain the Dao. Through such merit and virtue, his adornment is such that his radiance perpetually fills all heavens, his divine wisdom wondrously penetrating, beyond all measure.\n\nThe Perfected of Wondrous Conduct said: This towering, divinely wondrous Jade Emperor, whose virtues defy full enumeration, does not rely on contrived deeds or forced merit for cultivation and realization. In kalpas past, though he descended to be born among humans, traversing many kalpas to broadly enact teachings and display great divine transformations—renouncing kingship to cultivate the Dao, severing love to study the Way, administering medicines to heal illness, expounding the Dao to propagate transformation, enduring insult with joyful renunciation, attaining the rank of Golden Immortal, teaching and delivering bodhisattvas through kalpas—thus do the Buddhist scriptures record the causes of buddhas’ births, speaking of descending from Tuṣita Heaven upon a fragrant elephant into the womb of Queen Māyā, whence the Buddha of Literature was born. This, too, is but one manifestation of the Jade Emperor’s teachings, adapted to circumstances.\n\nElsewhere, he attended the Assembly of Floating Radiance, the Assembly of the Jeweled Pearl, assuming the forms of commoners and Daoists, wherever he encountered the numinous, universally delivering without cease. As Lord of all Heavenly Worthies, his divine transformations are immeasurable. Through many kalpas of enacting transformation and displaying great divine transformations, his Dharma-body remained pure and undefiled, towering and unshaken, never absent from the Golden Palace of Yellow and Gold.\n\nWhen the Primordial Beginning was about to expound the *Jade Scripture*, the Emperor emitted a great light, instantly dividing his body to pervade the great heavenly palaces of the ten directions. In every world—above in heaven, below on earth, among humans—all beheld the radiance, each receiving benefit and joy, together hearing the Great Vehicle. Such was his division of body, transformation, and response to all directions, aiding and delivering sentient beings, elevating them to the Dao’s shore. The merit thus accrued was not confined to one time or place but universally bestowed teachings, opening and awakening later generations. Those who reverently follow the scriptures and honor the Emperor’s command may ascend to the rank of highest perfected and fulfill the great Dao.\n\nThe Emperor’s adornment with this supreme, wondrous merit is why his emitted radiance perpetually fills all heavens, his divine and great wisdom spiritually wondrous and penetrating, beyond all measurement and reckoning. His divine wisdom wondrously penetrating, his great radiance is no mere transient light—his virtue flourishes, and his light is wondrous. Beyond all measure, his divine wisdom wondrously penetrating is no fleeting attainment—his Dao is wondrous, and his divinity manifest. Thus is it ever clearer that the Emperor’s merit does not rely on cultivated deeds.\n\nThis fool observes: The primordial spirit of humans endures through kalpas unchanged; its great divine radiance and wondrousness defy easy description. How could it be achieved through intentional action? In hearing and seeing, awareness and knowing, movement and stillness, sitting and lying, eating and resting, speech and silence, responding to stimuli and reciprocating—though manifesting wondrously according to conditions, the pure original substance never departs the cinnabar palace, instantly congealing the mysterious and wondrous to produce the divine infant, while the true and real remains ever unseparated. In a hundred billion transformations, aiding and delivering according to direction, guiding beings to the Dao’s shore, broadly proclaiming the numinous essence, enlightening those of later times—guarding the secret and upholding the true, transcending the mortal and attaining the sage, all transformations reach fulfillment, no fruit left unripened. Through such wondrous conduct as adornment, a single gleam of mysterious radiance pervades all without obstruction, the marvelous efficacy of nature and Dao defying all measurement and reckoning. Behold the Jade Emperor’s sagely virtue and divine efficacy, untainted by contrivance and beyond all measure—are they not of one accord?\n\nThough the nature of inherent perfection is shared, the reckless and abandoned are many, allowing their pure and upright nature to be obscured by lust and delusion, like a bright mirror buried in dust, its radiance unseen. Thus beauty and ugliness remain hidden, and the wondrous intent unmanifest. Yet if one scrapes away the grime and polishes the light, renewing day by day and growing month by month, responding without intention, the true and real is naturally at ease. The Golden Palace and Purple Mansion eternally house the primordial spirit, constantly responding yet constantly still, undisturbed in the least. In wondrous discernment, the one pervades the myriad; in manifest conduct, it responds without attachment. In great compassion and vast vows, it never regresses; in myriad wondrous adornments, it defies enumeration. Through boundless cultivation, true radiance naturally pervades—his merit and virtue are inconceivable.\n\nAlas! This Dao is inherently possessed by humans, neither reliant on cultivated deeds nor attainable through stubborn emptiness, neither existent nor nonexistent. Those of discernment embody it.\n\nThe thirty-first chapter on *Divine Transformations* states: The radiance of this body bears wondrous names. They are called: Great Divine Transformation Light, Great Compassion Light, Great Joyful Renunciation Light, Great Forbearance Light, Great Equanimity Light, Great Gentleness Light, Great Freedom Light, Great Benefit Light, Great Wish-Fulfilling Light, Great Wisdom Light, Great Auspiciousness Light, Great Liberation Light, Great Refuge Light, Great Merit Light, Great Perfection Light, Great Unobstructed Light, and Invincible Light.\n\nThe Perfected of Great Wisdom said: The great radiance emitted by the Jade Emperor’s body bears these supreme and wondrous names.",

      "translated_text": "What are these radiant names? They refer to the seventeen great lights, beginning with Great Divine Transformation Light. The Jade Emperor universally bestows illumination and embrace; through wondrous practices and accumulated realizations, he possesses great numinous power and is endowed with the six divine penetrations. His Divine Transformation Light adorns and illumines all things—this is the first of the radiant names.\n\nNext, the Emperor embodies great compassion, great mercy; his boundless compassion and mercy manifest in wondrous, vast radiance. Great Compassion Light is the second.\n\nFurther, the Emperor truly embodies joyful renunciation; his boundless joy and renunciation shine with wondrous, universal brightness. Great Joyful Renunciation Light is the third.\n\nThrough kalpas uncounted, the Emperor has cultivated great forbearance; his limitless forbearance emits an unstoppable radiance. Great Forbearance Light is the fourth.\n\nIn former cultivations, the Emperor practiced great equanimity; his ceaseless equanimity shines with an irresistible light. Great Equanimity Light is the fifth.\n\nIn past kalpas, the Emperor also embodied great gentleness; his tender harmony remains unchanged through vast eons, universally manifesting an inexhaustible radiance. Great Gentleness Light is the sixth.\n\nThe Emperor’s virtue is tranquil and serene, transcendent and free; his expansive, luminous radiance knows no end. Great Freedom Light is the seventh.\n\nThe Emperor’s benevolence is vast and boundless, eternally benefiting all; his unceasing beneficence shines with dharma-splendor. Great Benefit Light is the eighth.\n\nThe Emperor’s universal body has realized wondrous awakening; pure and spontaneous, he is the Dharma King, the Tathāgata. After countless kalpas, he attained the imperial throne, his supreme merit transcending thought, his numinous transformations perfectly responsive. His Wish-Fulfilling Light endures without limit. Great Wish-Fulfilling Light is the ninth.\n\nThe Emperor possesses great wisdom, great discernment; his wisdom surpasses all, his radiance peerless. Great Wisdom Light is the tenth.\n\nThe Emperor is fundamentally perfectly good, eternally supremely auspicious; his radiance shines ceaselessly. Great Auspiciousness Light is the eleventh.\n\nThe Emperor, having long awakened, attained great liberation; spontaneously released, his golden light shines forever. Great Liberation Light is the twelfth.\n\nThe Emperor is one with the great Dao, the wondrous dharma spontaneous; through endless kalpas, his true faith never wavers. All in the ten directions and future ages eternally revere and uphold him, turning their spirits to the Dao, their radiance ever bright and undimmed. Great Refuge Light is the thirteenth.\n\nThe Emperor universally delivers boundless beings, perfectly accomplishing all without omission; his merit is supreme, his radiance ever resplendent. Great Merit Light is the fourteenth.\n\nWith merit perfected and the Dao complete, the Emperor’s virtue is perfectly fulfilled; his universal light shines eternally, signifying his accomplishment. Great Perfection Light is the fifteenth.\n\nFrom dust and defilement long purified, his wondrous penetration is perfectly luminous; his numinous transformations unobstructed, the Emperor’s light shines forever. Great Unobstructed Light is the sixteenth.\n\nNoblest among spirits, most revered among sages, Lord of the Myriad Heavens, Teacher of all Buddhas—throughout the vast kalpas and dharma realms, none surpass the Jade Emperor. Thus, his radiance perpetually fills all realms, his numinous transformations immeasurable. Invincible Light—is this not the seventeenth of the great lights?\n\nThese seventeen great lights, with their wondrous and numinous meanings, are now manifested by the Jade Emperor—how could his divine transformations be measured?\n\nThis humble observer notes: In the realm of human existence, the cultivation of true nature is paramount. Thus, the *Biographies of Immortals* regard this as the seed of great radiance. Though the true seed is fully possessed, none preserve it; thus, in the realm of delusion, one must undertake the work of purification. Therefore, to each supreme good cause corresponds a wondrous, divine light. The Jade Emperor’s accumulated cultivation is immeasurable, his wondrous practices inexhaustible—why only seventeen great lights? For the faculties of beings are many and difficult to awaken, and the transformations of the Dao are profound. The Emperor’s seventeen lights are like the Buddha manifesting his thirty-two-foot form while emitting great auspicious light from his crown. Moreover, the Emperor’s light is supremely wondrous, transcending all comparison—who could trace his wondrous practices or comprehend the seventeen great meanings? Alas, this is difficult to attain, yet it may be hoped for. The Dao resides within oneself: negligence dims it, diligence brightens it. Cultivate effortless practice without seeking swift transformation, and the Dao will naturally be attained.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Divine Transformations**\n\nThus, those among you who desire to behold the Emperor yet cannot do so are hindered because you remain attached to body and speech, unable to relinquish habitual tendencies, afflictive actions, and karmic deeds. Due to these obstructions, you cannot gaze upon the Emperor’s compassionate countenance. I shall now proclaim for this assembly the method to sever these hindrances; all of you should each uphold and practice it.\n\nAt that time, the great assembly was overcome with joy, each bowing their heads before the Most Revered, desiring to hear the teaching.\n\nMaster Lei, the Radiant Elder, said: The Jade Emperor emits seventeen great lights, his divine transformations immeasurable. Thus, even the Heavenly Lords of the Lofty Void and Pure Brightness, though desiring to truly behold the Jade Emperor, cannot do so. The reason is this: though you are free from dust and defilement, having realized the station of Heavenly Emperor, the supreme Mahāyāna has not been fully penetrated. You remain attached to body and speech, unable to relinquish the habitual tendencies of countless kalpas—ignorance, afflictions, and the transgressions of mundane actions. Due to these obstructions, you cannot behold the Jade Emperor’s compassionate countenance.\n\nHabitual tendencies arise from worldly desires and defilements. All delusive entanglements must not be coveted; yet, due to insufficient wisdom and excessive attachment, thoughts arise, gradually leading to contamination. Entangled by external objects, the bonds deepen, forming toxic habits like ropes tightly knotted, difficult to untie in an instant. Long-ingrained defilements are not easily removed; the roots of evil karma remain unpurified. Habitual tendencies toward worldly desires may accumulate afflictions, transgressive actions, or karmic conditions—endless distractions, unceasing disturbances, and the burdens of past deeds obscure and obstruct. Though you now govern the Brahmā heavens, your realization remains incomplete, the profound mystery not fully grasped. How then could you behold the Most Supreme? Thus, you cannot immediately see the Jade Emperor.",

      "translated_text": "Here now do I, for this assembly of disciples, clearly expound and reveal the method to sever and dissolve all obstructions. Let each among you uphold and practice it with utmost devotion.\n\nAt that moment, the great assembly overflowed with joy and exultation, each prostrating before the Jade Table of the Primordial Beginning, bowing their heads in reverence, eager to hear the esoteric discourse on severing obstructions.\n\nI—this is the self-designation of the Primordial Beginning. *Table*—a desk or stand.\n\nI observe: since birth, each person carries karmic conditions from former lives. Though the kalpas renew and the qi of Great Harmony prevails, the cultivation of past eons is not easily forgotten at once. Thus, the scriptures compare the latent karmic affinities to accumulated toxins—truly an insightful analogy. Those bound by auspicious affinities may meet as kindred spirits across distant lands, while those entangled in malevolent affinities may remain as strangers though face-to-face. Do not dismiss the records of the *Daoist Canon* or the annals of Buddhist teachings as heterodox doctrines; even within Confucian texts, Yan Ying’s opposition to Confucius was attributed to fate, and the great scholars Cheng and Su were divided into the factions of Shu and Luo—such too is the misfortune of ill-matched affinities. Yet those who ought to be close may grow distant over time, a lament shared across ages. How then can the doctrine of karmic conditions be entirely abandoned?\n\nThus, the ten perceptions are not easily exhausted, the five aggregates not easily fathomed. The thirteen kinds of disciples, the twenty-five demonic seeds, the seven illusions and three unions—all these mechanisms and snares, who can easily escape? The Lord of the Pure Bright Heaven, though enthroned as a supreme deity and freed from worldly defilements, has not yet transcended the accumulated karma of countless kalpas, lingering in the lofty void, styled the Pure and Bright. Past virtuous causes have not yet shed the trappings of emptiness. How then could one such as the Jade Emperor, who embodies the wondrous existence of empty luminosity, be readily perceived?\n\nIn examining the sutras and the bodhisattva path, even those who beheld the face of Śākyamuni Tathāgata did not truly see him. When the Buddha of Measureless Light expounded the supreme truth, the bodhisattvas listened in silence—such is the meaning here. How easily can the Most Sagely be seen? How easily can the obstructions of bodily and verbal habits be dissolved?\n\nYet this principle is most difficult to perceive: to *see* the Emperor is not to see with the eyes; to fully comprehend the Emperor’s conduct is to thoroughly align with his virtue. As among Confucius’ disciples, only those who truly received the Master’s transmission of the heart-mind attained the one mechanism. When the heart is sincere, though times and worlds differ, the principle remains the same. Only through spiritual communion and heart-mind resonance is true vision attained. Even the wise Yan Hui fell short by a single degree; how then should the Lord of the Pure Bright Heaven, unable to behold the Jade Emperor, be doubted?\n\nThe method of the Primordial Beginning to sever the demonic array is to illumine past deeds, verify the heart’s essence, and dissolve all barriers. Once inner obstructions are melted away, what external hindrance remains? Then the Jade Emperor may be seen. Thus, the assembly yearned to hear these teachings.\n\nAlas! The arising of obstructions and the breaking of demonic arrays—all proceed from the mind. With great penetration and unimpeded freedom, one’s original spirit responds without negligence. The coarse traces of speech and hearing must not become stagnant obstructions. Is not the Great Dao within me? Strive on!\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Divine Penetrations**\nThe Heavenly Worthy spoke:\nThe method to sever obstructions is to generate great wisdom. Do not arouse doubt, do not arouse greed or anger, do not arouse sensual desire, do not arouse jealousy, do not arouse killing or harm, do not arouse mundane emotions, do not arouse mundane thoughts, do not arouse dullness or defilement, do not arouse sound or form, do not arouse right or wrong, do not arouse love or hatred, do not arouse discrimination, do not arouse arrogance, do not arouse attachment.\n\nGuangchengzi said: When the assembly of the pure requested the Primordial Heavenly Worthy to expound the wondrous principle of obstruction-free vision, he declared: To sever obstructions and behold the wondrous transformation and radiant countenance of the Jade Emperor, there is no other way—one must generate the divine wisdom of the spirit-mind, firmly believe in the true Dao, and not arouse the heart of doubt, duality, or confusion.\n\nThe Great Dao is utterly correct, the True One without duality—there is fundamentally nothing to doubt. Yet when clarity is insufficient to perceive the subtleties, one wavers between two extremes, lacking steadfast vision, and demonic knowledge infiltrates. Once you know the Great Dao resides within you, guard this knowing with firmness. Do not divide it into two, do not multiply it into three—what then is there to doubt? Without doubt, there is no confusion, and the Dao may be entered.\n\nThus, the great wisdom that severs obstructions and dissolves ingrained habits must first be free of doubt. Seekers of the Dao must not calculate merit, nor seek it elsewhere. Anger, resentment, indignation, and discontent—none of these may arise.\n\nNext in severing obstructions: do not arouse greed or anger. With the heart focused on the Dao, its center remains naturally pure. Nurturing private desires and indulging in excess easily gives rise to deluded thoughts; even the slightest inclination toward sensual indulgence or craving greatly disrupts the truth.\n\nThird in severing obstructions: do not arouse sensual desire. The Dao embraces all without exception; the worthy and the unworthy alike are my teachers and friends. Even the slightest envy of the worthy or disdain for the mediocre is a grave error.\n\nFourth in severing obstructions: do not arouse jealousy. The Great Dao is supremely benevolent, not tolerating even the slightest harm. If, due to adversity or malice, one harbors thoughts of eradication, this is a grave departure from the Dao.\n\nFifth in severing obstructions: do not arouse killing or harm. Though the *Yinfu Jing* speaks of the mechanism of killing, it refers only to the ability to subdue and restrain demonic forces, whereby true freedom is attained. As in autumn’s solemn withering, when grasses and trees return to their roots, life’s mechanism withdraws—here lies the benevolence of Heaven and Earth, not the killing of the mundane world. It is also said: “Blessing arises from harm.” This too reveals the intent of Heaven and Earth, not the harm of the mundane world.\n\nSixth in severing obstructions: do not arouse mundane emotions. The Great Dao is without action; worldly perceptions and knowledge are not employed. The slightest activation of mundane intent leads to endless error.\n\nSeventh in severing obstructions: do not arouse mundane thoughts. The mechanism of the Great Dao requires all thoughts to be purified. The slightest trace of worldly thinking brings boundless harm.\n\nEighth in severing obstructions: do not arouse dullness or defilement. The Dao is fundamentally pure and luminous, free from contamination. The slightest touch of dullness or worldly filth loses one’s utmost truth.\n\nThe Dao is without sound or scent. To seek it through sound or form is to distance oneself from the Dao. Those who embody the Dao are not only unobstructed by external sounds and forms, untouched by worldly affairs, but also free from all traces and boundaries of the Dao—nothing is sought, nothing is grasped.",

      "translated_text": "Ninth in severing obstructions: do not arouse sound or form. The Dao is fundamentally all-pervading unity. To cling to right or wrong is to lose the primordial truth of the Great Mystery.\n\nTenth in severing obstructions: do not arouse judgments of right and wrong. Though Mencius said, \"The sense of right and wrong is innate in all people,\" the profoundly wise appear foolish—why would they engage in such distinctions? The Dao makes no choices. To harbor love or aversion is to obstruct truth.\n\nEleventh in severing obstructions: regard all with equanimity, without arousing hatred or attachment. Principle is fundamentally undivided; to discriminate with cleverness is to depart from the Dao.\n\nTwelfth in severing obstructions: do not arouse discriminating thoughts. To see the Dao clearly is to rise above the dust of the world, disdaining worldly concerns. Yet to harbor arrogance even once is to greatly deviate from the Dao.\n\nThirteenth in severing obstructions: do not arouse thoughts of self-importance or disdain. The Great Dao is lively and free, utterly beyond attainment. Sever these thirteen obstructions, and the Dao is attained. Though called \"attaining the Dao,\" in truth there is nothing attained. The slightest grasping or attachment means principle’s obstruction remains unremoved, and one is bound by dharma.\n\nFourteenth and final in severing obstructions: do not arouse attachment. As this fool observes: the Dao within humans is inherently unobstructed. Only when the world’s affairs and principles obscure it does one lose the Dao. Thus, the Primordial Beginning in compassion revealed this chapter on severing obstructions to the pure assembly, enumerating each point to inspire resolve and unobstructed progress. Shedding the obstructions of worldly affairs and transcending the snares of dharma, one’s luminous countenance before the Jade Emperor will, with one’s wondrous clarity, shine forth in response—what then remains unseen?\n\nYet severing these two obstructions is but the gateway to the Dao. The profound awakening to divine transformation and the profound mystery shall be discussed later.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: Divine Powers**\nConcentrate the spirit and settle the thoughts; all spirits are subdued and harmonized. The mind becomes like the vast emptiness of heaven, inwardly and outwardly pure and unblemished, containing all without exclusion, embracing all without rejection. Let no external deviance disturb this supreme Dao, leading one astray from the true source, corrupting the numinous root, and stealing the supreme treasure. Thus, through countless kalpas, one remains forever mired in the mundane, entangled in the web of the worldly. Myriad demons assail, and for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, one hears not the wondrous dharma. Ghosts and spirits seize the chance to condemn, dragging one from life into death.\n\nTherefore, you must resolve with wholehearted sincerity to guard the true source and prevent its loss. As previously described, you must sever and eliminate all such obstructions. With the body purified, you transcend all difficulties—this is called the treasure of the Dao, the pillar upholding the dharma.\n\nLiu Haichan said: The Primordial Beginning’s teaching on severing obstructions generates great wisdom and cuts off the fourteen karmic tendencies. What is its ultimate aim? When obstructions are severed and obscurations removed, the spirit becomes clear and thoughts serene. One should silently abide in the primordial numinous origin, concentrate the original spirit, and settle all thoughts. All spirits harmonize and subside; the mind becomes like the boundless emptiness of the sky, inwardly and outwardly pure and steadfast. It contains and embraces all beings and phenomena in the dharma realm. With steadfast vision and unwavering resolve, one remains unchanging. Let no external deviance disturb the supreme and perfect Dao, leading one astray from the true and mysterious source, corrupting the wondrous numinous root, and stealing the indestructible and inalienable supreme treasure. Otherwise, through kalpas without end, one remains forever mired in the mundane, thoroughly entangled in the web of worldly dust. Myriad demons of the yin realms assail, and for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, one is deluded by demonic karma, never hearing the most supreme and wondrous dharma. Ghosts and spirits seize the chance to condemn, dragging one from the path of life into the realm of death.\n\nTherefore, all in this dharma assembly must focus with sincere resolve to guard and uphold the original true source, preventing its loss or abandonment. As previously described, you must sever and eliminate all doubts, delusions, and obstructions. The fourteen obstructions, external deviance, life and death—all such matters are encompassed herein. Having severed all obstructions, the body attains true purity, transcending and ascending beyond the three realms, escaping the karmic suffering, disasters, and hardships of cyclic existence. This method of severing obstructions is called the supreme treasure of the Dao, the great pillar upholding the true dharma. Without pillars, pavilions, pagodas, temples, halls, gates, and dwellings cannot be constructed. Without severing obstructions, one cannot complete the Dao, enter sagehood, or transcend the mundane. Severing obstructions prevents ultimate ruin and allows the true dharma to flourish. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy regards severing obstructions as the pillar upholding the dharma.\n\nAs this fool observes: the original spirit of human nature is inherently pure and undefiled, indestructible through countless kalpas. Fond of stillness and harmony, it is ever luminous, no different from the sages and perfected ones. If this luminosity persists without cease, how could the wondrous light of the Jade Emperor’s divine transformation not be personally witnessed? Yet thoughts entangle the mind, and habits persist unchanging. Few understand the Dao, and those who do often seek quick results. Thus, ingrained habits are hard to exhaust, afflictions difficult to relinquish, and the Emperor’s light remains unseen.\n\nOnly with true clarity, profound penetration, utmost vigor, and resolute decisiveness—recognizing the reality of nature and life, discerning the illusory nature of all phenomena—can one first see the Dao and forget things, then practice the Dao and forget people, then attain the Dao and forget the self, then perfect the Dao and forget the mind, then delight in the Dao and forget pursuits. Further, one forgets even the act of forgetting, merging principle and phenomena, transcending both truth and illusion, and no longer dwelling in the boundaries of sage or mundane. What need is there for the five ranks of host and guest? Attainment is no attainment; preservation is no preservation. Emptiness is not emptiness; the unspiritual is spiritual. Thus, past habits are purified, accumulated karma is severed, subtle defilements are extinguished, and one ascends to the supreme. Without need for silent audience before the Emperor, one shares the Emperor’s spirit. Without clinging to the Dao’s naturalness, one unites with the Dao’s truth. What place is there for the three vehicles, or the various ranks? Among sages, one is the most exalted, with unparalleled merit and virtue.\n\nAll can achieve this, but only when the roots and dust are purified, when effort is profound and practice wondrous, when there is non-action and no seeking.",

      "translated_text": "Those who feign attainment surely cannot transcend; when fusion remains incomplete and transformation lacks spiritual power, one’s entry into sagehood is still imperfect—such as earthbound immortals of the Daoist tradition, bodhisattvas of the Buddhist teachings, or the great worthies of the Confucian school. Now, those who seek the Dao must model themselves on the highest sages and not be content with the Great Vehicle alone.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Spiritual Powers**\nOne must further cultivate and revere this scripture, as though drawing near the Emperor, nurturing a heart of reverence and awe. Fix the mind upon the Emperor’s august countenance, extol his sacred name, and only then will you and all others behold his compassionate visage, receive his protection and deliverance, universally hear the wondrous Dharma, personally offer devotion and veneration, and forever escape the cycles of rebirth.\n\nThe Eastern Flower Lord of Wood declared: The Primordial Beginning revealed to the assembly the method for severing obstacles, proclaiming it the treasure of the Dao and the pillar of the Dharma. He further instructed the assembly on the meaning of enduring devotion, saying: \"You, the pure assembly, having heard the true Dharma today, must further cultivate, revere, and uphold this *Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct*. To recite this scripture is to draw near the August Jade Emperor, fostering a heart of reverence, awe, and devotion. Knowing the scripture’s sanctity prevents disrespect toward Heaven’s Dao; recognizing its weight prevents disregard for Heaven’s treasures. Perpetual reverence ensures no defiance or irreverence, and the Great Dao is naturally attained—just as the *Analects* speaks of awe for Heaven’s mandate and awe for the words of sages. Though drawing near the Emperor is not the same as truly beholding the Jade Emperor, if one cannot face him even for a moment, one cannot maintain reverence for even that moment. Fixing the mind upon the Jade Emperor’s august countenance and wondrous form is not merely an act of imagination; it is as though he were truly present, serving the Emperor with clarity. Thus, one’s virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, becoming a supreme sage. Extolling and proclaiming the Emperor’s most sacred names will allow you and the great assembly to behold the Jade Emperor’s radiant, compassionate visage, all receiving his protection and deliverance, universally hearing the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dharma. You will personally offer devotion and veneration to the Emperor and this scripture, forever free from the loss of rebirth and transmigration.\n\nAnother passage states: To see this scripture, hear this wondrous Dharma, and behold the Emperor’s visage, then personally and earnestly revere, venerate, and make offerings, is to forever depart the dust of the mundane and escape the suffering of rebirth and transmigration. Another interpretation holds that the heart will never regress, and further exploration deepens this understanding.\n\nA query arises: The Confucian texts say, \"The spiritual cannot be attained through thought.\" The Daoist scriptures say, \"Spiritual transformation arises without intention, following naturalness.\" The Buddhist scriptures say, \"One who seeks the Tathāgata through form or sound walks the wrong path and cannot see the Thus-Come One.\" Yet here it is said, \"Fix the mind upon the august countenance, extol the sacred name, and only then will you behold the compassionate visage.\" Could the words of the Primordial Beginning and Mysterious Ancestor deceive us? This is not mere mental contemplation or fixation on words and sounds. One’s virtue harmonizes with Heaven, and one’s spirit resonates with the Emperor, merging and forgetting all distinctions. Thus, the ancients said, \"Heaven’s majesty does not depart from the space before one’s face.\" Through reverence and transformation, praise and extolling arise unconsciously—just as the Confucian texts say, \"Speak the words of Yao, act as Yao acted, and you are Yao.\" The Buddhist teachings say, \"The Dharmakāya enters my nature, and my nature unites with the Tathāgata.\" The Daoist scriptures say, \"When spirit unites with the Dao, the Dao and the self become one.\" Only thus can one hear the wondrous Dharma, make offerings, and escape rebirth. If one merely contemplates in the heart or extols with the mouth, failing to return the body, spirit, and life to the Dao, merging the mind with its truth, this cannot be called true veneration—how then can one escape rebirth? To attain ultimate freedom from descent and unchanging permanence, the acts of fixing the mind, extolling, and making offerings must transcend worldly understanding.\n\nThe foolish observe: Human life and nature are endowed by Heaven, and none are without them. Yet, mired in the mundane stream, one sinks into the cycles of rebirth. If one can master the great principles of the world, fully realizing one’s nature, this is true cultivation and reverence for the Jade Emperor’s scripture. To face and serve Heaven is to draw near the Emperor. With utmost care and reverence, serving without transgression, one nurtures a heart of devotion. The body acts as Heaven’s agent, the mouth speaks Heaven’s words, following Heaven without partiality—this is the Emperor’s true governance. Thus, contemplating the Jade Emperor’s countenance, extolling his name, one receives the blessing of beholding his visage. Virtue is one, and every action is auspicious. Fully realizing oneself, others, and all things, participating in transformation and nurturance, returning life and sincerity, embodying form with utmost likeness, utmost sincerity without cease, enduring without end—this is to receive protection and deliverance, universally hear the wondrous Dharma, personally offer devotion and veneration, and forever escape rebirth.\n\nAlas! The Dao within humanity must be sought without departure. The scriptures of the Dao are like paths for the traveler; to tread the great way, how can one not follow this path? This is what Confucius meant by \"How could one not follow the Dao?\" The Primordial Beginning said that the common cannot see the Emperor. Yet those who truly savor this scripture’s meaning will naturally stand shoulder to shoulder with the Jade Emperor.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: Spiritual Powers**\nAt that time, the four assemblies, having heard this teaching, rejoiced and leapt with joy, exclaiming that such wonders had never been before. The Heavenly Official Great Emperor declared: At this moment of expounding the Jade Scripture, the four assemblies of the Dharma gathering heard the Primordial Beginning Dao Ancestor complete the *Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct: Spiritual Powers Chapter* in the Heaven of Subtle Light. They heard of the Emperor’s wondrous birth and growth, his many lifetimes of cultivation, his boundless transformations, his unfathomable merit and virtue, his natural spiritual responses, and the supreme greatness of his Dharma. The jade maidens attending him were transformed from celestial beings. The vast kalpas of the sand realms all depend on this scriptural Dharma. It clarifies the causes of sin and fortune, and one hears the wondrous principles of severing obstacles. The seventeen great radiant lights have their foundation; the cultivation of truth through billions of kalpas has its essentials. Taking the Dharma as one’s model, entering sagehood is effortless. Rejoicing in the shedding of karmic dust and the ease of entering the seven abodes, all were filled with joy and delight, leaping and exulting in unison, praising with one voice.",

      "translated_text": "Here at this Dharma assembly, the most excellent karmic conditions converge—this rare encounter is no mere coincidence. This assembly, this hearing, this Emperor, this scripture, this moment, this teaching—such has never been seen across kalpas past. Some may say that upon hearing this discourse, one should focus solely on the methods of severing demonic obstructions, taking it too narrowly. When the Primordial Dao Ancestor expounded the scripture, the *Divine Transformations Chapter* was concluded—not that after finishing, He spoke again. Though divided into three scrolls and five chapters, it was out of compassionate instruction that the celestial perfected arranged the teachings into three scrolls. To regard the concluding praises of the final scroll as identical to other laudations would be to miss the deeper meaning. Thus, upon hearing this discourse, one must also bear in mind what precedes it. Let the reader examine this carefully.\n\nIn my humble view: The spirit, qi, and blood of the human body obey the celestial sovereign within; the wondrous mind is luminously clear, the celestial melody resounds, harmony flows naturally, and supreme harmony arises spontaneously. Hands dance and feet leap, boundless joy unfolds, and in attaining the Dao, one forgets all scheming—nothing in the world surpasses this. Even the four assemblies who hear this teaching rejoice and exult, marveling at what has never before existed. Yet the world is drowned in profit and desire, few awaken to truth, and those who enter sagehood and achieve perfection are rarely seen. If one hears the scripture and inwardly comprehends it, embodying supreme harmony while mind and spirit merge with transformation, is the Emperor’s work not already within me?\n\n**Examination of Chapter Divisions in the First Scroll**\nWhen the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the *Collected Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct*, the celestial perfected inquired about the origins of the Emperor’s transformations. Though their words differed, all occurred in a single moment—why then was the first scroll divided into thirty-six chapters? The scripture’s exposition unfolded in one instant, but questions and answers varied. Later, unable to fully grasp the scripture’s purport, the profound and mysterious teachings of the supreme sage, the celestial emperors, gods, and perfected—along with the Five Elder Emperor Lords—collated the text, while the Heavenly Strategist continued the compilation afterward. The Wenchang Emperor and the Celestial Pivot Minister each, in their time, offered critical assessments and corrections, designating the first section as *The Divine Transformations Chapter of the Clear Subtlety Heavenly Palace*—no other chapter was so distinguished, for the Emperor’s divine transformations are peerless, His station supreme. This teaching of the Primordial Ancestor is beyond the speech of all immortals and buddhas.\n\nDuring the Han, Wei Boyang; in the Tang, Lü Chunyang; in the Yuan, Qiu Changchun; and in the Ming, Luo Nian’an—all discussed this in great detail, dividing it into chapter annotations. The first scroll’s *Divine Transformations Chapter* thus comprises thirty-six chapters, not arbitrarily dissecting the true words but aligning with the meaning of the thirty-six heavens to establish the divisions. Each demarcation carries intent, the ideas interconnected, preventing fragmentation. If those who recite and study this scripture purify their minds and still their thoughts, embodying the supreme sage’s intent in expounding the scripture and the perfected’s purpose in dividing the chapters, their spirits will resonate with the sagely and true. When the scripture’s vital essence flows uninterrupted, what need is there to distinguish thirty-six chapters? And how could the scripture’s purport remain unattainable?\n\nYet those who cling to the text are many, while those who inwardly comprehend without tiring are few. Some dismiss the scripture as useless, others seize upon a single phrase as extraordinary, or fixate on a single character as flawed. They distinguish between *Lingbao* and *Gaoshang* in name only, failing to listen with the heart and grasp the wondrous communion of the spirit. Thus, through the scripture, they cannot awaken to the Dao, instead becoming ensnared by the obstacle of words—this is the gravest delusion.\n\nAlas! The ultimate teachings of all scriptures are the seal of the mind. Through words, one perceives the Dao; having attained the Dao, one forgets words. The profound and hidden discourses are all the inherent principles within us—why doubt their difficulty or, worse, disparage them lightly? A single moment of attainment should not breed complacency. These prefatory and concluding remarks are appended as a warning to scholars.\n\n**Commentary on the Imperial Scripture, Scroll Four**\n*End of the First Scroll’s Thirty-Six Chapters*\n\n**Collected Commentaries on the Imperial Scripture, Scroll Five**",

      "translated_text": "**The Orthodox Transmission of the Daoist Canon, Continued Daoist Canon**\n\n**The Highest Emperor’s Original Acts Scripture, Scroll Two**\n\nFrom the preceding scroll’s *Divine Powers Chapter* to the sacred transformations of the Heavenly Officials. The sagely and true of the Three Teachings are all beyond easy attainment, hence this is listed first to show the origin of the divine transformations in this true scripture.\n\nThis section begins with the *Divine Incantations Chapter*, for the scripture contains secret dharma-words. They can deliver humans and record immortals, restrain stars, subdue demons, govern waters, pacify the five directions, and succor the dharma-realm—thus they are called \"divine incantations.\" Following the divine powers with their secret dharma-words and esoteric texts, such benefits place this as the second chapter.\n\n**The Great Illuminating Perfect Radiance Divine Incantations Chapter, Second**\n*Divine Incantations Chapter, First Section*\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Ancestor of Heaven and Earth, the Five Elder Thearchs, bowed their heads and knelt in reverence, addressing the Heavenly Venerable:\n\n\"We have heard that the Highest Jade Emperor, in great compassion for sentient beings, universally emits divine radiance, illuminating the dharma-realm. The six realms of the ordinary and the four ranks of the sagely all partake of the blessings of the Dao’s shelter.\n\nWe humbly consider that the lifespan of ordinary beings is brief, and the kalpa’s destiny nears its end. The true Dao ought to be propagated to deliver the multitudes, allowing those who cultivate reality to have a time for light ascent, and the people of the latter age to all attain longevity.\n\nAt that time, when the Primordial Heavenly Venerable had finished expounding the *Divine Powers Chapter*, the Primordial Ancestor of Heaven and Earth’s inception, the Five Directions’ Five Spirits, and the Five Elder Thearchs bowed their heads in obeisance, prostrated in reverence, and addressed the Primordial Heavenly Venerable:\n\n'We have heard that the Highest Jade Emperor, in great mercy, pities the sentient beings of the world, universally emitting the great divine powers of boundless true radiance, illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds, all heavens and earths, and every dharma-realm. The six kinds of ordinary beings—heavenly, human, demonic, hellish, hungry ghosts, and animals—as well as the four ranks of the sagely—those of the supreme vehicle, and the upper, middle, and lower vehicles, the immortals, buddhas, spirits, and aspirants—all universally partake of the blessings of the great Dao’s compassionate radiance.\n\nWe humbly consider that ordinary beings are short-lived, the world’s span is fleeting, and the kalpa’s destiny in the dharma-realm nears its end. The true Dao of immortals ought to be transmitted and practiced to deliver the billions of people, allowing those who aspire to immortality and cultivate reality to have a time for liberation, attaining lightness of body and ascension, while the people of the latter age suffer no premature death and all attain longevity.\n\nYet human life in the world has a fixed destiny, and the sages of the Three Teachings all shed their bones in the dust. Yanzi, the great worthy, died at thirty-two. Though the *August Scripture* brings benefits, how can it defy the great workings of creation and grant humans immortality?'\n\nThis is not so. The human body may die, but the principle of human life does not perish. If the Dao is not understood, though one lives in the world, the heart is already dead—merely clinging to life in cowardice, how can this be called longevity? If one comprehends the Dao, awakens thoroughly, and completes practice, returning to emptiness and transcending transformation, then to hear the Dao in the morning and die by evening leaves no regret—this is true longevity.\n\nThus the *Dao De Jing* states: 'That which dies yet does not perish is longevity.' Confucius said: 'Human life is upright.' He also said: 'The humane are long-lived.' The Buddhist scriptures say: 'If one fully realizes nirvana, one sees the Tathagata—this is called the indestructible vajra.'\n\nThe perfected of the Three Teachings do not regard death as death, but ignorance of the Dao as death; they do not regard life as life, but realization of the Dao as life. Though the workings of creation make birth and death inescapable, they may bind ordinary people but cannot bind the sages.\n\nThe *August Scripture of the Jade Emperor* was expounded by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable as the supreme vehicle’s wondrous dharma, the true essence of the Three Teachings, the profound secret of the myriad methods, the compassionate vessel of the dharma-realm, the crucial gate of life and death, the esoteric meaning of formation, duration, decay, and emptiness, the pivot of kalpas’ turning, the broad path of transcendence and realization, the wondrous means of delivering the world, and the bridge for untying knots and removing transgressions.\n\nIf the Most Venerable compassionately expounds this scripture, once the multitudes receive the sagely grace and rely on the power of divine radiance, all may return to the true dharma, avoid deviant paths, and face life and death without shame. It can grant short-lived beings long life—such is the divine efficacy of this scripture.\"\n\n*Seal of the sound, yin.* (蒸 is interchangeable with 烝.)",

      "translated_text": "At the kalpa’s end when the final age draws near,\nthe *Divine Incantations* chapter two:\n\nFrom of old, the *Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Vermilion Script Jade Chapters True Writ* arose before the Primordial Beginning, within the empty void—ere heaven and earth took root, ere sun and moon shone forth, in profound obscurity, without ancestor or lineage, without qi or image, without color or name, without form or trace, without sound or voice, in the chaos of the Great Nonbeing. The numinous writ, veiled in dim haze, flickered in and out of existence, now present, now absent. Yet when the numinous diagram unfolded and transformation began, when the mysterious signs shifted and qi congealed to float in the void, riding the turning of the mechanism to meet its destined moment, the *Jade Emperor’s True Teachings*, the *Numinous Treasure Secret Scripts*, and the inconceivable, supreme divine incantations came into being.\n\nThe Five Venerable Lords, Ancestors of Heaven and Earth, declared that the true Dao of the *August Emperor’s Venerable Scripture* could grant longevity to the multitudes of the final age—how did it come to possess such vast efficacy?\n\nFrom of old, the *Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Great Vermilion Celestial Writ*’s true writ of azure jade and jasper chapters arose before the dharma-realm was established, before the Primordial Beginning’s original inception, within the vast emptiness of the Great Void—ere the Two Modes had divided, ere the Supreme Ultimate or Non-Ultimate, ere heaven and earth had laid their foundations, ere yin and yang, water and fire had begun their gestation, ere sun and moon had cast their light. Vast and indistinct, how could one discern its divisions? Only profound obscurity reigned. The myriad forms had not yet arisen—what could precede them? The origin of creation was unseen; it was without ancestor or lineage. In the mysterious emptiness of the Great Void, no qi was visible, no forms or images existed, no colors to be perceived, no names to be uttered, no shapes or shadows, no beginnings or ends, no echoes or traces. Silent and desolate, what sounds or voices could there be? Boundless and infinite, it was the chaos of the Great Nonbeing.\n\nThe true writ of the *Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Vermilion Script Jade Chapters*, its numinous and secret radiance, though veiled in dimness and not clearly seen, yet faintly revealed its traces—now present, now absent, neither existent nor nonexistent, neither being nor nonbeing, existing yet never truly existing, nonexistent yet never truly nonexistent.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning’s numinous workings unfolded the mysterious diagram, opening the myriad transformations. The wondrous signs of the mysterious origin shifted and turned, congealing the subtle qi of Brahma to pervade the empty void, riding the mechanism of the mysterious workings to meet the destined moment when the true Dao should spread its blessings upon heaven and humankind. The *Jade Emperor’s Precious Teachings*, the *Numinous Treasure’s Secret Celestial Scripts*, and their immeasurable, inconceivable supreme virtues—these divine incantations then manifested their secrets and took form, and the wondrous dharma came into being.\n\nThe Vermilion Script, the true writ of the *Jade Emperor’s Venerable Scripture* and the wondrous existence, was all formed from the primordial Brahma-qi of the heavens. Its characters spanned a *zhang* in length, their crimson light resplendent, written in great vermilion gold upon jade chapters in the Cinnabar Heaven. Above the Nine Heavens, all were azure-jade chapters, the writ of the *Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure*. Their radiance like precious rosy clouds, their luster like jade—hence called the *Jade Chapters*.\n\nThey arose before the Primordial Beginning, before the original inception of heaven and earth—not before the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. \"Ere heaven and earth took root\" does not mean heaven and earth lacked a generative root; rather, heaven and earth were born from the formless. The Primordial Beginning’s true writ existed before the Three Thousand Great Worlds were established, before the beginning of kalpas. Thus, ere the root of heaven and earth’s division was seen, it flickered in and out of existence—present yet its form undefinable, absent yet its truth never extinguished.\n\nThe *Jade Emperor’s True Speech* and the *August Scripture’s* wondrous canon bring boundless compassion, enduring through kalpas without measure, pervading the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds without end. All heavens uphold it; the Three Teachings revere and follow it—it is the decree of the kalpa-turning dharma-realm.\n\nThe *Numinous Treasure Secret Scripts*, the celestial cloud-script, are not easily encountered or perceived, beyond conception or discourse, beyond the reach of thought or speech. Thus they came into being.\n\nThe true writ of the *Jade Scripture* existed before the kalpas—it did not arise only now, nor did it await the destined moment of its revelation. The Dao embraces the Great Void—what form could it have? Who could perceive it? Though present, none knew of its presence. Now, as the true Dao spreads its rightful course, the numinous writ reveals its secrets, its divine radiance shining forth in brilliance. Thus it is said to have come into being at this time. The presence of the true scripture’s wondrous dharma, meeting its destined moment, is a rare and fleeting occasion. Those who encounter this gathering—how could they bear to neglect it and not seek the teachings?\n\n*Divine Incantations* chapter three:\n\nThus, heaven and earth received it and divided; the Three Luminaries received it and shone forth. The numinous writ flourished in splendor, illuminating the Highest Clarity, emanating from the Celestial Beginning of Azure, its colors unbounded, its patterns intricate and winding, difficult to trace in detail.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning refined it in the Cavern of Yang, forged it in the Courtyard of Flowing Fire. The resonant tones preceded its true text, its brilliance gleaming forth. As the Cavern of Yang’s qi was crimson, it was named the *Vermilion Script*. Once the numinous diagram shone forth, the Five Emperors paid homage to the true, soaring through the void, circling the Upper Palace, burning incense and scattering flowers, chanting the numinous verses.\n\nAt that time, heaven manifested twelve mysterious omens, earth produced twenty-four responses. Above, the Nine Heavens’ numinous mysteries were celebrated; the Three Heavens’ precious radiance was praised. The divine winds stirred, and the August Dao flowed unimpeded.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning issued the decree; the Perfected of Great Purity took up the brush. The Jade Consort swept the mat; gold was cast into tablets, jade carved into script. The Five Venerable Lords recorded it, sealing it in the Celestial Capital’s numinous palace. Jade maidens tended the incense; the Great Flower held the cloth. Golden lads stood guard; jade steps led to the celestial hall. The Nine Heavens’ jade script was not for ghosts or spirits to hear—only the true writ of the *Jade Scripture* and the *Numinous Treasure Secret Scripts* came into being at this time.\n\nThus, the Supreme Ultimate gave birth to the Two Modes: the pure floated to become Heaven, the turbid congealed to become Earth. Heaven and earth received it and divided. The sun’s brilliance shone, the moon displayed its splendor, the stars arrayed themselves—the Three Luminaries received it and shone forth.",

      "translated_text": "The true scriptures and numinous writs, dense with their auspicious radiance and luminous qi, shone resplendently, illuminating the Upper Clarity’s realms. They emanated from the Primordial Azure’s supreme heavens, their hues unbound by fixed form or place. The radiant might of these numinous writs filled every winding path, their depths too profound for tracing or fathoming.\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy refined these true writs in the Cavernous Yang’s Double Mystery Hall, smelting this scripture in the Flowing Fire’s Great Brahmā Court. He purified their orthodox text, their brilliance boundless. He clarified their great, correct, wondrous, and existent writs, causing them to gleam and surge with luminous splendor. The Cavernous Yang’s wondrous qi overflowed with cinnabar radiance, purely crimson—thus named the *Crimson Writs*. The numinous destiny’s mysterious charts, now resplendent with light, drew the Five Thearchs to pay homage at the Origin. The Perfected rode clouds and auspicious omens, soaring through empty space, circling the supreme palaces in ritual procession. They burned the pure and spontaneous true incense, scattered celestial blossoms, and chanted the numinous writs’ precious chapters.\n\nAt that time, Heaven did not withhold the Dao, and the primal celestial bodies offered auspicious signs—twelve mysterious omens appeared in the heavens. Earth did not withhold its treasures, and the twenty-four qi manifested in their purest form, revealing twenty-four terrestrial responses. Above, the nine heavens’ numinous writs’ profound meanings were celebrated; the three heavens’ precious chapters were extolled. The wondrous canon shone brilliantly, its divine teachings spreading like the wind. The mechanism for delivering the world was set in motion, the imperial Dao flourished universally, and the great Dharma universally bestowed its blessings upon all.\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy ascended his throne and bestowed his mandate. The Supreme Perfected and transcendents held brushes to inscribe it. Jade consorts and numinous consorts swept the ritual mats. Indestructible golden light was cast into mysterious tablets and secret writs; azure jade’s mystic radiance was carved into cinnabar script. The Five Directions’ Five Numinous Ones and Five Venerable Lords recorded and transmitted it, sealing it in the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Numinous Mysterious Capital’s halls. Jade maidens tended the celestial incense; the Great Flower Perfected held the mystic cloth. Golden lads stood in attendance, guarding the jasper steps that led to the celestial halls. The Nine Heavens’ jade graphs and cinnabar script—these were not for any ghost or spirit to hear.\n\nOnly after Heaven and Earth existed did written characters come to be, and the scriptures were transmitted. Yet now it is said that the *August Scripture* existed before Heaven and Earth divided. Many who hear this grow doubtful and confused. Yet the Dao’s spontaneity, its ceaseless mutual succession, is what makes it true writ; the Dao’s indestructibility is what makes it true scripture. The Primordial existed before the kalpas’ vastness, and the *August Scripture*’s principle was already present. The true writ has no characters, its wondrous transformations are inexhaustible. Thus, Heaven and Earth divided from this, and the Three Luminaries shone forth from this. This is the true principle—what doubt remains?\n\nThe text’s winding structure has led some to misread characters as phonetic loans, but this is incorrect. The phrase \"purified their orthodox text\" has been misconstrued as \"explained their orthodox text,\" but this is wrong. *Ying* (莹) is pronounced like *ying* (盈), not read as *xun* (巽) or *xin* (信). The mysterious scripture has no form—how could it be called \"golden tablets\"? Yet the mysterious light’s wondrous image endures beyond kalpas without destruction, hence it is called \"golden tablets and jade script.\" The mysterious writ’s radiant auspiciousness, its lustrous dignity, is thus called \"jade script.\" \"Not for any ghost or spirit to hear\"—the *August Scripture*’s profound mystery is unknown to ghosts and spirits, for it is not an ordinary hearing, nor an easy hearing, nor a hearing within the capacity of the common.\n\nThe *Divine Incantations* in four chapters:\nThus, Heaven treasures it to attain purity, Earth secretes it to attain tranquility, the Five Thearchs wield it to attain numinosity, the Three Luminaries ride it to attain brilliance, the supreme sages uphold it to attain the divine, the lofty spirits revere it to attain the true, the Five Marchmounts follow it to attain stability, the Son of Heaven obtains it to attain governance, and the dynastic mandate relies on it to attain peace. Truly, it is the wondrous power of the *Numinous Treasure*, the mysterious root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIts majestic numinosity is vast and boundless, universally bestowing its inexhaustible blessings. The great transformation is expansive and unobstructed, the origin of all divine luminaries. Its measure is unfathomable, towering like the great void. At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy transformed the era of primordial chaos. Mystic images unfolded in the numinous charts; the numinous writs flourished in radiant splendor. They distinguished the workings of positions and transformations, manifesting the divine in the Five Directions—east, west, south, north, and center—dividing above as Heaven and below as Earth, opening and transforming the Dharma-realm’s myriad numinous beings and all species. This is the Double Mystery’s true and secret treasure—might one briefly glimpse its numinous essence through the imperial teachings, unfolding the supreme true and secret origin?\n\nThus, Heaven’s position is above, and by treasuring this true scripture, it attains the True One and achieves eternal purity. Earth’s position is below, and by secretly upholding this true scripture, it attains the True One and achieves eternal tranquility. The Five Directions’ Five Thearchs wield this secret writ to attain divine transformations and become the Five Numinous Ones. The sun, moon, and stars—the Three Luminaries—ride this true scripture’s wondrous Dharma to ascend in lofty brilliance. The supreme sages and perfected ones uphold this true scripture to attain a sageliness beyond comprehension and ascend in divine loftiness. The divine departments revere this true scripture to attain the true and sagely positions. The Five Marchmounts’ sacred thearchs, through this true scripture’s power, remain unshaken and attain secure stability. The Son of Heaven who rules all under Heaven obtains this true scripture’s wondrous Dharma to achieve governance without care. The nation’s mandate and enterprise rely on this true scripture to attain peaceful rule.\n\nTruly, it is the wondrous power of the *Numinous Treasure*’s true origin, the mysterious root of Heaven and Earth’s true origin. This scripture’s celestial majesty and numinous efficacy are vast beyond measure, boundless and without limit. Across the kalpas’ vastness and the Dharma-realm, all benefits are inexhaustible. Universally bestowed without end, its transformations are vast and unobstructed, its merit and influence formless and boundless. Truly, it is the great and immeasurable divine transformation, the true origin of all divine luminaries—its merit and measure are beyond all reckoning. Without form or origin, towering and unattainable like the great void.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy transformed the era of primordial chaos. Mystic light’s wondrous images unfolded the numinous charts; the numinous writs flourished in radiant splendor. They distinguished the workings of positions and transformations, manifesting the divine in the Five Directions—east, west, south, north, and center—dividing above as Heaven and below as Earth, opening and transforming the Dharma-realm’s myriad numinous beings and all species. This Double Mystery’s true and secret treasure—might one briefly glimpse its numinous essence through the imperial teachings, unfolding the supreme true and secret origin?",

Heaven and earth received it and divided. The sun’s brilliance shone, the moon displayed its splendor, the stars arrayed themselves—the Three Luminaries received it and shone forth.",

      "translated_text": "Unfolding—alternatively rendered as \"perusing.\" The imperial scriptures are Daoist parlance, originally for cultivating and verifying immortal ranks, not for governing equitably or achieving universal peace. Yet here it speaks of the Son of Heaven attaining governance through them, and the nation’s fortune relying on them to achieve peace—why? For only when the Dao transforms and completes does governance and peace arise. Awakening to the true origin and illuminating the great Dao, one gains trust without speech, transformation without action, and accomplishment without striving. When virtue flourishes, its transformative power becomes divine, eternally benefiting all without limit. Thus it is said: governance is achieved, and governance is made equitable. Wondrous virtue is fundamentally without attainment, without visible bestowal, yet its transformative efficacy is boundless—hence it is called \"wondrous virtue.\"\n\nAs for the Mystic Root: all roots possess form, yet when the Dao generates Heaven and Earth, though it encompasses the Limitless, the Supreme Ultimate’s diagram of the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth) originates from what is itself without form. The true cannot be seen, cannot be spoken, and diagrams are but provisional images to instruct people. What tangible form does the root of Heaven and Earth possess? Though without tangible form, its cyclical revolutions are inexhaustible—thus it is called the Mystic Root. Its numinous might: the sages and deities of the Three Teachings dare not slight it, for its wondrous transformations are boundless—hence it is called \"numinous might.\" The origin of divine luminaries: all sages take it as their foundational method. It is also said: the thousand spirits and myriad sages emerge from this. The great void: its beginning unseen, its end unseen, indistinct and formless—hence it is called the great void. \"Revolutionizing the era\": some say it refers to the revolution of an ending era, but this is incorrect. This scripture existed before the vast kalpas, and thus it revolutionizes the era of primordial chaos.\n\n\"Manifesting the divine in the Five Directions\": in primordial chaos, there was no distinction, yet the Dao’s wondrous transformations differentiated positions, distinguishing inner and outer—hence it is said \"manifesting the divine in the Five Directions.\"\n\n**Chapter Five of the Divine Incantations**\nNow, as the imperial Dao flourishes and spreads, its blessings extend to the ten directions. Gazing upon the kalpic cycles and cosmic currents, the true wind of the Dao ought to be propagated. Your servant’s heart truly desires that the numinous shade of the Dao may reach the eight farthest reaches, its beneficent breeze perfuming the orchid groves, so that withered branches, long devoid of vitality, may lift their heads in hope of the luxuriance of the Southern Marchmount, and decayed remains may receive the life-giving moisture of the Dao’s profound and arcane teachings. The *Luminous Perfected* sets forth its standards—today, these must be enacted in the world. Looking up to the Primordial Compassion and prostrating below in sincere entreaty, I only pray for Your mercy to turn toward the teeming masses.\n\nI wonder: might the *True Writs of the Numinous Treasure Jade Chapters* be granted for revelation, to be taught to those who have not yet heard? The treasure of the Mystic Origin—I hope to briefly glimpse its numinous essence. Now, as the great Dao spreads and flourishes, its compassionate grace permeates the four cardinal and four intermediate directions, reaching from the highest to the lowest, its blessings extending to the ten directions. Gazing upon the kalpic cycles and cosmic currents, the true wind of the proper Dao ought to be advanced. Your servant’s heart truly desires that the blessings of the Numinous Treasure Dharma may overshadow all worlds in every direction, reaching even the eight farthest reaches. May the Dao’s beneficent breeze and transformative grace bathe the orchid groves and fragrant jewel gardens. May all beings in the world—those mired in stagnation, adherents of heterodox paths, demonic and external cults, the sentient and insentient, those who have not heard the proper Dao—all receive the deliverance of the true scriptures. Like withered branches long devoid of vitality, may they lift their heads in hope of the warmth and moisture of the Southern Marchmount’s luxuriance, their withered forms revived and made flourishing. May decayed remains receive the life-giving moisture of the profound and arcane teachings of the sacred writs. The *Luminous Perfected* Transcendent Lords possess the golden standards for delivering the world—today, these must be enacted in the world. Looking up to the Primordial Beginning’s great compassion and prostrating below in sincere entreaty, I only pray that the sagely compassion may turn toward the teeming masses.\n\nI wonder: might the *True Writs of the Numinous Treasure Jade Chapters* be granted for revelation in the world, to be taught to those who have not yet heard?\n\nThe ten directions: not merely the small ten directions of this realm, but the ten directions encompassing the three thousand great thousand worlds. The kalpic cycles: from kalpa to kalpa, endlessly revolving, this true governance of the world persists through every kalpa, not merely one kalpa or one era. The eight farthest reaches: the utmost distances of the three thousand great thousand worlds, not merely the eight directions visible before us. The orchid groves: fragrant jewel gardens. Heaven, Earth, and all beings possess this proper principle, and all have these groves. Yet beings, deluded, do not perceive them. The supreme perfected transcendent sages—these groves radiate their jewel-like splendor. The beneficent breeze: its grace suffuses these groves, its blessings extending to all without limit. The withered branches: beings—humans, spirits, and ghosts—who do not comprehend the proper Dharma are like deadwood. Upon hearing the true scriptures and awakening, they are like withered trees reviving. The decayed remains: beings who do not know the proper Dao, though alive, are as if dead. Upon hearing the true scriptures and transcending, even their desiccated bones are reborn. The life-giving moisture of the profound and arcane: the moisture that nourishes and revives. The *Luminous Perfected*: the Perfected Lords ennobled by the Jade Emperor. Sincere entreaty: exhausting the depths of one’s sincerity in earnest supplication to the Most Sagely. The teeming masses: those with dark hair turning white in old age, their color ashen and uncertain—hence called \"teeming.\" It is also said: the people born of the azure heavens. It is also said: the teeming masses are the multitudes. The Numinous Treasure: the Jade Chapters, the True Writs—all explained previously. \"Granted for revelation\": entreating the Heavenly Worthy to transmit these scriptures, to teach them to all spirits, humans, ghosts, and beings in the Dharma-realm, delivering those who have not yet heard them. \"Might they be granted for revelation to those who have not heard?\"—this is a humble and tentative phrasing, not presuming to assert definitively, for fear that the Most Revered and Wondrous Dharma may not be easily transmitted. Thus, the entreaty is made first, couched in tentative language, to convey the urgency of the request and the utmost reverence.\n\n**Chapter Six of the Divine Incantations**\nThereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy stroked the armrest, raised His voice, and entered profound contemplation, gazing afar. Perceiving the time had come, He universally addressed the assembly of all true sages and saints, deliberating on yin and yang, calculating the convergences of kalpas, adjusting the reckonings of the River Source, inspecting the celestial measures, selecting the seed-people, pointing to the Supreme Non-Being, and whistling to illuminate the Nine Mysteries. Though He did not open His ears to their petitions, it was as if barriers obstructed the path to seeking the true.\n\nAt that time, the Five Elder Thearchs repeatedly posed their questions. After a long while, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy deigned to cast His gaze upon them and, with a sigh, exclaimed: \"How subtle and profound! What you now inquire—is it not excellent? This is the Mystic Root of the Primordial Numinous Treasure, the true writs of the empty and spontaneous, which generate Heaven and establish Earth, open and transform the divine luminaries, bestow stability upon the Five Marchmounts, and bring peace and well-being to the nation and its people.\"",

      "translated_text": "The numinous treasure’s profound mystery stands as the most exalted of all things, with celestial omens and numinous responses arising spontaneously. The *True Writs of the Numinous Treasure* ought to be bestowed as teachings to those yet unenlightened.\n\nAt that moment, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy caressed the jade table before Him, seated upon His precious throne, His majestic Dao-body towering and unbowed. In silent concentration of the utmost truth, He silently unfurled His boundless wisdom, gazing afar into past, present, and future. Perceiving that the time for universal deliverance had arrived, He prepared for this grand convergence, where the six conditions aligned, and all dharma-realms awaited this auspicious moment. All worlds’ celestial perfected and sagely beings deliberated upon the convergence of yin and yang, the cyclical renewal of the primordial, the reckoning of the natural rhythms of generation and transformation, the great and lesser kalpas and cosmic epochs. They adjusted the measures of the River Source’s Water Thearch, examined and recorded the celestial reckonings, selected those of good karmic seed and virtuous cultivation, pointed to the Supreme Non-Being, and chanted the ninefold mysterious verses in luminous recitation.\n\nMindful of the Five Elder Thearchs’ earnest pleas for the transmission of the Dharma, He knew that to withhold His compassionate assent would be as if sealing off the path to cultivating the Dao and seeking the true. At that time, the Five Elder Thearchs persisted in their supplications without cease. After a long while, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy at last unveiled His merciful countenance, His sacred gaze descending in illumination. With a sigh, He exclaimed: \"How subtle and wondrous! How abysmally profound! Is not the question you now pose most excellent? This is the Mystic Root of the Primordial Numinous Treasure, the true writs of the wondrous transformations of the empty and spontaneous. They give birth to the Qian Heaven and establish the Kun Earth, open and transform all worlds’ sagely and numinous beings, stabilize the Five Marchmounts—East Tai, South Heng (also called Heng), West Hua, North Heng, and Central Song—bring peace to successive dynasties, and ensure the well-being of all dharma-realm beings.\n\nThe profound subtlety of the Numinous Treasure is most exalted among all things. Heaven manifests mysterious auspices, Earth emits felicitous omens, and all numinous responses arise naturally. *Caressing the table* refers to leaning upon the jade table of mysterious transformation, no ordinary desk. *Towering and unbowed* does not imply arrogance but describes His majestic Dao-body, the towering and immovable model of the mysterious. *Gazing afar* is sometimes mistakenly written as *thought*, but this is incorrect. *Deliberating upon yin and yang, reckoning kalpas and epochs*—the perfected and sagely are not bound by numbers. The Great Dao cannot be lightly transmitted; its timing is spontaneous.

      "translated_text": "Should one write it as *zhěng*, that too is incorrect.\n\nThe Three Heavens refer to the heavens of the Three Qi—Azure, Crimson, and Yu-Yu. The Six Heavens encompass the realms of Desire, Form, Formlessness, Light Dust, Subtle Dust, Light Defilement, and Subtle Defilement.\n\nThe Celestial Emperors, divine beings, and perfected humans expound the teachings of the Great, Middle, and Lesser Vehicles, each according to their rank in the Dao and their practice. They intersperse minor methods, offering guidance and deliverance.\n\nThere are thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao, for the human body contains thirty-six thousand spirits and qi, varying in purity and strength. Some possess right faith, others hold heterodox views; their root capacities differ, and through learning, they attain what aligns with their nature. Thus, there are the Great Vehicle and the Lesser Vehicle—hence the thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao.\n\nThis is to dispel the doubts of those who come seeking, responding to the inclinations of those who pursue the Dao. Some say it means aligning with the aspirations of seekers, each receiving and upholding what they believe in and resonate with. Those who attain enlightenment speak of it as melting like ice—this is the meaning of *shì* (释), without doubt. To write it as *zé* (择) is incorrect.\n\nThe Three Dragons refer to the beginning, middle, and end of the Dragon Han kalpa. Another account names them Dragon Han, Dragon Kang, and Dragon Zheng. When the miscellaneous qi are universally dispelled, the times grow peaceful, and demonic vapors subside.\n\nThe Celestial Assemblies are auspicious gatherings of all heavens. Another interpretation calls them joyous Dharma assemblies of the heavens.\n\nThe statutes and Celestial Laws bear natural prohibitions. Though the Dao does not select its recipients, to speak of it to the unworthy is to profane the celestial treasure and lose the weight of one’s words. Thus, the sages of the Three Teachings preached only when the time, place, and person were fitting.\n\nThe Golden Tablet and the Mysterious Register are systems for reckoning merit and transgression. To \"observe obeisance before the divine kings\" means to look up to the immortals and perfected ones, and to look down upon the celestial kings and divine marshals.\n\nTo \"govern in unison the heavens of the Primordial Most High’s transforming sovereignty\" means to oversee and administer the heavens transformed by the Primordial Most High. Another interpretation reads *shì* (示) as synonymous with *shì* (视), meaning to demonstrate the proper reverence—looking up and down—before the divine kings, thereby governing the heavens of the Primordial Most High. Both explanations are valid.\n\nTo \"assemble the heavens and draw near in the imperial carriage of the Dao to the supreme heaven of the Primordial Most High\" is also coherent.\n\n**The Eight Chapters of Divine Incantations**\n\nThereupon, the Five Elder Thearchs, together with the perfected sages, bearing pure incense and upholding the precepts, wandered the cloud paths, summoning the ten directions. Ascending to the Supreme Clarity’s Great Mystery Jade Capital, the Hall of Cold Numinosity and Cinnabar Stair, the Supreme Palace of Purple Tenuity, they received the protocols of obeisance. Only then did they recognize the preciousness and solemnity of the celestial perfected, whose teachings are not easily heard. Returning once more before the Dao of the Primordial Most High, they consulted the rites of prohibition and precepts, humbly acknowledging their inadequacy.\n\nAfter listening to the celestial sounds upon the Golden Tablet, they were then enabled to receive the true scriptures and celestial texts.\n\nThereupon, the Five Elder Thearchs of the Five Directions, together with the perfected sages of the heavens, clad in pure incense, upheld the precepts of the Dao, pacing the cloud thoroughfares. They guided and conveyed, lingering and wandering the cloud paths, chanting and proclaiming the decrees to the ten directions’ divine beings. Ascending to the Supreme Clarity’s Great Mystery Jade Capital, the wondrous realm of the celestial palaces, the Hall of Cold Numinosity and Cinnabar Stair, the Supreme Palace of Purple Clarity, they received the protocols of obeisance. Only then did they comprehend the solemn preciousness of the true scriptures and celestial texts, which are not easily heard.\n\nReturning once more before the Dao of the Primordial Most High, they consulted the rites of prohibition and precepts, humbly acknowledging the limitations of their wisdom and insight.\n\nThe \"pure incense\" refers to the incense of true nature, the naturally pure incense of the Dao, the wondrous incense of non-action and right virtue—it is not the burning of worldly incense. To \"uphold the precepts\" means to maintain the solemn and majestic standards of the Mysterious Model, as if standing before the Ancestral Dao. Guarding the precepts of the Celestial Worthy, they wandered in boundless compassion, their radiant Dharma carriage traversing the cloud paths of the ten directions.\n\nThe Confucians of old said, \"The light of heaven and the shadows of clouds wander together\"—this is the meaning. It is not to be compared to the ceaseless coming and going of the mundane world.\n\nTo \"summon the ten directions\" means to issue commands with solemnity, not with whistling or laughter. The character *xiào* (啸) is read as *chì* (勅); to read it as *xiù* (秀) is incorrect. For it denotes the solemn issuance of decrees, not the act of chanting or mirth.\n\nThe \"ten directions\" do not refer to the Ten Numinous Treasures but to the divine hosts of the ten directions. To \"ascend to the immortals and perfected ones\" means to pay homage to the Primordial and receive the Dharma, silently ascending in radiant light to reverently listen to the mysterious teachings—it is not the mundane act of treading upon the steps.\n\nThe Hall of Cold Numinosity is beyond the Nine Heavens, where sound and qi do not reach, where the sun and moon cannot penetrate. The celestial light shines of itself, vast and boundless, pure and coldly solemn. The cinnabar hall gleams with the crimson radiance of great jade—hence its name.\n\nThe Supreme Palace of Purple Tenuity lies above the Purple Empyrean, within the Supreme Clarity’s Great Mystery Heaven—it is not the Purple Tenuity Palace or the Great Tenuity Palace of the mortal world’s celestial asterisms.\n\nThe protocols of obeisance have been explained previously. \"Not easily heard\" does not mean it is difficult to hear immediately but that it is difficult to comprehend upon hearing. Another interpretation holds that the keepers of the scriptures in the Mysterious Capital do not permit immediate hearing, so one must return once more to the presence of the Primordial Most High, ascending again to the Nine Heavens to pay homage to the Supreme Worthy and acknowledge the rites of prohibition and precepts.\n\n*zī* (谘) has been explained previously—it means to inquire about the celestial statutes, prohibitions, precepts, and the rites of transmitting and receiving the Dharma. *jìn* (禁) refers to prohibitions; *jiè* (戒) to precepts.\n\n\"Humbly acknowledging their inadequacy\" does not mean they could not uphold the prohibitions and precepts but is a gesture of humility. Though their bodies were divine and perfected, they had not yet penetrated the treasure of the true scriptures. Upon hearing them at once, their wisdom and insight were insufficient—this is precisely the reverence the Elder Thearchs of Heaven and Earth and the Five Thearchs hold for the Dao and its teachings. It is not self-limitation but an admission of unworthiness to receive them.\n\nAll things under heaven possess principle and may hear the Dao—thus the four numinous creatures each excel in their domain. Humans are the most numinous of the myriad beings, and spirits rank among the finest of the kalpic worlds. How could they be incapable of hearing the Dao?\n\nThus, when Yanzi daily received the teachings of the Master, he did not depart from them, appearing as if foolish, yet rejoicing in understanding. After standing firm, he said, \"Though I wish to follow, there is no way.\" When Mañjuśrī transmitted the true essence of the Buddha’s Dharma to Śākyamuni, those who heard it were filled with awe.",

      "translated_text": "\"Yu (谕) means 'to open and guide.' Some say it should be written as 'harmonious and joyful countenance,' but this is incorrect. The numinous barrier swings wide open. The celestial realm where the scriptures are stored—the cinnabar-spirit and mysterious gate—stands vast and unobstructed, flung open in its entirety. One interpretation holds that the sacred heart is laid bare, the mind opened to reveal sincerity. Another says the sacred eyes stream forth radiance, and the numinous barrier swings wide. Both are valid.\n\n*Deng ming* (登命): To summon and appoint. Here, the Five Elder Thearchs are advanced and brought near to receive the command in person.\n\nThe *Jade Hall of Cavernous Yang* is the *Mystic Hall of the Nine Heavens*—a realm of boundless openness, of eternal brightness without shadow. It is not built of tiles, stone, earth, or wood, but of wondrous scenes of dark radiance, its intricate patterns of coiled script intertwining like jade inscriptions. Hence it is so called.\n\nThe *Nine Lights* have been explained earlier. The *Eight Colors* are: profound azure, profound crimson, profound yellow, profound white, profound black, verdant green, jade green, and purple-gold.\n\n*Yun* (韫) refers to the repository where the scriptures are stored—a place where boundless dark radiance is wholly contained.\n\n*Pi* (披) means 'to open or unfurl.' The *Cloud-Silk Satchel* is woven from the brocade of celestial clouds and mist, a natural manifestation of the Dao’s transforming light, not the handiwork of the Weaver Maid of Heaven. That which has a base is called a *satchel*, and the scriptures are inscribed within it. Its depths are unfathomable to all gods, hence the description. It is not to be compared to the cloth, silk, leather, or hides of the mortal realm.\n\nThe phrases from *Numinous Treasure* through *cosmos* have been explained earlier.\n\n*Great Illumination*: The true scriptures of the Three Teachings are all called *Dharma-Treasures*, and wherever they reside, there is radiance. The scriptures of other teachings have limited light, but this *August Scripture* pervades the three thousand great thousand worlds, its efficacy inexhaustible even after kalpas of time. Thus it is called *Great Illumination*.\n\n*Perfect and Complete*: The sacred heart’s compassion and salvation are boundless. Where power falls short—where there are limits or deficiencies, where the lower realms of the Northern Lu Continent cannot be transformed, nor the beings of the Heaven of Free Mastery—it cannot be called *perfect and complete*. The *August Scripture* encompasses all dharmas, unifies all vehicles, and its transformative power is measureless and inexhaustible. Though it is said that the Dao does not force itself nor clamor insistently, its transformative influence arises naturally. All beings, in their cycles of beginning and end, are ultimately transformed by the Dao.

      "translated_text": "Above, they abide in Heaven, attaining the One to achieve purity—lofty, luminous, and enduring, thus establishing Heaven’s towering clarity. Below, they abide in Earth, attaining the One to achieve tranquility—vast, profound, and enduring, thus establishing Earth’s steadfast constancy. They eternally pacify and secure the Five Peaks and renowned mountains, ensuring the perpetual existence of all myriad beings and their kinds.\n\nThe Dao declares: It is the Five Venerable Thearchs who expound the Dao and offer praises, hence the attribution to the Primordial Jade Sovereign—this is not the Primordial’s self-praise. The wondrous and numinous scriptures mentioned here have all been explained previously.\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Primordial Mysterious Writs* are called \"writs\" as they are inscribed by hand. The *True Scripture of the Jade Sovereign* is formless and soundless, its radiant light and wondrous tones pervading the ten directions and the entire Dharma Realm, enduring through kalpas without decay. It is not something that can be inscribed by hand—all is the spontaneous script; not something that can be transmitted by speech—all is the wondrousness of mind-to-mind transmission. Sought in the beginningless, it exists prior to the formless in the Great Void, hence it is called the *Nine Heavens’ Primordial Mysterious Writs*.\n\nThe *Venerable Canon of the Jade Palace*—the \"palace\" is where the Son of Heaven resides. The Primordial is the supreme honor of all teachings, dwelling in the Sacred Realm of Jade Purity, whose mysterious transformations are inexhaustible, hence it is called the *Jade Palace*. In expounding this true scripture, none of the teachings’ scriptures compare; none of the sages or spirits dare defy it. The celestial statutes and golden registers treasure it most profoundly; the saints of the ten directions guard it most strictly, hence it is called the *Venerable Canon*.\n\nTo \"pacify the spirits\" is to command all spirits to refrain from displaying their numinous powers, remaining serene and non-active. To \"secure the numina\" is to command all numina to conceal their spiritual resonance, restraining their majestic efficacy. To \"uphold and assist the cycles of deliverance\" is to govern the kalpas from beginning to end throughout the Dharma Realm, holding the turning of kalpas and the boundless deliverance, ensuring their cyclical perpetuity without decline or wavering.\n\nTo \"command the earthly deities\" is to issue decrees and edicts—this is not the \"whip\" of coercion. To \"mobilize and employ yin and yang\" means that the Dao truly governs their alternation, hence it is called \"mobilizing and employing\"—this does not refer to commanding yin ghosts or yang spirits. To \"summon the spirits\" is to gather and call forth all spirits. To \"employ the transcendents\"—though transcendents are the guests of the Thearch, why speak of \"employing\" them? When the Primordial expounded this scripture, it became the true essence of the Three Teachings, and all spirits reverently complied, hence it is called \"employing the transcendents.\"\n\nHeaven and Earth may perish, and the myriad kinds may come to an end—how then can it be said that all beings endure? From kalpa to kalpa, generation after generation is inexhaustible, all relying on the Great Dao, hence it is said that all beings endure.\n\n**The Sixteen Chapters of the Divine Incantations**\nwere once bestowed by the Jade Sovereign upon the Five Venerable Thearchs. At that time, the Five Thearchs knelt and reverently held the chapters, secretly inscribing them in the numinous capital. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign once transcribed the text, enshrining it in the Supreme Clarity’s True Realm, the Great Mystery’s Jade Capital, the Cold Numinous Cinnabar Hall, and the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace. Through countless kalpas and cosmic cycles, the text has preserved the celestial root, remaining uncorrupted and undiminished, evolving in tandem with the turning of kalpas.\n\nThis Great Divine Incantation, when confounded, remains unstained; when defiled, grows ever purer. When destroyed, it does not perish; when extinguished, it shines with utmost clarity. The scripture of the Great Existence is revered by the Heavenly Perfected, its true name resplendent with celestial radiance. The Thearch’s chart is inscribed upon golden tablets, illuminating future generations. This scripture is profoundly hidden and secret—ordinary beings cannot glimpse or hear of it. Those who attain this Dao preserve the eternal endurance of the myriad qi. Through diligent practice and devotion, they attain transcendence and ascend to pay homage to the Most Honored Thearch.\n\nTo \"kneel and hold\" is to prostrate and reverently cradle the treasure chapters. The scripture exists in Heaven as a mysterious text, not a worldly one—how then can it be \"held by hand\"? The celestial spirits bow and hold it in utmost reverence. To \"secretly inscribe\" is to praise and transcribe it. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign’s transcription of the scripture consists of celestial radiance and heavenly writ, golden and jade characters forming wondrous texts a *zhang* in length.\n\nThe *True Realm of Supreme Clarity* is the abode of the Numinous Treasure. The scripture was originally expounded by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and transmitted by the Numinous Treasure, hence it is called the *True Realm of Supreme Clarity*. That \"its text preserves the celestial root\" means the principle of the scripture endures through kalpas without decay—it preserves the eternal constancy of the celestial mystery. Some interpret this as preserving the root of Heaven to ensure its perpetuity, but this is incorrect. After the cosmic cycles, Heaven cannot endure eternally, so it cannot refer to the root of Heaven. \"Evolving in tandem with the turning of kalpas\" means it endures through kalpa after kalpa.\n\n\"When confounded, it remains unstained\" means that even when mixed with heterodox teachings, the true Dao persists and cannot taint this scripture. \"When defiled, it grows ever purer\" means that those who profane this scripture are punished by Heaven, revealing its ever-greater sanctity and purity. \"When destroyed, it does not perish\" means that even when foolish and perverse beings slander and destroy this scripture, it remains indestructible. \"When extinguished, it shines with utmost clarity\" means that in an age without the Dao, those who seek to extinguish this scripture will only cause its teachings to spread widely, revealing its ever-greater luminosity.\n\nThe \"scripture of the Great Existence\" endures through kalpas, present everywhere—it is not an ordinary phenomenon but a wondrous existence, hence it is called the *Great Existence*. Some interpret this as the scripture of the *Great Existence* and the *Court*, but this is overly restrictive.",

      "translated_text": "Revealing the future lives, it speaks not of one person’s rebirth but of the myriad lives to come. Those who cannot glimpse or hear of it are not the utmost sages, for common folk merely recite its words. Demons dare not peer into it, and the benighted cannot comprehend it. Those who grasp the principles within this scripture preserve the eternal flow of my myriad *qi*, diligently cultivating and revering it, and thus ascend to immortality, paying homage to the Supreme Emperor. Some say it is homage to the Five Elder Lords, but this is overly restrictive. Another interpretation holds that it preserves the eternal *qi* of the myriad transformations, which is also valid. This speaks to the scripture’s manifest efficacy.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Jade Emperor’s Virtues and Powers**\n*Continuation of the \"Virtues and Powers\" Chapter, Eighteenth Section Following the Previous Seventeen*\n\nAt that time, the Jade Void Emperor addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"I earnestly wish for your compassion to universally benefit the Four Assemblies, Lord Śakra, the Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings, all the devas, all the immortals, and all future beings, as well as those who uphold this scripture, by expounding its beneficial matters.\"\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke to the Jade Void Emperor: \"Excellent indeed is this question! How good it is! You, moved by compassion, take pity on sentient beings and thus inquire of me. You should resume your seat, and I shall proclaim and expound.\"\n\nWhen the Jade Emperor bestowed this scripture upon the Five Elder Lords, the Heavenly Emperor of the Jade Void Heaven ascended to address the Great Heavenly Worthy, Master of Scriptures and Teachings: \"I earnestly wish for your utmost sagely compassion to universally benefit the Four Assemblies of the world, all the deva-kings such as Lord Śakra, the Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings above the Three Realms, all the devas, all ranks of immortals, all future beings, and those who uphold this true scripture, by expounding its beneficial matters.\"\n\nAt that time, the Great Heavenly Worthy, Master of Scriptures, addressed the Jade Void Emperor: \"How joyous indeed is this question! How good it is! You, moved by a heart of compassion, take pity on the beings of the world and thus inquire of me. You should resume your seat, and I shall proclaim and expound the scripture’s meaning.\"\n\nWhen the Heavenly Worthy refers to the Primordial Beginning, it is not the Jade Emperor. The Four Assemblies have been explained previously. Lord Śakra is the lord of the devas, including all buddhas and bodhisattvas of the Buddhist teachings. Some hold that all heavenly lords are called Śakra, which is also correct. If one takes *Śakra* to mean the lord of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, this is a misconception of the Buddhist tradition. The scriptures do not mistakenly refer to the lord of heaven as the Jade Emperor, for the Jade Emperor is the ancestor of the myriad heavens, not merely the lord of a single heaven. The Buddhist scriptures state that Brahmā and Śakra present auspicious signs, speaking of the ancestral figures of heaven and buddhahood, not presuming to mention the Jade Emperor. Monks who indulge in private misinterpretations commit a grave error. Thus, this is mentioned here as well.\n\nThe Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings are the great Brahmā kings above the Three Realms, not the kings of the lower heavens of the Desire Realm. To speak of Brahmā Heaven is to encompass the upper realms. The *zhongmin* heavens and their denizens are not mentioned, for above the *zhongmin* are the perfected great immortals who naturally accord with this scripture, hence they are not included. \"All the devas\" and \"all the immortals\" refer to all the heavenly lords, divine beings, and people, as well as all ranks of immortals below Brahmā Heaven.\n\nThe question of beneficial matters: The Great Dao does not speak of efficacy, so why does the Jade Void Emperor request an explanation of its benefits? The Great Dao is the ancestor of heaven, earth, and all beings, inherently possessing true benefits and natural advantages for humanity. Those among the Four Assemblies of heaven and earth who do not know this scripture are ignorant of its meaning, dare not believe in it, and thus slight the great Dharma, misleading themselves. The Great Dao, in its benevolent compassion, cannot bear the world’s delusion and thus speaks of benefits to deliver beings. How is it that the foolish and deluded still claim this scripture consists of subtle words and abstruse theories, of what benefit is it to people? Do they not know that this scripture gives rise to heaven, earth, and all beings, and cannot be separated from for even a moment? Everywhere, everyone should recite and uphold it, passing it down through kalpas, for it brings great benefits naturally, not merely to entice people with effects.\n\n\"How good it is!\" is not a question but an affirmation of the excellence of the inquiry. \"I\" refers to the Primordial Beginning speaking of himself. \"You\" refers to the Primordial Beginning addressing the Jade Void Emperor. \"Resume your seat\" instructs the Jade Void Emperor to return to his seat for listening to the scripture. \"I\" is also the Primordial Beginning referring to himself. \"Proclaim and expound\" means to broadly disseminate as proclamation and to explain as discourse.\n\n*Fan* (梵) is pronounced *fu* (扶), not mistakenly as *fan* (梵). This expresses the sincerity of the request for the scripture and the heart of universal benefit.\n\n*Continuation of the \"Virtues and Powers\" Chapter, Eighteenth Section*\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"If in the Three Realms, the ten directions, and the boundless lands, warfare erupts, pestilence spreads, floods, droughts, locusts, or dire calamities and famines arise, then the king and his ministers should arouse compassion and, for the sake of their people, issue decrees throughout the land, ordering the governors of provinces, counties, and towns to command all Daoist followers to purify and adorn their oratories. There, they shall hold grand fasts and jiao rites, perform the six-hour circumambulation, and recite this scripture. Thus, the land shall attain peace, the five grains shall ripen abundantly, and the people shall live in tranquility.\"\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy, having instructed the Jade Void Emperor to resume his seat and listen to the scripture, then said: \"If in the Three Realms of heaven, earth, and humanity, the ten directions of the four cardinal and four intermediate directions, and the boundless lands, warfare erupts and weapons clash, or celestial disasters spread and pestilence rages, or years of scarcity bring floods, droughts, locusts, dire calamities, and famine, then the king and his ministers should arouse compassion for their people and issue decrees throughout the land. The governors of provinces, counties, and towns shall command all Daoist followers to purify and adorn their oratories. There, they shall hold grand fasts and jiao rites, perform the six-hour circumambulation, and recite this true scripture. Thus, the land shall attain peace, the five grains shall ripen abundantly, and the people shall live in tranquility.\"\n\nSome say that the Three Realms cannot include heaven, fearing conflict with the term *weapons*. Yet even heavenly demons contend with the lords of the heavens, engaging in battles within their respective domains. Thus, the Three Realms indeed encompass heaven, earth, and humanity.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Daoist lineages—Quanzhen, Zhengyi, Qingwei, Lingbao, and other schools—maintain purity and solemnity, both inwardly and outwardly, with body and mind undivided. Their altars and vestments are impeccably ordered, their reverence and dignity unwavering from beginning to end. Such is their purity and solemnity.\n\n*Guan* (觀) means \"to observe.\" Where the spirit resides, onlookers are moved to reverence—this is truly a grand spectacle. Hence, it is called *guan*.\n\nWhen grand *zhai* (斋) and *jiao* (醮) rites are conducted, inner and outer realms are aligned, the will of the assembly is unified, and what was discordant is harmonized—this is *zhai*. To beseech and give thanks to the deities, repaying Heaven and Earth, aligning one’s virtue with the divine, and invoking blessings according to ritual—this is *jiao*.\n\nThe \"six periods of Dao-recitation\" do not refer to the modern practice of processional recitation along roads, but rather to invoking the deities, reciting scriptures, and chanting the Dao according to ritual. Some say that of the twelve hours of day and night, odd hours are for activity and even hours for stillness. The \"six periods\" correspond to *zi* (子), *yin* (寅), *chen* (辰), *wu* (午), *shen* (申), and *xu* (戌). Others say they span from *zi* to *si* (巳), or refer to the six daylight hours. All interpretations are valid.\n\nWhen scriptures are recited with the heart in union with the Dao, holding fast to the true scripture, the land knows no hardship, and peace prevails. The five grains—rice, millet, sorghum, beans, and wheat—all ripen in abundance, and the black-haired people of every land and realm are spared from disaster and suffering, forever dwelling in tranquility and joy.\n\n**Chapter on Meritorious Virtues (Continuation of Chapter Nineteen)**\nIf one enters the mountains and forests and encounters venomous or ferocious beasts, merely focusing the mind on a single thought of the true scripture will ensure the mountain spirits guard and protect them, causing the fierce beasts to retreat without harm. If one enters rivers or seas to gather treasures or seek precious things and encounters violent winds that threaten to capsize their vessel, reciting this true scripture according to its prescribed method will instantly still the winds and waves, allowing safe passage to shore. The benefits of the true scripture extend beyond averting heavenly disasters, ensuring bountiful harvests, and bringing peace to the common folk. Even sudden calamities—perils of mountains, waters, winds, and waves—can be rendered harmless.\n\nIf one enters the mountains and forests and encounters venomous or ferocious beasts, merely focusing the mind on a single thought of the true scripture, never forgetting this precious and wondrous dharma, will ensure the mountain spirits guard and protect them, causing the fierce beasts to retreat naturally without harming the scripture-holder. If one enters rivers or seas to gather treasures or seek precious objects and encounters violent winds that drift their vessel, reciting this true scripture according to the method prescribed in the scripture will cause the gale to subside, the waves to still, and the vessel to reach shore safely, with no harm befalling the scripture-holder.\n\nMountains and forests are perilous places, where fierce beasts and venomous creatures cannot be approached. Upon encountering them, one is surely harmed. Yet merely focusing the mind on a single thought of the true scripture—briefly uniting with the Dao—causes the beasts to retreat. This is because all living beings originate from the same primordial *qi*, differing only in purity and turbidity. In the beginning, Heaven and Earth were undivided, and humans and creatures coexisted in harmony, with venomous beasts and ferocious creatures posing no threat. Later, human hearts grew cunning, and they began to harm creatures, provoking creatures to harm them in return. If one consistently does good deeds, maintains a virtuous heart, reveres and believes in the true scripture, and never forgets it, they are a great person of virtue. Entering mountains and forests, they will not encounter venomous creatures or fierce beasts. If an ordinary person without merit enters the mountains and happens upon such creatures, not clinging to life in fear of death, remaining unflustered and unwavering, steadfastly believing in the true dharma, focusing single-mindedly, and silently reciting a thought of the true scripture, their heart will unite with the Dao. The mountain spirits will guard and protect them, and the venomous creatures and fierce beasts will naturally retreat.\n\nCreatures are dull beings within the Dao. Though their natures may be venomous and harmful, each has what they revere, fear, and avoid. Thus, birds of prey honor the phoenix, fierce beasts pay homage to the *lin*, and venomous creatures like snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and millipedes fear storks, cranes, and herons, vanishing without deploying their venom. The immortals and perfected ones understand the mechanisms of life and transformation, the origins of control and restraint. A single incantation or talismanic water can subdue venomous snakes, resolve the perils of tigers, reverse winds, and turn back the heavens. How much more so the *Huangjing*, which is the source of all dharmas and the ancestor of Heaven and Earth? The life and death of all things depend on Heaven and Earth, rooted in the Great Dao. Focusing the mind on a single thought of this scripture, one need not fear creatures. The radiance of the dharma-treasure and the protection of the deities ensure that, though creatures may be dull, their nature reveres the Dao, fears Heaven, and stands in awe of the divine, causing them to retreat naturally.\n\nRivers, lakes, seas, and oceans are perilous places of wind and waves, where Heaven’s wrath seems inescapable. Yet this scripture is the king of all dharmas, and wind, thunder, hail, and lightning are the wondrous manifestations of Heaven’s divine power. Reciting this true scripture according to its method unites one with Heaven and the Dao, causing Heaven to soften its might, the winds to subside, and the waves to still, allowing the vessel to reach shore safely.\n\n**Verification:**\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Treading upon a tiger’s tail, it bites the man—misfortune.\" Confucius said: \"Facing a tiger bare-handed or fording a river—dying without regret.\" Yet this scripture says that focusing the mind on a single thought or reciting it according to its method causes creatures to retreat and winds and waves to still. The *Daodejing* states: \"Those who align with the Dao are not seized by birds of prey, stung by venomous creatures, or gored by tigers or rhinoceroses. Their claws and fangs remain sheathed, and they dare not harm.\" Many doubt that Confucianism and Daoism contradict each other, but consider: When Yu crossed the Yangtze, a yellow dragon lifted its head and departed. When Liu Kun governed Jiangling, he reversed the wind to extinguish a fire, and when he governed Hongnong, tigers crossed the river to the north. When Master Yi crossed the river, his reverence stilled the winds. Thus, the *Book of Changes* and Confucius refer to those who act recklessly without the Dao, while the *Huangjing* and *Daodejing* speak of those who honor the scriptures and align with the Dao.",

Some say it refers to grand officials like governors and viceroys. All these interpretations are valid.\n\nThus, \"the king and his ministers\" refers to the kings and ministers of such places.",

In the heat of charge and defense, arrows and stones flying, blades locked in combat like tigers in mortal struggle—no force can break the deadlock. Yet silently reciting this true scripture, aligning the heart with the Dao, how could hostile forces not retreat?\n\nThe art of war states: \"One can break the morale of an entire army; one can shake the resolve of its general.\" Silent recitation of the true scripture seizes their spirits, strips their courage, and through the scripture’s divine efficacy, the enemy loses heart, their will to kill and fight dissolved. Turning from evil to virtue, they retreat and disperse of their own accord.\n\n\"Army\" here does not refer to the fixed number of twelve thousand five hundred, nor does \"formation\" imply a set battle array. It simply denotes the moment when war is joined and ranks are drawn, the clash of attack. The repetition of \"polearms engaged\" and \"blades crossed\" is not redundant; it merely follows the scripture’s phrasing of \"weapons and blades clashing.\" To silently recite the true scripture is not to seek mere escape from slaughter, but to devote oneself wholeheartedly, even unto death, without straying from the Dao.\n\n\"All\" means the multitude; \"hostile forces\" refers not to \"evil people\" and \"bandit factions\" as separate categories, but simply to rebellious enemies. \"Scatter and disperse\" means to retreat and turn back, to disperse and return to their own.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nWhen Lord Lao transformed the Hu barbarians, the kingdom of Yutian besieged him. When the Heavenly Emperor resided in his celestial palace, the demon kings raised armies to contend with him. When the Buddha was in Kapilavastu, the six kings—Ajātaśatru and others—rebelled. When Confucius taught the world, he was barred from gathering firewood in Chen and erased from records in Song. All were great sages, embodiments of the Dao, manifestations of the Dharma-body, constantly reciting the true scripture. Yet they faced those who sought to harm them.\n\nLater, Lord Lao radiated the light of the Dao, and Yutian submitted. The Emperor manifested celestial radiance, and the demon kings withdrew. The Buddha emanated the light of the Dharma, and the six kings returned to allegiance. Confucius shone with the light of virtue, and when he plucked his zither and sang thrice, the men of Kuang laid down their arms. Thus, the enemies retreated of their own accord.\n\nConsider how many bandits have sworn not to harm the virtuous, and how many good people have faced peril yet survived. Some doubt the efficacy of scriptural merit, citing Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong of Song, who honored the Dao yet suffered humiliation in the northern lands, or Emperor Wu of Liang, who revered the Buddha yet starved to death in Taicheng.

      "translated_text": "While the passions and desires remain unsevered, one cannot govern the world through the Dao, hence these calamities arise. If one truly embodies the Dao, steadfastly believing in the power of the scriptures, even a common man or woman may avoid disaster. To doubt the integrity of those who die for righteousness or disbelieve the words of the scriptures is indeed mistaken.\n\nAlas! The praise of unblemished integrity serves to exhort the world; the recounting of scriptural merit serves to inspire people toward goodness. In essence, the scriptures’ purport does not transcend the Dao of one’s own nature and being. When the six thieves of the senses rebel, focusing the mind single-heartedly on the Dao causes the six thieves to withdraw. Thus, when encountering warfare, Heaven resolves the peril. As Lord Lao said: *\"Armor and weapons cannot harm.\"* And Guanyin declared: *\"Blades shatter into fragments of their own accord.\"* Such is the inevitable principle. How could these words deceive us?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One (Continued) of the Meritorious Virtues Section**\nIf one finds oneself in prison or bound by fetters, purify the mind, settle the thoughts, and meditate upon this scripture—wrongful accusations will be redressed, and liberation will be attained. The benefits of this scripture extend far beyond merely causing bandits and soldiers to retreat of their own accord.\n\nIf one has inadvertently committed an offense and is imprisoned or bound in fetters, purify the heart and mind, calm the thoughts, and meditate upon this true scripture—wrongful accusations will naturally be clarified, and liberation will be attained.\n\n**Textual Verification:**\nPrisons are meant to confine the guilty. The principle that virtue brings fortune and vice brings misfortune is the constant Way of Heaven. Once imprisoned for a crime, one cannot be immediately released—how then can it be said that meditating upon this scripture brings liberation? The phrase *\"wrongful accusations will be redressed\"* implies that the person in question must have been inherently good in daily life. Perhaps they bore karmic debts from past lives, or their fate in this life led to misfortune; perhaps they were wrongly implicated by others or ensnared while attempting to rescue someone; or perhaps they were falsely accused due to the misdeeds of the deceased. Once imprisoned, all these cases are wrongful. Without resentment toward Heaven or blame toward others, enduring hardship with equanimity, free from distracting thoughts—this is what it means to purify the mind, settle the thoughts, and meditate upon the true scripture. Heaven aids the fortunate, and wrongful oppression will naturally be cleared without the need for argument. No prolonged struggle is necessary, for there is no principle in the world by which the innocent remain forever oppressed. Liberation comes swiftly.\n\n*\"Prison\"* (牢) refers to the confinement of the guilty; *\"custody\"* (狱) refers to awaiting trial. Today’s prisons, jails, and detention centers vary in severity, but all are places where the guilty are held. The two terms are not fundamentally distinct. Fetters and shackles restrain the guilty—those who suffer them are deemed guilty, for such is the nature of misfortune.\n\nSome say: *\"The character for 'prison' (牢) contains 'ox,' and 'custody' (狱) contains 'dog.' If one does not consume oxen or dogs, one will forever avoid prison.\"* This is merely to teach people not to kill living beings, not to indulge their appetites, and not to invite disaster through craving. Such is an ancillary meaning of the scripture, appended here for reference.\n\nThe scripture’s benefit lies in redressing wrongs. Even if one has committed offenses in the past, sincere repentance and renewal, free from resentment, coupled with the scripture’s salvific power and unwavering devotion, will eventually lead to liberation.\n\nKing Wen, who attained the Dao and became a sage, was imprisoned in Youli yet composed the *Book of Changes* and was pardoned. Gongye Chang, who aspired to the Dao and became a worthy, was bound in fetters yet soon released. Xu Shengong and Zhang Ziyang, who attained the Dao and became immortals, endured imprisonment in Changyi and the torments of the Three Trials—yet through their steadfast cultivation of the supreme Dao and their wondrous transmission of the *Awakening to Reality*, they both achieved liberation.\n\nNot only sages and worthies—even the foolish, if they cast aside deluded thoughts and steadfastly believe in the true scripture, will naturally escape the perils of prison.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nIn the most ancient times, there were no criminals and no penal systems. The Yellow Emperor captured Chi You, devised shackles, and drew boundaries to enforce prohibitions—thus the concept of penal systems arose. After the Three Dynasties, the penal system was fully established.\n\nThe scriptures existed before the kalpas, first expounded by the Primordial Beginning in the heavens. How then can they speak of prisons? The reason is that in every kalpa and every place, there are both good and evil; evil naturally incurs retribution, and the principle of imprisonment is inherent. The scriptures encompass all methods and eternally benefit all beings, containing every principle and foretelling the efficacy of deliverance from sin.\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures say: *\"By the power of Guanyin, fetters and shackles soon fall away.\"* The Confucian classics say: *\"The noble person is mindful of punishment.\"* The *Book of Changes* speaks of *\"misfortunes that are not one’s fault.\"* Have they not also spoken of prisons? Thus, we know that the scriptures are not the words of recent times but primordial and mysterious teachings.\n\nIn essence, a single thought aligned with principle becomes a hall of fortune; a single selfish thought becomes a prison of karma. If desires and delusions are not eradicated, the body becomes a pit of karma, and prison is already present. Mencius said: *\"The difference between humans and beasts is slight.\"* The character for *\"prison\"* (牢) contains *\"ox,\"* and *\"custody\"* (狱) contains *\"dog.\"* The creators of these characters had profound intent. For people of the present and future ages, steadfastly believing in this scripture will ensure that in every kalpa and every place, prison is avoided.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two (Continued) of the Meritorious Virtues Section**\nIf one is afflicted by malevolent spirits, demonic thieves, or manifold sufferings, reciting this true scripture in accordance with its methods will cause all evil beings to flee far away, and one will naturally be at peace.\n\nThe divine efficacy of the Jade Scripture—how could it be limited to merely resolving the perils of prison?\n\nIf one is afflicted by any manner of evil demons, spirits, ghosts, thieves, or manifold sufferings, reciting this true scripture in accordance with its methods will cause all malevolent spirits, ghosts, and thieves to flee far away, and one will naturally be at peace and free from harm.\n\n**Textual Verification:**\n*\"If one is afflicted\"* (若为) is equivalent to *\"if one suffers.\"* *\"Malevolent spirits\"* (邪精) refers to all that is unorthodox; *\"ghosts\"* (鬼) are the numinous beings of the yin realm; *\"thieves\"* (贼) are those who harm people and things. Some say that *\"thieves\"* here refers to evil people. The previous section already mentioned that *\"bandits and soldiers all retreat of their own accord.\"* Why then is *\"thieves\"* here interpreted as referring to people?\n\nGenerally, evil demons, spirits, and ghosts lie in wait for opportunities and exploit vulnerabilities, entering through a person’s unorthodox thoughts. Their coming is untraceable, and their going is unseen. They inflict harm in secret, making their actions unpredictable—hence they are called *\"ghostly thieves.\"*",

      "translated_text": "From celestial demons above to earthly sprites below—mountain specters, water anomalies, tree spirits, metal essences, fire imps, plant oddities, the essences of birds and beasts, ice and charcoal apparitions, *chī* monstrosities, ghostly spirits—all manner of unorthodox entities abound. These bring myriad afflictions: hurling bricks and tiles, startling chickens and dogs to demand sacrifices, disturbing households. Some cause people to become disoriented, their spirits wandering in confusion, raving without reason, dashing about wailing, lost in stupor, leaping and retching, howling in depravity, drunk in folly, harmed and ruined, unable to rest or eat, day and night in terror. In life, they know no peace; in death, they remain bound and obstructed—such are the myriad afflictions. *\"Add\"* (加) means calamity befalling a person.\n\nIf one recites this true scripture in accordance with the proper method, how could one be afflicted by unorthodox essences, ghostly thieves, and the myriad afflictions? Here, *\"in accordance with the proper method\"* does not mean mere ease of practice but rather single-minded devotion, aligning with the true Dao. When reciting this scripture, one need only follow the prescribed method of chanting, bowing in reverence, and recitation—then all unorthodox essences and ghostly thieves will flee far away.\n\nAnother interpretation holds that reciting this true scripture in accordance with the proper method allows a Daoist practitioner to recite on behalf of the afflicted, driving away all unorthodox entities and ensuring natural peace. No talismanic waters, exorcisms, medicinal remedies, or incantations are needed—merely hearing the scripture, the afflicted will naturally find peace, free from the myriad afflictions.\n\nIt is said that the Ancestral Celestial Master subdued all demons with his methods. The Dark Emperor cultivated the true Dao, vanquishing all unorthodox essences and governing humans and ghosts. The Perfected Sage Sa overcame demonic forces in his propagation of the Dao. Lord Lao subdued celestial demons. The Buddha’s mantras tamed demons. The former Confucian scholar Fan Zhongyan, having lodged on a battlefield, heard only the cries of small chickens, and ghosts ceased their mischief. Master Cheng subdued the Great-Headed Ghost, and when a multitude of ghosts moved his bed, his mind remained unmoved—all ghosts then retreated into hiding. Thus it is said: *\"When the Dao is lofty, dragons and tigers submit; when virtue is weighty, ghosts and spirits revere.\"*\n\nReciting this true scripture in accordance with the proper method—this secret and sacred canon, the most holy of true words—unlocks the mechanism unseen by ghosts and spirits. How could unorthodox essences and ghostly thieves fail to flee far away?\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nIn essence, the Three Corpses within the human body, the Five Orifices, the Seven *Po* souls, the Seven Emotions, the Six Desires, scattered thoughts, and deluded imaginings—all these yin tendencies are unorthodox essences and ghostly thieves. If one awakens to emptiness and clarity, wielding the sword of wisdom to slay demons, and extinguishes desires, then unorthodox essences and ghostly thieves will flee far away.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three of the Meritorious Virtues Section**\nIf one seeks descendants and, in accordance with the proper method, venerates and recites this scripture, the Emperor commands the celestial bureaus to examine the cinnabar registers. Among the nine ranks, the Four Fruits of Immortals, whose karmic cycles align with the destined time, will be dispatched to descend and be born as one’s child—gifted with exceptional talent and eloquence, esteemed among humanity.\n\nDoes the merit of this scripture merely subdue unorthodox entities? If one, childless and suffering, seeks descendants and recites this scripture in accordance with the method of venerating the canon, the Supreme Emperor will command the celestial bureaus to thoroughly examine the cinnabar records of immortals. Among the nine ranks, the Four Fruits of Immortals, whose cycles and numbers align with the destined time, will descend and be born as one’s child. To those without descendants who recite the scripture, such a child will be born—brilliant in talent, skilled in debate, wise and discerning, attaining the noble station of humanity.\n\n*\"Seek\"* (求) means to pray and beseech the gods. It may refer to others praying on one’s behalf or to one’s own prayers. Whether one has descendants is decreed by Heaven—can it truly be sought? Yet among the three forms of unfilial conduct, having no posterity is the gravest. One cannot but seek descendants. Moreover, humans are born of blood and qi; all beings with blood and qi can procreate. Some may have depleted their yin virtue, incurring Heaven’s displeasure; others may suffer from misaligned yang and yin, their fate marked by solitude; still others may have deficiencies in the womb or self-inflicted harm from desire and anger—thus remaining childless. Yet human determination can reverse Heaven’s decree. Sincerity moves the divine; there is none who cannot have descendants. Thus, descendants may indeed be sought.\n\n*\"Descendants\"* (嗣息): *\"Si\"* means to continue; some say it means *\"to connect\"* (系), as in continuing the ancestral line like a linked chain. Others say *\"si\"* means *\"to administer\"* (司), as in managing the family’s legacy and ensuring the transmission of its records. *\"Xi\"* refers to children who carry on the lineage, like the ceaseless breath of inhalation and exhalation. Moreover, the true breath of a person is the root of life and death; when breath ceases, qi is cut off. Having children ensures the ancestral sacrifices continue unbroken—hence the term *\"xi.\"* Fundamentally, *\"xi\"* originates from the heart. With a child, all things are fulfilled, and this heart may rest at ease—thus it is called *\"xi.\"*\n\nThe sages of the Three Teachings all had children. Why do people not recognize the weight of descendants?\n\n*\"In accordance with the proper method and with veneration\"* refers to revering the scripture. Some mistakenly interpret this as self-veneration. *\"Celestial bureaus\"* (天曹) are those who govern destiny and oversee the registers of immortals. The *\"nine ranks\"* consist of the upper three, middle three, and lower three grades, totaling nine. The *Scriptural Exegesis* states: *\"The nine grades of lotus flowers serve as parents.\"* In Buddhism, the nine ranks include Buddhas, bodhisattvas, those of perfect enlightenment, voice-hearers, arhats, and the four dhyanas.\n\nThe *\"Four Fruits of Immortals\"* are *Srotaāpanna*, *Sakṛdāgāmin*, *Anāgāmin*, and *Arhat*. *\"Descending to be born\"* (降谪下生) means immortals and Buddhas incarnating in the human realm, hence *\"descending.\"* *\"Talent\"* (才) refers to exceptional skill; *\"eloquence\"* (辩) to unparalleled verbal acuity.",
      "overlap_context": "s to evil people. The previous section already mentioned that *\"bandits and soldiers all retreat of their own accord.\"* Why then is *\"thieves\"* here interpreted as referring to people?\n\nGenerally, evil demons, spirits, and ghosts lie in wait for opportunities and exploit vulnerabilities, entering through a person’s unorthodox thoughts. Their coming is untraceable, and their going is unseen. They inflict harm in secret, making their actions unpredictable—hence they are called *\"ghostly thieves.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The radiance of illumination shines upon all without exception. The wisdom of awakening comprehends all without obstruction. Among humankind, the most revered and noble are not merely kings, ministers, or teachers, but those who embody virtue and the Dao—perfected beings and true heirs. Thus, nothing is more revered than the Dao, nothing more noble than virtue. Even the Son of Heaven cannot enfeoff them as subjects, nor can feudal lords befriend them as equals. They assist in the unfolding of creation, shaping and sustaining all things, their legacy venerated for ten thousand generations, their supremacy acknowledged across the Three Realms. Hence, they are called the most revered and noble among humankind.\n\nTo revere this scripture in accordance with the Dharma, whether reciting it oneself or having others do so to seek descendants, though its efficacy is manifest, one must not expect results within a set time. Only by honoring the scripture, repenting of past transgressions, and maintaining unwavering devotion—treating this scripture as though beholding the Jade Emperor himself, and revering this Dharma-treasure with utmost sincerity—will the divine verses and numinous power silently transform fate, altering destiny and ensuring descendants. Even worldly meritorious officials may secure blessings for their offspring. How much more so for those who, as true believers in the scripture and propagators of the Dharma-wheel, become the meritorious ministers of Heaven and Earth? Shall they not ensure the prosperity of their descendants? If one reveres this scripture yet fails to beget heirs, it must be that their sincerity is insufficient or their devotion inconsistent with the Dharma. Let the people of the world take heed and be diligent, and they shall witness the scripture’s divine efficacy for themselves.\n\n**Chapter on Meritorious Virtues (continued, twenty-fourth section):**\nWhen a woman approaches the perilous month of childbirth and recites this true scripture in accordance with the Dharma, she shall secure the well-being of both mother and child, giving birth to sons or daughters of blessed fortune and virtue, beloved and revered by all. The scripture’s divine power extends far beyond merely ensuring descendants.\n\nWhen a woman in the perilous month of childbirth recites this true scripture in accordance with the Dharma, she shall promptly and safely deliver the child, free from distress, bearing sons or daughters of auspicious appearance and virtuous character, cherished and esteemed by all. A woman who has married into her husband’s family is called a *matron*. The *perilous month* refers to the time of childbirth, when life hangs in the balance, perilously close to death. To *recite the true scripture in accordance with the Dharma* means that, whether before labor begins—through her own devout recitation—or during labor—by having others recite the scripture—she shall ensure the safety of both mother and child. At the appointed hour of delivery, there shall be no complications; the child shall be born without delay, the mother unharmed, and the infant delivered smoothly, both thriving in peace and well-being, mutually benefiting.\n\n*Fortune* refers to those endowed with wealth, nobility, health, longevity, and auspicious signs. *Virtue* refers to those who are sagely, wise, loyal, righteous, filial, fraternal, and morally upright. *Sons or daughters* may be either male or female, both possessing fortune and virtue. *Beloved and revered by all* means they are endearing yet not to be treated with familiarity, approachable yet not to be trifled with. People delight in their company, praise them, and admire them—this is *love*. Yet at the mere sight of them, awe arises; in their presence, indolence vanishes. Though they speak not, they are trusted; though they act not, they are revered—this is *respect*.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nThat men are beloved and revered is understandable. But how can women be so? If a woman possesses a fully auspicious appearance, exemplary conduct, neither weeping nor frivolity, solemnity and reticence, minimal movement or laughter, displaying maturity in youth and dignity in age, maintaining purity until death, people will cherish her as kin and revere her as an elder. Such love is free from impropriety; it arises from admiration for her rare fortune and virtue.\n\n**Verification:**\nSafety of mother and child.",

The exegetical tradition states: \"Mother and child part early from the body.\" The *Daoist Canon* declares: \"At the moment of delivery, there is joy; in the pangs of labor, no peril.\" The merit of reciting scriptures responds as swiftly as an echo.\n\nToday, the *August Scripture* circulates widely in the world, and those who recite it are many. Yet when women give birth, some miscarry before their time; some suffer calamity, peril, or death; some bear ghostly fetuses or monstrous anomalies; some face karmic retribution or mutual affliction. Though many mothers and children remain safe, they cannot always both be preserved; in some cases, neither fares well. Some doubt the efficacy of recitation, unaware that the true Dharma is rarely encountered. Among the people, some have never heard of this scripture’s exalted status or its benefits; others have heard its name but fail to revere it. Some offer empty reverence without recitation; others recite but begin with zeal and end in neglect. Some omit passages or jumble them, or defile and invert them, miswriting characters and misplacing phrases, misconstruing their meaning. Though they may include texts of repentance and gratitude, they cannot attain the full merit of the scripture. All such errors are self-inflicted; failing to encounter the scripture’s power, they conclude that recitation is futile—this is slander of the Dharma.\n\nAlas! The true Dharma should be practiced, and the debt to one’s parents is hard to repay. To rescue the suffering and benefit the living is the urgent duty of those who study the Dao. If one teaches the world to revere and recite this scripture, mothers and children will be safe, the perils of childbirth averted, and good sons and daughters born.

How could the benefits of this Jade Scripture be limited merely to safe childbirth?\n\nTo seek office is to obtain position where none existed before. To advance in rank: *advance* means to ascend; when one’s post is humble, one strives for promotion to higher and more distinguished office. *Rank* refers to the titles conferred upon officials; *emolument* denotes the stipends they receive. *Flourish* signifies joyous ease, upright felicity, and propitious profit; *attain* means the fulfillment of one’s aspirations and the success of one’s plans. *Noble audience with the sovereign*: to rise above the common is to be noble; when rank and emolument flourish, one may further receive the sovereign’s governance and the ruler’s favor. The meeting of ruler and minister has ever been rare. Only when nobility is matched by audience with the sovereign does the minister’s elevation become truly meaningful—this is what it means to attain. Some say it refers to encountering a wise and enlightened ruler. The phrase *this true* is not redundant; the syntax requires it.\n\n*Office and duty*: an office entails both administrative authority and specific responsibilities, each with its own jurisdiction—hence *office*. *Duty* refers to governmental affairs. *Transfer* means to be reassigned to a more desirable post, or to move from an idle sinecure to a position of influence. *Descendants honored and exalted*: this may entail hereditary office and emolument, or the conferral of rank upon one’s children and grandchildren, ensuring enduring wealth, honor, and prosperity that illumines the past and enriches the future—both honor and nobility enduring unbroken through the generations. Though not equal to the permanence of heaven and earth, such blessings flow to posterity, their fortune and grace extending unbroken in an unending line. Even if limited to several generations, it is still called long-lasting. Consider the supreme virtue of Confucius or the divine transformations of the Ancestral Celestial Master—through the ages, their descendants received imperial enfeoffments, true honor and nobility unceasing.\n\nEnfeoffment, rank, and stipends derive from the imperial court’s official system. If they cannot be sought, how does one advance through the ranks? If they cannot be schemed for, then—whether in civil or military service—one must study the classics or master strategy, accumulating learning and merit, for these cannot be borrowed. How, then, can one seek advancement? The principle is this: office is conferred upon the virtuous, and emolument sustains the worthy. Those of great virtue must attain their rightful position and renown.\n\nIf one upholds this true scripture in accordance with the proper method, reciting its divine words and adhering to its sagely teachings, aligning one’s heart with heaven and moving in harmony with the Dao, one becomes a person of great goodness. Whether through eloquent speech or exemplary conduct, one may be recommended for office despite lacking rank, or granted emolument despite holding no post; or, if already in office, one may be promoted. This is the natural principle of employing the worthy. When virtue draws forth recognition, even if one seeks it not—like Guangcheng, Yin Shou, Chaoyou, or Yan Guang—one may become an imperial teacher or a guest of the state, though one may decline. How, then, can it be said that the good cannot obtain rank and emolument? Consider Zhuge Liang of the Han, or Jingyang, Li Bi, and Hai Chan of the Jin and Tang—all attained office through the cultivation of the Dao. The scripture speaks of seeking office; why doubt it?\n\nIn essence, the celestial rank of inherent nobility resides within us all. To transcend the mundane and enter sainthood is a gradual ascent in virtue. Through divine transformation, one ascends to immortality, enduring through the kalpas unharmed. As the *Daodejing* says: \"Though the body dies, it does not perish.\" The immortals’ traditions declare: \"Children beget grandchildren, and grandchildren beget descendants.\" The Dao is revered, virtue is exalted, and the transmission of immortality is endless. Those who do not covet worldly fame or fleeting profit, but cultivate the celestial rank of inherent nobility—progressing from the mortal to the sagely, transcending the dust to ascend as immortals—shall perpetuate their lineage forever. This is the true fruit of upholding this true scripture in accordance with the proper method.\n\n*Merit Section, continued from Chapter Twenty-Six*\n\nShould one desire abundant wealth and prosperity, and uphold this true scripture in accordance with the proper method, one shall obtain treasures in overflowing abundance, with clothing and sustenance naturally provided, blessings flowing to descendants and transmitted to posterity. How could the benefits of this scripture be limited merely to the fulfillment of one’s ambitions for office?\n\nShould one desire abundant household wealth and resources, and uphold this true scripture in accordance with the proper method, one shall obtain an overflowing abundance of goods, treasures, and luxuries, with clothing and food pure and plentiful, naturally abundant. The remaining blessings shall flow to descendants and be transmitted to posterity.\n\n*Resources* refers to what is needed; the necessities of oneself and one’s family are called *resources*. Some say it means *to rely upon*, signifying that people depend on these for their livelihood—equivalent to *capital*. *Wealth* refers to goods and property, or the means of sustenance. *Abundant* means substantial, the quality of being fully provided. *Prosperous* describes a household in the utmost plenty, with wealth and resources in full sufficiency.\n\n*Uphold*: to revere is to *uphold*; to maintain, observe, and recite. *Treasures*: *wealth* refers to goods and property; *treasures* are valuable items such as gold, silver, pearls, jade, rarities, curios, fine fabrics—all things rare, precious, and esteemed. *Overflowing* means full to excess; *abundant* means plentiful. *Clothing and sustenance naturally provided*: without expending effort, one enjoys natural abundance. *Blessings flowing to descendants*: *blessings* are auspicious signs; when fortune and grace extend far, passing through generations in unbroken succession, it is called *blessings flowing to descendants*. *Transmitted to posterity*: not limited to one generation’s children and grandchildren, but passed down through the ages, so that later generations forever enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\n*Resolving Doubts*:\nConfucius said: \"If wealth could be sought, though it required holding a whip as a lowly servant, I would do it. If it cannot be sought, I shall follow what I love.\" This strongly suggests that wealth cannot be sought—how, then, can this scripture say that if one desires abundance and upholds it in accordance with the proper method, one shall attain wealth and blessings flowing to posterity? Does this not imply that wealth *can* be sought?\n\nZixia said: \"I have heard that wealth and nobility are decreed by heaven.\" Though wealth may be desirable, fate determines it, and heaven truly governs it—how, then, can it be sought? Yet while wealth may be fated, the early Confucians said: \"Wealth, nobility, fortune, and grace enrich one’s end, as reward for virtue.\" To uphold this scripture in accordance with the proper method, reciting its celestial words and revering the august heavens, is to be one whose virtue earns blessing.",

      "translated_text": "The *Book of Songs* says: \"Joyful is the noble man—blessings and grace sustain him.\" This is precisely what is meant. Yet some argue: \"Great Yu was a sage, yet he drank plainly, wore coarse clothes, and dwelt in a humble palace, content with frugality and restraint.\" The Daoists say: \"To study the Dao, one must embrace bone-deep poverty.\" Such claims make the assertion that upholding this scripture brings wealth seem like a lure for personal gain. But Yu’s self-denial was the heart of a sage, free from selfish attachment. The Daoist pursuit of poverty was a mind unburdened by material things. That wealth may be sought and attained is but a demonstration of the scripture’s efficacy. The Buddhist sutras say: \"All that is sought shall be fulfilled.\" Both teachings open wide their gates of expedient means, offering boundless blessings and benefits—every prayer answered, every wish granted. Yet if doubt lingers, if effort wavers from diligence to neglect, if the heart’s resolve is flawed, lacking steadfast faith and perfect sincerity, then even seeking will yield nothing. Those who study this scripture must take this to heart.\n\nI have long observed that all things are complete within us, and inherent wealth requires no external acquisition. Why, then, do people chase fame and profit, vie for fleeting splendor, and indulge in desires, mistaking the false for the true? The poor grieve, unable to uphold the great Dao or recite the true scripture. The rich live in excess, unwilling to abandon cunning gain or honor the sacred words, content to age and die, forfeiting their innate abundance. Laozi said: \"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them; wealth and pride invite their own downfall.\" This warns against pursuing the external while neglecting the inner. Now, to speak of the scripture’s power to bring wealth is to redirect the heart’s pursuit toward reverence for the scripture. Ah! Upholding it truly yields results—but without sincerity, one invites only fault. Those who study this scripture must be cautious.\n\n**Chapter on Merits, Continued (27)**\nIf one is afflicted by malign stars, suffering hardship and confinement to bed, and upholds this true scripture according to the proper method, those malign stars will reverse their course and bestow auspicious blessings. The benefits of this scripture extend far beyond the attainment of wealth. If one’s fate in a given year is overshadowed by malign stars, bringing distress, restless sleep, and affliction, reciting this true scripture with due reverence will transform misfortune into fortune, turning those malign stars into harbingers of good fortune.\n\nRed Pine said: \"All people are solitary, each bearing a star.\" Yet the stars’ influence may be auspicious or inauspicious—auspicious stars bring a thousand blessings, while inauspicious ones foretell calamity. Those under the light of the Three Luminaries must ever be vigilant. Malign stars are inauspicious stars, such as Rahu, Ketu, the Star of Ruin, the Star of Wailing, the Star of Defeat, and the Star of Retreat. Their \"overshadowing\" may occur in one’s natal chart, annual fate, or the astrological division of one’s dwelling—wherever their influence falls, it is fixed and inescapable. \"Distress\" means thwarted aspirations, stifled and unfulfilled. \"Suffering\" may be poverty, illness, or peril pressing upon the body. \"Distress and confinement to bed\" describe utter helplessness, restless sleep, and unceasing agitation—some say it portends startling dreams. The term \"malign stars\" encompasses all inauspicious celestial bodies whose influence, whether in fate, annual fortune, or dwelling, brings misfortune.\n\nYet when one upholds this scripture with proper devotion, its divine verses transform ill omens into blessings. Though malign stars typically bring only misfortune, the scripture’s power ensures that those under their sway not only avoid calamity but receive hidden blessings and good fortune. The stars’ influence in fate or dwelling is fixed—how, then, can reciting the scripture turn malign stars auspicious? Heaven and humanity share a single principle, and the realms above and below are interconnected. The mechanism of resonance is swifter than an echo. When Duke Xiang of Song spoke three words of humane governance, the planet Mars retreated from its position. Nor is this power reserved for rulers: a faithful widow’s grievance brought three years of drought, and a lowly servant’s remorse summoned frost in June. Even common men and women can move heaven and earth, stir gods and spirits—provided their sincerity is unfeigned. With perfect sincerity, a single word can win the trust of the divine, and silence itself can alter the workings of creation. How much more so this true scripture, the essence of heaven and earth, by which the Three Luminaries attain their radiance! To uphold it with reverence, to honor its sacred verses and profound mysteries, is to scatter inauspicious stars, summon good fortune, and turn calamity into blessing.\n\nHuman nature is one: following the good brings fortune, defying it brings misfortune. The *Scripture of Central Admonitions* says: \"The stars’ influence—auspicious or inauspicious—is summoned by one’s own deeds. Those who do good shine with starlight; great goodness shines brightly. Those who do neither good nor evil glow faintly; minor transgressions scatter their light; grave sins extinguish it.\" When malign stars descend, their retribution falls upon the guilty; the blameless may escape punishment, while the virtuous turn misfortune into fortune. As the saying goes: \"A single evil thought becomes a malevolent star or vengeful ghost; a single good thought becomes a propitious star or auspicious cloud.\" Fortune and misfortune hinge on the goodness or evil of a single thought. To truly uphold this scripture is to dispel even the gravest disasters and calamities—how much more so the distress of confinement or fleeting misfortune? King Tai Jia said: \"Heaven-sent disasters may yet be averted.\" This is the same principle.\n\nWhen one can magnify the Dao and assist in creation, silently reciting the true scripture to penetrate the divine and master transformation, one’s virtue aligns with heaven and earth, one’s brightness with the sun and moon, one’s order with the four seasons, and one’s fortune with the gods and spirits. Mastering creation, one transcends the mortal realm, eluding the gaze of ghosts and spirits, untouched by life and death—how then could stars constrain one’s fate? Let those who study this scripture take heed.\n\n**Chapter on Merits, Continued (28)**\nIf one’s life has ended and they are bound for hell, their name recorded in the ledgers of the damned, their parents, teachers, spouse, or children may recite this scripture on their behalf, or establish a ritual altar with banners and offerings. Thus, the deceased’s name is erased from the ghostly registers, their spirit reborn in the Pure Land, and all suffering souls are delivered. By this supreme merit, all ascend to heaven.",

      "translated_text": "The merits of this scripture not only absolve one’s faults in life, but when a person’s allotted span has ended and their soul is bound for hell—with their name inscribed in the ledgers of evil—then their parents, teachers, spouse, sons, or daughters should recite this scripture on their behalf or establish a ritual altar for deliverance, adorned with banners and offerings. Thus, the deceased’s name is erased from the ghostly registers, their spirit reborn in the Pure Land, and all those who share the same hell, the same death, or the same ledger of suffering are likewise redeemed by the scripture’s power, ascending to heaven through this most sublime and wondrous Dharma benefit.\n\nWhen it is said that one’s *allotted span has ended*, it means their destined years have passed and they die. *Bound for hell* refers to those who, whether in past lives or this one, have committed sins and must enter hell to receive their karmic retribution. *Hell* encompasses realms such as Fengdu, the Iron Enclosure, the Nine Hells, Eighteen Hells, Twenty-Four Hells, Thirty-Six Hells, Seventy-Two Hells, and the Avīci Hell. *Inscribed in the ledgers of evil* means their name is recorded in the registers of wickedness to face retribution. *Parents and teachers* may refer to the deceased’s own parents, their mentors, or elders. *Spouse, sons, or daughters* indicates that whether the deceased was a man or woman, they would have had a spouse; if not, then children or other kin would remain. *Should recite this scripture on their behalf* means the living relatives must uphold and chant this scripture for the departed. *Or establish a ritual altar* refers to arranging a sacred space to follow the Daoist rites and liberate the deceased from sin, hence called a *ritual altar*. *Banners and offerings*: Banners, inscribed with endless praises of the sacred names, are hung from tall poles so the wind may carry their radiant light in all directions. *Flowers* are the finest blossoms offered to welcome the divine. In heaven, the spreading of the Dharma is naturally accompanied by banners, canopies, and pennants, as well as resplendent celestial flowers, all manifesting auspicious brilliance. In the mortal realm, banners are merely placed in the ritual space to adorn it and invoke divine favor. *Offerings*: *Offer* means to present, while *nourish* refers to providing food and drink. In heaven, the purest and most wondrous Dharma is the true sustenance, and the celestial kitchens’ sacred offerings are given only with reverence and devotion. In this world, the five offerings and ten offerings—though they may include the emptying of the five aggregates, the removal of the five sufferings, the restraint of the five pleasures, the abandonment of the ten evils, the contemplation of the ten truths, and the abiding in the ten faiths—are ultimately meant to honor the radiant deities, revere the true Dharma, and uphold the sacred scriptures. This is the true offering. Yet today, people merely present food, flowers, fruits, and rare treasures without genuine reverence—this is but a superficial practice. The *offerings* spoken of in this scripture are those of sincere and natural devotion.\n\n*Thus, the deceased’s name is erased from the ghostly registers, their spirit reborn in the Pure Land.* By reciting this scripture once or establishing a ritual altar, the departed are freed from the dark underworld, their black karma dissolved, their names stricken from the ledgers of evil, and their spirits reborn in the Pure Land of bliss. All those who share the same hell, the same death, or the same ledger of suffering are likewise delivered by the compassionate power of this scripture. *All* means everyone. *Ascending to heaven through this sublime Dharma benefit*: *This* refers to the merit of the scripture. Though heavenly blessings may eventually wane, a single recitation of this true scripture—or the establishment of a ritual altar—erases the sins of the deceased and those suffering in hell, allowing them to be reborn in heaven. If one upholds it perpetually, how could its merits ever be exhausted? Alas, hell has no gate—it is man who invites it; heaven has a path, yet the deluded cannot walk it. Moreover, the original nature of life is the true scripture of the Imperial Dao. To uphold and recite it always is to remain unstained by hell or heaven, forever attaining the mysterious truth.\n\nThus, those who diligently uphold this scripture:\n\n**Chapter on Merits, Continued (29)**\nWherever this scripture resides, the Ten Heavenly Perfected Great Saints and the Boundless Flying Celestial Kings shall attend and make offerings.

Whether going out or coming in, wherever they travel, all evil spirits will flee, demons and ghosts will be eradicated, malevolent spirits will hide in submission, and no calamity or misfortune shall draw near. When such a scripture-holder’s life is about to end, they will no longer witness the dreadful visions of hell but will instead see celestial maidens from the heavenly palaces descending with banners to welcome them, and they shall be reborn in heaven. When their heavenly blessings are exhausted and they descend to the human realm, for a thousand lives and ten thousand lives they shall always be kings or great ministers, blessed with sagely rulers and wise counselors, their lands at peace, their people content, and their innate nature ever luminous.

All serious illnesses shall naturally be cured. After the lives of these beings end, they shall not fall into hell but shall be reborn in the Pure Land, transformed from lotus flowers. How much more so for those who uphold this scripture!\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture, while traveling on the road, encounters a great wind that blows upon them, then wherever the dust from their body touches, all sentient beings shall have their evil karma completely eradicated. They shall no longer fall into the three evil destinies but shall be reborn in the heavens. Thus is the merit of upholding this scripture beyond all conception.\n\nThe merit of this scripture does not benefit only the individual. If one who upholds this scripture, when rain falls, arouses a heart of great compassion to deliver the world and, in accordance with the Dharma, recites these three scrolls—upper, middle, and lower—once toward the empty sky, then wherever the rain moistens and in the direction it faces, all sentient beings—those guilty of the five rebellions, the ten evils, and all grave transgressions—shall have their sins wholly dispersed and eradicated. All serious illnesses shall naturally be healed and restored to health. After the lives of these beings in the direction the scripture-holder faces end, they shall not fall into hell but shall be reborn in the Pure Land, free from defilement, transformed from lotus flowers. How could the merit of those who uphold this scripture be measured?\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture, while traveling on the road, encounters a great wind that blows upon them, then wherever the dust from their body touches, all sentient beings shall have their evil karma completely eradicated. They shall no longer fall into the three evil destinies but shall be reborn in the heavens. Thus is the merit of upholding this scripture beyond all conception.\n\n**Textual Verification and Doubt Resolution:**\nThe scripture-holder is compassionate in all places, not only when rain falls or wind rises. The phrase \"when rain falls or wind rises\" is used to emphasize the efficacy of upholding the scripture. \"Great compassion\" is the deep pity and concern for all beings in the world. As the Buddhist teachings say, \"the heart of compassion is too fervent.\" The *Book of Songs* says: \"Pity these solitary and suffering ones,\" and also: \"Have compassion for those who have not become whole.\" The Daoist scriptures say: \"Great compassion awakens the world.\" The scripture-holder, moved by the suffering of beings bound by karma, arouses great compassion.\n\nThe five rebellions are: disloyalty, unfiliality, lack of kindness, discord, and injustice. Another interpretation holds them to be: disrespect for Heaven and Earth, ruler and parents, and teachers; disrespect for the Three Treasures; failure to uphold precepts; neglect of virtuous conduct; and ignorance of the nature of mind. Yet another interpretation sees them as indulgence in wealth, sensuality, fame, food, and sleep.\n\nThe ten evils are: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, divisive speech, false speech, frivolous speech, harsh speech, greed, anger, and delusion.\n\n\"All serious illnesses shall be cured.\" *Cured* means restored to health; *healed* means returned to wholeness.\n\n\"Transformed from lotus flowers\": In Buddhist teaching, this refers to rebirth in the Western Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss, where beings are born from lotus flowers. In Daoist teaching, it refers to the Azure Flower Realm of Eternal Joy, where beings are transformed from lotus flowers. Another saying holds that desire arises from the lotus flower, meaning that in both worldly and transcendent existence, one remains unstained by a single speck of dust, and the wondrous Dharma gives rise to life without defiled thoughts. It is also likened to the primordial state of Heaven and Earth, where beings are naturally transformed into existence.\n\nConfucian scholars often dismiss these two teachings as delusion, yet was Yi Yin, born from a hollow mulberry, not a sage of the Confucian tradition? Moreover, the human heart is like the lotus—understanding the lotus’s birth reveals the seal of the mind’s essence. How excellent that Master Zhou, in observing the lotus, not only admired its purity amid mud but must also have had a deeper insight. Thus he became a patriarch of the Learning of the Dao.\n\nThe three evil destinies are hell, demonic spirits, and animals. \"Beyond conception\" means beyond the reach of thought or speech, signifying that the merit is immeasurable.\n\nThe Dao’s deliverance of the world and the true scripture’s benefit to humanity are like the soaking rain that nourishes all, resounding through the ten directions and benefiting the entire Dharma realm. The Confucian tradition says: \"There are those transformed as if by timely rain,\" and also: \"The wind in the trees makes its sound,\" and further: \"Not swift yet speedy, passing through and transforming, abiding and divine—people daily turn toward goodness without knowing who effects it.\" Thus when the Duke of Zhou was born, there were no violent winds or excessive rains, and even beyond the seas, people turned toward civilization. If one can ultimately attain the Dao and uphold the true scripture, then whether touched by rain or wind, or even where wind and rain do not reach and water and dust do not touch, the three thousand great thousand worlds shall forever be bathed in the benefit of the Dharma. Thus it is said that the merit of upholding this scripture is beyond conception.\n\n**Chapter on Merits, Thirty-One Continued**\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture crosses rivers, the Huai, or the sea, and bathes in their waters, then wherever the water from their body touches, all beings within—fish, turtles, soft-shelled turtles, and all aquatic creatures—shall have their evil karma wholly eradicated for the remainder of this life. After their lives end, they shall no longer be reborn from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation.\n\nAll speech and sound uttered by one who upholds this scripture shall be pure Dharma sounds, and all demonic and heterodox beings who hear them shall be thus purified.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture encounters temples of various spirits and recites this scripture for them, then upon hearing it, those spirits shall escape the ghostly realm and ascend to the attainment of immortality. They shall revere this person as if serving an emperor.",

      "translated_text": "The merit of one who upholds this scripture extends not only to humans. When this scripture passes through rivers, the Huai, or the sea, and one bathes in their waters, wherever the water from their body touches, all beings within—fish, turtles, soft-shelled turtles, and all aquatic creatures—shall have the evil karma they accumulated in past lives wholly eradicated for the remainder of this present life. After their lives end, they shall attain wondrous fruition and no longer be reborn from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation.\n\nAll speech and sound uttered by one who upholds this scripture—whether demons or heterodox beings hear them—shall not be perceived as worldly words or sounds but as pure Dharma tones. If one who upholds this scripture encounters temples of various spirits and recites this scripture for them, those spirits, upon hearing it, shall escape the ghostly realm and ascend to the attainment of immortality. They shall revere this upholder of the scripture as if serving the Emperor who expounds it.\n\n*Jingshe* (经涉): *Jing* means to pass through; *she* means to ford. One interpretation holds that *she* refers to crossing water on foot, as when Lü Dongbin chanted verses while flying over Dongting Lake or when Bodhidharma crossed the river on a reed. In essence, any crossing of water, whether on foot or by boat, is called *jingshe*. Rivers and seas are general terms for flowing waters. The Huai refers to the Huai River. *Muyu qishen* (沐浴其身) means to bathe one’s body in water. *Qizhong zhongsheng* (其中众生) refers to all living beings in the water. Those with scales are fish; those with shells are turtles, soft-shelled turtles, and the like. All aquatic life shall have their evil karma eradicated for this one lifetime alone. After death, they shall no longer cycle through the destinies of beasts—whether feathered, furred, scaled, shelled, or born of womb, egg, moisture, or transformation. Though humans are born of wombs, the term \"womb\" here does not refer to them but to other kinds. Even the dragon, lord of aquatic beings, is subject to karmic retribution; how much more so the lesser creatures below.\n\nThe true upholder of this scripture emanates golden light from body and speech. Thus, wherever their voice reaches, all demons and heterodox beings who hear it perceive only pure Dharma tones. When the scripture is recited for spirits, they escape the ghostly realm. Though spirits possess numinous power, manifest awe-inspiring radiance, and display karmic responses, they remain bound by their condition. Upon hearing this true scripture, their root consciousness is liberated, their karmic tendencies uprooted—what is called \"dissolving all past habits.\" They ascend to the attainment of immortality, the highest realization of the true immortal’s Way.\n\nThe distinction between spirits and immortals lies in their station. Though spirits may possess merit, their glory and achievements remain manifest; even great spirits are thus constrained. They resemble noble sages who have not yet transcended form and trace, or those who have entered sagehood yet remain unrefined. Immortals, however, empty the five aggregates, purify the nine consciousnesses, transcend subject and object, and merge principle and phenomena. Though divided into five ranks, they stand far above spirits and ghosts.\n\nWhen the sage emerges, all things flourish: mountains do not crumble, rivers do not dry, and birds, beasts, fish, and turtles all thrive in harmony. The dharma-water of the scripture-holder’s bath bestows its blessings upon aquatic beings, surpassing even the transformative power of a sagely king. When dragons receive the Dharma and awaken to profound insight, and when the dharma-water equally touches all, how could they not transcend? This is how the wild fox, upon receiving the Dharma, regained a human form. When the scripture is expounded to deliver spirits and ghosts from their condition—like Master Sa who delivered Marshal Wang or Master Pu who delivered Lord Guan—it causes them to revere divine majesty and forget past attachments. Thus, to this day, the reverence of these two sages has not waned.\n\n**Chapter on Merit, Continuation of the Thirty-Second Section**\n\nIf one, while alive, fails to honor parents, disrespects the Three Treasures, kills, steals, engages in sexual misconduct, or utters falsehoods—committing the gravest of sins—and is on the verge of death, should a devout and faithful man or woman, moved by great compassion, recite the august name of the Jade Emperor seven times, fourteen times, twenty-one times, twenty-eight times, or even a hundred or a thousand times by the dying person’s side before their last breath fades, then all the unwholesome karma they accumulated in life shall be wholly eradicated. They shall not fall into any evil destinies but shall ascend to the Nine Heavens of Primordial Qi. How much more so for one who upholds this scripture?\n\nFurthermore, if one has wandered through countless kalpas, drifting between heaven and the mortal realm, accumulating thousands of transgressions and myriad faults, and then encounters one who upholds this scripture—even if their shadow briefly falls upon them, as if embraced by the radiance of the Celestial Emperor, or if they converse with them or merely hear their voice, as if receiving the Celestial Emperor’s Dharma words of comfort—then that person’s karmic obstructions shall be forever eradicated.\n\nThe merit of this scripture extends not only downward to beings but upward to spirits and gods. If one, while alive, disrespects the Three Treasures, kills, steals, engages in sexual misconduct, or utters falsehoods—committing the gravest of sins—and is on the verge of death, should a devout and faithful man or woman, moved by great compassion, recite the august name of the Jade Emperor seven, fourteen, twenty-one, or up to a hundred or a thousand times by the dying person’s side before their last breath fades, then all the unwholesome karma they accumulated in life shall be wholly eradicated.

      "translated_text": "The master is the eye and guide for humans and devas; to disrespect them is to incur one sin. Taking life, theft, sexual misconduct, and false speech—great transgressions bring great sins, yet even the mere sprouting of a single thought of these is sinful. Such offenses are manifold, not confined to one type, and words cannot exhaust their enumeration.\n\nTrue faith is utmost sincerity, devoid of any ulterior motive. Whether reciting once in seven days, twice or thrice or four times in seven days, or a thousand or ten thousand times, or speaking of the Dao’s cyclical transformations of merit—all are valid. One does not fall into evil destinies, for one possesses good roots and harbors no perverse thoughts, thus avoiding such fates. Rebirth among humans and devas refers to the blessings of the human realm and heavenly realms. Some say human blessings constitute \"human-deva\" blessings. Drifting through the world’s domains describes the impermanence of life and death, like duckweed adrift on water, bound by karmic tendencies and difficult to escape, as if drowning in water. The world’s domains refer to the boundaries of the mundane realm.\n\nWhen the shadow of one who upholds this scripture briefly falls upon a wrongdoer, it is as if the Celestial Emperor’s radiance has embraced and received them. *Shou* (受) should not be read as *shou* (授, \"to bestow\"), for it is not the Emperor’s light bestowing upon them. Generally, when such light descends upon a person, reverence arises spontaneously, and distracting thoughts vanish—hence it is called \"embracing and receiving.\" We receive the Dharma benefits of that light.\n\nWhether conversing with or merely hearing the voice of one who upholds the scripture—if the wrongdoer engages with them or hears their voice, the words of the Dao are profound and mysterious. Some say these are the words of the Dao Ancestor, but this interpretation is overly restrictive. *Wei yu* (慰谕) means to comfort with kind words and instruct with teachings and commands. The eradication of karmic obstructions means all sins from past lives and the present are released, and all hindrances from past kalpas and the present life are removed.\n\nThe scripture’s divine efficacy benefits both the living and the deceased, extending its blessings universally. Yet only those of true faith receive this merit. Thus, the foundation lies in utmost sincerity. If even the deceased are thus benefited, how immeasurable must be the merit of one who upholds this scripture? Let the reader take heed.\n\n**Chapter 33 (Continued: Merits of Upholding the Scripture)**\n\nFurthermore, if one who upholds this scripture fashions a long banner, inscribes the Emperor’s sacred name upon it, and hangs it from a tall pole—whether at a Daoist abbey or in a household courtyard—when the wind blows the banner toward any direction, all beings in that quarter shall partake of its sublime blessings, and all their evil karma shall be eradicated.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture inscribes the Emperor’s sacred name upon any resonant object—be it bells, chimes, handbells, cymbals, or other ritual implements and instruments used in Daoist ceremonies—whether sounded in a ritual arena, struck in play, or set in motion by the wind, when the sound issues forth, near or far, all beings who hear it shall have their karmic obstructions purified. Here again is expounded the merit of upholding the scripture.\n\nLong banners inscribed with the Emperor’s name, tall poles—both have been explained previously. *Guanyu* (观宇) refers to the halls within a Daoist abbey. *Guan* (观) means \"abbey,\" where the spirit resides without distraction, for one’s mind is wholly fixed in sincere contemplation—hence it is called *guan*. *Jiating* (家庭) refers to the courtyard of a household. The direction the wind blows the banner is the quarter toward which it points. *Shengli* (胜利, \"sublime blessings\") has been explained earlier.\n\nBells, chimes, handbells, cymbals, and clappers are all ritual instruments made of metal. *All ritual implements and instruments* include those of metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, clay, leather, and wood, as well as any resonant objects or tools used in Daoist ceremonies. In a ritual arena, sounding the Emperor’s name with such instruments is appropriate. But how can striking them in play also yield merit? This \"play\" does not refer to reckless or frivolous behavior. It may include practicing ritual music, or the actions of children or the ignorant who, unknowingly or mistakenly, sound ritual instruments or resonant objects, or those who, in leisure, take delight in playing such objects.\n\nThe \"Emperor’s name\" is not merely a personal name. The Emperor’s sacred title is imperishable across kalpas, an eternal and supreme name—hence it is called a \"sacred name.\" Today, when we praise the Buddha’s \"great name\" or \"sacred title,\" it carries the same meaning. When the wind touches resonant objects and sound issues forth, all beings near or far who hear it shall have their karmic obstructions purified.\n\n**Textual Verification:**\nThe ancients created music to harmonize gods and humans, to unite high and low. How much more so for the Emperor’s sacred title, the glorious name of the Primordial Ancestor? Those who hear it are filled with reverence, and the vibration of the Dharma sound carries boundless divine efficacy. When the Great Shun composed music, even the beasts danced in unison—how much more so for humans? People grow solemn at the sound of weapons, amused at the sound of toys, and serene at the sound of the zither—how much more so for the Dharma sound? This applies to all resonant objects, not just ritual instruments. Ritual instruments are used to revere and commune with the divine, to unify the minds of the assembly. When the Emperor’s sacred name is inscribed upon them, those who hear it are moved to reverence, and their sins are extinguished.\n\nKarmic obstructions are the retribution for the wicked. Upon hearing the Dharma sound, a virtuous heart stirs within, and thus all karmic obstructions are eradicated, and purity is attained. The sound of thunder, which inspires awe and reverence in those who hear it, serves as evidence.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nIn the present age, many hang banners and inscribe the Emperor’s sacred name upon ritual instruments and resonant objects, and many witness or hear them—yet their karmic obstructions remain. Why? Those who inscribe the name do not do so with the true and sincere heart of one who upholds the scripture. Those who witness or hear it regard it as commonplace, their obstinate minds unchanged, even to the point of disdain, frivolity, or blasphemy. Without a virtuous heart, how can sins be absolved?\n\nAlas! The scripture and the Emperor’s sacred name possess immeasurable merit. First, one must uphold the scripture with true sincerity to transform oneself—then, without action, reverence arises; without words, faith is born. Only then, by propagating the Emperor’s sacred name to others, can one attain eternal benefit.\n\n**Chapter 34 (Continued: Merits of Upholding the Scripture)**\n\nFurthermore, if one who upholds this scripture awakens to the cycle of life and death, retreats deep into the mountains and forests to cultivate the Dao, and at times ascends to gaze upon the landscape—wherever their eyes alight, whether upon mountains, forests, streams, or valleys, all sentient beings—those with form and without, born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation, crawling, flying, or hidden creatures of every kind—shall have their karmic offenses eradicated, their bodies and minds purified, and upon death, ascend to heaven.",

The Dao is the source of the Three Teachings and the origin of all existence; the scriptures are the bridge to salvation across the world.",

      "translated_text": "How much more so for one who receives and upholds this scripture? Know that such a person is the very embodiment of the *Daozang*’s merit and power.\n\nThis further expounds the efficacy of upholding the scripture. To awaken to the cycle of life and death—life and death are matters of great consequence, their principles most difficult to fathom. We are born from the essence and blood of our parents, receiving the principle and *qi* of Heaven and Earth; yet why we live remains unknown. When essence is depleted and *qi* dispersed, spirit departs and form withers; yet why we die remains unknown. Though one may grasp the vicissitudes of affairs, observe the principles of things, speak with clarity, and act without delusion, without knowing life and death, one has not truly awakened. But if one who upholds this scripture severs attachment to sageliness and abandons cunning, removes the two obstacles, severs all delusions, dissolves karmic nature, attains great enlightenment, verifies the Three Origins, and ascends to the highest realm—awakening to the root of life and death—this is what the Buddhist school calls thorough awakening.\n\nTo retreat deep into the mountains and forests—of old, it was said: \"The lesser hermit dwells in the mountains.\" Yet if one has awakened, whether on lofty peaks or level plains, all is a Daoist sanctuary; why must one enter the mountains and forests? The greater hermit dwells in the marketplace—this, too, is principle. But renowned mountains and sublime landscapes, where the land is numinous and people outstanding, are where true cultivators, though they may have no intent for mountain forests, find secluded peaks and lush groves, fashioned by Heaven and Earth as immortal realms. Thus, recluses enter therein.\n\nTo cultivate authenticity and study the Dao—humanity’s true nature is utterly genuine, without falsity; the nature of the Dao is spontaneous, not awaiting study. Yet as emotions and desires daily grow, knowledge is seduced and things transform, the genuine gradually becomes false, and the nature of the Dao obscured. Those who have awakened, in the mountains and beneath the forests, silently cultivate and return to celestial authenticity, studying the great Dao to liberate themselves from the cycle of life and death. The *Daode Jing* says: \"Abandon learning, and there will be no sorrow.\" Yet here it speaks of studying the Dao—why? There, \"abandoning learning\" means forsaking the names, forms, and discriminations of conventional knowledge. Here, \"studying the Dao\" means learning the vast and effortless Way.\n\nIn the Buddhist school, thorough awakening is the highest attainment. Here, only after awakening does one enter the mountains to cultivate authenticity and study the Dao—thus, the gradations of the two traditions may be discerned. At times, those who study the Dao ascend heights and visit waters, traveling through sublime landscapes, gazing in all directions from the mountains. Wherever their eyes alight—whether upon mountains or forests, rivers, streams, ravines, or valleys (valleys being the deep, hollow, and vast gorges of mountains)—all sentient beings, all categories of life imbued with the intent of the great Creator, whether formed or formless (formed being those already born; formless, those not yet born—though some are born yet lack visible form), whether born from womb or egg, from moisture or transformation, crawling, flying, or hidden creatures—all beings stirred by the great Creation, moving or still, soaring high or lurking deep, those that walk between the flying and the hidden, every kind of creature—all their karmic offenses, past and present, are eradicated. Their bodies and minds become pure, free from entanglements, and at death, they all ascend to heaven.\n\nIf the mere gaze of a cultivator can deliver and save beings to such an extent, how much more so for one who receives and upholds this scripture? Know that the merit of such a person is boundless, the very treasury of the great Dao, immeasurable in its power—this is the embodiment of great merit and virtue. For those who study the Dao, their hearts are vast with compassion, and their benevolence knows no bounds. Though unseen and unheard, their minds cannot be perceived; yet wherever their gaze falls, all beings, moved by their intent to cherish life and recognize the dharma-nature in all, are silently spiritually delivered and rescued from the world. Thus, all are saved. Such is their merit.\n\nThe Confucian classics say: \"Achieve the center and harmony, and the myriad things will be nurtured.\" They also speak of establishing a numinous terrace to observe vapors and omens, discern calamities and blessings, and harmoniously complete the myriad things, aiding and assisting their transformation. Where Heaven and Earth cannot reach, they enable beings to accept their lives and deaths in accord with the correct mandate, returning to the source of transformation—what karmic offenses could remain?\n\nThose who praise Confucius say: \"In his lifetime, his learning could not be exhausted; through generations, his depths could not be fathomed.\" That which is beyond knowing is called the divine. Now, in praising those who cultivate authenticity and study the Dao, we say: \"the embodiment of the *Daozang*’s merit and power.\" This, too, speaks of that which is all-embracing, unfathomably profound, and beyond all praise. Only those who contemplate this scripture and attain realization will understand this meaning.\n\n**Chapter 35 (Continued: Merits of Upholding the Scripture)**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Jade Emperor of the Void: \"Now, I have briefly spoken, yet have not exhausted its wonders. If I were to expound at length, even after kalpas beyond count, the merits of this scripture for those of deluded views, doubts, and unbelief could not be fully expressed.\"\n\nAt that time—*see previous explanation*. The Heavenly Worthy is the Most High, the Primordial Beginning. *Addressed*—to speak to; the Primordial Beginning spoke to the Jade Emperor of the Luminous Void of Heaven. Another name is the Jade Emperor of the Mysterious Void of the Jade Clarity. *Now I have briefly spoken*—here, the Primordial Beginning refers to the time of expounding the scripture. *I*—the Primordial Beginning’s self-reference. *Briefly spoken*—to speak in broad strokes. *Not exhausted its wonders*—not fully expressed the essential wonders of the Dao and the supreme merits and virtues.",

Through its power, blessings shall ascend to all the heavens, pervade the Three Realms, and the sufferings of the Three Paths and Five Torments shall all be extinguished. We beseech your compassion to expound these wondrous principles for our sake.\"\n\nAfter the divine hosts had extolled the merits of the divine incantations and the virtues of the Emperor’s sacred titles, the August Emperor of the Vast Heaven—also known as the August Emperor of the Vast, Lofty, and Mysterious Heaven (not merely the Vast Heaven of ordinary times)—heard the Heavenly Worthy expound the scriptural Dharma. Rising from his own seat, he knelt before the Jade Emperor and petitioned: \"May the supreme sagely compassion extend universally to all in the great assembly\"—or, as some say, to all the divine hosts who hear this scripture, or to the vast multitudes of the world (for though the heavens contain no mortals, this scripture broadly delivers the Three Realms through kalpas of tribulation; both interpretations are valid)—\"and to all the devas and humans who uphold this scripture, that the benefits of this teaching be proclaimed in full.\"\n\nThereupon, the Jade Emperor of the Most High, moved by the sublime intent to deliver all beings, opened the gate of eternal and boundless beneficence, proclaimed the jade-casket precepts—this scripture being enshrined in jade tablets and precious caskets, treasured in the heavens—and transmitted the great Dharma of the Mysterious Numinous Treasure. He addressed the August Emperor of the Vast Heaven, saying: \"Now listen carefully\"—\"you\" refers to the August Emperor of the Vast Heaven, and \"listen carefully\" means to attend with single-minded clarity—\"and I shall expound for you the merits of receiving and upholding this scripture: how it upholds all in peril, rescues all from suffering, and brings wondrous benefits to both the living and the dead.\"\n\nThe assembled Perfected Ones bowed their heads and spoke in unison: \"Today, we are fortunate to hear the Dharma of serene and ever-abiding truth. The nature of humanity is inherently luminous, neither defiled nor pure, neither formed nor destroyed, neither ascending nor sinking, fundamentally serene and ever-abiding. Yet deluded by worldly entanglements, beings bring about their own ruin, drifting and sinking in the cycle of rebirth, blind and ignorant, unable to abide in serenity. Ghosts and spirits, though endowed with consciousness, when their retribution is exhausted, are reborn in turn and likewise cannot abide in serenity. Now, through the merits and benefits of hearing this scripture, our original nature is restored, the roots and dust are purified, karmic consciousness is uprooted, sins and obstacles are eradicated, and firmness and perfection are attained. To hear the Dharma of serene and ever-abiding truth is a rare encounter across ages—how could we not count ourselves fortunate?

To know its efficacy and uphold it with a true heart is to not betray the compassion of those who preach the scripture.\n\n**Chapter Two of the Protective Upholding**\n\nThe Jade Emperor proclaimed: Should any being honor and support their parents, revere the Three Treasures, devote loyalty to their sovereign, refrain from killing or stealing, avoid licentiousness and jealousy, forsake anger and resentment, abandon arrogance and deceit, observe precepts and maintain purity, contemplate the Great Dao with a tranquil mind, and hold this scripture in reverence, I shall command the following:\n\nDispatch throughout the Dharma realms and transmit across the boundless worlds in the ten directions. Command the Eastern Emperor Lord of Azure Radiance, the Azure Rider, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Southeastern Great Emperor of Fusang, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Southern Great Emperor of Vermilion Mound, the Crimson Rider, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Southwestern Primordial Elder of Great Flower, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Western August Numinous Sovereign Elder, the White Rider, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Northwestern August Heavenly Thearch, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Northern Emperor Lord of Purple Tenuity, the Black Rider, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Northeastern Heavenly Lord of Impenetrable Void, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Supreme Heavenly Thearch of the Upper Realm, the Yellow Rider of Kunlun’s Ancient One, with his divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand the Heavenly Lord of Harmonious Advent from the Lower Realm, with the divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts of the famous mountains and grotto-heavens, to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nThe Jade Emperor proclaimed: Upholding the scripture is not merely reciting it with the mouth. If any being in the world honors and serves their parents, reveres the Dao, scriptures, and masters of the Three Treasures, exhausts their strength and whole heart in utmost loyalty to their sovereign, refrains from killing, stealing, or licentiousness, forsakes jealousy, anger, resentment, arrogance, and deceit, receives and observes the pure and mysterious precepts of the Daoist canon, maintains true and proper fasting, avoids negligence and impatience, abides in tranquility and equanimity, silently follows nature, nurtures the spirit in stillness, models themselves after Heaven to solidify their true nature, contemplates the Great Dao with a profound mind, reveres the August Heaven as if it were present, and holds the Dao and its scriptures in esteem and veneration—\n\nIt is also said: One must cultivate strict reverence without carelessness, uphold, recite, and chant this scripture.\n\n*I, the Jade Emperor, speak of myself. Read as \"We.\"*\n\nThen command the dispatch throughout all worlds and Dharma realms, transmitting across the boundless worlds in the ten directions. Command the Eastern Emperor Lord of Azure Radiance, the Azure Rider; the Southern Great Emperor of Vermilion Mound, the Crimson Rider; the Western August Numinous Sovereign Elder, the White Rider; the Northern Emperor Lord of Purple Tenuity, the Black Rider; and their divine immortals and celestial troops.\n\nThe Southeastern Great Emperor of Fusang, the Southwestern Primordial Elder of Great Flower, and the Northwestern August Heavenly Thearch belong to the Qian direction. The Northeastern Heavenly Lord of Impenetrable Void and the Supreme Heavenly Thearch of the Upper Realm—this is not the Celestial Thearch of the Curved Array, but the deity who governs Heaven. *The Buddha calls him the Heavenly Lord Śakra.* The Yellow Rider of Kunlun’s Ancient One and the Heavenly Lord of Harmonious Advent from the Lower Realm, along with the divine immortals, celestial troops, and innumerable hosts of the famous mountains and grotto-heavens, are all commanded to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\n*To shield: to protect, cherish, and uphold.* Those who uphold the scripture respect and honor the words of the Emperor and the Dao, aligning their virtue with Heaven and the Dao to merge with the true. They embody the Great Dao. Where the Dao resides, both gods and humans revere it; thus, the Emperor commands the sacred hosts of the ten directions to shield them. Yet this applies only to those who are loyal, filial, reverent, and observe the precepts against killing, stealing, licentiousness, and deceit.\n\nUpholding the scripture is rooted in virtuous conduct. Contemplate the Dao with a profound mind, and the Dao will naturally return to you. Some say that Daoists who leave the household do not draw near to sovereign or kin, deeming them disloyal and unfilial. Yet they do not understand that the mysterious precepts of the Daoist gate are most strict—those who observe and cultivate them dare not violate the precepts, lest they harm their bodies and shame their kin. With utmost sincerity and firmness, they first repay the Four Gratitudes. How could they ever forget their sovereign or kin, or fail in loyalty and filial piety? Thus, the Perfected Lord Xu permitted the *Scripture of Pure Brightness on Loyalty and Filial Piety* to reveal the true loyalty and filial piety of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Three of the Protective Upholding**\n\nCommand all Golden Immortals of the ten directions, the Four Assemblies, the Eight Divisions, and all their retinues to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.\n\nCommand all Heavenly Perfected Great Sages, Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Three Officials, the Four Saints, the Two Luminaries, the Nine Stars, the Northern Dipper, the Southern Dipper, the Eastern Dipper, the Western Dipper, the Central Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, all the stars of the celestial sphere, the Vajra Warriors, the Divine Kings, and their respective hosts to descend and shield those who uphold this scripture.",

      "translated_text": "To cultivate the heart and refine the body does not lie in recitation or perusal, but in silent operation with utmost sincerity, free from self-interest. When spirit, essence, and qi are whole, sageliness may be learned, Heaven may be aspired to, and the Dao may be entered—every movement shall be auspicious, and the spirits will surely protect one. If the Three Treasures are depleted and the One True [Nature] is lost, one’s own spirits wane and qi weakens, essence fails to flourish, and one falls into opposition with Heaven—how could the spirits protect such a one?\n\nAlas, all are human: the noble one cultivates and meets with fortune, while the petty one rebels and meets with misfortune. Thus the scripture states: those who uphold and protect this scripture shall know that Heaven bestows blessings upon the virtuous. The imperial virtue is boundless, and the scripture’s benefits are supreme—it depends solely on how one reveres and receives it.\n\n**Chapter on Protection and Upholding (IV)**\nBy imperial decree, the Vajra Warriors of Subduing Demons, the Four Heavenly Gate Kings, the deities of the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, all renowned mountains, the Four Seas and Nine Rivers, the Twelve River Sources, mountains and forests, rivers and marshes—all their lords and retinues—are commanded to shelter and protect those who receive and uphold this scripture, ensuring their safety in all perilous places.\n\nBy imperial decree, all local earth spirits, ditch and canal deities, and all mighty ghost kings are commanded to shelter and protect those who receive and uphold this scripture.\n\nThe Twelve River Sources are here recorded as thirteen names, for two waters share a single source—hence they are called the Twelve River Sources.\n\nBy imperial decree, the Demon-Subduing Kings and Heavenly Ding Warriors are commanded.\n\nThe Four Heavenly Gate Kings are the kings of the eastern, southern, western, and northern heavenly gates. The Five Marchmounts are Mount Tai in the east, Mount Heng in the south, Mount Hua in the west, Mount Heng in the north, and Mount Song in the center. The Four Waterways are the deities of the Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Ji Rivers. All renowned mountains in the world are included. The Four Seas are the eastern, western, southern, and northern seas. The Nine Rivers are the Yangzi, Qiantang, Hanshui, Xunyang, Huntong, Jinjiang, Xiangjiang, Wulong, and Yalu, along with all other rivers. The Twelve River Sources refer to the Yellow River as the world’s pulse—its origins include Kunlun, Yumen, Star Constellation Sea, Huodunnao’er, Weilu, and the sources of the Faxie River. Another account states that the Yellow River’s source at Kunlun has nine wells and seven springs, not merely twelve. The Twelve River Sources refer to Yu’s dredging of the Nine Rivers, along with the Ru, Han, Huai, and Si Rivers, totaling twelve. The Nine Rivers are the Tuhai, Taishi, Majia, Fufu, Husu, Jianjie, Goupan, Gejin, Ru, Han, Huai, and Si—these are the Twelve River Sources. The Yellow River is the general spirit of all rivers. Rivers such as the Jing, Wei, Yi, Wen, Zhen, Wei, Hutuo, Xingqia, Weak Water, and all others are its tributaries.\n\nMountains and forests encompass all in the world. Rivers and marshes encompass all in the world. Flowing waters are called *chuan*; marshes are watery expanses. \"All lords\" refers to the spirits presiding over mountains, forests, rivers, and marshes, along with their retinues, who shelter and protect those who receive and uphold this scripture. In all dangerous and treacherous places, they ensure safety and stability for those who uphold the scripture.\n\nWherever the imperial decree reaches, all local earth spirits and responsive numina, along with ditch and canal deities—where a ditch is a waterless channel, whether in mountains or earth, and a canal is a water-filled channel—and all other minor spirits, as well as all mighty ghost kings, are commanded to shelter and protect those who receive and uphold this scripture.\n\nThe scripture’s dharma decree is revered by all immortals, upheld by all buddhas, practiced by all heavens, venerated by all spirits, and recited by all people—even demonic forces submit of their own accord. Truly, mountains are thus stilled, waters thus flow long, and protection is thus strict. Since those who uphold the scripture are guarded by all spirits, how could they dare be negligent? A single lapse brings profound transgression and grave offense.\n\nHow well Confucius said: \"The petty person does not know the Mandate of Heaven and thus does not stand in awe of it.\" To treat the great with familiarity, to mock the words of sages—such is the petty person.

They transform the heart and alter thoughts, turning toward the Dao and forgetting self-interest. \"Soaring beyond the seas\" is a common expression, akin to \"the soul flying beyond the heavens\" or \"the spirit scattering to the nine skies.\" They flee to distant lands, daring not remain in their former abodes.\n\nThus, all spirits of mountains and forests, altars to earth and grain, shrines and temples, and those who partake of blood sacrifices shall dissipate on their own. *Mountains and forests*—explained previously. *She* (社) is the earth deity; *ji* (稷) is the grain deity. *Ci* (祠) means to administer or to sacrifice, where the spirit presides and is invoked in prayer. *Miao* (庙) means to attend, where spirits are honored in the temple with morning rites—those who receive offerings of blood and sacrificial wine.

      "translated_text": "Thus, Master Sa the Perfected subdued Marshal Wang Lingguan and reformed the forbidden city gods; when Ximen Bao governed Jizhou, he cast the witches into the river to restrain the river deity. How much more, then, when evil spirits falsely assume divine forms to delude people, and people revere such evil to deceive the world? When Hu Ying administered Guangdong, he destroyed illusory Buddhas, slew the serpent demon, and beat the monks to liberate the foolish masses from their delusions. Now, it is said that all ghosts and spirits shall dissipate on their own—those who uphold this scripture’s decree shall neither invite misfortune nor fortune, and shall dwell in peace, free from threats or clamor.\n\nThe plague-spreading demon marshals of the five directions, all malevolent ghosts and spirits—whether the fierce ghosts and overbearing deities of the world, the wind-controlling kings, the aquatic monsters, the violent dragons, the perverse and inauspicious spirits, the earth spirits and tree specters—shall all vanish of their own accord. The five deficiencies and six depletions—where the five viscera (spirit, qi, blood, and body) grow weak, and the six pulses decline—shall cease, along with disordered dreams and restless souls. Alternatively, the five deficiencies and six depletions refer to celestial omens like Heaven’s Wailing and Ruin, along with baleful stars such as Sangmen, Tai Sui, Great Depletion, Lesser Depletion, Fei Kang, Kong Wang, Yellow Pennant, Leopard’s Tail, Nine Fruits, Red Mouth, White Tongue, and the malevolent spirits of curses, oaths, hexes, and poisons—all such base practices, heterodox ways, incantations, and demonic speech, whether cursed or sworn, shall likewise dissipate.\n\nFor those who uphold this scripture with sincere devotion, all desires and aspirations shall be fulfilled as their hearts wish, without hindrance or opposition. The virtuous and those who walk the Dao command the reverence of ghosts and spirits, while all inauspicious and perverse forces are dispelled. Witness the death of the ominous mulberry, the expulsion of pestilence by the catalpa staff, the subduing of the flood dragon by Zheng Yang, the vanquishing of demons by the Celestial Master, and the binding of ghosts by the Sa Patriarch—all these bear clear testament. Alas, Wang Yanfang was a man of valor; even bandits, when sentenced to execution, dared not let Yanfang learn of their heterodox ways, for his virtue was as resounding as a bell.\n\nYet the three corpses, five burdens, seven emotions, six desires, and nine consciousnesses within a person—when these lower evils wreak havoc, they deceive one into failing to correct oneself, allowing perverse forces to persist and inauspicious influences to linger. If one can rectify their path, sever the three corpses, eliminate the five burdens, purge the emotions and desires, and expel the nine consciousnesses’ evils, then their personal aspirations shall be fulfilled, external perils shall vanish, and misfortune shall scatter while fortune arrives.\n\n**Chapter on Upholding the Six Precepts**\nEven those who cannot yet follow the ritual codes and observe fasts or jiao offerings may still uphold purity and precepts, maintain unwavering faith, and revere this scripture with devotion—such persons are equal to those who perform the fasts. Those who uphold pure precepts shall find their merit unimpeded, their virtue unobstructed, and they shall be called sages among men, their wisdom and power ever-renewed, akin to the perfected immortals.\n\nFor those who receive and uphold this scripture in accordance with the Dao, their merit shall be immeasurable. Even if one cannot yet follow the profound ritual codes and perform grand jiao offerings, so long as they maintain purity without defilement, uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion, and observe the Daoist commandments—whether the Five Precepts, Eight Precepts, Twelve Precepts (as appropriate), Eighteen Precepts, Twenty-Four Precepts, Thirty-Six Precepts, Seventy-Two Precepts, One Hundred Twenty Precepts, One Hundred Eighty Precepts, Three Hundred Great Precepts, or the Six Hundred Pure Precepts for female Daoists—if they focus their will, uphold these precepts with unwavering resolve, and revere this scripture with sincere faith, they shall be counted among those who perform the fasts. Those who uphold pure precepts in this way shall find their merit unimpeded.\n\nEven those who cannot yet follow the ritual codes, perform fasts or jiao offerings, or maintain purity while revering the scriptures—if they can uphold purity, maintain single-minded faith, and revere this scripture with devotion—are all equal to those who perform the fasts and uphold pure precepts. The merit of those who cannot yet follow the ritual codes but perform fasts or jiao offerings, or those who revere the scriptures with purity, is the same. The gods shall respect and protect those who uphold these pure precepts.\n\nAlternatively, if one maintains purity and single-minded devotion in upholding their precepts, their merit shall be unimpeded. \"Unimpeded\" means level and vast. If the heart is divided, merit cannot be genuine. If precepts are not upheld, merit is tarnished. When body and mind are pure, precepts are upheld with devotion, faith is sincere, the scripture is revered, the heart is undefiled, and resolve is unwavering—without deficiency or hindrance—then merit is true and naturally unimpeded. What obstacle could remain? They shall dwell in freedom and ease.",

These are all spirits deemed worthy of worship, yet how can they be made to dissipate on their own? Spirits that demand sacrifices must be unjust; people who flatter spirits must be unrighteous.",

      "translated_text": "Human nature is born free and unconfined. Yet beset by worldly cares and material burdens, one toils in ceaseless hardship, no longer at ease—how can there be joy? With purity and right faith, free from material burdens, one attains great freedom, ever joyful and carefree. Such a one is called a sage among men—not merely a carefree person. With purity and right faith, rising above the common throng, they are called a sage among men. Their virtue and wisdom ever renew, cultivated with growing insight; transformation aligns with the heart, perception is true and wisdom profound, worldly burdens fade and true nature abides in clarity. Virtue daily renews, wisdom daily brightens—this is virtue and wisdom ever new. Together with the perfected ones—those of pure and right faith who uphold the scriptures and attain the Dao, the celestial perfected—such is the meaning of purity, precept-holding, single-minded devotion, reverence, and unwavering respect. Without thought of merit or intent to impress, one acts without ulterior motive, utterly free from pretense or interruption. This is what Confucius meant by \"even in haste or during a meal, never deviating,\" and what the *Doctrine of the Mean* describes as \"finding fulfillment in every circumstance.\" Zhuangzi expounded the essence of *carefree wandering*, Hai Chan composed the *Song of Joy*, Buddhism speaks of *great freedom*, and the Confucian classics speak of *daily renewal*—all are natural effects. How could they be borrowed or forced?\n\nAlas! Purity and right faith, even without relying on ritual codes or performing fasts and jiao offerings, possess this natural merit. Thus, the profound teachings of the Dao lie in truly embodying the scriptures' meaning. Ritual codes and jiao offerings merely propagate the Dharma to spread the Dao’s transformation. Chen Tuan chanted the *Scripture of Salvation* and attained the Dao—this was truly upholding the scripture’s essence. Today’s jiao offerings lack evident efficacy because they possess grand rituals but no true cultivation. If purity and right faith are combined with jiao offerings, their merit is greatly enhanced. Without jiao offerings, true sincerity alone still yields divine merit. But without true sincerity, jiao offerings become mere formalities—how could they avoid fault?\n\n**Chapter on Upholding the Sevenfold Merit**\n\nAt that time, the August Heavenly Emperor, having heard these words, bowed before the Emperor and chanted:\n\nGreat is the Supreme Dao, formless and nameless.\nVast through countless eons, the Yellow Dao opens in clarity.\nDivine clarity shines radiant, the Nine Qi emit their essence.\nJade Void gleams pure, the Great Rosy Clouds rise in brilliance.\nThe Jade Emperor unfolds transformation, universally delivering heaven and humanity.\nThe Three Origins nurture the Dao, the Two Images embrace life.\nRotten trees and dead roots, once withered, are made to flourish.\nAll creatures that creep and breathe attain long life and transformed forms.\nThose with child or in gestation all achieve birth and completion.\nThe dead, their fate expired, souls return to the Three Clarities;\ntheir po spirits refined and delivered, ascend to the Southern Palace.\nToday is most auspicious—all attain luminosity.\nThe Five Emperors reflect and illumine, universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits.\nHeavenly gods and earthly deities, all river sources,\nthe Five Peaks and Four Waterways, all famous mountains,\nCaverns of Mystery, Void, Emptiness, and Immortality—\nthe boundless Great Sage, the Most Perfect Honored Deities,\nlimitless and infinite, universally oversee deliverance.\nEvil roots severed, names recorded in the Mystic Capital.\nThe assembled perfected array, heed the Emperor’s words.\nThis scripture is the Emperor’s decree: those who recite and uphold it\nshall reach the Dao’s shore, untouched by calamity.\nBy the Emperor’s command, all shall obey.\n\nAt that time—referring to the aforementioned merits of upholding—\nthe August Heavenly Emperor, having heard these words, bowed before the Jade Emperor and chanted in praise:\n\nGreat is the Supreme Dao, measureless and unattainable.\nFormless and nameless, unseen and unheard—even its name is but a forced designation.\nVast through countless eons, without beginning or end,\nthrough innumerable kalpas—\"a hundred thousand\" is called *yi*, but this merely denotes vast numbers, for in truth they are without count.\nThe Yellow Dao opens in clarity, an auspicious time of celestial harmony.\nDivine clarity shines radiant, the divine wind eternally pure, luminous and bright.\nThe Nine Qi emit their essence—the Nine Qi of Fusion, Flame, Evolution, Vastness, Radiance, Dao, Chaos, Cavern, and Vastness.\nAs the Yellow Dao opens and inauspicious omens dissolve, the Nine Qi display their brilliance, emitting their essence in wondrous splendor.\nJade Void gleams pure—jade light, empty and bright, serene in its clarity (or: the Heaven of Jade Void shines radiant).\nThe Great Rosy Clouds rise in brilliance, the Great Mystery’s rosy glow, supremely high and luminous.\nThe Jade Emperor unfolds transformation, opening and delivering through teaching.\nUniversally delivering heaven and humanity—*pu* means \"all-encompassing,\" delivering all beings between heaven and earth.\nThe Three Origins nurture the Dao—heaven’s birth, earth’s completion, and humanity’s cultivation are the Three Origins’ nurturing of the Dao.\nThe Two Images embrace life—Qian and Kun’s creation, the generation of all things.\nFrom beginning to end, they govern and shape—thus called the Two Images embracing life.\n(Alternatively: Yin and Yang’s molding is the Two Images embracing life—both are correct.)\nRotten trees and dead roots—*xiu* means \"decayed,\" *gu* means \"dead.\"\nOnce withered, made to flourish—*ku* means \"dried up,\" once desiccated, made to bloom anew.\nAll creatures that creep and breathe, long life and transformed forms—\nflying, crawling, and creeping beings, none die prematurely, all transcend their original forms.\nThose with child or in gestation all achieve birth and completion—\nall beings in gestation, unharmed and unfallen, all attain peaceful growth and fulfillment.\nThe dead, their fate expired, souls return to the Three Clarities—\nthe deceased, spared the underworld, all return to heaven.\nTheir po spirits refined and delivered, ascend to the Southern Palace—\nthe seven po of the dead refined by the Great Compassionate Perfected, their souls and spirits ascend to the Southern Palace.\nToday is most auspicious—referring to the time of the scripture’s recitation.\nAll attain luminosity—all beings are saved, darkness dispelled by light.\nThe Five Emperors reflect and illumine—the Five Emperors of the Five Directions observe and shine.\nUniversally proclaiming to the myriad spirits—\nheavenly gods and earthly deities, all river sources,\nthe Five Peaks and Four Waterways, all famous mountains,\nCaverns of Mystery, Void, Emptiness, and Immortality—\nthe vast and empty caverns, all immortal emperors, gods, and buddhas, and ghostly generals.",

The path is severed, the Dao cut off—subtle and profound beyond thought, majestic and vast in scope, the foundation of all divine luminaries. It safeguards and stabilizes the realm, delivering beings from birth and death.\n\nWhen the August Heavenly Thearch had finished speaking these words, the pure assembly of the dharma gathering all gazed upward toward the Dao’s discourse, universally attaining enlightenment.\n\nAt that time, the August Heavenly Thearch bowed in reverence and extolled the Jade Emperor. Having recited the verses, he addressed the assembled host of celestial immortals, perfected beings, divine generals, and all others, saying: These are the wondrous dharma-words of the Jade Emperor.\n\nAll the immortal sages possess their own dharma-words—vast yet measurable, transmitted within limits. Some may know their beginning and end; some benefit the living but neglect the dead; some aid humans but forsake other beings; some are recognized by ghosts and spirits, while others fail to subdue demons and malevolent forces. Some remain formless and unknowing, unable to universally deliver—none are wondrous or sublime.\n\nYet the transformative power of this scripture is infinite, its majesty and benefit immeasurable. All receive its blessings—it is no ordinary teaching. These are the wondrous dharma-words of the Jade Emperor, the secret and arcane utterances of all the perfected sages.\n\nWhen the Primordial Beginning expounded this scripture, how could it be said that all the sages and most perfected ones who heard and received it did not treasure it, daring not to lightly disclose it? Thus it is called the \"secret of all the sages,\" the \"arcane words.\" The path is severed, the Dao cut off—this is the supreme vehicle. The dharma is rarely heard, the essential path of cultivating the real, the circuit of entering sagehood. Illusory desires and false thoughts—here, their roots are plucked. Love, attachments, and mundane thoughts—no longer sprout or spread. The cycles of rebirth and transmigration—severed in one stroke. Thus it is said: the path is severed, the Dao cut off. Another version states: the Seven Sages are all deluded, and this is a path humans find difficult to tread—this is also true.\n\nSubtle and profound beyond thought—deep, mysterious, and wondrous. The divine cannot be grasped by thought, nor entered through contemplation. The human mind’s reflections cannot easily reach it. Majestic and towering, the wondrous model of immortal verses, the true seal of the divine luminaries’ hearts. Another interpretation: the Jade Emperor’s Dao is the model, the ancestral teacher of all divine luminaries. This is too restrictive.\n\nIt safeguards and stabilizes the realm, delivering beings from birth and death.\n\nAt that time, the August Heavenly Thearch, having spoken these wondrous dharma-words up to the phrase \"delivering from birth and death,\"—the dharma gathering, the flower-adorned assembly; the pure assembly, the assembly of pure and sacred beings—all gazed upward toward the Dao’s discourse. Or, some take it as gazing upward toward the wondrous dharma-words of the August Heavenly Thearch. Universally attaining enlightenment, all achieved awakening.\n\n**Verification:**\nThe Master’s words on human nature and the Dao of Heaven cannot be heard. The *Wenshi Jing* states: \"Sages and the wise create delusion; even ghosts and spirits do not comprehend.\" When the Buddha expounded the dharma on Vulture Peak, the bodhisattvas listened with rapt attention. The Jade Emperor’s dharma-words—severed path, cut-off Dao, subtle and profound beyond thought—what doubt can there be? As the foundation of all divine luminaries, stabilizing the realm and delivering beings from birth and death—these are its natural effects.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nThere are no people beyond the Dao in the world, nor is there a Dao beyond people. Humans, beings, the hidden and the manifest—all are the Dao. Human nature is wholly real; all things are complete within it.

      "translated_text": "The two teachings speak of karmic retribution and penal suffering for no other purpose than to extricate beings from their karmic destinies and guide them toward supreme goodness. Alas! Only the sage, through the numinous Way of education, brings the multitudes to submission. The Jade Emperor’s virtue and power are supreme, and thus the scriptures clearly reveal karmic retribution to deliver beings from evil destinies—not to deceive the masses. If one does not cultivate the truth but merely dazzles others with talk of fortune and misfortune, this is deceit.\n\nThose who study the scriptures must sever desire to attain the real, escape the personal hell of evil, and only then may they save the world and deliver others.\n\n**Chapter on Verification of Responses, Continued (Chapter Twelve)**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Four Perfected Ones, saying: \"Among all the beings of the world—those who are stubborn, violent, and evil, the unvirtuous—who spend their days and nights before the images of the Dao, yet harbor no reverence in their hearts and utter slanderous words, such sins condemn them to the Five Uninterrupted Hells. If, however, they encounter one who upholds this scripture and employ various expedient means to guide and instruct them, such persons may extinguish their evil minds, believe in and turn toward this scripture, and their karmic offenses will be entirely purified without remainder.\"\n\nAt that time, the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning addressed the Four Perfected Ones—Compassionate Deliverance from Suffering and the others—saying: \"Among all the beings of the world—those who are stubborn, violent, and fierce, whose nature is bold and conduct coarse, the unvirtuous, whose words and deeds are wicked—who spend their days and nights (here, *jing* means ‘end,’ ‘exhaust’; they exhaust day and exhaust night) before the images of the Dao and the sacred likenesses of the gods, yet harbor no reverence in their hearts and utter slanderous words (*fei*: to criticize with words; *bang*: to defame with words), thus showing disrespect to the images of the Dao and slandering the sacred—such sins condemn them to the Five Uninterrupted Hells, the great hells of the netherworld. Without the methods of the sage, they inevitably fall into this retribution. Observe the laws of the world that punish those who slander heretical teachings, and you will understand the gravity of slandering the gods.\n\n\"If they encounter one who upholds this scripture (here, *zhi yu* means that at that time, they happen to meet), who employs various expedient methods of salvation to guide and instruct them—those who slander the gods and revile the Dharma, whose karmic roots are deep and heavy, who are obstinately deluded and lack faith—the upholder of the scripture, with great compassion and expedient means, awakens, guides, and transforms them, revealing their innate goodness and arousing their virtuous thoughts. Thus, those who slander the gods and revile the Dharma may extinguish all their evil minds, believe in and turn toward this scripture, take refuge with sincere faith, and devote themselves to it. Their karmic offenses (here, *bi* refers to those who slander the gods and revile the Dharma) will be entirely purified without remainder. As their karma dissolves and their sins vanish, all retribution is exhausted, and they are forever freed from transgression, never to return. Constantly pure and clean, their evil retribution is permanently removed, and no unresolved karma remains. Even in the Uninterrupted Hell, where karma is difficult to dissolve, if one wholeheartedly believes in and turns toward the true scripture, evil roots are severed at once, all defilements are extinguished, and what fetters remain? With roots and defilements instantly eradicated, karma is purified without remainder.\n\nThe virtue of the gods and the merit of the scriptures bring the greatest benefit. Both teachings emphatically speak of sin and blessing, earnestly revealing the gravity of the sin of disrespecting the gods and slandering the Dharma. Confucians likewise warn against flattery and irreverence toward the spirits—how could Confucians fail to revere the gods or honor the scriptures? The *Book of Songs* says: *\"Do not disgrace those who gave you life.\"* Master Zhang said: *\"To feel no shame in the solitude of one’s chamber is to not disgrace one’s origins.\"* He also said: *\"To preserve the mind and nurture one’s nature is to be unwavering.\"* Both teachings speak of revering the gods and honoring the scriptures to cultivate the mind and practice the Dao, feeling no shame before heaven, earth, and the gods, believing in the words of the Dharma, and embodying the Dao to attain the real.\n\nConfucians speak of not flattering the gods to caution against seeking blessings through irreverence. Serving Heaven, revering Heaven, aspiring to Heaven, honoring the words of the former kings, responding with reverent haste—Confucianism and the two teachings are one in this. If sacrifices bring no benefit and reverence is not practiced, if the Mandate of Heaven is not feared, these are corrupt words. Confucians also sternly reprove such views—how could this apply only to the two teachings?\n\nAlas! Good and evil, reverence and negligence—all arise from the mind. If one severs desire, relinquishes cunning knowledge, empties the five aggregates, and removes the five burdens, then one is no longer bound by the five phases. Heaven and earth cannot restrain them, so how could the Five Uninterrupted Hells ensnare them? The Buddha said: *\"By reciting the Buddha’s name, fire pits transform into lotus ponds.\"* Mencius said: *\"Recite the words of Yao and practice the deeds of Yao, and you are Yao.\"* Thus, the true efficacy of goodness is immediately manifest.\n\n*Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture, Volume Eight* concludes.\n*Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture, Volume Nine* begins.",

      "translated_text": "They fall into the great hells, the Avīci Hell, with no end to their confinement. *Permanent* means final, eternal. Those who recklessly slander the true Dharma plant deep karmic roots, and thus their fall into hell makes escape nearly impossible.\n\nAll perception is one. If perception is not upright, it becomes perverse. All people are one; if they cling to delusion and fail to awaken, they become foolish and wicked. The heart is one; if it generates evil thoughts, it becomes rebellious. The eyes are one; if they cast biased, perverse glances, they become transgressive. A single thought, however minute, is one; if it gives rise to an evil intention, it becomes the root of karma. A single word, however slight, is one; if it utters an evil speech, it becomes the source of sin.\n\nThe noble person perfects the beauty of unity, commending others’ goodness. Those who uphold the scripture should be praised; to recklessly generate slander is to create one’s own suffering. Human life is originally free of karma, yet one invites grave sin upon oneself—how deeply lamentable.\n\nThe end of life is the return of the borrowed vessel of creation, naturally unbound. Yet for one who slanders the Dharma, even death brings no peace. How endless is their suffering, with no hope of escape.\n\nThe heart of Heaven is benevolent; the Supreme Deity cherishes life. The spirits are upright and do not abandon people. Yet if the sinner has no end to their confinement, is it Heaven that restrains them? No—calamity is self-made, and fixed karma is inescapable.\n\nTo dissolve one’s own karma, one must return to self-faith. Unwavering devotion to supreme goodness severs the root of karma. Alas! Heaven’s punishment is impartial; the law has no favorites. A compassionate father cannot shield his son, nor can a filial son protect his father. The spirits are perfectly just—how could they absolve self-inflicted karma?\n\nThose who believe in the scripture and turn toward the Dharma may repent of past transgressions, just as a worldly person who confesses sincerely may be spared punishment. In this world, the sagely and the foolish are not inherently different. If one cannot speak with eloquence, let their voice at least follow the rhythm of the law; if one cannot avoid uttering false words, let them at least refrain from evil speech. If one cannot act without fault, let their body at least serve as a vessel for liberation; if one cannot avoid wrongdoing, let them at least refrain from creating bodily karma. If one cannot guard against delusive thoughts, let them at least preserve their utmost sincerity; if one cannot avoid evil intentions, let them at least refrain from creating mental karma.\n\nIf one does not understand the great Dao, let them not slander it. If one cannot comprehend the scripture, let them not reject it. If one cannot recite or uphold it, let them not slander others. If one does not understand spirits, life and death, or cause and effect, let them not utter defamatory words. With a heart of upright faith, clarity in the Dao will naturally arise over time, gradually attaining sagehood and transcendence—what karma or sin could then remain?\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Verification of Retribution Continued**\n\nAs for men and women in the world who encounter this scripture yet fail to revere it, handling it with filthy hands, reciting it with impure mouths, or placing it upon unclean beds and couches—those who, while reciting or expounding it, engage in vulgar speech and frivolous laughter, treating it as an ordinary text—such people, after their lives end, will fall into the Avīci Hell with no hope of escape. Their misfortune will extend to nine generations of ancestors, who will suffer interrogation in Fengdu. Their sins will burden their descendants, afflicting future generations.\n\nIn hell, they will endure immeasurable kalpas of immense suffering. Even if they encounter the sacred teachings and receive repeated salvation, their sins will only slightly diminish. If they further receive the extraordinary mercy of the highest sages, they may escape hell, only to be reborn among the hungry ghosts. For thousands of myriads of kalpas, they will not even hear the name of water or broth. Once their ghostly retribution is exhausted, they will be reborn as animals. After their animal retribution is complete, if they are reborn as humans, they will again appear in remote barbarian lands, as women, in poverty and hardship, afflicted with chronic illnesses and disabilities, enduring boundless suffering. They will be despised and rejected by all, unable to live in peace or die in ease. Such is the gravity of the sin incurred by treating this scripture lightly.\n\nThis is the retribution for disrespecting the scripture. *Failing to revere* means lacking respect and admiration. *Handling with filthy hands* refers to touching or flipping through the scripture with unclean hands, thereby defiling it. *Reciting with an impure mouth* means chanting or upholding it after consuming the five pungent vegetables, the five spices, or the three tabooed meats. *Placing it upon unclean beds or couches* means setting the scripture on dirty tables, seats, or platforms. *Engaging in vulgar speech and frivolous laughter* means discussing it in common language and treating it as a trivial text.\n\nSuch people not only bring sin upon themselves but also extend calamity to nine generations of ancestors—the four paternal uncles, the four maternal uncles, and the first ancestor. *Suffering interrogation in Fengdu* refers to the examination of transgressions, or the torture of interrogation. This reflects the principle that when a minor ghost commits a crime, the household head is held accountable. *Burdening descendants* means that the sins of an unvirtuous family linger, bringing endless suffering and affliction.\n\nIf they encounter the sacred teachings and receive repeated salvation, their sins may slightly diminish—this is the merit of the scripture and the Dharma. If they receive the extraordinary mercy of the highest sages, it is the pardon of the Supreme Deity, allowing them to escape the suffering of hell. Yet as hungry ghosts, they will endure thousands of myriads of kalpas without even hearing the name of water or broth. Hungry ghosts have vast bellies and narrow throats, making it impossible to consume food or drink. In the dark hells of Fengdu, they neither see nor hear of water or broth.\n\nThere is no creature more foolish than animals. Once their ghostly retribution is exhausted, they are reborn among them, their karma still unresolved. Though human existence is one, rebirth in the Central Kingdom is rare, and obtaining a male body is difficult. They will be born in remote barbarian lands, as women—among the least favored of human forms—enduring poverty, cold, hunger, and hardship, afflicted with chronic illnesses and disabilities, suffering boundless torment. They will be despised and rejected, unable to live in peace or die in ease—all due to their disrespect for this scripture. The gravity of their sin is truly lamentable.\n\nHuman life is one of the Three Powers, alongside Heaven and Earth. This body is precious, entrusted to us to continue our lineage, honor our ancestors, and benefit descendants. The Dao depends on it for transmission—its significance is not trivial.

How can it not be agonizing?\n\nGrieving their suffering, we also mourn their folly—this is the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nIf even a single act of disdain for this scripture incurs boundless retribution, then revering the Dao and believing in the scripture must be a matter of constancy. Through long cultivation, the transformative power of the Dao is perfected, and the efficacy of the scripture is fully realized, bestowing its virtue and manifesting its effects. Yet people, lacking steadfastness, begin with diligence but end in indolence—no wonder sin and karma befall them.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, those of inferior capacity abound—many neither uphold nor even hear the scripture, yet suffer misfortunes and calamities. Are they all guilty of disdaining the scripture? The scripture speaks of the Dao; to disbelieve in the Dao is to lack virtue, which is itself the sin of disdaining the scripture. Without virtue, there is sin—this is the sin of disdaining the scripture. To revere the scripture and dissolve sin, one must advance in the Dao and cultivate virtue.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen of the \"Manifestations of Efficacy\" Continued:**\nYou should diligently and earnestly follow and practice this without fail, refraining from all perverse thoughts. If all thoughts cease to arise, the myriad conditions instantly subside, and the dust-like evil karma dissolves with the heart. All disasters and demonic influences naturally vanish. The merit of this scripture is inconceivable—it is truly the unparalleled, supreme, and wondrous Dharma, the king of all scriptures, of immense benefit, not to be shown to the unworthy.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said to the Perfected Ones: Such is the retribution for the sin of disdaining the scripture. You should diligently and earnestly follow and practice this scriptural Dharma without fail, refraining from all perverse thoughts. If all杂念 cease to arise—no good thoughts, no evil thoughts, no thought of no-thought, no thought of no-no-thought—the myriad conditions instantly subside. The five aggregates are emptied, the nine consciousnesses dissolved, the four images transcended, the hundred errors severed, the ten thousand existences voided, and the mind extinguished into utter nothingness. External conditions, internal conditions, karmic conditions, blessed conditions, and the wondrous condition of emptiness—along with attachments to past lives, the present, and future rebirths—are all cut off, their roots and dust fully exhausted. The dust-like evil karma, as countless as the sands of the Ganges, dissolves with the believing heart. All disasters and demonic influences naturally perish. Such is the inconceivable merit of this scripture—truly the unparalleled, supreme, and wondrous Dharma, without equal among the Three Teachings or the ten thousand methods. It is the king of all scriptures, surpassing even the Confucian classics. It is the sovereign of all scriptures across the Three Teachings, of immense benefit, not to be shown to the unworthy. Though the Dao may be learned by all, it must not be transmitted to those who lack faith and reverence—it is not to be shown to the unworthy, nor imparted to those who do not honor the Dao.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nConfucians do not instruct those who abandon themselves to despair. Buddhas do not save those without affinity. The Daoist Dharma is most exalted—how could it be forced upon the faithless? Alas, faith is the foundation of advancing in the Dao, and true resolve is the essence of attaining sagehood. Without faith, the scripture cannot be transmitted. One must be utterly sincere and resolute, for this is the root of receiving the scripture and entering sagehood.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen of the \"Manifestations of Efficacy\" Continued:**\nIf the gods and humans of the heavens, afflicted by the five decays and four signs, pressed by the cycle of rebirth, can abandon delusive thoughts and uphold this scripture, they will naturally attain celestial blessings, their heavenly fortune secured. They will transcend the Three Realms and abide with the Dao forever. This scripture is most exalted—it must not be recklessly shown to others.\n\nAmong the gods and humans, the six heavens of the Desire Realm still indulge in sensual pleasures. The eighteen heavens of the Form Realm abide in form. The four heavens of the Formless Realm delight in the emptiness of meditative absorption. The four Great Brahma heavens know emptiness and nothingness, though they lack desire for pleasure, their tranquil blessings are still finite. Beyond these heavens, the four highest heavens of the Seed People are free from the cycles of formation and dissolution. The heavens below them, though differing in rank, are subject to formation and dissolution.\n\n**The Five Decays and Four Signs:**\nThe five decays have been explained earlier. The four signs refer to the decline of the marks of non-self, non-person, non-sentient being, and non-lifespan, or the decline of blessed marks and virtuous marks, divided into four phases. Another interpretation holds that the four signs are birth, prime, aging, and death. Yet another defines them as loss of dignity, loss of supernatural powers, loss of joy, and loss of vitality.\n\n**The Cycle of Rebirth Pressing Upon Them:**\nThe thirty-two heavens of the Desire, Form, Brahma, and Formless Realms vary in duration. When the blessings of their heavenly beings are exhausted, they are reborn among humans, each according to their allotted span—hence the cycle of rebirth.\n\n**Abandoning Delusive Thoughts:**\nDelusive thoughts arise from following conditions—whether thoughts of blessings, wisdom, longevity, emptiness, absorption, ascent, or descent. The mind’s endless fabrications, beyond enumeration, are all called delusive thoughts. To abandon them is to cast aside all杂念, leaving no single condition to arise, attaining utter emptiness—this is the relinquishing of illusory thoughts. By abandoning delusive thoughts, one naturally attains celestial blessings, their heavenly fortune further secured, without need for striving.",

      "translated_text": "The realms of Desire, Form, Formless, and Brahma are each their own dwelling, yet from them one may attain liberation—forever free from the cycle of rebirth, immune to decay and dissolution, achieving great steadfastness beyond the wheel of existence. The body transcends the Three Realms. By rising above the Desire Realm, one ascends through the Form Realm, the Formless Realm, and the Brahma Realm, surpassing the worlds of heaven, earth, and humanity, emerging from the three conditioned states to soar into the highest, mysterious celestial bounds. Abiding with the Dao in perpetuity, merging with the true Dao, enduring through infinite kalpas.\n\nThe effects of the *Treasure Sutra of Heavenly Beings* may thus be known to the world. Take heed.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Verification of Efficacy**\nThis scripture is unmatched, unsurpassed—possessing great majesty and power, a divine incantation of profound efficacy. It can cause all withered stalks to sprout branches and leaves, to blossom with flowers and bear fruit in lush abundance. It dispels the most grievous suffering of sentient beings and grants longevity to those of short lifespan. The merits of this scripture are inconceivable, its praises beyond exhaustion.\n\nThose who disbelieve in this scripture incur karmic consequences as described; those who trust in it, whether heavenly beings or humans, witness its effects as proclaimed. This scripture stands without equal—all other sutras and dharmas fall beneath it, unrivaled in kind, unmatched in excellence. No other teaching can compare; none surpass its benefits.\n\nIt is of great majesty and power, for it both dispels evil and upholds the true. A teaching that cannot encompass both is not called majestic. This scripture eradicates evil and dissolves transgressions, supports the upright and perfects the real—such divine and wondrous virtue, its grace and might immeasurable, is thus called majesty and power.\n\nA divine incantation of the highest order, as explained before: it can cause all withered stalks to sprout branches and leaves, to flourish with flowers and fruit. All grasses, trees, rare blossoms, exotic herbs, auspicious fungi, and sacred fragrances—any living thing that fails to thrive, any that withers or decays—this scripture restores to life, reviving branches, leaves, blossoms, and fruit in luxuriant abundance.\n\nIt dispels the most grievous suffering of sentient beings. This scripture dissolves karmic obstructions, benefiting life; it uproots transgressions, aiding in death. It averts demonic calamities, safeguarding joy. Through eons of enmity and desire, lifelong afflictions, the heaviest of sorrows, and burdens accumulated over lifetimes—this scripture severs their very roots.\n\nIt grants longevity to those of short lifespan. Among mortals, seventy years is rare. This scripture preserves life and extends years, allowing those who perish young or are fated for brief lives to add to their allotted span and attain longevity. Some may ask: Yan Hui, a near-sage, died at thirty—did his virtue not benefit him? How then can this scripture extend life? For one who dies yet does not perish is truly long-lived. Having attained the Dao in clarity, Yan Hui did not die. The scripture’s power to prolong short lives enables beings to perceive the Dao and thus transcend death without perishing.\n\nThe merits of this scripture are inconceivable, its praises beyond exhaustion.",

Hence, it is called the *root of the Dao*.

The *Daoist Scriptures* state: \"The Great Dao has no name.\" Through refined cultivation, it is perfected.

      "translated_text": "Those who cultivate worldly fields may face droughts, floods, or human mismanagement, resulting in poor harvests. But those who cultivate the fields of blessings—whether in small or great measure—shall reap small or great rewards. The hidden virtues are manifold; even if one remains unaware or their enumeration is inexhaustible, their merit is boundless. Should one fail to cultivate these fields of blessings, they may not even hear the name of this scripture. Without virtue or fortune, the scripture’s name remains unheard.\n\nAs the scripture states, the true Dharma is rarely encountered—this is what it means. How much more so to behold this scripture itself? To see this true scripture is to possess the Dao-eye. Without virtue or fortune, its name goes unheard; how then could one hope to see it?\n\nEach person’s capacity differs, as does their reception. Some possess fortune but lack virtue—wealthy and noble yet foolish. Others possess virtue but lack fortune—poor yet sagely. When virtue and fortune flourish together, one attains rank, longevity, and renown. Should one encounter the true Dharma and gain insight into liberation, it is not through mere kalpas of cultivation or boundless merit that such a state is reached.\n\nAt a gathering of a million buddhas, the true Dharma was entrusted to Mahākāśyapa. Among Confucius’ three thousand disciples, the unifying principle was passed to Zeng Shen. In the Daoist tradition, though its followers number in the millions, only Wenshi inherited the heart of the Most High.\n\nLet the reader take heed.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Verification**\n\nThis scripture adheres to the true standards of the Three Caverns. It is transmitted but once in eighty thousand kalpas—a treasure cherished by the perfected sages of the Pure Capital, secreted within the Golden Towers of the Jade Capital. Most wondrous and subtle, it is rarely encountered. Only those with the bone of immortality—destined to become true immortals of the Nine Heavens—may chance upon this text. Having met with this opportunity, they shall later present gold and treasures to their master, swear oaths, and receive it. Only then, when the time is ripe and fate aligns, may it be transmitted. It must not be lightly disclosed; revere it, guard it well. This scripture is not to be casually passed on.\n\nIt adheres to the true standards of the Three Caverns: the Cavern of Truth, the Cavern of Mystery, and the Cavern of Spirit—these three ranks are recorded in the celestial statutes and golden precepts. The \"true standards\" are the natural principles. \"Eighty thousand kalpas\" refers to the cycles of cosmic renewal spanning eighty thousand great kalpas. One tradition holds that human life begins at *yin* and ends at *you*, with eight periods totaling 86,400 years—roughly eighty thousand years. Each cycle of growth, harvest, and renewal is called a kalpa. \"Sand\" signifies innumerable grains. The transmission of this scripture once in eighty thousand kalpas marks the turning of the great Dharma-wheel—an exceedingly rare occurrence. The earlier explanation is nearly correct.\n\nThis is a treasure of the perfected sages of the Pure Capital of Supreme Clarity, secreted within the Golden Towers of the Jade Capital—not the abode of the Jade Emperor, but the repository of the *Tai Xuan Bao Zang Di Jing*. Most wondrous and subtle, its praises extol the difficulty of encountering it. Only those with the bone of immortality—those who have cultivated in past lives and possess the destiny of transcendence—may become true immortals of the Nine Heavens. Having met with this text and this karmic connection, they shall later present gold and treasures to their master, swear oaths, and receive it. This is not merely the offering of worldly gold and treasures, but the pledge of a heart utterly sincere and selfless, unwavering for all kalpas—a vow sworn before heaven and earth, as pure as the midday sun, untarnished by even a speck of dust. Such is true, indestructible gold.\n\nOnly then, when the moment arrives and fate aligns, may it be transmitted. It must not be lightly disclosed. To \"disclose\" is to leak; the scripture’s essence must not be carelessly revealed, nor shared with the unworthy. Revere it, guard it well. Alas! Knowing the weight of this scripture, all should cultivate good karma as the foundation for receiving it. Once received, it must never be treated lightly. Treasure it, strive for it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Verification (continued)**\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy expounded this meaning again and spoke in verse:\n\n*Were the waters of rivers and streams*\n*To bear lotuses in their waves,*\n*Or the feathers of kind crows turn white—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were turtles to grow fur,*\n*Fine enough for robes and garments,*\n*Or the moon at night melt ice—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were the legs of gnats and midges*\n*Strong enough to build bridges,*\n*To bear all manner of weight—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were fledgling sparrows*\n*Able to carry great mountains,*\n*And cast them to distant lands—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were a single leaf of a boat*\n*To bear the weight of Kunlun,*\n*And ferry it across the sea—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were leeches to grow tusks,*\n*As large as an elephant’s,*\n*From their very mouths—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were the leaves of mugwort*\n*To cover boundless realms,*\n*And shade the Kunlun peaks—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were crows and owls*\n*To nest together in one tree,*\n*Feeding and nurturing one another—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were rabbits to grow horns,*\n*Fit for ladders to the heavens,*\n*To climb to the very summit—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were mice to climb*\n*Those rabbit-horn ladders,*\n*And devour the moon in the sky—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were donkeys’ lips*\n*To turn the hue of *pingpo* fruit,*\n*And sing and dance as well—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\n*Were flies and insects*\n*To drink barrels of wine,*\n*And grow drunk and lost—*\n*This scripture would still be hard to meet.*\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded again the merit of the scripture and spoke in verse:\n\n*Were the waters of rivers and streams*\n*To bear lotuses in their waves...*\n\nThe rivers run deep, their currents vast and waves towering—yet they cannot bear lotuses. The feathers of kind crows are naturally black—yet they cannot turn white.

      "translated_text": "Turtles are naturally without fur, and the moon is inherently the Great Yin. To speak of gathering turtle fur for clothing or melting ice with the night moon is but to describe the utterly nonexistent—thus illustrating the extreme rarity of encountering this scripture. Moreover, to say that the legs of mosquitoes and midges could construct bridges to bear heavy loads; that fledglings with yellow beaks could carry great mountains and cast them into other realms; that a small boat could ferry Mount Kunlun across the vast sea; or that leeches could grow the tusks of elephants—leeches being but tiny water insects—these too are impossibilities. Or that the leaves of mugwort and reeds could cover boundless worlds and shade Mount Kunlun; that crows and owls, both ill-omened birds, could nest together and feed one another in filial reciprocity; that rabbit horns could serve as ladders to ascend to heaven; that a shrew could climb such a ladder to reach the heavens and devour the moon; that donkeys’ lips could turn the hue of *pingpo* fruit and sing and dance; or that flies and insects could drink barrels of wine and grow drunk and lost—all these are things that must never exist, principles that have never been. Yet they are recounted in detail to show how difficult it is to encounter this scripture.\n\nThe Great Dao is possessed by all, and the true scripture is complete in each. Even the foolish and the dull-witted have their correct nature and may all be transformed and delivered—why then compare the rarity of this scripture to such impossibilities? Could it truly never be transmitted? The answer lies in the hierarchy of teachings: this scripture is the most exalted. Those who transmit it may not embody the truth of the Primordial Beginning, and those who receive it may not grasp the secrets of the Jade Emperor. With obstructions and biases, the full scripture remains obscure. Some may never hear or see it; others may hear or see it in vain, their understanding of its merit and efficacy left vague. Without attaining its full benefit, one must indeed acknowledge its rarity.\n\nYet the difficulty of difficulty need not be feared. With utmost sincerity and reverence, the merit of the scripture will naturally be met.\n\n**Chapter 22: Manifestations of Response (Continued)**\nThen the Heavenly Worthy, having expounded the verse, addressed the four assemblies: Should there be one in the world who upholds this scripture, they are called a *Body of Merit and Virtue*, for all sentient beings are sheltered beneath their shade. They are called a *Body of Spiritual Penetration*, for all auspicious signs gather in their presence. They are called a *Body of Purity*, for no evil karma can assail them.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning, having expounded the verse, addressed the four assemblies. *Pu* means \"all-pervading\"; the *four assemblies* have been explained previously.\n\nShould there be one in the world who upholds this scripture, they are called a *Body of Merit and Virtue*. That which benefits others is *merit*; that which enriches others is *virtue*. To benefit all beings without exception is to embody the wondrous merit and mysterious virtue of the profound Dao. All sentient beings—whether in the realms of the moving or the growing, all that has life, even earth, wood, metal, and stone, so long as they possess essence and spirit—are sheltered beneath their shade. The sages of the Three Teachings universally ferry and eternally benefit all. *Yin* means \"to cover.\" The upholder of the scripture benefits self and others, humans and things, the knowing and the unknowing, bestowing universal grace—all are enveloped in their compassionate shade.\n\nThey are called a *Body of Spiritual Penetration*. Though humans are the most spiritually endowed, they possess no spiritual penetration. The wondrous Dharma within this scripture is supremely profound and divine, unobstructedly transcendent—thus the upholder of this true scripture is called a *Body of Spiritual Penetration*. All auspicious signs gather in their presence. The sages of the Three Teachings are eternally perfected and indestructible. *Xian* means \"all\"; *zhen* means \"to arrive\"; *ji* means \"to assemble.\" The upholder of the scripture, in their own conduct, is harmonious and auspicious; in their dealings with others, they are loving and impartial; in their governance of the world and the state, they are never misplaced. The blessings they attain are manifold, with a thousand auspicious signs converging. Heaven does not withhold the Dao; Earth does not hoard its treasures. People submit to their transformation; things respond to their numinous power—all auspicious signs gather in their presence.\n\nThey are called a *Body of Purity*. That which is unstained is *pure*; that which is unburdened is *clear*. The upholder of the scripture quiets all entanglements, leaving not a single flaw—thus no evil can assail them. *Qin* means \"to encroach and harm.\" Whether self-inflicted karma, heavenly calamities, past transgressions, or present faults; whether the misfortunes of ancestors or the obstructions of the times; whether the afflictions of fate, the clashes of stellar positions, the assaults of demons and ghosts, the slander of people, or the malevolence of things—all such evil karma is transformed from inauspicious to auspicious, unable to encroach or harm. The person of the Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, nurturing all beings. Their blessings and felicity are everlasting, and Heaven’s protection never wanes. The virtuous are aided by Heaven, free from disaster and harm—truly a *Body of Merit, Spiritual Penetration, and Purity*. Those who merely possess a body but lack merit, spiritual penetration, and purity do not truly uphold the scripture. Strive on, and one may verify its efficacy for oneself.\n\n**Chapter 23: Manifestations of Response (Continued)**\nThey are called a *Body of Majestic Virtue*, for neither heavenly demons nor heterodox paths can subdue them. They are called a *Body Without Equal*, for the Supreme Emperor extols them from afar, and all spirits revere them.\n\nThe upholder of this scripture is not only called a *Body of Purity* but also a *Body of Majestic Virtue* (as explained previously). *Heavenly demons and heterodox paths* include the demon kings of the heavens, demonic men and women, dark and shadowy demons, asuras, *gusiluo*, *chi*, *mei*, *wangliang*, spirits, deviants, specters, and malevolent forces—along with the deceptions of worldly people, the heresies of external paths, and all manner of inauspicious, seductive, and aberrant influences. *Cannot subdue*: *She* means \"to summon, tame, and subjugate.\" When demons and heterodox forces invade, people are deluded and submit unknowingly—this is called *she*. For example, in the Buddhist tradition, Ānanda was ensnared by the courtesan Matangi and nearly violated his precepts. Yet the upholder of this scripture, having awakened to the seal of the mind, is selfless and non-attached, silently upholding the true scripture. Their Dharma power is complete, their Dao lofty, and their virtue weighty—majestic and radiant beyond measure. Ghosts and demons lose their courage; spirits and specters vanish without form. How could any evil or demon dare to assail the upright? Thus, *heavenly demons and heterodox paths cannot subdue them*. Ānanda, though upholding the precepts, was moved by a single thought toward Matangi—having not yet awakened to the essence of the mind and lacking the scripture’s guidance, he was ensnared by her.",
      "overlap_context": "e Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded again the merit of the scripture and spoke in verse:\n\n*Were the waters of rivers and streams*\n*To bear lotuses in their waves...*\n\nThe rivers run deep, their currents vast and waves towering—yet they cannot bear lotuses. The feathers of kind crows are naturally black—yet they cannot turn white. To speak of white crows or lotus-bearing rivers is to describe the impossible, and thus to illustrate the extreme rarity of encountering this scripture.",

      "translated_text": "Were it not for the power of the Buddha’s *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, how could one preserve their entire being? This *August Scripture* is the sovereign among all scriptures, and the majestic virtue of its upholders is ten thousand times greater than that of other scriptures. Those who uphold this scripture are not merely called *majestic-virtue bodies*; they are called *bodies beyond compare*—bodies without equal, without peer, without counterpart. Truly so.\n\nThe upholders of this scripture stand supreme, with none to rival them. As the scriptural commentary states: *\"Nothing compares to the Buddha.\"* The Confucian texts say: *\"The Master’s unattainability is like the heavens—one cannot ascend by steps.\"* The distant chant of the Heavenly Emperors—here, *Heavenly Emperors* does not refer to the Jade Emperor but to the Emperors of all heavens—*distant* meaning far, *chant* signifying the celestial proclamation praising those who advance in the Dao. Some interpret *chant* as *ballad*, implying song, but this is contextually unsound and should not be followed. For when a boy is born in the world, the myriad spirits chant in reverence; when a girl is born, the myriad spirits chant in service. The Heavenly Emperors cherish life, and all heavens rejoice. The person of the Dao, whose sincerity moves heaven and earth and stirs ghosts and spirits, harmonizes their virtue with heaven—thus do the Heavenly Emperors celebrate. Yet these Emperors are most exalted, unlike other spirits; from their celestial palaces, they merely hear the distant celestial tones in joy, not the words of song. Otherwise, why would this text first speak of the *distant chant of the Heavenly Emperors* and then of the *reverence of the myriad spirits*? The *myriad spirits*—not one but many—encompass all spirits, high and low, who all revere the sacred canon. When they encounter a true upholder of the scripture, a person of the Dao, none fail to show respect.\n\nHuman nature is inherently firm, luminous, centered, and harmonious, standing shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning, inherently possessing great majestic virtue beyond compare. Yet if one cannot restrain emotions and desires, evil enters, and the spirits do not revere them. Alas! Zixia was a worthy man, yet upon seeing splendor and beauty, he was delighted—had he not received the true teaching of the Master, how could he have become a lofty disciple? If one can remain single-mindedly true without pretense, they shall forever attain the Dao.\n\n**Verification Chapter, Continuation of the Twenty-Fourth Section**\n\nThose who uphold this scripture are called *indestructible bodies*, for great calamities and dire perils cannot harm them. Those who uphold this scripture are called *Dao-treasury bodies*, for when they speak, ghosts and spirits look up in reverence.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture are not merely called *bodies beyond compare*; they are called *indestructible bodies*. The lives of worldly people are impermanent, their cycles of rebirth unknowable. Some achieve minor merits and minor virtues, their blessings and destinies limited; some cultivate minor roots and minor vehicles, their fruition constrained; some are enlightened yet not fully clear, easily obscured and deceived; some practice yet do not perfect, easily interrupted and severed; some save others and relieve suffering, yet their capacity is quickly exhausted. Their bodies are like duckweed or candle flames, unable to withstand wind and waves—such is not indestructibility. The true upholder of the scripture, whose mind never regresses, is called an *indestructible body*; thus, great calamities and dire perils cannot harm them. Whether in minor, medium, or great kalpas—through cosmic cycles, worldly transformations, the destruction and renewal of the Three Realms, the annihilation of all beings, the collapse of earth and sky, the collision of the four wheels, the mutual conquest of the five phases, the disasters of water, fire, and wind that ravage the world, the dissolution of all phenomena, the exhaustion of all dharmas, the fruitions of all vehicles, the four dhyāna heavens, the three ranks and nine grades, the officials, spirits, generals, and clerks—all are swept into the cycle of rebirth, facing the tribulation of recreation. Yet the true upholder of the scripture attains great indestructibility, transcending kalpas and cycles, never regressing. Whether in the calamities of cosmic cycles, the disasters of past karma, or unforeseen great perils, not even a hair’s breadth can encroach upon them. They remain steadfast through constancy and change, unwavering for aeons—unharmed.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture are not merely called *indestructible bodies*; they are called *Dao-treasury bodies*. *Treasury* means to store, to treasure. The Dao encompasses all, and there is nothing it does not perfect. The *Dao-treasury* contains all without omission, treasuring all without exception. Though the human body is limited, the nature is boundless. Yet if one does not fully realize the Dao, they do not become a *Dao-body*. The true upholder of the scripture, profound as the abyss and vast as the sea, contains within their Dharma-treasury infinite worlds—thus are they called *Dao-treasury bodies*. When they speak, ghosts and spirits look up in reverence. *Answering and expounding* is called *speech*; *self-expression* is called *words*.",

Great benevolence and boundless grace—this is what is meant by *compassion*. Yet people, divided by the distinction between self and other, their minds set on the fleeting and the lasting, not only fail to universally bestow eternal benefit, thus falling short of compassion; even when they grant favors or deliver others, their aid is limited and impermanent—this, too, is not the *Body of Compassion*.

The Heavenly Path stands lofty and exalted, its blessings pure and enduring, yet its origins unseen—how can its numbers be counted? Though heaven is high, it still encompasses the Three Realms: desire, form, and formlessness, all subject to arising and decay. Even if their blessings vary in duration, apart from the lords of each heaven, only those who uphold the true Dao endure. As for the myriad heavenly beings and all their kinds, none abide forever; all have beginning and end, and thus are called *sentient beings*.\n\nThe Human Path: humanity is the spirit of the ten thousand things. Though they praise transformation and nurture, propagate the great Dao and its teachings, their stations differ in nobility, their forms in male and female, their numbers teeming like forests, beyond reckoning—these, too, are called *sentient beings*.\n\nThe Asura Path: the demon kings of heaven, demon subjects, demon women, spirits and deviants, monstrosities and portents—these are the demonic kinds of sentient beings.\n\nThe Hell Path: the Five Uninterrupted Hells, the Nine Dark Hells, the Eighteen Great Hells, the Thirty-Six Hells, the Seventy-Two Hells—all their suffering and torment belong to the hellish kinds of sentient beings.\n\nThe Hungry Ghost Path: the gloomy depths of Fengdu, the mighty ghost kings, ghost messengers, those with elongated limbs and massive heads, distended bellies and slender throats, who for ten thousand kalpas never hear the sound of broth or water—these are the hungry ghost kinds of sentient beings.\n\nThe Animal Path: those born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation; creatures of feather, fur, scale, or shell; all their dull and mindless forms—these are the animal kinds of sentient beings.\n\nAll bear the merciful grace of the scripture’s upholder, who lifts them, delivers them, and shelters them. Thus, he secures the blessings of heaven and humanity, resolves the calamities of the human realm, releases those sunk in demonic and hellish realms, and extinguishes the retributions of ghosts and beasts. In one world, ten thousand worlds, or the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds, the beings of the Six Paths, freed from karmic bonds and enriched in blessings, rely upon his goodness. This is called *compassion*.\n\nTo speak of the Six Paths is to encompass all kinds; to speak of sentient beings is to encompass all multitudes. All worlds are thus—from the beginningless past to the endless future, all that is beyond thought and measure relies upon the goodness of one who truly upholds the scripture. Truly, this is *great compassion*!\n\nAlas! First deliver oneself, then deliver others. To save the beings of the Six Paths, one must forever uphold the true scripture, perfecting supreme goodness before it is possible.\n\n**Chapter on Verification, Continuation Twenty-Six**\n\nOne who upholds this scripture is called the *Great Dao Body*, for wherever he goes, he knows no fear.\n\nOne who upholds this scripture is not merely called the *Body of Compassion*, but the *Great Dao Body*. The Dao is originally formless, while the human body has shape. Human nature contains the Dao in its entirety, possessing the principles of heaven and earth and their qi. If one speaks of the *Dao Body*, then all people possess the Dao, yet none fully realize it—thus, the body born of father and mother may simply be called the *human body*. The Four Great Elements disperse, so it may be called the *illusory body*. It remains material and untransformed, so it may be called the *ordinary body*. Living in drunkenness and dreaming, it may be called the *unaware body*. Rushing about from dawn to dusk, content to age and die, it may be called the *karmic body*. Without cultivation or learning, trapped in the cycle of rebirth, it may be called the *sinful body*. Like autumn fragrance, fleeting and brief, it may be called the *sensory body*. Male and female differ in form, old and young in appearance, so it may be called the *impermanent body*. When the great limit arrives, even the six relations cannot be relied upon, so it may be called the *lonely body*. Assailed by wind and rain, heat and cold, it may be called the *suffering body*. Such is the body of one who lacks the Dao.\n\nOne who truly upholds the scripture, attaining the Dharma and becoming perfected, is the *Dao Body*—no ordinary body, but the *Great Dao Body*. Wherever he goes, he knows no fear.\n\n*Fear* is alarm and anxiety; *dread* is terror. Only one who upholds the scripture, called the *Great Dao Body*, moves with ease when going out and carries no burden when returning. Whether coming or going, he is pure, liberated, and at peace—always serene. What worry, what fear? Wherever he is, he knows no fear.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nThe Confucians say: *\"Be cautious in what you do not see, fearful in what you do not hear.\"* Is not caution and fear itself a kind of dread? Moreover, the seven emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, terror, and shock—reside in every person. Yet it is said that wherever one goes, he knows no fear—does this not contradict caution and fear?\n\nIt is not so. Caution and fear restrain human desire to preserve the true Dao. The seven emotions demonstrate the full functioning of human nature, guiding people to subdue their passions and return to their nature. But if the heart of dread arises from inner instability, giving rise to external calamity, and one is seized by terror, this is not the proper way. Thus, the Master said: *\"Look within and find no fault—what worry, what fear?\"* Wherever he goes, he knows no fear, for body and Dao are one, and all he encounters is peace. What fear could there be?\n\nThe Confucians also say: *\"Seeing the great, the heart is at peace.\"* This and the above illuminate each other. For one who upholds the scripture, fearlessness in coming and going is natural—not forced.",

It is because one gain becomes eternal gain, a truth proven in principle. The fault lies only in not truly upholding the scripture.\n\nWhat does *true upholding* entail? A heart of fasting as the foundation, transformed and perfected by spirit.\n\n*Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture, Scroll Nine* concludes.\n*Collected Commentaries on the August Scripture, Scroll Ten* begins.",

How excellent are the teachings of both traditions on the study of the heart: *\"Thusness, naturalness, majestic immovability\"*—the way of spiritual transformation is fully contained therein. If one clings through effort, no spontaneous transformation occurs, and the practice cannot endure. Seeking quick results, even without fear, still does not accord with the scripture’s meaning.\n\n**Verification Chapter, Continuation of Chapter 27**\nOne who upholds this scripture is called the \"Good Physician of the Body,\" for they skillfully practice the wondrous Dharma to bring peace and joy to others.

With medicine, they dispel sickness and sustain life, earning names like \"divine,\" \"sagely,\" \"masterful,\" or \"skillful.\"\n\nThe true upholder of this scripture is no worldly physician, nor any ordinary healer, nor one who speaks of elixirs from distant shores. Silently transmitting the golden needle, they are called the \"Good Physician of the Body.\" Skillfully practicing the wondrous Dharma, they address the myriad conditions of human life: countless beings with tangled qi and temperament, qi losing its balance, bearing illnesses from birth, visible ailments, invisible afflictions, personal suffering, familial distress, the troubles of a nation or the world, the woes of an age, or the karmic burdens of countless kalpas. Sorrows and entanglements follow endlessly—beyond the correction of parents, the transformation of sages, or the restraint of royal law; incurable by medicine, unsavable by any remedy.\n\nYet the upholder of this scripture does not resort to the strange or the coercive. With wondrous application, fitting and apt, the good Dharma is neither harsh nor grating, neither contrary to one’s heart nor burdensome to the body. It does not force what is difficult nor indulge through deception.

Demonic afflictions and karmic debts never again encroach; nine generations of ancestors and six relations—whether from past kalpas or yet to come—find peace in self and others, and the imprisoned in the unseen realms are freed from bondage. Wealth abounds and the body grows light. Not only does it raise those sunk in chronic illness, but it also transforms and dispels what has not yet taken form. Truly, without medicine there is joy, and life is preserved to extend one’s years—yet this is no mere single remedy or technique to bring ease to one body. The Celestial Physician is most excellent, the compassionate father of all beings, the wondrous Dharma that brings peace and joy.\n\nThis scripture is the great Dao of transcendence, the marvelous formula for refining the world. It is inherent in all, yet people, lost in delusion, fail to awaken. Those who uphold this true scripture with attainment should aid the world. Why, in this latter age, do selfish thoughts arise? Having gained but a little, they show no compassion to others. Like the people of Qin and Yue, each indifferent to the other’s plight, they neither teach the world at first nor find joy in the end. Their brief enlightenment is soon obscured, and they cannot achieve the Dao—how lamentable!\n\nAlas, to know the scripture yet not deliver the world is wrong. Yet to feign knowledge, delight in being a teacher, and recklessly transmit and initiate others is an even greater error. Only by eliminating these two faults and striving to fully understand this scripture can one universally deliver beings.\n\n**Chapter on Verification, Continued (28)**\nThe upholder of this scripture is called the Luminous Body, for they are constantly embraced by the Imperial Light.\n\nThe upholder of this scripture is not merely a good physician of the body but is named the Luminous Body. Human nature is inherently empty and luminous, illuminating all without obstruction. Yet when qi is constrained by things and obscured by delusion, its brightness is dimmed. The true upholder of this scripture, with nature and heaven radiant, opens the ground of the heart. Light shines constantly, the root of life fuses with essence, like the cloudless vastness of the great void, like the sun and moon alternating in brilliance. Vast and boundless, it flows abundantly.\n\nTruly, the Luminous Body is no defiled or darkened one. They are constantly embraced by the Imperial Light. The *Emperor* is the Jade Emperor. The Imperial Light shines universally, reaching all without exception. Yet people, being base and defiled, find it difficult to receive. Now, the upholder of this scripture treads the light of heaven, their cinnabar radiance illuminating the golden courts. When the cosmos is at peace, the light of heaven emerges. The August Emperor’s presence is manifest, its brilliance suffusing the mysterious void. The upholder of the scripture, looking up, receives it; great harmony and luminous clarity prevail. Embraced by the Imperial Light, the upholder is protected. Having received its transformation, they forever preserve constant purity. Light intermingles and reflects upon the upholder of the scripture.\n\nTheir faith aligns with heaven’s virtue, their brightness merges with that of the sun and moon. It is ever heard that the Dao of heaven descends to aid and illumine, inherently impartial. People receive heaven’s bright mandate, inherently great and luminous. Yet their nature is originally unstained, and the heart treasures emptiness and clarity. People, indulging in desires and pleasures, cannot keep the spirit-terrace free of things, like the sun and moon eclipsed, like clouds and mist obscuring the sky. If one does not adorn their faults, cut off desires, and return to principle, the momentary darkness will swiftly clear. Four directions open, eight reaches connect, and the bright grow brighter. Is there a time when the light of heaven does not shine, when the Imperial Light does not descend? Never has such a thing occurred.\n\nYet people bring ruin upon themselves, abandoning their true nature. Their thoughts swarm ceaselessly, active by day and resting by night, their minds never still for even a moment. What they do is already deluded, and their thoughts are further unclear, opposing heaven. Thus, they obscure the true scripture. A fleeting moment of awareness gives rise to karma. The retribution for sins is severe, and the cycles of suffering are not light. If one cannot swiftly reform and express remorse through words, then heaven cannot be deceived, nor spirits be fooled. People see themselves as if their lungs and liver were exposed—where is this nature that endures such self-deception?\n\nThus, the mandate of heaven’s protection and the Imperial Light’s auspicious embrace must belong to those who truly uphold the scripture, cultivate the Dao, and achieve transcendence. The true upholder of the scripture is named the Luminous Body, embraced by the Imperial Light.\n\nAlas, all people are one, and their bright virtue is the same. Why do they not uphold the scripture and fulfill the Dao, thereby meeting the heart of the August Emperor?\n\n**Chapter on Verification, Continued (29)**\nThe upholder of this scripture is called the Self-So Body, for their spirit can roam the wondrous realms of the celestial palaces.\n\nThe merits of upholding this scripture cannot be fully described. The upholder of this scripture is not only named the Luminous Body but also the Self-So Body. The three disasters, four killings, five phases, six harms, seven injuries, eight difficulties, nine stellar calamities, and ten evil karmas—all entanglements are severed, and the roots of karma are forever extinguished. They realize the Three Origins, empty the Five Aggregates, depart from the Four Marks, cut off the hundred wrongs, eliminate the ten thousand existences, transcend kalpas, and attain true liberation as the great Self-So Body.\n\nTheir spirit can roam the wondrous realms of the celestial palaces. The upholder of this scripture, with mysterious powers at will, attains self-mastery of the body. In all celestial palaces and every wondrous realm—whether the azure paths and jade steps, the coiling dragon walls and painted screens, the jade capital and golden towers, the purple courts and yellow chambers, the jasper towers and jade halls, the Jasper Gardens and Jasper Pools, the Mysterious Capital’s upper realms, the secret chambers and cinnabar terraces, the treasure groves and fragrant paths, the vermilion palaces of the spirit chambers, the Dharma bridges and brocade railings, the bright halls and ochre courts—or the jade grasses and gem flowers, ice peaches and snow plums, intersecting pears and flame dates, cinnabar feasts and jasper nectars, the radiance of the Dao and mysterious auspices, the rosy clouds and propitious vapors, the divine chariots and Dharma carriages, the Dharma treasures and celestial beings, the various marvelous flowers, and the contemplative journeys of the spirit—all surpass what ordinary people can attain.\n\nThe merits of upholding this scripture cannot be fully described; this merely hints at their vastness. The various merits of upholding this scripture benefit all beings—whether manifest or hidden, living or dead, past or present. Demons are subdued, the Imperial Light descends, and the spirit roams the celestial realms. Even so, these words do not exhaust its merits, for they are truly boundless.",

      "translated_text": "How then does the recitation of scripture by the sagely compare? Alas, the power of scripture is supreme. One must hold it with utmost sincerity and perpetuity.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Verifications Continued**\nMoreover, when Daoist practitioners or aspirants establish an altar to recite the scripture, donning fresh and pure garments, at the stillness after midnight—when the true forms of the *kun-kun* characters are concealed in darkness and silence—they should seclude themselves in a pristine chamber, strike their teeth nine times, face east in upright posture, and chant this scripture. At that moment, the Celestial Perfected attend their seats, the Jade Consorts sweep the ritual mats, the myriad spirits array in ranks, the hosts of heavens descend to the altar, the Three Realms stand guard, and the Five Emperors preside over the reception. Those who uphold this scripture become embodiments of twelve virtues, their compassion and salvation boundless.\n\nFurthermore, regarding \"Daoist practitioners or aspirants\": *Daoists* is the general term for those who cultivate the Dao and enter the mysterious. *Aspirants* refers to those of resolve—not to be mistaken for *Perfected Beings*, for only those who attain the Dao and achieve transcendence may be called *Perfected*. Some, upon reading passages about the Celestial Perfected, Jade Consorts, myriad spirits, hosts of heavens, Three Realms, and Five Emperors attending and receiving, assume the text refers to *Perfected Beings*. Yet they fail to recognize that this scripture is an imperial decree, and wherever it resides, the gods provide protection. Even if the reciter is a commoner, an elderly person, or a child, the gods revere them as they would the Emperor. Sincerity in upholding the scripture yields boundless blessings, while negligence invites immediate misfortune. The gods attend and receive out of respect for the true scripture, not necessarily for *Perfected Beings*. Moreover, establishing an altar, donning fresh garments, reciting at midnight in a quiet chamber, striking the teeth nine times, and sitting facing east are standard practices for students reciting scripture—not criteria for *Perfected Beings*. Thus, it is clear the text refers to *aspirants*.\n\nWhen such aspirants, in accordance with the ritual, purify themselves and recite the scripture, at that very moment: the Celestial Perfected attend their seats, the Perfected of all heavens descend to the sacred table. The Jade Consorts sweep the ritual mats—*sweeping* here denotes reverent cleansing, not repulsion, signifying solemn respect. The *mats* are the ritual seats. The myriad spirits array in ranks: just as earthly emperors command their ministers to assemble, this scripture, being the secret words of the Jade Emperor and the decrees of the Primordial Beginning, elevates the reciter to the status of one proclaiming an imperial edict, prompting all spirits to array in attendance. The hosts of heavens descend to the altar: all the Perfected Emperors of the heavens arrive at the sacred table. The Three Realms stand guard: the Three Realms—Heaven, Earth, and the Water Realms—with their divine generals and officials, array to protect. Some say the Three Realms refer to Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, but in the stillness of midnight within a secluded chamber, no humans are present; thus, it undoubtedly refers to the Three Realms of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Others suggest the Three Realms of Desire, Form, and Formlessness, but this is incorrect. The Five Emperors preside over the reception: the Five Emperors are the Five Elders of the Five Directions, the Five Numinous Lords. Some say they are the August Emperors of the Five Peaks. Given the prior mention of the myriad spirits and Three Realms, which include the Five Elders, here it should refer to the myriad spirits of the Five Peaks. Within the Three Realms, the Five Peaks are present, so the Five Elders are appropriate. The scripture contains the Five Elders’ inquiries, and thus, at its opening, the Five Elders preside over the reception of the Dao’s Ancestor. *Preside* means to govern or receive; *receive* means to welcome, embodying the reverence of the Empty Sovereign. Some say *preside over the reception* refers to the spirits of the scripture’s upholder ascending to the mysterious, which is also plausible.\n\nObserving the devotion of scripture recitation, the gods provide full protection; without sincerity, the gods will surely respond in kind. Those who encounter this scripture should hold it with solemn reverence, while those who have not should earnestly seek the opportunity. Be as solemn as if the gods were present, yet do not seek visible effects. Without thought or action, silently uphold the true scripture, and the spirits within your body will forever preserve the mysterious and true. Strive on without negligence.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Verifications Continued**\nMoreover, if one can close their eyes in tranquil contemplation, visualizing the scripture, they will unknowingly find themselves amidst clouds of three colors. Suddenly, their body radiates brilliant light, ascending to the celestial palaces, where the Perfected descend to welcome them. Whatever they request is granted, and elixirs, wondrous treasures, and all desires are attained at will. One should follow the rituals and practice with a devoted heart.\n\nNot only does sincere recitation of the scripture earn the protection of the gods, but one can also close their eyes in tranquil contemplation to reflect on the harms of the Five Aggregates—with form being the foremost. The eyes are the root of form’s disturbance to the mind. Upholding the true scripture requires bodily and mental purity; closing the eyes in stillness naturally stabilizes the mind. Yet the Dao’s profundities cannot be entered without contemplation, while reckless thoughts disrupt the true. Closing the eyes in silent sitting, free from desires, prevents the mind’s chaos, allowing quiet reflection to penetrate the subtle mechanisms—this is the essence of scripture recitation.\n\nNow, regarding \"silent sitting\": some advise half-closing the eyes, not fully shutting them, to avoid descending into a \"ghostly den\"—a state where one is unaware of stray thoughts from the dark realms. If the mind is pure, what harm is there in closing the eyes? Yet, as people’s resolve is often weak, closing the eyes may breed doubt or invite drowsiness, hence the advice to keep them half-open to avoid the demon of sleep. If one can forget both good and evil, even the absence of absence, the true Dao will naturally enter—what harm is there in closing the eyes? The \"half-closed\" teaching is a precaution by the mysterious masters against the demonic delusions of the uncommitted.\n\nMoreover, the meaning of \"half-closing the eyes\" is to refrain from external observation while maintaining inner illumination. The mind remains alert, its light undimmed, akin to the \"drooping curtain\" of governance: though not directly observing, one remains fully aware of all matters. This is the subtle mechanism of Dao cultivation, hence its mention alongside the discussion of scripture.",

The various merits of upholding this scripture benefit all beings—whether manifest or hidden, living or dead, past or present. Demons are subdued, the Imperial Light descends, and the spirit roams the celestial realms. Even so, these words do not exhaust its merits, for they are truly boundless.",

      "translated_text": "To contemplate this scripture is not to summon or grasp its imagery and efficacies, nor to visualize its dharmas as though beholding the Jade Emperor—though one should revere the Dao and ponder the True, never daring to treat it lightly. Merely reciting the scripture with the mouth while silently preserving this mind, delving deeply and exploring its profound principles, embodies the scripture within body and heart. This is what is meant by \"contemplating the scripture,\" until unawares, one finds oneself enveloped in clouds of three colors. These clouds arise from the qi of Heaven and Earth. When the contemplation of the scripture reaches great samadhi, uniting with the heart of Heaven, each thought pure and virtuous, auspicious clouds are born, and one becomes unknowingly surrounded by clouds of blue, yellow, and white. With the heart and body serene and upright, the Dragon and Tiger coil and spiral, hence the appearance of these three-colored clouds. If one’s cultivation of the True reaches completion, five-colored clouds will gather, and ninefold radiance will suffuse—this is yet another level. Suddenly, one sees their body radiant with brilliance, ascending to the Heavenly Palace, where hosts of perfected beings descend to welcome them. *E* signifies a brief moment. Suddenly, one’s bodily light blazes forth, resplendent and glorious. (The remainder of this explanation appears earlier.) If the heart harbors a request, ascending to the Heavenly Palace with a petition, all wondrous treasures and divine elixirs will be offered as desired. All the sublime treasures of the Primordial Jade Emperor will be presented at will, naturally obtained. One should not speak of seeking treasures but of receiving them for oneself. It is fitting to follow the prescribed teachings. With a profound and devoted mind, proceed as explained before. The scripture is the true essence of human nature; silent realization and perpetual adherence suffice. Yet, in terms of contemplation, this may seem a secondary meaning. The Confucian texts say: \"The indistinct and unseen are depicted, the formless is vividly beheld.\" They also say: \"Vast and boundless, as though above one.\" Is this, too, a secondary meaning? Alas, those of superior wisdom are few, while the mediocre are many. Without the practice of contemplation, how can one seek the unheard and unseen, fully unite with Heaven, and transcend the ordinary to enter sagehood? Let the scholar reflect on this.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two of the Verification Section Continued**\nThis scripture is such that all Golden Immortals of the Three Times and Great Sages of the Ten Directions have, by following its teachings in cultivation and devotion, transcended to realize the supreme and wondrous Dao. Here, the Jade Emperor is the Teacher of all Heavens and the King of all Sages. This scripture is not only for those who uphold and recite it but must be followed according to its teachings—even the Golden Immortals of the Three Times (past, present, and future). *Golden Immortals* refers to those whose golden elixir is indestructible, the True Immortals of the Great Mystery. The Great Sages of the Ten Directions—the four cardinal, four intermediate, upper, and lower directions—all the revered deities of the Lingbao tradition, the peerless and boundless Great Sages, have cultivated and devoted themselves to this scripture according to its teachings, as explained before. Thus, they transcend to realize the supreme and wondrous Dao. Differences in cultivation lead to varying degrees of attainment. Until one reaches the stage of Dao verification, it is not the supreme. Beings such as spirit immortals, human immortals, earth immortals, ghost immortals, as well as gods of the Desire, Form, and Formless Realms, bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, arhats, and buddhas, along with Confucian exemplars like transformed sages, great sages, virtuous ones, faithful scholars, and worthies—none of these are the ultimate. Only Heavenly Immortals, the Buddha of Scriptures, and the unknowable Sages surpass them; among gods and Confucians, these are the highest. The Golden Immortals and Great Sages, by single-mindedly following this scripture’s teachings, unite with the True Emperor and thus attain the highest immortality, transcending to realize the supreme, true, and wondrous Dao, free from the karmic fruits of the Heavens’ blessings. Here, the Jade Emperor is the Teacher of all Heavens—the thirty-three heavens, thirty-six heavens, twelve thousand heavens, and the three thousand great worlds—all who realize the great Dao through the *August Scripture*. The Jade Emperor is the Teacher of all Heavens, the transformer who perfects the hosts of perfected beings. He is the King of all Sages, for all immortals, Confucian sages, buddhas, gods of the heavens, and all holy beings yield to his virtue, defer to his merits, and acknowledge his supremacy, revering him through endless kalpas. Alas, when the Heavenly Lord within a person is at peace, the Dao may be attained. If one does not cultivate the heart to awaken and unite virtue with Heaven, vainly revering the Supreme Emperor, it is a grievous error. Beware and reflect on this.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three of the Verification Section Continued**\nTherefore, when an ordinary person encounters this scripture and cultivates it with single-minded devotion, they may even command the Five Emperors as their assistants, summon and employ the hosts of immortals, direct and govern the spirit officials, and guide the workings of yin and yang. A thousand spirits will revere them, ten thousand gods will submit in awe, all evil will avoid their path, and the myriad demons will constrain their forms. After the end of their life, they will immediately undergo refinement in the Southern Palace, ascend to the Upper Clarity, and roam freely and at ease, abiding with the Dao forever. It is not only the Golden Immortals and great worthies who realize the Dao through this scripture. Therefore, when an ordinary person encounters this scripture—an ordinary being of the world who, by karmic conditions, meets this scripture and cultivates it with single-minded devotion—even the Five Emperors (the Five Elder Sovereigns, not the Five Sacred Peaks) will assist their progress and support their shortcomings. They may summon and employ the hosts of immortals, directing and commanding the spirit officials. *Summon and employ* means to issue commands, and the immortals will obey; *direct and command* means to control and dispatch, and the spirit officials will serve. As the scripture says: \"Those who cultivate the Dao may command ghosts and drive away spirits.\" Though an ordinary person, through single-minded devotion to the scripture, the power of the Dao subdues them, enabling them to summon immortals and command spirits, guiding the workings of yin and yang. Only with utmost sincerity and singular focus, faithfully upholding this scripture, can one naturally govern creation, harmonizing yin and yang. A thousand spirits will revere them, a thousand spirits will honor and look up to them. Ten thousand gods will submit in awe—*submit* meaning to be struck with reverent fear and obedience; *awe* meaning to restrain their spirits and submit silently. The ten thousand gods submit without need for coercion. All evil will avoid their path, and the myriad demons will constrain their forms, daring not to appear.",

All the heavens—every realm’s celestial beings—naturally revere and honor this scripture. Its remaining virtues are beyond enumeration; as previously described, the merits of this scripture dissolve calamities and their transformations, eradicate disasters and their poisons, transform all without exception, and benefit all without limit. It is the great expedient, the supreme dharma among all teachings. Though uttered in the subtle words of the utmost sagely, it is the very function of one’s inherent nature.

They bowed their heads in reverence and offered this hymn of praise:\n\nGreat is the supreme Dao,\nPeerless, the Most High Perfected.\nAbove, it delivers the heavens;\nBelow, it rescues the lost souls.\nWithout master or ancestor,\nThe Dao alone is its body.\nCinnabar Terrace and Purple Palace,\nGolden Gates and Jade Capital—\nHere is concealed this wondrous dharma,\nBestowing blessings upon all beings,\nErasing my ten thousand sins,\nProlonging my distant years.\nMyriad spirits pay homage,\nDemon kings guard and welcome.\nVirtues flourish and prosper,\nMy name inscribed in the Yellow Register.\nThrough boundless eons,\nMay I endure forever.\n\nWhen the assembly had finished reciting this hymn, they bowed their heads in homage, took their leave, and departed.\n\nAt that time, the assembly in the Dao altar—the place where the Dao is expounded—Golden Immortals, Bodhisattvas, and the retinue of Perfected Sages, having heard the scripture’s conclusion, rejoiced with exultation, their joy overflowing. They bowed their heads in reverence and offered this hymn:\n\nGreat is the supreme Dao,\nVast beyond measure,\nUtmost and unattainable.\nPeerless, the Most High Perfected,\nWithout origin or beginning,\nThe highest and most true.\nAbove, it delivers the heavens,\nIts transformation pervading the heights.\nBelow, it rescues the lost souls,\nIts transformation penetrating the nether darkness,\nAll lingering spirits ascending.\nWithout master or ancestor,\nNo teacher, no progenitor.\nThe Dao alone is its body—\nIn praising this scripture,\nThe Dao is its essence.\nCinnabar Terrace and Purple Palace,\nRealm of the Great Mystery’s wonders.\nGolden Gates and Jade Capital—\nAs previously described.\nHere is concealed this wondrous dharma,\nSecret and treasured.\nBestowing blessings upon all beings,\nOr universally delivering all.\nErasing my ten thousand sins,\nThis scripture extinguishes all transgressions.\nProlonging my distant years,\nThis scripture extends life.\nMyriad spirits pay homage,\nRevering this scripture.\nDemon kings guard and welcome\nThose who uphold it.\nVirtues flourish and prosper,\nVast and all-pervading, enduring and boundless.\nMy name inscribed in the Yellow Register,\nRecorded in the immortal ledgers of the Mystic Capital,\nOn golden tablets and yellow registers.\nThrough boundless eons,\nVast and limitless, countless kalpas.\nMay those who uphold this scripture endure forever.\n\nWhen the assembly of Perfected Ones had finished reciting this hymn, they bowed their heads in homage, took refuge in *The Supreme Jade Emperor’s Original Acts Sutra*, and departed from the presence of the Most High Sage.\n\n**Thus concludes the lower scroll of *The Supreme Jade Emperor’s Original Acts Sutra*.**",
