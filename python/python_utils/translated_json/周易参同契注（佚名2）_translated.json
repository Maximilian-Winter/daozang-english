(Hereafter referred to as the *Promulgations* edition.)\n\n---\n\n### *Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Fascicle One\n\n**Anonymous Commentary**\n\nQian and Kun are the gates of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams. Kan and Li form the frame, turning the hub and aligning the spokes.\n\nThe *Xici* states: \"Are Qian and Kun not the gates of the *Yi*?\"\nFor Qian embodies pure yang, and Kun embodies pure yin.\nAll yang lines in the hexagrams derive from Qian’s yang;\nall yin lines derive from Kun’s yin.\nThus, the yin and yang of Qian and Kun serve as the gateway to all hexagrams.\n\nIn the human body, Qian corresponds to the head, encompassing the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and tongue—all that is manifest externally.\nKun corresponds to the abdomen, encompassing the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—all that resides internally.\nThus, all things belonging to yang are the work of Qian;\nthose belonging to yin are the work of Kun.\n\nIn the beginning, there were no hexagrams.\nYet Kan was conceived within Kun, and Li was conceived within Qian.\nIn the human body, the kidneys belong to Kan and reside below;\nthe heart belongs to Li and resides above.\nWhen Kan and Li unite, Kan circulates its yang, and Li circulates its yin, giving rise to the sixty-four hexagrams.\nWhen the Kan-man and Li-woman in humans unite in intercourse, the essence of all things is thereby established.\nThus it is said: \"Turning the hub and aligning the spokes.\"\n\n**Chapter One (concluded)**\n\nThe Four Gendered Hexagrams serve as the bolt and key.\nThey encompass the Dao of yin and yang, just as a charioteer wields the marking line, holds the bit and reins, aligns the compass and square, follows the wheel tracks, and governs the exterior from the center.\nTheir reckoning lies in the pitch-pipes and calendar, where the lunar phases comprise five and six.\nThirty days in all.\nThe warp and weft attend the sun’s command, combining to make sixty, with firm and yielding as outer and inner.\nThe Four Hexagrams are Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li.\nThe gendered pairings are the Dao of yin and yang.\nIn their greatness, they exhaust the yin and yang of all hexagrams, all of which are encompassed by these four.\nIn their function, they set in motion the yin and yang of all hexagrams, all of which are activated by these four.\nThus, governing the exterior from the center is like the two holding the marking line within, so that the compass and square are naturally aligned without;\nor the charioteer grasping the bit and reins within, so that the wheel tracks naturally follow without.\nIn their numerical aspect, Qian’s nine, Kun’s six, Kan’s seven, and Li’s eight truly form the guiding principles of the pitch-pipes and calendar.\nRegarding a single month, two celestial stems span five days, and six stems span fifteen days—hence a month contains the numbers five and six.\nWhen two hexagrams are used per day, firm and yielding alternate as warp and weft, outer and inner, fully realized in this manner.\n\n**Chapter Two (concluded)**\n\nAt dawn of the new moon, *Zhun* presides over affairs; by dusk, *Meng* takes its turn.\nDay and night each govern one hexagram, employed in due sequence.\nAfter the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams, the *Yi* follows with *Zhun* and *Meng*.\nNow, if *Zhun* rules at dawn and *Meng* at dusk, it is clear that two hexagrams are used each day.\nIf one further extends this sequence after *Zhun* and *Meng*, then day and night each govern one hexagram, and a month completes the cycle of sixty hexagrams.\n\n**Chapter Three (concluded)**\n\nFrom *Ji Ji* to the dark of the moon and the break of dawn...\n\n**Chapter Four**\n\nWhen an end is reached, it begins anew.\nThe celestial stems and earthly branches mark the cycles; movement and stillness have their early and late phases.\nThe *Yi* hexagrams conclude with *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji*. Beginning from the first day with *Zhun* and *Meng* and proceeding to the dawn and dusk of the dark moon, it is clear that the cycle ends with *Ji* and *Wei*. Yet when an end is reached, it must have a beginning, so the next month’s first day again commences with *Zhun* and *Meng*.\nNot only do the daily hexagrams follow their sequence, but *Zhun* and *Meng* also operate at the *zi* hour. Five days span two celestial stems, so the first quarter occurs at the *mao* hour, the last quarter at the *you* hour, while on the fifteenth and sixteenth days, the hexagrams operate at the *wu* hour. Their movements thus have early and late phases, which must not be overlooked.\n\n**Chapter Five**\n\nIn spring and summer, the inner body is engaged, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*.\nIn autumn and winter, the outer is employed, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*.\nYang qi arises at *zi* and ascends, hence spring and summer are termed the inner body. Yin qi descends from *wu*, hence autumn and winter are termed the outer use. This speaks of the twelve months’ fire phases.\n\n**Chapter Six**\n\nRewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat.\nThe line texts embody benevolence and righteousness, manifesting joy and anger in due season. Thus aligned with the four seasons, the Five Phases attain their principle.\nIn the *Yi*, the Way of Heaven has yin and yang, the Way of Earth has firm and yielding, and the Way of Man has benevolence and righteousness. When yang reaches spring, it brings forth life; when yin reaches autumn, it brings sternness. Man emulates yang’s life-giving by bestowing benevolence as reward, and yin’s sternness by enacting righteousness as punishment—his joy and anger thus manifest externally.\nFor the adept in cultivation, embodying spring’s life-giving occurs when yang qi is at its peak, at the first quarter of the month, when the golden essence takes flight. For spring belongs to Wood, and the golden essence to the Water of *Kan*. Water engenders Wood, embodying the principle of benevolence. Embodying autumn’s sternness occurs when yin qi is at its height, at the last quarter of the month, when the medicine is gathered. For autumn belongs to Metal, and the medicine of the *Li* palace belongs to Fire. Fire restrains Metal, embodying the principle of punishing rebellion. Thus aligned with the four seasons, how could the Five Phases not attain their principle?\n\n**Chapter Seven**\n\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them.\nHeaven and Earth are the images of *Qian* and *Kun*. \"Establish their positions\" means arranging the positions of yin and yang in correspondence. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*.\n*Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. These two functions have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids, their comings and goings unfixed, their ascent and descent without constancy. Hidden and submerged, they transform within. They enfold the myriad things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao.\nThat *Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun* is because *Qian*, being pure yang, is wholly Heaven’s virtue and cannot act on its own. Thus the *Yi* states: \"Heaven’s virtue cannot be made primary.\" Its function lies in yin—only by guarding foolishness with wisdom and clarity does the dragon’s power become usable. Hence it is said: \"Seeing the dragon without a head is auspicious.\" \"Without a head\" means guarding foolishness.\n*Kun*, being pure yin, cannot employ itself, nor can two lowly things command each other. Thus the *Yi* states: \"Perseverance in correctness is beneficial.\" Its function lies in yang, for self-employment leads to delusion, while finding a master brings benefit. Hence it is said: \"Losing friends in the northeast ultimately brings celebration.\" The northeast is the direction of yang.\nThus the *Qian* hexagram speaks of \"using nine,\" and the *Kun* hexagram of \"using six,\" while the others do not mention \"use.\" When pure yang generates one yin, the central void of *Li* becomes *Qian*’s function. When pure yin generates one yang, the firm center of *Kan* becomes *Kun*’s function. Therefore, among the sixty hexagrams, all yang lines are set in motion by the yin within *Qian*, and all yin lines by the yang within *Kun*. This is why *Qian* and *Kun* are the parents of the hexagrams. They do not stand among the hexagrams themselves, while *Kan* and *Li* serve as their functions. Thus they too remain hidden and submerged, not manifesting through line positions.\nThe \"six voids\" refer to the initial state of all hexagrams, which begin with the pure body of *Kun*, their six central positions all empty. Only because the six positions are empty can *Kan* and *Li* transform within, circulating *Qian* and *Kun*’s yin and yang through the six voids, thereby completing the bodies of the sixty hexagrams. Precisely because they must circulate through the sixty hexagrams, yin and yang sometimes ascend or descend, come or go—hence they cannot be reduced to fixed patterns, nor do they have constant forms. Though *Kan* and *Li* do not act directly, they enfold the myriad things and serve as the guiding principles of the Dao.\nIn man, *Qian* is the father and *Kun* the mother. The father’s essence and the mother’s blood are also *Kan* and *Li* as the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. Yet neither father nor mother can act on their own: yang must rely on yin, and yin on yang. Only when *Kan* and *Li* interact and function together do the five viscera, six bowels, hundred bones, and nine orifices all arise therefrom.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\n\nTo govern the existent with the non-existent, the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness.\nThus in tracing waxing and waning, *Kan* and *Li* vanish.\nThe existent is the myriad things; the non-existent is the single yang qi. The existent is the po; the non-existent is the hun.\nHere, \"non-existent\" refers to *Kan* and *Li* generating the two things of yin and yang, thereby forming the sixty hexagrams. Hence it speaks of waxing and waning.\n\nWhat is called \"vanishing\" refers to *Kan* and *Li* no longer functioning.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\n\nWords are not carelessly crafted; theories do not arise in vain.\nDrawing evidence to demonstrate effects, measuring by the numinous and bright.\nExtending categories to structure hexagrams, tracing principles for verification.\n*Kan* is the lunar essence of *wu*; *Li* is the solar radiance of *ji*.\nSun and moon constitute the *Yi*, with firm and yielding in balance.\nEarth reigns over the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end.\nGreen, red, white, and black each reside in their quadrant,\nAll receiving their mandate from the central palace, the work of *wu* and *ji*.\nTo say earth flourishes in the four seasons: among the five phases, earth has no fixed position, just as *Kan* and *Li* serve as the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*, thereby circulating to form the sixty hexagrams.\nThus *Kan* governs *wu* and *Li* governs *ji*, both residing at the center.\nFrom the first to the eighth day at noon, fifteen hexagrams are employed to symbolize spring’s green;\nFrom the eighth day at noon to the full moon, fifteen hexagrams symbolize summer’s red;\nFrom the sixteenth to the twenty-third day at noon, fifteen hexagrams symbolize autumn’s white;\nFrom the twenty-third day at noon to the thirtieth day, fifteen hexagrams symbolize winter’s black.\nThus it is said: green, red, white, and black all receive their mandate from *wu* and *ji*.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\n\nThe *Yi* is imagery.\nNo suspended image is more luminous than the sun and moon.\nExhausting the numinous to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives.\nLike spokes converging at the hub, the wheel turns—\nEmerging and entering, alternately rolling and unfolding.\nThe *Yi* contains three hundred eighty-four lines; based on the lines, tokens are drawn—these tokens are the sixty-four hexagrams.\nFrom the dark moon to dawn, *Zhen* arrives to receive the token.\nAt this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence,\nSun and moon mutually sustain.\nThe male yang scatters its dark effusion;\nThe female yin transforms the yellow womb.\nChaos intermingles and conjoins,\nThe primal root establishes its foundation.\nNurturing the bud, fostering the calyx,\nCongealing spirit to form the body.\nAll things tread forth from this,\nNo movement of the gnat but proceeds therefrom.\nThe male yang refers to *Kan*.\n\"Scattering its dark effusion\" means first transforming into *Zhen*, then into *Dui*, until it becomes *Qian*.\n*Qian* is heaven; heaven’s color is dark, thus the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* states: \"The male yang is the azure-dark water.\"\nThe female yin refers to *Li*.\n\"Transforming the yellow womb\" means first transforming into *Xun*, then into *Gen*, until it becomes *Kun*.\n*Kun* is earth; earth’s color is yellow, thus the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* states: \"The female yin is the ochre-yellow metal.\"\n\n**Chapter Ten**\n\nThereupon, Confucius praised the primal chaos, the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* penetrating emptiness.\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\n\nIn ancient times, at the dawn of the Primordial August, *The Osprey* established the first beginning.\nThe rites of crowning and marriage intertwine their qi, and in the first year the sprout burgeons.\nOf old, the sages composed the *Book of Changes*, whose Upper Canon begins with *Qian* and *Kun*—the Way of father and mother.\nThus the *Appended Judgments* states: \"The Way of *Qian* completes the male; the Way of *Kun* completes the female.\"\nThe Lower Canon begins with *Feeling*, *Five*, and *Grief*—the Way of husband and wife.\nThus the *Sequence of Hexagrams* states: \"Only with male and female does there come husband and wife.\"\n\nViewed from the standpoint of heaven and earth, *Qian* abides above while *Kun* abides below—this is the unjoined *Stagnation*.\nSeen from the perspective of the individual body, the unjoined *Li*-female and *Kan*-male form the uncrossed *Fire and Water*—the *Unfinished*.\nIs this not the truth that solitary yang cannot engender, solitary yin cannot complete, and only the vast and empty can penetrate all?\n\nYet when heaven and earth unite as *Peace*, when water ascends and fire descends to become *Completion*, is this not the truth that heaven and earth unite to generate the myriad things, and male and female unite to harmonize their aspirations?\nThus the sages ordered the *Book of Songs*, placing *The Osprey* at its head, and the Way of husband and wife was thereby rectified.\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nThe sage is not born in vain; above, he observes the manifest celestial signs.\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nThe celestial signs advance and retreat, expanding and contracting in accord with the seasons. Thus the *Book of Changes* aligns with the heart of heaven. The *Changes* correspond to heaven and earth—none but the sage can fathom this.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nThe *Fu* hexagram establishes the first sprouts;\nThe eldest son inherits the father’s form, the mother founds the primal foundation.\nThe waxing and waning of *Kun* above respond to the pitch-pipes,\nAscending and descending according to the pivot of the Dipper.\nOn the third day, clarity emerges—*Zhen* receives the west at *geng*.\nOn the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*, the first quarter hangs level as a cord.\nOn the fifteenth, the *Qian* body is complete, fullness reaches *jia* in the east.\nThe toad’s slowness and the hare’s radiance—sun and moon share a dual brightness.\nThe toad’s slowness marks the hexagram’s rhythm; the hare spits forth its living light.\nWhen the seventh and eighth days’ course is done, the fifteenth’s count bends low in descent.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\nAt the sixteenth turn, *Xun* receives the mandate, *xin* appears at dawn’s leveling.\n*Gen* aligns with *bing* in the south—on the twenty-third, the last quarter.\nOn the thirtieth day, *Kun* at *yi* loses its companion in the northeast.\nWhen the measure is exhausted, succession passes on, and the embodied *Dragon* is reborn.\nThe place where sun and moon meet is called the *chen*—thus in a year they meet twelve times.\nYet their meeting intersects at the new moon, hence it is said: “Sun and moon unite as jade discs” at the new moon.\nOnly at the new moon’s union do the moon’s dark essence sometimes eclipse the sun.\nYet both sun and moon move in reverse through the heavens—\nthe sun travels one degree per day, while the moon advances slightly more than thirteen degrees daily.\nBy the third day, the moon’s light begins to appear, having already moved nearly forty degrees from the sun.\nThus as the sun sets in the west, the moon receives the sun’s spirit—\nlike pure *Kun* gaining a single yang—this is the *Zhen* hexagram.\nIt appears above the western *geng* position, hence *Zhen* governs *geng*.\nBy the eighth day, the moon has drawn farther from the sun, its yang spirit growing full—\nthis is the *Dui* hexagram. As the sun sets, the moon’s course reaches the southern *ding* position—\nthis is the first quarter, hence *Dui* governs *ding*.\nBy the fifteenth day, sun and moon face each other, and the yang essence is complete—\nthus the *Qian* hexagram. As the sun sets, the moon has risen above the eastern *jia* position, hence *Qian* governs *jia*.\nYet even as the moon’s spirit reaches fullness, by midnight at *ren-zi*, the yin essence has already begun—\nthis is the *Li* hexagram, hence *Li* governs *ren*.\nFrom the sixteenth day onward, the yin essence first appears—\nlike pure *Qian* gaining a single yin—this is the *Xun* hexagram.\nAt the moment the spirit first stirs, its governed direction can be determined by the sun’s setting.\nBut once the yin essence has arisen, its emergence grows ever later,\nand the moon’s position can no longer be fixed by the sun’s descent.\nThus its determination relies on the sun’s rising.\nFrom the sixteenth day onward, as the sun prepares to ascend, the moon first reaches the western *xin* position—\nhence *Xun* governs *xin*.\nBy the twenty-third day, the moon nears the sun again, its yang spirit half-diminished—\nthis is the *Gen* hexagram. As the sun rises, the moon’s course has just reached the southern *bing* position—\nhence *Gen* governs *bing*, the last quarter.\nThe ancients said: “Near one, far three” describes the quarters.\nAt the first quarter, the moon’s forward motion has not yet distanced it far from the sun—hence “near one.”\nAt the last quarter, the moon has drawn much farther and now trails behind the sun—hence “far three.”\nFrom the twenty-third to the month’s end, the yang essence is spent, returning to the *Kun* hexagram.\nAs the sun begins to rise, it reaches the eastern *yi* position—hence *Kun* governs *yi*.\nYet as the yin qi reaches its extreme, the yang essence is already conceived in the dark night at *zi* and *gui*—\nthis is the *Kan* hexagram, hence *Kan* governs *gui*.\nIn the following month, it again receives the sign of *Zhen* at *geng*, hence it is said: “The embodied *Dragon* is reborn.”\nFor *Zhen* is the Dragon.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\n*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end.\nThe numbers seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six likewise correspond.\nThe fifteen numbers of the four directions sum to thirty—\nthe yang qi seeks extinction and concealment.\nThe eight trigrams array the luminaries, their movements never losing the center.\n*Qian* governs *jia*, yet also governs *ren*.\n*Kun* governs *yi*, yet also governs *gui*.\nAccording to the *Horizontal Heavenly Stem Cycle*,\n*Kan* also governs *gui*, and *Li* also governs *ren*—why?\nFor the *Qian* hexagram is pure yang, and at yang’s extreme, a single yin arises—\nthus when *Qian* reaches its yang extreme, *Li* is already born.\nThe *Kun* hexagram is pure yin, and at yin’s extreme, a single yang arises—\nthus when *Kun* reaches its yin extreme, *Kan* is already born.\nHence it is said: “*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end.”\n“The yang qi seeks extinction and concealment” means that by the thirtieth day, it transforms into pure *Kun*, leaving no yang—\njust as by the thirtieth day, the moon has no light.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\nThe primal essence is subtle and hard to perceive—\none infers and verifies through signs and evidence.\nAt rest, observe its images; model its forms.\nErect standards as measures, divine auspices to determine fortune or misfortune.\nIssue decrees in accord with the seasons—\ndo not miss the moment when the lines move.\nAbove, examine the patterns of the *River Chart*;\nbelow, sequence the earth’s flowing forms.\nIn the center, investigate the human heart—\ncompare and consider the Three Powers.\nIn motion, follow the hexagram’s rhythm;\nat rest, rely on the *Image* texts.\n*Qian* and *Kun* put into practice—\nonly then are heaven and earth ordered.\nHow could one not be cautious?\nThe secrets of fire and timing are most refined—\nbeyond the reach of ordinary reckoning.\nOne must carefully investigate and align with them,\ncreating diagrams and images to approximate their forms.\nIs this not what is meant by “above, examine the patterns of the *River Chart*?”\n\nNext, erect markers upon the earth to divine the moment’s auspices—\nthis may serve as a model for human conduct.\nIs this not what is meant by “below, sequence the earth’s flowing forms?”\n\nFurther, only when one acts in accord with the seasons, neither exceeding nor falling short,\nis this not what is meant by “in the center, investigate the human heart?”\n\nThus, when the Three Powers are settled and the hexagram’s rhythm unerring,\none’s virtue aligns with heaven and earth, one’s brightness joins with sun and moon,\nand one’s fortune or misfortune accords with ghosts and spirits.\nHow could one not be cautious?\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\nThe first principle of governance is to grasp the subtle and profound,\nto unfold and distribute treasures.\nThe essential Dao holds the handle of the Dipper, its pointer aligning with the twelve celestial branches to unify the transforming net.\nWhen the lines stir within, fortune or misfortune arises without.\nThe five wefts interweave in sequence, responding to the seasons’ movements.\nWhen the four and seven fall into discord, the twenty-eight lodgings lose their proper bearing, rising and bowing in disarray.\n\nThe first principle of governance speaks of the initial stage of refining the Golden Elixir.\nOne must first grasp the subtle and profound essence, making the heart as clear as counting one and two.\nOnly then may one follow the Dipper’s pointer to gather the myriad treasures in due order.\nOnce the pivotal mechanism is set and one moves in accord with the lines’ images,\nfortune and misfortune will invariably respond.\nThe five wefts are the five phases and the four seasons,\nintertwining and each following its principle, thus able to respond to the times.\nThe four and seven refer to the twenty-eight lodgings arrayed across the four directions,\nforming the 360 degrees of the celestial circumference.\nIf their sequence is disrupted, whether ahead or behind, rising or bowing out of place,\ndiscord will arise—how could one not be wary?\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\nWenchang oversees the records; the Three Dukes are summoned to account.\nThe hundred officials and their bureaus each govern their respective domains.\nWenchang signifies the ruler’s issuance of governance.\nThe Three Dukes symbolize *kan* and *li*.\nThe hundred officials symbolize the sixty hexagrams.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\nThe sun unites the essence of the five phases;\nthe moon receives the discipline of the six pitch-standards.\nFive and six make thirty degrees—\nonce the cycle is complete, it begins anew.\nTracing origins to grasp endings, one discerns the threads of survival and decay.\nIf the ruler grows arrogant and excessive, overbearing and deviating from the Dao,\nor if ministers act with deceit and flattery, their conduct straying from the proper path,\nthe waxing and waning of the moon’s phases will fall into disorder, bringing misfortune and calamity.\nThose who uphold the law must admonish and reprove, exposing faults to admonish the ruler.\nWhen the ruler is arrogant and self-indulgent, nearing fullness,\nthis means that at the crucible’s edge, one fails to weigh the precise measures, disregarding the method.\nWhen ministers act with deceit, straying from the proper path,\nthis means the sequence of the sixty hexagrams is disrupted, harming the divine chamber and the immortal embryo.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\nThe Pole Star receives rectitude, at ease and entrusting matters below.\nThe Hall of Light disseminates governance, and the state suffers no harm to the Dao.\nWithin, one nurtures the self, abiding in tranquility and emptiness.\nTracing back to the hidden and manifest, the inner illumination shapes the body.\nSeal the mouth to fortify the numinous root.\nThe Three Lights sink into obscurity, warming and nourishing the child-pearl.\nThough unseen, it is near and easily sought.\nAs the Three Lights are drawn inward, they are said to sink into obscurity.\nThe Pole Star refers to the Dipper.\nThe human head mirrors heaven.\n“Rectitude” refers to the mud-pill of the Nine Palaces.\n“Receives rectitude” means transmuting the dragon and tiger of *kan* and *li* to present them here.\nOnly then may one be at ease, entrusting the work to the yin and yang registers below—\nthat is, refining with fire.\nOne *cun* before the mud-pill of the Nine Palaces lies the Hall of Light.\nFrom there, one enters the Three Fields within,\nso the state suffers no harm to the Dao, and long life may be preserved.\nYet one must also illuminate the inner elixir to nurture the self,\nabiding in the realm of tranquility and emptiness.\nThough the origin is hidden, the inner illumination shapes the body like a pearl born of water,\nand the banks do not wither—this speaks of the lead in the *kan* palace.\nAs for gathering the mercury of the *li* palace and, with the dragon and tiger, fortifying the numinous root,\nthis is the qi of the five flowers in the heart.\nWithout sealing the mouth, it cannot be gathered.\nThe mouth is the *dui* trigram.\nThis is the true qi of one’s own body, not external qi—hence it is said to be near.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\nThe Yellow Center gradually permeates the principle, its moisture reaching the skin.\nAt first rectified, it is ultimately cultivated—\nonce the stem is established, the branches may be sustained.\nThe One veils and conceals it, so the world does not know.\nThe One is water.\nThe Yellow Center is the spleen, which transforms the medicine of cinnabar and stone\nto nourish the four limbs and the five viscera, giving rise to branches and leaves—\nhence it is said that once the ultimate is cultivated, the branches may be sustained.\nThe One is water.\nIt means water must not be recklessly discharged, for it can nurture the self from within—\nyet the world does not comprehend this.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One**\nThe supreme virtue acts without striving, not seeking through scrutiny.\nThe lower virtue acts through effort, its function unceasing.\nWhen the upper is sealed, it is called \"being\";\nwhen the lower is sealed, it is called \"non-being.\"\nThe non-being serves the upper,\nwhere the numinous virtue resides.\nThese two apertures follow the method—\nthe qi of Metal also requires long endurance.\n\nThe supreme virtue and lower virtue refer to *Li* as the heart, which dwells above,\nwithin which the Jade Fluid may become the Reverted Elixir, benefiting humanity—hence it is called supreme virtue.\n*Kan* as the kidneys dwells below,\nwithin which the Golden Fluid may also become the Reverted Elixir, benefiting humanity—hence it is called lower virtue.\nTo gather the Jade Fluid, one need not rely on cultivation.\nTo gather the Golden Fluid, one cannot do without the furnace and bellows—\nwithout cultivation, it cannot be attained.\nWhen sealed and obstructed,\nthe Jade Fluid is closed and enters the Mysterious Throat (the Mysterious Female),\nthen rejoicing in its return.\nThe Golden Fluid is closed and enters the Tail Gate,\nthen rejoicing in its absence of leakage.\nThis is the distinction between \"being\" and \"non-being.\"\nThe Golden Fluid ascends from below to become the *po*;\nthe Jade Fluid descends from above to become the *hun*—\nhence it is said the numinous virtue resides.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\nKnow the white, guard the black—\nwhite is Metal’s essence, black is Water’s foundation.\nThe numinous brightness comes of itself.\nWater is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One.\nThe beginning of yin and yang,\nmysteriously containing the Yellow Sprout.\nThe master of the five metals,\nthe Northern River Chariot.\nThus lead appears black without,\nyet harbors golden splendor within—\nclad in coarse cloth, bearing jade,\noutwardly a madman.\n\nMysterious is the color of Heaven;\nYellow is the color of Earth.\nWithin pure *Qian*, yang reaches its extreme and generates yin,\nwhereupon *Li* arises.\nFrom *Li* emerges *Xun*, then *Gen*, extending to *Kun*—\nthis is what is meant by containing the Yellow Sprout.\nWhen a person receives the embryo,\nit originates from the father’s essence,\ntransforming to generate the five viscera—\nthus among the five viscera’s metals, the kidneys preside.\nPreserved in the kidneys, it becomes Metal.\nWhen the golden essence takes flight,\nthe River Chariot is employed to transport it—\nthe River Chariot is the qi ascending from the North to reach the Muddy Pellet.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**\nMetal is the mother of Water,\nthe mother conceals the child’s embryo.\nWater is the child of Metal,\nthe child dwells in the mother’s womb.\nThe Perfected One is most wondrous,\nseeming to exist, seeming not to exist.\nLike a great abyss with tangled kelp,\nnow sinking, now floating.\nWithdrawing, they disperse,\neach guarding its own domain.\n\nMetal can generate Water—hence it is called the mother of Metal.\nMetal resides within *Kan*—hence it is said to conceal the child’s embryo.\n*Kan* is the kidneys; though the kidneys are Metal’s child,\nthey first dwell within the mother’s womb before this body exists.\nYet when first concealed in the mother’s womb,\nif not for the Perfected One’s presence within,\nhow could it attain such wondrous subtlety?\nViewed from its subtlety, one takes it as being;\nyet as a mere clod of earth, one takes it as non-being—\nyet the myriad things are all contained within.\nLike sinking and floating in the great abyss,\nit cannot be fathomed by ordinary perception.\nWhen it withdraws and disperses,\nthe five viscera, six bowels, hundred bones, and nine orifices\nare all thereby completed.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five**\n\nIts essence resembles white; when refined, it becomes vermilion.\nTempered as external defense, white enfolds the steadfast core within.\nSquare and round, a mere inch in span—intermingled, they constrain one another.\nBorn before Heaven and Earth, majestic and exalted.\n\nThe human body’s upper part is Heaven; its lower part, Earth.\nBefore this body existed, it received the father’s essence,\nand only then could this Heaven and Earth come to be—thus essence and qi take precedence.\nThe *Book of Changes* takes *Qian* as the head and *Kun* as the belly—this is the same principle.\nSquare and round, a mere inch in span—this is the cinnabar field.\nMetal resides within *Kan*, and its color is white.\nYet if one does not obtain the vermilion of the southern quarter,\nhow could one complete the golden elixir?\nIt is like the father’s essence requiring the mother’s blood\nto fulfill the meaning of generation and transformation.\nThus white abides within as the steadfast core,\nwhile *Li* serves as external defense to refine it without—\nhence they constrain one another within a single inch.\nFor within pure yin, one yang revives to form *Kan*,\nthen transforms into *Zhen*, into *Dui*, and finally into *Qian*.\nWithin pure yang, one yin arises to form *Li*,\nthen transforms into *Xun*, into *Gen*, and finally into *Kun*.\nThus *Kan* and *Li* are born before Heaven and Earth,\nand so stand majestic and exalted.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\n\nSurrounding walls and watchtowers—shaped like Penglai’s isles.\nEncircling barriers, sealed gates, four passages winding and slow.\nGuard and defense are tight and firm, barring all wickedness.\nCurved galleries connect, ever vigilant against the unforeseen.\nOne may remain free of care, yet not succumb to weariness.\nThe chamber brims with spirit and qi—none can detain them.\nThose who preserve it thrive; those who lose it perish.\nIn movement and stillness, rest and activity, it ever accompanies the person.\n\nThe walls and watchtowers are the palaces of the kidney region.\nThe curved galleries are the Gate of the Tailbone.\nVigilance against the unforeseen means preventing leakage in dreams.\nOnly by maintaining no deviant thoughts in daily life can this be achieved.\nMovement leads to loss of stillness, while rest and activity preserve it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven**\n\nThese are the misguided methods of internal alchemy:\ninward gazing with deliberate thought,\ntreading the steps of the Dipper and lunar lodges,\nreckoning days and celestial stems.\nThe yin path suppresses nine and one, muddling and toying with the primordial womb.\nIngesting qi gurgles in the intestines and stomach;\nexhaling the upright, inhaling external perversities.\nDay and night, never sleeping outwardly;\nfrom new moon to dark moon, never ceasing.\nThe body grows weary and exhausted, the mind dazed as if deranged.\nThe hundred vessels seethe and race, unable to settle into clarity.\nPiling earth to erect altars, morning and evening offering reverent sacrifices.\nGhosts and spirits manifest forms, dreams and sleep stir emotions.\nThe heart rejoices, the mind delights—prolonging the appointed time.\nYet suddenly, life is cut short in death, exposed and rotting.\nEvery action goes awry, perverse and contrary to the pivotal mechanism.\nSuch arts are myriad, with a thousand strands and ten thousand threads—\nall deviating from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, twisting and turning against the Nine Capitals.\n\nThese are the sundry heterodox minor methods, by which later learners may know what to avoid.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\n\nThe discerning grasp its meaning, perceiving clearly its source.\n\nPersevering in its practice, rising early and retiring late without rest,\nAfter three years of ingesting the elixir, one ascends lightly and roams afar.\nStriding through fire yet unscorched, entering water yet undrenched.\nAble to appear, able to vanish—ever joyful, free from care.\nThe Dao perfected, virtue accomplished, one withdraws to await the moment.\nThe Great One then summons, and one’s name is transferred.\nWith merits fulfilled, one ascends on high, receiving the register and the chart.\nThe book of *Can* declares: those who apply their minds to fathom it\nwill find no elixir beyond the golden cinnabar.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\n\nThe *Fire Record* was not composed in vain; it expounds the *Yi* to clarify the process.\nThe crescent-moon method: the White Tiger serves as the pivot of refinement.\nMercury is the flowing pearl of the sun, the Green Dragon accompanying it.\nRaising the sheaf to meet the west, soul and spirit naturally bind.\nThe upper crescent, *dui*, holds the number eight; the lower crescent, *gen*, also eight.\nWhen the two crescents merge their essence, the body of *Qian* and *Kun* is formed.\nTwo eights make one *jin*; the Dao of the *Yi* stands upright, unwavering.\nA *zhu* contains three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, corresponding to the number of hexagrams and lines.\nThe upper crescent yields eight ounces of lead; the lower crescent, eight ounces of mercury.\nOne *liang* equals twenty-four *zhu*; together, sixteen *liang* total three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*,\nmatching the three hundred and eighty-four lines of the sixty-four hexagrams.\nThus it is said: the body of *Qian* and *Kun* is formed.\nThe White Tiger is the silver within *Kan*.\nWithout the crescent-moon furnace to refine it, this treasure can never be obtained.\nIt is called the pivot because, once this treasure is secured,\nit must be circulated along the winding path until it reaches the Muddy Pellet and halts.\nNext, *Li* becomes the sun, the flowing pearl emerging from the Jade Pool,\nwhile the Green Dragon travels the same path to arrive.\nIf one can guide the mercury-dragon through the Mysterious Female’s gate,\nthen dragon and tiger unite—hence \"raising the sheaf to meet the west.\"\nThe tiger is the *po*; the dragon, the *hun*—thus they bind within the crucible.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine**\n\nGold enters fierce fire, yet its color does not fade nor its luster dim.\nSince the dawn of creation, the sun and moon have never lost their brightness,\nnor has gold forfeited its weight, nor have the sun and moon altered their form.\nGold originally receives the solar tally at the new moon’s dawn.\nWhen gold returns to its mother, the moon at dusk envelops it,\nhiding its frame and sinking into the cavernous void.\nGold regains its original nature, and the cauldron’s radiance rejoices.\nGold is the fluid within *Kan*. Refined by the fire of *Li*, it grows ever firmer and more luminous.\nThe sun is *Li*; the moon, *Kan*.\nWithout the interplay of metal and fire, *Kan* and *Li* would lose their brilliance after use,\nyet gold never loses its weight, for it is ceaselessly regenerated.\nThe sun and moon retain their form because their source is utterly steadfast.\nYet only when metal and fire are employed for the golden elixir can this hold true.\nOtherwise, as the *Huangting Jing* says—\"leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdure;\nqi perishes, fluids leak, and the body is no more\"—such cases cannot be spoken of in the same breath.\nThe *Classic* states: \"Begin with rectitude, and the end will be well-ordered; establish the stem, and the branches may be grasped.\"\nThis is the meaning.\nIn general, gold is born from *Kan* and waxes and wanes with the sun’s spirit.\nThus, at the new moon, it receives the solar tally and grows ever more abundant.\nFrom the birth of the yin tally to the dark of the moon, the lunar *po* transforms into *Kun*.\nThus gold returns to its mother, for *Kun*’s earth is gold’s mother.\nYet when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born.\nAt the dark of the moon, the moon already enfolds the sun’s spirit,\nlike *Kan* gestating within *Kun*.\nThough its light is not yet visible externally, it lies concealed within its frame,\nsubmerged in the cavernous void.\nAt this moment, the golden elixir regains its original nature, and its brilliance blazes ever brighter.\n\n**Chapter Thirty**\n\nThe numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to make three; *wu* and *ji* are called five.\nWhen three and five harmonize, the eight minerals form the guiding principle.\nBreathing in desire, contemplation unites them as husband and wife.\nYellow earth is gold’s father; the flowing pearl, water’s mother.\nWater treats earth as its ghost; earth subdues water, preventing its rise.\nThe Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, balancing victory and defeat.\nWhen water prevails, fire is extinguished, and both perish, returning to the fertile earth.\nOnce the three natures converge, their original essence shares a common ancestor.\n*Kan* is water, the number one; *Li* is fire, the number two.\nTogether they make three.\n*Kan* governs *wu*; *Li* governs *ji*. *Wu* and *ji* belong to earth, the number five—hence \"three-five.\"\nThe two embody the relationship of husband and wife, thus they harmonize.\nThe eight minerals are the eight luminous jades of the *Huangting Jing*,\nreferring to the elixir ingredients gathered from the eighth to the fifteenth day.\nThe two are prized as husband and wife, their union sought through breath.\nExhaling when the sun rises, inhaling when the moon appears.\nYellow earth is the fluid of the spleen, thus it generates the metal of the lungs.\nThe flowing pearl is the sun’s flowing pearl, also the lung’s fluid, thus it generates *Kan*’s water.\nYet when the yin tally arrives, the yang qi vanishes and hides, the body’s *po* transforming into *Kun*.\n*Kun* belongs to earth, so water is subdued and grows faint, unable to stir.\nWithout the fire’s essence to harmonize it, how can its spirit be restored?\nOnly when water prevails and fire wanes does earth ultimately dominate, leaving no vitality.\nYet it is called \"water’s prevalence\" rather than \"yin’s prevalence,\"\nfor from the lower crescent to the thirtieth day, the season is winter, the direction north—hence \"water prevails.\"\n\nThe Three Essences Share a Common Origin—this refers to the moment when a person first receives the embryo. The father’s essence serves as the foundation, transforming to form the five viscera, and thus the Five Phases of the five viscera all take water as their origin.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\nSesame prolongs life—this is *huma*.\nThe returning elixir may be ingested.\nGold’s nature does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things.\nThose who consume it as alchemists gain long life.\nEarth wanders through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and setting rules.\nGolden sand enters the five viscera, dispersing like mist or wind and rain.\nBlack vapor reaches the four limbs, restoring radiance and luster to the complexion.\nWhite hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow in their original place.\nThe elderly regain youthful vigor, the aged crone becomes a maiden.\nTransforming form to escape worldly calamity, one is called a Perfected Person.\nThe gold within *Kan* is refined into the returning elixir, never decaying—thus it is the greatest treasure among all things.\n\"Earth wanders through the four seasons\" means that the two trigrams *Kan* and *Li* govern *wu* and *ji*, distributing the sixty-four hexagrams across thirty days, dividing them into four seasons.\nThus, one month seizes the qi of an entire year.\nBeyond the crucible and furnace, *Kan*-gold and *Li*-sand are used to nurture the inner elixir.\nWhen golden sand enters the five viscera, it disperses like clouds and mist, moistening like wind and rain.\nThus, it steams the four limbs, reversing age to restore youth—how could this not have its foundation here?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\nLead powder cast into fire loses its color and reverts to lead.\nIce and snow, warmed by hot water, dissolve into the Great Mystery.\nGold takes cinnabar as its essence, harmonizing with mercury.\nTransformation arises from its authenticity, beginning and end naturally following one another.\nTo become an immortal through ingestion, one must use substances of the same kind.\nPlant millet with millet, hatch chicks with eggs.\nSupporting nature with like kinds, things form easily as if molded.\nFish eyes are not pearls, thistles have no value.\nLike attracts like; discordant matters do not yield treasure.\nThus, swallows do not birth phoenixes, foxes and hares do not nurse horses.\nWater does not flow upward in flames, fire does not moisten downward.\nLead powder is made from lead—cast into fire, it reverts to lead.\nIce and snow, formed from water, melt in warm water to become water again.\nSo too the golden elixir relies on cinnabar and mercury; when fire ceases, it returns to its original nature.\nThis reveals that things have their roots, and beginning and end cannot destroy themselves.\nHow could those who cultivate the elixir disregard *Kan* and *Li* and employ their minds elsewhere?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\nThe world abounds with scholars, gifted with lofty talent.\nYet chance meetings elude them, wasting fire and squandering wealth.\nThey rely on texts, imposing their own interpretations.\nThreads lack cause, measures lose control.\nThey smelt malachite and quartz, purchase mother-of-pearl and lodestone.\nThey burn sulfur with camphor wood, knead clay and refine it into flying ash.\nThey smelt the five metals with copper beneath the bellows, using them as auxiliary pivots.\nMixed natures of different kinds—how could they willingly unite?\nA thousand attempts lead to ten thousand failures; what they seek to transmute turns to dross.\nFortune never favors them, for only the sage truly understands.\nFrom youth to white-haired age, doubt arises midway.\nTurning from the Dao to cling to delusion, leaving the straight path for crooked byways.\nPeering through a tube, their vision is narrow—how can they gauge what lies ahead?\nIf wisdom is insufficient to illuminate this principle, do not rashly act on whim.\nTo act on whim invites the scorn of those who know.\n\nAs for the utmost sages, none surpass Fuxi, who first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling them upon Heaven and Earth. King Wen, imperial ancestor, structured the forms and composed the line statements. The Master, near-sage and hero, supplemented them with the *Ten Wings*. These three lords, Heaven’s chosen, arose in succession through the ages. Though their excellence followed in steps, their virtue and power did not differ in kind. Their creations built upon what came before, their calculations weighed each fraction with care. What has form is easily measured, but what leaves no trace is hard to contemplate. Their deeds set patterns for emulation, their works established the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* for the world. Lacking innate foreknowledge, they relied on teachers to awaken their understanding. Bright as one who parts the curtains, they opened their eyes and ascended the high terrace. The *Book of Changes* was thus completed by the hands of these three sages—how could it be easily understood? How much more so the subtle principles of the Golden Elixir, which embodies the *Changes* in its very essence? Its mysteries and hidden depths surpass even these.\n\n---\n\nThe *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters share a common aim. Though their words are earnestly expounded,世 people do not ponder them deeply. Tracing their origins, the obscure and the manifest originally dwell as one. I speak here for the wise—how dare I treat these writings lightly? Yet if I seal my lips in silence, I risk severing the Way and incurring punishment. To commit my thoughts to bamboo and silk might reveal Heaven’s tally. Hesitant, I sigh in uncertainty, gazing up and down in foolish attachment. The art of refinement has its methods, yet I hesitate to lay them all bare. I shall outline only their essential framework, that the branches may be seen through the guiding threads. These six hundred chapters correspond to a year’s ten months of firing—excluding the second and eighth months of rest—with each month employing sixty hexagrams, totaling six hundred. \"Obscure\" refers to the Way of Heaven and Earth; \"manifest\" refers to man.\n\n---\n\nWith metal as the embankment, water enters and flows freely.\n\nWith gold reckoned at fifteen and water’s measure the same,\nBefore the furnace, fix the weights—five parts water in excess.\nThese two become the true essence, gold’s weight as in its origin.\nThe third then does not enter; fire’s dual aspect joins with it.\nThree substances unite in reception,\nTransforming with a power divine.\nBeneath lies the qi of Great Yang,\nSteaming and seething in but a moment.\nFirst liquid, then congealing,\nIt is called the Yellow Ascent.\nAs years and months draw to their close,\nNature is undone and lifespan harmed.\nThe form becomes ash and dust,\nAppearing like dust on a bright window.\n\nThe fifteen refers to taking five from ten.\nFrom the first to the fifteenth day,\nOne gathers gold at the waxing half-moon—\nThus below it is said “five parts water.”\nWater is the numinous water of the Jade Pool, likewise measured.\nThe “third that does not enter” divides one day into four parts:\nBoth gold and water take one part,\nWhile the remaining twenty-three days do not.\n“Fire’s dual aspect” refers to the two *gen* trigrams of yin and yang, the fire of necessity.\nGold is the yang within *kan*,\nWater is the yin within *li*, the clear water of the Jade Pool.\n\n“As years and months draw to their close”:\nIn the twelfth month, the end lies in the *kun* hexagram’s close at the *hai* month.\nIn one month, it ends on the thirtieth day of *kun-yi*.\nIn one day, it ends at the *hai* hour.\nThe yang soul of fire perishes therein—thus it is called “nature undone.”\nEach day steals a minor year,\nEach month steals a middle year,\nTwelve months steal a great year,\nAll reaching their term by year’s end, harming one’s clarity.\nOnly when thus undone and harmed\nDoes the moon’s form resemble ash and dust,\nIts appearance no different from dust on a bright window.\n\nEntering through the Crimson Gate,\nSeal its junctures fast,\nEnsuring all is whole and firm.\nBeneath, the blazing fire spreads,\nIts roar ceaseless day and night.\nFirst, the civil method is applied;\nIn the end, the martial is arrayed.\nObserve with utmost care,\nDiscerning the shifts of cold and warmth.\nThrough the twelve cyclical nodes,\nAt each completion, attend anew.\nWhen qi is spent and life near its close,\nRest and death claim the hun and po souls.\nThe hue shifts, turning deep violet—\nResplendent, the Reverted Elixir forms.\nGround to powder, shaped into a single pellet,\nThe *daogui* is most divine.\nPrayers and treatments combine here,\nWhere all medicines converge.\n\nThe Crimson Gate refers to the crucible.\nSeal it whole and firm, allowing no leaks,\nThen kindle the fire to refine it.\nBegin with the civil, end with the martial,\nAttending to cold and warmth.\nWhen the fire’s measure completes one cycle,\nQi is exhausted, the flame spent,\nThe hun fades, the po returns—\nAnd the Elixir is achieved.\nWhat is this if not divine?\n\nExtending the reckoning of the Five Phases,\nConcise yet not cumbersome.\nWater is raised to quench fire,\nAnd suddenly light is extinguished.\nSun and moon press close,\nEver between dark and dawn.\nWhen water waxes, Kan encroaches on yang,\nWhen fire wanes, Li dims the day.\nYin and yang consume each other,\nTheir intercourse the natural Dao.\n\nThe moon itself holds no brightness,\nBut borrows light from the sun.\nOnly when the moon reaches its darkest\nDoes it transform into pure Kun’s body.\nYet within, Kan’s yang is already conceived,\nThus at the cusp of dark and dawn,\nThe moon may encroach on yang—\nHence the saying of raising water to quench fire.\nKan encroaching on yang, Li dimming the day—\nThis is the moon eclipsing the sun,\nAlso called the natural intercourse of yin and yang.\n\nAbove, Chapter Thirty-Nine.\n\nNames serve to fix essence,\nCharacters express the nature’s speech.\nWhen metal returns to its original nature,\nOnly then is it called the Reverted Elixir.\nI dare not speak falsely,\nBut emulate the sages’ texts.\nAncient records speak of Dragon and Tiger,\nThe Yellow Emperor praised Golden Flower.\nHuainan refined Autumn Stone,\nWang Yang added Yellow Sprout.\nThe worthy can uphold and practice,\nThe unworthy must not partake.\nThe Dao of past and present remains one,\nIts discourse reveals all plans.\nScholars, exert yourselves,\nReflect deeply and ponder.\nThe essential words are plain,\nClear and never deceiving.\n\nNames correspond to tangible reality,\nWhile characters emerge from the nameless.\nThe \"having\" is the *po*, its essence;\nThe \"non-having\" is the *hun*, its nature.\nOnly when the Elixir’s fire is extinguished\nCan nature be restored and the Elixir formed.\nThough the principles of the Golden Elixir\nRequire careful attention to grasp,\nIts meaning is self-evident, not concealed.\n\n*Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Volume One,

on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi**\n*Title: Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*\nOriginally attributed to an anonymous commentator.\nThree fascicles.\nBase text from: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity Tradition*, Great Mystery Section.\nCollated with: The *Siku Quanshu* edition from the Wenyuan Pavilion, containing Yu Mei’s *Zhouyi Cantong Qi Fahui* (hereafter *Fahui* edition).\n\n**Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi, Fascicle Two**\n*Anonymous Commentary*\n\nThe Qian’s firmness and Kun’s softness,\nMutually embracing in union.\nYang bestows, yin receives,\nMale and female each requiring the other.\nOnly when they #1 unite in creation\nDoes essence-qi begin to unfold.\nKan and Li crown the head,\nRadiance spreading and descending.\nThe profound and obscure are hard to fathom,\nImpossible to depict in diagrams.\nThe sage measures and weighs,\nAligning the primal foundations in sequence.\nThe four blend into chaos,\nDirectly #2 entering the void and nothingness.\nThe sixty hexagrams expand and spread as a chariot,\nDragon and horse harnessed to the yoke,\nThe enlightened ruler mastering the seasons.\nIn harmony, they follow,\nThe path level and without deviation.\nDeviant ways are perilous and treacherous,\nToppling and endangering the state.\nFrom the first to the fifteenth day,\nQian envelops Kun.\nFrom the sixteenth to the thirtieth day,\nKun envelops Qian.\n\nThe moon as a celestial body initially possesses only its substance, yet it becomes luminous only after receiving the light of the yang. The primal foundations are Kan and Li. The four refer to the addition of Qian and Kun. \"Entering the void\" means non-application. The chariot carries the sixty hexagrams as it moves. The ruler is the heart-mind.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nWhen the noble person dwells in their chamber and their words are virtuous, they elicit a response even from a thousand *li* away. This speaks of the lord of ten thousand chariots, abiding within the nine-fold chamber, issuing decrees and commands, aligning with the rhythms of yin and yang. Conceal the vessel and await the proper time; do not transgress the hexagrams and months. *Zhun* employs *zi* and *shen*; *Meng* uses *yin* and *xu*. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days. Issuing decrees and commands in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang refers to extracting the elixir and regulating the firing times.\n\nRegarding the sixty hexagrams, one day employs two hexagrams. Regarding the firing process, one day uses two periods—morning and evening. Thus, only *Zhun* and *Meng* are mentioned, as they are the first hexagrams following *Qian* and *Kun*, though their application naturally involves advance and retreat. Hence, the timing differs before and after. For instance, at midnight, the *zi* hour, when the first yang arises, one embodies the single yang and applies the fire. At the *chou* hour, when the second yang arises, one embodies the two yang and applies the fire. By the *si* hour, one employs the sixfold fire. One count corresponds to three qi manifesting as a single yang line. Two counts correspond to three cycles of two qi, manifesting as two yang lines. By six counts, three cycles of six counts manifest the full six yang. This is the way of eight transformations to complete a hexagram.\n\nWhen the inverted yin tally first arises at *wu*, one retreats by one count, applying the fivefold fire. Retreating to the *hai* hour, the six yin are complete, and no fire remains. The statement that *Zhun* employs *zi* and *shen* refers specifically to the *Zhun* hexagram, for it is composed of upper Kan and lower Zhen. The Zhen hexagram begins at *gengzi*, while the Kan hexagram next begins at *wushen*. The statement that *Meng* uses *yin* and *xu* likewise refers to the *Meng* hexagram, for it is composed of upper Gen and lower Kan. Kan begins at *wuyin*, while Gen next begins at *bingxu*. Thus, each hexagram has its own morning and evening.\n\nRegarding the hexagrams of the direct days, the sixty hexagrams are recorded within the twelve hours, their application each having its own sequence. Yet in a single day, fire is not applied beyond two hours, so *Zhun* and *Meng* are cited as the general case.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\nI have briefly set forth the two images, though I have not yet exhausted their details.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\nEstablishing principles#8 calls for enacting punishments; applying benevolence requires bestowing virtue. Those who defy them meet misfortune; those who follow them attain fortune#9. Consult the calendrical statutes, abide in utmost sincerity and meticulousness. Carefully observe the celestial stems and branches, scrutinizing the waxing and waning. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and harm. From the first to the fifteenth day, brightness is bestowed upon the moon, thus it is called \"applying benevolence.\" From the sixteenth to the thirtieth day, the lunar essence gradually obscures brightness, thus it is called \"enacting punishments.\"\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\nAt the two solstices, the measures change, diverging and twisting in complexity. Midwinter brings scorching heat; midsummer yields frost and snow#10. At the two equinoxes, the directions are askew, no longer aligning with the clepsydra’s marks. Wind and rain fall out of season; floods and droughts contend. Locusts surge like boiling water; strange grasses sprout wildly. Heaven displays its omens; mountains collapse and the earth splits#11. The filial son’s devotion moves the August Ultimate. Near at hand, it issues from his own mouth; afar, it flows into distant lands. Some thereby invite calamity; some thereby secure fortune. Some usher in great peace; some provoke warfare. These four outcomes arise from the heart’s intent.\n\nThe winter solstice corresponds to the *zi* hour; the summer solstice to the *wu* hour; the spring equinox to the *mao* hour; the autumn equinox to the *you* hour. At the winter solstice, when the first *yang* arises, apply the first-grade fire. When the six *yang* reach their peak, apply the sixth-grade fire. At the summer solstice, when the first *yin* arises, reduce the fire by one grade, applying only the fifth grade. When the six *yin* reach their peak, the fire grades are entirely extinguished.\n\nTaking the month of the winter solstice as an example: in one month, only the first-grade fire is applied, always during the *zi* hour. This holds for all twelve months. For instance, from the first to the early third day, apply the fire during the *zi* hour; from the evening of the third to the fifth day, apply it during the *chou* and *hai* hours; from the sixth to the early eighth day, apply it during the *yin* and *xu* hours; from the evening of the eighth to the tenth day, apply it during the *mao* and *you* hours; from the eleventh to the early thirteenth day, apply it during the *chen* and *shen* hours; from the evening of the thirteenth to the fifteenth day, apply it during the *si* and *wei* hours; from the sixteenth to the early eighteenth day, apply it during the *wu* hour; from the evening of the eighteenth to the twentieth day, apply it during the *si* and *wei* hours; from the twenty-first to the early twenty-third day, apply it during the *chen* and *shen* hours; from the evening of the twenty-third to the twenty-fifth day, apply it during the *mao* and *you* hours; from the twenty-sixth to the early twenty-eighth day, apply it during the *yin* and *xu* hours; from the twenty-eighth to the thirtieth day, apply it during the *chou* and *hai* hours. This is the fifth section on the daily application of fire in both morning and evening.\n\nAs for the twelfth month, when the second *yang* arises, the application of the second-grade fire follows the same pattern. From this, one may silently comprehend the progression from the first *yang* to the sixth *yang*.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five**\nMovement and stillness have their constancy; adhere to their guiding line. The four seasons proceed in due order, harmonizing with the *qi*. The firm and the yielding are decisively divided, never encroaching upon one another. The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting. The *Yi* circulates in ceaseless flow, bending and stretching, reversing and repeating#12.\n\nHarmonizing with the *qi* means that when the *yang* arises at the *zi* hour, one may apply the first-grade fire. Though month, hour, and day converge, the fire may still be applied gradually, never in rapid succession. For instance, if one hastily applies the fire of the *chou* and *yin* hours, it will only bring harm. Why? Because those two hours lack the corresponding second or third *yang* to respond. This is why it is prized to harmonize with the *qi*.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six**\nBetween the dark and new moons, the signs align and proceed in accord. Primal chaos and the vast expanse unite; the female and male follow one another. Essence and moisture flow and permeate, bestowing transformation and circulation. The numinous brightness of Heaven and Earth#13 cannot be measured. Employ them to secure the body, concealing form and hiding away.\n\nIt begins in the northeast, in the region of *Ji* and *Dou*. Revolving rightward, it spews forth the wheel’s radiance and spits out the sprout’s light. From the hidden depths, the obscure#14 scatters its luminous essence. From the new moon to the dark moon, the fire grades must all align precisely, without excess or deficiency. Only from the first quarter to the last quarter does the primal chaos prevail, where female and male unite, and the essences of *Kan* and *Li* flow and circulate. It is fitting to gather and respond during the *chou* and *yin* hours, which correspond to the degrees of *Ji* and *Dou*. The rightward revolution is retrograde motion. The spewing wheel is the moon’s radiance; the spitting sprout is the sun’s radiance. The hidden depths are the palaces of *Kan* and *Li*.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven**\nAbove the *Bi* constellation, *Zhen* emerges as the omen. The *yang* *qi* initiates its inception; the first nine is the hidden dragon. *Yang* is established by threes; *yin* communicates by eights. Thus, on the third day, *Zhen* stirs; on the eighth day, *Dui* proceeds. The second nine is the visible dragon, harmonious and luminous. When the virtues of three and five are perfected, the *Qian* body is complete. The third nine remains vigilant at dusk, its divine tally diminished and broken. As prosperity and decline gradually transform, it ultimately returns to its origin. *Xun* continues its lineage, firmly securing and upholding. The fourth nine hovers in hesitation, advancing and retreating along a perilous path. *Gen* governs cessation and progression#15, never transgressing#16 the proper time. On the twenty-third day, it guards the appointed moment of the crescent. The fifth nine is the soaring dragon, ascending to the celestial position with joy. The sixth five, *Kun* submits, binding and encompassing the beginning and end. It nurtures the multitude of offspring, becoming the mother of all its kind. The ninth above is the dragon in excess, waging virtue’s battle in the wilds. When the nine is employed, it flutters lightly, serving as the Dao’s compass. The *yang* numbers are exhausted, and once exhausted, they arise anew. Pushing forth the emotions to unite with nature, they turn and intertwine.\n\nAbove the *Bi* constellation lies the *geng* direction. The first *yang* arises, corresponding to the *Zhen* hexagram and the *chufu* line of the first nine. On the third day, life begins to brighten. On the eighth day, the first quarter arrives, and the second *yang* flourishes, corresponding to the *Dui* hexagram and the line of the second nine. On the fifteenth day, the three *yang* are full, corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram and the line of the third nine.\n\nOn the sixteenth day, the first *yin* arises, corresponding to the *Xun* hexagram. In terms of the pure *Qian* hexagram, this is the line of the fourth nine. The lower quarter is the *Gen* hexagram, called \"not to exceed the proper time,\" meaning that in measuring the slightest weights, one must not go beyond. In terms of the pure *Qian* hexagram, this is the line of the fifth nine. From the twenty-third to the thirtieth day, it is the *Kun* hexagram. Thus, it is spoken of as *Kun* bearing *Qian*. Yet when referring to the sixth five, it is because all *yin* symbols take *Kun* as their master, hence the use of the sixth five. In the pure *Qian*, this is the line of the ninth nine, where *yang* has been entirely consumed and *yin* reaches its extreme before rebirth, thus concluding with the \"use of nine.\"\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven**\nFollowing the turning of the *xuanji*, ascending and descending, rising and falling. Circulating through the six lines, it is difficult to observe. Thus, it has no fixed position and serves as the ancestral foundation of the *Yi*. The *xuanji* is the instrument for correcting celestial patterns. When *yang* *qi* arises, it moves from below upward; when *yin* *qi* descends, it moves from above downward. Circulating through the six lines, they wax and wane within them, forming the sixty-four hexagrams, which cannot be reduced to rigid rules. This interplay of hardness and softness is why they are the ancestral foundation of the *Yi*.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight**\nAt the dawn of the new moon, it is the *Fu* hexagram, where *yang* *qi* first flows through. Its entry and exit are without haste, and the erected gnomon reveals subtle strength. The *Huangzhong* pitch corresponds to the *zi* month, and its signs begin to flourish. Spreading warmth and softness, the common people receive their constant sustenance.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine**\nAt the *Lin* hexagram’s furnace, the kindling is applied, opening the path to true radiance. The brilliance gradually advances, increasing day by day. The *Dalü* of the *chou* month binds and adjusts the balance.\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\nLooking upward, it forms the *Tai* hexagram, where hardness and softness flourish together. *Yin* and *yang* intertwine, the small departing and the great arriving. Converging at the *yin* month, it moves in accord with the seasons.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One**\nProgressing through the *Dazhuang* hexagram, it flanks the gate of the *mao* month. Elm pods fall and return to their roots. Punishment and virtue bear one another, and day and night begin to divide.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two**\nIn the *Guai* hexagram, *yin* has retreated, and *yang* advances forward. Washing and cleansing its wings, it shakes off the dust of slumber.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three**\nThe *Qian* hexagram is vigorous and bright, broadly covering the four neighbors. *Yang* ends at the *si* month, where it interacts at the center.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four**\nThe *Shen* hexagram begins the sequence, treading frost first. The cold spring at the well’s bottom, the *wu* month as the guest of the vine. The guest submits to *yin*, and *yin* becomes the host.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five**\nThe *Lin* hexagram departs from its position, gathering its essence. Cherishing virtue and awaiting the time, its handle lingers in obscurity.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six**\nThe *Pi* hexagram is blocked and impassable; what sprouts cannot grow. *Yin* extends while *yang* is subdued, and *yang*’s name is erased.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven**\nIn the *Guan* hexagram, observe its measures and weigh the conditions of mid-autumn. Nurturing the young and tender, the old and withered revive. Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew, growing beneath the cover of what came before.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight**\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine**\nIn the *Bo* hexagram, the limbs rot and the form dissolves. The transforming *qi* is exhausted, and the supreme spirit is lost.\n\n**Chapter Sixty**\nWhen the Dao reaches its limit, it turns back, returning to the origin of *Kun*. In *Heng*, it follows earth’s patterns, receiving heaven’s decree and spreading its mandate. This speaks of the twelfth month’s fire, which is the fire of the year. Only in the third, eighth, and twelfth months is fire not used—because fire is defeated in the third, dies in the eighth, and perishes in the twelfth. This is the principle in the five phases where metal’s birth fears fire’s death, so fire is extinguished in response.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One**\nThe profound and distant Dao, though veiled and partitioned, remains interconnected. It responds to measure and nurtures the seed, the origin of *yin* and *yang*. Vast and indistinct, its beginning is unknowable. Those who first stray from the crimson path later become lords. No level ground remains uninclined—such is the Dao’s nature. Change and renewal alternate, waxing and waning in mutual dependence. Ending with *Kun* and beginning with *Fu*, it cycles like an unbroken ring. Emperors and kings inherit and uphold it, its design enduring for a thousand generations. The profound and distant Dao, though veiled and partitioned, refers to *Kan* and *Li*, which are remote yet truly connected. \"Responding to measure\" denotes the phases within the waxing and waning crescents. \"Nurturing the seed\" is the origin of *yin* and *yang*. *Yin*’s origin begins in *Li*, while *yang*’s origin resides in *Kan*. \"First straying\" means *Li*’s *yin* does not take the lead; thus, the waxing crescent first nurtures *yang*’s origin, while *yin*’s nurturing occurs in the waning crescent. \"Becoming lords\" also reflects the male’s rightful place without and the female’s within.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two**\nTo cultivate one’s nature and prolong life, deferring the appointed end, one must carefully consider the future and contemplate its origins. The body one receives is fundamentally formless. The primordial essence scatters like clouds, relying on *qi* to establish its beginning. \"The future\" refers to the matter of prolonging life and deferring the end. \"Its origins\" means the moment of conception, which begins from nothingness. Once the primordial essence disperses and *qi* establishes its foundation, the hundred bones and nine orifices are all complete. The method of returning the elixir is precisely based on this.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three**\n*Yin* and *yang* serve as measures, the dwelling of *hun* and *po*. The *yang* spirit is the sun’s *hun*; the *yin* spirit is the moon’s *po*. *Hun* and *po* mutually serve as each other’s abode. The nature presides within, establishing its form. The emotions operate without, constructing walls and outer defenses. When the defenses are complete, people and things find peace. At this time, emotions align with *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* moves directly, spreading *qi* and flowing essence. *Kun* is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s dwelling. The firm acts and retreats; the yielding transforms and flourishes. Nine returns, seven reversals, eight reunions, six residences. The male is white, the female red—metal and fire restrain each other. Then water settles fire, the beginning of the five phases. Supreme goodness resembles water, clear and flawless. The Dao’s form is elusive; the true one is difficult to depict. Though transformed and dispersed, each abides in its own place. *Hun* and *po* mutually serve as each other’s abode. In terms of fire phases, the sun’s *hun* joins the moon’s *po*, embodying the principle of advance and retreat. In terms of *Kan* and *Li*, the essence and *qi* of *Kan*’s male cannot be nurtured without *Li*’s female womb to form the golden elixir. In terms of the body, the hundred bones, nine orifices, six bowels, and five viscera cannot endure without the *qi* of the five metals as their root. Thus, the fire, *qi*, and spirit that constitute the *hun* are ultimately bound to the corporeal, which is the *po*. Without *po*, the *hun* has no dwelling; without *hun*, the *po* becomes discarded matter. Therefore, what operates without serves the emotions and *po*, while what resides within serves the nature and *hun*. *Qian* moves directly, spreading *qi* and flowing essence, akin to male union. *Kun* is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s dwelling, akin to the female womb. Thus, when the firm acts and retreats, the yielding transforms and flourishes even more. For those who cultivate the elixir, nine returns, seven reversals, eight reunions, and six residences follow the same principle. \"Nine returns\" refers to three thousand completed practices, totaling nine years, symbolizing the nine months of gestation. \"Seven reversals\" refers to lead, mercury, dragon, tiger, blood, *qi*, and spirit—all returning to the three fields. \"Eight reunions\" refers to eight hundred achievements: one ounce per month, ninety-six ounces per year, accumulating over nine years to eight hundred ounces, returning to the elixir field. \"Six residences\" refers to heaven and earth’s six children. In the first three years, the eldest son and daughter are nurtured in the lower field; in the middle three years, the middle son and daughter are nurtured in the middle field; in the final three years, the youngest son and daughter are nurtured in the upper field. The \"male white\" is the metal within *Kan*; the \"female red\" is the cinnabar within *Li*. \"Water settles fire\" refers to the earlier principle of stabilizing the furnace’s weights and measures. \"Supreme goodness\" is the *yin* within *Li*; from the Dao’s generation of the one, it becomes the *yang* within *Kan*. From the transformations of *Kan*’s *yang*, the five viscera, six bowels, hundred bones, and nine orifices all find their proper places.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three (continued)**\nIt resembles a chicken’s egg, white and black conjoined. A span of one *cun* marks its beginning. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all complete. After ten months, it emerges from the womb. Its bones are soft and pliable; its flesh smooth as lead. This describes the process from conception to birth. A span of one *cun*: I once read in the *Classic of Difficult Issues* that the body’s own *cun* serves as a measure, corresponding to the standards of *sheng* and *dou*, where a square *cun* equals one *liang*. Thus, the beginning of human gestation also starts from this single *cun*.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four**\nDoes the earlier mention of eight *liang* find its determination here?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five**\nThe *yang* burning-mirror draws fire—without the sun, no light is born.\nThe square vessel of *fangzhu* cannot yield water or broth without stars or moon.\nThe two *qi*, dark and distant, still respond in mutual transformation.\nHow much more so for that which dwells near in the body, pressing close to heart and chest?\n*Yin* and *yang* pair with moon and sun; water and fire serve as their proofs.\nThis speaks of *Kan* as the moon, within which lies water;\n*Li* as the sun, within which lies fire.\nWhat difference is there between this and the *yang* burning-mirror drawing fire or the *fangzhu* gathering water?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\nEars, eyes, and mouth—the three treasures—\nfirmly sealed, do not let them scatter abroad.\nThe true person lurks in the deep abyss,\nfloating and wandering, abiding by the compass’s center.\nCoiling and bending to see and hear,\nopening and closing, all in perfect accord.\nThey serve as the pivot and linchpin of the self,\nin movement and stillness, inexhaustible.\nThe *qi* of *Li* inwardly nourishes defense and guard;\n*Kan* then ceases to rely on hearing.\n*Dui* unites in silence,\nrare speech follows the primal chaos.\nOnce these three are secured as the mechanism’s keys,\nrelax the body and dwell in an empty chamber.\nEntrust the will to emptiness and nothingness,\ntaking absence of thought as the constant.\nProof is difficult to shift;\nthe mind, focused, does not stray.\nIn sleep, spirit embraces spirit;\nin waking, one awaits the signs of presence or absence.\nThe countenance gradually grows moist,\nthe bones and joints ever more firm and strong.\nRepel the host of *yin* perversities,\nthen establish the true *yang*.\nCultivate this without cease,\nand the *qi* will drift like clouds and rain.\nGentle as spring’s moisture,\nflowing like melting ice.\nFrom the head, it streams down to the feet,\nthen ultimately ascends again.\nComing and going, it penetrates the boundless,\npervading the vessel’s interior.\nReversion is the Dao’s verification;\nweakness is virtue’s handle.\nWeed and hoe the long-accumulated filth,\nso that the subtle is finely tuned and harmonious.\nThe turbid finds the path to clarity;\nlong darkness yields to radiance.\nReversion means the old man returns to youthful vigor,\nthe aged woman becomes a maiden—this is the Dao’s verification.\nWeakness means that the humble are honored by others,\nthe lagging are placed first—thus it serves as virtue’s handle.\nFilth refers to one’s own unvirtuous conduct.\nThe subtle refers to the Dao’s essence.\nTurbidity and darkness refer to the Way of blending light and merging with the dust,\nburying brilliance and smoothing away luster.\nThese all describe the cultivation of the Dao in the external.\nFrom “pervading the vessel’s interior” onward,\nall describe the cultivation of the Dao within.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Li corresponds to the eyes, Kan to the ears, Dui to the mouth.\" Each of these harbors its own spirit. It speaks of \"firmly sealing\" and \"securing the barriers\"—the eyes may indeed be closed, the mouth firmly shut, yet the ears must be covered with both hands. It further says: \"Relax the body in an empty chamber.\" This means that during waking and sleeping, one should close the eyes, cover the ears, seal the mouth, and clench the teeth, so that within, one constantly hears the sound of wind and thunder, the fiery qi roaring ceaselessly—thus the spirit and qi naturally abide. In this way, yin evil is entirely repelled, and true yang establishes itself. Diligently practicing this, harmonious qi flows smoothly, and the cultivation within is thus achieved.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\nPeople favor petty arts,\nunaware of the Dao’s depth.\nThey abandon the proper path for deviant shortcuts,\nseeking speed yet finding no passage.\nLike the blind refusing a staff,\nor the deaf straining to hear gong and shang,\nthey plunge into water to catch pheasants and hares,\nor climb mountains in search of dragons and fish.\nThey plant wheat hoping for millet,\nor wield a compass to draw a square.\nExhausting their strength and spirit,\nthroughout the year they see no success.\nTo know the method of ingesting qi,\nthe matter is simple and not complex.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven**\nThose in the world who delight in goodness\ninitially lack broad insight.\nUpon learning some minor technique, they rejoice beyond measure,\nbelieving none in the world could surpass them—\nthis is precisely how they deceive themselves.\n\nThe radiant pearl of the Great Yang\never seeks to depart from man.\n\nSwiftly obtaining the Golden Flower, it transforms in mutual succession.\nAlchemized into white liquid, congealing to utmost firmness.\nThe Golden Flower first intones—within a brief interval,\ndissolving and transmuting into water, its abundance like horse-teeth in ranks.\n\nThe Yang then advances to harmonize,\ntheir natures and dispositions naturally aligned.\nYet the pressing Yin of the hour\nconfines and restrains, barring the gate.\n\nThe compassionate mother nurtures and rears,\nthe filial son repays her kindness.\nThe stern father issues commands,\ninstructing and admonishing his descendants.\n\nThe Five Phases contend for dominion,\neach relying on the other to engender life.\nFire’s nature melts metal,\nmetal severs the flourishing wood.\n\nThe Three, the Five, and the One—\nthe utmost essence of Heaven and Earth.\nThis may be transmitted by oral instruction,\nbut is difficult to convey in writing.\n\nThe Great Yang is the head.\nThe Flowing Pearl is the fluid of the lungs.\nThe *Huangting Jing* speaks of the seven fluids surging through the central chamber—\nthe chamber refers to the space between the brows.\n\nOnly this one fluid\nis easily lost from man,\nfor all revile it.\n\nThe Golden Flower is the fluid of the kidneys.\nThe lungs correspond to metal, the kidneys to water;\nmother and child gather together,\ntheir abundance likened to horse-teeth in ranks.\n\nThe Yang is the solar soul,\nalso called the nature.\nThe compassionate mother is Kun.\nKun is the abdomen, giving birth to the fluids of the five viscera—\nthus the fluids of the five viscera nourish the body.\n\nThe stern father is Qian.\nQian is the head, requiring the fluids of the five viscera\nto ascend to the Mud-Pill Palace before they can be alchemized into the Golden Elixir.\n\n\"Fire’s nature melts metal\" refers to the fluid of the Li Palace,\nwhich is drawn at the lower quarter—\nthe lower quarter resembles autumn,\nits position in the west, the time when metal flourishes.\n\n\"Metal severs the flourishing wood\" refers to the fluid of the Kan Palace,\nwhich is flown at the upper quarter—\nthe upper quarter resembles spring,\nits position in the east, the time when wood flourishes.\n\nThe Three are the heart, lungs, and liver.\nThe Five is the spleen.\nThe One is the kidneys.\nTo refine the Golden Elixir,\none must rely on these—\nhence they are called the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight**\nAt midnight, turn to the right;\nat noon, revolve to the east.\n\nAt the boundary between Mao and You, host and guest assume their names.\nThe Dragon calls to the Tiger; the Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence.\nEach feeds upon the other, both coveting the advantage—\nthus they interlock and swallow, chewing and devouring one another.\n\nMars guards the west; Venus traverses the heavens.\nWhere the killing qi descends, what can stand unshaken?\nThe wildcat and dog guard the mouse; crows and sparrows fear the crane.\nEach attains its function—how dare they make a sound?\n\nAt midnight, Kan; at noon, Li—\nturning right and moving eastward is counterflow.\nThis refers to the work of gathering the medicine and flying the golden radiance.\n\nKan resides in the north and below, thus desiring to turn right and ascend.\nLi dwells in the south and above, thus desiring to move eastward and descend.\nMao is wood, the Dragon.\nYou is metal, the Tiger.\nThough the names they govern differ, with one exhalation and one inhalation,\nthe two meet and join, restraining and subduing each other, unable to flee.\n\nThe west and Venus are both metal.\nAt first, metal departs the womb of midnight—\nin the space of a single breath, Mars seizes its guard over metal,\nand so metal follows Mars in traversing the heavens.\nOnce Venus has crossed the sky, it can again subdue the Azure Dragon—\nthus in the sixty-eighth chapter it is said: \"Fire’s nature melts metal; metal severs the flourishing wood.\"\n\nTherefore, *The Scripture of the Yellow Court* states:\n\"Sunrise and sunset, moon’s breath stored—\nthose who attain this all restrain and subdue.\"\nIf not subdued, there will be sound.\n\nShould one fail to grasp the principle, reckless speech avails nothing.\nExhausting the wealth of household and chamber, wives and children suffer hunger and poverty.\nFrom ancient times to the present, countless millions have pursued this path—\nyet few meet with success, and fewer still attain completion.\nSeeking rare medicines far and wide, they stray ever farther from the Dao.\nBut should one truly encounter it, the thread of its beginning becomes clear.\nLike kindred things shatter one another, so too are the ends and beginnings of all things measured.\nThe five phases align and each finds its proper union—this is the mutual resonance of kindred things.\nThe firing times of civil and martial, the ends and beginnings of things.\n\nThe five phases restrain one another, alternating as father and mother.\nThe mother contains the nourishing fluid; the father presides over scrutiny and union.\nEssence congeals and form flows—metal and stone do not decay.\nWith careful focus and no leakage, one attains the completion of the Dao.\nErect a pole and the shadow appears; call into the valley and the echo resounds.\nIs this not wondrous? The supreme image of heaven and earth.\nYet if one takes a mere inch of *Gelsemium* or an ounce of *Croton*, swallowing brings instant collapse, unable even to lift the head.\nAt such a moment, though Zhou Wen and Cao of divination, Confucius of hexagrams, Bian Que with his needles, or Wu Xian with his drums were present—\ncould they revive the fallen or restore them to swift motion?\nWhen the five phases are made to restrain and subdue one another, they do not flee.\nNot fleeing, they can then engender one another.\nThus, as surely as a pole casts a shadow or a valley returns an echo, the gathering of the five phases yields the elixir—this much is clear.\n\nThe maiden by the river’s edge—spirit-like, most divine.\n\nThe moment fire is obtained, it takes flight, leaving no trace of dust.\nGhosts conceal themselves, dragons hide away—none know where they abide.\nShould one seek to master it, the Yellow Sprout serves as the root.\nThe maiden is the qi of the five flowers within *Li*.\nThe *Classic* often speaks of \"closure\"—\nthis is to prevent its scattering outward.\nThis is not the qi sought through breath.\nWithin this qi lies the True One’s water, for qi is the mother of water.\nThe Yellow Sprout is the transformation of the *Kan* metal.\nThese two, female and male, seek one another, yet cannot be grasped together.\n\n---\n\nThings devoid of yin and yang violate heaven and forsake the Origin.\nWhen a hen hatches her own eggs, her chicks are incomplete.\nWhy is this so?\nUnion was not achieved, the Three and Five failed to merge, hardness and softness parted ways.\nThe essence of transformation is the natural work of heaven and earth—\nas fire moves and flames rise, as water flows and moistens below.\nNo teacher guides them; such is their nature.\nThe origin governs all, and this order cannot be altered.\nObserve the mating of female and male:\nhardness and softness bind, inseparable.\nWhen their rhythm aligns, no craft or control is needed to govern them.\nAs a boy is born curled forward, a girl lies supine—\nthey receive this from the womb, the breath of the primal beginning.\nNot only at birth is this manifest;\neven in death, they replicate it.\nThis is not taught by parents—\nit is fixed at the moment of union, determined from the very start.\nThe boy born curled forward illustrates *Kan* as male, its lines gathered inward.\nThe *Yellow Court Classic* calls this \"the posterior humbled.\"\nThe girl lying supine illustrates *Li* as female, its lines gathered upward.\nThe *Yellow Court Classic* calls this \"the anterior raised.\"\nOnly thus is the meaning of union achieved, hence the later seven or eight chapters speak of \"child south, noon north.\"\n\n---\n\n*Kan* male is the moon, *Li* female is the sun.\nThe sun bestows virtue, the moon unfurls its light.\nThe moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed.\nWhen yang loses its bond, yin encroaches upon its brightness.\nAt new and full moons, eclipses press close, veiling and overwhelming one another.\nYang’s form wanes, yin’s encroachment brings calamity.\nMale and female depend on each other, inhaling and exhaling to nurture.\nFemale and male intermingle, seeking their kind.\nBestowing virtue and unfurling light—this is how male and female depend on each other, seeking their kind.\nOnly when the sun’s spirit joins the moon’s essence—this is called \"conducting fire.\"\nAt the cusp of new and full moons, the moon’s essence may sometimes eclipse the sun.\nWhen the new moon dawns, one should apply subtle yang, lest yin’s qi overpower yang too severely, risking harm.\n\n---\n\nMetal transforms into water, water’s nature flows freely.\nFire transforms into earth, and water cannot move.\nThus the male acts outwardly, the female remains inwardly still.\nIf excess transgresses measure, the female restrains him.\nThe essence must bind the spirit, preventing wanton indulgence.\nNeither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in due time.\nEach attains harmony, together they emit the proof of their union.\n\nThe male moves and acts outwardly, the female remains still and stores inwardly—this accords with the \"Upper Virtue\" and \"Lower Virtue\" in the twenty-second chapter.\n\n---\n\nCinnabar is the essence of wood, and only when it meets metal do they unite.\nWhere metal and water converge, wood and fire take the lead.\nThese four merge in primordial chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger.\nThe dragon, yang in nature, bears an odd number; the tiger, yin in nature, bears an even one.\nThe liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, are the mother.\nThe kidneys, black, are the child; the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor.\nThe child marks the beginning of the Five Phases; the Three Substances form one household, all converging in *wu* and *ji*.\nCinnabar is the qi of the heart.\nThe liver belongs to wood and thus can generate fire.\nMetal is the fluid of the lungs, ever united with the liver’s fluid.\nYet metal’s child is water, so it joins with wood;\nits child is also fire, so it leads with fire.\nThe liver is the dragon, bearing the number three, father of fire.\nThe lungs are the tiger, bearing the number four, mother of water.\nThe kidneys are the child of metal; the spleen is the kidneys’ ancestor.\nThe Three Substances are: wood and fire as one, metal and water as two, earth as three.\nOne household refers to all that dwells within this body.\n*Li* governs *ji*, *Kan* governs *wu*—the merit and fruition return to them.\n\n---\n\nHard and soft arise in alternation, traversing their respective domains.\nDragon to the west, tiger to the east, establishing the weft at *mao* and *you*.\nPunishment and virtue meet as one, rejoicing in their encounter.\nPunishment presides over subjugation and killing; virtue presides over generation and ascent.\nIn the second month, the stolen *luo* star arrives at *mao*;\nin the eighth month, wheat sprouts as Heaven’s *ju* star occupies *you*.\nNorth at *zi*, south at *wu*—each serves as the other’s guiding principle.\nThe numbers one and nine end only to begin anew.\nEmbracing the primordial in *Xu* and *Wei*, they sow essence at *zi*.\nEast is *Zhen*, the liver, the dragon.\nWest is *Dui*, the lungs, the tiger.\nSouth is *Li*, the heart.\nNorth is *Kan*, the kidneys.\nFrom the waxing half-moon to the fifteenth day, the metal of the *Kan* palace takes flight, moving from north to south;\nfrom the sixteenth to the waning half-moon, the elixir of the *Li* palace is gathered, moving from south to north—hence \"north at *zi*, south at *wu*.\"\nYet the dragon ever follows fire, the tiger ever follows water, so *Kan* and *Li* unite in marriage.\nAnd metal and wood cannot be sundered, so the dragon couples with the tiger, the tiger with the dragon—thus \"dragon to the west, tiger to the east.\"\nIn essence, the golden elixir centers on the metal of *Kan*, and in the end returns to embracing the primordial in *Xu* and *Wei*, sowing essence at *zi*.\n\n---\n\nBy riverside islets, the turtledoves call to one another.\n\nFair and graceful is the noble maiden,\nthe gentleman’s fine mate.\nThe male does not dwell alone,\nthe female does not live in solitude.\nThe Dark Warrior—tortoise and serpent—coil and intertwine.\nThus do yin and yang make plain:\neach must have the other.\n\nWere two women to share a chamber,\nthough their beauty be as sisters,\nand Su Qin send his eloquence,\nZhang Yi broker the match,\nunleashing persuasive tongues,\ndeploying honeyed words,\npouring out their hearts to harmonize,\nseeking union as husband and wife—\nyet with hair worn thin and teeth decayed,\nthey would never truly know each other.\n\nIf herbs and minerals are not of the same kind,\ntheir names and categories differ.\nTheir proportions misaligned,\ntheir guiding principles lost—\nthough the Yellow Emperor tend the furnace,\nthe Great One hold the flame,\nthe Eight Lords refine and temper,\nHuainan blend and harmonize,\nerecting lofty altars,\nsteps of jade laid beneath,\noffering unicorn jerky and phoenix-cured meats,\nprostrating in long obeisance,\npraying to the spirits,\npleading with the ghosts,\nbathing in purity, fasting in reverence,\nhoping for some sign—\nit would be like mending a cauldron with glue,\nor plastering a wound with porridge,\nadding water to ice to dispel cold,\nor using hot broth to quench heat:\nthe flying tortoise and dancing serpent\nwould only grow more erratic.\n\nSince the opening of heaven and earth,\nthere has been yin and yang after sky and land;\nthere have been husband and wife after male and female;\nthere have been hun and po after sun and moon;\nthere have been qi and fluids after heart and kidneys.\nThe essential truth lies in the union of above and below,\nthe coupling of female and male—\nonly then does the principle of endless generation arise.\nHow could any single thing stand alone?\n\nVariants from the *Fahui* edition:\n#43 \"Immersing\" (浸) is rendered as \"resting\" (寝).\n#44 \"Repelling\" (排) is rendered as \"warding off\" (辟).\n#45 \"In vexation, clad in the valley’s midst\" (怫佛被容中) is rendered as \"In frustration, wrapped in the valley’s midst\" (弗弗被谷中).\n#46 \"Cultivating\" (耘) is rendered as \"weeding\" (芸).

They ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons, transforming their traces to conceal themselves in obscurity. They contained essence and nourished spirit, aligning their power with the Three Luminaries. Their fluids suffused the interstices of the skin, and their sinews and bones became firm. All perverse influences were dispelled, and the upright qi abided constantly. Through long accumulation, they altered their forms and became immortals.\n\nGrieving for later generations who loved the Dao, they followed the winds of reputation and sketched ancient texts. They composed diagrams and writings to reveal the Way to posterity, exposing the branches while concealing the root. They entrusted their teachings to various minerals, veiling them beneath layers of texts. Scholars who obtained these works spent their lives turning the pages of their cases, sons inheriting their fathers’ pursuits, grandsons treading in their ancestors’ footsteps. Yet through generations of transmission, confusion deepened, and none gained true insight. Thus officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their plowing, merchants forsook their goods, and men of resolve fell into poverty.\n\nI lament this deeply and have therefore compiled this text. Its words are concise and easy to ponder; its matters are few and not cumbersome. I have laid out its principles in order, verifying what can be observed. The weights are numbered, and the sequence follows accordingly. Thus I have composed these disordered verses, opening their gates and apertures. Let the wise examine and reflect, applying their minds to this inquiry.\n\nThe ancient sages ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons, contained essence and nourished spirit, harmonizing their power with the Three Luminaries. Thus their fluids filled the interstices of the skin, their sinews and bones became firm, the upright qi abided constantly, and they attained immortality. Yet the writings they composed to instruct later generations, entrusted to various minerals, bore profound meanings that were hidden and difficult to fathom. Thus later scholars never gained true insight and could not find the gate by which to enter.\n\nNow, the Master of Wei has composed this work so that all may know the measured weights of lead and mercury, the orderly sequence of fire times, and the unbroken cycle of practice. Let scholars examine and reflect all the more carefully.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine**\n\nNo image is greater than Heaven and Earth,\nYet the Mysterious Gorge spans ten thousand li.\nThe River Drum approaches the Star Marker,\nAnd the people are all startled and alarmed.\nThe gnomon’s shadow advances and retreats recklessly,\nAnd for nine years misfortune and calamity befall.\nThe August One gazes upon it,\nAnd the king retreats to reform himself.\nThe passes and barriers rise and fall,\nAnd harmful qi chases and flees.\nThe Jiang and Huai dry up,\nTheir waters flowing into the sea.\nThe female and male of Heaven and Earth\nPace between *zi* and *wu*.\n*Yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of yin and yang,\nEmerging and entering, completing the beginning and end.\nFollowing the Dipper’s handle and the Celestial Pivot,\nGrasping the balance to fix the primal order.\n\nThe Mysterious Gorge between Heaven and Earth is like the waters of the Yellow River descending from the heavens, flowing through the north. In the human body, it corresponds to the northern River Chariot, resembling the River Drum star beside the river. In the human body, this is the *kan* male. The Star Marker is the celestial region of the Northern Dipper. In the human body, it corresponds to the ascent from the northern River Chariot straight up to the Muddy Pellet. The \"people\" are likened to the interior of the body. When one seeks to fly the golden essence, the inner *zhen* must be stirred, hence the term \"startled and alarmed.\"\n\nAs for the gnomon’s shadow advancing and retreating, *kan* is the moon, and the yang within *kan* is the moon’s gnomon shadow. \"Advancing and retreating recklessly\" means retreating without advancing, referring to reckless dissipation like water flowing wildly. Thus Yao suffered nine years of floods, and misfortune and calamity arose. The August One is the Perfected One of the Upper Clarity. Knowing the impossibility, the king must retreat and reform. The king is the spirit of the heart.\n\nThe way of closing the passes must not be careless. If they rise and fall without stability, perverse qi will seize the opportunity to harm. The Jiang and Huai are the waterways of the south. In the human body, they correspond to the yin within *li*, likened to the outflow from the Jade Pool. Their drying up occurs because their waters flow into the sea, unaware of the way of replenishing infusion.\n\nThe female and male of Heaven and Earth do not stray beyond the pacing between *zi* (*kan*) and *wu* (*li*). *Yin* is where fire is born and gathers, what the *Yi* calls \"completing the end and beginning\" in *gen*. *Shen* is where water is born and gathers, what the *Yi* calls \"serving in *kun*\" and \"the work of *kun* in completing things.\" How can one fail to follow the Dipper’s pointer to determine its use?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighty**\n\nAt Fengshan, the cauldron is heated to a boil,\nwhile flames blaze fiercely below.\nThe White Tiger leads the chant at the fore,\nand the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.\nThe Vermilion Bird soars and plays,\nits radiance scattering in five hues.\nYet it encounters the snare’s spread,\npressed down and unable to rise.\nIts cries are mournful and bitter,\nlike an infant longing for its mother.\nOverturned and cast into the scalding trap,\nits feathers and plumage are crushed and broken.\nBefore the water-clock has passed its halfway mark,\nfish-scale ripples surge in playful crests.\nFive-colored images dazzle and gleam,\ntheir transformations without fixed master.\nThe seething cauldron churns and races,\nviolently surging without cease.\nLayer upon layer they pile and press,\nlike interlocking fangs of hounds.\nIts form resembles midwinter ice,\nwith stalactites jutting in disarray.\nTowering and tangled, they mingle and merge,\npiled and propped in mutual support.\n\nThe cauldron is the vessel for heating; Fengshan is lightning.\nThe White Tiger is the fluid of the lungs.\nThe Azure Fluid is the liver, the Dragon.\nThe Vermilion Bird is the heart, exhaling the fivefold radiance of qi.\nThus it bears five hues and pertains to fire.\nWhen fire is restrained by the water of *kan*,\nit is like the Vermilion Bird caught in a net.\nSo fire can only cling to the Azure Fluid, its mother,\nand remain within the cauldron.\nThe water-clock not yet past its halfway mark is the hour of *zi*.\nAt the onset of *zi*, a gentle fire is applied to refine it,\nand so its waves rise like fish scales in playful crests.\nThat its days have no fixed master means the fire’s qi increases daily,\nand thus its transformations are without settled pattern.\nWhen it reaches its peak as martial fire, it surges violently.\nLayered and heaped, like interlocking fangs of hounds,\nlike stalactites in disarray,\nor tangled and propped in mutual support—\nthese describe the ceaseless progression before and after.\n\n**Chapter Eighty-One**\nWhen yin and yang attain their proper pairing...\n\nWhen they abide in serene detachment and steadfast mutual embrace,\nthe Azure Dragon dwells in Chamber Six—\nspring blossoms in the east, the Thunder trigram at *mao*.\nThe White Tiger resides in Encouragement Seven—\nautumn’s awns in the west, the Lake trigram at *you*.\nThe Vermilion Bird rests in Spread Two—\ntrue yang intermingles at the southern *wu*.\nWhen these three come to pay homage together,\ntheir household becomes a chorus of kinship.\n\nAt root there are but two substances,\nyet in the end they become three and five.\nWhen three and five unite with the One,\nall gather and return to the Two Places.\n\nRefine them according to the higher method,\nand the days’ count likewise follows the beginning.\n*Mao*, the Thunder trigram of the east, is where Chamber Lodge resides;\nits season is spring, its things blossom, in man it is the liver, the Azure Dragon.\nIt is called Six because six is water’s perfect number—\nthis refers to the time after the waxing half-moon, the *Great Strength* hexagram at the *mao* position,\nwhich is the water of the Flying Kan Palace.\n\n*You*, the Lake trigram of the west, is where Encouragement Lodge resides;\nits season is autumn, its things bear awns, in man it is the lung, the White Tiger.\nIt is called Seven because seven is fire’s perfect number—\nthis refers to the time within the waning half-moon, the *Contemplation* hexagram at the *you* position,\nwhich is the fire drawn from the Li Palace.\n\n*Wu* is the south, the domain of Spread Star.\nIt is called Two because earth’s two engenders fire.\nYang qi reaches its zenith here, the sun’s essence attains fullness,\nand fire’s qi flourishes to its utmost—thus it is called true yang.\n\nThe Six is lead; the Seven is mercury; the Two is fire.\nWhen these three constantly unite as one, the elixir is achieved.\nFire is an insubstantial thing, yet in truth it is the two substances of lead and mercury.\nIn the end, east’s three and south’s two make five;\nwest’s four and north’s one make five;\nthe central palace of spleen-earth is also five—thus they are called three fives.\nAll return to the cauldron and merge into one.\nThat all gather and return to the Two Places refers to the Mysterious Female and the Tail Gate.\nThe higher method means entering the cauldron.\nTo apply fire according to the days’ count requires even greater caution.\n\nFirst white and then yellow,\nred and black penetrate both inside and out.\nThis is called the First Cauldron,\nits nourishment like a grain of millet.\n\nIt is the work of nature itself,\nnot some devious or false path.\nAs when mountain and marsh qi steam together,\ngiving rise to snow and turning into rain;\nwhen mud dries it becomes dust,\nwhen fire dies it transforms into earth.\n\nLike the *nie* dye turning yellow,\nbecoming glue,\nor yeast and *nie* fermenting into wine—\nthings of the same kind readily yield their effects,\nwhile those of different natures resist skillful transformation.\n\nThis wondrous art alone\nis precise and truthful, without deception.\nTransmitted to countless generations hence,\nits brilliance will be self-evident and verifiable,\nshining like stars across the Milky Way—\nonce mastered, its patterns become clear,\nand the myriad transformations will be visible.\n\nThe lungs belong to Metal, thus white;\nthe spleen to Earth, thus yellow.\nThe spleen’s fluid rises from the Yellow Wild,\nwhile the lung’s fluid descends from the Central Void—\nthese two constantly meet and merge.\nRed is the qi of the heart;\nblack is the qi of the kidneys.\nThese two also constantly serve as inner and outer,\nand when all four gather in the Nine Palaces of Mud,\nit forms the First Cauldron.\n\nWhen the elixir grows to the size of a millet grain,\nit enters the Cinnabar Field—\nis this not the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth?\nHow can it not be like mountain and marsh qi communicating,\ngiving rise to clouds and bringing forth rain?\nWhen fire blazes, mud dries and turns to dust;\nwhen fire subsides, it returns to earth—\nthis is the initial stirring of yang’s spirit in *Zhen*,\nwhich by the fifteenth day fully becomes *Kun*.\nWhen *Kun* is joined with the Yin Talisman,\nthe cinnabar body is restored to its original state.\n\nComing and going, like leaves turning yellow,\nor indigo becoming glue,\nor *nie* transforming into wine—\nall arise from their own nature,\nnot by some external force.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighty-Three: Supplementing Omissions**\n\nThose who expound on the *Cantong Qi* often do so loosely,\nleaving fine details incomplete.\nHere, omissions are filled and gaps sealed,\npresenting the essentials in an orderly manner.\nThough the intent cannot be entirely unified or the themes perfectly aligned,\nthe direction remains unerring.\nEntitled *Five Mutual Resemblances*,\nit fully encompasses the *Great Change*’s nature and essence.\n\nThe Five Phases mutually engage, each finding its match.\nThe ten stems begin with *jia*—Wood is born of three, so *jia* holds the number four;\n*yi* corresponds to *ding*, the civil fire of two, while *bing* is the martial fire.\nYet *jia*’s transformations—like tanned leather or scattered hair—are too broad and vague.\nNow, refining the profound and drawing connections,\nthis is further elucidated:\n\n*Xin* and *geng* belong to Metal, born of four;\n*ren* and *gui* belong to Water, born of one.\nThus, *ren* is true lead, *gui* true mercury, *yi* true mercury—\nending with *ren* and *gui*.\nHeaven and *yi* hold the number three;\nEarth gives birth to Fire, so *bing* and *ding* hold two;\nHeaven gives birth to Earth, so *wu* and *ji* hold five;\nEarth gives birth to Metal, so *geng* and *xin* hold four.\n*Yi*, *ji*, *xin*, and *gui* are the yin stems,\nwhile *xin* and *gui* hold one—these are the yang stems.\nWhat is unseen is yin, manifesting within the Five Phases and the five viscera,\nso the seven and four are matched with yin positions.\nWhat is visible is yang, appearing outside the Five Phases and the five viscera,\nso they are matched with yang stems.\n\n*Yi* should be *chen* (沉), likely a scribal error.\nThe five viscera’s treasures are likened to seventy-two minerals—\nthis is the *Great Change*’s nature and essence,\nas in the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger*,\nall spoken in terms of minerals.\nElsewhere, it speaks of the Five Metals,\nall framed in terms of Metal.\nOr it says the culmination lies in divine water,\nall framed in terms of Water.\nOne moment it speaks of *bing* and *ding* in terms of Fire,\nfor the mercury of the *Li* Palace resides in *ren*,\nas *ren* governs the *Li* Palace.\n*Wu* and *ji* are discussed in terms of medicinal substances,\nfor *kan* governs *wu*, and *li* governs *ji*—\nall are the sources from which medicinal substances arise.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s investigation of furnace and fire matters all stems from a single path, each with its own authentic basis: the three Dao of Metal, Wood, and Fire all emerge from one route. The \"three Dao\" are as follows: Wood (three) and Fire (two) combine to form the number five—this is the first Dao; Metal (four) and Water (one) combine to form the number five—this is the second Dao; the spleen’s fluid pertains to Earth, making five—this is the third Dao. That they are said to \"stem from one\" means all return to the *niwan* (mud-pill palace).\n\n---\n\nBranches, stems, flowers, leaves—\nfruits hang in abundance.\nYet all reside in the rootstock,\nnever losing their fundamental nature.\nWhat is spoken with sincere heart\nis examined and without error.\n\nThe five viscera are likened to a tree:\nbranches, stems, flowers, leaves, and fruits all arise from it.\nYet that these things exist as they do\ndepends precisely on the rootstock never losing its fundamental nature,\nfor it first nurtures them from within.\nThus, the *Bi Fa Ling* (Complete Methods and Commandments) desires first to cultivate the inner elixir,\nand only afterward to refine flying gold essence for the outer elixir—this is the principle.\n\n---\n\nLike the mid-winter season,\nbamboo and trees all wither and break.\n\nAssisting the yang to expound for merchants and travelers,\nthe lord conceals himself deeply.\nIn accord with the season and its celestial signs,\nhe seals his mouth and refrains from speech.\nThe Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless,\nthe Great Mystery (*Tai Xuan*) defies form or description.\nEmpty and still, it cannot be perceived—\nits very frame dissolves into nothingness.\nErrors and missteps lose the thread of affairs,\nwords rebound to harm the speaker.\nDistinguish and order these four images,\nto enlighten those blind to what follows.\n\nWhen the mid-winter season arrives,\nthe myriad things all return to root and restore their mandate,\nthus branches and leaves wither and break.\nTherefore, the lord, following the season’s signs, shuts the passes at the solstice,\nand merchants and travelers do not journey.\nThose who later fail to heed the direction\ndo so because they neglect this return and concealment.\nCultivators of the elixir must know to take the body as a tree,\nthe five viscera as its root,\nand the treasures born of the five viscera as its flowers, leaves, and fruits.\nWhen flowers and leaves have fallen away,\nthe lines (*yao*) gather and conceal them to manure the rootstock.\nThus, when tending the furnace, beyond fixing the weights and measures,\nthe remainder is gathered in—\nas in the twenty-second chapter, where golden sand enters the five interiors,\ndispersing like mist in wind and rain.\n\n---\n*Huiji* #30: A rustic from a secluded valley, a withered life.\n\nOne who clings to plainness and simplicity,\nfinds no joy in fleeting splendor.\nDwelling in remote obscurity,\nhe scorns profit and renown.\nHolding fast to tranquility and detachment,\nhe seeks only peace and calm.\nAt ease in quiet seclusion,\nhe composes these writings.\nHe sings of the Great *Yi* of Master Shu,\nthe legacy of the Three Sages.\nExamining its purport,\nhe finds all principles united in one thread.\nThe Three Sages’ legacy—\nabove, it is in Heaven;\nbelow, it is in Earth;\nbetween, it is in Man—\nnothing is left unembraced.\nThus it is said: *The Yi* aligns with Heaven and Earth.\nWhen sages and worthies rise to high station,\nthey use it to govern the state and pacify the world.\nWhen they are confined to lowly estate,\nthey use it to order the household and cultivate the self.\nYet further, it emerges beyond the dust of the vulgar,\nused to refine the nature,\nor to prolong life—\nnever were these two Ways distinct.\n\n---\n\nThe task lies in following principle,\nto manifest and radiate the spirit.\nWhen spiritual transformation flows unimpeded,\nthe Four Seas know peace.\nSet forth as a calendar,\nit may be followed for ten thousand generations.\nApplied to governance,\nits practice is never cumbersome.\nInwardly drawn to nurture the nature,\nit accords with the naturalness of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.\nThose who hold virtue most deeply\nreturn to the root and revert to the origin.\nIt lies near, within the heart,\nnot apart from one’s own body.\nEmbracing the One without abandonment—\nthus may one endure forever.\nPaired with dietary arts,\nyin and yang are arrayed.\nYet cinnabar from Wudu is cast aside,\nthe Eight Stones discarded.\nFor the cultivator of the elixir,\nif only he follows the constant norms of Heaven and Earth,\nthen the spirit will radiate without fail,\nspiritual transformation flow unimpeded—\nhow could peace not prevail?\nThe School of Yin and Yang employs it as a calendar,\nbestowing the seasons upon the people,\nunchanged through the ages.\nThe Yellow Emperor and Laozi draw upon it to nurture the nature,\nthus knowing the treasures of the self—\nwhat is stored is most profound,\nwhat is generated, inexhaustible.\nWhen flowers, leaves, and fruits have ripened,\nthey symbolize the return to the root and reversion to the origin.\nActing in embrace of the One,\nnever once is it forsaken.\nFurther, they cause yin and yang to pair,\nfulfilling the meaning of generation and completion.\nIf the cultivator of the elixir truly understands this,\nwhat need has he for the Eight Stones of Wudu?\n\n---\n\nDiscerning its use to perfect things,\nthe world holds it in esteem.\n\nArranged in threefold alignment, branches and stems intertwine.\nSame in origin yet different in name, all emerge from a single gate.\nNot merely stacked in parallel phrases—\nthis text’s harmony reveals its truth,\nwhere even rough jade holds discernible beauty.\nWere I to embellish with falsehoods,\nI would only incur superfluous fault.\nThus I name it *The Kinship of the Three*,\noffering but a glimpse of its essence.\nFew in words yet vast in meaning,\ndescendants ought to uphold it.\nAbandoning the times to flee harm,\none takes refuge in the hills and mountains,\nroaming the boundless expanse,\ndwelling among spirits as neighbors.\nTransforming form to ascend as immortals,\nmerged in silence, soundless.\nOnce in a hundred generations, they descend,\nsoaring through the mortal realm.\nSpreading wings of plumage,\nthey incline toward the southwest.\nWhen yang meets calamity—\nfloods and droughts sever the wellspring—\ntwigs and leaves wither yellow,\nlosing their flourishing splendor.\nYet those of good fortune bear one another,\nsteadfast and serene, attaining long life.\n\nWhat \"completes things\" refers to their ripened state, ready for use.\nIf the world could truly savor this,\nclarity would dawn between heart and eye,\nand I know they would treasure it as priceless,\nunmoved even by what the world holds dear.\n\nThe \"threefold alignment\" is the Three-and-Five,\nthough their names differ, they reside within this body.\n\"From a single gate\" means all are perfected from the Mud-Pill Palace.\nYet in cultivating this method,\none must also know the way to preserve the body and evade harm:\nsometimes abandoning the era to depart,\nrelying on the power of hills and mountains;\nsometimes roaming the vast beyond,\nliving beside spirits—all to escape the world.\nOtherwise, one risks sudden misfortune like drought or flood,\nwhere branches rot and leaves wither yellow,\nlosing their radiant glory.\nFor those who walk this path,\nhow could they not choose the fortunate to accompany them?\n\n---\n\n**Ode to the Crucible** (originally preceding the *Supplement*, now appended here)\n\nRound as the Three-and-Five,\ncircumference one foot five inches,\nhollow at the center five inches wide—\nnamed the Great Unity Furnace,\nround as heaven, square as earth,\nshaped like a gourd.\nEach division: one inch one *fen*,\nthickness: one inch one *fen*.\n\nMouth four by eight.\nLips turned outward, folded to a circumference of three feet two inches,\nthe luminous heart spanning one foot across.\nTwo-inch lips.\nA high tier encircling two inches in height.\nLength: one foot two inches.\nIncluding the body, total length: one foot two inches,\nwith eighty measures of water entering the crucible.\nThickness uniform: one inch one *fen*.\nThe belly aligned at three.\nBody, belly, and base—straight through top, middle, and bottom alike.\nSeated with warmth descending.\nThe crucible suspended in its chamber, not touching the ground.\nYin above.\nWater enters.\nYang rushes downward.\nFire below.\nHead and tail in martial alignment:\n*Si* (yang) as tail, *Wu* (yin) as head, *Hai* as martial fire.\nThe middle refined:\n*Si* and *Wu* mediate as civil fire.\nBeginning at seventy, ending after three decades.\nTwo hundred and six, well-tempered and even.\nTogether completing the three hundred and sixty of the celestial cycle.\nYin fire white.\nGreat whiteness, the fire’s number—meeting yin metal, it finds use,\nhence more white than red.\nYellow fang lead.\nLead is the mother of fangs.\nYellow fangs arise from lead.\nTwo sevens gather:\nAzure Dragon in *Fang*,\nWhite Tiger in *Xu*.\nAssisting and aiding humanity.\nAzure Dragon and White Tiger—each the qi of seven lodgings.\nNourishing the brain, stabilizing ascendant mystery.\nAt midnight’s center, divine water and Metal Mother nurture the true child of silver water,\nwarming and fostering the child-pearl.\nAttaining peace and preservation.\nComing and going in play, never leaving the chamber.\nGradually growing great, nature and temperament pure.\nThe Crone and the Infant, nurtured by the Mother’s care, remain only within the crucible.\nReturning to the One, restoring the original source.\nBeginning with the Water Mother as the elixir’s foundation,\nthe Water Mother in turn gives birth to true mercury.\nCherish and revere as lord and minister.\nAfter one full cycle, the toil is most arduous.\n\nGuard it in secrecy, lest confusion and darkness arise.\nThe path is long, and again profound.\nShould one attain this, they unite Heaven and Earth.\nWith the elixir’s touch, the hun and po are purified.\nAttaining longevity, dwelling in the immortal village.\nThose who delight in the Dao seek its root.\nExamine the Five Phases, determine the precise measures.\nContemplate deeply—no need for discourse.\nConceal and preserve, do not transmit the text.\n\nRide the white crane, mount the dragon’s scales.\nRoam the Great Void, pay homage to the Immortal Lords.\nInscribed in the celestial charts, styled as a Perfected One.\n\nThe crucible’s construction takes the middle inch of the left hand’s middle finger as its measure.\nYet the symbolic resonance of this vessel’s design remains imperfectly expounded—let it await the enlightened.\nAs for the fire times, it is said:\n*Begin with seventy, end with three decades.*\nThis speaks only of a single month’s firing.\nMaster Wei’s intent, however, holds that from ten breaths to thirty breaths, none suffice as fire.\nThus, from the first day, forty breaths serve as the starting point;\nthe second day, fifty breaths;\nthe third day, sixty breaths—yet even this falls short.\nWhy? For the moon’s essence only begins to brighten on the third day,\na faint yang, so sixty breaths still cannot be called fire.\nBy the twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days,\nyin qi gradually waxes strong, and the breaths retreat from sixty to fifty, then to forty—hence *ending with three decades.*\n*Beginning with seventy* refers to the fourth day, when seventy breaths are added in a single day before fire may truly be spoken of.\nFrom the fourth day onward, ten breaths are added each day,\nuntil the fifteenth day, when a total of one hundred eighty breaths have accrued.\nThen, from the sixteenth day, the breaths retreat from one hundred eighty to the month’s end,\ncompleting the count of two hundred sixty—thus *two hundred six.*\nCombining seventy with the three decades to match the three hundred sixty of the celestial cycle—this is Master Wei’s intent.\n\nYang begins at *zi* as its head, ending at *si* as its tail;\nyin begins at *wu* as its head, ending at *hai* as its tail.\nThe *martial* between head and tail lies between *si* and *wu*;\nthe *central* lies between *zi* and *hai.*\nYin is the *Li* palace.\nThe *Great White* speaks of the fluid within *Li.*\nYellow-sprout lead is the fluid within *Kan.*\nThe *two sevens* are the seven days specifically mentioned in the *Huangting Jing.*\nFrom the evening of the eighth to the fifteenth is seven and a half days;\nfrom the sixteenth to the noon of the twenty-third is also seven and a half days—\nthus they are collectively referred to as seven days.\n\n*Nourishing the brain* means replenishing the *mud-pill palace.*\n*Stabilizing ascendant mystery* means ascending from the Northern River Chariot.\n*Midnight* refers to the adept in cultivation.\n*Never leaving the chamber* means all lies within one’s own body.\nWhen the Three Fields gradually fill, it is called *completing the fire.*\n*Returning to the One, restoring the original source* means achieving the golden elixir.\n*One full cycle* is the three-altar fire times of a year.\nOne must guard and protect, fearing leakage and loss,\nuntil nine cycles are complete—only then is great accomplishment attained.\nIs the path not long indeed?\n\nThe *Book of Changes* takes *Qian* and *Kun* as its body,\n*Kan* and *Li* as its movement;\nbeginning with *Zhen* and *Xun*,\nending with *Gen* and *Dui.*\nYet *Qian* and *Kun* encompass above and below.\nThe trigrams form three, symbolizing the Three Powers;\ndoubled to six, they accord with the Six Qi;\nthe lines numbered five, they embody the Five Phases;\nmeasuring five with six, they clarify the cycles of return.\nThis is the meaning of *combining the Three Powers and doubling them.*\n\nThese ten days govern the progression of the twelve earthly branches.\nThe *Upper Canon* begins with *Qian* and *Kun*, ends with *Kan* and *Li*;\nthe *Lower Canon* begins with *Xian* and *Gan*, ends with *Jiji* and *Weiji.*\nDivided into nine palaces, ordered by the inverted opposition of *Qian* and *Kun*’s two lines,\nthe sixty-four hexagrams’ lines all proceed from this.\n*Kan* and *Li* are the central qi of yin and yang,\ntheir sequence alternating between inversion and uprightness without change.\n*Zhen, Gen, Xun,* and *Dui,* receiving qi in partiality,\ntheir sequence reverses entirely in opposition.\nAll follow the principle of yin-yang circulation,\nodd and even intermingling, void and solid seeking each other,\nfirm and yielding mutually propelling.\nThe revolutions of Heaven and Earth’s four seasons,\nthe circulation of blood and qi in the human body—\nthe unity of this principle is fully revealed here.\n\nFor things, birth gives rise to form,\nform gives rise to proliferation,\nproliferation gives rise to number.\n*Proliferation* means spreading, extending.\nThe greatness of this expansion is numbered fifty,\nthus the eight bones, nine orifices, five viscera, six bowels,\nhands’ and feet’s digits, combined with the two kidneys,\ntotal fifty.\nThe one not engaged in calculation is the position of the Great Ultimate.\nAs for divining with milfoil,\ndividing into two symbolizes the Two Modes,\nhanging one symbolizes the Three Powers,\ncounting by fours symbolizes the Four Seasons,\nreturning the remainders to the hand symbolizes intercalary months—\nthus it is done twice before hanging.\nThe heavenly number is five, the odd—\nall that is empty and moves: intent, qi, will, wisdom, intellect.\nThe earthly number is five, the even—\nall that is solid and exists: the four limbs, the body.\nThe heavenly number twenty-five:\nthe nine orifices, five viscera, six bowels, five officials.\nThe earthly number thirty:\nthe digits of hands and feet, the twenty-eight bones, the two kidneys.\nIn all, fifty-five—\nthis is how transformations are accomplished and the spirits’ workings are enacted.\nGathering the primal chaos to form essence and qi,\nexhaling and inhaling to harmonize yin and yang,\nacting where there is no action—\nonly thus are transformations fulfilled.\nWisdom and foolishness arise from one nature;\ngood and evil stem from a single thought.\nWhere thought and consideration dwell,\nconsideration extends without limit—\nthis is how the spirits’ workings are enacted.\nThis is what is meant by *the Dao of one yin and one yang,*\nand *the spirits’ unfathomability.*\n\nHeaven and Earth are balanced.\nThe *Qian* hexagram’s counting rods number two hundred and sixteen—\nthis is the tally of sinews and vessels.\nThe *Kun* hexagram’s counting rods number one hundred and forty-four—\nthis is the tally of teeth and bone joints.\nTogether, three hundred and sixty—\ncombining the counts of major and minor sinews, vessels, and bone joints to form a single body,\njust as three hundred and sixty days form a single year.\nThe Master spoke of “meeting the cycle,” yet there remains that which is not yet nurtured.\nThe celestial sphere measures three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees,\nthree hundred sixty-six days in all, fixing the four seasons to complete the year.\nNow speaking of three hundred sixty is to leave six aside for measurement—\nthis follows the principle of the *Great Expansion*’s subtraction of five and one.\nThe Han Confucians, taking three hundred sixty days and three hundred eighty-four lines,\nwith twenty-four lines lacking position,\nthus proposed the theory of “six days and seven parts.”\nFurther excluding the four cardinal hexagrams—*Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui*—\nthey devised the system of twenty-four qi,\nbut this is scarcely a matter of reflection.\nWhen the Master dispersed the two counting rods of *Qian* and *Kun* into three hundred sixty days,\nthe twelve lines of *Qian* and *Kun* no longer held their positions.\nYet all within the hexagrams are none other than *Qian* and *Kun*.\nThe sixty-six days, along with the waxing and waning of the moon,\nyield six days—though called “fullness and conjunction,” they are left empty for use,\nand cannot be excluded.\nThese twelve days correspond to the twelve lines.\nAccumulated as intercalary months, their function knows no end.\nThis principle perpetually circulates within the six voids,\nand only the six voids can set it in motion.\nIn sum, fifty-five is the number of the *Great Expansion*.\nYet only fifty are spoken of daily—\nthe true product of expansion, and only fifty exist.\nFor the operation of the five officials, having already given rise to the consideration of a single heart’s selfishness,\nand setting aside what is unused,\nthe number forty-nine perfectly accords with the correctness of Heaven’s principle.\nThus, this body of ours is not human but Heaven.\nAligning the Heaven within our body with the Heaven above,\nthe shifts of qi and number are as one with Heaven.\nIn cultivating the self, one can exhaust the spirits and know transformation—\nthis is the flourishing of virtue.\nIn divination, fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse are all foreknown.\nIn governing the state and pacifying the world,\nthe three hundred sixty offices of the *Rites of Zhou* correspond to the days, forming the months—\nthere is nothing that cannot be ordered.\nThe Master’s four ways of the sage are all present herein.\nAs for the two *Yijing* texts’ fifty thousand one thousand five hundred twenty words,\nthey correspond to the number of all things—\nthat is, the hairs, down, pores, and orifices of our body.\nAnd within them, the numbers of the ten thousand things of the world are complete.\nThe twelve earthly branches of a day sum a year’s *gen*—\nfour thousand five hundred twenty,\nand the two texts’ words again correspond to this.\nThe *Zihua Zi* states:\nAbove, it divides and completes Heaven;\nbelow, it unites and completes Earth.\nOnce divided, it is named the Center.\nDivision must unite with something—\nit is named Harmony.\nCenter, Mystery, Harmony, and Unity—\nthe ten thousand things are transformed and born.\nThis is what is called “three threes and six sixes,”\nthe four movements that complete the *Changes*,\nthe eighteen changes that form a hexagram.\nEight hexagrams make a lesser completion;\ndrawing them out, extending them by analogy,\nall the world’s capacities are exhausted.\nPushing and expanding them,\nthese are the numbers of Former Heaven.\nThus the Dao is made manifest through them,\nand virtue and conduct are made spirit-like.\nCan one respond to the world’s changes with them?\nCan one assist the divine luminaries?\nThe numinous all derive from the numbers of Heaven One and Earth Two,\nHeaven Three and Earth Four,\nHeaven Five and Earth Six,\nHeaven Seven and Earth Eight,\nHeaven Nine and Earth Ten.\nThe *Hemp-Clad Master* spoke of “Heaven One generating Water,”\nthe qi of *Kan* gestating within *Qian* Metal—\nthese all describe the formation of images.\nOnly when Heaven One and Earth Six unite is Water formed;\n*Qian* and *Kan* combine, and Water is completed in Metal—\nthese describe the formation of forms.\nThough the generating and completing numbers of the Five Phases\nmay be recited even by children,\ntheir meaning is such that even the old and strong do not grasp their import—\nthis is the intent of “accomplishing transformation and enacting the spirits’ workings.”\nThe *Hemp-Clad Master* understood this.\nThus the Master said:\n“One who knows the Dao of transformation—\ndoes he not know the spirits’ doings?”\nAnd again:\n“The *Changes* are without thought, without action,\nstill and unmoving,\nyet responsive and penetrating all the world’s affairs.”\nThe sage uses this to purify the heart,\nretiring and concealing it in secrecy.\nFortune and misfortune share the people’s breath;\nthe spirits know the future, knowledge conceals the past.\nSuch were the wise, perspicacious, and sagely of old—\ndivinely martial yet not slaying.\nThus it is said:\nNo image is greater than Heaven and Earth;\nno transformation is greater than the four seasons.\nNo suspended image is more luminous than the sun and moon;\nnothing is more exalted than nobility and wealth—\nall are but extensions of this.\nThus it is said:\n“Three Heavens and two Earths lean upon the numbers.”\nTest this with the fingers of the hands and feet:\nthe joints of the fingers are two Earths and three Heavens;\nthe joints of the toes are three Heavens and two Earths.\nThe five digits of each hand and foot—\nhere again the number five is manifest.\nThe *Wenyan* of *Qian* states:\n“The great person’s virtue accords with Heaven and Earth,\ntheir brightness with the sun and moon,\ntheir order with the four seasons,\ntheir fortune and misfortune with the spirits.\nPreceding Heaven, Heaven does not oppose them;\nfollowing Heaven, they comply with Heaven’s timing.\nHeaven itself does not oppose them—\nhow much less so humans? How much less the spirits?”\nIn the *Dayou* hexagram, only the fifth line is yin—\nthis too embodies the meaning of leaving five aside.\nAnd the top yang line of Heaven states:\n“From Heaven comes protection—\nauspicious, nothing not beneficial.”\n\nHeaven and humanity are one; when spoken of together, they are the Dao. Thus it is said: The *Book of Changes* proceeds from *Qian* and *Kun* to *Kan* and *Li*, and from *Kan* and *Li* to *Zhen*, *Gen*, *Xun*, and *Dui*—here the forms of Heaven and Earth are complete, and the Dao of the *Changes* is made manifest. From Heaven and Earth come yin and yang; from yin and yang come essence and qi—thus human nature is perfected and our bodies established. Know then that the eight trigrams and nine palaces are none other than the eight members and nine orifices of our bodies, while the five movements and six qi are the five viscera and six bowels within us. In images, numbers, lines, and counting rods, not a single affair is without its essence, spirit, hun-soul, or po-soul; not a single thing is without a single qi circulating through yin and yang, opening and closing. Herein lies the great Dao of the *Book of Changes*.\n\n*Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Lower Scroll, concludes.\n\n*The Lower Scroll of the Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi concludes.*",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Four**\n\nWhen an end is reached, it begins anew.\nThe celestial stems and earthly branches mark the cycles; movement and stillness have their early and late phases.\nThe *Yi* hexagrams conclude with *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji*. Beginning from the first day with *Zhun* and *Meng* and proceeding to the dawn and dusk of the dark moon, it is clear that the cycle ends with *Ji* and *Wei*. Yet when an end is reached, it must have a beginning, so the next month’s first day again commences with *Zhun* and *Meng*.\nNot only do the daily hexagrams follow their sequence, but *Zhun* and *Meng* also operate at the *zi* hour. Five days span two celestial stems, so the first quarter occurs at the *mao* hour, the last quarter at the *you* hour, while on the fifteenth and sixteenth days, the hexagrams operate at the *wu* hour. Their movements thus have early and late phases, which must not be overlooked.\n\n**Chapter Five**\n\nIn spring and summer, the inner body is engaged, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*.\nIn autumn and winter, the outer is employed, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*.\nYang qi arises at *zi* and ascends, hence spring and summer are termed the inner body. Yin qi descends from *wu*, hence autumn and winter are termed the outer use. This speaks of the twelve months’ fire phases.\n\n**Chapter Six**\n\nRewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat.\nThe line texts embody benevolence and righteousness, manifesting joy and anger in due season. Thus aligned with the four seasons, the Five Phases attain their principle.\nIn the *Yi*, the Way of Heaven has yin and yang, the Way of Earth has firm and yielding, and the Way of Man has benevolence and righteousness. When yang reaches spring, it brings forth life; when yin reaches autumn, it brings sternness. Man emulates yang’s life-giving by bestowing benevolence as reward, and yin’s sternness by enacting righteousness as punishment—his joy and anger thus manifest externally.\nFor the adept in cultivation, embodying spring’s life-giving occurs when yang qi is at its peak, at the first quarter of the month, when the golden essence takes flight. For spring belongs to Wood, and the golden essence to the Water of *Kan*. Water engenders Wood, embodying the principle of benevolence. Embodying autumn’s sternness occurs when yin qi is at its height, at the last quarter of the month, when the medicine is gathered. For autumn belongs to Metal, and the medicine of the *Li* palace belongs to Fire. Fire restrains Metal, embodying the principle of punishing rebellion. Thus aligned with the four seasons, how could the Five Phases not attain their principle?\n\n**Chapter Seven**\n\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them.\nHeaven and Earth are the images of *Qian* and *Kun*. \"Establish their positions\" means arranging the positions of yin and yang in correspondence. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*.\n*Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. These two functions have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids, their comings and goings unfixed, their ascent and descent without constancy. Hidden and submerged, they transform within. They enfold the myriad things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao.\nThat *Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun* is because *Qian*, being pure yang, is wholly Heaven’s virtue and cannot act on its own. Thus the *Yi* states: \"Heaven’s virtue cannot be made primary.\" Its function lies in yin—only by guarding foolishness with wisdom and clarity does the dragon’s power become usable. Hence it is said: \"Seeing the dragon without a head is auspicious.\" \"Without a head\" means guarding foolishness.\n*Kun*, being pure yin, cannot employ itself, nor can two lowly things command each other. Thus the *Yi* states: \"Perseverance in correctness is beneficial.\" Its function lies in yang, for self-employment leads to delusion, while finding a master brings benefit. Hence it is said: \"Losing friends in the northeast ultimately brings celebration.\" The northeast is the direction of yang.\nThus the *Qian* hexagram speaks of \"using nine,\" and the *Kun* hexagram of \"using six,\" while the others do not mention \"use.\" When pure yang generates one yin, the central void of *Li* becomes *Qian*’s function. When pure yin generates one yang, the firm center of *Kan* becomes *Kun*’s function. Therefore, among the sixty hexagrams, all yang lines are set in motion by the yin within *Qian*, and all yin lines by the yang within *Kun*. This is why *Qian* and *Kun* are the parents of the hexagrams. They do not stand among the hexagrams themselves, while *Kan* and *Li* serve as their functions.

The father’s essence and the mother’s blood are also *Kan* and *Li* as the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*.

Thus the *Book of Changes* aligns with the heart of heaven. The *Changes* correspond to heaven and earth—none but the sage can fathom this.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nThe *Fu* hexagram establishes the first sprouts;\nThe eldest son inherits the father’s form, the mother founds the primal foundation.\nThe waxing and waning of *Kun* above respond to the pitch-pipes,\nAscending and descending according to the pivot of the Dipper.\nOn the third day, clarity emerges—*Zhen* receives the west at *geng*.\nOn the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*, the first quarter hangs level as a cord.\nOn the fifteenth, the *Qian* body is complete, fullness reaches *jia* in the east.\nThe toad’s slowness and the hare’s radiance—sun and moon share a dual brightness.\nThe toad’s slowness marks the hexagram’s rhythm; the hare spits forth its living light.\nWhen the seventh and eighth days’ course is done, the fifteenth’s count bends low in descent.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\nAt the sixteenth turn, *Xun* receives the mandate, *xin* appears at dawn’s leveling.\n*Gen* aligns with *bing* in the south—on the twenty-third, the last quarter.\nOn the thirtieth day, *Kun* at *yi* loses its companion in the northeast.\nWhen the measure is exhausted, succession passes on, and the embodied *Dragon* is reborn.\nThe place where sun and moon meet is called the *chen*—thus in a year they meet twelve times.\nYet their meeting intersects at the new moon, hence it is said: “Sun and moon unite as jade discs” at the new moon.\nOnly at the new moon’s union do the moon’s dark essence sometimes eclipse the sun.\nYet both sun and moon move in reverse through the heavens—\nthe sun travels one degree per day, while the moon advances slightly more than thirteen degrees daily.\nBy the third day, the moon’s light begins to appear, having already moved nearly forty degrees from the sun.\nThus as the sun sets in the west, the moon receives the sun’s spirit—\nlike pure *Kun* gaining a single yang—this is the *Zhen* hexagram.\nIt appears above the western *geng* position, hence *Zhen* governs *geng*.\nBy the eighth day, the moon has drawn farther from the sun, its yang spirit growing full—\nthis is the *Dui* hexagram. As the sun sets, the moon’s course reaches the southern *ding* position—\nthis is the first quarter, hence *Dui* governs *ding*.\nBy the fifteenth day, sun and moon face each other, and the yang essence is complete—\nthus the *Qian* hexagram. As the sun sets, the moon has risen above the eastern *jia* position, hence *Qian* governs *jia*.\nYet even as the moon’s spirit reaches fullness, by midnight at *ren-zi*, the yin essence has already begun—\nthis is the *Li* hexagram, hence *Li* governs *ren*.\nFrom the sixteenth day onward, the yin essence first appears—\nlike pure *Qian* gaining a single yin—this is the *Xun* hexagram.\nAt the moment the spirit first stirs, its governed direction can be determined by the sun’s setting.\nBut once the yin essence has arisen, its emergence grows ever later,\nand the moon’s position can no longer be fixed by the sun’s descent.\nThus its determination relies on the sun’s rising.\nFrom the sixteenth day onward, as the sun prepares to ascend, the moon first reaches the western *xin* position—\nhence *Xun* governs *xin*.\nBy the twenty-third day, the moon nears the sun again, its yang spirit half-diminished—\nthis is the *Gen* hexagram. As the sun rises, the moon’s course has just reached the southern *bing* position—\nhence *Gen* governs *bing*, the last quarter.\nThe ancients said: “Near one, far three” describes the quarters.\nAt the first quarter, the moon’s forward motion has not yet distanced it far from the sun—hence “near one.”\nAt the last quarter, the moon has drawn much farther and now trails behind the sun—hence “far three.”\nFrom the twenty-third to the month’s end, the yang essence is spent, returning to the *Kun* hexagram.\nAs the sun begins to rise, it reaches the eastern *yi* position—hence *Kun* governs *yi*.\nYet as the yin qi reaches its extreme, the yang essence is already conceived in the dark night at *zi* and *gui*—\nthis is the *Kan* hexagram, hence *Kan* governs *gui*.\nIn the following month, it again receives the sign of *Zhen* at *geng*, hence it is said: “The embodied *Dragon* is reborn.”\nFor *Zhen* is the Dragon.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\n*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end.\nThe numbers seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six likewise correspond.\nThe fifteen numbers of the four directions sum to thirty—\nthe yang qi seeks extinction and concealment.\nThe eight trigrams array the luminaries, their movements never losing the center.\n*Qian* governs *jia*, yet also governs *ren*.\n*Kun* governs *yi*, yet also governs *gui*.\nAccording to the *Horizontal Heavenly Stem Cycle*,\n*Kan* also governs *gui*, and *Li* also governs *ren*—why?\nFor the *Qian* hexagram is pure yang, and at yang’s extreme, a single yin arises—\nthus when *Qian* reaches its yang extreme, *Li* is already born.\nThe *Kun* hexagram is pure yin, and at yin’s extreme, a single yang arises—\nthus when *Kun* reaches its yin extreme, *Kan* is already born.\nHence it is said: “*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end.”\n“The yang qi seeks extinction and concealment” means that by the thirtieth day, it transforms into pure *Kun*, leaving no yang—\njust as by the thirtieth day, the moon has no light.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\nThe primal essence is subtle and hard to perceive—\none infers and verifies through signs and evidence.\nAt rest, observe its images; model its forms.\nErect standards as measures, divine auspices to determine fortune or misfortune.\nIssue decrees in accord with the seasons—\ndo not miss the moment when the lines move.\nAbove, examine the patterns of the *River Chart*;\nbelow, sequence the earth’s flowing forms.\nIn the center, investigate the human heart—\ncompare and consider the Three Powers.\nIn motion, follow the hexagram’s rhythm;\nat rest, rely on the *Image* texts.\n*Qian* and *Kun* put into practice—\nonly then are heaven and earth ordered.\nHow could one not be cautious?\nThe secrets of fire and timing are most refined—\nbeyond the reach of ordinary reckoning.\nOne must carefully investigate and align with them,\ncreating diagrams and images to approximate their forms.\nIs this not what is meant by “above, examine the patterns of the *River Chart*?”",

King Wen, imperial ancestor, structured the forms and composed the line statements. The Master, near-sage and hero, supplemented them with the *Ten Wings*. These three lords, Heaven’s chosen, arose in succession through the ages. Though their excellence followed in steps, their virtue and power did not differ in kind. Their creations built upon what came before, their calculations weighed each fraction with care. What has form is easily measured, but what leaves no trace is hard to contemplate. Their deeds set patterns for emulation, their works established the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* for the world. Lacking innate foreknowledge, they relied on teachers to awaken their understanding. Bright as one who parts the curtains, they opened their eyes and ascended the high terrace. The *Book of Changes* was thus completed by the hands of these three sages—how could it be easily understood?

      "translated_text": "The moon as a celestial body initially possesses only its substance, yet it becomes luminous only after receiving the light of the yang. The primal foundations are Kan and Li. The four refer to the addition of Qian and Kun. \"Entering the void\" means non-application. The chariot carries the sixty hexagrams as it moves. The ruler is the heart-mind.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nWhen the noble person dwells in their chamber and their words are virtuous, they elicit a response even from a thousand *li* away. This speaks of the lord of ten thousand chariots, abiding within the nine-fold chamber, issuing decrees and commands, aligning with the rhythms of yin and yang. Conceal the vessel and await the proper time; do not transgress the hexagrams and months. *Zhun* employs *zi* and *shen*; *Meng* uses *yin* and *xu*. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days. Issuing decrees and commands in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang refers to extracting the elixir and regulating the firing times.\n\nRegarding the sixty hexagrams, one day employs two hexagrams. Regarding the firing process, one day uses two periods—morning and evening. Thus, only *Zhun* and *Meng* are mentioned, as they are the first hexagrams following *Qian* and *Kun*, though their application naturally involves advance and retreat. Hence, the timing differs before and after. For instance, at midnight, the *zi* hour, when the first yang arises, one embodies the single yang and applies the fire. At the *chou* hour, when the second yang arises, one embodies the two yang and applies the fire. By the *si* hour, one employs the sixfold fire. One count corresponds to three qi manifesting as a single yang line. Two counts correspond to three cycles of two qi, manifesting as two yang lines. By six counts, three cycles of six counts manifest the full six yang. This is the way of eight transformations to complete a hexagram.\n\nWhen the inverted yin tally first arises at *wu*, one retreats by one count, applying the fivefold fire. Retreating to the *hai* hour, the six yin are complete, and no fire remains. The statement that *Zhun* employs *zi* and *shen* refers specifically to the *Zhun* hexagram, for it is composed of upper Kan and lower Zhen. The Zhen hexagram begins at *gengzi*, while the Kan hexagram next begins at *wushen*. The statement that *Meng* uses *yin* and *xu* likewise refers to the *Meng* hexagram, for it is composed of upper Gen and lower Kan. Kan begins at *wuyin*, while Gen next begins at *bingxu*. Thus, each hexagram has its own morning and evening.\n\nRegarding the hexagrams of the direct days, the sixty hexagrams are recorded within the twelve hours, their application each having its own sequence. Yet in a single day, fire is not applied beyond two hours, so *Zhun* and *Meng* are cited as the general case.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\nI have briefly set forth the two images, though I have not yet exhausted their details.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Forty-Three**\nEstablishing principles#8 calls for enacting punishments; applying benevolence requires bestowing virtue. Those who defy them meet misfortune; those who follow them attain fortune#9. Consult the calendrical statutes, abide in utmost sincerity and meticulousness. Carefully observe the celestial stems and branches, scrutinizing the waxing and waning. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and harm. From the first to the fifteenth day, brightness is bestowed upon the moon, thus it is called \"applying benevolence.\" From the sixteenth to the thirtieth day, the lunar essence gradually obscures brightness, thus it is called \"enacting punishments.\"\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\nAt the two solstices, the measures change, diverging and twisting in complexity. Midwinter brings scorching heat; midsummer yields frost and snow#10. At the two equinoxes, the directions are askew, no longer aligning with the clepsydra’s marks. Wind and rain fall out of season; floods and droughts contend. Locusts surge like boiling water; strange grasses sprout wildly. Heaven displays its omens; mountains collapse and the earth splits#11. The filial son’s devotion moves the August Ultimate. Near at hand, it issues from his own mouth; afar, it flows into distant lands. Some thereby invite calamity; some thereby secure fortune. Some usher in great peace; some provoke warfare. These four outcomes arise from the heart’s intent.\n\nThe winter solstice corresponds to the *zi* hour; the summer solstice to the *wu* hour; the spring equinox to the *mao* hour; the autumn equinox to the *you* hour. At the winter solstice, when the first *yang* arises, apply the first-grade fire. When the six *yang* reach their peak, apply the sixth-grade fire. At the summer solstice, when the first *yin* arises, reduce the fire by one grade, applying only the fifth grade. When the six *yin* reach their peak, the fire grades are entirely extinguished.\n\nTaking the month of the winter solstice as an example: in one month, only the first-grade fire is applied, always during the *zi* hour. This holds for all twelve months. For instance, from the first to the early third day, apply the fire during the *zi* hour; from the evening of the third to the fifth day, apply it during the *chou* and *hai* hours; from the sixth to the early eighth day, apply it during the *yin* and *xu* hours; from the evening of the eighth to the tenth day, apply it during the *mao* and *you* hours; from the eleventh to the early thirteenth day, apply it during the *chen* and *shen* hours; from the evening of the thirteenth to the fifteenth day, apply it during the *si* and *wei* hours; from the sixteenth to the early eighteenth day, apply it during the *wu* hour; from the evening of the eighteenth to the twentieth day, apply it during the *si* and *wei* hours; from the twenty-first to the early twenty-third day, apply it during the *chen* and *shen* hours; from the evening of the twenty-third to the twenty-fifth day, apply it during the *mao* and *you* hours; from the twenty-sixth to the early twenty-eighth day, apply it during the *yin* and *xu* hours; from the twenty-eighth to the thirtieth day, apply it during the *chou* and *hai* hours. This is the fifth section on the daily application of fire in both morning and evening.\n\nAs for the twelfth month, when the second *yang* arises, the application of the second-grade fire follows the same pattern. From this, one may silently comprehend the progression from the first *yang* to the sixth *yang*.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five**\nMovement and stillness have their constancy; adhere to their guiding line. The four seasons proceed in due order, harmonizing with the *qi*. The firm and the yielding are decisively divided, never encroaching upon one another. The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting. The *Yi* circulates in ceaseless flow, bending and stretching, reversing and repeating#12.\n\nHarmonizing with the *qi* means that when the *yang* arises at the *zi* hour, one may apply the first-grade fire. Though month, hour, and day converge, the fire may still be applied gradually, never in rapid succession. For instance, if one hastily applies the fire of the *chou* and *yin* hours, it will only bring harm. Why? Because those two hours lack the corresponding second or third *yang* to respond. This is why it is prized to harmonize with the *qi*.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six**\nBetween the dark and new moons, the signs align and proceed in accord. Primal chaos and the vast expanse unite; the female and male follow one another. Essence and moisture flow and permeate, bestowing transformation and circulation. The numinous brightness of Heaven and Earth#13 cannot be measured. Employ them to secure the body, concealing form and hiding away.\n\nIt begins in the northeast, in the region of *Ji* and *Dou*. Revolving rightward, it spews forth the wheel’s radiance and spits out the sprout’s light. From the hidden depths, the obscure#14 scatters its luminous essence. From the new moon to the dark moon, the fire grades must all align precisely, without excess or deficiency. Only from the first quarter to the last quarter does the primal chaos prevail, where female and male unite, and the essences of *Kan* and *Li* flow and circulate. It is fitting to gather and respond during the *chou* and *yin* hours, which correspond to the degrees of *Ji* and *Dou*. The rightward revolution is retrograde motion. The spewing wheel is the moon’s radiance; the spitting sprout is the sun’s radiance. The hidden depths are the palaces of *Kan* and *Li*.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven**\nAbove the *Bi* constellation, *Zhen* emerges as the omen. The *yang* *qi* initiates its inception; the first nine is the hidden dragon. *Yang* is established by threes; *yin* communicates by eights. Thus, on the third day, *Zhen* stirs; on the eighth day, *Dui* proceeds. The second nine is the visible dragon, harmonious and luminous. When the virtues of three and five are perfected, the *Qian* body is complete. The third nine remains vigilant at dusk, its divine tally diminished and broken. As prosperity and decline gradually transform, it ultimately returns to its origin. *Xun* continues its lineage, firmly securing and upholding. The fourth nine hovers in hesitation, advancing and retreating along a perilous path. *Gen* governs cessation and progression#15, never transgressing#16 the proper time. On the twenty-third day, it guards the appointed moment of the crescent. The fifth nine is the soaring dragon, ascending to the celestial position with joy. The sixth five, *Kun* submits, binding and encompassing the beginning and end. It nurtures the multitude of offspring, becoming the mother of all its kind. The ninth above is the dragon in excess, waging virtue’s battle in the wilds. When the nine is employed, it flutters lightly, serving as the Dao’s compass. The *yang* numbers are exhausted, and once exhausted, they arise anew. Pushing forth the emotions to unite with nature, they turn and intertwine.\n\nAbove the *Bi* constellation lies the *geng* direction. The first *yang* arises, corresponding to the *Zhen* hexagram and the *chufu* line of the first nine. On the third day, life begins to brighten. On the eighth day, the first quarter arrives, and the second *yang* flourishes, corresponding to the *Dui* hexagram and the line of the second nine. On the fifteenth day, the three *yang* are full, corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram and the line of the third nine.",

Yet when referring to the sixth five, it is because all *yin* symbols take *Kun* as their master, hence the use of the sixth five.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Fifty-Nine**\nIn the *Bo* hexagram, the limbs rot and the form dissolves. The transforming *qi* is exhausted, and the supreme spirit is lost.\n\n**Chapter Sixty**\nWhen the Dao reaches its limit, it turns back, returning to the origin of *Kun*. In *Heng*, it follows earth’s patterns, receiving heaven’s decree and spreading its mandate. This speaks of the twelfth month’s fire, which is the fire of the year. Only in the third, eighth, and twelfth months is fire not used—because fire is defeated in the third, dies in the eighth, and perishes in the twelfth. This is the principle in the five phases where metal’s birth fears fire’s death, so fire is extinguished in response.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One**\nThe profound and distant Dao, though veiled and partitioned, remains interconnected. It responds to measure and nurtures the seed, the origin of *yin* and *yang*. Vast and indistinct, its beginning is unknowable. Those who first stray from the crimson path later become lords. No level ground remains uninclined—such is the Dao’s nature. Change and renewal alternate, waxing and waning in mutual dependence. Ending with *Kun* and beginning with *Fu*, it cycles like an unbroken ring. Emperors and kings inherit and uphold it, its design enduring for a thousand generations. The profound and distant Dao, though veiled and partitioned, refers to *Kan* and *Li*, which are remote yet truly connected. \"Responding to measure\" denotes the phases within the waxing and waning crescents. \"Nurturing the seed\" is the origin of *yin* and *yang*. *Yin*’s origin begins in *Li*, while *yang*’s origin resides in *Kan*. \"First straying\" means *Li*’s *yin* does not take the lead; thus, the waxing crescent first nurtures *yang*’s origin, while *yin*’s nurturing occurs in the waning crescent. \"Becoming lords\" also reflects the male’s rightful place without and the female’s within.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two**\nTo cultivate one’s nature and prolong life, deferring the appointed end, one must carefully consider the future and contemplate its origins. The body one receives is fundamentally formless. The primordial essence scatters like clouds, relying on *qi* to establish its beginning. \"The future\" refers to the matter of prolonging life and deferring the end. \"Its origins\" means the moment of conception, which begins from nothingness. Once the primordial essence disperses and *qi* establishes its foundation, the hundred bones and nine orifices are all complete. The method of returning the elixir is precisely based on this.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three**\n*Yin* and *yang* serve as measures, the dwelling of *hun* and *po*. The *yang* spirit is the sun’s *hun*; the *yin* spirit is the moon’s *po*. *Hun* and *po* mutually serve as each other’s abode. The nature presides within, establishing its form. The emotions operate without, constructing walls and outer defenses. When the defenses are complete, people and things find peace. At this time, emotions align with *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* moves directly, spreading *qi* and flowing essence. *Kun* is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s dwelling. The firm acts and retreats; the yielding transforms and flourishes. Nine returns, seven reversals, eight reunions, six residences. The male is white, the female red—metal and fire restrain each other. Then water settles fire, the beginning of the five phases. Supreme goodness resembles water, clear and flawless. The Dao’s form is elusive; the true one is difficult to depict. Though transformed and dispersed, each abides in its own place. *Hun* and *po* mutually serve as each other’s abode. In terms of fire phases, the sun’s *hun* joins the moon’s *po*, embodying the principle of advance and retreat. In terms of *Kan* and *Li*, the essence and *qi* of *Kan*’s male cannot be nurtured without *Li*’s female womb to form the golden elixir. In terms of the body, the hundred bones, nine orifices, six bowels, and five viscera cannot endure without the *qi* of the five metals as their root. Thus, the fire, *qi*, and spirit that constitute the *hun* are ultimately bound to the corporeal, which is the *po*. Without *po*, the *hun* has no dwelling; without *hun*, the *po* becomes discarded matter. Therefore, what operates without serves the emotions and *po*, while what resides within serves the nature and *hun*. *Qian* moves directly, spreading *qi* and flowing essence, akin to male union. *Kun* is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s dwelling, akin to the female womb. Thus, when the firm acts and retreats, the yielding transforms and flourishes even more. For those who cultivate the elixir, nine returns, seven reversals, eight reunions, and six residences follow the same principle. \"Nine returns\" refers to three thousand completed practices, totaling nine years, symbolizing the nine months of gestation. \"Seven reversals\" refers to lead, mercury, dragon, tiger, blood, *qi*, and spirit—all returning to the three fields. \"Eight reunions\" refers to eight hundred achievements: one ounce per month, ninety-six ounces per year, accumulating over nine years to eight hundred ounces, returning to the elixir field. \"Six residences\" refers to heaven and earth’s six children. In the first three years, the eldest son and daughter are nurtured in the lower field; in the middle three years, the middle son and daughter are nurtured in the middle field; in the final three years, the youngest son and daughter are nurtured in the upper field. The \"male white\" is the metal within *Kan*; the \"female red\" is the cinnabar within *Li*. \"Water settles fire\" refers to the earlier principle of stabilizing the furnace’s weights and measures. \"Supreme goodness\" is the *yin* within *Li*; from the Dao’s generation of the one, it becomes the *yang* within *Kan*. From the transformations of *Kan*’s *yang*, the five viscera, six bowels, hundred bones, and nine orifices all find their proper places.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three (continued)**\nIt resembles a chicken’s egg, white and black conjoined. A span of one *cun* marks its beginning. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all complete. After ten months, it emerges from the womb. Its bones are soft and pliable; its flesh smooth as lead. This describes the process from conception to birth. A span of one *cun*: I once read in the *Classic of Difficult Issues* that the body’s own *cun* serves as a measure, corresponding to the standards of *sheng* and *dou*, where a square *cun* equals one *liang*. Thus, the beginning of human gestation also starts from this single *cun*.",

      "translated_text": "Only the unadorned translation follows:\n\n---\n\nOnly the ancient sages and worthies embraced the Mysterious and held fast to the True. They ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons, transforming their traces to conceal themselves in obscurity. They contained essence and nourished spirit, aligning their power with the Three Luminaries. Their fluids suffused the interstices of the skin, and their sinews and bones became firm. All perverse influences were dispelled, and the upright qi abided constantly. Through long accumulation, they altered their forms and became immortals.\n\nGrieving for later generations who loved the Dao, they followed the winds of reputation and sketched ancient texts. They composed diagrams and writings to reveal the Way to posterity, exposing the branches while concealing the root. They entrusted their teachings to various minerals, veiling them beneath layers of texts. Scholars who obtained these works spent their lives turning the pages of their cases, sons inheriting their fathers’ pursuits, grandsons treading in their ancestors’ footsteps. Yet through generations of transmission, confusion deepened, and none gained true insight. Thus officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their plowing, merchants forsook their goods, and men of resolve fell into poverty.\n\nI lament this deeply and have therefore compiled this text. Its words are concise and easy to ponder; its matters are few and not cumbersome. I have laid out its principles in order, verifying what can be observed. The weights are numbered, and the sequence follows accordingly. Thus I have composed these disordered verses, opening their gates and apertures. Let the wise examine and reflect, applying their minds to this inquiry.\n\nThe ancient sages ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons, contained essence and nourished spirit, harmonizing their power with the Three Luminaries. Thus their fluids filled the interstices of the skin, their sinews and bones became firm, the upright qi abided constantly, and they attained immortality. Yet the writings they composed to instruct later generations, entrusted to various minerals, bore profound meanings that were hidden and difficult to fathom. Thus later scholars never gained true insight and could not find the gate by which to enter.\n\nNow, the Master of Wei has composed this work so that all may know the measured weights of lead and mercury, the orderly sequence of fire times, and the unbroken cycle of practice. Let scholars examine and reflect all the more carefully.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine**\n\nNo image is greater than Heaven and Earth,\nYet the Mysterious Gorge spans ten thousand li.\nThe River Drum approaches the Star Marker,\nAnd the people are all startled and alarmed.\nThe gnomon’s shadow advances and retreats recklessly,\nAnd for nine years misfortune and calamity befall.\nThe August One gazes upon it,\nAnd the king retreats to reform himself.\nThe passes and barriers rise and fall,\nAnd harmful qi chases and flees.\nThe Jiang and Huai dry up,\nTheir waters flowing into the sea.\nThe female and male of Heaven and Earth\nPace between *zi* and *wu*.\n*Yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of yin and yang,\nEmerging and entering, completing the beginning and end.\nFollowing the Dipper’s handle and the Celestial Pivot,\nGrasping the balance to fix the primal order.\n\nThe Mysterious Gorge between Heaven and Earth is like the waters of the Yellow River descending from the heavens, flowing through the north. In the human body, it corresponds to the northern River Chariot, resembling the River Drum star beside the river. In the human body, this is the *kan* male. The Star Marker is the celestial region of the Northern Dipper. In the human body, it corresponds to the ascent from the northern River Chariot straight up to the Muddy Pellet. The \"people\" are likened to the interior of the body. When one seeks to fly the golden essence, the inner *zhen* must be stirred, hence the term \"startled and alarmed.\"\n\nAs for the gnomon’s shadow advancing and retreating, *kan* is the moon, and the yang within *kan* is the moon’s gnomon shadow. \"Advancing and retreating recklessly\" means retreating without advancing, referring to reckless dissipation like water flowing wildly. Thus Yao suffered nine years of floods, and misfortune and calamity arose. The August One is the Perfected One of the Upper Clarity. Knowing the impossibility, the king must retreat and reform. The king is the spirit of the heart.\n\nThe way of closing the passes must not be careless. If they rise and fall without stability, perverse qi will seize the opportunity to harm. The Jiang and Huai are the waterways of the south. In the human body, they correspond to the yin within *li*, likened to the outflow from the Jade Pool. Their drying up occurs because their waters flow into the sea, unaware of the way of replenishing infusion.\n\nThe female and male of Heaven and Earth do not stray beyond the pacing between *zi* (*kan*) and *wu* (*li*). *Yin* is where fire is born and gathers, what the *Yi* calls \"completing the end and beginning\" in *gen*. *Shen* is where water is born and gathers, what the *Yi* calls \"serving in *kun*\" and \"the work of *kun* in completing things.\" How can one fail to follow the Dipper’s pointer to determine its use?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighty**",

For the moon’s essence only begins to brighten on the third day,\na faint yang, so sixty breaths still cannot be called fire.\nBy the twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days,\nyin qi gradually waxes strong, and the breaths retreat from sixty to fifty, then to forty—hence *ending with three decades.*\n*Beginning with seventy* refers to the fourth day, when seventy breaths are added in a single day before fire may truly be spoken of.\nFrom the fourth day onward, ten breaths are added each day,\nuntil the fifteenth day, when a total of one hundred eighty breaths have accrued.\nThen, from the sixteenth day, the breaths retreat from one hundred eighty to the month’s end,\ncompleting the count of two hundred sixty—thus *two hundred six.*\nCombining seventy with the three decades to match the three hundred sixty of the celestial cycle—this is Master Wei’s intent.\n\nYang begins at *zi* as its head, ending at *si* as its tail;\nyin begins at *wu* as its head, ending at *hai* as its tail.\nThe *martial* between head and tail lies between *si* and *wu*;\nthe *central* lies between *zi* and *hai.*\nYin is the *Li* palace.\nThe *Great White* speaks of the fluid within *Li.*\nYellow-sprout lead is the fluid within *Kan.*\nThe *two sevens* are the seven days specifically mentioned in the *Huangting Jing.*\nFrom the evening of the eighth to the fifteenth is seven and a half days;\nfrom the sixteenth to the noon of the twenty-third is also seven and a half days—\nthus they are collectively referred to as seven days.\n\n*Nourishing the brain* means replenishing the *mud-pill palace.*\n*Stabilizing ascendant mystery* means ascending from the Northern River Chariot.\n*Midnight* refers to the adept in cultivation.\n*Never leaving the chamber* means all lies within one’s own body.\nWhen the Three Fields gradually fill, it is called *completing the fire.*\n*Returning to the One, restoring the original source* means achieving the golden elixir.\n*One full cycle* is the three-altar fire times of a year.\nOne must guard and protect, fearing leakage and loss,\nuntil nine cycles are complete—only then is great accomplishment attained.\nIs the path not long indeed?\n\nThe *Book of Changes* takes *Qian* and *Kun* as its body,\n*Kan* and *Li* as its movement;\nbeginning with *Zhen* and *Xun*,\nending with *Gen* and *Dui.*\nYet *Qian* and *Kun* encompass above and below.\nThe trigrams form three, symbolizing the Three Powers;\ndoubled to six, they accord with the Six Qi;\nthe lines numbered five, they embody the Five Phases;\nmeasuring five with six, they clarify the cycles of return.\nThis is the meaning of *combining the Three Powers and doubling them.*\n\nThese ten days govern the progression of the twelve earthly branches.\nThe *Upper Canon* begins with *Qian* and *Kun*, ends with *Kan* and *Li*;\nthe *Lower Canon* begins with *Xian* and *Gan*, ends with *Jiji* and *Weiji.*\nDivided into nine palaces, ordered by the inverted opposition of *Qian* and *Kun*’s two lines,\nthe sixty-four hexagrams’ lines all proceed from this.\n*Kan* and *Li* are the central qi of yin and yang,\ntheir sequence alternating between inversion and uprightness without change.\n*Zhen, Gen, Xun,* and *Dui,* receiving qi in partiality,\ntheir sequence reverses entirely in opposition.\nAll follow the principle of yin-yang circulation,\nodd and even intermingling, void and solid seeking each other,\nfirm and yielding mutually propelling.\nThe revolutions of Heaven and Earth’s four seasons,\nthe circulation of blood and qi in the human body—\nthe unity of this principle is fully revealed here.\n\nFor things, birth gives rise to form,\nform gives rise to proliferation,\nproliferation gives rise to number.\n*Proliferation* means spreading, extending.\nThe greatness of this expansion is numbered fifty,\nthus the eight bones, nine orifices, five viscera, six bowels,\nhands’ and feet’s digits, combined with the two kidneys,\ntotal fifty.\nThe one not engaged in calculation is the position of the Great Ultimate.\nAs for divining with milfoil,\ndividing into two symbolizes the Two Modes,\nhanging one symbolizes the Three Powers,\ncounting by fours symbolizes the Four Seasons,\nreturning the remainders to the hand symbolizes intercalary months—\nthus it is done twice before hanging.\nThe heavenly number is five, the

fifty-five—\nthis is how transformations are accomplished and the spirits’ workings are enacted.\nGathering the primal chaos to form essence and qi,\nexhaling and inhaling to harmonize yin and

      "translated_text": "Heaven and Earth are balanced.\nThe *Qian* hexagram’s counting rods number two hundred and sixteen—\nthis is the tally of sinews and vessels.\nThe *Kun* hexagram’s counting rods number one hundred and forty-four—\nthis is the tally of teeth and bone joints.\nTogether, three hundred and sixty—\ncombining the counts of major and minor sinews, vessels, and bone joints to form a single body,\njust as three hundred and sixty days form a single year.\nThe Master spoke of “meeting the cycle,” yet there remains that which is not yet nurtured.\nThe celestial sphere measures three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees,\nthree hundred sixty-six days in all, fixing the four seasons to complete the year.\nNow speaking of three hundred sixty is to leave six aside for measurement—\nthis follows the principle of the *Great Expansion*’s subtraction of five and one.\nThe Han Confucians, taking three hundred sixty days and three hundred eighty-four lines,\nwith twenty-four lines lacking position,\nthus proposed the theory of “six days and seven parts.”\nFurther excluding the four cardinal hexagrams—*Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui*—\nthey devised the system of twenty-four qi,\nbut this is scarcely a matter of reflection.\nWhen the Master dispersed the two counting rods of *Qian* and *Kun* into three hundred sixty days,\nthe twelve lines of *Qian* and *Kun* no longer held their positions.\nYet all within the hexagrams are none other than *Qian* and *Kun*.\nThe sixty-six days, along with the waxing and waning of the moon,\nyield six days—though called “fullness and conjunction,” they are left empty for use,\nand cannot be excluded.\nThese twelve days correspond to the twelve lines.\nAccumulated as intercalary months, their function knows no end.\nThis principle perpetually circulates within the six voids,\nand only the six voids can set it in motion.\nIn sum, fifty-five is the number of the *Great Expansion*.\nYet only fifty are spoken of daily—\nthe true product of expansion, and only fifty exist.\nFor the operation of the five officials, having already given rise to the consideration of a single heart’s selfishness,\nand setting aside what is unused,\nthe number forty-nine perfectly accords with the correctness of Heaven’s principle.\nThus, this body of ours is not human but Heaven.\nAligning the Heaven within our body with the Heaven above,\nthe shifts of qi and number are as one with Heaven.\nIn cultivating the self, one can exhaust the spirits and know transformation—\nthis is the flourishing of virtue.\nIn divination, fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse are all foreknown.\nIn governing the state and pacifying the world,\nthe three hundred sixty offices of the *Rites of Zhou* correspond to the days, forming the months—\nthere is nothing that cannot be ordered.\nThe Master’s four ways of the sage are all present herein.\nAs for the two *Yijing* texts’ fifty thousand one thousand five hundred twenty words,\nthey correspond to the number of all things—\nthat is, the hairs, down, pores, and orifices of our body.\nAnd within them, the numbers of the ten thousand things of the world are complete.\nThe twelve earthly branches of a day sum a year’s *gen*—\nfour thousand five hundred twenty,\nand the two texts’ words again correspond to this.\nThe *Zihua Zi* states:\nAbove, it divides and completes Heaven;\nbelow, it unites and completes Earth.\nOnce divided, it is named the Center.\nDivision must unite with something—\nit is named Harmony.\nCenter, Mystery, Harmony, and Unity—\nthe ten thousand things are transformed and born.\nThis is what is called “three threes and six sixes,”\nthe four movements that complete the *Changes*,\nthe eighteen changes that form a hexagram.\nEight hexagrams make a lesser completion;\ndrawing them out, extending them by analogy,\nall the world’s capacities are exhausted.\nPushing and expanding them,\nthese are the numbers of Former Heaven.\nThus the Dao is made manifest through them,\nand virtue and conduct are made spirit-like.\nCan one respond to the world’s changes with them?\nCan one assist the divine luminaries?\nThe numinous all derive from the numbers of Heaven One and Earth Two,\nHeaven Three and Earth Four,\nHeaven Five and Earth Six,\nHeaven Seven and Earth Eight,\nHeaven Nine and Earth Ten.\nThe *Hemp-Clad Master* spoke of “Heaven One generating Water,”\nthe qi of *Kan* gestating within *Qian* Metal—\nthese all describe the formation of images.\nOnly when Heaven One and Earth Six unite is Water formed;\n*Qian* and *Kan* combine, and Water is completed in Metal—\nthese describe the formation of forms.\nThough the generating and completing numbers of the Five Phases\nmay be recited even by children,\ntheir meaning is such that even the old and strong do not grasp their import—\nthis is the intent of “accomplishing transformation and enacting the spirits’ workings.”\nThe *Hemp-Clad Master* understood this.\nThus the Master said:\n“One who knows the Dao of transformation—\ndoes he not know the spirits’ doings?”\nAnd again:\n“The *Changes* are without thought, without action,\nstill and unmoving,\nyet responsive and penetrating all the world’s affairs.”\nThe sage uses this to purify the heart,\nretiring and concealing it in secrecy.\nFortune and misfortune share the people’s breath;\nthe spirits know the future, knowledge conceals the past.\nSuch were the wise, perspicacious, and sagely of old—\ndivinely martial yet not slaying.\nThus it is said:\nNo image is greater than Heaven and Earth;\nno transformation is greater than the four seasons.\nNo suspended image is more luminous than the sun and moon;\nnothing is more exalted than nobility and wealth—\nall are but extensions of this.\nThus it is said:\n“Three Heavens and two Earths lean upon the numbers.”\nTest this with the fingers of the hands and feet:\nthe joints of the fingers are two Earths and three Heavens;\nthe joints of the toes are three Heavens and two Earths.\nThe five digits of each hand and foot—\nhere again the number five is manifest.\nThe *Wenyan* of *Qian* states:\n“The great person’s virtue accords with Heaven and Earth,\ntheir brightness with the sun and moon,\ntheir order with the four seasons,\ntheir fortune and misfortune with the spirits.\nPreceding Heaven, Heaven does not oppose them;\nfollowing Heaven, they comply with Heaven’s timing.\nHeaven itself does not oppose them—\nhow much less so humans? How much less the spirits?”\nIn the *Dayou* hexagram, only the fifth line is yin—\nthis too embodies the meaning of leaving five aside.\nAnd the top yang line of Heaven states:\n“From Heaven comes protection—\nauspicious, nothing not beneficial.”",
      "overlap_context": "rkings are enacted.\nGathering the primal chaos to form essence and qi,\nexhaling and inhaling to harmonize yin and yang,\nacting where there is no action—\nonly thus are transformations fulfilled.\nWisdom and foolishness arise from one nature;\ngood and evil stem from a single thought.\nWhere thought and consideration dwell,\nconsideration extends without limit—\nthis is how the spirits’ workings are enacted.\nThis is what is meant by *the Dao of one yin and one yang,*\nand *the spirits’ unfathomability.*",
