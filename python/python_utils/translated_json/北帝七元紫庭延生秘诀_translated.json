By the Wei period, Master Ye transmitted it to the world.\n\nThe Most High is formless and void; the true essence of the Northern Emperor ascends to the Purple Court.\n\n□Body.\n□Wealth.\n□Fortune and virtue for men and women.\n□Life.\n□Official rank.\n□□Longevity.\n□Wives, concubines, servants, and maidservants.\n\nFor the seven positions above, use seven bowls of lamps. Light them in a quiet chamber to observe their brightness or dimness, thereby discerning the calamities or dangers of each position.\n\nFor all rituals, perform them on the days of the new and full moons. The *Scripture of the Seven Primes* states: \"On these days, the Seven True Persons of the Northern Emperor descend to the mortal realm to inspect transgressions and blessings. If one performs the ritual to seek deliverance from disasters, all shall be auspicious and without misfortune.\"\n\nIt is fitting to choose the day of one’s life destiny, the day harmonizing with one’s official rank and destiny, or a day of mutual generation. At a place where dogs and rats do not reach, clear away grass and filth, and perform the rites on purified ground during the hours of *chou*, *hai*, or *wei*. This is called \"sweeping the ground for the ritual,\" and one may also use white cogon grass as a mat.\n\nIf one knows the names of the stars, the offerings they consume, and the places they traverse, one shall always attain victory in auspicious matters.\n\n**The following matters:**\n\nDuring the ritual, one must bathe and maintain purity. Arrange the lamps by position, placing a small table beneath each star with offerings upon it. Wash all items with water infused with cogon grass, and sprinkle the courtyard and chamber.\n\nTo the north of the sacrificial site, erect two markers with coins. When the coins upon the markers move, the true deities have arrived, and calamities shall be averted while blessings descend. However, one must not fix one’s gaze upon the sacred seat.\n\nIf one merely knows the name of the star governing one’s destiny, one shall be free from disaster—how much more so if one regularly performs the ritual.\n\nAfter the rite, observe from which direction the wind blows, for this is the direction for seeking fame.\n\nTake a small portion of the star’s offering, place it in a pouch roughly one *cun* square, and wear it upon the head when traveling. In times of urgent peril, call upon the name thrice, and the Star Lord of one’s life destiny shall come to one’s aid. For other matters, also invoke the Star Lord of one’s life destiny.\n\nUse pure wine, rare incense, refined tea, unblemished fruits, oil cakes, and coins—let the quantity be determined by the individual.\n\nPrepare a single sheet of plain paper listing the true positions and stating one’s intentions.\n\n1. **Yang Bright Star**, corresponding to the fifth and seventh stars.\n2. **Yin Essence Star**, corresponding to the fourth and sixth stars, aligned in a straight line.\n3. **True Person Star**, whose position does not shift.\n4. **Mystic Darkness Star**\n5. **Cinnabar Prime Star**\n6. **Northern Culmen Star**\n7. **Celestial Pass Star**, along with the **Auxiliary Star** and **Assisting Star**.\n\nAll the above wear jeweled crowns, are clad in misty robes, and hold jade tablets, appearing in the form of true persons. During the ritual, visualize them and offer prayers.\n\n8. **Emperor Star**, the Lofty Jade Emperor Radiant Lord—if one beholds him, one’s lifespan increases by three hundred years.\n9. **Venerable Star**, the Jade Emperor Spirit Lord of the Supreme Tenuity, also called the Supreme Emperor of the Seven Celestial Primes—if one beholds him, one’s lifespan increases by six hundred years.\n\nBoth are attired in imperial regalia and dwell near the Northern Dipper. One tradition holds that the Emperor resides within the fourth star and the Venerable One within the second, for both are the spirits of great imperial majesty. Visualize them during the ritual.\n\nRegularly, on the nights of the third and twenty-seventh days of each month, secretly await their presence, ensuring no one else witnesses them.\n\nWith sincere devotion over time, none shall fail to behold them. The two stars appear as large as the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, their light suffused with purple radiance—unlike any common celestial body, resplendent and awe-inspiring. Upon seeing them, prostrate and make your entreaties. Then, prostrate again to beseech long life and transcendence as a flying immortal, and present your heart’s desires. Once you have beheld them, the Two August Lords shall bestow upon you the rank of Perfected Official.\n\nThe Upper Terrace Star is named *Void Essence*; invoking it may summon dreams of emperors and kings, as well as gold and jade. Call upon its name, and your plea shall be answered. The Middle Terrace Star is named *Sixfold Purity*; invoking it brings flourishing official rank and emolument. Call upon its name, and your wish shall be fulfilled. The Lower Terrace Star is named *Crooked Life*; invoking it secures wives, concubines, and servants. Call upon its name, and your desire shall be granted.\n\nThe Supreme Tenuity Emperor Lord declares: To attain longevity, long life, wealth, and high promotion, one must cultivate this art. If one practices the stellar pacing and performs the ritual over time, it can absolve the sins of seven generations of ancestors and dispel one’s own calamities and misfortunes. Whatever adversities arise, they shall vanish upon invocation. Should an emperor seek the Dao, his lifespan shall equal that of the Three Luminaries, his transformations shall be boundless, and his blessings as vast as mountains. Those who diligently cultivate the Dao shall be deeply beloved; they shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight. The Three Dukes and high ministers shall receive auspicious dreams of imperial favor, and their official ranks shall prosper. In households of utmost purity where this method is practiced, all illnesses and inauspicious omens shall be averted.\n\nIn ancient times, Liu Jing of the Han was besieged by a million rebel soldiers, arrows raining down like a storm, his troops pale with fear. Yet Jing remained unshaken, his unlined robe draped loosely as he paced the steps of the Seven Stars and silently vowed to perform the ritual. Suddenly, divine beings appeared to break the siege, and the rebels scattered in flight. This was but the common method of pacing and ritual—how much more potent, then, are these secret and true oral transmissions from the Perfected Immortals? According to the *Seven Primes Canon*, this teaching is passed to but one person every hundred years, and only to those whose destiny is recorded in the celestial registers. To transmit it recklessly invites calamity upon nine generations of ancestors.\n\nFor those who cannot yet pace the stellar steps, performing the ritual twice a month shall still yield responses. After one year, all untimely misfortunes shall be averted; after two years, all military disasters; after three years, all fatal calamities; and after four years, one shall behold the true forms of the deities. A thousand disasters and ten thousand evils shall be powerless to assail you, and you shall forever be free from harm.\n\n1. **Yang Brightness Star**: Those born in the *zi* hour belong to it; they should consume glutinous millet.\n2. **Yin Essence Star**: Those born in the *chou* or *hai* hours belong to it; they should consume foxtail millet.\n3. **Perfected Person Star**: Those born in the *yin* or *xu* hours belong to it; they should consume glutinous rice.\n4. **Mysterious Darkness Star**: Those born in the *mao* or *you* hours belong to it; they should consume adzuki beans.\n5. **Cinnabar Prime Star**: Those born in the *chen* or *shen* hours belong to it; they should consume sesame seeds.\n6. **North Culmen Star**: Those born in the *si* or *wei* hours belong to it; they should consume soybeans.\n7. **Celestial Pass Star**: Those born in the *wu* hour belong to it; they should consume adzuki beans.\n\n**Ritual Offerings Canon**:\nSubstitute effigies: twelve figures per person.\n\n**Ritual Offerings**:\nPolished white rice.\nOne bolt of life-bestowing silk.\nOne pair of body-adhering garments.\nOne life-bestowing cloth, twelve feet in length.\nOne pair of gold rings.\nOne pair of jade rings.\nOne *dou* and two *sheng* of salt.\nOne *shi* and two *dou* of official’s rice.\nOne thousand two hundred copper coins.\nOne *dou* and two *sheng* of fermented beans.\nOne hundred twenty sheets of memorial paper.\nOne brush.\nOne stick of ink.\nAn incense burner.\nA pure-water table.\n**Pledges of Faith in Colored Silks**:\nFor the East: nine bolts and nine feet of azure silk.\nFor the South: three bolts and three feet of crimson silk.\nFor the West: seven bolts and seven feet of white silk.\nFor the North: five bolts and five feet of black silk.\nFor the Center: twelve bolts and two feet of yellow silk.\n**Fruits**: chestnuts, plums, peaches, jujubes, apricots, walnuts, dried persimmons, and pears—whatever is consumed.\nTwo pure beds: one placed against the northern wall, facing south, upon which the *Seven Primes Diagram* is set. The diagram is made of two panels of azure silk, each nine feet long, and painted accordingly.\n\nWhen performing the ritual, after burning incense, present wine and food. Once all is complete, withdraw.\n\nAfter a long moment of focused meditation, hold the ritual tablet and bow deeply, standing five feet apart.\n\nSoftly intone the invocation:\n*\"On this day, the [day] of the [month] in the [year], at the [hour], your disciple, bearing the title [rank], born under the star of [name], prostrates and bows twice in reverence.*\n\n*We humbly beseech the Seven Primes True Lords, radiant with yang brightness and yin essence, resplendent in glory, to descend this night and partake of these modest offerings. Temporarily alight from the celestial court, bestow upon your servant fearlessness, peace for body and soul, erase my name from the ledger of death, and inscribe me for eternal life. May all I seek be attained, all I undertake be fulfilled. Above, move the hearts of emperors; below, sway the sentiments of the people. May all revere and cherish me, and may I ascend to the Purple Court. Descend now to this ritual altar—we prostrate and bow twice in reverence.*\n\n*We humbly beseech the Seven Primes True Lords, the True Person of the Mysterious Darkness, to descend to this purified altar and accept this humble offering. Know the sincerity of my cinnabar heart, and grant my wish to ascend to the Immortal Capital. May the Nameless of the Great Yin command the myriad spirits, the Six Jia and Six Ding, to move the heart of Heaven above and save the mortal realm below. Descend now to this ritual altar—we prostrate and bow twice in reverence.*\n\n*We humbly beseech the Seven Primes True Lords, the Cinnabar Prime of the Northern Culmen, to descend to this purified altar, strike my name from the rolls of death, and grant me the power of the Dao. May my lifespan equal the Three Luminaries, my blessings number in the tens of thousands. May divine beings guard my body, and jade maidens attend me. Descend now to this ritual altar—we prostrate and bow twice in reverence.*\n\n*We humbly beseech the Seven Primes True Lords, the Great Divinity of the Celestial Pass, to illuminate your servant’s body. Grant me eternal life, that I may become a guest of the Emperor. May my countenance shine like the sun and moon, my spring endure through all four seasons. May the filth of the lower realms swiftly ascend to the ranks of the Perfected. Gaze left upon Yu Yi, clasp right the Hand of Jie Lin. May jade lads serve as my messengers, jade maidens as my kin. Descend now to this ritual altar—we prostrate and bow twice in reverence.*\n\n*Facing the Dipper’s Mouth, we humbly beseech the Two Venerable Stars of the Northern Culmen, whose numinous power none have seen—yet to see them is to attain eternal life. Inscribe me for flight to immortality, strike my name from the ledger of death. May boundless blessings and fortune align with Heaven’s will. May I swiftly transcend to the Immortal Capital and wander the Upper Clarity. Descend now to this ritual altar—we prostrate and bow twice in reverence.*\n\n*We humbly beseech the Assistant and Attendant True Lords, one concealed and one revealed, most true and most divine, who aid and encircle the Northern Culmen, permeating the Purple Court. Bestow the power of the Dao to fulfill my karmic causes. Above, uphold the will of Heaven; below, ferry the lost across the ford. Descend now to this ritual altar—we prostrate and bow twice in reverence.*\n\n*Facing the western seat, we humbly beseech the Upper Terrace’s Void Essence, the Middle Terrace’s Sixfold Purity, and the Lower Terrace’s Curved Life. Your humble servant prostrates and entreats again in reverence. Though my offerings are modest, my devotion is not slight. I pour forth my heart and exhaust my strength. Know the sincerity of my cinnabar heart. Erase my name from the ledger of death, inscribe me for eternal life. May my rank ascend, my office listed in the celestial court. May my mind be expansive, my ears and eyes keen. May my Three Hun endure forever, my Seven Po never falter. Above, may I ascend to the Golden Gates; below, pay homage at the Jade Capital. May I ride the cloud-dragon, take my place as an immortal minister. Descend now to this ritual altar—we prostrate and bow twice in reverence.\"*\n\nWhen all is complete, withdraw. The Perfected may then partake of the offerings.\nIf there is a personal petition, present it at this time.\n\nThe proclamation of memorials must not be done in a loud voice, nor should it be seen or known by miscellaneous persons.\n\nFor the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, arrange three altars beneath the handle of the Dipper. For the local earth god and the spirit of the day, burn paper money in advance as offerings to ensure the transmission of petitions and the dispelling of impurities.\n\n**Memorial Text**\nOn such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, [name and place of origin] respectfully proclaims to the Northern Culmen Divine Palace and the Seven True Lords of the Northern Dipper:\n\n[Here follows the text of the petition.]\n\nThis memorial is humbly presented, daring to offend the Northern Culmen and slight the radiant deities, for which I tremble with profound awe. Humbly presented.\n\n**Morning and Evening Invocations**\nRespectfully invoke the Seven True Lords of the Northern Dipper: Yang Brightness, Yin Essence, True Person of Mystery, Cinnabar Prime of the Northern Culmen, and the numinous power of the Celestial Pass.\nErase my name from the ledger of death, inscribe me for eternal life. May all I seek be attained, all I do be accomplished. May all people hold me in esteem, and may I ascend to the Purple Court.\n\nNext, invoke the Two Venerable Stars of the Northern Culmen:\nMay I soon behold them, and upon beholding, attain eternal life. May boundless fortune and blessings be mine, and may my years equal those of heaven.\n\nNext, invoke the Three Terraces—by their true names: Utmost Sincerity, Void Essence, Sixfold Purity, and Crooked Life:\nMay my rank ascend, my office listed in the celestial court. May my mind be expansive, my ears and eyes keen. May my Three Hun endure forever, my Seven Po never falter.\n\n**Northern Dipper Longevity Invocation for Pacifying the Spirit and Prolonging Life**\nNorthern Dipper Seven Primes, Seven Numinous Jade Perfected:\nGreedy Wolf and Great Gate, preserve my long existence.\nSalary Star and Literary Curve, guard my living soul.\nIntegrity Star and Martial Curve, defend my life’s gate.\nBreaking Army and Assisting Ministers, secure my eternal life.\nDispel calamities, eradicate malevolent spirits.\nStrike my name from the ledger of death, inscribe it in the register of life.\nFree me from the Three Disasters, sever the Nine Adversities.\nLet the Perfected subdue ghosts, let all demons be overthrown.\nIn cultivating the Dao and refining the True, may I swiftly attain perfection.\nWith the Seven Primes as my guardians, may my body ascend to the Purple Court.\n\nBefore rising from bed and upon retiring, silently recite this invocation twice daily to pacify the spirit and ward off misfortune. Only then descend from bed or lie down.\n\n**Invocation:**\nBy the taboo name of Greedy Wolf, the Yang Brightness Star,\nBy the august deities of the Jade Emperor, ten thousand soldiers come to aid my body.\nBy the taboo name of Great Gate, the Yin Essence Star.\nBy the True Person of Salary Star, the Mystery of Literary Curve.\nBy the Cinnabar Prime of Integrity Star, the taboo name of Martial Curve, the Northern Culmen Star.\nBy the taboo name of Breaking Army, the Celestial Pass Star.\nThe Seven Venerable Perfected, thousands upon thousands, stand at my left and right.\nTo my left, the Azure Dragon; to my right, the White Tiger.\nBefore me, the Vermilion Bird; behind me, the Dark Warrior.\nBearing banners and standards, they surround me in countless ranks.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.\n\nThis method, when practiced by kings and lords, brings submission from barbarians and Chinese alike, prosperity to the people, and long life with enduring vision, equal in brilliance to heaven. When cultivated by Daoists, it leads to ascension; when practiced by laypersons, it prolongs life. Guard it in secrecy and do not treat it lightly.\n\n**Northern Emperor’s Seven Primes True Forms**—wear or carry them to amass great fortune and blessings:\nTrue Form of the First Star of the Northern Dipper: Yang Brightness\nTrue Form of the Second Star of the Northern Dipper: Yin Essence\nTrue Form of the Third Star of the Northern Dipper: True Person\nTrue Form of the Fourth Star of the Northern Dipper: Mystery\nTrue Form of the Fifth Star of the Northern Dipper: Cinnabar Prime\nTrue Form of the Sixth Star of the Northern Dipper: Northern Culmen\nTrue Form of the Seventh Star of the Northern Dipper: Celestial Pass\n\nHere concludes the *Northern Emperor’s Seven Primes Purple Court Longevity Secret Method*.",
