  "full_translation": "**Ritual of the Longevity Lamp for One’s Life Star in the Northern Dipper**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Ritual of the Longevity Lamp for One’s Life Star in the Northern Dipper*. One fascicle.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Weiyi* Category.\n\n---\n\n**Ritual of the Longevity Lamp for One’s Life Star in the Northern Dipper**\n\nThe ritual proceeds according to form.\n\nWe humbly observe: the primordial net manifests its image, thus establishing the statutes of the celestial realm; the *qi* of the Brahmā heavens traverses the sky, hence the governance of the life stars. In one year, they encircle six degrees; in three *jia* cycles, they pass through the nine palaces. They govern the myriad spirits of the earth below, turning misfortune to fortune; they align with the celestial luminaries above, resolving adversity into prosperity. Their responsiveness is boundless, and no darkness escapes their illumination.\n\nToday, in offering these lamps, the disciple [Name] reverently follows the sagely teachings and remotely invokes the true offices. The flickering flames of the purple phoenix lamps ascend to the Jade Dipper; the blazing radiance of the red lotus lamps illuminates the Golden Balance. We humbly pray that the Supreme Ultimate bestow auspiciousness, the Southern Palace record life, preserving longevity in boundless years and bestowing blessings without end.\n\nBowing in reverence, we devote ourselves and chant in praise:\n**Venerable Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life Preservation.**\n\nWe, the assembled, with sincere hearts, take refuge in [Name]’s Life Star Lord and all the spirit officials.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge: though the true mirror is not distant, it secretly responds to the most earnest prayers; though the celestial steps are far, they may be approached with fragrant offerings. We look up to the deities of the Perfect Ultimate, beseeching their pure blessings.\n\nToday, in kindling these lamps, the disciple [Name] collects the mind in inward reflection, devoting intent to the true wind. Considering the karmic records of past lives still lingering, this life’s fate remains obstructed. Seeking deliverance and encountering the luminous statutes, we kindle the lamp of the life star to cleanse the transgressions of the bodily palace.\n\nWe humbly pray: may the ledgers of the Dipper’s office be expunged, and our names inscribed among the immortals of the Southern Culmen. May the flowing calamities of retribution be transformed into auspicious fortune; may the adversities of misfortune and hardship be transmuted into glory.\n\nBowing in reverence, we devote ourselves and chant in praise:\n**Venerable Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life Preservation.**\n\nThe Jade True Lord, the Venerable Deity of the Purple Tenuity.\nAdorned in embroidered feathered robes, crimson and azure skirts.\nTwin pearls radiate brilliance, splendid lamps arrayed in display.\nDivine light illumines all, and a hundred blessings renew.\nThe proclamations of the Eight Mighties reach even the unseen.\nWith sincere hearts, we take refuge, praying for long life.\n\nWe, the assembled, with sincere hearts, take refuge in [Name]’s Life Star Lord and all the spirit officials.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge: the wondrous unity of the Great Void is fundamentally formless in its subtle function; the luminous statutes of the immortal registers manifest through devoted cultivation. The sacred precincts of the true court are the morning abode of the Jade Emperor. We look up to the immortal banners, sweeping clean the jade pavilions, serving the supreme lords of the primal destiny and extending the true spirits of life-*qi*.\n\nToday, in kindling these lamps, the disciple [Name] cultivates virtue and examines the self, rousing the heart to repentance, devoutly performing the jiao rites, and preparing pure offerings.\n\nWe humbly pray: may the Three Powers harmonize, and the myriad *qi* unite in transcendence; may the entire household long enjoy prosperity, and all our lives attain abundant protection. May the soul and spirit be purified, evil *qi* kept at bay, wealth and emolument flourish, and the foundation of fortune endure.\n\nBowing in reverence, we devote ourselves and chant in praise:\n**Venerable Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and Longevity.**\n\nThe Jade Capital towers in majesty, its vermilion gates flung wide.\nWithin resides the august personage, overseeing the celestial steps.\nClad in purple embroidered feathered robes, crowned with a golden kerchief.\nMaster of life’s registers, sealing mountains and summoning clouds.\nWhen petitions are made, divine might and mighty soldiers respond.\nWith sincere hearts, we take refuge, praying for long life.\n\nWe, the assembled, with sincere hearts, take refuge in [Name]’s Life Star Lord of the Year Star and all the spirit officials.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge: the Supreme Ultimate’s jade chart unfolds the primordial model of the Jade Capital; the Eastern Florescence’s precious register proclaims the grand design of the Golden Gates. The verdant canopy of the circular net shades the ten peaks of the celestial summit; the lush jade terraces gaze upon the ninefold azure heights of the empty sky. Thus, the flowing light unfolds, and the transformative work begins at the Celestial Pivot; the wondrous *qi* revolves, and the yearly cycle returns to the Winnowing Basket and Northern Dipper. Though noble and base depend on past blessings, lifespan is necessarily recorded at the year star.\n\nToday, in kindling these lamps, the disciple [Name] looks up to the mysterious offices of the supreme realm, turning toward the wondrous Dao of true constancy, arranging the positions according to the celestial stars, and igniting the crimson torches to transmit their light.\n\nWe humbly pray: may the Dao unite with nature, the heart follow intent, offering the protection of the sagely and true, and looking up to the descending auspices of the celestial writ.\n\nBowing in reverence, we devote ourselves and chant in praise:\n**Venerable Heavenly Worthy of Disaster Dispelling and Calamity Averting.**\n\nThe True August One of the Great Unity, the Purple Lord of the Middle Prime.\nHis name is *Guīyīng*, his style *Níwán*.\nSeated upon a golden couch, draped in purple embroidered skirts.\nGirded with fire bells, he slays demons and destroys treachery.\nIn hand, he grasps the essence of stars; upon his neck, the white circle rests.\nWith one heart, we take refuge, praying for long life.\n\nWe, the assembled, with sincere hearts, take refuge in [Name]’s Life Star Lord of the Year Star and all the spirit officials.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge: the cloud-patterned celestial weft spreads its radiance through the clear empyrean; the jade shadows and golden circles array the directions in the Purple Han. Since the Two Modes first divided, luminous effulgences soared into the high void; the Five *Qi*’s primordial offices arrayed the host of lights in the empty firmament. Yet the changes of flowing and counterflowing give rise to the anxieties of fortune and misfortune. If the life palace is traversed by the oblique, transgressions and faults arise in the bodily position.\n\nToday, in igniting these lamps, the disciple [Name] considers the illumination beneath the stars and initiates a fragrant prayer to the primordial offices.\n\nWe humbly pray: may the auspicious luminaries descend in high attendance, preserving the great cedar’s lifespan; may the baleful stars retreat, and we forever receive the glory of radiant splendor.\n\nBowing in reverence, we devote ourselves and chant in praise:\n**Venerable Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life Preservation.**\n\nThe Radiant Spirit of Great Brilliance, ninefold layered in verdant splendor.\nMorning auroras scatter their radiance, refining the fivefold forms.\nThe palace chariot traverses the six directions, the seven spirits harmonized.\nEnabling us to ascend as flying immortals, ascending to the Upper Clarity.\nWhen merit is complete and the Dao attained, the Three Primes come to welcome.\nWith one heart, we take refuge, praying for long life.\n\nWe, the assembled, with sincere hearts, take refuge in [Name]’s Life Star Lord of the Year Star and all the spirit palaces.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge: at the inception of the primordial beginning, the foundation of the blue-green revolution was laid...\n\nAt the inception of creation’s authority, the era of Red Clarity was established in succession.\nThe great surge of revolving qi governs the cosmos, ordering the world’s expanse—\ntruly guiding the people’s lives, and presiding over fortune and misfortune.\n\nOn this day of kindling the lamps, disciple [Name], bowing at the Dipper’s apex to fulfill destiny,\ndevotes heart and soul to the true teaching, offering fragrant orchid essences,\narranging silver lamps with violet flames.\n\nWe humbly pray: may the Five Fortunes flourish and abound,\nmay the Ninefold Purity grant its protection.\nMay we tread the path of peace and prosperity,\nand dwell long in the realm of tranquility.\n\nWith reverence, we devote ourselves and chant in praise:\n**Venerable Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Blessings.**\n\nThe Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens, primordial yang essence.\nThe august Elder Venerable Spirit, clad in feathered azure.\nEnthroned in the celestial palace, resplendent as the Year Star.\nScattering radiance and flowing fragrance, purifying and nourishing our forms.\nThe Five Qi merge in harmony, heaven and earth enduring as one.\n\nWith one heart, we take refuge, praying for long life.\n\nRecitation of scriptures, proclamation of petitions—henceforth, the dedication:\n**The Rite of the Dipper’s Life-Prolonging Lamps is now complete.**",
