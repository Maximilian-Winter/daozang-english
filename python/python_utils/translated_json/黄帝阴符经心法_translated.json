  "full_translation": "**The Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* Heart Method**\n\n**Title:** The Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* Heart Method.\nComposed by Xu Yuan Yi, likely from the Jin-Yuan period.\nThree volumes.\nSource: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Canon of Orthodox Daoist Scripture), *Tongzhen* (Venerable Perfection) Section, *Yu Jue* (Jade Precepts) Category.\n\n**Volume One: The Heart Method of the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing*\nAnnotated by Xu Yuan Yi, a recluse from Shu’s Tongchuan, Six Emptiness Mountain**\n\n**Chapter: Revealing the Dao of Heaven**\n\nThe *Jing* states:\n*\"To observe the Dao of Heaven, to grasp its movements—this is sufficient.\nIf you wish to create the *Yin Fu* Dao, focus your efforts on the character ‘observe’ (观),\nand do not contrive other interpretations. Concentrate fiercely and keenly.\nSilently observe within, and suddenly you will perceive.\nMy own silent observation—even the sages of past and future, with their mouths sealed and tongues bound,\ncould not describe the learning of the *Yin Fu Jing*—it is complete.\"*\n\nShould one not yet attain this, let them examine the following text:\nWhy?\n*Observe* (观) means *to see* (视), *to examine* (察).\n*Heaven* (天) refers to *Nature* (自然).\n*Dao* (道) means *principle* (理).\n*Grasp* (执) means *to hold* (持).\n*Movement* (行) means *to practice* (践履).\n\nIt states that those who study the Dao must observe and examine the natural principles of Heaven’s Dao,\nto understand their own inherent nature.\nThose who attain this must hold it in daily life, practicing it with pure mastery,\nso that not even for a moment do they depart from it.\n\nThe intent of the *Yin Fu Jing* is profound, complete, and cannot be surpassed.\nThis is the overarching principle of the text,\nwhich is fully elaborated in the following passages.\n\nHeaven has **Five Thieves** (五贼)—those who perceive them thrive.\nThe Dao of Heaven is but **One Qi** (一气),\nyet its transformations manifest as the **Five Phases** (五行).\nIt is not called the **Five Phases** but the **Five Thieves**,\nfor they embody Heaven’s Dao—unseen when viewed, unheard when listened to.\nThey operate between **Yin and Yang** (两仪),\nshifting cold and heat, evolving past and future,\ngenerating and transforming all things,\never advancing while abandoning nothing—who could fathom this?\nThus it says: *Heaven has Five Thieves.*\nTo *see* (见) is to *understand* (明),\nto *thrive* (昌) is to *flourish* (盛).\n\nIt means that observing Heaven’s Dao in its **One Qi**,\none perceives the **Five Phases** in their transformations;\napplying one’s own Dao in its **One Nature**,\none manifests the **Five Virtues** (五常) in their functions.\n\nThe **Five Virtues** (五常) are also formless and soundless,\nneither Yin nor Yang,\nyet they embody benevolence and righteousness,\nexcel in both flexibility and firmness,\nentering and exiting without fixed time,\nknown to no one in their origin.\nThose who understand—\ntheir **virtue** (德) of the Five Virtues shines ever more brilliant.\nThus it says: *Those who perceive them thrive.*\n\nThe **Five Thieves** reside in the heart,\nand their actions extend to Heaven.\nThe **Five Thieves** are the Dao of Heaven.\n*Reside in the heart* means that Heaven’s Dao dwells within the human heart.\nIf Heaven’s Dao resides in the heart,\nthen the heart itself is the Dao—how profound this statement!\n\nThe **Five Thieves** reside in the heart,\nfor fear that later generations,\nstudying the observation of Heaven’s Five Thieves,\nwould seek them only in Heaven’s Heaven (天之天),\nand fail to recognize that they must be sought in the Heaven of the heart (心之天).\n\nSuch words are piercing—\nthey urge one to exert effort in revealing the true nature of humanity.\n\nIf a person devotes all their strength to the **Five Thieves** residing in the heart,\nand directly assumes responsibility for them,\nas Zengzi did when he heard the Dao—*one thread runs through all*—\nand declared: *\"Beyond this ‘one thread,’ there are no other doubts.\"*\nTo grasp Confucius’ intent—\nis this not exhilarating?\n\nShould one not yet attain this,\nthey must focus entirely on the **Five Thieves** residing in the heart,\nconcentrating deeply and savoring its meaning,\nuntil they gain some insight,\nand then they will know that daily life is\nnothing but the manifestation of my heart’s Heaven,\nfree from all external interference—\nis this not the same as applying it to Heaven?\n\nThe *Inner Observation Jing* (《内观经》) states:\n*\"The Sage teaches people to cultivate the Dao—this is to cultivate the heart.\nTo teach people to cultivate the heart—this is to cultivate the Dao.\nOnly the word ‘cultivate’ (修) differs.\"*\n\nMencius said:\n*\"To exhaust one’s heart is to know one’s nature,\nand to know one’s nature is to know Heaven.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s words are so simple yet direct,\nso clear and unadulterated—\nwhy should scholars harbor any doubts?\n\nThe universe lies within one’s grasp,\nand all transformations arise from the body.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* (《通玄经》) states:\n*\"The four directions and the four extremes—this is the realm of *space* (宇).\nThe past and the future—this is the realm of *time* (宙).\nAll *transformations* (万化) are the endless changes of all things.\n*Grasp* (手) and *body* (身) refer to oneself.\"*\n\nIf a person truly attains the **Five Thieves** residing in the heart,\nand believes in it with conviction while understanding it thoroughly,\nthen even the vastness of the four directions and four extremes,\nthe boundless span of past and future,\nand the infinite transformations of all things—\nall flow from their own heart,\nand they need not rely on others.\nThus Mencius said:\n*\"All things are complete within me.\nTo return to sincerity within oneself—\nno greater joy exists.\"*\n\n**Heaven’s nature is humanity** (天性，人也).\n**The human heart is the mechanism** (人心，机也).\nHumans are born in stillness—\nthis is the nature of Heaven.\nThus it says: *Heaven’s nature is humanity.*\n\nWhen nature departs from stillness,\nit becomes movement and is called **heart** (心).\nThe heart is the sovereign of the body,\nthe essential mechanism of all transformations.\nThus it says: *The human heart is the mechanism.*\n\nThe *Great Harmony Jing* (《大通经》) states:\n*\"Stillness is called nature (性),\nyet the heart (心) is within it;\nMovement is called heart,\nyet nature is within it.\"*\n\nThe character **nature** (性) must not be merely taken as ink on paper—\none must reflect inwardly and verify it,\nuntil they truly grasp its meaning,\nand then their study will not be in vain.\nIf so, they will return to the origin and restore the fundamental,\ntranscend the mundane and enter the Sagehood—\nis this not a reality?\n\nOtherwise, mechanical cleverness and worldly cunning accumulate in the heart,\nclashing and wearing against external things,\nslipping away from Heaven’s nature,\nand degenerating into the delusions of the secular world—\nmaking daily life oblivious,\nas distant as Heaven and Earth—\nwhose fault is this?\n\nEstablish the Dao of Heaven,\nand thereby settle humanity.\n*Establish* (立) means *upright and unyielding* (刚正不倚).\nThe Dao of Heaven is the Dao of Heaven’s nature.\n*Settle* (定) means *to tranquilize* (镇静).\nHumanity refers to the heart of human desires (人欲).\n\nThe Dao of Heaven’s nature—\nwhen studied to the point of *boundless clarity without self*,\nwhat room remains for human desires?\nBefore reaching this stage,\none must exert effort and maintain it,\nstrengthening it with uprightness and unyielding resolve,\nto be the master of one’s body.\nTranquilizing the heart of human desires,\npreventing it from sprouting,\nthen the nine orifices and four limbs will not act recklessly,\nand the body’s inner and outer will all find peace.*\"\n\nThus it is said: *Establish* the Dao of Heaven to *tranquilize* humanity. If one’s nature lacks the upright and unyielding substance, weak and unable to stand firm, then at the slightest movement, it yields to private human desires, indulging in licentiousness and extravagance, with no limit to its excesses. Such a one who seeks tranquility in the world—there has never been one.\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes its killing intent, dragons and serpents rise from the earth. When humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth are overturned.\n*Killing* here means *threatening power*. *Dragons and serpents* refer to the greatest of hidden forces. *Rising from the earth* means emerging from concealment. *Overturned* means *preverted*.\n\nHeaven’s threatening power is the thunder and lightning. When the time is for stillness, it conceals its intent, silent and unseen, hidden from all. When the time is for action, it responds in due season, without private motive or desire, its roar shaking all things, awakening the hidden and the dormant, freeing them from obscurity, allowing them to flourish and flow freely—all creatures benefit from its grace.\n\nHumanity’s threatening power is the subtle operation of the mind and spirit. Before its manifestation, it aligns with Heaven in perfect unity, imperceptible even to ghosts and spirits, let alone humans. When external things stir sensation, private desires arise, corrupting the purity of Heaven’s principle, unleashing the venom of tigers and wolves. Humanity suffers harm, and all things are disturbed. Hence the Sage laments:\n\n*\"When humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth are overturned\"*—meaning, how can the movement of the human heart be so utterly inverted from the Dao of Heaven and Earth?\n\nWhen Heaven and humanity act in harmony, the foundation of ten thousand transformations is set.\n*Heaven* refers to the Dao of Heaven. *Humanity* refers to the human heart. *Set* means *unshaken*. *Foundation* means *root*.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven responds in due season, without private motive or desire, and all things receive its grace. When humanity, in responding to affairs and engaging with things, governs itself with the same lack of private motive or desire, then Heaven and humanity act in perfect harmony.\n\nIf this is so, then when matters and things arise, they come like guests in a lofty hall—though they bring a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, they are met with discernment and without evasion. The still, round, and luminous root, unmoved, is never disturbed.\n\nYet if even a hair’s breadth of desire lingers within, then humanity unleashes its killing intent—how can this align with the foundation of ten thousand transformations?\n\nNature has skill and clumsiness, which can be concealed. The original, pure nature, still and undisturbed, is serene as the boundless void—how can there be skill or clumsiness?\n\nThe *Classic* says: *\"Nature has skill and clumsiness\"*—meaning the nature shaped by habit. One whose habit-formed nature is skilled in letters and numbers will be clumsy in archery and charioteering; one skilled in pottery will be unable to measure with the plumb and square.\n\nThus the Sage admonished: *\"It can be concealed.\"* *Concealed* means *not to display oneself*. If one displays oneself, then one’s abilities will surely be flaunted in arrogance, and one’s deficiencies will surely be sought in desperation. Arrogance leads to the loss of virtue, desperation wastes one’s true essence—both are delusions. Yet with the serene, pure nature, responding and flowing naturally, one nearly attains the Dao.\n\nThe nine orifices’ corruption lies in the three gateways, which can be controlled in stillness and motion. The human body, from head to foot, possesses nine orifices through which the virtue of spirit and intelligence flows—like the doors and windows of a dwelling. The three that govern life and death, order and chaos, are the ears, eyes, and mouth.\n\nThe ears hear sounds, the eyes see colors, the mouth speaks and argues—thus stirring the heart, sprouting desires, yielding to emotions, and losing one’s nature. Then the nine orifices become corrupt.\n\nYet, is it not natural for the ears to hear? For the eyes to see? For the mouth to speak? If one says no, humanity is not wood or stone—how could it not be so?\n\nThus the *Classic* says: *\"They can be controlled in stillness and motion.\"* *Controlled in stillness and motion* means teaching later learners that when these three gateways are stirred by sensation, one must discern what can be heard and heard, what can be seen and seen, what can be spoken and spoken. What cannot be heard, do not hear. What cannot be seen, do not see. What cannot be spoken, do not speak.\n\nIf this is so, then the corruption of the nine orifices will have no cause to arise, and the use of the three gateways can be controlled in stillness and motion.\n\nConfucius said: *\"Do not look at what is not proper, do not listen to what is not proper, do not speak of what is not proper, do not act on what is not proper—this is all.\"*\n\nFire arises from wood; when disaster strikes, it is certain to prevail. Treachery arises in the state; when it moves, it is certain to collapse. To know this and refine oneself—this is the Sage.\n\nWood giving rise to fire: fire blazes and wood is consumed. Treachery arising in the state: treachery flourishes and the state falls—this is the natural order.\n\nHumanity’s origin is such: if the pure nature remains serene and tranquil, merging with Heaven’s principle, then when the ears and eyes open to the external, and desires and aversions arise within, emotions separate from nature, *qi* scatters and essence is lost—before reaching Heaven’s allotted span, one meets premature death and ruin. How is this different from wood giving rise to fire, or treachery arising in the state?\n\nThe Sage transmitted this teaching, intending that later learners observe this, discard emotions and desires, cherish *qi* and economize spirit, remain still and without action, unwavering morning and evening. Such cultivation, such refinement—until the practice is perfected, there is sudden enlightenment to true nature, returning to the root and origin, transcending the mundane and entering sainthood—the Dao of the Sage.\n\nThus it is said: *To know this and refine oneself*—this is the Sage.\n\n*The Heart Method of the Yellow Emperor’s Secret of the Dark* concludes here.\n*The Heart Method of the Yellow Emperor’s Secret of the Dark* continues.\n\n「Shù Tóngchuān’s *Six Emptiness Scattered Man* Xū Yuán-yī’s Annotation\nOpens the *Chapter on Nurturing Life*\n\nHeaven’s birth and death are the Dao’s natural order.\nHeaven is the Way of effortless spontaneity.\nDoes it harbor intentions toward life and death?\nRather, the arising of things and their demise—\nwhen their time comes, it is natural.\n\nThus, one birth and one death,\nspring and autumn alternating,\npast and present flowing—\nthis is the constant principle of Heaven’s Dao.\n\nMan’s life is but one thing among all things,\nand the principle of life and death—what makes it different from other things?\n\nTo know this, why rejoice in life?\nWhy dread death?\nLeave it to its own course,\nand with boundless ease, attain great tranquility—\nthis is the proper way to nurture life.\n\nIf one does this,\none may delight in the Dao’s constant harmony\nand roam beyond the confines of life and death.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the *thieves* of all things;\nAll things are the *thieves* of man;\nMan is the *thief* of all things.\nHeaven and Earth are the parents of all things—\nchildren arise from the *qi* of their parents.\nHence it is said: *Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things.*\n\nThings steal from Heaven and Earth to be born,\nplundering dew and rain to grow,\neach fulfilling its own nature’s portion—\nwhen they reach maturity and completion,\nthey are all fully realized.\n\nAll things steal from Heaven and Earth in this way.\nMan’s life requires first the act of nurturing.\nThe essentials of nurturing:\nnobles and commoners, rich and poor—\neach should find contentment in their allotted fate.\nSteal from all things to nourish life,\nlike how all things rely on dew and rain—\njust enough is sufficient.\n\nDo not indulge in desires beyond one’s portion,\nthen internally nothing is lost,\nexternally nothing disturbs—\nbody and mind at peace,\n*qi* and blood in harmonious flow,\nattaining Heaven’s full span,\nwithout dying prematurely.\n\nOne may thus ascend to the marvels of deep-rooted stability,\nlong life, and enduring vision—\nfar beyond mere physical sustenance!\n\nIf one defies fate and exceeds one’s portion,\nindulges in desires and gluttony,\nexhausts the spirit without rest—\nis this not like using the *Huìhóu’s pearl* to hunt a single yellow sparrow?\n*Absurd!*\n\n*The Scripture on Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancients who delighted in the Dao\nate just enough to fill their emptiness and sustain their *qi*,\nclothed themselves just enough to cover their form and ward off cold—\nthey did not covet gain or hoard excess.\nThey kept their eyes clear without seeing,\nears still without hearing,\nmouth closed without speaking,\nmind surrendered without deliberating.\nThey found no joy, no suffering,\nno preference, no aversion—\nall things were mysteriously unified,\nneither this nor that.\n\nThe three *thieves* were thus in accord,\nthe three *talents* were thus at peace.\n*In accord* means:\nHeaven and Earth delight in nurturing all things,\nall things delight in completing, thriving, and multiplying,\nman delights in contentment and moderation—\nif the three find harmony in their accord,\nthen the three *talents* all attain their natural ease.\n\nIf Heaven does not rain in due time,\nif Earth does not give birth to things,\nthen Heaven and Earth are *not in accord*.\nIf grains and crops do not bear fruit,\nif eggs and offspring are not produced,\nthen all things are *not in accord*.\nIf one defies fate and exceeds one’s portion,\nindulges in desires and greed,\ninternally disturbs the spirit and *qi*,\nexternally harms the body’s harmony,\nthen human nature is *not in accord*.\n\nLearners must take what is proper,\ndiscard what is improper—\ninternally attaining a tranquil mind,\nexternally attaining harmony in human affairs,\nall things flourishing and multiplying,\ncalamities and misfortunes not arising—\nthus delighting in the governance of great peace.\n\nHence it is said:\n*Eat in season, and the hundred limbs will be in order.*\n*Stir the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations will be at peace.*\n\nFood is what nourishes the body,\nand its value lies in eating in season—\nthen the five *zàng* organs are fully harmonized,\nthe hundred limbs healthy and strong,\ndelighting in the emotions of life’s vitality,\nneither deficiency nor excess will bring illness.\n\nThis concludes the discussion of the three *thieves*’ accord\nand elaborates on the meaning of *stirring the mechanism*.\n\nWhen a man’s mind is still and undisturbed,\nclear as the boundless void,\nwhat is there to speak of as a *mechanism*?\n\nThe moment an intention arises,\nbefore it manifests outwardly—\nthis is what others do not know,\nbut I alone perceive—\nand this I call the *mechanism*.\n\nMan’s life, his place in the world, his conduct—\nnurturing life and responding to affairs,\nthere are things he cannot avoid.\nHow can he remain undisturbed in his *mechanism*?\n\nYet, if he adheres to the accord of the three *thieves*,\nnurtures life without exceeding his portion,\nresponds to affairs without seeking private gain—\nwhen things come, though countless,\nhe meets them with ease, leaving no trace of attachment.\nIf one does this,\nthe root of stillness and undisturbedness—\nhow could it ever be troubled?\n\nHence it is said:\n*Stir the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations will be at peace.*\nIf even a trace of desire slips into the *mechanism*,\nthen countless threads of thought become tangled,\nand he is pulled away with no time to reflect—\nhow could he then return to the original stillness and undisturbedness?\nEven a moment’s tranquility is unattainable,\nhow much more so the peace of the ten thousand transformations?\n\nWhat difference is there between this and starving oneself to sate hunger,\nor exhausting oneself to satisfy gluttony?\n\nMan knows his *shén* (spirit) but not the *shén* within the *shén*—\nthat which makes the *shén* divine.\n*Shén* refers to the manifestation of the spirit seen by ghosts.\nThe common man does not know the true principle of life and vitality,\ncontentment in one’s portion, and moderation—\nat every turn, his mind stirs with false intentions,\ncoveting what is beyond his fate,\nworrying over misfortune and calamity.\nHe prays to ghosts and gods,\nfawns for blessings beyond his due—\nthis is the *shén* he knows, the *shén* he worships.\nBut does he know the *shén* that is not *shén*—\nthe true source of divinity?\n\nMoreover, my *shén*—\nthough seen, it has no form,\nthough heard, it makes no sound—\nit shares virtue with Heaven and Earth,\nshares luminosity with the sun and moon,\nunfailing through the ages,\nunaltered through life and death.\nIt encompasses all transformations,\na thousand changes, ten thousand variations—\nusing it without strain,\nthis is called subtle and wondrous,\nthis is called the utmost divinity.\n\nLife and death are vast,\nyet one cannot align with their changes—\nhow much less can one hope to intervene in fortune and misfortune?\n\nWhen Confucius was ill,\nZǐlú requested prayers to the gods above and below.\nThe Master said: *My prayers have long been made.*\nThis is what is meant.»\n\nThe *Guān Yīn Zǐ* states: Only the Sage can be divine in divinity yet not enslaved by divinity.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuàn Jīng* says: The *heart* is the master of the body; the *shén* is the treasure of the heart.\n\nThe *Yì* says: *Shén* is that which subtly permeates all things and gives voice to them.\nSwift without haste, arriving without movement.\nThose who study must refine their thoughts with precision—\nthen they will surely attain it themselves.\n\nThe sun and moon follow their courses,\nthe great and small observe their numbers—\nthus the Sage’s work arises, and divine luminosity emerges.\nThis is the proof of the refined thought and profound exploration,\nand scholars must pay close attention to it.\n\nThe *sun*, the Great Yang, completes its celestial circuit in one year;\nthe *moon*, the Great Yin, completes its celestial circuit in one month—\nthis is the sun and moon following their courses.\nThirty days mark the full cycle, twenty-nine days the lesser—\nthis is the great and small observing their numbers.\n\nFrom Winter Solstice, when one Yang first stirs,\nto forty-five days later when Spring is established,\nthree Yang forces harmonize, and grasses and trees begin to sprout—\nthus it is said: the Sage’s work arises.\nUntil the *Jīngdàn* (surprise, the 8th hexagram), when the Yang grows ever longer,\nthe Yin recedes and fades, the hexagram enters *Dà Zhuàng* (Great Strength),\nand thunder begins to sound—\nthus it is said: divine luminosity emerges.\n\nBefore Winter Solstice, all things return to their roots,\ndivine luminosity lies hidden, obscure and dim,\nits form unseen.\n\nIt is likened to the utmost divinity still veiled,\nstuck in darkness, as if trapped in utter Yin—\nnothing can be seen, every touch is obstructed.\n\nYet when one observes the Sage’s work in generating life,\nand steals this method for self-cultivation,\nmaintaining emptiness and stillness,\nto seek the *shén* that is not *shén*—\nbut the source of divinity—\nday after day, ceaselessly,\nlike a hen brooding her eggs,\nwarmth sustained without pause,\naccumulating effort unbroken,\nuntil suddenly there is an awakening—\nthen the One Yang returns.\n\nThe *Yì* says: *Does it not reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth?*\nOnce the heart is awakened,\nretreat and conceal within the profound,\nday and night holding fast with purity—\ndivine luminosity grows strong,\nknowing how to employ its radiance—\nthis is when the Dao of the gentleman endures.\nIs this not the Sage’s work arising?\n\nWhen purity is held long,\nthe practice refined,\nthe *shén* becomes round and luminous,\nsuddenly unobstructed,\nfree to move in all directions,\nfinding ease on every side—\na realm of effortless transformation,\nstanding independent above all things—\nis this not divine luminosity emerging?\n\nWhen study reaches this point,\nits effort is consummate.\nOne can consort with Heaven and Earth,\nparticipate in the workings of creation,\nwalk upon water and fire,\ncommand flying dragons,\nroam beyond the four seas—\nand enter the utmost divinity.\n\nTo steal material things for life is the lesser theft;\nto steal the radiance of the seasons\nto fulfill one’s cultivation—\nthis is the greater theft.\nThus it is further said: *Its theft of the Dao’s mechanisms.*\n\nThe theft of the Dao’s mechanisms—\nno one in the world can see it, no one can know it.\nThe gentleman who attains it remains steadfast in poverty,\nthe petty man who attains it risks his life.\n\nThough the attainment is the same,\nthere are gentlemen and petty men—\nfor their perception differs in purity and turbidity,\ntheir practice varies in goodness and corruption.\nThus the names of gentleman and petty man are established.\n\nThe practice of goodness is to dwell content in one’s natural state,\nto nourish life with moderation,\nsteadfastly aligning with Heaven’s harmony,\nnever altering to await exhaustion—\nlike Yán Zǐ, with one bowl of rice and one gourd of drink,\nliving in a humble lane,\nwhile others could not bear his hardships,\nYán Zǐ unchanging in his joy.\nThis is the gentleman attaining it and remaining steadfast in poverty.\n\nThe practice of corruption is to indulge every desire,\nto abandon virtue and defy righteousness,\nto greedily seize without shame,\nto disregard peril and destruction—\nlike the bandit Zhì, rampaging across the world,\nstrong and violent, sparing neither father nor brother,\nmeeting his death at Dōng Líng.\nThis is the petty man attaining it and risking his life.\n\nAh! All men share the same nature received from Heaven,\nno inherent difference between gentlemen and petty men—\nyet by their theft of the Dao’s mechanisms,\ngoodness and corruption arise,\nleading to such vast separation between gentlemen and petty men.\nCan one not choose wisely?\n\n*Yellow Emperor’s Yīn Fú Jīng*, Volume on the Heart’s Method, concludes.\n\n**Shù Tóngchuān’s Six Void Hermit Xū Yuānyī’s Annotation**\n**Chapter on Overcoming Desire and Restoring the Original Command**\n\nThe blind excel in hearing; the deaf excel in sight.\nCut off the single source of desire, and the effect is tenfold that of a master’s army.\nFor the blind, though their eyes cannot see color,\ntheir minds are wholly devoted to the ears—thus their hearing is acute.\nFor the deaf, though their ears cannot hear sound,\ntheir minds are wholly devoted to the eyes—thus their sight is clear.\n\nDesire is the function of ears and eyes,\nthe object of human craving—also desire.\nA \"master\" refers to war.\n\"Tenfold\" means one-tenth of ten thousand—an immense force.\n\nThough the deaf and blind lack the advantages of ears and eyes,\nthey attain the abilities of keen hearing and sharp vision—\nfor their minds are concentrated, their wills unified.\n\nTake the student of the Dao as one such as the deaf and blind:\nwith unwavering focus, they block the senses’ sharpness,\nsever the root of private desire,\nrendering ears and eyes empty and at ease,\nthe heart’s chamber still and void.\nDay by day, Heaven’s principle grows dominant while human desire fades,\nits efficacy surpassing even the master’s army by tenfold—\nthis is the initial stage of nurturing the spirit,\nthe threshold of entering the Way.\n\nYet the scholar must not rest here—\nthey must strive further, aiming for the utmost.\n\n**Threefold reversal, day and night—**\na force a thousandfold greater than the master’s army.\n\"Three\" refers to the three essentials.\n\"Reversal\" means turning back.\n\"Day and night\" signifies continuous, unbroken practice.\n\nTo listen is to follow sound; to see is to yield to color;\nto speak is to indulge in rhetoric—\nthese are the pursuits the world holds dear,\nyet those who spend their lives thus, never turning back—\nalas, how sorrowful.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Threefold reversal, day and night\"*—\nthat is, reversing the ears’ hearing to silence,\nreversing the eyes’ seeing to emptiness,\nreversing the mouth’s speech to stillness.\nWhen these three are reversed,\none essence remains alone, preserved with utmost vigilance,\nday and night without pause—\nhuman desire cannot enter, and evil *qi* cannot intrude.\nWith daily cultivation deepening, Heaven’s principle becomes pure and refined,\nreturning to the origin, restoring the original command, and returning to the root.\nCompared to the master’s army’s victory,\nits power is ten thousand times greater—\ntruly the supreme refinement of nurturing the spirit,\nthe ultimate attainment of the Way.\n\nThe *Canon of the Three Harmonies* states:\n*\"Seal the three treasures—ears, eyes, mouth—\ndo not let them emit.\nThis is how the True Person dwells in the profound abyss,\nfloating and guarding within the rule.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThe mind arises from things and perishes in things—\nthe mechanism lies in the eyes.\nThe eyes are the doors and windows of the body,\nthe foremost of the three essentials,\ntheir function to see.\nWhen the mind resides within them, it can perceive;\nperception leads to attachment;\nattachment leads to desire.\nOnce private desire stirs, it flows without return—\nthus the mind is lost to things.\n\nDid the ancient Perfect Ones not see things with their eyes?\nRather, when they saw things, they passed through them directly—\nhow could their minds perish in things?\n\n*Laozi* says:\n*\"Do not see what is desirable,\nso that the mind does not become disordered.\"*\nIt is not that they did not see—\nbut that they saw no desirability.\n\nZhang Zhēnrén said:\n*\"Seeing things is seeing the mind;\nwithout things, the mind is unseen.\"*\nThis saying is profound—why?\nFor when one sees things, they see the mind;\nseeing the mind means no longer seeing things.\nIf a person, in the act of seeing things, can perceive their own mind—\ntruly, the entire world is but their mind manifest,\nwith nothing concealed—what then is \"thing\"?\n\nHeaven’s lack of favor gives rise to its greatest benevolence.\nSwift thunder and violent winds move all things blindly.\nAll creatures, teeming and diverse, all receive from Heaven—\nyet Heaven never bestows anything in return.\nHeaven’s lack of favor means it does not demand repayment from all things,\nyet all things spontaneously revere Heaven—\nthus arises Heaven’s greatest benevolence.\n\nYet Heaven does not possess this benevolence;\nat times, it manifests as change—\nswift thunder and violent winds, shaking all things.\nHeaven’s wondrous operations are all clearly displayed.\nThe teachings of *Yīn Fú* take observing Heaven’s Way as their essence.\nThis speaks of Heaven’s lack of favor,\nintending for the ruler to observe it:\nto love and nourish the people without calling it benevolence,\nso the people till and eat, weave and clothe themselves,\nsettled in their homes, content in their customs—\nand for those who govern the realm to observe it:\nto treat the ritual vessels and the body as straw dogs,\nto discard husks and seek profit,\nto preserve life by transcending the body,\nto forget knowledge and uphold virtue,\nso that the form is whole and the essence restored,\nunified with Heaven—\nis this not the greatest benevolence?\n\nAs for daily actions—\nseeing, hearing, joy, and anger—\nthese are the wondrous operations of nature,\nmanifesting without concealment.\nHow are they different from the sudden changes of thunder and wind?\n\nConsider this:\nThunder and wind are the divine *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nthe wondrous operations of yin and yang.\nBefore their manifestation, even spirits cannot fathom their hiding place;\nwhen they act, swift and fierce, all things are shaken.\nThis is like the human spirit and *qi* in their hidden, nurtured state—\nif not a single thought moves,\neven Zhī Zhū and Shī Guāng could not discern their form in sight or sound.\nYet when joy and anger arise, they are evident and cannot be concealed.\n\nIf one, before a thought stirs,\npossesses true faith and opens the eye of wisdom,\nperceiving without doubt,\nthen they may know the hidden place of thunder and wind.\nMoreover, in the arising of sight, hearing, joy, and anger,\nthey can recognize their own swift thunder and violent winds.\n\nGreat mechanisms and great operations all arrive blindly—\nthis is truly the *Yīn Fú* scholar’s true man.\n\nThe utmost joy is the surplus of nature;\nthe utmost stillness is purity.\nThe utmost joy is not the pleasure of wealth and comfort,\nbut the joy of returning to one’s true nature.\nThe joy of wealth and comfort is transient—\nwhen it arrives, decay follows—\nhow can it be called \"utmost\"?\n\nThe joy of returning to nature is serene,\never as if it had surplus—\nthus it is said: *\"The utmost joy is the surplus of nature.\"*\n\nConsider the commoner who abandons his homeland,\nleaves his kin, and drifts to a foreign land.\nAfter long years, when he finally returns home,\nseeing his parents, brothers, wife, and children,\ngathered in laughter and joy—\nhis delight is beyond words.\nHow much more so the joy of returning to nature,\nlong lost in dust and mire, sinking in the sea of suffering,\nsuddenly awakening with clarity,\nthe burdens of the body cast off,\nreturning to the original beginning,\nforgetting life and death, past and present—\nwhat joy can compare?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: **\"The utmost joy is without joy.\"**\nThis is what it means.\n\nAs for the virtuous and pure, none excel as they do in **至静** (ultimate stillness). **至静** is when the heart has no desires—when there are no desires, then true virtue is achieved. If one has not yet attained **至静**, though he strives diligently to cleanse himself and uphold purity, his heart still harbors desires for virtue—how can he be truly virtuous?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: **\"To let a virtuous man guard a treasury is not as good as sealing his doors shut, for it is his lack of desires that makes him so.\"**\n\nThe heavens’ **至私** (ultimate intimacy) is used in **至公** (ultimate fairness).\nThe creatures’ nature lies in **qi** (vital breath).\nThe heavens’ **Dao** is silent and obscure—**至私**—yet the four seasons unfold—**至公**.\nThis illustrates that **tianming** (heavenly fate) and **xing** (true nature) remain **zhanji** (profoundly still and serene), as the heavens’ ultimate intimacy.\nWhen **qi** moves, it manifests in the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, body, and mind—\nas sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, thought, and reflection—\njust as the four seasons unfold, without partiality or favor,\nrevealing the **xing**’s original **至公** (ultimate fairness).\nExtend this **至公** of nature to one’s family, state, and the world—\nwho could fail to be fair?\n\nYet still, this is but the **wen** (surface expression) of **Dao**,\nnot its **bao** (essence).\nBetter is to turn inward and suddenly awaken to self-possession.\nNone can truly know this—\nthis is my **至私** (ultimate intimacy) within **至私**,\nand when one attains it, the self is gone.\nIf the self is already gone,\nhow could there remain the **私** (partiality) of human emotions?\n\nIf one is thus, **性存** (true nature is preserved),\nand preservation awaits **pingdeng** (equanimity).\n\"Honor my elders and cherish my young,\nand extend this to all elders and young\"—\nwith such **Dao**, the world can be governed in the palm of one’s hand.\nWhy bother extending **性**’s fairness?\n\nAs for those who do not yet grasp the heavens’ **至私** (ultimate intimacy),\nnor apply **性**’s fairness,\nwhat their hearts preserve is but **人欲** (human desires).\nFew could resist indulging in **私** (partiality) and **欲** (desires),\nhardening their **qi** with strength—\nhow could they avoid this?\n\nThe **sage** loves others and always seeks to rescue them,\nso he says of **至公** (ultimate fairness): **\"The creatures’ nature lies in *qi*.\"**\nThis is to encourage those who have not yet awakened,\nso they may know that indulging desires and hardening *qi* harms **性** (true nature),\nand must instead strive with effort to restrain and regulate,\nto keep desires from moving and *qi* from becoming rigid,\nreturning to **虚** (emptiness),\nand restoring **性** with **湛然** (profound clarity).\nIs this not good?\n\nIf even a single thought of desire is not extinguished,\nand a single surge of **忿** (indignation) is not still,\nthen **性** (true nature) is lost, **和** (harmony) is injured,\nand calamity befalls oneself and one’s kin—\nbeing enslaved by *qi* instead, whose fault is this?\n\nMencius said: **\"Hold firm to one’s resolve, and do not vent one’s *qi*.\"**\nThe *Laozi* said: **\"When the heart commands *qi*, it is called *qiang* (rigidity).\nWhen things grow rigid, they grow old.\"**\nThis is called **\"not Dao\"**—\nand **\"not Dao\"** will soon perish.\n\nLife is the root of death,\ndeath is the root of life.\nLife is what people delight in,\ndeath is what people abhor.\nThe heart strives to delight in life,\nyet overindulgence in **荣养** (nourishment and honor)\nharms life—so those who delight in life\nare actually the root of death.\nThus it is said: **\"Life is the root of death.\"**\n\nA hundred thoughts of death and stillness,\n**寂淡无为** (tranquil and undisturbed),\npreserving **性** and safeguarding **真** (authenticity),\nwithout harming the body—\nthus those whose hearts are dead\nare the foundation of true life.\nThus it is said: **\"Death is the root of life.\"**\n\nLong ago, **Guangchengzi** dwelled in the **Kongdong** mountains,\nrefining his body for a thousand two hundred years,\nyet his form never decayed—\nthis is the **Dao** itself.\n\nHe said to the **Yellow Emperor**:\n**\"The essence of the ultimate *Dao* is **yao yao ming ming** (profoundly mysterious and silent).\nThe peak of the ultimate *Dao* is **hun hun mo mo** (dimly luminous and wordless).\nWithout sight or hearing,\nembracing the **神** (spirit) in stillness—\nthe body will naturally align,\nrequiring only stillness and purity.\nDo not exhaust your form,\ndo not agitate your spirit—\nthen the body will attain **长生** (longevity),\nthis is the key to preserving life.\"**\n\nBut in **至论** (ultimate discourse), it is otherwise:\n**性** (true nature) knows no life or death—\nwhen it emerges, it is life;\nwhen it returns, it is death.\nWhy must one who lives here necessarily die there,\nand only then can there be life here without death there?\nHow else could there be life here without death there?\n\nThus, this life depends on that death as its root,\nand that death in turn depends on this life as its root.\nLife and death alternate,\nemerging and returning like a cycle without end.\nWho can comprehend this—\nthat life and death emerge and return together,\nnever having been born, never having died?\n\nTo clarify this is to sever its root,\nto stand alone and unchanging.\nThe *Zhuangzi* says:\n**\"Only after life emerges externally can one then attain morning clarity,\nmorning clarity then reveals the solitary,\nthe solitary then knows no ancient or modern,\nand no ancient or modern then enters into *non-death, non-life*.\"**\nWhere now can one find such a person of **朝彻** (morning clarity),\nto converse with him on this?\n\n**恩** (blessing) arises from **害** (harm),\n**害** arises from **恩**.\nTo indulge desires and prolong attachments,\nthe world calls it beneficial to life—\nyet who knows that when desires prevail,\n**天性** (heavenly nature) is extinguished,\nand no greater harm exists?\nThus it is said: **\"Blessing arises from harm.\"**\n\nTo reject desires and set aside attachments,\nthe world calls it detrimental to life—\nyet who knows that when desires are gone,\n**天性** is preserved whole,\nand no greater blessing exists?\nThus it is said: **\"Harm arises from blessing.\"**\n\nFrom this perspective,\nthe bonds of **君臣父子** (lord and subject, parent and child),\nand the gatherings of **兄弟朋友** (brothers and friends),\nthe interplay of blessing and harm—\nhow can they be fixed?\n\nLike **阴阳** (yin and yang),\nor the shifting of **晴晦** (clear and cloudy),\nnothing is ever purely one without the other,\nor constant without change—\nonly **Dao** is thus.\n\nThose who embody **Dao** are **淡漠虚静** (serene and detached),\nturning inward before life arises,\nand then their joy is boundless—\nwhat place for blessing or harm in this?\n\nBefore one attains this level,\none must still consider **得宠思辱** (gaining favor, anticipating insult),\nand **居安虑危** (dwelling in ease, worrying about peril),\nso as to avoid losing blessings or suffering harm.\nBut for the **养生君子** (noble one who cultivates life),\neven in **ruanxi** (humble seating) and meals,\nthe interplay of blessing and harm is most acute—\nhow could one not be cautious?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* says:\n**\"Those who love horses\nfill baskets with grain and arrows,\nand use gourds to collect their urine,\nyet when a mosquito or gnat flies by,\nthey whip their attendants without restraint—\nthen the horses lose their bits,\ntheir heads are injured,\nand their chests are broken.\"**\n\nWhere the mind reaches, love is lost—\nthis is the meaning.\n\nThe foolish take the patterns of Heaven and Earth as sacred,\nfor they are without true knowing.\nThose without true knowing\nmerely gaze upward at celestial patterns,\npeer downward at terrestrial features,\ndelve exhaustively into classics and histories,\nprobe deeply into yin and yang,\nbelieving they have mastered the Dao of the sages.\nYet who truly knows the patterns of Heaven and Earth?\nThe *Jing* and *Shi* are the remnants left by the sages—\ntraps for fish and rabbits.\nThey follow the currents but lose the source,\ngrasp the branches while abandoning the root,\nspend their years without returning—\nis this not folly?\nThus it is said:\n*The foolish take the patterns of Heaven and Earth as sacred.*\n\nAt fifty-one, Confucius had not yet heard the Dao,\nso he journeyed south to Pei and met Lao Dan.\nLao Dan said:\n*\"I have heard you are a sage from the north.\nHave you attained the Dao?\"*\nConfucius replied:\n*\"Not yet.\"*\nLao Dan asked:\n*\"Where do you seek it?\"*\nConfucius said:\n*\"I have sought it through rites and measures\nfor five years, yet have not found it.\"*\nLao Dan asked again:\n*\"Where else do you seek it?\"*\nConfucius said:\n*\"I have sought it through yin and yang\nfor twelve years, yet have not found it.\"*\nLao Dan said:\n*\"From this, it seems Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s features,\nyin and yang’s measures—\nall are things that can be learned and attained.\nWhat is not transmitted is the subtle essence,\nobtained by the heart—\nthis is the Dao of the sages.\"*\n\nDuke Huan read scriptures in the hall above.\nLun Bian carved wheels below, setting aside his mallet and axe,\nand climbed up to ask:\n*\"May I ask what you are reading, Lord?\"*\nThe Duke said:\n*\"The words of the sages.\"*\nLun Bian asked:\n*\"Are the sages still alive?\"*\nThe Duke said:\n*\"They have passed away.\"*\nLun Bian said:\n*\"Then what you read are the dregs of the ancients.\nHow can one who craves dregs\nclaim to know the subtle essence of the heart?\nI perceive the patterns of things in their time.\"*\n*\"The Dao is near, yet if one seeks it far,\nit cannot be found.\nTurn inward to seek it near—\nthen it is present in daily life.\nIn all things and affairs,\nthe Dao is never absent.\nYet they do not know this,\nand seek the patterns of Heaven and Earth as sacred—\neven if they find them,\nwhat share do they have in the Dao?\nThus the sages extend what they know\nto guide later learners,\nsaying: ‘I perceive the patterns of things in their time.’\n‘Things in their time’ refers to what is seen in the present moment.\n‘Patterns’ refers to what is felt in the present moment.\n‘Wisdom’ is understanding.\nThings vary in size, affairs in weight—\nthis is the perception of things in their time.\nTo respond and discern in greatness and smallness, weight and lightness—\nthis judgment of patterns\nis not revealed by one’s innate true knowing?\nThe sages taught this to illuminate later generations,\nso that those who ponder would awaken to their true nature,\nreturning to the origin and essence,\nuntil they see the Dao alive and vibrant before them.\nAh! Is this not the way of the Yellow Emperor?\nThe common people live this way daily—\nyet few recognize it.\n\nIf one awakens to true wisdom in responding to affairs and sensing things,\ntheir innate true knowing is revealed—\nclear and unerring—\nand they may ride beside the Yellow Emperor,\nascending to the heavens and playing among the clouds.\n\nSomeone might say:\n*\"To speak of the Yellow Emperor’s Dao in terms of responding to affairs—\nis this not crude?\"*\nI remained silent.\nWhen pressed further, I said:\n*\"A person’s beauty or ugliness is known only through reflection—\nwithout reflection, one does not know.\nThe heart’s subtlety is revealed only through sensing things—\nwithout things, the heart remains unseen.\nThe sages understood the heart’s subtlety in daily life,\nnever to be separated for an instant.\nThus they spoke of what is close at hand,\nshowing the path of entry,\nso that people might easily awaken in daily life—\njust as one must ascend from below to reach heights,\nor travel near to go far.\nWhy doubt this?\"*\n\nDongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi:\n*\"Where is the Dao?\"*\nZhuangzi replied:\n*\"The Dao is nowhere absent.\"*\nDongguo Zi said:\n*\"Then it must be sought deliberately.\"*\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"It is in the ant.\"*\nDongguo Zi said:\n*\"How low!\"*\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"It is in the millet.\"*\nDongguo Zi said:\n*\"How even lower!\"*\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"It is in the tiles and rubble.\"*\nDongguo Zi said:\n*\"How even more so!\"*\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"It is in excrement and urine.\"*\nDongguo Zi sought the Dao’s location,\nand Zhuangzi answered thus—\nwas this not the perception of things in their time?\n\nThe *Zhongyong* says:\n*\"The poem says:\n‘The hawk flies to the heavens, the fish leaps in the depths.’\nThis speaks of discernment above and below.\nAre not the hawk and fish things of their time?\nTo soar to the heavens and leap in the depths—\nare these not the patterns of the hawk and fish?\nDiscernment above and below—\nis this not the innate true wisdom of a person,\nrevealed in their looking up and down?\nWho else but Zisi could perceive this?\"*\n\nSince the first patriarch Bodhidharma came from the West,\nhe established no scriptures,\nbut pointed directly to the human heart,\nsaying: *\"See your nature and become a Buddha.\"*\nLater inheritors of his transmission\ninteracted with the world,\nguiding seekers through methods—\nsome shouted, some struck with a staff;\nsome raised a finger, some pinched the Buddha’s image;\nsome said: *\"The green pine before the hall is true suchness,\"*\nsome said: *\"The lantern in the courtyard is the Dharma-nature.\"*\nSome declared:\n*\"Brightly bright at every grass tip—\nbrightly bright is the Ancestor’s intent.\"*\nOthers said:\n*\"The verdant bamboo is all true thusness,\nthe yellow flowers are none other than prajña.\"*\nEven to divine miracles—\nmoving water, carrying firewood—\nall served to expound the essence.\nWas this not the perception of things in their time?\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nthose who grasped this teaching are countless—\nyet scholars study the theory of *things in their time and their patterns*,\nbut few awaken to its meaning.\nAh!\nWords have their roots, affairs have their masters.\nThe sages used *things in their time and their patterns*\nas a metaphor to reveal the subtlety of the heart’s law.\nLearners must seek their own roots and masters—\ndo not debate whether it is *things in their time and their patterns*,\nbut align the Yellow Emperor’s heart with your own.\n\n「Otherwise, the Yellow Emperor has already ascended the Dragon and departed, while the foolish merely cling to the traces of his carriage.*  Others consider me ignorant, but I do not consider myself so. *Ignorance* is but a measure.\n\nThe true wisdom reveals clarity—\nto cling rigidly to doctrines and conjecture the Yellow Emperor’s Dao,\nto stray from one’s own true nature—\nthis is the ultimate folly.\nThus it is said: *“Others consider me ignorant,”*\nbut *“I do not consider myself so,”*\nbecause the Emperor taught me that daily life and spontaneous response\nare all rooted in innate true wisdom,\nmanifesting according to principle without reliance on external learning—\nhow could there be any room for conjecture?\nThis is the most sincere and direct utterance.\n\nOthers expect the sages to be all-knowing,\nbut I do not seek their omniscience.\nThus it is said: *“To sink in water or enter fire is to court one’s own destruction.”*\n*Sainthood* means comprehensive understanding,\n*Expectation* means to meet or conform.\nOthers say the sages are all-knowing,\nand they strain to master scriptures and doctrines,\nto amass vast knowledge,\nto conform to the sages’ Dao.\nThus it is said: *“Others expect the sages to be all-knowing.”*\n\nYet the Dao cannot be grasped through knowledge,\nand knowledge cannot be recognized through recognition—\nif one seeks only to accumulate vast knowledge\nand conforms to the Dao of forgetting things and people,\nof suddenly attaining self-awareness,\nis this not a misguided path?\nI do not seek their omniscience,\nfor the Emperor taught me that it is not through the mind’s comprehensive understanding\nthat one attains the Dao and becomes a sage.\n*Sainthood* is merely a name given by others.\nI still do not claim to possess it—\nhow much less their Dao?\nThe Dao is already a forced designation—\nhow much less the sages themselves?\nIf one seeks sainthood through the mind’s comprehension,\nit is but to chase a name while abandoning reality,\nto pursue trivialities while losing the essential—\nlike sinking in water or entering fire,\nhow could one not perish?\nThus it is said: *“How much less water entering fire, courting destruction.”*\nWater and fire are inherently beneficial to humanity,\nyet their harm comes from humans thrusting themselves into them—\nthis is not the fault of water and fire, is it?\n\nScriptures are the sages’ legacy,\nleft to awaken those not yet awakened—\nyet later learners, enamored of their words,\noblivious to their substance?\nRecognizing the coarse while losing the refined?\nExhausting their intellects,\nconsuming their knowledge,\nstudying tirelessly day and night,\nonly to gain empty discourse,\ntheir intent to surpass others and seek fame and fortune,\nto feign sincerity and practice deceit,\nto extinguish true principle—\nis this not the same as courting destruction?\nIf one can truly learn for oneself,\nand exhaust the principles within scriptures to realize one’s nature,\nwhat more could the sages add?\nIf so, then why abandon the scriptures and histories?\n\nThe Dao of Nature is still—\nthus all things under Heaven are born.\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth is permeating—\nthus Yin and Yang prevail.\nYin and Yang, pushing and yielding,\ngenerate harmonious transformation.\nThe stillness of Nature is the foundation of the Dao.\nMotion produces Heaven and Earth,\ndivides Yin and Yang,\npushing and swaying to generate the Five Phases,\ntransforming all things—\nendless without cessation.\nWho sustains this?\nIt is the Dao of Nature.\nThe *West Ascension Classic* says:\n*“Nature gives birth to the Dao,\nthe Dao gives birth to the One,\nthe One gives birth to the Two,\nthe Two gives birth to the Three,\nthe Three gives birth to all things.”*\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*“The Yijing has the Supreme Ultimate,\nwhich generates the Two Principles,\nthe Two Principles generate the Four Symbols,\nthe Four Symbols generate the Eight Trigrams,\nthe Eight Trigrams determine auspiciousness and inauspiciousness.”*\nWhen the sages speak of this,\ndoes their teaching depend on words?\n\nIndeed, human nature is also like this.\nLet me explain:\nThe *Guan Yinzi* says:\n*“Nature is the heart before its arising.\nBefore the heart’s arising, it is still—\nin harmony with the Dao of Nature.”*\nWhen the heart moves,\nall dharmas arise simultaneously.\nFrom the vast—Heaven and Earth—\nto the minute—motes of dust,\nsquares, circles, straight, and curved—\nall transform and manifest,\nwithout end or limit.\nThis must be self-attested;\nonly then can one exhaust principles and realize nature,\nand complete the task of sagely learning.\nIf self-attestation is even slightly lacking,\nthen there is doubt—\neven the sages cannot help this.\n\nThus the sages know the Dao of Nature cannot be defied,\nand they establish teachings, rites, and laws accordingly.\nThe Dao of utmost stillness\ncannot be measured by calendrical or musical systems.\n*Calendrical* refers to the harmonization of Yin and Yang,\n*Musical* is the art of calculation.\nHow do the sages surpass others?\nThey know that Heaven and Earth have the Dao of Nature,\nhumans have innate Nature,\nand things have their natural functions—\nall cannot be separated.\nThus they set forth teachings, established rites, and created laws,\ntransmitted through the ages,\nto ensure that rulers and subjects, fathers and sons,\nbrothers, husbands, and wives\ndo not lose their proper order,\nthat all things do not lose their natural functions,\nand that all may align with their true nature,\npreserving the Great Harmony—\nnot artificially contrived,\nbut naturally so.\nThe Dao of utmost stillness is the Dao of Nature itself.\nSilent and scentless,\nit cannot be seen with the eyes or heard with the ears—\nonly those with sincere clarity and tacit understanding grasp it.\nHow could calendrical or musical systems measure this?\n\nThere exists a wondrous instrument,\nfrom which all phenomena arise.\nThe Eight Trigrams, the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches,\ndivine and inscrutable mechanisms.\nThe art of Yin and Yang’s mutual victory\nis clearly revealed in the symbols.\nThe *wondrous instrument* is another name for Nature’s Dao,\nfor the Supreme Ultimate,\nfor the human heart—\nZhuangzi called it *self-so-unique*.\nThe Eight Trigrams, Heavenly Stems, Earthly Branches,\nall flow from this wondrous instrument,\nthus it is said:\n*“There exists a wondrous instrument,\nfrom which all phenomena arise.”*\nThe sages renamed and taught this\nso that later learners might govern superficial knowledge\nwhile attaining the root,\nand reverse the flow to return to the origin.\nIf one can observe the Eight Trigrams,\nHeavenly Stems, Earthly Branches,\nand all phenomena,\nwithout forming other perceptions,\nand directly comprehend their essence,\nthen the wondrous instrument is attained.\nOtherwise, if one exhaustively examines\nthe Eight Trigrams, Heavenly Stems, Earthly Branches,\nand their omens,\nbut fails to grasp it,\nthen it is but fortune.\n*Divine and inscrutable mechanisms* refers to the wondrous instrument’s marvelous functions.\nIndeed, the *divine* is the unfathomable interplay of Yin and Yang,\nthe *inscrutable* is what sight and hearing cannot discern—\nhow much more so its mechanisms and depths?\nIt is but an exaltation of the wondrous instrument’s functions,\nso profound and mysterious,\nso difficult to measure or see.»\n\nYin and Yang—this refers to movement and stillness.\nThe art of mutual conquest is simply mutual pushing;\nwhen they push against each other, victory and defeat become apparent.\nWhen Yin conquers Yang, it leans toward stillness;\nwhen Yang conquers Yin, it leans toward movement.\nBalance in the middle is harmony.\nIf movement aligns with this balance, there is no venture that does not succeed;\nif movement strays from it, there is no venture that does not bring misfortune.\nMovement—here lie the threads of calamity and fortune, of life and death.\nThough this principle is profound and mysterious,\ndifficult to measure or perceive,\nits motion is as clear as the sun’s ascent—\nall phenomena under Heaven are illuminated by it.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Shining forth, it ascends into the realm of phenomena.\"*\n*Ascend* means to rise.\nThe Sage’s final admonition to humanity is to be cautious in movement.\n\nIf one, before taking action, clearly understands the wondrous instrument,\nand proceeds with affairs as a mirror reflects form or the moon prints upon water,\nthen not only will there be no fault in human affairs,\nbut one will also perceive one’s true nature.\nTrue wisdom, luminous and unobscured by movement,\nonly then fulfills the Sage’s teaching.\n\nYet still—\nthough I have spoken exhaustively of Qingcheng’s finest truths,\none must climb the heights to truly know them.\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Heart Method of the Yin Symbol Classic, Lower Scroll, ends here.*",

Concentrate fiercely and keenly.\nSilently observe within, and suddenly you will perceive.\nMy own silent observation—even the sages of past and future, with their mouths sealed and tongues bound,\ncould not describe the learning of the *Yin Fu Jing*—it is complete.\"*\n\nShould one not yet attain this, let them examine the following text:\nWhy?\n*Observe* (观) means *to see* (视), *to examine* (察).\n*Heaven* (天) refers to *Nature* (自然).\n*Dao* (道) means *principle* (理).\n*Grasp* (执) means *to hold* (持).\n*Movement* (行) means *to practice* (践履).\n\nIt states that those who study the Dao must observe and examine the natural principles of Heaven’s Dao,\nto understand their own inherent nature.\nThose who attain this must hold it in daily life, practicing it with pure mastery,\nso that not even for a moment do they depart from it.\n\nThe intent of the *Yin Fu Jing* is profound, complete, and cannot be surpassed.\nThis is the overarching principle of the text,\nwhich is fully elaborated in the following passages.\n\nHeaven has **Five Thieves** (五贼)—those who perceive them thrive.\nThe Dao of Heaven is but **One Qi** (一气),\nyet its transformations manifest as the **Five Phases** (五行).\nIt is not called the **Five Phases** but the **Five Thieves**,\nfor they embody Heaven’s Dao—unseen when viewed, unheard when listened to.\nThey operate between **Yin and Yang** (两仪),\nshifting cold and heat, evolving past and future,\ngenerating and transforming all things,\never advancing while abandoning nothing—who could fathom this?\nThus it says: *Heaven has Five Thieves.*\nTo *see* (见) is to *understand* (明),\nto *thrive* (昌) is to *flourish* (盛).\n\nIt means that observing Heaven’s Dao in its **One Qi**,\none perceives the **Five Phases** in their transformations;\napplying one’s own Dao in its **One Nature**,\none manifests the **Five Virtues** (五常) in their functions.\n\nThe **Five Virtues** (五常) are also formless and soundless,\nneither Yin nor Yang,\nyet they embody benevolence and righteousness,\nexcel in both flexibility and firmness,\nentering and exiting without fixed time,\nknown to no one in their origin.\nThose who understand—\ntheir **virtue** (德) of the Five Virtues shines ever more brilliant.\nThus it says: *Those who perceive them thrive.*\n\nThe **Five Thieves** reside in the heart,\nand their actions extend to Heaven.\nThe **Five Thieves** are the Dao of Heaven.\n*Reside in the heart* means that Heaven’s Dao dwells within the human heart.\nIf Heaven’s Dao resides in the heart,\nthen the heart itself is the Dao—how profound this statement!\n\nThe **Five Thieves** reside in the heart,\nfor fear that later generations,\nstudying the observation of Heaven’s Five Thieves,\nwould seek them only in Heaven’s Heaven (天之天),\nand fail to recognize that they must be sought in the Heaven of the heart (心之天).\n\nSuch words are piercing—\nthey urge one to exert effort in revealing the true nature of humanity.\n\nIf a person devotes all their strength to the **Five Thieves** residing in the heart,\nand directly assumes responsibility for them,\nas Zengzi did when he heard the Dao—*one thread runs through all*—\nand declared: *\"Beyond this ‘one thread,’ there are no other doubts.\"*\nTo grasp Confucius’ intent—\nis this not exhilarating?\n\nShould one not yet attain this,\nthey must focus entirely on the **Five Thieves** residing in the heart,\nconcentrating deeply and savoring its meaning,\nuntil they gain some insight,\nand then they will know that daily life is\nnothing but the manifestation of my heart’s Heaven,\nfree from all external interference—\nis this not the same as applying it to Heaven?\n\nThe *Inner Observation Jing* (《内观经》) states:\n*\"The Sage teaches people to cultivate the Dao—this is to cultivate the heart.\nTo teach people to cultivate the heart—this is to cultivate the Dao.\nOnly the word ‘cultivate’ (修) differs.\"*\n\nMencius said:\n*\"To exhaust one’s heart is to know one’s nature,\nand to know one’s nature is to know Heaven.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s words are so simple yet direct,\nso clear and unadulterated—\nwhy should scholars harbor any doubts?\n\nThe universe lies within one’s grasp,\nand all transformations arise from the body.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* (《通玄经》) states:\n*\"The four directions and the four extremes—this is the realm of *space* (宇).\nThe past and the future—this is the realm of *time* (宙).\nAll *transformations* (万化) are the endless changes of all things.\n*Grasp* (手) and *body* (身) refer to oneself.\"*\n\nIf a person truly attains the **Five Thieves** residing in the heart,\nand believes in it with conviction while understanding it thoroughly,\nthen even the vastness of the four directions and four extremes,\nthe boundless span of past and future,\nand the infinite transformations of all things—\nall flow from their own heart,\nand they need not rely on others.\nThus Mencius said:\n*\"All things are complete within me.\nTo return to sincerity within oneself—\nno greater joy exists.\"*\n\n**Heaven’s nature is humanity** (天性，人也).\n**The human heart is the mechanism** (人心，机也).\nHumans are born in stillness—\nthis is the nature of Heaven.\nThus it says: *Heaven’s nature is humanity.*\n\nWhen nature departs from stillness,\nit becomes movement and is called **heart** (心).\nThe heart is the sovereign of the body,\nthe essential mechanism of all transformations.\nThus it says: *The human heart is the mechanism.*\n\nThe *Great Harmony Jing* (《大通经》) states:\n*\"Stillness is called nature (性),\nyet the heart (心) is within it;\nMovement is called heart,\nyet nature is within it.\"*\n\nThe character **nature** (性) must not be merely taken as ink on paper—\none must reflect inwardly and verify it,\nuntil they truly grasp its meaning,\nand then their study will not be in vain.\nIf so, they will return to the origin and restore the fundamental,\ntranscend the mundane and enter the Sagehood—\nis this not a reality?\n\nOtherwise, mechanical cleverness and worldly cunning accumulate in the heart,\nclashing and wearing against external things,\nslipping away from Heaven’s nature,\nand degenerating into the delusions of the secular world—\nmaking daily life oblivious,\nas distant as Heaven and Earth—\nwhose fault is this?\n\nEstablish the Dao of Heaven,\nand thereby settle humanity.\n*Establish* (立) means *upright and unyielding* (刚正不倚).\nThe Dao of Heaven is the Dao of Heaven’s nature.\n*Settle* (定) means *to tranquilize* (镇静).\nHumanity refers to the heart of human desires (人欲).\n\nThe Dao of Heaven’s nature—\nwhen studied to the point of *boundless clarity without self*,\nwhat room remains for human desires?\nBefore reaching this stage,\none must exert effort and maintain it,\nstrengthening it with uprightness and unyielding resolve,\nto be the master of one’s body.\nTranquilizing the heart of human desires,\npreventing it from sprouting,\nthen the nine orifices and four limbs will not act recklessly,\nand the body’s inner and outer will all find peace.*\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: *Establish* the Dao of Heaven to *tranquilize* humanity. If one’s nature lacks the upright and unyielding substance, weak and unable to stand firm, then at the slightest movement, it yields to private human desires, indulging in licentiousness and extravagance, with no limit to its excesses. Such a one who seeks tranquility in the world—there has never been one.\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes its killing intent, dragons and serpents rise from the earth. When humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth are overturned.\n*Killing* here means *threatening power*. *Dragons and serpents* refer to the greatest of hidden forces. *Rising from the earth* means emerging from concealment. *Overturned* means *preverted*.\n\nHeaven’s threatening power is the thunder and lightning. When the time is for stillness, it conceals its intent, silent and unseen, hidden from all. When the time is for action, it responds in due season, without private motive or desire, its roar shaking all things, awakening the hidden and the dormant, freeing them from obscurity, allowing them to flourish and flow freely—all creatures benefit from its grace.\n\nHumanity’s threatening power is the subtle operation of the mind and spirit. Before its manifestation, it aligns with Heaven in perfect unity, imperceptible even to ghosts and spirits, let alone humans. When external things stir sensation, private desires arise, corrupting the purity of Heaven’s principle, unleashing the venom of tigers and wolves. Humanity suffers harm, and all things are disturbed. Hence the Sage laments:\n\n*\"When humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth are overturned\"*—meaning, how can the movement of the human heart be so utterly inverted from the Dao of Heaven and Earth?\n\nWhen Heaven and humanity act in harmony, the foundation of ten thousand transformations is set.\n*Heaven* refers to the Dao of Heaven. *Humanity* refers to the human heart. *Set* means *unshaken*. *Foundation* means *root*.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven responds in due season, without private motive or desire, and all things receive its grace. When humanity, in responding to affairs and engaging with things, governs itself with the same lack of private motive or desire, then Heaven and humanity act in perfect harmony.\n\nIf this is so, then when matters and things arise, they come like guests in a lofty hall—though they bring a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, they are met with discernment and without evasion. The still, round, and luminous root, unmoved, is never disturbed.\n\nYet if even a hair’s breadth of desire lingers within, then humanity unleashes its killing intent—how can this align with the foundation of ten thousand transformations?\n\nNature has skill and clumsiness, which can be concealed. The original, pure nature, still and undisturbed, is serene as the boundless void—how can there be skill or clumsiness?\n\nThe *Classic* says: *\"Nature has skill and clumsiness\"*—meaning the nature shaped by habit. One whose habit-formed nature is skilled in letters and numbers will be clumsy in archery and charioteering; one skilled in pottery will be unable to measure with the plumb and square.\n\nThus the Sage admonished: *\"It can be concealed.\"* *Concealed* means *not to display oneself*. If one displays oneself, then one’s abilities will surely be flaunted in arrogance, and one’s deficiencies will surely be sought in desperation. Arrogance leads to the loss of virtue, desperation wastes one’s true essence—both are delusions. Yet with the serene, pure nature, responding and flowing naturally, one nearly attains the Dao.\n\nThe nine orifices’ corruption lies in the three gateways, which can be controlled in stillness and motion. The human body, from head to foot, possesses nine orifices through which the virtue of spirit and intelligence flows—like the doors and windows of a dwelling. The three that govern life and death, order and chaos, are the ears, eyes, and mouth.\n\nThe ears hear sounds, the eyes see colors, the mouth speaks and argues—thus stirring the heart, sprouting desires, yielding to emotions, and losing one’s nature. Then the nine orifices become corrupt.\n\nYet, is it not natural for the ears to hear? For the eyes to see? For the mouth to speak? If one says no, humanity is not wood or stone—how could it not be so?\n\nThus the *Classic* says: *\"They can be controlled in stillness and motion.\"* *Controlled in stillness and motion* means teaching later learners that when these three gateways are stirred by sensation, one must discern what can be heard and heard, what can be seen and seen, what can be spoken and spoken. What cannot be heard, do not hear. What cannot be seen, do not see. What cannot be spoken, do not speak.\n\nIf this is so, then the corruption of the nine orifices will have no cause to arise, and the use of the three gateways can be controlled in stillness and motion.\n\nConfucius said: *\"Do not look at what is not proper, do not listen to what is not proper, do not speak of what is not proper, do not act on what is not proper—this is all.\"*\n\nFire arises from wood; when disaster strikes, it is certain to prevail. Treachery arises in the state; when it moves, it is certain to collapse. To know this and refine oneself—this is the Sage.\n\nWood giving rise to fire: fire blazes and wood is consumed. Treachery arising in the state: treachery flourishes and the state falls—this is the natural order.\n\nHumanity’s origin is such: if the pure nature remains serene and tranquil, merging with Heaven’s principle, then when the ears and eyes open to the external, and desires and aversions arise within, emotions separate from nature, *qi* scatters and essence is lost—before reaching Heaven’s allotted span, one meets premature death and ruin. How is this different from wood giving rise to fire, or treachery arising in the state?\n\nThe Sage transmitted this teaching, intending that later learners observe this, discard emotions and desires, cherish *qi* and economize spirit, remain still and without action, unwavering morning and evening. Such cultivation, such refinement—until the practice is perfected, there is sudden enlightenment to true nature, returning to the root and origin, transcending the mundane and entering sainthood—the Dao of the Sage.\n\nThus it is said: *To know this and refine oneself*—this is the Sage.\n\n*The Heart Method of the Yellow Emperor’s Secret of the Dark* concludes here.\n*The Heart Method of the Yellow Emperor’s Secret of the Dark* continues.",

exceeds one’s portion,\nindulges in desires and gluttony,\nexhausts the spirit without rest—\nis this not like using the *Huìhóu’s pearl* to hunt a single yellow sparrow?\n*Absurd!*\n\n*The Scripture on Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancients who delighted in the Dao\nate just enough to fill their emptiness and sustain their *qi*,\nclothed themselves just enough to cover their form and ward off cold—\nthey did not covet gain or hoard excess.\nThey kept their eyes clear without seeing,\nears still without hearing,\nmouth closed without speaking,\nmind surrendered without deliberating.\nThey found no joy, no suffering,\nno preference, no aversion—\nall things were mysteriously unified,\nneither this nor that.\n\nThe three *thieves* were thus in accord,\nthe three *talents* were thus at peace.\n*In accord* means:\nHeaven and Earth delight in nurturing all things,\nall things delight in completing, thriving, and multiplying,\nman delights in contentment and moderation—\nif the three find harmony in their accord,\nthen the three *talents* all attain their natural ease.\n\nIf Heaven does not rain in due time,\nif Earth does not give birth to things,\nthen Heaven and Earth are *not in accord*.\nIf grains and crops do not bear fruit,\nif eggs and offspring are not produced,\nthen all things are *not in accord*.\nIf one defies fate and exceeds one’s portion,\nindulges in desires and greed,\ninternally disturbs the spirit and *qi*,\nexternally harms the body’s harmony,\nthen human nature is *not in accord*.\n\nLearners must take what is proper,\ndiscard what is improper—\ninternally attaining a tranquil mind,\nexternally attaining harmony in human affairs,\nall things flourishing and multiplying,\ncalamities and misfortunes not arising—\nthus delighting in the governance of great peace.\n\nHence it is said:\n*Eat in season, and the hundred limbs will be in order.*\n*Stir the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations will be at peace.*\n\nFood is what nourishes the body,\nand its value lies in eating in season—\nthen the five *zàng* organs are fully harmonized,\nthe hundred limbs healthy and strong,\ndelighting in the emotions of life’s vitality,\nneither deficiency nor excess will bring illness.\n\nThis concludes the discussion of the three *thieves*’ accord\nand elaborates on the meaning of *stirring the mechanism*.\n\nWhen a man’s mind is still and undisturbed,\nclear as the boundless void,\nwhat is there to speak of as a *mechanism*?\n\nThe moment an intention arises,\nbefore it manifests outwardly—\nthis is what others do not know,\nbut I alone perceive—\nand this I call the *mechanism*.\n\nMan’s life, his place in the world, his conduct—\nnurturing life and responding to affairs,\nthere are things he cannot avoid.\nHow can he remain undisturbed in his *mechanism*?\n\nYet, if he adheres to the accord of the three *thieves*,\nnurtures life without exceeding his portion,\nresponds to affairs without seeking private gain—\nwhen things come, though countless,\nhe meets them with ease, leaving no trace of attachment.\nIf one does this,\nthe root of stillness and undisturbedness—\nhow could it ever be troubled?\n\nHence it is said:\n*Stir the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations will be at peace.*\nIf even a trace of desire slips into the *mechanism*,\nthen countless threads of thought become tangled,\nand he is pulled away with no time to reflect—\nhow could he then return to the original stillness and undisturbedness?\nEven a moment’s tranquility is unattainable,\nhow much more so the peace of the ten thousand transformations?\n\nWhat difference is there between this and starving oneself to sate hunger,\nor exhausting oneself to satisfy gluttony?\n\nMan knows his *shén* (spirit) but not the *shén* within the *shén*—\nthat which makes the *shén* divine.\n*Shén* refers to the manifestation of the spirit seen by ghosts.\nThe common man does not know the true principle of life and vitality,\ncontentment in one’s portion, and moderation—\nat every turn, his mind stirs with false intentions,\ncoveting what is beyond his fate,\nworrying over misfortune and calamity.\nHe prays to ghosts and gods,\nfawns for blessings beyond his due—\nthis is the *shén* he knows, the *shén* he worships.\nBut does he know the *shén* that is not *shén*—\nthe true source of divinity?\n\nMoreover, my *shén*—\nthough seen, it has no form,\nthough heard, it makes no sound—\nit shares virtue with Heaven and Earth,\nshares luminosity with the sun and moon,\nunfailing through the ages,\nunaltered through life and death.\nIt encompasses all transformations,\na thousand changes, ten thousand variations—\nusing it without strain,\nthis is called subtle and wondrous,\nthis is called the utmost divinity.\n\nLife and death are vast,\nyet one cannot align with their changes—\nhow much less can one hope to intervene in

their hearing is acute.\nFor the deaf, though their ears cannot hear sound,\ntheir minds are wholly devoted to the eyes—thus their sight is clear.\n\nDesire is the function of ears and eyes,\nthe object of human craving—also desire.\nA \"master\" refers to war.\n\"Tenfold\" means one-tenth of ten thousand—an immense force.\n\nThough the deaf and blind lack the advantages of ears and eyes,\nthey attain the abilities of keen hearing and sharp vision—\nfor their minds are concentrated, their wills unified.\n\nTake the student of the Dao as one such as the deaf and blind:\nwith unwavering focus, they block the senses’ sharpness,\nsever the root of private desire,\nrendering ears and eyes empty and at ease,\nthe heart’s chamber still and void.\nDay by day, Heaven’s principle grows dominant while human desire fades,\nits efficacy surpassing even the master’s army by tenfold—\nthis is the initial stage of nurturing the spirit,\nthe threshold of entering the Way.\n\nYet the scholar must not rest here—\nthey must strive further, aiming for the utmost.\n\n**Threefold reversal, day and night—**\na force a thousandfold greater than the master’s army.\n\"Three\" refers to the three essentials.\n\"Reversal\" means turning back.\n\"Day and night\" signifies continuous, unbroken practice.\n\nTo listen is to follow sound; to see is to yield to color;\nto speak is to indulge in rhetoric—\nthese are the pursuits the world holds dear,\nyet those who spend their lives thus, never turning back—\nalas, how sorrowful.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Threefold reversal, day and night\"*—\nthat is, reversing the ears’ hearing to silence,\nreversing the eyes’ seeing to emptiness,\nreversing the mouth’s speech to stillness.\nWhen these three are reversed,\none essence remains alone, preserved with utmost vigilance,\nday and night without pause—\nhuman desire cannot enter, and evil *qi* cannot intrude.\nWith daily cultivation deepening, Heaven’s principle becomes pure and refined,\nreturning to the origin, restoring the original command, and returning to the root.\nCompared to the master’s army’s victory,\nits power is ten thousand times greater—\ntruly the supreme refinement of nurturing the spirit,\nthe ultimate attainment of the Way.\n\nThe *Canon of the Three Harmonies* states:\n*\"Seal the three treasures—ears, eyes, mouth—\ndo not let them emit.\nThis is how the True Person dwells in the profound abyss,\nfloating and guarding within the rule.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThe mind arises from things and perishes in things—\nthe mechanism lies in the eyes.\nThe eyes are the doors and windows of the body,\nthe foremost of the three essentials,\ntheir function to see.\nWhen the mind resides within them, it can perceive;\nperception leads to attachment;\nattachment leads to desire.\nOnce private desire stirs, it flows without return—\nthus the mind is lost to things.\n\nDid the ancient Perfect Ones not see things with their eyes?\nRather, when they saw things, they passed through them directly—\nhow could their minds perish in things?\n\n*Laozi* says:\n*\"Do not see what is desirable,\nso that the mind does not become disordered.\"*\nIt is not that they did not see—\nbut that they saw no desirability.\n\nZhang Zhēnrén said:\n*\"Seeing things is seeing the mind;\nwithout things, the mind is unseen.\"*\nThis saying is profound—why?\nFor when one sees things, they see the mind;\nseeing the mind means no longer seeing things.\nIf a person, in the act of seeing things, can perceive their own mind—\ntruly, the entire world is but their mind manifest,\nwith nothing concealed—what then is \"thing\"?\n\nHeaven’s lack of favor gives rise to its greatest benevolence.\nSwift thunder and violent winds move all things blindly.\nAll creatures, teeming and diverse, all receive from Heaven—\nyet Heaven never bestows anything in return.\nHeaven’s lack of favor means it does not demand repayment from all things,\nyet all things spontaneously revere Heaven—\nthus arises Heaven’s greatest benevolence.\n\nYet Heaven does not possess this benevolence;\nat times, it manifests as change—\nswift thunder and violent winds, shaking all things.\nHeaven’s wondrous operations are all clearly displayed.\nThe teachings of *Yīn Fú* take observing Heaven’s Way as their essence.\nThis speaks of Heaven’s lack of favor,\nintending for the ruler to observe it:\nto love and nourish the people without calling it benevolence,\nso the people till and eat, weave and clothe themselves,\nsettled in their homes, content in their customs—\nand for those who govern the realm to observe it:\nto treat the ritual vessels and the body as straw dogs,\nto discard husks and seek profit,\nto preserve life by transcending the body,\nto forget knowledge and uphold virtue,\nso that the form is whole and the essence restored,\nunified with Heaven—\nis this not the greatest benevolence?\n\nAs for daily actions—\nseeing, hearing, joy, and anger—\nthese are the wondrous operations of nature,\nmanifesting without concealment.\nHow are they different from the sudden changes of thunder and wind?\n\nConsider this:\nThunder and wind are the divine *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nthe wondrous operations of yin and yang.\nBefore their manifestation, even spirits cannot fathom their hiding place;\nwhen they act, swift and fierce, all things are shaken.\nThis is like the human spirit and *qi* in their hidden, nurtured state—\nif not a single thought moves,\neven Zhī Zhū and Shī Guāng could not discern their form in sight or sound.\nYet when joy and anger arise, they are evident and cannot be concealed.\n\nIf one, before a thought stirs,\npossesses true faith and opens the eye of wisdom,\nperceiving without doubt,\nthen they may know the hidden place of thunder and wind.\nMoreover, in the arising of sight, hearing, joy, and anger,\nthey can recognize their own swift thunder and violent winds.\n\nGreat mechanisms and great operations all arrive blindly—\nthis is truly the *Yīn Fú* scholar’s true man.\n\nThe utmost joy is the surplus of nature;\nthe utmost stillness is purity.\nThe utmost joy is not the pleasure of wealth and comfort,\nbut the joy of returning to one’s true nature.\nThe joy of wealth and comfort is transient—\nwhen it arrives, decay follows—\nhow can it be called \"utmost\"?\n\nThe joy of returning to nature is serene,\never as if it had surplus—\nthus it is said: *\"The utmost joy is the surplus of nature.\"*\n\nConsider the commoner who abandons his homeland,\nleaves his kin, and drifts to a foreign land.\nAfter long years, when he finally returns home,\nseeing his parents, brothers, wife, and children,\ngathered in laughter and joy—\nhis delight is beyond words.\nHow much more so the joy of returning to nature,\nlong lost in dust and mire, sinking in the sea of suffering,\nsuddenly awakening with clarity,\nthe burdens of the

      "translated_text": "The *Zhuangzi* says: **\"The utmost joy is without joy.\"**\nThis is what it means.\n\nAs for the virtuous and pure, none excel as they do in **至静** (ultimate stillness). **至静** is when the heart has no desires—when there are no desires, then true virtue is achieved. If one has not yet attained **至静**, though he strives diligently to cleanse himself and uphold purity, his heart still harbors desires for virtue—how can he be truly virtuous?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: **\"To let a virtuous man guard a treasury is not as good as sealing his doors shut, for it is his lack of desires that makes him so.\"**\n\nThe heavens’ **至私** (ultimate intimacy) is used in **至公** (ultimate fairness).\nThe creatures’ nature lies in **qi** (vital breath).\nThe heavens’ **Dao** is silent and obscure—**至私**—yet the four seasons unfold—**至公**.\nThis illustrates that **tianming** (heavenly fate) and **xing** (true nature) remain **zhanji** (profoundly still and serene), as the heavens’ ultimate intimacy.\nWhen **qi** moves, it manifests in the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, body, and mind—\nas sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, thought, and reflection—\njust as the four seasons unfold, without partiality or favor,\nrevealing the **xing**’s original **至公** (ultimate fairness).\nExtend this **至公** of nature to one’s family, state, and the world—\nwho could fail to be fair?\n\nYet still, this is but the **wen** (surface expression) of **Dao**,\nnot its **bao** (essence).\nBetter is to turn inward and suddenly awaken to self-possession.\nNone can truly know this—\nthis is my **至私** (ultimate intimacy) within **至私**,\nand when one attains it, the self is gone.\nIf the self is already gone,\nhow could there remain the **私** (partiality) of human emotions?\n\nIf one is thus, **性存** (true nature is preserved),\nand preservation awaits **pingdeng** (equanimity).\n\"Honor my elders and cherish my young,\nand extend this to all elders and young\"—\nwith such **Dao**, the world can be governed in the palm of one’s hand.\nWhy bother extending **性**’s fairness?\n\nAs for those who do not yet grasp the heavens’ **至私** (ultimate intimacy),\nnor apply **性**’s fairness,\nwhat their hearts preserve is but **人欲** (human desires).\nFew could resist indulging in **私** (partiality) and **欲** (desires),\nhardening their **qi** with strength—\nhow could they avoid this?\n\nThe **sage** loves others and always seeks to rescue them,\nso he says of **至公** (ultimate fairness): **\"The creatures’ nature lies in *qi*.\"**\nThis is to encourage those who have not yet awakened,\nso they may know that indulging desires and hardening *qi* harms **性** (true nature),\nand must instead strive with effort to restrain and regulate,\nto keep desires from moving and *qi* from becoming rigid,\nreturning to **虚** (emptiness),\nand restoring **性** with **湛然** (profound clarity).\nIs this not good?\n\nIf even a single thought of desire is not extinguished,\nand a single surge of **忿** (indignation) is not still,\nthen **性** (true nature) is lost, **和** (harmony) is injured,\nand calamity befalls oneself and one’s kin—\nbeing enslaved by *qi* instead, whose fault is this?\n\nMencius said: **\"Hold firm to one’s resolve, and do not vent one’s *qi*.\"**\nThe *Laozi* said: **\"When the heart commands *qi*, it is called *qiang* (rigidity).\nWhen things grow rigid, they grow old.\"**\nThis is called **\"not Dao\"**—\nand **\"not Dao\"** will soon perish.\n\nLife is the root of death,\ndeath is the root of life.\nLife is what people delight in,\ndeath is what people abhor.\nThe heart strives to delight in life,\nyet overindulgence in **荣养** (nourishment and honor)\nharms life—so those who delight in life\nare actually the root of death.\nThus it is said: **\"Life is the root of death.\"**\n\nA hundred thoughts of death and stillness,\n**寂淡无为** (tranquil and undisturbed),\npreserving **性** and safeguarding **真** (authenticity),\nwithout harming the body—\nthus those whose hearts are dead\nare the foundation of true life.\nThus it is said: **\"Death is the root of life.\"**\n\nLong ago, **Guangchengzi** dwelled in the **Kongdong** mountains,\nrefining his body for a thousand two hundred years,\nyet his form never decayed—\nthis is the **Dao** itself.\n\nHe said to the **Yellow Emperor**:\n**\"The essence of the ultimate *Dao* is **yao yao ming ming** (profoundly mysterious and silent).\nThe peak of the ultimate *Dao* is **hun hun mo mo** (dimly luminous and wordless).\nWithout sight or hearing,\nembracing the **神** (spirit) in stillness—\nthe body will naturally align,\nrequiring only stillness and purity.\nDo not exhaust your form,\ndo not agitate your spirit—\nthen the body will attain **长生** (longevity),\nthis is the key to preserving life.\"**\n\nBut in **至论** (ultimate discourse), it is otherwise:\n**性** (true nature) knows no life or death—\nwhen it emerges, it is life;\nwhen it returns, it is death.\nWhy must one who lives here necessarily die there,\nand only then can there be life here without death there?\nHow else could there be life here without death there?\n\nThus, this life depends on that death as its root,\nand that death in turn depends on this life as its root.\nLife and death alternate,\nemerging and returning like a cycle without end.\nWho can comprehend this—\nthat life and death emerge and return together,\nnever having been born, never having died?\n\nTo clarify this is to sever its root,\nto stand alone and unchanging.\nThe *Zhuangzi* says:\n**\"Only after life emerges externally can one then attain morning clarity,\nmorning clarity then reveals the solitary,\nthe solitary then knows no ancient or modern,\nand no ancient or modern then enters into *non-death, non-life*.\"**\nWhere now can one find such a person of **朝彻** (morning clarity),\nto converse with him on this?\n\n**恩** (blessing) arises from **害** (harm),\n**害** arises from **恩**.\nTo indulge desires and prolong attachments,\nthe world calls it beneficial to life—\nyet who knows that when desires prevail,\n**天性** (heavenly nature) is extinguished,\nand no greater harm exists?\nThus it is said: **\"Blessing arises from harm.\"**\n\nTo reject desires and set aside attachments,\nthe world calls it detrimental to life—\nyet who knows that when desires are gone,\n**天性** is preserved whole,\nand no greater blessing exists?\nThus it is said: **\"Harm arises from blessing.\"**\n\nFrom this perspective,\nthe bonds of **君臣父子** (lord and subject, parent and child),\nand the gatherings of **兄弟朋友** (brothers and friends),\nthe interplay of blessing and harm—\nhow can they be fixed?\n\nLike **阴阳** (yin and yang),\nor the shifting of **晴晦** (clear and cloudy),\nnothing is ever purely one without the other,\nor constant without change—\nonly **Dao** is thus.\n\nThose who embody **Dao** are **淡漠虚静** (serene and detached),\nturning inward before life arises,\nand then their joy is boundless—\nwhat place for blessing or harm in this?\n\nBefore one attains this level,\none must still consider **得宠思辱** (gaining favor, anticipating insult),\nand **居安虑危** (dwelling in ease, worrying about peril),\nso as to avoid losing blessings or suffering harm.\nBut for the **养生君子** (noble one who cultivates life),\neven in **ruanxi** (humble seating) and meals,\nthe interplay of blessing and harm is most acute—\nhow could one not be cautious?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* says:\n**\"Those who love horses\nfill baskets with grain and arrows,\nand use gourds to collect their urine,\nyet when a mosquito or gnat flies by,\nthey whip their attendants without

      "translated_text": "「Otherwise, the Yellow Emperor has already ascended the Dragon and departed, while the foolish merely cling to the traces of his carriage.*  Others consider me ignorant, but I do not consider myself so. *Ignorance* is but a measure.\n\nThe true wisdom reveals clarity—\nto cling rigidly to doctrines and conjecture the Yellow Emperor’s Dao,\nto stray from one’s own true nature—\nthis is the ultimate folly.\nThus it is said: *“Others consider me ignorant,”*\nbut *“I do not consider myself so,”*\nbecause the Emperor taught me that daily life and spontaneous response\nare all rooted in innate true wisdom,\nmanifesting according to principle without reliance on external learning—\nhow could there be any room for conjecture?\nThis is the most sincere and direct utterance.\n\nOthers expect the sages to be all-knowing,\nbut I do not seek their omniscience.\nThus it is said: *“To sink in water or enter fire is to court one’s own destruction.”*\n*Sainthood* means comprehensive understanding,\n*Expectation* means to meet or conform.\nOthers say the sages are all-knowing,\nand they strain to master scriptures and doctrines,\nto amass vast knowledge,\nto conform to the sages’ Dao.\nThus it is said: *“Others expect the sages to be all-knowing.”*\n\nYet the Dao cannot be grasped through knowledge,\nand knowledge cannot be recognized through recognition—\nif one seeks only to accumulate vast knowledge\nand conforms to the Dao of forgetting things and people,\nof suddenly attaining self-awareness,\nis this not a misguided path?\nI do not seek their omniscience,\nfor the Emperor taught me that it is not through the mind’s comprehensive understanding\nthat one attains the Dao and becomes a sage.\n*Sainthood* is merely a name given by others.\nI still do not claim to possess it—\nhow much less their Dao?\nThe Dao is already a forced designation—\nhow much less the sages themselves?\nIf one seeks sainthood through the mind’s comprehension,\nit is but to chase a name while abandoning reality,\nto pursue trivialities while losing the essential—\nlike sinking in water or entering fire,\nhow could one not perish?\nThus it is said: *“How much less water entering fire, courting destruction.”*\nWater and fire are inherently beneficial to humanity,\nyet their harm comes from humans thrusting themselves into them—\nthis is not the fault of water and fire, is it?\n\nScriptures are the sages’ legacy,\nleft to awaken those not yet awakened—\nyet later learners, enamored of their words,\noblivious to their substance?\nRecognizing the coarse while losing the refined?\nExhausting their intellects,\nconsuming their knowledge,\nstudying tirelessly day and night,\nonly to gain empty discourse,\ntheir intent to surpass others and seek fame and fortune,\nto feign sincerity and practice deceit,\nto extinguish true principle—\nis this not the same as courting destruction?\nIf one can truly learn for oneself,\nand exhaust the principles within scriptures to realize one’s nature,\nwhat more could the sages add?\nIf so, then why abandon the scriptures and histories?\n\nThe Dao of Nature is still—\nthus all things under Heaven are born.\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth is permeating—\nthus Yin and Yang prevail.\nYin and Yang, pushing and yielding,\ngenerate harmonious transformation.\nThe stillness of Nature is the foundation of the Dao.\nMotion produces Heaven and Earth,\ndivides Yin and Yang,\npushing and swaying to generate the Five Phases,\ntransforming all things—\nendless without cessation.\nWho sustains this?\nIt is the Dao of Nature.\nThe *West Ascension Classic* says:\n*“Nature gives birth to the Dao,\nthe Dao gives birth to the One,\nthe One gives birth to the Two,\nthe Two gives birth to the Three,\nthe Three gives birth to all things.”*\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*“The Yijing has the Supreme Ultimate,\nwhich generates the Two Principles,\nthe Two Principles generate the Four Symbols,\nthe Four Symbols generate the Eight Trigrams,\nthe Eight Trigrams determine auspiciousness and inauspiciousness.”*\nWhen the sages speak of this,\ndoes their teaching depend on words?\n\nIndeed, human nature is also like this.\nLet me explain:\nThe *Guan Yinzi* says:\n*“Nature is the heart before its arising.\nBefore the heart’s arising, it is still—\nin harmony with the Dao of Nature.”*\nWhen the heart moves,\nall dharmas arise simultaneously.\nFrom the vast—Heaven and Earth—\nto the minute—motes of dust,\nsquares, circles, straight, and curved—\nall transform and manifest,\nwithout end or limit.\nThis must be self-attested;\nonly then can one exhaust principles and realize nature,\nand complete the task of sagely learning.\nIf self-attestation is even slightly lacking,\nthen there is doubt—\neven the sages cannot help this.\n\nThus the sages know the Dao of Nature cannot be defied,\nand they establish teachings, rites, and laws accordingly.\nThe Dao of utmost stillness\ncannot be measured by calendrical or musical systems.\n*Calendrical* refers to the harmonization of Yin and Yang,\n*Musical* is the art of calculation.\nHow do the sages surpass others?\nThey know that Heaven and Earth have the Dao of Nature,\nhumans have innate Nature,\nand things have their natural functions—\nall cannot be separated.\nThus they set forth teachings, established rites, and created laws,\ntransmitted through the ages,\nto ensure that rulers and subjects, fathers and sons,\nbrothers, husbands, and wives\ndo not lose their proper order,\nthat all things do not lose their natural functions,\nand that all may align with their true nature,\npreserving the Great Harmony—\nnot artificially contrived,\nbut naturally so.\nThe Dao of utmost stillness is the Dao of Nature itself.\nSilent and scentless,\nit cannot be seen with the eyes or heard with the ears—\nonly those with sincere clarity and tacit understanding grasp it.\nHow could calendrical or musical systems measure this?\n\nThere exists a wondrous instrument,\nfrom which all phenomena arise.\nThe Eight Trigrams, the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches,\ndivine and inscrutable mechanisms.\nThe art of Yin and Yang’s mutual victory\nis clearly revealed in the symbols.\nThe *wondrous instrument* is another name for Nature’s Dao,\nfor the Supreme Ultimate,\nfor the human heart—\nZhuangzi called it *self-so-unique*.\nThe Eight Trigrams, Heavenly Stems, Earthly Branches,\nall flow from this wondrous instrument,\nthus it is said:\n*“There exists a wondrous instrument,\nfrom which all phenomena arise.”*\nThe sages renamed and taught this\nso that later learners might govern superficial knowledge\nwhile attaining the root,\nand reverse the flow to return to the origin.\nIf one can observe the Eight Trigrams,\nHeavenly Stems, Earthly Branches,\nand all phenomena,\nwithout forming other perceptions,\nand directly comprehend their essence,\nthen the wondrous instrument is attained.\nOtherwise, if one exhaustively examines\nthe Eight Trigrams, Heavenly Stems, Earthly Branches,\nand their omens,\nbut fails to grasp it,\nthen it is but fortune.\n*Divine and inscrutable mechanisms* refers to the wondrous instrument’s marvelous functions.\nIndeed, the *divine* is the unfathomable interplay of Yin and Yang,\nthe *inscrutable* is what sight and hearing cannot discern—\nhow much more so its mechanisms and depths?\nIt is but an exaltation of the wondrous instrument’s functions,\nso profound and mysterious,\nso difficult to measure or see.»",
