adversity follow their season**\n**The Five Phases**\n**The Dao of Tang and Yu**\n**The Way of Loyalty and Trust**\n**Achieved and heard**\n\n**Six Virtues**\n**Miscellaneous Speeches (1, 2, 3, 4)**\n\n**Laozi (Texts A, B, C) – Text A**\nAbandon sharp intelligence, discard cleverness—\nthe people benefit a hundredfold.\nAbandon cunning, discard profit—\nthieves and robbers vanish.\nAbandon deceit, discard artifice—\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\n\nThree sayings: one is insufficient for judgment.\nSometimes command, sometimes submit to the grain.\n\nPreserve simplicity, reduce private desires.\nThe reason the sea is king of the valleys\nis that it can be below all valleys—\nthus it can be king of the valleys.\n\nWhen the Sage’s virtue is before the people,\nhe acts behind them.\nWhen his virtue is above the people,\nhe speaks below them.\n\nWhen his virtue is above the people,\nthe people do not burden him;\nwhen his virtue is before the people,\nthe people do not harm him.\n\nThe world rejoices in advancing without satiation.\nBecause he does not contend,\nthe world cannot contend with him.\n\nNo guilt is greater than excessive desire,\nno blame is deeper than greedy acquisition,\nno calamity is worse than not knowing sufficiency.\n\nKnowing sufficiency is true sufficiency—\nthis is the enduring sufficiency.\n\nThose who assist rulers with the Dao\ndo not wish to dominate the world with force.\n\nThe good are fruitful without boasting,\nnot seeking strength.\n\nFruitful without arrogance,\nfruitful without pride,\nfruitful without vanity—\nthis is called fruitful without strength.\n\nHis affairs are well-loved.\n\nThe ancient master of the Way\nmust be subtle yet profound,\ndeep beyond recognition—\nthus his conduct is praised:\n\nLike winter crossing a river,\nlike fearing the four neighbors,\nlike treating guests with sternness,\nlike releasing tension,\nlike enduring like simplicity,\nlike enduring like mud.\n\nWho can endure mud and attain stillness\nwill gradually become clear.\nWho can endure stillness and endure\nwill gradually attain life.\n\nPreserving this Dao,\none does not desire excess.\n\nDoing leads to ruin,\ngrasping leads to loss.\n\nThus the Sage does nothing and so does nothing fail;\ndoes not grasp and so does not lose.\n\nIn handling affairs, treat the end as the beginning—\nthis is how nothing fails.\n\nThe Sage desires not to desire,\ndoes not value hard-to-obtain goods,\nteaches without teaching,\ncorrects the people’s errors.\n\nThus the Sage can assist all things in their natural state\nwithout forcing them.\n\nThe Dao is ever non-action—\nif lords and kings can guard it,\nall things will naturally transform.\n\nWhen transformation occurs,\ngovern with nameless simplicity.\n\nThis is also knowing sufficiency—\nknowing stillness,\nall things will naturally settle.\n\nNon-action in action,\nnon-affairs in affairs,\nflavor in flavorlessness.\nThe small and great are easily confused—\nthus difficulties arise.\n\nTherefore the Sage treats difficulty as ease,\nand so never encounters difficulty.\n\nAll know beauty as beauty—\nthis is already ugliness.\nAll know goodness—\nthis is already not-goodness.\n\nThere is non-being generating being,\ndifficulty and ease forming each other,\nlong and short defining each other,\nhigh and low filling each other,\nsounds harmonizing,\nbefore and after following.\n\nThus the Sage dwells in non-action,\npractices speechless teaching.\n\nThings arise without being initiated,\nare done without reliance,\nare completed without possession.\nBecause he does not possess,\nhe does not lose.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless,\nsimplicity though subtle—\nheaven and earth do not dare to serve it.\nIf lords and kings can guard it,\nall things will naturally come as guests.\n\nThe heaven and earth unite,\nand yet overflow with sweetness.\n\nThe people do not command it—\nyet they naturally find harmony and peace.\n\nWhen it begins to shape,\nit has a name.\n\nThe name also has a form,\nand yet one may know where to stop,\nknowing where to stop,\nso as not to err.\n\nBy analogy, the Dao’s **power** in the world\nis like a small valley in relation to the sea.\nThere are things that are formed and completed,\nbefore heaven and earth are born,\nsilent and still,\nstanding alone without alteration—\nthey can be the mother of all things.\n\nNot knowing its name,\nwe call it **Dao**;\nI forcefully name it **Great**.\n\nGreat means **far**,\n**far** means **return**,\n**return** means **reverting**.\n\nHeaven is great,\nearth is great,\n**Dao** is great,\nand the king is also great.\nWithin the realm there are four great **powers**,\nthe king dwells in one of them.\nPeople follow earth,\nearth follows heaven,\nheaven follows **Dao**,\n**Dao** follows its own nature.\n\nThe space between heaven and earth—\nis it like a **gourd** or a **lock**?\n\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever emerging.\n\nTo **ultimate emptiness** is constancy;\nto **central steadfastness** is strength.\n\nAll things are yet forming,\nand yet they await completion.\nThe **Way** of heaven is round and full,\neach returning to its **root**.\n\nIts ease is also its **difficulty**.\n\nBefore its **omens** appear, it is easy to **plan**.\nWhen it is **fragile**, it is easy to **break**.\nWhen it is **precarious**, it is easy to **scatter**.\nAct upon it when it is **yet to exist**.\nGovern it before it is **disordered**.\n\nWhen the **nine layers** are piled high,\nthe **foundation** is laid at the **foot**.\n\nThe wise do not speak of it;\nthose who speak do not know it.\n\nClose the **orifices**,\nshut the **gates**,\nblend its **luster**,\nharmonize with the **dust**,\nbe **obscure** in **action**,\nuntangle its **entanglements**—\nthis is called **Mysterious Unity**.\n\nThus, it cannot be **grasped** as **new**,\nnor can it be **distant**;\nit cannot be **advantageous**,\nnor can it be **harmful**;\nit cannot be **exalted**,\nnor can it be **debased**.\n\nTherefore, it is **honored** by the world.\nTo govern the realm with **rectitude**,\nto wage war with **strategic subtlety**,\nto achieve **non-action** in **undertakings**—\nhow can one **know** its **thusness**?\n\nHeaven has many **taboos**,\nyet the people **rebel** the more.\nWhen the people have many **sharp tools**,\nthe state **flourishes in corruption**.\nWhen people **know** too much of **strange things**,\n**disorder** **arises**.\n\nWhen **laws** are **proliferated**,\n**thieves and bandits** abound.\nThus, the words of the **Sage** say:\n*\"I do nothing, yet the people **prosper** of themselves.\nI act not, yet the people **transform** of themselves.\nI cherish **stillness**, yet the people **align** of themselves.\nI desire not, yet the people **return to simplicity** of themselves.\"*\n\nThose who **embody virtue** deeply\nare like **infant children**:\n**Serpents and venomous beasts** do not **strike** them,\n**fierce birds and wild beasts** do not **claw** them,\ntheir **bones are weak**, their **muscles supple**, yet they are **strong**.\nThey do not **know** the **union** of male and female,\nyet their **essence** is **perfect**.\nThey **endure** the day without **weariness**,\ntheir **harmony** is **complete**—\nthis is called **constant**.\n**Knowing harmony** is called **clarity**.\n\n**Excessive growth** is called **omen**,\n**directing the mind** is called **strength**,\n**things** **grow old** when they are **vigorous**—\nthis is called **not the Way**.\n\nWhich is **closer**—**name** or **self**?\nWhich is **more**—**self** or **wealth**?\nWhich is **more harmful**—**gain** or **loss**?\n**Excessive love** leads to **great expenditure**,\n**excessive hoarding** leads to **great loss**.\n\nThus, **knowing sufficiency** brings no **humiliation**,\n**knowing restraint** brings no **danger**,\nand this can **endure**.\n\n**Return** is the **movement** of the **Way**.\n**Weakness** is the **application** of the **Way**.\n\nAll things under heaven **arise** from **being**,\n**being** from **non-being**.\n**Overflowing** and **filling** it,\nit is not as good as **halted**.\n**Rushing** and **herding** it,\nit cannot be **long preserved**.\n\n**Gold and jade** **fill** the **hall**,\nyet none can **guard** them.\n**Wealth and arrogance** **invite** **calamity**.\n**Achievement** **completed**, **withdraw**—\nthis is the **Way** of Heaven.\n\nTo govern the people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.\n\nFor it is frugality that brings early **virtue/power**,\nand it is frugality that brings early **preparedness**—this is what is called...\nIf one does not **master** it, one cannot **know** its **constancy**,\ncannot **know** that its **constancy** can **yield** a **state**.\nThe **mother** of a **state** can **endure** long,\nthis is the **Way** of **long endurance**.\n\nThe **scholar** daily **gains**,\nthe **practitioner** of the **Dao/Way** daily **loses**.\nTo **lose** and yet **lose**,\nuntil **non-action** is achieved—\n**non-action** achieved, yet **non-action** is not **action**.\n\n**Ceasing** learning, **no** **worry**—\nhow far is this from **rebuke**?\n**Good** and **evil**—\nhow far apart are they?\n\nWhat people **fear**, one must not fail to **fear**.\nPeople **honor** and **humiliate** like **alarm**.\nThey **value** great **calamity** like the **self**.\n\nWhat is called **honor** and **humiliation**?\n**Honor** is the **lowly**.\nTo **gain** it is like **alarm**,\nto **lose** it is like **alarm**—\nthis is called **honor** and **humiliation** as **alarm**.\n\nWhat is **self**?\nBecause of my **self**, I have great **calamity**.\nIf I **lose** my **self**,\nthen perhaps I can **do**...\n**entrust** the **world**,\nor perhaps I can **entrust** the **world**.\n\n**Love** the **world** with the **self**,\nhow can one **entrust** the **world**?\n\nThe **superior person** hears the **Dao/Way** and **diligently** practices within it.\nThe **middle person** hears the **Dao/Way**,\nas if hearing, as if not hearing.\nThe **inferior person** hears the **Dao/Way** and **greatly laughs** at it.\nIf one does not **greatly laugh**,\nit is not sufficient to be the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThus, the **proverb** says:\nClarify the **Dao/Way** like **water**,\n**level** the **Dao/Way** like **mud**,\n**retreat** the **Dao/Way** like **returning**.\n\n**High virtue/power** is like a **valley**,\n**great whiteness** is like **defilement**,\n**broad virtue/power** is like **insufficiency**,\n**establishing virtue/power** is like **simplicity**,\n**true virtue/power** is like **joy**.\n\nThe **great square** has no **corners**,\nthe **great vessel** is **finished**,\nthe **great sound** is **pure**,\nHeaven’s **symbol** has no **form**,\nthe **Dao/Way**...\n\n**Close** its **door**,\n**seal** its **orifice**,\nand **endure** a lifetime without **weariness**.\n**Open** its **orifice**,\n**seal** its **affairs**,\nand **endure** a lifetime without **weariness**.\n**Great completion** is like **deficiency**,\nits **use** is **unexhausted**.\n**Great fullness** is like a **cup**,\nits **use** is **unending**.\n**Great skill** is like **clumsiness**,\n**great completion** is like **crookedness**,\n**great straightness** is like **bending**.\n\n**Dryness** **overcomes** **blue-green**,\n**clarity** **overcomes** **heat**,\n**stillness** **settles** the **world**.\n\nThe **well-built** does not **uproot**,\nthe **well-made** does not **slip**,\ntheir descendants **sacrifice** without **failure**.\n\n**Cultivate** the **self**, its **virtue/power** becomes **true**.\n**Cultivate** the **family**, its **virtue/power** has **surplus**.\n**Cultivate** the **neighborhood**, its **virtue/power** **endures**.\n**Cultivate** the **state**, its **virtue/power** **abounds**.\n**Cultivate** the **world**...\n\n**Observe** the **neighborhood** from the **neighborhood**,\n**observe** the **state** from the **state**,\n**observe** the **world** from the **world**.\nHow can I **know** the **Heaven**...\n\n---\n**Section 丙**\n\nThe **great** and **lowly** **know** it,\nits **sequence** is **close** and **esteemed**,\nits **sequence** is **feared**,\nits **sequence** is **despised**.\n\n**Trust** is insufficient, **security** has **non-trust**.\nYet how **precious** is **speech**!\n\n**Completed** affairs **achieve** **success**,\nyet the **hundred families** say, *\"It was I who did it.\"*\n\n**Ancient** **great Dao/Way** **decayed**,\nhow could there be **ren** and **righteousness**?\nThe **six kinships** are **unharmonious**,\nhow could there be **filial piety** and **compassion**?\nThe **state** and **family** are **confused**,\nhow could there be **loyal ministers**?\n\n**Hold** the **great symbol**,\nthe **world** **follows**.\n**Follow** without **harm**,\nhow **level** is the **great**!\n\n**Joy** and

**hear**,\nyet it cannot be **exhausted**.\n\nThe **gentleman** at **rest** **values** the **left**,\n**using arms** **values** the **right**.\nThus it is said:\n**Warfare**...\n**obtain** it and **use** it.\n**Not using** is **best**,\n**not delighting** in it.\nTo **delight** in it,\nis to **rejoice** in killing people.\n\nHe who **delights** in **killing** people\n**achieves** his **ambition** in the **world**.\n\nAt **rest**, **ancient** **Dao/Way** **values** the **left**,\nat **death**, **values** the **right**.\n\nThus it is said:\n**The commander** **stands** on the **left**,\n**the general** **stands** on the **right**,\nspeaking of **establishing** the **rites** of **mourning**.\n\n**Ancient** **Dao/Way** **executes** **punishment**,\nthen **endows** them with

**are no** **defeated** **matters** **to rejoice** over.\nMen’s **defeat** **is constant** at the **moment** of **near completion**.\n\nThus it is said:\n**People** **desire** what they **do not

The heart, however, is the one who delights in **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). Though all these members have their delights, why are the six considered servants of the heart? Because the heart is noble. Even if all the world’s beautiful sounds and colors are present, if they are not **righteous** (义), then the ears will not listen and the eyes will not gaze upon them. Even if all the world’s beautiful odors and flavors are present, if they are not **righteous** (义), then the nose will not seek them and the mouth will not eat them. If one does not give way to elders and superiors while in their presence, if it is not **righteous** (义), then one will not do so. Why not? Because the weak cannot overcome the strong, the lowly cannot overcome the noble—how could they? Thus, it is said that they are the heart’s servants. The six members—ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet—are the **smaller aspects** (小者) of a person’s nature; the heart is the **greater aspect** (大者) of a person’s nature, hence it is called the **lord** (君). *\"The heart says ‘Yes,’ none dare not refuse ‘Yes,’\"* when the heart says *\"Yes\"* (唯), the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet all respond in harmony with sounds, forms, colors, and gestures—this is why none dare not *\"Yes\"* (唯). The same applies to *\"Affirm\"* (诺) and *\"Retreat\"* (后). *\"The heart says ‘Deep’ or ‘Shallow,’ none dare not refuse ‘Deep’ or ‘Shallow,’\"* for *\"Deep\"* (深) means extreme, and *\"Shallow\"* (浅) means not extreme. There is a **Dao/Way** (道) to their depth and shallowness. Thus, if a father calls, the mouth will reject food and the hands will cast aside their work, yet one will still *\"Yes\"* (唯) without *\"Affirming\"* (诺), and flee without haste—this is why none dare not refuse *\"Deep\"* (深). But toward one’s elder brother, it is not so extreme—this is why none dare not refuse *\"Shallow\"* (浅). *\"Harmonized, they are unified,\"* harmony means the smaller aspects are content without troubling the heart, harmonized with **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). **Virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义) are the heart’s essence. *Unified* means in accord with the heart, like a **lord** (君) governing his subjects, unified in **virtue** (仁). **Virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义) are the heart’s essence—unified, then it is **good** (善).\n\n**[Scripture 26]** To see and know is called *\"Advance\"* (进). To infer and know is called *\"Advance\"* (进). To examine and know is called *\"Advance\"* (进). To intuit and know is **heavenly** (天). *\"The Heavenly Lord esteems you, do not waver your heart,\"* this is what is meant.\n\n**[Explanation 26]** *\"To see and know is called ‘Advance’\"* (进)—if one does not see, then one cannot know, and knowing is *\"Advance\"* (进). To see is to compare. *\"Heaven watches over us below, and our fate has already been gathered\"*—this means heaven watches over us from below, gathering our fate. Following the nature of grasses and trees, there is life, yet no sense of **good** (好) or **evil** (恶). Following the nature of birds and beasts, there is a sense of **good** (好) and **evil** (恶), yet no **virtue** (礼) or **righteousness** (义). Following human nature, one clearly knows that humans delight in **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). If one does not follow the way one receives one’s fate, then following it will yield knowledge—this is to have seen it already. Thus, by seeing the nature of all things and knowing that only humans possess **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义), one *\"Advances\"* (进). *\"The King Wen was above, and shone brightly upon heaven,\"* this is what is meant. King Wen observed the nature of ears and eyes and knew they delighted in sounds and colors; he observed the nature of nose and mouth and knew they delighted in odors and flavors; he observed the nature of hands and feet and knew they delighted in ease and comfort; he observed the nature of the heart and clearly knew it delighted in **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). Thus, he held fast to it without losing it, and drew near without departing from it, so he stood out clearly before heaven, and his influence was evident throughout the world—this was no other than to see. Thus, by observing human nature and knowing that nothing is nobler than **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义), one *\"Advances\"* (进). *\"To infer and know is called ‘Advance’\"* (进)—if one does not infer, then one cannot know, and knowing is *\"Advance\"* (进). To infer is like comparing a hill to a mountain: the reason one does not name the hill as the mountain is because it does not accumulate. Shun had **virtue** (仁), and I also have **virtue** (仁), yet my **virtue** (仁) is not like Shun’s **virtue** (仁)—this is because it does not accumulate. Shun had **righteousness** (义), and I also have **righteousness** (义), yet my **righteousness** (义) is not like Shun’s **righteousness** (义)—this is because it does not accumulate. By comparing and inferring, one knows why one does not match Shun—this is *\"Advance\"* (进). *\"To understand and know is called ‘Advance’\"* (进)—if one does not understand, then one cannot know, and knowing is *\"Advance\"* (进). To understand is to draw an analogy from one’s lesser delights to one’s greater delights. *\"The graceful and elegant virtuous woman, I dream of her and seek her.\"* This refers to **delight in beauty** (色). *\"Seeking her, I do not find her; dreaming of her, I ponder her attire.\"* This speaks of one’s **urgency** (急). *\"How joyous and carefree she is, turning and tossing in her sleep.\"* This speaks of one’s **extreme urgency** (甚急). If it is so urgent, then why does one not act upon it even when it involves one’s parents? It is clear that one would not do so for fear of death. Why does one not act upon it even when it involves one’s brothers? One would not do so either. Why does one not act upon it even when it involves one’s fellow countrymen? One would not do so either. To fear one’s father and elder brother, and to fear others’ killing—this is **virtue** (礼). From **delight in beauty** (色) to understanding **virtue** (礼), one *\"Advances\"* (进). *\"To intuit and know is called ‘heavenly’\"* (天)—intuition is the **inherent virtue** (赉) of numbers. Only those who possess the **heavenly power** (天德) can intuit and know. *\"The Heavenly Lord watches over you, do not waver your heart.\"* The Heavenly Lord watches over you—this is intuition by the mouth; do not waver your heart—this is intuition by all together.\n\n**[Scripture 27]** When heaven bestows upon its person, it is **heavenly** (天). When its person bestows upon others, it is **familiar** (狎). (When its person bestows upon others, without attaining its person, it is not the **Dao/Way** (法).)\n\n**[Explanation 27]** *\"When heaven bestows upon its person, it is heavenly\"*—when heaven bestows upon its person, it is like King Wen. *\"When its person bestows upon others\"*—this is like King Wen’s bestowal upon **Fang Yao** (闳夭) and **San Yi Sheng** (散宜生). *\"When its person bestows upon others, without attaining its person, it is not the Dao/Way\"* (法).*\n\n「*\"What is bestowed upon is not like those who are as virtuous as San Yi Sheng and Fang Yao, then it is not the Dao/Way.*\n\n**[Scripture 28]** Those who hear the Dao/Way and take delight are lovers of *ren* (仁). Those who hear the Dao/Way and stand in awe are lovers of *yi* (義). Those who hear the Dao/Way and are reverent are lovers of *li* (禮). Those who hear the Dao/Way and rejoice are those of virtue (德).\n\n**[Explanation 28]** *\"Those who hear the Way of the Noble and take delight are lovers of ren.\"* The Dao/Way is the Heavenly Dao/Way; those who love *ren* hear the Way of the Noble and apply it to their own *ren*, thus they take delight. Delight is its manifestation. *\"Those who hear the Way of the Noble and stand in awe are lovers of yi.\"* Those who love *yi* hear the Way of the Noble and apply it to their own *yi*, thus they stand in awe. Awe is its manifestation. *\"Those who hear the Dao/Way and are reverent are lovers of li.\"* Those who love *li* hear the Dao/Way and apply it to their own *li*, thus they are reverent. Reverence is its manifestation. *\"Those who hear the Dao/Way and rejoice are those of virtue.\"* The Dao/Way is the Heavenly Dao/Way; those who love virtue hear the Way of the Noble and unify the five [elements] into one, thus they rejoice. Joy is harmony, and harmony is virtue.\n\n**Appendix: *De Sheng* (德聖)**\nWhen the four [virtues] are complete, a benevolent heart arises. When the four [virtues] manifest, sacred *qi* (氣) awakens. When the five [elements] manifest, a virtuous heart arises. Harmony is called virtue; its essence is called One.\n\nIts love is called Heaven. Those who possess it are called Noble Ones. The five are one.\n\n---\nThe pure and impure dwell in virtue (德之居). Virtue is the abyss of purity and impurity. When the body is attuned and the spirit transcends, it is called *Xuan Tong* (玄同).\n\nThe *sheng* (聖) is manifestly so, nightly so, and spreads fully across the world. *Sheng* is Heaven’s knowing. To know the Dao/Way of others is knowledge; to know the Heavenly Dao/Way is *sheng*. *Sheng* is sound; *sheng* is knowing. *Sheng*’s knowing knows Heaven. Its deeds transform the wild, and thus it is called *sheng*—taking from sound, for knowing Heaven has sound.\n\nTo know that it does not transform is wisdom; to transform without knowing is virtue; to transform and know it is *zhu* (叕).\n\nThe Dao/Way, virtue, One, Heaven, and the Noble—when their paths are blocked, it is virtue; when they act, it is the Dao/Way. Their excellence is complete—thus it is said: *\"The vigorous arises!\"*\n\n---\nThe arrival of the virtuous... The virtuous, through their essence, attain the fundamental and the refined—how can they act? Broad... then... their vision is clear, their hearing sharp, yet they do not act... their hands and feet are idle, yet they do not act... their mouths can measure and act... those who measure and act... know... seated, forgetting retreat, their clarity and wisdom depart, their knowing surpasses themselves, and they align with the Supreme...\n\n---\nThose of noble lineage are said to receive [virtue] with varying depth. Their goodness is the same, yet later generations surpass it, ascending ever higher. What they receive, they receive from what exists—what exists cannot be sought or obtained.\n\n---」\n\n[1] The silk manuscript arranges this passage in the order: *ren* (benevolence), *zhi* (wisdom), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (propriety), *sheng* (sageliness)—differing from the order in the bamboo slips.\n\n[2] Supplemented from the silk manuscript text.\n\n[3] The silk manuscript reads: *\"light.\"*\n\n[4] The silk manuscript reads: *\"refined and enduring.\"*\n\n[5] The silk manuscript renders these two lines as: *\"If thought is not refined and enduring, one cannot delight.\"*\n\n[6] The silk manuscript supplements these lines as: *\"When warm, one perceives the Dao of the noble; perceiving the Dao of the noble, one has no sorrow; without sorrow, one’s complexion is like jade.\"* **Jade-like complexion** (*yùsè*), as in *Xúnzǐ’s \"Fǎxíng\"*:\n*\"Confucius said: … Jade is what the noble compares their virtue to.

When struck, its sound is clear and resonant, far-reaching, and its resonance lingers—this is *cí* (eloquence).

Yu**\n\nThe Dao of the Tang and Yu—\nIt was passed down through abdication, not transmitted.\nThe kingship of Yao and Shun—\nThey benefited the realm yet did not hoard it.\nAbdication without transmission—\nThis was the utmost of sageliness.\nBenefiting the realm yet not hoarding—\nThis was the pinnacle of virtue.\nThus, the ancient sages and virtuous ones were such.\n\nWhen impoverished, they did not covet;\nWhen dying, they did not hoard—\nThis was the fullness of virtue.\nFirst rectify oneself,\nThen rectify the world—\nThis was the completeness of the Sage’s Way.\nThus, the Dao of the Tang and Yu was abdication.\n\nThe Sage, above, served Heaven,\nTeaching the people reverence;\nBelow, served Earth,\nTeaching the people renewal [affection];\nIn season, served the mountains and rivers,\nTeaching the people respect;\nWith renewal, served the ancestral temples,\nTeaching the people filiality;\nIn the Great Academy, the Son of Heaven honored the aged by rank,\nTeaching the people fraternal order.\nThe former sages and latter sages—\nExamining the latter to verify the former—\nThis taught the people the Way of great harmony.\n\nThe conduct of Yao and Shun:\nLoving the kin, honoring the worthy.\nLoving the kin, hence filiality;\nHonoring the worthy, hence abdication.\nThe method of filiality: loving all under Heaven’s people.\nThe transmission of abdication: no hidden virtue in the age.\nFiliality—\nThis was the crown of virtue.\nAbdication—\nThis was the utmost of righteousness.\nThe Six Emperors arose in antiquity,\nAll from this.\n\nLoving the kin while neglecting the worthy—\nVirtue yet not righteousness.\nHonoring the worthy while abandoning the kin—\nRighteousness yet not virtue.\n\nIn ancient times, Yu of Pei diligently served his blind father,\nAnd thus was crowned with filiality;\nHe faithfully served Emperor Yao,\nAnd thus was crowned as a loyal subject.\nLoving the kin and honoring the worthy—\nThis was Yu of Pei.\n\nYu tamed the floods,\nYi tamed fire,\nHou Ji cultivated the soil,\nSufficient for nourishing life.\nOnly by conforming to the natural inclinations of flesh and qi,\nNurturing the rectitude of life and fate,\nAccepting one’s lot without dying young,\nNurturing life without harm—\nThose who knew the governance of all under Heaven\nCould thus abdicate the realm.\n\nIn ancient times, when Yao and Shun met:\nHearing of Shun’s filiality, [Yao] knew he could nourish the aged of all under Heaven;\nHearing of Shun’s fraternal love, [Yao] knew he could serve the elders of all under Heaven;\nHearing of Shun’s kindness to his brother [and the missing characters]—[Yao] knew he could rule the people.\nThus, as a blind and lame son,\nHis filiality was profound;\nAs Yao’s minister,\nHis loyalty was profound;\nWhen Yao abdicated the realm and entrusted it to him,\nHe ruled all under Heaven from the south-facing throne—\nHis kingship was profound.\nThus, Yao’s abdication to Shun was such.\n\nIn ancient times, the Sage at twenty was crowned,\nAt thirty established his household,\nAt fifty governed all under Heaven,\nAt seventy retired from office—\nHis limbs weary, his hearing and sight declining—\nHe abdicated the realm and entrusted it to the worthy,\nWithdrawing to nurture his life.\nThus, it is known that he did not hoard.\n\nThe *Yu Odes* say:\n*“The great brightness does not emerge,\nAll things fall into darkness.\nWhen the Sage is not above,\nAll under Heaven must decay.”*\n\nAt the height of governance, the unworthy are nurtured.\nAt the height of chaos, the worthy are exterminated.\nThe virtuous advance through this:\nClarifying rites, revering guardianship, delighting in modesty—\nThis is the teaching of the people.\n\nGao Yao internally implemented the Five Punishments,\nExternally deployed arms—\nLight crimes, strict laws—\nYu relied on coercion, Xia on force—\nTo subdue the unyielding.\nLoving yet征 them—\nThis was the governance of Yu and Xia.\nAbdication without transmission was everlasting—\nThis began with Xia.\n\nIn ancient times, Yao was born as Son of Heaven and held the realm.\nSage by fate, virtuous by timing—\nHe never encountered the worthy.\nThough he aligned with the great age,\nDivine clarity would follow,\nHeaven and Earth would aid him.\nEven if the virtuous and sage were present,\nThe time could not be matched.\n\nIn ancient times, Shun dwelled in humble thatch yet was not sorrowful,\nRuled as Son of Heaven yet was not arrogant.\nDwelling in humble thatch yet not sorrowful—\nThis was knowing one’s fate.\nRuled as Son of Heaven yet not arrogant—\nThis was not monopolizing.\nSeeking the rise of the great person—\nThis was beauty.\n\nNow, those who wear the virtue of the Sage—\nAfter a few years, they do not wear it;\nAs rulers and people, they are not arrogant;\nConcluding kingship over all under Heaven, they have no doubt.\nWhile in low station, they do not deem the commoner as insignificant;\nWhen holding the realm, they do not deem the realm as weighty.\nHolding the realm cannot increase [their virtue],\nLosing the realm cannot diminish it.\nThe utmost of virtue—\nBenefiting the realm yet not hoarding.\nAbdication—\nThis is the highest virtue bestowing upon the worthy.\n\nThe highest virtue—when the realm has a ruler, the age is enlightened;\nTo entrust the worthy—when the people rise and emulate, transforming in the Dao.\n\nTo transform the people without abdication—never has existed since the birth of humankind.\nThus it is.\n\nThe Dao of loyalty and trust—\nNo deception, no betrayal: this is the utmost loyalty.\nNo deceit, no ignorance: this is the utmost trust.\nWhen loyalty gathers, one becomes approachable;\nWhen trust gathers, one becomes reviled.\nLoyalty and trust gathered yet the people do not trust—never has existed.\n\nUtmost loyalty like earth—transforming all yet without boasting;\nUtmost trust like the seasons—all things arrive yet without constraint.\nThe loyal person knows no deception;\nThe trustworthy person knows no breach.\nThe noble one thus—\nDoes not deceive the living, does not betray the dead.\nEnduring for ages without change—this is the utmost loyalty.\nMolding yet revealing constancy—this is the utmost trust.\nUtmost loyalty knows no deception;\nUtmost trust knows no breach—\nThis is what is spoken of.\n\nGreat loyalty does not seek praise;\nGreat trust does not demand reciprocity.\nNot seeking praise yet sufficient to nourish—this is earth.\nNot demanding reciprocity yet naturally encountered—this is heaven.\nTo resemble heaven and earth—\nThis is what loyalty and trust are spoken of.\n\nEmpty promises, yet actions do not follow—\nThe noble one does not speak thus;\nCold-hearted yet feigning closeness—\nThe noble one does not act thus.\nThus, to act and compete for the people’s favor—\nThe noble one does not follow this path.\nThese three things—\nThe loyal do not create them, the trustworthy do not commit them.\n\nThe Dao of loyalty—\nAll craftsmen do not weary, yet all are nourished.\nThe Dao of trust—\nAll things flourish, yet all virtues stand.\nThe noble one applies loyalty—\nThus love and attachment gather;\nTheir words are trustworthy—\nThus they are sincere and received.\n\nLoyalty is the substance of virtue;\nTrust is the expectation of righteousness.\nThus, the ancient way of conducting [governance]—\nWas thus.\n\nChéng Zhī heard this and said:\nThe ancients governing the people—\nSought it in themselves as constant.\nIf actions are untrustworthy, commands are not obeyed;\nIf trust does not take root, words are not rejoiced in.\nIf the people do not obey the ruler’s commands,\nDo not trust their words,\nYet still contain virtue—never has existed.\n\nThus, when the noble one governs the people—\nThey embody goodness to lead them,\nWith reverence and caution to guard them,\nAnd where they stand, others follow.\nIf the ruler embodies goodness,\nThe people will surpass it.\nThe ruler in ceremonial cap and robes standing at the eastern stair—\nAll in the hall are overwhelmed with respect.\nThe ruler in mourning dress seated in position—\nAll in the hall are overwhelmed with sorrow.\nThe ruler in helmet and armor standing in the army—\nAll in the ranks are overwhelmed with courage.\nIf the ruler sets the example,\nThe people will rarely fail to follow.\n\nYet, their endurance is not profound,\nTheir weight is not great.\nThus, the noble one’s demands upon themselves are deep.\nTo seek not at the root yet attack at the branches—\nIt cannot be attained.\nThus, the noble one values speech—\nNot from those who follow superficial trends,\nBut from those who exhaust the source and return to the root.\nIf one does not follow its origin,\nDoes not return to its root,\nNothing can be attained.\nThe ruler who enjoys success yet does not honor the root—\nTheir work will not be completed.\n\nThe farmer toils for food—\nIf they do not labor diligently, the granaries will be insufficient.\nThe scholar speaks grandly yet their words are not acted upon—\nTheir reputation will not be earned.\nThus, the noble one values speech—\nNot from those who follow superficial trends,\nBut from those who exhaust speech and return to the root.\nIf one does not follow its origin,\nDoes not return to its root,\nEven if forced, it will not enter.\n\nIf the ruler does not act according to the Dao,\nThe people’s following will be difficult.\nThus, the people can be respectfully guided,\nYet cannot be coerced;\nCan be controlled,\nYet cannot be led like cattle.\nThus, the noble one does not value trivial things,\nBut values harmony with the people.\nIn order and rank, they advance—\nThus the people desire their advancement to succeed.\nIn wealth yet humility, they are lowly—\nThus the people desire their wealth to grow.\nIn nobility yet able to yield—\nThus the people desire their nobility to ascend.\nTo reverse this Dao—\nThe people will surely repay with equal measure,\nHow can one not be cautious?\n\nThus, the noble one’s repayments are few,\nTheir demands are not distant—\nPrivately reflecting upon themselves,\nOne can know others.\nThus, to desire the people’s love—\nOne must first love the people;\nTo desire the people’s respect—\nOne must first respect the people.\nThus, wisdom in seeking is not hasty—\nTheir distance from others is not great.\nCourage in acting is not resolute—\nTheir doubts will not go far.\nThus, all things lie in haste.\n\nThe *Jun Si* says: **\"Only the great and single-minded extol virtue\"**—what does this mean? It speaks of haste.\n\nThe noble one says: To hasten in action yet not hasten—none can fathom its depth. To urge them to completion, to strengthen their craft; to reiterate with diligence, to refine their words—who among the people would not follow? When it manifests within and expresses outwardly, its sincerity is fixed—who among the people would not believe?\n\nThus, the constant duty of the superior is to be trusted by the multitude.\nThe *Ming* says: **\"Faithful teacher, completing virtue\"**—what does this mean? It says that trust in the multitude can complete virtue.\n\nThe nature of the Sage and that of the common person—at birth, none lack aspiration. When nurtured, they remain the same. Though they may not naturally delight in the Way of goodness, repeated practice makes it so. When their breadth and depth grow vast, the Sage cannot be surpassed or rivaled. This is why the people all have innate nature, yet the Sage cannot be emulated.\n\nThe *Jun Si* says: **\"Support these two, let no harmony be in sound\"**—words that displease the Dao. The noble one says: Only what is constant can endure; to persist is difficult.\n\n**\"A withered tree for three years—it need not be a banner\"**—this speaks of *yín* (vigilance). Thus, the noble one values *yín*.\n\nHeaven bestows great principles to order human relationships. It establishes the duty of ruler and subject, marks the bond of parent and child, and distinguishes the roles of husband and wife. Thus, the petty man disrupts Heaven’s order and defies the great Dao, while the noble one governs human relationships to align with Heaven’s virtue.\n\nThe *Da Yu* says: **\"My virtue dwells in Heaven’s heart\"**—what does this mean? It says that my virtue resides in Heaven’s heart. Thus, the noble one, even at the hearth, yields yet loves the young; in the court, yields yet occupies low rank. His dwelling is not distant.\n\nThe petty man does not repay kindness with kindness; the noble one does not repay favor with favor. In a river crossing, the first to board is not as secure as the last. In speech, the one who shouts first is not as triumphant as the one who yields. The noble one says: If one sincerely pardons mistakes, the first to err is absolved, and those who follow are trusted.\n\nOnly the noble one’s Dao can be sought near, not borrowed far. In ancient times, the noble one said, **\"The Sage’s virtue is Heaven’s\"**—what does this mean? It says: Be cautious in seeking within oneself, and thus one can attain harmony with Heaven’s order.\n\nThe *Kang Inscript* says: **\"Do not return nor clash—King Wen established punishments, crimes without pardon\"**—what does this mean? It says that those who do not defy great principles find no heavier model than King Wen’s. Thus, the noble one reverently upholds the six ranks to serve Heaven’s order.\n\nTo honor virtue and righteousness, to clarify human relationships—thus one can be a ruler. To abandon wrath and excess, to reform arrogance and victory—this is the duty of those in high station.\n\nRewards and punishments are the foundation of calamity and blessing; some precede them. Titles and rank are what confirm their legitimacy. Military expeditions are what attack; punishments are what restrain; executions are what eliminate harm. Without the proper path, they cannot be enacted.\n\nRenewal is what makes kinship dear; righteousness is what makes it honored; loyalty is what makes it trusted; learning is what makes it beneficial; teaching is what makes it orderly. Teaching is not altering the Dao; it is guiding. Learning is not changing relationships; it is self-cultivation.\n\nYu governed his people with human principles; Jie乱 his people with human principles. Jie did not first alter Yu’s people before bringing chaos; Tang did not first alter Jie’s people before bringing order. The Sage’s governance of the people is the people’s own way. Yu’s control of the waters was the water’s own way. Zao Fu’s driving of horses was the horse’s own way. Xi He’s cultivation of the land was the land’s own way. None lack their own way—human principles are the nearest.\n\nThus, the noble one prioritizes human principles. The discerning emerge to know themselves. Knowing oneself is to know others; knowing others is to know fate; knowing fate is to know the Dao; knowing the Dao is to know action.\n\nFrom ritual, one knows music; from music, one knows sorrow. There are those who know themselves yet do not know fate, none who know fate yet do not know themselves. There are those who know ritual yet do not know music, none who know music yet do not know ritual.\n\nTo take what is good—people will follow, and this is excellence. To walk this measure, only then can one surpass it. To follow constancy, one is steadfast; to examine subtleties, one avoids deviation; to take no sides, one incurs no resentment; to value thought—[illegible].\n\nThings have their proper roles; they are not within teaching’s reach. To teach governance, not the people—governance will not be enacted. Thus, even among these things, what is profound can be taught yet not doubted. What can be taught yet cannot guide the people—then the people cannot be restrained.\n\nTo honor ren, cherish loyalty, respect solemnity, and return to ritual—when practiced without contradiction, the heart is nurtured in filial piety. Loyalty and trust grow daily without self-awareness.\n\nThe people can be led by the Dao, not made to know it. The people can be guided, not forced. Jie did not assume his people would necessarily rebel, yet they did. What is received but not attained can be followed yet not surpassed.\n\nThe ruler of the people restores ritual governance; the people eliminate harm and labor—this is the path of toil. To govern a state without ritual is like [illegible] without [illegible]. Can the people delight in what is not ritual? This is the petty man.\n\nThe Way of governance without *ren* yet the people obey—this age is chaotic indeed.\n\nTo govern the people is not merely to restore life, but to ensure their desires do not harm *yi* (rightness). To guide the people with love is kindness; to guide them without love is enmity.\n\nThe people may be shaped in five ways and made to contend in tens, but only through hundreds will they submit. The virtuous will make the people wealthy, yet wealth does not guarantee harmony. Without harmony, there is no peace; without peace, no joy.\n\nThe virtuous will make the people numerous, yet numbers do not guarantee governance. Without governance, there is no order; without order, no tranquility.\n\nThus, those who rule must first teach and guide. Teach with *li* (ritual), and the people will grow strong. Teach with music, and the people will not quarrel or vie for favor. Teach with eloquence, and the people will grow skilled yet forget their worth. Teach with arts, and the people will vie in the wilds. Teach with craft, and the people will grow stingy. Teach with words, and the people will sigh with distrust. Teach with deeds, and the people will exhaust their strength in pursuit of profit. Teach with stratagem, and the people will grow licentious and benighted, abandoning *li* and renouncing *ren*.\n\nLead the people with virtue, and they will strive for goodness.\n\n---\n*(The ruler, in governance, may debate, deliberate, act from principle, or set examples from without. He must classify these methods. All actions must align with the people’s hearts, for the people’s hearts are constant, and their enduring nature must be sought. Emphasize *yi* and gather principle—this is the essence of this chapter.)*\n\nThose who governed in antiquity led the people only through virtue. Virtue spreads swiftly, like a relay of commands at a post station. Its burden is light, yet its exchange is unnoticed—when lost, it vanishes. Virtue is nothing greater than *li* and music. Govern with harmony and sorrow, and the people cannot be deceived. To reverse this is to err.\n\nPunishments do not reach the noble; *li* does not reach the petty. Aid those who return, and the people’s talents flourish; act without timing, and there is no encouragement.\n\nWithout love, there is no closeness; without trust, there is no affection; without reliance, there is no authority; without loyalty, there is no trust; without courage, there is no return to virtue.\n\nBlame them, and the people will submit; correct them, and the people will not be stingy; respect them, and the people will not grieve.\n\nEquality is insufficient for just governance; parity is insufficient for stability; courage is insufficient to overawe the masses; breadth is insufficient to know goodness; decisiveness is insufficient to discern *ren*; killing is insufficient to conquer the people.\n\nWhen inferiors serve superiors, they follow not their commands but their actions. If the superior loves something, the inferior will love it more.\n\nThus, virtue can be easily bestowed, and actions can be redirected. There are cases where small benefits turn to great harm, and cases where small harms turn to great benefit.\n\n---\n*(Measure these actions, and only then can they be transcended.)*\n\nThus, the ruler may debate, deliberate, act from principle, or set examples from without. He must classify these methods. All actions must align with the people’s hearts, for the people’s hearts are constant, and their enduring nature must be sought. Emphasize *yi* and gather principle—this is the essence of this chapter.\n\n---\nNature arises from *ming* (fate). Though all have nature, the heart lacks resolve unless acted upon by things, pleased by things, and habituated by things. The *qi* of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—this is nature. When expressed outwardly, it is shaped by things.\n\nNature arises from *ming*; *ming* descends from Heaven. The Dao begins with emotion; emotion arises from nature. The beginning is close to emotion; the end is close to *yi*.\n\nThose who know emotion can express it; those who know *yi* can internalize it. Likes and dislikes are nature; what is liked or disliked are things. Goodness and evil are nature; what is good or evil are circumstances.\n\nNature is the master, yet things shape it. Metal and stone, when struck, produce sound; yet without striking, they remain silent. Though people have nature, the heart remains inactive unless acted upon. The heart has resolve—nothing is impossible—but nature cannot act alone, just as the mouth cannot speak alone.\n\nOxen are born to grow long; geese are born to stretch their necks—this is their nature. In humans, learning shapes them. All things differ—rigidity is their foundation, shaped by rigidity; gentleness is their constraint, shaped by gentleness.\n\nWithin the Four Seas, nature is one. Yet their uses differ, shaped by teaching.\n\nNature may be stirred, resisted, mingled, disciplined, drawn out, nurtured, or cultivated. What stirs nature are things; what resists it is pleasure; what mingles it is artifice; what disciplines it is *yi*; what draws it out is circumstance; what nurtures it is habit; what cultivates it is the Dao.\n\nWhat is seen is called things; what pleases is called delight; the power of things is called circumstance; deliberate action is called artifice. *Yi* is the gathering of all goodness. Habit is the means to cultivate nature. The Dao is the Way of all things.\n\nThe Dao has four methods, but only human cultivation is truly the Dao. The other three are merely its application.\n\nThe *Shijing* (Classic of Poetry), *Shujing* (Classic of Documents), *Liji* (Classic of Rites), and music—all originated from humanity. *Poetry* was composed for a purpose; *Documents* were spoken for a purpose; *Rites* and *Music* were enacted for a purpose.\n\nThe sages compared their kinds, deliberated their meanings, observed their sequence, and traced their origins backward. They examined their *yi*, regulated their measures, ordered their emotions, and only then applied them to teaching.\n\nTeaching is the means by which virtue is cultivated within.\n\nRites arise from emotions, sometimes stirring them; when the occasion arises, they are adapted according to circumstance. Their proper sequence is the Dao of propriety. When sequence is established, it becomes the standard. Adorning one’s bearing is the means to regulate decorum.\n\nThe gentleman cherishes his emotions, values propriety, refines decorum, appreciates adornment, delights in the Dao, and takes joy in teaching—thus, he holds it with reverence.\n\nBowing—what is its purpose? Giving—what is its measure? Silk and cloth—what they signify are trust and proof; their words embody the Dao. Smiling is the shallow tide of ritual; music is its deep tide.\n\nAll sounds, when they arise from genuine emotion, move deeply; only then do they resonate within the hearts of others. Hearing laughter, one’s spirit brightens and takes joy. Hearing songs, one’s spirit is transformed and rises in vigor. Listening to the music of *qin* and *se*, one’s heart trembles and sighs. Observing the *Lai* and *Wu* dances, one’s spirit aligns and acts. Observing the *Shao* and *Xia* dances, one’s spirit strives and becomes frugal.\n\nReciting and contemplating move the heart—\nThus it is. Its duration is long,\nIts return to goodness is cautious,\nIts expression is measured,\nIts cultivation of virtue is steadfast.\n\nThe music of Zheng and Wei—\nIf one hears it and follows, it is not proper.\n\nAll ancient music stirs the heart;\nExcessive music indulges the senses—\nBoth teach those who practice them.\n\nThe *Lai* and *Wu* music is taken from deeds,\nThe *Shao* and *Xia* music from emotions.\n\nAll supreme music is sorrowful;\nWeeping is also sorrow—\nBoth reach the depths of emotion.\n\nSorrow and joy are close in nature,\nThus their hearts are not distant.\n\nThe stirring of weeping—\nGradually it fades,\nYet its lingering affection remains,\nEnding in solemnity.\n\nThe stirring of music—\nDeep and lingering,\nYet its end is sorrowful,\nLost in contemplation.\n\nAll sorrow begins with thought, then becomes grief;\nAll joy begins with thought, then becomes exultation.\n\nThe use of thought is most profound in the heart.\nSighing is its method—\nWhen the voice changes, the heart changes;\nWhen the heart changes, the voice changes too.\n\nMelancholy flows in sorrow,\nJoy flows in mirth,\nSounds flow in tones,\nEmotions flow in the heart.\n\nJoy transforms into rapture,\nRapture into vigor,\nVigor into song,\nSong into contemplation,\nContemplation into action.\nAction is the culmination of joy.\n\nAnger becomes sorrow,\nSorrow becomes grief,\nGrief becomes sighing,\nSighing becomes withdrawal,\nWithdrawal becomes clarity.\nClarity is the end of anger.\n\nFor the scholar, seeking the heart is most difficult.\nFollowing what one does brings near attainment—\nYet nothing surpasses the swiftness of music.\n\nThough one may master the art,\nIf the heart is not mastered, it is not noble.\nSeeking the heart requires effort—\nIf not found, it cannot be attained.\n\nThat people cannot feign is known—\nIf they err ten times, the heart is surely there.\nExamining what is visible,\nHow can emotion be lost?\n\nExamination is the method of propriety.\nPropriety is the method of reverence.\nReverence is the measure of things.\nSincerity is the method of benevolence.\nBenevolence is the nature’s method.\nNature is born within.\nLoyalty is the method of trust.\nTrust is the method of emotion.\nEmotion arises from nature.\n\nLove encompasses seven aspects,\nBut only natural love is close to benevolence.\nWisdom encompasses five aspects,\nBut only the Dao of propriety is close to loyalty.\nHatred encompasses three aspects,\nBut only hatred of inhumanity is close to righteousness.\n\nOf the four *Daos*, only human cultivation is truly the Dao.\n\nThose whose hearts are restless—\nThought is most intense.\nThose whose wisdom is hasty—\nTrouble is most severe.\nThose whose emotions are extreme—\nSorrow and joy are most profound.\nThose who exert their bodies excessively—\nPleasure is most intense.\nThose who exhaust their strength—\nGain is most coveted.\n\nThe eye’s love of color,\nThe ear’s delight in sound—\nThese are the intoxicating *qi* of humanity,\nFor which people will even die.\n\nIf one’s conduct is measured,\nWithout a sincere heart, it will be superficial.\nIf one’s conduct is sincere,\nWithout a steadfast resolve, it will falter.\nIf one’s speech is clever and persuasive,\nWithout a humble heart, it will be deceitful.\nIf one is pleasant and harmonious,\nWithout a resolute spirit, it will be contemptible.\nIf one’s actions are swift,\nWithout guidance, they will fail.\nIf one’s nature is profound,\nWithout support, it will be insufficient.\n\nAll human pretense is detestable.\nPretense leads to stinginess,\nStinginess leads to calculation,\nCalculation leads to isolation from others.\n\nCaution is the method of benevolence.\nYet even in error, it is not evil.\nSwiftness is the method of planning—\nIf there is error, it is blameworthy.\nIf people are not cautious, they will err—\nThis is certain.\n\nHuman emotions are naturally pleasing.\nIf one acts from genuine emotion,\nEven in excess, it is not evil;\nIf one acts without genuine emotion,\nEven in difficulty, it is not noble.\n\nIf one has genuine emotion,\nEven in inaction, people will trust them.\nBefore speech, trust is established—\nThis is the mark of beautiful emotion.\nBefore teaching, the people are constant—\nThis is the mark of innate goodness.\nBefore rewards, the people are motivated—\nThis is the mark of contained fortune.\nBefore punishment, the people are reverent—\nThis is the mark of inherent awe.\n\nIf one is humble yet the people honor them,\nThis is the mark of virtue.\nIf one is poor yet the people gather around,\nThis is the mark of the Dao.\nIf one finds joy in solitude,\nThis is the mark of inner ritual.\nIf one is hated yet cannot be blamed,\nThis is the mark of understanding righteousness.\nIf one is blamed yet cannot be hated,\nThis is the mark of deep benevolence.\nIf one’s actions do not overstep,\nThis is the mark of knowing the Dao.\nIf one hears the Dao and turns upward,\nThis is the mark of superior exchange.\nIf one hears the Dao and turns downward,\nThis is the mark of inferior exchange.\nIf one hears the Dao and turns inward,\nThis is the mark of self-cultivation.\n\nThis is the mark of humility yet being honored by the people—\nThis is the mark of virtue.\n\nThis is the mark of poverty yet the people gathering around—\nThis is the mark of the Dao.\n\nIf one associates with those of like mind,\nThey do so through the **Dao**.\n\nIf one associates with those of unlike mind,\nThey do so through the **Way of Adaptation** [or *strategic accommodation*].\n\nIf one associates with those who share their joy,\nThey do so through **virtue**.\n\nIf one associates with those who do not share their joy,\nThey do so through **cunning**.\n\nIn governing the household, one seeks ease.\nIn governing beyond the household, one seeks order.\n\nWhen delighting others, do not be stingy.\nIf you must follow with your body, do so.\nIf you speak of it, make it clear and true—\nDo not feign.\n\nIn all dealings, avoid excess.\nAlways ensure there is a proper end.\n\nWhen summoned for service, do not fear,\nAnd do not speak alone.\n\nIn solitude, practice the joys of your elders and forebears.\n\nIf there is no great harm,\nA little wrong may enter—\nBut once it is done, do not speak of it again.\n\nIn all matters of sorrow and hardship, desire to take them first.\nIn matters of joy, desire to let others take them first.\n\nThe body should be at rest yet not idle,\nThe mind should be deep yet not withdrawn,\nActions should be bold yet always reach their mark,\nAppearance should be strong yet not forced,\nThe **heart** should be gentle yet harmonious and steady,\nJoy should be wise yet without excess,\nDelight should be sincere yet purposeful,\nSorrow should be restrained yet not stifled,\nAnger should be full yet not petty,\nAdvancement should be modest yet not insincere,\nRetreat should be measured yet not cowardly,\nDesires should all be tempered—\nAnd none should be false.\n\nThe **gentleman** holds firm to their resolve,\nTheir mind must be bright and luminous.\nTheir words must be sincere and trustworthy.\nTheir guestly rituals must be composed and dignified.\nTheir sacrificial rites must be reverent and proper.\nIn mourning, their grief must be deep and lingering.\n\nThe **gentleman** takes their body as the master of their mind.\n\n---\n\n[1] The character *性* may be supplemented as *rén* (人).\n[2] Li Ling supplements as “**virtue**” (義).\n\nThis is the word *quán* (確). Li Ling supplements it as “**heart**” (心), or it may be read as “**appearance**” (容).\nSix **Virtues**... this refers to them.\nWhat are the Six **Virtues**?\n**Sageliness** (聖) and **Wisdom** (智) are one pair,\n**Benevolence** (仁) and **Virtue** (義) are another,\n**Loyalty** (忠) and **Trustworthiness** (信) are the third.\n**Sageliness** and **Wisdom** are complete.\n**Benevolence** and **Virtue** are complete,\n**Loyalty** and **Trustworthiness** are complete.\n\nTo establish **Rites and Music** (禮樂), to create **Penalties and Laws** (刑法), to teach this people thus,\nSo that they have a direction—\nNone but the **Sage** (聖) and the **Wise** (智) can accomplish this.\nTo **renew** (新) the bonds of father and son, to **harmonize** (和) the great officials,\nTo rest in the **four quarters** (四邻) and resolve conflicts—\nNone but the **Benevolent** (仁) and the **Virtuous** (義) can accomplish this.\nTo **gather** (聚) the people, to **assign** (任) the lands,\nTo **suffice** (足) this people’s needs,\nFor their **life and death** (生死) requirements—\nNone but the **Loyal** (忠) and the **Trustworthy** (信) can accomplish this.\n\nThe **gentleman** does not act in division,\nLike guiding a person along the **Dao/Way** (道).\n\nWhen the **gentleman** wishes to **seek** (求) a person,\nThey must follow the **Dao/Way** (道) [□□□□□□□□□□□□□□].\nIf one does not follow their **Dao/Way** (道),\nEven if **Yao** (尧) sought them, he would not obtain them.\n\nWhen **generating** (生) the people,\nThere must be **husband and wife** (夫婦), **father and son** (父子), **ruler and subject** (君臣)—\nThese are the Six **Positions** (位).\nThere are those who **lead** (率) the people,\nAnd those who **follow** (從) the people;\nThere are those who **command** (使) the people,\nAnd those who **serve** (事) the people;\nThere are those who **teach** (教),\nAnd those who **learn** (受).\nThese are the Six **Roles** (職).\nSince there are the Six **Positions**,\nThey are entrusted with the Six **Roles**.\nThe Six **Roles** having been divided,\nThe Six **Virtues** are thereby fulfilled.\nThe Six **Virtues**—\n[□□□□□□□□□□□□□]—\nAre rewarded and celebrated,\nFor it is known that they have a place to return to.\n\nThough **talents** (材) may be hidden in mountains and valleys,\nIf the **virtuous** (賢) [□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□]12\nAssign them as **great officials** (大官) if they are **great talents** (大材),\nAs **minor officials** (小官) if they are **minor talents** (小材),\nAnd thereby bestow **blessings** (禄) upon them,\nSo that they may suffice for **life** (生) and **death** (死).\nThis is called **ruling** (君), for **virtue** (義) makes the people numerous.\n**Virtue** (義) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **ruler** (君).\nThough not of my own **blood and breath** (血氣), yet to **nurture** (畜) them as my **children and siblings** (子弟),\nHence it is said: If one aids the **people’s** (夫) good,\nThey dare not **shrink from** exerting their **internal organs’** (藏腑) strength,\nNor **shrink from** risking their **life** (死) to do so—\nThis is called a **subject** (臣), for **loyalty** (忠) serves the people many.\n**Loyalty** (忠) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **subject** (臣).\nTo know what can be done,\nAnd to know what cannot be done;\nTo know what should be carried out,\nAnd to know what should not be carried out—\nThis is called a **husband** (夫), for **wisdom** (智) leads the people many.\n**Wisdom** (智) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **husband** (夫).\nTo be able to **align** (齐) with them,\nAnd to **never alter** (改) this throughout one’s life.\n\nHence, when a **husband** (夫) dies, there is one who **takes charge** (主),\nAnd their **virtue/power** (德) remains **unaltered** (不变) throughout their life—\nThis is called a **wife** (妇), for **trustworthiness** (信) follows the people many.\n**Trustworthiness** (信) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **wife** (妇).\nHaving **generated** (生) and **nurtured** (畜) them,\nAnd then **following** (從) to **teach and guide** (教誨) them—\nThis is called **Sageliness** (聖).\n**Sageliness** (聖) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **father** (父).\nThe **son** (子) is one who **gathers** (會) the **long talents** (長材) to serve their **superiors** (上),\nThis is called **virtue** (義), the **shared virtue** (共) of **superior and inferior** (上下),\nWith **filial piety** (孝) [□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□],\nHence the **people** (人) become **humane** (人).\n**Benevolence** (仁) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **son** (子).\n\nHence, the **husband** is a **husband** (夫夫),\nThe **wife** is a **wife** (妇妇),\nThe **father** is a **father** (父父),\nThe **son** is a **son** (子子),\nThe **ruler** is a **ruler** (君君),\nThe **subject** is a **subject** (臣臣)—\nThese Six all **carry out** (行) their **roles** (職),\nAnd **flattery and deceit** (諂諛) have no way to arise.\n\nObserving the **Odes** (詩) and the **Book of Documents** (書), one sees this **principle** (德) as well.\nObserving the **Rites** (禮) and **Music** (樂), one sees this **principle** (德) as well.\nObserving the **Book of Changes** (易) and the **Spring and Autumn Annals** (春秋), one sees this **principle** (德) as well.\nObserving this **principle** (德) is **reverent** (钦),\nTo **admire** (美) this **principle** (德) is **many** (多),\nAnd the **Dao/Way** (道) of **governing and guiding** (御止) is fulfilled.\n\n---\n**Benevolence** (仁) is the **inner** (内) principle.\n**Virtue** (義) is the **outer** (外) principle.\n**Rites and Music** (禮樂) are the **shared** (共) principles.\n**Inner** (内) principles establish **father, son, and husband** (父、子、夫),\n**Outer** (外) principles establish **ruler, subject, and wife** (君、臣、妇).\n\n**Coarse hemp** (疏斩) and **white silk** (布绖) with a staff,\nIs

      "translated_text": "「**[Explanation 25]** *\"The six members—ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet—are the servants of the heart,\"* the ears and eyes are those who delight in sounds and colors; the nose and mouth are those who delight in odors and flavors; the hands and feet are those who delight in ease and comfort. The heart, however, is the one who delights in **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). Though all these members have their delights, why are the six considered servants of the heart? Because the heart is noble. Even if all the world’s beautiful sounds and colors are present, if they are not **righteous** (义), then the ears will not listen and the eyes will not gaze upon them. Even if all the world’s beautiful odors and flavors are present, if they are not **righteous** (义), then the nose will not seek them and the mouth will not eat them. If one does not give way to elders and superiors while in their presence, if it is not **righteous** (义), then one will not do so. Why not? Because the weak cannot overcome the strong, the lowly cannot overcome the noble—how could they? Thus, it is said that they are the heart’s servants. The six members—ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet—are the **smaller aspects** (小者) of a person’s nature; the heart is the **greater aspect** (大者) of a person’s nature, hence it is called the **lord** (君). *\"The heart says ‘Yes,’ none dare not refuse ‘Yes,’\"* when the heart says *\"Yes\"* (唯), the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet all respond in harmony with sounds, forms, colors, and gestures—this is why none dare not *\"Yes\"* (唯). The same applies to *\"Affirm\"* (诺) and *\"Retreat\"* (后). *\"The heart says ‘Deep’ or ‘Shallow,’ none dare not refuse ‘Deep’ or ‘Shallow,’\"* for *\"Deep\"* (深) means extreme, and *\"Shallow\"* (浅) means not extreme. There is a **Dao/Way** (道) to their depth and shallowness. Thus, if a father calls, the mouth will reject food and the hands will cast aside their work, yet one will still *\"Yes\"* (唯) without *\"Affirming\"* (诺), and flee without haste—this is why none dare not refuse *\"Deep\"* (深). But toward one’s elder brother, it is not so extreme—this is why none dare not refuse *\"Shallow\"* (浅). *\"Harmonized, they are unified,\"* harmony means the smaller aspects are content without troubling the heart, harmonized with **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). **Virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义) are the heart’s essence. *Unified* means in accord with the heart, like a **lord** (君) governing his subjects, unified in **virtue** (仁). **Virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义) are the heart’s essence—unified, then it is **good** (善).\n\n**[Scripture 26]** To see and know is called *\"Advance\"* (进). To infer and know is called *\"Advance\"* (进). To examine and know is called *\"Advance\"* (进). To intuit and know is **heavenly** (天). *\"The Heavenly Lord esteems you, do not waver your heart,\"* this is what is meant.\n\n**[Explanation 26]** *\"To see and know is called ‘Advance’\"* (进)—if one does not see, then one cannot know, and knowing is *\"Advance\"* (进). To see is to compare. *\"Heaven watches over us below, and our fate has already been gathered\"*—this means heaven watches over us from below, gathering our fate. Following the nature of grasses and trees, there is life, yet no sense of **good** (好) or **evil** (恶). Following the nature of birds and beasts, there is a sense of **good** (好) and **evil** (恶), yet no **virtue** (礼) or **righteousness** (义). Following human nature, one clearly knows that humans delight in **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). If one does not follow the way one receives one’s fate, then following it will yield knowledge—this is to have seen it already. Thus, by seeing the nature of all things and knowing that only humans possess **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义), one *\"Advances\"* (进). *\"The King Wen was above, and shone brightly upon heaven,\"* this is what is meant. King Wen observed the nature of ears and eyes and knew they delighted in sounds and colors; he observed the nature of nose and mouth and knew they delighted in odors and flavors; he observed the nature of hands and feet and knew they delighted in ease and comfort; he observed the nature of the heart and clearly knew it delighted in **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). Thus, he held fast to it without losing it, and drew near without departing from it, so he stood out clearly before heaven, and his influence was evident throughout the world—this was no other than to see. Thus, by observing human nature and knowing that nothing is nobler than **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义), one *\"Advances\"* (进). *\"To infer and know is called ‘Advance’\"* (进)—if one does not infer, then one cannot know, and knowing is *\"Advance\"* (进). To infer is like comparing a hill to a mountain: the reason one does not name the hill as the mountain is because it does not accumulate. Shun had **virtue** (仁), and I also have **virtue** (仁), yet my **virtue** (仁) is not like Shun’s **virtue** (仁)—this is because it does not accumulate. Shun had **righteousness** (义), and I also have **righteousness** (义), yet my **righteousness** (义) is not like Shun’s **righteousness** (义)—this is because it does not accumulate. By comparing and inferring, one knows why one does not match Shun—this is *\"Advance\"* (进). *\"To understand and know is called ‘Advance’\"* (进)—if one does not understand, then one cannot know, and knowing is *\"Advance\"* (进). To understand is to draw an analogy from one’s lesser delights to one’s greater delights. *\"The graceful and elegant virtuous woman, I dream of her and seek her.\"* This refers to **delight in beauty** (色). *\"Seeking her, I do not find her; dreaming of her, I ponder her attire.\"* This speaks of one’s **urgency** (急). *\"How joyous and carefree she is, turning and tossing in her sleep.\"* This speaks of one’s **extreme urgency** (甚急). If it is so urgent, then why does one not act upon it even when it involves one’s parents? It is clear that one would not do so for fear of death. Why does one not act upon it even when it involves one’s brothers? One would not do so either. Why does one not act upon it even when it involves one’s fellow countrymen? One would not do so either. To fear one’s father and elder brother, and to fear others’ killing—this is **virtue** (礼). From **delight in beauty** (色) to understanding **virtue** (礼), one *\"Advances\"* (进). *\"To intuit and know is called ‘heavenly’\"* (天)—intuition is the **inherent virtue** (赉) of numbers. Only those who possess the **heavenly power** (天德) can intuit and know. *\"The Heavenly Lord watches over you, do not waver your heart.\"* The Heavenly Lord watches over you—this is intuition by the mouth; do not waver your heart—this is intuition by all together.\n\n**[Scripture 27]** When heaven bestows upon its person, it is **heavenly** (天). When its person bestows upon others, it is **familiar** (狎). (When its person bestows upon others, without attaining its person, it is not the **Dao/Way** (法).)\n\n**[Explanation 27]** *\"When heaven bestows upon its person, it is heavenly\"*—when heaven bestows upon its person, it is like King Wen. *\"When its person bestows upon others\"*—this is like King Wen’s bestowal upon **Fang Yao** (闳夭) and **San Yi Sheng** (散宜生). *\"When its person bestows upon others, without attaining its person, it is not the Dao/Way\"* (法).*",

Yu**\n\nThe Dao of the Tang and Yu—\nIt was passed down through abdication, not transmitted.\nThe kingship of Yao and Shun—\nThey benefited the realm yet did not hoard it.\nAbdication without transmission—\nThis was the utmost of sageliness.\nBenefiting the realm yet not hoarding—\nThis was the pinnacle of virtue.\nThus, the ancient sages and virtuous ones were such.\n\nWhen impoverished, they did not covet;\nWhen dying, they did not hoard—\nThis was the fullness of virtue.\nFirst rectify oneself,\nThen rectify the world—\nThis was the completeness of the Sage’s Way.\nThus, the Dao of the Tang and Yu was abdication.\n\nThe Sage, above, served Heaven,\nTeaching the people reverence;\nBelow, served Earth,\nTeaching the people renewal [affection];\nIn season, served the mountains and rivers,\nTeaching the people respect;\nWith renewal, served the ancestral temples,\nTeaching the people filiality;\nIn the Great Academy, the Son of Heaven honored the aged by rank,\nTeaching the people fraternal order.\nThe former sages and latter sages—\nExamining the latter to verify the former—\nThis taught the people the Way of great harmony.\n\nThe conduct of Yao and Shun:\nLoving the kin, honoring the worthy.\nLoving the kin, hence filiality;\nHonoring the worthy, hence abdication.\nThe method of filiality: loving all under Heaven’s people.\nThe transmission of abdication: no hidden virtue in the age.\nFiliality—\nThis was the crown of virtue.\nAbdication—\nThis was the utmost of righteousness.\nThe Six Emperors arose in antiquity,\nAll from this.\n\nLoving the kin while neglecting the worthy—\nVirtue yet not righteousness.\nHonoring the worthy while abandoning the kin—\nRighteousness yet not virtue.\n\nIn ancient times, Yu of Pei diligently served his blind father,\nAnd thus was crowned with filiality;\nHe faithfully served Emperor Yao,\nAnd thus was crowned as a loyal subject.\nLoving the kin and honoring the worthy—\nThis was Yu of Pei.\n\nYu tamed the floods,\nYi tamed fire,\nHou Ji cultivated the soil,\nSufficient for nourishing life.\nOnly by conforming to the natural inclinations of flesh and qi,\nNurturing the rectitude of life and fate,\nAccepting one’s lot without dying young,\nNurturing life without harm—\nThose who knew the governance of all under Heaven\nCould thus abdicate the realm.\n\nIn ancient times, when Yao and Shun met:\nHearing of Shun’s filiality, [Yao] knew he could nourish the aged of all under Heaven;\nHearing of Shun’s fraternal love, [Yao] knew he could serve the elders of all under Heaven;\nHearing of Shun’s kindness to his brother [and the missing characters]—[Yao] knew he could rule the people.\nThus, as a blind and lame son,\nHis filiality was profound;\nAs Yao’s minister,\nHis loyalty was profound;\nWhen Yao abdicated the realm and entrusted it to him,\nHe ruled all under Heaven from the south-facing throne—\nHis kingship was profound.\nThus, Yao’s abdication to Shun was such.\n\nIn ancient times, the Sage at twenty was crowned,\nAt thirty established his household,\nAt fifty governed all under Heaven,\nAt seventy retired from office—\nHis limbs weary, his hearing and sight declining—\nHe abdicated the realm and entrusted it to the worthy,\nWithdrawing to nurture his life.\nThus, it is known that he did not hoard.\n\nThe *Yu Odes* say:\n*“The great brightness does not emerge,\nAll things fall into darkness.\nWhen the Sage is not above,\nAll under Heaven must decay.”*\n\nAt the height of governance, the unworthy are nurtured.\nAt the height of chaos, the worthy are exterminated.\nThe virtuous advance through this:\nClarifying rites, revering guardianship, delighting in modesty—\nThis is the teaching of the people.\n\nGao Yao internally implemented the Five Punishments,\nExternally deployed arms—\nLight crimes, strict laws—\nYu relied on coercion, Xia on force—\nTo subdue the unyielding.\nLoving yet征 them—\nThis was the governance of Yu and Xia.\nAbdication without transmission was everlasting—\nThis began with Xia.\n\nIn ancient times, Yao was born as Son of Heaven and held the realm.\nSage by fate, virtuous by timing—\nHe never encountered the worthy.\nThough he aligned with the great age,\nDivine clarity would follow,\nHeaven and Earth would aid him.\nEven if the virtuous and sage were present,\nThe time could not be matched.\n\nIn ancient times, Shun dwelled in humble thatch yet was not sorrowful,\nRuled as Son of Heaven yet was not arrogant.\nDwelling in humble thatch yet not sorrowful—\nThis was knowing one’s fate.\nRuled as Son of Heaven yet not arrogant—\nThis was not monopolizing.\nSeeking the rise of the great person—\nThis was beauty.\n\nNow, those who wear the virtue of the Sage—\nAfter a few years, they do not wear it;\nAs rulers and people, they are not arrogant;\nConcluding kingship over all under Heaven, they have no doubt.\nWhile in low station, they do not deem the commoner as insignificant;\nWhen holding the realm, they do not deem the realm as weighty.\nHolding the realm cannot increase [their virtue],\nLosing the realm cannot diminish it.\nThe utmost of virtue—\nBenefiting the realm yet not hoarding.\nAbdication—\nThis is the highest virtue bestowing upon the worthy.",

ignorance: this is the utmost trust.\nWhen loyalty gathers, one becomes approachable;\nWhen trust gathers, one becomes reviled.\nLoyalty and trust gathered yet the people do not trust—never has existed.\n\nUtmost loyalty like earth—transforming all yet without boasting;\nUtmost trust like the seasons—all things arrive yet without constraint.\nThe loyal person knows no deception;\nThe trustworthy person knows no breach.\nThe noble one thus—\nDoes not deceive the living, does not betray the dead.\nEnduring for ages without change—this is the utmost loyalty.\nMolding yet revealing constancy—this is the utmost trust.\nUtmost loyalty knows no deception;\nUtmost trust knows no breach—\nThis is what is spoken of.\n\nGreat loyalty does not seek praise;\nGreat trust does not demand reciprocity.\nNot seeking praise yet sufficient to nourish—this is earth.\nNot demanding reciprocity yet naturally encountered—this is heaven.\nTo resemble heaven and earth—\nThis is what loyalty and trust are spoken of.\n\nEmpty promises, yet actions do not follow—\nThe noble one does not speak thus;\nCold-hearted yet feigning closeness—\nThe noble one does not act thus.\nThus, to act and compete for the people’s favor—\nThe noble one does not follow this path.\nThese three things—\nThe loyal do not create them, the trustworthy do not commit them.\n\nThe Dao of loyalty—\nAll craftsmen do not weary, yet all are nourished.\nThe Dao of trust—\nAll things flourish, yet all virtues stand.\nThe noble one applies loyalty—\nThus love and attachment gather;\nTheir words are trustworthy—\nThus they are sincere and received.\n\nLoyalty is the substance of virtue;\nTrust is the expectation of righteousness.\nThus, the ancient way of conducting [governance]—\nWas thus.\n\nChéng Zhī heard this and said:\nThe ancients governing the people—\nSought it in themselves as constant.\nIf actions are untrustworthy, commands are not obeyed;\nIf trust does not take root, words are not rejoiced in.\nIf the people do not obey the ruler’s commands,\nDo not trust their words,\nYet still contain virtue—never has existed.\n\nThus, when the noble one governs the people—\nThey embody goodness to lead them,\nWith reverence and caution to guard them,\nAnd where they stand, others follow.\nIf the ruler embodies goodness,\nThe people will surpass it.\nThe ruler in ceremonial cap and robes standing at the eastern stair—\nAll in the hall are overwhelmed with respect.\nThe ruler in mourning dress seated in position—\nAll in the hall are overwhelmed with sorrow.\nThe ruler in helmet and armor standing in the army—\nAll in the ranks are overwhelmed with courage.\nIf the ruler sets the example,\nThe people will rarely fail to follow.\n\nYet, their endurance is not profound,\nTheir weight is not great.\nThus, the noble one’s demands upon themselves are deep.\nTo seek not at the root yet attack at the branches—\nIt cannot be attained.\nThus, the noble one values speech—\nNot from those who follow superficial trends,\nBut from those who exhaust the source and return to the root.\nIf one does not follow its origin,\nDoes not return to its root,\nNothing can be attained.\nThe ruler who enjoys success yet does not honor the root—\nTheir work will not be completed.\n\nThe farmer toils for food—\nIf they do not labor diligently, the granaries will be insufficient.\nThe scholar speaks

and return to the root.\nIf one does not follow its origin,\nDoes not return to its root,\nEven if forced, it will not enter.\n\nIf the ruler does not act according to the Dao,\nThe people’s following will be difficult.\nThus, the people can be respectfully guided,\nYet cannot be coerced;\nCan be controlled,\nYet cannot be led like cattle.\nThus, the noble one does not value trivial things,\nBut values harmony with the people.\nIn order and rank, they advance—\nThus the people desire their advancement to succeed.\nIn wealth yet humility, they are lowly—\nThus the people desire their wealth to grow.\nIn nobility yet able to yield—\nThus the people desire their nobility to ascend.\nTo reverse this Dao—\nThe people will surely repay with equal measure,\nHow can one not be cautious?\n\nThus, the noble one’s repayments are few,\nTheir demands are not distant—\nPrivately reflecting upon themselves,\nOne can know others.\nThus, to desire the people’s love—\nOne must first love the people;\nTo desire the people’s respect—\nOne must first respect the people.\nThus, wisdom in seeking is not hasty—\nTheir distance from others is not great.\nCourage in acting is not resolute—\nTheir

      "translated_text": "The *Jun Si* says: **\"Only the great and single-minded extol virtue\"**—what does this mean? It speaks of haste.\n\nThe noble one says: To hasten in action yet not hasten—none can fathom its depth. To urge them to completion, to strengthen their craft; to reiterate with diligence, to refine their words—who among the people would not follow? When it manifests within and expresses outwardly, its sincerity is fixed—who among the people would not believe?\n\nThus, the constant duty of the superior is to be trusted by the multitude.\nThe *Ming* says: **\"Faithful teacher, completing virtue\"**—what does this mean? It says that trust in the multitude can complete virtue.\n\nThe nature of the Sage and that of the common person—at birth, none lack aspiration. When nurtured, they remain the same. Though they may not naturally delight in the Way of goodness, repeated practice makes it so. When their breadth and depth grow vast, the Sage cannot be surpassed or rivaled. This is why the people all have innate nature, yet the Sage cannot be emulated.\n\nThe *Jun Si* says: **\"Support these two, let no harmony be in sound\"**—words that displease the Dao. The noble one says: Only what is constant can endure; to persist is difficult.\n\n**\"A withered tree for three years—it need not be a banner\"**—this speaks of *yín* (vigilance). Thus, the noble one values *yín*.\n\nHeaven bestows great principles to order human relationships. It establishes the duty of ruler and subject, marks the bond of parent and child, and distinguishes the roles of husband and wife. Thus, the petty man disrupts Heaven’s order and defies the great Dao, while the noble one governs human relationships to align with Heaven’s virtue.\n\nThe *Da Yu* says: **\"My virtue dwells in Heaven’s heart\"**—what does this mean? It says that my virtue resides in Heaven’s heart. Thus, the noble one, even at the hearth, yields yet loves the young; in the court, yields yet occupies low rank. His dwelling is not distant.\n\nThe petty man does not repay kindness with kindness; the noble one does not repay favor with favor. In a river crossing, the first to board is not as secure as the last. In speech, the one who shouts first is not as triumphant as the one who yields. The noble one says: If one sincerely pardons mistakes, the first to err is absolved, and those who follow are trusted.\n\nOnly the noble one’s Dao can be sought near, not borrowed far. In ancient times, the noble one said, **\"The Sage’s virtue is Heaven’s\"**—what does this mean? It says: Be cautious in seeking within oneself, and thus one can attain harmony with Heaven’s order.\n\nThe *Kang Inscript* says: **\"Do not return nor clash—King Wen established punishments, crimes without pardon\"**—what does this mean? It says that those who do not defy great principles find no heavier model than King Wen’s. Thus, the noble one reverently upholds the six ranks to serve Heaven’s order.\n\nTo honor virtue and righteousness, to clarify human relationships—thus one can be a ruler. To abandon wrath and excess, to reform arrogance and victory—this is the duty of those in high station.\n\nRewards and punishments are the foundation of calamity and blessing; some precede them. Titles and rank are what confirm their legitimacy. Military expeditions are what attack; punishments are what restrain; executions are what eliminate harm. Without the proper path, they cannot be enacted.\n\nRenewal is what makes kinship dear; righteousness is what makes it honored; loyalty is what makes it trusted; learning is what makes it beneficial; teaching is what makes it orderly. Teaching is not altering the Dao; it is guiding. Learning is not changing relationships; it is self-cultivation.\n\nYu governed his people with human principles; Jie乱 his people with human principles. Jie did not first alter Yu’s people before bringing chaos; Tang did not first alter Jie’s people before bringing order. The Sage’s governance of the people is the people’s own way. Yu’s control of the waters was the water’s own way. Zao Fu’s driving of horses was the horse’s own way. Xi He’s cultivation of the land was the land’s own way. None lack their own way—human principles are the nearest.\n\nThus, the noble one prioritizes human principles. The discerning emerge to know themselves. Knowing oneself is to know others; knowing others is to know fate; knowing fate is to know the Dao; knowing the Dao is to know action.\n\nFrom ritual, one knows music; from music, one knows sorrow. There are those who know themselves yet do not know fate, none who know fate yet do not know themselves. There are those who know ritual yet do not know music, none who know music yet do not know ritual.\n\nTo take what is good—people will follow, and this is excellence. To walk this measure, only then can one surpass it. To follow constancy, one is steadfast; to examine subtleties, one avoids deviation; to take no sides, one incurs no resentment; to value thought—[illegible].\n\nThings have their proper roles; they are not within teaching’s reach. To teach governance, not the people—governance will not be enacted. Thus, even among these things, what is profound can be taught yet not doubted. What can be taught yet cannot guide the people—then the people cannot be restrained.\n\nTo honor ren, cherish loyalty, respect solemnity, and return to ritual—when practiced without contradiction, the heart is nurtured in filial piety. Loyalty and trust grow daily without self-awareness.\n\nThe people can be led by the Dao, not made to know it. The people can be guided, not forced. Jie did not assume his people would necessarily rebel, yet they did. What is received but not attained can be followed yet not surpassed.\n\nThe ruler of the people restores ritual governance; the people eliminate harm and labor—this is the path of toil. To govern a state without ritual is like [illegible] without [illegible]. Can the people delight in what is not ritual? This is the petty man.",

      "translated_text": "The Way of governance without *ren* yet the people obey—this age is chaotic indeed.\n\nTo govern the people is not merely to restore life, but to ensure their desires do not harm *yi* (rightness). To guide the people with love is kindness; to guide them without love is enmity.\n\nThe people may be shaped in five ways and made to contend in tens, but only through hundreds will they submit. The virtuous will make the people wealthy, yet wealth does not guarantee harmony. Without harmony, there is no peace; without peace, no joy.\n\nThe virtuous will make the people numerous, yet numbers do not guarantee governance. Without governance, there is no order; without order, no tranquility.\n\nThus, those who rule must first teach and guide. Teach with *li* (ritual), and the people will grow strong. Teach with music, and the people will not quarrel or vie for favor. Teach with eloquence, and the people will grow skilled yet forget their worth. Teach with arts, and the people will vie in the wilds. Teach with craft, and the people will grow stingy. Teach with words, and the people will sigh with distrust. Teach with deeds, and the people will exhaust their strength in pursuit of profit. Teach with stratagem, and the people will grow licentious and benighted, abandoning *li* and renouncing *ren*.\n\nLead the people with virtue, and they will strive for goodness.\n\n---\n*(The ruler, in governance, may debate, deliberate, act from principle, or set examples from without. He must classify these methods. All actions must align with the people’s hearts, for the people’s hearts are constant, and their enduring nature must be sought. Emphasize *yi* and gather principle—this is the essence of this chapter.)*\n\nThose who governed in antiquity led the people only through virtue. Virtue spreads swiftly, like a relay of commands at a post station. Its burden is light, yet its exchange is unnoticed—when lost, it vanishes. Virtue is nothing greater than *li* and music. Govern with harmony and sorrow, and the people cannot be deceived. To reverse this is to err.\n\nPunishments do not reach the noble; *li* does not reach the petty. Aid those who return, and the people’s talents flourish; act without timing, and there is no encouragement.\n\nWithout love, there is no closeness; without trust, there is no affection; without reliance, there is no authority; without loyalty, there is no trust; without courage, there is no return to virtue.\n\nBlame them, and the people will submit; correct them, and the people will not be stingy; respect them, and the people will not grieve.\n\nEquality is insufficient for just governance; parity is insufficient for stability; courage is insufficient to overawe the masses; breadth is insufficient to know goodness; decisiveness is insufficient to discern *ren*; killing is insufficient to conquer the people.\n\nWhen inferiors serve superiors, they follow not their commands but their actions. If the superior loves something, the inferior will love it more.\n\nThus, virtue can be easily bestowed, and actions can be redirected. There are cases where small benefits turn to great harm, and cases where small harms turn to great benefit.\n\n---\n*(Measure these actions, and only then can they be transcended.)*\n\nThus, the ruler may debate, deliberate, act from principle, or set examples from without. He must classify these methods. All actions must align with the people’s hearts, for the people’s hearts are constant, and their enduring nature must be sought. Emphasize *yi* and gather principle—this is the essence of this chapter.\n\n---\nNature arises from *ming* (fate). Though all have nature, the heart lacks resolve unless acted upon by things, pleased by things, and habituated by things. The *qi* of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—this is nature. When expressed outwardly, it is shaped by things.\n\nNature arises from *ming*; *ming* descends from Heaven. The Dao begins with emotion; emotion arises from nature. The beginning is close to emotion; the end is close to *yi*.\n\nThose who know emotion can express it; those who know *yi* can internalize it. Likes and dislikes are nature; what is liked or disliked are things. Goodness and evil are nature; what is good or evil are circumstances.\n\nNature is the master, yet things shape it. Metal and stone, when struck, produce sound; yet without striking, they remain silent. Though people have nature, the heart remains inactive unless acted upon. The heart has resolve—nothing is impossible—but nature cannot act alone, just as the mouth cannot speak alone.\n\nOxen are born to grow long; geese are born to stretch their necks—this is their nature. In humans, learning shapes them. All things differ—rigidity is their foundation, shaped by rigidity; gentleness is their constraint, shaped by gentleness.\n\nWithin the Four Seas, nature is one. Yet their uses differ, shaped by teaching.\n\nNature may be stirred, resisted, mingled, disciplined, drawn out, nurtured, or cultivated. What stirs nature are things; what resists it is pleasure; what mingles it is artifice; what disciplines it is *yi*; what draws it out is circumstance; what nurtures it is habit; what cultivates it is the Dao.\n\nWhat is seen is called things; what pleases is called delight; the power of things is called circumstance; deliberate action is called artifice. *Yi* is the gathering of all goodness. Habit is the means to cultivate nature. The Dao is the Way of all things.\n\nThe Dao has four methods, but only human cultivation is truly the Dao. The other three are merely its application.\n\nThe *Shijing* (Classic of Poetry), *Shujing* (Classic of Documents), *Liji* (Classic of Rites), and music—all originated from humanity. *Poetry* was composed for a purpose; *Documents* were spoken for a purpose; *Rites* and *Music* were enacted for a purpose.\n\nThe sages compared their kinds, deliberated their meanings, observed their sequence, and traced their origins backward. They examined their *yi*, regulated their measures, ordered their emotions, and only then applied them to teaching.",

Jie did not assume his people would necessarily rebel, yet they did. What is received but not attained can be followed yet not surpassed.\n\nThe ruler of the people restores ritual governance; the people eliminate harm and labor—this is the path of toil. To govern a state without ritual is like [illegible] without [illegible]. Can the people delight in what is not ritual? This is the petty man.",

      "translated_text": "Teaching is the means by which virtue is cultivated within.\n\nRites arise from emotions, sometimes stirring them; when the occasion arises, they are adapted according to circumstance. Their proper sequence is the Dao of propriety. When sequence is established, it becomes the standard. Adorning one’s bearing is the means to regulate decorum.\n\nThe gentleman cherishes his emotions, values propriety, refines decorum, appreciates adornment, delights in the Dao, and takes joy in teaching—thus, he holds it with reverence.\n\nBowing—what is its purpose? Giving—what is its measure? Silk and cloth—what they signify are trust and proof; their words embody the Dao. Smiling is the shallow tide of ritual; music is its deep tide.\n\nAll sounds, when they arise from genuine emotion, move deeply; only then do they resonate within the hearts of others. Hearing laughter, one’s spirit brightens and takes joy. Hearing songs, one’s spirit is transformed and rises in vigor. Listening to the music of *qin* and *se*, one’s heart trembles and sighs. Observing the *Lai* and *Wu* dances, one’s spirit aligns and acts. Observing the *Shao* and *Xia* dances, one’s spirit strives and becomes frugal.\n\nReciting and contemplating move the heart—\nThus it is. Its duration is long,\nIts return to goodness is cautious,\nIts expression is measured,\nIts cultivation of virtue is steadfast.\n\nThe music of Zheng and Wei—\nIf one hears it and follows, it is not proper.\n\nAll ancient music stirs the heart;\nExcessive music indulges the senses—\nBoth teach those who practice them.\n\nThe *Lai* and *Wu* music is taken from deeds,\nThe *Shao* and *Xia* music from emotions.\n\nAll supreme music is sorrowful;\nWeeping is also sorrow—\nBoth reach the depths of emotion.\n\nSorrow and joy are close in nature,\nThus their hearts are not distant.\n\nThe stirring of weeping—\nGradually it fades,\nYet its lingering affection remains,\nEnding in solemnity.\n\nThe stirring of music—\nDeep and lingering,\nYet its end is sorrowful,\nLost in contemplation.\n\nAll sorrow begins with thought, then becomes grief;\nAll joy begins with thought, then becomes exultation.\n\nThe use of thought is most profound in the heart.\nSighing is its method—\nWhen the voice changes, the heart changes;\nWhen the heart changes, the voice changes too.\n\nMelancholy flows in sorrow,\nJoy flows in mirth,\nSounds flow in tones,\nEmotions flow in the heart.\n\nJoy transforms into rapture,\nRapture into vigor,\nVigor into song,\nSong into contemplation,\nContemplation into action.\nAction is the culmination of joy.\n\nAnger becomes sorrow,\nSorrow becomes grief,\nGrief becomes sighing,\nSighing becomes withdrawal,\nWithdrawal becomes clarity.\nClarity is the end of anger.\n\nFor the scholar, seeking the heart is most difficult.\nFollowing what one does brings near attainment—\nYet nothing surpasses the swiftness of music.\n\nThough one may master the art,\nIf the heart is not mastered, it is not noble.\nSeeking the heart requires effort—\nIf not found, it cannot be attained.\n\nThat people cannot feign is known—\nIf they err ten times, the heart is surely there.\nExamining what is visible,\nHow can emotion be lost?\n\nExamination is the method of propriety.\nPropriety is the method of reverence.\nReverence is the measure of things.\nSincerity is the method of benevolence.\nBenevolence is the nature’s method.\nNature is born within.\nLoyalty is the method of trust.\nTrust is the method of emotion.\nEmotion arises from nature.\n\nLove encompasses seven aspects,\nBut only natural love is close to benevolence.\nWisdom encompasses five aspects,\nBut only the Dao of propriety is close to loyalty.\nHatred encompasses three aspects,\nBut only hatred of inhumanity is close to righteousness.\n\nOf the four *Daos*, only human cultivation is truly the Dao.\n\nThose whose hearts are restless—\nThought is most intense.\nThose whose wisdom is hasty—\nTrouble is most severe.\nThose whose emotions are extreme—\nSorrow and joy are most profound.\nThose who exert their bodies excessively—\nPleasure is most intense.\nThose who exhaust their strength—\nGain is most coveted.\n\nThe eye’s love of color,\nThe ear’s delight in sound—\nThese are the intoxicating *qi* of humanity,\nFor which people will even die.\n\nIf one’s conduct is measured,\nWithout a sincere heart, it will be superficial.\nIf one’s conduct is sincere,\nWithout a steadfast resolve, it will falter.\nIf one’s speech is clever and persuasive,\nWithout a humble heart, it will be deceitful.\nIf one is pleasant and harmonious,\nWithout a resolute spirit, it will be contemptible.\nIf one’s actions are swift,\nWithout guidance, they will fail.\nIf one’s nature is profound,\nWithout support, it will be insufficient.\n\nAll human pretense is detestable.\nPretense leads to stinginess,\nStinginess leads to calculation,\nCalculation leads to isolation from others.\n\nCaution is the method of benevolence.\nYet even in error, it is not

from genuine emotion,\nEven in excess, it is not evil;\nIf one acts without genuine emotion,\nEven in difficulty, it is not noble.\n\nIf one has genuine emotion,\nEven in inaction, people will trust them.\nBefore speech, trust is established—\nThis is the mark of beautiful emotion.\nBefore teaching, the people are constant—\nThis is the mark of innate goodness.\nBefore rewards, the people are
