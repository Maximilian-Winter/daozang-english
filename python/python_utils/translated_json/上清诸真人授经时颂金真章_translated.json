Contains twelve hymns of the Golden Perfections, also found in the* Hymns and Eulogies of the Perfected Ones of Supreme Purity. *Source text:* The Orthodox Daoist Canon, Proper Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\nAt the feast within the Palace of Great Radiance,\nGolden towers gleam in the Purple Clarity.\nThe fast’s gate reflects the Primal Simplicity,\nFour casements all of crimson jasper shine.\nWheels cast into the Hollow Crossing,\nReins held as green chariots dance in flight.\nJade blossoms fly like cloud-canopies,\nWestern consorts unfurl brocade banners bright.\nBeyond the dust and filth they soar,\nSwiftly entering the court of the exalted ones.\nLong-awaited resonance arrives in time,\nWhat is received lies hidden in the unseen.\nRiding the wind toward the Nine Empyreans,\nThey savor the sweetness of cinnabar’s infant bloom.\nTurning to bid farewell to the world’s children,\nHow could they know the numinous within the void?\n\nNorthward they ascend the Gate of Dark Mystery,\nHand in hand, weaving the Lofty Net.\nIncense smoke scatters across the Eight Sceneries,\nMysterious winds stir the crimson waves.\nGazing upward past the Langlang Ford,\nLooking down upon the winding valleys’ curves.\nJade flutes sing above the clouds,\nPhoenixes cry through the Nine Radiant Mists.\nRiding qi through the Great Void,\nWhy cling to the mountain’s edge?\nGolden tally summons the feathered spirits,\nMustered troops shatter the myriad demons.\nRinsing and sipping the round dawn’s glow,\nAccumulating eons like an infant’s teeth.\nAmidst the clamor of frantic striving,\nThey know not what to do.\n\nNorthern mounds brim with misty clouds,\nCrimson trees bear purple blossoms.\nAzure herbs fall in the Phoenix Grove,\nEmerald peaks adorn the crags’ embrace.\nSpirit towers soar into the Great Void,\nJasper chambers join the Supreme Radiance.\nClouds rise within the winding chamber,\nEight winds fly through the dark sands.\nNine strings pluck the Emperor’s window,\nDragons roar in harmonious measure.\nFanning the gales across the Five Peaks,\nHolding the tally to subdue the myriad demons.\nIn a moment’s glance,\nSuddenly, eons have passed.\nAlas for those born at dawn—\nHow could they know the span of ages?\n\nAt the secluded Palace of the Forest of Corners,\nThey move their spirits through the silent depths.\nSupreme vision illumines the Six Voids,\nGreat and small all attain carefree wandering.\nDragon pipes entwine the Five Clouds,\nTiger roars startle the myriad threads.\nThe Three Simplicities form the lofty chart,\nCinnabar mists glow in the morning sky.\nFeathered banners cross the Numinous Ford,\nPurple chariots soar with flowered plumes.\nReining beyond the Nine Heavens,\nThey look up and down in boundless vastness.\nDust and foam congeal in clamor and filth,\nSpirit withers, qi too fades.\nWhy not seek the distant journey?\nEight thousand years are but a single dawn.\n\nCrossing the azure sea’s waves at dawn,\nFlying wheels depart the green chambers.\nSinging high to unseen companions,\nFanning canopies over the blue-green waves.\nThree pacts with the jade-sky guests,\nFive covenants with the Eastern Florescence youths.\nFeathered gales ascend the Emperor’s dawn,\nFeasting in the Palace of Broad Cold.\nEight palaces strum the void,\nPurple phoenixes sing the numinous winds.\nCrimson mists veil the bright radiance,\nEight Sceneries soar through the Great Void.\nSavoring the jasper springs’ nectar,\nVast and luminous, they return to infancy.\nSupreme joy nourishes the Five Spirits,\nYears accumulate like towering cliffs.\nShedding the mundane—how hard could it be?\nToil and turmoil lose the Heavenly Impulse.\n\nAt dawn, chariots ride the morning’s glow,\nLoose reins set forth from Purple Clarity.\nFloating wheels race through the Great Radiance,\nRaising canopies in the Broad Cold’s court.\nHigh Perfected gather in the Emperor’s hall,\nPalace walls array the Western Numinous.\nScholars dance in the empty vastness,\nFlying mists coil around brocade banners.\nTiger banners fan the divine winds,\nAuspicious clouds wheel the dragon chariots.\nSwiftly gazing across the Eight Directions,\nA single glance topples eons.\nO fleeting mortals,\nWhy not seek the Great Life?\nThe divine gardens bloom with hidden herbs,\nKun’s pool irrigates the jasper fields.\nGazing toward the Jade Clarity’s gates,\nTowering above the Crimson Ford.\nPurple mists reflect the Emperor’s seat,\nFive clouds gleam over the Nine Mysteries.\nEight winds transcend the farthest realms,\nMysterious mists linger between green casements.\n\nThree Primes dwell in the Western Palace,\nIn Eastern Florescence, fair ones reside.\nNorthern Darkness sings the Seven Whistles,\nBright maidens chant the Southern Perfected.\nStriking the zhu instrument, they play the Crimson Pitch,\nJade tallies harmonize the Eight Strings.\nJoining in resonance beyond fate’s course,\nTogether they echo the vast phoenix’s flight.\nUnited in purpose, they command the myriad demons,\nDwelling amidst a thousand burdens.\nHow hard could it be to transcend?\nYet they open the gate to endless years.\n\nRiding qi, they gaze upon the empty vastness,\nMounting the light, they rest in the Nine Heavens.\nDragon banners glow with broad radiance,\nFeathered canopies birth the Eight Mists.\nGales flow without trace or hindrance,\nMy steeds too leave no ford behind.\nHolding the tally, they enter Eastern Florescence,\nFeasting at dusk on the Dark Loft’s peak.\nGirding sashes, they carry the Five Numinous,\nLoosening robes to meet the noble ones.\nDark resonance follows its own course,\nSilence too has its karmic threads.\nTogether they soar on mighty wings,\nA single fan stirs billions.\n\nCrimson light floats in the dark dawn,\nPurple chariots ride the clouds’ journey.\nGazing upward within the Golden Towers,\nLooking down upon the Western Florescence City.\nEastern mists unfurl the Five Glows,\nDivine essence shines with the Seven Numinous.\nVeiled reflections record the Three Candles,\nFlowing freely, they equal the dark and light.\nWinds drum the empty vastness,\nIncense smoke scatters the jasper court.\nHand in hand, they dance with the Weaving Maid,\nTwin sashes entwine with brocade’s green.\nLeft and right, feathered banners intertwine,\nFlowered canopies follow the clouds’ tilt.\nFeasting beyond the Nine Degrees,\nRight and wrong do not concern them.\nEmbracing the void within the Mud Pill,\nTheir celestial forms grow brighter each day.\nHow could they be like those in the realm of faults and filth,\nMiserable and without purpose?\n\nAt Fusang’s emerald peaks,\nCrimson clouds bloom faintly bright.\nThe Wave Terrace soars into the empty sky,\nFour vistas reflect the High Clarity.\nFlying light reins the purple wheels,\nThree Simplicities guide the cinnabar chariots.\nReclining in the Supreme Emperor’s halls,\nRoaring in the Mother’s court.\nWashing feet in the azure rapids,\nCarrying jasper flagons of divine wine.\nAt dawn’s curve, riding the wind’s fan,\nDrifting and swaying, they descend at times.\nBriefly visiting the mists’ ruins,\nThey turn their chariots toward steadfast purity.\nMysterious gatherings follow their own summons,\nWandering freely through the hidden depths.\nOnly then do they know the bitterness of honor and disgrace,\nOnly then do they awaken to the sorrow of fleeting years.\n\nIn the winding chamber, one may find purity,\nNourishing the Perfected, awaiting the sun’s sincerity.\nWhy trouble oneself with the paths of the world?\nA hundred ailments arise from this.\n\nThe Heavenly Court births golden blossoms,\nWithin, they shield against yin’s perversities.\nJade valleys echo the mysterious resonance,\nJasper qi mutually supports the net.\nHeavenly Perfected stand above the sun,\nFlying medicines spew numinous sands.\nTrue dawn feasts the Heavenly Steeds,\nTurning chariots toward the Dark Mystery’s home.\nImmortals enter the chamber,\nTheir texts extinguish the hundred demons.\n\n---\n\n**Twelve Hymns of the Golden Perfections**—all are the inner taboos of the myriad spirits, the hidden names of palaces and halls. Those who recite them will find their hundred passages opened and brightened, and all illnesses scattered and destroyed.\n\nWhen transmitting these teachings, one should always chant and intone them.
