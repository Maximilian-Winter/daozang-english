  "full_translation": "**The Radiant Divine Light of Danyang**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *The Radiant Divine Light of Danyang*\n*Composed by:* Jin Maju\n*One fascicle.*\n*Source of the base text:* *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity Tradition*, *Great Peace Section*\n\n*The Radiant Divine Light of Danyang*\n*Composed by:* Ma Jue of Kunlun\n\n**Preface to *The Radiant Divine Light of Danyang***\n\nTo seek the Dao afar while it lies near, to treat the easy as difficult—such is the common tendency of the world. Yet to perceive it with the eye and preserve it in the heart, to comprehend without words—this is the aspiration of the superior person, and indeed, Master Danyang has attained it.\n\nWith the clarity of one awakened before others, the Master illumined the ignorant and guided the dull-witted. For those who lagged behind, he further pointed the way. Truly, it was like the bright moon streaming across the heavens, revealing all things in brilliant clarity; or a lamp of the heart within the body, dispelling heat and affliction with cool relief.\n\nThe Master also composed *The Radiant Divine Light*, one hundred verses in all, that they might be sung, expounded, and mutually exhorted. Alas! The Master’s compassion for transforming others runs deep, his concern for humanity weighs heavily. Is he not like the bodhi tree of wisdom, casting its pure shade over countless sands; or the divine elixir of prajñā, rescuing the weary from the sea of suffering?\n\nI humbly offer these unpolished words to preface its beginning.\n\nRespectfully inscribed on the Double Ninth Day of the *yiwei* year of the Dading era,\nby Ning Shichang, the Rustic Recluse of Junxi.\n\n**\"Full Garden Fragrance #1: Establishing the Gate Within\"**\n\nWithin the gate, uphold the Gate of Perfect Realization,\nits pure and tranquil root-source.\nIn dwelling, walking, sitting, lying—return to the Origin.\nIn daily use, seize the moment to capture\nthe galloping mind-steed and the restless heart-monkey.\nEver act without hatred or attachment,\nbestowing kindness first, then dissolving old grievances.\nAt the outset, refine and mend with harmonious qi,\ntending the garden of leaky flaws.\n\nDeep in auspicious mist and luminous radiance,\ngather the spirit-water, letting it slowly submerge and flow.\nThough the crimson brocade snake be small,\nheed the idle gaze of the numinous turtle.\nWhen the two merge into one,\nthe primal moon of original nature appears, full and round.\nAt that moment, bow to Master Chongyang of Taiyuan.\n\n**\"Vows and Precepts Beyond the Written Pledge\"**\n\nBurn the written pledge in earnest,\nsolemnly utter the oath,\nand obey the laws of the land above all.\nSeeing men and women alike,\nregard parents with the same reverence.\nForever renounce qi, wealth, wine, and lust;\nforsake glory, abandoning the stench of fish and mutton.\nEver maintain purity,\nwith humility, harmony, reverence, and care—\nno factions, no bias.\n\nLive plainly, enduring cold and hunger,\nand when need arises, beg with outstretched hands in the streets.\nDo not covet wealth or speak deceit,\nfeigning lofty wisdom.\nAlways hold fast to caution, as at the beginning;\nwhen peril comes, steel the heart even more.\nShould you retreat from the Way,\nmay your body be sundered ten thousandfold,\neternally bound in the Yellow Springs.\n\n**Before Master Chongyang’s Ascension in Rosy Clouds**\n\nMaster Chongyang met the Perfected Lü,\nwho nurtured the spirit within his spirit.\nHis heart ceaselessly stirred with compassion,\nunfolding good causes.\nEver he projected his spirit into dreams,\ntransforming others, guiding them from the sea of delusion.\n\nAt Beihai in Dengzhou, a cloth-robed king once appeared,\nhis body soaring above the sea.\nThe towering talent of the Gao clan at Huabiao,\nin the eastern outskirts of Dongmou, sometimes revealed his true form.\nOnce he shared wine with Needle Li of Nanjing,\nand opened the jar in the Central Capital.\nEven when his phantom body still lived,\nhe manifested thus, again and again.\nHow much more now,\nhaving shed the cicada’s husk,\nhe eternally claims everlasting spring.\n\n**After Master Chongyang’s Ascension in Rosy Clouds**\n\nMaster Chongyang,\nforetelling Nanjing’s fate,\nindeed journeyed to Penglai and Yingzhou.\nHe cast off the four borrowed mortal frames,\nhis true nature ascending in transcendence.\nBy the Xunyi Bridge he appeared,\nurging Minister Zang to begin cultivation early.\nHis teachings proclaimed:\nLife and destiny are paramount,\nwhile fame and profit must cease.\n\nThere was also Great Xue of Danzhou,\nwho met him once on Zhongnan Mountain—\ntruly, distinctly.\nLiu, Jiang, and Elder Zhang obtained the elixir,\ntheir bodies hale and sound.\nWest of Kunming Pool, people saw him,\ndancing lightly in the void,\nsleeves swaying.\nHaving attained the Dao,\nhe became an immortal,\nenjoying long life and eternal vision.\n\n**In Eulogy for Master He’s Passing**\n\nMaster He,\nawakening to the good cause,\nresigned his post, returned his seal, and relinquished power.\nFar from the world, beneath Zhongnan Mountain,\nhe built a hut of thatch and rafters.\nClad in hempen robes and paper coats,\nhe delighted in tranquility,\nlaughing freely amidst forests and springs.\nCherishing the jade within,\nhe concealed his light and withdrew,\nfor over twenty years.\n\nWhy did Mountain Hermit serve him?\nMeeting Wind Immortal,\nhe spoke of living immortals.\nTruly, his passing was extraordinary,\nhis chamber filled with auspicious mist.\nAfter years, suddenly in the void,\nhe left behind painted verses of fishing.\nHe admonished me:\nLest I lose sight of the truth,\nnever boast of mysteries.\n\n**To Dharma Master Wang of Xianyang**\n\nMountain Hermit entered the Dao,\nleaving his nest far behind,\nwholeheartedly—how resolute!\nHe vowed to extinguish fire and dissipate smoke,\npreserving harmonious qi.\nWho knew that lodging briefly,\na slight discord would stir winds and waves?\nHis merit and conduct harmed,\narising from ignorance and pettiness,\nhe was mocked in verse.\n\nSuddenly recalling his past vows,\nhe compared himself to\noxen, donkeys, horses, and mules.\nWith no way to undo,\nhe emulated Lian Po.\nHumbly bearing the bramble to apologize,\nhe begged his master:\nBeat me severely!\nThrough refinement,\nlest his true nature\nmeet Yama again.\n\n**Letter to Lord Yao**\n\nMountain Hermit bows,\nsince parting from Immortal Yao,\neach day feels like a year.\nYet this clear, clearing rain\nirrigates the fields of magic mushrooms.\nI trust your divine wisdom remains aligned,\ndwelling in serenity,\nyour dharma body at ease.\nYour kindness endures,\nas ever, with remembrance,\nexchanged through letters.\n\nI humbly offer these few words,\nas Immortal Tan departs,\ninviting you on crane’s wings.\nIf you visit upon clouds of light,\nmy gratitude would be beyond words.\nA trifling matter in leisure,\nawaiting your arrival,\nI shall express all in person.\nMountain Hermit bows,\nbefore the Jade Seat of the Mysterious within the Mysterious.\n\n**Letter to Lord Dong of Horse-Running Street**\n\nMountain Hermit bows,\nLord Dong, mighty in the Dao,\nthree years since our last discourse.\nMy thirst for virtue\ncannot be fully expressed by brush or tongue.\nI trust of late your dharma demeanor\ngrows ever more harmonious,\ndwelling in ease without hindrance.\nNow you\nabide within your walled garden, nurturing simplicity,\nspare your teeth the recounting.\n\nFortunately, a favorable breeze passes,\ncarrying my wild verses and this letter,\nto convey a single message.\nTime marches on, returning like flowing water.\nSwiftly attend to life and destiny,\nwith utmost sincerity—\npray forgive my presumption.\nMountain Hermit bows,\nto Lord Dong, mighty in the Dao,\nand all fellow Dao companions.\n\n**To Liu Shouchu**\n\nThe Daoist livelihood—\nspeak little of it,\nfor nothing surpasses tranquility.\nFree from clinging attachments,\nworldly affairs cannot disturb.\nRoaming freely amidst water and clouds,\neast or west, as the sun and moon shuttle.\nDelight in travel,\nstaff in hand, sandals on feet,\nhat on head, straw cloak draped.\n\nWhether at the edge of the sea or sky’s end,\nwhirling about,\ndrunk and singing wildly.\nOutwardly carefree,\ninwardly nurturing harmonious qi.\nOnce the divine elixir is refined,\nradiant rosy clouds\nwill shine in myriad hues.\nThen,\npay homage to Wind Immortal,\nascending straight to the Great Canopy.\n\n**To Nobleman Zhu and Secretary Zhang**\n\nGentlemen, heed me:\nWithin the capital’s furnace,\nthere is also Penglai and Yingzhou.\nFive-colored rosy clouds rise and fall,\nascending and descending in flight.\nRecognizing the livelihood of water and clouds,\nno need to labor\nwith foot or force.\nSecure life and destiny,\npassing through all things—\nwhat idle strife remains?\n\nPut others before self,\nguard purity,\nnurturing the single luminous point.\nResponding to phenomena with true constancy,\nmoving or still, at peace.\nOnce merit is complete and conduct perfected,\ngo to court the origin,\nbody light as cloud-steps.\nTruly enlightened,\nlike Master Chongyang,\nneither perishing nor born.\n\n**To Lord Cuan**\n\nUnkempt hair, a face smeared with grime,\nsecret mysteries concealed in obscurity,\nnurturing spirit, cultivating qi, forgetting form.\nNot a speck of dust clings,\nmind serene, heart clear.\nCarefree and naturally joyful,\ngrasping the mystery,\nadvancing toward long life.\nIn tranquility,\nhow much better than the fiery courtyard,\nthe bitter sea of karmic debt.\n\nSleeping beneath the moon, resting on clouds,\nplaying with the Dipper,\ncommanding dragon and tiger, infant and maiden.\nDirecting the flight of gold, the flow of jade,\nin profound obscurity.\nA single point of numinous light comes and goes,\nrevealing the primal origin,\nbody light in wondrous form.\nRiding the phoenix,\npointing toward Penglai’s path,\nmarching onward.\n\n**To Magistrate Quan**\n\nWhy sever profit?\nWhy forget fame?\nOnce you beheld the true forms of the Five Peaks.\n\nThe nature of jade is like a pearl, like a seal—\nbrilliant, radiant, luminous.\nOnce this borrowed form is seen through,\nthe heart turns to ash,\nno more toiling in this life.\nSeek the path,\nlest that single point of numinous light\nfall into the pit of delusion.\nSever the threads of clinging love,\nsearch the mysteries,\ngrasp something from the void as proof.\nStill, clear, profound,\nin silent obscurity.\nWhen the work is done—seven returns, nine revolutions—\ndon the immortal’s robe,\ncrane feathers light.\nJourney toward the origin,\npointing to the jade terrace, the cloud-palace of Langyuan.\n\n**To Masters Luo, Liu, and Shi**\n\nGentlemen who study the Dao,\ndo not pursue the strange,\nbe without action, without contention, without rivalry.\nWithin the hundred non-songs, four lines,\na gatha to uphold the precepts.\nBody and mind like wood carved, clay molded,\nencountering a thousand demons, ten thousand hardships—heed them not.\nBe ever patient,\never patient, ever enduring,\npatient, enduring, enduring.\n\nPenetrate the Dao of observing heaven,\ngrasp the celestial motion,\nthe crucial pivot where harmony naturally arises.\nAbide always in the true and constant,\nalways responsive,\nalways still, always present.\nTruly constant, truly joyful, truly blissful,\nmanifesting true suchness,\ntranscending the three realms.\nTruly indestructible,\ntruly indestructible, indestructible, indestructible.\n\n**To Registrar Duan, Instructor Sun, and Daoist Friends**\n\nGentlemen who study the Dao,\nlend your ears to my words,\nas if they were a thousand household ties.\nConsider those who walk the pole, tread the rope,\nrace horses, sail boats.\nHave they ever spoken of toil or bitterness?\nFacing hardship,\nturn after turn, the heart grows firm.\nForget danger,\nforget the body, forget life,\nforget what comes after, forget what came before.\n\nPay no heed to the cold sneers of others,\ncherish the ground,\never cautious, ever single-minded.\nThough you were Su Qin or Lu Jia,\nnone could sway your shoulders.\nIf one can turn toward the Dao like this,\nsearching for the true, the wondrous, the mysterious,\nthere is nothing one will not awaken to—\nwhat worry then of not becoming an immortal?\n\n**To Wang Zhixuan**\n\nBehold Sun in shackles and chains,\nwife and concubines at war,\nthat clever, sharp-witted demon of delusion.\nThe ant-horn, fly-head names and profits,\nfavor and disgrace—so many shocks.\nPondering the shoes and slippers by the bed,\nwhen morning comes,\nwhat will the affairs of the season be?\nPreserving life and fate,\nhow can one night be secured?\nWhat is there to strive for?\n\nBetter to keep company with Shan Tong and Ma Yu,\nbeneath the pine peak,\ncarefree, drunk, dancing, singing wild.\nOn the knee, a lute plays \"Green Jade,\"\ntuning the pattern of harmony.\nIn the crucible, the great elixir is nurtured,\nthe embryonic immortal appears,\ndancing sleeves swirling.\nAt that time,\nbow to the wind immortal and ascend to Great Luo.\n\n**To Messrs. Zang, Liu, and Shi, Who Presented a Stone Ram Seeking a Poem**\n\nMoving mountains, lifting tripods,\nshooting tigers, piercing poplars—\nnone compare to the fate of the azure ram.\nAwakening to the mystery within mystery,\nvast and boundless.\nNaturally like one drunk or mad,\nfar from human sentiments,\nwind and harm run wild.\nWithin these four walls,\nconceal your light, hide your traces—\nhow could you seek fame?\n\nI only wish that all people were like me,\nholding the cloud-water way within,\nroaming freely as they please.\nMetal and wood flow with the waves,\nfire’s fate blazes.\nThen tiger and dragon wage war,\nspitting the divine pearl,\ncrystallizing the true sun.\nAt that time,\nmount the cloud chariot and return,\ntogether paying homage to Chongyang.\n\n**To Xu Daoyuan**\n\nFiercely cast off the sea of the vulgar,\nsingle-minded in turning toward the mystery,\nwith the Complete Perfection’s purity and stillness as foremost.\nIn the heart, no thoughts, no worries,\nno factions, no bias.\nFrom the void, gain some refined delight,\nguard poverty,\npassing days according to conditions.\nBy natural principle,\nfrom ancient times to now,\nfew have spoken of this.\n\nOnly the descendants of the divine Xi,\nable to bear the task,\nwithin the body naturally complete and perfect.\nThe divine turtle at the sea’s bottom,\ndivine mouth, divine breath, divine spring.\nThe numinous light once more sprays the crimson palace,\ncongealing the golden elixir,\na fresh pearl.\nWithout birth or extinction,\nwith Shan Tong, together bow to the wind immortal.\n\n**To Master Song**\n\nDo not boast of present nobility,\ndo not gallop in glory and splendor—\nthe impermanence of things is pressing, worthy of sighs.\nDo not learn the cloud-gut red tally,\nthe shackles of profit, the yoke of fame.\nBetter to follow the wind immortal in awakening to the Dao,\nabandoning family ties,\nthe immortal’s path without error.\nWith a steadfast will,\nrefine the mortal heart like jade,\ncutting away every speck of flaw.\n\nPassing days only by begging,\nsimple and artless,\ncarefree in the cloud-water life.\nAlways abiding, always pure, always still,\nalways nurturing the yellow sprout.\nFrom the void, the work is completed—nine revolutions—\nthe embryonic immortal appears,\nholding the numinous sand in the palm.\nAt that time,\nwith Shan Tong, step together into the mist and clouds.\n\n**To Little Immortal Zhang**\n\nBeneath the pine peak,\nleisurely sipping the elixir pellet,\noffering cups of fire dates and honey pears.\nStroking the heart’s zither, phoenixes and cranes,\nsoaring up and down.\nTiger and dragon roar as one,\nspeaking of the return of\nthe six thieves and three corpses.\nThe yin demons scatter,\nawakening to heaven clear, earth still,\nsun and moon shining bright.\n\nDirecting the flight of golden light and jade radiance,\ngathering auspicious mist and propitious qi,\ncongealing the true infant.\nThe body adorned with immortal robes and cloud shoes,\nrainbow hues and cloud iridescence.\nThe mouth proclaims non-birth, non-extinction,\npointing to the Penglai path,\nwhere one may return.\nThese,\nthe living practices of the Daoist,\ntold for others to know.\n\n**To Master Xu of Chang’an**\n\nFirst, clarify the mystery’s principle,\nsecond, the two luminaries conjoin in the palace,\nthird, the three powers, four images—explore their interpenetration.\nFive-colored rosy clouds come and go,\na fine rain misting.\nThe six desires, seven emotions—washed clean,\nthe eight thoroughfares flow,\nrevolving the returning wind.\nWithin the nine orifices,\ntenfold inversion—\nthe true work manifests.\n\nThe ten poles, clear and empty,\nthe ninefold gates open wide,\ngold and jade layered within.\nIn the eight-jeweled lapis cave,\ntiger sleeps, dragon rests.\nSeven-treasure flowers bloom in six directions,\nat the center of the five directions,\nthe four positions return to the origin.\nThe three lights shine,\nthe two modes follow one another,\na single divine elder.\n\n**To Senior Brother Jiang**\n\nHolding the work, sitting in meditation,\nbowing to earth, chanting verses,\neating rosy clouds, fasting, reading scriptures.\nTalisman water, focused visualization,\ngargling, swallowing—laboring the form.\nMany are deluded by the arts of the bedchamber,\ntaking the return to the origin,\nwater and fire as proof.\nYet do not blame\nthese various practices—\nthey err in cultivation.\n\nIf you awaken to the great Dao of non-action,\ncut off clinging love, thoughts of attachment,\njoy, anger, worldly emotions,\nthe mind still, the heart clear, essence secret,\nqi congealed, spirit concentrated.\nNaturally, nature halts, life abides,\narising in true compassion,\nmerit and practice both perfected.\n\n**The Golden Lad’s Edict**\n\nThen, riding clouds astride a phoenix,\nyou shall ascend to Penglai and Yingzhou.\n\n**To All Daoist Friends**\n\nClinging to beauty and wealth,\nstuck fast as lacquer and glue—\nhow can you ever be clear and unentangled?\nWorse still, the snare of fame remains unbroken,\nthe lure of profit unshaken.\nAll day long, you fret for sons and daughters,\nyet when have you ever briefly raised your brow?\nIn the fiery household,\nyou trap your body,\nroasted and scorched.\n\nIf you awaken to the urgency of impermanence,\ncasting aside love and worldly ties\nwith fierce resolve,\nthen beyond the dust, life and nature roam free—\nthis is true fellowship.\nIn daily practice, the heart is clear, the mind still,\nwatching cloud-waves and dragon-tiger roars.\nThe radiance of spirit shines,\nrevealing your original face—\neven heaven and earth cannot contain it.\n\n**To Duke Du of Xingping**\n\nStars shift, the Dipper turns,\nthe four seasons cycle—\nyet no one pauses to ponder.\nUnawares, the babe becomes an old man,\nhaving tasted wine, beauty, anger, and wealth.\nNow is the time to still the heart,\nnow is the time to let go.\nTurn your head,\nreturn to the primal matter,\nand swiftly bring it to completion.\n\nI urge you: act swiftly,\nlest Yama’s unpredictable summons\ndispatch ghosts to call you.\nJoin Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma\nas companions beyond the world.\nWith a still mind and clear heart,\nyou tread the path—\nthis is the other shore of immortality.\nThe radiance of spirit shines,\nriding the green luan bird back,\nbeyond heaven and earth’s reach.\n\n**Exhortation to Daoist Friends**\n\nCherishing wives and concubines,\nworrying for sons and daughters,\na single heart tangled in a thousand threads.\nChasing fame, competing for profit,\nwhen do you ever pause?\nLike bees gathering nectar to make honey—\nwho savors the sweetness\nwhile you alone bear the toil?\nBewildered,\nlike moths flying into flame,\nwhat a grand, foolish end.\n\n**Addressed to the Venerable Father Laozi**\n\nIn the fiery pit,\nwho pities you?\nEach one goads the worthy with greed and love,\nenjoying wealth and honor themselves.\nWhen death comes, no one will take your place.\nTurn back swiftly,\nawaken at once.\nReturn beyond the world,\nabide in non-action and purity—\nthis is the immortal’s path.\n\n**To Sun Keda of Lingkou**\n\nThis illusory body,\nwalking bones across hills—\nwhat wind and glory do you chase?\nThe place where your parents bore you\nis the very cause of your death.\nI urge you: swiftly see through it,\nclinging to children and grandchildren—\nwhat end lies ahead?\nTurn back early,\ncast off family ties,\nand cultivate truth beyond the world.\n\nA single practice of non-action and purity\nis the immortal’s secret,\nthe great Dao’s mechanism.\nRely on this in your conduct—\nwhy seek beyond the body?\nNaturally, mercury and lead congeal,\nthe ninefold cyclical elixir\ncompletes its course in days.\nThe radiance of spirit shines,\nriding the feathered chariot,\nstraight into Yingzhou.\n\n**To Masters Jiang and Wang**\n\nAll who study the Dao\nmust know the sequence:\nfirst, abandon sons and leave wives;\nnext, depart the home to beg for food,\npracticing non-action.\nWhen you see the old or the young,\nyou must first offer rites and music.\nAct with great kindness,\nevery thought and intention\nbrimming with compassion.\n\nSubdue sharpness, crush strength, endure humiliation,\ncast off clinging love and attachments—\nlet not even a trace arise.\nThen the spirit-terrace gradually brightens,\nharmonizing with the Dao.\nOn the mountain, the red dragon coils with mercury;\nin the sea, the black tiger encircles lead.\nWhen the great elixir ripens,\npoint toward Penglai and Yingzhou,\nriding a cloud home.\n\n**To Zhao Baoxuan**\n\nEmbracing mystery, far from the vulgar,\nunattached to glory and splendor,\ncontent with simple flavors.\nA heart at ease beyond the world,\nanother way of life.\nIn non-action and natural purity,\na subtle, wondrous achievement takes shape.\nWithin the cinnabar field,\nit fills to overflowing—\nwhite snow and yellow sprouts.\n\nWithin, true yang is refined,\nthe primal root and stem\ntransformed into numinous cinnabar.\nWhen you perceive the true nature through the throat,\nit is flawless as jade.\nWith effort fully perfected,\nseek Penglai and Yingzhou,\nstep by step through mist and clouds.\nIn the void,\ngolden lads and jade maidens\nwelcome you into the immortal’s home.\n\n**To Yao Xuanyu**\n\nThe Daoist’s livelihood:\na broad, raincoat-clad ease,\nfitting for walking, sitting, resting, and sleeping.\nAwakened to the joy of pure poverty,\nall doubts dissolved.\nLife roams free and unfettered,\nwandering water and clouds\nto the ends of sea and sky.\nUnbound,\nleisurely coming and going—\nwhat need for refuge?\n\nGrasping the wondrous subtleties within mystery,\ndispelling the sickness of the heart,\ncultivation resembles a skilled physician.\nWho would believe a man could conceive?\nIt is beyond thought.\nQi congeals, spirit concentrates, life abides—\ngiving birth to an immortal embryo,\ntranscending the Nine Doubts.\nAt that time,\nthe radiant return to the origin reveals your countenance.\n\n**To Master Yan**\n\nLast night in a dream,\nI fortunately met Chongyang,\nwho bestowed a secret immortal’s formula.\nIn the distant, hazy, indistinct,\nTai Bai gleamed yellow.\nThis is the color of the elixir pellet,\nflowing back and forth,\ndrunk like jade nectar.\nFormed into pills,\nswallow one—\nthe eight meridians are at peace.\n\nWielding it, the blade grows sharper,\nradiance shines,\nbrilliant and dazzling in the hall of light.\nFrightened, demons and ghosts\nflee far into hiding.\nNaturally, a divine child appears,\nriding the green luan bird\nto ascend to Peng Manor.\nThis profound mystery—\nlet all of like mind ponder it deeply.\n\n**To Master Yan of Huxian and the Daoist Assembly**\n\nThe mountain rustic Ma Yu,\nidly chanting and singing,\ndoes not boast of strength or talent.\nSeeing people dwell in the fiery household,\nenduring suffering, I cannot bear it.\nTime and again, poems and verses exhort,\nopening the cinnabar sincerity,\nrevealing the mysterious path.\nI weep and plead,\nhoping all will turn back,\neach one heeding the call.\n\nSever the ropes of passion and desire,\nreturn beyond the world—\nno entanglements, no sickness, no bonds.\nAt ease, carefree, joyful,\ncultivate and complete nature and life.\nWhen one day merit is fulfilled and practice complete,\ngolden lads\nwill hold the shao music to invite you.\nSuch is the matter—\nalas, no one is willing,\nwhat have they lost?\n\n**To Master Yu of Mount Tu**\n\nLeisurely searching,\nthe sons and daughters of others—\nwhere did they dwell before birth?\nWhat deep kinship or love\nbrings you together?\nThey cannot replace you in life or death,\nso why toil endlessly for them?\nAwaken,\nthen swiftly break from the fire,\nshake your sleeves and depart.\n\nWandering clouds and flowing waters at will,\nno entanglements—\nnaturally forgetting schemes and cares.\nThe three-fold heart-lute stirs,\nthe cinnabar child and jade maiden dance.\nTiger and dragon coil as one,\nforging the golden elixir,\never deepening awakening.\nAccumulate hidden virtue,\npractice complete—\nthe true master comes to ferry you.\n\n**To Master He of Chunhua, the Dyer**\n\nDyeing for others,\nidly pondering,\ndebating rights and wrongs to test the ear.\nGathering silks and brocades to grasp,\na full steamer’s worth.\nWhy refine until scorched,\nall for pitying their fading hues?\nWhen the bolt is dyed,\nit must still be rolled and polished,\nseeking only brightness.\n\nScattering water and paste without end,\nwhen someone comes to

true nature becomes visible.\nEver serene and still,\nthe radiant divine light shines steadily.\n\n**To Master Zhang of Xingping**\n\nTranscending to awaken to the Dao,\njoyfully leaving the mundane,\nhow could one bear to be mired in mud and drenched in water?\nResolutely turn back,\nescaping the mountain of love and prison of desire.\nWorthy to be wind’s neighbor and moon’s companion,\nchasing clouds as friends and rosy hues as kin.\nNo hindrances—\nin the human realm, first to claim\nthe blessing of half-immortality.\n\nMoreover, truly refining and cultivating,\nattaining carefree ease,\nsettling the heart and dispelling desires.\nGradually sensing the fields of immortals’ herbs,\ntheir rare fragrance rich and lush.\nWhere do tiger and dragon

like an untethered solitary boat.\nUnfettered, unbound, ungoverned,\nno joy, no sorrow.\nEver singing and dancing at will,\nheedless of others’ mocking laughter.\nWith a poor but steadfast heart,\nlive by fate’s flow,\nvowing never to covet.\n\nIn this world, like empty space,\nlike the lotus,\nuntouched by water’s trace.\nPerform the three altars’ offerings,\ncultivate the six perfections.\nNaturally, the fruit ripens without flaw,\nthe heart serene and still,\ntranscending into leisurely wandering.\nBow in reverence\nto the supreme honored sages,\nthe companions of Buddhas, Daoists, and immortals.\n\n**[To Master Zhang]**\n\nAfter Master He, the uncle, ascended in rosy clouds, there was Master Zhang of Lintong County, who ran a silk-dyeing shop. His illness lingered, incurable, until one night he dreamed of his uncle, who prescribed a remedy. Asking his name, he learned it was Master He of Zhongnan. Upon waking, he followed the prescription, and his illness healed. In the *jiawu* year, on the ninth day of the ninth month, Master Zhang personally visited his uncle’s grave to burn incense and offer thanks, erecting a stele at the pagoda. Thus, these words were composed for him.\n\nMaster He, the uncle,\nafter ascending in rosy clouds—\nmarvelous, wondrous, rare!\nThe dying man of Lintong,\nZhang, a fellow Daoist.\nThe immortal seeks no human repayment,\nhoping your noble household\nwill awaken and turn back.\nWho would have thought\nyou’d journey so far to the earth’s navel,\nburning incense in haste?\n\nI offer these verses to exhort:\nlike impermanence,\nresolutely and swiftly shake your sleeves and depart.\nBeyond the world, subdue the heart and cultivate,\ntiger and dragon in union.\nOne day, practice complete,\nthe nine-fold elixir\nnaturally perfected.\nThe divine light radiant,\nriding a phoenix to thank the master’s salvation.\n\n**To Master Huangfu**\n\nAt the very first move,\nimmortal and mortal vie,\nknowing each hexagram’s struggle.\nMundane intentions and hearts are strong,\nlike lacquer and glue.\nThe true heart, torn and made whole,\navoids the fiery pit,\nthe body roasted within.\nHold fast,\never vigilant against stumbling,\ninto the wilds beyond the body.\n\nIf you awaken to impermanence’s unpredictability,\nwield the sword of wisdom with firm resolve,\nbattling the monkey and ape.\nThen the heart is clear, the intent still,\ndragon and tiger roar.\nSpirit and qi, pure and congealed,\nthe great elixir formed—\nheaven bestows the immortal’s robe.\nRiding the clouds,\nattend the Penglai feast of peaches.\n\n**To Master Yu of Jiu Bei**\n\nCease talk of a hundred years,\nseventy is rare—\nhow much more so the unpredictable end?\nIdly pondering wife, children, and self,\nall are walking corpses.\nThe glory and splendor before your eyes\nare the delusions\nrooting life and nature.\nIf you awaken,\ncast aside worldly ties,\ncultivate beyond the mundane.\n\nCleverness turns

realm.\n\nTo the Two Maiden Sisters of Jingyang County\n\nMarvelous is the supreme principle:\nalways pure, always clear—\neasy to know, easy to understand, yet hard to practice.\nTo become an immortal,\nyou must take this as your foundation.\nCease seeking the mysterious or subtle—\nsimply still the heart,\ndismiss desire, forget emotion.\nNo defilement,\nno hatred, no love,\nno contention, no strife.\n\nOnce awakened, though touched, remain unmoved—\nin the midst of nothingness,\nheaven and earth all return to tranquility.\nSun and moon share one palace,\nday and night merge in radiance.\nNot divine, yet divinity manifests—\nriding auspicious clouds,\nhasten to Penglai’s realm.\nPay homage to the Jade Emperor,\nrevealing true merit, the Way of purity perfected.\n\nTo the Auspicious Laywoman Wang of Chang’an\n\nThe matter of life and death is pressing—\nwhy cling to children and grandchildren?\nJoyfully leap beyond the household gate.\nDwell carefree beyond the world,\nin a pavilion of idleness and ease.\n\nEver still the heart, cut off all thoughts—\nthis is called \"seizing the horse, capturing the ape.\"\nWhen worldly notions cease,\nyou awaken, clear and bright,\nnaturally grasping the profound words.\n\nThe realm of utmost subtlety and mystery\nlies where wind brushes your side, moon keeps you company,\nrain trails like threads, clouds root in earth.\nOnly in stillness do you know the cave’s depths—\nanother heaven and earth entirely.\nLife and destiny are not ruled by heaven and earth;\nwith numinous clarity,\nreturn to the origin, restore the root.\nReturn to Penglai’s isles,\nwhere there is no birth, no death, only eternal presence.\n\nTo Laywoman Wei of Lingkou, Afflicted by Wind\n\nThough born a woman,\nyour resolve rivals a man’s—\nawakened, you leap beyond the household gate.\nWhy cling to the Way’s pursuit,\nadoring beautiful women and darling sons?\nYour nature is like a lone cloud or wild crane,\nuntouched by worldly dust.\nTruly carefree,\nyou may well be called\na great man.\n\nRecognize the original purity of the true source—\nwhat need to discourse on tigers and dragons,\nthe maiden and the infant?\nNo need to arrange Li and Kan,\nthe alchemical pair.\nThrough non-action, great merit is accomplished,\ngiving birth to a formless being.\nWhen yang is perfected,\nyou become a child of the Most High.\n\nTo the Assembly of Laywomen\n\nShunning wind and fearing sun,\ncherishing your appearance,\nyou belong in painted halls.\nBefore the mirror, you adorn yourself,\narrayed in golden-threaded silks.\nBut hearing of the Wind Immortal’s molting,\nyou admire true cultivation,\nresolute and unwavering.\nForsaking splendor,\nyou become disheveled, unwashed,\nclad in plain cloth, taking refuge.\n\nThe spiritual root once fell ill—\nnow you know you must act swiftly to heal it.\nCirculate within the body\nthe sun and moon,\ndirectly reaching heaven’s edge.\nNaturally, wood and metal become treasure,\nrevealing the divine pearl,\nshimmering in clear waters.\nOnly then do you realize\nthese matters are beyond conception.\n\nA Warning Against Retreating from the Way\n\nWhy do people study the Dao yet retreat?\nIt is always because the heart lacks patience.\nThose of wealth and status may encounter\nhardship and obstruction in cultivation.\nThe poor, receiving others’ offerings,\ngrow arrogant and self-satisfied,\nsurely courting ruin.\nOr if they covet bribes,\nthey invite their own misfortune,\nuncommon calamities.\n\nSome refine the heart incompletely,\narising attachments and cravings,\ninevitably breaking precepts.\nIf you awaken to time’s swift passage,\nthe great matter of life and death,\nalways maintain caution as if at the beginning,\nabiding in non-action,\nin purity and stillness without peer.\nWhen merit and practice are complete,\nyou and the nine ancestors of the seven lineages\ntogether transcend the three realms.\n\nLament for the World\n\nWalking corpses, moving bones,\nchasing profit, contending for fame,\nwearing out the spirit, harming qi, exhausting the body.\nAll day long, they deceive heaven and obscure earth,\nheedless of the divine.\nAll because of sons and daughters,\nentangled in worldly toil,\nendlessly clinging to life.\nFor what purpose?\nWaiting until the limit of impermanence arrives,\nthey are sent into the deep pit.\nGold, jade, pearls, and treasures are abandoned—\nonly the good and evil of a lifetime remain as evidence.\nWhere is the clear reckoning?\nIt extends even to the netherworld.\nThe merciless mirror of karma reflects,\nrevealing past transgressions as no light matter.\nThey weep aloud,\nregretting they did not cultivate the Way sooner.\n\nThe Master’s Painting of a Skull as Admonition\n\nThe Wind Immortal transformed me,\nendowing boundless verses,\nyet my heart still wavered.\nSeeing the painted skull, I awakened,\nresolving to sever attachments for good.\nI wished to study the Dao next year,\nfearing this year’s impermanence might strike.\nI wished to wait for another day,\nfearing tonight’s death,\nlosing all auspicious opportunity.\n\nWhat care for unfinished ties to sons and grandsons?\nCutting family bonds,\nI roam the streets uninhibited.\nFollowing my whims, I wander rivers and waters,\nexperiencing another kind of scenery.\nPassing through endless sublime vistas,\nhow much more when reaching the golden land?\nWith single-minded devotion,\nI refine the Elixir of Yang,\nresolutely following Chongyang.\n\nReceiving the Master’s Instruction\n\nQiu, Liu, Tan, Ma—\nfour small fish,\ndrawn from the deep abyss by the Master’s hook.\nOnly upon reaching shore were we polished,\nseeking fire and smoke.\nEating firewood was as painful as flaying,\nrefining the stubborn heart\nlike oil in a searing pan.\nStartled and trembling,\nwe constantly held our breath,\nas if unable to speak.\n\nEnduring myriad trials and tribulations,\nrelying on our Master’s guidance,\neach of us steadfast in will and heart.\nWhere suffering was once joy,\nwe now vie to advance.\nOnly fearing the ape’s folly and the horse’s inferiority,\nseeing all people as parents.\nEver enduring humiliation,\nabiding in non-action and purity,\nwe diligently cultivate immortality.\n\nComposed Upon a Dream\n\nAt the time of the spring festival,\nidly sleeping in my hut,\nmy dream-soul flew to the mountain’s peak.\nSuddenly, I saw mountain spirits,\ncountless in number.\nEach wore no trace of joy—\ncasually, I asked why they appeared so grim.\nHearing my words,\nthey all wailed loudly,\nrevealing their causes:\n\n\"When we first studied the Dao,\nwe indulged in wine and craved meat’s stench.\nPunished to become local deities,\nwe lost our immortality.\nOnly now do we awaken,\nseeing wine and meat as enemies.\nWe must avoid them—\nwe urge you, Master, to advance in the Dao,\nto uphold precepts with precision.\"\n\nWatching a Game of Go\n\nContending for fame and profit\nis like playing Go—\namidst talk and laughter, strategy is concealed.\nThe mouth feigns sweetness like honey,\nyet hides arsenic within.\nSeeing an opponent’s slight advantage,\nthey press forward mercilessly.\nBoasting of skill,\naroused by greed, heedless of self,\nthey endanger themselves first.\n\nDeeply akin to Sun and Pang’s battle of wits,\nforgetting benevolence and righteousness,\nrelying solely on cunning and deceit.\nAll day, they wage war,\nnever resting.\nConstantly harboring murderous intent,\nseeking advantage in every move.\nOne wrong step,\nand it is as if the limit of impermanence arrives—\neven Bian Que could not cure it.\n\nEleven Self-Reflections\n\nIn former years, in the world,\nI constantly schemed,\ncarving life, digging death—for whom?\nDelighting in enemies,\ndrawn into endless folly.\nLike a moth flying into fire,\nbody charred and ruined,\nyet still deluded.\nI nearly lost my head\nto sons, grandsons, wives, and concubines.\n\nEncountering the Wind Immortal’s awakening,\nI turned my light inward—\nenemies and loved ones could not follow.\nAll are wolves, tigers, leopards,\nscorpions, and foxes.\nRather than nurturing these venomous creatures,\nhow much better to cultivate beyond the world.\n\nWhen merit and practice are complete,\nI shall ride the clouds to attend my original master.\n\nIn former years, fame and profit\nshattered my stubborn heart,\nwhile qi, wealth, wine, and lust sank deep.\nWithin the square inch of my breast,\nthorns grew thick as a forest.\nMeeting the Wind Immortal, I awakened—\nrealizing how profound my past sins had been.\nI corrected myself, corrected, corrected again,\ncorrected without cease.\n\nRoaming the heart of heaven and lungs of earth,\nI befriended cloud companions and rosy friends,\nmoonlit neighbors and windy kin.\nFree and carefree, joy unbounded,\nall seeking ceased.\nEven if a poor man should turn from the Dao\nto gain glory, wealth, and noble admiration,\nI would not—\nI would not, would not, would not.\n\nIn days past, Shan Tong\nbore a thousand-catty burden in the fire-house,\nendlessly contending for fame and profit,\njealous, resentful, greedy, grasping.\nTen thousand sorrows and cares\nnever once left his heart at peace.\nFor what reason?\nTo feed the mouths of enemies and kin—\ntwenty-three in all.\n\nJust as he suffered in the sea of delusion,\nthe Wind Immortal came,\ndevoted to saving the foolish and stubborn.\nAfter two years, he finally awakened,\nleaping beyond his homeland.\nNow carefree and unobstructed,\nhe refines the seven treasures of inner elixir.\nWhen merit and practice are complete,\nhe will seek Penglai and Yingzhou to see his master’s face again.\n\nIn days past, Shan Tong\nrushed about for fame and profit,\nhis body like a musk deer pierced by arrows,\nhis heart scorched by boiling water and searing fire,\nnever a moment of cool relief.\nTen thousand sorrows and cares\ntore his liver and bowels for sons and grandsons.\nUnaware of suffering,\nhe was like a fish swimming in a cauldron,\nstill darting about.\n\nMeeting the mind’s awakening,\nhe saw that all his past deeds\nwere but blades and spears.\nHis heart trembled, his gall quaked,\nand he fled far from home.\nNow he prays even in dreams—\ndares he entertain a single thought?\nWhen asked,\nhis whole body sweats,\nlost in panic and dismay.\n\nIn days past, Shan Tong\nwas too deeply mired in the dust,\nwilling to die for sons and grandsons.\nJust as he endured hardship,\nthe Wind Immortal came to save him,\npulling him from the sea of delusion\nto the immortal shore of long life.\nOnly then did he see\nhow wrong his past affairs had been—\nnurturing family, fostering enmity and bitterness.\n\nSome ask about worldly customs:\nfirst wailing in grief,\nthen indulging in song and dance.\nTheir joy in the Dao, their laughter and smiles,\nseem foolish and dull.\nOutsiders cannot understand—\nonly I know the essence within.\nDivine light shines,\nabiding in wuwei’s mystery,\nbestowed by the master.\n\nWave after wave, kalpa after kalpa,\ndiligently patching and building nests,\nfearing only that sons and grandsons would fail,\nwhat more could he desire?\nHe sought light food and ease,\nidle leisure with music and song.\nYet when urged to turn his heart to the Dao,\nhe only looked after himself.\n\nDriven to emaciation,\nhair turning white as years rolled downhill,\nstill stubborn and unenlightened,\nhis sins multiplied.\nHad the Wind Immortal not saved him,\nhe would surely have met King Yama.\nHe nearly fell into the ten-thousand-fathom abyss—\nhow perilous!\n\nLiving in the floating world,\nthis floating life,\ncraving floating profit and floating fame—\nlike floating clouds, gathering and scattering,\nwithout constancy or certainty.\nFloating splendor is neither firm nor solid,\nlike floating bubbles, lightning, fireflies, or lamps.\nFloating illusions—\nwhy do people not awaken,\nbut take them for glory?\n\nChildren are golden fetters and jade shackles,\nthe hall a prison,\nthe fire-house a delusive pit.\nWives and concubines are knives and swords,\ndrawing near, they wound the body.\nThe suffering of impermanence is the greatest suffering—\npondering it, heart trembles, gall quakes.\nFrightened,\nI turned back to cultivate the Dao.\n\nThe boundless fire-house,\nlike a prison, like a jail,\nconfined by qi, wealth, wine, and lust.\nTen thousand sufferings, a thousand hardships,\nwave upon wave.\nAwakening to turn the light inward,\nI sighed at past enmity and bitterness—\nunspeakable.\nI could only wail aloud,\nwail and wail again.\n\nToday, I see clearly:\nwife and sons are creditors of karmic debt,\nhounding me.\nWhat affection remains?\nI cannot follow them.\nFree from attachment and desire,\nmy heart is clear,\neasily harmonizing metal and wood.\n\nThe divine radiance shines—\nthis is the blessed fortune of the Great Luo immortals.\nThe master is like Zichan,\nI am like the joyous fish,\nmy descendants like the stableman.\nThose who release show mercy,\nthose who boil show none—\nhow utterly unkind!\nGratitude and enmity must be discerned,\nabandoning resentment and attachment,\nI follow the true master.\nCultivating the great Dao,\nI escape the cycle of birth and death,\nleaping beyond the sea of delusion.\n\nThen rend the mortal heart asunder,\nabide in constant purity,\nnaturally forging good causes.\nThe Kan tiger and Li dragon frolic,\na priceless treasure.\nAuspicious clouds layer upon layer enfold,\nrevealing the embryonic immortal,\na golden body sixteen feet tall.\nThe divine radiance shines,\ntoward Penglai I wander,\nreveling in eternal spring.\n\nEver straying from Ninghai,\never roaming the western lands,\never coming—what purpose?\nEver dwelling within the encircling walls,\never guarding—through heaven’s eternity, earth’s endurance.\nEver shunning qi, wealth, wine, and lust,\never in purity,\never cultivating the nine nines.\nEver single-minded,\never wholehearted,\never seeking true companions.\nEver amassing true merit and true conduct,\never and always,\never urging others to turn back.\nEver with cloud-kindred I refine,\nthe precious jade of the true crucible.\nEver approaching the jade pass and golden lock,\never sharing,\nthe nectar of immortal wine.\nEver awaiting,\nthe arrival of the Wind Immortal Master,\never to deliver me.\n\nSeventy years of life—\na rare span,\nyet I am now forty-five.\nThis single body,\nseven-tenths already buried in earth.\nOnly the fading glow of sunset remains,\nuntil meeting the Wind Immortal,\nI at last awakened.\nHow perilous!\nNearly did I lose my footing,\ndragged away by ghostly hands.\nI should have suffered in the netherworld’s courts,\nbut now,\nbeyond the mundane,\nI cultivate and become.\nAt ease, carefree,\ngrasping the subtle and wondrous joys.\nThe withered tree blooms anew,\nclaiming long life,\nfirming spirit and destiny.\nIn time, I shall depart,\nto Peng and Ying,\nadding another immortal to their ranks.\n\nSeeking friends, finding companions,\ndonning straw cloak, carrying staff,\nunfettered and free,\nall because I saw through the dusty clamor.\nAll day I sing wildly, dance madly,\nlike Wang Qiao.\nDelighting in play with children,\nsometimes keeping company with fishermen and woodcutters.\nNo entanglements,\ntrue joy, true bliss,\ntrue stillness, true emptiness.\n\nLeisurely visiting mountain-dwelling Chan elders,\nmy heart follows the cloud-crane,\ndrawn across the stream’s bridge.\nBeneath the moon, returning,\nI gather two or three close friends.\nBefore the pine grove, before the hermitage,\nwe sip wine,\nplucking the jade zither,\nburning incense in the precious tripod.\nNo worldly discourse,\nonly the wish that one day,\nwe ascend together to the cinnabar clouds.\n\nThe divine radiance of Danyang shines in full.\n\n#1 All tune titles below

Hegang**\n\nOuter deeds and outward conduct,\nthe causes of merit and fortune—\nhow can they compare to inner cultivation?\nNurture true lead and true mercury,\nflowing up and down in exchange.\nBefore the mountain, the golden dragon plays;\nin the great sea, the jade tiger roams.\nSuddenly stirred,\nformless and shadowless,\nthe infant and the maiden entwine.\nAscending the terrace of spirit, they dance—\nno need to open the mouth or sing in porcelain tones.\nDrunk on the elixir’s measure, he lies in bliss,\nwithin the jeweled tower of the treasure vault.\nThe embryo immortal takes shape, leaping forth,\ndrawing the green phoenix to steady the divine boat.\nReturning to Peng Isle,\ngolden lads invite him to Yingzhou.\n\n**Four Poems on the Hu-Han Conversion**\n\nThe Three Corpses stir and beguile,\nthe Six Bandits delude and confuse—\nnaturally they disturb the soul and spirit.\nAll day long, they vie for wealth and contend in anger,\nclinging to wine and lust.\nIntentions arise first for self-benefit,\nthe heart’s schemes unrestrained, never reined in.\nFoolish old man,\nyour body is finite—\nwhat glory do you chase?\n\nSpeak not of a lifespan of a hundred years—\nfrom ancient times to now,\nhow few reach seventy?\nCounting the days, they total\ntwenty-five thousand two hundred.\nHow much less when half the night is spent—\nand still one must guard against\nthe unforeseen misstep.\nIf you awaken,\nfollow the mountain recluse—\ndo not remain a common man.\n\nThe heart wanders, the will scatters,\nsongs bewitch, wine deludes—\ndamaging the three hun and seven po.\nHeedless of peril, ever clinging\nto wealth and lust,\nchasing flowery friends and wine companions,\nlinking steeds to boast of jade bridles.\nAt feasts and revels,\namid the throng of pipes and song,\nhe flaunts his fine airs.\nThough he possess Shi Chong’s riches,\nthough his temples stay crimson and his temples green—\nhow can he keep them?\nHe is but a walking corpse, a fool,\na witless old man.\nThough worldly glory may be sweet,\nhow can one fathom\nthe workings of impermanence?\nIf you awaken,\npursue cultivation—\nbe no ordinary guest.\n\nCast aside worldly ties at once,\ndoubt no more,\ndiscern the yin soul and the corporeal spirit.\nSpit out the corpse-worms, banish them entirely—\nqi, wealth, wine, lust.\nPut others before yourself,\nact with compassion,\nbe like Maitreya.\nCultivate the Great Dao,\nabide in non-action and non-striving,\ngradually attaining the wondrous state.\nBeyond the world, carefree and at

if deaf and blind,\nutterly free of sensory entanglements.\nBody and mind, carefree and at ease,\nunbound by family ties or love’s fetters.\nNon-action, non-striving—\nbegging for scraps to pass the days,\nshameless, without pretense.\nRoaming freely, his nature unconstrained,\nlike a lone cloud or wild crane—\nwho can restrain him?\nHe envies not glory or riches,\nnor three hundred chariots of rank.\nAll day he stills the heart and dispels desire,\nawakening to the subtle mysteries of the profound.\nWhen merit and conduct are complete,\nhe becomes a true guest of the Ten Isles and Three Mountains.\n\n**To Lord Zhao**\n\nIn a dream, I saw treasures beyond count,\nfilling my robe to overflowing.\nThen Master Yao of the Mystic Middle,\nled Lord Zhao and his sons of Zhangtai Street\ninto

verse of *Shen Guang Can*,\nrecounting the dream’s events,\nand presented it to the Daoist companions below.\n\nThe next day,\nMaster Su of the Clouds\nbrought Lord Zhao—whom I had seen in the dream—\nto me.\nThis man, newly awakened to the Dao,\ncame specially to join the Quanzhen Hall for cultivation.\nReading my verses,\nhe rejoiced beyond measure\nand begged me to complete the poem.\n\nLast night in a dream,\nI saw gold covering the earth,\npearls and agates filling my lap.\nCoral and amber filled my eyes,\njade trees and jeweled forests.\nSuddenly, an untimely bell tolled—\nstartling all,\neach heart turning to ash.\nThen Master Tianshui came forward,\nbowed deeply,\nand asked for my pure verses.\nReceiving the flowered paper and ivory brush,\nI began to chant—\nbut who, upon waking, would be my confidant?\nFortunately, the clear wind and bright moon\ndelight my heart’s zither.\nIn these few wondrous lines,\nwho shall have the fate to seek them?\nIf of like mind,\nwe shall ascend the lofty peaks of Yun’an together.\n\n**To Precept Master He**\n\nPrecept Master He,\nyou may be called my disciple,\nenlightened in Chan, awakened to the Dao, versed
