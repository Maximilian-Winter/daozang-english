  "full_translation": "**The Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing**\n\n**Title:** *Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing*\nAlso known as: *The Supreme Venerable Laozi’s Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing*\nCompiled by Song scholar Dong Sijing. Four volumes.\nBase text source: *The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, in the *Tongshen* (Cavernous Gods) section, *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) category.\nCollated edition: Qing-era *Ten-Myriad-Volume Tower Homogeneous Collection* (hereafter, *Ten-Myriad Edition*), published in Guangxu Year 3 (1877) by Lu Xinyuan.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing**\n\nThe *Records of the Historians* (Shiji) states:\n*\"Laozi, born in the village of Qu Ren in Le Xiang, Ku County, the state of Chu. Ku is pronounced ‘hu’ (怙). Originally belonging to Chen, when Chu annexed Chen, it became part of Chu—this is now Zhenyuan County in Bo Prefecture. Le is sometimes written as Li. Du Yu notes that the Le River flows to its west, hence the name of the village. His family name was Li, given name Er, with the courtesy name Boyang, posthumously honored as Dān (聃). He served as the Keeper of Archives in the Zhou dynasty, and Confucius once visited Zhou to inquire about rites from him.\"*\n\nThe *Zhouli: Zengzi’s Questions* (礼记·曾子问), annotated by Zheng Xuan, states:\n*\"Lao Dān was an ancient title for longevity. He was contemporary with Confucius.\"* The commentary elaborates: *\"Lao Cong (老聪) is Laozi.\"*\n\nThe *Shuowen Jiezi* (说文解字) states:\n*\"Peng (鹏) means ‘ear-like’ (曼).\"*\n\nThe annotation in the *Book of Later Han: Biography of Dou Zhang* (后汉书·窦章传) states:\n*\"Laozi served as both the Keeper of Archives and the G\n\nIn the reign of King Zhao, observing the wondrous *zǐqì* (紫炁) drifting westward and celestial omens manifesting, he knew that a sage would soon pass through the Hangu Pass and journey west. Thus, he sought to be appointed as the Pass Warden, and the king complied.\n\nUpon arriving at the Pass, he declared:\n*\"The Yang numbers reach their peak at nine, the stars align with Metal, the year and month coincide with the king’s reign—by law, a great sage shall pass through the capital within ninety days.\"*\n\nHe first instructed the Pass officer, Sun Jing, saying:\n*\"If there be a stranger of unusual appearance, with distinctive carriage and attire, do not allow passage.\"*\n\nEmblem Xī (喜) prepared himself with fasting and purification, sweeping the road and burning incense in anticipation.\n\nAt that time, in the twenty-third year of King Zhao’s reign, on the fifth month’s *rénwǔ* (壬午) day, the Old Master, riding a green ox-drawn chariot with a thatched canopy and Xu Jia as his charioteer, set out to civilize the Western Regions.\n\nOn the twelfth day of the seventh month, *jiǎzǐ* (甲子), a venerable old man appeared—his hair snowy white, his ears long—riding a white carriage drawn by a green ox.\n\nThe officers said:\n*\"The magistrate has ordered: Kind sir, please tarry a moment.\"*\n\nThey then reported to Xī, who immediately donned his official robes and went out to greet him, bowing his head in reverence.\n\nThe Old Master declined three times, but Xī said:\n*\"Last winter, the tenth month, the Celestial Pattern Star passed west over the Pleiades. This month’s new moon saw the *róngfēng* (融风) three times, and the true *qi* of the East, like a dragon-serpent, moved westward—this is the sign of a great sage.\"*\n\nThus, he arranged for the Old Master to stay in the official guesthouse and seated him in accordance with the rites for a master-disciple relationship.\n\nXī then feigned illness and resigned his post. On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he escorted the Old Master back to his home. On the twenty-eighth day, the Old Master imparted the *Wǔqiānzi* (五千言). The following year, on the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month, he bade farewell on the southern mountain’s mound and ascended to heaven, instructing that he would be sought again after a thousand days at the Green Sheep Market.\n\nIn the twenty-seventh year, they met at the home of Li Taiguan in Shu. At that time, the celestial hosts and immortals descended from the sky, and the Old Master commanded the Five Elders and the Supreme Deities to grant Xī a jade tablet with golden inscriptions, bestowing upon him the title *Wénshǐ Xiānsheng* (文始先生) and the rank of *Wúshàng Zhēnrén* (无上真人). He was also granted a purple robe and a peony-crowned cap, and allowed to wander beyond the Eight Strings (of the celestial sphere).\n\nHe was called *Lǎozi* (老子) because he was born with white hair, and also because he cultivated the Dao and nourished his longevity.\n\nThe *Dàodéjīng* (道德经) expounds upon the principles of virtue and the Way, and may be followed perpetually.\n\nThe *Tang Yìwén Zhì* (唐艺文志) states:\n*\"During the Tianbao era, it was further titled the *Lǎozi Xuāntōng Dàodéjīng* (老子玄通道德经).\"*\n\nGe Xuan’s preface reads:\n*\"The Five Thousand Words proclaim the source of virtue and the Way, encompassing all that is great without exclusion, all that is minute without omission—it is the natural scripture of heaven and humanity.\"*\n\nBān Gù recorded the traditions of Laozi, with Fu Shi’s thirty-seven chapters, Lin Shi’s four, Xu Shi’s six, and Liu Xiang’s four. Du Guangting noted the commentators:\n*\"There are Emblem Xī’s Inner Exegesis, Han Zhang Daoling’s Xiang’ěr, He Shang Gong’s Chapter-by-Chapter Analysis, Yan Zun’s Indicators, Wei Wang Bi, He Yan, Guo Xiang, Zhong Hui, Sun Deng, Jin Yang Fu, Pei Chu Si, Fu Jian’s monk Luo Shi, Hou Zhao’s Fo Tuo Cheng, Jin Seng Zhao, Liang Tao Hong Jing, Hou Wei Lu Jingyu, Liu Renhui, Nan Qi Gu Huan, Song Ling Xianren, Qi Du Pi, Song Zhang Ping, Liang Wu Di, Liang Jian Wen Di, Zhang Si, Liang Dao Shi Zang Xuan Jing, Meng Anpai, Meng Zhizhou, Dou Lue, Chen Dao Shi Chu Rou, Sui Dao Shi Li Bo, Liu Jinxi, Tang Wei Zheng, Fu Yi, Yang Shangshan, Jie Zhi, Wang Guangting, Wang Zhen, the Immortal Hu Chao, the Daoist Song Wenming, Yin Wencao, Wei Lu, Wang Xuanbian, Yin Yan, Xu Mian, He Siyuan, Xue Jichang, Wang Di, Zhao Zhijian, Che Huibin, Li Rong, Li Yuanxing, Zhang Huichao, Gong Fashi, Ren Taixuan, Shen Fu, Zhang Daoxiang, Cheng Xuan Ying, Fu Shaoming.\"*\n\nThe *Tang Yìwén Zhì* further lists:\n*\"An Qiu Wangzhi, Xiang Yi (whose surname is lost), Cheng Shao, Wang Shang, Shu Cai, Yuan Zhen, Shi Huìyán, Huìlín, Yìyíng, Liang Kuangshu, Li Yunyuan, Chen Sigu, Feng Kuò, Xuánjǐng Xiānsheng, Yang Shangqi, Han Du, Jia Dayin, Bìlǘ Rénxù, Liu Zhongrong, Wang Su, Dai Yan, Yuán Zōng, Lú Cángyòng, Xíng Nánhé, Féng Cháo yǐn, Bái Fùzhōng, Yín Zhīzhāng, Lǚ Dé Míng, Chén Tíngyù, Lǚ Xīshēng, Wú Shànjīng, Sūn Sīmiào, Lǐ Hán Guāng—forty families in total.\"*\n\nYet in the *Zàng* (藏), those preserved include Li Yue, Jia Qingyi, Wang Gu, and Du Guangting—all Tang-era figures—some not even recorded in the *Zhì*. Thus, it is known that the records are still incomplete.\n\nAlas, of those whose names survive but whose works are lost, nine out of ten are gone.\n\nHe Shang Gong divided it into eighty-one chapters, corresponding to the extreme number of the Taiyang (Great Yang).\n\nThe *Upper Scripture* has thirty-seven chapters, following the odd numbers of heaven; the *Lower Scripture* has forty-four, following the paired numbers of earth.\n\nLiu Yin’s *Qīlüè* (七略) states:\n*\"Liu Xiang established it as two sections of eighty-one chapters: thirty-four in the Upper, forty-seven in the Lower.\"*\n\nYet Ge Hong and others later added or subtracted, claiming:\n*\"Heaven completes with four seasons, hence the Upper Scripture has four nines—thirty-six chapters. Earth completes with five phases, hence the Lower Scripture has five nines—forty-five chapters, totaling the nine-nine number.\"*\n\nQīngyuánzi Liu Jì said:\n*\"If spoken hastily, it was never divided into nine sections.\"*\n\nYan Zun, considering the nine Yang and eight Yin multiplied together, made seventy-two chapters—forty in the Upper, thirty-two in the Lower.\n\nWang Bi combined the Upper and Lower into a single text, without division into chapters.\n\nToday’s editions mostly follow He Shang Gong’s chapter divisions, or group them into Upper and Lower Scriptures.\n\nDòng Áo of Guangchuan noted:\n*\"After Emperor Xuānzōng of Tang annotated the *Lǎozi*, the chapter divisions were first standardized.\"*\n\nThe text that speaks of the **Dao/Way** is classified in the **Upper Scripture**, while the text that speaks of **virtue/power** is classified in the **Lower Scripture**; these were engraved in stone at the **Yuékǒu Temple** in **Lǎozi’s** lineage.\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng’s annotation explained:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** is the essence of **virtue/power**; **virtue/power** is the application of the **Dao/Way**. The Scripture is divided into Upper and Lower to first elucidate the **Dao/Way**, followed by **virtue/power**. Yet at its conclusion, it states:*\n*'Thus one knows that essence and application are mutually expressed, each clarifying the core principle, and there is no need to rigidly name them as Upper or Lower.'*\n\nDòng Áo of **Jiāngmào** remarked:\n*\"In my past visits to libraries, I have seen ancient texts where the sequence of the *Lǎozi* differs greatly from today’s chapter divisions, and I have also doubted whether later scholars may have altered its original structure.\"*\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng commanded **Sīmǎ Zǐwēi** to transcribe the text in three styles (**sān tǐ**—likely referring to *old text*, *transmitted text*, and *commentary*), resulting in a version of **5,380 characters**.\n\nFù Yì examined numerous manuscripts and verified their character counts, stating:\n*\"The **Xiàngyǔ’s Concubine’s** manuscript was unearthed from her tomb in **Péngchéng** by a local scholar in the **5th year of Qí Wǔpíng’s** reign (269 CE).\nThe **Ānqiú Wàngzhī’s** manuscript was obtained by the **Daoist** **Kòu Qiānzhī** during the **Wèi Tàihé** era (227–233 CE).\nThe **Héshàng Zhàngrén’s** manuscript was passed down by the **recluse** **Qiú Yuè** of **Qí**.\"*\n\nThe three manuscripts total **5,722 characters**, which aligns closely with *Han Fei’s* *Yù Lǎozǐ* [《喻老》]. The **Lòuyáng official edition** contains **5,635 characters**, while **Wáng Bì’s** version has **5,683 characters**, with variations of **610, 355, or 590 characters**—the counts differ.\n\nThe *Records of the Grand Historian* states it contains over **5,000 words**, though not reaching **6,000**, which is accurate. The current claim of **5,000 characters** refers to the full count.\n\n**Péng Zhì’s** *Huáng Sòng* compilation includes commentaries by:\n- Emperor Xuānzōng’s *Zhènghé* imperial annotations,\n- Daoist **Chén Jǐngyuán**,\n- **Sīmǎ Wēngōng Guāng**,\n- **Sū Wéndìng**,\n- **Wáng Jīnggōng Ānshí**,\n- **Wáng Pán**,\n- **Lù Tiǎn**,\n- **Liú Gài**,\n- **Liú Jǐng**,\n- **Xiān Gū Cáodàochōng**,\n- **Mǎ Tíshān**,\n- **Dázhēn Zǐ**,\n- **Yīliǎo Zǐ**,\n- **Lǐ Wénchóu**,\n- **Chén Xiànggǔ**,\n- **Yè Mèngdé**,\n- **Qīngyuán Zǐ Liú Jì**,\n- **Zhū Wén Gōng Xī**,\n- **Huáng Màocái**,\n- **Chéng Wénjiǎn Gōng Dàchāng**,\n- **Lín Dōng**,\n- **Shào Ruòyú**,\n- **Ní Wénjié**,\n- **Gāo Shì Xú Zhīcháng**,\nand others—though not all are listed exhaustively.\n\nIn essence, the **Dao of Lǎozǐ** takes **cleansing, non-action, and natural spontaneity** as its core, **emptiness and clarity in responding to things without obstruction** as its application, **compassion, frugality, humility, and non-contentiousness** as its conduct, and **desirelessness, non-interference, and non-precedence over Heaven to benefit humanity** as its governance. In governing self and others, it attains the utmost.\n\nIf applied, the governance of **Tàigǔ** could be restored.\n\nThe *Records of the Han*’s *Arts and Literature Register* states:\n*\"The Daoist school holds fast to the essentials and roots, guards itself in purity and emptiness, and maintains itself in humility and weakness—this is the art of ruling as a sovereign.\"*\n\n**Ouyáng Xiū** in *Chóngwén Zǒngshū* writes:\n*\"Rooted in purity and emptiness, abandoning ambition and greed, serene and self-guarded, hence the saying: ‘I do nothing, yet the people transform; I love stillness, yet the people align.’ Even the Sage’s governance cannot surpass this.\"*\n\nGiven the times, when literary flourish prevailed and the pure, unadorned customs had vanished, **Lǎozǐ** upheld his **unadulterated Dao**, aligning with the age’s extremes. Though he responded only when moved, he could not attain office to propagate his Dao across the world. Yet he knew the **fate of the times**, yet still his teachings did not vanish—thus, he taught without distinction, and though his influence extended to the **Western lands of strange customs**, how profound was his pity for his own time and concern for posterity!\n\nFortunately, this text endured, so **Xīguān** awaited his arrival, **Dōnglǔ** beheld his dragon, and the **Book and its words** still remain.\n\nFigures like **Héshàng Zhàngrén**, **Huángshí Gōng**, **Lèchén Gōng**, and **Gài Gōng**’s disciples understood its essence and embodied it, refining its applications within themselves—thus, their world already resembled **Xīnhuáng’s** era.\n\nWhen his Dao was passed on, **Emperor Xiào** ruled by it, **Zǐfáng** assisted the **Hàn**, and **Cáo Shēn** governed **Qí**, truly reviving the **unbroken lineage** after the **tyranny of Qín**.\n\nAh! This is verified.\n\nYet if one were to surpass this—if one followed **Xīnhuáng’s** model, one would indeed achieve **Xīnhuáng’s** governance.\n\nSome see this book’s **grand and expansive words** but fail to grasp its **subtle essence of emptiness, stillness, and profound sincerity**, mistaking its **foundation for all affairs** as mere **obscure, sluggish dullness**, thus falling into **indulgent neglect**, leading to the criticism that **emptiness fails in application**. Hence, they dismiss it without examination.\n\nAlas, what a pity!\n\n**Wén Zhōngzǐ** said: *\"Prolonged emptiness led to the chaos of the Jìn—this was not Lǎozǐ’s fault.\"*\n\n**Zhū Wén Gōng** declared: *\"The Jìn officials merely used his words to justify their abandonment of ritual and law. Given their corrupt and turbulent hearts, how could they comprehend Lǎozǐ’s true intent?\"*\n\nIn the *Old Book of Tang*, **Lǐ Fān** replied: *\"Lǎozǐ’s* **Zhǐguī** *differs not from the Six Classics.\"*\n\n**Li Yào**, a **Bīngbù Láng** of the Tang, stated: *\"The world claims this book speaks of divine immortality and emptiness, yet the Six Classics are merely its branches—**Huáng-Lǎo’s** offshoots.\"*\n\nThus, **Sīmǎ Qiān** in discussing the **Great Dao** prioritized **Huáng-Lǎo** over the Six Classics—not without reason.\n\nThough the **grand principles** of this text are evident in various commentaries, some criticize its lack of **moderation**. I, a **dim-witted late learner**, presumptuously adopt and synthesize these views, adding my own insights to supplement a few gaps. Sometimes I **explicate the text**, sometimes **elaborate its intent**, appending **phonetic annotations** and **cross-referencing discrepancies**, aiming to aid comprehension. May this lead to **daily improvement**, aligning with the **Dao beyond words** in the realm of **absolute learning and carefree wisdom**.\n\nSome say **subtle teachings and hidden precepts** abound, thus the **first chapter’s \"having\" and \"not having\"** refer to the **Two Elixirs**—**spiritual qi and water-fire**. **Emptying the heart and filling the belly** signifies **refining lead**; **skilled warfare** denotes **extracting lead**.\n\nThe character **chōng** (冲), composed of **water and center**, symbolizes **true-one qi within the breath**. **Thirty spokes converge at one hub**, illustrating the **five viscera each harboring six qi**, as well as the **monthly fire符’s alignment**.\n\nSuch meanings are now omitted.\n\nSome interpret **\"not having\"** as **Earth’s Two Fire**, and **\"having\"** as **Heaven’s One Water**, thus citing the *Gǎngtōng Jué*:\n*\"Two voids submit to one existence—mysterious transformation, beyond comprehension.\"*\n\nAnd they derive the **gold-water theory** of **\"preserving white while embracing black\"**, though this pertains to **Great Elixir methods**, aligning with the **Yì’s symbols**, modeling **Heaven and Earth**, using **sun-soul and moon-shadow as medicines**—as seen in:\n- **Shénnóng’s** ancient *Lónghǔ Shàngjīng* (36 characters),\n- **Huáiyáng Wáng’s** *Jīnbì Yàozhǐ Jīng* (Western Han),\n- **Wèi Bóyáng’s** *Cāntóng Qì* (Eastern Han),\n- **Yuányáng Zǐ’s** *Jīnbì Qiántōng Jué* (Tang).\n\nThus, the methods are established.\n\n「As the *Hùnyuán Shílù* states: The **Dao Master** first taught **Yín Zhēn** the **Inner and Outer Two Elixirs** as safeguards, then revealed the **principles of Dao and virtue**. Thus, it is clear that **Elixir Craft** was not intermingled with the **fundamentals of this Scripture**.\n\nMoreover, the **Three-One-Nine Thoughts** (三一九思) are the essence of **inner cultivation**. The **Nine Elixirs of Golden Liquid** (九丹金液) represent the pinnacle of **external refinement**. Hence, the **Too-Qīng Scriptures** he was taught focus solely on the **external refinement of Golden Liquid**, though they differ little from the **Great Elixir methods** mentioned earlier.\n\nLater disciples, seeing the **altars, furnaces, and crucibles** (坛炉鼎灶) set up, mistakenly regarded **sacred minerals and metals** (灵砂金石) as **external elixirs**. Little did they know that **post-heaven substances** (后天) are impure and **yin-heavy** (阴杂非类), consuming them causes agitation, loss of clarity, and failure to grasp their true nature.\n\nOthers further say: **\"Not having\"** refers to **Spirit** (神), **\"having\"** to **Qi** (氣). Thus, the **interplay of presence and absence** (有无交入) is the **foundation of Elixir**, while **\"hidden and revealed\"** (隐显相符) correspond to the **interaction of Water and Gold**. **\"White within black\"** (黑中有白) signifies the **Elixir Matrix**, and the **poetic lines on the unity of the thirty-two spokes with the hub** (三十辐兮同一毂) serve as proof. Though these interpretations all borrow phrases from the Scripture to construct their own **precepts**, they form a distinct **school**, namely the **method of Inner Elixir**.\n\nAs for **Yín Zhēn’s** received **Three-One-Nine Thoughts** (三一九思), though termed **inner cultivation**, they differ fundamentally from the **Inner Elixir lineage**. In essence, **Dao, methods, and Scriptures** each have their own **purpose and scope**; one cannot exhaust all schools with a single text. If forced to merge them, such interpretations are merely **fabricated analogies**.\n\nWhy? **Nature must be self-awakened** (性由自悟), while **methods rely on transmission from a teacher** (术假师传). If these truths are indeed **concealed within profound meaning**, the adept must receive **oral instruction in meticulous detail** before doubts are dispelled. How can mere **written words** suffice?\n\nMoreover, the Scripture **proclaims the Dao of virtue and non-action**, transcending all forms, and **penetrating the subtlest cycles**. How could it accommodate such **external speculations and minor arts**?\n\n**Bái Lètiān** remarked: *\"The Five-Thousand-Word Scripture of the Primordial Emperor speaks not of medicines, not of immortals, nor of ascending to the Green Sky in White Day.\"* This is a sound observation.\n\n**Sū Wénzhōnggōng** (蘇文忠公) **Zhuó** composed the **inscription for the Chǔxiáng Palace** upon imperial command. Its general meaning is as follows:\n\nThe **Daoist tradition** originates with **Huángdì** and **Lǎozǐ**. Its **Dao** is **purity, tranquility, and non-action**; its **application** is **clarity and responsiveness**; its **conduct** is **modesty, benevolence, and non-contentiousness**. This aligns with the *Yì*’s **\"What thoughts? What contemplations?\"** and the *Lúnyǔ*’s **\"The virtuous person is tranquil and attains longevity.\"**\n\nSince the **Han Dynasty**, Daoists began incorporating **alchemists’ teachings**, introducing **arts of transcendence and transformation**, such as the **Yellow Court and Great Cavern methods**, the **titles of Wood Official and Golden Mother**, and the **veneration of Tàiyǐ and Zǐwēi**. Even **external elixir techniques, talismans, and minor arts** were all subsumed under **Daoist practice**.\n\nI have pondered this: The **Dao of Huángdì and Lǎozǐ** is the **foundation**; the **alchemists’ words** are the **branches**. Grasping the foundation naturally leads to the branches. Alas, cultivating it **for oneself**, one’s **virtue is genuine**; applying it **to the world**, one’s **virtue becomes universal**—not two distinct foundations.\n\nIf scholars truly **master the One** and **unify its principles**, then the so-called **\"profound and elusive essences\"** and **\"flickering, wondrous subtleties\"** will **manifest within the practice of guarding the Center and embracing the One** (守中抱一), while the **\"mysterious feminine\"** and **\"the use of the gourd’s latch\"** (橐钥之用) are all **works of the Dao**. Only those **deeply cultivated and self-actualized** understand this.\n\nWritten in the **twelfth month of the 11th year of Chúnyòu** (淳佑丙午腊月), by the **humble student Dòng Sījìng** of **Qīngyuán Tiānqìng Guān** (清源天庆观), at **Jūishān** (圭山).\n\n---\n**Volume One of *Dàodé Zhēnjīng Jíjiě* (道德真经集解) – Exegesis by the Humble Student Dòng Sījìng**\n\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\"*\n\nThis **precedes the entire discourse**, marking its **beginning**.\n\n**Dao** is the **comprehensive term for all principles** (万理之总名).\n**Name** is the **designation of all things** (万物之所指).\n\nYet **Dao cannot be named**—not because words are inadequate, but because **Dao must be conveyed through words**, and though **forced to name it as Dao**, it is **not the eternal Dao or name**. Thus, the **Dao that can be named** and the **name that can be named** are **not the eternal Dao and name**.\n\nThe **eternal Dao and name** are as the Scripture states: **Dao is eternal and nameless**, yet **its name persists from antiquity to the present**. **Eternal** means **naturally enduring**, without **time or place** where it does not exist.\n\n**Nameless**, the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**—this speaks of **Dao as the origin of all things under Heaven**.\n\nSince **Dao lacks any trace or sign**, none can name it. This is the **eternal Dao and name**, the **form beyond form** (形而上).\n\n**Having a name**, the **mother of all things**—this refers to **the Two Principles established**, where **all things can be named**, and **all existence arises from here**, the **form within form** (形而下).\n\n*\"Eternal non-desire, to observe its mystery\"*—this means the **Sage embodies Dao within oneself**, remaining **serene and unmoving**, while **the Spirit’s presence** is **what is stored**. Here, **Dao’s subtlest essence** is **visible**.\n\n**Eternal** is the **true, constant, and wondrous origin** (真常妙本).\nNon-desire is **stillness**—this is **Dao’s constant nature**.\nDesire is **movement**—this is **Dao’s active function**.\n\nThough **stillness and movement** are not simultaneous, **essence and function** must be **distinct**. Yet the **wondrous origin** is **profoundly settled**, **still yet ever-responsive**, **responsive yet ever-still**, never ceasing—**eternally as it is**.\n\nThus, it is called *\"eternal observation\"*—**impartial and vast**, **illuminating all stillness**.\n\n*\"Eternal desire, to observe its boundary\"*—this is the **time of response and adaptation**, where **Dao’s wondrous function** can be **observed**.\n\nThis refers to **movement’s visible aspects**, as **Zhōu Zǐ** said: *\"Stillness is nameless; movement is named.\"*\n\n**Chén Jǐngyuán** remarked: *\"The great Dao has a lesser path called the boundary.\"* These two—**nameless and named**, **mystery and boundary**—**share the same source yet differ in name**, both called **the Profound** (玄).\n\n*\"The Profound yet again profound—\nThe gateway to all wonders.\"*\n\nThis **concludes the preceding meaning**.\n\nThe two refer to **nameless and named**, **mystery and boundary**. Since **essence and function** stem from **one source**, they are **the same**.\n\n**\"Out\" (出) is the meaning of movement and stillness.**\n\nIt refers to either movement or stillness, yet **essence and function** are divided within them, hence it is called **\"different names\"**.\n\nThough the names differ, their **source is one**, so it is also called **\"the same\"**.\nOnly when they are **the same**, their **nature and disposition** are profound and unquestionable—this is called **the Profound (玄)**.\n\nAll things that are **far-reaching and without limit** must have **their hue as the Profound (玄)**, and in the human heart, this is the meaning of **abyssal silence and formlessness**.\n\nThough **the Profound (玄)** is **endlessly transformative and unfathomably deep**, yet **the heart of the Profound** still exists within it.\n\nAgain, **the Profound (玄)**, it **discards the burdens of stagnant profundity**, **serene yet leaving no trace**, yet able to **open and close yin and yang**, **generate transformations without cessation**—this is because **it lies at the most subtle juncture of affairs and principles**, and **all wonders arise from it**, hence it is called **the gateway to all wonders**.\n\nThis entire chapter is named **\"The Chapter of Essence and Dao\"** by Master Héshànggōng (河上公), while other scholars often take the first few characters of the chapter as its title.\nThis chapter **embodies the core intent** of the *Guīxù* (揆序) Canon.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"What of 'named' and 'nameless'?\"* Earlier masters often took **\"without\" (无) and \"with\" (有)** as the key phrases, but now it is not so—why?\n\nI say: **\"The nameless\" is the Dao**, **\"the named\" is qi (炁)**.\nOnly the Dao is **formless**, while qi has **manifestations**—thus they are distinguished by **\"nameless\" and \"named\"**.\n\nWhen it is said **\"the nameless at the beginning of heaven and earth\"**, it means the Dao **existed before heaven and earth**, yet **initially there was no fixed name to point to**, hence the Canon says *\"The Dao is ever nameless\"* and *\"The Dao is hidden and nameless\"*.\n\nThough the Dao is **omnipresent**, transcending **the state before any thingness (无物)**, it is also **never absent from the state after any thingness (有物)**.\nThus, in **non-being (无)**, it is **non-being**; yet it **never stagnates in non-being**.\nIn **being (有)**, it is **being**; yet it **never confines itself to being**.\nOnly because it **cannot be fixedly named**, yet its name has **always existed from antiquity**, this is why it is called **\"the eternal Dao and the eternal named\"**.\n\nIf one were to **directly name it \"without\" (无)**, then it would be **restricting the Dao solely to non-being**, and when **non-being transforms into being**, one could no longer call it **\"without\"**.\n\nBeing and non-being **interdependently arise**, transformations **ceaselessly unfold**, and names **shift accordingly**—how could this be called **\"eternal named\"**?\n\nThe **mere presence or absence of \"without\" (无)** is **insufficient to discuss the Dao**.\nIf one insists on calling it **\"without\"**, one risks **falling into the void of empty stillness (空寂)**.\nThen, where does **the myriad transformations of heaven and earth** truly **originate**?\n\nNow, when it is said **\"the nameless\"**, it is only because **it is tranquil and boundless**, **formless and beyond naming**.\nYet, within **this formlessness and namelessness**, the **principles of heaven and earth and all things** are **fully inherent**—this is why it **cannot be directly called \"without\"**.\n\nThe Dao **cannot be named**; only the sage **refrains from speaking** can suffice.\nIf one **must establish speech**, then **naming is necessary** to **reveal its Dao**.\nYet there is fear that scholars **will cling to words and phrases**, **boxing the Dao into rigid definitions**—\nhence the Canon **first declares at the beginning**:\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\"*\nIts meaning is **profound indeed**.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"What of 'eternal without desire' and 'eternal with desire'?\"*\nEarlier masters often took **\"eternal without\" (常无) and \"eternal with\" (常有)** as standalone couplets,\nbut even this is not correct—why?\n\nI say: **\"The sage’s heart never truly has desire**;\nwhen it is said **\"eternal with desire\"**, it is only **referring to the point where desire arises**.\n\nWhen **still and non-acting (静而无为)**, it is **eternal without desire**.\nWhen **responding to things and moving**, though **never truly departing from stillness (静)**,\nyet **in all affairs and matters**, there are **boundaries, edges, and limits that become visible**—\n**visible**, hence **opposing \"eternal without desire\"** is called **\"eternal with desire\"**.\n\nDesire is **like the heart’s spontaneous inclinations that exceed measure (从心所欲不逾矩)**.\nMaster Zhū Wén Gōng (朱文公) also answered Master Shěn Zhuāng Zhòng (沈庄仲) this way.\n\n**The \"boundary\" (徼)** is the edge, like a boundary—this is what is meant by the **point of response**.\nFormerly, people would **make a single couplet of \"eternal without, eternal with\"**,\nbut it is **better to see it as \"eternal without desire, eternal with desire\"** alone.\n\nIf one **must insist on framing \"eternal without, eternal with\" as a couplet**,\nthen **\"eternal without\" risks collapsing into the rigid void of annihilation (断灭之顽空)**,\nwhile **\"eternal with\" falls into the stubborn clinging of fixed dispositions (执滞之常情)**—\nhow could this **suffice to observe the Dao’s profound essence and function**?\n\nMoreover, if **\"eternal without\" is the couplet**,\nyet the following text says *\"desire to observe its mystery\"*—\nthen **in the time of \"eternal without\"**, how can one **also call it \"desire\"**?\n\nSomeone asked: *\"These two—same source yet different names—\nare often taken as couplets with 'them' (者), or sometimes the 'same' (同) is attached to the previous phrase—why?\"*\n\nI say: Since the **beginning of this chapter distinguishes Dao and qi (炁) by \"nameless\" and \"named\" (无名有名)**,\nand then **divides essence and function by \"eternal without desire\" and \"eternal with desire\" (无欲有欲)**,\nit is **only proper at the end to merge and conclude them**.\n\nThough **Dao and qi, essence and function, are inherently distinct**,\nthey were **never originally separate as two distinct things**.\nOnly when **\"the boundary\" (徼) is absent**, then **Dao is without qi**; when **qi is without Dao**, then **Dao lacks a place to dwell**.\nWithout **essence**, **function cannot operate**; without **function**, **essence cannot be revealed**.\n\nDao **governs qi yet is not confined by qi**,\nfunction **depends on essence yet truly originates from essence**—\nDao is **essence itself**, qi is **function itself**.\nSince **essence and function share one source**,\nand **principles and affairs are undivided**,\nhence it is said: *\"These two...\"* and so forth.\n\nThough **it is the boundless, void essence (冲漠无眹之体)**,\nyet **the luminous functions of affairs and principles (昭然事物之用)** are **already complete**.\n\nThough **it is the functions of all affairs and principles (事事物物之用)**,\nyet **the tranquil, trace-less essence (漠然无朕之体)** does not **contradict**.\n\nYet **movement and stillness differ in name**,\nand **principles and affairs must be divided**—\nthus, **stillness, namelessness, and without desire (静而无名无欲)** is **essence**,\nwhile **movement, namedness, and with desire (动而有名有欲)** is **function**—\nhence it is called **\"different names\"**.\n\nThis is **essence as stillness becoming function in movement**—\n**not pointing to two separate origins of movement and stillness**,\nnor **placing essence and function in absolute distinction**.\nHence it is said: *\"These two share the same source yet differ in name.\"*\n\nBecause **they share one source yet differ in name**,\nthey **encompass essence and function**, **thread movement and stillness**,\n**mysteriously unified**, yet **leaving no trace to point to**—\nthis is why they are called **\"the same Profound (玄) indeed\"**.\n\n「The Master Guan Yin said that which cannot be tilted or divided,\nhence it is called **Heaven (天)**, **Fate (命)**, **Spirit (神)**, **Profound (玄)**—\nall together, it is the **Dao/Way (道)**.\n\nThus, what is called **Profound (玄)** is merely a word to describe it,\nand yet **it transcends stagnant attachment to the Profound (玄)**,\nendlessly transforming—so profound indeed.\n\nAll under Heaven know **beauty (美)** as beauty,\nand thus it becomes **ugliness (恶)**;\nall know **good (善)** as good,\nand thus it becomes **not-good (不善)**.\n\nOnce **names are applied (才涉定名)**,\noppositions arise.\nThey **interact and oppose each other (相因相轧)**,\nlike a cycle without end.\nThus, **the opposites of having and not-having (有无)** generate each other,\n**difficult and easy (难易)** complete each other,\n**long and short (长短)** define each other,\n**high and low (高下)** incline toward each other,\n**sounds and tones (声音)** harmonize with each other,\n**before and after (前后)** follow each other.\n*Harmony (和)*, with a falling tone.\nThese six pairs,\n**arise through their mutual dependence (相因而有)**.\n\nTherefore, the **Sage (圣人)** acts in **non-action (无为)**,\nand practices **teaching without words (不言之教)**.\n*Act (处)*, with a rising tone.\nThis **non-action (无为)**,\nis simply **not favoring one extreme (一偏)**,\nthus the six pairs **cannot arise (不得而有)**.\n\nAll things **act without complaint (作而不辞)**,\nthis is **nothing that is not done (无不为)**.\n\n**Give birth yet do not possess (生而不有)**,\n**act yet do not rely on (为而不恃)**,\n**accomplish yet do not claim (功成不居)**.\nThis is the **great transformation of the Dao (大而化之)**.\n\nOnly because **they do not claim (不居)**,\nis it that **they do not depart (不去)**.\n*This (夫)*, pronounced *fú*.\nThus is the way of the **Sage (圣人)**.\n\nOnly **non-action is natural (无为自然)**,\nso what is there to claim or depart from?\n\nThe **two preceding chapters (右二章)**,\nMaster He Shang named **\"Nurturing Life (养身)\"**,\nthis chapter **advances the scholar to the realm of forgetting both name and trace (名迹两忘)**.\n\nDo not **exalt the virtuous (不尚贤)**,\nso the people do not **contend (争)**;\ndo not **value hard-to-obtain wealth (难得之货)**,\nso the people do not **become thieves (为盗)**;\ndo not **perceive what is desirable (不见可欲)**,\nso the **heart does not become disordered (心不乱)**.\n*Exalt the virtuous (尚贤)*, is a **name (名)**;\n*value wealth (贵货)*, is **profit (利)**.\nOnly **without bias (无所徇)**,\ndoes the **heart not stray outward (心不外驰)**.\n\nWhat is called **not perceiving what is desirable (不见可欲)**,\nis not **sealing the eyes (胶其目)** to not see,\nbut **to make all things before one’s eyes (万境之维乎吾前)**,\nyet **not see them as desirable (不见其有可欲之处)**,\nthen **emotion does not cling to things (情不附物)**,\nand **this heart becomes clear (此心澄然)**.\n\nThus, **the Sage’s governance (圣人之治)**,\n**empties the heart (虚其心)**,\n**fills the belly (实其腹)**,\n**weakens the will (弱其志)**,\n**strengthens the bones (强其骨)**.\nAlways **making the people without knowledge and without desire (常使民无知无欲)**,\n*Strong (强)*, pronounced *qúliáng*.\n**Knowledge (知)**, as the character reads.\n\n**Emptying the heart (虚心)**,\nis **forgetting both self and things (物我兼忘)**;\n**filling the belly (实腹)**,\nis **guarding the spirit internally (精神内守)**.\n**Forgetting both self and things (物我兼忘)**,\nthen **concerns do not arise (虑不萌)** and **the will is naturally weakened (志自弱)**;\n**guarding the spirit internally (精神内守)**,\nthen **the qi does not diminish (气不馁)** and **the bones are naturally strengthened (骨自强)**.\n**Emptying the heart and weakening the will (虚心弱志)**,\nthen **the people are naturally without knowledge (民自无知)**;\n**filling the belly and strengthening the bones (实腹强骨)**,\nthen **the people are naturally without desire (民自无欲)**.\n\nThus, **those who know (知者)** do not **dare to act (不敢为)**.\n**Acting in non-action (为无为)**,\nthen **nothing remains ungoverned (无不治)**.\n\n**The Way of Sound (夫音扶)**\n\n**Knowing sound (知音智)**,\nthe **Dao/Way** of the **Sage (圣人)** is **internally applied to govern oneself (内以之治身)**,\nand **externally applied to govern others (外以之治人)**—\nall such.\n\nAs **Zhuangzi (庄子)** said:\n*\"Wander the heart in simplicity (游心於淡),\nunite the qi with emptiness (合气於漠),\nfollow things naturally (顺物自然),\nwithout harboring private concerns (无容私焉),*\nand the **world is governed (天下治)**—\nthis is it.\n\n**The following three chapters (右三章)**,\n**River Upper (河上)** named **Peaceful Governance (安民)**.\nThis chapter speaks of **forgetting the pursuit of honor (忘贵尚)**,\nand **erasing thoughts and concerns (泯思虑)**,\nso that **one returns to non-action (复无为)**,\nand **aligns with ultimate truth (合至理)**.\n\n**The Dao/Way is vast yet applied (道冲而用之)**—\nsometimes **it does not fill (或不盈)**.\n**Profound (渊兮)**, it **seems like the origin of all things (似万物之宗)**.\n**The Dao’s essence is vast and empty (道体冲虚)**,\n**indifferent and without trace (漠然无朕)**,\nyet **its application encompasses all without exception (而其用则无所不该)**.\nThough **the greatness of heaven and earth (天地)**,\nand **the abundance of movement and growth (动植)**,\nall exist within it—\n**it is never exhausted by their measure (亦莫盈其量矣)**.\n\nFor **form is limited (形有限)**, yet **principle is boundless (理无穷)**—\nthis is **the Dao’s greatness without end (道之大而无外)**,\n**a treasure that never fills (宝不盈也)**.\nYet **its subtlety is also without interior (然而其细亦无内)**,\nso though **a single thing or matter (一物一事)**,\n**none escape its full possession (莫不各具)**, not even **a hair’s breadth (毫发不遗)**.\nThus, **one must necessarily examine this closely (必近察乎此)**,\nand **not recklessly abandon the heart to empty wonder (不可一向驰心空妙)**,\nlest **one seek what is called vast yet unfilling (以求其所谓大而不盈者)**—\nhence **it says \"sometimes\" (故云或也)**.\n**\"Sometimes\" (或)** means **doubt (疑)**.\n\nAgain, **it continues (又继之)**:\n*\"Profound (渊兮), it seems like the origin of all things (似万物之宗)***—\n**profound (渊)** is the **name for that which is empty, clear, deep, and tranquil (虚澄深静而不可测)**.\nThis is **why it is called the origin of all things (所以为万物之宗)**,\n**its nature inherently indefinable (本然不可定名)**—\nhence **it says \"seems\" (故云似也)**.\nFor **when observing all things (即万物而观)**,\nthere must be **something that serves as their sovereign (必有以为之宗主者)**,\nyet **in truth there is never a fixed form (而实未尝有方体也)**.\n\n**Dull its sharpness (挫其锐)**,\n**untangle its complexity (解其纷)**,\n**harmonize its brilliance (和其光)**,\n**unify its dust (同其尘)**.\n**Serene (湛兮)**, yet **seems as if it might exist (似或存)**.\n**All things possess this Dao (物莫不有是道)**,\nbut **only humans can fully embody it (而人独能全之)**—\nthus, **the teachings of the highest Sage instruct people to cultivate it (故上圣教人修之)**,\nto **attain its fullness (以极其全也)**.\n\n**Sharpness (锐)** is **that which projects human talent and wisdom outward (人之才智外形而有芒角)**,\n**complexity (纷)** is **that which entangles affairs in myriad details (事之节目繁会而盘错)**.\n**Dulling (挫)** means **grinding and polishing to remove its jagged edges (磨砻以去其圭角)**,\nso that **its inherent wholeness remains (而本然圆成者自若矣)**.\n**Untangling (解)** is like **the butcher’s skill in dissecting (犹庖丁之理解)**—\n**complexity (纷)** is **its myriad strands (其族)**.\nWhen **it is fully severed (及乎磔然已解)**,\nand **stillness is unbroken (而静一不紊)**—\n**its nature remains (自若矣)**.\nThis is **cultivation in outward matters (修於外)**,\nto **nourish what lies within (以养其中)**.\n\n**Harmonizing its brilliance (和其光)**,\nthen **it shines without dazzling (光矣而不耀)**.\n**Unifying its dust (同其尘)**,\nthen **it encompasses all things as one (磅砖万物以为一)**.\nThis is **unity within (一於内)** to **respond to the outside (以应其外)**—\nwhen **it reaches its utmost (及其至也)**,\n**inner and outer are as one (内外一如)**,\nand **only then does the whole, undivided body reside in me (浑然之全体在我)**,\n**serene and ever present (湛然常脊矣)**.\n**Seems as if it might exist (似或存)**—\n**it dares not be directly pointed at (不敢正指)**.\nFor **the Dao has no fixed form (道无定体)**,\nyet **grasping at it leads to loss (执之则失矣)**.\n\n**I do not know whose child the Dao is (吾不知谁之子)**,\nyet **it precedes the Sovereign (象帝之先)**.\n**The Dao is the mother of heaven, earth, and all things (道者，天地万物之母)**—\nhence **it says \"I do not know whose child\" (故曰不知谁之子)**.\n**Form (象)** is **the beginning of the tangible (有形之始)**,\n**the Sovereign (帝)** is **the master of the manifest (有物之主)**.\n**It precedes (先)** refers to **before there was form or manifestation (其未有形有物之前)**.\n\n**The following four chapters (右四章)**,\n**River Upper (河上)** named **The Source-less (无源)**.\nThis chapter **illuminates the subtle origin (明妙本)**,\n**vast and empty (冲虚)**, yet **its application is unfathomable (而其用不测)**.\n\n**Heaven and earth are not \"仁\" (天地不仁)**,\nyet **they treat all things as fodder for horses and dogs (以万物为刍狗)**;\n**the Sage is not \"仁\" (圣人不仁)**,\nyet **they treat the people as fodder for horses and dogs (以百姓为刍狗)**.\n\n**\"仁\" (仁)** is **the root of life (生之本)**,\n**the principle of love (爱之理)**—\n**the greatest virtue of the Three Powers (三才之大德)**.\nWhat is called **\"not仁\" (不仁)** is **not clinging to仁 (不滞於仁)**,\njust as **the highest virtue is not virtue (上德不德)**.\n\nFor **the constant of heaven and earth (天地之常)** is **to embrace all things universally (以其心普万物)** yet **without heart (而无心)**;\n**the constant of the Sage (圣人之常)** is **to conform to all affairs (以其情顺万事)** yet **without emotion (而无情)**.\nThus, **they are not bound by present concerns (不系累於当时)**,\nnor **entangled by past affections (不留情於既往)**—\nlike **bundling fodder for sacrificial dogs (犹束刍为狗)**,\n**ceremonial rites (祭祀之仪)**,\n**used at the proper time (适时而用)**,\n**discarded when the ritual is done (已事而弃)**—\nhow could **they harbor attachment (岂容心哉)**?\nThis is **the utmost of selflessness (此无私之极)**,\n**the peak of仁 (仁之至也)**.\n\nBetween **heaven and earth (天地之间)**,\n**it is like the bellows (橐钥)**.\n**Bellows (橐)**, pronounced *tú* (他各切),\n**is a leather bag (鞴)**.\n**Tube (钥)**, pronounced *yào* (音药),\n**is a pipe (管)**—\n**a thing that can receive wind and air (能受气鼓风之物)**.\nBetween **heaven and earth (天地之间)**,\n**the two qi move in and out, bending and stretching (二气往来屈伸)**—\njust as **this thing is empty yet receptive (虚而能受)**,\n**responding without storing (应而不藏)**.\n**Empty yet unyielding (虚而不屈)**,\n**moving yet ever emerging (动而愈出)**.\n**River Upper (河上)** and **Lu (陆)** both **interpret屈 as竭 (释屈作竭)**.\n**Zhu Wenzhong (朱文公)** said:\n*\"If it does not receive a single thing (有一物之不受)**,\nthen **it is empty yet yielding (虚而屈)**.\nIf **it does not respond to a single thing (有一物之不应)**,\nthen **it moves yet cannot emerge (动而不能出)**.\n**Many words exhaust meaning (多言数穷)**,\n**better to hold fast to the center (不如守中)**.\"\n**数 (数)**, pronounced *shuò* (音朔), means **repeatedly (屡)**.\n**Sima Wengong (司马温公)** said:\n*\"One who can **hold fast to the center with sincerity (守中诚)***\n**is believed without speech (不言而信)**.\"\n**Su Wendingong (苏文定公)** said:\n*\"Seeing **its movement yet ever emerging (动而愈出)**,\n**one does not know it is the response of the empty center (不知其为虚中之报)**—\nhence **he tells this (故告之云云)**.\"\n\n**The following five chapters (右五章)**,\n**River Upper (河上)** named **The Empty Application (虚用)**.\nThis chapter **first cites the affairs of heaven, earth, and the Sage (先以天地圣人之事)**,\nand **draws analogies from distant things (及远取诸物)**,\nto **illustrate their selflessness and non-action (以明其无私无为)**.\nOnce **the body of the empty center is established (虚中之体既立)**,\nthen **its application naturally ceases not (则其用自然不息)**.\nOne **cannot merely follow its application (不可徒徇於用)**,\nwithout **returning to seek its root (而不知反求其本之所以然)**—\nthus **it teaches to speak little and hold fast to the center (故教之讷言守中)**,\nas **the gateway to entering virtue (以为入德之门)**.\n\n**The center (中)** is **the Dao itself (即道也)**—\n**its body is round and unified with the Great Emptiness (即其体则圆同太虚)**,\n**standing alone without deviation (卓然而无所偏倚)**.\n**Its application flows without interruption (以其用则周流无间)**—\n**in all things and matters (在於事物)**,\n**it is neither excessive nor deficient (各无过不及)**.\n**To hold fast (守)** is **the matter of learning to seek its utmost (学以求至者)**.\nWhen **its functions are perfected (及乎功用纯熟)**,\n**then holding fast is naturally cast aside (则守底瞥地脱落)**,\n**its essence is clear (当体澄然)**,\nand **the center stands firm (中斯立焉)**.\n\nSome say **the center (中)** refers to **the Central Palace (中宫黄庭)** and **the Great Abyss of the North Pole (北极太渊)**—\nmeaning **to store the spirit in the Central Palace (存神中宫)**,\n**so as to nourish the fetal essence (所以养胎元)**,\n**and inherit the essence of the qi-mother (袭气母之要)**.\nThis is **also speaking of the center in terms of form and vessel (此又就形器而言中)**—\njust as **the North Pole resides in the center of heaven (北极在天之中)**,\n**dwelling in its place (居其所)** as **the pivot of the primal unity (为玄浑之枢纽)**,\nso **the center (中)**—\n**thus it is that the center can be implied and seen (于是乎有以寓而可见矣)**.\"\n\nYet the **pivot and hinge** by which it operates,\nand the **Primordial Transformation** by which it never ceases,\nare **indeed reliant upon the center** alone.\n\nIf one perceives it thoroughly,\nthen **whether spoken of as horizontal or vertical**,\nit is **all contained within**.\n\n**The Valley Spirit does not die**—this is called the **Mysterious Female**.\nThe **Valley Spirit** refers to **its form being void yet receptive to all things**,\nwhile **its function responds yet remains unfathomable**.\nSince it **governs the threads of transformation**,\nflowing through past and future,\nwondrously encompassing all things while **endlessly generating life**,\nit is thus called **undying**.\nThis is the **true One’s essence**,\nthe **master of yin and yang**—\nhence, the **Mysterious Female**.\nThis speaks of **principle inhering in qi**—\nthe **Mysterious Male** and the **Female Yin**.\n\nFor the **Male transforms into the Mysterious**, beyond measure,\nwhile the **Female unites to generate endlessly**—\nthus it is said.\n\n**Master Wen** remarked:\n*\"The most subtle principle carries the intent of endless generation.\"*\nHence, **Master Cheng** adopted this teaching.\n\nThe **Gate of the Mysterious Female** is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\nThe **Gate** is the **portal to all marvels**,\nfrom which **Heaven, Earth, and all things emerge**.\nThe **Root** is like the root of plants—\ninvisible to mortals,\nyet the **true source of endless generation**.\nIt refers to **the opening and closing of yin and yang** as the **foundation of Heaven and Earth**.\nIn the human body, it is the **Primordial Palace and the Female Repository**—\nthe **convergence of spirit and qi**,\nwhere **Heaven and Earth share the same root**.\n\n**Master Cao Dao-Chong** said:\n*\"The Mysterious is the **dim and hidden**, where the spirit is stored**.\nThe Female is the **gentle and harmonious**, where the qi is stored**.\n**Continuous as if ever-present**,\nits use requires no exertion.\"*\n\n**Master Cao** further explained:\n*\"Continuous\" means **unbroken harmony**.\nThe **Way values non-action**—\nto call it *having* is rigidity,\nto call it *not having* is dullness—\nthus, it is said to be *as if ever-present*.\"*\n\n**Master Wen Ding** stated:\n*\"Continuous—**subtle yet unbroken**.\nAs if ever-present—**present yet unseen**.*\nHe who embodies this\n**need not labor even if using it all day**.\"*\n\n---\n**The Sixth Chapter**—*River Above, named Cheng Xiang.*\nThis chapter speaks of **the Dao’s essence and function**,\n**the qi’s yin and yang**,\n**the form’s motion and stillness**—\nand how **humans embody it**.\n\nFor **only through the Mysterious Female’s endless generation**\ndoes one **know the Valley Spirit’s immortality**.\nAnd **only through Heaven and Earth’s constant motion and stillness**\ndoes one **recognize the Mysterious Female’s work**.\n\nThe **Valley Spirit** is spoken of in terms of **principle**,\nthe **Mysterious Female** in terms of **qi**,\nand **Heaven and Earth** in terms of **form**.\nThe **Dao’s wondrous function**\ndoes not exceed **yin and yang**,\nyet its **reason for being**\nis **never dependent on yin and yang**—\nrather, it **governs qi and form**, **penetrating all without obstruction**.\n\nSomeone asked:\n*\"The* Ling Shu *says:\n*'The Heavenly Valley Spirit—guard it, and it remains true.\nAbove, the Mysterious; below, the Female—child and mother in harmony.\nThe nose is the Mysterious—drawing qi upward to connect with Heaven;\nthe mouth is the Female—receiving saliva downward to connect with Earth.'*\nYet you reject this teaching—why?\"*\n\nThe reply:\n*\"This is **limited to the human body alone**,\nwhile this chapter **traces directly to the origin of all transformations**.\nThe **Dao governs yin and yang**, **generates Heaven and Earth**—\nyet the **governance of yin and yang** is **human nature**,\nand the **qi of Heaven and Earth** is **the human body**—\nthus, **near analogies from the body** reflect the same principle.\nFrom the **mouth and nose theories**, later alchemists elaborated,\nand **later scholars** made it **ever more fragmented**.\nAs **Zhang Ping-Shu** said:\n*'The Gate of the Mysterious Female few know—\nonly to rely on mouth and nose in vain.\nRao the Master practiced inhalation a thousand times—\nhow could he grasp the Golden Rooster and Jade Rabbit?'*\n\n**Shao Dao-Guang** wrote:\n*'The Gate of the Mysterious Female—know it well,\nyet few dare to begin.\nYou still doubt the logic of immortality—\njust look between the frost and the dawn.'*\n\n**Master Zhu** declared:\n*'The Gate of the Mysterious Female is called the Golden Mother,\n**Prior to Heaven and Earth, it hides the True Soil**.\n**Embrace the Primordial, hold the breath—thus life is born**,\n**One qi, void yet eternal through ages**.\nAgain, he said:\n*'If mortals would recognize the True Mysterious Female,\nit is **not in the heart nor in the kidneys**.\n**Trace the origin of life’s received qi**—\ndo not blame the **Heavenly Mechanism** for leaking entirely.'*\n\n**Master Lü Chongyang** composed:\n*'The Gate of the Mysterious Female is hard to speak of—\nfrom ancient times, here **Kun and Qian** unite.\nThe **Hall of Jade** is called the **Communing Sage**,\nthe **Golden Pit** is the **Mysterious Principle**.\nIts use is like **the Sun’s spirit entering the Moon’s body**,\nits arrival like **the sea’s pulse surging as a spring tide**.\nOnce the mechanism is understood, all is effortless—\n**a youth roams ten thousand miles, unbound**.'*\n\nThough these **alchemical schools** consider it the **ultimate marvel**,\ntheir **core intent** has already been **expressed in the preface**.\n\n*The Liezi* records:\n*\"The Yellow Emperor’s text says...\"*—\n**fully quoting this entire chapter**.\nFor **ancient texts existed**, yet **Laozi only transmitted them**.\nAnd **Master Ge Xian Gong’s** *Inner Transmission* states:\n*\"In the Yellow Emperor’s time, the Old Master was Guangchengzi,\nwho expounded this scripture for the Emperor—\nthus the Emperor recorded it, citing this chapter.\"*\n\n---\n**Heaven endures, Earth persists.**\n**Heaven and Earth endure long**\nbecause **they do not generate themselves**—\nthus they **endure in generation**.\n**The non-generating is the source of generation**—\nhence, **\"endless generation\"** refers to **the non-generating**.\n\nAll **adornments of form and number**\nmust have **limits and measures**.\nYet when it is said that **\"Heaven endures, Earth persists\"**\nit is **only from the perspective of mortal sight**.\n\nThus, the **Sage** **delays the self** yet **the self precedes**;\n**abandons the self** yet **the self is preserved**.\nThis is **bending oneself to forget the ego**—\n**not for private gain or selfish profit**,\nbut the **natural unfolding of principle and circumstance**.\nFor **humility brings radiance**,\n**forgetting the form brings longevity**.\nIs this not **selflessness**?\nThus, **private concerns are fulfilled**.\n\nThe **Heavenly and Earthly** do not vie with things for life,\nthe **Sage** does not contend with others for virtue—\nthus they **transcend mortals**.\n\nThe **most impartial principle** is unalterable and enduring—\nthis is the **Way of lastingness**.\n\n**Chapter Eight**—*Riverbank* names it **\"Concealing One’s Brilliance.\"**\nThis chapter elucidates the **doctrine of selflessness**—\nthe **Dao of enduring**.\n\n**The highest excellence is like water.**\nWater excels in benefiting all things yet does not contend—\nwhat mortals despise is **closest to the Dao**.\n\n*处 (chǔ)*, upper tone.\n*恶 (wù)*, departing tone.\n*几 (jī)*, near—**almost**.\n\nTo **guard softness and dwell low** is what the vulgar despise,\nyet truly **closest to the Dao**.\nBut if adorned with form, it **falls short of the Dao**—\nhence, **\"almost.\"**\n\nTo **dwell well** is to **humble oneself** and **nurture the self**—\nlike descending to the lowly.\n\nTo **cultivate the heart’s depth**—\nstillness brings clarity and emptiness—\nthese are all **first preserving one’s essence**.\n\nOnly with **humility, modesty, and tranquil depth** as virtue\ndo the five functions unfold.\n\n**To give generously**—\nto **share with emptiness yet not with fullness**,\nto **broadly bestow without seeking return**—\nthis is **selflessness alone**.\n\n**To speak well**—\nsincere words **need no oaths to align**,\nlike tides that **never fail**—\nwhen blocked, they cease; when released, they flow,\ndiscerning beauty and ugliness without error,\ntraversing perilous paths without loss.\n\n**To govern well**—\nto

names it **\"The Capacity to Act.\"**\nThis chapter speaks of **non-duality**.\n\n如刘泾曰：黄帝云：动以营生谓之魂。\nAs **Liú Jīng** says:\n**The Yellow Emperor** declared:\n**\"To move while nurturing life is called the soul (hún).\"**\n\n碧虚曰：营，魂也。\n**Bì Xū** said:\n**\"The vital essence (yíng) is the soul (hún).\"**\n\n《白虎通》云：营营，不定貌也。\nThe *Bái Hǔ Tōng* states:\n**\"The vital essence (yíng) is the form of restless fluctuation.\"**\n\n载（zài），乘（chéng）也。\n**To bear**—\n**to ride**.\n\n谓使形常乘载魂魄，抱守太和纯一之气，\n**Meaning to let the form always ride upon the soul and spirit**—\n**to embrace and preserve the harmonious, pure qi**—\n\n令无散离也。\n**so that it does not disperse**.\n\n文定曰：圣人性定而神凝，\n**Wén Dìng** says:\n**The Sage’s nature is steadfast** while **the spirit is concentrated**—\n\n不为物迁，虽以魄为舍，\n**not swayed by things**, though **the spirit is the dwelling**—\n\n而神欲行，魄无不从，\n**when the spirit wishes to move**, the **spirit never fails to follow**—\n\n则神常载魄矣。\nthen **the spirit always rides upon the essence**.\n\n众人以物役性，神昏而不治，\n**Common folk let things enslave their nature**—\ntheir **spirit grows dim and unrefined**—\n\n则神听於魄。\nthen **the spirit submits to the essence**.\n\n耳目用於声色，口鼻劳於臭味。\n**Eyes and ears are used for sounds and colors**—\n**mouth and nose are strained by smells and tastes**.\n\n魄所欲行而神从之，则魄常载神矣。\n**Where the essence wishes to move**, the **spirit follows**—\nthen **the essence always rides upon the spirit**.\n\n故教之以抱神载魄，使两者不相离也。\nThus **the teaching is to embrace the spirit and ride upon the essence**—\n**to ensure the two never separate**.\n\n文公曰：以车承人谓之载，\n**Wén Gōng** says:\n**\"To bear\" means to let a carriage support a person**—\nthis is **common parlance**.\n\n以人登车亦谓之载，则古文史类多有之。\n**To let a person ascend a carriage** is also called **\"to bear\"**—\nmany ancient texts use this **metaphor**.\n\n如《汉纪》云：刘章从谒者与载。\nAs in the *Hàn Jì*:\n**\"Liú Zhāng followed the attendants and rode.\"**\n\n韩集云：妇人以孺子载。\nThe *Hán Jí* states:\n**\"A woman carried a child.\"**\n\n盖皆此意。\n**All follow this meaning**.\n\n营者，字与荧同，而为晶明光炯之意。\n**The vital essence (yíng)**—\nits character is the same as *yíng* (as in \"radiance\")—\nbut it means **clear and luminous**.\n\n其所谓魄，亦若予论於《九歌》耳。\n**The spirit (pò)**—\nthis is as **I discussed in the *Jiǔ Gē* (Nine Songs)**.\n\n盖以魂阳动而魄阴静，\n**For the soul is yang and active**, while **the spirit is yin and still**—\n\n魂火二、而魄水一，\n**the soul is like two flames**, while **the spirit is like one water**—\n\n谓以魂加魄，以动守静，\n**meaning to let the soul govern the spirit**—\n**to let the active preserve the still**—\n\n以火迫水，以二守一，\n**to let fire press upon water**—\n**to let the dual guard the singular**—\n\n而不相离，如人登车而常载於其上，\n**without separation**, like a **person ascending a carriage**—\n**always riding upon it**—\n\n则魂安静而魄精明，\nthen **the soul is tranquil** while **the spirit is refined**—\n\n火不燥而水不缢，\n**the flames do not scorch** and **the water does not dry**—\n\n固长生久视之要也。\n\nBut those who explain it fail to delve deeply. When **Hé Shàng Gōng** takes *yíng* as the soul, this is not only incorrect in terms of the character’s meaning, but he also speaks of a person carrying the soul and spirit upon a carriage to attain life, urging their care—this is also a misinterpretation of the text’s intent. Only his understanding of the character *zài* (載) is roughly correct.\n\nIf **Wáng Fǔsì** takes *zài* to mean \"to reside,\" and regards *yíng-pò* as the place where a person habitually dwells, this is also in line with Hé Shàng’s view. Yet in later times, **Sū Shìyóu** and **Wáng Yuànzé** offered their own interpretations. **Hóng Qìngshàn** also claimed that when yang-qi fills the spirit, it becomes the soul, and if the soul can move, life is preserved. Yet all these interpretations take *zài* to mean \"to carry a person upon a carriage,\" which not only contradicts the text’s meaning but would also force the spirit to labor constantly while the soul never rests. Though one might avoid the burdens of material desires, in the depths of obscurity, the refined unity of essence would instead be seized by excessive yang, driving it through chaotic and entangled paths—ultimately falling into the realm where ordinary people harm their vitality and shorten their lives, unaware.\n\nIn *Jiǔ Gē Biànzhèng*, someone asked about the meaning of soul and spirit, and replied:\n**Zǐ Chǎn** said: *\"When a thing first takes form, it is called spirit (pò); once born, the spirit becomes yang and is called soul (hún).\"*\n**Confucius** said: *\"Qi is the manifestation of the spirit.\"*\n*\"The spirit is the essence of the ghost.\"*\n**Zhèng Xī’s commentary** states: *\"The inhaling and exhaling is qi. The clarity of the ears and eyes is the spirit. Qi is what is called the soul.\"*\n\n*The Huáinánzǐ* says: *\"Heavenly qi is the soul; earthly qi is the spirit.\"*\n**Gāo Yòu’s commentary** explains: *\"The soul is the yang-spirit of man; the spirit is the yin-spirit of man.\"*\nThese several explanations elaborate the meaning of soul and spirit well.\n\nIndeed, when it says *\"a thing first takes form\"* (物生始化), it means that at the moment of receiving form, when vital essence and blood gather, the luminous aspect among them is called *spirit*. When it says *\"once born, the spirit becomes yang and is called soul\"* (既生魄阳曰魂), it means that once the spirit is born, there arises a warm vitality, and the divine aspect among them is called *soul*. Only when these two unite does a thing come into being—this is what the *Yì* means by *\"refined qi forms things.\"*\n\nWhen they disperse, the soul wanders as spirit, and the spirit descends as ghost. Yet those who explain it do not consider this, and merely rely on **Zuǒ Zhū’s commentary**, which divides the divine and luminous into yin and yang. Though this seems reasonable, to take the inhaling and exhaling as the spirit is incorrect. His statement that *\"the luminous attached to form is the spirit, the divine attached to qi is the soul\"* is closer to the truth, but his claim that *\"the spirit’s cognition is limited while the soul’s cognition is vast\"* is wrong. They merely differ in their functions of movement and storage.\n\n**Yáng Zhīzhōng** further explains this through the luminosity of the sun and moon, asserting that the moon’s substance is the spirit, while the sun’s radiance is the soul. He says the sun’s light illuminates the moon’s spirit, just as a person ascends a carriage and rides upon it. Hence, *\"when the moon is not yet full, the spirit is carried westward.\"* When full, *\"the spirit terminates eastward,\"* tending toward the sun. This means that when the moon is waxing, the sun’s light shines upon the spirit’s western side, gradually filling its eastern side until it reaches fullness. Once full, the sun’s light guards the spirit’s eastern side, gradually diminishing its western side until it wanes and vanishes. The moon’s brilliance depends on its proximity to the sun—before fullness, the sun is to its right; after fullness, to its left. Thus, it faces whichever direction the light comes from, like the people turning toward their ruler’s transformation to form customs. This is the doctrine of soul and spirit.\n\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at one hub; though the hub is empty, it fulfills the carriage’s use.\"*\n**Fú** (輻) is pronounced *fú*, and **gǔ** (毂) is the hollow center of the wheel, made of many hard woods. **Gǔ** is pronounced *gǔ* (古木切), meaning the outer part where all spokes meet, hollow inside to receive the axle as its pivot. **Dāng** (當) is pronounced *dāng* (丁浪切), meaning \"just so.\" The \"empty\" refers to the hollow space, meaning that the spokes and hub combine to form a carriage, and it is this central void that makes the carriage functional. **Wén Gōng** said: *\"The empty is the hollow within the hub.\"* Only because it is empty within can it receive the axle and turn endlessly. This is what **Zhuāngzǐ** meant when he said: *\"The pivot begins to find its circular center, responding to the boundless.\"*\n\n*\"Mixing clay to make a vessel: though it is empty, it fulfills the vessel’s use.\"*\n**Suō** (埏) is pronounced *suō* (始然切), meaning \"to blend earth,\" and **zhí** (埴) is pronounced *zhí* (市力切), meaning \"sticky clay\"—both are the work of potters. This too relies on the vessel’s inner emptiness to contain things, making it a useful vessel. The meaning below is the same.\n\n*\"Piercing doors and windows to make a room: though it is empty, it fulfills the room’s use.\"*\n**Záo** (凿) means \"to bore.\" A half-door is called *hù* (户), and a window beside the door is called *yǒu* (牖). Thus, what is \"having\" is for convenience, while what is \"empty\" is for function. These three things all have outer forms to take shape, yet are hollow within to receive things. The outer form brings timely benefit, while the inner emptiness holds true, constant use. Without the empty, there would be no way to apply its benefit; without the having, there would be no way to achieve its function. Thus, form and spirit rely on each other, and having and emptiness complement one another. Yet the one who governs form and directs qi is always in the empty—this is how wondrous transformations arise, and utility is endless.\n\nThe *Yì* says: *\"If the Heaven and Earth were destroyed, there would be no way to see the *Yì*; if the *Yì* were unseen, Heaven and Earth might nearly cease to exist.\"* This conveys the same meaning.\n\n**Eleven chapters have been discussed.**\n**Hé Shàng** named this chapter *\"The Use of the Non-Use.\"*\n\nThis chapter elucidates the wondrous interplay of having and emptiness, dispelling the confusion of one-sided extremes.\n\nFive colors make the eyes blind;\nFive tones make the ears deaf;\nFive flavors make the palate lose its true taste.\n**Lìng** (令) is pronounced *lìng* (令, all level tones), meaning \"to cause.\"\n**Shuǎng** (爽) means \"to lose,\" referring to the loss of the genuine, unadulterated taste.\n\nHunting and galloping across fields drive one’s mind to madness—\nthis is when *qi* reverses and agitates the heart.\nThough the will may move *qi* nineteen times out of twenty,\nthis chapter speaks of all that which, coming from without, bewilders us.\nThus it instructs us to master the external so as to tranquilize the inner.\n\nRare and coveted goods disrupt one’s conduct.\n*\"Conduct\"* is pronounced *xíng* (行, departing tone).\nRare and coveted goods are all external things.\n*\"Disrupt\"* means to harm.\nWhen the heart clings to externals, it obstructs virtuous conduct.\nTherefore, the Sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes,\nand thus discards the former to embrace the latter.\n*\"Discards\"* (去), pronounced *qù* (mouth-ju, to scatter), here means to remove—\nnot the *qù* (去) of departure.\nThe belly contains within yet desires nothing;\nthe eyes chase what appears without and lure the inner.\nTo act for the belly is akin to the *Gèn* (艮) meaning of \"ease and retreat\";\nnot to act for the eyes aligns with the *Yīnfú* (阴符) saying, *\"The mechanism lies in the eyes.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\n*Hé Shàng* named this *\"Frugality in Desire.\"*\nThis chapter clarifies how attachment to dust and pursuit of phenomena\nall lead one astray from the true Way.\nFor the previous chapter spoke of the boundless wonders of emptiness within,\nhere it warns against being filled by external evils.\nIts essence lies in the eyes—\nthus it begins and ends with them,\nas with the six senses and six dusts, where *eye-color* ranks first.\nThe Master’s *\"Four Do Nots\"* (四勿) must first say *\"Do not gaze\"*—\nall of this meaning is the same.\n\nYet the eyes must see, the ears must hear,\nthe mouth must taste, the form must labor,\nthe heart must respond—\nthese cannot be stilled.\nOnly when movement never departs from stillness\ndoes one, though moving, not cling to things,\nand thus attain serene desirelessness.\n\nHonor and disgrace strike like alarms;\nwealth and great calamity press like the body itself.\nTo gain honor is disgrace;\nhonor is the root of disgrace—\nonly after honor does disgrace arise,\nhence it is called *\"the lesser.\"*\nTo receive it is like an alarm;\nto lose it is like an alarm—\nthis is called *\"honor and disgrace striking like alarms.\"*\nIf not aligned with the Way,\nthen gain and loss burden the heart like bells,\nand thus one is alarmed.\n\nWhat is meant by *\"wealth and great calamity press like the body itself\"*?\nThe reason I have great calamity is that I have a body.\nWhen I have no body, what calamity do I have?\n*\"For\"* is pronounced *wèi* (去, departing tone).\nThis again speaks of the body as the root of wealth and calamity—\nwithout a body, one forgets the self.\nThe previous did not reach disgrace,\nthis did not reach wealth—\nit is mutual phrasing to convey the meaning,\nand since no one fails to love wealth or hate calamity,\nit speaks only of calamity.\nThis stems from the persistence of the *self-view*;\nif one could abandon the self,\nthen naturally wealthy one walks in wealth,\nnaturally afflicted one endures affliction—\nsmooth and rugged are as one,\npleasure and pain are equal—\nthen who would further bear wealth or calamity?\n\nThus, to hold wealth as the body is to entrust it with the world;\nto love the body as the world is to commit the world to it.\nGuó Xiàng says:\n*\"If one lightly discards the body to pursue gain,\nabandons the self to serve things,\nthen the body itself cannot be secure—\nhow much less the world?\"*\nIt means one must truly cherish and love the body\nbefore one can be entrusted with the world.\nYet wealth does not reach the depth of love,\nand entrustment does not last as long as commitment.\nSome say: *\"To know how to cherish and love the body\nis to transcend the world.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\n*Hé Shàng* named this *\"Loathing Shame.\"*\nThis chapter clarifies how to discard false emotions\nand restore the true nature.\nIf one abandons honor, disgrace does not reach;\nif one forgets the body, calamity does not come.\nThe world is a great thing—\nyet even it is not a burden,\nhow much less other things?\nBut to forget the body is the study of the transcendent.\nOne who cherishes and loves the body\nyet does not let the world be a burden\nis not one bound by the *Huánghù* (yellow-roofed palace).\n\nWhat is unseen when gazed upon is called *yí* (夷);\nthe great symbol is level and smooth, without visible color.\nWhat is unheard when listened to is called *xī* (希);\nthe great sound is subtle and silent, beyond hearing.\nWhat cannot be grasped is called *wēi* (微).\n*\"Grasp\"* is pronounced *bó* (伯各).\nSubtle and formless, it is empty and cannot be held.\nThese three cannot be forced or questioned,\nso they merge into one.\n\n*\"Question\"* is pronounced *jié* (契吉).\nThe Dao is not reachable by sight, hearing, wisdom, or strength—\nit must be returned to unity before it can be attained.\nAbove, it is not bright;\nbelow, it is not dim.\n*\"Bright\"* is pronounced *jiǎo* (古晓).\nIt means that though above it does not add clarity,\nand though below it does not add obscurity,\nit is taut yet nameless,\nreturning to nothingness.\nThough taut like a cord, unbroken in motion,\nit is truly without substance to name.\n\nThis is called the *form of no-form*,\nthe *symbol of no-symbol*—\nthis is called *huǎnghǔ* (恍惚).\nWén Dìng says:\n*\"Form\"* refers to its manifestation,\n*\"symbol\"* to its subtlety.\nSince it is neither having nor not-having,\nand having and not-having cannot be fixed in name,\nit is called *huǎnghǔ*.\n\nApproach it and you see no head;\nfollow it and you see no tail.\nOnly because it lacks form and color yet flows boundlessly without end\nis it impossible to grasp or follow.\n\nTo hold the ancient Dao\nand govern the present *you* (有),\nto know the ancient beginning\nis called the *memorial of the Way*.\nTime has ancient and present,\nthe Dao has no end or beginning.\nThe Sage teaches people to embody the Dao\nto govern the body and master things—\nthat is, to take the *you* of things\nand trace it back to its original *wu* (无),\nthus grasping its root and unifying its lineage.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\n*Hé Shàng* named this *\"Praising the Mysterious.\"*\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao’s supreme subtlety thus:\nIf one hears without sound emerging,\nsees without transcending color,\nthen unless one is deluded and clinging to things,\none must abandon *you* and cling to *wu*.\nThus it repeatedly elucidates the meaning of neither approaching nor departing,\nurging one to delve deeply and attain it oneself.\n\nThe virtuous scholars of antiquity\nwere subtle, mysterious, and profound—\ndeep beyond recognition.\nWén Dìng says:\n*\"Coarse exhaustion leads to subtlety,\nsubtlety to profundity,\nprofundity to mystery,\nmystery then flows through all without measure.\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\nFor that which is beyond recognition,\none must forcefully give it form:\n**Reverent** as one who treads a winter river,\n**Cautious** as one who fears the four neighbors.\n\n**Reverent** (豫) is to forestall calamity before it arises,\nmoving with hesitation as though compelled by necessity—\nthe utmost in vigilance.\n**Cautious** (犹) is to harbor doubt in matters already done,\nlike one who cultivates virtue in secret,\nthen conceals himself in obscurity—\nthe deepest in restraint.\n\n**Dignified** as a guest,\nWén Gōng says: *\"Dignified as a guest\"*—\nthe phrasing is most precise.\nLater editions often errantly render this as *\"form\"* (容),\nutterly missing the original intent.\nMoreover, these seven lines form three rhyming couplets,\nand *\"guest\"* (客) aligns perfectly with *\"release\"* (释).\nFor whenever it says *\"as if\"* (若某),\nthere is always a tangible reality beneath—\nthe *\"guest\"* is he who does not presume to be master,\nyet remains involved in affairs,\nthus his bearing is dignified.\n\n**Dissolved** as ice about to melt,\nexteriorly composed yet interiorly expansive—\ndissolved and unconstrained by things.\n\n**Sincere** as uncarved wood,\npure and undifferentiated,\nits edges not exposed.\n\n**Vast** as a valley,\nbroad yet accommodating,\nempty yet responsive.\n\n**Turbulent** as muddy water,\nblended with the dust—\nstirring the mud while raising the waves,\nlost in the Dao’s ultimate mystery.\n\nWho can settle the muddy with slow stillness to reveal clarity?\nWho can remain at ease while in motion to nurture life?\nThose who let things muddle their nature,\nmust only stillness to clarify it,\nthen their innate purity will slowly return.\n\nThose who dwell in quiescence,\nmust only be at ease while capable of change,\nthen they will not stagnate in one corner\nand life will slowly emerge.\n\nThus, they move and rest with lively spontaneity,\nforgetting both motion and stillness.\n\nThe true keepers of this Dao\ndo not desire fullness.\nFor only the unfull can endure wear,\nwithout seeking new perfection.\n\n**Yuè Zhù’s commentary** says:\n*\"Great brightness seems like shame,\nabundant virtue seems like insufficiency.\"*\n\nTo nurture modesty and restraint to the end—\nthis is what people find difficult,\nso again it warns against pride and self-satisfaction—\nits meaning is profound.\n\nOnly by lacking self-satisfaction\ncan one always preserve the worn,\nwithout claiming credit for new achievements.\n\n*Hé Shàng* named this *\"Manifesting Virtue/Power\"* (显德).\nThis chapter’s lines are sequentially ordered,\nwith the principle of *\"fulfillment\"* (成) as master,\nand *\"as if worn\"* (若敝) as its exhaustion.\nLike **Liezi** dwelling in the **Jīng Garden** for forty years,\nwithout anyone recognizing him—\nthis is precisely the state described.\n\n**Examine** the winds of the **Western Jin**—\nhow could such a spirit ever exist?\n\n**Attain emptiness to its utmost**,\n**hold fast to stillness with sincerity**—\nemptiness and stillness forgotten,\nthis is called *\"sincerity’s utmost\"* (笃极).\n\nAll things arise together,\nI observe their return.\nThings are myriad and diverse,\neach returning to its root.\n**Myriad and diverse** (芸芸) is the appearance of motion.\nEmptiness is the root of reality,\nstillness is the root of motion—\nall things arise from nature,\nall return to nature.\nReturning to the root is stillness,\nstillness is called *\"restoring the vital breath\"* (复命).\n\nStillness is the nature of Heaven,\nthe vital breath given to me as such.\nYet when responding to things,\nit moves.\n\nOnly by harmonizing motion and stillness\ndoes motion never stray from stillness,\nand one restores their original Heavenly nature.\n\nWén Dìng says:\n*\"If one cannot yet restore themselves to nature,*\neven by ceasing motion and halting thought to seek stillness,\nthis is not stillness.*\nThus only returning to the root\ncan be called stillness.*\n\n**Vital breath** (命) is nature’s subtlety.\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"Exhausting principles, attaining nature’s subtlety, reaching vital breath\"*—\nthis is it.\n\n**Restoring vital breath** (复命) is called *\"constant\"* (常).\nNo thing can remain constant,\nyet when one reaches vital breath,\nit abides serenely and eternally.\n\n**Knowing constant** (知常) is called *\"clarity\"* (明).\nTo grasp this,\nthen clarity is attained.\nTo not know constant,\nis reckless action—\ndisaster.\nTo know constant is to be **comprehensive** (容).\n\nTo perceive the original essence,\nthen distinctions merge and barriers dissolve—\nwhat cannot be contained?\n\n**Comprehensive** (容) is **impartial** (公).\nWho then would be private?\n**Impartial** (公) is **sovereign** (王).\n\nWén Dìng says:\n*\"The world will then return to it.\"*\n\n**Sovereign** (王) is **Heaven** (天).\nHuáng Mào Cái says:\n*\"The sovereign learns from Heaven.\"*\n\n**Heaven** (天) is **Dao/Way** (道).\nHeaven follows the Dao.\n\n---\n\nWén Dìng says:\n*\"Heaven still has form,\nyet when one reaches Dao/Way, it attains its utmost.\nDao/Way is enduring—\nto labor with the body without peril.\nLiú Jìng says:\n*'This is what has always existed since antiquity.'*\n\n**Chapter XVII** — *Hé Shàng* names it *\"Returning to Root.\"*\nThis chapter states:\nWhen one awakens to this Dao,\none can be empty and tranquil,\nand thus merge with Dao/Way in essence.\n\nThe **Supreme Primordial** (太上):\nThe lower knows its existence.\nIn the **Supreme Primordial** of ancient times,\nthe ruler was like a standard branch,\nand the people like wild deer—such was their state.\n\nThe next stage:\nThey were cherished and praised—\nthis is binding people through *ren* (仁) and *yì* (义).\n\nThe next stage:\nThey were feared and insulted—\nthis is subduing people through wisdom and strength.\n\nThus, when trust is insufficient,\ndistrust arises.\nIf I truly trust myself,\nthen governing the world through Dao/Way is enough.\nOnly when self-trust is insufficient\ndo we then reinforce it with exhortations and rewards,\nand press it with laws and governance—\nthen the people begin to harbor distrustful hearts.\n\nAh! How precious is speech.\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nthe common folk will say, *\"It was natural.\"*\n\nIf one values naturalness and the people submit to effortless transformation,\nthen the governance of the **Great Antiquity** can be restored—\nthus it is said that *sound and color in civilizing the people*\nare but superficial.\n\n**Chapter XVIII** — *Hé Shàng* names it *\"Refined Winds.\"*\nThis chapter praises the effortless transformation of the **Great Antiquity**\nwhile warning of the daily decline of customs.\n\nWhen the **Great Dao** is abandoned,\n*ren* and *yì* emerge;\nwhen wisdom arises,\ngreat deceit follows;\nwhen the six kins are discordant,\nfilial piety and kindness appear;\nwhen the state is chaotic and confused,\nloyal ministers arise.\n\nThe grandeur of the **Great Dao**,\nthe substance of the seven virtues—\nthey lie hidden within,\nyet the people remain unaware.\nThis is what is meant by *\"pure and unblemished\"*—\nwho would then need sacrificial vessels?\n\nYet sacrificial vessels are not separate from purity and simplicity—\nthey are merely the products of emerging wisdom and deceit.\n\nWén Dìng says:\n*\"Emperor Yáo was not unfilial,\nyet he alone extolled Shùn—\nthere were no blind historians.\nThe Duke of Zhoū was not disloyal,\nyet he alone extolled Lóng Fēng and Bǐ Gān—\nthere were no tyrants like Jié and Zhòu.\"*\n\n**Chapter XIX** — *Hé Shàng* names it *\"Restoring Purity.\"*\nThis chapter extols the winds of simplicity and purity,\ndiscarding the burdens of private desires—\nits benefits are vast.\n\nThe *Yīn Shù Jīng* says:\n*\"Cutting off one source of profit,\none needs tenfold the use of force.\"*\nSo it is.\n\nSome say *\"absolute\"* (絶) is not *\"to utterly discard\"* (去絶),\nbut rather *\"to reach its utmost, beyond mortal attainment.\"*\n\nOne must utterly abandon wisdom\nbefore discarding private cleverness—\nthe lower ranks agree.\n\nTo abandon learning is to have no worries.\nTo attain Dao/Way is to forget its articulation—\neffortlessly unburdened.\n\nHow far apart are *\"yes\"* (唯) and *\"ah\"* (阿)?\n*\"Yes\"* (唯) — pronounced *wéi shuǐ*, its tone respectful and reverent.\n*\"Ah\"* (阿) — pronounced *wū hé*, its tone lofty and arrogant.\n\nHow far apart are *\"good\"* and *\"evil\"*?\nWhat one fears,\none must truly fear.\n\nIf one has not yet reached the stage of abandoning learning,\none must know that this mind is serenely effortless—\nbefore good and evil arise,\nit is the undivided original essence,\nthe most upright and virtuous.\n\nWhen one inclines toward good or evil,\nthese are movements.\nYet the body cannot help but respond—\nthus one must scrutinize the moment of sensation and response.\n\n*\"Respect\"* and *\"good\"* originate from the rectitude of principle;\n*\"arrogance\"* and *\"evil\"* sink into the private *qi* of form.\nBetween these two,\nthe distance is as thin as a hair—\nyet Heaven’s principle and human desires are divided.\n\nDesire is easily swayed—\nno one is exempt.\nThis is why one must fear it.\n\nIf one can examine it with precision,\nchoose with discernment,\nguard it firmly,\nand nurture it thoroughly—\nuntil movement is without movement,\nstillness is without stillness—\nthen even with infinite responses,\none remains serene and luminous,\npure in Heaven’s principle,\nutterly without opposition—\nwhat then of arrogance and evil?\n\nAh! Its vastness knows no end.\nIts grandeur is boundless, its shores unknown—\nfor it never leans toward one side of respect or arrogance.\n\n「The multitude bustles and rejoices,\nlike feasting on the grandest sacrificial meats,\nlike ascending to the Spring Platform.\nYet I alone stand in dread—\nits signs not yet revealed—\nlike an infant before it learns to speak.\n\n*Dread* is *white-ge* (báigé), the state of stillness.\nAs the heart and eyes traverse the world,\nexternal things flourish in their splendor,\nand one follows them moment by moment,\nunaware of their falsity.\n\nOnly the Sage of Highest Clarity sees through their delusion,\nencountering them with indifference and unmoved,\nlike an infant not yet taught to grasp,\nfor its heart clings to nothing.\n\n*Buoyant* and unrestrained—\nas though it had no place to return to.\nZao said: *\"To ride the myriad things in their course,\nwithout attachment or hindrance.\"*\n\nWhile others all have excess,\nI alone seem abandoned—\n*abandoned* is *forgotten*,\nyet it is as though I have and have not.\n\nAh! My heart is that of a foolish man—\npure and unadulterated.\n\nYu’s annotation says:\n*\"The natural Dao does not manifest,\nyet silently aligns with the Way—\nthis is called Great Wisdom.\"*\n\nThe vulgar shine brightly—\nI alone seem dim.\nThe vulgar are keenly discerning—\nI alone am *muted* and *spacious*.\n*Shining brightly* is the radiance that dazzles the eyes,\n*dim* is to not distinguish.\n*Keenly discerning* is clarity without self-display,\n*muted* (mèn), with the sound of *mo-bun* (mòbēn), is spaciousness.\n\n*Vast* and *unbounded*—\nlike the sea, *billowing* without end.\n*Billowing* (liáo), with the force of *li-you* (lìyōu), is the state of long winds swaying.\n\nThe depths hold stillness to contain all things—\nthus the perfect unity of the whole.\nChange and movement without rest—\nthus the wondrous flow of Great Function.\n\nWhile others all have their uses,\nI alone am *stubborn* and *crude*.\n*Uses* are *functions*.\n*Stubborn* (wǎn) is ignorance,\n*crude* (bǐ) is rusticity.\nAll know the use of function,\nyet none know the use of *non-function*.\n\nI alone differ from others,\nvaluing *food from the Mother*.\nWen Ding said: *\"The Dao is the Mother of all things.*\nOthers follow things and forget the Dao,\nbut the Sage abandons all things,\ntaking the Dao as his ultimate refuge—\nlike an infant seeking nourishment from its Mother.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 21** – *He Shang* names it *Empty Heart*.\nThis chapter reveals the true Dao,\ngrasping the constant nature of all things.\n\n*Flexibility* brings completeness.\nThe Sage of Highest Clarity aligns with heart and aligns with Dao—\nwhether bent or straight,\nit is only the rightness of purpose that ensures the Dao is fully realized.\n\nIf one abides in the changes of time,\nthen bending the self preserves the Dao.\nOnly by bending can one avoid clashing with things,\nkeeping the body whole within,\nand the world whole without.\n\n*Crookedness* brings straightness.\nCrookedness is what makes straightness possible—\nthe inchworm’s curl to seek its stretch.\n\n*Lowliness* brings fullness.\n*Lowliness* (wā), with the sound of *wu-guā* (wūguā), is *hollow*—\nlike the earth’s depths receiving water,\nfor humility invites benefit.\n\n*Decay* brings renewal.\nDarkness giving way to daily radiance.\n*Little* brings attainment—\nthe Dao is singular.\nTo attain the One is to attain all.\nThus, within the utmost simplicity,\nthe fullness of its essence is realized,\nits marvelous function complete in every way.\n\n*Excess* brings confusion.\nAll matters with too many paths lead to confusion.\nTherefore the Sage embraces the One\nas the model for all under Heaven.\n\nThis is to follow the Dao’s transformations with time,\nyet to hold to humility and simplicity as the core.\nThe Sage alone embraces the One\nas the eternal standard for all ages—\nfor to embrace the One is to realize the Dao in its entirety.\n\nHe does not display himself—\nthus he is luminous.\nHe does not affirm himself—\nthus he is manifest.\nHe does not boast of himself—\nthus he has merit.\nHe does not exalt himself—\nthus he endures.\n\nOnly by not contending,\ndoes he make all under Heaven unable to contend with him.\n*Display* (xiàn), with the sound of *xing-diàn* (xìngdiàn), is *to show*.\nThis teaches the scholar how to cultivate *virtue*.\n\nFor to embrace the One is to have no self—\nif he still displays himself, affirms himself, boasts of himself, or exalts himself,\nthen his self-perception has not been forgotten—\nhow then can he speak of the One?»\n\nWhen one attains the realm of *no-self*,\nthen naturally luminous and vast,\never fresh with time—\nmind and *dharma* merge, self and others both extinguished—\nwhat contention remains?\n\nThe ancients spoke of *\"curved then whole\"*—\nwas this mere idle talk?\nTruly whole, and thus returned.\n\nFor Laozi, though obscured, did not compose—\nhis words *\"curved then whole\"* and such\nwere the ancient texts.\nThis further confirms their truth,\nurging deeply.\n\nIf the scholar truly exhausts the *Way* of yielding and bending,\nthen the *Way’s* fullness\nis indeed all returned to him.\nThe *Way* is inherently human—\nthus *\"returned,\"* meaning restored to its origin.\n\nThus, his straightness and fullness are profound.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\n*Riverbank Benefit-Humility* demonstrates\nthe *virtue* of yielding compliance,\nperfecting harmony.\n\n*Xi* (希) speaks of naturalness.\nThe *Classic* says: *\"Listening yet not hearing is called xi.\"*\nThe Sage’s words arise from *xi*,\nall from their naturalness—\nthus enduring without exhaustion.\n\nDuke Wen said: *\"The virtuous do not speak yet are believed—\nthus natural.\"*\n\nHence, gusting winds do not last till morning,\nsudden rains do not last till evening.\nGusting winds are the frenzied, swift winds;\nsudden rains are the violent, abrupt rains.\nThis is the collision of *yin* and *yang*,\na sudden transformation.\n\nYet they cannot overcome the natural tranquility,\nso they cannot endure.\nFrom dawn till noon is *\"till morning,\"*\nfrom dawn till dusk is *\"till evening.\"*\nWho does this?\nHeaven and Earth.\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot endure—\nhow much less can mortals?\n\nIf one reverses the natural,\nit is not natural.\nThough arising from Heaven and Earth,\nit cannot endure—\nhow much less from mortals?\n\nYet Heaven and Earth also cannot always be natural,\nso mortals—\nhow could they escape loss?\n\nThus those who cultivate the *Way*\nmust cultivate the *Way* of naturalness,\nkeeping their hearts steadfast,\nto embody the *Way’s* workings—\nthus joyful in giving and skilled in guiding,\nwith no distinctions to make.\n\nThe *Way* aligns with the *Way*—\nthis is the path of the easy-walker.\nYet even the Sage’s innate wisdom\nstill relies on learning to perfect the *Way*.\nThus, *\"virtue does not stand alone—\nit must have companions,\"*\nand so aligns with the *Way*.\n\n*Virtue* aligns with *virtue*—\nthis is the path of the beneficial-doer.\nLearning and seeking to gain for oneself.\n\nThe lost align with the lost—\nthis is the path of the striving-doer.\nFor though one’s innate *qi* may be flawed,\none’s nature is never truly different—\nthus, align and transform with them.\n\nAlign with the *Way*, and the *Way* is gained;\nalign with *virtue*, and *virtue* is gained;\nalign with loss, and loss is gained.\nThough their inherent endowments differ,\ntheir reception must diverge.\nYet if one aligns and transforms them,\nwhen gained, the result is the same.\n\n*\"Faith insufficient, there is doubt.\"*\n\nYet when the sincerity of self-*virtue* does not reach its fullest extent,\none doubts because of their flaws,\nthus falling into the affliction of *unfaith*.\n\nIf *unfaith* arises,\neven when aligning with them,\none cannot transform them either.\n\nOnly when one deeply cultivates and attains self-*virtue*\ndoes one stand firmly in the realm of *unfaith’s absence*.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**—*River Above* names it *Emptiness-Nothingness*.\nThis chapter illustrates that the *Dao* of Nature can endure eternally,\nyet though it is most effortless to attain,\nit is difficult to guard.\nHence, though the heavens and earth are vast,\nif they lose their constancy,\nthey too cannot endure—\nhow much more so for mortals!\n\nIn mortals, their *nature* is inherently the same,\nbut their *qi* and constitution differ.\nIf one is ensnared by the private desires of form and *qi*,\nthey lose their natural *nature*,\nyet their *nature* is never truly lost.\nOnly the *First Awakened* can skillfully guide them to awareness,\nalign with their affairs to encompass them,\nand thus restore their original, natural state.\n\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"If they stand at the brink of the abyss,\nI shall also stand with them at the brink of the abyss.\"*\nTo reach the state of *flawlessness*—this is the way.\n\nThis is the *virtue* of the Sage’s great harmony,\nthe teaching of *no private agenda*,\nby which one follows *nature*’s course,\nbending and completing without omission.\n\nOnly those who end in *self-abandonment*\nare not included in this.\n\nThe *lame* do not stand,\nthe *limping* do not walk.\n*Limping*—pronounced *kuà*, same as *enterprising*.\nThe *limping* are those who straddle both extremes.\n\n*Master Wen* said:\n*\"To defy the constancy of one’s *nature* while the heart clings to partiality—\nthus, both cannot coexist.\"*\n\nThe *self-revealed* are not enlightened,\nthe *self-proclaimed* are never truly clear,\nthe *self-righteous* do not shine,\nthose who *mar their own worth* while claiming righteousness—\nwho would believe them?\n\nThe *self-praised* achieve no merit,\nthose who boast of their own labors—\nothers do not regard them as merit.\nThe *self-conceited* do not endure,\nthose who dazzle with their abilities—\nthey cannot last long.\n\nAs for the *Dao*,\nit speaks of *\"excessive nourishment and superfluous actions.\"*\nSome may detest them,\n*superfluous*—pronounced *zhuàng*, meaning flesh attached to the main body.\n*Actions*—pronounced *xíng*, as in *\"to walk.\"*\n*Detest*—with falling tone.\n\nMaster Wen said:\n*\"These are all those who compete externally while losing themselves internally.\nLike discarded surplus food—\nit only makes others detest it;\nlike parasitic growth—\nit only makes one appear grotesque.\nThus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon such things.\n*Dwell*—upper tone, meaning not to fix one’s mind upon them, as if casting them off entirely.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four** (River Above: *Kù’ēn*)\nThis chapter speaks of those who master unity within, yet do not boast outwardly.\n\nThere exists something mixed and complete,\nborn before Heaven and Earth.\n*Born*—*xījiàn* cut, meaning prior in existence.\nThe Dao is mixed and complete in its essence,\neternally existing since antiquity,\nfrom which the Two Complements arise.\n*Thing*—the Dao’s manifestation as things.\nSilent and boundless,\nit stands alone yet never alters,\ncirculates endlessly yet never falters—\nthus it may be called the Mother of all things.\n*Silent*—utterly soundless,\n*boundless*—formless and distant.\nIn its essence, it stands unmatched and unchanging,\nin its function, it circulates universally without peril—\nthis is the complete, original whole,\npossessing the wondrous power of generation and transformation.\n*Mother*—the source of all generation,\nnot reducible to any single thing,\nthus praised as *silent and boundless*;\nyet not lost in empty stillness,\nso both essence and function are spoken of—\nindependent, circulating, and inexhaustibly generative.\n\nI know not its name—\nI call it *Dao*,\nand forcefully name it *Great*.\n*Forcefully*—upper tone, for it cannot truly be named.\n*Great* is called *Passing*—\n*Passing*—to go forth, meaning it pervades all things.\n*Passing* is called *Distant*—\nit reaches everywhere without limit.\n*Distant* is called *Returning*—\nwhen pushed to its utmost, its greatness knows no boundary;\nwhen sought, its smallness knows no interior—\nit permeates all things yet never departs from its source.\nThus, the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nand the Sage is great.\nWithin the realm, there are four greats,\nand the Sage occupies one of them.\n\nThe Dao transcends Heaven and Earth’s formed existence,\nhence the chapter begins with *\"before Heaven and Earth,\"*\nyet it is never absent from within Heaven and Earth’s formed realm,\nhence it is also said: *\"Within the realm, there are four greats.\"*\nIf spoken of in terms of the Dao,\nthen Heaven, Earth, and the Sage are insufficient to describe its greatness—\nyet the Dao is not separate from these three as another thing.\nThus, when speaking of the realm,\npeople only recognize the greatness of these three,\nhence it is said so.\nIt is not meant to say the Dao is also one thing within the realm—\nscholars must not let the words obscure the meaning.\nThe phrase *\"and the Sage occupies one of them\"* means:\nMan is the heart of Heaven and Earth,\nuniting with the Dao,\nto conceal Heaven within Heaven,\nand Earth within Earth.\nAmong all things, the most refined and luminous is Man,\nand the Sage governs them.\nMan follows Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows *zìrán*.\n*Follow*—the meaning of mutual dependence.\nThus, in order:\nMan dwells within Earth,\ntaking form and receiving position;\nEarth corresponds to Heaven,\nwhile Heaven still has form;\nThe Dao permeates the Three Powers,\nits essence being *zìrán* alone.\nIf we trace their mutual dependence,\nthese three all originate from the natural Dao—\ndiverse in form, yet one in essence.\nThus, Heaven is within the Dao,\nEarth is within Heaven,\nMan is within Earth,\nMind is within Man,\nSpirit is within Mind—\nall converging in the Dao.\n\nThus, Spirit is hidden in Mind,\nMind in Form,\nForm in Earth,\nEarth in Heaven,\nHeaven in the Dao.\nMaster Wen said:\n*\"If a man were to recover his nature in a day,\nthen these three—Heaven, Earth, and Man—\nall would be fully realized by him.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five** (River Above: *Xiàngyuán*)\nThis chapter praises the Dao’s greatness and naturalness.\n\nThe heavy gives root to the light,\nthe still governs the restless.\nThus, the virtuous person walks all day\nwithout departing from his burden.\n*Heavy*—*zhíyòng* cut.\n*Light*—*qǐzhèng* cut, of few schemes.\n*Restless*—*zào*, early report cut.\n*Depart*—falling tone.\n*Burden*—*zī*,庄持 cut, a heavy cart.\nThe Sage’s Way takes stillness and weight as its foundation,\nnot to be recklessly abandoned,\nlike a cart’s burden—\nits movement must not be taken lightly.\n\nThough there are splendid sights,\nhis dwelling remains serene and detached.\n*Sights*—*guān*, ancient *luàn* cut.\n*Dwelling*—upper tone.\nSplendor belongs to things,\ntranquility belongs to oneself—\nonly by not exchanging oneself for things\ndoes one wander and observe with ease,\nunattached, self-sufficient beyond things.\n\nHow can one who rules the myriad chariots\nmake his body lighter than the world?\nLightness leads to losing one’s ministers,\nrestlessness leads to losing one’s sovereignty.\n*Chariots*—falling tone.\n*Body lighter*—as the characters.\nThe exalted ruler must not indulge private desires\nwhile neglecting the world’s weight.\nLightness leads to reckless action,\nthus losing the support of ministers.\nRestlessness disturbs the people,\nthus losing the Way of rulership.\nSome say:\n*\"Lightness causes the ruler to lose the support of ministers,\nrestlessness causes ministers to fail in their duties to the ruler.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six** (River Above: *Zhòngdé*)\nThis chapter states that only through stillness and weight\ncan one govern all things.\n\nSome say:\n*\"Taking it near to oneself,\nthe mind is the ruler,\nqi is the minister—\nlightness causes the mind to act recklessly and oppress qi,\nrestlessness causes qi to disturb and counter the mind.\nThe ruler is the master of people and things,\nthe mind is the master of the body—\nwhat must be still and weighted is non-action, yet achieving success.\"*\n\nGood conduct leaves no tracks,\n*Conduct*—*xíng*, down *Mèng* cut.\nWheels rolling leave tracks in the earth—\nwhat tracks does the Dao leave?\nGood speech leaves no flaws,\n*Flaws*—*xiá*, down *Jiā* cut, blemishes.\n*Over*—*zhé*, straight *gé* cut, meaning speech is harmonious with Heaven’s intent,\nthus no verbal errors.\nGood planning does not require calculations—\nthe Dao is one, encompassing all things.\n\n「善闭无关楗而不可开，\nThe adept at closure requires no bolts or bars yet remains unopenable—\n*Bolts*—*guān*, *its* *yǎn* cut; *bars*—*jié*, *its* *yǎn* cut, the wooden frame that blocks a door. Horizontal is called *guān*, vertical is called *jié*.\nWithout doors or walls, four ways open vast and boundless,\nYet even the boundless Heaven and Earth cannot exceed its limits—\nthis is called adept closure.\n\n善结无绳约而不可解。\nThe adept at binding needs no cords or fetters yet remains unseverable.\n\n妙本湛然，不为法缚，不求法脱，\nThe wondrous root is profound and serene—\nunbound by dharma, yet not clinging to dharma’s release,\nspacious and dense, utterly without separation—\nthis is called never to be parted for a moment.\n\n苟溺於刻意尚行，执言滞句，\nIf one is ensnared by rigid intentions and dogmatic practices,\nclutching words and fixating on phrases,\nusing the mind to measure and calculate in pursuit of the Dao,\n\n而不达方便之门，\nyet fails to enter the gate of expedient means,\nthen one is bound by doctrinal forms and cannot penetrate to the fundamental source of all dharma.\nThus, one cannot truly perceive the roots of ten thousand things.\n\n所谓善者，无为而已。\nWhat is called \"good\" is simply non-action.\n\n是以圣人常善救人，故无弃人；\nThus, the sage always adeptly rescues others—\ntherefore, there are none abandoned.\n常善救物，故无弃物。\nAlways adeptly rescuing things—\ntherefore, there are none discarded.\nThis is called inheriting clarity.\n\n夫救人於危难，特救其形耳，\nTo rescue others from peril is but to save their physical form—\n而且未必能博，\nand even this may not always succeed.\n岂足为善哉。\nHow can this be called \"good\"?\n\n惟彼方执着有为，迷其性於暗蔽之中，\nOnly those who cling to deliberate action,\nlost in their nature within the obscured darkness,\n我以兼容之量容之，以先觉之明觉之，\nI encompass them with boundless tolerance,\nand awaken them with foresighted clarity,\n使彼之天光自发，\nso that their inherent luminosity may naturally arise—\n如明灯之传袭无尽，\nlike a bright lamp passed endlessly,\n而在我者既以与人己愈多，\nand as I give more to others, I also give more to myself,\n则其明亦何限量哉。\nthus, my clarity knows no bounds.\n\n叶梦得曰：常之为言，无时而不然也。\nYe Mengde says: \"Constant\" means\nnever failing at any time.\n\n故善人，不善人之师；\nThus, the good person is the teacher of the ungood;\n不善人，善人之资。\nand the ungood person is the resource of the good.\n因其不善而教之使善，\nTo take their ungoodness and guide them toward goodness—\n乃所以为善救也。\nthis is the true way of adept rescue.\n\n则是资其不善者，以为吾施教之地矣。\nThus, those who rely on their ungoodness\nare the very ground upon which I teach.\n\n林东曰：因其不善而不为之，是可资也。\nLindong says: \"To act upon their ungoodness yet not be swayed by it—\nthis is the true resource.\n不贵其师，不爱其资，\nI do not revere their teacher,\nnor cherish their resource,\n虽智大迷，是谓要妙。\neven if their wisdom is great yet they remain lost—\nthis is called essential subtlety.\n\n夫道之要妙，非教能到，\nFor the essential subtlety of the Dao,\nno teaching can reach it.\n故至於不贵不爱之地，\nThus, when one arrives at the realm of neither reverence nor attachment,\n则知无我。\none knows the selflessness of all things.\n人虽大智而莫测，\nThough one may possess great wisdom yet remain unfathomable,\n盖能所俱忘，\nfor both subject and object are forgotten—\n是曰独化者也。\n\nThis is called the One Who Transforms Alone.\n\n右二十七章　河上名巧用。\nThis concludes the twenty-seventh chapter,\nknown by Hedong as *Skillful Application*.\n\n此章明名连双泯，教理兼忘。\nThis chapter elucidates the extinction of names and pairs,\nand the simultaneous forgetting of teachings and principles.\n\n知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪。\nTo know its *yang* (masculine),\nand hold to its *yin* (feminine)—\nthis is the model for all under Heaven.\n*Model*—*xī*, down *Sì* cut;

Even sentient beings abhor and avoid them—how much more so those who follow the Dao? Only when used to resolve crises, never as a constant, do they not dwell upon such things in their hearts.\n\nThus, the virtuous in repose honor the left, while wielding arms they honor the right.\nThe left is yang, the principle of life.\nThe right is yin, the principle of killing.\nWeapons are ominous instruments, not the tools of the virtuous. Used only when unavoidable, tranquility and composure are paramount.\n\nVictory without pride—\n*Composure* (*tian*), pronounced *Du Lǎn*, meaning *tranquility*.\nTo cherish life and abhor killing, yet hold no desire for conquest—\nthus, those who delight in killing cannot prevail in the world.\n*Delight*, pronounced *Qù*.\nOnly those who do not crave killing can fulfill the world’s aspirations.\n\nAuspicious matters favor the left; inauspicious matters favor the right.\nHence, the *Pianjiang* (vanguard general) stands left, the *Shangjiang* (commander-in-chief) stands right—\nspeaking of treating war as funeral rites.\nWhen many are slain, mourn with sorrowful tears;\nwhen victorious, observe funeral rites.\n*Treat*, rising tone. *Funeral*, level tone.\n\n*Bìxū Zǐ* says: The right is yin, the domain of death—\nthus funeral rites favor the right, an inauspicious act.\nThe *Shangjiang* holds sole authority over slaughter—\nthus he stands right, while the *Pianjiang* does not wield such power.\n\n*Huáng* says: Weapons cannot be abandoned because bandits and hostile states harm humanity.\nThe body is like a state—greed and desire harm others in the same way.\nOnly those who follow the Dao, empty and tranquil, without cravings or attachments,\nneed fear no harm from external things—\nwhether voices, colors, or other temptations.\n\n---\n**Chapter 31**—*Hé Shàng* names it **\"Laying Down Arms\"** (*Yǎnwǔ*).\nThis chapter states that weapons are ominous instruments,\nnot to be relied upon as a constant.\n\n*Wang Bì* suggests this chapter may not be by Laozi himself,\nyet these words arise from the times.\nThe Dao is ever nameless; though simple, it cannot be subdued.\nIf lords and kings could guard it, all things would submit of their own accord.\nHeaven and Earth unite, descending sweet dew—\nno command is given, yet all is balanced.\n*Command*, pronounced *Lìzhèng*, akin to *teaching and decree*.\n*Simple* (*pǔ*)—this refers to the Dao’s complete essence.\nBecause it is formless, it is called *small*.\nBecause it precedes all things, none can subdue it.\n\n*Wēn Gōng* says: When lords and kings uphold the Dao,\nthe people submit, the *qi* harmonizes, and all are transformed—\njust as the receptive *qi* unites and sweet dew descends naturally,\nspreading evenly and permeating all things.\nThis is called the *Three Powers* (*tiān, dì, rén*) converging in the Dao.\n\nOnce names are established, names are already set.\nYet one must know when to stop—\nknowing when to stop prevents disaster.\n\n*Wén Dìng* says: The undifferentiated is dispersed into instruments,\nthus rites are established based on their functions.\nYet how could one abandon the undifferentiated for names,\nor pursue the superficial while losing the fundamental?\nRather, one must know when to stop and return to one’s nature—\nthus, amid endless transformations, one remains unshaken.\nThe Dao in the world is like streams and valleys to the sea.\n*Cáo* says: The sea is the source of water;\nstreams and valleys are its branches.\nAll branches ultimately converge at the source,\nall names return to the Dao.\n\n---\n**Chapter 32**—*Hé Shàng* names it **\"Victory Through Virtue\"** (*Shèngdé*).\nThis chapter speaks of how guarding the Dao ensures constancy.\n\nTo know others is wisdom;\nto know oneself is enlightenment.\n*Discernment* (*bié*) is wisdom—knowing others.\n*Exhaustive clarity* (*bì*) is enlightenment—seeing one’s true nature.\nOnce enlightened, one does not merely know oneself\nbut can also comprehend others.\n\nThose who overcome others rely on strength;\nthose who overcome themselves are truly strong.\nThe vigor of blood and *qi* cannot be possessed—\nthus, conquering others through force is not to be prized.\nThe courage of principle and righteousness cannot be absent—\nthus, subduing oneself and returning to one’s nature\nmeans no one can bend you, and none are stronger.\n\nThe contented are rich—\nonly through self-knowledge does one always suffice,\nabundantly at ease.\nThe resolute have will—\nonly through self-mastery does one persist in the Dao without ceasing,\nand none can steal one’s resolve—\nthus, one aligns with Heaven’s vitality.\n\nThose who do not lose their place endure.\n*Place*, akin to the *Gèn* hexagram’s \"stopping in one’s place.\"\nOnly those who know the Dao and act upon it\nfind their proper place and dwell in security.\nThus, though things transform endlessly, the heart never strays—\nnever a day without self-realization—\nthis is how one endures.\n\nTo die without forgetting is longevity.\nOnly those who know themselves, strengthen themselves,\nand never lose their place truly attain longevity.\nThis is not bound by life and death’s fluctuations,\nstanding alone and unchanging—\nhow could such a state be measured by years?\n\nInitially, this does not speak of *spirit, soul, or vital essence*\nremaining untransformed, lingering in the murky void—\nhere, one must see through to clarity.\n\n*Shào Ruòyú* says: Though the form perishes, the nature does not die.\n\n---\n**Chapter 33**—*Hé Shàng* names it **\"Discriminating Virtue\"** (*Biàndé*).\nThis chapter begins with self-knowledge,\nthus wisdom is attained.\nThen, with resolute will and acceptance of one’s fate,\none exerts utmost effort to reach the proper stopping point—\nthus, one governs the body without peril.\nThis is why the *Rǔyǎo* must awaken to solitary clarity\nbefore entering the realm beyond life and death.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast—\nit cannot be confined to left or right.\n*Vast* (*fàn*), also read as *fàn*—unobstructed.\nOnly by not clinging to any single thing,\nremaining in its proper place,\npresent everywhere and never otherwise,\ndoes one encounter the source on all sides.\n\nAll things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse—\nits work done, it does not dwell on achievement.\nClothing all things yet claiming no mastery,\nthus, it is ever without desire—\nthis may be called *small*.\nAll things return to it, yet it knows no lord—\nthis may be called *great*.\n\nThe *clothing* (clothing, *yī*)—with a falling tone—\ncovers all things yet does not reveal its sovereign dominion,\nthus it remains ever still and without trace,\nthe utmost of *small*.\n\nAll things move and interact yet none can perceive its measure,\nso it expands boundlessly yet lacks form to be grasped,\nthe utmost of *great*.\n\nThis is why the Dao is *vast*—\nit may be encountered on all sides.\n\nHence, the Sage never claims greatness,\nand thus is able to fulfill it.\nIf one claims greatness, it becomes *small*—\nonly the Supreme Sage merges with the Dao,\nand thus attains greatness.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\n*River-Upper* names it *Achievement* (*Rén Dé*).\n\nThis chapter states that those who perfect the radiant virtue\nall derive it from following the Dao.\n\nTo hold the *Great Image* (*Dà Xiàng*), all under Heaven will come.\nComing yet causing no harm,\nthey are secure, tranquil, and at ease.\n\nThe *Image without image* (*wú xiàng zhī xiàng*)—\nthus it is called the *Great Image*.\nTo *hold* (*zhí*) is to embody it without contradiction.\n\nThe Dao is the mother of all things;\nthings come and attach to virtue,\nlike children returning to their mother.\n\nTo *come* (*wǎng*) is to *return* (*guī*).\nYet when the multitude returns,\nif one harbors a sense of self,\nharm will ensue.\n\nOnly the Supreme Sage empties himself to preserve sincerity,\nbenefiting yet causing no harm,\nso neither he nor others are injured,\nand his heart remains tranquil, peaceful, and at ease.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*The Sage interacts with things without harming them,\nand if he does not harm them,\nthings cannot harm him either.*\nOnly he who harms nothing\ncan truly meet others with mutual accord—\nthis is the same meaning.\n\n*Music and bait* (pleasures and inducements),\n*passing guests* (fleeting influences) may halt.\nThe Dao’s utterance is bland—\nwithout flavor to taste,\nunseen when viewed,\ninaudible when heard,\nits use never exhausted.\n\n*Music* (pleasures) and *bait* (inducements) are *Yue* (ear-pleasing).\n*Out* (utterance, *chū*)—with a falling tone.\n*Bland* (*dàn*)—read as *tú zàn*.\nIt refers to those who do not grasp the *Great Image*\nand are confined to a narrow, one-sided Dao,\nlike the loss of hearing to melodious tones,\nor the fleeting delight of cattle and horses in food.\n\nThough *passing guests* (fleeting influences) may linger for a moment,\ntheir power is ultimately finite—\nthen they will depart, leaving behind.\n\nZhuangzi metaphorically speaks of stopping at the *Qiaolu* (a humble dwelling)\nfor one night—\nthis is the same intent.\n\nYet the *Great Dao*,\nthough profound and without form, sound, or scent,\nits efficacy is boundless.\n\n*Exhausted* (*jì*)—to *finish* (*jìn*).\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Five**\n*River-Upper* names it *Virtue and Benevolence* (*Rén Dé*).\n\nThis chapter illustrates the boundless effects of embodying the Dao.\n\nTo *gather* (*xī*), one must first *expand* (*zhāng*);\nTo *weaken* (*ruò*), one must first *strengthen* (*qiáng*);\nTo *abandon* (*fèi*), one must first *flourish* (*xīng*);\nTo *take away* (*duó*), one must first *bestow* (*yǔ*).\n\nThis is called *Subtle Clarity* (*Wēi Míng*).\n\nWhen *expansion* reaches its limit, it must *gather*;\nWhen *bestowal* is excessive, it must *take away*—\nthis is the inevitable principle.\n\nWhat is called *\"must first\"* (*bì gù*)\nis like saying:\nWhen things are about to *gather*,\nthey were originally *expanded*—\nthen *gathering* follows naturally.\nThis is the principle of *ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness* (*xiāo xì yíng xū*).\n\nThough its mechanism is subtle and hidden,\nthe principle is clear and evident—\nonly those who dwell in *clarity and stillness, gentleness and weakness*\ndo not fall into its trap.\n\n*Gentleness* overcomes *rigidity*,\n*weakness* overcomes *strength*.\nOnly by residing in *gentleness and weakness*\ndoes one lack the intent to overcome,\nand the principle naturally aligns—\nthis is the teaching of *Returning to the Root* (*Shǒu Fù*).\n\nIf one is *rigid and strong*,\nit means they have already overreached—\n*decay* will inevitably follow.\n\n*A fish cannot be plucked from the depths*—\nThe state’s *sharp tools* (tools of power),\ncannot be displayed to the people.\n\nFor the one who embraces the Dao within himself\nand withdraws to conceal it in secrecy.\n\n*Sharp tools* are those that control entry and exit,\nwhich all people rely on,\nyet the ruler who holds their mechanism\nuses them to govern others.\n\nNot only should they not be displayed to the people,\nbut they cannot even be *obtained* to display to others.\nThis is what the *Yinfu* (a Daoist text) refers to as *stealing the mechanism*.\n\nThe people can be made to follow,\nbut cannot be made to know.\n\nWen Ding said:\n*The fish, as a creature, has no claws or teeth\nto overpower others.*\nYet when it rests in the depths,\neven the strongest cannot seize it—\nbut once it leaves the depths,\nthen people can capture and control it.\n\nThe Sage alone dwells in *gentleness and weakness* without satiety,\nthus he can ultimately subdue all under Heaven—\nthis is not something shared with the common people.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Six**\n*River-Upper* names it *Subtle Clarity* (*Wēi Míng*).\n\nThis chapter demonstrates that the principle of *ebbing and flowing, fullness and emptiness*\nis constant,\nwhile those who cling to *gentleness and weakness*\ndo not understand its mechanism.\n\nThe Dao acts without action,\nyet nothing remains undone.\nSilent and unmoving,\nall principles are complete,\nresponding when touched,\nleaving no matter unattended.\n\nIf sovereigns and kings could preserve this,\nall things would naturally transform.\n\nWhen transformation is complete and they wish to act,\nI would restrain them with the *Unnamed Root* (*wú míng zhī pǔ*).\n\nTo always embody the *Supreme Dao*,\nthen one need not teach—\ntransformation will occur naturally.\n\nYet time will bring change,\nlike the infant’s hair turning into knowledge—\nthen one must again restrain with *non-desire*.\n\n*Non-desire* leads to *stillness*,\nwhich is the complete embodiment of the Dao—\ntruly the *Unnamed Root*.\n\nThe *Unnamed Root* will also not desire,\n*non-desire* brings *stillness*,\nand all under Heaven will naturally align.\n\nIf one harbors a *desiring Root* (*yù pǔ*) in his heart,\nhe will lose its complete embodiment.\n\nThis is to exhaust one’s nature to reach one’s destiny,\nto be great and capable of transformation.\n\nSuch *true stillness* (*zhēn jìng*)\nis why all things under Heaven\nare naturally transformed,\neach preserving its innate nature and destiny.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven**\n*River-Upper* names it *Governance* (*Wéi Zhèng*).\n\nThis chapter reveals how embodying the Dao can transform,\nand how it also encompasses\nforgetting in *mystic enlightenment* (*Xuǎn Wù*).\n\nFrom the beginning to this point,\na total of thirty-seven chapters—\ncompleting the *Upper Part* (*Shàng Piān*).\n\n*Daoist Classic of the Way and Virtue with Annotated Commentaries*\n*Volume Two* ends.\n\n---\n**Volume Three**\n*Commentaries by Later Scholars*\n*Bo Dong Si Jing* (董思靖)\n\nThe virtue of the **Highest Dao** does not cling to virtue,\nand thus it possesses virtue.\n\n*The Commentary* says: Confucius did not dwell upon his sageliness,\nand thus he truly possessed virtue.\n\nTo embody the Dao and gain its benefits for oneself—this is virtue.\n\nWang Gu and others say:\nHe who has virtue transcends his flaws,\nwhile he who lacks virtue clings to his gains.\n\nThe virtue of the **Lower Dao** does not lose virtue,\nand thus it lacks virtue.\n\nTo cling rigidly to it, trembling in fear of losing it—\nthis is one who cannot yet transform,\nand thus falls short of the **Highest Dao**.\n\nThe **Highest Dao** acts without action,\nand yet nothing is left undone.\n*\"With\"* here means *\"to employ\"*—\nit means employing nothing in action.\nThe same applies below.\n\nThe **Highest Dao** is supreme virtue,\nand its essence lies in non-action alone.\n\nThe **Lower Dao** acts and yet employs means.\n\nThis requires thought before attainment,\nand effort before fulfillment—\nthe deeds of those who act yet have not reached perfection.\n\nSince they are still entangled in action,\nthey cannot fully embody the Supreme Dao.\nThis explains the distinction between **Highest** and **Lower Dao**.\n\n**Highest Benevolence** acts yet employs nothing.\nBenevolence is the virtue of the heart,\nthe principle of love—\nwhen spoken of specifically, it encompasses the four virtues.\n\nThis does not refer to the universal transformation of the Dao,\nand thus it falls short of the **Highest Dao** in rank.\nYet transformation is stillness—\nthough it acts, it employs nothing in action.\n\n**Highest Righteousness** acts and yet employs means.\nRighteousness is what is fitting in conduct,\nbut carries the implication of division and constraint,\nand thus ranks lower.\n\n**Highest Ritual** acts, yet none respond,\nso it forces compliance by bared arms.\nRitual is the ordered patterns of Heaven’s principles,\nthe propriety of human affairs—\nits foundation lies in loyalty and sincerity,\nbut excessive formality becomes mere ornament.\n\nIf today it is enforced, then its essence is stripped away,\nand it is imposed by force.\nWhen some refuse to comply, it resorts to bared arms,\nand its excesses become unbearable.\n\nLaozi lived in an age of extreme formalism,\nand thus speaks of it with particular urgency—\nhe wished to transform the people through the natural Way of non-action.\n\nThese three are spoken of as **\"Highest\"**\nbecause those below are unworthy of mention.\n\n*\"Bared arms\"* means rolling up one’s sleeves to bare the arms.\n*\"Rem\"* means *\"to follow\"*—\nWen Gong says: *\"Rem\"* means *\"to draw\"*—\nthe character may also be written as *\"rēng.\"*\n\nWhen the Dao is lost, only then does virtue arise;\nwhen virtue is lost, only then does humanity appear;\nwhen humanity is lost, only then does righteousness emerge;\nwhen righteousness is lost, only then does ritual take form.\n\nThe Dao is an undifferentiated whole,\nshared by Heaven, Earth, and all things.\n\nHuman nature embodies principle,\nand when this principle is realized within oneself—\nwithout reliance on the external—\nit is called *virtue*.\n\nInitially, there is no virtue separate from the Dao,\nbut once named as *virtue*,\nit is divided into ranks and distinctions,\nunlike the Dao’s all-encompassing embrace.\nThus, when virtue is not fully realized,\nthe complete body is still the Dao.\n\nIf one clings to virtue as possession,\nthen lower virtue fails to transform,\nand the Dao’s wholeness is lost—\nhence, *\"When the Dao is lost, only then does virtue arise.\"*\n\nThe *Guan Yin Zi* says:\n*\"What can be named is called virtue, not Dao.\"*\n\nWhen the name of virtue is prominent,\nthe name of the Dao fades.\nWhen the name of humanity is prominent,\nthe name of virtue fades.\nThe more one pursues, the lower one descends,\nand the more one values, the more one strays.\n\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The Dao is hidden in small achievements.\"*\nTruly so.\n\nRitual is the thinning of loyalty and sincerity,\nand the beginning of chaos.\nWhen ritual’s excesses reach their peak,\nits essence is diluted,\nand its later stages become the source of disorder.\nThis is why Confucius sought guidance from those ahead of him.\n\nPreconceived knowledge is the ornament of the Dao,\nand the origin of folly.\nThis is the work of those who wield intelligence—\nto force understanding through cleverness,\nor to guess and occasionally succeed,\nyet never truly comprehend.\nThis only obscures one’s natural clarity,\nmaking it the beginning of folly.\n\nAs *Mencius* says:\n*\"What I dislike in intelligence is its rigidity.\"*\n\nWhen obscured by superficial adornment,\none cannot preserve the purity of the Great Dao—\nwhat else could it be but folly?\n\nThus, the true gentleman\nhas lofty vision beyond the world,\nyet does not conform to its trends.\nHe dwells in substance, not in superficiality,\nin reality, not in ornament—\nand so he discards the latter for the former.\n\n*\"Dwelling\"* and *\"discarding\"* are both read with the rising tone.\nWhy not return to the original?\n\nWen Ding says:\n*\"People’s sight stops at the eyes,\ntheir hearing at the ears,\ntheir thoughts at the mind—\nthus they delight in what they grasp below\nand lose sight of what is above.\nThey favor the shallow and neglect the profound,\npursue ornament and abandon substance.\nWithout the true gentleman’s resolve,\nwho could discard the one for the other?\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Riverbank Discourse on Virtue**\nThis chapter clarifies complete virtue and encourages a return to simplicity.\n\nSomeone asked:\n*\"Do the Five Constants of morality and virtue have distinctions?\nOr are they undifferentiated?\nHow do their applications differ?\"*\n\nThe reply:\n*\"How could they be undifferentiated?\nThe Dao encompasses the whole,\nwhile virtue arises from the measure of one’s capacity within oneself.\nThe Dao is like the undifferentiated primordial *qi*,\nvirtue is like the names given to seasons and times,\nand humanity, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom\nare like the designations of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\nWhen all four are fully realized,\nit is called a year.\nWhen humanity is at its peak,\nit is spring;\nwhen ritual is at its peak,\nit is summer;\nwhen righteousness is at its peak,\nit is autumn;\nwhen wisdom is at its peak,\nit is winter—\neach attaining its true essence.\nThus, every eighteen days of the season’s soil phase\ncorresponds to this principle.\n\nThere is humanity within righteousness,\nso life contains death;\nthere is righteousness within humanity,\nso death contains life—\nas when willows wither in February\nyet wheat sprouts in August.\n\nThe same applies to the world.\n\nThe *Huang Ji Jing Shi Shu* says:\nThe Three Sovereigns governed the world through the Dao,\nthe Five Emperors through virtue,\nthe Three Kings through merit,\nand the Five Hegemons through force.\nThe Three Sovereigns shared humanity but differed in transformation,\nthe Five Emperors shared ritual but differed in teaching,\nthe Three Kings shared righteousness but differed in exhortation,\nthe Five Hegemons shared wisdom but differed in leadership.\n\nThus, the age of the Three Sovereigns was like spring,\nthe age of the Five Emperors like summer,\nthe age of the Three Kings like autumn,\nand the age of the Five Hegemons like winter.\n\nWhen Laozi met Guan Yin,\nit was at the juncture of autumn and winter—\nperhaps he sought to transform the world\nwith the steadfast Dao\nand restore it to spring.\n\nSomeone asked:\n*\"Why do their sequences differ?\"*\n\nThe reply:\n*\"Governance involves both adaptation and revolution.\nThus, the order follows what is natural,\nbut this chapter addresses the excesses of named distinctions,\nso it advocates complete revolution.\n\nAs the *Book of Transformation* says:\nWhen humanity is insufficient, righteousness supplements it—\nmetal subdues wood;\nwhen righteousness is insufficient, ritual supplements it—\nfire subdues metal;\nwhen ritual is insufficient, wisdom supplements it—\nwater subdues fire;\nwhen wisdom is insufficient, trust supplements it—\nearth subdues water.\n\nThus, dwelling in substance and profundity\nis the true essence of trust—\nthe beginning that is the end,\nand the end that is the beginning.\n\nGuo De Yuan once asked Zhu Wen Gong:\n*\"Laozi says ritual is the thinning of loyalty and sincerity,\nand the origin of chaos.\nYet Confucius also sought guidance on ritual from others.\nWhy is this?\"*\n\nWen Gong replied:\n*\"Laozi understood the complexities of ritual,\nfor he had once served as the Palace Archivist,\nand thus grasped its intricacies—\nthat is why he spoke so well with Confucius.\nBut he also said ritual could be dispensed with,\nas if the Sage’s use of it seemed burdensome,\nwhich is why he spoke thus.\nAs in the *Ritual of Music*, where it says\n*'Planning leads to action, and war arises from this,'*\nthere lies this very meaning.\n\nIn ancient times, those who attained Oneness—\nHeaven attained Oneness and became clear,\nEarth attained Oneness and became tranquil,\nthe Spirit attained Oneness and became responsive,\nthe grains attained Oneness and became abundant,\nall things attained Oneness and flourished,\nand the feudal lords attained Oneness to govern the world with integrity—\nthis is the effect of Oneness.\n\nThe One is the Dao,\nwhich has always existed—\nhence, it is called *ancient*.\n\nAll things possess it yet the Dao remains unchanged—\nthus, it is called One.\nHeaven’s clarity, Earth’s tranquility,\nthe Spirit’s responsiveness,\nthe grains’ abundance,\nall things’ flourishing,\nand the lords’ integrity—\neach fulfills its natural function\nthrough the power of the One.\"*\n\nThe Master Wen said: When speaking of affairs, if they endure without ceasing, this is what is meant by *One*.\n\nHeaven, without its clarity, would risk fracturing;\nEarth, without its tranquility, would risk erupting;\nThe Spirit, without its responsiveness, would risk fading;\nThe grains, without their abundance, would risk depletion;\nAll things, without their flourishing, would risk extinction;\nThe feudal lords, without their integrity, would risk collapse.\n*Collapse*—pronounced *jué*, meaning to topple and fall.\n\nIt is through the *One* that Heaven remains clear and fulfills its role in nurturing life,\nand through the *One* that Earth remains tranquil and fulfills its role in bearing and sustaining.\nShould there be no clarity or tranquility,\nthen there would be the possibility of cracks, fractures, tremors, or upheavals—\nthis arises from losing the *One*.\nYet the *One* has never truly been lost;\nhence, it is said *\"would risk\"*—this is merely an expression of doubt.\n\nMoreover, the *One* as a thing\nhas neither departure nor arrival—\nhow could it be lost?\nIt is only that the ebb and flow of *qi* may sometimes be excessive or deficient,\nunable to fully embody what the *One* accomplishes.\n\nThus, the *Book of Yin-Yang* states:\n*\"Heaven’s fracturing\"* is due to insufficient *yang qi* and the decline of the ruler’s virtue.\n*\"Earth’s trembling\"* is due to excess *yin qi* and the failure of the ministers’ duties.\nFor example, during the *Yuan Kang* era of the Jin Dynasty’s Emperor Hui,\nHeaven split open for several *zhang*, with a resounding crash.\nIn the second year of King You of Zhou,\nthe Three Rivers trembled, and Mount Qi collapsed—\nthese are cases of the same kind.\n\nAs for the Spirit, it is called *Spirit* because of its responsiveness,\nand its responsiveness comes from attaining the *One*.\nIf it lacks responsiveness, then its vitality is already extinguished.\n*Fading*—meaning to cease.\n\nThe grains, without abundance, cannot receive and respond—\nthey too would reach their limits,\nhence, it is said they would *deplete*.\nAll things rely on the *One* to flourish;\nlose it, and they perish.\nThe feudal lords, without integrity, lose the Dao and cannot secure their own stability—\ntheir states cannot be preserved.\n\nAlthough the *One* is not absent,\nit is merely that external malevolent *qi* or intrusive influences may sometimes obstruct its proper manifestation.\n\nFirst mentioning Heaven—\nthe greatest of forms.\nFinally mentioning the ruler—\nthe sovereign over Heaven, Earth, and all things.\nOnly the ruler can preserve the *One*\nto set the standard for the world,\nand thus Heaven and Earth take their proper places while all things flourish.\n\nThe Sage of Azure Emptiness said:\n*\"Gather and return to admonish the rulers and nobles.\"*\nThis is correct.\n\nThus, nobility finds its foundation in humility,\nand height finds its base in lowliness.\nHence, the feudal lords refer to themselves as *\"lonely, bereaved, and lacking\"*—\nis this not their way of grounding themselves in humility?\nIs it not so?\n*Lacking*—meaning *\"beautiful\"* in this context.\n\nThe perverse sounds—ah, yes.\n\nWén Dìng said:\n*\"What, then, is this* One *truly?*\nTo gaze upon it, no form is seen;\nto grasp it, nothing is held—\nthe most subtle of all beneath Heaven.\nThis is what is called *lowly* and *base*.\n\nWhen feudal lords call themselves *lonely, bereaved, and lacking*,\nthey speak of attaining the *One* as their foundation.\nThus, they seek neither hasty praise nor disdainful censure,\nnor do they desire the gleaming brilliance of jade,\nnor the rough hardness of stone.\n*Lü*—the sound of *lù*, its likeness to jade.\n*Luo*—the character should read *gě*, the sound of *luò*, its likeness to stone.\n*Shù*—entered tone, swiftness.\nThose who cannot shepherd humility,\nwho take *lowliness* as their foundation,\nyet crave swift fame and exalted status—\nthis is *hasty praise*.\nSo then, exaggerated flattery gathers violently,\nwhile baseless slander follows in its wake—\nthis is *disdainful censure*.\nYet still, they do not wish to be like jade,\nnoble yet unable to be base,\nnor like stone,\nbase yet unable to be noble.\nFor only he who does not lean upon any single thing\ncannot be defamed or praised, exalted or debased—\nwho else but he who has attained the *One* could achieve this?\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\n*Riverbank [School] Canon of Names: The Origin*\n\nThis chapter extols the *One*’s function as supremely great,\nyet ultimately warns against clinging to it.\n\nThe *Way* moves through inversion,\nand finds its use in weakness.\nTo invert stillness is how the *Way* moves,\nwhile its body, though weak, manifests true power.\nIt speaks of motion without mentioning stillness,\nof weakness without mentioning strength—\na mutual parallelism revealing intent,\nand clarifying the meaning of *body* and *use*.\n\nIt is said that if one establishes stillness to ground the *body*,\nthen the *use* of motion may unfold.\nTo speak of the *body*’s tranquil emptiness—this is weakness,\nyet its reach is vast and ungoverned—this is strength.\nThough *body* and *use*, motion and stillness flow without interruption,\nmotion must still root in stillness,\nand *use* must still spring from *body*—\nthus the primal transformation’s craft lies hidden in winter,\nonly to flourish in spring.\nThe *Way* of learning:\nto refine essence and penetrate spirit—\nthis is the foundation for governance and application.\n\nAll things beneath Heaven arise from *having*,\nyet *having* arises from *non-being*.\nThis is further proof of the principle of generation.\n\nIt is said that all things emerge through *qi*-transformation,\nthus they arise from *having*.\nYet tracing their origin to their source—\nthe *Way* itself.\nThe *Way* initially has no form, sound, scent, or tangible presence—\nthus it is said to arise from *non-being*.\n\n**Chapter Forty**\n*Riverbank [School] Canon of Names: The Elimination of Use*\n\nThis chapter clarifies how to exalt the *body* to achieve *use*.\n\nSome say the *Way* takes stillness as its essence,\nso motion becomes contrary to the *Way*.\nIf so, then the *Way* is confined solely to stillness—\na grave misunderstanding.\nTruly, motion and stillness are the workings of *qi*,\nwhile the *Way* governs and transcends motion and stillness,\nunbound by them.\n\nSome say inversion aligns with propriety—\nthis is the *Way*’s motion and responsiveness to change,\na display of *adaptive expedience*;\nwhile weakness as self-preservation—\nthis is the *Way*’s constant application,\na display of *substantial reality*.\nYet when *having* arises from *non-being*,\nexpedience and reality merge indistinguishably.\n\nThe superior man hears the *Way* and diligently practices it;\nthe man of middle rank hears the *Way* and holds it as if present, as if absent;\nthe inferior man hears the *Way* and laughs in derision—\nto not laugh would be to fail in recognizing the *Way*.\nThe *Way* is not form or sound,\nnot visible or audible—\nonly the superior man, endowed with pure stillness,\nwhose insight transcends, accepts it without doubt,\nas empty when confronted with emptiness,\nand never strays in haste.\n\nThe middle man’s perception wavers between high and low,\nthus he oscillates between belief and doubt.\nThe inferior man lacks wisdom to comprehend,\nand faith to uphold—\nas Zhuangzi said, *\"Lofty speech does not settle in the common heart,\"*\nso he laughs in derision.\n\nThus, the *Establishment of Speech* says:\n*\"The ancients who formulated doctrine declared:*\nThe *Way*, though clear, seems obscured—\nonly by illuminating the subtle essence,\nabandoning form and discarding intellect,\ndoes one contain light without radiance.\n\nThe *Way*, though level, seems uneven—\n*level*—plainness;\n*lu*—Lu’s cutting, like uneven silk.\nHigh and low merge harmoniously,\nboundless with all things,\nyet to the vulgar eye,\nit appears as if marked with defects,\nunfit for use.\n\nAdvancing the *Way* seems like retreat—\nto practice the *Way* is daily diminishment,\ndiminishing again and again,\nuntil reaching *non-action*—\nthus it seems like retreat.\n\nGreat *virtue* seems like a valley—\ngreat *virtue* does not cling to *virtue*,\nlike a valley’s emptiness.\n\nGreat brightness seems like shame—\nthose who forget form and color\ncan embrace filth.\n\nBroad *virtue* seems insufficient—\nif *virtue* is broad yet constrained by measure,\nthen it is not truly broad.\nOnly when *virtue* is boundlessly broad,\nyet does not consider itself sufficient,\ncan it truly be broad.\n\nEstablishing *virtue* seems like laziness—\nto cultivate in secret, act in obscurity,\nto build *virtue* without self-aggrandizement.\n*The Treatise on Mysterious Threads* says:\n*'Hidden merit preserves its wholeness.'*\nThis is the same meaning.\n\nTrue substance seems corrupt—\n\n---\n\nTrue substance, though pure and unadorned, seems corrupt*—\n*\"Semü\"* (渝), pronounced *Yangzhu*, means \"to change.\"\nTrue substance (质真) is pristine simplicity.\nOnly when both form and substance are complete\ndoes one not cling to one alone,\nthus adapting to things while inwardly preserving its truth,\noutwardly appearing corrupt.\n\nThe Great Square has no corners—\nA corner is where angles meet the earth.\nThe Great Square has no boundaries to exhaust,\nthus it has no corners.\n\nGreat vessels take long to mature—\nWhat is accumulated over time\nwhen unleashed must be vast,\nso great vessels are never hastened to completion.\n\nGreat sound is rare in tone,\ngreat form is shapeless—\nthe Way is hidden, nameless.\nThe *Classics* say: *\"Listening yet not hearing is called rare\"* (希),\nthus great sound is rare in tone.\nThe *Classics* say: *\"The formless form\"* (无象之象),\nthus great form is shapeless.\nThough these transcend sight and hearing,\nyet in the unseen they are known,\nand in the voiceless there is harmony—\nhow could they not be manifest in perception?\n\nThese are the twelve ways\nthe Way is sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed,\nembodied in things,\nwhile the Way’s fullness remains hidden in the nameless.\n\nOnly the Way is both generous and complete—\n*\"Acquit\"* (贷) means to bestow,\n*\"Complete\"* (成) means things rely on it to succeed.\n---\n**Forty-first Chapter** (*Riverbank* on *Same and Different*)\nThis chapter speaks of the Way’s fullness,\ndifficult for the middle and lower ranks to know.\nFor the Way is formless and nameless,\nthus cannot be attained by deliberate action.\nOnly by sinking deep and immersing oneself\ndoes the Way itself take residence—\nthis is how the Way generously bestows upon all things,\ncompleting its boundless, selfless wholeness.\n\nThus the ancient scholars cultivated for themselves\nyet ultimately achieved success for all—\nthis is embodying the Way.\n\nThe Way gives birth to One,\nOne generates Two,\nTwo generates Three,\nThree generates all things.\nMaster Zhu Wen (朱文公) said:\n*The Way is the *Taiji* of the *Yijing*,\nOne is the oddness of Yang,\nTwo is the pairing of Yin,\nThree is the accumulation of odd and paired.\nWhen it says \"Two generates Three,\"\nit means Two and One make Three.\nWhen it says \"Three generates all things,\"\nit means the union of odd and paired gives birth to all things.\nIf one simply takes One as the *Taiji*,\nthen it cannot be said that the Way generates One—\nthis aligns with Liezi’s claim that the *Yijing* transforms into One.\nThe so-called \"One\" is merely the beginning of transformation,\nnot the abstract number One.\n\nAll things carry Yin on their backs and embrace Yang,\ntheir vital breath harmonized.\nFor living beings,\ntheir backs face rearward—Yin’s stillness—\nwhile mouths, noses, ears, and eyes face forward—Yang’s activity,\nthus \"carry Yin and embrace Yang.\"\nAs for plants,\nthey turn toward warmth and away from cold,\nwhile vital breath circulates between.\nIn broader terms,\nthe spirit is Yang, substance is Yin—\nthe spirit moves within as \"embracing,\"\nsubstance manifests externally as \"carrying.\"\nQi moves as dynamic Yang and stasis Yin,\nbalanced by central harmony,\nfilling form and substance,\nthe mechanism upon which the spirit rides.\nMaster Wen (温公) said:\nAll things take Yin and Yang as their essence,\nand central harmony as their function.\nMaster Wenjian (文简) said:\nWhen Yin and Yang qi are imbalanced,\nor when they intermingle and harmonize,\nthis is the exchange of Two to form Three,\nthe pervasion of Three to form all things.\n\nWhat people detest—\nthe lonely, the orphaned, the childless—\nthe king and duke hold as virtues.\nThus things may be diminished yet benefit,\nor benefited yet diminished.\n*\"Evil\"* (恶), pronounced *wù*—\nMaster Wen said:\n*\"Fullness invites loss, humility invites gain.\"*\nThis is to avoid extremes and approach central harmony.\n\nWhat people teach,\nI also teach with my *Yi*.\nThe tyrannical meet no good end—\nI will take them as my teaching fathers.\n*\"Strong\"* (强), pronounced *qiáng*.\nIf one knows the principle of diminishing and benefiting thus,\nthen all teaching should follow my *Kun* and harmonious *Yi*—\nknowing the tyrannical reach their extreme\nyet still meet no good end.\nThis is especially so—\nthus I say, *\"I will take them as my teaching fathers.\"*\n*\"Father\"* (父) is the root.\nThough teaching is the master’s way,\nmasters are honored yet distant,\nwhile fathers are honored and intimate—\nthus there is no hidden meaning.\nAs the *Yijing* says:\n*\"Without a teacher or guardian,\nit is as if facing one’s parents.\"*\nThis is the same intent.\nNow, speaking specifically of *\"father\"*\nemphasizes the severity of teaching.\n---\n**Forty-second Chapter** (*Riverbank* on *Dao’s Transformation*)\nThis chapter speaks of the Way embodied in Yin and Yang,\ngiving birth to all things,\nall relying on central harmony for function.\n\nThe softest in the world\novercomes the hardest in the world—\nno gap exists in the unbroken,\nthus one knows the benefits of *non-action*.\n*\"Interval\"* (间), pronounced *jiàn*.\nOnly the Way is formless, thus *\"the softest.\"*\nOnly things have substance, thus *\"the hardest.\"*\n*\"Galloping\"* (驰骋) means to transform and employ.\nThe Way’s marvelous transformation\nis to agitate the substantial with the formless.\n\nThe Way’s essence is nonexistent,\nyet it generates all forms—\nTai Mountain, autumnal hair—\nthey rely on it to take shape.\nThus when it enters things,\ninitially there is no separation.\nThe Way’s essence encompasses all,\nneither existence nor nonexistence\nare confined within—\nmysteriously seamless, no gaps exist.\nThis is the Way within things,\nthings within the Way—\nall without gaps.\n\nIf one embodies this,\nnature and essence harmonize,\nboundlessly effortless,\nbenefits endless.\n\nMaster Wéndìng (文定) said:\nOnly the sage can practice *non-action*,\nthus employing all strength,\nentering and exiting all existence.\nSilent teaching, benefits of *non-action*—\nfew in the world attain this.\n\n*\"Rare\"* (希), meaning *\"scarce.\"*\nMaster Wáng Fǔsì (王辅嗣) said:\nThe softest cannot be bent,\nnothing cannot be exhausted.\nExtending this reasoning,\none knows *non-action* benefits things—\nwho can surpass this?\n---\n**Forty-third Chapter** (*Riverbank* on *Universal Application*)\nThis chapter praises the benefits of emptiness, softness, and *non-action*.\n\n---\n\n**Forty-fourth Chapter** (*Riverbank* on *Establishing Precepts*)\nWhat is closer: name or body?\nWhat is more abundant: body or wealth?\nThe body is the vessel of the spirit—\nhow could it not be close?\nThe name is a guest of reality—\nhow could it be revered?\n\nMoreover, the body is singular,\nwhile external things are boundless.\nIf one abandons the body for the sake of name,\nenslaving the singular to seek the abundant—\nfoolishness knows no greater extreme.\n\nFor when a person expands the Dao,\nthe body becomes the Dao’s foundation.\nMaster Wéndìng said:\nIf one forgets the self,\nthe body itself is not possessed—\nhow much more so name and wealth?\n\nGain or loss—\nwhich is the greater affliction?\nMaster Wēngōng said:\nTo gain name and wealth while losing the body,\nor to gain the body while losing name and wealth—\nwhich is the greater affliction?\n\nMaster Wéndìng said:\nNot to gain is to suffer loss,\nbut once gained, loss is already present—\nwhat further affliction can there be?\n\nThus, excessive love brings great expenditure;\nto hurl a **Hísì** pearl at a thousand-**rèn** high bird,\nboth are instances of excessive love’s delusion.\n\nExcessive hoarding brings great loss.\nNo hoarding means nothing to lose.\n**Kāiyuán** annotated:\nExcessive love of name exhausts the spirit—\nis this not great expenditure?\nExcessive hoarding of wealth burdens the body—\nis this not great loss?\n\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,\nknowing restraint brings no peril—\nthus one can endure long.\n\nOnly by discerning the distinction between inner and outer\ndoes one know restraint and sufficiency,\nand escape the calamity of gain and loss—\ntherefore one can abide in the constancy of life and death,\nand what peril or disgrace remains?\nThis is why one can endure long.\nThe **Han**’s two **còu** commentaries once expounded upon these words.\n\n---\n\n**Forty-fifth Chapter** (*Riverbank* on *Abundant Virtue*)\nThis chapter speaks of embodying the Dao’s completeness\nand thus becoming the standard for all under heaven.\n\nSome say:\nIf one is complete yet not as if deficient,\nfull yet not as if void,\nstraight yet not as if bent,\nclever yet not as if clumsy,\neloquent yet not as if tongue-tied—\nthis is merely the agitation that cannot be tranquil,\nthe tranquility that cannot be agitated.\n\nAgitation can conquer cold but not heat;\ntranquility can conquer heat but not cold—\nboth are constrained by one-sidedness.\nYet only the serene and tranquil\ntranscends the definitions of complete/deficient,\neloquent/tongue-tied—\nand thus nothing remains unconquered.\nThis is why it becomes the standard for all under heaven\nand fulfills its great purpose.\n\nWhen the Dao prevails under heaven,\nwarhorses are driven back to manure the fields;\nWhen the Dao does not prevail under heaven,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\n「却，与部同，除去也。\n*This is the same as \"除\" (to remove or eliminate).*\n\n粪，治田畴也。\n*Manure, which nourishes the fields.*\n\n戎马者，备战之马也。\n*Warhorses are those kept ready for battle.*\n\n郊者，二国相交之境也。\n*The suburbs are the borderlands where two states meet.*\n\n以内言之，心君泰然，\n*Speaking inwardly, when the heart-mind (心君) is serene and at ease,*\n\n则却返气马以培粪其本根，\n*it drives back the restless qi-warhorses (气马) to manure and nourish the roots of its foundation.*\n\n反是则意马驰於外境矣。\n*But if it is otherwise, the mind-warhorses (意马) gallop unrestrained into external distractions.*\n\n罪莫大於可欲，\n*No crime is greater than the pursuit of what can be desired,*\n\n祸莫大於不知足，\n*No calamity is greater than the ignorance of contentment,*\n\n咎莫大於欲得。\n*No blame is greater than the greed to acquire.*\n\n究其根本，原於纵欲。\n*Examining their roots, they stem from indulging desires.*\n\n文定曰：匹夫有一於身，患必及之。\n*Wéndìng says: If even a common man harbors such things within himself, misfortune will surely follow him.*\n\n侯王而为是，必戎马之所自起。\n*If a lord or king indulges in them, warhorses will inevitably arise from his own domain.*\n\n故知足之足，常足矣。\n*Thus, the contentment of contentment is everlasting contentment.*\n\n黄茂村曰：一性之内，无欠无余。\n*Huáng Màocūn says: Within the singular nature (一性), there is neither lack nor excess.*\n\n人能安之，无适不足。\n*If one can settle upon it, there is no place where it is not sufficient.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 46**\n*River Upper (河上) names it \"Moderation in Desire (俭欲).\"*\n*This chapter warns against the harm of avaricious pursuit and values contentment as a constant.*\n\n不出户，知天下；\n*Without stepping beyond one's door, one knows all under heaven;*\n\n不窥牖，见天道。\n*without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven and earth.*\n\n天地万物同出於道，\n*Heaven, earth, and all things arise from the same Dao,*\n\n反身而诚，万物皆备。\n*returning inwardly and being genuine (诚), one possesses all things.*\n\n温公曰：得其宗本故也。\n*Wēngōng says: This is because one has attained its fundamental source (宗本).*\n\n其出弥远，其知弥少。\n*The farther one goes from it, the less one knows.*\n\n温公曰：迷本逐末也。\n*Wēngōng says: This is because one becomes lost in the roots (本) and pursues the extremities (末).*\n\n是以圣人不行而知，不见而名，不为而成。\n*Therefore, the sage does not act yet knows, does not see yet names, does not do yet accomplishes.*\n\n盖清明在躬，无为而已。\n*For clarity and serenity reside within oneself, and that is all there is to doing (无为).*\n\n温公曰：至理不易也。\n*Wēngōng says: This is the unchanging ultimate truth (至理).*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 47**\n*River Upper (河上) names it \"Discerning the Distant (鉴远).\"*\n*This chapter states that true understanding can transcend the limits of perception and hearing, hence the sage’s ability to transform without action.*\n\n为学日益，为道日损。\n*In the pursuit of learning, one gains daily; in the pursuit of the Dao, one diminishes daily.*\n\n损之又损，以至於无为，\n*Diminish again and again, until one reaches the state of non-action (无为),*\n\n无为而无不为矣。\n*then one can do without doing, and nothing remains undone.*\n\n开元注云：因益以积功，忘功而体道。\n*Kāiyuán’s annotation says: One accumulates merit through learning (因益), then forgets merit and embodies the Dao (体道).*\n\n故取天下常以无事，\n*Thus, to govern all under heaven, one must rely on non-interference (无事),*\n\n及其有事，不足以取天下。\n*but when one must intervene, it is insufficient to govern all under heaven.*\n\n取者，取而化之也，\n*The act of taking means to take and transform (化),*\n\n盖克已复礼而天下归仁之意。\n*for it is the intention of subduing oneself and returning to propriety (复礼), so that all under heaven may find virtue (归仁).*\n\n黄茂村曰：无所不知，而后可以言学，\n*Huáng Màocūn says: Only when one knows nothing that can be known (无所不知), can one speak of learning (学),*\n\n故学欲日益。\n*hence learning must be daily increased (日益).*\n\n益者已化，然后可以言道，\n*What is gained must already be transformed (已化), then one can speak of the Dao (道),*\n\n故道欲日损。\n*hence the Dao must be daily diminished (日损).*\n\n然益者可以进，\n*However, what is gained can be advanced (进),*\n\n损者不可强损，\n*but what is diminished cannot be forcibly reduced (强损),*\n\n而未能兼忘其损，未为损也。\n*and until one can simultaneously forget what is diminished, it is not yet true diminishing.*\n\n直须瞥地脱落，\n*Only when one suddenly abandons all attachments (瞥地脱落),*\n\n前后际断，\n*and severs the past and future (际断),*\n\n乃至无为之地，\n*reaching the state of non-action (无为),*\n\n故能无所不为，而应用不穷，\n*then one can do without doing (无所不为), and its applications are boundless (应用不穷),*\n\n施於天下，绰绰然矣。\n*acting upon all under heaven with effortless grace (绰绰然).*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 48**\n*River Upper (河上) names it \"Forgetting Knowledge (忘知).\"*\n*This chapter speaks of the virtue of emptying knowledge to attain boundless Dao.*\n\n圣人无常心，\n*The sage has no fixed mind (常心),*\n\n以百姓心为心。\n*but takes the hearts of the common people (百姓心) as his own.*\n\n惟圣人无我，\n*Only the sage is without self (无我),*\n\n故其心不滞於一，\n*thus his mind is not constrained by one thing,*\n\n而物来顺应矣。\n*and things come and respond in accordance.*\n\n善者吾善之，不善者吾亦善之，\n*To the virtuous, I am virtuous; to the non-virtuous, I am also virtuous,*\n\n德善矣。\n*thus my virtue is ever-virtuous.*\n\n信者吾信之，不信者吾亦信之，\n*To the trustworthy, I trust them; to the untrustworthy, I trust them also,*\n\n德信矣。\n*thus my virtue is ever-trustworthy.*\n\n御注云：舜之於象，所以善信者至矣。\n*The Imperial annotation says: As Shun (舜) treated the Ox (象), his virtue of being virtuous and trustworthy was supreme.*\n\n人之有生，同具此理。\n*All who are born share this same principle.*\n\n圣人於人，莫不皆以善信遇之，\n*The sage, in dealing with people, meets all with virtue and trust,*\n\n此圣人之德量也。\n*this is the measure of the sage’s virtue.*\n\n盖善不善、信不信在彼，\n*For virtue and non-virtue, trust and non-trust lie in others,*\n\n而吾之善信未尝渝，\n*yet my own virtue and trust never waver (未尝渝),*\n\n此圣德之善信矣。\n*this is the sage’s virtue of being ever-virtuous and ever-trustworthy.*\n\n苟善善信信而绝其不善不信者，\n*If one were to be virtuous toward the virtuous and trustworthy toward the trustworthy while severing the non-virtuous and untrustworthy,*\n\n则岂所谓常善救而不弃哉。\n*then would it not be contrary to the saying that the sage always rescues the virtuous and does not abandon them?*\n\n圣人之在天下，惵惵为天下浑其心。\n*The sage, in his presence under heaven, is diligently blending (浑) the hearts of all.*\n\n百姓皆注其耳目，\n*All the common people focus their ears and eyes upon him,*\n\n圣人皆孩之。\n*and the sage treats them all as infants (孩).*\n\n惵，图协切，忧勤貌。\n*\"惵\" (diligently), pronounced *túxié*, means anxious and industrious.*\n\n为，去声。\n*\"为\" here is pronounced with the departing tone (去声).*\n\n浑，与混同，胡本切。\n*\"浑\" (blending), the same as \"混\" (mingling), is pronounced *húběn*.*\n\n天下之善恶信伪，皆未知所定，\n*As for the virtue and non-virtue, trust and deceit of all under heaven, they are all yet undetermined,*\n\n圣人则惵惵然为天下浑心，\n*yet the sage diligently blends (浑心) their hearts,*\n\n盖欲融化其异而混合其同，\n*for he seeks to dissolve their differences and merge their likenesses,*\n\n故无善恶，无信伪，\n*thus there is neither virtue nor non-virtue, neither trust nor deceit,*\n\n皆一以待之。\n*but he treats them all with a singular response.*\n\n彼方注其耳巨，以观圣人之予夺，\n*They focus their ears and eyes to observe whether the sage gives or withholds,*\n\n吾皆以婴孩遇之，\n*and I meet them all as infants (婴孩),*\n\n若保赤子，\n*like cherishing a newborn babe,*\n\n此圣人之诚心也，\n*this is the sincerity of the sage’s heart,*\n\n则彼亦将释然而自化矣。\n*and thus they will also relax and transform of their own accord.*\n\n皆孩之意，谓不生分别也。\n*The meaning of \"treat them all as infants\" is that no distinctions are made.*\n\n---\n\nThe response to *\"why is it so?\"* lies in the depth of its **generative vitality (生生)**—\nthis is the answer’s phrasing.\n\nIt means that though one seeks to thicken life’s abundance, they cannot forget the self,\nand thus are driven by delusion into the realm of death.\n\nFor those drowned in the pursuit of life must inevitably meet death as its counterpart,\nwhile those who dwell beyond life and death—where no duality exists—\nremain oblivious, hence the *Classic* says:\n*\"Only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\"*\n\nSome say delusive thoughts proliferate endlessly—\nthis too is the extreme of **generative vitality (生生)**—\nand it is also acceptable.\n\nIf one can cultivate stillness to nourish **pure clarity (虚明)**,\nthen movement never departs from stillness,\nand movement and stillness are both forgotten—\nthis is the conduct of those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**.\n\nAs **Wen Ding** says:\n*\"The followers of life and death, each occupying three parts of ten,\ndo they not amount to nine parts of life and death,\nwhile the **Dao of neither life nor death** stands alone?\"*\n\nNeither life nor death is what the *Yijing* calls **\"serene and unmoving.\"**\nLaozi speaks of the nine but omits the one,\nleaving it to the seeker to realize,\nand thus entrusts the subtlety of **non-thinking, non-action (无思无为)**.\n\nIt is said that those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**\nwalk on land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,\nenter battlefields without bearing armor.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger no place to strike with its claws,\nthe blade no place to find its edge.\n\n*Why is this?*\nBecause there is no realm of death.\n*\"Rhinoceros\"* sounds similar.\nThe *Shan Hai Jing* says:\n*\"The rhinoceros emerges from the southern banks of the Xiang River,\nwith a blackish hue.\"*\nThe *Er Ya* says:\n*\"Its form resembles a wild ox, yet it has but one horn.\"*\nThis is the language of modesty—\none does not dare speak of oneself.\n\nWhen the **returning flow is whole and unified (反流全一)**,\nwhen the gathered thoughts dissolve into **non-being (归无)**,\nthis is the conduct of those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**—\nas **Guan Yin** said: *\"Forgetting vitality and transcending life.\"*\n\nThus, even the *one* is not established,\nand so their **heavenly defense (天守)** remains intact,\ntheir **spirit (神)** unassailable,\nand nothing can enter them of its own accord.\nThus numbers cannot constrain them,\ncalamities cannot reach them,\nand even the realm of life is absent—\nhow could there be a realm of death?\n\nHence it is said: *\"The Perfect One has no self,\nand aligns with the Dao in unity.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty**\nNamed *\"Noble Life\"* by **He Shang**\n\nThis chapter clarifies that those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**\ntake **non-action (无为)** as their ultimate principle,\nthus able to evade calamities and transcend life and death.\n\nYet interpretations vary:\n**He Shang Gong**, **Han Fei**, **Bi Xu Zi**, **Ye Mengde**, and **Lin Dong**\nall take the **four limbs and nine orifices** as thirteen,\nwith movement and stillness belonging to life and death.\nThe ignorant harm themselves through reckless action,\nand movement aligns with evil, leading to the realm of death.\n\nIf so, then the followers of death and the realm of death’s movement\nare indistinguishable—\nwhat more can be said of mere form?\n\n**Du Guangcheng** takes the **ten evils and three actions** as thirteen,\nand there are also those who speak of **seven emotions and six desires**.\n\n**Li Wenchou** says:\n*\"The kidneys are **Kan (坎)**, the gate of life.\nThe heart is **Li (离)**, the door of death.\"*\nEach completes a cycle of twelve branches,\nwaning and renewing—\nthis makes thirteen,\nyet it omits the thirteen of the realm of death’s movement.\n\nThe **Kaiyuan Commentary**, **Sun Deng**, **Sima**, **Shao**, **Wang**, and **Cao**\nall say:\n*\"Among ten people, three belong to each category—\nroughly, those who preserve life through gentleness occupy three of ten,\nthose who hasten death through rigidity occupy three of ten,\nand those who, though loving life, inevitably trend toward death also occupy three of ten.\"*\n\n**Cao** says:\n*\"Those who cultivate longevity are followers of life,\nthose who cultivate quiescence are followers of death,\nand those who indulge in desires and reckless action\nall trend toward the realm of death.\"*\n\n**Shu Zhao Shi** further takes the **five-phase life-death numerology** as thirteen,\nusing the following method:\n*Jia-Ji-Zi-Wu* nine, *Yi-Geng-Chou-Wei* eight,\n*Heng-Xin-Yin-Shen* seven, *Ding-Wen-Mao-You* six,\n*Si-Hai* alone stands at four—\nthis sums to thirteen.\nFor example: water is born in *Shen* (seven), dies in *Mao* (six),\ntotaling thirteen.\nThis can be extended similarly—\nthus the *Classic* should say *\"the thirteen followers of life and death\"* instead.\n\n**Huang Ri** says:\n*\"Water’s complete number is six,\nfire’s complete number is seven—\ntogether, thirteen.\"*\nThough many recent commentaries adopt this,\nwho can say such hasty compilation must be so?\nMoreover, why single out two of the five phases,\nand why discard the life-generating numbers while taking only the complete numbers?\nWhat is the meaning of this?\n\nThere are also those who say:\n*\"From the kidneys’ water rising into the heart,\nthis is the birth-and-death cycle.\"*\nThey even cite **Zhang Pingzhu’s** poem:\n*\"Thirteen wrapped in yin, six and seven in yang\"*\nas proof.\n\nSo-called **life-nurturing (摄生)** is thus taking **Kan’s substance**\nto punctuate **Li’s void**—\nuntil, in the absence of death’s realm,\none transforms into the **Great Receptive (乾)**.\n\nTheir theory seems plausible yet strays from the *Classic’s* intent.\n\n**Wen Ding** says:\n*\"Those who use things to extract essence for self-nourishment\nare followers of life.\nThose who indulge in sounds, colors, odors, and flavors\nharm themselves—these are followers of death.\"*\nHaving thus divided the paths of life and death,\nI also know deceit yet fail to know stillness,\nknow speech yet fail to know silence,\nknow thought yet fail to know forgetting—\nand thus rush toward exhaustion.\nThis is what is called the **realm of death’s movement**.\n\nYet **Qing Yuan Zi’s** view is similar—\nbut the followers of death and the realm of death’s movement\nare indistinct.\nThis is why I alone clarify that **qi’s extension and contraction**\nare the followers of life and death,\nwhile **entering into use** is the realm of death’s movement.\n\nFor the **Dao of Immortality** values life,\nand thus cherishes the **yang qi of generation**—\nhow much more so the **Heavenly Dao**?\n\nThe **Dao of Ghosts** values termination,\nand thus clings to the **yin qi of decay**—\ndeath on earth.\n\nThe **Human Dao** values the **heart-mind (#1)**,\nand thus can both live and die—\nfor **qi in use** is moderate and balanced—\nhow much more so for humanity?\n\nAs for the **one of neither life nor death**,\nit is not numbered yet numbers flow through it,\nnot used yet use is accomplished—\nthis is the **embodiment of the Dao (尸乎道)**.\n\nThis is how it circulates beyond the three,\nyet is not confined by them.\n\nThe *Classic of the Dao* speaks of the three uses and one non-use—\njust as the three (Heaven, Earth, humanity) die in their own ways,\nwhile the one (Dao) transcends them all.\n\nThus, the interplay of **Elemental Changes** (元亨利贞) is called the **harmonious number**—\nbetween **Virtue (贞)** and **Primordial (元)**, there lies the **extreme of being and non-being**,\nand thus it is **numberless**.\n\nNumberless, it abides in the **kernel of the Dao**—\nthe ancients rightly saw **Kang Jie** as grasping **Laozi’s intent**.\n\nThe Dao **gives birth** to all things,\n**Virtue (德)** nurtures them,\n**Form (物)** manifests them,\n**Momentum (#2)** completes them—\nthus all things cannot but **revere the Dao** and **honor Virtue**.\n\nThe Dao’s reverence, Virtue’s nobility—\nnone can bestow them, yet they abide **naturally and eternally**.\n\nThe Dao is the **Mother of all things**,\nwhile Virtue is the Dao **embodied within us**.\n\nIn Heaven and Earth, it is **Heaven and Earth’s Virtue**;\nin the Sage, it is the **Sage’s Virtue**.\n\nThe Dao is the **origin of perpetual generation**,\nwhile Virtue **tends to the multitude without arrogance**.\n\nWithout Virtue, all things cannot fulfill their **destiny**—\nhence it is called **nurturing**.\n\n**Form** is but the **manifestation of Dao and Virtue**,\nwhile **Momentum (#2)** is the **interdependent principle** by which all things arise.\n\nThus, how could one fail to **venerate the root**?\nHence all revere the Dao and honor Virtue.\n\nTo receive one’s mandate from **Heaven** makes one the **Son of Heaven**,\nto receive it from the **Son of Heaven** makes one a **feudal lord**—\nwhere there is a mandate received, the one who grants it can **debase the other**.\nYet the Dao precedes all things in **ordaining their fates**—\nwho then could **confer rank upon it**?\n\nOnly **bestowal and deprivation** belong to none but itself,\nthus it abides **naturally and eternally**, and so is **revered and noble**.\n\nThe Dao **gives birth, nurtures, lengthens, matures, completes, ripens, nourishes, and shelters**.\nIt **generates without possession**, **acts without reliance**, **lengthens without domination**—\nthis is called **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\n*Lengthen* (長) is pronounced with a rising tone.\n\nThese eight are the **primordial functions of the Great Dao**,\nand **non-possession, non-reliance, non-domination** all stem from **selflessness**—\nthis is the **ultimate of Virtue**, profound and distant, hence **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\nThe meanings of the eight:\n**Generates** (生) is to **provide the beginning**,\n**Nurtures** (畜) is to **encompass fully**,\n**Lengthens** (長) is to **fulfill their form**,\n**Matures** (育) is to **refine their substance**,\n**Completes** (成) is to **assist their function**,\n**Ripens** (熟) is to **fulfill their time**,\n**Nourishes** (养) is to **preserve their harmony**,\n**Shelters** (覆) is to **guard against harm**.\n\nThough it begins with **Virtue nurturing**, all ultimately return to the **Dao**—\nfor nothing is outside the Dao.\n\nThough it starts with the **Dao**, it ends with **Mysterious Virtue**—\nfor without **ultimate Virtue**, the **Great Dao** would not solidify.\nIn truth, they are one.\n\n---\n**Chapter 51: *He Shang* on Nurturing Virtue**\n\nThis chapter elucidates the **wondrous root** and the **responsive generation** of all things,\nclarifying why all things **revere the Dao and honor Virtue**,\nthen praises the **functions of generation and nurturing**,\nand finally extols the **Virtue of forgetting merit**.\n\n**Heaven and Earth** have a beginning,\nand thus are called the **Mother of all things**.\n\nHaving obtained the **Mother**, one knows her **children**;\nhaving known the **children**, one must **return to guard the Mother**—\nthen one’s life will never perish.\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed, the Dao **eternally stood**,\nyet all things **draw from this beginning to be born**—\nthus it is called **Mother**.\n\nOnce the **origin is obtained**, the **Mother is known**,\nand thus the **form is established**.\n\nMoreover, one must discern that the Dao **never ceases to be present within all things**—\nfor all that **draws from the Dao to be born** are its **children**.\nThus, by **turning back to examine the children**, one’s understanding is boundless.\n\nHaving known the **children**, one must not **lose the root for the branches**,\nhence the admonition to **return and guard the Mother**.\n\nIf humanity **abides in effortless spontaneity**,\nand remains **pure without ceasing**,\nthen all things and all affairs will **each find their place**—\nthere is no other method, nor any intention to **guard** it.\n\n**Responding to things** is **transformation**,\n**Within oneself** is **the numinous**—\nsuch is all there is.\n\nThe **substance of the Dao** is **indistinctly unified**,\nand thus is the **single source** from which all differences arise—\nhence, by obtaining the **Mother**, one knows the **children**.\n\nThe **function of the Dao** is **boundless**,\nand thus the **single source** gives rise to all differences—\nhence, by knowing the **children**, one must **return and guard the Mother**.\n\nThus, one **unifies beginning and end, essence and manifestation**,\nand **returns to the origin while completing the cycle**—\nthen **life and death bring no confusion**,\nhence it is said: **\"One’s life will never perish.\"**\n\n**Seal your joy (兑)**, **close your gates**—\nthen your whole life will be **unlabored**.\n**Open your joy**, **pursue your affairs**—\nthen your whole life will be **unsaved**.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says: **\"Joy (兑) is delight.\"**\nWhen the **heart-mind** indulges in **pleasure and attachment**, it is **defiled**.\n\n**Gates** are the **portals of the senses**.\nTo **seal** and **close** is to instruct the learner in **guarding the Mother**—\nthat is, to **restrain speech**, **moderate diet**, **quiet emotions**, **preserve the spirit-qi**,\nto **view and listen with propriety**, to **move and rest in harmony**—\nthese are all ways to **nourish the form and cultivate Virtue**,\nand thus one’s life will **flourish without toil**.\n\nIf one does the opposite—\nabandoning the **inner** while **pursuing external delight**—\nthen one’s life will be **endlessly exhausted**, yet **never saved**.\n\n**Seeing what is small** is called **clarity**,\n**holding to gentleness** is called **strength**.\n\n**Using its light**, yet **returning to its clarity**—\nwithout **leaving behind calamity**—\nthis is called **inheriting constancy**.\n\n*遗 (遗)* is pronounced as *yí* (with the *yì* rhyme), meaning **to leave behind**.\n\nOnly the **Dao is formless**—\nit cannot be **seen with the eyes**, hence it is **small**;\nit cannot be **obtained by force**, hence it is **gentle**.\n\nTo **perceive it precisely** without **being obscured by things** is **clarity**;\nto **hold to it steadfastly** without **being taken by things** is **strength**.\n\nThe scholar, **concentrating the mind** and **deliberating deeply**,\n**sets it down and savors it**—\nthen the **nurturing function** is achieved.\n\nMoreover, **seeing** and **holding** are the **practices of cultivation**,\nwhile **clarity** and **strength** are the **manifest effects**.\n\n**Clarity** is the **substance**,\n**Light** is the **function**—\nsaying that the **still-stored substance** is established,\nthen the **active perception** must necessarily follow,\njust as the **light of clarity** illuminates things—\nthe **substance remains unharmed**, while the **function is boundless**.\n\nYet one must also **harmonize the light without dazzling**,\n**conceal the wisdom in ignorance**,\nthen **retreat into obscurity**—\nand thus **calamities cannot reach**.\n\nThis is called **properly transmitting the eternal Dao**.\n\n「Thus, the **virtue/power** grows ever more profound, the mind becomes ever more humble.\nWhen one reaches this state, there is no lingering calamity to fear—\nthis is the **language of the cultivator**.\n\n**Chapter 52**—*He Shang* names it **\"Returning to the Origin, Reverting to the Root\"**.\nThis chapter elucidates the **Dao/Way of returning to the source and embracing the root**.\nSome say that the **origin** is **qi**—\nfor all mortals are born from **qi**, thus **qi** is the **mother**,\nwhile the **spirit** abides within **qi**, hence the **child**.\nWhen **mother** and **child** are in harmony, the **spirit** is tranquil and the **qi** is focused—\nthis too is the **initial mechanism for entering the Dao**.\n\nIf one were to say, *\"I possess knowledge and walk the Great Dao,\"*\nonly **deeds** would be worthy of fear.\nThe Great Dao is vast and unobstructed,\nwith neither origin nor end—\nit cannot be grasped by **intellect** nor discerned by **perception**,\nfor it is without contrivance or deliberate action.\nNow, if one were to say, *\"I possess knowledge and walk the Great Dao,\"*\nthis mind has already begun to **lean upon** and **cling to** something—\nthus, only such **deliberate actions** are truly worthy of fear.\n\nFor the previous chapter exhorted one to **guard the mother** in practice,\nthis chapter now warns against the **harm of contrivance**.\nThe Great Dao is most **plain and simple**,\nyet mortals prefer **shortcuts**.\n*\"Good\"* (read with falling tone)—\nThe *Ding Guan Jing* says:\n*\"To seek the Dao against the Dao,\nto resent the Dao yet lack compassion for it.\"*\nIndeed, preferring **shortcuts** means one will never reach the **principle**.\nThe **palace** is **exhausted** by **excessive adornment**,\nand the **heart** is **overwrought** by **excessive scheming**—\nthis is **internal depletion**.\nIf speaking of the **body**, then the **palace** is the **three fields**—\nthe **storehouse** is where **vital essence and qi** dwell,\nsuch as the **stomach** being the **Great Granary**.\nTo **don fine attire** and **wear sharp blades**,\nto **overindulge in food** while **wealth overflows**,\nis called **plundering and boasting**—\nthis is **not the Dao**!\n*\"Overindulge\"* means **excess**.\nAll these are **failures to cultivate internally** while **ostentatiously displaying externally**—\nthis is **teaching plunder**,\nhow could it be the **practice of the Great Dao**?\nThe **Wen Gong** says:\n*\"To wear beauty without propriety,\nto gorge on food without satiety—\nthus it is called **plundering and boasting**.\"*\nWhy does such **boasting** arise?\nIs it not because one **desires to practice the Dao** yet **further digresses into political scheming**?\n\n**Chapter 53**—*He Shang* names it **\"Further Validation\"**.\nThis chapter states that **knowledge alone is insufficient to illuminate the Dao**,\npreferring **shortcuts is insufficient to walk the Dao**,\nand that **unverified is mistaken for verified**,\n**unobtained is mistaken for obtained**—\nall these are **not the Dao**.\n\n*\"The well-established will not be uprooted,\nthe well-embraced will not be cast off,\nand descendants continue in **sacrifice** without ceasing.\"*\nThe Dao **encompasses** the heavens and earth,\n**permeates** the ancient and the present,\n**embraces** all above and below without being uprooted,\n**circulates** through all transformations without being cast off—\nwhen **yin** and **yang** alternate, the **new** arises from the **old**,\njust as descendants **inherit** without end.\nThe cultivator must first **establish the central** to **ground their foundation**,\nthen **rootedness** will be **unshakable**;\nembrace **oneness** to **focus their vigilance**,\nthen **attachment** will be **unbreakable**.\nWhen **virtue/power** flourishes and **benefits others**,\nthe **later awakened** will **revere it**—\nuntil its **source is deep and its current long**,\npassed down through generations,\nevermore **intimate** with time.\n\nThe **Wen Gong** says:\n*\"The **unrooted** is **deep-rooted and firmly established**, **unshakable**.\nThe **uncast off** is **the people’s hearts in submission**, **unsubverted**.\nThe **unceasing** is **long-lasting prosperity**.\"*\nCultivate it **within oneself**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **true**;\ncultivate it **within the family**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **abundant**;\ncultivate it **within the village**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **enduring**;\ncultivate it **within the state**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **prosperous**;\ncultivate it **throughout the world**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **universal**.\n**True** means **unfeigned**;\n**abundant** means **effortlessly ample**;\n**enduring** means **nothing is beyond its reach**;\n**prosperous** means **nothing is lacking**;\n**universal** means **nothing is excluded**.\nFor the Dao’s **truth** lies in **self-cultivation**,\nits **overflow** in **governing others**—\nyet cultivating it **within oneself** is the **principle**.\nExtending it to **family, state, and world**,\nit remains **no different in essence**.\nThe **Wen Gong** says:\n*\"All follow the **root** to govern the **branches**,\nfrom the **near** to the **far**.\"*\n\nThus, one **observes the body** through the **body**,\nthe **family** through the **family**,\nthe **village** through the **village**,\nthe **state** through the **state**,\nthe **world** through the **world**.\nHow do I know the **world** is thus?\nBecause of this.\nThe **method of observation** is **not distant**—\nwhy seek it elsewhere?\nThough **things differ in outward division**,\nthey share **one root**—\nto observe them thus, none will fail to align.\nThis meaning should be **silently grasped beyond words**.\n\nThe *Kai Yuan* commentary says:\n*\"By the **method of self-cultivation**,\none observes the **true nature of the body**—\nits **origin** is **pure and cool**;\nonce **seen**, all **perceptions** are **discarded**;\nknowing **emptiness**, even **emptiness** is **discarded**—\nabandoning **both extremes**, one **suddenly harmonizes** with the **Middle Dao**,\nthus **truly attuned**.\"*\n\n**Chapter 54**—*He Shang* names it **\"Cultivation Through Observation\"**.\nThis chapter elucidates **cultivating oneself and extending to all things**.\nThe broader the **cultivation**, the farther its **reach**.\n**Knowledge** and **rectification of things** are **no different** in essence.\n\nThe **depth of virtue/power** is **like that of an infant**.\n**Nurturing** the **most profound virtue/power**,\nas if one were a **babe**.\n**Venomous insects** do not **sting**,\n**ferocious beasts** do not **seize**,\n**raptorial birds** do not **clutch**.\n*\"Sting\"* (pronounced *shì*)—\n*\"Seize\"* (pronounced *jù*)—\n*\"Clutch\"* (pronounced *bó*).\nA **hollow vessel** striking another,\nthough **violent**, does not **rage**.\n**The perfect human**—\n**harmony with all things**.\n\n*Bi Xu* says:\n*\"Venomous insects* (like wasps) **sting** with their tail ends;\n*ferocious beasts* (like tigers and leopards) **seize** with their claws;\n*raptorial birds* (like eagles and hawks) **clutch** with their talons.\n**Bones weak, sinews soft**, yet **grasp firm**—\n**unaware of sexual union** yet **naturally aroused**,\nthis is the **apex of essence**.\"\n\n*\"Aroused\"* (pronounced *zuò*)—\nThe *Shuo Wen* says:\n*\"The infant is **yin**.\"*\n\n*Wen Ding* says:\n*\"To hold without **grasping**,\nto act without **desire**—\nthis is **essence in excess**, not the **mind**.\nTo **wail all day** yet **throat unhoarse**,\n**harmony** is **perfect**.\n*\"Wail\"* (pronounced *hào*)—**to cry**.\n*\"Throat\"* (pronounced *yì*)—\n*\"Hoarse\"* (pronounced *gě*)—\n**to lose one’s voice**.\n*Wen Ding* says:\n*\"When the **mind moves**, the **qi** is **injured**;\nwhen the **qi** is **injured**, **weeping** becomes **rasping**—\nthus, one knows that **stillness of the mind** brings **qi harmony**.\"*\n\n**\"Knowing harmony is constancy.**\n*Cao* says:\n*\"Harmony is the natural principle of life.*\nTo know harmony is to be pure, still, and one—\nto traverse ten thousand changes without loss.\"\n\n**\"Knowing constancy is clarity.**\nFrom clarity comes vision—\nthis is the Dao of enduring, natural constancy.\nOnly by abiding in constancy does one’s Dao grow ever clearer,\nthus knowing constancy brings no greater enlightenment.\"\n\n**\"Excessive cultivation is ominous.**\n*Yi Sheng* says: *\"All contrived action is excessive cultivation.\"*\nOminous—this is *yao* (portent).\n*Da Zhen Zi* says:\n*\"Ominous is not the natural way.\"*\n*Wen Ding* says:\n*\"Life cannot be artificially enhanced—\nyet if one seeks to enhance it,\nthis is not the right path,\na reckless fabrication.\nThe Classic says:\n*'Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings calamity.'*\nWhen the mind forces *qi*, this is coercion.\nIf the mind moves, it cannot focus *qi* to gather softness—\nthis is the beginning of coercion,\nthe loss of the infant’s pure heart.\nWhen things flourish, they age—\nthis is called *not the Dao*,\nand *not the Dao* brings early decay.\"\n*Yi* (pronounced *yǐ*), to cease.\n\nAll forced cultivation of *qi* abandons the natural way,\nthus only hastening decay and aging.\nIf one knows it does not align with the Dao,\none should cease it early.\n\n---\n**Chapter LVI**\n*River Above* names it *Xuan Fu* (Mysterious Symbol).\nThis chapter begins with the infant’s essence—\nthe pure, undivided, chaotic unity of nature’s foundation,\nso nothing can penetrate it.\nThus, even grasping or wailing arises from nature alone.\nAt its end, it warns against even a thread of contrived thought,\nfor this loses the natural way.\n\n*Huang Mao Cai* says:\n*\"The ancient text had no *yì* (throat) character,\nand *hào* (wail) without *gě* (hoarse) is *Zhuangzi*’s style—\nlater scholars added it.\"*\n\nThe wise do not speak;\nthose who speak do not know.\nThe true Dao transcends speech and silence—\nonly those who embody it know it.\n\n**Block the senses’ excess,\nclose the gates of perception,\ndull the sharp edges,\nunravel the tangled,\nharmonize the radiance,\nblend with the dust—\nthis is called *Xuan Tong* (Mysterious Unity).**\n*(See Chapters IV and LVII.)*\nFor within and without nurture each other,\nsilently merging with the Dao without distinction from others.\n\n**It cannot be approached or distanced,\ncannot be used for gain or harm,\ncannot be exalted or debased—\nthus it is the most noble in the world.**\nThis describes those of *virtue/power*.\n\nOnly because it is all-encompassing yet not partial,\ngrasping yet roundly responsive,\nmeeting the boundless without fixating—\nit does not dwell in any single realm.\nHow could the mind’s schemes ever reach it?\nThus the Master sighed like the *Yu Long* (Jade Dragon).\n\n---\n**Chapter LVII**\n*River Above* names it *Xuan De* (Mysterious Virtue/Power).\nThis chapter speaks of the enlightened one—\nforgetting speech, free of attachment,\nthus inner and outer are both refined,\nmysteriously unified and vast—\nhence its nobility.\n\n**Govern with rectitude, act with strategy in war,\nand take the world without strife.**\nHow do I know this is so?\n\n**Chapter LVII**\n\n*River Above* says: The ancient sages were gentle yet far-reaching, capable yet near—\nthey had no desire for war,\nonly resorting to military campaigns when absolutely necessary.\nThus, governing the state with rectitude is the proper way,\nwhile employing force in war is the expedient measure.\n\nThe world is a divine instrument—\nit cannot be coerced.\nTherefore, those who embody the Dao simply remain effortlessly tranquil,\nthough they have no conscious intention of taking the world,\nyet the world naturally submits to them.\n\nThe more prohibitions a ruler imposes,\nthe poorer the people grow.\nThe more weapons a people wield,\nthe more corrupt the state becomes.\nThe more cunning they are,\nthe more strange objects proliferate.\nThe more laws are promulgated,\nthe more thieves and robbers arise.\n\nIf one abandons the principle of *non-action* (無為) in governance\nand instead multiplies prohibitions,\nthe people will lose their bearings and resort to mechanical schemes.\n\nIf the ruler is likened to the world,\nthen the mind is the sovereign,\nand *qi* (氣) is the people.\nBut if one clings to petty techniques,\nfixates on private intelligence,\ndrowns in endless stratagems,\nand indulges the six vices (六賊),\nthen *non-action* (無為) becomes impossible.\n\n*River Above* says: When rulers multiply prohibitions,\nthe common people’s grievances cannot reach above—\nthen the people will grow impoverished and helpless.\n\nWeapons are the tools of *power politics* (權謀).\nThe sovereign who practices *non-action* (無為)\nsimply ensures the people have no knowledge or desires.\nIf the sovereign and the people deceive each other through intelligence,\nthe people will grow cunning,\nand the sovereign will grow increasingly bewildered and corrupt.\n\nStrange objects are marvels and oddities.\nIf people abandon their fundamental occupations\nand pursue frivolous enterprises,\nthen useless and extraordinary things will emerge.\nIf rulers fear the people’s deceit\nand thus issue excessive laws to suppress it,\nthe people will be at a loss,\nand thieves and robbers will multiply daily.\n\nThus the sage says:\n*I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love tranquility, yet the people align with propriety;\nI remain without affairs, yet the people grow wealthy;\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.*\nThis is the natural response,\nand the success of *non-action*.\n\n**Right, the fifty-seventh chapter.**\n*River Above* names it *Pure Wind* (淳風).\nThis chapter elucidates the governance of *non-action*.\n\nIts governance is *mysterious and expansive* (闷闷),\nits people are *pure and harmonious* (淳淳).\n*Mysterious* (闷), pronounced *wǎn*, rhymes with *mò* (莫) and *bèn* (奔),\nsymbolizing the broad, yielding, and effortless nature of governance.\n\nThose of *virtue/power* (德),\nwhen it comes to matters of right and wrong,\nare always clearly distinct,\nyet their capacity is vast and boundless.\nThus, governing with *virtue/power*,\nthey do not scrutinize the common people with rigid laws.\nThough it may appear to the vulgar eye\nas if they do nothing,\nthe people are truly moved by the natural transformation,\nmaking this the ultimate governance of purity and harmony.\n\nIts governance is rigid and scrutinizing (察察),\nits people are deficient and chaotic (缺缺).\nOnly those who do not know\nto cultivate *virtue/power* as the foundation of governance,\nand instead rely solely on cleverness,\nseek to impose order on the people through laws and punishments.\nBut the people cannot be suddenly made uniform—\nif one insists on forcing uniformity,\nthen injury will inevitably occur,\nand thus their chaos.\n\nThis is what is called:\n*harm arises from kindness, disaster lurks in fortune.*\n*Disaster, oh disaster, is fortune’s companion;\nfortune, oh fortune, is disaster’s shadow.*\nWho knows their limits?\nFor it is said that disaster and fortune intertwine,\nand none can know where they cease or begin.\n\nIs there no distinction between right and wrong?\nIf so, then is there no fixed principle of right?\nRight itself becomes expedient,\ngoodness itself becomes *heretical* (祆).\nThe people’s confusion is long-standing.\n\nOnly the worldly are bewildered by the shallow clarity of rigid laws,\nand do not comprehend the completeness of the true Dao.\nThey cannot rest in the ultimate right,\nand instead take expedient measures as the standard of right;\nthey cannot follow the ultimate goodness,\nand instead regard heresy as goodness.\n\nWhen their responses diverge,\nthey do not know to reflect inward\non the source of their own confusion,\nbut instead revere the external manifestations of right and wrong.\nThis is a profound and long-standing deviation from the true Dao.\n\nIt is also like governance—\nunable to contain the people with broad, mysterious virtue,\nand instead insisting on rigid scrutiny as the measure of goodness and right,\nthey fail to realize that this will lead to the very chaos they seek to avoid.\nThus, the following passage urges the cultivation of the sage’s virtue.\n\nThe *Kai Yuan* (開元) annotation says:\n*When beings cling to delusion,*\n*the truly right is seen as cunning deceit,*\n*and the truly good is seen as heretical strangeness.*\nThus, disaster and fortune intertwine,\nas if there were no true rightness at all.\n\nHence the sage is square yet not rigid,\nonly acting squarely while embodying rounded virtue—\nthus no trace of rigid division remains.\nFrugal yet not harmful,\nclear yet accommodating—\nthus no injury occurs.\nStraightforward yet not domineering,\nfor great straightness seems like bending—\nthus no forceful imposition.\nLuminous yet not dazzling,\nreturning to its natural brightness.\n\n---\n\nThus, these four [qualities] are all the governance of **frugality** (*jǐn*).\nIndeed, the sage alone practices tranquility, simplicity, and non-action,\nwhile employing the methods of **square** (*fāng*), **ease** (*kāng*), **straightness** (*zhí*), and **luminosity** (*guāng*).\nThey naturally arise within him, yet others remain unaware—\nallowing all under heaven to follow their own nature and destiny,\nwithout falling into one-sided extremes.\nThus, there is no fault of **rigid division** (*割截*), **harmful injury** (*刿*), **forceful imposition** (*肆*), or **dazzling excess** (*耀*).\nWhere then do disaster and fortune arise?\n\n**Chapter 58** – *Hé Shàng* names it **Harmonious Transformation** (*Shùn Huà*).\nThis passage seeks to guide the people away from cleverness and artifice,\nfollowing the Dao of heaven to dispel their narrow, deceptive perceptions.\n\nThe *Zhēn* (*真*) and *Dào* (*道*) *Zhēn Jīng* (*真经*) *Jí Jiě* (*集解*) states:\n**#1** *The noble Dao of humanity is the heart* – Originally read as *\"The noble Dao of humanity is in the heart\"* (*人道者心*), corrected according to the *Shí Wàn Běn* (*十万本*) to *\"The noble Dao of humanity is the heart\"* (*人道贵心*).\n**#2** *Those who cling to appearances* – Originally read as *\"Those who cling to things\"* (*执者*), corrected according to the *Shí Wàn Běn* (*十万本*) to *\"Those who cling to appearances\"* (*势者*).\n\n---\n\nIn governing humanity and serving heaven,\nnothing surpasses **frugality** (*jǐn*).\n**Frugality** (*jǐn*)—when applied to music and sound—\nrefrains from excessive display, embodying restraint, concealment, and steadfastness.\n\nThose who study the Dao long enough\nwill broaden their heart and fill their **qi** (*氣*),\nthus attaining the fullness of **heavenly virtue** (*天德*).\nThis is the **\"ultimate sincerity\"** (*至诚*) that exhausts one’s own nature,\nand only then can one exhaust the nature of others—\nreaching even to the point of harmonizing with heaven and earth.\n\nIndeed, the principle of humanity and heaven is one,\nwith no separation at all.\n\n*Mèng Shì* (*孟氏*) says:\n*\"To preserve the heart and nurture one’s nature*\n*is the way to serve heaven.\"*\n\nOnly through **frugality** (*jǐn*) can one return early,\nand returning early is called **repeatedly accumulating virtue** (*重积德*).\n**Repeatedly** (*重*)—pronounced with a falling tone—means *again*.\n*Wén Gōng* (*文公*) says:\n*\"Returning early\"* refers to the ability to correct faults without delay.\n**Repeatedly accumulating virtue** means that one has already amassed some virtue,\nand through **frugality** (*jǐn*), nurtures it further—\nthis is another layer of accumulation, like those who cultivate early\nand, having not yet suffered loss, promptly correct themselves.\n\nRepeatedly accumulating virtue,\none can overcome all obstacles.\nOvercoming all obstacles,\none’s capacity knows no bounds.\n\nOnly **virtue** (*德*) can conquer things,\nso when one’s personal virtue is fully realized,\nits measure and extent are boundless.\n\nBoundless virtue can establish a state.\nA state founded upon such virtue can endure.\n\nThe people’s attachment to virtue\nis like a child’s longing for its mother.\n\nIndeed, the foundation of a state lies in the self,\nand if the self possesses its Dao,\nthen it can endure forever.\nIf one takes the self as the state,\nthen the mother is the root of **yin** (*雌*), and\nthe nature of life and death,\nthough subject to birth and death,\ncannot be altered—\nhence the saying, *\"endure forever.\"*\n\nThis is called the **Dao of deep-rooted stability and long-lasting vision** (*长生久视之道*).\n**Gǔi** (*柢*)—pronounced *Dīng Jì* (*丁计*)—\n*Yù Zhù* (*御注*) says:\n*\"With heaven and earth as its constant, it can achieve long life;\nwith the sun and moon sharing its radiance, it can endure forever.\"*\n\n*Wén Dìng* (*文定*) says:\n*\"Using **frugality** (*jǐn*) to govern the people, one can establish a state;\nusing **frugality** (*jǐn*) to serve heaven, one attains deep-rooted stability.\"*\n\nThe sages of antiquity preserved their nature and destiny,\nnot expending their inner essence on external affairs,\nthus their roots were deep and their foundations firm—\nunassailable by force.\nThough long life and enduring vision were possible,\nthey were not the ultimate aim.\n\nIn governing humanity and serving heaven,\nthough there are distinctions between inner and outer,\nnothing surpasses **frugality** (*jǐn*).\n\n*Chéng Yī Chuān* (*程伊川*) says:\n*\"The method of cultivation that prolongs one’s years,\nthe method of governance that invokes heaven’s blessing for a state’s longevity,\nand the way common folk ascend to sagehood—\nall these are the same.\nWhen one reaches this point,\nthese effects naturally follow.\"*\n\n**Chapter 59** – *Hé Shàng* names it **Abiding by the Dao** (*Shǒu Dào*).\nThis passage clarifies the use of **frugality** (*jǐn*).\nGoverning the people brings prolonged state fortune,\nserving heaven brings enduring life.\n\nTo govern a great state,\nit is like boiling a small fish—\n**boiling** (*烹*), pronounced *Pú Gēng* (*普庚*), means *cooking*.\n**Fish** (*鲜*), pronounced *Xiān* (*仙*), refers to *fish*.\nThis means it cannot be overdone.\n\nThose who rule under the Dao\nhave no need for supernatural ghosts.\nNot that their ghosts are not supernatural,\nbut that their supernatural power does not harm people.\nNot that their supernatural power does not harm people,\nbut that the sage does not harm the people.\n\nThus, the two do not harm each other,\nand **virtue** (*德*) flows back in harmony.\n\n**Abiding** (*莅*), pronounced *Lì Zhì* (*力至*), means *to preside over*.\nAll responses to stimuli originate from within—\nthus the sage practices non-action,\nand the people find contentment in their natural state.\nExternally, they seek nothing;\ninternally, they fear nothing.\nThen **yin** and **yang** (*阴阳*) harmonize,\nand all things find their proper order.\nHence, ghosts too have no need to exert their supernatural influence.\n\nIt is not that their ghosts lack supernatural power,\nbut that their supernatural power does not harm people—\nbecause the sage does not harm the people.\nThus, ghosts and spirits all respond to his **virtue** (*德*) and transformation.\nThe two sides harmonize and delight in each other,\nand all virtues converge—\nthis is the governance of **ultimate virtue** (*至德*).\n\n*Liè Zǐ* (*列子*)’s discussion of sage governance\nextends even to the point where *\"all things lack blemish or disease,\nand ghosts lack any supernatural resonance\"*—\nthis is the same meaning.\n\n*Wén Gōng* (*文公*) says:\n*\"If the kingly Dao is cultivated and made clear,\nthen these unrighteous **qi** (*氣*) will all be consumed and refined.\"*\n\n**Chapter 60** – *Hé Shàng* names it **Abiding in Position** (*Jū Wèi*).\nThis passage clarifies that using the Dao leads to **virtue** (*德*) returning in harmony.\n\nA great state is the **lowest flow** (*下流*) of the world.\nLike the great rivers and seas,\nwhich must lie beneath all other streams.\n\n*Wén Dìng* (*文定*) says:\n*\"The world’s convergence upon a great state*\n*is like all waters flowing downward.\"*\n\nThe world’s **intercourse** (*交*) is the world’s **yin** (*牝*).\n**Yin** (*牝*), pronounced *Pí Rěn* (*婢忍*), is the *female* or *mother* of livestock;\n**yang** (*牡*), pronounced *Mǒu* (*某*), is the *male* or *father* of livestock.\n**Yin** (*静*) always conquers **yang** (*牡*) through stillness,\nand stillness is the lowest.\n\nThus, when a great state abides below a small state,\nit takes the small state;\nwhen a small state abides below a great state,\nit takes the great state.\nHence, sometimes it abides below to take,\nsometimes it abides below and is taken.\n\n**Abiding below** (*下*)—when referring to a great state taking a small state—\nis pronounced *Xiá* (*暇*), meaning *from above to below*.\n**Abiding below** (*下*)—when referring to a small state being taken by a great state—\nis pronounced as in the character, with an ascending tone,\nas it originates from the lower.\n\n**Intercourse** (*交*) means *interaction and convergence*.\n**Yin** (*牝*) embodies the **virtue** (*德*) of *stillness, gentleness, and yielding*.\n**Yang** (*牡*) embodies the attributes of *vigorousness, strength, and elevation*.\nStillness can contain movement,\ngentleness can overcome strength—\nthis applies to all things.\nThus, stillness and yielding are the constant way of victory,\nand this is why they are the world’s convergence—\nthe meaning of *abiding in yin* (*守雌*) as the world’s *stream* (*溪*).\n\n**Taking** (*以取*) means that a great state,\nthrough its ability to abide below,\nultimately takes the small state and encompasses it.\n\n**Taking** (*而取者*) means that when a small state abides below,\nit will be cherished and received by the great state.\nIn the end, the people of the great state will even take pleasure in returning to it—\nas when King Wen of Zhou excelled in honoring the aged,\nand the people of Shao came flocking to him.\n\n**Ye Mengde** said:\n*\"Taking\"* means to obtain what one desires.\n\n**Huang** said:\nWhen a great state abides below toward a small state, it is like Tang serving Ge.\nWhen a small state abides below toward a great state, it is like Goujian serving Wu.\nThe great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others,\nwhile the small state seeks only to serve and submit.\nBoth achieve what they desire,\nso the great should take the lead in abiding below.\nTheir reason for abiding below is merely to nurture and serve others.\nIt is not a calculated move for gain,\nso if both fulfill their natural inclinations,\nthe great should be able to abide below,\nallowing the small to return of its own accord.\n\nAfter the *Great* (*大有*) in the *Yijing*,\nit must be followed by *humility* (*谦*)—\nfor this is how one preserves the great.\n\nThis chapter elucidates how, through virtue, one abides below,\nand how people converge and return in response.\n\n**Qingyuanzi** said:\nThe body is the model of a state.\nWhen the body is empty, all things come;\nwhen the heart is without, harmonious *qi* returns.\nThis is what is meant by *abiding in yin* (*守雌*) and *embracing oneness* (*抱一*)—\nthat is, *yang* descending to refine *yin*,\ntransforming into pure *yang*,\nthe subtlety of *wuwei*.\n\nThis is another meaning.\n\n**Dao** is the essence of all things.\n*奥* (*Ào*), pronounced *yú-dào* (於到切).\nThe *Shuowen Jiezi* says:\n*\"The southwest corner of a hall\"*—\ndeep and secluded, like the inner sanctum.\nTruly, the Dao is vast and undivided,\nits greatness without bounds,\nall things contained within it and sustained by it.\nIts smallness without limits,\nyet all things are also within it, unseen.\nThus, the *Xisheng Jing* says:\n*\"The Dao is profound and mysterious,\nan abyss of emptiness and nothingness.*\nThe treasure of the virtuous,\nthe refuge of the unvirtuous.\nThough a person may be unvirtuous,\nthey cannot escape relying on the Dao for life—\nthus, it is their refuge.\"\n\n**Wen Gong** said:\nThe virtuous guard and use it,\nwhile the unvirtuous also depend on the Dao for security.\nFine words can be traded,\nand noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\nHow could one abandon those who are unvirtuous?\n*行* (*xíng*), pronounced *qù-shēng* (去声).\nTruly, all people possess this nature;\neven the lowest fool cannot lack the Dao-heart.\nHow distant is the Dao from people?\nThus, the most beautiful words are known to all,\nand the most noble conduct is within everyone’s reach.\nIf someone, having committed wrong in the morning,\nhears the great Dao in the evening,\nthey will abandon their falsehood and return to their true nature—\neven if one tries to point out their wrongdoing,\nit cannot be found.\nHow could they be abandoned?\nOnly salvation is needed—\nthis is the refuge of the unvirtuous.\n\nThus, establishing the Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers,\neven with a *hongbi* jade and four-horse chariot as tribute,\nis not as precious as sitting and offering the Dao.\n*先* (*xiān*), pronounced *shì-xiàn* (悉荐切).\n*Hongbi* (*拱璧*)—a jade of perfect curvature, the finest of gems.\n*Si* (*驷马*)—four horses harnessed to a single carriage.\nIn ancient tribute rituals, when presenting a four-horse carriage,\none would lead with a *hongbi* jade.\nThough the Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers are noble by power,\nand *hongbi* and four-horse carriages are noble by material wealth,\nthey are not as noble as calmly offering the Dao.\nThe Dao is inherently possessed by all—\nthis is true nobility.\nYet the Three Ministers and *hongbi* are granted by fate,\nnot something one can casually attain.\nPeople should strive for what is inherently theirs,\nand what comes from outside is of little worth.\n\nWhy did the ancients value the Dao so highly?\nWas it not because *\"seeking leads to obtaining\"*—\nthat even crimes can be pardoned?\n\nThis is why the Dao is the most noble under heaven.\n\n**Question:** What is the meaning of valuing the Dao so highly?\nIt is because one does not seek externally but finds it within—\nthus, seeking brings benefit to obtaining.\nHe who is resolute in the Dao will have no evil.\nOnly by not relying on external means to attain it\ndoes one rise above calamity and fortune,\nand how could misfortune reach them?\nThis is why the Dao is the most noble under heaven.\n\nSome say:\n*\"Seeking leads to obtaining\"*—the treasure of the virtuous;\n*\"Crimes can be pardoned\"*—the refuge of the unvirtuous.\n\nThis is Chapter 62: *The Most Noble Under Heaven*.\n**He Shang** names it *Dao*.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao as:\n*Wuwei* (*为无为*), *wu shi* (*事无事*), *wu wei* (*味无味*).\nGreat and small, many and few—\nrepaying resentment with virtue.\n\nTo engage with form brings great and small,\nto be bound by numbers brings many and few.\nThe distinctions of great and small,\nthe divisions of many and few—\nthis is how resentment arises.\nOnly the Dao, beyond form and number, unites with the sage.\n*Wuwei* emerges from *wuwei*,\n*wu shi* from *wu shi*,\nand *wu wei* from *wu wei*—\nthus, it contains the boundless *Taipe* within the square inch,\nunburdened by the slightest private desire,\ngathering all things in the One Truth,\nunmoved by high or low, external conditions.\nThus, each thing returns to its own nature,\neach matter to its own course,\nand great and small, many and few—\nviewed as one, hatred and love vanish,\nsage and commoner alike are undone,\nand what resentment remains to be repaid?\nOnly virtue can contain it.\n\nMoreover, if one’s intentions are extinguished,\nit is like the heavens and earth covering and nurturing all without distinction.\nYet this is what common people find most difficult.\nOnly through earnest questioning and contemplation,\ngradually cultivating it,\ncan one attain this state.\n\nThe following text outlines the method of cultivation to reach perfection.\n\n*\"Difficulties arise from what is easy,\nthe great from what is small.*\nThe most difficult matters under heaven begin with ease,\nthe greatest matters under heaven begin with the minute.\nThe Dao exists in the intervals of rising, resting, eating, and breathing—\nthis is easy.\nYet when it reaches its fullness,\nonly the sage can attain it—\nthis is difficult.\"\n\nWhen one’s thoughts and deliberations have not yet arisen,\nand one is blankly void without trace—\nthis is minute indeed.\n\nYet when it fills and suffuses completely,\neven heaven and earth cannot exhaust its measure—\nthis is great.\n\nThus, gradually cultivating without a single action left unguarded,\nwhen virtue is perfected, one’s abilities align with the sage’s.\n\nWhen it is subtle yet nothing is wasted by even a hair’s breadth,\nand one attains fullness of the Dao’s essence,\nthen one’s capacity matches that of heaven and earth.\n\nOnly by being cautious at its beginning\nand not neglecting its end,\ncan the difficult be accomplished,\nand the great be fully realized.\n\nIf one speaks of resentment,\nthen human resentment also grows from the small to the great,\nand as resentment deepens, forgetting becomes more difficult.\nIf one can, at its origin, illuminate and penetrate thoroughly,\nthen it will immediately cease in stillness.\n\nThus, the sage never considers anything great,\nand so can perfect the great.\n\nThe scholar must steadfastly establish resolve with broad and unwavering purpose,\nyet most cannot harbor a heart of \"greatness\" beforehand.\nIf one harbors such a heart,\nthen one will surely fall prey to arrogance and self-conceit,\nwhich only obstructs the Dao—\nthus failing to act in non-action (*wuwei*),\nto manage non-affairs (*wushi*),\nor to savor non-savor (*wuwèi*).\n\nOnly the sage can transcend self,\nand so their heart remains ever small,\nthus enabling them to perfect the great.\n\nLight promises bring few trusts,\nexcessive ease invites many difficulties.\nIt is because of their crudeness and lack of refinement,\nthat their words lack resilience and their deeds fail to harmonize,\nand a neglectful attitude toward ease takes root—\nthis is why they find the Dao so hard to attain.\n\nThus, the sage regards difficulty as difficulty,\nand so ultimately faces no difficulty.\n\nThe sage is born knowing and acts naturally,\ncertainly not needing exhortation before attaining ability,\nyet how could they neglect it?\n\nFor virtue and capacity are equal,\nunifying small and great,\none and many,\nwithout any deficiency—\nwithout any difficulty,\nfor there is nothing beyond their reach.\n\nThis again exhorts the scholar:\nnever to have a moment’s neglect of what is easy,\nthen their resolve will be bold,\ntheir adherence firm,\nand their caution at the end like that at the beginning—\nand so they too will face no difficulty.\n\n**Chapter 63**\n*Named \"Enshǐ\" by Heshang*\nThis chapter elucidates the sage’s complete attainment of the Dao.\n\nIts ease is firm in practice,\nits foresight is simple in planning,\nits fragility is simple in nurturing,\nits subtlety is simple in dispersing.\n\nAct upon it while it is yet unseen,\norder it while it is yet undisturbed.\n\n**Chapter 64**\n*Named \"Shǒuwēi\" by Heshang*\nThis chapter praises the sage’s learning of *wuwei*, warning against the faults of action and attachment.\n\n**Fragility**—*ruì*, pronounced with the *ruǐ* rhyme—refers to the tender, easily broken state, meaning desires are not yet firm. **Dispersion**—*pàn*—is like ice melting. This too follows the meaning of the previous chapter: if preserved when it has not yet sprouted, it becomes one with nature, hence *\"easy to hold, easy to plan.\"* If observed at the moment of first sprouting, it will not stray far before returning, hence *\"easy to nurture, easy to disperse.\"* **\"Unseen\"** refers to the time of *wuwei* and *wuwei*—when there is no thought, no action. **\"Undisturbed\"** refers to the time when it is just beginning and has not yet sunk into disorder. To act and govern at this moment means success without effort.\n\nYet reason arises suddenly, and enlightenment dissipates suddenly, while practice does not achieve perfection all at once—only through gradual cultivation. Hence, the following text speaks of nurturing virtue.\n\nA tree of embrace grows from the smallest sprout;\nA nine-tiered tower begins with a clod of earth;\nA thousand-*li* journey starts beneath one’s feet.\nThese are words of exhortation, saying:\nOne must establish resolve beyond things and act with reverence within them—knowing and acting, striving for substance and root, never neglecting the minute, never overlooking the humble. Cultivate with meticulous care, nurture with enduring patience, and thus even the small may become great, the low may rise high, and the distant may be reached.\n\nYet if even a thread of scheming for gain or calculating success enters first, it will only hinder the Dao. Hence, it is further elaborated:\n\nThose who act will fail;\nThose who cling will lose.\nThus, *wuwei* means no failure,\nAnd *wuji* (non-attachment) means no loss.\nThe people’s undertakings often falter when nearly complete.\nIf one remains as cautious at the end as at the beginning, there will be no failed endeavors.\n\n*Jǐ*—level tone—\nFor Heaven’s principles are subtle and profound; private intelligence has no part in them. Thus, those who exert intention act with *wei*, and those who relax even slightly fail. Only by guarding with spontaneity does true strength accumulate over time, and virtue naturally form.\n\nTherefore, the sage desires what others do not desire,\nAnd values not the hard-to-obtain treasures.\nHe learns what others do not learn,\nReturning to the errors of the common people.\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things\nWithout daring to act.\n\nThe Dao is without desire—\nBy \"desire,\" it means seeking what is within oneself.\nNot desiring external things as noble,\nTrue learning is *wuwei*—\nNot indulging in excessive knowledge as learning,\nBut only returning to the common people’s excesses of emotion and desire,\nRestoring them to their origin.\n\nThis Dao was never sought externally,\nNor could the sage make it a model for others.\nMoreover, all things have their own natural Dao.\nThe sage only follows the principles of nature and life to establish teaching,\nGuiding them to balance without daring to artificially benefit or aid growth.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 65**\n*Named \"Chúndé\" by Heshang*\nThis chapter clarifies how using intelligence breeds delusion, demonstrating the rule of profound virtue’s great harmony. Was this Laozi’s foresight of inevitable worldly changes, or did he bear a heart of concern?\n\nThe rivers and seas become kings of the valleys\nBecause they excel in descending.\nThus, the sage who wishes to be above others\nSpeaks in a manner that descends;\nWho wishes to lead others\nPlaces himself behind them.\n\n「Thus, when one is in the highest position yet others do not feel burdened,\nWhen one is at the forefront yet others are not harmed,\nThe world finds joy in recommending and supporting him without growing weary,\nFor he does not contend, so none contend with him.\n\nHe excels in descending—both in speech and in action.\n*下* rhymes with *暇*, *乐* rhymes with *洛*.\nThe *Yǔ Zhù* says: *\"Lún Chūjiǔ\"* states,\n*\"With noble descending upon lowly, great favor is won from the people.\"*\nIndeed, it is by winning their hearts.\n\nWhen one is in the highest position yet others do not feel burdened,\nThey revere him with trepidation;\nWhen one is at the forefront yet others are not harmed,\nMany benefit from him willingly.\n\nIf such is the case, there is no thought that does not submit,\nHence, he is never weary of the world’s support.\nThe sage adapts to the times, conforming to changes through the Dao,\nDoes he seek profit? It is merely the virtue of humility in action.\n\nDescend in virtue, and one’s form ascends;\nRetreat in virtue, and one’s form leads.\nYang Xióng said:\n*\"He who descends himself is exalted by others;\nHe who places himself behind is placed ahead by others.\"*\nThus, the world delights in recommending and supporting him without tiring,\nThis is the Dao’s virtue of non-contention.\n\n---\n**Chapter 66**\n*Named \"Fùjǐ\" by Heshang*\nThis chapter elucidates the virtue of descending without contention.\n\nThe world all deems my Dao great,\nYet it appears unorthodox.\nOnly because it is great,\nDoes it seem unorthodox.\nIf it were orthodox for long,\nHow could it be considered great?\n\n*音* rhymes with *扶*.\nIf it resembles something,\nThen it is no different from that thing—\nHow could it be great?\n\nXītáng Zhèng Xiá said:\n*\"The Dao is vast while things are small.\nMen’s ceaseless striving yet ultimately clinging to smallness—\nThis is their entanglement in things.\"*\n\n*Yuán* refers to the utmost of virtue reaching greatness.\nIf one attains greatness yet does not recognize it as such,\nThen he aligns with the Dao and does not conform to worldly norms,\nThus the world deems my Dao great yet unorthodox.\n\nI possess three treasures—treasures to uphold.\nFirst: **compassion** (*cí*),\nSecond: **frugality** (*jiǎn*),\nThird: **not daring to lead the world**.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous;\nThe virtuous must have courage.\nFrugality makes one expansive;\nTo guard moderation while giving generously.\nNot daring to lead the world,\nThus one attains enduring leadership.\n*长* is pronounced with the rising tone.\n\nBy placing oneself behind, one’s form leads,\nHence, he ultimately becomes the leader of all things.\n\nThe *Gàn* text states:\n*\"When the *Shēn* dragon emerges, if it lacks a head, it is auspicious.\"*\n\nThese three treasures all differ from worldly norms,\nThus they are considered great.\n\nIf one abandons compassion and courage,\nIf one abandons frugality and expansiveness,\nIf one abandons retreat and leadership,\nThen he dies.\n\nTo abandon one’s foundation for superficial gain,\nThis is how one falls into exhaustion.\nThus, those who are harsh and boastful,\nWho love to advance themselves,\nAre all doomed to perish.\n\nCompassion—when wielded in battle, it conquers;\nWhen used in defense, it secures.\nWhen Heaven intends to rescue one,\nIt shields him with compassion.\n\nCompassion is the means by which the Dao of life flows and thrives,\nIt is the function of the *biàn*—\nThus, it is the foremost of the three treasures.\n\nTo govern with compassion,\nThings respond as if drawn to a beloved parent;\nThey would even die for him without hesitation—\nThus, in battle he conquers,\nIn defense he secures,\nHence it is said: *\"The virtuous have no rival under Heaven.\"*\n\nIf someone falls short in any way,\nHeaven will still rescue and shield him with compassion—\nThis is the Dao’s principle of reciprocity,\nFor Heaven’s nature loves to return,\nEver favoring the good.\n\nWén Jiǎn said:\n*\"To depart from unity and embrace division—\nThis is how the Dao rescues.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter 67**\n*Named \"Sān Bǎo\" by Heshang*\nThis chapter clarifies that the Dao’s essence is supreme,\nYet its practice relies on compassion.\n\nThe virtuous scholar does not resort to force,\nHe does not valorize strength.」\n\n**Chapter 67**\n*Named \"Sān Bǎo\" (Three Treasures) by Heshang*\nThis chapter declares that though the Dao’s essence is supreme,\nIts practice rests upon compassion.\n\nThe virtuous warrior does not rage,\nNor fights unless compelled—\nSuch conflict does not spring from private desires.\nThe one who best conquers foes does not contend,\nFor it is only the heart that does not contend\nWhich can overcome the contending of others.\nThose greedy for victory who strike first are certain to fail.\nThe adept at using others places himself beneath them.\nWhen his virtue is humble and yielding,\nOthers gladly serve him—\nFor his sincerity evokes their willingness to labor.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThis is called the power of using others,\nThis is called the ancient harmony with Heaven’s extreme.\n\nOnly through non-contention and yielding\nDoes one abandon cleverness and artifice,\nFollow Heaven’s natural order,\nAnd thus align with Heaven’s own virtue.\n\nMaster Wén Jiǎn said:\n*\"When virtue merges with Heaven,\nIt surpasses all since the birth of humanity.\"*\n\n**Chapter 68**\n*Named \"Pèi Tiān\" (Harmony with Heaven) by Heshang*\nThis chapter sets forth four virtues to illustrate the harmony with Heaven.\n\nIn wielding arms, there is a saying:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,\nI dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot.\"*\n\nThis is called:\n*\"Moving without movement,\nWarding off without arms,\nResisting without enemies,\nGrasping without weapons.\"*\n*(行: Upper as in the character, lower pronounced as *hù jiàng* (户刚切).)*\n\nMaster Wén Dìng said:\n*\"To act is to be the aggressor (*主*),\nTo respond is to be the defender (*客*).\nTo advance is to harbor intent for contention,\nTo retreat is to lack such intent.\nOnly when one lacks intent for contention\nDoes wielding arms equal not wielding at all—\nThus it is hard to advance but easy to retreat.\nEven amid war’s chaos,\nIf there is no movement to be made,\nNo arms to wield,\nNo enemies to resist,\nNo weapons to seize,\nHow could there ever be blame for wielding arms?\"*\n\nNo greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy—\nUnderestimating the enemy risks losing one’s treasure.\nThus, when armies clash in battle,\nThe compassionate prevail.\n\n*(几: Level tone.\n丧: Departing tone, meaning \"lose.\"\n抗: To raise/lift.)*\n\nMaster Wén Dìng said:\n*\"Since compassion is the treasure,\nTo underestimate the enemy is to lighten the fight,\nTo lighten the fight is to risk killing—\nThis is to lose what one holds dear.\nWhen two armies raise their forces in conflict,\nAnd I act only when compelled,\nThen my heart is filled with pity for slaughter—\nWhen pity is seen, Heaven and humanity aid me.\nThough I might wish not to conquer,\nIt cannot be helped.\"*\n\n**Chapter 69**\n*Named \"Xuànyòng\" (Mysterious Application) by Heshang*\nThis chapter uses the metaphor of warfare to elucidate the Dao,\nWith the key resting in safeguarding compassion.\n\nSome say:\n*\"If applied to the human body,\nThen wicked thoughts are more numerous than enemy states,\nAnd desires for gain surpass the sharpest blades—\nIs this not also the case of few desires reaching the state of no desires,\nThus preserving one’s treasure?\"*\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to practice.\nYet none under Heaven can know them,\nNone can practice them.\n\nHuman nature is inherently fixed and shared—\nPointing this out to others,\nIt should seem as though there is nothing difficult to know or practice.\nYet Heaven’s principles are vast and undivided—\nIf one deviates by even a hair’s breadth,\nThe error grows vast as a thousand miles,\nFor it cannot be illuminated by calculation.\nThus, those who overthink exceed the mark,\nWhile those who forget fall short—\nHence none can truly know it.\n\nIt cannot be reached by gradual steps—\nThose who seek quick gains favor shortcuts,\nWhile those lacking strength abandon half the path—\nHence none can truly practice it.\n\nWords have their root,\nAffairs have their master.\nWords are the elucidation of the Dao,\nAffairs are the manifestation of the Dao.\nTeaching without words,\nActing without action—\nIs this not the root and the master?\n\nThis is why the dull-witted and the obstructed\nCannot know or practice it.\n\nOnly because of their lack of knowing\nAre they not known by me.\n\nMaster Wén Dìng said:\n*\"The ancient sages had no thoughts, no actions,\nYet there remained those who were vaguely unaware of their own existence.\nThis is beyond the reach of deliberation—\nThus none ever truly knew them.\"*\n\nFew know me,\nHence my worth is great.\n\nMaster Wén Jiǎn said:\n*\"The Dao is vast,\nThus few understand it.\"*\n\nHence the sage wears coarse garments while treasuring jade.\n*(The Commentary says:\n*\"The sage conceals himself in Heaven without boasting or startling others.\")*\n\nQīngyuán Zǐ said:\n*\"To wear coarse garments is to blend with the common dust,\nTo treasure jade is to embrace the Dao and nurture virtue.\"*\n\nMaster Wén Jiǎn said:\n*\"Coarse garments are the necessities of daily life,\nShared by all the world.\nJade is the most precious of goods,\nUnique to me alone.\nFew know me—\nThis alone reveals the Dao’s summit.\nYet the sage does not flaunt his differences,\nFor even his most profound and unknowable mysteries\nAre displayed in the mundane and shared,\nSo that all may grasp them.\nThis is what Confucius meant by:\n*'I have no secrets from you.'*\"*\n\n**Chapter 70**\n*Named \"Zhī Nán\" (Knowing Difficulty) by Heshang*\nThis chapter shows that the Dao is very easy to know and practice,\nYet overlooked, it becomes very difficult.\n\nTo know what one does not know—this is excellence;\nTo not know what one knows—this is illness.\n\nOnly true knowing\nUnites with the Dao,\nThus it is not hindered by knowledge—\nThis is the virtue’s summit.\n\nIf one does not reach true knowing\nYet claims to know,\nThen he destroys substance with words,\nDrowns the mind in superficiality—\nTo force knowing is to fall ill,\nThis is the virtue’s disease.\n\nOnly because of illness\nDoes one avoid illness.\nThe sage’s non-illness\nComes from his illness of illness—\nThus he avoids illness.\n\nOnly because he knows illness for what it is\nDoes he not fall into it.\n\nThe sage is born knowing—\nHis illness is inherently nonexistent,\nNo need to diagnose his illness\nBefore attaining the state of non-illness.\n\nTo say *\"illness of illness\"*\nIs to show the student the medicine of illness,\nSo that he diagnoses the sickness of forced knowing\nAnd awakens to true knowing, dispelling his illness—\nThen illness and medicine are both removed,\nAbilities and objects vanish together,\nAnd he begins to realize:\n*\"From the start, there was no illness at all.\"*\nThus he aligns with the sage.\n\n「Only humans are shackled by the private confines of form and matter,\nDrowned in the delusion of common illusions,\nFearful of life and death,\nDreading gain and loss.\nThus the myriad threats of all things assail them,\nAnd they tremble all their lives.\n\nThere is such a great threat, yet they do not know it.\nIf they truly know it,\nLife and death are equalized,\nGain and loss are balanced—\nBoldly advancing, acting without hesitation,\nThen this great threat shines clearly before them.\n\nDo not narrow their dwelling,\nDo not weary of their birth.\nOnly because one does not weary of it,\nIs one able not to weary of it.\n\n*\"Narrow\"* (狭) is pronounced *xu* (胡夹切), meaning confined.\n*\"Weary\"* (厌) is pronounced *yàn* (於艳切), meaning to abandon.\n\n*\"Do not\"* (无) should be rendered as *\"must not\"* (毋).\n\nTheir dwelling is the ground of their nature—\nTo dwell in the vastness of all things,\nThen they align their substance with the Great Void.\n\nTheir birth is the gathering of *qi*—\nContaining the utmost essence of the Great One,\nThen they share their function with Creation.\n\nOnly the *curved scholars* (曲士) cannot be spoken to of the Dao.\nIf they do not drown in petty transformations,\nAnd truly embody what is without,\nThen they narrow their dwelling by clinging to the *\"no\"* and abandoning the *\"yes\"*,\nAnd are obscured by the doctrine of annihilation,\nWearying of their birth.\n\nThus I teach them: *\"Must not narrow, must not weary,\"*\nSo that students may know:\nNature is the leader of *qi*,\nAnd its greatness is boundless—\nThey must expand and fill it to preserve its fullness.\nBirth is the abode of the Dao,\nAnd its function is inexhaustible—\nThey must cherish and nurture it to achieve its purpose.\n\nThen nurturing *qi* preserves life,\nExhausting nature reaches the vital principle,\nAnd they do not generate a heart of weary attachment,\nThus embodying *\"no non-force, no non-stubbornness,\"*\nAnd *\"long life is not the fault of life, nor is life an obstacle.\"*\n\nIf this is so,\nThen life and the Dao dwell together,\nAnd the Dao has never truly abandoned humans.\n\nThus the sage knows himself without revealing himself,\nLoves himself without esteeming himself,\nHence he discards the latter to take the former.\n\n*\"Revealing\"* (见) is pronounced *xiàn* (贤遍切), meaning to display.\n*\"Discards\"* (去) is pronounced with an ascending tone.\n\nTo know himself is to return to fearless self-reflection,\nNot narrowing his dwelling.\nTo love himself is to cut off external desires,\nNot wearying of his birth.\n\nOnly through self-knowing and self-loving\nDoes one dwell in security.\n\nAnd by not revealing himself to boast of his abilities,\nNot esteeming himself to belittle things,\nHe has no heart to know what is revealed,\nNor to forget what is loved.\n\nWen Ding said:\n*\"Even though one knows himself,\nHe must not reveal himself to others;\nEven though one loves himself,\nHe must not esteem himself to dazzle others—\nFor fear that others will weary or covet.\"*\n\nAs long as this heart is not forgotten,\nThere will still be fear.\nFear departs only when the great threat arrives,\nThus he discards the self-revealing and self-esteeming,\nAnd takes the self-knowing and self-loving.\n\nYet the sage’s movement and stillness are both in accordance with Heavenly Principle,\nWith no discarding or taking—\nThis is the teaching that opens the Dao and guides the common folk.\n\n---\n**Chapter 72** (河上名爱己)\nHeavenly River names *\"Love Oneself.\"*\nThis chapter dispels false delusions to preserve the true.\n\nTo be bold in daring is to kill,\nTo be bold in not daring is to live.\nThese two are either beneficial or harmful.\nWhat Heaven detests, who knows its reason?\n\nThus the sage finds it difficult.\n*\"Detests\"* (恶) is pronounced with a falling tone—\nThe strong and rigid are destined for death,\nBoldness here leads to killing and harm.\n\nThe gentle and yielding are in accordance with life’s principle,\nBoldness here leads to living and benefit.\nThis is an immutable law,\nYet sometimes it reverses its norm—\nHence, *\"either beneficial or harmful.\"*\n\nThe strong and rigid are destined for death,\nTruly what Heaven detests.\nIf they escape by chance and have not yet suffered their fate,\nWho can know its reason?\nThus the sage finds it difficult.\n\nLiezi said:\n*\"To meet Heaven’s intent,\nTo weigh benefit and harm—\nIt is better to let it be.\"*\n\nThis is indeed so.\nYet to exhaust its end and witness its full change,\nThere is never a moment without loss—\nHence the following passage elaborates upon it.\n\nWen Gong said:\n*\"The sage, regarding Heavenly Dao,\nDares not alter its words.*\n\nThe Dao of Heaven\nIs victorious without contention,\nWen Gong said:\n*\"To let things follow their natural course,\nAnd things cannot defy it.\"*\n\nIt responds without words,\nHeaven speaks of what?\nThe seasons proceed in their order—\nIts response to rewarding virtue and punishing licentiousness\nIs indeed without error.\n\nIt comes without being summoned,\nThe divine’s approach is spontaneous—\nThere is no favor or aversion,\nAs summer departs and winter arrives—\nHow could it await a summons before coming?\n\nIt is tranquil yet ever-strategic.\nYu’s Commentary says:\n*\"Virtue and conduct are always easily known,\nYet the perilous is discerned through them.\"*\n\nHeaven’s net is vast and encompassing,\nSparse yet never failing.\n\n*\"Fail\"* (失) may also be written as *\"leak\"* (漏).\n---\n**Chapter 73** (河上名任为)\nHeavenly River names *\"Act in Accordance.\"*\n\nThis chapter instructs that one must be bold in the Dao,\nNot bold in force.\nIt continues to clarify Heavenly Dao’s natural course,\nAnd concludes with a warning of Heaven’s net’s inexhaustibility,\nSo that people may believe it without doubt.\n\nThe people commonly do not fear death,\nHow can one frighten them with death?\n\nIf one makes the people constantly fear death,\nAnd treats them as if they were strange anomalies,\nI would seize and execute them—\nWho would dare?\n\nWen Ding said:\n*\"Governance is burdensome and punishments are severe,*\nThen the people have no place to rest their hands and feet,\nThus they commonly do not fear death—\nEven if one frightens them with death,\nIt is of no benefit.\"*\n\nIf the people are at ease with governance,\nThen they always delight in life and fear death.\nIf there are deceitful or rebellious ones who disturb the group,\nThen I would seize and execute them—\nWho would dare not submit?\n\nThere are always those who hold the power of execution killing,\nAnd those who take their place killing—\nThis is like substituting for the Master Carpenter.\n\nTo substitute for the Master Carpenter\nIs to risk injuring one’s hands.\n\nWen Ding said:\n*\"Those who hold the power of execution are Heaven,\nAre Principle.\nIn the world’s governance,\nIf deceitful or rebellious ones act freely,\nThen they are abandoned by Heaven—\nTo kill them is for Heaven to kill,\nNot for me.\"*\n\nOtherwise, it is to substitute for those who hold the power of execution killing—\nTo substitute for the Master Carpenter is to injure one’s hands,\nTo substitute for those who hold the power of execution killing is to involve oneself in the act.\n\nSheng Yi川 said:\n*\"Those who have not yet attained virtue\nAnd first engage in deeds and achievements—\nAre akin to this.\"*\n\n**Chapter 74: *Heshang* [Riverbank] on \"Naming Deception\"**\nThis chapter states that when the ruler does nothing, the people know how to exhort themselves.\n\nMaster Zhang of History said:\n*\"Things are not feared for lack of those who kill them—\nAll things, left unchecked, will inevitably decay until they perish,\nand thus there are always those who execute judgment.\nBut if one usurps the role of executioner out of fear,\nnot only will it fail to deter things,\nbut it will also miss its mark entirely.\nTherefore, to wield the power of life and death over the people,\ndriving the world to follow you—\nthis is surely not the way.\n\nThe people’s hunger stems from the heavy taxes of their rulers—\nthus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed stems from the ruler’s interference—\nthus they are hard to govern.\nThe *Yuzhu* [Official Commentary] says:\n*'Heavy taxation leaves the people impoverished,\nexcessive governance breeds deceit and falsehoods.'\n\nPeople grow reckless with death\nbecause their rulers overvalue life—\nthus they grow reckless with death.\nThe *Yuzhu* says:\n*'When life is indulged too greatly,\ngreed for gain becomes relentless;\nno depravity or extravagance is left undone.'\n\nWen Ding said:\n*'When rulers prioritize their own desires over the people,\nthe people likewise vie to enrich their own lives—\neven in death, they will not cease pursuing gain.\nOnly those who do not cling to life\nare wiser than those who do.'*\n\nMaster Wen of the Tang said:\n*'To set oneself apart is to preserve oneself.'*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 75: *Heshang* on \"Acquisitiveness as Diminishment\"**\nThis chapter warns against the harm of interference,\nfor only by forgetting life can one preserve it.\n\nWang Bi’s commentary suggests this chapter may not be by Laozi.\n\n*\"The living are soft and weak,\nthe dead are rigid and strong.\nGrass and trees, when living, are soft and brittle,\nwhen dead, withered and dry.\nThus, rigidity and strength belong to death,\nwhile softness and weakness belong to life.\nWen Ding said:\n*'When the unobstructed *qi* flows within,\nthe body knows no rigidity or strength.\nWhen the supreme Principle abides,\naffairs bear no burden of rigidity or strength.'\n\nThus, strong armies do not conquer,\nstrong trees are felled.\nTherefore, rigidity and strength belong below,\nsoftness and weakness belong above.\n*Gong* [共], as in the text, means ‘the people collectively fell it.’\n\nLiezi said:\n*'Strong armies perish, strong trees break.'\nThis is correct.\n\nThe refined essence of things always resides above,\nwhile the coarse always settles below.\nThe refined must be soft,\nthe coarse must be strong—\nthis is the natural order.\nYet in the world, there has never been one who was rigid and strong\nyet able to stand above others.\nZhuangzi said:\n*'To display meekness and humility as a standard.'\nThis is so.\n\nThe Master of True Perfection said:\n*'Those who excel at overcoming enemies do not contend—\nfor their intent is not in strength.'\n\nWhen wood grows strong and large,\npeople will surely fell it together.\nArms achieve victory through softness and weakness,\ntrees endure through softness and weakness.\nThus, rigidity and strength belong below,\nwhile softness and weakness belong above—\nhuman nature is no different.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 76: *Heshang* on \"Warn Against Strength\"**\nThis chapter states that softness and weakness can preserve the unobstructed and harmonious *qi*.\n\n*\"The Way of Heaven—\nis it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nthe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nThe Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.\nBut the Way of man is otherwise—\nthey diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.\nThe Way of Heaven is impartial,\nalways aligning with the mean,\nso fullness invites diminishment,\nhumility invites benefit—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\n\nYe Mengde said:\n*'The archer draws the bow before releasing—\nthis too is a gathering unto oneself\nbefore bestowing upon things.\nWith evenness as the master and harmony as the constant,\nit aligns with the Way of Heaven,\nso its raising and lowering, its excess and deficiency—\nnone fail to meet their measure.\nIts taking does not come from without,\nfor it arises naturally,\nthus it is impartial and balanced.\n\nBut man is otherwise—\nhe does not seek within,\nthus he always diminishes the deficient\nto serve his own excess,\nforcing the issue,\nthus he is partial and unbalanced.\n\nThe *Kaiyuan* commentary cites:\n*'Diminishing the upper to benefit the lower is benefit,\ndiminishing the lower to benefit the upper is diminishment'—\nthe meaning of the two *gua* [trigrams] is clear.\n\nWho can diminish the excessive\nand serve the deficient throughout the world?\nOnly the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Sage acts yet does not rely upon it,\ncompletes the work yet does not dwell upon it.\nIs this not because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous?\n\nOnly the one who follows the Dao can do what Heaven does,\nyet does not rely upon his doing,\nnor dwell upon his work.\nIf one acts yet relies upon it,\nand dwells upon his work,\nthen the virtuous will be seen in the world.\nWhen the virtuous are seen in the world,\nit is because they serve their own excess.\n\n---\n*Chapter LXXVII* – *Heshang* names this *Tian Dao*.\nThis chapter clarifies that the Dao’s use is upright and impartial,\nand only by observing Heaven’s Way can one know it.\nThe Sage aligns with it.\n\nNothing is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing can overcome the firm and strong.\nThis is because nothing can replace it.\nSince water’s nature is to be gentle and yielding,\nit does not lose itself yet conquers all things.\nThe yielding overcomes the rigid,\nthe weak overcomes the strong—\nall know this, yet none can practice it.\nObserving water reveals its lesson,\nfor truth is near and principle is clear—\nhow difficult can it be to know?\nOnly those who do not deeply trust the Dao fail to act.\n\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the nation’s filth is to be its sovereign;\nto bear the nation’s calamities is to be its king.\"*\n\n*Wen Gong* says:\n*\"To contain filth and absorb impurities is to achieve greatness.\nUpright speech seems contrary.*\nUpright speech aligns with the Dao,\nyet appears contrary to the common,\nfor it opposes the shallow wisdom of near-emotion,\nand thus aligns with the supreme Dao’s rectitude.\"*\n\n---\n*Chapter LXXVIII* – *Heshang* names this *Ren Xin*.\nThis chapter speaks of yielding gentleness,\nso all things turn to it.\n\nTo reconcile great grievances,\nthere must remain excess grievance—\nhow can this be called good?\nGrievance arises from delusion;\nawakening from delusion reveals truth—\nwhere then is grievance?\nNow, if one does not treat the root\nyet seeks to reconcile the branches,\nthough outwardly reconciled,\ninternally it is not forgotten—\nthis is excess grievance,\nhow can it be called good?\nIf one penetrates to the root,\nthen true forgetting is serene and still.\n\nThus the Sage holds the left contract,\nyet does not demand accountability from others.\nContracts have left and right,\nto establish trust and end contention.\nThe Sage shares this nature with all people,\nyet people, lost in delusion,\nchase after contention and strife,\nthus they are confused by great grievance\nand forget their root,\nunaware of their true nature’s non-delusion.\nTherefore the Sage holds fast to this original uprightness,\nthough he does not seek enlightenment from others,\nyet people are moved by his transformation.\nWhen delusion is exhausted and grievance released,\nall spontaneously attain clarity,\nreturning to their inherent goodness and alignment—\njust as the right contract fits the left.\nWhat need is there for demands?\n\nThe left contract is like the prior awakening of nature.\n*Qingyuanzi* says:\n*\"In ancient times, they tied knots to govern,\nand split wood to make contracts—\nthe ruler held the left, the subject the right.\nWhen the contracts met, trust was established.\nThus, the virtuous held the contracts,\nthe unvirtuous held the pass-through.\nThe virtuous required no words to be trusted,\nfor they governed without action,\nyet people transformed of their own accord—\njust as holding the contract.\nThe pass-through means ‘to pass through’—\nthose without virtue desire all to pass through them,\nthus they eagerly seek to reconcile grievances.\nHeaven’s Way has no favorites,\nyet it always aligns with the virtuous.\"*\n\n*Qingyuanzi* says:\n*\"The contract’s impartiality is like this—\nonly the fitting attain it.\"*\n\n*Huan* says:\n*\"Those who do good do not seek from others,\nnor from Heaven—\nthey simply trust in its natural coming.\"*\n\n---\n*Chapter LXXIX* – *Heshang* names this *Ren Qi*.\nThis chapter clarifies that extinguishing delusion lies in restoring nature—\nall are governed by non-action.\n\nIn small states with few people,\nlet the people have tenfold or hundredfold tools yet not use them.\nWith sparse population and simple duties,\nthe ruler has no need to prize the virtuous,\nwhile the people each rest in their natural allotments of Heaven.\nEven if there are village tools sufficient for ten, hundred, or thousandfold leadership,\nthey do not seek use in the world.\nFor when words prevail and desires are exhausted,\npeople grow self-sufficient and boastful in outward display,\nthus this is held up to instruct the governance of antiquity,\nand to encourage the study of inward cultivation.\n\nLet the people hold death in reverence\nand not wander far.\nNurturing nature without desire,\nthey settle in their land and do not migrate.\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nthey have no use for them;\nthough there are armor and weapons,\nthey have no need to array them.\n\nLet the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\nWithout competition for profit, without contentious strife,\nthus the return to knotted cords is sufficient.\n\nThey find their food sweet, their clothing fine,\ntheir customs settled, their occupations joyous.\nWith inner sufficiency and no external longings,\nthey take delight in their own nature alone,\nso that wherever they go, they find contentment within themselves.\nThus, even in barren and desolate places,\nthey deem them sweet, fine, settled, and joyous—\nfor their joy lies in the Dao, not in things.\n\nNeighboring lands lie in view, yet the sounds of roosters and dogs reach one another,\nwhile the people live out their lives and die without ever visiting one another.\n*\"望音亡\"*—when the sight of music fades—\nis akin to *\"望冠盖\"*—when the sight of official carriages fades.\nThis is so because of their lack of desire and want.\n\n---\n**Eighty Chapters of the Yellow River School (Heshang Bingli):**\nThis chapter clarifies that when one settles into one’s natural allotment,\nthere is nothing to aspire to or seek.\n\n*\"True words are not ornate; ornate words are not true.\"*\nTruth aligns with reality and the Dao, so it need not be adorned;\nornamentation pleases others, so it may not be true.\n\n*\"The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\"*\nMaster Wen defined it thus:\nIf virtue is the priority, there is no need for argument;\nif argument is the priority, it may not be virtuous.\n\n*\"The wise are not erudite; they grasp the One through which all things pass—\nwhat need have they of breadth?\nThe erudite do not know.\nThose drowned in breadth may not know the Dao.\"*\n\n*\"The Sage accumulates nothing.\nThe more they give to others, the more they possess;\nthe more they share with others, the more they have.\"*\n\n*\"为\"* (for), phonetically akin to *\"伪\"* (deceit), is assistance.\nThe Sage embodies unity in their very being—\nthe One itself stands unestablished, so what accumulation could there be?\nThey hold nothing in reserve, exchange nothing with the world,\nserene and unadorned, without self-interest alone.\n\nThus, they extend their virtue to others without depletion,\nand impart the Dao to others without exhaustion.\n\nMaster Cao remarked:\n*\"The Sage’s body is empty yet responds with perfect aptitude.\"*\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;\nThe Dao of the Sage acts without contention.\n\n「Wén Dìng remarked: *\"If power can benefit others, then it can also harm them.\nIf strength suffices to act, then it suffices to contend.\nYet able to benefit and harm without ever harming,\nable to act and contend without ever contending—\nthis is how the Sage follows the Dao of Heaven,\nand thus surpasses all others to become the progenitor of all things.\"*\n\n**This concludes the 81st chapter.**\nThe *Hé Shàng* [河上] Master expounds upon the essence of *Dào Dé* [Dao/Virtue], establishing *kě Dào kě míng* [可道可名]—that which can be spoken and named—as the fundamental principle of teaching.\nNext, he distinguishes *shàng Dé xià Dé* [上德下德]—superior and inferior virtue—and describes the varying simplicity and refinement according to the times.\n\nThis chapter conveys trust in beauty to illuminate the spoken teachings,\ndiscusses skillful argumentation to caution practitioners,\nexplains the understanding of breadth to show the distinction between confusion and enlightenment,\nand expounds on the principle of *wú jī* [无积]—non-accumulation—to instruct those who would abandon excess.\nIt borrows the concept of *yǒu duō* [有多]—abundance—to elucidate the nature of the Law.\nFinally, it unites the Dao of Heaven to discuss the Sage.\n\nTo lead scholars to grasp the profound subtleties within reason,\nand to forget the means and symbols beyond the words—\nthus, one may comprehend the teachings and yet forget them,\nand attain the end.\n\nThis is the grand intent of the annotator.»\n\nThe *Dào Dé Zhēn Jīng Jí Jiě* [道德真经集解] concludes here.\n\n**Annotations:**\n＃1 *\"Power\"* originally read as *\"贽\"* (bì, tribute), corrected from the *Shí Wàn Běn*

are crafted yet the initial intent of the *Chūn Qiū* [春秋] is obscured.\nThe *Hé Shàng* Master divides the chapters and defines the sentences,\nwhile the *Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] blends the unified Dao into a scattered whole.\n\nThe Dao is beyond words,\nyet the Sage seeks to awaken people’s understanding,\nto make them know that Heaven and Earth’s vast completeness\nis wordless and unattainable.\nThis text is the grand path to attaining the Dao;\nscholars who follow it shall naturally find their return.\n\nWhen the *Hé Shàng* Master and others interweave their interpretations,\ntheir annotations become chaotic,\nand some may begin to lament the lost sheep and divergent paths.\n\nThe *Guī Shān* [圭山] collection’s annotations—\nare they not meant to illuminate the murky way within the obscured?\nThose who cling to the *Yóu Rén* [涂人]’s [lost traveler’s] perspective\nand question the *Gù Lú* [故庐] [old dwelling]—\nby this path, they may directly grasp the *Lǎo Zǐ*’s unified essence.\n\nI praise their earnest dedication and correct articulation,\nand thus commend this single annotation.\n\n---\n\nIn ancient times, Confucius had no fixed teacher,\nso figures like *Cháng Hóng* [苌弘], *Shī Xiāng* [师襄], *Lǎo Cōng* [老聪], and *Zhèng Zǐ* [郑子] all sought his counsel.\nYet observing his words,\nonly *Nán Gōng Jìng Shū* [南宫敬叔] inquired about the origins of rites and music,\nand the essence of *Dào Dé* [Dao/Virtue], from *Lǎo Dān* [老聃].\nCould *Lǎo Dān* truly be compared to those below *Cháng Hóng*?\nThe criticism of *Yuán Rǎng* [原壤] stemmed from his study of *Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] falling short of the Master’s Dao—\nthis was not a disparagement.\n\nThough Confucius grounded his teachings in tangible reality,\nand *Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] sought the Dao in emptiness—\nConfucius held that *Tài Jí* [太极], *Liǎng Yí* [两仪], *Sì Xiàng* [四象], and *Bā Guà* [八卦] were the foundation of all life,\nwhile *Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] declared:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two, Two gives birth to Three, Three gives birth to all things\"*—\ntheir numbers differ as well.\n\nConfucius wished people to know\nthat the Dao encompasses all things, is present everywhere, and never ceases;\n*Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] wished people to seek\nthe Dao in the beginning of Heaven, Earth, and all things.\nThe Dao is singular,\nyet its manifestations vary with each person’s focus.\nThe numbers are singular,\nyet their applications differ with each person’s use.\n\nTheir differences cannot be forced into uniformity.\n\nYet in embracing simplicity and preserving purity,\nin cultivating few desires and minimal self-interest to govern the heart,\nin nurturing the spirit and holding to the One,\nin extending gently and maintaining continuity to govern the body,\nin treating substance as the root of lightness,\nin treating stillness as the root of action,\nin not boasting, not claiming credit, and not contending to respond to things,\nin acting without action and desiring without desire,\nin removing excess and moderation to govern the state and the world—\neven the Sage cannot defy these principles.\n\nThus, *\"the mysterious female, the progenitor of the valley\"* [谷神玄牝],\n*Chéng Zǐ* [程子] adopted it;\nthe teachings on *\"nurturing qi\"* [养气],\n*Zhū Zǐ* [朱子] adopted them.\nHow could our school dismiss them lightly?\nThe *Guī Shān* [圭山] *Dòng Dàoshì* [董道士]’s annotations of *Lǎo Zǐ*’s *Dào Dé Jīng* [道德经]\ngather the merits of all ancient and modern interpretations,\nto elucidate and clarify the fundamental intent.\nEven those who attach themselves to *Lǎo Zǐ*’s teachings for the sake of cultivation\nshall find distinction in their origins and sequence.\nTheir labor is profound and greatly aids the Master’s teachings;\nreaders must not overlook them.\n\n**Written in summer at the *Qián Én Píng* [前恩平] residence during the *Bǎo Yòu* [宝佑] era of *Dīng Yì* [丁巳] (corrected to *Dīng Chǔ* [丁丑] in annotation).」",

      "translated_text": "In the reign of King Zhao, observing the wondrous *zǐqì* (紫炁) drifting westward and celestial omens manifesting, he knew that a sage would soon pass through the Hangu Pass and journey west. Thus, he sought to be appointed as the Pass Warden, and the king complied.\n\nUpon arriving at the Pass, he declared:\n*\"The Yang numbers reach their peak at nine, the stars align with Metal, the year and month coincide with the king’s reign—by law, a great sage shall pass through the capital within ninety days.\"*\n\nHe first instructed the Pass officer, Sun Jing, saying:\n*\"If there be a stranger of unusual appearance, with distinctive carriage and attire, do not allow passage.\"*\n\nEmblem Xī (喜) prepared himself with fasting and purification, sweeping the road and burning incense in anticipation.\n\nAt that time, in the twenty-third year of King Zhao’s reign, on the fifth month’s *rénwǔ* (壬午) day, the Old Master, riding a green ox-drawn chariot with a thatched canopy and Xu Jia as his charioteer, set out to civilize the Western Regions.\n\nOn the twelfth day of the seventh month, *jiǎzǐ* (甲子), a venerable old man appeared—his hair snowy white, his ears long—riding a white carriage drawn by a green ox.\n\nThe officers said:\n*\"The magistrate has ordered: Kind sir, please tarry a moment.\"*\n\nThey then reported to Xī, who immediately donned his official robes and went out to greet him, bowing his head in reverence.\n\nThe Old Master declined three times, but Xī said:\n*\"Last winter, the tenth month, the Celestial Pattern Star passed west over the Pleiades. This month’s new moon saw the *róngfēng* (融风) three times, and the true *qi* of the East, like a dragon-serpent, moved westward—this is the sign of a great sage.\"*\n\nThus, he arranged for the Old Master to stay in the official guesthouse and seated him in accordance with the rites for a master-disciple relationship.\n\nXī then feigned illness and resigned his post. On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he escorted the Old Master back to his home. On the twenty-eighth day, the Old Master imparted the *Wǔqiānzi* (五千言). The following year, on the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month, he bade farewell on the southern mountain’s mound and ascended to heaven, instructing that he would be sought again after a thousand days at the Green Sheep Market.\n\nIn the twenty-seventh year, they met at the home of Li Taiguan in Shu. At that time, the celestial hosts and immortals descended from the sky, and the Old Master commanded the Five Elders and the Supreme Deities to grant Xī a jade tablet with golden inscriptions, bestowing upon him the title *Wénshǐ Xiānsheng* (文始先生) and the rank of *Wúshàng Zhēnrén* (无上真人). He was also granted a purple robe and a peony-crowned cap, and allowed to wander beyond the Eight Strings (of the celestial sphere).\n\nHe was called *Lǎozi* (老子) because he was born with white hair, and also because he cultivated the Dao and nourished his longevity.\n\nThe *Dàodéjīng* (道德经) expounds upon the principles of virtue and the Way, and may be followed perpetually.\n\nThe *Tang Yìwén Zhì* (唐艺文志) states:\n*\"During the Tianbao era, it was further titled the *Lǎozi Xuāntōng Dàodéjīng* (老子玄通道德经).\"*\n\nGe Xuan’s preface reads:\n*\"The Five Thousand Words proclaim the source of virtue and the Way, encompassing all that is great without exclusion, all that is minute without omission—it is the natural scripture of heaven and humanity.\"*\n\nBān Gù recorded the traditions of Laozi, with Fu Shi’s thirty-seven chapters, Lin Shi’s four, Xu Shi’s six, and Liu Xiang’s four.

The current claim of **5,000 characters** refers to the full count.\n\n**Péng Zhì’s** *Huáng Sòng* compilation includes commentaries by:\n- Emperor Xuānzōng’s *Zhènghé* imperial annotations,\n- Daoist **Chén Jǐngyuán**,\n- **Sīmǎ Wēngōng Guāng**,\n- **Sū Wéndìng**,\n- **Wáng Jīnggōng Ānshí**,\n- **Wáng Pán**,\n- **Lù Tiǎn**,\n- **Liú Gài**,\n- **Liú Jǐng**,\n- **Xiān Gū Cáodàochōng**,\n- **Mǎ Tíshān**,\n- **Dázhēn Zǐ**,\n- **Yīliǎo Zǐ**,\n- **Lǐ Wénchóu**,\n- **Chén Xiànggǔ**,\n- **Yè Mèngdé**,\n- **Qīngyuán Zǐ Liú Jì**,\n- **Zhū Wén Gōng Xī**,\n- **Huáng Màocái**,\n- **Chéng Wénjiǎn Gōng Dàchāng**,\n- **Lín Dōng**,\n- **Shào Ruòyú**,\n- **Ní Wénjié**,\n- **Gāo Shì Xú Zhīcháng**,\nand others—though not all are listed exhaustively.\n\nIn essence, the **Dao of Lǎozǐ** takes **cleansing, non-action, and natural spontaneity** as its core, **emptiness and clarity in responding to things without obstruction** as its application, **compassion, frugality, humility, and non-contentiousness** as its conduct, and **desirelessness, non-interference, and non-precedence over Heaven to benefit humanity** as its governance. In governing self and others, it attains the utmost.\n\nIf applied, the governance of **Tàigǔ** could be restored.\n\nThe *Records of the Han*’s *Arts and Literature Register* states:\n*\"The Daoist school holds fast to the essentials and roots, guards itself in purity and emptiness, and maintains itself in humility and weakness—this is the art of ruling as a sovereign.\"*\n\n**Ouyáng Xiū** in *Chóngwén Zǒngshū* writes:\n*\"Rooted in purity and emptiness, abandoning ambition and greed, serene and self-guarded, hence the saying: ‘I do nothing, yet the people transform; I love stillness, yet the people align.’ Even the Sage’s governance cannot surpass this.\"*\n\nGiven the times, when literary flourish prevailed and the pure, unadorned customs had vanished, **Lǎozǐ** upheld his **unadulterated Dao**, aligning with the age’s extremes. Though he responded only when moved, he could not attain office to propagate his Dao across the world. Yet he knew the **fate of the times**, yet still his teachings did not vanish—thus, he taught without distinction, and though his influence extended to the **Western lands of strange customs**, how profound was his pity for his own time and concern for posterity!\n\nFortunately, this text endured, so **Xīguān** awaited his arrival, **Dōnglǔ** beheld his dragon, and the **Book and its words** still remain.\n\nFigures like **Héshàng Zhàngrén**, **Huángshí Gōng**, **Lèchén Gōng**, and **Gài Gōng**’s disciples understood its essence and embodied it, refining its applications within themselves—thus, their world already resembled **Xīnhuáng’s** era.\n\nWhen his Dao was passed on, **Emperor Xiào** ruled by it, **Zǐfáng** assisted the **Hàn**, and **Cáo Shēn** governed **Qí**, truly reviving the **unbroken lineage** after the **tyranny of Qín**.\n\nAh! This is verified.\n\nYet if one were to surpass this—if one followed **Xīnhuáng’s** model, one would indeed achieve **Xīnhuáng’s** governance.\n\nSome see this book’s **grand and expansive words** but fail to grasp its **subtle essence of emptiness, stillness, and profound sincerity**, mistaking its **foundation for all affairs** as mere **obscure, sluggish dullness**, thus falling into **indulgent neglect**, leading to the criticism that **emptiness fails in application**. Hence, they dismiss it without examination.\n\nAlas, what a pity!\n\n**Wén Zhōngzǐ** said: *\"Prolonged emptiness led to the chaos of the Jìn—this was not Lǎozǐ’s fault.\"*\n\n**Zhū Wén Gōng** declared: *\"The Jìn officials merely used his words to justify their abandonment of ritual and law. Given their corrupt and turbulent hearts, how could they comprehend Lǎozǐ’s true intent?\"*\n\nIn the *Old Book of Tang*, **Lǐ Fān** replied: *\"Lǎozǐ’s* **Zhǐguī** *differs not from the Six Classics.\"*\n\n**Li Yào**, a **Bīngbù Láng** of the Tang, stated: *\"The world claims this book speaks of divine immortality and emptiness, yet the Six Classics are merely its branches—**Huáng-Lǎo’s** offshoots.\"*\n\nThus, **Sīmǎ Qiān** in discussing the **Great Dao** prioritized **Huáng-Lǎo** over the Six Classics—not without reason.\n\nThough the **grand principles** of this text are evident in various commentaries, some criticize its lack of **moderation**. I, a **dim-witted late learner**, presumptuously adopt and synthesize these views, adding my own insights to supplement a few gaps. Sometimes I **explicate the text**, sometimes **elaborate its intent**, appending **phonetic annotations** and **cross-referencing discrepancies**, aiming to aid comprehension. May this lead to **daily improvement**, aligning with the **Dao beyond words** in the realm of **absolute learning and carefree wisdom**.\n\nSome say **subtle teachings and hidden precepts** abound, thus the **first chapter’s \"having\" and \"not having\"** refer to the **Two Elixirs**—**spiritual qi and water-fire**. **Emptying the heart and filling the belly** signifies **refining lead**; **skilled warfare** denotes **extracting lead**.\n\nThe character **chōng** (冲), composed of **water and center**, symbolizes **true-one qi within the breath**. **Thirty spokes converge at one hub**, illustrating the **five viscera each harboring six qi**, as well as the **monthly fire符’s alignment**.\n\nSuch meanings are now omitted.\n\nSome interpret **\"not having\"** as **Earth’s Two Fire**, and **\"having\"** as **Heaven’s One Water**, thus citing the *Gǎngtōng Jué*:\n*\"Two voids submit to one existence—mysterious transformation, beyond comprehension.\"*\n\nAnd they derive the **gold-water theory** of **\"preserving white while embracing black\"**, though this pertains to **Great Elixir methods**, aligning with the **Yì’s symbols**, modeling **Heaven and Earth**, using **sun-soul and moon-shadow as medicines**—as seen in:\n- **Shénnóng’s** ancient *Lónghǔ Shàngjīng* (36 characters),\n- **Huáiyáng Wáng’s** *Jīnbì Yàozhǐ Jīng* (Western Han),\n- **Wèi Bóyáng’s** *Cāntóng Qì* (Eastern Han),\n- **Yuányáng Zǐ’s** *Jīnbì Qiántōng Jué* (Tang).\n\nThus, the methods are established.",

      "translated_text": "「As the *Hùnyuán Shílù* states: The **Dao Master** first taught **Yín Zhēn** the **Inner and Outer Two Elixirs** as safeguards, then revealed the **principles of Dao and virtue**. Thus, it is clear that **Elixir Craft** was not intermingled with the **fundamentals of this Scripture**.\n\nMoreover, the **Three-One-Nine Thoughts** (三一九思) are the essence of **inner cultivation**. The **Nine Elixirs of Golden Liquid** (九丹金液) represent the pinnacle of **external refinement**. Hence, the **Too-Qīng Scriptures** he was taught focus solely on the **external refinement of Golden Liquid**, though they differ little from the **Great Elixir methods** mentioned earlier.\n\nLater disciples, seeing the **altars, furnaces, and crucibles** (坛炉鼎灶) set up, mistakenly regarded **sacred minerals and metals** (灵砂金石) as **external elixirs**. Little did they know that **post-heaven substances** (后天) are impure and **yin-heavy** (阴杂非类), consuming them causes agitation, loss of clarity, and failure to grasp their true nature.\n\nOthers further say: **\"Not having\"** refers to **Spirit** (神), **\"having\"** to **Qi** (氣). Thus, the **interplay of presence and absence** (有无交入) is the **foundation of Elixir**, while **\"hidden and revealed\"** (隐显相符) correspond to the **interaction of Water and Gold**. **\"White within black\"** (黑中有白) signifies the **Elixir Matrix**, and the **poetic lines on the unity of the thirty-two spokes with the hub** (三十辐兮同一毂) serve as proof. Though these interpretations all borrow phrases from the Scripture to construct their own **precepts**, they form a distinct **school**, namely the **method of Inner Elixir**.\n\nAs for **Yín Zhēn’s** received **Three-One-Nine Thoughts** (三一九思), though termed **inner cultivation**, they differ fundamentally from the **Inner Elixir lineage**. In essence, **Dao, methods, and Scriptures** each have their own **purpose and scope**; one cannot exhaust all schools with a single text. If forced to merge them, such interpretations are merely **fabricated analogies**.\n\nWhy? **Nature must be self-awakened** (性由自悟), while **methods rely on transmission from a teacher** (术假师传). If these truths are indeed **concealed within profound meaning**, the adept must receive **oral instruction in meticulous detail** before doubts are dispelled. How can mere **written words** suffice?\n\nMoreover, the Scripture **proclaims the Dao of virtue and non-action**, transcending all forms, and **penetrating the subtlest cycles**. How could it accommodate such **external speculations and minor arts**?\n\n**Bái Lètiān** remarked: *\"The Five-Thousand-Word Scripture of the Primordial Emperor speaks not of medicines, not of immortals, nor of ascending to the Green Sky in White Day.\"* This is a sound observation.\n\n**Sū Wénzhōnggōng** (蘇文忠公) **Zhuó** composed the **inscription for the Chǔxiáng Palace** upon imperial command. Its general meaning is as follows:\n\nThe **Daoist tradition** originates with **Huángdì** and **Lǎozǐ**. Its **Dao** is **purity, tranquility, and non-action**; its **application** is **clarity and responsiveness**; its **conduct** is **modesty, benevolence, and non-contentiousness**. This aligns with the *Yì*’s **\"What thoughts? What contemplations?\"** and the *Lúnyǔ*’s **\"The virtuous person is tranquil and attains longevity.\"**\n\nSince the **Han Dynasty**, Daoists began incorporating **alchemists’ teachings**, introducing **arts of transcendence and transformation**, such as the **Yellow Court and Great Cavern methods**, the **titles of Wood Official and Golden Mother**, and the **veneration of Tàiyǐ and Zǐwēi**. Even **external elixir techniques, talismans, and minor arts** were all subsumed under **Daoist practice**.\n\nI have pondered this: The **Dao of Huángdì and Lǎozǐ** is the **foundation**; the **alchemists’ words** are the **branches**. Grasping the foundation naturally leads to the branches. Alas, cultivating it **for oneself**, one’s **virtue is genuine**; applying it **to the world**, one’s **virtue becomes universal**—not two distinct foundations.\n\nIf scholars truly **master the One** and **unify its principles**, then the so-called **\"profound and elusive essences\"** and **\"flickering, wondrous subtleties\"** will **manifest within the practice of guarding the Center and embracing the One** (守中抱一), while the **\"mysterious feminine\"** and **\"the use of the gourd’s latch\"** (橐钥之用) are all **works of the Dao**. Only those **deeply cultivated and self-actualized** understand this.\n\nWritten in the **twelfth month of the 11th year of Chúnyòu** (淳佑丙午腊月), by the **humble student Dòng Sījìng** of **Qīngyuán Tiānqìng Guān** (清源天庆观), at **Jūishān** (圭山).\n\n---\n**Volume One of *Dàodé Zhēnjīng Jíjiě* (道德真经集解) – Exegesis by the Humble Student Dòng Sījìng**\n\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\"*\n\nThis **precedes the entire discourse**, marking its **beginning**.\n\n**Dao** is the **comprehensive term for all principles** (万理之总名).\n**Name** is the **designation of all things** (万物之所指).\n\nYet **Dao cannot be named**—not because words are inadequate, but because **Dao must be conveyed through words**, and though **forced to name it as Dao**, it is **not the eternal Dao or name**. Thus, the **Dao that can be named** and the **name that can be named** are **not the eternal Dao and name**.\n\nThe **eternal Dao and name** are as the Scripture states: **Dao is eternal and nameless**, yet **its name persists from antiquity to the present**. **Eternal** means **naturally enduring**, without **time or place** where it does not exist.\n\n**Nameless**, the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**—this speaks of **Dao as the origin of all things under Heaven**.\n\nSince **Dao lacks any trace or sign**, none can name it. This is the **eternal Dao and name**, the **form beyond form** (形而上).\n\n**Having a name**, the **mother of all things**—this refers to **the Two Principles established**, where **all things can be named**, and **all existence arises from here**, the **form within form** (形而下).\n\n*\"Eternal non-desire, to observe its mystery\"*—this means the **Sage embodies Dao within oneself**, remaining **serene and unmoving**, while **the Spirit’s presence** is **what is stored**. Here, **Dao’s subtlest essence** is **visible**.\n\n**Eternal** is the **true, constant, and wondrous origin** (真常妙本).\nNon-desire is **stillness**—this is **Dao’s constant nature**.\nDesire is **movement**—this is **Dao’s active function**.\n\nThough **stillness and movement** are not simultaneous, **essence and function** must be **distinct**. Yet the **wondrous origin** is **profoundly settled**, **still yet ever-responsive**, **responsive yet ever-still**, never ceasing—**eternally as it is**.\n\nThus, it is called *\"eternal observation\"*—**impartial and vast**, **illuminating all stillness**.\n\n*\"Eternal desire, to observe its boundary\"*—this is the **time of response and adaptation**, where **Dao’s wondrous function** can be **observed**.\n\nThis refers to **movement’s visible aspects**, as **Zhōu Zǐ** said: *\"Stillness is nameless; movement is named.\"*\n\n**Chén Jǐngyuán** remarked: *\"The great Dao has a lesser path called the boundary.\"* These two—**nameless and named**, **mystery and boundary**—**share the same source yet differ in name**, both called **the Profound** (玄).\n\n*\"The Profound yet again profound—\nThe gateway to all wonders.\"*\n\nThis **concludes the preceding meaning**.\n\nThe two refer to **nameless and named**, **mystery and boundary**. Since **essence and function** stem from **one source**, they are **the same**.",

      "original_text": "但为之说者不能深考，如河上公以营为魂，则固非字义，而又并言人载魂魄之上以得生，当爱养之，则又失其文意。 独其载字之义，粗为得之。 若王辅嗣以载为处，以营魄为人所常居之处。 则亦河上之意。 至於近世而苏子由、王元泽之说出焉。 洪庆善亦谓阳气充魄为魂，魂能运动则其生全矣。 而且皆以载为以车承人之义矣，是不惟非其文意，且若此，则是将使神常劳动动而魄亦不得以少息。 虽幸免於物欲沉溺之累，而窈冥之中，精一之妙反为强阳所挟，以驰骛於纷拏胶扰之涂，卒以陷於众人伤生损寿之域，而不自知也。 《九歌辩证》或问魂魄之义，曰：子产有言：物生始化曰魄，既生魄阳曰魂。 孔子曰：气也者，神之威也。 魄也者，鬼之盛也。 郑氏注曰：嘘吸出入者，气也。 耳目之精明为魄。 气则魂之谓也。 《淮南子》曰：天气为魂，地气为魄。 高诱注曰：魂，人阳神也。 魄，人阴神也。 此数说者，其於魂魄之义详矣。 盖尝推之物生始化云者，谓受形之初，精血之聚，其间有灵者名之曰魄也。 既生魄阳曰魂者，既生此魄，便有暖气，其问有神者，名之曰魂也。 二者既合，然后有物。 《易》所谓精气为物者是也。 及其散也，则魂游而为神，魄降而为鬼矣。 说者乃不考此，而但据左疏之言，其以神灵分阴阳者，虽若有理，但以嘘吸之动者为魄，则失之矣。 其言附形之灵，附气之神，似亦近是，又谓魄识少而魂识多，则非也。 但有运用畜藏之异耳。 扬子云又以日月之光明论之，则固以月之体质为魄，而日之光耀为魂也。 谓日以其光加於月魄而为之明，如人登车而载於其上也。 故曰月未望，则载魄于西。 既望则终魄于东，其趋於日乎。 言月之方生，则以日之光加被於魄之西，而渐满其东，以至於望而后圆。 及既望矣，则以日之光终守其魄之东，而渐亏其西，以至於晦而后尽，盖月迩日以为明，未望则日在其右，既望则日在其左，故各向其所在而受光，如民向君之化而成 俗，此魂魄之说也。 三十辐共一毂，当其无，有车之用； 辐音福，轮中晓毂，众坚木也。 毂，古木切，乃外受众辐所会，中空受轴以为枢者。 当，丁浪切，即也。 无者，空虚处也，谓辐毂相奏以为车，即其中之虚，然后有车之用。 文公曰：无，是毂中空处。 惟其空中，故能受轴而运转不穷。 庄子所谓枢始得其环中以应无穷，亦此意也。 埏埴以为器，当其无，有器之用； 埏，始然切，和土也。 埴，市力切，粘土也。 皆陶者之事。 此亦因其器中空无，然后可以容物，乃为有用之器，下意同。 凿户牖以为室，当其无，有室之用。 凿，穿也。 半门曰户，门旁窗曰牖。 故有之以为利，无之以为用。 是三者皆於外有以成形，中虚而受物。 外有者，适时之利。 中虚者，真常之用。 非无则有无以施其利，非有则无无以致其用，是故形神相资，有无相以。 而宰形御气者常无，此所以妙化万有，而利用不穷焉。 《易》曰：乾坤毁则无以见易，易不可见，则乾坤或几乎息矣。 亦此意也。 右十一章　河上名无用。 此章明有无相资之妙用，以遣其二边取舍之惑。 五色令人目盲，五音令人耳聋，五味令人口爽， 令，并平声，使也。 爽，失也，谓失恬淡之真味。",
      "translated_text": "But those who explain it fail to delve deeply. When **Hé Shàng Gōng** takes *yíng* as the soul, this is not only incorrect in terms of the character’s meaning, but he also speaks of a person carrying the soul and spirit upon a carriage to attain life, urging their care—this is also a misinterpretation of the text’s intent. Only his understanding of the character *zài* (載) is roughly correct.\n\nIf **Wáng Fǔsì** takes *zài* to mean \"to reside,\" and regards *yíng-pò* as the place where a person habitually dwells, this is also in line with Hé Shàng’s view. Yet in later times, **Sū Shìyóu** and **Wáng Yuànzé** offered their own interpretations. **Hóng Qìngshàn** also claimed that when yang-qi fills the spirit, it becomes the soul, and if the soul can move, life is preserved. Yet all these interpretations take *zài* to mean \"to carry a person upon a carriage,\" which not only contradicts the text’s meaning but would also force the spirit to labor constantly while the soul never rests. Though one might avoid the burdens of material desires, in the depths of obscurity, the refined unity of essence would instead be seized by excessive yang, driving it through chaotic and entangled paths—ultimately falling into the realm where ordinary people harm their vitality and shorten their lives, unaware.\n\nIn *Jiǔ Gē Biànzhèng*, someone asked about the meaning of soul and spirit, and replied:\n**Zǐ Chǎn** said: *\"When a thing first takes form, it is called spirit (pò); once born, the spirit becomes yang and is called soul (hún).\"*\n**Confucius** said: *\"Qi is the manifestation of the spirit.\"*\n*\"The spirit is the essence of the ghost.\"*\n**Zhèng Xī’s commentary** states: *\"The inhaling and exhaling is qi. The clarity of the ears and eyes is the spirit. Qi is what is called the soul.\"*\n\n*The Huáinánzǐ* says: *\"Heavenly qi is the soul; earthly qi is the spirit.\"*\n**Gāo Yòu’s commentary** explains: *\"The soul is the yang-spirit of man; the spirit is the yin-spirit of man.\"*\nThese several explanations elaborate the meaning of soul and spirit well.\n\nIndeed, when it says *\"a thing first takes form\"* (物生始化), it means that at the moment of receiving form, when vital essence and blood gather, the luminous aspect among them is called *spirit*. When it says *\"once born, the spirit becomes yang and is called soul\"* (既生魄阳曰魂), it means that once the spirit is born, there arises a warm vitality, and the divine aspect among them is called *soul*. Only when these two unite does a thing come into being—this is what the *Yì* means by *\"refined qi forms things.\"*\n\nWhen they disperse, the soul wanders as spirit, and the spirit descends as ghost. Yet those who explain it do not consider this, and merely rely on **Zuǒ Zhū’s commentary**, which divides the divine and luminous into yin and yang. Though this seems reasonable, to take the inhaling and exhaling as the spirit is incorrect. His statement that *\"the luminous attached to form is the spirit, the divine attached to qi is the soul\"* is closer to the truth, but his claim that *\"the spirit’s cognition is limited while the soul’s cognition is vast\"* is wrong. They merely differ in their functions of movement and storage.\n\n**Yáng Zhīzhōng** further explains this through the luminosity of the sun and moon, asserting that the moon’s substance is the spirit, while the sun’s radiance is the soul. He says the sun’s light illuminates the moon’s spirit, just as a person ascends a carriage and rides upon it. Hence, *\"when the moon is not yet full, the spirit is carried westward.\"* When full, *\"the spirit terminates eastward,\"* tending toward the sun. This means that when the moon is waxing, the sun’s light shines upon the spirit’s western side, gradually filling its eastern side until it reaches fullness. Once full, the sun’s light guards the spirit’s eastern side, gradually diminishing its western side until it wanes and vanishes. The moon’s brilliance depends on its proximity to the sun—before fullness, the sun is to its right; after fullness, to its left. Thus, it faces whichever direction the light comes from, like the people turning toward their ruler’s transformation to form customs. This is the doctrine of soul and spirit.\n\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at one hub; though the hub is empty, it fulfills the carriage’s use.\"*\n**Fú** (輻) is pronounced *fú*, and **gǔ** (毂) is the hollow center of the wheel, made of many hard woods. **Gǔ** is pronounced *gǔ* (古木切), meaning the outer part where all spokes meet, hollow inside to receive the axle as its pivot. **Dāng** (當) is pronounced *dāng* (丁浪切), meaning \"just so.\" The \"empty\" refers to the hollow space, meaning that the spokes and hub combine to form a carriage, and it is this central void that makes the carriage functional. **Wén Gōng** said: *\"The empty is the hollow within the hub.\"* Only because it is empty within can it receive the axle and turn endlessly. This is what **Zhuāngzǐ** meant when he said: *\"The pivot begins to find its circular center, responding to the boundless.\"*\n\n*\"Mixing clay to make a vessel: though it is empty, it fulfills the vessel’s use.\"*\n**Suō** (埏) is pronounced *suō* (始然切), meaning \"to blend earth,\" and **zhí** (埴) is pronounced *zhí* (市力切), meaning \"sticky clay\"—both are the work of potters. This too relies on the vessel’s inner emptiness to contain things, making it a useful vessel. The meaning below is the same.\n\n*\"Piercing doors and windows to make a room: though it is empty, it fulfills the room’s use.\"*\n**Záo** (凿) means \"to bore.\" A half-door is called *hù* (户), and a window beside the door is called *yǒu* (牖). Thus, what is \"having\" is for convenience, while what is \"empty\" is for function. These three things all have outer forms to take shape, yet are hollow within to receive things. The outer form brings timely benefit, while the inner emptiness holds true, constant use. Without the empty, there would be no way to apply its benefit; without the having, there would be no way to achieve its function. Thus, form and spirit rely on each other, and having and emptiness complement one another. Yet the one who governs form and directs qi is always in the empty—this is how wondrous transformations arise, and utility is endless.\n\nThe *Yì* says: *\"If the Heaven and Earth were destroyed, there would be no way to see the *Yì*; if the *Yì* were unseen, Heaven and Earth might nearly cease to exist.\"* This conveys the same meaning.\n\n**Eleven chapters have been discussed.**\n**Hé Shàng** named this chapter *\"The Use of the Non-Use.\"*\n\nThis chapter elucidates the wondrous interplay of having and emptiness, dispelling the confusion of one-sided extremes.\n\nFive colors make the eyes blind;\nFive tones make the ears deaf;\nFive flavors make the palate lose its true taste.\n**Lìng** (令) is pronounced *lìng* (令, all level tones), meaning \"to cause.\"\n**Shuǎng** (爽) means \"to lose,\" referring to the loss of the genuine, unadulterated taste.",

      "translated_text": "Hunting and galloping across fields drive one’s mind to madness—\nthis is when *qi* reverses and agitates the heart.\nThough the will may move *qi* nineteen times out of twenty,\nthis chapter speaks of all that which, coming from without, bewilders us.\nThus it instructs us to master the external so as to tranquilize the inner.\n\nRare and coveted goods disrupt one’s conduct.\n*\"Conduct\"* is pronounced *xíng* (行, departing tone).\nRare and coveted goods are all external things.\n*\"Disrupt\"* means to harm.\nWhen the heart clings to externals, it obstructs virtuous conduct.\nTherefore, the Sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes,\nand thus discards the former to embrace the latter.\n*\"Discards\"* (去), pronounced *qù* (mouth-ju, to scatter), here means to remove—\nnot the *qù* (去) of departure.\nThe belly contains within yet desires nothing;\nthe eyes chase what appears without and lure the inner.\nTo act for the belly is akin to the *Gèn* (艮) meaning of \"ease and retreat\";\nnot to act for the eyes aligns with the *Yīnfú* (阴符) saying, *\"The mechanism lies in the eyes.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\n*Hé Shàng* named this *\"Frugality in Desire.\"*\nThis chapter clarifies how attachment to dust and pursuit of phenomena\nall lead one astray from the true Way.\nFor the previous chapter spoke of the boundless wonders of emptiness within,\nhere it warns against being filled by external evils.\nIts essence lies in the eyes—\nthus it begins and ends with them,\nas with the six senses and six dusts, where *eye-color* ranks first.\nThe Master’s *\"Four Do Nots\"* (四勿) must first say *\"Do not gaze\"*—\nall of this meaning is the same.\n\nYet the eyes must see, the ears must hear,\nthe mouth must taste, the form must labor,\nthe heart must respond—\nthese cannot be stilled.\nOnly when movement never departs from stillness\ndoes one, though moving, not cling to things,\nand thus attain serene desirelessness.\n\nHonor and disgrace strike like alarms;\nwealth and great calamity press like the body itself.\nTo gain honor is disgrace;\nhonor is the root of disgrace—\nonly after honor does disgrace arise,\nhence it is called *\"the lesser.\"*\nTo receive it is like an alarm;\nto lose it is like an alarm—\nthis is called *\"honor and disgrace striking like alarms.\"*\nIf not aligned with the Way,\nthen gain and loss burden the heart like bells,\nand thus one is alarmed.\n\nWhat is meant by *\"wealth and great calamity press like the body itself\"*?\nThe reason I have great calamity is that I have a body.\nWhen I have no body, what calamity do I have?\n*\"For\"* is pronounced *wèi* (去, departing tone).\nThis again speaks of the body as the root of wealth and calamity—\nwithout a body, one forgets the self.\nThe previous did not reach disgrace,\nthis did not reach wealth—\nit is mutual phrasing to convey the meaning,\nand since no one fails to love wealth or hate calamity,\nit speaks only of calamity.\nThis stems from the persistence of the *self-view*;\nif one could abandon the self,\nthen naturally wealthy one walks in wealth,\nnaturally afflicted one endures affliction—\nsmooth and rugged are as one,\npleasure and pain are equal—\nthen who would further bear wealth or calamity?\n\nThus, to hold wealth as the body is to entrust it with the world;\nto love the body as the world is to commit the world to it.\nGuó Xiàng says:\n*\"If one lightly discards the body to pursue gain,\nabandons the self to serve things,\nthen the body itself cannot be secure—\nhow much less the world?\"*\nIt means one must truly cherish and love the body\nbefore one can be entrusted with the world.\nYet wealth does not reach the depth of love,\nand entrustment does not last as long as commitment.\nSome say: *\"To know how to cherish and love the body\nis to transcend the world.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\n*Hé Shàng* named this *\"Loathing Shame.\"*\nThis chapter clarifies how to discard false emotions\nand restore the true nature.\nIf one abandons honor, disgrace does not reach;\nif one forgets the body, calamity does not come.\nThe world is a great thing—\nyet even it is not a burden,\nhow much less other things?\nBut to forget the body is the study of the transcendent.\nOne who cherishes and loves the body\nyet does not let the world be a burden\nis not one bound by the *Huánghù* (yellow-roofed palace).\n\nWhat is unseen when gazed upon is called *yí* (夷);\nthe great symbol is level and smooth, without visible color.\nWhat is unheard when listened to is called *xī* (希);\nthe great sound is subtle and silent, beyond hearing.\nWhat cannot be grasped is called *wēi* (微).\n*\"Grasp\"* is pronounced *bó* (伯各).\nSubtle and formless, it is empty and cannot be held.\nThese three cannot be forced or questioned,\nso they merge into one.\n\n*\"Question\"* is pronounced *jié* (契吉).\nThe Dao is not reachable by sight, hearing, wisdom, or strength—\nit must be returned to unity before it can be attained.\nAbove, it is not bright;\nbelow, it is not dim.\n*\"Bright\"* is pronounced *jiǎo* (古晓).\nIt means that though above it does not add clarity,\nand though below it does not add obscurity,\nit is taut yet nameless,\nreturning to nothingness.\nThough taut like a cord, unbroken in motion,\nit is truly without substance to name.\n\nThis is called the *form of no-form*,\nthe *symbol of no-symbol*—\nthis is called *huǎnghǔ* (恍惚).\nWén Dìng says:\n*\"Form\"* refers to its manifestation,\n*\"symbol\"* to its subtlety.\nSince it is neither having nor not-having,\nand having and not-having cannot be fixed in name,\nit is called *huǎnghǔ*.\n\nApproach it and you see no head;\nfollow it and you see no tail.\nOnly because it lacks form and color yet flows boundlessly without end\nis it impossible to grasp or follow.\n\nTo hold the ancient Dao\nand govern the present *you* (有),\nto know the ancient beginning\nis called the *memorial of the Way*.\nTime has ancient and present,\nthe Dao has no end or beginning.\nThe Sage teaches people to embody the Dao\nto govern the body and master things—\nthat is, to take the *you* of things\nand trace it back to its original *wu* (无),\nthus grasping its root and unifying its lineage.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\n*Hé Shàng* named this *\"Praising the Mysterious.\"*\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao’s supreme subtlety thus:\nIf one hears without sound emerging,\nsees without transcending color,\nthen unless one is deluded and clinging to things,\none must abandon *you* and cling to *wu*.\nThus it repeatedly elucidates the meaning of neither approaching nor departing,\nurging one to delve deeply and attain it oneself.\n\nThe virtuous scholars of antiquity\nwere subtle, mysterious, and profound—\ndeep beyond recognition.\nWén Dìng says:\n*\"Coarse exhaustion leads to subtlety,\nsubtlety to profundity,\nprofundity to mystery,\nmystery then flows through all without measure.\"*",

meant to say the Dao is also one thing within the realm—\nscholars must not let the words obscure the meaning.\nThe phrase *\"and the Sage occupies one of them\"* means:\nMan is the heart of Heaven and Earth,\nuniting with the Dao,\nto conceal Heaven within Heaven,\nand Earth within Earth.\nAmong all things, the most refined and luminous is Man,\nand the Sage governs them.\nMan follows Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows *zìrán*.\n*Follow*—the meaning of mutual dependence.\nThus, in order:\nMan dwells within Earth,\ntaking form and receiving

of *small*.\n\nAll things move and interact yet none can perceive its measure,\nso it expands boundlessly yet lacks form to be grasped,\nthe utmost of *great*.\n\nThis is why the Dao is *vast*—\nit may be encountered on all sides.\n\nHence, the Sage never claims greatness,\nand thus is able to fulfill it.\nIf one claims greatness, it becomes *small*—\nonly the Supreme Sage merges with the Dao,\nand thus attains greatness.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\n*River-Upper* names it *Achievement* (*Rén Dé*).\n\nThis chapter states that those who perfect the radiant virtue\nall derive it from following the Dao.\n\nTo hold the *Great Image* (*Dà Xiàng*), all under Heaven will come.\nComing yet causing no harm,\nthey are secure, tranquil, and at ease.\n\nThe *Image without image* (*wú xiàng zhī xiàng*)—\nthus it is called the *Great Image*.\nTo *hold* (*zhí*) is to embody it without contradiction.\n\nThe Dao is the mother of all things;\nthings come and attach to virtue,\nlike children returning to their mother.\n\nTo *come* (*wǎng*) is to *return* (*guī*).\nYet when the multitude returns,\nif one harbors a sense of self,\nharm will ensue.\n\nOnly the Supreme Sage empties himself to preserve sincerity,\nbenefiting yet causing no harm,\nso neither he nor others are injured,\nand his heart remains tranquil, peaceful, and at ease.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*The Sage interacts with things without harming them,\nand if he does not harm them,\nthings cannot harm him either.*\nOnly he who harms nothing\ncan truly meet others with mutual accord—\nthis is the same meaning.\n\n*Music and bait* (pleasures and inducements),\n*passing guests* (fleeting influences) may halt.\nThe Dao’s utterance is bland—\nwithout flavor to taste,\nunseen when viewed,\ninaudible when heard,\nits use never exhausted.\n\n*Music* (pleasures) and *bait* (inducements) are *Yue* (ear-pleasing).\n*Out* (utterance, *chū*)—with a falling tone.\n*Bland* (*dàn*)—read as *tú zàn*.\nIt refers to those who do not grasp the *Great Image*\nand are confined to a narrow, one-sided Dao,\nlike the loss of hearing to melodious tones,\nor the fleeting delight of cattle and horses in food.\n\nThough *passing guests* (fleeting influences) may linger for a moment,\ntheir power is ultimately finite—\nthen they will depart, leaving behind.\n\nZhuangzi metaphorically speaks of stopping at the *Qiaolu* (a humble dwelling)\nfor one night—\nthis is the same intent.\n\nYet the *Great Dao*,\nthough profound and without form, sound, or scent,\nits efficacy is boundless.\n\n*Exhausted* (*jì*)—to *finish* (*jìn*).\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Five**\n*River-Upper* names it *Virtue and Benevolence* (*Rén Dé*).\n\nThis chapter illustrates the boundless effects of embodying the Dao.\n\nTo *gather* (*xī*), one must first *expand* (*zhāng*);\nTo *weaken* (*ruò*), one must first *strengthen* (*qiáng*);\nTo *abandon* (*fèi*), one must first *flourish* (*xīng*);\nTo *take away* (*duó*), one must first *bestow* (*yǔ*).\n\nThis is called *Subtle Clarity* (*Wēi Míng*).\n\nWhen *expansion* reaches its limit, it must *gather*;\nWhen *bestowal* is excessive, it must *take away*—\nthis is the inevitable principle.\n\nWhat is called *\"must first\"* (*bì gù*)\nis like saying:\nWhen things are about to *gather*,\nthey were originally *expanded*—\nthen *gathering* follows naturally.\nThis is the principle of *ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness* (*xiāo xì yíng xū*).\n\nThough its mechanism is subtle and hidden,\nthe principle is clear and evident—\nonly those who dwell in *clarity and stillness, gentleness and weakness*\ndo not fall into its trap.\n\n*Gentleness* overcomes *rigidity*,\n*weakness* overcomes *strength*.\nOnly by residing in *gentleness and weakness*\ndoes one lack the intent to overcome,\nand the principle naturally aligns—\nthis is the teaching of *Returning to the Root* (*Shǒu Fù*).\n\nIf one is *rigid and strong*,\nit means they have already overreached—\n*decay* will inevitably follow.\n\n*A fish cannot be plucked from the depths*—\nThe state’s *sharp tools* (tools of power),\ncannot be displayed to the people.\n\nFor the one who embraces the Dao within himself\nand withdraws to conceal it in secrecy.\n\n*Sharp tools* are those that control entry and exit,\nwhich all people rely on,\nyet the ruler who holds their mechanism\nuses them to govern others.\n\nNot only should they not be displayed to the people,\nbut they cannot even be *obtained* to display to others.\nThis is what the *Yinfu* (a Daoist text) refers to as *stealing the mechanism*.\n\nThe people can be made to follow,\nbut cannot be made to know.\n\nWen Ding said:\n*The fish, as a creature, has no claws or teeth\nto overpower others.*\nYet when it rests in the depths,\neven the strongest cannot seize it—\nbut once it leaves the depths,\nthen people can capture and control it.\n\nThe Sage alone dwells in *gentleness and weakness* without satiety,\nthus he can ultimately subdue all under Heaven—\nthis is not something shared with the common people.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Six**\n*River-Upper* names it *Subtle Clarity* (*Wēi Míng*).\n\nThis chapter demonstrates that the principle of *ebbing and flowing, fullness and emptiness*\nis constant,\nwhile those who cling to *gentleness and weakness*\ndo not understand its mechanism.\n\nThe Dao acts without action,\nyet nothing remains undone.\nSilent and unmoving,\nall principles are complete,\nresponding when touched,\nleaving no matter unattended.\n\nIf sovereigns and kings could preserve this,\nall things would naturally transform.\n\nWhen transformation is complete and they wish to act,\nI would restrain them with the *Unnamed Root* (*wú míng zhī pǔ*).\n\nTo always embody the *Supreme Dao*,\nthen one need not teach—\ntransformation will occur naturally.\n\nYet time will bring change,\nlike the infant’s hair turning into knowledge—\nthen one must again restrain with *non-desire*.\n\n*Non-desire* leads to *stillness*,\nwhich is the complete embodiment of the Dao—\ntruly the *Unnamed Root*.\n\nThe *Unnamed Root* will also not desire,\n*non-desire* brings *stillness*,\nand all under Heaven will naturally align.\n\nIf one harbors a *desiring Root* (*yù pǔ*) in his heart,\nhe will lose its complete embodiment.\n\nThis is to exhaust one’s nature to reach one’s destiny,\nto be great and capable of transformation.\n\nSuch *true stillness* (*zhēn jìng*)\nis why all things under Heaven\nare naturally transformed,\neach preserving its innate nature and destiny.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven**\n*River-Upper* names it *Governance* (*Wéi Zhèng*).\n\nThis chapter reveals how embodying the Dao can transform,\nand how it also encompasses\nforgetting

righteousness is lost, only then does ritual take form.\n\nThe Dao is an undifferentiated whole,\nshared by Heaven, Earth, and all things.\n\nHuman nature embodies principle,\nand when this principle is realized within oneself—\nwithout reliance on the external—\nit is called *virtue*.\n\nInitially, there is no virtue separate from the Dao,\nbut once named as *virtue*,\nit is divided into ranks and distinctions,\nunlike the Dao’s all-encompassing embrace.\nThus, when virtue is not fully realized,\nthe complete body is still the Dao.\n\nIf one clings to virtue as possession,\nthen lower virtue fails to transform,\nand the Dao’s wholeness is lost—\nhence, *\"When the Dao is lost, only then does virtue arise.\"*\n\nThe *Guan Yin Zi* says:\n*\"What can be named is called virtue, not Dao.\"*\n\nWhen the name of virtue is prominent,\nthe name of the Dao fades.\nWhen the name of humanity is prominent,\nthe name of virtue fades.\nThe more one pursues, the lower one descends,\nand the more one values, the more one strays.\n\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The Dao is hidden in small achievements.\"*\nTruly so.\n\nRitual is the thinning of loyalty and sincerity,\nand the beginning of chaos.\nWhen ritual’s excesses reach their peak,\nits essence is diluted,\nand its later stages become the source of disorder.\nThis is why Confucius sought guidance from those ahead of him.\n\nPreconceived knowledge is the ornament of the Dao,\nand the origin of folly.\nThis is the work of those who wield intelligence—\nto force understanding through cleverness,\nor to guess and occasionally succeed,\nyet never truly comprehend.\nThis only obscures one’s natural clarity,\nmaking it the beginning of folly.\n\nAs *Mencius* says:\n*\"What I dislike in intelligence is its rigidity.\"*\n\nWhen obscured by superficial adornment,\none cannot preserve the purity of the Great Dao—\nwhat else could it be but folly?\n\nThus, the true gentleman\nhas lofty vision beyond the world,\nyet does not conform to its trends.\nHe dwells in substance, not in superficiality,\nin reality, not in ornament—\nand so he discards the latter for the former.\n\n*\"Dwelling\"* and *\"discarding\"* are both read with the rising tone.\nWhy not return to the original?\n\nWen Ding says:\n*\"People’s sight stops at the eyes,\ntheir hearing at the ears,\ntheir thoughts at the mind—\nthus they delight in what they grasp below\nand lose sight of what is above.\nThey favor the shallow and neglect the profound,\npursue ornament and abandon substance.\nWithout the true gentleman’s resolve,\nwho could discard the one for the other?\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Riverbank Discourse on Virtue**\nThis chapter clarifies complete virtue and encourages a return to simplicity.\n\nSomeone asked:\n*\"Do the Five Constants of morality and virtue have distinctions?\nOr are they undifferentiated?\nHow do their applications differ?\"*\n\nThe reply:\n*\"How could they be undifferentiated?\nThe Dao encompasses the whole,\nwhile virtue arises from the measure of one’s capacity within oneself.\nThe Dao is like the undifferentiated primordial *qi*,\nvirtue is like the names given to seasons and times,\nand humanity, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom\nare like the designations of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\nWhen all four are fully realized,\nit is called a year.\nWhen humanity is at its peak,\nit is spring;\nwhen ritual is at its peak,\nit is summer;\nwhen righteousness is at its peak,\nit is autumn;\nwhen wisdom is at its peak,\nit is winter—\neach attaining its true essence.\nThus, every eighteen days of the season’s soil phase\ncorresponds to this principle.\n\nThere is humanity within righteousness,\nso life contains death;\nthere is righteousness within humanity,\nso death contains life—\nas when willows wither in February\nyet wheat sprouts in August.\n\nThe same applies to the world.\n\nThe *Huang Ji Jing Shi Shu* says:\nThe Three Sovereigns governed the world through the Dao,\nthe Five Emperors through virtue,\nthe Three Kings through merit,\nand the Five Hegemons through force.\nThe Three Sovereigns shared humanity but differed in transformation,\nthe Five Emperors shared ritual but differed in teaching,\nthe Three Kings shared righteousness but differed in exhortation,\nthe Five Hegemons shared wisdom but differed in leadership.\n\nThus, the age of the Three Sovereigns was like spring,\nthe age of the Five Emperors like summer,\nthe age of the Three Kings like autumn,\nand the age of the Five Hegemons like winter.\n\nWhen Laozi met Guan Yin,\nit was at the juncture of autumn and winter—\nperhaps he sought to transform the world\nwith the steadfast Dao\nand restore it to spring.\n\nSomeone asked:\n*\"Why do their sequences differ?\"*\n\nThe reply:\n*\"Governance involves both adaptation and revolution.\nThus, the order follows what is natural,\nbut this chapter addresses the excesses of named distinctions,\nso it advocates complete revolution.\n\nAs the *Book of Transformation* says:\nWhen humanity is insufficient, righteousness supplements it—\nmetal subdues wood;\nwhen righteousness is insufficient, ritual supplements it—\nfire subdues metal;\nwhen ritual is insufficient, wisdom supplements it—\nwater subdues fire;\nwhen wisdom is insufficient, trust supplements it—\nearth subdues water.\n\nThus, dwelling in substance and profundity\nis the true essence of trust—\nthe beginning that is the end,\nand the end that is the beginning.\n\nGuo De Yuan once asked Zhu Wen Gong:\n*\"Laozi says ritual is the thinning of loyalty and sincerity,\nand the origin of chaos.\nYet Confucius also sought guidance on ritual from others.\nWhy is this?\"*\n\nWen Gong replied:\n*\"Laozi understood the complexities of ritual,\nfor he had once served as the Palace Archivist,\nand thus grasped its intricacies—\nthat is why he spoke so well with Confucius.\nBut he also said ritual could be dispensed with,\nas if the Sage’s use of it seemed burdensome,\nwhich is why he spoke thus.\nAs in the *Ritual of Music*, where it says\n*'Planning leads to action, and war arises from this,'*\nthere lies this very meaning.\n\nIn ancient times, those who attained Oneness—\nHeaven attained Oneness and became clear,\nEarth attained Oneness and became tranquil,\nthe Spirit attained Oneness and became responsive,\nthe grains attained Oneness and became abundant,\nall things attained Oneness and flourished,\nand the feudal lords attained Oneness to govern the world with integrity—\nthis is the effect of Oneness.\n\nThe One is the Dao,\nwhich has always existed—\nhence, it is called *ancient*.\n\nAll things possess it yet the Dao remains unchanged—\nthus, it is called One.\nHeaven’s clarity, Earth’s tranquility,\nthe Spirit’s responsiveness,\nthe grains’ abundance,\nall things’ flourishing,\nand the lords’ integrity—\neach fulfills its natural function\nthrough the power of the One.\"*",
      "overlap_context": ", it resorts to bared arms,\nand its excesses become unbearable.\n\nLaozi lived in an age of extreme formalism,\nand thus speaks of it with particular urgency—\nhe wished to transform the people through the natural Way of non-action.\n\nThese three are spoken of as **\"Highest\"**\nbecause those below are unworthy of mention.\n\n*\"Bared arms\"* means rolling up one’s sleeves to bare the arms.\n*\"Rem\"* means *\"to follow\"*—\nWen Gong says: *\"Rem\"* means *\"to draw\"*—\nthe character may also be written as *\"rēng.\"*",

generously bestows upon all things,\ncompleting its boundless, selfless wholeness.\n\nThus the ancient scholars cultivated for themselves\nyet ultimately achieved success for all—\nthis is embodying the Way.\n\nThe Way gives birth to One,\nOne generates Two,\nTwo generates Three,\nThree generates all things.\nMaster Zhu Wen (朱文公) said:\n*The Way is the *Taiji* of the *Yijing*,\nOne is the oddness of Yang,\nTwo is the pairing of Yin,\nThree is the accumulation of odd and paired.\nWhen it says \"Two generates Three,\"\nit means Two and One make Three.\nWhen it says \"Three generates all things,\"\nit means the union of odd and paired gives birth to all things.\nIf one simply takes One as the *Taiji*,\nthen it cannot be said that the Way generates One—\nthis aligns with Liezi’s claim that the *Yijing* transforms into One.\nThe so-called \"One\" is merely the beginning of transformation,\nnot the abstract number One.\n\nAll things carry Yin on their backs and embrace Yang,\ntheir vital breath harmonized.\nFor living beings,\ntheir backs face rearward—Yin’s stillness—\nwhile mouths, noses, ears, and eyes face forward—Yang’s activity,\nthus \"carry Yin and embrace Yang.\"\nAs

\"embracing,\"\nsubstance manifests externally as \"carrying.\"\nQi moves as dynamic Yang and stasis Yin,\nbalanced by central harmony,\nfilling form and substance,\nthe mechanism upon which the spirit rides.\nMaster Wen (温公) said:\nAll things take Yin and Yang as their essence,\nand central harmony as their function.\nMaster Wenjian (文简) said:\nWhen Yin and Yang qi are imbalanced,\nor when they intermingle and harmonize,\nthis is the exchange of Two to form Three,\nthe pervasion of Three to form all things.\n\nWhat people detest—\nthe lonely, the orphaned, the childless—\nthe king and duke hold as virtues.\nThus things may be diminished yet benefit,\nor benefited yet diminished.\n*\"Evil\"* (恶), pronounced *wù*—\nMaster Wen said:\n*\"Fullness invites loss, humility invites gain.\"*\nThis is to avoid extremes and approach central harmony.\n\nWhat people teach,\nI also teach with my *Yi*.\nThe tyrannical meet no good end—\nI will take them as my teaching fathers.\n*\"Strong\"* (强), pronounced *qiáng*.\nIf one knows the principle of diminishing and benefiting thus,\nthen all teaching should follow my *Kun* and harmonious *Yi*—\nknowing the tyrannical reach their extreme\nyet still meet no good end.\nThis is especially so—\nthus I say, *\"I will take them as my teaching fathers.\"*\n*\"Father\"* (父) is the root.\nThough teaching is the master’s way,\nmasters are honored yet distant,\nwhile fathers are honored and intimate—\nthus there is no hidden meaning.\nAs the *Yijing* says:\n*\"Without a teacher or guardian,\nit is as if facing one’s parents.\"*\nThis is the same intent.\nNow, speaking specifically of *\"father\"*\nemphasizes the severity of teaching.\n---\n**Forty-second Chapter** (*Riverbank* on *Dao’s Transformation*)\nThis

      "translated_text": "---\n\nThe response to *\"why is it so?\"* lies in the depth of its **generative vitality (生生)**—\nthis is the answer’s phrasing.\n\nIt means that though one seeks to thicken life’s abundance, they cannot forget the self,\nand thus are driven by delusion into the realm of death.\n\nFor those drowned in the pursuit of life must inevitably meet death as its counterpart,\nwhile those who dwell beyond life and death—where no duality exists—\nremain oblivious, hence the *Classic* says:\n*\"Only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\"*\n\nSome say delusive thoughts proliferate endlessly—\nthis too is the extreme of **generative vitality (生生)**—\nand it is also acceptable.\n\nIf one can cultivate stillness to nourish **pure clarity (虚明)**,\nthen movement never departs from stillness,\nand movement and stillness are both forgotten—\nthis is the conduct of those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**.\n\nAs **Wen Ding** says:\n*\"The followers of life and death, each occupying three parts of ten,\ndo they not amount to nine parts of life and death,\nwhile the **Dao of neither life nor death** stands alone?\"*\n\nNeither life nor death is what the *Yijing* calls **\"serene and unmoving.\"**\nLaozi speaks of the nine but omits the one,\nleaving it to the seeker to realize,\nand thus entrusts the subtlety of **non-thinking, non-action (无思无为)**.\n\nIt is said that those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**\nwalk on land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,\nenter battlefields without bearing armor.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger no place to strike with its claws,\nthe blade no place to find its edge.\n\n*Why is this?*\nBecause there is no realm of death.\n*\"Rhinoceros\"* sounds similar.\nThe *Shan Hai Jing* says:\n*\"The rhinoceros emerges from the southern banks of the Xiang River,\nwith a blackish hue.\"*\nThe *Er Ya* says:\n*\"Its form resembles a wild ox, yet it has but one horn.\"*\nThis is the language of modesty—\none does not dare speak of oneself.\n\nWhen the **returning flow is whole and unified (反流全一)**,\nwhen the gathered thoughts dissolve into **non-being (归无)**,\nthis is the conduct of those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**—\nas **Guan Yin** said: *\"Forgetting vitality and transcending life.\"*\n\nThus, even the *one* is not established,\nand so their **heavenly defense (天守)** remains intact,\ntheir **spirit (神)** unassailable,\nand nothing can enter them of its own accord.\nThus numbers cannot constrain them,\ncalamities cannot reach them,\nand even the realm of life is absent—\nhow could there be a realm of death?\n\nHence it is said: *\"The Perfect One has no self,\nand aligns with the Dao in unity.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty**\nNamed *\"Noble Life\"* by **He Shang**\n\nThis chapter clarifies that those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**\ntake **non-action (无为)** as their ultimate principle,\nthus able to evade calamities and transcend life and death.\n\nYet interpretations vary:\n**He Shang Gong**, **Han Fei**, **Bi Xu Zi**, **Ye Mengde**, and **Lin Dong**\nall take the **four limbs and nine orifices** as thirteen,\nwith movement and stillness belonging to life and death.\nThe ignorant harm themselves through reckless action,\nand movement aligns with evil, leading to the realm of death.\n\nIf so, then the followers of death and the realm of death’s movement\nare indistinguishable—\nwhat more can be said of mere form?\n\n**Du Guangcheng** takes the **ten evils and three actions** as thirteen,\nand there are also those who speak of **seven emotions and six desires**.\n\n**Li Wenchou** says:\n*\"The kidneys are **Kan (坎)**, the gate of life.\nThe heart is **Li (离)**, the door of death.\"*\nEach completes a cycle of twelve branches,\nwaning and renewing—\nthis makes thirteen,\nyet it omits the thirteen of the realm of death’s movement.\n\nThe **Kaiyuan Commentary**, **Sun Deng**, **Sima**, **Shao**, **Wang**, and **Cao**\nall say:\n*\"Among ten people, three belong to each category—\nroughly, those who preserve life through gentleness occupy three of ten,\nthose who hasten death through rigidity occupy three of ten,\nand those who, though loving life, inevitably trend toward death also occupy three of ten.\"*\n\n**Cao** says:\n*\"Those who cultivate longevity are followers of life,\nthose who cultivate quiescence are followers of death,\nand those who indulge in desires and reckless action\nall trend toward the realm of death.\"*\n\n**Shu Zhao Shi** further takes the **five-phase life-death numerology** as thirteen,\nusing the following method:\n*Jia-Ji-Zi-Wu* nine, *Yi-Geng-Chou-Wei* eight,\n*Heng-Xin-Yin-Shen* seven, *Ding-Wen-Mao-You* six,\n*Si-Hai* alone stands at four—\nthis sums to thirteen.\nFor example: water is born in *Shen* (seven), dies in *Mao* (six),\ntotaling thirteen.\nThis can be extended similarly—\nthus the *Classic* should say *\"the thirteen followers of life and death\"* instead.\n\n**Huang Ri** says:\n*\"Water’s complete number is six,\nfire’s complete number is seven—\ntogether, thirteen.\"*\nThough many recent commentaries adopt this,\nwho can say such hasty compilation must be so?\nMoreover, why single out two of the five phases,\nand why discard the life-generating numbers while taking only the complete numbers?\nWhat is the meaning of this?\n\nThere are also those who say:\n*\"From the kidneys’ water rising into the heart,\nthis is the birth-and-death cycle.\"*\nThey even cite **Zhang Pingzhu’s** poem:\n*\"Thirteen wrapped in yin, six and seven in yang\"*\nas proof.\n\nSo-called **life-nurturing (摄生)** is thus taking **Kan’s substance**\nto punctuate **Li’s void**—\nuntil, in the absence of death’s realm,\none transforms into the **Great Receptive (乾)**.\n\nTheir theory seems plausible yet strays from the *Classic’s* intent.\n\n**Wen Ding** says:\n*\"Those who use things to extract essence for self-nourishment\nare followers of life.\nThose who indulge in sounds, colors, odors, and flavors\nharm themselves—these are followers of death.\"*\nHaving thus divided the paths of life and death,\nI also know deceit yet fail to know stillness,\nknow speech yet fail to know silence,\nknow thought yet fail to know forgetting—\nand thus rush toward exhaustion.\nThis is what is called the **realm of death’s movement**.\n\nYet **Qing Yuan Zi’s** view is similar—\nbut the followers of death and the realm of death’s movement\nare indistinct.\nThis is why I alone clarify that **qi’s extension and contraction**\nare the followers of life and death,\nwhile **entering into use** is the realm of death’s movement.\n\nFor the **Dao of Immortality** values life,\nand thus cherishes the **yang qi of generation**—\nhow much more so the **Heavenly Dao**?\n\nThe **Dao of Ghosts** values termination,\nand thus clings to the **yin qi of decay**—\ndeath on earth.\n\nThe **Human Dao** values the **heart-mind (#1)**,\nand thus can both live and die—\nfor **qi in use** is moderate and balanced—\nhow much more so for humanity?\n\nAs for the **one of neither life nor death**,\nit is not numbered yet numbers flow through it,\nnot used yet use is accomplished—\nthis is the **embodiment of the Dao (尸乎道)**.\n\nThis is how it circulates beyond the three,\nyet is not confined by them.",

Virtue’s nobility—\nnone can bestow them, yet they abide **naturally and eternally**.\n\nThe Dao is the **Mother of all things**,\nwhile Virtue is the Dao **embodied within us**.\n\nIn Heaven and Earth, it is **Heaven and Earth’s Virtue**;\nin the Sage, it is the **Sage’s Virtue**.\n\nThe Dao is the **origin of perpetual generation**,\nwhile Virtue **tends to the multitude without arrogance**.\n\nWithout Virtue, all things cannot fulfill their **destiny**—\nhence it is called **nurturing**.\n\n**Form** is but the **manifestation of Dao and Virtue**,\nwhile **Momentum (#2)** is the **interdependent principle** by which all things arise.\n\nThus, how could one fail to **venerate the root**?\nHence all revere the Dao and honor Virtue.\n\nTo receive one’s mandate from **Heaven** makes one the **Son of Heaven**,\nto receive it from the **Son of Heaven** makes one a **feudal lord**—\nwhere there is a mandate received, the one who grants it can **debase the other**.\nYet the Dao precedes all things in **ordaining their fates**—\nwho then could **confer rank upon it**?\n\nOnly **bestowal and deprivation** belong to none but itself,\nthus it abides **naturally and eternally**, and so is **revered and noble**.\n\nThe Dao **gives birth, nurtures, lengthens, matures, completes, ripens, nourishes, and shelters**.\nIt **generates without possession**, **acts without reliance**, **lengthens without domination**—\nthis is called **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\n*Lengthen* (長) is pronounced with a rising tone.\n\nThese eight are the **primordial functions of the Great Dao**,\nand **non-possession, non-reliance, non-domination** all stem from **selflessness**—\nthis is the **ultimate of Virtue**, profound and distant, hence **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\nThe meanings of the eight:\n**Generates** (生) is to **provide the beginning**,\n**Nurtures** (畜) is to **encompass fully**,\n**Lengthens** (長) is to **fulfill their form**,\n**Matures** (育) is to **refine their substance**,\n**Completes** (成) is to **assist their function**,\n**Ripens** (熟) is to **fulfill their time**,\n**Nourishes** (养) is to **preserve their harmony**,\n**Shelters** (覆) is to **guard against harm**.\n\nThough it begins with **Virtue nurturing**, all ultimately return to the **Dao**—\nfor nothing is outside the Dao.\n\nThough it starts with the **Dao**, it ends with **Mysterious Virtue**—\nfor without **ultimate Virtue**, the **Great Dao** would not solidify.\nIn truth, they are one.\n\n---\n**Chapter 51: *He Shang* on Nurturing Virtue**\n\nThis chapter elucidates the **wondrous root** and the **responsive generation** of all things,\nclarifying why all things **revere the Dao and honor Virtue**,\nthen praises the **functions of generation and nurturing**,\nand finally extols the **Virtue of forgetting merit**.\n\n**Heaven and Earth** have a beginning,\nand thus are called the **Mother of all things**.\n\nHaving obtained the **Mother**, one knows her **children**;\nhaving known the **children**, one must **return to guard the Mother**—\nthen one’s life will never perish.\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed, the Dao **eternally stood**,\nyet all things **draw from this beginning to be born**—\nthus it is called **Mother**.\n\nOnce the **origin is obtained**, the **Mother is known**,\nand thus the **form is established**.\n\nMoreover, one must discern that the Dao **never ceases to be present within all things**—\nfor all that **draws from the Dao to be born** are its **children**.\nThus, by **turning back to examine the children**, one’s understanding is boundless.\n\nHaving known the **children**, one must not **lose the root for the branches**,\nhence the admonition to **return and guard the Mother**.\n\nIf humanity **abides in effortless spontaneity**,\nand remains **pure without ceasing**,\nthen all things and all affairs will **each find their place**—\nthere is no other method, nor any intention to **guard** it.\n\n**Responding to things** is **transformation**,\n**Within oneself** is **the numinous**—\nsuch is all there is.\n\nThe **substance of the Dao** is **indistinctly unified**,\nand thus is the **single source** from which all differences arise—\nhence, by obtaining the **Mother**, one knows the **children**.\n\nThe **function of the Dao** is **boundless**,\nand thus the **single source** gives rise to all differences—\nhence, by knowing the **children**, one must **return and guard the Mother**.\n\nThus, one **unifies beginning and end, essence and manifestation**,\nand **returns to the origin while completing the cycle**—\nthen **life and death bring no confusion**,\nhence it is said: **\"One’s life will never perish.\"**\n\n**Seal your joy (兑)**, **close your gates**—\nthen your whole life will be **unlabored**.\n**Open your joy**, **pursue your affairs**—\nthen your whole life will be **unsaved**.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says: **\"Joy (兑) is delight.\"**\nWhen the **heart-mind** indulges in **pleasure and attachment**, it is **defiled**.\n\n**Gates** are the **portals of the senses**.\nTo **seal** and **close** is to instruct the learner in **guarding the Mother**—\nthat is, to **restrain speech**, **moderate diet**, **quiet emotions**, **preserve the spirit-qi**,\nto **view and listen with propriety**, to **move and rest in harmony**—\nthese are all ways to **nourish the form and cultivate Virtue**,\nand thus one’s life will **flourish without toil**.\n\nIf one does the opposite—\nabandoning the **inner** while **pursuing external delight**—\nthen one’s life will be **endlessly exhausted**, yet **never saved**.\n\n**Seeing what is small** is called **clarity**,\n**holding to gentleness** is called **strength**.\n\n**Using its light**, yet **returning to its clarity**—\nwithout **leaving behind calamity**—\nthis is called **inheriting constancy**.\n\n*遗 (遗)* is pronounced as *yí* (with the *yì* rhyme), meaning **to leave behind**.\n\nOnly the **Dao is formless**—\nit cannot be **seen with the eyes**, hence it is **small**;\nit cannot be **obtained by force**, hence it is **gentle**.\n\nTo **perceive it precisely** without **being obscured by things** is **clarity**;\nto **hold to it steadfastly** without **being taken by things** is **strength**.\n\nThe scholar, **concentrating the mind** and **deliberating deeply**,\n**sets it down and savors it**—\nthen the **nurturing function** is achieved.\n\nMoreover, **seeing** and **holding** are the **practices of cultivation**,\nwhile **clarity** and **strength** are the **manifest effects**.\n\n**Clarity** is the **substance**,\n**Light** is the **function**—\nsaying that the **still-stored substance** is established,\nthen the **active perception** must necessarily follow,\njust as the **light of clarity** illuminates things—\nthe **substance remains unharmed**, while the **function is boundless**.\n\nYet one must also **harmonize the light without dazzling**,\n**conceal the wisdom in ignorance**,\nthen **retreat into obscurity**—\nand thus **calamities cannot reach**.\n\nThis is called **properly transmitting the

**language of the cultivator**.\n\n**Chapter 52**—*He Shang* names it **\"Returning to the Origin, Reverting to the Root\"**.\nThis chapter elucidates the **Dao/Way of returning to the source and embracing the root**.\nSome say that the **origin** is **qi**—\nfor all mortals are born from **qi**, thus **qi** is the **mother**,\nwhile the **spirit** abides within **qi**, hence the **child**.\nWhen **mother** and **child** are in harmony, the **spirit** is tranquil and the **qi** is focused—\nthis too is the **initial mechanism for entering the Dao**.\n\nIf one were to say, *\"I possess knowledge and walk the Great Dao,\"*\nonly **deeds** would be worthy of fear.\nThe Great Dao is vast and unobstructed,\nwith neither origin nor end—\nit cannot be grasped by **intellect** nor discerned by **perception**,\nfor it is without contrivance or deliberate action.\nNow, if one were to say, *\"I possess knowledge and walk the Great Dao,\"*\nthis mind has already begun to **lean upon** and **cling to** something—\nthus, only such **deliberate actions** are truly worthy of fear.\n\nFor the previous chapter exhorted one to **guard the mother** in practice,\nthis chapter now warns against the **harm of contrivance**.\nThe Great Dao is most **plain and simple**,\nyet mortals prefer **shortcuts**.\n*\"Good\"* (read with falling tone)—\nThe *Ding Guan Jing* says:\n*\"To seek the Dao against the Dao,\nto resent the Dao yet lack compassion for it.\"*\nIndeed, preferring **shortcuts** means one will never reach the **principle**.\nThe **palace** is **exhausted** by **excessive adornment**,\nand the **heart** is **overwrought** by **excessive scheming**—\nthis is **internal depletion**.\nIf speaking of the **body**, then the **palace** is the **three fields**—\nthe **storehouse** is where **vital essence and qi** dwell,\nsuch as the **stomach** being the **Great Granary**.\nTo **don fine attire** and **wear sharp blades**,\nto **overindulge in food** while **wealth overflows**,\nis called **plundering and boasting**—\nthis is **not the Dao**!\n*\"Overindulge\"* means **excess**.\nAll these are **failures to cultivate internally** while **ostentatiously displaying externally**—\nthis is **teaching plunder**,\nhow could it be the **practice of the Great Dao**?\nThe **Wen Gong** says:\n*\"To wear beauty without propriety,\nto gorge on food without satiety—\nthus it is called **plundering and boasting**.\"*\nWhy does such **boasting** arise?\nIs it not because one **desires to practice the Dao** yet **further digresses into political scheming**?\n\n**Chapter 53**—*He Shang* names it **\"Further Validation\"**.\nThis chapter states that **knowledge alone is insufficient to illuminate the Dao**,\npreferring **shortcuts is insufficient to walk the Dao**,\nand that **unverified is mistaken for verified**,\n**unobtained is mistaken for obtained**—\nall these are **not the Dao**.\n\n*\"The well-established will not be uprooted,\nthe well-embraced will not be cast off,\nand descendants continue in **sacrifice** without ceasing.\"*\nThe Dao **encompasses** the heavens and earth,\n**permeates** the ancient and the present,\n**embraces** all above and below without being uprooted,\n**circulates** through all transformations without being cast off—\nwhen **yin** and **yang** alternate, the **new** arises from the **old**,\njust as descendants **inherit** without end.\nThe cultivator must first **establish the central** to **ground their foundation**,\nthen **rootedness** will be **unshakable**;\nembrace **oneness** to **focus their vigilance**,\nthen **attachment** will be **unbreakable**.\nWhen **virtue/power** flourishes and **benefits others**,\nthe **later awakened** will **revere it**—\nuntil its **source is deep and its current long**,\npassed down through generations,\nevermore **intimate** with time.\n\nThe **Wen Gong** says:\n*\"The **unrooted** is **deep-rooted and firmly established**, **unshakable**.\nThe **uncast off** is **the people’s hearts in submission**, **unsubverted**.\nThe **unceasing** is **long-lasting prosperity**.\"*\nCultivate it **within oneself**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **true**;\ncultivate it **within the family**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **abundant**;\ncultivate it **within the village**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **enduring**;\ncultivate it **within the state**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **prosperous**;\ncultivate it **throughout the world**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **universal**.\n**True** means **unfeigned**;\n**abundant** means **effortlessly ample**;\n**enduring** means **nothing is beyond its reach**;\n**prosperous** means **nothing is lacking**;\n**universal** means **nothing is excluded**.\nFor the Dao’s **truth** lies in **self-cultivation**,\nits **overflow** in **governing others**—\nyet cultivating it **within oneself** is the **principle**.\nExtending it to **family, state, and world**,\nit remains **no different in essence**.\nThe **Wen Gong** says:\n*\"All follow the **root** to govern the **branches**,\nfrom the **near** to the **far**.\"*\n\nThus, one

**world**.\nHow do I know the **world** is thus?\nBecause of this.\nThe **method of observation** is **not distant**—\nwhy seek it elsewhere?\nThough **things differ in outward division**,\nthey share **one root**—\nto observe them thus, none will fail to align.\nThis meaning should be **silently grasped beyond words**.\n\nThe *Kai Yuan* commentary says:\n*\"By the **method of self-cultivation**,\none observes the **true nature of the body**—\nits **origin** is **pure and cool**;\nonce **seen**, all **perceptions** are **discarded**;\nknowing **emptiness**, even

Through Observation\"**.\nThis chapter elucidates **cultivating oneself and extending to all things**.\nThe broader the **cultivation**, the farther its **reach**.\n**Knowledge** and **rectification

      "translated_text": "**Chapter LVII**\n\n*River Above* says: The ancient sages were gentle yet far-reaching, capable yet near—\nthey had no desire for war,\nonly resorting to military campaigns when absolutely necessary.\nThus, governing the state with rectitude is the proper way,\nwhile employing force in war is the expedient measure.\n\nThe world is a divine instrument—\nit cannot be coerced.\nTherefore, those who embody the Dao simply remain effortlessly tranquil,\nthough they have no conscious intention of taking the world,\nyet the world naturally submits to them.\n\nThe more prohibitions a ruler imposes,\nthe poorer the people grow.\nThe more weapons a people wield,\nthe more corrupt the state becomes.\nThe more cunning they are,\nthe more strange objects proliferate.\nThe more laws are promulgated,\nthe more thieves and robbers arise.\n\nIf one abandons the principle of *non-action* (無為) in governance\nand instead multiplies prohibitions,\nthe people will lose their bearings and resort to mechanical schemes.\n\nIf the ruler is likened to the world,\nthen the mind is the sovereign,\nand *qi* (氣) is the people.\nBut if one clings to petty techniques,\nfixates on private intelligence,\ndrowns in endless stratagems,\nand indulges the six vices (六賊),\nthen *non-action* (無為) becomes impossible.\n\n*River Above* says: When rulers multiply prohibitions,\nthe common people’s grievances cannot reach above—\nthen the people will grow impoverished and helpless.\n\nWeapons are the tools of *power politics* (權謀).\nThe sovereign who practices *non-action* (無為)\nsimply ensures the people have no knowledge or desires.\nIf the sovereign and the people deceive each other through intelligence,\nthe people will grow cunning,\nand the sovereign will grow increasingly bewildered and corrupt.\n\nStrange objects are marvels and oddities.\nIf people abandon their fundamental occupations\nand pursue frivolous enterprises,\nthen useless and extraordinary things will emerge.\nIf rulers fear the people’s deceit\nand thus issue excessive laws to suppress it,\nthe people will be at a loss,\nand thieves and robbers will multiply daily.\n\nThus the sage says:\n*I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love tranquility, yet the people align with propriety;\nI remain without affairs, yet the people grow wealthy;\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.*\nThis is the natural response,\nand the success of *non-action*.\n\n**Right, the fifty-seventh chapter.**\n*River Above* names it *Pure Wind* (淳風).\nThis chapter elucidates the governance of *non-action*.\n\nIts governance is *mysterious and expansive* (闷闷),\nits people are *pure and harmonious* (淳淳).\n*Mysterious* (闷), pronounced *wǎn*, rhymes with *mò* (莫) and *bèn* (奔),\nsymbolizing the broad, yielding, and effortless nature of governance.\n\nThose of *virtue/power* (德),\nwhen it comes to matters of right and wrong,\nare always clearly distinct,\nyet their capacity is vast and boundless.\nThus, governing with *virtue/power*,\nthey do not scrutinize the common people with rigid laws.\nThough it may appear to the vulgar eye\nas if they do nothing,\nthe people are truly moved by the natural transformation,\nmaking this the ultimate governance of purity and harmony.\n\nIts governance is rigid and scrutinizing (察察),\nits people are deficient and chaotic (缺缺).\nOnly those who do not know\nto cultivate *virtue/power* as the foundation of governance,\nand instead rely solely on cleverness,\nseek to impose order on the people through laws and punishments.\nBut the people cannot be suddenly made uniform—\nif one insists on forcing uniformity,\nthen injury will inevitably occur,\nand thus their chaos.\n\nThis is what is called:\n*harm arises from kindness, disaster lurks in fortune.*\n*Disaster, oh disaster, is fortune’s companion;\nfortune, oh fortune, is disaster’s shadow.*\nWho knows their limits?\nFor it is said that disaster and fortune intertwine,\nand none can know where they cease or begin.\n\nIs there no distinction between right and wrong?\nIf so, then is there no fixed principle of right?\nRight itself becomes expedient,\ngoodness itself becomes *heretical* (祆).\nThe people’s confusion is long-standing.\n\nOnly the worldly are bewildered by the shallow clarity of rigid laws,\nand do not comprehend the completeness of the true Dao.\nThey cannot rest in the ultimate right,\nand instead take expedient measures as the standard of right;\nthey cannot follow the ultimate goodness,\nand instead regard heresy as goodness.\n\nWhen their responses diverge,\nthey do not know to reflect inward\non the source of their own confusion,\nbut instead revere the external manifestations of right and wrong.\nThis is a profound and long-standing deviation from the true Dao.\n\nIt is also like governance—\nunable to contain the people with broad, mysterious virtue,\nand instead insisting on rigid scrutiny as the measure of goodness and right,\nthey fail to realize that this will lead to the very chaos they seek to avoid.\nThus, the following passage urges the cultivation of the sage’s virtue.\n\nThe *Kai Yuan* (開元) annotation says:\n*When beings cling to delusion,*\n*the truly right is seen as cunning deceit,*\n*and the truly good is seen as heretical strangeness.*\nThus, disaster and fortune intertwine,\nas if there were no true rightness at all.\n\nHence the sage is square yet not rigid,\nonly acting squarely while embodying rounded virtue—\nthus no trace of rigid division remains.\nFrugal yet not harmful,\nclear yet accommodating—\nthus no injury occurs.\nStraightforward yet not domineering,\nfor great straightness seems like bending—\nthus no forceful imposition.\nLuminous yet not dazzling,\nreturning to its natural brightness.",

sound—\nrefrains from excessive display, embodying restraint, concealment, and steadfastness.\n\nThose who study the Dao long enough\nwill broaden their heart and fill their **qi** (*氣*),\nthus attaining the fullness of **heavenly virtue** (*天德*).\nThis is the **\"ultimate sincerity\"** (*至诚*) that exhausts one’s own nature,\nand only then can one exhaust the nature of others—\nreaching even to the point of harmonizing with heaven and earth.\n\nIndeed, the principle of humanity and heaven is one,\nwith no separation at all.\n\n*Mèng Shì* (*孟氏*) says:\n*\"To preserve the heart and nurture one’s nature*\n*is the way to serve heaven.\"*\n\nOnly through **frugality** (*jǐn*) can one return early,\nand returning early is called **repeatedly accumulating virtue** (*重积德*).\n**Repeatedly** (*重*)—pronounced with a falling tone—means *again*.\n*Wén Gōng* (*文公*) says:\n*\"Returning early\"* refers to the ability to correct faults without delay.\n**Repeatedly accumulating virtue** means that one has already amassed some virtue,\nand through **frugality** (*jǐn*), nurtures it further—\nthis is another layer of accumulation, like those who cultivate early\nand, having not yet suffered loss, promptly correct themselves.\n\nRepeatedly accumulating virtue,\none can overcome all obstacles.\nOvercoming all obstacles,\none’s capacity knows no bounds.\n\nOnly **virtue** (*德*) can conquer things,\nso when one’s personal virtue is fully realized,\nits measure and extent are boundless.\n\nBoundless virtue can establish a state.\nA state founded upon such virtue can endure.\n\nThe

establish a state;\nusing **frugality** (*jǐn*) to serve heaven, one attains deep-rooted stability.\"*\n\nThe sages of antiquity preserved their nature and destiny,\nnot expending their inner essence on external affairs,\nthus their roots were deep and their foundations firm—\nunassailable by force.\nThough long life and enduring vision were possible,\nthey were not the ultimate aim.\n\nIn governing humanity and serving heaven,\nthough there are distinctions between inner and outer,\nnothing surpasses **frugality** (*jǐn*).\n\n*Chéng Yī Chuān* (*程伊川*) says:\n*\"The method of cultivation that prolongs one’s years,\nthe method of governance that invokes heaven’s blessing for a state’s longevity,\nand the way common folk ascend to sagehood—\nall these are the same.\nWhen one reaches this point,\nthese effects naturally follow.\"*\n\n**Chapter 59** – *Hé Shàng* names it **Abiding by the Dao** (*Shǒu Dào*).\nThis passage clarifies the use of **frugality** (*jǐn*).\nGoverning the

all things find their proper order.\nHence, ghosts too have no need to exert their supernatural influence.\n\nIt is not that their ghosts lack supernatural power,\nbut that their supernatural power does not harm people—\nbecause the sage does not harm the people.\nThus, ghosts and spirits all respond to his **virtue** (*德*) and transformation.\nThe two sides harmonize and delight in each other,\nand all virtues converge—\nthis is the governance of **ultimate virtue** (*至德*).\n\n*Liè Zǐ* (*列子*)’s discussion of sage governance\nextends even to the point where *\"all things lack blemish

of livestock;\n**yang** (*牡*), pronounced *Mǒu* (*某*), is the *male* or *father* of livestock.\n**Yin** (*静*) always conquers **yang** (*牡*) through stillness,\nand stillness is the lowest.\n\nThus,

the world’s convergence—\nthe meaning of *abiding in yin* (*守雌*) as the world’s *stream* (*溪*).\n\n**Taking** (*以取*) means that a great state,\nthrough its ability to abide below,\nultimately takes

elucidates how, through virtue, one abides below,\nand how people converge and return in response.\n\n**Qingyuanzi** said:\nThe body is the model of a state.\nWhen the body is empty, all things come;\nwhen the heart is without, harmonious *qi* returns.\nThis is what is meant by *abiding in yin* (*守雌*) and *embracing oneness* (*抱一*)—\nthat is, *yang* descending to refine *yin*,\ntransforming into pure *yang*,\nthe subtlety of *wuwei*.\n\nThis is another meaning.\n\n**Dao** is the essence of all things.\n*奥* (*Ào*), pronounced *yú-dào* (於到切).\nThe *Shuowen Jiezi* says:\n*\"The southwest corner of a hall\"*—\ndeep and secluded, like the inner sanctum.\nTruly, the Dao is vast and undivided,\nits greatness without bounds,\nall things contained within it and sustained by it.\nIts smallness without limits,\nyet all things are also within it, unseen.\nThus, the *Xisheng Jing* says:\n*\"The Dao is profound and mysterious,\nan abyss of emptiness and nothingness.*\nThe treasure of the virtuous,\nthe refuge of the unvirtuous.\nThough a person may be unvirtuous,\nthey cannot escape relying on the Dao for life—\nthus, it is their refuge.\"\n\n**Wen Gong** said:\nThe virtuous guard and use it,\nwhile the unvirtuous also depend on the Dao for security.\nFine words can be traded,\nand noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\nHow could one abandon those who are unvirtuous?\n*行* (*xíng*), pronounced *qù-shēng* (去声).\nTruly, all people possess this nature;\neven the lowest fool cannot lack the Dao-heart.\nHow distant is the Dao from people?\nThus, the most beautiful words are known to all,\nand the most noble conduct is within everyone’s reach.\nIf someone, having committed wrong in the morning,\nhears the great Dao in the evening,\nthey will abandon their falsehood and return to their true nature—\neven if one tries to point out their wrongdoing,\nit cannot be found.\nHow could they be abandoned?\nOnly salvation is needed—\nthis is the refuge of the unvirtuous.\n\nThus, establishing the Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers,\neven with a *hongbi* jade and four-horse chariot as tribute,\nis not as precious as sitting and offering the Dao.\n*先* (*xiān*), pronounced *shì-xiàn* (悉荐切).\n*Hongbi* (*拱璧*)—a jade of perfect curvature, the finest of gems.\n*Si* (*驷马*)—four horses harnessed to a single carriage.\nIn ancient tribute rituals, when presenting a four-horse carriage,\none would lead with a *hongbi* jade.\nThough the Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers are noble by power,\nand *hongbi* and four-horse carriages are noble by material wealth,\nthey are not as noble as calmly offering the Dao.\nThe Dao is inherently possessed by all—\nthis is true nobility.\nYet the Three Ministers and *hongbi* are granted by fate,\nnot something one can casually attain.\nPeople should strive for what is inherently theirs,\nand what comes from outside is of little worth.\n\nWhy did the ancients value the Dao so highly?\nWas it not because *\"seeking leads to obtaining\"*—\nthat even crimes can be pardoned?\n\nThis is why the Dao is the most noble under heaven.\n\n**Question:** What is the meaning of valuing the Dao so highly?\nIt is because one does not seek externally but finds it within—\nthus, seeking brings benefit to obtaining.\nHe who is resolute in the Dao will have no evil.\nOnly by not relying on external means to attain it\ndoes one rise above calamity and fortune,\nand how could misfortune reach them?\nThis is why the Dao is the most noble under heaven.\n\nSome say:\n*\"Seeking leads to obtaining\"*—the treasure of the virtuous;\n*\"Crimes can be pardoned\"*—the refuge of the unvirtuous.\n\nThis is Chapter 62: *The Most Noble Under Heaven*.\n**He Shang** names it *Dao*.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao as:\n*Wuwei* (*为无为*), *wu shi* (*事无事*), *wu wei* (*味无味*).\nGreat and small, many and few—\nrepaying resentment with virtue.\n\nTo engage with form brings great and small,\nto be bound by numbers brings many and few.\nThe distinctions of great and small,\nthe divisions of many and few—\nthis is how resentment arises.\nOnly the Dao, beyond form and number, unites with the sage.\n*Wuwei* emerges from *wuwei*,\n*wu shi* from *wu shi*,\nand *wu wei* from *wu wei*—\nthus, it contains the boundless *Taipe* within the square inch,\nunburdened by the slightest private desire,\ngathering all things in the One Truth,\nunmoved by high or low, external conditions.\nThus, each thing returns to its own nature,\neach matter to its own course,\nand great and small, many and few—\nviewed as one, hatred and love vanish,\nsage and commoner alike are undone,\nand what resentment remains to be repaid?\nOnly virtue can contain it.\n\nMoreover, if one’s intentions are extinguished,\nit is like the heavens and earth covering and nurturing all without distinction.\nYet this is what common people find most difficult.\nOnly through earnest questioning and contemplation,\ngradually cultivating it,\ncan one attain this state.\n\nThe following text outlines the method of cultivation to reach perfection.\n\n*\"Difficulties arise from what is easy,\nthe great from what is small.*\nThe most difficult matters under heaven begin with ease,\nthe greatest matters under heaven begin with the minute.\nThe Dao exists in the intervals of rising, resting, eating, and breathing—\nthis is easy.\nYet when it reaches its fullness,\nonly the sage can attain it—\nthis is difficult.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 64**\n*Named \"Shǒuwēi\" by Heshang*\nThis chapter praises the sage’s learning of *wuwei*, warning against the faults of action and attachment.\n\n**Fragility**—*ruì*, pronounced with the *ruǐ* rhyme—refers to the tender, easily broken state, meaning desires are not yet firm. **Dispersion**—*pàn*—is like ice melting. This too follows the meaning of the previous chapter: if preserved when it has not yet sprouted, it becomes one with nature, hence *\"easy to hold, easy to plan.\"* If observed at the moment of first sprouting, it will not stray far before returning, hence *\"easy to nurture, easy to disperse.\"* **\"Unseen\"** refers to the time of *wuwei* and *wuwei*—when there is no thought, no action. **\"Undisturbed\"** refers to the time when it is just beginning and has not yet sunk into disorder. To act and govern at this moment means success without effort.\n\nYet reason arises suddenly, and enlightenment dissipates suddenly, while practice does not achieve perfection all at once—only through gradual cultivation. Hence, the following text speaks of nurturing virtue.\n\nA tree of embrace grows from the smallest sprout;\nA nine-tiered tower begins with a clod of earth;\nA thousand-*li* journey starts beneath one’s feet.\nThese are words of exhortation, saying:\nOne must establish resolve beyond things and act with reverence within them—knowing and acting, striving for substance and root, never neglecting the minute, never overlooking the humble. Cultivate with meticulous care, nurture with enduring patience, and thus even the small may become great, the low may rise high, and the distant may be reached.\n\nYet if even a thread of scheming for gain or calculating success enters first, it will only hinder the Dao. Hence, it is further elaborated:\n\nThose who act will fail;\nThose who cling will lose.\nThus, *wuwei* means no failure,\nAnd *wuji* (non-attachment) means no loss.\nThe people’s undertakings often falter when nearly complete.\nIf one remains as cautious at the end as at the beginning, there will be no failed endeavors.\n\n*Jǐ*—level tone—\nFor Heaven’s principles are subtle and profound; private intelligence has no part in them. Thus, those who exert intention act with *wei*, and those who relax even slightly fail. Only by guarding with spontaneity does true strength accumulate over time, and virtue naturally form.\n\nTherefore, the sage desires what others do not desire,\nAnd values not the hard-to-obtain treasures.\nHe learns what others do not learn,\nReturning to the errors of the common people.\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things\nWithout daring to act.\n\nThe Dao is without desire—\nBy \"desire,\" it means seeking what is within oneself.\nNot desiring external things as noble,\nTrue learning is *wuwei*—\nNot indulging in excessive knowledge as learning,\nBut only returning to the common people’s excesses of emotion and desire,\nRestoring them to their origin.\n\nThis Dao was never sought externally,\nNor could the sage make it a model for others.\nMoreover, all things have their own natural Dao.\nThe sage only follows the principles of nature and life to establish teaching,\nGuiding them to balance without daring to artificially benefit or aid growth.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 65**\n*Named \"Chúndé\" by Heshang*\nThis chapter clarifies how using intelligence breeds delusion, demonstrating the rule of profound virtue’s great harmony.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 67**\n*Named \"Sān Bǎo\" (Three Treasures) by Heshang*\nThis chapter declares that though the Dao’s essence is supreme,\nIts practice rests upon compassion.\n\nThe virtuous warrior does not rage,\nNor fights unless compelled—\nSuch conflict does not spring from private desires.\nThe one who best conquers foes does not contend,\nFor it is only the heart that does not contend\nWhich can overcome the contending of others.\nThose greedy for victory who strike first are certain to fail.\nThe adept at using others places himself beneath them.\nWhen his virtue is humble and yielding,\nOthers gladly serve him—\nFor his sincerity evokes their willingness to labor.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThis is called the power of using others,\nThis is called the ancient harmony with Heaven’s extreme.\n\nOnly through non-contention and yielding\nDoes one abandon cleverness and artifice,\nFollow Heaven’s natural order,\nAnd thus align with Heaven’s own virtue.\n\nMaster Wén Jiǎn said:\n*\"When virtue merges with Heaven,\nIt surpasses all since the birth of humanity.\"*\n\n**Chapter 68**\n*Named \"Pèi Tiān\" (Harmony with Heaven) by Heshang*\nThis chapter sets forth four virtues to illustrate the harmony with Heaven.\n\nIn wielding arms, there is a saying:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,\nI dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot.\"*\n\nThis is called:\n*\"Moving without movement,\nWarding off without arms,\nResisting without enemies,\nGrasping without weapons.\"*\n*(行: Upper as in the character, lower pronounced as *hù jiàng* (户刚切).)*\n\nMaster Wén Dìng said:\n*\"To act is to be the aggressor (*主*),\nTo respond is to be the defender (*客*).\nTo advance is to harbor intent for contention,\nTo retreat is to lack such intent.\nOnly when one lacks intent for contention\nDoes wielding arms equal not wielding at all—\nThus it is hard to advance but easy to retreat.\nEven amid war’s chaos,\nIf there is no movement to be made,\nNo arms to wield,\nNo enemies to resist,\nNo weapons to seize,\nHow could there ever be blame for wielding arms?\"*\n\nNo greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy—\nUnderestimating the enemy risks losing one’s treasure.\nThus, when armies clash in battle,\nThe compassionate prevail.\n\n*(几: Level tone.\n丧: Departing tone, meaning \"lose.\"\n抗: To raise/lift.)*\n\nMaster Wén Dìng said:\n*\"Since compassion is the treasure,\nTo underestimate the enemy is to lighten the fight,\nTo lighten the fight is to risk killing—\nThis is to lose what one holds dear.\nWhen two armies raise their forces in conflict,\nAnd I act only when compelled,\nThen my heart is filled with pity for slaughter—\nWhen pity is seen, Heaven and humanity aid me.\nThough I might wish not to conquer,\nIt cannot be helped.\"*\n\n**Chapter 69**\n*Named \"Xuànyòng\" (Mysterious Application) by Heshang*\nThis chapter uses the metaphor of warfare to elucidate the Dao,\nWith the key resting in safeguarding compassion.\n\nSome say:\n*\"If applied to the human body,\nThen wicked thoughts are more numerous than enemy states,\nAnd desires for gain surpass the sharpest blades—\nIs this not also the case of few desires reaching the state of no desires,\nThus preserving one’s treasure?\"*\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to practice.\nYet none under Heaven can know them,\nNone can practice them.\n\nHuman nature is inherently fixed and shared—\nPointing this out to others,\nIt should seem as though there is nothing difficult to know or practice.\nYet Heaven’s principles are vast and undivided—\nIf one deviates by even a hair’s breadth,\nThe error grows vast as a thousand miles,\nFor it cannot be illuminated by calculation.\nThus, those who overthink exceed the mark,\nWhile those who forget fall short—\nHence none can truly know it.\n\nIt cannot be reached by gradual steps—\nThose who seek quick gains favor shortcuts,\nWhile those lacking strength abandon half the path—\nHence none can truly practice it.\n\nWords have their root,\nAffairs have their master.\nWords are the elucidation of the Dao,\nAffairs are the manifestation of the Dao.\nTeaching without words,\nActing without action—\nIs this not the root and the master?\n\nThis is why the dull-witted and the obstructed\nCannot know or practice it.\n\nOnly because of their lack of knowing\nAre they not known by me.\n\nMaster Wén Dìng said:\n*\"The ancient sages had no thoughts, no actions,\nYet there remained those who were vaguely unaware of their own existence.\nThis is beyond the reach of deliberation—\nThus none ever truly knew them.\"*\n\nFew know me,\nHence my worth is great.\n\nMaster Wén Jiǎn said:\n*\"The Dao is vast,\nThus few understand it.\"*\n\nHence the sage wears coarse garments while treasuring jade.\n*(The Commentary says:\n*\"The sage conceals himself in Heaven without boasting or startling others.\")*\n\nQīngyuán Zǐ said:\n*\"To wear coarse garments is to blend with the common dust,\nTo treasure jade is to embrace the Dao and nurture virtue.\"*\n\nMaster Wén Jiǎn said:\n*\"Coarse garments are the necessities of daily life,\nShared by all the world.\nJade is the most precious of goods,\nUnique to me alone.\nFew know me—\nThis alone reveals the Dao’s summit.\nYet the sage does not flaunt his differences,\nFor even his most profound and unknowable mysteries\nAre displayed in the mundane and shared,\nSo that all may grasp them.\nThis is what Confucius meant by:\n*'I have no secrets from you.'*\"*\n\n**Chapter 70**\n*Named \"Zhī Nán\" (Knowing Difficulty) by Heshang*\nThis chapter shows that the Dao is very easy to know and practice,\nYet overlooked, it becomes very difficult.\n\nTo know what one does not know—this is excellence;\nTo not know what one knows—this is illness.\n\nOnly true knowing\nUnites with the Dao,\nThus it is not hindered by knowledge—\nThis is the virtue’s summit.\n\nIf one does not reach true knowing\nYet claims to know,\nThen he destroys substance with words,\nDrowns the mind in superficiality—\nTo force knowing is to fall ill,\nThis is the virtue’s disease.\n\nOnly because of illness\nDoes one avoid illness.\nThe sage’s non-illness\nComes from his illness of illness—\nThus he avoids illness.\n\nOnly because he knows illness for what it is\nDoes he not fall into it.\n\nThe sage is born knowing—\nHis illness is inherently nonexistent,\nNo need to diagnose his illness\nBefore attaining the state of non-illness.\n\nTo say *\"illness of illness\"*\nIs to show the student the medicine of illness,\nSo that he diagnoses the sickness of forced knowing\nAnd awakens to true knowing, dispelling his illness—\nThen illness and medicine are both removed,\nAbilities and objects vanish together,\nAnd he begins to realize:\n*\"From the start, there was no illness at all.\"*\nThus he aligns with the sage.",
      "overlap_context": "ls short in any way,\nHeaven will still rescue and shield him with compassion—\nThis is the Dao’s principle of reciprocity,\nFor Heaven’s nature loves to return,\nEver favoring the good.\n\nWén Jiǎn said:\n*\"To depart from unity and embrace division—\nThis is how the Dao rescues.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter 67**\n*Named \"Sān Bǎo\" by Heshang*\nThis chapter clarifies that the Dao’s essence is supreme,\nYet its practice relies on compassion.\n\nThe virtuous scholar does not resort to force,\nHe does not valorize strength.」",

the myriad threats of all things assail them,\nAnd they tremble all their lives.\n\nThere is such a great threat, yet they do not know it.\nIf they truly know it,\nLife and death are equalized,\nGain and loss are balanced—\nBoldly advancing, acting without hesitation,\nThen this great threat shines clearly before them.\n\nDo not narrow their dwelling,\nDo not weary of their birth.\nOnly because one does not weary of it,\nIs one able not to weary of it.\n\n*\"Narrow\"* (狭) is pronounced *xu* (胡夹切), meaning confined.\n*\"Weary\"* (厌) is pronounced *yàn* (於艳切), meaning to abandon.\n\n*\"Do not\"* (无) should be rendered as *\"must not\"* (毋).\n\nTheir dwelling is the ground of their nature—\nTo dwell in the vastness of all things,\nThen they align their substance with the Great Void.\n\nTheir birth is the gathering of *qi*—\nContaining the utmost essence of the Great One,\nThen they share their function with Creation.\n\nOnly the *curved scholars* (曲士) cannot be spoken to of the Dao.\nIf they do not drown in petty transformations,\nAnd truly embody what is without,\nThen they narrow their dwelling by clinging to the *\"no\"* and abandoning the *\"yes\"*,\nAnd are obscured by the doctrine of annihilation,\nWearying of their birth.\n\nThus I teach them: *\"Must not narrow, must not weary,\"*\nSo that students may know:\nNature is the leader of *qi*,\nAnd its greatness is boundless—\nThey must expand and fill it to preserve its fullness.\nBirth is the abode of the Dao,\nAnd its function is inexhaustible—\nThey must cherish and nurture it to achieve its purpose.\n\nThen nurturing *qi* preserves life,\nExhausting nature reaches the vital principle,\nAnd they do not generate a heart of weary attachment,\nThus embodying *\"no non-force, no non-stubbornness,\"*\nAnd *\"long life is not the fault of life, nor is life an obstacle.\"*\n\nIf this is so,\nThen life and the Dao dwell together,\nAnd the Dao has never truly abandoned humans.\n\nThus the sage knows himself without revealing himself,\nLoves himself without esteeming himself,\nHence he discards the latter to take the former.\n\n*\"Revealing\"* (见) is pronounced *xiàn* (贤遍切), meaning to display.\n*\"Discards\"* (去) is pronounced with an ascending tone.\n\nTo know himself is to return to fearless self-reflection,\nNot narrowing his dwelling.\nTo love himself is to cut off external desires,\nNot wearying of his birth.\n\nOnly through self-knowing and self-loving\nDoes one dwell in security.\n\nAnd by not revealing himself to boast of his abilities,\nNot esteeming himself to belittle things,\nHe has no heart to know what is revealed,\nNor to forget what is loved.\n\nWen Ding said:\n*\"Even though one knows himself,\nHe must not reveal himself to others;\nEven though one loves himself,\nHe must not esteem himself to dazzle others—\nFor fear that others will weary or covet.\"*\n\nAs long as this heart is not forgotten,\nThere will still be fear.\nFear departs only when the great threat arrives,\nThus he discards the self-revealing and self-esteeming,\nAnd takes the self-knowing and self-loving.\n\nYet the sage’s movement and stillness are both in accordance with Heavenly Principle,\nWith no discarding or taking—\nThis is the teaching that opens the Dao and guides the common folk.\n\n---\n**Chapter 72** (河上名爱己)\nHeavenly River names *\"Love Oneself.\"*\nThis chapter dispels false delusions to preserve the true.\n\nTo be bold in daring is to kill,\nTo be bold in not daring is to live.\nThese two are either beneficial or harmful.\nWhat Heaven detests, who

harm.\n\nThe gentle and yielding are in accordance with life’s principle,\nBoldness here leads to living and benefit.\nThis is an immutable law,\nYet sometimes it reverses its norm—\nHence, *\"either beneficial or harmful.\"*\n\nThe strong and rigid are destined for death,\nTruly what Heaven detests.\nIf they escape by chance and have not yet suffered their fate,\nWho can know its reason?\nThus the sage finds it difficult.\n\nLiezi said:\n*\"To meet Heaven’s intent,\nTo weigh benefit and harm—\nIt is better to let it be.\"*\n\nThis is indeed so.\nYet to exhaust its end and witness its full change,\nThere is never a moment without loss—\nHence the following passage elaborates upon it.\n\nWen Gong said:\n*\"The sage, regarding Heavenly Dao,\nDares not alter its words.*\n\nThe Dao of Heaven\nIs victorious without contention,\nWen Gong said:\n*\"To let things follow their natural course,\nAnd things cannot defy it.\"*\n\nIt responds without words,\nHeaven speaks of what?\nThe seasons proceed in their order—\nIts response to rewarding virtue and punishing licentiousness\nIs indeed without error.\n\nIt comes without being summoned,\nThe divine’s approach is spontaneous—\nThere is no favor or aversion,\nAs summer departs and winter arrives—\nHow could it await a summons before coming?\n\nIt is tranquil yet ever-strategic.\nYu’s Commentary says:\n*\"Virtue and conduct are always easily known,\nYet the perilous is discerned through them.\"*\n\nHeaven’s net is vast and encompassing,\nSparse yet never failing.\n\n*\"Fail\"* (失) may also be written as *\"leak\"* (漏).\n---\n**Chapter 73** (河上名任为)\nHeavenly River names *\"Act in Accordance.\"*\n\nThis chapter instructs that one must be bold in the Dao,\nNot bold in force.\nIt continues to clarify Heavenly Dao’s natural course,\nAnd concludes with a warning of Heaven’s net’s inexhaustibility,\nSo that people may believe it without doubt.\n\nThe people commonly do not fear death,\nHow can one frighten them with death?\n\nIf one makes the people constantly fear death,\nAnd treats them as if they were strange anomalies,\nI would seize and execute them—\nWho would dare?\n\nWen Ding

death,\nIt is of no benefit.\"*\n\nIf the people are at ease with governance,\nThen they always delight in life and fear death.\nIf there are deceitful or rebellious ones who disturb the group,\nThen I would seize and execute them—\nWho would dare not submit?\n\nThere are always those who hold the power of execution killing,\nAnd those who take their place killing—\nThis is like substituting for

world’s governance,\nIf deceitful or rebellious ones act freely,\nThen they are abandoned by Heaven—\nTo kill them is for Heaven to kill,\nNot for me.\"*\n\nOtherwise, it is to substitute for those who hold the power of execution killing—\nTo substitute for the Master Carpenter is to injure one’s hands,\nTo substitute for those who hold the power of execution killing is to involve oneself in the

grievance?\nNow, if one does not treat the root\nyet seeks to reconcile the branches,\nthough outwardly reconciled,\ninternally it is not forgotten—\nthis is excess grievance,\nhow can it be called

divergent paths.\n\nThe *Guī Shān* [圭山] collection’s annotations—\nare they not meant to illuminate the murky way within the obscured?\nThose who cling to the *Yóu Rén* [涂人]’s [lost traveler’s] perspective\nand question the *Gù Lú* [故庐] [old dwelling]—\nby this path, they may directly grasp the *Lǎo Zǐ*’s unified essence.\n\nI praise their earnest dedication and correct articulation,\nand thus commend this single annotation.\n\n---\n\nIn ancient times, Confucius had no fixed teacher,\nso figures like *Cháng Hóng* [苌弘], *Shī Xiāng* [师襄], *Lǎo Cōng* [老聪], and *Zhèng Zǐ* [郑子] all sought his counsel.\nYet observing his words,\nonly *Nán Gōng Jìng Shū* [南宫敬叔] inquired about the origins of rites and music,\nand the essence of *Dào Dé* [Dao/Virtue], from *Lǎo Dān* [老聃].\nCould *Lǎo Dān* truly be compared to those below *Cháng Hóng*?\nThe criticism of *Yuán Rǎng* [原壤] stemmed from his study of *Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] falling short of the Master’s Dao—\nthis was not a disparagement.\n\nThough Confucius grounded his teachings in tangible reality,\nand *Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] sought the Dao in emptiness—\nConfucius held that *Tài Jí* [太极], *Liǎng Yí* [两仪], *Sì Xiàng* [四象], and *Bā Guà* [八卦] were the foundation of all life,\nwhile *Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] declared:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two, Two gives birth to Three, Three gives birth to all things\"*—\ntheir numbers differ as well.\n\nConfucius wished people to know\nthat the Dao encompasses all things, is present everywhere, and never ceases;\n*Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] wished people to seek\nthe Dao in the beginning of Heaven, Earth, and all things.\nThe Dao is singular,\nyet its manifestations vary with each person’s focus.\nThe numbers are singular,\nyet their applications differ with each person’s use.\n\nTheir differences cannot be forced into uniformity.\n\nYet in embracing simplicity and preserving purity,\nin cultivating few desires and minimal self-interest to govern the heart,\nin nurturing the spirit and holding to the One,\nin extending gently and maintaining continuity to govern the body,\nin treating substance as the root of lightness,\nin treating stillness as the root of action,\nin not boasting, not claiming credit, and not contending to respond to things,\nin acting without action and desiring without desire,\nin removing excess and moderation to govern the state and the world—\neven the Sage cannot defy these principles.\n\nThus, *\"the mysterious female, the progenitor of the valley\"* [谷神玄牝],\n*Chéng Zǐ* [程子] adopted it;\nthe teachings on *\"nurturing qi\"* [养气],\n*Zhū Zǐ* [朱子] adopted them.\nHow could our school dismiss them lightly?\nThe *Guī Shān* [圭山] *Dòng Dàoshì* [董道士]’s annotations of *Lǎo Zǐ*’s *Dào Dé Jīng* [道德经]\ngather the merits of all ancient and modern interpretations,\nto elucidate and clarify the fundamental intent.\nEven those who attach themselves to *Lǎo Zǐ*’s teachings for the sake of cultivation\nshall find distinction in their origins and sequence.\nTheir labor is profound and greatly aids the Master’s teachings;\nreaders must not overlook them.\n\n**Written in summer at the *Qián Én Píng* [前恩平] residence during the *Bǎo Yòu* [宝佑] era of *Dīng Yì* [丁巳] (corrected to *Dīng Chǔ* [丁丑] in annotation).」",
