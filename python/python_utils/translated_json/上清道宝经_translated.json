  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Treasured Dao**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Treasured Dao*\n**Author:** Anonymous\n**Volume:** Five\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Treasured Dao, Volume One**\n**Chapter One**\n\nUpon yellow brocade it is laid,\nInscribed in cinnabar gold,\nBordered with purple gold,\nEnclosed in a brocade pouch.\n\nFrom the High Antiquity,\nThis scripture spans Middle and Lower Antiquity.\nWhoever possesses this text shall have:\nThe Five Thearchs’ defense,\nJade lads and jade maidens—three each—holding the scripture at their sides,\nThe Nine Stars’ dark canopy,\nAnd the assembly of perfected immortals, the Five Marchmounts’ numinous officials, attending the chamber day and night.\n\n**The Celestial August Inner Writ**\nMay be used to guard the household.\n\n**The Three Augusts’ Vermilion Writs in Five Chapters**\nRefined in the Cavern-Yang Lodge,\nPresented in the Flowing Fire Court,\nThey give rise to Heaven and establish Earth,\nAwakening the numinous spirits.\n\nShould the Son of Heaven obtain them, phoenixes shall come in homage, and the Five Stars align in harmony.\nShould feudal lords obtain them, the constellations shall contain their radiance.\nShould kings, nobles, or common folk obtain them, their jade-like essence shall ring clear.\nShould women obtain them, their countenance shall glow like the Great Sun, their complexion flowing with the Three Lights—fit for empresses and queens.\nThey soar into the clouds,\nThe true writs.\n\n**The Jade-Inscribed Writs**\nEmerge from the Nine Profound and Nine Heavens,\nDividing governance into Three Dao.\nWhen the Celestial Origin employs these writs,\nThe Three Luminaries scatter their veils,\nThe Five Thearchs fall from their stations,\nThe Nine Revolutions overturn,\nThe Seven Lodges flee their essences.\nWhen the Terrestrial Origin employs these writs,\nThe Nine Lands sink into ruin,\nThe Five Peaks collapse,\nMountains and rivers invert their courses.\n\n**The Three Origins’ Method**\nEncompasses the numinous chapters of *The Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern in Thirty-Nine Scrolls*.\nThese are the secret signs of the Three and Five,\nThe utmost essence of the true Dao,\nThe supreme chapters of the Three Ones,\nThe forbidden records of Jade Purity.\n\n**The Three Marvels’ Chapters**\nThe Jade Emperor’s precious writs,\nConcealed within the Palace of Great Existence above the Nine Heavens,\nIn the Jade Chamber of the Great Profound Numinous Terrace.\n\n**The Three Registers**\nThe Three Origins’ graded admonitions:\nGolden Register, Yellow Register, Jade Register.\n\n**The Three Scriptures**\nReceived under triple oversight.\n\n**The Three Caverns**\nJade Purity Cavern-Real,\nHighest Purity Cavern-Mystery,\nSupreme Purity Cavern-Spirit.\n\n**The Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern**\nThe loftiest resonance of Highest Purity,\nThe subtlest phrases of utmost reality.\n\n**The Numinous Treasure Scriptures**\nThe supreme rank of transcendent immortals,\nThe utmost truth of the Void Origin,\nThe profound treasure of the Great Dao,\nThe celestial writs of the Three Augusts.\nSome call them the *Jade Tablets of the Most High*.\n\nThese Three Cavern scriptures and talismans are the warp and weft of the Dao,\nThe profound lineage of the Great Void,\nThe foremost scriptures of the highest perfected,\nHow could they be heard by middling immortals?\n\n**The Cavern-Spirit, named the Dao of Immortal Treasures**\nConnects to the era of the Three Augusts.\n**The Cavern-Mystery, named the Dao of Numinous Treasures**\nRescues and delivers the age of the Five Thearchs.\n**The Cavern-Real, named the Dao of Heavenly Treasures**\nAids the generations after the Three Dynasties.\n\n**The Seven and Ten Divisions**\nThe wondrous scriptures of the Primordial Beginning,\nComposed in the Dragon Han era.\n\n**The Golden Patterns and Jade Writs of the Most High in the Purple Tenuity Palace**\nThe secret texts of the supreme sages.\n\n**The Vermilion Gold Writs on Azure Jade Tablets**\nThe *Jade Instructions of the Most High*.\nThirty-six scrolls.\nThe Ten Division Scriptures are all inscribed in gold characters,\nWritten upon jade tablets,\nTheir chapter titles recorded at the Southern Pavilion of Purple Tenuity in the Great Profound Capital of Jade Metropolis.\n\n**The Five Thearchs Receive the Talismans, Guiding the Three Luminaries**\nThe Five Thearchs hold the talismans,\nThe myriad mouths of the *Fixed Register*.\nThe noble one goes all day without seeing—\nEven when seeing, nothing is perceived.\nGoes all day without hearing—\nEven when hearing, nothing is heard.\n\n**The Transformation of the Profound Capital’s Orthodox Unity**\nThe Perfected of Orthodox Unity expounds *The Thousand Perfected Disciplinary Scriptures*.\nThe Most High is wordless;\nThe noble one goes all day without speaking—\nEven when speaking, nothing is conveyed.\nThose who excel in transmission must grasp its words,\nMust grasp its meaning.\nThe Perfected listen with spirit—\nSuch listening is venerable.\nThe Sage teaches with the body—\nSuch teaching is precious.\nThe traces of the Sage may vanish, but the Yellow must endure;\nYou have yet to distinguish this.\nWords may lack what is certain, yet what is certain must exist;\nYou have yet to decide this.\n\n**The Dao has truth and falsehood; fortune has misfortune and good fortune. Offenses have public and private; clarity has fine and subtle distinctions.** The Three Worlds’ immortals—Ji Facheng and others—**observe rank in their dealings, the worthy and foolish overthrow one another, good and evil reveal each other.** There is no \"other,\" no \"self\"; no going, no coming. **Encompassing the ten thousand kalpas, all empty space—even the numberless stars of the constellations—are as I, since attaining the Dao and becoming immortal, have likewise been.** Empty space cannot be measured by steps, yet one who knows its mileage—so too is my lifespan. **Taking the Dharma as the source—*Dongxuan* and *Shengxuan* are both of this.** The beings of Heaven and Earth **originate entirely from the Dao, the essence and radiance of primordial chaos, the subtlest mystery of the Supreme Profundity.**\n\n**Silent contemplation:** neither empty nor not-empty, neither Dharma nor not-Dharma, neither thing nor not-thing, neither person nor not-person, neither cause nor not-cause, neither effect nor not-effect, neither beginning nor not-beginning, neither end nor not-end. **Lucidly** behold the perfected Primordial True One.\n\nThe two halves make one—being and non-being are the two halves, neither being nor non-being is the true and correct Way. Depart from these four halves and return to ascend the non-vacuous. Realizing non-being is not non-being, knowing being is not being, one dwells securely in the city of the Middle Way’s right contemplation. Turning back to my two halves, abiding in spontaneity, the Dao’s work renews daily, thoughts accumulate in benefit, and the Dharma-heart is seen, the heart’s form mutually perceived.\n\n**Drawing the Dao forth:**\nA pure breeze sweeps away the dust of worldly cares.\n\n**The Most High again sounds the Heavenly Drum thirty-six times.**\nLooking up to heaven, he invokes:\nMountains and rivers, all waters and lands, every hidden spirit,\nthe demon kings of the Three Realms, the demon kings of the Six Palaces,\nkings and princes of states—whoever can receive and uphold this scripture\nshall be joined in strength and together treasured and protected.\n\n**Within formless primordial chaos, before the separation of heaven and earth:**\nWhat Heaven repays comes not swiftly yet is swift; what is sought through resonance arrives without movement.\n\nThe Golden Portal’s Supreme Sage commanded the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, dispatching the Jade Lad of the Supreme Profundity and the Orthodox Unity, Wang Zhong, Bao Qiu, and others, to present to Mao Ying the four-jointed *Yantai Luminescent Divine Mushroom*, the *Ever-Radiant Flying Night-Glowing Grotto Grass*, bearing seals and wearing robes and caps, all facing north to complete the rite.\n\nThe four messengers addressed Ying:\n“He who consumes the four-jointed *Hidden Mushroom* of the Great Ultimate shall be ranked as a Perfected Minister;\nhe who consumes the *Yantai Jade Mushroom* of the Golden Portal shall be ranked as Controller of Destinies;\nhe who consumes the *Flowing Brilliance Golden Essence* of the Eastern Palace shall be ranked as Controller of Prosperity;\nhe who consumes the *Ever-Radiant Flying* shall be ranked as Perfected Earl;\nhe who consumes the *Night-Glowing Grotto Grass* shall be ranked as Master of the Left and Right Censors’ Office.\nYou have consumed them all—your lifespan shall be as heaven and earth, and your rank shall be Controller of Destinies, Supreme Perfected of the Eastern Peak, Minister of the Upper Court, commanding the immortals of Wu and Yue, and overseeing the mountain sources of Jiangzuo.”\n\nIn an instant, the Five Emperors each arrived riding chariots of their directional colors, descending from the Weaving Palace to receive the Great Emperor’s command, appointing Ying as Controller of Destinies and Supreme Perfected Lord of the Eastern Court. The decree was inscribed on purple jade, its text reading:\n*“From his youth, Ying roamed the northern mountains with unbound hair, his heart summoning the Supreme Emperor, moved by the Great Profundity to devotion. Now he is appointed Perfected of the Great Profundity, Divine Lord Controller of Destinies. His conduct is firm as metal and stone, his cinnabar heart steadfast among the multitudes—now he is rewarded with the Jade Yue, the Green Banner, and the Eight Might’s staff, to subdue the sources of marshes and vanquish the myriad spirits. He once dwelt in the cold valleys of Eastern Grove—now he is rewarded with the Purple Tassel’s staff, the Lotus-Blossom Crown, to summon a thousand spirits and command clouds upon the mountains. He forsook his home to wander alone—thus he is granted the embroidered feathers, the purple mantle, the cinnabar and azure flying skirts, to ascend the celestial steps at ease, bearing the mandate of the Jade Perfected. He traversed deep thickets—thus he is rewarded with the Spotted Dragon’s chariot, the White Tiger’s plow, to float in revelry through the great void, his flying wheels gracing the imperial court. He endured frost and snow—thus he is granted the Curved Dawn’s precious canopy, the Jasper Curtains, the Crimson Chamber, to roam and gaze upon the Nine Palaces in serene warmth. He concealed his form in secluded peaks, his spirit contemplating the myriad groves—thus he is rewarded with the Divine Flowing Fire Bell, the Twin Pearls of Bright Moon, to ascend and report to the Great Ultimate, to convey his voice to the Supreme Clarity. His true heart is lofty and still—thus he is granted the brocade banner, the embroidered pennant, the white feathered black staff, to summon the Six Yin and the Jade Maidens to attend his carriage. His kindness extends to all things, his hidden virtue governs the myriad beings—thus he is rewarded with the Phoenix’s flute, the golden bell, the jade chime, to harmonize the spirits in the empty halls, to delight the Perfected and dance with the numinous. No being can disrupt his resonance, no thousand evils can enslave his purity—thus he is rewarded with the Purple Essence’s marrow, the Jade Nectar, the Golden Infant, to share the lifespan of the Three Luminaries, to inscribe his name upon the Cinnabar Jade. Ying’s heart shines with the radiance of the sun, his spirit leaps with the great aurora—he has redeemed the longevity of others, thus he is styled ‘Great Profundity.’ With the nine virtues complete, he is now instructed in nine affairs, granted forty Jade Boys and forty Jade Maidens to attend his comings and goings in the Great Reverence, to receive affairs from the Great Ultimate, and to govern the office of the Red City Jade Grotto’s府. His movements and stillness shall be reported.”*\n\nYing prostrated himself to receive the decree, bowing twice to the Perfected of the Great Profundity.\n\n**The Inner Transmission of Lord Mao**\n\n**Before Heaven and After Heaven:**\nOne beginning, one end—minor kalpas and great kalpas.\n\n**Merits inscribed on jade tablets:**\nAscension to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nSeeking to overturn the bitter sea,\nEver cause the river of desire to run dry.\nThe Dao has no form or shape—\nIt borrows words and images as its ford.\n\nHarmony is the source of all affairs.\nTrue rectitude within rectitude:\nDispelling what is to be dispelled,\nAttaining what is to be attained—\nBoth reliance and relinquishment are forgotten,\nThe mind vanishes in what it forgets.\n\nKnocking my head at the window of scripture masters,\nI beg to unseal the gate of the Double Mystery.\nAll open the true mark,\nAll enter the Mystery Gate—\nLike the Jade City of the Dark Capital,\nOpened through eight gates,\nWhere people of the eight directions each enter through their gate.\n\nThe heavens are vast and boundless,\nMyriad paths all return to one.\nThe Two Exhaustions—\nStill the realm of the two deaths:\nWithin lies the death-realm of the great appointed end,\nWithout, the death-root of thought-moment after thought-moment.\n\n*The Record of the Supreme Ultimate and the Immortal Duke’s Daily Observances*\n\nTranscending the two death-realms,\nSurpassing the three foundations of the Three Clarities—\nThe Heavenly Elder posed a question.\n\nThe dark name is inscribed on the green register and white tally:\nThe wondrous Dao of yin and yang,\nThe supreme art of ingestion and adornment—\nAll are divine formulas and secret instructions.\n\nWhat you heard before was not yet true seeing;\nWhat you hear now is true hearing.\n\nAbove heaven, below heaven.\n\nAll attain radiance, the earth becomes lapis lazuli and the seven treasures. Along the roads stand rows of trees, each side identical, and beneath every tree stand jade maidens and immortal youths, holding fragrant flowers in their hands. In the empty void, divine immortals perform myriad forms of music and dance. Within each land resides the Supreme Divine Lord, seated upon a golden couch within a seven-jeweled terrace.\n\nThe *Sutra of the Wondrous Dharma Wheel* emerges from boundless eons, vast as the kalpas of the Ganges, its brilliance shining like stars across the cosmos. This sutra is like the moon’s full radiance, illuminating the ten directions; as the three realms lie in darkness, this sutra rises like the sun, universally illuminating all heavens. Like the flow of ten thousand rivers, this sutra is the abyss of the Scorching Valley, the source of the Lü Sea, to which all return; like the height of Mount Sumeru, this sutra is the Jade Capital Mountain, encompassing all.\n\nAbove, it governs the Three Luminaries; in the middle, it harmonizes yin and yang; below, it unfolds the myriad lives. Those who cultivate this sutra without weariness will swiftly summon the dragon chariot and ascend in broad daylight.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* speaks of its virtue: like spring, it gives life to the myriad things; like summer, it nurtures and ripens them; like autumn, it brings them to majesty. Its virtue is like the seven treasures, prized by all things; like a bright mirror, reflecting the myriad things; like a great kingdom, lacking nothing; like a mountain, upon which all things depend; like the sea, containing all things; like the moon, casting its light upon all things; like the sun’s rays, illuminating all things. Its virtue is like the earth’s thickness, bearing the myriad things; like heaven’s vastness, covering all. Thus it pervades heaven and earth, giving rise to the four seasons. The upper scripture is heaven, the lower scripture is earth.\n\nThe heart is like lapis lazuli—\nThe Supreme resolves all doubts.\nAbove, nothing is unilluminated;\nBelow, nothing is unpenetrated.\nPenetration reaches the numinous.\n\nThe *Numinous Treasure* spans the great Dharma Bridge,\nRevealing the Dao,\nGuiding with the Dharma,\nTo deliver beings from the Three Calamities and Eight Difficulties.\nIt opens the gates of sweet dew and immortality,\nExtending my entry into the Dharma,\nAbiding in the chamber of non-action.\n\nThe Mind-King\nDwells in the city of the Middle Way,\nWith Dharma as its sincere teaching,\nForming the walls and moats of the Dharma.\n\nThe Three Supreme Dharmas—\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, Xu Laile, gathers the assembly.\nAll the great sages of the heavens convene at Penglai.\nBowing before the Dao,\nThe Supreme Lord of the Dao sits upon a jeweled lotus,\nFlanked by tens of thousands of jade maidens and immortal youths.\n\nThe Lord of the Dao wears a nine-colored feathered robe,\nA gown of flying frost and floating pearls,\nA crown of ten thousand transformations,\nA belt with the Morning Sun Sword and the Bell of the Sun.\nThe dark chant resounds in four directions,\nThe phoenix’s wings stir with a single stroke,\nDragon patterns gleam in the azure abyss,\nCrimson splendor shines upon rivers and marshes,\nThe pheasant’s celestial form adorns orchid and jade,\nGolden essence emerges from secluded valleys.\nRiding the Great Compliance to command the supreme image,\nRoaming the pure spirit to merge the Five Turbidities,\nEmptily emitting the Nine Falls,\nProfoundly feasting the Nine Awakenings,\nDancing with shadows to fan the void,\nRiding the void to grasp the mist.\n\nThrough the cultivation of the Ten Practices,\nWith all lamps and torches,\nIlluminating the darkness of evil,\nJourneying toward the royal city.\n\nAmidst the surging clouds of the Great Dharma,\nA single chariot of sweet dew descends,\nDharma’s sprouts arise along the Dao’s path.\nThe One Flavor rains upon the Ten Directions,\nThe Two-by-Two Dharma Seal\nEstablishes my Dharma Gate.\nThe Palace of Undying—\nThe Southern Pole’s Songling Palace.\nThe Great Dharma of human-making,\nThe world’s finest physician.\nThe Numinous Treasure’s First Gate—\nThe stairway of virtue and practice.\nEnter its gate, and the Dao’s chambers may be fathomed;\nAscend its steps, and merit and achievement grow daily.\n\nFrom ancient past to present—\nThe True One’s natural Dao.\nMost subtle, most wondrous, most profound, most mysterious,\nNeither being nor non-being, neither mortal nor sage,\nWisdom serves as the boat and oar,\nShaking off the Ten Entanglements.\nAscend the ever-abiding shore,\nWhere celestial wondrous blossoms rain—\nThe blossoms of the Kānā Forest.\nStrike the music of the Heavenly Musicians—\nThe melodies of Heavenly Hooks.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate and Great Void Perfected One\nAddressed the Left Immortal Duke, saying:\n\"Formerly, I received from the Most High Golden Sun\nThe True One’s Ascending Mystery Inner Teaching,\nThe First Gate of the Primary Gate,\nPracticed by the Five Thearchs.\nThis scripture is the parent of all karmic deeds of the Perfected Ones—\nThe *Hidden Writ of Jade Purity*.\n\n**The Master-Disciple Rank, Second**\nWithout a master, one does not proceed;\nWithout a master, one is not born;\nWithout a master, one is not delivered;\nWithout a master, one does not ascend as an immortal.\nThe Eightfold Radiance Dragon Chariot—\nTherein one may

Zhongshan,\nWhere sweet dew, purple mushrooms, luminous pearls,\nAnd the triple confluence of dragon blossoms\nSprouted at his resting place.\nHis mother conceived by the white dew’s touch.\nAt fourteen, he served the Duke of Xigui as minister,\nFearing neither Yi nor Ju,\nAnd studied under Master Huanggu.\nLater, he encountered the Jade Purity’s Wenchang,\nThe Eastern Jade Radiance Immortal Duke,\nAnd was styled the Jade Sovereign.\n\nThe Second Dao Lord bestowed the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*.\nAll ghosts shun the Three Caverns Dharma Master—\nThose who receive the Three Caverns

Dexuan, having ingested the *Six Jia Spirit-Flight Talisman*, could traverse over three thousand *li* in a single day.\n\n**The Four Transformative Talismans**\nIn spring, ingest the *Eastern Brilliance Communion-with-the-True Transformative Radiant Yang Mist Talisman*;\nIn summer, ingest the *Southern Radiance Eightfold-Refinement Elixir Transformative Fourfold Clarity Talisman*;\nIn autumn, ingest the *Western Essence Vast-Spirit Transformative Radiance Talisman*;\nIn winter, ingest the *Northern Mystery Profound-True Refinement Transformative Whistling Wind Talisman*.\n\nTo practice the Way of the Yellow Emperor, ingest the *Yellow Supreme Eight Scriptures Life-Radiance Jade Gate Talisman* on the days of the *li* months.\n\n**Eastern Brilliance Communion-with-the-True Talisman**\nThe essence of the Eastern Azure Radiant Yang Mist, *Opening Brilliance and Communing with Light*, is the primal glow of the origin’s dawn, illuminating the Eastern Heaven. It surges through ninety-nine myriad million layers, where flocks of jade-green fowl perch in verdant groves. Above lies the *Origin Azure* abode; within stands the *Azure Splendor* palace. The abode is graced by the *Nine Qi Primordial Elders*; the palace houses the *Azure Perfected Sage Lords*. To their right attend the *Azure Waist Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Kingfisher-Feather Divine Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of Mount Tai, driving and guiding the nine-light divine dragons. In the third month of spring, they descend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens, congealing qi into names and condensing essence into talismans. He who swallows this qi may instantly establish a divine body; he who cools this essence may transform into ninefold radiance—its wonders defy full description.\n\n**Southern Radiance Eightfold-Refinement Talisman**\nThe essence of the Southern *Fourfold Clarity* is the primal glow of the eight heavens’ trigrams, scattering through eighty-eight myriad million layers like flourishing auspicious clouds, resplendent in the court of the *Great Mystery*. Jade nectar cascades in the land of flowing fire, where the *Great Yang* holds the *Gushing Mouth* cavern, and the *Flowing Fire* abounds with deathless ones. Above stands the *Southern Culmen* terrace; within lies the *Cavern Yang* palace. The terrace is governed by the *Controller of Immortals and Life Mandates*; the palace contains the *Supreme Harmony Perfected*. To their right attend the *Great Perfected Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Vermilion Brilliance Divine Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of Mount Huo, driving and guiding the nine-colored phoenixes. In the third month of summer, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw the brilliance of the *Crimson Palace*. The two qi intersect in responsive transformation, their changes emerging from subtle glimmers. Essence condenses into script; qi congeals into stars. He who swallows this qi will have numinous lords descend to his chamber; he who cools this essence may soar through the eight voids, command the *Six Jia*, and dispatch the *Six Ding*.\n\n**Western Essence Vast-Spirit Transformative Radiance Supportive Talisman**\nIts script is the essence-qi of the Western *Vast-Spirit Metal Soul Sun Gate*, the primal glow of the sixfold golden radiance. Brightly it illumines the Western Rong, vast and flowing through sixty-six myriad million layers. Its essence falls like jade, driving light and streaming luster, pouring into the *Smelting Refinement* court. There lies the *Returning Countenance* pool, the *Refined Immortal* gem, and the *Gold Gate* with its azure-gold cinnabar. Above stands the *Dragon Mountain* divine tower; within lies the *Plain Spirit* palace. The tower is graced by the *Twelve King Immortals*; the palace shelters the *Western Florescence Perfected*. To their right attend the *Plain Spirit Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Gold Florescence Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of Mount Che, driving and guiding the *White Emperor’s* kings. In the third month of autumn, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens. The two qi respond and intersect, congealing essence into talismans and condensing qi into spirits. He who swallows this qi will instantly summon a divine countenance; he who cools this essence may soar through the *Gold Gate*, sit and summon the ten directions, and summon clouds to bring forth dragons.\n\n**Northern Mystery Refinement Transformative Talisman**\nThe essence of the Northern *Profound-True Whistling Wind Florescence Dawn* is the primal glow of the opening of yin and yang. Its radiance is chaotic, now merging, now parting, scattering and flowing through fifty-five myriad million layers. Its essence is profoundly interwoven, like the dark clouds’ distant smoke merging with blossoms yet unshining. It engenders the five phases and establishes the *Mysterious Beginning*, where yin generates the *Refined Immortal Jade Paste* and the *Cold Water* holds the *Demon-Quelling King*. Above stands the *Sevenfold Divine Flower Canopy*; within lies the *Crossing Spirit* hall, which shelters the *August Jade Dawn*. To their right attend the *Great Mystery Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Jade Dawn Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of Mount Da, driving and guiding the flying tortoises and purple wheels. In the third month of winter, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens, congealing essence into script and condensing qi into immortals. He who swallows this qi will have the *Seven Dawns* descend to his chamber; he who ingests this essence may reverse and transform yin and yang. Such are the wonders of the *August Numinous Script*.\n\n**Yellow Supreme Eight Scriptures Talisman**\nThe essence of the *Central Yellow Supreme Divine Mother Jade Gate Life-Radiance Communing Brilliance* is the primal glow of heaven and earth’s warp and woof, the twelve celestial stems. It illumines the eight directions, its mist wafting and scattering, its light brilliant and merging with the void. It surges and rises in the capital of the *Great Mystery*, threading through twelve myriad million layers, its flowing nectar overflowing in the land of the four seasons. Above stands the *Royal Capital* palace; within lies the *Leather Canopy* palace. The former is governed by the *Supreme Dao Lord*; the latter contains the *Wood Dawn Lord*. To their left attend the *Flying Immortals with Feathered Staffs* and the *Azure Florescence Jade Maidens*; to their right, the *Commanding Immortal Jade Gentlemen* and the *Golden Bell Divine Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of the *Nine Wastes*, driving and guiding the *Yellow Supreme* dragons. They gather the five qi to revolve the celestial stems, commanding the twelve *Polar Arrays*, ascending to guide the source and flow of the Nine Heavens, and descending to draw the yellow spirit of the spleen. The two qi intersect above the *Muddy Pellet*, refining and transforming in the chamber of the *Three Cinnabar Fields*. Essence congeals to transform spirits; qi condenses to refine immortals. He who swallows this qi will have the *Yellow Elder* descend in form; he who cools this essence will radiate the color of *vajra*. Myriad marvels transform, and one may soar through the Great Void. The wondrous efficacy of this numinous script defies measure.\n\nVirtue is the father;\nSpiritual illumination, the mother.\nPurity and quiescence, the teacher;\nSupreme harmony, the friend.\nThe horse and tiger are dragons,\nAnd one becomes coeval with heaven and earth.\nTo be mysterious and silent\nIs to exhaust the Dao.\nWithout goodness, one does not act;\nWithout harmony, one does not speak.\n\nThus, those who do good awaken of themselves; those who commit evil punish themselves. A heart upright knows no doubt; a heart pure bears no defilement. The Most High August Emperor refines the Supreme Perfected through ninefold refinement.\n\nThe mouth and tongue are the palace of calamity, the mansion of peril and ruin. Speech is the repository of great destiny, the domain of punishment and misfortune. When the sage speaks, he fears that his words may stray from the wondrous truth. Though literary eloquence fills heaven and earth, when the worthy and sagely speak—\n\nTo a lord, their words bring grace to the state;\nTo a father, kindness to his child;\nTo a teacher, love to the multitude;\nTo brothers, fraternal conduct in action;\nTo a minister, loyalty to his sovereign;\nTo a ruler, filial piety to his parents;\nTo a friend, trust in their bond;\nTo a wife, chastity to her husband;\nTo a husband, harmony in the household;\nTo a younger sibling, reverence in ritual;\nTo a rustic, encouragement in farming;\nTo a Daoist, rectitude in the Dao;\nTo one of a foreign land, each guards their own realm;\nTo servants and maids, caution in their duties.\n\nThe Dark Lord of the Northern Cavern, the Solitary and Uttermost, the Five Numinous Ones, the Mysterious Elder—his surname is Hao, his style Fuming. Scion of the Mysterious August, descendant of the Grand Clarity, at the age of twelve in the midst of the Azure Heaven, his heart delighted in mountains and waters. After a thousand days he returned, and beneath the Mirror Mountain he encountered a field of lettuce. He gathered it to relieve the destitute, yet after three years his task remained unfinished, and he perished at the mountain’s foot. The Nine Heavens inscribed his yang virtue; the golden tablets recorded his jade name. His ethereal soul was conveyed to the Palace of Vermilion Clarity, where the Emperor dispatched the Golden-Winged Great Roc to spread its mighty wings over his corpse. Seven hundred years passed until the water kalpa altered the cosmic tide, and his remains drifted into boundless depths. When the waters receded, they came to rest upon the Northern Black Mound. Thirty years later, a great mountain fire raged, and he was refined in its flames before rising again, a five-colored cloud canopy above him. The Primordial Beginning bestowed upon him the *Lingbao Crimson Writ of the Five Qi of the Mysterious Heaven*, the true scripture of the Black Emperor of the North.\n\nSome sold themselves to sustain the Dharma; some cast themselves before hungry tigers; some carved their flesh to feed the birds. Their utmost sincerity moved the Great Void; their hidden virtue harmonized with the Three Luminaries. The Most High’s *Ninefold Crimson Seals of the Five Thearchs’ Inner Perfected*.\n\nUnmatched diligence, no peer in devotion; the forests and peaks, the Dharma-wheel. Kindly opening expedient means, great compassion pervades all. Dispelling greed and lust, calming wrath and affliction, eradicating perverse folly, extinguishing the three poisons—these four deeds are the forerunners of the Six Perfections.\n\nMen and women each contend in their intentions; four horses pass like a crack in the wall—yet even this is slow. Compared to them, the fleeting question of a cloud is swift as lightning, yet neither matches the speed of thought. To master the heart is more difficult than taming tigers and leopards. Apes, monkeys, deer, and horses are all easily controlled. Only the supremely sagely can truly govern the heart.\n\nRectify the spirits, rectify the heart; rectify conduct, rectify the body. Heavenly spirits revere them; earthly spirits guard them. The discipline of cultivating the heart and entering the Dao unfolds in myriad branches. From beginning to end, steadfast in integrity, they guide in hidden transformation; in advance and retreat, harmonizing their light, they teach in secret practice. Eating but once at midday, they maintain purity in their person. Even gold must not be defiled—how much more the Supreme Dao!\n\nThe Three Wondrous Treasure Texts of the Supreme Nine Perfected Luminous Regulations.\n\nPlace a vessel of pure water, and two fen of true pearls. Write the Luminous Talisman of Penetrating Clarity and place it in the water, exposing it in the central courtyard for one night. Hold the water facing north, knock the teeth three times, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The radiance of heaven is veiled by vapors,\nThe five spirits are mingled with the true.\nCinnabar numina are all disordered,\nImpure qi fills the sky.\nToday, pure and auspicious,\nCease misfortune and reveal good fortune.\nThree parts adorn and reflect,\nFive mushrooms wash away dust.\nThe eight qi penetrate brightly,\nInterweaving through my body.\nAbove, white; below, yellow—\nWithin and without, luminous and fresh.\"*\n\nWash the hands and face with the water; it may also be used for bathing. Pour the remaining water into an eastward-flowing stream. All impurities will dissolve, the myriad perfected will abide in the body, and even after three transgressions, one remains unstained—thus cultivating the Dao of the Three Heavens.\n\n*Oral Instructions of the Azure Lad:*\nIn the realm of the living, purity is scarce and turbidity abundant; one should wear the tattered talisman. The qi of the Nine Heavens transforms into nine phoenixes, each guarding the body, soaring through the Three Realms, drawing the wondrous qi of the Three Clarities, and sweeping away the dust and clamor of the Nine Lands.\n\nThe *Supreme Azure Prime Upper Record* states:\n*\"Bathe with five fragrances at the three times.\"*\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months, as well as on ordinary days at dawn, noon, and midnight:\n\n*Qingmu* (cypress) leaves are divided into five segments, each fivefold in structure. The people of Tianzhu (India) say: the five fragrant herbs repel malign qi, stabilize the hun and po souls, subdue demonic entities, and summon numinous perfected beings. This herb grows abundantly east of the Canglang River, where the divine beings of the East each transform into *qingmu* incense.\n\nWhen one burns *qingmu*, *xunlu* (frankincense), and *anxi* resin in the bedchamber, it dispels the foulness of the Five Turbidities and the demonic qi of the earth, which would otherwise rise straight up to the heavens for forty *li*. The smoke of this incense shatters the filth of turbid qi and parts the mists of evil demons. Heavenly beings and jade maidens, the Supreme Unity Emperor Lord, follow the fragrant vapors to rest upon one’s face and form.\n\nScholars of the highest learning ingest the radiance of the sun and moon, the flying roots of golden essence. The Way of the Yellow Qi: on the morning of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), boil *baizhi* (angelica), peach bark, and *qingmu*, then bathe facing east. On *jiazi* days, one should bathe.\n\n*The Precious Divine Daily Record of the Queen Mother of the West* states:\nOn the first, fifteenth, and twenty-third days of each month, draw water from three rivers (or three wells, as some say). Measure the water in a *hu* vessel, then boil one *liang* each of *jishe* (clove), *qingmu*, *lingling* (lemongrass), *xunlu*, and *chenxiang* (aloeswood). Inscribe the *Tongming* talisman upon the water and use it for bathing. First, face east and knock the teeth twenty-four times, visualizing the Seven Stars above the nape, a canopy of purple mist filling the room, divine youths scattering incense to the left, and jade maidens holding towels to the right. Upon completion, recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The Three Luminaries shine brightly,\nThe Five Spirits become serene.\nThe heavens bear no floating haze,\nThe earth stirs no flying dust.\nBathe in the Eastern Well,\nReceive and reverse your form.\nBody fragrant, bones aromatic,\nAscend to the Jade Court.\nHaving received the Supreme Perfected,\nCast the talisman into the well.\"*\n\nThis is the supreme method of imperial bathing, transmitted from the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning to the Heavenly Emperor of Unity. Through cultivation, the Emperor Lord attained flowing purple radiance to crown his imperial form. The Supreme Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen refined it to emit an upper fragrance heard across the Three Clarities. The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity cultivated it, and the divine mushrooms of the Five Directions gathered in his chamber. The Golden Gate Lord of the Supreme Sages developed a royal glow upon his face. The Prime Minister Azure Lad refined it, and his fragrance suffused the Three Clarities. This secret Way resides within the Purple Chamber of the Southern Culmen.\n\nBathing in the Orchid Pool above,\nDragons bear the long-handled vase.\nGolden youths scatter fragrant blossoms,\nJade maidens stream the Five Stars.\nCrown and sash washed in jade nectar,\nRefining and transcending the Five Immortals’ forms.\nBody fragrant, myriad spirits descend,\nRiding the light to ascend the lofty clarity.\n\nBathe at the Golden Gate,\nCrown and sash aglow with divine radiance.\nThe Jade Void seals the talisman,\nAll immortals converge in return.\nHeavenly officials and their retinues\nFeast and wander the Three Clarities, ascending the Dark Peak.\n\nThe Supreme Unity Emperor Lord regards the Purple Chamber as the Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, the Three Wombs as divine luminaries. The Eight Pure Ones adorn the Mysterious, with true contemplation as their foremost; the esoteric words and wondrous essentials are the *Inner Canon of the Nine Perfected*. The divine method takes pure thought as its deepest core, and the youthful adept takes thorough realization as attaining the numinous. The *Great Cavern* takes the exalted as its origin, the *Great Elixir* takes the Feminine One as its inner essence, the Five Elders take spontaneity as their morning bones, the Supreme Lord takes the Non-Beflowered as the Mysterious Clarity, the Yellow Venerable takes will and nature as the root of the Dao, the White Prime takes immaculate cultivation as entry into the real, perfected beings take qi-convergence as mutual refinement, and the essentials of immortality take essence-response as the completion of the Dao.\n\n*Jingzi* (Essence Son), *Chengzi* (Sincerity Son), *Shenrongzi* (Spirit Glory Son), *Zhongzi* (Central Son), *Hezi* (Harmony Son), *Daonaihuazi* (Dao-Transforming Son):\nSincerity is the gateway of the spirit. It accomplishes what cannot be accomplished, guards what cannot be guarded. Ascending the Mysterious—there is being in non-being, non-being in non-non-being. Neither being nor non-being, it circulates through the Nine Extremes. Proceeding without cease, contemplating without weariness.\n\nThe five viscera within the body correspond to the Five Peaks. Learning is like the midday sun—before study, all is dark and obscure; this is the first stage of enlightenment. In learning, one must be precise and cannot be unclear, then one may fathom the wonders of the Three Clarities. Confine a thousand evils in the prison of the Eight Wastes, seal ten thousand demons at the ends of the Nine Distances. When the heart is upright, heaven and earth cannot oppose it. Constantly guard the Nine Hun souls to seek flying immortality.\n\nThe Great Unity abides peacefully in the Six Dwellings,\nThe Five Numinous Ones guard the Three Mouths.\nThe Three Officials refine and harmonize,\nThe five viscera are at peace and inquire no further.\nSecure them with divine medicines,\nNourish the cloud-body.\n\nWhat scholars cannot learn,\nWhere others cannot dwell—\nthe true and spontaneous One.\nA tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a hair’s tip;\nThe smoke of ascending clouds arises from a spark’s flame.\n\n*The Regulations of the Supreme Perfected*:\nEvil accumulates and leads to death—\nthe suffering of death is lamentable.\nGood accumulates and leads to long life—\nthe joy of life is cause for celebration.\nAccomplish three thousand merits to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\nAccomplish three hundred good deeds to attain earthly immortality.\nTo learn the Way of ascending as an immortal, one must perform six thousand two hundred good deeds.\nWith surplus in cultivation,\nHeaven sends a cloud chariot.\nThose who magnify the Dao do not perish,\nAttaining deathlessness by their own efforts.\n\nThe Way of Great Compassion\nTakes saving others as its priority.\nWithout merit, there is no reward;\nWithout virtue, no promotion;\nWithout trust, no salvation;\nWithout practice, no immortality.\nThose who establish merit and virtue\nDo so for heaven and earth,\nFor the Three Luminaries,\nFor the emperor,\nFor the myriad people,\nFor ancestral generations,\nFor all beings,\nAnd for themselves.\n\nExhale and inhale primordial harmony,\nSip and rinse with flowing rosy clouds.\nThe essence of the Five Flowers—\nthe question of the Immortal Duke.\n\nThe *Mysterious Record of Immortal Bones* inscribes names in the Golden Pavilion and Jade Register. Those who, in past lives, accumulated five hundred good deeds and fulfilled them all may attain the Three Ones.\n\nOn the Eight Auspicious Days,\nThey pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy,\nOffering high vows to ascend the heavens,\nTranscend the Jade Pure River,\nAnd wander through the myriad heavens;\nMiddle vows to transform their forms,\nSummon the Five Spirits,\nAnd ascend through the Moon Gate;\nLow vows that the Four Poles receive their oral commands,\nThe Western Florescence attend as guards,\nCommand golden lads,\nLead the Five Elders,\nThe Eight Sceneries share the same chariot,\nThe Upper Celebrations converge,\nAnd the Five Vows unfold in full.\n\nIn paying homage to the celestial patterns,\nThere are eleven contemplations,\nFourteen merits,\nAnd true persons who serve as bridges for the world.\n\nThe *Secret Scripture* in the Palace of Great Existence above the Nine Heavens—\nFierce dragons and venomous beasts guard the Jade Pass,\nJasper phoenixes spread their wings,\nGirdled simurghs shade the mysteries,\nHosts of perfected ones feast in reverence,\nMyriad sages pay homage in chariots,\nJade steps and canopies extend into the celestial court,\nThe Great Emperor humbles himself before the throne.\n\nGolden perfection and jade radiance—\nAt dawn, sunset, midnight, and the quiet of night,\nThey pay reverence to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, beginning with the East.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Spontaneous Dao* is inscribed in cinnabar and gold on the Terrace of Purple Tenuity. Daily, the perfected immortals and sages circumambulate it thrice, burning incense.\n\nThose who receive and practice the *Supreme Mystery of the Cavernous Profound Scripture* follow the highest instructions. Thrice a month, they seclude themselves to pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning, the Supreme Perfected Venerable, and the True Kings of the Nine Heavens. On those days, they bathe, enter the chamber, burn incense facing north, and kneel to say: *\"I beseech the divine immortals to inscribe my name in the Jade Register.\"*\n\nBones grow marrow, flesh transforms into golden perfection.\nThe cinnabar chamber is infused with mystery, and purple mist arises within.\nWhen finished, they rise and bow twice.\nAfter seven years of cultivation, the true spirits manifest in form.\nGolden bones and jade names are engraved in the Azure Palace.\nAfter a thousand days of fasting,\nUninvolved in worldly affairs,\nThey hold fast to purity, incense, and precepts.\nUnsullied by the dust of the world,\nSerene in the six practices,\nWith hearts gentle and intentions profound,\nTheir names are inscribed in the Golden Canon,\nListed in the Nine Heavens.\n\nThose who receive the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Scripture* from the Supreme Dao Lord of the Great Dao\nMaster the Eight Winds of Jade Revitalization and wander the path of the Imperial Unity.\n\nOn Mount Shu, a thousand-year-old tree spirit\nEncountered three worthy men passing by who rested beneath its branches.\nFrom within the hollow tree, a voice spoke: *\"In past lives, my merits were incomplete, so I remain bound to this tree. I entreat you to visit my home and hold a three-day fast for me.\"*\nThe household then invited Daoist masters to burn incense, recite scriptures, and perform rites of repentance for three days.\nThereupon, the spirit ascended into the clouds, becoming a wandering immortal in the Radiant Empyrean, embodying the original conduct of the free-roaming immortals.\nTheir bodies fragrant and pure, now like gold and jade.\n\nWhen the Three Primes unfold,\nTheir virtue crowns the heavens.\nVirtue like the Great Void—\nFormless and boundless, the origin of Primordial Beginning.\nVirtue like the Great Dao—\nMajestic and expansive, the treasure of divine luminosity.\nTheir virtue like heaven and earth,\nLike the Three Luminaries, illuminating all heavens;\nLike the four seasons, nurturing the myriad beings;\nLike the Great Mystery, the capital of immortals;\nLike Mount Tai, stabilizing spirits and anchoring numina;\nLike the Great River, vast and unobstructed.\n\nThe Three Luminaries honor such noble conduct.\nEach year holds six fasts.\n\nOn one’s natal day, the Gengshen day, and the Jiazi day, the Most High dispatches Perfected Ones, the sages of the ten directions, and immortals to descend upon the Three Realms below, while all ghosts and spirits likewise descend. The numina of heaven and earth tremble in reverence. Those who practice the Dao, recite scriptures, and in the six periods of day and night focus their minds upon the Perfected—such devotees shall have their lifespans extended by the Director of Destinies, be spared the Ten Sufferings and Eight Calamities, and ever dwell in blessed lands, while their seven generations of ancestors ascend to the Heavenly Halls.\n\nIn former times, the Most High transmitted the Six Fasts of the Three Annual Fasts to the Perfected One of the Stone Chamber, the Ten Methods of the Sixth Month to the Heavenly Elder Perfected One, and commanded the Perfected One of Emptiness and Nonbeing, Laozi, to transmit the Orthodox Unity teachings to the Three Heavens Master of the Correct One.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first month (Upper Prime), the fifteenth day of the seventh month (Middle Prime), and the fifteenth day of the tenth month (Lower Prime)—these three days of the year, along with the third day of the third month—when the Five Emperors of Earth, the Five Marchmounts, the officials of the Three Realms, and all the numina of the water palaces ascend to the Two Prime Offices of the Mysterious Capital in the Three Heavens, the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Flying Heavenly Kings, the Supreme Jade Void Perfected Great Spirits, the Lord of the Boundless Dao and Most High, the Venerable Ones, the Southern and Northern Poles, the Eastern and Western Unitary Flowers, the Ninefold Numinous True Mothers, the Jade Maidens of Grand Harmony, the Southern and Northern Dippers, and the constellations of the heavens—all assemble in solemn array. The officials of the Three Primes, left, right, and center, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Ten Departments, the yin-yang officials of water, fire, wind, and the blade, and the examiners of merit—all tally the good deeds of heaven and earth, inscribing the virtuous in the Azure Register and the transgressors in the Black Register, each report submitted to the Three Offices. Those who follow the Three Primes’ rites of repentance shall have the earth spirits guard their gates, and the Three Offices shall protect and recommend them.\n\nThe Supreme Cavern-Real Three Nonbeing Fasts:\nUpper Prime governs Heaven, Middle Prime governs Earth, Lower Prime governs Humanity.\nThe Three Primes unite in perfection, corresponding above to the Nine Mysteries.\nUpper Prime lasts nine days, Middle Prime six days, Lower Prime three days.\nOn the day before the fast begins, bathe with five fragrances—from nine persons of the Upper Mystery to three of the Lower Limit.\nOn the day of the fast, inscribe the Golden Perfected and Jade Radiance tokens of the Nine Heavens and place them before the Five Emperors to summon the spirits and invoke the numinous.\n\nThe *Three Primes Three Grades Fast Method of the Great Perfected* records that the Five Venerable Elder Spirits and the Heavenly Emperor-Kings customarily gather on the Six Fast Days at the Mysterious Capital’s Primordial Yang Purple Tenuity Terrace in the Upper Heavens, where they tally the celestial reckonings and examine the movements of destiny. The Heavenly Emperors, the Great Ones of the heavens, the envoys of the sun, moon, and stars, the Three Offices’ examiners of destiny, and the great spirits of the Five Marchmounts and Four Watercourses traverse the world below, scrutinizing merits and transgressions. Those who cultivate the fasts shall have their merits recorded by the Three Offices and Five Emperors, their names inscribed in the heavens. Below, they may pay homage to the Most High, and their seven generations of ancestors shall all ascend to the Halls of Blessing.\n\nOn the seventh day of the first month, the Fast of All Heavens is observed. Inscribe names on yellow su tablets, erasing death and restoring life. The Great Sage of the Primordial Numinous Treasure of the Northwest Heavens, the assembly of perfected and venerable spirits, and the Venerable Elder of the Limitless Dao’s Imperial True Sovereign gather on the first day at the Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Capital, the Purple Tenuity Terrace of the Northwest Mountain in the Upper Heavens. They command the Northern Dipper to descend with the Three Offices to assess ranks and expose deceit across the world below. Those who uphold the fast shall have their transgressions absolved by the Three Offices.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Heavens and the Most High Lord Lao gather on the eighth day at the Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Capital, the Yin Primordial Terrace of the Jade Mountain above. They urge the Northern Dipper’s Controller of Demon-Slaying to descend with the Eight Poles’ Registrars, traversing the world below. On this day, those who observe the fast shall have their transgressions erased by the Three Offices, their names recorded in the Three Heavens, inscribed in the Registers of Immortals. Heaven and earth’s spirits shall guard and protect them, and the myriad calamities shall not afflict them.\n\nThe Sage of the Northeast Heavens, the assembly of the Most High’s myriad transformations and myriad births, the Divine Sovereign of the Upper Mystery, and the Venerable Elder of the Primordial gather on the fourteenth day at the Mysterious Capital’s Jade Mountain, the Azure Tenuity Terrace of Penetrating Yang. They command the Great One’s envoys and the Northern Dengdu’s lords to traverse the world below, overseeing the affairs of humans and spirits.

They command the Great One’s envoys and the Three Offices’ examiners to traverse the world below, observing and inspecting the affairs of heaven and humanity. On this day, reciting scriptures and burning incense, the Earth Office’s spirits shall guard and protect.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Southwest Heavens, the assembly of the Heavenly Humans, the Venerable Elder, the Southern Culmen’s Primordial Perfected Lord, and the Supreme Numinous of the Grotto Yang gather on the twenty-fourth day at the Vermilion Palace of the Jade Capital to review the Three Offices, the Nine Bureaus, the Five Marchmounts, Mount Tai’s twenty-four prisons.

The Great One and the Three Offices’ Nine Bureaus and Nine Departments’ exposers of deceit traverse the Five Marchmounts.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Upper Heavens, the assembly of the Most High of the Upper and Lower, Central, Four Directions, and Eight Quarters, the Venerable Lords of the Effortless Great Dao, the primordial qi of the Dao, boundless and without origin, formless and chaotic, empty and spontaneous—within the Dao, the luminous sovereigns of spirit and clarity, the myriad myriad billions upon billions, the countless hosts, the Venerable Lords of virtue and power, the celestial officials and great spirits of the immortals gather on the thirtieth day at the Seven Treasures’ Purple Tenuity Palace to pay homage to the myriad true emperors of heaven. They tally the great kalpas and the lesser kalpas of the hundred and six. On this day, they dispatch the Upper Great One to descend among them, the stars and constellations of the heavens, the sun and moon, the Armillary Sphere and Northern Dipper all descending with the Five Emperors, the Five Marchmounts and Four Watercourses, the Water Emperor’s examiners, and the earth’s spirits to traverse the world below. Those who cultivate the fast on this day shall have their names inscribed in the Registers of Upper Immortals.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery’s Upper Palace’s Northern Emperor on the day of Gengshen governs the rectification of the Three Corpses of Heaven, recording human transgressions and submitting them to the Imperial Lord. Those who cultivate the fast on this day shall have their names inscribed on the Azure Contract.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery’s Upper Palace’s Perfected and Venerable Spirits on the day of Jiazi dispatch the Great One’s Central Terrace’s great envoys to traverse the heavens and earth, inspecting the spirits. On this day, burning incense and submitting to the Three Heavens, they shall be appointed as Heaven’s Overseers and Earth’s Stewards, their names inscribed in the Jade Registers.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery’s Upper Palace’s High Perfected Great Spirits on the day of the Beginning of Spring gather the various venerable great sages at the Supreme Ultimate’s Upper Palace to tally the jade tablets and golden names, determining those worthy of immortality.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery’s Upper Palace’s Primordial Perfected of the Supreme Simplicity on the day of the Spring Equinox gather the various immortal officials at the Jasper Terrace of Kunlun to review and establish the Numinous Treasure’s true scriptures.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery’s Upper Palace’s Five Emperors on the day of the Beginning of Summer gather the immortals at the Purple Tenuity Palace.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery’s Upper Palace’s Three Officials of Heaven on the day of the Summer Solstice gather at the Office of Life’s Controller.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery’s Upper Palace’s Perfected of the Five Marchmounts on the day of the Beginning of Autumn ascend to the Yellow Elder Lord of the Central Yellow Chamber’s Cloud Court, gathering the immortal officials to review the world’s spirit charts and numinous medicines.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery’s Upper Palace’s Supreme Yang Terrace’s Perfected on the day of the Autumn Equinox ascend to the Supreme Clarity’s Numinous Watchtower, the Grand Tenuity’s Lodge, gathering the Numinous Treasure’s true spirits, the Most High’s Five Venerable Lords, and the Northern Culmen’s Perfected Duke.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery’s Upper Palace’s Perfected Assembly of Immortals on the day of the Beginning of Winter gather the immortal officials and jade maidens at the Terrace of Yang.\n\nOn the Winter Solstice, ascending to the Azure Radiance of the Eastern Florescence, they gather at the Eastern Sea’s Azure Youth’s Golden Opening, where the Prime Minister and the Perfected Great Spirits of the Ultimate review and establish the registers of immortals. Contemplate the spirit, record the qi, practice the methods, and ascend the names—these are the Eight Commands of the Most High for the fast.\n\nAscend to heaven without a cloud-ladder,\nStep through flight without stellar qi—\nYet compare learning without fasting.\n\nA day of pure fast adds ten decades to life;\nTen decades of pure fast add a cycle to destiny;\nA thousand days of pure fast add a century to years.\nConceal virtue, hide radiance,\nSummon spirits, seek response.\n\nThe Golden and Yellow Registers—\nthe solemn rites of the Numinous Treasure’s many fasts.\nSix methods of fasting:\nGolden Register, Yellow Rescript, Luminous Perfection,\nThree Primes, Spontaneity, and Cultivation of the Body.\n\nThe repository of separation and union,\nthe gate of opening barriers—\nthese are the offices for delivering the living.\n\nThe palaces of the Six Heavens—\nwhere names of the dead are cast aside,\nwhere the repository of opening barriers\ndelivers the body of the adept.\n\nIf there is wrong, immediately reform and repent;\nif there is right, steadfastly persist.\nInner and outer intermingle,\nvictory and defeat tilt against each other,\nbefore and after connect.\n\n*The Supreme High’s Chart of Predestined Fate*\nWash the heart, confess transgressions first,\ndispel faults, send away errors.\nDo not blame heaven and earth,\ndo not resent humans and spirits.\nReform virtue, cultivate the future—\nin three years, carve and attain transcendence.\n\nAccumulate goodness as ramparts,\nthe heavens’ net is like frost and snow.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns—\nunless born of the Jade Clarity’s lineage,\nall are conceived in the primal undifferentiated qi,\nbound to the snatching of defilement.\n\n*The Luminous Regulations of the Nine Perfected*\nUnveil the Three Luminaries,\nloosen the hair, knock the teeth.\n\nThen, purify with a hundred days of fasting, receive the precious scriptures, and first confess one’s own transgressions. Master and disciple together endure the trials of the Wind-Knife’s Elder. The hun and po endure ten hardships and eight calamities, the body perishes in the Dark Springs.\n\nThe upper-grade person is serene and desireless, like water facing a mirror—unobstructed, unburdened, unattached, unseeking. The middle-grade person thinks little and desires little, trembling with vigilance. The lower-grade person reveres and trusts the Daoist teachings.\n\nVowing to the Three Luminaries, encompassing the ten thousand kalpas, their essence remains unwavering and unyielding. Lord Dao of Mount Long vowed to serve as master for the five paths of heaven and humanity. In due time, the five sacred peaks and all mountains shall be leveled, the earth like flowing glass.\n\nThe Twelve Supreme Vows,\n*The Essential Exegesis of the Supreme Perfected Writ*:\nThe four movements harmonize, all vows are fulfilled.\nLight illumines the heavens,\nfloating clouds gather like mist,\nshading and veiling the profound mystery.\nIn concealment, they practice non-action;\nin dispersion, they pervade all under heaven.\n\nThe Five Vows of the Thearch:\nFirst vow: the body moves in unison with the Three Luminaries.\nSecond vow: the body dwells above the Great Void, within the jeweled chambers of the King’s Palace, feasting with the Jade Emperor by day and resting with the Mysterious Mother by night, quenching thirst with the jade nectar of the surging well and the red-flowered fungus, sating hunger with dragon embryos, jade fat, and the crimson fruits of the sacred tree.\nThird vow: the body generates seventy-two radiant lights of myriad forms, with extraordinary hair and bones, entering and departing the imperial palace, drawing blessings in abundance, enjoying boundless longevity.\nFourth vow: to live and die with qi, to die and be reborn again, to be enfeoffed over the ten heavens and govern the host of immortals.\nFifth vow: to ensure that all beings, along with the sun, moon, and Three Luminaries, and those of the Dao, together with their seven dark and nine ancestral kin, ascend to the Southern Palace.\n\nThe Four Directions’ Five Vows converge in the Hall of Blessings.\n\nOn the first day of the first month, when the sun is aligned with the Celestial Thearch of the Great Tenuity, one should pray to the Heavenly Net and Earthly Web, saying:\n*\"As I wander alone through the nets of the ten directions and nine heavens above, dare any ensnare my body? As I roam through the webs of the ten directions and nine earths below, dare any entangle my form? As I ascend to the Supreme High, entering the feast in the Palace of Flowing Springs and the Curved River, let not my hun be detained.\"*\n\nReverently observe the charts and texts, perform the morning rites with solemnity.\nVisualize the Perfected Lord of the Great One\nwithin the Chamber of Mysterious Cinnabar.\nClad in swan’s down,\nascend to the Great Clarity.\nVisualize the sun and moon upon the face,\nentering the Grotto Chamber and Golden Flower Palace through the nostrils,\ntheir radiance emerging from behind the neck,\nforming a nine-colored halo that gently enters the Jade Pillow.\nThe sun enters from the left nostril, the moon from the right.\n\n*The Precious Esoteric Instructions of the Supreme Ultimate*:\nVisualize the descent of the Dao’s spirit, the jade countenance and golden visage.\nHeart and appearance align—\nthis is called the Capital of the Great Mystery,\nwhere the eyes behold the Jade Capital Mountain within the hall.\n\nBo Chengzi, Guang Chengzi, Qing Zhenzi, and Gu Xizi\ncontemplate the qi of the Dipper’s stars,\nmerging with the body into the lotus seed.\nSuddenly, they perceive within the lotus a jade mountain spanning a thousand leagues,\npalaces stretching ten thousand acres,\ncrimson trees laden with fruit beneath cloud-touched canopies,\npurple blossoms sprouting from fungi,\nazure brushstrokes on a yellow ground,\nthe Three Simplicities and Eight Wheels.\nThe Four Masters roam without realizing they are atop the lotus seed.\n\nOnce the five contemplations are established,\nthe form of the Dao appears.\nWhere the Dao abides, the ten thousand things are discerned;\nwhere the Dao transforms, the ten thousand things converge.\nTo think of spirits is to govern spirits,\nto think of the real is to attain the real,\nto think of immortals is to attain immortality,\nto think of the Dao is to govern the Dao,\nto think of abundance is to govern abundance.\nThe essence of the sage is to think of the worthy and govern the worthy.\nWhen one’s thoughts summon aid, it is granted.\nIf thoughts persist unbroken,\na scattered mind brings a thousand anxieties.\nTwelve contemplations,\ntwelve rewards.\n\nThe Five Calamities—three calamities and nine tribulations—are guided by celestial officials and welcomed by earthly deities. Commanding the Six Jia spirits, they set the stars in motion. Summoning the Three Sovereigns, they dispatch ghosts and spirits, and life’s bones daily renew. With focused and silent contemplation, the Primordial Elder bestows the jade talisman in Nanyang; the August Emperor inscribes the purple name in the Cinnabar Numinosity. Engraved in the Western Terrace’s chambers, fixed in the Eastern Flower’s abode, they harmonize with the qi of the Three Simplicities. Gazing upward, one beholds the radiance of the morning lamp. The Eight Effulgences propel the body in ascent, circling through seventy-four directions. Grace flows through the nine marshes, and blessings surge through the mysterious and plain.\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Spirit Generation* arises from the soaring, arcane qi of the Three Caverns. Threefold harmonies form its sound, coalescing into numinous script. It unites the hundred spirits, concealing their inner names through kalpas. Reciting the *Celestial Treasure* illumines the light of heaven and earth; reciting the *Numinous Treasure* awakens the souls of the Nine Dark Realms from eternal night; reciting the *Spiritual Treasure* governs the ten thousand spirits; reciting the *Grand Unity* delivers the body’s spirits; reciting the *Nine Heavens* generates life. When one recites it once, the sound ascends to the Nine Heavens, the Golden Towers and Jade Halls, the Twelvefold Gates, the Purple Portals and Jade Pavilions, the thirty-six thousand barriers. The Grand Unity confers talismans; the Primordial Lord grants life. Jade lads and maidens serve east and west, galloping in dragon chariots to ascend at dawn to the Nine Heavens’ spirit generation.\n\nThe *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Its Virtue*:\nThe superior adept, upon receiving its rhymes, becomes a Celestial King of the Most High;\nthe middling adept, upon reciting it, becomes a flying immortal;\nthe lesser adept, upon reciting it, becomes a Wheel-Turning Sage King.\nThe Heavenly Emperor’s numinous chariot welcomes their ethereal spirits.\nAbove, it extols the new bestowals of the Primordial Lord;\nbelow, it celebrates the great compassion of the divine perfected teachings.\nThis path, when one supplicates the Five Chapters, the *Numinous Writ of the Great Emperor*, and recites the *Five Thousand Characters* ten thousand times, summons the descent of the Most High’s cloud-dragon in welcome. For those who have not yet departed, recite it thrice a month.\n\nThe *Supreme Ultimate’s Esoteric Annotations and Treasured Instructions*:\nOn the half-month, one’s fate-day, the eight solar terms, at noon and midnight, receive and recite the *Five Thousand Characters*. Entrusting one’s form to the Great Yin’s day, one avoids the trials of Mount Tai’s Five Offices and the hells’ punishments. Above, one is reborn before the Heavenly Emperor; below, one is reborn into the households of marquises and kings, endowed with perfect features and a spirit so radiant it outshines blossoms. In tranquil contemplation of the Mysterious Chamber, establish the Terrace of Blessings.\n\nEntering the chamber to recite the scriptures, all don the sashes of the Five Emperors, while the Four Offices and their retinues come forth in welcome.\n\nFrom the *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles*:\nWhen Yin Xi recites one scroll of scripture ten thousand times over a thousand days, his ears become keen of hearing, his eyes penetrating of sight. The heavens each present lotus thrones and high seats, celestial beings bear jeweled canopies to cover him, flying dragons roar, lions guard the gates. The divine kings of the heavens, possessed of the Five Penetrations, along with spirit-people, scatter flowers, burn incense, and make offerings.\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord expounded the *Great Wisdom Writ of Supreme Clarity*. The Golden Portal Emperor, seated in attendance, heard it and reported to the Azure Lad: \"This prime ministerial rank may be conferred upon Daoist practitioners.\" Later, he informed Chi Xianzi of the Southern Marchmount, who fell ill in the Golden Flower Mountains. As the saying goes: \"Heaven is lenient, but ghosts afflict with illness to disrupt one’s true nature.\" Though stricken, he chanted and recited, completing three thousand repetitions. The Great Golden Portal then made him the True Person of the Grand Hut. At the same time, all acclaimed his virtue, and his blessings advanced in threefold measure.\n\nThe True Persons of the Ten Directions\nattended the *Numinous Writ* in the Jade Mountains, pacing the void through the Five Peaks, where all the heavens came forth in welcome, praising his excellence.\n\nThe Dao is not to be prized—what is to be prized is the power to act. The dragon transforms the seven yin souls, the thirst-demons within the body’s namesake.\n\nThe method for restraining the seven souls:\nOn the new moon, the full moon, and the last evening of the lunar month—once each.\n\nFrom the *Purple Writ of the Numinous Book*:\nIn the Great Beginning’s primordial chaos, the Three Qi distinctly separated.\n\nThe Cavern-Chamber of Golden Splendor is called the Radiant Origin. The arts of restraining the hun-souls and controlling the po-souls, the methods for nurturing the spirit and cultivating life—these are recorded in the *Ink-Recorded Cinnabar Writs of the Most High*.\n\nThe Five Perfected stabilize and guard against external demons. The *True Scripture of the Grand Cavern*, the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Sovereign—none is accomplished without the One, none is perfected without the One. To unite with the One as One—this is the path of the highest of the high.\n\nFor those of the middle rank and above, one must visualize the Three Origins, give life to and stabilize the Three Offices. The Three Corpses will surely fall, and the Three Origins will again be wondrous. Diligently practice the Five Virtues, and myriad good deeds will accumulate daily.\n\nThat which does not live shall not live; that which prolongs death shall hasten death.\n\nThe One is where primordial qi arises. The One is the guiding principle of Heaven.\n\nIf you truly desire long life, the Three-in-One must be made clear. When hunger reaches the thought of the One, the One grants coarse food; when thirst reaches the thought of the One, the One grants broth. Though slow, it is not hurried—the One settles in its chamber.\n\nIf one can conceal and prepare, the One will not depart. Seek it without ceasing, and you will ascend to those Nine Chambers.\n\nHeaven can guard the One and cover without lifting; Earth can guard the One and remain still in its place. The mountains can guard the One and not shun cold or heat. The darkness can guard the One and flow without returning. If a person can guard the One, they will surely attain transcendence and ascend as an immortal.\n\nThe Guardian-General of the Precepts, the Twenty-Four Great Spirits, serve to protect and defend.\n\nBocheng Qinsheng inquired of the Way of Yunfang and the secrets of the Three Perfections. The Jade Emperor and the White and Two Purities are the Lord Emperors of the body, the primal perfected ones among the hundred spirits.\n\nNow, to assist the solitary and examine the upright, the Three Sovereigns settle within, the Great One preserves the embryo, and the Five Elders refine the essence. The One abides in the Cinnabar Field, where the Controller of Destiny guards life. The One dwells in the Crimson Palace, where purple qi bathes the form. The One is honored in the Grotto Chamber, where the Three Simplicities merge in radiance. The Cloud Palace of the Hall of Light, the Purple Gate and Jade Portal, the Yellow Watchtower and Golden Chamber, the Jade City and Vermilion Window—these are the inner abodes of the Imperial One, the treasure chambers of the Three Perfected.\n\nThus, the single scene of Yunfang blends spirit and human, ascending to Kunlun above and descending to the Pure Springs below. Cloud canopies rise in towering majesty, forests and bamboos flourish in verdant splendor. The Seven Numinous Spirits revolve, the Three Colors entwine, and layered towers of ten thousand tiers form mist in three years. The Jade Watchtower stands in serene emptiness, the Seven Gates lie in profound depths. Golden doors and jade cabinets hold the talismanic registers in five scrolls. The undifferentiated takes form—summoning yang and calling forth yin.\n\nThe Three-in-One is the numinous origin of the body, the root of life for the hundred spirits, the mountain source of fluids, the royal chamber of soul and essence. The stomach’s pool is square to receive things, the brain’s palace is empty and round to accommodate the perfected. Ten thousand hairs stand erect, a thousand pores generate breath. Virtue fills Heaven and Earth, rank equals the Great Mystery.\n\nAbove the space between the brows lies the Cinnabar Field Palace, where the Red Child dwells. The heart is the Middle Cinnabar Field Palace, where the Perfected One dwells. Three inches below the navel is the Lower Cinnabar Field Palace, where the Infant Brother dwells. These together form the Three Cinnabar Fields.\n\nThe head contains nine palaces: three inches inward from between the brows is the Upper Twin Cinnabar Fields; one inch inward is the Hall of Light Palace; three inches inward is the Grotto Chamber Palace; three inches inward is the Cinnabar Field Palace; one inch above the Four Halls is the Heavenly Court Palace; one inch above the Grotto Chamber is the Flowing Pearl Palace; five inches inward is the Jade Emperor. Above the Hall of Ultimate Perfection is the Mystic Pearl Palace, one inch above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme August Palace.\n\nAbove the space between the brows, within it lie the Yellow Watchtower and Purple Gate, the Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber. Together they stand guard. The Azure Chamber’s great spirit is named *Zhengxin* (\"Upright Heart\"), styled *Chufang* (\"Primal Square\"). Within the Cinnabar Field Palace, the Lord Emperor is ever present; within the guarded inch, the great spirit is ever present.\n\nThe Most High said: The reason the Perfected One values the One as the True One is simply this—it is the One alone. The One’s resonance with the Great Void stirs unity; the One’s transformations align with the Heavenly Dao in profound accord. The Upper One is the Heavenly Emperor of the body, the Middle One is the Cinnabar Sovereign of the Crimson Palace, the Lower One is the Primal King of the Yellow Court. The true essence of the One oversees and governs the fourteen qi within the body, corresponding above to the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Grand Tenuity.\n\nWhen true qi circulates in harmony, the two substances take form. The mysterious spirit blends and divides, the Purple Chamber lies in deep obscurity. The Upper One is the ultimate of the Perfected Emperor, the Middle One is the perfection of the Perfected King, the Lower One is the subtlety of the Perfected King. The Heavenly Sovereign attains the Upper One and becomes the August Ultimate; the Earthly Sovereign attains the perfection of the Upper One and becomes the One; the Human Sovereign attains the subtlety of the Upper One and dwells among the myriad subtleties.\n\nJuzi transmitted this.\n\nSu Lin guarded the Dao of the Three Perfected and the Primal One. He informed Lin: \"I have been summoned by the August Lord to serve as Grand Master of the Four Offices of the Central Yellow, governing the Northern Sea.\" Later, he left behind a single document, which read: \"The Five Pecks and Three Ones are secrets of the Supreme Emperor. After twenty years of concentrated contemplation, the Three Ones appeared. I now transmit this scripture to you. If you can guard the Three Ones, your name will be inscribed on the Jade Tablets.\n\n\"Should you abide in the Grotto Chamber as a Minister of the Upper Clarity and be further enlightened regarding the Three Origins to become one of the Five August Lords, the Golden Portal August Lord of Later Saints shall ascend in radiant clouds, traversing the Ten Great Forests.\n\n\"During the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han, he told his disciple Zhou Jitong: 'Yesterday, I was summoned by the Mystic Province to serve as Perfected Minister of Destiny, Grand Master of the Supreme Ultimate, and Marquis of the Central Office. Tomorrow, a cloud chariot with feathered canopies, drawn by dragons and tigers, accompanied by thousands of attending officers, will come to receive me.' That very day, Lin ascended to heaven, rising slowly toward the northwest, enveloped in clouds and mist.\n\n\"Thus, in the era of the Three Sovereigns, those who studied the Dao all prized the guarding of the One. One must make the heart uncarved and the spirit congealed, the body single-minded in sincere devotion. Let no hundred thoughts arise, and let essence and intent not scatter. If for three months one inwardly gazes and fixes the mind, a single spirit will appear, and the radiance of spirit will transform and coil through the five viscera.\n\n\"After the dispersal of the uncarved and the true, and the latent rise of florid falsity, the One fails to summon response, and spirits do not immediately answer. The method of the Three Ones is the first chapter of the true scriptures of the Golden Portal August Lord of the Upper Clarity of the August Heaven, the ultimate of the most exalted Dao, the ford of divine immortals, the wondrous formula of the host of Perfected. In all the myriad affairs of advancing or retreating in one’s person, one should constantly contemplate the One.\n\n\"Mud the nine palaces to nourish the po souls;\nWithin the Central Origin, embrace the One Palace.\nThe two numinous storehouses of the Cinnabar Field,\nMerge to give birth to the Spirit King.\nThe Three Passes govern the nine great [forces];\nInhaling and exhaling, the light of sun and moon.\nThe five stars nurture them,\nWhile the six ministers first flow and submit.\nIn stillness, the ten thousand qi return;\nSpirit at peace, the body too flourishes.\nThe Perfected of the Three Sections and Eight Effulgences,\nEscort me into the Grand Palace.\n\nTen thousand scrolls of cinnabar script\nAre not equal to abiding in the One.\nIn precious retreat, preserve essence and cultivate the celestial form,\nThat the myriad things may be nurtured.\nThe wise scholar transcends the transformations of thought.\nIn the era of the Upper Sovereign, people\nDeeply knew the ultimate essence of heaven and earth,\nAttaining the mind and intent of heaven and earth.\nWhen not studying,\nIt is like gazing in the dark at night—\nEast, west, south, north,\nOne strays beyond one’s chamber.\nRiding the wind and soaring through the void,\nDriving dragons and galloping through emptiness,\nOne observes the body.\"\n\nThe Pure and Profound Daoist Sect,\nIn silent contemplation, enters the Three Pristine Palaces;\nThe subtlest Way of the Utmost Dao pervades.\n\nTen trials, nine humiliations—\nYet holding reverent humility is the first wisdom.\nGuiding the Three Origins and Five Spirits is the second wisdom.\nCirculating through the eight directions,\nOne pure, one turbid; one sinking, one floating—\nThis is the third wisdom.\nAfter nine years of ceaseless turning,\nReaching twenty-four years at the middle,\nThirty-two years at the height—\nSuch is the fourth wisdom.\nTen thousand trials, boundless endurance—\nThis is the fifth wisdom.\n\nPerceiving form, perceiving qi, perceiving spirit,\nThe primordial origin of thought and reflection,\nRight perception and liberation.\nResplendent is the adamantine body,\nTranscendent, the Supreme Immortal.\nKnowing the real, one attains the real;\nDiligently seeking, one obtains the real.\nThe marvelous union of spirit and origin,\nIn serene contemplation, ever flowing.\nThe sun’s radiance transforms and moves,\nThe Purple Court illumines the body.\nThe Dao awakens to the Supreme Perfected,\nThe Seven Numinous Talismans penetrate deeply;\nThe divine mechanism becomes keenly perceptive,\nThe Eight August Ones establish the scripture.\nOne’s name is presented in the Imperial Hall,\nFeathered registers inscribed in the Great Origin.\nThe body reposes in the Verdant Chamber,\nSoaring through the Jade Void.\n\nExternal study may reach the origin,\nYet internal study naturally pervades all.\nGuiding the reins to ascend the luminous rosy clouds,\nFlowing essence shines upon the jade branches.\nGazing back, within the nothingness there is being,\nMerging as one with the infant.\n\nTreading warily as upon ice and blades, one ascends the Mystery.\nEmpty, empty—thus one naturally unites with the Dao’s true Unity,\nRecorded in the Supreme Perfected’s Purple Writs.\n\nShould you wish to ascend to Heaven,\nFirst practice the Seven Numinous [Talismans].\nHaving scaled the Northern Culmen,\nEnter the Purple Court—\nThere, inscribed upon the Northern Wall of the Supreme Ultimate,\nAre these characters:\n*\"At Xianyang, Mao Ying received the Step of the Unyielding Scripture from his master.\"*\nTested by fire that seared his robe,\nThough his mouth spoke not a word,\nHis countenance remained as the Celestial Hosts marching the Supreme Ultimate.\nHe ascended to the Upper Clarity,\nAnd now, ninety-eight years hence,\nHas been appointed Minister to the Thearch-Emperors—\nThus is the sincerity of discernment and acceptance made known.\n\n*The Jade Characters on the Golden Tablet of the Grand Tenuity*\n—Inner Transmission of the Lady of the Southern Marchmount,\nThe Purple Void Primordial Sovereign\n\nThe Three Realms and Six Heavens\nAre the domains of ghostly spirits, demon-kings, and their officials.\nThose who align with the Lesser Dao summon lesser spirits;\nThose who align with the Middle Dao summon middle spirits;\nThose who align with the Great Dao summon great spirits.\n\nThe Primordial is the origin of Heaven and Earth,\nExalted by the Three Realms,\nIllumined by the Five Thearchs.\nThe Five Palaces bind qi,\nThe Six Repositories generate the true;\nThe Nine Treasuries brightly reveal the Supreme Perfected’s Nine Crimson-Speckled Talismans.\nFathom the marvelous awakening of Heaven’s essence,\nSever all attachments to proximate thoughts.\nThe Feminine One and the Five Elders—\nA hundred petitions birth the realm beyond the absolute.\n\nScattering winds to harmonize jade flutes,\nFlying mists racing with six reins.\nSetting aside the myriad entanglements,\nOne roams freely between Heaven and Earth,\nBeyond the eight limits of the clouds,\nTo dwell as a neighbor to the Dao.\n\nThose who awaken first guide those who awaken later,\nTurning the current back to the One Source.\nMuch toil yields little gain—\nIn the end, this strays from the Great Vehicle.\n\nFourfold attainment:\nFirst, *ascendant attainment*—golden suzhou pearls and jade,\nSeven-jeweled palaces,\nEqual to the Jade Capital;\nSecond, *bodily attainment*—form and marks perfected,\nDiamond-indestructible;\nThird, *destined attainment*—lifespan’s length or brevity,\nEntrusted wholly to the Three Treasures;\nFourth, *sincere attainment*—fortune and misfortune, good and evil,\nSuffering and joy, self and other both forgotten,\nAscending beyond the Three Clarities.\n\nThe form of the Primordial Shape—\nThose who are virtuous can glimpse it.\nWisdom practices the Six Perfections,\nTranscending the Three Realms,\nDelivering from the nine shades of suffering—\nThus it is called the Six [Virtues].\n\nFirst, the power of diligence;\nSecond, the power of faith;\nThird, the power of quiescence;\nFourth, the power of perseverance;\nFifth, the power of refining cold;\nSixth, the power of renouncing wine and lust.\n\nThe *Sutra of Dispelling Demons*—\nThus one dissolves the Three Nets.\n\nBreathing nurtures the cloud-sprout.\nThose of the first attainment—\nA hundred words cannot cure them.\nThose of the second attainment—\nA thousand words cannot alter them.\nThose of the third attainment—\nTen thousand words cannot reach them.\nThose of the fourth attainment—\nThe ten directions cannot sway them.\nThose of the fifth attainment—\nA hundred methods cannot constrain them.\nThose of the sixth attainment—\nIn utter silence, vast and boundless.\nNone but these six may compose true scripture.\nAll outside the Orthodox Dao are called deviant texts.\n\nThe Six Penetrations—\nFirst, the eye’s penetration: *all-penetrating vision*,\nGazing upon the Three Honored Ones,\nUndisturbed by the five colors,\nNeither yin nor yang,\nNeither small nor great,\nNothing unseen.\n\nSecond, the ear’s penetration: *all-penetrating hearing*,\nReceiving the Three Treasures,\nUnobstructed by the five tones,\nNeither pure nor turbid,\nNeither sharp nor dull,\nNothing unheard.\n\nThird, the nose’s penetration: *all-penetrating emptiness*,\nNeither old nor new,\nNeither sinking nor floating,\nAll distinctions known.\n\nFourth, the mouth’s penetration: *all-penetrating void*,\nDesiring to taste the sweet dew,\nThe wondrous Dharma surpassing cinnabar,\nNo craving for flesh or strong flavors,\nNeither fear nor dread,\nNeither hard nor soft,\nNo action unperceived.\n\nFifth, the body’s penetration: *all-penetrating subtlety*,\nNeither broad nor narrow,\nNeither inner nor outer,\nAll thoroughly fathomed.\n\nSixth, the mind’s penetration: *all-penetrating clarity*,\nIrrigating the five spirits,\nScouring the ten desires,\nNeither noble nor base,\nNeither Dao nor worldly,\nNothing left unilluminated.\n\nUnstained by defilement,\nWith the supreme medicine, one heals the madness of burning deviance.\n\nThe qi of the Six Awarenesses\nEver flows through the Six Wisdoms—\nHeaven: *all-penetrating vision*,\nEarth: *all-penetrating hearing*,\nEast: *all-penetrating emptiness*,\nWest: *all-penetrating void*,\nSouth: *all-penetrating clarity*,\nNorth: *all-penetrating turbidity*.\n\nThis adept bears the jade-name of the Supreme Ultimate,\nAlone strides the Jade Capital,\nTranscending the Three Realms—\nHow majestic the office of the Celestial Mountain’s Immortal Lord!\n\nThe markings of the Mysterious Metropolis are no empty boast.\n*The Fundamental Vows and Precepts*:\nWithin the primordial lies the wondrous,\nRefining the false into the true.\nHeaven establishes yin and yang,\nThe Three Sovereigns.\n\nThe Heavenly Thearch Lord,\nThe Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen,\nThe Heavenly Thearch Lord of the Grand Tenuity,\nThe Posterior Sage’s Ninefold Mysterious Lord of the Golden Watchtower—\nHaving purified through fasting for three months,\nProfound contemplation stirs the Great Stillness,\nAccumulated devotion awakens the Supreme Clarity.\nThereupon, the radiance of jade halts its splendor,\nThe ninefold *mystic* scriptures coil in sequence,\nHidden mushrooms weave their blossoms,\nNight-born treasure-light arises,\n*Excess dissipates, clarity descends*,\nThe primordial Dao advances with its companions,\nSipping the nectar of Great Harmony,\nGrace flows through the jade tablets.\n\n*The Supreme Simplicity of the Numinous*:\nThe first jade maidens were not true—\nOnly the fourth jade maiden,\nUpon whose nose rests a grain of white jade,\nIs the true Mysterious Jade.\nThe Numinous Sovereign discerns your intent—\nThe Supreme Ultimate has inscribed your name upon the jade tablets,\nIn the Green Script and Purple Void’s palace,\nThe Golden Book and Floral-Bound Pavilion.\nYour name is carved into the cinnabar script of the Supreme Clarity’s brocade register,\nAppointed as the Supreme Void’s Primordial Lady,\nController of Destinies of the Supreme Clarity,\nFurther bestowed the title of Mountain’s Honorific,\nEnnobled as the Lady of the Southern Marchmount.\n\nHow majestic the virtue of the Great Perfected!\nHow still the cause of non-arising!\nA hundred rivalries smoke and rise,\nTen thousand currents branch and diverge—\nYet within the Mysterious, the virtue of awakening\nSelf-accomplishes the sage and Perfected.\n\nThe advent of the Great Cycle brings the Great Authority,\nFollowing the times, one receives the mandate of the Three Heavens—\nThose who serve as the world’s teachers all practice the Orthodox Dharma,\nReceiving the mandate of the Six Heavens.\nThose who serve as the world’s teachers all practice the Dragon Dharma,\nWhether great or small, each bears a heavenly mandate.\nAdapting to the world’s transformation, acting or concealing as the times demand,\nEvery thought resides in the heart.\nNine years of diligent cultivation make one a Perfected of the Great Simplicity,\nTransforming form and altering substance in a thousand myriad instants.\n\nTo augment or complete the scriptures invites profound calamity.\nThe *Langshu* states:\n*\"The Way of No-Nothingness abides not even a day,\nIts meaning reaches the utmost Mystery upon Mystery.\"*\n\nThe *Jade Capital’s Supreme Jade Sutra*\nIs the ancestor of all scriptures.\nThe Supreme commands its transmission to the Lords, Kings, Earls, and Ministers of the Immortals.\nThis Great Dharma is transmitted to one person every forty thousand kalpas.\n\nI, having received the scripture and attained Perfection,\nHave commanded the Three Accumulations to bestow it upon four,\nTogether with you, making five.\nThe *True One’s Natural Scripture and Oral Instructions*:\nAs a token of transmission, inscribe one copy of the scripture,\nPassing it to one, ten, a hundred, a thousand—\nYet the original text remains intact.\n\nThe *Fixed Resolve* states:\nAmong a million people,\nOne may obtain this text, possessing immortal scriptures and immortal registers—\nSuch is predestined fate.\nAfter forty years of study, transmit this text,\nEnter the famous mountains, wander the eight directions,\nAnd none among heaven and earth’s spirits dare obstruct you.\nThe superior adept ascends as an immortal,\nThe lesser adept attains liberation through the corpse.\n\nThe *Three Sovereigns*:\nThe immortal youths attending the scripture,\nThe Lords of the Immortals inquire.\nTo receive the Dao without reverence or mindfulness of the master\nInvites the Three Officials’ mockery.\nTo recklessly divulge it binds seven generations in the prisons of hell,\nWhile the self suffers the trials of the Three Evils.\n\nKings and lords who uphold the scripture\nPreserve their ancestral temples and secure their states.\n\nThe *Ninefold Subtle Supreme Perfection* transmits the *Scripture of Wisdom and Insight*:\nThe Grand Master of the Great Ultimate, the Lofty Immortal King of the Supreme Ultimate.\nTo transmit the scripture without faith is called transgressing the Dao of Heaven.\nTo transmit without proper lineage is to divulge Heaven’s treasures.\nPatterned after Heaven and Earth—what does not arise? What does not come to fruition?\nPatterned after the Yangtze, the Yellow River, the Huai, and the seas—what waters do not flow? What streams do not course?\n\nOnly when one bears the immortal countenance above,\nFilial piety within,\nAnd wisdom and clarity below\nMay one receive the scripture.\nA single moment of sincerity—\nHuman and divine alike respond in kind.\n\nFrom the Dragon Han era to the Crimson Brightness,\nThrough the long night of the Nine Dark Realms,\nThose who attained liberation—\nTheir names are all inscribed in the Southern Mound Palace, the Nine Capitals, and the Upper Registers.\nEradicating the qi of the Nine Yin,\nTheir names are recorded in the Eastern Florescence.\n\nGazing toward the Eight Paths of the Mystic Radiance,\nSeven revolutions of the Heaven-Weaving Scripture—\nThe Supreme Eightfold Simplicity Perfected.\nWithin a single heaven:\nOne becomes the Most High,\nOne becomes the Lord Sovereign,\nOne becomes Laozi,\nOne becomes the Heavenly Master.\nEmerging from the Three Realms,\nExternally aiding the Nine Heavens—\nThe Lords of the Immortals attain the Dao,\nThe Three Masters come to deliver,\nAs the Seven Jeweled Mountain is illumined by the sun.\n\nWith heart opened and mind enlightened,\nOffer fragrant oil, paper, and brush\nTo the field of blessings.\nO noble one of abundant virtue!\n\nOffering gold and treasures to present the Writ of the Perfected.\nOne Master of the Three Caverns—\nSurpassing the Yellow and Red Dao by eleven thousand.\nCinnabar radiance illumines the Cloud Court,\nPurple mist glows in the Jade Grove.\nResplendent, the Seven Jeweled Brush,\nDazzling, it sways with numinous sound.\nGong and shang harmonize of themselves,\nPure fragrance scatters upon one’s lapels.\n\nThrough accumulated Dao, one becomes an immortal of Tortoise Mountain.\nThe Cinnabar Sovereign soars with the Dark Purple Writ—\nBubbling Jade, unpossessed treasure.\nThe name of the True Dao:\nThe Emperor’s Chart and Jade Register.\nIn the distant heavens of the Nine Empyreans,\nWhite tablets and blue-green registers—\nThe Supreme Sage Lord receives them in the Nine Voids,\nBinding the Flying Dark Sash with qi’s spontaneous script,\nRecording the names of later students who attain immortality,\nInscribing them in the Hall of Vast Numinosity.\nNone but the Supreme Sages can comprehend or read them.\nAfter seventy years,\nThey are inscribed at the northern source of Kunlun’s secret cavern,\nEach character a zhang in size.\n\nThe Immortal Stair ascends above the Nine Capitals,\nWhere the Jade Register’s main ledger records the names of those who attain the Dao.\nThe student’s name is entered in the Azure Palace,\nYet without a gold tablet or jade script,\nOne cannot be appointed Immortal Attendant or Director of the Jade Bureau.\nThose who are diligent and reverent—\nAll have their names memorialized to the Jade Emperor,\nAnd the Three Primes and Eastern Florescence of the Most High then dispatch the transmission of their true scriptures.\nNone among the later sages and host of Perfected fail first to present a gold tablet to Eastern Florescence,\nOr cast a jade missive to the Upper Clarity,\nBefore receiving the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*.\nUnlearned disciples—\nTheir blue-green scrolls bear no name in the Gold Register,\nTheir jade ledgers no script of the Dark Writ.\nThey cannot unfold the divine scriptures,\nNor will jade maidens guard their bodies.\n\nThose who study the Perfected receive the *Eight Simplicities Scripture of Dark Clarity*—\nAll have the Supreme Emperor,\nTheir names recorded in the Western Florescence Palace,\nWhere jade tablets and medicinal texts are kept in the Purple Palace.\nAs True Persons, five thousand years before their birth,\nThey already possessed the Dark Fixed Register,\nAnd were destined to encounter this scripture.\nThe *Eight Simplicities* of gold marrow and jade bone,\nThe wondrous Dao of the Lofty Dark,\nThe secret scrolls of Jade Clarity—\nAll are conferred upon those of gold names and jade script,\nThe lofty immortals.\n\nThe Heavenly King’s Dark Mirror,\nThe Seven Sages’ inscribed scrolls,\nThe Western Tortoise’s fixed register,\nThe Eastern Florescence’s recorded names,\nThe Dark Chart and Emperor’s Tablet,\nNames inscribed in the Azure Palace—\nThe Nine Heavenly Kings dispatch the Four Poles’ True Persons\nTo bestow the imperial writs of jasper script.\nThe Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen—\nThe treasured secret writs of jade seals—\nWithout gold tablets or jade marrow,\nWithout names recorded in the Emperor’s Chart,\nOne cannot behold the scrolls’ sequence.\nWithout a gold name in the Orchid Terrace,\nOr cinnabar script in the Purple Chamber,\nOne cannot see its texts.\n\nThe Supreme August’s register of the people’s destiny fixes the True Jade Record.\nThe Three Heavens’ Orthodox Unity Masters wear it\nTo determine the names of those who attain immortality.\nThe Azure Lad daily declares:\nThe Heavenly Record manifests in the Azure Palace,\nQi and seasons are diagnosed in bodily form,\nGreen script shines in the Great Ultimate,\nThe heart’s spirit is rectified in the Purple Chamber.\nOne who has a name in the Gold Pavilion—\nTheir eyes possess sunlight,\nTheir teeth are green, their blood white.\nSuch a person is benevolent and delights in immortality,\nBright and keen, outstanding and transcendent.\n\nIf the Upper Clarity has a gold book and jade record,\nTheir back bears a mark like the River Chariot,\nTheir chest has recumbent bones.\nIf the Great Ultimate has cinnabar tablets and blue-green script,\nTheir hands bear the characters of \"accumulated person\" and \"inverted great.\"\nIf the Square Cauldron has a dark simplicity and purple name,\nTheir eyes have four rings with purple light within.\nIf the Grand Clarity has a jade register and crimson name,\nTheir voice has jade resonance, their mouth square, their eyes round.\nIf the Grand Clarity has jasper tablets and gold script,\nTheir belly is white-willed, their mouth emits purple qi.\nIf the Southern Culmen has cinnabar script and purple records,\nTheir head generates five qi, ascending to the layered clouds.\nIf the Dipper contains a dark jade register,\nTheir heart is cinnabar, their apertures purple,\nYellow blossoms encircle their stomach,\nTheir mouth exhales fragrant qi, their teeth overflow with jade liquid.\nFrom youth, they delight in gazing at the flowing clouds of sun and moon,\nAnd rejoice in the luminous images of stars and constellations.\n\nIf the Dark Capital’s Cinnabar Terrace has white jade and gold script,\nTheir liver is green, their sinews purple,\nTheir kidneys azure with patterned veins.\nTheir breast brims with essence, their body is fragrant and supple.\nIf the Three Primes Palace has jade missives and blue-green script,\nTheir brain is purple, their tongue brocade,\nTheir will dark at the temples,\nTheir intestines green, their marrow vermilion,\nTheir forehead square, their brow round.\nTheir yin possesses hidden bones,\nTheir apertures three barriers;\nTheir eyes emit flowing light,\nGreen essence congeals into liquid.\nTheir palms bear the curves of fungi,\nTheir teeth three-edged,\nThey cherish water and embrace mountains,\nTreasure their po and nurture their hun.\nAll who possess these marks are destined to become highest immortals.\n\nThose next have a dark mountain and black will upon their nose—\nTheir belly must also have a dark mound to correspond to that mountain,\nA red and black will.\nGreen bones...\n\nThose who delight in the fragrance of the Five Perfumes and are eager to study the affairs of divine immortals—\nThey walk like cranes and move like dragons,\nTheir necks bear growths, and they avoid resting their ears upon pillows.\nBeneath their morning-concealed lungs lies a blue *zhi*,\nTheir bodies bear networked patterns,\nTheir hearts are true, their gallbladders serene,\nTheir ears firm, their *qi* expansive.\nThe Dark Province also holds registers inscribed with golden names.\n\nNext are the Three Palaces of Mount Tai,\nWhere the Dark Record and White Register mark the land of the living,\nNot inscribing the realm of the dead.\nThe Great Yin’s records of life and death are kept in black ledgers, white scrolls, and cinnabar-bound bamboo slips.\nWhen the true tally reaches six thousand slips,\nEach person is inscribed in the land beyond death.\n\nMaster Jinglin spoke to Hua Cun:\n\"Now I see your essence—radiant as the dawn, luminous and resplendent,\nYour round spirit shines with layered brilliance,\nPhoenix bones pierce your brain,\nNine-colored jewel-lights,\nFive viscera bound in purple,\nYour heart bears bright script.\nThus, your form dwells among celestial mists,\nYour spirit communes with the numinous realm.\"\n\n*The Inner Transmission of the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign*\n*Upper Clarity Scripture of the Dao-Treasures, Scroll One* (conclusion)\n\n*Upper Clarity Scripture of the Dao-Treasures, Scroll Two*\n**Heavenly Rank, Third Chapter**\n\nNo divine writ surpasses the Three and Five:\nThe sun, moon, and Northern Dipper as Three,\nThe five stars as Five.\nThe Great One\nIs the celestial script, the Primordial Unity.\nHeaven covers, earth bears,\nAll things arise between them.\nHeaven and earth are the constancy of the Great Dao—\nHeaven’s constancy is the One Heaven,\nThe Dao’s constancy is the One Dao.\n*Qi* transforms into nine,\nThus there are the Nine Heavens,\nEighty-one heavens in all.\n\nHeaven has Three Mysteries:\nThe sun, moon, and stars,\nAbove which are the Three Essences.\nThe Heaven of Purple Celestial Essence\nAbides within the Great Primordium,\nThe *qi* of the Three Primes above the path of the Upper Radiance.\nThe Three Luminaries above\nForm the celestial script.\n\nDisasters have three ranks:\nFirst fire, second water, third wind.\nNothing under heaven is eternal—how could anything be unyielding?\nAfter the great transformation,\nWhen four or five suns rise,\nRivers and streams dry, the great seas run empty.\nWhen six suns rise,\nAll things perish,\nLike rendered fat.\nHeaven and earth shatter, yin and yang cease.\nAfter nine generations, life begins anew.\nA great wind comes from another realm, from between the sun, moon, heaven, and earth,\nBearing clouds to the Eleventh Heaven,\nAbove and below vast as two chariot wheels.\nFor tens of millions of years,\nHeaven rains, and the waters rise to the Eleventh Heaven,\nSurrounding it on all sides with great floods,\nHeld in place by encircling winds that prevent overflow.\nThe winds blow the waters for billions of years,\nGenerating thick foam that transforms into seven treasures:\nFirst yellow gold, second white silver, third lapis lazuli,\nFourth crystal, fifth coral, sixth fine jade, seventh giant clam.\nChaotic winds scatter these seven treasures,\nUp to the Eleventh Heaven,\nDown to the Thirteenth Heaven,\nFashioning the Ninefold Heavens,\nWhere the heavenly people dwell.\nLater, the winds blow the waters,\nAnd the foam congeals into seven treasures,\nGathered in the heavens to form Mount Sumeru of jeweled treasure,\nThree million three hundred thousand *li* high.\nAgain, the seven treasures—crystal and yellow gold—\nAre gathered to build the sevenfold city walls of the Sun King.\nAgain, two treasures—white silver and lapis lazuli—\nAre gathered to build the sevenfold city walls of the Moon King.\nAgain, one treasure—crystal—\nIs raised forty thousand *li* high\nTo build the abodes of the gods beneath the heavens.\nThe great winds govern and propel them,\nLike floating clouds,\nCalled stars.\nThe largest span four hundred eighty *li*,\nThe smallest forty *li*.\nAgain, seven hundred Mount Sumerus of jeweled treasure\nAre gathered on four sides to form eightfold treasure mountains—\nYellow gold, white silver, and the like.\nThe winds transform the remaining waters into thick earth,\nWhose foam hardens into adamantine mountains,\nSix million seven hundred twenty thousand *li* high,\nThe palace of the Three Sovereigns.\n\nThe Great Sage and Venerable Spirit\nKnew not of fifty-five heavens,\nBut spoke only of forty-nine layers of heaven.\nThe upper six heavens are lodged within the *qi* of the Dao,\nFor the Dao resides above the Three Heavens,\nBeyond the Heavenly Web.\nFrom the lowest, one attains the first heaven,\nNamed Yi Heaven, styled \"Luminous Clarity.\"\nThe highest of the Three Heavens\nIs named Supreme Primordial Ultimate Great Dao High Yi Heaven,\nStyled \"Primordial Upper Three Heavens.\"\n\nThe Jade Capital Terrace\nFloats above the Supreme Great Heavenly Web,\nNow present, now absent,\nNow existent, now nonexistent.\nThe Great Heavenly Web—\nJade and forest wings surge through the mysterious,\nSun and moon gleam with numinous splendor.\nFlying immortals ride emerald *qi*,\nMounting radiance and riding purple mist.\nLush and luxuriant, they emerge from the script,\nIn profusion—divine treasure immortals.\n\nThe Three Clarities’ Heavens\nLie beyond the Three Realms.\nImmortals dwell in the Great Clarity,\nPerfected Ones in the Upper Clarity,\nSages in the Jade Clarity,\nEach with their own natural palaces.\n\nThe Three Heavens:\nGreat Crimson Heaven, styled Great Clarity,\nIts cavernous emptiness *qi* connects to the lower rank;\nYu Yu Heaven, styled Upper Clarity,\nIts purple emptiness *qi* connects to the middle rank;\nClear Tenuity Heaven, styled Jade Clarity,\nIts jade emptiness *qi* connects to the upper rank.\n\nEmerging from the sea of life and death,\nAscending the mountain of non-leakage,\nArriving at the shore of the Great Clarity,\nReceiving the flow of the true Dharma,\nGazing into the four directions—profound and boundless—\nThus it is called Cavernous Mystery.\nThe ultimate within the gaze\nIs difficult to proclaim.\n\nPracticing the Way of the Jade Clarity,\nOne emerges with all the heavens’ immortals as an escort,\nAttended by jade lads and jade maidens,\nBearing five-colored banners,\nRiding purple clouds and driving twelve jade dragons,\nPhoenix songs leading the way,\nMystic swords following behind,\nThe Six Masters opening the path,\nFlying dragons flanking the chariot—\nA rank equal to the highest immortals.\n\nPracticing the Way of the Upper Clarity,\nOne emerges with the Five Constellations as an escort,\nAttended by eight hundred jade lads and maidens each,\nBearing five-colored banners,\nRiding a dragon chariot through flying mist,\nNine phoenixes wailing ahead,\nEight simurghs singing behind,\nThe White Origin opening the way,\nThe Supreme Ultimate’s victorious chariot—\nThus, among the perfected there are high and low,\nAnd in ascending the mysterious, there are steps and ranks.\n\nThe Great Primordium links to the Jade Clarity,\nThe Three Luminaries illumine the high and bright.\nThe Eight Winds revolve the morning breeze,\nGolden light crowns the celestial essence,\nJade splendor binds the Five Elders,\nPurple mist drives the celestial plow.\nRiding the *qi*, swaying through the mysterious chambers,\nYielding to the branches, emerging from the script.\nRoaming freely in the Upper Clarity—\nA hundred thousand kalpas are but a single day in the heavens.\n\n*The True One’s Natural Formula*\nRising in body to the Great Clarity,\nTranscending radiance and soaring beyond the purple dawn.\n\nTen thousand kalpas are but last night,\nA thousand pillars like the morning court.\nPrecepts and wisdom magnify the Great Primal Chaos,\nThe mysterious steps rise on the whirlwind’s lift.\n\nThree *qi* beget three—\nThus are the Nine Heavens named.\nThe root of the Nine Heavens\nHolds three as supreme.\nThe heavens of the Nine Heavens,\nWith the Three Upper Heavens, form the Twelve *Qi*.\n\nFirst, the Supreme Primordial Radiance, the Formless Heaven—\nThe Upper *Qi* of the Mysterious Clarity.\nThe Mysterious Brahma, Jade Void Heaven.\nThe Upper Void, Crimson Heaven.\nThe Great Brahma, Mysterious Origin Heaven.\nJade Emptiness, the Profound and Still Heaven.\nTreasure Brahma, the Formless Mysterious Wonder Heaven.\nCloud Brahma, the Flowing Essence of the Middle Primordium Heaven.\nThe Upper Profound, the Boundless Heaven.\nThe Great Brahma, the Mysterious Essence Azure Heaven.\nPurple Void, the Upper Primordium Heaven.\nThe Great Brahma, the Dao-Virtueless Heaven among the Nine Heavens.\nNine Spirits, the *Qi* Heaven.\nThe Nameless Utmost Extreme, the Brahma-Voice Heaven.\nThe Cicada-Silent Heaven.\nEmpty Brahma, the Central Heaven.\nThe Supreme Ultimate, the Boundless Purple Void Profound Heaven.\nVerdant Brahma, the Natural Heaven.\n\nThe Four Heavenly Sounds—\nThe Thirty-Six Heavens share their names,\nBorn before the primordial *qi* of the Hollow Void,\nInscribed upon Kunlun’s mountain.\nThe Highest Ones chant their jade scriptures,\nThe Upper Ministers gather their wondrous chapters.\nAbove, they mark the Mysterious Chart;\nWithin, they hold pure the Six Offices and Thirty-Six Sounds;\nBelow, they govern the Nine Lands and Thirty-Six Earthly Sovereigns.\n\nThe numinous chapters flow unimpeded,\nThe jade tones gleam with spirit-freshness—\nAll are the wandering songs of the Heavenly Kings,\nThe treasured scriptures of the Hollow Mystery.\nSix by six, their rhymes unite;\nFour by four, they align with the perfected.\nNine by nine, the emperors divide—\nThus are the Thirty-Six Heavens named,\nAbove reaching the boundless and infinite,\nBelow plumbing the fathomless abyss of the Hollow Source.\n\nNone among the flying immortals and transcendent perfected\nWho do not receive the jade tones\nMay wander and behold the boundless scriptures.\nThose who obtain the scriptures,\nWhose names are inscribed in jade books,\nWhose characters are carved on purple tablets,\nWhose records are bound in the Jade Dawn—\nAfter thirty-six years of carving,\nThey attain the rank of Upper Immortal,\nAscending to the Heaven of Primordial Radiance above,\nPlumbing the Nine Lands’ source below.\nLike silver, like jade—\nThey gain a body of cold-hued essence.\n\nThe Six Demon Kings of Heaven:\nFirst, the Crimson Void Heaven;\nSecond, the Supreme Clarity Capital Heaven;\nThird, the Vast Heaven;\nFourth, the Great Mystery Heaven;\nFifth, the Great Mystery Azure Heaven;\nSixth, the Great Clarity Heaven.\n\nThe qi of the Primordial Highest Jade Emperor of the Primal Cavern’s Great Non-Being,\nThe qi of the Crimson Primal Non-Being’s Highest Jade Void,\nThe qi of the Dark Serene Mysterious Pervasion’s Highest Jade Void—\nThough their years differ and their names vary, their root is one.\n\nWithout light, without form,\nWithout shape, without name,\nWithout color, without trace,\nWithout sound, without voice—\nAccumulated yang forms heaven,\nAccumulated stagnation forms earth.\n\nThe Three Qi are the honor of heaven and earth,\nThe Nine Qi are the root of heaven and earth.\nThe Three unite to perfect virtue,\nThe ultimate of heaven and earth.\n\nThe Five Phases array their positions,\nThe warp and weft of the Eight Poles—\nHeaven and earth’s length and breadth.\nThe upper qi is the Beginning of Day, its color true azure;\nThe middle qi is the Origin, its color true white;\nThe lower qi is the Mysterious, its color true yellow.\n\nThe qi of Supreme Harmony, the Great Obscurity,\nLies above the Nine Heavens—termed the Obscure Qi,\nUtterly remote and cut off,\nBalancing the Nine Mysteries.\nOnly by reciting the *Great Cavern Jade Scripture* may one commune with it,\nWhereupon the Jade Emperor mounts the Cinnabar Clouds to initiate the Dao,\nThe Great Obscurity dons green radiance and shines resplendent.\nThe halls of golden ramparts fill,\nThe courtyards of cloud-pearls receive the perfected.\n\nWithin the Three Primordials’ Palace,\nThe qi of Three Flowers arises,\nLike the radiance of hibiscus,\nMysterious hues in the void.\nWithin the Origin’s Celestial Cycle,\nThere is a Golden Watchtower,\nWherein dwells the qi of the Upper Effulgence.\nIts qi and color luxuriant,\nPurple mists swirl,\nIts brilliance illumines the ten directions,\nClouds shade the Golden Watchtower—\nThe gathering place of later sages.\n\nCondensed qi forms purple radiance,\nCinnabar clouds mirror the azure sky,\nSpread in the southwest’s turning.\nThe Three Mornings brighten the Seven Luminaries,\nThe constellations array the Grand Tenuity.\n\nThe Three Ones’ Primordial Lords\nEach possess true qi,\nForming a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders,\nCloud carriages and feathered canopies.\n\nThe upright qi of the Twenty-Four Spirits—\nScattered, it becomes clouds and mist;\nGathered, it becomes form and shadow.\nIssuing forth, it transforms into immortals;\nEntering in, it becomes the True One.\nAbove, it binds the Three Primordials;\nBelow, it binds the myriad things.\n\nThe two qi part and unite,\nGoverning things in their seasons.\nThe Three Ways wax and wane,\nEmergence and retreat follow fate—\nThe Nine Mysteries’ Dao Lords of Later Sages arrange the records.\n\nThe sun is the essence of yang, the eldest of virtue.\nVirtue is that to which the myriad things return.\nThe sun rises in the east, and the myriad things also emerge in the east;\nThe sun flourishes in the south,\nSets in the west,\nHides in the north—\nAll things follow it.\nThe sun’s home is in the south, its position at noon.\nIn the fifth month, yin qi stirs within—\nA minor waning.\n\nThe sun’s breadth spans two thousand thirty *li*,\nGolden divisions,\nWater essence’s halo within,\nFlowing light shining without.\n\nWithin it lie walled cities and people, seven-jeweled bathing pools, where blue, yellow, and white lotuses bloom. The people stand twenty-four feet tall, clad in crimson robes, their flowering synchronized in decline and flourishing. Five winds govern the sun’s movement, thus ordering the sun, moon, and constellations in their celestial courses—all perfected by Brahmā.\n\nIts framework: above the Golden Gate, the sun’s passage is the Open Portal. Within the Golden Gate lies the Pool of Refined Golden Essence, situated at the western pass, to the left of the division. Thus, on the day of *Lìchūn*, the solar spirit is further refined within the Golden Gate, its radiance shining beyond for forty-five days before ceasing. It proceeds in sequence to the Cavern-Yang Palace, the sun’s upper abode. On the day of *Lìxià*, it halts at the Cavern-Yang Palace, exhaling the essence of molten gold to irrigate the Eastern Well, bathing in the luminous splendor. Gathering the Eight Pure qi, it returns to the Palace of Vast Cold, arriving in thirty-five days—the moon’s upper abode beneath the Seven Stars’ floral canopy.\n\nOn the day of *Lìdōng*, the solar essence lies concealed within the Palace of Vast Cold. The sun’s yearly circuit completes its measure, crowned and girded in the four directions. The Two Luminaries part and unite; yin and yang wax and wane.\n\nThe sun and moon are the celestial and terrestrial ministers of emptiness.\n\nFrom *Laozi’s Esoteric Canon of the Calendar*:\nThe sun’s surname is Zhāng, personal name Biǎo, courtesy name Chángshǐ.\n\nFrom *The Three Sovereigns*:\nThe Sun-Moon King’s palaces and walled cities.\n\nThe eastern, western, southern, and northern spans measure two thousand and forty *li*. The walled city has seven concentric layers, each adorned with bamboo, trees, and groves. The city’s four gates enclose pools and forests where phoenixes, vermilion birds, and flying crows dwell—this is the chaotic wind’s domain and the Sun King’s abode.\n\nAt the city’s center stands a palace of yellow gold. On all four sides of the city walls rise golden towers and pavilions, their heights and depths spanning forty *li*. On the fiftieth heaven, beings descend to become the Sun Heavenly King, radiating great luminosity that illuminates the golden towers on all sides, generating five hundred beams of light to shine upon the four directions. The celestial beings of these heavens live for nine million years.\n\nThe Perfected of the Nine Heavens call the sun *Zhuóyào Luó*; the Perfected of the Three Heavens call it *Yuánguāng Wèi*; in the Heaven of Grand Simplicity, it is named *Miàojǐng*; the Supreme Perfected call it *Jiǔyào Shēng*. The Supreme Perfected constantly rides the luminous jade wheel, feasting within the sun. The immortals of Great Clarity call the sun *Dàmíng*; the Perfected of the Great Ultimate call it *Míngyuán*.\n\nIn the primordial era, within the Heaven of Purple Prime, there was ever a radiant glow, thin as mist—this was the origin of the nine suns, their light akin to that of a single moon. In the Heaven of Jade Worthies, the sun is called *Wēixuán*.\n\nThe radiance of the sun and moon is the effulgent bloom of their numinous brilliance. The Crimson Qi King is the divine spirit above the sun, named *Jiāngchē Liángzhī*. Those who know the name of the Crimson Qi King will not die but ascend to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Lord Lao calls the sun *Tàibǎo*; the Nine Radiance Eastern Perfected call it *Zǐyào Míng*, or sometimes *Yuánmèi*.\n\nThe sun’s essence is crimson, square in form yet round in radiance. Each month, it passes five times above the Golden Gate, where the essence of gold, stone radiance, and the water-mother’s flower are refined within the sun’s soul, casting forth eight rays of luminous essence.\n\nThe Cinnabar Crucible’s cinnabar qi nurtures celestial essence, firm yet receptive to the yielding. The yin bloom of scorching water, the sun’s primal radiance, is called *Dàmíng*. Nine yang forces coalesce, and twin vapors arise together. Concentrating the spirit and harmonizing the soul, the essence of harmonious qi gives birth to the Five Emperors within. They ride the light to govern form, their heads crowned with dragon-flower kerchiefs, clad in crimson sashes and azure robes. Simurghs and crows flow in mystery, their rosy glow suffusing the azure above.\n\nThe Azure Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Yuáncháng Yuán* and courtesy name *Zhàolóng Tāo*, wears a robe of azure-jade brocade and a cape of verdant, feathered splendor.\n\nThe Vermilion Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Dānlíng Zhì* and courtesy name *Lǜhóng Yìng*, wears a robe of crimson-jade brocade and a cape of vermilion, feathered splendor.\n\nThe White Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Hàoyù Jiāng* and courtesy name *Huíjīn Xiá*, wears a robe of white-jade brocade and a cape of white, feathered splendor.\n\nThe Black Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Chéngcáo Tíng* and courtesy name *Xuánlǜ Yán*, wears a robe of black-jade brocade and a cape of black, feathered splendor.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Shòuyì Fù* and courtesy name *Piāohuī Xiàng*, wears a robe of yellow-jade brocade and a cape of yellow, feathered splendor.\n\nThe sun’s inner spirit, the Lady of the Solar Soul, is named *Àixiāo Tái* and governs the Nine Perfected within.\n\nThe moon’s domain lies in the north, corresponding to the *zǐ* position; thus, in the eleventh month, the myriad things germinate beneath the earth. The moon’s breadth spans two thousand nine hundred *li*, while its radiant circumference measures seven thousand eight hundred and forty *li*. Within, white silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal reflect one another, divided into sixty parts, their scorching brilliance illuminating the interior. The city walls and populace are arrayed with seven-jeweled bathing pools and forests of eight *qiān* trees growing within.\n\nThe people of the moon stand sixteen feet tall, clad in garments of azure hue. From the first to the sixteenth day of the month, they gather white silver and lapis lazuli, refining them in the crucible of scorching light—thus, as the moon waxes, its luminosity grows bright and vast. From the seventeenth to the twenty-ninth day, beneath the *qiān* forests, they gather the blossoms of the three qi to brush the light of the sun and moon.\n\nOn the autumnal equinox, the moon lodges above the Eastern Well in the Hall of Vast Spirit, bathing in the Eastern Well’s pool to refine the lunar soul, brightening the eightfold radiance of clarity. It receives the yang essence from the sun’s brilliance and exhales yellow qi into the Jade Pool. All celestial beings gather the blossoms of the jade trees to brush the light of the sun and moon, while the moon’s yellow qi washes the countenances of the heavenly beings. The autumnal equinox is the day of the celestial assembly.\n\nOn the winter solstice, the moon rests in the upper lodge of Vast Cold, nurturing the lunar soul in the Vast Cold’s pool. It absorbs yellow qi into the jade womb and exhales yang essence into the frigid pool. All celestial beings gather the blossoms of the azure forests to brush the light of the sun and moon, while the moon’s yang essence washes the countenances of the heavenly beings.\n\nOn the vernal equinox, the moon lodges above the Golden Gate—this is the moon’s gate of numinous communion. Within the crucible of golden essence, it refines the pool of stone radiance and water-mother, adorning its luminous splendor. It irrigates the Golden Gate with yang essence and absorbs yellow qi into the Jade Spring. All celestial beings gather the blossoms of the *qiān* trees to brush the light of the sun and moon, while the sun’s yellow qi washes the countenances of the heavenly beings.\n\nOn the summer solstice, the moon rests in the Cavern-Yang Palace, the upper lodge of the day and the moon’s flowing fire court. It refines the eight rays, brightening the solar soul, irrigating the Cavern-Yang with yellow qi, and absorbing yang essence into the Fire Palace. The Eight Pure Perfected all gather the forests of azure emptiness to brush the light of the sun and moon, while the moon’s yang essence washes the countenances of the heavenly beings.\n\nThe moon’s surname is *Wén*, personal name *Shēn*, courtesy name *Zǐguāng*. From *The Three Sovereigns*: The Moon Heavenly King’s abode is a palace of lapis lazuli. On all four sides of the city walls rise golden towers and pavilions, six hundred and forty *li* in height. Beings from the fifteenth heaven descend to become the Moon Heavenly King, radiating great luminosity to illuminate the world without cease.\n\nThe *Eight Qiān*—trees of the moon, also called the King of Medicines—comprise eight trees in total.\n\nThe moon’s radiance is yellow, square in essence yet round in form, revolving and waxing, its circuit complete yet ever waning.\n\nOn the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each lunar cycle, the moon bathes in the numinous radiance above the Eastern Well, adorning its essence and refining its luminous brilliance, so that its golden splendor shines anew.

At the hour of settled meditation, when generative qi first stirs, the Seven Stars undergo refinement in the Palace of Broad Coldness, their luminous purple effulgence mingling with the radiance of the Seven Luminaries. At this moment, the Seven Luminaries blaze and scatter, their essence streaming across the heavens, their purple effulgence spilling forth to irrigate all heavens. Thereupon, the Perfected gather the purple-orchid effulgence and the light of the Seven Luminaries, which transform into seven youths: the first named Pivot Bright, the second Radiant Spirit, the third Northern Origin, the fourth Treasure Essence, the fifth Cinnabar Infant, the sixth Numinous Purity, and the seventh Purple Jade—these are the inner essences of the Seven Treasures, metamorphosed into the Perfected of the Seven Luminaries.\n\n**Supreme Perfected Unity Lord**\nIn his left hand, he grasps the handle of the Northern Dipper; in his right, the firmness of the Northern Aster.

Alternating by day within the mysteries of the Dark Realm, they abide in the limpid waves of the Celestial River.\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Chapter of Spirit Generation*—the Crimson Youth crosses the Bitter River.

The Primordial Beginning sings within the azure jade void above the Great Floating Li Land, seated upon the azure clouds.\n\n**The Lord Emperor of the Great Tenuity**\nBorn within luminous clouds, enwrapped in five-colored clouds, he is also named Jade Emptiness. His true essence solidifies and his fluid consolidates; myriad thoughts revolve through the Dark Clouds, and his contemplation soars through the empyrean to ascend the void.

When Heaven and Earth achieve harmony, sweet dew descends. Drawing from the dark canal’s sweet dew transforms white hair and restores square pupils.\n\n**The Great Cavern**\nWhen yang qi reaches its transformation, snow turns to rain; when yin qi reaches its transformation, rain turns to snow.\n\n**The Crown Prince**\nIn the northwest stands the Sky-Sustaining Fire—Pillar; wind descending from above brings cold.

Stirring the hundred yangs gives birth to lightning; drumming the thousand yins releases its might.\n\n**The Great Sage Sovereign**\n*Fourth of the Earthly Grades*\n\nThose of earthly talent accumulate yin and congeal dregs, bearing mountains upon their backs. The Most High dons the garb of office.\n\n*The Sutra of Karmic Retribution*\n\nHeaven and Earth: south at *wu*, north at *zi*; east at *mao*, west at *you*. The four void corners lie each ninety million myriad *li* apart. The Earth is ten thousand *li* thick, and beneath it lies the great void’s four corners, where natural golden pillars stand.

When a ruler achieves great virtue, if grievances and cruelties arise, Heaven and Earth quake in response, and spirits are moved by it.\n\nThe Earth is all of glassy lapis, white silver, purple gold, true pearls, and azure jade, interspersed and combined to form palaces of golden millet and the seven treasures.\n\n**Mount Jade Capital**\n*Questions Posed by the Immortal Duke*\n\nThe spirit of *Qian*.\n\nThe name is Zhongni, the title is Fuxi. *Scripture Within the Canon*\n\nThe spirit of *Kun*: personal name, Grand Master Zeng.\nThe spirit of *Gen*: personal name, Not the Former Kings.\nThe spirit of *Zhen*: personal name, Lesser Master Zeng.\nThe spirit of *Xun*: personal name, Grand Xiahou.\nThe spirit of *Li*: personal name, Kong Wenchang.\nThe spirit of *Kan*: personal name, Yang Xiongzhao, royal title, Nüwa.\nThe spirit of *Dui*: personal name, First Generation.\n\n**Great Blessing Hall Realm**\nMolten gold irrigates the land; the four-sided stairways are of azure jade and lapis.

The Perfected of the Numinous Treasure bestowed upon him three hundred Jade Maidens of Great Florescence and three hundred Jade Lads of the Official Ranks, all adorned with every excellence.\n\n*The Thirty-Two Marks*\nHis name was inscribed among the heavens. As a tenfold-turned disciple, he bestowed mountains upon the reclusive Daoists. Seven generations of his ancestors befriended the Five Thearchs. His merits were vast, his recompense profound. His boundless generosity flowed across the four seas, honoring masters and revering the Dao. Having recited the scriptures ten thousand times, the Supreme Lord’s dragon-drawn chariot descended to welcome him, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nTo yield is to defer—such is the Dao’s recompense. To yield virtue is to defer power. Among people, none are noble or base; those who hold the Dao are revered.\n\nBreathing in harmonious equilibrium, observing precepts and scriptures—there are many paths to the Way, and small efforts may yet achieve greatness.\n\nLet the heart be supple as reeds, that calamities may cease and blessings arise. With a heart of compassion toward the myriad things, one’s kindness pervades all beings.\n\nThe highest goodness is filial piety supreme. To yearn for undying guardianship and transform one’s parents—such was the most filial son of the Supreme Thearch of High Antiquity, whose virtue resounded across the four quarters.\n\n*The Great Peace*\nHis name entered the realm of the Perfected.\n\n*The Dispelling of Demons*\n\nProclaiming the Dao’s qi, converting the deluded and lost.\nStirring harmonious melodies, the flying cry echoes at the ford.\n\nThe Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuity\ndwells in silent chambers, gazing upon the cold, dark stream.\nHe plumbs the two images, exhaling and inhaling the soaring rosy clouds.\nContemplating the five luminances to illumine himself,\nhe moves the radiant glow of rosy hues—rich and lush—\nflowing and gleaming through the jade hall and purple chambers.\n\nReturning to truth, reverting to simplicity,\nroaming the Great Plain,\nobserving the lingering customs of the Three Dynasties,\ninwardly cherishing gold and jade.\n\nThe wanderer\nnow in mountains, now in waters,\nnow in the world, now at home,\nnow in court, now in the wilds.\n\n*The Jade Writ of the Grand Empyrean*\nRacing in the three karmas, bewildered by the six passions—\nthe Supreme Purity of the Perfected.\nDeceiving heaven, deluding earth—\nthe wondrous truth.\n\nBearing mountains, shouldering stones,\ndragging through the eight adversities,\nstealing the lives of others in life,\nfacing calamitous retribution in death.\n\n*The Ordinances of Illuminating Truth*\nInverting yin and yang, violating sun and moon.\n\n*The Bright Years*\nReviling heaven and earth, humiliating the clouds and empyrean,\ncursing the winds of the south.\n\n*The Manifest Might*\nDemonic paths diverge,\nconfounding the heart—\ndeath leads to the three wretched destinies.\nEntering the crimson-linked hells,\namidst water and fire,\nfor two thousand *yi* kalpas,\nbereft of human form.\n\nRushing toward peril in water and fire,\ndisdaining past lives as delusion,\nmocking the sacred scriptures as false and absurd.\nThe mysterious teachings decline,\nheaven and humanity drown in suffering.\n\nDisbelieving the great Dharma,\ndisrespecting the luminous deities,\ndefiling and scorning the numinous texts—\nin death, ascending the sword trees,\nwhere winds from eight directions blow,\nswaying the trees low and high.\nFeet descend upon the knife mountains,\nborn with the six afflictions,\nrevolving through the five torments,\nsinking into the fields of sin.\n\nBestow upon me the medicine of grace\nto cure the illness of ignorance,\nwith words of goodness expounded,\ndispelling the darkness of delusion,\nthat the eye of wisdom may grow clear,\ncool and bright,\nilluminating the true form.\n\n*The Root and Boundary*\nThe six passions, once stained...\n\nThrough the three wretched realms they revolve,\nadrift and forgetful of return;\nthrough the five paths of existence they drift,\nlong sunk in delusion, never awakening.\n\n*The Settled Will*\n\nA thousand pounds of gold,\na single scripture of immortality—\nbestowed upon a barren mountain,\nthe next life shall surely yield a fortune of gold.\nGreed is the great sickness,\nnot to be cured by moxa or mugwort.\nTwenty-five years\nof unspent blessings:\nthe Registrar of Destiny submits the record,\ngranting seven hundred years of great lifespan.\n\n*The Precepts of the True Root*\n\nHuman passions are hard to restrain,\nlike a banner raised in the wind,\nfluttering without cease—\nonly the sage can still them.\nThe immortal lads attending the scriptures\nreport the arrogant to the Three Heavens;\nthe Registrar of the True submits to the Most High.\nThree memorials filed, and you shall lose the Way.\n\n*The Questions of the Immortal Duke*\n\nTo judge and slander the Dao and its virtue,\nto revile and shame the celestial true:\nmouth says one thing, heart another—\nthe wellspring of a hundred evils.\nKarmic stench pervades the heart,\nshattering the ten virtues,\nfostering the ten evils.\nThe four thoroughfares lie desolate,\nthe six penetrations are blocked.\nThe five spirits run wild,\nfondness for wine corrupts conduct.\nThe three fears, the three calamities—\nin death, one descends to the Dark Capital,\nexamined and bound in the ghostly prison,\nrevolving through kalpas uncounted.\n\n*The Teachings of the *Laozi***\n\nThe five desires—\ninnumerable thoughts, innumerable beings:\nthe eye desires to see the five colors,\nexcess wearies the hun-soul;\nthe ear desires to hear the five sounds,\nclamor torments the hun-soul;\nthe nose desires to smell the five fragrances,\nfragrance overflows and essence flows away;\nthe mouth desires the five sweet flavors,\nabundance muddies the spirit;\nthe body desires to indulge in the five pleasures,\nsloth scatters the will, harms the spleen, and endangers conduct.\nThe five evils.\n\n**The *Scripture of Numinous Writ for Deliverance of Destiny***\n\n**The Seven Harms**\nThe August Sage Emperor said:\nThe first harm—\nthe spirit weeps in the Exhausted Mansion, its cries ascending on high.\nThe second harm—\none’s dark name is erased from the registers, extinguished in the Nine Springs.\nThe third harm—\nthe Five Mansion’s works collapse, the myriad spirits shudder in alarm.\nTrue immortals soar in lofty flight,\nthe Red Child wails in sorrow.\nThough a dark record exists,\nthe Jade Name is lost in vain.\nThe fourth harm—\nthe hun-soul departs, the po-soul flees,\nthe nine apertures fill with dust,\nthe Five Mansion falls to ruin.\nThe fifth harm—\nthe Azure Bureau inscribes one’s name,\nthe Golden Watchtower binds it in its annals.\nOne scorns the true and cheapens the precious,\nreversing the Black Seven Mysteries.\nThe sixth harm—\nthe Five Spirits scatter and fly,\nthe numinous essence loses its radiance.\nThe seventh harm—\ntrue qi grieves at the Gate of the Numinous,\nthe wandering spirit startles the Red Child.\nHun and po wander through the palatial abodes,\nwhile true immortals ascend in lofty flight to Jade Clarity.\n\n**The *Nine Heavens of Turning Heaven***\n\n**The Ten Calamities**\nOne cultivates the practice,\nyet fails to uphold the Dao with constancy.\nThe calamity of serving a master—\none does not remain devoted to the end of one’s days.\nThe Perfected One said:\nOf ten failures, one failure—\nthe hun-soul wails in the Numinous Mansion,\nits cries ascending to the Heavenly Pavilion,\nwhere the Three Bureaus contend in judgment.\n\n**Springtime Hunting**\nSpreading nets and casting snares,\nsetting fires to burn the mountains—\nin death, one bears the iron staff,\nten thousand pains converging,\ndriven to exhaustion through a hundred extremes.\n\n**The *Clarification of the True***\n\nDamming rivers and breaching channels,\nspreading nets and dangling lines—\nin death, one enters the Mountain of Knives and Forest of Swords,\nthough wisdom and right contemplation endure.\nLife’s span cannot be fully explored,\nnor can one harmonize with the heart of Heaven and Earth,\nor the intent of yin and yang.\nThus, longevity remains elusive.\n\nLife and destiny—\nthe most precious treasures of Heaven’s Dao.\nOnly by possessing virtue in secret\ndo the Six Directions of Heaven and Earth,\nthe Eight Distances, and the myriad things\nall attain their proper place,\nand thus gain an increase in years,\nfulfilling one’s allotted heavenly span.\nThis is longevity.\n\nWithin the hollow void, beyond the boundless expanse,\nabove the utmost heights, below the lowest depths—\nthus does one cultivate the Dao through stillness and silence to nurture the body,\nthrough clarity and coolness to pacify the heart,\nthrough sincerity and integrity to uphold one’s resolve.\n\nDwelling in profound seclusion, abiding in tranquility,\nlike the hidden coil of the dragon in the deep;\nmired yet unsoiled,\nlike the two luminaries absent from the void;\ntransforming virtue to preserve the spirit,\nlike the sacred altars safeguarding their radiance;\nestablishing reverence for the divine,\nlike the ancestral temple maintaining its sanctity.\n\nUnseen by others,\nlike the sacred fish within the vast net;\nunknown to all,\nlike the sun’s rising beyond the east;\nmy boundlessness,\nlike the Dao’s limitless expanse.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are divine,\nthey cannot restrain it;\nthough the sun and moon are bright,\nthey cannot halt it.\n\n**The *Great Peace***\nThe brain palace filled,\nharmonizing the Six Fluids.\n\n**The *Three Primordial Caverns’ Pearl of the Dao***\nThe palace of life’s court—\nthe Perfected dwells within the formless,\nrests in the neighborless,\nand attains the living source of the Mystic Pearl.\n\n**The *Tortoise Mountain Record of Origins***\nLongevity equal to the sun and moon.\n\nHe who gains the Heavenly Lord’s trust and heart—\na long-lived one, who serves with the celestial gods above.\nNo reckoning of fate or

Clouds.\nShouldering my satchel, I approached the Heavenly Gate,\ninquiring of the Supreme Lord’s abode.\nSuddenly I met the Purple Tenuity Garden,\nwhere Perfected Ones stood thick as hemp.\nGreen

water-jade,\nSo-called: exhaling and inhaling the Grand Harmony of spontaneity,\nRiding the numinous qi of the Nine Essences.\nIngesting qi for ten thousand years,\nEver possessing youthful countenance.\n\nFrom the *Five Talismans*:\nThe Primordial Five Qi.\n\nTo ascend the numinous treasure of Jade Mountain in the Mystic Capital’s Upper Palace, where the first radiance of yang light scatters the Primordial Beginning’s brilliance, streaming to irrigate all heavens—its qi dense and luxuriant, its glow warm and fragrant, essence like moon-pearls, light like purple mountains—this descends to nourish the roots of the scholar’s five teeth. The Perfected of Great Wisdom in the Upper Palace feed upon this radiance, completing their union with heaven.\n\nFrom the *Jade Sleeve of Numinous Treasure*:\n**Method of Ingesting the Teeth’s Qi**\nAt the eight solar nodes, enter the chamber in purity and alignment, visualizing the forms of the Five Elders. Practicing this for eight years, immortal officials and jade maidens will attend you; your body will emanate luminosity, illuminating the ten directions. The Five Thearchs will bow in reverence, and the administrators of the Three Realms will welcome you.\n\n**Five Immortals**\nJade mushrooms in the Mystic Gulf’s depths.\n\nFrom the *Twenty-Four Images of Vital Generation*:\nConstantly contemplate the great sun within the spleen, and within the sun a golden tower, where a book lies sealed with a golden seal, three characters in breadth and length. When the sun’s majesty reveals it, read it aloud—your heart will open, your eyes will brighten, and you will become a transcendent.\n\nFrom the *Laozi’s Observation of Heaven*:\nFocus on the Yellow Field within the stomach—pure white as congealed fat, suffused with yellow qi. When it reaches the mouth, swallow it to attain satiety. This Yellow Field is the Great Granary. All spirits gather there to feast, where a yellow lightning cauldron steams rice, and jade maidens and youths serve as attendants, announcing: “The Yellow Thearch’s child has prepared the traveling kitchen.”\n\n**Guiding Qi Nine Ascents and Nine Descents**\nAfter twelve days, the body lightens; after eighteen days, minor attainment is reached; after thirty-six days, the Dao is greatly accomplished; after eighty days, the head and face radiate light; after one hundred twenty days, one becomes a Perfected.\n\n**Entering the Chamber to Burn Incense**\nFace due south, close the breath, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Visualize as prescribed: *Li* above the head, *Kan* below the navel, *Kun* in the left hand, *Xun* in the right hand, *Qian* beneath the left foot, *Gen* beneath the right foot, *Dui* below the left flank, *Zhen* below the right flank. The eight trigrams manifest their forms, forms contain qi, qi contains spirit. The spirit-person shines with luminosity, arrayed in the eight directions, exhaling generative qi. In spring, *Zhen* governs and engenders fire; in summer, *Li* governs and engenders earth; in autumn, *Dui* governs and engenders water; in winter, *Kan* governs and engenders wood. During the four seasons, *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, and *Xun* govern metal, rotating with the months: *Xun* in the third month, *Kun* in the sixth, *Qian* in the ninth, *Gen* in the twelfth.\n\n**Method of Swallowing the Eight Qi**\nIn the months of *yin* and *mao* (spring), inhale *Zhen* qi three times, then spray high qi nine times; next sip *Xun* qi four times, then *Kun* qi twice; next spray *Qian* qi six times, then sip *Gen* qi eight times, *Dui* qi seven times, and *Kan* qi once. Conclude by knocking the teeth thirty-six times, rubbing the four limbs and five body parts. Practice this during the three or six periods of purification, bowing to the Supreme Eight Simplicities.\n\n**Morning and Evening**\nRecite: *jiazi*, *yichou*, *bingyin*, *dingmao*, *wuchen*, halting at *chen*. Strike the golden beam with jade clappers, circulate the Flowery Pond to recite the Wine Spring, scoop dew from the Boat-Shaving Pool, rinse the mouth’s perimeter, then swallow once after three repetitions—three swallows in total. Perform the *Six Jia* of the Lower Cinnabar as before, totaling thirty swallows to ingest their essential brilliance. The so-called golden beam is the tongue; the jade clappers are the teeth; the Wine Spring, Cinnabar Pond, and Dew Scoop are the saliva in the mouth.\n\nFrom the *Method of Ingesting Qi*:\nAt dawn, consume the qi of the five clouds; at dusk, chant the three dawn-lights.\n\n**The Cavernous Numinous Chapters**\nThe Great Dao wondrously formless,\nIts numinous transformations manifest the Three Spirits.\nAt dawn, draw in the essence of the Five Stars;\nAt midday, spray the nectar of the sun’s core;\nAt dusk, ingest the yellow radiance of the moon;\nIn sleep, refine the Five Immortals beyond the body.\n\n**The Twenty-Four Images of Vital Generation**\n*Ingesting the Sun’s Essence*\nTo ensure longevity, the child must consume the sun’s essence.\nOn the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and fifteenth days of the lunar month, from sunrise to midday, ingest it thus:\nFirst visualize the sun at the center of the heart, the sun crowned with a dark canopy, beneath which stands a small boy, perfectly crimson, his crimson qi suffusing nine layers within and without the body. Envision the qi filling the head, ascending from the head to rise into the heavens, circling the sun ninefold.\n\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Sun Sovereign, Primordial Yang,\nReturn to the Crimson Chamber.\nUnite with my virtue,\nTogether nourishing the small boy.\"*\n\nThen visualize the surging essence descending into the nose, swallowing it twenty-seven times. The heart becomes filled with three figures: to the left, the Great One, the Father; to the right, the Dark Radiance, the Mother; at the center, the Crimson Child, the small boy. Seated upon a golden bed and jade couch, they hold jade ladles and jade cups. Within the cup appear jade blossoms, divine wine, and celestial ganoderma—visualize consuming them to attain longevity.\n\n*Ingesting the Moon’s Essence*\nThis too grants longevity.\nOn the fifteenth night of the lunar month at midnight, face the moon and bow twice. Recite the incantation:\n*\"Moon Sovereign, Radiant Child,\nReturn to the Cinnabar Field.\nUnite with my virtue,\nTogether nourishing the small boy.\"*\n\nVisualize the moon’s white, pure, yellow essence descending into the nose and mouth, swallowing it twenty-one times. The moon’s essence anchors to the root of the kidneys, ensuring longevity.\n\n*Ingesting the Stars’ Essence*\nThis ascends to the Grand Clarity.\nAt sunrise, dusk, midday, or midnight, visualize the Great Yellow Star of the North Pole. Recite the incantation:\n*\"August Heaven, Eternal Supreme Dao Lord,\nYour humble descendant petitions for longevity.\"*\n\nEnvision the star’s essence descending, lingering between the brows, flowing into the nose and mouth. Swallow it fifteen times until the qi fills the heart and gallbladder. Within the spleen, the Dao Mother cradles the Crimson Child—thus is longevity attained.\n\nThe flying boat is named *Frost*,\nSimmering and refining the clouds and waters.\n\nJasper and vermilion gold gleam bright,\nNine crucibles blaze in the heavens’ height.\nAscend the body to the Nine Heavens,\nLeap beyond the Mystic Isles to roam the Nine Palaces’ domains—\nYet the True Person’s gate remains

Zixuan, was a native of Qushui in Puyang. He studied under the immortal Master Qiu of Mount Hua for five years, gaining the ability to enter and exit water and fire, his complexion like that of a maiden. The Master declared: \"You are a true person.\"\n\n*True Unity of the Three Primes*\n\nThe Lady of South Marchmount, surnamed Wei, styled Xian’an, was a native of Rencheng. On a midnight of clarity in the final month of winter, she heard amidst the profound darkness the resounding of bells and drums, the melodies of reed pipes and flutes—eight tones clamoring in harmony. Gazing outward into the empty void, she saw descending from the eastern heavens: the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, Anduming; the Great Divinity of Eastern Florescence, the Azure Lad of Fangzhu; and the Perfected One of Jade Radiance of the Bihé Yang Valley of Fusang, the Perfected of Pure Emptiness, the Lesser You Immortal King Wang Zideng. The Lady prostrated herself in reverence and was bestowed two elixirs: the first, *Hidden Transcendence and Self-Concealing Spirit Powder*; the second, *Stone Essence and Golden Light Transfiguration Spirit Pellets*. After seven days of ingestion, past midnight, the Supreme Celestial Immortals dispatched a soaring chariot to receive her. The Lady employed the *Mirror Method* to entrust her form to a sword and pillow, and from that moment, she vanished.\n\n*Inner Transmission of the Purple Void Primordial Lady*\n*Celestial Immortal Medicines*\n\nShould the Great Granary’s hoarded grain be piled high—\n*Crimson Silken Vermilion Child* is cinnabar.\nFrom the *Numinous Writ of Purple Text*:\n\n*Sun-Soul of Cinnabar Mountain* is realgar;\n*Moon-Essence of the Dark Terrace* is orpiment;\n*White Silk Flying Dragon* is white quartz;\n*Green-Waisted Maiden Within* is malachite;\n*Purple Mound Literary Marquis* is amethyst;\n*Flying Blossom of Jasper Wall* is graphite;\n*Mysterious Pearl of the Northern Thearch* is nitre;\n*Yellow Lad of the Nine Numinous* is sulfur;\n*Golden Ram of the Five Essences* is actinolite;\n*Flying Blossom of Rain-Florescence* is mica;\n*White Tiger’s Shed Fangs* is gold-tooth stone;\n*Flowing Cinnabar White Cream* is ceruse;\n*Reversed-Marching Divine Bone* is halite.\n\nThose who ascend in learning ingest the Dao of sun and moon, meditate upon the Lesser Yang Perfected of Cinnabar Numinosity, and fill a lapis lazuli vessel with *Jade Spring Azure Fungus Cream* to anoint their destined form. They further take a golden crucible to refine and congeal the cream, bathing their bodies in the yellow qi of yang essence. *Mysterious Water Jade Liquid*—also called *Flying Dragon Cloud Marrow* or *Refined Quintuple-Stone Flower Cream*—when consumed for fifteen years, bestows a jade radiance upon the body, longevity coeval with heaven and earth, and command over ghosts and spirits. After three years, one’s hair may write by night. This formula surpasses the ingestion of eight-fold refined minerals, excelling even the *Jade Nectar of Cassia Water and Mica*.\n\nFrom the *Great Cavern*:\n*Mysterious Ripple of Dark Herbage* is the marrow of black sesame, also called *Mysterious Clarity*.\nFrom the *Feminine Unity and Five Elders*:\n*Purple Forest Marrow*.\nFrom the *Lord Mao*:\n*Fill-Soul and Secure-Spirit*.\n\nThe *Seventy-Four Directions Flying Spirit Pellets*—when consumed, one may ride the void and walk the emptiness.\n\nFrom the *Purple Radiance of Scorching Flame*:\nThe *Grand Unity’s Fourfold Guardian Pellets* confer longevity of ten thousand years.\n\nFrom the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*:\nLady Wei’s ears and eyes grew clear and bright at eighty-three. In the moon’s light, she inscribed Daoist talismans for disciples. Through meditative absorption, she entered her chamber, fasting for a hundred days or even decades.\n\nFrom the *Inner Transmission of the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign*:\nEarthbound Perfected Ones first expel the Three Corpse-Worms, which bear three names and sever three lives. If the Three Ghosts remain, they pierce the Six Palaces and agitate the Five Spirits.\n\nFrom the *Unified Method of the Primordial True One*:\nThe *Supreme Eight Jade Flying Essence Elixir*—the Perfected One Mao Ying, styled Shu and Shen, hailed from Nanguan in Xianyang. His master was the North-Facing Northern River Ghost Valley Master, who dwelt in reclusion on Mount Hua. At eighteen, Ying fled his home for Mount Heng. His great-grandfather, Mao Meng, had once ascended to heaven in broad daylight upon clouds and dragons amid Mount Hua. The village’s ballad sang:\n*\"The divine immortal attained by Mao at first perfection,\nRode the dragon upward to enter the Grand Clarity.\nNow he sports on the Dark Continent and Crimson City,\nPassing through generations to come—here in me, Ying.\"*\nThe Thearch’s master lauded him in the twelfth month.\n\nYing remained on the mountain for six years, whereupon he dreamed of the Supreme Mystery Jade Maiden presenting him with a jade writ and leading him, saying: \"The Western Citadel King Lord possesses the true Dao.\" Thereupon he bowed his head in reverence and journeyed to the Numinous Citadel to meet the King Lord. In the seventeenth year, the King Lord charged him with overseeing the divine registers of robes and scriptures. After three years of cultivation, he was commanded to ride forth to White Jade Mill Mountain, where the Queen Mothers of the Azure Palace resided. The King Lord further bestowed upon Ying a dose of the Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir and a single immortal formula. The Heavenly Thearch then appointed him as Upper Minister of the Eastern Marchmount and Director of Life and Death at Huolin, overseeing the registers of life and death in Wu and Yue. Thereupon he instructed his two younger brothers to ingest the Azure Tooth. Later, he told Ji Weiqing: \"You ought to ingest the Divine Formula of the Four Fans Powder, which the Wind Sovereign received from the Yellow Emperor—I once received it from the Most High Master, and now transmit it to you.\" He also addressed Si Heqing, saying: \"You ought to ingest the Queen Mother’s Four Lads’ Elixir Powder to replenish the marrow and fortify the brain.\" Both formulas were wondrous. After eighteen years of ingesting the medicines, his two younger brothers’ complexions became like those of maidens. *The Inner Transmission of Lord Mao*.\n\nMay the Mysterious Mother share with me the natural Seven Treasures Jade Syrup and the Golden Elixir of Purple Concealed Zhi. To the right, gather the Five Summons Night Radiance, Phoenix Brain, Tiger Foam, Cloud Lang, and Jade Frost—with but a single taste of these wondrous flavors, one brushes against the Great Void.\n\n*The Feminine One*\n\nThe Sage Lord led the Azure Youth to sit and served the flowing rosy nectar, red trees with white seeds, and crimson woods with azure fruits.\n\n*The Purple Text of Numinous Writ*\n\nThe August Person was dispatched by the Lord of Fusang, governing the immortal officials of Mount Emei. His body stood nine feet tall, his fur covering his form, and he dwelled beneath the northern cliff. Within, his house was made of azure jade, his bed of yellow jade, draped with curtains of patterned silk, and burning the incense of a thousand harmonies. His attendants were all jade maidens among the immortals, and three seated treasures were all Great Clarity Immortal Kings. They set out jujubes brimming in measures and rinsed their mouths with the numinous nectar of the Vermilion Palace’s Jade Well.\n\n*The Five Talismans*\n\nThe Dark Water Cloud Blossom Nectar, also called the Cloud-Stored Vermilion Nectar. Drinking five *ge* daily, one’s face becomes youthful and one’s body fragrant.\n\n*The Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*\n\nTo study the Dao, one must wander the palaces of the sun and moon, meet the kings of the sun and moon, and drink the essence of the sun and moon, the golden-bound nectar.\n\n*Wisdom*\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate consumed the thousand-stone Azure Essence Rice, the divine formula of the highest immortals. Eating this rice renders one immune to all harm. After ten years, the spirit of the Azure Essence coalesces to summon wind and rain, and a single dose extends one’s lifespan by a thousand years.\n\n*The Inner Transmission of Perfected Lord Wang of Pure Emptiness*\n\nThe five divine zhi of Mount Juqu:\n\nThe first is the Dragon Immortal Zhi, resembling intertwined dragons with leaves as scales and roots like coiled dragons. Those who consume it are appointed as Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate.\n\nThe second is the Ginseng Zhi, crimson in color with a radiant vermilion glow, its branches and leaves chiming like metal and stone when struck. Those who consume it are appointed as Grand Masters of the Great Ultimate.\n\nThe third is the Swallow Embryo Zhi, purple in hue, shaped like a sunflower with leaves bearing the likeness of flying swallows, its luminosity penetrating and clear. Eating one stalk appoints one as the Dragon-Tiger Immortal Lord of Great Clarity and Rectifying Unity Gentleman of the Court.\n\nThe fourth is the Night Cavern Zhi, green in color with white fruits like plums, standing three to four feet tall, its leaves resembling cypress. At night, its fruits illuminate an entire chamber like moonlight. Each stalk bears nine fruits, which fall to the ground like seven-inch mirror trays of fox, landing one to two inches thick. At night, they appear as large as oxen, and by day, they move. Eating one branch appoints one as Left Imperial Censor of the Immortal Officials of Great Clarity.\n\nThe fifth is the White Righteous Jade Zhi. Splitting open and consuming its core appoints one as Direct Perfected Censor of the Three Offices. Those who consume this zhi are commanded by the Most High to have the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate dispatch the Five Thearchs to bow in audience and appoint them.\n\nDuring its four seasons, the Swallow Embryo Zhi glows with flowing radiance, its light soaring in paired flight, illuminating the grasses at night. The zhi consumed by Lord Mao was planted by the Perfected Lord of the Great Ultimate of Fangzhu in Qingzhou, not of this kind.\n\n*The Inner Transmission of Lord Mao*\n\nThe four varieties of Great Ultimate Concealed Zhi:\n\nSome are four-sided in color, their light illuminating a hundred paces.\n\nOne kind is azure, resembling a moon mirror, three layers stacked together, five to six inches tall, called the Great Ultimate Numinous Mirror Concealing Heaven Azure Zhi.\n\nAnother is white, like the Dipper star, with seven nodes marked by stars and stems as its framework, three to four feet tall, called the Great Ultimate Concealing Chen Numinous Soul Zhi.\n\nAnother is crimson, like a small jujube tree with fruits like *lu*, its brilliance shining brightly, three to four feet tall, called the Mirror Framework Concealing Mystery Great Ultimate Golden Heaven Zhi.\n\nAnother is gray-green, like an overturned canopy on the ground, layered and circular, seven to eight inches in diameter, its clear light flowing like a candle, three to four inches tall, called the Great Ultimate Mysterious Moon Reclining Dragon Zhi.\n\n*The Golden Tablet of the Great Tenuity in Jade Script*\n\nDig six feet into the earth.\n\nPlant one mirror fruit and irrigate it with five *ge* of yellow water; in three years it sprouts grass, bearing peach-like seeds. The Five-Colored Phoenix-Brain Zhi, when its fruit is consumed, ascends to the Great Ultimate, and upon spitting upon the earth transforms into a phoenix, which one may mount to soar—also called the Great Ultimate Concealing Zhi.\n\n*The Purple Text of the Numinous Writ*\nWhen Yin Xi accompanied the Old Master on their travels, they ascended the Hall of Square Zhang on Mount Changyang and beheld the Nine Elderly Men chewing the Nine-Intertwined Zhi. Journeying south, they ascended Mount Suqiu and partook of the Nine-Radiance Zhi.\n\n*The Perfected of the Primordial Above*\nIn the Land of the Heavenly Mirror, on Phoenix Mountain, grows the Gold-Jade Purple Zhi. The various heavens scatter fragrant blossoms, while the sun and moon irrigate it with numinous radiance; when ingested, the five spirits open, and jade maidens proffer golden trays.\n\n*The Twenty-Four Images of Life*\nThe Five Zhi: their fragrance pervades the immortal peaks, where numinous branches flourish in the numinous grottoes. Once in ten thousand kalpas they blaze forth, and the various heavens intermingle in wondrous union. Tranquil awakening lingers like a single tree, as grains of sand endure for a single morning.\n\nThe Lady Wang, Middle Attendant of Eastern Florescence, wrote in her poem:\n*\"The Jade Pool irrigates the fields of quartz.\"*\n\n*The Perfect Writ of the Great Cavern*\nThe Jade-Fat Zhi grows on the Mountain of Jade, where jade cream flows forth and congeals over ten thousand years into a fat-like substance, resembling the forms of birds and beasts, luminous as moon essence. When blended with the juice of the Heartless Grass, it instantly becomes liquid; consuming one *dou* grants a thousand years of life.\n\n*The Catalog of Numinous Treasure Zhi*\n*The Five Sacred Peaks in Pictorial Form*\n\nThe Zhi that is born together with Heaven and Earth is placed in the offices of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Grotto-Courts, where perfected transcendents and flying immortals dwell. The divine herb Jade Zhi upon its heights grants men immortality.\n\n*Wondrous Sayings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi*\n\n**Stone Zhi**\nGrows on secluded mountains by the sea where stones accumulate. Its form has head and tail, four feet—red as coral, white as silver fat, black as lacquer-dyed silk, blue as kingfisher plumes, yellow as gold—radiant and translucent as solid ice. On dark nights, its light is visible from a hundred paces. The largest weigh over ten *jin*. To refine Stone-Image Zhi, pound it thirty-six thousand times; consume a square-inch spoonful, and after finishing one *jin*, one gains a hundred thousand years of life. It also grows on high mountains near water, shaped like plates or bowls, no more than a foot in diameter, with seven apertures called Seven Luminaries or nine apertures called Nine Radiants, all shining like stars. These one hundred twenty kinds are all Stone Zhi, recorded in the *Jade Strategies of the Great One*.\n\n**Wood Zhi**\nPine resin transformed after a thousand years, shaped like a lotus blossom, called Wood Might-Joy. It glows when viewed at night and, when worn, repels weapons. Its root resembles a seated person, seven feet long; when carved, it bleeds. Applied to the feet, one may walk upon water; applied to the body, one becomes invisible. Mixed with giant sesame and used to illuminate the ground at night, if gold or jade treasures lie buried, the light turns azure and droops downward. Consuming ten *jin* grants a thousand years of life. When pine resin ages three thousand years, its bark contains congealed fat shaped like a dragon, called Qi-Node Zhi, weighing ten *jin*; consuming one *jin* grants five hundred years. Fan-Tao Zhi resembles a rising dragon, its blossoms like cinnabar gauze, its fruit like green-black birds, five feet tall, growing on the shady side of famous mountains above flowing streams. Consuming one stalk grants five thousand years. Great Spring Zhi is a parasite on large trees, resembling a lotus flower, with a sweet and pungent taste. Jian-Fruit Zhi is the fruit of the Jian Tree, growing in Du-Guang, its bark like a tassel snake, its fruit like a *yue* bird. When these Zhi are blended and consumed, one ascends in broad daylight.\n\n**Herb Zhi**\nSolitary-Sway Zhi moves without wind, its stem red as cinnabar, its root as large as a *kui* measure, or as small as a chicken’s egg. Twelve stems encircle a single large root, which grows on Tiger-Longevity Mountain at Wu Slope, resembling ox horns, three to four feet long, azure in color. Consuming a square-inch spoonful grants a thousand years. Hemp-Mother Zhi has purple blossoms. Pearl Zhi has a yellow stem and red leaves, its fruit like plums, purple, twenty-four strung like beads. White-Tally Zhi resembles a plum, blooming in heavy snow and bearing fruit in late winter. Nine-Bend Vermilion Grass has nine curves, each bearing three fruits. Five-Hearing Zhi resembles a tower, its stem square, its leaves in five colors like an inverted canopy, with sweet dew and purple qi rising several feet. Dragon-Street Zhi sprouts in pairs at three nodes during mid-spring, twelve in total. All Herb Zhi, when consumed, grant either a thousand or two thousand years of life.\n\n**Fungus Zhi**\nShaped like palaces, carriages, dragons, tigers, or flying birds, in five colors without constancy, comprising one hundred ten kinds. Those who consume them ascend as immortals; the middling gain several thousand years, the lesser a thousand years.\n\n**Lotus Fruit**\nAlso called Water Zhi, paired with the osprey’s head as yin and yang. On the *wu* day of the eighth month, gather lotus seeds; on the morning of the ninth month, gather lotus roots, dry them in the shade by degree for a hundred days, and prepare them. On the *mao* day of the first month at dawn, consume a square-inch spoonful with well-flower water four or five times daily for a hundred days to cure all illnesses; prolonged consumption leads to transcendence.\n\n*Five Talismans*\n*Grade Nine: Food and Goods*\n\n**Islands and Treasures of the Sea**\nThe seas contain hundreds and thousands of islands, abundant with rare treasures. *Record of Resolve*\n\nOn **Lingwu Mountain** amid the great sea, there naturally arise gold, silver, pearls, jade, giant clams, agate, coral, and countless wondrous treasures—hundreds of thousands of kinds. *Inner Transmission of the Divine Lord*\n\n**The Blade of Xiwu**\nThough but ten inches long, it cleaves jade.\n\n**Flowing-Star Metal**\nThough no larger than a mustard seed, it pierces all sight. *Five Talismans*\n\n**A Hall Filled with Gold and Jade**\nNone can long preserve it.\n\n**Ten Ounces of Purple Gold**\nUsed to swear oaths before the Nine Heavens, transmitted according to the *Luminous Regulations of the Nine Perfected*. *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles*\n\n**Fifty Catties of Yellow Gold**\nTo succor and benefit the common people. *Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor of Great Clarity*\n\n**Scholars of the Highest Study**\nPrepare one gold fish, one jade dragon, and three ounces of superior gold to offer to the master of scriptures, the Golden Perfected and Jade Radiance.\n\nTo receive the *Ten Sections of Wondrous Scriptures of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure*, use nine ounces of superior gold to swear oaths before the Nine Heavens, and employ two gold dragons, nine gold clasps, casting them into mountains, waters, or earth as tokens. *Regulations of Luminous Perfection*\n\n**Scholars of the Highest Immortality**\n\nInscribe this upon silver tablets for the longevity of the Upper and Lower Immortals. The Three Great Spirits sigh in timely response: within the Five Marchmounts, the great treasuries of gold, silver, jade marrow, and lapis lazuli burst forth in radiance, illuminating the ten directions. The Eight Sea Spirit-Kings emerge from the azure depths bearing coral trees, five million *li* in height, their seven-jeweled blossoms and leaves overspreading the vast ocean. The heavens of the Three Realms rain fine luminous pearls, while the Five Marchmounts reveal the divine immortal mountain treasuries, their five-hued beauteous jades gleaming with inexhaustible splendor. *Scripture of the Womb-Dwelling Karma*\n\n**Realm of Lapis Lazuli**\nIt is said the land of this realm is entirely of lapis lazuli.\n\n**Radiant Youths**\nFollowing the sun and moon in their revolutions, three thousand six hundred in crimson robes, they descend to the dark sea and stir the golden essence and purple-light jades. *Three Sovereigns*\n\n**Liberation Through This Scripture**\nAll within the Three Realms are bound by affinity. The heavens and peoples offer fragrant flowers, seven-jeweled thrones, gold and silver, pearls and jades, coral, and agate. *Original Beginning’s Wisdom, Right Contemplation, and

He once dwelt in the cold valleys of Eastern Grove—now he is rewarded with the Purple Tassel’s staff, the Lotus-Blossom Crown, to summon a thousand spirits and command clouds upon the mountains. He forsook his home to wander alone—thus he is granted the embroidered feathers, the purple mantle, the cinnabar and azure flying skirts, to ascend the celestial steps at ease, bearing the mandate of the Jade Perfected. He traversed deep thickets—thus he is rewarded with the Spotted Dragon’s chariot, the White Tiger’s plow, to float in revelry through the great void, his flying wheels gracing the imperial court. He endured frost and snow—thus he is granted the Curved Dawn’s precious canopy, the Jasper Curtains, the Crimson Chamber, to roam and gaze upon the Nine Palaces in serene warmth. He concealed his form in secluded peaks, his spirit contemplating the myriad groves—thus he is rewarded with the Divine Flowing Fire Bell, the Twin Pearls of Bright Moon, to ascend and report to the Great Ultimate, to convey his voice to the Supreme Clarity. His true heart is lofty and still—thus he is granted the brocade banner, the embroidered pennant, the white feathered black staff, to summon the Six Yin and the Jade Maidens to attend his carriage. His kindness extends to all things, his hidden virtue governs the myriad beings—thus he is rewarded with the Phoenix’s flute, the golden bell, the jade chime, to harmonize the spirits in the empty halls, to delight the Perfected and dance with the numinous. No being can disrupt his resonance, no thousand evils can enslave his purity—thus he is rewarded with the Purple Essence’s marrow, the Jade Nectar, the Golden Infant, to share the lifespan of the Three Luminaries, to inscribe his name upon the Cinnabar Jade. Ying’s heart shines with the radiance of the sun, his spirit leaps with the great aurora—he has redeemed the longevity of others, thus he is styled ‘Great Profundity.’ With the nine virtues complete, he is now instructed in nine affairs, granted forty Jade Boys and forty Jade Maidens to attend his comings and goings in the Great Reverence, to receive affairs from the Great Ultimate, and to govern the office of the Red City Jade Grotto’s府.

      "translated_text": "**The Ancient Register of the Mysterious Capital Purple Tenuity Palace**, also called *The Eight Dragon Script*. *The Numinous Treasure Vermilion Writ* for \"Opening the Heart and Dispelling Delusion\" is to be inscribed in cinnabar on an auspicious day and ingested. The incantation reads:\n\n*\"Five spirits open the heart,\nThree souls gather essence.\"*\n\nMaster Han Zhong of the Nine Doubts received this scripture from Song Dexuan of Mount Song. Dexuan, having ingested the *Six Jia Spirit-Flight Talisman*, could traverse over three thousand *li* in a single day.\n\n**The Four Transformative Talismans**\nIn spring, ingest the *Eastern Brilliance Communion-with-the-True Transformative Radiant Yang Mist Talisman*;\nIn summer, ingest the *Southern Radiance Eightfold-Refinement Elixir Transformative Fourfold Clarity Talisman*;\nIn autumn, ingest the *Western Essence Vast-Spirit Transformative Radiance Talisman*;\nIn winter, ingest the *Northern Mystery Profound-True Refinement Transformative Whistling Wind Talisman*.\n\nTo practice the Way of the Yellow Emperor, ingest the *Yellow Supreme Eight Scriptures Life-Radiance Jade Gate Talisman* on the days of the *li* months.\n\n**Eastern Brilliance Communion-with-the-True Talisman**\nThe essence of the Eastern Azure Radiant Yang Mist, *Opening Brilliance and Communing with Light*, is the primal glow of the origin’s dawn, illuminating the Eastern Heaven. It surges through ninety-nine myriad million layers, where flocks of jade-green fowl perch in verdant groves. Above lies the *Origin Azure* abode; within stands the *Azure Splendor* palace. The abode is graced by the *Nine Qi Primordial Elders*; the palace houses the *Azure Perfected Sage Lords*. To their right attend the *Azure Waist Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Kingfisher-Feather Divine Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of Mount Tai, driving and guiding the nine-light divine dragons. In the third month of spring, they descend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens, congealing qi into names and condensing essence into talismans. He who swallows this qi may instantly establish a divine body; he who cools this essence may transform into ninefold radiance—its wonders defy full description.\n\n**Southern Radiance Eightfold-Refinement Talisman**\nThe essence of the Southern *Fourfold Clarity* is the primal glow of the eight heavens’ trigrams, scattering through eighty-eight myriad million layers like flourishing auspicious clouds, resplendent in the court of the *Great Mystery*. Jade nectar cascades in the land of flowing fire, where the *Great Yang* holds the *Gushing Mouth* cavern, and the *Flowing Fire* abounds with deathless ones. Above stands the *Southern Culmen* terrace; within lies the *Cavern Yang* palace. The terrace is governed by the *Controller of Immortals and Life Mandates*; the palace contains the *Supreme Harmony Perfected*. To their right attend the *Great Perfected Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Vermilion Brilliance Divine Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of Mount Huo, driving and guiding the nine-colored phoenixes. In the third month of summer, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw the brilliance of the *Crimson Palace*. The two qi intersect in responsive transformation, their changes emerging from subtle glimmers. Essence condenses into script; qi congeals into stars. He who swallows this qi will have numinous lords descend to his chamber; he who cools this essence may soar through the eight voids, command the *Six Jia*, and dispatch the *Six Ding*.\n\n**Western Essence Vast-Spirit Transformative Radiance Supportive Talisman**\nIts script is the essence-qi of the Western *Vast-Spirit Metal Soul Sun Gate*, the primal glow of the sixfold golden radiance. Brightly it illumines the Western Rong, vast and flowing through sixty-six myriad million layers. Its essence falls like jade, driving light and streaming luster, pouring into the *Smelting Refinement* court. There lies the *Returning Countenance* pool, the *Refined Immortal* gem, and the *Gold Gate* with its azure-gold cinnabar. Above stands the *Dragon Mountain* divine tower; within lies the *Plain Spirit* palace. The tower is graced by the *Twelve King Immortals*; the palace shelters the *Western Florescence Perfected*. To their right attend the *Plain Spirit Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Gold Florescence Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of Mount Che, driving and guiding the *White Emperor’s* kings. In the third month of autumn, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens. The two qi respond and intersect, congealing essence into talismans and condensing qi into spirits. He who swallows this qi will instantly summon a divine countenance; he who cools this essence may soar through the *Gold Gate*, sit and summon the ten directions, and summon clouds to bring forth dragons.\n\n**Northern Mystery Refinement Transformative Talisman**\nThe essence of the Northern *Profound-True Whistling Wind Florescence Dawn* is the primal glow of the opening of yin and yang. Its radiance is chaotic, now merging, now parting, scattering and flowing through fifty-five myriad million layers. Its essence is profoundly interwoven, like the dark clouds’ distant smoke merging with blossoms yet unshining. It engenders the five phases and establishes the *Mysterious Beginning*, where yin generates the *Refined Immortal Jade Paste* and the *Cold Water* holds the *Demon-Quelling King*. Above stands the *Sevenfold Divine Flower Canopy*; within lies the *Crossing Spirit* hall, which shelters the *August Jade Dawn*. To their right attend the *Great Mystery Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Jade Dawn Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of Mount Da, driving and guiding the flying tortoises and purple wheels. In the third month of winter, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens, congealing essence into script and condensing qi into immortals. He who swallows this qi will have the *Seven Dawns* descend to his chamber; he who ingests this essence may reverse and transform yin and yang. Such are the wonders of the *August Numinous Script*.\n\n**Yellow Supreme Eight Scriptures Talisman**\nThe essence of the *Central Yellow Supreme Divine Mother Jade Gate Life-Radiance Communing Brilliance* is the primal glow of heaven and earth’s warp and woof, the twelve celestial stems. It illumines the eight directions, its mist wafting and scattering, its light brilliant and merging with the void. It surges and rises in the capital of the *Great Mystery*, threading through twelve myriad million layers, its flowing nectar overflowing in the land of the four seasons. Above stands the *Royal Capital* palace; within lies the *Leather Canopy* palace. The former is governed by the *Supreme Dao Lord*; the latter contains the *Wood Dawn Lord*. To their left attend the *Flying Immortals with Feathered Staffs* and the *Azure Florescence Jade Maidens*; to their right, the *Commanding Immortal Jade Gentlemen* and the *Golden Bell Divine Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of the *Nine Wastes*, driving and guiding the *Yellow Supreme* dragons. They gather the five qi to revolve the celestial stems, commanding the twelve *Polar Arrays*, ascending to guide the source and flow of the Nine Heavens, and descending to draw the yellow spirit of the spleen. The two qi intersect above the *Muddy Pellet*, refining and transforming in the chamber of the *Three Cinnabar Fields*. Essence congeals to transform spirits; qi condenses to refine immortals. He who swallows this qi will have the *Yellow Elder* descend in form; he who cools this essence will radiate the color of *vajra*. Myriad marvels transform, and one may soar through the Great Void. The wondrous efficacy of this numinous script defies measure.\n\nVirtue is the father;\nSpiritual illumination, the mother.\nPurity and quiescence, the teacher;\nSupreme harmony, the friend.\nThe horse and tiger are dragons,\nAnd one becomes coeval with heaven and earth.\nTo be mysterious and silent\nIs to exhaust the Dao.\nWithout goodness, one does not act;\nWithout harmony, one does not speak.",

The Most High August Emperor refines the Supreme Perfected through ninefold refinement.\n\nThe mouth and tongue are the palace of calamity, the mansion of peril and ruin. Speech is the repository of great destiny, the domain of punishment and misfortune. When the sage speaks, he fears that his words may stray from the wondrous truth. Though literary eloquence fills heaven and earth, when the worthy and sagely speak—\n\nTo a lord, their words bring grace to the state;\nTo a father, kindness to his child;\nTo a teacher, love to the multitude;\nTo brothers, fraternal conduct in action;\nTo a minister, loyalty to his sovereign;\nTo a ruler, filial piety to his parents;\nTo a friend, trust in their bond;\nTo a wife, chastity to her husband;\nTo a husband, harmony in the household;\nTo a younger sibling, reverence in ritual;\nTo a rustic, encouragement in farming;\nTo a Daoist, rectitude in the Dao;\nTo one of a foreign land, each guards their own realm;\nTo servants and maids, caution in their duties.\n\nThe Dark Lord of the Northern Cavern, the Solitary and Uttermost, the Five Numinous Ones, the Mysterious Elder—his surname is Hao, his style Fuming. Scion of the Mysterious August, descendant of the Grand Clarity, at the age of twelve in the midst of the Azure Heaven, his heart delighted in mountains and waters. After a thousand days he returned, and beneath the Mirror Mountain he encountered a field of lettuce. He gathered it to relieve the destitute, yet after three years his task remained unfinished, and he perished at the mountain’s foot. The Nine Heavens inscribed his yang virtue; the golden tablets recorded his jade name. His ethereal soul was conveyed to the Palace of Vermilion Clarity, where the Emperor dispatched the Golden-Winged Great Roc to spread its mighty wings over his corpse. Seven hundred years passed until the water kalpa altered the cosmic tide, and his remains drifted into boundless depths. When the waters receded, they came to rest upon the Northern Black Mound. Thirty years later, a great mountain fire raged, and he was refined in its flames before rising again, a five-colored cloud canopy above him. The Primordial Beginning bestowed upon him the *Lingbao Crimson Writ of the Five Qi of the Mysterious Heaven*, the true scripture of the Black Emperor of the North.\n\nSome sold themselves to sustain the Dharma; some cast themselves before hungry tigers; some carved their flesh to feed the birds. Their utmost sincerity moved the Great Void; their hidden virtue harmonized with the Three Luminaries.

Kindly opening expedient means, great compassion pervades all. Dispelling greed and lust, calming wrath and affliction, eradicating perverse folly, extinguishing the three poisons—these four deeds are the forerunners of the Six Perfections.\n\nMen and women each contend in their intentions; four horses pass like a crack in the wall—yet even this is slow. Compared to them, the fleeting question of a cloud is swift as lightning, yet neither matches the speed of thought. To master the heart is more difficult than taming tigers and leopards. Apes, monkeys, deer, and horses are all easily controlled. Only the supremely sagely can truly govern the heart.\n\nRectify the spirits, rectify the heart; rectify conduct, rectify the body. Heavenly spirits revere them; earthly spirits guard them. The discipline of cultivating the heart and entering the Dao unfolds in myriad branches. From beginning to end, steadfast in integrity, they guide in hidden transformation; in advance and retreat, harmonizing their light, they teach in secret practice. Eating but once at midday, they maintain purity in their person. Even gold must not be defiled—how much more the Supreme Dao!",

The people of Tianzhu (India) say: the five fragrant herbs repel malign qi, stabilize the hun and po souls, subdue demonic entities, and summon numinous perfected beings. This herb grows abundantly east of the Canglang River, where the divine beings of the East each transform into *qingmu* incense.\n\nWhen one burns *qingmu*, *xunlu* (frankincense), and *anxi* resin in the bedchamber, it dispels the foulness of the Five Turbidities and the demonic qi of the earth, which would otherwise rise straight up to the heavens for forty *li*. The smoke of this incense shatters the filth of turbid qi and parts the mists of evil demons. Heavenly beings and jade maidens, the Supreme Unity Emperor Lord, follow the fragrant vapors to rest upon one’s face and form.\n\nScholars of the highest learning ingest the radiance of the sun and moon, the flying roots of golden essence. The Way of the Yellow Qi: on the morning of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), boil *baizhi* (angelica), peach bark, and *qingmu*, then bathe facing east. On *jiazi* days, one should bathe.\n\n*The Precious Divine Daily Record of the Queen Mother of the West* states:\nOn the first, fifteenth, and twenty-third days of each month, draw water from three rivers (or three wells, as some say). Measure the water in a *hu* vessel, then boil one *liang* each of *jishe* (clove), *qingmu*, *lingling* (lemongrass), *xunlu*, and *chenxiang* (aloeswood). Inscribe the *Tongming* talisman upon the water and use it for bathing. First, face east and knock the teeth twenty-four times, visualizing the Seven Stars above the nape, a canopy of purple mist filling the room, divine youths scattering incense to the left, and jade maidens holding towels to the right. Upon completion, recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The Three Luminaries shine brightly,\nThe Five Spirits become serene.\nThe heavens bear no floating haze,\nThe earth stirs no flying dust.\nBathe in the Eastern Well,\nReceive and reverse your form.\nBody fragrant, bones aromatic,\nAscend to the Jade Court.\nHaving received the Supreme Perfected,\nCast the talisman into the well.\"*\n\nThis is the supreme method of imperial bathing, transmitted from the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning to the Heavenly Emperor of Unity. Through cultivation, the Emperor Lord attained flowing purple radiance to crown his imperial form. The Supreme Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen refined it to emit an upper fragrance heard across the Three Clarities. The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity cultivated it, and the divine mushrooms of the Five Directions gathered in his chamber. The Golden Gate Lord of the Supreme Sages developed a royal glow upon his face. The Prime Minister Azure Lad refined it, and his fragrance suffused the Three Clarities. This secret Way resides within the Purple Chamber of the Southern Culmen.\n\nBathing in the Orchid Pool above,\nDragons bear the long-handled vase.\nGolden youths scatter fragrant blossoms,\nJade maidens stream the Five Stars.\nCrown and sash washed in jade nectar,\nRefining and transcending the Five Immortals’ forms.\nBody fragrant, myriad spirits descend,\nRiding the light to ascend the lofty clarity.\n\nBathe at the Golden Gate,\nCrown and sash aglow with divine radiance.\nThe Jade Void seals the talisman,\nAll immortals converge in return.\nHeavenly officials and their retinues\nFeast and wander the Three Clarities, ascending the Dark Peak.\n\nThe Supreme Unity Emperor Lord regards the Purple Chamber as the Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, the Three Wombs as divine luminaries. The Eight Pure Ones adorn the Mysterious, with true contemplation as their foremost; the esoteric words and wondrous essentials are the *Inner Canon of the Nine Perfected*. The divine method takes pure thought as its deepest core, and the youthful adept takes thorough realization as attaining the numinous. The *Great Cavern* takes the exalted as its origin, the *Great Elixir* takes the Feminine One as its inner essence, the Five Elders take spontaneity as their morning bones, the Supreme Lord takes the Non-Beflowered as the Mysterious Clarity, the Yellow Venerable takes will and nature as the root of the Dao, the White Prime takes immaculate cultivation as entry into the real, perfected beings take qi-convergence as mutual refinement, and the essentials of immortality take essence-response as the completion of the Dao.\n\n*Jingzi* (Essence Son), *Chengzi* (Sincerity Son), *Shenrongzi* (Spirit Glory Son), *Zhongzi* (Central Son), *Hezi* (Harmony Son), *Daonaihuazi* (Dao-Transforming Son):\nSincerity is the gateway of the spirit. It accomplishes what cannot be accomplished, guards what cannot be guarded. Ascending the Mysterious—there is being in non-being, non-being in non-non-being. Neither being nor non-being, it circulates through the Nine Extremes. Proceeding without cease, contemplating without weariness.\n\nThe five viscera within the body correspond to the Five Peaks. Learning is like the midday sun—before study, all is dark and obscure; this is the first stage of enlightenment. In learning, one must be precise and cannot be unclear, then one may fathom the wonders of the Three Clarities. Confine a thousand evils in the prison of the Eight Wastes, seal ten thousand demons at the ends of the Nine Distances. When the heart is upright, heaven and earth cannot oppose it. Constantly guard the Nine Hun souls to seek flying immortality.\n\nThe Great Unity abides peacefully in the Six Dwellings,\nThe Five Numinous Ones guard the Three Mouths.\nThe Three Officials refine and harmonize,\nThe five viscera are at peace and inquire no further.\nSecure them with divine medicines,\nNourish the cloud-body.\n\nWhat scholars cannot learn,\nWhere others cannot dwell—\nthe true and spontaneous One.\nA tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a hair’s tip;\nThe smoke of ascending clouds arises from a spark’s flame.\n\n*The Regulations of the Supreme Perfected*:\nEvil accumulates and leads to death—\nthe suffering of death is lamentable.\nGood accumulates and leads to long life—\nthe joy of life is cause for celebration.\nAccomplish three thousand merits to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\nAccomplish three hundred good deeds to attain earthly immortality.\nTo learn the Way of ascending as an immortal, one must perform six thousand two hundred good deeds.\nWith surplus in cultivation,\nHeaven sends a cloud chariot.\nThose who magnify the Dao do not perish,\nAttaining deathlessness by their own efforts.\n\nThe Way of Great Compassion\nTakes saving others as its priority.\nWithout merit, there is no reward;\nWithout virtue, no promotion;\nWithout trust, no salvation;\nWithout practice, no immortality.\nThose who establish merit and virtue\nDo so for heaven and earth,\nFor the Three Luminaries,\nFor the emperor,\nFor the myriad people,\nFor ancestral generations,\nFor all beings,\nAnd for themselves.\n\nExhale and inhale primordial harmony,\nSip and rinse with flowing rosy clouds.\nThe essence of the Five Flowers—\nthe question of the Immortal Duke.",

Commanding the Six Jia spirits, they set the stars in motion. Summoning the Three Sovereigns, they dispatch ghosts and spirits, and life’s bones daily renew. With focused and silent contemplation, the Primordial Elder bestows the jade talisman in Nanyang; the August Emperor inscribes the purple name in the Cinnabar Numinosity. Engraved in the Western Terrace’s chambers, fixed in the Eastern Flower’s abode, they harmonize with the qi of the Three Simplicities. Gazing upward, one beholds the radiance of the morning lamp.

Grace flows through the nine marshes, and blessings surge through the mysterious and plain.\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Spirit Generation* arises from the soaring, arcane qi of the Three Caverns. Threefold harmonies form its sound, coalescing into numinous script. It unites the hundred spirits, concealing their inner names through kalpas. Reciting the *Celestial Treasure* illumines the light of heaven and earth; reciting the *Numinous Treasure* awakens the souls of the Nine Dark Realms from eternal night; reciting the *Spiritual Treasure* governs the ten thousand spirits; reciting the *Grand Unity* delivers the body’s spirits; reciting the *Nine Heavens* generates life. When one recites it once, the sound ascends to the Nine Heavens, the Golden Towers and Jade Halls, the Twelvefold Gates, the Purple Portals and Jade Pavilions, the thirty-six thousand barriers. The Grand Unity confers talismans; the Primordial Lord grants life. Jade lads and maidens serve east and west, galloping in dragon chariots to ascend at dawn to the Nine Heavens’ spirit generation.\n\nThe *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Its Virtue*:\nThe superior adept, upon receiving its rhymes, becomes a Celestial King of the Most High;\nthe middling adept, upon reciting it, becomes a flying immortal;\nthe lesser adept, upon reciting it, becomes a Wheel-Turning Sage King.\nThe Heavenly Emperor’s numinous chariot welcomes their ethereal spirits.\nAbove, it extols the new bestowals of the Primordial Lord;\nbelow, it celebrates the great compassion of the divine perfected teachings.\nThis path, when one supplicates the Five Chapters, the *Numinous Writ of the Great Emperor*, and recites the *Five Thousand Characters* ten thousand times, summons the descent of the Most High’s cloud-dragon in welcome. For those who have not yet departed, recite it thrice a month.\n\nThe *Supreme Ultimate’s Esoteric Annotations and Treasured Instructions*:\nOn the half-month, one’s fate-day, the eight solar terms, at noon and midnight, receive and recite the *Five Thousand Characters*.

      "translated_text": "Bocheng Qinsheng inquired of the Way of Yunfang and the secrets of the Three Perfections. The Jade Emperor and the White and Two Purities are the Lord Emperors of the body, the primal perfected ones among the hundred spirits.\n\nNow, to assist the solitary and examine the upright, the Three Sovereigns settle within, the Great One preserves the embryo, and the Five Elders refine the essence. The One abides in the Cinnabar Field, where the Controller of Destiny guards life. The One dwells in the Crimson Palace, where purple qi bathes the form. The One is honored in the Grotto Chamber, where the Three Simplicities merge in radiance. The Cloud Palace of the Hall of Light, the Purple Gate and Jade Portal, the Yellow Watchtower and Golden Chamber, the Jade City and Vermilion Window—these are the inner abodes of the Imperial One, the treasure chambers of the Three Perfected.\n\nThus, the single scene of Yunfang blends spirit and human, ascending to Kunlun above and descending to the Pure Springs below. Cloud canopies rise in towering majesty, forests and bamboos flourish in verdant splendor. The Seven Numinous Spirits revolve, the Three Colors entwine, and layered towers of ten thousand tiers form mist in three years. The Jade Watchtower stands in serene emptiness, the Seven Gates lie in profound depths. Golden doors and jade cabinets hold the talismanic registers in five scrolls. The undifferentiated takes form—summoning yang and calling forth yin.\n\nThe Three-in-One is the numinous origin of the body, the root of life for the hundred spirits, the mountain source of fluids, the royal chamber of soul and essence. The stomach’s pool is square to receive things, the brain’s palace is empty and round to accommodate the perfected. Ten thousand hairs stand erect, a thousand pores generate breath. Virtue fills Heaven and Earth, rank equals the Great Mystery.\n\nAbove the space between the brows lies the Cinnabar Field Palace, where the Red Child dwells. The heart is the Middle Cinnabar Field Palace, where the Perfected One dwells. Three inches below the navel is the Lower Cinnabar Field Palace, where the Infant Brother dwells. These together form the Three Cinnabar Fields.\n\nThe head contains nine palaces: three inches inward from between the brows is the Upper Twin Cinnabar Fields; one inch inward is the Hall of Light Palace; three inches inward is the Grotto Chamber Palace; three inches inward is the Cinnabar Field Palace; one inch above the Four Halls is the Heavenly Court Palace; one inch above the Grotto Chamber is the Flowing Pearl Palace; five inches inward is the Jade Emperor. Above the Hall of Ultimate Perfection is the Mystic Pearl Palace, one inch above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme August Palace.\n\nAbove the space between the brows, within it lie the Yellow Watchtower and Purple Gate, the Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber. Together they stand guard. The Azure Chamber’s great spirit is named *Zhengxin* (\"Upright Heart\"), styled *Chufang* (\"Primal Square\"). Within the Cinnabar Field Palace, the Lord Emperor is ever present; within the guarded inch, the great spirit is ever present.\n\nThe Most High said: The reason the Perfected One values the One as the True One is simply this—it is the One alone. The One’s resonance with the Great Void stirs unity; the One’s transformations align with the Heavenly Dao in profound accord. The Upper One is the Heavenly Emperor of the body, the Middle One is the Cinnabar Sovereign of the Crimson Palace, the Lower One is the Primal King of the Yellow Court. The true essence of the One oversees and governs the fourteen qi within the body, corresponding above to the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Grand Tenuity.\n\nWhen true qi circulates in harmony, the two substances take form. The mysterious spirit blends and divides, the Purple Chamber lies in deep obscurity. The Upper One is the ultimate of the Perfected Emperor, the Middle One is the perfection of the Perfected King, the Lower One is the subtlety of the Perfected King. The Heavenly Sovereign attains the Upper One and becomes the August Ultimate; the Earthly Sovereign attains the perfection of the Upper One and becomes the One; the Human Sovereign attains the subtlety of the Upper One and dwells among the myriad subtleties.\n\nJuzi transmitted this.",

      "translated_text": "Su Lin guarded the Dao of the Three Perfected and the Primal One. He informed Lin: \"I have been summoned by the August Lord to serve as Grand Master of the Four Offices of the Central Yellow, governing the Northern Sea.\" Later, he left behind a single document, which read: \"The Five Pecks and Three Ones are secrets of the Supreme Emperor. After twenty years of concentrated contemplation, the Three Ones appeared. I now transmit this scripture to you. If you can guard the Three Ones, your name will be inscribed on the Jade Tablets.\n\n\"Should you abide in the Grotto Chamber as a Minister of the Upper Clarity and be further enlightened regarding the Three Origins to become one of the Five August Lords, the Golden Portal August Lord of Later Saints shall ascend in radiant clouds, traversing the Ten Great Forests.\n\n\"During the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han, he told his disciple Zhou Jitong: 'Yesterday, I was summoned by the Mystic Province to serve as Perfected Minister of Destiny, Grand Master of the Supreme Ultimate, and Marquis of the Central Office. Tomorrow, a cloud chariot with feathered canopies, drawn by dragons and tigers, accompanied by thousands of attending officers, will come to receive me.' That very day, Lin ascended to heaven, rising slowly toward the northwest, enveloped in clouds and mist.\n\n\"Thus, in the era of the Three Sovereigns, those who studied the Dao all prized the guarding of the One. One must make the heart uncarved and the spirit congealed, the body single-minded in sincere devotion. Let no hundred thoughts arise, and let essence and intent not scatter. If for three months one inwardly gazes and fixes the mind, a single spirit will appear, and the radiance of spirit will transform and coil through the five viscera.\n\n\"After the dispersal of the uncarved and the true, and the latent rise of florid falsity, the One fails to summon response, and spirits do not immediately answer. The method of the Three Ones is the first chapter of the true scriptures of the Golden Portal August Lord of the Upper Clarity of the August Heaven, the ultimate of the most exalted Dao, the ford of divine immortals, the wondrous formula of the host of Perfected.

      "translated_text": "The eastern, western, southern, and northern spans measure two thousand and forty *li*. The walled city has seven concentric layers, each adorned with bamboo, trees, and groves. The city’s four gates enclose pools and forests where phoenixes, vermilion birds, and flying crows dwell—this is the chaotic wind’s domain and the Sun King’s abode.\n\nAt the city’s center stands a palace of yellow gold. On all four sides of the city walls rise golden towers and pavilions, their heights and depths spanning forty *li*. On the fiftieth heaven, beings descend to become the Sun Heavenly King, radiating great luminosity that illuminates the golden towers on all sides, generating five hundred beams of light to shine upon the four directions. The celestial beings of these heavens live for nine million years.\n\nThe Perfected of the Nine Heavens call the sun *Zhuóyào Luó*; the Perfected of the Three Heavens call it *Yuánguāng Wèi*; in the Heaven of Grand Simplicity, it is named *Miàojǐng*; the Supreme Perfected call it *Jiǔyào Shēng*. The Supreme Perfected constantly rides the luminous jade wheel, feasting within the sun. The immortals of Great Clarity call the sun *Dàmíng*; the Perfected of the Great Ultimate call it *Míngyuán*.\n\nIn the primordial era, within the Heaven of Purple Prime, there was ever a radiant glow, thin as mist—this was the origin of the nine suns, their light akin to that of a single moon. In the Heaven of Jade Worthies, the sun is called *Wēixuán*.\n\nThe radiance of the sun and moon is the effulgent bloom of their numinous brilliance. The Crimson Qi King is the divine spirit above the sun, named *Jiāngchē Liángzhī*. Those who know the name of the Crimson Qi King will not die but ascend to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Lord Lao calls the sun *Tàibǎo*; the Nine Radiance Eastern Perfected call it *Zǐyào Míng*, or sometimes *Yuánmèi*.\n\nThe sun’s essence is crimson, square in form yet round in radiance. Each month, it passes five times above the Golden Gate, where the essence of gold, stone radiance, and the water-mother’s flower are refined within the sun’s soul, casting forth eight rays of luminous essence.\n\nThe Cinnabar Crucible’s cinnabar qi nurtures celestial essence, firm yet receptive to the yielding. The yin bloom of scorching water, the sun’s primal radiance, is called *Dàmíng*. Nine yang forces coalesce, and twin vapors arise together. Concentrating the spirit and harmonizing the soul, the essence of harmonious qi gives birth to the Five Emperors within. They ride the light to govern form, their heads crowned with dragon-flower kerchiefs, clad in crimson sashes and azure robes. Simurghs and crows flow in mystery, their rosy glow suffusing the azure above.\n\nThe Azure Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Yuáncháng Yuán* and courtesy name *Zhàolóng Tāo*, wears a robe of azure-jade brocade and a cape of verdant, feathered splendor.\n\nThe Vermilion Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Dānlíng Zhì* and courtesy name *Lǜhóng Yìng*, wears a robe of crimson-jade brocade and a cape of vermilion, feathered splendor.\n\nThe White Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Hàoyù Jiāng* and courtesy name *Huíjīn Xiá*, wears a robe of white-jade brocade and a cape of white, feathered splendor.\n\nThe Black Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Chéngcáo Tíng* and courtesy name *Xuánlǜ Yán*, wears a robe of black-jade brocade and a cape of black, feathered splendor.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Shòuyì Fù* and courtesy name *Piāohuī Xiàng*, wears a robe of yellow-jade brocade and a cape of yellow, feathered splendor.\n\nThe sun’s inner spirit, the Lady of the Solar Soul, is named *Àixiāo Tái* and governs the Nine Perfected within.\n\nThe moon’s domain lies in the north, corresponding to the *zǐ* position; thus, in the eleventh month, the myriad things germinate beneath the earth. The moon’s breadth spans two thousand nine hundred *li*, while its radiant circumference measures seven thousand eight hundred and forty *li*. Within, white silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal reflect one another, divided into sixty parts, their scorching brilliance illuminating the interior. The city walls and populace are arrayed with seven-jeweled bathing pools and forests of eight *qiān* trees growing within.\n\nThe people of the moon stand sixteen feet tall, clad in garments of azure hue. From the first to the sixteenth day of the month, they gather white silver and lapis lazuli, refining them in the crucible of scorching light—thus, as the moon waxes, its luminosity grows bright and vast. From the seventeenth to the twenty-ninth day, beneath the *qiān* forests, they gather the blossoms of the three qi to brush the light of the sun and moon.\n\nOn the autumnal equinox, the moon lodges above the Eastern Well in the Hall of Vast Spirit, bathing in the Eastern Well’s pool to refine the lunar soul, brightening the eightfold radiance of clarity. It receives the yang essence from the sun’s brilliance and exhales yellow qi into the Jade Pool. All celestial beings gather the blossoms of the jade trees to brush the light of the sun and moon, while the moon’s yellow qi washes the countenances of the heavenly beings.

To the southeast, its towers link the auroras of Yang; above, it adjoins the gates of the Azure Palace’s divine emperors. To the northwest lies the wilderness of Broad Cold; above, it connects to the divine precincts of the Golden Watchtower’s immortals. Southward, it extends to the realm of Great Cinnabar and Pure Profit; its qi harmonizes with the radiance of Cavern Yang. Northward, it points toward the Celestial Net, intersecting the Plain Canopy, its qi traversing the expanse of Vast Spirit.\n\nAt its center, it directly pierces the Eight Simplicities Wind Mountain of Jade Capital. Its summit levels with heaven at thirty myriad li. Walls of yellow gold, gates of green jade, golden terraces and jade towers, twelve divine palaces. Above stand halls of spontaneous flowing essence and Purple Watchtowers of Golden Florescence, chambers of jasper and chalcedony. Flanking it are the Nine Caverns; spontaneously arise clouds of purple and white. Cliffs birth purple cassia; ridges flourish with jasper groves. Coral forms its branches; jade is planted as its roots. The *qian* trees bear fruit; red youths and white jade rings appear. The Three Florescence bloom in vermilion splendor; returning fragrance flows through the Great Mystery. Eight qi fan the breezes into ceaseless song; jade zithers resound in the void to form music. Dragons roar on cloud-wreathed peaks; phoenixes cry on soaring crags. Venomous beasts array in the thousands; serpents stretch a thousand fathoms. Divine palaces stand majestic; numinous immortals teem in multitudes.

The Perfected of Great Wisdom in the Upper Palace feed upon this radiance, completing their union with heaven.\n\nFrom the *Jade Sleeve of Numinous Treasure*:\n**Method of Ingesting the Teeth’s Qi**\nAt the eight solar nodes, enter the chamber in purity and alignment, visualizing the forms of the Five Elders. Practicing this for eight years, immortal officials and jade maidens will attend you; your body will emanate luminosity, illuminating the ten directions. The Five Thearchs will bow in reverence, and the administrators of the Three Realms will welcome you.\n\n**Five Immortals**\nJade mushrooms in the Mystic Gulf’s depths.\n\nFrom the *Twenty-Four Images of Vital Generation*:\nConstantly contemplate the great sun within the spleen, and within the sun a golden tower, where a book lies sealed with a golden seal, three characters in breadth and length. When the sun’s majesty reveals it, read it aloud—your heart will open, your eyes will brighten, and you will become a transcendent.\n\nFrom the *Laozi’s Observation of Heaven*:\nFocus on the Yellow Field within the stomach—pure white as congealed fat, suffused with yellow qi. When it reaches the mouth, swallow it to attain satiety. This Yellow Field is the Great Granary. All spirits gather there to feast, where a yellow lightning cauldron steams rice, and jade maidens and youths serve as attendants, announcing: “The Yellow Thearch’s child has prepared the traveling kitchen.”\n\n**Guiding Qi Nine Ascents and Nine Descents**\nAfter twelve days, the body lightens; after eighteen days, minor attainment is reached; after thirty-six days, the Dao is greatly accomplished; after eighty days, the head and face radiate light; after one hundred twenty days, one becomes a Perfected.\n\n**Entering the Chamber to Burn Incense**\nFace due south, close the breath, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Visualize as prescribed: *Li* above the head, *Kan* below the navel, *Kun* in the left hand, *Xun* in the right hand, *Qian* beneath the left foot, *Gen* beneath the right foot, *Dui* below the left flank, *Zhen* below the right flank. The eight trigrams manifest their forms, forms contain qi, qi contains spirit. The spirit-person shines with luminosity, arrayed in the eight directions, exhaling generative qi. In spring, *Zhen* governs and engenders fire; in summer, *Li* governs and engenders earth; in autumn, *Dui* governs and engenders water; in winter, *Kan* governs and engenders wood. During the four seasons, *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, and *Xun* govern metal, rotating with the months: *Xun* in the third month, *Kun* in the sixth, *Qian* in the ninth, *Gen* in the twelfth.\n\n**Method of Swallowing the Eight Qi**\nIn the months of *yin* and *mao* (spring), inhale *Zhen* qi three times, then spray high qi nine times; next sip *Xun* qi four times, then *Kun* qi twice; next spray *Qian* qi six times, then sip *Gen* qi eight times, *Dui* qi seven times, and *Kan* qi once. Conclude by knocking the teeth thirty-six times, rubbing the four limbs and five body parts. Practice this during the three or six periods of purification, bowing to the Supreme Eight Simplicities.\n\n**Morning and Evening**\nRecite: *jiazi*, *yichou*, *bingyin*, *dingmao*, *wuchen*, halting at *chen*. Strike the golden beam with jade clappers, circulate the Flowery Pond to recite the Wine Spring, scoop dew from the Boat-Shaving Pool, rinse the mouth’s perimeter, then swallow once after three repetitions—three swallows in total. Perform the *Six Jia* of the Lower Cinnabar as before, totaling thirty swallows to ingest their essential brilliance. The so-called golden beam is the tongue; the jade clappers are the teeth; the Wine Spring, Cinnabar Pond, and Dew Scoop are the saliva in the mouth.\n\nFrom the *Method of Ingesting Qi*:\nAt dawn, consume the qi of the five clouds; at dusk, chant the three dawn-lights.",

      "translated_text": "The Zhi that is born together with Heaven and Earth is placed in the offices of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Grotto-Courts, where perfected transcendents and flying immortals dwell. The divine herb Jade Zhi upon its heights grants men immortality.\n\n*Wondrous Sayings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi*\n\n**Stone Zhi**\nGrows on secluded mountains by the sea where stones accumulate. Its form has head and tail, four feet—red as coral, white as silver fat, black as lacquer-dyed silk, blue as kingfisher plumes, yellow as gold—radiant and translucent as solid ice. On dark nights, its light is visible from a hundred paces. The largest weigh over ten *jin*. To refine Stone-Image Zhi, pound it thirty-six thousand times; consume a square-inch spoonful, and after finishing one *jin*, one gains a hundred thousand years of life. It also grows on high mountains near water, shaped like plates or bowls, no more than a foot in diameter, with seven apertures called Seven Luminaries or nine apertures called Nine Radiants, all shining like stars. These one hundred twenty kinds are all Stone Zhi, recorded in the *Jade Strategies of the Great One*.\n\n**Wood Zhi**\nPine resin transformed after a thousand years, shaped like a lotus blossom, called Wood Might-Joy. It glows when viewed at night and, when worn, repels weapons. Its root resembles a seated person, seven feet long; when carved, it bleeds. Applied to the feet, one may walk upon water; applied to the body, one becomes invisible. Mixed with giant sesame and used to illuminate the ground at night, if gold or jade treasures lie buried, the light turns azure and droops downward. Consuming ten *jin* grants a thousand years of life. When pine resin ages three thousand years, its bark contains congealed fat shaped like a dragon, called Qi-Node Zhi, weighing ten *jin*; consuming one *jin* grants five hundred years. Fan-Tao Zhi resembles a rising dragon, its blossoms like cinnabar gauze, its fruit like green-black birds, five feet tall, growing on the shady side of famous mountains above flowing streams. Consuming one stalk grants five thousand years. Great Spring Zhi is a parasite on large trees, resembling a lotus flower, with a sweet and pungent taste. Jian-Fruit Zhi is the fruit of the Jian Tree, growing in Du-Guang, its bark like a tassel snake, its fruit like a *yue* bird. When these Zhi are blended and consumed, one ascends in broad daylight.\n\n**Herb Zhi**\nSolitary-Sway Zhi moves without wind, its stem red as cinnabar, its root as large as a *kui* measure, or as small as a chicken’s egg. Twelve stems encircle a single large root, which grows on Tiger-Longevity Mountain at Wu Slope, resembling ox horns, three to four feet long, azure in color. Consuming a square-inch spoonful grants a thousand years. Hemp-Mother Zhi has purple blossoms. Pearl Zhi has a yellow stem and red leaves, its fruit like plums, purple, twenty-four strung like beads. White-Tally Zhi resembles a plum, blooming in heavy snow and bearing fruit in late winter. Nine-Bend Vermilion Grass has nine curves, each bearing three fruits. Five-Hearing Zhi resembles a tower, its stem square, its leaves in five colors like an inverted canopy, with sweet dew and purple qi rising several feet. Dragon-Street Zhi sprouts in pairs at three nodes during mid-spring, twelve in total. All Herb Zhi, when consumed, grant either a thousand or two thousand years of life.\n\n**Fungus Zhi**\nShaped like palaces, carriages, dragons, tigers, or flying birds, in five colors without constancy, comprising one hundred ten kinds. Those who consume them ascend as immortals; the middling gain several thousand years, the lesser a thousand years.\n\n**Lotus Fruit**\nAlso called Water Zhi, paired with the osprey’s head as yin and yang. On the *wu* day of the eighth month, gather lotus seeds; on the morning of the ninth month, gather lotus roots, dry them in the shade by degree for a hundred days, and prepare them.
