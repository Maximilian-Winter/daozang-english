The oral instructions are suspected to be a forgery from the Sui or Tang dynasties. One scroll. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Zhongjie* Category.\n\n**Oral Instructions of the Great Elixir by the Primordial True Man Wei Boyang**\n\nThe dragon is mercury, the tiger is silver.\nMercury, within cinnabar, assumes blackness; silver, within lead, assumes blackness. These two blacks each receive the primordial blackness of Heaven and Earth.\n\nDiscourse: The nature of metal is cold; it is produced in the waters of the southern direction—mercury born from cinnabar is an example. Thus, it is said to be the position of yang containing yin.\nThe nature of stone is hot; it is produced within the black base of the northern direction—silver born from lead is an example. Thus, it is said to be the position of yin containing yang.\n\nDiscourse: The ruler of the five metals resides within the *Kan* trigram of the northern direction, where the mysterious conceals the yellow sprout.\nIt is also said: The child hides in the mother’s womb; the mother conceals the child’s embryo. Knowing the white, guarding the black, the numinous brightness comes of itself.\nMercury emerges from cinnabar, departing the mother’s womb of the southern direction, returning to the *Zhen* trigram of the eastern direction—*jia* and *yi* wood—to become the dragon.\nSilver emerges from lead, departing the mother’s womb of the northern direction, returning to the *Dui* trigram of the western direction—*geng* and *xin* metal—to be called the white tiger.\nReversing cinnabar into mercury, reversing silver into gold—this is called the female and male.\nSong:\nThe dragon calls to the tiger,\nThe tiger inhales its essence.\nThe two consume each other,\nMeeting metal, they merge as one.\nThus, the record states: This is the Elixir of Dragon and Tiger.\nIt is necessary to reverse cinnabar into mercury, to reverse silver into gold.\nThus it is said: Lead is not lead, but mercury.\nThe Yellow Emperor saw its color like the bloom of gold, hence calling it *Beautiful Metal Bloom*.\nThe King of Huai refined *autumn stone*: the eighth month is the proper position of metal, its color greenish-white, thus called *autumn stone*.\nSeeing its color yellow-white, like the first sprout of the myriad things, it is called *yellow sprout*.\nFour names differ, yet their origin is one and the same.\nSong:\nRefining silver from lead,\nThe divine work is natural.\nIn the ash pool, flames blaze,\nLead sinks, silver floats—\nThis is called *yellow sprout*.\nThe sprout’s nature is slightly warm, its flavor especially sweet. Though it is the supreme medicine for longevity, as a solitary yang it is the sprout and cannot be taken in excess.\nIt must be combined with mercury to become the female-male *yellow sprout*.\nSong:\nUse lead yet not lead,\nReturn to act within lead.\nThe five metals strictly avoid lead and tin; they must not be mistakenly used.\n\nMaster Hu Gangzi asked Wei Boyang: “Since lead and tin are strictly avoided, what substance should be used for the crucible to refine them?”\nBoyang replied: “The crucible—there is fundamentally no crucible; the medicine—there is fundamentally no medicine.\nThe *yellow sprout* is not lead,\nYet it is not apart from acting within lead.”\nHu Gangzi said: “If there is no crucible or medicine, and it is not lead, then what is refined to be called *yellow sprout*?”\nThe Venerable Wei said:\nTo plant grain, one must use millet;\nTo hatch a chicken, one must use its egg.\nSwallows do not give birth to phoenixes,\nFoxes and hares do not nurse horses.\nDifferent kinds do not share the same species,\nHow can they dwell together as one?\nTo refine gold, one must obtain gold;\nTo refine silver, one must obtain silver.\nThings transform through mutual dependence,\nThe false and true naturally require each other.\nDo not fear the medicine is not sacred,\nOnly fear the medicine is not true.\nIf one understands the true and correct,\nComprehends the principles and meanings,\nWhat worry is there that the medicine will not form?”\n\nThe scripture says: The myriad things flourish,\nEach returning to its root.\nGold is born from earth,\nThe gate of the supremely subtle.\n**Oral Instructions on the Weight of Ingredients**\nTake eight ounces of *yellow sprout*, belonging to *Qian* (the Creative), hardness, yang, the tiger.\nTake eight ounces of mercury, belonging to *Kun* (the Receptive), softness, yin, the dragon.\nThus it is said: *Qian* hardness, *Kun* softness, yin and yang, dragon and tiger.\nEach ounce has four great parts; one catty has sixty-four parts. Each part has six *zhu*, corresponding to the number of lines in the hexagrams.\nWater is one, fire is two, weight is three, medicine is four, earth is five—corresponding to the numbers of the Five Phases.\nBegin firing from the *Fu* hexagram, to *Lin*, to *Tai*, to *Dazhuang*, to *Guai*, to *Qian*—this is the extreme of yang.\nTo *Gou*, to *Dun*, to *Pi*, to *Guan*, to *Bo*, to the end of *Kun*—this is the extreme of yin.\nCounting twelve hexagrams, corresponding to the seasons of one year.\nThe medicine in the crucible is like the child in the womb; above is water, below is fire, following the order of yin and yang.\nWater’s blackness descends, fire’s blackness ascends; the two blacks intermingle in harmony. Cold and heat do not err, and transformation occurs naturally.\nThough sages and worthies may be present, they cannot fathom the changes within the furnace.\nThe twelve hexagrams, the firing process complete, the twenty-four blacks circulate fully.\nFire’s flavor is bitter, wood’s flavor is sour, water’s flavor is salty, metal’s flavor is acrid, earth’s flavor is sweet.\nFrom the southern direction, circling the heavens, returning to the center.\nThe flavors of *wu* and *ji* (earth) are called *Returning Elixir*. *Dan* (elixir) means red.\nThe name *Returning Elixir* means returning to its original essence, hence called *Returning Elixir*.\n\n**Oral Instructions on the Firing Process**\nFirst month: half a catty, ten days.\nSecond month: one catty, increasing to twenty days.\nThird month: one and a half catties, to thirty days.\nFourth month: two catties, increasing to forty days.\nFifth month: two and a half catties, increasing to the extreme of fifty days.\nSixth month: two catties, yin born, sixty days.\nSeventh month: one and a half catties, seventy days.\nEighth month: one catty, eighty days.\nNinth month: half a catty, ninety days.\nTenth month: one hundred days of cold stabilization—then open the crucible to avoid losing essence.\nBegin at *yin*, prosper at *wu*, rest in *xu*.\nIf observing the dawn, it is completed in one hundred days.\nIt is also said: One day has twelve hours; ninety days total one thousand eighty hours, corresponding to three full cycles.\n\n**Oral Instructions on the Crucible and Ingredients for the Posterior Use of True Lead and True Mercury**\nWhat crucible should be used for the crucible?\nOne must use the *earth dragon child*.\nThe true instructions do not permit using iron or porcelain as the crucible; one must use a *wu*-earth vessel.\nThe so-called *earth dragon child* is the yellow-earth crucible.\nLike husband and wife in the bedchamber,\nNaturally cherishing each other,\nOverflowing and dying of themselves.\n\nThe *Father-Mother Womb Crucible* also takes the image of the Central Palace.\nThe medicinal ingredients—yin and yang essences—both return to *wu-ji* earth.\nThe essence of yin and yang is true mercury.\nTrue lead is born within black lead, true mercury produced within cinnabar.\nMoreover, these two substances transform through Heaven and Earth,\nDrawing and circulating the qi of movement—\nThis is the essence of sun and moon,\nAlso called *Dragon and Tiger*,\nAlso called *Kan and Li*,\nAlso called yin and yang,\nAlso called husband and wife.\n*Wu-ji* earth is the mother of the Five Phases;\nThrough the mother’s nurturing embrace, the Great Medicine is formed.\nWhen ingested by humans, it grants longevity;\nThe five metals, earth, wood, tiles, and stones—\nAll are transmuted into treasure.\n*Wu-ji* does not act alone but arises from yellow lead.\n*Wu-ji* is the child of the earth dragon,\nYellow lead is the *Yellow Sprout*,\nIts outer hue faintly yellow—\nHence the name *Yellow Sprout*, also called *Yellow Silver*.\nIts powers are unfathomable,\nUndergoing a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes,\nAble to subdue cinnabar mercury,\nAble to deaden the Eight Stones and the five metals—\nIt is the ancestor of the Great Elixir.\nThe *Supreme Unity Yin* is the son of the yin household,\nThe *Li Nine Yang* is the daughter of the yang household.\n*Supreme Unity Yin* is the name of the moon,\n*Li Nine Yang* is the name of the sun.\nThese two substances are the essence of sun and moon;\nWhen the method of their union is obtained,\nThey are matched as husband and wife.\nTheir appearances perfectly correspond,\nYet they cannot unite on their own.\nBoth substances are white—\nThus it is said their appearances perfectly correspond.\nThey cannot unite on their own because the two substances do not naturally meet,\nOne in the east, one in the west.\nThey must be matched,\nBrought together for a moment,\nFire and qi set in motion,\nPlaced within the earth crucible—\nThen their affections grow intimate,\nAnd the Supreme Medicine forms of itself.\nThe firing times need not be many,\nOnly as when a hen broods her eggs.\nUse fire to warm and nurture,\nAlways as when a hen sits upon her eggs—\nToo much will harm the qi and cause leakage.\nThe *Yellow Sprout* serves as a felt blanket,\nThick and warm, preventing light escape.\nMercury’s nature is inherently volatile and restless,\nBut when subdued by the *Yellow Sprout*,\nWarmed by fire and nurtured,\nIt cannot flee—\nNaturally, the Supreme Medicine forms and dies of itself.\nThe sage grasps the celestial mechanism,\nMerely by recognizing the true Dragon and Tiger.\nThe sage penetrates the celestial mechanism,\nHis marvel lies in knowing the true Dragon.\nThe true Tiger, when warmed and nurtured, becomes the Elixir.\nIt saves the dying and prolongs life,\nRescues the orphaned and aids the imperiled.\nWhen appearance has withered and aged,\nIt is reformed and moved to another vessel.\nThe *Yellow Sprout* subdues mercury,\nMercury gradually ages and dies,\nThen is transferred and nurtured in a separate crucible—\nThus it is called *reforming and moving to another vessel*.\nIt is further transmitted as spirit,\nEach phase restraining and subduing the next.\nTherefore it is said: *reforming and moving to another vessel*.\nIf the three do not enter,\nMother and child return to the same place.\nWhen mercury sees the *Yellow Sprout* die,\nIt will not enter the *Yellow Sprout*.\nTransferred and nurtured separately,\nMother and child feign death together.\nMercury is the mother,\nAnd the *Yellow Sprout* is temporarily placed with it—\nEntering watery silver, it is consumed and dies,\nThus it is said: *mother and child return to the same place*.\n\nAn ancient song says:\nThe King of Huainan refined *Autumn Stone*,\nThe Yellow Emperor praised *Golden Flower*.\n*Autumn Stone* is true lead,\n*Golden Flower* lead is the *Yellow Sprout*—\nThese are not common lead,\nBut the essence drawn from within lead.\nMother and child dwell in one place,\nAs if in the home of immortals.\nAll the children grow to maturity,\nTheir complexions radiant and lustrous.\nThe mother, the *Yellow Sprout*, subdues mercury,\nAnd the Supreme Medicine is formed—\nTheir hues grow ever more vivid,\nCalled *all the children grown to maturity, their complexions bright and lustrous*.\n\nThe *Supreme Unity Song* says:\nWhen cloudy things resemble the *Yellow Sprout*,\nRed chrysanthemums bear purple blossoms.\nIngesting it grants longevity and flight through clouds and mist,\nUsing it as wealth and treasure enriches your household.\nWash and refine with the *Flowery Pond*,\nRemoving impurities and dispelling vexation.\nWhen the Supreme Medicine is formed,\nIt is further nurtured with the mercury mother—luminous cinnabar—\nThen watery silver is added,\nFlying above the cinnabar—\nThis is called *washing and refining with the Flowery Pond to remove impurities*.\nThis is the nourishment of the Five Phases in inverted sequence.\nWhen the numbers of yin and yang are complete,\nThey unite in a single body to form *Golden Sand*.\nWhen the Supreme Medicine ripens,\nIt is called *Golden Sand*.\nThen it is transferred into the *Ninefold Yellow*,\nSuddenly becoming the *River Chariot*.\nThe medicine ripens and is transferred into a golden vessel,\nNurtured for sixty days—\nThree taels become the *Purple Radiance River Chariot*,\nAble to transmute earth, wood, tiles, stones, lead, tin, copper, and iron,\nAll into *Purple Polishing Gold*.\nThe firing times are as before:\nMetal governs four, earth governs five—\nWithin, the golden vessel is used; without, the earth crucible—\nThus it is called the *Ninefold Yellow*.\nIf you encounter this true formula,\nYour karmic fortune is boundless.\nTo encounter this true formula,\nOne must have been destined for the immortal register in a past life.\nDo not recklessly transmit it to the unworthy,\nLest calamities arise like hemp.\nIf transmitted indiscriminately,\nThe Three Officials will punish you.\nHere ends the *Record of the Great Elixir*.",

the yang household.\n*Supreme Unity Yin* is the name of the moon,\n*Li Nine Yang* is the name of the sun.\nThese two substances are the essence of sun and moon;\nWhen the method of their union is obtained,\nThey are matched as husband and wife.\nTheir appearances perfectly correspond,\nYet they cannot unite on their own.\nBoth substances are white—\nThus it is said their appearances perfectly correspond.\nThey cannot unite on their own because the two substances do not naturally meet,\nOne in the east, one in the west.\nThey must be matched,\nBrought together for a moment,\nFire and qi set in motion,\nPlaced within the earth crucible—\nThen their affections grow intimate,\nAnd the Supreme Medicine forms of itself.\nThe firing times need not be many,\nOnly as when a hen broods her eggs.\nUse fire to warm and nurture,\nAlways as when a hen sits upon her eggs—\nToo much will harm the qi and cause leakage.\nThe *Yellow Sprout* serves as a felt blanket,\nThick and warm, preventing light escape.\nMercury’s nature is inherently volatile and restless,\nBut when subdued by the *Yellow Sprout*,\nWarmed by fire and nurtured,\nIt cannot flee—\nNaturally, the Supreme Medicine forms and dies of itself.\nThe sage grasps the celestial mechanism,\nMerely by recognizing the true Dragon and Tiger.\nThe sage penetrates the celestial mechanism,\nHis marvel lies in knowing the true Dragon.\nThe true Tiger, when warmed and nurtured, becomes the Elixir.\nIt saves the dying and prolongs life,\nRescues the orphaned and aids the imperiled.\nWhen appearance has withered and aged,\nIt is reformed and moved to another vessel.\nThe *Yellow Sprout* subdues mercury,\nMercury gradually ages and dies,\nThen is transferred and nurtured in a separate crucible—\nThus it is called *reforming and moving to another vessel*.\nIt is further transmitted as spirit,\nEach phase restraining and subduing the next.\nTherefore it is said: *reforming and moving to another vessel*.\nIf the three do not enter,\nMother and child return to the same place.\nWhen mercury sees the *Yellow Sprout* die,\nIt will not enter the *Yellow Sprout*.\nTransferred and nurtured separately,\nMother and child feign death together.\nMercury is the mother,\nAnd the *Yellow Sprout* is temporarily placed with it—\nEntering watery silver, it is consumed and dies,\nThus it is said: *mother and child return to the same place*.\n\nAn ancient song says:\nThe King of Huainan refined *Autumn Stone*,\nThe Yellow Emperor praised *Golden Flower*.\n*Autumn Stone* is true lead,\n*Golden Flower* lead is the *Yellow Sprout*—\nThese are not common lead,\nBut the essence drawn from within lead.\nMother and child dwell in one place,\nAs if in the home of immortals.\nAll the children grow to maturity,\nTheir complexions radiant and lustrous.\nThe mother, the *Yellow Sprout*, subdues mercury,\nAnd the Supreme Medicine is formed—\nTheir hues grow ever more vivid,\nCalled *all the children grown to maturity, their complexions bright and lustrous*.\n\nThe *Supreme Unity Song* says:\nWhen cloudy things resemble the *Yellow Sprout*,\nRed chrysanthemums bear purple blossoms.\nIngesting it grants longevity and flight through clouds and mist,\nUsing it as wealth and treasure enriches your household.\nWash and refine with the *Flowery Pond*,\nRemoving impurities and dispelling vexation.\nWhen the Supreme Medicine is formed,\nIt is further nurtured with the mercury mother—luminous cinnabar—\nThen watery silver is added,\nFlying above the cinnabar—\nThis is called *washing and refining with the Flowery Pond to remove impurities*.\nThis is the nourishment of the Five Phases in inverted sequence.\nWhen the numbers of yin and yang are complete,\nThey unite in a single body to form *Golden Sand*.\nWhen the Supreme Medicine ripens,\nIt is called *Golden Sand*.\nThen it is transferred into the *Ninefold Yellow*,\nSuddenly becoming the *River Chariot*.\nThe medicine ripens and is transferred into a golden vessel,\nNurtured for sixty days—\nThree taels become the *Purple Radiance River Chariot*,\nAble to transmute earth, wood, tiles, stones, lead, tin, copper, and iron,\nAll into *Purple Polishing Gold*.\nThe firing times are as before:\nMetal governs four, earth governs five—\nWithin, the golden vessel is used; without, the earth crucible—\nThus it is called the *Ninefold Yellow*.\nIf you encounter this true formula,\nYour karmic fortune is boundless.\nTo encounter this true formula,\nOne must have been destined for the immortal register in a past life.\nDo not recklessly transmit it to the unworthy,\nLest calamities arise like hemp.\nIf transmitted indiscriminately,\nThe Three Officials will punish you.\nHere ends the *Record of the Great Elixir*.",
