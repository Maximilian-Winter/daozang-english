  "full_translation": "*The Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection*\n**Title:** *The Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection*. Sixty scrolls, unattributed, likely composed during the Yuan dynasty. Base text from *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Scroll Nine of *The Great Compendium of the Golden Elixir in the Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection***\n*Recorded by Zixu Liaozhenzi Xiao Tingzhi Yuanrui*\n\n### *Exposition on the Primordial Ultimate Diagram*\nThat which is called the Dao/Way. What is above form is termed the Dao—this is the essence of the Dao. From the Primordial Ultimate (元极) emerges the Supreme Ultimate (太极). Setting aside the three within the ninefold wood number, it encompasses fifty-five numbers. The central ○ is its fundamental essence.\n\nWhen the Supreme Ultimate divides, the Two Modes (两仪) are born. Movement arises from yin; stillness is rooted in yang. Through the transformation of yang and the union of yin, water, fire, earth, metal, and wood are generated.\n\nWater: generative number one, completion number six.\nFire: generative number two, completion number seven.\nWood: generative number three, completion number eight.\nMetal: generative number four, completion number nine.\nEarth: generative number five, completion number ten.\nThese are the generative and completion numbers of the Five Phases.\n\nHeaven-one, Earth-two; Heaven-three, Earth-four; Heaven-five, Earth-six; Heaven-seven, Earth-eight; Heaven-nine, Earth-ten. The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five. These are the odd (yang) and even (yin) numbers.\n\nThat which is called the Dao is the interplay of one yin and one yang; the ceaseless generation of life is called the *Yi* (易). One is the odd number; two is the even number. Yang as odd and yin as even—from two arises three.\n\nPure *Qian* (乾) is nature; the union of two *Qian* forms *Kun* (坤), which is destiny. This is akin to essence and qi. *Qian* repeatedly seeks *Kun* to form *Kan* (坎), wherein the yang within *Kan* is primordial qi—this is what is meant by \"the Dao of *Qian* gives rise to the male.\" *Kun* repeatedly seeks *Qian* to form *Li* (离), wherein the yin within *Li* is true essence—this is what is meant by \"the Dao of *Kun* gives rise to the female.\" *Qian* as male and *Kun* as female refer to transformation through qi.\n\n*Li* symbolizes the sun; *Kan* symbolizes the moon. The union of sun and moon forms the *Wu* (吴). The *Yi* is the Dao of daily practice and simplicity, ever-changing yet never perishing.\n\nThus, the essence within form remains quiescent and unmoving, for what is firm, strong, centered, upright, pure, and refined abides—this is where nature resides and the root of destiny lies. The spirit within the heart responds and connects, for joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure, love, aversion, and desire abide—this is where destiny resides and the pivot of nature lies.\n\nRestraining anger causes the heart-fire to descend; suppressing desire causes the kidney-water to ascend. The noble person, centered in the yellow and penetrating principle, occupies the correct position within the body. Virtue/power resides within, flowing through the four limbs—thus cultivation brings auspiciousness.\n\nThereafter, guarding against deviance and preserving sincerity, one remains foolish all day. When the heavenly principle is wholly preserved, returning to the root is called tranquility; tranquility is called restoration. Movement reaches its extreme and reverts to stillness; stillness reaches its extreme and reverts to movement.\n\nThe myriad things transform—this refers to transformation through form. What is below form is termed \"instrument\"—this is the function of the Dao.\n\nMaster Nanxuan said: Truly recognizing the root is called \"knowing the Dao.\" One who knows this Dao may transcend the bounds of creation and stand alone, towering and self-sustaining.\n\n### *Diagram of the Celestial Heart*\nThe hook lies horizontal like a crescent moon; three points form the platform of stars. The Dipper’s handle revolves; the tiger roars and the dragon intones.\n\n### *Diagram of the Mysterious Female*\nThe valley of emptiness and primal origin, the root of Heaven and Earth. Mysterious and yet more mysterious—this is the gate of all wonders.\n\n### *Diagram of the Accomplished Cauldron*\nLead-water arises from *Li*; mercury-fire roots in *Kan*. They enter the cauldron of mutual support, achieving interpenetration.\n\n### *Diagram of the River Chariot*\nThe true north is perfectly black; sun and moon serve as its wheels. It transports water and circulates fire, ceaseless day and night.\n\n### *Diagram of the Circumambulation of Heaven’s Fire Timing*\n*Diagram of the Fire Timing Talisman for Discharging Heaven’s Fire*\n\n**The Eleven Months and the Return of the *Fu* Hexagram**\nThe eleventh month corresponds to the *Fu* hexagram, called the \"First Return.\" A faint, gentle fire is suitable for nurturing; the initial yang (nine at the bottom) is a \"hidden dragon\" that must not be forced.\n\n**The Twelfth Month and the *Lin* Hexagram**\nThe twelfth month corresponds to the *Lin* hexagram, called the \"Second Return.\" One must await the time when the second yang (nine in the second place) appears as a dragon—only then do yin and yang begin to cherish one another.\n\n**The First Month and the *Tai* Hexagram**\nThe first month corresponds to the *Tai* hexagram, called the \"Third Return and First Reversal.\" In the *yin* month, the *zhun* line straightens the matter; only then may one begin to advance the fire and refine the red lead.\n\n**The Second Month and the *Zhuang* Hexagram**\nWood-fluid flourishes in the *mao* month; the cinnabar elixir should be bathed.\n\n**The Third Month and the *Da Zhuang* Hexagram**\nThe third month corresponds to the *Da Zhuang* hexagram, called the \"Fourth Return and Second Reversal.\" Within this reversal, one must discern the subtleties of the work—after the civil fire, one should add a martial fire.\n\n**The Fourth Month and the *Qian* Hexagram**\nThe fourth month corresponds to the *Qian* hexagram, called the \"Fifth Return and Third Reversal.\" In this month, one must again apply the martial fire, drawing forth the White Tiger to produce the luminous pearl.\n\n**The Fifth Month and the *Gou* Hexagram**\nThe fifth month corresponds to the *Gou* hexagram, called the \"Sixth Return and Fourth Reversal.\" After bathing, retreat the talisman; the processes of withdrawal and addition remain perilous.\n\n**The Sixth Month and the *Qian* Hexagram**\nThe sixth month corresponds to the *Qian* hexagram, called the \"Seventh Return and Fifth Reversal.\" As the martial fire nears its end, employ a civil fire; the peach blossoms have fallen, leaving only the stem.\n\n**The Seventh Month and the *Pi* Hexagram**\nThe seventh month corresponds to the *Pi* hexagram, called the \"Eighth Return and Sixth Reversal.\" Civil fire at both ends, martial fire in the middle.\n\n**The Eighth Month and the *Guan* Hexagram**\nMetal-essence flourishes in the *you* month; after bathing, nurture the fire.\n\n**The Ninth Month and the *Bo* Hexagram**\nThe ninth month corresponds to the *Bo* hexagram, called the \"Ninth Return and Seventh Reversal.\" Receiving the generative and transformative powers, the fire’s abode lies in the *xu* month.\n\n**The Tenth Month and the *Kun* Hexagram**\nThe embryo is swallowed into the abdomen; \"my fate is not left to Heaven.\" The work enters the *Kun* palace, and the Way of the Returned Elixir is complete.\n\n### *Diagram of the Sixty Hexagrams’ Great Timing*\nSome ask: \"There are sixty-four hexagrams; why are only sixty used?\"\n*Qian* and *Kun* serve as the gate and vessel;\n*Kan* and *Li* form the framework and pivot.\nThey embody Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, encompassing the myriad things—unused yet employed to achieve penetration.\n\nThe sixty hexagrams comprise three hundred sixty lines, and together with the four hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*, total three hundred eighty-four lines, amounting to eleven thousand five hundred twenty counting rods, corresponding to the number of the myriad things.\nMorning and evening each employ one hexagram, totaling twelve lines, with each line representing one hour.\nIn its smallness, it mirrors the three hundred sixty hours of a month;\nin its grandeur, it mirrors the three hundred sixty days of a year;\nin its movement, it mirrors the degrees of the celestial revolution.\nWhen one grasps the image and forgets the words, the meaning becomes clear.\n\n### *Diagram of the Great Expansion Number*\nTwo from the south of Winter Mountain, five from the north, and four from the west combine.\n*Wu* and *Ji* return to their original generative numbers; the three families meet to form the infant.\n\nHeaven and Earth possess no useless numbers. Thus, one, three, five, seven, nine are the odd yang numbers, totaling twenty-five as Heaven’s number. Two, four, six, eight, ten are the even yin numbers, totaling thirty as Earth’s number. The numbers of Heaven and Earth together total fifty-five. The number of the Great Expansion is fifty, subtracting five as the root of the Five Phases. Its use is forty-nine, further subtracting one to symbolize the unmoving Great Ultimate. From this, one may understand its substance and function.\n\nThe *Zhongli Transmission of the Dao* states: \"Advancing the fire has its numbers.\"\n\n### *Diagram of the Golden Elixir’s Key*\n**Song of the Discarded Key**\nThe key of *Qian* and *Kun* is struck by number;\nthe *Li* and *Kan* spoon is probed by timing.\nLead-dragon ascends as mercury-tiger descends;\ntortoise and snake hold fast above and below.\nThe sun above turns beneath the earth;\nthe moon beneath the sea flies above the heavens.\n*Qian* and *Kun*, sun and moon, do not move of themselves—\nall is due to the Dipper’s handle turning the mechanism.\nIf the human heart aligns with the Heavenly Heart,\nyin and yang are inverted in but a moment.\nWhen tiger and dragon have battled and the Three Fields are still,\ngather the mysterious pearl and plant it in the mud.\nThe Yellow Dame mediates, entering the Central Palace;\ninfant and maiden pursue one another.\nUsing years for months, days for hours,\nthe work within the moment grows ever more wondrous.\nSecretly trysting with the Dipper and Ox, they rejoice—\nthe Heavenly mechanism is profound, few know it.\nAdvancing the fire refines the marrow of Heaven and Earth;\nopening the furnace and bathing, rosy clouds advance in splendor.\nNine Returns and Seven Reversals occur in an instant;\ntrue blackness steams and reaches the four limbs.\nNurturing the infant relies solely on the mother;\nguarding the city and waging wild war require vigilance.\nOne hour and eight quarters make a celestial cycle;\ntwelve hours correspond to one year.\nBeginning with the *Fu* hexagram and ending with *Bo*,\nmorning *Zhun* and evening *Meng* follow in order.\nSpring, summer, autumn, winter proceed in sequence;\nrefining concludes in the *Kun* palace, where it solidifies.\nNo need to exhaust the *Yi* or practice hexagram qi—\nwithin the body, there is naturally a *Kun* and *Qian*.\nWhen Heaven and Earth, sun and moon conjoin,\nshatter the void with but a single fist.\nThe cosmos and its transformations lie in my hands—\nthe supreme Heavenly mechanism is not rashly transmitted.\nOnly humans, most noble and precious,\ncan refine the Golden Fluid and the Great Returned Elixir.\n\n**White Instructions on the Returned Elixir**\nThe Golden Fluid returns and reverses, coalescing into the Great Elixir.\nThe Dao is near at hand; learning immortality is not difficult.\nGather the great medicine from the jade flask,\nrefine the Golden Fluid’s returned elixir,\nplumb the mysterious pearl from the Red Waters.\nTortoise and snake swallow and regurgitate, circulating the supreme treasure of the west;\ndragon and tiger coil and revolve, emerging from the Purple Palace as sea maidens and clouds arise,\nthe Yellow River churns and the Mud Pill’s waves surge.\nThough *Qian* and *Kun* share a body, *Dui* is called the vessel—\nyet lead and mercury, the two substances, are mutually rooted.\nWhere lies the source of the elixir?\nPreserve the Three Essentials to guard the One Origin.\nThe Golden Fluid coalesces,\nnaturally completing the Nine Returns and circling the Seven Reversals.\nThis elixir—\nelusive and formless, yet darkly numinous and precise—\nfollows the eight hexagrams and unites the four images;\ngathers the Three Flowers and penetrates the Five Phases.\nIts flavor emerges from *geng* and *xin*;\none must steady the will to gather it.\nIts hexagrams belong to *Gen* and *Xun*;\none must know the time of its flourishing.\nAt first, refine the Golden Fluid to achieve union;\nin the end, harmonize the jade nectar to nurture completion.\nThe circulation of sun and moon within the flask\nmust clarify the ancestral body within;\nthe union of husband and wife\nmust recognize the root and stem.\nIn ascent and descent, distinguish ruler and minister;\nin coming and going, still discern host and guest.\n\nSilencing the echoes of the ears, harmonizing the breath of the nose,\ndiscern the tender or mature state of the medicine.\nGrasp the precise measures of advance and retreat,\nembrace the One with single-minded devotion, guarding the white *qi* of the feminine and masculine.\nAt dawn, let the flying mercury seize the hun-soul;\nat dusk, draw the lead to restrain the po-soul.\nPush and pull the talismanic fire,\nrolling and unfurling the yin and yang within the nature;\ninhale and exhale the winds and clouds,\nrefining and smelting the *qi*-fluid within the body.\nGenerally, when one refines the *qi*,\none must harmonize it with the Four Images;\nwhen the *qi* is purely yang,\nit naturally dissolves the host of yin.\nSeize the Green Dragon in the east,\ncapture the White Tiger in the west,\nseek the Dark Warrior in the north,\nand the Red Bird in the south.\nOnly in the Central Palace do they harmonize and dwell together.\nSeal them deep within the earthen crucible.\nThere is movement and stillness,\nthere is *qi* but no form;\nknow fortune and misfortune,\ndiscern the moment from the heart.\nOne can brew the wine of spontaneity,\nslowly tune the zither without melody.\nOnce arranged within the cauldron,\nboil it into white snow;\nstir the discarded key of heaven and earth,\nforge it into true gold.\nAt first, metal and wood are separated—\nwho enables their union?\nMetal and water blend,\nyet remain unrefined.\nOnly when the Golden Well is drawn once,\nthe Water Tiger lies hidden;\nwhen the Golden Lock is sprung,\nthe Fire Dragon meets.\nThus, fill the golden crucible to regulate the flavor and seal it firmly;\ningest the purple-golden paste to congeal the spirit and close the senses.\nCirculate the true *qi* to fill the body,\nentering and exiting the vastness of the primordial spirit.\nFire ascends, water descends—\nskillfully manage the *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams;\nthe spokes of the wheel turn in concert—\nsilently align with the *Pi* and *Tai* hexagrams.\nOne must also know the harmony of medicines.\nFor the enlightened, it is easy;\nyet the firing times, the subtle ebb and flow, are difficult to master.\nTen months of effort abide in the faint, continuous breath;\nthirty thousand years of *qi*-destiny lie in the ceaseless coming and going.\nThus, nurture the treasure of the two elixir fields—\nthis treasure endures forever.\nSeize the pearl from the elixir crucible—\nthis pearl returns again.\nHaving attained this method of transcendence,\nconstantly open the gate of life and death.\nDrive the River Chariot,\ndeparting the sea of the mundane world’s tail-end;\nreturn to the Heavenly Valley,\nascending the Kunlun and Penglai mountains.\nAlas! Though myriad immortal methods are expounded in essays, songs, and poems,\nthe single aperture of the Mysterious Pass governs spirit, *qi*, and vitality.\nAscend the Golden Gate,\npay homage at the Golden Palace,\nreceiving the Emperor’s decree;\nadorn the golden form,\nattain the golden immortal,\nshedding the knot of the sacred embryo.\nThis is the ingestion of the golden-fluid elixir,\nforming the vajra-body,\nwhere nature and life are both perfected—\na mystery not lightly revealed.\n\n---\n\n**Poem on the Golden-Fluid Return Elixir**\n\nConvey the fluid to Kunlun’s peak—\nthe effort is truly not arduous.\nComing and going, knock at the jade grotto,\nreturning to refine the golden elixir.\nIn the west, gather the three medicines;\nin the center, guard the single altar.\nSeize the moment to act—\nafter the Seven Returns, it coalesces into a mass.\nStir the plain of heaven and earth,\ncirculate along the shoals of sun and moon.\nThe Mysterious Pass is but one aperture,\na straight path piercing the heavens’ summit.\n\n---\n\n**Treatise on the Golden-Fluid Return Elixir**\n\nThe Dao employs the heart.\nSome may doubt this—\nthe perfected ones clarify it.\nThe Dao is the essence of the heart;\nthe heart is the function of the Dao.\nThe Dao fuses with the heart,\nthe heart unites with the Dao—\nbeyond the Dao, there is no remaining heart;\nbeyond the heart, there is no remaining Dao.\nThose who know how to apply this:\nobserve the heart through the Dao, and the heart is the Dao;\npermeate the Dao with the heart, and the Dao is the heart.\nThis heart is not the human heart—\nit is the heart of Heaven.\nHeaven resides at the North Star,\nthe pivot of creation—\nthis is the heart.\nThus, when the Dipper’s handle turns once,\nthe four seasons respond in rhythm,\nthe Five Phases follow in order,\ncold and heat strike the mean,\nyin and yang attain harmony.\nIt is the same in humans.\nThe head has five palaces,\ncorresponding to the nine directions—\namong them, one palace is called the Heavenly Heart.\nIt is also named the Purple Palace, Heavenly Abyss, Heavenly Wheel,\nHeavenly Pass, Heavenly Capital Mountain, Capital Pass, Kunlun Peak—\nits names are many.\nIn sum, it is called the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass.\nThose who apply it here need not distinguish the rivers and springs\nwhere medicinal ingredients are produced,\nnor the subtleties of firing times,\nnor even the warming and nurturing to form the elixir—\nall do not depart from the function of this heart.\nIt is often said: the more the medicine is gathered, the more it multiplies;\nthe more the fire refines, the more it coalesces.\nAt the outset of gathering the medicine,\nstir the sacred key of heaven and earth,\ntake the *daogui* from *Li* and *Kan*,\ncongeal the spirit and gather the *qi*,\nharmonize the breath of the nose,\nso that inhalation and exhalation respond to the hand.\nWhen the spirit and *qi* enter their root,\nclosing too tightly leads to urgency,\nloosening too freely leads to dissipation—\nonly let it be faint and continuous,\nwithout interruption.\nThen, the spirit naturally congeals over time,\nthe breath naturally settles over time.\nIn the work of firing,\nthere is hardness and softness,\ncivil and martial,\nadvancing an inch and retreating a foot,\nshort in front and long behind,\ndistinguishing guest and host, establishing ruler and minister,\nso that the yin talismans and yang fire advance and retreat appropriately.\nIf the fire’s measure is too parched, the mercury will fly upward;\nif the water’s weight is too excessive, the lead will dissolve downward—\nonly by balancing the weight and measure,\nadhering to the proper method,\ncan one avoid the error of advancing fire and retreating talismans.\nThus, follow the hexagrams’ lines,\ncompressing twelve months into a single hour,\nwith yin and yang ascending and descending—\nthis is the rule for applying the fire.\nWhen the first yang arises, it begins with *Fu*,\nthe time is *zi*—\ngently nurture the hidden dragon.\n*Lin* is *chou*—\nwarmly nurture the emerging dragon.\n*Tai* is *yin*—\nfire is born in *yin*,\nthe direct task of *Zhun*,\nso advance the talisman with martial fire.\n*Zhuang* is *mao*—\nyang contains yin within,\nso bathe.\n*Guai* is *chen*—\nrefine with civil fire.\n*Qian* ends at *si*—\nadd martial fire.\nFrom *zi* to *si*, pure yang governs—\nthis is seeking outer yang from inner yin.\nWhen the first yin arises, it begins with *Gou*,\nthe time is *wu*—\nfire flourishes at *wu*,\nso retreat the talisman with civil fire.\n\nSlow is *wei*—the time is the sixth month,\nso apply martial fire,\nlest it become the thick frost of midsummer.\n*Pi* is *shen*—\ngently regulate with mild fire.\n*Guan* is *you*—\nyin contains yang within,\nso bathe, then nurture the fire.\n*Bo* is *xu*—\nfire is stored in *xu*,\nreceiving the gift of generation and completion,\nso use martial fire.\n*Kun* ends at *hai*—\nshedding the embryo to enter the womb,\ntransforming to achieve change.\nFrom *wu* to *hai*, pure yin governs—\nthis is outer yang attaching to inner yin.\nYet fire is born in *yin*, flourishes at *wu*, and is stored in *xu*,\nso the subtlety of withdrawal and addition lies in *Zhun* and *Meng*.\n\nAlas! From *Fu* at the beginning to *Kun* at the end,\nall follow the hexagrams’ images.\nAdvance and retreat mirror the succession of spring, summer, autumn, and winter;\nwithdrawal and addition mirror the waxing and waning of sun and moon.\nBefore fire ignites, borrow the *Xun* wind to fan it;\nonce fire burns, rely on *Kun* water to nourish it.\nWhen the fire’s work ceases,\nqi and liquid merge,\nlead and mercury intertwine,\nthe Crone gathers her sleeves,\nthe Infant looks up in obedience—\nabiding in the central palace,\nthey unite as one.\nThe secret of the seven returns and nine refinements ends here.\n\nHad the firing been misapplied,\na hundred strange signs would arise:\nthe Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon would take flight,\nthe Kan Man and Li Woman would flee in haste.\nEven if the Yellow Emperor tended the furnace,\nthe Great One wielded the fire,\nand the Eight Lords refined it,\nthey could not form the elixir.\n\nCan one not be cautious and harmonize it?\nThus the *Elixir Canon* says:\n\"Even with true lead, true fire is still difficult.\"\nHow could this be lightly discussed?\n\nYet the Dao of the Golden Elixir is all based on images—\nusing lead and mercury as its body,\none must know that lead essence and mercury marrow are but metaphors.\nUsing *Li* and *Kan* as names,\none must know that the Kan Man and Li Woman are mere empty terms.\nUsing dragon and tiger as forms,\none must know that Fire Dragon and Water Tiger are not tangible shapes.\nWhat of Yellow Sprouts and White Snow,\nDivine Water and Flowery Pond—\nare these things visible or usable?\n\nIn essence, they are matched and harmonized,\nwithdrawn and added, then put to use.\nThus this elixir is not made from metals, stones, herbs, or wood,\nnor is this firing governed by years, months, days, or hours.\nOne must proceed from the root and the real ground.\n\nRefining form to transform into blackness,\nrefining blackness to transform into spirit—\nthis is nothing more than seizing Heaven and Earth’s single point of true yang.\nIt begins with effort but ends in effortlessness.\n\nSome cling to images to arrange the furnace,\nattach to forms to craft the crucible,\nfixate on firing times,\nand mistake it all for empty nothingness—\nthis is error.\n\nAh! When *Pi* reaches its limit, *Tai* arises;\nwhen movement reaches its limit, stillness comes.\nIn stillness, life is commanded.\nTrue essence returns at dawn,\ntrue breath settles on its own,\nthe Valley Spirit dwells,\nthe Three Corpses perish.\nThe heart holds no heart,\nthoughts hold no thoughts,\nthe body enters formlessness,\nand merges with the Dao.\n\n*The Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection: Great Compendium of the Golden Elixir, Scroll Nine* ends.\n*The Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection: Great Compendium of the Golden Elixir, Scroll Ten* begins.\n\nPurple Void Perfected Master Xiao Tingzhi Yuanrui’s *Questions and Answers on the Golden Elixir*\n\n**Question:** What is meant by \"golden liquid returning elixir\"?\n**Answer:** The \"golden liquid\" is golden water. Gold is the mother of water, and the mother conceals the child in her womb—hence the name \"returning elixir.\" As the earlier worthies said: \"The elixir is the cinnabar field; the liquid is the fluid of the lungs. Returning the lung’s fluid to the cinnabar field is called the golden liquid returning elixir.\"\n\n**Question:** What are lead and mercury?\n**Answer:** They are not ordinary black tin or quicksilver. True Unity Master said: \"Lead is the father and mother of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang.\" The sages gather the root of heaven and earth’s parents as the foundation of the great elixir, and collect the pure essence of yin and yang as its substance—this is no common fabrication. Mercury’s nature loves to fly, but when it meets lead, it congeals, for child and mother yearn for each other.\n\n**Question:** What is fire?\n**Answer:** Fire is the true qi of the great yang, the yang within *Kan*. Purple Clarity Perfected said: \"Raising fire from within *Kan*.\"\n\n**Question:** What is a *hou* (phase)?\n**Answer:** Five days make one *hou*, completing one cycle of the *jiazi*. Each day has twelve hours, and five days—sixty hours—complete one *jiazi*. Purple Yang said: \"A moment’s effort contains a year’s seasonal phases.\" When raising the fire, in an instant it circulates the celestial orbit.\n\n**Question:** How is the fire phase applied?\n**Answer:** In a year, use the months; in a month, use the days; in a day, use the hours; in an hour, use the *ke* (quarters).\n\n**Question:** What is the true unity?\n**Answer:** When one stabilizes one’s own celestial authenticity within the celestial valley, this is the Way of guarding the true unity. The Master of the Golden Grotto said: \"The true unity resides within the northern pole’s great abyss.\"\n\n**Question:** What are movement and stillness?\n**Answer:** Yang governs movement; yin governs stillness. Emerald Void said: \"Seek stillness within movement; within stillness, there is action. Movement and stillness have their works—this is transmitted orally.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the ninefold return?\n**Answer:** Metal generates four, and its completion number is nine. \"Return\" means descending from above. Nine is the number of old yang. Yin Perfected Lord said: \"From *zi* to *shen* is the ninefold return, descending in sequence.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the sevenfold reversal?\n**Answer:** Fire generates two, and its completion number is seven. \"Reversal\" means ascending from below. Seven is the number of young yang. Yin Perfected Lord said: \"From *yin* to *shen* is seven, reversing upward.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the furnace?\n**Answer:** In the superior elixir method, the spirit is the furnace, nature is the medicine, stillness is water, and wisdom is fire. In the middle elixir method, the spirit is the furnace, qi is the medicine, the sun is fire, and the moon is water. In the inferior elixir method, the body is the furnace, qi is the medicine, the heart is fire, and the kidneys are water. There are also the recumbent moon furnace and the jade furnace.\n\n**Question:** What is the crucible?\n**Answer:** As Bao Perfected said: \"The golden crucible lies near the muddy pellet.\" This is the Yellow Emperor’s casting of the nine crucibles.\n\n**Question:** What are the medicine and ingredients?\n**Answer:** These very medicines, when followed in sequence, form a person; when reversed, they form the elixir. The five phases inverted yield the seven treasures of the great earth; the five phases in sequence lead to the fiery pit of the dharma realm. The common people use them daily yet remain unaware. Purple Clarity said: \"Gather the medicines within the unchanging.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the divine water and flowery pond?\n**Answer:** Li Quan said: \"The essence of the returning elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond.\" Purple Yang said: \"When lead enters mercury, it is called divine water; when mercury enters lead, it is called the flowery pond.\" Sea Toad said: \"From of old, divine water flows from the lofty source.\" Purple Clarity said: \"The flowery pond resides within the sea of qi.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the three passes?\n**Answer:** The head is the celestial pass, the feet are the earthly pass, and the hands are the human pass.\n\n**Question:** What are the inner three essentials?\n**Answer:** The first essential is the great abyssal pool. The second is the crimson palace. The third is the earthly gate.\n\n**Question:** What are the outer three essentials?\n**Answer:** The mouth and nose together form three orifices—the gateways through which spirit and qi come and go. When practicing, regulate the breath through the nose, restrain the tongue’s qi, and close the *dui*.\n\n**Question:** What is *dui*?\n**Answer:** True Unity Master said: \"*Dui* is the mouth.\"\n\n**Question:** Where do the infant boy and the old woman reside?\n**Answer:** The infant boy is in the kidneys; the old woman is in the heart.\n\n**Question:** The kidneys belong to water and are yin; the infant boy belongs to yang and fire. The heart is yang, yet the old woman is yin—why do they reside there?\n**Answer:** The kidneys belong to *Kan*, where yin contains yang—this is true yang. The heart belongs to *Li*, where yang contains yin—this is true yin.\n\n**Question:** Where is the muddy pellet palace?\n**Answer:** The head has nine palaces; the central one is called the muddy pellet.\n\n**Question:** What is the golden lord?\n**Answer:** The golden-edged lord is lead. Purple Yang said: \"One must seek and subdue the golden lord.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the yellow matron?\n**Answer:** Yellow is the color of earth, and its position belongs to *Kun*—hence the name. Purple Clarity said: \"When the golden lord falls silent and the old woman dies, the yellow matron, though aged, still carries the embryo.\"\n\n**Question:** What about breathing?\n**Answer:** Exhalation issues from the heart and lungs; inhalation draws in the kidneys and liver. Exhalation connects to the celestial root; inhalation connects to the earthly root. When exhaling, the dragon sings and clouds arise; when inhaling, the tiger roars and winds stir. Breath and clouds congeal into the golden liquid.\n\n**Question:** What are the nectar and jade fluid?\n**Answer:** Both are divine water.\n\n**Question:** What are spirit and qi?\n**Answer:** Spirit is fire, and fire belongs to the heart. Qi is the medicine, and the medicine belongs to the body.\n\nSpirit and qi are mother and child. Master Xu Jing of the Void Clarity said: \"Qi is the origin of life; spirit is the regulator of life. To maintain fullness and govern spirit, concentrate qi and embrace it—spirit abides where qi dwells, and when spirit and qi unite, one may attain longevity.\" The Three Mao Perfected Lords said: \"Qi is the elixir that adds years; the heart commands the spirit of qi. If one knows the master of circulating qi, one becomes an immortal.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the Twelve Towers?\n**Answer:** They are the twelve joints of the human throat.\n\n**Question:** What are the curtain and screen?\n**Answer:** They are the eyes. When practicing inner work, one contains the light within the cloud chamber—this is called \"closing the door and lowering the curtain,\" silently observing within.\n\n**Question:** What is *zi* and *wu*?\n**Answer:** *Zi* and *wu* are the center of Heaven and Earth. In Heaven, they are the sun and moon; in humans, they are the heart and kidneys; in time, they are *zi* and *wu*; in the hexagrams, they are *Kan* and *Li*; in direction, they are north and south.\n\n**Question:** What does it mean that the five positions interact and each has its correspondence?\n**Answer:** The number of Heaven and Earth is fifty-five. Thus, *Qian* takes one, nine combines to make ten; *Kun* takes four, six combines to make ten; *Xun* and *Dui* take two, eight combines to make ten; *Zhen* and *Gen* take three, seven combines to make ten; *Li* takes five, *Kan* takes ten—*Kan* and *Li* have no pair, so they unite themselves. In terms of numbers, this is the central number of Heaven and Earth; in terms of lines, it is the central line of Heaven and Earth; in terms of position, it is the central place of Heaven and Earth. *Kan* and *Li* are the agents—how could their use not be great?\n\n**Question:** What are the Five Peaks?\n**Answer:** The *True Forms of the Five Peaks* states: \"They are in the human head.\" Purple Clarity refers to the line, \"With a kerchief, one conceals the Five Peaks crown.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the Mysterious Female?\n**Answer:** Above is called *xuan* (mysterious); below is called *pin* (female). The Mysterious Pass is a single aperture—on the left it is called *xuan*, on the right *pin*.\n\n**Question:** What is the Gate of the Mysterious Female?\n**Answer:** The nose connects to celestial qi—this is the *xuan* gate. The mouth connects to earthly qi—this is the *pin* door. Nose and mouth are the gates and doors of the Mysterious Female.\n\n**Question:** What are the Three Sons and Three Daughters?\n**Answer:** The Dao of *Qian* seeks *Kun*—the eldest son is *Zhen*, the middle son is *Kan*, the youngest son is *Gen*. The Dao of *Kun* seeks *Qian*—the eldest daughter is *Xun*, the middle daughter is *Li*, the youngest daughter is *Dui*.\n\n**Question:** What are the Fire Dragon and Water Tiger?\n**Answer:** The tiger is the metal of the west. Metal generates water, yet conceals its form within water. The dragon is the wood of the east. Wood generates fire, yet is restrained by fire. The Perfected Lord of Venus said: \"The Five Phases do not proceed in order—the tiger is born within water. When the Five Phases are inverted, the dragon emerges from within fire.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the solstices and equinoxes?\n**Answer:** The *zi* hour corresponds to the winter solstice, when yin reaches its extreme and yang is born; the *wu* hour corresponds to the summer solstice, when yang reaches its extreme and yin is born; the *mao* hour corresponds to the spring equinox, when yang contains yin; the *you* hour corresponds to the autumn equinox, when yin contains yang. The human body also has solstices and equinoxes. Master Purple Yang said: \"Divide the body and heart into the upper and lower arcs; distinguish the winter and summer solstices by spirit and qi.\"\n\n**Question:** What is bathing?\n**Answer:** When true qi steams and divine water irrigates, this is bathing. The Most High said: \"Wash with sweet springs, cleanse away filth and grime. It issues from the Flowery Pond and later returns to the *Kun* door.\" Apricot Grove said: \"Bathing relies on divine water—this is it.\"\n\n**Question:** What is drawing and adding?\n**Answer:** After drawing lead from behind the elbow, one must add mercury to the central yellow. The *Anthology of Transmitted Dao* said: \"When it is time to draw, one must not fail to add.\"\n\n**Question:** What is transporting?\n**Answer:** Transport the golden essence from behind the elbow, move the jade fluid to the Mud Pill Palace—this is the foundational work, and the oral instructions are preserved therein.\n\n**Question:** What are the Three Fields?\n**Answer:** The brain is the Upper Field, the heart is the Middle Field, and the Sea of Qi is the Lower Field. If one obtains the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle to revolve them, then the upper and lower circulate like the flow of the Celestial River.\n\n**Question:** What are the Three Passes behind the back?\n**Answer:** Behind the brain is the Jade Pillow Pass; along the spine is the Narrow Pass; at the junction of water and fire is the Tail Gate Pass.\n\n**Question:** What is the Spirit Chamber?\n**Answer:** It is the chamber where the original spirit resides. Master Langran said: \"Before understanding the Spirit Chamber, a thousand disturbances arise; once the Heart Field is enlightened, ten thousand affairs become idle.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown?\n**Answer:** Spirit, qi, and essence merge into one. The Mysterious Pass is a single aperture—it is the culmination of spirit, qi, and essence.\n\n**Question:** What is the Five Qi Returning to the Origin?\n**Answer:** The true qi of the five viscera ascends to pay homage to the Celestial Origin.\n\n**Question:** What is the Harmonizing and Uniting of the Four Images?\n**Answer:** When the eyes do not see, the hun-soul resides in the liver; when the ears do not hear, the essence resides in the kidneys; when the tongue does not move, the spirit resides in the heart; when the nose does not smell, the po-soul resides in the lungs. Spirit, essence, hun-soul, and po-soul gather in the earth of intent.\n\n**Question:** What are Horse Teeth, True Master, Spirit Talisman, and White Snow?\n**Answer:** All are general names for lead and mercury.\n\n**Question:** What is the River Chariot?\n**Answer:** The correct qi of the north is called the River Chariot. On the left is the Sun Hub, on the right is the Moon Hub. It carries the correct qi, transports and stores the original yang, follows the seasons in its movement—all foundational work relies on the power of this chariot.\n\n**Question:** What are old and tender?\n**Answer:** When gathering the medicine, one must discern its oldness or tenderness. Peng Helin said: \"When tender, gather it; when old, it withers.\" Master Purple Yang said: \"When lead sees *gui* born, gather it swiftly; when gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\"\n\n**Question:** What are floating and sinking?\n**Answer:** Lead floats while silver sinks.\n\n**Question:** What are clear and turbid?\n**Answer:** Yang is clear and yin is turbid. The clear floats above, the turbid sinks below. In cultivating the elixir, one retains the clear and discards the turbid—for the clear belongs to yang and the turbid to yin.\n\n**Question:** What is the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases?\n**Answer:** The *Jinbi Jing* states: \"Metal and Wood overcome each other, Water and Fire restrain each other. When Earth flourishes in Metal’s domain, the Three Agents perish, and the Four Seas press in—only then is great peace achieved. This is all due to the power of Earth, the virtue of the Central Palace.\"\n\n**Question:** What is \"coming and going\"?\n**Answer:** \"From *zi* it goes, to *wu* it comes.\" The fire of the Yang tally advances from *zi* to *chen* and *si*; the tally of Yin retreats from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. Beginning in *fu* and ending in *kun*, all is governed by the trigrams. One wanes as the other waxes, one goes as the other comes—thus transformation is accomplished. As the *Yijing* says: \"Closing the door is called *kun*; opening the door is called *qian*. One closing and one opening is called change; ceaseless coming and going is called penetration.\"\n\n**Question:** What are female and male?\n**Answer:** The female is Yin, the male is Yang. \"One Yin and one Yang is called the Dao; solitary Yin or solitary Yang cannot generate on their own.\" The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Male and female intermingle, seeking their kind.\" The commentary says: \"The male is golden cinnabar; the female is fiery mercury. They mutually require and exhale, gathering by kind to generate and form the divine medicine.\"\n\n**Question:** How does one guard against danger?\n**Answer:** Guard against errors in the fire timing and shun confusion in dreams and waking. Master Cuixu said: \"Essence arises at its appointed time; when the time comes, the spirit knows. Within the hundred divisions of the day, one must never be confused.\"\n\n**Question:** What is union?\n**Answer:** Like a lodestone drawing iron, they connect though separated by barriers.\n\n**Question:** What are \"having\" and \"lacking\"?\n**Answer:** The *Jinbi Jing* says: \"Having and lacking mutually restrain; above dwells the Azure Dragon. The Two Lackings stem from One Having—its numinous transformations are wondrous and hard to fathom.\"\n\n**Question:** What are punishment and virtue?\n**Answer:** Yang is virtue; when virtue emerges, the myriad things live. Yin is punishment; when punishment emerges, the myriad things die. Thus, in the second month, Yang contains Yin, and the elm’s pods fall—this images golden cinnabar following Yin’s movements, falling into the womb, hence called \"returning to the root.\" In the eighth month, Yin contains Yang, and the shepherd’s purse sprouts—this images Metal and Water following Yang’s nurturing fluids within the crucible. Therefore, *mao* and *you* are where punishment and virtue contend, Yin and Yang balance, and the tally fire rests.\n\n**Question:** What are black and white?\n**Answer:** The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Know the white, guard the black, and the numinous brightness will come of itself.\" The white is Metal; the black is Water. Taking the root of Metal and Water as the foundation of the medicine.\n\n**Question:** What are cold and heat?\n**Answer:** Master Zhenyi said: \"Do not rely on the clepsydra’s marks; when wind and rain are unregulated, drought and flood contend. Either the Yang fire exceeds its measure, or the Yin tally loses its rhythm. Deep winter turns to scorching summer; high summer reverses to thick frost. If the fire timing errs, the numinous mercury flees—those who tend the fire must be cautious.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the dark and new moons?\n**Answer:** The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Between the dark and new moons, the tally aligns with the central path—this is when Metal and Water tally unite.\"\n\n**Question:** What is sealing and securing?\n**Answer:** The Perfected of Taibai said: \"Seal the embryo to prevent leakage; transformation occurs in an instant.\" This means that when Water and Fire achieve balance, the divine chamber must be closed tightly to prevent any escape.\n\n**Question:** What is the sacred embryo?\n**Answer:** From formlessness arises form, coalescing into the sacred embryo. Guard and nurture it diligently—ten months like tending an infant. When a woman first conceives, it resembles a young dragon just beginning to nurture its pearl. For the spirit and qi have only just congealed, and carelessness can easily lead to loss.\n\n**Question:** What are the Four Cardinal Points?\n**Answer:** *Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* are the Four Cardinal Points. The Mysterious Pass is the single aperture, the palace of the Four Cardinals.\n\n**Question:** Where is the Yellow Court located?\n**Answer:** Above the bladder, below the spleen, before the kidneys, to the left of the liver, and to the right of the lungs.\n\n**Question:** What are the Golden Crow and Jade Hare?\n**Answer:** The crow in the sun corresponds to the fluid in the heart; the hare in the moon corresponds to the qi in the kidneys.\n\n**Question:** What is refining the form?\n**Answer:** Refine the form to transform qi, refine qi to transform spirit, refine spirit to merge with the Dao. The Master of the Golden Grotto said: \"Refining the form with essence is no ordinary cinnabar or stone.\"\n\n**Question:** Master Ziyang said the heart and kidneys are not *kan* and *li*—why?\n**Answer:** The heart and kidneys are merely the substance of *kan* and *li*; they have both substance and function.\n\n**Question:** What is their function?\n**Answer:** The Heavenly Heart is the function of the heart, belonging to *li*. The form is the function of the kidneys, belonging to *kan*. At the moment of union, these are what one employs.\n\n**Question:** What is the work?\n**Answer:** Knowing the time to unite, advancing the fire while guarding against danger, engaging in \"wild battle\" when Yang arises, bathing with punishment and virtue—all to warmly nurture and complete the elixir.\n\n**Question:** What is \"wild battle\"?\n**Answer:** The *Longhu Jing* says: \"Civil means embrace gentleness; martial means suppress rebellion.\" Master Ziyang said: \"Defending the city and waging wild battle reveal fortune and misfortune—only then does the numinous cinnabar fill the crucible red.\"\n\n**Question:** What is warm nurturing?\n**Answer:** Master Xinglin said: \"Warm nurturing resembles the cycle of the stars.\" Master Piling said: \"Keep the golden crucible always warm with broth; do not let the jade furnace grow cold with fire.\"\n\n**Question:** What is refining and smelting?\n**Answer:** Refining the golden crucible, smelting the jade furnace—here lies the oral transmission.\n\n**Question:** What are reward and punishment?\n**Answer:** The arising of spring’s qi is called reward—this is the Yang fire’s time before *si*. The killing of autumn’s qi is called punishment—this is the Yin tally’s time after *wu*.\n\n**Question:** What is defending the city?\n**Answer:** Embracing the origin and guarding the One, congealing spirit and gathering qi.\n\n**Question:** What are dikes and defenses?\n**Answer:** Driving out stray thoughts to focus the mind single-mindedly.\n\n**Question:** What is the \"divine hut\"?\n**Answer:** The nose, the gate through which spirit and qi enter and exit. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"Within the divine hut, cultivation must be pursued; breath enters the hut to reach the cinnabar field.\"\n\n**Question:** What is \"Taiyi containing the true\"?\n**Answer:** Guarding the true One in the Heavenly Valley, qi enters the Mysterious Origin—thus one attains the original Heavenly True.\n\n**Answer to the above:** \"The true Dao nurtures the spirit—if one can guard it, I reside at the gate of dead qi, and the withered bones of seven ancestors all gain life-breath.\"\n\nWhat gives me life is the Dao; what animates me is spirit. To guide spirit in guarding the Dao and nurture spirit with the Dao—this is the way.\n\n**Question:** What are the Three Worms?\n**Answer:** The *Zhonghuang Jing* states: The first is the upper worm, dwelling in the brain. The second is the middle worm, dwelling in the Hall of Light. The third is the lower worm, dwelling in the stomach and intestines. Their names are Peng Shan, Peng Zhi, and Peng Jiao. They despise one’s progress in the Dao and delight in one’s retreat from resolve. The Upper Field is the palace where the original spirit resides, yet people cannot open this gate. When the corpse-worms occupy it, the cycle of birth and death continues without end. If one can grasp the original spirit and settle it in its true palace, the corpse-worms will naturally perish, and the true breath will stabilize of itself. This is what is meant by \"when one aperture opens, all apertures open together; when the great gate is unblocked, all the bones become free\"—then the Heavenly True descends with its numinous power, and the spirit that is not spirit is thus made spirit.\n\n**Question:** What is \"embryonic breathing\"?\n**Answer:** If one can guard the true One, the breath comes and goes as if within the mother’s womb—this is called the Great Stabilization.\n\n**Question:** What is the \"Jade Pool within Kun\"?\n**Answer:** The mouth. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"The Jade Pool’s clear water irrigates the numinous root.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the \"bellows and key\"?\n**Answer:** The *chong* is the bellows bag, and the *yue* is the three-holed flute. It is also the device blacksmiths use to blow air. Laozi said: \"Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows and key?\" The *Shengjiang Lun* states: \"If one can emulate the function of Heaven and Earth’s bellows and key—opening, qi issues forth; closing, qi enters—issuing forth like the Earth’s qi ascending, entering like Heaven’s qi descending. With each ascent and descent, one may attain the same longevity as Heaven and Earth.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the \"Five Sprouts\"?\n**Answer:** They are the true qi of the five viscera. The *Zhonghuang Jing* says: \"If you can guard them, the Three Worms will depart, and you will behold the Five Sprouts and the Nine True Qi.\"\n\n**Question:** What are \"Zhun and Meng\"?\n**Answer:** The *Dao Shu* states: *Kan* is water. Its first transformation is the Water Marsh’s *Jie*; its second is the Water Thunder’s *Zhun*, with its line residing in *yin*. *Li* is fire. Its first transformation is the Fire Mountain’s *Lü*; its second is the Fire Wind’s *Ding*; its third is the Mountain Water’s *Meng*, with its line residing in *xu*. The regulation of water and fire lies in *yin* and *xu*, and the twelve hexagrams’ qi operate through *Zhun* and *Meng*.\n\n**Question:** What does it mean to \"gather the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon\"?\n**Answer:** It does not refer to the external sun and moon but to gathering the true fluid within the heart and the true qi within the kidneys.\n\n**Question:** What are the \"inner and outer Eight Trigrams\"?\n**Answer:** The head is *Qian*, the feet are *Kun*, the bladder is *Gen*, the gall is *Xun*, the kidneys are *Kan*, the heart is *Li*, the liver is *Zhen*, and the lungs are *Dui*.\n\n**Question:** What does it mean to \"await the proper time before beginning cultivation\"?\n**Answer:** There is the work of the hour and the work of the moment. Piling said: \"In refining the elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice—within the body, a yang naturally arises.\" Ma Ziran said: \"Do not choose the hour to distinguish *zi* and *wu*; within the hexagrams, separate *Qian* and *Kun*.\" These are the works of the moment.\n\n**Question:** What is the form of the Golden Elixir?\n**Answer:** Its shape is like a pellet, its color like a red tangerine. The *Baopuzi* says: \"Large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine, within it a fine flavor sweet as honey. The śramaṇa obtains it for meditation; the Daoist in yellow robes obtains it to transcend. Examine it, practice it, and Heaven and Earth are complete.\" The *Yuanshu Song* says: \"Have you not seen how a grain of Golden Elixir blazes red? Large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine. Each person’s portion is originally complete; every night the numinous light fills the chamber.\" For each person is fully endowed, each is originally complete—know that it is not a material thing. Master Lü said: \"The Returned Elixir is one’s original substance.\"\n\n**Question:** Where exactly is the \"Mysterious Pass\"?\n**Answer:** It is in the human head. The work is easy, but the starting point is hard to find. Without a true teacher’s transmission through the crown, all efforts are in vain.\n\n**Question:** What is \"true emptiness\"?\n**Answer:** Returning to the origin and restoring the primordial is true emptiness. Yaolin said: \"Not knowing the marvelous elixir formula, one spends the whole day eating true emptiness.\"\n\n**Question:** What is \"application\"?\n**Answer:** Like the wasp adopting the larva, transmitting essence and conveying spirit.\n\n**Question:** What is \"spirit emergence\"?\n**Answer:** If one can guard the true One, the true blackness congeals of itself, and the yang spirit gathers of itself. For with the one heart, one moves all qi; when qi abides, spirit abides. Through long accumulation of true force, when the work is complete and conduct perfected, one then regulates the spirit to exit the shell.\n\n**Question:** What is \"transcendence\"?\n**Answer:** *Chao* means to exit—this is the emergence of spirit. *Tuo* means to shed the mortal frame—all depart through the Heavenly Gate. The ancient sages had verifications of shedding the shell: the Sixth Patriarch emerged from a seven-tiered pagoda, Zhong and Lü emerged from a three-story red tower, and Lord Haichan soared out through the Heavenly Gate on a crane. A poem says:\n*When the work is complete, you must exit the capital of spirit;*\n*The inner court’s splendor must not burden your body.*\n*Master the Five Immortals’ method of transcendence,*\n*Refine the immortal substance and leave the mortal dust.*\n\n**Question:** What is \"liberation through the corpse\"?\n**Answer:** There are five kinds of liberation through the corpse: gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. There are also those who accumulate merit and amass conduct to ascend in broad daylight. At the end of Emperor Huizong’s *Zun Dao Pian*, it is written: \"From ancient times to the present, those who have ascended in flight number over a thousand, and those who have raised their households number over eighty.\" From the *Zhen Gao*.\n\n**Question:** Is the Way of the Golden Elixir not also difficult?\n**Answer:** It is not difficult. Master Ziyang said: \"For the awakened, it is only simple and easy; for the deluded, it grows ever more complex and hard.\" Yaolin said: \"The words of simplicity take no more than half a sentence; the verification of efficacy lies in a single moment.\" Cuixu said: \"The medicine is not far, nor is its gathering difficult.\" Piling said: \"The supreme Dao is not complex—people merely obscure it.\" Ziqing said: \"A single word threads through ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures; but a moment’s work brings boundless ease and joy.\" The Master said: \"The initial work is easy; the difficulty lies in steadfastly guarding the Dao.\"\n\n*The Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection: Great Compendium of the Golden Elixir, Volume Ten Concluded*\n*The Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection:

distinct—\nNightly, we cultivate the lotus within the fire.\n\n**VIII**\nThis Dao is profound, yet within it lies deeper subtlety,\nFather and son through the ages do not transmit it.\nDo not treat the firing times as child’s play—\nWith a true master, study it in meticulous detail.\n\n**IX**\nThe great medicine consists of three: essence, qi, and spirit,\nNaturally, mother and child embrace in intimacy.\nReturning wind blends them into the true body,\nDaily, the work of refinement renews.\n\n**X**\nWater and fire have always dwelt together,\nSeen, they seem present; sought, they

fire-ox.\n\n**XIV**\nBy the hour, replace the day—this is the divine work,\nStudy it carefully, for all is ultimately one.\nNine fortnights, nine revolutions make nine cycles,\nThe golden elixir returns, entering the *Kun* palace.\n\n**XV**\nWithin a single hour, the returning elixir coalesces,\nSeizing the great work of Heaven and Earth.\nGather the remnants of the golden fluid,\nLest they scatter with the rain and wind.\n\n**XVI**\nWood and metal, though separated, must unite,\nWhite snow and yellow sprout share a single bud.\nWith unwavering intent, proceed with the firing

continue the firing times,\nIgnorance of when to stop invites peril.\n\n**XVIII**\nFew know the lead furnace and mercury tripod,\nWood-fluid and metal-essence flourish in season.\nIn the wild battle, you must proceed with the firing times,\nDraw and add, apply without delay.\n\n**XIX**\nIn the gate of sixteen, the enlightened are rare,\nBefore and after the crescent—this is the proper time.\nWith care, harmonize the civil and martial,\nTruly, within nothingness, the child is nurtured.\n\n**XX**\nThe golden crow nightly lodges in the Western River,\nWhen *Li* and *Kan* unite, the mystery deepens.\nNurturing the infant relies solely on the mother,\nThe external furnace augments the work, circling the celestial sphere.\n\n**XXI**\nWhen yang revives within the body at winter

primordial spirit pays homage to the Jade Emperor.\nAfter this meeting in the celestial palace,\nWalking the jade steps becomes an ordinary affair.\n\n**XLVI**\nMisty clouds veil the twelve towers,\nIn the crimson palace, all is still—ten thousand spirits roam.\nIf one asks where my home is,\nI occupy the most exalted scenery.\n\n**XLVII**\nTime and again, I shake off dust to ascend Kunlun,\nMoving the pivot of the cosmos, parting creation.\nDay and night, cycling endlessly in return,\nThe infant’s life endures from this moment on.\n\n**XLVIII**\nThe jade crucible emits swirling clouds,\nThe golden valley nurtures purple mushrooms in mist.\nDiligently irrigate with divine water,\nLest the fire dragon flee in haste.\n\n**XLIX**\nThe white tiger of the western mountains runs wild,\nThe azure dragon of the eastern sea cannot be withstood.\nIf the mother of *kun* comes to subdue them,\nSeize them together and hide them in the grotto.\n\n**L**\nWhen heretical demons suddenly display their might,\nBrandish the seven-starred sword and advance.\nIndeed, at the battleground of the ghost’s den,\nSeize a single luminous pearl and return.\n\n**LI**\nThe natural ancestral shrine is the single spirit terrace,\nWithin it lies the immortal, deathless embryo.\nAfter the wondrous cycling of yin and yang’s return,\nThe eight gates of the hexagram’s qi swing open.\n\n**LII**\nWithin the body, one aperture is called the mysterious female,\nLocated at the crossroads of the three passes.\nIf one knows the time and can wield it,\nWood and metal merge, naturally sinking and floating.\n\n**LIII**\nSplit open the mysterious female to reveal the twin gates,\nThe forging work is no ordinary task.\nFor scholars to know the precise point,\nFace the Northern Dipper and look south.\n\n**LIV**\nThe root and stem of the great Dao are known by few,\nHow could common folk recognize its daily use?\nFor you, I point out the immortal’s cave—\nA single aperture, curved like the crescent moon.\n\n**LV**\nTime and again, I shake off dust to ascend Kunlun,\nTreading the mysterious pass, the gate of all wonders.\nWielding the sword, I split open heaven and earth’s lock,\nThe golden crow and jade hare devour each other.\n\n**LVI**\nLast night, the divine maiden opened the numinous door,\nI glimpsed immortals gathering in the Purple Tenuity.\nThe Northern Dipper and Southern Asterism arrayed front and back,\nThe two wheels of sun and moon flew to and fro.\n\n**LVII**\nPonder it carefully—how wondrous it is!\nEach morning, I urge the nine rosy clouds’ cup.\nIf you can make the earthly soul transport essence and turn,\nThe celestial soul will naturally come to bless your longevity.\n\n**LVIII**\nRefining the self and cultivating the heart hold the deepest meaning,\nTo cultivate the heart, one must recognize heaven’s heart.\nThe immortal’s wondrous secret is not complex—\nRefine the yang spirit to dissolve the host of yin.\n\n**LIX**\nFrom Kunlun’s peak straight to the mud pill,\nAll day, I climb and descend of my own accord.\nIf you seek long life and transcendence,\nIn the end, you will not depart from your own body.\n\n**LX**\nWithin the tiny pot, another heaven unfolds,\nAn iron ox plows the land to sow golden lotuses.\nSuch scenes exist in every household,\nYet why do people of this age not learn immortality?\n\n**LXI**\nIn the depths of the azure pool, seize the luminous pearl,\nToss it upward with a flip of the hand to the great void.\nEntrust it to the yellow matron to gather,\nTransforming it into golden liquid, congealing into butter.\n\n**LXII**\nTo refine the elixir, seek the root-source,\nBorn in the prior heaven and the posterior heaven.\nIf the valley spirit is forever undying,\nWhy fear this body will not become immortal?\n\n**LXIII**\nClinging to texts and muddying images are not real,\nOnly by attaining the image and forgetting words does one approach truth.\nGenerally, refining the elixir follows images and models,\nFor all ten thousand transformations originate in the human body.\n\n**LXIV**\nThe immortal classics speak in myriad layers,\nYet the Dao lies in the common person’s daily use.\nIf you can invert and cycle it yourself,\nNo need to traverse ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains.\n\n**LXV**\nHow many have been vexed in seeking immortality,\nLoving the cultivation of truth yet not recognizing truth.\n\n**LXVI**\nIf you obtain the red lead and black mercury,\nRefine them into the supreme treasure, transcending the dusty world.\n\n**LXVII**\nThough but a tiny crucible within,\nAbove and below mirror heaven and earth in their patterns.\nIf you know the time and can apply it,\nThe golden crow and jade hare will come from west to east.\n\n**LXVIII**\nTo realize non-doing is true doing,\nQuietly cultivate the wondrous principle, delighting in the subtle.\nStanding at the river’s edge through many cycles of sun and moon,\nYou cast your line to hook the black turtle.\n\n**LXIX**\nAt Jade Capital’s Primordial Beginning, upon the jasper terrace,\nPurple qi congeals in the void as palace gates swing open.\nKnock thrice or four times at the western grotto’s gate,\nAnd the immortals of the nine heavens all arrive as one.\n\n**LXX**\nIn the midst of vagueness dwells the purest essence,\nDragon’s chant and tiger’s roar are most worth hearing.\nThe dark pearl flies past Kunlun’s heights,\nThe river chariot of day and night never pauses.\n\n**LXXI**\nAlone I tread Kunlun’s slopes, gazing into the distant void,\nDragon’s hum and tiger’s roar are perfectly clear.\nThe jade pool constantly drips the marrow of yin and yang,\nThe golden tripod ever cooks the essence of sun and moon.\n\n**LXXII**\nWithin this body lies one’s own essence and qi,\nWhy trouble others with petty inquiries?\nBegin swift cultivation—even now it is late—\nI urge you: turn back, do not procrastinate.\n\n**LXXIII**\nHow many in this world taste bitterness of heart,\nFailing to comprehend true cultivation, they harm their own truth.\nEssence leaks, qi withers, spirit departs,\nPiercing the numinous to enter another shell, lost in the ford.\n\n**LXXIV**\nThe prior heaven and prior earth hold the profoundest mystery,\nThose of shallow fortune cannot encounter it.\nOnce true lead is gathered, refine it swiftly—\nI urge you: do not delay further.\n\n**LXXV**\nDisciples fail to recognize the gold within water,\nSeeking it haphazardly in all directions.\nOnly black lead is the supreme treasure,\nOriginally dwelling in the *dui* position, lodged in *ren*.\n\n**LXXVI**\nDisciples fail to recognize the lead of the watery realm,\nWhere yin and yang are inverted, the position belongs to *qian*.\nVaguely it dwells in the *kan* position,\nYet clearly it is born at the edge of the *dui* palace.\n\n**LXXVII**\nTo refine the returning elixir, first enter the chamber,\nNo different from a woman conceiving.\nOnce the sacred embryo congeals and rounds into completion,\nIts comings and goings, its movements and stillness, know no constraint.\n\n**LXXVIII**\nDo not deceive with exposed heart and split belly—\nHasten to tend the great medicine furnace yourself.\nSeek the *jiazi* within sixty *jia*,\nDevote your efforts within three thousand days.\n\n**LXXIX**\nSome heterodox schools indulge in lust,\nForcing yang to return, they seize another’s yin.\nHolding heaven’s dew in the mouth, they call it medicine,\nLike dredging mud, their efforts are in vain.\n\n**LXXX**\nSealing the tail gate, they claim it as the Dao,\nYet where are the tiger’s roar and dragon’s chant?\nThe primal yang stirs without walls or barriers,\nMistaking yellow mud for gold.\n\n**LXXXI**\nThe great medicine of the golden elixir is most profound,\nThe celestial mechanism of the highest realm is not idly transmitted.\nI report to recent cultivators of the Dao:\nTo refine essence without ceasing is also futile.\n\n**LXXXII**\nHaving received the immortal master’s true oral formula,\nI dare reveal the subtle in these humble lines.\nLet disciples thoroughly investigate this,\nFor within these poems, every verse exposes the mechanism.\n\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating Truth: The Great Compendium of the Golden Elixir, Scroll Eleven* (conclusion)\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating Truth: The Great Compendium of the Golden Elixir, Scroll Twelve* (begins)\n\n**The Song of Delighting in the Dao**\n*Composed by Zixu Liaozhenzi Xiao Tingzhi Yuanrui*\n\nAbandoning delusion to return to truth, hidden amidst worldly dust,\nRefining lead, simmering mercury—coalescing the returning elixir.\nMen of this age scorn the Way of long life,\nTheir hearts ensnared by sound and form, lost in dreams.\n\nLiaozhenzi delights in the Dao,\nMarvelous indeed—turning the heart early.\nFleeting fame, fleeting gain—all empty splendor,\nIn this world, only cultivating truth is good.\n\nSpeak of cultivating truth—many do,\nYet none grasp its inner or outer workings.\nBy chance, on Elixir Mountain, I met a perfected one,\nA single word from him shattered all my doubts.\n\nReturning with the formula, I tested its refinement:\nDragon and tiger clashed in but a moment.\nClouds gathered, rain dispersed—all sounds stilled,\nYet through the night, wind and rain shook ten thousand peaks.\n\nClearing land, cutting thatch to build the spirit-chamber,\nSealing the pass, cutting off the vulgar and the foul.\nMotionless in the thatched hut, guarding the One,\nThe jade furnace tended, its fire never idle.\n\nFrom now on, I trample the gate of life and death,\nLeap free from the demon’s pass.\nOn Kunlun’s summit, I may come and go,\nAt times leading the primordial spirit forth and back again.\n\nDelighting in the Dao, refining the golden elixir,\nThe five qi harmonized, the jade cavern vast.\nClapping hands, I laugh and blow the flute without holes,\nTossing the mysterious pearl through nine bends.\n\nWhen lead-dragon and mercury-tiger mate,\nIn an instant, flames soar, scorching the heavens.\nRegulating the fire’s work demands care,\nNeither rigid nor yielding—neither civil nor martial—restrain the will.\n\nMorning and evening, hexagrams *Tun* and *Meng* hold sovereign and minister,\nKnowing sufficiency, ever sufficient, return to the root.\nAdvance must be brief, retreat must be long,\nSpring, summer, autumn, winter—follow the sequence.\n\nThe twenty-eight constellations gather in one crucible,\nWater and fire must distinguish front and rear ranks.\nHexagrams *Fu* and *Lin* require gentle nurturing,\nWhile *Guan* and *Yu* demand withdrawal for bathing.\n\nThe work of return enters the *Kun* palace,\nRefined into something firm and solid as a single mass.\nSuch skill emerges from the master’s hand—\nI ask those of this age: do you comprehend?\n\nLiaozhenzi delights in the Dao,\nMarvelous indeed—turning the heart early.\nWith soiled face and disheveled hair, as it pleases,\nIn solitude, no one disturbs my peace.\n\nThirst quenched with golden and jade nectars,\nHunger sated with intersecting pears and fiery jujubes.\nThe twin wheels of sun and moon drift west and east,\nGazing upward, I fathom the workings of creation.\n\nThe west, *Dui*’s metal, belongs to *You*,\nThe east, *Zhen*’s wood, belongs to *Mao*.\nThe numinous terrace gleams, untended by men,\nThe mysterious altar stands silent, unswept.\n\nRefining essence into qi, qi into spirit,\nYet the greatest treasure is essence and spirit as one.\nMetal and wood naturally converge,\nWater fears excess, fire fears dryness.\n\nLike a dragon nurturing its pearl, ever watchful,\nLike a hen brooding her eggs, ever embracing.\nThe golden liquid returning elixir lies before your eyes—\nMany are lost, few awaken.\n\nSome refine and consume it day and night,\nIts flavor surpassing fine wine—truly exquisite.\nAsk me of my present practice:\nIt does not depart from the true aperture at the crown.\n\nEmerging from the void’s misty expanse,\nPrior to heaven, prior to earth—this is the great Dao.\nIf disciples awaken to the great returning elixir,\nWithin this song, seek its subtleties.\n\nShould I mislead disciples by even a hair’s breadth,\nTen thousand kalpas of wind and blade await my trial.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of Contentment in the Thatched Hut**\n\nA thatched hut, seven feet high,\nNine feet wide when laid crosswise.\nOne carefree master dwells within,\nDreading guests who bring disturbance.\n\nHungry, a few plain rice grains suffice,\nWeary, sleep comes with clothes still on.\nFor love of this tranquility,\nAll affairs are cast aside.\n\nNightly by Qujiang’s bend,\nI scoop water to toy with the bright moon.\nWith both feet upturned, inverting the Dipper,\nI settle my breath, concentrate my spirit, and enter the qi’s fullness.\n\nJade nectar, brewed, descends from heaven,\nFlowing over my tongue, sweet as honey.\nNine cups drunk, then nine more,\nNow clear, now rich—I sip at leisure.\n\nThis realm—how wondrous, how rare!\nDrunk, I embrace Yang Fei in shared delight.\nWithin this body, husband and wife reside,\nMother and child in one form, vivid and alive.\n\nLike a dragon nurturing its pearl, never forgetting,\nLike a hen brooding her eggs, qi unbroken.\nAs the cold cicada sips the dawn breeze,\nAs the old oyster holds the autumn moon.\n\nDrunk, I sing aloud, shouting once—\nThe void shatters like autumn’s finest hair.\nTruly content—few understand,\nVague and indistinct, as if mad.\n\nGazing upward, I marvel at creation’s work:\nThe sun returns eastward, the moon still west.\nSeizing the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit,\nOne floats, one sinks—the pearl takes flight.\n\nSilently moving heaven and earth through *Pi* and *Tai*,\n*Tun* and *Meng*’s ebb and flow—advance and retreat.\nMetal and wood naturally resolve their union,\nMutual generation and conquest hold subtle mysteries.\n\nBefore the furnace, apply the firing regimen—restrain the will,\nThe divine water’s bathing demands caution against peril.\nIn a year’s twelve months,\nWood’s liquid and metal’s essence shun the hare and cock.\n\nIn the tenth month, the embryo is shed, swallowed into the belly,\nThe ninefold work completed in an instant.\nDo not treat the fire’s timing as child’s play—\nWith immortals, ponder it carefully.\n\nIf the return deviates by even a hair’s breadth,\nMercury flees, lead scatters—they fail to unite.\nDisciples, in this, reflect deeply:\nFrom seven sevens comes forty-eight.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, the numbers do not escape,\nThis is the most profound oral formula.\nIf the Silver River meets the Dipper and Ox,\nSeal the furnace tightly—do not leak lightly.\n\nDo not let gods or ghosts witness the work’s beginning,\nSimmering the jade furnace into white snow.\nMercury was originally the black turtle’s liver,\nCinnabar is the red phoenix’s blood.\n\nThere is civil and martial, rigid and yielding,\nAdvance and retreat, coming and going—distinguish them finely.\nNurturing the infant, waging wild battle,\nThe work within the moment must be spoken.\n\nTruly content—few understand,\nIn the thatched hut’s wild seclusion, few tread.\nWith soiled face and disheveled hair, delighting in the Dao,\nLike a fish drinking water—only I know.\n\nAmid clouds, drinking alone, toasting in rounds,\nBeneath pines, reciting poems without rhyme.\nOn the five peaks, autumn high, white phoenixes soar,\nIn the nine springs, spring warm, black turtles nurture.\n\nMy own yang spirit leaps exultantly,\nWhile yin ghosts darkly grieve.\nPrimordial essence, endlessly refined,\nJade nectar, ever consumed—never apart.\n\nMy family’s livelihood differs in its work,\nNot to be spoken of to ordinary men.\nFew understand—truly content,\nHaving grasped heaven’s mechanism, ever as if drunk.\n\nDrunk, I pluck a stringless zither,\nEach note within its sound instructs my child in detail.\nExhort the worthy, shun the base and greedy,\nHasten to seek a master, grasp the subtle pointer—\nIf in this life you fail to awaken to true cultivation,\nNext life may not grant such fortune again.\nTurn back, seize the Purple Gold Elixir,\nRefine it, and you ascend as an immortal.\n\n**Sword Song**\nTwo branches of wisdom-swords buried in true earth,\nDrawn from their sheaths, they roar like storm and rain.\nWithout these tools for elixir-refining,\nA thousand scholars, ten thousand will err.\nOnly the meticulous grasp the sword’s secret,\nWielding its essence, they move through the ages.\nKnowing the time, they soar into the Great Empyrean,\nClearly finding the path of yin and yang.\nSeizing the Jade Hare, it dares not move,\nWithin the furnace, cinnabar finds its place.\nDiscern its age, judge its floating and sinking,\nAdvance and retreat, distinguish host and guest.\nIn an instant, flames soar to scorch the heavens,\nForging the mysterious essence—subtle, hard to perceive.\nThough its cries seem mournful and bitter,\nIt clings ever fondly to its nurturing mother.\nTo subdue the fiery dragon-child,\nGo north to seek the watery tiger.\nDragon meets tiger, they coil and entwine,\nVaguely, dimly, forming a single mass.\nThe River Chariot bears it to Kunlun’s peak,\nSealed in the earthen crucible, the gate unopened.\nBreath upon breath, unbroken as silk,\nEmbrace the One, guard unity with utmost focus.\nJade nectar ferments, descending from heaven,\nFragrant and sweet, it suffuses the tongue’s tip.\nRefine it, consume it, let it enter the five viscera—\nThis alone is called the Great Return Elixir.\nChronic ailments vanish, spirit and qi refreshed,\nFour limbs harmonized, the body sound and serene.\nTrue fire has always arisen from wood,\nBut without skill in tempering, do not force the drill.\nThe jade furnace’s fire and timing must be gauged—\nFire fears cold, water fears drought.\nIf you obtain the true sword-secret from a master,\nHow could cultivation be difficult?\nFrom iron cliffs and hanging walls, lingering snow,\nIn the jade casket’s depths, the old dragon coils.\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water polishes it to brilliance,\nKnowing the time, lift and pluck it at will.\nShould you encounter the solemn and stern, report swiftly,\nFor heterodox demons will tremble in dread.\nBreaking the Primordial Chaos, chiseling the Undifferentiated,\nYou ensure its coming and going without flaw.\nFocus the mind, steady the will—no need for haste,\nLeft and right, wield it with measured grace.\nThis song I leave for those who meet the sword,\nPonder it deeply, and it may serve as your guide.\n\n**Farewell Song to Hermit Chen, Departing for Mount Wuyi**\nKnocking at my gate, you bid me farewell,\nI open the door, cherishing but a moment’s pause.\nThe Dao resides within—seek it not without,\nWandering ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains is vain.\nListen now, let me speak—\nFew words, yet the true marvelous secret:\nWhen the dragon sings and the tiger roars in the deep night,\nSwiftly drive the River Chariot without pause,\nIn an instant, bear it to the Mud Pill Palace’s peak,\nAdvance the fire in the jade furnace, smelting like snow.\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water, limpid and clear,\nIrrigates the yellow sprout in due season.\nJade nectar, ambrosia—swallow it often,\nThe four limbs steam, the complexion transformed.\nSide doors and minor methods number in the thousands,\nBut only this Dao is most direct.\nWithout, it is neither cinnabar nor sulfur,\nWithin, it is neither essence nor blood.\nRound, it rolls over land, ever companion,\nCrimson, glistening, radiant and pure.\nKnowing the time, gather it when it comes,\nSeal the divine furnace, guard it well.\nNine returns, seven reversals—an instant’s work,\nThe sacred bellows blow, aided by the dawn wind.\nTo recognize the Mysterious Pass’s true location,\nThe laughing child points to the highest peak.\nThe highest peak, fair and wondrous,\nOn its far shore, misty purple mushrooms sprout.\nThis alone is the herb of immortality,\nYet countless cultivators remain unaware.\nI dash off these few lines, spilling heaven’s mechanism—\nYou strap on your straw sandals and depart,\nBut when, after all, will you return?\nI send word to the immortals: do not speculate,\nWait until my work is complete,\nThen I shall surely come to Wuyi, bones transformed.\n\n**Song for Mount Zou’s Peak**\nYou and I unravel the diagrams and texts,\nGrasping at emptiness—what form does it take?\nThe mechanism lies in the heart, skill in the hand,\nFrom nothing, something is born.\nThe perfected one wields the twin swords—\nMale and female, they soar through the great void,\nWielding thunder and lightning.\nAt midnight, when they roar,\nThey point and shatter the faces of yin demons.\nSeizing the luminous pearl, they return,\nNot to be shown to ordinary men.\nA single clash settles great peace,\nThe Primordial Lord sits enthroned in the Three Clarities’ hall.\nThe delicate maiden weds the Golden Duke,\nIn the bridal chamber’s depths, clouds and rain thicken.\nThe fair-faced young lord rides the white tiger,\nThe green-clad maiden straddles the green dragon.\nBy the Cowherd and Weaver’s river, they meet,\nThen lock the gate within the Central Palace.\n\nCultivating the natural true fire-timing,\nStirring the heavens to forge a crimson crucible.\nThe Golden Duke falls silent, the Crone perishes—\nNine returns, seven reversals, all in a moment’s work.\nHad not the chill of Ou’s transmission passed down the sword’s secret,\nHow could a path open through the azure vault?\n\nThis livelihood rests solely in the twin swords,\nSharp as wind, swift as water through a\n\n**Eight**\nThe twin gates of the spine pierce the crown—\nthis is the mystic gate of the Great Dao.\nGolden elixir springs from this very root;\nits great essence lies in knowing when to move.\n\nTemper the wild battles, guard the city walls,\nswallow often the jade liquid of the Flower Pool.\nKeep the jade crucible ever warm with gentle fire,\ndiscerning the herb’s ripeness or tenderness.\n\n**Nine**\nThe art of fire-tempering is no small skill—\na hair’s breadth misstep brings vast difference.\nIf the crucible’s mercury flees and black lead takes flight,\nfrom this moment your resolve may falter.\n\nSeek a true master’s counsel in detail,\nlest reckless action lead you astray.\nSubtle and profound, the deepest mechanism—\neven in speech, restraint is required.\n\n**Ten**\nAt the Nine-Bend River’s head, against the raging waves,\nin an instant you surge past the heart of heaven.\nAtop Kunlun’s peak, the waters settle clear—\nfermented, the nectar of jade is yours to drink.\n\nNow is the time to gather and refine,\nthe River Chariot’s movement never ceasing.\nYin and yang, black and white, rise and sink—\nlock the Jade Gate fast, secure and firm.\n\n**Eleven**\nThe medicine arises in the southwest, in the earth of Kun,\nthe golden elixir’s root lies solely here.\nLet the seeker ponder deeply, trace its mystery—\nno marvel surpasses the true seed.\n\nOnce this is accomplished, all ten thousand things are complete;\nno need to divide east, west, south, or north.\nClinging to texts and rigid forms—how can one penetrate?\nLike a mute describing dreams.\n\n**Twelve**\nThe Great Dao of golden liquid and returning elixir,\npassed down once in ten thousand kalpas by the ancients.\nWith whole heart they laid bare its secrets,\nguiding others to transcend and reach the Dao’s shore.\n\nDo not blame the leaking of heaven’s mechanism—\nbeyond this mystery, there is no deeper mystery.\nHanded down through ten thousand generations to the worthy,\nthose with eyes may clearly see.\n\n---\n\n**Twelve Songs of Nanxiang**\n*(Named for the southwest, the birthplace of the medicine.)*\n\n**One**\nTrue mercury and true lead,\nborn in the prior heaven and the posterior

two substances,\nnaturally enfold one another in mutual embrace.\nAs the *Cantong Qi* states:\n“At the moon’s dark phase, they envelop one another,\nconcealed within their walled enclosure.”\nExhaust the cyclical earth phases, determine the metal and wood.\nThe Golden Elixir of Return cannot be wrought without earth;\none must thoroughly investigate true earth.\nAn ancient song says:\n“The Five

then is the Dao of birth for *geng* and *jia* made clear.”\nThe Western Flower Saint Mother declares:\n“To birth *jia* and birth *geng* is to become the ancestor of the Great Elixir.”\n\nTrue earth is the position of *kun*.\nAbove the Magpie Bridge, below the Magpie Bridge—\nhere Master Cui again points to the upper and lower two sources.\nThe Magpie Bridge is the Celestial River.\nWhen one’s practice mirrors the Celestial River’s ceaseless flow,\nabove and below become inexhaustible.\n\nHeaven responds to the stars, earth responds to the tides.\nIn heaven, it responds to the stars, like the Dipper’s handle turning in the sky;\non earth, it responds to the tides, like the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.\nAs the *Song of the Pivotal Axis* says:\n“The tide beneath the earth, the moon above the heavens.”\n\nRouse the *xun* wind, move the *kun* fire.\nRest is wind;\nfire cannot flame on its own—\nit must rely on wind to fan it.\nMaster Zhongli’s Elixir Instructions:\n“The

converge.\n\nEnter the Yellow Chamber, form the supreme treasure.\nAfter the fire tally is activated,\nit is guided into the Yellow Chamber,\nwhere the supreme treasure coalesces.\nThe Yellow Chamber, also called the Yellow Flower or the Mysterious Pass—\na single aperture, the true earth, hence the Yellow Chamber.\n\nWater fears dryness, fire fears cold.\nIn refining the Golden Elixir,\nthe entire process depends on the fire’s regulation.\nWhen adding water, it tempers the fire’s aridity;\nwhen moving the fire, one must guard against its chill.\nThus water fears both excess and dryness,\nfire fears both aridity and cold.\nThere are measures and methods—\none must regulate them evenly,\nensuring neither excess nor deficiency.\n\nDeviate by a hair’s breadth, and the Elixir will not form.\nWhen moving the fire, adjust with meticulous care—\nthe slightest misstep severs heaven from earth.\nMaster Ziyang’s verse:\n“A hair’s breadth of deviation, and the Elixir will not form.”\n\nLead-dragon ascends, mercury-tiger descends.\nLead is fire, the dragon—\nsinking and dwelling below.\nMercury is water, the tiger—\nfloating and dwelling above.\nThe Perfected One of Great White’s song:\n“When the Five Phases do not proceed in order,\nthe tiger is born within water;\nwhen the Five Phases are inverted,\nthe dragon emerges from within fire.”\nThrough methodical regulation, they naturally ascend and descend.\n\nDrive the two substances, do not let them stray.\nWhen dragon and tiger ascend and descend,\none must grasp and guide them, never allowing them to wander.\n\nBorn in *kun*, planted in *qian*—\nthe medicine is born in the southwest, the domain of *kun*;\nborn in the earth of *kun*, it is then transplanted to the palace of *qian*.\nThe principle of the upper and lower two sources is thus made clear.\n\nOnly with utmost sincerity does the method follow nature.\n\nTrue One Master said: Utmost sincerity in refining this medicine is the Way of ascending in broad daylight. Master Yin the True said: Without attaining the proper ground, do not act recklessly. One must conceal, guard, and protect it with care, preserving the celestial and terrestrial mechanism. To steal from Heaven and Earth, to seize the transformations of Creation—all refinement steals the mechanism of Heaven and Earth, seizes the marvel of Creation’s transformations. In application, it accords with the *qian*-*kun* hexagrams of prosperity and decline; in extraction and addition, it mirrors the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.\n\nSet the water clock, divide the two crescents, separate midnight and noon, join yin and yang, connect the dark and new moons, unite dragon and tiger. Follow the great reckoning of Heaven and Earth, invoke the transformative mechanism of yin and yang. The *yin* tally and *yang* fire adhere to the hexagrams’ lines, cycling endlessly, circulating and interchanging without losing their timing. Within a single crucible, the transformations of Creation are manifest, mirroring Heaven and Earth’s movement in generating the myriad things. If the fire-timing is lost, extraction and addition exceed bounds, cold and heat fail to correspond, advance and retreat diverge—then how, within Heaven and Earth, could the myriad things be born? By what means would yin and yang’s *qi* generate dragon and tiger?\n\nBore through the Five Phases, meet the Eight Trigrams. The five directions take the center as their master; the Five Phases take earth as their master. Occupying the center with the virtue of earth’s dignity, thus water attains earth and conceals its form, fire attains earth and veils its brightness, metal attains earth and enhances its luster, wood attains earth and increases its moisture. Earth has no fixed form, yet it arranges the four images. When the Five Phases gather, the Eight Trigrams naturally converge.\n\nTrue water, true fire—within *li* there is yin, so the fluid within the heart is true water. Within *kan* there is yang, so the fire within the kidneys is true fire. These are the true water and fire of the body. When water and fire merge, one never ages. The earth’s vapor rises to become mist; the sky’s darkness descends to become dew. Yin and yang unite to form nourishing rain, which brings flourishing to the myriad things. Within the body, yin and yang merge to form true fluid, nourishing the five viscera and six bowels, then returning to the lower *dantian* to congeal as the elixir. Thus, without yin and yang, *qi* does not arise; without fluids, the five viscera and six bowels sicken.\n\nWater flows, fire flames—water is above and thus flows downward; fire dwells below and thus blazes upward. The *Cantong Qi* says: “Water flows but does not blaze upward; fire burns fiercely but does not moisten downward.” This is the meaning. Within the body, it can be verified. True water and true fire exist within the human body, and in the moment of refinement, they can be tested.\n\nThis is *xing* and *ming*, not spirit and *qi*. The left is *xing*, which belongs to *li*; the right is *ming*, which belongs to *kan*. The central yin of *kun* enters *qian* to form *li*; the central yang of *qian* enters *kun* to form *kan*. Know that *li* and *kan* are *xing* and *ming*, the essence of spirit and *qi*.\n\nThe lead of the water realm is but a single flavor—water is *kan*, lead is metal, also called the metal within water. The *Yunfang Elixir Formula* says: “Lead, lead of the water realm, numinous source of *geng* and *xin*, its chamber belongs to *qian*, it constantly dwells at *kan*’s gate, concealed at *dui*’s edge.” Liu Haichan’s poem says: “To refine the elixir, one must have the lead of the water realm—this single flavor is the root and stem of the returned elixir.”\n\nReturn to the root aperture, recover the root of *ming*. Having attained the upper and lower two sources, this is the aperture for returning to the root and recovering *ming*. Pierce the *weilü*, connect the *niwan*. Above, it connects to the *niwan* palace; below, it pierces the *weilü* gate, signifying the ceaseless circulation of a single *qi* between above and below.\n\nTrue key, true crucible and furnace—*The Treatise on Ascending and Descending* says: “If one can emulate Heaven and Earth’s use of the key, opening lets *qi* exit, closing lets *qi* enter. *Qi*’s exit resembles earth’s *qi* rising; *qi*’s entry resembles heaven’s *qi* descending. With a single *qi* circulating endlessly, one may attain the same longevity as Heaven and Earth.” The upper is called the golden crucible, the lower the jade furnace—yet both are the true transformations of the human body.\n\nWithin nonbeing there is being; within being there is nonbeing. *The Golden and Azure Scripture* says: “Being and nonbeing mutually restrain; above, the Azure Dragon resides. The two nonbeings honor the one being—its numinous transformations are wondrous and hard to fathom.” The *Cantong Qi* says: “Above closed is called being; below empty is called nonbeing. Nonbeing serves the above, where the spirit’s virtue resides. These two apertures’ method illustrates how being and nonbeing require each other.”\n\nEntrust the Yellow Dame, match the Maiden of Cinnabar—the Maiden of Cinnabar dwells in the *li* palace; the *kan* youth cannot unite with her without the Yellow Dame’s mediation. The Yellow Dame is *kun* earth. Gently, silently act. When advancing the fire, one should move gently and act silently. Master Xinglin’s poem says: “Quietly conduct the fire-timing, silently move the initial line.” This is the way.\n\nWithin a day, the twelve hours; within a year, use the months—one month’s 360 hours correspond to a year. Within a month, take the days—one day’s twelve hours correspond to a month. Within a day, use the hours; within an hour, use the quarters. At this level of subtlety, nothing is not oral instruction. Where intention reaches, all can be done. Within the twelve hours of a day, when a single yang stirs, one may begin. Master Ziyang said: “A moment’s effort contains a year’s seasonal timing.” This is the instantaneous celestial revolution. Ma Ziran’s poem says: “Without distinguishing midnight and noon within the hour, how can one separate *qian* and *kun* within the lines?”\n\nDrink the *daogui*, perceive Heaven’s artistry—flying swords are refined from earth and metal, hence “drinking the *daogui*.” The upper and lower two sources are both true earth. To perceive is to observe. *The Flourishing of the Yin Tally* says: “Observe Heaven’s Way, grasp Heaven’s movement—this is perfection.” Discern the new and full moons, know dusk and dawn.\n\nOne may discern the new and full moons within the body. Dusk and dawn correspond to the two hexagrams *Zhun* (Morning Layering) and *Meng* (Evening Darkness). Distinguish floating and sinking, clarify host and guest—lead sinks while silver floats; lead is heavy and lies below, silver is light and rises above. Having discerned floating and sinking, one must clarify host and guest. Master Ziyang’s poem says: *“Though he be host, I remain guest.”* There is no other reason: this is the principle of first ascending, then descending. For union, let there be no separation. Water and fire must always unite; let them not be kept apart.\n\nWhen gathering the medicine, regulate the fire’s work. At the time of gathering the medicine, all depends on harmonizing the fire’s function. One firm, one yielding; one civil, one martial. Seal the gate at two and eight, secure with six and one. Follow the hexagram’s text, trace the clepsydra’s flow, divide the two crescents, separate midnight and noon—beginning with *Fu* (Return) and ending with *Kun* (Receptive). *The Kinship of the Three* says: *“Lead must be true lead, and fire must be true fire.”* How could one not carefully harmonize them to avoid excess or deficiency?\n\nReceiving qi is auspicious; guard against its turning inauspicious. Master Ziyang’s poem says: *“At first receiving qi, it comes easily; in drawing and adding fire, one must guard against danger.”* At the outset of receiving qi, metal and wood merge, water and fire share a realm—how joyous this seems! Yet when it sheds its form to return to *Kun*, one bathes it to prevent misfortune, guards the city to anticipate peril.\n\nWhen the fire’s work is complete, do not harm the elixir. When the nine revolutions of fire are fulfilled, cease the talismanic fire. Not knowing when to stop will surely cause the numinous mercury to fly away. Heaven and earth are wondrous, creation is strange—this speaks of their uncanny power, which must not be indulged.\n\nAt the initial formation of the embryo, observe one’s natal destiny. When the sacred embryo first forms, look to the moment of receiving qi—this is the natal destiny. At the final shedding of the embryo, observe the four cardinal directions. When the embryo is fully shed, observe the four cardinal palaces, which are the Mysterious Pass.\n\nProceed in secrecy, and every phrase will resonate. If one practices this with utmost care, every word will prove true. Master Lü’s poem says: *“Reading Cui’s *Mirror of Gathering Medicine* / Makes one’s heart-ground ever clearer.”*\n\n**Interpreting Master Chang’s *Spring in the Qin Garden*:**\nThe Seven-Return Elixir—fire generates two, completing the number seven. “Return” means ascending from below; “reversion” means descending from above. Some say wood (three) and metal (four) combine to make seven, hence “seven returns”—this explanation is also apt. For metal and wood are the parents of water and fire, the ancestors of the Five Phases, the root of the reverted elixir. To take snivel, spittle, saliva, essence, qi, blood, and fluid as the “seven returns” is utterly mistaken. Master Yunfang’s poem says: *“Seven yin substances— / If one takes these as the seed of the elixir, / How could one ascend to the Jade Capital?”* Master Ziyang’s scripture says: *“What use are these seven yin things?”*\n\nThe names of the reverted elixir are many: Great Elixir, Inner Elixir, Jade Flask Elixir, Crimson Snow Elixir, Radiant Cinnabar Elixir, Dragon-Tiger Supreme Medicine, Nine-Turn Spirit Elixir, Cosmic Lord Spirit Elixir, White Snow, Tortoise Essence, Phoenix Blood, Hare Marrow, Raven Liver, Primordial Qi of Heaven and Earth. Yet all are but the union of true lead and true mercury—never the coarse lead, mercury, minerals, plants, or material medicines. Mercury is the nine-turn true mercury; lead is the seven-return true lead. This single flavor is the true qi of heaven and earth, the purest essence of sun and moon. Externally, it mirrors the images of *Qian* and *Kun*; internally, it accords with the workings of creation. It gives life and brings death, becomes tiger and dragon, harbors affection and duty to act as husband and wife, binds ancestors and descendants to be called mother and child.\n\nOnce these two flavors are understood, their natures must be known. Through the matchmaker, male and female harmonize; through the mother, children and grandchildren grow. The sages’ deepest secret is profoundly mysterious—those who cultivate the elixir should seek it within themselves.\n\nFirst, one must refine the self and await the time. The Dao is not far from man; the common people use it daily yet do not know it. Refining the self is the way of refining the form. It is nothing less than splitting open primordial chaos, cleaving apart the undifferentiated, gathering the essence of the True One, embracing the radiance of the primordial, to lay the foundation of the elixir. One cannot use heterogenous elements for creation. Thus *The Kinship of the Three* says: *“Swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses. / Of the same kind, transformation comes easily; of different species, skill is hard to apply.”*\n\nThe Master of Golden Flower Grotto answered the Mount Taishi Hermit: *“Accumulate the yang hun, dissolve the yin po, and use the yang soldiers to repel the yin bandits. / The eight trigrams interact, the Five Phases overcome one another, returning to the root and recovering destiny—thus the elixir blazes forth. / Refine the form with essence, not with mere cinnabar or stone.”* Some take “refining the self” to mean “refining earth”—this explanation is also apt, for the medicine arises in the southwest, the region of *Kun*.\n\nThe essential is to know the time. If one misses the time, how can heaven and earth rely on seasonal nodes to generate the radiance of yin and yang? How can they give birth to dragon and tiger? The moments before and after the crescent moon are the transformations within the time; the union of *Kan* and *Li* is the work within the clepsydra’s flow. At this level of subtlety, nothing is not oral instruction.\n\nWhen the first yang stirs, the midnight clepsydra runs long. The cosmos is in your hands; the myriad transformations are in your body. The Master of Piling said: *“To refine the elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice— / Within the body, a yang naturally arises. / Within the time, there is the work of time; within the clepsydra’s flow, there is the work of the clepsydra.”*\n\nThe lead crucible is warm, its light piercing the curtain. The lead crucible is the crucible for creating lead. “Warm” refers to the fire’s strength—it must not be deficient, for only through gentle nurturing can the elixir form. The Master of Piling said: *“The golden crucible always holds warm water and fire; / The jade furnace must not be allowed to grow cold.”* The curtain refers to the eyes. Master Yunfang has the line: *“Leisurely lowering the curtain, silently observing.”* Where the work is applied, the spirit’s radiance shines brilliantly, penetrating the curtain.\n\nThe workings of creation race in contest, dragon and tiger meet in union.\n\nNow, the contest of creation’s workings: when the dragon intones, clouds arise; when the tiger roars, winds stir. Thus, the water-tiger seizes the fire-dragon, and they intertwine in union. *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *“The lead-dragon ascends, the mercury-tiger descends; / Drive the two substances—do not let them flee.”* Should the firing be mistimed, dragon and tiger fail to unite, and lead and mercury scatter.\n\nMaster Ziyang’s verse reads:\n*“The white tiger of Western Mountain rages wild, / The azure dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood. / Seized in both hands to wrestle unto death, / They fuse into a mass of purple-golden frost.”*\nTo seize them in both hands is but to ensure their union, that they may congeal into treasure.\n\nThe firing work follows the Dipper’s perilous stars.\n\nNow, fire is the true essence of the Great Yang, named yet formless. Thus *The Kinship of the Three* says: *“Having obtained true lead, one still lacks true fire.”* How lightly could this be discussed? For fire arises within water—why? Kan belongs to water, and within Kan lies true yang, which is true fire. When dragon and tiger unite, metal and wood merge, then true fire flames within.\n\nThe firing work has its hardness and softness, civil and martial, weights and measures, rules and bounds. The double-eight seals the gate; the six-one secures the cauldron. Following the hexagrams’ lines, tracing the clepsydra’s flow, resolving *Zhun* and *Meng*, discerning *Pi* and *Tai*, dividing the crescents, distinguishing dark and new moons—from *Fu*’s beginning to *Kun*’s end, from dawn’s rise to dusk’s close—then yin and yang unfold and coil, metal and mercury harmonize.\n\nYet if the firing timing errs, rains and droughts fall out of season: scorching heat in deep winter, bitter frost in high summer. The golden palace’s cinnabar and mercury fall into discord; the jade crucible breeds locusts in swarms. The metal-mother and wood-dragon seethe and boil; the Kan-man and Li-woman flee in haste. All this stems from misapplied firing, and the numinous mercury takes flight.\n\nAs it is said:\n*“The slightest misalignment invites regret and loss; / A hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir fails to form.”*\nHow could one not proceed with utmost care?\n\nWhen the Dipper aligns with *Niu* and *Dou*, it is the time to apply effort. At the winding river’s rise, the moon’s radiance gleams bright, and a crow takes flight—this is the small intestine, coiled ninefold in twelve bends, called the Winding River. The moon signifies the elixir’s function, its flawless, crystalline coldness marking it as the supreme treasure. The crow in flight embodies yin containing yang. As Liu Haichan’s verse says: *\"How oft it perches in the cassia boughs,\"* and again: *\"The crow flies, the hare unstartled.\"* An ancient poem echoes: *\"A crow flies into the hare’s palace,\"* all conveying this meaning. At that moment, one drinks the *daogui* oneself. When the work of union begins, one acts—gathering from the earthen crucible and imbibing it. Thus *The Mirror of Entering the Elixir* states: *\"Drink the daogui, know the earthen crucible—only then may one speak of the daogui’s subtlety.\"* And who would believe a child is nurtured from nothing? The Way of the Returned Elixir is nothing giving birth to something: gradually gathering, gradually refining, coalescing into the sacred embryo, form arising from formlessness, nurturing the infant. As Master Zi Qing’s poem says: *\"How many times the world’s affairs make one laugh— / A man, too, may conceive a child. / His own essence and blood unite in congress; / Within his body, husband and wife are wondrous indeed.\"*\n\nDiscern the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source. *The Scripture of Clarity and Stillness* states: *\"Heaven is clear, earth is turbid; man is clear, woman is turbid.\"* Clarity is the source of turbidity—nothing more, for yang is clear and yin is turbid. The light and clear float above: true mercury. The heavy and turbid sink below: true lead. These two serve distinct purposes—how could one not distinguish the Way of clarity and turbidity, ascent and descent?\n\nWood and metal stand apart. Wood dwells in the east, *jia-yi*, manifesting as the Azure Dragon, corresponding to the *Zhen* trigram. It is Qian’s eldest son, fire’s mother, metal’s wife—the green-robed maiden, the blue-eyed barbarian child, the Azure Dragon of the Eastern Sea, the essence of wood. Metal resides in the west, *geng-xin*, manifesting as the White Tiger, corresponding to the *Dui* trigram. It is Kun’s youngest daughter, water’s mother, wood’s husband—the white-garbed gentleman, the white-haired elder, the White Tiger of the Western Mountains, the essence of metal. Separated by *mao* and *you*, they cannot meet without the matchmaker’s aid. As Zi Yang says: *\"Wood and metal, sundered, cannot unite without cause; / They must rely on the matchmaker’s guidance.\"* Then wood gives birth to fire, metal to water; water and fire share a realm, and metal and wood merge. Without a teacher’s guidance, this remains obscure.\n\nThe great elixir of golden cinnabar has been passed down once in ten thousand kalpas. The jade bamboo’s sacred scrolls leave nine of ten scholars lost; the sage’s words are transmitted mouth to mouth, heart to heart across generations. Without heart-to-heart transmission and oral instruction, even the talents of the Three Heroes or the wisdom of the Ten Sages, no matter how many ways they ponder, will never begin the work or coalesce the sacred embryo. As the saying goes: *\"Though your wisdom surpass Yan and Min, / Without a wise teacher, do not guess in vain. / For the golden elixir has no oral formula— / Where then will you form the numinous embryo?\"* Liu Haichan’s verse declares: *\"This Way is utterly manifest, / Yet how can one grasp it through wild conjecture?\"* The Way of the Golden Elixir is truly difficult to know without a true teacher.\n\nThe Dao’s essentials are profound and subtle, its celestial mechanisms deep and distant. The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth. The Great Dao is passionless, moving the sun and moon. The Great Dao is nameless, nurturing the ten thousand things. I know not its name—reluctantly, I call it the Dao. Vast and obscure, within it lies essence; dim and indistinct, within it lies substance. Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, untouchable to grasp—from nothing, something arises. Its celestial mechanisms are deep and distant, its mysteries unfathomable. *The Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence* says: *\"Heaven harbors five thieves; to see them is to flourish. / To know and cultivate them is to be called a sage.\"* Without penetrating insight into yin and yang, deep understanding of creation’s workings, how could one cleave open the primordial chaos, gather the roots of heaven and earth’s parents as the foundation of the elixir; rend the vast expanse, extract the pure essence of yin and yang as the substance of the great elixir? Boring through the five phases, harmonizing the four images, the three flowers gather at the crown, ensuring the primal qi does not dim; the five qi ascend to the origin, ensuring the yang soul does not stray. Roaming freely in the boundless dark, traversing the indistinct and vague, one moves in and out, shifts and unites spirit and yang. When the work is complete and merit fulfilled, one attains the rank of celestial immortal.\n\nYet the Way of the Golden Liquor’s Returned Elixir has but one gate—how could it be spoken of in the same breath as lesser, peripheral methods? Begin swiftly, for even now it may be too late. A thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises say nothing of the initial work—only oral formulas transmit it. At the outset, one wields the key to heaven and earth’s treasury, gathers the *daogui* of Kan and Li, draws the body’s spirits into the central palace of the celestial valley. Swallowing and nurturing them, the spirits return to their root—this is called *\"returning the wind.\"* Merging and sealing the root’s source, this is the Way of guarding the true one. *The Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* states: *\"The spirit-chamber’s upper and lower crucibles— / Transformation lies in your hands.\"* Thus the True Unity Master discusses the green serpent’s sword; the Old Man of Western Shu grasps the golden hammer’s subtlety; Master Lü likens it to a firebrand; the Empty Horn of Qingcheng says a sword is not the Way. All these exhaust the traces, dissect the primordial root—without beginning the work, to merely discuss the golden elixir is to achieve nothing. An ancient song says: *\"When the sage grasps creation’s intent, / Hand-seizing sun and moon, he sets them in the furnace.\"* *The Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence* declares: *\"The cosmos lies in your hands, / The ten thousand transformations arise in your body.\"* To study without encountering a teacher is to encounter no one; to encounter one without diligence is to remain a lesser ghost. Laozi said: *\"The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it.\"* The immortal’s Way can only be cultivated by humans. As the ancients said: *\"Immortals are but mortals made.\"*\n\nKnow this: the wheel of rebirth turns endlessly, and karmic retribution is inescapable. Wealth, honor, and glory are but fleeting schemes—begin your practice swiftly, for even now you may fear it is too late.\n\nThe path to Penglai\nrests on three thousand deeds fulfilled,\nalone you tread the clouds to return.\n\nThe three isles of Penglai are the immortal mountains upon the sea. Within the human body, too, there are three isles of Penglai: the crown is the Upper Isle, the heart the Middle Isle, and the kidneys the Lower Isle. Master Zi Qing’s poem says: *\"Within the human body lies a Penglai of its own.\"* The three thousand meritorious deeds are the count of nine years embracing the One. When nine years of practice are complete, one may divide form and scatter radiance, or emerge from being and enter non-being, or ascend lightly on distant journeys—hidden or manifest, beyond all reckoning. Some exchange their bones to ascend as immortals, roaming the Isles of Penglai; others are summoned by the Great One, dwelling in the Central Elixir, each according to the depth of their merit and practice.\n\n*The Broken Headband* says:\n*\"When nine years of practice are complete,\nForm remains in the world, unaware of spring.\nSuddenly the Heavenly Gate shatters at the crown,\nThe perfected one appears with great spiritual power—\nFrom this moment, celestial immortals may offer their congratulations.\"*\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n*\"When the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected,\nOne conceals oneself awaiting the appointed time.\nSummoned by the Great One,\nYou move to dwell in the Central Elixir.\nWhen merit is fulfilled and ascension achieved,\nYou receive the chart and are recorded.\"*\n\nImmortal Peng annotates:\n*\"The Perfected Lord of the Great One presides over inner cultivation. When mortals first attain the Dao, their names are engraved on the golden tablets of this elixir. Receiving the chart and being recorded, they thereby achieve ascension.\"*\n\n*Collected Writings on the Great Achievement of the Golden Elixir, Volume Thirteen* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "*The Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection*\n**Title:** *The Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection*. Sixty scrolls, unattributed, likely composed during the Yuan dynasty. Base text from *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Scroll Nine of *The Great Compendium of the Golden Elixir in the Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection***\n*Recorded by Zixu Liaozhenzi Xiao Tingzhi Yuanrui*\n\n### *Exposition on the Primordial Ultimate Diagram*\nThat which is called the Dao/Way. What is above form is termed the Dao—this is the essence of the Dao. From the Primordial Ultimate (元极) emerges the Supreme Ultimate (太极). Setting aside the three within the ninefold wood number, it encompasses fifty-five numbers. The central ○ is its fundamental essence.\n\nWhen the Supreme Ultimate divides, the Two Modes (两仪) are born. Movement arises from yin; stillness is rooted in yang. Through the transformation of yang and the union of yin, water, fire, earth, metal, and wood are generated.\n\nWater: generative number one, completion number six.\nFire: generative number two, completion number seven.\nWood: generative number three, completion number eight.\nMetal: generative number four, completion number nine.\nEarth: generative number five, completion number ten.\nThese are the generative and completion numbers of the Five Phases.\n\nHeaven-one, Earth-two; Heaven-three, Earth-four; Heaven-five, Earth-six; Heaven-seven, Earth-eight; Heaven-nine, Earth-ten. The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five. These are the odd (yang) and even (yin) numbers.\n\nThat which is called the Dao is the interplay of one yin and one yang; the ceaseless generation of life is called the *Yi* (易). One is the odd number; two is the even number. Yang as odd and yin as even—from two arises three.\n\nPure *Qian* (乾) is nature; the union of two *Qian* forms *Kun* (坤), which is destiny. This is akin to essence and qi. *Qian* repeatedly seeks *Kun* to form *Kan* (坎), wherein the yang within *Kan* is primordial qi—this is what is meant by \"the Dao of *Qian* gives rise to the male.\" *Kun* repeatedly seeks *Qian* to form *Li* (离), wherein the yin within *Li* is true essence—this is what is meant by \"the Dao of *Kun* gives rise to the female.\" *Qian* as male and *Kun* as female refer to transformation through qi.\n\n*Li* symbolizes the sun; *Kan* symbolizes the moon. The union of sun and moon forms the *Wu* (吴). The *Yi* is the Dao of daily practice and simplicity, ever-changing yet never perishing.\n\nThus, the essence within form remains quiescent and unmoving, for what is firm, strong, centered, upright, pure, and refined abides—this is where nature resides and the root of destiny lies. The spirit within the heart responds and connects, for joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure, love, aversion, and desire abide—this is where destiny resides and the pivot of nature lies.\n\nRestraining anger causes the heart-fire to descend; suppressing desire causes the kidney-water to ascend. The noble person, centered in the yellow and penetrating principle, occupies the correct position within the body. Virtue/power resides within, flowing through the four limbs—thus cultivation brings auspiciousness.\n\nThereafter, guarding against deviance and preserving sincerity, one remains foolish all day. When the heavenly principle is wholly preserved, returning to the root is called tranquility; tranquility is called restoration. Movement reaches its extreme and reverts to stillness; stillness reaches its extreme and reverts to movement.\n\nThe myriad things transform—this refers to transformation through form. What is below form is termed \"instrument\"—this is the function of the Dao.\n\nMaster Nanxuan said: Truly recognizing the root is called \"knowing the Dao.\" One who knows this Dao may transcend the bounds of creation and stand alone, towering and self-sustaining.\n\n### *Diagram of the Celestial Heart*\nThe hook lies horizontal like a crescent moon; three points form the platform of stars. The Dipper’s handle revolves; the tiger roars and the dragon intones.\n\n### *Diagram of the Mysterious Female*\nThe valley of emptiness and primal origin, the root of Heaven and Earth. Mysterious and yet more mysterious—this is the gate of all wonders.\n\n### *Diagram of the Accomplished Cauldron*\nLead-water arises from *Li*; mercury-fire roots in *Kan*. They enter the cauldron of mutual support, achieving interpenetration.\n\n### *Diagram of the River Chariot*\nThe true north is perfectly black; sun and moon serve as its wheels. It transports water and circulates fire, ceaseless day and night.\n\n### *Diagram of the Circumambulation of Heaven’s Fire Timing*\n*Diagram of the Fire Timing Talisman for Discharging Heaven’s Fire*",

      "translated_text": "Purple Void Perfected Master Xiao Tingzhi Yuanrui’s *Questions and Answers on the Golden Elixir*\n\n**Question:** What is meant by \"golden liquid returning elixir\"?\n**Answer:** The \"golden liquid\" is golden water. Gold is the mother of water, and the mother conceals the child in her womb—hence the name \"returning elixir.\" As the earlier worthies said: \"The elixir is the cinnabar field; the liquid is the fluid of the lungs. Returning the lung’s fluid to the cinnabar field is called the golden liquid returning elixir.\"\n\n**Question:** What are lead and mercury?\n**Answer:** They are not ordinary black tin or quicksilver. True Unity Master said: \"Lead is the father and mother of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang.\" The sages gather the root of heaven and earth’s parents as the foundation of the great elixir, and collect the pure essence of yin and yang as its substance—this is no common fabrication. Mercury’s nature loves to fly, but when it meets lead, it congeals, for child and mother yearn for each other.\n\n**Question:** What is fire?\n**Answer:** Fire is the true qi of the great yang, the yang within *Kan*. Purple Clarity Perfected said: \"Raising fire from within *Kan*.\"\n\n**Question:** What is a *hou* (phase)?\n**Answer:** Five days make one *hou*, completing one cycle of the *jiazi*. Each day has twelve hours, and five days—sixty hours—complete one *jiazi*. Purple Yang said: \"A moment’s effort contains a year’s seasonal phases.\" When raising the fire, in an instant it circulates the celestial orbit.\n\n**Question:** How is the fire phase applied?\n**Answer:** In a year, use the months; in a month, use the days; in a day, use the hours; in an hour, use the *ke* (quarters).\n\n**Question:** What is the true unity?\n**Answer:** When one stabilizes one’s own celestial authenticity within the celestial valley, this is the Way of guarding the true unity. The Master of the Golden Grotto said: \"The true unity resides within the northern pole’s great abyss.\"\n\n**Question:** What are movement and stillness?\n**Answer:** Yang governs movement; yin governs stillness. Emerald Void said: \"Seek stillness within movement; within stillness, there is action. Movement and stillness have their works—this is transmitted orally.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the ninefold return?\n**Answer:** Metal generates four, and its completion number is nine. \"Return\" means descending from above. Nine is the number of old yang. Yin Perfected Lord said: \"From *zi* to *shen* is the ninefold return, descending in sequence.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the sevenfold reversal?\n**Answer:** Fire generates two, and its completion number is seven. \"Reversal\" means ascending from below. Seven is the number of young yang. Yin Perfected Lord said: \"From *yin* to *shen* is seven, reversing upward.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the furnace?\n**Answer:** In the superior elixir method, the spirit is the furnace, nature is the medicine, stillness is water, and wisdom is fire. In the middle elixir method, the spirit is the furnace, qi is the medicine, the sun is fire, and the moon is water. In the inferior elixir method, the body is the furnace, qi is the medicine, the heart is fire, and the kidneys are water. There are also the recumbent moon furnace and the jade furnace.\n\n**Question:** What is the crucible?\n**Answer:** As Bao Perfected said: \"The golden crucible lies near the muddy pellet.\" This is the Yellow Emperor’s casting of the nine crucibles.\n\n**Question:** What are the medicine and ingredients?\n**Answer:** These very medicines, when followed in sequence, form a person; when reversed, they form the elixir. The five phases inverted yield the seven treasures of the great earth; the five phases in sequence lead to the fiery pit of the dharma realm. The common people use them daily yet remain unaware. Purple Clarity said: \"Gather the medicines within the unchanging.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the divine water and flowery pond?\n**Answer:** Li Quan said: \"The essence of the returning elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond.\" Purple Yang said: \"When lead enters mercury, it is called divine water; when mercury enters lead, it is called the flowery pond.\" Sea Toad said: \"From of old, divine water flows from the lofty source.\" Purple Clarity said: \"The flowery pond resides within the sea of qi.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the three passes?\n**Answer:** The head is the celestial pass, the feet are the earthly pass, and the hands are the human pass.\n\n**Question:** What are the inner three essentials?\n**Answer:** The first essential is the great abyssal pool. The second is the crimson palace. The third is the earthly gate.\n\n**Question:** What are the outer three essentials?\n**Answer:** The mouth and nose together form three orifices—the gateways through which spirit and qi come and go. When practicing, regulate the breath through the nose, restrain the tongue’s qi, and close the *dui*.\n\n**Question:** What is *dui*?\n**Answer:** True Unity Master said: \"*Dui* is the mouth.\"\n\n**Question:** Where do the infant boy and the old woman reside?\n**Answer:** The infant boy is in the kidneys; the old woman is in the heart.\n\n**Question:** The kidneys belong to water and are yin; the infant boy belongs to yang and fire. The heart is yang, yet the old woman is yin—why do they reside there?\n**Answer:** The kidneys belong to *Kan*, where yin contains yang—this is true yang. The heart belongs to *Li*, where yang contains yin—this is true yin.\n\n**Question:** Where is the muddy pellet palace?\n**Answer:** The head has nine palaces; the central one is called the muddy pellet.\n\n**Question:** What is the golden lord?\n**Answer:** The golden-edged lord is lead. Purple Yang said: \"One must seek and subdue the golden lord.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the yellow matron?\n**Answer:** Yellow is the color of earth, and its position belongs to *Kun*—hence the name. Purple Clarity said: \"When the golden lord falls silent and the old woman dies, the yellow matron, though aged, still carries the embryo.\"\n\n**Question:** What about breathing?\n**Answer:** Exhalation issues from the heart and lungs; inhalation draws in the kidneys and liver. Exhalation connects to the celestial root; inhalation connects to the earthly root. When exhaling, the dragon sings and clouds arise; when inhaling, the tiger roars and winds stir.

      "translated_text": "Spirit and qi are mother and child. Master Xu Jing of the Void Clarity said: \"Qi is the origin of life; spirit is the regulator of life. To maintain fullness and govern spirit, concentrate qi and embrace it—spirit abides where qi dwells, and when spirit and qi unite, one may attain longevity.\" The Three Mao Perfected Lords said: \"Qi is the elixir that adds years; the heart commands the spirit of qi. If one knows the master of circulating qi, one becomes an immortal.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the Twelve Towers?\n**Answer:** They are the twelve joints of the human throat.\n\n**Question:** What are the curtain and screen?\n**Answer:** They are the eyes. When practicing inner work, one contains the light within the cloud chamber—this is called \"closing the door and lowering the curtain,\" silently observing within.\n\n**Question:** What is *zi* and *wu*?\n**Answer:** *Zi* and *wu* are the center of Heaven and Earth. In Heaven, they are the sun and moon; in humans, they are the heart and kidneys; in time, they are *zi* and *wu*; in the hexagrams, they are *Kan* and *Li*; in direction, they are north and south.\n\n**Question:** What does it mean that the five positions interact and each has its correspondence?\n**Answer:** The number of Heaven and Earth is fifty-five. Thus, *Qian* takes one, nine combines to make ten; *Kun* takes four, six combines to make ten; *Xun* and *Dui* take two, eight combines to make ten; *Zhen* and *Gen* take three, seven combines to make ten; *Li* takes five, *Kan* takes ten—*Kan* and *Li* have no pair, so they unite themselves. In terms of numbers, this is the central number of Heaven and Earth; in terms of lines, it is the central line of Heaven and Earth; in terms of position, it is the central place of Heaven and Earth. *Kan* and *Li* are the agents—how could their use not be great?\n\n**Question:** What are the Five Peaks?\n**Answer:** The *True Forms of the Five Peaks* states: \"They are in the human head.\" Purple Clarity refers to the line, \"With a kerchief, one conceals the Five Peaks crown.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the Mysterious Female?\n**Answer:** Above is called *xuan* (mysterious); below is called *pin* (female). The Mysterious Pass is a single aperture—on the left it is called *xuan*, on the right *pin*.\n\n**Question:** What is the Gate of the Mysterious Female?\n**Answer:** The nose connects to celestial qi—this is the *xuan* gate. The mouth connects to earthly qi—this is the *pin* door. Nose and mouth are the gates and doors of the Mysterious Female.\n\n**Question:** What are the Three Sons and Three Daughters?\n**Answer:** The Dao of *Qian* seeks *Kun*—the eldest son is *Zhen*, the middle son is *Kan*, the youngest son is *Gen*. The Dao of *Kun* seeks *Qian*—the eldest daughter is *Xun*, the middle daughter is *Li*, the youngest daughter is *Dui*.\n\n**Question:** What are the Fire Dragon and Water Tiger?\n**Answer:** The tiger is the metal of the west. Metal generates water, yet conceals its form within water. The dragon is the wood of the east. Wood generates fire, yet is restrained by fire. The Perfected Lord of Venus said: \"The Five Phases do not proceed in order—the tiger is born within water. When the Five Phases are inverted, the dragon emerges from within fire.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the solstices and equinoxes?\n**Answer:** The *zi* hour corresponds to the winter solstice, when yin reaches its extreme and yang is born; the *wu* hour corresponds to the summer solstice, when yang reaches its extreme and yin is born; the *mao* hour corresponds to the spring equinox, when yang contains yin; the *you* hour corresponds to the autumn equinox, when yin contains yang. The human body also has solstices and equinoxes. Master Purple Yang said: \"Divide the body and heart into the upper and lower arcs; distinguish the winter and summer solstices by spirit and qi.\"\n\n**Question:** What is bathing?\n**Answer:** When true qi steams and divine water irrigates, this is bathing. The Most High said: \"Wash with sweet springs, cleanse away filth and grime. It issues from the Flowery Pond and later returns to the *Kun* door.\" Apricot Grove said: \"Bathing relies on divine water—this is it.\"\n\n**Question:** What is drawing and adding?\n**Answer:** After drawing lead from behind the elbow, one must add mercury to the central yellow. The *Anthology of Transmitted Dao* said: \"When it is time to draw, one must not fail to add.\"\n\n**Question:** What is transporting?\n**Answer:** Transport the golden essence from behind the elbow, move the jade fluid to the Mud Pill Palace—this is the foundational work, and the oral instructions are preserved therein.\n\n**Question:** What are the Three Fields?\n**Answer:** The brain is the Upper Field, the heart is the Middle Field, and the Sea of Qi is the Lower Field. If one obtains the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle to revolve them, then the upper and lower circulate like the flow of the Celestial River.\n\n**Question:** What are the Three Passes behind the back?\n**Answer:** Behind the brain is the Jade Pillow Pass; along the spine is the Narrow Pass; at the junction of water and fire is the Tail Gate Pass.\n\n**Question:** What is the Spirit Chamber?\n**Answer:** It is the chamber where the original spirit resides. Master Langran said: \"Before understanding the Spirit Chamber, a thousand disturbances arise; once the Heart Field is enlightened, ten thousand affairs become idle.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown?\n**Answer:** Spirit, qi, and essence merge into one. The Mysterious Pass is a single aperture—it is the culmination of spirit, qi, and essence.\n\n**Question:** What is the Five Qi Returning to the Origin?\n**Answer:** The true qi of the five viscera ascends to pay homage to the Celestial Origin.\n\n**Question:** What is the Harmonizing and Uniting of the Four Images?\n**Answer:** When the eyes do not see, the hun-soul resides in the liver; when the ears do not hear, the essence resides in the kidneys; when the tongue does not move, the spirit resides in the heart; when the nose does not smell, the po-soul resides in the lungs. Spirit, essence, hun-soul, and po-soul gather in the earth of intent.\n\n**Question:** What are Horse Teeth, True Master, Spirit Talisman, and White Snow?\n**Answer:** All are general names for lead and mercury.\n\n**Question:** What is the River Chariot?\n**Answer:** The correct qi of the north is called the River Chariot. On the left is the Sun Hub, on the right is the Moon Hub. It carries the correct qi, transports and stores the original yang, follows the seasons in its movement—all foundational work relies on the power of this chariot.\n\n**Question:** What are old and tender?\n**Answer:** When gathering the medicine, one must discern its oldness or tenderness. Peng Helin said: \"When tender, gather it; when old, it withers.\" Master Purple Yang said: \"When lead sees *gui* born, gather it swiftly; when gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\"\n\n**Question:** What are floating and sinking?\n**Answer:** Lead floats while silver sinks.\n\n**Question:** What are clear and turbid?\n**Answer:** Yang is clear and yin is turbid. The clear floats above, the turbid sinks below. In cultivating the elixir, one retains the clear and discards the turbid—for the clear belongs to yang and the turbid to yin.",

      "translated_text": "**Question:** What is the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases?\n**Answer:** The *Jinbi Jing* states: \"Metal and Wood overcome each other, Water and Fire restrain each other. When Earth flourishes in Metal’s domain, the Three Agents perish, and the Four Seas press in—only then is great peace achieved. This is all due to the power of Earth, the virtue of the Central Palace.\"\n\n**Question:** What is \"coming and going\"?\n**Answer:** \"From *zi* it goes, to *wu* it comes.\" The fire of the Yang tally advances from *zi* to *chen* and *si*; the tally of Yin retreats from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. Beginning in *fu* and ending in *kun*, all is governed by the trigrams. One wanes as the other waxes, one goes as the other comes—thus transformation is accomplished. As the *Yijing* says: \"Closing the door is called *kun*; opening the door is called *qian*. One closing and one opening is called change; ceaseless coming and going is called penetration.\"\n\n**Question:** What are female and male?\n**Answer:** The female is Yin, the male is Yang. \"One Yin and one Yang is called the Dao; solitary Yin or solitary Yang cannot generate on their own.\" The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Male and female intermingle, seeking their kind.\" The commentary says: \"The male is golden cinnabar; the female is fiery mercury. They mutually require and exhale, gathering by kind to generate and form the divine medicine.\"\n\n**Question:** How does one guard against danger?\n**Answer:** Guard against errors in the fire timing and shun confusion in dreams and waking. Master Cuixu said: \"Essence arises at its appointed time; when the time comes, the spirit knows. Within the hundred divisions of the day, one must never be confused.\"\n\n**Question:** What is union?\n**Answer:** Like a lodestone drawing iron, they connect though separated by barriers.\n\n**Question:** What are \"having\" and \"lacking\"?\n**Answer:** The *Jinbi Jing* says: \"Having and lacking mutually restrain; above dwells the Azure Dragon. The Two Lackings stem from One Having—its numinous transformations are wondrous and hard to fathom.\"\n\n**Question:** What are punishment and virtue?\n**Answer:** Yang is virtue; when virtue emerges, the myriad things live. Yin is punishment; when punishment emerges, the myriad things die. Thus, in the second month, Yang contains Yin, and the elm’s pods fall—this images golden cinnabar following Yin’s movements, falling into the womb, hence called \"returning to the root.\" In the eighth month, Yin contains Yang, and the shepherd’s purse sprouts—this images Metal and Water following Yang’s nurturing fluids within the crucible. Therefore, *mao* and *you* are where punishment and virtue contend, Yin and Yang balance, and the tally fire rests.\n\n**Question:** What are black and white?\n**Answer:** The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Know the white, guard the black, and the numinous brightness will come of itself.\" The white is Metal; the black is Water. Taking the root of Metal and Water as the foundation of the medicine.\n\n**Question:** What are cold and heat?\n**Answer:** Master Zhenyi said: \"Do not rely on the clepsydra’s marks; when wind and rain are unregulated, drought and flood contend. Either the Yang fire exceeds its measure, or the Yin tally loses its rhythm. Deep winter turns to scorching summer; high summer reverses to thick frost. If the fire timing errs, the numinous mercury flees—those who tend the fire must be cautious.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the dark and new moons?\n**Answer:** The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Between the dark and new moons, the tally aligns with the central path—this is when Metal and Water tally unite.\"\n\n**Question:** What is sealing and securing?\n**Answer:** The Perfected of Taibai said: \"Seal the embryo to prevent leakage; transformation occurs in an instant.\" This means that when Water and Fire achieve balance, the divine chamber must be closed tightly to prevent any escape.\n\n**Question:** What is the sacred embryo?\n**Answer:** From formlessness arises form, coalescing into the sacred embryo. Guard and nurture it diligently—ten months like tending an infant. When a woman first conceives, it resembles a young dragon just beginning to nurture its pearl. For the spirit and qi have only just congealed, and carelessness can easily lead to loss.\n\n**Question:** What are the Four Cardinal Points?\n**Answer:** *Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* are the Four Cardinal Points. The Mysterious Pass is the single aperture, the palace of the Four Cardinals.\n\n**Question:** Where is the Yellow Court located?\n**Answer:** Above the bladder, below the spleen, before the kidneys, to the left of the liver, and to the right of the lungs.\n\n**Question:** What are the Golden Crow and Jade Hare?\n**Answer:** The crow in the sun corresponds to the fluid in the heart; the hare in the moon corresponds to the qi in the kidneys.\n\n**Question:** What is refining the form?\n**Answer:** Refine the form to transform qi, refine qi to transform spirit, refine spirit to merge with the Dao. The Master of the Golden Grotto said: \"Refining the form with essence is no ordinary cinnabar or stone.\"\n\n**Question:** Master Ziyang said the heart and kidneys are not *kan* and *li*—why?\n**Answer:** The heart and kidneys are merely the substance of *kan* and *li*; they have both substance and function.\n\n**Question:** What is their function?\n**Answer:** The Heavenly Heart is the function of the heart, belonging to *li*. The form is the function of the kidneys, belonging to *kan*. At the moment of union, these are what one employs.\n\n**Question:** What is the work?\n**Answer:** Knowing the time to unite, advancing the fire while guarding against danger, engaging in \"wild battle\" when Yang arises, bathing with punishment and virtue—all to warmly nurture and complete the elixir.\n\n**Question:** What is \"wild battle\"?\n**Answer:** The *Longhu Jing* says: \"Civil means embrace gentleness; martial means suppress rebellion.\" Master Ziyang said: \"Defending the city and waging wild battle reveal fortune and misfortune—only then does the numinous cinnabar fill the crucible red.\"\n\n**Question:** What is warm nurturing?\n**Answer:** Master Xinglin said: \"Warm nurturing resembles the cycle of the stars.\" Master Piling said: \"Keep the golden crucible always warm with broth; do not let the jade furnace grow cold with fire.\"\n\n**Question:** What is refining and smelting?\n**Answer:** Refining the golden crucible, smelting the jade furnace—here lies the oral transmission.\n\n**Question:** What are reward and punishment?\n**Answer:** The arising of spring’s qi is called reward—this is the Yang fire’s time before *si*. The killing of autumn’s qi is called punishment—this is the Yin tally’s time after *wu*.\n\n**Question:** What is defending the city?\n**Answer:** Embracing the origin and guarding the One, congealing spirit and gathering qi.\n\n**Question:** What are dikes and defenses?\n**Answer:** Driving out stray thoughts to focus the mind single-mindedly.\n\n**Question:** What is the \"divine hut\"?\n**Answer:** The nose, the gate through which spirit and qi enter and exit. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"Within the divine hut, cultivation must be pursued; breath enters the hut to reach the cinnabar field.\"\n\n**Question:** What is \"Taiyi containing the true\"?\n**Answer:** Guarding the true One in the Heavenly Valley, qi enters the Mysterious Origin—thus one attains the original Heavenly True.\n\n**Answer to the above:** \"The true Dao nurtures the spirit—if one can guard it, I reside at the gate of dead qi, and the withered bones of seven ancestors all gain life-breath.\"",
      "overlap_context": "d, it withers.\" Master Purple Yang said: \"When lead sees *gui* born, gather it swiftly; when gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\"\n\n**Question:** What are floating and sinking?\n**Answer:** Lead floats while silver sinks.\n\n**Question:** What are clear and turbid?\n**Answer:** Yang is clear and yin is turbid.

      "translated_text": "What gives me life is the Dao; what animates me is spirit. To guide spirit in guarding the Dao and nurture spirit with the Dao—this is the way.\n\n**Question:** What are the Three Worms?\n**Answer:** The *Zhonghuang Jing* states: The first is the upper worm, dwelling in the brain. The second is the middle worm, dwelling in the Hall of Light. The third is the lower worm, dwelling in the stomach and intestines. Their names are Peng Shan, Peng Zhi, and Peng Jiao. They despise one’s progress in the Dao and delight in one’s retreat from resolve. The Upper Field is the palace where the original spirit resides, yet people cannot open this gate. When the corpse-worms occupy it, the cycle of birth and death continues without end. If one can grasp the original spirit and settle it in its true palace, the corpse-worms will naturally perish, and the true breath will stabilize of itself. This is what is meant by \"when one aperture opens, all apertures open together; when the great gate is unblocked, all the bones become free\"—then the Heavenly True descends with its numinous power, and the spirit that is not spirit is thus made spirit.\n\n**Question:** What is \"embryonic breathing\"?\n**Answer:** If one can guard the true One, the breath comes and goes as if within the mother’s womb—this is called the Great Stabilization.\n\n**Question:** What is the \"Jade Pool within Kun\"?\n**Answer:** The mouth. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"The Jade Pool’s clear water irrigates the numinous root.\"\n\n**Question:** What is the \"bellows and key\"?\n**Answer:** The *chong* is the bellows bag, and the *yue* is the three-holed flute. It is also the device blacksmiths use to blow air. Laozi said: \"Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows and key?\" The *Shengjiang Lun* states: \"If one can emulate the function of Heaven and Earth’s bellows and key—opening, qi issues forth; closing, qi enters—issuing forth like the Earth’s qi ascending, entering like Heaven’s qi descending. With each ascent and descent, one may attain the same longevity as Heaven and Earth.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the \"Five Sprouts\"?\n**Answer:** They are the true qi of the five viscera. The *Zhonghuang Jing* says: \"If you can guard them, the Three Worms will depart, and you will behold the Five Sprouts and the Nine True Qi.\"\n\n**Question:** What are \"Zhun and Meng\"?\n**Answer:** The *Dao Shu* states: *Kan* is water. Its first transformation is the Water Marsh’s *Jie*; its second is the Water Thunder’s *Zhun*, with its line residing in *yin*. *Li* is fire. Its first transformation is the Fire Mountain’s *Lü*; its second is the Fire Wind’s *Ding*; its third is the Mountain Water’s *Meng*, with its line residing in *xu*. The regulation of water and fire lies in *yin* and *xu*, and the twelve hexagrams’ qi operate through *Zhun* and *Meng*.\n\n**Question:** What does it mean to \"gather the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon\"?\n**Answer:** It does not refer to the external sun and moon but to gathering the true fluid within the heart and the true qi within the kidneys.\n\n**Question:** What are the \"inner and outer Eight Trigrams\"?\n**Answer:** The head is *Qian*, the feet are *Kun*, the bladder is *Gen*, the gall is *Xun*, the kidneys are *Kan*, the heart is *Li*, the liver is *Zhen*, and the lungs are *Dui*.\n\n**Question:** What does it mean to \"await the proper time before beginning cultivation\"?\n**Answer:** There is the work of the hour and the work of the moment. Piling said: \"In refining the elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice—within the body, a yang naturally arises.\" Ma Ziran said: \"Do not choose the hour to distinguish *zi* and *wu*; within the hexagrams, separate *Qian* and *Kun*.\" These are the works of the moment.\n\n**Question:** What is the form of the Golden Elixir?\n**Answer:** Its shape is like a pellet, its color like a red tangerine. The *Baopuzi* says: \"Large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine, within it a fine flavor sweet as honey. The śramaṇa obtains it for meditation; the Daoist in yellow robes obtains it to transcend. Examine it, practice it, and Heaven and Earth are complete.\" The *Yuanshu Song* says: \"Have you not seen how a grain of Golden Elixir blazes red? Large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine. Each person’s portion is originally complete; every night the numinous light fills the chamber.\" For each person is fully endowed, each is originally complete—know that it is not a material thing. Master Lü said: \"The Returned Elixir is one’s original substance.\"\n\n**Question:** Where exactly is the \"Mysterious Pass\"?\n**Answer:** It is in the human head. The work is easy, but the starting point is hard to find. Without a true teacher’s transmission through the crown, all efforts are in vain.\n\n**Question:** What is \"true emptiness\"?\n**Answer:** Returning to the origin and restoring the primordial is true emptiness. Yaolin said: \"Not knowing the marvelous elixir formula, one spends the whole day eating true emptiness.\"\n\n**Question:** What is \"application\"?\n**Answer:** Like the wasp adopting the larva, transmitting essence and conveying spirit.\n\n**Question:** What is \"spirit emergence\"?\n**Answer:** If one can guard the true One, the true blackness congeals of itself, and the yang spirit gathers of itself. For with the one heart, one moves all qi; when qi abides, spirit abides. Through long accumulation of true force, when the work is complete and conduct perfected, one then regulates the spirit to exit the shell.\n\n**Question:** What is \"transcendence\"?\n**Answer:** *Chao* means to exit—this is the emergence of spirit. *Tuo* means to shed the mortal frame—all depart through the Heavenly Gate. The ancient sages had verifications of shedding the shell: the Sixth Patriarch emerged from a seven-tiered pagoda, Zhong and Lü emerged from a three-story red tower, and Lord Haichan soared out through the Heavenly Gate on a crane. A poem says:\n*When the work is complete, you must exit the capital of spirit;*\n*The inner court’s splendor must not burden your body.*\n*Master the Five Immortals’ method of transcendence,*\n*Refine the immortal substance and leave the mortal dust.*\n\n**Question:** What is \"liberation through the corpse\"?\n**Answer:** There are five kinds of liberation through the corpse: gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. There are also those who accumulate merit and amass conduct to ascend in broad daylight. At the end of Emperor Huizong’s *Zun Dao Pian*, it is written: \"From ancient times to the present, those who have ascended in flight number over a thousand, and those who have raised their households number over eighty.\" From the *Zhen Gao*.\n\n**Question:** Is the Way of the Golden Elixir not also difficult?\n**Answer:** It is not difficult. Master Ziyang said: \"For the awakened, it is only simple and easy; for the deluded, it grows ever more complex and hard.\" Yaolin said: \"The words of simplicity take no more than half a sentence; the verification of efficacy lies in a single moment.\" Cuixu said: \"The medicine is not far, nor is its gathering difficult.\" Piling said: \"The supreme Dao is not complex—people merely obscure it.\" Ziqing said: \"A single word threads through ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures; but a moment’s work brings boundless ease and joy.\" The Master said: \"The initial work is easy; the difficulty lies in steadfastly guarding the Dao.\"",
      "overlap_context": "t. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"Within the divine hut, cultivation must be pursued; breath enters the hut to reach the cinnabar field.\"\n\n**Question:** What is \"Taiyi containing the true\"?\n**Answer:** Guarding the true One in the Heavenly Valley, qi enters the Mysterious Origin—thus one attains the original Heavenly True.\n\n**Answer to the above:** \"The true Dao nurtures the spirit—if one can guard it, I reside at the gate of dead qi, and the withered bones of seven ancestors all gain life-breath.\"",

      "translated_text": "**The Song of Delighting in the Dao**\n*Composed by Zixu Liaozhenzi Xiao Tingzhi Yuanrui*\n\nAbandoning delusion to return to truth, hidden amidst worldly dust,\nRefining lead, simmering mercury—coalescing the returning elixir.\nMen of this age scorn the Way of long life,\nTheir hearts ensnared by sound and form, lost in dreams.\n\nLiaozhenzi delights in the Dao,\nMarvelous indeed—turning the heart early.\nFleeting fame, fleeting gain—all empty splendor,\nIn this world, only cultivating truth is good.\n\nSpeak of cultivating truth—many do,\nYet none grasp its inner or outer workings.\nBy chance, on Elixir Mountain, I met a perfected one,\nA single word from him shattered all my doubts.\n\nReturning with the formula, I tested its refinement:\nDragon and tiger clashed in but a moment.\nClouds gathered, rain dispersed—all sounds stilled,\nYet through the night, wind and rain shook ten thousand peaks.\n\nClearing land, cutting thatch to build the spirit-chamber,\nSealing the pass, cutting off the vulgar and the foul.\nMotionless in the thatched hut, guarding the One,\nThe jade furnace tended, its fire never idle.\n\nFrom now on, I trample the gate of life and death,\nLeap free from the demon’s pass.\nOn Kunlun’s summit, I may come and go,\nAt times leading the primordial spirit forth and back again.\n\nDelighting in the Dao, refining the golden elixir,\nThe five qi harmonized, the jade cavern vast.\nClapping hands, I laugh and blow the flute without holes,\nTossing the mysterious pearl through nine bends.\n\nWhen lead-dragon and mercury-tiger mate,\nIn an instant, flames soar, scorching the heavens.\nRegulating the fire’s work demands care,\nNeither rigid nor yielding—neither civil nor martial—restrain the will.\n\nMorning and evening, hexagrams *Tun* and *Meng* hold sovereign and minister,\nKnowing sufficiency, ever sufficient, return to the root.\nAdvance must be brief, retreat must be long,\nSpring, summer, autumn, winter—follow the sequence.\n\nThe twenty-eight constellations gather in one crucible,\nWater and fire must distinguish front and rear ranks.\nHexagrams *Fu* and *Lin* require gentle nurturing,\nWhile *Guan* and *Yu* demand withdrawal for bathing.\n\nThe work of return enters the *Kun* palace,\nRefined into something firm and solid as a single mass.\nSuch skill emerges from the master’s hand—\nI ask those of this age: do you comprehend?\n\nLiaozhenzi delights in the Dao,\nMarvelous indeed—turning the heart early.\nWith soiled face and disheveled hair, as it pleases,\nIn solitude, no one disturbs my peace.\n\nThirst quenched with golden and jade nectars,\nHunger sated with intersecting pears and fiery jujubes.\nThe twin wheels of sun and moon drift west and east,\nGazing upward, I fathom the workings of creation.\n\nThe west, *Dui*’s metal, belongs to *You*,\nThe east, *Zhen*’s wood, belongs to *Mao*.\nThe numinous terrace gleams, untended by men,\nThe mysterious altar stands silent, unswept.\n\nRefining essence into qi, qi into spirit,\nYet the greatest treasure is essence and spirit as one.\nMetal and wood naturally converge,\nWater fears excess, fire fears dryness.\n\nLike a dragon nurturing its pearl, ever watchful,\nLike a hen brooding her eggs, ever embracing.\nThe golden liquid returning elixir lies before your eyes—\nMany are lost, few awaken.\n\nSome refine and consume it day and night,\nIts flavor surpassing fine wine—truly exquisite.\nAsk me of my present practice:\nIt does not depart from the true aperture at the crown.\n\nEmerging from the void’s misty expanse,\nPrior to heaven, prior to earth—this is the great Dao.\nIf disciples awaken to the great returning elixir,\nWithin this song, seek its subtleties.\n\nShould I mislead disciples by even a hair’s breadth,\nTen thousand kalpas of wind and blade await my trial.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of Contentment in the Thatched Hut**\n\nA thatched hut, seven feet high,\nNine feet wide when laid crosswise.\nOne carefree master dwells within,\nDreading guests who bring disturbance.\n\nHungry, a few plain rice grains suffice,\nWeary, sleep comes with clothes still on.\nFor love of this tranquility,\nAll affairs are cast aside.\n\nNightly by Qujiang’s bend,\nI scoop water to toy with the bright moon.\nWith both feet upturned, inverting the Dipper,\nI settle my breath, concentrate my spirit, and enter the qi’s fullness.\n\nJade nectar, brewed, descends from heaven,\nFlowing over my tongue, sweet as honey.\nNine cups drunk, then nine more,\nNow clear, now rich—I sip at leisure.\n\nThis realm—how wondrous, how rare!\nDrunk, I embrace Yang Fei in shared delight.\nWithin this body, husband and wife reside,\nMother and child in one form, vivid and alive.\n\nLike a dragon nurturing its pearl, never forgetting,\nLike a hen brooding her eggs, qi unbroken.\nAs the cold cicada sips the dawn breeze,\nAs the old oyster holds the autumn moon.\n\nDrunk, I sing aloud, shouting once—\nThe void shatters like autumn’s finest hair.\nTruly content—few understand,\nVague and indistinct, as if mad.\n\nGazing upward, I marvel at creation’s work:\nThe sun returns eastward, the moon still west.\nSeizing the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit,\nOne floats, one sinks—the pearl takes flight.\n\nSilently moving heaven and earth through *Pi* and *Tai*,\n*Tun* and *Meng*’s ebb and flow—advance and retreat.\nMetal and wood naturally resolve their union,\nMutual generation and conquest hold subtle mysteries.\n\nBefore the furnace, apply the firing regimen—restrain the will,\nThe divine water’s bathing demands caution against peril.\nIn a year’s twelve months,\nWood’s liquid and metal’s essence shun the hare and cock.\n\nIn the tenth month, the embryo is shed, swallowed into the belly,\nThe ninefold work completed in an instant.\nDo not treat the fire’s timing as child’s play—\nWith immortals, ponder it carefully.\n\nIf the return deviates by even a hair’s breadth,\nMercury flees, lead scatters—they fail to unite.\nDisciples, in this, reflect deeply:\nFrom seven sevens comes forty-eight.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, the numbers do not escape,\nThis is the most profound oral formula.\nIf the Silver River meets the Dipper and Ox,\nSeal the furnace tightly—do not leak lightly.\n\nDo not let gods or ghosts witness the work’s beginning,\nSimmering the jade furnace into white snow.\nMercury was originally the black turtle’s liver,\nCinnabar is the red phoenix’s blood.\n\nThere is civil and martial, rigid and yielding,\nAdvance and retreat, coming and going—distinguish them finely.\nNurturing the infant, waging wild battle,\nThe work within the moment must be spoken.\n\nTruly content—few understand,\nIn the thatched hut’s wild seclusion, few tread.\nWith soiled face and disheveled hair, delighting in the Dao,\nLike a fish drinking water—only I know.\n\nAmid clouds, drinking alone, toasting in rounds,\nBeneath pines, reciting poems without rhyme.\nOn the five peaks, autumn high, white phoenixes soar,\nIn the nine springs, spring warm, black turtles nurture.\n\nMy own yang spirit leaps exultantly,\nWhile yin ghosts darkly grieve.\nPrimordial essence, endlessly refined,\nJade nectar, ever consumed—never apart.\n\nMy family’s livelihood differs in its work,\nNot to be spoken of to ordinary men.\nFew understand—truly content,\nHaving grasped heaven’s mechanism, ever as if drunk.",

      "translated_text": "Drunk, I pluck a stringless zither,\nEach note within its sound instructs my child in detail.\nExhort the worthy, shun the base and greedy,\nHasten to seek a master, grasp the subtle pointer—\nIf in this life you fail to awaken to true cultivation,\nNext life may not grant such fortune again.\nTurn back, seize the Purple Gold Elixir,\nRefine it, and you ascend as an immortal.\n\n**Sword Song**\nTwo branches of wisdom-swords buried in true earth,\nDrawn from their sheaths, they roar like storm and rain.\nWithout these tools for elixir-refining,\nA thousand scholars, ten thousand will err.\nOnly the meticulous grasp the sword’s secret,\nWielding its essence, they move through the ages.\nKnowing the time, they soar into the Great Empyrean,\nClearly finding the path of yin and yang.\nSeizing the Jade Hare, it dares not move,\nWithin the furnace, cinnabar finds its place.\nDiscern its age, judge its floating and sinking,\nAdvance and retreat, distinguish host and guest.\nIn an instant, flames soar to scorch the heavens,\nForging the mysterious essence—subtle, hard to perceive.\nThough its cries seem mournful and bitter,\nIt clings ever fondly to its nurturing mother.\nTo subdue the fiery dragon-child,\nGo north to seek the watery tiger.\nDragon meets tiger, they coil and entwine,\nVaguely, dimly, forming a single mass.\nThe River Chariot bears it to Kunlun’s peak,\nSealed in the earthen crucible, the gate unopened.\nBreath upon breath, unbroken as silk,\nEmbrace the One, guard unity with utmost focus.\nJade nectar ferments, descending from heaven,\nFragrant and sweet, it suffuses the tongue’s tip.\nRefine it, consume it, let it enter the five viscera—\nThis alone is called the Great Return Elixir.\nChronic ailments vanish, spirit and qi refreshed,\nFour limbs harmonized, the body sound and serene.\nTrue fire has always arisen from wood,\nBut without skill in tempering, do not force the drill.\nThe jade furnace’s fire and timing must be gauged—\nFire fears cold, water fears drought.\nIf you obtain the true sword-secret from a master,\nHow could cultivation be difficult?\nFrom iron cliffs and hanging walls, lingering snow,\nIn the jade casket’s depths, the old dragon coils.\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water polishes it to brilliance,\nKnowing the time, lift and pluck it at will.\nShould you encounter the solemn and stern, report swiftly,\nFor heterodox demons will tremble in dread.\nBreaking the Primordial Chaos, chiseling the Undifferentiated,\nYou ensure its coming and going without flaw.\nFocus the mind, steady the will—no need for haste,\nLeft and right, wield it with measured grace.\nThis song I leave for those who meet the sword,\nPonder it deeply, and it may serve as your guide.\n\n**Farewell Song to Hermit Chen, Departing for Mount Wuyi**\nKnocking at my gate, you bid me farewell,\nI open the door, cherishing but a moment’s pause.\nThe Dao resides within—seek it not without,\nWandering ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains is vain.\nListen now, let me speak—\nFew words, yet the true marvelous secret:\nWhen the dragon sings and the tiger roars in the deep night,\nSwiftly drive the River Chariot without pause,\nIn an instant, bear it to the Mud Pill Palace’s peak,\nAdvance the fire in the jade furnace, smelting like snow.\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water, limpid and clear,\nIrrigates the yellow sprout in due season.\nJade nectar, ambrosia—swallow it often,\nThe four limbs steam, the complexion transformed.\nSide doors and minor methods number in the thousands,\nBut only this Dao is most direct.\nWithout, it is neither cinnabar nor sulfur,\nWithin, it is neither essence nor blood.\nRound, it rolls over land, ever companion,\nCrimson, glistening, radiant and pure.\nKnowing the time, gather it when it comes,\nSeal the divine furnace, guard it well.\nNine returns, seven reversals—an instant’s work,\nThe sacred bellows blow, aided by the dawn wind.\nTo recognize the Mysterious Pass’s true location,\nThe laughing child points to the highest peak.\nThe highest peak, fair and wondrous,\nOn its far shore, misty purple mushrooms sprout.\nThis alone is the herb of immortality,\nYet countless cultivators remain unaware.\nI dash off these few lines, spilling heaven’s mechanism—\nYou strap on your straw sandals and depart,\nBut when, after all, will you return?\nI send word to the immortals: do not speculate,\nWait until my work is complete,\nThen I shall surely come to Wuyi, bones transformed.\n\n**Song for Mount Zou’s Peak**\nYou and I unravel the diagrams and texts,\nGrasping at emptiness—what form does it take?\nThe mechanism lies in the heart, skill in the hand,\nFrom nothing, something is born.\nThe perfected one wields the twin swords—\nMale and female, they soar through the great void,\nWielding thunder and lightning.\nAt midnight, when they roar,\nThey point and shatter the faces of yin demons.\nSeizing the luminous pearl, they return,\nNot to be shown to ordinary men.\nA single clash settles great peace,\nThe Primordial Lord sits enthroned in the Three Clarities’ hall.\nThe delicate maiden weds the Golden Duke,\nIn the bridal chamber’s depths, clouds and rain thicken.\nThe fair-faced young lord rides the white tiger,\nThe green-clad maiden straddles the green dragon.\nBy the Cowherd and Weaver’s river, they meet,\nThen lock the gate within the Central Palace.",

ripeness or tenderness.\n\n**Nine**\nThe art of fire-tempering is no small skill—\na hair’s breadth misstep brings vast difference.\nIf the crucible’s mercury flees and black lead takes flight,\nfrom this moment your resolve may falter.\n\nSeek a true master’s counsel in detail,\nlest reckless action lead you astray.\nSubtle and profound, the deepest mechanism—\neven in speech, restraint is required.\n\n**Ten**\nAt the Nine-Bend River’s head, against the raging waves,\nin an instant you surge past the heart of heaven.\nAtop Kunlun’s peak, the waters settle clear—\nfermented, the nectar of jade is yours to drink.\n\nNow is the time to gather and refine,\nthe River Chariot’s movement never ceasing.\nYin and yang, black and white, rise and sink—\nlock the Jade Gate fast, secure and firm.\n\n**Eleven**\nThe medicine arises in the southwest, in the earth of Kun,\nthe golden elixir’s root lies solely here.\nLet the seeker ponder deeply, trace its mystery—\nno marvel surpasses the true seed.\n\nOnce this is accomplished, all ten thousand things are complete;\nno need to divide east, west, south, or north.\nClinging to texts and rigid forms—how can one penetrate?\nLike a mute describing dreams.\n\n**Twelve**\nThe Great Dao of golden liquid and returning elixir,\npassed down once in ten thousand kalpas by the ancients.\nWith whole heart they laid bare its secrets,\nguiding others to transcend and reach the Dao’s shore.\n\nDo not blame the leaking of heaven’s mechanism—\nbeyond this mystery, there is no deeper mystery.\nHanded down through ten thousand generations to the

water,\nrefine, simmer, and delve deeper into its principles.\nAdvance and retreat, withdraw and add—nine revolutions,\nfloating and sinking—\ntempering the hidden dragon, *Fu* and *Lin* return.\n\nThe marvelous work follows the heart of heaven,\nentrusted to the Yellow Dame to pair *Bing* and *Ren*.\nFermented, the brew descends from the mountain’s peak—\ndrink often,\nslowly pluck

*qi*—\nthe precelestial *qi* is the primordial unity of heaven’s *qi*, infused above the celestial pivot;\nthe postcelestial *qi* is the primordial unity of earth’s *qi*, infused below the terrestrial pivot.\nShould one grasp the turning mechanism of the Dipper’s handle,\nthen ascent and descent, coming and going, will cycle endlessly,\nmoving in harmony with heaven’s revolutions.\n\nMaster Yuanhe observes: “The human body, in its essence, mirrors heaven and earth.”\nOne who attains this state remains ever as if intoxicated.\nWhen one masters the Dipper’s handle to regulate the *qi* of yin and yang,\nthen in a trance of indistinct obscurity—vague, dim, and profound—\nbody and mind naturally harmonize and expand,\nas if entranced or drunk,\nthe skin suffused with refreshing clarity,\nbeauty dwelling within.\n\nThe sun has its conjunctions, the moon has its conjunctions.\nThe moon, dependent on the sun for its illumination,\nafter the dark-new conjunction when the luminaries unite,\nthe lunar essence generates spirit, transforming yin with yang.\nThe moon’s dark phase mirrors the year’s end,\nits new phase mirrors the year’s beginning.\nFrom the new moon it receives the sun’s celestial tally,\nwater engendering silver;\nby the dark moon, yang *qi* is wholly spent—\nthen metal and water, these two substances,\nnaturally enfold one another in mutual embrace.\nAs the *Cantong Qi* states:\n“At the moon’s dark phase, they envelop one another,\nconcealed within their walled enclosure.”\nExhaust the cyclical earth phases, determine the metal and wood.\nThe Golden Elixir of Return cannot be wrought without earth;\none must thoroughly investigate true earth.\nAn ancient song says:\n“The Five Phases are present everywhere—\nwhere is true earth to be found?”\nMaster Ziyang’s verse:\n“If *li* and *kan* lack the cyclical earth phases,\nthough they contain the Four Images, the Elixir will not form.”\n\n*Geng* is the metal of the west;\n*jia* is the wood of the east.\nBetween these two, separated by distance,\nwood can only unite through the mediation of the Yellow Dame.\nMetal first generates water, wood first generates fire;\nwhen water and fire flourish,\nthen metal and wood naturally unite.\nMaster Liu’s *Song of Prior Images*:\n“Let *geng* be born, let *jia* be born—\nonly then is the Dao of birth for *geng* and *jia* made clear.”\nThe Western Flower Saint Mother declares:\n“To birth *jia* and birth *geng* is to become the ancestor of the Great Elixir.”\n\nTrue earth is the position of *kun*.\nAbove the Magpie Bridge, below the Magpie Bridge—\nhere Master Cui again points to the upper and lower two sources.\nThe Magpie Bridge is the Celestial River.\nWhen one’s practice mirrors the Celestial River’s ceaseless flow,\nabove and below become inexhaustible.\n\nHeaven responds to the stars, earth responds to the tides.\nIn heaven, it responds to the stars, like the Dipper’s handle turning in the sky;\non earth, it responds to the tides, like the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.\nAs the *Song of the Pivotal Axis* says:\n“The tide beneath the earth, the moon above the heavens.”\n\nRouse the *xun* wind, move the *kun* fire.\nRest is wind;\nfire cannot flame on its own—\nit must rely on wind to fan it.\nMaster Zhongli’s Elixir Instructions:\n“The medicine depends on the *xun* wind.”\nMaster Apricot Grove’s verse:\n“Blowing and breathing rely on the *xun* wind.”\nMovement is action.\n*Kun* is the southwest, the source where water and fire converge.\n\nEnter the Yellow Chamber, form the supreme treasure.\nAfter the fire tally is activated,\nit is guided into the Yellow Chamber,\nwhere the supreme treasure coalesces.\nThe Yellow Chamber, also called the Yellow Flower or the Mysterious Pass—\na single aperture, the true earth, hence the Yellow Chamber.\n\nWater fears dryness, fire fears cold.\nIn refining the Golden Elixir,\nthe entire process depends on the fire’s regulation.\nWhen adding water, it tempers the fire’s aridity;\nwhen moving the fire, one must guard against its chill.\nThus water fears both excess and dryness,\nfire fears both aridity and cold.\nThere are measures and methods—\none must regulate them evenly,\nensuring neither excess nor deficiency.\n\nDeviate by a hair’s breadth, and the Elixir will not form.\nWhen moving the fire, adjust with meticulous care—\nthe slightest misstep severs heaven from earth.\nMaster Ziyang’s verse:\n“A hair’s breadth of deviation, and the Elixir will not form.”\n\nLead-dragon ascends, mercury-tiger descends.\nLead is fire, the dragon—\nsinking and dwelling below.\nMercury is water, the tiger—\nfloating and dwelling above.\nThe Perfected One of Great White’s song:\n“When the Five Phases do not proceed in order,\nthe tiger is born within water;\nwhen the Five Phases are inverted,\nthe dragon emerges from within fire.”\nThrough methodical regulation, they naturally ascend and descend.\n\nDrive the two substances, do not let them stray.\nWhen dragon and tiger ascend and descend,\none must grasp and guide them, never allowing them to wander.\n\nBorn in *kun*, planted in *qian*—\nthe medicine is born in the southwest, the domain of *kun*;\nborn in the earth of *kun*, it is then transplanted to the palace of *qian*.\nThe principle of the upper and lower two sources is thus made clear.\n\nOnly with

      "translated_text": "True One Master said: Utmost sincerity in refining this medicine is the Way of ascending in broad daylight. Master Yin the True said: Without attaining the proper ground, do not act recklessly. One must conceal, guard, and protect it with care, preserving the celestial and terrestrial mechanism. To steal from Heaven and Earth, to seize the transformations of Creation—all refinement steals the mechanism of Heaven and Earth, seizes the marvel of Creation’s transformations. In application, it accords with the *qian*-*kun* hexagrams of prosperity and decline; in extraction and addition, it mirrors the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.\n\nSet the water clock, divide the two crescents, separate midnight and noon, join yin and yang, connect the dark and new moons, unite dragon and tiger. Follow the great reckoning of Heaven and Earth, invoke the transformative mechanism of yin and yang. The *yin* tally and *yang* fire adhere to the hexagrams’ lines, cycling endlessly, circulating and interchanging without losing their timing. Within a single crucible, the transformations of Creation are manifest, mirroring Heaven and Earth’s movement in generating the myriad things. If the fire-timing is lost, extraction and addition exceed bounds, cold and heat fail to correspond, advance and retreat diverge—then how, within Heaven and Earth, could the myriad things be born? By what means would yin and yang’s *qi* generate dragon and tiger?\n\nBore through the Five Phases, meet the Eight Trigrams. The five directions take the center as their master; the Five Phases take earth as their master. Occupying the center with the virtue of earth’s dignity, thus water attains earth and conceals its form, fire attains earth and veils its brightness, metal attains earth and enhances its luster, wood attains earth and increases its moisture. Earth has no fixed form, yet it arranges the four images. When the Five Phases gather, the Eight Trigrams naturally converge.\n\nTrue water, true fire—within *li* there is yin, so the fluid within the heart is true water. Within *kan* there is yang, so the fire within the kidneys is true fire. These are the true water and fire of the body. When water and fire merge, one never ages. The earth’s vapor rises to become mist; the sky’s darkness descends to become dew. Yin and yang unite to form nourishing rain, which brings flourishing to the myriad things. Within the body, yin and yang merge to form true fluid, nourishing the five viscera and six bowels, then returning to the lower *dantian* to congeal as the elixir. Thus, without yin and yang, *qi* does not arise; without fluids, the five viscera and six bowels sicken.\n\nWater flows, fire flames—water is above and thus flows downward; fire dwells below and thus blazes upward. The *Cantong Qi* says: “Water flows but does not blaze upward; fire burns fiercely but does not moisten downward.” This is the meaning. Within the body, it can be verified. True water and true fire exist within the human body, and in the moment of refinement, they can be tested.\n\nThis is *xing* and *ming*, not spirit and *qi*. The left is *xing*, which belongs to *li*; the right is *ming*, which belongs to *kan*. The central yin of *kun* enters *qian* to form *li*; the central yang of *qian* enters *kun* to form *kan*. Know that *li* and *kan* are *xing* and *ming*, the essence of spirit and *qi*.\n\nThe lead of the water realm is but a single flavor—water is *kan*, lead is metal, also called the metal within water. The *Yunfang Elixir Formula* says: “Lead, lead of the water realm, numinous source of *geng* and *xin*, its chamber belongs to *qian*, it constantly dwells at *kan*’s gate, concealed at *dui*’s edge.” Liu Haichan’s poem says: “To refine the elixir, one must have the lead of the water realm—this single flavor is the root and stem of the returned elixir.”\n\nReturn to the root aperture, recover the root of *ming*. Having attained the upper and lower two sources, this is the aperture for returning to the root and recovering *ming*. Pierce the *weilü*, connect the *niwan*. Above, it connects to the *niwan* palace; below, it pierces the *weilü* gate, signifying the ceaseless circulation of a single *qi* between above and below.\n\nTrue key, true crucible and furnace—*The Treatise on Ascending and Descending* says: “If one can emulate Heaven and Earth’s use of the key, opening lets *qi* exit, closing lets *qi* enter. *Qi*’s exit resembles earth’s *qi* rising; *qi*’s entry resembles heaven’s *qi* descending. With a single *qi* circulating endlessly, one may attain the same longevity as Heaven and Earth.” The upper is called the golden crucible, the lower the jade furnace—yet both are the true transformations of the human body.\n\nWithin nonbeing there is being; within being there is nonbeing. *The Golden and Azure Scripture* says: “Being and nonbeing mutually restrain; above, the Azure Dragon resides. The two nonbeings honor the one being—its numinous transformations are wondrous and hard to fathom.” The *Cantong Qi* says: “Above closed is called being; below empty is called nonbeing. Nonbeing serves the above, where the spirit’s virtue resides. These two apertures’ method illustrates how being and nonbeing require each other.”\n\nEntrust the Yellow Dame, match the Maiden of Cinnabar—the Maiden of Cinnabar dwells in the *li* palace; the *kan* youth cannot unite with her without the Yellow Dame’s mediation. The Yellow Dame is *kun* earth. Gently, silently act. When advancing the fire, one should move gently and act silently. Master Xinglin’s poem says: “Quietly conduct the fire-timing, silently move the initial line.” This is the way.\n\nWithin a day, the twelve hours; within a year, use the months—one month’s 360 hours correspond to a year. Within a month, take the days—one day’s twelve hours correspond to a month. Within a day, use the hours; within an hour, use the quarters. At this level of subtlety, nothing is not oral instruction. Where intention reaches, all can be done. Within the twelve hours of a day, when a single yang stirs, one may begin. Master Ziyang said: “A moment’s effort contains a year’s seasonal timing.” This is the instantaneous celestial revolution. Ma Ziran’s poem says: “Without distinguishing midnight and noon within the hour, how can one separate *qian* and *kun* within the lines?”\n\nDrink the *daogui*, perceive Heaven’s artistry—flying swords are refined from earth and metal, hence “drinking the *daogui*.” The upper and lower two sources are both true earth. To perceive is to observe. *The Flourishing of the Yin Tally* says: “Observe Heaven’s Way, grasp Heaven’s movement—this is perfection.” Discern the new and full moons, know dusk and dawn.",

      "translated_text": "One may discern the new and full moons within the body. Dusk and dawn correspond to the two hexagrams *Zhun* (Morning Layering) and *Meng* (Evening Darkness). Distinguish floating and sinking, clarify host and guest—lead sinks while silver floats; lead is heavy and lies below, silver is light and rises above. Having discerned floating and sinking, one must clarify host and guest. Master Ziyang’s poem says: *“Though he be host, I remain guest.”* There is no other reason: this is the principle of first ascending, then descending. For union, let there be no separation. Water and fire must always unite; let them not be kept apart.\n\nWhen gathering the medicine, regulate the fire’s work. At the time of gathering the medicine, all depends on harmonizing the fire’s function. One firm, one yielding; one civil, one martial. Seal the gate at two and eight, secure with six and one. Follow the hexagram’s text, trace the clepsydra’s flow, divide the two crescents, separate midnight and noon—beginning with *Fu* (Return) and ending with *Kun* (Receptive). *The Kinship of the Three* says: *“Lead must be true lead, and fire must be true fire.”* How could one not carefully harmonize them to avoid excess or deficiency?\n\nReceiving qi is auspicious; guard against its turning inauspicious. Master Ziyang’s poem says: *“At first receiving qi, it comes easily; in drawing and adding fire, one must guard against danger.”* At the outset of receiving qi, metal and wood merge, water and fire share a realm—how joyous this seems! Yet when it sheds its form to return to *Kun*, one bathes it to prevent misfortune, guards the city to anticipate peril.\n\nWhen the fire’s work is complete, do not harm the elixir. When the nine revolutions of fire are fulfilled, cease the talismanic fire. Not knowing when to stop will surely cause the numinous mercury to fly away. Heaven and earth are wondrous, creation is strange—this speaks of their uncanny power, which must not be indulged.\n\nAt the initial formation of the embryo, observe one’s natal destiny. When the sacred embryo first forms, look to the moment of receiving qi—this is the natal destiny. At the final shedding of the embryo, observe the four cardinal directions. When the embryo is fully shed, observe the four cardinal palaces, which are the Mysterious Pass.\n\nProceed in secrecy, and every phrase will resonate. If one practices this with utmost care, every word will prove true. Master Lü’s poem says: *“Reading Cui’s *Mirror of Gathering Medicine* / Makes one’s heart-ground ever clearer.”*\n\n**Interpreting Master Chang’s *Spring in the Qin Garden*:**\nThe Seven-Return Elixir—fire generates two, completing the number seven. “Return” means ascending from below; “reversion” means descending from above. Some say wood (three) and metal (four) combine to make seven, hence “seven returns”—this explanation is also apt. For metal and wood are the parents of water and fire, the ancestors of the Five Phases, the root of the reverted elixir. To take snivel, spittle, saliva, essence, qi, blood, and fluid as the “seven returns” is utterly mistaken. Master Yunfang’s poem says: *“Seven yin substances— / If one takes these as the seed of the elixir, / How could one ascend to the Jade Capital?”* Master Ziyang’s scripture says: *“What use are these seven yin things?”*\n\nThe names of the reverted elixir are many: Great Elixir, Inner Elixir, Jade Flask Elixir, Crimson Snow Elixir, Radiant Cinnabar Elixir, Dragon-Tiger Supreme Medicine, Nine-Turn Spirit Elixir, Cosmic Lord Spirit Elixir, White Snow, Tortoise Essence, Phoenix Blood, Hare Marrow, Raven Liver, Primordial Qi of Heaven and Earth. Yet all are but the union of true lead and true mercury—never the coarse lead, mercury, minerals, plants, or material medicines. Mercury is the nine-turn true mercury; lead is the seven-return true lead. This single flavor is the true qi of heaven and earth, the purest essence of sun and moon. Externally, it mirrors the images of *Qian* and *Kun*; internally, it accords with the workings of creation. It gives life and brings death, becomes tiger and dragon, harbors affection and duty to act as husband and wife, binds ancestors and descendants to be called mother and child.\n\nOnce these two flavors are understood, their natures must be known. Through the matchmaker, male and female harmonize; through the mother, children and grandchildren grow. The sages’ deepest secret is profoundly mysterious—those who cultivate the elixir should seek it within themselves.\n\nFirst, one must refine the self and await the time. The Dao is not far from man; the common people use it daily yet do not know it. Refining the self is the way of refining the form. It is nothing less than splitting open primordial chaos, cleaving apart the undifferentiated, gathering the essence of the True One, embracing the radiance of the primordial, to lay the foundation of the elixir. One cannot use heterogenous elements for creation. Thus *The Kinship of the Three* says: *“Swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses. / Of the same kind, transformation comes easily; of different species, skill is hard to apply.”*\n\nThe Master of Golden Flower Grotto answered the Mount Taishi Hermit: *“Accumulate the yang hun, dissolve the yin po, and use the yang soldiers to repel the yin bandits. / The eight trigrams interact, the Five Phases overcome one another, returning to the root and recovering destiny—thus the elixir blazes forth. / Refine the form with essence, not with mere cinnabar or stone.”* Some take “refining the self” to mean “refining earth”—this explanation is also apt, for the medicine arises in the southwest, the region of *Kun*.\n\nThe essential is to know the time. If one misses the time, how can heaven and earth rely on seasonal nodes to generate the radiance of yin and yang? How can they give birth to dragon and tiger? The moments before and after the crescent moon are the transformations within the time; the union of *Kan* and *Li* is the work within the clepsydra’s flow. At this level of subtlety, nothing is not oral instruction.\n\nWhen the first yang stirs, the midnight clepsydra runs long. The cosmos is in your hands; the myriad transformations are in your body. The Master of Piling said: *“To refine the elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice— / Within the body, a yang naturally arises. / Within the time, there is the work of time; within the clepsydra’s flow, there is the work of the clepsydra.”*\n\nThe lead crucible is warm, its light piercing the curtain. The lead crucible is the crucible for creating lead. “Warm” refers to the fire’s strength—it must not be deficient, for only through gentle nurturing can the elixir form. The Master of Piling said: *“The golden crucible always holds warm water and fire; / The jade furnace must not be allowed to grow cold.”* The curtain refers to the eyes. Master Yunfang has the line: *“Leisurely lowering the curtain, silently observing.”* Where the work is applied, the spirit’s radiance shines brilliantly, penetrating the curtain.",
      "overlap_context": "ran’s poem says: “Without distinguishing midnight and noon within the hour, how can one separate *qian* and *kun* within the lines?”\n\nDrink the *daogui*, perceive Heaven’s artistry—flying swords are refined from earth and metal, hence “drinking the *daogui*.” The upper and lower two sources are both true earth. To perceive is to observe. *The Flourishing of the Yin Tally* says: “Observe Heaven’s Way, grasp Heaven’s movement—this is perfection.” Discern the new and full moons, know dusk and dawn.",

Thus, the water-tiger seizes the fire-dragon, and they intertwine in union. *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *“The lead-dragon ascends, the mercury-tiger descends; / Drive the two substances—do not let them flee.”* Should the firing be mistimed, dragon and tiger fail to unite, and lead and mercury scatter.\n\nMaster Ziyang’s verse reads:\n*“The white tiger of Western Mountain rages wild, / The azure dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood. / Seized in both hands to wrestle unto death, / They fuse into a mass of purple-golden frost.”*\nTo seize them in both hands is but to ensure their union, that they may congeal into treasure.\n\nThe firing work follows the Dipper’s perilous stars.\n\nNow, fire is the true essence of the Great Yang, named yet formless. Thus *The Kinship of the Three* says: *“Having obtained true lead, one still lacks true fire.”* How lightly could this be discussed? For fire arises within water—why? Kan belongs to water, and within Kan lies true yang, which is true fire.

The golden palace’s cinnabar and mercury fall into discord; the jade crucible breeds locusts in swarms. The metal-mother and wood-dragon seethe and boil; the Kan-man and Li-woman flee in haste.

      "translated_text": "When the Dipper aligns with *Niu* and *Dou*, it is the time to apply effort. At the winding river’s rise, the moon’s radiance gleams bright, and a crow takes flight—this is the small intestine, coiled ninefold in twelve bends, called the Winding River. The moon signifies the elixir’s function, its flawless, crystalline coldness marking it as the supreme treasure. The crow in flight embodies yin containing yang. As Liu Haichan’s verse says: *\"How oft it perches in the cassia boughs,\"* and again: *\"The crow flies, the hare unstartled.\"* An ancient poem echoes: *\"A crow flies into the hare’s palace,\"* all conveying this meaning. At that moment, one drinks the *daogui* oneself. When the work of union begins, one acts—gathering from the earthen crucible and imbibing it. Thus *The Mirror of Entering the Elixir* states: *\"Drink the daogui, know the earthen crucible—only then may one speak of the daogui’s subtlety.\"* And who would believe a child is nurtured from nothing? The Way of the Returned Elixir is nothing giving birth to something: gradually gathering, gradually refining, coalescing into the sacred embryo, form arising from formlessness, nurturing the infant. As Master Zi Qing’s poem says: *\"How many times the world’s affairs make one laugh— / A man, too, may conceive a child. / His own essence and blood unite in congress; / Within his body, husband and wife are wondrous indeed.\"*\n\nDiscern the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source. *The Scripture of Clarity and Stillness* states: *\"Heaven is clear, earth is turbid; man is clear, woman is turbid.\"* Clarity is the source of turbidity—nothing more, for yang is clear and yin is turbid. The light and clear float above: true mercury. The heavy and turbid sink below: true lead. These two serve distinct purposes—how could one not distinguish the Way of clarity and turbidity, ascent and descent?\n\nWood and metal stand apart. Wood dwells in the east, *jia-yi*, manifesting as the Azure Dragon, corresponding to the *Zhen* trigram. It is Qian’s eldest son, fire’s mother, metal’s wife—the green-robed maiden, the blue-eyed barbarian child, the Azure Dragon of the Eastern Sea, the essence of wood. Metal resides in the west, *geng-xin*, manifesting as the White Tiger, corresponding to the *Dui* trigram. It is Kun’s youngest daughter, water’s mother, wood’s husband—the white-garbed gentleman, the white-haired elder, the White Tiger of the Western Mountains, the essence of metal. Separated by *mao* and *you*, they cannot meet without the matchmaker’s aid. As Zi Yang says: *\"Wood and metal, sundered, cannot unite without cause; / They must rely on the matchmaker’s guidance.\"* Then wood gives birth to fire, metal to water; water and fire share a realm, and metal and wood merge. Without a teacher’s guidance, this remains obscure.\n\nThe great elixir of golden cinnabar has been passed down once in ten thousand kalpas. The jade bamboo’s sacred scrolls leave nine of ten scholars lost; the sage’s words are transmitted mouth to mouth, heart to heart across generations. Without heart-to-heart transmission and oral instruction, even the talents of the Three Heroes or the wisdom of the Ten Sages, no matter how many ways they ponder, will never begin the work or coalesce the sacred embryo. As the saying goes: *\"Though your wisdom surpass Yan and Min, / Without a wise teacher, do not guess in vain. / For the golden elixir has no oral formula— / Where then will you form the numinous embryo?\"* Liu Haichan’s verse declares: *\"This Way is utterly manifest, / Yet how can one grasp it through wild conjecture?\"* The Way of the Golden Elixir is truly difficult to know without a true teacher.\n\nThe Dao’s essentials are profound and subtle, its celestial mechanisms deep and distant. The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth. The Great Dao is passionless, moving the sun and moon. The Great Dao is nameless, nurturing the ten thousand things. I know not its name—reluctantly, I call it the Dao. Vast and obscure, within it lies essence; dim and indistinct, within it lies substance. Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, untouchable to grasp—from nothing, something arises. Its celestial mechanisms are deep and distant, its mysteries unfathomable. *The Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence* says: *\"Heaven harbors five thieves; to see them is to flourish. / To know and cultivate them is to be called a sage.\"* Without penetrating insight into yin and yang, deep understanding of creation’s workings, how could one cleave open the primordial chaos, gather the roots of heaven and earth’s parents as the foundation of the elixir; rend the vast expanse, extract the pure essence of yin and yang as the substance of the great elixir? Boring through the five phases, harmonizing the four images, the three flowers gather at the crown, ensuring the primal qi does not dim; the five qi ascend to the origin, ensuring the yang soul does not stray. Roaming freely in the boundless dark, traversing the indistinct and vague, one moves in and out, shifts and unites spirit and yang. When the work is complete and merit fulfilled, one attains the rank of celestial immortal.\n\nYet the Way of the Golden Liquor’s Returned Elixir has but one gate—how could it be spoken of in the same breath as lesser, peripheral methods? Begin swiftly, for even now it may be too late. A thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises say nothing of the initial work—only oral formulas transmit it. At the outset, one wields the key to heaven and earth’s treasury, gathers the *daogui* of Kan and Li, draws the body’s spirits into the central palace of the celestial valley. Swallowing and nurturing them, the spirits return to their root—this is called *\"returning the wind.\"* Merging and sealing the root’s source, this is the Way of guarding the true one. *The Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* states: *\"The spirit-chamber’s upper and lower crucibles— / Transformation lies in your hands.\"* Thus the True Unity Master discusses the green serpent’s sword; the Old Man of Western Shu grasps the golden hammer’s subtlety; Master Lü likens it to a firebrand; the Empty Horn of Qingcheng says a sword is not the Way. All these exhaust the traces, dissect the primordial root—without beginning the work, to merely discuss the golden elixir is to achieve nothing. An ancient song says: *\"When the sage grasps creation’s intent, / Hand-seizing sun and moon, he sets them in the furnace.\"* *The Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence* declares: *\"The cosmos lies in your hands, / The ten thousand transformations arise in your body.\"* To study without encountering a teacher is to encounter no one; to encounter one without diligence is to remain a lesser ghost. Laozi said: *\"The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it.\"* The immortal’s Way can only be cultivated by humans. As the ancients said: *\"Immortals are but mortals made.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Know this: the wheel of rebirth turns endlessly, and karmic retribution is inescapable. Wealth, honor, and glory are but fleeting schemes—begin your practice swiftly, for even now you may fear it is too late.\n\nThe path to Penglai\nrests on three thousand deeds fulfilled,\nalone you tread the clouds to return.\n\nThe three isles of Penglai are the immortal mountains upon the sea. Within the human body, too, there are three isles of Penglai: the crown is the Upper Isle, the heart the Middle Isle, and the kidneys the Lower Isle. Master Zi Qing’s poem says: *\"Within the human body lies a Penglai of its own.\"* The three thousand meritorious deeds are the count of nine years embracing the One. When nine years of practice are complete, one may divide form and scatter radiance, or emerge from being and enter non-being, or ascend lightly on distant journeys—hidden or manifest, beyond all reckoning. Some exchange their bones to ascend as immortals, roaming the Isles of Penglai; others are summoned by the Great One, dwelling in the Central Elixir, each according to the depth of their merit and practice.\n\n*The Broken Headband* says:\n*\"When nine years of practice are complete,\nForm remains in the world, unaware of spring.\nSuddenly the Heavenly Gate shatters at the crown,\nThe perfected one appears with great spiritual power—\nFrom this moment, celestial immortals may offer their congratulations.\"*\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n*\"When the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected,\nOne conceals oneself awaiting the appointed time.\nSummoned by the Great One,\nYou move to dwell in the Central Elixir.\nWhen merit is fulfilled and ascension achieved,\nYou receive the chart and are recorded.\"*\n\nImmortal Peng annotates:\n*\"The Perfected Lord of the Great One presides over inner cultivation. When mortals first attain the Dao, their names are engraved on the golden tablets of this elixir. Receiving the chart and being recorded, they thereby achieve ascension.\"*\n\n*Collected Writings on the Great Achievement of the Golden Elixir, Volume Thirteen* concludes.",
      "overlap_context": " moon, he sets them in the furnace.\"* *The Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence* declares: *\"The cosmos lies in your hands, / The ten thousand transformations arise in your body.\"* To study without encountering a teacher is to encounter no one; to encounter one without diligence is to remain a lesser ghost. Laozi said: *\"The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it.\"* The immortal’s Way can only be cultivated by humans. As the ancients said: *\"Immortals are but mortals made.\"*",
