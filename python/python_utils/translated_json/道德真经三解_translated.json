  "full_translation": "*The Threefold Exegesis of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*\n**Title:** *The Threefold Exegesis of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*\nBy Deng Qi of the Yuan Dynasty. Four fascicles.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Washen* Section, Jade Instructions Category.\n\n**Preface to *The Threefold Exegesis of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***\nBy Deng Qi, the Jade Guest\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao is the Perfected One of the Four Extremities.\n*Tai* (Most) is the extremity of greatness.\n*Shang* (High) is the extremity of loftiness.\n*Lao* (Old) is the extremity of longevity.\n*Jun* (Lord) is the extremity of humanity.\nThus, he is called the Four Extremities.\n\nThe *Zhouyi*’s Upper Canon begins with the number three, and its Lower Canon concludes with four, comprising sixty-four hexagrams.\nThe *Daode*’s Upper Canon begins with three, and its Lower Canon concludes with four, comprising eighty-one chapters.\nThe *Tai Xuan*’s directions commence with three, and its domains culminate in nine, aligning with the *Yi*’s eighty-one heads—Dao and virtue converge as one.\n\nWas Master Heshang not extraordinary?\nLaozi cultivated the Dao and its virtue, concealing himself in namelessness. Dwelling in Zhou for a long time, he eventually departed to wander westward. Guanling Yin Xi, a man of great capacity, perceived his qi in advance and knew a perfected one was approaching. He sought him out and awaited his arrival. Thus, he recognized Laozi amid the dust of the world, and believing the great Dao was about to withdraw, urgently entreated him to compose a text—an act akin to that of a sage. Laozi, recognizing his uniqueness, expounded the two canons, Upper and Lower. Vast yet without exterior, minute yet without interior, spherical yet without circumference, square yet without corners—this is called the Beginningless. Since the kalpas began, heaven and earth have seen the great Dao emerge and enter through the midst of sages, embracing the Three Powers and doubling them.\n\nThus, the five thousand words gallop across the primordial mind-ground of Fuxi, leaving no tracks. If one clings to chapter and verse, it becomes but a circling within the footprints of the Zhou and Confucius, grasping at images and things—how then can one perceive the Dao and its virtue? Hence, the learning of Zhuangzi and Liezi indulges in grandiloquence and eloquence, while the learning of Shen Buhai and Han Fei specializes in penal codes and names.\n\nThe learning of Wang and Xie borrows the guise of abstruse discourse. Yet this is not the case where \"the benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom\"—it is precisely what the Five Hegemons did, using empty names to seize real profit. How then can one perceive the heart of Laozi? Now, in the leisure between studying the *Zhouyi* and the *Analects*, with remaining strength, I have reverently followed the chapter and verse of the *Daode*, dividing it into three interpretations. Thus, one knows that heaven and earth are vast, yet creation is one, emerging from the sage—acting without action. Is its purport not profound?\n\nThe first interpretation, \"Scripture,\" merely adjusts the punctuation of the original text, adding or removing one or two function words, so that the reader first grasps the righteousness of each chapter, naturally complete and without flaw.\n\nThe second interpretation, \"Dao,\" directly expounds the great Dao of heaven and earth, its beginning and end, origin and return, its numbers and principles fitting like tallying tokens.\n\nThe third interpretation, \"Virtue,\" interweaves qian and kun, inverts water and fire, aligns east-metal with west-wood, coagulates mercury and congeals lead—every movement and stillness harmonizing with the great Dao.\n\nIn total, over fifty thousand words, titled *Three Interpretations*. The *Daodejing* aligns with the *Great Change*; where it cannot accommodate the heart-mind, the sages before and after remain of one measure. Laozi’s single work takes true constancy as its essence. Yet commentators have blended it entirely with Dao and virtue, unaware of guest and host, superior and inferior, leading Confucians to recklessly generate divergent views, with no distinction to separate them.\n\nHere, I first set forth the *Three Hundred Characters on True Constancy*, matching the number of the *Yinfu*, arranging them in the preface, so that later scholars of Dao and virtue may not stray far from their return.\n\nScholars of the four directions who verify the Dao, peruse and examine this work—if there is anything worthy of adoption, it would suffice for this humble woodcutter to hear his name.\n\nPreface by Deng Qi, the Jade Guest, in the autumn of the *wuxu* year of the Dade reign (1308).\n\n**Three Hundred Characters on True Constancy**\n\nThe constancy of true constancy is called constancy;\nThe truth of true truth is called truth.\nTrue constancy in the Dao embraces all;\nTrue constancy in virtue regulates all;\nTrue constancy in life determines all;\nTrue constancy in nature responds to all;\nTrue constancy in principle governs all.\n\nBefore heaven and earth began, true constancy truly abides;\nAfter heaven and earth end, true constancy truly empties.\nAll things bear yin and embrace yang;\nThe sage thereby possesses constancy.\nThe great Dao can decay yet not renew;\nThe sage thereby possesses truth.\nIf truth had form, it would be boundless and void;\nIf constancy had a name, it would be bodiless yet present.\n\nThe Dao is constantly without action yet nothing is left undone;\nThe true Dao is empty and follows, yet nothing follows it.\nWhen the sage ascends to the utmost, he is true, merging with the Dao in truth.\nAbove and below have no constancy; movement and stillness have constancy.\nQian begins by benefiting all under heaven with beauty and profit, yet does not speak of what it profits;\nWater benefits all things with beauty and profit, yet does not speak of its virtue.\n\nActing for the sake of action loses truth;\nNot employing it returns to constancy.\nThe sun and moon alternate to generate light;\nCold and heat alternate to complete the year—\nThus true constancy has no form or name.\nThe Dao of heaven speaks not yet reveals its merit;\nThe Dao of earth achieves not yet succeeds in its end—\nThus true constancy is not empty nothingness.\n\nEmptiness and nothingness succeed one another;\nHeaven and earth have no substance.\nWithout emptiness, without substance,\nOne returns to the limitless.\nWithout limit, without boundary,\nTrue constancy then rests.\nThe rest of true constancy is profoundly without rest;\nThe rest without rest—\nTrue constancy then ceases.\nThe cessation of true constancy is profoundly without cessation;\nThe cessation without cessation—\nUtterly unattainable, utterly unlosable.\nThus true constancy does not vainly cease.\n\n**The Great Transmission of Laozi**\n\nLaozi was a native of Quren Village, Lixiang, Ku County in Chu. His surname was Li, given name Er, courtesy name Boyang, posthumous name Dan. He was the keeper of archives in Zhou. When Confucius visited Zhou, he was about to inquire about ritual from Laozi.\n\nLaozi said: \"What you speak of—the man and his bones have already decayed; only his words remain. Moreover, when the noble person meets his time, he mounts his carriage; when he does not meet his time, he drifts like tumbleweed. I have heard that a good merchant hides his wealth as if empty, and a noble person of great virtue appears foolish. Rid yourself of your arrogance, excessive desires, affected demeanor, and extravagant ambitions—these are all of no benefit to your person. What I have to tell you is only this.\"\n\nThe *Family Sayings* and *Observing Zhou* record this in detail.\n\nConfucius departed and said to his disciples: \"Birds—I know they can fly; fish—I know they can swim; beasts—I know they can run. Those that run may be caught in nets, those that swim may be caught with lines, those that fly may be struck down with arrows. But as for the dragon, I cannot know it—how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend the heavens. Today I have seen Laozi—is he not like the dragon?\n\nLaozi cultivated the Dao and its virtue, taking concealment and namelessness as his practice. He dwelled long in Zhou, but seeing its decline, he departed. When he reached the pass, the Keeper of the Pass, Yin Xi, said: 'You are about to withdraw from the world—compel yourself to write a book for me.' Thereupon Laozi composed a work in two scrolls, expounding the meaning of the Dao and its virtue in over five thousand words, then left. None knew where he ended.\n\nSome say Lao Laizi was also a man of Chu, who wrote fifteen scrolls on the application of the Daoist teachings, and was a contemporary of Confucius. Laozi was said to have lived over one hundred and sixty years, or even over two hundred, due to his cultivation of the Dao and nurturing of longevity.\n\nOne hundred and twenty-nine years after Confucius’ death, the Grand Historian Tan of Zhou met Duke Xian of Qin and said: 'At first, Qin and Zhou were united, then parted; after five hundred years they will unite again, and after seventy years a hegemon-king will arise.' Some say Dan was Laozi himself; others say he was not. The world knows not whether this is so or not.\n\nLaozi was a reclusive gentleman. Laozi’s son was named Zong, who became a general of Wei and was enfeoffed at Duan’gan. Zong’s son was Zhu; Zhu’s son was Gong; Gong’s great-great-grandson was Jia, who served under Emperor Wen of Han. At that time, Jia’s son Jie was Grand Tutor to King Gong of Jiaoxi and thus settled his family in Qi.\n\nThose who study Laozi disparage the Confucians, and the Confucians likewise disparage Laozi. 'The Dao differs—there is no shared counsel between them.' Could this be what is meant?\n\nLi Er embodied non-action and self-transformation, purity and self-rectification.\n\nThe Left Immortal Duke Ge Xuan said: In the Zhou era, Laozi once manifested as a divine being. His mother gave birth to him by splitting open her left armpit, and at birth he was radiant, thus named 'Supreme.' Emerging through the Mystery, he existed before heaven and earth, without age or decline, hence called 'Supreme'—the incarnate form of the Three Pure Ones.\n\n**The Orthodox Lineage of the Great Dao**\n\nThe teaching of the Mysterious School takes purity, emptiness, and the Correct Unity as its essence, and immortality as its joy. Thus, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Floating Radiance, after countless kalpas, attained the Three Pure Ones. And from the Three Pure Ones, after countless millennia, he descended as Laozi to deliver the Perfected One Yin Xi. Through Immortal Minister Li Yi, spanning ten generations from Zhou to Han, the transmission continued.\n\nThereafter, the Venerable Man of the River emerged. From Anqisheng, through nine transmissions, it reached the Three Yangs, extending into the Five Dynasties. From the time the Three Yangs first proclaimed the Dao, through the lineage of the True Man Hai Chan, it passed to Zhang Ziyang, then to Wang Chongyang. Ziyang transmitted it to Cui Xuan; Cui Xuan to Zi Xian; Zi Xian to Cui Xu; Cui Xu to Hai Qiong—nine transmissions in all for the Master. Wang Chongyang’s transmission branched into the Seven Perfected, with countless hidden connections, collateral teachings, and universal deliverance—numbering in the millions. As for the orthodox transmission of the Great Dao, it has now reached the thirty-fifth generation in Master Hai Qiong.\n\nOnly the sages of antiquity enjoyed extended lifespans, their years and kalpas immeasurably long. From the middle ancient era, Heaven did not withhold the Dao, spreading it among humanity to deliver countless beings. The span of its transmission to the present is likewise incalculable.\n\nAfter Hai Qiong, the singular thread of the Great Dao passed to the Master of Crane Forest, who revived the lost learning of the former sages and established the Dharma-gate for later generations. In leisure, reflecting on the difficulty of transmission and tracing its origins, I have set forth its lineage and committed it to print.\n\nTingzhi, humbly numbered among the disciples of the Master of Crane Forest, now burns incense, bows deeply, and records this. Written on the winter solstice of the *gengshen* year by disciple Xiao Tingzhi.\n\n**The Chronology of the Great Dao**\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Floating Radiance is the Dao that generates the Supreme Ultimate. After thirty-two thousand four hundred years, it reached the Jade Pure Primordial Heavenly Worthy—'the Dao generates the One,' hence matched with Fuxi, the Heavenly Sovereign. After another ten thousand eight hundred years, it reached the Supreme Pure Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy—'the One generates the Two,' hence matched with Shennong, the Earthly Sovereign. After another ten thousand eight hundred years, it reached the Grand Pure Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and its Virtue—'the Two generates the Three,' hence matched with Xuanyuan, the Human Sovereign.\n\nThe Grand Pure Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and its Virtue, together with the Supreme Primordial Lady, transmitted the precelestial Great Dao—'the Three generates the myriad things,' hence matched with the seventy-two masters led by Master Guangcheng. After another one thousand nine hundred years, it reached the Highest Laozi, at which time the Compassionate Sage was also born into the world. 'The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,' and the division of yin and yang established the Two Modes. Thus, the seventy-two worthies led by the Great Sage Confucius were matched with them. 'The qi of harmony is the mean'—encompassing the Three Powers and doubling them.\n\nThe Three Teachings stood like the legs of a tripod in the world, and the Dao of kings and lords was complete. Thus it is said: 'Things may be diminished yet benefit, or increased yet suffer harm.' 'What others teach, I also teach.' 'The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death—I shall take this as the father of my teaching.' The chronology of the Great Dao fits like tallying tokens. The orthodoxy and its lineage are known to those who understand.\n\nRecorded by the Perfected One of Mount Qingcheng.\n\n**The Three Explanations of the *Dao and Its Virtue*: Scroll One**\n**Jade Guest Deng Qi’s Explanation**\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the constant name.\nNameless—it is the beginning of heaven and earth;\nNamed—it is the mother of the myriad things.\nAlways desireless, one observes its mystery;\nAlways desiring, one observes its manifestations.\n\nAlways desiring, one observes its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet bear different names—\nboth are called the profound.\nProfound and yet more profound:\nthe gateway to all mysteries.\n\nThe *Scripture* states: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not the constant name. Nameless—it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named—it is the mother of the myriad things. Always desireless, one thereby observes its mystery; always desiring, one thereby observes its manifestations.\" Mystery is the constancy of the nameless; manifestation is the Dao of the named. These two emerge from the same source yet serve as different guests—hence they are called distinct. Both are termed the profound. Profound and yet more profound: the gateway to all mysteries.\n\nThe Dao declares: \"Without thought, without action—this is called the constant Dao. Spiritually wondrous and unified in governance—this is called the constant name.\" The Dao is the central emptiness of the Great Ultimate. The name is the great image of heaven and earth. Within the central emptiness of the Great Ultimate, what Dao is absent? Yet when divided among the myriad things, each possesses its own Dao. How can the Dao of a single thing encompass the whole? Unable to encompass the whole, one imposes names by force—such forced naming is not the constant Dao. Within the great image of heaven and earth, what name is absent? Yet when manifested in the myriad things, each bears its own name. How can the name of a single thing encompass all? Unable to encompass all, one imposes names by force—such forced naming is not the constant name.\n\nBefore heaven and earth were born, what name could there be at the beginningless beginning? Once the myriad things are formed, without the mother, what shape could there be? To observe its mystery, there is the Dao of constant non-being. To observe its manifestations, there is the Dao of constant being. These two emerge together from non-thought and non-action, bearing different names in the spiritually wondrous and unified—thus they are called the profound. Profound and yet more profound: the gateway to all mysteries. Those who ascend the hall, enter the chamber, and preside over the innermost—are they not the sages?\n\nThe *Virtue* states: \"When male and female are yet to unite, only essence and oneness hold fast to the center.\" The Dao that cannot be spoken abides in the constant Dao; the name that cannot be named abides in the constant name. Nameless—it is the beginning of heaven and earth. Everlasting are husband and wife, male and female dwelling together, the great human bond, embracing the infant. The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Named—it is the mother of the myriad things. Ceasing to speak of male above and female below, all things transform from negation. Always desireless, one thereby observes its mystery. Yielding and moving, hardness and softness respond in kind, all things transform from peace. Always desiring, one thereby observes its subtleties.\n\nThat by which heaven and earth become heaven and earth is the constant Dao. That by which male and female become heaven and earth is the constant name. These two converge yet follow different paths, emerge from the same source yet bear different names; governed by one principle yet with a hundred considerations, they diverge yet share the same name. Thus it is said: both are termed the profound. Profound and yet more profound: the gateway to all mysteries. To enter the gateway of all mysteries, one must encounter the perfected. **Chapter Two: \"When All Under Heaven Know\"**\n\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.\nThus being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short shape each other,\nHigh and low incline toward each other,\nTones and voices harmonize with each other,\nFront and back follow each other.\n\nTherefore the sage abides in non-action,\nPractices the teaching without words,\nAllows the myriad things to arise without initiating,\nGives life without possessing,\nActs without relying,\nCompletes without dwelling.\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart.\n\nThe *Scripture* states: \"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, this is ugliness. When all know goodness as goodness, this is not-goodness. Thus beauty and ugliness oppose each other, being and non-being give rise to each other, difficulty and ease complete each other, long and short shape each other, high and low incline toward each other, tone and voice harmonize with each other, front and back follow each other. Therefore the sage abides in non-action, practices the teaching without words, allows the myriad things to arise without claiming, for they give life without possessing, act without relying, complete without dwelling. By not dwelling, all under heaven cannot remove their beauty.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"Without the myriad things, one does not know there are humans; without humans, one does not know there are heaven and earth; without heaven and earth, one does not know there is the Dao—how could one know the constant? As the constant Dao, who could deem it ugly? Yet when the myriad things arise together, beauty and ugliness take shape within them. Thus in the affairs of all under heaven, without ugliness one does not know beauty; without not-goodness one does not know goodness. Once beauty is known as beauty and goodness as goodness, then ugliness and not-goodness are distinguished within them—hence the Dao of mutual arising, mutual completing, mutual shaping, and mutual inclining abides therein. Therefore the sage abides in non-action and the people transform themselves, practices the teaching without words and the people trust themselves. Though the myriad things arise, they do not claim, for heaven and earth give life of themselves without possessing me, act of themselves without relying on me, complete of themselves without dwelling in me. By upholding this non-dwelling, the beauty of the sage cannot be removed.\"\n\nThe *Virtue* states: \"Yin and yang, movement and stillness, serve as each other’s foundation; hardness and softness, substance and function, form each other—all are the supreme beauty of all under heaven. To know the Dao in beauty is constancy; to know beauty as beauty is desire. To take desire as the Dao—this is ugliness. When Qian and Kun intermingle, Kan and Li are born; when Kan and Li intermingle, heaven and earth are restored. When all under heaven know intermingling as the Dao, is this not perfect goodness and perfect beauty? When all take intermingling as desire, how can this not be called ugliness? Thus being and non-being give rise to each other, as the sun and moon shine together; difficulty and ease complete each other, as water and fire restrain each other; long and short shape each other, as the crescent and full moon differ; high and low incline toward each other, as yin and yang press upon each other.\"\n\nSounds harmonize with each other, as yang leads and yin responds; front and rear follow one another, as the two, three, six, and nine. Thus though the sage may wish to act, what is there to act upon? Though he may wish to teach, what is there to say? The myriad things arise together—what is there to reject? Therefore he gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, accomplishes yet does not dwell. Thus the sage can perfect the beauty of all under heaven, and so his days do not pass away.\n\nIf there is an \"I,\" he inevitably loses the Dao of spontaneity and falls into excess—how can this not be called ugliness?\n\n**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Worthy**\nNot exalting the worthy makes the people not contend; not prizing rare goods makes the people not steal; not displaying what is desirable keeps the people’s hearts from disorder. Therefore in the sage’s governance, he empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones. He constantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire, so that those with knowledge dare not act. Acting through non-action, there is nothing that is not well-ordered.\n\nThe *Classic* says: If one does not exalt the worthy, what use is contention among the people? If one does not prize rare goods, what use is theft among the people? If one does not display what is desirable, the people naturally do not fall into disorder. Thus in the sage’s governance, he constantly empties the mind through the Dao, fills the belly with the myriad things, weakens ambition through non-action, and strengthens the bones through non-doing. Naturally, the people are without knowledge and without desire, and even if there are those with knowledge, they dare not act. Acting through non-action, all under heaven is without disorder.\n\nThe *Dao* says: The ease of what precedes design—governing through non-action—rising, they breathe gently; resting, they sigh softly. Eating raw flesh and drinking blood, the people and things transform themselves. Ever since *Daxu* exalted the worthy, there has been *Yi*’s self-indulgence; ever since *Shihe* amassed goods, there have been *Yu*’s violent bandits. Thus not displaying what is desirable keeps the people’s hearts from disorder.\n\nTherefore in the sage’s governance, he takes the heart of all under heaven as his heart, ever receiving others with emptiness; he takes the belly of all under heaven as his belly, ever renewing virtue with fullness. Valuing the lowly and the noble alike, he greatly wins the people—thus he weakens their ambitions. The great person has achievements, ever strengthening himself without ceasing—thus he strengthens their bones. He constantly keeps the people without means to know, without means to desire, so that even if one or two with knowledge exist, they dare not act. For when the sage acts through non-action, all under heaven is without disorder.\n\nThe *Virtue* says: Within the body, worthy conduct is naturally not exalted—who would contend? Within the body, goods are naturally not prized—who would steal? Without contention, without theft, without displaying what is desirable, the people naturally do not fall into disorder. But if one makes them know, they contend over worthiness without exalting the worthy, steal goods without prizing them, and follow their hearts’ desires without restraint. When worthiness is destroyed and goods are exhausted, how can this last long?\n\nThus in the sage’s governance, he empties the mind with true constancy and utmost stillness, fills the belly with heaven and earth and sun and moon, weakens ambition with southern water and northern fire, and strengthens the bones with eastern metal and western wood. The people naturally have no knowledge, naturally have no desire, so that those with knowledge dare not act for their entire lives. For acting through action, there is nothing that is not disordered; acting through non-action, there is nothing that is not well-ordered.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Profundity**\nThe Dao is profound and used, yet it is never full. Abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. It blunts their sharpness, unties their tangles, harmonizes their radiance, and mingles with their dust. Deep and clear, it seems to endure. I do not know whose child it is—it seems prior to the Lord of Heaven.\n\nThe *Classic* says: Using the Dao’s profundity, it is never full. Vast and abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. It blunts the sharpness of their qi, unties the tangles of things, harmonizes their brilliance, and mingles with their dust. Clear and still, the Dao seems to endure. Those who attain this Dao—I do not know whose child they are—it seems the Lord of Heaven emerges prior to *Zhen*.\n\nThe *Dao* says: Pure qi rises to become heaven, turbid qi descends to become earth, and the harmonizing qi in the center becomes humans. Heaven and earth serve as the Dao’s function, yet they are never full; humans serve as the function of heaven and earth, yet they are never filled. When filled, they nearly come to rest.\n\nThus the sage, equal in sageliness and vast in depth, seems the ancestor of the myriad things. Ever with the upright qi, he blunts its sharpness, unties its tangles, harmonizes its radiance, and mingles with its dust. Clear and still, the Dao constantly seems to endure. Is he not prior to the people of the *Fuxi* era? Since *Fuxi*, the Dao has been used to its utmost. The Great Ultimate’s single circle—when has it ever been full? Void and bright, clear and penetrating, it is the ancestor of the myriad things. Using the round to cut the square blunts its sharpness; dividing yin and yang unties its tangles; alternating softness and hardness harmonizes its radiance; the six positions completing their patterns mingle with its dust. Changing and moving without abiding, flowing through the six voids, the Dao is deep and clear, enduring within them. I do not know whose child it is—it seems the image of the Lord of Heaven emerging from *Zhen*.\n\nThe *Virtue* says: Profundity is emptiness within. Using the Dao, it is never full—if full, it would exceed expectations. Deep and abysmal, it is the ancestor of the myriad things. With emptiness within, there is something—what else could it be but the ancestor? Though it blunts their sharpness, from where does it blunt them? Though it unties their tangles, from where does it untie them? Though it harmonizes their radiance, from where does it harmonize them? Though it mingles with their dust, from where does it mingle with them? Clear and still, each has the Dao enduring within—this single profound thing, I do not know whose child it will be. Those who become its child, within a single time period, seem prior to the Lord of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent—they regard the myriad things as straw dogs; the sage is not benevolent—he regards the hundred clans as straw dogs. Is not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows? Empty yet not collapsing, moving and ever producing. Much speech leads to exhaustion—it is better to guard the center.\n\nThe Scripture states: Heaven and earth are not seven—how then do they regard the myriad things as straw dogs? They jointly uphold the Dao. The sage is not benevolent—how then does he regard the hundred clans as straw dogs? They jointly uphold heaven and earth. Are not the myriad things and the hundred clans like straw dogs? The Dao’s emptiness, the space between heaven and earth—is it not like a bellows? The qi’s emptiness: though void, it does not collapse; the more it moves, the more it produces. Better to guard emptiness. Much speech leads to exhaustion—better to guard the center.\n\nThe Dao says: Laying out white thatch—this is the utmost caution. That straw, though slight, may bear great weight. Exercise such caution in all arts, and you shall never err. Heaven and earth bestow no grace, yet great grace arises; thunder and fierce winds stir all things without exception. Heaven and earth are not benevolent, yet they are benevolent. The sage tempers severity with lenience, lenience with severity; severity and lenience balance each other, and governance is harmonized. The sage is not benevolent. The sage’s relation to the hundred clans is as heaven and earth’s to the myriad things: if unused, they are set aside; if used, they are honored as in sacrifice—what could be weightier? Straw dogs are what heaven, earth, and the sage hold in highest regard. Though the myriad things differ, none may join heaven in serving the Dao; though the hundred clans differ, none may join the sage in serving heaven. Only the straw dog may join heaven, earth, and the sage in this service. Do heaven, earth, and the sage not show benevolence to the myriad things and the hundred clans? Yet the myriad things and the hundred clans use them daily without knowing they are heaven and earth’s, the sage’s straw dogs—is their benevolence not profound?\n\nBetween heaven and earth, Kun is the bellows-sack, Qian the pipe and key. Thus, closing the door is Kun, opening it is Qian; one closing and one opening is called change, ceaseless coming and going is called passage. Hence, “empty yet not collapsing, moving and ever producing.” Therefore, the sage guards the center; his words do not reach exhaustion. When exhaustion comes, change follows; change brings passage, passage brings endurance. This does not depart from the sage’s center—hence, “it is better to guard the center.”\n\nVirtue says: Do heaven and earth ever fail to be benevolent? Things live by their own life, die by their own death. Does the sage ever fail to be benevolent? People live out their years or die young by their own fate. Life and death, long years and early demise—creatures and people bring these upon themselves. How could heaven, earth, and the sage be other than benevolent? To harm heaven and earth is the sage’s benevolence. If one knows that creatures and people are straw dogs, and heaven and earth are bellows, then one may forge the furnace to encircle heaven, wield hammer and tongs at the Supreme Ultimate, draw forth and replenish the sun and moon, set the stars in motion, transmute iron into gold, transcend the ordinary to enter sagehood, so that heaven cannot fulfill its numbers, the sage cannot claim his people. Though called not benevolent, where could benevolence be applied? Thus, “empty yet not collapsing, moving and ever producing.” No need for much speech—much speech leads to exhaustion. Better to guard the center, to regard heaven and self as one, past and present as one, the myriad things and self as one.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**\nThe valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Subtly, it seems to endure; its use is inexhaustible.\n\nThe Scripture states: An empty valley carries sound—its spirit does not die. This spirit is called the Mysterious Female. Heaven is the Mysterious, earth is the Female; Qian and Kun are the gates of change. The gate of Qian and Kun is called the root of heaven and earth. Subtly, it forms nature; enduring, it is ever in use, not through striving. The Dao says: In *Ascending*, the nine in the third place ascends to an empty city—heaven and earth are like a valley. Above and below are empty, yet its spirit does not die. Growth, harvest, storage, and the arising of the myriad things—this is called the Mysterious Female. In the top six, darkly ascending to its proper correlate, it is beneficial to persevere in unceasing integrity—this is the gate of the Mysterious Female. Returning to the first yang in the Kan trigram, wood grows within earth—this is called the root of heaven and earth. Thus, “subtly, it seems to endure; its use is inexhaustible.” The double-yang flower, if not distant, must die.\n\nVirtue says: The chamber of the valley spirit dwells in the Northern Sea, presiding over the watery abode. It has a name but no form, its transformations are unfathomable. Above, it joins the Mysterious of heaven; below, it unites with the Female of earth. The Mysterious and Female merge in the valley—its spirit does not die. “The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.” Thus, “the gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.” “The hidden dragon does not act”—subtly, it seems to endure. If used, it startles for a hundred leagues—hence, “its use is inexhaustible.” Master Ziyang said: To keep the valley spirit ever undying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root. When true essence returns to the golden chamber, a single bright pearl will never depart. He also said: The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known; most mistakenly apply it to mouth and nose. Though you may practice breath control for a thousand years, how can you seize the golden crow and the jade hare? Only those who truly know the Mysterious Female understand.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Endure**\nHeaven and earth endure. The reason heaven and earth can be long and enduring is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can long endure. Therefore, the sage places himself last and finds himself first, sets himself outside and finds himself preserved. Is it not because he is without self-interest? Thus he can fulfill his self-interest.\n\nThe Scripture states: Heaven and earth endure—the Dao is ever without action. The reason heaven can be long and earth can endure is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can long endure. Therefore, the sage places himself last and finds himself first, sets himself outside and finds himself preserved. Lasting in being last, lasting in being outside—is it not because he is without self-interest? Finding himself first, finding himself preserved—thus he can fulfill his self-interest. The Dao says: Thus, the *Book of Changes* has the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams determine good and ill fortune; good and ill fortune give rise to great undertakings. The reason heaven can be long and enduring is that it does not live for itself—thus it can long endure. Therefore, the sage places himself last and finds himself first; his Dao thus enables him to be first.\n\nSetting himself outside yet preserving himself—his Dao thus enables him to preserve himself. Is it not because he is without self-interest? His self is first preserved by the Dao, thus he can fulfill his self-interest.\n\nVirtue says: Heaven and earth can be long and enduring because they do not live for themselves. The sage can be long and enduring because he does not live for himself. If heaven and earth lived for themselves, they would not endure long before perishing. If the sage lived for himself, he would not endure long before failing. Therefore, the sage first nurtures others’ selves and thus can possess his own self; he first preserves others’ selves and thus can set his own self outside. Is this not because he is without self-interest? Putting others first and himself last, he thus fulfills his self-interest.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Highest Virtue Resembles Water**\nThe highest virtue resembles water. Water benefits the myriad things without contention, dwelling in places all others shun—thus it nearly approaches the Dao.\nDwelling in good earth, the mind in profound depth,\nGiving with goodwill, speaking with good faith,\nGoverning with good order, handling affairs with good skill,\nMoving with good timing.\nOnly by not contending does one remain free from blame.\n\nThe Classic says: The highest virtue resembles water. Water benefits the myriad things without contention, flowing to the lowest places, dwelling where all others shun—thus it nearly approaches the Dao.\nIn dwelling, it is good at earth;\nIn the mind, it is good at depth;\nIn giving, it is good at humaneness;\nIn speech, it is good at sincerity;\nIn governance, it is good at order;\nIn affairs, it is good at skill;\nIn movement, it is good at timing.\nThrough this non-contention, it remains free from fault.\n\nThe Dao says: Heaven is one, earth is six; Qian and Kan form water. Qian knows the great beginning; Kan presides over labor and movement—thus it is called the highest virtue. Qian, as the beginning, can bestow great benefit upon all under heaven without speaking of what it bestows—how then could it contend? Kan as water is the place where the myriad things return and are stored, dwelling where all others shun—thus it nearly approaches the Dao.\nDwelling in good earth: the perilous heights of heaven cannot be scaled; the perilous earth comprises mountains, rivers, hills, and mounds.\nThe mind in profound depth: water flows yet does not overflow.\nGiving with goodwill: conduct is esteemed, and going forth brings merit.\nSpeaking with good faith: traversing peril without losing trust.\nGoverning with good order: only with a penetrating mind can one be firm yet centered.\nHandling affairs with good skill: kings and lords set perils to guard their states.\nMoving with good timing: the timely use of peril—how great it is!\nOnly by not contending—laboring through Kan—though laboring, who can find fault with it? Thus it remains free from blame.\n\nVirtue says: As Master Ziyang said of the *White Tiger’s First Classic* and the divine water of the Treasure Flower Pool’s true gold, one then understands that the source of the highest virtue’s benefit runs deep—unlike ordinary medicinal substances. Why, though dwelling where all others shun, does it nearly approach the Dao? Within Kan lies return, the return to the root and restoration of life.\nDwelling in good earth: first, one must obtain the proper place.\nThe mind in profound depth: first, one must practice non-action.\nGiving with goodwill: first, one must choose companions wisely.\nSpeaking with good faith: one dare not lose the proper time.\nGoverning with good order: enriching the state and pacifying the people.\nHandling affairs with good skill: strengthening the army and securing victory.\nMoving with good timing: morning in *tun*, evening in *meng*.\nDare not contend for profit to gain strength.\nContention brings fault; only by not contending does one remain free from blame.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding to Fullness**\nHolding to fullness is not as good as stopping in time.\nSharpening to a point cannot be long preserved.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.\nWealth and nobility with arrogance bring one’s own downfall.\nTo withdraw when the work is done, the name achieved, and the self preserved—this is the Dao of heaven.\n\nThe Classic says: Holding to fullness—when gold and jade fill the hall—is not as good as stopping in time; none can guard them. Sharpening to a point—wealth and nobility with arrogance—cannot be long preserved; they bring one’s own downfall. To withdraw when the work is done, the name achieved, and the self preserved—this is the Dao of heaven.\n\nThe Dao says: The Dao of heaven diminishes the full and augments the humble; the Dao of earth transforms the full and flows to the humble; ghosts and spirits harm the full and bless the humble; the human Dao detests the full and favors the humble. Thus Kan does not fill—only when the banks are level is there no fault. When full, the Dao of Kan is lost—thus it is not as good as stopping in time. Affairs with pointed edges are not perfectly formed; sharpening to a point will surely blunt its edge—thus it cannot be long preserved. When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them; holding to fullness—wealth and nobility with arrogance—brings one’s own downfall, for it is sharpening to a point. Thus, to withdraw when the work is done, the name achieved, and the self preserved—this is the Dao of heaven.\n\nVirtue says: Essence and qi become things; wandering souls bring change. Thus one knows the conditions of ghosts and spirits—the Dao of holding to fullness while nurturing the po. Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen: the moon is full at *jia*; sun and moon face each other—this is the time for holding and guarding. Exceed it, and it wanes. Thus the sun, when full, declines; the moon, when full, is eclipsed. Heaven and earth wax and wane with time’s ebb and flow. Those who seize the workings of creation do not act thus: when the moon is full, when gold and jade fill the hall, why hold to fullness and guard achievement? To retreat and hide in secrecy is sufficient. This is the Dao of heaven. To advance further is like the dragon soaring too high—regret follows, for it has sharpened its point. Thus, to dwell in high position without arrogance: if one dwells above and is arrogant, who is to blame for the downfall?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Nurturing the Po**\nCan you nurture the po and embrace the One without separation?\nCan you concentrate qi to attain softness, like a newborn babe?\nCan you cleanse and purify your profound mirror, leaving no blemish?\nCan you love the people and govern the state without action?\nCan you open and close the gates of heaven without acting as the female?\nCan you comprehend the four directions without knowledge?\nGive life and nourish,\nGive life yet do not possess,\nAct yet do not rely,\nLead yet do not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\nThe Classic says: The sun nurtures, the moon embodies the po—can you embrace the One without separation? Yang qi attains softness—can you be like a newborn babe? Cleanse and purify the profound mirror—can you leave no blemish? Love the people and govern the state—can you do so without action? Open and close the gates of heaven—can you do so without acting as the female? Comprehend the four directions—can you do so without knowledge?\n\nThe Dao gives birth to it, and virtue nurtures it.\nThus, it is born yet does not possess itself,\nActs yet does not rely on itself,\nNourishes yet does not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\nThe Dao speaks:\nWhen the sun and moon align in measure,\nMeeting at the heavens and earth—\nThough one speaks of embracing the One,\nCan one truly remain undivided?\n\nThe sun and moon align in measure—\nThe *li* of *kǎn*’s separation;\nEmbrace the Primordial, guard the One—\nThe *li* of attachment;\nFifty-nine days and they reunite—\nThe *li* of parting.\n\n*Li* is the utmost refinement.\nWithin *kǎn*, one yang—\nThe concentrated *qi* of *qián*—\nThus the moon bears the *yíng* and the *pò*.\nWithin *li*, one yin—\nThe yielding *qi* of *kūn*—\nThus the sun is eclipsed.\n\nHaving generated *qián* and *kūn*, the heavens and earth,\n*Kǎn* and *li* emerge—\nThe Dao of sun and moon.\nThus, at dusk, it turns aside to death,\nAt new moon, it completes to life—\nCan one be like a newborn babe?\n\nGazing with the profound—\nIts origin is without blemish;\nPurifying and cleansing—\nCan one leave no flaw?\n\nThe people and the state—\nTheir origin is without action;\nLoving and governing them—\nCan one act without doing?\n\n*Qián* is the Heavenly Gate—\nIts origin is without the female;\nOpening and closing it—\nCan one do so without the female?\n\nFourfold and eightfold passage—\nIts origin is without knowing;\nIlluminating and clarifying—\nCan one do so without knowing?\n\nThe Heavenly Dao gives birth to it,\nThe Earthly virtue nurtures it—\nThus it is said:\nBorn yet not possessing,\nActing yet not relying,\nNourishing yet not dominating—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\nVirtue speaks:\nWhen *qián* and *kūn* intermingle, *kǎn* and *li* are born;\nWhen *kǎn* and *li* intermingle, *qián* and *kūn* return—\nThus it is said: the moon bears the *yíng* and *pò*.\n\nWithin *kūn*, *qián* intermingles to form *kǎn*’s one yang—\nEmbracing its One.\nWithin *qián*, *kūn* intermingles to form *li*’s one yin—\nThus it is said: embracing the One yet undivided.\n\n*Kǎn* is yin without, yang within—\nIts essence is *kūn*,\nYet it draws from *qián*’s center to become the inner male.\n*Li* is yang without, yin within—\nIts essence is *qián*,\nYet it draws from *kūn*’s center to become the inner female.\n\nThrough the inner male’s concentration,\nThe inner female’s yielding generates the babe—\nThus the return.\nThe union of father and mother generates all things—\nThus it is said: can one be like a newborn babe?\n\nThe Purple Yang says:\nTo hold *kǎn*’s center firm,\nTo transmute *li*’s inner yin—\nThis is it.\n\nAs for purifying the profound gaze,\nOpening and closing the Heavenly Gate—\nThese are the babe’s essence.\nIf one relies on them,\nIt burdens profound virtue.\n\n---\n**Thirty-Spoke Chapter, the Eleventh**\n\nThirty spokes converge at one hub—\nWhen there is nothing,\nThe wheel’s use is complete.\nClay is molded into vessels—\nWhen there is nothing,\nThe vessel’s use is complete.\nDoors and windows are carved for rooms—\nWhen there is nothing,\nThe room’s use is complete.\n\nThus, having is for advantage,\nNothingness is for use.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\nWhen hollow and turning,\nThe wheel’s use is complete.\nClay is molded into vessels,\nThe potter’s form is hollow within—\nThe vessel’s use is complete.\nDoors and windows are carved for rooms,\nThough pierced and hollowed,\nWhen empty and bright,\nThe room’s use is complete.\n\nThus, what is solid and has form is for advantage,\nWhat is hollow and without is for use.\n\nThe Dao speaks:\nThe Heavenly Circuit, three hundred sixty-five degrees,\nTwenty-eight mansions in total—\nLike the North Star,\nResiding in place while all stars gather to it—\nThe image of spokes and hub.\n\nThe North Pole’s *Tiāngōng*,\nTurning within one degree—\nThe image of nothingness.\n\nRevolving through the twenty-eight mansions,\nTo harmonize the Seven Governors—\nThe wheel’s use.\n\nThus, the use of things is the wheel;\nThe wheel’s use is emptiness.\n\nHeaven like a tilted canopy,\nEarth below, east and south—\nThe image of molding clay into vessels.\n\nThe rivers and seas rule over all valleys,\nBecause they excel in descending—\nThe image of nothingness.\n\nThey make the great *qi* swell and wane—\nThe image of vessels.\n\nThus, the use of things is the vessel;\nThe vessel’s use is receptivity.\n\nHeaven and Earth fix their positions,\nSun and moon shine together—\nThe image of doors and windows for rooms.\n\nEmpty rooms generate whiteness—\nThe image of nothingness.\n\nAll things arise together—\nThe room’s use.\n\nThus, the use of things is the room;\nThe room’s use is repose.\n\nTherefore, what is solid and has form is advantage;\nWhat is hollow and without is use.\n\nThus, great fullness seems like emptiness—\nIts use is inexhaustible.\n\nVirtue speaks:\nAt dawn of the new moon, *Tún* governs affairs,\nAt dusk, *Méng* receives its charge—\nDay and night, one hexagram each—\nUsed in proper sequence.\n\nExcluding *qián*, *kūn*, *kǎn*, and *li*’s four cardinals,\nOne month, thirty days, and sixty hexagrams are used—\nThus it is said: thirty spokes converge at one hub.\n\nBetween them, emptiness and fullness depend on each other,\nForm and use support each other,\nAdvance and retreat follow in turn,\nWater and fire pursue each other—\nWhen there is nothing, the wheel’s use is complete.\n\nAs for embracing the Primordial, guarding the One,\nTen months, the embryo rounds—\nThe image of molding clay into vessels.\n\nEmpty and detached, entering and exiting without resistance—\nThe image of the vessel’s use.\n\nCirculating through the Six *Jiǎ*,\nAligning with Heaven and Earth,\nCarving doors and windows for rooms—\nLife and essence both complete,\nSpirit and form both refined,\nChanging and transforming, merging with the Dao’s truth—\nThe image of the room’s use.\n\nThus, having is for advantage,\nNothingness is for use.\n\n---\n**Five Colors Chapter, the Twelfth**\n\n**The Chapter of the Five Colors, the Thirteenth**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate,\nGalloping hunts drive the heart to madness,\nRare treasures disrupt conduct.\nThus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—\nHe discards the former, takes the latter.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe five colors delight the eyes, yet blind them;\nThe five tones delight the ears, yet deafen them;\nThe five flavors delight the mouth, yet dull it;\nHunting delights the heart, yet drives it mad;\nRare treasures disrupt conduct.\nThus, the Sage does not act for the eyes but for the belly—\nHe discards their illusions, takes their truth.\n\nThe Way says:\nHeaven and Earth are thieves of all things,\nAll things are thieves of humanity,\nHumanity is thief of all things.\nWhen the three thieves are at ease, the Three Powers are at peace—\nThus, eating in season, the hundred bones are harmonized,\nThe mechanism moves, and all transformations are at rest.\n\nIf one does not pluck colors to gaze upon, the eyes remain clear;\nIf one does not listen to sounds, the ears remain keen;\nIf one does not indulge in meats and grains, the palate remains sharp;\nIf one does not chase beasts without restraint, the heart remains calm;\nIf one does not squander on treasures, conduct remains unobstructed.\nThus, the Sage does not act for the eyes but for the belly—\nHe discards their false allure, takes the belly’s true use.\n\nVirtue says:\nOf the five colors, only yellow is true to observe—\nBlack and red are false, blinding the eyes.\nOf the five tones, only *gōng* is true to hear—\n*shāng* and *jué* are false, deafening the ears.\nOf the five flavors, only sweetness is true to eat—\nSour and bitter are false, dulling the palate.\nTo gallop in hunts between birds and hares, without measure,\nIs folly that drives the heart to madness.\nTo covet the *lízóng* pearl as rare treasure,\nYet fail to obtain it—reduced to dust—\nWhat harm beyond obstructed conduct?\n\nThin wine surpasses tea,\nCoarse cloth surpasses nakedness,\nAn ugly wife surpasses an empty bed—\nThis is true nourishment of the belly, not the eyes.\nThus, discard the former, take the latter.\n\n---\n\n**The Chapter of Honor and Humiliation, the Fourteenth**\n\nHonor and humiliation are like a shock,\nGreat calamity is like the body itself.\n\nWhat is meant by honor and humiliation?\nHonor is lowly—\nTo gain it is a shock,\nTo lose it is a shock—\nThis is called honor and humiliation like a shock.\n\nWhat is meant by valuing great calamity as the body?\nMy great calamity arises from having a body—\nWhen I have no body, what calamity remains?\nThus, to hold the body as the world’s treasure,\nOne may entrust it to the world;\nTo love the body as the world’s treasure,\nOne may commit it to the world.\n\nThe Classic says:\nHonor and humiliation are like a shock,\nGreat calamity is like the body itself.\nHonor is lowly—\nTo gain honor is a shock,\nTo lose humiliation is also a shock—\nThis is called honor and humiliation like a shock.\nGreat honor lies in the body,\nGreat calamity lies in the body—\nIf one has no calamity, it is as if one has no body.\nIf one holds the body as the world’s treasure,\nOne may entrust it to the world;\nIf one loves the body as the world’s treasure,\nOne may commit it to the world—\nThis is called having no body.\n\nThe Way says:\nThe *jiǔwǔ* flying dragon ascends to Heaven,\nFavorable to seeing the great person—\nLike voices resonating, like *qi* seeking its kind,\nWater flows to moisture, fire seeks dryness,\nClouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger.\nThe Sage acts, and all things behold—\nThis is receiving Heaven’s honor.\nTo align with Heaven and Earth in virtue,\nTo align with the sun and moon in luminosity—\nTo gain this is a shock.\nThe *shàngjiǔ* soaring dragon regrets—\nHonored yet without position,\nElevated yet without people,\nThe worthy in low station with no aid—\nThus, action brings regret.\nMovement generates one *yīn* below, forming *xiù*—\nRegret and blame are symbols of worry and anxiety—\nThus, loss is a shock.\nIf the *jiǔwǔ* does not possess its body as the world’s honor,\nIt must long dwell in *jiǔwǔ*, never reaching *shàngjiǔ*’s great calamity—\nThis is called honor and humiliation like a shock.\nThus, he who holds the body as the world’s treasure\nMay entrust it to the world;\nHe who loves the body as the world’s treasure\nMay commit it to the world.\nThus, without possessing the body, there is no calamity—\nThis is clear.\n\nVirtue says:\nKnow the male, guard the female—\nTo gain this is a shock.\nTo confront the enemy lightly in battle—\nNo greater humiliation exists.\nTo gain and not lose is great honor in the body;\nTo lose and not gain is great calamity in the body.\nWith action, there is a body—\nNecessarily, great calamity follows;\nWithout action, there is no body—\nNecessarily, great honor follows.\nWhen the people are both rich and numerous,\nOne’s own body may be treasured and loved—\nTo benefit the people as they benefit themselves is to treasure the body;\nTo use the people as they use themselves is to love the body.\nThus, the Sage does not dare to hold the body as the world’s treasure,\nYet may entrust it to the world;\nDoes not dare to love the body as the world’s treasure,\nYet may commit it to the world.\nThis is called the noble love of having no body.\n\n---\n\n**The Chapter of the Unseen, the Fifteenth**\n\nWhat is unseen when viewed is called *yí*,\nWhat is unheard when listened to is called *xī*,\nWhat is ungrasped when seized is called *wēi*.\nThese three cannot be forced or questioned—\nThus, they merge into one.\nAbove, it is not bright,\nBelow, it is not dark.\nFaint and indistinct, beyond naming—\nReturning to nothingness.\nThis is called the form of no form,\nThe image of no image—\nThis is called *hūhuǎng*.\nApproach it, and you see no head;\nFollow it, and you see no tail.\nHold the ancient Way to govern the present.\nTo know the ancient beginning is called the *jì* of the Way.\n\nThe Classic says:\nWhat is unseen is not blindness,\nWhat is unheard is not deafness,\nWhat is ungrasped is not slowness.\nThe three—*yí*, *xī*, *wēi*—\nMerge into one, the existence of non-existence—\nThus, they cannot be reached by speech or question.\nAbove, it is not bright,\nBelow, it is not dark—\nPiercing emptiness, round and luminous,\nInternally and externally clear—\nFaint and indistinct, beyond naming,\nYet returning to nothingness—\nThis is called the form of no form,\nThe image of no image—\nThis is called *hūhuǎng*.\n\nThis is called *hūhuǎng*—\nApproach it, and you see no head;\nFollow it, and you see no tail—\nPerhaps it cannot be grasped by form or contained.\n\nTo hold the ancient Dao’s emptiness and nothingness,\nAnd apply it to govern the present’s tangible reality.\nTo know the ancient beginning of the Dao,\nIs called the *jì* of the present Dao.\n\nThe Dao speaks:\nExhaust the principle (*lǐ*), penetrate the nature (*xìng*), and reach the vital essence (*mìng*)—\nThus, when one establishes precepts (*jiè*), one accumulates *jīng* (精).\nAccumulating *jīng* allows one to exhaust the principle.\nFrom precepts arises concentration (*dìng*),\nConcentration preserves the *qì* (气),\nPreserving the *qì* penetrates the nature,\nFrom concentration arises wisdom (*huì*),\nWisdom perfects the spirit (*shén*),\nPerfecting the spirit reaches the vital essence.\nThe three—*yí*, *xī*, *wēi*—\nMerge into one, the existence of non-existence—\nThus, they cannot be reached by speech or question.\n\nThe *yí* (夷), *xī* (希), and *wēi* (微) are the *hūhuǎng* of sight, hearing, and touch.\nAbove, it is not bright—\nOriginally, there is nothing to be bright.\nBelow, it is not dark—\nOriginally, there is nothing to be dark.\nThus, faint and indistinct, beyond naming,\nYet returning to nothingness—\nThis is called the form of no form,\nThe image of no image—\nThis is called *hūhuǎng*,\nSo approach it, and you see no head;\nFollow it, and you see no tail—\nThe nature (*xìng*) thus remains complete and whole.\n\nIf one holds the ancient Dao,\nAnd applies it to govern the present’s tangible reality,\nKnowing the primordial beginning (*tàishǐ*),\nThis is called the *jì* of the Dao.\n\nThe *virtue/power* (*dé*) speaks:\nWhat Zhuàngzì (紫阳) called—\nThat which is seen yet cannot be used,\nThat which is used yet cannot be seen,\nEncountered in *hūhuǎng* yet indistinct,\nTransforming in the boundless and obscure—\nThese are the three merged into one,\nWhich cannot be questioned or reached.\nOnly when one’s cultivation (*gōngfū*) reaches this point\nDoes one naturally know it.\n\nThus, *hūhuǎng* within *hūhuǎng*,\nYet there is something within it;\nBoundless and obscure within boundless and obscure,\nYet there is *jīng* (精) within it.\nApproach it, and you see no head;\nFollow it, and you see no tail—\nThus, it is said to be beyond questioning or reaching.\n\nIf one holds this Dao,\nAnd applies it to govern the present’s tangible reality,\nFirst knowing the great beginning,\nThen one can act—\nThus, it is called the *jì* of the Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage’s Seven Transformations**\n\nThe ancient sage who excelled in cultivation (*shì* 士)\nWas subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,\nDeep beyond recognition.\n\nBecause it was beyond recognition,\nThey forced it into seven forms:\nAt first, hesitant as one crossing a winter river,\nNext, tranquil as one fearing the four directions,\nThen dignified as a guest,\nThen vast as ice about to thaw,\nThen solid as uncarved wood,\nThen expansive as a valley,\nThen pure as turbid water settling.\n\nWho can settle the turbid through stillness, and gradually make it clear?\nWho can endure the settled, and over time gradually give rise to life?\n\nThose who preserve this Dao\nDo not desire fullness.\n\nBecause they do not desire fullness,\nThey can wear out without ever becoming new—\nTheir forms remain unchanged.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe ancient sage who excelled in cultivation (*shì* 士)\nWas subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,\nDeep beyond recognition.\n\nBecause it was beyond recognition,\nThey forced it into seven forms:\nAt first, hesitant as one crossing a winter river (*yù yú dōng shè biān*),\nNext, tranquil as one fearing the four directions (*yú yú wèi sì lín*),\nThen dignified as a guest (*yǎn yǎn ruò kè*),\nThen vast as ice about to thaw (*yāng yāng ruò bīng jiāng shì*),\nThen solid as uncarved wood (*dūn xī ruò pǔ*),\nThen expansive as a valley (*kuàng xī ruò gǔ*),\nThen pure as turbid water settling (*hún xī ruò zhuó*).\nTheir forms undergo seven transformations—\nThese are forced distinctions.\n\nAs for settling the turbid through stillness,\nEnduring the settled to gradually give rise to life—\nWho can attain this?\nThis is the spirit (*shén*) of form.\n\nThus, those who preserve this Dao\nDo not desire fullness.\n\nBecause they do not desire fullness,\nThey can wear out without ever becoming new—\nTheir forms return to the original, unchanging.\n\nThe Dao speaks:\nHeaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed;\nEarth does not speak, yet the five phases (*wǔxíng*) harmonize;\nHumanity does not speak, yet all affairs are complete—\nThus, the ancient sage who excelled in cultivation (*shì* 士)\nWas subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,\nDeep beyond recognition,\nPossessing the Dao of the Three Powers (*sān cài*).\n\nBecause it was beyond recognition,\nThey forced it into seven forms:\nFrom hesitant as one crossing a winter river\nTo pure as turbid water settling—\nA single transformation becomes seven.\n\nSettling the turbid through stillness,\nEnduring the settled to gradually give rise to life—\nSeven transformations become nine.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness,\nThus, they can wear out without ever becoming new—\nNine transformations return to one.\n\nGreat indeed are Laozi’s words!\n\nThe sage said of it:\nIt is like a dragon, is it not?\nI do not know how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend to Heaven—\nYet this is perhaps its limit.\n\nThe *virtue/power* (*dé*) speaks:\nThe sage who attains the Dao truly embodies the four *virtues/powers* (*sì dé*).\nThat which cannot be grasped is called *wēi* (微),\nThe unfathomable yin and yang is called *miào* (妙),\nThe transformations of Heaven and Earth are called *xuán* (玄),\nThe ceaseless coming and going is called *tōng* (通)—\nThus, it is said to be subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,\nDeep beyond recognition.\n\nBecause it was beyond recognition,\nThey forced it into seven forms:\nHesitant as one crossing a winter river—\nThis is cautious yet firm, like stepping on thin ice.\nTranquil as one fearing the four directions—\nThis is not daring to advance an inch while retreating a foot.\nDignified as a guest—\nThis is not daring to be the host, but only the guest.\nVast as ice about to thaw—\nThis is recognizing the heart and seeing the nature.\nSolid as uncarved wood—\nThis is the completion of the *jiǎgēng* (甲庚) cycle.\nExpansive as a valley—\nThis is the opening of the *wùjǐ* (戊己) gate.\nPure as turbid water settling—\nThis is the birth of *qiān cǎi* (铅采) and *guǐ shēng* (癸生).\n\nWho can settle the turbid through stillness?\nThis is the Way of the highest goodness, like water.\nWho can endure the settled to gradually give rise to life?\nThis is the ten-month gestation of the embryo.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao\nDo not desire fullness—\nFullness reveals the spirit and *jīng* (精).\n\nBecause they do not desire fullness,\nThey can wear out without ever becoming new—\nTheir forms remain unchanged.\n\n---\n**The Three Interpretations of the *Zhēn Dé Jīng* (道德真经) – Volume One Complete**\n**#1** Only because it does not dwell,\nIs it not departed: [\"Only

*stillness*—\nThe place where all things rest.\nStillness is called *recovery of vital essence*—\nThe birth of *one yang* at the Winter Solstice.\nRecovery of vital essence is called *constancy*—\nAnother full cycle of heaven.\nKnowing constancy is called *clarity*—\nThe four seasons never err.\nIgnorance of constancy leads the people astray,\nAnd reckless action brings

*constancy*—\nKnowing constancy is called *clarity*.\nIf one knows constancy,\nThey need not exhaust their *jīng* (精) through labor—\nIgnorance of constancy leads them to take recklessness as constancy.\nTaking recklessness as constancy,\nThey drain their *jīng* (精) to depletion,\nAnd scatter their *zhēn* (真)—\nThus calamity follows.\nKnowing constancy, one can embrace all things—\nThis

arises great deceit—\n*Yǔ Tāng* (禹汤) to *Jié Zhòu* (桀纣).\nWhen the Six Kinships are not in harmony,\nThere arise filial piety and kindness—\n*Wén Wǔ* (文武) to *Yōu Lì* (幽厉).\nWhen the state is in

(仁义) arises,\nThe Sage upholds the Five Constants\nAnd defines the *Shū* (书).\nWhen wisdom and insight emerge,\nThe Sage succeeds the Three Kings\nAnd edits the *Shī* (诗).\nWhen great deceit arises,\nThe Sage is the descendant of the Five Hegemons\nAnd composes the *Chūn Qiū* (春秋),\nWithin which are filial piety, kindness, and loyal subjects.\"*\n\nThe *Virtue* says:\n*\"The Great Dao,\nIs the great medicine.\"*\n\n「仁义 (*rén yì*), the graded categories of medicine.\n智慧 (*zhì huì*), the refined methods.\n大伪 (*dà wěi*), the deviant paths.\n\nWhen the great medicine is neglected,\nOne does not lose the graded categories of medicine,\nHence it is said:\n*\"When the Great Dao is neglected,\n仁义 (*rén yì*) arises.\"*\n\nWhen refined methods emerge,\nThere must arise the deviant paths,\nHence it is said:\n*\"When wisdom and insight arise,\n大伪 (*dà wěi*) emerges.\"*\n\nMedicine meets its kindred *qi* and forms its efficacy,\nThe Dao aligns with the *Xīyí* (希夷) and harmonizes with nature—\nWhen the Six Kinships are not in harmony,\n孝慈 (*xiào cí*, filial piety and kindness) arises.\nA single grain of *Jīndān* (金丹, elixir) swallowed into the belly,\nOne comes to know:\n*\"My fate is not governed by Heaven,\"*\nWhen the state is in chaos,\n忠臣 (*zhōng chén*, loyal subjects) arise.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Wisdom**\nDiscarding the Sage and Wisdom,\nThe people benefit a hundredfold;\nDiscarding 仁义 (*rén yì*), the people return to filial piety and kindness;\nDiscarding cleverness and profit,\nBandits and thieves vanish.\nThese three measures,\nAre deemed insufficient for culture,\nThus they are permitted to exist in their own domains.\n\nEmbrace simplicity, forsake excess.\nThe Classic states:\n*\"Discarding the Sage and

bandits and thieves abound.\nThese three measures are deemed insufficient for cultural institutions,\nThus they are permitted to exist in their own domains.\"*\n\nThe Sage and Wisdom,\nAre the domain of the people’s benefit.\n仁义 (*rén yì*),\nAre the domain of filial piety and kindness.\nCleverness and profit,\nAre the domain of bandits and thieves.\nOnly by seeing the Great Simplicity,\nAnd adhering to the Great Primordial,\nDoes one attain a life of few desires and little greed,\nWithout needing cultural teachings to achieve these three outcomes.\n\n**Virtue says:**\n*\"When the Great Dao is neglected,\n仁义 (*rén yì*) arises;\nWhen cleverness and profit emerge,\nBandits and thieves arise—\nThis is because cultural laws are insufficient,\nAnd thus they are permitted to exist in their own domains.\"*\n\nThe Dao exists before the heavens,\nWith neither words nor language,\nNor artificial cleverness and profit,\nThus the Sage and Wisdom,\n仁义 (*rén yì*) naturally arise within it.\nThe teachings of *Zǐyáng* (紫阳, Zhu Xi) that regard\n*\"The cultivation of clever artifices as merit,\"*\nAnd that recognize\n*\"The methods of other schools as not fatal,\"*\nAre based on this principle.\n\nOnly upon encountering the *Sùnǚzǐ* (素女子, plain maiden) of *Tàibái Shān* (太白山),\nAnd embracing the Primordial Simplicity of the preheavenly,\nDoes one naturally attain few desires and little greed.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Discarding Learning Brings No Worry**\n\n「Only *yī* (唯) and *ē* (阿) differ—how far apart are they?\nHow distant is *shàn* (善) from *è* (恶)?\nWhat people fear, one

difference from others,\nFor in the beginning, I sought nourishment from the Mother.\n\nThus it is said: *\"All under heaven are my daughters, the Mother.\"*\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Form of Perfect Virtue/Power**\nThe form of perfect virtue/power follows only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing is but faint and hazy.\nFaint and hazy—\nWithin it are forms.\nFaint and hazy—\nWithin it are essences.\nDeep and mysterious—\nWithin it is the vital essence, most true,\nWithin it is trust.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name never fades,\nTo observe the multitude of common folk.\n\nHow do I know they are thus?\nBy this.\nThe text says: *\"Perfect virtue/power takes form,\nFollowing only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing is faint and hazy.\nFaint and hazy—\nWithin it are forms.\nFaint and hazy—\nWithin it

essence, and trust—\nFaint and hazy, deep and mysterious.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name never fades,\nThus observing the multitude of beauties.\n\nHow do I know they are thus?\nBy this path of vital essence and trust.»\n\nThe Dao speaks:\n*\"When virtue/power is embodied, it is round and divine;\nWhen virtue/power is manifested in the trigrams, it is square and knowing—\nBoth are the interplay of one yin and one yang, thus it is said: 'Only the Dao is followed.'\n\nThe Dao, as a thing, is unseen yet hazy, unknown yet formless,\nUnseen yet hazy, unknown yet containing essence—\nThus, those who practice virtue/power and trust without ceasing\nPerceive the Dao within the depths of mystery.\nHence, from ancient times to now,\nIts name never fades.\n\nTo observe its subtlety without desire,\nEver profound, entering the gate of all mysteries—\nThis is the way.\n\nVirtue/power declares:\n*'When humans study the Dao,\nThere is no virtue/power to contain it—\nOnly the Dao is followed,\nThe vastness of Confucian virtue/power.*\n\nBefore Heaven as a thing, it meets in hazy obscurity;\nBefore Heaven as a form, it appears in hazy indistinctness.\nThe vital essence of Before Heaven is obtained in the depths of mystery—\nIts essence is most true;\nThe trust of Before Heaven is obtained in the depths of mystery—\nIts trust is most enduring.\nThus, from ancient times to now,\nThe names of lead and mercury never fade,\nTo observe the multitude’s nature.\n\nHow do I know their nature is beautiful?\nBy this lead and mercury of Before Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Curved Becomes Whole**\nThe curved becomes whole,\nThe bent becomes straight,\nThe hollow becomes full,\nThe worn becomes renewed,\nThe few become sufficient,\nThe many become confused.\nThus, the Sage embraces *One* as the model for all under Heaven.\n\nNot self-illuminating, hence clear;\nNot self-righteous, hence manifest;\nNot self-praising, hence effective;\nNot self-glorifying, hence enduring.\nOnly by not contending does one surpass all contention.\nWas the ancient saying 'the curved becomes whole' mere empty words?\nTruly, it is whole and returns to this.\n\nThe text says:\n*'The curved becomes whole,\nThe bent becomes straight,\nThe hollow becomes full,\nThe worn becomes renewed,\nThe few become sufficient,\nThe many become confused—\nThe Dao of gain and loss, flourishing and decline.*\nThus, the Sage embraces *One* as the model for all under Heaven.\n\nNot self-illuminating, hence able to enlighten;\nNot self-righteous, hence able to manifest;\nNot self-praising, hence able to achieve;\nNot self-glorifying, hence able to endure.\nOnly this non-contention—\nThus, none under Heaven can contend with it.\nWas the ancient saying 'the curved becomes whole' mere empty words?\nTruly, it is whole and returns to this.\n\nThe Dao speaks:\n*'The caterpillar’s bending seeks truth,\nThe dragon’s coiling preserves life,\nRefined essence enters the divine to fulfill its use,\nUseful application secures life to elevate virtue/power.\nFirst it bends and twists,\nThen it becomes whole and straight;\nFirst it hollows and wears,\nThen it fills and renews;\nFirst it is few,\nThen it suffices;\nFirst it is many,\nThen it confuses—\nThe Dao of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness.\nThus, the Sage embraces *One* as the unifying thread,\nAnd becomes the model revered by all under Heaven.\n\n*One* does not self-illuminate, hence able to use all under Heaven’s clarity;\n*One* does not self-righteous, hence able to use all under Heaven’s manifestation;\n*One* does not self-praise, hence able to use all under Heaven’s achievements;\n*One* does not self-glorify, hence able to use all under Heaven’s endurance.\nOnly this non-contention—\nThus, none under Heaven can contend with it.\nWas this mere empty words?\nTruly, it is whole and returns to this.\n\nVirtue/power declares:\n*'The most straight seems bent,\nThe most skillful seems clumsy,\nThe most eloquent seems tongue-tied—\nThus, softness overcomes hardness,\nWeakness overcomes strength—\nThis is the natural order.*\nZhu Xi said:\n*'Only by turning the door of death into the door of life,\nDo not mistake the gate of life for the gate of death.\nIf one understands the mechanism of killing turned upside down,\nOnly then does one know that harm harbors hidden blessing.*\nThis is the curved becoming whole.\n\nThus, the Sage embraces the *One* of the Supreme Ultimate,\nAs the hidden dragon not yet acting—\nFirmly established, unshakable—\nAnd becomes the model revered by all under Heaven.\nHence, those who self-illuminate are not clear,\nThose who self-righteous are not manifest,\nThose who self-praise achieve nothing,\nThose who self-glorify do not endure.\nOnly these two words—*non-contention*—\nCan traverse all under Heaven without rival,\nThus, the saying 'the curved becomes whole'—\nWas it mere empty words?\nTruly, it is whole and returns to this.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Few Words of Nature**\n...\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Few Words of Nature (continued)**\n---\n\nThe Way of few words and naturalness.\nThe gusting wind does

**Great**,\nEarth is **Great**,\nThe **King** is also **Great**.\nWithin the realm, there are four **Great**,\nAnd the **King** occupies one of them.\nMan follows Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven

**Dao/Way**.\"*\n\n「The human follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows **Dao/Way**, **Dao/Way** follows naturalness—**Dao/Way** is the divine essence.\n\n**Dao/Way** speaks:\n*\"Within the **Supreme Ultimate**'s void (*太极之虚*), there exists a divine substance (*神物*), coalescing in **Primordial Mixture** (*混然而成*), born before Heaven and Earth yet establishing the **Two Principles** (*两仪*). Silent and boundless in the realm of **Non-existence** (*无有之乡*), it emerges as the first among all things (*庶物*), standing alone yet unchanging in its essence (*色*), circulating endlessly without faltering (*周行而不殆*). Indeed, it can be the **Mother of All under Heaven** (*万物之母*), so the Sage names it **Dao/Way** and forcefully calls it **Great** (*大*).\n\n**Great** indeed is the **Primordial Mixture** (*乾元*)! All things derive their beginning from it—thus it unifies Heaven. Clouds move and rain falls, and all things take shape in their forms (*品物流形*). The **Great Brightness** (*大明*) completes the beginning, and the six positions (*六位*) of time are thus formed—hence it is called **Great**.\n\n**Great** means to pass (*逝*), passing means to go far (*远*), going far means to return (*反*), and the **Way** of returning after **shedding and renewal** (*剥反*) is **restoration**.\n\nThus, **Dao/Way** is **Great**—the divine essence has no bounds, and **Ease** (*易*) has no fixed form (*体*). Heaven is **Great**—how can it be spoken of? The four seasons move therein. Earth is **Great**—it follows and sustains Heaven, and all things grow therefrom. The **King** is also **Great**—Heaven created the **primitive chaos** (*草昧*), and it is fitting to establish **feudal lords** (*侯*) yet it remains restless. Within the realm, there are four **Great**—and the **King** occupies one of them, the master of humanity.\n\nThe human follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows **Dao/Way**, **Dao/Way** follows naturalness—this is the **application** (*用*) of humanity.\n\n**Great** indeed are the words of the Sage!\n\n**Virtue/Power** (*德*) speaks:\n*\"Within the **Supreme Ultimate**'s circle (*太极圈中*), there exists a divine substance (*神物*), weighing one **jin** (*斤*) sixteen **liang** (*两*), zero three hundred and eighty-four **zhu** (*铢*), which takes five thousand four hundred and forty years and five thousand four hundred and forty days to coalesce (*结成*). Its form is like a chicken’s egg, its color resembles cinnabar (*丹砂*), its brilliance matches the **radiant sun** (*皦日*), its taste surpasses **sweet dew** (*甘露*). It is born before Heaven and Earth yet completes itself after them. Heaven and Earth obtain it and give birth to all things; the Sage obtains it and gives birth to all people. Though silent and boundless, it stands alone yet does not alter its transformations (*变*), though it circulates fully and begins to act (*启行*), it does not endanger its **manifestations** (*化*). It can be the **Mother of All under Heaven** (*天下民物之母*)—divine, how divine! So the Sage names it **Dao/Way** and forcefully calls it **Great** (*大*).\n\n**Great** means it must pass (*逝*), passing means it must go far (*远*), going far means it must return (*反*)—yet it does not return far. Heaven, in its beginning of creation (*始生*), speaks from above to below, and the **King** is its master as well.\"*\n\nEarth, having completed its formation, speaks from below to above, and the **King** is also its master.\n\nThat which Heaven and Earth generate is the **Dao/Way**. The **King’s** central governing heart is the Sage’s ultimate attainment of principle, nature, and fate.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: \"Heavy as the Root of Light\"**\nHeavy serves as the root of light; stillness is the sovereign of agitation.\nThus, the virtuous person moves all day without straying from his baggage train.\nThough adorned with splendid sights, he rests in serene detachment.\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots bear the weight of the world lightly?\nLightness loses his ministers; agitation loses his sovereignty.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Heavy is the root of light; stillness is the sovereign of agitation.\"*\nThus, the virtuous person moves all day without straying from his baggage train—\nso that the ruler of ten thousand chariots may bear the world lightly without losing his ministers.\nThough adorned with splendid sights, he rests in serene detachment—\nso that agitation may not overthrow his sovereignty.\n\nTo act with lightness is to lose his ministers;\nto act with agitation is to lose his sovereignty.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** says:\n*\"A tree as thick as an embrace begins as a tiny sprout—\nheavy is the root of light.\nPurity and stillness govern all under Heaven—\nstillness is the sovereign of agitation.\"*\n\nThus, the virtuous person moves all day without straying from his baggage train,\nfearing to be burdened by lightness and agitation.\nThough adorned with splendid sights, he observes lightness through heaviness.\nHe rests in serene detachment, conquering agitation through stillness.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots bear the world lightly?\nFor a heavy body is the foundation of lightness;\na still ruler of ten thousand chariots is the sovereign of agitation.\n\nLightness is but branch and leaf;\nheaviness is root and foundation.\nSpeaking of external things:\nWhat originates from Heaven clings to the upper—\nbranches and leaves are above, so lightness is the sovereign of heaviness.\nWhat originates from Earth clings to the lower—\nroots and foundations are below, so heaviness is the minister of lightness.\n\nIf one clings to lightness in action, he will surely lose his heavy ministers—\nthus it is said: *\"Lightness loses his ministers.\"*\nSpeaking of the ruler of ten thousand chariots:\nStillness is non-action; agitation is action.\nIf I act with non-action, the people transform themselves;\nnon-action above, so stillness is the sovereign of agitation.\nIf I act with action, the people fall into disorder;\naction below, so agitation is the minister of stillness.\n\nIf one clings to agitation in action, he will surely lose his still sovereign—\nthus it is said: *\"Agitation loses his sovereignty.\"*\n\nThe **Virtue/Power** says:\n*\"Pure Yang declares:\nThe **Dao/Way** originates from emptiness and non-being, a single breath (*qi*).\nIt generates Heaven, Earth, and humankind—\nall from this vital essence and spirit.\nCreation never departs from the Mysterious Female.\nThe Mysterious Female’s gate is called the root of Heaven and Earth—\nthus, heavy is the root of light.\n\nTrue Yang declares:\nThe wondrous **Dharma** has three thousand six hundred gates;\neach practitioner clings to one as root.\nWho knows the true method of immortality?\nIt lies not in the three thousand six hundred gates—\nthus, stillness is the sovereign of agitation.\"*\n\nThus, the virtuous person moves all day without straying from his baggage train—\njust as the ruler of ten thousand chariots bears the world lightly.\nThough adorned with splendid sights, his mind remains undisturbed.\nHe rests in serene detachment, forgetting both self and environment.\n\nLightness loses his ministers—\nthe foundation is unstable, harming the supreme elixir.\nAgitation loses his sovereignty—\nthe fire’s intensity is excessive, harming the primal yang.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: \"The Virtuous Walk Leaves No Tracks\"**\nThe virtuous walk leaves no tracks;\nvirtuous speech has no flaws;\nvirtuous planning requires no calculations;\nvirtuous closure needs no locks yet cannot be opened;\nvirtuous binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus, the Sage constantly aids people, so none are abandoned;\nconstantly aids things, so none are discarded.\nThis is called *\"inheriting clarity.\"*\n\nTherefore, the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous;\nthe unvirtuous are the resources of the good.\nTo not honor one’s teacher, to not cherish one’s resources—\nthough wise, this is called great confusion.\nThis is called *\"the essential mystery.\"*\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"No tracks are seen—this is called virtuous walking.\nNo flaws are seen—this is called virtuous speech.\nNo calculations are used—this is called virtuous planning.\nVirtuous closure needs no locks yet cannot be opened;\nvirtuous binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage constantly aids people, so none are abandoned;\nconstantly aids things, so none are discarded.\nThis is called *\"inheriting clarity.\"*\n\nTherefore, the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous;\nthe unvirtuous are the resources of the good.\nTo not honor the good as one’s teacher,\nto not cherish the unvirtuous as one’s resources—\nthough called wisdom, it is great confusion.\nTo return to simplicity after confusion—\nthis is called *\"the essential mystery.\"*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** says:\n*\"Spring, summer, autumn, and winter—\nHeaven’s four treasuries—\nthis is virtuous walking leaving no tracks.\nThe *Book of Changes*, *Book of Documents*, *Book of Poetry*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*—\nthe Sage’s four treasuries—\nthis is virtuous speech with no flaws.\nGrowth, decline, harvest, and storage—\nthis is virtuous planning requiring no calculations.\nThe Receptive (*Kun*) conceals it—\nthis is virtuous closure needing no locks yet unopenable.\nThe Creative (*Qian*) governs it—\nthis is virtuous binding needing no cords yet unbreakable.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage aids people with Heaven and Earth’s eternal **Dao/Way**,\nso none are abandoned;\naids things with Heaven and Earth’s eternal **Dao/Way**,\nso none are discarded.\nThis is called *\"inheriting clarity.\"*\n\nWhat is *\"inheriting clarity\"*?\nIf not this, what is it?\nTo not honor the unvirtuous as one’s teacher,\nto not cherish the good as one’s resources—\nthough one may possess great wisdom,\nit is still called great confusion.\nTo return to simplicity—\nthis is called *\"the essential mystery.\"*\n\nThe **Virtue/Power** says:\n*\"Daily practice leaves no tracks to follow.\nOral transmission, heart-to-heart—no flaws to request.\nFollowing the seasons to take what is needed—\nno calculations are used; this is called virtuous planning.\nWithout locks yet unopenable—this is called virtuous closure.\nWithout cords yet unbreakable—this is called virtuous binding.\nThis is the **Dao/Way** of non-action and stillness.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage constantly aids people—\npeople have the **Dao/Way**, so none are abandoned;\n\n常善救物，物有道，故无弃物。\nThus, the Sage constantly aids all things—\nall things have the **Dao/Way**, so none are abandoned;\n\n是谓人物相袭而明，天地之大道也。\nThis is called *\"inheriting clarity\"* between humans and things,\nthe grand **Dao/Way** of heaven and earth.\n\n故善人袭不善人以为资，不善人袭善人以为师，\nThus, the virtuous **inherits clarity** from the unvirtuous as their resources,\nand the unvirtuous **inherits clarity** from the virtuous as their teachers,\n遂使善与不善俱有大得，\nthereby allowing both the virtuous and the unvirtuous to attain great understanding,\n亦不贵其师，亦不爱其资，\nyet neither honors their teacher nor cherishes their resources.\n故人无弃人，物无弃物，\nHence, people abandon no one, and all things are aided.\n智而复迷，迷而复智，\nWisdom returns to confusion, and confusion returns to wisdom—\n是谓妙道之要也。\nthis is called the essential mystery of the wondrous **Dao/Way**.\n\n**知其雄章第二十八**\nThe **Chapter on Knowing

because they have no selfishness? Therefore, they can fulfill their own ends.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao**\nThose who assist the sovereign with the Dao do not use force of arms to compel the world; their actions return to them as they sow. Where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow. After great armies march, there will surely be years of famine. Thus, the virtuous are resolute in the Dao alone, daring not to rely on force. Resolute yet unboastful, resolute yet unvaunting, resolute yet unarrogant, resolute yet without compulsion—this is to be resolute without relying on force. When things flourish, they grow old; this is called *not-Dao*. *Not-Dao* brings early ruin#1.\n\nThe Classic says: Those who assist the sovereign with the Dao do not use force of arms to take the world; their actions return to them as they sow. Where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow. After great armies march, there will surely be years of famine. Thus, those skilled in assisting the sovereign are resolute in the Dao alone, daring not to rely on force. Resolute yet unvaunting, resolute yet unarrogant, resolute yet without compulsion—this is to be resolute without relying on force. Things flourish then grow old; this is called *not-Dao*. If one knows it is *not-Dao*, it is better to cease early.\n\nThe Dao says: Ministers and nobles assist the sovereign with the Dao, not using force of arms to compel the world. The sovereign assists Heaven and Earth with the Dao, not using violent governance to harm beings. The *Tai* hexagram speaks: \"Heaven and Earth unite—*Tai*. The sovereign completes Heaven and Earth’s Dao, aids their natural order, and governs the people accordingly. Thus, those who hold the Dao gain much assistance; those who lose the Dao gain little. When assistance is at its peak, the world follows them; when it is at its lowest, even kin betray them. To attack where the world follows and where kin betray—thus, the virtuous may have no war, yet if they war, they must win, not relying on force.\n\nIf one relies on force of arms to compel the world, their actions will surely return to them as they sow. Where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow. After great armies march, there will surely be years of famine. The Dao of Heaven returns as it sows. When the two *yang* lines are ascendant, reaching the eighth month, disaster is certain. Thus, those skilled in war are resolute in the Dao alone, daring not to rely on force of arms, for relying on force leads to defeat. If one attains resoluteness yet remains unboastful, unvaunting, unarrogant, and without compulsion—this is to be resolute without relying on force. Why? For things flourish then grow old; this is called *not-Dao*. If one knows it is *not-Dao*, it is better to cease early.\n\nThe *De* says: The sovereign is the heart. Those who govern the heart with the Dao hold tranquility and simplicity as supreme, daring not to use the weapons of victory to seize the world. The Great Yang flows with its flavor, longing to depart from humanity, so Heaven unleashes its killing intent, and dragons and serpents rise from the earth. When humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth reverse their course, and their actions will surely return to them as they sow. Heaven shakes, Earth trembles, mountains collapse, valleys split, trees fall, forests crumble, rivers dry, seas exhaust—is this not where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow, and after great armies march, there will surely be years of famine? Truly terrifying! Thus, those skilled in war are resolute in the Dao alone. If one attains the Dao and does not cease, why would they dare to rely on force? Thus, they do not boast, do not vaunt, do not grow arrogant, yet endure as if compelled—this is to be resolute without relying on force. For when strength is used in humility, strength is preserved; if strength is used recklessly, it will meet ruin. It is said: things flourish yet do not cease, they grow old—this is called *not-Dao*. Knowing it is *not-Dao*, cease early.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: The Fine Weapon**\nThe fine weapon is an ominous instrument; beings detest it, so those who hold the Dao do not dwell upon it. Thus, the virtuous in peace value the left, in war value the right. The weapon is an ominous instrument, not the instrument of the virtuous; it is used only when unavoidable, with tranquility and simplicity held supreme. To win yet not take pride in victory—if one takes pride, they delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world. Thus, auspicious matters are honored on the left, inauspicious on the right. The Assistant General stands left, not mastering killing; the Supreme General stands right, signifying a position of dominance, treated with funeral rites. Many are slain, and with sorrowful weeping—thus, even in victory, they are treated with funeral rites.\n\nThe Classic says: To call arms a fine weapon is to speak of an ominous instrument; beings detest it, so those who hold the Dao do not dwell upon it. Thus, the virtuous in peace value the left—life’s side—and in war value the right#2—death’s side. The weapon is an ominous instrument, not the instrument of the virtuous; it is used only when unavoidable, with tranquility and simplicity held supreme. Thus, to win yet not regard it as beautiful—if one regards it as beautiful, they will delight in it, and delighting in it is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing, others will surely kill them; they cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world. Thus, auspicious matters are honored on the left, inauspicious on the right. The Assistant General stands left, not mastering killing. The Supreme General stands right, signifying a position of dominance, treated with funeral rites. Many are slain, and with sorrowful weeping—thus, even in victory, they are treated with funeral rites.\n\nThe Dao says: The army is the multitude. *Zhen* is rectitude. To govern the multitude with rectitude is to attain kingship. When firm yet yielding, moving through peril yet following the natural order—with this, one poisons the world, yet the people follow, bringing auspice. If the people do not follow, what disaster is there? Thus, even the fine weapon is an ominous instrument, much less relying on force! Beings detest it, so those who hold the Dao do not dwell upon it. Thus, the virtuous in peace value the left, for the Emperor emerges from *Zhen*—spring’s birth with benevolence—so auspicious matters are honored on the left. Thus, the Assistant General stands left, the fourth line of the *Shi* hexagram placing the army on the left, treated with auspicious rites. In war, the right is valued, for the *Wang* hexagram is linked to *Yi*—autumn’s killing with righteousness—so inauspicious matters are honored on the right.\n\nThus, the Supreme General stands on the right, signifying a position of dominance, and is treated with funeral rites. War is an ominous instrument, not the tool of the virtuous. When used unavoidably, one must hold to serenity, simplicity, and emptiness as supreme—thus, it is not glorified. If war is taken as a noble pursuit, it will surely become like Qin and Chu, delighting in slaughter. Those who delight in slaughter cannot prevail in the world; their fate belongs to the flames of Han.\n\nThus, though many victories are won, they are mourned with sorrowful tears. Hence, even repeated battles and repeated triumphs are treated with funeral rites.\n\n**Virtue says:** Pure Yang declares: *\"I have three swords to sever the desires of the world.\"* Purple Yang says: *\"First, observe the Five Bandits of Heaven’s clarity; next, examine the Earth to settle the people. When the people are at ease and the nation is wealthy, then seek battle. Only after war’s end may one behold the Sage.\"* This is the finest of war’s instruments, yet still an ominous tool, which beings may detest. Thus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it.\n\nTherefore, the virtuous in peace honor the left, knowing to embrace the yielding while guarding the firm—nurturing the essence of wood. In war, they stand on the right, knowing to embrace the dark while guarding the bright—seeking the essence of metal. Taking must follow the Way; one does not seize by force. War is an ominous instrument, not the tool of the virtuous. If used unavoidably, serenity is supreme. Thus, war is not glorified; to glorify it is to wield a tool of slaughter. Those who delight in slaughter will meet ruin—how can they prevail in the world?\n\nHence, the Assistant General stands left, treated with auspicious rites, while the Supreme General stands right, treated with funeral rites. Those who love strife must know their enemy—how can one be too cautious?\n\n---\n**Chapter 32: The Dao Ever Nameless**\nThe Dao ever nameless,\nThough its simplicity is small,\nThe world dares not submit to it.\n\nIf lords and kings can guard it,\nAll things will come as guests.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nDescending sweet dew—\nNo one commands, yet all is balanced.\n\nWhen names first arise,\nNames already exist.\n\nKnowing when to stop,\nStopping is how one avoids peril.\n\nCompare the Dao in the world\nTo rivers and valleys flowing to the sea.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*The Dao ever nameless,\nThough its simplicity is small,\nThe world dares not submit to it.\nIf lords and kings can guard it,\nAll things will come as guests.*\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth unite,\nDescending sweet dew—\nNo one commands, yet all is balanced.\nWhen names first arise,\nThings already named will know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.\n\nCompare the Dao in the world\nTo rivers and valleys flowing to the sea.\n\n**The Dao says:**\nThe Dao ever nameless,\nIs the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nWhen names first arise,\nIt becomes the mother of all things.\nThough its simplicity is small,\nIt is the constant of the Dao—\nWho dares submit to it?\n\nThus, lords and kings who hold to it\nUpright the world.\nIf they can guard it,\nAll things will come as guests.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nDescending sweet dew—\nThus, the receptive rejoices,\nIts form universally nourishing all things above,\nBringing the benefit of birth.\nWho could attribute this to human effort?\nYet all is balanced.\n\nWhen names first arise,\nNames already exist—\nOne must know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.\n\nThe Dao in the world—\nThough the world is vast,\nAll return to the Dao.\nRivers and valleys to the sea—\nThough many, all flow to the sea.\nLords and kings to all things—\nThough diverse, all submit.\n\nThose who name yet do not know when to stop—\nWhere shall they return?\n\n**Virtue says:**\nIts Dao is ever constant,\nOriginally nameless—\nThe One Qi before Heaven.\nThough its form is small,\nWho dares submit to it?\n\nLords and kings are the masters of the body—\nIf they guard this One Qi before Heaven,\nNot deeming it small,\nThen all affairs and things within the body submit.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth interweave,\nAll things refine into purity,\nMale and female merge their essence,\nAll things generate,\nGathering essence and spirit,\nDescending sweet dew—\nNo one commands, yet all is balanced,\nReturning to the infant state.\n\nWhen names first arise,\nNames already exist—\nOne must know when to stop.\nTo act is perilous—\nThus, it is said: *Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.*\n\nAll things return to the human body—\nLike the world returning to the Dao,\nRivers and valleys to the sea—\nIs it not vast?\n\n---\n**Chapter 33: Knowing Others is Wisdom**\nKnowing others is wisdom;\nKnowing oneself is enlightenment.\nOvercoming others is strength;\nOvercoming oneself is power.\n\nKnowing contentment is wealth;\nPersistent action is resolve.\nNot losing one’s place ensures longevity;\nDying yet not perishing is true life.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*Knowing others is wisdom;\nKnowing oneself is enlightenment.\nOvercoming others is strength;\nOvercoming oneself is power.\nKnowing contentment ensures lasting wealth;\nPersistent action is resolve.\nDwelling without losing one’s place ensures endurance;\nDying yet leaving a name unvanquished is true life.*\n\n**The Dao says:**\nThe Dao within the breast is like a mirror of water—\nAll forms arise and vanish without escaping its reflection.\nWater governs wisdom; knowing others is wisdom.\n\nThe Sage’s Dao:\nConquering the self to restore propriety,\nKnowing the constant to embrace the public—\nPublicness generates enlightenment;\nKnowing oneself is enlightenment.\n\nAuspicious and inauspicious are determined by the steadfast victor.\n\nAs for the strong oppressing the weak,\nThe many assaulting the few—\nOvercoming others is strength.\n\nOne day conquering the self to restore propriety,\nThe world returns to benevolence—\nOvercoming oneself is power.\n\nWealth knows no greater than contentment;\nCalamity knows no greater than ignorance of contentment.\nBlame knows no greater than ignorance of stopping;\nPeril knows no greater than ignorance of stopping.\n\nKnowing contentment is wealth.\nThe virtuous persist without ceasing—they have resolve.\nDwelling in their place without shifting,\nNot losing their place—\nThis is the constant of endurance.\n\nThe **Sixth Five** in *Yù*—auspicious and steadfast—\nThough swift, its constancy endures;\nIts core remains unlost.\nThough lost, yet long-lived—\nThis is the Way of the unending.\n\n**Virtue** speaks:\nKnow thyself, know thy foe,\nA hundred battles, a hundred victories.\nKnow thy foe not, yet know thyself,\nOne victory, one defeat.\nKnow neither self nor foe,\nA hundred battles, a hundred defeats.\n\nThe Way of nurturing life\nMust root in yin and yang’s interplay,\nLight and weight balanced—\nNever erring.\nFirst, know others;\nThen, know thyself.\nWithout knowing, how can one discern?\nIf yin and yang are skewed,\nHow can deeds be wrought?\n\nConquering others lies not in brute force—\nIt has its own logic.\nConquering oneself lies not in brute force—\nIt has no logic at all.\n\nHaving a name, one must know when to stop;\nThus, the contented endure in wealth.\n\nTo persist without ceasing—\nThis is the resolve of the virtuous.\nAdvancing, retreating, waxing, waning,\nDrawing, adding—\nUsing all without losing ground—\nThis is the unending Way.\n\nThough fallen, yet no peril;\nThough dead, yet not lost.\nSitting, life; standing, death—\nForm and spirit both refined—\nThis is the unending longevity.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Great Dao Flows**\n\nThe Great Dao flows—\nIt cannot be confined to left or right.\nAll things rely on it to live,\nYet it claims no credit.\nIts work is done without taking ownership,\nEver without desire—\nThis is called *small*.\nAll things return to it,\nYet it takes no ownership—\nThis is called *great*.\nThus, the Sage never claims greatness,\nAnd so achieves greatness.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe Great Dao flows—\nIt cannot be confined to left or right.\nAll things rely on it to live,\nYet it claims no credit.\nIts work is done without taking ownership,\nEver without desire—\nThis is called *small*.\nAll things return to it,\nYet it takes no ownership—\nThis is called *great*.\nThus, the Sage never claims greatness,\nAnd so achieves greatness.\n\nThe Dao speaks:\nObserve all things through Heaven and Earth,\nAnd Heaven and Earth are but Heaven and Earth.\nObserve them through the Dao,\nAnd Heaven and Earth are but all things.\nThus, the Great Dao flows—\nAll is beyond left or right.\nAll things rely on it to live,\nYet it claims no credit.\nAll things complete through it,\nYet it takes no ownership.\nIts work is done without taking credit.\nEver without desire,\nIt can be rolled up yet never fills the hand—\nThis is called *small*.\nAll things return to it,\nYet it knows no master—\nThis is called *great*.\nThus, the Sage achieves greatness,\nYet never claims it,\nAnd so achieves greatness.\n\nHeaven and Earth set their places,\nThe Sage perfects their functions.\nHuman schemes, ghostly schemes—\nThe people’s power is their strength.\n\n**Virtue** speaks:\nThe Great Ultimate, the Great Dao flows—\nCirculating a million eighteen thousand *li*,\nEncompassing Heaven and Earth’s sixty-four thousand *li*,\nAscending and descending within three thousand *li*.\nApproaching, no sound is heard;\nFollowing, no trace remains—\nHow can it be confined to left or right?\nAll things rely on it to live—\nWhat claim does its Way make?\nAll things depend on it to complete—\nWhat mastery does its Way hold?\nSpeaking of *qi*,\nIts name is small;\nSpeaking of things,\nIts kind is vast.\nThus, the Sage grasps Heaven and Earth’s Way,\nHolds yin and yang’s *qi*,\nMaking one *yuan* a year,\nOne year a day,\nOne day a moment—\nSeizing creation in an instant,\nAchieving great deeds in a breath,\nThen cleansing the heart, guarding the mind,\nRetreating into seclusion—\nThus, the Sage achieves greatness.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Grasping the Great Symbol**\n\nGrasp the Great Symbol,\nAnd all under Heaven will follow.\nFollowing without harm,\nPeace and ease prevail.\nOffer joy and bait,\nEven passing travelers will stay.\nThe Dao’s utterance is bland—\nTasteless, yet profound.\nGazed upon, not fully seen;\nListened to, not fully heard;\nUsed, never exhausted.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe Symbol without form—\nThis is called the Great Symbol.\nGrasp it, and all under Heaven follows—\nWhat harm could there be?\nNot just no harm—\nPeace and ease prevail.\nOffer joy and bait to the people,\nEven passing travelers will stay.\nThe Dao’s utterance is bland—\nTasteless, yet profound.\nGazed upon, not fully seen;\nListened to, not fully heard;\nUsed, yet never fully exhausted.\n\nThe Dao speaks:\nMysterious and vague—\nYet within, a Symbol.\nThe Sage grasps it and acts,\nAnd though all under Heaven follows,\nNo harm is done—\nFor it brings only peace and ease,\nEstablishing its ultimate.\nWithout bias or favor,\nIt follows the King’s righteousness;\nWithout artificial goodness,\nIt follows the King’s Way;\nWithout artificial evil,\nIt follows the King’s path.\nWithout bias or faction,\nThe King’s Way is vast;\nWithout faction or bias,\nThe King’s Way is level;\nWithout reversal or deviation,\nThe King’s Way is straight.\nGathering at its ultimate,\nReturning to its ultimate—\nThus, offering joy and bait to the people,\nEven passing travelers know to stop.\nThe Dao’s utterance is bland—\nNot sweet on the edges or the center.\nGazed upon, not fully seen—\nNot to be grasped by sight;\nListened to, not fully heard—\nNot to be grasped by hearing.\n\nThe Sage takes the symbols of the thirteen *guà* (trigrams), exhaustively gathering and refining their uses,\nTo create perfect instruments for the benefit of all under Heaven—\nThe common people employ them daily without knowing their source,\nThus it is said: *\"Their use cannot be fully exhausted.\"*\n\n**Virtue/power** states: *\"The Great Symbol*—the Dao/Way of the Primordial*—is the Sage’s guide.\nWhen the Sage holds it and acts in the world,\nNo harm shall come—\nThus, those who grasp the Dao/Way\nAre unharmed by blade or saw,\nNor scorched by water or fire—\nWhat harm could they know?\nFor their spirit and form are at ease,\nTheir heart and *qì* (vitality) are balanced,\nTheir nature and life are in perfect harmony.\n\nTherefore, with this Great Symbol,\nThe Sage offers joy and nourishment to all under Heaven—\nEven those with grave transgressions\nTurn back and know to cease.\n\nNow why do they know to hold fast to the Great Symbol?\nThe Dao/Way of the Great Symbol\nSpeaks without taste,\nNourishes without taste—\nGazed upon, it is unseen;\nListened to, it is unheard—\nYet when put to use,\nIts effects are wondrous beyond measure,\nInexhaustible in their power.\n\n**When one seeks to contract**—*Chapter Thirty-Six*:\n**When one seeks to contract,**\nOne must first expand.\n\n**When one seeks to weaken**—\nOne must first strengthen;\nWhen one seeks to discard,\nOne must first exalt;\nWhen one seeks to take,\nOne must first give.\n\nThis is called *subtle clarity*.\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\n\nFish cannot escape the depths,\nNor can a state’s sharpest tools\nBe shown to all.\n\nThe Classic says:\nTo stretch is to contract,\nTo strengthen is to weaken,\nTo exalt is to discard,\nTo take is to give.\n\nIf one would thus attain,\nOne must thus lose—\nThis is called *subtle yet clear*.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nIf fish are rigid and strong,\nThey cannot escape the yielding depths.\n\nThus, a state’s sharpest tools\nMust not be displayed to all.\n\nThe Dao says:\nWithin, clarity and refinement,\nWithout, softness and compliance—\nTo endure great peril,\nAs did King Wen.\n\n*Difficult virtue stands firm*—\nHiding its brilliance.\n\nWithin, turmoil yet steadfast resolve—\nAs did Ji Zi.\n\nThus, the moon, veiled, shines brighter,\nThe dawn, obscured, arrives clearer,\nThe sky, not cold, brings summer’s heat,\nThe earth, concealed, nurtures life—\nThe sovereign power of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAs for eastward labor and westward harvest,\nA hundredfold gain for the people—\nThe people’s sovereign power.\n\nWith some, one may stand;\nWith others, one must yield—\nThe Sage treasures this deeply.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong—\nLike fish and dragons, they cannot escape the depths.\nThis is called *first subtle, then manifest*.\n\nThus, the depths of softness and weakness—\nThe treasures of river and sea—\nMust not be revealed lightly,\nFor revelation brings peril.\n\nStrengthening, exalting, giving, taking—\nThe state’s sharpest tools—\nMust not be displayed to all,\nFor display brings danger.\n\nIf schemes are not kept secret,\nDisaster will surely arise.\n\n*Virtue says*:\nKnow the male yet cling to the female—\nThis is the valley of all under Heaven.\nKnow the white yet cling to the black—\nThis is the model for all under Heaven.\n\nThe Dao is a thief—\nThree thefts are fitting.\n*Virtue* is attainment—\nOne attainment is the measure.\n\nIn essence, cultivation is human effort.\nThough called human effort,\nStillness rules the restless,\nYin and yang must align,\nFire and timing must be balanced.\n\nWhat is weak, discarded, taken away—\nIf held within,\nThen stillness awaits movement;\nWhat is strong, exalted, given—\nIf in others,\nThen movement follows stillness.\n\nThis is called *subtle yet manifest*.\n\nAll things arise from water and return to water.\nWater is supremely soft and weak—\nYet fish and dragons cannot escape the depths.\n\nHumans, at their most rigid and strong,\nCannot escape the *Heavenly One’s* water.\n\nThus, a state’s sharpest tools\nMust not be displayed to all—\nLightly shown, they bring ruin.\nA person’s greatest treasure\nMust not be displayed to all—\nLightly shown, they invite censure.\n\nThis is the sovereign power of Heaven, Earth, and the Sage—\nNot the rhetoric of *strategic maneuvering*.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao/Way of Constant Non-Action**\n\nThe Dao/Way constantly does nothing\nYet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nAll things would transform of themselves.\n\nWhen transformation stirs to act,\nI will restrain it with the *Nameless Primordial*.\nThe *Nameless Primordial*\nWill also refuse to act.\n\nBy not desiring, one attains stillness—\nThen all under Heaven will align itself.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe Dao/Way constantly does nothing\nYet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nAll things would transform of themselves.\n\nWhen transformation stirs to act,\nAnd they do not know non-action,\nI will restrain it with the *Nameless Primordial*.\nThe *Nameless Primordial*\nWill also refuse to act.\nBy not desiring, one attains stillness—\nStillness, and all under Heaven will align itself.\n\nThe Dao says:\nThe Dao/Way is originally non-action,\nIts root is non-desire.\nNon-action and non-desire—\nYet nothing remains undone or undesired.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nAll things would transform of themselves.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun\nWore simple robes,\nYet all under Heaven was governed—\nGoverned through non-action.\n\nWhat need for action?\nOnly reverence and rectitude in the southern face—\nThus it is said: *I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves.*\n\nWhen transformation stirs to act,\nAgain, lest they lean toward action,\nI will restrain it with the *Nameless Primordial*.\n\nThe Dao/Way is constant non-action—\nThe *Nameless Primordial* will also refuse to act.\nTo govern those who desire,\nOne must hold to stillness—\nStillness, and all under Heaven will align itself.\n\n*Virtue says*:\nThe Dao/Way is constant non-action—\nThe pure, still body—\nYet nothing remains undone.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold it with the Dao/Way,\nAll things would transform of themselves.\n\nWhen transformation stirs to act,\nI will restrain it with the *Nameless Primordial*—\nThe *Primordial Medicine of the Pre-Heaven*—\nThe *Primordial Primordial* is not what is desired.\n\nDesiring yet not desiring—\nOnly by holding to stillness\nWill the nature and life of all under Heaven align itself.\n\nThe Dao/Way constantly does nothing yet does—\nThis is true action.\nAction through action\nCannot reach such subtlety.\n\n*The Three Teachings of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic, Volume Two, ends here.*\n\n---\n*The text of \"不道\" originally omitted two characters.*\n*The use of arms favors the right—original text omitted \"兵\" (arms).*\n\n**Volume Three of the *Three Teachings of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic***\n*Narrated by Deng Zui, the Jade Guest.*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: *The Virtue/Power of the Highest Virtue/Power Does Not Virtue/Power***\n\nThe highest virtue/power does not virtue/power—\nThus it has virtue/power.\nThe lowly virtue/power does not lose virtue/power—\nThus it has no virtue/power.\n\nThe highest virtue/power acts without action yet nothing is left undone—\nThe lowly virtue/power acts with action yet nothing is fully accomplished.\nThe highest benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone—\nVirtue/power responds to it.\nThe highest righteousness acts yet something is left undone—\nBenevolence responds to it.\nThe highest propriety acts yet righteousness does not respond—\nThen it rolls up its sleeves and seizes by the throat.\n\nThus, when the Dao/Way is lost, virtue/power arises;\nWhen virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\n\nFor propriety is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust—\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\n\nPreceding knowledge is the superficial bloom of the Dao/Way—\nAnd the start of folly.\n\nThus, the true man of virtue dwells in its depth, not its shallowness,\nResides in its substance, not its superficiality—\nHence he discards that and takes this.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe highest virtue/power does not fear losing virtue/power—\nThus it has virtue/power.\nThe lowly virtue/power fears losing virtue/power—\nThus it has no virtue/power.\nThe highest virtue/power acts without action yet nothing is left undone—\nThe lowly virtue/power acts with action yet nothing is fully accomplished.\nThe highest benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone—\nVirtue/power responds to it.\nThe highest righteousness acts yet something is left undone—\nBenevolence responds to it.\nThe highest propriety acts yet righteousness does not respond—\nHow much less does it respond?\nThen it rolls up its sleeves and seizes by the throat.\n\nThus, when the Dao/Way is lost, virtue/power arises;\nWhen virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\nWhen propriety is lost, it returns to chaos.\n\nFor propriety is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust—\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nPreceding knowledge and prior awareness are the superficial bloom of the Dao/Way—\nAnd the start of folly.\nThus, the true man of virtue dwells in the Dao/Way’s depth, not its superficial bloom,\nResides in virtue’s substance, not its superficial folly—\nHence he discards that and takes this.\n\nThe Dao/Way says:\nThe *Qian* (乾)—\nThe most robust of all under Heaven—\nIts virtue/power and conduct are ever simple, yet it knows danger.\nThe *Kun* (坤)—\nThe most yielding of all under Heaven—\nIts virtue/power and conduct are ever unadorned, yet it knows obstruction.\n\nThe *Upper Classic* (上经) speaks of the constant Dao/Way,\nThe constant name, the *Tai Ji* (太极),\nAnd *Xu Ming* (虚明)—\nThese are the Dao/Way of the Pre-Heaven.\nThe *Lower Classic* (下经) speaks of the highest virtue/power,\nNot virtue/powering, *Qian* and *Kun*,\nAnd virtue/power’s conduct—\nThese are the Dao/Way of the Post-Heaven.\n\nIt is like the *Great Changes* (大易)—\nWhich also has an Upper and a Lower Classic.\n\nThe *Yellow River Master* (河上公) was not ordinary indeed?\nHeaven and Earth do not possess virtue/power of their own—\nThus they possess virtue/power.\nAll things do not lose Heaven and Earth’s virtue/power—\nThus they lack virtue/power.\n\nThe highest virtue/power acts without action yet the four seasons proceed—\nWithout anything to be done, hence it is called *wu wei* (无为).\nThe lowly virtue/power acts with action yet all things are accomplished—\nWith something to be done, hence it is called *you wei* (有为).\nThus, Heaven, Earth, and all things are the virtue/power of the highest and lowly.\n\nMan is but one of all things—\nThe most refined and precious of all things—\nThus he is paired with Heaven and Earth as the *Three Talents* (三才),\nTo oversee all things’ virtue/power of generation and growth.\n\nThe most refined and precious of men—\nThe sage—\nThus he governs the traces of order and chaos across ten thousand ages—\nHence, the highest benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s great virtue/power—\nThe highest and lowly respond to it—\nWhy must there be action?\nTo be reverent and occupy the southern seat is sufficient.\n\nThe age of Yao and Shun—\nThe highest righteousness acts yet something is left undone—\nThe sage takes the *One Qi* (一气) of the Pre-Heaven as his master.\nThe age of Tang and Wu—\nRevolution in accordance with Heaven and response to humanity—\nThe age of Shang and Zhou—\nThe highest has the benevolence of Yao and Shun to respond to it.\nThe highest propriety acts yet righteousness does not respond—\nHow much less does it respond?\nThen it rolls up its sleeves and seizes by the throat.\n\nThus, when the Dao/Way is lost, virtue/power arises;\nWhen virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\nWhen propriety is lost, it returns to chaos.\n\nFor propriety is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust—\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nPreceding knowledge is the superficial bloom of the Dao/Way—\nAnd the start of folly.\nThus, the true man of virtue dwells in the Dao/Way’s depth, not its superficial bloom,\nResides in virtue’s substance, not its superficial folly—\nHence he discards that and takes this.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nA fine merchant hides his wares as if he had none—\nA man of great virtue/power, though his virtue/power is vast,\nHis bearing seems like that of a fool.\nHaving attained the Dao/Way of the Pre-Heaven,\nHe fulfills the virtue/power of the true man—\nClad in coarse hemp yet holding jade within—\nHe does not possess virtue/power of his own—\nThis is called the highest virtue/power.\n\nThe lowly virtue/power holds to virtue/power without losing it—\nComparing it to nature—\nThis is called lacking virtue/power.\nThe highest virtue/power acts without action yet nothing is left undone—\nThe Dao/Way of the Pre-Heaven’s *wu wei*.\nThe lowly virtue/power acts with action yet something is left undone—\nThe Dao/Way of the Post-Heaven’s daily practice.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone—\nIt takes the *One Qi* of the Pre-Heaven as its master.\nThe highest righteousness acts yet something is left undone—\nIt follows the *Fire Candidate* of the *Zhou Tian* (周天) as its guest.\nThe highest propriety acts yet none respond—\nThen it rolls up its sleeves and seizes by the throat—\nThe ignorant do not know constancy,\nAnd recklessly act as tyrants.\n\nThus, when Heaven is lost, Earth arises;\nWhen Earth is lost, humanity arises;\nWhen humanity is lost, things arise;\nWhen things are lost, chaos arises.\n\nFor propriety is but chaos—\nThe thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nPreceding knowledge is the superficial bloom of the Dao/Way—\nAnd the start of folly.\nThus, the true man of virtue dwells in the Dao/Way’s depth, not its superficial bloom,\nResides in virtue’s substance, not its superficial folly—\nHence he discards that and takes this.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: *The Chapter of the Ancient Obtaining of the One***\n\nThose who anciently obtained the One—\nHeaven obtained the One and became clear,\nEarth obtained the One and became settled,\nThe *shen* (神) obtained the One and became refined,\nThe *gu* (谷) obtained the One and became full,\nAll things obtained the One and were born,\nAnd the feudal lords obtained the One to be the steadfast foundation of all under Heaven.\n\nTheir attainment of the One was the same—\nHeaven, without the One’s clarity, would fear collapse,\nEarth, without the One’s settledness, would fear eruption,\nThe *shen* (神), without the One’s refinement, would fear exhaustion,\nThe *gu* (谷), without the One’s fullness, would fear depletion,\nAll things, without the One’s birth, would fear annihilation,\nAnd the feudal lords, without the One’s steadfast foundation, would fear decline—\nThough they were high and noble.\n\nThus, the noble relies on the lowly as its root,\nAnd the high relies on the lowly as its foundation.\nTherefore, the feudal lords call themselves *\"gū-guǎ-bùgǔ\"*—\nIs this not their way of taking the lowly as root?\nIs it not so?\n\nHence, the Dao of the *shù* (数) is without carriage,\nNot desiring to gleam like jade,\nNor to be coarse like stone.\n\nThe Classic says:\n\nThe Way of the ancient attainment of the One—\nThus, Heaven obtained the One to become clear,\nEarth obtained the One to become settled,\nThe *shen* (神) obtained the One to become refined,\nThe *gu* (谷) obtained the One to become full,\nAll things obtained the One to be born,\nAnd the feudal lords obtained the One to be the steadfast foundation of all under Heaven.\n\nTheir attainment of the Way was the same—\nHeaven, without the One’s clarity, would fear collapse,\nEarth, without the One’s settledness, would fear eruption,\nThe *shen* (神), without the One’s refinement, would fear exhaustion,\nThe *gu* (谷), without the One’s fullness, would fear depletion,\nAll things, without the One’s birth, would fear annihilation,\nAnd the feudal lords, without the One’s steadfast foundation, would fear decline—\nThough they were high and noble.\n\nThus, the noble relies on the lowly as its root,\nAnd the high relies on the lowly as its foundation.\nThis is why the boundary of the feudal lords’ self-designation as *\"gū-guǎ-bùgǔ\"*\nIs spoken of as the root of the lowly.\nIs this not their way of taking the lowly as root?\nIs it not so?\n\nThe **Dao** is singular in its essence—\nThus, the *Great Ultimate* is one circle of the Dao.\n\nTherefore, the *Yì* (易) speaks of the *Great Ultimate* (太极),\nWhich gives birth to the *Two Principles* (兩儀),\nThe *Two Principles* generate the *Four Symbols* (四象),\nThe *Four Symbols* produce the *Eight Trigrams* (八卦),\nThe *Eight Trigrams* determine auspicious and inauspicious,\nAnd auspicious and inauspicious give rise to great undertakings.\n\nHeaven, Earth, the *shen* (神), the *gǔ* (谷), all things, and the feudal lords—\nTheir governance is one.\nHeaven, without the One, would surely crack,\nEarth, without the One, would surely erupt,\nThe *shen*, without the One, would surely falter,\nThe *gǔ*, without the One, would surely run dry,\nAll things, without the One to sustain their birth, would surely perish,\nAnd the feudal lords, without the One to uphold their virtue and nobility, would surely decline.\n\nThus, the noble relies on the lowly as its root,\nAnd the high relies on the lowly as its foundation.\nThis is why the feudal lords designate themselves as *\"gū-guǎ-bùgǔ\"* (孤寡不谷),\nTaking the lowly as root—\nIs this not so?\nIs it not so?\n\nTherefore, to focus on the use of many carriages,\nYet count their forms—\nThis is to have no carriages at all.\n\nThe polished brilliance of jade,\nThe rough solidity of stone—\nThe sage does not desire such fixed forms,\nFor the body is but a spoken term.\n\nThus, the sage values its use,\nNot its form,\nResides in its substance,\nNot its surface.\n\n**Virtue** says: The One—\nNo thought, no action,\nThe divine and mysterious attainment of the One.\n\nTherefore, the division from the Dao is called *ming* (命),\nThe manifestation of the One is called *xìng* (性),\nThe transformation through yin and yang, symbolized and expressed, is called *shēng* (生),\nThe exhaustion of change and the completion of number is called *sǐ* (死).\n\n*Ming* is the primordial *qi* of Heaven,\nWithout which nothing exists.\n\nHumans have six yang converging at one head—\nThus, *Kàn* (乾) is the head,\nAnd Heaven attains the One with clarity.\n\nHumans have five viscera gathered in one abdomen—\nThus, *Kūn* (坤) is the abdomen,\nAnd Earth attains the One with settledness.\n\nThe heart is the sovereign of the *shen*—\nAll dharmas arise from it,\nAnd the *shen* attains the One with refinement.\n\nThe *gǔ*’s *shen* does not die—\nThis is called the *Mysterious Mother* (玄牝),\nAnd the *gǔ* attains the One with fullness.\n\nGold and sand enter the five viscera,\nDispersing like mist, like wind and rain,\nPerfuming and nourishing to the four limbs,\nEnhancing complexion and luster—\nAll things attain the One with birth.\n\nThen, when achievements are complete and names are fulfilled,\nThe feudal lord aligns with Heaven and Earth in **virtue**,\nWith the sun and moon in luminosity,\nWith the four seasons in order,\nAnd with the spirits and *shen* in auspicious and inauspicious—\nThis is how the feudal lord attains the One as the steadfast foundation of all under Heaven.\n\nThus, Heaven, without fear of cracking, endures clarity,\nEarth, without fear of eruption, endures settledness,\nThe *shen*, without fear of exhaustion, endures refinement,\nThe *gǔ*, without fear of depletion, endures fullness,\nAll things, without fear of annihilation, endure birth,\nAnd the feudal lords, without fear of decline, endure virtue—\nTheir attainment of the One is the same.\n\nAt first, the most humble things are taken as root,\nAnd the sage is called noble.\nAt first, the most base things are taken as foundation,\nAnd the high is aligned with Heaven.\nThus, the feudal lords designate themselves as *\"gū-guǎ-bùgǔ\"*—\nIs this not their way of taking the lowly as root?\nIs it not so?\nIs it not so?\n\nTherefore, to focus on carriages yet count their forms—\nThis is to have no carriages at all.\nTo focus on the Dao yet count its forms—\nThis is to have no Dao at all.\n\nThus, the sage does not desire\nThe polished brilliance of jade,\nThe rough solidity of stone—\nBut to conceal all uses.\n\nThe chapter of **Return** (反), the fourth movement of the Dao:\n**Return** is the Dao’s dynamic motion,\n**Weakness** is the Dao’s subtle use.\n\nAll things under Heaven are born from *yǒu* (有),\nAnd *yǒu* arises from *wú* (無).\n\nThe Classic says:\n**Return** and **Repetition** (復) are the Dao’s motion,\n**Gentleness** and **Weakness** (柔弱) are the Dao’s use.\n\nAll things under Heaven,\nFrom *wú* arise in *yǒu*,\nAnd from *yǒu* return to *wú*—\nThe origin and the end, returning in cycles.\n\nThe Dao says:\n**Repetition** (復), **Completion** (亨), **Firmness** (剛) returns.\nMotion with harmony brings forth,\nThus, entering and exiting without haste,\nFriends arriving without blame.\n\nTo return and repeat the Dao,\nIn seven days, it returns again.\nThe motion of Heaven—\nDoes it not reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth?\n\nWhen the One Yang returns,\nThe sun aligns with Heaven’s order,\nHeaven’s motion is primary—\n**Return** is the Dao’s dynamic motion.\n\nIt faces firmness yet remains gentle,\nAnd in the midst of firmness, it responds.\nGreat **Completion** with rectitude—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nUntil the eighth month, when there is inauspiciousness,\nAnd the decline is not long.\n\nWhen the Two Yangs reach **Facing** (臨),\nThe moon aligns with Earth’s order,\nEarth’s nature is still—\n**Weakness** is the Dao’s subtle use.\n\n**Small Completion** (泰) goes from small to great,\nAnd **Completion** (亨) brings auspiciousness—\nThis is when Heaven and Earth interact,\nAnd all things are in harmony.\nAbove and below interact,\nAnd their intentions are unified.\n\nWithin, the yang; without, the yin,\nWithin, vigor; without, compliance,\nWithin, the *junzi* (君子); without, the *xiǎorén* (小人)—\nThe *junzi*’s Dao endures,\nThe *xiǎorén*’s Dao declines.\n\nWhen the Three Yangs unite in **Small Completion**,\nThings align with human order,\nThe ruler is born—\nAll things under Heaven are born from *yǒu*.\n\nUntil the tenth month, when *Kūn* (坤) conceals it,\nAnd from *yǒu* arises *wú*—\nReturning to the origin and the end.\n\n**Virtue** says:\n**Shedding** (剥) is when One Yang is above,\n**Return** is when One Yang is below,\n**Decisive** (夬) is when One Yin is above,\n**Meeting** (姤) is when One Yin is below—\n*Kàn* and *Kūn* come and go,\nThe gate of **Closure** and **Opening** (阖辟).\n\n*Kǎn* (坎) is the moon’s water,\nAnd **Return** is the **Middle Male** (中男).\n*Lí* (離) is the sun’s fire,\nAnd **Return** is the **Middle Female** (中女).\n\nThe *Zǐyáng* (紫陽) says:\nThe sun dwells in the *Lí* position,\nYet **Return** makes it female;\n*Kǎn* is paired with the *Chán* (蟾) palace,\nAnd thus it is male—\nIf one does not grasp this inverted meaning,\nDo not presume to speak of the Dao’s profound truths.\n\nAgain it says:\nIf one seeks to reverse the use of the sun,\nThe very dust of the earth becomes treasure.\n\nThus, it is said: **Return** is the Dao’s dynamic motion.\n\n*Bì* (畢) becomes the crow,\n*Fáng* (房) becomes the rabbit—\n*Lí* and *Kǎn* mutually serve as their foundation.\n\nThe **Supreme Virtue** is like water,\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend—\nThus, it is said: **Weakness** is the Dao’s subtle use.\n\nAll things under Heaven arise from *wú* within *yǒu*,\nThus, it is said: *yǒu* arises from *wú*;\nAnd from *yǒu* arises *wú*—\nThus, it is said: *wú* arises from *yǒu*.\nThe interplay of *yǒu* and *wú*,\nThe interplay of difficulty and ease—\nAnd thus all things are **Completed** (既濟).\n\nThe chapter of the **Noble Ones Hearing the Dao** (上士聞道):\nThe **Noble One** hears the Dao,\nAnd diligently practices it;\nThe **Middle One** hears the Dao,\nAnd holds it with uncertain resolve;\nThe **Lowly One** hears the Dao,\nAnd laughs at it—\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nThere are words to establish this.\n\nThe **Dao** is manifest yet seems obscure,\nAdvancing yet appears to retreat,\nSmooth yet aligns with the common,\n**Supreme Virtue** like a valley,\nGreat brightness like a stain,\nAmple virtue like insufficiency,\nEstablished virtue like theft,\nTrue substance like corruption—\nThe **Great Square** has no corners,\nThe **Great Vessel** matures late,\nThe **Great Sound** is faint in voice,\nThe **Great Image** has no form,\nThe **Dao** is hidden, nameless.\n\nOnly the **Dao**—\n**Good at lending** yet self-complete.\n\nThe **Scripture** says:\nThe **Noble One** hears the **Dao**,\nAnd moves to act upon it;\nThe **Middle One** hears the **Dao**,\nAnd holds it as if present, as if absent;\nThe **Lowly One** hears the **Dao**,\nAnd laughs at it—\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the **Dao**.\n\n*\"Establishing\"* means *\"ultimate\"*—\nThus, the **Ultimate Words** say:\nThe **Dao** is manifest yet seems obscure,\nAs when **Heaven** creates the **Grass-Mist**;\nAdvancing yet appears to retreat,\nAs **Thunder** and **Wind** wax and wane;\nSmooth yet aligns with the common,\nFor things gather by their kind;\n**Supreme Virtue** like a valley,\nAs **Habit** fills the **Abyss** yet does not overflow;\nGreat brightness like a stain,\nFor **Use** is hidden yet illuminates;\nAmple virtue like insufficiency,\nAs **Earth’s Way** transforms fullness into flowing humility;\nEstablished virtue like theft,\nAs **Heaven’s Way** diminishes fullness to nurture humility;\nTrue substance like corruption,\nFor **Heaven’s Way** is ever-changing;\nThe **Great Square** has no corners,\nAs **Heaven** enfolds **Earth**;\nThe **Great Vessel** matures late,\nAs **Thunder** and **Joy** unite in the **Younger Sister**—\nThe great purpose of **Heaven** and **Earth**;\nThe **Great Sound** is faint in voice,\nFor **Thunder**, **Wind**, **Water**, and **Fire**\nDo not clash yet converge,\nDo not repel yet reach one another;\nThe **Great Image** has no form,\nFor **Sun**, **Moon**, and stars dwell in **Heaven** yet lack true shape;\nThe **Dao** is hidden, nameless,\nVague and profound, in things yet without fixed name.\n\nOnly this **Dao**—\n**Good at lending**, yet self-complete,\nAs it pushes and borrows with all things,\nAnd thus completes itself as **Heaven** and **Earth**.\n\n**Virtue** says:\nThe ancient **Immortal** spoke:\n*\"A man does not reach the ninth generation before hearing the **Dao**.*\nThe **Noble One**—a man of the ninth generation—\nThus hears the **Dao** and diligently acts upon it.\nThe **Sage** said:\n*The Middle Man and above can be spoken to of the **High**.*\nThe **Middle One**—a man of the world—\nThus hears the **Dao** as if present, as if absent.\nThe **Sage** said:\n*He can be raised or lowered.*\nThe **Lowly One**—a man of one or two generations—\nThus hears the **Dao** and laughs at it.\nThe **Sage** said:\n*The Middle Man and below cannot be spoken to of the **High**.*\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the **Dao**—\nThis is the direct account of its truth.\n\nThe **Dao**—\nThe **Heavenly** and **Earthly** **Yin** and **Yang**’s most genuine **qi**.\nEven the **stupid** and **moving**, the **containing life**,\nAll possess this nature—\nHow much more so in man?\nThe **Heavenly** and **Earthly** **Yin** and **Yang**’s most genuine **qi**—\n**Heaven** and **Earth** blend the **raw** and **cooked**,\nAll things refine into purity,\nMale and female intermingle their **essence**,\nAll things are born.\n\nThe **Pure Yang** says:\n*\"Reflecting on where parents gave birth to me,\nI clap my hands and teach people to laugh—*\nThis is what it means.\"\n\nThus it is said:\n*The most profound mysteries of the world*\nCannot be despised.\nYet at the moment when **Yin** and **Yang** **qi** respond,\nIf in harmony, they form man;\nIf inverted, they serve the **Elixir**—\nThus it is said: *\"The **Changing** is contrary to numbers.\"*\n\nIf in harmony, they form man—\nTen months, the fetus completes, nurturing the elder brother;\nIf inverted, they serve the **Elixir**—\nTen months, the fetus completes, entering the **Sage’s** mechanism.\nThe **Lowly One** laughs at this—\nHe who does not know laughter\nFirst laughs at his parents,\nThen at himself,\nThen leaves laughter to his descendants—\nAnd yet, what does he laugh at?\n\nThe **Mysterious Female Gate**—\nThis is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**—\nThus it is said: *If they do not laugh, it is not the **Dao**.*\n\nThus the **Establishing Words** say:\nThe **Dao** is manifest yet seems obscure—\nHidden in its **Use**;\nSmooth yet aligns with the common—\nRevealed in **Ren**;\nAdvancing yet appears to retreat—\n**Softness** overcomes **Hardness**;\n**Supreme Virtue** like a valley—\n**Weakness** overcomes **Strength**;\nGreat brightness like a stain—\nKnowing **Honor**, guarding **Humiliation**;\nAmple virtue like insufficiency—\nEmbracing **Primordial Oneness**, guarding **Unity**;\nEstablished virtue like theft—\nGreat completion like deficiency—\nIts **Use** is inexhaustible;\nTrue substance like corruption—\nGreat fullness like emptiness—\nIts **Use** is unfailing;\nThe **Great Square** has no corners—\nThings blend into unity;\nThe **Great Vessel** matures late—\nLate attainment brings great advantage;\nThe **Great Sound** is faint in voice—\nThe **Dragon’s** roar, the **Tiger’s** howl;\nThe **Great Image** has no form—\nIn harmony with the **Dao’s** truth;\nThe **Dao** is hidden, nameless—\nDivine and mysterious, reaching ultimate oneness.\n\nOnly the **Dao**—\n**Good at lending**, yet self-complete.\n\nDividing **Yin** and **Yang**,\nAlternating **Soft** and **Hard**,\nThus the **Changing** forms its six positions to complete its chapter,\nAnd **Time** rides the six **Dragons** to govern **Heaven**.\nThe **Way of Heaven** transforms and changes,\nEach rectifying its **Nature** and **Life**.\nGreat indeed are these words!\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Generates One**\nThe **Dao** generates **One**,\n**One** generates **Two**,\n**Two** generates **Three**,\n**Three** generates all things.\nAll things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,\nTheir **Qi** mingles to form **Harmony**.\n\nWhat men detest\nAre the **Orphan**, the **Widow**, the **Childless**—\nYet **Kings** and **Dukes** take them as titles.\nThus, some things are diminished yet gain,\nGain yet are diminished.\n\n「。Great indeed are these words!\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Generates One (Continued)**\nThe **Dao** that men are taught,\nIs also my righteous teaching.\nThe **strong and arrogant** meet no good end.\nI shall take them as my teaching father.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nThe **Dao** generates **One**,\n**One** generates **Two**,\n**Two** generates **Three**,\n**Three** generates all things.\nAll things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,\nTheir **Qi** mingles to form **Harmony**—this is man.\nWhat men detest\nAre the **Orphan**, the **Widow**, the **Childless**—\nYet **Kings** and **Dukes** take them as titles,\nThis is the **lowly**.\nThus, some things are diminished yet gain,\n**Humility brings benefit**.\nGain yet are diminished,\n**Pride invites ruin**.\nThe **Dao** that men are taught,\nIs also my righteous teaching.\nTherefore, the **strong and arrogant** meet no good end,\nAnd I shall take them as my teaching father,\nYet uphold **Softness** and **Weakness** as the **Master**.\n\nThe **Dao** says:\nThe **Dao** is the **Great Ultimate**’s single cycle,\nEntering and exiting, moving and still.\nThe **Dao** generates **One**—\n**Heaven** and **Earth**, the two **Polarities**, each receive **One** as **Odd** and **Even**.\n**One** generates **Two**—the **Four Symbols**.\n**Two** generates **Three**—the **Eight Trigrams**.\nThe **Three Lines** of the **Primordial Heaven**, these are the **true numbers** of the *Classic*.\n**Three** generates all things—\n**Hard** and **Soft** intermingle,\nThe **Eight Trigrams** clash and sway,\nTransforming into **Sixty-Four Hexagrams**.\nThus, all things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,\n**Heaven** and **Earth** mingle their **Qi** to form man,\nAnd **Harmony** is achieved among all things to fulfill the **Three Talents**’ **Dao**,\nMaking man the **Master** of all things.\nWhat men detest\nAre only the **Orphan**, the **Widow**, the **Childless**—\nBecause they are **lowly** and **humble**, men despise them.\nYet **Kings** and **Dukes** take them as noble titles,\n**Humility** brings **honor**, and the **lowly** are **unassailable**.\nThus, what is diminished yet gains,\nIs **nobility** rooted in **humility**,\n**Elevation** founded on **lowliness**.\nWhat gains yet is diminished,\nIs like the sun at noon descending,\nThe moon at full waning.\nThe **Dao** that men are taught,\nIs also my righteous teaching—\nYet they cannot make what is diminished gain,\nOnly long make what gains diminish.\nThus, for learning, it is daily gain,\nFor the **Dao**, it is daily loss.\nTherefore, the **Soft** and **Weak** endure and thrive,\nDiminished yet gain,\nWhile the **Strong** and **Arrogant** perish,\nGained yet are diminished.\nHence I say, I shall take them as my teaching father,\nFor they **do not overstep the measure**.\n**Virtue** says:\nThe **Dao** originates from **Emptiness** and **Non-being**,\nFrom **Non-being** arises **Being**—thus it is called **One**.\nWhere the **Five Phases** do not reach,\nBefore **Parents** were born,\nWhere is man?\nThe **Dao** originates from **Emptiness** and **Non-being**.\n**One** responds to **One**,\nBetween them arises form—\nThus the **Dao** generates **One**.\nThe **Former Master** has said:\nSeizing **Emptiness**’s single point of **Truth**,\nEternal through ages, never decaying—\nMastering **One**, all matters conclude,\nThus **One** generates **Two**.\n**Two** is **Qi**—\n**Two** generates **Three**.\n**Three** is **Nature**—\n**Three** combine to form **One**,\nThen all things may be generated,\nBearing **Yin** and embracing **Yang**,\nNone can resist.\nThe mingling **Qi** to form **Harmony**,\nIs the **Fire**’s **Mastery** within man.\nIf man’s **Fire** **Mastery** is like the **Orphan**, the **Widow**, the **Childless**,\nIt is most detested by men—\nThus the **lowly scholar** hears the **Dao** and laughs greatly,\nWhile **Kings** and **Dukes** take it as a noble title—\nWhy is this?\n**Nobility** rooted in **humility**,\n**Elevation** founded on **lowliness**.\nThings in the world that are diminished yet gain,\nAre those that, when one seeks to **pluck** them,\nMust first be **stretched** taut.\nThings that gain yet are diminished,\nAre those that, before they are **taken**,\nFirst give themselves away.\nNow, the **Dao** that men are taught,\nIs also my righteous teaching—\nYet none can follow me in turning **inversion** into **rectitude**,\nOr **disorder** into **order**.\nAlas!\nThe **Strong** and **Arrogant** meet no good end,\nFor they take **rectitude** as **inversion**,\nAnd **order** as **disorder**.\nHence I say, I shall take them as my teaching father,\nThis is not **false**!\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: The Ultimate Softness of the World**\nThe **ultimate Softness** of the world,\nRides and roams the **ultimate Firmness** of the world,\nWith none able to enter the **Gapless**—\nThus I know the **benefit of Non-action**.\n\nThe **teaching of Non-speech**,\nThe **benefit of Non-action**,\nFew in the world can attain.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nThe **ultimate Softness** of the world,\nRides and roams the **ultimate Firmness** of the world,\nWith none able to enter the **Gapless**—\nThus I know the **benefit of Non-action**.\nNow, the **teaching of Non-speech**,\nThe **benefit of Non-action**,\nFew in the world can attain.\n\nThe **Dao** says:\n**Water**, the **ultimate Softness** of the world,\nGoes nowhere without **nourishing**.\nIn terms of **Qi**, **Water** is the **ultimate Firmness** of the world—\n**Qi** rides and roams in **Water**, thus **Qi** within **Water** must **clarify**.\n**Grass**; the **ultimate Softness** of the world,\nGoes nowhere without **yielding**.\nIn terms of **Wind**, **Grass** is the **ultimate Firmness** of the world—\n**Wind** rides and roams in **Grass**, thus **Wind** upon **Grass** must **subside**.\n**Wind** is **Qi** with **sound**,\n**Qi** is **Wind** without **sound**.\n**Water** is **Qi** with **form**,\n**Grass** is **Wind** with **form**.\nThus it is said, none can enter the **Gapless**.\n**Clouds** follow **Dragons**,\n**Winds** follow **Tigers**—\nWhen the **Sage** acts, all things see,\nThen each follows its **kind**—\nThus I know the **benefit of Non-action**.\nWhat does **Heaven** speak of?\nThe **Four Seasons** follow their **Dao**,\nThe **Sage** reveres himself and faces south—\nThis is the **teaching of Non-speech**.\n**Earth** follows and submits to **Heaven**,\nAll things grow from it—\nThe **Sage** wears simple robes,\nAnd the world is governed—\nThis is the **benefit of Non-action**.\nThus, few in the world can attain it.\n\n**Virtue** says:\nWith **Softness** overcoming **Hardness**,\nWith **Weakness** overcoming **Strength**,\nHow much more so when **Softness** and **Weakness** prevail,\nYet they ride and roam the **ultimate Firmness** of the world!\nKnowing the **Male** yet holding to the **Female**,\nKnowing the **White** yet holding to the **Black**,\nThis is **restraint** in **riding and roaming**.\n**Yin** above, **Yang** below,\n**Yang** flees beneath,\n**Head** and **Tail** are **Martial**,\n**Midsection** is **Cultural**—\nThis is **victory** in **riding and roaming**.\nAdvancing **Fire**’s **Mastery** is like **fighting** on **dangerous ground**—\nThis is **contention** in **riding and roaming**.\nThus, a nation’s **precious instruments**,\nCannot be displayed to the people—\nTo display them is to invite **calamity**,\nTo appear as having yet be **void**,\nNaturally entering the **Gapless**.»\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The Chapter on Name and Body**\n\nWhat is called **\"Strong\"** yet does not meet its end,\nWhat is called **\"None\"** yet does not alter its nature—\nHaving yet being void, void yet having,\nWho understands this **Dao**?\n\nWithout the **Dao** yet acting brings loss,\nWith the **Dao** yet non-acting brings benefit—\nThus I know the benefit of **non-action**.\n\nMotion and stillness unceasing,\nFlesh and sinew as one,\nEssence refined and firm,\nSpirit and **qi** unchanging—\nThis is the teaching of **non-speech**.\n\nMorning **accumulation**, evening **obscurity**,\nNoon **union**, then **return**—\nHeaven’s natural **water** and **fire**,\nCirculating through the **Six Voids**,\nThe benefit of **non-action**.\n\nTo attain this is rare in the world—\nTruly, these words are so.\n\nWhich is more intimate: **Name** or **Body**?\nWhich is more abundant: **Body** or **Wealth**?\nWhich brings greater harm: **Gain** or **Loss**?\n\nThus, to love excessively is to incur great expense,\nTo hoard excessively is to suffer great loss.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,\nKnowing cessation brings no peril—\nThus one may endure long.\n\nThe **Classic** says:\nWhich is more intimate: **Name** or **Body**?\nWhich is more abundant: **Body** or **Wealth**?\nWhich brings greater harm: **Gain** or **Loss**?\n\nThus, to love excessively is to incur great expense,\nTo hoard excessively is to suffer great loss.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,\nKnowing cessation brings no peril—\nThus one may endure long.\n\nThe **Dao** says:\nTo bestow the world yet not feel light,\nAs though it had never been yours—\nTo receive the world yet not feel heavy,\nAs though it had always been yours.\nTo have it as though you never had it,\nTo lack it as though you never lacked it—\nIf you cling to having or lacking,\nEven to give a single hair would stir greedy, vulgar thoughts—\nHow much more so with the world?\n\nOnly the **Five Emperors** could know\nThat the world’s world is not their own.\nThus **Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang** all passed on Heaven’s **cycles**,\nLightly discarding the world as though casting off worn shoes—\nHence, **Body** is more intimate than **Name**.\n\nThe wealth of **Lütai**,\nThe grain of **Jùqiáo**—\nThough much, in a day, the soldiers turn and rebel,\nBlood flows to soak the pestles—\nAll becomes another’s possession.\nThus it is said: Which is more abundant, **Body** or **Wealth**?\nWhich brings greater harm, **Gain** or **Loss**?\n\nThus, to love excessively is to incur great expense,\nTo hoard excessively is to suffer great loss—\nTheir consequences return swiftly.\n\nKnowing sufficiency is constant sufficiency—\nThus there is no disgrace.\nKnowing cessation is constant cessation—\nThus there is no peril.\nNo greater calamity exists than not knowing cessation.\nKnowing sufficiency, knowing cessation—\nThus one may endure long and unceasingly.\n\n**Virtue** says:\n**Name** is **Position**.\n**Body** is **Guard**.\nTo hold **Position** yet not lose **Guard** is **Superior Wisdom**.\nTo lose **Guard** yet not attain **Position** is **Great Folly**—\nAn unchanging principle.\n\nThe **Dao** of men and women, husband and wife—\n**Name** is **Position**.\nThe **Dao** of Heaven and Earth, male and female—\n**Body** is **Guard**.\n\nWhen male and female unite in **precision**,\nAll things transform and are born—\nThis is losing **Guard** yet not attaining **Position**.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth blend in **harmony**,\nAll things refine into **purity**—\nThis is attaining **Position** yet not losing **Guard**.\n\nWhen husband and wife align, they beget mortals—\n**False Man**.\nWhen Heaven and Earth invert, they produce **Elixir**—\n**True Man**.\n\n**False Man** perishes in husband and wife,\n**True Man** endures through Heaven and Earth—\nWhich is more intimate: **Name** or **Body**?\n\nWithin the **Body**, the **Medicine**—\nThree hundred eighty-four **liǎng**,\nOne **liǎng** can suffice—\nCommon **mercury**, one **jīn**,\nYellow or white, yet the **liǎng** is unharmed,\nYellow and white grow ever more.\nYet abandon your **Spiritual Tortoise**,\nGaze upon my **Jawbone**—\nThis **Dao** is perilous.\nWhich is more abundant: **Body** or **Wealth**?\n\nTo take **alcohol** as **soup**,\nTo indulge in **folly** as custom,\nTo exhaust **essence** with desire,\nTo dissipate **True Qi**—\nSome use **metals, stones, herbs, and woods** to supplement it,\nOthers swallow and grasp to aid it,\nRegretting death’s delay—\nWhich brings greater harm: **Gain** or **Loss**?\n\nThus, those who love **Name** excessively\nWill incur great expense in **Body**,\nThose who hoard **Wealth** excessively\nWill suffer great loss in **Life**.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace—\n**Achievement** followed by **retreat**.\nKnowing cessation brings no peril—\n**Timely cessation** is cessation itself.\nThus one may endure long and unceasingly.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: The Chapter on Great Achievement as Deficiency**\n\nGreat **achievement** appears as **deficiency**—\nIts use is unexhausted.\n\nGreat **fullness** seems **empty**—\nIts use is inexhaustible.\n\nGreat **straightness** bends,\nGreat **skill** appears clumsy,\nGreat **eloquence** stumbles—\n**Haste** overcomes **cold**,\n**Stillness** overcomes **heat**,\n**Purity and stillness** are the **norm** for the world.\n\nThe **Classic** says:\nGreat **achievement** appears as **deficiency**—\nIts use is unexhausted.\nGreat **fullness** seems **empty**—\nIts use is inexhaustible.\nThus, great **straightness** bends,\nGreat **skill** appears clumsy,\nGreat **eloquence** stumbles—\nMeaning **haste** overcomes **cold**,\n**Stillness** overcomes **heat**,\n**Purity and stillness** are the **norm** for the world.\n\nThe **Dao** says:\nThe **Heavenly Cycle** completes **365¼ degrees** yet does not reach six—\nVigorous yet unceasing;\nThe **Earth’s** square expanse, a thousand **li**—\nNine yet not ten—\nLife-giving yet unexhausted—\nGreat **achievement** appears as **deficiency**,\nIts use is unexhausted.\n\nHeaven’s **sphere**, a hundred eighty thousand **li**,\nEarth’s **four quarters**, sixty-four thousand **li**,\nThe **fixed paths** of sun and moon, fifty-four thousand **li**,\nThe **Heaven above Earth**, eight thousand four hundred **li**—\nHeaven covers without favor,\nEarth bears without favor,\nSun and moon shine without favor,\nAll things ascend to the **Void City**,\nHide in the **Embrace-Bag**—\nWhen exhausted, they transform;\nWhen transformed, they circulate;\nWhen circulating, they endure—\nGreat **fullness** seems **empty**,\nIts use is inexhaustible.\n\n**Qian (Heaven)**—\nIn stillness, it is **concentrated**,\nIn motion, it is **straight**—\nIf **Qian** is not straight, it lacks **angles**.\nIf **Kun (Earth)** lacks **angles**, it lacks **squares**—\nThus, great **straightness** bends—\nHence, **bending** and **trust** respond, giving rise to **benefit**.\n**Kān (Water)**, master of **wisdom**, generates **wood** in **Zhèn (Thunder)**—\nRoots, sprouts, flowers, fruit—\nNone are unclean or disordered—\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend—\nThus, great **skill** appears clumsy.\n\nThe **Way** unfolds without governance, yet the four seasons march in order,\nGreat eloquence seems slow of speech—\nThe **virtuous person** desires to be slow in words yet swift in deeds.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat—\nThis is the inevitable **principle**.\n\nThus, the **Sage** ever preserves the **Dao** of **clearing and stillness**,\nTaking it as the **rectification** for all under heaven.\n\n**Virtue** speaks:\nThe body gathers its **great completion**,\nDaring not to be full—\nCirculating through the **Six Jia**, meeting the **Fighter**,\nUpper crescent lacks gold—its use is not exhausted,\nLower crescent lacks silver—its use is not renewed.\n\n**Great surging, great fullness**—\nSun and moon face heaven and earth—**Qian**.\n**Unworn, unexhausted**—\nSun and moon meet in heaven and earth—**Kun**.\n\n**Great straightness** bends—\nThe inchworm’s bending seeks **trust**.\n**Great skill** seems clumsy—\nCreation nurtures all things, yet clings to **Oneness**.\n**Great eloquence** seems slow—\nTranscending past and present, daring not to speak.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold—**Fire and Water** yet unfulfilled.\nStillness overcomes heat—**Water and Fire** fulfilled.\n**Clearing and stillness** are the **rectification** for all under heaven,\nForm and spirit both refined—harmonizing with **True Dao**.\n\n**Chapter 46: The World in Harmony**\nWhen the **Way** prevails, warhorses are turned to plow.\nWhen the **Way** decays, warhorses breed in the suburbs.\nNo guilt is greater than **desire**,\nNo calamity greater than **not knowing contentment**,\nNo blame greater than **grasping what is desired**.\n\nThus, **knowing contentment** is **constant contentment**.\n\nThe **Classic** says:\nWhen the **Way** prevails, warhorses are turned to plow the fields.\nWhen the **Way** decays, warhorses breed in the suburbs.\nSeeing what is desirable yet taking it—no guilt is greater.\nSeeing sufficiency yet not knowing it—no calamity is greater.\nTaking what is desirable—no blame is greater.\nThus, **knowing contentment** is **constant contentment**.\n\nThe **Way** says:\n**Tang and Wu** revolutionized, conforming to **Heaven** and responding to **humanity**,\nWhen the world was at great peace, horses were returned to the southern slopes of **Hua Mountain**,\nCattle were released into the **Peach Grove** wilds—\nWarhorses turned to plow.\n\nIn the **Spring and Autumn** era, the **Way** decayed,\nRites, music, and conquests issued from the feudal lords,\nThe **Four Barbarians** invaded the **Central States**,\nWarhorses bred in the suburbs.\n\nThe **Five Hegemons** feigned **benevolence** through force—\nNo guilt greater than **desire**.\nA finger in a boat can be grasped—\nNo calamity greater than **not knowing contentment**.\nBorrowing the **Way** from **Yu** to attack **Guo**—\nNo blame greater than **grasping what is desired**.\nThus it is said: **knowing contentment** is **constant contentment**.\n\n**Virtue** says:\nWhen the **Way** prevails, the body completes its affairs.\n**Qian-yang** as horse—vigorous yet unceasing.\nTrue lead, true mercury refined into **pure yang**,\nEmbrace **Oneness**, guard **Unity**, solidify the foundation—\nWhen the **Way** prevails, warhorses are turned to plow.\nWhere the master lingers, brambles grow—\nAfter great armies, famine follows—\nWhen the **Way** decays, warhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nIf one sees what is desirable, the mind is disordered—\nNo guilt is greater.\n**Knowing contentment** brings no disgrace,\n**Knowing restraint** brings no peril—\nNot knowing restraint—no calamity is greater.\n**Purple Yang** says:\nIf not through accumulated **virtue** and cultivated **hidden merit**,\nEvery action invites **demons** to obstruct.\nSeeing the **True Medicine** yet desiring it—\nNo blame is greater.\nThus it is said: **knowing contentment** is **constant contentment**.\n\n**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**\nNot leaving the door, yet knowing all under heaven;\nNot peering through the window, yet seeing **Heaven’s Way**.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus, the **Sage** knows without traveling, names without seeing, accomplishes without doing.\n\nThe **Classic** says:\nNot leaving the door, yet knowing all under heaven;\nNot peering through the window, yet seeing **Heaven’s Way**.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus, the **Sage** knows without further travel,\nNames without needing to see,\nAccomplishes without action.\n\nThe **Way** says:\nThe **Sage** exhausts **principle**, fulfills **nature**, reaching even **fate**—\nWhat ears and eyes cannot perceive, by **principle** it is deduced,\nThus, a thousand-year calendar may be achieved while seated.\nThe more the mind strays, the less it knows.\nMastering **Oneness**, all affairs are complete.\nThus, the **Sage** shuts the **Four Gates**, opens the **Four Eyes**, penetrates the **Four Hearings**,\nTaking all under heaven’s **knowing** as **knowing**, yet not acting,\nTaking all under heaven’s **name** as **name**, yet not revealing,\nTaking all under heaven’s **accomplishment** as **accomplishment**, yet not doing.\n\n**Virtue** says:\nSitting is **establishment**, standing is **extinction**—\nHow could one leave the door if unaware of all under heaven?\nEntering and exiting unobstructed—\nHow could one peer through the window if unaware of **Heaven’s Way**?\nThus, **virtue’s** perfection is **round** and **spiritual**—\nThe **spirit** knows no bounds—\nThe farther it goes, the nearer it returns.\n**Knowledge** of **knowledge**—\nThe less it knows, the more it grasps.\nThus, the **Sage** gazes upward and downward,\nKnows without traveling, names without seeing.\nBefore plows and boats, taking from the **thirteen trigrams’** symbols,\nAccomplishes without doing.\n\n**Master Kang** says:\nEars and eyes bright—yet the body remains poor.\nThe **Great Balance** has not fully bestowed.\nMust explore the **Moon’s Cavern** to know things,\nBefore ascending the **Heavenly Root** to recognize **humanity**.\nWhen **Qian** meets **Xun**, observe the **Moon’s Cavern**,\nWhen **Earth** encounters **Xiao**, see the **Heavenly Root**.\nBetween the **Heavenly Root** and **Moon’s Cavern**, freely roam—\nThirty-six palaces, all spring.\n\nAgain:\nThe **Heavenly Heart** returns to **Non-heart**,\nThe **heart** seeks it in vain at all times.\nIf one says **Non-heart** means **no affairs**,\nWhy does **gold** arise from **water**?\n\nAgain:\nFleeing to **Wu** and **Yue** to seek the **Azure Sky**,\nYet unaware—**Heaven** is before one’s eyes.\n**Master Yao**’s **knowing** still did not require leaving the door or peering through the window—\nHow much more so for the **Sage**?\n\n**Chapter 48: Daily Learning**\nDaily learning increases,\nDaily **Dao** decreases.\nDecrease it again, decrease it again,\nUntil **non-action**—\n**Non-action**, yet nothing remains undone.\n\nThus, to take the realm,\nOne must act with **non-action**—\nYet when action arises,\nIt proves insufficient to take the realm.\n\nThe **Classics** say:\n*\"To learn is to daily increase,\nTo cultivate the **Dao** is to daily decrease.\nDecrease again, decrease again,\nUntil **non-action**—\n**Non-action**, yet nothing remains undone.\"*\n\nThose who can take the realm\nMust act with **non-action**—\nYet when action arises,\nIt proves insufficient to take the realm.\n\nThe **Dao** says:\n*\"Daily know what you lack,\nMonthly forget not what you possess—\nThis is daily learning.\nOne day, restrain yourself and return to **ritual**,\nAnd the realm will turn toward **virtue**—\nThis is daily decreasing in **Dao**.\"*\n\nLearning and **Dao**, though not separate,\nAre yet far apart.\nTo enter the **Dao**, one must first learn—\nWithout learning, one knows not the **Dao**,\nHence it is said: *\"To learn is to daily increase.\"*\nYet when one reaches the **Dao**,\nLearning is inherently nonexistent—\nIf one still clings to learning as master,\nIt will only harm the **Dao**.\nOne must decrease what is learned\nBefore entering the **Dao**,\nHence it is said: *\"To cultivate the **Dao** is to daily decrease.\"*\n\nIs it merely daily decreasing?\nDecrease again, decrease again,\nUntil **self** and **all** are exhausted—\nOnly then does one reach **non-action**.\n**Non-action**, yet nothing remains undone.\nWhen the **Dao** of the realm is attained,\nWhat further need is there for action?\n\nThus, the **Sage** takes all that can be done,\nEver maintaining **non-action** in body and mind,\nAnd finds fulfillment within.\nYet when action arises,\nIt is seized upon—\nAnd yet it remains insufficient to take the realm.\n\n**Virtue** says:\n*\"Daily use money and shoes—\nThis is daily learning.\nMysterious **non-action**—\nThis is daily decreasing in **Dao**.*\nThe **Mysterious Law** has three thousand six hundred gates—\nLearners cling to one as root—\nThis is daily learning.\nWho knows the slightest **Dao** of the **Immortal**,\nNot found in the three thousand six hundred gates—\nThis is daily decreasing in **Dao**.\nDecrease again, decrease again,\nUntil **non-action**—\n**Non-action**, not *not-doing*,\nBut **non-action** while doing—\nGreat doing indeed.\nThus, to take the realm, one must act with **non-action**.\n\nTo cure before illness arises—\nIllness cannot be cured.\nWhen sickness has formed and is treated,\nWhen disease has formed and is attacked—\nIt is like digging a well when already thirsty.\nIs this not too late?\nHence it is said:\nWhen action arises,\nIt proves insufficient to take the realm.\n\n---\n**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Constant Heart**\n\nThe **Sage** has no constant heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as his own.\nThe good, I also make good;\nThe ungood, I also make good—\n**Virtue** is thus good.\nThe trustworthy, I also trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\n**Virtue** is thus trustworthy.\n\nThe **Sage** in the realm,\nEver blending hearts with the people,\nWhile the people fix their ears and eyes,\nThe **Sage** treats them all as infants.\n\nThe **Classics** say:\n*\"The **Sage** has no constant heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as his own.\nThus, the good, I also make good;\nThe ungood, I also make good—\nMy **virtue** is good.\nThe trustworthy, I also trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nMy **virtue** is trustworthy.\nThe **Sage** in the realm,\nLong maintaining **incarnate reverence**,\nEver blending hearts with the people,\nWhile the people fix their ears and eyes,\nThe **Sage** treats them all as infants.\"*\n\nThe **Dao** says:\n*\"Shun plowed, tilled, made pottery, and fished,\nYet even as **Emperor**, he took all goodness from the people.\nYu said:\n'I survey the realm—\nEven a foolish man or woman\nCould surpass me.'\nThus, the **Sage** has no constant heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as his own.\nThe good, I also make good—\nThis is already good.\nThe ungood, I also make good—\nWhat does this mean?\nIf they are taught and transformed,\nHow do we know they will not become good?\nThus it is said: *My **virtue** is good.*\nThe trustworthy, I also trust—\nThis is already trustworthy.\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nWhat does this mean?\nIf they are taught and transformed,\nHow do we know they will not become trustworthy?\nThus it is said: *My **virtue** is trustworthy.*\n\nTherefore, the **Sage** in the realm,\nLong maintaining **incarnate reverence**,\nEver blending hearts with the people.\n**Emperor Yao** was serene and reverent,\nProfoundly respectful and yielding,\nHis radiance extending to all quarters,\nHis harmony reaching above and below—\nThus the people gazed upon him like the sun and moon,\nRegarded him as parents,\nAll fixing their ears and eyes\nTo hear of the realm’s governance.\nThe **Sage** also cherishes them as infants,\nViewing them as if wounded—\nHence it is said: *He treats them all as infants.*\n\n**Virtue** says:\n*\"The **Sage** is the master of **Spirit**.\nThe constant heart is **Spirit**.\nThe people are the **zang-fu** organs.\nAs the five **zang** organs each have **Spirit**,\nThe heart governs them.\nAs the five **zang** organs each have **essence**,\nThe kidneys store them.\nThe **Sage**, having no constant heart,\nTakes the hearts of the people as his own—\nThus he attains mastery over **Spirit**,\nHence it is said:\n*'Without thought, without action,\n**Spirit** is mysterious and governance unified,\nTrue **qi** harmoniously ascends—\n**Spirit** governs it.\nTrue **qi** is obstructed—\n**Spirit** also governs it.\nThus, when **Spirit** is balanced, the heart is harmonious;\nWhen the heart is balanced, **qi** is harmonious;\nWhen **qi** is harmonious, the four **symbols** and five **phases**,\nThe nine **orifices** and three **vital gates**\nGenerate and restrain each other,\nAll finding their proper place—\nHence it is said:\n*\"Eat in season, the hundred bones are orderly;\nStir the **mechanism**, ten thousand transformations are at ease.\"*\nIs this not what is meant?\n\nThe beneficial **qi**, I also treat well;\nThe unbeneficial **qi**, I also treat well—\nMy **virtue** treats it well.\nThe unbeneficial **qi**—\nWhat further need is there?\nIt must also be treated well.\nTrust and distrust are likewise so.\n\nThe **Sage** in the realm,\n**Spirit** and **humanity** in the heart—\nUnsettled yet settled,\n**Non-action** yet doing—\nThus he attains settledness and **non-action**.\n\nWhen **true qi** arrives beneficially,\nMy **virtue** follows and treats it well;\nWhen **true qi** arrives unbeneficially,\nMy **virtue** harmonizes and treats it well—\nThis is also treating it well.\nTrust and distrust are likewise so.\n\nThe **Sage** blends his heart with the realm,\n**Spirit** and **humanity** blend their **qi** with the five **zang**,\nThe people fix their ears and eyes,\nThe five **zang** unify their nature—\nThe **Sage** treats them all as infants,\nNurturing the body as an infant—\nRich indeed are these words!\"\n\nShun ruled the realm,\nSelected from the masses,\nAnd elevated **Gao Yao**—\nThen the unvirtuous were distant indeed.\n\nTang ruled the realm,\nSelected from the masses,\nAnd elevated **Yi Yin**—\nThen the unvirtuous were distant indeed.\n\nWith the unvirtuous now distant,\nHow could there not be peace and tranquility?\n\n**Chapter Fifty: Life and Death**\n\nLife and death are but two paths—\nThirteen parts of ten lead to life,\nThirteen parts of ten lead to death,\nAnd thirteen parts of ten bring humanity into perilous grounds of death.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the **Dao**’s abundant nurturing of life.\n\nIt is said that those who skillfully cultivate life\nWalk upon land without encountering **rhi** or **tiger**,\nEnter battle without being struck by armor or weapons.\n\nThe **rhi** finds no place to lodge its horns,\nThe **tiger** finds no place to set its claws,\nThe weapons find no place to hold their blades.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there are no grounds of death.\n\nThe **Classics** state:\nTo go forth is to live,\nTo enter is to die.\nOf those who live by the **Dao**’s nurturing, thirteen parts of ten thrive,\nOf those who die by their own doing, thirteen parts of ten perish,\nAnd thirteen parts of ten bring humanity into perilous grounds of death.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the **Dao**’s abundant nurturing of life.\n\nIt is said that those who excel in the **Dao** of nurturing life\nWalk upon land without encountering **rhi** or **tiger**,\nEnter battle without being struck by armor or weapons.\n\nThus, the **rhi** has no place to lodge its horns,\nThe **tiger** has no place to set its claws,\nThe weapons have no place to hold their blades.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause the **Dao** contains no grounds of death.\n\nThe **Dao** speaks:\nHeaven is the realm where thirteen parts of ten thrive,\nEarth is the realm where thirteen parts of ten perish,\nAnd humanity, when stirred into motion, also falls into thirteen parts of ten grounds of death.\n\nTo go forth is to live,\nTo enter is to die.\nLife is the root of death,\nDeath is the root of life—\nThis is the **Dao** of returning to origins and completing the cycle.\n\nHeaven and Earth as one, a single cycle of **129,600 years**.\nHeaven has ten **Gān** (heavenly stems), from **Jiǎ** to **Gēng**, seven positions totaling **97,200 years**—Heaven’s life-number.\n**Xīn, Rén, and Guǐ**, three positions totaling **38,810 years**—Heaven’s death-number.\nThus, thirteen parts of ten thrive.\n\nEarth has twelve **Zhī** (earthly branches). From the summer solstice, **Yín** to **Xū**, nine positions totaling **97,200 years**—Earth’s life-number.\n**Hài, Zǐ, and Chǒu**, three positions totaling **32,400 years**—Earth’s death-number.\nThus, thirteen parts of ten perish.\n\nTwelve multiplied by nine—also seven parts of ten.\nHeaven and Earth in one year, **360 days**, from **Kāiwù Yín** to **Bìwù Xū**, **270 days**—Earth’s life-number.\n**Hài, Zǐ, Chǒu**, three months, **90 days**—Earth’s death-number.\n\n**Qián** and **Kūn**’s cycles, **360 days** in total—\nFrom **Jiǎ** to **Gēng**, **252 days**—Heaven’s life-number.\n**Xīn, Rén, Guǐ**, three positions, **108 days**—Heaven’s death-number.\nThus, it is said: thirteen parts of ten thrive, thirteen parts of ten perish.\n\n**Kāng Jié** said: The exchange of Heaven and Earth, thirteen parts of ten—this is precisely it.\n**Kūn**’s number is **108**, now used by the **Buddhist School** in studies of day and night.\n\nHuman day and night, **100 kè**, totaling **13,500 breaths**,\nSubtracting **4 kè** of decay, leaving **12,960 breaths**.\nFrom **Yín** to **Xū**, **9,720 breaths**—human life-number.\n**Hài, Zǐ, Chǒu**, three times, **3,240 breaths**—human death-number.\nThus, it is said: humanity’s motion into grounds of death is also thirteen parts of ten.\n\n**Kāng Jié** said: Heaven does not rest in winter and spring, yet cannot nurture life;\nHumanity does not rest in night and day, yet cannot discern affairs.\nThus, one must not move at night—\nTo move is to enter grounds of death.\nWhy dare one move?\nBecause of the **Dao**’s abundant nurturing of life.\n\nIt is said that those who excel in nurturing life\nWalk upon land without encountering **rhi** or **tiger**—\nUnmatched beneath the heavens.\n**Zǐyáng** said:\n*\"Dragging a white tiger home to raise,\nIt bears a pearl like the full moon’s glow.\nIf not encountered, then well—\nIf encountered, it serves one’s purpose—what harm?\"*\n\nEnter battle without being struck by armor or weapons—\nThe noble one at rest values the left,\nIn battle values the right.\nNot occupying the right—what harm is there?\nThe utmost softness traverses the utmost firmness.\n\nThe **rhi** is yet more fierce than the tiger, with horns and head.\nThough the **rhi** has horns, it finds no place to lodge them;\nThough the tiger has claws, it finds no place to set them;\nThough weapons have blades, they find no place to hold them.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there are no grounds of death.\n\nWithout death-city—\nThis is called a well-closed gate with no key yet unopenable,\nA well-bound knot with no cord yet unsolvable.\nIs there any space between grounds of death?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One of the *Dao* that Generates:**\nThe **Dao** generates it,\n**Virtue** nurtures it,\nThings take form from it,\nCircumstances complete it—\nThus, all things do not fail to honor the **Dao** and revere **virtue**.\n\nThe **Dao**’s eminence, **virtue**’s nobility—\nNone command them, yet they persist naturally.\n\nThus, the **Dao** generates, nurtures, lengthens, and matures it,\nFosters and shelters it.\nTo generate without possession,\nTo act without control,\nTo lengthen without domination—\nThis is called **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\nThe **Classics** say:\nThe **Dao** of Heaven generates it,\nThe **virtue** of Earth nurtures it,\nThe **Creator** shapes it,\nThe **moment** completes it—\nThus, all things do not fail to honor the **Dao** and revere **virtue**.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One of the *Dao* that Generates (Continued):**\nThus, the **Dao**’s eminence, **virtue**’s nobility—\nNone command them, yet they persist naturally.\n\nHence, the **Dao** and **virtue** generate and nurture it,\nThe **Creator** lengthens and fosters it,\nCircumstances complete and mature it,\nThe sun and moon nourish and shelter it.\nTo generate without claiming it as mine,\nTo act without relying upon it,\nTo lengthen without ruling it—\nThis is called **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\nThe **Dao** speaks:\nThe **Dao** is called *that which generates things*.\n**Virtue** is called *that which nurtures things*.\nThings are called *that which takes form*.\nCircumstances are called *that which completes things*.\nThus, all things do not fail to honor the **Dao** and revere **virtue**.\n\nGreat is the **Primordial of Heaven (乾元)**,\nThe origin from which all things arise,\nUnifying the heavens.\nClouds move, rain descends,\nAll creatures manifest their forms.\nThe **Dao** of Heaven transforms and changes,\nEach returning to its proper nature and destiny.\n\nThe **Dao** is called *that which generates things*.\nSupreme is the **Primordial of Earth (坤元)**,\nThe source from which all things are nourished,\nObediently following Heaven.\nEarth’s thickness bears all things,\nIts **virtue** boundless and unending.\nIt embraces and illuminates the vast,\nAll creatures flourish in harmony.\n**Virtue** is called *that which nurtures things*.\nThunder and rain strike—\nAll fruits, grasses, and trees crack and split.\nThings are called *that which takes form*.\n**Fui (兑)** is the true autumn—\nAll things rejoice in **Fui**.\nCircumstances are called *that which completes things*.\n\nThus, the **Dao**’s eminence, **virtue**’s nobility—\nNone command them, yet they persist naturally.\nWhy so? Because they generate and nurture,\nLengthen and foster,\nComplete and mature,\nNourish and shelter.\n\nThus, the Sage generates without possession,\nActs without reliance,\nLengthens without domination—\nFor this is the **Mysterious Virtue** of Heaven’s profound **power**.\nWhat has it to do with me?\nHence it is called **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\n**Virtue** speaks:\n**Qian (乾)** is Heaven, thus called *Father*,\nAnd it generates the three daughters—**Xun (巽)**, **Li (离)**, **Fui (兑)**.\n**Kun (坤)** is Earth, thus called *Mother*,\nAnd it contains the three sons—**Zhen (震)**, **Kan (坎)**, **Gen (艮)**.\n**Qian** and **Kun** stretch vertically,\nWhile the six children lie horizontally—\nWithin them form the things of thunder, wind, water, fire, mountain, and marsh.\nWithin them complete the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\nThus all things arise together,\nNone failing to honor the **Dao** and revere **virtue**.\n\nMaster Zhu Xi says:\nFirst, take **Qian** and **Kun** as the cauldron,\nThen add the black hare elixir to refine.\nOnce the two substances return to the Yellow **Dao**,\nHow could the Golden Elixir fail to manifest?\n\nThus, the **Dao**’s eminence, **virtue**’s nobility—\nNone command them, yet they persist naturally.\nHence, the **Dao** of **Qian** generates,\nThe **virtue** of **Kun** nurtures,\n**Zhen** and **Xun** lengthen and foster,\n**Kan** and **Li** complete and mature,\n**Gen** and **Fui** nourish and shelter—\nAll under Heaven’s affairs are fulfilled.\n\nThus, the Sage generates without possession,\nLater completing Heaven and Earth’s **Dao** with wealth;\nActs without reliance,\nFor when I do nothing, the people transform themselves;\nLengthens without domination,\nFor I am the sovereign of the ancestral altars.\nHence it is called **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Two of the *Dao* that Begins All Under Heaven:**\nAll under Heaven has a beginning,\nAnd it is called the *Mother of all under Heaven*.\nHaving obtained its Mother,\nOne knows its children.\nHaving known its children,\nOne returns to guard its Mother—\nThus, one’s life is never in peril.\n\nClose **Fui** and shut its gate,\nAnd one’s life will never be weary.\nOpen **Fui** and advance its affairs,\nAnd one’s life will never be saved.\n\nTo see what is small is called *clarity*,\nTo hold to what is soft is called *strength*.\nTo use its light and return to its clarity—\nNo calamity will befall one’s body.\nThis is called *following the constant*.\n\nThe **Classics** say:\nAll under Heaven has a beginning,\nAnd the beginning is called the *Mother of all under Heaven*.\nHaving known its Mother,\nOne knows its children—\nThe children are things.\nHaving known its children,\nOne returns to guard its Mother—\nThus, one’s life is never in peril.\n\nClose **Fui**—**Fui** is *joy*.\nShut its gate—its gate is its *door*.\nThus, one’s life will never be weary.\nOpen **Fui** and advance its affairs,\nAnd one’s life will never be saved.\n\nTo see what is small is called *clarity*—\nKnowing the beginning.\nTo hold to what is soft is called *strength*—\nOvercoming hardness.\nTo use its light—*the children*.\nTo return to its clarity—*the Mother*.\nReturning clarity to use light—\nNo calamity will befall one’s body.\nLight and clarity without calamity—\nThis is called *following the constant*.\n\nThe **Dao** speaks:\nThe *Nameless* is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nThat which is above form is called the **Dao**.\nThe *Named* is the Mother of all things,\nThat which is below form is called *instrumentality*.\nAll under Heaven has a beginning,\nAnd it is called the *Mother of all under Heaven*.\nThus, the Sage, having known its Mother,\nBecomes the master of all things.\nThings are the *children*.\nThe Mother is the **Dao**.\nHaving known its children,\nOne returns to guard its Mother—\nThus, one’s life is never in peril.\n\nClose **Fui**—**Fui** is *joy*.\nAll things emerge from **Zhen**—**Zhen** is the east.\nAll things rejoice in **Fui**—**Fui** is true autumn.\n**Zhen** is the eldest son, thunder.\n**Fui** is the youngest daughter, the marsh.\n**Zhen**, the elder brother, generates it,\n**Fui**, the younger sister, completes it—\nHence it is called *Returning the Younger Sister*.\nThe *Symbol* says:\n*The marsh above, thunder below*—\nThe gentleman returns the younger sister,\nTo eternally know exhaustion and decay.\nThe *Hexagram Commentary* says:\n*Returning the Younger Sister*—\nThis is the great principle of Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth do not unite,\nAnd all things would not flourish.\n*Returning the Younger Sister*—\nThis is the end and beginning of humanity.\nReturning to **Qian**, it is the opening of the gate.\nMeeting **Kun**, it is the closing of the gate.\nThus, it is said:\nClose **Fui**, shut its gate—\nOne’s life will never be weary.\n**Kun** conceals it,\n**Qian** knows the **Dao** of the Great Beginning.\nMetal and water generate each other,\nCounteracting yet harmonizing—\nThe child returns, one *yang* reborn,\nAgain the beginning of opening the gate.\nFire is born from wood,\nDisaster arises and overcomes—\nAt noon, meeting one *yin*,\nAgain the beginning of closing the gate.\nThus, it is said:\nOpen **Fui**, advance its affairs—\nOne’s life will never be saved.\n**Qian** governs as sovereign,\n**Kun** completes the **Dao** of things.\n\nTo see what is small is called *clarity*—\nWhen *yin* first treads on frost,\nOne knows rigid ice is near.\nHardness grows and lengthens—\nHow could August not be inauspicious?\nTo hold to what is soft is called *strength*—\nThe utmost softness can traverse the utmost hardness under Heaven.\n\n「Thus it is said:\nUtilize its radiance—\nNow one knows its **child**,\nReturn to its clarity—\nNow one holds to its **mother**.\nNo harm shall befall one’s body,\nAnd one’s life shall never be in peril.\nHe who guards this **Dao** is said:\nTo follow its eternal principle.\n\n**Virtue** speaks:\nUnder Heaven, all things have a beginning,\nThe **Primordial Qi** of the **Preheaven** is the **mother**,\nThe **Great Polarization** is a single cycle,\nThe **Original Yang** is a single point,\nThe **Great Unity** is a single stroke.\nThat which exists is taken as the **mother** of all things—\nIs this not fitting?\nHaving known its **mother**,\nOne knows its **child**.\nConcentrating on **qi** and governing softness,\nCan one truly emulate the innocence of an infant?\nHaving known its **child**,\nReturn again to its **mother**,\nAnd one’s life shall be eternal—\nThus, one’s life shall never be lost.\n\nNot holding to its **mother**,\nOne does not know the eternal principle,\nAnd rash actions bring disaster.\nTo block its **Fui**—\nThis is the **Dao** of the **Tiger**.\nTo close—\nIts **mysterious feminine gate** need not be as enduring as if it were preserved,\nThus, one’s life shall never be in peril.\n\nTo open its **Fui**,\nAnd take rashness as the eternal principle,\nTo advance its affairs,\nAnd extinguish *yang* with *yin*—\nNot meeting the **Perfect Sage**,\nOne’s life shall never be saved.\n\nTo see what is small is called *clarity*—\nThis is the discussion of subtle permeation,\nAnd the superficial appearance of **qi**.\nTo hold to softness is called *strength*—\nWith softness overcoming hardness,\nAnd weakness overcoming strength.\nUtilize its radiance,\nReturn again to its clarity—\n**Child** and **mother** generate each other,\n**Lead** and **Mercury** refine and transform each other.\n\nTo trifle with **Divine Tools**,\nOne’s body shall surely meet an early doom—\nThus it is said:\nNo harm shall befall one’s body.\n\nThis **Dao** long mastered,\nIs called to follow the eternal principle.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: The Sage’s Warning**\nIf I were to be upright and discerning,\nWalking the **Great Dao**,\nI would fear only the act of giving.\nThe **Great Dao** is most smooth,\nYet people prefer shortcuts.\nThe court is most orderly,\nYet fields lie abandoned,\nGranaries are most empty,\nYet officials wear ornate robes,\nAnd carry sharp blades—\nThey loathe plain food,\nThough wealth overflows—\nThis is called the **boast of the thief**,\nNot the **Dao** indeed.\n\nThe **Classic** says:\nIf I were to be upright and discerning,\nWalking the **Great Dao**,\nI would fear only spreading **virtue** to all under Heaven—\nThis is truly something to be feared.\nThe **Great Dao** is most smooth,\nYet people prefer shortcuts.\nThe court is most orderly,\nYet fields lie desolate,\nGranaries are most depleted—\nAll wear ornate robes,\nCarry sharp blades,\nLoathe plain food,\nAnd wealth overflows—\nThis is called boasting in theft,\nNot the **Dao** indeed.\n\nThe **Dao** says:\nUpright as stone,\nOne shall not last the day.\nThe **perfect** and the **auspicious** are upright as stone,\nYet their affairs endure through the day—\nThis is how one can distinguish them.\n\nThe **Noble Man** knows the subtle and the manifest,\nKnows softness and knows hardness—\nThe hope of ten thousand people,\nTo be upright and discerning,\nWalking the **Great Dao**.\n\nFear only spreading **virtue** to all under Heaven,\nFor this is truly something to be feared.\nThe **Great Dao** is most smooth and level,\nYet people love shortcuts.\nThe court is most orderly,\nYet fields lie desolate,\nGranaries are most barren—\nAll officials wear ornate robes,\nAnd carry sharp blades,\nLoathe plain food,\nAnd wealth overflows—\nThis is called the **boast of the thief**,\nNot the **Dao** indeed.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"To bear and to ride—\nThis brings bandits to your doorstep.\"*\n**To bear** is the affair of the **petty man**,\n**To ride** is the tool of the **Noble Man**.\nThe **petty man** riding the **Noble Man’s** tool,\nThieves will surely covet it.\nThe **ruler** being arrogant above,\nAnd the **subjects** violent below—\nThieves will surely strike them.\n**Arrogance** hides **virtue** and invites thieves,\n**Artifice** adorns the face and invites **lust**.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"To bear and to ride—\nThis brings bandits to your doorstep.\"*\nThis is the **thief’s** invitation.\n\n**Virtue** speaks:\nIf I were to be upright and discerning,\nWalking the **Great Dao**,\nI would fear only spreading **virtue** and teaching **transformation** to people—\nThis is truly something to be feared.\nThe **Great Dao** is most smooth and level,\nYet people refuse to walk the earth steadily—\nTheir steps and strides all prefer shortcuts,\nYet they wish for swift completion.\n\nThus the **Purple Court’s** saying:\n*\"Not knowing true **Lead** and the **ancestral lineage**,\nAll efforts in alchemy are in vain.*\nTo dismiss one’s wife in vain,\nTo teach **fasting** while blocking **yin-yang**,\nTo instruct **celestial fasting** while leaving the **intestines empty**,\nYet herbs, metals, and minerals are all mere dross—\n**Clouds** and **mists**, sun and moon,\nBelong to the realm of illusion.\nEven more, to indulge in **breathwork** and **visualization**,\nAll these differ entirely from **Golden Elixir** affairs.\nThus it is said:\nThe **Great Dao** is most smooth,\nYet people prefer shortcuts.\n\nThe **court** is the **body**,\nThe **fields** are **affairs**,\nThe **granaries** are **internal nourishment**,\n**Ornate robes** are **external adornment**—\nThe **body** is most orderly,\n**Affairs** are most chaotic,\n**Internal nourishment** is most empty,\n**External adornment** is most grand—\nYet they carry sharp blades to aid them,\nLoathe plain food and instead take **medicines**,\nAnd hoard surplus wealth—\nDaily boasting in the ways of **lust** and **theft**,\nThey shall soon decay—\nThis is surely not the **Great Dao**.\n\n**Zhu Yáng** further says:\n*\"Not knowing **yin-yang** nor master and guest,\nWho then knows which is distant and which is close?*\nTo close the **Chamber of Repose** and block the **Tail Gate** and **Orifice**,\nOne has mistakenly slain countless **Yánfú**—\nThis is exactly what is meant.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: The Foundation of Goodness Cannot Be Uprooted**」\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Depth of Contained Virtue**\n\nThat which is well-established cannot be uprooted,\nThat which is well-embraced cannot be cast off—\nThus, descendants offer sacrifices without ceasing.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes **authentic**;\nCultivate it in the family, and its virtue becomes **abundant**;\nCultivate it in the village, and its virtue becomes **enduring**;\nCultivate it in the state, and its virtue becomes **prosperous**;\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes **universal**.\n\nThus, observe the self with the self,\nObserve the family with the family,\nObserve the village with the village,\nObserve the state with the state,\nObserve the world with the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe **Classic** says:\n*\"Those who establish goodness in the **Dao** cannot be uprooted,\nThose who embrace goodness in **virtue** cannot be cast off—\nDescendants thus offer sacrifices without ceasing.\nCultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes **authentic**;\nCultivate it in the family, and its virtue becomes **abundant**;\nCultivate it in the village, and its virtue becomes **enduring**;\nCultivate it in the state, and its virtue becomes **prosperous**;\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes **universal**.\nThus, observe the self with the self, and it does not differ from **authenticity**;\nObserve the family with the family, and it does not differ from **abundance**;\nObserve the village with the village, and it does not differ from **endurance**;\nObserve the state with the state, and it does not differ from **prosperity**;\nObserve the world with the world, and it does not differ from **universality**.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this, indeed.\n\nThe **Dao** says:\n*'Those who establish goodness in the **Dao**—\nWhen one **yang** returns in **revolution**,\nThe **Potential Dragon** remains hidden, unused,\nFirm in its unassailable nature.\nThose who embrace goodness in **virtue**—\nWashing the heart, aligning restraints,\nRetreating to concealment in secrecy,\nFirm in its unseverable nature.\nThus, those who establish and embrace goodness in **Dao** and **virtue**,\nDo not serve kings and nobles,\nBut hold their affairs in **high esteem**—\nHence, the **sixth line’s** *dry* **snare** for the father,\nIn intent honoring the ancestors,\nThus it is said: *\"Descendants offer sacrifices without ceasing.\"*\n\nBy this **Dao** and **virtue** cultivated in the self,\nThe self becomes **authentic**;\nCultivated in the family,\nThe family becomes **abundant**;\nCultivated in the village,\nThe village becomes **enduring**;\nCultivated in the state,\nThe state becomes **prosperous**;\nCultivated in the world,\nThe world becomes **universal**.\nThus, observe one self among myriad selves,\nAnd its virtue grows ever **authentic**;\nObserve one family among myriad families,\nAnd its virtue grows ever **abundant**;\nObserve one village among myriad villages,\nAnd its virtue grows ever **enduring**;\nObserve one state among myriad states,\nAnd its virtue grows ever **prosperous**;\nObserve one world among countless worlds,\nAnd its virtue grows ever **universal**.\nHow do I know this of countless worlds?\nBy this **Dao** and **virtue**, unrooted and unsevered.\n\n**Virtue** says:\n*Zhu Xián* has said:\n*\"One month’s return is one revolution,\nOne year’s nine revolutions and returns are the same—\nOnly by relying on the **Eight Trigrams** do we infer **punishments** and **virtues**,\nFive and six return to **Wu** and **Ji** in the center.\nThus, the **Black Tortoise** and **Hare** bathe,\nFirm in their unseverable nature;\nThe **Potential Dragon** remains unused,\nFirm in its unassailable nature.\nHence it is said: *Those who establish well cannot be uprooted,\nThose who embrace well cannot be cast off.*\nThis **Dao** began with **Fuxi**,\nTransmitted mouth-to-mouth until today,\nNeither absent from nor separate from texts—\nHow much less the descendants of **Shang** whose glory is uncountable?\nGeneration after generation, all are descendants—\nWhat fear is there of sacrifices?\nBy this, cultivation in the self, the village,\nEven to the state and the world,\nIs without limit in its efficacy.\n\nThus, the **Sage** takes the world as self,\nAnd observes its **authenticity**;\nTakes the world as family,\nAnd observes its **abundance**;\nTakes the world as village,\nAnd observes its **endurance**;\nTakes the world as state,\nAnd observes its **prosperity**;\nTakes the world as world,\nAnd observes its **universality**.\nBy this observation alone,\nWhat is it but that before there were countless years,\nAnd after there shall be countless ages?\nBy this, I know it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Depth of Contained Virtue**\n\nThe depth of contained **virtue** is like that of an **innocent babe**.\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nFerocious beasts do not seize,\nRaptors do not strike.\nBones are frail, sinews supple, yet their grasp is firm—\nUnknowing of **male-female union**, yet **qi** naturally surges—\nThe **essence** is at its peak.\nAll day it cries, yet its voice does not falter—\n**Harmony** is at its peak.\nTo know **harmony** is to know **constancy**,\nTo know **constancy** is to know **clarity**.\n**Life’s increase** is called **auspicious**,\nThe **heart’s command** of **qi** is called **strength**.\nWhen things reach their peak, they grow old—\nThis is called **not the Dao**,\nAnd **not the Dao** must be abandoned early.\n\nThe **Classic** says:\n*\"The depth of contained **virtue** is like that of an **innocent babe**.\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nFerocious beasts do not seize,\nRaptors do not strike—\nThere is no **place of death**.\nBones are frail, sinews supple,\nYet the grasp is exceedingly firm.\nUnknowing of **male-female union**, yet **qi** naturally surges—\nThe **essence** is at its peak.\nAll day it cries, yet its voice does not falter—\n**Harmony** is at its peak.\nTo know **harmony** is to know **constancy**,\nTo know **constancy** is to know **clarity**.\n**Constancy** and **clarity** generate **increase**—\nIts name is **auspicious**.\nThe **heart’s command** of **qi**—\nIts name is **strength**.\nWhen things reach their peak, they grow old—\nThis is called **not the Dao**.\nSince it is **not the Dao**,\nIt is better to abandon it early.\"*\n\nThe **Dao** says:\n*\"Those skilled in **nourishing life**,\nContain **virtue** deeply, like the **innocent babe**—\nOn land, they do not encounter **rhinos** or **tigers**,\nIn battle, they are unharmed by weapons.\n**Rhinos** have no place to lodge their horns,\n**Tigers** no place to strike with claws,\nWeapons no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they have no **place of death**.\nThus it is said: *Poisonous creatures do not sting,\nFerocious beasts do not seize,\nRaptors do not strike.*\n\nNow, the **innocent babe** is not yet complete—\nAt five months, it begins to smile,\nAt eight months, teeth emerge,\nBy three years, its lips close,\nAnd it can speak and eat—\nYet it knows nothing of the world.\nBecause it knows nothing,\nIt has no **place of death**.\nThus, bones are most frail,\nSinews most supple,\nYet the grasp is firm on its own.\nEven unknowing of **male-female union**, yet **qi** naturally surges—\nThe **essence** is at its peak.\nAll day it cries, yet its voice does not falter—\n**Harmony** is at its peak.\nTo know **harmony** is to know **constancy** and **clarity**,\n**Constancy** and **clarity** generate **increase**—\nObserving and verifying **auspiciousness**,\nIts revolution is **greatly auspicious**.\nIf not attained in the **heart**, do not seek it in **qi**.\nNow, those who stumble or rush—\nThis is **qi**.\nThe **heart** is the master of **qi.\"*\n\n**Qi** is the master of the body.\nWhen **qi** follows the **heart**, it is in **harmony**;\nWhen the **heart** compels **qi**, it is in **strength**.\n\nIf the **heart** is in **strength**, it will decline;\nIf things are at their peak, they will age—\nThis is called **not the Dao**.\n\nSince it is **not the Dao**,\nIt is better to cease early.\n\n**Virtue** is spoken of thus:\nTo hold **virtue** thick as an infant,\nTo focus **qi** and achieve **softness**,\nOne can be like a babe.\n\nWhen **yin** arises, water advances;\nWhen **yang** arises, fire advances—\nWater and fire tempered by wood,\nLead and mercury in floating and sinking,\nTen months, the fetus is complete;\nThree years, it sheds its shell.\n\nThe **stinging insect** is the **corpse insect**;\nThe **clutching beast** is the **Dragon and Tiger**;\nThe **struggling crow** is the **Crow and Hare**—\nThus, the three **Péng** have no place to lodge their venom,\nMetal and wood have no place to wield their ferocity,\nSun and moon have no place to contain their grasp.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they have no **place of death**.\n\nBones are frail, sinews supple—\nLead, mercury, wood, and metal float in uncertainty, yet remain undetermined.\nFingers and palms grasp firmly—\nHeaven’s patterns and Earth’s features dare not reveal themselves lightly.\n\nThough **male-female union** is unknown, yet **qi** naturally surges—\nIn three months, male and female take form;\nThe kidneys arise first—\n**Essence** is at its peak.\n\nAll day it cries, yet its voice does not falter—\nThe **Elixir Field** is firm and sealed,\nThe **Sea of Qi** is mixed and complete—\n**Harmony** is at its peak.\n\nTo know **harmony** is to know **constancy**—\nThe **Dao** without beginning or name.\nTo know **constancy** is to know **clarity**—\nThe **Dao** without attachment or gain.\n**Constancy** and **clarity** bring **increase**—\nGreat and encompassing, reaching the **divine**,\nThe realm of **auspiciousness**.\n\nThis is **wuwei** yet nothing is left undone,\nTaking the world with **non-action**.\nWhen there is **action**, it is insufficient to take the world—\nFor the **heart** compels **qi** to **strength**.\n\nThus, the **heart** in **strength** declines,\nThings at their peak age—\nThis is called **not the Dao**.\nSince it is **not the Dao**,\nIt is better to cease early.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Wise Do Not Speak**\nThe wise do not speak;\nThose who speak do not know.\n\nClose its **mouth** (兑),\nShut its **door** (门),\nDull its **sharpness**,\nUnravel its **chaos**,\nBlend its **light**,\nUnify its **dust**—\nThis is called **mysterious unity**.\n\nThus, it cannot be drawn near,\nCannot be pushed away,\nCannot be used for gain,\nCannot be used for harm,\nCannot be exalted,\nCannot be belittled—\nTherefore, it is held in honor by the world.\n\nThe **Scripture** says:\nThose who know do not speak,\nThose who speak do not know.\nThus, close its **mouth** (兑),\nShut its **door** (门),\nDull its **sharpness**,\nUnravel its **chaos**,\nBlend its **light**,\nUnify its **dust**—\nThis is called **mysterious unity of Heaven**.\n\nTherefore, it cannot be drawn near,\nCannot be pushed away,\nCannot be used for gain,\nCannot be used for harm,\nCannot be exalted,\nCannot be belittled—\nThus, it is held in honor by the world.\n\nThe **Dao** is spoken of thus:\nAncient scholars cultivated for themselves,\nThe wise did not speak.\n\nModern scholars cultivate for others,\nThose who speak do not know.\n\nHeaven speaks not—\nThe four seasons march in its course;\nEarth speaks not—\nThe myriad things grow in its embrace.\nThe wise do not speak.\n\nWith reverence, they teach the people their proper times;\nThey follow the **symbols** of sun and moon;\nEastward they till, westward they harvest;\nThey smooth the **valleys** and divide the **hills**—\nThose who speak do not know.\n\nThus it is said:\nWhen the **Great Dao** is abandoned,\nThere arise **ren** and **yi**,\nAnd **wisdom** and **cleverness** emerge—\nThis is the **Great Deception**.\n\nBetter to close its **mouth** (兑) and not speak,\nFor speech not guided by the **Dao** is no speech.\nBetter to shut its **door** (门) and not act,\nFor action not guided by the **Dao** is no action.\nTo dull the **sharpness** of all things and speak,\nSo that they bear **great fruit**.\nTo unravel the **chaos** of the people,\nSo that they follow their **tasks**.\nTo blend the **light** of sun and moon,\nTo unify the **dust** of the world—\nThough called **mysterious unity of Heaven**, this is **mysterious unity**.\n\nThus, those who embrace this **Dao**,\nDo not serve kings or nobles,\nHold their **affairs** high and pure—\nTherefore, they cannot be drawn near,\nCannot be pushed away,\nCannot be used for gain,\nCannot be used for harm,\nCannot be exalted,\nCannot be belittled.\n\nThe **Son of Heaven** cannot command them as subjects,\nThe feudal lords cannot claim them as friends—\nIs this not to be held in honor by the world?\n\n**Virtue** is spoken of thus:\nThose who perceive **heart** and **nature** to the point of **command**,\nRetreat and hide in **secrecy**,\nFearful that others may know—\nWould they dare to shape words?\n\nTo glimpse a leopard through a tube,\nSeeing only a patch—\nYet they strive to boast to others,\nFearful that they may not be known—\nWould they dare not to speak?\n\nThus it is said:\nThe wise do not speak;\nThose who speak do not know.\n\n**Purple Yang** says:\n*\"Do not comprehend the inverted meaning within,\nDo not presume to speak of things seen through a tube.\"*\n\nThus, those who have mastered this **Dao**,\nClose its **yin mouth** (兑),\nShut its **yang door** (门),\nDull its **empty words**,\nUnravel its **clamor**,\nBlend its **radiance**,\nUnify its **worldly dust**—\nThis is called **mysterious unity**.\n\n**Mysterious** is called **unity**,\n**Unity** is called **mysterious**—\n**Mysterious** yet again **mysterious**,\nThe **gate of all wonders**.\n\nIt cannot be drawn near—\nNo proximity.\nIt cannot be pushed away—\nNo distance.\nIt cannot be used for gain—\nNo benefit.\nIt cannot be used for harm—\nNo loss.\nIt cannot be exalted—\nNo reverence.\nIt cannot be belittled—\nNo contempt.\n\nTherefore, it is held in honor by the world.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Govern with Rectitude**\nGovern with **rectitude**,\nEmploy the **unexpected** in war,\nTake the world with **non-action**.\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nBy this.\n\nThe world abounds in taboos,\nYet the people grow ever poorer.\n\nMen multiply sharp tools,\nAnd the state grows ever more confused.\n\nThe people multiply clever arts,\nAnd strange things proliferate.\n\nLaws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nYet thieves and robbers abound.\n\nTherefore, the Sage says:\n*\"If I act with non-action, the people transform themselves;\nIf I take no action, the people grow rich;\nIf I love stillness, the people align themselves;\nIf I have no desires, the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThe Classic states:\n*\"Govern with rectitude,\nEmploy the unexpected in war,\nTake the world with non-action.\"*\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nBy this **Dao**.\n\nWhen the world abounds in taboos,\nYet the people grow ever poorer;\nWhen men multiply sharp tools,\nAnd the state grows ever more confused;\nWhen the people multiply clever arts,\nAnd strange things proliferate;\nWhen laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nYet thieves and robbers abound—\nAll these are the effects of **action**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage speaks, referring to the Three Sovereigns:\n*\"If I act with non-action, the people transform themselves;\nIf I take no action, the people grow rich;\nIf I love stillness, the people align themselves;\nIf I have no desires, the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThe **Dao** declares:\n*\"If the state is not governed with rectitude, it cannot be ruled;\nIf war is not waged with the unexpected, it cannot be won;\nIf the world is not taken with non-action, it cannot be claimed.\"*\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nBy this **Dao**.\n\nThe people of the world do not suffer from poverty but from instability,\nNor from scarcity but from inequity.\nFor when equity is achieved, there is no poverty;\nWhen harmony prevails, there is no scarcity;\nWhen stability is secured, there is no upheaval.\nYet when actions are constrained by taboos,\nThe people grow ever poorer.\n\nIn the age of antiquity,\nRustic cups of mud and earthen drums were deemed proper rites,\nYet still sufficient to appease the spirits and gods—\nThe rites and music of that time were simple,\nAnd the common folk possessed unfeigned sincerity.\n\nIn later ages,\nSacrificial grains and wine were displayed in halls,\nJade and bronze vessels adorned the doors,\nWith pipes, bells, strings, and bamboo—\nYet the spirits and gods were often unappeased—\nFor the rites and music had grown elaborate,\nAnd the noble lost their sincerity.\nThe people multiplied their clever tools,\nAnd the state grew ever more confused.\n\nMeng Tian’s innovations began with non-action,\nYet he turned what was useless into what was useful,\nAnd what was strange into what was practical—\nThus, flying wheels, crooked arrows, wooden oxen, and flowing horses were made,\nAnd the people multiplied their clever arts,\nWhile strange things proliferated.\n\nWhen a single law reaches its limit,\nA hundred deceits arise;\nWhen an edict is issued,\nA hundred frauds emerge—\nThus, when laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nThieves and robbers abound.\n\nTherefore, the Sage speaks:\n*\"If I act with non-action, the people transform themselves—*\n*Through the Dao transforming the Dao.*\n*If I take no action, the people grow rich—*\n*Through virtue teaching virtue.*\n*If I love stillness, the people align themselves—*\n*Through merit encouraging merit.*\n*If I have no desires, the people return to simplicity—*\n*Through strength commanding strength.\"*\n\nWithin these words lie the **Dao** of the **Huangdi**, the **Wang**, and the **Ba**.\n**Virtue** declares:\n*\"To govern the state with rectitude,\nAnd to guard one’s self with the Dao of rectitude.*\n*To wage war with the unexpected,\nAnd to gather medicines with the unexpected.*\n*To claim the world with non-action,\nAnd to nurture life without illness.\"*\n\nYet when decay sets in and action is taken,\nIt is no longer sufficient to claim the world.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"How do I know this to be true?\nBy this **Dao**.\"*\n\nThe **Dao** is not difficult, yet the petty paths are most arduous.\nThe **Dao** knows no taboos, yet petty paths abound with them.\n\nWhen the world teems with taboos, the people grow ever poorer;\nWhen petty paths bristle with taboos, the self grows ever more diminished.\n\nWhen men wield many sharp tools, the state grows ever more benighted;\nWhen the self clings to many side paths, the mind grows ever more disordered.\n\nWhen the people master many arts, strange things proliferate;\nWhen the self guards with sturdy armor, sharp blades take life.\n\nWhen laws grow ever more explicit, thieves and robbers multiply;\nWhen precepts grow ever stricter, thieves grow ever more cunning.\n\nAll these are the work of petty paths.\n\nThus the Sage declares:\n*\"If I take no action, the people transform themselves—*\n*By returning to their natural state.*\n*If I have no affairs, the people grow rich—*\n*By embracing simplicity.*\n*If I love stillness, the people align themselves—*\n*By reducing selfishness.*\n*If I have no desires, the people return to simplicity—*\n*By cultivating few desires.\"*\n\nAll these are the work of the **Great Dao**.\n\n---\n*End of

Fifty-Eight: \"Its Governance is Murky\"**\n\nIts governance is murky, murky—\nits people are pure, pure;\nits governance is sharp, sharp—\nits people are defective, defective.\n\nCalamity, oh! Where fortune leans,\nfortune, oh! Where calamity lies.\nWho knows their utmost?\nIs there no right or wrong?\n\nThe right turns to the strange,\nthe good turns to the demonic.\nWhen the people are befuddled,\ntheir days are long indeed.\n\nThus the Sage is square yet does not cut,\nprincipled yet does not cleave,\nupright yet does not flaunt,\nradiant yet does not dazzle.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Its governance murky and pure—*\n*its people but pure;\n*its governance sharp and fierce—*\n*its people are broken, defective.\"*\n\nThus calamity, oh! Where fortune leans and lies,\nwhen pushed to the extreme, is there no right or wrong?\nThe right may become the strange,\nthe good may turn demonic.\nWhen the people are thus befuddled,\ntheir days have long since passed.\n\nThus the Sage, though square yet does not cut,\nprincipled yet does not cleave,\nupright yet does not flaunt,\nradiant yet does not dazzle.\n\nThe Dao says:\n*\"The people of Yao and Shun,*\n*neighboring houses could be sealed—*\n*their governance was murky, murky,*\n*their people pure, pure.*\n\nAn elder struck the earth and said:\n*'The sun rises and we toil,*\n*the sun sets and we rest,*\n*we dig wells to drink,*\n*we till fields to eat—*\n*what power does the Emperor hold over me?'*\nThus it was said: *neighboring houses could be sealed.*\n\n*The people of Jie and Zhou,*\n*neighboring houses could be slaughtered—*\n*their governance was sharp, sharp,*\n*their people defective, defective.*\n\nOn the day of *jiāzǐ* (甲子), before dawn,\nthey received their orders and led their troops like forests,\nthose before turned and hurled their spears,\nattacking those behind, they fled northward,\nblood flowed to float the pestles—\nthus it was said: *neighboring houses could be slaughtered.*\n\nYao passed the throne to Dan Zhu through Shun,\nShun passed the throne to Shang Jun through Yu—\ncalamity, oh! Where fortune leans.\nTang and Wu revolutionized,\nfollowing Heaven and responding to the people—\nfortune, oh! Where calamity lies.\n\nThus when leaning and lying reach the extreme,\nis there no right or wrong in the Dao?\"\n\n「Thus Shun had four *zhēng* (凶), exiled and banished, yet his governance was deemed strange and virtuous.\nYin had three *rén* (仁), who freed slaves and slit their own bellies—\ntheir kindness was called demonic.\n\nThe people’s confusion in this Dao/Way has long been established.\n\nHence the Sage measures it without severing its corners,\npolishes it without dulling its edges,\nstraightens it without overdoing its rectitude,\nshines it without blinding its brightness.\n\nWhen one attains its *wúwéi* (無為) and naturalness,\nthen calamity and fortune cannot find room to lean or lie—\nwho again knows their limits?\n\nThe *virtue/power* (德) says:\nWhen governance is *mènmèn* (昧昧), the people are *chúnhú* (醇醇),\nthe *qi* of Heaven precedes, the *qi* of Earth follows—\nthose who attain it are always as if drunk.\n\nWhen governance is *cháchà* (察察), the people are *quēquē* (缺缺),\nthe sun has eclipses, the moon has eclipses,\nreaching the *wù* (穷) of *wǔjǐ* (戊己), settling on *gēngjiǎ* (庚甲).\n\nAdding to it brings loss,\ncalamity, oh! Fortune leans upon it.\nSubtracting from it brings gain,\nfortune, oh! Calamity lies beneath it.\nWho knows their limits?\nIs there no Dao/Way without right or wrong?\n\nStrange governance becomes virtuous,\nDao/Way reaches its extreme and follows *quán* (權).\nKindness becomes demonic,\nreason is exhausted and enters *shù* (術).\n\nAh! The people of the world have no Dao/Way to uphold,\ntheir confusion by calamity and fortune has long been established.\n\nThus the Sage sees it but does not use it,\nuses it but does not reveal it—\nin the dim twilight, they meet,\nin the obscure depths, changes occur.\nTherefore, he opens *duì* (兑) to measure without further severing,\nextracts *kǎn* (坎) to polish without need for carving,\ntakes *zhèn* (震) to straighten without overdoing,\nadopts *lí* (离) to shine without blinding—\nto make the people of the world attain naturalness and *wúwéi* (無為) and reach their *mìng* (命),\nis this not great?\n\n**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**\n\nGoverning people and serving Heaven—\nnothing surpasses *sè* (啬).\nOnly through *sè* (啬) does one achieve *zǎochù* (早复).\n\n*Zǎochù* (早复) is called *zhòngjīdé* (重积德),\nand *zhòngjīdé* (重积德) means nothing cannot be overcome.\nNothing cannot be overcome means one cannot know its limits,\nand if one cannot know its limits,\nthen one can have a state.\nA state with such a foundation can endure long.\n\nThis is called the Dao/Way of *shēngrén jiǔshì* (深根固蒂、长生久视).\n\nThe *jing* (经) says:\nGoverning people and serving Heaven—\nnothing surpasses *sè* (吝啬).\nOnly through *sè* (吝啬) does one achieve *zǎochù* (早复).\n\n*Zǎochù* (早复) is called *zhòngjīdé* (重积德).\nAccumulating *virtue/power* (德) repeatedly,\nthen nothing cannot be overcome.\nNothing cannot be overcome means one cannot know its limits.\nIf one cannot know its limits,\nthen one can have a state.\nA state without such a foundation does not know its children.\nA state with such a foundation can endure long.\n\nThis is called the Dao/Way of *shēngrén jiǔshì* (深根固蒂、长生久视).\n\nThe Dao/Way says:\n*Kūn* (坤) embodies *sè* (吝啬),\none who bears *thick virtue/power* (厚德) and sustains all things.\n\nServing Heaven above, nourishing people below—\nnothing surpasses *sè* (吝啬).\n*Sè* (吝啬) is *Kūn* (坤) concealing it,\nand all things flourish endlessly without exhaustion.\n\nOnly through *sè* (啬) does one achieve *zǎochù* (早复).\n*Chù* (复) is *hēng* (亨), the *strong* (刚) returning.\nMoving yet proceeding with gentleness,\nthus entering and exiting without harm,\nfriends come without blame.\n\nReturning its Dao/Way,\nin seven days it comes to *chù* (复)—\nthis is the *Tianxíng* (天行).\n*Chù* (复) reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth?\n\n*Zǎochù* (早复) is called *zhòngjīdé* (重积德),\nfor *chù* (复) arises from *Kūn* (坤).\n*Kūn* (坤) accumulates *virtue/power* (德) repeatedly,\nand nothing cannot be overcome.\nNothing cannot be overcome means one cannot know its limits.\nIf one cannot know its limits,\nthen one can have a state.\nThus *Kūn* (坤) is the foundation of states and cities.\nThe children of a state are *zhèn* (震) restoring the eldest son.\nThe foundation of a state is *Kūn* (坤) as Earth, named Mother.\nIt can endure long,\nfor Heaven and Earth endure long.\n\nThis is called the Dao/Way of *shēngrén jiǔshì* (深根固蒂、长生久视),\nand the *virtue/power* (德) unites without bounds.\n\nThe *virtue/power* (德) says:\nGoverning people and serving Heaven—\nthis is exhausting *lǐ* (理) and fulfilling *xìng* (性).\nNothing surpasses *sè* (啬) to reach one’s *mìng* (命).\nThus one achieves *zǎochù* (早复) in its Dao/Way.\n\nAll things are *yún* (芸) and *yún* (芸),\neach returning to its root.\n\n*Zǎochù* (早复) is called *zhòngjīdé* (重积德),\nfor one *yáng* (阳) comes to *chù* (复)—\nthis is *Kūn*’s (坤) repeated accumulation of *virtue/power* (德).\n\nRepeated accumulation of *virtue/power* (德) means nothing cannot be overcome,\ncontaining *principle* (弘) and great brightness,\nall things flourish in harmony.\n\nNothing cannot be overcome means one cannot know its limits,\nreturning to *wújí* (无极).\nIf one cannot know its limits,\nthen one can have a state—\nEarth follows and supports Heaven,\nall states are thus at peace.\n\n*Kūn* (坤) is the Mother of the state,\n*chù* (复) is the Child of the state—\na state with such a foundation.\nIt can endure long,\nfor Heaven and Earth endure long.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure long because they do not generate themselves,\nthus they can long endure.\nHence it is said: This is called the Dao/Way of *shēngrén jiǔshì* (深根固蒂、长生久视).\n\n**Chapter 60: Governing a Great State**\n\nGoverning a great state is like simmering a small fresh delicacy.\nUsing the Dao/Way to preside over the world,\nits *guǐshén* (鬼神) are not *shén* (神).\n\nNot that its *guǐshén* (鬼神) are not *shén* (神),\nbut that its *shén* (神) does not harm people;\nNot that its *shén* (神) does not harm people,\nbut that the Sage also does not harm people.\nWhen both do not harm each other,\nthen their *virtue/power* (德) returns and exchanges.\n\nThe *jing* (经) says:\nGoverning a great state is like simmering a small fresh delicacy,\none must not act.\nUsing the Dao/Way to preside over the world,\nits *guǐshén* (鬼神) cannot become *shén* (神).\nNot that its *guǐshén* (鬼神) are not *shén* (神),\nbut that its *shén* (神) does not harm people;\nNot that its *shén* (神) does not harm people,\nbut that this is because the Sage does not harm people.\nWhen both do not harm each other,\nthen their *virtue/power* (德) returns and exchanges.\n\nThe Dao/Way says:\n*Dàodé* (道德) is the master of the *Sān Cái* (三才).\n*Guǐshén* (鬼神) are the masters of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Sage is the master of *guǐshén* (鬼神).\n*Zhōngfá* (中孚) brings trust even to pigs and fish,\nproliferating and flourishing things.\n\nThe *dǐng* (鼎) is made of wood,\n*Xùn* (巽) and *Huǒ* (火) simmer the cooking.\n\nGoverning a great state is like simmering a small fresh delicacy.\nIts Dao/Way is *wúwéi* (無為),\nits governance is *mènmèn* (昧昧),\nits people are *chúnhú* (醇醇);\nIts Dao/Way is *yǒuwéi* (有為),\nits governance is *cháchà* (察察),\nits people are *quēquē* (缺缺).\n\nThus the Sage measures without severing,\npolishes without carving,\nstraightens without overdoing,\nshines without blinding—\nto preside over the world with the Dao/Way,\nits *guǐshén* (鬼神) cannot become *shén* (神).\n\nAll *qìshí* (气时) disasters, epidemics, *kàngyì* (亢沴), and *yāoniè* (妖孽),\nare the workings of *guǐshén* (鬼神).\nDisasters and demons cannot overcome *shàn dé* (善德),\ncalamities and chaos cannot overcome *shàn zhèng* (善政),\nhence it is said: Using the Dao/Way to preside over Heaven and Earth,\nits *guǐshén* (鬼神) are not *shén* (神).」\n\n「Its demons are not *shén* (神) unless they are their own,\nand even then, their *shén* (神) cannot harm people.\n\nTheir *shén* (神) does not harm people unless it must—\nfor the Sage’s *shàn dé* (善德) and *shàn zhèng* (善政) do not harm people.\nWhen both sides do not harm each other,\nthen demons, gods, and the Sage’s *virtue/power* (德)\nunite and return to the Dao/Way.\n\n*Virtue/power* (德) says:\nThe human body encompasses Heaven and Earth, the great state.\nThe five *zàng* (藏) organs, six *fǔ* (府) organs,\ntwelve *jīng* (经) meridians and fifteen *luò* (络) networks,\nthree hundred and sixty bones, joints, and *xué* (穴)/*shù* (俞) points,\neighty-four thousand pores and *cānglì* (腠理) interstices—\nblood stretches eight hundred and ten *zhàng* (丈),\n*qi* accumulates thirteen thousand five hundred breaths,\na small fresh delicacy indeed.\n\nIf one governs the human body,\nusing the heart as the sovereign to temper *shuǐhuǒ* (水火) with benevolence,\nits *qi* harmonizes and returns to the body,\nand does not scatter into chaos.\n\nIf one governs a great state,\nusing *yīnyáng* (阴阳) and *shuǐhuǒ* (水火) to temper it with *wúwéi* (無為),\nits *virtue/power* (德) harmonizes and returns to the Dao/Way,\nand does not descend into harshness and fragmentation.\n\nThus, under Heaven, the Sage is the sovereign,\nand within the body, the heart is the sovereign.\nThe Sage governs the world with the great Dao/Way,\nand its demons are not *shén* (神).\nIf demons become *shén* (神),\nwhat calamity would not arise?\nThe great Dao/Way would be lost.\n\nThe heart sovereign tempers with true *qi*,\nbalancing the hundred *mài* (脉) vessels,\nand its evils are not *shén* (神).\nIf evils become *shén* (神),\nwhat illness would not arise?\n*Quánzhēn* (全真) would be lost.\n\nFrom this, it is said:\nIts demons are not *shén* (神) unless they must be,\nand even then, they cannot harm people—\nfor the Sage’s governance does not harm people.\nThe Sage’s governance does not harm people,\nso even if demons become *shén* (神),\nwhat further action would they take?\nDemons, when they become *shén* (神),\ndo they truly wish to harm people?\nIt is only when the Dao/Way is not their own that they disturb it—\na matter of necessity, not choice.\n\nWhen the Sage’s governance is benevolent,\ndemons and gods are also benevolent—\nthis is the mutual non-harm,\nhence it is said: *Their virtue/power unites and returns to the Dao/Way.*\n\n**The Great State is the Receptacle of All Currents (Chapter 61)**\nThe great state is the confluence of all currents,\nthe meeting place of the world, the feminine of the world.\nThe feminine ever conquers the masculine by stillness,\nand stillness is the feminine’s nature.\nThus, the great state submits to the small state,\nand the small state submits to the great state.\nSo sometimes it submits to take,\nsometimes it submits and is taken.\n\nThe great state seeks only to shelter and nourish its people,\nthe small state seeks only to serve and enter into the affairs of others.\nBoth sides obtain what they desire,\nso the great must be the feminine.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nThe great state is the confluence of currents,\nthe meeting place of the world, the feminine of the world—\nthe feminine ever conquers the masculine by stillness,\nand stillness is the feminine’s nature.\nThus, the great state submits to the small state,\nand the small state submits to the great state.\nSometimes it submits to take—\nthe great state seeks only to shelter and nourish its people,\nas when *Tàiróng* (太王) left *Xián* (邠).\nSometimes it submits and is taken—\nthe small state seeks only to serve and enter into the affairs of others,\nas when *Gōujīn* (句践) served *Wú* (吴).\n\nThese are all governed by *zhèng* (正) and tempered by stillness,\nsubmitting without *wéi* (為).\nThus, sometimes it submits to take,\nsometimes it submits and is taken.\nThe great state must be the feminine,\nfor both sides obtain what they desire—\nthe small state naturally submits to the great,\nso the great must submit to the small.\n\n*Virtue/power* (德) says:\nThe great state is the great root and vessel.\nReturning to the root is stillness,\nso stillness is the sovereign of turbulence.\nThere are Heaven and Earth before there are myriad things,\nand myriad things before there are male and female.\nThus, the *xiān* (咸) hexagram’s male and female,\nthe feminine above and the masculine below,\nthe two *qi* responding and interacting to restrain each other—\nthis is why it says: *The male submits to the female.*\n\nThus, the masculine of the world meets the feminine of the world,\nthe feminine ever conquers the masculine by stillness,\nand stillness is the feminine’s nature.\nThe great state is the sovereign and ruler,\nthe small state is the subject and servant.\nThe sovereign and ruler belong to the male,\nthe subject and servant belong to the female.\nThus, the *Kūn* (坤) hexagram governs states and cities,\nthe Earth’s Dao/Way, the wife’s Dao/Way, the subject’s Dao/Way.\n\nIf the male submits to the female,\nif the great submits to the small,\nthen Heaven and Earth respond,\nand myriad things transform and flourish.\nIf the female submits to the male,\nif the small submits to the great,\nthen the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is followed,\nenduring forever without ceasing.\nThis is called governing with *zhèng* (正).\n\nThe female may guard stillness,\nthe male may submit to take her—\nhe seeks only to shelter and nourish her.\nThe male may guard stillness,\nthe female may submit to take him—\nshe seeks only to draw near and serve him.\nThis is called employing *qí* (奇) in warfare.\n\nBoth sides obtain what they desire—\nthe female naturally belongs below,\nso the male must submit to her.\n\n**The Dao/Way is the Essence of All Things (Chapter 62)**\nThe Dao/Way is the essence of all things,\na treasure for the virtuous,\na safeguard for the unvirtuous.\nFine words can be sold,\nand noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\nWhat is there to discard in people who are not virtuous?\nThey are the very ones who need the Dao/Way’s protection.»\n\nThus, when establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers, even if one were offered a *gǒngbì* (arc-shaped jade tablet) and four-horse chariot as precedence, it would not compare to sitting and receiving this Dao/Way.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao/Way in such esteem? Was it not because it grants what one seeks and pardons transgressions? Therefore, it is the most precious for all under Heaven.\n\nThe Classic states:\n*The Dao/Way is the essence of all things,\nthe treasure of the virtuous,\nthe refuge of the unvirtuous.*\nFine words can be sold at a fair price,\nand noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\nWhat is there to discard in those who are unvirtuous?\nAlready possessing teachers and noble conduct,\nwhat is there to discard?\n\nThus, when establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers, even if one were offered the *gǒngbì* and the finest treasures, or precedence in a four-horse chariot, it would not compare to sitting and receiving this Dao/Way. Indeed, this Dao/Way is more precious than the *gǒngbì* and surpasses even the four-horse chariot.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao/Way in such esteem? Do not suppose it is merely a means to gain what one seeks or to avoid punishment—therefore, it is the most precious for all under Heaven.\n\nThe *De* (德) declares:\n*The Dao/Way is the essence of all things,\nthe most profound mystery of the world.*\nFormless yet manifest, without substance yet bearing likeness,\nit arises from the Supreme Polarity’s luminous void.\nBefore Heaven’s breath coalesces into a single grain,\ngreat as millet—named *jīnjīng* (金晶, Golden Crystal),\nalso called *zhēnqiān* (真铅, True Lead),\n*yángdān* (阳丹, Solar Elixir),\nor *Tiānyī* (天一, Heaven-One)—\nthe treasure of the virtuous.\nThough it is the treasure of the virtuous,\nit is also the refuge of the unvirtuous.\nIf one encounters a Sage of the highest order,\nwhat heights cannot be attained?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 63: *For Non-Action***\n\nTo act in *non-action*,\nto govern in *non-governance*,\nto savor in *non-savor*—\ngreat or small, much or little,\nrepay enmity with *virtue/power*.\n\nPlan for difficulty when it is still easy,\nachieve the great by beginning with the small.\nThe world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease,\nthe world’s great deeds must arise from the minute.\nThus, the Sage never acts in grandeur,\nand so achieves true grandeur.\n\nHe who lightly promises will seldom keep faith,\nhe who takes many things lightly will meet many difficulties.\nTherefore, the Sage still regards them as difficult,\nand so remains without difficulty.\n\nThe *Classical Text* declares:\nTo act in *non-action*,\nto govern in *non-governance*,\nto savor in *non-savor*.\nTo attain the great from the small,\nto accumulate much from little—\nall stem from repaying enmity with *virtue/power*.\nThus, plan for difficulty when it is still easy,\nachieve the great by beginning with the small.\nFor the world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease,\nthe world’s great deeds must arise from the minute.\nThus, the Sage achieves grandeur by beginning with the small,\nnever acting in grandeur itself,\nand so achieves true grandeur.\nBecause he regards difficulty as difficulty,\nhe remains without difficulty.\n\nWhat does this mean?\nHe who lightly promises will seldom keep faith,\nhe who takes many things lightly will meet many difficulties.\n\nThe *De* (德) states:\n*Non-action* as the foundation of action,\ncalm conquers agitation.\n*Non-governance* as the foundation of governance,\nemptiness conquers fullness.\n*Non-savor* as the foundation of savor,\nsimplicity conquers brilliance.\n\nIn cultivating the self and nurturing life,\nthe first essential is a firm and subtle foundation.\nA firm and subtle foundation must begin with refining the elixir.\nThe proverb says:\n*\"Wealth comes from careful saving,\npoverty from failing to compete.\"*\nDo not dismiss good deeds as too small to perform,\nnor indulge in evil as too trivial to avoid.\nDrips of water, unceasing, become rivers.\nThe high rests upon the low as its base,\nthe noble upon the humble as its root—\nthus, one repays enmity with *virtue/power*.\n\nTherefore, plan for difficulty when it is still easy,\nachieve the great by beginning with the small.\nFor the world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease,\nthe world’s great deeds must arise from the minute.\nThus, the Sage fears not attaining grandeur,\nnever acting in grandeur itself,\nand so achieves true grandeur;\nfears not facing difficulty,\nstill regarding it as difficult,\nand so remains without difficulty.\nTo speak of grandeur before attaining it is to lightly promise—\nseldom will faith be kept.\nTo speak of difficulty before overcoming it is to take things lightly—\nmany difficulties will arise.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 64: *Its Ease in Holding***\n\nIts ease lies in being held firm,\nits unseen signs are best planned early,\nits fragility makes it easy to shatter,\nits subtlety disperses with neglect—\nact before it manifests,\ngovern before disorder arises.\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace grows from a slender sprout;\na nine-tiered tower begins with a single clod of earth;\na thousand-li journey starts beneath one’s feet.\nTo act when it already exists is to court failure,\nto grasp when already disordered is to ensure loss.\nThus, the Sage acts in *non-action* and knows no failure,\nholds nothing and knows no loss.\nMen, in their undertakings, often ruin what is nearly complete.\nTo finish with the same care as the beginning,\nthen no task will fail.\n\nTherefore, the Sage desires what others do not,\nvalues not the hard-to-obtain treasures;\nlearns what others do not learn,\nundoes the errors of the multitude,\never aiding the natural course of all things,\ndaring not to act.\n\nThe *Classical Text* declares:\nIts ease lies in being held firm,\nits unseen signs are best planned early,\nits fragility makes it easy to shatter,\nits subtlety disperses with neglect—\nthus, act before it manifests,\ngovern before disorder arises.\nFor a tree thick enough to embrace grows from a slender sprout;\na nine-tiered tower begins with a single clod of earth;\na thousand-li journey starts beneath one’s feet.\nTo act when it already exists is to court failure,\nto grasp disorder and attempt governance is to ensure loss.\nThe Sage acts in *non-action* and knows no failure,\nholds nothing and knows no loss.\nMen, in their undertakings, often falter in their resolve,\nand so complete what they ruin.\nTo finish with the same care as the beginning,\nthen no task will fail.\n\nTherefore, the Sage desires what others do not desire,\nso he does not value hard-to-obtain treasures;\nlearns what others do not learn,\nundoes the errors of the multitude,\never aiding the natural course of all things,\ndaring not to act.\n\nThe *Dao* declares:\nThat which is stable is easy to hold,\nthat which is yet unmanifest is best planned early,\nthat which is fragile is easy to break,\nthat which is subtle is easy to disperse—\nall must be acted upon before they exist,\ngoverned before they become disordered.\n\nThat which is not yet perilous is the Sage who rests secure in his station.\nThat which is not yet lost is the Sage who preserves what remains.\nThat which is not yet disordered is the Sage who governs its emergence.\n\nThus, the virtuous man remains secure yet never forgets danger,\npreserves existence yet never forgets loss,\ngoverns yet never forgets chaos—\nso his person is secure while his state may be preserved.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* declares:\n*\"Its loss, its loss—\nbound to the mulberry and hemp.\"*\n\nThus, the tree that spans a man’s embrace begins as a tiny sprout;\nthe nine-tiered tower rises from a single clod of earth;\nthe thousand-li journey commences beneath one’s feet—\nthese are the inevitable *Dao* of things.\n\nOne cannot leap over stages to accomplish them,\nnor build upon empty foundations to grasp them—\nto act thus is to court ruin,\nto hold thus is to invite loss.\n\nThe Sage acts in *non-action*, yet progress is truly made,\nso he knows no failure.\nThe Sage does not grasp, yet each step is truly taken,\nso he knows no loss.\n\nBut men’s undertakings differ from this:\nthey do not labor for true advancement,\nyet often falter in their resolve;\nthey do not walk the path with genuine steps,\nyet often stumble in their deeds—\nthough they begin, they ruin what they complete.\nFor completion lies in resolve, yet ruin comes in action;\naction, when true, knows no ruin.\n\nTherefore, to finish with the same care as the beginning,\nto walk with steady feet upon the earth,\nthen no task will fail.\n\nAll men desire hard-to-obtain treasures,\nyet the Sage desires not what they desire—\nso he does not value their treasures.\n\nAll men learn what others have already erred in,\nyet the Sage does not learn what they learn—\nso he can undo their mistakes,\naiding the natural course of all things\nyet daring not to act presumptuously in affairs.\n\nThe *virtue* declares:\nMan’s primordial *qi*, each has one *jin*.\nAt birth, one *jin* of *qi* is but one *dan* in weight.\nIn one year, the twenty-four *qi* produce one *liang*,\nand by sixteen years, one *jin* is fully formed.\nAfter three years past this, one *liang* is consumed,\nand by sixty-four years, one *jin* is utterly exhausted.\nThus, the eighty-eight *guà* of a man’s life span,\nhis primordial *qi* is spent.\n\nWhen primordial *qi* is stable and secure,\nit is very easy to hold firm against peril;\nwhen primordial *qi* is faint and unclear,\nit is very easy to plan its early signs;\nwhen primordial *qi* is soft and fragile,\nit is very easy to shatter its hardness;\nwhen primordial *qi* is subtle and refined,\nit is very easy to disperse its lodging.\n\nTo act before things arise,\nthen there is no need for action;\nto govern before things become disordered,\nthen there is no need for governance.\n\nThe tree that spans a man’s embrace begins as a tiny sprout—\nthis is the *yang* spirit’s interaction with the *qi*.\nThe nine-tiered tower rises from a single clod of earth—\nthis is the *golden elixir*’s refinement in the *jing*.\nThe thousand-li journey commences beneath one’s feet—\nthis is the *valley spirit*’s reliance on the *dark mother*.\n\nEach step must be firmly trodden,\nno shortcuts allowed.\nTo act by shortcuts is to court ruin,\nto grasp by artifice is to invite loss.\n\nThe Sage acts in *non-action* yet does nothing without effect,\nso he knows no failure.\nHe does not grasp yet does nothing without holding,\nso he knows no loss.\n\nBut men’s ways in these matters are otherwise:\nthey do not know the great *Dao* of *non-action*,\nspitting out the old and taking in the new,\nseeking solitude and stillness,\nlong in the use of resolve yet short in the use of action—\nsometimes open, sometimes blocked,\nhalf secure, half perilous,\nwith occasional small successes,\nyet ruined at the turn of a hand.\nHow could they exhaust the principles and reach the essence,\nthus attaining the *Way* of life?\n\nOnly by grasping the primordial *non-action* of the *Dao*,\nremaining steadfast from beginning to end,\nthen no task will fail.\n\nThe Sage does not desire what men desire—\nso he does not value hard-to-obtain treasures;\nhe does not learn what men learn—\nso he can undo the multitude’s errors,\naiding the natural course of all things\nyet daring not to act presumptuously.\n\nThe *Classic* of the ancient Sage who practiced the *Dao* (Chapter Sixty-Five):\nThe ancient Sage who practiced the *Dao*\ndid not seek to enlighten the people,\nbut rather to keep them in simplicity.\nThe people are hard to govern,\nbecause their cleverness is too great.\n\nThus, to govern the state with cleverness is to be its thief;\nto govern the state without cleverness is to be its blessing.\nThese two are the people’s models.\n\nTo always know these models,\nthis is called *mysterious virtue*.\nThe *mysterious virtue* is profound and distant,\ncontrary to the ways of things—\nthen only does it reach the great harmony.\n\nThe text declares:\nThe ancient Sage who practiced the *Dao*\ndid not seek to make the people use its wisdom,\nbut rather to make them use its simplicity.\nThe people are hard to govern,\nbecause their cleverness is too great.\nThus, to govern the state with cleverness is to be its thief;\nto govern the state without cleverness is to be its blessing.\nThese two are the people’s models.\n\nTo always know these models,\nthis is called *mysterious virtue*.\nThe *mysterious virtue* is profound and distant,\ncontrary to the ways of things—\nthen only does it reach the great harmony.\n\nThe *Dao* declares:\nThe people can be made to follow,\nbut cannot be made to understand.\nThere are those who govern others,\nand those who are governed by others—\nthus the people can be led to joyful success,\nbut cannot be made to share in planning its beginnings.\n\nIf the people are made to understand,\nit is like commanding them to build a house on the highway—\nthree years, yet it will never be finished.\nThus, the ancient Sage who practiced the *Dao*\ndid not seek to make the people use the *Dao*’s wisdom,\nbut rather to make them use the *Dao*’s simplicity.\n\nTo use the *Dao*’s wisdom is the way of the Sage—\nwithout the virtuous, none can govern the common folk.\nTo use the *Dao*’s simplicity is the way of the common folk—\nwithout the common folk, none can nurture the Sage.\n\nIf the people use the *Dao*’s wisdom,\nthey will vie for cleverness and craftiness,\ntheir hearts laboring while their days grow ever more incompetent.\nIf the people use the *Dao*’s simplicity,\nthey will return to purity and revert to simplicity,\ntheir hearts at ease while their days grow ever more restful.\n\nWhen the common folk use the *Dao* yet do not know it,\nthe *Dao* of the virtuous is still rare—\nhow much more so the *Dao* of the Sage?\n\nThis is *non-action* yet nothing is left undone.\nThe foolish, in the *Dao*’s simplicity;\nthe wise, in the *Dao*’s wisdom—\nnot to deliberately make the people wise or foolish,\nbut rather to make them use wisdom and simplicity,\nthis is the Sage’s artful balance.\n\nThe people are hard to govern,\nbecause their cleverness is too great—\nto use the *Dao*’s wisdom is to govern with cleverness,\nthus to be the state’s thief.\nThe people are easy to govern,\nnot because they are simple—\nto use the *Dao*’s simplicity is to govern without cleverness,\nthus to be the state’s blessing.\n\nTo always know these models,\nthis is called *mysterious virtue*—\nthe people’s standard of excellence.\nTo always adhere to these models,\nthis is called *mysterious virtue*.\n\nThe **mysterious virtue** of Heaven is profound and distant,\nthus it turns contrary to all things.\nHence it is easily inverted by calculation—\nHeaven’s body revolves westward,\nwhile the sun, moon, and five stars move eastward.\n\nHeaven is high in the southeast,\nthe Earth is high in the northwest,\nthe Earth is low in the southeast,\nHeaven’s *qi* descends,\nEarth’s *qi* ascends—\nall contrary to things.\n\nWhen its work is complete,\nthen it is unified—\nthus the *Dao* of Heaven, Earth, and the Sage\ndoes not oppose all ten thousand things,\nor else they could not succeed in the world.\nHence it is said: **Only then does it reach the Great Harmony.**\n\n**Virtue** is spoken of:\nThe *Dao* is the primordial Way of Heaven.\nThe *Dao* is the sovereign of the human heart,\nthe divine master of true *qi*.\nThe people are the five *zàng* organs, six *fǔ* viscera, and twelve *guī* palaces.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in cultivating life and nurturing the essence\ndid not treat the twelve *guī* palaces as clever,\nnor did they treat them as simple—\nbut rather, they made the heart and spirit their master.\n\nIf each palace were allowed to govern its own affairs,\nthen the body would first fall ill—\nhow could one then nurture the essence?\n\nThus the people are hard to govern,\nbecause their cleverness is too great—\ntoo much cleverness means they must be governed by cleverness,\nnot by the Way of non-action.\nHence to govern with cleverness is the state’s thief,\nwhile to govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.\n\nTo know these two models of governing the body and the people,\nthis is the standard of excellence for life and essence.\nTo always know the *Dao* of these models,\nthis is called **mysterious virtue**.\n\n**Mysterious virtue** is profound and distant—\nthe *Dao* of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and all things’ creation.\nAll contrary to things,\nyet it reaches the Great Harmony without confusion.\n\nThe rivers and seas are the sovereigns of all valleys—\nChapter Sixty-Six\nThe reason the rivers and seas can be sovereigns of all valleys\nis that they excel in descending—\nthus they can be sovereigns of all valleys.\n\nTherefore, the Sage who wishes to rule above others\nspeaks with humility below;\nwho wishes to lead others\nplaces himself behind them.\n\nThe Sage thus stands above yet people do not feel burdened,\nleads yet people do not feel oppressed—\ntherefore the world gladly follows and never tires.\n\nBecause he does not contend,\nnone under Heaven can contend with him.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"The rivers and seas can be sovereigns of all valleys\nbecause they excel in descending—\nthus they can be sovereigns of all valleys.\"*\n\nTherefore, the Sage who seeks to rise above others\nmust speak with humility below;\nwho seeks to lead others\nmust place himself behind them.\n\nThus the Sage stands above yet people do not deem him heavy,\nleads yet people do not deem him harmful—\ntherefore the world gladly follows and never tires.\nBecause he does not contend,\nnone under Heaven can contend with him.\n\nThe *Dao* states:\n*\"Great states are like the lower reaches of rivers—\nthe rivers and seas can be sovereigns of all valleys\nbecause they excel in descending—\nthus they can be sovereigns of all valleys,\nmirroring the Earth’s yielding nature (坤之象).*\n\nThough the seas may number four,\nthe eastern and southern are the largest,\nfor their nature is to descend.\nThus the tides’ reliability,\neven as they travel west beyond a thousand *li* to reach Luoyang,\nnearly reaching the center of the Earth.\nThe reason the island peoples of the eastern and southern seas suffer most from flooding\nis that they are near the rivers’ lower reaches—\nso it is known that the rivers and seas can be sovereigns of all valleys\nonly because they descend in their earthly form.\n\nThe Sage thus can be above all the myriad people\nonly because he descends through his words;\nhis body can lead all the myriad people\nonly because he places himself behind them.\"\n\nThus, by honoring what is low and disregarding what is high, one gains the people’s allegiance.\nBy speaking before the people, they forget their toil;\nby leading them into danger, they forget their fear of death.\nBy placing themselves behind, they come first;\nby abandoning themselves, they are preserved.\n\nTherefore, the Sage stands above the myriad people,\nyet they are revered without burden;\nhe moves before the myriad people,\nyet they follow without resistance.\n\nThus, the world willingly promotes him without tiring,\nfor he does not contend with the people.\n\nOnly he who does not contend\ncan ensure none contend with him.\n\n**Virtue/Power says:**\nThe *dantian* and *qihai* are where the *gushen* true-qi converges.\nBecause they excel in descending,\nthey receive the homage of all rivers and streams,\nable to be sovereigns of the valleys,\nnourishing the roots of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThus, the heart-spirit, adorned above the Five Phases,\nmust descend through true-qi;\nto surpass the Five Phases’ order,\none must yield to blood-qi.\n\nTherefore, the heart-sovereign, named above the Five Phases,\nis revered without burden;\nthe spirit, placed before the Five Phases,\nis followed without resistance.\n\nThus, the four limbs, six pulses, myriad transformations, and hundred bones\nwillingly promote it without tiring,\nfor the heart-spirit acts without striving\nand does not contend with the Five Phases for precedence.\n\nIf there is contention,\nthen bitterness and suffering do not cease,\nacrid and pungent do not harmonize,\nserene and bland do not communicate,\nemptiness and nothingness do not intermingle,\ntrue-qi does not follow,\nspirit does not abide,\nand diseases arise—\nhow can this be called the Way?\n\nOnly when the heart-sovereign does not contend\ncan the Five Phases not contend with it.\nGreat indeed are these words!\n\nThe world says my Way is great, yet seems unworthy.\nOnly because it is great does it seem unworthy.\nIf it seemed worthy for long, it would be trifling indeed.\n\nI possess three treasures; I hold them dear.\nFirst: compassion,\nSecond: frugality,\nThird: not daring to act first under Heaven.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous;\nfrugality makes one expansive;\nnot daring to act first under Heaven makes one the vessel’s leader.\n\nNow, abandoning compassion and courage,\nabandoning frugality and expansiveness,\nabandoning humility and precedence—\nthis is death.\n\nCompassion, when used in war, brings victory;\nwhen used in defense, brings security.\nIf Heaven intends to save this person,\nit will first shield them with compassion,\nrestrain them with frugality,\nand weaken them by not daring to act first under Heaven—\nonly then can they become the leader of the sacred vessel.\n\n**Virtue/Power says:**\nThe world says I have attained the great Way,\nyet seem unworthy of it.\nBecause the Way is great, it seems unworthy.\nIf greatness seemed worthy for long,\nit would be the speech of the vulgar, not the enlightened.\n\nThe Way fills all under Heaven, permeating all things—\nhow can there be worthy or unworthy in greatness?\n\nZhongyong says:\n*\"Each person has the elixir of longevity,\nyet fools discard it in their confusion.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"This supreme treasure is in every home,\nyet fools fail to recognize it fully.\"*\n\nIs it only that the great is the Way?\nThus it is said: I have three treasures; people should cherish and hold them.\nFirst: compassion—no cruelty,\ncompassion without cruelty makes one courageous.\nSecond: frugality—no greed,\nfrugality without greed makes one expansive.\nThird: not daring to act first under Heaven—no aggression,\npreceding without aggression makes one the vessel’s leader.\n\nNot daring to be the world’s courageous one,\nthus one fulfills compassion’s leadership;\nnot daring to be the world’s expansive one,\nthus one fulfills frugality’s leadership;\nnot daring to act first under Heaven,\nthus one fulfills the vessel’s leadership.\n\nFine weapons are inauspicious instruments;\nused only when unavoidable, serenity is supreme.\nTo win in battle and rejoice is to delight in killing.\nThose who delight in killing must be killed—\nthus they cannot achieve their desires under Heaven.\n\nNow, abandoning compassion and courage,\nand instead indulging in cruelty—\n\nAbandoning frugality yet seeking expansion,\nand instead indulging in greed—\nabandoning humility yet acting first,\nand instead indulging in aggression—\ntheir swift death is certain.\n\nThis is the ignorance of compassion,\nthe foundation of defense and war.\nTo wage war with compassion,\nthe world submits to you;\nto wage war with cruelty,\nyour kin betray you.\nWith what the world submits to,\nattack what your kin betray—\nthus the virtuous warrior\nhas no need to fight,\nyet when he fights, he is certain to win.\n\nTo defend the realm with compassion,\nthe world aids you;\nto defend the realm with greed,\nthe world despises you.\nWith what the world aids you in,\ndefend against what the world despises—\nthus the virtuous warrior\nhas no need to defend,\nyet when he defends, he is unshakable.\n\nTherefore, when Heaven intends to bestow the Great Dao\nto save this person,\nit must make him wield compassion\nas his unbreakable armor and sharpest weapon.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtuous Warrior**\n\nThe virtuous warrior is not aggressive,\nthe skilled fighter does not rage,\nthe master of victory does not engage,\nthe adept at using men places himself below them.\n\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthis is called the power of using men,\nthis is called aligning with Heaven’s ancient extremes.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe virtuous warrior is not aggressive,\nthe skilled fighter does not rage,\nthe master of victory does not engage in battle,\nthe adept at using men first places himself below them.\n\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthis is called the power of using men,\nthis is called aligning with Heaven’s ancient extremes.\n\nThe Way says:\nKing Wu crossed the孟津 river,\nand the lords of the eight hundred states gathered without summons.\nKing Wu said: *\"It is not yet time.\"*\n\nAfter two years, he extinguished Zhou,\nand this is called the virtuous warrior not being aggressive.\n\nAt the hour of甲子, dawn breaking,\nthe king arrived at the outskirts of Shang,\nand there he swore his oath.\nThe king held the yellow axe in his left hand,\ngrasped the white banner in his right,\nand waved them—\nthis is called the skilled fighter not raging.\n\nThe enemy’s troops were arrayed like forests,\nyet none dared oppose our army.\nThe vanguard turned their spears and struck from behind,\ndriving them north.\nBlood flowed, staining the battle-axes red,\nand the world was at peace—\nthis is called the master of victory not engaging.\n\nThe enemy had countless millions,\ntheir hearts and virtues divided,\nwhile we had but three thousand warriors,\nour hearts and virtues united.\nEven great states feared our strength,\nsmall states cherished our virtue—\nthis is called the adept at using men placing himself below them.\n\nThus King Wu—\nthis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthis is called the power of using men,\nthis is called aligning with Heaven to set the ancient extremes.\n\nThe Virtue says:\nThe world’s exchange,\nthe world’s female—\never with stillness overcoming the male,\never with stillness placing itself below.\n\nThus, when yin is above,\nyang flees beneath,\nthe head and tail are aggressive,\nthe center is refined.\nThis is knowing that the adept at refining fire\nis not solely for aggression—\nthus the adept at the Great Dao\nis not aggressive yet is aggressive,\nnot refined yet is refined—\nhence, the virtuous warrior is not aggressive.\n\nStrong arms and battlefield victories are still inauspicious—\nhow much more so when raging in battle?\nThus the skilled fighter does not rage,\nsubduing the enemy without striking.\n\nThe sage’s gaze meets the Dao’s presence,\nspirit encountering spirit—\neven when tortoises gaze at each other,\ncranes call to cranes,\nthey still meet spirit with spirit—\nhow much more so for the master of victory?\nThus he does not engage in battle.\nThe adept at using men places himself below.\n\nThe world’s ultimate softness\ngallops across the world’s ultimate firmness—\nthis is called the virtue of non-contention.\nBecause he does not contend,\nnone under Heaven can contend with him—\nthis is called the power of using men.\nGive the people what they desire,\nremove what they hate—\nthose who walk this Way\nare called aligning with Heaven since ancient times without parallel.\n\n**Chapter 69: The Art of War’s Speeches**\n\nThe art of war has this saying:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"*\n\nThis is called moving without moving,\npushing without arms,\nadvancing without resistance,\nseizing without weapons.\n\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nunderestimating the enemy risks losing our treasure.\nThus when armies clash,\nthe compassionate one wins.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe art of war has this saying:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor but am always the defender,\nI dare not advance an inch but always retreat a foot.\"*\n\nThis is called moving as if not moving,\npushing as if without arms,\nadvancing as if without resistance,\nseizing as if without weapons.\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nunderestimating the enemy risks losing our treasure—\nthus when armies clash,\nthe first to show compassion wins.\n\nThe Way says:\nThe military has this saying:\n*\"Do not dare to be the aggressor—\nthe army marches by discipline,\nlosing discipline brings disaster—\nyet always be the defender—\nthis is called the power of using men,\nthus one does not dare to be the aggressor but is always the defender.\"*\n\nThree parts of Shang’s realm\nwere already held by King Wen,\nyet he still served Shang.\nFor nine years, his great merit was not yet fulfilled,\nuntil King Wu and the Duke of Zhou succeeded him—\nthis is called not daring to advance an inch but always retreating a foot.\n\nThe revolution of Tang and Wu\nfollowed Heaven’s will and responded to the people.\nThe east was pacified, the west lamented.\n*\"Our lord has gone—\nmay those who come after him revive him!\"*\nThe people he left behind\nrejoiced in their homes—\nthis is called moving without moving,\npushing without arms,\nadvancing without resistance,\nseizing without weapons.\n\nThe Minor Teacher said:\n*\"Not opposing the king is not an enemy.\"*\nWhen Chu defeated him,\nthis is why he was annihilated at 随.\n\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nunderestimating the enemy risks losing our treasure.\nWhen Wu and Yue clashed in battle,\nYue, unable to resist, begged for submission,\nand Wu released them—\nlater, they were destroyed by Goujian.\nThus it is said:\nwhen armies clash,\nthe compassionate one wins.\n\nThe Virtue says:\nPurple Yang says:\n*\"A pound of medicine requires sixteen ounces,\nadjusting the fire’s timing with yin and yang.\"*\n\nNurturing medicine requires fire’s timing,\nand timing must be balanced between yin and yang.\nFire’s timing has refinement and aggression,\nhas guest and host—\nthis is the law of war.\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"Using generals, divide into left and right armies—\nlet them be the host, I the guest.\nI urge you: on the battlefield, do not underestimate the enemy,\nlest you lose your family’s priceless treasure.\"*\n\nThis is precisely what is meant.\n\nIn general, the **Way of wielding armies**,\n**cowardice** is the master—\ncowardice means one does not dare to underestimate the enemy,\nthus one always awaits the weary with ease,\ndulls the sharp with the blunt,\nawaits the moving with stillness,\nand governs the martial with the refined.\nHence, through strategic maneuvering and negotiations,\none can bend the enemy’s strength **without battle**.\n\nThose who wield armies say:\n*\"I dare not be the host but only the guest,*\nand *\"I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"*\nThis is called **acting where there is no action**,\n**resisting where there is no arm**,\n**persisting where there is no enemy**,\nand **grasping where there are no troops**.\nThus, the greatest calamity is underestimating the enemy—\nunderestimating the enemy risks losing our treasure.\n\nPurple Yang further says:\n*\"Before the first string, after the first string, before the first string—\nthe flavors blend evenly, the qi fully manifests.\"*\n\nWhen the herbs are gathered and placed in the furnace to calcine,\ncalcined and then tempered through warm nurturing and simmering,\nthe finest medicines—**cinnabar and mercury**—\nare nothing but these two substances in their raw form.\nWhen combined and calcined,\ntheir mastery depends entirely on **fire’s timing**,\nadding or subtracting as needed.\nToo refined, they fail to mature;\ntoo aggressive, they dissipate.\nThus, one must not dare to underestimate **fire’s timing**,\nlest one risk losing our treasure.\n\n**Refinement and aggression must complement each other**,\n**rigor and yielding must alternate**—\nonly through careful balance can one achieve the desired effect.\nHence, when armies clash,\nthe compassionate one wins.\n\nIn stalemate, where strength and resolve are matched,\nif one acts presumptuously, defeat is certain.\nIf pressed to act,\none may use humble words to evoke **compassion**,\nand gentle demeanor to provoke **arrogance**,\nletting the enemy indulge their ambitions\nbefore achieving self-victory.\n\nMy words are **very easy to know, very easy to act upon**,\nyet none under heaven can know them,\nnone can act upon them.\nWords have a **foundation**,\naffairs have a **lord**.\nIt is only because of the world’s **lack of knowing**,\nthat none knows me.\nFew know me—\nthus I am **noble**.\nHence, the **Sage wears coarse robes while holding precious jade**.\n\nThe **Scripture** says:\n*\"My words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to act upon.\nBecause they are the most easy,\nnone under heaven can know them,\nnone can act upon them.\nTheir words have a foundation,\ntheir affairs have a lord.\nIt is only because of the world’s lack of knowing,\nthat none knows me.\nThus, few know me—\nI am noble.\nHence, the Sage wears coarse robes while holding precious jade,\nyet none knows him.\"*\n\nThe **Dao** says:\n*\"The Dao is near yet men seek it afar,\naffairs are easy yet men seek them with difficulty.\nAll things under heaven are born from the Dao—\nnone can be separated or chosen.\nVery easy to know,\nvery easy to act upon—\nthe Dao is near, affairs are easy.\nYet none under heaven can know it,\nnone can act upon it—\nthey seek it afar, they seek it with difficulty.\nThe world has long called me great,\nyet my subtlety is profound.\n\nIf speaking of **Heaven and Earth**,\none must begin with **Taiji**;\nif speaking of **all things**,\none must begin with **Heaven and Earth**;\nif speaking of **male and female**,\none must begin with **father and mother**.\nThus, words have a foundation,\naffairs have a lord.\nIt is only because of this **lack of knowing**,\nthat none can truly know me.\nNow that none can know me,\nfew know me—\nthus I know my own **nobility**.\nHence, the Sage wears coarse robes while holding precious jade—\nwho can know him?\"*\n\nThe **Virtue** says:\nPurple Yang says:\n*\"Common speech and vulgar sayings align with the **Sage’s Dao**,\nyet one must carefully investigate within them.\nIf one seeks to invert daily usage,\neven the dust of the earth becomes treasure.\nMy words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to act upon.\nYet when asked their meaning,\nnone under heaven can know them,\nnone can act upon them—\nwhy is this so?\nTheir words have a foundation,\ntheir affairs have a lord.\nTheir words have a foundation—\nthey do not depart from **Taiji, the Two Qi (Yin-Yang), the Four Symbols, the Eight Trigrams**;\ntheir affairs have a lord—\nthey do not depart from **Heaven and Earth, the Sun and Moon, male and female, water and fire**.\nApplied to **Heaven and Earth**,\nall things naturally arise and flourish—\nvery easy to know,\nvery easy to act upon.\nTransferred to the **human body**,\nthe **heart and kidneys** naturally embody **water and fire**—\nyet none under heaven can know them,\nnone can act upon them.\nIt is only because of the world’s **lack of knowing**,\nthat none can truly know me.\nFew know me—\nthus I know my **Dao’s nobility**.\nHence, the Sage wears coarse robes while holding precious jade—\nwho can know him?\"*\n\n「Thus, the Sage despises coarse attire,\nyet cherishes **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**—\nhence the saying: *\"Wearing coarse robes while holding precious jade.\"*\nThe common folk observe his exterior,\nyet fail to perceive his interior—\nhow then can they know the Sage’s **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**\nTo know the unknown—this is **nobility**;\nto claim to know what is unknown—this is **illness**.\nOnly by **illness** of the **illness**,\nis it that one does not fall **ill**.\nThe Sage does not fall **ill**,\nbecause he **illnesses** the **illness**,\nand thus does not fall **ill**.\nThe **Sutra** says:\n*\"To know as unknown is **nobility**;\nto claim to know what is unknown is **illness**.*\nOnly by **illnessing** his **illness**,\nis it that one does not fall **ill**.\nThe Sage does not fall **ill**,\nbecause he **illnesses** the **illness**,\nand thus does not fall **ill**.\nThe **Dao** says:\n*\"To know what one knows as known,\nand to know what one does not know as unknown—\nthis is true knowing.*\nThus, the true **knower** does not speak;\nthe speaker does not truly **know**.\nYet the Sage’s **Dao**—\nbooks cannot exhaust his words,\nwords cannot exhaust his meaning.\nLike a pearl rolling through a jade tray,\nit meets **origin/root** on all sides,\nand there is no path it cannot take.\nFor his **Great Dao** is originally without words or speech,\nall is **wuwei** and natural.\nEven to know as unknown is still not true knowing—\nhow much more so to claim to know what is unknown?\nThus, the true **knower** does not consider himself as **knowing**—\nthis is **nobility**;\nthe false **knower** forcefully claims **knowing**—\nthis is **illness**.\nThose who can **illness** the **illness** of claiming to know what is unknown as their own **illness**,\nand thus do not fall **ill**.\nWhy does the Sage not fall **ill**?\nIt is because he can **illness** his **illness**,\nand thus is not afflicted by the Sage’s **illness**.\n**Virtue/Power** says:\n*\"My words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to act upon—\nto know the unknown is **nobility**.\nAll under Heaven cannot act upon it,\nto claim to know what is unknown is **illness**.\nThus, the Sage’s governance—\nempties the mind,\nfills the belly,\nweakens the will,\nstrengthens the bones,\nand makes the people without knowledge or desire.\nTo know the unknown is **nobility**—\nthis was the **Dao/Way** of the ancient scholars.\nThe self-perceived are not enlightened,\nthe self-righteous do not shine forth,\nexcess food and redundant actions—\nothers may detest them.\nTo claim to know what is unknown is **illness**—\nthis is the **Dao/Way** of today’s scholars.\nThose

**illnesses** the **illness**,\nand can **illness** his **illness**,\nand thus does not fall **ill**.*\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear the Way’s威威**\nThe people do not fear the **威威**,\nyet the **Great威威** has truly arrived.\nDo not narrow their dwelling,\ndo not sicken of their birth.\nOnly by not sicken,\nis it that one does not sicken.\nThus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,\nloves himself without esteeming himself—\nhence he discards that and takes this.\nThe **Sutra** says:\n*\"The people do not fear the **威威**,\nyet the **Great威威** has truly

clear,\nI make the people wise and clear.\nHeaven’s **威威** is manifest,\nI make the people’s **威威** manifest and thus fear it.\nHeaven aids the lower people,\nmaking them lords, making them

position under Heaven,\nwalks the **Great Dao** of Heaven,\nwhen he achieves his aims, he follows the people’s desires,\nwhen he does not achieve his aims, he perfects himself alone—\nthis is enough, this is what a **Great Man** does.\nTo love them is to wish them to live,\nto narrow their dwelling by oneself.\nTo hate them is to wish them to die,\nto sicken of their birth by oneself.\nHow shallow the **Great Man**!\nThus it is said:\n*\"Do not narrow their dwelling—\nthis is the **Dao/Way** of knowing oneself.\nDo not sicken of their birth—\nthis is the **Dao/Way** of loving oneself.*\nOnly by

Daring**\nBoldness in daring leads to death,\nboldness in not daring leads to life.\nThese two may bring benefit or harm—\nwhat does Heaven detest?\nWho knows its reason?\nThus, the Sage finds it

two,\nbenefit and harm are clearly known.\nWhat Heaven abhors,\nwho knows its reason?\nThus, the Sage still finds it difficult to know.\n\nFor indeed, the **Dao** of Heaven,\ndoes not contend yet naturally triumphs,\ndoes not speak yet naturally responds,\ndoes not summon yet they come on their own,\nplain and clear, yet well-planned.\nHence, Heaven’s net is vast and wide,\nrarely missing yet not confining.\n\nThe **Dao** says: Out of compassion, one can be bold,\nbut daring leads to killing others.\nIf one dares to kill others,\nothers will surely kill in return—\nhence it is said: boldness in daring will meet death.\n\nThe greatest boldness in governing the world,\ndwells in the greatest stillness,\nusing softness to overcome hardness,\nusing stillness to conquer heat—\nboldness in not daring leads to life.\n\nIn general, these two bring either benefit or harm,\nand all know this.\nWhat Heaven abhors,\nwho knows its reason?\nThus, the Sage still finds it difficult to know its reason.\n\nThe essence of Heaven’s abhorrence:\nthose who dare and meet death—\nthose who act and love contention,\nthose who speak without knowing,\nthose who exalt differences and lack planning—\nthese are what Heaven abhors.\nHence, the **Dao** of Heaven,\ndoes not contend yet naturally triumphs.\n\nEarth has nurturing, growth, harvest, and concealment,\nthick **virtue** bearing all things,\ndoes not speak yet naturally responds.\n\nHumans have benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom,\ngreat undertakings completing all things,\ndo not summon yet they come on their own.\n\nThis is called the **Dao** of Heaven,\nplain and clear, yet well-planned.\n\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions,\nthe Sage perfects their abilities—\nhuman scheming, ghostly scheming,\nall share in their functions.\nThus, those who naturally triumph do not contend,\nthose who naturally respond do not speak,\nthose who come on their own are not summoned,\nthose who are well-planned are plain and clear.\n\nWhy does Heaven’s **Dao** operate thus?\nBecause Heaven’s net is vast and wide,\nopen yet never misses.\n\nHeaven encompasses the great Earth,\nits vast net.\nEmpty and void, yet never misses.\n\n**Virtue** says: In the use of arms, there are words:\nDo not dare to be the aggressor but instead the defender,\ndo not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.\n\nBoldness in decisive daring,\nmeans being the aggressor and advancing an inch—\nhence it meets death.\nBoldness in not daring,\nmeans being the defender and retreating a foot—\nhence it leads to life.\n\nThese two bring either benefit or harm:\nsome dare to die and meet death,\nsome dare to live and remain alive—\nlet each choose their own boldness.\n\nWhat Heaven abhors,\nwho among the world knows its reason?\nThus, the Sage still finds this difficult,\nthe great transformation of nature.\n\nHence, the **Dao** of Heaven,\ndoes not contend yet naturally triumphs—\nit must first

within.\n\nThis is called: open yet never missing.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Four: The Way of Death**\nThe people do not commonly fear death,\nhow could one use the **Dao** of death to frighten them?\nIf one makes the people fear death,\nand they commit extraordinary acts,\nI might seize and kill them—\nwho would dare?\n\nThere are always those appointed to kill who kill.\nIf one substitutes for those appointed to kill,\nthis is called substituting for the Master Carpenter to wield the axe.\n\nIf one substitutes for the Master Carpenter to wield the axe,\nthere are few who do not injure their own hands.\n\nThe Classic states: The people originally do not fear death,\nhow could one use the **Dao** of death to frighten them?\nIf one makes the people fear death,\nand they commit extraordinary acts,\none assumes I might seize and kill them—\nwho would dare to face this?\n\nThere are always those appointed to kill who kill.\nIf one substitutes for those appointed to kill,\nthis is called substituting for the Master Carpenter to wield the axe.\nIf one substitutes for the Master Carpenter to wield the axe,\nthere are few who do not injure their own hands.\n\nThe **Dao** says: Returning to the origin and reversing to the end,\none knows the explanation of death and life.\nAll under Heaven know that life has death,\njust as night and day must follow—\nthis is ignorance of the **Dao** that life contains death,\nand death contains life.\n\nThe people who do not commonly fear death,\ndo not know the **Dao** of life.\nIf one makes them know there is life,\nwho would not fear death?\nHence, in human nature,\nboldness in daring leads to death.\n\nHow could one use the **Dao** of death to frighten them?\nThis is to make them know the **Dao** of death.\nIf one makes them know the **Dao** of death,\nwho would not rejoice in life?\nHence, in human undertakings,\nboldness in not daring leads to life.\n\nIf one assumes I might seize and kill them—\nwho would dare to face this?\nThere is always the **Dao** of Nature itself,\nso those appointed to kill will surely kill those who should die.\nHeaven and Earth create all things—\nthose who should not die will not be killed,\nthis is the appointed order.\n\nIf one substitutes for those appointed to kill,\nthis is human effort and artificial action—\nit is like substituting for the Master Carpenter\nwho swings the axe with the wind’s force to fell timber.\n\nIf one substitutes for the Master Carpenter to wield the axe,\nif they truly possess the Master Carpenter’s skill,\nthey will exhaust the adze’s blade yet not harm their nose.\nIf they merely substitute and act in place,\nhow could they not exhaust the adze’s blade,\nand even those who do not harm their own hands are few indeed?\n\n**Virtue** says: If the people do not fear **威** (awe),\nthen the greatest **威** will arrive.\nThus, the **Dao** of awe is set,\nso the people do not weary of it.\n\nIf the people do not fear death,\nthen the greatest death will arrive.\nThus, the **Dao** of death is set,\nso the people know to fear.\n\nIf the people do not commonly fear death,\nhow could one use the **Dao** of death to frighten them?\nBy this reasoning,\npeople originally do fear death.\n\nIf one makes the people fear death,\nHeaven and Earth’s natural creation\nwill surely not allow one to kill those who should not die.\nThus, those who commit extraordinary acts against the **Dao**,\neven Heaven and Earth’s creation cannot kill them—\nif one assumes they can be seized and killed,\nwho would dare to face this?\n\nAs for those appointed to kill who kill,\nthey also kill those who originally did not fear death\nand should die.\nBut those who fear death and should not die—\nhow could one seize and kill them?\n\nThose who substitute for the officials of death\nare even worse than those with fixed punishments—\nthis is called substituting for the master carpenter to hew wood.\nEven the wheelwright Ruòbiàn finds this difficult,\nlet alone the chisels and mallets.\nFew escape uninjured hands.\n\n**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\nThus, the people suffer hunger.\nThe people are hard to govern because their rulers act excessively.\nThus, they are hard to govern.\nThe people grow indifferent to death because their pursuit of life is excessive.\nThus, they grow indifferent to death.\nOnly those who do not make life their concern\nare truly superior to those who prize life.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\nThus, the people suffer hunger.\nThe people are hard to govern because their rulers act excessively.\nThus, they are hard to govern.\nThe people grow indifferent to death because their pursuit of life is excessive.\nThus, they grow indifferent to death.\nOnly those who do not make life their concern\nare superior to those who prize life.\n\nThe *Way* says:\nThe kitchen has fat meat,\nthe stables have fat horses,\nyet the people show signs of hunger,\nand the fields are strewn with starving corpses—\nthis is to drive beasts while letting people starve.\nEven beasts would abhor devouring one another,\nso how can those who rule stand idly by\nwhile their people starve to death?\nThus, it is said:\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers consuming too much of their taxes.\nIf I do nothing, the people will transform themselves.\nIf I love stillness, the people will align themselves—\nlike water, which can bear a boat\nor overturn it.\nWhen laws are pushed to extremes, deceit arises;\nwhen orders are issued, trickery follows.\nThus, the people are hard to govern\nbecause their rulers act excessively.\nIf the ruler does nothing, the world will govern itself.\nThose who love excessively must spend excessively,\nand those who hoard excessively will lose excessively.\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace,\nknowing limits brings no peril.\nThis is how one endures long.\nThus, the people grow indifferent to death\nbecause their pursuit of life is excessive.\nOnly those who make the *Dao* their master\nand do not make life their concern\nare even more superior to those who prize life—\nis this not clear?\n\nThe *Virtue* says:\nWhat the ruler favors, the people will follow to excess.\nThe spirit loves clarity, yet the mind disturbs it;\nthe mind loves stillness, yet desires drag it.\nIf one constantly dismisses desire, the mind will still itself;\nif one clarifies the mind, the spirit will purify itself.\nThus, the six desires will not arise,\nand the three poisons will vanish.\n\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers consuming too much of their taxes.\nThus, the people suffer hunger.\nThe people’s *qi* weakens when their virtue is disordered.\nThus, their *qi* weakens.\nThe people are hard to govern because their rulers act excessively;\n*qi* is hard to nurture because the mind is unsettled.\nThe people grow indifferent to death because their pursuit of life is excessive;\npeople grow indifferent to death because their cultivation of life is shallow.\nOnly those who do not make seeking life their concern,\nbut instead make cultivating life their sole concern—\nthough the path of seeking life is indeed precious,\nthe path of cultivating life is far superior to seeking life.\nThus, it is said: *This is superior to prizing life.*\n\n**Chapter 76: The People’s Birth**\nThe people’s birth is soft and weak,\nyet their death is rigid and strong.\nAll things—grasses and trees—\nbegin soft and tender,\nyet end withered and brittle.\nThus, rigidity and strength belong to death,\nwhile softness and weakness belong to life.\nTherefore, strong armies do not conquer,\nand strong trees are felled.\nThe strong and mighty dwell below,\nthe soft and weak dwell above.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nWhen people are born, they are soft and weak;\nwhen they die, they are rigid and strong.\nAll things—grasses and trees—\nin their birth are soft and tender,\nyet in their death are withered and brittle.\nThus, rigidity and strength belong to death,\nwhile softness and weakness belong to life.\nTherefore, strong armies do not conquer,\nand strong trees are felled.\nThus, the strong and mighty dwell below,\nthe soft and weak dwell above.\n\nThe *Way* says:\nWater, though the gentlest, does not empty the four seas,\nyet mountains, though the firmest, will eventually erode.\nThus, what is supremely soft in the world\novercomes what is supremely hard,\nand what is supremely weak\novercomes what is supremely strong.\nTherefore, when people are born, they are soft and weak,\nyet when they die, they are rigid and strong.\nAs for all things—grasses and trees—\nin their beginning, they are soft and tender,\nso *Zhen* and *Xùn* govern them,\nand even barren or salty lands\nreturn to life and rise to the empty heights—\nthere is no doubt.\nWhen they near death, they become rigid and strong,\nso *Kǎn* and *Lǐ* govern them,\nand their hearts become hard,\ntheir branches withered and brittle.\nThus, it is said:\nRigidity and strength belong to death,\nwhile softness and weakness belong to life.\nTherefore, strong armies do not conquer,\nand strong trees are felled—\nas when a woodcutter fells a tree.\nThus, the strong and mighty dwell below,\nthe soft and weak dwell above.\n\n*Zhen* and *Duì* are the yin of Heaven.\n*Xùn* and *Gèn* are the yang of Earth.\nHeaven, in terms of birth, has yin above and yang below—\nthe principle of mutual harmony.\nEarth, in terms of completion, has yang above and yin below—\nthe principle of rank and order.\nThus, when Earth is above Heaven, it is *Tài* (harmony),\nand when Heaven is above Earth, it is *Pǐ* (blockage).\nTherefore, the strong and mighty dwell below,\nthe soft and weak dwell above—\nthis is the principle of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *Virtue* says:\n*Kūn* and *Lián* intermingle to produce *Kǎn* and *Lǐ*.\n*Kǎn* originates from *Kūn*’s body,\ntaking the central *yáng* line of *Lián*—\nthus, it is called the \"central male.\"\n*Lǐ* originates from *Lián*’s body,\ntaking the central *yīn* line of *Kūn*—\nthus, it is called the \"central female.\"\n*Kǎn* is externally yin and internally yang—\nthus, it is the \"central male.\"\n*Lǐ* is externally yang and internally yin—\nthus, it is the \"central female.\"\nThe male is externally yang and internally yin—\nthe symbol of *Lǐ*’s fire.\nThe female is externally yin and internally yang—\nthe symbol of *Kǎn*’s water.\nThis is what is meant by:\n*The sun and moon shine together,\nand water and fire are inverted.*\n\nIn essence, those who nurture life\nmust take the single *yáng* within *Kǎn*\nand return the single *yīn* within *Lǐ*.\nThus, the Purple Sage says:\n*\"Take the central substance of the *Kǎn* position,\nand transmute the inner yin of the *Lǐ* palace.\"*\n\nFrom here, the body becomes the robust *Kūn*—\nits hidden leaps and ascents all depend on the mind.\n\nFor this reason:\nHuman life begins in softness—\nthe *yīn* within *Lǐ*.\nAt death, the heart grows rigid—\nthe single *yáng* within *Kǎn*.\n*Yīn* governs death—how then does it speak of life?\n*Yáng* governs life—how then does it speak of death?\nWithout inversion, without reversal,\nit would not be called the *Dao*.\n\nIndeed, *yīn* without *yáng* cannot generate,\n*yáng* without *yīn* cannot perish—\nthis is to rob Heaven and Earth of their transformations.\nThus, inversion is necessary—\neven for all things, plants, and grasses.\n\nTherefore, the strong descend while the weak ascend,\n*yīn* above, *yáng* rushing beneath—\nits meaning is profound indeed.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seventh: The Way of Heaven**\nThe *Dao* of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high are pressed down, the low are raised,\nthe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nThe *Dao* of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,\nbut the *Dao* of humanity is otherwise:\nit diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can use the excessive to nourish the world?\nOnly the *Dao*-bearer.\n\nThus, the Sage acts without claiming,\nachieves without dwelling—\nnot desiring to be seen as virtuous.\nThe *Classic* says:\n*The *Dao* of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high must be pressed down, the low must be raised,\nthe excessive must be diminished, the deficient must be supplemented.\nThe *Dao* of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,\nbut the *Dao* of humanity is otherwise:\nit diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho diminishes the excessive to nourish the world?\nOnly the *Dao*-bearer can do so.\n\nThus, the Sage acts in *wuwei* yet does not rely on it,\nachieves without taking credit—\nnot desiring to display virtue or praise.\nThe *Dao* says:\n*The *Dao* of Heaven is round and divine,\nembracing the great earth,\ngiving birth and completing all things—\nthe image of a drawn bow.\nThe Heaven above the earth\nalways uses half its arc—\nthe image of a released bow.\nThe high are pressed down, the low are raised—\nthis is the sun yielding to the moon,\nthe moon yielding to the sun,\nday and moon pushing against each other, generating brightness.\nCold yielding to heat, heat yielding to cold,\ncold and heat pushing against each other, completing the year.\n\nThe excessive are diminished—\nautumn harvest, winter storage.\nThe deficient are supplemented—\nspring growth, summer flourishing.\nThis is called the *Dao* of Heaven:\ndiminishing the excessive and supplementing the deficient,\ngathering the abundant and aiding the scarce,\nbalancing things and applying evenly.\n\nBut the *Dao* of humanity is otherwise:\nthe deficient are diminished—\nthe people’s hunger.\nThe excessive are served—\nthe ruler’s heavy taxes.\nThis is called the *Dao* of humanity:\ndiminishing the deficient to serve the excessive,\nplundering the low to raise the high,\nsevering the short to lengthen the long.\n\nHaving diminished the deficient to serve the excessive,\nwho can then use the excessive to nourish the world’s deficiencies?\nOnly the *Dao*-bearer can do so.\nThus, the Sage acts in *wuwei* yet does not serve himself,\nachieves without taking residence—\nnot desiring to display virtue or praise,\nyet causing the Great *Dao* to lean toward nourishment,\npreventing excess and deficiency.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eighth: The World’s Gentleness**\nNowhere is the world’s gentleness and weakness greater than in water,\nyet nothing can surpass it in overcoming hardness.\nCaution—do not treat it lightly.\nThe weak overcoming the strong, the gentle overcoming the firm—\nall know this, yet none can practice it.\n\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"To bear a nation’s filth is to be its sovereign;\nto bear a nation’s misfortune is to be its king.\"*\nStraight speech inverted.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Nowhere is the world’s gentleness and weakness greater than in water,\nyet nothing can surpass it in overcoming hardness—\ncaution, do not treat it lightly.\nThe weak overcoming the strong, the gentle overcoming the firm—\nall know this, yet none can practice it.\nThus, the Sage says:\nTo bear a nation’s filth is to be its sovereign;\nto bear a nation’s misfortune is to be its king.\nTo bear filth and rule, to bear misfortune and reign—\nthe Sage’s straight speech is inverted.\"*\n\nThe *Dao* says:\n*Kǎn* is extreme gentleness—\nits water ascends and descends between Heaven and Earth.\n*Kūn* is slight gentleness—\nits earth gives birth and completes all things.\nYet the earth of *Kūn* shapes all things,\nwhile the water of *Kǎn* circulates their *qi*.\nThus, what moistens all things is nothing like water—\nhence, the world’s gentleness and weakness are nowhere greater than in water.\nIts water and *qi* flow without entering,\nyet flow without failing to conquer—\nwhile overcoming hardness, nothing can surpass it.\nCaution—do not treat its water lightly.\nWater, water—\nthus it is said: *It cannot be replaced.*\n\nThe *Dao* of weakness overcoming strength, of gentleness conquering rigidity—\nthe world knows this well, yet none can practice it.\nHow then could one treat its water as trifling?\n\nGreat indeed is the *Dao* of water’s timely virtue.\n\nThus the Sage declares:\nTo bear a nation’s filth and humiliation—\nthis is called the sovereign of the *altars of soil and grain* (社稷).\nTo bear a nation’s calamities—\nthis is called the king of the world.\nWater embodies this *symbol* (象).\n\nWeakness overcoming strength, gentleness conquering rigidity,\nbearing filth to rule, enduring calamity to reign—\nall are *straight speech inverted* (正言若反).\n\nThe *virtue/power* (德) says:\nTrue *essence* (精) is most gentle,\ntrue *qi* most feeble—\n*Kǎn*’s water conceals them,\nall bearing names yet no form,\nthe sovereign of the body.\n\nOnce the *essence* and *qi* are exhausted,\nthough bones and sinews claim firmness,\nsoon they become dung and dust.\n\nBy this reasoning,\nthe world’s gentleness and feebleness\nnowhere surpass water’s,\nyet none can conquer hardness as it does.\nWho dares to belittle and despise it?\n\nThus it is said: *It cannot be replaced.*\nThe *Dao* of water’s gentleness overcoming strength,\nof gentleness conquering rigidity—\nthe world knows this truth,\nyet none can enact its practice.\nGreat indeed is water’s *Dao* as the *Way*.\n\nThus the Sage declares:\nTo bear a nation’s filth and humiliation—\nthis is weakness overcoming strength,\nweakness overcoming strength—\nthis is called the sovereign of the *altars of soil and grain*.\nTo bear a nation’s calamities—\nthis is gentleness conquering rigidity,\ngentleness conquering rigidity—\nthis is called the king of the world.\nAll are *straight speech inverted*.\n(*Chapter Seventy-Nine: Harmonizing Great Grievances*)\n\nTo reconcile great grievances, there must remain lingering resentment—\nhow then can it be called good?\n\nThus the Sage holds the left contract,\nyet does not demand recompense from others.\n\nTherefore, those of *virtue* oversee the contract,\nwhile those without oversee the law.\n\nThe *Dao* of Heaven favors none,\nalways aligning with those of goodness.\n\nThe *sutra* says:\nTo reconcile great grievances, there must remain lingering resentment—\nhow then can it be called good?\n\nAuspicious matters favor the left,\ncontracts replacing cords and bonds.\nThus the Sage always holds the auspicious covenant,\nyet does not demand recompense from others.\n\nTherefore, those of *virtue* oversee the contract,\nwhile those without oversee the law.\n\n*Simpai* (彻) is the law.\n\nThe *Dao* of Heaven favors none,\nalways aligning with those of goodness.\n\nThe *Way* declares:\nGoodly closures require no bolt or bar yet cannot be opened,\ngoodly bindings require no cord or knot yet cannot be undone.\nWhen great enmity has already formed and is then resolved,\nthere must remain lingering enmity—\nhow then can it be called trustworthy?\nWhen great resentment has already manifested and is then reconciled,\nthere must remain lingering resentment—\nhow then can it be called good?\n\nThus the Sage holds the left contract,\nsaying: goodly bindings require no cord or knot yet cannot be undone,\nand does not demand from others—\nthis is called goodly closures requiring no bolt or bar yet cannot be opened.\nOnly those of *virtue* can oversee the contract,\nwhile those without *virtue* merely oversee the law.\n\nThus the Imperial Heaven favors none,\nonly *virtue* does it assist;\nthe *Dao* of Heaven favors none,\nalways aligning with those of goodness.\n\n*Virtue* says:\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite, sweet dew descends,\nwhen Yin and Yang harmonize, winds and rains come in season—\nthe beginning of *yīn-yáng*’s *sūn-yǐ* (损益) and flourishing decline.\n\nWhen three Yangs emerge from Earth, it is *Tāi* (泰) of Earth-Heaven,\nEarth-Heaven *Tāi* in square form—\nthree above intersecting, diminishing its flourishing.\nWhen three Yins emerge from Earth, it is *Pǐ* (否) of Heaven-Earth,\nHeaven-Earth *Pǐ* in square form—\nthe first four intersecting, augmenting its decline.\n\nThus it is said: the beginning of *sūn-yǐ* and flourishing decline.\n\nThus *Tāi* can generate things,\nI can complete things,\nso that all things under Heaven constantly lament\nthat Heaven and Earth do not practice *sūn-yǐ*.\n\nGreat as Heaven and Earth, small as all things,\nall rely on *yīn-yáng* to form their vessels—\nhow much more so for humanity?\n\nWhen Yang leads and Yin harmonizes,\nthis is called man and wife dwelling together.\nWhen Yang leads and Yin defies,\nthis is called husband and wife turning against each other—\nhow much more so for great grievances?\n\nWhen great grievance has already formed,\nthen to reconcile it—\nto reconcile and provoke resentment,\nthere must remain lingering resentment.\nWith lingering resentment,\nhow then can it be called good?\n\nWhen great resentment has already manifested,\nthen to save it—\nto save and provoke anger,\nthere must remain lingering anger.\nWith lingering anger,\nhow then can it be called aid?\n\nThus the Sage always holds the left contract,\nto overcome strength with weakness,\nnot demanding from others,\nto overcome rigidity with gentleness.\n\nThose of *virtue* oversee the contract, holding to gentleness.\nThose without *virtue* oversee the law, holding to rigidity.\n\nThus the *Dao* of Heaven does not falter,\nalways aligning with the left contract;\nthe *Dao* of Heaven favors none,\nalways aligning with those of goodness.\n\n---\n*Chapter Eighty: Small States, Few People*\n\nSmall states, though few in people,\neach hundred or ten has its leader,\npeople merely use tools yet do not serve the state.\nThey value death and do not flee far.\n\nThough there are boats and chariots,\nthey have no use for them;\nthough there are armor and weapons,\nthey have no need to display them.\nThey return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\n\nThey find their food sweet,\ntheir clothing fine,\ntheir dwellings secure,\ntheir customs joyous.\n\nNeighboring states are visible to one another,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs heard between them.\nPeople die of old age\nwithout ever visiting one another.\n\nThe *sutra* says:\nSmall states, though few in people,\neach hundred or ten has its leader,\npeople merely use tools yet do not serve the state.\nThey value death and do not flee far.\n\nThough there are boats and chariots,\nthey have no use for them;\nthough there are armor and weapons,\nthey have no need to display them;\n\nThey return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\nTheir food is sweet, their clothing fine,\ntheir dwellings secure, their customs joyous.\n\nNeighboring states lie in sight of one another,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs heard across them,\nyet people grow old and die\nwithout ever knowing of public or private affairs between them.\n\nThe *Dao* says:\nTang ruled with seventy *li*, King Wen with a hundred *li*,\nyet both held sway over the world—\nboth were small states with few people.\n\nThus, when boundaries were properly set\nand the *jing* fields evenly distributed,\neach commoner and housewife received a hundred *mu* of land,\nand people were given leaders by tens and hundreds,\nyet they did not lend or borrow from one another.\n\nThen, the stipends of high, middle, and low officials were equalized,\nand people were merely used as tools,\nnot conscripted for state service—\nhence, \"they are used as tools yet not for state purposes,\"\nleading people to value death and not flee far.\n\nThough there are boats and chariots,\nthey have no place to go and ride them;\nthough there are armor and weapons,\nthey have no direction to deploy them;\nthey return to the ancient practice of knotted cords.\n\nThey till the fields and fish,\nand their food is sweet.\nThey wear coarse hemp and bound shoes,\nand their clothing is fine.\nThey dwell in caves and live in the wild,\nand their homes are secure.\nThey drum their bellies and strike the earth,\nand their customs are joyous.\n\nNeighboring states lie in sight of one another,\nthe crowing of roosters and barking of dogs heard across them,\nreaching to the four borders,\nyet people grow old and die\nwithout knowing of public or private affairs between them.\n\nThe *virtue/power* says:\nWealth and nobility bring security to the people—\nthis is when their *qi* is full and their *jing* abundant.\nSmall states with few people—\nthis is when their *qi* is weak and their *jing* depleted.\n\nThough their *qi* is weak and their *jing* depleted,\nthere is still a way to restore decline and renew old age.\nUp to a hundred and twenty years, one may yet return,\nbut beyond that, refining true sincerity becomes difficult—\none must rely on the nine-turns, eight-essence elixir,\nthe luminous essence of sun and moon to heal the aged and infirm—\nhow much more so for the small states with few people?\n\nThose whose *qi* is weak and *jing* depleted\nare the people who have exhausted the sixty-four *gua*.\nThey must first ensure each of the five *zang* and six *fu* has its master—\nthis is the *Yellow Court Inner Classic*.\nHence, \"they have leaders by tens and hundreds.\"\n\nThough one may set up furnaces and cauldrons,\nit is merely for nurturing the medicine,\ndaring not to smelt, refine, or decoct—\nhence, \"they are used as tools yet not put to use.\"\nThey build elixir chambers and place cauldrons and vessels,\npreserving them with care, using them sparingly,\nso that people value death and do not flee far.\n\nThough there are swift boats and racing chariots,\nthey have no place to ride them;\nthough there are strong armor and sharp weapons,\nthey have no direction to deploy them.\n\nThe people return to using knotted cords for reckoning.\n\nThis is called restoring the art of secure closure—\nlocks without bars that cannot be opened,\nknots without cords that cannot be undone.\nIs this not profound?\n\nThus, under Heaven’s great peace, one becomes a noble of the Primordial Sovereign,\ndelighting in their food, admiring their garments,\ndwelling in ease, rejoicing in their customs,\nwhere the Twelve Palaces address one another as *ér* and *rú* in forgetfulness.\nNeighboring lands face each other,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs intermingling—\nthe Twelve Channels harmonizing within and without.\n\nIf such harmony is attained,\nuntil one’s natural end, with no further mingling with the vulgar world,\nis this not fitting?\n\n*\"True words are not ornate\"* (Chapter 81)\nTrue words are not ornate; ornate words are not true.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not erudite; the erudite are not wise.\nThe sage does not hoard—\ngiving to others, the more they possess;\nsharing with others, the more they have.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;\nThe sage’s Dao acts without contention.\nThe Classic says:\nTrue words are not ornate; ornate words are not true.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not erudite; the erudite are not wise.\nThe sage’s clarity is boundless—\nwhat need has it for accumulation?\nGiving to others, the more they possess;\nsharing with others, the more they have.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;\nThe sage’s Dao acts without contention.\nThe *Dao* declares:\nWhen spoken, its flavor is faint and insipid.\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned, benevolence and righteousness arise;\nWhen wisdom emerges, great deceit follows.\nTrue words are not ornate.\nLight promises bring few fulfillments;\nmany easy things bring many difficulties—\nornate words are not true.\nAll things rely on it to thrive yet it makes no claim;\nwhen the work is done, it takes no credit—\nthe virtuous do not argue.\nIts governance is subtle, yet its people are simple;\nthose who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise do not speak; the wise are not erudite.\nThose who speak are not wise; the erudite are not wise.\n\nThe sage’s Dao resides in the Supreme Ultimate,\na boundless clarity of *qi*, possessing all things—\nthus it does not hoard.\nUsing this Dao for others, one’s own abundance increases;\nsharing this Dao with others, one’s own wealth multiplies.\nThus, the Dao of Heaven benefits without harming—\nnone under Heaven can harm it.\nThe sage’s Dao acts without contention—\nnone under Heaven can contend with it.\n\n*Virtue* declares:\nTrue words are not ornate—this is the Great Dao of non-action.\nOrnate words are not true—these are minor, tangential arts.\nThe virtuous do not argue—few are the words of the fortunate.\nThose who argue are not virtuous—their words are many and hasty.\nThe wise are not erudite—they grasp the One through which all things pass.\nThe erudite are not wise—they rely on memorization and inquiry.\n\nThe sage’s Dao need not accumulate much—\nthe One generates the Two,\nthe Two generate the Three,\nthe Three generate all things—this suffices.\n\nWhen this Dao is given to others,\nothers become oneself;\nwhen all are oneself,\none’s own abundance grows.\nWhen this Dao is shared with others,\nothers become oneself;\nwhen all are oneself,\none’s own wealth multiplies.\n\nThus, the Dao of Primordial Heaven\nbenefits all under Heaven without harming others—\nall clothe themselves in its teachings.\nThe sage’s Dao\nacts for all under Heaven without contention—\nall are adorned by its virtue.\nWhen *Dao* and *virtue* clothe all under Heaven,\nthe achievements of the Primordial Sage are complete.\n\n---\n*[End of the Fourth Scroll of the Three

      "translated_text": "The learning of Wang and Xie borrows the guise of abstruse discourse. Yet this is not the case where \"the benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom\"—it is precisely what the Five Hegemons did, using empty names to seize real profit. How then can one perceive the heart of Laozi? Now, in the leisure between studying the *Zhouyi* and the *Analects*, with remaining strength, I have reverently followed the chapter and verse of the *Daode*, dividing it into three interpretations. Thus, one knows that heaven and earth are vast, yet creation is one, emerging from the sage—acting without action. Is its purport not profound?\n\nThe first interpretation, \"Scripture,\" merely adjusts the punctuation of the original text, adding or removing one or two function words, so that the reader first grasps the righteousness of each chapter, naturally complete and without flaw.\n\nThe second interpretation, \"Dao,\" directly expounds the great Dao of heaven and earth, its beginning and end, origin and return, its numbers and principles fitting like tallying tokens.\n\nThe third interpretation, \"Virtue,\" interweaves qian and kun, inverts water and fire, aligns east-metal with west-wood, coagulates mercury and congeals lead—every movement and stillness harmonizing with the great Dao.\n\nIn total, over fifty thousand words, titled *Three Interpretations*. The *Daodejing* aligns with the *Great Change*; where it cannot accommodate the heart-mind, the sages before and after remain of one measure. Laozi’s single work takes true constancy as its essence. Yet commentators have blended it entirely with Dao and virtue, unaware of guest and host, superior and inferior, leading Confucians to recklessly generate divergent views, with no distinction to separate them.\n\nHere, I first set forth the *Three Hundred Characters on True Constancy*, matching the number of the *Yinfu*, arranging them in the preface, so that later scholars of Dao and virtue may not stray far from their return.\n\nScholars of the four directions who verify the Dao, peruse and examine this work—if there is anything worthy of adoption, it would suffice for this humble woodcutter to hear his name.\n\nPreface by Deng Qi, the Jade Guest, in the autumn of the *wuxu* year of the Dade reign (1308).\n\n**Three Hundred Characters on True Constancy**\n\nThe constancy of true constancy is called constancy;\nThe truth of true truth is called truth.\nTrue constancy in the Dao embraces all;\nTrue constancy in virtue regulates all;\nTrue constancy in life determines all;\nTrue constancy in nature responds to all;\nTrue constancy in principle governs all.\n\nBefore heaven and earth began, true constancy truly abides;\nAfter heaven and earth end, true constancy truly empties.\nAll things bear yin and embrace yang;\nThe sage thereby possesses constancy.\nThe great Dao can decay yet not renew;\nThe sage thereby possesses truth.\nIf truth had form, it would be boundless and void;\nIf constancy had a name, it would be bodiless yet present.\n\nThe Dao is constantly without action yet nothing is left undone;\nThe true Dao is empty and follows, yet nothing follows it.\nWhen the sage ascends to the utmost, he is true, merging with the Dao in truth.\nAbove and below have no constancy; movement and stillness have constancy.\nQian begins by benefiting all under heaven with beauty and profit, yet does not speak of what it profits;\nWater benefits all things with beauty and profit, yet does not speak of its virtue.\n\nActing for the sake of action loses truth;\nNot employing it returns to constancy.\nThe sun and moon alternate to generate light;\nCold and heat alternate to complete the year—\nThus true constancy has no form or name.\nThe Dao of heaven speaks not yet reveals its merit;\nThe Dao of earth achieves not yet succeeds in its end—\nThus true constancy is not empty nothingness.\n\nEmptiness and nothingness succeed one another;\nHeaven and earth have no substance.\nWithout emptiness, without substance,\nOne returns to the limitless.\nWithout limit, without boundary,\nTrue constancy then rests.\nThe rest of true constancy is profoundly without rest;\nThe rest without rest—\nTrue constancy then ceases.\nThe cessation of true constancy is profoundly without cessation;\nThe cessation without cessation—\nUtterly unattainable, utterly unlosable.\nThus true constancy does not vainly cease.\n\n**The Great Transmission of Laozi**\n\nLaozi was a native of Quren Village, Lixiang, Ku County in Chu. His surname was Li, given name Er, courtesy name Boyang, posthumous name Dan. He was the keeper of archives in Zhou. When Confucius visited Zhou, he was about to inquire about ritual from Laozi.\n\nLaozi said: \"What you speak of—the man and his bones have already decayed; only his words remain. Moreover, when the noble person meets his time, he mounts his carriage; when he does not meet his time, he drifts like tumbleweed. I have heard that a good merchant hides his wealth as if empty, and a noble person of great virtue appears foolish. Rid yourself of your arrogance, excessive desires, affected demeanor, and extravagant ambitions—these are all of no benefit to your person. What I have to tell you is only this.\"\n\nThe *Family Sayings* and *Observing Zhou* record this in detail.",

      "translated_text": "Confucius departed and said to his disciples: \"Birds—I know they can fly; fish—I know they can swim; beasts—I know they can run. Those that run may be caught in nets, those that swim may be caught with lines, those that fly may be struck down with arrows. But as for the dragon, I cannot know it—how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend the heavens. Today I have seen Laozi—is he not like the dragon?\n\nLaozi cultivated the Dao and its virtue, taking concealment and namelessness as his practice. He dwelled long in Zhou, but seeing its decline, he departed. When he reached the pass, the Keeper of the Pass, Yin Xi, said: 'You are about to withdraw from the world—compel yourself to write a book for me.' Thereupon Laozi composed a work in two scrolls, expounding the meaning of the Dao and its virtue in over five thousand words, then left. None knew where he ended.\n\nSome say Lao Laizi was also a man of Chu, who wrote fifteen scrolls on the application of the Daoist teachings, and was a contemporary of Confucius. Laozi was said to have lived over one hundred and sixty years, or even over two hundred, due to his cultivation of the Dao and nurturing of longevity.\n\nOne hundred and twenty-nine years after Confucius’ death, the Grand Historian Tan of Zhou met Duke Xian of Qin and said: 'At first, Qin and Zhou were united, then parted; after five hundred years they will unite again, and after seventy years a hegemon-king will arise.' Some say Dan was Laozi himself; others say he was not. The world knows not whether this is so or not.\n\nLaozi was a reclusive gentleman. Laozi’s son was named Zong, who became a general of Wei and was enfeoffed at Duan’gan. Zong’s son was Zhu; Zhu’s son was Gong; Gong’s great-great-grandson was Jia, who served under Emperor Wen of Han. At that time, Jia’s son Jie was Grand Tutor to King Gong of Jiaoxi and thus settled his family in Qi.\n\nThose who study Laozi disparage the Confucians, and the Confucians likewise disparage Laozi. 'The Dao differs—there is no shared counsel between them.' Could this be what is meant?\n\nLi Er embodied non-action and self-transformation, purity and self-rectification.\n\nThe Left Immortal Duke Ge Xuan said: In the Zhou era, Laozi once manifested as a divine being. His mother gave birth to him by splitting open her left armpit, and at birth he was radiant, thus named 'Supreme.' Emerging through the Mystery, he existed before heaven and earth, without age or decline, hence called 'Supreme'—the incarnate form of the Three Pure Ones.\n\n**The Orthodox Lineage of the Great Dao**\n\nThe teaching of the Mysterious School takes purity, emptiness, and the Correct Unity as its essence, and immortality as its joy. Thus, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Floating Radiance, after countless kalpas, attained the Three Pure Ones. And from the Three Pure Ones, after countless millennia, he descended as Laozi to deliver the Perfected One Yin Xi. Through Immortal Minister Li Yi, spanning ten generations from Zhou to Han, the transmission continued.\n\nThereafter, the Venerable Man of the River emerged. From Anqisheng, through nine transmissions, it reached the Three Yangs, extending into the Five Dynasties. From the time the Three Yangs first proclaimed the Dao, through the lineage of the True Man Hai Chan, it passed to Zhang Ziyang, then to Wang Chongyang. Ziyang transmitted it to Cui Xuan; Cui Xuan to Zi Xian; Zi Xian to Cui Xu; Cui Xu to Hai Qiong—nine transmissions in all for the Master. Wang Chongyang’s transmission branched into the Seven Perfected, with countless hidden connections, collateral teachings, and universal deliverance—numbering in the millions. As for the orthodox transmission of the Great Dao, it has now reached the thirty-fifth generation in Master Hai Qiong.\n\nOnly the sages of antiquity enjoyed extended lifespans, their years and kalpas immeasurably long. From the middle ancient era, Heaven did not withhold the Dao, spreading it among humanity to deliver countless beings. The span of its transmission to the present is likewise incalculable.\n\nAfter Hai Qiong, the singular thread of the Great Dao passed to the Master of Crane Forest, who revived the lost learning of the former sages and established the Dharma-gate for later generations. In leisure, reflecting on the difficulty of transmission and tracing its origins, I have set forth its lineage and committed it to print.\n\nTingzhi, humbly numbered among the disciples of the Master of Crane Forest, now burns incense, bows deeply, and records this. Written on the winter solstice of the *gengshen* year by disciple Xiao Tingzhi.\n\n**The Chronology of the Great Dao**\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Floating Radiance is the Dao that generates the Supreme Ultimate. After thirty-two thousand four hundred years, it reached the Jade Pure Primordial Heavenly Worthy—'the Dao generates the One,' hence matched with Fuxi, the Heavenly Sovereign. After another ten thousand eight hundred years, it reached the Supreme Pure Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy—'the One generates the Two,' hence matched with Shennong, the Earthly Sovereign. After another ten thousand eight hundred years, it reached the Grand Pure Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and its Virtue—'the Two generates the Three,' hence matched with Xuanyuan, the Human Sovereign.\n\nThe Grand Pure Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and its Virtue, together with the Supreme Primordial Lady, transmitted the precelestial Great Dao—'the Three generates the myriad things,' hence matched with the seventy-two masters led by Master Guangcheng. After another one thousand nine hundred years, it reached the Highest Laozi, at which time the Compassionate Sage was also born into the world. 'The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,' and the division of yin and yang established the Two Modes. Thus, the seventy-two worthies led by the Great Sage Confucius were matched with them. 'The qi of harmony is the mean'—encompassing the Three Powers and doubling them.\n\nThe Three Teachings stood like the legs of a tripod in the world, and the Dao of kings and lords was complete. Thus it is said: 'Things may be diminished yet benefit, or increased yet suffer harm.' 'What others teach, I also teach.' 'The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death—I shall take this as the father of my teaching.' The chronology of the Great Dao fits like tallying tokens. The orthodoxy and its lineage are known to those who understand.\n\nRecorded by the Perfected One of Mount Qingcheng.\n\n**The Three Explanations of the *Dao and Its Virtue*: Scroll One**\n**Jade Guest Deng Qi’s Explanation**\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the constant name.\nNameless—it is the beginning of heaven and earth;\nNamed—it is the mother of the myriad things.\nAlways desireless, one observes its mystery;\nAlways desiring, one observes its manifestations.",

Profound and yet more profound: the gateway to all mysteries.\n\nThe Dao declares: \"Without thought, without action—this is called the constant Dao. Spiritually wondrous and unified in governance—this is called the constant name.\" The Dao is the central emptiness of the Great Ultimate. The name is the great image of heaven and earth. Within the central emptiness of the Great Ultimate, what Dao is absent? Yet when divided among the myriad things, each possesses its own Dao. How can the Dao of a single thing encompass the whole? Unable to encompass the whole, one imposes names by force—such forced naming is not the constant Dao. Within the great image of heaven and earth, what name is absent? Yet when manifested in the myriad things, each bears its own name. How can the name of a single thing encompass all? Unable to encompass all, one imposes names by force—such forced naming is not the constant name.\n\nBefore heaven and earth were born, what name could there be at the beginningless beginning? Once the myriad things are formed, without the mother, what shape could there be? To observe its mystery, there is the Dao of constant non-being. To observe its manifestations, there is the Dao of constant being. These two emerge together from non-thought and non-action, bearing different names in the spiritually wondrous and unified—thus they are called the profound. Profound and yet more profound: the gateway to all mysteries. Those who ascend the hall, enter the chamber, and preside over the innermost—are they not the sages?\n\nThe *Virtue* states: \"When male and female are yet to unite, only essence and oneness hold fast to the center.\" The Dao that cannot be spoken abides in the constant Dao; the name that cannot be named abides in the constant name. Nameless—it is the beginning of heaven and earth. Everlasting are husband and wife, male and female dwelling together, the great human bond, embracing the infant. The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Named—it is the mother of the myriad things. Ceasing to speak of male above and female below, all things transform from negation. Always desireless, one thereby observes its mystery. Yielding and moving, hardness and softness respond in kind, all things transform from peace. Always desiring, one thereby observes its subtleties.\n\nThat by which heaven and earth become heaven and earth is the constant Dao. That by which male and female become heaven and earth is the constant name. These two converge yet follow different paths, emerge from the same source yet bear different names; governed by one principle yet with a hundred considerations, they diverge yet share the same name. Thus it is said: both are termed the profound. Profound and yet more profound: the gateway to all mysteries. To enter the gateway of all mysteries, one must encounter the perfected. **Chapter Two: \"When All Under Heaven Know\"**\n\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.\nThus being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short shape each other,\nHigh and low incline toward each other,\nTones and voices harmonize with each other,\nFront and back follow each other.\n\nTherefore the sage abides in non-action,\nPractices the teaching without words,\nAllows the myriad things to arise without initiating,\nGives life without possessing,\nActs without relying,\nCompletes without dwelling.\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart.\n\nThe *Scripture* states: \"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, this is ugliness. When all know goodness as goodness, this is not-goodness. Thus beauty and ugliness oppose each other, being and non-being give rise to each other, difficulty and ease complete each other, long and short shape each other, high and low incline toward each other, tone and voice harmonize with each other, front and back follow each other. Therefore the sage abides in non-action, practices the teaching without words, allows the myriad things to arise without claiming, for they give life without possessing, act without relying, complete without dwelling. By not dwelling, all under heaven cannot remove their beauty.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"Without the myriad things, one does not know there are humans; without humans, one does not know there are heaven and earth; without heaven and earth, one does not know there is the Dao—how could one know the constant? As the constant Dao, who could deem it ugly? Yet when the myriad things arise together, beauty and ugliness take shape within them. Thus in the affairs of all under heaven, without ugliness one does not know beauty; without not-goodness one does not know goodness. Once beauty is known as beauty and goodness as goodness, then ugliness and not-goodness are distinguished within them—hence the Dao of mutual arising, mutual completing, mutual shaping, and mutual inclining abides therein. Therefore the sage abides in non-action and the people transform themselves, practices the teaching without words and the people trust themselves. Though the myriad things arise, they do not claim, for heaven and earth give life of themselves without possessing me, act of themselves without relying on me, complete of themselves without dwelling in me. By upholding this non-dwelling, the beauty of the sage cannot be removed.\"\n\nThe *Virtue* states: \"Yin and yang, movement and stillness, serve as each other’s foundation; hardness and softness, substance and function, form each other—all are the supreme beauty of all under heaven. To know the Dao in beauty is constancy; to know beauty as beauty is desire. To take desire as the Dao—this is ugliness. When Qian and Kun intermingle, Kan and Li are born; when Kan and Li intermingle, heaven and earth are restored. When all under heaven know intermingling as the Dao, is this not perfect goodness and perfect beauty? When all take intermingling as desire, how can this not be called ugliness? Thus being and non-being give rise to each other, as the sun and moon shine together; difficulty and ease complete each other, as water and fire restrain each other; long and short shape each other, as the crescent and full moon differ; high and low incline toward each other, as yin and yang press upon each other.\"",

      "translated_text": "Sounds harmonize with each other, as yang leads and yin responds; front and rear follow one another, as the two, three, six, and nine. Thus though the sage may wish to act, what is there to act upon? Though he may wish to teach, what is there to say? The myriad things arise together—what is there to reject? Therefore he gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, accomplishes yet does not dwell. Thus the sage can perfect the beauty of all under heaven, and so his days do not pass away.\n\nIf there is an \"I,\" he inevitably loses the Dao of spontaneity and falls into excess—how can this not be called ugliness?\n\n**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Worthy**\nNot exalting the worthy makes the people not contend; not prizing rare goods makes the people not steal; not displaying what is desirable keeps the people’s hearts from disorder. Therefore in the sage’s governance, he empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones. He constantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire, so that those with knowledge dare not act. Acting through non-action, there is nothing that is not well-ordered.\n\nThe *Classic* says: If one does not exalt the worthy, what use is contention among the people? If one does not prize rare goods, what use is theft among the people? If one does not display what is desirable, the people naturally do not fall into disorder. Thus in the sage’s governance, he constantly empties the mind through the Dao, fills the belly with the myriad things, weakens ambition through non-action, and strengthens the bones through non-doing. Naturally, the people are without knowledge and without desire, and even if there are those with knowledge, they dare not act. Acting through non-action, all under heaven is without disorder.\n\nThe *Dao* says: The ease of what precedes design—governing through non-action—rising, they breathe gently; resting, they sigh softly. Eating raw flesh and drinking blood, the people and things transform themselves. Ever since *Daxu* exalted the worthy, there has been *Yi*’s self-indulgence; ever since *Shihe* amassed goods, there have been *Yu*’s violent bandits. Thus not displaying what is desirable keeps the people’s hearts from disorder.\n\nTherefore in the sage’s governance, he takes the heart of all under heaven as his heart, ever receiving others with emptiness; he takes the belly of all under heaven as his belly, ever renewing virtue with fullness. Valuing the lowly and the noble alike, he greatly wins the people—thus he weakens their ambitions. The great person has achievements, ever strengthening himself without ceasing—thus he strengthens their bones. He constantly keeps the people without means to know, without means to desire, so that even if one or two with knowledge exist, they dare not act. For when the sage acts through non-action, all under heaven is without disorder.\n\nThe *Virtue* says: Within the body, worthy conduct is naturally not exalted—who would contend? Within the body, goods are naturally not prized—who would steal? Without contention, without theft, without displaying what is desirable, the people naturally do not fall into disorder. But if one makes them know, they contend over worthiness without exalting the worthy, steal goods without prizing them, and follow their hearts’ desires without restraint. When worthiness is destroyed and goods are exhausted, how can this last long?\n\nThus in the sage’s governance, he empties the mind with true constancy and utmost stillness, fills the belly with heaven and earth and sun and moon, weakens ambition with southern water and northern fire, and strengthens the bones with eastern metal and western wood. The people naturally have no knowledge, naturally have no desire, so that those with knowledge dare not act for their entire lives. For acting through action, there is nothing that is not disordered; acting through non-action, there is nothing that is not well-ordered.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Profundity**\nThe Dao is profound and used, yet it is never full. Abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. It blunts their sharpness, unties their tangles, harmonizes their radiance, and mingles with their dust. Deep and clear, it seems to endure. I do not know whose child it is—it seems prior to the Lord of Heaven.\n\nThe *Classic* says: Using the Dao’s profundity, it is never full. Vast and abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. It blunts the sharpness of their qi, unties the tangles of things, harmonizes their brilliance, and mingles with their dust. Clear and still, the Dao seems to endure. Those who attain this Dao—I do not know whose child they are—it seems the Lord of Heaven emerges prior to *Zhen*.\n\nThe *Dao* says: Pure qi rises to become heaven, turbid qi descends to become earth, and the harmonizing qi in the center becomes humans. Heaven and earth serve as the Dao’s function, yet they are never full; humans serve as the function of heaven and earth, yet they are never filled. When filled, they nearly come to rest.\n\nThus the sage, equal in sageliness and vast in depth, seems the ancestor of the myriad things. Ever with the upright qi, he blunts its sharpness, unties its tangles, harmonizes its radiance, and mingles with its dust. Clear and still, the Dao constantly seems to endure. Is he not prior to the people of the *Fuxi* era? Since *Fuxi*, the Dao has been used to its utmost. The Great Ultimate’s single circle—when has it ever been full? Void and bright, clear and penetrating, it is the ancestor of the myriad things. Using the round to cut the square blunts its sharpness; dividing yin and yang unties its tangles; alternating softness and hardness harmonizes its radiance; the six positions completing their patterns mingle with its dust. Changing and moving without abiding, flowing through the six voids, the Dao is deep and clear, enduring within them. I do not know whose child it is—it seems the image of the Lord of Heaven emerging from *Zhen*.\n\nThe *Virtue* says: Profundity is emptiness within. Using the Dao, it is never full—if full, it would exceed expectations. Deep and abysmal, it is the ancestor of the myriad things. With emptiness within, there is something—what else could it be but the ancestor? Though it blunts their sharpness, from where does it blunt them? Though it unties their tangles, from where does it untie them? Though it harmonizes their radiance, from where does it harmonize them? Though it mingles with their dust, from where does it mingle with them? Clear and still, each has the Dao enduring within—this single profound thing, I do not know whose child it will be. Those who become its child, within a single time period, seem prior to the Lord of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent—they regard the myriad things as straw dogs; the sage is not benevolent—he regards the hundred clans as straw dogs. Is not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows? Empty yet not collapsing, moving and ever producing. Much speech leads to exhaustion—it is better to guard the center.",

      "translated_text": "The Scripture states: Heaven and earth are not seven—how then do they regard the myriad things as straw dogs? They jointly uphold the Dao. The sage is not benevolent—how then does he regard the hundred clans as straw dogs? They jointly uphold heaven and earth. Are not the myriad things and the hundred clans like straw dogs? The Dao’s emptiness, the space between heaven and earth—is it not like a bellows? The qi’s emptiness: though void, it does not collapse; the more it moves, the more it produces. Better to guard emptiness. Much speech leads to exhaustion—better to guard the center.\n\nThe Dao says: Laying out white thatch—this is the utmost caution. That straw, though slight, may bear great weight. Exercise such caution in all arts, and you shall never err. Heaven and earth bestow no grace, yet great grace arises; thunder and fierce winds stir all things without exception. Heaven and earth are not benevolent, yet they are benevolent. The sage tempers severity with lenience, lenience with severity; severity and lenience balance each other, and governance is harmonized. The sage is not benevolent. The sage’s relation to the hundred clans is as heaven and earth’s to the myriad things: if unused, they are set aside; if used, they are honored as in sacrifice—what could be weightier? Straw dogs are what heaven, earth, and the sage hold in highest regard. Though the myriad things differ, none may join heaven in serving the Dao; though the hundred clans differ, none may join the sage in serving heaven. Only the straw dog may join heaven, earth, and the sage in this service. Do heaven, earth, and the sage not show benevolence to the myriad things and the hundred clans? Yet the myriad things and the hundred clans use them daily without knowing they are heaven and earth’s, the sage’s straw dogs—is their benevolence not profound?\n\nBetween heaven and earth, Kun is the bellows-sack, Qian the pipe and key. Thus, closing the door is Kun, opening it is Qian; one closing and one opening is called change, ceaseless coming and going is called passage. Hence, “empty yet not collapsing, moving and ever producing.” Therefore, the sage guards the center; his words do not reach exhaustion. When exhaustion comes, change follows; change brings passage, passage brings endurance. This does not depart from the sage’s center—hence, “it is better to guard the center.”\n\nVirtue says: Do heaven and earth ever fail to be benevolent? Things live by their own life, die by their own death. Does the sage ever fail to be benevolent? People live out their years or die young by their own fate. Life and death, long years and early demise—creatures and people bring these upon themselves. How could heaven, earth, and the sage be other than benevolent? To harm heaven and earth is the sage’s benevolence. If one knows that creatures and people are straw dogs, and heaven and earth are bellows, then one may forge the furnace to encircle heaven, wield hammer and tongs at the Supreme Ultimate, draw forth and replenish the sun and moon, set the stars in motion, transmute iron into gold, transcend the ordinary to enter sagehood, so that heaven cannot fulfill its numbers, the sage cannot claim his people. Though called not benevolent, where could benevolence be applied? Thus, “empty yet not collapsing, moving and ever producing.” No need for much speech—much speech leads to exhaustion. Better to guard the center, to regard heaven and self as one, past and present as one, the myriad things and self as one.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**\nThe valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Subtly, it seems to endure; its use is inexhaustible.\n\nThe Scripture states: An empty valley carries sound—its spirit does not die. This spirit is called the Mysterious Female. Heaven is the Mysterious, earth is the Female; Qian and Kun are the gates of change. The gate of Qian and Kun is called the root of heaven and earth. Subtly, it forms nature; enduring, it is ever in use, not through striving. The Dao says: In *Ascending*, the nine in the third place ascends to an empty city—heaven and earth are like a valley. Above and below are empty, yet its spirit does not die. Growth, harvest, storage, and the arising of the myriad things—this is called the Mysterious Female. In the top six, darkly ascending to its proper correlate, it is beneficial to persevere in unceasing integrity—this is the gate of the Mysterious Female. Returning to the first yang in the Kan trigram, wood grows within earth—this is called the root of heaven and earth. Thus, “subtly, it seems to endure; its use is inexhaustible.” The double-yang flower, if not distant, must die.\n\nVirtue says: The chamber of the valley spirit dwells in the Northern Sea, presiding over the watery abode. It has a name but no form, its transformations are unfathomable. Above, it joins the Mysterious of heaven; below, it unites with the Female of earth. The Mysterious and Female merge in the valley—its spirit does not die. “The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.” Thus, “the gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.” “The hidden dragon does not act”—subtly, it seems to endure. If used, it startles for a hundred leagues—hence, “its use is inexhaustible.” Master Ziyang said: To keep the valley spirit ever undying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root. When true essence returns to the golden chamber, a single bright pearl will never depart. He also said: The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known; most mistakenly apply it to mouth and nose. Though you may practice breath control for a thousand years, how can you seize the golden crow and the jade hare? Only those who truly know the Mysterious Female understand.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Endure**\nHeaven and earth endure. The reason heaven and earth can be long and enduring is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can long endure. Therefore, the sage places himself last and finds himself first, sets himself outside and finds himself preserved. Is it not because he is without self-interest? Thus he can fulfill his self-interest.\n\nThe Scripture states: Heaven and earth endure—the Dao is ever without action. The reason heaven can be long and earth can endure is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can long endure. Therefore, the sage places himself last and finds himself first, sets himself outside and finds himself preserved. Lasting in being last, lasting in being outside—is it not because he is without self-interest? Finding himself first, finding himself preserved—thus he can fulfill his self-interest. The Dao says: Thus, the *Book of Changes* has the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams determine good and ill fortune; good and ill fortune give rise to great undertakings. The reason heaven can be long and enduring is that it does not live for itself—thus it can long endure. Therefore, the sage places himself last and finds himself first; his Dao thus enables him to be first.",

      "translated_text": "Setting himself outside yet preserving himself—his Dao thus enables him to preserve himself. Is it not because he is without self-interest? His self is first preserved by the Dao, thus he can fulfill his self-interest.\n\nVirtue says: Heaven and earth can be long and enduring because they do not live for themselves. The sage can be long and enduring because he does not live for himself. If heaven and earth lived for themselves, they would not endure long before perishing. If the sage lived for himself, he would not endure long before failing. Therefore, the sage first nurtures others’ selves and thus can possess his own self; he first preserves others’ selves and thus can set his own self outside. Is this not because he is without self-interest? Putting others first and himself last, he thus fulfills his self-interest.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Highest Virtue Resembles Water**\nThe highest virtue resembles water. Water benefits the myriad things without contention, dwelling in places all others shun—thus it nearly approaches the Dao.\nDwelling in good earth, the mind in profound depth,\nGiving with goodwill, speaking with good faith,\nGoverning with good order, handling affairs with good skill,\nMoving with good timing.\nOnly by not contending does one remain free from blame.\n\nThe Classic says: The highest virtue resembles water. Water benefits the myriad things without contention, flowing to the lowest places, dwelling where all others shun—thus it nearly approaches the Dao.\nIn dwelling, it is good at earth;\nIn the mind, it is good at depth;\nIn giving, it is good at humaneness;\nIn speech, it is good at sincerity;\nIn governance, it is good at order;\nIn affairs, it is good at skill;\nIn movement, it is good at timing.\nThrough this non-contention, it remains free from fault.\n\nThe Dao says: Heaven is one, earth is six; Qian and Kan form water. Qian knows the great beginning; Kan presides over labor and movement—thus it is called the highest virtue. Qian, as the beginning, can bestow great benefit upon all under heaven without speaking of what it bestows—how then could it contend? Kan as water is the place where the myriad things return and are stored, dwelling where all others shun—thus it nearly approaches the Dao.\nDwelling in good earth: the perilous heights of heaven cannot be scaled; the perilous earth comprises mountains, rivers, hills, and mounds.\nThe mind in profound depth: water flows yet does not overflow.\nGiving with goodwill: conduct is esteemed, and going forth brings merit.\nSpeaking with good faith: traversing peril without losing trust.\nGoverning with good order: only with a penetrating mind can one be firm yet centered.\nHandling affairs with good skill: kings and lords set perils to guard their states.\nMoving with good timing: the timely use of peril—how great it is!\nOnly by not contending—laboring through Kan—though laboring, who can find fault with it? Thus it remains free from blame.\n\nVirtue says: As Master Ziyang said of the *White Tiger’s First Classic* and the divine water of the Treasure Flower Pool’s true gold, one then understands that the source of the highest virtue’s benefit runs deep—unlike ordinary medicinal substances. Why, though dwelling where all others shun, does it nearly approach the Dao? Within Kan lies return, the return to the root and restoration of life.\nDwelling in good earth: first, one must obtain the proper place.\nThe mind in profound depth: first, one must practice non-action.\nGiving with goodwill: first, one must choose companions wisely.\nSpeaking with good faith: one dare not lose the proper time.\nGoverning with good order: enriching the state and pacifying the people.\nHandling affairs with good skill: strengthening the army and securing victory.\nMoving with good timing: morning in *tun*, evening in *meng*.\nDare not contend for profit to gain strength.\nContention brings fault; only by not contending does one remain free from blame.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding to Fullness**\nHolding to fullness is not as good as stopping in time.\nSharpening to a point cannot be long preserved.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.\nWealth and nobility with arrogance bring one’s own downfall.\nTo withdraw when the work is done, the name achieved, and the self preserved—this is the Dao of heaven.\n\nThe Classic says: Holding to fullness—when gold and jade fill the hall—is not as good as stopping in time; none can guard them. Sharpening to a point—wealth and nobility with arrogance—cannot be long preserved; they bring one’s own downfall. To withdraw when the work is done, the name achieved, and the self preserved—this is the Dao of heaven.\n\nThe Dao says: The Dao of heaven diminishes the full and augments the humble; the Dao of earth transforms the full and flows to the humble; ghosts and spirits harm the full and bless the humble; the human Dao detests the full and favors the humble. Thus Kan does not fill—only when the banks are level is there no fault. When full, the Dao of Kan is lost—thus it is not as good as stopping in time. Affairs with pointed edges are not perfectly formed; sharpening to a point will surely blunt its edge—thus it cannot be long preserved. When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them; holding to fullness—wealth and nobility with arrogance—brings one’s own downfall, for it is sharpening to a point. Thus, to withdraw when the work is done, the name achieved, and the self preserved—this is the Dao of heaven.\n\nVirtue says: Essence and qi become things; wandering souls bring change. Thus one knows the conditions of ghosts and spirits—the Dao of holding to fullness while nurturing the po. Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen: the moon is full at *jia*; sun and moon face each other—this is the time for holding and guarding. Exceed it, and it wanes. Thus the sun, when full, declines; the moon, when full, is eclipsed. Heaven and earth wax and wane with time’s ebb and flow. Those who seize the workings of creation do not act thus: when the moon is full, when gold and jade fill the hall, why hold to fullness and guard achievement? To retreat and hide in secrecy is sufficient. This is the Dao of heaven. To advance further is like the dragon soaring too high—regret follows, for it has sharpened its point. Thus, to dwell in high position without arrogance: if one dwells above and is arrogant, who is to blame for the downfall?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Nurturing the Po**\nCan you nurture the po and embrace the One without separation?\nCan you concentrate qi to attain softness, like a newborn babe?\nCan you cleanse and purify your profound mirror, leaving no blemish?\nCan you love the people and govern the state without action?\nCan you open and close the gates of heaven without acting as the female?\nCan you comprehend the four directions without knowledge?\nGive life and nourish,\nGive life yet do not possess,\nAct yet do not rely,\nLead yet do not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\nThe Classic says: The sun nurtures, the moon embodies the po—can you embrace the One without separation? Yang qi attains softness—can you be like a newborn babe? Cleanse and purify the profound mirror—can you leave no blemish? Love the people and govern the state—can you do so without action? Open and close the gates of heaven—can you do so without acting as the female? Comprehend the four directions—can you do so without knowledge?",

The Two Modes generate the Four Images, the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams determine good and ill fortune; good and ill fortune give rise to great undertakings. The reason heaven can be long and enduring is that it does not live for itself—thus it can long endure. Therefore, the sage places himself last and finds himself first; his Dao thus enables him to be first.",

Sage does not act for the eyes but for the belly—\nHe discards their false allure, takes the belly’s true use.\n\nVirtue says:\nOf the five colors, only yellow is true to observe—\nBlack and red are false, blinding the eyes.\nOf the five tones, only *gōng* is true to hear—\n*shāng* and *jué* are false, deafening the ears.\nOf the five flavors, only sweetness is true to eat—\nSour and bitter are false, dulling the palate.\nTo gallop in hunts between birds and hares, without measure,\nIs folly that drives the heart to madness.\nTo covet the *lízóng* pearl as rare treasure,\nYet fail to obtain it—reduced to dust—\nWhat harm beyond obstructed conduct?\n\nThin wine surpasses tea,\nCoarse cloth surpasses nakedness,\nAn ugly wife surpasses an empty bed—\nThis is true nourishment of the belly, not the eyes.\nThus, discard the former, take the latter.\n\n---\n\n**The Chapter of Honor and Humiliation, the Fourteenth**\n\nHonor and humiliation are like a shock,\nGreat calamity is like the body itself.\n\nWhat is meant by honor and humiliation?\nHonor is lowly—\nTo gain it is a shock,\nTo lose it is a shock—\nThis is called honor and humiliation like a shock.\n\nWhat is meant by valuing great calamity as the body?\nMy great calamity arises from having a body—\nWhen I have no body, what calamity remains?\nThus, to hold the body as the world’s treasure,\nOne may entrust it to the world;\nTo love the body as the world’s treasure,\nOne may commit it to the world.\n\nThe Classic says:\nHonor and humiliation are like a shock,\nGreat calamity is like the body itself.\nHonor is lowly—\nTo gain honor is a shock,\nTo lose humiliation is also a shock—\nThis is called honor and humiliation like a shock.\nGreat honor lies in the body,\nGreat calamity lies in the body—\nIf one has no calamity, it is as if one has no body.\nIf one holds the body as the world’s treasure,\nOne may entrust it to the world;\nIf one loves the body as the world’s treasure,\nOne may commit it to the world—\nThis is called having no body.\n\nThe Way says:\nThe *jiǔwǔ* flying dragon ascends to Heaven,\nFavorable to seeing the great person—\nLike voices resonating, like *qi* seeking its kind,\nWater flows to moisture, fire seeks dryness,\nClouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger.\nThe Sage acts, and all things behold—\nThis is receiving Heaven’s honor.\nTo align with Heaven and Earth in virtue,\nTo align with the sun and moon in luminosity—\nTo gain this is a shock.\nThe *shàngjiǔ* soaring dragon regrets—\nHonored yet without position,\nElevated yet without people,\nThe worthy in low station with no aid—\nThus, action brings regret.\nMovement generates one *yīn* below, forming *xiù*—\nRegret and blame are symbols of worry and anxiety—\nThus, loss is a shock.\nIf the *jiǔwǔ* does not possess its body as the world’s honor,\nIt must long dwell in *jiǔwǔ*, never reaching *shàngjiǔ*’s great calamity—\nThis is called honor and humiliation like a shock.\nThus, he who holds the body as the world’s treasure\nMay entrust it to the world;\nHe who loves the body as the world’s treasure\nMay commit it to the world.\nThus, without possessing the body, there is no calamity—\nThis is clear.\n\nVirtue says:\nKnow the male, guard the female—\nTo gain this is a shock.\nTo confront the enemy lightly in battle—\nNo greater humiliation exists.\nTo gain and not lose is great honor in the body;\nTo lose and not gain is great calamity in the body.\nWith action, there is a body—\nNecessarily, great calamity follows;\nWithout action, there is no body—\nNecessarily, great honor follows.\nWhen the people are both rich and numerous,\nOne’s own body may be treasured and loved—\nTo benefit the people as they benefit themselves is to treasure the body;\nTo use the people as they use themselves is to love the body.\nThus, the Sage does not dare to hold the body as the world’s treasure,\nYet may entrust it to the world;\nDoes not dare to love the body as the world’s treasure,\nYet may commit it to the world.\nThis is called the noble love of having no body.\n\n---\n\n**The Chapter of the Unseen, the Fifteenth**\n\nWhat is unseen when viewed is called *yí*,\nWhat is unheard when listened to is called *xī*,\nWhat is ungrasped when seized is called *wēi*.\nThese three cannot be forced or questioned—\nThus, they merge into one.\nAbove, it is not bright,\nBelow, it is not dark.\nFaint and indistinct, beyond naming—\nReturning to nothingness.\nThis is called the form of no form,\nThe image of no image—\nThis is called *hūhuǎng*.\nApproach it, and you see no head;\nFollow it, and you see no tail.\nHold the ancient Way to govern the present.\nTo know the ancient beginning is called the *jì* of the Way.\n\nThe Classic says:\nWhat is unseen is not blindness,\nWhat is unheard is not deafness,\nWhat is ungrasped is not slowness.\nThe three—*yí*, *xī*, *wēi*—\nMerge into one, the existence of non-existence—\nThus, they cannot be reached by speech or question.\nAbove, it is not bright,\nBelow, it is not dark—\nPiercing emptiness, round and luminous,\nInternally and externally clear—\nFaint and indistinct, beyond naming,\nYet returning to nothingness—\nThis is called the form of no form,\nThe image of no image—\nThis is called *hūhuǎng*.",

to be the host, but only the guest.\nVast as ice about to thaw—\nThis is recognizing the heart and seeing the nature.\nSolid as uncarved wood—\nThis is the completion of the *jiǎgēng* (甲庚) cycle.\nExpansive as a valley—\nThis is the opening of the *wùjǐ* (戊己) gate.\nPure as turbid water settling—\nThis is the birth of *qiān cǎi* (铅采) and *guǐ shēng* (癸生).\n\nWho can settle the turbid through stillness?\nThis is the Way of the highest goodness, like water.\nWho can endure the settled to gradually give rise to life?\nThis is the ten-month gestation of the embryo.\n\nThose who

      "translated_text": "Thus, the Sage removes excess, removes extravagance, removes arrogance—is this not because they have no selfishness? Therefore, they can fulfill their own ends.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao**\nThose who assist the sovereign with the Dao do not use force of arms to compel the world; their actions return to them as they sow. Where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow. After great armies march, there will surely be years of famine. Thus, the virtuous are resolute in the Dao alone, daring not to rely on force. Resolute yet unboastful, resolute yet unvaunting, resolute yet unarrogant, resolute yet without compulsion—this is to be resolute without relying on force. When things flourish, they grow old; this is called *not-Dao*. *Not-Dao* brings early ruin#1.\n\nThe Classic says: Those who assist the sovereign with the Dao do not use force of arms to take the world; their actions return to them as they sow. Where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow. After great armies march, there will surely be years of famine. Thus, those skilled in assisting the sovereign are resolute in the Dao alone, daring not to rely on force. Resolute yet unvaunting, resolute yet unarrogant, resolute yet without compulsion—this is to be resolute without relying on force. Things flourish then grow old; this is called *not-Dao*. If one knows it is *not-Dao*, it is better to cease early.\n\nThe Dao says: Ministers and nobles assist the sovereign with the Dao, not using force of arms to compel the world. The sovereign assists Heaven and Earth with the Dao, not using violent governance to harm beings. The *Tai* hexagram speaks: \"Heaven and Earth unite—*Tai*. The sovereign completes Heaven and Earth’s Dao, aids their natural order, and governs the people accordingly. Thus, those who hold the Dao gain much assistance; those who lose the Dao gain little. When assistance is at its peak, the world follows them; when it is at its lowest, even kin betray them. To attack where the world follows and where kin betray—thus, the virtuous may have no war, yet if they war, they must win, not relying on force.\n\nIf one relies on force of arms to compel the world, their actions will surely return to them as they sow. Where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow. After great armies march, there will surely be years of famine. The Dao of Heaven returns as it sows. When the two *yang* lines are ascendant, reaching the eighth month, disaster is certain. Thus, those skilled in war are resolute in the Dao alone, daring not to rely on force of arms, for relying on force leads to defeat. If one attains resoluteness yet remains unboastful, unvaunting, unarrogant, and without compulsion—this is to be resolute without relying on force. Why? For things flourish then grow old; this is called *not-Dao*. If one knows it is *not-Dao*, it is better to cease early.\n\nThe *De* says: The sovereign is the heart. Those who govern the heart with the Dao hold tranquility and simplicity as supreme, daring not to use the weapons of victory to seize the world. The Great Yang flows with its flavor, longing to depart from humanity, so Heaven unleashes its killing intent, and dragons and serpents rise from the earth. When humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth reverse their course, and their actions will surely return to them as they sow. Heaven shakes, Earth trembles, mountains collapse, valleys split, trees fall, forests crumble, rivers dry, seas exhaust—is this not where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow, and after great armies march, there will surely be years of famine? Truly terrifying! Thus, those skilled in war are resolute in the Dao alone. If one attains the Dao and does not cease, why would they dare to rely on force? Thus, they do not boast, do not vaunt, do not grow arrogant, yet endure as if compelled—this is to be resolute without relying on force. For when strength is used in humility, strength is preserved; if strength is used recklessly, it will meet ruin. It is said: things flourish yet do not cease, they grow old—this is called *not-Dao*. Knowing it is *not-Dao*, cease early.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: The Fine Weapon**\nThe fine weapon is an ominous instrument; beings detest it, so those who hold the Dao do not dwell upon it. Thus, the virtuous in peace value the left, in war value the right. The weapon is an ominous instrument, not the instrument of the virtuous; it is used only when unavoidable, with tranquility and simplicity held supreme. To win yet not take pride in victory—if one takes pride, they delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world. Thus, auspicious matters are honored on the left, inauspicious on the right. The Assistant General stands left, not mastering killing; the Supreme General stands right, signifying a position of dominance, treated with funeral rites. Many are slain, and with sorrowful weeping—thus, even in victory, they are treated with funeral rites.\n\nThe Classic says: To call arms a fine weapon is to speak of an ominous instrument; beings detest it, so those who hold the Dao do not dwell upon it. Thus, the virtuous in peace value the left—life’s side—and in war value the right#2—death’s side. The weapon is an ominous instrument, not the instrument of the virtuous; it is used only when unavoidable, with tranquility and simplicity held supreme. Thus, to win yet not regard it as beautiful—if one regards it as beautiful, they will delight in it, and delighting in it is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing, others will surely kill them; they cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world. Thus, auspicious matters are honored on the left, inauspicious on the right. The Assistant General stands left, not mastering killing. The Supreme General stands right, signifying a position of dominance, treated with funeral rites. Many are slain, and with sorrowful weeping—thus, even in victory, they are treated with funeral rites.\n\nThe Dao says: The army is the multitude. *Zhen* is rectitude. To govern the multitude with rectitude is to attain kingship. When firm yet yielding, moving through peril yet following the natural order—with this, one poisons the world, yet the people follow, bringing auspice. If the people do not follow, what disaster is there? Thus, even the fine weapon is an ominous instrument, much less relying on force! Beings detest it, so those who hold the Dao do not dwell upon it. Thus, the virtuous in peace value the left, for the Emperor emerges from *Zhen*—spring’s birth with benevolence—so auspicious matters are honored on the left. Thus, the Assistant General stands left, the fourth line of the *Shi* hexagram placing the army on the left, treated with auspicious rites. In war, the right is valued, for the *Wang* hexagram is linked to *Yi*—autumn’s killing with righteousness—so inauspicious matters are honored on the right.",

War is an ominous instrument, not the tool of the virtuous. When used unavoidably, one must hold to serenity, simplicity, and emptiness as supreme—thus, it is not glorified. If war is taken as a noble pursuit, it will surely become like Qin and Chu, delighting in slaughter.

Only after war’s end may one behold the Sage.\"* This is the finest of war’s instruments, yet still an ominous tool, which beings may detest.

In war, they stand on the right, knowing to embrace the dark while guarding the bright—seeking the essence of metal. Taking must follow the Way; one does not seize by force. War is an ominous instrument, not the tool of the virtuous. If used unavoidably, serenity is supreme. Thus, war is not glorified; to glorify it is to wield a tool of slaughter.

*subtle clarity*.\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\n\nFish cannot escape the depths,\nNor can a state’s sharpest tools\nBe shown to all.\n\nThe Classic says:\nTo stretch is to contract,\nTo strengthen is to weaken,\nTo exalt is to discard,\nTo take is to give.\n\nIf one would thus attain,\nOne must thus lose—\nThis is called *subtle yet clear*.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nIf fish are rigid and strong,\nThey cannot escape the yielding depths.\n\nThus, a state’s sharpest tools\nMust not be displayed to all.\n\nThe Dao says:\nWithin, clarity and refinement,\nWithout, softness and compliance—\nTo endure great peril,\nAs did King Wen.\n\n*Difficult virtue stands firm*—\nHiding its brilliance.\n\nWithin, turmoil yet steadfast resolve—\nAs did Ji Zi.\n\nThus, the moon, veiled, shines brighter,\nThe dawn, obscured, arrives clearer,\nThe sky, not cold, brings summer’s heat,\nThe earth, concealed, nurtures life—\nThe sovereign power of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAs for eastward labor and westward harvest,\nA hundredfold gain for the people—\nThe people’s sovereign power.\n\nWith some, one may stand;\nWith others, one must yield—\nThe Sage treasures this deeply.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong—\nLike fish and dragons, they cannot escape the depths.\nThis is called *first subtle, then manifest*.\n\nThus, the depths of softness and weakness—\nThe treasures of river and sea—\nMust not be revealed lightly,\nFor revelation brings peril.\n\nStrengthening, exalting, giving, taking—\nThe state’s sharpest tools—\nMust not be displayed to all,\nFor display brings danger.\n\nIf schemes are not kept secret,\nDisaster will surely arise.\n\n*Virtue says*:\nKnow the male yet cling to the female—\nThis is the valley of all under Heaven.\nKnow the white yet cling to the black—\nThis is the model for all under Heaven.\n\nThe Dao is a thief—\nThree thefts are fitting.\n*Virtue* is attainment—\nOne attainment is the measure.\n\nIn essence, cultivation is human effort.\nThough called human effort,\nStillness rules the restless,\nYin and yang must align,\nFire and timing must be balanced.\n\nWhat is weak, discarded, taken away—\nIf held within,\nThen stillness awaits movement;\nWhat is strong, exalted, given—\nIf in others,\nThen movement follows stillness.\n\nThis is called *subtle yet manifest*.\n\nAll things arise from water and return to water.\nWater is supremely soft and weak—\nYet fish and dragons cannot escape the depths.\n\nHumans, at their most rigid and strong,\nCannot escape the *Heavenly One’s* water.\n\nThus, a state’s sharpest tools\nMust not be displayed to all—\nLightly shown, they bring ruin.\nA person’s greatest treasure\nMust not be displayed to all—\nLightly shown, they invite censure.\n\nThis is the sovereign power of Heaven, Earth, and the Sage—\nNot the rhetoric of *strategic maneuvering*.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao/Way of Constant Non-Action**\n\nThe Dao/Way constantly does nothing\nYet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nAll things would transform of themselves.\n\nWhen

stillness—\nStillness, and all under Heaven will align itself.\n\nThe Dao says:\nThe Dao/Way is originally non-action,\nIts root is non-desire.\nNon-action and non-desire—\nYet nothing remains undone or undesired.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nAll things would transform of themselves.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun\nWore simple robes,\nYet all under Heaven was governed—\nGoverned through non-action.\n\nWhat need for action?\nOnly reverence and rectitude in the southern face—\nThus it is said: *I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves.*\n\nWhen transformation stirs to act,\nAgain, lest they lean toward action,\nI will restrain it with the *Nameless Primordial*.\n\nThe Dao/Way is constant non-action—\nThe *Nameless Primordial* will also refuse to act.\nTo govern those who desire,\nOne must hold to stillness—\nStillness, and all under Heaven will align itself.\n\n*Virtue says*:\nThe Dao/Way is constant non-action—\nThe pure, still body—\nYet nothing remains undone.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold it with the Dao/Way,\nAll things would transform of themselves.\n\nWhen transformation stirs to act,\nI will restrain it with the *Nameless Primordial*—\nThe *Primordial Medicine of the Pre-Heaven*—\nThe *Primordial Primordial* is not what is desired.\n\nDesiring yet not desiring—\nOnly by holding to stillness\nWill the nature and life of all under Heaven

folly—\nHence he discards that and takes this.\n\nThe Dao/Way says:\nThe *Qian* (乾)—\nThe most robust of all under Heaven—\nIts virtue/power and conduct are ever simple, yet it knows danger.\nThe *Kun* (坤)—\nThe most yielding of all under Heaven—\nIts virtue/power and conduct are ever unadorned, yet it knows obstruction.\n\nThe *Upper Classic* (上经) speaks of the constant Dao/Way,\nThe constant

great virtue/power—\nThe highest and lowly respond to it—\nWhy must there be action?\nTo be reverent and occupy the southern seat is sufficient.\n\nThe age of Yao and Shun—\nThe highest righteousness

of Shang and Zhou—\nThe highest has the benevolence of Yao and Shun to respond to it.\nThe highest propriety acts yet righteousness does not respond—\nHow much less does it respond?\nThen it rolls up

possess virtue/power of his own—\nThis is called the highest virtue/power.\n\nThe lowly virtue/power holds to virtue/power without losing it—\nComparing it to nature—\nThis is called lacking

      "translated_text": "The **Dao** is singular in its essence—\nThus, the *Great Ultimate* is one circle of the Dao.\n\nTherefore, the *Yì* (易) speaks of the *Great Ultimate* (太极),\nWhich gives birth to the *Two Principles* (兩儀),\nThe *Two Principles* generate the *Four Symbols* (四象),\nThe *Four Symbols* produce the *Eight Trigrams* (八卦),\nThe *Eight Trigrams* determine auspicious and inauspicious,\nAnd auspicious and inauspicious give rise to great undertakings.\n\nHeaven, Earth, the *shen* (神), the *gǔ* (谷), all things, and the feudal lords—\nTheir governance is one.\nHeaven, without the One, would surely crack,\nEarth, without the One, would surely erupt,\nThe *shen*, without the One, would surely falter,\nThe *gǔ*, without the One, would surely run dry,\nAll things, without the One to sustain their birth, would surely perish,\nAnd the feudal lords, without the One to uphold their virtue and nobility, would surely decline.\n\nThus, the noble relies on the lowly as its root,\nAnd the high relies on the lowly as its foundation.\nThis is why the feudal lords designate themselves as *\"gū-guǎ-bùgǔ\"* (孤寡不谷),\nTaking the lowly as root—\nIs this not so?\nIs it not so?\n\nTherefore, to focus on the use of many carriages,\nYet count their forms—\nThis is to have no carriages at all.\n\nThe polished brilliance of jade,\nThe rough solidity of stone—\nThe sage does not desire such fixed forms,\nFor the body is but a spoken term.\n\nThus, the sage values its use,\nNot its form,\nResides in its substance,\nNot its surface.\n\n**Virtue** says: The One—\nNo thought, no action,\nThe divine and mysterious attainment of the One.\n\nTherefore, the division from the Dao is called *ming* (命),\nThe manifestation of the One is called *xìng* (性),\nThe transformation through yin and yang, symbolized and expressed, is called *shēng* (生),\nThe exhaustion of change and the completion of number is called *sǐ* (死).\n\n*Ming* is the primordial *qi* of Heaven,\nWithout which nothing exists.\n\nHumans have six yang converging at one head—\nThus, *Kàn* (乾) is the head,\nAnd Heaven attains the One with clarity.\n\nHumans have five viscera gathered in one abdomen—\nThus, *Kūn* (坤) is the abdomen,\nAnd Earth attains the One with settledness.\n\nThe heart is the sovereign of the *shen*—\nAll dharmas arise from it,\nAnd the *shen* attains the One with refinement.\n\nThe *gǔ*’s *shen* does not die—\nThis is called the *Mysterious Mother* (玄牝),\nAnd the *gǔ* attains the One with fullness.\n\nGold and sand enter the five viscera,\nDispersing like mist, like wind and rain,\nPerfuming and nourishing to the four limbs,\nEnhancing complexion and luster—\nAll things attain the One with birth.\n\nThen, when achievements are complete and names are fulfilled,\nThe feudal lord aligns with Heaven and Earth in **virtue**,\nWith the sun and moon in luminosity,\nWith the four seasons in order,\nAnd with the spirits and *shen* in auspicious and inauspicious—\nThis is how the feudal lord attains the One as the steadfast foundation of all under Heaven.\n\nThus, Heaven, without fear of cracking, endures clarity,\nEarth, without fear of eruption, endures settledness,\nThe *shen*, without fear of exhaustion, endures refinement,\nThe *gǔ*, without fear of depletion, endures fullness,\nAll things, without fear of annihilation, endure birth,\nAnd the feudal lords, without fear of decline, endure virtue—\nTheir attainment of the One is the same.\n\nAt first, the most humble things are taken as root,\nAnd the sage is called noble.\nAt first, the most base things are taken as foundation,\nAnd the high is aligned with Heaven.\nThus, the feudal lords designate themselves as *\"gū-guǎ-bùgǔ\"*—\nIs this not their way of taking the lowly as root?\nIs it not so?\nIs it not so?\n\nTherefore, to focus on carriages yet count their forms—\nThis is to have no carriages at all.\nTo focus on the Dao yet count its forms—\nThis is to have no Dao at all.\n\nThus, the sage does not desire\nThe polished brilliance of jade,\nThe rough solidity of stone—\nBut to conceal all uses.\n\nThe chapter of **Return** (反), the fourth movement of the Dao:\n**Return** is the Dao’s dynamic motion,\n**Weakness** is the Dao’s subtle use.\n\nAll things under Heaven are born from *yǒu* (有),\nAnd *yǒu* arises from *wú* (無).\n\nThe Classic says:\n**Return** and **Repetition** (復) are the Dao’s motion,\n**Gentleness** and **Weakness** (柔弱) are the Dao’s use.\n\nAll things under Heaven,\nFrom *wú* arise in *yǒu*,\nAnd from *yǒu* return to *wú*—\nThe origin and the end, returning in cycles.\n\nThe Dao says:\n**Repetition** (復), **Completion** (亨), **Firmness** (剛) returns.\nMotion with harmony brings forth,\nThus, entering and exiting without haste,\nFriends arriving without blame.\n\nTo return and repeat the Dao,\nIn seven days, it returns again.\nThe motion of Heaven—\nDoes it not reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth?\n\nWhen the One Yang returns,\nThe sun aligns with Heaven’s order,\nHeaven’s motion is primary—\n**Return** is the Dao’s dynamic motion.\n\nIt faces firmness yet remains gentle,\nAnd in the midst of firmness, it responds.\nGreat **Completion** with rectitude—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nUntil the eighth month, when there is inauspiciousness,\nAnd the decline is not long.\n\nWhen the Two Yangs reach **Facing** (臨),\nThe moon aligns with Earth’s order,\nEarth’s nature is still—\n**Weakness** is the Dao’s subtle use.\n\n**Small Completion** (泰) goes from small to great,\nAnd **Completion** (亨) brings auspiciousness—\nThis is when Heaven and Earth interact,\nAnd all things are in harmony.\nAbove and below interact,\nAnd their intentions are unified.\n\nWithin, the yang; without, the yin,\nWithin, vigor; without, compliance,\nWithin, the *junzi* (君子); without, the *xiǎorén* (小人)—\nThe *junzi*’s Dao endures,\nThe *xiǎorén*’s Dao declines.\n\nWhen the Three Yangs unite in **Small Completion**,\nThings align with human order,\nThe ruler is born—\nAll things under Heaven are born from *yǒu*.\n\nUntil the tenth month, when *Kūn* (坤) conceals it,\nAnd from *yǒu* arises *wú*—\nReturning to the origin and the end.\n\n**Virtue** says:\n**Shedding** (剥) is when One Yang is above,\n**Return** is when One Yang is below,\n**Decisive** (夬) is when One Yin is above,\n**Meeting** (姤) is when One Yin is below—\n*Kàn* and *Kūn* come and go,\nThe gate of **Closure** and **Opening** (阖辟).\n\n*Kǎn* (坎) is the moon’s water,\nAnd **Return** is the **Middle Male** (中男).\n*Lí* (離) is the sun’s fire,\nAnd **Return** is the **Middle Female** (中女).\n\nThe *Zǐyáng* (紫陽) says:\nThe sun dwells in the *Lí* position,\nYet **Return** makes it female;\n*Kǎn* is paired with the *Chán* (蟾) palace,\nAnd thus it is male—\nIf one does not grasp this inverted meaning,\nDo not presume to speak of the Dao’s profound truths.\n\nAgain it says:\nIf one seeks to reverse the use of the sun,\nThe very dust of the earth becomes treasure.\n\nThus, it is said: **Return** is the Dao’s dynamic motion.\n\n*Bì* (畢) becomes the crow,\n*Fáng* (房) becomes the rabbit—\n*Lí* and *Kǎn* mutually serve as their foundation.\n\nThe **Supreme Virtue** is like water,\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend—\nThus, it is said: **Weakness** is the Dao’s subtle use.\n\nAll things under Heaven arise from *wú* within *yǒu*,\nThus, it is said: *yǒu* arises from *wú*;\nAnd from *yǒu* arises *wú*—\nThus, it is said: *wú* arises from *yǒu*.\nThe interplay of *yǒu* and *wú*,\nThe interplay of difficulty and ease—\nAnd thus all things are **Completed** (既濟).\n\nThe chapter of the **Noble Ones Hearing the Dao** (上士聞道):\nThe **Noble One** hears the Dao,\nAnd diligently practices it;\nThe **Middle One** hears the Dao,\nAnd holds it with uncertain resolve;\nThe **Lowly One** hears the Dao,\nAnd laughs at it—\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nThere are words to establish this.",

**Softness** and **Weakness** as the **Master**.\n\nThe **Dao** says:\nThe **Dao** is the **Great Ultimate**’s single cycle,\nEntering and exiting, moving and still.\nThe **Dao** generates **One**—\n**Heaven** and **Earth**, the two **Polarities**, each receive **One** as **Odd** and **Even**.\n**One** generates **Two**—the **Four Symbols**.\n**Two** generates **Three**—the **Eight Trigrams**.\nThe **Three Lines** of the **Primordial Heaven**, these are the **true numbers** of the *Classic*.\n**Three** generates all things—\n**Hard** and **Soft** intermingle,\nThe **Eight

**Harmony** is achieved among all things to fulfill the **Three Talents**’ **Dao**,\nMaking man the **Master** of all things.\nWhat men detest\nAre only the **Orphan**, the **Widow**, the **Childless**—\nBecause they are **lowly** and **humble**, men despise them.\nYet **Kings** and **Dukes** take them as noble titles,\n**Humility** brings **honor**, and the **lowly** are **unassailable**.\nThus, what is diminished yet gains,\nIs **nobility** rooted in **humility**,\n**Elevation** founded on **lowliness**.\nWhat gains yet is diminished,\nIs like the sun at noon descending,\nThe moon at full waning.\nThe **Dao** that men are taught,\nIs also my righteous teaching—\nYet they cannot make what is diminished gain,\nOnly long make what gains diminish.\nThus, for learning, it is daily gain,\nFor the **Dao**, it is daily loss.\nTherefore, the **Soft** and **Weak** endure and thrive,\nDiminished yet gain,\nWhile the **Strong** and **Arrogant** perish,\nGained yet are diminished.\nHence I say, I shall take them as my teaching father,\nFor they **do not overstep the measure**.\n**Virtue** says:\nThe **Dao** originates from **Emptiness** and

**Truth**,\nEternal through ages, never decaying—\nMastering **One**, all matters conclude,\nThus **One** generates **Two**.\n**Two** is **Qi**—\n**Two** generates **Three**.\n**Three** is

**Fire**’s **Mastery** within man.\nIf man’s **Fire** **Mastery** is like the **Orphan**, the **Widow**, the **Childless**,\nIt is most detested by men—\nThus the **lowly scholar** hears the **Dao** and laughs greatly,\nWhile **Kings** and **Dukes** take it as a noble title—\nWhy is this?\n**Nobility** rooted in **humility**,\n**Elevation** founded on **lowliness**.\nThings in the world that are diminished yet gain,\nAre those that, when one seeks to **pluck** them,\nMust first be **stretched** taut.\nThings that gain yet are diminished,\nAre those that, before they are **taken**,\nFirst give themselves away.\nNow, the **Dao** that men are taught,\nIs also my righteous teaching—\nYet none can follow me in turning **inversion** into **rectitude**,\nOr **disorder** into **order**.\nAlas!\nThe **Strong** and **Arrogant** meet no good end,\nFor they take **rectitude** as **inversion**,\nAnd **order** as **disorder**.\nHence I say, I shall take them as my teaching

**ultimate Softness** of the world,\nGoes nowhere without **yielding**.\nIn terms of **Wind**, **Grass** is the **ultimate Firmness** of the world—\n**Wind** rides and roams in **Grass**, thus **Wind** upon **Grass** must **subside**.\n**Wind** is **Qi** with **sound**,\n**Qi** is **Wind** without **sound**.\n**Water** is **Qi** with **form**,\n**Grass** is **Wind** with **form**.\nThus it

says:\n**Tang and Wu** revolutionized, conforming to **Heaven** and responding to **humanity**,\nWhen the world was at great peace, horses were returned to the southern slopes of **Hua Mountain**,\nCattle were released into the **Peach Grove** wilds—\nWarhorses turned to plow.\n\nIn the **Spring and Autumn** era, the **Way** decayed,\nRites, music, and conquests issued from the

is **constant contentment**.\n\n**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**\nNot leaving the door, yet knowing all under heaven;\nNot peering through the window, yet seeing **Heaven’s Way**.\nThe farther one

see,\nAccomplishes without action.\n\nThe **Way** says:\nThe **Sage** exhausts **principle**, fulfills **nature**, reaching even **fate**—\nWhat ears and eyes cannot perceive, by **principle** it is deduced,\nThus, a thousand-year calendar may be achieved while seated.\nThe more the mind strays, the less it knows.\nMastering **Oneness**, all affairs are complete.\nThus, the **Sage** shuts the **Four Gates**, opens the **Four Eyes**, penetrates the **Four Hearings**,\nTaking all under heaven’s **knowing** as **knowing**, yet not acting,\nTaking all under heaven’s **name** as **name**, yet not revealing,\nTaking all under heaven’s **accomplishment** as **accomplishment**, yet not doing.\n\n**Virtue** says:\nSitting is **establishment**, standing is **extinction**—\nHow could one leave

their rulers consuming too much of their taxes.\nIf I do nothing, the people will transform themselves.\nIf I love stillness, the people will align themselves—\nlike water, which can bear a boat\nor overturn it.\nWhen laws are pushed to extremes, deceit arises;\nwhen orders are issued, trickery follows.\nThus, the people are hard to govern\nbecause their rulers act excessively.\nIf the ruler does nothing, the world will govern itself.\nThose who love excessively must spend excessively,\nand those who hoard excessively will lose excessively.\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace,\nknowing

doubt.\nWhen they near death, they become rigid and strong,\nso *Kǎn* and *Lǐ* govern them,\nand their hearts become hard,\ntheir branches withered and brittle.\nThus, it is said:\nRigidity and strength belong to death,\nwhile softness and weakness belong to life.\nTherefore, strong armies do not conquer,\nand strong trees are felled—\nas when a woodcutter fells a tree.\nThus, the strong and
