  "full_translation": "**Essential Secrets of the Supreme Pole Perfected One’s Nine-Cycle Returning Elixir**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Essential Secrets of the Supreme Pole Perfected One’s Nine-Cycle Returning Elixir*\n*Author unknown, roughly dated to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. One fascicle. Base text from the* Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, section \"Divine Spells,\" category \"Miscellaneous Arts.\"*\n\n---\n\nThe Lord of Western Citadel, Wang Jun, said: To compound the Nine-Cycle [Elixir], first craft the divine crucible, capable of holding three *dou* and a half. Use soil from Rongyang, Changsha, and Yuzhang, with the crucible walls four *fen* thick. Take left-valve oysters from the Eastern Sea, white halloysite, mica powder, earthworm excrement, talc, and white reputite—six substances in equal parts, each ground twenty thousand strokes. When finished, combine and grind them together another thirty thousand strokes, then sift through fine silk. Next, mix with hundred-day bitter wine to a clay-like consistency, and grind another ten thousand strokes. Coat the inner and outer surfaces of the earthen crucible with this paste to a thickness of three *fen*, then dry it in a dark chamber. On a mild sunny day, apply another three-*fen* layer, drying it for ten days as before. Repeat this three times, so the inner and outer coatings together measure one *cun* and three *fen*. Once the paste is dry, take red lead and mix it with bitter wine to form a paste, grinding it thirty thousand strokes. Coat the inner surfaces of both crucibles to a thickness of three *fen*, then dry in the shade for five days and nights. Add another two-*fen* layer, drying it again in the shade, ensuring no hairline cracks appear—if any do, the crucible is unusable. Seal the seams with a brush made of goat’s whiskers, ensuring all gaps are tightly closed. Thus is the divine crucible for the Nine-Cycle Returning Elixir completed.\n\nNext, select a secluded mountain site untouched by human footsteps, near flowing water to the east, and construct a divine furnace-chamber. The chamber should be four *zhang* long and two *zhang* wide, with its foundation raised four *chi*. First, dig three to five *chi* deep into the ground; only if the site is free of old wells, graves, or burial mounds may the foundation be laid and the chamber built. Install three doors: one facing south, one east, and one west. Then erect the furnace in the center of the chamber, its mouth facing west. Inside the furnace cavity, place an iron *nao*-bell large enough to hold the earthen crucible, with a nine-*cun* clearance on all sides. Construct the furnace with fine, well-tamped soil, ensuring no cracks form. Thus is the divine furnace completed.\n\n**Method for Preparing the Ingredients:**\n- Alum: 1 *jin*\n- Malachite: 3 *jin* (if azurite is available, use azurite instead)\n- White quartz: 2 *jin*\n- Cinnabar: 10 *jin* (must be lustrous and not stain paper; the finest from Chen or Jinzhou)\n- Realgar: 4 *jin* (pure, bright red, not staining paper)\n- Orpiment: 5 *jin*\n- Mercury: 6 *jin*\n\nOf the above, only mercury is not ground. The other six substances are each ground thirty thousand strokes. First, place the alum at the bottom of the crucible, then add malachite, white quartz, cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment in sequence, with orpiment alone on top, leveled evenly. Pour the six *jin* of mercury over the orpiment. Once all is in place, seal the crucible with its divine lid. First, use red lead paste to seal the joint between the lower crucible and its rim, then place the upper crucible on top, also sealing its rim to ensure the two crucibles fit tightly. Coat the outer joint with red lead paste to a thickness of one *cun* and two *fen*—this is the method for earthen crucibles. If using fired clay, ceramic, gold, silver, or bronze crucibles, adjust the thickness accordingly, as it need not be exactly one *cun* and two *fen*. The earthen crucible is coated three times; each layer must seal the joint between the two crucibles, allowed to dry before applying the next, until the thickness reaches one *cun* and two *fen*. Then coat the exterior with Six-One Paste to a thickness of one *cun* and two *fen*, following the same method as the red lead paste, drying it gradually. The total thickness will be two *cun* and four *fen*. Once complete, place the crucible on the iron *nao*-bell, which has four legs shaped like a mirror stand, each nine *cun* high.\n\nFirst, place a slow fire of chaff beneath the *nao*-bell, six *cun* from the crucible’s base, for nine days and nights. Then increase the fire to three *cun* from the base for another nine days and nights. Next, raise the fire to the level of the crucible’s base for nine days and nights. Then elevate it to three *cun* above the crucible’s belly for nine days and nights, and further to five *cun* above the belly (two *cun* higher) for another nine days and nights. Finally, raise the fire to one *cun* below the crucible’s joint for nine days and nights. Stop the fire and let it cool for ten days. Then increase the fire to half a *cun* below the joint, maintaining it for thirty-six days and nights. In total, the firing lasts ninety days and nights—this is called the Nine-Cycle Returning Elixir. After the full term, let it cool for seven days. Remove the crucible from the furnace, lift the upper crucible, and behold: the flying essence, resplendent in nine colors and radiant light, will have adhered to the inner surface of the upper crucible. Sweep it clean with a three-year-old rooster’s feather, store it in a sealed vessel, and carry it at your elbow. Each dose weighs two *liang*. At dawn, facing east, consume it with fresh, pure water. It will enable you to vanish and disperse your form, soaring through the Great Void. The Supreme Pole will dispatch envoys in feathered chariots of gold and cinnabar to welcome you. Your form will multiply into countless white cranes, ascending to the Supreme Subtlety, where you will become a Perfected Immortal, your lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries. You will reverse aging and restore youth, your face glowing with jade-like radiance, your neck adorned with luminous brilliance—all by the power of the Nine-Cycle Returning Elixir.\n\nTake ten *jin* of lead, place it in an iron vessel, and heat it fiercely until molten. Add one *zhū* of the Nine-Cycle Essence to the lead, stir, and in an instant, it will transform into nine *jin* of yellow gold. Take one *jin* of mercury and seven *jin* of tin, place them in a pot, and heat until boiling three times. Add one *zhū* of the Nine-Cycle Essence, and it will transmute accordingly.\n\nIn the tin melt, stir it, and in an instant, it will transform into white silver. Such transmutations signify the elixir’s completion. If testing proves unsuccessful, repeat the above method and refine it for another ninety days and nights—none will fail to succeed.\n\nTake the elixir dregs from the earthen crucible, pound them with five thousand strokes, blend them with white sandalwood honey, and form pills the size of parasol seeds, naming them the Supreme Ultimate Life-Restoring Divine Pills. For those who have died fewer than three days prior, pry open their mouths, insert two pills, and administer fresh water—they will revive at once. For wounds, mutilations, or deformities, blindness, or deafness, apply the divine pills as a salve, and all will be restored as before. For internal ailments, ingest two pills. For external afflictions, grind two pills into powder and apply it as a poultice—healing will be immediate. Whatever the malady, it will be cured by one’s own hand.\n\nTake one pill daily, and your lifespan will equal that of heaven and earth. When the divine pills are applied to objects, they will return to one’s hand of their own accord. As for the earthen crucible, take care not to destroy it, for it may be reused to compound the elixir. Simply reseal the upper and lower openings of the crucible more tightly, ensuring no impurity or negligence befalls it. When ready for use, plaster the interior and exterior with lead cinnabar mud, making it as thick as a finger’s width, following the previous method.\n\nIf the fire is weak and the allotted days have passed yet the elixir’s essence has not ascended, it is merely due to insufficient fire. Seal the crucible’s openings firmly once more and refine it for another thirty-six days—there will be no failure, and the ninety days and nights will no longer be necessary, for the process will be perfected.\n\nFirst, purify yourself for a hundred days, then prepare the divine crucible. Pound the ingredients to a fine consistency, and on the ninth day of the ninth month at dawn, kindle the fire. From the start of your purification, sever all worldly affairs and await the elixir’s completion.\n\nThose who compound the elixir should be of sincere heart, yearning for the Dao, pure and harmonious, loyal and trustworthy, free from excess, and steadfast in resolve—three such individuals will suffice. If such people are difficult to find, two will do. All must fast, bathe, and abstain from stepping over graves or encountering corpses, as well as from chickens and dogs—these are grave taboos.\n\nSome may ask why cultivation and refinement are so arduous—it is largely due to these very precautions. This Nine-Cycle Divine Elixir formula, transmitted as the oral instructions of Perfected Lord Wang, flows smoothly and is easy to compound. If the ingredients are of the finest quality, the purification rites meticulously observed, and the seclusion profound and tranquil, this formula’s divine efficacy will ensure success without fail.\n\nOn the day the purification begins, first offer five *hu* of clear wine to the flowing water at your dwelling. If the land lacks flowing water, use a fine well, pouring the wine into it to appease the earth’s *qi*. All who partake in the purification rites shall drink this water.\n\nWhen transmitting the divine scriptures and elixir instructions, one must swear a purification oath, using eight *liang* of golden fish and a jade dragon coiled in a ring as substitutes for the blood-oath of cutting hair. If such items are difficult to obtain in the world and one cannot permanently seal the numinous guardians, use forty *chi* of fine blue cloth as a pledge equivalent to the golden fish, and forty *chi* of heavy silk to match the jade dragon’s coiled ring. Together, present these to a master who possesses the scriptures, who shall distribute them to aid impoverished scholars in the mountains—one must not keep them for personal use, thereby demonstrating the celestial pact and showing impartiality. Those who violate the oath and leak the secrets will face the laws of the Four Poles. Guard this well and be cautious.\n\n**The Yellow Emperor’s Four-Fan Powder Formula**\nBefore refining and ingesting the Nine-Cycle Elixir, one should first take the following medicines to gradually dispel the impurities and ailments of the mundane world. By eliminating grains and purifying the five viscera and six bowels, one may attain perfection.\n\nPine resin, *ze xie* (water plantain), mulberry wood, dried ginger, mica, dried rehmannia, *shi shang pu* (stone-growing *Acorus*), and cinnamon—eight ingredients in total, refined in equal parts and pounded forty thousand times. Store them in a sealed vessel, ensuring no women, livestock, or impure things come into contact with them. Take three square *bi* each morning with wine, or water, or form honeyed pills the size of soybeans. Ingest twenty pills daily, increasing to thirty, and after half a season, the impurities will be purged, and all illnesses dispelled—then one may cease grains and ingest the elixir. This is the divine formula the Yellow Emperor received from Feng Hou, the Way of reversing aging and restoring youth.\n\n**Queen Mother’s Four-Youth Powder Formula**\nBefore ingesting the elixir, one must first take this powder to expel the dark *qi* of yin evil, preserve the yang *qi*, and harmonize the constructive and defensive *qi* of the six bowels.\n\nSesame, *tian men dong* (asparagus root), *fu ling* (poria), *mu* (wood), dried *huang jing* (Solomon’s seal), and peach kernels (remove the red skin, using only the white meat)—first roast the sesame until fragrant. Refine all six ingredients in equal parts and pound them thirty thousand times. Take three square *bi* each morning with wine, twice daily. It may also be taken with water or formed into honeyed pills, ingesting thirty each morning. This is the secret Way of returning to youthful innocence, excellently replenishing essence and nourishing the brain.\n\n**Lord Mao’s Five Varieties of Divine Mushroom Formula**\nOn Mount Juqu, there are five kinds of divine mushrooms. Daoists who aspire to immortality may obtain them. The method of seeking them: on an auspicious day in the third or ninth month, ascend the mountain with two pairs of precious rings—gold or jade will suffice—and present them as an offering to swear an oath. Repeat this three times to seal the pact, and you will surely obtain them. Cast the rings among the mountain stones without looking back. In the methods of immortality, green jade rings are prized as tokens of sincerity.\n\nThe first mushroom is called *Dragon Mushroom*, resembling intertwined dragons, its leaves like scales, its roots coiled like a dragon. Consuming it will make one a Supreme Subtlety Immortal Minister.\n\nThe second mushroom is called *Ginseng Mushroom*, red in color with a brilliant vermilion glow. Striking its branches and leaves produces a sound like metal or stone. If broken, it will rejoin when pressed together. Consuming it will make one a Supreme Subtlety Grand Master.\n\nThe third mushroom is called *Swallow Embryo Mushroom*, purple in color, shaped like vegetable leaves, with a swallow-like figure atop, as if about to take flight, its light bright and penetrating. Consuming a single stalk will make one a Grand Supreme Dragon-Tiger Immortal Lord and Orthodox Unity Gentleman.\n\nThe fourth mushroom is called *Moonlight Cave Grass Mushroom*, its color verdant, its fruit pure white, the size of a plum, three to four inches in height. Its leaves resemble those of the parasol tree. When viewed at night, its fruit shines like moonlight illuminating an entire chamber. Each stalk bears nine fruits; when they fall to the ground, they swiftly grow as large as a seven-inch mirror tray, one to two inches thick upon the earth. Seen at night, they resemble a crescent moon, shifting their gaze to regard the observer. Consuming a single stalk will make one the Left Imperial Censor of the Grand Clarity Immortal Palace.\n\nThe fifth mushroom is called *Jade-Stem Mushroom*; splitting open and consuming its cap will make one the Imperial Censor of the Three Bureaus.\n\nThe above five mushrooms were requested by the Three Lords to be cultivated within and beyond the Gourd Valley Mountains. Those who seek immortality—if their sincerity is profound and their mysterious heart fully devoted—may encounter the superior mushrooms. If one’s heart is not wholly dedicated to the Dao and virtue, only the lesser mushrooms may be seen. Those who seek the Way with negligence and indolence will not even secure their past attainments. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?\n\nThe five divine mushrooms possess wondrous numinous efficacy, and thus they are appended here at the end of the *Returning Elixir*. The *Essential Formulae of the Ninefold Cyclically Transmuted Elixir of the Supreme Subtlety Perfected One* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "In the tin melt, stir it, and in an instant, it will transform into white silver. Such transmutations signify the elixir’s completion. If testing proves unsuccessful, repeat the above method and refine it for another ninety days and nights—none will fail to succeed.\n\nTake the elixir dregs from the earthen crucible, pound them with five thousand strokes, blend them with white sandalwood honey, and form pills the size of parasol seeds, naming them the Supreme Ultimate Life-Restoring Divine Pills. For those who have died fewer than three days prior, pry open their mouths, insert two pills, and administer fresh water—they will revive at once. For wounds, mutilations, or deformities, blindness, or deafness, apply the divine pills as a salve, and all will be restored as before. For internal ailments, ingest two pills. For external afflictions, grind two pills into powder and apply it as a poultice—healing will be immediate. Whatever the malady, it will be cured by one’s own hand.\n\nTake one pill daily, and your lifespan will equal that of heaven and earth. When the divine pills are applied to objects, they will return to one’s hand of their own accord. As for the earthen crucible, take care not to destroy it, for it may be reused to compound the elixir. Simply reseal the upper and lower openings of the crucible more tightly, ensuring no impurity or negligence befalls it. When ready for use, plaster the interior and exterior with lead cinnabar mud, making it as thick as a finger’s width, following the previous method.\n\nIf the fire is weak and the allotted days have passed yet the elixir’s essence has not ascended, it is merely due to insufficient fire. Seal the crucible’s openings firmly once more and refine it for another thirty-six days—there will be no failure, and the ninety days and nights will no longer be necessary, for the process will be perfected.\n\nFirst, purify yourself for a hundred days, then prepare the divine crucible. Pound the ingredients to a fine consistency, and on the ninth day of the ninth month at dawn, kindle the fire. From the start of your purification, sever all worldly affairs and await the elixir’s completion.\n\nThose who compound the elixir should be of sincere heart, yearning for the Dao, pure and harmonious, loyal and trustworthy, free from excess, and steadfast in resolve—three such individuals will suffice. If such people are difficult to find, two will do. All must fast, bathe, and abstain from stepping over graves or encountering corpses, as well as from chickens and dogs—these are grave taboos.\n\nSome may ask why cultivation and refinement are so arduous—it is largely due to these very precautions. This Nine-Cycle Divine Elixir formula, transmitted as the oral instructions of Perfected Lord Wang, flows smoothly and is easy to compound. If the ingredients are of the finest quality, the purification rites meticulously observed, and the seclusion profound and tranquil, this formula’s divine efficacy will ensure success without fail.\n\nOn the day the purification begins, first offer five *hu* of clear wine to the flowing water at your dwelling. If the land lacks flowing water, use a fine well, pouring the wine into it to appease the earth’s *qi*. All who partake in the purification rites shall drink this water.\n\nWhen transmitting the divine scriptures and elixir instructions, one must swear a purification oath, using eight *liang* of golden fish and a jade dragon coiled in a ring as substitutes for the blood-oath of cutting hair. If such items are difficult to obtain in the world and one cannot permanently seal the numinous guardians, use forty *chi* of fine blue cloth as a pledge equivalent to the golden fish, and forty *chi* of heavy silk to match the jade dragon’s coiled ring. Together, present these to a master who possesses the scriptures, who shall distribute them to aid impoverished scholars in the mountains—one must not keep them for personal use, thereby demonstrating the celestial pact and showing impartiality. Those who violate the oath and leak the secrets will face the laws of the Four Poles. Guard this well and be cautious.\n\n**The Yellow Emperor’s Four-Fan Powder Formula**\nBefore refining and ingesting the Nine-Cycle Elixir, one should first take the following medicines to gradually dispel the impurities and ailments of the mundane world. By eliminating grains and purifying the five viscera and six bowels, one may attain perfection.\n\nPine resin, *ze xie* (water plantain), mulberry wood, dried ginger, mica, dried rehmannia, *shi shang pu* (stone-growing *Acorus*), and cinnamon—eight ingredients in total, refined in equal parts and pounded forty thousand times. Store them in a sealed vessel, ensuring no women, livestock, or impure things come into contact with them. Take three square *bi* each morning with wine, or water, or form honeyed pills the size of soybeans. Ingest twenty pills daily, increasing to thirty, and after half a season, the impurities will be purged, and all illnesses dispelled—then one may cease grains and ingest the elixir. This is the divine formula the Yellow Emperor received from Feng Hou, the Way of reversing aging and restoring youth.\n\n**Queen Mother’s Four-Youth Powder Formula**\nBefore ingesting the elixir, one must first take this powder to expel the dark *qi* of yin evil, preserve the yang *qi*, and harmonize the constructive and defensive *qi* of the six bowels.\n\nSesame, *tian men dong* (asparagus root), *fu ling* (poria), *mu* (wood), dried *huang jing* (Solomon’s seal), and peach kernels (remove the red skin, using only the white meat)—first roast the sesame until fragrant. Refine all six ingredients in equal parts and pound them thirty thousand times. Take three square *bi* each morning with wine, twice daily. It may also be taken with water or formed into honeyed pills, ingesting thirty each morning. This is the secret Way of returning to youthful innocence, excellently replenishing essence and nourishing the brain.\n\n**Lord Mao’s Five Varieties of Divine Mushroom Formula**\nOn Mount Juqu, there are five kinds of divine mushrooms. Daoists who aspire to immortality may obtain them. The method of seeking them: on an auspicious day in the third or ninth month, ascend the mountain with two pairs of precious rings—gold or jade will suffice—and present them as an offering to swear an oath. Repeat this three times to seal the pact, and you will surely obtain them. Cast the rings among the mountain stones without looking back. In the methods of immortality, green jade rings are prized as tokens of sincerity.\n\nThe first mushroom is called *Dragon Mushroom*, resembling intertwined dragons, its leaves like scales, its roots coiled like a dragon. Consuming it will make one a Supreme Subtlety Immortal Minister.\n\nThe second mushroom is called *Ginseng Mushroom*, red in color with a brilliant vermilion glow. Striking its branches and leaves produces a sound like metal or stone. If broken, it will rejoin when pressed together. Consuming it will make one a Supreme Subtlety Grand Master.\n\nThe third mushroom is called *Swallow Embryo Mushroom*, purple in color, shaped like vegetable leaves, with a swallow-like figure atop, as if about to take flight, its light bright and penetrating. Consuming a single stalk will make one a Grand Supreme Dragon-Tiger Immortal Lord and Orthodox Unity Gentleman.",

Add one *zhū* of the Nine-Cycle Essence to the lead, stir, and in an instant, it will transform into nine *jin* of yellow gold. Take one *jin* of mercury and seven *jin* of tin, place them in a pot, and heat until boiling three times. Add one *zhū* of the Nine-Cycle Essence, and it will transmute accordingly.",

      "translated_text": "The fourth mushroom is called *Moonlight Cave Grass Mushroom*, its color verdant, its fruit pure white, the size of a plum, three to four inches in height. Its leaves resemble those of the parasol tree. When viewed at night, its fruit shines like moonlight illuminating an entire chamber. Each stalk bears nine fruits; when they fall to the ground, they swiftly grow as large as a seven-inch mirror tray, one to two inches thick upon the earth. Seen at night, they resemble a crescent moon, shifting their gaze to regard the observer. Consuming a single stalk will make one the Left Imperial Censor of the Grand Clarity Immortal Palace.\n\nThe fifth mushroom is called *Jade-Stem Mushroom*; splitting open and consuming its cap will make one the Imperial Censor of the Three Bureaus.\n\nThe above five mushrooms were requested by the Three Lords to be cultivated within and beyond the Gourd Valley Mountains. Those who seek immortality—if their sincerity is profound and their mysterious heart fully devoted—may encounter the superior mushrooms. If one’s heart is not wholly dedicated to the Dao and virtue, only the lesser mushrooms may be seen. Those who seek the Way with negligence and indolence will not even secure their past attainments. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?\n\nThe five divine mushrooms possess wondrous numinous efficacy, and thus they are appended here at the end of the *Returning Elixir*.
