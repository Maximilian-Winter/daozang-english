  "full_translation": "**The Jade Purity Supreme Numinous Treasure Spontaneous Northern Dipper Original Birth True Sutra**\n\n**Sutra Title:** *The Jade Purity Supreme Numinous Treasure Spontaneous Northern Dipper Original Birth True Sutra*. The author is unknown, approximately dating to the Song or Yuan dynasties. It falsely attributes the narrative to the Primordial Celestial Venerable (Yuanshi Shangdi) instructing Baoshang Zhenren on the original birth of the Jade Purity Purple Radiance Lady, exhorting people to establish jiao rites and recite the *Nine Radiance True Sutra* to pray for wisdom, fortune, and longevity. Comprising one scroll, the base text is derived from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Cavernous Truth*, *Category of Original Texts*.\n\n---\n\n**The Jade Purity Supreme Numinous Treasure Spontaneous Northern Dipper Original Birth True Sutra**\n\nTransmitted by the Great Celestial Emperor of Life-Preservation, Lord of the Northern Culmen, Grand Controller of Destiny of the Thirty-Six Heavens\n\nOf the vast and boundless Dao, the radiant Crimson Clarity—when the Primordial One unfolded the cosmic chart, guiding and transforming all existence, manifesting great luminosity to illuminate the hundred thousand realms—within the Jade Purity Imperial Ultimate Palace, myriad lights were emitted: the Golden Treasury Cloud Radiance, the Jade Treasury Cloud Radiance, the Pearl Treasury Cloud Radiance, the Ocean Treasury Cloud Radiance, the Fragrance Treasury Cloud Radiance, the Flower Treasury Cloud Radiance, the Fire Treasury Cloud Radiance, and the Five Agents’ Radiance. These pervaded the heavens below and the human realm above, extending to the twelve thousand heavens and the eighty million lands. None failed to receive the power of the Primordial One, gathering as one to hear the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dao.\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable, the Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate, rested upon a luminous cloud-tablet, gazing down upon the multitude. He emitted a great Brahma-voice, like the thunderous resonance of celestial drums shaking the ten directions. All in the heavens above and the world below believed the Primordial Celestial Venerable spoke to them alone, and none were not filled with joy, reverently receiving his teaching.\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable then expounded profound mysteries, unfolding the abyssal depths of the utmost true Dao, dispelling the sun and moon of delusive clouds. At that moment, his dragon-voice roared like thunder, startling the ears and stirring the heart.\n\nThe Dao declared: \"The subtle mystery of the one mind encompasses the myriad scenes. What the one mind receives is inwardly and outwardly luminous, inherently without obstruction. Birth and death, going and coming—like shadows, like dreams—why invert and fixate, mistaking this for reality? Sinking into the waves of delusion, one cannot escape. \"\n\nAs this Dharma was being expounded, a Perfected One arose from his seat, bowing reverently a hundred times. Gazing up at the august countenance, he addressed the True Venerable: \"Your disciple is named Baoshang, foremost among the celestial sons. I now harbor a humble wish, hoping you will grant its expansion—this is my desire.\n\nThe seven stars of the Central Heaven stand majestic and resplendent, governing the host of luminaries, directing the revolutions of qi, measuring life and death. Their power is most weighty. By what karmic conditions are they preeminently supreme? From which kalpa did they arise, and what are the transformations of their beginning and end? I wish to hear this in detail.\"\n\nThe True Venerable sighed and said: \"Great indeed is your question! In the distant Dragon Han kalpa, there was a king named Zhou Yu, of boundless sagely virtue. The people received his blessings for eighty-four thousand great kalpas. The king had a jade consort, wise and compassionate, named the Purple Radiance Lady. She vowed through dust kalpas to generate the utmost aspiration: to give birth to a sagely son who would assist the cosmos and aid creation.\n\nAfter three thousand kalpas, this king appeared in the world. During the early spring, when a hundred flowers flourished, he sported in the rear garden. Arriving at the Golden Lotus Flower Warm Jade Pool, he disrobed to bathe. Suddenly, he was moved by a sensation. Nine lotus buds opened in response, giving birth to nine sons. The two eldest were the Heavenly August Great Emperor and the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor. The seven younger sons became the stars: Greedy Wolf, Giant Gate, Store of Wealth, Literary Brilliance, Integrity and Chastity, Martial Brilliance, and Breaker of Armies. Some benevolent, some malevolent, they transformed and guided the multitudes. Within the jade pool, over seven days and nights, they coalesced into radiance, flying to the Central Culmen, nine thousand million li above the earth, where they transformed into nine great treasure-palaces. The two eldest imperial lords resided in the Purple Tenuity Enclosure’s Great Void Palace, holding the position of the Curved Array, wielding talismans and charts, governing the primordial transformations, and serving as the sovereigns of the host of stars.\n\nIn the past, their great vows bound them to this unyielding world for seventy million kalpas before returning to the Jade Purity. The Purple Radiance Lady is also known as the Nine Perfected Sagely Virtue Heavenly Empress of the Northern Dipper, the Mysterious Heaven Great Sage True Empress, manifesting in the Southern Peak of the Upper Heavens as the Venerable of Celebration and Radiance, the Purple Radiance Crimson Emperor.\n\nIf faithful men and women, on the first spring day, single-mindedly purify themselves, solemnly revering the numinous, establish the Nine Radiance jiao rites, and reverently invite the Sagely Mother of Purple Radiance and the Seven Primes, offering devotion—even if burdened by the ten grave evils of many kalpas, or suffering from karmic adversaries and bitter retribution—it shall dissolve as swiftly as ice beneath the nine solar wheels. From kings and great ministers to common folk, those who uphold this will receive abundant blessings: their fortune and longevity shall increase, immeasurable celestial Perfected Ones will gather to protect them, their present life shall be fulfilled, their descendants shall flourish, and after death, they shall transcend to the Great Brahma True Heaven.\n\nIf the scholars of the world can constantly recite the *Nine Radiance True Sutra*, establish the Nine Radiance jiao rites, and uphold the name of Purple Radiance, their wisdom, fortune, and longevity shall flow like sweet springs, ever replenishing, inexhaustible in use. This merit is the foremost treasury in the world. You must propagate it to assist the flourishing of my Dao.\"\n\nBaoshang Zhenren, having heard the golden words proclaimed, rejoiced with the celestial multitude, gratefully acknowledging the vast grace. Each arose in thought: \"We shall make offerings to the True Venerable. His grace is like that of father and mother—difficult to repay.\" Thereupon, each exercised their numinous powers, scattering from the mysterious void a hundred thousand myriad kinds of radiance: immeasurable treasure-radiance, immeasurable fragrant-radiance, immeasurable cloud-radiance, immeasurable rain-radiance. Celestial music sounded without being struck, harmonizing in rhythm. Immeasurable great treasure-palaces of radiance spiraled down from the void, arriving before the True Venerable as offerings. Countless Perfected Ones, with a single voice, extolled the True Brahma, reciting the gatha:\n\nThe majestic Primordial Venerable,\nIn numinous powers stands foremost.\nNone in the world can compare—\nLike the sun illuminating the ten thousand heavens.\nHis wisdom vast, his expedient means,\nTransform all sentient beings.\nWith ten thousand bodies we,\nEach body with ten thousand tongues,\nExtol the Dao of the True Venerable—\nEven through kalpas unending, it cannot be exhausted.\n\nHow benevolent, the Purple Radiance Heaven,\nSkilled in manifesting forms:\nMale or female in appearance,\nAdapting to beings as they require.\nWe take refuge in the Northern Dipper Mother,\nThe inexhaustible ocean of merit and virtue.\nForever the eyes of the blind,\nIlluminating past and present.\n\nHis merit and virtue, with the Primordial One,\nPermeate inner and outer transformations.\nForging the great vessels of the Dharma,\nUniversally perfecting the boundless Perfected Ones.\n\nThe Precious Supreme Perfected One and the celestial multitude, having recited this gatha, all the heavenly spirits paid reverence to the True Venerable and, offering their parting words, withdrew.\n\nHere ends the *Jade Purity Supreme Numinous Treasure Spontaneous Northern Dipper Original Birth True Sutra*.",
