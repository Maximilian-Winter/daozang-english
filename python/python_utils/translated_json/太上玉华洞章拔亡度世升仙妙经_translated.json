  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Jade Flower Grotto Scripture for Deliverance of the Deceased, Salvation of the World, and Ascension to Immortality**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Jade Flower Grotto Scripture for Deliverance of the Deceased, Salvation of the World, and Ascension to Immortality*. The original text does not specify an author. According to the postscript, it was composed by Du Changchun, a Daoist novice of Tianning Wanshou Abbey in Fenzhou, Shanxi, in the second year of the Huangtong reign of the Jin dynasty.\n\nThe scripture attributes its teachings to the Primordial Celestial Worthy, who expounds to the Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery on the salvation of sentient beings, the dissolution of calamities, and the attainment of the Dao. It consists of one scroll.\n\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Dongzhen Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter One: The Grotto Scripture for Delivering the Suffering from the Dark Prison and Rescuing the Sinful**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Worthy was upon the Jade Clarity Realm, within the Mystery Capital Mountain. Ascending a nine-hued azure radiance throne, he sounded golden chimes and jade chimes, summoning the sacred assembly. The Five Venerable Lords, the Ten Lofty Perfected, the Sovereigns of the Nine Heavens, the Origin Lords of the Three Realms, the multitudes of realized beings from the ten directions, and countless heavenly beings gathered in unison for the Dharma assembly.\n\nThen, a Perfected One named Penetrating Mystery stepped forth from the assembly, holding a tablet and kneeling in reverence. Bowing his head to the Celestial Worthy, he said: \"I have heard that in the lower world of desire, sentient beings do not fathom the true teaching. Each gives rise to perverse thoughts, competing in greed—for superiority, nobility, glory, wealth, property, treasures, karma, enmity, harm, injury, love, wrath, attachment, and desire. They engage in deceit, stinginess, resentment, flattery, craftiness, hypocrisy, arrogance, and frivolity. Their natures are violent, obstinate, jealous, and venomous, committing the ten evils and five rebellions. Following their hearts, they abandon poverty, lowliness, cultivation, goodness, compassion, pity, nature, life, origin, and truth. Their greed and abandonment know no rest. Thus, their human and heavenly destinies are unstable, and the ghostly path becomes their easy refuge. Deprived of luminous vision, they fall into the dark gates, sinking for ten thousand kalpas without liberation.\n\nAmong them, those who fear death and cling to life may practice swallowing mist and abstaining from grain, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, or bending and stretching to guide the qi, hoping to attain the path of longevity. Yet, when their years are exhausted, they encounter the turning kalpas, cannot escape death, and are not recorded in the registers of immortals. As their lives end, they descend to the earthly courts. What karmic causes distinguish such beings, preventing them from attaining the Dao’s fruit?\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy replied: \"These beings seek only benefit for themselves and their kin, without thought of aiding or saving others. Their aspirations do not adhere to the One Dharma, and their minds do not relinquish the Ten Matters.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery bowed again and asked: \"What are the Ten Matters?\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy declared:\n1. **Disrespecting heaven and earth, disloyalty to the sovereign.**\n2. **Disobedience to parents, neglect of ancestral rites.**\n3. **Harboring deceit, giving rise to resentment and jealousy.**\n4. **Lust and debauchery leading to ruin, instability in life.**\n5. **Unsevered worldly attachments, vain thoughts of honor and disgrace.**\n6. **Harming others to secure oneself, oppressing the poor while courting the rich.**\n7. **Slaughtering living beings, inflicting suffering through butchery.**\n8. **Consuming meat and wine, indulging in impure diets.**\n9. **Disrespecting teachers and the Dharma, fostering jealousy and malice.**\n10. **Deceiving the truly enlightened, leading others astray onto deluded paths.**\n\n\"Due to these Ten Matters, which cling to body and mind, the three karmic actions sow themselves, and the ten evils arise in the heart. Toward the true Dharma, they generate endless distinctions. Thus, they cannot attain the path of longevity, the gate of deathlessness, or the Yang realm, instead falling into the dark gates.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery said: \"I have heard that the dark gates are the eternal night’s abode, deep within the ghostly realm, governed by Luo Feng. Within it dwell demon kings, the Lords of the Six Grottoes, the Twelve Lesser Grottoes, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Twenty Departments, and the Eighteen, Twenty-Four, Thirty-Six, Eighty-One, and One Hundred Twenty Hells. These great hells stand thirty-six myriad miles high, their roots plunging thirty-six myriad miles into the waters below. There, sinful souls are examined and punished. Winds and thunder, lightning bolts, flying spears and drifting halberds, layers of fiery veils, iron enclosures ten thousand fathoms high, golden hammers and iron staves, icy blades and frosty edges, bronze pillars and iron wheels, venomous serpents and fierce beasts, knife mountains and sword trees, ice pools and fire chariots, cauldrons of boiling water and pestles for pounding, grinding wheels and dark mills, saws for dismemberment and plows for tilling—myriad torments endure without pause. For eternal kalpas in the dark netherworld, suffering knows no day or night. The cries of agony shake heaven and earth, unbearable to hear. In this realm, sinful souls find no deliverance. I beseech the Celestial Worthy to bestow compassion and universally rescue them.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy said: \"In the netherworld, those who perished earlier and later—all sinful beings—while in the Yang realm, did not shun life and death. They toiled and schemed, deluding and clinging to themselves, obstinate and foolish. They forged their own fetters and shackles, cast their own nets and snares, entangled and ensnared themselves, bound and shackled themselves, maimed and harmed themselves, damaged and ruined themselves. By their own will and actions, they accumulated immeasurable transgressions. Upon death, they face the hells’ punishments and torments—this is not the hells’ imposition, but the self-inflicted retribution of sentient beings.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery said: \"May the Celestial Worthy, in great compassion and mercy, momentarily radiate his majestic light to penetrate the demonic mountains, absolve the sinful souls, and lead them from the dark abyss. May they attain rebirth in the human and heavenly realms, revere the Great Dao, and behold the immortal winds.\n\nMoreover, in the world below, as kalpas turn and dissolve, disasters of flood and drought, warfare and banditry, plagues and poisons ravage the people, causing countless deaths. The six paths of rebirth know no rest. I beseech the Celestial Worthy to universally bestow benevolence, broadly deliver the drowned, liberate them from suffering, and let them behold the light.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy said: \"I possess the Jade Palace’s golden scriptures, hidden in the Mystery Capital’s upper halls, unknown to the world below. They can eliminate heavenly calamities, verify the self, dispel ghostly misfortunes, sever karmic ties, attain longevity, transcend the eternal night, and ascend to the Yang heavens. I shall now reveal and clarify this path for you.\"\n\n**The Wondrous Chapter on the Transformation of Being through Non-Being, Movement, and Stillness (II)**\n\nNon-being and being, movement and stillness—these are the root of transformation. Yin and yang intermingle, and the gate of the indistinct opens. Spirit is the essence of transformation; qi is the cause of generation. Hard and soft, compliance and resistance, inner and outer, floating and sinking—embracing the flower and structuring the essence, thus do all things transform and come to be.\n\nIn the primal chaos of nature, through kalpas vast and round as the numinous, the heavens imbibe qi, and the fire-image dawns in clarity. Movement in extremity brings forth calamity; stillness in extremity gives rise to springs. Yang exhales, yin inhales—being and non-being unite as one. The four seasons nurture growth, the two qi revolve in harmony. In spring, wood conceives fire, which blazes red in summer; in autumn, metal nurtures water, which flows clear in winter. Above and below respond to one another, and the wellspring of transformation is renewed. The five movements commence their unfolding, their roots uniting and parting.\n\nYang’s womb and yin’s embryo are guarded and stabilized by spirit. Spirit is the essence of transformation; qi is the cause of generation. Spirit is the root of the heart, and the heart follows intention. The myriad spirits abide in serene numinosity, true qi suffuses all. A thousand origins converge as one, together guarding the jade radiance. Yin’s po undergoes vast transformation; yang’s hun holds fast to life. Nine changes and ten unions link the golden towers. Water becomes the Great One, its form like a lotus in bloom. The great spirit of transformation, jade-fair and refined, extends in purity. Within the nine qi of the great void lies a jade abyss, its profound depths receiving all images. The stars and constellations course within, the Crimson Clarity unfolds its chart, and the workings of nature come full circle. The Winnowing Basket revolves, the Dipper traces its path, and true qi ascends to the Upper Origin. The Eight Effulgences merge in darkness, vanishing into the Mysterious Spring. The Mysterious is the mother of spirit, yin commands the yang officials. Being and non-being nurture growth; movement and stillness range from vast to minute. Through adversity, harmony is restored; earth unites with heaven. The left is entrusted to the right, the last reaches the first. The mechanism of the supreme Dao lies beyond all barriers in the great void. The True One equals emptiness, the freshness of transformation unfolds. Transformation reaches its limit and changes; change reaches its limit and becomes mysterious. Within the mysterious abides the True Sovereign, united in the Great Harmony. The myriad qi align as one, the gate of white clouds. Qi flows like a spring, nourishing the primal source. Vast and profoundly mysterious!\n\n---\n\n**The Wondrous Chapter on the Three Flowers’ Beginning, Embryo Protection, and Life Preservation (III)**\n\nBefore heaven and earth came to be, primordial qi commenced its unfolding. For ninety billion kalpas, the three qi intermingled. After ninety great kalpas, the Three Flowers first divided. The Five Elders repaired the embryo, the Three Origins nurtured the hun. The Dao’s workings through spirit-transformation naturally perfected the true. The Great Dark divided and divided again, the great Dao lay hidden within. In an instant, it responded and transformed, giving rise to spirit and essence. Spirit is the numen of things; through it, the primal chaos was accomplished. Inner and outer harmonized, the two images settled in purity. White was entrusted to red, yin and yang merged; red was entrusted to black, and the embryo congealed. Within lay the Great Void, luminous with the Three Clarities. The spirit-void towered in majesty, primordial qi shone brightly. Within dwelt the numinous youth, emerging from the mysterious and entering the azure. The purple womb loosened its sash, revealing the true form in radiant clarity. The immortal and mysterious shed its fetal husk, giving birth to the divine hero. Its majesty and deportment transformed in unison, vanishing into profound obscurity. Within the obscure abides the essence, the spirit of utmost truth. There is a spirit that can illumine, a spirit that can brighten, a spirit that can establish, a spirit that can generate, a spirit that can flourish, a spirit that can purify. It establishes all beings and things, the wondrous court of the Three Flowers. Within the purple pavilion and vermilion palace, the fetal light shines with numinous clarity, concealed within the jade root. Subtle and serene, within it lies the embryo’s protector—the Lord of the Fire of Shu. Within it lies the transforming infant—the Spirit of Hetu. Within it lies the male overseer—the Lord of Bohua. Within it lies the cloud chamber—the true one of the courtyard. The male calls out, \"Mengfei\"; the female calls out, \"Ziyi.\" The primordial embryo is refined and perfected, a hundred blessings come in peace. Preserving its purity, it attains the true—without thought, the primordial act.\n\n---\n\n**The Wondrous Chapter on the Generation of Heaven and Earth and the Separation and Union of the Two Modes (IV)**\n\nAt the Great Beginning’s first arising, within the true and obscure, no thing had yet taken form. Purple clouds came to welcome it; the round transformation returned to the true. The Yellow Person descended in numinosity, the Primal Elder held the talisman, and the Three Realms dawned in clarity. Heaven was purified, earth was pacified, pure yang came to be. Its majesty and spirit were numinous, and the myriad things were accomplished. The qi of Fan billowed to the left, the radiance of Mi suffused the right. Heaven draped its resplendent hues, earth surged with jade radiance. Qian and Kun stilled in silence, penetrating wisdom and clarity. The luminous effulgence manifested in brightness, the vermilion armor and yang banners. The Tail and Triaster stars stood guard in front, nurturing the hun and benefiting the true. Flying breaths and drawn zithers, delighting in the Dao as companions. The nine heavens and eight poles, great kalpas intersecting in cycles. The primordial mandate was established, distributed across the nine mounds. The Great Beginning culminated in the Nine Yangs, the Great Simplicity culminated in the Six Yins. Transforming to align with the true, its unfolding brought no sorrow. To the left, the Yellow Youth was summoned; to the right, the Earth Spirit was welcomed. Yang’s vigor and yin’s brilliance, primordial essence transformed into one. The two modes ascended and descended, harmonizing naturally. The four seasons followed virtue, nurturing and forgetting transgressions. The hundred spirits coordinated transformation, the myriad things flourished in abundance. Customs were pure and generous, the wondrous chapters were revered. The five phases moved in prosperity, their essence true and constant. They could be obscure or luminous, present or absent. Knowing and practicing this, one drives away yin and employs yang. Externally, glory expands its pattern; internally, one guards the celestial mystery. Forgetting mechanisms both inner and outer, one accords with the true canon. The Primal Sovereign of the Great Ultimate, the subtle and mysterious Dao. The August Emperor held the key, opening the gates of heaven. The golden true shone in luster, its echoes like cloud-borne simurghs. The jade tones gathered qi, numinous winds amassed mist. Purple mushrooms nurtured excellence, giving rise to fetal immortals.\n\n---\n\n**The Wondrous Chapter on the Five Phases’ Completion and the Realm of Longevity for Living Beings (V)**\n\nWhen heaven and earth first divided, the great Dao’s essential subtlety unfolded. The Three Powers operated, the five phases held numinous essence. The qi of the celestial circuit—six periods complete its great accomplishment. The end of the earth’s era—five years complete its minor accomplishment. The five phases flourished in abundance, auspicious qi settled in equilibrium. People suffered no premature death, fulfilling their heavenly years. Thus was good fortune and prosperity achieved. The correct gong and zheng tones became the Great One; the lesser gong and zheng tones became the Great Simplicity. When the five phases are balanced, yin and yang do not clash. When yang’s methods are applied in sequence, longevity and immortality are attained. When primordial transformation is lush and fragrant, life and death enter and exit, feather-transformation achieves immortality, silently harmonizing with the Dao’s essence. The crystals of the five stars descended in numinous form. With qi’s workings complete, the supreme Dao ascends. The movement of the five qi repairs deficiencies and balances ascent. It continues the era and extends years, its workings reaching the source of transformation. Knowing the mechanism of life, one grasps the root of the Dao. When the five phases prosper, their number culminates in nine. Nine transforms into one, one transforms into nine. Nurturing to become one, without excess or deficiency. Metal and wood engender one another; water and fire achieve balance. One qi fills all, wisdom’s nature arises from the source. Harmonizing the four images, after nine years one ascends to the true. Emerging from darkness and entering quiescence, nurturing and generating life. The five qi settle in peace, eternally preserving ascendant harmony. The high heavens are limpid and clear, the great earth is secure and flourishing. With hearts turned toward the utmost true, all attain the immortal isles. The living and the dead receive blessings, ten cycles deliver humanity. The Great Clarity is vast and boundless, its wondrous pattern misty and suffused. United in a single radiance, it illuminates the profound root of the mysterious. The spirit-one floats in effulgence, the Great Flower gives forth sound. The Three Mysteries descend in submission, possessing qi and possessing form. Auspicious signs generate blessings, yin returns to yang’s brightness. The Great Simplicity and the Orthodox One open the chart of life’s deliverance. The Most High shines in glory, universally bestowing celestial grace. Azure tablets inscribed with phoenix-script, cinnabar scrolls written in dragon-characters. Towering and majestic, the Mysterious Capital; misty and grand, the cloud-borne chariots. The wondrous realm of the Supreme Tenuity, the dwelling of the true sages.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Wondrous Transformations of Spirit and Qi, Boundless and Inexhaustible**\n\nSpirit transforms without end, qi transforms to the primordial extreme. Knowing the Dao is manifest; the Orthodox One’s spirit and qi attain their wondrous use. Kan and Li unite in harmony, yin and yang achieve balance. The spirit does not leave the body, true qi flourishes within. The spirit does not depart the form, ensuring longevity and enduring vision. Within, it circulates through numinous realms; without, it emerges from the dust-sealed gate. Qi transforms in equal measure, roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital. Spirit and qi guard each other, congealing to form the infant. The inner landscape is serene, the Golden Pond and Jade Nourishment harmonized. The spirit’s awareness transcends, a single qi ascends as one. The spirit becomes the Nine Perfected, qi transforms through the Nine Palaces. Pristine and unadorned, the Great Simplicity shines with the wondrous root. Attaining the primordial work, the spirit is supremely wondrous, the true is supremely numinous. Grasping the One, the myriad qi align; heaven is clear, earth is tranquil. This is the mechanism of the Dao, the birth of the Dao. In myriad wondrous courts, the true realm gleams resplendent. Mother and child rejoice in reunion, ascending to appear before the Three Clarities. The yang spirit becomes heaven, the yin qi becomes the spring. The Great Ultimate is without color, the Great Beginning conceals its explanation. Vast and obscure, heaven and earth are profoundly still. Without form or name, the ten thousand images arise. Standing alone in the great void, it blends with the myriad spirits. Its transformations are boundless, giving birth to the ten thousand existences. Grasping the primordial chaos, it traverses the vast immortal palaces. At first, the spring breeze is seen, bright and self-responsive. This is called the Supreme Spirit. The immortals of the Three Realms, the cloud peaks of all heavens—spirit transforms and circulates everywhere, all through the Dao’s presence. This Dao is secret and profound; only by attaining it is one truly real.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: Merging Life and Death, Refining Qi to Transform into Immortals**\n\nRefining qi to transform into immortals is the supreme wondrous Dao. Recognizing the Dao, words vanish; the Great Clarity is supremely luminous. Qi is soft, qi is firm; qi is square, qi is round. Qi surges, qi penetrates; qi is fresh, qi flourishes. Speech is the flower of primal harmony; the mouth utters no evil sounds. With qi, one harmonizes with the Dao; with the Dao, one harmonizes with the true. The hundred spirits gather, auspicious qi stretches endlessly. The five viscera and six bowels emerge from nonbeing into being. Profound beyond profundity, it endures eternally. Qi transforms into spirit, the Five Elders attend in guard. The Three Origins revolve, sweeping away the nine impurities. When qi reaches its extreme, it communicates with the primordial. The Great Perfected’s wondrous pattern: my qi is not a thing, yet it can generate all things. My qi is without emotion, yet it can transform the emotional. Qi is the mother of the Dao, qi is the great spirit. In movement, it becomes being; in stillness, it becomes the mysterious. The ten thousand things’ creation, the wise and foolish, the worthy and dull—all officials, high and low, are nurtured by the Dao. Responding to the season, the embryonic immortal forms; the great creation takes shape. As qi is sensed, its wondrous transmission follows. Whether absent or present, the Rainbow Capital and Jasper Pond, the Sunlit Nectar Abyss—nurturing and aiding transformation, auspicious hues hang high. The spirit roams in tranquil realms, delighting in the Dao’s immortal source.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight: Water and Fire Ascend to Attain Longevity and Enduring Vision**\n\nThe Dao’s root is profoundly mysterious, born yet not perishing, enduring vision without decline. Yet it has no shrine. It illumines the Three Realms, flowing through life and death. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped—is this called the limit? The limitless, the boundless! Discussing its utmost subtlety, it cannot be deceived. Attaining its beneficial use, it irrigates the celestial pond, nurturing and aiding all without omission. Lighting a lamp beneath the water, reversing the course—returning from old age to infancy, only the adept gallops alone. The clumsy in nurturing, the wise find it hard to fathom. Overflowing and drowning, the supreme sage extends compassion, saving those in peril, delivering them from danger. Skilled in application, wondrously activating the mysterious mechanism: on yin days, fire is added. The Five Agents remain unharmed; fire’s concealment deepens, yet it cannot be diminished. The fire of utmost truth shines brilliantly along the celestial path. When it flashes like lightning, its light reaches the Nine Heavens. The supremely good bestow blessings without partiality. When the body encounters the kalpa fire, a lotus blooms within the flames. Guarding stillness against haste, how could it contend with things? Yang fears yin’s interference, harming the numinous explanation. Attaining this utmost profundity, nurturing reaches equal measure. The deluded multiply confusion, burning harmony and destroying peace—like moths rushing to flame, never turning back. The Celestial Thearch pities and heals the decayed; not one in ten thousand is lost. Perceiving the wondrous mystery, fire is added in yang times—longevity arises naturally. Knowing these two, one conceals essence within, silently observing the yang heavens. Within the realm of no life or death, the true realm appears of itself. The Dao unites with spirit, manifesting and communicating the mysterious. The Dao’s root is nonaction, the Dao’s root is ever-fresh. Reviving the bones from death, qi restores the primordial. Heaven’s light enters the body, enduring through eternal mystery.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine: Transcending Death and Birth, Proving the Mortal to Become a Sage**\n\nThe wondrous Dao is subtly mysterious, able to escape life and death. It does not enter the flowing waves, does not dwell in dazzling scenes. It is not stained by worldly splendor, not entangled in fame or profit. It does not pursue greed, does not arise in hatred or love. It does not generate deluded thoughts, does not produce contemplative念. Cutting off the gate of death, it opens the gate of life. The Great One communicates with the numinous; the Five Agents’ qi gathers. The Four Images arise together, the Yellow Court’s Great Thearch. The true realm is pure and clear, the Primordial True Treasure. It pours upon the crown, filling to abundance. Floating and sinking, rising and falling, it eternally preserves integrity. The hundred demons are bound and subdued, the myriad spirits shrink away. In stillness and silence, ever tranquil, the hundred spirits follow in attendance. The celestial stems and branches of the Zhou Tian cycle are carefully examined with utmost sincerity. The Northern Mansion erases records, the Southern Tablet marks names. In the left hand, a golden tablet; in the right, a jade scepter. Phoenixes and cranes, heavenly immortals, come and go in ascent. Form and spirit are tranquil, vast and boundless, luminous and bright. The utmost Dao is eternally firm; the three hun-souls manifest their numinosity. Kan and Li harmonize, nurturing the immortal embryo. Proving the mortal to ascend as a sage.\n\n---\n\nThe Perfected of Penetrating the Mysterious bows in reverence and gives thanks: Your servants are deeply grateful for your compassionate grace, illuminating and bestowing the true teachings. The assembled perfected pay homage; the nation is prosperous, the people are abundant. Fengdu is tranquil and silent; the Three Realms rejoice.\n\nThe Perfected of Penetrating the Mysterious addresses the assembled sages: Today, we are fortunate to receive the master’s transmission. Each of us reverently upholds it, reciting the true scripture. Its merit is inexhaustible. If one encounters the Jade Flower’s numinous text and wishes to recite it, one should first purify the heart and calm the mind, fast and bathe, burn incense, and pay homage to the ten directions, each three times. Then, facing east, sit evenly, gather the spirit, and settle the will. Reciting the scripture once averts misfortune. Reciting it ten times, all evil returns to rectitude. Reciting it a hundred times, spirits and ghosts submit. Reciting it a thousand times, one attains long life. Reciting it ten thousand times, one ascends nine generations above and shades seven below, ultimately proving one’s own body, eternally becoming a denizen of the celestial palace. In this world, do not forget—believe, accept, and practice.\n\nThe *Exalted Jade Flower Grotto Scripture for Delivering the Deceased, Transcending the World, and Ascending as an Immortal* concludes.\n\nAn Account of the Scripture’s Transmission\n\nThe Tianning Wanshou Abbey in Fenzhou was originally the Kaiyuan Abbey of the Tang, the dwelling place of Adept Yan. The adept expounded utmost virtue and propagated the mysterious Daoist teachings, a rare master of the Dao. To this day, over four hundred years later, the Tang and Song inscriptions and odes by Zhao and Yan remain carved in stone, available for examination.\n\nAfter the ravages of war, the ranks of Daoist clergy had dwindled. In the winter of the second year of the Huangtong era, the Daoist community gathered and sighed, saying: *\"Shall we not feel shame before the former adept?\"* They had recently heard of a certain Du Changchun in the western outskirts of Xiaoyi—a youth not yet come of age—who, while herding sheep, had encountered an immortal perfected one. In a single evening, he suddenly attained awakening, as one awakens from a dream or sobers from drunkenness. He discoursed on the subtle and profound, instructed through poetry and verse, and his calligraphy flowed like dragons and serpents. Moreover, he wrote talismans and chanted incantations over water to cure illnesses. Far and near, those who heard of his reputation were delighted and wished to invite him to reside in their abbey to propagate the teachings, thereby glorifying the former master and reviving the Daoist tradition. Would this not be fitting?\n\nThe Daoist community rejoiced, and together with those who revered the Dao, they constructed an abbey behind the main hall, extending corridors and planting pines and bamboo. They then journeyed to Xiaoyi to invite Changchun to reside in the abbey and propagate the teachings.\n\nThe following year, on the Lantern Festival, a grand offering was held, attended by nearly a thousand people. One leisurely day, Du Changchun addressed the Daoist community, saying: *\"I possess a scroll of an Exalted Perfected Scripture that has not yet circulated in the world. Today, I wish to transmit it to you. When recited, this scripture dispels heavenly calamities above, verifies the self within, and averts ghostly misfortunes below. It delivers from suffering, absolves transgressions, and grants longevity and enduring vision—such is the essence of cultivating the true Dao and attaining the Way.\"*\n\nThe Daoist community was overjoyed and eager to hear the details. On the True Origin Festival in the second month, an offering was prepared to request the scripture, and they pledged to receive and practice it faithfully. By the Shangsi Festival in the third month, an offering was held to transmit a scroll of the scripture, titled *The Exalted Jade Flower Grotto Scripture for Delivering the Deceased, Transcending the World, and Ascending as an Immortal*. Inscribed on silk, it comprised over three thousand characters in nine chapters, followed by the perfected one’s numinous talismans and divine incantations at the end of the scroll.\n\nOn that day, fragrant flowers gathered in abundance. The scripture was borne in procession to the Hall of Great Empyrean before the sacred thrones of the Three Clarities. The assembly read it aloud as the crowd knelt in reverence, receiving it upon their crowns. None failed to vow to recite it for the rest of their lives. Woodblocks were then carved, and prints were made into scrolls, distributed widely among those who revered the Dao, thereby broadening its transmission.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Jade Flower Grotto Scripture for Deliverance of the Deceased, Salvation of the World, and Ascension to Immortality**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Jade Flower Grotto Scripture for Deliverance of the Deceased, Salvation of the World, and Ascension to Immortality*. The original text does not specify an author. According to the postscript, it was composed by Du Changchun, a Daoist novice of Tianning Wanshou Abbey in Fenzhou, Shanxi, in the second year of the Huangtong reign of the Jin dynasty.\n\nThe scripture attributes its teachings to the Primordial Celestial Worthy, who expounds to the Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery on the salvation of sentient beings, the dissolution of calamities, and the attainment of the Dao. It consists of one scroll.\n\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Dongzhen Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter One: The Grotto Scripture for Delivering the Suffering from the Dark Prison and Rescuing the Sinful**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Worthy was upon the Jade Clarity Realm, within the Mystery Capital Mountain. Ascending a nine-hued azure radiance throne, he sounded golden chimes and jade chimes, summoning the sacred assembly. The Five Venerable Lords, the Ten Lofty Perfected, the Sovereigns of the Nine Heavens, the Origin Lords of the Three Realms, the multitudes of realized beings from the ten directions, and countless heavenly beings gathered in unison for the Dharma assembly.\n\nThen, a Perfected One named Penetrating Mystery stepped forth from the assembly, holding a tablet and kneeling in reverence. Bowing his head to the Celestial Worthy, he said: \"I have heard that in the lower world of desire, sentient beings do not fathom the true teaching. Each gives rise to perverse thoughts, competing in greed—for superiority, nobility, glory, wealth, property, treasures, karma, enmity, harm, injury, love, wrath, attachment, and desire. They engage in deceit, stinginess, resentment, flattery, craftiness, hypocrisy, arrogance, and frivolity. Their natures are violent, obstinate, jealous, and venomous, committing the ten evils and five rebellions. Following their hearts, they abandon poverty, lowliness, cultivation, goodness, compassion, pity, nature, life, origin, and truth. Their greed and abandonment know no rest. Thus, their human and heavenly destinies are unstable, and the ghostly path becomes their easy refuge. Deprived of luminous vision, they fall into the dark gates, sinking for ten thousand kalpas without liberation.\n\nAmong them, those who fear death and cling to life may practice swallowing mist and abstaining from grain, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, or bending and stretching to guide the qi, hoping to attain the path of longevity. Yet, when their years are exhausted, they encounter the turning kalpas, cannot escape death, and are not recorded in the registers of immortals. As their lives end, they descend to the earthly courts. What karmic causes distinguish such beings, preventing them from attaining the Dao’s fruit?\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy replied: \"These beings seek only benefit for themselves and their kin, without thought of aiding or saving others. Their aspirations do not adhere to the One Dharma, and their minds do not relinquish the Ten Matters.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery bowed again and asked: \"What are the Ten Matters?\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy declared:\n1. **Disrespecting heaven and earth, disloyalty to the sovereign.**\n2. **Disobedience to parents, neglect of ancestral rites.**\n3. **Harboring deceit, giving rise to resentment and jealousy.**\n4. **Lust and debauchery leading to ruin, instability in life.**\n5. **Unsevered worldly attachments, vain thoughts of honor and disgrace.**\n6. **Harming others to secure oneself, oppressing the poor while courting the rich.**\n7. **Slaughtering living beings, inflicting suffering through butchery.**\n8. **Consuming meat and wine, indulging in impure diets.**\n9. **Disrespecting teachers and the Dharma, fostering jealousy and malice.**\n10. **Deceiving the truly enlightened, leading others astray onto deluded paths.**\n\n\"Due to these Ten Matters, which cling to body and mind, the three karmic actions sow themselves, and the ten evils arise in the heart. Toward the true Dharma, they generate endless distinctions. Thus, they cannot attain the path of longevity, the gate of deathlessness, or the Yang realm, instead falling into the dark gates.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery said: \"I have heard that the dark gates are the eternal night’s abode, deep within the ghostly realm, governed by Luo Feng. Within it dwell demon kings, the Lords of the Six Grottoes, the Twelve Lesser Grottoes, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Twenty Departments, and the Eighteen, Twenty-Four, Thirty-Six, Eighty-One, and One Hundred Twenty Hells. These great hells stand thirty-six myriad miles high, their roots plunging thirty-six myriad miles into the waters below. There, sinful souls are examined and punished. Winds and thunder, lightning bolts, flying spears and drifting halberds, layers of fiery veils, iron enclosures ten thousand fathoms high, golden hammers and iron staves, icy blades and frosty edges, bronze pillars and iron wheels, venomous serpents and fierce beasts, knife mountains and sword trees, ice pools and fire chariots, cauldrons of boiling water and pestles for pounding, grinding wheels and dark mills, saws for dismemberment and plows for tilling—myriad torments endure without pause. For eternal kalpas in the dark netherworld, suffering knows no day or night. The cries of agony shake heaven and earth, unbearable to hear. In this realm, sinful souls find no deliverance. I beseech the Celestial Worthy to bestow compassion and universally rescue them.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy said: \"In the netherworld, those who perished earlier and later—all sinful beings—while in the Yang realm, did not shun life and death. They toiled and schemed, deluding and clinging to themselves, obstinate and foolish. They forged their own fetters and shackles, cast their own nets and snares, entangled and ensnared themselves, bound and shackled themselves, maimed and harmed themselves, damaged and ruined themselves. By their own will and actions, they accumulated immeasurable transgressions. Upon death, they face the hells’ punishments and torments—this is not the hells’ imposition, but the self-inflicted retribution of sentient beings.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery said: \"May the Celestial Worthy, in great compassion and mercy, momentarily radiate his majestic light to penetrate the demonic mountains, absolve the sinful souls, and lead them from the dark abyss. May they attain rebirth in the human and heavenly realms, revere the Great Dao, and behold the immortal winds.\n\nMoreover, in the world below, as kalpas turn and dissolve, disasters of flood and drought, warfare and banditry, plagues and poisons ravage the people, causing countless deaths. The six paths of rebirth know no rest. I beseech the Celestial Worthy to universally bestow benevolence, broadly deliver the drowned, liberate them from suffering, and let them behold the light.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy said: \"I possess the Jade Palace’s golden scriptures, hidden in the Mystery Capital’s upper halls, unknown to the world below. They can eliminate heavenly calamities, verify the self, dispel ghostly misfortunes, sever karmic ties, attain longevity, transcend the eternal night, and ascend to the Yang heavens. I shall now reveal and clarify this path for you.\"",

      "translated_text": "**The Wondrous Chapter on the Transformation of Being through Non-Being, Movement, and Stillness (II)**\n\nNon-being and being, movement and stillness—these are the root of transformation. Yin and yang intermingle, and the gate of the indistinct opens. Spirit is the essence of transformation; qi is the cause of generation. Hard and soft, compliance and resistance, inner and outer, floating and sinking—embracing the flower and structuring the essence, thus do all things transform and come to be.\n\nIn the primal chaos of nature, through kalpas vast and round as the numinous, the heavens imbibe qi, and the fire-image dawns in clarity. Movement in extremity brings forth calamity; stillness in extremity gives rise to springs. Yang exhales, yin inhales—being and non-being unite as one. The four seasons nurture growth, the two qi revolve in harmony. In spring, wood conceives fire, which blazes red in summer; in autumn, metal nurtures water, which flows clear in winter. Above and below respond to one another, and the wellspring of transformation is renewed. The five movements commence their unfolding, their roots uniting and parting.\n\nYang’s womb and yin’s embryo are guarded and stabilized by spirit. Spirit is the essence of transformation; qi is the cause of generation. Spirit is the root of the heart, and the heart follows intention. The myriad spirits abide in serene numinosity, true qi suffuses all. A thousand origins converge as one, together guarding the jade radiance. Yin’s po undergoes vast transformation; yang’s hun holds fast to life. Nine changes and ten unions link the golden towers. Water becomes the Great One, its form like a lotus in bloom. The great spirit of transformation, jade-fair and refined, extends in purity. Within the nine qi of the great void lies a jade abyss, its profound depths receiving all images. The stars and constellations course within, the Crimson Clarity unfolds its chart, and the workings of nature come full circle. The Winnowing Basket revolves, the Dipper traces its path, and true qi ascends to the Upper Origin. The Eight Effulgences merge in darkness, vanishing into the Mysterious Spring. The Mysterious is the mother of spirit, yin commands the yang officials. Being and non-being nurture growth; movement and stillness range from vast to minute. Through adversity, harmony is restored; earth unites with heaven. The left is entrusted to the right, the last reaches the first. The mechanism of the supreme Dao lies beyond all barriers in the great void. The True One equals emptiness, the freshness of transformation unfolds. Transformation reaches its limit and changes; change reaches its limit and becomes mysterious. Within the mysterious abides the True Sovereign, united in the Great Harmony. The myriad qi align as one, the gate of white clouds. Qi flows like a spring, nourishing the primal source. Vast and profoundly mysterious!\n\n---\n\n**The Wondrous Chapter on the Three Flowers’ Beginning, Embryo Protection, and Life Preservation (III)**\n\nBefore heaven and earth came to be, primordial qi commenced its unfolding. For ninety billion kalpas, the three qi intermingled. After ninety great kalpas, the Three Flowers first divided. The Five Elders repaired the embryo, the Three Origins nurtured the hun. The Dao’s workings through spirit-transformation naturally perfected the true. The Great Dark divided and divided again, the great Dao lay hidden within. In an instant, it responded and transformed, giving rise to spirit and essence. Spirit is the numen of things; through it, the primal chaos was accomplished. Inner and outer harmonized, the two images settled in purity. White was entrusted to red, yin and yang merged; red was entrusted to black, and the embryo congealed. Within lay the Great Void, luminous with the Three Clarities. The spirit-void towered in majesty, primordial qi shone brightly. Within dwelt the numinous youth, emerging from the mysterious and entering the azure. The purple womb loosened its sash, revealing the true form in radiant clarity. The immortal and mysterious shed its fetal husk, giving birth to the divine hero. Its majesty and deportment transformed in unison, vanishing into profound obscurity. Within the obscure abides the essence, the spirit of utmost truth. There is a spirit that can illumine, a spirit that can brighten, a spirit that can establish, a spirit that can generate, a spirit that can flourish, a spirit that can purify. It establishes all beings and things, the wondrous court of the Three Flowers. Within the purple pavilion and vermilion palace, the fetal light shines with numinous clarity, concealed within the jade root. Subtle and serene, within it lies the embryo’s protector—the Lord of the Fire of Shu. Within it lies the transforming infant—the Spirit of Hetu. Within it lies the male overseer—the Lord of Bohua. Within it lies the cloud chamber—the true one of the courtyard. The male calls out, \"Mengfei\"; the female calls out, \"Ziyi.\" The primordial embryo is refined and perfected, a hundred blessings come in peace. Preserving its purity, it attains the true—without thought, the primordial act.\n\n---\n\n**The Wondrous Chapter on the Generation of Heaven and Earth and the Separation and Union of the Two Modes (IV)**\n\nAt the Great Beginning’s first arising, within the true and obscure, no thing had yet taken form. Purple clouds came to welcome it; the round transformation returned to the true. The Yellow Person descended in numinosity, the Primal Elder held the talisman, and the Three Realms dawned in clarity. Heaven was purified, earth was pacified, pure yang came to be. Its majesty and spirit were numinous, and the myriad things were accomplished. The qi of Fan billowed to the left, the radiance of Mi suffused the right. Heaven draped its resplendent hues, earth surged with jade radiance. Qian and Kun stilled in silence, penetrating wisdom and clarity. The luminous effulgence manifested in brightness, the vermilion armor and yang banners. The Tail and Triaster stars stood guard in front, nurturing the hun and benefiting the true. Flying breaths and drawn zithers, delighting in the Dao as companions. The nine heavens and eight poles, great kalpas intersecting in cycles. The primordial mandate was established, distributed across the nine mounds. The Great Beginning culminated in the Nine Yangs, the Great Simplicity culminated in the Six Yins. Transforming to align with the true, its unfolding brought no sorrow. To the left, the Yellow Youth was summoned; to the right, the Earth Spirit was welcomed. Yang’s vigor and yin’s brilliance, primordial essence transformed into one. The two modes ascended and descended, harmonizing naturally. The four seasons followed virtue, nurturing and forgetting transgressions. The hundred spirits coordinated transformation, the myriad things flourished in abundance. Customs were pure and generous, the wondrous chapters were revered. The five phases moved in prosperity, their essence true and constant. They could be obscure or luminous, present or absent. Knowing and practicing this, one drives away yin and employs yang. Externally, glory expands its pattern; internally, one guards the celestial mystery. Forgetting mechanisms both inner and outer, one accords with the true canon. The Primal Sovereign of the Great Ultimate, the subtle and mysterious Dao. The August Emperor held the key, opening the gates of heaven. The golden true shone in luster, its echoes like cloud-borne simurghs. The jade tones gathered qi, numinous winds amassed mist. Purple mushrooms nurtured excellence, giving rise to fetal immortals.\n\n---\n\n**The Wondrous Chapter on the Five Phases’ Completion and the Realm of Longevity for Living Beings (V)**\n\nWhen heaven and earth first divided, the great Dao’s essential subtlety unfolded. The Three Powers operated, the five phases held numinous essence. The qi of the celestial circuit—six periods complete its great accomplishment. The end of the earth’s era—five years complete its minor accomplishment. The five phases flourished in abundance, auspicious qi settled in equilibrium. People suffered no premature death, fulfilling their heavenly years. Thus was good fortune and prosperity achieved. The correct gong and zheng tones became the Great One; the lesser gong and zheng tones became the Great Simplicity. When the five phases are balanced, yin and yang do not clash. When yang’s methods are applied in sequence, longevity and immortality are attained. When primordial transformation is lush and fragrant, life and death enter and exit, feather-transformation achieves immortality, silently harmonizing with the Dao’s essence. The crystals of the five stars descended in numinous form. With qi’s workings complete, the supreme Dao ascends. The movement of the five qi repairs deficiencies and balances ascent. It continues the era and extends years, its workings reaching the source of transformation. Knowing the mechanism of life, one grasps the root of the Dao. When the five phases prosper, their number culminates in nine. Nine transforms into one, one transforms into nine. Nurturing to become one, without excess or deficiency. Metal and wood engender one another; water and fire achieve balance. One qi fills all, wisdom’s nature arises from the source. Harmonizing the four images, after nine years one ascends to the true. Emerging from darkness and entering quiescence, nurturing and generating life. The five qi settle in peace, eternally preserving ascendant harmony. The high heavens are limpid and clear, the great earth is secure and flourishing. With hearts turned toward the utmost true, all attain the immortal isles. The living and the dead receive blessings, ten cycles deliver humanity. The Great Clarity is vast and boundless, its wondrous pattern misty and suffused. United in a single radiance, it illuminates the profound root of the mysterious. The spirit-one floats in effulgence, the Great Flower gives forth sound. The Three Mysteries descend in submission, possessing qi and possessing form. Auspicious signs generate blessings, yin returns to yang’s brightness. The Great Simplicity and the Orthodox One open the chart of life’s deliverance. The Most High shines in glory, universally bestowing celestial grace. Azure tablets inscribed with phoenix-script, cinnabar scrolls written in dragon-characters. Towering and majestic, the Mysterious Capital; misty and grand, the cloud-borne chariots. The wondrous realm of the Supreme Tenuity, the dwelling of the true sages.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Six: The Wondrous Transformations of Spirit and Qi, Boundless and Inexhaustible**\n\nSpirit transforms without end, qi transforms to the primordial extreme. Knowing the Dao is manifest; the Orthodox One’s spirit and qi attain their wondrous use. Kan and Li unite in harmony, yin and yang achieve balance. The spirit does not leave the body, true qi flourishes within. The spirit does not depart the form, ensuring longevity and enduring vision. Within, it circulates through numinous realms; without, it emerges from the dust-sealed gate. Qi transforms in equal measure, roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital. Spirit and qi guard each other, congealing to form the infant. The inner landscape is serene, the Golden Pond and Jade Nourishment harmonized. The spirit’s awareness transcends, a single qi ascends as one. The spirit becomes the Nine Perfected, qi transforms through the Nine Palaces. Pristine and unadorned, the Great Simplicity shines with the wondrous root. Attaining the primordial work, the spirit is supremely wondrous, the true is supremely numinous. Grasping the One, the myriad qi align; heaven is clear, earth is tranquil. This is the mechanism of the Dao, the birth of the Dao. In myriad wondrous courts, the true realm gleams resplendent. Mother and child rejoice in reunion, ascending to appear before the Three Clarities. The yang spirit becomes heaven, the yin qi becomes the spring. The Great Ultimate is without color, the Great Beginning conceals its explanation. Vast and obscure, heaven and earth are profoundly still. Without form or name, the ten thousand images arise. Standing alone in the great void, it blends with the myriad spirits. Its transformations are boundless, giving birth to the ten thousand existences. Grasping the primordial chaos, it traverses the vast immortal palaces. At first, the spring breeze is seen, bright and self-responsive. This is called the Supreme Spirit. The immortals of the Three Realms, the cloud peaks of all heavens—spirit transforms and circulates everywhere, all through the Dao’s presence. This Dao is secret and profound; only by attaining it is one truly real.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: Merging Life and Death, Refining Qi to Transform into Immortals**\n\nRefining qi to transform into immortals is the supreme wondrous Dao. Recognizing the Dao, words vanish; the Great Clarity is supremely luminous. Qi is soft, qi is firm; qi is square, qi is round. Qi surges, qi penetrates; qi is fresh, qi flourishes. Speech is the flower of primal harmony; the mouth utters no evil sounds. With qi, one harmonizes with the Dao; with the Dao, one harmonizes with the true. The hundred spirits gather, auspicious qi stretches endlessly. The five viscera and six bowels emerge from nonbeing into being. Profound beyond profundity, it endures eternally. Qi transforms into spirit, the Five Elders attend in guard. The Three Origins revolve, sweeping away the nine impurities. When qi reaches its extreme, it communicates with the primordial. The Great Perfected’s wondrous pattern: my qi is not a thing, yet it can generate all things. My qi is without emotion, yet it can transform the emotional. Qi is the mother of the Dao, qi is the great spirit. In movement, it becomes being; in stillness, it becomes the mysterious. The ten thousand things’ creation, the wise and foolish, the worthy and dull—all officials, high and low, are nurtured by the Dao. Responding to the season, the embryonic immortal forms; the great creation takes shape. As qi is sensed, its wondrous transmission follows. Whether absent or present, the Rainbow Capital and Jasper Pond, the Sunlit Nectar Abyss—nurturing and aiding transformation, auspicious hues hang high. The spirit roams in tranquil realms, delighting in the Dao’s immortal source.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight: Water and Fire Ascend to Attain Longevity and Enduring Vision**\n\nThe Dao’s root is profoundly mysterious, born yet not perishing, enduring vision without decline. Yet it has no shrine. It illumines the Three Realms, flowing through life and death. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped—is this called the limit? The limitless, the boundless! Discussing its utmost subtlety, it cannot be deceived. Attaining its beneficial use, it irrigates the celestial pond, nurturing and aiding all without omission. Lighting a lamp beneath the water, reversing the course—returning from old age to infancy, only the adept gallops alone. The clumsy in nurturing, the wise find it hard to fathom. Overflowing and drowning, the supreme sage extends compassion, saving those in peril, delivering them from danger. Skilled in application, wondrously activating the mysterious mechanism: on yin days, fire is added. The Five Agents remain unharmed; fire’s concealment deepens, yet it cannot be diminished. The fire of utmost truth shines brilliantly along the celestial path. When it flashes like lightning, its light reaches the Nine Heavens. The supremely good bestow blessings without partiality. When the body encounters the kalpa fire, a lotus blooms within the flames. Guarding stillness against haste, how could it contend with things? Yang fears yin’s interference, harming the numinous explanation. Attaining this utmost profundity, nurturing reaches equal measure. The deluded multiply confusion, burning harmony and destroying peace—like moths rushing to flame, never turning back. The Celestial Thearch pities and heals the decayed; not one in ten thousand is lost. Perceiving the wondrous mystery, fire is added in yang times—longevity arises naturally. Knowing these two, one conceals essence within, silently observing the yang heavens. Within the realm of no life or death, the true realm appears of itself. The Dao unites with spirit, manifesting and communicating the mysterious. The Dao’s root is nonaction, the Dao’s root is ever-fresh. Reviving the bones from death, qi restores the primordial. Heaven’s light enters the body, enduring through eternal mystery.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine: Transcending Death and Birth, Proving the Mortal to Become a Sage**\n\nThe wondrous Dao is subtly mysterious, able to escape life and death. It does not enter the flowing waves, does not dwell in dazzling scenes. It is not stained by worldly splendor, not entangled in fame or profit. It does not pursue greed, does not arise in hatred or love. It does not generate deluded thoughts, does not produce contemplative念. Cutting off the gate of death, it opens the gate of life. The Great One communicates with the numinous; the Five Agents’ qi gathers. The Four Images arise together, the Yellow Court’s Great Thearch. The true realm is pure and clear, the Primordial True Treasure. It pours upon the crown, filling to abundance. Floating and sinking, rising and falling, it eternally preserves integrity. The hundred demons are bound and subdued, the myriad spirits shrink away. In stillness and silence, ever tranquil, the hundred spirits follow in attendance. The celestial stems and branches of the Zhou Tian cycle are carefully examined with utmost sincerity. The Northern Mansion erases records, the Southern Tablet marks names. In the left hand, a golden tablet; in the right, a jade scepter. Phoenixes and cranes, heavenly immortals, come and go in ascent. Form and spirit are tranquil, vast and boundless, luminous and bright. The utmost Dao is eternally firm; the three hun-souls manifest their numinosity. Kan and Li harmonize, nurturing the immortal embryo. Proving the mortal to ascend as a sage.\n\n---\n\nThe Perfected of Penetrating the Mysterious bows in reverence and gives thanks: Your servants are deeply grateful for your compassionate grace, illuminating and bestowing the true teachings. The assembled perfected pay homage; the nation is prosperous, the people are abundant. Fengdu is tranquil and silent; the Three Realms rejoice.\n\nThe Perfected of Penetrating the Mysterious addresses the assembled sages: Today, we are fortunate to receive the master’s transmission. Each of us reverently upholds it, reciting the true scripture. Its merit is inexhaustible. If one encounters the Jade Flower’s numinous text and wishes to recite it, one should first purify the heart and calm the mind, fast and bathe, burn incense, and pay homage to the ten directions, each three times. Then, facing east, sit evenly, gather the spirit, and settle the will. Reciting the scripture once averts misfortune. Reciting it ten times, all evil returns to rectitude. Reciting it a hundred times, spirits and ghosts submit. Reciting it a thousand times, one attains long life. Reciting it ten thousand times, one ascends nine generations above and shades seven below, ultimately proving one’s own body, eternally becoming a denizen of the celestial palace. In this world, do not forget—believe, accept, and practice.",

      "translated_text": "The *Exalted Jade Flower Grotto Scripture for Delivering the Deceased, Transcending the World, and Ascending as an Immortal* concludes.\n\nAn Account of the Scripture’s Transmission\n\nThe Tianning Wanshou Abbey in Fenzhou was originally the Kaiyuan Abbey of the Tang, the dwelling place of Adept Yan. The adept expounded utmost virtue and propagated the mysterious Daoist teachings, a rare master of the Dao. To this day, over four hundred years later, the Tang and Song inscriptions and odes by Zhao and Yan remain carved in stone, available for examination.\n\nAfter the ravages of war, the ranks of Daoist clergy had dwindled. In the winter of the second year of the Huangtong era, the Daoist community gathered and sighed, saying: *\"Shall we not feel shame before the former adept?\"* They had recently heard of a certain Du Changchun in the western outskirts of Xiaoyi—a youth not yet come of age—who, while herding sheep, had encountered an immortal perfected one. In a single evening, he suddenly attained awakening, as one awakens from a dream or sobers from drunkenness. He discoursed on the subtle and profound, instructed through poetry and verse, and his calligraphy flowed like dragons and serpents. Moreover, he wrote talismans and chanted incantations over water to cure illnesses. Far and near, those who heard of his reputation were delighted and wished to invite him to reside in their abbey to propagate the teachings, thereby glorifying the former master and reviving the Daoist tradition. Would this not be fitting?\n\nThe Daoist community rejoiced, and together with those who revered the Dao, they constructed an abbey behind the main hall, extending corridors and planting pines and bamboo. They then journeyed to Xiaoyi to invite Changchun to reside in the abbey and propagate the teachings.\n\nThe following year, on the Lantern Festival, a grand offering was held, attended by nearly a thousand people. One leisurely day, Du Changchun addressed the Daoist community, saying: *\"I possess a scroll of an Exalted Perfected Scripture that has not yet circulated in the world. Today, I wish to transmit it to you. When recited, this scripture dispels heavenly calamities above, verifies the self within, and averts ghostly misfortunes below. It delivers from suffering, absolves transgressions, and grants longevity and enduring vision—such is the essence of cultivating the true Dao and attaining the Way.\"*\n\nThe Daoist community was overjoyed and eager to hear the details. On the True Origin Festival in the second month, an offering was prepared to request the scripture, and they pledged to receive and practice it faithfully. By the Shangsi Festival in the third month, an offering was held to transmit a scroll of the scripture, titled *The Exalted Jade Flower Grotto Scripture for Delivering the Deceased, Transcending the World, and Ascending as an Immortal*. Inscribed on silk, it comprised over three thousand characters in nine chapters, followed by the perfected one’s numinous talismans and divine incantations at the end of the scroll.\n\nOn that day, fragrant flowers gathered in abundance. The scripture was borne in procession to the Hall of Great Empyrean before the sacred thrones of the Three Clarities. The assembly read it aloud as the crowd knelt in reverence, receiving it upon their crowns. None failed to vow to recite it for the rest of their lives. Woodblocks were then carved, and prints were made into scrolls, distributed widely among those who revered the Dao, thereby broadening its transmission.",
