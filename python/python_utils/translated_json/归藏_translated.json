  "full_translation": "From the *Yuhan Shanfang Collection of Lost Books*, edited by Ma Guohan of the Qing Dynasty:\n\n**Ma’s Preface:**\nThe *Guicang* comprises one fascicle, now fragmentary and incomplete.\n\nThe *Rites of Zhou*, \"Spring Offices, Grand Diviner,\" states: \"He oversees the methods of the Three Changes—first, the *Lianshan*; second, the *Guicang*; third, the *Zhouyi*.\" Zheng Xuan annotates: \"The *Guicang* means that the myriad things all return and are stored within.\" Du Zichun says: \"The *Lianshan* belongs to Fuxi; the *Guicang*, to the Yellow Emperor.\" Jia Gongyan’s subcommentary cites Zheng’s *Responses to Zhao Shang*: \"Though no explicit text confirms this, altering it lacks basis; thus, we follow Zichun.\" Later masters generally regard them as the Xia and Shang [versions of the *Yi*].\n\nThe *Record of Rites*, \"Evolution of Rites,\" records Confucius as saying: \"I wished to observe the Way of the Shang, so I went to Song. Though evidence was insufficient, I obtained *Kun* and *Qian* there.\" Zheng’s annotation states: \"The Shang’s book on yin and yang that survives is the *Guicang*,\" thus also identifying the *Guicang* as the Shang *Yi*.\n\nThe *Han History*, \"Treatise on Arts and Letters,\" does not record it. The Jin *Central Catalog* first includes it. Ruan Xiaoxu’s *Seven Records* states: \"The *Guicang* is a miscellaneous work on divination and various matters.\" The *History of the Sui*, \"Treatise on Classics and Books,\" lists thirteen fascicles, with commentary by Xue Zhen, a military aide to the Grand Commandant of Jin. The *Tang History*, \"Treatise on Arts and Letters,\" records the same number of fascicles. The Song *Revival Book Catalog* includes three chapters: *Initial Canon*, *Mother of Qi*, and *Root of the Milfoil*. Many scholars, considering it a later fabrication, cast doubt on its authenticity. Zheng Qiao’s *Comprehensive Treatises* argues: \"It speaks of divination; its language is plain, its meaning ancient. Later scholars, finding it unrefined, suspect and discard it—yet do they not know that later generations could compose such texts?\" Yang Shen also notes: \"The *Lianshan* was stored in the Orchid Terrace; the *Guicang*, in the Grand Diviner’s archives,\" as seen in Huan Tan’s *New Discourses*. Thus, in the Later Han, both the *Lianshan* and *Guicang* still existed. One cannot dismiss them merely because the *Treatise on Arts and Letters* omits them. Examining its surviving hexagrams, such as:\n\n*\"Ju: There is a *ju*; there is a *gu*. Millet is brewed into wine, poured into twin flasks. Two ewes drink it; after three days, they become drunk. The knight has marshland—I take its fish.\"*\n\n*\"The good man obtains his jade; the noble man obtains his grain.\"*\n\n*\"There are wild ducks and mandarin ducks; there are geese and egrets.\"*\n\nAll employ rhymed verses, archaic and recitable, akin to the oracle phrases recorded in the *Zuo Tradition*. The *Forest of Hexagrams* by Jiao Yanshou derives from this. Though lines like \"the sun is exhausted\" or \"the moon flees\" verge on the fantastical, even the great *Yi* draws imagery from \"dragons battling in the wild\" or \"a cartload of ghosts\"—nothing to discredit it. However, as a Shang *Yi*, it records \"King Wu’s secret divination\" and \"King Mu’s hexagram casting.\" Likely, the Zhou Grand Diviners, who preserved its methods, appended records of divinations and verifications to its chapters. Such texts could not have been composed by men of the Han or later.\n\nToday, even the three Song chapters are lost. Zhu Xi’s *Investigation of Classical Meaning* compiles it in great detail, serving as the basis for this edition. Where omissions remain, I have supplemented and stitched them together, appending various scholars’ discussions into one fascicle. Comparing this with the so-called *Qi Tomb Guicang* in the transmitted *Three Tombs*, authenticity and forgery can be immediately discerned.\n\nBy Ma Guohan of Licheng, styled Zhuwufu.\n\n---\n\n**Guicang**\n\n**Guicang: Initial Canon**\nZhu Zhen’s *Han River Yi* states: \"The *Yi* of the *Guicang*—its *Initial Canon*—embodies the original intent of Fuxi.\"\n\n**Initial Qian**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation* and Zhu Zhen’s *Collected Discourses on the Yi* both record its contention.\n\nLi Guo’s *Western Stream Yi Discourses* and Hu Yigui’s *Wings of Enlightenment on the Zhou Yi*\n\n**Initial Kun**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation*; Zhu Zhen says *Kun*.\n\n*\"The blossoms of glory.\"*\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment on the Zhou Yi*; Zhu’s *Investigation of Classical Meaning* cites it as \"glorious glory.\"\n\n**Initial Gen**\nGan Bao and Zhu Zhen both cite it as *Gen*. Li Guo’s *Western Stream Yi Discourses* and Huang Zongyan’s *Images and Words of the Zhou Yi* cite it as *Hen*. Huang explains: \"*Gen* is *hen* (fierce). *Gen* has the image of turning inward, silent and unsmiling, its countenance stern—thus taking its meaning from rigidity and fierceness?\"\n\n*\"The fox barks sharply.\"*\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*.\n\n**Initial Dui**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation* and Zhu Zhen’s *Collected Discourses on the Yi* record its speech as sincere.\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*\n\n**Initial Li**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation*; Zhu Zhen says *Kan*. Li Guo states: \"To call *Kan* *luo* (toil): *luo* means labor. It signifies the myriad things laboring within *Kan*.\" Huang Zongyan says: \"*Kan* is the hexagram of toil, hence derived from *lao* (labor) by phonetic loan and abbreviation. Nothing toils more than the ox, thus the character includes 'ox.'\"\n\n*\"For celebration, the body does not move.\"*\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*.\n\n**Initial Li**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation* and Zhu Zhen’s *Collected Discourses on the Yi*.\n\n*\"Li gazes intently.\"*\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*\n\n**Initial Zhen**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation*; Zhu Zhen says *Zhen*. Li Guo states: \"*Zhen* is *li* (order). *Li* means principle. As the Supreme emerges from *Zhen*, it is the beginning of the myriad things’ orderly patterns.\" Huang Zongyan says: \"*Zhen* is *li*. *Li* should correspond to *Li* (Fire), but *Zhen* (Thunder) is not close—could it be that thunder orders the earth to emerge and resound?\"\n\n*\"Like the rumbling of thunder.\"*\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*.\n\n**Initial Xun**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation* and Zhu Zhen’s *Collected Discourses on the Yi*: *\"A bird is about to arrive and lowers its wings.\"*\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*.\n\nAll hexagrams consist of six lines, as recorded in *Collected Discourses on the Yi*.\n\nWang Yinglin’s *Han Arts and Literature Annals Considerations*, Volume One.\nZhu Yuansheng’s *Comprehensive Study of the Three Yi* states: *\"The* Guicang Yi *takes pure* Kun *as its first hexagram. Kun *represents Earth, within which all things are stored. The* Shuogua *says: ‘Kun *conceals them.’ This is the true mechanism of creation and nurturance, ever concealed within it. Yet each* yuan *has its own creative process—at the cusp of* guihai *and* jiazi *lies its concealment; each year has its own creative process—at the solstices of winter and summer lies its concealment; each day has its own creative process—at the juncture of midnight and noon lies its concealment. Thus, the* Guicang Yi *nowhere fails to employ its principle of concealment. Of the sixty-four hexagrams, sixteen are for concealment, and forty-eight for application. Qian *is the father of the sixty-four hexagrams, and* Kun *their mother. Kun *governs the hexagrams of concealment, while* Qian *governs those of application. Thus,* Kun *and* Qian *head the sixty-four hexagrams. Where there is concealment, there must be application; hence, pure* Kun *precedes even pure* Qian.*\"*\n\nXu Shan’s *Four Yi* states: *\"The sequence of hexagrams in the* Guicang *is:* Kun, Zhen, Kan, Gen, Dui, Li, Xun, Qian. *This is because* Zhen *emerges with one yang born beneath pure* Kun. *Thereafter, it advances to* Kan *and centers, then to* Gen *and ascends, meeting at the fifth line to yield* Dui *with its two yangs—yet one yin still remains above. At* Li, *the central yang ascends; at* Xun, *the initial yang enters the center, thus completing the form of pure* Qian. *This is the sequence of yang qi’s gradual growth. Reversing the process:* Xun *begins with one yin born beneath pure* Qian. *It then advances to* Li *and centers, then to* Dui *and ascends, meeting at the fifth line to yield* Gen *with its two yins—yet one yang still remains above. At* Kan, *the central yin ascends; at* Zhen, *the initial yin enters the center, thus completing the form of pure* Kun. *This is the sequence of yin qi’s gradual growth and yang qi’s return to concealment. The name ‘Guicang’ likely derives from this. Numerically, when proceeding from below upward, it begins with eight and ends with two, for yang qi arises from nothing into being—this is the principle of ‘knowing the future in reverse.’ When proceeding from below upward, it begins with two and ends with eight, for yang qi returns from being into nothing—this is the principle of ‘reckoning the past in sequence.’ The sages named it* Guicang *to teach people the Dao of returning to the origin and renewing the beginning.\"*\n\nFollowing the sixty-four hexagrams as recorded in Li Guo’s *Western Stream Yi Discourses*—from *Qian* to *Matu*, totaling sixty hexagrams—four missing hexagrams are here supplemented.\n*Kun*: As cited in *Western Stream Yi Discourses*, with four missing hexagrams filled in according to Jia Gongyan’s *Record of Rites Subcommentary*: *\"This* Guicang Yi *takes* Kun *as its first,\"* based on the *Initial Classic*.\n*Qian*: As in *Western Stream Yi Discourses*, with the same method applied below.\n*Tun*\n*Meng*\n\n\"Ru,\" \"Song,\" \"Shi,\" \"Bi,\" *Xiao Du Xu* (*Western Stream* states: \"Xiao Xu is *Xiao Du Xu*.\") Huang Zongxi says: \"*Da Xu* and *Xiao Xu* are *Da Du Xu* and *Xiao Du Xu*; *du* takes the meaning of nurturing and transforming.\"\n\n\"Lü,\" \"Tai,\" \"Pi,\" \"Tong Ren,\" \"Da You,\" \"Hen,\" \"Xian,\" \"Da Guo,\" \"Yi,\" \"Kun,\" \"Jing,\" \"Ge,\" \"Ding,\" \"Lü,\" \"Feng,\" \"Xiao Guo,\" *Lin Huo* (*Western Stream* states: \"Lin is *Lin Huo*.\")\n\n\"Guan,\" \"Cui,\" *Cheng* (Huang Zongxi says: \"*Sheng* is *Cheng*; the earth gives birth to wood—where soil is thick, trees flourish; where barren, they wither. This speaks of wood and earth being in balance.\")\n\n*Pu* (Huang Zongxi says: \"*Bo* is *Pu*.\")\n\n\"Fu,\" *Mu Wang* (Huang Zongxi says: \"*Wu Wang* is *Mu Wang*; *mu* means ‘without,’ *wang* means ‘delusion’—there is no other meaning.\")\n\n*Da Du Xu* (*Western Stream* states: \"*Da Xu* is *Da Du Xu*.\")\n\n*Qu* (Huang Zongxi says: \"*Qu* should belong to *Guan*.\" Note: *Western Stream* has already cited *Guan*; Zhu Taishi Yizun’s *Jingyi Kao* takes \"opposition\" as its meaning, suggesting *Qu* precedes *San Jia Ren* and thus refers to *Kui*.)\n\n*San Jia Ren* (Huang Zongxi says: \"*Jia Ren* is *San Jia Ren*—its meaning cannot be determined.)\n\n\"Jie\"\n\n\"Huan\" (Huang Zongyan says: \"*Huan* is *Luan*; in ancient script, characters might either include or omit radicals, leading to mutual interchange.\")\n\n*Jian*\n\n*Li* (Huang Zongyan says: \"*Jie* is *Li*; *li* also carries the meaning of gathering and dispersing.\")\n\n*Yuan* (Huang Zongyan says: \"*Sun* is *Yuan*.\")\n\n*Xian* (Huang Zongyan says: \"*Xian* is *Xian*.\" Zhu Taishi says: \"Taking *Sun* as *Yuan* and placing *Xian* after it, then *Xian* signifies *Yi*.\")\n\n*Qin* (Huang Zongyan says: \"*Qin* should belong to *Lǚ*.\" Zhu Taishi says: \"Since *Qin* precedes *Heng*, it is *Xian*.\")\n\n*Heng*\n\n*Gui*\n\n*Ye* (Huang Zongyan says: \"*Gui* should belong to *Jie*, and *Ye* to *Mingyi*.\" Note: *Western Stream* has already cited *Jie* and *Mingyi*. Zhu Taishi says: \"The two names *Gui* and *Ye* cannot be definitively assigned to which hexagrams; if not *Guai* and *Gou*, then they must be *Shihe* and *Bi*.\" Note: In antiquity, contracts were derived from *Guai*, which aligns closely with the meaning of *Gui*; *Ye* carries the sense of *Gou*’s \"encounter\" and \"taking a wife,\" so it is likely that *Gui* belongs to *Guai* and *Ye* to *Gou*.)\n\n*Xun*\n\n*Dui*\n\n**Li**\n\n*Luò* (Huang Zongyan says: \"*Luò* should belong to *Qiān*.\")\n\n*Jiān* (Huang Zongyan says: \"*Jiān* is *Qiān*.\")\n*Fēn* (Huang Zongyan says: \"*Fēn* should belong to *Kuí*.\" Zhu Taishi says: \"Taking *Qiān* as *Jiān* and placing *Fēn* after it, then *Fēn* signifies *Yù*.\")\n\n*Guīmèi*\n*Jiàn*\n*Jìn*\n*Míngyí*\n\n*Cénjì* (Huang Zongyan says: \"*Cénjì* should belong to *Bì*.\" Zhu Taishi says: \"Since *Cénjì* precedes *Wèijì*, it is *Jìjì*.\")\n\n*Wèijì* ◎ (upper *tuàn*, lower *chuò*) (Huang Zongyan says: \"◎ is *Dùn*; its form and meaning are inherently connected, with no alternative interpretation.\")\n\n*Shǔ* (Huang Zongyan says: \"*Gǔ* is *Shǔ*, for *Shǔ* is also an insect.\")\n*Mǎtú* (Zhu Taishi says: \"Taking *Gǔ* as *Shǔ* and placing *Mǎtú* after it, then *Mǎtú* is *Suí*.\")\n\nThe above sixty hexagrams are all cited from *Xīxī’s Exposition of the Yì*, with the *Shì* hexagram supplemented from the *Chūjīng*.\n\n*Yínghuò*\n*Qílǎo*\n*Dàmíng* (Luo Ping’s *Lùshǐ Zhù* states: \"The hexagrams of the *Guīcáng Chūjīng* all have six positions, including names such as *Míngyí*, *Yínghuò*, *Qílǎo*, and *Dàmíng*. In ancient times, Qi of Xià divined *Míngyí*; Gǔn, in managing the waters, cast lots with *Dàmíng*; Jié divined *Yínghuò*; and King Wǔ, in his campaign against Shāng, cast lots with *Qílǎo*.\" Note: *Míngyí* cited in *Xīxī* is the same *Míngyí*. Below *Qián*, the *Shì* hexagram should be added, as supplemented from *Gān Bǎo* and *Zhū Zhèn*’s citations of the *Chūjīng*. Together with *Yínghuò*, *Qílǎo*, and *Dàmíng*, they precisely complete the sixty-four hexagrams. Following the interpretations of Messrs. Huang and Zhu, only *Shìkè*, *Bì*, and *Zhōngfú* remain unassigned; their affiliations are appended here.)\n\nZhu Yuansheng’s *Sānyì Bèikǎo* states: \"The *Guīcáng Yì* pairs the sixty-four hexagrams with the sixty *jiǎ* stems, storing the *qi* of the Five Phases and employing the domains of the Five Phases.\"\nHe also says: \"The *Guīcáng Yì* begins with *Kūn* and ends with *Bō*.\"\nFurther: \"The two sections of the *Guīcáng* span from *jiǎzǐ* to *guǐsì* as the *Former Jiǎ*, and from *jiǎwǔ* to *guǐhài* as the *Latter Jiǎ*, totaling ten thousand and eight hundred *cè*.\"\n\n**The Twelve Sovereign Hexagrams**\n*Zǐ*: *Fù*\n*Chǒu*: *Lín*\n*Yín*: *Tài*\n*Mǎo*: *Dàzhuàng*\n*Chén*: *Guài*\n*Sì*: *Qián*\n*Wǔ*: *Gòu* (Zhu Taishi says: \"The original text of the *Guīcáng* writes this as ◎ (upper *tuàn*, lower *chuò*).\")\n*Wèi*: *Dùn*\n*Shēn*: *Pǐ*\n*Yǒu*: *Guān*\n*Xū*: *Bō* (Zhu Taishi says: \"The original text of the *Guīcáng* writes this as *Pū*.\")\n*Hài*: *Kūn* (from Xu Shan’s *Sìyì*)\n\nXu Shan says: \"These are the twelve sovereign hexagrams of the *Guīcáng*, known as the *Shāng* method of divination. *Sovereign* refers to the ruler. The method is as follows: First, set a six-line *Kūn* hexagram, then sequentially transform it with six yang lines to form the five sovereign hexagrams *Fù*, *Lín*, *Tài*, *Dàzhuàng*, and *Guài*. Next, set a six-line *Qián* hexagram and sequentially transform it with six yin lines to form the five sovereign hexagrams *Gòu*, *Dùn*, *Pǐ*, *Guān*, and *Bō*. With these ten sovereign hexagrams established, the framework is complete. Then, set another six-line *Kūn* hexagram and transform it with the *Fù* sovereign to produce six hexagrams with one yang line; with the *Lín* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with two yang lines; with the *Tài* sovereign, twenty hexagrams with three yang lines; with the *Dàzhuàng* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with four yang lines; and with the *Guài* sovereign, six hexagrams with five yang lines. Proceeding further to pure *Qián*, the sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams is thus determined. Examining this process, the six positions of *Qián* have already become newly transformed lines, while the six positions of *Kūn* remain as the original untransformed lines—just as the yang lines in a hexagram have changed while the yin lines remain unchanged. Then, set the newly formed *Qián* hexagram and transform it with the *Gòu* sovereign to produce six hexagrams with one yin line; with the *Dùn* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with two yin lines; with the *Pǐ* sovereign, twenty hexagrams with three yin lines; with the *Guān* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with four yin lines; and with the *Bō* sovereign, six hexagrams with five yin lines. Proceeding further to the six positions of pure *Kūn*, the transformation is complete. Ultimately, there is no dual arrangement—only these sixty-four positions. Proceeding sequentially, through seven transformations of *Kūn*, one obtains one hundred ninety-two yang lines, revealing the body of pure *Kūn*. Reversing the process, through seven transformations of *Qián*, one obtains one hundred ninety-one yin lines, again revealing the body of pure *Kūn*. One inversion and one reversal complete the three hundred eighty-four lines of the *Yì*.\"\n\n**Guīcáng Qímǔjīng**\nThe meaning of \"*Qímǔ*\" is unclear. According to the *Guīcáng*, which takes *Kūn* as its beginning, *Kūn* is the mother of all things. Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shānhǎi Jīng* also cites the *Zhèngmǔjīng*, suggesting that the twelve sovereign hexagrams may correspond to the twelve terrestrial branches, though this is uncertain.\n\n*Qú*: There is *qú* and *gū*; millet is brewed into wine, offered in two vessels, and two ewes drink from them. After three days, they revive.\n\"A knight has a marsh; I take its fish.\"\n(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Ěryǎ*, under \"Sheep\" in the \"Beasts\" section, cites the *Guīcáng*: \"two vessels, two ewes.\" Xing Bing’s annotation states: \"This is the line text of the *Qú* hexagram from the *Guīcáng Qímǔjīng*.\" However, upon examining the passage, it appears Xing Bing’s attribution may be incorrect. The *Xīxī Yìshuō* cites the *Guīcáng* as including a hexagram named *Qú*, and this is its line text.)\n\n**Guīcáng Zhèngmǔjīng**\n*Míngyí* states: In ancient times, Qǐ of Xià divined: \"Riding a flying dragon to ascend to heaven,\" and cast lots with Gāoyáo, who said: \"Auspicious.\"\n(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shānhǎi Jīng* cites the *Guīcáng Zhèngmǔjīng*: \"Qǐ of Xià divined riding a flying dragon to ascend to heaven; it was auspicious.\")\n\n**Collation Notes:**\nZhang Hua’s *Bówùzhì* (vol. 9, \"Miscellaneous Sayings I\") cites the passage beginning with \"Míngyí states: In ancient times\" and the twelve characters \"而枚占于皋陶陶曰,\" with \"御\" written as \"乘\" and an additional \"而\" after \"龙.\" The *Taiping Yùlǎn* (vol. 929) quotes the *Guīcáng*: \"In ancient times, Qǐ of Xià ascended as a flying dragon to reach heaven; Gāoyáo divined it and said, 'Auspicious.'\" Though the wording differs slightly, it is essentially a remnant of this passage and is thus supplemented here.\n\nIn ancient times, Xià Qǐ divined the relocation of the Nine Tripods, and indeed he moved them.\n(The *Bówùzhì* (vol. 9, \"Miscellaneous Sayings I\") cites this alongside the previous passage as a single section, followed by four additional entries, likely forming one continuous text; thus, it is appended here.)\n\nIn ancient times, Shùn divined his ascent to heaven to become a spirit; the divination by lot involved the Yellow Dragon Spirit, who said: \"Inauspicious.\"\n(Ibid.)\n\nKing Wǔ divined the campaign against Zhòu; the divination by lot involved the elders, who said: \"Auspicious.\"\n(Ibid.)\n\nIn ancient times, Gǔn divined the damming of the floodwaters; the divination by lot involved Dàmíng, who said: \"Inauspicious. There will be a beginning but no end.\"\n(Ibid.)\n\nIn ancient times, Jié divined the campaign against Táng; the divination by lot involved Yínghuò, who said: \"Inauspicious. It is unfavorable to march forth; only in remaining at rest is there advantage. They are the fox; we are the rat. Do not undertake action, lest you harm your father.\"\n(The *Taiping Yùlǎn* (vol. 82) quotes the *Guīcáng*: \"In ancient times, Jié divined the campaign against Táng; the divination by lot involved Yínghuò, who said: 'Inauspicious. It is unfavorable to march forth; only in remaining at rest is there advantage. They are the fox; [we are] the rat.'\" The two characters \"为我\" are omitted. The *Taiping Yùlǎn* (vol. 912) also quotes: \"In ancient times, Jié divined the campaign against Táng; the divination by lot involved Yínghuò, who said: 'Inauspicious. They are the fox; we are the rat. Do not undertake action, lest you harm your father.'\" Wáng’s *Hàn Yìwénzhì Kǎo* combines these into one passage, which is followed here. The *Bówùzhì* cites: \"Jié divined the campaign against Táng; the divination by lot involved Yínghuò, who said: 'Inauspicious,'\" omitting the line text, likely an abridgment.)\n\nIn ancient times, Yì was skilled in archery; he shot down the ten suns, and indeed he did so.\n(Guō Pú’s commentary on the *Shānhǎi Jīng* cites the *Guīcáng Zhèngmǔjīng*. The *Shàngshū* (\"Five Sons’ Lament\") *Zhèngyì* and the *Chūnqiū Zuǒzhuàn* (Duke Xiāng 4th year) *Yì* both quote the *Guīcáng*: \"Yì shot down the suns.\")\n\n**Appendix of Lost Line Texts:**\nXú Shàn’s *Sì Yì* states that the *Guīcáng* contains 384 line texts, matching the six lines per hexagram of the *Zhōu Yì*, and thus belongs to the canonical text.

(*Bówù Zhì*)\n\nWhen the tip of the milfoil is larger than its root, it is most auspicious; when the tip of the mugwort is larger than its root, it is next auspicious; when the tip of the thorn is larger than its root, it is next auspicious; when the tip of the arrow-bamboo is larger than its root, it is next auspicious; when the tip of the bamboo is larger than its root, it is next auspicious.\n\nThe milfoil governs one of the five spirits; the mugwort, two of the four spirits; the thorn, two of the three spirits; the arrow-bamboo, four of the two spirits; the bamboo, five of the one spirit.\n\nIn divination, if all five transgressions are concealed, and the five milfoils are cast, the spirits all gather there. (*Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 727, citing *Guī Cáng*; according to *Bówù Zhì*: \"When the milfoil’s tip is larger than its root, it is most auspicious; next the mugwort, then the thorn, all being so\"—this is likely an abbreviated passage. Zhu the Grand Historian’s *Jīngyì Kǎo* states: \"This should belong to the *Original Milfoil* chapter.\" Here, both sources are used for supplementation.)\n\nFor divination, one must bathe, fast, abstain, and consume incense; each day, one gazes toward the milfoil and bathes it—this must be done five times. Bathing the tortoise is the same. (*Bówù Zhì*, juàn 9)\n\n(*Guī Cáng*, *Shǐ Shì* chapter)\n\nGazing upon the heavens above, now bright, now dim.\nThere was Xi He’s child, who emerged from Yang Valley. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*)\n\nGong Gong had a human face, a serpent’s body, and crimson hair. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu; *Lù Shǐ* commentary by Luo Ping, both citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*)\n\nThe child of Li Mountain had green feathers, a human face, and a horse’s body. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*; *Lù Shǐ* commentary by Luo Ping cites the opening line as: “The child of Li Mountain drums.”)\n\nThe Feathered People had the form of birds: beaks, red eyes, and white heads. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*)\n\nThe child of Metal and Water was named Yu Meng. When divined, it was said: “The Feathered People give birth to the hundred birds.” (*Wén Xuǎn*, juàn 13, commentary on Mi Heng’s *Rhapsody on the Parrot*, citing *Guī Cáng Yīn Shì*; *Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 914, cites *Qǐ Shì*, adding four characters: “and then went to the Feathered People.”)\n\nThe surging floodwaters knew no bounds; Bo Gun then used *xi shi* and *xi rang* to dam the deluge. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*)\n\nWhen Gun departed, his body did not decay for three years. When split open with a Wu blade, he transformed into a yellow bear. (Ibid.)\n\nThe great Wu blade of Tai Fu was used to give birth to Yu. (*Chū Xué Jì*, juàn 22)\n\nOf old, the *Nine Darks* shared the same palace sequence as the *Disputation* of the Thearch, and this was called the *Nine Songs*. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*)\n\nOne must not steal the *Disputation* and the *Nine Songs* to rule the world below. (Ibid.)\n\nOf old, Xia Hou Qi offered sacrifices to the spirits at the ruins of Jin, constructing the Xuan Terrace on the sunny side of the waters. (*Wén Xuǎn*, juàn 46, commentary on Wang Rong’s *Preface to the Third Day of the Third Month’s Winding Waters Poetry*; *Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 82, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*; juàn 177 cites it as “the numinous terrace of Jin,” omitting “of old” and “on the sunny side of the waters.”)\n\nOf old, Xia Hou Qi divined and offered sacrifices to the spirits at Da Ling, ascending the Hook Terrace. Gao Yao cast the milfoil and said: “Inauspicious.” (*Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 82; *Chū Xué Jì*, juàn 22, cites up to “Hook Terrace.”)\n\n---\n\nFragments transmitted in various records without identifiable chapter names are appended below.\n\nQian represents Heaven, the ruler, the father, great redness, the sovereign, the minister, the horse, grain, and the hexagram of blood. (Zhu Zhen’s *Yì Cóng Shuō*; Luo Ping’s *Lù Shǐ* commentary)\n\nWhen the Green Thearch arose, green clouds supported the sun; when the Red Thearch arose, yellow clouds supported the moon. (Dong Jun, Yun Zhong. Sima Zhen’s *Shǐ Jì Suǒ Yǐn* states: “Dong Jun and Yun Zhong appear in the *Guī Cáng Yì*.”)\n\nOf old, Nü Wa divined and stretched a cloud canopy. Casting the milfoil, it was said: “Auspicious. Radiant are the nine provinces, as the sun and moon alternate in their courses. Equalizing the land, harmonizing the four states.” (*Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 78; *Hàn Yì Wén Zhì Kǎo*, juàn 1)\n\nOf old, the Yellow Thearch battled the Flame Deity in the wilds of Zhuolu. Before the fight, he divined with Wu Xian, who said: “Fruitful indeed, yet there will be misfortune.” (*Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 79; *Hàn Yì Wén Zhì Kǎo* cites: “The Yellow Thearch, before battle, divined with Wu Xian”; Luo Ping’s *Lù Shǐ* commentary cites: “Of old, the Yellow Deity fought the Flame Thearch at Zhuolu.”)\n\nChi You attacked Kong Sang, the dwelling of the Thearch. (Luo Ping’s *Lù Shǐ* commentary)\n\nChi You emerged from the Yang Waters, with eight arms, eight toes, and a sparse-haired head. He ascended the nine marshes to attack Kong Sang. The Yellow Thearch killed him at Qing Qiu and composed the *Ten Chapters of the Gang Drum*: first, *Thunder’s Shocking Tremor*; second, *Fierce Tiger’s Fright*; third, *Raptor’s Strike*; fourth, *Dragon Steed’s Prance*; fifth, *Spiritual Kui’s Roar*; sixth, *Eagle and Owl’s Strife*; seventh, *Valiant Warrior’s Might*; eighth, *Bear and Grizzly’s Howl*; ninth, *Stone’s Tumbling Cliff*; tenth, *Wave’s Surging Gorge*. (*Chū Xué Jì*, juàn 9, cites from “Chi You” to “Qing Qiu”; Feng Weina’s *Shī Jì* includes the *Ten Chapters of the Gang Drum* and onward.)\n\nOf old, Chang E fled to the moon with the elixir of immortality. (*Wén Xuǎn*, juàn 13, commentary on Xie Huilian’s *Rhapsody on the Moon*; *Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 984; *Hàn Yì Wén Zhì Kǎo* cites: “Of old, Chang E consumed the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West and fled to the moon, becoming the moon’s essence.”)\n\nOf old, the River Earl divined and fought with Luo. Casting the milfoil, Kun Wu divined it as inauspicious.\n\n*The Chū Xué Jì*, juàn 20:\nKing Mu hunted in the wilds of Ge.\n\n*The Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 831, cites *The Shangshu’s Return to the Hidden* (the characters “Shangshu” are erroneous):\nOf old, King Mu’s son divined with milfoil before Yuqiang.\n\n*Zhuāngzǐ Shìwén* and *Hàn Yì Wén Zhì Kǎo*, juàn 1:\nOf old, King Mu of Heaven divined his westward departure by the proper path. The omen was inauspicious, and he said:\n“The dragon descends from heaven, and the road is long and distant.\nSoaring to pierce the sky, its feathers deep and dark.”\n\n*The Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 85.\n\n**Assorted Discourses of Various Masters**\n*The Lǐjì*:\nConfucius said, “I wished to observe the Way of Yin, and so I went to Song, but there was insufficient evidence. What I obtained was *Kun* and *Qian*.”\n\n*The Shānhǎi Jīng*:\nThe Yellow Emperor obtained *The Yellow River Chart*, and the men of Shang followed it, calling it *Return to the Hidden*.\n\n*The Zhōulǐ: Grand Diviner*:\nHe presides over the methods of the Three Changes: first, *Continuous Mountains*; second, *Return to the Hidden*; third, *The Zhou Changes*. Their primary hexagrams are eight, and their derived hexagrams are sixty-four.\n\nDu Zichun said:\n*Return to the Hidden* belongs to the Yellow Emperor.\n\nHuan Tan said:\n*Return to the Hidden* consists of 4,300 words.\nHe also said:\n*Return to the Hidden* was stored in the Grand Diviner’s archives.\n\nZheng Kangcheng said:\nThe Yin book of yin and yang that survives is *Return to the Hidden*.\n\nChunyu Jun said:\n*Return to the Hidden* means that the myriad things all return and are stored within.\n\nRuan Xiaoxu said:\n*Return to the Hidden* contains miscellaneous matters on divination.\n\nLiu Xie said:\nThe classic of *Return to the Hidden* greatly illuminates the strange and wondrous, even recounting Yi’s slaying of the ten suns and Chang E’s flight to the moon.\n\n*The Suíshū*:\n*Return to the Hidden* was already lost. According to the Jin *Central Catalogue*, it existed, but it only recorded divination and did not resemble the intent of the sages.\n\nKong Yingda said:\n*Return to the Hidden* originated with the Yellow Emperor.\nHe also said:\nThe sages adapted to the times and circumstances, not necessarily following one another. Thus, the order of hexagrams in *Return to the Hidden* differs greatly.\nHe also said:\nConfucius said, “I obtained *Kun* and *Qian*.” The Yin *Changes* begins with *Kun*, placing it before *Qian*.\n\nJia Gongyan said:\nThis *Return to the Hidden Changes* begins with pure *Kun*. *Kun* is earth, and the myriad things all return and are stored within it.\nHe also said:\nThe Yin took the twelfth month as the first month, following the earthly mandate, and thus placed *Kun* first.\n\nYuan Zhen said:\nMu Jiang encountered *Gen*, which confirms the text of the historians. The Master obtained *Kun*, also following the first hexagram of *Return to the Hidden*.\n\nLi Shi said:\nAccording to *The Penetration of Qian*, “He who hangs down the royal divining stalks” refers to Fuxi, who already used the yarrow stalks to form doubled hexagrams. Yet in that age, the people were simple and the customs pure, so the method only used seven and eight. The sixty-four hexagrams all remained unmoving—*Qian* stopped at *Qian*, *Kun* at *Kun*—unable to change. The Xia and Shang followed this, all using seven and eight for divination; *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* are examples. Later ages grew decadent, and only then did they begin to use nine and six for divination, for without this, it would not suffice to respond to the changes of the world.\n\nLiu Chang said:\n*Kun* is where the myriad things return. The Shang placed *Kun* first. *The Evolution of Rites* says, “I obtained *Kun* and *Qian*,” referring to the *Changes* of *Return to the Hidden*.\n\nXing Bing said:\n*Return to the Hidden* was composed by Cheng Tang and is one of the Three *Changes*.\n\nOuyang Xiu said:\nBy the end of the Zhou, the *Changes* of Xia and Shang were already lost. Though *Return to the Hidden* existed in the early Han, it was no longer the ancient classic. Today, the three extant chapters cannot be thoroughly examined.\n\nShao Zi said:\nThe Shang took the month of *jianchou* as the first month, calling it the earthly mandate. The *Changes* is called *Return to the Hidden*, beginning with *Kun*. *Kun* is earth.\n\nFang Que said:\n*Return to the Hidden* begins with *Kun*, each returning to its root, concealing its use. These were the practices of the Yin, aligning with the earth’s seasons. The Yin used the earthly mandate, hence the name of the book.\n\nHuang Shang said:\nThe subtle and manifest are the knowledge of the *Changes*. Thus, the Shang called it *Return to the Hidden*. *Return to the Hidden* refers to its concealment of all uses.\n\nWang Guoguo said:\n*The Lǐjì* records Confucius saying, “I obtained *Kun* and *Qian*.” Zheng’s commentary states: “He obtained the Yin book of yin and yang; the surviving text is *Return to the Hidden*.”\n*The Ěryǎ: Explanation of Sheep* lists “male sheep,” and Guo Pu’s commentary cites *Return to the Hidden*: “Two gourds, two rams.”\n*The Chū Xué Jì: Clouds* cites *Return to the Hidden*: “A white cloud emerges from Cangwu and enters Daliang.” This can be seen.\n*The Revival Catalogue*:\n*Return to the Hidden*—in the Sui era, there were thirteen chapters. Today, only *The Initial Classic*, *The Mother of Milfoil*, and *The Origin of Yarrow* remain. The text is largely fragmented and disordered, impossible to interpret.\n\nWu Hang said:\n*The Zhōulǐ* states: “The Grand Diviner presides over the Three *Changes*: *Continuous Mountains*, *Return to the Hidden*, and *The Zhou Changes*. Their primary hexagrams are eight, and their derived hexagrams are sixty-four.” Thus, the hexagrams of *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* were already doubled in the time of the Three Sovereigns, while *The Zhou Changes* was doubled in the age of King Wen.\n\nWu Renjie said:\n*Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* use the unchanging for divination, and their prognostication does not extend beyond the original hexagram. *The Zhou Changes* uses the unchanging for divination, but its prognostication must pass through two hexagrams. This can be verified in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.\n\nWei Liaoweng said:\nThe meaning of the Three *Changes* in *The Zhou Changes*: “Closing the door is called *Kun*”—this is *Return to the Hidden*. “Nothing is more flourishing than *Gen* in the beginning and end of the myriad things”—this is *Continuous Mountains*.\n\nLi Gang said: *Return to the Hidden* is the Shang *Changes*, beginning with *Kun*; hence it is called *Return to the Hidden*. Confucius, observing the Shang Dao in Song, obtained *Kun Qian*, which was likely a text of *Return to the Hidden*.\n\nZhu Zhen said: The *Initial Classic* of *Return to the Hidden* embodies the original intent of Fuxi. It is also said: The *Three Changes* in the *Rites of Zhou* all consist of eight primary hexagrams—these primary hexagrams are the eight trigrams of the *Initial Classic*.\n\nZhang Xingcheng said: The Shang called it *Return to the Hidden*, the *Changes* of Earth. The meaning of *The Original Bundle* is derived from it.\n\nZheng E said: *Return to the Hidden* begins with *Kun*, the *Changes* of the Shang people. Its hexagram is *Kun* above and *Kun* below, hence it is called *Return to the Hidden*, signifying the earthly Dao’s capacity to contain and all things’ return to concealment within it.\n\nZheng Qiao said: *Continuous Mountains* is lost. During the Tang, Sima Ying annotated thirteen scrolls of *Return to the Hidden*, which are now also lost. In the Sui, Xue Zhen annotated thirteen scrolls, but only three sections remain today: *Initial Classic*, *Maternal Lineage of Qi*, and *Root of the Yarrow Stalk*. These discuss divination, their language is plain, and their meaning ancient. Later scholars, deeming them unrefined, cast them aside in doubt. Yet *Continuous Mountains* was lost precisely because it was even more neglected than this. How could later generations ever replicate such works?\n\nYang Jian said: In Confucius’ time, *Return to the Hidden* still existed, which is why it is said he “obtained *Kun Qian* in Song.”\n\nLuo Mi said: The Yellow Emperor rectified *Kun* and *Qian*, separated *Li* and *Kan*, and based on images and numbers, adapted them to suit the needs of his era. Regarding earth as auspicious, he placed *Kun* first—this is the *Return to the Hidden Changes*. It is also said: *Return to the Hidden* is the book of the Gui Zang clan, which the Shang people adopted. It is further said: *Return to the Hidden* employs eight.\n\nLuo Ping said: *Return to the Hidden* is the Yellow Emperor’s *Changes*, yet *Kun Qi Divination* contains phrases like “Yao bestowed his two daughters as wives to Shun,” and the *Jie* hexagram states, “The Yin king’s state will constantly suffer famine in the moon’s season.” The hexagrams are correct, but the text is not—likely composed during the Tang era as part of *Return to the Hidden*.\n\nLin Xuemeng said: The *Commentary on the Changes* discusses *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden*, some claiming they are the works of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor, others asserting they are the *Changes* of Xia and Shang. It is unclear which is correct.\n\nJiang Junshi said: The Shang ordered the *Changes* with *Kun* first, from which their emphasis on simplicity and the color white in their rituals derived.\n\nLi Guo said: The *Essentials of the Changes* states: “Heaven is noble, earth is humble—this is the fixed position of *Qian* and *Kun*.” The Shang *Changes* begins with *Kun*, implying earth is nobler than heaven. The reason the Shang *Changes* did not endure is unknown. The Shang people established *chou* as their first month, taking the opposition of *chou* and *wei* as the earthly sequence. *Kun* represents earth, and since the Shang followed the earthly sequence, they placed *Kun* first.\n\nWang Yinglin said: In the *Outer Transmission of the Annals of Yue*, Fan Li says: “The Dao gives birth to qi, qi gives birth to yin, and yin gives birth to yang.” I consider the precedence of yin over yang to reflect *Return to the Hidden*’s placement of *Kun* first—closing before opening, stillness before movement.\n\nMa Duanlin said: *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* are the *Changes* of Xia and Shang, predating the *Zhou Changes*. However, the *Han Records of Arts and Letters* does not list *Return to the Hidden*, nor does the *Sui Records of Classics* include *Continuous Mountains*. These two works likely emerged between the Jin and Sui dynasties. *Continuous Mountains* was a forgery by Liu Xuan, as historical records explicitly state. It is reasonable to infer that *Return to the Hidden* is of the same nature.\n\nGe Yinyan said: *Return to the Hidden* is the *Changes* of the Yellow Emperor’s Middle Heaven.\n\nJia Xuanweng said: The book *Return to the Hidden* was composed by the Yellow Emperor, and the sixty *jia* alongside the sixty-four pre-heaven hexagrams were part of the *Middle Heaven Return to the Hidden Changes*.\n\nZhu Yuansheng said: Though *Return to the Hidden* was created by the Yellow Emperor, it followed Fuxi’s sequence of hexagrams. The *Han Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendars* states: “Fuxi drew the eight trigrams, beginning with numbers, and they were perfected by the Yellow Emperor.” Thus, Fuxi’s *Changes* and the Yellow Emperor’s *Changes* are unified in principle. It is also said: The *Rites of Zhou*’s *Grand Diviner* “presides over the methods of the Three *Changes*,” and the *Diviner* “presides over the Three *Changes* to distinguish the nine types of divination.” It never discarded *Return to the Hidden* in favor of the *Zhou Changes*. In the ninth year of Duke Xiang of Lu, Mu Jiang divined and encountered *Gen* changing to eight. Du Yu explained: “This mixed the use of *Continuous Mountains*, *Return to the Hidden*, and the *Zhou Changes*.” From this, we see that *Return to the Hidden* remained intact during the Spring and Autumn period. It is further said: *Return to the Hidden* follows the model of the *River Chart*. Since the *River Chart*’s ten is incomplete, *Return to the Hidden* omits ten. Wu Cheng said: *Return to the Hidden* is the *Changes* of the Shang. It is also said: The *Changes* of Xia and Shang likely employed the hexagrams drawn by Fuxi for divination, though their sequence differed from the natural order of pre-heaven hexagrams. Thus, *Continuous Mountains* begins with *Gen*, and *Return to the Hidden* begins with *Kun*.\n\nWu Lai said: *Return to the Hidden* in three scrolls, annotated by Xue Zhen of the Jin, now appears sporadically in other works, resembling Jiao Gong’s *Forest of Changes*—not the ancient *Changes*.\n\nZhao Daoyi said: The Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan, adopted Fuxi’s hexagram images and applied them, basing them on Shennong’s emphasis on the sixty-four hexagrams. The Emperor then expounded on the eight trigrams, calling them the “Eight Searches,” seeking the meaning of the doubled hexagrams.\n\nThe Emperor titled himself \"Guicang Shi\" and named his work the *Guicang* (*Return to the Hidden*)—this was the beginning of the *Changes*. Zhu Yinlao said: The *Guicang* is the *Changes* of the Yellow Emperor, beginning with *Kun*; all who established the *chou* (the second Earthly Branch) took it as their model, not only the people of Yin. Zhu Sheng said: The *Guicang* begins with *Kun*, the origin of stillness and movement. Ding Yidong said: The Xia called it *Lianshan*, the Shang called it *Guicang*; though they differ in beginning with *Gen* or *Kun*, both take the lower hexagram as the *zhen* (primary) and the upper as the *hui* (regret). Thus, the *Hongfan* of Jizi speaks only of divining with the two. He Qiaoxin said: The *Sui Dynasty’s “Record of Classics and Books”* includes a *Guicang* in thirteen scrolls, presented by Liu Guangbo, though its content is shallow and vulgar. Though the book is no longer extant, the *Changes*’ notion of *Kun* concealing things preserves the lingering intent of the *Guicang*. He Mengchun said: The Yin *Changes* places *Kun* before *Qian*, for stillness precedes movement—this is the fixed principle of yin and yang. Yang Shen said: The *Lianshan* was stored in the Orchid Terrace, and the *Guicang* in the Grand Diviner’s archives, as seen in Huan Tan’s *New Discourses*. Thus, in the Later Han, both the *Lianshan* and *Guicang* still existed; one should not doubt their authenticity merely because the *Art and Literature Annals* omits them. Hu Yinglin said: The *Seven Summaries* does not include the *Guicang*, but the *Central Catalog* first records it, and the *Sui Annals* follows, calling it a book “concerned only with divination, unlike the intent of the sages.” By the Tang, it was already suspected of being a forgery. Zheng Yuanxi said: The *Guicang* begins with *Kun*, concealing before manifesting. Confucius said, “I wished to observe the Way of Shang and found *Kun* and *Qian* there,” praising it. Yet it is narrow compared to the *Changes*. Shen Maoxiao said: The Shang *Changes* begins with *Kun* to conceal and gather, then sets in motion the mechanism of direct action. Hao Jing said: The *Guicang*’s *Kun* hexagram represents Earth; the myriad beings return to the soil, hence the name *Guicang* (*Return to the Hidden*). Jiao Hong said: The *Guicang* is *Kun*; scholars of the Shang era prioritized stillness. Dong Sizhang said: The *Guicang Changes* is now lost, surviving only in the names of sixty-four hexagrams, four of which are missing, differing from the *Zhou Changes*. Sun Qifeng said: The *Guicang* begins with *Kun*, which conceals. Worldly affairs are not exhausted by manifestation but by concealment; if retreat and concealment are not secure, vitality withers, leading to daily desiccation. Thus, concealment is nurturance, and the primal power of *Kun* sustains life. Xu Shan said: The *Guicang* has been lost for a long time. Some seek it in the *Ancient Three Tombs* or the works of Sima Ying and Xue Zhen—these are erroneous. Others mistakenly identify books on *guihun* (returning spirits) or *najia* (heavenly stems) as the *Guicang*—these are crude. Still others misinterpret the phrase “*Qian* rules, *Kun* conceals” and claim the square diagram is the *Guicang*—this is forced. As for Wei Shi’s reckless fabrications, they are outright reckless. Zhu Yizun said: According to records, the *Guicang* still existed in the Sui, and by the Song, it retained three chapters: *Initial Classic*, *Mother of Qi*, and *Root of the Milfoil*. The passages cited in commentaries are archaic and profound. Yet Kong Yingda’s *Correct Meaning* dismisses the *Guicang* as a fraudulent work—this is not entirely justified. As for the *Three Tombs Book*, which classifies the *Guicang Changes* as the *Qi Tomb*, its hexagram and trigram images state: “The qi of Heaven returns, the qi of Earth conceals, the qi of Wood generates, the qi of Wind moves, the qi of Fire grows, the qi of Water nurtures, the qi of Mountain halts, the qi of Metal kills,” each with its own commentary. This differs greatly from the passages cited in traditional commentaries. Ma Su said: The *Rites of Zhou* states that the Grand Scribe oversees the three *Changes*. Later scholars identified the *Guicang* as the name of the Yin *Changes*; its oracle phrases, as cited in various texts, are ancient and unadorned.\n\nThe Qin bamboo slip version of the *Guicang*—the *Guicang* from Qin Tomb No. 15 at Wangjiatai, Jiangling—includes 164 numbered bamboo slips and 230 unnumbered fragments, totaling 394 slips with approximately 4,000 characters. Due to severe damage, no complete slip has been reconstructed, and their sequence remains undetermined. Among these slips, there are seventy sets of hexagram drawings, sixteen of which are duplicates. Excluding duplicates, fifty-four distinct hexagram drawings remain. All hexagrams use “一” for yang lines and “∧” for yin lines. There are seventy-six hexagram names, twenty-three of which are repeated, yielding fifty-three unique names. Some hexagram phrases are also duplicated. The slips come in two types: one wide and thin, the other narrow and thick. Thus, we infer that this batch of *Guicang* includes two different copies. The hexagram drawings in the Qin slips all correspond to those in the received *Zhou Changes*, and most hexagram names align with transmitted versions of the *Guicang*, the Mawangdui silk *Zhou Changes*, and the received *Zhou Changes*. Below are selected transcriptions (primarily from the beginnings of slips; duplicates are transcribed once unless their hexagram drawings or names complement each other, in which case all are included). The transcriptions roughly follow the sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams in Ma Guohan’s *Jade Case Mountain Studio Collection of Lost Books*. The numbers below are the original cleaning numbers, while those above are provisional sequence numbers.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nFragments of bamboo slips are marked with ◇; illegible characters due to blurred traces are marked with □. Phonetic loans and variant characters are not separately annotated, but obvious omissions in the text are supplemented with 【】.

Though evidence was insufficient, I obtained *Kun* and *Qian* there.\" Zheng’s annotation states: \"The Shang’s book on yin and yang that survives is the *Guicang*,\" thus also identifying the *Guicang* as the Shang *Yi*.\n\nThe *Han History*, \"Treatise on Arts and Letters,\" does not record it. The Jin *Central Catalog* first includes it. Ruan Xiaoxu’s *Seven Records* states: \"The *Guicang* is a miscellaneous work on divination and various matters.\" The *History of the Sui*, \"Treatise on Classics and Books,\" lists thirteen fascicles, with commentary by Xue Zhen, a military aide to the Grand Commandant of Jin. The *Tang History*, \"Treatise on Arts and Letters,\" records the same number of fascicles. The Song *Revival Book Catalog* includes three chapters: *Initial Canon*, *Mother of Qi*, and *Root of the Milfoil*. Many scholars, considering it a later fabrication, cast doubt on its authenticity. Zheng Qiao’s *Comprehensive Treatises* argues: \"It speaks of divination; its language is plain, its meaning ancient. Later scholars, finding it unrefined, suspect and discard it—yet do they not know that later generations could compose such texts?\" Yang Shen also notes: \"The *Lianshan* was stored in the Orchid Terrace; the *Guicang*, in the Grand Diviner’s archives,\" as seen in Huan Tan’s *New Discourses*. Thus, in the Later Han, both the *Lianshan* and *Guicang* still existed. One cannot dismiss them merely because the *Treatise on Arts and Letters* omits them. Examining its surviving hexagrams, such as:\n\n*\"Ju: There is a *ju*; there is a *gu*. Millet is brewed into wine, poured into twin flasks. Two ewes drink it; after three days, they become drunk. The knight has marshland—I take its fish.\"*\n\n*\"The good man obtains his jade; the noble man obtains his grain.\"*\n\n*\"There are wild ducks and mandarin ducks; there are geese and egrets.\"*\n\nAll employ rhymed verses, archaic and recitable, akin to the oracle phrases recorded in the *Zuo Tradition*. The *Forest of Hexagrams* by Jiao Yanshou derives from this. Though lines like \"the sun is exhausted\" or \"the moon flees\" verge on the fantastical, even the great *Yi* draws imagery from \"dragons battling in the wild\" or \"a cartload of ghosts\"—nothing to discredit it. However, as a Shang *Yi*, it records \"King Wu’s secret divination\" and \"King Mu’s hexagram casting.\" Likely, the Zhou Grand Diviners, who preserved its methods, appended records of divinations and verifications to its chapters. Such texts could not have been composed by men of the Han or later.\n\nToday, even the three Song chapters are lost. Zhu Xi’s *Investigation of Classical Meaning* compiles it in great detail, serving as the basis for this edition. Where omissions remain, I have supplemented and stitched them together, appending various scholars’ discussions into one fascicle. Comparing this with the so-called *Qi Tomb Guicang* in the transmitted *Three Tombs*, authenticity and forgery can be immediately discerned.\n\nBy Ma Guohan of Licheng, styled Zhuwufu.\n\n---\n\n**Guicang**\n\n**Guicang: Initial Canon**\nZhu Zhen’s *Han River Yi* states: \"The *Yi* of the *Guicang*—its *Initial Canon*—embodies the original intent of Fuxi.\"\n\n**Initial Qian**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation* and Zhu Zhen’s *Collected Discourses on the Yi* both record its contention.\n\nLi Guo’s *Western Stream Yi Discourses* and Hu Yigui’s *Wings of Enlightenment on the Zhou Yi*\n\n**Initial Kun**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation*; Zhu Zhen says *Kun*.\n\n*\"The blossoms of glory.\"*\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment on the Zhou Yi*; Zhu’s *Investigation of Classical Meaning* cites it as \"glorious glory.\"\n\n**Initial Gen**\nGan Bao and Zhu Zhen both cite it as *Gen*. Li Guo’s *Western Stream Yi Discourses* and Huang Zongyan’s *Images and Words of the Zhou Yi* cite it as *Hen*. Huang explains: \"*Gen* is *hen* (fierce). *Gen* has the image of turning inward, silent and unsmiling, its countenance stern—thus taking its meaning from rigidity and fierceness?\"\n\n*\"The fox barks sharply.\"*\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*.\n\n**Initial Dui**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation* and Zhu Zhen’s *Collected Discourses on the Yi* record its speech as sincere.\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*\n\n**Initial Li**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation*; Zhu Zhen says *Kan*. Li Guo states: \"To call *Kan* *luo* (toil): *luo* means labor. It signifies the myriad things laboring within *Kan*.\" Huang Zongyan says: \"*Kan* is the hexagram of toil, hence derived from *lao* (labor) by phonetic loan and abbreviation. Nothing toils more than the ox, thus the character includes 'ox.'\"\n\n*\"For celebration, the body does not move.\"*\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*.\n\n**Initial Li**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation* and Zhu Zhen’s *Collected Discourses on the Yi*.\n\n*\"Li gazes intently.\"*\n\n*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*\n\n**Initial Zhen**\nGan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation*; Zhu Zhen says *Zhen*. Li Guo states: \"*Zhen* is *li* (order). *Li* means principle. As the Supreme emerges from *Zhen*, it is the beginning of the myriad things’ orderly patterns.\" Huang Zongyan says: \"*Zhen* is *li*. *Li* should correspond to *Li* (Fire), but *Zhen* (Thunder) is not close—could it be that thunder orders the earth to emerge and resound?\"",

Thus, the* Guicang Yi *nowhere fails to employ its principle of concealment. Of the sixty-four hexagrams, sixteen are for concealment, and forty-eight for application. Qian *is the father of the sixty-four hexagrams, and* Kun *their mother. Kun *governs the hexagrams of concealment, while* Qian *governs those of application. Thus,* Kun *and* Qian *head the sixty-four hexagrams. Where there is concealment, there must be application; hence, pure* Kun *precedes even pure* Qian.*\"*\n\nXu Shan’s *Four Yi* states: *\"The sequence of hexagrams in the* Guicang *is:* Kun, Zhen, Kan, Gen, Dui, Li, Xun, Qian. *This is because* Zhen *emerges with one yang born beneath pure* Kun. *Thereafter, it advances to* Kan *and centers, then to* Gen *and ascends, meeting at the fifth line to yield* Dui *with its two yangs—yet one yin still remains above. At* Li, *the central yang ascends; at* Xun, *the initial yang enters the center, thus completing the form of pure* Qian. *This is the sequence of yang qi’s gradual growth. Reversing the process:* Xun *begins with one yin born beneath pure* Qian. *It then advances to* Li *and centers, then to* Dui *and ascends, meeting at the fifth line to yield* Gen *with its two yins—yet one yang still remains above. At* Kan, *the central yin ascends; at* Zhen, *the initial yin enters the center, thus completing the form of pure* Kun. *This is the sequence of yin qi’s gradual growth and yang qi’s return to concealment. The name ‘Guicang’ likely derives from this. Numerically, when proceeding from below upward, it begins with eight and ends with two, for yang qi arises from nothing into being—this is the principle of ‘knowing the future in reverse.’ When proceeding from below upward, it begins with two and ends with eight, for yang qi returns from being into nothing—this is the principle of ‘reckoning the past in sequence.’ The sages named it* Guicang *to teach people the Dao of returning to the origin and renewing the beginning.\"*\n\nFollowing the sixty-four hexagrams as recorded in Li Guo’s *Western Stream Yi Discourses*—from *Qian* to *Matu*, totaling sixty hexagrams—four missing hexagrams are here supplemented.\n*Kun*: As cited in *Western Stream Yi Discourses*, with four missing hexagrams filled in according to Jia Gongyan’s *Record of Rites Subcommentary*: *\"This* Guicang Yi *takes* Kun *as its first,\"* based on the *Initial Classic*.\n*Qian*: As in *Western Stream Yi Discourses*, with the same method applied below.\n*Tun*\n*Meng*",

In ancient times, Qi of Xià divined *Míngyí*; Gǔn, in managing the waters, cast lots with *Dàmíng*; Jié divined *Yínghuò*; and King Wǔ, in his campaign against Shāng, cast lots with *Qílǎo*.\" Note: *Míngyí* cited in *Xīxī* is the same *Míngyí*.

The method is as follows: First, set a six-line *Kūn* hexagram, then sequentially transform it with six yang lines to form the five sovereign hexagrams *Fù*, *Lín*, *Tài*, *Dàzhuàng*, and *Guài*. Next, set a six-line *Qián* hexagram and sequentially transform it with six yin lines to form the five sovereign hexagrams *Gòu*, *Dùn*, *Pǐ*, *Guān*, and *Bō*. With these ten sovereign hexagrams established, the framework is complete. Then, set another six-line *Kūn* hexagram and transform it with the *Fù* sovereign to produce six hexagrams with one yang line; with the *Lín* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with two yang lines; with the *Tài* sovereign, twenty hexagrams with three yang lines; with the *Dàzhuàng* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with four yang lines; and with the *Guài* sovereign, six hexagrams with five yang lines. Proceeding further to pure *Qián*, the sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams is thus determined. Examining this process, the six positions of *Qián* have already become newly transformed lines, while the six positions of *Kūn* remain as the original untransformed lines—just as the yang lines in a hexagram have changed while the yin lines remain unchanged. Then, set the newly formed *Qián* hexagram and transform it with the *Gòu* sovereign to produce six hexagrams with one yin line; with the *Dùn* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with two yin lines; with the *Pǐ* sovereign, twenty hexagrams with three yin lines; with the *Guān* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with four yin lines; and with the *Bō* sovereign, six hexagrams with five yin lines. Proceeding further to the six positions of pure *Kūn*, the transformation is complete. Ultimately, there is no dual arrangement—only these sixty-four positions. Proceeding sequentially, through seven transformations of *Kūn*, one obtains one hundred ninety-two yang lines, revealing the body of pure *Kūn*. Reversing the process, through seven transformations of *Qián*, one obtains one hundred ninety-one yin lines, again revealing the body of pure *Kūn*. One inversion and one reversal complete the three hundred eighty-four lines of the *Yì*.\"\n\n**Guīcáng Qímǔjīng**\nThe meaning of \"*Qímǔ*\" is unclear. According to the *Guīcáng*, which takes *Kūn* as its beginning, *Kūn* is the mother of all things. Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shānhǎi Jīng* also cites the *Zhèngmǔjīng*, suggesting that the twelve sovereign hexagrams may correspond to the twelve terrestrial branches, though this is uncertain.\n\n*Qú*: There is *qú* and *gū*; millet is brewed into wine, offered in two vessels, and two ewes drink from them. After three days, they revive.\n\"A knight has a marsh; I take its fish.\"\n(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Ěryǎ*, under \"Sheep\" in the \"Beasts\" section, cites the *Guīcáng*: \"two vessels, two ewes.\" Xing Bing’s annotation states: \"This is the line text of the *Qú* hexagram from the *Guīcáng Qímǔjīng*.\" However, upon examining the passage, it appears Xing Bing’s attribution may be incorrect. The *Xīxī Yìshuō* cites the *Guīcáng* as including a hexagram named *Qú*, and this is its line text.)\n\n**Guīcáng Zhèngmǔjīng**\n*Míngyí* states: In ancient times, Qǐ of Xià divined: \"Riding a flying dragon to ascend to heaven,\" and cast lots with Gāoyáo, who said: \"Auspicious.\"\n(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shānhǎi Jīng* cites the *Guīcáng Zhèngmǔjīng*: \"Qǐ of Xià divined riding a flying dragon to ascend to heaven; it was auspicious.\")",

According to the Jin *Central Catalogue*, it existed, but it only recorded divination and did not resemble the intent of the sages.\n\nKong Yingda said:\n*Return to the Hidden* originated with the Yellow Emperor.\nHe also said:\nThe sages adapted to the times and circumstances, not necessarily following one another. Thus, the order of hexagrams in *Return to the Hidden* differs greatly.\nHe also said:\nConfucius said, “I obtained *Kun* and *Qian*.” The Yin *Changes* begins with *Kun*, placing it before *Qian*.\n\nJia Gongyan said:\nThis *Return to the Hidden Changes* begins with pure *Kun*. *Kun* is earth, and the myriad things all return and are stored within it.\nHe also said:\nThe Yin took the twelfth month as the first month, following the earthly mandate, and thus placed *Kun* first.\n\nYuan Zhen said:\nMu Jiang encountered *Gen*, which confirms the text of the historians. The Master obtained *Kun*, also following the first hexagram of *Return to the Hidden*.\n\nLi Shi said:\nAccording to *The Penetration of Qian*, “He who hangs down the royal divining stalks” refers to Fuxi, who already used the yarrow stalks to form doubled hexagrams. Yet in that age, the people were simple and the customs pure, so the method only used seven and eight. The sixty-four hexagrams all remained unmoving—*Qian* stopped at *Qian*, *Kun* at *Kun*—unable to change. The Xia and Shang followed this, all using seven and eight for divination; *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* are examples. Later ages grew decadent, and only then did they begin to use nine and six for divination, for without this, it would not suffice to respond to the changes of the world.\n\nLiu Chang said:\n*Kun* is where the myriad things return. The Shang placed *Kun* first. *The Evolution of Rites* says, “I obtained *Kun* and *Qian*,” referring to the *Changes* of *Return to the Hidden*.\n\nXing Bing said:\n*Return to the Hidden* was composed by Cheng Tang and is one of the Three *Changes*.\n\nOuyang Xiu said:\nBy the end of the Zhou, the *Changes* of Xia and Shang were already lost. Though *Return to the Hidden* existed in the early Han, it was no longer the ancient classic. Today, the three extant chapters cannot be thoroughly examined.\n\nShao Zi said:\nThe Shang took the month of *jianchou* as the first month, calling it the earthly mandate. The *Changes* is called *Return to the Hidden*, beginning with *Kun*. *Kun* is earth.\n\nFang Que said:\n*Return to the Hidden* begins with *Kun*, each returning to its root, concealing its use. These were the practices of the Yin, aligning with the earth’s seasons. The Yin used the earthly mandate, hence the name of the book.\n\nHuang Shang said:\nThe subtle and manifest are the knowledge of the *Changes*. Thus, the Shang called it *Return to the Hidden*. *Return to the Hidden* refers to its concealment of all uses.\n\nWang Guoguo said:\n*The Lǐjì* records Confucius saying, “I obtained *Kun* and *Qian*.” Zheng’s commentary states: “He obtained the Yin book of yin and yang; the surviving text is *Return to the Hidden*.”\n*The Ěryǎ: Explanation of Sheep* lists “male sheep,” and Guo Pu’s commentary cites *Return to the Hidden*: “Two gourds, two rams.”\n*The Chū Xué Jì: Clouds* cites *Return to the Hidden*: “A white cloud emerges from Cangwu and enters Daliang.” This can be seen.\n*The Revival Catalogue*:\n*Return to the Hidden*—in the Sui era, there were thirteen chapters. Today, only *The Initial Classic*, *The Mother of Milfoil*, and *The Origin of Yarrow* remain. The text is largely fragmented and disordered, impossible to interpret.\n\nWu Hang said:\n*The Zhōulǐ* states: “The Grand Diviner presides over the Three *Changes*: *Continuous Mountains*, *Return to the Hidden*, and *The Zhou Changes*. Their primary hexagrams are eight, and their derived hexagrams are sixty-four.” Thus, the hexagrams of *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* were already doubled in the time of the Three Sovereigns, while *The Zhou Changes* was doubled in the age of King Wen.\n\nWu Renjie said:\n*Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* use the unchanging for divination, and their prognostication does not extend beyond the original hexagram. *The Zhou Changes* uses the unchanging for divination, but its prognostication must pass through two hexagrams. This can be verified in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.\n\nWei Liaoweng said:\nThe meaning of the Three *Changes* in *The Zhou Changes*: “Closing the door is called *Kun*”—this is *Return to the Hidden*. “Nothing is more flourishing than *Gen* in the beginning and end of the myriad things”—this is *Continuous Mountains*.",

      "original_text": "李纲曰：《归藏》，商易也，以坤为首，故曰《归藏》。 孔子观商道于宋，得《坤乾》焉，盖《归藏》之书。 朱震曰：《归藏》之书，其《初经》者，庖牺氏之本旨也。 又曰：《周礼》三《易》经卦皆八，所谓经卦，则《初经》八卦也。 张行成曰：商曰《归藏》，地《易》也。 《元包》义取之。 郑锷曰：《归藏》以坤为首，商人之《易》。 其卦坤上坤下，故曰《归藏》，言如地道之包含，万物所归而藏也。 郑樵曰：《连山》亡矣，《归藏》唐有司马膺注十三卷，今亦亡，隋有薛贞注十三卷，今所存者，《初经》、《齐母》、《本蓍》三篇，而已言占筮事，其辞质，其义古，后学以其不文则疑而弃之，往往《连山》所以亡者，且过于此矣，独不知后之人，能为此乎？ 杨简曰：孔子之时，《归藏》犹存，故曰“之宋得《坤乾》焉”。 罗泌曰：黄帝正坤乾，分离坎，倚象衍数，以成一代之宜，谓土为祥，乃重坤以为首，所谓《归藏易》也。 又曰：《归藏》者，归藏氏之书也，商人因之。 又曰：《归藏》用八。 罗苹曰：《归藏》，黄帝《易》，而《坤 启筮》乃有“尧降二女以为舜妃”之语，《节》卦云：“殷王其国常毋谷月”之类，其卦是也，其文非也，盖《归藏》之文，汤代之作。 林学蒙曰：《易疏》论《连山》、《归藏》一以为伏羲、黄帝之书，一以为夏商之《易》，未知孰是。 蒋君实曰：商之序《易》，以坤为首，其尚质，尚白之制，皆自此出也。 李过曰：《易钞》云：“天尊地卑，乾坤之定位也，商《易》首坤，是地尊乎天也。 ”商《易》所以不传，不知商人建丑，以十二月为岁首，取丑未之冲为地统，坤为地，商用地统，只得首坤。 王应麟曰：《越绝外传》范子曰：“道生气，气生阴，阴生阳”，愚谓先阴后阳，即《归藏》先坤之意，阖而辟，静而动。 马端临曰：《连山》、《归藏》乃夏商之《易》，本在《周易》之前，然《归藏》《汉志》无之，《连山》《隋志》无之，盖二书至晋、隋间始出，而《连山》出于刘炫伪作，此史明言之，度《归藏》之为书，亦此类尔。 葛寅炎曰：《归藏》，黄帝中天易也。 家铉翁曰：《归藏》之书，作于黄帝，而六十甲与先天六十四卦并行者，乃中天《归藏易》也。 朱元升曰：《归藏》虽自黄帝作，实循伏羲之序卦，《汉 律历志》曰：“伏羲画八卦，由数而起，至黄帝而大备”，是知伏羲《易》与黄帝《易》一以贯之者也。 又曰：《周礼 太卜》：“掌三《易》之法”、“筮人掌三《易》以辨九筮之名”，初未尝以《周易》废《归藏》也。 鲁襄公九年，穆姜为筮而遇艮之八，杜预释之曰：“是杂用《连山》、《归藏》、《周易》也”，以此见春秋之时《归藏》尚无恙也。 又曰：《归藏》取则《河图》者也。 《河图》藏十不具，是以《归藏》去十不用。 吴澄曰：《归藏》，商之《易》。 又曰：夏商二《易》，盖因羲皇所画之卦而用之，以占筮，卦序与先天自然之序不同，故《连山》首艮，《归藏》首坤。 吴莱曰：《归藏》三卷，晋薛贞注，今或杂见他书，颇类焦赣《易林》，非古《易》也。 赵道一曰：轩辕黄帝取伏羲卦象，法而用之，据神农所重六十四卦之义，帝乃作八卦之说，谓之“八索”，求重卦之义也。",
      "translated_text": "Li Gang said: *Return to the Hidden* is the Shang *Changes*, beginning with *Kun*; hence it is called *Return to the Hidden*. Confucius, observing the Shang Dao in Song, obtained *Kun Qian*, which was likely a text of *Return to the Hidden*.\n\nZhu Zhen said: The *Initial Classic* of *Return to the Hidden* embodies the original intent of Fuxi. It is also said: The *Three Changes* in the *Rites of Zhou* all consist of eight primary hexagrams—these primary hexagrams are the eight trigrams of the *Initial Classic*.\n\nZhang Xingcheng said: The Shang called it *Return to the Hidden*, the *Changes* of Earth. The meaning of *The Original Bundle* is derived from it.\n\nZheng E said: *Return to the Hidden* begins with *Kun*, the *Changes* of the Shang people. Its hexagram is *Kun* above and *Kun* below, hence it is called *Return to the Hidden*, signifying the earthly Dao’s capacity to contain and all things’ return to concealment within it.\n\nZheng Qiao said: *Continuous Mountains* is lost. During the Tang, Sima Ying annotated thirteen scrolls of *Return to the Hidden*, which are now also lost. In the Sui, Xue Zhen annotated thirteen scrolls, but only three sections remain today: *Initial Classic*, *Maternal Lineage of Qi*, and *Root of the Yarrow Stalk*. These discuss divination, their language is plain, and their meaning ancient. Later scholars, deeming them unrefined, cast them aside in doubt. Yet *Continuous Mountains* was lost precisely because it was even more neglected than this. How could later generations ever replicate such works?\n\nYang Jian said: In Confucius’ time, *Return to the Hidden* still existed, which is why it is said he “obtained *Kun Qian* in Song.”\n\nLuo Mi said: The Yellow Emperor rectified *Kun* and *Qian*, separated *Li* and *Kan*, and based on images and numbers, adapted them to suit the needs of his era. Regarding earth as auspicious, he placed *Kun* first—this is the *Return to the Hidden Changes*. It is also said: *Return to the Hidden* is the book of the Gui Zang clan, which the Shang people adopted. It is further said: *Return to the Hidden* employs eight.\n\nLuo Ping said: *Return to the Hidden* is the Yellow Emperor’s *Changes*, yet *Kun Qi Divination* contains phrases like “Yao bestowed his two daughters as wives to Shun,” and the *Jie* hexagram states, “The Yin king’s state will constantly suffer famine in the moon’s season.” The hexagrams are correct, but the text is not—likely composed during the Tang era as part of *Return to the Hidden*.\n\nLin Xuemeng said: The *Commentary on the Changes* discusses *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden*, some claiming they are the works of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor, others asserting they are the *Changes* of Xia and Shang. It is unclear which is correct.\n\nJiang Junshi said: The Shang ordered the *Changes* with *Kun* first, from which their emphasis on simplicity and the color white in their rituals derived.\n\nLi Guo said: The *Essentials of the Changes* states: “Heaven is noble, earth is humble—this is the fixed position of *Qian* and *Kun*.” The Shang *Changes* begins with *Kun*, implying earth is nobler than heaven. The reason the Shang *Changes* did not endure is unknown. The Shang people established *chou* as their first month, taking the opposition of *chou* and *wei* as the earthly sequence. *Kun* represents earth, and since the Shang followed the earthly sequence, they placed *Kun* first.\n\nWang Yinglin said: In the *Outer Transmission of the Annals of Yue*, Fan Li says: “The Dao gives birth to qi, qi gives birth to yin, and yin gives birth to yang.” I consider the precedence of yin over yang to reflect *Return to the Hidden*’s placement of *Kun* first—closing before opening, stillness before movement.\n\nMa Duanlin said: *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* are the *Changes* of Xia and Shang, predating the *Zhou Changes*. However, the *Han Records of Arts and Letters* does not list *Return to the Hidden*, nor does the *Sui Records of Classics* include *Continuous Mountains*. These two works likely emerged between the Jin and Sui dynasties. *Continuous Mountains* was a forgery by Liu Xuan, as historical records explicitly state. It is reasonable to infer that *Return to the Hidden* is of the same nature.\n\nGe Yinyan said: *Return to the Hidden* is the *Changes* of the Yellow Emperor’s Middle Heaven.\n\nJia Xuanweng said: The book *Return to the Hidden* was composed by the Yellow Emperor, and the sixty *jia* alongside the sixty-four pre-heaven hexagrams were part of the *Middle Heaven Return to the Hidden Changes*.\n\nZhu Yuansheng said: Though *Return to the Hidden* was created by the Yellow Emperor, it followed Fuxi’s sequence of hexagrams. The *Han Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendars* states: “Fuxi drew the eight trigrams, beginning with numbers, and they were perfected by the Yellow Emperor.” Thus, Fuxi’s *Changes* and the Yellow Emperor’s *Changes* are unified in principle. It is also said: The *Rites of Zhou*’s *Grand Diviner* “presides over the methods of the Three *Changes*,” and the *Diviner* “presides over the Three *Changes* to distinguish the nine types of divination.” It never discarded *Return to the Hidden* in favor of the *Zhou Changes*. In the ninth year of Duke Xiang of Lu, Mu Jiang divined and encountered *Gen* changing to eight. Du Yu explained: “This mixed the use of *Continuous Mountains*, *Return to the Hidden*, and the *Zhou Changes*.” From this, we see that *Return to the Hidden* remained intact during the Spring and Autumn period. It is further said: *Return to the Hidden* follows the model of the *River Chart*. Since the *River Chart*’s ten is incomplete, *Return to the Hidden* omits ten. Wu Cheng said: *Return to the Hidden* is the *Changes* of the Shang. It is also said: The *Changes* of Xia and Shang likely employed the hexagrams drawn by Fuxi for divination, though their sequence differed from the natural order of pre-heaven hexagrams. Thus, *Continuous Mountains* begins with *Gen*, and *Return to the Hidden* begins with *Kun*.\n\nWu Lai said: *Return to the Hidden* in three scrolls, annotated by Xue Zhen of the Jin, now appears sporadically in other works, resembling Jiao Gong’s *Forest of Changes*—not the ancient *Changes*.\n\nZhao Daoyi said: The Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan, adopted Fuxi’s hexagram images and applied them, basing them on Shennong’s emphasis on the sixty-four hexagrams. The Emperor then expounded on the eight trigrams, calling them the “Eight Searches,” seeking the meaning of the doubled hexagrams.",
      "overlap_context": " their prognostication does not extend beyond the original hexagram. *The Zhou Changes* uses the unchanging for divination, but its prognostication must pass through two hexagrams. This can be verified in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.\n\nWei Liaoweng said:\nThe meaning of the Three *Changes* in *The Zhou Changes*: “Closing the door is called *Kun*”—this is *Return to the Hidden*. “Nothing is more flourishing than *Gen* in the beginning and end of the myriad things”—this is *Continuous Mountains*.",

      "original_text": "帝一号“归藏氏”，乃名所制曰《归藏》书，此《易》之始也。 朱隐老曰：《归藏》，黄帝之《易》也，以坤为首，而凡建丑者宗之，不特殷人为然也。 朱升曰：《归藏》首坤，静动之首也。 丁易东曰：夏曰《连山》，商曰《归藏》，虽首艮、首坤之不同，然皆止以下卦为贞，上卦为悔，故箕子《洪笵》但云占用二耳。 何乔新曰：隋《经籍志》有《归藏》十三卷，出于刘光伯所上，意甚浅陋，书虽不传，《易》所谓坤以藏之，即《归藏》之遗意也。 何孟春曰：殷《易》先坤后乾，有静斯动，阴阳之定理也。 杨慎曰：《连山》藏于兰台，《归藏》藏于太卜，见桓谭《新论》，则后汉时《连山》、《归藏》犹存，不可以《艺文志》不列其目而疑之。 胡应麟曰：《七略》无《归藏》，《中经簿》始有此书，《隋志》因之称此书“惟载卜筮，不类圣人之旨”，盖唐世固疑其伪矣。 郑元锡曰：《归藏》首坤，藏而后发，孔子曰：“吾欲观商道，得坤乾焉”，盖善之也，然于《易》褊矣。 沈懋孝曰：商《易》首坤以藏敛，而发动直之机。 郝敬曰：《归藏》坤卦，坤为地，百昌归土曰《归藏》。 焦竑曰：《归藏》坤也，商时讲学者首重在静。 董斯张曰：《归藏易》今亡，惟存六十四卦名而又阙其四，与《周易》不同。 孙奇逢曰：《归藏》首坤，坤以藏之，天下事不竭于发而竭于藏，退藏不密生趣，所以日枯也，故藏者养也，坤元所以资生也。 徐善曰：《归藏》之亡久矣，有求之《古三坟》及司马膺、薛贞之书者，失之讹； 有即指归魂、纳甲之书为《归藏》者，失之陋； 有谬解乾君坤藏之语而谓方图即《归藏》者，失之附会； 若卫氏之操笔妄拟则失之肆矣。 朱彝尊曰：按《归藏》隋时尚存，至宋犹有《初经》、《齐母》、《本蓍》三篇，其见于传注所引者，辞皆古奥。 而孔氏《正义》谓《归藏》伪妄之书，亦未尽然。 若《三坟书》以《归藏易》为《气坟》，其爻卦大象曰：“天气归，地气藏，木气生，风气动，火气长，水气育，山气止，金气杀，各为之传，则较传注所引大不伦矣。 ” 马骕曰：《周礼》大史掌三《易》，近师以《归藏》为殷《易》之名也，其繇辞诸书所引用多古质。 秦简本《归藏》 江陵王家台15号秦墓出土竹简本《归藏》 王家台秦简《归藏》编号者一百六十四支，未编号的残简二百三十支，共计三百九十四支，总字数约四千余字。 由于残缺过甚，至今尚未拼出一支整简，顺序也难以排定。 在这批竹简重，共有七十组卦画，其中十六组相同，除去相同数，不同的卦画有五十四种。 卦画皆以一表示阳爻，以∧表示阴爻。 卦名有七十六个，其中重复者二十三个，实际卦名五十三个。 此外，卦辞也有一部分重复。 竹简有两种，一种宽而薄，而另一种窄而厚。 因此，我们推测，这批《归藏》有两种抄本。 秦简《归藏》的卦画皆可与今本《周易》对应起来，卦名也与传本《归藏》、不帛书《周易》及今本《周易》大部分相同。 现摘录部分释文如下（本释文以录简头为主，重复者只录其一，但卦画和卦名可互相补充者则皆录下来。 释文大致按马国翰《玉函山房辑佚书》之《六十四卦》的顺序排列，下面的编号为清理时的原始编号，上面的编号为临时序列号。",
      "translated_text": "The Emperor titled himself \"Guicang Shi\" and named his work the *Guicang* (*Return to the Hidden*)—this was the beginning of the *Changes*. Zhu Yinlao said: The *Guicang* is the *Changes* of the Yellow Emperor, beginning with *Kun*; all who established the *chou* (the second Earthly Branch) took it as their model, not only the people of Yin. Zhu Sheng said: The *Guicang* begins with *Kun*, the origin of stillness and movement. Ding Yidong said: The Xia called it *Lianshan*, the Shang called it *Guicang*; though they differ in beginning with *Gen* or *Kun*, both take the lower hexagram as the *zhen* (primary) and the upper as the *hui* (regret). Thus, the *Hongfan* of Jizi speaks only of divining with the two. He Qiaoxin said: The *Sui Dynasty’s “Record of Classics and Books”* includes a *Guicang* in thirteen scrolls, presented by Liu Guangbo, though its content is shallow and vulgar. Though the book is no longer extant, the *Changes*’ notion of *Kun* concealing things preserves the lingering intent of the *Guicang*. He Mengchun said: The Yin *Changes* places *Kun* before *Qian*, for stillness precedes movement—this is the fixed principle of yin and yang. Yang Shen said: The *Lianshan* was stored in the Orchid Terrace, and the *Guicang* in the Grand Diviner’s archives, as seen in Huan Tan’s *New Discourses*. Thus, in the Later Han, both the *Lianshan* and *Guicang* still existed; one should not doubt their authenticity merely because the *Art and Literature Annals* omits them. Hu Yinglin said: The *Seven Summaries* does not include the *Guicang*, but the *Central Catalog* first records it, and the *Sui Annals* follows, calling it a book “concerned only with divination, unlike the intent of the sages.” By the Tang, it was already suspected of being a forgery. Zheng Yuanxi said: The *Guicang* begins with *Kun*, concealing before manifesting. Confucius said, “I wished to observe the Way of Shang and found *Kun* and *Qian* there,” praising it. Yet it is narrow compared to the *Changes*. Shen Maoxiao said: The Shang *Changes* begins with *Kun* to conceal and gather, then sets in motion the mechanism of direct action. Hao Jing said: The *Guicang*’s *Kun* hexagram represents Earth; the myriad beings return to the soil, hence the name *Guicang* (*Return to the Hidden*). Jiao Hong said: The *Guicang* is *Kun*; scholars of the Shang era prioritized stillness. Dong Sizhang said: The *Guicang Changes* is now lost, surviving only in the names of sixty-four hexagrams, four of which are missing, differing from the *Zhou Changes*. Sun Qifeng said: The *Guicang* begins with *Kun*, which conceals. Worldly affairs are not exhausted by manifestation but by concealment; if retreat and concealment are not secure, vitality withers, leading to daily desiccation. Thus, concealment is nurturance, and the primal power of *Kun* sustains life. Xu Shan said: The *Guicang* has been lost for a long time. Some seek it in the *Ancient Three Tombs* or the works of Sima Ying and Xue Zhen—these are erroneous. Others mistakenly identify books on *guihun* (returning spirits) or *najia* (heavenly stems) as the *Guicang*—these are crude. Still others misinterpret the phrase “*Qian* rules, *Kun* conceals” and claim the square diagram is the *Guicang*—this is forced. As for Wei Shi’s reckless fabrications, they are outright reckless. Zhu Yizun said: According to records, the *Guicang* still existed in the Sui, and by the Song, it retained three chapters: *Initial Classic*, *Mother of Qi*, and *Root of the Milfoil*. The passages cited in commentaries are archaic and profound. Yet Kong Yingda’s *Correct Meaning* dismisses the *Guicang* as a fraudulent work—this is not entirely justified. As for the *Three Tombs Book*, which classifies the *Guicang Changes* as the *Qi Tomb*, its hexagram and trigram images state: “The qi of Heaven returns, the qi of Earth conceals, the qi of Wood generates, the qi of Wind moves, the qi of Fire grows, the qi of Water nurtures, the qi of Mountain halts, the qi of Metal kills,” each with its own commentary. This differs greatly from the passages cited in traditional commentaries. Ma Su said: The *Rites of Zhou* states that the Grand Scribe oversees the three *Changes*. Later scholars identified the *Guicang* as the name of the Yin *Changes*; its oracle phrases, as cited in various texts, are ancient and unadorned.\n\nThe Qin bamboo slip version of the *Guicang*—the *Guicang* from Qin Tomb No. 15 at Wangjiatai, Jiangling—includes 164 numbered bamboo slips and 230 unnumbered fragments, totaling 394 slips with approximately 4,000 characters. Due to severe damage, no complete slip has been reconstructed, and their sequence remains undetermined. Among these slips, there are seventy sets of hexagram drawings, sixteen of which are duplicates. Excluding duplicates, fifty-four distinct hexagram drawings remain. All hexagrams use “一” for yang lines and “∧” for yin lines. There are seventy-six hexagram names, twenty-three of which are repeated, yielding fifty-three unique names. Some hexagram phrases are also duplicated. The slips come in two types: one wide and thin, the other narrow and thick. Thus, we infer that this batch of *Guicang* includes two different copies. The hexagram drawings in the Qin slips all correspond to those in the received *Zhou Changes*, and most hexagram names align with transmitted versions of the *Guicang*, the Mawangdui silk *Zhou Changes*, and the received *Zhou Changes*. Below are selected transcriptions (primarily from the beginnings of slips; duplicates are transcribed once unless their hexagram drawings or names complement each other, in which case all are included). The transcriptions roughly follow the sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams in Ma Guohan’s *Jade Case Mountain Studio Collection of Lost Books*. The numbers below are the original cleaning numbers, while those above are provisional sequence numbers.",
