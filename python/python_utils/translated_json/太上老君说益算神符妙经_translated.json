  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture on the Wondrous Talismans for Prolonging Destiny**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture on the Wondrous Talismans for Prolonging Destiny*\n*Author unknown, likely composed during the Tang dynasty. Attributed to the Supreme Lord Lao, who expounds to the Celestial Master and his disciples the method of wearing the stellar talismans of the Northern Dipper to dispel illness and extend destiny. One fascicle.*\n\n**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture on the Wondrous Talismans for Prolonging Destiny**\n\nAt that time, the Supreme Lord Lao and the Perfected Celestial Master were together wandering the azure realms of the land of Chanli. There, they beheld all sentient beings suffering from untimely misfortunes—afflictions, illnesses, disasters, and sudden calamities—with many meeting premature ends.\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One rose from his seat and addressed the Supreme Lord Lao, saying: “Such beings—what rites or practices, what meritorious deeds, might they perform to attain deliverance, eternal longevity in this life, and freedom from disaster?”\n\nThe Lord Lao replied: “These beings each endure the four great sufferings of the body, for they do not comprehend the true Dao and thus fall into delusion.”\n\nThe Celestial Master bowed deeply, overjoyed, and inquired about the source of their transgressions.\n\nThe Lord Lao spoke in verse:\n*First, for disbelief in the Dao in past lives,*\n*Second, for neglecting cultivation in former existences,*\n*Third, for failing to turn toward the Dao while embodied,*\n*Fourth, for clinging to worldly entanglements in this life—*\n*Thus they invite disasters and manifold misfortunes,*\n*With afflictions, calamities, and illnesses unending.*\n*To dispel decline and avert disasters,*\n*Nothing surpasses pure fasting and the turning of destiny’s tally.*\n*Wear the numinous talismans always for protection,*\n*And secure long years, banishing malign influences.*\n\nWhen the Lord Lao had finished speaking these verses, it was the seventh day of the first month of the *shangyuan* *jiazi* year.\n\nThe Lord Lao then rode his chariot of purple clouds to the capital of Shu. On the fifteenth day of that month, he ascended his seat in the Red Stone City to expound the Dharma and universally deliver all beings.\n\nAt that time, Zhao Sheng and Wang Chang, who revered the Dao and its teachings, approached, knelt before him, and begged to become his disciples.\n\nThereupon, the Lord Lao commanded the Celestial Master to summon the stellar officials of the heavens, the Directors of Longevity, the Generals of the Six *Jia*, and the myriad celestial and terrestrial deities. Innumerable hosts assembled, and together they deliberated on the divine sounds to rescue all beings, freeing them from suffering. At once, they inscribed stone tablets as tokens, transmitting the numinous talismans and propagating the wondrous scripture to circulate throughout the world for the prolongation of destiny.\n\nThe Perfected One then bowed again and addressed the Lord: “Though the darkness has been dispelled, the beings still do not fully understand. If there are good men and good women who, relying on fasting and precepts, can uphold these teachings and not betray their master’s compassion, they shall forever escape all suffering. But for those who slander and disbelieve, what can be said to deliver them?”\n\nThe Lord Lao replied: “Excellent! Your heart pities all beings, and thus you ask such questions. Those who, generation after generation, reverently uphold the Dao without wavering—who burn incense, pay homage, and recite the true scriptures—shall attain peace of body and mind, prolonged destiny, augmented fortune and emolument, and daily progress toward the supreme Dao.”\n\nThe Lord Lao said: “The Dao can shelter and cherish, the Dao can nurture and sustain, the Dao can generate and perfect, the Dao can rescue and protect. Even for those whose allotted time is exhausted, the Dao can add twelve thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine years to their tally, aligning them with the Dao’s constancy. Heaven and earth unite in virtue, the myriad things flourish, and the Perfected Lords descend to the world, granting disciples prolonged life and destiny, while disasters and malevolent forces are pacified.\n\nFor all those beset by misfortune, decline, peril, or hardship—all who suffer from illness and distress—the Dao commands the Generals of the Six *Jia*, the stellar officials of the heavens, and the forty-eight thousand sagely hosts to come together and provide salvation.\n\nThe *Jiazi* General Wang Wenqing dispatches one hundred twenty officials to bestow upon disciple so-and-so twelve thousand pathways of bodily destiny, shielding the person and dispelling the hundred illnesses.\n\nThe *Jiaxu* General Zhan Zijiang dispatches one hundred twenty officials to establish for disciple so-and-so twelve thousand pathways of mental destiny, shielding the person and dispelling demonic delusions.\n\nThe *Jiashen* General Hu Wenchang dispatches one hundred twenty officials to augment for disciple so-and-so twelve thousand pathways of emolument destiny, shielding the person and dispelling depletion.\n\nThe *Jiawu* General Wei Shangqing dispatches one hundred twenty officials to augment for disciple so-and-so twelve thousand pathways of fortune destiny, shielding the person and dispelling untimely harm.\n\nThe *Jiachen* General Meng Feiqing dispatches one hundred twenty officials to safeguard for disciple so-and-so twelve thousand pathways of wealth destiny, shielding the person from decline and loss.\n\nThe *Jiayin* General Ming Wenzhang dispatches one hundred twenty officials to eternally secure for disciple so-and-so twelve thousand pathways of lifespan destiny, shielding the person from premature death.”\n\nThe Lord Lao said: “The Six Hundred *Jiazi* Lords of the Three Primes, the Lords of Prolonging Destiny for the Myriad Lives, and the Three Thousand Five Hundred Perfected Ones of Great Compassion and Radiant Brilliance shall all descend at once to rescue and protect the person, extending their years by ten thousand and enabling their ascent into true perfection.”\n\nAt that time, the great sages of the celestial asterisms severed all karmic enmity:\n\nThe Star Lord of Greedy Wolf of the Northern Dipper dispels noxious *qi*.\nThe Star Lord of Giant Gate of the Northern Dipper subdues lingering corpses.\nThe Star Lord of Emolument Storage of the Northern Dipper expels the hundred ghosts.\nThe Star Lord of Literary Brilliance of the Northern Dipper dispels nightmares.\nThe Star Lord of Integrity and Chastity of the Northern Dipper dispels slander and strife.\nThe Star Lord of Martial Brilliance of the Northern Dipper dispels official troubles.\nThe Star Lord of Broken Army of the Northern Dipper dispels depletion.\nThe Star Lord of Left Auxiliary of the Northern Dipper governs destiny’s tally.\nThe Star Lord of Right Assistant of the Northern Dipper governs the body’s form.\nThe Star Lords of the Three Terraces together augment emolument and longevity, averting misfortune.\n\nThe First Malevolent Star, the Second Auspicious Star, the Third Warding Star, the Fourth Sparkling Deluder Star, the Fifth Perilous Star—these revered stellar deities each dispel disasters and deliver disciple so-and-so from hardship, banishing the epidemic *qi* of the world, the ghosts of licentiousness, jealousy, and harm, driving them far away—thousands and tens of thousands of miles—swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the talismanic command of the Supreme Lord!”\n\nThe Lord Lao declares: “Now I proclaim and transmit this wondrous scripture, broadly expounding the methods of the Dao/Way. With talismans I succor humankind—those who wear and bear them must be diligent and earnest, their hearts ever reverent and faithful. Then shall they know no want of peace; the thousand disasters and ten thousand calamities shall all dissolve in their time. In movement and stillness, in going forth and staying in, auspicious omens shall daily draw near. Whatever they seek, whatever they desire, all shall be fulfilled according to their hearts.”\n\nThereupon the Heavenly Master, having received this wondrous method, composed a hymn, saying:\n“Divine talisman, divine talisman,\nIssuing from the Great Nothingness.\nGiving birth to Heaven, giving birth to Earth,\nRolling and unfolding with the Dao/Way.\nThose who wear and honor it\nShall see their perils and hardships dispelled.\nAttaining the true Dao/Way,\nTheir bodies shall ascend to the Dark Capital.”\n\nWhen the Heavenly Master had finished reciting this hymn, he bowed with his disciples Zhao Sheng and Wang Chang, took his leave, and withdrew.\n\nThus concludes *The Wondrous Scripture of the Talisman for Augmenting Destiny* as spoken by the Most High Lord Lao.",
