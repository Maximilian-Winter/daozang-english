Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, \"Wondrous Arts\" category of the *Dongshen* section.\n\n**Preface to *The Er’ya of Alchemical Minerals***\nThe *Er’ya* was composed by the ancients to explicate and resolve what was difficult to seek. I have always marveled at its ingenious and unparalleled mechanism. Thus, it has been employed by the court and endured through many ages. I am from Jiangyuan in western Shu. From youth, I was fond of the Dao and its arts, my nature inclined toward elixir techniques. From my tender years to the age of knowing fate, I exhaustively studied the classics and formulas, having perused the works of hundreds of masters—all as clear as the lines on my palm. Yet the ingredients they used were all concealed by hidden names. Within these hidden names, moreover, there were many variants. Without comprehensive knowledge, one might as well chase painted cakes or dreamt peaches; encountering their formulas would be no different from never having encountered them at all. I have often sighed in frustration over this matter, lamenting the absence of a teacher—what recourse is there?\n\nI once read in the *Cantong Qi*: \"If one cannot fully investigate, one should provide straightforward explanations—thus is the principle exhausted.\" The classic states: \"I wished to seal my tongue and speak not, fearing the crime of execution; yet to inscribe my thoughts on bamboo and silk would risk leaking the celestial tally.\" Thus do we know that the sagely and perfect Dao, the mysterious and wondrous method, is not meant for the vulgar—only by chance might it be heard and understood. Therefore, the matter is presented in a roundabout manner, so that superior scholars may diligently study it, while inferior scholars may discard and ridicule it—such is the evident principle.\n\nYet I fear that later learners may share my hardships. Thus, I have appended the oral instructions of six schools and the alternative names of various minerals, modeling the phrasing after the *Er’ya*. In six sections, I have compiled them into one fascicle, so that those lost in confusion may find it somewhat easier to seek, and those practicing the art may recite it without difficulty. I have also included all the alternative names for ingredients used in various elixirs, listing the designations of extraordinary formulas and rare safeguards that possess methods for preparation at the forefront, while those without methods or difficult to produce are recorded afterward.\n\nWritten in the *bingxu* year of the Yuanhe era of the Tang by Mei Biao.\n\n**The Er’ya of Alchemical Minerals, Fascicle One**\nCollected by Mei Biao.\n\n**Essential Secrets of Aerial Refinement: Explications of Obscure Drug Names**\n\n**Xuanhuang Hua (Mysterious Yellow Flower):** also called *Light Flight*, *Lead Flight*, *Flowing Flight*, *Fire Elixir*, *Good Flight*, *Purple Powder*.\n\n**Qianhuang Hua (Lead Yellow Flower):** also called *Yellow Elixir*, *Military Gate*, *Golden Willow*, *Lead Flower*, *Flower Canopy*, *Dragon Sap*, *Nine Radiance Elixir*.\n\n**Xijing (Tin Essence):** also called *Yellow Essence*, *Mysterious Yellow*, *Flying Essence*, *Golden Duke Flower*, *Yellow Fang*, *Subduing Elixir*, *Elixir Controller*, *Yellow Light*, *Yellow Chariot*, *Purple Powder*, *Yellow Flower*, *Yellow Dragon*, *Yellow Pool*, *River Chariot*, *Great Yin*, *Golden Essence*, *Golden Duke River Chariot*, *Plain Elixir White*, *False Duke Yellow*.\n\n**Qianjing (Lead Essence):** also called *Golden Duke*, *River Chariot*, *Water Tin*, *Great Yin*, *Plain Gold*, *Heavenly Mysterious Flying Male*, *Yellow of the Few*, *Standing Controller of Great Yin*, *Tiger Cub*, *Black Tiger*, *Mysterious Warrior*, *Yellow Male*, *Tiger*, *Black Gold*, *Azure Gold*.\n\n**Shuiyin (Mercury):** also called *Gong*, *Lead Essence*, *Divine Glue*, *Dark Maiden*, *Mysterious Water*, *Ziming*, *Flowing Pearl*, *Mysterious Pearl*, *Great Yin Flowing Pearl*, *White Tiger Brain*, *Longevity Child*, *Mysterious Water Dragon Cream*, *Yang Brightness Child*, *Riverbank Dark Maiden*, *Heaven-Born*, *Mysterious Maiden*, *Azure Dragon*, *Divine Water*, *Great Yang*, *Red Mercury*, *Sand Mercury*.\n\n**Shuiyin Shuang (Mercury Frost):** also called *Golden Liquid*, *Wu Sand Mercury Gold*, *White Tiger Brain*, *Golden-Silver Tiger*, *Red Emperor’s Corporeal Snow*;

preserve life. Should one encounter even a single method, it may be put to use. Yet if one attends to them all, the paths are indeed manifold. Among these many, only the Dao admits of superiority and inferiority—each follows the vessel’s capacity and pursues what it favors. Thus, water is unfit for riding swift steeds, and land is unsuited to sailing light boats. Though rice, millet, pickled greens, and meat all alike satisfy hunger, and hemp, ramie, fine silk, and coarse cloth all alike provide warmth, hunger and warmth may be the same, yet refinement and coarseness differ. Those who chase sweet profit prize the Lesser Elixir as gold; those who cherish longevity revere the Greater Elixir as treasure. The value of gold and treasure is equal to one’s allotted share—hence they are all recorded above.\n\n**On the Great Immortal Elixirs, Famed but Without Formulas:**\nYellow Emperor’s Nine-Crucible Elixir, Great Immortal Ascending-Rosy-Clouds Elixir, Purple Azure Immortal Youth Elixir, Supreme Harmony Dragon Embryo Elixir, Perfected Zhang’s Numinous Flight Elixir, Supreme One Eight-Luminaries Elixir, Ma Mingsheng’s White Sun Ascension Elixir, Golden Liquid Florescence Elixir, Lord Mao’s White Numinous Elixir, White Cloud Red Snow Elixir, Crimson Mound Hanging-Wall Elixir, Seven Essences Warding-Evil Elixir, Samādhi Disaster-Dispelling Elixir, Nine Radiance Divine Light Elixir, Flowing Rosy Fresh Verdant Elixir, Abode-Glow Casting-Radiance Elixir, Supreme Clarity Five-Colors Elixir, Northern Emperor Dark Pearl Elixir, Divine Light Scattering Fragrance Elixir, Congealed Frost Accumulated Snow Elixir, Shooting Star Moon-Repelling Elixir, Moon-Falling Heart-Alarming Elixir, Spirit-Resonant Descending Perfection Elixir, Spirit-Communing Servant-Commanding Elixir, Nine Transformations Elixir, Great Return Elixir, Ninefold Perfection Elixir, Purple Essence Elixir.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of Chu Marsh*, all the above elixirs were produced by ancient adepts who attained the Dao—transcendent elixirs of the world. Ingesting them, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight, sprouts feathered wings, and moves with unfettered transformation, sitting where one wills yet leaving no trace. Their ingredients and methods lie beyond the ken of mundane folk, and none may fathom their essential subtleties. Unless one bears innate immortal bones, has accumulated merit over generations, or receives the method in a dream from the gods, their formulas cannot be obtained.\n\n*Shiyao Er Ya*, Scroll Three, concludes.",

      "translated_text": "*The Er’ya of Alchemical Minerals*\n\n**Title:** *The Er’ya of Alchemical Minerals*. Compiled by Mei Biao of the Tang. One fascicle. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, \"Wondrous Arts\" category of the *Dongshen* section.\n\n**Preface to *The Er’ya of Alchemical Minerals***\nThe *Er’ya* was composed by the ancients to explicate and resolve what was difficult to seek. I have always marveled at its ingenious and unparalleled mechanism. Thus, it has been employed by the court and endured through many ages. I am from Jiangyuan in western Shu. From youth, I was fond of the Dao and its arts, my nature inclined toward elixir techniques. From my tender years to the age of knowing fate, I exhaustively studied the classics and formulas, having perused the works of hundreds of masters—all as clear as the lines on my palm. Yet the ingredients they used were all concealed by hidden names. Within these hidden names, moreover, there were many variants. Without comprehensive knowledge, one might as well chase painted cakes or dreamt peaches; encountering their formulas would be no different from never having encountered them at all. I have often sighed in frustration over this matter, lamenting the absence of a teacher—what recourse is there?\n\nI once read in the *Cantong Qi*: \"If one cannot fully investigate, one should provide straightforward explanations—thus is the principle exhausted.\" The classic states: \"I wished to seal my tongue and speak not, fearing the crime of execution; yet to inscribe my thoughts on bamboo and silk would risk leaking the celestial tally.\" Thus do we know that the sagely and perfect Dao, the mysterious and wondrous method, is not meant for the vulgar—only by chance might it be heard and understood. Therefore, the matter is presented in a roundabout manner, so that superior scholars may diligently study it, while inferior scholars may discard and ridicule it—such is the evident principle.\n\nYet I fear that later learners may share my hardships. Thus, I have appended the oral instructions of six schools and the alternative names of various minerals, modeling the phrasing after the *Er’ya*. In six sections, I have compiled them into one fascicle, so that those lost in confusion may find it somewhat easier to seek, and those practicing the art may recite it without difficulty. I have also included all the alternative names for ingredients used in various elixirs, listing the designations of extraordinary formulas and rare safeguards that possess methods for preparation at the forefront, while those without methods or difficult to produce are recorded afterward.\n\nWritten in the *bingxu* year of the Yuanhe era of the Tang by Mei Biao.\n\n**The Er’ya of Alchemical Minerals, Fascicle One**\nCollected by Mei Biao.",

      "translated_text": "The above-listed formulas, all extant in the world’s written records, may serve to secure wealth and profit or to nurture one’s nature and preserve life. Should one encounter even a single method, it may be put to use. Yet if one attends to them all, the paths are indeed manifold. Among these many, only the Dao admits of superiority and inferiority—each follows the vessel’s capacity and pursues what it favors. Thus, water is unfit for riding swift steeds, and land is unsuited to sailing light boats. Though rice, millet, pickled greens, and meat all alike satisfy hunger, and hemp, ramie, fine silk, and coarse cloth all alike provide warmth, hunger and warmth may be the same, yet refinement and coarseness differ. Those who chase sweet profit prize the Lesser Elixir as gold; those who cherish longevity revere the Greater Elixir as treasure. The value of gold and treasure is equal to one’s allotted share—hence they are all recorded above.\n\n**On the Great Immortal Elixirs, Famed but Without Formulas:**\nYellow Emperor’s Nine-Crucible Elixir, Great Immortal Ascending-Rosy-Clouds Elixir, Purple Azure Immortal Youth Elixir, Supreme Harmony Dragon Embryo Elixir, Perfected Zhang’s Numinous Flight Elixir, Supreme One Eight-Luminaries Elixir, Ma Mingsheng’s White Sun Ascension Elixir, Golden Liquid Florescence Elixir, Lord Mao’s White Numinous Elixir, White Cloud Red Snow Elixir, Crimson Mound Hanging-Wall Elixir, Seven Essences Warding-Evil Elixir, Samādhi Disaster-Dispelling Elixir, Nine Radiance Divine Light Elixir, Flowing Rosy Fresh Verdant Elixir, Abode-Glow Casting-Radiance Elixir, Supreme Clarity Five-Colors Elixir, Northern Emperor Dark Pearl Elixir, Divine Light Scattering Fragrance Elixir, Congealed Frost Accumulated Snow Elixir, Shooting Star Moon-Repelling Elixir, Moon-Falling Heart-Alarming Elixir, Spirit-Resonant Descending Perfection Elixir, Spirit-Communing Servant-Commanding Elixir, Nine Transformations Elixir, Great Return Elixir, Ninefold Perfection Elixir, Purple Essence Elixir.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of Chu Marsh*, all the above elixirs were produced by ancient adepts who attained the Dao—transcendent elixirs of the world. Ingesting them, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight, sprouts feathered wings, and moves with unfettered transformation, sitting where one wills yet leaving no trace. Their ingredients and methods lie beyond the ken of mundane folk, and none may fathom their essential subtleties.
