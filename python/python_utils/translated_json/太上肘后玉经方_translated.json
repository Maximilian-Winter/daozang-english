  "full_translation": "*The Supreme Jade Formula from Behind the Elbow of the Most High*\n*Title:* *The Supreme Jade Formula from Behind the Elbow of the Most High*\nCompiled by Lu Daoyuan of the Tang dynasty. One scroll.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, Methods category.\n\n*The Supreme Jade Formula from Behind the Elbow of the Most High*\nCompiled by Xiaobingzi Lu Daoyuan\n\nLong ago, Chaojuzi served the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea, enduring hardship with a steadfast heart and reverent devotion. Through scorching summers and bitter winters, he never faltered nor rested. After twenty years, the Azure Lad orally transmitted the mysterious methods and personally inscribed the sacred formulas.\n\nHe said: \"If you seek to ride a crane and ascend the Nine Heavens, it is not easily attained. Yet if you roam leisurely within Heaven and Earth, preserving the untainted qi, your complexion will remain unchanged, your mind and eyes clear, and you may live for hundreds of years—never to perish.\n\nHowever, the secret arts of immortals must not be passed to the unworthy. During the Chang’an era, Chaojuzi deemed Hanqizi a man of virtue and had him bathe, fast, and purify himself before transmitting the teachings. In the eighth year of Zhenyuan, Hanqizi, seeing that I was unassuming and free from worldly attachments, that my associations were not of the common sort, and that my nature seemed divinely ordained, deemed me worthy of the transmission and bade me pass it on.\n\nI, in turn, found Yinqizi to be a man of literary refinement. Though he once ranked among the highest scholars, he suddenly abandoned worldly pursuits and turned his heart to the Daoist gate. For six or seven years, he mastered every mysterious method and secret art, yet the essence of the supreme principle still eluded him. Considering the legacy of trust left to me, and knowing him to be a man of true resolve—one who had forsaken rank and wealth, wandering in leisure, composing verses of elegance, possessing yet appearing as if he had nothing, substantial yet seeming empty—I knew he was destined for transcendence, not merely to share the longevity of tortoises and cranes.\n\nThus, in the year *Baoli* *yimao*, Xiaobingzi Lu Daoyuan presented the *Scroll of the Eight Directions’ Binding and Sealing of the Mysterious Treasure of the Most High* to the recluse Shi Jun. Hold it in reverence, guard it with caution, and diligently cultivate yourself to attain its numinous efficacy.\n\n*Formula of the Seven Essences of Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother*\n\n**Formula of the Three Heavens’ Bamboo Essence and Two Suns’ Qi**\nThree *liang* of bamboo fruit—essence of the Three Heavens and Two Suns—steamed nine times and sun-dried nine times, governs water-qi.\n\n**Formula of the Four Great Earth-Skin Seeds**\nTwo *liang* of earth-skin seeds—essence of the Great Yin—governs the liver and brightens the eyes.\n\n**Formula of the Four Great Yellow Essences**\nTwo *liang* of yellow essence—essence of *wu* and *ji*—governs the spleen and viscera.\n\n**Formula of the Three Great Creeping-Essence Seeds**\nTwo *liang* of creeping-essence seeds, steamed nine times, dispels malevolent spirits and brightens the eyes.\n\n**Formula of the Three Great Pine Resins**\nTwo *liang* of pine resin, refined until hot, governs wind-madness, numbness, and dampness.\n\n**Formula of the Four Great Peach Resins**\nTwo *liang* of peach resin—essence of the Five Woods—governs demonic afflictions.\n\n**Formula of the Five Great Giant Victories**\nTwo *liang* of giant victory seeds—essence of the Five Grains—sun-dried nine times.\n\nThe above formula was transmitted of old to the Yellow Emperor, who consumed it and ascended on high. Should you wish to transmit it, erect an altar, burn incense, and invoke the Supreme Emperor; only then may it be conferred. Swear an oath not to leak it, and transmit it but once every forty years. Fail this, and the Most High will revoke your allotted years, and seven generations of your ancestors will be examined by the Water Bureau. Take heed.\n\n**Formula of the Earthly Wind Duke’s Four Fans**\nThree *liang* of five-spirit fat, prolongs years and augments life.\nThree *liang* of immortal灵脾, strengthens sinews and bones.\nThree *liang* of pine resin, treats wind-pain.\nThree *liang* of marsh rush, strengthens the kidneys’ root.\nTwo *liang* of wood, augments qi and strength.\nTwo *liang* of dried ginger, augments qi.\nFive *liang* of raw dried rehmannia, replenishes marrow and blood.\nThree *liang* of stone calamus, augments heart-spirit.\nThree *liang* of cassia heart, replenishes depletion and insufficiency.\nFour *liang* of mica powder, lengthens flesh, plumps and whitens the skin.\n\nThe above formula was transmitted by the Wind Duke to the Yellow Emperor, conferred by Gaoqiuzi, and later passed to Mao Gu. Should you transmit it, swear an oath not to leak it recklessly.\n\n**Grind each ingredient into powder, then combine and pound thirty thousand times; honeyed pills may also be made.**\n\n**Gen Wangjun’s Placental Elixir**\nOne human placenta.\n*Song of the Queen Mother* says:\nOne placenta, dragon’s latent transformation.\nReverses aging to youth, withered willow revives.\n\nThe commentary below states: The \"purple placenta\" refers to the firstborn daughter. Wash it one hundred times in east-flowing water to remove blood, then fifty times in wine; dry in the shade and sun alternately before combining.\n\nEight *liang* of raw dried rehmannia, replenishes marrow and blood.\nFour *liang* of achyranthes, governs the lower back and knees.\nThree *liang* of chrysanthemum, dispels wind in the sinews.\nThree *liang* of schisandra, governs the five viscera.\nThree *liang* of cistanche, aids the male member (women omit this).\nFour *liang* of raspberry, governs insufficiency of yin.\nTwo *liang* of morinda root (add one *liang* for those desiring many worldly affairs; women omit this).\nThree *liang* of chebule peel, governs qi in the chest.\nTwo *liang* of *guzi* flower, strengthens sinews and bones.\nTwo *liang* of *kudan*, treats all toxic drugs.\nThree *liang* of licorice.\nThree *liang* of grass-leaved sweetflag, augments spirit and essence.\nThree *liang* of dried lacquer, dispels wind-sand from the muscles and five viscera, turning them yellow.\nThree *liang* of biota seeds, replenishes essence.\nThree *liang* of poria, calms the spirit.\nThree *liang* of *yunying* powder, astringes the intestines.\nTwo *liang* of Solomon’s seal, supplements the spleen and stomach.\nTwo *liang* of noble dendrobium, augments the sinews.\nThree *liang* of alisma, supplements men and women.\nTwo *liang* of polygala, augments heart-power and prevents forgetfulness.\nFour *liang* of apricot kernels, stir-fried until scorched, remove tips and skins, dispels malign blood and qi.\nFour *liang* of sesame, prolongs years and preserves form and spirit.\n\nGrind the twenty-two ingredients into powder, form honeyed pills. Take three doses, and the complexion will resemble a young girl’s.\n\nFormerly transmitted by Su Linzi; to transmit, swear a blood oath—otherwise, the Most High will impose penalties.\n\n**Xun Guitai Wangmu’s Four Youths Powder**\nSeven *liang* of cinnabar.\nThree *liang* of cinnabar (as above).\nFour *liang* of sesame.\nFour *liang* of asparagus root.\nFive *liang* of poria.\nThree *liang* of atractylodes.\nFive *liang* of dried Solomon’s seal.\nFour *liang* of peach kernels, remove tips and skins.\n\nCombine and pound thirty thousand times. In winter, take as powder; in summer, form into pills. After eight years of use, the complexion will resemble an infant’s, the skin like congealed fat.\n\nFormerly transmitted by Mao Ai; swear an oath before passing it on. Those who violate this will be penalized by the Most High. Be cautious, be cautious!\n\n**Li Pengjun’s Deer Antler Powder**\nThree or two sets of deer antlers, quantity not strictly limited.\nSplit open, cut into pieces three *fen* thick and five *cun* long; remove the core and impurities, then soak in rice-water vinegar.\nChange the solution every three days in summer, every ten days in winter; after a month, when the antlers soften, steam them in rice, cover with mulberry bark, and wait until they become as soft as taro. Dry in the sun, then grind into powder. For each *jin*, add one *liang* of sublimed sulfur.\n\nDeer feed on sweetflag, and its essence enters the antlers.\n\nPengjun took this formula and lived 779 years before ascending to Mount Difu, disappearing without a trace. Today’s claim that Peng passed away is false—there is a separate account of this.\n\nSomeone obtained this formula from a stone cave on Mount Heming and swore never to divulge it.\n\n**Dui Xiaji’s Apricot Gold Elixir**\nSix *dou* of apricot kernels, ground in water to yield one *shi* and eight *dou* of liquid. Place in an iron cauldron, first coating it with three *jin* of sheep fat until fully absorbed. Then add the apricot liquid and simmer over a straw fire for forty-nine days. Remove and refine with *buzi*, forming pills the size of soybeans. Take one pill daily; three *liang* make one dose.\n\nXiaji took three doses, becoming a young maiden with hair as white as frost, ascending in broad daylight. The formula comes from the *Upper Canon of Xianmenzi*. Swear an oath before transmitting it—violation will bring calamity to seven generations. Be cautious, be cautious!\n\n**Kan Nanyue Zhenren Chisongzi’s Lycium Decoction**\nThirty *jin* of lycium roots; remove the bark and set aside. Steam and sun-dry it nine times, then grind into powder. Boil the root cores, adding up to three *shi* of water. Later, combine and decoct until the consistency of thin congee, then mix with the earlier powder to form pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take one dose to live as long as a hundred years.\n\nThis formula was transmitted by Li Babai; swear an oath before passing it on—heavenly calamity will punish violators.\n\n**Zhen Qingjing Xiansheng’s Swift Rice Formula**\nOne *shi* of white millet, soaked in *nan zhu* juice. Steam and sun-dry it nine times until reduced to over three *dou*. Cook one spoonful daily; after a month, reduce to half a spoonful; after two months, to one-third. The intestines will transform into sinews, and wind-cold cannot harm you. Beard and temples will turn black as silk, the complexion like ice and jade.\n\nThis formula was transmitted to a palace maiden who took it, commanding the Six Ding spirits and celestial soldiers as attendants. Keep it secret—attain transcendence. Be most cautious, be most cautious!\n\n**The Supreme Elbow-Behind Jade Scripture Formula Concludes**\n\nAs recorded in the original text as \"遵,\" amended according to *Yunji qiqian*, fascicle 74. The character \"姬\" was originally written as \"门徽书母J,\" which is nonsensical; corrected per *Yunji qiqian*. \"代\" was originally written as \"伐一\"; amended per *Yunji qiqian*. \"青\" was originally written as \"清\"; corrected per *Yunji qiqian*. \"迅\" was originally written as \"辚\"; amended per *Yunji qiqian*.",
