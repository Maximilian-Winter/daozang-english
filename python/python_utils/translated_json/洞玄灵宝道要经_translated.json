One Revered by the Emperor.\n\nWhen the sinful ghosts had sung this song,\nbefore they could receive rebirth,\nthey returned to the tombs.\nNight after night, they appeared in dreams,\nspeaking to their descendants:\n\"If you wish for the living and the dead to attain their desires,\nhasten to burn the incense of the Nine Darknesses,\nestablish pure abodes,\nand abundantly provide beds and

the Great Dao.\nRecite and transmit the scriptural teachings,\nassist the nation and sustain life.\nRescue the orphaned and endangered,\nheal illnesses and epidemics.\nAbide in the One and establish merit,\nexhorting others to do good.\"\n\nAt that time, when ordinary people were moved by these dreams, they awoke with a start from their sleep. Each saw in their courtyards the celestial lamps illuminating brightly, their radiance piercing the heart, and all awakened in profound understanding. They practiced filial piety and upheld the Dao for eighteen years, attaining the six spiritual penetrations. Their deceased ancestors, transformed in the Southern Palace, were all reborn in blessed realms, where they beheld the Dao and heard the Dharma, ascending together to immortal ranks.\n\nThe Dao declares: The virtue of the Dao is vast and great, and filial piety bridges the unseen and the manifest. Sinful ghosts, pardoned, practiced the Dao; descendants, awakened in darkness, practiced filial piety. Those who serve Our Dao must first practice filial piety and only then cultivate the Dao—thus it is called the Filial Dao. In the past, there were those who first cultivated the Dao and only afterward practiced filial piety. The Dao is without birth or extinction, but humans have a beginning and an end. If one cultivates the Dao yet the Dao remains unfulfilled, and one wishes to be filial, their parents may not wait. Because they did not wait, there arises the grief of unending sorrow. This harms harmony and depletes qi, and cannot be called an easy exchange. When one passes forty, signs of decline appear. The practice of abiding in the One is abandoned, and the mourning of the heart is never completed. By sixty, their corpse lies in the tomb. After three years have passed, form and spirit do not disperse. Divine birds spread their wings to cover them, and fierce beasts stand guard in protection.\n\nOn the seventh day of the seventh month, the autumnal equinox festival, the Supreme Heavenly Worthy looked down in compassion. By the autumn equinox, he dispatched a celestial messenger bearing divine cinnabar to descend and rescue them. Upon entering the mouth, they revived as if waking from sleep. The Eight Kings of the Western Palace bestowed upon them a whirlwind chariot. Ascending to the Heavenly Treasury, they were named Filial Immortals. To this day, they endure for ninety thousand great kalpas, their forms like gold and jade, their complexion resembling clouds. Passing from death to life, they abide eternally without end.\n\nWhen the Filial Immortals first began, they endured the hardships of mud and ashes, unchanging through wind and frost, unaltered by hunger and distress. The Dao values the perfection of cinnabar; one must uphold lofty aspirations. Embracing purity and holding fast to integrity, only then may one attain fruition. Seated in a cloud chariot, they soar and float to the upper realms. Even now, in practicing filial piety, they recall their parents, whose boundless great kindness enabled their attainment of the Dao—an inconceivable debt.\n\nIn a past kalpa, there was one who first practiced utmost filial piety. Both parents lived to one hundred and thirty-seven years, while the child had already reached one hundred and five. Skilled in medicines and elixirs, he regularly consumed the radiance of cinnabar. Parents and child alike retained their vigor, their sinews unweakened. Thus, the filial son donned embroidered robes. Proficient in music, he performed songs and dances twice daily to entertain them. When his parents passed away one day, it was as if they had fallen asleep—no pain or distress, their minds undisturbed. The filial son prepared their tomb and interred his parents. Birds and beasts gathered in clouds to assist, carrying soil in their beaks. After three years, the mound rose a hundred feet high.\n\nThereupon, the filial son built a hut and dwelled there for nine years, practicing filial piety and cultivating the Dao. Divine candles illuminated his heart throughout the land. Fragrant officials encircled the tomb, bearing witness to his devotion. Heaven and Earth, his parents, moved by his sincerity, bestowed upon him the intertwined pears. Ascending to the Western Palace, he was granted the title *Golden Radiance Filial Son, Luminous Jade Perfected Youth*. Though he attained the Dao in old age, he reverted to youthfulness. Even as a perfected being, he did not forget the Filial Dao.\n\nHow much more so for ordinary mortals who forget kindness and betray righteousness, who abandon benevolence and virtue—how do they differ from corpses? They rebel against Heaven and Earth, indulging in lust and wine. Greedy and unrighteous, they profit at the expense of others. They devour fish and meat, their mouths stained with fat and blood. Their entire bodies reek of foulness, and they trust in demonic deceptions. Some leave home for profit, falsely claiming to uphold the Dao. They damage merit and virtue, embezzle sacred wealth, and trade in wine and lust, never knowing contentment. When death approaches, they beg for mercy, but their sins are already recorded, and their spirit does not abide. Their minds are confused, their qi scattered, their complexion altered. Though they may repent, the Dao does not pardon. Their hun and po disperse, suffering torment in every realm. Their flesh becomes food for ants, their bones and flesh mingling with the earth. Their five viscera rot away, leaving no trace of human form.\n\nI tell you: if you wish to practice the Filial Dao in your next life, diligently recite the scriptures and admonitions, contemplate your body and mind, and sever all attachments. Once attachments are cut off, afflictions cease. Afflictions arise from craving; if craving is severed, the bonds of birth and death are forever broken without remainder, and body and mind attain bliss. The mind of the Dao expands boundlessly; seven generations of ancestors receive blessings—how could only one’s own self attain the Dao?\n\nThe divine power of the Filial Dao is like that of Heaven and Earth. All that Heaven and Earth generate arises without seed. Only one’s parents cannot be counterfeited. One ought to practice filial piety to repay their great kindness. One ought to cultivate the Dao, observe precepts, and perform deliverance rites, burn incense and light lamps to relieve suffering and peril. When seven generations of ancestors are in distress, they place their hope in their descendants, invoking the divine power of the Dao in hopes of liberation. Like a prisoner shackled in chains, they long for an imperial pardon to wash away their sins, to attain joy and freedom, their hearts free from sorrow.\n\nThe records of sins in the unseen and manifest realms differ only in degree. To have sins and receive pardon is not as good as having no sins at all. Though sins may be forgiven, their mark remains. Having lost even one virtue, one’s integrity is forever compromised. Thus, life must not be squandered, nor the Dao forgotten. To forget the Dao and lose life is to be called a sinful ghost, not a human.\n\nTo forget the Dao and lose life is to drift with circumstances, endlessly turning without cease. Like drifting on a vast sea, unaware of its boundaries, longing to return to familiar shores, one is tossed by wind and waves, forever losing the way back. Those who lose the Dao of life are likewise lost. While still strong and healthy, with difficult tasks yet to accomplish, why not practice filial piety and cultivate the supreme Dao, forever severing the causes of birth, death, and affliction?\n\nThe Dao says: Those who hear my Dao are worthy; those who practice my Dao are perfected beings.\n\nAt that time, the Immortal King composed a verse:\n*To know the Filial Dao’s grandeur,*\n*Every hall is filled with maidens fair.*\n*In the Western Palace’s chambers bright,*\n*They await their turn to serve as kings and lords.*\n*When my Dao prevails,*\n*Heavenly lamps shine everywhere.*\n*Divine incense illumines clear awareness,*\n*Auspicious clouds arise o’er hills and plains.*\n*Hostile nations lay down their arms,*\n*The four seas cease their wars.*\n*Those who uphold the Filial Dao’s precepts*\n*Shall soon behold the Great Peace.*\n\nThe Dao says: The Dao does not cultivate people; people must cultivate the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally natural; it does not cultivate the human Dao. Humans are not natural; thus, they must strive with diligence. In cultivating the natural Dao, among the thirty-six thousand essential teachings, the Filial Dao is the foundation. None who are unkind and unfilial, who rebel against parents or murder their lords, have ever attained the Dao. Those who are disloyal and unfilial are called the Ten Evil Ones. In life, they violate royal law; in death, they enter hell. They endure trials in life and death without hope of release, falling into the realm of hungry ghosts.\n\nThe Dao says: Utmost filial piety in cultivating the Dao is cultivating the Filial Dao. The Dao resides in utmost filial piety; unfiliality is not the Dao. Why is this so? Filial piety engenders compassion, filial piety fosters forbearance, filial piety inspires diligence, filial piety endures hardship, filial piety upholds firm integrity, filial piety subdues all demonic affairs. Wealth, sex, wine, meat, fame, and glory—these are the snares of the world.\n\nThose who contend through plunder and strife, who engage in armed conflict and slaughter—\nthe truly filial remain unmoved, their hearts at peace.\nAbiding in oneness without wavering, all demonic affairs naturally subside.\nFilial devotion forges an iron barrier, sealing the path of death;\nthus, all demonic bridges and crossings are severed.\nWithin and without, all is still—devoted solely to the Way of Filial Piety.\nNo internal strife arises, no external foes lie in ambush.\nThe Way of Filial Piety is formless, beyond all grasping at appearances.\nThe Way of Filial Piety is vast and boundless, beyond all abandonment of form.\nTo grasp or abandon form is to lack true responsiveness;\nonly in non-grasping and non-abandonment does the inexhaustible treasury manifest.\nFor the inexhaustible treasury admits neither grasping nor abandoning;\nto grasp or abandon is to invite exhaustion and weariness.\nExhaustion is not the Dao; weariness is not filial piety.\nNeither exhausted nor weary—this is the true Way of Filial Piety.\nFilial piety is like breath: qi must not cease.\nTo cease qi is to perish; to cease filial piety is to fail the Dao.\nWith each breath, each thought—whether in movement, stillness, or recollection—\nevery moment must dwell in the heart, never to be forsaken.\nTo forsake it is to fail the Dao; thus, it must never be abandoned.\n\nThe Dao says: Those who wish to bear sons and daughters and seek the Way of Filial Piety\nmust not seek it for profit, nor seek it for desire.\nProfit gives rise to deluded greed; deluded greed is not the Dao.\nDesire gives rise to jealousy and envy, the roots of all suffering,\nwhich flourish through desire.\nJealousy is not virtue; suffering is not the Dao.\nTo seek the Dao through desire is to fail in attaining it.\nThe Dao is not found in sacrifices, nor in wine and meat.\nThe pursuit of the Dao is inherently pure; it cannot be defiled by negligence.\nThe Way of Filial Piety is sought without attachment, not through worldly wisdom.\nThe Great Dao is formless; it cannot be sought through appearances.\nThose who seek the Dao should do so with a mind of non-attainment.\nNeither seek with the mind of the past, nor with the mind of the future.\nSeek with a mind neither arising nor ceasing,\nwith a mind of secrecy,\nwith a mind of vastness,\nwith a mind of sincerity,\nwith a mind of forbearance and diligence,\nwith a mind of stillness and gentleness,\nwith a mind of compassion and utmost filial piety.\nThese are but brief outlines of the Dao’s essentials; by analogy, the rest may be inferred.\nIn time, clarity will come of itself.\n\nThen, the True King briefly expounded the essentials of the Dao for all beings,\ndisseminating and venerating its teachings.\nThose who attain it recite and contemplate it day and night,\ncultivating its practices with diligence.\nThus, their hearts attain the Dao in ways beyond conception.\n\n*The Essential Teachings of the Dao of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "At that time, when ordinary people were moved by these dreams, they awoke with a start from their sleep. Each saw in their courtyards the celestial lamps illuminating brightly, their radiance piercing the heart, and all awakened in profound understanding. They practiced filial piety and upheld the Dao for eighteen years, attaining the six spiritual penetrations. Their deceased ancestors, transformed in the Southern Palace, were all reborn in blessed realms, where they beheld the Dao and heard the Dharma, ascending together to immortal ranks.\n\nThe Dao declares: The virtue of the Dao is vast and great, and filial piety bridges the unseen and the manifest. Sinful ghosts, pardoned, practiced the Dao; descendants, awakened in darkness, practiced filial piety. Those who serve Our Dao must first practice filial piety and only then cultivate the Dao—thus it is called the Filial Dao. In the past, there were those who first cultivated the Dao and only afterward practiced filial piety. The Dao is without birth or extinction, but humans have a beginning and an end. If one cultivates the Dao yet the Dao remains unfulfilled, and one wishes to be filial, their parents may not wait. Because they did not wait, there arises the grief of unending sorrow. This harms harmony and depletes qi, and cannot be called an easy exchange. When one passes forty, signs of decline appear. The practice of abiding in the One is abandoned, and the mourning of the heart is never completed. By sixty, their corpse lies in the tomb. After three years have passed, form and spirit do not disperse. Divine birds spread their wings to cover them, and fierce beasts stand guard in protection.",

      "translated_text": "On the seventh day of the seventh month, the autumnal equinox festival, the Supreme Heavenly Worthy looked down in compassion. By the autumn equinox, he dispatched a celestial messenger bearing divine cinnabar to descend and rescue them. Upon entering the mouth, they revived as if waking from sleep. The Eight Kings of the Western Palace bestowed upon them a whirlwind chariot. Ascending to the Heavenly Treasury, they were named Filial Immortals. To this day, they endure for ninety thousand great kalpas, their forms like gold and jade, their complexion resembling clouds. Passing from death to life, they abide eternally without end.\n\nWhen the Filial Immortals first began, they endured the hardships of mud and ashes, unchanging through wind and frost, unaltered by hunger and distress. The Dao values the perfection of cinnabar; one must uphold lofty aspirations. Embracing purity and holding fast to integrity, only then may one attain fruition. Seated in a cloud chariot, they soar and float to the upper realms. Even now, in practicing filial piety, they recall their parents, whose boundless great kindness enabled their attainment of the Dao—an inconceivable debt.\n\nIn a past kalpa, there was one who first practiced utmost filial piety. Both parents lived to one hundred and thirty-seven years, while the child had already reached one hundred and five. Skilled in medicines and elixirs, he regularly consumed the radiance of cinnabar. Parents and child alike retained their vigor, their sinews unweakened. Thus, the filial son donned embroidered robes. Proficient in music, he performed songs and dances twice daily to entertain them. When his parents passed away one day, it was as if they had fallen asleep—no pain or distress, their minds undisturbed. The filial son prepared their tomb and interred his parents. Birds and beasts gathered in clouds to assist, carrying soil in their beaks. After three years, the mound rose a hundred feet high.\n\nThereupon, the filial son built a hut and dwelled there for nine years, practicing filial piety and cultivating the Dao. Divine candles illuminated his heart throughout the land. Fragrant officials encircled the tomb, bearing witness to his devotion. Heaven and Earth, his parents, moved by his sincerity, bestowed upon him the intertwined pears. Ascending to the Western Palace, he was granted the title *Golden Radiance Filial Son, Luminous Jade Perfected Youth*. Though he attained the Dao in old age, he reverted to youthfulness. Even as a perfected being, he did not forget the Filial Dao.\n\nHow much more so for ordinary mortals who forget kindness and betray righteousness, who abandon benevolence and virtue—how do they differ from corpses? They rebel against Heaven and Earth, indulging in lust and wine. Greedy and unrighteous, they profit at the expense of others. They devour fish and meat, their mouths stained with fat and blood. Their entire bodies reek of foulness, and they trust in demonic deceptions. Some leave home for profit, falsely claiming to uphold the Dao. They damage merit and virtue, embezzle sacred wealth, and trade in wine and lust, never knowing contentment. When death approaches, they beg for mercy, but their sins are already recorded, and their spirit does not abide. Their minds are confused, their qi scattered, their complexion altered. Though they may repent, the Dao does not pardon. Their hun and po disperse, suffering torment in every realm. Their flesh becomes food for ants, their bones and flesh mingling with the earth. Their five viscera rot away, leaving no trace of human form.\n\nI tell you: if you wish to practice the Filial Dao in your next life, diligently recite the scriptures and admonitions, contemplate your body and mind, and sever all attachments. Once attachments are cut off, afflictions cease. Afflictions arise from craving; if craving is severed, the bonds of birth and death are forever broken without remainder, and body and mind attain bliss. The mind of the Dao expands boundlessly; seven generations of ancestors receive blessings—how could only one’s own self attain the Dao?\n\nThe divine power of the Filial Dao is like that of Heaven and Earth. All that Heaven and Earth generate arises without seed. Only one’s parents cannot be counterfeited. One ought to practice filial piety to repay their great kindness. One ought to cultivate the Dao, observe precepts, and perform deliverance rites, burn incense and light lamps to relieve suffering and peril. When seven generations of ancestors are in distress, they place their hope in their descendants, invoking the divine power of the Dao in hopes of liberation. Like a prisoner shackled in chains, they long for an imperial pardon to wash away their sins, to attain joy and freedom, their hearts free from sorrow.\n\nThe records of sins in the unseen and manifest realms differ only in degree. To have sins and receive pardon is not as good as having no sins at all. Though sins may be forgiven, their mark remains. Having lost even one virtue, one’s integrity is forever compromised. Thus, life must not be squandered, nor the Dao forgotten. To forget the Dao and lose life is to be called a sinful ghost, not a human.\n\nTo forget the Dao and lose life is to drift with circumstances, endlessly turning without cease. Like drifting on a vast sea, unaware of its boundaries, longing to return to familiar shores, one is tossed by wind and waves, forever losing the way back. Those who lose the Dao of life are likewise lost. While still strong and healthy, with difficult tasks yet to accomplish, why not practice filial piety and cultivate the supreme Dao, forever severing the causes of birth, death, and affliction?\n\nThe Dao says: Those who hear my Dao are worthy; those who practice my Dao are perfected beings.\n\nAt that time, the Immortal King composed a verse:\n*To know the Filial Dao’s grandeur,*\n*Every hall is filled with maidens fair.*\n*In the Western Palace’s chambers bright,*\n*They await their turn to serve as kings and lords.*\n*When my Dao prevails,*\n*Heavenly lamps shine everywhere.*\n*Divine incense illumines clear awareness,*\n*Auspicious clouds arise o’er hills and plains.*\n*Hostile nations lay down their arms,*\n*The four seas cease their wars.*\n*Those who uphold the Filial Dao’s precepts*\n*Shall soon behold the Great Peace.*\n\nThe Dao says: The Dao does not cultivate people; people must cultivate the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally natural; it does not cultivate the human Dao. Humans are not natural; thus, they must strive with diligence. In cultivating the natural Dao, among the thirty-six thousand essential teachings, the Filial Dao is the foundation. None who are unkind and unfilial, who rebel against parents or murder their lords, have ever attained the Dao. Those who are disloyal and unfilial are called the Ten Evil Ones. In life, they violate royal law; in death, they enter hell. They endure trials in life and death without hope of release, falling into the realm of hungry ghosts.\n\nThe Dao says: Utmost filial piety in cultivating the Dao is cultivating the Filial Dao. The Dao resides in utmost filial piety; unfiliality is not the Dao. Why is this so? Filial piety engenders compassion, filial piety fosters forbearance, filial piety inspires diligence, filial piety endures hardship, filial piety upholds firm integrity, filial piety subdues all demonic affairs. Wealth, sex, wine, meat, fame, and glory—these are the snares of the world.",
