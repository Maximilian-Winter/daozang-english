  "full_translation": "**Preface to *The Sutra of the Wisdom-Life***\n*by Liu Huayang of the Qing Dynasty*\n\nI, Huayang, am a native of Hongdu. From childhood, I was drawn to the Buddha. Entering a monastic sanctuary, I gained insight and ever after harbored thoughts of transcending the mundane, rejoicing at the sight of monks. One day, I heard an elder speak of how the Fifth Patriarch secretly transmitted the Dao to the Sixth Patriarch in the third watch of the night. Listening intently, I was overjoyed, as if awakening from a dream. Only then did I realize that those who cultivate the Dao must rely on a master’s transmission, and so I sought without cease.\n\nMy footsteps traversed the lands of Jing and Chu, yet I met no one. Later, I took tonsure at Shuanglian Temple by the Wan River, redoubling my inquiries. I studied under masters of the Three Teachings, yet none fully grasped the essence of the *wisdom-life*. Sighing to myself, I thought: *\"The human form is hard to attain—shall I fritter it away in vain?\"* Suddenly, a resolve arose: each night at the second watch, I prostrated myself in full devotion, vowing to Heaven that I would not rest until I found the Way.\n\nAfter half a year, I was fortunate to meet Master He Wu Chongxu, who transmitted to me the secret teachings. In an instant, I awakened, realizing that the Dao of *wisdom-life* is none other than the innate spiritual essence within me. Later, at Mount Lu, I encountered Master Huyun. Listening to his discourse, I knew him to be no ordinary man. With earnest devotion and humble entreaties, I entreated him, and he, in his boundless compassion, unveiled the profound and subtle mysteries—every inner and outer subtlety was made perfectly clear.\n\nAs I prepared to depart, my master exhorted me: *\"The dual cultivation of the Buddha’s teaching has now perished. You must continue its lifeblood to ferry those with karmic affinity.\"* I withdrew to the lands east of the Yangtze, where, with two or three fellow Daoists, I burned incense and delved deeply into practice. Witnessing Bichan’s arduous cultivation—how through jade-like true essence he had already formed *śarīra*—I silently aligned with my master’s transmission. Thus, I compiled this text, titling it *The Sutra of the Wisdom-Life*, illustrating it with diagrams to reveal the ancient Buddha’s secrets and disclose the primordial mechanism of the patriarchs. Truly, it is a raft and ladder for guiding later learners.\n\nI have observed that those who seek the Dao often venerate recorded sayings, yet among these, some are true and some are false. Those of lesser learning, unaware of the Tathāgata’s *wisdom-life* Dao, mistakenly enter the trap of formulaic Chan, remaining mired in ignorance and ultimately harmed by these very records. Having thoroughly studied the sutras and verified them against my masters’ transmissions, I affirm: the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, and the *Platform Sūtra* are true teachings. The recorded sayings of Chan masters and abbots, however, are false.\n\nThe path of cultivation demands truth to authenticate its true principles and to dispel delusion. When delusion prevails, demonic obstacles arise, and even the wise and sagacious find no entry. For a thousand years, the Dao of *wisdom-life* has been closely guarded, transmitted only in secret, rarely glimpsed. Now, in these humble words, I lay bare the transmission of the Buddha’s treasure, offering it in full. May those who study this *Sutra of the Wisdom-Life* feel as though they have received it directly from a master’s lips. With diligent effort and unwavering resolve, they need not seek aid elsewhere—the fruition of Buddhahood can be realized at once. This is the very aspiration that drove me to seek a master and awaken to the Dao.\n\nWritten in the summer of the *jiayin* year of the Qianlong reign, by Liu Huayang of Chuanlu, Hukou, at Zhongjie Hermitage in Wan City.\n\n**Diagram of the Exhaustion of the Water Clock (First)**\nThe subtlety of the Dao is nowhere more profound than in *nature* and *life*.\n\nThe cultivation of *nature* and *life* is nothing so profound as returning to the One. The ancient sages and lofty worthies, in expounding the principle of uniting *nature* and *life*, often employed clever metaphors drawn from external things, yet never dared to state it plainly and directly. Thus, in the world, there have been none who practiced the dual cultivation of both. My continuation of these diagrams is not an act of reckless disclosure. Rather, it follows the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s teaching on the exhaustion of the water clock, reveals the wondrous purport of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, and gathers the scattered words of the various scriptures to return them to the correct diagram. Only then does one realize that the *wisdom-life* is found nowhere outside this *aperture*.\n\nMoreover, the purpose of this diagram is to enable those of like aspiration to understand this celestial mechanism of dual cultivation, lest they fall into heterodox paths. Only then will they know that the true seed is conceived here, the exhaustion of the water clock is accomplished here, the *śarīra* is refined here, and the great Dao is perfected here. This aperture is a cavern of emptiness and nothingness, formless and shadowless. When *qi* arises, it becomes an opening; when the mechanism ceases, it vanishes into obscurity—this is the abode where the true is concealed. The altar for cultivating the *wisdom-life* is called the Dragon Palace at the Ocean’s Bottom, the Realm of Snow Mountain, the Western Paradise, the Primordial Pass, the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Homeland of the Boundless. Though the names are many, they all refer to this single aperture. If cultivators do not understand this aperture, then through countless kalpas and myriad rebirths, the *wisdom-life* will remain nowhere to be found.\n\nHow vast is this aperture! Before one’s parents gave birth to this body, at the moment of conception, this aperture was the first to form, and *nature* and *life* truly resided within it. The two merged and became one, harmonious and flourishing, like a spark in a furnace—a single mass of primordial harmony and celestial principle. Thus it is said: “In the prenatal state, there are boundless transformations.” Thus it is said: “Before one’s parents were born, when *qi* was full and the embryo complete, the body moved and the sac burst—like a man slipping from a high mountain, with a resounding *kacha!*—and *nature* and *life* were divided into two.” From that moment onward, *nature* could no longer see *life*, nor *life* see *nature*. From youth to maturity, from maturity to old age, from old age to death.\n\nTherefore, the Tathāgata, in great compassion, revealed the method of cultivation to save beings, enabling them to re-enter the womb and recreate their *nature* and *life*. They guide their spirit and *qi* into this aperture, uniting the two into one to conceive the embryo—its principle is one and the same. Within the aperture resides the sovereign fire; at its gate lies the ministerial fire; throughout the body burns the common fire. When the sovereign fire arises, the ministerial fire responds; when the ministerial fire moves, the common fire follows. If the three fires proceed in harmony, a human is formed; if the three fires return in reverse, the Dao is attained. Thus, the aperture of the exhausted water clock is the origin from which both ordinary beings and sages arise. To cultivate anything other than this path is of no benefit. Yet among the thousand schools and myriad teachings, none know that within this aperture resides the sovereign of the *wisdom-life*. Seeking externally, they exhaust their minds in vain and achieve nothing.\n\n**Diagram of the Dharma-Wheel’s Six Phases (Second)**\nThe wondrous function of the Dao is none other than the Dharma-wheel. Its movement is unhindered, like a road; its speed varies, like a rule; its limits are precise, like a measure. This diagram is complete in its methods, and the true visage of the Western transmission is fully contained herein. Its profound practices—none surpass the breath; its ebb and flow—none surpass opening and closing; its path—none surpass true intention; its boundaries—none surpass the realm of action. Setting aside the self to follow others, this diagram fully reveals the celestial mechanism. Even the foolish and vulgar, if they obtain it, will attain success. Yet without virtue, even if one encounters the Dao, Heaven will not uphold it. Why? Virtue and the Dao are like a bird’s wings—lacking one, they are of no use. One must first perfect loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, righteousness, and the Five Precepts in their entirety before any hope may be held. The subtle and wondrous mysteries within are all contained in the *Sutra of the Wisdom-Life*. Comparing the two, nothing will fail to be grasped in its truth.\n\n**Diagram of the Ren and Du Meridians (Third)**\nThis diagram is one with the previous two. Why then is it drawn again? It is to prevent cultivators from remaining ignorant of the pathways of the Dharma-wheel within their own bodies. Thus, this diagram is provided to enlighten those of like aspiration. If one can unblock these two meridians, then all the meridians will be unblocked. The deer, when sleeping, inserts its nose into its anus to unblock the *Du* meridian; the crane and the tortoise unblock the *Ren* meridian. These three creatures all attain a lifespan of a thousand years—how much more so for humans! Cultivators who turn the Dharma-wheel to circulate the *wisdom-life*—how could they not attain longevity and fulfill their Daoist practice?\n\n**Diagram of the Dao-Embryo (Fourth)**\nThis diagram reveals the wondrous purport originally contained in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*. Common monks, not understanding the Dao-embryo, were merely unaware due to the absence of such diagrams in the past. Now, through this explication, cultivators will know that the Tathāgata possessed the true practice of the Dao-embryo. The embryo is not some separate thing with form and appearance; it is truly one’s spirit and *qi*. First, the spirit enters the *qi*; then the *qi* comes to envelop the spirit. Spirit and *qi* intertwine, and intention becomes utterly still—this is what is called the embryo. Only when *qi* congeals does the spirit become numinous. Thus, the scripture says: “Personally attend to the responsive awakening, and nurture the two *qi*.” Thus it says: “Day by day, it grows; when *qi* is full and the embryo complete, it emerges from the crown—this is what is called forming and emerging from the embryo, becoming the true child of the Buddha.”\n\n**Diagram of Emerging from the Embryo (Fifth)**\nThe *Śūraṅgama Dhāraṇī* states: “At that time, the World-Honored One emitted a hundred-jeweled light from his flesh-topknot. From within the light emerged a thousand-petaled jeweled lotus, upon which sat a transformed Tathāgata. From his crown radiated ten streams of hundred-jeweled light, all manifesting universally. The great assembly gazed upward as the radiant Tathāgata proclaimed the divine incantation.” This is the emergence of the yang-spirit. Thus, it is called the Buddha’s child. If one does not attain the Dao of *wisdom-life* and merely practices desiccated Chan, how can one’s own body be realized? How then could one deem the World-Honored One’s teaching a lesser path?\n\nThis reveals the secret of the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, enlightening later learners. Those who attain this Dao immediately transcend the sacred realm and do not fall into the dust of the mundane.\n\n**Diagram of the Transformed Body (Sixth)**\n**Diagram of Wall-Gazing (Seventh)**\n**Diagram of Shattering the Void (Eighth)**\n**Collected Sayings on the Sūtra of Wisdom-Life (Ninth)**\n\nHuayang states: To become a Buddha or an Ancestor is to realize the luminous nature of one’s original essence. Without attaining the Dao of *wisdom-life* and exhausting the leaks, one cannot fully awaken to the Way, nor directly enter the vast emptiness of the Tathāgata. Now, this luminous nature of the original essence, though it bears two names, springs from a single source. In samādhi, it is called *nature*; in the wisdom-illumination of samādhi, it is called *light*. *Wisdom-life* is the name the Tathāgata originally employed to instruct people. It is a Sanskrit term from the Western Regions, yet it is the very root of the Chinese people. The Confucians call it *precelestial qi*. It is the boat and ladder of Buddhist cultivation, the lever and handle of Ancestral attainment—precisely what Mencius meant by “nurturing the vast and flowing qi.”\n\n*Exhausting the leaks* is the name the World-Honored One used to describe the practice he demonstrated to Ānanda. It too is a Sanskrit term from the Western Regions. In China, it is called *leakage*; the Confucians call it *loss of essence*; physicians call it *dissipation of primordial qi*. Now, *exhausting the leaks* is the transformation of *wisdom-life*. Before it stirs, it is fundamentally *life*; when it stirs and one fails to refine it, upon exiting the pass it becomes the tangible *exhaustion of leaks*. Thus, the Confucians say *qi transforms into essence*. In the time of youthful purity, when the body is firm and unyielding, there is originally no name for *exhausting the leaks*. Round as a pearl, radiant as a flame—if at this time one encounters a true teacher, there is no need for the method of *exhausting the leaks*. One need only gather this round, radiant *wisdom-life* back into the central palace, constantly awakening, moment by moment illuminating, guarding and nurturing it for ten months. The Dao-embryo is cultivated, the Buddha-body formed—precisely what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* means by: “Having roamed the Dao-embryo, one personally attends the awakened response. With merit diligently accumulated and qi fully replete, one naturally emerges from the embryo.” At this stage, the Dharma-body is vast—precisely what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* means by: “Having formed and emerged from the embryo, one becomes the true child of the Buddha.” This is called the *sudden method*.\n\nHowever, after the age of sixteen, when the treasure of life is full, it begins to leak of its own accord. From this point onward, one refines it until it is without leakage—thus the Tathāgata calls it *exhausting the leaks*. If those who study the Buddha’s teachings do not humbly seek a teacher to point out the true method of fire-transformation, no matter how many seven-day retreats they undertake, no matter how long they sit in meditation or practice austerities, they will have no assurance of attainment. Without such assurance, how can the Dao ever be realized? Thus, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: “Without seeking this wondrous method, one will never attain bodhi.” Therefore, the Tathāgata, in great compassion, revealed to people the method of beginning practice, of replenishing and adding oil, of restoring the round, radiant *wisdom-life* and returning it to the central palace. This is called the *gradual method*. Thus, the Radiant Tathāgata said: “This old monk can graft a rootless tree and relight a lamp at the bottom of the sea.” Yet one must diligently cultivate—it is not something that can be accomplished in a single morning or evening. Thus, the World-Honored One told Ānanda: “The first *exhaustion of leaks* is difficult to achieve.” And *exhausting the leaks* is another name the Buddha used as a metaphor—it is the method of cultivating *wisdom-life* in this text.\n\nIf one cultivates *nature* but not *life*, habitual tendencies will be difficult to eradicate. Even if one reaches the state of vast and boundless emptiness, one will be nothing more than a ghost with the five supernatural powers, unable to align with the Tathāgata’s six supernatural powers. Therefore, the *Mahāvaipulya Mahāsannipāta Sūtra* states: “Those who cultivate the five supernatural powers, even after having cultivated them and nearly attained the *exhaustion of leaks*, do not realize it. Why? Out of compassion for sentient beings, they relinquish the *exhaustion of leaks* attainment and remain in the realm of ordinary beings.”\n\nThe *vast emptiness* is the ultimate void of the Dharma-nature’s perfection. Thus, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: “Nature is like empty space”—precisely what Shaozi meant by: “The Dao extends beyond the forms of heaven and earth; thought enters the transformations of wind and clouds.” Yet without the wind-and-fire method of refining *wisdom-life* and *exhausting the leaks*, one cannot harmonize and coalesce them to accomplish the great Dao. *Wind* is what fans the flames of fire. *Fire* is what transforms things through its power. Thus, the Tathāgata said: “A gentle wind stirs.” And again: “After fire-transformation, gather the relics.” When wind, fire, and *exhausting the leaks* are employed together, they naturally harmonize and coalesce to accomplish the great Dao.\n\nThus, the true transmission of the Buddha’s method follows a sequential order of practice—how could it lack evidence? The true Dao possesses a true sequence of practice. If one mixes up the order, it is not the Dao of the Tathāgata but merely a heterodox side-path. Now, this sequence is as follows: At the beginning, there is the work of harmonizing the true seed; when turning the hand, there is the work of refining the relics; when completing the hand, there is the work of nurturing the Dao-embryo; when releasing the hand, there is the work of emerging from the embryo and wall-gazing—such are the methods. Yet this sequence is not idly discussed. It is gathered from the secret texts of the Buddhas and Ancestors, compiled step by step as evidence. Beneath each phrase, a note is added to clarify it for fellow practitioners. In summary, there is no error in its verification. How could a mere word or half a phrase suffice as the Dao?\n\nNowadays in the Chan school, those who have not even received the true transmission presumptuously instruct others. Some speak of “before parents were born,” others ask, “Who is reciting the Buddha’s name?” These are nothing but the babbling of old women, deceiving the foolish men and women of the world. They wander east and west, calling it “seeking the Buddha’s Dharma,” only to end up empty-handed in old age. How can this be considered the Dao? Those of aspiration, observe this: it is truly *old-woman Chan*, *lip-service Chan*, *contention Chan*, *superficial Chan*, *livelihood Chan*. From ancient times to the present, none have not blindly led the blind, entrapping countless sincere devotees, sinking them into the nine springs, never to emerge and behold the radiance of the Buddha.\n\nFor the Buddha-Dharma first entered China during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, though Buddhist monks had already arrived in the time of the First Emperor of Qin—only to be sent away and not adopted. Since the Han dynasty, countless distortions and falsehoods have arisen. Fortunately, Bodhidharma came to this land to correct these errors, transmitting the great lineage through a single thread. From the Sixth Patriarch to the present, however, deviations have only compounded upon deviations, giving rise to ninety-six heterodox schools and twenty-four misguided practices. Among these, the *seven-day intensive retreat* alone is a poison harming people, a fiery pit burying them alive.\n\nThe Western transmission of the Buddhist teaching spans twenty-eight patriarchs, and the six generations in the East originally knew nothing of this practice. It was fabricated by the disciples of Gaofeng, who themselves followed the misguided method of breath suppression—a mere byway, not the true path of the Tathāgata.\n\nSomeone may ask: How can this be known?\nThe answer lies in Gaofeng’s own words: “Enduring hunger, Shouchang, Jinsu.” Observe those who engage in the *seven-day retreat*—each one spits blood, not only failing to attain the great Dao but instead contracting consumptive illness, suffering miserably unto death. Is this not grievous? These people do not even understand the qi, blood, meridians, and collaterals of the human body—how could they possibly comprehend the Dao?\n\nWhen a person labors during the day, they rely entirely on the stillness of night to calm the spirit, allowing the postnatal heart and kidneys to harmonize. This is the root of nourishing the body. To claim that forcing people to remain awake for seven days and nights without sleep is the great Dao—how could this not lead to illness? Physicians say: If a person goes seven nights without sleep, the heart and kidneys cannot harmonize, and consumptive illness will surely follow—how much worse for forty-nine days? And on top of this, their spine is struck, their organs injured. Alas!\n\nAfter this punishment was abolished by the Tang Emperor, it has not dared to be recklessly employed to this day. The Emperor, upon witnessing that nine out of ten subjected to this penalty perished, consulted various medical texts, which stated that the five viscera all possess meridians and collaterals, connected to the spine’s main network, through which qi and blood circulate—this being the foundation of their movement and nourishment. A single strike to this region obstructs the flow of qi and blood, causing them to reverse and ascend, against which even the greatest physicians like Bian Que or Lu Yi would be powerless to save. Thus, the punishment was commuted to caning the buttocks.\n\nYet some, appending the names of certain monks to the yellow silk cords, claim this as \"transmission of the Dharma,\" deceiving the world with falsehoods upon falsehoods, entrapping beginners, and flooding the world with so-called \"Chan sayings\" from oral records. Even those of earnest aspiration find no path to pursue. They assume the Buddhas and Patriarchs are all born enlightened, yet they too waste away in vain, turning the radiance of the Buddha into darkness.\n\nThe treasury of the Great Canon is complete in its essential teachings, but because early disciples varied in depth of understanding and sharpness of capacity, and because later teachings became entangled with earlier ones, they refused to follow the sequential progression of the stages. Moreover, the Great Canon’s teachings encompass expedient methods, definitive methods, non-action, and action—how could they be discussed as one and the same? It depends entirely on whether one studies or not.\n\nThe Way of cultivating both nature and life resides within these teachings. Yet the later Patriarchs, having attained realization, refused to disclose their insights indiscriminately. Those who received transmission and succeeded did not reveal it openly to the masses, using expedient methods to subdue worldly monks, testing their awakening to prevent distractions and wayward thoughts. Those who truly awakened to the definitive method were given private, secret transmission—hence the \"special transmission outside the teachings,\" communicating only the essential message.\n\nFor instance, the World-Honored One did not transmit to his cousin Ānanda but privately entrusted Mahākāśyapa as the Second Patriarch. The Fifth Patriarch did not transmit to the head monk Shenxiu but secretly passed it to the attendant Huineng as the Sixth Patriarch. Thus, the great treasure of becoming a Buddha or Patriarch is never transmitted to the unworthy. Only those with aspirations surpassing even the Buddhas and Patriarchs, who comprehend the principles beyond, are deemed fit to receive it. The secrets of the Buddha-Dharma are therefore difficult for the world to inquire into, which is why they are not discussed openly or uniformly.\n\nSome manifest in non-action while concealing action. Non-action here refers to the method of nurturing the Dao-embryo after the period of wall-facing, not the mere \"dry sitting\" of non-action practiced by worldly monks. Action, on the other hand, refers to the coalescence and harmonization of the pre-celestial intent-qi, the wondrous functioning of cultivating the wisdom-life in the first half of the path—grounded in evidence, not the mundane action of the world.\n\nThus, the *Ratnakūṭa Sūtra* states: \"All dharmas are like illusions, yet within them there is one dharma, coalesced and harmonized, that surely comes to fruition.\" Another scriptural verse says:\n*\"Bodhisattvas cultivate the gate of liberation,\nTurning ever more toward compassion to seek the Buddha-Dharma.\nKnowing all conditioned things arise from harmony,\nThey delight in determination and diligently practice the Way.\"*\n\nYet another sutra states: \"The Two Vehicles fall into the vast and deep pit of non-action, unable to transcend and realize fruition.\" An ancient master said: \"Though action is provisional, abandoning it prevents the completion of merit and practice. Though non-action is real, pursuing it makes the attainment of sagehood difficult.\"\n\nToday’s Chan schools, upon hearing of action, dismiss it as attachment to form and reject it, unaware that this action is the wondrous action within stillness and concentration. Consider how heaven and earth are non-action, yet their generation of the myriad things is action. The supreme vehicle of the Buddha-Dharma operates likewise.\n\nWhen the human mind reaches the state of non-action, an entity within suddenly transcends and emerges. If one does not consciously grasp it, this entity scatters into external conditions, no longer belonging to oneself. This method of grasping and returning is thus called the \"method of action\"—just as the Sixth Patriarch spoke of \"going north to receive and deliver.\"\n\nSome manifest as \"no-thing\" while concealing \"thing.\" \"No-thing\" refers to the nature-work of the latter half of the path; \"thing\" refers to the life-work of the first half. Today’s false Chan and Daoist practitioners, upon hearing of \"thing,\" invariably reject it, unaware that this \"thing\" is the root of the Dao, the bridge of the Dharma, inherently possessed by all. It is not a product of thought but the entity within the Mysterious Pass.\n\nThus, the Sixth Patriarch said: \"I have a thing, without head or tail, without name or character, without back or front.\" To his successor, he said:\n*\"There is a thing prior to heaven and earth,\nNameless, originally quiescent and empty.\nIt can be the master of the myriad things,\nUnchanging through the four seasons.\"*\nThis is the pre-celestial thing. It governs the post-celestial, scattering without form or shadow, coalescing into śarīra.\n\nThus, Yuanwu said:\n*\"What is higher than heaven? That which gives birth to heaven.\nWhat is deeper than earth? That which nurtures earth.\nWhat is vaster than empty space? That which encompasses empty space.\nWhat surpasses Buddhas and Patriarchs? That which establishes Buddhas and Patriarchs.\"*\nThis is the root of transformation and nurturance, where self and other share the same path. Hence it is said: \"Self and other share the same great parents\"—this is it.\n\nFollowing the current, it gives birth to humans and things; reversing the flow, it becomes Buddha and Patriarch. Following the current, self and other share the same knowledge; reversing the flow, none but a teacher can comprehend and employ it. Thus, Master Yunfeng said: \"There is a thing that secretly saves people—how unfortunate that people do not know it!\" It is the pre-celestial pure yang, utterly unyielding qi. Scattered, it pervades the entire body; concentrated, it resides in the Mysterious Pass.\n\nThus, Hanzi said:\n*\"How precious is the natural thing,\nUnique and without companion.\nSeek it and it cannot be seen,\nEntering and exiting without door or gate.\nConcentrated, it is within the square inch;\nExtended, it is everywhere.\"*\n\nIf you do not believe and accept it, though you meet, you will not encounter. Vast, it encompasses the Dharma realm; minute, it is as small as a grain of millet or a mote of dust. Thus, Master Yunfeng said: \"Though heaven and earth be gathered into a millet grain’s size, though it be so, it must first harmonize and coalesce before any thing arises.\" The World-Honored One called it the *bodhi* seed; what the dragon girl offered at the *Lotus Sutra* assembly was this very thing.\n\nAt times it manifests in non-action and conceals itself in action. Non-action is the method by which the Patriarchs subdue the masses—this is the lesser vehicle. Action is what the Patriarchs secretly transmit and conceal—this is the supreme vehicle. Common beings without roots cannot believe and accept it, so the World-Honored One said: \"In this defiled and evil world, I have accomplished this difficult task, attained *Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi*, and for all the world preach this hard-to-believe Dharma—this is most difficult.\" He also said: \"Such matters of the World-Honored One are hard for the world to believe. If the Patriarchs were to explain them to those of dull capacity, it would only invite slanderous speech.\" Thus, the *Lotus Sutra* states: \"At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra: Stop, there is no need to speak further. If this matter were spoken, all the gods and humans in the world would be shocked and doubtful.\" And again: \"Only this one fact is true; the other two are not real.\"\n\nMoreover, \"action\" is not the affair of heterodox paths—it is the stirring of the life of wisdom, the movement of the primordial pass that gives rise to things. With my intent I govern it; with breath I draw it in. Harmonizing the true seed, turning the Dharma wheel, gathering, refining—all are the work of intent, breath, and the life of wisdom. Thus it is called \"action.\" The life of wisdom is another name for primordial *qi*. When primordial *qi* arises, if not gathered, how could it not scatter? Thus, Master Xingyang said: \"Advance a step and you lose the principle; retreat a step and you miss the affair\"—this is it.\n\nAt times it manifests in the lesser vehicle and conceals itself in the greater vehicle. The lesser vehicle’s methods are the expedient teachings the Chan masters employ: sitting in meditation, reciting Buddha’s name, studying sutras, planting the karmic roots of good deeds. The greater vehicle’s methods are the secret transmissions the Patriarchs received: the life of wisdom, the exhaustion of the yin of desire—these are the Buddha-fruits of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood. What has been said above is but a general outline.\n\nSome explanations are easy to understand and their analogies shallow; these should be studied section by section with care, not glanced over hastily. Once you have penetrated the meaning without doubt, seek confirmation again, lest you cling to partial views and take your teaching from the mouths of deluded men—how mistaken that would be! The simple and accessible words are the true formula of nature and life. Without receiving the oral instructions, it is difficult to awaken late in life. You must piece together the front and back, thoroughly investigate the stages, and then seek confirmation from a true teacher to avoid wasting this lifetime in vain practice.\n\nWhat is transmitted and certified in today’s monasteries is not the Tathāgata’s true Dharma but the names of certain monks passed down from the \"yellow-robed\" ones—this is called \"Buddha-Dharma.\" To recognize it as such is to err. These are false teachings fabricated by deluded men after the Sixth Patriarch who never received the true transmission, scheming to compete for abbacy. They deceive later students and mislead countless faithful. Since it is not the Buddha-Dharma, it becomes a source of contention.\n\nThus I say:\n*\"To shed the mundane and leave the dust, seek one who has passed through—\nAs the ancients said: ‘To find the path down the mountain, ask one who has come and gone.’\"*\n\nOne who has passed through is one who has received the instructions—whether already accomplished or yet to begin, the instructions are the same.\n\n*\"To cut off desire and awaken to the Dao, a true teacher is precious.\"*\n\nMoreover, cutting off desire is the first precept of the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the bridge to becoming a Buddha. If one who wears the robe and carries the staff—a son of Śākyamuni—does not sever the mechanism of desire yet calls this \"cultivating the Dao,\" would this not be a laughingstock to the noble ones of Confucianism and Daoism? Outwardly, they may appear dignified, but inwardly, they are no different from ordinary beings—truly shameful!\n\nMoreover, in the matter of cutting off desire, without seeking a true teacher, by what method can it be severed? When seeking a teacher, first ask about the beginning of this method—all else is heterodox. No matter how many methods they point to and explain, they will not accord with your body and mind.\n\n*\"Today’s Buddhist teachings—reciting sutras, invoking Buddha’s name, sitting in Chan meditation, holding seven-day retreats, investigating *huatou*—beyond these, there is nothing. These are but yellow leaves to stop a child’s crying—what benefit do they bring to body and mind?\"*\n\n*\"Extravagant talk beyond the norm is not the supreme Dao.\"*\n\nToday’s Buddhists, not having received the true transmission, open their mouths to speak of this bodhisattva or that Buddha, lacking ability themselves and using such grandmotherly talk to deceive the foolish. They say, \"This monk died and attained the Dao; that monk died and attained the great Dao.\" If death alone attains the Dao, then all the corpses in the world would be men of attainment! They do not know that one who has attained the Dao, while alive, can perform transformations without limit—only then is it the supreme Dao.\n\n*\"A single word, subtly pointed, is the good physician.\"*\n\nA single word is honest speech, not lengthy texts or flowery, clever language. Thus the Fifth Patriarch said: \"Master to master, secretly transmit the original sound.\" Subtle pointing is like the Fifth Patriarch’s midnight instruction to the Sixth Patriarch, like the World-Honored One’s pointing to Mahākāśyapa from a boat. For one who has attained the Dao, all doubts and illnesses vanish; the scriptures of the storehouse teachings are all thoroughly understood—thus, a good physician.\n\n*\"Having obtained it, briefly test it from the beginning—\nIn a moment’s effort, the fruit brings its own joy.\"*\n\nOnce you have received the true instructions, begin cultivation from the very start. If it is indeed the Dao, when desire stirs, gather the mind to govern it, use breath to refine it—without even a moment’s effort, the root of desire will retract, intent and *qi* will harmonize, the mind will be still, the body refreshed, and you will secretly rejoice.\n\nMoreover, I have heard it said in the *Heart Sutra*: \"Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva.\" Huayang remarks: This is the critical threshold where the Tathāgata, by celestial grace, teaches the proper method of dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming* at the very outset. Yet how lamentable that ordinary beings, lacking true transmission, mistake mere念念 recitation for \"observing Avalokiteśvara\"—a grievous error. Little do they know that this念念 arises from the seeds of habitual *vijñāna*, not the primordial source of the Dao. Thus, Master Cheng asked: Is this so-called \"correct Dao and settled principle\" truly the heart? Or is it not the heart? Herein lies the profound message urging one to awaken to a different understanding.\n\nNow, \"manifest\" (*xiàn*) and \"bodhisattva\" are the Tathāgata’s sublime metaphors for two entities, the cardinal principle of dual cultivation—how could they be reduced to one? If this念念 were the Dao, then the Dao would be inconstant indeed. Thus, the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* states: \"All sentient beings mistakenly take the four great elements as their bodily form and the shadows of the six sense-objects as their mind.\" The *Primordial Wondrous School* also says: \"The numinous platform of wisdom-nature is the root of birth and death; deluded thoughts and conditioned *qi* arise only from prior sense-objects, giving rise to discrimination.\"\n\nTherefore, the Dharma-transmitting Tathāgata declared: \"Within the Hall of the Empty King, no traces remain. If one takes this as real, then the bodhisattva remains buried ninefold in the earth, unable to emerge and transform, to attain the Tathāgata’s wondrous form, squandering this great causal opportunity in vain.\" Furthermore, this is but the transformation of the *yin-qi* and *shishen* within the heart—through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, it has ever been thus. The bodhisattva, deluded within the *sheli*, is beguiled into pursuing the dust of desire, unable to attain liberation and thus failing to realize fruition. Transmigrating through kalpas, lost in delusion—all because they know not the bodhisattva’s origin, mistakenly clinging to this *shishen* as true.\n\nThus, Chan Master Jing said:\n*\"Those who study the Dao long yet fail to recognize the true\nAre but those who, from the outset, took the recognizing spirit as real.\nThe root of birth and death since beginningless time—\nFools call it their original body.\"*\n\nMaster Nanquan also said: \"The mind is not the Buddha; wisdom is not the Dao.\" And Mazu added: \"‘The mind is the Buddha’—this is but a means to quiet a child’s wailing. How dreadful!\" Yet today’s Buddhists, hearing that \"the mind is not the Buddha, wisdom is not the Dao,\" do they not fall into emptiness and nihility, left adrift and anchorless?\n\nOne may ask: What then is to be cultivated? The answer: *Guan* is the numinous radiance within our right mindfulness. Those who have not received true transmission call it \"original nature.\" Now, the bodhisattva dwells in the Pure Land, separated from this *guan* by eight inches and four *fen*. Without *guan*, they cannot meet—precisely what the following text means by \"harmonizing and coalescing, decisively accomplishing fruition.\" The bodhisattva, being the true essence of wisdom-life, is called Buddha-nature. From the moment one leaves the womb with a cry, *guan* and the bodhisattva are sundered by the eyes’ gaze. Moreover, the bodhisattva is hidden and profoundly secret; without a teacher’s direct pointing, even the most keenly intelligent and spiritually awakened cannot perceive it.\n\nThe *Daoxin* says: \"The mind of the Dao is most subtle.\" From this point onward, day and night, in all affairs—whether wisdom, intelligence, or discernment—it is always the *shishen* at work. Thus, the ancestral masters declared: \"You lack Buddha-nature.\" Therefore, the Tathāgata, moved by compassion, taught all sentient beings to constantly observe this bodhisattva. The bodhisattva, having received the wisdom-power of this numinous radiance, over time naturally awakens as from a dream, suffused with warmth like steaming vapor, vibrant as a pearl in a basin. Suddenly, one becomes lucidly alert, emitting great light. When the time and power are ripe, it surges upward like a tidal wave, merging with our *shixing* to become one. At this point, the *shixing* dies, and the Buddha-nature’s numinosity shines forth—vivid, self-possessed, once more the true master. Its light pervades the trichiliocosm; the six supernormal powers are all complete. Amidst all dust and defilement, I alone abide in serene singularity, perfectly fused with the Great Void. This is what is meant by \"all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature.\"\n\nThough it be so, following the current leads to becoming human or other beings; reversing it leads to becoming a Buddha or patriarch. The transformations of ordinary and sacred—all arise from this single entity, this \"one thing, one *Taiji*.\" With this *Taiji*, there is awareness and speech; without it, the eyes droop and the mouth closes. Physicians call it \"true fire\"—formless and shadowless, concealed behind the navel and before the kidneys, slightly below, suspended in an empty cavity. The ancients called this the Pure Land’s homeland, the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the wondrous existence within true emptiness. With this true fire, it steams and nurtures the formed; without it, breath ceases and form decays.\n\nThe Sixth Patriarch said: \"The mind is the earth; nature is the king. When the king dwells upon the earth of the mind, as long as the king is present, the body and mind endure; when the king departs, the body and mind perish.\" Yet this mind is not the fleshy heart—it is the mind of the Dao. Thus it is said: \"The mind of the Dao resides at the North Star, around which all stars revolve\"—this is it. Among all Buddhists under heaven, if one does not cultivate this bodhisattva, is there any other Dao to cultivate? If there were, it would belong to heterodox side doors, not the Dao of Avalokiteśvara.\n\nThe *Ratnakūṭa Sūtra* states: \"Harmonizing and coalescing, decisively accomplishing fruition.\" This is the Tathāgata’s esoteric teaching, the secret text of the entire *Tripiṭaka*—the precious method of dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*. Thus it is said: \"decisively accomplishing fruition.\" Alas, from Emperor Ming of Han to the present day, not a single person has expounded this Dao. Only Bodhidharma and the Second Patriarch Huike received it in secret. Thus, their very flesh transformed, and they ascended to the Great Void, attaining the golden body as proof.\n\nBodhidharma hinted at it, and Huike, in his scriptures, elucidated this Dao. Yet disciples concealed and sealed his books. I now clarify and complete the exposition, wishing that fellow cultivators may universally realize it, avoid straying into side doors, escape illness and premature death, and swiftly attain the Great Dao.\n\nNow, *he* (harmony) is the *yin-qi* within the heart, which goes to harmonize with the *yang-qi* in the kidneys. When the *yin-qi* receives this *yang-qi*, there is a place for the mind to settle and life to take root—thus it is called *he* (harmony).\n\nThe *he* (union) is the *yang-qi* within the kidneys, which receives the *yin-qi* from the heart. When the *yang-qi* receives this luminous *qi*, it forms a body of contraction, gathering, and firmness—thus it is called *he* (union). As the *Yijing* states, \"The interplay of *yin* and *yang* is called the Dao; an excess of either *yin* or *yang* is called illness.\" From ancient times, buddhas and patriarchs have always cultivated both *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life), never leaning to one side.\n\nMoreover, *ning* (congealing) is the method of congealing the spirit; *ji* (gathering) is the way of gathering life. If life is not gathered, bodhi cannot be attained. This is what Mencius meant by \"accumulating righteousness to give rise to it\"—here, *xing* and *ming* are cultivated together, nourishing the spirit and *qi* in a simple and easily attainable manner. Yet people do not know of dual cultivation, so the Tathāgata said, \"Harmony and union are the way.\"\n\nSince leaving the mother’s womb, a person’s spirit cannot attend to their *qi*, nor can their *qi* attend to their spirit. The spirit is stored in the heart and expressed through the two eyes, while the seven apertures share in its daily upward dissipation. The *qi* is stored in the kidneys and expressed through the root of lust, dissipating downward in the quiet of night. How much endowment can one truly possess? When it is exhausted—alas!\n\nWithout seeking a teacher’s guidance to congeal and gather, one’s cultivation is nothing more than this single *yin*-spirit within the heart. Little do they know that this spirit, being purely *yin*, cannot independently achieve the supreme Dao. Thus, the World-Honored One taught people to, in all twelve hours of the day, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, gather the subtle spirit and congeal it into the *ming* (life). When *ming* receives this spirit, it is like a minister receiving their sovereign—submissive and settled, never daring to dissipate or lean to one side. With such effort, and upon awakening to the method of gathering *yang* as it arises, the young may achieve this in a month, those of middle age in three to five months. Within the life-gate, imperceptibly, something arises from nothing, its origin unknown. Suddenly, the true mechanism stirs, and the bliss is beyond words. At this point, one must guard it closely and swiftly turn the Dharma-wheel. Thus, the Tathāgata offers humanity this crucial teaching: if you cultivate according to this method of harmony, union, congealing, and gathering, you will surely attain accomplishment.\n\nThe *Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch* says, \"When sentient beings come, plant the seed.\" For *qing* (passion) is the celestial mechanism for initiating the cultivation of the wisdom-life. Without this *qing*, buddhahood can never be achieved. It is like a farmer without seed hoping for a harvest—how foolish! Today’s Chan monks fail to attain buddhahood simply because they do not understand this *qing*.\n\nIn the past, the Fifth Patriarch’s former life was the Pine-Planting Daoist, who sought the Dao from the Fourth Patriarch. Seeing his aged form, the Fourth Patriarch said, \"You may transform and return.\" The Daoist indeed died standing, then reincarnated into the Zhou family to attain the true Dao. Since he could die standing and re-enter the womb without relying on a father, was he not already accomplished in the Dao? What more did he seek?\n\nMazu said, \"It is not a thing.\" The Sixth Patriarch said, \"Lustful nature is buddha-nature.\" These two statements fully revealed the celestial mechanism. Thus, Chan Master Longya said:\n*\"Human passion is thick, the Dao’s passion faint,\nHow could the world know the Dao’s use of passion?\nWith passion but no Dao, how long can it last?\nPassion alone cannot sustain the Way.\"*\n\nThis single word *qing* has been annotated endlessly since Emperor Ming of Han’s time. Without grasping the method of the wisdom-life, one might mistake it for worldly passion, learning only a few clichéd Chan phrases and claiming enlightenment, deceiving the foolish. Yet in future generations, those with clear eyes will see through this and mock it. If it were truly a corrupting thing, how could the Fifth and Sixth Patriarchs have practiced it and deceived later generations? The Fifth and Sixth Patriarchs, being direct heirs of the Tathāgata, indeed concealed the Dao of the wisdom-life and did not transmit it to the unworthy.\n\nSomeone may ask, \"What is this *qing*?\" Huayang said, \"This *qing* is the nurturing of the wisdom-life, the mechanism that suddenly opens the primordial gate. Though the wisdom-life is stored in the primordial gate, when still, it arises outwardly, attaching to the external form and stirring. When it coincides with the intent in my heart, awareness arises—this outward movement is called *qing*.\" Hence, the method of closing the *yang*-gate.\n\nThe Tathāgata said, \"Without recognizing movement and stillness, studying the Dao is futile.\"\n\nAnother may ask, \"What does it mean to plant the seed?\" The answer: \"This *qing* is the path of birth leading to buddhahood, whether following or reversing the flow. The beginning of the Dao’s creation cannot return without true intent. For those learning Buddhism, once they understand the mechanism of bodily movement, they should congeal their true intent from stillness into the life-palace. Congealing it repeatedly over time, the celestial mechanism will stir, and imperceptibly, the life-palace will produce bodhi. Thus, it is called planting the seed.\"\n\nAnother may ask, \"What is the method of refinement?\" The answer: \"Having understood the method of congealing, one must know the method of refinement—*lian* (refinement) is fire. Fire cannot blaze or transform things without wind. Thus, the World-Honored One said, 'A gentle wind stirs,' and 'After fire transforms, gather the relics.' Those who study must cause the wind of breath to reverse-blow the true fire of the life-palace, drawing back the outwardly arising wisdom-life to its origin. Congeal it steadily, like a fire-seed in a furnace, continuously, like the bellows’ movement. Fumigate and refine it, transforming the tangible into the intangible. Through such cultivation, not only does the wisdom-life within the palace not dissipate outwardly, but this dynamic mechanism also supplements its deficiencies. This is what the Confucians call 'creation and transformation, ceaseless generation.' Over time, the foundation of life becomes full, and one is said to have attained an undying lifespan. Thus, the Tathāgata, when teaching Kāśyapa, called him the 'Undying Arhat.'\"\n\nThe *Mahāprajñāpāramitāhṛdaya Sūtra* says, \"At that time...\"\n\nIndeed, the phrasing of all other sutras invariably employs paired or numbered meanings—yet here it simply states \"at that time,\" is this not most singular! This is the Tathāgata’s urgent injunction to later generations, a wakeful reminder of utmost urgency. Moreover, this \"time\" is not the time of hours or seasons; it is the moment of stirring within meditative stillness.\n\nThe ancient worthies said:\n*\"If one asks when this time arises, there is no fixed hour—*\n*Only the knowing heart knows in the clear wind and bright moon.\"*\n\nThe Confucians say:\n*\"When the moon reaches the heart of heaven,*\n*When the wind comes to the surface of water.\"*\n\nThough these venerable masters revealed such wondrous celestial signs through their metaphors, they never explicitly named what this \"time\" is, nor instructed how one might employ it. I, heedless of transgression, shall thread a single line for all, that none may stray into side doors and may swiftly realize the Dao-fruit—how wondrous would that be!\n\nThis \"time\" is precisely the moment when the wisdom-life within one’s body stirs of itself. The ancient worthies called it the *living midnight hour*, a generative impulse blazing like wildfire, fierce as a gale—without the master’s transmitted intent, breath alone cannot subdue it. It is also named the *ravenous tiger* that devours one’s nature and sucks out one’s marrow; no hero or stalwart of the Three Teachings, lacking true transmission, escapes being undone by it. The determined scholars and lofty persons of old necessarily first subdued this ravenous tiger before attaining their Dao-fruit.\n\nYet its arising manifests thus: a gentle warmth like bathing in balmy waters, a blazing intensity like fire about to ignite—an overwhelming, vigorous, and fierce nature that steams downward to the root of lust, overawing and commanding all the vital essences of the body, leaving none beyond its dominion. Physicians call this the *external kidney*. The wondrous secret of establishing the lineage and becoming an ancestor lies precisely in this point of entry. Once true transmission is received, what need remains for doubt?\n\nMoreover, the notion of *timeliness* is the esoteric secret of the Buddhist Teaching—most urgent indeed. The World-Honored One once preached in the Dragon Palace of Ketumatī. The preceding passage has already encompassed every practical application of timeliness. Yet, fearing that worldly people might fall into emptiness, the Teaching here explicitly designates the locus of true reality, ensuring that practitioners do not lose their grounding.\n\nNow, the Dragon Palace is a metaphor in the Sanskrit of the Western Heaven. In the Middle Kingdom, it is called the *Cinnabar Field*, also known as the *qi-cavity*; physicians term it the *essence-orifice*—its names are many. In the Western Heaven, it is further called the *Pure Land*, the *Realm*, the *Sea of Suffering*, the *Sea-Bottom*, the *Land of Ultimate Bliss*, or *Udāna*—its appellations are manifold, yet all refer to the place where the true seed harmonizes.\n\nThus, the *Mohe Zhiguan* states: \"The Sanskrit *Udāna* is the Cinnabar Field of this land.\" Hence, those who attained the Dao in recent times, fearing that people might not awaken, also called it the *Furnace*. This is the compassionate metaphor of the patriarchs, guiding people to recognize a concrete locus. Just as a blacksmith, wishing to forge a sharp and exquisite implement, cannot succeed without a furnace, so too is the practice of cultivation.\n\nWhat, then, is the Furnace? It is the place where transformation and formation occur. The method is easily understood. Thus, the *Heart Sutra* commentary says: \"Gather it and place it within the cinnabar furnace, refining it until the Golden Crow glows red.\" The *Radiant Tathāgata* says: \"Fire arises in the furnace,\" and again: \"Fire in the furnace reveals the celestial mechanism; failing to awaken to the Western advent is delusion.\"\n\nMaster Yuantong of the Chan school said: \"Hide the body within the Northern Dipper.\" The Northern Dipper is the Dragon Palace mentioned above; \"hiding the body\" is the condensation spoken of earlier. The patriarchs teach that if one constantly conceals one’s true thought within the Northern Dipper, the mind becomes empty and the life-force naturally stabilizes. Thus, the verse given to the Great Being reads: \"With an empty mind, one returns having passed the examination.\"\n\nMaster Jiwu said: \"Concentrate the spirit and withdraw it into this orifice, and the *qi* will follow the spirit, naturally returning to this place.\" Moreover, Jiwu fully grasped the complete essence of Tathāgata Damo and the orthodox transmission of the wisdom-life. Thus, his transformations were unfathomable and boundless. During the Yongzheng era, he repeatedly appeared in Taiyi, manifesting dozens of yang-bodies. Every household had its own Jiwu—eating, drinking, and conversing. When he concealed himself, no trace remained. At times, he bestowed gold, silver, or beautiful women; at others, he displayed ferocious tigers, water, or fire. Among his disciples, all worldly desires and thoughts were extinguished.\n\nNow, *condensation* means *to move*; the *orifice* is the Cinnabar Field, also called the Furnace. This signifies the locus from which *qi* arises—when one applies effort. For *qi* moves and attaches to external forms, issuing forth. If left to its own course, how can it serve as the root of the Dao? Therefore, the patriarchs instruct: at this moment, swiftly condense the spirit into the Cinnabar Field. When *qi* is gathered by the spirit’s absorption, it too returns.\n\nMoreover, this *qi* is not the *qi* of breathing but the *qi* of the primordial—what Mencius called the *vast and flowing qi*. This *qi* is guarded by the Buddhist Teaching and all accomplished patriarchs, who refuse to disclose it outright. Instead, they employ metaphors from external things, allowing people to awaken on their own. Only when one understands is the secret transmission given. Thus, it is called \"a special transmission outside the teachings\"—another name for *qi*.\n\nIn the Buddhist Teaching, it is called the *Staff*, the *Tin Staff*, *Dhyāna*, *Plucking the Reed*, *White Snow*, *Golden Lotus*, *Respectful Fruit*, *Cave Water*, *Sea Water*, *Bright Star*, *Western River Water*, *Caoxi Water*, *Water Buffalo*, *Sea-Bottom Goodness*, *Furnace Fire*, *Muni Pearl*, *Sea-Bottom Mud Ox*, *Sea-Bottom Bright Pearl*, *Sea-Bottom Blossoming*, *Furnace Incense Smoke*, *Affair*, *Thing*—its names are innumerable, yet in truth, they all refer to this single *qi*.\n\nThus, Chan Master Yellow Leaf, upon seeking the Sixth Patriarch and completing his cultivation, sighed and said: \"The Dao is nothing but *qi*.\" This single utterance revealed the celestial mechanism in its entirety. He also said: \"If the practice is unceasing, with every breath returning here, after one or two months, one will naturally feel the orifice suffused with warmth, the *qi* gently stirring.\"\n\n*Breath* is the *qi* of inhalation and exhalation, which the Buddha likened to *wind*—also called the *Staff*, like an old man leaning on a cane to walk. For those cultivating the wisdom-life, without this breath to blow and nurture, the leakage will not be transformed, and the śarīra will not form. Thus, the Chan master said: \"Before reaching the end of water and the exhaustion of mountains, pass the time as a companion,\" meaning this.\n\nNow, the root of human breath originally lies in the Cinnabar Field, but people only know how to exhale, not how to draw it in. Those who receive the true transmission possess a spirit in the Cinnabar Field capable of connecting with the breath. Thus, the Chan master said: \"The flute without holes, blown from both ends.\" Only when spirit and *qi* unite does one naturally become warm. The Dharma Wheel turns of its own accord—whether in one or two months depends on whether one is young or old. For the young, the furnace’s efficacious mechanism stirs within a month; for the old, it may take several months before signs of fusion and integration appear, and the warm *qi* begins to move.\n\nThe *Pure Light Tathāgata* said:\n*\"The golden youth, awakening, left the royal palace,\nUnknowing, he entered the Dharma-sea like a rhinoceros.\nSeeking to return to his native land,\nOnly at Spirit Mountain’s pagoda did he find the trace.\"*\n\nThe \"prince\" is the World-Honored One. When the World-Honored One aspired to cultivate, a heavenly deity transformed into a white horse, carrying the prince out of the royal palace and soaring to the Snow Mountains. There, he cut his hair with a golden knife. Initially, without receiving the true transmission, he practiced heterodox methods, so his leakage was not transformed, and no achievement was attained. His body became emaciated and weak. Later, he received the orthodox transmission of the wisdom-life from Asita and thus attained Buddhahood.\n\nThus, the *Lotus Sutra* says: \"The immortal bestowed upon the Buddha the wondrous Dharma, and the Tathāgata thereby attained Buddhahood.\"\n\nThe *Record of Buddhist Lineages* further states: When Asita saw the prince’s emaciated form, he said to him, \"You should drink cow’s milk to restore your original vitality.\" The prince indeed drank the milk, and his thirty-two marks were thereby fully restored. His Dao-fruit reached perfection, and he sought the Buddha Dīpaṃkara to bear witness.\n\nWhen the World-Honored One first applied himself to cultivating the supreme Dao, without waiting for months to pass, he suddenly beheld the morning star and sighed, saying, \"All sentient beings possess Buddha-nature; how could they fail to attain this Dao except through their own fault?\" The Buddha-nature of which the World-Honored One spoke is the wisdom-life.\n\nThe \"cow\" is qi; the \"sea\" is the cinnabar field. If one seeks this cow, its hidden place lies within the Dharma-ocean—nowhere else. Thus it is said: \"Within the Northern Dipper, the body is concealed.\" \"Spirit Mountain\" is the heart; \"beneath the pagoda\" is the cinnabar field. When the Tathāgata teaches people to cultivate the Dao, he first instructs them to cultivate beneath the pagoda, and only afterward does the cow return to its native land as verification. Thus the *Hidden Sutra* says: \"Every person possesses a Spirit Mountain pagoda; it is best to cultivate beneath the Spirit Mountain pagoda.\" \"Knowing the trace\" refers to the sudden arising of something from nothing within the cinnabar field. Without awaiting external discussion, one’s own mind becomes aware of warmth, harmony, and ease—a scene of springtime unbounded. The joy is inexhaustible, just as Mazu said: \"It reaches the skin and hair, suffusing the four limbs.\"\n\n\"Return\" means to revert; \"native land\" is the field of the heart. Only by descending from the middle and returning to the upper does one transform consciousness into Buddha-nature, forge habitual thoughts into right mindfulness, and allow consciousness to die so that the original nature appears—a radiant master. Thus it is called \"returning to the native land.\"\n\nMaster Yuan Tong said: \"When the host of yin is entirely stripped away, the one yang revives. To perceive the heart of heaven and earth, one must recognize the method of riding yin.\" \"The host of yin being entirely stripped away\" refers to the eleventh month of the year and, in the human body, to the Northern Sea. \"The one yang reviving\" refers to the winter solstice in the year and, in the human body, to the arising of yang. The heart of heaven is precisely the place where yang arises. As Shaozi said: \"At the midpoint of the winter solstice, the heart of heaven remains unchanged.\"\n\nTo perceive this heart, one must seek the method of refinement, and only then will there be a visible countenance to behold—the true seed from which the method arises, just as the World-Honored One beheld the morning star. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When establishing a bodhimandala, first take the powerful white ox from the Snow Mountains; one may use its dung to plaster the ground.\" The \"bodhimandala\" here refers to the initial step in cultivating the Buddha-Dao. \"Plastering with ox dung\" is precisely the foundation for refining the wisdom-life.\n\nWhen the World-Honored One taught people to cultivate the Dao, he first instructed them to refine the wisdom-life. If one does not refine the pure yang of the wisdom-life but instead begins by cultivating only the yin spirit within the heart, how can one avoid encountering the yin demons described in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*? Nowadays, those in the Chan school who cultivate nature without cultivating life often become inverted, contracting illnesses and dying prematurely. Though they may verbally claim sudden enlightenment, the ten grounds, and the three vehicles, they often end up aging in vain, unaware of the excellence of the Snow Mountain white ox’s dung. They vainly grind bricks to make mirrors and collect snow for sustenance, wasting many years. Without establishing the foundation of life, how can there be any principle by which the nature-Dao may be accomplished? It is like actors on a stage who claim to be Emperor Gaozu or King Xiang Yu.\n\nNow, \"snow\" is white, and white is the true color of the Western Direction—an allusion to the qi of the life-gate. Thus, when the Tathāgata taught people to cultivate the Western Pure Land, it was precisely this. A skilled physician further clarified: \"Before the two kidneys hangs a white circle; the precelestial water and fire of life and destiny reside within it, formless and traceless, empty and vast. The wisdom-life is precisely within it.\" If one does not swiftly cultivate oneself, how can one abide long? Chasing fame and profit dissipates it; pursuing sensual desires destroys the true. Those who leave the household, reciting sutras and sitting in dry meditation, deplete their qi and exhaust their spirit—like a lamp running out of oil, extinguished before reaching fifty. Thus it is called \"Snow Mountain.\"\n\nMoreover, \"life\" is the original qi. The qi is unparalleled in its firmness; its color is white and flawless. Thus it is called the \"powerful white ox.\" The qi’s concealment and manifestation encompass heaven and earth, bear the myriad things, vast without boundary, subtle without core. Though sought, it leaves no trace; through cultivation, it appears before one. It transcends buddhas and surpasses ancestors—there is nothing that is not this qi. This is what Mencius meant by \"utmost greatness, utmost firmness\"—how could it be false?\n\nYet the qi’s transformations are such that in the prime of life, it naturally gathers; in extreme stillness, it naturally arises. If one does not preserve and guard it, it dissipates. Thus it is called \"dung.\" If dissipation occurs day after day without early fortification of the root of life, how long can it last? This is what the Confucians meant by \"use it, and it becomes a path; do not use it, and it becomes overgrown with brambles.\"\n\nNow, dung is the supreme treasure for splitting demons and the ladder to buddhahood. Without taking this dung to cultivate, nine out of ten refinements will be empty. It is like someone wishing to build a fine house without a foundation—how could they dwell in it? The ancients of resolve knew the source of this dung: in stillness, they nurtured it; in activity, they gathered it. They returned it to their original ground, using fire to refine and fortify their own foundation—this is called \"plastering the bodhimandala.\"\n\nOnce the foundation of the site is established, one cannot lack a good spiritual friend. Moment by moment, one must seat one’s true intention within it, allowing no thought to arise. How then can the eight winds shake one? As Kangjie said: \"When no thought arises, even spirits and gods cannot know—how much less can I?\" Who alone remains alert? No matter how many demons and monsters assail, I am hidden here, at ease and free. Thus it is said: \"When the master sits in the bodhimandala, he does not encounter demonic kinds!\" This is what Ānanda meant by \"sitting in full lotus on the surface of flowing water, entering extinction.\"\n\nThe annotator and author of this passage breathe through the same nostrils.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* further states: \"One must sever the impetus of lust so that both body and mind are cut off, and even the nature of severance is extinguished—only then may one aspire to the Buddha’s bodhi.\" Since ancient times, none who attained the Way failed first to sever the impetus of lust before transcending buddhas and surpassing patriarchs. Though all who take up the monastic life know the teaching of severing lust in body and mind, the term \"impetus of lust\" alone remains obscure to the world. Not only do they lack the method of cultivation and the understanding of its principles, but even their bodies and minds cannot be made truly free of lust. Why? Once the impetus of lust arises, the form blazes like wildfire, its speed akin to a raging wind. Without the proper method, how can one avoid the afflictions that entangle body and mind? Yet if this impetus is absent, body and mind remain at peace, free from all distress.\n\nThus, the World-Honored One, knowing the peril of this impetus and the difficulty of mastering it alone, taught others how to subdue it. This subduing is not an empty act—there must be a method to it. As Chan Master Cai said: \"The patriarchs’ intent is like empty space, yet not empty; the spiritual mechanism contends for merit through effort.\" This method is most simple and easy, yet without prior good fortune, one may stand before it and never hear of it. Without hearing, how can the impetus of lust ever listen to itself? If one does not swiftly and humbly seek a teacher, no matter how many thousands of times one refines and cultivates, one cannot escape its afflictions. Thus, in recent times, monasteries have seen many karmic obstructions. Even those who claim to be good spiritual friends lack the proper method, and many secretly engage in lustful conduct before and behind their bodies. For this reason, the two great ministers Bi and Shu banished such monks to military exile—this is heaven’s judgment upon their sins.\n\n**Question:** What is the root of lust?\n**Answer:** The impetus of lust is what the World-Honored One called the \"root of lust.\" The root’s form lies externally, while the impetus resides within. Without cultivation, how can one avoid its entanglement of body and mind? This aligns with Mencius’ saying that \"qi can also move the will.\"\n\n**Question:** What method can subdue it?\n**Answer:** Those who obtain the secret instruction, when the impetus is about to arise, employ spirit to govern it, and the impetus naturally subsides. This is what Mencius meant by \"the will is the commander.\" Through breath, one gathers it, causing the qi to return of itself—this is what Bodhidharma called \"gathering.\" Spirit serves as fire, breath as wind. Though the impetus arises from qi, within it lies the potential for exhausting all leaks. Without refining it here, it will again entangle body and mind. Using the elixir field as the furnace, opening and closing as the bellows, refining with fire, fanning with wind, warmth as the sign of efficacy, and ease as the state of no obstruction—through long cultivation, the impetus dies, the nature of lust is severed, and even the nature of severance is extinguished. Body and mind attain peace. The three kinds of lustful affairs no longer gather, and what difficulty remains in aspiring to the Buddha’s bodhi? This is the secret method transmitted among all sages and patriarchs, never before revealed. I have now disclosed it entirely.\n\nFor those who call themselves disciples of the Buddha yet do not cultivate the three kinds of lustful affairs, claiming to be good spiritual friends—these are the fifty-three kinds of demons spoken of in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*. Or if some say I am mistaken, later learners should verify this against the original text. Could the World-Honored One be wrong?\n\nChan Master Jiwu said: When the impetus arises, concentrate the spirit and enter the elixir field. Employ the martial fire to gather and return it, using it to refine and temper. When the impetus has not yet arisen, use the spirit to illuminate the elixir field, employing the civil fire to guard without separation, steaming and simmering. Only through such awakening does one attain the arising of true spirit. The arising of the impetus is the movement of qi in the elixir field. Once the spirit is concentrated, this impetus moves and is subdued by the spirit, naturally inseparable—like a magnet attracting iron, penetrating barriers and merging as one.\n\nThe patriarchs, fearing that when qi arises it may be as fierce as a raging tiger and difficult to subdue, said: \"Use the martial fire.\" This truly exhausts the heavenly mechanism, and their compassion is fully expressed. For ten thousand generations, those who study the Buddha’s teachings will all receive its grace. The use of martial fire is the esoteric method of cultivating the Way, the secret mechanism of becoming a buddha. It is transmitted heart-to-heart by buddhas and mouth-to-mouth by patriarchs, yet awakening to it is exceedingly difficult. Thus, the Fifth Patriarch said: \"Masters secretly instruct in the original sound.\"\n\nThough the World-Honored One and Bodhidharma spoke of fire refining and wind fanning, the application of civil and martial methods was never recorded in writing. Thus, those without dual cultivation could not believe it. Since Bodhidharma and Jiwu passed away, there have been no monks of both spirit and form perfectly attuned.\n\n**Question:** What is \"gathering with martial fire\"?\n**Answer:** Gathering with martial fire means using the qi of inhalation and exhalation to gather the true qi and return it to the source, yet it cannot be separated from the true intention as the master. Thus it is said: \"One intention drives two qi,\" stirring and gathering, all depending on the power of intention. Qi easily arises and flows downward, so it is gathered through breath. Without the stirring of breath’s ebb and flow, even with spirit, gathering is difficult, and qi will not return. The two qi are originally used together. Thus, the Chan master said: \"You have a walking staff, and I give you a pillar\"—this illustrates the mechanism of using the two qi in tandem.\n\nDuring the mechanism of breath, I welcome the qi from the yang heel vessel and return it to the furnace—this is what Bodhidharma called \"gathering.\" Whether ten or dozens of times, when the outer form inverts, one stops. Understanding the ebb and flow of these two qi in opening and closing, the original qi naturally returns to the furnace. When using the two qi, the intention in the furnace does not cling to breath but relies on the original qi for gathering, merely borrowing the mechanism of breath as the tool for gathering—this is what the Sixth Patriarch meant by \"going north to receive and ferry.\"\n\nOnce the original qi has returned to the furnace, it must be refined. Intention serves as fire, breath as wind, smelting the resource of exhausting all leaks until it is entirely transformed into qi. The mind is at ease, the countenance composed—this is the work of martial fire.\n\nSomeone asks, \"What is the civil fire?\"\n\nThe answer: The civil fire is neither stored nor guarded, neither stilled nor exhaled. Moment by moment, it remains unwavering, clear and continuous without interruption, each breath returning to the furnace. As an ancient master said, \"The staff comes and goes without cease; the śarīra is perfected and returns to the origin.\" Beware of dullness and distraction—let no thought arise, no intention scatter. Like the fire-seed within the furnace, with such cultivation, how could the true seed fail to grow, the śarīra fail to form, the Great Dao fail to be achieved?\n\nThe Buddha’s tradition records that the World-Honored One attained awakening when facing the Dipper and the bright star. \"Facing\" refers to the Central Flower, known as \"turning the gaze inward.\" The \"Dipper\" is the Northern Dipper, an analogy for the cinnabar field. The \"bright star\" is the radiance of qi emanating from the cinnabar field—precisely the scene where the true seed is born. Thus, Master Xingyang said, \"The red wheel suffuses the earth; beneath the sea, no flower blooms.\" This is it.\n\nMaster Yuantong said, \"Though one hides the body in the Northern Dipper and gains insight, the message of transcending the dust is known by few.\" \"Hiding the body in the Northern Dipper\" means concealing the seed there. If one begins practice elsewhere, one cannot transcend the dust. Those who transcend the dust embody the turning of the Dharma-wheel. If it should turn but does not, the seed is born without return, and all prior effort is wasted—just as Xingyang said, \"To retreat a step is to lose the matter.\" Hence, \"the message of transcending the dust is known by few.\" The above all describes the method of harmonizing the seed.\n\nThe preceding passages reveal the wondrous Dharma of the *Sūtra of the Wisdom-Life* and the celestial mechanism for harmonizing the true seed. The work of wind and fire is no different. This summarizes the method of harmonizing the true seed through wind and fire. The ancient sages refused to disclose it fully, so people found the Great Dao difficult to awaken to, wandering onto side paths. I, in my shallowness, have made it plain to enlighten fellow seekers, that they may not stray into heterodoxy and may swiftly attain right awakening. Those who love the Buddha should quietly devote themselves to this sūtra, cultivating and verifying it themselves to achieve the Great Dao—how joyful that would be!\n\nThus, from the beginning, gather the spirit and turn the light inward to the Dragon Palace, merging into stillness. Await movement with dual forgetting, employing intention and qi in unison, transforming with the spirit-fire, attacking with swift wind, refining with martial fire, and guarding with civil fire. Over time, with ceaseless steaming, intention and qi never part, and the method of harmonious coalescence is attained.\n\nThis summarizes the method of harmonizing the generated true seed. The \"Dragon Palace\" follows the Buddha’s Sanskrit term; in this land, it is called the cinnabar field. Within the cinnabar field lies water, hence the name \"Dragon Palace.\" The nature of water is heavy and sinks, flowing downward day by day. Spirit is fire. The nature of fire is light and rises, flaming upward moment by moment. Ordinary people sink downward and float upward, the two separating and scattering, so they cannot achieve the Dao. The Buddhas and patriarchs congeal fire within water, so the mind becomes empty and fire does not flame upward. Water, heated by fire, no longer flows downward but transforms into qi, which naturally ascends.\n\nWhen gathering the spirit, inner thoughts do not emerge, and outer thoughts do not enter. Vast and empty, unattached and unobstructed, turn the light inward to illuminate. Once illuminated, forget form and intention. To use intention is not to forget; to forget is to be unable to illuminate with intention. \"Mind without absence\" is called illumination; \"desire without annihilation\" is called will. Forgetting and illumination are one yet two, two yet one. When forgetting, the mind is serene yet never fails to illuminate. When illuminating, not a thread stands—never failing to forget. Forgetting and illumination become pure and unified, merging into stillness. Heaven and earth enter me, yet I know not where. Awaiting movement, unaware, warmth and harmony arise, and the outer form stirs. With intention, welcome the qi and return it. Once returned to its origin, fix the spirit within. Use breath to blow and exhale. Over time, with civil fire, neither forgetting nor forcing, in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, never depart from this. How could the true seed fail to be born?\n\nHave you not heard the words of the ancient Daoist who attained the Way? \"In the indistinct, yin and yang first transform; in the misty, heaven and earth begin to revolve.\" The ancient Daoist here is Shao Kangjie. Some in your Buddhist tradition, ignorant and unlearned, claim that Confucians do not know the Great Dao. They strike the seven meditation postures, recite the three verbal mantras, and call it attainment—how laughable! Not only do Confucians hear but not see, but even eminent monks pinch their noses in disgust.\n\n\"Indistinct\" refers to the midst of stillness and concentration, a single undifferentiated mass. Outwardly, one does not see the body; inwardly, one does not see the mind—vague and indistinct. \"First transform\" means that within this indistinctness, suddenly and unaware, warmth and harmony arise, as if bathing. Thus, Master Jiwu said, \"The six directions share spring.\" \"Begin\" is what Master Xingyang called \"the red wheel suffuses the earth.\" \"Revolve\" is the true qi stirring, precisely the moment when the original pass opens and the true seed is born—bringing boundless wondrous joy.\n\nThe *Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch* says, \"The fruit returns to grow in the ground.\" \"Ground\" is called the Pure Land, also the Sea of Suffering, or *udāna*—clever metaphors with different names, all referring to where the fruit grows. \"The fruit returns to grow\" means that only when the mechanism of harmonizing the seed, previously planted by sentient beings with clear awareness, reaches this point does the fruit appear—this is the bodhi seed, also called the śarīra seed.\n\n\"The sun of the Tathāgata of Infinite Light shines clearly; in movement and stillness, it responds without form. Unaware, the Dragon Palace roars.\" \"Without form\" is what Śākyamuni called \"from the beginning,\" and what Confucians call \"the Limitless.\" This thing is originally formless, born from stillness and concentration.\n\nThe Dragon Palace refers to the \"ground\" mentioned earlier. The \"roar\" signifies the \"fruit's growth\" as described above. The Confucians say, \"The cuckoo’s cry heralds spring’s dawn,\" which is the birth of yang qi. To grasp the mechanism of this single roar is to make flowing waters course, to draw in the West River, to pour the sea’s waters over the crown of the head. An ancient master said, \"The earth’s thunder shakes, and the Xun Gate opens.\" Another said, \"The thunder’s beauty resounds from the ground.\" The sun of the Vajra-Garbha Golden Light Tathāgata shines—from the sea’s depths, the mud ox reveals half its horn. The \"sea’s depths\" are one’s own cinnabar field, the Northern Sea. The World-Honored One calls it the Dragon Palace, or the Ganges. Master Xingyang also refers to it as the sea’s depths, the hidden source of the life of wisdom, hence called the \"sea.\" The \"mud ox\" is this life of wisdom; the World-Honored One calls it the *maṇi*, the true seed refined from the harmonizing of the spirit and qi within one’s body. \"Revealing half its horn\" is the symbolic manifestation of the true seed’s impending birth. At this moment, one must hold it with stillness and not rush to gather it. Only when the ox reveals its full horn of its own accord may one proceed with the work. Otherwise, if thoughts stir and startle the ox, it will retreat and vanish without a trace.\n\nMaster Yuantong said, \"One must wait for the primordial aperture to generate the thing; only then can the yang furnace ignite. Do not precede it, nor follow it too late—this is called being born too early.\" Thus, Master Jiwu said, \"If the mechanism has not yet arrived and one forcibly hastens it, the external fire may proceed, but the internal tally will not respond. This only invites the calamity of self-immolation—how could it be permissible?\" Master Yuantong also said, \"If the plum blossom has not bloomed, it is born too early; if it has already bloomed, it is born too late.\" The \"plum blossom\" is the Dao of yang, the harbinger of spring’s message—an analogy for the scene of yang qi arising within the body. \"Not yet bloomed\" signifies yang on the verge of stirring but not yet moved. If one rashly gathers it at this time, the qi is too tender and will not ascend, hence \"born too early.\" \"Already bloomed\" signifies yang qi already in motion. At this time, one must return it to the source. If it is not returned, the qi disperses and loses its foundation, hence \"born too late.\" Master Yuanyu said, \"Advance a step and lose the principle; retreat a step and fail in the task.\" Truly, this is the case. He also said, \"Thus, the frost and wind are wholly spent, and spring is uniquely possessed throughout the heavens.\" \"Thus\" refers to the present moment. \"Frost and wind spent\" signifies the absence of yin qi. \"Spring\" is yang, an analogy for the cinnabar field’s pure yang qi. Within it, the scene is like bathing, the entire body harmonized and blissful beyond compare. Inside and out, all is yang spring—the true scene of the true seed’s birth.\n\nHe further said, \"One must urgently steal it.\" This is the ancestral master’s admonition to later generations: if one sees this scene arise, one must immediately proceed to gather it. If one does not gather it, one misses it face-to-face, and the thing returns along its familiar path. Thus, Master Xingyang said, \"To retreat is to fail in the task.\" His words are true—how could one not awaken? Hence, it is called \"stealing.\" \"Stealing\" means forceful seizure. At this time, one must be fiercely courageous, mastering it with one’s intent, gathering it with one’s breath, returning this true seed to the elixir furnace, and only then applying the work of the Dharma wheel.\n\nMaster Jiwu said, \"When the six directions share spring, all things find their place.\" \"Six directions sharing\" refers to the entire body; \"spring\" is an analogy for the warmth suffusing the body. \"Things\" is a Buddhist term, corresponding to the Confucian *yuanqi*. When the work reaches its appointed time and this thing is about to be born, one becomes unaware, and suddenly the cinnabar field is warm and harmonious, the entire body soft and blissful, spring arising in every pore. Body and mind are without mastery, the cinnabar field warm and melting, gradually ascending. The yang organ stirs vigorously, and suddenly a roar erupts, breath abruptly ceasing. Heart and thing cling like magnets, intent and breath embrace like hibernating insects. Unawares, one enters a state of vagueness—heaven, earth, self, and others are nowhere to be found. All is merged and boundless, yet this is not the dry emptiness of today’s Chan practitioners. Within this vagueness, the heart refuses to abandon the thing, and the thing refuses to leave the heart. They are intimate and inseparable, entwined as one. Within this scene, it seems to open and close, yet no opening or closing is truly seen; it seems to leak and spill, yet no leakage or spillage occurs. Its wonder cannot be described in words.\n\nThus, the *Heart Sūtra* commentary says, \"The first stirring of yang holds boundless messages.\" Soon after, in a state of vagueness, the heart regains its numinosity, breath resumes, and the qi of the cinnabar field moves from below to behind, along the root of the kidney channel, between the pubic hair. The pleasure of nurturing life cannot be restrained—this is what is meant by \"when qi fills, the Ren and Du meridians open of themselves.\" Swiftly gather it and return it to the source, turning the great Dharma wheel. Otherwise, if this thing overflows, all previous efforts will be wasted.\n\nThis entire passage fully reveals the celestial mechanism. I obtained this wondrous Dao only after more than thirty years. Later cultivators, when your practice reaches this point, take heed, take heed! Do not overlook the scenes within. If you attain two or three of them, it is the birth of the true seed. One need not rigidly adhere to this, for physical constitutions vary. Bodhidharma said, \"In the second stage, gather the *maṇi*.\" This refers to the stage of gathering the thing and returning it to the furnace. \"Second stage\" means the first stage is when the living yang arises, and the second stage is when yang accumulates to fullness and the true seed is born. \"Gathering\" means that when this thing is born, it still follows its familiar path, descending and leaking. Thus, one uses breath to gather it and return it to the furnace.\n\nThe term *maṇi* is another name for this thing, which the Confucians call *primordial qi*. It is also said: \"In the second stage, gather the *maṇi*; in the fourth stage, there are wondrous functions; in the sixth stage, there are distinct spiritual powers.\" The aforementioned \"second stage\" refers to the stages of birth and production. This \"second stage\" here encompasses the two stages of gathering and sealing. Those who study Buddhism must pay close attention and not treat them as one and the same. By examining the *Six Stages of the Dharma Wheel* diagram, it becomes clear. This \"second stage\" refers to the moment when the true seed is produced: gathering it and returning it to the furnace is one stage, and sealing it within the furnace is another, hence the two stages. Once returned to the furnace, one should swiftly raise and lower the *maṇi* to turn the Dharma Wheel and form the *śarīra*. Rising is one stage, descending is another, and bathing constitutes two stages—altogether four stages, hence \"in the fourth stage, there are wondrous functions.\" Gathering, sealing, rising, descending, and bathing together make six stages, hence \"in the sixth stage, there are distinct spiritual powers.\" Returning to the root and nurturing the *śarīra* requires no further action.\n\nThe Sixth Patriarch said, \"Go north to receive and ferry.\" \"Go\" means directing the mind; \"north\" refers to the *dantian*; \"receive\" means using the mind to grasp the thing; \"ferry\" refers to the rising and descending movements. Master Jiwu of the Chan school said, \"Gather and raise, then descend: ascend along the *Du Mai* to the *niwan*, and descend along the *Ren Mai* to the *dantian*.\" The *Ren* and *Du* meridians are the pathways through which the Dharma Wheel circulates. The *Ren Mai* begins at the front arc of the *dantian*, winds through the abdomen, passes through the throat, and ascends to the crown. The *Du Mai* starts at the rear arc of the *dantian*, runs alongside the spine to the *fengfu*, enters the brain, and converges with the *Ren Mai*. When these two meridians are unobstructed, all the meridians become free. Gathering proceeds along this path, the Dharma Wheel turns along this path, and those who recognize this path will form the *śarīra* along it.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Closing the door is called *Kun*; opening the door is called *Qian*. One closing and one opening is called *change*; ceaseless coming and going is called *communication*.\" This describes the workings of the Dharma Wheel through the two *qi*. Moreover, among the scriptures of Buddhist cultivation, those revered by past masters—such as the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* and the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*—are considered foremost. Among the scriptures of Confucian cultivation, none surpass the *Book of Changes*. The abbot of Taiyi Haihui Monastery, Longjiang, asked: \"In the Sanskrit texts of the Western regions, I have never seen mention of the *Book of Changes*. Why include it here, as it does not align with Buddhist teachings?\" I replied: \"To cling to one and remain ignorant of the other—what you practice is merely a side door. The Dao of the ancient sages has never been glimpsed by those a thousand generations before or after. This person, this mind—how could the Three Teachings have two different Ways? You fail to see that the source of the *Book of Changes* is the origin of the Dao itself.\"\n\nHe asked: \"If this is a Daoist text, why do contemporary Confucian scholars treat the *Book of Changes* as a manual for examination essays and divination, rather than for cultivation?\" I replied: \"Examination essays and divination are the pursuits of worldly Confucians, not those who transcend the mundane. The greatest Confucians of antiquity explored the principles of the *prior-heaven*, investigated the mechanisms of opening and closing, probed the roots of things, and mastered *xing* and *ming* within themselves, independent of external creation. They embodied the celestial principle, standing apart from the multitude—hence they are called Confucians.\"\n\nHe asked: \"What is the practice of the Dao?\" I replied: \"The Dao operates through the *prior-heaven*, borrowing the claws and planks of the *posterior-heaven* to turn the Dharma Wheel. Closing the door is the mechanism of inhalation—inhale, and it descends, hence *Kun*. Opening the door is the mechanism of exhalation—exhale, and it ascends, hence *Qian*. This is the principle of the *posterior-heaven*.\"\n\nTransformation is the waxing and waning of the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams, akin to driving a chariot. *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the wheels, while transformation acts as the axle. The chariot cannot move on its own; it relies on the axle at both ends, and the axle in turn depends on the wheels at both ends. The wheels, moreover, depend on the opening and closing of inhalation and exhalation to propel them. The chariot turns by means of the axle and rotates by means of the wheels, while the wheels are driven by the impetus of opening and closing—only then is its function complete.\n\nShould this remain unclear, further study of the Six Signs Diagram will reveal its profound subtleties. The inexhaustible coming and going is the mechanism by which the *qi* of *prior-heaven* and *posterior-heaven* circulate and transform. \"Permeation\" refers to the pivotal mechanism by which the *prior-heaven* and *posterior-heaven* operate in unison, penetrating the primordial pass.\n\nTo equate the ceaseless alternation of a single inhalation and exhalation through the nose and mouth with this inexhaustible coming and going is to stray far from the great Dao of *prior-heaven*.\n\nHe asked: \"What then should one do?\"\nI replied: \"Employ the breath of *posterior-heaven* to activate the breath of *prior-heaven*. The exhalation mechanism is opening and *Qian*; the inhalation mechanism is closing and *Kun*. *Qian* and *Kun* are the fixed positions of Heaven and Earth. In the human body, the head is *Qian*, and the abdomen is *Kun*. Transformation is the master within *Qian* and *Kun*—it is one’s true intention, which sets the mechanism of the two *qi* in motion.\n\nIt is like the Northern and Southern Dipper stars: their ceaseless coming and going is the circulation of the two *qi*. You come as I go, I go as you come—like the shuttle of a villager weaving cloth. You rise as I descend, I descend as you rise—hence the inexhaustibility.\n\nYet while this is so, one must not place equal emphasis on *prior-heaven* and *posterior-heaven* simultaneously. During the phases of ascent and descent, though intention governs the Dipper’s pivot, the spirit must prioritize alignment with *prior-heaven*, merely borrowing the opening and closing mechanism of *posterior-heaven* to mobilize the *prior-heaven*.\n\nHe further asked: \"This disciple is dull-witted and begs for the key principle, lest I presume to practice on my own and commit the error of disclosure.\"\nI replied: \"The World-Honored One said, ‘Only when all beings are liberated does one liberate oneself.’ How could this be an error? Moreover, in the present age of the Buddhist teaching, is there no such dual cultivation?\"\nI answered: \"This is the secret mechanism of turning the Dharma Wheel. The sages of *Qian* did not dare speak of it plainly; the myriad patriarchs did not dare point it out directly. It is subtler than the subtlest, more refined than the most refined. Though laypeople may hear of it, only those with prior karmic blessings may encounter it.\"\n\nHe pleaded: \"This disciple earnestly begs the master to bestow grace.\"\nI replied: \"Though inhalation is the closing of *Kun* below, the primordial *qi* of *Kun*’s abdomen passes through me and ascends. To ascend is to rise to *Qian*. Though exhalation is the opening of *Qian* above, the primordial *qi* of *Qian*’s head passes through me and descends. To descend is to fall to *Kun*. Altogether, this is the ascent and descent of the two *qi*—*prior* and *posterior*—along three pathways: front, back, and center. Together, they form the wheel and axle of *Qian* and *Kun*, communicating the subtle movements of the primordial pass. The master is intention; the agent of circulation is spirit.\n\nWith each inhalation, there is an ascent; with each exhalation, a descent—no deviation by even a hair’s breadth. Follow the prescribed path, counting the steps without falling short or exceeding the measure. *Qian* is nine, *Kun* is six; four manipulations complete the pattern. In harmony with creation, in accord with the wheel’s turning, neither biased nor imbalanced, precisely aligned—no matter the disputes among teachings, those who attain the Dao do not depart from this method.\n\nIt is further said: '*Qian*’s line employs nine; *Kun*’s line employs six.' This refers to the numerical rules and limits governing the turning of the Dharma Wheel’s mechanism. *Qian* employs nine: four nines make thirty-six, and each of the three cycles in the first, second, and third rounds uses four manipulations. *Kun* employs six: four sixes make twenty-four, and each of the three cycles in the first, second, and third rounds likewise uses four manipulations.\n\nIn ancient times, the first through sixth rounds were designated for ascent, aligning with *Qian*. Thus, *Qian*’s lines and *Qian*’s counts were used: *Qian*’s line employs nine, and four manipulations yield thirty-six. Therefore, the ascent of the Dharma Wheel also employs nine, corresponding to the four manipulations. The total count for *Qian*’s six lines, each manipulated four times, is two hundred sixteen—hence the six rounds of ascent also total two hundred sixteen.\n\nThe first through sixth rounds were designated for descent, aligning with *Kun*. Thus, *Kun*’s lines and *Kun*’s counts were used: *Kun*’s line employs six, and four manipulations yield twenty-four. Therefore, the descent of the Dharma Wheel also employs six, corresponding to the four manipulations. The total count for *Kun*’s six lines, each manipulated four times, is one hundred forty-four—hence the six rounds of descent also total one hundred forty-four.\n\nCombined, they yield three hundred sixty, completing one full cycle of the Dharma Wheel’s numerical progression. Yet within this, there are two rounds of purification that do not employ the nine-six-four manipulations, leaving the total short of three hundred sixty. The earlier reference to 'three hundred sixty' implies that the sixty omitted from the purification rounds are already accounted for within it.\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: 'All Buddhas, in samādhi, turn the wondrous Dharma Wheel in perfect timing.' This is an analogy for the two rounds of purification. 'In samādhi, in perfect timing' refers to the two boundary states of purification. The Confucians call them the *mao* and *you* hours; the Buddhists likewise refer to them as such. If not for these designated times, why would it be called 'perfect timing'? 'Samādhi' means that during these two hours, one does not engage in inhalation or exhalation. Spirit and *qi* embrace and guard each other, abiding in stillness before resuming the turning.\n\nThe Confucians say these two hours are the directions of life and death, where punishment and virtue oppose each other—no action should be taken, only stillness and guarding. Moreover, during the turning of the Dharma Wheel, there is a method of purification within the rounds.\n\nHe asked: \"I have only heard of east and west as purification, not of purification within the rounds. Pray, enlighten me.\"\nHuayang said: \"When turning the Dharma Wheel, the breath of inhalation and exhalation moves like the water-lifting board of a well—one board at a time it rises, one board at a time it descends. Since there are prescribed rounds, how could a single breath carry it all the way to Heaven?\"\n\nEven when moving freely, it does not align with the blessings of the Dharma Wheel’s \"claw,\" nor does it form the proper steps of the prescribed rounds. If one operates in such disorder, the Dao will not be accomplished.\n\nHe asked: \"This disciple is dull and slow to comprehend. I humbly seek further instruction.\"\nHe answered: \"When turning the Dharma Wheel, the breath of inhalation and exhalation has a mechanism of return. It is precisely at this point of return that purification occurs.\"\nHe asked: \"What is purification?\"\nHe answered: \"Exhalation retreating is purification; inhalation advancing is also purification—it is merely a distinction of before and after. This is an ancient, closely guarded mechanism. The Buddhist records of the World-Honored One say: *Entering the pool to bathe.* The pool refers to the east and west directions. After the World-Honored One saw the morning star, he entered these two pools to purify himself. The joy of that permeating warmth is an analogy for these two directions. This method, from the Han dynasty to the present, has been hidden by those who attained it, revealed only in perfect stillness.\"\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: \"To tread the path walked by the Tathāgata, neither too slow nor too swift, one examines and walks with careful discernment.\"\n\nThe Dao is a path—specifically, the Conception and Governing Vessels. \"Neither too slow nor too swift\" means regulating the method through breath. \"Examining with careful discernment and walking the path\" signifies that whenever the Dharma Wheel is turned, spirit and qi must move and abide together. If one wanders aimlessly outside the Dao, drifting in vagueness without following its course, one cannot form the śarīra. The Tathāgata said: \"Neither exert too much nor too little.\" Turning the Dharma Wheel must accord with nature and align with the Great Dao. If one is overzealous, excess wind arises, the Dharma Wheel cannot circulate, and the flame loses control. If one is negligent, the wind is too weak, failing to cultivate vigorous progress, and transformation cannot occur.\n\nDīpaṃkara Buddha said: \"Constantly turn the Dharma Wheel.\" The Dharma Wheel is a Sanskrit term from the Western Regions; in this land, it is called \"ascent and descent,\" \"advance and retreat\"—the true seed returning to its source. \"Constantly\" means that whenever the true seed is produced, it must complete one full cycle. If it does not circulate, the leakage cannot be stopped, and the śarīra will not form. Yet one must not turn it without rest; though no great harm comes of it, the moment of production will be delayed. The World-Honored One said: \"One should turn such a wondrous Dharma Wheel.\" As for \"wondrous,\" it cannot be described in words—hence it is called \"wondrous.\" But if there are no words, how can later students awaken to it? This depends on whether one has a teacher or not. The Great Dao is most secret—who would dare reveal it entirely? Seeing that there are no dual-cultivation practitioners in the world, I point out these truths to guide learners toward mastery. The wondrous lies in the ebb and flow: those who understand find it most simple and easy; those who do not find it truly difficult and arduous.\n\nConsider the self-sounding clock—it is the Dharma Wheel. The workings of heaven and earth are all contained within it. Country folk who have never seen a clock know only water pestles and water mills, yet the principle is the same. Someone asked: \"How does the clock compare to the pestle and mill in relation to the Dao?\" I answered: \"The clock’s hammer represents breath; the wheels inside represent primordial qi. The water that drives the mill is like breath, and what turns it is like primordial qi. Though the mechanism of the pestle and mill resembles the method, it is not entirely complete. Why is the self-sounding clock said to embody the full function of the Great Dao? The pestle and mill show only advancement, not retreat. The wheels inside the clock turn forward for advancement, but when they reach their limit, they reverse—this reversal is retreat.\"\n\nThe Sixth Patriarch said: \"I have one thing that supports heaven above and earth below.\" That \"thing\" is what the Confucians call primordial qi. \"Supports heaven\" means ascending to the crown; \"supports earth\" means descending to the abdomen. The *Buddhist Records* say: \"The seawater anoints the crown of the Prince.\" The \"sea\" is the cinnabar field; \"water\" is primordial qi. In Buddhist metaphors, it is called \"Creek Water,\" \"the cave stream flowing backward,\" or \"one gulp drinking the entire West River.\" \"Anointing the crown\" is ascent. The \"Prince\" is the Tathāgata.\n\nThe World-Honored One said: \"After cremation, gather the śarīra.\" This refers to the moment when the śarīra is about to form. \"Fire\" is spirit. The śarīra is fully achieved through the power of fire. Yet when it forms, there must be tangible effects—it is not empty or insensate. When the śarīra is about to form, the empty chamber grows bright, the cinnabar field boils like hot soup, and the turtle withdraws, no longer rising. Then one applies the method of gathering, moving it past the three barriers behind the spine and returning it to the central palace to nourish the Dao-embryo—hence the act of retrieval.\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: \"Possessing the form of a man, perfecting the Tathāgata’s hidden horse-phallus sign.\" The \"hidden horse-phallus\" means the turtle becomes thread-like. Only when it withdraws and does not rise is the śarīra successfully formed. If there is even slight movement, one must not consider it complete. The Dharma Wheel must further refine it. Without forging, the qi is tender and weak, unable to break through the barriers. One must wait for the sign of breakthrough before moving it. Once the sign appears, the Dharma Wheel should stop. If one recklessly continues, the śarīra, though formed, will be forced by fire to leak, and one remains an ordinary person.\n\nSome—whether old or ill—whose external kidneys do not rise may mistake this for the formation of the śarīra, but this is incorrect. It lacks the foundation of leakage cessation; one must cultivate further until there is movement before success can be expected. The World-Honored One said: \"The Arhat who does not die.\" \"Does not die\" means longevity. If the external kidney does not rise and the śarīra is formed, this is why one does not die. For example, the Buddha’s disciple Mahākāśyapa lived for seven hundred years. Later, he met the World-Honored One, who transmitted the method of passing the barriers, and he became the Second Patriarch. The Venerable Baozhang lived for 1,712 years. Later, he met Bodhidharma, who transmitted the method of passing the barriers, and only then did he transcend. This is because he had attained the śarīra but had not yet realized the Dao-embryo, so he remained in the world.\n\nAll the above describes the work of turning the Dharma Wheel to form the śarīra—is not the path of wisdom-life entirely contained herein? This summarizes the method of forming the śarīra.\n\nI say: The Dao of forming the śarīra involves many techniques—true spirit, true qi, true intent, breath, mastery, and circulation—too numerous to record in full. When turning the Dharma Wheel in practice, one must single-mindedly gather the two qi and apply the method of circulation, ensuring that spirit harmonizes with true qi and follows the same path. One must not be distracted by other perceptions. Within the twelve regulations, breath drives the circulation, and the rhythm of respiration determines the method. From gathering to returning to the root, one must not depart from it even for a moment. Departure breaks the continuity, and the śarīra will not form.\n\nThough the Dao of forming the śarīra involves many techniques, it is ultimately the simplest and easiest method.\n\nAt first, the practice seems difficult, but with familiarity, it becomes easy. It is like a villager weaving at the loom: hands, feet, head, and eyes must coordinate in all directions. For a beginner, this is most challenging, yet once mastered, the weaver moves without conscious effort—hands, feet, head, and eyes working in perfect harmony, as if governed by some natural mechanism. If one clings to rigid control, the weaving cannot be accomplished. The Great Dao operates in the same way. When turning the Dharma Wheel, intent resides in the elixir field as the wheel’s hub, heart-spirit moves qi as the wheel’s teeth, and breath propels it as the wheel’s axle—all unfolding through that same natural mechanism. What difficulty could there be?\n\nTo avoid distraction, when turning the Dharma Wheel, one must shut out external senses and silence internal thoughts. A single point of true spirit guides the qi in its cycle; the slightest stray thought scatters it through collateral meridians, rendering the effort futile. As for the numbers: each step involves four divinations. Rising becomes yang, yang is *qian*, and *qian* uses nine—four nines make thirty-six. *Qian*’s total for six lines of four divinations each is two hundred sixteen. Descending becomes yin, yin is *kun*, and *kun* uses six—four sixes make twenty-four. *Kun*’s total for six lines of four divinations each is one hundred forty-four. Combined, they form the three hundred sixty numbers, completing the Dharma Wheel’s path—its steps measured with flawless precision. How wondrous! How perfect! This is the Dao. Without this method, nothing can be achieved.\n\nFrom the Han dynasty to the present, this has been kept secret, passed down in confidentiality from Buddha to Buddha, from patriarch to patriarch. I now reveal it in full, hoping that those with aspiration may soon attain the Great Dao. The three hundred sixty numbers are not literally three hundred sixty; they are a metaphor. The wheel has twenty-four teeth, and with each full rotation—front and back—it completes forty-eight, called one revolution of the Dharma Wheel. The wheel’s outer rim thus forms the three hundred sixty numbers, with no discrepancy. Hence, it is called the three hundred sixty numbers.\n\nHave you not heard the words of the World-Honored One to Mahākāśyapa? He spoke of the *True Dharma Eye Treasury*. This is the secret celestial mechanism for obtaining śarīra—hence, the *True Dharma*. The eye is where spirit dwells; where the eye goes, spirit follows. He also said to Ānanda: \"If you do not know where the heart and eyes reside, you cannot subdue the dust and toil.\" This is the sublime principle of the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the hidden mechanism for obtaining śarīra. Without using the heart and eyes to gather it, the śarīra cannot emerge from the furnace. Thus, the *True Dharma Eye Treasury* mentioned above—those who can fathom it truly possess something extraordinary.\n\nAfter three to five days, the elixir field gradually warms, coalescing into a *maṇi* that takes the form of a fire pearl. Signs of efficacy appear in succession, and the wondrous realms are beyond compare. During the gathering phase, one must focus intently, never straying for even a moment. If one strays, the fire cools, the qi disperses, and the *maṇi* will not form. Thus, the seven days of contemplation must not be taken lightly! If one abandons this method for another, the śarīra will never be obtained—at best, one may achieve longevity.\n\nThe *Lotus Sūtra* states: \"I now pledge to uphold this matter for you; it shall not be in vain. You must diligently apply your mind and advance with vigor, practicing this samādhi for seven days, contemplating this matter.\" \"This matter\" is a Buddhist term, equivalent to what the Confucians call true qi. When qi is refined through the wind-and-fire method into śarīra, it is said to be \"not in vain.\" Day and night, without rest, one must hold this single thought—hence, \"diligently apply your mind and advance with vigor.\" All other concerns must be emptied, and the single luminous point of spirit must fix its gaze upon the śarīra—hence, \"contemplating this matter.\" The seven days are the master key to gathering śarīra, corresponding to what the Confucians call \"after seven days, one again perceives the heart of Heaven and Earth,\" or \"after seven days, yang returns.\" The time for gathering may vary—some obtain it in five days, others in six—there is no fixed rule.\n\nThe World-Honored One spoke of the *Six Kinds of Tremors*. This describes the phenomena accompanying the birth of śarīra. The \"six kinds\" refer to six places within the body, not the six directions of the world. The eyes emit golden light, the ears hear the sound of wind, the nose experiences a tugging of qi, behind the brain a vulture’s cry is heard, the body leaps and moves, and in the elixir field, a fire pearl dashes about—these are the six kinds of tremor. He also said: \"Between the eyebrows, a white ray of light constantly shines.\" When the śarīra is fully formed, in complete darkness, one may see this white light—neither too much nor too little. At this moment, gather it, and it will be obtained. This is the marvelous function of the Buddha-Dao.\n\nAs the śarīra prepares to emerge from the furnace, from the elixir field to the eyes, the entire path shimmers with an empty, radiant whiteness, bright as moonlight. If, before this clarity is achieved, the external kidneys do not retract—assuming the form of the *Hidden Horse Yin*—any light that appears is but an illusion born of false imagination, not the light of śarīra. The World-Honored One said: \"The reed sprout pierces the knee.\" The \"reed sprout\" is a clever metaphor for the qi refined in the elixir field—called śarīra, or *bodhi*, or bright pearl, though its names are many; it is nothing other than this qi. \"Pierces\" refers to passing through the three rear barriers. If one uses intent to force the passage, it becomes mere guided exercise—a side door. If one does not use intent, the timing is lost. Neither approach can succeed. Between not guiding and not losing lies the celestial mechanism, which must be transmitted by a teacher. Who would dare reveal it recklessly? This is the most secret and essential teaching of a thousand Buddhas and ten thousand patriarchs. One must earnestly seek a teacher to have any hope of attaining it.\n\nBodhidharma said: \"Crossing the river by breaking a reed.\"\n\nHere the masterful metaphor for passing the barriers—how could ordinary monks, never having received the true transmission, presume that the patriarch merely \"broke a reed to cross the river,\" even claiming he did so beneath Bear Ear Mountain? Absurd! If one cannot cross the sea, how could one cross a river?\n\nNow the patriarch was born in Southern India. Having attained the Dharma, he wished to journey east. The king provided a great ship laden with treasures, and after three years at sea, he landed in Guangzhou. First he met with Liang, but found no affinity. Later he joined with Wei, and there accomplished the great matter.\n\n\"Breaking\" means to seek; \"reed\" is śarīra; \"crossing\" is circulation; \"river\" is the pathway of free movement. The World-Honored One said: \"An arrow pierces nine layers of iron drums.\" The \"arrow\" is true qi; \"shooting\" is the method of spirit and qi moving in unison. The \"nine layers\" refer to the three barriers in the human spine—Weilü, Jiaji, and Yuzhen. Each barrier has openings on both left and right, hence \"nine layers.\" The wondrous method of passing the barriers must proceed through the central aperture; if one races along another path, the Way cannot be attained.\n\nIt is also said: \"Dhyāna-bliss is food.\" Now \"dhyāna-bliss\" is the realm of joy; \"food\" is a metaphor for consuming śarīra, not ordinary eating. When true qi ascends to the crown, enters the throat, and returns to the Central Palace, this is called \"eating.\" Before consuming it, there are perilous paths to traverse—one must guard against leakage of śarīra. Thus the lower throat aperture is solid, while the nasal aperture is empty. If solid, it does not move; if empty, it leaks. Without a teacher’s personal instruction in forming śarīra, one cannot master the method of guiding the \"ox through the nose.\" To recklessly race through the empty aperture, exhausting a thousand hardships to obtain śarīra, only to waste it all—how grievous!\n\nIt is also said: \"Dharma-joy fills to the full.\" \"Dharma-joy\" is spring—true qi. Once this qi returns to the Central Palace, one gradually ceases to eat. Hence it is called \"filling to the full.\" Some go three months without eating, others four. Those with concentrated power achieve fasting quickly; those with scattered power achieve it slowly. Yet \"fasting\" is not forced—when qi is full and spirit settled, one naturally ceases to eat.\n\nThe *Sūtra of the Buddha’s Former Deeds* says: \"When reaching the southern bank of the Ganges, abide in stability as steady as Mount Sumeru.\" \"Water\" is a clever metaphor in Sanskrit for the refined śarīra. The \"southern bank\" is the Central Palace. Once śarīra returns to the Central Palace, spirit and qi cling like magnet to iron, never parting. Once attained, it is eternally attained—no wandering, no restlessness. Secure and at ease, this is what the Confucians call \"holding fast to the center.\" As deluded consciousness gradually dissolves, true nature gradually awakens. False thoughts vanish; right mindfulness remains. This is what the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* means by \"sitting quietly in a still room, ever dwelling in this thought.\"\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"Practice in accord with the Buddha, receiving a portion of the Buddha’s qi. Like the intermediate state seeking parents, yin and yang mysteriously connect. One enters the lineage of the Tathāgata, called the ‘Noble Birth Abode.’\"\n\nNow \"practice\" does not mean walking or acting—it is the inner work of cultivating the Dao-embryo. Once śarīra returns to the Central Palace, spirit receives this Buddha. Qi is restrained, not wandering; spirit attains stability through qi, qi attains dwelling through spirit. Intimately entwined, they melt and merge into one—this is \"practicing in accord with the Buddha, receiving a portion of the Buddha’s qi.\" Nature belongs to yin—hence the \"yin body.\" The Buddha’s qi is the father; breath is the mother. At this stage, one must not fall into barren stillness. The Buddha’s qi has the principle of vitality; breath has the mechanism of nourishment. One must use nature to seek the complement of these two qi. When the Buddha’s qi arises, guide it back to the source to assist the perfection of the embryo. Breath, ceaseless and subtle, is directed to nourish the embryo’s transformation. This is \"seeking parents on one’s own.\"\n\nYet one must not cling to one and lose the other. At this point, a qi from the great emptiness arrives from the Hall of Light to the Central Palace. I then activate the opening and closing, causing it to circulate throughout the body, expelling all yin qi and transforming it into a purely yang body. The 360 joints and 84,000 pores—none are not penetrated. This is \"yin and yang mysteriously connecting.\" The ordinary body is forgotten; the Dao-embryo remains. A single expanse of celestial, true Buddha-body—this is the \"lineage of the Tathāgata.\" Though dwelling in the Dao-embryo, it is formless and imageless, perfect in samādhi and wisdom—this is the \"Noble Birth Abode.\"\n\nThe World-Honored One said: \"Between the realms of desire and form, he manifests a jeweled hall like a trichiliocosm, expounding the profound Buddha-dharma, that the Dharma may long abide.\"\n\n\"Desire\" and \"form\" are Sanskrit terms from the West; in China they are called the lower and middle elixir fields. Thus the *Śamatha-Vipaśyanā* says: \"In the West, *udāna*; in this land, elixir field.\" \"Manifesting\" is the wondrous function of spirit—the method of nourishing the pathway. Though residing in the middle field, one must combine it with the lower field to transform them into a single empty realm. If spirit clings to the middle field, the Dao-embryo becomes obstructed, and it is no longer a jeweled hall.\n\nThe \"three thousand\" refers to the upper, middle, and lower elixir fields. Common monks mistakenly claim it means the past thousand, present thousand, and future thousand—how absurd! When refining śarīra, one works in the lower field—this is called \"a thousand teachings.\" Yet it must circulate through the upper and middle fields. When nourishing the Dao-embryo, one resides in the middle field for ten months—hence \"that the Dharma may long abide,\" also called \"a thousand teachings.\" Yet it must pass through the upper and lower fields before emerging from samādhi. The upper field is also called \"a thousand teachings.\"\n\nThus it is called the \"three thousand.\" The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: \"Through samādhi, the mind is subdued, ultimately leaving no remainder.\"\n\nNow, samādhi is not the rigid sitting of withered meditation, nor is it the forced suppression of dull emptiness—it is a natural state of stillness. When the *śarīra* returns to the central palace, consciousness dies and true nature awakens, filling one with Dharma joy and Chan bliss, a wondrous and serene delight. Without inside or outside, it coalesces into a single mass—this samādhi is beyond comparison with that of ordinary monks. Radiant as the autumn moon, harmonious in nature; warm as if intoxicated, life suffused with fragrance. With inner vision, the *śarīra* steams and permeates, so that flesh and bone are as if bathed, while the mind and nature resemble the vast sky. Realizing the unconditioned, the six senses rest in tranquility; illuminating the eight consciousnesses, the five aggregates are emptied. Though there is the mechanism of circulation, the true nature remains utterly undisturbed.\n\nThe World-Honored One said: \"Coming in accord with principle, going in accord with principle.\" The preceding passage describes the verification of attaining the *śarīra*; this explains the method of practice at the initial entry onto the path. \"Coming and going\" is a metaphor for the breath. It instructs that when cultivating the Dao-embryo, one must rely on the breath, only then can one depart from birth and leave the realm, reaching quiescence. Thus it is said: \"Coming in accord with principle, going in accord with principle.\"\n\nTherefore, a Chan master said:\n*\"Before reaching the end of water and the exhaustion of mountains,*\n*One must pass the time in good company.\"*\n\nFor when a person leaves the mother’s womb, the breath and primordial *qi* all disperse outward. In daily life and constant practice, the elixir field is originally empty. Only when the breath within the embryo is understood, and spirit congeals while *qi* abides, can the *śarīra* be refined and return here. Yet the breath must also return here. Primordial *qi* is the root of forming the embryo; breath is the source of nourishing the path. One must also know to use the mind to govern and stabilize the breath. Before the breath is stabilized, the mind regulates it. If the breath is not regulated, it will not stabilize, and the Dao cannot be realized.\n\nAt the initial entry into the embryo, how can the method of regulating the breath be lacking? \"Coming in accord with principle, going in accord with principle\"—this is the meaning of regulating the breath. This is what was imparted to the great bodhisattvas:\n*\"Why did the six years on Snow Mountain come to pass?*\n*With resolve firm, harmonizing *qi* and spirit,*\n*In a hundred moments, all becomes one breath—*\n*Only then does the great Dao manifest the Three Vehicles.\"*\n\nThe Tathāgata spoke of \"the *nirvāṇa* with remainder.\" \"Remainder\" refers to the remaining breath. When first entering the Dao-embryo, the mind relies on the breath, and the breath follows the mind—neither hurried nor sluggish, allowing it to flow naturally. Yet one must not let it drift into dissipation or disorder, oblivious to the true breath within. The embryo originally possesses breath, and though it may seem as if there is no breath, it is not truly absent but actually present.\n\nThus, the *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* explains:\n*\"Who knows who arranges it by force?*\n*Gathered together, then released again.*\n*Do not say the Tathāgata has attained extinction—*\n*One sound follows another in succession.\"*\nThis is the meaning of the mind and breath relying on each other.\n\nThe *Brahmajāla Sūtra* and *Śīla Sūtra* state: \"Abiding in the one truth of *tathatā*, one practices the emptiness of non-arising. All buddhas and sages dwell equally in the emptiness of non-arising.\" \"Abiding in the one truth of *tathatā*\" refers to the mechanism by which primordial *qi* and postnatal breath intermingle and connect, steaming and nourishing the source of the embryo—neither hurried nor sluggish, proceeding in accord with *tathatā*. Nowadays, those who engage in seven-day meditation retreats and call it \"abiding in truth\"—is this not a mistake?\n\nThus, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says:\n*\"The great immortal path of the Tathāgata*\n*Is subtle and wondrous, difficult to know.\"*\nWhen in the state of steaming and blending, spirit and *qi* merge completely, as if bathed or intoxicated, flesh and bone harmonize. Between the realms of desire and form, without attachment or stagnation, empty and open—thus it is called the emptiness of non-arising.\n\nThe World-Honored One said: \"The *tathāgatagarbha* is empty yet not empty.\" The preceding passage speaks of the emptiness of non-arising, yet it also guards against the error of annihilationism. Thus it is said: \"empty yet not empty\"—this is quiescence that is ever-illuminating. \"Not empty\" guards against the error of eternalism—\"not empty yet as if empty\"—this is illumination that is ever-quiescent.\n\nDīpaṃkara Buddha said: \"When arising and ceasing have ceased.\" \"Arising and ceasing have ceased\" means that the breath within the embryo comes to utmost stillness, yet the principle of expansion and contraction still remains—thus it is called \"arising and ceasing.\" One must guard and bring it to the point where no trace of expansion or contraction remains—thus it is called \"have ceased.\" Knowing only spirit and not the *qi* within the embryo is called \"the myriad dharmas return to the One.\" The method of realizing the mind must rely on the embryo to abide. What is meant by \"returning to the Dharma\" is returning to this.\n\nWithout the Dao-embryo *śarīra* and the true primordial *qi*, forcibly abiding the mind and calling it \"have ceased\" is delusion for those who claim to realize the Dao. The *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* states: \"Bodhisattvas should dwell as they have been taught.\" When bodhisattvas cultivate buddhahood, the mind must dwell as they have been taught, only then can they realize buddhahood. Thus, the sūtra says: \"If bodhisattvas wish to cultivate buddhahood, they should dwell as the Buddha has taught.\" \"Taught\" refers to the Dao-embryo. To attain the full realization of the Dao-embryo’s position, one must first stabilize the mind. The key to stabilizing the mind is to abide in the samādhi of true breath. With stabilization, one does not fall into the six sense realms or follow delusion—thus, with correct samādhi, correct awakening is achieved.\n\nThis is what the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* means by \"the first dhyāna abiding in mindfulness, the second dhyāna abiding in breath.\" The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"Having roamed in the Dao-embryo, one reverently attends to awakening.\" This describes spirit entering *qi* and *qi* enveloping spirit, profound and silent, dim and deep—like the scene within a mother’s womb. Hence it is called the Dao-embryo. It is also said: \"Before the parents’ birth, one creates and transforms oneself, possessing the great *dhāraṇī*.\" Thus it is called \"reverently attending to awakening.\"\n\nThe *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* says: \"Bodhisattvas, with respect to dharmas, should practice generosity without abiding.\"\n\nHaving regulated the mind as described earlier, one must first abide in embryonic breathing. Once the mind is settled, one must not cling to the breath; if one clings to it moment after moment, abiding in the presence of breath, then the breath will bind the mind just as the six senses bind it—this is a mind that has not attained liberation. Thus it is said: \"With respect to dharmas, one should practice generosity without abiding.\" Here, the dharma is the breath. Once the mind has settled, one should relinquish the breath. As the ancient worthies said: \"To cross the river, one needs a raft; upon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer needed.\" The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: \"Abiding in the tranquility of all samādhis, wisdom enters the deathless Way.\" \"Abiding in the tranquility of all samādhis\" means the nostrils emit no breath, the six pulses in both hands are all stilled, and one enters great samādhi, utterly free from arising and ceasing—this is what the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* calls \"the third dhyāna, where the pulses abide.\" With all the sense faculties stilled, one attains constant bliss and the true self. \"Tranquil wisdom\" is the true awakening within samādhi. Abiding in tranquility, samādhi perfects correct and equal awakening—the deathless Way that the true person has personally realized. The World-Honored One spoke of \"the remainderless *nirvāṇa*.\" \"Remainderless\" means the absence of exhalation and inhalation. \"*Nirvāṇa*\" does not mean death; it is the bliss of samādhi and *samāpatti*. With the six senses extinguished and all conditions ungrasped, the one nature is perfectly fused, wisdom’s light shines clearly, and the dharma-realm is empty—this is the wondrous state of remainderless *nirvāṇa*. It is what the Tathāgata meant by \"clearly not receiving the prediction from Dīpaṃkara, for one’s own numinous light illumines past and present.\" The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: \"Ever with pure mindfulness, abide in supreme awakening.\" \"Pure mindfulness\" means not abiding in defiled delusion nor in the fetters of dharmas—it is the unarising, unceasing, correct mindfulness within samādhi, what the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* calls \"the fourth dhyāna and the extinction of all outflows.\" \"Supreme awakening\" is the perfect and complete awakening of the Buddha-Way, where wisdom’s light shines brightly without day or night, where great freedom is attained and the six supernormal powers are fully realized—this is truly called supreme awakening. Yet when mindfulness abides, wisdom naturally arises and illuminates; one must guard wisdom and not employ it. If one does not maintain samādhi but clings to the mind of attainment, employing it will lead to demonic states, where the discriminating mind causes harm and all prior merit is lost. Thus Dīpaṃkara Buddha said: \"Quiescence is bliss.\" \"Quiescence\" does not mean death; it is the true realization of the embryo’s nature fully penetrated. Therefore, the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When the Way of awakening is perfectly complete, the Buddha-nature’s manifestation is quiescent and still, while wisdom shines clearly; radiant and luminous, samādhi and awakening are non-doing. The mind is free from delusion, the nature is free from arising and ceasing—this is what the Sixth Patriarch called 'the mind of meditation without thought, the nature of meditation without arising.' The six pulses are entirely absent, the breath through the nostrils is extinguished—hence it is called quiescence. The embryo of the Dao and the Buddha-nature merge like the rising sun—thus it is called bliss.\" It is also called \"true emptiness and non-doing.\" At this stage, when snowflakes drift in the sky, the signs of emerging from samādhi appear. If one shifts attention beyond Mount Sumeru before attaining great samādhi, no signs of emergence will manifest. To emerge rashly is to enter demonic paths; to have signs appear yet not emerge is to become a corpse-guarding ghost, devoid of the wisdom of supernormal powers—merely another foolish person. Thus Maitreya Buddha said: \"Though you endure for eighty thousand kalpas, in the end you fall into emptiness and perish.\" Therefore, I say: the wondrous method of passing the *śarīra* through the barrier is to illuminate with stillness and act with softness. The path is perilous—guard against scattering above and below. Wait for movement, then guide with softness and proceed with care. Warm with gentle fire, nourish with the two *qi*, cultivate stillness and illumination together, and settle into dual forgetting—thus the method of the Dao-embryo is attained. This reiterates the method of nurturing the Dao with the *śarīra*. Moreover, \"still illumination\" is the proper practice for obtaining the *śarīra*. Without stillness, it will not arise; without illumination, it will not emerge from the furnace. How can the method of still illumination for obtaining the *śarīra* be neglected? Thus the World-Honored One said: \"Where the mind and eyes are focused lies the perilous path.\" The yang pass, the anus, and the nostrils are the places where outflows are exhausted. One must first use the dharma-vessel to restrain and protect against the danger of these three apertures. Without a true teacher’s transmission, one will surely lose and perish in reckless wandering here. Only by guiding and opening, moving and proceeding together, entrusting the mind to vigilant protection, can one be said to \"skillfully guard the precious pearl.\" At this time, it is like crossing a small bridge. Thus it is said: wait for movement, then proceed; proceed with softness and care. The embryo relies on the *qi* of the *śarīra*, just as if it were not nurtured by breathing. The Buddha-child emerging from samādhi is like the fetus in the mother’s womb, formed by the two *qi* and nurtured by breathing. When the mother exhales, the fetus exhales; when the mother inhales, the fetus inhales—so too with the Dao-embryo. When the Dao-embryo is first formed, it relies on the fire of breathing for warmth and nurture. By the fifth or sixth month, the two *qi* gradually diminish, and by the eighth or ninth month, the two *qi* are entirely stilled—one knows only spirit and not *qi*. If one becomes empty at this time and remains utterly vacant, one falls into the view of annihilation. Thus, emptiness must yet seem non-empty—this is true quiescence that is ever-illuminating. If one knows only non-emptiness and remains solely in that state, one falls into the view of eternalism. Thus, non-emptiness must yet seem empty—this is true illumination that is ever-quiescent. Upon attaining great samādhi, perfectly merged as one, the signs of emerging from samādhi will appear. The true instructions above have never been clearly spoken throughout the ages; they have been inverted and metaphorically expressed, making them difficult to comprehend. I have assembled and arranged them step by step to complete the meaning—truly the boat and ladder for learners of the Buddha-Way through ten thousand generations. Have you not heard the words of the fifty-scroll *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*?\n\nThe World-Honored One emitted great radiance from the white curl between his brows, called the \"Manifestation of the Tathāgata.\" What follows describes the signs of emerging from samādhi. The preceding text spoke only of nurturing the embryo, yet the moment of emergence from samādhi remained unclear. Fearing that later generations would not grasp this principle, the Tathāgata, out of great compassion, declared that from the light of the white curl would arise the evidence for all ages to come. For the celestial mechanism of emerging from samādhi is not something ordinary monks can attain. From the Han dynasty until now, who among those seen by others has truly known it? This is the verification of the Tathāgata’s own realization when emerging from samādhi. At that moment, one may emit white light or golden light; when the original nature perceives something, one should immediately seek a teacher to apply the method of gathering the light. If the light is not gathered, it will scatter. The formed cannot transform into the formless; though the nature is wondrous, the form is not—this is not the complete Dharma of the World-Honored One and Bodhidharma’s quiescent non-being. Learners must urgently seek a teacher, lest they miss this opportunity, for it will never come again.\n\nMaster Jixu of Quiescent Non-being said:\nWhen the embryo is complete and the season arrives, snowflakes fly,\nThought stirs and drifts toward the sky’s mechanism.\nDo not say the Tathāgata’s Way is barren quiescence—\nThe Dharmakāya emerges from quiescence and returns to refuge.\n\nThis describes the moment of emerging from samādhi: if one should emerge but does not, one becomes stagnant in the Dharmakāya, bound by samādhi, unable to attain supernatural powers or manifest a hundred billion transformation bodies. \"When the embryo is complete and the season arrives\" refers to the perfection of the Dao-embryo. Seeing snowflakes depart the mortal body, with thought stirring toward the great void—if one does not recognize this mechanism, one has not found a true teacher. Nowadays, in the monasteries, monks sit in dry meditation, gathering the mind as the Way, exalting themselves and deceiving donors and disciples. They mislead themselves and others, unaware of the Tathāgata’s white light or the ancestral snowflakes. They merely rely on the Buddha’s teachings for shelter, consuming the faithful offerings of donors while forgetting the great kindness of their parents. Born with a male body, standing tall beneath heaven and earth, if they do not awaken to this Dao, are they not pitiful?\n\nWhen the Dharmakāya emerges from samādhi and departs the mortal frame, it must swiftly return to the Niwan Palace to nurture purity for another seven days before emerging again. At the first emergence, one may see wondrous visions of buddhas, ancestors, or bodhisattvas—these must not be acknowledged, for they are transformations of Māra. If recognized, one will be led astray, losing one’s own body without refuge. Since the Buddha-fruit is not yet perfected and one cannot stand firm, how can one be reborn in later ages? One must cultivate through the nine grounds, reaching the tenth ground, and further uphold the eleventh ground of Equal Enlightenment to transcend the formless realm.\n\nAt the first emergence, when the light appears three to five feet from the body, one must not be startled or alarmed; nothing should be acknowledged. Only when a golden light as large as a chariot wheel appears should one direct thought into the light, gathering it into the nature—this is the wondrous foundation of transforming form. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"Form emerges from the embryo, becoming a true child of the Buddha.\" After ten months of nurturing the Dao-embryo, receiving the nourishment of the two qi, when the embryo is complete and the nature is settled, this is called \"emerging from samādhi with formed body.\" Wisdom becomes vast, seeing and knowing all, appearing and disappearing at will. When gathered, it takes form; when scattered, it has no origin. Its light pervades the Dharma realm, and gods and spirits protect it—thus it is called a child of the Buddha.\n\nThe *Lotus Sūtra* says: \"The World-Honored One emitted white light from his brow, illuminating eighteen thousand worlds to the east, pervading all without exception. From the Avīci Hell below to the Akaniṣṭha Heaven above, the south, west, and north were all equally illuminated.\" When the Dharmakāya emerges from samādhi for a long time, there is nothing it does not see, as if in the palm of its hand. The Akaniṣṭha Heaven is the name of the summit of the form realm, the Heaven of Ultimate Form. When the Dao-embryo is perfected after ten months of samādhi, one’s merit and practice reach this heaven—thus, upon emerging from samādhi, one naturally arrives here. Seeing the four directions, above and below, is not by deliberate effort but arises spontaneously.\n\nThe Great Awakened Golden Immortal Tathāgata said: \"From the flesh-crown, a hundred-jeweled light surged forth, and from the light emerged a thousand-petaled jeweled lotus, with a transformation Tathāgata seated within the flower.\" This is the passage from the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* recited morning and evening, yet ordinary monks do not know its origin and recite it in vain. The Golden Immortal is how the World-Honored One refers to himself in the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, sometimes called the Great Immortal, the Seven Immortals, or the Assembly of Immortals—there is no fixed name.\n\nLiaoran asked: \"Buddhist monks today regard immortals as a lesser path. Why then does the Tathāgata call himself by these four immortal names?\" The answer: \"The Buddha originally makes no distinction between self and other; such distinctions are made by ordinary monks. When the Tathāgata calls himself the Four Immortals, it is precisely to prevent cultivators of the Way from clinging to sectarian divisions, guiding all to return to the Tathāgata’s wisdom-life Dao.\"\n\nLiaoran further asked: \"The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* speaks of ten kinds of immortals whose rewards are exhausted and who fall again—why is this?\" The answer: \"The ten spirit-immortals fall because, when they began their practice, they did not follow the wisdom-life Dao but pursued peripheral, lesser methods. Thus, their attainment is also a lesser fruit, and so they fall. If one begins with the wisdom-life, one is not called one of the ten immortals but a Golden Immortal. Moreover, gold corresponds to the west and is in fact qi. Qi pertains to yang, while spirit pertains to yin. When yin obtains this yang, it becomes a yang-spirit—visible to others and capable of grasping objects. A yin-spirit is invisible to others and cannot grasp objects.\"\n\nThe World-Honored One said: \"Upon first attaining perfect enlightenment, he entered the dragon palace and abided in samādhi for seven days. He appeared beneath the bodhi tree and abided in samādhi for seven days. By the second and third seven-day periods, in the grove of milk trees, he abided in samādhi for seven times seven—forty-nine days—without eating.\"\n\nWhen first emerging from samādhi, he nurtured himself for another seven days before emerging again, then another fourteen days before emerging again, then twenty-one days before emerging again, and finally forty-nine days before emerging once more.\n\n\"Milk\" is a Sanskrit term from the western regions. In this land, it is called \"nurturing with milk,\" likened to a child emerging from the mother’s womb—though possessing human form, it cannot walk far or speak, and fully depends on the mother’s grace, nourished day and night with milk, before it can walk and speak on its own, its wisdom expanding boundlessly. So too is it with the Buddha’s disciples after emerging from samādhi. The day-and-night nurturing with milk occurs in the mud-womb; here, without eating or drinking, one cultivates and expands wisdom, transforming one into two, two into three, and endlessly multiplying. Thus it is said there are a thousand, a hundred million transformation bodies.\n\nSomeone may ask: *The* Five Lamps Meeting at the Source *calls entering samādhi an external path—does this not make what is spoken of here an external path as well?* The answer is: When *Meeting at the Source* speaks of entering samādhi as an external path, it refers to those who have not attained the wisdom-life or the dharma-emptiness of the śarīra, merely gathering the mind into samādhi—this is the calculation of the yin-spirit, not the yang-spirit, hence it is called an external path. What the World-Honored One speaks of here is entering samādhi after attaining the wisdom-life and forming the śarīra within the dharma-womb, after emerging from the womb. *Meeting at the Source* fails to distinguish these methods, thus mixing them into one statement and misleading later generations. Moreover, the Sixth Patriarch’s wisdom-life Dao is truly secret and has not been transmitted. What has been passed down is nothing but the solitary nature, hence they do not know of the World-Honored One’s forty-nine-day samādhi practice. If one does not understand the World-Honored One’s wisdom-life dharma-womb and calls entering samādhi an external path, how could the World-Honored One have initially practiced an external path? And how could later generations dare to call him the Most Honored One! The World-Honored One also said: *In eighty thousand kalpas, there is but one samādhi*—is this also an external path? This passage speaks of the forty-nine days without food as the World-Honored One’s own realization. If one cannot even go three days without food, what is there to discuss? Those who study the Buddha-Dao should quickly seek a teacher to point out the wisdom-life śarīra dharma-womb, so that they may have hope. Otherwise, ten refinements will leave nine empty, and they will wither away of their own accord, becoming nothing more than solitary spirits of discriminating consciousness.\n\nThe World-Honored One said: *The Dharma of protective mindfulness now abides long.* This refers to returning to the mud-pill palace, the work of nurturing with milk. The earlier mention of \"milk\" is the method of protective mindfulness. \"Abiding long\" means the true thought should reside in the mud-pill palace, hence it is called the Great Samādhi.\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: *Though having realized quiescent extinction, diligently cultivate practice, and you will transcend the unshakable ground of space. The Buddha urges one to arise from quiescent extinction and broadly cultivate all kinds of wisdom-activities.* The earlier mention of \"abiding long\" means that after attaining the cessation of arising and ceasing, one enters quiescent extinction. Though in quiescent extinction, one must continue cultivation to achieve long-lasting quiescence, like adding space upon space, reaching the utterly unshakable ground. The Buddha instructs: *From the initial attainment of quiescent extinction, one must diligently cultivate practice, advancing in wisdom without cease.* Empty and yet again empty, void and yet again void—thus it is said: *When the realm of space is exhausted, my cultivation will still have no end.*\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* also says: *Abiding perpetually in nirvāṇa, like space.* The nature is like space, not clinging to the appearance of space—hence it is called \"space.\" If one clings to the appearance of space, then there is a \"space\" that exists, and one is hindered by space, no longer being space. Space is thus naturally so, not something that is made to be so—hence it is said \"like space.\" It also says: *The mind is constantly in right samādhi, extinguishing the arising of awareness, yet manifesting with the wisdom of omniscience. From this unshakable state, one enters the formless samādhi.* This again speaks of returning to the nature of emptiness. When one reaches the realm of space, the true mind is constantly in samādhi, all wisdom-observations extinguished, utterly boundless. One may remain in samādhi for three years, or nine years—within, a single golden light of true fire is concealed. Over days and months, the ordinary body also transforms into qi, and as the spirit becomes wondrous, so too does the form.\n\nLike the World-Honored One after entering nirvāṇa: his mother came, weeping in sorrow, rising into empty space, and he preached the Dharma to her. Like Bodhidharma after entering nirvāṇa in Shaolin: he returned west with only one sandal, and on the road, he personally bid farewell to a minister, sending a message back to Shaolin. When the minister returned to the temple and opened the coffin, there was no body inside—only an empty coffin. Like Master Jiwu in Taiyi: his ordinary body transformed into a hundred thousand forms, vanishing without a trace when hidden. Sometimes he gave people gold and silver, sometimes beautiful women; sometimes he manifested as tigers or dragons, or traveled ten thousand miles in an instant. The Chan master concealed himself in Mount Lu, returning to emptiness—this is the constantly abiding mind, how could it be lacking? Thus the World-Honored One said: *In eighty thousand kalpas, there is but one samādhi.*\n\nThe *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* says: *The Tathāgata’s perfect enlightenment.* Perfect enlightenment means the true nature returns to emptiness, reaching the ultimate of the void. Neither ordinary nor sacred, neither day nor night—one nature, the great void. As Shaozi said: *The Dao extends beyond the formed world of heaven and earth; thought enters the transformations of wind and clouds.* When heaven and earth perish in kalpas, this alone does not perish. Thus the *Amitābha Sūtra* speaks of *ten kalpas since attaining Buddhahood.*\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: *The dharma-nature is like space; all buddhas dwell within it.* Since the nature is like space, there is nothing to be done. Yet it also says *dwelling within it*—there is truly a principle of returning. Many do not awaken to this, failing to realize that this is the wondrous method of refining emptiness, the secret of the true nature returning to the central palace. This central palace is what the Tathāgata calls the *ocean of Vairocana’s nature*. Dwelling the true nature in this nature-ocean is like nurturing a dragon pearl—untouched by anything. Relying on the samādhi of complete extinction, one enters quiescence. Even if there is light, it is gathered and concealed. In samādhi upon samādhi, over time, the nature-light transforms into a śarīra. Light bursts forth from the nature-ocean, transforming into ten thousand, a hundred million rays of fine light, piercing the great void and meeting with the ancient buddhas and tathāgatas.\n\nThus, Great Awakening Chan Master said:\n*A single śarīra radiates brilliance,\nIlluminating boundless kalpas without end,\nThe great chiliocosm all returns to refuge.*\n\nMoreover, Heze Chan Master said:\n*The original face is true suchness,\nIn the śarīra’s light, one recognizes it.\nAfter ten thousand kalpas lost in delusion, now at last awakened,\nOnly then does one know one’s own nature is Mañjuśrī—\nJust so.*\n\nThe foregoing all speaks of the śarīra’s passage through the barrier, the wondrous method of nurturing the Dao-embryo, emerging from samādhi, and returning to emptiness. Is not the Way of wisdom-life entirely herein?\n\nI dare not claim this compilation as my own discourse on the wondrous Dao; it is all a gathering of the true transmissions of former sages. For those in future kalpas who aspire with determination, it is the root of awakening to the Buddha-Way and cultivating the wisdom-life. May those who encounter it immediately awaken and realize it, aligning with the true intent of the buddhas and patriarchs, thereby perfecting themselves and others—thus attaining the fruition of the Buddha-Way.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Direct Discourse on Cultivating the Orthodox Dao**\n\nHuayang said: To cultivate is to break and then mend the whole.\nFor humans are born possessing the complete body of nature and life, yet in their prime, when qi is full, it naturally leaks. Before breaking occurs, if one encounters an enlightened teacher’s guidance, one need not employ the method of mending—one may instantly transcend and directly enter the Tathāgata’s ground. For those already broken, one must mend to restore the complete body.\n\nMoreover, in mending, one must rely on the dynamic mechanism to gather the outwardly dispersed qi and replenish the deficient qi. When qi is fully restored and the generative mechanism ceases to move, the appearance of the \"hidden horse\" emerges—this is called the \"immortal arhat.\"\n\nTo refine is to transform things with fire.\nAnd the \"thing\" is none other than one’s original qi. Though original qi is stored in the qi-cavern, when it moves outward, it becomes the resource of leakage. Now that it has returned to the source, one employs fire to transform it back into qi.\n\nFire does not burn without wind.\nThe preceding text spoke of using fire to transform things, but if one does not know to employ wind, the thing will be difficult to transform. Thus, one must use the breath—inhale and exhale—to blow the fire, so that the thing may be transformed into qi.\n\nThings have no place without a dwelling.\nThe dwelling is the qi-cavern. When things arise, they originally emerge from the qi-cavern; now they return to the qi-cavern, and fire and wind are also applied here. Therefore, the perfected one investigates the great Dao, cultivates nature and life, and unifies the loci of wind, fire, and thing in simultaneous use. Directing the intent into the qi-cavern and reversing the breath to blow it—is this not their simultaneous use?\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, those who have accomplished the Dao have all taken this as essential. From a thousand ages past to a thousand ages hence, for this person with this mind who seeks to accomplish the Dao, there is nothing but nature and life. And the union of nature and life is nothing but wind and fire—this is what is meant by \"there is no second Dao under heaven, no second mind in the sage.\"\n\nAlas, those who know this are few, while those who remain ignorant are many. Moreover, among those in the world who study Buddhism, some recite sutras and prostrate to the Buddha daily, others receive precepts and study scriptures, and the most advanced engage in Chan meditation and seated practice. Yet when it comes to the two words \"nature\" and \"life,\" scarcely anyone in the world understands them. Clinging to nature while neglecting life, unaware of movement and stillness, they often grow old in vain.\n\nFor today’s Buddhist practitioners believe that the Buddha cultivated nature but not life, unaware that the Tathāgata’s great treasury of teachings advocates the dual cultivation of nature and life. Being and non-being are originally employed together, yet they cling to dead Chan, ignorant of the dynamic mechanism. Beginners may resemble the Buddha, but over time, finding no efficacy, they grow disheartened and abandon their practice—dying in vain, what benefit is there?\n\nWhen life moves, it dissipates outward; when exhausted, alas, where does nature reside? Where does the Dao abide?\n\nThose in the Buddhist world today, not having received the Tathāgata’s true transmission, cling to nature while ignorant of the treasure of life. When the wisdom-life stirs, not knowing the method to gather and stabilize it, even if it does not transform into leakage, it naturally scatters. When exhausted, how can there be no death? Once dead, what remains to be called the Dao?\n\nThus, the perfected one observes the ebb and flow of movement and stillness, uniting them in dual cultivation. Moreover, when worldly people seek to cultivate, they immediately leave behind parents, spouse, and children, secluding themselves in remote mountains or grand monasteries, believing that stillness alone can cultivate the Dao—how laughable!\n\nIf one seeks the true transmission yet remains in such barren stillness, ignorant of the dynamic mechanism, it is like a foolish cat guarding an empty burrow—what benefit is there? Therefore, Radiant Tathāgata of Purple Gold said: \"Without discerning movement and stillness, studying the Dao is futile.\"\n\nThe perfected one quiets the mind to await the movement of the kidneys. Shifting to the locus of movement, one unites and refines them—when heart and kidneys merge, this is the union of nature and life. Thus, the ancients said: \"The one unified appearance is precisely this.\"\n\nThe root of life lies in the kidneys; when the kidneys move, it is water. Life is original qi; when qi moves, it transforms into water. The root of nature lies in the heart; when the heart moves, it is fire. Nature is true intent; when intent moves, it transforms into fire.\n\nDirect fire into water.\nDirect the intent from the heart into the qi of the kidneys—thus the wisdom-life does not dissipate outward. When qi is stabilized by intent, it no longer races outward.\n\nUse wind to blow fire and transform it into the true seed.\nWind is the breath of inhalation and exhalation; fire is intent. The preceding text spoke of qi being stabilized by intent, so it no longer races outward. Yet within it, the lingering shadows of leakage remain untransformed. Therefore, one must employ the breath—reversing the inhalation and exhalation—to blow the fire in the furnace, transforming these lingering shadows of leakage into qi. Otherwise, this thing will stir up trouble, disturbing the sovereign mind with thoughts of desire and passion—what Mencius called \"qi can also move the will.\"\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* also refers to this as \"yin demons.\" One must refine them ceaselessly over a long duration, transforming these yin demons into yang light. Then body and mind will naturally be at peace, and emotions and desires will naturally be unable to disturb.\n\nThis is what the World-Honored One meant by \"entering the fire of samādhi to subdue the fire dragon.\" This is the esoteric teaching of both the Daoist and Buddhist traditions. Those of sincere aspiration who obtain it and refine it according to the method will find its power effective—desires will dissolve without effort, and the mind will settle without striving. This is what is meant by \"using the Dao to govern the mind, so the mind naturally aligns with the Dao.\" Such is the Dao.\n\nThose who practice it long enough will suddenly awaken the celestial mechanism, generating existence from non-existence—this is called the \"true seed.\" The method is simple and easy. All that is difficult to cultivate and hard to accomplish belongs to external paths. If one is destined to encounter this Dao, it is supremely simple and effortless—what is called \"at eighty, meeting the true Dao and attaining it.\"\n\nThose who awaken refine the true seed into śarīra. Awakening is not without method or transmission, as in today’s Chan schools, which vainly teach people to contemplate emptiness—this is mistaken. Here, there is genuine practice and true transmission, teaching one to turn the hand and gather the true seed, refining it into śarīra.\n\nIn stillness, await the moment. Before the mechanism stirs, remain in stillness and wait.\n\nWhen movement arises, gather it. Once the mechanism stirs, use intention to collect it. Refine it in the same crucible. Intention and qi merge as one—this is called \"fire transformation.\" The World-Honored One termed it \"fire transformation,\" walking the Tathāgata’s path. The path refers to the Conception and Governing Vessels, also called the Wheel of Dharma’s route. Abiding beneath the World-Honored One’s tree—this \"tree\" signifies the pure land of the cinnabar field. Long ago, the World-Honored One cultivated and refined beneath the bodhi tree, entering samādhi precisely here. This is called \"movement and abiding.\" As Chan Master Daoyi said, \"There is no movement without abiding, no position without movement\"—this is it. Moreover, the movement and abiding of fire truly follow the transformations of things. When things move, intention must also move; when things abide, intention must also abide.\n\nWhen yin demons appear, immediately apply the martial fire to refine them, averting the peril of dissipation and leakage. These yin demons are the yin qi within the body. Their manifestations—whether visions of yin beings in dreams, bodily obstructions, apparitions of yin figures during meditation, or dreams of tigers and monsters—are all transformations of yin qi, the corrupting ailments that leak śarīra. One must fiercely refine them with wind and fire, burning until ghosts wail and spirits howl within, exhausting the yin demons before danger is averted. Then, in purity, tranquility, and great peace, gently nurture and warmly cultivate to fortify the protection of the precious pearl. The body remains free of strange visions, with intention overseeing and nurturing.\n\nWhen turning the Wheel of Dharma, employ both civil and martial methods in tandem. The subtleties and profound mysteries therein depend on the master’s transmission and one’s own awakening. The practice of turning the Wheel of Dharma involves ascent and descent as martial, bathing as civil—yet within ascent and descent, both civil and martial are present. All hinges on the master’s transmission, while the subtleties lie in self-realization.\n\nWhen śarīra forms, cease the martial and apply the civil’s gentle accumulation. As śarīra takes shape, use the civil fire to gather it. If one fails to stop and continues with martial fire, the formed śarīra will be dispersed by its force—this is a critical danger, most essential to recognize. This is called \"warm cultivation,\" truly likened to preservation.\n\nWhen śarīra forms, halt the martial fire of breath and employ the civil fire of spirit-light’s reflection. True intention must constantly oversee and protect it, guarding against peril. At that time—when śarīra is about to emerge—the luminous pearl appears and a hundred demons vanish. The luminous pearl is śarīra. Once śarīra forms, it manifests clearly, while the hundred demons are the body’s yin qi and chronic ailments. With the pearl’s appearance, yin qi and chronic afflictions instantly dissolve—hence, they are said to vanish.\n\nGently traverse the great path of Caoxi. Caoxi refers to the marrow path of the spine. When gathering śarīra, one must proceed along this path with softness and slowness. If it rushes along another route, śarīra cannot be obtained. Once the Dao-embryo is established, a thousand wisdoms arise. As śarīra returns to the central palace, white hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow, and wisdom expands boundlessly—past and future become fully known. Yet one must beware: this wisdom must not be misused.\n\nWarm cultivation is indeed the verification of settled wisdom, like an unshaken proof.\n\nWhen one reaches this stage, all is nurtured by the gentle fire of refinement, with nothing lost. This is what is meant by \"once verified, forever verified\"—constantly abiding in self-awareness at the center, with wisdom illuminating the sea of nature. Yet wisdom must not be employed; one must diligently cultivate *dhyāna*. For *dhyāna* is stillness, and *nā* is nature. At this stage, one cultivates only one’s own settled nature, regulating one’s own breath and fire. All perceptions—past and future fortunes and misfortunes—are known but must not be used. The radiance of numinous wisdom thus grows ever brighter. When wisdom is not employed, the nature of the Dao-embryo becomes increasingly numinous and penetrating. Serene illumination brings constant self-awakening, and the body transcends the regrets of torpor and distraction. This speaks of stillness that is ever luminous. *Awakening* means knowing. Within *samādhi*, one must possess right awakening and insight before once more perceiving the nature-body. As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says, \"Ever abide in pure mindfulness, dwelling in supreme awakening.\" If one follows torpor, the embryo has no breath and falls into ignorance, becoming akin to the lifeless emptiness of externalist paths. If one follows distraction, the embryo has no master, the fire cools, the qi is exhausted, and nothing is accomplished. The power of steadfastness lies in the sincerity of a single thought within emptiness-nature. For the embryo’s steadfast power resides in the sincerity of a single thought. Over ten months, the embryo must be held in thought after thought, with the breath settled and the thought stabilized—only then will the embryo be complete. As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says, \"Abide in tranquil stillness, with all the wisdom of *samādhi*, entering the deathless Way.\"\n\nWhen the nature of dharma is settled, snowflakes swirl in chaos. Within the quiet chamber, one may suddenly see snowflakes flying—this is the time of the embryo’s kingdom. This is called emerging from *samādhi*. When the signs of emergence appear, one must emerge. If one does not, one becomes stagnant within the embryo, lacking the transformations of spiritual powers and wisdom. Though the embryo may be complete, one remains but a fool. For within the extreme stillness of the great Dao, a dynamic impulse arises—what is called \"the jade sight restored at midnight, the true essence once more stirring at its utmost.\" This *essence* is the supreme yang substance. When this essence reaches the extreme of stillness, it stirs of itself. For yang has no principle of total exhaustion. When the perfected one creates anew like the sun and moon, aligning emotions with nature, they turn and unite. This is called \"re-creating the wondrous Dao, re-establishing precepts, *samādhi*, and wisdom.\" This stage of practice was concealed by the ancients, either to avoid leaking celestial secrets or because those who had not attained it were unworthy. For all cultivators who gather this essence within, the dharma-body that emerges from *samādhi* must also be returned within, merging into one and entering great *samādhi*. Unceasing *samādhi* leads to the infinite and the utmost.\n\n**Direct Discussion of the Dao’s Work, Chapter Eleven**\nMaster Huayang says: When practicing, one must be in a quiet chamber. A quiet chamber is a place far from idle company, lest they disturb one’s stillness. The body is like withered wood—when sitting, one forgets form. The mind is like cold ashes—when still, one forgets the mind. Employ the numinous light, turning it inward to illuminate. Merge nature and life into the same palace, guiding nature into the palace of life. This is called the beginning of the Dao. For when one cultivates nature, life is already within it—hence, it is called the beginning.\n\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises. When one attains true stillness, an impulse suddenly stirs within—this is neither the ordinary mind nor intention, but the stirring of qi in the cinnabar field. The Fifth Patriarch called it \"when emotion comes,\" and the Sixth Patriarch called it \"lustful mind,\" which is the Dao-mind. For Buddhist practitioners, if one does not recognize this stirring, there is no place to begin, and cultivation is futile. This is the root and sprout of the great Dao. The buddhas and patriarchs, knowing this impulse arises, use methods to gather it back into the cinnabar field, refining it into a *śarīra*, transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood—hence, it is called cultivating the root and sprout of the great Dao. This is the master of creation. Yet ordinary people, not knowing cultivation, cannot control this stirring when it arises, and the mind also moves—what Mencius called \"qi can also move the will.\" Thus, when men and women unite, they give birth to human beings, and all things likewise arise from this stirring, as yin and yang naturally combine. Worldly people, out of their own lust, call those who cultivate the Dao lustful, truly unaware of the method. The buddhas and patriarchs wait for this impulse to stir, and before the mind can turn to thought, they refine it with fire and fan it with wind. The external organ retracts, the mind becomes as cool as water—what lust could there be? Even the tiniest creatures like the pyralid moth or louse have no lustful mind. This is the transformative nurturing of the Dao, the true impulse of heaven and earth, arising naturally, not by deliberate intent. The transformations of sages all lie in this interplay of compliance and reversal.\n\nQi revolves and the aperture opens. Qi, as the ancients called it, is also named *essence*, *water*, or *the affair of the inner chamber*—its designations are many. The aperture is the cinnabar field, the qi cavity. The opening is the Gate of Life. Medical texts mistakenly place it between the two kidneys, but it is actually below the navel. In women, it is called the uterine gate—this is the same. Where men and women discharge essence is precisely this place.\n\nThe emotions of the wisdom-life incline outward. For *wisdom-life* is the Buddha’s skillful metaphor, what in China is called *original qi*. From the moment of conception, one receives the qi of the master of creation, which resides within, and the buddha-nature is also there. This is what is meant by \"what is mandated by heaven is called nature.\" It connects the eight vessels to the mother’s breath, while the mouth and nose have no qi. At the moment of birth, when the mouth and nose open, the eight vessels close, and the original qi is stored within. In maturity, the original qi gathers at the pass and emerges.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls this the attainment of the \"leakage-exhausting penetration.\" Once the aperture is opened, the mechanism, once triggered, has no other path to follow but to proceed along this familiar route. I had a lay cousin, styled Daokuan, whose Dharma name was Yuanming. He resided at Jinshan for many years, having obtained the method of Jinshan. Later, he became the abbot of Yongshui Hermitage in Beiyi, yet in both Chan and doctrinal teachings, he paid no heed to this matter, as if it were mere overwatering—awakening only to one’s own nature without investigating further. I said to him: \"If there is leakage, then it resembles the lustful coupling of ordinary beings. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states that if one does not sever the lustful body, lustful mind, and lustful root, it is like steaming sand and stones in the hope of making rice: even after a hundred thousand kalpas, it will only become cooked sand. One will inevitably enter demonic paths, revolving through the three evil destinies, never to escape. How can Chan and doctrinal teachings ignore this?\" The Dao of the Tathāgata’s *wisdom-life* is transmitted from buddha to buddha, patriarch to patriarch. If one can apply it oneself, the three kinds of lustful affairs will be severed through a single refinement. Therein lies a profound principle.\n\nTo gather it within—\nto gather it through inhalation—\nif breath is not governed by intention, it has no master.\n\"Within\" refers to the cinnabar field.\n\"Subtle and continuous as if present\" means to keep the thought fixed upon it.\nHarmonizing and fusing, it becomes the womb-source of the true seed—\nthis is the true transmission of the correct Dao.\nThe method of gathering inward described above is here expounded as the work of moment-to-moment nurturing.\nOnce the *wisdom-life* has returned to its source, one must then constantly regulate the breath and guard the intention at every moment, as if tending a flame in the furnace. Intention and *qi* are both smelted, transforming into the true seed. This is the dual cultivation of nature and *wisdom-life*. With time, \"nothing\" gives birth to \"something.\" All else is but side doors, leading ultimately to no attainment.\n\nThe ancients spoke of \"fire transformation\"—\n\"fire\" is true intention.\nThey spoke of \"harmonization\"—\nthe union of nature and *wisdom-life*.\nThey spoke of \"facing the Dipper\"—\n\"facing\" is inward contemplation;\nthe \"Dipper\" is the cinnabar field.\nThey spoke of \"cross-legged sitting\"—\ncross-legged sitting means using true intention to sit upon the watery surface of the north within one’s body, entering extinction—this is the initial method for entering the first pass.\n\nIn ancient times, the Venerable Śāṇavāsa saw Ānanda sitting cross-legged upon the water’s surface in the midst of the current, entering extinction. Three times he sought instruction, and later Ānanda transmitted to him the treasury of the true Dharma eye, making him the third patriarch. This elucidates the application of this Dao. The myriad skillful metaphors all refer to nothing more than the two things: nature and *wisdom-life*. The work must reach its timely fruition. Yet this is not the achievement of a single day or night; it is the accumulation of months and years. It also depends on whether one is diligent or indolent, young or old.\n\n\"Timeliness\" does not refer to the seasons of heaven but to the moment when the \"thing\" is produced within one’s body. From the midst of nothingness, the \"thing\" arises. When the \"thing\" arises, the mind has something to know. If one sits in blank emptiness, one will miss it when it appears. At this moment, one must not allow it to proceed naturally but must reverse its course. The arising of the \"thing\" is originally a downward, natural flow, so one uses intention and breath to gather it. Bodhidharma called this \"gathering and taking.\" Proceeding outward is the \"leakage-exhausting penetration\"; reversing its course is \"gathering and taking.\" Once the \"thing\" has returned to its source—the cinnabar field—there arises the wondrous movement of the Dharma wheel. The posterior ascent and anterior descent are called the Dharma wheel. This initiates the ebb and flow of opening and closing—\"opening and closing\" refers to the inner and outer breath. When the outer breath is at its lowest, the inner breath rises; when the outer breath rises, the inner breath descends. Circulating between above and below—\"circulating\" means dynamic movement; \"above\" is the crown, and \"below\" is the abdomen. The Sixth Patriarch said, \"I have one thing that props up heaven and supports the earth\"—this is it. It stands at the heart of heaven.\n\nAt the heart of heaven is called the \"Central Yellow,\" residing at the very center of the heavens. It is also named the \"Celestial Stem\" or the \"Handle of the Dipper.\" In heaven, it is the heart of heaven; in man, it is true intention. If the Central Palace loses its true intention, it is like a minister losing his sovereign.\n\nWhenever turning the Dharma wheel, one must seat true intention at the Central Palace as the axle’s core, enabling the claws to revolve. It depends upon the Conception and Governor Vessels. When turning the Dharma wheel, intention and life-force must move in accord with the Conception and Governor Vessels. If intention moves while life-force does not, or life-force moves while intention does not, the elixir will not form. Return to the root and restore life—this is returning to one’s original ground. Hence, it is called the \"Four Phases and Six Phases.\" Gathering, sealing, ascending, descending, and bathing are all part of this process.\n\nWhen the count is complete and the substance is numinous, there exists the secret of gathering and passing through the gates. Having clarified the method of practice used earlier, with long and persistent cultivation, the inner cavities become full. In stillness, the celestial mechanism stirs, the entire body harmonizes in bliss, and the yang organ no longer rises—this is called \"the count complete, the substance numinous.\" Once the substance is numinous, one should gather and transport it past the three posterior gates, returning it to the Central Palace. The secret of this method is most wondrous and profound; though it should not be spoken of, I now speak of it.\n\nIf one gathers when it should not be gathered, the substance is too tender. If it arises but is not taken, it is like missing it face to face. This is due to not having received the true method—all because one has not received transmission from a teacher. To obtain the true method, one must humbly seek a teacher, protect and cherish them over time. Most who study the Dao in this world fail to receive the complete method because they already possess some knowledge or ability, belittle their teachers, and treat the Dharma lightly. If one can be humble and earnest, observe the rites of a disciple, and with sincere devotion protect and assist the teacher in attaining the Dao, how could one not receive the complete Way?\n\nCultivate virtue and offer resources. Virtue is the essence and function of the Dao. If one seeks the teacher’s Way but does not cultivate virtue, how can one encounter it? Virtue and the Dao are like a bird’s wings—without one, the other is useless. \"Resources\" refers to wealth. As the ancients said, \"Dharma and wealth are both offerings; through them, both self and others attain enlightenment.\" If one claims to cultivate the Dao yet does not give even a penny, seeking fame and reputation while using Buddhism as a disguise, even if a great enlightened master were present, they would turn away in disdain. Only then can one attain the great Dao.\n\nThose in the world who study Buddhism claim that sitting alone brings attainment—how absurd! Liu Zhilüe attained realization while sitting, but this was due to his powerful connections, which he shared with the Sixth Patriarch. This is the mechanism of the furnace’s firing. The furnace is the cinnabar field. It also relies on the still contemplation of intention, and the substance arises. Still contemplation of intention means, as the Tathāgata said, \"If one does not know where the mind and eyes abide, one cannot subdue worldly afflictions.\" Whether the substance emerges from the furnace or not depends entirely on the power of intention. Moreover, the \"substance\" is but a metaphor for primordial qi. The Tathāgata called it \"fire arising in the furnace\"—this is the teaching of Pimo Guangru Tathāgata. \"Fire\" is warmth, and \"arising\" is movement—this is the sign of the elixir’s formation. At this time, the image of the Maṇi appears.\n\nThe warmth mentioned above is the inner vision, while the image is the outer vision. Without fear or alarm—if one suddenly sees this vision without having received true transmission, mistaking it for something external and becoming startled, the mind will stir and the spirit scatter. The elixir will disperse, and the hope of attaining the Dao will be distant indeed. Move in unison: when life-force moves, intention moves; when life-force halts, intention halts—thus they proceed together. Be vigilant against the dangers of deviant paths. The deviant paths were explained in the collected sayings above.\n\nCross the ford of the Ganges. The Ganges refers to the marrow path within the spine, where there are places of obstruction above and below. True intention must ferry one across this point—hence, it is called the ford. Ascend from the Caoxi Stream to Vulture Peak. The Caoxi Stream is the marrow path mentioned above; Vulture Peak lies at the back of the head. Reach Mount Sumeru and descend the Tower of Nine Stories. Mount Sumeru is the crown of the head.\n\nThe Tower of Nine Stories is the qi-throat. The qi-throat has twelve segments—hence, it is called the Tower of Nine Stories. Journey to the Flower Realm of the Southern Florescence. Now, this journey signifies the advent of the wisdom-life. In the Lotus Sutra assembly of old, the dragon maiden offered a pearl, journeyed to the southern realm, transformed from female to male, and attained the Buddha’s rank—this is the analogy. The south refers to the heart’s aperture. The heart delights in movement and dislikes stillness; it favors the new and rejects the old. Moment by moment it shifts, entering and exiting without cease, its abode unknown. From beginningless time until now, it has ceaselessly traversed the four modes of birth and six paths of existence—so it is said, \"When a person dies, the heart remains unknowing.\" Now, by good fortune, the wisdom-life arrives to subdue it, transmuting the conditioned nature into true nature, refining the consciousness-spirit into the primordial spirit—like lead restraining mercury, so mercury is stilled, its errant and playful nature extinguished. Without this wisdom-life entering the heart’s aperture, the heart cannot stabilize itself. Even with cultivation, it remains but the acquired consciousness-nature, not the prenatal nature. The prenatal nature, at the moment of □ (a \"force\" character within the mouth) descending into the earth, falls into the mandate—hence, it is called \"what Heaven mandates is called nature.\" Those who study the Buddha-dharma must awaken to the distinction between prenatal and postnatal nature. Without self-awakening, they will never achieve fruition.\n\nSit and ascend the Buddha’s Radiant Jeweled Palace. The Jeweled Palace is the aperture below the heart, the place where the Dao-embryo is nurtured and prolonged stability is attained. Suddenly, it becomes billowing like valley clouds, misty like spring rain, swirling and gathering in the Central Palace—this is called \"forming the Dao-embryo.\" When the śarīra ascends to the Central Palace, the entire body surges like rising clouds, scatters like falling rain, and the hundred vessels harmonize, flowing freely through the four limbs. Swiftly, turn the heart and eyes: leftward nine turns, then rightward to stabilize; rightward six turns, then leftward to stabilize. Nature and life spiral and gather in the Central Palace, forming the Dao-embryo. This is the samādhi of peace and bliss. At this stage, nothing is lost or diminished—once attained, it is eternally realized.\n\nHow could one not be at peace and bliss? Naturally, the samādhi of quiescence is attained. Nurture it without forcing or forgetting, without sinking into stillness or clinging to illumination. When the Dao-embryo first forms, the postnatal breath appears as if existent yet does not adhere to existence—hence \"do not forget.\" Once the Dao-embryo is formed, the mind abides within it, motionless and silent; yet one must not succumb to dullness but remain ever awake and aware—hence \"do not cling to illumination.\"\n\nIn the stillness of samādhi, suddenly a vast moonwheel hangs in the void, rising from the cinnabar field to the space before the eyes. Retain it—with true intent, hold it there. A red sunwheel ascends within the moon, and sun and moon merge. Gather and conceal them, using the method to withdraw them into the central storehouse.\n\nIn the depth of quiescence, one abides in extinction, where not a single thought arises. The realm of being and non-being returns to primordial undifferentiation; true nature is emptiness and void. Thus is the state of non-doing. Utter vacuity is reached to its utmost.\n\nYet the great Dao is inexhaustible: extreme stillness gives rise to movement. A single entity ascends to unite with the Dao-embryo. For all things, when pushed to their limit, return to their origin—and the great Dao is no different. From extreme stillness arises the impulse of movement: a speck of pure yang, rising from the *yongquan* to the Central Palace, intimately embracing and merging with the Dao-embryo, becoming one with it. Thus the Dharma-wheel turns once more.\n\nWhen this essence returns to the Dao-embryo, it descends naturally, ascending from the *weilü* to the crown, then settling in the Central Palace—this is the supreme treasure that nurtures the embryo’s source. Stillness deepens into stillness, extinction into extinction. The breath ceases at the nostrils, the six pulses vanish from the hands—this is the great samādhi. The embryo is complete, and qi is full; celestial flowers scatter in profusion. Where celestial flowers descend, the embryo is full; where they do not, the embryo is incomplete.\n\nAt this stage, the Buddha-child’s concentration must shift and transcend the Three Realms. Upon witnessing this sign, one should immediately shift awareness and emerge from samādhi. The Three Realms refer to the lower cinnabar field, the Central Palace, and the crown gate—this is the manifestation of the Tathāgata. As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: \"The World-Honored One, from the white curl between his brows, emits a great radiance called the Tathāgata’s manifestation.\"\n\nWhen first emerging from samādhi, guard against incursions by external demons. Upon initial emergence, should buddhas or bodhisattvas appear and speak, do not engage in conversation—maintain right mindfulness, moving in and out without wandering far.\n\nA wheel of golden light, inherently one’s own numinous essence, is to be reclaimed as the wondrous elixir for transforming form. Upon emerging from samādhi, do not cling to any phenomena; only await the appearance of a golden lightwheel in the void. Draw the Dharma-body near the light, gather the light with the Dharma, and absorb it into the Dharma-body. Then the Dharma-body enters the mortal body, and over time, like nourishing milk, the mortal body is instantly transformed into qi. Should one fail to obtain this golden light, the mortal body cannot be transmuted into qi—hence the teaching of preserving the body, which depends on the power of virtue.\n\nThis is the celestial mechanism guarded for ages, now revealed. Gather and nurture it, and it will be passed down through generations. When first emerging, one remains a single body; with prolonged samādhi, a hundred thousand billion transformation bodies arise.\n\nWhen vows are fulfilled and practice complete, withdraw into deep valleys, leaving no trace, returning to the void to merge with the wondrous Dao. When merit is full, retreat into remote mountain caves, where no one comes or goes. Sit in perfect stillness, refining form into qi, spirit returning to the void—both form and spirit become empty. This is the Tathāgata’s final affair.\n\nI urge fellow practitioners: do not mistake superficial Chan or external samādhis for the true Way, for they are not the true Way.\n\n**On the Chan Mechanism, Chapter Twelve**\nHuayang says: The Buddha-Dao, nature and life, are likened to dragon and tiger; dragon and tiger to movement and stillness; movement and stillness to the Chan mechanism—why so many metaphors? From birth, humans possess nothing but nature and life; what else could there be? To attain the Dao, one must first preserve nature and life. The repository of nature and life is also called dragon and tiger. The movements and stillness of dragon and tiger are also called activity and quiescence. Activity is the mechanism; quiescence is Chan. A thousand names and ten thousand metaphors all refer to nothing but nature and life. Apart from these two, everything else is but a deceptive lure to delude the foolish.\n\nThe ancient buddhas said: Without understanding nature and life, the great Dao cannot be accomplished. Through countless doors and gates, expending every effort, yet not knowing nature and life—or cultivating only nature or only life—nothing will be achieved. All buddhas and patriarchs have refined and cultivated nothing but nature and life. Since ancient times, no one has attained the fruit of realization without cultivating nature and life.\n\nYet if it is called nature and life, why also speak of the Chan mechanism? A tranquil heart is Chan; the stirring of the kidneys is the mechanism. From birth, humans receive nature and life as a single mass. When conceived, the qi of father and mother unite into one qi, and a speck of numinous light—nature—resides within. The ancients’ saying that the three families harmonize to form the body is no falsehood.\n\nAt birth, it divides into two. With the first cry—*li!*—upon entering the world, nature separates into the heart, life into the kidneys. These two, though only eight inches and four fen apart, never reunite in old age. When vitality peaks at the appointed time—around fifteen or sixteen years of age—the qi of the cinnabar field stirs naturally. The primordial treasure of wisdom-life, the primordial qi received from before heaven, undergoes transformation, and the mechanism of opening the pass and turning outward arises.\n\nFor the primordial qi concealed within the cinnabar field, when postnatal qi is sufficient, the prenatal qi stirs of itself. If this stirring is left unrefined, the Yang Pass opens outward, and it transforms into the leak-prone essence of the postnatal realm. To prevent its outward flow, seize this moment—this *mechanism*—where within appears a vision, and without, the outer kidneys stir. Turn the light inward, reflect it back, and concentrate the mind into the Northern Sea, so that the primordial treasure follows the mind’s return to the Northern Sea. As Master Jiwu said: \"Concentrate the spirit and draw it into this chamber, and qi will follow the spirit, naturally returning to this aperture.\" The World-Honored One also said: \"Where the mind and eyes reside.\" Thus it is called harmonizing and congealing. To unite the heart with the kidneys is called *congealing*. The reason it is said to have transformations of sequence and reversal is this: following the sequence, primordial essence becomes leak-prone; reversing it, primordial qi becomes the substance. Hence it is called *mechanism*. *Mechanism* means movement. Without calling it *mechanism*, people would not recognize the stirring of the treasure of wisdom-life. Now, life is primordial qi. Though its stirring does not leak, it still dissipates outward, and when exhausted—alas! The cultivator does not allow it to dissipate outward but gathers and stores it within, thereby accomplishing the Dao. All living beings are of this qi. Thus it is called the supreme treasure. To sit rigidly in dull emptiness—as today’s Chan practitioners, ignorant of wisdom-life, mistake dead sitting with gathered mind for the Dao—is mistaken. They lose the true mechanism of harmonizing nature and life. Not knowing the congealing of nature and life, they grind bricks to make mirrors—what benefit is there? Falling into withered stillness, with what will they produce the true seed? Without knowing the method of harmonizing and congealing, no vision of the true seed’s birth will appear. When the mechanism ceases, silent illumination is perfectly merged—this is called *Chan*. When the mechanism ceases, life does not stir, Yang does not rise—hence it is called the ceasing of the mechanism. Once the mechanism has ceased, turn the light inward in tranquil reflection, without affairs or action—this is called *Chan*. When the time arrives and it stirs suddenly, it is again called *mechanism*. Now, *time* does not mean the time of heaven and earth, but the time when the true seed is born. If one knows the method used previously, there will naturally come a time when the true seed is born. Swiftly gather and retrieve it, returning it to the original palace. If not retrieved, the opportunity is lost.\n\nPerfection and penetration are called \"stealthy attainment\"—*stealing* means *taking*. It arises from the ebb and flow of opening and closing. Opening and closing are the inner and outer breath; ebb and flow are the mechanism of the primordial pass. Moving the wheel of the primordial mechanism—this is the path by which the true seed courses through the *Ren* and *Du* meridians. Breath hastens its passage, hence it is called the wheel of the primordial mechanism. The true seed, the numinous treasure, should return to its root and be deeply concealed, stored in the lower *dantian*. The ancients called this *returning to the origin and restoring life*. Its circulation returns again to the original cavern of life. Yet having obtained this seed, it is through the mechanism of the wheel that one attains mastery—this is called *śarīra*. *Śarīra* is the refinement of life through the cultivation of nature, hence it is called *śarīra*. Abandon the effortful work, discard the method of wind-driven circulation. Employ the effortless method, turning the light inward in reflection. In silent stillness, illuminate it—this is again called *Chan*. This is the work of gathering *śarīra*, requiring seven days of illumination. This is called *the locus of heart and eye*—*locus* means the heart and eye rest upon the place of *śarīra*. Then the *maṇi* pearl forms, coalescing into one. Its shape is like cinnabar, its light like snow. Within, it is red; when it radiates, it is white. Molten as if smelted, sweet as honey. The *dantian* melts with warmth, the mouth as if filled with honey. Vivid and fluid, it flows forth—this is again called *mechanism*. *Forth* means issuing from the furnace. Without alarm or doubt, settle the mind in stillness. Await its movement and gather it, observing its motion to act in unison—this is truly the wondrous method and skillful means of gathering. Apart from this, there is no other way. It is said that the soft can overcome the hard. Seize this moment of movement—*movement* refers to the pearl’s motion. Gently it pierces through the threefold iron pass. *Gently* means neither ahead nor behind; ahead is called guiding and deviant practices, behind is called visualization and heterodox paths. Thus, it must proceed in mutual dependence. *Threefold* refers to the spine’s ascent, with apertures on either side through which it rises straight upward. This is called *transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood*. Refining *śarīra* below the navel, once formed, it must transcend and depart the illusory realm—if it does not transcend, there will ultimately be affliction. The *maṇi* treasure-pearl having returned to the center—below the heart, above the kidneys—gently guard and steadily illuminate it, this is again called *Chan*. Continuously nurture it. Within *Chan* concentration, there is the bliss of effortless harmony—a mass of supreme harmony’s heavenly principle, as if intoxicated or suffused with fragrance. The Buddha called this the *samādhi* within *Chan* concentration. Yet within effortlessness, there suddenly arises effort—this is again called *mechanism*. A drop of sweet dew in the vast emptiness. Now, if it is called effortless, why again speak of *mechanism*? If not for *mechanism*, one would not know of this wondrous thing, remaining alone within the womb, unaware of the Dao, for heaven and humanity have a mutually assisting mechanism. Following this wondrous thing of mechanism, gather and attach it to the embryo, guiding it with intention back to the central palace. In tranquil illumination, prolong its concentration—this is again called *Chan*. As before, nurture it. This is called *birth and extinction extinguished*. The two *qi* are eternally settled. Within the stillness of concentration, a thing suddenly transcends and emerges—this is again called *mechanism*. It comes from the *dantian*, possessing radiance but no form, suspended in the vast emptiness. Wait patiently for it—this is again called *Chan mechanism*. After two or three breaths, it emerges again—this is again called *mechanism*. It too comes from the *dantian*, possessing radiance but no form, merging with the previous thing. Gather and conceal it. Employ the secret heavenly mechanism, withdrawing the hand into the womb. In tranquil illumination, gently and silently guard it—this is again called *Chan*. Without affairs in effortlessness, constantly still yet constantly aware. Within tranquil illumination and gentle silence, two things emerge from the *yongquan* points—this is again called *mechanism*. Two paths of pure Yang things ascend straight from the *yongquan* to the crown, then descend to the central palace. Gather and settle them in stillness—this is again called *Chan*. The nose ceases exhalation, the six pulses are all at peace. This is called *quiescent extinction*, leaving no trace of entry or exit. When the concentration of quiescent extinction endures, flurries of white snow fill the void—this is again called *mechanism*. At this time, discern the mechanism of emerging from concentration. This is the true scene. Do not allow delay or obstruction—swiftly emerge from it.\n\nShould one remain stagnant within the womb-like state, lacking the transformations of spiritual penetrations, one is but another foolish man. One must then emerge from it—ascending through the crown. This is called transcending the Three Realms; remain tranquil and await it. Departing the ordinary body by one or two feet, one awaits it—this is again called *Chan*. A sheet of golden light hangs suspended in the void—this is again called *mechanism*. Gather and draw it in, settle into stillness upon stillness—this is again called *Chan*. With prolonged and enduring stillness, form and spirit both transform, and the discourse on *Chan* and *mechanism* thus concludes. From ancient times to the present, the *mechanism* of *Chan* has, until now, been fully revealed.\n\nI wish for those who study the Buddha’s Way to avoid straying into heterodox teachers and external paths, mistaking mere verbal *Chan-mechanism* for the true *mechanism*—for that is no *Chan-mechanism* at all.\n\n**Miscellaneous Teachings, Chapter Thirteen**\nMaster Huayang said: Those who accomplish the Great Dao do so invariably through the accumulation of past affinities. The Great Dao is the dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*, the method of subduing the Dragon and Tiger. To cultivate *xing* alone in desiccated solitude is not the Great Dao.\n\nPast affinities are the merits accumulated over countless kalpas, by which one is fortunate in this life to encounter dual cultivation. For example, Zhu Tu was a virgin youth, secluded in a lofty chamber within a wealthy household, unable to seek the Dao. By chance, he encountered one who conveyed the subtle message, received my guidance, and attained the fruition of the Dao—such was his prior cause.\n\nDuring the Jin dynasty, an ancestral master left this record: *\"In the year exceeding one thousand four hundred, the virgin youth Zhu Tu will sweep the path in welcome.\"* Was this not the predetermined result of past cultivation? One must then swiftly emerge from concentration, lest retrogressive thoughts arise.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"In that household, there is only him alone—how can he fail to bear a son to continue the lineage?\"*\nThe reply: *\"The Most High, the Tathāgata, and Kūṭāgārama all had sons.\"*\nAnother asked: *\"If the Dao is already accomplished, would bearing a child not leak and dissipate it?\"*\nThe reply: *\"Superior immortals and buddhas unite through spirit or *qi*; ordinary men cannot. To beget a child, they must unite in form, hence the leakage that injures their original essence. When the Tathāgata once departed for the mountains, his consort said: *'If you go, what shall I rely on later?'* The Tathāgata turned and pointed, saying: *'Later, you will bear a son.'* And indeed, she later gave birth to a son. Kūṭāgārama, the nineteenth patriarch of the Western Heaven, was invited by the Chinese emperor to expound the Dharma in this land. Afterward, he said to the king: *'This humble monk wishes to bear a son.'* The king then granted him palace women. At that time, all the monks were displeased.\"*\n\nRāma, perceiving their sentiment, transformed and presented the king with needles to offer the assembly of monks. None dared partake, but Rāma alone consumed a bowlful. At that moment, he expounded the Dharma, saying: *\"He who eats the needle shall wed a wife; he who cannot eat the needle shall not wed a wife.\"* The following day, the needles emerged from every pore of his body, and later, he indeed bore a son. This is the dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*, the transformation of spiritual penetration. Having already attained the Dao, why fear bearing a child?\n\nSome enter through seeing, others through hearing, yet at the moment of accomplishment, all are one. The preceding passage speaks of those with roots cultivated over many lifetimes; this speaks of those who begin cultivation in this life—whether by seeing others practice and following suit, or by hearing of others’ practice and taking it up themselves. When merit is perfected and conduct fulfilled, it is the same as those who came before. This is what is meant by *\"awakening, and the sentient being becomes a buddha; deluded, and the buddha is but a sentient being.\"*\n\nMoreover, it depends on the power of a discerning and resolute mind. All who study the Dao must possess a spark of spiritual awakening; one cannot rely solely on the words of others but must trust in one’s own insight. Do not be misled by heterodox paths or enamored of minor practices. The steadfast, upon seeing heterodox paths or minor practices, will naturally remain unconfused and unmoved.\n\nHumbly empty the self and reverently seek out lofty persons of resolve; diligently seek out teachers. Do not cling to sectarian divisions—all Three Teachings have hidden masters. When you encounter one, immediately seek the Dao; do not fixate on superficial traces. Search through the ancient sayings, seek a teacher to awaken the Dao, and use this to verify truth and falsehood. In the transmission of teachings, one must carefully examine each step to see whether the method aligns or not. Before receiving the oral instructions, one should first broadly study the scriptures of the Three Teachings, searching for the essential truths. When meeting a teacher, observe whether their teaching accords with the dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*. If the sequence is inverted, it is not the true Dao, and even if practiced, it will yield no benefit. Only if the instructions are genuine may one proceed and succeed.\n\nHow can one recognize genuine instructions? The Dao, when first undertaken, must be dual cultivation. With each step taken, there will be corresponding verification. Do not be swayed by old habits—old habits are the actions and tendencies of the past; today, they do not arise or manifest, for the mind is refined through effort. Do not be assailed by demonic obstructions. Those who study the Dao will encounter a measure of demonic obstruction for every measure of effort—whether inner or outer demons. A single true thought, concealed within *ming*, remains still and unmoving, for the mind’s refinement is complete. Doubt vanishes at once, and the true mind abides.\n\nHaving received the true oral instructions from a genuine teacher, press forward with courage and vigor, maintaining the true thought in every moment as the master of the Dao. Past, present, and future become undifferentiated—no thought of the future, no attachment to the past, no delight in the present. The three minds are forgotten, and the celestial principle is whole. Perceiving things, the inner self awakens and does not stray—just as the Sixth Patriarch said, *\"Seeing things, the mind swiftly arises.\"* Hearing sounds, the inner self remains steadfast and does not waver. As the *Heart Sutra* explains: *\"Let the world’s affairs churn in chaos; the master of the hall remains at peace all day.\"*\n\nBright as the sun at midday, the twelve hours are illuminated by an unwavering spark of spiritual light. Silent and luminous, the reflection returns in stillness—within the tranquility of concentration, the light turns back to illuminate the northern sea. The eight winds cannot shake it—eye, ear, nose, tongue, and mind remain unmoved, hence the \"eight winds.\" Then the great Dao may be hoped for. Cultivating the mind in this way, then undertaking the practice, one will see effects, and the Dao will surely be attainable. If the mind is not refined, the practice will yield no effects, and the Dao will not be achieved.\n\nThe supreme Dao does not proceed in isolation; it requires companions to uphold and protect it. If strength is weak and *qi* feeble, nothing will be accomplished. Strength here refers to wealth. Without resources, even with the method, merit is difficult to perfect. The Sixth Patriarch relied on the offerings of Chan Master Shenhui; the twenty-seventh patriarch received the king’s wealth through incense. The two kinds of giving are equal, both aiding in the completion of the Dao.\n\nYet to amass gold beyond measure, to pile wealth like mountains, and still not believe in the path to buddhahood—choosing instead to remain a ghost—how is this worthy? One must rely on those of virtue to return together to awakening. Virtue is most difficult to attain; one must possess the heart-mind of the buddhas and patriarchs to be truly virtuous in the Dao. When the Sixth Patriarch was nearing Shaozhou, he encountered Liu Zhilüe and formed a friendship with him. This was a shared awakening, the virtue of the Dao.\n\nTo discern the truth or falsehood of companions and protectors, one must observe their dispositions over time. A person’s goodness or evil will naturally reveal itself with the passage of days. Some are driven by a desire for superiority—pleased when praised, displeased when criticized—such people are unfit to study the Dao. Others pursue merit through contrived deeds—reciting scriptures, bowing to buddhas, building bridges, repairing roads, renovating temples, or receiving precepts—all merely seeking worldly blessings, irrelevant to the Dao. As the Sixth Patriarch said, *\"Even with blessings, karmic obstacles remain\"*—how can one seek such things?\n\nSome cling to their own abilities, believing themselves capable without resolve. Others claim buddhas and patriarchs are born enlightened, that ordinary beings cannot receive the true transmission. Little do they know that the great Dao is within everyone’s reach. With such people, do not reveal the mechanism. When encountering these four types, not a word should be spoken.\n\nSome value wealth over righteousness—those who prize wealth lack benevolence and cannot bear the Dao. Some begin with enthusiasm but do not persevere—sweet at first, bitter in the end. Some speak kindly but harbor malice—cultivating a reputation for show. Some are obsequious and deceptive—small-minded people who feign humility to advance. Some come from families without virtue—if ancestors lacked virtue, even if descendants cultivate, Heaven will not bestow the Dao upon them.\n\nBehold this profound and recondite treasury of truth. When encountering these five types of people, feign ignorance and folly. If one receives the true transmission from a man of resolve, they will naturally investigate the ultimate source. They will constantly awaken to their nature and life. Having repeatedly sought the esoteric teachings of buddhas and patriarchs—this esoterica being none other than nature and life—by searching within their own nature and life, it is evident they have received the Dao.\n\nBorn with loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, their innate celestial nature reveals roots of cultivation from past kalpas. Compassionate and charitable toward all beings, they broadly extend a heart of benevolent virtue. Upholding the Five Precepts in their entirety, revering the teacher and honoring the Dharma, they vow deeply—such are called companions of the Dao and protectors of the Dharma. Only those who comprehend such people may become fellow cultivators on the path.\n\nThereafter, the esoteric teachings of the Tathāgata may be revealed, and the primordial mechanism of the patriarchs disclosed. Only then is the great Dao transmitted. This is what is meant by \"the giver and the receiver together accomplish the true fellowship.\" The giver is the teacher; the receiver, the disciple. Only when the disciple protects the teacher’s completion of the Dao may the Dao be transmitted.\n\nIt is also said: \"Bestowing both wealth and Dharma, together they ascend the other shore.\" They offer me wealth to aid my affairs, and I offer them the Dharma to perfect their Dao. Thus the Tathāgata declared: \"The two offerings of wealth and Dharma are equal, without distinction.\"\n\nAt the time of undertaking the great work—this great work being the ten-month labor of passing the barrier...\n\nSelect a tranquil site among renowned mountains. A \"tranquil site\" is one far from human traffic and not near burial mounds, for the yin qi of graves brings harm. The mountain should be a place where ancient masters attained the Dao, for there no external demons arise, and only true spirits offer protection. The dwelling should not be lofty or grand—grandeur invites trouble—while walls must be sturdy and thick to keep out noxious creatures. Light and shadow should be balanced: too much light harms the *po*, too much darkness harms the *hun*. Food must be pure and clean, consisting solely of plain rice and vegetables. Avoid all fragrant spices and the five pungent roots, for fragrance disperses qi, and the five pungents stir lustful essence.\n\nPrepare all necessary ritual implements. Upon entering the chamber, place a catty of realgar beneath the bed to ward off malevolent qi. Hang an ancient mirror: when demons approach, their true forms appear within it. Keep a peachwood sword to repel external demons. The seat must be soft and thick, so the mind remains untroubled.\n\nWhen entering the chamber, master and disciple must swear to unite in purpose. Only with single-minded resolve may they dare to begin. If the slightest insincerity arises upon entry, how can the practitioner avoid harm?\n\nOnce the great work is accomplished and the Dao perfected, one should wander the world in playful freedom, guiding the lost. Having emerged from seclusion, one expounds the wondrous Dharma, leading later disciples—just as the Sixth Patriarch, upon attaining the Way, encountered the wind and [obscured character] before emerging to teach and liberate others. Those in the groves who have not yet attained the Dao yet preach first are deluded and false.\n\nThe twin methods of boundless compassion and the marvelous medicine that ferries beings to the other shore—this unity of self and other is the vow of ancient buddhas and sages.\n\n**Resolving Doubts, Fourteenth [Section]**\n*Six Questions Clearly Answered*\n\n**Six Questions Clearly Answered**\n\n**First Question:** Why does one not attain the Dao despite worshipping the Buddha?\n**Answer:** The Buddha resides in the vast emptiness—what need is there to worship? The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: *\"If one sees me in form, or seeks me in sound, such a person walks the wrong path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"*\n\n**Further Question:** Then is worship of no use?\n**Answer:** Worship is merely an expression of sincerity; it has no bearing on the Dao.\n\n**Second Question:** Why does one not attain the Dao despite reciting sūtras?\n**Answer:** Sūtras are the Buddha’s compositions. If one recites them for the Buddha to hear, why would he need to listen? If one recites them for oneself to hear, there is no need to do so in such a manner. The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: *\"If one seeks me in sound, such a person walks the wrong path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"* The Buddha is but a name among Westerners, just as Confucius is a surname among the Chinese. What offense has the Buddha committed that you must recite his name? It is like an examination candidate hoping to place first by chanting the sage’s surname—would that suffice? The Sixth Patriarch said: *\"Easterners commit sins and recite the Buddha’s name to be reborn in the West; if Westerners commit sins and recite the Buddha’s name, where then shall they be reborn?\"* What benefit does recitation bring to the Dao?\n\n**Third Question:** Why does one not attain the Dao despite receiving the precepts?\n**Answer:** The precepts are prohibitions. After attaining the Dao, the Tathāgata, seeing his followers were many, had Mañjuśrī request that he establish these precepts as a means to restrain the lower-minded and prevent disorder. The Sixth Patriarch said: *\"With a peaceful mind, what need is there to uphold precepts?\"* The great Dao resides within one’s nature and life, while these precepts lie on the surface—skin and hair. The two are not in harmony, so no attainment is possible.\n\n**Fourth Question:** The *Seven-Day Retreat* is now regarded in the Buddhist teachings as the supreme method, yet no one attains the Dao through it. Instead, practitioners often cough up blood—why is this?\nSince the Tathāgata’s dispensation, neither the twenty-eight patriarchs of the Western Heavens nor the six generations of the Eastern Land ever practiced this method. It was fraudulently devised by a disciple of the monk Gaofeng, ensnaring later generations. Gaofeng was a scholar of texts, not a follower of the Tathāgata’s Dao. Moreover, what is practiced is merely a side method of breath restraint. Those who cough up blood do so because kneeling for incense and suppressing breath harms the viscera, while sitting through incense and meals injures the spine. Even if Lü and Bian Que were present, they could not save them. In time, a perfected one will arise to abolish this method and rescue countless lives.\n\n**Fifth Question:** Some who practice the *Seven-Day Retreat* claim to have suddenly awakened to their Buddha-nature, yet they cough up blood and still teach others to practice it. Have they truly awakened to Buddha-nature?\n**Answer:** *Hua Yang* laughs heartily: *\"Those who have attained the Dao enjoy unimpeded circulation through all channels, a single mass of harmonious yang qi, with no obstruction from yin qi. Those who cough up blood suffer from disharmony between yin and yang, excess fire, and blocked yin qi. Their lives are in peril—how could they have awakened to Buddha-nature? The truth is self-evident without need for debate.\"*\n\n**Sixth Question:** The Sixth Patriarch, upon hearing the sūtra, suddenly awakened to *\"no abiding, yet giving rise to the mind.\"* Why then did he seek the Fifth Patriarch?\n**Answer:** What the Sixth Patriarch awakened to was the Dao of nature. Knowing he possessed the Dao of wisdom-life, he traveled thousands of miles to seek the master’s grace and receive its transmission. For wisdom-life must be transmitted by a teacher; empty awakening alone cannot attain it.\n\n**Six Questions from Scholar Li Sibai of Jieyi, whose courtesy name is Yu, and Daoist name is Jade Jade**\n\n**First Question:** Formerly, this disciple held no faith in Buddhism or Daoism. Having heard Master Zhu’s words that the teachings of Buddhism and Daoism are empty and insubstantial, I rejected them entirely. Later, a friend sent me one of the Master’s books. Initially, I had no desire to read it, but upon forcing myself to do so, I discovered true and substantial practice within. My faith became unwavering. After half a month of cultivation, I was fortunate to witness the manifestation of the true seed, feeling the eight channels within my body open all at once. Long-standing illnesses vanished in a single night, and now I form śarīra—what great fortune! This disciple has heard that today’s monastics, upon opening their mouths, claim to have awakened to their nature without need for cultivation, asserting that cultivation, once accomplished, will decay. Are these words true?\n**Answer:** Such claims are merely schemes for clothing and food. Fearing others might say they lack the Dao and thus lose their patrons, they employ deceptive tactics—where is there any truth in it? If cultivation were unnecessary, why did the World-Honored One spend six years on Snow Mountain? Why did Bodhidharma sit nine years at Shaolin? Why did the Sixth Patriarch seclude himself for fifteen years? All have their evidence. Those who speak of sudden awakening are but deceiving the world! When their breath ceases, they will be gone!\n\n**Second Question:** Is the cultivation of the Dao accomplished through one method or two?\n**Answer:** The myriad buddhas all follow a single method. Before obtaining wisdom-life, there are distinctions of schools and lineages; once wisdom-life is attained, all return to one. As the World-Honored One said: *\"Excluding duality, it is not the true.\"*\n\n**Third Question:** Are the Dharma transmissions in today’s Chan schools genuine? Furthermore, when a monastic becomes an abbot, they no longer need to seek others but become a great monk, ascend the Buddha’s seat, and preach the Dharma on his behalf. What Dharma is this?\n**Answer:** From the Western Heavens to the Eastern Land, from Bodhidharma to the Sixth Patriarch, transmission was passed mouth-to-ear, mind-to-mind. The Fifth Patriarch said: *\"Masters secretly transmit the original sound.\"* Now, the true transmission is lost, replaced by written records bearing the names of certain monks as Dharma-heirs. It is like actors claiming to be Emperor Gaozu or King Xiang Yu, or cowherds singing folk songs—fooling the ignorant and simple-minded. The wise see through it and can only laugh.\n\n**Fourth Question:** Is *kanhua* Chan—\"observing the keyword\"—the true Dao?\n\n**Answer:** This is but a side door of the Buddhist teaching. Thus, \"observing the keyword\" in Chan is merely a contest of one’s own superiority. As for the true Dao of the Buddhist teaching, one must first cultivate both aspects in tandem, putting genuine effort into practice—without inquiring after \"keywords.\"\n\n**Fifth Question:** When a seated meditator experiences leakage, what is the cause?\n**Answer:** By fifteen or sixteen, qi naturally overflows and leaks—yet without receiving the true transmission, one does not know how to apply the fire-cultivation. Without mastery of fire-cultivation, how can there be any principle of self-containment? To prevent leakage, one must constantly apply the fire to refine the point of leakage, transmuting essence into qi so that it ascends upward instead of leaking away.\n\n**Sixth Question:** Today’s Chan practitioners claim that leakage does not hinder Dao-cultivation. Is this correct?\n**Answer:** This is the foremost heresy. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"Those who do not sever the lustful body, lustful mind, and lustful root will inevitably fall into demonic paths, unable to escape for a hundred thousand kalpas.\" Moreover, one instance of leakage is no different in principle from one instance of coupling with an ordinary person. No Buddha or patriarch in the heavens has ever had a leaking body—so whence would their śarīra come? Such are the lowest of the Buddhist followers; they are not worth discussing.\n\n**Thirteen Questions of Monk Zhenyuan**\n**First Question:** Where does one begin with the true Dao?\n\n**Answer:** Where the mind and eyes rest—also called \"concentrated harmony\"—one must know there is a wondrous place of abiding. As the ancients said: \"Inward reflection and concentrated union reveal the destination—it lies precisely where life resides.\"\n\n**Second Question:** When does one begin?\n**Answer:** When the substance is present, then one begins. The patriarchs said: \"Precious is the natural substance, solitary and without companion.\" It is neither mind nor thought, but the substance concealed within the sea; when it stirs, awareness arises—this is the moment to begin.\n\n**Third Question:** The ancients spoke of \"subduing the dragon and taming the tiger.\" What are the dragon and tiger?\n**Answer:** The dragon is the numinous thought within the mind, while the tiger is the warm sign within the sea of qi. To subdue dragon and tiger, first let the dragon dwell in the tiger’s den, then let the tiger return to the dragon’s cave—thus is their natural subjugation achieved.\n\n**Fourth Question:** What is meant by \"the fierce tiger leaving the forest\"?\n**Answer:** It is the stirring of the yang substance.\n**Further Question:** How is it subdued?\n**Answer:** By driving it with the dragon and fanning it with the wind.\n\n**Fifth Question:** What is the true seed?\n**Answer:** When dragon and tiger are refined into one substance, and the mechanism stirs, it is called the true seed.\n\n**Sixth Question:** What is the *śarīra*?\n**Answer:** It is what the true seed produces through the refining method of the Dharma-wheel, such that the external kidneys no longer rise—hence the name *śarīra*.\n\n**Seventh Question:** What is the *maṇi*-pearl?\n**Answer:** It is what the *śarīra* produces through the method of moving past the three posterior barriers and returning to the central palace—hence the name *maṇi*-pearl. As the ancients said: \"Three before, three after\"—this is it.\n\n**Eighth Question:** What is the Dao-embryo?\n**Answer:** When the *maṇi*-pearl returns to the central palace and unites with intent, with intent dwelling within the pearl as iron is drawn to a magnet—this is called the Dao-embryo.\n\n**Ninth Question:** What are the six supernormal powers?\n**Answer:** First, the power of the exhaustion of outflows is perfected; then the five powers arise. If one cultivates only nature and ignores the wisdom-life, only the five powers are attained, and the exhaustion of outflows cannot be perfected. Lacking this one power, one cannot become a Buddha but remains a wandering spirit, transmigrating through kalpas.\n\n**Tenth Question:** What is \"emerging from samādhi\"?\n**Answer:** When the pearl within the Dao-embryo is refined into oneness and, upon completion, emerges from the crown of the head.\n\n**Eleventh Question:** What is the transformation body?\n**Answer:** It is the body transformed after emerging from samādhi.\n**Further Question:** What is the method of transformation?\n**Answer:** Like the movement of the ten fingers of a hand—whether one finger moves or all ten move, it is entirely a matter of intention.\n\n**Twelfth Question:** When secondary practices and the true Dao reach completion, what are the signs?\n**Answer:** Those who claim success in secondary practices do so with empty talk, without evidence or basis. When the true Dao produces *śarīra*, the external kidneys cease all movement. When the Dao-embryo is formed, the six pulses in the hands vanish, white hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow, and upon emerging from samādhi, a body appears outside the body—those who seek a teacher should examine these signs for themselves.\n\n**Thirteenth Question:** If one does not attain the true Dao, what becomes of them in the future?\n**Answer:** Plant melons and you get melons; plant beans and you get beans.\n\n**Question from the Abbot of Taiyi Haihui Monastery, Longjiang:** If one cultivates in stillness alone, without arising stray thoughts, can one avoid leakage and perfect the power of the exhaustion of outflows?\n**Answer:** Stillness cultivation only severs lustful body and lustful conduct, but not the lustful root. Since the root is not severed, the exhaustion of outflows cannot be perfected. To perfect the exhaustion of outflows, one must employ the work of fire and wind. The Tathāgata spoke of \"fire transformation\" and \"wind fanning\"—there is indeed a true transmission.\n\n**Abbot Shizang of the Yaoshi Cloister in Hongdu**\n\n**Question:** If one suddenly awakens to the state beyond ordinary and sacred, with a single thought perfectly fused like the vast sky, and after prolonged stillness, the lower body becomes harmoniously warm and moves, even reaching the external kidneys—why is this so?\n\n**Answer:** This is the wondrous subtlety of Chan mechanism. When first applying the method to cultivate the life of wisdom, one must use the Dharma to withdraw [the qi] back to its origin—this is what is called \"dual cultivation.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to *The Sutra of the Wisdom-Life***\n*by Liu Huayang of the Qing Dynasty*\n\nI, Huayang, am a native of Hongdu. From childhood, I was drawn to the Buddha. Entering a monastic sanctuary, I gained insight and ever after harbored thoughts of transcending the mundane, rejoicing at the sight of monks. One day, I heard an elder speak of how the Fifth Patriarch secretly transmitted the Dao to the Sixth Patriarch in the third watch of the night. Listening intently, I was overjoyed, as if awakening from a dream. Only then did I realize that those who cultivate the Dao must rely on a master’s transmission, and so I sought without cease.\n\nMy footsteps traversed the lands of Jing and Chu, yet I met no one. Later, I took tonsure at Shuanglian Temple by the Wan River, redoubling my inquiries. I studied under masters of the Three Teachings, yet none fully grasped the essence of the *wisdom-life*. Sighing to myself, I thought: *\"The human form is hard to attain—shall I fritter it away in vain?\"* Suddenly, a resolve arose: each night at the second watch, I prostrated myself in full devotion, vowing to Heaven that I would not rest until I found the Way.\n\nAfter half a year, I was fortunate to meet Master He Wu Chongxu, who transmitted to me the secret teachings. In an instant, I awakened, realizing that the Dao of *wisdom-life* is none other than the innate spiritual essence within me. Later, at Mount Lu, I encountered Master Huyun. Listening to his discourse, I knew him to be no ordinary man. With earnest devotion and humble entreaties, I entreated him, and he, in his boundless compassion, unveiled the profound and subtle mysteries—every inner and outer subtlety was made perfectly clear.\n\nAs I prepared to depart, my master exhorted me: *\"The dual cultivation of the Buddha’s teaching has now perished. You must continue its lifeblood to ferry those with karmic affinity.\"* I withdrew to the lands east of the Yangtze, where, with two or three fellow Daoists, I burned incense and delved deeply into practice. Witnessing Bichan’s arduous cultivation—how through jade-like true essence he had already formed *śarīra*—I silently aligned with my master’s transmission. Thus, I compiled this text, titling it *The Sutra of the Wisdom-Life*, illustrating it with diagrams to reveal the ancient Buddha’s secrets and disclose the primordial mechanism of the patriarchs. Truly, it is a raft and ladder for guiding later learners.\n\nI have observed that those who seek the Dao often venerate recorded sayings, yet among these, some are true and some are false. Those of lesser learning, unaware of the Tathāgata’s *wisdom-life* Dao, mistakenly enter the trap of formulaic Chan, remaining mired in ignorance and ultimately harmed by these very records. Having thoroughly studied the sutras and verified them against my masters’ transmissions, I affirm: the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, and the *Platform Sūtra* are true teachings. The recorded sayings of Chan masters and abbots, however, are false.\n\nThe path of cultivation demands truth to authenticate its true principles and to dispel delusion. When delusion prevails, demonic obstacles arise, and even the wise and sagacious find no entry. For a thousand years, the Dao of *wisdom-life* has been closely guarded, transmitted only in secret, rarely glimpsed. Now, in these humble words, I lay bare the transmission of the Buddha’s treasure, offering it in full. May those who study this *Sutra of the Wisdom-Life* feel as though they have received it directly from a master’s lips. With diligent effort and unwavering resolve, they need not seek aid elsewhere—the fruition of Buddhahood can be realized at once. This is the very aspiration that drove me to seek a master and awaken to the Dao.\n\nWritten in the summer of the *jiayin* year of the Qianlong reign, by Liu Huayang of Chuanlu, Hukou, at Zhongjie Hermitage in Wan City.\n\n**Diagram of the Exhaustion of the Water Clock (First)**\nThe subtlety of the Dao is nowhere more profound than in *nature* and *life*.",

      "translated_text": "The cultivation of *nature* and *life* is nothing so profound as returning to the One. The ancient sages and lofty worthies, in expounding the principle of uniting *nature* and *life*, often employed clever metaphors drawn from external things, yet never dared to state it plainly and directly. Thus, in the world, there have been none who practiced the dual cultivation of both. My continuation of these diagrams is not an act of reckless disclosure. Rather, it follows the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s teaching on the exhaustion of the water clock, reveals the wondrous purport of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, and gathers the scattered words of the various scriptures to return them to the correct diagram. Only then does one realize that the *wisdom-life* is found nowhere outside this *aperture*.\n\nMoreover, the purpose of this diagram is to enable those of like aspiration to understand this celestial mechanism of dual cultivation, lest they fall into heterodox paths. Only then will they know that the true seed is conceived here, the exhaustion of the water clock is accomplished here, the *śarīra* is refined here, and the great Dao is perfected here. This aperture is a cavern of emptiness and nothingness, formless and shadowless. When *qi* arises, it becomes an opening; when the mechanism ceases, it vanishes into obscurity—this is the abode where the true is concealed. The altar for cultivating the *wisdom-life* is called the Dragon Palace at the Ocean’s Bottom, the Realm of Snow Mountain, the Western Paradise, the Primordial Pass, the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Homeland of the Boundless. Though the names are many, they all refer to this single aperture. If cultivators do not understand this aperture, then through countless kalpas and myriad rebirths, the *wisdom-life* will remain nowhere to be found.\n\nHow vast is this aperture! Before one’s parents gave birth to this body, at the moment of conception, this aperture was the first to form, and *nature* and *life* truly resided within it. The two merged and became one, harmonious and flourishing, like a spark in a furnace—a single mass of primordial harmony and celestial principle. Thus it is said: “In the prenatal state, there are boundless transformations.” Thus it is said: “Before one’s parents were born, when *qi* was full and the embryo complete, the body moved and the sac burst—like a man slipping from a high mountain, with a resounding *kacha!*—and *nature* and *life* were divided into two.” From that moment onward, *nature* could no longer see *life*, nor *life* see *nature*. From youth to maturity, from maturity to old age, from old age to death.\n\nTherefore, the Tathāgata, in great compassion, revealed the method of cultivation to save beings, enabling them to re-enter the womb and recreate their *nature* and *life*. They guide their spirit and *qi* into this aperture, uniting the two into one to conceive the embryo—its principle is one and the same. Within the aperture resides the sovereign fire; at its gate lies the ministerial fire; throughout the body burns the common fire. When the sovereign fire arises, the ministerial fire responds; when the ministerial fire moves, the common fire follows. If the three fires proceed in harmony, a human is formed; if the three fires return in reverse, the Dao is attained. Thus, the aperture of the exhausted water clock is the origin from which both ordinary beings and sages arise. To cultivate anything other than this path is of no benefit. Yet among the thousand schools and myriad teachings, none know that within this aperture resides the sovereign of the *wisdom-life*. Seeking externally, they exhaust their minds in vain and achieve nothing.\n\n**Diagram of the Dharma-Wheel’s Six Phases (Second)**\nThe wondrous function of the Dao is none other than the Dharma-wheel. Its movement is unhindered, like a road; its speed varies, like a rule; its limits are precise, like a measure. This diagram is complete in its methods, and the true visage of the Western transmission is fully contained herein. Its profound practices—none surpass the breath; its ebb and flow—none surpass opening and closing; its path—none surpass true intention; its boundaries—none surpass the realm of action. Setting aside the self to follow others, this diagram fully reveals the celestial mechanism. Even the foolish and vulgar, if they obtain it, will attain success. Yet without virtue, even if one encounters the Dao, Heaven will not uphold it. Why? Virtue and the Dao are like a bird’s wings—lacking one, they are of no use. One must first perfect loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, righteousness, and the Five Precepts in their entirety before any hope may be held. The subtle and wondrous mysteries within are all contained in the *Sutra of the Wisdom-Life*. Comparing the two, nothing will fail to be grasped in its truth.\n\n**Diagram of the Ren and Du Meridians (Third)**\nThis diagram is one with the previous two. Why then is it drawn again? It is to prevent cultivators from remaining ignorant of the pathways of the Dharma-wheel within their own bodies. Thus, this diagram is provided to enlighten those of like aspiration. If one can unblock these two meridians, then all the meridians will be unblocked. The deer, when sleeping, inserts its nose into its anus to unblock the *Du* meridian; the crane and the tortoise unblock the *Ren* meridian. These three creatures all attain a lifespan of a thousand years—how much more so for humans! Cultivators who turn the Dharma-wheel to circulate the *wisdom-life*—how could they not attain longevity and fulfill their Daoist practice?\n\n**Diagram of the Dao-Embryo (Fourth)**\nThis diagram reveals the wondrous purport originally contained in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*. Common monks, not understanding the Dao-embryo, were merely unaware due to the absence of such diagrams in the past. Now, through this explication, cultivators will know that the Tathāgata possessed the true practice of the Dao-embryo. The embryo is not some separate thing with form and appearance; it is truly one’s spirit and *qi*. First, the spirit enters the *qi*; then the *qi* comes to envelop the spirit. Spirit and *qi* intertwine, and intention becomes utterly still—this is what is called the embryo. Only when *qi* congeals does the spirit become numinous. Thus, the scripture says: “Personally attend to the responsive awakening, and nurture the two *qi*.” Thus it says: “Day by day, it grows; when *qi* is full and the embryo complete, it emerges from the crown—this is what is called forming and emerging from the embryo, becoming the true child of the Buddha.”\n\n**Diagram of Emerging from the Embryo (Fifth)**\nThe *Śūraṅgama Dhāraṇī* states: “At that time, the World-Honored One emitted a hundred-jeweled light from his flesh-topknot. From within the light emerged a thousand-petaled jeweled lotus, upon which sat a transformed Tathāgata. From his crown radiated ten streams of hundred-jeweled light, all manifesting universally. The great assembly gazed upward as the radiant Tathāgata proclaimed the divine incantation.” This is the emergence of the yang-spirit. Thus, it is called the Buddha’s child.

      "translated_text": "This reveals the secret of the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, enlightening later learners. Those who attain this Dao immediately transcend the sacred realm and do not fall into the dust of the mundane.\n\n**Diagram of the Transformed Body (Sixth)**\n**Diagram of Wall-Gazing (Seventh)**\n**Diagram of Shattering the Void (Eighth)**\n**Collected Sayings on the Sūtra of Wisdom-Life (Ninth)**\n\nHuayang states: To become a Buddha or an Ancestor is to realize the luminous nature of one’s original essence. Without attaining the Dao of *wisdom-life* and exhausting the leaks, one cannot fully awaken to the Way, nor directly enter the vast emptiness of the Tathāgata. Now, this luminous nature of the original essence, though it bears two names, springs from a single source. In samādhi, it is called *nature*; in the wisdom-illumination of samādhi, it is called *light*. *Wisdom-life* is the name the Tathāgata originally employed to instruct people. It is a Sanskrit term from the Western Regions, yet it is the very root of the Chinese people. The Confucians call it *precelestial qi*. It is the boat and ladder of Buddhist cultivation, the lever and handle of Ancestral attainment—precisely what Mencius meant by “nurturing the vast and flowing qi.”\n\n*Exhausting the leaks* is the name the World-Honored One used to describe the practice he demonstrated to Ānanda. It too is a Sanskrit term from the Western Regions. In China, it is called *leakage*; the Confucians call it *loss of essence*; physicians call it *dissipation of primordial qi*. Now, *exhausting the leaks* is the transformation of *wisdom-life*. Before it stirs, it is fundamentally *life*; when it stirs and one fails to refine it, upon exiting the pass it becomes the tangible *exhaustion of leaks*. Thus, the Confucians say *qi transforms into essence*. In the time of youthful purity, when the body is firm and unyielding, there is originally no name for *exhausting the leaks*. Round as a pearl, radiant as a flame—if at this time one encounters a true teacher, there is no need for the method of *exhausting the leaks*. One need only gather this round, radiant *wisdom-life* back into the central palace, constantly awakening, moment by moment illuminating, guarding and nurturing it for ten months. The Dao-embryo is cultivated, the Buddha-body formed—precisely what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* means by: “Having roamed the Dao-embryo, one personally attends the awakened response. With merit diligently accumulated and qi fully replete, one naturally emerges from the embryo.” At this stage, the Dharma-body is vast—precisely what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* means by: “Having formed and emerged from the embryo, one becomes the true child of the Buddha.” This is called the *sudden method*.\n\nHowever, after the age of sixteen, when the treasure of life is full, it begins to leak of its own accord. From this point onward, one refines it until it is without leakage—thus the Tathāgata calls it *exhausting the leaks*. If those who study the Buddha’s teachings do not humbly seek a teacher to point out the true method of fire-transformation, no matter how many seven-day retreats they undertake, no matter how long they sit in meditation or practice austerities, they will have no assurance of attainment. Without such assurance, how can the Dao ever be realized? Thus, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: “Without seeking this wondrous method, one will never attain bodhi.” Therefore, the Tathāgata, in great compassion, revealed to people the method of beginning practice, of replenishing and adding oil, of restoring the round, radiant *wisdom-life* and returning it to the central palace. This is called the *gradual method*. Thus, the Radiant Tathāgata said: “This old monk can graft a rootless tree and relight a lamp at the bottom of the sea.” Yet one must diligently cultivate—it is not something that can be accomplished in a single morning or evening. Thus, the World-Honored One told Ānanda: “The first *exhaustion of leaks* is difficult to achieve.” And *exhausting the leaks* is another name the Buddha used as a metaphor—it is the method of cultivating *wisdom-life* in this text.\n\nIf one cultivates *nature* but not *life*, habitual tendencies will be difficult to eradicate. Even if one reaches the state of vast and boundless emptiness, one will be nothing more than a ghost with the five supernatural powers, unable to align with the Tathāgata’s six supernatural powers. Therefore, the *Mahāvaipulya Mahāsannipāta Sūtra* states: “Those who cultivate the five supernatural powers, even after having cultivated them and nearly attained the *exhaustion of leaks*, do not realize it. Why? Out of compassion for sentient beings, they relinquish the *exhaustion of leaks* attainment and remain in the realm of ordinary beings.”\n\nThe *vast emptiness* is the ultimate void of the Dharma-nature’s perfection. Thus, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: “Nature is like empty space”—precisely what Shaozi meant by: “The Dao extends beyond the forms of heaven and earth; thought enters the transformations of wind and clouds.” Yet without the wind-and-fire method of refining *wisdom-life* and *exhausting the leaks*, one cannot harmonize and coalesce them to accomplish the great Dao. *Wind* is what fans the flames of fire. *Fire* is what transforms things through its power. Thus, the Tathāgata said: “A gentle wind stirs.” And again: “After fire-transformation, gather the relics.” When wind, fire, and *exhausting the leaks* are employed together, they naturally harmonize and coalesce to accomplish the great Dao.\n\nThus, the true transmission of the Buddha’s method follows a sequential order of practice—how could it lack evidence? The true Dao possesses a true sequence of practice. If one mixes up the order, it is not the Dao of the Tathāgata but merely a heterodox side-path. Now, this sequence is as follows: At the beginning, there is the work of harmonizing the true seed; when turning the hand, there is the work of refining the relics; when completing the hand, there is the work of nurturing the Dao-embryo; when releasing the hand, there is the work of emerging from the embryo and wall-gazing—such are the methods. Yet this sequence is not idly discussed. It is gathered from the secret texts of the Buddhas and Ancestors, compiled step by step as evidence. Beneath each phrase, a note is added to clarify it for fellow practitioners. In summary, there is no error in its verification. How could a mere word or half a phrase suffice as the Dao?\n\nNowadays in the Chan school, those who have not even received the true transmission presumptuously instruct others. Some speak of “before parents were born,” others ask, “Who is reciting the Buddha’s name?” These are nothing but the babbling of old women, deceiving the foolish men and women of the world. They wander east and west, calling it “seeking the Buddha’s Dharma,” only to end up empty-handed in old age. How can this be considered the Dao? Those of aspiration, observe this: it is truly *old-woman Chan*, *lip-service Chan*, *contention Chan*, *superficial Chan*, *livelihood Chan*. From ancient times to the present, none have not blindly led the blind, entrapping countless sincere devotees, sinking them into the nine springs, never to emerge and behold the radiance of the Buddha.",

      "translated_text": "For the Buddha-Dharma first entered China during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, though Buddhist monks had already arrived in the time of the First Emperor of Qin—only to be sent away and not adopted. Since the Han dynasty, countless distortions and falsehoods have arisen. Fortunately, Bodhidharma came to this land to correct these errors, transmitting the great lineage through a single thread. From the Sixth Patriarch to the present, however, deviations have only compounded upon deviations, giving rise to ninety-six heterodox schools and twenty-four misguided practices. Among these, the *seven-day intensive retreat* alone is a poison harming people, a fiery pit burying them alive.\n\nThe Western transmission of the Buddhist teaching spans twenty-eight patriarchs, and the six generations in the East originally knew nothing of this practice. It was fabricated by the disciples of Gaofeng, who themselves followed the misguided method of breath suppression—a mere byway, not the true path of the Tathāgata.\n\nSomeone may ask: How can this be known?\nThe answer lies in Gaofeng’s own words: “Enduring hunger, Shouchang, Jinsu.” Observe those who engage in the *seven-day retreat*—each one spits blood, not only failing to attain the great Dao but instead contracting consumptive illness, suffering miserably unto death. Is this not grievous? These people do not even understand the qi, blood, meridians, and collaterals of the human body—how could they possibly comprehend the Dao?\n\nWhen a person labors during the day, they rely entirely on the stillness of night to calm the spirit, allowing the postnatal heart and kidneys to harmonize. This is the root of nourishing the body. To claim that forcing people to remain awake for seven days and nights without sleep is the great Dao—how could this not lead to illness? Physicians say: If a person goes seven nights without sleep, the heart and kidneys cannot harmonize, and consumptive illness will surely follow—how much worse for forty-nine days?

      "translated_text": "After this punishment was abolished by the Tang Emperor, it has not dared to be recklessly employed to this day. The Emperor, upon witnessing that nine out of ten subjected to this penalty perished, consulted various medical texts, which stated that the five viscera all possess meridians and collaterals, connected to the spine’s main network, through which qi and blood circulate—this being the foundation of their movement and nourishment. A single strike to this region obstructs the flow of qi and blood, causing them to reverse and ascend, against which even the greatest physicians like Bian Que or Lu Yi would be powerless to save. Thus, the punishment was commuted to caning the buttocks.\n\nYet some, appending the names of certain monks to the yellow silk cords, claim this as \"transmission of the Dharma,\" deceiving the world with falsehoods upon falsehoods, entrapping beginners, and flooding the world with so-called \"Chan sayings\" from oral records. Even those of earnest aspiration find no path to pursue. They assume the Buddhas and Patriarchs are all born enlightened, yet they too waste away in vain, turning the radiance of the Buddha into darkness.\n\nThe treasury of the Great Canon is complete in its essential teachings, but because early disciples varied in depth of understanding and sharpness of capacity, and because later teachings became entangled with earlier ones, they refused to follow the sequential progression of the stages. Moreover, the Great Canon’s teachings encompass expedient methods, definitive methods, non-action, and action—how could they be discussed as one and the same? It depends entirely on whether one studies or not.\n\nThe Way of cultivating both nature and life resides within these teachings. Yet the later Patriarchs, having attained realization, refused to disclose their insights indiscriminately. Those who received transmission and succeeded did not reveal it openly to the masses, using expedient methods to subdue worldly monks, testing their awakening to prevent distractions and wayward thoughts. Those who truly awakened to the definitive method were given private, secret transmission—hence the \"special transmission outside the teachings,\" communicating only the essential message.\n\nFor instance, the World-Honored One did not transmit to his cousin Ānanda but privately entrusted Mahākāśyapa as the Second Patriarch. The Fifth Patriarch did not transmit to the head monk Shenxiu but secretly passed it to the attendant Huineng as the Sixth Patriarch. Thus, the great treasure of becoming a Buddha or Patriarch is never transmitted to the unworthy. Only those with aspirations surpassing even the Buddhas and Patriarchs, who comprehend the principles beyond, are deemed fit to receive it. The secrets of the Buddha-Dharma are therefore difficult for the world to inquire into, which is why they are not discussed openly or uniformly.\n\nSome manifest in non-action while concealing action. Non-action here refers to the method of nurturing the Dao-embryo after the period of wall-facing, not the mere \"dry sitting\" of non-action practiced by worldly monks. Action, on the other hand, refers to the coalescence and harmonization of the pre-celestial intent-qi, the wondrous functioning of cultivating the wisdom-life in the first half of the path—grounded in evidence, not the mundane action of the world.\n\nThus, the *Ratnakūṭa Sūtra* states: \"All dharmas are like illusions, yet within them there is one dharma, coalesced and harmonized, that surely comes to fruition.\" Another scriptural verse says:\n*\"Bodhisattvas cultivate the gate of liberation,\nTurning ever more toward compassion to seek the Buddha-Dharma.\nKnowing all conditioned things arise from harmony,\nThey delight in determination and diligently practice the Way.\"*\n\nYet another sutra states: \"The Two Vehicles fall into the vast and deep pit of non-action, unable to transcend and realize fruition.\" An ancient master said: \"Though action is provisional, abandoning it prevents the completion of merit and practice. Though non-action is real, pursuing it makes the attainment of sagehood difficult.\"\n\nToday’s Chan schools, upon hearing of action, dismiss it as attachment to form and reject it, unaware that this action is the wondrous action within stillness and concentration. Consider how heaven and earth are non-action, yet their generation of the myriad things is action. The supreme vehicle of the Buddha-Dharma operates likewise.\n\nWhen the human mind reaches the state of non-action, an entity within suddenly transcends and emerges. If one does not consciously grasp it, this entity scatters into external conditions, no longer belonging to oneself. This method of grasping and returning is thus called the \"method of action\"—just as the Sixth Patriarch spoke of \"going north to receive and deliver.\"\n\nSome manifest as \"no-thing\" while concealing \"thing.\" \"No-thing\" refers to the nature-work of the latter half of the path; \"thing\" refers to the life-work of the first half. Today’s false Chan and Daoist practitioners, upon hearing of \"thing,\" invariably reject it, unaware that this \"thing\" is the root of the Dao, the bridge of the Dharma, inherently possessed by all. It is not a product of thought but the entity within the Mysterious Pass.\n\nThus, the Sixth Patriarch said: \"I have a thing, without head or tail, without name or character, without back or front.\" To his successor, he said:\n*\"There is a thing prior to heaven and earth,\nNameless, originally quiescent and empty.\nIt can be the master of the myriad things,\nUnchanging through the four seasons.\"*\nThis is the pre-celestial thing. It governs the post-celestial, scattering without form or shadow, coalescing into śarīra.\n\nThus, Yuanwu said:\n*\"What is higher than heaven? That which gives birth to heaven.\nWhat is deeper than earth? That which nurtures earth.\nWhat is vaster than empty space? That which encompasses empty space.\nWhat surpasses Buddhas and Patriarchs? That which establishes Buddhas and Patriarchs.\"*\nThis is the root of transformation and nurturance, where self and other share the same path. Hence it is said: \"Self and other share the same great parents\"—this is it.\n\nFollowing the current, it gives birth to humans and things; reversing the flow, it becomes Buddha and Patriarch. Following the current, self and other share the same knowledge; reversing the flow, none but a teacher can comprehend and employ it. Thus, Master Yunfeng said: \"There is a thing that secretly saves people—how unfortunate that people do not know it!\" It is the pre-celestial pure yang, utterly unyielding qi. Scattered, it pervades the entire body; concentrated, it resides in the Mysterious Pass.\n\nThus, Hanzi said:\n*\"How precious is the natural thing,\nUnique and without companion.\nSeek it and it cannot be seen,\nEntering and exiting without door or gate.\nConcentrated, it is within the square inch;\nExtended, it is everywhere.\"*",

      "translated_text": "If you do not believe and accept it, though you meet, you will not encounter. Vast, it encompasses the Dharma realm; minute, it is as small as a grain of millet or a mote of dust. Thus, Master Yunfeng said: \"Though heaven and earth be gathered into a millet grain’s size, though it be so, it must first harmonize and coalesce before any thing arises.\" The World-Honored One called it the *bodhi* seed; what the dragon girl offered at the *Lotus Sutra* assembly was this very thing.\n\nAt times it manifests in non-action and conceals itself in action. Non-action is the method by which the Patriarchs subdue the masses—this is the lesser vehicle. Action is what the Patriarchs secretly transmit and conceal—this is the supreme vehicle. Common beings without roots cannot believe and accept it, so the World-Honored One said: \"In this defiled and evil world, I have accomplished this difficult task, attained *Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi*, and for all the world preach this hard-to-believe Dharma—this is most difficult.\" He also said: \"Such matters of the World-Honored One are hard for the world to believe. If the Patriarchs were to explain them to those of dull capacity, it would only invite slanderous speech.\" Thus, the *Lotus Sutra* states: \"At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra: Stop, there is no need to speak further. If this matter were spoken, all the gods and humans in the world would be shocked and doubtful.\" And again: \"Only this one fact is true; the other two are not real.\"\n\nMoreover, \"action\" is not the affair of heterodox paths—it is the stirring of the life of wisdom, the movement of the primordial pass that gives rise to things. With my intent I govern it; with breath I draw it in. Harmonizing the true seed, turning the Dharma wheel, gathering, refining—all are the work of intent, breath, and the life of wisdom. Thus it is called \"action.\" The life of wisdom is another name for primordial *qi*. When primordial *qi* arises, if not gathered, how could it not scatter? Thus, Master Xingyang said: \"Advance a step and you lose the principle; retreat a step and you miss the affair\"—this is it.\n\nAt times it manifests in the lesser vehicle and conceals itself in the greater vehicle. The lesser vehicle’s methods are the expedient teachings the Chan masters employ: sitting in meditation, reciting Buddha’s name, studying sutras, planting the karmic roots of good deeds. The greater vehicle’s methods are the secret transmissions the Patriarchs received: the life of wisdom, the exhaustion of the yin of desire—these are the Buddha-fruits of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood. What has been said above is but a general outline.\n\nSome explanations are easy to understand and their analogies shallow; these should be studied section by section with care, not glanced over hastily. Once you have penetrated the meaning without doubt, seek confirmation again, lest you cling to partial views and take your teaching from the mouths of deluded men—how mistaken that would be! The simple and accessible words are the true formula of nature and life. Without receiving the oral instructions, it is difficult to awaken late in life. You must piece together the front and back, thoroughly investigate the stages, and then seek confirmation from a true teacher to avoid wasting this lifetime in vain practice.\n\nWhat is transmitted and certified in today’s monasteries is not the Tathāgata’s true Dharma but the names of certain monks passed down from the \"yellow-robed\" ones—this is called \"Buddha-Dharma.\" To recognize it as such is to err. These are false teachings fabricated by deluded men after the Sixth Patriarch who never received the true transmission, scheming to compete for abbacy. They deceive later students and mislead countless faithful. Since it is not the Buddha-Dharma, it becomes a source of contention.\n\nThus I say:\n*\"To shed the mundane and leave the dust, seek one who has passed through—\nAs the ancients said: ‘To find the path down the mountain, ask one who has come and gone.’\"*\n\nOne who has passed through is one who has received the instructions—whether already accomplished or yet to begin, the instructions are the same.\n\n*\"To cut off desire and awaken to the Dao, a true teacher is precious.\"*\n\nMoreover, cutting off desire is the first precept of the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the bridge to becoming a Buddha. If one who wears the robe and carries the staff—a son of Śākyamuni—does not sever the mechanism of desire yet calls this \"cultivating the Dao,\" would this not be a laughingstock to the noble ones of Confucianism and Daoism? Outwardly, they may appear dignified, but inwardly, they are no different from ordinary beings—truly shameful!\n\nMoreover, in the matter of cutting off desire, without seeking a true teacher, by what method can it be severed? When seeking a teacher, first ask about the beginning of this method—all else is heterodox. No matter how many methods they point to and explain, they will not accord with your body and mind.\n\n*\"Today’s Buddhist teachings—reciting sutras, invoking Buddha’s name, sitting in Chan meditation, holding seven-day retreats, investigating *huatou*—beyond these, there is nothing. These are but yellow leaves to stop a child’s crying—what benefit do they bring to body and mind?\"*\n\n*\"Extravagant talk beyond the norm is not the supreme Dao.\"*\n\nToday’s Buddhists, not having received the true transmission, open their mouths to speak of this bodhisattva or that Buddha, lacking ability themselves and using such grandmotherly talk to deceive the foolish. They say, \"This monk died and attained the Dao; that monk died and attained the great Dao.\" If death alone attains the Dao, then all the corpses in the world would be men of attainment! They do not know that one who has attained the Dao, while alive, can perform transformations without limit—only then is it the supreme Dao.\n\n*\"A single word, subtly pointed, is the good physician.\"*\n\nA single word is honest speech, not lengthy texts or flowery, clever language. Thus the Fifth Patriarch said: \"Master to master, secretly transmit the original sound.\" Subtle pointing is like the Fifth Patriarch’s midnight instruction to the Sixth Patriarch, like the World-Honored One’s pointing to Mahākāśyapa from a boat. For one who has attained the Dao, all doubts and illnesses vanish; the scriptures of the storehouse teachings are all thoroughly understood—thus, a good physician.\n\n*\"Having obtained it, briefly test it from the beginning—\nIn a moment’s effort, the fruit brings its own joy.\"*\n\nOnce you have received the true instructions, begin cultivation from the very start. If it is indeed the Dao, when desire stirs, gather the mind to govern it, use breath to refine it—without even a moment’s effort, the root of desire will retract, intent and *qi* will harmonize, the mind will be still, the body refreshed, and you will secretly rejoice.",
      "overlap_context": "t. Thus, Master Yunfeng said: \"There is a thing that secretly saves people—how unfortunate that people do not know it!\" It is the pre-celestial pure yang, utterly unyielding qi. Scattered, it pervades the entire body; concentrated, it resides in the Mysterious Pass.\n\nThus, Hanzi said:\n*\"How precious is the natural thing,\nUnique and without companion.\nSeek it and it cannot be seen,\nEntering and exiting without door or gate.\nConcentrated, it is within the square inch;\nExtended, it is everywhere.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, I have heard it said in the *Heart Sutra*: \"Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva.\" Huayang remarks: This is the critical threshold where the Tathāgata, by celestial grace, teaches the proper method of dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming* at the very outset. Yet how lamentable that ordinary beings, lacking true transmission, mistake mere念念 recitation for \"observing Avalokiteśvara\"—a grievous error. Little do they know that this念念 arises from the seeds of habitual *vijñāna*, not the primordial source of the Dao. Thus, Master Cheng asked: Is this so-called \"correct Dao and settled principle\" truly the heart? Or is it not the heart? Herein lies the profound message urging one to awaken to a different understanding.\n\nNow, \"manifest\" (*xiàn*) and \"bodhisattva\" are the Tathāgata’s sublime metaphors for two entities, the cardinal principle of dual cultivation—how could they be reduced to one? If this念念 were the Dao, then the Dao would be inconstant indeed. Thus, the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* states: \"All sentient beings mistakenly take the four great elements as their bodily form and the shadows of the six sense-objects as their mind.\" The *Primordial Wondrous School* also says: \"The numinous platform of wisdom-nature is the root of birth and death; deluded thoughts and conditioned *qi* arise only from prior sense-objects, giving rise to discrimination.\"\n\nTherefore, the Dharma-transmitting Tathāgata declared: \"Within the Hall of the Empty King, no traces remain. If one takes this as real, then the bodhisattva remains buried ninefold in the earth, unable to emerge and transform, to attain the Tathāgata’s wondrous form, squandering this great causal opportunity in vain.\" Furthermore, this is but the transformation of the *yin-qi* and *shishen* within the heart—through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, it has ever been thus. The bodhisattva, deluded within the *sheli*, is beguiled into pursuing the dust of desire, unable to attain liberation and thus failing to realize fruition. Transmigrating through kalpas, lost in delusion—all because they know not the bodhisattva’s origin, mistakenly clinging to this *shishen* as true.\n\nThus, Chan Master Jing said:\n*\"Those who study the Dao long yet fail to recognize the true\nAre but those who, from the outset, took the recognizing spirit as real.\nThe root of birth and death since beginningless time—\nFools call it their original body.\"*\n\nMaster Nanquan also said: \"The mind is not the Buddha; wisdom is not the Dao.\" And Mazu added: \"‘The mind is the Buddha’—this is but a means to quiet a child’s wailing. How dreadful!\" Yet today’s Buddhists, hearing that \"the mind is not the Buddha, wisdom is not the Dao,\" do they not fall into emptiness and nihility, left adrift and anchorless?\n\nOne may ask: What then is to be cultivated? The answer: *Guan* is the numinous radiance within our right mindfulness. Those who have not received true transmission call it \"original nature.\" Now, the bodhisattva dwells in the Pure Land, separated from this *guan* by eight inches and four *fen*. Without *guan*, they cannot meet—precisely what the following text means by \"harmonizing and coalescing, decisively accomplishing fruition.\" The bodhisattva, being the true essence of wisdom-life, is called Buddha-nature. From the moment one leaves the womb with a cry, *guan* and the bodhisattva are sundered by the eyes’ gaze. Moreover, the bodhisattva is hidden and profoundly secret; without a teacher’s direct pointing, even the most keenly intelligent and spiritually awakened cannot perceive it.\n\nThe *Daoxin* says: \"The mind of the Dao is most subtle.\" From this point onward, day and night, in all affairs—whether wisdom, intelligence, or discernment—it is always the *shishen* at work. Thus, the ancestral masters declared: \"You lack Buddha-nature.\" Therefore, the Tathāgata, moved by compassion, taught all sentient beings to constantly observe this bodhisattva. The bodhisattva, having received the wisdom-power of this numinous radiance, over time naturally awakens as from a dream, suffused with warmth like steaming vapor, vibrant as a pearl in a basin. Suddenly, one becomes lucidly alert, emitting great light. When the time and power are ripe, it surges upward like a tidal wave, merging with our *shixing* to become one. At this point, the *shixing* dies, and the Buddha-nature’s numinosity shines forth—vivid, self-possessed, once more the true master. Its light pervades the trichiliocosm; the six supernormal powers are all complete. Amidst all dust and defilement, I alone abide in serene singularity, perfectly fused with the Great Void. This is what is meant by \"all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature.\"\n\nThough it be so, following the current leads to becoming human or other beings; reversing it leads to becoming a Buddha or patriarch. The transformations of ordinary and sacred—all arise from this single entity, this \"one thing, one *Taiji*.\" With this *Taiji*, there is awareness and speech; without it, the eyes droop and the mouth closes. Physicians call it \"true fire\"—formless and shadowless, concealed behind the navel and before the kidneys, slightly below, suspended in an empty cavity. The ancients called this the Pure Land’s homeland, the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the wondrous existence within true emptiness. With this true fire, it steams and nurtures the formed; without it, breath ceases and form decays.\n\nThe Sixth Patriarch said: \"The mind is the earth; nature is the king. When the king dwells upon the earth of the mind, as long as the king is present, the body and mind endure; when the king departs, the body and mind perish.\" Yet this mind is not the fleshy heart—it is the mind of the Dao. Thus it is said: \"The mind of the Dao resides at the North Star, around which all stars revolve\"—this is it. Among all Buddhists under heaven, if one does not cultivate this bodhisattva, is there any other Dao to cultivate? If there were, it would belong to heterodox side doors, not the Dao of Avalokiteśvara.\n\nThe *Ratnakūṭa Sūtra* states: \"Harmonizing and coalescing, decisively accomplishing fruition.\" This is the Tathāgata’s esoteric teaching, the secret text of the entire *Tripiṭaka*—the precious method of dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*. Thus it is said: \"decisively accomplishing fruition.\" Alas, from Emperor Ming of Han to the present day, not a single person has expounded this Dao. Only Bodhidharma and the Second Patriarch Huike received it in secret. Thus, their very flesh transformed, and they ascended to the Great Void, attaining the golden body as proof.\n\nBodhidharma hinted at it, and Huike, in his scriptures, elucidated this Dao. Yet disciples concealed and sealed his books. I now clarify and complete the exposition, wishing that fellow cultivators may universally realize it, avoid straying into side doors, escape illness and premature death, and swiftly attain the Great Dao.\n\nNow, *he* (harmony) is the *yin-qi* within the heart, which goes to harmonize with the *yang-qi* in the kidneys. When the *yin-qi* receives this *yang-qi*, there is a place for the mind to settle and life to take root—thus it is called *he* (harmony).",

      "translated_text": "The *he* (union) is the *yang-qi* within the kidneys, which receives the *yin-qi* from the heart. When the *yang-qi* receives this luminous *qi*, it forms a body of contraction, gathering, and firmness—thus it is called *he* (union). As the *Yijing* states, \"The interplay of *yin* and *yang* is called the Dao; an excess of either *yin* or *yang* is called illness.\" From ancient times, buddhas and patriarchs have always cultivated both *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life), never leaning to one side.\n\nMoreover, *ning* (congealing) is the method of congealing the spirit; *ji* (gathering) is the way of gathering life. If life is not gathered, bodhi cannot be attained. This is what Mencius meant by \"accumulating righteousness to give rise to it\"—here, *xing* and *ming* are cultivated together, nourishing the spirit and *qi* in a simple and easily attainable manner. Yet people do not know of dual cultivation, so the Tathāgata said, \"Harmony and union are the way.\"\n\nSince leaving the mother’s womb, a person’s spirit cannot attend to their *qi*, nor can their *qi* attend to their spirit. The spirit is stored in the heart and expressed through the two eyes, while the seven apertures share in its daily upward dissipation. The *qi* is stored in the kidneys and expressed through the root of lust, dissipating downward in the quiet of night. How much endowment can one truly possess? When it is exhausted—alas!\n\nWithout seeking a teacher’s guidance to congeal and gather, one’s cultivation is nothing more than this single *yin*-spirit within the heart. Little do they know that this spirit, being purely *yin*, cannot independently achieve the supreme Dao. Thus, the World-Honored One taught people to, in all twelve hours of the day, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, gather the subtle spirit and congeal it into the *ming* (life). When *ming* receives this spirit, it is like a minister receiving their sovereign—submissive and settled, never daring to dissipate or lean to one side. With such effort, and upon awakening to the method of gathering *yang* as it arises, the young may achieve this in a month, those of middle age in three to five months. Within the life-gate, imperceptibly, something arises from nothing, its origin unknown. Suddenly, the true mechanism stirs, and the bliss is beyond words. At this point, one must guard it closely and swiftly turn the Dharma-wheel. Thus, the Tathāgata offers humanity this crucial teaching: if you cultivate according to this method of harmony, union, congealing, and gathering, you will surely attain accomplishment.\n\nThe *Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch* says, \"When sentient beings come, plant the seed.\" For *qing* (passion) is the celestial mechanism for initiating the cultivation of the wisdom-life. Without this *qing*, buddhahood can never be achieved. It is like a farmer without seed hoping for a harvest—how foolish! Today’s Chan monks fail to attain buddhahood simply because they do not understand this *qing*.\n\nIn the past, the Fifth Patriarch’s former life was the Pine-Planting Daoist, who sought the Dao from the Fourth Patriarch. Seeing his aged form, the Fourth Patriarch said, \"You may transform and return.\" The Daoist indeed died standing, then reincarnated into the Zhou family to attain the true Dao. Since he could die standing and re-enter the womb without relying on a father, was he not already accomplished in the Dao? What more did he seek?\n\nMazu said, \"It is not a thing.\" The Sixth Patriarch said, \"Lustful nature is buddha-nature.\" These two statements fully revealed the celestial mechanism. Thus, Chan Master Longya said:\n*\"Human passion is thick, the Dao’s passion faint,\nHow could the world know the Dao’s use of passion?\nWith passion but no Dao, how long can it last?\nPassion alone cannot sustain the Way.\"*\n\nThis single word *qing* has been annotated endlessly since Emperor Ming of Han’s time. Without grasping the method of the wisdom-life, one might mistake it for worldly passion, learning only a few clichéd Chan phrases and claiming enlightenment, deceiving the foolish. Yet in future generations, those with clear eyes will see through this and mock it. If it were truly a corrupting thing, how could the Fifth and Sixth Patriarchs have practiced it and deceived later generations? The Fifth and Sixth Patriarchs, being direct heirs of the Tathāgata, indeed concealed the Dao of the wisdom-life and did not transmit it to the unworthy.\n\nSomeone may ask, \"What is this *qing*?\" Huayang said, \"This *qing* is the nurturing of the wisdom-life, the mechanism that suddenly opens the primordial gate. Though the wisdom-life is stored in the primordial gate, when still, it arises outwardly, attaching to the external form and stirring. When it coincides with the intent in my heart, awareness arises—this outward movement is called *qing*.\" Hence, the method of closing the *yang*-gate.\n\nThe Tathāgata said, \"Without recognizing movement and stillness, studying the Dao is futile.\"\n\nAnother may ask, \"What does it mean to plant the seed?\" The answer: \"This *qing* is the path of birth leading to buddhahood, whether following or reversing the flow. The beginning of the Dao’s creation cannot return without true intent. For those learning Buddhism, once they understand the mechanism of bodily movement, they should congeal their true intent from stillness into the life-palace. Congealing it repeatedly over time, the celestial mechanism will stir, and imperceptibly, the life-palace will produce bodhi. Thus, it is called planting the seed.\"\n\nAnother may ask, \"What is the method of refinement?\" The answer: \"Having understood the method of congealing, one must know the method of refinement—*lian* (refinement) is fire. Fire cannot blaze or transform things without wind. Thus, the World-Honored One said, 'A gentle wind stirs,' and 'After fire transforms, gather the relics.' Those who study must cause the wind of breath to reverse-blow the true fire of the life-palace, drawing back the outwardly arising wisdom-life to its origin. Congeal it steadily, like a fire-seed in a furnace, continuously, like the bellows’ movement. Fumigate and refine it, transforming the tangible into the intangible. Through such cultivation, not only does the wisdom-life within the palace not dissipate outwardly, but this dynamic mechanism also supplements its deficiencies. This is what the Confucians call 'creation and transformation, ceaseless generation.' Over time, the foundation of life becomes full, and one is said to have attained an undying lifespan. Thus, the Tathāgata, when teaching Kāśyapa, called him the 'Undying Arhat.'\"\n\nThe *Mahāprajñāpāramitāhṛdaya Sūtra* says, \"At that time...\"",

When the *yin-qi* receives this *yang-qi*, there is a place for the mind to settle and life to take root—thus it is called *he* (harmony).",

This is the Tathāgata’s urgent injunction to later generations, a wakeful reminder of utmost urgency. Moreover, this \"time\" is not the time of hours or seasons; it is the moment of stirring within meditative stillness.\n\nThe ancient worthies said:\n*\"If one asks when this time arises, there is no fixed hour—*\n*Only the knowing heart knows in the clear wind and bright moon.\"*\n\nThe Confucians say:\n*\"When the moon reaches the heart of heaven,*\n*When the wind comes to the surface of water.\"*\n\nThough these venerable masters revealed such wondrous celestial signs through their metaphors, they never explicitly named what this \"time\" is, nor instructed how one might employ it.

It is also named the *ravenous tiger* that devours one’s nature and sucks out one’s marrow; no hero or stalwart of the Three Teachings, lacking true transmission, escapes being undone by it. The determined scholars and lofty persons of old necessarily first subdued this ravenous tiger before attaining their Dao-fruit.\n\nYet its arising manifests thus: a gentle warmth like bathing in balmy waters, a blazing intensity like fire about to ignite—an overwhelming, vigorous, and fierce nature that steams downward to the root of lust, overawing and commanding all the vital essences of the body, leaving none beyond its dominion.

      "translated_text": "Moreover, the notion of *timeliness* is the esoteric secret of the Buddhist Teaching—most urgent indeed. The World-Honored One once preached in the Dragon Palace of Ketumatī. The preceding passage has already encompassed every practical application of timeliness. Yet, fearing that worldly people might fall into emptiness, the Teaching here explicitly designates the locus of true reality, ensuring that practitioners do not lose their grounding.\n\nNow, the Dragon Palace is a metaphor in the Sanskrit of the Western Heaven. In the Middle Kingdom, it is called the *Cinnabar Field*, also known as the *qi-cavity*; physicians term it the *essence-orifice*—its names are many. In the Western Heaven, it is further called the *Pure Land*, the *Realm*, the *Sea of Suffering*, the *Sea-Bottom*, the *Land of Ultimate Bliss*, or *Udāna*—its appellations are manifold, yet all refer to the place where the true seed harmonizes.\n\nThus, the *Mohe Zhiguan* states: \"The Sanskrit *Udāna* is the Cinnabar Field of this land.\" Hence, those who attained the Dao in recent times, fearing that people might not awaken, also called it the *Furnace*. This is the compassionate metaphor of the patriarchs, guiding people to recognize a concrete locus. Just as a blacksmith, wishing to forge a sharp and exquisite implement, cannot succeed without a furnace, so too is the practice of cultivation.\n\nWhat, then, is the Furnace? It is the place where transformation and formation occur. The method is easily understood. Thus, the *Heart Sutra* commentary says: \"Gather it and place it within the cinnabar furnace, refining it until the Golden Crow glows red.\" The *Radiant Tathāgata* says: \"Fire arises in the furnace,\" and again: \"Fire in the furnace reveals the celestial mechanism; failing to awaken to the Western advent is delusion.\"\n\nMaster Yuantong of the Chan school said: \"Hide the body within the Northern Dipper.\" The Northern Dipper is the Dragon Palace mentioned above; \"hiding the body\" is the condensation spoken of earlier. The patriarchs teach that if one constantly conceals one’s true thought within the Northern Dipper, the mind becomes empty and the life-force naturally stabilizes. Thus, the verse given to the Great Being reads: \"With an empty mind, one returns having passed the examination.\"\n\nMaster Jiwu said: \"Concentrate the spirit and withdraw it into this orifice, and the *qi* will follow the spirit, naturally returning to this place.\" Moreover, Jiwu fully grasped the complete essence of Tathāgata Damo and the orthodox transmission of the wisdom-life. Thus, his transformations were unfathomable and boundless. During the Yongzheng era, he repeatedly appeared in Taiyi, manifesting dozens of yang-bodies. Every household had its own Jiwu—eating, drinking, and conversing. When he concealed himself, no trace remained. At times, he bestowed gold, silver, or beautiful women; at others, he displayed ferocious tigers, water, or fire. Among his disciples, all worldly desires and thoughts were extinguished.\n\nNow, *condensation* means *to move*; the *orifice* is the Cinnabar Field, also called the Furnace. This signifies the locus from which *qi* arises—when one applies effort. For *qi* moves and attaches to external forms, issuing forth. If left to its own course, how can it serve as the root of the Dao? Therefore, the patriarchs instruct: at this moment, swiftly condense the spirit into the Cinnabar Field. When *qi* is gathered by the spirit’s absorption, it too returns.\n\nMoreover, this *qi* is not the *qi* of breathing but the *qi* of the primordial—what Mencius called the *vast and flowing qi*. This *qi* is guarded by the Buddhist Teaching and all accomplished patriarchs, who refuse to disclose it outright. Instead, they employ metaphors from external things, allowing people to awaken on their own. Only when one understands is the secret transmission given. Thus, it is called \"a special transmission outside the teachings\"—another name for *qi*.\n\nIn the Buddhist Teaching, it is called the *Staff*, the *Tin Staff*, *Dhyāna*, *Plucking the Reed*, *White Snow*, *Golden Lotus*, *Respectful Fruit*, *Cave Water*, *Sea Water*, *Bright Star*, *Western River Water*, *Caoxi Water*, *Water Buffalo*, *Sea-Bottom Goodness*, *Furnace Fire*, *Muni Pearl*, *Sea-Bottom Mud Ox*, *Sea-Bottom Bright Pearl*, *Sea-Bottom Blossoming*, *Furnace Incense Smoke*, *Affair*, *Thing*—its names are innumerable, yet in truth, they all refer to this single *qi*.\n\nThus, Chan Master Yellow Leaf, upon seeking the Sixth Patriarch and completing his cultivation, sighed and said: \"The Dao is nothing but *qi*.\" This single utterance revealed the celestial mechanism in its entirety. He also said: \"If the practice is unceasing, with every breath returning here, after one or two months, one will naturally feel the orifice suffused with warmth, the *qi* gently stirring.\"\n\n*Breath* is the *qi* of inhalation and exhalation, which the Buddha likened to *wind*—also called the *Staff*, like an old man leaning on a cane to walk. For those cultivating the wisdom-life, without this breath to blow and nurture, the leakage will not be transformed, and the śarīra will not form. Thus, the Chan master said: \"Before reaching the end of water and the exhaustion of mountains, pass the time as a companion,\" meaning this.\n\nNow, the root of human breath originally lies in the Cinnabar Field, but people only know how to exhale, not how to draw it in. Those who receive the true transmission possess a spirit in the Cinnabar Field capable of connecting with the breath. Thus, the Chan master said: \"The flute without holes, blown from both ends.\" Only when spirit and *qi* unite does one naturally become warm. The Dharma Wheel turns of its own accord—whether in one or two months depends on whether one is young or old. For the young, the furnace’s efficacious mechanism stirs within a month; for the old, it may take several months before signs of fusion and integration appear, and the warm *qi* begins to move.\n\nThe *Pure Light Tathāgata* said:\n*\"The golden youth, awakening, left the royal palace,\nUnknowing, he entered the Dharma-sea like a rhinoceros.\nSeeking to return to his native land,\nOnly at Spirit Mountain’s pagoda did he find the trace.\"*\n\nThe \"prince\" is the World-Honored One. When the World-Honored One aspired to cultivate, a heavenly deity transformed into a white horse, carrying the prince out of the royal palace and soaring to the Snow Mountains. There, he cut his hair with a golden knife. Initially, without receiving the true transmission, he practiced heterodox methods, so his leakage was not transformed, and no achievement was attained. His body became emaciated and weak. Later, he received the orthodox transmission of the wisdom-life from Asita and thus attained Buddhahood.\n\nThus, the *Lotus Sutra* says: \"The immortal bestowed upon the Buddha the wondrous Dharma, and the Tathāgata thereby attained Buddhahood.\"",

      "translated_text": "The *Record of Buddhist Lineages* further states: When Asita saw the prince’s emaciated form, he said to him, \"You should drink cow’s milk to restore your original vitality.\" The prince indeed drank the milk, and his thirty-two marks were thereby fully restored. His Dao-fruit reached perfection, and he sought the Buddha Dīpaṃkara to bear witness.\n\nWhen the World-Honored One first applied himself to cultivating the supreme Dao, without waiting for months to pass, he suddenly beheld the morning star and sighed, saying, \"All sentient beings possess Buddha-nature; how could they fail to attain this Dao except through their own fault?\" The Buddha-nature of which the World-Honored One spoke is the wisdom-life.\n\nThe \"cow\" is qi; the \"sea\" is the cinnabar field. If one seeks this cow, its hidden place lies within the Dharma-ocean—nowhere else. Thus it is said: \"Within the Northern Dipper, the body is concealed.\" \"Spirit Mountain\" is the heart; \"beneath the pagoda\" is the cinnabar field. When the Tathāgata teaches people to cultivate the Dao, he first instructs them to cultivate beneath the pagoda, and only afterward does the cow return to its native land as verification. Thus the *Hidden Sutra* says: \"Every person possesses a Spirit Mountain pagoda; it is best to cultivate beneath the Spirit Mountain pagoda.\" \"Knowing the trace\" refers to the sudden arising of something from nothing within the cinnabar field. Without awaiting external discussion, one’s own mind becomes aware of warmth, harmony, and ease—a scene of springtime unbounded. The joy is inexhaustible, just as Mazu said: \"It reaches the skin and hair, suffusing the four limbs.\"\n\n\"Return\" means to revert; \"native land\" is the field of the heart. Only by descending from the middle and returning to the upper does one transform consciousness into Buddha-nature, forge habitual thoughts into right mindfulness, and allow consciousness to die so that the original nature appears—a radiant master. Thus it is called \"returning to the native land.\"\n\nMaster Yuan Tong said: \"When the host of yin is entirely stripped away, the one yang revives. To perceive the heart of heaven and earth, one must recognize the method of riding yin.\" \"The host of yin being entirely stripped away\" refers to the eleventh month of the year and, in the human body, to the Northern Sea. \"The one yang reviving\" refers to the winter solstice in the year and, in the human body, to the arising of yang. The heart of heaven is precisely the place where yang arises. As Shaozi said: \"At the midpoint of the winter solstice, the heart of heaven remains unchanged.\"\n\nTo perceive this heart, one must seek the method of refinement, and only then will there be a visible countenance to behold—the true seed from which the method arises, just as the World-Honored One beheld the morning star. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When establishing a bodhimandala, first take the powerful white ox from the Snow Mountains; one may use its dung to plaster the ground.\" The \"bodhimandala\" here refers to the initial step in cultivating the Buddha-Dao. \"Plastering with ox dung\" is precisely the foundation for refining the wisdom-life.\n\nWhen the World-Honored One taught people to cultivate the Dao, he first instructed them to refine the wisdom-life. If one does not refine the pure yang of the wisdom-life but instead begins by cultivating only the yin spirit within the heart, how can one avoid encountering the yin demons described in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*? Nowadays, those in the Chan school who cultivate nature without cultivating life often become inverted, contracting illnesses and dying prematurely. Though they may verbally claim sudden enlightenment, the ten grounds, and the three vehicles, they often end up aging in vain, unaware of the excellence of the Snow Mountain white ox’s dung. They vainly grind bricks to make mirrors and collect snow for sustenance, wasting many years. Without establishing the foundation of life, how can there be any principle by which the nature-Dao may be accomplished? It is like actors on a stage who claim to be Emperor Gaozu or King Xiang Yu.\n\nNow, \"snow\" is white, and white is the true color of the Western Direction—an allusion to the qi of the life-gate. Thus, when the Tathāgata taught people to cultivate the Western Pure Land, it was precisely this. A skilled physician further clarified: \"Before the two kidneys hangs a white circle; the precelestial water and fire of life and destiny reside within it, formless and traceless, empty and vast. The wisdom-life is precisely within it.\" If one does not swiftly cultivate oneself, how can one abide long? Chasing fame and profit dissipates it; pursuing sensual desires destroys the true. Those who leave the household, reciting sutras and sitting in dry meditation, deplete their qi and exhaust their spirit—like a lamp running out of oil, extinguished before reaching fifty. Thus it is called \"Snow Mountain.\"\n\nMoreover, \"life\" is the original qi. The qi is unparalleled in its firmness; its color is white and flawless. Thus it is called the \"powerful white ox.\" The qi’s concealment and manifestation encompass heaven and earth, bear the myriad things, vast without boundary, subtle without core. Though sought, it leaves no trace; through cultivation, it appears before one. It transcends buddhas and surpasses ancestors—there is nothing that is not this qi. This is what Mencius meant by \"utmost greatness, utmost firmness\"—how could it be false?\n\nYet the qi’s transformations are such that in the prime of life, it naturally gathers; in extreme stillness, it naturally arises. If one does not preserve and guard it, it dissipates. Thus it is called \"dung.\" If dissipation occurs day after day without early fortification of the root of life, how long can it last? This is what the Confucians meant by \"use it, and it becomes a path; do not use it, and it becomes overgrown with brambles.\"\n\nNow, dung is the supreme treasure for splitting demons and the ladder to buddhahood. Without taking this dung to cultivate, nine out of ten refinements will be empty. It is like someone wishing to build a fine house without a foundation—how could they dwell in it? The ancients of resolve knew the source of this dung: in stillness, they nurtured it; in activity, they gathered it. They returned it to their original ground, using fire to refine and fortify their own foundation—this is called \"plastering the bodhimandala.\"\n\nOnce the foundation of the site is established, one cannot lack a good spiritual friend. Moment by moment, one must seat one’s true intention within it, allowing no thought to arise. How then can the eight winds shake one? As Kangjie said: \"When no thought arises, even spirits and gods cannot know—how much less can I?\" Who alone remains alert? No matter how many demons and monsters assail, I am hidden here, at ease and free. Thus it is said: \"When the master sits in the bodhimandala, he does not encounter demonic kinds!\" This is what Ānanda meant by \"sitting in full lotus on the surface of flowing water, entering extinction.\"\n\nThe annotator and author of this passage breathe through the same nostrils.",

      "translated_text": "The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* further states: \"One must sever the impetus of lust so that both body and mind are cut off, and even the nature of severance is extinguished—only then may one aspire to the Buddha’s bodhi.\" Since ancient times, none who attained the Way failed first to sever the impetus of lust before transcending buddhas and surpassing patriarchs. Though all who take up the monastic life know the teaching of severing lust in body and mind, the term \"impetus of lust\" alone remains obscure to the world. Not only do they lack the method of cultivation and the understanding of its principles, but even their bodies and minds cannot be made truly free of lust. Why? Once the impetus of lust arises, the form blazes like wildfire, its speed akin to a raging wind. Without the proper method, how can one avoid the afflictions that entangle body and mind? Yet if this impetus is absent, body and mind remain at peace, free from all distress.\n\nThus, the World-Honored One, knowing the peril of this impetus and the difficulty of mastering it alone, taught others how to subdue it. This subduing is not an empty act—there must be a method to it. As Chan Master Cai said: \"The patriarchs’ intent is like empty space, yet not empty; the spiritual mechanism contends for merit through effort.\" This method is most simple and easy, yet without prior good fortune, one may stand before it and never hear of it. Without hearing, how can the impetus of lust ever listen to itself? If one does not swiftly and humbly seek a teacher, no matter how many thousands of times one refines and cultivates, one cannot escape its afflictions. Thus, in recent times, monasteries have seen many karmic obstructions. Even those who claim to be good spiritual friends lack the proper method, and many secretly engage in lustful conduct before and behind their bodies. For this reason, the two great ministers Bi and Shu banished such monks to military exile—this is heaven’s judgment upon their sins.\n\n**Question:** What is the root of lust?\n**Answer:** The impetus of lust is what the World-Honored One called the \"root of lust.\" The root’s form lies externally, while the impetus resides within. Without cultivation, how can one avoid its entanglement of body and mind? This aligns with Mencius’ saying that \"qi can also move the will.\"\n\n**Question:** What method can subdue it?\n**Answer:** Those who obtain the secret instruction, when the impetus is about to arise, employ spirit to govern it, and the impetus naturally subsides. This is what Mencius meant by \"the will is the commander.\" Through breath, one gathers it, causing the qi to return of itself—this is what Bodhidharma called \"gathering.\" Spirit serves as fire, breath as wind. Though the impetus arises from qi, within it lies the potential for exhausting all leaks. Without refining it here, it will again entangle body and mind. Using the elixir field as the furnace, opening and closing as the bellows, refining with fire, fanning with wind, warmth as the sign of efficacy, and ease as the state of no obstruction—through long cultivation, the impetus dies, the nature of lust is severed, and even the nature of severance is extinguished. Body and mind attain peace. The three kinds of lustful affairs no longer gather, and what difficulty remains in aspiring to the Buddha’s bodhi? This is the secret method transmitted among all sages and patriarchs, never before revealed. I have now disclosed it entirely.\n\nFor those who call themselves disciples of the Buddha yet do not cultivate the three kinds of lustful affairs, claiming to be good spiritual friends—these are the fifty-three kinds of demons spoken of in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*. Or if some say I am mistaken, later learners should verify this against the original text. Could the World-Honored One be wrong?\n\nChan Master Jiwu said: When the impetus arises, concentrate the spirit and enter the elixir field. Employ the martial fire to gather and return it, using it to refine and temper. When the impetus has not yet arisen, use the spirit to illuminate the elixir field, employing the civil fire to guard without separation, steaming and simmering. Only through such awakening does one attain the arising of true spirit. The arising of the impetus is the movement of qi in the elixir field. Once the spirit is concentrated, this impetus moves and is subdued by the spirit, naturally inseparable—like a magnet attracting iron, penetrating barriers and merging as one.\n\nThe patriarchs, fearing that when qi arises it may be as fierce as a raging tiger and difficult to subdue, said: \"Use the martial fire.\" This truly exhausts the heavenly mechanism, and their compassion is fully expressed. For ten thousand generations, those who study the Buddha’s teachings will all receive its grace. The use of martial fire is the esoteric method of cultivating the Way, the secret mechanism of becoming a buddha. It is transmitted heart-to-heart by buddhas and mouth-to-mouth by patriarchs, yet awakening to it is exceedingly difficult. Thus, the Fifth Patriarch said: \"Masters secretly instruct in the original sound.\"\n\nThough the World-Honored One and Bodhidharma spoke of fire refining and wind fanning, the application of civil and martial methods was never recorded in writing. Thus, those without dual cultivation could not believe it. Since Bodhidharma and Jiwu passed away, there have been no monks of both spirit and form perfectly attuned.\n\n**Question:** What is \"gathering with martial fire\"?\n**Answer:** Gathering with martial fire means using the qi of inhalation and exhalation to gather the true qi and return it to the source, yet it cannot be separated from the true intention as the master. Thus it is said: \"One intention drives two qi,\" stirring and gathering, all depending on the power of intention. Qi easily arises and flows downward, so it is gathered through breath. Without the stirring of breath’s ebb and flow, even with spirit, gathering is difficult, and qi will not return. The two qi are originally used together. Thus, the Chan master said: \"You have a walking staff, and I give you a pillar\"—this illustrates the mechanism of using the two qi in tandem.\n\nDuring the mechanism of breath, I welcome the qi from the yang heel vessel and return it to the furnace—this is what Bodhidharma called \"gathering.\" Whether ten or dozens of times, when the outer form inverts, one stops. Understanding the ebb and flow of these two qi in opening and closing, the original qi naturally returns to the furnace. When using the two qi, the intention in the furnace does not cling to breath but relies on the original qi for gathering, merely borrowing the mechanism of breath as the tool for gathering—this is what the Sixth Patriarch meant by \"going north to receive and ferry.\"\n\nOnce the original qi has returned to the furnace, it must be refined. Intention serves as fire, breath as wind, smelting the resource of exhausting all leaks until it is entirely transformed into qi. The mind is at ease, the countenance composed—this is the work of martial fire.",

      "translated_text": "Someone asks, \"What is the civil fire?\"\n\nThe answer: The civil fire is neither stored nor guarded, neither stilled nor exhaled. Moment by moment, it remains unwavering, clear and continuous without interruption, each breath returning to the furnace. As an ancient master said, \"The staff comes and goes without cease; the śarīra is perfected and returns to the origin.\" Beware of dullness and distraction—let no thought arise, no intention scatter. Like the fire-seed within the furnace, with such cultivation, how could the true seed fail to grow, the śarīra fail to form, the Great Dao fail to be achieved?\n\nThe Buddha’s tradition records that the World-Honored One attained awakening when facing the Dipper and the bright star. \"Facing\" refers to the Central Flower, known as \"turning the gaze inward.\" The \"Dipper\" is the Northern Dipper, an analogy for the cinnabar field. The \"bright star\" is the radiance of qi emanating from the cinnabar field—precisely the scene where the true seed is born. Thus, Master Xingyang said, \"The red wheel suffuses the earth; beneath the sea, no flower blooms.\" This is it.\n\nMaster Yuantong said, \"Though one hides the body in the Northern Dipper and gains insight, the message of transcending the dust is known by few.\" \"Hiding the body in the Northern Dipper\" means concealing the seed there. If one begins practice elsewhere, one cannot transcend the dust. Those who transcend the dust embody the turning of the Dharma-wheel. If it should turn but does not, the seed is born without return, and all prior effort is wasted—just as Xingyang said, \"To retreat a step is to lose the matter.\" Hence, \"the message of transcending the dust is known by few.\" The above all describes the method of harmonizing the seed.\n\nThe preceding passages reveal the wondrous Dharma of the *Sūtra of the Wisdom-Life* and the celestial mechanism for harmonizing the true seed. The work of wind and fire is no different. This summarizes the method of harmonizing the true seed through wind and fire. The ancient sages refused to disclose it fully, so people found the Great Dao difficult to awaken to, wandering onto side paths. I, in my shallowness, have made it plain to enlighten fellow seekers, that they may not stray into heterodoxy and may swiftly attain right awakening. Those who love the Buddha should quietly devote themselves to this sūtra, cultivating and verifying it themselves to achieve the Great Dao—how joyful that would be!\n\nThus, from the beginning, gather the spirit and turn the light inward to the Dragon Palace, merging into stillness. Await movement with dual forgetting, employing intention and qi in unison, transforming with the spirit-fire, attacking with swift wind, refining with martial fire, and guarding with civil fire. Over time, with ceaseless steaming, intention and qi never part, and the method of harmonious coalescence is attained.\n\nThis summarizes the method of harmonizing the generated true seed. The \"Dragon Palace\" follows the Buddha’s Sanskrit term; in this land, it is called the cinnabar field. Within the cinnabar field lies water, hence the name \"Dragon Palace.\" The nature of water is heavy and sinks, flowing downward day by day. Spirit is fire. The nature of fire is light and rises, flaming upward moment by moment. Ordinary people sink downward and float upward, the two separating and scattering, so they cannot achieve the Dao. The Buddhas and patriarchs congeal fire within water, so the mind becomes empty and fire does not flame upward. Water, heated by fire, no longer flows downward but transforms into qi, which naturally ascends.\n\nWhen gathering the spirit, inner thoughts do not emerge, and outer thoughts do not enter. Vast and empty, unattached and unobstructed, turn the light inward to illuminate. Once illuminated, forget form and intention. To use intention is not to forget; to forget is to be unable to illuminate with intention. \"Mind without absence\" is called illumination; \"desire without annihilation\" is called will. Forgetting and illumination are one yet two, two yet one. When forgetting, the mind is serene yet never fails to illuminate. When illuminating, not a thread stands—never failing to forget. Forgetting and illumination become pure and unified, merging into stillness. Heaven and earth enter me, yet I know not where. Awaiting movement, unaware, warmth and harmony arise, and the outer form stirs. With intention, welcome the qi and return it. Once returned to its origin, fix the spirit within. Use breath to blow and exhale. Over time, with civil fire, neither forgetting nor forcing, in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, never depart from this. How could the true seed fail to be born?\n\nHave you not heard the words of the ancient Daoist who attained the Way? \"In the indistinct, yin and yang first transform; in the misty, heaven and earth begin to revolve.\" The ancient Daoist here is Shao Kangjie. Some in your Buddhist tradition, ignorant and unlearned, claim that Confucians do not know the Great Dao. They strike the seven meditation postures, recite the three verbal mantras, and call it attainment—how laughable! Not only do Confucians hear but not see, but even eminent monks pinch their noses in disgust.\n\n\"Indistinct\" refers to the midst of stillness and concentration, a single undifferentiated mass. Outwardly, one does not see the body; inwardly, one does not see the mind—vague and indistinct. \"First transform\" means that within this indistinctness, suddenly and unaware, warmth and harmony arise, as if bathing. Thus, Master Jiwu said, \"The six directions share spring.\" \"Begin\" is what Master Xingyang called \"the red wheel suffuses the earth.\" \"Revolve\" is the true qi stirring, precisely the moment when the original pass opens and the true seed is born—bringing boundless wondrous joy.\n\nThe *Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch* says, \"The fruit returns to grow in the ground.\" \"Ground\" is called the Pure Land, also the Sea of Suffering, or *udāna*—clever metaphors with different names, all referring to where the fruit grows. \"The fruit returns to grow\" means that only when the mechanism of harmonizing the seed, previously planted by sentient beings with clear awareness, reaches this point does the fruit appear—this is the bodhi seed, also called the śarīra seed.\n\n\"The sun of the Tathāgata of Infinite Light shines clearly; in movement and stillness, it responds without form. Unaware, the Dragon Palace roars.\" \"Without form\" is what Śākyamuni called \"from the beginning,\" and what Confucians call \"the Limitless.\" This thing is originally formless, born from stillness and concentration.",

      "translated_text": "The Dragon Palace refers to the \"ground\" mentioned earlier. The \"roar\" signifies the \"fruit's growth\" as described above. The Confucians say, \"The cuckoo’s cry heralds spring’s dawn,\" which is the birth of yang qi. To grasp the mechanism of this single roar is to make flowing waters course, to draw in the West River, to pour the sea’s waters over the crown of the head. An ancient master said, \"The earth’s thunder shakes, and the Xun Gate opens.\" Another said, \"The thunder’s beauty resounds from the ground.\" The sun of the Vajra-Garbha Golden Light Tathāgata shines—from the sea’s depths, the mud ox reveals half its horn. The \"sea’s depths\" are one’s own cinnabar field, the Northern Sea. The World-Honored One calls it the Dragon Palace, or the Ganges. Master Xingyang also refers to it as the sea’s depths, the hidden source of the life of wisdom, hence called the \"sea.\" The \"mud ox\" is this life of wisdom; the World-Honored One calls it the *maṇi*, the true seed refined from the harmonizing of the spirit and qi within one’s body. \"Revealing half its horn\" is the symbolic manifestation of the true seed’s impending birth. At this moment, one must hold it with stillness and not rush to gather it. Only when the ox reveals its full horn of its own accord may one proceed with the work. Otherwise, if thoughts stir and startle the ox, it will retreat and vanish without a trace.\n\nMaster Yuantong said, \"One must wait for the primordial aperture to generate the thing; only then can the yang furnace ignite. Do not precede it, nor follow it too late—this is called being born too early.\" Thus, Master Jiwu said, \"If the mechanism has not yet arrived and one forcibly hastens it, the external fire may proceed, but the internal tally will not respond. This only invites the calamity of self-immolation—how could it be permissible?\" Master Yuantong also said, \"If the plum blossom has not bloomed, it is born too early; if it has already bloomed, it is born too late.\" The \"plum blossom\" is the Dao of yang, the harbinger of spring’s message—an analogy for the scene of yang qi arising within the body. \"Not yet bloomed\" signifies yang on the verge of stirring but not yet moved. If one rashly gathers it at this time, the qi is too tender and will not ascend, hence \"born too early.\" \"Already bloomed\" signifies yang qi already in motion. At this time, one must return it to the source. If it is not returned, the qi disperses and loses its foundation, hence \"born too late.\" Master Yuanyu said, \"Advance a step and lose the principle; retreat a step and fail in the task.\" Truly, this is the case. He also said, \"Thus, the frost and wind are wholly spent, and spring is uniquely possessed throughout the heavens.\" \"Thus\" refers to the present moment. \"Frost and wind spent\" signifies the absence of yin qi. \"Spring\" is yang, an analogy for the cinnabar field’s pure yang qi. Within it, the scene is like bathing, the entire body harmonized and blissful beyond compare. Inside and out, all is yang spring—the true scene of the true seed’s birth.\n\nHe further said, \"One must urgently steal it.\" This is the ancestral master’s admonition to later generations: if one sees this scene arise, one must immediately proceed to gather it. If one does not gather it, one misses it face-to-face, and the thing returns along its familiar path. Thus, Master Xingyang said, \"To retreat is to fail in the task.\" His words are true—how could one not awaken? Hence, it is called \"stealing.\" \"Stealing\" means forceful seizure. At this time, one must be fiercely courageous, mastering it with one’s intent, gathering it with one’s breath, returning this true seed to the elixir furnace, and only then applying the work of the Dharma wheel.\n\nMaster Jiwu said, \"When the six directions share spring, all things find their place.\" \"Six directions sharing\" refers to the entire body; \"spring\" is an analogy for the warmth suffusing the body. \"Things\" is a Buddhist term, corresponding to the Confucian *yuanqi*. When the work reaches its appointed time and this thing is about to be born, one becomes unaware, and suddenly the cinnabar field is warm and harmonious, the entire body soft and blissful, spring arising in every pore. Body and mind are without mastery, the cinnabar field warm and melting, gradually ascending. The yang organ stirs vigorously, and suddenly a roar erupts, breath abruptly ceasing. Heart and thing cling like magnets, intent and breath embrace like hibernating insects. Unawares, one enters a state of vagueness—heaven, earth, self, and others are nowhere to be found. All is merged and boundless, yet this is not the dry emptiness of today’s Chan practitioners. Within this vagueness, the heart refuses to abandon the thing, and the thing refuses to leave the heart. They are intimate and inseparable, entwined as one. Within this scene, it seems to open and close, yet no opening or closing is truly seen; it seems to leak and spill, yet no leakage or spillage occurs. Its wonder cannot be described in words.\n\nThus, the *Heart Sūtra* commentary says, \"The first stirring of yang holds boundless messages.\" Soon after, in a state of vagueness, the heart regains its numinosity, breath resumes, and the qi of the cinnabar field moves from below to behind, along the root of the kidney channel, between the pubic hair. The pleasure of nurturing life cannot be restrained—this is what is meant by \"when qi fills, the Ren and Du meridians open of themselves.\" Swiftly gather it and return it to the source, turning the great Dharma wheel. Otherwise, if this thing overflows, all previous efforts will be wasted.\n\nThis entire passage fully reveals the celestial mechanism. I obtained this wondrous Dao only after more than thirty years. Later cultivators, when your practice reaches this point, take heed, take heed! Do not overlook the scenes within. If you attain two or three of them, it is the birth of the true seed. One need not rigidly adhere to this, for physical constitutions vary. Bodhidharma said, \"In the second stage, gather the *maṇi*.\" This refers to the stage of gathering the thing and returning it to the furnace. \"Second stage\" means the first stage is when the living yang arises, and the second stage is when yang accumulates to fullness and the true seed is born. \"Gathering\" means that when this thing is born, it still follows its familiar path, descending and leaking. Thus, one uses breath to gather it and return it to the furnace.",
      "overlap_context": "rmonizing the seed, previously planted by sentient beings with clear awareness, reaches this point does the fruit appear—this is the bodhi seed, also called the śarīra seed.\n\n\"The sun of the Tathāgata of Infinite Light shines clearly; in movement and stillness, it responds without form. Unaware, the Dragon Palace roars.\" \"Without form\" is what Śākyamuni called \"from the beginning,\" and what Confucians call \"the Limitless.\" This thing is originally formless, born from stillness and concentration.",

      "translated_text": "The term *maṇi* is another name for this thing, which the Confucians call *primordial qi*. It is also said: \"In the second stage, gather the *maṇi*; in the fourth stage, there are wondrous functions; in the sixth stage, there are distinct spiritual powers.\" The aforementioned \"second stage\" refers to the stages of birth and production. This \"second stage\" here encompasses the two stages of gathering and sealing. Those who study Buddhism must pay close attention and not treat them as one and the same. By examining the *Six Stages of the Dharma Wheel* diagram, it becomes clear. This \"second stage\" refers to the moment when the true seed is produced: gathering it and returning it to the furnace is one stage, and sealing it within the furnace is another, hence the two stages. Once returned to the furnace, one should swiftly raise and lower the *maṇi* to turn the Dharma Wheel and form the *śarīra*. Rising is one stage, descending is another, and bathing constitutes two stages—altogether four stages, hence \"in the fourth stage, there are wondrous functions.\" Gathering, sealing, rising, descending, and bathing together make six stages, hence \"in the sixth stage, there are distinct spiritual powers.\" Returning to the root and nurturing the *śarīra* requires no further action.\n\nThe Sixth Patriarch said, \"Go north to receive and ferry.\" \"Go\" means directing the mind; \"north\" refers to the *dantian*; \"receive\" means using the mind to grasp the thing; \"ferry\" refers to the rising and descending movements. Master Jiwu of the Chan school said, \"Gather and raise, then descend: ascend along the *Du Mai* to the *niwan*, and descend along the *Ren Mai* to the *dantian*.\" The *Ren* and *Du* meridians are the pathways through which the Dharma Wheel circulates. The *Ren Mai* begins at the front arc of the *dantian*, winds through the abdomen, passes through the throat, and ascends to the crown. The *Du Mai* starts at the rear arc of the *dantian*, runs alongside the spine to the *fengfu*, enters the brain, and converges with the *Ren Mai*. When these two meridians are unobstructed, all the meridians become free. Gathering proceeds along this path, the Dharma Wheel turns along this path, and those who recognize this path will form the *śarīra* along it.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Closing the door is called *Kun*; opening the door is called *Qian*. One closing and one opening is called *change*; ceaseless coming and going is called *communication*.\" This describes the workings of the Dharma Wheel through the two *qi*. Moreover, among the scriptures of Buddhist cultivation, those revered by past masters—such as the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* and the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*—are considered foremost. Among the scriptures of Confucian cultivation, none surpass the *Book of Changes*. The abbot of Taiyi Haihui Monastery, Longjiang, asked: \"In the Sanskrit texts of the Western regions, I have never seen mention of the *Book of Changes*. Why include it here, as it does not align with Buddhist teachings?\" I replied: \"To cling to one and remain ignorant of the other—what you practice is merely a side door. The Dao of the ancient sages has never been glimpsed by those a thousand generations before or after. This person, this mind—how could the Three Teachings have two different Ways? You fail to see that the source of the *Book of Changes* is the origin of the Dao itself.\"\n\nHe asked: \"If this is a Daoist text, why do contemporary Confucian scholars treat the *Book of Changes* as a manual for examination essays and divination, rather than for cultivation?\" I replied: \"Examination essays and divination are the pursuits of worldly Confucians, not those who transcend the mundane. The greatest Confucians of antiquity explored the principles of the *prior-heaven*, investigated the mechanisms of opening and closing, probed the roots of things, and mastered *xing* and *ming* within themselves, independent of external creation. They embodied the celestial principle, standing apart from the multitude—hence they are called Confucians.\"\n\nHe asked: \"What is the practice of the Dao?\" I replied: \"The Dao operates through the *prior-heaven*, borrowing the claws and planks of the *posterior-heaven* to turn the Dharma Wheel. Closing the door is the mechanism of inhalation—inhale, and it descends, hence *Kun*. Opening the door is the mechanism of exhalation—exhale, and it ascends, hence *Qian*. This is the principle of the *posterior-heaven*.\"",

      "translated_text": "Transformation is the waxing and waning of the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams, akin to driving a chariot. *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the wheels, while transformation acts as the axle. The chariot cannot move on its own; it relies on the axle at both ends, and the axle in turn depends on the wheels at both ends. The wheels, moreover, depend on the opening and closing of inhalation and exhalation to propel them. The chariot turns by means of the axle and rotates by means of the wheels, while the wheels are driven by the impetus of opening and closing—only then is its function complete.\n\nShould this remain unclear, further study of the Six Signs Diagram will reveal its profound subtleties. The inexhaustible coming and going is the mechanism by which the *qi* of *prior-heaven* and *posterior-heaven* circulate and transform. \"Permeation\" refers to the pivotal mechanism by which the *prior-heaven* and *posterior-heaven* operate in unison, penetrating the primordial pass.\n\nTo equate the ceaseless alternation of a single inhalation and exhalation through the nose and mouth with this inexhaustible coming and going is to stray far from the great Dao of *prior-heaven*.\n\nHe asked: \"What then should one do?\"\nI replied: \"Employ the breath of *posterior-heaven* to activate the breath of *prior-heaven*. The exhalation mechanism is opening and *Qian*; the inhalation mechanism is closing and *Kun*. *Qian* and *Kun* are the fixed positions of Heaven and Earth. In the human body, the head is *Qian*, and the abdomen is *Kun*. Transformation is the master within *Qian* and *Kun*—it is one’s true intention, which sets the mechanism of the two *qi* in motion.\n\nIt is like the Northern and Southern Dipper stars: their ceaseless coming and going is the circulation of the two *qi*. You come as I go, I go as you come—like the shuttle of a villager weaving cloth. You rise as I descend, I descend as you rise—hence the inexhaustibility.\n\nYet while this is so, one must not place equal emphasis on *prior-heaven* and *posterior-heaven* simultaneously. During the phases of ascent and descent, though intention governs the Dipper’s pivot, the spirit must prioritize alignment with *prior-heaven*, merely borrowing the opening and closing mechanism of *posterior-heaven* to mobilize the *prior-heaven*.\n\nHe further asked: \"This disciple is dull-witted and begs for the key principle, lest I presume to practice on my own and commit the error of disclosure.\"\nI replied: \"The World-Honored One said, ‘Only when all beings are liberated does one liberate oneself.’ How could this be an error? Moreover, in the present age of the Buddhist teaching, is there no such dual cultivation?\"\nI answered: \"This is the secret mechanism of turning the Dharma Wheel. The sages of *Qian* did not dare speak of it plainly; the myriad patriarchs did not dare point it out directly. It is subtler than the subtlest, more refined than the most refined. Though laypeople may hear of it, only those with prior karmic blessings may encounter it.\"\n\nHe pleaded: \"This disciple earnestly begs the master to bestow grace.\"\nI replied: \"Though inhalation is the closing of *Kun* below, the primordial *qi* of *Kun*’s abdomen passes through me and ascends. To ascend is to rise to *Qian*. Though exhalation is the opening of *Qian* above, the primordial *qi* of *Qian*’s head passes through me and descends. To descend is to fall to *Kun*. Altogether, this is the ascent and descent of the two *qi*—*prior* and *posterior*—along three pathways: front, back, and center. Together, they form the wheel and axle of *Qian* and *Kun*, communicating the subtle movements of the primordial pass. The master is intention; the agent of circulation is spirit.\n\nWith each inhalation, there is an ascent; with each exhalation, a descent—no deviation by even a hair’s breadth. Follow the prescribed path, counting the steps without falling short or exceeding the measure. *Qian* is nine, *Kun* is six; four manipulations complete the pattern. In harmony with creation, in accord with the wheel’s turning, neither biased nor imbalanced, precisely aligned—no matter the disputes among teachings, those who attain the Dao do not depart from this method.\n\nIt is further said: '*Qian*’s line employs nine; *Kun*’s line employs six.' This refers to the numerical rules and limits governing the turning of the Dharma Wheel’s mechanism. *Qian* employs nine: four nines make thirty-six, and each of the three cycles in the first, second, and third rounds uses four manipulations. *Kun* employs six: four sixes make twenty-four, and each of the three cycles in the first, second, and third rounds likewise uses four manipulations.\n\nIn ancient times, the first through sixth rounds were designated for ascent, aligning with *Qian*. Thus, *Qian*’s lines and *Qian*’s counts were used: *Qian*’s line employs nine, and four manipulations yield thirty-six. Therefore, the ascent of the Dharma Wheel also employs nine, corresponding to the four manipulations. The total count for *Qian*’s six lines, each manipulated four times, is two hundred sixteen—hence the six rounds of ascent also total two hundred sixteen.\n\nThe first through sixth rounds were designated for descent, aligning with *Kun*. Thus, *Kun*’s lines and *Kun*’s counts were used: *Kun*’s line employs six, and four manipulations yield twenty-four. Therefore, the descent of the Dharma Wheel also employs six, corresponding to the four manipulations. The total count for *Kun*’s six lines, each manipulated four times, is one hundred forty-four—hence the six rounds of descent also total one hundred forty-four.\n\nCombined, they yield three hundred sixty, completing one full cycle of the Dharma Wheel’s numerical progression. Yet within this, there are two rounds of purification that do not employ the nine-six-four manipulations, leaving the total short of three hundred sixty. The earlier reference to 'three hundred sixty' implies that the sixty omitted from the purification rounds are already accounted for within it.\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: 'All Buddhas, in samādhi, turn the wondrous Dharma Wheel in perfect timing.' This is an analogy for the two rounds of purification. 'In samādhi, in perfect timing' refers to the two boundary states of purification. The Confucians call them the *mao* and *you* hours; the Buddhists likewise refer to them as such. If not for these designated times, why would it be called 'perfect timing'? 'Samādhi' means that during these two hours, one does not engage in inhalation or exhalation.

      "translated_text": "The Dao is a path—specifically, the Conception and Governing Vessels. \"Neither too slow nor too swift\" means regulating the method through breath. \"Examining with careful discernment and walking the path\" signifies that whenever the Dharma Wheel is turned, spirit and qi must move and abide together. If one wanders aimlessly outside the Dao, drifting in vagueness without following its course, one cannot form the śarīra. The Tathāgata said: \"Neither exert too much nor too little.\" Turning the Dharma Wheel must accord with nature and align with the Great Dao. If one is overzealous, excess wind arises, the Dharma Wheel cannot circulate, and the flame loses control. If one is negligent, the wind is too weak, failing to cultivate vigorous progress, and transformation cannot occur.\n\nDīpaṃkara Buddha said: \"Constantly turn the Dharma Wheel.\" The Dharma Wheel is a Sanskrit term from the Western Regions; in this land, it is called \"ascent and descent,\" \"advance and retreat\"—the true seed returning to its source. \"Constantly\" means that whenever the true seed is produced, it must complete one full cycle. If it does not circulate, the leakage cannot be stopped, and the śarīra will not form. Yet one must not turn it without rest; though no great harm comes of it, the moment of production will be delayed. The World-Honored One said: \"One should turn such a wondrous Dharma Wheel.\" As for \"wondrous,\" it cannot be described in words—hence it is called \"wondrous.\" But if there are no words, how can later students awaken to it? This depends on whether one has a teacher or not. The Great Dao is most secret—who would dare reveal it entirely? Seeing that there are no dual-cultivation practitioners in the world, I point out these truths to guide learners toward mastery. The wondrous lies in the ebb and flow: those who understand find it most simple and easy; those who do not find it truly difficult and arduous.\n\nConsider the self-sounding clock—it is the Dharma Wheel. The workings of heaven and earth are all contained within it. Country folk who have never seen a clock know only water pestles and water mills, yet the principle is the same. Someone asked: \"How does the clock compare to the pestle and mill in relation to the Dao?\" I answered: \"The clock’s hammer represents breath; the wheels inside represent primordial qi. The water that drives the mill is like breath, and what turns it is like primordial qi. Though the mechanism of the pestle and mill resembles the method, it is not entirely complete. Why is the self-sounding clock said to embody the full function of the Great Dao? The pestle and mill show only advancement, not retreat. The wheels inside the clock turn forward for advancement, but when they reach their limit, they reverse—this reversal is retreat.\"\n\nThe Sixth Patriarch said: \"I have one thing that supports heaven above and earth below.\" That \"thing\" is what the Confucians call primordial qi. \"Supports heaven\" means ascending to the crown; \"supports earth\" means descending to the abdomen. The *Buddhist Records* say: \"The seawater anoints the crown of the Prince.\" The \"sea\" is the cinnabar field; \"water\" is primordial qi. In Buddhist metaphors, it is called \"Creek Water,\" \"the cave stream flowing backward,\" or \"one gulp drinking the entire West River.\" \"Anointing the crown\" is ascent. The \"Prince\" is the Tathāgata.\n\nThe World-Honored One said: \"After cremation, gather the śarīra.\" This refers to the moment when the śarīra is about to form. \"Fire\" is spirit. The śarīra is fully achieved through the power of fire. Yet when it forms, there must be tangible effects—it is not empty or insensate. When the śarīra is about to form, the empty chamber grows bright, the cinnabar field boils like hot soup, and the turtle withdraws, no longer rising. Then one applies the method of gathering, moving it past the three barriers behind the spine and returning it to the central palace to nourish the Dao-embryo—hence the act of retrieval.\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: \"Possessing the form of a man, perfecting the Tathāgata’s hidden horse-phallus sign.\" The \"hidden horse-phallus\" means the turtle becomes thread-like. Only when it withdraws and does not rise is the śarīra successfully formed. If there is even slight movement, one must not consider it complete. The Dharma Wheel must further refine it. Without forging, the qi is tender and weak, unable to break through the barriers. One must wait for the sign of breakthrough before moving it. Once the sign appears, the Dharma Wheel should stop. If one recklessly continues, the śarīra, though formed, will be forced by fire to leak, and one remains an ordinary person.\n\nSome—whether old or ill—whose external kidneys do not rise may mistake this for the formation of the śarīra, but this is incorrect. It lacks the foundation of leakage cessation; one must cultivate further until there is movement before success can be expected. The World-Honored One said: \"The Arhat who does not die.\" \"Does not die\" means longevity. If the external kidney does not rise and the śarīra is formed, this is why one does not die. For example, the Buddha’s disciple Mahākāśyapa lived for seven hundred years. Later, he met the World-Honored One, who transmitted the method of passing the barriers, and he became the Second Patriarch. The Venerable Baozhang lived for 1,712 years. Later, he met Bodhidharma, who transmitted the method of passing the barriers, and only then did he transcend. This is because he had attained the śarīra but had not yet realized the Dao-embryo, so he remained in the world.\n\nAll the above describes the work of turning the Dharma Wheel to form the śarīra—is not the path of wisdom-life entirely contained herein? This summarizes the method of forming the śarīra.\n\nI say: The Dao of forming the śarīra involves many techniques—true spirit, true qi, true intent, breath, mastery, and circulation—too numerous to record in full. When turning the Dharma Wheel in practice, one must single-mindedly gather the two qi and apply the method of circulation, ensuring that spirit harmonizes with true qi and follows the same path. One must not be distracted by other perceptions. Within the twelve regulations, breath drives the circulation, and the rhythm of respiration determines the method. From gathering to returning to the root, one must not depart from it even for a moment. Departure breaks the continuity, and the śarīra will not form.\n\nThough the Dao of forming the śarīra involves many techniques, it is ultimately the simplest and easiest method.",

      "translated_text": "At first, the practice seems difficult, but with familiarity, it becomes easy. It is like a villager weaving at the loom: hands, feet, head, and eyes must coordinate in all directions. For a beginner, this is most challenging, yet once mastered, the weaver moves without conscious effort—hands, feet, head, and eyes working in perfect harmony, as if governed by some natural mechanism. If one clings to rigid control, the weaving cannot be accomplished. The Great Dao operates in the same way. When turning the Dharma Wheel, intent resides in the elixir field as the wheel’s hub, heart-spirit moves qi as the wheel’s teeth, and breath propels it as the wheel’s axle—all unfolding through that same natural mechanism. What difficulty could there be?\n\nTo avoid distraction, when turning the Dharma Wheel, one must shut out external senses and silence internal thoughts. A single point of true spirit guides the qi in its cycle; the slightest stray thought scatters it through collateral meridians, rendering the effort futile. As for the numbers: each step involves four divinations. Rising becomes yang, yang is *qian*, and *qian* uses nine—four nines make thirty-six. *Qian*’s total for six lines of four divinations each is two hundred sixteen. Descending becomes yin, yin is *kun*, and *kun* uses six—four sixes make twenty-four. *Kun*’s total for six lines of four divinations each is one hundred forty-four. Combined, they form the three hundred sixty numbers, completing the Dharma Wheel’s path—its steps measured with flawless precision. How wondrous! How perfect! This is the Dao. Without this method, nothing can be achieved.\n\nFrom the Han dynasty to the present, this has been kept secret, passed down in confidentiality from Buddha to Buddha, from patriarch to patriarch. I now reveal it in full, hoping that those with aspiration may soon attain the Great Dao. The three hundred sixty numbers are not literally three hundred sixty; they are a metaphor. The wheel has twenty-four teeth, and with each full rotation—front and back—it completes forty-eight, called one revolution of the Dharma Wheel. The wheel’s outer rim thus forms the three hundred sixty numbers, with no discrepancy. Hence, it is called the three hundred sixty numbers.\n\nHave you not heard the words of the World-Honored One to Mahākāśyapa? He spoke of the *True Dharma Eye Treasury*. This is the secret celestial mechanism for obtaining śarīra—hence, the *True Dharma*. The eye is where spirit dwells; where the eye goes, spirit follows. He also said to Ānanda: \"If you do not know where the heart and eyes reside, you cannot subdue the dust and toil.\" This is the sublime principle of the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the hidden mechanism for obtaining śarīra. Without using the heart and eyes to gather it, the śarīra cannot emerge from the furnace. Thus, the *True Dharma Eye Treasury* mentioned above—those who can fathom it truly possess something extraordinary.\n\nAfter three to five days, the elixir field gradually warms, coalescing into a *maṇi* that takes the form of a fire pearl. Signs of efficacy appear in succession, and the wondrous realms are beyond compare. During the gathering phase, one must focus intently, never straying for even a moment. If one strays, the fire cools, the qi disperses, and the *maṇi* will not form. Thus, the seven days of contemplation must not be taken lightly! If one abandons this method for another, the śarīra will never be obtained—at best, one may achieve longevity.\n\nThe *Lotus Sūtra* states: \"I now pledge to uphold this matter for you; it shall not be in vain. You must diligently apply your mind and advance with vigor, practicing this samādhi for seven days, contemplating this matter.\" \"This matter\" is a Buddhist term, equivalent to what the Confucians call true qi. When qi is refined through the wind-and-fire method into śarīra, it is said to be \"not in vain.\" Day and night, without rest, one must hold this single thought—hence, \"diligently apply your mind and advance with vigor.\" All other concerns must be emptied, and the single luminous point of spirit must fix its gaze upon the śarīra—hence, \"contemplating this matter.\" The seven days are the master key to gathering śarīra, corresponding to what the Confucians call \"after seven days, one again perceives the heart of Heaven and Earth,\" or \"after seven days, yang returns.\" The time for gathering may vary—some obtain it in five days, others in six—there is no fixed rule.\n\nThe World-Honored One spoke of the *Six Kinds of Tremors*. This describes the phenomena accompanying the birth of śarīra. The \"six kinds\" refer to six places within the body, not the six directions of the world. The eyes emit golden light, the ears hear the sound of wind, the nose experiences a tugging of qi, behind the brain a vulture’s cry is heard, the body leaps and moves, and in the elixir field, a fire pearl dashes about—these are the six kinds of tremor. He also said: \"Between the eyebrows, a white ray of light constantly shines.\" When the śarīra is fully formed, in complete darkness, one may see this white light—neither too much nor too little. At this moment, gather it, and it will be obtained. This is the marvelous function of the Buddha-Dao.\n\nAs the śarīra prepares to emerge from the furnace, from the elixir field to the eyes, the entire path shimmers with an empty, radiant whiteness, bright as moonlight. If, before this clarity is achieved, the external kidneys do not retract—assuming the form of the *Hidden Horse Yin*—any light that appears is but an illusion born of false imagination, not the light of śarīra. The World-Honored One said: \"The reed sprout pierces the knee.\" The \"reed sprout\" is a clever metaphor for the qi refined in the elixir field—called śarīra, or *bodhi*, or bright pearl, though its names are many; it is nothing other than this qi. \"Pierces\" refers to passing through the three rear barriers. If one uses intent to force the passage, it becomes mere guided exercise—a side door. If one does not use intent, the timing is lost. Neither approach can succeed. Between not guiding and not losing lies the celestial mechanism, which must be transmitted by a teacher. Who would dare reveal it recklessly? This is the most secret and essential teaching of a thousand Buddhas and ten thousand patriarchs. One must earnestly seek a teacher to have any hope of attaining it.\n\nBodhidharma said: \"Crossing the river by breaking a reed.\"",

      "translated_text": "Here the masterful metaphor for passing the barriers—how could ordinary monks, never having received the true transmission, presume that the patriarch merely \"broke a reed to cross the river,\" even claiming he did so beneath Bear Ear Mountain? Absurd! If one cannot cross the sea, how could one cross a river?\n\nNow the patriarch was born in Southern India. Having attained the Dharma, he wished to journey east. The king provided a great ship laden with treasures, and after three years at sea, he landed in Guangzhou. First he met with Liang, but found no affinity. Later he joined with Wei, and there accomplished the great matter.\n\n\"Breaking\" means to seek; \"reed\" is śarīra; \"crossing\" is circulation; \"river\" is the pathway of free movement. The World-Honored One said: \"An arrow pierces nine layers of iron drums.\" The \"arrow\" is true qi; \"shooting\" is the method of spirit and qi moving in unison. The \"nine layers\" refer to the three barriers in the human spine—Weilü, Jiaji, and Yuzhen. Each barrier has openings on both left and right, hence \"nine layers.\" The wondrous method of passing the barriers must proceed through the central aperture; if one races along another path, the Way cannot be attained.\n\nIt is also said: \"Dhyāna-bliss is food.\" Now \"dhyāna-bliss\" is the realm of joy; \"food\" is a metaphor for consuming śarīra, not ordinary eating. When true qi ascends to the crown, enters the throat, and returns to the Central Palace, this is called \"eating.\" Before consuming it, there are perilous paths to traverse—one must guard against leakage of śarīra. Thus the lower throat aperture is solid, while the nasal aperture is empty. If solid, it does not move; if empty, it leaks. Without a teacher’s personal instruction in forming śarīra, one cannot master the method of guiding the \"ox through the nose.\" To recklessly race through the empty aperture, exhausting a thousand hardships to obtain śarīra, only to waste it all—how grievous!\n\nIt is also said: \"Dharma-joy fills to the full.\" \"Dharma-joy\" is spring—true qi. Once this qi returns to the Central Palace, one gradually ceases to eat. Hence it is called \"filling to the full.\" Some go three months without eating, others four. Those with concentrated power achieve fasting quickly; those with scattered power achieve it slowly. Yet \"fasting\" is not forced—when qi is full and spirit settled, one naturally ceases to eat.\n\nThe *Sūtra of the Buddha’s Former Deeds* says: \"When reaching the southern bank of the Ganges, abide in stability as steady as Mount Sumeru.\" \"Water\" is a clever metaphor in Sanskrit for the refined śarīra. The \"southern bank\" is the Central Palace. Once śarīra returns to the Central Palace, spirit and qi cling like magnet to iron, never parting. Once attained, it is eternally attained—no wandering, no restlessness. Secure and at ease, this is what the Confucians call \"holding fast to the center.\" As deluded consciousness gradually dissolves, true nature gradually awakens. False thoughts vanish; right mindfulness remains. This is what the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* means by \"sitting quietly in a still room, ever dwelling in this thought.\"\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"Practice in accord with the Buddha, receiving a portion of the Buddha’s qi. Like the intermediate state seeking parents, yin and yang mysteriously connect. One enters the lineage of the Tathāgata, called the ‘Noble Birth Abode.’\"\n\nNow \"practice\" does not mean walking or acting—it is the inner work of cultivating the Dao-embryo. Once śarīra returns to the Central Palace, spirit receives this Buddha. Qi is restrained, not wandering; spirit attains stability through qi, qi attains dwelling through spirit. Intimately entwined, they melt and merge into one—this is \"practicing in accord with the Buddha, receiving a portion of the Buddha’s qi.\" Nature belongs to yin—hence the \"yin body.\" The Buddha’s qi is the father; breath is the mother. At this stage, one must not fall into barren stillness. The Buddha’s qi has the principle of vitality; breath has the mechanism of nourishment. One must use nature to seek the complement of these two qi. When the Buddha’s qi arises, guide it back to the source to assist the perfection of the embryo. Breath, ceaseless and subtle, is directed to nourish the embryo’s transformation. This is \"seeking parents on one’s own.\"\n\nYet one must not cling to one and lose the other. At this point, a qi from the great emptiness arrives from the Hall of Light to the Central Palace. I then activate the opening and closing, causing it to circulate throughout the body, expelling all yin qi and transforming it into a purely yang body. The 360 joints and 84,000 pores—none are not penetrated. This is \"yin and yang mysteriously connecting.\" The ordinary body is forgotten; the Dao-embryo remains. A single expanse of celestial, true Buddha-body—this is the \"lineage of the Tathāgata.\" Though dwelling in the Dao-embryo, it is formless and imageless, perfect in samādhi and wisdom—this is the \"Noble Birth Abode.\"\n\nThe World-Honored One said: \"Between the realms of desire and form, he manifests a jeweled hall like a trichiliocosm, expounding the profound Buddha-dharma, that the Dharma may long abide.\"\n\n\"Desire\" and \"form\" are Sanskrit terms from the West; in China they are called the lower and middle elixir fields. Thus the *Śamatha-Vipaśyanā* says: \"In the West, *udāna*; in this land, elixir field.\" \"Manifesting\" is the wondrous function of spirit—the method of nourishing the pathway. Though residing in the middle field, one must combine it with the lower field to transform them into a single empty realm. If spirit clings to the middle field, the Dao-embryo becomes obstructed, and it is no longer a jeweled hall.\n\nThe \"three thousand\" refers to the upper, middle, and lower elixir fields. Common monks mistakenly claim it means the past thousand, present thousand, and future thousand—how absurd! When refining śarīra, one works in the lower field—this is called \"a thousand teachings.\" Yet it must circulate through the upper and middle fields. When nourishing the Dao-embryo, one resides in the middle field for ten months—hence \"that the Dharma may long abide,\" also called \"a thousand teachings.\" Yet it must pass through the upper and lower fields before emerging from samādhi. The upper field is also called \"a thousand teachings.\"",
      "overlap_context": " passage, it becomes mere guided exercise—a side door. If one does not use intent, the timing is lost. Neither approach can succeed. Between not guiding and not losing lies the celestial mechanism, which must be transmitted by a teacher. Who would dare reveal it recklessly? This is the most secret and essential teaching of a thousand Buddhas and ten thousand patriarchs. One must earnestly seek a teacher to have any hope of attaining it.\n\nBodhidharma said: \"Crossing the river by breaking a reed.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is called the \"three thousand.\" The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: \"Through samādhi, the mind is subdued, ultimately leaving no remainder.\"\n\nNow, samādhi is not the rigid sitting of withered meditation, nor is it the forced suppression of dull emptiness—it is a natural state of stillness. When the *śarīra* returns to the central palace, consciousness dies and true nature awakens, filling one with Dharma joy and Chan bliss, a wondrous and serene delight. Without inside or outside, it coalesces into a single mass—this samādhi is beyond comparison with that of ordinary monks. Radiant as the autumn moon, harmonious in nature; warm as if intoxicated, life suffused with fragrance. With inner vision, the *śarīra* steams and permeates, so that flesh and bone are as if bathed, while the mind and nature resemble the vast sky. Realizing the unconditioned, the six senses rest in tranquility; illuminating the eight consciousnesses, the five aggregates are emptied. Though there is the mechanism of circulation, the true nature remains utterly undisturbed.\n\nThe World-Honored One said: \"Coming in accord with principle, going in accord with principle.\" The preceding passage describes the verification of attaining the *śarīra*; this explains the method of practice at the initial entry onto the path. \"Coming and going\" is a metaphor for the breath. It instructs that when cultivating the Dao-embryo, one must rely on the breath, only then can one depart from birth and leave the realm, reaching quiescence. Thus it is said: \"Coming in accord with principle, going in accord with principle.\"\n\nTherefore, a Chan master said:\n*\"Before reaching the end of water and the exhaustion of mountains,*\n*One must pass the time in good company.\"*\n\nFor when a person leaves the mother’s womb, the breath and primordial *qi* all disperse outward. In daily life and constant practice, the elixir field is originally empty. Only when the breath within the embryo is understood, and spirit congeals while *qi* abides, can the *śarīra* be refined and return here. Yet the breath must also return here. Primordial *qi* is the root of forming the embryo; breath is the source of nourishing the path. One must also know to use the mind to govern and stabilize the breath. Before the breath is stabilized, the mind regulates it. If the breath is not regulated, it will not stabilize, and the Dao cannot be realized.\n\nAt the initial entry into the embryo, how can the method of regulating the breath be lacking? \"Coming in accord with principle, going in accord with principle\"—this is the meaning of regulating the breath. This is what was imparted to the great bodhisattvas:\n*\"Why did the six years on Snow Mountain come to pass?*\n*With resolve firm, harmonizing *qi* and spirit,*\n*In a hundred moments, all becomes one breath—*\n*Only then does the great Dao manifest the Three Vehicles.\"*\n\nThe Tathāgata spoke of \"the *nirvāṇa* with remainder.\" \"Remainder\" refers to the remaining breath. When first entering the Dao-embryo, the mind relies on the breath, and the breath follows the mind—neither hurried nor sluggish, allowing it to flow naturally. Yet one must not let it drift into dissipation or disorder, oblivious to the true breath within. The embryo originally possesses breath, and though it may seem as if there is no breath, it is not truly absent but actually present.\n\nThus, the *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* explains:\n*\"Who knows who arranges it by force?*\n*Gathered together, then released again.*\n*Do not say the Tathāgata has attained extinction—*\n*One sound follows another in succession.\"*\nThis is the meaning of the mind and breath relying on each other.\n\nThe *Brahmajāla Sūtra* and *Śīla Sūtra* state: \"Abiding in the one truth of *tathatā*, one practices the emptiness of non-arising. All buddhas and sages dwell equally in the emptiness of non-arising.\" \"Abiding in the one truth of *tathatā*\" refers to the mechanism by which primordial *qi* and postnatal breath intermingle and connect, steaming and nourishing the source of the embryo—neither hurried nor sluggish, proceeding in accord with *tathatā*. Nowadays, those who engage in seven-day meditation retreats and call it \"abiding in truth\"—is this not a mistake?\n\nThus, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says:\n*\"The great immortal path of the Tathāgata*\n*Is subtle and wondrous, difficult to know.\"*\nWhen in the state of steaming and blending, spirit and *qi* merge completely, as if bathed or intoxicated, flesh and bone harmonize. Between the realms of desire and form, without attachment or stagnation, empty and open—thus it is called the emptiness of non-arising.\n\nThe World-Honored One said: \"The *tathāgatagarbha* is empty yet not empty.\" The preceding passage speaks of the emptiness of non-arising, yet it also guards against the error of annihilationism. Thus it is said: \"empty yet not empty\"—this is quiescence that is ever-illuminating. \"Not empty\" guards against the error of eternalism—\"not empty yet as if empty\"—this is illumination that is ever-quiescent.\n\nDīpaṃkara Buddha said: \"When arising and ceasing have ceased.\" \"Arising and ceasing have ceased\" means that the breath within the embryo comes to utmost stillness, yet the principle of expansion and contraction still remains—thus it is called \"arising and ceasing.\" One must guard and bring it to the point where no trace of expansion or contraction remains—thus it is called \"have ceased.\" Knowing only spirit and not the *qi* within the embryo is called \"the myriad dharmas return to the One.\" The method of realizing the mind must rely on the embryo to abide. What is meant by \"returning to the Dharma\" is returning to this.\n\nWithout the Dao-embryo *śarīra* and the true primordial *qi*, forcibly abiding the mind and calling it \"have ceased\" is delusion for those who claim to realize the Dao. The *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* states: \"Bodhisattvas should dwell as they have been taught.\" When bodhisattvas cultivate buddhahood, the mind must dwell as they have been taught, only then can they realize buddhahood. Thus, the sūtra says: \"If bodhisattvas wish to cultivate buddhahood, they should dwell as the Buddha has taught.\" \"Taught\" refers to the Dao-embryo. To attain the full realization of the Dao-embryo’s position, one must first stabilize the mind. The key to stabilizing the mind is to abide in the samādhi of true breath. With stabilization, one does not fall into the six sense realms or follow delusion—thus, with correct samādhi, correct awakening is achieved.\n\nThis is what the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* means by \"the first dhyāna abiding in mindfulness, the second dhyāna abiding in breath.\" The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"Having roamed in the Dao-embryo, one reverently attends to awakening.\" This describes spirit entering *qi* and *qi* enveloping spirit, profound and silent, dim and deep—like the scene within a mother’s womb. Hence it is called the Dao-embryo. It is also said: \"Before the parents’ birth, one creates and transforms oneself, possessing the great *dhāraṇī*.\" Thus it is called \"reverently attending to awakening.\"\n\nThe *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* says: \"Bodhisattvas, with respect to dharmas, should practice generosity without abiding.\"",

      "translated_text": "Having regulated the mind as described earlier, one must first abide in embryonic breathing. Once the mind is settled, one must not cling to the breath; if one clings to it moment after moment, abiding in the presence of breath, then the breath will bind the mind just as the six senses bind it—this is a mind that has not attained liberation. Thus it is said: \"With respect to dharmas, one should practice generosity without abiding.\" Here, the dharma is the breath. Once the mind has settled, one should relinquish the breath. As the ancient worthies said: \"To cross the river, one needs a raft; upon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer needed.\" The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: \"Abiding in the tranquility of all samādhis, wisdom enters the deathless Way.\" \"Abiding in the tranquility of all samādhis\" means the nostrils emit no breath, the six pulses in both hands are all stilled, and one enters great samādhi, utterly free from arising and ceasing—this is what the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* calls \"the third dhyāna, where the pulses abide.\" With all the sense faculties stilled, one attains constant bliss and the true self. \"Tranquil wisdom\" is the true awakening within samādhi. Abiding in tranquility, samādhi perfects correct and equal awakening—the deathless Way that the true person has personally realized. The World-Honored One spoke of \"the remainderless *nirvāṇa*.\" \"Remainderless\" means the absence of exhalation and inhalation. \"*Nirvāṇa*\" does not mean death; it is the bliss of samādhi and *samāpatti*. With the six senses extinguished and all conditions ungrasped, the one nature is perfectly fused, wisdom’s light shines clearly, and the dharma-realm is empty—this is the wondrous state of remainderless *nirvāṇa*. It is what the Tathāgata meant by \"clearly not receiving the prediction from Dīpaṃkara, for one’s own numinous light illumines past and present.\" The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: \"Ever with pure mindfulness, abide in supreme awakening.\" \"Pure mindfulness\" means not abiding in defiled delusion nor in the fetters of dharmas—it is the unarising, unceasing, correct mindfulness within samādhi, what the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* calls \"the fourth dhyāna and the extinction of all outflows.\" \"Supreme awakening\" is the perfect and complete awakening of the Buddha-Way, where wisdom’s light shines brightly without day or night, where great freedom is attained and the six supernormal powers are fully realized—this is truly called supreme awakening. Yet when mindfulness abides, wisdom naturally arises and illuminates; one must guard wisdom and not employ it. If one does not maintain samādhi but clings to the mind of attainment, employing it will lead to demonic states, where the discriminating mind causes harm and all prior merit is lost. Thus Dīpaṃkara Buddha said: \"Quiescence is bliss.\" \"Quiescence\" does not mean death; it is the true realization of the embryo’s nature fully penetrated. Therefore, the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When the Way of awakening is perfectly complete, the Buddha-nature’s manifestation is quiescent and still, while wisdom shines clearly; radiant and luminous, samādhi and awakening are non-doing. The mind is free from delusion, the nature is free from arising and ceasing—this is what the Sixth Patriarch called 'the mind of meditation without thought, the nature of meditation without arising.' The six pulses are entirely absent, the breath through the nostrils is extinguished—hence it is called quiescence. The embryo of the Dao and the Buddha-nature merge like the rising sun—thus it is called bliss.\" It is also called \"true emptiness and non-doing.\" At this stage, when snowflakes drift in the sky, the signs of emerging from samādhi appear. If one shifts attention beyond Mount Sumeru before attaining great samādhi, no signs of emergence will manifest. To emerge rashly is to enter demonic paths; to have signs appear yet not emerge is to become a corpse-guarding ghost, devoid of the wisdom of supernormal powers—merely another foolish person. Thus Maitreya Buddha said: \"Though you endure for eighty thousand kalpas, in the end you fall into emptiness and perish.\" Therefore, I say: the wondrous method of passing the *śarīra* through the barrier is to illuminate with stillness and act with softness. The path is perilous—guard against scattering above and below. Wait for movement, then guide with softness and proceed with care. Warm with gentle fire, nourish with the two *qi*, cultivate stillness and illumination together, and settle into dual forgetting—thus the method of the Dao-embryo is attained. This reiterates the method of nurturing the Dao with the *śarīra*. Moreover, \"still illumination\" is the proper practice for obtaining the *śarīra*. Without stillness, it will not arise; without illumination, it will not emerge from the furnace. How can the method of still illumination for obtaining the *śarīra* be neglected? Thus the World-Honored One said: \"Where the mind and eyes are focused lies the perilous path.\" The yang pass, the anus, and the nostrils are the places where outflows are exhausted. One must first use the dharma-vessel to restrain and protect against the danger of these three apertures. Without a true teacher’s transmission, one will surely lose and perish in reckless wandering here. Only by guiding and opening, moving and proceeding together, entrusting the mind to vigilant protection, can one be said to \"skillfully guard the precious pearl.\" At this time, it is like crossing a small bridge. Thus it is said: wait for movement, then proceed; proceed with softness and care. The embryo relies on the *qi* of the *śarīra*, just as if it were not nurtured by breathing. The Buddha-child emerging from samādhi is like the fetus in the mother’s womb, formed by the two *qi* and nurtured by breathing. When the mother exhales, the fetus exhales; when the mother inhales, the fetus inhales—so too with the Dao-embryo. When the Dao-embryo is first formed, it relies on the fire of breathing for warmth and nurture. By the fifth or sixth month, the two *qi* gradually diminish, and by the eighth or ninth month, the two *qi* are entirely stilled—one knows only spirit and not *qi*. If one becomes empty at this time and remains utterly vacant, one falls into the view of annihilation. Thus, emptiness must yet seem non-empty—this is true quiescence that is ever-illuminating. If one knows only non-emptiness and remains solely in that state, one falls into the view of eternalism. Thus, non-emptiness must yet seem empty—this is true illumination that is ever-quiescent. Upon attaining great samādhi, perfectly merged as one, the signs of emerging from samādhi will appear. The true instructions above have never been clearly spoken throughout the ages; they have been inverted and metaphorically expressed, making them difficult to comprehend. I have assembled and arranged them step by step to complete the meaning—truly the boat and ladder for learners of the Buddha-Way through ten thousand generations. Have you not heard the words of the fifty-scroll *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*?",

      "translated_text": "The World-Honored One emitted great radiance from the white curl between his brows, called the \"Manifestation of the Tathāgata.\" What follows describes the signs of emerging from samādhi. The preceding text spoke only of nurturing the embryo, yet the moment of emergence from samādhi remained unclear. Fearing that later generations would not grasp this principle, the Tathāgata, out of great compassion, declared that from the light of the white curl would arise the evidence for all ages to come. For the celestial mechanism of emerging from samādhi is not something ordinary monks can attain. From the Han dynasty until now, who among those seen by others has truly known it? This is the verification of the Tathāgata’s own realization when emerging from samādhi. At that moment, one may emit white light or golden light; when the original nature perceives something, one should immediately seek a teacher to apply the method of gathering the light. If the light is not gathered, it will scatter. The formed cannot transform into the formless; though the nature is wondrous, the form is not—this is not the complete Dharma of the World-Honored One and Bodhidharma’s quiescent non-being. Learners must urgently seek a teacher, lest they miss this opportunity, for it will never come again.\n\nMaster Jixu of Quiescent Non-being said:\nWhen the embryo is complete and the season arrives, snowflakes fly,\nThought stirs and drifts toward the sky’s mechanism.\nDo not say the Tathāgata’s Way is barren quiescence—\nThe Dharmakāya emerges from quiescence and returns to refuge.\n\nThis describes the moment of emerging from samādhi: if one should emerge but does not, one becomes stagnant in the Dharmakāya, bound by samādhi, unable to attain supernatural powers or manifest a hundred billion transformation bodies. \"When the embryo is complete and the season arrives\" refers to the perfection of the Dao-embryo. Seeing snowflakes depart the mortal body, with thought stirring toward the great void—if one does not recognize this mechanism, one has not found a true teacher. Nowadays, in the monasteries, monks sit in dry meditation, gathering the mind as the Way, exalting themselves and deceiving donors and disciples. They mislead themselves and others, unaware of the Tathāgata’s white light or the ancestral snowflakes. They merely rely on the Buddha’s teachings for shelter, consuming the faithful offerings of donors while forgetting the great kindness of their parents. Born with a male body, standing tall beneath heaven and earth, if they do not awaken to this Dao, are they not pitiful?\n\nWhen the Dharmakāya emerges from samādhi and departs the mortal frame, it must swiftly return to the Niwan Palace to nurture purity for another seven days before emerging again. At the first emergence, one may see wondrous visions of buddhas, ancestors, or bodhisattvas—these must not be acknowledged, for they are transformations of Māra. If recognized, one will be led astray, losing one’s own body without refuge. Since the Buddha-fruit is not yet perfected and one cannot stand firm, how can one be reborn in later ages? One must cultivate through the nine grounds, reaching the tenth ground, and further uphold the eleventh ground of Equal Enlightenment to transcend the formless realm.\n\nAt the first emergence, when the light appears three to five feet from the body, one must not be startled or alarmed; nothing should be acknowledged. Only when a golden light as large as a chariot wheel appears should one direct thought into the light, gathering it into the nature—this is the wondrous foundation of transforming form. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"Form emerges from the embryo, becoming a true child of the Buddha.\" After ten months of nurturing the Dao-embryo, receiving the nourishment of the two qi, when the embryo is complete and the nature is settled, this is called \"emerging from samādhi with formed body.\" Wisdom becomes vast, seeing and knowing all, appearing and disappearing at will. When gathered, it takes form; when scattered, it has no origin. Its light pervades the Dharma realm, and gods and spirits protect it—thus it is called a child of the Buddha.\n\nThe *Lotus Sūtra* says: \"The World-Honored One emitted white light from his brow, illuminating eighteen thousand worlds to the east, pervading all without exception. From the Avīci Hell below to the Akaniṣṭha Heaven above, the south, west, and north were all equally illuminated.\" When the Dharmakāya emerges from samādhi for a long time, there is nothing it does not see, as if in the palm of its hand. The Akaniṣṭha Heaven is the name of the summit of the form realm, the Heaven of Ultimate Form. When the Dao-embryo is perfected after ten months of samādhi, one’s merit and practice reach this heaven—thus, upon emerging from samādhi, one naturally arrives here. Seeing the four directions, above and below, is not by deliberate effort but arises spontaneously.\n\nThe Great Awakened Golden Immortal Tathāgata said: \"From the flesh-crown, a hundred-jeweled light surged forth, and from the light emerged a thousand-petaled jeweled lotus, with a transformation Tathāgata seated within the flower.\" This is the passage from the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* recited morning and evening, yet ordinary monks do not know its origin and recite it in vain. The Golden Immortal is how the World-Honored One refers to himself in the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, sometimes called the Great Immortal, the Seven Immortals, or the Assembly of Immortals—there is no fixed name.\n\nLiaoran asked: \"Buddhist monks today regard immortals as a lesser path. Why then does the Tathāgata call himself by these four immortal names?\" The answer: \"The Buddha originally makes no distinction between self and other; such distinctions are made by ordinary monks. When the Tathāgata calls himself the Four Immortals, it is precisely to prevent cultivators of the Way from clinging to sectarian divisions, guiding all to return to the Tathāgata’s wisdom-life Dao.\"\n\nLiaoran further asked: \"The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* speaks of ten kinds of immortals whose rewards are exhausted and who fall again—why is this?\" The answer: \"The ten spirit-immortals fall because, when they began their practice, they did not follow the wisdom-life Dao but pursued peripheral, lesser methods. Thus, their attainment is also a lesser fruit, and so they fall. If one begins with the wisdom-life, one is not called one of the ten immortals but a Golden Immortal. Moreover, gold corresponds to the west and is in fact qi. Qi pertains to yang, while spirit pertains to yin. When yin obtains this yang, it becomes a yang-spirit—visible to others and capable of grasping objects. A yin-spirit is invisible to others and cannot grasp objects.\"\n\nThe World-Honored One said: \"Upon first attaining perfect enlightenment, he entered the dragon palace and abided in samādhi for seven days. He appeared beneath the bodhi tree and abided in samādhi for seven days. By the second and third seven-day periods, in the grove of milk trees, he abided in samādhi for seven times seven—forty-nine days—without eating.\"",

      "translated_text": "When first emerging from samādhi, he nurtured himself for another seven days before emerging again, then another fourteen days before emerging again, then twenty-one days before emerging again, and finally forty-nine days before emerging once more.\n\n\"Milk\" is a Sanskrit term from the western regions. In this land, it is called \"nurturing with milk,\" likened to a child emerging from the mother’s womb—though possessing human form, it cannot walk far or speak, and fully depends on the mother’s grace, nourished day and night with milk, before it can walk and speak on its own, its wisdom expanding boundlessly. So too is it with the Buddha’s disciples after emerging from samādhi. The day-and-night nurturing with milk occurs in the mud-womb; here, without eating or drinking, one cultivates and expands wisdom, transforming one into two, two into three, and endlessly multiplying. Thus it is said there are a thousand, a hundred million transformation bodies.\n\nSomeone may ask: *The* Five Lamps Meeting at the Source *calls entering samādhi an external path—does this not make what is spoken of here an external path as well?* The answer is: When *Meeting at the Source* speaks of entering samādhi as an external path, it refers to those who have not attained the wisdom-life or the dharma-emptiness of the śarīra, merely gathering the mind into samādhi—this is the calculation of the yin-spirit, not the yang-spirit, hence it is called an external path. What the World-Honored One speaks of here is entering samādhi after attaining the wisdom-life and forming the śarīra within the dharma-womb, after emerging from the womb. *Meeting at the Source* fails to distinguish these methods, thus mixing them into one statement and misleading later generations. Moreover, the Sixth Patriarch’s wisdom-life Dao is truly secret and has not been transmitted. What has been passed down is nothing but the solitary nature, hence they do not know of the World-Honored One’s forty-nine-day samādhi practice. If one does not understand the World-Honored One’s wisdom-life dharma-womb and calls entering samādhi an external path, how could the World-Honored One have initially practiced an external path? And how could later generations dare to call him the Most Honored One! The World-Honored One also said: *In eighty thousand kalpas, there is but one samādhi*—is this also an external path? This passage speaks of the forty-nine days without food as the World-Honored One’s own realization. If one cannot even go three days without food, what is there to discuss? Those who study the Buddha-Dao should quickly seek a teacher to point out the wisdom-life śarīra dharma-womb, so that they may have hope. Otherwise, ten refinements will leave nine empty, and they will wither away of their own accord, becoming nothing more than solitary spirits of discriminating consciousness.\n\nThe World-Honored One said: *The Dharma of protective mindfulness now abides long.* This refers to returning to the mud-pill palace, the work of nurturing with milk. The earlier mention of \"milk\" is the method of protective mindfulness. \"Abiding long\" means the true thought should reside in the mud-pill palace, hence it is called the Great Samādhi.\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: *Though having realized quiescent extinction, diligently cultivate practice, and you will transcend the unshakable ground of space. The Buddha urges one to arise from quiescent extinction and broadly cultivate all kinds of wisdom-activities.* The earlier mention of \"abiding long\" means that after attaining the cessation of arising and ceasing, one enters quiescent extinction. Though in quiescent extinction, one must continue cultivation to achieve long-lasting quiescence, like adding space upon space, reaching the utterly unshakable ground. The Buddha instructs: *From the initial attainment of quiescent extinction, one must diligently cultivate practice, advancing in wisdom without cease.* Empty and yet again empty, void and yet again void—thus it is said: *When the realm of space is exhausted, my cultivation will still have no end.*\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* also says: *Abiding perpetually in nirvāṇa, like space.* The nature is like space, not clinging to the appearance of space—hence it is called \"space.\" If one clings to the appearance of space, then there is a \"space\" that exists, and one is hindered by space, no longer being space. Space is thus naturally so, not something that is made to be so—hence it is said \"like space.\" It also says: *The mind is constantly in right samādhi, extinguishing the arising of awareness, yet manifesting with the wisdom of omniscience. From this unshakable state, one enters the formless samādhi.* This again speaks of returning to the nature of emptiness. When one reaches the realm of space, the true mind is constantly in samādhi, all wisdom-observations extinguished, utterly boundless. One may remain in samādhi for three years, or nine years—within, a single golden light of true fire is concealed. Over days and months, the ordinary body also transforms into qi, and as the spirit becomes wondrous, so too does the form.\n\nLike the World-Honored One after entering nirvāṇa: his mother came, weeping in sorrow, rising into empty space, and he preached the Dharma to her. Like Bodhidharma after entering nirvāṇa in Shaolin: he returned west with only one sandal, and on the road, he personally bid farewell to a minister, sending a message back to Shaolin. When the minister returned to the temple and opened the coffin, there was no body inside—only an empty coffin. Like Master Jiwu in Taiyi: his ordinary body transformed into a hundred thousand forms, vanishing without a trace when hidden. Sometimes he gave people gold and silver, sometimes beautiful women; sometimes he manifested as tigers or dragons, or traveled ten thousand miles in an instant. The Chan master concealed himself in Mount Lu, returning to emptiness—this is the constantly abiding mind, how could it be lacking? Thus the World-Honored One said: *In eighty thousand kalpas, there is but one samādhi.*\n\nThe *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* says: *The Tathāgata’s perfect enlightenment.* Perfect enlightenment means the true nature returns to emptiness, reaching the ultimate of the void. Neither ordinary nor sacred, neither day nor night—one nature, the great void. As Shaozi said: *The Dao extends beyond the formed world of heaven and earth; thought enters the transformations of wind and clouds.* When heaven and earth perish in kalpas, this alone does not perish. Thus the *Amitābha Sūtra* speaks of *ten kalpas since attaining Buddhahood.*\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: *The dharma-nature is like space; all buddhas dwell within it.* Since the nature is like space, there is nothing to be done. Yet it also says *dwelling within it*—there is truly a principle of returning. Many do not awaken to this, failing to realize that this is the wondrous method of refining emptiness, the secret of the true nature returning to the central palace. This central palace is what the Tathāgata calls the *ocean of Vairocana’s nature*. Dwelling the true nature in this nature-ocean is like nurturing a dragon pearl—untouched by anything. Relying on the samādhi of complete extinction, one enters quiescence. Even if there is light, it is gathered and concealed. In samādhi upon samādhi, over time, the nature-light transforms into a śarīra. Light bursts forth from the nature-ocean, transforming into ten thousand, a hundred million rays of fine light, piercing the great void and meeting with the ancient buddhas and tathāgatas.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, Great Awakening Chan Master said:\n*A single śarīra radiates brilliance,\nIlluminating boundless kalpas without end,\nThe great chiliocosm all returns to refuge.*\n\nMoreover, Heze Chan Master said:\n*The original face is true suchness,\nIn the śarīra’s light, one recognizes it.\nAfter ten thousand kalpas lost in delusion, now at last awakened,\nOnly then does one know one’s own nature is Mañjuśrī—\nJust so.*\n\nThe foregoing all speaks of the śarīra’s passage through the barrier, the wondrous method of nurturing the Dao-embryo, emerging from samādhi, and returning to emptiness. Is not the Way of wisdom-life entirely herein?\n\nI dare not claim this compilation as my own discourse on the wondrous Dao; it is all a gathering of the true transmissions of former sages. For those in future kalpas who aspire with determination, it is the root of awakening to the Buddha-Way and cultivating the wisdom-life. May those who encounter it immediately awaken and realize it, aligning with the true intent of the buddhas and patriarchs, thereby perfecting themselves and others—thus attaining the fruition of the Buddha-Way.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Direct Discourse on Cultivating the Orthodox Dao**\n\nHuayang said: To cultivate is to break and then mend the whole.\nFor humans are born possessing the complete body of nature and life, yet in their prime, when qi is full, it naturally leaks. Before breaking occurs, if one encounters an enlightened teacher’s guidance, one need not employ the method of mending—one may instantly transcend and directly enter the Tathāgata’s ground. For those already broken, one must mend to restore the complete body.\n\nMoreover, in mending, one must rely on the dynamic mechanism to gather the outwardly dispersed qi and replenish the deficient qi. When qi is fully restored and the generative mechanism ceases to move, the appearance of the \"hidden horse\" emerges—this is called the \"immortal arhat.\"\n\nTo refine is to transform things with fire.\nAnd the \"thing\" is none other than one’s original qi. Though original qi is stored in the qi-cavern, when it moves outward, it becomes the resource of leakage. Now that it has returned to the source, one employs fire to transform it back into qi.\n\nFire does not burn without wind.\nThe preceding text spoke of using fire to transform things, but if one does not know to employ wind, the thing will be difficult to transform. Thus, one must use the breath—inhale and exhale—to blow the fire, so that the thing may be transformed into qi.\n\nThings have no place without a dwelling.\nThe dwelling is the qi-cavern. When things arise, they originally emerge from the qi-cavern; now they return to the qi-cavern, and fire and wind are also applied here. Therefore, the perfected one investigates the great Dao, cultivates nature and life, and unifies the loci of wind, fire, and thing in simultaneous use. Directing the intent into the qi-cavern and reversing the breath to blow it—is this not their simultaneous use?\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, those who have accomplished the Dao have all taken this as essential. From a thousand ages past to a thousand ages hence, for this person with this mind who seeks to accomplish the Dao, there is nothing but nature and life. And the union of nature and life is nothing but wind and fire—this is what is meant by \"there is no second Dao under heaven, no second mind in the sage.\"\n\nAlas, those who know this are few, while those who remain ignorant are many. Moreover, among those in the world who study Buddhism, some recite sutras and prostrate to the Buddha daily, others receive precepts and study scriptures, and the most advanced engage in Chan meditation and seated practice. Yet when it comes to the two words \"nature\" and \"life,\" scarcely anyone in the world understands them. Clinging to nature while neglecting life, unaware of movement and stillness, they often grow old in vain.\n\nFor today’s Buddhist practitioners believe that the Buddha cultivated nature but not life, unaware that the Tathāgata’s great treasury of teachings advocates the dual cultivation of nature and life. Being and non-being are originally employed together, yet they cling to dead Chan, ignorant of the dynamic mechanism. Beginners may resemble the Buddha, but over time, finding no efficacy, they grow disheartened and abandon their practice—dying in vain, what benefit is there?\n\nWhen life moves, it dissipates outward; when exhausted, alas, where does nature reside? Where does the Dao abide?\n\nThose in the Buddhist world today, not having received the Tathāgata’s true transmission, cling to nature while ignorant of the treasure of life. When the wisdom-life stirs, not knowing the method to gather and stabilize it, even if it does not transform into leakage, it naturally scatters. When exhausted, how can there be no death? Once dead, what remains to be called the Dao?\n\nThus, the perfected one observes the ebb and flow of movement and stillness, uniting them in dual cultivation. Moreover, when worldly people seek to cultivate, they immediately leave behind parents, spouse, and children, secluding themselves in remote mountains or grand monasteries, believing that stillness alone can cultivate the Dao—how laughable!\n\nIf one seeks the true transmission yet remains in such barren stillness, ignorant of the dynamic mechanism, it is like a foolish cat guarding an empty burrow—what benefit is there? Therefore, Radiant Tathāgata of Purple Gold said: \"Without discerning movement and stillness, studying the Dao is futile.\"\n\nThe perfected one quiets the mind to await the movement of the kidneys. Shifting to the locus of movement, one unites and refines them—when heart and kidneys merge, this is the union of nature and life. Thus, the ancients said: \"The one unified appearance is precisely this.\"\n\nThe root of life lies in the kidneys; when the kidneys move, it is water. Life is original qi; when qi moves, it transforms into water. The root of nature lies in the heart; when the heart moves, it is fire. Nature is true intent; when intent moves, it transforms into fire.\n\nDirect fire into water.\nDirect the intent from the heart into the qi of the kidneys—thus the wisdom-life does not dissipate outward. When qi is stabilized by intent, it no longer races outward.\n\nUse wind to blow fire and transform it into the true seed.\nWind is the breath of inhalation and exhalation; fire is intent. The preceding text spoke of qi being stabilized by intent, so it no longer races outward. Yet within it, the lingering shadows of leakage remain untransformed. Therefore, one must employ the breath—reversing the inhalation and exhalation—to blow the fire in the furnace, transforming these lingering shadows of leakage into qi. Otherwise, this thing will stir up trouble, disturbing the sovereign mind with thoughts of desire and passion—what Mencius called \"qi can also move the will.\"\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* also refers to this as \"yin demons.\" One must refine them ceaselessly over a long duration, transforming these yin demons into yang light. Then body and mind will naturally be at peace, and emotions and desires will naturally be unable to disturb.",

Relying on the samādhi of complete extinction, one enters quiescence. Even if there is light, it is gathered and concealed.

Light bursts forth from the nature-ocean, transforming into ten thousand, a hundred million rays of fine light, piercing the great void and meeting with the ancient buddhas and tathāgatas.",

      "translated_text": "When movement arises, gather it. Once the mechanism stirs, use intention to collect it. Refine it in the same crucible. Intention and qi merge as one—this is called \"fire transformation.\" The World-Honored One termed it \"fire transformation,\" walking the Tathāgata’s path. The path refers to the Conception and Governing Vessels, also called the Wheel of Dharma’s route. Abiding beneath the World-Honored One’s tree—this \"tree\" signifies the pure land of the cinnabar field. Long ago, the World-Honored One cultivated and refined beneath the bodhi tree, entering samādhi precisely here. This is called \"movement and abiding.\" As Chan Master Daoyi said, \"There is no movement without abiding, no position without movement\"—this is it. Moreover, the movement and abiding of fire truly follow the transformations of things. When things move, intention must also move; when things abide, intention must also abide.\n\nWhen yin demons appear, immediately apply the martial fire to refine them, averting the peril of dissipation and leakage. These yin demons are the yin qi within the body. Their manifestations—whether visions of yin beings in dreams, bodily obstructions, apparitions of yin figures during meditation, or dreams of tigers and monsters—are all transformations of yin qi, the corrupting ailments that leak śarīra. One must fiercely refine them with wind and fire, burning until ghosts wail and spirits howl within, exhausting the yin demons before danger is averted. Then, in purity, tranquility, and great peace, gently nurture and warmly cultivate to fortify the protection of the precious pearl. The body remains free of strange visions, with intention overseeing and nurturing.\n\nWhen turning the Wheel of Dharma, employ both civil and martial methods in tandem. The subtleties and profound mysteries therein depend on the master’s transmission and one’s own awakening. The practice of turning the Wheel of Dharma involves ascent and descent as martial, bathing as civil—yet within ascent and descent, both civil and martial are present. All hinges on the master’s transmission, while the subtleties lie in self-realization.\n\nWhen śarīra forms, cease the martial and apply the civil’s gentle accumulation. As śarīra takes shape, use the civil fire to gather it. If one fails to stop and continues with martial fire, the formed śarīra will be dispersed by its force—this is a critical danger, most essential to recognize. This is called \"warm cultivation,\" truly likened to preservation.\n\nWhen śarīra forms, halt the martial fire of breath and employ the civil fire of spirit-light’s reflection. True intention must constantly oversee and protect it, guarding against peril. At that time—when śarīra is about to emerge—the luminous pearl appears and a hundred demons vanish. The luminous pearl is śarīra. Once śarīra forms, it manifests clearly, while the hundred demons are the body’s yin qi and chronic ailments. With the pearl’s appearance, yin qi and chronic afflictions instantly dissolve—hence, they are said to vanish.\n\nGently traverse the great path of Caoxi. Caoxi refers to the marrow path of the spine. When gathering śarīra, one must proceed along this path with softness and slowness. If it rushes along another route, śarīra cannot be obtained. Once the Dao-embryo is established, a thousand wisdoms arise. As śarīra returns to the central palace, white hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow, and wisdom expands boundlessly—past and future become fully known. Yet one must beware: this wisdom must not be misused.\n\nWarm cultivation is indeed the verification of settled wisdom, like an unshaken proof.",

      "translated_text": "When one reaches this stage, all is nurtured by the gentle fire of refinement, with nothing lost. This is what is meant by \"once verified, forever verified\"—constantly abiding in self-awareness at the center, with wisdom illuminating the sea of nature. Yet wisdom must not be employed; one must diligently cultivate *dhyāna*. For *dhyāna* is stillness, and *nā* is nature. At this stage, one cultivates only one’s own settled nature, regulating one’s own breath and fire. All perceptions—past and future fortunes and misfortunes—are known but must not be used. The radiance of numinous wisdom thus grows ever brighter. When wisdom is not employed, the nature of the Dao-embryo becomes increasingly numinous and penetrating. Serene illumination brings constant self-awakening, and the body transcends the regrets of torpor and distraction. This speaks of stillness that is ever luminous. *Awakening* means knowing. Within *samādhi*, one must possess right awakening and insight before once more perceiving the nature-body. As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says, \"Ever abide in pure mindfulness, dwelling in supreme awakening.\" If one follows torpor, the embryo has no breath and falls into ignorance, becoming akin to the lifeless emptiness of externalist paths. If one follows distraction, the embryo has no master, the fire cools, the qi is exhausted, and nothing is accomplished. The power of steadfastness lies in the sincerity of a single thought within emptiness-nature. For the embryo’s steadfast power resides in the sincerity of a single thought. Over ten months, the embryo must be held in thought after thought, with the breath settled and the thought stabilized—only then will the embryo be complete. As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says, \"Abide in tranquil stillness, with all the wisdom of *samādhi*, entering the deathless Way.\"\n\nWhen the nature of dharma is settled, snowflakes swirl in chaos. Within the quiet chamber, one may suddenly see snowflakes flying—this is the time of the embryo’s kingdom. This is called emerging from *samādhi*. When the signs of emergence appear, one must emerge. If one does not, one becomes stagnant within the embryo, lacking the transformations of spiritual powers and wisdom. Though the embryo may be complete, one remains but a fool. For within the extreme stillness of the great Dao, a dynamic impulse arises—what is called \"the jade sight restored at midnight, the true essence once more stirring at its utmost.\" This *essence* is the supreme yang substance. When this essence reaches the extreme of stillness, it stirs of itself. For yang has no principle of total exhaustion. When the perfected one creates anew like the sun and moon, aligning emotions with nature, they turn and unite. This is called \"re-creating the wondrous Dao, re-establishing precepts, *samādhi*, and wisdom.\" This stage of practice was concealed by the ancients, either to avoid leaking celestial secrets or because those who had not attained it were unworthy. For all cultivators who gather this essence within, the dharma-body that emerges from *samādhi* must also be returned within, merging into one and entering great *samādhi*. Unceasing *samādhi* leads to the infinite and the utmost.\n\n**Direct Discussion of the Dao’s Work, Chapter Eleven**\nMaster Huayang says: When practicing, one must be in a quiet chamber. A quiet chamber is a place far from idle company, lest they disturb one’s stillness. The body is like withered wood—when sitting, one forgets form. The mind is like cold ashes—when still, one forgets the mind. Employ the numinous light, turning it inward to illuminate. Merge nature and life into the same palace, guiding nature into the palace of life. This is called the beginning of the Dao. For when one cultivates nature, life is already within it—hence, it is called the beginning.\n\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises. When one attains true stillness, an impulse suddenly stirs within—this is neither the ordinary mind nor intention, but the stirring of qi in the cinnabar field. The Fifth Patriarch called it \"when emotion comes,\" and the Sixth Patriarch called it \"lustful mind,\" which is the Dao-mind. For Buddhist practitioners, if one does not recognize this stirring, there is no place to begin, and cultivation is futile. This is the root and sprout of the great Dao. The buddhas and patriarchs, knowing this impulse arises, use methods to gather it back into the cinnabar field, refining it into a *śarīra*, transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood—hence, it is called cultivating the root and sprout of the great Dao. This is the master of creation. Yet ordinary people, not knowing cultivation, cannot control this stirring when it arises, and the mind also moves—what Mencius called \"qi can also move the will.\" Thus, when men and women unite, they give birth to human beings, and all things likewise arise from this stirring, as yin and yang naturally combine. Worldly people, out of their own lust, call those who cultivate the Dao lustful, truly unaware of the method. The buddhas and patriarchs wait for this impulse to stir, and before the mind can turn to thought, they refine it with fire and fan it with wind. The external organ retracts, the mind becomes as cool as water—what lust could there be? Even the tiniest creatures like the pyralid moth or louse have no lustful mind. This is the transformative nurturing of the Dao, the true impulse of heaven and earth, arising naturally, not by deliberate intent. The transformations of sages all lie in this interplay of compliance and reversal.\n\nQi revolves and the aperture opens. Qi, as the ancients called it, is also named *essence*, *water*, or *the affair of the inner chamber*—its designations are many. The aperture is the cinnabar field, the qi cavity. The opening is the Gate of Life. Medical texts mistakenly place it between the two kidneys, but it is actually below the navel. In women, it is called the uterine gate—this is the same. Where men and women discharge essence is precisely this place.\n\nThe emotions of the wisdom-life incline outward. For *wisdom-life* is the Buddha’s skillful metaphor, what in China is called *original qi*. From the moment of conception, one receives the qi of the master of creation, which resides within, and the buddha-nature is also there. This is what is meant by \"what is mandated by heaven is called nature.\" It connects the eight vessels to the mother’s breath, while the mouth and nose have no qi. At the moment of birth, when the mouth and nose open, the eight vessels close, and the original qi is stored within. In maturity, the original qi gathers at the pass and emerges.",

Once the Dao-embryo is established, a thousand wisdoms arise. As śarīra returns to the central palace, white hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow, and wisdom expands boundlessly—past and future become fully known. Yet one must beware: this wisdom must not be misused.\n\nWarm cultivation is indeed the verification of settled wisdom, like an unshaken proof.",

      "translated_text": "The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls this the attainment of the \"leakage-exhausting penetration.\" Once the aperture is opened, the mechanism, once triggered, has no other path to follow but to proceed along this familiar route. I had a lay cousin, styled Daokuan, whose Dharma name was Yuanming. He resided at Jinshan for many years, having obtained the method of Jinshan. Later, he became the abbot of Yongshui Hermitage in Beiyi, yet in both Chan and doctrinal teachings, he paid no heed to this matter, as if it were mere overwatering—awakening only to one’s own nature without investigating further. I said to him: \"If there is leakage, then it resembles the lustful coupling of ordinary beings. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states that if one does not sever the lustful body, lustful mind, and lustful root, it is like steaming sand and stones in the hope of making rice: even after a hundred thousand kalpas, it will only become cooked sand. One will inevitably enter demonic paths, revolving through the three evil destinies, never to escape. How can Chan and doctrinal teachings ignore this?\" The Dao of the Tathāgata’s *wisdom-life* is transmitted from buddha to buddha, patriarch to patriarch. If one can apply it oneself, the three kinds of lustful affairs will be severed through a single refinement. Therein lies a profound principle.\n\nTo gather it within—\nto gather it through inhalation—\nif breath is not governed by intention, it has no master.\n\"Within\" refers to the cinnabar field.\n\"Subtle and continuous as if present\" means to keep the thought fixed upon it.\nHarmonizing and fusing, it becomes the womb-source of the true seed—\nthis is the true transmission of the correct Dao.\nThe method of gathering inward described above is here expounded as the work of moment-to-moment nurturing.\nOnce the *wisdom-life* has returned to its source, one must then constantly regulate the breath and guard the intention at every moment, as if tending a flame in the furnace. Intention and *qi* are both smelted, transforming into the true seed. This is the dual cultivation of nature and *wisdom-life*. With time, \"nothing\" gives birth to \"something.\" All else is but side doors, leading ultimately to no attainment.\n\nThe ancients spoke of \"fire transformation\"—\n\"fire\" is true intention.\nThey spoke of \"harmonization\"—\nthe union of nature and *wisdom-life*.\nThey spoke of \"facing the Dipper\"—\n\"facing\" is inward contemplation;\nthe \"Dipper\" is the cinnabar field.\nThey spoke of \"cross-legged sitting\"—\ncross-legged sitting means using true intention to sit upon the watery surface of the north within one’s body, entering extinction—this is the initial method for entering the first pass.\n\nIn ancient times, the Venerable Śāṇavāsa saw Ānanda sitting cross-legged upon the water’s surface in the midst of the current, entering extinction. Three times he sought instruction, and later Ānanda transmitted to him the treasury of the true Dharma eye, making him the third patriarch. This elucidates the application of this Dao. The myriad skillful metaphors all refer to nothing more than the two things: nature and *wisdom-life*. The work must reach its timely fruition. Yet this is not the achievement of a single day or night; it is the accumulation of months and years. It also depends on whether one is diligent or indolent, young or old.\n\n\"Timeliness\" does not refer to the seasons of heaven but to the moment when the \"thing\" is produced within one’s body. From the midst of nothingness, the \"thing\" arises. When the \"thing\" arises, the mind has something to know. If one sits in blank emptiness, one will miss it when it appears. At this moment, one must not allow it to proceed naturally but must reverse its course. The arising of the \"thing\" is originally a downward, natural flow, so one uses intention and breath to gather it. Bodhidharma called this \"gathering and taking.\" Proceeding outward is the \"leakage-exhausting penetration\"; reversing its course is \"gathering and taking.\" Once the \"thing\" has returned to its source—the cinnabar field—there arises the wondrous movement of the Dharma wheel. The posterior ascent and anterior descent are called the Dharma wheel. This initiates the ebb and flow of opening and closing—\"opening and closing\" refers to the inner and outer breath. When the outer breath is at its lowest, the inner breath rises; when the outer breath rises, the inner breath descends. Circulating between above and below—\"circulating\" means dynamic movement; \"above\" is the crown, and \"below\" is the abdomen. The Sixth Patriarch said, \"I have one thing that props up heaven and supports the earth\"—this is it. It stands at the heart of heaven.",

      "translated_text": "At the heart of heaven is called the \"Central Yellow,\" residing at the very center of the heavens. It is also named the \"Celestial Stem\" or the \"Handle of the Dipper.\" In heaven, it is the heart of heaven; in man, it is true intention. If the Central Palace loses its true intention, it is like a minister losing his sovereign.\n\nWhenever turning the Dharma wheel, one must seat true intention at the Central Palace as the axle’s core, enabling the claws to revolve. It depends upon the Conception and Governor Vessels. When turning the Dharma wheel, intention and life-force must move in accord with the Conception and Governor Vessels. If intention moves while life-force does not, or life-force moves while intention does not, the elixir will not form. Return to the root and restore life—this is returning to one’s original ground. Hence, it is called the \"Four Phases and Six Phases.\" Gathering, sealing, ascending, descending, and bathing are all part of this process.\n\nWhen the count is complete and the substance is numinous, there exists the secret of gathering and passing through the gates. Having clarified the method of practice used earlier, with long and persistent cultivation, the inner cavities become full. In stillness, the celestial mechanism stirs, the entire body harmonizes in bliss, and the yang organ no longer rises—this is called \"the count complete, the substance numinous.\" Once the substance is numinous, one should gather and transport it past the three posterior gates, returning it to the Central Palace. The secret of this method is most wondrous and profound; though it should not be spoken of, I now speak of it.\n\nIf one gathers when it should not be gathered, the substance is too tender. If it arises but is not taken, it is like missing it face to face. This is due to not having received the true method—all because one has not received transmission from a teacher. To obtain the true method, one must humbly seek a teacher, protect and cherish them over time. Most who study the Dao in this world fail to receive the complete method because they already possess some knowledge or ability, belittle their teachers, and treat the Dharma lightly. If one can be humble and earnest, observe the rites of a disciple, and with sincere devotion protect and assist the teacher in attaining the Dao, how could one not receive the complete Way?\n\nCultivate virtue and offer resources. Virtue is the essence and function of the Dao. If one seeks the teacher’s Way but does not cultivate virtue, how can one encounter it? Virtue and the Dao are like a bird’s wings—without one, the other is useless. \"Resources\" refers to wealth. As the ancients said, \"Dharma and wealth are both offerings; through them, both self and others attain enlightenment.\" If one claims to cultivate the Dao yet does not give even a penny, seeking fame and reputation while using Buddhism as a disguise, even if a great enlightened master were present, they would turn away in disdain. Only then can one attain the great Dao.\n\nThose in the world who study Buddhism claim that sitting alone brings attainment—how absurd! Liu Zhilüe attained realization while sitting, but this was due to his powerful connections, which he shared with the Sixth Patriarch. This is the mechanism of the furnace’s firing. The furnace is the cinnabar field. It also relies on the still contemplation of intention, and the substance arises. Still contemplation of intention means, as the Tathāgata said, \"If one does not know where the mind and eyes abide, one cannot subdue worldly afflictions.\" Whether the substance emerges from the furnace or not depends entirely on the power of intention. Moreover, the \"substance\" is but a metaphor for primordial qi. The Tathāgata called it \"fire arising in the furnace\"—this is the teaching of Pimo Guangru Tathāgata. \"Fire\" is warmth, and \"arising\" is movement—this is the sign of the elixir’s formation. At this time, the image of the Maṇi appears.\n\nThe warmth mentioned above is the inner vision, while the image is the outer vision. Without fear or alarm—if one suddenly sees this vision without having received true transmission, mistaking it for something external and becoming startled, the mind will stir and the spirit scatter. The elixir will disperse, and the hope of attaining the Dao will be distant indeed. Move in unison: when life-force moves, intention moves; when life-force halts, intention halts—thus they proceed together. Be vigilant against the dangers of deviant paths. The deviant paths were explained in the collected sayings above.\n\nCross the ford of the Ganges. The Ganges refers to the marrow path within the spine, where there are places of obstruction above and below. True intention must ferry one across this point—hence, it is called the ford. Ascend from the Caoxi Stream to Vulture Peak. The Caoxi Stream is the marrow path mentioned above; Vulture Peak lies at the back of the head. Reach Mount Sumeru and descend the Tower of Nine Stories.

The south refers to the heart’s aperture. The heart delights in movement and dislikes stillness; it favors the new and rejects the old. Moment by moment it shifts, entering and exiting without cease, its abode unknown. From beginningless time until now, it has ceaselessly traversed the four modes of birth and six paths of existence—so it is said, \"When a person dies, the heart remains unknowing.\" Now, by good fortune, the wisdom-life arrives to subdue it, transmuting the conditioned nature into true nature, refining the consciousness-spirit into the primordial spirit—like lead restraining mercury, so mercury is stilled, its errant and playful nature extinguished.

When the Dao-embryo first forms, the postnatal breath appears as if existent yet does not adhere to existence—hence \"do not forget.\" Once the Dao-embryo is formed, the mind abides within it, motionless and silent; yet one must not succumb to dullness but remain ever awake and aware—hence \"do not cling to illumination.\"\n\nIn the stillness of samādhi, suddenly a vast moonwheel hangs in the void, rising from the cinnabar field to the space before the eyes. Retain it—with true intent, hold it there. A red sunwheel ascends within the moon, and sun and moon merge. Gather and conceal them, using the method to withdraw them into the central storehouse.\n\nIn the depth of quiescence, one abides in extinction, where not a single thought arises. The realm of being and non-being returns to primordial undifferentiation; true nature is emptiness and void. Thus is the state of non-doing. Utter vacuity is reached to its utmost.\n\nYet the great Dao is inexhaustible: extreme stillness gives rise to movement. A single entity ascends to unite with the Dao-embryo. For all things, when pushed to their limit, return to their origin—and the great Dao is no different. From extreme stillness arises the impulse of movement: a speck of pure yang, rising from the *yongquan* to the Central Palace, intimately embracing and merging with the Dao-embryo, becoming one with it. Thus the Dharma-wheel turns once more.\n\nWhen this essence returns to the Dao-embryo, it descends naturally, ascending from the *weilü* to the crown, then settling in the Central Palace—this is the supreme treasure that nurtures the embryo’s source. Stillness deepens into stillness, extinction into extinction. The breath ceases at the nostrils, the six pulses vanish from the hands—this is the great samādhi. The embryo is complete, and qi is full; celestial flowers scatter in profusion. Where celestial flowers descend, the embryo is full; where they do not, the embryo is incomplete.\n\nAt this stage, the Buddha-child’s concentration must shift and transcend the Three Realms. Upon witnessing this sign, one should immediately shift awareness and emerge from samādhi. The Three Realms refer to the lower cinnabar field, the Central Palace, and the crown gate—this is the manifestation of the Tathāgata. As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: \"The World-Honored One, from the white curl between his brows, emits a great radiance called the Tathāgata’s manifestation.\"\n\nWhen first emerging from samādhi, guard against incursions by external demons. Upon initial emergence, should buddhas or bodhisattvas appear and speak, do not engage in conversation—maintain right mindfulness, moving in and out without wandering far.\n\nA wheel of golden light, inherently one’s own numinous essence, is to be reclaimed as the wondrous elixir for transforming form. Upon emerging from samādhi, do not cling to any phenomena; only await the appearance of a golden lightwheel in the void. Draw the Dharma-body near the light, gather the light with the Dharma, and absorb it into the Dharma-body. Then the Dharma-body enters the mortal body, and over time, like nourishing milk, the mortal body is instantly transformed into qi. Should one fail to obtain this golden light, the mortal body cannot be transmuted into qi—hence the teaching of preserving the body, which depends on the power of virtue.\n\nThis is the celestial mechanism guarded for ages, now revealed. Gather and nurture it, and it will be passed down through generations. When first emerging, one remains a single body; with prolonged samādhi, a hundred thousand billion transformation bodies arise.\n\nWhen vows are fulfilled and practice complete, withdraw into deep valleys, leaving no trace, returning to the void to merge with the wondrous Dao. When merit is full, retreat into remote mountain caves, where no one comes or goes. Sit in perfect stillness, refining form into qi, spirit returning to the void—both form and spirit become empty. This is the Tathāgata’s final affair.\n\nI urge fellow practitioners: do not mistake superficial Chan or external samādhis for the true Way, for they are not the true Way.\n\n**On the Chan Mechanism, Chapter Twelve**\nHuayang says: The Buddha-Dao, nature and life, are likened to dragon and tiger; dragon and tiger to movement and stillness; movement and stillness to the Chan mechanism—why so many metaphors? From birth, humans possess nothing but nature and life; what else could there be? To attain the Dao, one must first preserve nature and life. The repository of nature and life is also called dragon and tiger. The movements and stillness of dragon and tiger are also called activity and quiescence. Activity is the mechanism; quiescence is Chan. A thousand names and ten thousand metaphors all refer to nothing but nature and life. Apart from these two, everything else is but a deceptive lure to delude the foolish.\n\nThe ancient buddhas said: Without understanding nature and life, the great Dao cannot be accomplished. Through countless doors and gates, expending every effort, yet not knowing nature and life—or cultivating only nature or only life—nothing will be achieved. All buddhas and patriarchs have refined and cultivated nothing but nature and life. Since ancient times, no one has attained the fruit of realization without cultivating nature and life.\n\nYet if it is called nature and life, why also speak of the Chan mechanism? A tranquil heart is Chan; the stirring of the kidneys is the mechanism. From birth, humans receive nature and life as a single mass. When conceived, the qi of father and mother unite into one qi, and a speck of numinous light—nature—resides within. The ancients’ saying that the three families harmonize to form the body is no falsehood.\n\nAt birth, it divides into two. With the first cry—*li!*—upon entering the world, nature separates into the heart, life into the kidneys. These two, though only eight inches and four fen apart, never reunite in old age. When vitality peaks at the appointed time—around fifteen or sixteen years of age—the qi of the cinnabar field stirs naturally. The primordial treasure of wisdom-life, the primordial qi received from before heaven, undergoes transformation, and the mechanism of opening the pass and turning outward arises.",

Nature and life spiral and gather in the Central Palace, forming the Dao-embryo. This is the samādhi of peace and bliss. At this stage, nothing is lost or diminished—once attained, it is eternally realized.",

      "translated_text": "For the primordial qi concealed within the cinnabar field, when postnatal qi is sufficient, the prenatal qi stirs of itself. If this stirring is left unrefined, the Yang Pass opens outward, and it transforms into the leak-prone essence of the postnatal realm. To prevent its outward flow, seize this moment—this *mechanism*—where within appears a vision, and without, the outer kidneys stir. Turn the light inward, reflect it back, and concentrate the mind into the Northern Sea, so that the primordial treasure follows the mind’s return to the Northern Sea. As Master Jiwu said: \"Concentrate the spirit and draw it into this chamber, and qi will follow the spirit, naturally returning to this aperture.\" The World-Honored One also said: \"Where the mind and eyes reside.\" Thus it is called harmonizing and congealing. To unite the heart with the kidneys is called *congealing*. The reason it is said to have transformations of sequence and reversal is this: following the sequence, primordial essence becomes leak-prone; reversing it, primordial qi becomes the substance. Hence it is called *mechanism*. *Mechanism* means movement. Without calling it *mechanism*, people would not recognize the stirring of the treasure of wisdom-life. Now, life is primordial qi. Though its stirring does not leak, it still dissipates outward, and when exhausted—alas! The cultivator does not allow it to dissipate outward but gathers and stores it within, thereby accomplishing the Dao. All living beings are of this qi. Thus it is called the supreme treasure. To sit rigidly in dull emptiness—as today’s Chan practitioners, ignorant of wisdom-life, mistake dead sitting with gathered mind for the Dao—is mistaken. They lose the true mechanism of harmonizing nature and life. Not knowing the congealing of nature and life, they grind bricks to make mirrors—what benefit is there? Falling into withered stillness, with what will they produce the true seed? Without knowing the method of harmonizing and congealing, no vision of the true seed’s birth will appear. When the mechanism ceases, silent illumination is perfectly merged—this is called *Chan*. When the mechanism ceases, life does not stir, Yang does not rise—hence it is called the ceasing of the mechanism. Once the mechanism has ceased, turn the light inward in tranquil reflection, without affairs or action—this is called *Chan*. When the time arrives and it stirs suddenly, it is again called *mechanism*. Now, *time* does not mean the time of heaven and earth, but the time when the true seed is born. If one knows the method used previously, there will naturally come a time when the true seed is born. Swiftly gather and retrieve it, returning it to the original palace. If not retrieved, the opportunity is lost.",

      "translated_text": "Perfection and penetration are called \"stealthy attainment\"—*stealing* means *taking*. It arises from the ebb and flow of opening and closing. Opening and closing are the inner and outer breath; ebb and flow are the mechanism of the primordial pass. Moving the wheel of the primordial mechanism—this is the path by which the true seed courses through the *Ren* and *Du* meridians. Breath hastens its passage, hence it is called the wheel of the primordial mechanism. The true seed, the numinous treasure, should return to its root and be deeply concealed, stored in the lower *dantian*. The ancients called this *returning to the origin and restoring life*. Its circulation returns again to the original cavern of life. Yet having obtained this seed, it is through the mechanism of the wheel that one attains mastery—this is called *śarīra*. *Śarīra* is the refinement of life through the cultivation of nature, hence it is called *śarīra*. Abandon the effortful work, discard the method of wind-driven circulation. Employ the effortless method, turning the light inward in reflection. In silent stillness, illuminate it—this is again called *Chan*. This is the work of gathering *śarīra*, requiring seven days of illumination. This is called *the locus of heart and eye*—*locus* means the heart and eye rest upon the place of *śarīra*. Then the *maṇi* pearl forms, coalescing into one. Its shape is like cinnabar, its light like snow. Within, it is red; when it radiates, it is white. Molten as if smelted, sweet as honey. The *dantian* melts with warmth, the mouth as if filled with honey. Vivid and fluid, it flows forth—this is again called *mechanism*. *Forth* means issuing from the furnace. Without alarm or doubt, settle the mind in stillness. Await its movement and gather it, observing its motion to act in unison—this is truly the wondrous method and skillful means of gathering. Apart from this, there is no other way. It is said that the soft can overcome the hard. Seize this moment of movement—*movement* refers to the pearl’s motion. Gently it pierces through the threefold iron pass. *Gently* means neither ahead nor behind; ahead is called guiding and deviant practices, behind is called visualization and heterodox paths. Thus, it must proceed in mutual dependence. *Threefold* refers to the spine’s ascent, with apertures on either side through which it rises straight upward. This is called *transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood*. Refining *śarīra* below the navel, once formed, it must transcend and depart the illusory realm—if it does not transcend, there will ultimately be affliction. The *maṇi* treasure-pearl having returned to the center—below the heart, above the kidneys—gently guard and steadily illuminate it, this is again called *Chan*. Continuously nurture it. Within *Chan* concentration, there is the bliss of effortless harmony—a mass of supreme harmony’s heavenly principle, as if intoxicated or suffused with fragrance. The Buddha called this the *samādhi* within *Chan* concentration. Yet within effortlessness, there suddenly arises effort—this is again called *mechanism*. A drop of sweet dew in the vast emptiness. Now, if it is called effortless, why again speak of *mechanism*? If not for *mechanism*, one would not know of this wondrous thing, remaining alone within the womb, unaware of the Dao, for heaven and humanity have a mutually assisting mechanism. Following this wondrous thing of mechanism, gather and attach it to the embryo, guiding it with intention back to the central palace. In tranquil illumination, prolong its concentration—this is again called *Chan*. As before, nurture it. This is called *birth and extinction extinguished*. The two *qi* are eternally settled. Within the stillness of concentration, a thing suddenly transcends and emerges—this is again called *mechanism*. It comes from the *dantian*, possessing radiance but no form, suspended in the vast emptiness. Wait patiently for it—this is again called *Chan mechanism*. After two or three breaths, it emerges again—this is again called *mechanism*. It too comes from the *dantian*, possessing radiance but no form, merging with the previous thing. Gather and conceal it. Employ the secret heavenly mechanism, withdrawing the hand into the womb. In tranquil illumination, gently and silently guard it—this is again called *Chan*. Without affairs in effortlessness, constantly still yet constantly aware. Within tranquil illumination and gentle silence, two things emerge from the *yongquan* points—this is again called *mechanism*. Two paths of pure Yang things ascend straight from the *yongquan* to the crown, then descend to the central palace. Gather and settle them in stillness—this is again called *Chan*. The nose ceases exhalation, the six pulses are all at peace. This is called *quiescent extinction*, leaving no trace of entry or exit. When the concentration of quiescent extinction endures, flurries of white snow fill the void—this is again called *mechanism*. At this time, discern the mechanism of emerging from concentration.

The Great Dao is the dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*, the method of subduing the Dragon and Tiger. To cultivate *xing* alone in desiccated solitude is not the Great Dao.\n\nPast affinities are the merits accumulated over countless kalpas, by which one is fortunate in this life to encounter dual cultivation. For example, Zhu Tu was a virgin youth, secluded in a lofty chamber within a wealthy household, unable to seek the Dao. By chance, he encountered one who conveyed the subtle message, received my guidance, and attained the fruition of the Dao—such was his prior cause.\n\nDuring the Jin dynasty, an ancestral master left this record: *\"In the year exceeding one thousand four hundred, the virgin youth Zhu Tu will sweep the path in welcome.\"* Was this not the predetermined result of past cultivation? One must then swiftly emerge from concentration, lest retrogressive thoughts arise.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"In that household, there is only him alone—how can he fail to bear a son to continue the lineage?\"*\nThe reply: *\"The Most High, the Tathāgata, and Kūṭāgārama all had sons.\"*\nAnother asked: *\"If the Dao is already accomplished, would bearing a child not leak and dissipate it?\"*\nThe reply: *\"Superior immortals and buddhas unite through spirit or *qi*; ordinary men cannot. To beget a child, they must unite in form, hence the leakage that injures their original essence. When the Tathāgata once departed for the mountains, his consort said: *'If you go, what shall I rely on later?'* The Tathāgata turned and pointed, saying: *'Later, you will bear a son.'* And indeed, she later gave birth to a son. Kūṭāgārama, the nineteenth patriarch of the Western Heaven, was invited by the Chinese emperor to expound the Dharma in this land. Afterward, he said to the king: *'This humble monk wishes to bear a son.'* The king then granted him palace women. At that time, all the monks were displeased.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Rāma, perceiving their sentiment, transformed and presented the king with needles to offer the assembly of monks. None dared partake, but Rāma alone consumed a bowlful. At that moment, he expounded the Dharma, saying: *\"He who eats the needle shall wed a wife; he who cannot eat the needle shall not wed a wife.\"* The following day, the needles emerged from every pore of his body, and later, he indeed bore a son. This is the dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*, the transformation of spiritual penetration. Having already attained the Dao, why fear bearing a child?\n\nSome enter through seeing, others through hearing, yet at the moment of accomplishment, all are one. The preceding passage speaks of those with roots cultivated over many lifetimes; this speaks of those who begin cultivation in this life—whether by seeing others practice and following suit, or by hearing of others’ practice and taking it up themselves. When merit is perfected and conduct fulfilled, it is the same as those who came before. This is what is meant by *\"awakening, and the sentient being becomes a buddha; deluded, and the buddha is but a sentient being.\"*\n\nMoreover, it depends on the power of a discerning and resolute mind. All who study the Dao must possess a spark of spiritual awakening; one cannot rely solely on the words of others but must trust in one’s own insight. Do not be misled by heterodox paths or enamored of minor practices. The steadfast, upon seeing heterodox paths or minor practices, will naturally remain unconfused and unmoved.\n\nHumbly empty the self and reverently seek out lofty persons of resolve; diligently seek out teachers. Do not cling to sectarian divisions—all Three Teachings have hidden masters. When you encounter one, immediately seek the Dao; do not fixate on superficial traces. Search through the ancient sayings, seek a teacher to awaken the Dao, and use this to verify truth and falsehood. In the transmission of teachings, one must carefully examine each step to see whether the method aligns or not. Before receiving the oral instructions, one should first broadly study the scriptures of the Three Teachings, searching for the essential truths. When meeting a teacher, observe whether their teaching accords with the dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*. If the sequence is inverted, it is not the true Dao, and even if practiced, it will yield no benefit. Only if the instructions are genuine may one proceed and succeed.\n\nHow can one recognize genuine instructions? The Dao, when first undertaken, must be dual cultivation. With each step taken, there will be corresponding verification. Do not be swayed by old habits—old habits are the actions and tendencies of the past; today, they do not arise or manifest, for the mind is refined through effort. Do not be assailed by demonic obstructions. Those who study the Dao will encounter a measure of demonic obstruction for every measure of effort—whether inner or outer demons. A single true thought, concealed within *ming*, remains still and unmoving, for the mind’s refinement is complete. Doubt vanishes at once, and the true mind abides.\n\nHaving received the true oral instructions from a genuine teacher, press forward with courage and vigor, maintaining the true thought in every moment as the master of the Dao. Past, present, and future become undifferentiated—no thought of the future, no attachment to the past, no delight in the present. The three minds are forgotten, and the celestial principle is whole. Perceiving things, the inner self awakens and does not stray—just as the Sixth Patriarch said, *\"Seeing things, the mind swiftly arises.\"* Hearing sounds, the inner self remains steadfast and does not waver. As the *Heart Sutra* explains: *\"Let the world’s affairs churn in chaos; the master of the hall remains at peace all day.\"*\n\nBright as the sun at midday, the twelve hours are illuminated by an unwavering spark of spiritual light. Silent and luminous, the reflection returns in stillness—within the tranquility of concentration, the light turns back to illuminate the northern sea. The eight winds cannot shake it—eye, ear, nose, tongue, and mind remain unmoved, hence the \"eight winds.\" Then the great Dao may be hoped for. Cultivating the mind in this way, then undertaking the practice, one will see effects, and the Dao will surely be attainable. If the mind is not refined, the practice will yield no effects, and the Dao will not be achieved.\n\nThe supreme Dao does not proceed in isolation; it requires companions to uphold and protect it. If strength is weak and *qi* feeble, nothing will be accomplished. Strength here refers to wealth. Without resources, even with the method, merit is difficult to perfect. The Sixth Patriarch relied on the offerings of Chan Master Shenhui; the twenty-seventh patriarch received the king’s wealth through incense. The two kinds of giving are equal, both aiding in the completion of the Dao.\n\nYet to amass gold beyond measure, to pile wealth like mountains, and still not believe in the path to buddhahood—choosing instead to remain a ghost—how is this worthy? One must rely on those of virtue to return together to awakening. Virtue is most difficult to attain; one must possess the heart-mind of the buddhas and patriarchs to be truly virtuous in the Dao. When the Sixth Patriarch was nearing Shaozhou, he encountered Liu Zhilüe and formed a friendship with him. This was a shared awakening, the virtue of the Dao.\n\nTo discern the truth or falsehood of companions and protectors, one must observe their dispositions over time. A person’s goodness or evil will naturally reveal itself with the passage of days. Some are driven by a desire for superiority—pleased when praised, displeased when criticized—such people are unfit to study the Dao. Others pursue merit through contrived deeds—reciting scriptures, bowing to buddhas, building bridges, repairing roads, renovating temples, or receiving precepts—all merely seeking worldly blessings, irrelevant to the Dao. As the Sixth Patriarch said, *\"Even with blessings, karmic obstacles remain\"*—how can one seek such things?\n\nSome cling to their own abilities, believing themselves capable without resolve. Others claim buddhas and patriarchs are born enlightened, that ordinary beings cannot receive the true transmission. Little do they know that the great Dao is within everyone’s reach. With such people, do not reveal the mechanism. When encountering these four types, not a word should be spoken.\n\nSome value wealth over righteousness—those who prize wealth lack benevolence and cannot bear the Dao. Some begin with enthusiasm but do not persevere—sweet at first, bitter in the end. Some speak kindly but harbor malice—cultivating a reputation for show. Some are obsequious and deceptive—small-minded people who feign humility to advance. Some come from families without virtue—if ancestors lacked virtue, even if descendants cultivate, Heaven will not bestow the Dao upon them.",

      "translated_text": "**Six Questions Clearly Answered**\n\n**First Question:** Why does one not attain the Dao despite worshipping the Buddha?\n**Answer:** The Buddha resides in the vast emptiness—what need is there to worship? The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: *\"If one sees me in form, or seeks me in sound, such a person walks the wrong path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"*\n\n**Further Question:** Then is worship of no use?\n**Answer:** Worship is merely an expression of sincerity; it has no bearing on the Dao.\n\n**Second Question:** Why does one not attain the Dao despite reciting sūtras?\n**Answer:** Sūtras are the Buddha’s compositions. If one recites them for the Buddha to hear, why would he need to listen? If one recites them for oneself to hear, there is no need to do so in such a manner. The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: *\"If one seeks me in sound, such a person walks the wrong path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"* The Buddha is but a name among Westerners, just as Confucius is a surname among the Chinese. What offense has the Buddha committed that you must recite his name? It is like an examination candidate hoping to place first by chanting the sage’s surname—would that suffice? The Sixth Patriarch said: *\"Easterners commit sins and recite the Buddha’s name to be reborn in the West; if Westerners commit sins and recite the Buddha’s name, where then shall they be reborn?\"* What benefit does recitation bring to the Dao?\n\n**Third Question:** Why does one not attain the Dao despite receiving the precepts?\n**Answer:** The precepts are prohibitions. After attaining the Dao, the Tathāgata, seeing his followers were many, had Mañjuśrī request that he establish these precepts as a means to restrain the lower-minded and prevent disorder. The Sixth Patriarch said: *\"With a peaceful mind, what need is there to uphold precepts?\"* The great Dao resides within one’s nature and life, while these precepts lie on the surface—skin and hair. The two are not in harmony, so no attainment is possible.\n\n**Fourth Question:** The *Seven-Day Retreat* is now regarded in the Buddhist teachings as the supreme method, yet no one attains the Dao through it. Instead, practitioners often cough up blood—why is this?\nSince the Tathāgata’s dispensation, neither the twenty-eight patriarchs of the Western Heavens nor the six generations of the Eastern Land ever practiced this method. It was fraudulently devised by a disciple of the monk Gaofeng, ensnaring later generations. Gaofeng was a scholar of texts, not a follower of the Tathāgata’s Dao. Moreover, what is practiced is merely a side method of breath restraint. Those who cough up blood do so because kneeling for incense and suppressing breath harms the viscera, while sitting through incense and meals injures the spine. Even if Lü and Bian Que were present, they could not save them. In time, a perfected one will arise to abolish this method and rescue countless lives.\n\n**Fifth Question:** Some who practice the *Seven-Day Retreat* claim to have suddenly awakened to their Buddha-nature, yet they cough up blood and still teach others to practice it. Have they truly awakened to Buddha-nature?\n**Answer:** *Hua Yang* laughs heartily: *\"Those who have attained the Dao enjoy unimpeded circulation through all channels, a single mass of harmonious yang qi, with no obstruction from yin qi. Those who cough up blood suffer from disharmony between yin and yang, excess fire, and blocked yin qi. Their lives are in peril—how could they have awakened to Buddha-nature? The truth is self-evident without need for debate.\"*\n\n**Sixth Question:** The Sixth Patriarch, upon hearing the sūtra, suddenly awakened to *\"no abiding, yet giving rise to the mind.\"* Why then did he seek the Fifth Patriarch?\n**Answer:** What the Sixth Patriarch awakened to was the Dao of nature. Knowing he possessed the Dao of wisdom-life, he traveled thousands of miles to seek the master’s grace and receive its transmission. For wisdom-life must be transmitted by a teacher; empty awakening alone cannot attain it.\n\n**Six Questions from Scholar Li Sibai of Jieyi, whose courtesy name is Yu, and Daoist name is Jade Jade**\n\n**First Question:** Formerly, this disciple held no faith in Buddhism or Daoism. Having heard Master Zhu’s words that the teachings of Buddhism and Daoism are empty and insubstantial, I rejected them entirely. Later, a friend sent me one of the Master’s books. Initially, I had no desire to read it, but upon forcing myself to do so, I discovered true and substantial practice within. My faith became unwavering. After half a month of cultivation, I was fortunate to witness the manifestation of the true seed, feeling the eight channels within my body open all at once. Long-standing illnesses vanished in a single night, and now I form śarīra—what great fortune! This disciple has heard that today’s monastics, upon opening their mouths, claim to have awakened to their nature without need for cultivation, asserting that cultivation, once accomplished, will decay. Are these words true?\n**Answer:** Such claims are merely schemes for clothing and food. Fearing others might say they lack the Dao and thus lose their patrons, they employ deceptive tactics—where is there any truth in it? If cultivation were unnecessary, why did the World-Honored One spend six years on Snow Mountain? Why did Bodhidharma sit nine years at Shaolin? Why did the Sixth Patriarch seclude himself for fifteen years? All have their evidence. Those who speak of sudden awakening are but deceiving the world! When their breath ceases, they will be gone!\n\n**Second Question:** Is the cultivation of the Dao accomplished through one method or two?\n**Answer:** The myriad buddhas all follow a single method. Before obtaining wisdom-life, there are distinctions of schools and lineages; once wisdom-life is attained, all return to one. As the World-Honored One said: *\"Excluding duality, it is not the true.\"*\n\n**Third Question:** Are the Dharma transmissions in today’s Chan schools genuine? Furthermore, when a monastic becomes an abbot, they no longer need to seek others but become a great monk, ascend the Buddha’s seat, and preach the Dharma on his behalf. What Dharma is this?\n**Answer:** From the Western Heavens to the Eastern Land, from Bodhidharma to the Sixth Patriarch, transmission was passed mouth-to-ear, mind-to-mind. The Fifth Patriarch said: *\"Masters secretly transmit the original sound.\"* Now, the true transmission is lost, replaced by written records bearing the names of certain monks as Dharma-heirs. It is like actors claiming to be Emperor Gaozu or King Xiang Yu, or cowherds singing folk songs—fooling the ignorant and simple-minded. The wise see through it and can only laugh.\n\n**Fourth Question:** Is *kanhua* Chan—\"observing the keyword\"—the true Dao?",

      "translated_text": "**Answer:** This is but a side door of the Buddhist teaching. Thus, \"observing the keyword\" in Chan is merely a contest of one’s own superiority. As for the true Dao of the Buddhist teaching, one must first cultivate both aspects in tandem, putting genuine effort into practice—without inquiring after \"keywords.\"\n\n**Fifth Question:** When a seated meditator experiences leakage, what is the cause?\n**Answer:** By fifteen or sixteen, qi naturally overflows and leaks—yet without receiving the true transmission, one does not know how to apply the fire-cultivation. Without mastery of fire-cultivation, how can there be any principle of self-containment? To prevent leakage, one must constantly apply the fire to refine the point of leakage, transmuting essence into qi so that it ascends upward instead of leaking away.\n\n**Sixth Question:** Today’s Chan practitioners claim that leakage does not hinder Dao-cultivation. Is this correct?\n**Answer:** This is the foremost heresy. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"Those who do not sever the lustful body, lustful mind, and lustful root will inevitably fall into demonic paths, unable to escape for a hundred thousand kalpas.\" Moreover, one instance of leakage is no different in principle from one instance of coupling with an ordinary person. No Buddha or patriarch in the heavens has ever had a leaking body—so whence would their śarīra come? Such are the lowest of the Buddhist followers; they are not worth discussing.\n\n**Thirteen Questions of Monk Zhenyuan**\n**First Question:** Where does one begin with the true Dao?",
      "overlap_context": "transmission was passed mouth-to-ear, mind-to-mind. The Fifth Patriarch said: *\"Masters secretly transmit the original sound.\"* Now, the true transmission is lost, replaced by written records bearing the names of certain monks as Dharma-heirs. It is like actors claiming to be Emperor Gaozu or King Xiang Yu, or cowherds singing folk songs—fooling the ignorant and simple-minded. The wise see through it and can only laugh.\n\n**Fourth Question:** Is *kanhua* Chan—\"observing the keyword\"—the true Dao?",

      "translated_text": "**Answer:** Where the mind and eyes rest—also called \"concentrated harmony\"—one must know there is a wondrous place of abiding. As the ancients said: \"Inward reflection and concentrated union reveal the destination—it lies precisely where life resides.\"\n\n**Second Question:** When does one begin?\n**Answer:** When the substance is present, then one begins. The patriarchs said: \"Precious is the natural substance, solitary and without companion.\" It is neither mind nor thought, but the substance concealed within the sea; when it stirs, awareness arises—this is the moment to begin.\n\n**Third Question:** The ancients spoke of \"subduing the dragon and taming the tiger.\" What are the dragon and tiger?\n**Answer:** The dragon is the numinous thought within the mind, while the tiger is the warm sign within the sea of qi. To subdue dragon and tiger, first let the dragon dwell in the tiger’s den, then let the tiger return to the dragon’s cave—thus is their natural subjugation achieved.\n\n**Fourth Question:** What is meant by \"the fierce tiger leaving the forest\"?\n**Answer:** It is the stirring of the yang substance.\n**Further Question:** How is it subdued?\n**Answer:** By driving it with the dragon and fanning it with the wind.\n\n**Fifth Question:** What is the true seed?\n**Answer:** When dragon and tiger are refined into one substance, and the mechanism stirs, it is called the true seed.\n\n**Sixth Question:** What is the *śarīra*?\n**Answer:** It is what the true seed produces through the refining method of the Dharma-wheel, such that the external kidneys no longer rise—hence the name *śarīra*.\n\n**Seventh Question:** What is the *maṇi*-pearl?\n**Answer:** It is what the *śarīra* produces through the method of moving past the three posterior barriers and returning to the central palace—hence the name *maṇi*-pearl. As the ancients said: \"Three before, three after\"—this is it.\n\n**Eighth Question:** What is the Dao-embryo?\n**Answer:** When the *maṇi*-pearl returns to the central palace and unites with intent, with intent dwelling within the pearl as iron is drawn to a magnet—this is called the Dao-embryo.\n\n**Ninth Question:** What are the six supernormal powers?\n**Answer:** First, the power of the exhaustion of outflows is perfected; then the five powers arise. If one cultivates only nature and ignores the wisdom-life, only the five powers are attained, and the exhaustion of outflows cannot be perfected. Lacking this one power, one cannot become a Buddha but remains a wandering spirit, transmigrating through kalpas.\n\n**Tenth Question:** What is \"emerging from samādhi\"?\n**Answer:** When the pearl within the Dao-embryo is refined into oneness and, upon completion, emerges from the crown of the head.\n\n**Eleventh Question:** What is the transformation body?\n**Answer:** It is the body transformed after emerging from samādhi.\n**Further Question:** What is the method of transformation?\n**Answer:** Like the movement of the ten fingers of a hand—whether one finger moves or all ten move, it is entirely a matter of intention.\n\n**Twelfth Question:** When secondary practices and the true Dao reach completion, what are the signs?\n**Answer:** Those who claim success in secondary practices do so with empty talk, without evidence or basis. When the true Dao produces *śarīra*, the external kidneys cease all movement. When the Dao-embryo is formed, the six pulses in the hands vanish, white hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow, and upon emerging from samādhi, a body appears outside the body—those who seek a teacher should examine these signs for themselves.\n\n**Thirteenth Question:** If one does not attain the true Dao, what becomes of them in the future?\n**Answer:** Plant melons and you get melons; plant beans and you get beans.\n\n**Question from the Abbot of Taiyi Haihui Monastery, Longjiang:** If one cultivates in stillness alone, without arising stray thoughts, can one avoid leakage and perfect the power of the exhaustion of outflows?\n**Answer:** Stillness cultivation only severs lustful body and lustful conduct, but not the lustful root. Since the root is not severed, the exhaustion of outflows cannot be perfected. To perfect the exhaustion of outflows, one must employ the work of fire and wind. The Tathāgata spoke of \"fire transformation\" and \"wind fanning\"—there is indeed a true transmission.\n\n**Abbot Shizang of the Yaoshi Cloister in Hongdu**",
