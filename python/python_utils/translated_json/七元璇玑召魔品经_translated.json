Author unknown. Two scriptures share this scroll.\n\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\nThe *Scripture of the Seven Primordials’ Celestial Mechanism for Summoning Demons*\n\nThe Seven Perfected addressed the Five Elders and Supreme August One, saying: \"Heaven possesses three *qi*, governing the Three Supreme Heavens. The first is called the Pure Tenuity Treasure Heaven; the second, the Yu-Yu Primordial Heaven; the third, the Great Vermilion Central Heaven. From the Highest Azure Heaven down to the Central Heaven, the world of men calls them the Three Clarities. The true *qi* congeals and coalesces, all presiding over the Three Caverns, transforming and nurturing the human realm, subduing the hundred evils. Those among mortals who seek blessings all come to this.\n\nThe twenty-eight lunar lodges array themselves, and from them, the ninefold divine *qi* of the Central August descends to suffuse the human body, nourishing and sustaining the people. Above, they become the Nine Stellar Perfected Lords. All favor longevity and possess the Dao of deathlessness, which reaches its ultimate here. Above, they are called the Nine Paths, all arranged in the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, each bearing the true talismans of the nine paths.\n\nLet later disciples wear and transmit these, for they greatly command ghosts and spirits, overturn heaven and earth, and subdue evil demons. Above, they aid the state and relieve calamities; below, they provide methods to govern and deliver the people. In the first year of the Dragon Han era, the year *jiawu*, the Heavenly Worthy expounded the method of the Northern Emperor for slaying demons and annihilating spirits, instructing the heavenly beings to cultivate it. Thus emerged the *Three-Five Step Net* and the *Regulation of the Celestial Discipline*, the *Seven Primordials’ True Talismans of the Vast Expanse*, and the *Primordial Spirit Contract*—collectively called the *True Contract and Treasure Chapters for Annihilating Demons*.\n\nThese were transmitted to the Celestial Master, enabling the people to escape the affliction of untimely death and attain the wondrous source of longevity. At that time, the Five Elders received the mandate, bowed their heads, and entreated to hold the divine talismans, uphold the scripture to save the world, and dared not divulge them. They were to deliver all beings, freeing them from calamity, severing all perverse delusions, and guiding them into the source of our Dao.\n\nThus, the nine true talismans and numinous chapters are arrayed and transmitted to this day. If a Daoist devotes heart and mind single-mindedly to this method, serving as a libationer to govern the people and universally deliver all sentient beings into the wondrous Dao, ghosts and spirits will flee. Should a household afflicted by illness come to summon you, immediately establish a Daoist sanctuary and light lamps. First, inscribe the nine talismans and place them upon the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams to protect the dwelling and repel demons—then the illness will naturally heal. Myriad ghosts and two spirits, along with the *wangliang* within the house, will flee a thousand *li*. Benevolent spirits will augment their guard, and the officials of the Three Bureaus and Nine Courts will all receive the prohibitions and admonitions.\"\n\nThe primordial essence flows as blessings, and every thirty years it is to be transmitted to one person. Whoever obtains it will see all methods come to fruition. If recklessly divulged to the foolish, the walking corpses, or the kings of the three lower realms, calamity will befall nine generations, and they shall be eternally enslaved to the ghostly officials. Later disciples of the Dao must take heed and reverently practice.\n\nThe Seven Perfected say: In my past observations of the Three Realms, all were thrown into chaos by demonic and spectral disturbances. Hearts turned to malice, unable to enter the wondrous source of eternal life, their wandering souls cast beyond the material world, ensnared by ghostly demons. Alas, alas! All sentient beings are lost in the delusion of lesser spirits.\n\nNow, I reveal the talismans of the numinous officials to later disciples, to sever demonic influences, interrogate ghosts, cure illnesses, and assist the celestial rectification of *qi*. Diligently follow the master’s teachings without transgression: inscribe talismans for suppression, recite scriptures, perform the Daoist rites, and present memorials. I declare that when inscribing talismans to heal illness, maintain equanimity and a single mind, compassionately aiding all who seek help. After the Three Dragons, devote yourself earnestly to exhorting sentient beings to receive the scriptures, uphold the Dharma, and seek the Dao under a master’s guidance. Renounce all worldly glory, focus solely on this method, and serve your master as though standing before the throne.\n\nThe Seven Perfected proclaim to the great demons of all heavens and the five emperors, along with all demon kings: After the Three, Nine, Five, and Seven cycles, you shall assist Daoist priests in traversing the lands, healing all illnesses, and subduing all demonic forces throughout the world, preventing them from harming the virtuous. Should any stubborn spirits or malevolent specters violate my prohibitions, they shall be delivered to Fengdu to be punished and executed. Those who aid the Daoist priests in their transformative work shall receive numinous responses.\n\nThe Seven Perfected say: Later disciples fortunate enough to encounter me within the Three Realms—where the thirty-six heavens of celestial numina and earthly sages, along with the Three Officials they serve, inscribe blessings in the Hall of Fortune, and where demon kings elevate the worthy to the rank of Immortal Kings—after the Three Dragons, must adhere to the regulations and transmit this teaching to one person every thirty years. If none are found, inscribe a copy and conceal it within a renowned mountain, where it shall be revered by the immortals and attended by earthly deities. At the time of attaining the Dao, you shall ascend through the Golden Gate.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Seven Primordials’ Jade Mechanism for Summoning Demons* concludes.",
