  "full_translation": "**Gold Talisman Ritual for Opening the Hall**\n*Sutra Title: Ritual for Opening the Hall of the Gold Talisman*\n*One scroll. Compiled by Du Guangting of the Late Tang and Five Dynasties period.*\n*Source text: The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era (正统道藏), under the \"Taoist Rituals\" (洞玄部) – Category of *威仪 (Ritual Etiquette).*\n\n**Ritual of the Gold Talisman Hall**\n*Collected by Master Guangcheng Du Guangting*\n\n**Preface to the Ritual**\n\nThe Most High possesses the *Three Primordial Talismans of Simplicity* (三元简文), universally spreading benevolence and salvation, bestowing blessings upon both the living and the dead, and granting life and death their due. The *Gold Talisman of the Upper Primordial* (上元金箓) is for sovereigns and kings, to stabilize the state and safeguard the people, to preserve the land and protect all life, to dispel celestial calamities and avert earthly disasters, to govern the fate of the age and bring tranquility to mountains and rivers, to subdue demons and banish malevolent forces. Should the Five Stars stray from their courses, the Four Seasons falter, the Two Celestial Symbols (日月) be unsettled, eclipses occur, the heavens tilt and the earth tremble, rivers dry up and mountains collapse, floods and droughts bring ruin, locusts and pests devastate crops, pestilence spreads, wars erupt, ferocious beasts attack, floods and fires rage, thunder strikes in winter and snow falls in summer, comets and portents appear—all these call for the establishment of a *Gold Talisman Ritual Hall* (金录宝斋) on sacred mountains, ancient grottoes, or divine precincts, with meticulous devotion and strict adherence to ritual protocols.\n\nThrough supplication to Heaven and gratitude for blessings, through self-examination and repentance, through sincere devotion to the Dao and invocation of divine aid, one may dispel malevolent influences and mitigate disasters. Only through utmost sincerity, exhaustive effort, and unwavering devotion can one achieve divine resonance and response.\n\nAs the scriptures declare:\n*\"The Supreme Treasure of the Great Vehicle* (灵宝大乘) *universally saves both heavenly and human beings, bestowing blessings upon all, granting mercy to the living and the departed. The Imperial Scriptures in grand characters* (皇文大字) *transcend mortal limits, invoking divine presence and descending blessings. The Three Caverns’ Sacred Scriptures* (三洞宝经) *are the natural celestial texts, all containing methods for transcending the body and ascending to the Dao.*\n\nThose who practice them ride celestial dragons, ascending to the heavens in broad daylight; those who uphold them escape the Eight Hardships and avoid all suffering, attaining rebirth in the Pure Lands of the Seven Ancestors; those who witness them with devoted faith cultivate auspicious karmic connections in this life.\n\nIf one performs the ritual with clarity and strict adherence to the prescribed forms, one will immediately invoke the prohibitions of the Highest Dao.\n\n**Ritual Procedures Follow Below:**\n*The Gold Talisman Altar (金箓坛)*\n\n**Altar Construction and Ritual Arrangements**\n\n**Altar Dimensions and Structure**\nThe outer altar measures **4.5 zhang (丈) wide and 2 chi (尺) high**.\nThe middle altar measures **3.3 zhang wide and 2 chi high**.\nThe inner altar measures **2.4 zhang wide and 2 chi high**.\nThe square altars collectively stand **6 chi tall**, adhering to the **Kun (坤) configuration**.\n\n**Pillars (纂) and Gates**\nThe main altar has **ten gates**, using **twelve long pillars (长纂)** and **eight short pillars (短纂)**.\nThe middle altar uses **eight long pillars** and **eight short pillars**.\nThe **Eight Trigrams Pillars (八卦纂)**, eight in number, are placed outside the altar—four at the corners and four at the cardinal directions.\n\nIn total, **thirty-eight long pillars (each 1 zhang long, protruding 9 chi from the ground)** and **thirty short pillars (each 7 chi long, protruding 6 chi from the ground)** are used.\nAll **sixty-eight pillars** are **8 cun (寸) in circumference**, with long pillars painted in alternating **black and white sections (five each)**, and short pillars in **three black and three white sections**.\n\n**Pillar Preparation**\nPillars are made by binding **bamboo strips (100 bundles of 150 *máng* each)** with **black ink (two *tīng* of

altar (4 chi mats)**: **Sixteen sets of clean rush mats**.\n- **Middle altar (5 chi mats)**: **Twelve sets of clean rush mats**, with **self-made clean felt cushions**.\n- A **long mat and narrow rush mat** encircles the outer altar.\n- A **high seat** is placed at the altar’s center for scripture invocation.\n- A **lower table** to the south holds incense and fire offerings.\n- **Five tables** are placed at the four cardinal gates and center.\n- **Three tables** inside the scripture hall hold **three sets of incense and fire offerings**.\n- **Five sheets of blue paper** with **Five Directions True Scriptures (五方真文)** (from *Yù Jué Shàng Juàn*) are placed on the five-directional tables.\n- **Five golden dragons** are positioned over the Five Directions True Scriptures.\n- **Five incense burners and five censers** are placed on the tables.\n- **Five lacquered boxes** hold **Five Directions patterned silks**, placed beneath the incense tables.\n- A **table for the ritual master’s natal pattern silk** is set before the Triple Jewel Seat, to the left.\n\n**Lamp Lighting Regulations**\n- **Spring**: Light **nine lamps**, or **ninety**, or **nine hundred**.\n- **Summer**: Light **three lamps**, or **thirty**, or **three hundred**.\n- **Autumn**: Light **seven lamps**, or **seventy**, or **seven hundred**.\n- **Winter**: Light **five lamps**, or **fifty**, or **five hundred**.\n- **Month of Ping (平)**: Light **twelve lamps**, or **one hundred twenty**, or **one thousand two hundred**.\n\nLamps are arranged outside the altar in **nine directional clusters (36 total)** as per tradition.\nA **long lamp (1.9 zhang tall, protruding from the ground)** with **nine lamps** is placed inside the inner altar near the Triple Jewel Seat to **illuminate the Nine Dark Realms**.\n**One hundred fifty-six lamps** are arranged in the courtyard, with **seven additional candles** for nighttime use.\n\n**Silk Offerings for Disaster Aversion**\n- **Five-colored patterned silks** are used for exorcism and deliverance.\n  - **Emperor**: *Zhǐ* (疋) measure.\n  - **Nobles**: *Zhàng* (丈) measure.\n  - **Commoners**: *Màn* (缦) measure.\n  - **East (青纹)**: Nine sections.\n  - **South (绛纹)**: Three sections.\n  - **West (白纹)**: Seven sections.\n  - **North (皂纹)**: Five sections.\n  - **Center (黄纹)**: Twelve sections.\n\nFor **nobles and marquises**, each year of life adds one *zhang* to the silk offering, matching the color of their lifespan.\n\nAdditionally, on their birth-year day, the **Emperor** must use **purple-patterned silk**, increasing by one *zhǐ* annually. **Nobles** also use purple-patterned silk, increasing by one *zhang* each year. **Commoners** use *màn* silk, increasing by one *shǐ* annually.\n\nFor offerings:\n- **Cash**: 24,000 (or 12,000, or 2,400).\n- **Rice**: 12 *hú* (or 2 *dòu*).\n- **Oil**: 120 *jīn* (or 12 *jīn*).\n\nFive **golden dragons**, each weighing one *liǎng*, must be used:\n- The **Emperor** employs **superior gold**,\n- **Princes and nobles** use **secondary gold**,\n- **Commoners** use **inferior gold**.\nAfter the rites, these are cast into rivers or mountains.\n\nFor **Dao practitioners**:\n- The **Emperor** requires **28 attendants**,\n- **Princes and nobles** need **16**,\n- **Commoners** require **14**.\nThis is because those who cultivate the **Dao-heart** are rare, and few can endure the **meritorious fields**. If there are **diligent practitioners**, their numbers should be adjusted according to rank.\n\nFor example, with **14 practitioners** conducting a **three-day Dao ritual**:\n- **Incense**: 4 *shēng* of harmonized fragrance,\n- **Incense balls**: 300,\n- **Fresh five-colored flowers**: 4 *shēng*, stored in **flower boxes**.\nAfter recitation, these are distributed.\n- **Handkerchiefs**: 4, hung before the **fasting hall**.\n\n**Perfumed bathwater** is also required—one *hú* per person, with **two bath towels** hung outside the chamber. The latrine must be **clean and concealed**, not exposed.\n\nUpon completion of the fast, a **yellow-white silk tablet** of five *chǐ* must be inscribed.\n\nThe **duration of Dao practice** follows the scriptures:\n- **Spring**: 9 days,\n- **Autumn**: 7 days,\n- **Summer**: 3 days,\n- **Winter**: 5 days,\n- **All seasons**: 12 days.\nIt is also said that the number of days should suit the practitioner’s capacity. Even if only **three days and nights** are spent with **sincere devotion**, the merits will still be profound. The fast’s conclusion requires offering the **golden dragons** and distributing **Dharma gifts** as per the scriptures.\n\nThe above are the **required ritual implements**. If anything is missing, refer to the scriptures for clear stipulations—nothing may be omitted lightly. Once the fast’s term is complete, follow the separate procedures.\n\nAfter the final day, **burn the true scriptures**. Beyond three days, present the **tablet of thanks** and conclude with gratitude before dismantling the altar and records.\n\n---\n**Hosting the Ritual**\nWhen the **preliminary rites** are complete, offerings are made in order of rank. All participants must **bathe, anoint with fragrance**, and wear **clean ritual robes**, arranging the **platform and seats** strictly according to the **Way**.\n\nThe **playground** is arranged before the **playground master**, with **clerks** listing their ranks and duties. The assembly is announced with **bell and chime**, and all within and without observe solemn silence.\n\nThe **fasting master** presents the **ritual petition**, whether for the **state by a great minister** or by **imperial decree**. Subordinates submit petitions in **sealed cases**, and the master receives them in the proper order.\n\nThe sequence follows:\n1. **Three Refuges Chant**,\n2. **Praise of the Chinese Realm**,\n3. **Invitation of the Three Teachers**,\n4. **Circumambulation to the Earthly Gate and Forbidden Altar**,\n5. **Gate-Opening Incantation**,\n6. **Ascending the Central Altar’s Heavenly Gate**,\n7. **Offering Five-Directional Incense** (day: east, night: north),\n8. **Offering Incense to the Imperial Tablet**,\n9. **Secrecy Incantation for Incense**,\n10. **Offering Incense to the Native Position**,\n11. **Each pays homage to the Master**, storing thoughts as per the **Lingbao Ritual**,\n12. **Twenty-four strikes of the Dharma drum**,\n13. **Lighting the censer**, each invoking their **Dharma station**.\n\n「With the **Dharma stations** complete, the **subordinate officials** solemnly perform the **Golden Talisman Great Fast Ritual**. The **subordinates**, including the present and past petitioners, offer incense on behalf of the **land and grain**, the **Sacred Ancestral Tablets**, the **august Emperor**, the **Empress and Crown Prince**, the **noble Princes and Princesses**, the **officials within and beyond the court**, and the **people of all lands**, great and small, that they may **return body, spirit, and command** to the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Ten Directions**, the **Limitless Great Lingbao Heavenly Sovereign**.\n\nMay all **prayers** that the **heavens be clear and the earth tranquil**, that the **sun and moon shine with purity**, that **all nations live in harmony**, that **all beings flourish in prosperity**, that the **Nine Abysses** rest in peace, that **eternal darkness be dispelled with light**, and that **one attains the Dao/Way’s truth**, transcending the **Three Realms**, to dwell in the **Limitless Golden Palace of the Seven Treasures and Purple Micro**, forever united with the Dao/Way. The **divine responses** invoked shall reach the **Supreme Most True Limitless Dao/Way**.\n\nThe sequence follows:\n1. **Homage to the Ten Directions**, beginning with the **north**,\n2. **Long kneeling and confession of sins**,\n3. The **subordinates** with sincere hearts **return body, spirit, and command** to the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Ten Directions**, the **Limitless Great Lingbao Heavenly Sovereign**.\n   In this **Great Fast Ritual**, the **subordinates** confess to the **Sacred Ancestral Tablets** and the **Heavenly Sovereigns**.\n   The **Emperor**, the **Empress**, the **Crown Prince**, the **noble Princes and Princesses**, and the **civil and military officials**, from the **beginningless kalpa** until today, have committed **endless transgressions** in **body, speech, and mind**. Now, at the **first watch of the night**, ascending the altar, and during the **morning confession**, we beseech the **Supreme Dao/Way** to **cleanse all sins**, great or small.\n   May the **Emperor’s ancestral temple** be **peaceful and enduring**, the **imperial lineage** **long-lasting and prosperous**, the **Emperor’s body** **eternally blessed**, and **all under heaven** **ascend to the realm of longevity**. May the **living and the dead** **receive blessings**, and all **creatures** **share in glory**. May **the Three Karmas** be **purified**, and the **Six Passions** **calmed**. All shall **rise to the shores of blessing** and **enter into the Dao/Way’s truth**.\n   With **sincere hearts**, we **bow in homage** to the **True Three Treasures**.\n   Next: **Three Refuges Chants**,\n   Next: **Three Homages**,\n   Next: **Circumambulating and reciting the Five-Directional True Scriptures**, beginning with the **east** and ending at the **central direction**, returning to the **Native Position**.\n   Offering incense, we **reaffirm the Dharma stations** and **invoke their True Scriptures**.\n   If it is the **birth anniversary**, use the **first section**.\n   If it is for **celestial calamities or stellar anomalies**, use the **second section**.\n   If it is for **demonic or spiritual plagues and epidemics**, use the **third section**.\n   If it is for **floods or excessive rain**, use the **fourth section**.\n   As prescribed in the **Jade Decision**, during the **Great Fast Ritual**, the **True Scriptures** are recited without the **Comprehensive Incantation**. The **Comprehensive Incantation** is used when **dismissing the altar**, and the **officials** recite it in unison.\n\n**Eastern Direction True Scripture**:\n   The **Eastern Direction**, the **Nine Qi** of the **Beginningless Sovereign**, the **Azure Heaven**. The **Emerald Mist** is **dense and layered**, within which sits the **Old Man**. He **oversees the celestial records**, **controls the breath of qi**, and **ascends as a transcendent**.\n\n**Southern Direction True Scripture**:\n   The **Southern Direction**, the **Red Heaven**, the **Hall of the Jade Emperor**. Within it dwells the **Great God**, named the **Red Sovereign**. The **flames ascend with smoke**, the **Three Qi** **burst forth in radiance**. The **Divine and Immortal** receive their **mandate**, responding to the **course of the Great Sun**.\n\n**Western Direction True Scripture**:\n   The **Western Direction**, the **White Heaven**, the **Seven Gates of the White Emperor**. The **Golden Spirit** **shines brightly**, the **Great Hua** **flows with mist**. The **White Stones** **rise majestically**, the **Seven Qi** **hover in vaporous abundance**. Above sits the **Firstborn Sovereign**, the **Great Old God**. He **oversees the lung qi**, **leads the Nine Heavens**. He **examines the celestial records**, **summons the transcendent**.\n\n**Northern Direction True Scripture**:\n   The **Northern Direction**, the **Dark Heaven**, the **Five Qi** **wandering**. Within it sits the **Black Emperor**, the **Double Sovereign of the Azure Micro**. He **oversees the talismans and mandates**, the **transcendents refining the Eight Auras**. In **green robes and feathered attire**, with **dragon script and phoenix garments**, the **Supreme Sovereign** **summons them** to the **Jade Stairs**.\n\n**Central Direction True Scripture**:\n   The **Central Direction**, the **Supreme Spirit**, the **Heavenly Sovereign**. The **Firstborn Five Old Ones**, the **Central Yellow High Sovereign**. He **controls the qi** and **supervises the truth**, **leads all beings**. He **records the mystic diagrams**, **hosts the jade scriptures**. He **guides the cosmic course** and **assists the divine breath**, **universally proclaiming to all spirits**.\n\nThe **High Functionary** with the **Dharma stations** complete, solemnly performs the **Golden Talisman Great Fast Ritual**. The **certain Mr. Certain** of the **Sacred Imperial Dao/Way**, the **subordinate officials**, humbly present this **petition** to the **Supreme Limitless Dao/Way**, the **Supreme Dao/Way Sovereign**, the **Supreme Old Sovereign**, the **Limitless Great Lingbao Heavenly Sovereign**, the **Great Saints of the Dao/Way** who have attained **Supreme Truth**, the **Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures**, the **Great Lawmaster of the Mystic Middle**, the **Heavenly Sovereign**, the **Supreme Minister and Supreme Overseer**, the **Four Officials and Five Emperors**, the **Three Realms’ officials**, and **all True Spirits**.\n\nThe **subordinates** hear that the **Supreme Dao/Way** **shines forth**, the **Three Vehicles** **govern the cosmic course**, and the **Sage** **manifests his teachings**. The **Three Talismans** **hang as decrees**, **assisting the world** and **securing the people**, **saving the age** and **propagating the doctrine**. They **protect the realm** and **uphold the Emperor**. For any **petition of sincerity**, it is **proper to submit** to the **Supreme Dao/Way**. We dare not **fail to present** our **words**.\n\nNext: **Reciting the Petition**\n   The **Emperor** has **inherited the divine blessings** and **received the auspicious mandate**, **continuing the heavenly rule** and **establishing the supreme pole**, **following the august lineage** and **governing the sacred times**, **seeking to spread the Dao/Way’s winds** and **bring peace to the people**. Yet he **fears** that the **people’s prosperity is not yet complete**, that **virtue and teaching are not yet trusted**. Sometimes **rewards and punishments** are **inappropriate**, and **laws and penalties** **fail in measure**. Sometimes the **yin and yang** are **disordered**, and the **sequence of qi** **falls out of harmony**. Only with **utter sincerity** do we **pray to the Supreme Dao/Way**.\n\nWe **contemplate** the **Heaven and Earth’s rulers**, who **oversee creation and transformation**, **governing the Three Realms’ True Spirits**. The **celestial officials** **reward the good** and **punish the evil**, **determine crimes** and **record merits**, **reaching the hidden and the manifest**, **striking great and small alike**. All **records and petitions** are **presented to the Supreme Dao/Way**. The **Heavenly Sovereign** **descends his compassionate gaze**, and the **Saints** **bestow their luminous blessings**. **Shadows follow voices**, and **all prayers are answered**.\n\nThus we **reverently establish the altar**, **devoutly observe the fast**, **concentrate our spirits** and **purify our thoughts**, **reform our conduct** and **calm our passions**. According to the **Golden Talisman’s clear scriptures** and the **True Science of the Upper Element**, at **certain location’s certain temple**, we **offer on behalf of the Emperor**, following the **ancient ritual norms**, **erecting the Imperial Altar** in **four boundaries and eight extremes**, **modeling Heaven and mirroring Earth**. We **unfold the Nine-Light Treasure** and **display the True Scriptures**, **summoning the True Spirits** and **invoking the Divine**, to **fulfill our prayers**.\n\nWe **respectfully present** the **Golden Dragon and Jade Tablet**, the **embroidered talismans of mandate**, the **oil lamps and incense flowers**, all **as per the ritual**. We **burn incense** and **recite the Dao/Way**, **baring our hearts** and **revealing our forms**, **lighting lamps** to **sustain the light** and **illuminate the dark night**. The **subordinates** follow the **fast ritual**, **presenting our words** to the **Supreme Dao/Way**.\n\nWe **pray** to the **Supreme Three Sovereigns**, the **Ten-Directional Saints**, the **Limitless Scriptures**, the **Great Lawmaster of the Mystic Middle**, the **Lingbao’s Supreme Truth**, and the **Three Realms’ officials**, that they **descend their divine gaze** and **review our humble offerings**.\n\nWe **humbly beseech** the **Imperial Edict** to command the **Supervisory Officials of the Bureau of Punishments** (乞敕勒监察曹属), the **Guardian Spirits of the Scriptures** (侍经威神), and the **Earthly and Local Officials of the True Dao** (土地真官), that they **united in purpose** (一合同心) and **concerted in strength** (并力营卫), **purge and clear** (扫荡) both **inner and outer realms**, **sanctify and purify the ritual platform** (清净坛场), **subdue and conquer demons and malevolent spirits** (降伏妖魔), and **behead and annihilate rebellious entities** (馘灭精祟).\n\nThus, our **subordinates** may **find peace in mind and steadiness in spirit** (心安神定), **reflect with sincerity and be moved by devotion** (思念立感), **present our petitions to the heights** (启奏上达), **fulfill our fasted rites** (斋功成就), and **encounter no obstruction** (无有窒碍).\n\nThough our **subordinates** bear the **Lingbao’s Supreme Truth** (至真) and **engage in the Great Law** (参修大法), we dwell within the **Five Turbidities** (五浊), stained by the **Six Dusts** (六尘), our **Three Passes** (三关) unregulated, and our **Six Passions** (六情) unrestrained. **We rely upon the prohibitions and precepts** (仰赖禁戒) to **restrain our bodies and minds** (以检身心), thus **observing the fasted rites and reciting the Dao/Way’s prohibitions and威仪** (辄依斋科，说戒威仪).\n\nMay all who **share in this fast** (同斋之人) **uniformly adhere to the Law’s teachings** (咸遵法训).\n\nAt the **dawn of the clear morning** (明旦晨晓), we **proceed in accordance with the Dao/Way** (依法行道), **renew and present our petitions** (续更启闻), and **respectfully submit** (谨启).\n\nNext, we **recite the Sutra of Wisdom** (智慧颂) three times in rotation, proceeding to the **Eastern Quarter** (至东方), each time **offering a bow** (各一拜).\n\nThen, we **chant the Sutra of the Bodhisattva’s Vows** (人各首体投地), **prostrate our bodies to the Earth** (体投地), and **bow in spirit to the Ten-Directional Saints** (心礼十方), each direction **once in turn** (方各一拜), beginning with the **North** (从北为始).\n\nFollowing this, we **perform the Cloud Ritual** (云礼足), the **officers kneeling level** (众官平跪), and **recite the Dao/Way’s prohibitions and威仪** (说戒威仪).\n\nNext, we **recite the precepts** (说戒).\n\nFinally, we **pledge the Twelve Vows** (十二愿).\n\nNext, we **conclude the Ritual of the Golden Sutra Assembly** (复炉) and **complete the Opening Ceremony of the Dao/Way’s Precepts** (金箓斋启坛仪竟).",

He **examines the celestial records**, **summons the transcendent**.\n\n**Northern Direction True Scripture**:\n   The **Northern Direction**, the **Dark Heaven**, the **Five Qi** **wandering**. Within it sits the **Black Emperor**, the **Double Sovereign of the Azure Micro**. He **oversees the talismans and mandates**, the **transcendents refining the Eight Auras**. In **green robes and feathered attire**, with **dragon script and phoenix garments**, the **Supreme Sovereign** **summons them** to the **Jade Stairs**.\n\n**Central Direction True Scripture**:\n   The **Central Direction**, the **Supreme Spirit**, the **Heavenly Sovereign**. The **Firstborn Five Old Ones**, the **Central Yellow High Sovereign**. He **controls the qi** and **supervises the truth**, **leads all beings**. He **records the mystic diagrams**, **hosts the jade scriptures**. He **guides the cosmic course** and **assists the divine breath**, **universally proclaiming to all spirits**.\n\nThe **High Functionary** with the **Dharma stations** complete, solemnly performs the **Golden Talisman Great Fast Ritual**. The **certain Mr. Certain** of the **Sacred Imperial Dao/Way**, the **subordinate officials**, humbly present this **petition** to the **Supreme Limitless Dao/Way**, the **Supreme Dao/Way Sovereign**, the **Supreme Old Sovereign**, the **Limitless Great Lingbao Heavenly Sovereign**, the **Great Saints of the Dao/Way** who have attained **Supreme Truth**, the **Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures**, the **Great Lawmaster of the Mystic Middle**, the **Heavenly Sovereign**, the **Supreme Minister and Supreme Overseer**, the **Four Officials and Five Emperors**, the **Three Realms’ officials**, and **all True Spirits**.\n\nThe **subordinates** hear that the **Supreme Dao/Way** **shines forth**, the **Three Vehicles** **govern the cosmic course**, and the **Sage** **manifests his teachings**. The **Three Talismans** **hang as decrees**, **assisting the world** and **securing the people**, **saving the age** and **propagating the doctrine**. They **protect the realm** and **uphold the Emperor**. For any **petition of sincerity**, it is **proper to submit** to the **Supreme Dao/Way**. We dare not **fail to present** our **words**.\n\nNext: **Reciting the Petition**\n   The **Emperor** has **inherited the divine blessings** and **received the auspicious mandate**, **continuing the heavenly rule** and **establishing the supreme pole**, **following the august lineage** and **governing the sacred times**, **seeking to spread the Dao/Way’s winds** and **bring peace to the people**. Yet he **fears** that the **people’s prosperity is not yet complete**, that **virtue and teaching are not yet trusted**. Sometimes **rewards and punishments** are **inappropriate**, and **laws and penalties** **fail in measure**. Sometimes the **yin and yang** are **disordered**, and the **sequence of qi** **falls out of harmony**. Only with **utter sincerity** do we **pray to the Supreme Dao/Way**.\n\nWe **contemplate** the **Heaven and Earth’s rulers**, who **oversee creation and transformation**, **governing the Three Realms’ True Spirits**. The **celestial officials** **reward the good** and **punish the evil**, **determine crimes** and **record merits**, **reaching the hidden and the manifest**, **striking great and small alike**. All **records and petitions** are **presented to the Supreme Dao/Way**. The **Heavenly Sovereign** **descends his compassionate gaze**, and the **Saints** **bestow their luminous blessings**. **Shadows follow voices**, and **all prayers are answered**.\n\nThus we **reverently establish the altar**, **devoutly observe the fast**, **concentrate our spirits** and **purify our thoughts**, **reform our conduct** and **calm our passions**. According to the **Golden Talisman’s clear scriptures** and the **True Science of the Upper Element**, at **certain location’s certain temple**, we **offer on behalf of the Emperor**, following the **ancient ritual norms**, **erecting the Imperial Altar** in **four boundaries and eight extremes**, **modeling Heaven and mirroring Earth**. We **unfold the Nine-Light Treasure** and **display the True Scriptures**, **summoning the True Spirits** and **invoking the Divine**, to **fulfill our prayers**.\n\nWe **respectfully present** the **Golden Dragon and Jade Tablet**, the **embroidered talismans of mandate**, the **oil lamps and incense flowers**, all **as per the ritual**. We **burn incense** and **recite the Dao/Way**, **baring our hearts** and **revealing our forms**, **lighting lamps** to **sustain the light** and **illuminate the dark night**. The **subordinates** follow the **fast ritual**, **presenting our words** to the **Supreme Dao/Way**.\n\nWe **pray** to the **Supreme Three Sovereigns**, the **Ten-Directional Saints**, the **Limitless Scriptures**, the **Great Lawmaster of the Mystic Middle**, the **Lingbao’s Supreme Truth**, and the **Three Realms’ officials**, that they **descend their divine gaze** and **review our humble offerings**.",
