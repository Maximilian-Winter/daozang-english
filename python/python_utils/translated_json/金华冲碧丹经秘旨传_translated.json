Dwelling at the western peak of **Éméi (Emei)**, I devoted myself throughout my life to **xíngchí (practice and cultivation)**, wandering among the clouds and waters, traversing rivers and lakes, and leaving footprints across half the land.\n\nDuring the **Jiādìng era (嘉定, 1208–1224)**, in the year **Wùyín (戊寅)**, while visiting **Sānshān (Three Mountains in Fujian)**, I paid homage to **Péng Zhēnlín (鹤林彭真士)**. Our discussions on **xíngchí and cultivation** deeply resonated with me. One day, **Péng Jūn** presented a scroll—*\"Shùjiē\" (数阶, \"Nine Grades\")*—transmitted by **Yùchán Bái Zhēnrén (玉蟾白真人)**, and all within were sacred, divine texts.\n\nWithin it, he secretly withdrew another book and hurriedly concealed it. I knelt and begged to see it. He said, *\"You have the fate of the Dao; I bring it forth for you.\"* Upon unfolding it, it was titled *The Jīnhuá Chōngbì Dānjīng*. Both its outer and inner teachings transcended mundane affairs, yet both aligned in essence.\n\nI bowed again, seeking its profound meaning. **Péng Jūn** agreed, instructing me to burn incense, swear an oath to the **Celestial Sovereign and Venerable Master**, and thus received its transmission.\n\nLater, in the month of **Jǐmǎo (己卯)**, I returned to **Chuān (Sichuan)**. Reviewing the *Dānjīng* I had obtained, though I possessed its transmission, I dared not personally apply it—now believing, now doubting. I had never before considered such matters, so I hesitated, fearing wasted effort.\n\nIn the year **Jiādìng Gēngchén (嘉定庚辰, 1210)**, I again traveled to **Báiè Dòngtiān (White Crane Cavernous Heaven)**, ascending the mountain until dusk. The forest ridges were ancient and secluded, vines entwined, cranes cried, and monkeys howled. Deep in the mountains, several thatched huts stood, their doors unguarded.\n\nI knocked, and a small mountain boy emerged, asking, *\"Who comes here?\"*\nI replied, *\"I am **Mèng Xuàn (孟煦)**, a traveler from **Xīshǔ**, seeking the Dao in leisure. May I rest briefly?\"*\nThe boy entered and returned, saying, *\"The Master invites you inside.\"*\n\nI entered and bowed before his **xianyan (仙颜, immortal visage)**. The Master’s appearance was ancient and strange, his voice like that of a child. I straightened my posture, lit the stove incense, and knelt, inquiring about his **xianhào (仙号, immortal name)**.\n\nHe said, *\"My surname is **Lán (兰)**, and my name is **Yuánbái Lǎorén (元白老人)**.\"*\n\nI stayed one night. That evening, he offered a simple meal—**mountain rice wine, roots, white yams, and huángjīng (黄精, Chinese Solomon’s seal)**. After one bite, my five **zàng (内脏, viscera)** felt refreshed, my limbs harmonious—unlike ordinary food. I knew then that my **qūn (缘, fate)** lay here, that I had encountered a true immortal.\n\nAs we sat, he asked what I considered the **Dao**. I answered, *\"My practice is **xíngchí (行持)**, and my cultivation is **nèiliàn (内炼)**.\"*\nThe Master smiled: *\"Both **xíngchí** and **nèiliàn** are not the **Zhìdào (至道, Ultimate Way)**.\"*\n\nI bowed again, asking, *\"How may I receive your transmission of **fùdù (付度, bestowal of the Dao)** and **xiūchí (修持, cultivation methods)**?\"*\nHe said, *\"If you remain sincere and diligent, and your resolve is steadfast, I will instruct you.\"*\n\nThe Master continued: *\"Within, use **yùqiān yùgǒng (玉铅玉汞, jade lead and jade mercury)**; without, employ **jīnyè jīngāo (金液金膏, golden elixir and golden salve)**. The refining follows two paths—one for **yīng (阴, yin)** and one for **yáng (阳, yang)**.\"*\n\nI was astonished and exclaimed, *\"Earlier, while visiting **Sānshān**, I received from **Péng Hèlín Zhēnguān (鹤林彭真官)** the **Dānfǎ (丹法, elixir method)** of **Bái Yùchán Xiānshī (白玉蟾仙师)**, which aligns with this principle!\"*\n\nThe Master asked, *\"Have you truly obtained its transmission?\"*\nI replied, *\"I possess this text—here, let me show it to you.\"* After examining it, he said:\n\n*\"This book was given by **Yùchán Zǐ (玉蟾子)** to **Péng Jūn**, whose inner studies were incomplete. He stamped it with **Píngshū’s (平叔) external elixir principles**, loosely mentioning **zhēnqiān (真铅, true lead)**. Though it clarifies **tànqiān jiétāi (探铅结胎, lead extraction and embryo formation)** and **fǎxiàng (法象, symbolic methods)**, the **huǒfú (火符, fire correspondences)** are incomplete. This proves **Péng Jūn’s** fate was shallow, leaving it unfinished.\"*\n\nThe Master asked, *\"Is it true that the **Saints transmit the medicine but not the fire**?\"*\n\nHe continued: *\"This book is an ancient *Dānjīng*, passed from **Xuānyuán Shì (轩辕氏, the Yellow Emperor)** to **Guǎngchéng Zǐ (广成子)** on **Kōngtóng Shān (崆峒山)**, teaching the **Jiǔliàn Jīnbì Dà Huándān Fǎ (九炼金碧大还丹法, Nine Refining Golden Jade Great Return Elixir Method)**—a scripture to **fútian jìshì (扶天济世, support Heaven and benefit the world)**, transcending the dusty realm. It is the **original text of the *Jīnbì Gǔwén Lónghǔ Shàngjīng (金碧古文龙虎上经)**.*\n\nIts outer layers contain the **Jiǔ Huán Qī Fǎn (九还七返, Nine Returns and Seven Reversions)** and the **hidden essence of *Jīnyè Shéndān (金液神丹)***, all transmitted by **Guǎngchéng Jūn (广成君)**. Since then, **xianren yǐnshì (仙人隐士, immortals and recluses)** refining the elixir have followed this path. Those who achieved **báirì chōngjǔ (白日冲举, daytime ascension)** are countless; those who practiced in secret but remained obscure are many as well.\n\nThe renowned among them include:\n- **Hàn Tiānshī (汉天师, the Han Celestial Masters)**\n- **Wèi Bóyáng (魏伯阳, Wei Boyang)**\n- **Táng Yè Jìngnéng (唐叶靖能), Yì Chángshēng (继长生), Mǎ Míngshēng (马明生), Dù Guāngmíng (杜光明)**.\n\nThose who obtained this book achieved **xíngshén jiūmiào (形神俱妙, perfection of both form and spirit)**.\n\nIn the **Jìn (Jin) dynasty**, **Wú Xǔ Èr Jūn (吴许二君)** and **Gě Jīnguǒ (葛金果)** also received this essence, and their entire families—young and old—all attained **chángshēng (长生, longevity)** and **gǎi xíngdùshì (改形度世, transformed their forms and transcended the world)**.\n\nOnly **Huáinán Liú Ān Wáng (淮南刘安王)** was divinely instructed, refining **báixuě língdān (白雪灵丹, Snowy Elixir of the Immortals)** from **Tàijí (太极, the Supreme Ultimate)**—**qiān hóng (铅汞, lead and mercury)**.\n\nYet **Wèi Bóyáng**, the **Tàishǒu of Hào (昊之太守)**, abandoned his post to enter the mountains, studying with **Zhāng Lǐ Èrzǐ (张李二子)**. They united in refining the **Great Elixir**, completing it but refusing to reveal the **Tiānjī (天机, Heaven’s secrets)**. Thus, they concealed the **hidden essence of the *Dānjīng*** and instead composed *The Cāntóng Qì (参同契)*, supplementing the **Lónghǔ Dānjīng Zhèngwén (龙虎丹经正文)** with **Dà Yì (大易, the Great Changes)** to speak of **huǒhòu (火候, fire and timing)**, yet leaving **fǎxiàng (法象, methods and symbols)** and **yàowù (药物, pharmaceuticals)** veiled in obscure language—deep and ancient, difficult to comprehend. To this day, its transmission is lost.\n\nThe Master said: *\"I obtained this Dao from an ancient immortal, knowing its true source. My own cultivation is now complete.\"*\n\nNow you have the fate to reach this place, sworn by blood oath to Heaven, to transmit the secret essentials, the hidden scriptures of methods and symbols, and the nine-cycle elixir of the divine.\n\nI, following my master’s teachings, knelt a hundred times in solemn vow, and thus received his transmission. Upon reading and reciting, the great methods all resemble those of Peng Jun, yet the techniques of water and fire, the methods and symbols, differ entirely.\n\nThat evening was already late, so I returned to pay respects to the Master and descended the mountain. Yet my heart still hung suspended, and I longed to return to the hidden retreat, seeking again the profound mysteries. But only white clouds veiled the peaks, the woods faint and indistinct—like a dream, with no trace of people or huts, only vanished grass shelters. Astonished and bewildered, I wandered as if drunk or mad.\n\nA short while later, the sun rose high, and a Daoist passed over the ridge below, asking the reason for my distress. The Daoist said: *\"In times past, this mountain held a lofty recluse, a master of elixir cultivation here. I have heard of him—known as the Old Man Yuanbai, who was the transformation of Yùchán.\"*\n\nAgain, white clouds enveloped the peaks, revealing the Master’s ascension. The ancient immortal, surnamed Lan, encountered the Patriarch, blessed with early virtue and fortune, and was granted the transmission of profound mysteries once more. I am now the appointed successor to Yùchán the Immortal Master, not daring to slacken. From beginning to end, I continue in the footsteps of the sages, and thus I honor the two masters—Lan Yuan and Bai—as well as the eleventh in their lineage.\n\nReturning to Shu, I secluded myself at the western peak of Éméi, pledged to Heaven, built an altar, and constructed a hall, naming it the *Jīnhuá Chōngbì Dānshì* (Golden Flower Piercing Azure Elixir Hall), also following Peng Jun’s name of *Jìng*.\n\nHaving received this text, I observed strict fasting and purification, inviting three virtuous scholars to join in cultivation. In one year, we attained completion—this was in the year *Jiaxi* of Jiading.\n\nI and my kin, twenty-five in number—old and young, male and female—all benefited from Heaven’s grace, each taking the elixir of transformed essence. In a year, our forms and destinies were renewed. Even the rebellious Shu governor Wu Xi could not harm us.\n\nReflecting on this wondrous text and its hidden meaning, Master Yuanbai said: *\"When you meet a true adept, do not conceal it; if it is not one, do not reveal it.\"* Now I compile this on silk and parchment, recording its origins in a treasure chest, hidden within the caves of a named mountain. If one later finds it, it is Heaven’s transmission.\n\nThose who know of it afterward are surely children of the Daoist lineage. Perhaps they will refine it again, conceal it in a named mountain, fulfilling my wish.\n\nThis was in the year *Yǒuxù* of Bǎoqìng, on the *Yǐsì* day of the full moon in Chunyang, in the western Shu of Meng Xué.",

The ancient immortal, surnamed Lan, encountered the Patriarch, blessed with early virtue and fortune, and was granted the transmission of profound mysteries once more. I am now the appointed successor to Yùchán the Immortal Master, not daring to slacken. From beginning to end, I continue in the footsteps of the sages, and thus I honor the two masters—Lan Yuan and Bai—as well as the eleventh in their lineage.\n\nReturning to Shu, I secluded myself at the western peak of Éméi, pledged to Heaven, built an altar, and constructed a hall, naming it the *Jīnhuá Chōngbì Dānshì* (Golden Flower Piercing Azure Elixir Hall), also following Peng Jun’s name of *Jìng*.\n\nHaving received this text, I observed strict fasting and purification, inviting three virtuous scholars to join in cultivation. In one year, we attained completion—this was in the year *Jiaxi* of Jiading.\n\nI and my kin, twenty-five in number—old and young, male and female—all benefited from Heaven’s grace, each taking the elixir of transformed essence. In a year, our forms and destinies were renewed. Even the rebellious Shu governor Wu Xi could not harm us.\n\nReflecting on this wondrous text and its hidden meaning, Master Yuanbai said: *\"When you meet a true adept, do not conceal it; if it is not one, do not reveal it.\"* Now I compile this on silk and parchment, recording its origins in a treasure chest, hidden within the caves of a named mountain. If one later finds it, it is Heaven’s transmission.\n\nThose who know of it afterward are surely children of the Daoist lineage. Perhaps they will refine it again, conceal it in a named mountain, fulfilling my wish.\n\nThis was in the year *Yǒuxù* of Bǎoqìng, on the *Yǐsì* day of the full moon in Chunyang, in the western Shu of Meng Xué.",

To this day, its transmission is lost.\n\nThe Master said: *\"I obtained this Dao from an ancient immortal, knowing its true source. My own cultivation is now complete.\"*",
