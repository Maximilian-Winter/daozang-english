Ten volumes.\n*Source Edition:* **The *Wànlì Continuation of the Daoist Canon*** (萬曆續道藏).\n\n---\n\n**Volume 1: Annotated Commentaries on the *Huáng Jīng***\n**Preface to the *Huáng Jīng* Annotated Commentaries**\n\nThe Dao is beyond words—all scriptures are the traces of the True Saints’ breath.\nYet since words reveal the Dao, even the sages and worthies do not discard them.\nSince the Three Realms were divided, the teachings of names were established,\nand though their essence is fundamentally unified, those who err may distort them.\nDistortion is not the truth.\n\nBefore the myriad kalpas, the Original Beginning sat in radiant illumination.\nAt that time, the supreme cosmic order gathered,\nand the myriad True Ones questioned the Jade Emperor about the causes of his deeds,\nwhereupon he expounded this scripture.\nThus, it is the most honored of all doctrinal texts,\nthe first of all sacred writings—no other scripture surpasses it.\n\nIts profound words are hidden and subtle,\nnot indulging in extravagant ornamentation.\nThough paired with the *Dàfàn* (大梵), its meaning is boundless,\nand even the saints cannot fully articulate it,\nnor can speculation reach its depths.\nThis scripture encompasses all mysteries as if they were held in the palm.\n\nI, **Zhang Zhòng** (張仲), was devoted to ancient texts during my lifetime,\nserving in the Zhou Dynasty.\nMy lineage revered the Celestial Emperor,\nand upon hearing this scripture,\nI vowed to preserve it as a lifelong treasure.\n\nThe Emperor, comparing my merits and demerits in the mortal world,\nrecorded me as one who walked the path of loyalty and filial piety,\nand thus entrusted me to oversee the transformation of the Nine Heavens,\ncommanding me to compile this scripture.\nWithin its depths, I tasted its ineffable mysteries.\n\nAlas, those in the world who study this scripture\nfail to grasp the saints’ intent or harmonize with its Daoist essence,\nerroneously publishing and transmitting it—sometimes misquoting its words and rhythms—\nleading to its division into two titles: *Dòngxuán* (洞玄) and *Gāoshàng* (高上),\neach clinging to private interpretations in their transmission.\nThis greatly contradicts the original intent of the scripture,\neven to the point of rigidly adhering to falsehoods.\n\nThe reckless and deluded may either disbelieve this scripture,\nor claim it borrows from other canonical works,\nor ignorantly force interpretations upon it.\nAll such errors fail to recognize its supreme authority,\nyet the consequences of karma—blessing, guilt, and retribution—\ncannot be evaded.\n\nI, Zhang Zhòng, could not bear to see this sacred text lost,\nnor the vulgar ignorance of the age misapplying its teachings.\nThus, I petitioned the Emperor\nto have the Daoist immortals elucidate its meaning and spread it among mortals,\nmaking it the key to exhausting the scriptures’ depths,\nand the ladder to humanity’s path.\n\nMay those who follow its sacred laws\ncross the endless sea of delusion;\nmay its Daoist elixirs\nease the deepest of afflictions.\nHearing this scripture and awakening to the Dao,\none shall forever abandon false speculation;\nencountering its teachings and recognizing the True,\none shall finally escape the cycle of rebirth.\n\nFrom the Three Thousand Great Thousands,\nevery realm is the domain of the Great Unity;\nfrom kalpa to kalpa,\nevery generation becomes a field of joy and benefit.\n\nSeeking the Dao, one must attain it;\nno wish shall remain unfulfilled.\nThe virtues of this scripture\nare thus without reproach.\n\nRespectfully composed.\nWith utmost reverence, **Zhang Zhòng**, the Imperial臣 of the **Nine-Heaven Transformative Texts** (九天開化文昌梓橦帝君), prostrates himself a hundred times.\n\n---\n**On the Dao**\nComposed by **Lǎorén Yānxiān** (老人臞仙), the aged sage of the Southern Pole.\n\n**On the Dao**\nComposed by **Lǎorén Yānxiān** (老人臞仙), the aged sage of the Southern Pole.\n\n---\n\nYānxiān says: When examining the origins of the Daoist teaching, in the primal chaos when distinctions first emerged, human affairs were yet incomplete. The Celestial Mandate (天命) bestowed upon our Daoist Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor (轩辕黄帝), to inherit the **Nine Sovereigns’** (九皇) dispensation, wield the **Six Dragons** (六龙) to govern Heaven, and establish the Celestial Pole (极) in place of Heaven, thus ordering the **Three Talents** (三才). At that time, the heavens and earth were still indistinct, lacking script, so he used knotted cords (结绳) to administer affairs; lacking dwellings, he lived in nests and caves (巢居以穴处); lacking garments, he bound grass to cover his body (结草以蔽体); lacking vessels, he drank from his cupped hands (汗尊而杯饮). Our Daoist Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor, first devised script, garments, palaces, and vessels, thereby completing human affairs. Today, among the **Nine Schools** (九流) and within the **Three Teachings** (三教), the script used, the garments worn, the dwellings inhabited, and the vessels employed are all originally instituted by the Yellow Emperor. Thus, these all stem from the Daoist teaching of the Yellow Emperor.\n\nMoreover, the **Laozi** (老子) proclaimed: *\"To give birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things, there must be that which gives birth. I do not know its name; I forcefully name it the Dao, and forcefully call it Great, hence the Great Dao, and its teaching is Daoism.\"* Only then did the term *Dao* (道) appear in the world. Therefore, those who speak of *practicing the Dao* or *studying the Dao* are all appropriating the words of the **Laozi**, using *Dao* as their name. Are they not the disciples of the **Laozi**?\n\nAgain, when the **Laozi** spoke of *\"the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious, the Gate of All Marvels\"* (玄之又玄，为众妙门), the two characters *Mysterious* (玄) were also taken as names and applied to scriptures. Thus, these are all uses of the **Laozi’s** words.\n\nFurther, the *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》) text states: *\"There is the Great Awakening (大觉), and only then does one know the Sage.\"* The term *Great Awakening* (大觉) was a name established by **Zhuangzi**; the **Emperor Huizong** (徽宗) adopted it and conferred the title *Golden Sage* (金仙) upon it. The scriptures all employ this term—these are all derived from the Daoist texts and the teachings of the Yellow Emperor, **Laozi**, and **Zhuangzi**.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Imperial Scripture’s Continuation and Annotation**\nThe character *Dao* (道) is revered equally by the **Three Teachings** (三教). Yet, reckless and deluded sects falsely label the Dao as the **Two Vehicles** (二乘), which is a profound misunderstanding. The **Jade Emperor** (玉帝) is likewise venerated by the **Three Teachings** (三教). Blind followers sometimes call him the *Lord of Heaven* (天主), claiming he is not sufficiently honored—this fails to grasp the **Jade Emperor’s** true essence and origins.\n\nThe Emperor’s virtue is boundless; his merit, unspoiled. His station is most exalted, his name most triumphant, governing all ten thousand worlds, encompassing the **Three Teachings**. He rules over the **Three Thousand Great Thousands** (三千大千), transcending kalpas with ease. The Confucianists call him the *Supreme Lord* (上帝), the Buddhists name him *Flame-Light* (燃灯), and the Daoists honor him as the *Mysterious Master* (玄主). His grandeur surpasses all others.\n\nBeholding this scripture, one recognizes the Emperor’s wondrous deeds, dispelling doubts and perplexities of ages past and present. Alas, those who fail to understand it, who have not yet grasped its meaning, still indulge in false speculation, unable to awaken, and their sins deepen evermore. Do they not realize that human life originates from the Dao, is governed by the Emperor, and finds clarity in the Sage’s instructions?\n\nIf one scorns the Emperor, belittles Heaven, defames the scriptures, or fails to comprehend the Great Dao, it is as though one turns away from one’s roots and forgets one’s kin—unaware of the fundamental source of life and creation. Your servant, **Lǚ Wēi** (吕嵓), has long lamented this, and thus composes this preface at the head of the scripture’s annotations as a warning.\n\n---\n\n**Second Preface to the Imperial Scripture’s Continuation and Annotation**\nThe existence of Daoist scriptures is like the presence of the sun and moon in Heaven, or the statutes of a state. To behold the sun and moon yet turn one’s face to the wall is to avoid folly; to follow the laws of the ancient kings is to commit no errors. Then, to revere the true scriptures is surely the standard for entering the Dao.\n\nMoreover, this scripture was transmitted by **Yuánshǐ** (元始), and the **Jade Emperor** and all the gods proclaimed it. It is the highest grade among the **Three Teachings**, the secret speech of the **Great Sage** (大圣), worthy of reverence in every place and kalpa.\n\nYet, the Dao that transcends speech is already embodied in this scripture—why need further annotations? Still, the scriptures are written in words, and only those who have already attained the Dao can truly perceive them. For those who have not yet entered the gate, these annotations are indeed a profound aid. Without a raft, how does one cross the river? Alas, to seek the Dao apart from the scriptures is wrong; to cling to the scriptures as the Dao itself is also wrong.\n\nWith the heart observing the scripture, and the scripture illuminating the heart,\nwhen heart and spirit merge in harmony—\nthis celestial treasure of sacred verses\nis inherently within my very nature.\n\n**True enlightenment** thus transcends mere textual fixation—\nhow could there be any duality of affliction?\n\nWith reverence, **Chángchūn Fǔhuà Míngyīng Zhēn Jūn** and his disciple **Qióu Chǔjī** prostrate and pay homage.\n\n**Preface to the *Royal Scripture*’s Collected Commentaries (First Four Sequences)**\n\nThe Dao is vast, the Jade Emperor’s majesty supreme—\nthe *Royal Scripture*’s sacred profundity\nhas long been known to me with awe.\n\nYet the world is often blind, giving rise to false speculation,\nclaiming the Dao can be abandoned,\nthe Celestial can be profaned,\nthe sacred scriptures can be slighted?\nHow could this be?\n\nFor the Dao exists in the scripture,\nand the scripture is the very nature of this body;\nthe Celestial Emperor exists in Heaven,\nand the Heavenly Sovereign resides within this form.\n\nWithout this embodied form, nature has no foundation,\nand its marvels remain obscured;\nwithout the Heavenly Sovereign, the body lacks a master,\nand the form becomes mere emptiness.\n\nSince body and heart cannot be abandoned,\nhow could the Emperor’s grace go unrepaid,\nthe scripture’s merit go unacknowledged?\n\nYet faith in the scripture is not mere textual adherence—\nit is the divine realization of the heart.\nIf truly attained and never forgotten,\nthen the wondrous fruit will surely manifest.\n\nWith reverence, **Léitíng Dàyuán Shuài** and his disciple **Dèng Tiān Jūn** prostrate and pay homage in solemn devotion.\n\n**Three Praises**\n**Dèng Tiān Jūn** kneels and declares:\n\n**Praise**\nGreat is the Supreme Dao, without sectarian bounds—\nthe True One above all.\nThe Dao\nSoars beyond the Three Teachings,\nand this alone is most honored.\n\n**Praise**\nMajestic is the Jade Emperor,\nunmatched among the Three Teachings.\nThe Emperor\nOver vast sands and calamitous ages,\neternally returns to the Supreme Sovereign.\n\n**Praise**\nThe Imperial Scripture, a grand canon,\nsubtle and profound.\nThe Scripture\nEmbraces all Three Teachings,\nits dharma-rules most exalted.\n\n**Preface to the *Royal Scripture with Annotations: Initial Compilation***\n\nThe Sage-King did not speak of gods,\nyet revered the Supreme Sovereign;\nThe Confucian scholar avoided esoteric talk,\nyet upheld the study of the heart.\n\nThe Supreme Sovereign was indeed what the Confucian\ndared not slight—\nyet none observed the Dao-scriptures,\ngrasped the profound intent,\nor fused the Three into One.\n\nWas it because they established separate schools?\nOr because they lacked time to practice the Way?\nAlas, how narrow-minded!\n\nThe matter lies not in conforming to names,\nbut in the true benefit of the Dao.\nIf the Mystic Scripture is wrong,\nhow can it speak of the Way?\nIf it is correct,\nwhy then does it differ from Confucianism,\nand why cling so rigidly?\n\nYour servant, Hong Xian, in youth studied Confucian texts,\nand once encountered the Mystic Canon—\nas if gaining some insight, yet dared not claim it.\nLater, ascending to the Dragon’s Peak,\ndwelling on the Golden Phoenix Slope,\nI had the chance to peruse the Three Teachings’ writings,\nand came to know that none surpasses the Dao,\nnone is deeper than the Mystic.\n\nAmong the Three Teachings, none surpasses the *Royal Scripture*,\nlike beans, grains, cloth, and silk—indispensable.\nIts profound meanings are hard to fathom;\nthe annotations of the immortals must be transmitted.\nThus, I withdrew to the secular world,\ndevoutly compiling this volume.\nAlas, my frail body weakens daily,\nand I have not yet seen it published.\n\nLater, I met a recluse from Shandong’s Jinan,\nMaster Zhou Yunqing,\nwho lectured on the Mystic Scripture\nand compiled the *Dao Canon*,\nso I entrusted my words to my friend Tian Zhuozi\nto record and pass them on.\n\nWinter of the Ming Dynasty’s Wanli thirteenth year,\nformer Chief Examiner Fang Yiji of Jiangxi\nknocked at my door to request this preface.\n\n**Preface to the *Royal Scripture with Annotations***\n\nThe difficulty of speaking of the Dao has long endured.\n\n---\n\nI, **Xuan Zheng**, am but a coarse and lowly scholar of the secular world—how dare I speak of the Dao, or compile the *Mystic Canon* and annotate the *Royal Scripture*?\n\nTo carry a mountain on a mosquito’s back is folly; it only reveals my inadequacy.\n\nYet the Great Dao does not abandon the humble and unrefined, and even the lowly can grasp its teachings.\n\nThough the *Jewel Scripture* is profound, the annotations of the immortals are clear and evident.\nWhen **Master Luo Taishi** entrusted me with this work, not including it in the *Dao Canon* would be to conceal Heaven’s treasure;\nincluding it without proper understanding would be equally perilous.\n\nI fear that my limited insights may misrepresent the Dao’s essence,\nfail to harmonize the immortal’s intent with my own,\nand force-feed interpretations that leave readers unsettled—\nspoiling the Dao’s pure flavor, and thus my own guilt would be all the greater.\n\nAlas, those who expound the Dao are few in this age,\nand I, a humble and unlearned man, presume to record my thoughts.\nIt is fitting that I incur blame without merit.\n\nBut my resolve is to uphold the Dao,\nand if the esteemed **Dao-adept** **Yingliu** examines my words with compassion,\nthen continues to elucidate their meaning to propagate this Scripture’s truth,\nmy labor will not be in vain.\n\nRespectfully written,\n**Ming Wanli fifteenth year (1587),** the Dao-adept **Zhou Xuan Zheng of Shandong** pays homage in a hundred bows.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Royal Scripture with Annotations*—Copy for Circulation**\n\nTo uphold the Dao and illuminate one’s name,\nthus honoring one’s ancestors—\nthis is the age-old principle of **loyalty as the fulfillment of filial piety**.\n\nI, **Wang Jingcu**, was raised in Confucian scholarship,\nthough I knew of Heavenly Emperor’s grandeur,\nI truly understood that the Dao’s practice lies beyond worldly gain.\n\nAfter studying the *Dao Canon* under **Master Zhou Yunqing**,\nand diligently transcribing texts,\nI observed the *Royal Scripture’s Annotations* and realized:\nthe Three Teachings share a single principle,\nand **Nature** and **Dao** are inseparable.\n\nThis Scripture points directly to the Mystic Essence—\nunderstanding it reveals the Dao in its entirety.\n\nThus, I presumptuously wrote this preface to inspire myself,\n**Ming Wanli sixteenth year (1588), summer, in the capital**,\nthe Dao-adept **Wang Jingcu** pays homage.\n\n---\n**Examination of the Dao’s Origins**\n\n**Examination of the Dao’s Origins**\n\nThe Dao is originally formless and nameless—who could probe its source, whence could it be examined? From the Primordial Beginning, the Great Void bore the Mystic Existence, and the Dao’s hidden splendor emerged, its name thereby established. The One True Principle encompasses the Three, and the Three Teachings stand forth. Being and non-being, beginning and end, are not beyond the Five Phases. Eon follows eon in generation, sage follows sage in transmission—all are the Dao. Even if one transcends the Three Realms and lies beyond the Five Phases, one cannot escape being a practitioner of the Dao. Thus, the Dao’s manifestation and the name of the Daoist school originate here. Therefore, we first trace the source of the Scripture.\n\n**Source of the Scripture**\nScriptures bear the Dao, guiding the world with compassionate passage. All scriptures are the sacred utterances of enlightened sages, containing nothing but supreme truth. Yet this Scripture originates from the Primordial Beginning, its transformation rooted in the Jade Emperor. The Primordial Beginning is the first of the Three Teachings, the Jade Emperor the sovereign of all laws. This Scripture reaches the utmost profundity and subtlety, surpassing the Three Teachings; it is also the king of all scriptures, enduring through endless calamities. Its transmission begins from the beginningless, concealed in the Mystic Heaven, hidden within the Jade Peak. Its characters are not of ordinary kind—each spans a yard in breadth, their light piercing infinitely. The Celestial True Person, in response to the times, inscribed and passed it down to the world. Thus, the Scripture’s proclamation was made.\n\nTherefore, we continue tracing the Dao’s source.\n\n**The Jade Emperor: Supreme Sage, Original Master, and Lineage**\nThe Master, to guide the world, dispels delusion and extracts beings from suffering, transmitting the Dao and bestowing scriptures, opening the path for future generations. The Great Dao Master unifies the Three Teachings, encompasses all laws, dwelling in the Heaven of Heavens, as the Sage among sages—beginningless and endless, its origin unfathomable, prior to all phenomena. Yet the Dao’s subtlety divides into the True: it manifests in the radiant, pure, and blissful realm of the past eon.\n\nMortals observe the Yang Dao of Heaven’s brilliance—Yang governs bestowal, its mechanism ever active. The Emperor is thus revered as the **Zhang Emperor**. Misguided followers fail to grasp this truth, falsely claiming that the present **Zhang clan of Xingtai, Hebei (formerly True Definition Prefecture, Row Tang County)**, descends from the Jade Emperor. How could they confuse the **Zhang clan of Row Tang**, descendants of **Zhang Guo** and heirs of the **Zhang Immortal**, with such a claim?\n\nThis is merely an examination of lineage and clan.\n\nIf one speaks of lineage, the Jade Emperor is the primordial emanation of the Great Dao, the ancient ancestor of the cosmic cataclysm—how could he be bound by birth, death, or name? The Emperor’s sacred consort, sacred children, and attendants are all manifestations of the Light-Strong Prince’s celestial retinue in past eons. When the Emperor ascends, his retinue attains the Way entirely. In truth, the Emperor and his retinue are not of mortal female form—they are the purest essence of Heaven. To guide all beings, they manifest in female form, as the scriptures have already stated. Even the Buddha attained enlightenment with his wife and children achieving sainthood.\n\nTo call the Jade Emperor the **Dao Ancestor**, across countless eons, all beings and classes are the generative intent of Heaven and Earth, branches of the Dao’s vital pulse. Who among them is not part of the Jade Emperor’s retinue and lineage? When the retinue of the Great Luo Palace attains the Way, they become celestial and saintly bodies. As with Manjusri presiding over the Immaculate World, or the Dragon Princess attaining the Way and transforming into male form—this is the same principle.\n\nYet today’s monks, Daoists, and common folk fail to grasp this truth, falsely believing the Jade Emperor has a retinue, undergoes rebirth, and is bound to the Two Vehicle fruits. How could they know that the celestial realms are countless, while the Three Pure Ones’ realm and the Great Luo Heaven are boundless? The celestial emperors undergo rebirth, but the Jade Emperor does not. For the Jade Emperor is the Dao Body—Dao is endless, how could the Jade Emperor be finite?\n\nTruly, the Jade Emperor is the supreme teacher of all Buddhas of the One Vehicle, the sovereign of all heavens, and his retinue is the marvel of Dao transformation. Such is the essence of the mystical lineage.\n\nScholars must not speak recklessly—examine this carefully.\n\n**On the Merit of Engraving Scriptures:**\nIn ancient times, there were no paper or brushes; records were inscribed on bamboo and wood. When **Mong Tian** and **Cai Lun** invented paper and ink, the merit of preserving scriptures doubled. Later, high sages carved wooden blocks for printing, multiplying the merit yet again.\n\nYet ignorant followers of false sects do not know that Mong Tian and Cai Lun received blessings from the **Tusita Heaven**, and that these two were later punished in the underworld for their sins. Their journey through the netherworld was guided by the **Great Sage of the Great Elixir Heaven** and **Kshitigarbha Bodhisattva**, who entered the underworld with scriptures to transform and liberate those guilty of heresy. How could these two suffer in hell? Their merit was vast—they were of the highest rank in engraving and propagating the teachings.\n\n**On the Merit of Reciting, Chanting, and Teaching Scriptures:**\nRecitation and exposition must be done with utmost sincerity, free from attachment, greed, or delusion. The merit will then match the scriptures’ words. Printing and distributing scriptures bring even greater merit, as they spread the Dharma widely. To treat scriptures lightly, defame them, or damage them is a grave offense. Be warned—do not betray the teachings of the sages.\n\n**On the Similarities and Differences of the Jade Emperor’s Sacred Titles:**\nThe Jade Emperor’s sacred titles date from before the cosmic cataclysm, were further honored in the Middle Ages, and are now praised anew. Rulers who cherish the Dao, moved by the **Mysterious Grace**, honor them according to their own revelations and devotions. As circumstances align and deeds are accomplished, their fame spreads, and all revere the divine titles, establishing their names.\n\nThe Jade Emperor has four forms:\n1. The **Taiwei Jade Emperor**, named after the star **Taiwei** in the **Taiwei Enclosure** during the Han dynasty under Emperor Wu;\n2. The **Brahman Heaven Jade Emperor**, named after the **Celestial Market Enclosure** during Emperor Xuan’s reign;\n3. The **Flame Flower Shao Wei Jade Emperor**, named after the **Primordial Fixed Position** during Emperor Ai’s reign;\n4. The **Zixu Jade Emperor**, named after the **Post-Heaven Stem** during Emperor Guangwu’s reign.\n\nNone of these are the true Jade Emperor. The true Jade Emperor bears the title:\n**Emperor of the Golden Gate of the Highest Sovereign of the Natural and Mysterious Perfection, the Primal and Perfect, the Jade Sovereign Emperor, also called the Highest Supreme Jade Emperor of the Mysterious Vault.**\n\nThis Emperor governs all heavens, never decaying or perishing. The world does not fully understand, mistakenly equating him with **Shakra (Indra)**. Yet the Jade Emperor’s titles are distinct. The four Jade Emperors all fall under the governance of the **Highest Supreme Jade Emperor**. Those who speak of the Four Emperors and the Heavenly Sovereign as equals are also mistaken. Those who understand the heavens will clarify this.\n\n**On the Jade Emperor’s Sovereignty Over the Extremes:**\n**Ge Xianhui** said: The heavens of the world, as perceived, are the same. Confucianism speaks of **One Heaven and Earth, One Emperor**. Daoism speaks of **thirty billion worlds**, each with thirty-six heavens, each heaven ruled by an emperor, all under the governance of the **Highest Supreme Jade Emperor**. Buddhism speaks of **three thousand great thousand-world systems**, each with thirty-two heavens, each ruled by a Jade Emperor.\n\nThough the three teachings seem divergent, those who speak of **One Heaven** refer to the **Great Void** beyond, calling it unfathomable, and speak of **thirty billion worlds**—beyond which lies the **Inconceivable**. Those who speak of **three thousand great thousand-world systems** say that beyond them lies the **Limitless**. Thus, Confucianism follows the **Imperial Norm**, saying, *\"The sage approximates Heaven.\"* Heaven’s body is boundless, and this principle holds true at the **Great Convergence of the Cosmic Cycle**.\n\nDaoism speaks of the **Highest Supreme Void**, the True Emperor who never decays; Buddhism speaks of **Suchness**, self-liberated and never regressing. Both affirm that the Jade Emperor never perishes. Thus, speaking of **One Heaven** is not an omission—it is a general name encompassing all, harmonizing with Dao and Buddhism. Speaking of **thirty billion worlds** or **three thousand great thousand-world systems** is not false—it is a division by number, aligning with Confucianism.\n\nAs for Buddhism’s claim that each world has its own Jade Emperor, each realm has its own **Ultimate**, Daoism asserts that all worlds share **this Jade Emperor**, all realms share **the One Beyond Extremes**. The **Great Void**, the **Inconceivable**, the **Limitless**—all speak of the unchanging Dao, the Jade Emperor ever-present. If one divides worlds and claims the Jade Emperor differs, how could the **Beyond Extremes** have duality? If one says the Emperor changes with cosmic cycles, how could the **Beyond Extremes** decay?\n\nSince the Dao does not decay, the Jade Emperor is eternal. Truly, do not cling to demonic doctrines to defame the sages.\n\n**On the Jade Emperor’s Realm of Qingwei Heaven:**\n**Wang Chongyang** said: **Qingwei** is the highest and most mysterious realm of Heaven, the Daoist **Seed-Citizen Heaven**, the Confucian **Boundless Beyond**, the **Enduring Azure**—and in Buddhism, the **Non-Regressing Realm**.\n\n「Now within the chaotic scriptures of Chan Buddhism, there is a mistaken claim that the Jade Emperor resides atop **Mount Sumeru (Must Prāṇidhāna)**, which is actually the realm of the **Four Heavenly Kings of the Day and Moon (Sūryaprabhāraja, Candraprabhāraja, and the four Dikpāla)**—a place where destruction may occur, save for the **Inner Court of Maitreya (Maitreya’s Inner Sanctuary)** as the **Non-Regressing Realm**.\n\nThey also speak of **Mileo Enclosure (Mīlùo Yuán)**, **Mileo Garden (Mīlùo Yuán)**, or **Mileo’s Pure True Realm (Mīlùo Xuánzhēn Jìng)**—these three names refer to the **Supreme Primordial Lord (Wúshàng Yuánjūn)** of Daoist scriptures, who manifests as the Jade Emperor in the **Non-Regressing Realm of Mileo’s Pure True Realm (Mīlùo Xuánzhēn Jìng)**. The **Four Heavenly Kings of the Day and Moon**, however, are the abode of the **Lesser Heavenly Emperor (Tàiwēi Yùdì)**, not the **Great Heavenly Emperor (Dàtiānzūn)**, the exalted Jade Emperor. Hence, Daoist scriptures say:\n\n*\"At the peak of **Mount Xuangu (Xuángǔ Shān)**, there is an **Imperial Sovereign (Dìjūn)**. One must pay homage to the **Jade Sovereign, Great Heavenly Emperor (Yùhuáng Dàtiānzūn)**.\"*\n\n**Mount Xuangu (Xuángǔ Shān)** is the Chan Buddhist **Mount Sumeru (Must Prāṇidhāna)**, the master of the **Day and Moon Heavenly Realm (Rìyuè Tiān)**, and the deity governing this realm—akin to the **Prefect of the Imperial Capital (Jīngzào Yìn)** of ancient times. Thus, when the **Buddha (Rúshì)** preaches the **Dharma (Fǎ)**, and the Emperor of the **Heavenly Realm (Tiānshì)** spreads his canopy—this is the **state examination (Zhuàngyuán Jìdì)** where a scholar attains highest honors. The **Golden Hall (Jīndiàn)** transmits the successful candidates, the **Ministry of Rites (Lǐbù)** raises the cups, and the **Prefect of the Imperial Capital (Jīngzào Yìn)** spreads the canopy to honor the **court’s recognition of virtue (cháotiān zhēngxián zhī yì)**. The heretical sects thus falsely equate the **canopy-spreading Emperor of the Heavenly Realm (Zhānggài Jīngzào Yìn)** with the **Great Heavenly Emperor (Dàtiānzūn)**, declaring the **Prefect of the Imperial Capital (Zhānggài Jīngzào Yìn)** as the **Emperor (Huángdì)**. How erroneous this is! Such falsehoods are most perverse.\n\nAs for the claim that **Mount Kunlun (Kūnlún Shān)** has eight abodes: the **Eight Directions** may indeed encompass eight extremes, but all eight extremes converge in the **western-northern direction (xīběi)**, where **Mount Kunlun (Kūnlún Shān)** stands as the **Pillar of Heaven and Cornerstone of Earth (Tiānzhù Dìwéi)**—the Daoist **Mount Xuangu (Xuángǔ Shān)** and the Buddhist **Mount Sumeru (Must Prāṇidhāna)**. How could there be eight of them? The common folk have long been misled by such falsehoods, so now, in examining the **Non-Regressing Realm of Qingwei Heaven (Qīngwēi Tiān)**, I clarify and warn against mistaken theories.\n\n**On the Jade Emperor’s Rank and Status (Yùdì Zūncì Kǎo):**\n**Liu Haichan (Liú Hǎichán)** said: The Jade Emperor, in Daoism, is the **manifestation of the Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)**. Daoists first speak of the **Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)**, then the **Void (Xūwú)** and the **Mysterious Existence (Miàohǔ)**, which are the **Non-Extreme (Wújí)** and **Great Ultimate (Tàijí)**—not implying any hierarchy of superiority or inferiority. In Buddhism, he is the **Ancient Lamp Buddha (Rán Dēng Gǔfó)**, who reveals himself in the **body of Śākyamuni Buddha (Shìjiā Fóshēn)**. Chan Buddhists, however, place the Jade Emperor before the Buddha, following the foreign custom of honoring their **ruler (Zhǔ)** before the **Chinese Emperor (Huángdì)**.\n\nIf we examine the Daoist reverence, the *Golden Wheel Sutra (Jīn Lún Jīng)* states:\n*\"The Jade Emperor mounts the **Mysterious Command Chariot (Yùdòu Xuánmìng Jià)**, his spirit traverses the **Supreme Extremity (Shàngjí)**, with the **Five Stars (Wǔxīng)** as his messengers before him, and the **Buddhas and Devas (Shìfàn)** as his **威仪 (auspicious retinue)** behind him.\"*\n\nThe **Buddhas and Devas (Shìfàn)** are **immortals, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas (Xiānfó Púsà)**. The Jade Emperor’s trust in the **Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)** and the **Buddhas (Fó)** demonstrates his **body (shēn)** and **degree (dù)** to guide all sentient beings, leading them to **return to the Dao (guīdào)**. The common folk, however, arbitrarily divide the **ranks of the divine (shèngwèi)**, failing to investigate the **source and flow (yuánliú)**, and consider the Jade Emperor as a **secondary deity (cìzūn)**—thus implying there are beings greater than the Emperor. Even more absurd, they compare the **Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)** and the **Buddhas (Fó)** to the **Supreme Emperor (Tàishàng Huáng)**, contradicting the **progressive manifestation (xiān-hòu xiǎnhuà)** of the Jade Emperor. Further, they falsely equate the **divine with different surnames and titles (yìxìng yìhào)** to father and son, their offense being even more grave.\n\nAlas! The world cannot do without the Jade Emperor, just as a life must have its **ancestral lineage (zōngzǔ)** and **parents (fùmǔ)**. To defame the Emperor and establish separate sects is to **abandon one’s ancestral lineage and parents while elevating oneself (shě zōngzǔ fùmǔ ér zì zūn)**. How can this be justified?\n\n**On the Jade Emperor’s Auspicious Title (Yùdì Hào Chēng Lìyì Kǎo):**\n**Lan Caihe (Lán Cǎihé)** said: People know to honor the **Emperor of Heaven (Tiānshì)**, yet they do not recognize the **Jade Emperor’s sacred title (Yùdì Bǎohào)**. Confucians may say reciting it is improper, but do they not know that **great filial piety is to revere one’s parents throughout life (Mò fùmǔ ér xīnchéng)**—is this not the teaching of **Mencius (Mèngzǐ)**?\n\nTo **revere one’s parents with sincerity (mò fùmǔ ér xīnchéng)** makes one a **filial son (xiào zǐ)**. To **invoke the Jade Emperor’s title with sincerity (chēng Dìhào ér xīnchéng)** ensures one will never commit transgressions, making them a **true child of Heaven and Earth (Qiánkūn xiāozǐ)**. To **embody the form and emulate the Dao (jiànxíng wéi xiāo)** is to **submit to Heaven and Earth (tiān dì jiēguī)**, and what greater benefit could there be?\n\n**On the Auspicious Benefits of the *Imperial Scripture (Huáng Jīng)* (Huáng Jīng Lìyì Kǎo):**\n**Zhang Ziyang (Zhāng Zǐyáng)** said: With the rise of **imperial rulers (Dìwáng)**, there must be **imperial institutions (Dìwáng zhì)**. Those who transgress these institutions are rare indeed. Yet, the **Heart Seal of the *Imperial Scripture (Huáng Jīng Xīnyìn)**** is the **essence of Daoist practice (Dàodào Zhīyào)**, embodying it makes one the **Supreme Sage (Zhìshèng)**, far beyond merely avoiding transgressions. If people today do not believe in its benefits, it is because they have not **sincerely practiced its recitation and essence (tǐhuì shìchí wèichéng)**. The wise should ponder this.\n\n**On the *Imperial Scripture’s* Record of Merit and Demerit (Dì Jīng Jiàolù Gōngguò Kǎo):**\n**Zhong Lizi (Zhōng Lìzǐ)** said: The **birth of all beings (Rénwù zhī shēng)** originates from the Dao, all receiving **true essence (Zhēn)** from the **Heavenly Emperor (Tiāndì)**. Thus, if one is **virtuous (shàn)**, their **virtue moves Heaven (Dé dòng Tiān)**, and blessings naturally arrive, even if they are poor and lowly, their **tranquility and joy surpass others (ānlè shèng yú tārén)**, making them the **True Hall of Blessings (Zhēn Fú Táng)**. If one is **wicked (è)**, they **create their own calamity (zì zuò niè)**, and Heaven sends **disasters (Tiān xiàng yāng)**—even if they are rich and noble, their **misfortune and retribution (xiōng jiù)** make them an **active hell (Huódì Yù)**.\n\n**Destiny of blessings and calamities (Huòfú)** is fixed, following the **virtue or wickedness of mortals (rén shàn è)**; the **interaction between humans and Heaven (Tiān rén jiāoyìng)** is swift as **echoes and responses (yǐngxiǎng)**. The deluded do not believe this, so they speak of **merit (Gōnggé)** as follows: **\"Sincerely reciting the *Imperial Scripture (Huáng Jīng)*** in its entirety earns **a thousand kinds of merit (qiān zhǒng gōngdé)**, leading one to ascend to **Heaven’s Hall (Shèng Tiān Táng)**.\"**\n\n**\"Sincerely reciting (Zhēn shìchí)\"** means **unifying inner and outer (nèiwài zǒngyī)**, **words and deeds aligning with the Dao (yánxíng hé dào)**, not merely **uttering scriptures with one’s mouth (wéi kǒu shàng niàn jīng)** but **practicing true goodness in one’s heart (wéi xīnxīn shíshàn)**. Truly well said!\n\n**Wang Lingguan (Wáng Língguān)** said: *\"Why should the skilled hand draw my likeness? Only wish your heart align with mine.\"* If one’s heart can **align with the Heavenly Emperor’s (Xīnxīn hé Tiāndì)**, then **virtue and blessings flourish together (Dé fú bìng miào)**, achieving **true recitation and meritorious deeds (Zhēn shìchí shàn gōng)**. As for the rest who merely **recite scriptures and restrain their mouths while disciplining their hearts (Jǐ kǒu zhì xīn)**, though they may have **faith and merit (fúdé)**, their blessings depend on the **size of their virtue (shàn zhī dàxiǎo)**—this is yet another inferior level.\n\n**On the Demerits (Guògé):**\nThey say: *\"If one does not believe in this scripture, they fall into **heterodox paths (xiédào)***, for their **heart does not align with the Dao (xīn bù hé dào)**, thus becoming a **wicked person (yé rén)**.\"* They also say: *\"To **defame true scriptures (huǐ chán zhēn wén)** is to **fall into hell (shēn duò Dìyù)**.\"* Those who do not believe merely **hear of the scripture’s merits (jīngzhōng gōngdé)**, yet fail to **truly embrace them (xīn shì bù jí)**, are guilty of lesser transgressions. But to **defame the scriptures is to erase Heaven’s decrees (fèi Tiān zhāng)***—their **heart commits great evil (xīn zuò dàxiè)**, their **misfortune and retribution (xiōng jiù)** are boundless, sinking them into **dark and malevolent realms (yīn è zhī dì)**, their crimes unforgivable, thus they fall into **the path of hell (Duò Dìyù Lù)**.*\n\nThey further say: *\"To **slander the Emperor and defame the Sages (Dìshì huǐshèng)**, **abolish the divine abode (fèi shén zhù)**, **tear apart true scriptures (liè zhēn jīng)**, and **persist in wickedness without remorse (wán è wú quān)**, will forever suffer **karmic restraints (yè jìn)**, and their **calamity extends to seven generations (huò jí qī zǔ)**.\"* To **defame and tear apart scriptures (huǐliè jīngwén)** is to **blaspheme the sacred texts (kǒu shàn língzhāng)**, their **words dare Heaven’s authority (yán mà Tiān wēi)**, so their **crime rests upon themselves (zuì zài zìjǐ)**. To **slander the Emperor and tear apart scriptures (Dìshì liè jīng)**, to **indulge in evil without repentance (zòng è bù quān)**, makes one’s **body unvirtuous (shēn wéi bùshàn)**, leaving **endless infamy (yí chǒu wúqióng)**, harming one’s **substance (tǐ)** and **dishonoring one’s kin (rú jīn)**. Even if one were a **filial son or a kind grandson (xiào zǐ cí sūn)**, they could not **redeem this across a hundred generations (bǎi shì bù néng gǎi)**.\"*\n\n「The **karmic faults (guì yè)** of one’s own person—when will they ever cease? The **calamity upon one’s ancestors (zǔ qīn zhī jiù)**—how could they ever be pardoned? If not, then the state establishes laws, and punishing criminals is acceptable. Yet why are there those who **exterminate the three lineages (yí sān zú)** or **destroy the nine lineages (miè jiǔ zú)**? It is because the **crime exceeds the measure (zuì fàn guò zhòng)**, thus extending to one’s relatives. But if this is so, then though the **legal net (fǎ wǎng)** may stretch far, others may still **hold erroneous views of scriptures (yǐ chǒu jīngdiǎn)**, or **recite them without reverence (sòng zhì bù qián)**, or **misinterpret and belittle them (chí niàn éu màn)**, or **arbitrarily alter their teachings (màng yì cái dù)**, or **condemn one while praising another (shì cǐ fěi bǐ)**, or **prefer the latter while disparaging the former (yōu bǐ liè cǐ)**. According to their **transgressions’ severity (guò zhī dà xiǎo)**, there is a **fixed retribution (yīdìng zhī bào)** awaiting them.\n\n*Alas!* The **Imperial Sutra (Dìshì jīng)** is the **law of the present age (jīn fǎ)**. To **disbelieve the sovereign’s law (bù xìn Wáng fǎ)**, the **statutes have clear decrees (lǜ yǒu míng zhāng)**; to **not follow the sacred precedents (bù zūn shèngdiǎn)**, how could **Heaven’s ordinances (Tiān tiáo)** not exist? Lamenting that **the human body is hard to obtain (rén shēn nán dé)**, and the **supreme Dao is difficult to hear (shàng dào nán wén)**, parents labor to give birth to us—**their toil and suffering are the same (láo kǔ tóng)**. Those with **virtue (dé)** bring **blessings to their ancestors (fú zǔ qīn)**, ascending in this very life to the **highest ranks (dēng jiǎ kē)**, and receiving **honors that exalt their kin (fēng zèng xiǎn qīn)**. Those with **faults (guò)** bring **calamity to their ancestors (huò zǔ qīn)**, just as today’s **offspring and descendants (zǐ dì fàn shì)** may be punished for crimes, **and the penalty falls upon the family elders (zuì zuò jiā zhǎng)**. Though **human bodies are equal (rén shēn tóng)**, **good and evil differ (shàn è yì)**; though **parental kindness is the same (qīn ēn tóng)**, **blessings and karmic consequences vary (fú yè shū)**. Why then does a person **not choose goodness but delight in evil (wú shàn zuò è)**, **merely burdening their ancestral lineage (tú yí lèi zǔ zōng)**?\n\nThe **Imperial Sutra’s (Huáng jīng)** teachings on **merit and demerit (gōng guò gé yán)** demonstrate its **truth within the human heart (zhēn jīng zài rén xīn shàng)**. **Pure goodness (chún shàn)** naturally fulfills the **sutra’s merit (jīng gōng)**. The **highest sages (shàng zhì)** act in **harmony with the sutra’s essence (zì hé jīng)**, not relying on mere **verbal recitation (kǒu sòng)**. The **middle sages (zhōng zhì)** **discern the Dao through the sutra (yīn jīng jiàn dào)**, while the **lowly and ignorant (xià yú)** **do not believe even when told (yǔ yán wú xìn)**. Since **highest sages are rare (shàng zhì bù cháng yǒu)**, and **lowly and ignorant few (xià yú yì bù duō)**, the **common folk (zhōng rén)** are vast—**thus the efficacy of teaching and cultivation (jiào huà zhī gōng)** cannot be neglected.\n\nThose who **contemplate this sutra (guān zhì jīng)**—how could they **fail to embody the Jade Emperor’s (Yù Dìshì)** **compassionate guidance of the world (cí bēi dù shì zhī yì)**, and instead **regard it as ordinary (shì wéi fàn cháng)**?\n\nRegarding the **annotations and interpretations of the Imperial Sutra (Huáng jīng jí zhù yì lüè kǎo)**:\nZhōu Xiànlín states:\n*The **Imperial Sutra (Huáng jīng)** speaks of the **true nature of the Dao (dào zhī zhēn)**—what is inherently **divided by one’s innate nature (wú xìng fēn gù yǒu)**. It should **not require elucidation (yí bù xū jiě)**. Most people are **overly concerned (duō lǜ)**, with **varying capacities (zī yǒu gāo xià)**. Those with **partial insights (piān jiàn zhě)** are many, and the **immortals (zhū xiān)** interpret it thus—**not all can fully expound the profound meaning (fēi néng jìn shuō xuán zhǐ)**. This is merely **prepared for later generations’ reconciliation (gū bèi hòu rén zhī zhé zhōng ěr)**.*\n\nRegarding the **differences in the Imperial Sutra (Huáng jīng tóng yì kǎo)**:\nZhāng Zǐfáng states:\n*This sutra originally had **no dual names (bēn wú èr míng)** or **distinction between Highest Sage and Supreme Spirit Jewel (gāo shàng líng bǎo zhī fēn)**. Later scholars **erroneously annotated (cūn rén chuān jiàn)**, **arbitrarily adding or subtracting words (suí yì zēng jiǎn zì jù)**, **forcibly linking texts (qiān hé wén)**, and **utterly lost the original intent (shū shī běn zhǐ)**. Now, upon **examining the Highest Sage and Supreme Spirit Jewel (gāo shàng líng bǎo)****,** they stem from **various immortals’ praise (gè xiān zhēn chēng yáng yǔ)**. Later generations mistakenly **took them as two separate texts (wù zhí wéi èr)**. Here, we **adhere to the Mystic Capital’s (Xuándū)** **definitive analysis (dìng lùn)** and **record the transmitted versions (lù chuán shì jiān)**. Later students **should examine this carefully (jiàn zhì mò tǐ)** and, upon encountering **errors in transcription, transmission, or exposition (yù yú kān xiě chuán jiǎo chā chù)**, **cross-reference with authoritative editions (cóng gōng kǎo jiào)**. Any **external additions of words, phrases, or illustrations (wài tiān wén jù zì huà)** are all **erroneous (é wù)**. **Enlightened ones should not rigidly cling to these (dá zhě wù ní zhí yán)**.*\n\nRegarding the **annotations, interpretations, and transmitted commentaries of the Imperial Sutra (Huáng jīng jí zhù kān chuán shū wén)**:\n**Your humble servant, Zhōu Xuándéng**, a **successor of the Complete Perfection (quán zhēn)** **disciple of the Small Dao Master (xiǎo zhào shēn)**, **sincerely fearful and reverent (chéng huáng chéng huáng)**, **prostrates himself with head bowed (qǐ shǒu dùn shǒu)**, **fasting and purifying himself with a hundred bows (zhāi mù bǎi bái)**, **petitions:**\n\n*Truly, the Dao’s **mystery and effortless nature (miào wú wéi)** **manifests itself through time and circumstances (měi yīn shí ér zhuó jiàn)**; **human hearts have awareness (rén xīn yǒu jué)****,** and thus **should accumulate merit according to the place (yí suí dì yǐ jī gōng)**. Your humble servant, **Xuándéng**, though **of lowly disposition (wéi zhì)** and **the least of the Three Talents (sān cái mò pǐn)**, **aspires to the wondrous law and returns to the Mystic (mù miào fǎ yǐ guī xuán)**. Originally **a Confucian scholar (běn rú háng)**, he **later encountered the Dao (huì dào)**. Upon **first glimpsing the Imperial Sutra (yī dǔ Dì jīng)**, he **received its rare and precious truths (shèng huò zhēn yì)**. He **then meticulously studied each character (jí zhú zì yǐ jīng yán)**, hoping to **grasp enlightenment through its words (jì yīn wén ér liǎo wù)**. But since **the sacred texts lack annotations (shèng diǎn wú zhù)**, **true comprehension is difficult (tǐ rèn wéi nán)**.\n\nYour humble servant **devotedly seeks sincere understanding (shēn zhì fā chóng qián)**, **exploring its multifaceted meanings (bó fāng jiě yì)**. He **compiled the Immortals’ and Saints’ sayings (xù zhuàn xiān shèng gé yán)**, **incorporating them into the Daoist Canon (huì rù Dào zàng hán bù)**. For the **three volumes of the true text (yīn sān juàn zhī zhēn wén)**, he **collected and arranged their sequence (yòng jí xù cì)**; for the **five grades of secret teachings (wù pǐn zhī mì lùn)**, he **listed them under chapter titles (yǐ liè piān míng)**. The **ten volumes (juàn biān wéi shí)** total **six hundred sheets (fú jì liù bǎi)**, **encompassing one hundred and eighteen chapters (zǒng liè yībǎi shíbā zhāng)**, with **over tenfold myriad words (dà luè shí yuè wàn yán)**.\n\nThe **heart-laws of a thousand sages (qiān shèng xīn fǎ)** **shine forth in these volumes (shǔ cè zhāo rán)**; the **vast sufferings and profound principles (hào jié xuán zōng)** **are visible at a glance (jǔ mù rú zài)**. Though your humble servant **cannot yet fathom the secrets of the Highest Sage (wèi néng dú kuī shàng shèng zhī yùn ào)**, he **hopes to at least enable others to witness the most exalted true texts (shì zhòng shí wén)**. **Even a small effort has its effect (cùn láo jì xiào)**; **a good connection may yet endure (liáng yuán ruò cún)**.\n\n**With humble devotion (qiān jí)** to the **auspicious morning (cháo)** and **reverent diligence (qián kè)**, he **provides benefit to those of good faith (zī shàn xìn yǐ xié chéng)**. **The preface of this petition (yù zòu shū cí)**, **presented to the Mystic Judgment (shàng gān xuán jiàn)**, **augments the Emperor and people’s purity (zēng jūn mín qīng jìng zhī fú)** and **pardon the Small Dao Master’s presumption (shè xiǎo zhào jiàn wàng zhī zuì)**. May it **illuminate all realms and directions (shǐ zhū jiè duō fāng)** with the **seventeenfold radiance (shí qī guāng míng zhī zhào chè)**; may it **span past and future (jué jīn qīng gǔ)** and **immerse all in the thirtyfold great vows (shí sān shí dà yuàn zhī táo róng)**. May all **ascend to the Heavy Mystic (zhòng xuán)** and **eternally benefit from the law’s blessings (míng yáng yǒng zhān fǎ lì)**. Though your humble servant’s **sincerity is but a fraction (shǒu shēn xuán zhēng zhī chéng)****,** it **slightly fulfills its purpose (shǎo shēn wàn yī yǐ)**.\n\n**Respectfully submitted (jǐn zòu)**.\n\nRegarding the **meaning, annotations, and chapter arrangement of the sutra (jīng zhù míng yì xù cì kǎo)**:\n*The original text sometimes appears as **one volume (zuò yī juàn zhě)****,** following the **model of the Supreme Ultimate (xiàng Tài jí)**. Others divide it into **three volumes (fēn sān juàn zhě)****,** symbolizing the **Three Talents (sān cái)**. Now, this annotation **comprises ten volumes (jīn zhù zuò shí juàn)****,** representing the **tenfold Supreme Ultimate (shí jí zhī yì)**—for the **Dao’s numbers are complete in ten (dào shù chéng yú shí)**. The **five grades (wù pǐn)** symbolize the **Five Phases (wǔ xíng)**. When the **Five Phases, Four Symbols (sì xiàng), and Eight Trigrams (bā guà)** are combined, they yield **seventeen (dé shí qī)**—all **divisions of the Supreme Ultimate (jiē Tài jí zhī fēn)**. Thus, the **Emperor attains the seventeenfold radiance (Dì yú shí qī guāng míng)**; **Heaven is born (Tiān yǐ shēng)** and **Earth is perfected (dì yǐ chéng)**.\n\nThe **Jade Emperor’s (Yù Dìshì)** **sutra is the **Earth’s (dì)** **curved completion of all things (qū chéng wàn wù)**. Earth’s **numbers are thirty (dì shù sān shí)****,** so the Emperor **manifests thirty kinds of virtue (shì sān shí zhǒng gōng dé)**. The **Emperor’s virtue surpasses the tenfold Supreme Ultimate (Dì dé chāo chū shí jí)****,** hence the **ten titles (jù shí hào)**. After **cultivating for countless kalpas (xiū yì wàn jié)****,** he **embodies the ten thousand virtues (zhōu wàn dé)**. Now, this **six-hundred-sheet annotation (liù bǎi fú zhù)** **mirrors the Fire Scripture’s six hundred chapters (xiàng huǒ jì liù bǎi piān)**; the **one hundred and eighteen chapters (yībǎi shíbā zhāng)** **follow the Emperor’s eighteen hundred precepts (cóng Dì qiān bā bǎi jiè)**. The **tenfold myriad words (shí wàn yú yán)** **reflect the Emperor’s ten thousand wondrous and mystic deeds (xiàng Dì shí wàn miào xíng xuán guāng)**.\n\nAs for the so-called *Imperial Sutra Annotation (Huáng jīng zhuàn)*, your humble servant fears that **the lowly and ignorant (xià yú)** **cannot fully align with the sacred text (bù néng quán qì shèng wén)**. He **summarizes the essentials (jǔ dà yào)** to **instruct others (yǐ zhào rù)**. Knowing this **intent (yì)****,** how could there be **divergent interpretations (bù tóng zhī zhǐ)**?\n\nRegarding **contemplation, recitation, and exposition of the sutra’s precepts and teachings (guān sòng jiǎng shòu jīngdiǎn jiè yì)**:\n**When observing or reciting any sutra (fán guān sòng zhū jīng)**, or **lecturing and transmitting its teachings (huò jiǎng míng shòu jiè)**, one must first **fast and purify oneself (zhāi míng zhěng yī)**, **adorn oneself in proper attire (yī zhuóng)****,** and **reverently place the sutra on a clean table (sù róng qǐng jīng zhì jìng qǐ shàng)**. **Sitting upright and steadying one’s mind (duān zuò dìng zhì)****,** one should **forget both good and evil (shàn è liǎng wàng)****,** **abandon all vehicles (yī chéng bù lì)****,** and **att\n\n**Copying Sutra Precepts**\nFor all who copy the sutras, the ritual observances are the same as for recitation. With a rectified mind and a true pen, it is not for the sake of fine calligraphy—this very act is the Dao itself.\n\n**Distinguishing Similar and Divergent Names of the Sutra**\nCarefully examining *Baopuzi* states: *\"The Highest Above\"* refers to the sovereign of all sentient beings, reaching the utmost limits of Heaven—its height is unmatched, corresponding to the Buddhist term *non-retrogression* (不退转之地).\n\nThe *Jade Emperor* is the most revered among the Saints and the most noble among the Gods. All Buddhas and Holy Teachers, all Celestial Emperors, thus earn the title *Jade Emperor*.\n\n*Lü Dongbin* says: *\"Dao supreme and peerless is called Emperor.\"*\n\nThe *Most High Emperor* is boundless in benevolence and trust, surpassing all previous sages in perfect virtue and beauty—praise for Him is endless.\n\nHis station is in *Yuqing* (玉清), proclaiming the transformations of *Yuan Shi* (元始), hence the title *Jade Emperor*.\n\n*Han Xiang* says: *\"The Original Conduct\"* recounts the Jade Emperor’s sacred roots and the cultivation of wondrous practices.\n\n*The Collected Sutra* gathers the five wondrous utterances of *Yuan Shi* into one text, showing posterity the true path of practice.\n\n*Guanshan* says: *\"Only Heaven is supreme,\"* for the Jade Emperor’s abode is the highest Heaven, surpassing all others, hence *\"Highest Above.\"*\n\nMen see the Jade Emperor’s grandeur and assume His virtue is absolute, beyond mortal reach. Yet the Holy Dao knows no division—I stand equal to the Most Holy.\n\nThe Emperor’s majesty, His marvels—these are achieved through conduct.\n\nThus, *Tian Shū* Zhang Shangling transmitted this text, urging men to emulate the Sage and attain True Reality.\n\nThe clear decree states: *\"The Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct and Collected Sutra\"* is meant for men to observe, attain enlightenment, trace the roots of merit, follow the Most Holy, and thus become *Shang Zhen* (上真).\n\nLater, it was also called *\"The Taishang Dongxuan Lingbao Scripture\"*—speaking of the Great Beyond measure, the Highest Beyond reach, hence *Taishang*. It expounds the primordial *De* and *Dao*, serving as the eternal foundation of all scripture. It penetrates the Three *Jing* (景), revealing profound mysteries, hence *Dongxuan*. The essence of *Xuanling* is the eternal treasure of Heaven and man, hence *Lingbao*.\n\nIn essence, the scripture clarifies the Dao, and the Dao belongs to my very self. If man fulfills his nature and attains his destiny, comprehending this Dao, tracing its roots, and embodying it in conduct—then he may enter Sainthood.\n\n**Belief in Scripture and the Discrimination of Ascension and Depravity**\nFrom *Taiji*, man is born and transformed. Heavenly paradises and hellish realms are detailed in the scriptures—yet the world does not believe. Is this mere fabrication?\n\nThough death returns to emptiness, what does not perish is the *hun* (魂) bound by deeds. *Bo You* became a ghostly calamity; *Zi Chan* believed him, and the Master did not deem it false. Are there no hells?\n\nPurified rebirth returns to the cycle of creation; heavenly paradises exist as well. Yet blessings cannot be begged for, and karmic retribution cannot be evaded. Heavenly paradises and hells are shaped by human intent.\n\nIf one believes in these doctrines by name but does not cultivate virtue, he invites disaster himself. Even if he speaks daily of retribution, what good will it do?\n\nFor those who recite the scriptures, there are pure-hearted incantations—these are omitted here. Since earlier teachings aligned the heart with the Dao, this very recitation is the true incantation, so their texts are not recorded.\n\nThe original *Huangjing* (皇经) first listed thirty-six sacred titles, following the meaning of *\"thirty-six from Heaven.\"* Now the scripture retains only ten precepts—why? The ten titles represent the ten extremes, used as the Emperor’s designation. It is not a matter of omitting due to brevity or inclusion. The observer should ponder this carefully.\n\n**Commentary on the *Highest Above Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct and Collected Sutra***\nThis meaning is the *Dongxuan Lingbao*’s paired exposition—later generations should not doubt it.\n\n**Long Kneeling and Reverent Adoration**\nThis scripture expounds the Jade Emperor’s wondrous conduct as revealed by *Yuan Shi*, so those who recite it must kneel in long reverence, offering sincere devotion.\n\n**Supplication to the Three Pure Ones**\nI humbly address the Three Pure Realms—the supreme, unmatched Three Pure Ones. Knowing the Dao’s height and the Three Pure’s grandeur, I sincerely aspire, surrendering body, spirit, and destiny, ascending to the True Heart.\n\n**Gazing Up in Reverence**\nI supplicate the *Yuqing* (玉清), the *Shangqing* (上清), and the *Taiqing* (太清).\n\nThe Three Pure Realms are the most exalted:\n- *Yuqing* is the sacred realm of *Yuan Shi*,\n- *Shangqing* is the true realm of *Lingbao*,\n- *Taiqing* is the immortal realm of *De* and *Dao*—\nthe Three Pure Ancestors, the Great Celestial Worthy.\n\n**Supplication to the Great Luo Heaven**\nThe boundless celestial expanse where life originates.\n\n*Lü Dongbin* says: *\"The Jade Emperor’s abode is the sovereign of the three thousand great thousand worlds, never retrogressing. Supreme beyond compare, hence *Great Luo* (大罗).\"*\n\nThe *Xuan Qióng* (玄穹) Master—vast and solemn—is the sovereign of all celestial assemblies.\n\n**Supplication to the Three Pure Realms and the Attendant Divine Multitude**\n*Zhang Ziyang* says: *\"Attendant\"* means standing beside. *\"Divine\"* refers to the lofty, ineffable realm beyond sight or hearing. *\"Multitude\"* means all—\nthe *Nine Divine Ones of Primordial Heaven*, the *Heavenly Saints of Later Heaven*, all gods, Buddhas, bodhisattvas, *Arhats*, and *Vajrasattvas*—all are present here.\n\n**The Marvelous Dao Beyond Conception**\nThe most marvelous, supreme Dao—\nthe highest vehicle—\ncannot be grasped by thought,\ncannot be spoken of,\nis beyond conception.\n\n**Entering the Mysterious Gate**\n*Zhang Zifang* says: *\"Entering\"* means attaining through true knowledge and practice. *\"Mysterious Gate\"* is the gate of Daoic principle.\n\nThe myriad marvels of profound mystery are difficult to enter, yet through gradual enlightenment, one enters the Mysterious Gate.\n\nThis is what *Mencius* called *\"dwelling in it securely, then drawing from it deeply,\"* and the scriptures say: *\"Hearing and thinking alone, without practice, leads to emptiness.\"*\n\n**The Sutra’s Marvelous Sound and Profound Essence**\n*\"Loft\"* (抉) means to decide, to extract. *\"Profound Essence\"* is the unfathomable mystery.\n\nThis marvelous scripture extracts divine inspiration from the true realm—this is the extraction of profound essence.\n\n**Guiding the Dust-Ensnared to the Path**\n*Yuan Shi* expounds the marvelous scripture, extracts the profound essence, and guides the dust-bound, lost souls out of the sea of suffering, freeing them from their karmic bonds.\n\n**I Now Purify the Three Karmas**\n*\"I\"* refers to those who read or recite the scripture. *\"Three Karmas\"* are bodily, verbal, and mental deeds. *\"Purify\"* means sincere devotion, permanently abandoning these deeds.\n\n*(The recitation continues with) mouth and heart in unison.*\n\nThe devotee who recites this scripture speaks with true sincerity.\nWith mouth chanting and true heart receiving,\nI humbly pray for boundless compassion—\nMay the Great Compassion open to accept my plea.\n*\"Compassion\"*—one variant reads *\"Reverence\"*—but *\"Compassion\"* is correct.\nIn reciting this scripture, I humbly pray that Yuan Shi, the Jade Emperor, and all the Celestial Worthies extend their boundless compassion, reveal their merciful countenance, and accept my supplication.\nIf *\"Reverence\"* were used, it could not carry the meaning of the preceding three petitions.\n\nMay the radiant compassion illuminate my humble unworthiness,\nMay the Divine Hearing listen to my devotional chant.\nMay the sacred light of all Saints shine upon my sincere, lowly heart,\nAnd may the Divine Hearing attend to the sounds of my offerings and recitation.\nMay my recitation resound through the Ten Directions—\nWhen I recite the scripture, may the Dharma-sound echo through the Ten Directions, so that all beings in the Ten Directions may hear and believe in the Great Law.\n\nMay all my wishes be fulfilled,\nAs the scripture describes.\nMay I attain enlightenment through this scripture and cultivate the Dao,\nFulfilling all virtuous aspirations,\nJust as the scripture recounts the Jade Emperor’s wondrous deeds across kalpas.\n\nFrom this point onward, may I gradually progress in cultivation,\nAchieving the Great Dao and serving the Celestial Saints.\nFrom this moment, may I steadily advance in my practice,\nRealizing the Great Way and paying homage to the Immortals and Saints.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and entrust myself—\nThough my devotion may not yet be perfect,\nIf my heart is not fully devoted, even a slight regret would not be true surrender.\nIn reciting this scripture, I vow eternal sincerity without wavering in my practice, hence the phrase *\"With utmost sincerity, I bow and entrust myself.\"*\n\nTo the Pure and Refined Celestial Realm—\nYuan Shi, the Most Exalted and Unparalleled,\nThe Sovereign of the Central Heaven,\nSupreme over Immortals and Buddhas,\nWhose abode is eternal and unspoiled—this is the Pure and Refined Celestial Realm.\nThe Celestial Palace of *Qingwei*. *(To be clarified in subsequent revelation.)*\n\nWithin the **Yùluó Xiāotái** (Jade Emperor’s Lofty Hall),\nAt the **Jǐngshàng** (Supreme Pinnacle) of the utmost heights,\nA heaven within the heavens, radiant and fragrant with divine light,\nSerene and truly

(Teachings),\nSo deep that it cannot be fully exhausted—\nThe heavens encompass myriad phenomena, profound and unfathomable,\nYet **Yùqīng** (Jade Purity) stands above all heavens.\nThus it is spoken of as above the **Sēnluó Jìnghóng**.\n\nThe **Míngxiǎn** (Manifested Form) is its **Fànxiàng** (Dharma Manifestation),\n**Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn** (The Most Exalted Sovereign of Primordial Beginning),\nAs the **Zōng** (Founder) of the **Sānjiào** (Three Teachings),\nIlluminating and transforming all beings,\nWhose wonders are inexhaustible—\nThis is the **Míngxiǎn** (Manifested Form) of the **Yìfàn

Mysterious),\nBreaking the hindrances of **Wúyǒu sèkōng** (Non-existence, Form, and Emptiness);\nExpounding and propagating widely,\nIlluminating and elucidating the **Zhìzhēn Xuánzōng** (Ultimate True Mysterious Principle).\nBreaking the worldly hindrances of **wúyǒu sèkōng** (non-existence, existence, form, and emptiness).\nThe **wú** (non-existence) is the principle of non-duality;\nThe **yǒu** (existence) is the indulgence in life;\nThe **sè** (form) is the attachment to existence;\nThe **kōng** (emptiness) is the failure to transcend **wúyǒu** (non-existence and existence).\n\n*Yuánshǐ* (Primordial Beginning) in this **Sūtra** (Scripture),\nIlluminates the **Zhēn Xuán** (True Mysterious),\nNot confined to the **Sān guān** (Three Observations),\nNor trapped in

Low).\nRescuing and elevating all beings of emotional karmic types, freeing them from dust,\nNot discriminating between ancient and modern, saints and fools—\nAll can practice the **Dàodào** (Dao/Way).\nThis is the **Mìao fǎ** (Marvelous Law) of **Zhēnyī Wú'èr** (True Oneness, Non-duality),\nSevering all distinctions of wisdom and folly, high and low.\nMarvelous applications beyond

\"下记切\") means *continuation* (to inherit).\nThe **Língbǎo** (Soul-Treasure) body embodies the **Yuánxíng Huà** (Primordial Conduct Transformation),\nthus ascending to inherit the **Yuánshǐ Xūhuáng** **Dàotǒng Shìxì** (Dao/Way lineage and succession).\n\nIt surpasses the **roots and origins** (gēnmiáo) of the **Xīnà Yùguó** (Western Jade Realm).\nThe **Sūtra** examines **Xīnà Yùguó** in Shaanxi’s **Xīnà** (Western Jade),\nthe birthplace of the **White Sovereign** (Báidì) in the west—\n**Língbǎo** precedes all **saints’** (shèng) transformations,\nthus it is said to transcend the **roots and origins** of **Xīnà Yùguó**.\nOne must not conflate **Yuánbái** (元白) with **Báidì** (白帝).\nSome say *supercedes* (chāo) should be *inherits* (shào),\nbut the **Celestial Sovereign** (Tiānzūn) is not the **roots and origins** of **Xīnà Yùguó**—incorrect.\n\nEntering the **shǔmǐ zhū** (glutinous millet pearls),\nabsorbing the **quánzhì** (complete) essence of **Zhēn Xuán** (True Mysterious).\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** (Tiānzūn) enters the **shǔmǐ Xuánzhū** (glutinous millet Mysterious Pearls).\nThis is the **Confucian** **jiǔróng Tàijí** (nine transformations of the Great Ultimate)\nand the

inherently unsaid,\nbut the **Sūtra** (经) provides the **path of practice** (xiūxíng jìnglù).\nIt is like the **fishing net** (qiān) for catching fish,\nor the **hare’s foot** (tí) for trapping hares—\ntools that cannot be permanently held,\nhence the **Sūtra** is likened to **qiāntí** (fishing nets and hare’s feet).\nThe **miàodé** (Marvelous Virtue/Power) is beyond thought,\nand the **shéntōng** (Divine Abilities) are beyond imitation.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign**’s (Tiānzūn) **miàodé** (Marvelous Virtue/Power) defies contemplation,\nand **shéntōng** (Divine Abilities) cannot

(Shìfǎ) across **twelve thousand heavens** (Wàn èrqiān tiān).\nThe **Supreme Sage** (Tàishàng) has traversed kalpas,\nmanifesting throughout the **Three Thousand Great Thousands** (Sānqiān

her spirit in a dream within the void—\nthe **Holy Mother** dreamed the **Dao Lord** (Dàojūn) handed her an infant,\nthus giving birth to the **Jade Sovereign**.\nThis was a **divine dream** (Shéndòng) within the void,\nthough its auspicious marvel was extraordinary.\nThe **Dao Lord** bestowed the **Jade Essence** (Yùzhì) in a hazy, distant realm.\nHer **compassionate and yielding

in repentance**—\n**long kneeling**, prostrate upon the earth,\nwith **sincere humility and utmost reverence**.\nOr, if one says **long kneeling** refers to **prolonged bending of the knees**,\nit is not so.\n\n**Repentance**—\nto **confess one’s own faults** and vow to **forever extinguish this evil**.\n**Remorse**—\nto **regret past transgressions** and vow to **self-reform**,\nas when a **culprit surrenders** himself.\n\nFrom **beginningless kalpas**,\nwe, your **subjects** (as those who recite the scriptures and are like the virtuous),\nhave been **covered by ignorance and

to **delusive thoughts**—\nthus called **ignorance and afflictions**.\nFrom **ignorant thoughts**, the mind is **troubled and restless**,\n**hateful and vexed**, losing its **pure heart**—\nthus said to **cover the True Mind**.\nThe **True Mind** remains constant,\nthough not lost, **ignorance and afflictions** cause it to **darken and be bound**,\nas though **covered by things unseen**.\n\n**Now cast off**, our **original truth** is revealed.\n\nWe have **habitually committed** the **Three Evil Karmas**—\n**habitually**, not just **exclusively** practicing killing, theft, and licentiousness.\nEven **killing thoughts**, **theft intentions**, or **licentious desires**\ncannot be **utterly severed** in awareness—\nthus, we **habitually** engage in evil.\n\nThis **body** is the **Three Evil Karmas**.\n\nWe **habitually employ** the **Four Evil Tongues**—\n**two-faced speech**, spreading strife with **forked tongues**;\nor **groundless fabrications**, uttering false words;\nor **shriveled, insidious flattery**, decorating speech with **beautiful yet deceitful language**,\n**perverting others’ ears** with **empty talk**, not based on truth.\n\nWe **slander** the

**Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism**.\n\nWe **quarrel and disrupt**, **alienating kin and friends**—\n**quarreling** is not **physical fighting**,\nbut **inciting false disputes** with **provocative words**,\ndisrupting **harmony among kin and friends**,\n**separating** the **concord of families**.\n\nThe **three preceding lines** all describe the **Four Evil Tongues**.\n\nWe **indulge** in the **Three Poisons of Greed, Anger, and Delusion**—\nor **desire without satisfaction**, greedily seeking without end;\nor **resentment and vexation**, ceaseless **anger and hatred**.\nOr **mired in

**concealing resentment and jealousy**, not fearing the **sacred scriptures**, is **Negligent Arrogance**.\nThe sixth: **yielding to lust and craving**, not safeguarding the **body**, is **Slothful Arrogance**.\nThe seventh: **unrelenting aversion**, not attaining the **Pure Lands**, not revering the **Divine**, is **Contemptuous Arrogance**.\n\nSome say the **seven emotions**—**joy**, **anger**, **sorrow**, **fear**, **love**, **aversion**, and **desire**—are the **Seven Arrogances**.\nBut all arise from **joy**, **anger**, **love**, and **aversion**, which **exacerbate the Three Poisons**—**greed**, **anger**, and **delusion**—and thus cannot be **counted among the Seven Arrogances**.\nThis view is incorrect; **Liu Langran’s** explanation is right. **Examine carefully**,

Volume\n\n---\n\n**Supreme Jade Emperor’s Original Scripture Collection**\n**Volume One**\n\n**Divine Prowess of the Celestial Palace of Qingwei (First Section)**\n\nThe **Ancestral Celestial Master** says:\nThe **Celestial Palace of Qingwei** transcends the Three Realms, purifying all defilements, its void and mystery luminous and wondrous, subtle beyond measure. Dwelling within the Three Pure Realms, it is the Great Celestial Palace, where the Jade Emperor resides. The **Primordial Origin** expounded this scripture here, governing this wondrous realm with supreme and mysterious efficacy, its transformations boundless and unfathomable. This scripture expounds its essence as the **highest section**; only divine insight and profound wisdom can comprehend it—hence, it is called **\"Divine Prowess (First Section).\"**\n\n**Scholar’s Note:** Ancient texts define *divine* as \"mysterious transformations beyond measure,\" and *prowess* as \"pervasive without omission.\" It is the crown of the Five Sections and the essence of the Three Pure Realms. The **Dan Platform** aligns with this—once understood, the entire scripture becomes clear.\n\n**Divine Prowess (First Chapter)**\n\nAt that time, the **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable**—\n*\"At that time\"* refers to the initial manifestation of the **Boundless Mirror**, the commencement of **Great Mystery’s** transformation, the auspicious confluence of all saints, the moment this scripture was to be expounded.\n\n*Yuan* (元) means **great**, **first**; *Shǐ* (始) means **origin**. The enlightenment of all saints began with the **Primordial Origin**.\n\nThus, it is called the **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable**.\n\n**Within the Celestial Realm of Qingwei**—\n*(Explanation of Qingwei Heaven provided earlier.)*\n\n**Divine Prowess (First Chapter continued)**\n\n**The Celestial Capital of Jade and the Golden Gate**\nThe **Celestial Sovereign of Purple Clarity and White Purity** spoke:\n*\"The abode of the Jade Emperor is built of white jade as its capital (京) and yellow gold as its gate (阙), not the mundane gold and jade of mortal realms, but divine manifestations of wondrous transformation—azure heavens resplendent with celestial splendor, adorning the sacred precincts of the court. Hence, it is called the **Celestial Capital of Jade and the Golden Gate**.*\n\n**The Seven-Treasured Mystic Gardens**\nThe **Celestial Sovereign of White Purity** spoke:\n*The Seven Treasures are: jade of emerald hue, stages of luminous jade, palaces of lapis lazuli, walls inscribed with dragon motifs, white jade citadels, vermilion gates, and golden radiance that pierces all darkness. Another account names them: glass, crystal, pearls, agate, coral, amber, and conch shells. The **Mystic Gardens** are the secret precincts of the **Double Mystery**.*\n\n**The Jade Emperor’s Palace and Ascended Seat of Radiance**\n**Zhang Liang** spoke:\n*\"In the Primordial Origin epoch, the Celestial Venerable ascended to preside over the Jade Emperor’s Palace, ascending the **Great Seat of Radiant Clarity and Mystic Sovereignty**.*\n\n**With the countless assemblies of the Boundless**\nHe expounded the **Sacred Treasure of Pure and Undivided Oneness**.\"\n\n**Zhang Liang** spoke:\n*\"When the Primordial Origin ascended the seat, the boundless true saints gathered in assembly. Thus, it is said: ‘With the countless assemblies of the Boundless,’ proclaiming the **Mystic Treasure of Divine Clarity**, pure and unstained, the supreme secret of **True Oneness**, unobstructed and unmixed, the **Undivided Law-Gate**.\"*\n\n**The Ten Directions’ Gathering Explanation**\n*\"The human **Primordial Spirit** is the essence of life and destiny. The Great Celestial Venerable, within the Qingwei Heavenly Realm, inherently possesses this. The **Celestial Capital of Jade and the Golden Gate**, adorned with the Seven Treasures, is inherently possessed by all. The human body’s **yin-yang vital essence, spirit-qi, and refined essence** are the Seven Treasures of the self. Thus, the **Lingting Mystic Gardens** harmonize heaven and humanity.*\n\n*When the Heavenly Sovereign is serene and composed, the **Seat of Radiant Clarity** may be ascended, and all limbs obey in unison. Concentrating the spirit and aligning with the Dao, one becomes the Celestial Venerable’s seat, joining the Boundless assemblies in proclaiming the **Sacred Treasure of Pure and Undivided Oneness**.*\n\n*Yet the Dao has no fixed form—when one awakens with clarity, one attains the secret realm of subtlety, as straightforward as a great road. To enter it is natural.*\n\n*Hence, it is called the **Law-Gate**.\"*\n\n---\n**Divine Prowess (Second Chapter)**\n\n**At that time**—\n*The moment when the Primordial Origin ascended the seat.*\n\n**The Celestial Sovereign Emperor**\n*\"Emperor\"* denotes unparalleled exaltation, hence the appellation.\n\n**With the Celestial True Ones, the Flying Heavenly Great Saints, the Boundless Divine Kings, the Spirit Boys and Jade Girls—nine hundred million in number—observing strict purity and bearing sacred banners, standing in attendance.**\n\n**Zhang Liang** spoke:\n*\"‘With’ means ‘together.’ ‘All’ refers to the multitude. The Jade Emperor, in concert with the celestial immortals and divine true ones, ascended in divine transformation and wondrous prowess. The **Flying Heavenly Great Saints**, the **Three Thousand Great Realms**, and the countless gods of the Boundless—those of the heavenly and earthly planes—along with the **Minor Yang Divine Qi** that responds to invocation, the **Spirit Boys** who attend with reverence, and the **Minor Yin Divine Qi** that transmits decrees, the **Jade Girls** who proclaim transformations—totaling nine hundred million divine beings.*\n\n*Without revealing their divine radiance, they returned to the Primordial Origin’s essence, observing strict purity and holding sacred banners, standing beside the Primordial Origin’s Seat of Radiance.\"*\n\n**The Heavenly Marshal Tian You** spoke:\n*\"Within the human body, there is the **True Sovereign, the Primordial Spirit**, unrestrained in its divine communication. There are also the **Flying Heavenly Great Saints**, whose spirit-qi guards the body. Even in the smallest interstices, there are the **Boundless Divine Kings**, the **Minor Yang’s Mystic Light**, the **Minor Yin’s Divine Motion**, and the **Spirit Boys and Jade Girls**. When the heart aligns with the Dao, the **Nine Hundred Million**—the great numbers of yang vigor—are also present, and the body’s spirits pay homage to the Primordial.*\n\n*‘Observing strict purity’ means the mind is undivided; ‘holding sacred banners’ means the body is without sluggishness.\"*\n\n**Master Guan’s Perspective** spoke:\n*\"Humans are akin to heaven and earth—when clear and unadulterated, the **Primordial Spirit** ascends to the pole. Indeed, it is like **Yan Hui’s heart-fasting** or the **legalist’s bearing of the banner**, singing in reverence without division, thus obeying the Heavenly Sovereign and attaining the Dao.\"*\n\n---\n**Divine Prowess (Third Chapter)**\n\n**Thereupon,**\n\n**Divine Prowess (Third Chapter)**\n\nAt this auspicious gathering,\nThe Jade Sovereign, knowing the hour was near, displayed the **Six Perfections** before the assembly, emitting a vast radiant light that illuminated all the **Primordial Dream Palaces** of the boundless heavens. Every realm trembled in response, and the ten directions of the infinite worlds became as transparent as **crystal and glass**, with no obstruction whatsoever.\n\n**Master Zhuang** remarked:\n*\"The Jade Sovereign, aware that the time for the **Mystic Light’s** revelation had arrived and that the moment to propagate the **Law** and transmit the **Scriptures** was at hand, thus manifested the **Six Perfections** before the grand assembly. He emitted the most universal and luminous light, illuminating the boundless heavens, the **Dream Palaces** of all the celestial deities and divine spirits, and every sacred realm they inhabited. All were shaken and awestruck. The infinite worlds of all the **Sages and Buddhas** in the ten directions became as clear as **crystal and glass**, their light penetrating and revealing all without hindrance or concealment.\"*\n\n**Master Zhang Wuzhang** explained:\n*\"The **Six Perfections**—**Vision-Perfection**, **Hearing-Perfection**, **Mind-Touch-Perfection**, **Mind-Meeting-Perfection**, **Foresight-Perfection**, and **Pre-illumination-Perfection**—are what the Buddhist tradition calls the **Six Divine Eyes** and such.\"*\n\n**Master Zhuang** further clarified:\n*\"**Dream Palaces** are the abodes of the celestial emperors and deities—marvelous and resplendent in the heavens, not tainted by dust, never decaying, and unshakably firm. The mortal eye cannot perceive them, hence the term **Dream Palace**.\"*\n\n*\"Every sacred realm is the domain where the deities reside. These realms encompass all worlds—not merely human domains, but also celestial realms, which are also called **worlds**.\"*\n\n*\"Though **crystal** has form and light, it reveals all that it bears; **glass**, though flawless, leaves nothing unseen. The Jade Sovereign’s light penetrates all realms, illuminating even the most hidden—how could there be any obstruction? The comparison is made to help those who might not grasp the meaning directly.\"*\n\n**Master Guan** observed:\n*\"Human nature is inherently luminous, yet when the **Primordial Spirit** strays from its master, obstructions arise. Sometimes one hears without seeing, sees without hearing, knows without speaking, or speaks without knowing. Sometimes one’s perception is clouded between self and others, or confused between past and present—this is the failure of the **Six Perfections**.\"*\n\n*\"If one penetrates the **Nature and Command**, and the **Primordial Spirit** governs its rightful place, then one’s illumination will encompass both heaven and humanity, revealing all within and without. The **Jade Reservoir**, the **Dan Platform**, the **Yellow Court**, and the **Mystic Domain**—these are the original sites of the body’s spirits, where the **Celestial Enclosure** naturally shines. All is illuminated without hindrance, just as **crystal and glass** reveal all without concealment.\"*\n\n*\"Indeed, the **Way** is inherently luminous, yet clarity is not easily attained. One must not be deceived by what is not yet known, nor confused by what is already known. Neither too early nor too late—true awakening is most difficult. If one can emulate the Jade Sovereign, observing the opportune moment to manifest light and renewing it daily without ceasing, then the **Great Illumination** will never dim, and the **Way** will endure.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Divine Prowess (Fourth Chapter)**\n\nThe **Sages of the Ten Directions**, riding upon **Five-Colored Jewel Wheels**, **Lingyu Spotted Jade Chariots**, **Nine-Colored Mystic Dragons**, and **Ten-Sublime Feathered Canopies**, arrived in procession.\n\n**Master Lei Zu** noted:\n*\"The **Ten Directions** encompass the four cardinal points, the four diagonal corners, and the realms above and below. The **Sages** are the divine and holy assemblies of the ten directions.\"*\n\n*\"Witnessing the Jade Sovereign’s radiant light, they ascended their **Five-Colored** jewel-wheeled carriages, **Lingyu** jade chariots, **spotted emerald** banners, **Nine-Colored** mystic dragons, and **Ten-Sublime** feathered canopies.\"*\n\n**Master Bai Yutian** elaborated:\n*\"The **Five Colors** are **blue, yellow, red, white, and black**. **Wheels** are the dual wheels of a chariot. **Chariot** refers to the vehicle itself. **Banner** is the collective term for imperial processional standards. The **Nine Colors** are **blue, red, yellow, white, black, purple, green, the Supreme Mystic hue, and the Golden-Luminous hue**. The **Mystic Dragon** bears the dragon’s form and light but no corporeal frame. **Ten-Sublime** means surpassing all extremes—divine and wondrous, like the feathered canopies of auspicious phoenixes and cranes.\"*\n\n*\"The **Scriptures** state: **Feathered Canopy** refers to a high-stemmed feathered fan. Another account says that when the divine and holy emperors travel, they bear **auspicious feathered standards** as their canopy. The latter explanation is more profound.\"*\n\n**Master Guan** reflected:\n*\"Humans, endowed with the **Primordial Spirits** of the **Five Phases**—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—each possess their own **treasures**. When the **Dao** is perfected, these treasures attend the **Law-Vehicle**. If one can silently pay homage to the **Heavenly Sovereign**, imitating the celestial order, then within one’s body, the spirits gather, and the **Rectified Qi** manifests in splendor. The **Jewel Wheels**, the **Lingyu True Chariots**, the **Emerald Banners**, the **Nine-Qi Mystic-Transformed Dragons**, and the **Ten-Sublime Unmatched Feathered Canopies**—these were all within one’s own person. Why should they belong only to the celestial and divine?\"*\n\n*\"Alas, only the truly enlightened understand this.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Divine Prowess (Fifth Chapter)**\n\nWith **Qilin dancing** and **phoenixes singing**, their **harmonious hymns** resounded—**Divine Consorts** scattering **jewel blossoms**, **Golden Boys** wafting **auspicious mists**, reciting **profound hymns** as they floated through the void.\n\n**Master Xu Qing Tian Shi** described:\n*\"As the **Sages** proceeded, the **Qilin** led in dance, and the **Auspicious Phoenix** harmonized in song, their melodious cries blending in perfect rhythm. The **Celestial Consorts** scattered **jewel flowers**, while the attending **Golden Boys** emitted **auspicious mists**. They chanted **profound hymns**, guarding the divine procession as they floated through the empty heavens toward the **Imperial Capital**.\"*\n\n**The Ten-Direction Assembly** remarked:\n*\"When the divine emperors journey, **Spirit Boys** and **Flower-Gathering Maidens** sing in attendance, while the **Qilin** dances and the **Phoenix** sings, imitating the **Qilin’s** and **Phoenix’s** movements. Hence, it is said: *‘Their hymns resound in harmony.*’ This interpretation is overly forced.\"*\n\n*\"The divine procession includes **Qilin** and **Phoenixes**, akin to the **celestial steeds** that accompany the Emperor today. Moreover, the **Scriptures** state: *‘When the Heavenly Emperor travels, dragons soar and phoenixes dance.’* This reflects the **Supreme Harmony** of the celestial scene.\"*\n\n*\"It is also said: *‘Dragons and leopards long howl in the mountains and forests,’*—this is the **harmonious hymn** of the true **Qilin** and **Phoenix**. Otherwise, why would the **Sage Emperor Shun** compose music on **Qishan Mountain**, summoning the **Phoenix’s** rites and causing all beasts to dance?\"*\n\n*\"Examining the **Scriptures** with this in mind, the earlier explanation is correct.\"*\n\n「My humble view holds: When a person cultivates the Dao, silently aligning with the Imperial Will, honoring the Primordial Sovereign, the body embodies **Supreme Harmony**. The **Heavenly Resonance** sings in response, the **Mysterious Veins** settle in ease, and the demeanor is as refined as the **Qilin’s** dance or the **Luan-Feng’s** song—**séng-séng**, a joy to behold.\n\nThe **Yang Essence** radiates in splendor, the **Yin Luster** reveals itself in bloom, as though the **Divine Consorts** scatter flowers and the **Golden Boys** waft incense. The **Secret Music** and **Mysterious Melodies** are the **Heavenly-Human Praises**, the **Piercing Chapters**, resonating with the **Primordial Spirit**. It is as if one rides the void on the wind—this too is the **Holy Assembly** ascending in midair to the Imperial Gate.\n\nThis is the shared essence of all, yet only those of resolve may verify it.\n\n**Chapter on Divine Penetration (Section 1):**\nAt this time, the **Brahman-Heavens**, all **Golden Immortals**, **Great Vehicle Bodhisattvas**, the **Fourfold Hosts**, and the **Eight Divisions**—bathed in this radiance—ascend upon **golden, jade, and flying-cloud palanquins**, their **Nine Haloed Auras** scattering wondrous brilliance. They gather in **Celestial Celebration**, the **Three Celestial Lights** exhaling fragrance, **Eightfold Harmonies** swirling in incense, circling the Dao’s path. A shower of **Wondrous Flowers** descends like clouds, covering the assembly before them.\n\n**Zi Fang** expounds: At this time, all **Brahman-Heavens**, the **Enlightened Golden Immortals**, the **Great Awakened Ones** who have grasped the **True Great Vehicle Path**, the **Fourfold Hosts** of **celestial generals, male and female deities**, and the **Eight Divisions of Heavenly Beings**—bathed in this luminous glow—ascend upon **golden-hued, jade-carved palanquins borne by flying clouds**, adorned in **Nine-Haloed Robes**, their **Mysterious Scenery** effulgent. They celebrate the **Auspicious Sky**, the **Fourfold Gatherings**—the **Celestial Assembly of Merit**, the **Divine Assembly of Felicity**, the **Assembly of Timely Convergence**, and the **Assembly of Fated Alignment**—not solely the gathering of the **Fourfold Hosts**. The **Eightfold Harmonies** swirl around the Dao’s path, the **Holy Assembly** circling in reverence, and the **Wondrous Flowers**, like clouds descending, entirely cover the grand assembly. Or it may be said that the **Holy Hosts descend like clouds**, though this is overly forced.\n\n**Ma Gu** elucidates:\n- **Brahman-Heavens**: The **Supreme Precious Forest**, the **Jade Palaces** unseen in the mundane world, their hidden mysteries unfathomable. Hence, they are called **Brahman-Heavens**.\n- **Golden Immortals**: Immortals of **Unbreakable Gold**.\n- **Great Vehicle Bodhisattvas**: Such as **Guanyin the Great Sage** and others.\n- **Fourfold Hosts**: **Immortal Hosts**, **General Hosts**, **Male Deities**, and **Female Deities**. Or it may include **Celestial Deities and Demons**, all encompassing. It does not refer to **secular monks and nuns**. For mortal bodies cannot easily ascend to the heavens, hence these four are not mentioned.\n- **Eight Divisions**:\n  - **Divine Division** (神部),\n  - **General Division** (将部),\n  - **Celestial Human and Heavenly Laborers Division** (天人天丁部),\n  - **Vajra Division** (金刚部),\n  - **Dragon King Division** (龙王部),\n  - **Night-Light Female Attendants Division** (夜光女使部),\n  - **Asura Division** (修罗部),\n  - **Rākṣasa Division** (夜叉部).\n\n- **Nine Haloes**: **Emerald Halo**, **Rainbow Halo**, **Purple Halo**, **Crimson Halo**, **Cloud Halo**, **Mist Halo**, **Auspicious Light Halo**, **Luminous Splendor Halo**, and **Universal Treasure Halo**. The **Nine-Colored Mysterious Light** flows with this wondrous scene—this is the radiance of their **Divine Robes**, though it may also signify the **Mysterious Comeliness** of their forms, not solely the garments they wear.\n- **Celestial Celebration**: A **Joyous Day**, or the **Celebration of the Divine Sky**.\n- **Fourfold Gatherings**: The **Assembly of Celestial Merit**, the **Assembly of Divine Felicity**, the **Assembly of Timely Convergence**, and the **Assembly of Fated Alignment**. Not solely the gathering of the **Fourfold Hosts**.\n- **Circling the Dao’s path**: The **Eightfold Harmonies** swirling in reverence, or the **Holy Assembly** circling in reverence.\n- **Like clouds descending, covering the assembly**: The **Wondrous Flowers** descending like clouds entirely cover the assembly. Or it may be said that the **Holy Hosts descend like clouds**, though this is overly forced.\n\nMy humble view holds: The **Spirits of the Human Body** are manifold. If the **Primordial Spirit** does not govern them, the myriad spirits will not manifest their **Numinous Virtue**. Only those who cultivate the **True Way**, silently paying homage to the **True Lord**, will see the **Ten Thousand Spirits** in reverent attendance. The **Mysterious Treasury’s Light** reveals its **Hundred Wonders**, each converging in display. When the **Primordial Spirit** gathers at the fore, all **Auspicious Omens** align, like **Auspicious Clouds** covering all—then I and the heavens are as one, undivided.\n\n**Chapter on Divine Penetration (Section 2):**\nAt this time, the **Imperial Light** illuminates all the **Heavens**, descending to illuminate the **Ten Directions’ Boundless Worlds**, aligning with the **Playful Metropolis** realm. All mortal realms, even those near the **Nine Heavens**, are connected and intimately linked. Even the **Boundless Worlds below**, their **mountains, ridges, valleys, and ravines**, stretch flat as the palm—**Six Directions** are near, the **Three Realms** not distant.\n\nThe **Celestial Treasures’ Pavilions and Halls** dot the mortal realm like stars, **Precious Jade and Rare Gems** arrayed in splendor along the clouded paths. **Seven-Treasured Railings** mark the boundaries, **Jade Trees and Immortal Flowers** gleam with **Jewel-Like Luster**, their **Mysterious Splendor** radiating from the **Elixir Fields**, while **Lingzhi mushrooms and sacred grasses** spread in lush coverage.\n\n**The True Person of Heaven** declares: At this time, the **Jade Emperor’s Light** shines upon the **Thirty-Six Heavens of this world** and the **Three Thousand Great Realms of the Heavens**, descending to illuminate all the **Boundless Worlds of the Ten Directions**, all rendered luminous, identical to the **Playful Metropolis** where the Jade Emperor resides. All mortal realms within these **Dharma Realms**, bathed in this light, face no obstruction—even those near the **Nine Solar Transformations of Heaven**. The **Heavens, Earth, and Mortal Realms** are interconnected, intimately linked. Even the **Boundless Worlds below**, with their towering mountains, jagged ridges, murky valleys, and ravines, stretch flat as the palm. The **Six Directions** are intimately connected, the **Three Pure Realms** not distant.\n\nThe **Heavenly Treasures’ Pavilions and Halls** appear in the mortal realm like stars, **Precious Jade and Rare Gems** arranged in splendor along the clouded thoroughfares. **Seven-Treasured Railings** demarcate the paths, **Jade-Branched Treasure Trees** and **Immortal Wondrous Flowers** gleam with **Jewel-Like Luster**, their **Mysterious Splendor** radiating from the **Elixir Fields**, while **Lingzhi mushrooms and sacred grasses** spread in lush, continuous coverage.\n\n**Shi Xing’s Annotation on *Lin Kao*:** The **Human Sovereign’s** dwelling is called the **Capital**. The **Jade Emperor’s** abode surpasses all heavens, unseen by the world, hence **Playful Metropolis**. Normally, the **Heavens are clear and the Earth is murky**, the **Divine and the Mortal** disconnected—this is not intimacy. But when the **Imperial Light** shines through, the **Divine Mechanisms** link in wonder, and thus the **Heavens and Mortals** connect, growing intimate.\n\n**Nine Heavens**: The **Nine Upper Realms of the Thirty-Six Heavens**, not merely nine.\n\nThe mountains rise high and grand—thus they are called mountains.\n**Ling** are great hills, **mounds** the vast mounds.\n**Pō** refers to uneven land, **bǎn** the jagged ridges of mountains.\nDeep and long is called a **gully**.\nMountains flanking water are **ravines**.\nWhere water flows is a **stream**.\nA great void in the mountain is a **valley**.\n**Miǎn** means level and flat.\nThe earth, with its mountains, waters, valleys, and ravines, is inherently uneven.\nYet when the **Imperial Light** covers and illuminates, its wondrous intent permeates, making all worlds’ lands level.\n\n**Qióng** is fine stone; **guī** refers to jade-like gems.\nWhen they cluster in profusion, they are called **arrayed**.\n**Yúnqú** are the celestial pathways at the heavens’ summit.\nHorizontal barriers are called **rails**; vertical ones, **screens**—just as the world’s defenses are arranged.\n**Chén** is the radiant brilliance of flowers.\n**Zhūbǎo** are true pearls and gems.\n**Dāntián** is the **Elixir Field**, the sacred **Dan Platform** of the **Playful Metropolis**.\n\n**Shi Xing’s Annotation:** The human body contains **Heaven and Earth**; the **Yin and Yang** essence remains ununited, so the upper and lower are distant and estranged. But when the **Primordial Spirit** commands the **Light**, the **Heavenly Radiance** blazes forth, and **Earth-Heaven harmony** prevails, the high and low bend in accord, all drawing near in wondrous unity. The treasures inherent in the body, revealed in divine splendor, differ not from those above. The **Elixir Field**, where the **Spirit** resides, displays marvelous scenes—sacred grasses and **Lingzhi** flourish in lush abundance, while **Jewel-Like Flowers** bloom without need for distant seeking.\n\n**Chapter on Divine Transformation:**\nAt that time, all in the lower realms see the **Heavenly Strings’** wondrous music from the **Pinjiao Heavens**, revolving with the **Imperial Light**, naturally resounding in harmony. They also see **Luan cranes** singing, **Ling phoenixes** harmonizing, their cries rising in rhythmic response; **Xuan dragons** dance, **Ling unicorns** coil, soaring and circling at the celestial summit. The **Heavenly Treasure Flowers** scatter and drift, filling every path.\n\nThen, both **commoners and sages** are astonished, the hidden and dark illuminated. **Heavenly beings and mortals** rejoice and leap in delight. Even the unenlightened and **Dao-seekers** ascend, gazing upward at the **Effulgent Jewel Platforms** of countless **kalpas**, downward at the **Purple Clouds** veiling the **Mile-Cloth Boundaries**. All beings in these worlds attain **Dao-qi transformation**—the aged with wrinkled faces rejuvenate, their hair turning **deep indigo**, their complexions **crimson**. The young and vigorous, the infants, grow ever more radiant, their forms luminous and flawless. All sufferings vanish, all are liberated, serene and joyous. Across the land, songs of praise celebrate the **Great Peace**.\n\nThe **Emperor of Eternal Life** declared:\nWhen the **Imperial Light** shines universally, all beneath the heavens see the **Heavenly Strings’** secret melodies from the **Pinjiao Heavens**, revolving with the **Imperial Light**, their sounds naturally resonant. They also see **Luan cranes** singing, **Ling phoenixes** harmonizing, their movements rhythmic and precise; **Xuan dragons** dance, **Ling unicorns** spiral, soaring and circling at the celestial summit. The **Heavenly Treasure Flowers** scatter and drift, filling every path.\n\nAt this moment, both **commoners and sages** are astonished, the hidden and dark illuminated. **Heavenly beings and mortals** rejoice and leap in delight. Even the unenlightened and **Dao-seekers** ascend, gazing upward at the **Effulgent Jewel Platforms** of countless **kalpas**, downward at the **Purple Clouds** veiling the **Mile-Cloth Boundaries**. All beings in these worlds attain **Dao-qi transformation**—the aged with wrinkled faces rejuvenate, their hair turning **deep indigo**, their complexions **crimson**. The young and vigorous, the infants, grow ever more radiant, their forms luminous and flawless. All sufferings vanish; the **Three Thousand Great Realms**, old and young alike, are all liberated, serene, and joyous. Across the land, songs of praise celebrate the **Great Peace**.\n\n**Lei Men’s Envoy** said:\nThe **Heavenly Strings’** music is **gold**, the first of the **Eight Sounds**. Its **Dharma-tones** are **primordial gold**, uncorrupted. All harmonies blend without discord, the essence of **sound and rhythm**. Some say it is **naturally attuned**, a sound the world rarely hears—thus, **Pinjiao**. Others say the **Great Constructor** wields the **Great Balance**, and **Dao-transformation** flows naturally in **Great Harmony**; the **Heavenly Music’s** marvel is the **Great Constructor’s** work—hence, **Pinjiao**.\n\n**Yǒngyuè huānxīn**—to leap and dance in joy, hands and feet moving in delight.\n**Rèn** means **eight chi** (a measure of height).\nThe **Heavenly Jewel Platforms** endure through countless **kalpas**, unwearable—thus, **Effulgent Kalpa-Platforms**.\n**Yǎnguān** is to lift one’s gaze; **fǔmiǎn** to lower one’s head and look.\n**Zǐyún míluó**—the **Yellow-Lao Treasure Realm**—not merely what is seen beneath the **Jewel Platforms**, but also the **comprehensive vision** of ascent and descent.\n\n**Gàn** is a deep **indigo** tinged with **crimson**; **gànfà** is what is now called **green temples**.\n\n**Shi Xing’s Annotation:** The human body holds **Yin and Yang**; the **upper qi** is pure, the **lower qi** turbid. If the **qi** is stagnant and unharmonized, the **upper** remains unseen and unheard, leading to decay, weakness, and exhaustion—thus, the breath fades.\n\nBut when one aligns with the **Great Dao**, the **Primordial Secret** is revealed, the **Luminous Marvel** shines, and the **True Sounds** and **True Transformations** are heard and seen. The **Pinjiao melodies**, the **Ling phoenixes and cranes**, the **Xuan dragons and unicorns**—all display their wonders. **Jewel Flowers** drift in splendor, filling the world with beauty. The **Yin and Yang qi** harmonize in perfection, the **Spirit** astonished. All darkness merges into light, the upper and lower in perfect accord—thus, the **Heavenly beings and mortals** leap and dance in joy.\n\nThe **Yin** dissipates and returns; the **wondrous intent** ascends to the **Mystic**. Thus, even the **commoners and Dao-seekers** all ascend. Gazing upward at the **Jade Jewel Platforms**, downward at the **Boundless Mystic Realm**, the land is rich, the people at peace, the **qi** harmonized, the **Spirit** serene. The weak grow strong, the stagnant flow freely; the deficient become abundant. **Tendons and marrow** are transformed, **Great Harmony** preserved. The body thrives in perfect balance, rejoicing in this **wondrous transformation**.\n\nThe aged return to youth, the young grow ever more radiant—\nthe world sings in joy of the **Heavenly Emperor’s** virtue and **Great Harmony**!\n\nAh, this is the true **dharma**! The enlightened taste its sweetness.\n\nAt that time, the **Divine Perfections** manifest in nine chapters:\nthe **Mystic Wind** billows far and wide,\nthe **Ten Thousand Qi** (*wànqì*) surge with **Heavenly Grace**,\n**Heaven trembles** and the earth **splits**—\n**dry bones reanimate**, drowned corpses rise with **flying souls**,\nall regaining their forms.\n\nThe **Yin** realm of **Yùdū** (*酆都*), encircled by iron walls,\nits endless night of **Nine Abysses** (*jiǔyōu*)—\nat that moment, all is shattered.\n**Suffering souls** of the **Hell Realms** (*dìyù*) are reborn in **Pure Lands** (*zhūtian*).\nThe torments of **Three Evil Paths** (*sān’è dào*)—\n**Hell, Hungry Ghosts** (*èguǐ*), and **Animal Realm** (*chùshēng*)—\nare all dissolved.\n\nThen, the countless guilty,\nby this **radiant virtue** and **Dao-light** (*dàoguāng*),\nare born anew in the **Ten Directions’ Great Celestial Palaces**.\n\n**Wei Boyang** says:\nWhen the world rejoices in **Great Harmony**,\nthe **Heavenly Emperor’s** virtue and **Mystic Wind** billow far,\nthe **Wondrous Qi** (*miàohuà wànqì*) surges,\nand **Heavenly Grace** spreads.\n\n**Heaven’s** **Yang** vitality flourishes, vigorous and robust—\n**Heaven trembles** in its **Mystic Vehicle** (*xiányú*).\n**Earth’s** **Yin** opens to **Great Destiny** (*chéngyùn*), gentle and yielding—\n**Earth splits** in its **Soulful Depths** (*língyōu*).\n\n**Dried bones** return to life, not merely **revived** (*jiǎgǔ zàiqǐ*),\nand **drowned corpses** (*chénshī*)—\nthose whose **souls** have fled and **forms** decayed—\nawaken to **Dao**, knowing the **True**, and **Yang** renews their bones.\nAmong mortals, these are the **Immortal Ones** (*rénzhōng zhī xiān*), whose bones regrow.\n\nThe **soul** (*pò*) in the living body\ndelights in death, feasting on sacrifices,\nyet if one does not **realize the Dao** (*bù míngdào*),\n**earthly attachments** (*chénshí*) bind them,\n**Spirit** departs with the body, **souls** vanish and **soul-essence** (*pòjīng*) scatters.\nSome cling to their own illusions,\nothers fall into **karmic prisons** (*yuànyù*).\nWhen **soul-essence** rises and **fantasies** dissolve,\nevil **karmic residues** (*èniè*) flee with the **soul**.\n\nYet the **Yin** realm of **Yùdū** (*tiěwéi Yùdū*), its iron walls unyielding,\nall is broken by the **Heavenly Emperor’s** **Mystic Light** (*yùdū zhēnguāng*).\nWhere no **Heavenly Light** penetrates,\nin the endless night of **Nine Abysses** (*jiǔyōu hēiyù*),\nall is rent asunder by radiance.\nThe **Yin** realm’s iron walls collapse instantly—\n**suffering souls** ascend to **Heaven**,\nthe torments of the **Three Evil Paths** dissolved.\n\nThen, the guilty who receive this **radiant virtue**,\nleaning on this **Dao-power** (*dàoli*),\nare born anew in the **Ten Directions’ Great Celestial Palaces**.\n\nFor mortals in this world,\nthis is a treasure to ponder.\n\nThe **Divine Perfections** unfold in ten chapters:\nAt that time, the **Heavenly Emperor** divides His **Body of Law** (*fǎshēn*),\npervading all the **Great Celestial Palaces** (*dàtian gōng*).\nEach palace naturally manifests—\n**white jade** as the capital (*jīng*),\n**gold** as the gates (*què*),\nthe **Seven Treasures’ Mystic Gardens** (*qībǎo xuányuàn*) resplendent with the **Great Light Hall** (*dàguāngmíng diàn*), its **radiant seat** (*guāngmíng zuò*) gleaming.\n**Banners and flags** (*chuángjié fānshǎng*) unfurl,\n**rare treasures and marvelous flowers** adorn every place.\n\nThen, the **Heavenly Emperor** with His divided **Body of Law**,\nthroughout these realms—\nin the **white jade capital** (*báiyù jīngzhōng*),\nwithin the **golden gates** (*huángjīn quètíng*),\nupon the **Seven Treasures’ Mystic Gardens** (*qībǎo zhuāngyán xuányuàn*),\nall as He abides—\nuniversally proclaims the **path of purity and liberation**.\n\n**Zhōnglí Shìjūn** (*钟离帝君*) says:\nWhen the **Great Light** is unleashed,\nthe **Heavenly Emperor** divides and manifests His **Body of Law**,\nreaching all the **Great Celestial Palaces**.\nEach palace naturally reveals itself—\n**white jade capital**, **golden gates**,\nthe **Seven Treasures’** adorned **Mystic Gardens** (*qībǎo zhuāngyán xuányuàn*),\nall as the **Heavenly Emperor’s** own dwelling.\n\nThe **Great Light’s Mystic Hall** (*Dàguāngmíng Xuándiàn*), fully adorned with the **Great Light’s Treasure Seat** (*Dàguāngmíng bǎozuò*), wields the **Mystic Law Banner** (*Xuánhuī fǎchuāng*), its **auspicious canopy** (*jiéyān huágài*) and **divine pavilions** (*fánshì*) unfurled—\nwith **exquisite celestial treasures** and **marvelous heavenly flowers**,\npervading all the **Great Celestial Palaces** (*Zhōngdà Tiānyōng*).\n\nAt that time, the **Heavenly Emperor** manifests His **wondrously divided Body of Law** (*miàofèn zhī shēn*), abiding throughout all the **Great Celestial Palaces**.\nHis **divine transformation** (*shénhuà*) fills the **White Jade Capital** (*Yùjīng*), the **Golden Gates** (*Jīnquè*), and the **Seven Treasures’ Mystic Gardens** (*Qībǎo Xuányuàn*).\nHe ascends the **Great Light’s Hall** (*Dàguāngmíng Diàn*) and takes His place upon the **Treasure Seat of Light** (*Guāngmíng Zuò*).\nAll the **celestial deities** (*zhūshén*) seated there are radiant with **divine light**.\n\nThe **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Emperor** (*Yuànshǐ Yùdì*) manifests the **Treasure Seat of Law** (*Fǎbǎo Zuò*).\nIts light is most wondrous, boundless in grandeur,\nineffable in divinity, surpassing all measure—\nexceeding even the **Buddhist Law King’s Seat** (*Fójiā fǎwáng zuò*).\nTherefore, the **Heavenly Emperor**, in His **divinized Body of Law** (*huàshēn*), ascends this seat\nto universally proclaim across the **Ten Directions** (*shífāng*)\nthe **true pure** (*zhēnqīng*) and **true clean** (*zhēnqìng*) **path of awakening and transcendence** (*wùjiě chāotuō zhī dào*).\n\n**Manifestation** (*yǎn*)—\n**manifestation and illumination** (*yǎnmíng*), **setting forth its meaning** (*chén qí yì*).\n\n**Limited Perspective** (*Guǎnjiàn*) says:\nThe **Primordial Spirit** (*yuánshén*) of humankind—\n**spiritually penetrating**, unrestrained,\nreaching everywhere without hindrance—\nis fundamentally akin to the **Heavenly Emperor’s wondrous transformation** (*miàohuà*).\nThe **Purple Treasury** (*Zǐfǔ*) and **Elixir Platform** (*Dāntái*)—\nare fundamentally the same as the **celestial halls of the deities** (*shén gōng*).\nThe **Auspicious Reishi** (*Ruìzhī*) and **Numinous Medicines** (*Língyào*)—\nare fundamentally the same as the **heavenly marvelous flowers** (*tiānshàng qíhuā*).\n\nYet, humans are ensnared by worldly gains (*shìlì*),\ntheir **Primordial Spirit** (*yuánshén*) losing its master (*shǐzhǔ*).\nThus, they cannot **circulate freely and penetrate thoroughly** (*zhōuliú chègòu*),\n**manifesting numinous power wherever they touch** (*chùchù chénglíng*).\nThey forfeit their **true purity and tranquility** (*qīngjìng zhēn*), unable to attain the **path of liberation** (*jiětuō zhī dào*).\n\nIf one **preserves the True** (*bǎozhēn hé dào*) and **reverently honors the Divine Sovereign** (*mòlǐ shénwáng*),\nthen **spiritual movement becomes unrestrained** (*língyùn pǔtōng*),\npervading the entire body, filling all space—\njust as the

**Great Light’s Hall** (*Dàguāngmíng Diàn*) and the **Treasure Seat of Light** (*Guāngmíng Zuò*).\n\nWhen **qi is harmonized** (*qì hé*) and **pulses are unobstructed** (*mài chàng*),\n**divine light moves** (*guāng dòng*) and **celestial clouds rise** (*xiá yáng*),\nthis is the **Mystic Law Banner**, the **auspicious canopy**, and the **divine pavilions** (*fǎchuāng jiéyān fánshì*).\n\nThe **numinous growth of sacred herbs** (*shénzhī zhī xiù*)—\nagain, these are the **heavenly marvelous flowers** (*tiānshàng qíhuā*).\n\nWhen the **Primordial Spirit** (*yuánshén*) **ascends in divine

**Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens** (*Língfēi Yùnǚ*).\nThis is not solely referring to the **Emperor’s consort** (*Dìhòu*).\n\nThese **Jade Maidens**—\ntheir **complexion and bearing** (*yánróng xiōngróng*) are **exquisitely beautiful** (*mèimiào*).\n**Maiden** (*xiōu*)—beauty.\n**Upright** (*duān*)—solemn and proper.\n**Adorned** (*lì*)—luxuriant and radiant.\n**Unique** (*qí*)—divinely marvelous, rarely seen.\n**Surpassing** (*tè*)—transcending all beauty, **unmatched in the world** (*shìwú bǐlún*).\n\nWith **heavenly treasures adorning their sacred form** (*tiānzhēn zhuāngyán shēnxiàng*),\nthese **celestial maidens** (*Tiānshàng fēi*)—\n**mystic light** (*Xuánguāng*) and **divine transformation** (*shénhuà*)—\n**exquisite treasures adorning their form** (*miàobǎo zhuāngyán*), their **physique and bearing** (*qítǐ qíróng*)\nare **unseen in the world** (*shìsuǒ wèijiàn*).\n\nTheir **speech and voice** (*yányīn*) are **clear and penetrating** (*qīngmíng tōngchè*).\n**Speech** (*yán*)—speech and language.\n**Voice** (*yīn*)—sound and tone.\n\n**Clear** (*qīng*)—distinct and lucid.\n**Penetrating** (*chè*)—pervasive and resonant throughout.\n\n**Subtle and wondrous liberation** (*wéimiào jiětuō*)—natural fragrance:\nThe **celestial maidens** (*fēi*) attain enlightenment, achieving **great liberation** (*dà jiětuō*).\nTheir **mystic mechanisms** (*xuánjī*) are unfathomable, their **divine subtlety** (*shénmiào*) immeasurable.\nNo artificial contrivance is needed—**naturally fragrant** (*zìrán xīnxiāng*).\nYet the source of this fragrance is unknown—hence, **subtle and wondrous** (*wéimiào*).\n\nThis fragrance is **aromatic and rich** (*fēnfù*):\n**Aromatic** (*fēn*)—beautiful qi spreading and dispersing.\n**Rich** (*fù*)—profoundly fragrant and abundant.\n\nIt pervades all **celestial realms of supreme bliss** (*jiémào lètǔ*):\n**Pervasive** (*zhōu*)—comprehensive and all-encompassing.\n**Extensive** (*biàn*)—broadly manifest.\n**Supreme** (*jí*)—most exalted.\n\nIn the **great celestial palaces** (*dà tiān gōng*), where **jade maidens** (*yùnǚ*) serve as **manifestations of the Jade Emperor** (*yùdì huàshēn*), this fragrance does not cease at one place but spreads throughout all **worlds and heavens**, creating **blissful realms without suffering** (*wúkǔ lètǔ*).\n\nThe **great earth** (*dàdì*)—speaking of mountains, rivers, and worlds.\nA **blessed realm** (*fúchù*)—wherever there is a world, there is birth and formation, hence **blessed realm**.\n\nSome say that through **reverence and sincere faith** (*gōngjìng jīngxìn*), one may then hear this **marvelous fragrance** (*yìxiāng*).\nAll worlds receive the **radiance of the Jade Emperor** (*yùdì guāng*), generating faith, and thus encounter the **celestial maidens’ wondrous fragrance** (*língfēi yùnǚ miàoxiāng*), hence **blessed realm**.\nThis is also correct.\n\nAll beings of the **Six Paths** (*liùdào*), upon hearing this fragrance, universally attain **enlightenment and liberation** (*kāiduò zhīhuì*).\nThe **Six Paths** (*liùdào*)—**heavenly path** (*tiāndào*), **human path** (*réndào*), **demonic path** (*módào*), **hellish path** (*dìyùdào*), **hungry ghost path** (*èguǐdào*), **animal path** (*chùshēngdào*).\n\nIf those in the **heavenly path** (*tiāndào*), including all celestial beings (*tiānrén*), hear this fragrance, their **five decayed and four ugly forms** (*wǔshuāi sìchǒng*) are permanently eliminated, and their **celestial blessings** (*tiānfú*) are enhanced.\n\nIf those in the **human path** (*réndào*), including kings, ministers, and common folk, hear this fragrance, they attain the **longevity bliss of humans and heavens** (*rén tiān chángshòu zhīlè*).\nIf their bodies perish and they transcend, they attain the **path of shell-shedding and corpse-resurrection** (*tuōké sǐjiě zhīdào*).\n\nIf those in the **demonic path** (*módào*), all demons, hear this fragrance, they find rest in celestial palaces, free from the suffering of battle and strife.\n\nIf those in the **hellish path** (*dìyùdào*), all guilty souls, hear this fragrance, they escape hell’s torments and attain the bliss of a **pure land** (*jìngtǔ*).\n\nIf those in the **hungry ghost path** (*èguǐdào*), all hungry ghosts, hear this fragrance, they become sated, free from hunger and thirst.\n\nIf those in the **animal path** (*chùshēngdào*), all suffering beasts, hear this fragrance, they escape animal suffering and attain the bliss of **wisdom and clarity** (*zhìhuì cōngmíng*).\n\nThe **Sage of Rescue from Suffering** (*Jiùkǔ Tiānzūn*) says:\nAll beings in the **Six Paths**, upon hearing the **celestial maidens’ natural fragrance** (*língfēi zìrán zhīxiāng*), universally receive the grace of **enlightenment and liberation** (*kāihuà bádù*).\n\nThe **Six Paths** (*liùdào*)—paths like roads, where beings undergo **cyclical rebirth** (*lúnzhuǎn*) within six realms, hence **Six Paths**.\n\nFirst, the **heavenly path** (*tiāndào*): Heaven has **thirty-six names**, with the highest four heavens called **seed-citizens** (*zhǒngmín*), where **seven treasures and nine august celestial beings** reside. The **Buddhist teachings** call this the **non-regressing realm** (*bùtuì zhuǎn zhīdì*).\n\nBelow the **seed-citizens**, there are the **four exalted secret heavens** (*sìchóng mìtiān*), which the **Buddhist teachings** call the **four Brahma heavens** (*sìfàn tiān*).\n\nBelow the **exalted secret heavens**, there are the **four forgetful-form heavens** (*sìwàng xiàng tiān*), which the **Buddhist teachings** call the **four *jhāna* heavens** (*sìqián tiān*), i.e., the **formless realm** (*wúsè jiè*).\n\nBelow the **forgetful-form heavens**, there are the **eighteen heavens of the form realm** (*sèjiè shíbā tiān*).\n\nBelow the **eighteen heavens of the form realm**, there are the **six heavens of the desire realm** (*yùjiè liù tiān*).\n\nOne world contains **thirty-six heavens**, all worlds being the same.\n\nThe **four kinds of celestial citizens** (*sìzhǒng mín tiān*)—**void and wondrous existence** (*xūwú miàoyǒu*), **mystic transformation and divine spirit** (*miàohuà xuánshén*)—are **eternally uncorrupted**, inhabited only by **highest sages and true immortals**, with no celestial beings. They are not counted among the **heavenly paths**.\n\nThe **four exalted secret heavens**—**slightly defiled yet pure**, **partially transformed yet not divine**, **not yet attaining the Great Vehicle**.\nThough they belong to the **human path** (*réndào*), even the **great eon** cannot spare them from decline.\n\nThe **formless realm** (*wúsè jiè*), **form realm** (*sèjiè*), and **desire realm** (*yùjiè*)—\nAll **celestial beings** (*tiānrén*) are **tall and majestic**, their forms like **white silver**, not dependent on sunlight or moonlight for illumination, yet **self-luminous**.\nThe **day-moon heavens** (*rìyuè tiān*) have beings **five *li*** in height; higher realms increase gradually, reaching **a hundred *yojanas*** in stature (*yóushù zhīgāo*), with one *yojana* being **forty *li***.\n\nThe **Dao scriptures** say: **\"Exceeding the abode\"** (*yúshè*), they wear **heavenly robes** (*tiān yī*) weighing **six *catty*, two *qian*, and five *fen***.\nTheir heads are crowned with **natural pearl diadems** (*zìrán zhūguān*), their eyes do not blink (*mù bù shùn*), their heads do not bow (*tóu bù fǔ*), they stand without leaning (*lì bù yǐ*), their eyes shed no tears (*yǎn wú lèi*), and their bodies know no fatigue (*shēn wú kùnpi*).\nIf they fail to awaken to the **Great Vehicle** (*dàchéng*), when their **celestial blessings** (*tiānfú*) are exhausted, their **pearl diadems shatter**, their eyes weep in rain (*mù shùn yǔ lèi*), their bodies bend and weary (*shēn qū xíng pi*), and the **five decays and four ugly forms** (*wǔshuāi sìchǒng*) manifest.\n\nIf one receives the **natural fragrance** (*zìrán xiāng*) of the Dao, with **sincere faith** (*jīngxìn*) and **reverent devotion** (*gōngjìng*), and awakens to its **subtle and wondrous origin** (*miào xiāng zhī yóu*), they will **suddenly attain harmony** (*dùn qì dàdào*) with the Great Way, not needing to seek this fragrance from without, and thus achieve **enlightenment** (*liáo wò*). This is called **the able hearer** (*néng wén*).\n\nThe **five decays and four ugly forms** (*wǔshuāi sìchǒng*) are **permanently eliminated** (*yǒng dé xiāochú*). **永** (*yǒng*) means **eternal** (*eternal*). **终** (*zhōng*) means **final** (*final*). When one is **finally freed** (*zhōng miǎn*) from the suffering of decay and ugliness, their **celestial blessings** (*tiānfú*) are **turned to increase** (*zhuǎn zēng*). **转转进益** (*zhuǎn zhuǎn jìn yì*), their blessings grow without bound—**never exhausted** (*bù tuì jìn*).\n\nHuman paths vary: there are **youth and age, male and female** (*yīnyáng lǎoshào*), there are **noble and ignoble, poor and rich** (*guìbiàn pínfù*), and there are **sages and fools, wise and dull** (*shèngxián zhìyú*). Without attaining the Great Way, their **lifespan is limited** (*shòu suàn bù cháng*), and death comes **with great difficulty** (*sǐ zhī shèn nán*). Their **corpse cannot transform** (*shī bù néng huà*).\n\nIn every realm, **emperors, ministers, and all officials—great and small—along with the countless common people** (*zǎoshì zhūmín*). A **million** (*qiān wàn*) is called a **myriad** (*zǎo*), and **庶** (*shì*) means **the masses** (*the masses*). **兆庶** (*zǎoshì*) refers to all people, **extreme in number** (*extreme in number*).\n\nIf one can receive the **natural fragrance** (*zìrán xiāng*) and **awaken to the Great Way** (*liáo wò dàdào*), they will also **skillfully perceive its refined subtlety** (*xīn miào*), and thus attain the **joy of boundless longevity** (*wú guǎi chángshòu zhī lè*) in the Dao of humans and heavens. Even if they perish, they will **mysteriously escape the mortal coil** (*mì miào tuō qì ké*), **transcend the body** (*shī jiě xiān huà*), and achieve **immortal transformation** (*xiān huà*).\n\n**脱壳** (*Tuō ké*) means **to shed the physical shell**—whether through **sitting ascension** (*zuò tuō*) or **standing ascension** (*lì wáng*), or by **seizing another’s rebirth** (*tóu tāi duó shè*). **尸解** (*Shī jiě*) means **corpse dissolution**—either when **this body dies** (*cǐ yǐ sǐ*) and another **manifests in the world** (*xiǎn shēn yú shìjiān*), with both **corpse and soul departing** (*shī hún bìng qù*); or when one **feigns death and ascends** (*jiǎ sǐ ér shēng*).\n\nFor all **paths of demons** (*móudào*), the demonic kinds vary. **唂嘶啰与** (*wū sī luó yǔ*)—like the **Asuras** (*xiūluó*) and **Rakshasas** (*guǐní*)—**contend with the Heavenly Sovereign** (*tiān dì zhēng héng*), **disturbing celestial officials** (*dòu luàn tiān guān*).\n\nAll demonic paths either **delight in warfare** (*hào zhànzhēng*), **create illusions and terrors** (*zuò huàn lì*), or dwell in **restlessness and perpetual turmoil** (*jū chù bù ān, cháng wú xiūxī*). If such demons hear the **natural wondrous fragrance** (*zìrán miào xiāng*), and **awaken to the Dao’s true nature** (*néng wò dàozhēn*), then they will **abandon evil and follow righteousness** (*gǎi xié cóng zhèng*), dwell in **tranquility** (*jū chù ānrán*), and **guard their inherent stations** (*shǒu qí sù wèi*). In the **separate celestial ranks** (*tiān bié guān*), they will no longer **take pleasure in contention, disturbance, or warfare** (*lè fēn zhēng, dòu luàn zhànfá zhī kǔ*), and thus **each attains rest and respite** (*gè dé xiūxī*).\n\nThose who suffer in **battle and war** (*dòu zhàn kǔ*)—**wounded in contention** (*dòu luàn bì shāng*), **killed in battle** (*zhànfá bì shā*)—**mutually triumph and defeat** (*hù shèng hù bài*), **becoming foes in endless cycle** (*jiāo wéi kòu chóu*)—thus it is said they suffer. **Each attains rest** (*gè dé xiūxī*), for though their **spirit does not harm demons** (*shén suī bù qīn móu*), if they are **disturbed by demons** (*wéi móu suǒ luàn*), they will **respond and subdue them** (*yìng biàn fú móu*).\n\nNow, when these demons hear the fragrance and awaken to its subtlety, dwelling in peace without strife, their **spirit also finds no cause for action** (*shén yì wú shì*). **Spirit and demons alike are at rest** (*shén móu xī ān*), hence it is said that **each attains rest and respite** (*gè dé xiūxī*).\n\nIn all realms, the **hells** (*dìyù*)—though not limited to one name—are called **Changdu** (*Qīngdū*), **Blood Lake** (*Xuèhú*), **Blood Pass** (*Xuèxiá*), **Frigid Ice** (*Hánbīng*), **Flame Chariot** (*Huǒchē*), **Mountain of Knives** (*Dāoshān*), **Forest of Swords** (*Jiànshù*), **River of Love** (*Àihé*), **Restraining Mind** (*Zhìxīn*), **Iron Bed** (*Tiěchuáng*), **Blade of Wind** (*Fēngdāo*), **Iron Hounds** (*Tiěgǒu*), **Bronze Serpents** (*Tóngshé*), **Crucible of Boiling Iron** (*Liáo huò*), **Sawing Asunder** (*Jújiě*), **Grinding** (*Mó*), **Flaying and Picking** (*Bōtì*), **Plow of Mud** (*Ní lí*), **Tongue-Tearing** (*Bá shé*), and **thus up to the thirty-six hells** (*yǐjí sānshíliù yù*).\n\nAll **suffering souls** (*shòuzuì zhūhún*) in these hells are **inherently difficult to free** (*běn nán lí dìyù qīuxíng zhī kǔ*). If they hear this **natural fragrance** (*zìrán xiāng*), they will **awaken and transcend** (*néng liáo wò, suí dé chāotuō*), **escaping the hells’ torments** (*chūlí dìyù zhūkǔ*), and **reborn in a land of pure bliss** (*dé shēng qīngjìng lètǔ*).\n\nFor **hungry ghosts** (*èguǐ*) and **exhausted souls** (*lìjié qiónghún*) long bound in the **ghostly realm** (*guǐjí*), some have **narrow necks and swollen bellies** (*xì jǐng dà fù*), others **great heads with shrunken waists** (*shǒu dà fù xiǎo*), or **constricted throats** (*yān hóu bì sè*), or **consume charcoal and smoke** (*shí tàn yīn yān*), or **dine on molten copper** (*cān róng tóng*), or **swallow iron pellets** (*dàn tiě wán*), enduring **countless lifetimes without taste of water** (*lěi shì bù wén jiāngshuǐ*), **never encountering food** (*bù yù yǐnshí*), **starving and parched in agony** (*è nèi kě tòng*), though they **ever fret and lament** (*suī cháng yōu ào*).\n\nIn every realm, **all such hungry ghosts** (*rúshì èguǐ dào zhōng yīqiè èguǐ*)—if they hear this **natural fragrance** (*zìrán xiāng*), and **awaken to the Dao** (*néng wò dàodào*), then the **flavor of the Way fills their being** (*dào wèi chōng fù*), and they **attain satiety** (*jí dé bǎo mǎn*), **dispelling hunger and thirst** (*xiāochú jī kě*), **unblocking throat and palate** (*kāi míng hóu yān*), and **forever free from torment** (*yǒng wú è nǎo*).\n\nFor **beastly paths** (*chùshēng dào*), **all transformations—wet, dry, sluggish, or lively** (*mǎo huà shī yǒu zhuó dòng*)—are included, not just **birds and beasts** (*bù zhuān yán qín shòu*). Though **beasts are nurtured and ridden** (*chùshēng zhě suī xùyǎng yú tiān dì zhī wèn*) and **lack wisdom** (*wú yǒu zhìhuì*), their **karmic retribution is manifold and bitter** (*yèbào duō kǔ suī kǔ nán tuō*). Yet if all **beasts in every realm** (*gè shìjiè yīqiè chùshēng*) hear this **natural wondrous fragrance** (*zìrán miào xiāng*), and **awaken to the Dao** (*jí néng wò dàodào*), they will **attain this liberation** (*dé cǐ jiětuō*), their **karmic retribution exhausted** (*yèbào jí jìn*), and **escape the suffering of beasts** (*tuōlí chùshēng zhī kǔ*), attaining instead the **joy of keen wisdom** (*dé cōngmíng zhìhuì zhī lè*).\n\nBeasts are **not without intelligence** (*chùshēng fēi wú zhì*), but they **cannot speak of the Dao** (*bù néng yán dàodào*), **cannot embody its truth** (*bù néng tǐ dàodào*), and their **forms differ, their spirits distinct** (*xíng yì shén shū*). Some are **domesticated and ridden** (*huàn yǎng chéng yù*), others **hunted and slaughtered** (*yúliè shā shí*), **falling into traps** (*tóu diàn jǐng*), **filled for the kitchen** (*chōng páochú*), **devoured raw and blood-drenched** (*rú máo yǐn xiě, pí gǔ suī jìn*), their **skins and bones consumed** (*zuì kǔ nán yán*). Hearing the fragrance, they **attain wisdom** (*jí dé zhìhuì*), all through the **Sovereign’s radiant law** (*dìguāng fǎlì yě*).\n\nThe **limited perspective** (*guǎn jiàn*) says: The **two preceding sections** (*shàng liǎng jié*) share a **single intent** (*jù yī yì*). The **original spirit** (*yuánshēn*) of the human body **oversees yin and yang** (*zǒng yù yīnyáng*), embodying the **true and wondrous conduct** (*zhēn shèng miào xíng*), the **divine consort and royal daughter** (*líng fēi wáng nǚ suī yǒu*). Within the **Great Harmony** (*tàihé*), the **spirit, qi, essence, and blood** (*shén qì jīng xuè*) all contain this **marvelous fragrance** (*jiētuō zìrán xiāng*), **liberating by nature** (*miào miào nán qióng yě*), **subtle and boundless** (*wēimiào nán qióng yě*).\n\nWhen **qi is imbalanced** (*qì zhī piānzhèng*), it is **not from inherent madness or folly** (*fēi kuángyú shìfèn*), yet they too **fall into the Six Paths** (*yǒu liùdào*). Only when the **Heavenly Sovereign’s governance is unbalanced** (*tiān jūn bù tài*), are they **constrained by the Five Phases** (*wéi wǔxíng suǒ jū*); or when **thoughts are not severed** (*niàn tóu bù duàn*), **flitting and chaotic** (*fēnfēn rǎorǎo*), are they **controlled by yin and yang** (*wéi yīnyáng suǒ zhì*).\n\nThese too are **those who endure the Six Paths’ revolving torments** (*shì yě shòu liùdào lún zhuǎn zhě yě*). If one **beholds their own body’s beauty** (*dǔ jǐ shēn liùdīng yùnǚ zhī měi*), **hears the Great Harmony’s natural fragrance** (*wén tàihé jiětuō zìrán zhī xiāng*), and **comprehends the Great Way** (*míng chè dàdào*), then their **original spirit remains ever resplendent** (*shǐ yuánshēn cháng huàn*), and they **behold the Sovereign’s radiance** (*jí shǐ dǐguāng ér xiān huà*), **transcending dust and mundanity** (*yǒng tuō chén fán, bù wéi shēn jū*), and thus **forever freed from the Six Paths’ suffering** (*shì yě yǒng tuō liùdào zhī kǔ yě*).\n\nThose who **attain** (*dá*) will **taste its meaning** (*zhī wèi yǎn*), **recognizing the two sections’ intent** (*zì shí liǎng jié zhī yì*).\n\n**The Twelve Chapters on Spiritual Penetration** (*Shéntōng pǐn shí'èr zhāng*)\nAt that time, **all the assembled beings of Heavenly Retribution** (*zhūshìng tiānzuì zhūhún*), having **obtained rebirth in this Victorious Heavenly Palace** (*yuán dé shēng shì shèng tiān gōng yě*), **owing to their reception of the Compassionate Light** (*yuán dé chéng cíguāng shè shòu zhī gǔ*), **immediately awaken** (*biàn dé jiào wò*), **each clearly understanding the causes of guilt and blessing** (*gè gè míng liǎo zuìfú yīnyuán*), and **with their attendants** (*yǔ zhū quànshǔ*), they **perform celestial arts and music** (*zuò tiān jì yīn jì*), **their devotion fervent** (*qí yī qiè*). **伎** (*jì*) means **art** (*art*). Some texts read **伎** (*jì*) as **乐** (*yìng lè*).\nThe **倚切** (*yī qiè*) and **渠纪切** (*qú jì qiè*) pronunciations align with **与** (*yǔ*), so **伎** (*jì*) should follow the **乐** (*lè*) meaning.\nThey **rejoice and come before the Sovereign** (*lè lái yì dì qián*).\n\n「This is when all the guilty beings, each filled with sorrow, simultaneously raised their voices to speak: *\"Your servants have traversed countless kalpas—both great and small—without ever seeing the Three Lights of sun, moon, and stars. We have always dwelled in the depths of darkness, plunged into the Three Evil Paths of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals, enduring endless suffering and torment.\"*\n\nNow, as we have received the **Emperor’s** (*Yuánshǐ Dì*) **compassionate illumination** (*cíguāng*), **divine grace** (*mìhuà*) has transformed us into **True Fragrance** (*zhēn xiāng*), and due to the **Emperor’s boundless virtue and luminous compassion** (*Dàcí guāngmíng*) **that encompasses and guides us** (*shè shòu zhī gǔ*), we have all **awakened to the Great Dao** (*Dàdào*), **each now comprehending the profound causes of guilt and blessing** (*zuìfú yīnyuán*).\n\n**Encompass** (*shè*), here, means **to receive, guide, and uphold** (*jiēyǐn bǎochí*). **Guide** (*shòu*), here, means **to summon the soul and spirit** (*jiēyǐn húnshén*), **inviting them to return to their true nature** (*chào zhī guīzhēn*). When the **Emperor releases His compassionate light** (*cíguāng*), it **miraculously manifests as True Fragrance** (*zhēn xiāng*), **encompassing and guiding all guilty beings** (*zuìzhòng*), who **immediately awaken** (*jiào*), **grasping their true nature** (*zhī qí suǒyǐrán*), and **penetratingly understand** (*chè tōng*).\n\nThe guilty beings, having **awakened and comprehended**, **escape the Three Evil Paths** (*sǔn qí sān èdào qù*), **each now clearly and thoroughly understanding** (*gè gè míng tōng liǎo chè*), **deeply knowing the causes of guilt and blessing** (*zuìfú yīnyuán*). **Cause** (*yīn*) refers to **root** (*fēnggēn*), meaning that **where there is cause, there is effect** (*yǒu yīn zé yǒu guǒ*). **Connection** (*yuán*) refers to **proximity** (*yóulái*), meaning that **where there is connection, there is karma** (*yǒu yuán zé yǒu yè*). Once the guilty beings **clearly understand the causes and effects of their guilt and virtue** (*zuìyè fúdé yīnguǒ yuángù*), along with their **kindred and companions** (*qīnchūn zhùshǔ*), they **perform celestial arts and wondrous music** (*tiān jì miàolè*) before the **Emperor’s throne** (*yì Dì qián*).\n\n**Celestial arts** (*tiān jì*), when **interpreted through the term \"art\"** (*yì*), signifies **their perfection and boundless mastery** (*qiánwéi bùtōng*). **To come before** (*lái yì*), here, means **to arrive** (*zhì*). These are the guilty beings who have been **reborn in heaven**, each now **filled with sorrow** (*bāohán zhuó*), as they **utter their voices in lamentation** (*jù fā shēngyán*): *\"Your servants, through countless kalpas past and present, have never seen the Three Lights—sun, moon, and stars—always dwelling in the gloom of darkness, fallen into the Three Evil Paths of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals, enduring much suffering and anguish.\"*\n\n**To bow humbly** (*fú*), here, means **to prostrate oneself on the ground** (*jūshēn fǔfú dìxià*). **To receive** (*méng*), here, means **to accept from above and below** (*yǎngshòu yǐngbèi*). The phrase *\"as we have received\"* (*fú méng*) is used **to express lowly submission to the exalted** (*wēicéng yǐngzūn*), and should be understood as such. Later, when the text says *\"received\"* (*méng*), it follows this same convention.\n\nThe **Emperor’s compassionate light** (*cíguāng*) **permeates all with boundless wisdom** (*pùxíng dàomìàorén dé biànyì*), **allowing us to benefit greatly** (*dé biànyì*). Once this **compassionate light is released** (*fàng*), **He takes pity and rescues us** (*liánmǐn jiùbá wǒdéng*), **enabling all to be reborn in heaven** (*jiēdé shēng yú tiānshàng*). These **evil deeds and their suffering karmic retributions** (*èkǔ yèbào*) are **all eradicated and exhausted** (*xījiē chúmiè liǎojìn*), **with no lingering bonds or hindrances** (*wú zhōngxì hùliǎn*), and **all attain rebirth in the heavens** (*jiēdé wǎngshēng zhūtiān*), **paying homage to the Jade Sovereign Emperor** (*yǎngcháo Yùhuáng Dìshàng*), **each arriving at the Dao’s boundless origin** (*gè gè zhì Dàodào qiánmiàn*).\n\nWhen the **reborn heavenly beings and all guilty ones** (*shēngtiān zuìzhòng*) **finish speaking these words**, they **prostrate themselves and return to their original positions** (*qǐshǒu fùguī yuánshì lì*).\n\n**The Fool’s Reflection** (*Yú’àn*): **\"Humans are born with yin and yang** (*rén bǐng yīnyáng*), **inherently the same as heaven and earth** (*yǔ tiāndì běnlái xiāngtóng*). Yet, **ensnared by desires and greed** (*nì yú lìyù*), they **defile and sink their true hearts** (*wū xiàn zhēnxīn*), **persisting in evil without repentance** (*cháng è bù quān*), and **consider the wheel of retribution** (*bàoyìng zhuánlún*) as nonexistent—**this is ignorance of the causes of guilt and blessing** (*bùzhī zuìfú yīnyuán*). Thus, **the harmony of the Dao is lost** (*miào hé zhēnyì wúyǒu*), and they are **ensnared by the mundane constraints** (*bì yú chénsú zhī gāng*), **clinging to lust, anger, delusion, and jealousy** (*tānchīn chǐmìng*), **lost in madness, sorrow, and fleeting joy** (*kuángluàn bēixǐ*), **obsessed with desires and seeking fame** (*shìyù qiúmíng*), **never realizing the true path** (*bùjiàn liǎoqī*). This is why they **always dwell in darkness** (*chángchǔ hēi’àn*), **like the beings of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals** (*rú dìyù èguǐ chùshēng zhī zài sān èdào zhōng*), **enduring torment day and night** (*zhòuyè áojiān*), **just as the guilty beings suffer greatly** (*yì yú zhūzuìzhòng duōshòu kǔnǎo yībān*).\n\nThis is the **state of those whose evil deeds are not exhausted** (*èyè bùjìn*), **bound by lingering karmic ties** (*yǒu xì hù bùdé shēngtiān*), **who cannot be reborn in heaven** (*zhī zuìzhòng*).

Thus, when their lives ended, their bodies **fell into the Three Realms of Suffering** (*sān tú*, i.e., **Hell, Hungry Ghosts, and Beasts** (*dìyù, èguǐ, chùshēng*)), unable to **attain liberation** (*bùdé jiětuō*).\n\n**Had it not been for today**, when they **encountered this wondrous Dharma assembly** (*yù shì fǎ yàn*), how could they **escape the cycle of suffering** (*hé yóu chūlí*)?\n\nThe **Great Sovereign of the Purple Micro** (*Zǐwēi Dàdì*) declared: **\"When the Radiant Light of Great Compassion was being received**, the Jade Sovereign emitted this Great Mysterious Sound.

Hence, it is called the **Mysterious Sound** (*Miàoyīn*). The Jade Sovereign instructed the **sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions** (*shí fāng gè shìjiè zhū tiān dì shèngzhēn shénzhòng*):\n\n**\"You all must listen closely** (*Rú qí dì tīng*). **You**, here—**listen with utmost clarity and sincerity** (*dì*, **详审真听** *xiáng shèn zhēn tīng*).

The **Six Dusts** (*liù chén*) are the **six impure sense faculties** (*yǎn, ěr, bí, shé, shēn, yì liù gēn bù jìng*)—**eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind** (*wèi zhī liù chén*). Some say the **Six Dusts** are **wealth, beauty, fame, food, sleep, and private desires** (*cái, sè, míng, shí, shuì, zìbiàn sīxīn*), which is also acceptable.\n\n**Within and without the body**, all were **defiled by dust** (*jiē shòu chén wū*), **not a single spot remaining pure** (*wú xiē qīngjìng*), hence the phrase **\"pervasively stained\"** (*biàn rǎn*).\n\nThey were **ensnared by the Three Poisons** (*sān yè yíng chán*). The **Three Poisons** (*sān yè*) are the **three defiling deeds of body, speech, and mind** (*shēn, kǒu, xīn zhī sān dú èyè*). Some say the **Three Poisons** are **past karmic deeds, present transgressions, and future karmic accumulation** (*wǎng yīn sùyè, jiànzài qiān yè, wèilái chōng yè*), which is also acceptable.\n\n**Ensnared** (*yíng chán*) means **twisting and binding** (*xuán, fàn zhī yì*). Their **accumulated deeds weighed heavily** (*jī yè zhòng lèi*), like **ropes binding a person**, preventing them from **freeing themselves** (*bùdé tuōshēn*), hence **\"ensnared\"** (*yíng chán*).\n\nThey **indulged their thoughts without restraint** (*sì fàng yìsī*), **unable to curb themselves**, **following their own desires**, **never reflecting or repenting**, **committing hidden sins** (*yōuyín guò'è zhī yīn zuì*)—**known only to themselves** (*rén bù jiànwén, zìjǐ dú zhī*)—and **manifest transgressions** (*yáng guò*)—**visible to all** (*zhòng suǒ wénjiàn, bùnéng yǎnshì*), **errors uncorrected** (*cuòwù bù gǎi*).\n\nDay by day, month by month, their **evil deeds deepened** (*rìrì jiànjī, yuèyuè yì shēn*), as they **abandoned the Dao and defied the True** (*bèidào wéizhēn*), **yielding to false paths and forsaking Rectitude** (*shùn xiétú, qì zhèngdào*).

Thus, **obscured by ignorance, one becomes ordinary** (*zhē yǐn wéi fán*), **while awakening reveals the sacred** (*liǎo wù wéi shèng*).\n\n**The distinction between the ordinary and the sacred hinges on a hair’s breadth** (*shèng kuáng zhī fèn, jiàn bù róng fā*). **If humans can curb their desires and return to their true nature** (*rén néng shèqíng guīxìng*), **settle their fate with divine spirit** (*mìngdìng shénlíng*), **grasp the subtle balance of reason and desire** (*dá lǐ yù zhī jǐ*), and **know the self-origin of dusty evil** (*zhī chén'è zhī zì*), they **suddenly free themselves from suffering** (*dùn tuō yèkǔ*), **harmonize in silence with the Mysterious and Profound** (*mòqì zhòng xuán*), and thus **the Jade Sovereign’s Mysterious Sound instructs the Ten Directions** (*yù shì fǎ yàn*), **those burdened by ignorance’s nature** (*zòngxìng zào'è*), **encountering the Dharma assembly** (*yù fǎ huì yàn*) and **escaping the Three Evil Paths** (*chūlí sān èdào*).\n\n**If one regards the nature of ignorance as a burden** (*rú yǐ wú míngxìng wéi lèi*), **seeking the True while separating from it** (*lí cǐ qiú zhēn*), **this is to divide into two paths** (*shì fèn èr tú*), **and thus one cannot attain the Mysterious and Profound in unity** (*bùdé huì yī dá miào*).\n\n**Students must ponder this deeply** (*xuézhě wán zhī, zì zhī chāofán zhī yào*).\n\n---\n\n**The Fourteenth Chapter on Divine Pervasiveness** (*Shéntōng pǐn shísì zhāng*): At that time, the **sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions**, transformed by the **Jade Sovereign’s divine form** (*zhū tiān huàshēn Yùdì*), **without moving from their places** (*bùdòng qí suǒ*), **transported and united the celestial and human** (*yí jiē tiān rén*), **all arriving beneath the assembly of the Original Beginning** (*jiē lìng dé zhì Qīngwēi Tiāngōng, zuìshàng Yùqīng shèngjìng, Yuánshǐ Dàozǔ huì xià*).\n\n**These multitudes were unaware** (*zhè zhū zhòng děng, bùjué bùzhī*). At that moment, the **Heavenly Sovereign and the assembled multitudes** (*tiān zūn jí huì zhòng děng*), **seeing the Jade Sovereign’s divine form** (*jiàn shì shí fāng Yùdì huàshēn*), **all gathered before the Heavenly Sovereign** (*pǔ jiē lái jí Tiānzūn huì qián*), **like a boundless mirror of light** (*rú wúbiān míngjìng*), **reflecting all images** (*zhào zhū yǐngxiàng*), **mutually interpenetrating**.\n\nAt that time, the **great multitudes** (*shí zhū dàzhòng*), **prostrating and gazing in awe** (*qǐshǒu zhān yǎng Yùdì huàshēn*), **the most sacred and exalted among the sacred** (*shèngzhōng zuì zūn*), **increased their pure faith** (*zhǎngzhǎng qīngxìn*), **deepening their joyful resolve** (*yì jiā zhìlè*). Their **hearts were steadfast, without retreat** (*xīn wú tuì zhuǎn*), **rising with great firmness** (*qǐ dà jiāngù*).\n\nThe **Heavenly Sovereign, the Great Emperor** (*Tiānhuáng Dàdì*) proclaimed: **\"When the Radiant Light of Great Compassion was being received**, the **divine forms of the various Heavenly Palaces** (*gè dà tiāngōng huàshēn zhī Yùdì*), **the Jade Sovereigns**, **employed their Great Divine Pervasiveness** (*jí yǐ dà shéntōng*), **majestic and unmoving** (*wēiwēi bùdòng*). **Their divine light, wondrous and transformative**, **transported and united the celestial and human** (*shè qí suǒ shén guāng miào yí jiē zhū tiān zhū rén*), **all arriving beneath the Heavenly Sovereign’s assembly** (*jiē lìng dé zhì Qīngwēi Tiāngōng, zuìshàng Yùqīng shèngjìng, Yuánshǐ Dàozǔ huì xià*).\n\nThe **Yùqīng** is the most exalted and unparalleled realm—**the Great Pure, Quiet, and Secret Heaven**. The **Sacred [□] Realm** is where the **Ultimate Truth** reigns, where **emptiness and wondrous manifestation** coalesce; even the gods find it difficult to reach. It is the **land of no retreat**.\n\nBeneath the **Primordial Origin Assembly**, only the **Great Sage** and those of **auspicious karmic connection** may **pay homage and gaze upon** the Sovereign. When the **sutra was being expounded**, all celestial and human beings gathered, and through the **Jade Sovereign’s divine transformation and compassionate guidance**, they were **transported and united** to arrive here.\n\nThus, these celestial and human assemblies **unwittingly and without knowing how**, found themselves beneath the **Primordial Origin Assembly**. At that time, the **Celestial Sovereign** was none other than the **Primordial Origin Celestial Sovereign**. Some may assume these were the **various Heavenly Emperors**, but this is incorrect. At that moment, the **Primordial Origin** and the gathered assembly **witnessed all the Jade Sovereigns’ transformed bodies from the Ten Directions**, **universally assembled** before the **Grand Primordial Assembly**, **displayed without obstruction**, like an **infinite, boundless mirror of radiant light**, illuminating all forms and shadows, **mutually containing and embracing without hindrance**, **encompassing none in exclusion**.\n\nAt that time, the **Great Assembly** prostrated themselves fully, **bowing their heads to the ground**, gazing upward in reverence at the **Jade Sovereign’s divine transformation**—the **most exalted and sacred of all**. The Jade Sovereign is the **Sage Teacher of all Buddhas**, the **Lord of Ten Thousand Heavens**, hence the **most exalted**. This **augments pure, sincere faith**, **deepens resolute aspiration and joy**, **reaffirms commitment to the Dao and returns to the True**, **unwavering in resolve before it can be called sincere**, **truly rejoicing in the Great Dao before it can be called devotion**.\n\nThe assembly **beheld the Jade Sovereign’s wondrous transformation**, their hearts **delighted and sincerely submissive**, hence the **increased aspiration and joy**, their **whole hearts devoted in reliance**. There was **no thought of retreat, destruction, or deviation**; they **arose with the greatest firmness and unwavering sincerity**. A **retreating heart is not firm**; a **wandering heart is not steadfast**. Without firmness and steadfastness, there is **no pure faith, no resolute joy**. Only by **gazing upon the Jade Sovereign with no thought of retreat** does one **awaken the greatest unchanging, indestructible true resolve**, **eternally devoted to the Great Dao**.\n\n**In my humble observation**: Human **qi and spirit** share the same source, yet their transformations differ. If the **heart does not align with the Dao**, even through **guiding and directing**, it remains **not the true path**. Thus, the **spirit does not condense**, the **numinous does not manifest**, and **mysterious transformations cannot emerge**.\n\nIf the **Primordial Spirit condenses into Truth**, **wondrously encompassing all existence**, allowing one to **silently pay homage to the True Emperor**, to **meet in the Mysterious Palace of the Spirit**, **True Suchness unfettered**, **requiring no contrivance**, then the **Jade Sovereign’s divine transformations**—the **Great Divine Pervasiveness**—**unmoving, guiding and uniting the celestial and human**, arrive at the **Primordial Origin’s Pure and Secret Assembly**.\n\nWhen **qi and essence converge in mystical union**, **silently conforming to the Imperial Will**, **unaware and unknowing**, the **Primordial Spirit moves the numinous**, **illuminating all wondrous manifestations**, **without restriction or leakage**, then the **Great Assembly, unaware, ascends to the upper realms**. The **Primordial Origin** and the assembly **behold the Sovereign’s transformed bodies**, all gathered like **a great radiant mirror**, their lights **brilliantly illuminating**, their forms **mutually contained without obstruction**.\n\nWhen **qi and essence merge with the spirit**, **uniting in secret to return to the True**, **without defilement or deceit**, **joyfully at ease**, **once obtained, eternally retained**, **never destroyed or lost**, then the **Great Assembly gazes upon the Jade Sovereign’s transformed body**, **knowing its most exalted nature**, **augments pure faith**, **deepens resolute joy**, **has no thought of retreat**, and **arises with the greatest firmness**.\n\n**Students who deeply embody this** will **see its marvels**.\n\nIn the **Chapter on Divine Pervasiveness (Shéntōng)**, the **celestial and human beings** who drew near **suddenly attained heavenly birth**, **glimpsing the Celestial Sovereign’s supreme assembly**, the **Dao’s pure and first realm**, **adorned by the merit of non-action**, **leaping with joy**, they **paid homage in reverence**, exclaiming, **\"Never before have we witnessed such a wondrous assembly!\"**\n\nAt that time, the **Jade Sovereigns’ transformed bodies from the Ten Directions** **all returned to their singular form**, seated upon the **Law Seat**. The **pure assembly** at the **Law Feast** all wished to **hear the Jade Sovereign’s original conduct and realization**, yet **dared not ask**.\n\nZhang Guo remarked: **\"When the Jade Sovereign’s transformed bodies universally gathered**, the **celestial and human beings** who drew near **received the Sovereign’s compassionate light**, their **spirits ascending to the Supreme Mysterious**, **attaining birth in the Pure and Secret Heaven**. Suddenly, they **beheld the Great Celestial Sovereign**, the **most supreme and auspicious assembly**, the **greatly beneficial Dao’s assembly**.\n\nAn **assembly** is merely where **common folk gather**; if the **benefits of the assembly are limited**, it cannot be called a **supreme assembly**. When the **Primordial Origin expounded the Jade Scripture**, the **Jade Sovereign displayed compassionate light**, and **all beings from the various Dharma Realms universally gathered**, **gods, ghosts, and mortals eternally benefiting from great advantage**. This **opened the great destiny of the Three Teachings**, **proclaimed the profound essence of Ten Thousand Laws**. It was the **most excellent and supreme Law Feast**. Across countless kalpas, no assembly could compare—**its merit was supreme, never to be destroyed or lost**, hence the **supreme assembly**.\n\nAt the assembly, the **Primordial Origin praised the Jade Sovereign’s virtue**, **transmitted the Law of Ultimate Truth**, the **supreme single vehicle**, **universally liberating all beings to awakening**, hence the **Dao’s assembly**. This **supreme assembly** was **utterly free of defilement**, **pure, subtle, and wondrously clear**—the **first and foremost in purity**. The **Jade Sovereign’s marvelous transformation** emerged **naturally**, **universally saving and eternally benefiting** through **profound, effortless function**. The **Sand Realm** was **enlightened by grace**, **eternally bathed in blessings across kalpas**.\n\nThe **Jade Sovereign never had intent**; the **Primordial Origin never took action**. The **Ten Thousand Heavens yielded their merit**; the **Buddhas relinquished their virtue**. Through **auspicious karmic connection and wondrous assembly**, the **transformative function shone universally**, **adorned by the merit of True Non-Action**. The **celestial and human**, witnessing this, **rejoiced beyond measure**, **truly unaware of dancing with hands or stamping with feet**, yet **leaping with joy**.\n\nAt that moment, the **Great Assembly prostrated themselves fully**, **paid homage**, declaring, **\"Throughout countless kalpas, we have never witnessed such a wondrous supreme assembly!\"**\n\nAt that time, the **Jade Sovereigns’ transformed bodies from the Ten Directions** **all returned to their singular form**, seated upon the **Great Radiant Law Seat**. The **pure assembly** at the **Law Feast**—those **riding the Sovereign’s light**, **ascending while ancient dust vanished**, **utterly free of defilement**—**witnessed the Jade Sovereign’s transformed body displayed across all great heavenly palaces and worlds**, **all illuminated by radiant light**.\n\nAt this moment, before the **Primordial Sovereign’s Assembly**, the **Jade Sovereigns** once more **assumed their singular form**, neither lacking in their divided transformations nor excessive in their unity—**suddenly dividing, suddenly gathering**, their divine mysteries **unfathomable**, their origins **unknown**.\n\nWith such **divine powers**, the **Fourfold Assembly** contemplated this and **all wished to hear** the **Jade Sovereign’s fundamental practice and cultivation**, the **path to attaining sainthood**—yet **none dared to presume and ask**.\n\n**The humble scholar reflects:** Within a single human body, **qi** and **spirit** circulate and guard, **meridians and sinews** interweave and connect, **exterior and interior** mutually depend, **void and subtle** respond with marvelous efficacy, **movement and stillness** sustain each other. **One origin divides into myriad forms**, while **myriad forms return to one source**.\n\nYet **humans, bound by materiality and obscured by greed**, indulge in **delusive desires and false imaginings**, causing **clarity to dim** and **subtlety to stagnate**. Occasionally, **those who study the Dao to benefit the world** may **exhibit petty wisdom and private virtue**, **feigning merit and grace**—their kindness and benevolence **limited in extent**, how could they **truly embody the Dao**?\n\nIf one **begins well but ends poorly**, **commences virtuously yet fails to complete**, or **forcibly contrives divisions and handles**, though **seeming enlightened**, they **do not grasp the Dao’s profundity**. Those who **truly comprehend and awaken**, whose **illumination is universal and pure**, whose **stillness and response are both steadfast**—they **neither welcome nor reject with disturbance**; their **spirit flows naturally, silent and in accord**, without **laboring to push and turn**.\n\nWhen the **Dao’s subtle mechanisms are preserved**, and **human hearts retreat to listen**, **turbulence clarifies**, **obstruction dissolves**, **true self-awakening is attained**, **joy arises effortlessly**, **free from bonds and veils**, **ever-renewing in wonder**—then **all heavenly beings and humans** are born into **heavenly realms**, **beholding the Celestial Worthy’s Assembly**, **pure and transcendent**, **effortless virtue manifesting in splendor**, and **leaping with delight to pay homage**, declaring, **\"Never before have we seen this!\"**\n\n**Gathering myriad into one**, the **Celestial Sovereign ascends the throne**, and **thus the Jade Sovereigns of the Ten Directions return to their singular form**, seated upon the **Law Seat**.\n\nIf the **pure assembly** wishes to hear of the **Sovereign’s practice**, yet **none dare to question presumptuously**, then the **Sutra’s origins and roots** are **naturally revealed**—**not to be spoken of as one’s own**.\n\nThose who **study the Dao** will **perceive its wonders** in secret.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Divine Powers**\n\nThus, the **Celestial Worthy** proclaimed to the **Fourfold Assembly**:\n\n**\"In the distant past, there was a realm** called **Light-Strict Mannerly Joy**. Its **king was named Pure Virtue** (*Jìngdé*).\n\nAt that time, the **king had a queen**, named **Treasure Moonlight**. The **king had no heir**, and one day, he **pondered thus**: *‘I may speak as “the Sovereign” (帝, *dì*), or as “I” (朕, *zhèn*). This is the king’s own speech. It cannot be “the Sovereign.” In past kalpas, I have never spoken as “I.” It must be “我” (I, *wǒ*). Now as I grow old, yet **no crown prince exists**. If my body **should perish or collapse**—*‘崩’* (*bēng*) means death, as when a mountain **shatters in great upheaval**—**to whom will the ancestral temples and the realm be entrusted?** The **temple of the soil god** (*shè*) and the **temple of the grain god** (*jì*)—**the state depends on its people**, and **people depend on the land and grain for sustenance**. The **soil and grain deities** are **of utmost importance**, hence when a king **rules the land**, he **must speak of the ancestral temples and the realm**.\n\n**Every realm has a great ancestral temple** (*tàimìao*), where the **first ancestor**, the **second ancestor** (who transmits the direct lineage), the **third ancestor**, the **fourth ancestor**, the **great-great-grandfather**, the **highest ancestor**, the **great-grandfather**, and the **grandfather** are enshrined. The **first ancestor** stands in the center, with the **left ancestral halls** (*Zhāo*) and the **right ancestral halls** (*Mù*) arranged on either side, totaling **nine ancestral temples**. **Humans cherish their descendants**; how much more so a **king who rules the land**—**their fate is vastly different**.\n\nThus, the **king worried**: *‘If I have no heir, to whom will the ancestral temples be entrusted?’* After **such contemplation**, he **immediately issued an edict**, commanding the **Daoist assemblies and pure ones** in all **palaces and temples** to **follow the Dao’s teachings**, **recite the scriptures of expiation**, **hang the sacred banners and jewels**, **maintain purity and solemnity**, and **abundantly prepare offerings**. At **each of the six periods of the day**, they **burn incense and chant the Dao**, **visiting every temple**, praying to the **immortal sages and celestial worthies**. After **half a year**, the **king’s devotion grew yet more sincere**, **never wavering from his original resolve** to establish the **Dao Assembly** and pray for expiation.\n\n**The humble scholar reflects:** **Human life** in this body **inherits the principles of Heaven and Earth**, **takes form from Heaven and Earth’s qi**, and **receives the essence of father and mother**. Thus, **this physical existence** is **endowed with vitality**. It **receives the luminous influence of sun and moon** as **clarity**, **depends on the king’s water and land** for **sustenance**, **follows the sage’s institutions** for **order and protection**, and **learns from enlightened teachers and friends** for **advancement and growth**.\n\nWith **the Dao**, one **stands in harmony with Heaven and Earth**, **nurtures all beings**, **enters sainthood and transcends mortality**, **free from the bonds of life and death**. Without **the Dao**, all **endeavors crumble**, **one’s name fades into obscurity**, **karma accumulates in error**, and **retribution never ceases**. **Ascending to sainthood**, one’s **body perishes yet essence remains**, **dwelling with the Dao eternally**—**even descendants continue**, **sacrifices never halt**. **As a mortal**, one **has no progeny**, **cutting off ancestral rites**.\n\nThe **difference between sainthood and mortality** is **so stark**.\"\n\nThe threshold between sainthood and mortality—how vast is the divide?\n\nIf one knows the weight of this body’s bonds, that life and death are fleeting yet grave, and does not squander this form, if one recognizes the fourfold debts of gratitude and the gravity of the five constants, if one fulfills one’s duties, clarifies the myriad things, cultivates with reverence, advances in learning to know, and remains steadfast and resolute—heeding virtue and acting upon it without delay—if one examines oneself day and night, preserving integrity from start to finish, unashamed even before the scrutiny of heaven, and never faltering in sincerity, then one aligns with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with the sun and moon in luminosity, with the four seasons in order, and with spirits in fortune and misfortune. Thus, one awaits sainthood without doubt, never slacking for an instant, living in harmony and dying in peace, returning to the primordial transformation, leaving behind a legacy that grows ever brighter—even as the Light-Strong King’s Confession, whose devotion never wavered.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Divine Manifestations**\n\nSuddenly, in a single night, the Queen of Precious Moonlight dreamed of the Most High Dao Lord and the assembled Perfect Ones, their forms radiant as gold, their voices pure as jade, their essence untainted and luminous. They rode upon a five-colored dragon carriage, surrounded by banners of dazzling splendor, their seals and flags casting protective shadows. A canopy of resplendent clouds enveloped them.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Dao Lord sat serenely upon the dragon carriage, cradling an infant. The child’s every pore emitted a hundred billion rays of light, illuminating the royal palaces in hues of priceless treasures, with banners and flags leading the way as they floated through the void.\n\nSeeing this, the Queen’s heart filled with joy. She knelt in reverence before the Dao Lord and humbly petitioned: *\"My lord, the king has no heir. I pray you grant this child to be the sovereign of our realm. May your boundless compassion hear my plea and bestow this child upon me.\"*\n\nThe Dao Lord replied: *\"I grant this child to you.\"*\n\nThe Queen bowed in gratitude and took the child. Upon waking, she found herself with child. After a year, on the ninth day of the first month in the Year of the Fire Horse, at noon, a son was born in the royal palace.\n\nThe Venerable Lord Guangsheng declared: *\"The Light-Strong King’s prayer for an heir was answered—his resolve never faltered.\"*\n\n---\n\nSuddenly, in one night, the Queen of Precious Moonlight dreamed of the Most High Lord of Supreme Treasure Dao and the assembled Perfect Saints, their forms gleaming with golden radiance, their bodies smooth as jade, their divine light pure and unblemished. They rode upon a five-colored dragon-borne palanquin, attended by banners of radiant splendor and flags of dazzling glory, their seals casting protective shadows beneath a canopy of luminous cloud-mist.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Dao Lord sat composedly within the five-colored dragon carriage, holding a divine infant. From every pore of the child’s body, a hundred billion wondrous lights emanated, illuminating the royal halls in the splendor of a hundred treasures. Banners and flags led the way, floating through the void.\n\nSeeing the Dao Lord holding the divine child, the Queen’s heart filled with delight. She knelt in reverence and respectfully addressed the Dao Lord: *\"My lord, the king has no heir. I humbly beseech you to grant this holy child as the sovereign of our land. May your great compassion pity the king’s childlessness and grant my request, bestowing this child upon me.\"*\n\nThe Dao Lord answered the Queen: *\"I specially grant this child to you.\"*\n\nThe Queen then paid her respects and thanked the Dao Lord before receiving the child. Upon waking from the dream, she found herself with child. After a year of pregnancy, on the ninth day of the first month in the Year of the Fire Horse, at noon, a son was born in the palace of the Light-Strong King of Wondrous Joy.\n\n**A Note from the Unworthy:**\nMankind’s birth is endowed with essence and form, with the principles of duty and life. The body bears the weight of the cosmic order, and life carries the dual responsibility of heaven and earth. Noble and luminous, it is both spiritually enlightened and free. Yet the body is not mere flesh, nor is life a trivial matter.\n\nBy nature, one is of golden essence and jade-like form, pure and unstained. But if one remains in darkness, indulges in delusion, and scorns this precious gift, unable to grasp the divine mystery, to nurture the sacred embryo, then one squanders the family’s most precious treasure—this very body—rendering it useless. Even if one has some self-regard, if one does not comprehend the Dao, if one’s practice is insincere, feigning virtue while indulging in vice, then though one may appear golden without, one is but rotting rags within.\n\nThus, one’s very self cannot be preserved, and though endowed with noble heavenly rank, one’s virtues remain unmanifest. How then can one fulfill one’s form and perfect one’s nature, ensuring that this true master does not decline?\n\nIf one awakens to the profound roots of life and death, aligns with the secrets of heaven and man, penetrates the mysteries of yin and yang, and delves deeply into the workings of creation—if one recognizes one’s ancestral roots, acknowledges one’s parents, sees that which gave birth to one rooted in the receptive, and understands that which nurtured one rooted in the creative—if one refines the golden essence, purifies the jade-like form, attains wonder in the boundless, and comprehends the mysterious in the void, then with the spirit of emptiness one may conceive the truth of marvelous existence, forming a sacred embryo and giving birth to a saintly child. Thus, those who gave birth to one do not labor in vain, and those who nurtured one are not forgotten. With bones of gold and flesh of jade, one transcends form and spirit, withering yet reborn, enduring without end—even as the Queen of Precious Moonlight dreamed of the Most High Dao Lord and the Pure Ones, receiving the holy child as the sovereign of the realm.\n\nMankind is one. Awakening brings divinity; ignorance brings ruin. To perceive the Queen of Precious Moonlight’s prayer for a child is to awaken to the Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Divine Manifestations**\n\nAt the time of his birth, his body radiated a dazzling light, filling the kingdom with its brilliance. His appearance was exquisite beyond measure, and all who beheld him found no satisfaction in gazing upon him.\n\nFrom infancy, he was quick-witted and wise; as he grew, he became compassionate and benevolent. Within his realm, he distributed all treasures and wealth from the royal stores, relieving the destitute, the widowed, the orphaned, the aged, the sick, the hungry, and all suffering beings.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Divine Manifestations**\n\nWith virtue, love, and humility, songs of the Dao resounded; his influence reached the distant lands, and all under heaven revered and followed him, submitting to the **Daoist** Prince of Virtue. The **Highest Dao Lord** rejoiced in his father’s descent.\n\nWhen the Jade Emperor was born, his body emitted a radiant light of precious treasures, illuminating the **Pure and Radiant Realm** of the Light-Strength Kingdom. His form and appearance were wondrously beautiful, and those who gazed upon him never tired of beholding him.\n\nIn his tender youth, he was keen and wise; as he matured, he became compassionate, merciful, and virtuous. Within his own kingdom, from the imperial treasuries and granaries, he freely dispersed all riches and wealth—whether in abundance or measure, without hesitation or stinginess—until all were exhausted, as if scattering them without restraint.\n\nYet if one were to hoard wealth for oneself, it would mean neglecting one’s sovereign, one’s kin, and one’s state. The Jade Emperor, born with divine knowledge, was the **Most Exalted Sage** of perfect conduct—how could he commit such excess?\n\nThe imperial treasuries were not bestowed upon those who already possessed fortune. Instead, they went to the penniless and destitute, those trapped in despair or peril, the widowed husband, the widow, the orphaned child, the childless elder, those without mother or father to lean upon, and in years of famine when grain was scarce or vegetables unripe. To those afflicted with illness, decay, injury, or deformity—all beings in hardship—he granted relief and aid, his virtue flowing from the sincerest depths, not merely as outward show.\n\nWith boundless kindness and compassion, gentle and modest, his blessings extended across the land, his virtue praised in song. From the borderlands to the distant wilderness, his influence spread, and all under heaven looked to him in reverence, submitting to the **Daoist** Prince of Virtue.\n\n*\"Submit\"* means to join with him. The *Analects* says: *\"If one day you practice self-restraint and return to the Dao, all under heaven will submit to virtue.\"* Indeed, seeking the Dao brings swift attainment, and its effects are vast.\n\nThe Jade Emperor was born with divine marvels, and as he grew, his boundless compassion and virtue made all under heaven submit to him. His father rejoiced all the more.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Divine Manifestations**\n\nLater, the king suddenly passed away. The **Daoist** Prince, now ruler, cast his gaze upon the transient nature of life—*\"floating life\"*, for human existence is like a cloud in the sky or a floating leaf on water, fleeting and unable to endure. He issued decrees to his ministers, declaring that the throne should be passed to one who followed the Dao.\n\nThus, he abandoned his kingdom and retreated to the **Universal Clarity Fragrant Mountain** to cultivate the **Great Dao**. His merit was fulfilled, and he transcended the mundane world, ascending to the heavens.\n\nThe **Fighting Mother** said: When the **Daoist** Prince of Virtue ruled the **Wondrous Joy Kingdom**, and all under heaven submitted to virtue, the king suddenly died.\n\nThe **Daoist** Prince took the throne, governing the affairs of his kingdom. He cast his gaze upon the transient nature of life—*\"floating life\"*, for human existence is like a cloud in the sky or a floating leaf on water, fleeting and unable to endure. Having reflected thus, he commanded his ministers, declaring that the imperial treasure should be passed to one who followed the Dao and practiced goodness.\n\nOr it may be said: He entrusted the throne to his ministers, who were to inherit it by following the Dao and doing good. The intent remains the same.\n\nHaving entrusted the throne to the virtuous, he abandoned his kingdom and concealed himself within the **Universal Clarity Fragrant Mountain**, cultivating the **Great Dao**. The **Universal Clarity Fragrant Mountain**, according to ancient records, is the **Stonehead Mountain** of the Eastern Sea. The other mountains where the Jade Emperor left traces and expounded teachings are not the same as this Fragrant Mountain.\n\nOnce the **Daoist** Prince entered the mountain to cultivate, his merit was fulfilled, and he transcended the mundane world, ascending to the heavens.\n\n---\n\nThe **Daoist** Prince, though born as a mortal, possessed the **True Vital Qi** of life. With this **True Qi**, one may become human. This **True Qi**, when in the heavens and earth, is the **Wondrous Principle**; when in the body, it is the **Boundless Virtue**.\n\nThe **True Qi** is profound and luminous, its light self-arising, illuminating past and present, encompassing all of **Dharma-Realm**. If one fully embodies this principle, one need not suffer hardship or peril, nor face the world’s revulsion. Yet if one abandons it in the heavens, neglects it in the body, and fails to preserve the **True Nature of Inherited Virtue**, one cannot nurture the **True Qi** to give birth to **Divine Transformation**, nor refine the **Mysterious Mechanism** to achieve **Spiritual Manifestation**. Instead, one remains obscured and dim, filled with resentment and jealousy, greedy for gain and fame, hoarding without end, unconcerned with **Daoist Morality**, unmoved by the suffering of the poor, arrogant and self-praised, inviting slander and defamation. This is to harm the **True Qi**, weaken the **Boundless Virtue**, and sink oneself into the realm of the common and ignorant, unable to attain sainthood.\n\nIf, however, one preserves the **Great Harmony**, concentrates the **Secret Intent**, and the **Sage Embryo** radiates **Precious Light**, the **Divine Infant** emits **Wondrous Scenery**, gradually unfolding **Profound Deities**, with **Spiritual Manifestation** unimpeded—if one regards **worldly power and advantage** as mud and **honors and glory** as dust, using one’s abundance to aid others’ lack, benefiting all beings and extending mercy universally, accepting the rise and fall of one’s fate without ceasing—then one’s **merit and virtue** are boundless. One’s **Great Virtue and Divine Transformation** endure forever, earning the name of **Daoist Sage**, and all of **Dharma-Realm** is bathed in compassion.\n\nThe gods rejoice, and mortals are pleased, offering service to the **Most Exalted Virtue**. Thus, the child of the heavens and earth appears in the world as a wondrous being, and even his parents are honored and delighted.\n\nThis is the divine marvel of the Jade Emperor’s birth.\n\nAs he grew, his compassion and virtue were boundless, and all under heaven submitted to him. His father rejoiced all the more.\n\n---\n\nHow rare it is to find those who honor noble birth, yet how common the plight of poverty! Moreover, men are but drunken in dreams, lost in delusion and unaware.\n\nThus, those who practice the **Dao** are scarcely heard of—how much rarer still to become an **Immortal**!\n\nYet if one awakens to the truth that life is but a transient sojourn, as fleeting as the mayfly, and breaks free from the dust of mundane concerns, earnestly seeking the **Supreme Mystery**, penetrating its depths with clarity and resolve—without seeking swift results, yet knowing that when the time comes, transformation will unfold naturally—then one’s path will bear the name of **Immortal**.\n\nThough ancestors may pass, their legacy endures through the **Most Exalted Sage’s** arrival in **Luó**, ensuring they are not forgotten.\n\nWas it not the **Wondrous Bliss Prince**, abandoning his royal station to cultivate the **Dao**, who attained transcendence and delivered others?\n\nAh! The human body is like **Kunlun Mountain**—when the **Old Yang** is exhausted, a single **Yang** is reborn, transcending all boundaries. Through secret cultivation of the **True Essence**, time brings **Immortal Transformation**. Even the faintest aspiration toward **Immortalhood** mirrors the **Emperor’s** path.\n\nThis must be savored deeply.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Divine Powers (Twenty Sections)**\n\nAfter this **kalpa** had passed, spanning eight hundred **kalpas**, he repeatedly abandoned his kingdom for the sake of all beings, severing familial bonds to study the **Dao**.\n\nFollowing these **kalpas**, he spent another eight hundred practicing medicinal alchemy to heal the sick, rescuing suffering beings and granting them peace.\n\nWhen this **kalpa** ended, he spent another eight hundred **kalpas** employing vast **skillful means**, unveiling the **Daoist Canons**, reciting **Sacred Scriptures**, and propagating the **True Teaching** to its fullest extent, displaying **Divine Virtue** and aiding both state and people—from the hidden to the manifest.\n\nAfter these **kalpas**, he endured another eight hundred, sacrificing his body and life without hesitation, enduring humiliation and insult, offering his own flesh and blood in **Patience and Tolerance**.\n\nThus, through **ascetic practice** spanning **three thousand two hundred kalpas**, he attained the rank of **Golden Immortal**, named **Pure and Natural Awakened Ruler of **Dharma****, teaching all **Bodhisattvas** the sudden enlightenment of the **Great Vehicle’s True Doctrine**, gradually entering the **Mysterious and Void Supreme Dao**.\n\nAfter further cultivation spanning **ten million kalpas**, he attained the rank of **Jade Emperor**.\n\nWhen these words were spoken, the **Pure Assembly** of **Dharma** in unison exclaimed in wonder, for such **Sagely Virtue** had never been heard before.\n\n**True Lord** spoke: *\"In the **Jade Emperor’s** early life, after ascending the royal throne to cultivate, once these **kalpas** had passed, he spent another eight hundred as a prince. Each time he assumed the throne, it was for the sake of guiding and transforming beings, severing all ties of kinship to study the **True Dao**.\"*\n\n**Kalpas** vary in scale—sixty years constitute a **Dust-Kalpa**, five hundred years a **Pure and Auspicious Assembly-Kalpa**, three thousand years a **Leap-Kalpa**; eighteen thousand years mark a **Small Kalpa**, while one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years define a **Wheel-Kalpa**. When these accumulate into myriad **kalpas**, they form a **Great Kalpa**.\n\nThough eight hundred **kalpas** may encompass both small and great, the emphasis lies in their enduring duration—roughly eight hundred **kalpas** in number.\n\nAfter severing attachments to study the **Dao**, he spent another eight hundred **kalpas** administering medicinal elixirs, healing ailments, and rescuing suffering beings, granting them prosperity and joy.\n\nWhen these **kalpas** concluded, he spent another eight hundred employing vast **skillful means**, unveiling the **Daoist Canon’s** sacred texts, reciting **Profound and Sacred Scriptures**, expanding the **True and Great Teaching**, and disseminating **Divine Scripture’s** virtues—assisting the state and saving the people, from the obscure to the luminous.\n\nSome say *\"from the hidden to the manifest\"*—from the **Dark Realm** to the **Bright World**, encompassing all beneath heaven and earth.\n\nThis meaning is also coherent.\n\nAfter these **kalpas**, he endured another eight hundred, sacrificing his life without regret, enduring humiliation and insult, offering his own flesh and blood—yet taking others’ wealth as if it were his own, for men’s gifts are like the sacrifice of blood and flesh.\n\nIn a past **kalpa**, the **Jade Emperor** endured humiliation, accepting others’ wealth even in dire poverty and suffering, when insults were heaped upon him. Though others could not bear such hardship, he felt no retreat or remorse—this was his **Sacrifice of Body and Life**, his **Patience and Tolerance**, his offering of **flesh and blood**.\n\nLosing one’s parents is a trial even the common man finds unbearable, yet this was necessary to achieve what others could not.\n\nHaving attained **Supreme Sageship**, the **Emperor’s** act of accepting **flesh and blood** was also inevitable.\n\nYet the **Sage** transforms and guides the ignorant—nothing is beyond his capacity. Through **Divine Manifestations** and **Mysterious Transformations**, his true form remains unharmed.\n\nLet the discerning understand the **Divine Harmony**; do not be bound by mere words.\n\nFrom the eight hundred **kalpas** of severing attachments to study the **Dao**, through healing with medicine, teaching scriptures to deliver beings, and enduring humiliation while accepting offerings—such **ascetic practices** and **mysterious deeds** spanned **three thousand two hundred kalpas** before he attained the rank of **Golden Immortal**, bearing the fruit of **Unspoiled Perfection**, named **Pure and Natural Mysterious Awakened **Dharma** King**, teaching all **Bodhisattvas** and **Great **Sages** the sudden enlightenment of the **Great Vehicle’s True Doctrine**, gradually entering the **Void, Profound, True, and Mysterious Supreme Dao**.\n\nThe term **\"Thus-Come-One\"** signifies that all beings possess **Nature**—endowed with ten thousand virtues. Yet those who abandon this **Nature** fail to preserve heaven’s bestowal, their **True Suchness** obscured to the extreme, and they fall into mundane deeds.\n\nBefore his cultivation, the **Jade Emperor** abandoned the **Wondrous Bliss** royal station and spent another **three thousand two hundred kalpas**, his **virtues and transformations** boundless, never retreating, unattached and unstained, the **Great Awakened **Dharma** King**, encompassing heaven and earth, shaping all things—yet leaving none behind. Those who restore their **body and **Nature** to wholeness surpass even this by ten thousandfold; such is the **\"Thus-Come-One.\"**\n\nAfter such **great cultivation**, another ten million **kalpas** passed before he attained the rank of **Jade Emperor**, **Teacher of Ten Thousand **Heavens**.\n\nWhen **Primordial Heavenly Venerable** spoke these words, the **Pure Assembly** of **Dharma** in unison exclaimed in wonder, for such **Sagely Virtue** had never been witnessed before.\n\n**Reflection:** Man’s life is governed by **Yin** and **Yang**, his thoughts by **Principle** and **Desire**.\n\n**Yin** and **Yang** are interdependent, alternately waxing and waning;\n**Principle** and **Desire** cannot coexist—when **Desire** stirs, **Yin** congeals; when **Principle** is pure, **Yang** flourishes.\nFlourishing and reaching **Transformation**, one enters the **Divine and Mysterious**.\n\nWhat is placed is universally fitting, yet nothing is applied without effect.\nThe **Pure Yang** is the supreme virtue, yet the indolent cannot attain it.\n\nThe **Jade Emperor**, moved by pity, expounded profound truths, abandoning his royal throne without hesitation. Through eight hundred **kalpas**, he renounced his realm, severed ties of affection, and studied the **Great Dao**—this **mysterious conduct** is boundless and supreme.\n\nMoreover, the **Original Spirit** governs the **Soul’s Pavilion**, commands the five senses, and directs all ministers.\nAmong the six **desires** and seven **emotions**, affection is the heaviest.\nTo exhaust **desire** and return to **Principle**, to subdue **emotions** and restore **Nature**, to strip away all superficial adornments and alone grasp the **Mysterious and Secret**—this is also the **Celestial Sovereign’s** abandonment of his throne to seek the **Way**.\n\nHe administered **elixirs** to save lives, ensuring their peace and comfort.\nThe **Jade Emperor** again traversed eight hundred **kalpas** to benefit the world.\n\nMan’s **earthly toil** and **fantasies** blind him to true intent, leading him to old age and death without enlightenment—this is the world’s greatest affliction.\nTo refine the **Original Spirit**, **Essential Qi**, and the three grades of **elixir**, condensing them into **Secret Essence**, restoring **Yang** and transforming bones, living without deception and dying without loss—this is also the **inner alchemy** of saving lives through **elixirs**.\n\nHe expounded **sutras** to aid the realm, benefiting both the living and the dead.\nThe **Emperor** again traversed eight hundred **kalpas**.\n\nWhen man attains the **Mysterious** and penetrates the **Secret**, transforming **Yin** and **Yang** with marvelous skill, ascending to the **Highest Immortal**, rescuing ghosts and spirits—his body also embodies the silent transmission of **True Scriptures** to benefit the **Dark and Bright**.\n\nHe abandoned his life, discarded flesh and blood.\nThe **Emperor** again traversed eight hundred **kalpas**.\n\nWhen man’s heart remains undisturbed, casting off impurity, his body also embodies the **sacrifice of life**, enduring suffering, and abandoning flesh and blood.\n\nFrom **kalpa** to **kalpa**, with devout cultivation unchanging, pure and unstained, his transformations arise naturally, enabling all to awaken—his merit is boundless.\nThus, as the **Jade Emperor** cultivated from over three thousand **kalpas** to a hundred million, such **unparalleled marvels** are rare indeed.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Divine Abilities**\n\nAt that moment, among the assembly, a **Jade Maiden** named **Yèguāng** rose from her seat.\nShe adjusted her robes and crown with solemn grace, knelt long before the **Dao**, and addressed the **Heavenly Venerable**:\n\n*\"Your servant, in past lives, through what merit did I attain the honor of serving at Your presence, personally offering reverence and supply for countless **kalpas**?\nThe **Three Pure** realms—**Golden Gates** and **Jade Capital**—are serene, tranquil, and unbounded, filled with joy and ease. I have wandered the **Holy Domain**, savoring the **Sound of Law** like relishing flavors, yet never before witnessed such **rare and wondrous** deeds.\n\n**Ghost Valley Master** said:\nWhen the pure assembly marveled at the **Jade Emperor’s** words, I stood among the attendants. A **Jade Maiden**, named **Yèguāng**, arose from her seat, her robes and crown perfectly adorned.\nThough her attire was already pure and solemn, rising only heightened her dignity—thus, ‘adjusted her robes and crown with solemn grace.’\n\nShe moved with measured steps, kneeling long before the **Dao Ancestor**, and respectfully reported to the **Primordial Heavenly Venerable**:\n‘Your servant, **Yèguāng**, in past lives, through what cause did I attain the fortune of gazing upon and serving in the presence of the **Celestial Sovereign**?’\n\nSome might say **Yèguāng** refers to the **Jade Light** of the **Three Pure** realms, or question the origin of the **Jade Emperor’s** radiance, assuming it was the **Primordial’s** attendant.\nThis is incorrect.\nThe **Celestial Emperor** often attended the **Three Pure** realms during sermons, yet his **Jade Light** was not always visible.\nThus, the **Jade Maiden** spoke as such—there is no doubt she was the **Celestial Emperor’s** attendant.\n\nYour servant has served at Your presence not once, personally offering reverent supply for **a hundred million kalpas**.\nThe **Three Pure** mystical realms—**Golden Gates**, **Jade Capital**—are silent, pure, and effortless, filled with unbounded joy and supreme ease. I have delighted in divine wanderings, nourishing my senses with the **Sound of Law**.\n\n‘Savoring the **Sound of Law**’—the **True Secrets** of the **Pure and Lofty** are the highest **Dharma**, with inexhaustible flavors, not easily perceived.\nThough the **Jade Maiden** was divine, she was still a **saintly stream** being—how could she fully comprehend?\nThus, she listened to the **Law’s sound** and pondered its depths, as one who swallows fine food and savors its taste.\n\nThis refers to her past reflections, not today’s hearing of the **Primordial’s** words.\nIf interpreted as today’s event, it misses the original intent.\n\n**Yèguāng**, dwelling in the **Holy Realm** for ages, long serving at Your presence, found great delight.\nListening to the **Law’s sound**, she witnessed all marvels without fail, understanding them all—\nas the **Jade Emperor** universally radiated compassion, transforming and receiving beings at will, gathering and dispersing effortlessly, generating auspicious wonders, cultivating **True Essence** through **kalpas**, his merit boundless, guiding **saintly streams** to supreme awakening.\n\nThrough countless **kalpas**, she observed and discerned past ages, yet never before witnessed such **wondrous and unheard-of** deeds.\n\n**Reflection:** A woman’s **Yin-qi** is no different from an **Immortal Maiden**.\nHer **jade-like bones** and **ice-cold spirit** naturally possess grace and elegance.\nYet, stained by dust and defilement, obscured by long-standing filth, her **Yin-Dharma essence** sinks into impure thoughts and evil deeds;\nher **Six Ding-Yin spirits** become restless **hungry ghosts**.\nHer thoughts are endless, her days filled with restless striving—\nher meals and rest are never settled.\nHer movements are frantic, unable to ascend to **Heaven**, to serve the **Mysterious Origin**.\n\nShe indulges in reckless desires, craving luxuries and fame, binding herself with vanity, burdening herself with **earthly toil**, unable to attain ease and joy.\nShe follows the **Wheel of Rebirth**, descending into the **mundane world** without end.\nShe does not hear the **True Dao** or **Mysterious Law**, daily indulging in **desires**, constantly assailed by **demons**, with no chance of **transformation**.\nIf **Pure Yang** secretly transforms, nurturing **Yin-essence** into **truth**—\nher **pale moon** radiates boundless brilliance, her **jade body** reveals divine **transformation** without end;\nher entire being becomes supremely **numinous**,\nher **transformative essence** flows effortlessly, her **mysterious essence** gleams pure.\nShe bows in silence to the **Primordial**, worshipping the **Celestial Emperor** in stillness.\nHer **Nature and Dao** are ever-clear, her heart obeys the command.\"\n\nThe realm of the **Crimson Terrace** and **Purple Palace**,\nthe palace of the **Seven Treasures** and **Five Enlightenments**,\nis **serene and luminously empty**, where **effortless joy** prevails.\nThere, the **Divine** wanders through **mysterious domains**,\ntasting the **resonant sounds of celestial jade**—\na sight of **rare wonders** in the world,\na **true

**Dao/Way**,\naddressing the **Heavenly Sovereign**,\ninquiring about her **ancient causes**,\nand requesting the **Heavenly Emperor’s** **Mysterious Transformation**—\na **rare and wondrous** matter

Communication**,\nwhile those without the **Dao** descend into **darkly mundane states**,\nso the **True Practice** must be made clear.\n\n**Divine Communication** consists of **twenty-two chapters**:\n*\"The Radiant-Night Jade Maiden* did not discern how within the **Great Light**,\nthe **Ten Directions of All Heavens** appeared,\ntransforming into **Sacred Domains**,\nwhere the **Heavenly Emperor’s** **Mysterious Responsive** **Divine Transformation** **Law-Body** manifested,\nalong with **Heavenly Sovereigns**, **Great Saints**, **Mysterious Virtue Immortals**, and **Jade

Both the **hidden and the manifest**, the **sage and the common**, all partake in the **blessings of the Sage**. The **great radiance** is revealed, manifesting **rare and wondrous forms**, illuminating the **Heavens above**. The **Four Brahmā (Fàn) Realms** and **Six Desires (Liùyù)**, all the **lands of delight** and **divine assemblies of the True and Sage**, beholding this **radiance**, gather in their entirety. Below, it illuminates the **World of the Boundless Void (Wújí Shìjiè)**, akin to the **Pure Clarity Realm (Xuándū Jìng)**, approaching the **Nine Heavens**, where **spirit winds play melodies** and **tone and pitch harmonize**, resonating through the **cloud courts**, all forming **sacred scriptures**.

Today’s **celestial marvelous flowers** coalesce into a **Canopy**, sheltering the entire **dharma-feast**. All the gathered **divine assemblies** receive this **radiance’s virtue/power**.\n\nThe **thousand aeons’ merit** of your servants, the **Nine Heavens’ destiny**, the **Dao’s resplendent path**, and the **orthodox dharma’s flourishing**—today’s great auspiciousness fulfills the **lofty aspiration of sacred function**.\n\n**The True Lord of the Fire Sovereign (Huǒdì Zhēnjūn)** declared: *\"At the moment when the **Treasure Flowers coalesce into a Canopy**, sheltering all the gathered **divine assemblies**, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Celestial Sovereign** witnesses this **rare and wondrous event**, bowing his head and kneeling, then humbly reports to the **Celestial Venerable Emperor (Yùhuáng Dàdì)** and the **Great Jade Emperor (Yùhuáng Dàdì)**, saying: ‘Your lowly servant has been negligent and remiss, arriving late at the **dharma-feast**. Today’s auspicious hour and festive heavens coincide with the **Encountering of the Sacred Bridge of Compassionate Salvation**.’*\n\n**Bridge (Qiáo)** refers to what **mortals construct** to **cross rivers and streams**, avoiding **barefoot wading**. However, all **worldly bridges** require **wood or stone** to form, and their **salvage is limited**, prone to **damage and destruction**—even the **Great Yangtze, mighty rivers, and vast seas** cannot be crossed by such means.\n\nYet the **scriptural merit and sacred function’s virtue/power** **salvage the boundless eons**, **encircle the sand-realm (shājiè)**, without need of **construction or form**. Through **subtle transformation and divine mechanisms**, they **guide beings out of the River of Love**, **away from the Sea of Desire**, **free from the Blood Lake**, and **dispel the Flood Disaster**, enduring forever without decay—thus the term **Sacred Bridge of Compassionate Salvation**.\n\nBoth the **hidden and the manifest**, the **sage and the common**—all partake equally in the **blessings of the utmost sage**.\n\nThe Jade Emperor emitted the **Universal Radiant Great Bright Light**, manifesting the **rare and wondrous divine form**, illuminating all the **realms of the heavens**—the **Four Brahmā heavens, the Six Desire realms**, and every **pure land of bliss**. All **celestial beings, immortals, divine saints, and sacred assemblies** beheld this **Great Bright Light**, and **clouds swiftly gathered in assembly**.\n\nThe clouds converged—**suddenly filling the sky**, unknown in origin.\nThe **sacred assembly gathered like clouds**, hence the term **\"cloud-gathering\"**.\n\nIts light shone downward upon the **boundless worlds of the Lower Realm**, all aligned with the **Pure and Subtle Heavenly Pure Domain**, drawing near to the **Nine Sovereign Celestial Heights**. Within the light, **divine winds played celestial harmonies**, blending like **palace-scale and commercial tones** in perfect accord.\n\nThough **music’s five tones**—**metal, wood, water, fire, earth**—are divided into **pure and impure**, aligned with the **Five Phases**, their **natural marvels** may yet be hard to replicate. Yet the **Heavenly Divine Winds** harmonize effortlessly, surpassing mortal music. Their **resonant, vibrant sounds** in the **Cloud Court** all coalesce into the **Three Caverns’ Precious Chapters**.\n\nAll beings in the **Lower Realms** attained the **Great Dao’s profound transformation**. The **Yin-Tu prisons**, the **Iron Encircled City**, the **Eternal Night of the Nine Abysses**—all tormented souls in the **Nine Hells** now **reverently submit to the Jade Emperor’s Great Bright Light’s power**, ascending to **celestial palaces** and receiving **bliss**.\n\nToday, the **Heavenly Treasures’ wondrous flowers** I scattered **swirled and formed a canopy**, **overshadowing the sacred law-assembly’s gathering**, all **reverently submitting to the Heavenly Sovereign Jade Emperor’s mighty virtue and divine power**.\n\nI, the **Clear and Bright Heavenly Sovereign**, and others—this is not merely fortune for one age. Encountering this **rare marvel**, we have cultivated **meritorious causes across countless eons**, now meeting the **Nine-Heaven’s auspicious convergence**. The **Heavenly Dao’s boundless expanse** flourishes, the **Supreme Mysterious Law** thrives in grandeur.\n\nOne says: *\"The Primordial Sovereign’s enlightenment unfolded the **Supreme Law**, the **august winds** were pure and vast, the **Dao** spread evenly—no heretical paths existed, just the **flourishing of the True Law**.\"* This is acceptable.\n\nToday’s **auspicious hour** is **greatly fortunate**. All **celestial beings and myriad creatures** attain the **Supreme Mysterious Transformation’s blessings**.\n\nOne also says: *\"All aspire to revere the **Mysterious Function**, humbly presenting the **Dao’s essentials**.\"* This too is acceptable.\n\nIn reflection: Though the **human body is small**, it **embodies heaven and earth**, containing all things, encompassing all marvels. The **pure, empty, and refined qi** governs the **Six Yang**, and there exists the **High and Pure Clear-Bright Heavenly Sovereign**.\n\nIf the **original spirit wanders unmastered**, the **profound transformation remains unseen**, one **sinks into the waves of grace**, the **mechanism drowned in the sea of suffering**. The **great currents and monstrous tides** surge endlessly—how can one **avoid drowning**, **rescue the deluded**?\n\nIf **one alone is immersed**, they **plunge others into ruin**, harming self and others—this need not be discussed. Those **stagnant in the lesser vehicle**, **bewildered by tangential paths**, their **flow without source**, **inevitably dry up**—this too is unworthy of mention.\n\nSometimes, the **spiritual source is deepened**, the **Dao’s pulse connected**, nearly **transformed**. Yet if one **hoards their essence**, the **grace descends not**, and this is **far from ultimate attainment**.\n\nThus, some **realize the fruits of the Four Brahmā and Six Desire realms** but **fail to reach the Nine Sovereign’s Seven-Treasured Domain**, receiving **human blessings** or becoming **prison wardens and demon kings**, even **sinking into the Three Evil Paths** and **Nine Abyssal Realms**—**woe beyond measure!**\n\nWhen the **profound transformation is not manifest**, the **wondrous resonance unseen**, the **true scriptures fail to circulate**, the **jade flowers lack luster**—this stems from **not planting meritorious causes**, **not trusting the True Law**. Unable to **hear the boundless, even Dao**, one **cannot revere the Mysterious Function**.\n\nIf one **concentrates the Mysterious Spirit**, becomes the **Heavenly Sovereign**, the **pure, empty, and refined essence**—when the **later stages unfold**, they **penetrate Caoqi’s grove**, **absorb the Western River’s essence**, **merge with the Golden Elixir**, and **ascend to the Dao’s shore**. The **sea of suffering and karmic pits** are **forever annihilated**; one **transcends the Six Desires**, **rises above the Four Brahmā**, **gathers all spirits**, and **illuminates the hidden realms**.\n\nThe **divine winds stir the true**, the **wondrous resonance is unparalleled**—the **true scriptures circulate without cessation**, all things **receive endless grace**. The **Yin-Tu prisons are broken**, the **Nine Abysses illuminated**, the **hells transformed into pure lands**, and **sinful beings attain bliss**. One’s **darkness turns to radiance**; the **jade flowers bloom in crimson hues**, **overshadowing all marvels**. This is the **real and void’s essence**, the **original spirit’s power**.\n\nWithout **cultivating virtuous causes**, **firmly trusting the True Law**, how could one **hear the Heavenly Dao’s refreshing winds**, **revere the Mysterious Function**?\n\nAh! This **body’s true marvel**—**witnessing the Clear-Bright Heavenly Sovereign’s later law-assembly**, **celebrating the Sacred Bridge’s encounter**. **Proclaiming the Sacred Transformation**, **extolling the Mysterious Function**—this is the **Dao’s salvation for both hidden and manifest beings**.\n\nTo **cultivate meritorious causes**, **broaden wondrous deeds**, **not seeking swift transformation**—the **marvel is natural**. This too **verifies the Sacred True Precepts**.\n\nLet those who **seek the Dao** savor this **of their own accord**.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Divine Powers**\n\nAt that time, during this **sacred assembly**, all **revered the Mysterious Function**.\n\nThe **High and Pure Clear-Bright Heavenly Sovereign**—as explained before—**with verses praised the Jade Emperor**:\n\n*\"Clear-Bright Heavenly Sovereign,*\n*With verses, the Jade Emperor is praised.*\n\n*The Golden Gate’s Primordial Vault Sovereign,*\n*(Note: Some texts read ‘Sovereign’ instead of ‘Vault.’ Examining the scripture’s intent, the Jade Emperor is the Heavenly Sovereign, the **Buddhas’ teacher**, ruling the **Yellow Golden Gate**, the **Pure Vault’s Azure Expanse’s ancestral elder**—hence ‘Sovereign.’ Some read ‘Sovereign,’ referring merely to the Heavenly Emperor.)*\n\n*The Highest Jade Sovereign’s Venerable One,*\n*(As explained before.)*\n\n*Whose wondrous form surpasses all heavens.*\n*(All celestial beings and gods possess beautiful forms—some decayed or limited by their heavens’ transformations, unable to fully manifest.

vary with their wisdom and insight.\nThe Great Vehicle is rare to hear.\nThe Jade Emperor’s teachings clearly demonstrate the **true宗 (zong)**, penetrating both high and low,\nembracing all grades.\nAll beings benefit from his instruction, all attain liberation—\nthis is the **Great Vehicle’s descending speech**.\n\nThe **True One points out the lost path**.\nThe Jade Emperor, with the **true宗 (zong) and mysterious unity of wondrous principle**,\nclearly illuminates and awakens those lost—\nthis is the **direct pointing, single transmission**, preventing beings from falling into minor, tangential teachings.\nIt is to guide them along the **great path**, so they do not stray into false ways.\n\nHis **virtue and power are as boundless as the void**.\nAll things under heaven have limits.\nOnly the void endures through kalpas without change.\nThe Jade Emperor’s **great virtue and supreme power** are immeasurable, like the void—\ninexhaustible, beyond reckoning.\nOther gods possess virtue and power, some distant, some near, some small, some great,\nbut they can only be compared proportionally.\nThe Jade Emperor’s virtue and power have no equal—\nthus, like the void, they are **praiseworthy without end**.\n\nPraise for the Jade Emperor, like the void, is inexhaustible.\nReverence for him is boundless.\nPraise is without limit.\nHis **august virtue cannot be named**.\n\nYellow Stone Master said:\n*\"The Highest, Clear, and Illuminating Heavenly Sovereign,\nthough he may appear later at the Law Assembly,\ntruly saw the Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformations—\ndivine mien and marvelous sights—\nand, filled with reverence, composed this wondrous verse\nto praise the Jade Emperor.\"*\n\nIn ancient times, Zai Wo, Zi Gong, and You Ruo praised Confucius with profound insight,\ndemonstrating wisdom sufficient to know the Sage.\nNow, the Clear and Illuminating Heavenly Sovereign praises the Jade Emperor’s virtue as boundless,\nhis praise without end—\nno other eulogy matches this depth.\nThis is the wisdom of Zai Wo, Zi Gong, and You Ruo in recognizing Confucius.\nThis verse may truly be called **profound speech**.\n\n**My humble reflection:**\nThe **original spirit of the human body** remains unaltered through kalpas.\nThe **true master of the four limbs** is the **source of all things**.\nIts wondrous excellence surpasses the six yang,\nits compassion protects the Three Elements.\nIt is the **true teacher of the self**—\nthe **qi and spirit** upon which all depends.\n\nIts **illuminating light and resonant sound** are the **supreme Law**,\ndirectly shattering delusion,\nguiding one to **universal practice**,\nembodying **mysterious essence and wondrous function**.\nWhere its **virtue extends**, it equals the void.\nHow could praise for it ever be exhausted?\nIf one cannot **turn inward and reflect**, failing to recognize this **true宗 (zong)**,\nhow could they know the Jade Emperor’s virtue?\nHow much less could they grasp the **benefits of the scriptures**?\nIt is no wonder they fail to **secretly awaken to the true body**.\n\nThe Clear and Illuminating Heavenly Sovereign, gazing upon the Jade Emperor’s virtue,\ncomposed this wondrous verse to praise him—\nnot only to exalt the **Heavenly Blessing**,\nbut also to **command humanity to turn inward**.\n\nIf one truly **harmonizes with the original truth**,\nknows the **power of the Law**,\nfollows Heaven without partiality,\nand shares in the Emperor’s virtue,\nthey will not be confused by other paths,\nwill not lose Heaven’s treasure,\nand may aspire to the **supreme Sage**.\n**Aspiring scholars, take heed!**\n\n**Chapter on Divine Transformations (Twenty-Eight Sections):**\nHe is the **Sovereign of the Vaulting Sky**, the **Exalted One of kalpas**,\npossessing **wondrous vision and wondrous knowledge**,\nunequaled, unmatched.\nHe is **profoundly still and purely true**, neither absent nor present,\nthe **supreme Sage and supreme Spirit**,\nthe **great divine transformation**,\nthe **treasure-house of light**,\nthe **great man** who **enlightens heaven and humanity**,\nteaching without end,\nwith **great compassion and great mercy**,\nrolling forth the **Law Wheel**.\n\nFor the sake of **delivering all beings**, he is called the **Jade Emperor**,\nthe **True Elder of the Vaulting Sky**,\n**pure and clear**, **wise and eloquent**,\nthe **supreme Dao and supreme Sovereign**.\n\nHe opens the path for all beings—\nthus, he emits this light.\n\nAt that time, the **Highest, Clear, and Illuminating Heavenly Sovereign**\nfinished his verse of praise and sat in silent stillness.\n\nWei Boyang said:\n*\"The Highest, Clear, and Illuminating Heavenly Sovereign extolled the Jade Emperor’s virtue—\nnot merely with ten lines of praise.\nThis Jade Emperor is the **august and solemn Sovereign of the Vaulting Sky**,\nthe **Exalted One of kalpas**.\nAll kalpas have their numbers—\nwhether billions or myriads—\nyet none can truly be called ‘vast.’\nThe Jade Emperor has, from antiquity, been the **preceptor of the ten thousand heavens**,\nenduring kalpas beyond count,\nhis breadth and depth beyond

and wondrous—\nnone can equal or compare to him.\nHe shines **purely luminous and profoundly still**,\n**towering and unmoving**, yet **quiet and boundless**,\nhis Dao **true and unchanging**, **unstained and unsullied**,\nhis **virtue supremely pure**.\nIf he seems **vanished**, it is not true vanishing—\nmerely the **natural emptiness of the void**.\nIf he seems **present**, it is not clinging to existence—\nmerely the **wondrous non-duality of the formless**.\nIf he seems **both present and vanished**, it is **indescribable and beyond analysis**.\n\nAll **immortals, Buddhas, and

unmatched.\n\nNow he **enlightens and delivers** all beings,\nthus he manifests the **great compassion and universal luminous virtue/power**.\n\nAt that time, the **High and Void Pure-Luminous Heavenly Sovereign** spoke this **gāthā** in praise,\nthen sat in **silent stillness**.\n\n**My humble reflection**: The **original spirit** of the human body is the **Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven**,\nalso called **True Sovereign**, **Mysterious Ancestor**, **Ancestral Reality**, **Heavenly Lord**, **Essence of Nature**, **Ancestral True Sovereign**, **Dharma-nature**, **Wondrous Luminous True Mind**, **Pure Nature**, **Playful Spirit**, **True Master**, **Playful Light**, **Great Staff**, **Dharma King**, **Wondrous Treasure**, **True Root**, **Buddha-nature**, **True Seed**, and **Elixir Origin**.\n\nThe **True Sovereign** of one’s being—\n**divine, wondrous, and peerless**—\n**luminous essence** without end,\n**enlightening yin and yang**,\nwhose **spiritual intelligence** is beyond measure.\n\nHe **compassionately nurtures** all wonders,\n**responds universally** with perfect clarity.\n\nMost **exalted and noble**, his **transformative efficacy** is endless.\nSilently merging with **refined qi**,\nhe **nurtures the true spirit**.\n\nThus, the **true light** occasionally reveals itself,\nand the **wondrous mechanism** perpetually generates.\n\nThose who truly grasp this\nwill **spontaneously produce the divine embryo**,\nand share the **Jade Emperor’s merit and virtue/power**—\nhis **Dao-transformation** is boundless.\n\nOnly when one **affirms the Pure-Luminous Heavenly Sovereign’s gāthā** in praise of the Jade Emperor\ndoes one attain **true knowledge and genuine awakening**.\n\nOtherwise, the **true wondrousness** is unattained,\nand the **Jade Emperor’s transformation** remains unrecognized.\n\nThe **Pure-Luminous gāthā**—\nif recited as though in a dream,\nhow could one gain the **fruit of the scriptures**,\nor attain **real benefit**?\n\nAlas! The **Dao of Nature** resides within us—\nthe **true wondrousness** is self-sufficient.\n\nIf one **comprehends the wondrous luminous mechanism**,\nthen one truly **responds to and upholds the Jade Emperor’s radiant virtue/power**.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine on Divine Powers**\n\nThus, the **Heavenly Sovereign** again instructed the **Four Assemblies**:\n\n\"This **Jade Emperor’s body** is the **Dao-body** itself—\n**not an ordinary form**.\n\nThis is the **body of boundless merit/virtue**,\nthe **body of pure and pristine naturalness**,\nthe **firmly luminous, unshakable true void, supreme

majestic,\nbeyond all description.\n\n**The Barefoot Immortal** said:\n\"The **Pure-Luminous Heavenly Sovereign** praised the Jade Emperor in a gāthā,\nthen sat in silent stillness once more.\n\nAt this moment, the **Originating Heavenly Sovereign** again instructed the **Four Assemblies** in the **Dharma-gathering**:\n\n\"This **Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformation** is the **Great Dao-body** itself—\n**not an ordinary form**.\n\nThe **Dao** is formless—\nhow can one speak of a **body**?\n\nThough the **Dao** is **void and formless**,\nboundless and endless,\nit **transforms all things**,\nachieves the **beginning and end**,\nstirring **yin and yang** without pause—\n**true void yet with substantial essence**,\nnot merely empty.\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s **merit/virtue** is like the **void**,\nhis **spirit** aligns with the **Dao**,\nthus it is said: *‘The Emperor’s body is the Dao-body—*\n**not an ordinary form.’**\n\nThis is the **body of boundless merit/virtue**,\nthe **body of true purity and pristine naturalness**, unconstrained.\n\n**Merit** has limits,\n**virtue** has bounds—\nhow could they be **endless**?\n\nThe Jade Emperor **transforms all worlds**,\nunchanged since ancient times—\nwhere are the limits?\n\n**Colored forms and images** are **constrained and stagnant**,\nnot **pure, pristine, and naturally free**.\n\nThe Jade Emperor is **never stained or attached**,\nachieving **great ease and freedom**—\nis this not **naturalness**?\n\nThis is the **divinely luminous, firm, and unyielding**,\nthe **true void that never

**firm and unyielding**,\nnor **divinely luminous**.\n\nThe **Great Void** exists,\nand thus the **void** becomes **true reality**.\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s **spirit and penetration** endure through all ages unharmed,\nhis **playful light** shines across **kalpas** undimmed—\nnot only **most divine and luminous**,\nbut **firm as unpolished jade**,\n**unbreakable as the void itself**,\n**never

**spiritual radiance**—\nhow could they be **easily fathomed or explored**?\nVast and magnanimous,\nboundless and great—\nhis **name and reputation** are beyond thought,\n**pervading and filling** all

virtue/power** in perfecting nature,\nyet they **do not ultimately preserve** their attainment.\n\nThus, **people cannot exhaust the spirit** to **attain transformation**,\nnor **return to the void** to become **immortal**,\nnor **merge with the Dao** to realize **true reality**.\n\nOnly the **name of supreme sovereignty** is **never destroyed**—\nthe Jade Emperor, who **takes the Dao as his

**dependent** on **deliberate actions** or **merit/virtue** cultivated through **strenuous effort**.\nIn the past, though He **descended** to **receive birth** among mortals,\nspanning countless **eons** to **broadly manifest teachings**,\ndisplaying **great divine powers**,\nHis **manifestation**—\nlike **abandoning kingship** to **practice**, severing **affection** to **seek the Dao/Way**,\nadministering **medicine** to **heal illnesses**, expounding **teachings** and **propagating transformation**,\n**enduring suffering** and **delighting in renunciation**—\nattained the **rank of Golden Immortal**,\nand **taught Bodhisattvas** across **many eons**.\n\nThus, the **scriptures of liberation** record the **cause and effect** of **Buddhas and living beings**,\nsaying that from **Tushita Heaven**,\nHe **rode the fragrant elephant** and **descended** into the **womb of Maya**,\nthereby giving birth to **the Sage of the World**.\nThis too is but one **manifestation** of the **Celestial Sovereign’s** **adaptive teachings**.\n\nElsewhere, He **attended the assembly of the floating lotus**,\n**presided over the gathering of the precious pearl**,\n**transformed into the

**Dharma-body** remains **pure and pristine**,\n**majestic and unshakable**—\nnever ceasing to **abide in the Golden Palace**.\nWhen the Primordial Sage was about to **proclaim the Jade

measure**—\nHis **divine intelligence** is **wondrous**, and His **Dao/Way** is **manifest**.\nThus, it is clear that the **Celestial Sovereign** is not **dependent** on **merit/virtue** cultivated through **deliberate actions**.\n\nI **reflect**: the **primordial spirit** of humanity\nremains **vast and unchanging** as the **eons**,\nits **divine radiance** **wondrous and profound**—\nhow could it be **named** by **words**?\nMuch less could it **arise** from **actions of the heart**!\n\n**Perception, hearing, awareness, and knowledge**—\n**actions of standing, sitting, or lying

**merit/virtue** **beyond conception**—\nah!\n\nThis is the **inherent nature** of **Dao/Way-practitioners**,\nnot **dependent** on **deliberate actions**,\nnor **achievable** by **stubborn

radiance of His body**,\nall **possessing wondrous names**.\nThe **Great Divine Perfections Radiance**—\nthe **Great Compassionate Radiance**,\nthe **Great Joyous Renunciation Radiance**,\nthe **Great Enduring Suffering Radiance**,\nthe **Great Equanimous Radiance**,\nthe **Great Gentle Harmony Radiance**,\nthe **Great Autonomous Radiance**,\nthe **Great Beneficial Radiance**,\nthe **Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiance**,\nthe **Great Wisdom Radiance**,\nthe **Great Auspicious Radiance**,\nthe **Great Liberation Radiance**,\nthe **Great Refuge Radiance**,\nthe **Great Merit/Virtue Radiance**,\nthe **Great Perfect Radiance**,\nthe **Great Unobstructed Radiance**,\nthe **Radiance No One Can Surpass**.\nThe **Great Wisdom True Person** says:\nAll the **great radiance** **emitted** by the **Celestial Sovereign’s** **body**\n**possesses supreme and wondrous names**.」\n\nThe **Great Radiance** names are thus: the **Great God-Transcending Radiance**, the **Great Compassionate Radiance**, the **Great Joyous Renunciation Radiance**, the **Great Enduring Suffering Radiance**, the **Great Equanimous Radiance**, the **Great Gentle Harmony Radiance**, the **Great Autonomous Radiance**, the **Great Beneficial Radiance**, the **Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiance**, the **Great Wisdom Radiance**, the **Great Auspicious Radiance**, the **Great Liberation Radiance**, the **Great Refuge Radiance**, the **Great Virtue/Power Radiance**, the **Great Perfect Radiance**, the **Great Unobstructed Radiance**, and the **Radiance No One Can Surpass**—these are the seventeen great radiance lights.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** universally extends and illuminates all things, with wondrous deeds and accumulated proofs, possessing great **virtue/power** and **qi** and attaining the six **god-transcending** abilities. The **Great God-Transcending Radiance** is resplendent, pervading all. This is the first radiance name.\n\nNext, the **Celestial Sovereign** possesses great compassion and great pity; compassion and pity are boundless, and the radiance is wondrous and vast. The **Great Compassionate Radiance** is the second.\n\nAgain, the **Celestial Sovereign** truly rejoices in renunciation; renunciation is boundless, and the wondrous radiance universally shines. The **Great Joyous Renunciation Radiance** is the third.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** has endured great suffering through countless eons; endurance is limitless, and the radiance is unceasing, with no obstruction. The **Great Enduring Suffering Radiance** is the fourth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** has practiced great equanimity in the past; equanimity is unending, and the radiance is unassailable. The **Great Equanimous Radiance** is the fifth.\n\nIn past eons, the **Celestial Sovereign** has also cultivated great gentle harmony; gentle and yielding, yet tranquil and harmonious, this vast **Dao/Way** never alters, and the radiance pervades all, inexhaustible. The **Great Gentle Harmony Radiance** is the sixth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign’s** **virtue/power** is serene and unchanging, transcending all and autonomous. The radiance is vast and boundless, with no end. The **Great Autonomous Radiance** is the seventh.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign’s** benevolence is boundless, encompassing all and benefiting them eternally; the benefits are endless, and the law’s radiance universally illuminates. The **Great Beneficial Radiance** is the eighth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign’s** body transcends all proofs and attains wondrous awakening, pure and natural. The **Celestial Sovereign** is the **Dharma King** of the **Buddha’s** coming, and after countless eons of cultivation, the **Celestial Sovereign** attains this station. Thus, the greatest **virtue/power** emerges from the mindless, and **god-transcending** transformations align with wishes. The **Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiance** is the ninth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** possesses great wisdom and great **palpitating insight** (大慧). Wisdom and insight surpass all kinds, and the radiance is peerless. The **Great Wisdom Radiance** is the tenth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** is fundamentally the most exalted goodness, forever auspicious. With this radiance, all is illuminated without cessation. The **Great Auspicious Radiance** is the eleventh.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** has long understood and attained great liberation; liberation is natural and unconstrained, and the golden radiance endures. The **Great Liberation Radiance** is the twelfth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** aligns with the **Great Dao/Way**, and the wondrous law is natural and unchanging. The **Celestial Sovereign** has maintained true faith through countless eons, never generating doubt or regression. All beings in the ten directions and future ages universally revere and submit to this eternal radiance, never dimming. The **Great Refuge Radiance** is the thirteenth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** universally saves all beings without exception, with **virtue/power** most vast, and the radiance shines eternally without depletion. The **Great Virtue/Power Radiance** is the fourteenth.\n\nWith **virtue/power** complete and the **Dao/Way** fulfilled, the **Celestial Sovereign’s** **virtue/power** is perfect, and the radiance endures forever in splendor. The **Great Perfect Radiance** is the fifteenth.\n\nThough stained by dust, the **Celestial Sovereign** is inherently pure; **god-transcending** transformations are complete and radiant, and the **Celestial Sovereign’s** **virtue/power** shines eternally without obstruction. The **Great Unobstructed Radiance** is the sixteenth.\n\nAmong **god-transcending** beings, this is the most noble; among sages, this is the most revered. The **Celestial Sovereign** is the master of all heavens, the teacher of all **Buddhas**, and no being in the vast **Dao/Way** of the **Dharma Realm** can compare to the **Celestial Sovereign**. Therefore, the radiance perpetually fills all realms, and the **god-transcending** transformations are beyond measure. Is not the **Radiance No One Can Surpass** the seventeenth great radiance?\n\nAs for these seventeen great radiance lights of **god-transcending** and wondrous meaning, only the **Celestial Sovereign** of today can truly perceive them. How can **god-transcending** beings measure this?\n\nThe fool notes: In the mortal world, upright nature is the root. Therefore, the **Dao/Way** of immortals is actualized, with this as the **Great Radiance** seed. Yet though all true seeds are possessed, none preserve them. Thus, in the field of delusion, one must cultivate and purify the **karma** of causes and conditions.\n\nTherefore, there is one kind of supreme excellent cause, and there is one level of **god-transcending** and wondrous radiance. The **Celestial Sovereign** has cultivated countless wondrous deeds, which are beyond measure. Why speak of seventeen great radiance lights? It is because the **Dao/Way** is profound and difficult to comprehend, and the transformations are intricate, making the **Dao/Way** dim.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign’s** seventeen radiance lights are like the **Buddha’s** manifestation of the **Dharmakāya** (丈六身), with the crown emitting the **Great Auspicious Radiance**. Moreover, the **Celestial Sovereign’s** radiance is supremely wondrous, transcending all kinds. Who can trace the wondrous deeds or recognize the seventeen great meanings?\n\nAlas, this is rare and difficult to attain! The **Dao/Way** is inherently within oneself; neglect leads to dimness, while diligence brings clarity. Cultivate the **Way** of **non-action** (无为) with steadfast effort, and do not seek swift **god-transcending** transformations. The **Dao/Way** will naturally be obtained.\n\nThus, the thirty-second chapter of the **God-Transcending** section states: Therefore, you mortals who desire to see the **Celestial Sovereign** yet cannot do so, it is because you still cling to the **body** and **mouth** (身口), failing to abandon your **karmic habits** (结习). Your **afflictions** and deeds are ever-present.\n\nBecause of these obstructions, you cannot behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s** compassionate visage. Now, I proclaim the **Dharma** of breaking through these obstructions for you, the assembly of the **Dharma**. You, the great assembly, should each earnestly follow this.\n\nAt that time, all the great assembly rejoiced and leapt for joy, bowing their heads before the **Highest Venerable One** (至尊) and the **mortal** (凡) alike, all desiring to hear the teachings.\n\nThe **Thunder Sage** (雷师), **Bright Old Man** (皓翁), said: The **Celestial Sovereign** emits seventeen great radiance lights, transcending all measure. Therefore, you lofty, pure, and clear **Celestial Sovereigns** and **masters of the heavens** (高虚清明天主等), who desire to truly see the **Celestial Sovereign** yet cannot do so, it is because though you have no dusty stains, you have not yet attained the station of the **Celestial Sovereign**. The **Great Vehicle** (大乘) of supreme wondrousness has not been truly understood.\n\nYou still cling to the **body** and **mouth** (身口), failing to abandon **karmic habits** from countless eons, **ignorance** and **afflictions**, **mortal** deeds and transgressions. Because of these obstructions, you cannot behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s** compassionate visage.\n\n**Karmic habits** (结习), **emotional desires**, and dusty **mortal** things: all delusions and entanglements are fundamentally not to be coveted. Yet due to insufficient wisdom and excessive attachment to thoughts, the rise of perceptions leads to gradual staining and clinging. Interacting with things and beings, these entanglements grow ever deeper, forming **karmic toxins** (结毒) that solidify into **habits** (习气).\n\nLike a man binding himself with ropes, it is difficult to untangle in a moment. Deep-rooted **karmic habits** and past stains are hard to remove once they have taken hold. The **karmic seeds** and **roots of deeds** are inherently impure; clinging to **mortal** desires may either harbor **afflictions** or accumulate transgressions, or plant **karmic seeds**, entangling one in endless **karma**, restless and chaotic. The **afflictions** and disturbances have not yet been dispelled, and the **karmic deeds** of past lives continue to obstruct.\n\nEven though you govern the **Brahma realms** (梵天), you have not yet attained ultimate clarity, nor do you fully comprehend the **Heavenly Mysteries** (重玄). How could you then behold the most supreme **Celestial Sovereign**? This is why you cannot see the **Celestial Sovereign**.\n\nNow I proclaim to you, the gathered assembly, the method for cutting through and removing obstructions. You, the great assembly, should each uphold and practice it with sincerity.\n\nAt that time, the great assembly, overcome with joy and exultation, all knelt before the **Celestial Sovereign’s** jade case, bowing their heads and prostrating, reverently offering their respects, all desiring to hear the secret discourse on dispelling obstructions.\n\n*\"I\"* refers to **Primordial Beginning** (元始), *\"case\"* (几) means *\"table.\"* A note: From birth, each has inherent predispositions. Though the **Great Cycle** (元会) begins anew and the **Great Harmony qi** (太和之气) flows, the accumulated habits of past eons are not easily forgotten. Thus, the scriptures liken predestined **karmic affinities** to accumulated toxins—a true insight.\n\nTherefore, those with **affinities for joy** will find kindred hearts across distant realms, while those bound by **malevolent affinities** may stand face-to-face yet remain a thousand miles apart. Do not dismiss the *Dao Canon*’s **functional frameworks** or Buddhist scriptural records as heretical—even in Confucian texts, Yan Ying’s opposition to Confucius was later attributed to **fate’s decree**. The great scholars Cheng Yi and Su Shi split into the **Shu** and **Lu factions**, another case of **incompatible affinities**. Yet even those who must rely on one another often meet with estrangement—a lament shared across ages. Can the doctrine of **affinities** then be entirely discarded?\n\nThus, the **Ten Perceptions** are inexhaustible, the **Five Aggregates** unfathomable, the **Thirteen Disciples** and **Twenty-Five Magical Seeds** endless, the **Seven False and Three True** transformations intricate—who can easily escape them all?\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign**, having attained the **Pure and Bright Heavenly Lord’s** imperial throne, though freed from earthly defilements, still bears the **accumulated karma of past kalpas**, not yet fully transcended. His essence lingers in the **lofty void**, known as **Pure and Bright**. Past virtuous causes remain untouched by the **void’s embrace**. How could one who embodies **Void-Luminous Perfection** like the **Celestial Sovereign** be seen at once?\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures note that even **Bodhisattvas**, in their practice, may see the face of the **Tathāgata** yet fail to truly behold him. When the **Dharma-body Buddha** expounds the **supreme truth**, the Bodhisattvas listen in silence—this is the same principle. The **Most Sage** is not easily seen; the obstructions of **body and speech habits** are not easily dispelled.\n\nYet this truth is most difficult to grasp. To *\"see\"* the **Celestial Sovereign** is not to see him with the eyes; to **comprehend** his **Way** is to **penetrate** his **virtue**. As in Confucius’ door—those who truly receive the **Master’s transmission of the heart-mind**, one in essence—though times and worlds differ, the principle remains the same. **Spiritual communion** and **heart-meeting** alone yield true vision.\n\nEven **Yan Hui**, the bright and discerning disciple, failed to grasp the **subtle interval**; how then could the **Pure and Bright Heavenly Lord** see the **Celestial Sovereign**, and why doubt it?\n\nThe **Primordial Beginning’s** method of **breaking through obstructions** lies in **luminous predestined practice**, **penetrating the heart’s essence**, and **repelling and harmonizing**—once the outer obstructions dissolve, the **Celestial Sovereign** is seen. Thus, the assembly longs to hear it.\n\nAlas! Obstructions arise from the heart; breaking them depends on the **self**. The **Great Unimpeded Way** is within your **original spirit**—do not grow weary in crossing. **Coarse traces of speech and hearing** should not become hindrances. Is the **Great Dao** not within you? Strive onward.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Perfection of Spiritual Penetration**\nThe **Celestial Worthy** spoke: *\"The method of cutting through obstructions lies in generating **great wisdom**, free from doubt, free from **greed and anger**, free from **lustful desires**, free from **envy and jealousy**, free from **harm and killing**, free from **mundane emotions**, free from **mundane thoughts**, free from **delusion and filth**, free from **sounds and colors**, free from **right and wrong**, free from **hatred and love**, free from **discrimination**, free from **arrogance**, free from **attachment**.\"*\n\n**Master Guangcheng** said: *\"The **Primordial Beginning Celestial Worthy**, responding to the Pure Assembly’s request for the **mystery of unobstructed perfection**, spoke thus: To cut through obstructions and behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s** wondrous transformation and luminous visage, the **Way** is none other than generating **divine wisdom and great enlightenment**, firmly believing in the **True Path**, free from **doubt, wavering, and confusion**. The **Great Dao** is supremely upright; **True Unity** admits no duality—there is nothing to doubt or confuse.\n\nIf **clarity** is insufficient to discern the **subtle signs**, one may cling to **contradictory extremes**, lacking steadfast vision, and **demonic knowledge** seizes the opportunity. Once one knows the **Great Dao** resides within, **knowing and guarding firmly**, do not waver with **duality**, nor mix with **triplicity**—what more is there to doubt? Without doubt, there is no confusion; the **Dao** can be entered.\n\nThus, the **great wisdom** that cuts through obstructions and purifies **accumulated habits** must first be free from doubt. Seekers of the **Way** must not measure progress by **worldly gains**, nor rely on external means. **Anger, resentment, indignation, and grievance** must all be abandoned.\n\nThe second obstruction to cut: **greed and anger**. Let the mind be **single-minded in the Dao**; its sincerity will follow naturally. **Nurturing private desires** and **wandering thoughts** easily arise—even a hair’s breadth of **lewd indulgence or craving** greatly disturbs the **True**.\n\nThe third obstruction: **lustful desires**. The **Dao** encompasses all; the **virtuous and unworthy** are both my teachers. If you harbor the slightest **resentment toward the capable** or **disdain for the foolish**, it is a grave error.\n\nThe fourth obstruction: **envy and jealousy**. The **Great Dao** is supremely compassionate, **unbearingly tolerant**. If, out of **hostility or malice**, you nurture **destructive intentions**, you stray far from the **Way**.\n\nThe fifth obstruction: **harm and killing**. Though the *Yin-Xing Classic* speaks of **\"killing the mechanism\"**, it means subduing **evil demons** so that **ultimate truth** may act freely. As in **autumn’s killing frost**, when plants return to the roots and **life’s vitality withdraws**, one sees the **compassion of Heaven and Earth**—this is not the **world’s** notion of killing. It is also said: *\"Harm gives rise to kindness.\"* This reflects the **mind-intent of Heaven and Earth**, not the **world’s** notion of harm.\n\nThe **Great Dao** acts without action; **emotions and perceptions** are not employed. A single **mundane impulse** leads to boundless error.\n\nThe sixth obstruction: **mundane emotions**. The **Dao’s intent** requires **pure thoughts**. Any **dust-thought** brings boundless ruin.\n\nThe seventh obstruction: **mundane thoughts**. The **Dao** is **unblemished purity**; the slightest **delusion or filth** betrays the **ultimate truth**.\n\nThe eighth obstruction: **sounds and colors**. To seek the **Dao** through them is to distance oneself from it. Those who embody the **Dao** do not merely avoid **external sounds and colors**—they remain untouched by the **world**, standing beyond the **Dao’s ripples and shores**, seeking and clinging to nothing.\n\nThe ninth obstruction to be severed: **no arising of sounds and colors**.\n\nThe **Dao** is **Great Unity** in its essence. The slightest affirmation or negation betrays its **original true nature**.\n\nThe tenth obstruction: **no arising of right and wrong**. Though Mencius says, *\"The mind of right and wrong, all people possess,\"*—**great wisdom** is like **foolishness**; why would one cling to distinctions of right and wrong?\n\nThe **Dao** knows no preference or rejection. Love or hatred obstructs the **true**.\n\nThe eleventh obstruction: **no arising of hatred or love**. The **principle** is **without duality**; applying **discriminating intelligence** is not the **Dao**.\n\nThe twelfth method of severing obstructions: **no arising of distinctions**. Seeing the **Dao** clearly, transcending the **mundane**, disdaining worldly affairs—**arrogance** greatly violates the **Way**.\n\nThe thirteenth method of severing obstructions: **no arising of prideful or contemptuous thoughts**.\n\nThe **Dao** is **lively and boundless**; its **ultimate essence** cannot be grasped. Severing the thirteen obstructions, the **Dao** is attained. Though called *\"attainment of the Dao,\"* in truth, there is nothing to attain. If one clings to any **fixed possession**, the **principle** remains obstructed, bound by **dharma**.\n\nThe fourteenth and final method of severing obstructions: **no arising of attachment**.\n\n**My humble reflection**: The **Dao** in humanity is **innately unobstructed**. Only when **worldly affairs and discriminating thoughts** veil it does one lose the **Way**. Thus, the **Primordial Origin** compassionately instructs the *Gate of Severing Obstructions* to the **Pure Assembly**, enumerating all obstacles, urging all to **resolutely aspire** and not be hindered by difficulties. To break free from **worldly obstructions** and transcend **dharma’s confines**, then the **Jade Emperor’s divine radiance** will reveal itself—**my wondrous essence** will shine forth, and **Yue** will see it clearly. Though so, severing these two obstructions opens the **Dao’s gate**. The **Divine Transformation** and **Mysterious Depths** are yet to be expounded in later teachings.\n\n**Chapter on the Divine Passages (34th Chapter)**:\nConcentrate the **divine essence**, clarify the **thoughts**—all **spirits** are subdued. The **heart** becomes **Primordial Void**, **inner and outer** untainted and pure, containing all without exclusion, accepting all without reservation. Do not allow **external evils** to disturb your **Supreme Dao**, drag you away from the **True Principle**, ruin your **numinous root**, or steal your **Ultimate Treasure**, lest you fall into **endless mundane existence**, trapped in the **world’s net**, assailed by **ten thousand demons**, and for **hundreds of thousands of kalpas** hear no **wondrous dharma**, while **ghosts and spirits** seize the chance to condemn you, from birth into death.\n\nThus, you must **resolutely cultivate**, safeguard the **True Principle**, and never let it be lost. As previously stated, all these obstructions must be **severed by you**. With **body pure and thoughts clear**, you transcend all **difficulties**—this is the **Dao’s Treasure**, the **pillar of upholding the Law**.\n\nLiu Haichan says: *\"The Primordial Origin teaches the method of severing obstructions; it generates **great wisdom** and cuts off the **fourteen paths of karmic inclination**.\"* What is its **ultimate fruition**?\n\nSevering obstructions and removing veils, **divine clarity** and **pure thoughts** arise. **Silently dwell** in the **Primordial Spirit** and **Mysterious Origin**, **concentrate the Primordial Spirit**, and **clarify all thoughts**—all **spirits** harmonize and **submerge**. The **heart** is like **endless void**, **inner and outer** steadfast, pure, and white. All **mundane dharmas** and **living beings** are contained without limit, embraced without exclusion.\n\nMoreover, **fix the vision and guard it firmly**, never wavering—do not let **external evils** confuse your **Supreme Rectitude** and **Great Dao**, nor drag you away from the **True Primordial Principle**, lest you ruin your **Ultimate Numinous Root**, steal your **inherent, unshareable, indestructible Treasure**, and cause you to **accumulate kalpas** in **endless mundane existence**, sinking deep into the **net of worldly dust**, with **demonic afflictions** relentlessly assaulting you. For **hundreds of thousands of kalpas**, you will be ensnared by **demonic deeds**, hearing no **Supreme True Wondrous Law**, while **ghosts and spirits** seize the opportunity to **condemn and slay** you, from birth into death.\n\nThus, you **Law Assembly** must **sincerely resolve**, **self-protect the innate True Principle**, and never let it be **lost or abandoned**. As previously stated, all **doubts and obstructions** must be **exterminated and severed**. The **fourteen obstructions**, including **external evils**, **birth and death**, and **mundane inclinations**, are all encompassed within.\n\nOnce all obstructions are **severed and cut off**, the **body attains true purity and clarity**, transcending the **three realms’ karmic cycles** and **sufferings**. This is the **method of severing obstructions**—the **Dao’s Ultimate Treasure**, the **great pillar supporting the True Law**.\n\nTemples, halls, pagodas, palaces, gates, and dwellings—without **pillars and beams**, their construction is difficult. Cultivating the **Dao** to **perfection**, entering **sainthood** and transcending **mundanity**—without **severing obstructions**, liberation is impossible. Severing all obstructions ensures **eternal freedom from ruin**, and the **True Law** flourishes.\n\nThus, the **Celestial Sovereign** regards **severing obstructions** as the **pillar upholding the Law**.\n\n**My humble reflection**: Humanity’s **inherent true nature** and **Primordial Spirit** are **pure and untainted**, **unbroken through kalpas**, naturally **serene and content**, and **never cease to be luminous**, undivided from **sainthood and truth**. If **clarity** persists without end, how could the **Jade Emperor’s divine transformation** and **wondrous light** not be **witnessed clearly**?\n\nYet, **thoughts** cling to the **heart**, perpetuating and unchanging. Those who **slightly understand the Dao** still hope for **rapid results**, so **deep-seated habits** linger, **afflictions** persist, and the **Imperial Light** remains unseen. If **true enlightenment** and **mysterious penetration** are **perfectly achieved**, the **ultimate fruit** is **unshakable**—knowing **nature and life** as **true**, recognizing **all things** as **illusionary**, one **sees the Dao** and **forgets things**, then **walks the Dao** and **forgets people**, **attains the Dao** and **forgets self**, **completes the Dao** and **forgets the heart**, and **delights in the Dao** and **forgets inclinations**.\n\nThen, **forgetting forgets to forget the true**, **affairs and principles merge**, **true and false are both abandoned**, neither clinging to **sainthood nor mundanity**, nor needing **five ranks of masters and disciples**. **Attainment without attainment**, **guardianship without clinging**, **emptiness yet not empty**, **not divine yet divine**—then **ancient habits are purified**, **accumulated karmas vanish**, **subtle defilements are extinguished**, and one **enters the Supreme**. No longer **drifting in silence** toward the **Celestial Emperor**, sharing **divine essence**; no longer **ringing the bell** of the **Dao’s natural law**, merging with **true principle**—what need is there for **three vehicles** or **all teachings**? The **most exalted in sainthood**, whose **virtues** are **unparalleled**?\n\nAll can **achieve it**—only the **purity of root and dust**, the **perfection of mysterious practice**, and the **wondrousness of effortless action** matter. **No doing, no questioning**.\n\n「The rigid and false cannot truly escape; yet the fusion is not yet complete, nor the transformation divine—still, one has not fully attained sainthood. Only those who have transcended the **Daoist** *Xuanzhong* **Earthly Immortal**, the **Buddhist** *Phosat* **Bodhisattva**, and the **Confucian** *Daxian* **Great Sage** and above can achieve this.\n\nNow, mortals seeking the **Dao/Way**, still adhere to the **Most Exalted in Sainthood** (至聖), not deeming the **Great Vehicle** (大乘) as sufficient. In the **Thirty-Fifth Chapter of Divine Powers** (神通品三十五章), you must further cultivate and revere this sacred text, as if standing before the **Celestial Emperor** (玉皇尊帝). Nurture a heart of reverence and awe, focus your contemplation on the **Emperor’s Noble Form** (尊容), and proclaim the **Emperor’s Glorious Titles** (尊號). Only then will you behold the **Compassionate Face** (慈颜), all receive the **Emperor’s Protection and Liberation** (護度), universally hear the **Wondrous Law** (妙法), and personally offer **Devoted Reverence and Sustenance** (祗奉供養), forever free from **rebirth’s cycles** (輪轉).\n\n**Eastern Hua Wood Official** (东华木公) declared: *\"The **Primordial Beginning** (元始) revealed to the multitudes the Law of Severing Obstacles (断障之法), which, being called the **Dao/Way’s Treasure** (道寶) and the **Pillar of the Law** (持法栋梁), was further demonstrated to all as the **Enduring Practice and Devotion** (持久服膺之義). You, the **Pure Assembly** (清眾), having heard the **True Teaching** (正法) today, must further uphold and revere this *Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Scripture* (《玉皇本行經》). By personally reciting this scripture, you stand near the **Jade Emperor’s Noble Sovereign** (玉皇尊帝), generating a heart of **reverence and safeguarding** (尊敬保重).\n\nKnowing the **Noble Scripture** (尊經) prevents profaning the **Dao’s Natural Law** (天道); honoring the **Scripture** (重經) prevents belittling the **Dao’s Treasure** (天寶). Eternal reverence ensures no **disrespect or negligence** (悖慢), and the **Great Dao/Way** is naturally attained.\n\nThis aligns with the *Analects* (《論語》) saying: *\"Revere the **Heavenly Mandate** (天命), and revere the words of the **Sage** (聖人).\"* Yet, to stand near the **Emperor** (是帝) is not to truly behold the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝); if one cannot yet **cross over and meet** (對越) the **Emperor**, then one cannot yet generate **true reverence** (尊重).\n\nFocusing one’s attention and contemplating the **Emperor’s Noble Form and Wondrous Aspect** (尊容妙相) is not merely an act of **imagination** (想像). It is as if the **Emperor** were truly present—then, **devotedly serving the Celestial Sovereign** (昭事上帝), one **unites in virtue with Heaven and Earth** (與天地合德) and becomes the **Most Exalted in Sainthood** (至聖).\n\nBy proclaiming and extolling the **Emperor’s Most Noble Titles** (至尊徽號), you will behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s Great Compassionate Radiance** (玉帝大慈光颜), all receiving the **Emperor’s Protection and Liberation** (護持拔度), universally hearing the **Supreme True Wondrous Law** (無上至真妙法), and personally offering **Devoted Reverence and Sustenance** (祗奉供養) to the **Emperor** (是帝) and the **Scripture** (是經), forever free from **rebirth’s cycles and decline** (輪灭轉移之失).\n\nAnother teaching says: *\"Seeing this sacred text, hearing this wondrous law, and beholding the **Emperor’s Face** (是帝颜), if one can personally and sincerely uphold and offer **reverence and sustenance** (崇奉供養), then one will forever escape the **mundane and profane** (尘凡), free from the **sufferings of rebirth and transmigration** (輪回轉生之苦).\"* A deeper interpretation suggests that the **heart is forever steadfast**, and this is even more profound.\n\n**Doubting Examination** (考疑) states: *\"Confucian texts say, the **Divine** (神) cannot be summoned by mere thought. **Daoist** scriptures say, **Divine Transformation** (神化) requires no contrivance—it follows **Nature** (自然). **Buddhist** scriptures say, if one seeks the **Tathagata** (如來) through **form** (色) or **sound** (音声), one has strayed onto the **erroneous path** (邪道) and cannot behold the **Tathagata**. Yet today it is said: focus your contemplation on the **Emperor’s Noble Form** (尊容), proclaim the **Emperor’s Titles** (尊號), and then you will behold the **Compassionate Face** (慈颜).*\n\nDoes the **Primordial Beginning’s Mysterious Ancestor** (元始玄祖) deceive us? These words are not mere **fantasy or stagnant musings** (意想思存), nor are they **trapped in sensory traces** (滞迹口耳). To **unify in virtue with Heaven** (合德於天) and **inspire divine trust in the Emperor** (孚神於帝), to **blend and forget in transformation** (浑化相忘)—thus the ancients said: *\"The **Heavenly威** (威) does not contradict the **Emperor’s Face** (玉帝颜), even at a distance of inches.\"* Through **reverent devotion and transformation** (敬恭而化), one naturally reaches the **ultimate praise**.\n\nThis is as the Confucian texts say: *\"Speak the words of **Emperor Yao** (尧), and act in the manner of **Emperor Yao**—then you are **Emperor Yao**.\"* As the **Buddhist** teachings say: *\"The **Dharmakaya** (法身) enters my **nature** (性), and my **nature** unites with the **Tathagata’s** (如來) **true principle** (真).\"* And as the **Daoist** scriptures say: *\"The **Divine** (神) merges with the **Dao/Way** (道), and the **Dao/Way** becomes one with the body.\"* Only thus can one **hear the wondrous law** (聞妙法), **offer reverence and sustenance** (奉供養), and be **forever free from rebirth’s cycles** (無輪轉).\n\nIf one merely **stores thoughts in the heart** (心存想) and **proclaims with the mouth** (口稱扬), yet cannot **submit one’s body** (皈身) or **submit one’s divine mandate** (皈神命), nor **converge in darkness with the Dao** (冥心會道), then this cannot be called **true reverence and sustenance** (真供養), and how can one **avoid rebirth’s cycles** (焉得無輪轉)?\n\nThe **uttermost perfection** (至無毁沦) and **unending steadfastness** (不迁转) prove that **contemplation, proclamation, and sustenance** (注想、稱揚、供養) transcend the **ordinary world’s understanding** (世俗之謂).\n\n**Foolish Reflection** (愚按) states: *\"All mortals possess **life and destiny** (性命) from **Heaven** (天), yet they fall into the **profane currents** (俗流) and thus are bound by **rebirth’s cycles** (輪轉). If one **masterminds the great Dao/Way** (經綸天下之大經) and **fulfills its nature** (能盡其性), then one truly **cultivates and reveres the Jade Emperor’s Scripture** (修奉玉帝經典); if one **crosses over and meets the Emperor in Heaven** (能對越在天), then it is as if one **stood near the Emperor** (即如近是帝). With **a humble and cautious heart** (小心翼翼), **devotedly serving without deviation** (祗事不違), one generates **true reverence** (生尊重心). The **body acts as Heaven’s work** (身代天工), the **mouth speaks as Heaven’s voice** (口代天言), **following Heaven without self-interest** (法天不私), and the **Emperor’s True Principle** (帝真) is **naturally present** (時御).\n\nThis is the **contemplation of the Jade Emperor’s Form** (想玉帝容), the **proclamation of the Emperor’s Titles** (稱帝號), and the **attainment of the Emperor’s Radiance** (得绪帝颜). **Virtue is singular** (德惟一), and **all actions are auspicious** (動罔不吉). **Exhausting oneself, exhausting others, exhausting all things** (盡己、盡人、盡物), **participating in the transformation and nurturing of all** (參贊化育), **submitting to destiny and sincerely surrendering** (皈命投誠), **embodying the form with utmost fidelity** (践形惟肖)—**supreme sincerity knows no cessation** (至誠無息), **eternal and boundless** (悠久無疆)—thus all receive **the Emperor’s Protection** (護度), universally hear the **Wondrous Law** (妙法), and personally offer **reverence and sustenance** (親奉供養), forever free from **rebirth’s cycles** (永無輪轉).\n\nAh! **The Dao/Way** in mortals must be **piercing and unbroken** (突不離). **The Dao/Way** has its **scriptures** (經), as **walking has its paths** (行有路). To **tread its full circuit** (践彼周行), how can one who walks the **Dao/Way** (行道者) not follow this path? **Confucius** had no **other way** (何莫由道) to deceive. The **Primordial Beginning** (元始) spoke truly: *\"The profane cannot behold the Emperor\"* (凡流不能見帝). If one **truly grasps this scripture** (果味是經), one **stands equal with the Jade Emperor** (自與玉帝齐肩).\n\nIn the **Thirty-Sixth Chapter of Divine Powers** (神通品三十六章), at that time, the **Fourfold Assembly** (四眾) heard these words and **rejoiced, leaping in delight** (歡喜躍跃), exclaiming that such had never been heard before. The **Grand Celestial Official** (天官大帝) declared: *\"At the assembly of the Jade Scripture’s Law (玉經時), the Fourfold Assembly (法會四眾) heard the **Primordial Beginning’s Daoist Ancestor** (元始道祖) expound the *Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Scripture* (《玉皇本行集經》), specifically the **Thirty-Fifth Chapter of Divine Powers in the Pure and Mysterious Celestial Palace** (□清微天宮神通品卷分已竟).*\n\nThey heard of the **Emperor’s extraordinary birth** (生長之奇异), the **accumulation of merits across countless ages** (多世之修因), the **limitless transformations** (變化之無量), the **inexhaustible virtues** (功德之難窮), the **natural divine responses** (神應之自然), and the **greatest of laws** (法之最大). The **attendants and guards, Jade Maidens** (侍衛玉女), **emanated from Heaven’s True Nature** (化自天真). The **boundaries of the sands** (沙界) and the **vast calamities** (浩劫) were all **relied upon by this scripture and law** (悉賴經法). They **understood the causes of crime and blessing** (明罪福之緣由) and **listened to the wondrous intent of severing obstacles** (聆斷障之妙旨).\n\nThe **Seventeen Great Radiant Lights** (十七大光明) have their **foundations** (洞之有基); the **countless eons of cultivating truth** (億萬劫修真) have their **key principles** (述之有要). **Taking the law as one’s own** (取法自在) makes **entering sainthood effortless** (入聖無難). They rejoiced at **escaping the mundane karmic burdens** (慶塵業之已脫) and **easily entering the Seven Realms** (幸七所之易入), all filled with **joy and delight** (悉皆歡悅喜樂), **exultant and leaping** (忻腾躍跃), **in unison praising** (同聲稱讚).\n\nThe present gathering of the **Law Assembly** (法会) is a **most auspicious and supreme opportunity** (良缘最胜), a **rare and extraordinary encounter** (奇逢非偶). This assembly, this teaching—**this is the Emperor, this is the Scripture** (此会此闻，是帝是经)—this moment, this instruction (兹时兹训) are **unprecedented since the eons** (历劫以来未曾有也).\n\nSome say, *\"Hearing the saying ‘already finished’\"* (闻是说已) refers **solely to the method of severing the battle-array** (断阵之法), which is **too restrictive**. When the **Primordial Dao Ancestor** (元始道祖) expounded the Scripture, the *Chapter on Divine Powers* (《神通品》) was **already completed** (说已竟), not something spoken after another discourse.\n\nThough divided into **three volumes and five chapters** (三卷五品), the **Divine Instruction** (慈训) was **demonstrated in accordance with its categories**, so the **Heavenly True Ones** (天真) **recited the Scripture in three volumes** (演经列三卷耳). If one were to interpret the **concluding volume’s expressions of praise** (终卷称叹) as mere **ordinary exclamations** (他叹言), it would be **incomplete understanding**.\n\nThus, *\"hearing the saying ‘already finished’\"* (闻是说已) must **comprehensively embrace the preceding discourse**. Let the **readers of the Scripture** (看经者) **examine this carefully**.\n\n**My humble observation:** The **human body’s spirit, qi, blood, and vitality** (人身精神气血) **obey the Heavenly Sovereign** (听命天君). The **wondrous mind** (妙心) is **penetrating and clear** (洞然), the **Heavenly Resonance** (天籁) **emits sound**, the **mind is serene and harmonious** (怡然理顺), the **Great Harmony** (太和) **naturally arises** (油然), hands dance, feet leap—**joy knows no bounds** (快乐无方). **Obtaining the Dao, one forgets artifice** (得道忘机), surpassing all in the world (举世莫尚).\n\nEven the **fourfold assembly of the body** (身亦有四众), upon hearing the teaching, **rejoice and leap in exultation** (欢喜踊跃), **as though they had never before experienced such wonder** (欺未曾有之义也). Yet the world is **immersed in greed and desire** (溺利欲), few **awaken to true understanding** (了悟无人). To **enter sainthood and attain Truehood** (入圣成真) is **rarely seen** (不数见耳).\n\nIf one **hears the Scripture in silent resonance** (闻经默会), the **body embodies Great Harmony** (身具太和), the **mind merges with spiritual transformation** (心融神化), then **is the Emperor’s achievement not within oneself?** (帝功不在我乎?)\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the First Volume’s Chapter Divisions**\nThe **Primordial Heavenly Venerable** (元始天尊) expounded the *Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct* (《玉皇本行集经》). The **Heavenly True Ones** (诸天真) requested an explanation of the **roots of the Emperor’s transformations** (帝化根由). Though their questions varied, they were all **posed at one time** (皆在一时), so **how did the first volume come to be divided into thirty-six chapters?** (如何首卷分三十六章?)\n\nThe Scripture was **indeed delivered in one sitting** (说经固在一时), yet **each question elicited a distinct response** (因问以答，各有不同). Later generations **failed to grasp the Scripture’s essence and intent** (不能明经旨趣), **penetrating the profound instructions of the Most Holy** (洞至圣玄训), hence the **Heavenly True Ones, Imperial Gods, and Five Elders** (诸天帝神真、五老帝君) **recorded and annotated beforehand**, while **Heavenly Yóu** (天猷) **compiled and arranged afterward**.\n\nThe **Imperial Duke of Literature** (文昌帝君) and **Heavenly Pivot Marshal** (天枢上相) **each, in their time, deliberated and corrected**, thus **designating the first section as *The First Chapter: Divine Powers of the Pure Bright Heavenly Palace*** (首分系曰《清微天宫神通品第一》), without further division, for the **Emperor’s divine powers are unparalleled** (帝神通无伦), **supreme and unexcelled** (其居无上).\n\nThe **Primordial Instruction** (元始此训) is **beyond the speech of all immortals and Buddhas** (诸仙佛不能言也). **Bo Yang of the Han-Wei era, Lü Chunyang of the Tang, Qiu Changchun of the Yuan, and Luo Pengan of the Ming** (汉魏伯阳、唐吕纯阳、元丘长春、明罗念庵) **commented on it in great detail**, dividing it into chapters with annotations. Thus, the **first volume’s *Chapter on Divine Powers*** (首卷《神通品》) **comprises thirty-six chapters** (得三十六章).\n\nThis was **not a frivolous dissection of True Speech** (非轻析真语), but rather **a structured division** (故使支分), **aligned with the thirty-six heavens** (从三十六天之义以立章). Moreover, **each division carries profound intent** (截处有旨), the **meanings flow in continuity** (意相统承), **without scattering or dispersing**.\n\nIf the **reciter or observer** (观诵者) **clears the mind and purges distractions** (澄心涤虑), **embodying the Most Holy’s intent in expounding the Scripture** (以体至圣说经之意) and the **uppermost True Ones’ purpose in dividing the chapters** (上真分章之趣), **striving to harmonize one’s spirit with the Holy True Ones** (务使神与圣真相孚), then **the Scripture’s vital essence will flow uninterrupted** (会经血脉贯串). Then, **what division remains among the thirty-six chapters?** (则三十六章又何分?) **How could the Scripture’s intent not be attained?** (说经之旨又岂不可得哉?)\n\nYet **many are mired in the letter** (泥文者多), **few attain silent comprehension** (默识不厌者寡). Some **deem the Scripture useless** (或以经为无益), others **treasure a single phrase as extraordinary** (或得一句以为奇), still others **fixate on a single character as flaw** (或执一字以为病). They **distinguish between the *Lingbao* and *Gaoshang* schools** (别灵宝、高上之名), **lacking the mind to listen to the divine resonance’s marvel** (无心聆神会之妙), thus **failing to awaken to the Dao through the Scripture**, instead **becoming ensnared by textual dogmatism** (反为文字障执), **deepening confusion** (又惑之甚者也).\n\nAlas! **All Scriptures contain supreme utterances** (诸经至语), **each a seal of the heart** (皆为心印). **Through the text, the Dao is glimpsed** (因文见道); **obtaining the Dao, one transcends words** (得道忘言). The **mysterious celestial treatises** (玄穹秘论) are **already the inherent threads of my own being** (悉我固有经纶). **Why doubt its accessibility**, to the point of **lightly slandering it?** (又何疑其难入，至於轻谤) **How fortunate for those who attain even a single insight!** (一得辄幸哉?)\n\n**These concluding remarks** (赘此首末) are **a warning to scholars** (学者戒之).\n\n---\n**The Imperial Scripture’s Annotated Commentary, Volume Four**\n**Conclusion of the First Volume’s Thirty-Six Chapters**\n**Imperial Scripture’s Compiled Commentary, Volume Five**\n\nThe **Grandmaster of the Dao** (嗣汉五十代天师), the **Great

Teachings’** (三教) **saints and true persons** (圣真) are all beyond comparison—\nthus, it is placed first, revealing the **divine transformation** (神化) of this **true Scripture** (真经).\nThis **chapter** (品) first enumerates the **Scripture of Divine Spells** (《神咒品》),\nfor it contains **secret laws** (秘法语) within the Scripture.\nThose who can **transcend mortals and record immortals** (度人录仙),\n**control the stars** (制星), **subdue demons** (制魔), **command water** (制水),\n**pacify the five directions** (镇五方), **benefit the dharma realm** (济法界),\nare called **divine spells** (神咒).\nIf one possesses **divine powers** (神通) yet the **Scripture’s secret words** (法语秘文) remain unmanifested,\nthen its benefit is yet to be realized—\nthus, it follows the **Scripture of Divine Powers** (神通) as the second chapter.\n\n**Chapter One of the Scripture of Divine Spells** (神咒品第二)\n**Chapter One of the Scripture of Divine Spells** (神咒品第一章):\n*\"At that time*, the **Primordial Sovereign of Heaven and Earth** (天地始祖),\nthe **Five Old Emperors of the Five Directions** (五老上帝),\nprostrated themselves with long kneeling and respectfully addressed the **Heavenly Venerable** (天尊):\n*'We humbly hear* that the **Highest Celestial Jade Emperor** (高上玉皇),\nout of **compassionate concern** (慈念) for the **mortal masses** (苍生),\nuniversally emits **limitless true divine light** (无量真光),\nilluminating the **three-thousand great-thousand worlds** (三千大千),\nall **heavens and earths** (诸天诸地), and the **entire dharma realm** (一切法界).\nThe **six classes of mortals** (六凡)—heavens, humans, demons, hells,\nhungry ghosts, and beasts—\nas well as the **supreme vehicle** (至最上一乘) and the **four grades of lesser vehicles** (上、中、下乘四等),\nthe **four saints** (四圣)—**immortals and true persons** (仙真), **Buddhas** (佛), **celestial beings** (神), and **virtuous scholars** (志士)—\nall universally benefit from the **compassionate radiance of the Dao** (大道慈光), receiving its **protection** (荫庇).\n\n*We humbly reflect*: though mortals are **short-lived** (不寿),\ntheir **worldly existence is fleeting** (世景短促),\nand the **dharma realm’s karmic cycle** (法界劫运) is nearing its end—\nthe **true path of immortals and sages** (仙真正道) should now be **propagated** (传行).\nTo **deliver countless beings** (济亿兆之民),\ngranting those who **aspire to immortality and Dao cultivation** (希仙修真之子)\na **chance to transcend** (脱之期),\nso they may **lightly ascend** (轻身冲举),\nand ensuring that the **mortal masses of the final age** (末代烝民) suffer no **untimely death** (夭折),\nall attaining **longevity and respect** (寿考).\n\n*For mortals in this world*, life has a **fixed measure** (定数),\nand the **saints of the Three Teachings** (三教圣人) all **shed their mortal coils** (蜕骨).\n**Master Yan Hui**, the **great sage** (大贤),\n**passed away at thirty-two** (三十二岁而卒).\nThough the **Imperial Scripture** (《皇经》) may offer **benefits** (利益),\nhow could it **defy the natural order** (违大造之数) and grant **eternal life** (长生)?\nThis is not so.\nThe **body may die** (身可死),\nyet the **fundamental life principle** (生理) does not perish.\nIf one **does not comprehend the Dao** (道理不明),\nthough they **linger in this world** (生世上),\ntheir **heart is already dead** (其心已死),\n**clutching at a borrowed existence** (偷生苟免)—\nwhat is such life worth calling **longevity** (寿)?\nBut if one **grasp the Dao** (明了道理),\n**penetrates its truth** (悟彻行成),\nand **returns to the void** (还虚脱化),\nthen even **dying in the evening after hearing it in the morning** (朝闻夕死)\nleaves no **regret** (遗恨),\nfor this is **true longevity** (长生).\nThus, the *Dao De Jing* (《道德经》) says:\n*'To die yet not perish is longevity'* (死而不亡者寿).\n**Confucius** (孔子) says:\n*'Human life is upright'* (人之生也直).\nAnd again:\n*'The virtuous live long'* (仁者寿).\nThe **Buddhist Scriptures** (释经) say:\n*'If one attains **nirvana** (涅盘), they see the **Tathagata** (如来),\nthis is called the **unbreakable adamantine body** (金刚不坏).*\n\nThe **supreme masters of the Three Teachings** (三教至人)\ndo not regard **death as death** (不以死为死),\nbut **ignorance of the Dao as death** (以不明道为死);\nnor do they consider **life as life** (不以生为生),\nbut **realization of the Dao as life** (以了道为生).\nThough **natural fate** (造化之数) decrees that **no one escapes birth and death** (生死难逃),\nit **binds ordinary people** (可拘常人)\nyet **cannot constrain the saints** (而不可拘圣人).\n\nThe *Scripture of the Highest Celestial Jade Emperor* (《玉皇尊经》),\noriginating from **Primordial Beginning** (元始),\nis the **supreme vehicle’s wondrous law** (最上一乘妙法),\nthe **true essence of the Three Teachings** (三教之真宗),\nthe **mystic key of all phenomena** (万法之玄诀),\nthe **compassionate vessel of the dharma realm** (法界之慈航),\nthe **critical pass of birth and death** (生死之要关),\nthe **secret meaning of arising, abiding, perishing, and voidness** (成住坏空之秘旨),\nthe **mechanism of the tilted kalpa** (倾劫之机括),\nthe **path to liberation and enlightenment** (超证坦途),\nand the **wondrous chapter for worldly salvation** (度世妙品).\nIt is the **bridge across the karmic bonds and sins** (解结拔罪之津梁).\n\nIf the **Supreme Venerable** (至尊) **compassionately expounds** (慈演) this Scripture,\nthe **mortal masses** (烝民) will **once receive the saintly grace** (一蒙圣恩),\n**inheriting the power of divine light** (承神光力),\nall **returning to the true path** (皈依正法),\nnot straying into **erroneous ways** (不落邪径),\n**unshamed before birth and death** (生死无愧),\nand **granting longevity to those with short lives** (能令短命众生而得长寿).\nSuch is the **divine efficacy** (神功) of this Scripture.\n\n**Protective resonance** (荫音), **imprint of truth** (印).\n**Chong** (烝) is the same as **zheng** (蒸).\n\nThe **Final Age of the Ending Kalpa**\n\n**Chapter Two: The Divine Incantations**\n\nFrom ancient times, the *Elemental Origin: Mystic Cavern Treasure Scripture—The Scarlet Book of Jade Pages True Texts* emerged before the Elemental Origin, within the void, when heaven and earth had no roots, the sun and moon no radiance, in profound obscurity, without ancestor or lineage, without *qi* or form, without hue or name, without shape or thread, without sound or voice. In chaotic non-being, the numinous texts were dimly inscribed, neither clear nor obscure, appearing and vanishing. The numinous diagrams unfolded, the arcane symbols shifted, the refined *qi* ascended into the void, riding the mechanism of cosmic correspondence.\n\nThus did the **True Edicts of the Jade Emperor**, the **Secret Seals of the Treasure Scripture**, and the **Inconceivable Supreme Divine Incantations** take form.\n\nThe **Five Elderly Deities**, primordial ancestors of heaven and earth, spoke of the **True Dao of the Jade Emperor’s Scripture**, which could grant longevity to the mortal masses of the Final Age. How did such great efficacy arise?\n\nFrom ancient times, the *Elemental Origin: Mystic Cavern Treasure Scripture—The Great Scarlet Celestial Book* and its **Jade-Lantern Jade Pages True Texts** emerged before the establishment of the *dharma*-realm, before the Elemental Origin’s primordial beginning, within the boundless void. Before the Two Principles had divided, before the Supreme Ultimate’s boundlessness, when heaven and earth lacked foundation, when yin and yang, water and fire had not yet conceived, before the sun and moon shone—amidst boundless murk, where distinctions were nonexistent, only profound obscurity remained.\n\nBefore the Ten Thousand Phenomena arose, who could claim precedence? No trace of cosmic transformation was visible—no ancestor, no lineage. In the boundless void, no *qi* was seen, no form existed, no color could be grasped, no name could be spoken, no shadow or outline remained, no echo or resonance endured. Vast and formless, where could sound or voice be found? In utter silence, the *Elemental Origin: Mystic Cavern Treasure Scripture—Scarlet Book of Jade Pages*’ true texts glimmered—dim yet not invisible, faint yet not entirely obscure, appearing and vanishing, neither purely existent nor purely nonexistent, neither having nor lacking, having yet not permanently having, lacking yet not permanently lacking.\n\nThen the **Elemental Origin’s numinous diagrams** unfolded, the **Arcane Origin’s wondrous transformations** manifested, the **refined *dharma*-breath** ascended through the void, riding the **celestial mechanism**, responding to the auspicious convergence of heaven and humanity. The **Jade Emperor’s Sacred Decrees**, the **Treasure Scripture’s Secret Celestial Seals**, and the **Inconceivable Supreme Divine Incantations**—their boundless, unfathomable virtues thus revealed themselves in hidden forms, and the **wondrous *dharma* endured**.\n\nThe **Scarlet Book**, the **Jade Emperor’s True Scripture**, the **Texts of Marvelous Existence**, were all formed from the primordial *dharma*-breath of the celestial realms, their characters vast—one *zhang* in length—radiant crimson, the **Great Scarlet Gold Scriptures of the Azure Heaven**. Above the Nine Heavens lay the **Jade-Lantern Jade Pages** of the *Elemental Origin: Mystic Cavern Treasure Scripture*. With **precious clouds and jade moisture**, they were thus called the *Jade Pages*.\n\nThey emerged before the Elemental Origin, before heaven and earth’s primordial dawn—not before the Elemental Origin Lord. Before heaven and earth took root—not that heaven and earth lacked the power of transformation—they arose from the void. The **Elemental Origin’s true texts** existed before the Three Thousand Great Realms were established, before the vast kalpas, hence no trace of heaven and earth’s initial division was seen. They appeared and vanished, existing yet indefinable in form, vanishing yet never entirely extinguished in truth.\n\nThe **Jade Emperor’s True Words**, the **Imperial Scripture’s Marvelous Canon**, compassionately saved all without end, enduring through the vast kalpas, permeating the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds yet never exhausted. The celestial realms revered them, the Three Teachings followed them—**the decrees of the tilted kalpa’s *dharma*-realm**.\n\nThe **Secret Seals of the Treasure Scripture**, the **Celestial Cloud Scriptures**, were not easily heard or seen, inconceivable, beyond thought or speech, beyond measure. Thus they endured.\n\nThe **True Texts of the Jade Scripture** existed before the vast kalpas—not newly arising today, but awaiting the auspicious convergence of mechanism and response. The **Dao** permeated the boundless void—what form did it take? Who could perceive it? Though it existed, none knew its existence. Now, as the **True Path should be practiced**, the numinous texts shine forth in hidden splendor, their divine efficacy radiant and manifest.\n\nThus it is said: *They endure*.\n\nThe **True Scripture’s wondrous *dharma*** manifests when the mechanism converges and the response aligns—**a rare and fortunate time**. Those present here, would they dare to presume upon themselves and not seek the *dharma*’s instruction?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three: The Divine Incantations**\n\nThus did heaven and earth obtain it and divide, the Three Luminaries obtain it and shine. The numinous texts flourished, illuminating the Mystic Cavern, emanating from the **First Azure Heaven**, their hues undefinable, their patterns winding, difficult to trace.\n\nThe **Elemental Origin** refined them in the **Mystic Yang Hall**, tempered them in the **Flowing Fire Courtyard**, their pristine sounds preceding the true texts, their radiance gleaming—**Mystic Yang’s *qi* was crimson**, hence the name *Scarlet Book*.\n\nWhen the numinous diagrams blazed, the Five Emperors paid homage to the True One, soaring through the void, circling the Upper Palaces, burning incense and scattering flowers, reciting the sacred verses. At that time, the heavens displayed twelve arcane omens, the earth manifested twenty-four responses, celebrating the Nine Heavens’ numinous mysteries, praising the Three Heavens’ precious brilliance. The **divine winds blew**, the **Imperial Dao flourished**.\n\nThe **Elemental Origin** issued the decree, the **Supreme True One** took up the brush, the **Jade Consort** swept the table, casting gold into tablets, carving jade into scriptures. The Five Elders recorded them, hidden in the **Nine Heavens’ Mystic Capital Hall**. The **Jade Maidens** attended to the incense, the **Great Hua** held the towels, the **Golden Boys** stood guard, the **Jade Steps** faced the hall. The **Nine Heavens’ Jade Scriptures** were beyond the hearing of ghosts and spirits.\n\nOnly the **True Texts of the Jade Scripture** and the **Secret Seals of the Treasure Scripture** endured thus.\n\nTherefore, the **Supreme Ultimate gave birth to the Two Principles**—the clear ascending as *Qian*, the turbid congealing as *Kun*—and heaven and earth obtained them and divided. The **Sun shone**, the **Moon displayed its luster**, the **stars arrayed themselves**, and the Three Luminaries obtained them and radiated light.\n\nThe **True Scriptures of the Sacred Texts** rise in lush splendor, their auspicious *qi* and refined essence radiant, piercing the **Upper Purity Realm** with boundless luminosity. They emanate from the **Most High Primordial Heaven**, their hue unbound by fixed direction or place.\n\nThe radiance of these Sacred Texts spreads in intricate, unfathomable brilliance, their splendor vast and winding, beyond measure or scrutiny. The **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** refined these True Texts within the **Cavernous Yang Triple Mystery Hall**, smelting this Scripture in the **Flowing Fire Great Brahman Court**, their pristine essence shining boundless. Their **Great True and Marvelous Texts** gleam with resplendent effulgence, their luminosity pure and ascending.\n\nThe **Cavernous Yang** refined *qi* overflows with crimson radiance, utterly vermilion—thus named the **Crimson Scripture**. The **Divine Movement of Mystic Diagrams** shines forth in splendor, and the **Five Emperors** ascended to the Primordial Court. The **Most True** rode celestial clouds, traversing the void, circling and paying homage to the **Supreme Celestial Palace**, burning the **Natural True Incense of Purity**, scattering heavenly flowers, and chanting the **Sacred Texts of Treasure Chapters** from their mouths.\n\nAt that time, Heaven did not hoard its Dao—**the Primordial Star** presented its omens, and Heaven revealed the **Twelve Mystic Auspices**; Earth did not conceal its treasures—**the Twenty-Four Breaths** manifested their pure signs, and Earth emitted the **Twenty-Four Responses**. Above, the **Nine Heavens’ Sacred Texts** were celebrated for their profound intent, and the **Three Heavens’ Treasure Chapters** were extolled in brilliance, their **Illuminating Marvelous Canons** spreading divine teachings far and wide.\n\nWhen the **mechanism of salvation** was set in motion, the **Royal Dao flourished universally**, and the **Great Law benefited all**. The **Primordial Beginning** ascended the seat and bestowed command; the **Supreme True Immortal** took up the brush to inscribe, while the **Jade Maiden Sacred Consorts** swept the sacred platform. They cast **indestructible golden light** as **Mystic Strategies of Secret Tablets**, and carved **emerald-green mist** as **Crimson Scriptures**. The **Five Directions’ Five Spirits and Five Elders** oversaw their transmission, concealing them in the **Nine Heavens’ Most Sacred Mystic Capital Hall**. The **Jade Maidens** attended to the **Celestial Incense**, the **Great Hua True Person** held the **Mystic Towels**, the **Golden Boys** stood guard beside the **Jade Stairs**, and the **Jade Steps** faced the hall. The **Nine Heavens’ Jade Characters of Crimson Scripture**—unheard by all ghosts and spirits.\n\nOnly after Heaven and Earth came into being did **texts** emerge, transmitting the **Scriptures**. Now, when the **Imperial Scripture** is preserved, Heaven and Earth are divided. Men hearing this often doubt and fail to comprehend.\n\nFor the **Dao’s natural unfolding**, following its ceaseless course, becomes the **True Text**; the **Dao’s unbroken essence** becomes the **True Scripture**. Before the **Great Cataclysm**, the **Imperial Scripture’s principle** already existed. The **True Texts** have no characters; their **marvelous transformations** are inexhaustible. Thus, Heaven and Earth were divided from this point, and the **Three Luminaries** began to shine.\n\nThis is the **true reality**—what is there to doubt? The **text’s structure** is intricate. Those who use **characters as supporting strokes** are mistaken. Those who interpret **鲜 (xiān)** as **解 (jiě, \"to explain\")** are mistaken. Those who read it as **巽 (xùn, \"gentle\")** or **信 (xìn, \"faith\")** are mistaken. The **Mystic Scripture** has no form—why speak of **golden tablets**? The **Mystic Light’s marvelous symbols** endure beyond eons, hence **golden tablets and jade scriptures**. The **Mystic Text’s luminous auspices** are resplendent and dignified, hence **jade scriptures**. Ghosts and spirits cannot hear them.\n\nThe **Imperial Scripture’s** profound secrecy—ghosts and spirits do not recognize it, nor can ordinary hearing perceive it. Only those with **divine hearing** or **extraordinary hearing** may know it.\n\n---\n**Divine Incantations: Four Chapters**\n\nThus, Heaven treasures it to attain **purity**, Earth conceals it to attain **tranquility**, the **Five Emperors** wield it to attain **spiritual efficacy**, the **Three Luminaries** ride it to attain **elevated brilliance**, the **Supreme Sage** upholds it to attain **divine transcendence**, the **High Spirits** revere it to attain **True Sagacity**, the **Five Sacred Peaks** follow it to attain **stability**, and the **Son of Heaven** obtains it to attain **governance**. States rely on it to attain **peace**.\n\nThis is the **marvelous virtue of the Sacred Treasure**—the **Mystic Root of Heaven and Earth**. Its **mighty and boundless efficacy** benefits all without end, its **vast transformations** being the **source of divine illumination**. Its measure is unfathomable, towering in the **Great Void**.\n\nAt that time, the **Primordial Beginning** renewed the **Chaotic Cycle**, the **Mystic Symbols** unfolded, the **Sacred Texts** flourished in splendor, their divine manifestations marking the **Five Directions**, dividing Heaven and Earth, and enlightening all **lawful beings and categories**. This **Triple Mystery True Root Treasure**—may its **august teachings** be briefly unveiled in the **Sacred Repository**?\n\n*—\"加\" (jiā) means \"to benefit.\"*\n\nThe **Nine Heavens’ Jade Scripture Imperial Canon**—unheard by ghosts and spirits. The **Marvelous Law** is so difficult to hear that Heaven is exalted above, treasuring this **True Scripture** to attain **constant purity**. Earth is positioned below, guarding this **True Scripture** to attain **constant tranquility**. The **Five Directions’ Five Emperors** wield this **Secret Text** to achieve **spiritual efficacy** and become the **Five Spirits**. The **Sun, Moon, and Stars—Three Luminaries** ride this **True Scripture’s Marvelous Law**, elevating their suspended forms and shining brilliance. The **Supreme Sage and Perfected Ones** uphold this **True Scripture**, ascending to **incomprehensible sagacity and divine transcendence**. The **Divine Department** reveres this **True Scripture**, attaining the **position of True Sagacity**. The **Five Sacred Peaks and Holy Mountains**, through the power of this **True Scripture**, remain unshaken and attain **stability**. The **Son of Heaven**, ruling under Heaven, obtains this **Marvelous Law** to achieve **peaceful governance** across the **Four Seas**. States and dynasties rely on this **True Scripture** to ensure **political harmony and stability**.\n\nThis is the **marvelous virtue of the Sacred Treasure True Root**—the **True Root and Mystic Foundation of Heaven and Earth**. Its **heavenly威灵 (wēilíng, \"awe and efficacy\")** is vast and boundless, encompassing all **lawful realms**, benefiting all without measure. Its **vast transformations** are boundless and level, their functions formless yet without limit—truly the **infinite, immeasurable divine transformation**, the **True Root of divine illumination**, whose efficacy cannot be fathomed or recognized.\n\nWithout form or root, it towers beyond compare in the **Great Void**. At that time, the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** renewed the **Great Chaos Cycle**, the **Mystic Light’s marvelous symbols** unfolded, the **Sacred Texts** flourished in luminous splendor, their **divine manifestations** marking the **Five Directions**, dividing **Upper Heaven and Lower Earth**, and enlightening all **lawful beings and categories**. This **Triple Mystery True Root Sacred Treasure**—may its **august teachings** be briefly revealed in the **Sacred Repository**, unfolding the **Supreme True Root’s** divine essence?\n\n「披，一作披阅。 *The Imperial Scriptures of the Daoists*, in their original intent for cultivating and verifying the ranks of immortals, do not speak of harmonizing governance and achieving universal peace.\n\nYet here it says that the **Son of Heaven** attains governance through it, and the **national destiny** relies upon it for universal harmony—why so? It is because **Dao transformation** is complete, thus bringing governance and peace. When one awakens to the **True Root**, comprehending the **Great Dao**, then there is no need for speech to be believed, no need for action to effect change, nor for effort to achieve results. **Virtue** is vast, **transformation divine**, benefiting eternally without bound.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Governance is the harmonization of governance and peace.\"*\n\n**Mysterious virtue** is inherently without acquisition, unseen in giving or receiving, yet naturally its efficacy and transformation are boundless—hence, **mysterious virtue**.\n\nAs for the **Primordial Root**, all roots have form; yet **Dao** generates Heaven and Earth, though it encompasses the **Boundless**, the **Great Ultimate** gives rise to the diagram of the **Two Principles**, and the **Great Ultimate** itself is formless.\n\n**The True** is that which cannot be seen, cannot be spoken of, and cannot be depicted in diagrams—these are merely **illustrative symbols** to guide the people. What **real form** does Heaven and Earth’s Root possess? Though no real form exists, its **eternal cyclic efficacy** is endless—hence the term **Primordial Root**.\n\n**Awe-inspiring and numinous**, even the **saints of the Three Teachings** dare not slight it; its **marvelous transformation** is boundless—thus **Awe-inspiring and numinous**.\n\n**The True Root of divine illumination** is the **doctrine of all sages**. It is also said: *\"From here, ten thousand gods and sages emerge.\"*\n\n**The Great Void**—its beginning is unseen, its end is unseen; it is hazy and cannot be grasped as a form—hence **The Great Void**.\n\n*Revolutionizing the Cycle*—some say it means \"revolutionizing the cycle at its end,\" but that is incorrect. This Scripture precedes the Great Cataclysm (*Hàojiè*), thus it revolutionizes the **Great Chaos Cycle**.\n\n**Divine manifestations** in the **Five Directions**—originally, **Chaos Undivided** was formless; yet when **Directional positions** are distinguished and **internal and external** are separated, it is truly the **marvelous Dao transformation**—hence, **Divine manifestations in the Five Directions**.\n\n**Chapter on Divine Spells**—sixth in number. Now, the **Imperial Dao** spreads forth and reaches all, its blessings extending to the **Ten Directions**.\n\nGazing upward upon the **cataclysmic cycles** and the **Dao’s winds**, the **True Wind** should be promoted.\n\nThe **subject’s heart** truly desires to make the **Sacred Repository’s** blessings cover the **Eight Extremities**, its **fragrant winds** scatter across the **Lantern Grove**—that the **barren branches** may aspire to the **luxuriant warmth** of **Summer’s Radiance**, and that the **corrupted remains** may receive the **nourishing essence** of the **True Scriptures**.\n\n*The Scripture of Illuminating the True* contains **precepts**; now they should be implemented.\n\nGazing upward to the **Primordial Benevolence**, extending sincerest supplication below, the **subject humbly prays** for mercy and compassion, that the **Heavenly Sovereign** may condescend to pity the **people of the world**.\n\nMay this **Scripture of the *Lingbao Jade Slips*—the *True Texts*** be granted to the unworthy for brief revelation, and taught to those who have not yet heard?\n\nThe **Treasure of the Primordial Root**—may it be briefly unfolded in the **Sacred Repository**.\n\nWith the **Great Dao** now fully expounded and reaching all, **benevolent blessings** permeate the **Four Cardinal and Four Diagonal Directions**, from the **Upper Extremity to the Lower Extremity**, benefiting the **Ten Directions**.\n\nGazing upward upon the **cataclysmic cycles** and the **Dao’s winds**, the **True Wind** should be promoted.\n\nThe **subject’s heart** truly desires that the **Sacred Repository’s** blessings cover all **worlds within the Ten Directions**, extending to the **Eight Extremities**—that the **fragrant winds of Dao** may scatter across the **Lantern Grove** and the **Jade Enclosure**, their blessings nourishing all.\n\nThose in the world who are **mired in stagnation**, **heterodox beings** who cling to **side paths**, **demons of Heaven** and **external heresies**, both **sentient and insentient**—all who have not heard the **True Dao**—shall receive salvation through the **True Scripture**.\n\nLike the **barren branches** devoid of life’s intent, may they aspire to the **gentle warmth** that permeates **Summer’s Radiance**, reviving their withered state and flourishing anew. May the **corrupted remains**—those who, though alive, are as dead in ignorance of the **True Dao**—upon hearing the **True Scripture**, transcend and be reborn, their **marrow and bones renewed**.\n\nThe **nourishing essence of the Sacred Repository**—this is the **dew of enlightenment**.\n\n**Illuminating the True**—the **Jade Emperor’s** clear decrees to all **True Ones**.\n\n**Sincere supplication**—utterly devoting the **crimson heart**, humbly beseeching the **Supreme Sage**.\n\n**People of the world**—those with **dark hair and yellow skin**, aged to **hoary white**, ever-changing yet without constancy—hence **people of the world**.\n\nIt is also said: *\"The people born under the **Azure Sky**.\"* It is also said: *\"**People of the world**—the multitude.\"*\n\n**Sacred Repository**, **Jade Slips**, **True Texts**—all explained as before.\n\n*Granted revelation and teaching*—praying that the **Heavenly Sovereign** may transmit this Scripture and instruct all **gods, humans, ghosts, and beings** in the **Dharma Realm**, thereby saving even those who have not yet heard of it.\n\nIs it possible to be granted revelation and teaching to those who have not yet heard? This is but **modest doubt**, not daring to assert certainty, lest the **Supreme Sovereign’s** wondrous teachings be difficult to transmit. Hence, the subject first **humble beseeches**, and also employs **hesitant phrasing** to show the **urgency of the plea** and the **depth of reverence**.\n\n**Chapter on Divine Spells**—sixth in number. At this time, the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** reclined upon the **Celestial Table**, raised in **august dignity**, his **True Essence** distant yet luminous. Observing that the hour had come, he **universally convened** all **True Saints and Sages** to deliberate upon **Yin and Yang**, to calculate the **cycles of cataclysms**, to shift the **Celestial Pivot** at the **Yellow River’s source**, to **register the degrees of Heaven**, to **select worthy souls**, to **point and pluck** from the **Great Formlessness**, to **summon** the **Nine Mysteries**;\n\nHis **thoughts** opened the **ears of the ignorant**, yet the **obstructed voices** of those seeking the **True Path** were as if sealed by **barriers of sound**.\n\nAt that time, the **Five Elderly Sovereigns** raised questions without end. After much time, the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** finally **lowered his gaze** in solemn contemplation, and with a **deep sigh**, declared: *\"How profound and subtle! Your inquiry now—is it not excellent?\"*\n\nThis is the **Primordial Root of the Sacred Repository**, the **True Texts of Natural Void**, giving birth to Heaven and Earth, **enlightening the divine**, and **bestowing blessings** upon the **Five Sacred Peaks**. It **settles the nation** and **brings prosperity to the people**.\n\nThe **Sacred Treasure of Mysterious Profundity** stands supreme among all things—Heaven’s revelations manifest in wondrous omens, and divine responses arise spontaneously.\n\nThe *Sacred Treasure True Texts* should be transmitted to those yet unenlightened.\n\nAt that time, the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** stroked the **Jade Few** (a seat of transcendent transformation, not a mundane table) and ascended his **Treasure Seat**, his **Dao-body** towering in majestic stillness, lofty yet unyielding. In profound concentration, he silently unfolded boundless wisdom, his gaze piercing past, present, and future, discerning the appointed hour for **enlightenment and liberation**. Thus, he gathered all **Six Conditions** and **Ten Directions**, where all **Dharma-realms** converged in auspicious harmony. In this **Great Assembly of the True Saints**, the **Primordial Roots of Yin-Yang** were established, the **cycles of birth and transformation**—great and small, eons and cosmic turns—were calculated, the **Water Emperor of the Yellow River’s source** was realigned, the **celestial degrees** were verified and recorded, and **worthy souls of cultivated merit** were selected. With a gesture, he pointed to the **Ultimate Void**, and with a resonant chant, he intoned the **Nine Mysterious Chapters**.\n\nYet though the **Five Elderly Sovereigns**, the **Primordial Ancestors of Heaven and Earth**, pleaded with earnest supplication for the transmission of the **True Path**, their voices seemed sealed by barriers—**obstructed from the Dao**, their way to enlightenment blocked.\n\nThen, the **Five Elderly Sovereigns** pressed their inquiries without cease. After much time, the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** finally opened his **compassionate countenance**, his **sacred gaze** descending like a beacon. With a deep sigh, he declared: *\"How profound and wondrous! How deep and boundless! Your questions now—are they not excellent?\"*\n\nThis is the **Primordial Root of the Sacred Treasure**, the **True Texts of Void and Spontaneous Transformation**, giving rise to **Heaven’s Yang (Qian)** and establishing **Earth’s Yin (Kun)**, enlightening all **saints and divine beings** across every world. It **settles the Five Sacred Peaks**—**East Tai, South Huo (also called Heng), West Hua, North Heng, and Central Song**—bringing stability to successive ages and prosperity to all beings of the **Dharma-realm**.\n\nThe **Sacred Treasure’s** mysteries are most exalted among all things. Heaven manifests wondrous signs, Earth bears auspicious portents, and all spirits respond in natural accord.\n\n---\n*Annotations (as per guidelines, though suppressed in output):*\n- **玉几 (Jade Few)** – Transcendent seat (not literal furniture).\n- **高抗 (High Antagonism)** – \"Lofty yet unyielding\" (not combative).\n- **遐照 (Distant Illumination)** – \"Piercing past/present/future.\"\n- **六缘 (Six Conditions)** – Six senses/interactions (Buddhist/Daoist cosmology).\n- **九玄 (Nine Mysteries)** – Sometimes rendered as *Ninefold Recondite* or *Ninefold Profound*.\n- **盼訾 (Swelling Gaze)** – \"Descending light of the eyes\" (ritualistic term).\n\nThe **Primordial Most Sacred**—how does He deem the **Five Elders of Heaven and Earth’s** inquiry as *shàn* (善)? When one knows the **True Scripture’s** benefits and the timing of its fruition, its wisdom penetrates deeply and subtly, hence it is called *shàn*.\n\nHe opens the **Divine Illumination**, and the **Way** gives birth to all **Immortal Gods, Buddhas, and Spirits**. The rest is explained earlier.\n\n*Zè* (眦) is pronounced *zǐ* (子) or *zī* (姿).\n\n---\n**Chapter on Divine Incantations (Seven Sections)**\n\nNow, the **Three Celestial Cycles** have completed their course, the **Six Heavenly Dao** has unfolded, and **miscellaneous teachings** have been revealed. There will be **thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao** to dispel the doubts of those who seek.\n\nWhen this **Law’s** operation is fulfilled—after the **Three Dragons** (the three *yugas* of the *Lunhan* era) and in the year *Gēngzǐ*—**heterodox qi** will universally dissipate. The **Celestial Assemblies** will rejoice, and **Our True Dao** will then prevail.\n\nFor now, it may be entrusted to you. It shall be recorded in the **Upper Hall**, yet it cannot yet be practiced in the **Lower World**.\n\nThe **Mystic Precepts** are forbidden—do not transmit them recklessly.\n\nYou may personally go to the **Numinous Capital’s Purple Micro Palace**, listen to the **Celestial Voice** in the **Golden Decree**, and observe the **bowing and rising** before the **Divine Kings**. Only then will you be granted to receive the **Celestial Texts**, to govern the **Primordial Heaven’s** hosts.\n\n*Zhěng* (整) is pronounced *lì* (立). This is a filler character, not correct.\n\n---\nIf the **True Scripture** is transmitted, **Heaven’s Mystic Portents** will manifest, and **Numinous Responses** will arise naturally. What is the time now?\n\nThe **Three Qi** of the **Crimson Heaven** will realign the **Celestial Cycles**, and the **Six Sixes** of the **Heavens** will simultaneously unfold the **Dao**.\n\nThrough **miscellaneous minor teachings**, the **enlightenment and cultivation** will be revealed, with **thirty-six thousand kinds of doctrines** to clarify the hearts of those who seek the **Way**.\n\nWhen this **Law’s** transformation is complete—after the **Three Dragons** (the three *yugas* of the *Lunhan* era) and in the year *Gēngzǐ*, during the **Zhēnyuán Assembly Cycle**—**heterodox qi** will universally dissipate, and the **Celestial Assemblies** will rejoice in the **Night of the Celestial Gathering**. Then, **Our True Dao’s** orthodox **Law** will prevail.\n\nFor now, it may provisionally be entrusted to you. It shall be recorded in the **Upper Mystic Heaven’s Hall**, yet it cannot yet be practiced in the **Lower Dusty World**.\n\nThe **Mystic Precepts of Heaven’s Law** are strictly forbidden—do not transmit them lightly.\n\nYou may personally go to the **Most Numinous Mystic Capital’s Purple Micro Palace**, listen to the **Celestial Voice**, and receive the **Golden Decree’s** solemn edicts. Observe the **bowing and rising** before the **Immortal Gods and Heavenly Kings, Marshals and Historians**, knowing the **Law’s** noble benefits.\n\nOnly then will you be granted to receive the **True Scripture’s Celestial Texts**, to govern the **Primordial Sovereign’s** harmonization of all **Heavens**.\n\nThe Three Heavens—those of **Qing** (Azure), **Chi** (Vermilion), and **Yu** (Jade) **Qi**—are the realms of the three **Qi** essences.\nThe Six Heavens encompass **desire**, **form**, **formless**, **light dust**, **fine dust**, **light defilement**, and **fine defilement**, among others.\n\nThe **Heavenly Emperors and Divine Humans** expound the **Great**, **Middle**, and **Lesser Vehicles** of **Dao** in their teachings, each according to their rank in **Dao** practice. They deliver varied **small methods** and guide beings through transformation.\n\nThere are **thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao**. Within the human body, there are **thirty-six thousand divine qi**, varying in clarity, illumination, and strength. Some hold **true faith**, while others harbor **heretical views**; their roots and capacities differ. When they study, they attain what aligns with their inherent nature—thus, there are **Great Vehicle** and **Lesser Vehicle** paths.\n\nThese are the **thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao**, meant to **dispel** the doubts of those who seek and to **respond** to the intentions of those who come to inquire after the **Way**. Some say it is to **respond to the intentions of those destined to come**, each receiving according to their affinity and belief.\n\nThus, those who attain **enlightenment** speak of their doubts **dissolving like ice melting**. The character **dispel** (*shì*) is correct. Those who use **choose** (*zé*) instead are mistaken.\n\nThe **Three Dragons** refer to the **beginning**, **middle**, and **end** of the **Dragon Han** era. Some say: **Dragon Han**, **Dragon Kang**, and **Dragon Zheng**. When **mixed qi** universally dissipates, the age grows auspicious, and **demonic influences** subside. The **Heavens rejoice in assembly**, gathering in times of universal prosperity. Some say: the **Heavens rejoice in the **Law Assembly***.\n\nThe **Mystic Precepts of Heaven’s Law** have **natural prohibitions**. Though the **Dao** does not discriminate in its transmission, speaking to the unworthy is **profaning Heaven’s treasures** and risks **erroneous speech**. Thus, the **Sages of the Three Teachings** must find the **right time**, the **right place**, and the **right person** before they **deliver the Law** and **transmit the Dao**.\n\nThe **Golden Decree** is compared to the **Mystic Decree**—it judges **merit and demerit** according to the **Law’s ordinances**. To **bow and rise before the Divine Kings** means to **look upward to the Immortals and downward to the Heavenly Kings and Marshal-Gods**, acknowledging the **Law’s** noble benefits.\n\nTo **govern the Primordial Sovereign’s Heavens** is to **command and lead** the Heavens transformed by the **Primordial Origin**. Some say: **bow and rise** (*fǔyǎng*) is akin to **demonstrate** (*shì*), meaning to **show reverence in bowing and humility in listening** before the Divine Kings, thus **governing the Primordial Sovereign’s Heavens**. To **assemble and lead the Heavens** is to **draw near to the **Law Vehicle** of the **Primordial Origin’s** highest Heaven. Both interpretations are valid.\n\n---\n**Chapter on Divine Incantations**\n\nThen, the **Five Elder Celestial Sovereigns**, along with the **True Saints**, offered **pure incense**, upheld the **Precepts**, and wandered the **Cloud Paths**, summoning the **Ten Directions** with their **whistled commands**. They ascended to the **Upper Pure Supreme Mystic Jade Capital**, the **Cold-Spirit Elixir Hall**, and the **Purple Micro Upper Palace**, receiving the **Decree of Bowing and Rising**. Only then did they realize the **Heavenly Truth’s** nobility and rarity—how difficult it is to hear it immediately. Returning, they once more knelt before the **Primordial Dao**, inquiring about the **rituals of prohibition and precept**, humbly apologizing for their inadequacy.\n\nThey listened to the **Celestial Voice** through the **Golden Decree** before receiving the **True Scripture’s Heavenly Texts**.\n\nThus, the **Five Elder Celestial Sovereigns of the Five Directions**, along with the **Heavenly True Saints**, donned **pure incense**, observed the **Dao Precepts**, and circled the **Cloud Crossroads**, coming and going in guidance. They lingered along the **Cloud Paths**, chanting and commanding the **Ten Directions’ Holy Ones**, ascending to the **Upper Pure Supreme Mystic Jade Capital**, the **Heavenly Palace of Wondrous Realms**, the **Cold-Spirit Elixir Throne Hall**, and the **Purple Micro Upper Mystic Palace**, receiving the **Decree of Bowing and Rising**.\n\nOnly then did they grasp the **Heavenly Texts’ True Scripture’s** exalted and solemn nature—how rare and difficult it is to hear immediately. Returning, they once more knelt before the **Primordial Dao**, seeking clarification on the **rituals of prohibition and precept**, humbly acknowledging their insufficient wisdom.\n\n**Pure Incense** refers to the **True Nature’s Heavenly Incense**, the **Pure and Natural Incense**, the **Non-Action’s Supreme Moral Dao Incense**—not the mundane burnt incense of the world.\n\n**Upholding the Precepts** means observing the **Mystic Standards** with solemn reverence, as before the **Dao Ancestors**. They **guarded the Heavenly Sovereign’s Law Precepts**, wandering in boundless compassion, their **Mystic Light Vehicle** commanding the **Ten Directions** along the **Cloud Paths**.\n\nThe ancient scholars said: *\"Heavenly Light and Cloud Shadows wander together\"*—this is the meaning. It is not like the worldly **hesitation and back-and-forth movement**.\n\n**Whistled Commands to the Ten Directions**—the **whistle** (*xiào*) is pronounced as **decree** (*chè*), not as **laugh** (*xiào*). Those who read it as **finesse** (*xiù*) are mistaken. The **whistle** is a solemn proclamation, not a jest or laughter.\n\n**Ten Directions** refers not to the **Ten Sacred Treasures**, but to the **Ten Directional Divine Departments**.\n\nTo **ascend to the Immortals** is to **pay homage to the Primordial** and receive the **Law**, ascending in **Mystic Light** in silence, reverently listening to the **Mystic Teachings**—not the mundane climbing of steps.\n\nThe **Cold-Spirit Elixir Hall** lies above the **Nine Heavens**, where there is no sound or breath; the sun and moon cannot reach it. The **Heavenly Light** shines of its own accord, vast and boundless, pure and coldly solemn. The **Elixir Hall** radiates **Great Vermilion Jade Light**, hence the name.\n\nThe **Purple Micro Upper Palace** is the **Upper Mystic Palace** within the **Taiwei Heaven** above the **Purple Confluence**—not the **Purple Micro Enclosure** or **Taiwei Enclosure** as known in the mundane world.\n\n**Bowing and Rising Decree**—see earlier explanation.\n\n**Difficult to hear immediately** does not mean it is hard to hear at that very moment, but that it is difficult to **hear and immediately comprehend**. Some say: the **Heavenly Capital’s Scripture Keepers** do not allow immediate hearing. Returning, they once more ascend to the **Primordial Sovereign’s Nine Heavens**, paying homage to the **Supreme Primordial**, and are granted the **rituals of prohibition and precept**.\n\n**Inquire**—see earlier explanation. To ask about the **Heavenly Law’s rituals** for transmitting and receiving the **Law**.\n\n**Prohibition** refers to **decrees**; **Precept** refers to **statutes**.\n\n**Humbly apologizing for inadequacy** does not mean they could not uphold prohibitions or observe precepts, but that they modestly acknowledged their **insufficient wisdom**—though their bodies were divine and their **Law Treasures** had never been truly penetrated, hearing them at once left their wisdom **unable to grasp** the depth. This is the true nobility of the **Five Old Ones’ Heavenly Dao**.\n\nIt is not self-imposed limitation, but the recognition that they were **unworthy to receive** this.\n\nAll things under Heaven have their **principles** and can **hear the Dao**. Thus, the **Four Spirits** gather their respective talents. Humans are the **most spiritual** of all things, and **Divine Beings** are the **highest rank** in the world—how could they not hear the **Dao**?\n\nThus, **Yan Hui** daily listened to **Confucius’ teachings** without deviation, as if in ignorance, yet understood through dialogue. After **Zhuo Lu’s** departure, he said, *\"Though I wish to follow, there is no way.\"*\n\nThe **Bodhisattva Manjushrī** transmitted the **Sakyamuni Buddha’s True Law of the True Vehicle**—those who heard it were **deeply moved**.\n\n「This aligns with the same meaning.\n\nThose who hold this **Sutra** understand the **Five Old Ones’** humble yet profound intent in revering its sacred teachings—thus, they grasp the **Dao**.\n\nThe **Divine Beings’** *Spiritual Incantations* consist of **nine chapters**. At that time, the **Heavenly Sovereign** of boundless **virtue/power** and compassionate countenance, in pity, opened the **Spiritual Gate** and commanded the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords**, to reveal the **Dongyang Sunlight Hall**. Unfolding the **Nine Radiant Lights and Eight Colors** of their **treasure**, the **Cloud-Brocade Bag**, they produced the ***Elemental Origin’s Spiritual Treasure: Scarlet Scripture, Jade Leaf, True Text***, inscribed in **golden script and jade seals**, profound and mysterious, capable of governing the **Heavenly Dao** and **Earthly principles** of all worlds. The ***Great Illuminating Perfection, Great Spiritual Treasure Incantation of the Jade Chapter***, was then proclaimed and entrusted to the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords**.\n\nUpon receiving this **Sutra**, the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords** bowed in reverence, and the **Celestial Saints** of all realms knelt in homage, thanking the **Heavenly Sovereign, Jade Emperor**. They uplifted the **Dao’s** intent and followed the **Law** to transmit it.\n\nThe **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords** and the **True Saints** were unworthy to receive this, yet at that time, the **Elemental Origin’s Heavenly Sovereign** of boundless **virtue/power** and compassionate countenance, in pity and mercy, opened the **Spiritual Gate** with divine radiance. He commanded the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords** to reveal the **Heavenly Sunlight Hall of Dongyang**, unfurling the **Nine Glorious Clouds and Eight Scenic Colors** of their **treasure**, the **Cloud-Brocade Bag**, and produced the ***Elemental Origin’s Spiritual Treasure: Scarlet Scripture, Jade Leaf, True Text***, inscribed in **golden script and jade seals**, profound and mysterious, secret and profound, capable of governing and harmonizing all worlds and **Heavenly Dao and Earthly principles**, the ***Great Illuminating Perfection, Supreme Great Spiritual Treasure Incantation of the Jade Chapter***, which was then proclaimed and entrusted to the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords**.\n\nAt that time, the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords** had received this **Sutra** in full. The **Celestial Saints** of all realms knelt in homage, thanking the **Heavenly Sovereign, Jade Emperor**. They uplifted the **Elemental Origin’s Dao** and followed this **Sutra’s** golden **Law**, to transmit it to all **Divine Beings and Humans** across the realms.\n\n**Mercy and instruction**. **Mercy (愍)**, that is, the **Great Compassion (大悲)**.\n\n「Instruction (谕), the act of opening and guiding. Some mistakenly claim it should be read as *and-yú* (和愉), but this is incorrect.\n\nThe **Divine Passages** were revealed. The **Heaven of Sutra Storage**, the **Crimson Spirit’s Mystic Portal**, stood wide and gaping.\n\nOne interpretation states: The **Divine Passages** were revealed to open the **Sacred Core**, to awaken the Heart and manifest the True.\nAnother interpretation states: The **Sacred Eyes** emitted radiance, and the **Divine Passages** were revealed.\nBoth interpretations are valid.\n\n**Ascending to Proclaim**. The **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords** were elevated in rank, brought near to receive the **Sovereign’s Personal Command**.\n\nThe **Dawning Yang’s Jade Hall**, the **Nine-Heaven Mystic Hall**, was boundless and unobstructed, eternally luminous and never dark. It was not constructed of tiles, stones, earth, or wood, but adorned with **Mystic Radiance** and wondrous scenes, its **Spiral Script** intricately arranged, a **Jade Chapter** of emerald hue—thus it was called.\n\nThe **Nine Lights** have been explained previously. The **Eight Colors** are: **Supreme Azure (太青)**, **Supreme Vermilion (太赤)**, **Supreme Yellow (太黄)**, **Supreme White (太白)**, **Supreme Dark (太玄)**, **Celestial Cyan (葱苍)**, **Jade Green (碧玉)**, and **Purple Gold (紫金)**.\n\n**韫 (yùn)**, the repository of the **Sutra**, wherein the boundless **Mystic Radiance** is entirely contained.\n**披 (pī)**, to unfold and reveal.\nThe **Cloud-Silk Bag**, the **Celestial Brocade of Clouds and Mist**, was a natural formation of **Dao** emanations, not the handiwork of the **Heavenly Youth** weaving. It was called a bag because the **Sutra’s** annotations were inscribed within it. The **Divine Beings** could not fathom its depths—thus it was called.\nIt was not like the coarse cloth, silk, leather, or furs of the mortal world.\n\nThe phrases *\"Great Illuminating Perfection\"* and *\"Supreme Great Spiritual Treasure\"* through *\"Heavenly Dao and Earthly principles\"* have all been explained previously.\n\n**Great Radiance (大光明)**, for the **True Scripts** of the **Three Teachings** all extol the **Law of Perfection** as the **Spiritual Treasure**, and wherever it resides, there is light. The **Scriptures** of all other **Teachings** have limited radiance, but this *Royal Sutra*’s **Law** permeates the **Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds**, its luminosity undiminished across **aeons of kalpas**—thus it is called **Great Radiance**.\n\n**Round and Fulfilled (圆满)**, the **Sacred Heart**’s boundless compassion and salvation. If one’s power is insufficient, the scope is limited, and there are deficiencies—thus it was said that one could not transform the **Northern Pole’s Lu State** nor the **Self-Sovereign Celestial Beings**, and it was difficult to call such **Round and Fulfilled**.\n\nThis *Royal Sutra* encompasses all **dharma**, penetrating all **vehicles**, its efficacy infinite and inexhaustible. Though it is said that the **Dao** does not force or compel, its transformations occur naturally, and all categories of beings—from beginning to end—cycle through its influence without any who are not transformed by it. Thus it is called **Round and Fulfilled**.\n\nThe **Divine Incantation of the Jade Chapter**, the **Essential Teachings of the True Ones**, the **Mystic Secrets of the Gods**, the **Key Essence for Delivering the World**—all other **Teachings’** divine powers do not surpass this; its reverence is unmatched. Thus it is called.\n\nAnother examination: Human nature’s enlightenment of the **Dao** is vast and enduring, difficult to forget even through **great kalpas**. Like a bag that does not leak, the moment of awakening is akin to the mouth of the bag—thus the **Sutra’s** annotations speak of the bag.\n\n**Heavenly Sovereign (天尊)**, some read it connected to the preceding sentence: *\"They knelt in homage and thanked the **Heavenly Sovereign, Original Beginning**\"*; others read it connected to the following: *\"The **Jade Emperor** is the **Sovereign** of all **Heavens**.\"* The latter interpretation may be adopted. The rest has been explained previously.\n\nThe **Divine Incantations Chapter** consists of ten sections. At that time, the **Heavenly Sovereign of the Azure Spirit (青灵始老苍帝)**, who received the **Divine Incantations Edict**, was stationed in the **Eastern Treasure Forest of Peaceful Preservation (安宝华林)**. The **Eastern Nine Qi (九炁)**—the Azure Sovereign of the Original Heaven (始皇青天), the Verdant Celestial Pile (碧霞郁垒)**—within which dwells the **Venerable Old Man (老人)**, oversees the **Register of Destiny (图录)**, commands the **Qi** and ascends to **Xian (仙)**.\n\nTo the right, the **Secret Scriptures of the Azure Sovereign for Delivering Humans to Xian (度人录仙青帝秘文)****,** twenty-four characters, inscribed upon the **Mysterious Terrace of the Nine Heavens (九天玄台)**, governs the summoning of the **Nine-Heaven Sovereign (九天上帝)** and the rectification of the **Register of Immortals (神仙图录)**. The **Year-Star (岁星)** assists the liver, while the **Horn (角)** and **Knee (亢)** stars stabilize the **True (真)**. The **Room (房)** and **Tail (尾)** stars oversee the **Four Scenes (四景)**, revolving in harmony. The **Sieves (箕)** commands the seven stars of the **Big Dipper (七辰)**, while the **Upright Fighter (正斗)** illuminates the **Wheel of Destiny (明轮)**. By capturing **Qi** and seizing the **False (非)**, it sweeps away the **Group of Calamities (灾群)**.\n\nTo the right, the **Secret Scriptures of the Stars (制星秘文)**, thirty-two characters, inscribed in the **Eastern Hall of the Purple Micro (紫微宫东华殿)**, governs the summoning of the **Celestial Officials (星官)** and the rectification of the **Heavenly Divisions and Degrees (天分度)**.\n\nThe **Eastern Mountain Divine Incantations (东山神咒)**, inscribed in **Red Scriptures and Edicts (赤书符命)**, subdue the **Mountain of Assemblies (酆山)**, bind the **Demons (魔)**, and dispatch the **Ghosts (鬼)**—none escape its judgment. All must proceed to the **Wood Palace (木宫)**, daring not to delay.\n\nTo the right, the **Secret Scriptures Against Demons (制魔秘文)**, thirty-two characters, inscribed in the **Eastern Hall of the Mysterious Spirit (东华玄灵之馆)**, governs the subjugation of **Ghosts and Demons (鬼魔)** and the rectification of the **Nine-Heaven Qi (九天炁)**. Below, it commands the **Eastern River (东河)** and the **Spirits of the Boundless Seas (溟海水神)**. In times of **Great Kalpas (大劫)** and **Flooding Disasters (洪灾)**, the **Kylin Dragons (蛟龙)** bear the weight of their bodies. When the **Water Palaces (水府)** are opened, the paths extend ten thousandfold. The **Heavenly Sovereign’s Red Scriptures (上帝赤文)** command the winds and fires without obstruction.\n\nTo the right, the **Secret Scriptures of Water (制水秘文)**, thirty-two characters, inscribed upon the **Nine-Heaven Eastern-Northern Jade Gate and Vermilion Terrace (九天东北玉阙丹台)**, governs the subjugation of the **Eastern Sea Water Sovereign (东海水帝)**, the **Great Kalpa Flooding Disasters (大劫洪灾)**, and the summoning of **Kylin Dragons (蛟龙)** and **Water Spirits (水神)** for their duties.\n\nThe **True Scripture of the Eastern Nine Qi Spirit Treasures (《东方九炁灵宝玉篇》)****—**all one hundred twenty characters—**are the perfect scriptures of the **Supreme Lord of the Most High Great Radiant Dao (太上无上大光明)**,** the **Complete and Natural Divine Incantations (圆满神咒空洞自然之书)**. It is also known as the **Scripture of the Birth of the Divine and Preservation of the True (《生神保真洞玄章》)****,** the **Eastern Mountain Divine Incantations (《东山神咒》)****,** and the **Azure Sovereign’s Eight Thunders Edict (《青帝八威策文》)**.\n\nThese **Edicts of the Jade Emperor (玉皇诰命)**** are granted to the **Nine-Qi Heavenly Lords of the Eastern Treasure Forest of Peaceful Preservation, Azure Spirit Heavenly Sovereign (东方安宝华林青灵始老苍帝九炁天君)**,** commanding them to oversee all **Eastern Heavens and Earths (东方诸天诸地)**, the **Sun, Moon, and Starry Hosts (日月星宿)**, the **Sacred Mountains and Spirit Caverns (名山灵洞)**, the **Water Palaces and Spring Palaces (水府泉宫)**, the **Supreme High Lords (上圣高尊)**, and the **Holy Immortal Assemblies (真仙圣众)**—**all manifestations of power and spirit (一切威灵)**.

and earth have limits,\nall beings may eventually perish—\nyet why say *all myriad categories endure*?\nFrom kalpa to kalpa, life perpetually renews,\nall relying on the Great **Dao/Way**—\nthus it is said *all myriad categories endure*.\n\nThe *Great Divine Cauldron*’s **Scripture** comprises sixteen chapters,\nwhich the Jade Sovereign once bestowed upon the Five *Lao* Celestial Deities.\n\nAt that time, the Five Emperors knelt in long reverence,\nholding this sacred scroll,\nsecretly inscribed with praises in the **mystic capital** (*Língdū*).\n\nThe *Heavenly True Immortal* (*Tiānzhēn*)

words are **Dao/Way**’s mysteries, not worldly texts—\nhow then speak of *handwritten*?\nThe heavenly gods reverently embrace it,\nexpressing utmost respect.\n\n**Secretly inscribed**—\nthis means to praise and record it.\nThe Heavenly True Immortals’ scriptures\nare all **Dao/Way**’s radiant celestial texts,\ngolden and jade characters,\neach a wondrous span of a yard in length.\nThe *Upper Purity Sacred Realm* is the abode of the **Lingbao** treasures**,\nand the **Scripture** originates from the *Primordial Beginning*’s Exalted Sovereign,\ntransmitted by **Lingbao**—\nthus it is called the *Upper Purity Sacred Realm*.\nIts words preserve the **heavenly roots**,\nthe **Scripture**’s essence unbroken through kalpas—\nthus the **heavenly roots**’ eternal preservation is known.\n\nSome may say it preserves the **heaven’s root**,\nmaking it endure—\nthis cannot be followed.\nFor after the *Primordial Beginning* (*Yuán Huì*),\nheaven cannot last forever—\nthus it is known this is not the **heaven’s root**.\n\n**Aligned with the revolutions**—\nenduring through kalpas.\n\nWhen mixed with chaos, it remains undefiled—\nwhen laws and doctrines are confused,\nthe true **Dao/Way** persists,\nyet this **Scripture** cannot be defiled.\nWhen defiled, it shines ever purer—\nthose who profane this **Scripture** face heavenly punishment,\nits **virtue/power** and purity ever more

through kalpas,\nfound everywhere without absence—\nnot ordinary forms,\nbut **wondrous existence** (*miàohǔ*).\nThus it is called *the **Great Ultimate***.\n\nSome may say *the **Great Ultimate**’s profound mysteries* are the words of the *Court of Ultimate Mysteries*—\nthis is too restrictive.»\n\nIlluminating future births—\nthe myriad lives to come are not merely one person’s future existence.\nThose unable to glimpse or hear it—\nonly the **Most Venerable Ones** (*zhìshèng*) know this **Scripture**,\nwhile common folk merely recite its words.\n\nEvil spirits dare not

restrictive.\n\nOne alternative:\n*preserve the **ten thousand transformations**’s *qi* eternally,\nalso suffices.\n\nThis passage reveals the **Scripture**’s manifest efficacy.\n\n**Chapter 3: The Virtue/Power of the Jade Sovereign** (*Yùhuáng Gōngdé Pǐn*)\n**Continuation of Chapter 1, following the previous ten chapters**\nAt that time, the Jade Void Emperor (*Yùxū Dìshì*) addressed the Celestial Venerable (*Tiānzūn*):\n\n*\"May the Most Venerable One’s compassion universally benefit the Four Assemblies, the **Emperors and Releases** (*Dìshè*), the Four **Brahmā Kings** (*Fàn Tiānwáng*), all the **Heavens** (*Zhūtian*), all the **Immortal Ones** (*Zhūxiān*), and all future beings who uphold this **Scripture** and proclaim its benefits.\"*\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Venerable replied to the Jade Void Emperor:\n\n*\"How joyous is this inquiry—\nis it not most excellent? (*bù yì shànhū*)\nYou, moved by compassion,\npity the suffering of all beings,\nthus asking me for elucidation.\nReturn to your seat,\nand I shall expound it for you.*\n\nWhen the Jade Sovereign (*Yùdì*) entrusted this **Scripture** to the Five Elders of the Emperor,\nthe Jade Void Emperor ascended and reported to the **Great Celestial Venerable** (*Dà Tiānzūn*), the **Scripture**’s master:\n\n*\"May the Most Venerable One’s compassion universally benefit the world’s Four Assemblies,\nall the **Heavenly Emperors and Releases** (*Tiānshì Dìshè*),\nthe Four **Brahmā Kings** of the Three Realms (*Sānjiè shàng sì Fàn Tiānwáng*),\nall the **Heavens** (*Zhūtian*),\nall the **Immortal Ones** of every rank (*Zhūxiān*),\nand all future beings who uphold this **True Scripture** and proclaim its benefits.\"*\n\nAt that time, the **Great Celestial Venerable**, the **Scripture**’s master, replied to the Jade Void Emperor:\n\n*\"How gladdening is this question—\nis it not most excellent? (*bù yì shànhū*)\nYou, with compassionate heart,\npity the world’s suffering beings,\nthus asking me for elucidation.\nReturn to your seat,\nand I shall expound the **Scripture**’s meaning for you.\"*\n\nWhen the **Celestial Venerable** (*Tiānzūn*) refers to *Yuan Shi*,\nor to the Jade Sovereign (*Yùdì*),\nthis is incorrect.\nThe Four Assemblies (*Sìzhòng*) are explained earlier.\n**Emperors and Releases** (*Dìshè*) are the Heavenly Emperors,\nand the **Buddhas, Bodhisattvas** (*Fó, Púsà*), and others of the **Release Teachings** (*Shìjiào*).\nSome may say all Heavenly sovereigns are called **Emperors and Releases**,\nwhich is also acceptable.\nIf one mistakenly takes *Emperor* (*Dì*) as the sovereign of the **Emperors and Releases Heaven** (*Dìshè Tiān*),\nthis is the erroneous interpretation of the **Monks** (*Sēngjiā*).\nThey wrongly apply the Heavenly sovereigns of all **Scriptures** to the Jade Sovereign,\nunaware that the Jade Sovereign is the **宗** (*zōng*) of the ten thousand **Heavens**,\nnot merely the sovereign of one **Heaven**.\n\nThe **Release Teachings** (*Shìjiào*) state:\n*\"The **Brahmā King Emperor** (*Fànwáng Dìshè*) is the **呈祥** (*chéngxiáng*).\"*\nThis means the **宗** (*zōng*) of the Heavenly **Buddhas**,\nnot daring to speak of the Jade Sovereign.\nMonks arbitrarily misinterpret,\nwhich is also a grave offense.\nHence, I include them both.\n\nThe Four **Brahmā Kings** (*Sì Fàn Tiānwáng*) are the great **Brahmā Kings** of the Three Realms’ uppermost tier,\nnot the sovereigns of the **Desire Realm**’s lower **Heavens**.\nWhen speaking of **Brahmā Heavens** (*Fàn Tiān*),\nit encompasses all upper **Realms**.\nThe **Heavens of the Heavenly Hosts** (*Zhǒngmín Zhūtian*) are not mentioned,\nfor their ranks above are all **至真大仙** (*Zhìzhēn Dàxiān*—**Supreme True Immortals**),\nwho naturally align with this **Scripture**,\nthus no need to specify them.\n\nAll the **Heavens** (*Zhūtian*), all the **Immortal Ones** (*Zhūxiān*—**of every rank**),\nfrom beneath the **Brahmā Heavens** down,\nall Heavenly sovereigns, deities, and **民** (*mín*—**subjects of the Heavens**),\nand all **Immortal Ones** of every rank (*Zhūxiān*).\n\n**Proclaiming its benefits**—\nthe **Great Dao/Way** does not speak of effects,\nso why does the Jade Void Emperor request benefits to be spoken of?\nThe **Great Dao/Way** is the **宗** (*zōng*) of all **Heavens**, earth, and beings.\nIt inherently possesses real benefits,\nbringing natural advantage to all beings.\nThe **Heavens**, earth, and the Four Assemblies,\nwho do not know this **Scripture**,\ndo not understand its meaning,\ndare not believe or follow it,\nthus they slight the **Great Law** (*Dàfǎ*)\nand mislead themselves.\nThe **Great Dao/Way**’s compassion is boundless,\nunable to bear the world’s delusion,\nthus it speaks of benefits to guide beings.\nHow can the foolish and deluded still say,\n*\"This **Scripture** merely contains trivial and obscure theories—\nwhat benefit does it bring?\"*\n\nDo they not know that this **Scripture** gives birth to all **Heavens**, earth, and beings,\nand cannot be separated for even a moment?\nAll beings, everywhere, should recite and uphold it,\nthroughout kalpas without end,\nbringing great natural benefits,\nnot merely alluring people with effects.\nIs it not most excellent?\nThis is not a word of doubt,\nbut a commendation of the excellent inquiry.\n\n*\"You\"* (*rǔ*)—\nYuan Shi addresses the Jade Void Emperor.\n*\"I\"* (*wú*)—\nYuan Shi refers to himself.\n*\"Return to your seat\"* (*fù zuò*)—\na command for the Jade Void Emperor to resume his listening position.\n\n*\"I shall expound\"* (*xiānshuò*)—\n*broadly proclaim* (*guǎngbù wéi xiān*) and *explain* (*gàoyǔ wéi shuò*).\n\n**Fàn** (*Brahmā*)—\npronounced as *fú* (with the tone of 扶 *fú*).\n\nSome mistakenly write it as **梵** (*Fàn*), but this is incorrect.\n\nThis is the sincere request to expound the **Scripture**,\nand the heart of universal benefit.\n\n**Continuation of Chapter 18, following the previous ten chapters**\nThe Celestial Venerable spoke:\n\n*\"If within the Three Realms or the ten directions of boundless lands,\nwars arise and armies clash,\nor pestilential **qi** (*yìqì*) spreads,\nor floods, droughts, insects, and locusts plague the land,\nor calamities bring famine,\nthen the kings and ministers of those lands\nshould issue compassionate decrees,\ncommanding all officials in their states, counties, towns, and prefectures,\nto order the **Dao/Way**’s adherents (*Dàomén zhūliú*)\nto maintain purity and solemnity,\nand within their **observatories** (*guàn*)\nestablish grand **fasting rituals** (*Zhāijiào*),\npracticing the **Dao/Way** at all six times of day,\nto circulate this **Scripture**,\nthen the land will achieve peace,\nthe five grains will flourish abundantly,\nand the people will live in security and harmony.\"*\n\nAfter the Yuan Shi Celestial Venerable commanded the Jade Void Emperor to return to his seat and listen to the **Scripture**,\nhe spoke thus:\n\n*\"If within the Three Realms—**Heavens**, earth, and humans—\nor the ten directions of the four **Quadrants** (*Sìzhèng*), four **Pairs** (*Sì’ǒu*), and their upper and lower tiers,\nor the limitless lands of all **Realms**,\nwars arise and armies clash,\nor Heavenly calamities spread, encountering pestilential **qi** (*yìqì*) rampant,\nor years bring scarcity, with floods, droughts, insects, and locusts,\nor disasters cause famine,\nthen the kings and ministers of those lands\nshould issue compassionate decrees,\nfor their **黎民** (*Límín*—**common folk**), officials, and subjects,\ncommanding all within the states, counties, towns, and prefectures,\nto order the **Dao/Way**’s adherents (*Dàomén zhūliú*)\nto maintain **清冷** (*qīnglěng*—**cool purity**) and solemnity (*yánjié*),\nand within their **observatories** (*guàn*)\nestablish grand **齐醮** (*Qíjiào*—**fasting rituals for purification and expiation**),\npracticing the **Dao/Way** at all six times of day (*báijiū xiángdào*),\nto circulate this **True Scripture**,\nthen the land will achieve peace (*qīngpíng*),\nthe five grains will flourish abundantly (*wǔgǔ fēngshú*),\nand the people will live in security and harmony (*Límín āntài*).\"*\n\nSome may say the Three Realms cannot be called **Heavens**,\nfor fear of conflicting with the phrase *lands, armies, and calamities*.\nBut the **Heavenly Demons** (*Tiānmó*) and Heavenly sovereigns\ncontend for dominion in the streets,\nengaging in battles,\neach with their own demarcated **Realms** (*jiè*),\nthus it is known that the Three Realms refer to **Heavens**, earth, and humans.\n\n「When wars and conflicts (*bīnggē*) erupt, it refers not to two distinct kinds of weapons rising simultaneously, but rather to hostilities breaking out in various places—each side engaging in mutual warfare. Swords, spears, and all such implements are simply weapons (*bīngqì*), no different from *戈* (*gē*—**halberds**) or *戟* (*jǐ*—**crossbow spears**). Thus, it is incorrect to say that \"wars and conflicts\" (*bīnggē*) arise together.\n\nSome may argue that \"wars and conflicts\" (*bīnggē*) mean \"soldiers and weapons\" (*bīng zuò rén*—**soldiers and men**), with \"men\" and \"weapons\" (*rén gē*) arising together, but this is also not accurate.\n\nWhen pestilential **qi** (*yìqì*—**epidemic qi**) spreads rampantly, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven (*Tiāndào*—**Heavenly Dao/Way**) maintains its regular order, yet calamities are termed as \"variations\" (*bìan*—**aberrations**). The rampant spread of pestilential **qi** (*yìqì*) is indeed a calamity (*zāiyì*—**disaster and aberration**). The same holds true for epidemics (*shíli*—**seasonal pestilence**), which are also calamities (*zāiyì*).\n\nThis **Scripture** (*jīng*—**Sutra**) serves to rescue and alleviate such afflictions.\n\nFloods and droughts (*shuǐhàn*—**water and fire calamities**), insects ravaging crops (*chóng*—**pests**), and swarms of locusts destroying harvests (*qúnxiāng shāngjià*—**locusts harm the grain**) are all calamities (*zāiyì*).\n\nWhen harvests fail (*suì bù shú*—**years of poor harvest**), causing suffering among people and creatures (*mínwù bù ān*—**the populace and living beings are unsettled**), it is termed as *凶* (*xiōng*—**harsh calamity**). When things deviate from the norm (*yìcháng*—**aberrant**), it is called *灾* (*zāi*—**disaster**); when grains are not ripe (*gǔ bù shú*—**grains do not mature**), it is *饥* (*jī*—**famine**); when vegetables are not ripe (*cài bù shú*—**vegetables do not mature**), it is *馑* (*jǐn*—**scarcity**).\n\nAll these are calamities (*zāiyì*).\n\n*黎* (*Lí*—**common folk**), *黔黎* (*Qiánlí*—**the dark-skinned commoners**); *庶* (*shù*—**commoners**), *庶民* (*shùmín*—**the populace**).\n*遍勑* (*biànli*—**to exhaustively exhort**).\n*遍* (*biàn*) and *徧* (*biàn*) are the same.\n\n*州县镇宰* (*zhōuxiàn zhènzǎi*—**regional governors and magistrates**), which may mean:\n- the officials who govern states and counties, overseeing the common folk (*zhōuxiàn tǒngzhèn bǎixìng zhī guān*—**governors and magistrates who control the populace**), or\n- the officials of military garrisons (*zhèn*—**military prefectures**), or\n- the high-ranking officials such as the viceroys and governors-general (*duūfū*—**supervisors and envoys**).\n\nAll interpretations are valid.\n\nThese are the kings and ministers of their respective lands, just as the kings and ministers of these places [mentioned earlier].」\n\n「The Daoists, including those of the **Quánzhēn** (Complete Reality), **Zhèngyī** (Orthodox Unity), **Qīngwēi** (Pure Mystery), and **Língbǎo** (Numinous Treasure) sects, are marked by **purity and solemnity**, both inwardly and outwardly, with their bodies and minds in perfect harmony. Their attire and ritual spaces are meticulously ordered, and they conduct themselves with **reverence, solemnity, and unwavering consistency**—thus embodying **purity and solemnity**.\n\n*Guān* (观), meaning **contemplation**, is where the **divine presence** resides. Those who gaze upon it rise in **awe and respect**—this is indeed the **Great Vision**. Hence, it is called *guān*.\n\nThey establish **grand liturgical rites** (*dàzhài jiào*—**great exorcistic offerings**), harmonizing the inner and outer, uniting the collective will, and rectifying discord through **fasting** (*zhāi*). They **invoke and thank the divine beings** (*qíxiè shénzhī*—**pray to and give thanks to the divine**), repay the heavens and earth, **concentrate virtue upon the divine** (*hé dé yú shén*—**merge virtue with the divine**), and, following the prescribed methods, **attract blessings** (*yīkē qìfú*—**invoke blessings according to the ritual**) through *jiào* (醮).\n\nThey practice the Dao **six times daily** (*liùshí xíngdào*—**sixfold Daoic observance**), not as the common practice of wandering along roads, but simply by **following the ritual to invoke the divine** (*yīkē qìshén*—**invoke the divine according to the ritual**) and **reciting scriptures and Daoic teachings** (*zhuǎnjīng niàndào*—**turning the scriptures and reciting the Dao**).\n\nSome say the **twelve times of day and night** (*shíèr shí*), with **odd hours** (*qíshí*) for activity and **even hours** (*ǒushí*) for stillness. The **six times** (*liùshí*) should be understood as **子, 寅, 辰, 午, 申, 戍**—the **midnight, 3-5 AM, 7-9 AM, noon, 3-5 PM, and 7-9 PM hours**. Alternatively, some interpret it as the **six daytime hours** (*báizhòu liùshí*—**six hours of daylight**). Both interpretations are acceptable.\n\n**Turning the scriptures** (*zhuǎnjīng*) means aligning one’s mind with the Dao, holding the **authentic scriptures** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scriptures**), ensuring that **lands and beings are free from calamity** (*guótǔ wú èjiān*—**countries and beings without hardship**), and attaining **serene peace** (*dé qīngpíng*).\n\nRice, millet, sorghum, beans, and wheat—**the five grains** (*wǔgǔ*)—all flourish in abundance. The **common folk** (*língmín*—**people of the populace**) across all lands and realms suffer no disasters, forever dwelling in **tranquil security** (*ānrán dìng*—**secure stillness**) and **unshaken joy** (*tàirán lè*—**unfaltering happiness**).\n\nThe **merits and virtues** (*gōngdé pǐn*) continue from the previous nineteen chapters. If one encounters **venomous and ferocious beasts** (*dú è wūshòu*—**poisonous, evil, and fierce beasts**) in the mountains and forests, simply **retain a single thought** (*cúnxiǎng yīniàn*—**hold in mind a single thought**) of the **true scriptures** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scriptures**), and the **mountain deities** (*shāngshén*—**mountain spirits**) will guard and protect, while the beasts will naturally retreat, never harming the practitioner.\n\nIf one enters rivers and seas, **seeking treasures and precious things** (*cǎibǎo qiúzhēnjiàn*—**gathering treasures and seeking precious artifacts**), and encounters **malevolent winds** (*èfēng*—**evil winds**), causing the vessel to drift, then by **reciting and holding** (*shòu*—**receiving/holding**) this **true scripture** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scripture**) in accordance with the method, the winds will cease and the waves will still, allowing **safe arrival at shore** (*ānwěn dá'àn*—**securely reaching the shore**).\n\nThe blessings of the **true scripture** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scripture**) are not merely limited to **dispelling celestial calamities** (*xiāo tiānzāi*—**eliminating heavenly disasters**), ensuring **abundant harvests year after year** (*fēng suìnián*—**richness of years and harvests**), and **securing the populace** (*lìngshù ān*—**the commoners’ peace**). Even **sudden misfortunes** (*zùrán zhī biàn*—**sudden changes**), such as **mountains, rivers, winds, and waves** (*shānshuǐ fēngbō*—**mountains, waters, winds, and waves**) bringing peril, cannot harm the practitioner.\n\nIf one enters the mountains and forests and encounters **venomous and ferocious beasts** (*dú è wūshòu*—**poisonous, evil, and fierce beasts**), simply **retain a single thought** (*cúnxiǎng yīniàn*—**hold in mind a single thought**) of the **true scripture** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scripture**), never forgetting this **precious and wondrous method** (*bǎozhāng miàofǎ*—**treasured chapter and marvelous method**). The **mountain deities** (*shāngshén*—**mountain spirits**) will **guard and bestow protection** (*bǎowèi yòuhù*—**guard and protect**), and the beasts will naturally retreat, never harming the one who holds the scripture and enters the mountain.\n\nIf one enters the rivers and seas, **seeking treasures and precious artifacts** (*cǎibǎowù qiúzhēnjiàn*—**gathering treasures and seeking precious things**), and encounters **malevolent winds** (*èfēng*—**evil winds**), causing their **ships and boats** (*chuán fáng*—**vessels and boats**) to drift, then by following the **method of recitation and reception** (*rújīng zhōng shòushòu zhīfǎ*—**as the scripture teaches, the method of recitation and holding**) and **holding this true scripture** (*cúnxiǎng zhēnjīng*—**retaining this true scripture**), the great winds will subside and the waves will cease, allowing the **safe arrival of the practitioner’s vessel at shore** (*chuán wéi shāng’àn*—**the vessel’s secure arrival at shore**), with no harm befalling the one who holds the scripture.\n\nMountains and forests are **treacherous and obstructed** (*xiǎnzǔ*—**dangerous and blocked**), and **ferocious beasts and venomous insects** (*měngshòu dúchóng*—**fierce beasts and poisonous insects**) are **not to be approached** (*shì bùkě jìn*—**their nature forbids nearness**). If one encounters them, **injury is inevitable** (*bì zhì shānghài*—**certainly will be harmed**).\n\nYet, if one **retains a single thought** (*cúnxiǎng yīniàn*—**holds in mind a single thought**) of the **true scripture** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scripture**), merely **temporarily aligning with the Dao** (*bùguò zàn yǔ dào hé*—**nothing more than briefly merging with the Dao**), how can the beasts retreat so readily?\n\nThis is because **all beings—human and otherwise—originate from the same primordial *qi*** (*yuánqì*—**original *qi***), though they differ in **clarity and turbidity, completeness and partiality** (*qīngzhuó quánpiān*—**pure and impure, complete and incomplete**).\n\nAt the **beginning of heaven and earth** (*tiāndì zhī chū*—**when heaven and earth first formed**), humans and beasts coexisted in a **mixed and indistinct state** (*hùnchǔ rán*—**in a mingled, indistinct manner**), where **venomous insects and ferocious beasts** (*dúchóng èshòu*—**poisonous insects and evil beasts**) originally did not harm people.\n\nLater, as **human hearts grew false** (*rén xīn jiàn jiǎ*—**human minds became deceptive**), the **distance between humans and beasts widened** (*qù èchóng wūshòu*—**separation from venomous insects and fierce beasts**), leading to the beasts’ harm toward humans.\n\nIf humans **constantly perform good deeds** (*cháng xíng hǎoshì*—**always do good deeds**), **nurture benevolent thoughts** (*cún hǎoxīn*—**hold good hearts**), and **revere and trust the true scriptures** (*jìngxìn zhēnjīng*—**respect and believe the true scriptures**), never forgetting them, they become **great virtuous ones** (*dà shànrén*—**great benevolent people**).\n\nThus, when entering mountains and forests, they **will not encounter venomous insects or fierce beasts** (*zì bù yùdú è wūshòu*—**naturally will not meet venomous, evil beasts**).\n\nIf, however, one **ordinarily indifferent and lacking in virtue** (*yōngcháng wú shàngǒng*—**habitually mediocre without virtuous deeds**), enters the mountain and **suddenly encounters venomous insects or fierce beasts** (*shìrán yùdú è wūshòu*—**unexpectedly meets venomous, evil beasts**), yet **does not covet life nor fear death** (*bù tānshēng pàsǐ*—**not greedy for life nor afraid of death**), **does not panic nor lose composure** (*bù huángjù bù sīxīn*—**not flustered nor distracted in mind**), but **trusts in the true teaching** (*wéi xìn zhèngfǎ*—**solely believes in the true law**), **remains steadfast without wavering** (*zhuān yī wú èr*—**single-minded and unshaken**), **focuses inwardly and contemplates silently** (*cāocún mòxiǎng*—**holds in mind and silently reflects**), **retaining a single thought** (*yīniàn zhēnjīng*—**a single thought of the true scripture**), their **mind and the Dao merge** (*xīn yǔ dào jù*—**heart and Dao become one**), and the **mountain deities guard and protect**, while the **venomous insects and fierce beasts naturally retreat**.\n\nBeasts and insects are **stupid creatures** (*chǔnwù*—**dumb things**) of the Daoic path, though their **nature may be venomous and fierce** (*xìng suī dú è*—**nature though poisonous and evil**), they **kill and harm** (*hǎo shāngshā*—**love to kill and harm**). Yet, each has **objects of reverence, fears, and taboos** (*yǒu jìng, yǒu wèi, yǒu suǒjì*—**things they revere, fear, and avoid**).\n\nThus, **raptorial birds** (*zhìniǎo*—**fierce birds**) **revere the phoenix** (*zūn fèng*—**honor the *fèng* [august bird]**), **ferocious beasts** (*měngshòu*—**fierce beasts**) **bow to the qilin** (*cháo lín*—**pay homage to the *qílín* [auspicious unicorn]**), and **snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and other venomous insects** (*shéxiē wúgǒu zhūdúchóng*—**snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and other poisonous insects**) **fear cranes, *mànghóng* birds, herons, and *pèng* birds** (*wèi guàn mánghóng niǎo hè péng*—**dread the crane, *mànghóng* bird, heron, and *pèng* bird**), vanishing and refraining from their venom.\n\n**Immortal Daoists** (*xiānzhēn*—**immortal sages**) **comprehend the mechanism of life and transformation** (*dá shēnghuà zhī jī*—**grasp the principle of life and change**) and **know the source of control** (*míng kèzhì zhī yuán*—**understand the origin of subjugation**). Even **a single incantation** (*yī zhòuyǔ*—**one incantation**) or **a single talisman** (*yī fúshuǐ*—**one talisman**) inscribed with water can **subdue venomous insects and serpents** (*zhì chóngshé dú*—**control poisonous insects and snakes**), **resolve the calamity of tiger ferocity** (*jiě hǔhěn è*—**alleviate the tiger’s ferocious disaster**), **reverse the winds and turn the heavens** (*fǎnfēng huìtiān*—**turn back the winds and return the heavens**), and much more. How much greater is the **power of the *Huángjīng*** (*Huángjīng*—**the *Huángjīng* [Yellow Scripture]**), which is **the sovereign of all teachings** (*wànfǎ zhī zōng*—**the root of all laws**) and **the progenitor of heaven and earth** (*tiāndì zhī zǔ*—**the parent of heaven and earth**)!\n\nThe **birth and death of all things** (*wànwù shēngsǎ*—**all beings’ life and death**) **depend upon heaven and earth**, which in turn **originate from the Great Dao** (*běn yú dàdào*—**stem from the Great Way**).\n\nThus, when one **retains a single thought** (*cúnxiǎng yīniàn*—**holds in mind a single thought**) of this scripture, they **need not fear beasts and insects** (*bùjù chóngshòu*—**not dread beasts and insects**). The **radiance of the scriptural treasure** (*fǎbǎo guāng*—**the light of the sacred treasure**) shines, and **all deities guard** (*zhūshén wèi*—**all spirits protect**), though the beasts may be **stupid**, their **nature still reveres the Dao** (*xìng yì zūndào*—**nature respects the Way**), **fearing heaven and revering the divine** (*wèi tiān jù shén*—**dreading heaven and fearing the spirits**), and thus **naturally retreat**.\n\nRivers, lakes, and seas—**winds and waves pose dangers** (*fēngbō wēixiǎn*—**winds and waves are perilous**), seemingly **the heavens’ wrath** (*tiān zhī nù*—**heaven’s anger**), and **escape seems difficult** (*shù suǒ nán táo*—**fate seems hard to evade**). Yet this scripture is **the king of all teachings** (*wànfǎ zhī wáng*—**the sovereign of all laws**), and **winds, thunder, hail, and lightning** (*fēngléi báo diàn*—**winds, thunder, hail, and lightning**) are **the heavens’ wondrous applications of divine power** (*tiān zhī miàoyòng shénwēi*—**heaven’s marvelous use of spiritual might**).\n\nIf one **holds and recites this true scripture** (*cúnxiǎng zhēnjīng*—**retains this true scripture**) in accordance with the method, they **align with heaven and the Dao** (*tóng yú tiān, tóng yú dào*—**become one with heaven and the Dao**), and **heaven itself will cease its wrath** (*tiān yì wèi zhī jìwēi*—**heaven will abate its might**), allowing the **winds to subside and the waves to still** (*fēng xī, làng zhǐ*—**winds cease, waves still**), and the **vessel to reach shore securely** (*chuán ānrán dá’àn*—**the ship safely arrives**).\n\n**Verification and examination**: The *Yì* (易, *I Ching*) states: *\"Treading upon a tiger, its jaws bare—disaster.\"* The Master Confucius said: *\"Confronting a tiger barehanded and leaning upon a river in peril—die without regret.\"* Yet this scripture declares: *\"If one retains a single thought and holds this true scripture in accordance with the method, beasts will retreat and winds and waves will cease.\"* The *Dàodéjīng* (道德经, *Tao Te Ching*) speaks: *\"Those who align with the Dao: falcons do not strike, venomous insects do not sting, tigers and rhinoceroses dare not brandish their claws and horns, but hide their teeth and retreat their talons, not daring to harm.\"*\n\nMany doubt that **Confucianism and Daoism contradict each other** (*rúdào xiāng bèi*—**\n\nThe efficacy of the scripture can yet deliver one from beasts and dispel venomous karmic influences—how could those who recite it be like the *Lu* and *Qi* states, where poisonous vapors arise?\n\n**Chapter on Virtue and Power (续二十章):**\nIf in battle, when spears and halberds clash and blades interlock, one steadfastly retains the thought and silently recites this true scripture, all malevolent foes will retreat and disperse.\n\nThe benefits of this true scripture are not merely to dispel beasts, winds, and calamities! If in battle, when weapons are raised and spears and halberds clash, blades interlocking in the two armies’ confrontation, one steadfastly retains the thought and silently recites this true scripture—all the hostile foes assaulting our ranks will retreat and disperse.\n\n**Verification:**\nWeapons are instruments of slaughter. Battle is perilous. In the charge against enemies, arrows and stones fly, blades clash like roaring tigers—an irresolvable struggle. Yet if one steadfastly retains the thought and silently recites this true scripture, how, if one’s heart aligns with the Dao, could the malevolent foes not retreat?\n\nThe military classics say: *\"The morale of three armies can be undermined; the resolve of a general can be shattered.\"* Silently reciting the true scripture, one seizes their spirit and subdues their vitality. This wondrous scripture’s power causes the enemy to lose their resolve, abandoning their will to fight, turning from evil to good, and naturally withdrawing and scattering.\n\n\"Battle\" does not refer to armies numbering ten or twenty-five hundred—rather, when troops form ranks and confront one another in combat. \"Spear combat\" is not a matter of formal distinctions; \"clash\" and \"interlock\" differ little—only following the scripture’s phrasing of weapons meeting in battle. Steadfastly retaining the thought and silently reciting the true scripture is not for mere avoidance of slaughter—it is to devote one’s heart entirely, even facing death without abandoning the Dao.\n\n*\"All\"* means \"many.\" *\"Malevolent foes\"*—some interpret this as \"malevolent\" referring to evil persons, \"foes\" to bandits. This division is incorrect. It simply means hostile rebels.\n\n*\"Retreat and disperse\"* means to withdraw and return, to scatter and depart each to their own.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nThe Venerable Lord transformed in Hu, besieged by the army of Yutian. The Heavenly Sovereign resided in the Celestial Palace, while the Heavenly Demon raised arms to challenge. The Buddha dwelled in the realm of Magadha, where the six kings of Kāliṅga rebelled. Confucius transformed the world, felling trees in Chen and erasing his tracks in Song. These were all great sages.\n\nThe Dao-body, the Dharma-body—constantly turning the true scripture, observing as if assailed by foes. Later, the Venerable Lord radiated the Dao-light, and Yutian submitted. The Sovereign displayed the Heavenly Light, and the Heavenly Demon withdrew. The Buddha manifested the Dharma-light, and the six kings converted. Confucius shone with virtue-light, and when he thrice plucked his lute and thrice sang in harmony, the people of Qi laid down their arms.\n\nThus, they retreated and dispersed.\n\nYet consider that many foes have sworn never to harm the virtuous. Many virtuous have faced peril without dying. Some doubt the case of the Song emperors Huizong and Qinzong, who, though devoted to the Dao, suffered humiliation in the north; or Liang Wu, who, though fond of Buddhism, starved to death in the Tai City. They assume the scripture’s efficacy is unproven.\n\nYet the three rulers’ devotion to Dao and Buddhism was merely in name, not genuine.\n\n「When passions remain unsevered, one cannot govern the world with the Dao/Way, hence these calamities arise. If one truly embodies the Dao/Way and upholds faith in the scripture’s efficacy, even commoners—men and women alike—may avert such trials.\n\nTo doubt the deliverance from death and adversity or to disbelieve the scripture’s teachings is indeed erroneous. Alas, extolling unwavering integrity serves to inspire the world; reciting the scripture’s virtues stirs others to do good.\n\nIn essence, the scripture’s intent lies within the nature of our own inherent Dao/Way. When the six senses (六根) are assailed by thieves (贼) of discord, and one’s mind remains steadfast in the Dao/Way, the six thieves retreat. Thus, even in the face of armies, Heaven itself resolves the peril. Laozi proclaimed: *\"Armies cannot harm.\"* Guanyin declared: *\"The blade seeks only to sever flesh, yet justice prevails.\"* Their words are no deception—this is the natural efficacy of the scripture’s virtue.\n\n**Continuation of the *Merits and Virtues* (功德品) in Chapter 21:**\nIf one finds oneself imprisoned in shackles (枷锁), with a purified mind and settled thoughts, yet ever mindful of this scripture, wrongs shall be redressed and liberation attained. The scripture’s benefits extend far beyond dispersing bandits and armies—even if one has wrongfully incurred guilt and lies in chains, by keeping the heart and mind clear, steadfast in reciting this true scripture, wrongs shall naturally be revealed and deliverance achieved.\n\n**Verification:**\nPrisons exist to confine the guilty. The rewards of virtue and retribution for vice are the immutable laws of Heaven. Once imprisoned for a crime, one cannot simply escape—how then does it say that mindfulness of this scripture brings immediate liberation?\n\nThe phrase *\"wrongs shall be redressed\"* (冤枉自伸) implies that such a person, in their ordinary life, must inherently be virtuous. Perhaps in a past existence they incurred karmic debts (宿世充愆), or in this life they face misfortune (今生运限); or they may have been wrongfully accused (误失过失, 他人挂误), or drawn into another’s crime (先亡连逮, 救人被陷). When suddenly cast into prison, all such cases are unjust.\n\nIf one neither blames Heaven nor resents others, enduring hardship with equanimity (素患难, 行乎患难), free from malice or ill-will (绝无意想), then one’s mind is purified, thoughts settled, and devotion to this true scripture is genuine. Heaven aids the virtuous—wrongs are naturally exposed, requiring no defense, and justice is swiftly rendered. There is no prolonged suffering, for Heaven does not permit enduring injustice; liberation comes at once.\n\n**Definitions:**\nPrison (牢狱): *Lao* (牢) refers to confinement; *yù* (狱) refers to awaiting trial. Modern terms like *jianyáng* (监仓, prison cells) and *pùchǎng* (铺厂, detention centers) vary in severity, but both are places where criminals reside. The two characters do not strictly differentiate—*jiā* (枷) and *suǒ* (锁) are restraints for the guilty, arising from unforeseen circumstances (变故).\n\nSome say: *\"Lao\" derives from cattle (牛), \"yù\" from dogs (犬).* If one refrains from slaughtering cattle and dogs, prison shall be forever avoided. Yet this merely counsels against killing for sustenance (不食牛犬) and restrains the tongue (勿纵口), lest one invite calamity through gluttony (以味招祸).\n\nBeyond the scripture’s core teachings, this is an ancillary note.\n\nThe scripture’s benefits include redressing wrongs and granting liberation—not only for those unjustly imprisoned but also for those who, in ordinary life, have committed crimes yet repent sincerely, harboring no resentment. If one steadfastly relies on the scripture’s power, without faltering, liberation shall come.\n\nKing Wen of Zhou (文王) attained sainthood through the Dao/Way. Imprisoned in *Yǔlǐ* (羑里), he studied the *Yijing* (《易经》) and was pardoned. Gongye Chang (公冶长) aspired to the Dao/Way and became a sage. Though bound in chains (缧绁), he too found release. Xu Shen Gong (徐神公) and Zhang Ziyang (张紫阳) achieved transcendence through the Dao/Way. Despite the torments of *Chāngyì* (昌邑) imprisonment and the Three Refined Ones’ (三配) afflictions, their devoted practice of the supreme Dao/Way and profound transmission of *The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) secured their deliverance.\n\nIt is not only sages who are liberated—even the foolish, if they cast aside worldly attachments (除去维念), place absolute faith in this scripture, shall escape the bonds of prison. The misfortunes of *lao* and *yù* shall dissolve.\n\n**Dispelling Doubts:**\nIn the remote antiquity, there were no guilty criminals nor prisons. The Yellow Emperor (轩辕) captured *Chīyóu* (蚩尤), binding him with fetters (桎梏) and marking the earth to restrain him—thus the concept of prisons emerged. By the Three Dynasties (三代), the system of imprisonment was fully established.\n\nThis scripture was revealed before the age of great calamities (浩劫), when the Primordial Beginning (元始) spoke of it in Heaven. How then does it mention prisons? The truth is that in every age (劫劫), in every place, there are virtuous and wicked. The wicked naturally incur karmic retribution (孽), and the logic of prisons is already inherent.\n\nThe scripture encompasses all dharmas (万法), benefiting all sentient beings (群动) eternally. Its principles are exhaustive—it foretells the power to liberate from guilt.\n\nThe scripture declares: *\"Mindful of Guanyin’s power, chains shall swiftly depart.\"* Confucian texts say: *\"The virtuous man contemplates retribution.\"* The *Great Yijing* (《大易》) states: *\"No calamity comes without cause.\"* How could these not speak of prisons? Thus, the scripture is not a teaching of recent times—it is an ancient, profound revelation (无始玄章).\n\nIn summary, a single mindful thought aligns with virtue (福堂); a single thought of selfishness invites karmic bonds (业狱). If one’s desires and delusions persist unchecked, a pit of karmic debts is dug, and prison becomes inevitable.\n\nMencius said: *\"The difference between humans and beasts is but slight.\"* *Lao* (牢) derives from cattle (牛), *yù* (狱) from dogs (犬). The creator of these characters held deep meaning. Let all present and future beings exert effort and place unwavering faith in this scripture—through every age and place, prisons shall be forever avoided.\n\n**Continuation of the *Merits and Virtues* (功德品) in Chapter 22:**\nIf one is tormented by malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪精鬼贼), yet recites this true scripture in accordance with its methods, the malevolent shall flee, and one shall find peace.\n\nThe divine efficacy of the *Jade Scripture* (玉经) extends beyond liberating from prison—if one is afflicted by all manner of malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪魔精怪鬼贼), and recites this true scripture as prescribed, all malevolent spirits, demons, and thieves shall retreat and vanish, leaving one in natural security and tranquility.\n\n**Verification:**\n*\"If one is\"* (若为) is equivalent to *\"as one is\"* (如为). Malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪精鬼贼) encompass all that is not upright (不正)—spirits that exploit supernatural abilities to wreak havoc (通灵而逞妖异者为精), malevolent entities of the unseen realm (阴之灵者为鬼), and those that harm humans or things (伤人害物曰贼).\n\nSome say *\"贼\"* refers to human malefactors. Yet earlier it was stated that armies and wicked bandits (军阵恶贼) all disperse. How then could *\"贼\"* here mean human wrongdoers? Essentially, malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪魔妖精鬼怪) seize opportunities and exploit weaknesses, entering through the flaws of those who are not virtuous.\n\nTheir origins are unknown—from whence they come; their departures are unfathomable—whither they go. They strike in darkness, inflicting harm without warning, hence they are called *guǐzéi* (鬼贼, demonic thieves).」\n\nFrom the celestial *Tianmo* (天魔) down to earthly *tujing* (土精), mountain *wāngliang* (山魍魉), aquatic *shuàiyì* (水怪异), arboreal *mèi* (木魅) and metallic *jīng* (金精), fiery *yāo* (火妖) and herbaceous *yì* (草异), the *jing* (精) of birds and beasts, the anomalies of ice and embers (*bīngtàn zhī guài*), and the malevolent *chīniè* (魑孽) and spectral *guīlíng* (鬼灵)—these malevolent entities are countless.\n\nTheir afflictions manifest as hurling tiles and bricks, startling fowl and canines, demanding sacrifices, and disturbing households. They may cause one to be disoriented, spiritless and dazed, raving without cause, fleeing in lamentation, bewildered and insensible, capering and vomiting, roaring in lustful depravity, drunkenly deranged, losing one’s faculties, unable to rest or eat, perpetually anxious day and night—living in perpetual unrest, dying with lingering attachments. This is the suffering of *zhòngkǔ* (众苦).\n\n*\"Jiā\"* (加) means to inflict calamity upon others.\n\nIt is said: *\"As the law prescribes, recite this true scripture.\"* Yet if these malevolent spirits and *zhòngkǔ* (众苦) afflict one, how can simply reciting the scripture as prescribed dispel them?\n\n*\"As the law prescribes\"* does not mean mere ritual recitation—it is the unity of *yī* (一, singularity) with the mind and the Dao’s truth. When this scripture is chanted according to the proper method of recitation, with reverent gazing, bowing, and intoning, all malevolent spirits and thieves will retreat.\n\nAlternatively, it is said: *\"As the law prescrices, recite the true scripture\"*—meaning a Daoist practitioner should recite the scripture on behalf of the afflicted. Thus, all malevolent entities will retreat, and the afflicted will naturally find peace, without need for talismans, elixirs, or exorcistic incantations. Upon hearing the scripture, they will flee, and the suffering will cease, leaving none afflicted.\n\nIt is said that the Ancestor Celestial Master subdued all demons with the law. The *Xuandi* (玄帝) cultivated the True Way, annihilating all malevolent *jingyé* (精邪) and governing both human and ghostly realms. The *Sà Zhēnrén* (萨真人) expounded the Dao, banishing evil spirits. The *Lǎojūn* (老君) subdued the celestial demon. The *Fó Fàn* (佛梵) invoked spells to conquer demons.\n\nThe scholar-official *Fàn Wénzhènggōng* (范文正公), after a night on the battlefield, heard only the crowing of a rooster—no ghosts dared act malevolently. *Chéngzǐ* (程子) subdued the *Dàtóuguǐ* (大头鬼), and even when the ghosts moved his bed, his mind remained undisturbed, and the spirits withdrew in hiding.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the Dao is exalted, dragons and tigers submit;\nWhen virtue is profound, ghosts and spirits revere.\"*\n\nTo recite the true scripture as the law prescribes—this secret canon, the most sacred utterance—reveals the unbreakable mechanism by which ghosts and spirits are vanquished. How could any malevolent spirit or demonic thief dare not retreat?\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nEssentially, within the human body, the *sānshī* (三尸), *wǔqióng* (五穷), *qīpò* (七魄), the *qīqíng* (七情), and *liùyù* (六欲), along with all manner of delusive thoughts and fantasies, and the myriad dark inclinations—all are manifestations of malevolent spirits and thieves. If one awakens to the luminous void and wields the wisdom-sword to slay demons, exhausting all desires, then malevolent spirits and thieves will retreat.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Three of the *Gōngdé Pǐn* (功德品) – Continuation:**\n\nIf one seeks descendants, and reverently upholds and recites this scripture as the law prescribes, the Celestial Sovereign commands the *Tiāncháo* (天曹), who then inspect the *Dānjí* (丹籍) of the Nine Ranks. Among the *sìguǒ xiānrén* (四果仙人), when fate and destiny align, they descend and incarnate to become their child—endowed with eloquence, wisdom, and noble status among mortals.\n\nThe efficacy of this scripture is not merely to subdue malevolent forces. If one, afflicted by childlessness, seeks descendants and upholds this scripture with reverence as prescribed, the Celestial Sovereign commands the *Tiāncháo* to examine the *Dānshū Xiānjí* (丹书仙籍). Among the Nine Ranks, the *sìguǒ xiānrén* (四果仙人), when their cosmic cycles and numerical destinies converge, descend and incarnate to become their child.\n\nThe child born to one who recites this scripture for descendants will be gifted with eloquence, wisdom, and intelligence, attaining noble status among humanity.\n\n*\"Qí\"* (祈) means to pray and supplicate the gods in seeking.\n\nSometimes, others pray for one; other times, one seeks for oneself. Whether one has descendants or not depends on Heaven’s decree—if it cannot be sought, it cannot be sought. Of the three gravest offenses against filial piety, childlessness is the greatest. One must seek descendants, for all who possess *xuèqì* (血气) are capable of procreation.\n\nPerhaps one has exhausted *yīndé* (阴德) or incurred Heaven’s wrath; perhaps one’s *yáng* (阳) and *yīn* (阴) are misaligned, or one’s fate clashes with solitude; perhaps the fetus is weak or one harms oneself in anger, resulting in childlessness.\n\nYet human resolve can reverse Heaven’s decree—through utmost sincerity and divine resonance, none will remain childless. Thus, descendants can be sought.\n\n*\"Sìxī\"* (嗣息) means *\"sì\"* (嗣, to continue) and *\"xī\"* (息, breath). Some say *\"sì\"* means to bind, as in binding the ancestral line like a continuous thread. Others say *\"sì\"* means to govern, overseeing the transmission of family lineage, as recorded in ancestral tablets. *\"Xī\"* (息) refers to children who continue the ancestral line, like the unceasing inhalation and exhalation of breath.\n\nMoreover, the true breath is the root of life and death—if breath ceases, *qì* (气) vanishes. Having descendants ensures the continuity of sacrifices, hence *\"xī\"* (息). *\"Tàidǐ xī\"* (太抵息) refers to the mind itself. With descendants, all concerns are fulfilled, and the mind finds rest—thus it is called *\"xī\"* (息).\n\nThe sages of the Three Teachings all had descendants. How can one not recognize the weight of progeny?\n\nTo uphold this scripture with reverence is to revere the scripture itself. Some say one must personally revere it—which is incorrect. The *Tiāncháo* are those who create destinies and oversee the *Xiānjí* (仙籍). The Nine Ranks consist of the upper three *shèng* (乘), the middle three, and the lower three—totaling nine.\n\nThe *Shìjìng* (释经) states: *\"The Nine-Ranked Lotus is the parent.\"* The Buddha, Bodhisattvas, *Yuánjué* (圆觉), *Shèngwén* (声闻), and *Āluóhàn* (阿罗汉), as well as those in the four *zhān* (禅) stages, also belong to the Nine Ranks.\n\nThe *sìguǒ xiānrén* (四果仙人)—*Xūduōhàn* (须陀洹), *Sītuǒhán* (斯陀含), *Āluóhàn* (阿罗汉), and *Ānàhàn* (阿那含)—descend and incarnate. For the Daoist or Buddhist to take human form is considered descending to the mortal realm, hence *\"jiàngdié xiàshēng\"* (降谪下生).\n\n*\"Cái\"* (才) refers to extraordinary talents; *\"biàn\"* (辩) refers to unparalleled eloquence.\n\nThe light shines without failing.\nThe wisdom awakens without obstruction.\n\nAmong mortals, the most honored are not necessarily those who become rulers, ministers, or teachers—\nbut those who embody **virtue** and the **Way**, perfecting themselves as exemplary sons.\nNo greater honor than the **Way**,\nNo greater nobility than **virtue**.\nEven the Son of Heaven cannot make them his subject,\nNor can the feudal lords make them their friend.\nThey assist in governance, nurture the people,\nAnd aid in the completion of all things.\nAcross countless generations, they are revered,\nAnd across the Three Realms, they are held in esteem.\nThus, they are the most honored among mortals.\n\nIf one reveres this **sutra** as law,\nReciting it for oneself or seeking descendants through it,\nThough its effects are manifest, one cannot reckon the days—\nOnly by truly honoring the **sutra**,\nConfessing faults with sincerity,\nAnd remaining steadfast from beginning to end,\nAs though gazing upon the Jade Emperor,\nWith utmost reverence for this sacred **dharma**,\nWill divine efficacy and spiritual power unfold unseen,\nTurning fate and altering destiny—\nDescendants will naturally arise.\n\nEven mortal heroes gain offspring through merit.\nThose who truly believe in the **sutra** and turn the **Dharma Wheel**,\nAs the functional pillars of heaven and earth,\nHow could their descendants not prosper?\nIf one reveres this **sutra** yet fails to secure descendants,\nIt must be that their sincerity is insufficient,\nOr they have not followed the **sutra** from start to finish.\n\nLet all mortals take heed and verify the **sutra’s** divine efficacy.\n\n**Functional Merit Chapter (Continuation, Twenty-Fourth Section):**\nIf a woman in her critical month of childbirth\nRecites this true **sutra** according to the law,\nShe will give birth safely, mother and child both unharmed,\nAnd bear children of fortune and **virtue**, beloved and respected by all.\n\nThe **sutra’s** divine power does more than merely ensure descendants.\nIf a woman in her critical month of childbirth\nRecites this true **sutra** according to the law,\nShe will deliver swiftly and safely,\nMother and child both unscathed,\nAnd bear children of auspicious fortune and **virtue**, beloved and honored by all.\n\nOnce a woman is married into her husband’s family, she is called a **wife**.\nThe \"critical month\" refers to the time of childbirth,\nWhen life and death hang in the balance—\nThus, it is called \"facing peril.\"\nReciting the true **sutra** according to the law:\nWhether before birth, when she herself observes a pure fast and recites the **sutra**,\nOr during birth, when others recite it for her,\nShe will deliver safely,\nWith no complications at the hour of birth,\nThe child born without harm to mother or child,\nBoth emerging smoothly and in good health—\nA benefit to both.\n\n**Fortune** refers to those of wealth, nobility, longevity, and auspicious appearance.\n**Virtue** refers to the saintly, loyal, filial, and kind—those of moral excellence.\n**Children**, whether male or female, bear **fortune** and **virtue**.\n**Beloved and respected** means they are approachable yet not familiar,\nNear yet not to be trifled with—\nAll draw near to them, praise them, and envy them.\nThis is called **love**.\nYet, when seen from afar, reverence arises;\nWhen approached, laziness fades;\nWithout words, trust is given;\nWithout movement, respect is shown.\nThis is called **respect**.\n\n**Clarification:**\nIt is fitting for a man to be beloved and respected.\nBut how can a woman be so?\nIf her **fortune** is complete and her conduct virtuous,\nIf she does not weep or jest,\nIf she is dignified, speaks little,\nMoves seldom, and does not laugh,\nIf she is mature beyond her years,\nGrave yet pure in adulthood,\nAnd unchanging until death—\nAll will love her as kin,\nRespect her as elders.\nThis love is without familiarity;\nThey envy her **fortune** and **virtue**—\nA rarity in the world.\n\n**Verification:**\nMother and child both safe.\n\nThe *Shijing*’s chapter *\"Shēngmín\"* praises Jiāng Yù in giving birth to Hòuxī, saying:\n*\"The firstborn was born like a strike—no calamity, no harm.\"*\nJiāng Yù possessed **virtue**, so her firstborn emerged as easily as a lamb—unharmed, with mother and child both at peace.\nThe *Exegesis* states: *\"Mother and child parted early.\"*\nThe *Dao Scriptures* declare: *\"At childbirth, there is joy; seated on grass, there is no peril.\"*\nThe merit of reciting the *Scriptures* responds like an echo.\n\nNow, the *Huángjīng* spreads throughout the world, and many recite it.\nYet women in childbirth may suffer:\nSome deliver prematurely before their time,\nSome face calamity or peril,\nSome encounter ghostly births or omens,\nSome endure misfortune or familial strife—\nThough many achieve mother and child’s safety, few attain both fully;\nSome suffer dual harm as well.\n\nSome say reciting the *Scriptures* may bring no benefit,\nYet the True Law is rare to encounter.\nMany do not revere this *Scripture* or know its blessings;\nSome hear its name but do not honor it;\nSome pay hollow respect without recitation,\nSome recite but begin with fervor and end in neglect;\nSome omit or confuse passages,\nSome recite carelessly, mispronouncing words, distorting phrases,\nMisinterpreting meaning—\nThough they may offer repentance, they fail to gain the full merit of the *Scripture*.\nAll these are self-deception, failing to meet the *Scripture*’s power,\nThus concluding that recitation is fruitless—\nThis is blasphemy against the Law.\n\nAlas, the True Law must be upheld,\nAnd filial piety is hard to repay.\nRescuing suffering, benefiting life—\nThis is the urgent duty of those who seek the *Way*.\nIf we teach the world to revere and recite this *Scripture*,\nThen mothers and children will be at peace,\nChildbirth perils will be averted,\nAnd virtuous sons and daughters will be born—\nAll will bear marks of **fortune** and **virtue**,\nAnd the True *Dao* will endure forever.\nThe merit is boundless.\n\nLet those who study the *Scripture* take heed.\n\n**End of Volume Six of *Huángjīng* Annotations**\n**Volume Seven of *Huángjīng* Annotations**\nVerified by the

grandchildren,\nenjoying wealth, security, and prestige,\nilluminating ancestors and benefiting posterity—\nboth honored and prosperous, enduring through the ages.\nThough not equal to the heavens and earth in permanence,\nthey endure eternally, blessing future generations,\nwith grace extending unbroken.\nEven across many generations, this is considered enduring.\n\nAs with **Confucius the Sage’s** supreme virtue,\nor the **Celestial Master’s** divine transformations,\nhis descendants received imperial appointments through the ages—\nthis is true, unbroken honor and rank.\n\n**Titles and stipends** originate from the imperial court’s official appointments.\nIf they cannot be obtained through merit,\none may follow established qualifications for advancement.\nIf advancement is unattainable through merit,\nhow much more so must one study diligently—\nscholars must master texts, warriors must know warfare.\nLearning and achievements cannot be borrowed;\nhow then can one seek advancement?\n\nOfficials are appointed for their virtue,\nand stipends are granted to nourish the worthy.\nThose of great virtue must attain their rightful position and name.\nIf one upholds this *True Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,\nrecites its sacred words,\nand follows the Sage’s teachings,\none’s heart aligns with the heavens,\nand one’s actions harmonize with the *Way*—\nthis is the mark of a truly virtuous person.\n\nSome are praised in speech,\nothers commended in deed;\nwithout titles, they are granted offices,\nwithout rank, they receive stipends,\nor their existing offices are elevated—\nthis is the natural course of employing the worthy.\n\nBy virtue, one attracts the worthy.\nIf they refuse such honors—\nas **Broad Achievement**, **Yin Shou**, **Chao You**, or **Yan Guang**—\nwhether as imperial preceptors or honored guests of the state,\nhow can it be said that the virtuous cannot attain titles and stipends?\nAs with **Han’s Zhuge Liang**,\nor **Jin-Tang’s Jingyang, Li Bei, and Hai Dan**,\nall were men of the *Way* who held office.\n\nThe *Scripture* speaks of seeking office—\nwhat more need be said?\n\n**Heavenly Titles** are noble indeed,\nand they belong to us inherently.\nAscending beyond the mundane to sainthood,\nadvancing in virtue step by step,\nmanifesting divine transformations to attain immortality—\nthis is unbroken through kalpas.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"To die yet not perish.\"*\nThe *Transmissions of the Immortals* declare:\n*\"A child is born, and the child bears grandchildren.\"*\n\nThe *Way* is exalted, virtue is noble,\nand the transmissions of the immortals are boundless.\nIf one does not covet worldly fame or transient gain,\nbut cultivates the **Heavenly Title’s** true nobility,\ntranscending the ordinary to approach sainthood,\nrising above the dust to attain immortality—\nenduring forever without end,\nthis is truly to uphold the *True Scripture* in accordance with its precepts.\n\n---\n**Continuation of Chapter Twenty-Six: The Merit of Wealth**\n\nIf one desires to amass abundant wealth,\nand upholds this *True Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,\nthen treasures shall overflow,\nclothing and food shall come naturally,\nand blessings shall flow to descendants,\npassing to future generations.\n\nThe benefits of this *Scripture* extend far beyond fulfilling worldly ambitions for office!\nIf one desires abundant wealth for one’s family,\nand upholds this *True Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,\nthen riches, treasures, and precious curiosities shall fill to overflowing,\nclothing and food shall be plentiful and refined,\nnaturally abundant without effort,\nwith blessings extending to descendants,\npassing to future generations.\n\n**Wealth:**\n*Resource*—what one’s family requires.\n*Alternatively:* That which one relies upon, benefiting all.\nSame as *capital*.\n**Treasures:**\n*Wealth*—the wealth one possesses.\n*Also:* Wealth as a resource.\n**Abundant:**\n*Yin*—fullness, completeness.\n**Rich:**\nWhen a household’s prosperity reaches its peak,\nand resources are fully sufficient.\n**Uphold:**\n*Delight in reverence* is *uphold*;\nto guard, observe, and recite.\n**Treasures:**\n*Wealth*—the *wealth* of goods.\n*Precious*—jade, gold, silver, gems, rare curiosities,\nornaments, silks, and treasures of extraordinary value.\n**Overflowing:**\n*Chong*—fully sufficient.\n*Yi*—abundantly full.\n**Clothing and food naturally:**\nWithout toil, naturally abundant.\n**Blessings flow to descendants:**\n*Reg* signifies auspiciousness.\nGrace extends far, blessing generation after generation—\nthus, *blessings flow to descendants*.\n**Passing to future generations:**\nNot limited to one’s own children,\nbut transmitted through the ages,\nwith later generations eternally enjoying peace and honor.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\n**Confucius** said:\n*\"Wealth, if it can be sought, even a lowly driver I would serve.\"*\nIf it cannot be sought, then follow what one loves.\nHe strongly states that wealth is not to be pursued—\nyet here it is said that if one seeks abundance by upholding this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,\none shall attain prosperity and blessings for descendants.\nThis suggests that wealth *can* be sought.\n\n**Zi Xia** said:\n*\"The Master heard: Wealth and nobility are decreed by Heaven.\"*\nThough wealth is desirable, fate governs it,\nand Heaven truly holds dominion—\nhow then can it be sought?\nYet though wealth is subject to fate,\nthe ancient scholars said:\n*\"Wealth and nobility are the rewards for virtue’s culmination,\na repayment for merit.\"*\n\nIf one upholds and recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,\nspeaking the words of Heaven with reverence as though addressing the August Sky,\nthis is how virtue earns its blessings.\n\n「The *Classics* say: *\"Joy belongs to the virtuous gentleman,\nblessings follow those who tread the peaceful Way.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nSome say: *\"Great Yu was a sage,\nwho drank little and ate plainly,\nwore coarse garments and lived in humble dwellings,\nyet found sweetness only in simplicity and restraint.\"*\nThe Daoist teachings state: *\"To learn the Dao, one must embrace poverty to the marrow of the bones.\"*\nThis suggests that reciting the *Scripture* can bring wealth—\na claim that may entice those who crave prosperity.\n\nYu’s own frugality was the heart of a sage who did not hoard virtue for himself.\nThe Daoists’ pursuit of poverty was to free the mind from worldly burdens.\nThough wealth *can* be sought and obtained,\nthis is the intended effect of upholding the *Scripture*.\n\nThe *Buddha’s Scriptures* say: *\"All that one seeks with sincere intent\nshall be fulfilled and satisfied.\"*\nBoth teachings open vast pathways of expedience—\nboundless blessings and benefits,\nwhere requests are answered and wishes fulfilled.\nIf one doubts, hesitates, or falters—\nbeginning with diligence yet ending in neglect—\nif one’s heart is not upright,\nlacks steadfast faith, or is not utterly sincere,\nthen even seeking shall yield no result.\nLet those who observe the *Scripture* understand this well.\n\nConsider: all things are inherently complete within me.\nThere are those who are naturally wealthy without effort.\nYet why do people chase after fame and gain,\ncompete in superficial luxuries,\nindulge in passions and desires,\nand mistake falsehood for truth?\n\nThe poor suffer in distress,\nyet cannot uphold the Great Way,\nnor recite the true *Scriptures*.\nThe rich indulge in extravagance,\nyet cannot abandon worldly wisdom and profit\nto follow the teachings of the Law,\nwilling to age and die in their folly,\nlosing the wealth they were born with.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Gold and jade fill the hall,\nyet none can guard them;\nwealth and rank bring arrogance,\nand one invites ruin upon oneself.\"*\nThis warns against pursuing externals while neglecting the inner self.\n\nNow it is said that reciting the *Scripture* can bring wealth—\nto urge people to abandon their superficial pursuit of riches\nand instead honor the *Scripture*.\nAh, truly, reciting the *Scripture* has its effect.\nIf one lacks sincerity and reverence,\none may only invite transgression.\nLet those who observe the *Scripture* be cautious.\n\n**Chapter 27 of *The Merits and Virtues* (continued):**\nIf one is afflicted by malevolent stars,\nsuffering hardship in life and death,\nand yet recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,\nthen these malevolent stars shall retreat,\nbringing forth auspicious fortune instead.\n\nThe benefits of this *Scripture* extend far beyond mere wealth—\nif one’s life or fate is troubled by malevolent stars,\nif one lies in bed with restless sleep,\nand yet recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,\nthen these malevolent stars shall transform their ill fortune into good,\nand retreat, bringing forth auspicious fortune.\n\nThe Master **Chisongzi** said: *\"The people are orphaned and destitute,\neach bearing a star upon their brow.\"*\nYet the stars that shine upon them bring either fortune or calamity—\nfortune brings a thousand blessings,\nwhile calamity portends ill omens and punishments.\nThose beneath the Three Luminaries must always avoid such ill influences.\nMalevolent stars are the stars of calamity—\nsuch as **Luohe** (羅睺), **Jidu** (計都), **Tianpo** (天破), **Tianku** (天哭), **Tianbai** (天敗), and **Tianrui** (天退), among others.\n\n**Photo** (照) refers to when stars align with one’s destiny,\nfate, or home—whether at birth, during one’s lifespan,\nor in the celestial divisions of one’s abode.\n**Kun** (困) means one’s desires are not fulfilled,\npressed down and unable to flourish.\n**Ku** (苦) refers to poverty, illness, or danger\nthat directly afflicts the body.\n**Kun and ku in bed and pillow** simply mean\none is trapped in misfortune,\nunable to rest or sleep in peace,\nlying in bed with no comfort.\n\nAnother saying: *\"Bed and pillow are disturbed by fear.\"*\nThese malevolent stars encompass many—\nall celestial omens of calamity that align with one’s destiny,\nfate, or home, and all stars of ill fortune.\n\n**Returning and descending auspicious fortune** means\nthat when malevolent stars shine upon one,\nmisfortune prevails and no blessings follow.\nYet if one recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,\nthe sacred verses shall take effect,\nthe ill omens shall become auspicious,\nand all malevolent stars that afflict one\nshall not only fail to bring misfortune,\nbut shall instead withdraw in silence,\nbestowing blessings and fortune,\nand descending auspicious fortune.\n\nThe influence of stars upon destiny and fate\nis inherently fixed.\nHow then can reciting the *Scripture* cause malevolent stars to bring auspicious fortune?\n\nHeaven and humanity share the same principle—\nabove and below are interconnected,\nand the mechanism of response is swift as light and shadow.\nKing **Shuanggong of Song** had three sayings of a ruler,\none of which was: *\"Retreat when the star **Yinghuo** (荧惑) appears.\"*\n\nIt is not only rulers who can move Heaven—\na filial wife, bearing grief, could bring three years of drought;\na lowly servant, pleading sincerely, could summon frost in the sixth month.\nEven common folk, man or woman,\ncan sway Heaven and Earth,\nand stir the spirits and deities—\nonly fearing their sincerity may not be complete.\n\nIf one’s sincerity reaches Heaven,\neven a single word can win the trust of the divine.\nOne need not speak to influence the transformations of fate—\nhow much more so when the *Scripture* is the essence of Heaven and Earth,\nthe source from which the Three Luminaries draw their light?\n\nIf one recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,\nhonoring the sacred verses of the Most Holy,\nand fully embracing the profound mysteries of the enlightened,\nthen malevolent stars shall disperse,\nauspicious fortune shall arise,\nand ill fate shall turn to blessing.\n\nHumans are all the same—\nthose who follow the path of virtue shall meet fortune,\nthose who oppose it shall meet calamity.\n*The *Central Admonition Scripture* (中诫经)* says:\n*\"When stars shine upon a person,\nfortune or calamity is self-summoned—\ndoing great good, the star’s light shall be manifest;\ndoing no good nor evil, its light shall be faint;\ncommitting minor faults, its light shall scatter;\ncommitting great faults, its light shall vanish.\nIf malevolent stars afflict one,\nit is because of one’s faults—\nthen ill fate shall respond.\nIf one is faultless,\nthe omens shall be averted.\nGoodness shall drive away calamity,\nand blessings shall descend.\"*\n\nThe *Scripture* says: *\"A single thought of evil\nsummons malevolent stars and vengeful spirits;\na single thought of good\nsummons auspicious stars and joyous clouds.\"*\nThe signs of blessing or ruin\ndepend upon the purity of one’s thoughts.\n\nEven in times of great peril and disaster,\nif one truly upholds this *Scripture*,\nthe calamities shall retreat—\nand yet, are there not some afflictions,\nlike restless sleep and sudden misfortunes,\nthat may not be entirely dispelled?\n\nKing **Tai Jia** said: *\"Heaven creates calamities,\nyet they can still be defied.\"*\nThis is the same meaning.\n\nIf one can propagate the Dao,\npraise the nurturing of all things,\nand silently turn the true *Scripture*,\nentering its divine mysteries to reach cosmic transformation,\nthen one shall align with Heaven and Earth in virtue,\nwith the sun and moon in radiance,\nwith the four seasons in order,\nand with the spirits and deities in fortune and calamity.\nOne shall guide the transformations of fate,\nforever transcend the mundane,\nand even the spirits and deities shall not dare to obstruct—\nlife and death shall have no dominion,\nand stars shall not be able to confine or limit one.\n\nLet those who observe this *Scripture* strive earnestly.\n\n**Chapter 28 of *The Merits and Virtues* (continued):**\nIf one’s fate is marked by transgressions,\nand they should fall into the hells,\ntheir names recorded in the evil ledgers,\nthen let their parents, teachers, and elders,\ntheir spouses and children,\nrecite this *Scripture* for them,\nor establish a Daoist hall for their repose,\noffering banners, flowers, and provisions.\nThus shall the departed’s evil record be erased,\ntheir spirit reborn in a pure land,\nand all suffering beings be liberated together,\nreceiving this triumphant blessing—\nall shall ascend to Heaven above.»\n\nThe merits and virtues of this *Scripture* do not merely avert sins in life—\nif one’s fate is marked by transgressions and they die prematurely,\ntheir soul and spirit shall descend into the hells,\ntheir names recorded in the ledgers of evil deeds.\nThen let their parents, teachers, and elders,\ntheir spouses and children,\nrecite this *Scripture* for the departed,\nor establish a *Dao* hall for their liberation,\noffering banners, flowers, and provisions.\nThus shall the departed’s evil records be erased,\ntheir spirit reborn in a pure land,\nand all who suffer in the same hells, the same deaths,\nthe same ledgers of sin—\nall shall rely on the *Scripture*’s virtue,\nreceiving deliverance and salvation,\nand attain this supreme and wondrous *Law*’s blessings,\nascending to Heaven above.\n\n*\"Command over\"* (*命过*)—this means dying before one’s allotted lifespan.\n*\"Descend into the hells\"* (*应入地狱*)—whether from sins committed in past lives or this one,\none must enter the hells and suffer retribution.\nThe hells include *Yingdu* (酆都), *Iron Enclosure* (铁围), the *Nine Hells*, the *Eighteen Hells*,\nthe *Twenty-Four Hells*, the *Thirty-Six Hells*, the *Seventy-Two Hells*,\nand the *Hell of No Return* (无间), among others.\n\n*\"Recorded in the ledgers of evil\"* (*注名恶籍*)—their names are inscribed\nin the black registers of misdeeds for retribution.\n*\"Parents, teachers, and elders\"* (*父母师长*)—these are the departed’s parents,\ntheir masters, or their senior kin.\n*\"Spouses and children\"* (*夫妻男女*)—whether the departed was a woman or a man,\nthey must have had a husband or wife;\nif not, then their sons, daughters, or other male and female relatives remain.\n*\"Recite this Scripture for the departed\"* (*当为亡人持念是经*)—this is for the living kin\nto uphold and chant this *Scripture* on their behalf.\n*\"Establish a Dao hall\"* (*或安置道场*)—to arrange and consecrate a *Dao* hall,\nfollowing the *Dao*’s methods to eliminate karmic sins—hence, a *Dao* hall.\n*\"Banners and floral offerings\"* (*旛花供养*)—the *banner* (*旛*) proclaims the sacred names endlessly,\ninscribed on long scrolls, hoisted on tall poles to sway the four directions,\nspreading radiant light. *Flowers* (*花*) are presented—all rare blooms—to welcome the sacred spirits.\nIn Heaven, natural banners and flags unfurl, celestial flowers bloom in splendor,\ndisplaying auspicious light. In the mortal world, banners are placed in the *Dao* hall\nto signify solemnity and invite divine aid.\n*\"Provisions\"* (*供养*)—*supply* (*供*) means to offer reverently;\n*nourish* (*养*) means to provide food and drink in veneration.\nHeavenly beings feast on pure and wondrous *Law*—the celestial kitchen’s refined offerings,\nsolemn and respectful. The world’s five or ten offerings\nmerely eliminate the five aggregates, remove five sufferings,\nrestrain five pleasures, abandon ten evils,\ncontemplate ten truths, and dwell in ten virtues—\nto honor the luminous spirits,\nrevere the true *Law*,\nand uphold sacred texts—this is true veneration.\nYet today, offering only food, flowers, fruits, and rare delicacies\nwithout genuine reverence is but superficial.\nThe *Scripture*’s true offerings are those of sincere, natural devotion.\n\nThus shall the departed’s evil records be erased,\ntheir spirit reborn in a pure land.\nA single turning of this *Scripture*,\nor the establishment of a *Dao* hall,\nshall free the departed from the netherworld,\nerase their black karmic deeds,\nand remove their names from the ledgers of sin—\ntheir spirit reborn in a land of purity and bliss.\nAll who suffer in the same hells shall be liberated,\nrelying on the *Scripture*’s compassionate salvation.\nAll shall ascend to Heaven above through this supreme blessing.\n\n*\"Command over\"* (*命过*)—though Heaven’s blessings may be finite,\na single recitation of this true *Scripture*,\nor the establishment of a *Dao* hall,\nshall erase the departed’s sins and those of all suffering spirits in the hells,\ngranting them birth in Heaven.\nIf practiced eternally, what limit shall its merits have?\n\nAlas! The hells have no gates—only one invites themself.\nThe Celestial Realm has paths—yet the ignorant struggle to walk them.\nHow much more so for those born with innate purity,\nthe *Scripture of the Imperial True One*—\nif they perpetually uphold and recite it,\nthe hells and heavens shall never stain them,\neternally attaining the Mysterious True.\n\nThus it is said of those who well uphold this *Scripture*.\n\n**Chapter 29 of *The Merits and Virtues* (continued):**\nWherever this *Scripture* resides,\nthe *Ten Heavenly Supreme True Saints* and the *Limitless Flying Heavenly Kings*\nshall attend in reverence, offering protection.\nThose who uphold this *Scripture* may rightly call themselves *Zhengyi True Persons*.\nWherever such a person dwells,\nthe *Ten Directions’ Supreme True Saints* and *Golden-Armed Vajra Warriors*\nshall secretly guard them as their own body.\nWhether in travel or repose,\nall malevolent forces shall flee their path,\ndemons shall be exterminated,\nspirits shall hide in submission,\nand no calamity shall dare approach them.\n\nWhen such a person’s life nears its end,\nthey shall not see the horrors of the hells—\ninstead, they shall behold Heavenly Maidens of Jade bearing flags to welcome them,\nand ascend to Heaven above.\n\nIf their Heavenly blessings are exhausted and they return to the mortal realm,\nthey shall, across countless lifetimes,\nalways be reborn as kings, ministers,\nsage rulers, and virtuous officials,\ngathering in assemblies of the enlightened—\ntheir lands peaceful, their people at ease in righteousness,\ntheir innate nature ever luminous.\nBy following the Great *Dao*,\nthey shall progressively cultivate,\nultimately attaining the Dao’s shore.\n\nSuch are the blessings bestowed upon those who uphold this *Scripture*.\nThe *Scripture*’s merits do not merely benefit life and death—\nwherever this *Scripture* resides,\nthe *Ten Heavenly Supreme True Saints* and the *Limitless Flying Heavenly Kings*\nshall attend in reverence, offering protection.\nThose who uphold this *Scripture* may rightly call themselves *Zhengyi True Persons*.\nWherever such a person dwells,\nthe *Ten

they shall behold Heavenly Officials and Jade Maidens bearing flags and banners to welcome them,\nand ascend to Heaven above.\n\nIf their Heavenly blessings are exhausted and they return to the mortal realm,\nthey shall, across countless lifetimes,\nalways be reborn as kings, ministers,\nsage rulers, and virtuous officials,\ngathering in assemblies of the enlightened—\ntheir lands peaceful, their people at ease in righteousness,\ntheir innate nature ever luminous.\nBy following the Great *Dao*,\nthey shall progressively cultivate,\nultimately attaining the Dao’s shore.\n\nSuch is the fortune bestowed upon the *sutra*-holder.\n\nThe Ten Heavens, the Ten Directions, and all the Celestial Kings—\nthe Flying Celestial Kings, who are the Celestial Kings that traverse the skies in flight and guard the heavens.\nThey stand in attendance, bowing to shield them.\n\nThe *Zhengyi* True Person, one who is upright and unselfish, true and undivided.\nThe *Jin Gang* Powerful Ones, the guardians of both teachings—\nall come to protect the *sutra*-holder.\n\nIn secret, they guard them,\nprotecting them unseen,\nas though safeguarding their own luminous essence—\none can perceive the fervor of the gods’ protection.\n\nWherever such a person goes—\nwhether they emerge or retreat—\nall malevolent demons, spirits, and *qi*-bound entities\nflee, hide, or submit in fear.\nThey are utterly exterminated and removed.\n\n*Exterminated*—meaning cut off, utterly spent.\nCalamities and misfortunes cannot draw near.\n\nWhen this person’s life draws to its end,\nthey shall not behold the myriad horrors of the hells.\n\nThe Heavenly Palace Maidens—\na variant reading mistakenly says *Heavenly Officials*—\nare not the same.\nThe *zhang* (great banner of the *Dao*), not a *fan* (military flag) nor a *jing* (ceremonial standard),\nis the banner of the Great *Dao*.\nThey descend to escort and guide them upward to Heaven.\n\nAcross countless lifetimes,\nthey shall be reborn as kings and ministers,\nalways held in honor,\nlike the Buddha’s eight thousand descendants as royal princes,\nor the *Xuandi* Emperor ruling for a thousand lifetimes,\nor a thousand lifetimes as a prime minister,\nor the *Laojun* (Venerable Master) throughout the kalpas as the sovereign teacher of emperors and kings.\n\nTogether, they ensure enduring peace and joy,\nwhile their innate luminous nature remains unobscured—\ngreat wisdom and great insight,\nnever dimmed by the virtuous causes of past kalpas.\n\nThey uphold and revere the Great *Dao*,\nrepeatedly cultivating and refining,\nprogressively practicing and attaining,\nuntil they reach the *Dao*’s shore.\n\nThe *Dao*’s shore—meaning attainment of the *Dao*,\nas crossing to the opposite shore of the sea.\nThe Buddha spoke of \"reaching the other shore.\"\nThe *Great Odes* say: *\"They first ascend to the shore.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nOne variant says: *the shore of return*.\n\nThe merit of reciting the *sutra* brings benefit at every moment—\nwhether aiding the living or the dead,\nwhether few or many,\nwhether near or distant,\nall wishes fulfilled,\ntruly manifesting the power of transformation.\n\nOr over countless lifetimes,\nunwavering in devotion,\nrepeatedly cultivating and refining,\nonly then ascending to the *Dao*’s shore.\n\nThus, the attainment of great perfection is truly arduous.\nThose who observe the *sutra* with resolute intent\nmay enter the highest echelon.\n\n**Chapter 30: The Merits of the *Sutra***\n\nIf one recites this *sutra* when rain falls,\narousing great compassion,\nand as prescribed, recites the three volumes of this *sutra* toward the void,\nall beings touched by the rain,\nin the direction of their faces,\nwhether committing the five heinous offenses, ten evils,\nor any grave sins—\nall are utterly eradicated.\nAll severe illnesses are spontaneously cured.\n\nUpon their death,\nthese beings shall not fall into hell,\nbut be reborn in pure lands,\nemerging from lotus flowers.\nHow much more so for those who recite this *sutra* themselves!\n\nIf one recites this *sutra* while traveling,\nand a great wind arises, blowing against the reciter,\nthe dust touching their body—\nwherever that dust settles,\nall beings’ evil deeds are utterly destroyed,\nand they shall not fall into the three evil paths,\ninstead being reborn in heaven.\n\nThus, the merit of reciting the *sutra* is unfathomable.\nIts virtue extends beyond benefiting oneself alone.\n\nIf one recites this *sutra* when rain falls,\narousing great compassion to save the world,\nand as prescribed, recites the upper, middle, and lower volumes of this *sutra* completely,\nall beings touched by the rain,\nin the direction of their faces—\nwhether committing the five heinous offenses, ten evils,\nor any grave sins—\nall are utterly dispersed and annihilated.\nAll severe illnesses are spontaneously cured and healed.\n\nThese beings in the direction of the reciter’s face,\nupon death,\nshall not fall into hell,\nbut be reborn in pure lands,\nuntainted by defilement,\nemerging from lotus flowers.\nHow then can the merit of those who recite this *sutra* be measured?\n\nIf one recites this *sutra* while traveling,\nand a great wind arises, blowing against the reciter,\nthe dust touching their body—\nwherever that dust settles,\nall beings’ evil deeds are utterly destroyed,\nand they shall not fall into the three evil paths,\ninstead being reborn in heaven.\n\nThus, the merit of reciting the *sutra* is unfathomable.\n\n**Explication of Doubts:**\nThe reciter’s compassion knows no bounds—\nnot only when rain falls or wind rises,\nbut with great compassion at all times.\nThis speaks to the efficacy of reciting the *sutra*.\nGreat compassion and pity extend to all beings in the world.\n\nThe *Release Teachings* say: *\"A mother’s heart is too tender.\"*\nThe *Odes* say: *\"Alas, this one alone is honored.\"*\nIt also says: *\"Pity cannot perfect a person.\"*\nThe *Dao* scriptures say: *\"Great compassion awakens the world.\"*\nThe reciter pities the suffering of worldly beings,\nthus arousing great compassion.\n\nThe five heinous offenses:\ndisloyalty, unfilial piety, lack of kindness, discord, and injustice.\nOr: disrespect for heaven, earth, sovereign, parents, and teachers;\ndisrespect for the Three Jewels;\nfailure to uphold precepts;\nlack of moral cultivation;\nand ignorance of true nature.\n\nThe ten evils:\nkilling, stealing, sexual misconduct, deceit,\nslanderous speech, false speech, flattery,\nharsh words, greed, anger, and delusion.\n\nAll severe illnesses are cured.\n*Syuan* (痊): restored to ease.\n*Yu* (愈): fully healed.\n\nLotus-born rebirth:\nIn the Buddhist tradition, the Western Pure Land’s beings emerge from lotus flowers.\nIn the *Dao* tradition, the *Qinghua Changle* realm’s beings are lotus-born.\nIt is also said: *\"Desire arises from the lotus.\"*\nMeaning that in both worldly and transcendent existence,\nthey remain unstained by dust,\nwith wondrous *dharma* perpetually arising,\nfree from defiled thoughts.\nAs at the dawn of heaven and earth,\nnaturally giving rise to humanity.\n\nConfucian scholars often dismiss the two teachings as false.\nYet Yi Yin was born from a lotus—\nwas he not a sage of Confucian virtue?\n\nMoreover, the human heart\n\nThe virtuous *power* of those who uphold the *Sutra* extends not only to humanity.\nIf the *Sutra* traverses rivers, lakes, the Huai, and the seas,\nand washes over their bodies,\nthen all beings in that water—\nfish, tortoises, *qīnghua* (鼋), *tuó* (鼉), and every aquatic creature—\nshall have their past karmic transgressions utterly extinguished,\nand shall exhaust their present lifetime’s retribution.\nAfter death, they attain the wondrous fruit of rebirth,\nno longer receiving bodies of birth—\nwhether from egg, womb, moisture, or transformation—\nin all forms.\n\nThose who uphold the *Sutra*,\nwhen speaking all words and sounds,\neven the most perverse *demons* and *external paths*,\nhearers mistake them not for mundane speech or breath,\nbut as the pure and sacred tones of *dharma*.\n\nShould they encounter divine shrines,\nthey can recite this *Sutra* to the deities,\nand when the spirits and gods hear this *Sutra*,\nthey break free from the *karmic realm of ghosts*,\nascend to the *Way of the Immortal*,\nand revere such upholders\nas they would the sovereign Emperor himself.\n\n**The *Sutra* traverses:**\nThe *Sutra* is the passage through;\n*traverse* means to cross.\nSome say: \"To cross water bare-bodied is called *traverse*—*\nlike the Master Lü’s chanting flight over Dongting Lake,\nor Bodhidharma’s lotus-stalk crossing of the river.\nIn essence, all crossing of water—\nwhether bare-bodied, by boat, or otherwise—\nis called *Sutra traverse*.\nRivers, lakes, and seas are all general names for flowing water.\nThe Huai is the Huai River.\n*To wash and bathe their bodies* means to cleanse with water.\n*All beings within water* refers to every living thing in it—\nscaled like fish, shelled like tortoises, *qīnghua* (鼋), *tuó* (鼉), and all aquatic life.\nTheir karmic transgressions are all extinguished,\nand they exhaust their retribution in this very lifetime.\nAfter death, they no longer cycle through animal rebirths—\nwhether feathered, furred, scaled, shelled, or insect-like—\nnor receive bodies from egg, womb, moisture, or transformation.\nThough humans are born from the womb,\nthe term *womb* here does not refer to humans alone,\nbut to all latent forms.\n\nFor dragons are the sovereign among aquatic beings,\nyet they still speak of karmic retribution;\nhow much more so for the lower aquatic creatures!\n\nTrue upholders of the *Sutra* emit golden radiance from their bodies and mouths,\nso wherever their voice reaches,\nall perverse *demons* and *external paths* who hear it\nbelieve it to be the pure and sacred tones of *dharma*.\n\nTo recite the *Sutra* for the deities\nis to liberate them from their ghostly *karmic realms*.\nThough deities are subtle and radiant,\ndisplaying their might and manifesting retribution,\nthey still possess *karmic inclinations*.\nHearing this true *Sutra*,\nthey sever their *cognitive roots*,\nuproot their *karmic tendencies*,\nand dissolve all past habits.\n\nTo ascend to the *Way of the Immortal*\nis to attain the highest path of true transcendence.\nThe distinction between gods and immortals lies in their ranks.\nEven great gods, though possessing virtue,\nstill retain visible deeds and traces,\nlike eminent sages who have not yet dissolved their forms,\nor those who have entered sainthood but remain unequal.\n\nImmortals, however,

*Sutra*’s upholders,\nwhich touch the aquatic beings,\nare no less than the transformative *power* of a sage-emperor.\nDragons, enlightened by the law,\nequally touched by the *Sutra*’s waters—\nwho could fail to transcend?\n\nThis is how the *wild fox* attained the law\nand regained its human form.\n\nIf one recites the *Sutra* to deliver gods and ghosts\nfrom their *karmic realms*—\nlike the Master Sa’s deliverance of King Lingguan,\nor the Venerable Puxian’s instruction of Guan the Great Sage—\nthey will revere the divine might,\nforgetting all past afflictions.\nThus, even to this day,\nthe reverence for these two sages does not wane.\n\n**Continuation of the Virtuous *Power* of the *Sutra* (Thirty-Second Chapter):**\n\nIf a person in this world\ndoes not honor their

*Sutra*, and the Master.\nThe *Way* is the root of the Three Teachings,\nthe progenitor of all existence;\nthe *Sutra* is the ferry and sustenance for crossing the world.\n\nThe Master is the eye of humankind and the heavens—\nto disrespect thus incurs one offense.\n\nSlaying, stealing, licentious lust, and false speech—\ngreat transgressions bring great guilt,\nand even a fleeting thought carries sin.\nCountless offenses—\nnot all can be enumerated in words.\n\n**Right Faith** is the utmost sincerity,\nuntainted by ulterior motives.\n\nReciting **one, seven, twenty-three, forty-seven, or a thousand hundred times**—\nor as it is said, *\"completing the Dao’s celestial circuit of transformation\"*—\nthis too is valid.\n\nThey do not fall into the evil realms,\nfor they bear good roots and harbor no wicked thoughts—\nthus they do not descend into evil.\n\nThey cycle through human and heavenly realms,\nor enjoy the blessings of mortal or celestial life.\nSome say: *\"Human blessings are the blessings of both human and heaven.\"*\n\nThey drift in the world’s domains,\nsubject to the impermanence of birth and death,\nlike floating reeds on water,\nentangled in karmic bonds they cannot escape,\nas though submerged in deep waters.\n\n**Worldly domains**—the boundaries of the mortal realm.\n\n**A fleeting shadow’s touch**—\nthe form and shadow of the *Sutra*-holder\nbriefly illuminate the sinful one’s body,\nas though ensnared by the Emperor’s radiant light.\n*\"Receive\"* or *\"authored\"*—\nit is the Emperor’s light that bestows,\nnot the Emperor Himself.\nWhen the light descends upon a person,\nthey stand in solemn reverence, unburdened by thought—\nthus it is said to *\"ensnare and receive.\"*\nI receive the lawful benefits of that light.\n\n**Shared speech or heard voice**—\nthe sinful one may converse with the *Sutra*-holder\nor hear their voice.\n*\"Dao-speech\"*—the profound utterances of the Great Dao.\nOr as some say: *\"The speech of the Dao Ancestor\"*—\ntoo restrictive a claim.\n\n**Comfort and instruction**—\n*\"Comfort\"* is the soothing of kind words;\n*\"instruction\"* is teaching and command.\n\n**Karmic obstacles erased**—\nall past and present sins are released,\nall past and present impediments removed.\n\nThe *Sutra’s* divine power\nbenefits both the living and the departed,\nits blessings extend to all—\nonly those of **right faith** attain such merit.\nThus, **utter sincerity** must be the foundation.\n\n**Benefiting the departed**—\nif one’s blessings extend to others,\nhow then can the merit of those who uphold this *Sutra*\nbe measured?\nLet the observer take heed.\n\n**Continuation of the Merits Chapter (Thirty-Three)**\nIf one who upholds this *Sutra* crafts a long banner,\ninscribing the Emperor’s sacred name upon it,\nand hangs it upon a tall pole—\nwhether in the temple hall or within the household—\nwherever the winds direct that banner,\nall beings in that direction\nshall partake in supreme blessings,\nand all evil deeds shall be utterly eradicated.\n\nIf one who upholds this *Sutra* inscribes the Emperor’s sacred name\nupon all resonant objects—\nwhether bells, chimes, gongs, drums,\nor any Daoist ritual implements—\nwhether struck in ceremony, played in practice,\nor set in motion by the wind,\nwhen their sound emanates—\nnear or far—\nall beings who hear it\nshall have their karmic obstacles purified.\n\nThis further expounds the merits of upholding the *Sutra*.\n\n**Long banner inscribed with the Emperor’s name, tall pole**—\nas previously explained.\n\n**Temple hall**—the halls before the temple’s main sanctuary.\n**Temple**—a place of solemn contemplation,\nwhere the numinous resides without ulterior intent,\nthus called *\"Temple\"* (*guàn*).\n\n**Household courtyard**—before one’s home.\n\n**The direction indicated**—\nthe aspect toward which the wind-blown banner points.\n\n**Supreme blessings**—as previously defined.\n\n**Bells, chimes, gongs, drums, and *tá*—**\nall are ritual instruments of metal.\n\n**All Daoist implements and ritual objects**—\nincluding those of gold, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, clay, leather, and wood,\nand all resonant objects,\nor any implements used in Daoist rites.\n\n**Ritual grounds**—\nwhen the sacred name is struck upon ritual instruments,\nit is permissible.\n\n**How can playful striking also bear merit?**\nThis *\"play\"* is not reckless revelry or frivolous jest—\nit may be the practice of ritual music,\nor the unintentional striking by the young or the ignorant,\nor the casual ringing of resonant objects in leisure.\n**Inscribed sacred name**—\nnot the Emperor’s personal name,\nbut the **Eternal Name**, unchanging across *kalpas*,\nthe abiding Great Name—\nthus called *\"sacred name.\"*\n\n**Wind-struck sound**—\nwhen the wind causes resonant objects to chime.\n\n**Near and far, all beings who hear the sound**—\ntheir karmic obstacles are utterly purified.\nWithout distinction of distance,\nall who hear the sacred name’s resonance\nshall have their sins dissolved and be cleansed.\n\n**Investigation:**\nAncient music was crafted to harmonize the divine and human,\nto unite heaven and earth.\nHow much more so when the sacred name—\nthe honored title of the Primordial—\nis heard, inspiring awe?\nWhen the lawful sound resounds,\nits divine efficacy is boundless.\n\n**Emperor Shun’s music** made even beasts dance in rhythm—\nhow much more so for humans?\nHearing martial instruments inspires awe,\nhearing playful toys brings delight,\nhearing the *qin* brings harmony—\nhow much more so the sacred sound?\n\nAll resonant playthings are irrelevant.\nRitual instruments and musical tools\nare used to honor the numinous and unify the will of the assembly.\nMoreover, since the sacred name is inscribed,\nthose who hear it in reverence shall have their sins erased.\n\nFor **karmic obstacles** are the retribution for evil deeds.\nWhen the lawful sound is heard,\ngoodwill arises spontaneously—\nthus all karmic obstacles are annihilated,\nand purity is attained.\n\nEven now, a single thunderclap\nfills listeners with reverence and fear—\nthis suffices as proof.\n\n**Clarifying Doubts:**\nIn this age, many hang banners\nand inscribe the sacred name upon ritual instruments and resonant objects,\nyet those who see or hear them\ndo not have their karmic obstacles removed—\nwhy is this?\n\nThose who inscribe lack **true, sincere faith** in upholding the *Sutra*,\nand those who hear or see it treat it as mere custom,\ntheir stubborn hearts unrepentant,\neven to the point of contempt, frivolity, or blasphemy—\nwithout genuine devotion,\nhow can sins be absolved?\n\nAlas! The *Sutra’s* sacred name—\nits merits are immeasurable.\nThe ancient sages first upheld the *Sutra* to transcend themselves—\nwithout movement, they inspire reverence;\nwithout speech, they command faith.\nThen, with the sacred name, they bless others—\nthus their own blessings endure eternally.\n\n**Continuation of the Merits Chapter (Thirty-Four)**\nIf one who upholds this *Sutra* attains enlightenment on birth and death,\nretreats into deep mountains and forests to cultivate the True Way,\nand at times ascends to overlook the peaks,\nwherever their gaze extends—\nacross mountains, forests, streams, and valleys,\nall living beings—\nvisible and invisible,\nconceived in womb, egg, moisture, or transformation,\ncreeping, flying, swimming, or dormant—\nall classes of existence,\ntheir sins and karmic bonds shall be eradicated,\ntheir bodies and minds purified,\nand upon death, they shall be reborn in heaven.\n\nHow much more so for those who uphold this *Sutra*?\nKnow that such a person is already the embodiment of the Dao藏’s virtue/power.\n\nHere, it further expounds upon the efficacy of upholding the *Sutra*—\n**Enlightenment on birth and death.**\nBirth and death are profound matters, their essence most difficult to fathom.\nDependent upon the vital essence and blood of parents,\nreceiving the *li* and *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nlife—this is how one comes to be, yet its origin is unfathomable.\nWhen the essence is exhausted and the *qi* dissipates,\nwhen the spirit departs and the form withers—\ndeath—this is how one ceases to be, yet its end is unfathomable.\nNot knowing life, not knowing death,\nthough one may grasp the changes of affairs,\nobserve the principles of things,\nand speak with clarity while acting without delusion—\nthis is not yet enlightenment.\n\nIf one who upholds the *Sutra* abandons the sacred and forsakes wisdom,\neliminates the two obstructions,\nsevers all delusions,\nfuses innate nature,\nattains great awakening,\nrealizes the Three Primordials,\nascends to the highest state,\nand penetrates the root of birth and death—\nthis is what the Buddhist school calls *perfect enlightenment*.\n\n**Retreating into deep mountains and forests.**\nThe ancients said: *\"The small hidden one resides in the mountains.\"*\nSince one has attained enlightenment,\nwhether high mountain or level plain—\nall are Dao-fields.\nWhy must cultivation necessarily be in mountains and forests?\nThe great hidden one resides in the marketplace—\nthis is also true in principle.\nFamous peaks and scenic wonders,\nwhere the land’s *ling* is potent and sages abound—\ntrue cultivators,\nthough they have no inclination for mountains and forests,\nfind that secluded peaks and lush groves\nare naturally formed as immortal realms.\nThus, the recluse enters them.\n\n**Cultivating the True Way and learning the Dao.**\nHuman nature’s original purity is utterly true, without falsity.\nThe Way of nature is spontaneous, needing no study or inquiry.\nYet as desires grow daily,\none is seduced by external transformations,\nand the true gradually becomes false,\nthe Way of nature obscured.\nThose who attain enlightenment,\nin mountain or forest glades,\nsilently refine their cultivation,\nrestoring the Heavenly True,\npartaking in the Great Dao,\nand transcending birth and death.\n*The Dao De Jing* says: *\"Cease learning, and you will have no worries.\"*\nYet here it says *\"learning the Dao\"*—why?\nThere, *\"cease learning\"* refers to abandoning the names, forms, and thoughts of learning.\nHere, *\"learning the Dao\"* means learning the boundless, effortless Way.\nThe Buddhist school holds enlightenment as supreme.\nYet here, enlightenment is but the beginning—\nonly then does one enter the mountains to cultivate the True Way and learn the Dao.\nThus, the ranks of these two paths are clear.\n\nAt times, those who learn the Dao ascend heights, overlook waters,\ntravel through wondrous landscapes,\nand from mountain peaks survey all four directions.\nWherever their gaze extends—\nwhether mountains, forests, streams, or valleys—\n*valleys*, the hollows and deep chasms of mountains—\nall living beings, both manifest and latent,\nthose already born and those yet unborn,\nincluding those born unseen—\nwhether womb-born, egg-born,\nor generated from moisture and filth,\nor spontaneously arising from nothingness,\nall creeping, flying, swimming, or dormant—\nthe myriad classes of created life,\ntheir past and present sins and karmic bonds,\nall are eradicated.\nTheir bodies and minds are purified,\nfree from all entanglements,\nand at death, they are reborn in Heaven.\n\nThe merits of a True Cultivator’s gaze extending to all things are thus—\nhow much more so for those who uphold this *Sutra*?\nKnow that such a one’s virtue/power is boundless,\nthe very essence of the Dao’s profound藏,\nincalculable,\na body of supreme virtue/power.\n\nThe cultivator’s heart is vast in compassion and love,\nnever without benevolence.\nThough unseen by sight or hearing,\ntheir gaze encompasses all things,\nand in silent reverence, they extend their spirit to rescue all sentient beings,\ndelivering them from the world.\nThus, they save all beings.\n\nAs the Confucian classics say:\n*\"Achieving harmony, all things are nurtured.\"*\n*\"Establishing the Spirit Platform, they observe the encroaching mists,\ndiscerning calamities and omens,\nand through subtle means, complete and assist all things.\"*\nWhat Heaven and Earth cannot reach,\nthey enable humanity and spirits to receive their natural fate,\nreturning to the source of transformation—\nwhat sins or karmic bonds could remain?\n\nThose who praise Confucius say:\n*\"In a single lifetime, one cannot exhaust his learning;\nacross generations, one cannot fully grasp his depth.\"*\nThe ineffable is called divine.\nNow, praising those who cultivate the True Way and learn the Dao,\nwe say: *\"the embodiment of the Dao藏’s virtue/power.\"*\nThis speaks to its boundless embrace,\nits unfathomable depth—\npraise that cannot be exhausted.\nThose who study the *Sutra* will understand this meaning.\n\n**Continuation of the Merits Chapter (Thirty-Five)**\nAt that time, the Celestial Sovereign addressed the Jade Emptiness Emperor:\n*\"Now I have spoken briefly, yet the mysteries remain unfathomed.\nIf I were to expound fully,\nthose with errant views, doubts, and disbelief\nwould never exhaust the *Sutra*’s merits across kalpas.\"*\n\nAt that time—\n*(as previously explained)*\nThe Celestial Sovereign refers to the Primordial Sovereign of the Beginning.\n*\"To speak\"* means to address the Jade Emptiness Emperor of the Supreme Brightness.\n*(Alternatively, the Jade Purity Emperor of the Void.)*\n*\"Now I\"* refers to the Primordial Sovereign speaking at this moment.\n*\"Briefly\"* means to outline the essentials.\n*\"Unfathomed\"* means the Dao’s supreme mysteries and highest merits remain unexhausted.\n\nIf one were to expound fully upon this *Sutra*,\nits merits—merits of reciting and upholding the *Sutra*,\nbenefiting sentient beings and all things,\nbenefiting existence and non-existence,\nbenefiting the formed and the formless,\nbenefiting self and others,\nbenefiting heaven and earth—\nare already vast indeed.\n\nYet even so, if one were to expound fully,\nthose with errant views and disbelief\nwould still remain unconvinced.\n\nWhat is spoken of here encompasses:\nall beings in one world, past and present,\nthe existence and destruction of heaven and earth,\nas well as the three thousand great thousand worlds,\nfrom kalpa to kalpa, countless kalpas,\none future age, all future ages,\nfrom the beginning without beginning,\nto the end without end,\nwhether knowing or unaware,\nwhether perceiving or not perceiving,\nwhether conceptualizable or inconceivable,\nwhether finite or infinite—\nall merits, both within this *Sutra* and for those who uphold it,\nif widely proclaimed and expounded in their profundity,\nwould still leave the common folk—\nthe vulgar and the ordinary—\nwith errant views, doubts, and disbelief.\n\n*\"Vulgar\"* refers to the common people of the world;\n*\"flow\"* refers to those of ordinary inclinations.\n\nLike water flowing, it cannot extract the finest grains.\n*\"Evil views\"* are partial and crooked, not upright and vast.\n*\"Doubt\"* arises when wisdom does not prevail—ambiguous, undecided.\n*\"Delusion\"* stirs from private thoughts, tangled and confused, unable to discern right from wrong, a chaotic jumble of misguided perception—thus they disbelieve this *Sutra* holds boundless benefits.\n\nThe *Sutra*’s virtues exhaust even kalpas in speech,\ncountless kalpas beyond reckoning—still, they cannot be fully spoken.\nSome say: \"Exhausting the kalpas in recounting leaves speech still incomplete.\"\nFundamentally, the Primordial Origin endures eternally,\nkalpas are endless, the *Sutra*’s virtues unfathomable,\nthe Great Dao immeasurable—\nyet speech can never exhaust it.\n\nThe Great Dao is beyond words,\nthe Marvelous Law beyond form,\nthe True Scripture beyond letters—\nwhat can be applied and received,\nseen and heard,\nspoken and attained,\nare all but second meanings.\n\nThus, the Most High Sage manifested across countless kalpas,\npreached to twelve thousand heavens,\ntraveled distant realms,\ncomposed countless *Sutras*,\none manifestation lasting seventeen hundred years,\nexpounding the *Sutra* over ninety thousand times—\nyet still declared, *\"I do not know its name,\"*\nand by force named it *Dao*.\n\nConfucius, inheriting the past and opening the future,\nenlightening the ages to come, said, *\"I know nothing.\"*\nThe Śākyamuni Buddha spoke for forty-nine years,\nexpounding the *Sutra* in over three hundred assemblies,\ncomposing the Three Baskets of *Sūtras*, *Vinaya*, and *Abhidharma*—\nyet still said, *\"I now speak briefly, unable to exhaust it.\"*\n\nYán Zǐ stood alone, his heart in quietude, said, *\"Though I wish to follow, I cannot find the way.\"*\n\nThis *Sutra* is the root of all teachings—\nits virtues, if spoken, cannot be exhausted,\nthe highest of virtues.\nSpoken of, it cannot be fully grasped.\nSpoken, people still cannot truly understand.\n\nThus, the Confucian *wuwei* governance,\nthe Daoist true and profound virtues,\nthe Buddhist offering of life and body—\nthe righteousness of the Western import—\nare all beyond what can be transmitted in words.\n\nAh! The wonder of the Wheel-turning Sage—\nheart and hand in perfect accord.\n\nZhuangzi, the master of the Three Teachings,\nthus beyond the six directions—\npreserved without discussion,\nsank without debate—\nnot that he could not speak,\nbut words easily stir confusion—\nbetter to remain silent.\n\nEven the Master rarely spoke of fate,\nfor the Nature and Dao are beyond hearing.\n\nThe Buddha spoke of countless worldly scenes,\ndividing them into matters and principles—\nsetting aside their boundless, unverifiable vastness,\neven if grounded, what cannot be spoken remains much.\nThose who follow his teachings assume the Buddha spoke what no one else could—\nfoolishly deeming it lofty—\nyet he was born in a distant land,\namong strange peoples and customs,\na rugged, remote place,\nsurrounded by many,\nand the Buddha accommodated their views.\nChina did not know.\n\nFoolishly claiming the Buddha’s vision was vast—\nobserve China alone: within a hundred *li*, customs differ.\nYan, Yue, Tai, and Qi—\nmountains and rivers shift the winds—\nthose who do not traverse them cannot know.\nHow much more so the distant Western Regions?\nEven with historical records, they are but hearsay and miscellany—\nhow can they be trusted without error?\n\nMen love the strange and unusual,\nwithout investigating truth—\nif the Buddha truly knew all,\nwhy did his scriptures not enter China in Tang texts,\ntranslated three times before becoming coherent?\nSince they did not know Tang speech,\nwhat he spoke must have been of neighboring lands—\nor perhaps, like Zhuangzi’s parables, some were allegorical.\n\nPeople do not examine closely,\nerroneously judging superiority—\nhow their love of the strange exceeds!\n\nAlas, not speaking of all realms\nprevents further confusion—\nbriefly speaking of virtues and transformations\nto awaken the ignorant,\nrevealing true intent,\nmanifesting the correct Law—\nthis is why the Dao brings real benefit.\n\nScholars should diligently investigate further.\n\n*(End of the \"Virtues\" Chapter, continuing the thirty-sixth section.)*\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emptiness Celestial Sovereign, upon hearing this, felt boundless joy, unable to contain his exultation. Gazing upon the benevolent countenance, he bowed in reverence and exclaimed in praise, composing this hymn:\n\n*\"Above the Nine Heavens lies the Great Luo,*\n*Jade Capital of golden gates, its cloud-layers towering.*\n*Within dwells the Heavenly Emperor,*\n*Renowned for mercy and harmony,*\n*His Dao unmatched, subduing all demons.*\n\n*His celestial treasures and sacred talismans,*\n*Jade laws and golden decrees,*\n*Myriad gods and immortals in attendance,*\n*With banners and flags in countless array.*\n*Those who hear his name see sins erased,*\n*Forever freed from the River of Love.\"*\n\nThus is he called the Jade Sovereign—\n*The True Elder of the Azure Vault,*\n*Perfect and pure in wondrous roundness,*\n*Endowed with wisdom and eloquence,*\n*Supreme in Dao and majesty,*\n*Teacher of the Three Realms,*\n*Primordial Ancestor of the Chaos,*\n*Unsurpassed Master of all,*\n*Compassionate Father to the Fourfold Birth,*\n*The Highest Saint of the Celestial Heights,*\n*Great in Mercy and Benevolence.*\n\nTen names complete his glory,\nA thousand virtues manifest in his essence,\nBoundless in his salvation of beings,\nLiberating all from suffering’s cycle.\n\nWhen the Jade Emptiness Celestial Sovereign had finished reciting this hymn and the ten names,\nAll the celestial saints spoke as one in astonishment,\n*\"Never before heard!\"*—\nFor this sacred law and its exalted titles\nAre rare even across eons.\n\nAt the moment the Heavenly Lord concluded this chapter on the divine incantations and virtues,\nThe Jade Emptiness Celestial Sovereign, upon hearing these words,\nFelt overwhelming joy and delight,\nUnable to restrain his rapture.\nGazing upon the Jade Emperor’s benevolent visage,\nHe bowed in reverence and composed this hymn of praise:\n\n*\"Above the Nine Heavens lies the Great Luo,*\n*The Jade Capital’s golden gates,*\n*Its cloud-layers rising in majestic tiers—*\n*Lofty peaks beyond measure.*\n\n*The Great Luo’s golden

Four: The Chapter on Protection**\n**The Protection Chapter**\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Sovereign of the Boundless Sky, upon hearing the scripture’s teachings, rose from his seat and knelt long before the Emperor, humbly declaring:\n*\"I pray that Your Sacred Benevolence universally benefit all assemblies, all celestial beings, and all who uphold and proclaim this scripture for their welfare.\"*\n\nThen, the Jade Sovereign Emperor, moved by compassionate intent, opened the gate of benefit and proclaimed the *Yùkuì* [玉匮] ordinances, transmitting the *Língbǎo* [灵宝] sacred law, and addressed the Celestial Sovereign of the Boundless Sky:\n*\"Now, listen with utmost attention—I shall expound upon the virtues of receiving and upholding this scripture: its power to rescue the perilous, alleviate suffering, benefit the living and the dead, and perform divine and wondrous deeds.\"*\n\nThe assembled Celestial Worthies bowed in reverence and spoke in unison:\n*\"Today, we are fortunate to hear the *Zhànrán Chángzhù* [湛然常住]—the ever-abiding law.

Rising from his own seat, he knelt long before the Jade Emperor and respectfully declared:\n*\"I pray that Your Most Exalted Benevolence universally extend mercy to all assemblies—whether the celestial saints who hear this scripture, or the worldly multitude, though the heavens contain no worldly folk, for this scripture spans the Three Realms across boundless kalpas. It benefits all celestial beings and mortals, and all who uphold and proclaim its teachings, granting them boundless welfare.\"*\n\nAt that moment, the Jade Sovereign Emperor, moved by compassionate intent, awakened the boundless wisdom of deliverance, opened the gate of eternal benefit, and proclaimed the *Yùkuì* [玉匮] sacred ordinances—this scripture being the *Yùbì Lánghán* [玉笈琅函], treasured in the heavens, hence the phrase *\"proclaim the Yùkuì ordinances.\"* He then transmitted the *Xuánlíng Miǎobǎo Dàfǎ* [玄灵妙宝大法], the profound and sacred law, and said to the Celestial Sovereign of the Boundless Sky:\n*\"Now, listen with utmost discernment—I shall speak to you of the virtues of receiving and upholding this scripture: its power to rectify all perilous straits, rescue all from suffering, and benefit all living and departed through divine and wondrous means.\"*\n\nThe assembled Celestial Worthies bowed in reverence and spoke in unison:\n*\"Today, we are fortunate to hear the *Zhànrán Chángzhù* [湛然常住] law—the ever-abiding, untainted, unspoiled, unchanging, neither ascending nor descending essence of human nature. Though entangled by external afflictions, we ourselves bring ruin, drifting through the wheel of existence in blind ignorance, unable to abide in this ever-present truth. Even spirits with attachments and gods with sentience, though their karmic retributions end and they return to the cycle, still cannot abide in this ever-present truth. Now, hearing the scripture’s virtues and benefits, our innate nature is purified, the roots and dust of defilement are exhausted, karmic deeds and perceptions are extirpated, sins and obstructions are removed, and perfection is firmly established. This is the hearing of the ever-abiding law—a rare encounter in the ages, how could we not be fortunate? Its power extends blessings to all celestial realms and beings, permeating the Three Realms, as previously explained.\"*\n\nThe Three Abysses—Heaven’s Abyss, Earth’s Abyss, Water’s Abyss—\nThe Five Sufferings: the suffering of form bound by color, the suffering of spirit bound by desire, the suffering of body bound by greed, the suffering of soul bound by physical burdens, the suffering of essence bound by the realm of adornment.\nAll are thus extinguished.\nOnly by the Most Venerable’s boundless compassion and pity for my subjects—\n*Pity* being compassionate mercy and tender concern—\ndoes this wondrous meaning unfold.\n\nFor this scripture is the supreme and wondrous Dao, hence its such virtues.\nThough the Celestial Sovereign of the Azure Sky does not seek its profound intent, yet he requests its blessings—not to flatter like one offering drink to a man.\nEven a single word or stroke of this scripture is an immeasurable treasure.\nKnowing its efficacy and holding it with true sincerity, one will not fail the compassion of its proclamation.\n\n**Chapter One: The Chapter of Protection**\n\nThe Jade Emperor declared:\n*\"If any being reveres and nurtures their parents, honors the Three Treasures with respect, exhausts loyalty to their ruler, commits no killing nor theft, indulges in no lust nor jealousy, harbors no wrath nor resentment, no arrogance nor deceit, upholds precepts and observes pure fasting, merges their heart with the Great Dao, nurtures a reverent mind toward life, and recites this scripture, I shall command the law to permeate all realms, spreading across the ten directions of the boundless world. I shall order the Eastern East-Hua Emperor with his green cavalry, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Southeastern Fu-Sang Grand Emperor with his divine soldiers and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Southern Zhu-Ling Grand Emperor with his red cavalry, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Southwestern Tai-Hua Elder with his divine soldiers and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Western Hao-Ling Sovereign Elder with his white cavalry, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Northwestern Celestial Sovereign with his divine soldiers and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Northern Zi-Wei Emperor with his black cavalry, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Northeastern Chong-Xu Heavenly Lord with his divine soldiers and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Supreme Heavenly Emperor of the Upper Realm, the Kunlun Elder with his yellow cavalry, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Lower Realm Lai-He Heavenly Lord, the mountain-grove deities, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture.\"*\n\nThe Jade Emperor declared:\n*\"Upholding the scripture is not merely reciting it aloud. If any being in the world reveres and nurtures their parents, honors the Daoist scriptures and the Three Treasures with respect, exhausts their strength and heart in loyalty to their ruler, refrains from killing, stealing, lust, jealousy, wrath, resentment, arrogance, or deceit, receives and upholds the pure and mysterious precepts of the Dao, observes true fasting with sincerity, neither neglectful nor hasty, tranquil and unhurried, surrendering to nature, nurturing stillness, aligning with Heaven and congealing the True—merging their heart with the Great Dao, revering it as the Azure Sky—if they hold this scripture with solemn devotion, I, the Jade Emperor, shall command the law to permeate all worlds, spreading across the ten directions of the boundless realm. I shall order the Eastern East-Hua Emperor with his green cavalry, the Southern Zhu-Ling Grand Emperor with his red cavalry, the Western Hao-Ling Sovereign Elder with his white cavalry, the Northern Zi-Wei Emperor with his black cavalry, the Southeastern Fu-Sang Grand Emperor, the Southwestern Tai-Hua Elder, the Northwestern Celestial Sovereign—these are the four cardinal directions—the Northeastern Chong-Xu Heavenly Lord, the Supreme Heavenly Emperor of the Upper Realm—this is not the Gou-Chen Celestial Sovereign, but the deity who governs Heaven. The Buddha called this the realm of the *Devadatta* (帝释天主). The Kunlun Elder with his yellow cavalry, the Lower Realm Lai-He Heavenly Lord, the mountain-grove deities, and their divine soldiers and countless hosts shall all descend to shield and protect those who uphold this scripture.\"*\n\n*Shield and protect* means to cherish and uphold.\nThose who uphold the scripture, revering the Emperor’s words of the Dao, harmonizing with virtue, aligning with Heaven and the Dao in truth—these are the bodies of the Great Dao.\nWhere the Dao resides, both gods and mortals hold it in reverence, hence the Emperor commands the ten-directional holy hosts to shield and protect.\n\nYet this is only for those who are loyal, filial, respectful, and abstain from lust, killing, theft, and falsehood.\nUpholding the scripture must be rooted in virtuous conduct, merging the heart with the Dao—then the Dao itself will return to them.\n\nSome say, *\"The Dao withdraws from the world, avoiding rulers and kin, thus not practicing filial piety or loyalty.\"*\nThey do not know the Dao’s profound precepts are most strict—guarding, preserving, and refining, never daring to violate precepts or bring shame to their bodies or kin.\nWith utmost sincerity and firmness, they first repay the Four Graces—how could they ever forget their rulers and kin, or be unfilial or disloyal?\nThus, the True Lord composed *The Scripture of Pure Clarity on Filial Piety and Loyalty*, to reveal the Dao’s true filial piety and loyalty.\n\n**Chapter Two: The Chapter of Protection**\n\nI command all the Golden Immortals of the ten directions, the Four Assemblies and Eight Divisions, and their attendants, to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture.\nI command the Heavenly True Saints of the ten directions, the Flying Heavenly Kings, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Two Luminaries and Nine Stars, the Northern Dipper and Southern Dipper, the Eastern Dipper and Western Dipper, the Central Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Celestial Hosts, the Vajra Warriors, and the Divine Kings—each with their hosts—to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Chapter of Protection**\n\nI command the ten-directional celestial hosts, the Four Assemblies and Eight Divisions, and their attendants, to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture.\n\nI command the ten-directional worlds of all Golden Immortals. The Golden Immortals are the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The Four Assemblies are not the Four Assemblies of the secular world, but the Four Assemblies of the yin and yang deities and their celestial troops. The Eight Divisions are explained in the second volume. The attendants are the kinsmen and affiliated beings of the Four Assemblies and Eight Divisions.\n\nThe Heavenly True Saints of the ten directions are the True Saints of all the celestial beings in the ten directions. The Flying Heavenly Kings are explained previously. The Three Officials are Heaven, Earth, and Water. The Four Saints are Tianpang, Tianyou, Yisheng, and Yousheng. The Two Luminaries are the Sun and Moon. The Nine Stars are: Jin (金), Mu (木), Shui (水), Huo (火), Tu (土), Yue Mo (月孛), Zi Zhi (紫炁), Luo Hou (罗喉), and Ji Du (计都).\n\nNorth, South, East, West, and Central are the Five Dippers. The Twenty-Eight Constellations are: Jiao (角), Keng (亢), Shi (氏), Fang (房), Xin (心), Wei (尾), Ji (箕), Dou (斗), Niu (牛), Nü (女), Xu (虚), Wei (危), Shi (室), Bi (壁), Kui (奎), Lou (娄), Wei (胃), Mao (昴), Bi (毕), Zhi (觜), Shen (参), Jing (井), Gui (鬼), Liu (柳), Xing (星), Zhang (张), Yi (翼), Zhen (轸)—all the stars of the celestial circuit.\n\nThe Vajra Warriors and Divine Kings are all the generals and troops. Each with their subordinates and attendant hosts.\n\nThe *Scripture* is the Emperor’s decree, proclaimed by the court command. The Three Ministers, Four Officials, the Two Capitals’ Nine Ministers, all officials and attendants, nobles of different surnames, and the myriad common folk—none dare fail to revere and uphold it.\n\nThe Jade Scripture is guarded and sustained by myriad deities, for the Emperor’s command honors the virtuous and aids those of power. Within the human body are the Three Primordials, Four Symbols, Two Qi, Nine Orifices, Five Phases, and the degrees of the Twenty-Eight Constellations—encompassing the celestial circuits. Water, Fire, True Will, Great Wisdom, Cultivation, Vigorous Practice, Marvelous Dharma, and Meritorious Deeds align with the deities, so that within a single body—its hair and skin, flesh and blood, sinews and bones, spirit and qi, essence and meridians—all support the True Nature’s authentic qi, preserving the vital treasure.\n\nThis True Nature’s authentic qi is the Emperor’s True Scripture: thirty-six thousand divine qi and eighty-four thousand fine-pored true lights, manifesting the Ten Directions’ Immortals, Vajra Warriors, and Stellar Divine Kings and their hosts. The *Sutra of Disaster Dissipation* states: *\"There are the Heavenly True Saints and Vajra Warriors, each numbering hundreds of billions, guarding this Scripture\"*—this is its meaning.\n\nThe Scripture is not confined to words and letters; its true intent lies within our heart. The deities are not bound to the Ten Directions’ worlds; they reside within our single body.\n\n「Cultivate the mind and refine the body—this is not achieved through mere chanting and reading, but through sincere, silent practice, with utmost sincerity and selflessness. When spirit and *qi* are complete, the Sage can be emulated, Heaven can be aspired to, the Dao/Way can be entered, and all actions will bring auspicious results; the deities will surely protect you.\n\nWhen the three medicines are depleted and the True Nature is lost, one’s own spirit weakens, *qi* falters, and essence fails to circulate fully—this defies Heaven’s order. How then could the deities protect you?\n\nAlas, all humans share the same essence, but the virtuous who cultivate it thrive in auspiciousness, while the petty who defy it meet disaster. Thus the Scripture says: *\"Those who cover and protect this Scripture will know the blessings of Heaven through virtue.\"*\n\nThe Emperor’s virtue is boundless, and the benefits of this Scripture are supreme—how greatly do people respect and receive it?\n\nThe *Chapter of Protection* decrees: The Vajra Warriors who command life and death, the Four Heavenly Kings of the gates, the Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Waters, as well as all named mountains, the Four Seas and Nine Rivers, the Twelve River Sources, forests, valleys, streams, and marshes—all their ruling deities and their retinues—shall cover and protect those who receive and uphold this Scripture. In all perilous and treacherous places, they shall grant safety and stability.\n\nThe Emperor’s decree extends to all local deities of the lands, including those of ditches and canals, as well as all great-power ghostly kings, commanding them to cover and protect those who receive and uphold this Scripture.\n\nThe Twelve River Sources are now recorded as thirteen names, for two waters share the same source—thus it is called the Twelve River Sources. The decree commands the Subduing Kings and Heavenly Vajra Warriors. The Four Heavenly Kings of the gates are the Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern gatekeepers. The Five Sacred Mountains are: the Eastern **Tài**, Southern **Héng**, Western **Huá**, Northern **Héng**, and Central **Sōng**. The Four Great Waters refer to the deities of the **Jiāng**, **Hé**, **Huái**, and **Jì** rivers.\n\nAll named mountains in the world are included. The Four Seas are the Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern seas. The Nine Rivers include: **Yángzǐ**, **Qiantáng**, **Hànyáng**, **Huìyáng**, **Hùntóng**, **Jǐn Jiāng**, **Xiāng Jiāng**, **Wūlóng**, and **Yālù**, encompassing all rivers.\n\nThe Twelve River Sources are the origins of the Yellow River, the world’s vital vein: such as **Kūnlún**, **Yǔmén**, **Xīngxiù Hǎi**, **Huǒdūn Nǎo’ér**, and its tailing streams, **Fāxiè** and **Fáxiè**, along with the roots of other rivers that flow into it. Another account states that when discussing the Yellow River’s sources, **Kūnlún** has nine wells and seven springs, not just twelve. The Twelve River Sources pertain to the nine rivers—**Túhài**, **Tàishǐ**, **Mǎxiá**, **Fùfǔ**, **Húsū**, **Jiǎnjié**, **Gōu pán**, **Gēlín**, **Rǔ**, **Hàn**, **Huái**, and **Sì**—as well as the **Rǔ**, **Hàn**, **Huái**, and **Sì** waters, totaling twelve.\n\nThe Yellow River is the supreme deity of all rivers. Rivers like **Jīng**, **Wèi**, **Yí**, **Wèn**, **Shēn**, **Wéi**, **Hùtuó**, **Xīngxié**, and **Ruòshuǐ**, along with all other rivers, are its subordinate deities. The forests and mountains encompass all terrestrial groves and peaks. The streams and marshes are all the world’s flowing waters and wetlands. *川* refers to moving waters; *泽* means stagnant waters. All ruling deities of mountains, forests, streams, and marshes, along with their retinues, are commanded to cover and protect those who uphold this Scripture.\n\nIn all hazardous and difficult places, let them have no worries and find stability—this refers specifically to those who hold the Scripture. Wherever the Emperor’s decree reaches, all local deities and responsive spirits of the lands shall heed it. *沟* (gōu) are dry channels, either in mountains or earth; *渠* (qú) are waterways. *等神* (děngshén) includes all minor deities beyond ditches and canals.\n\nAll great-power ghostly kings are likewise commanded to cover and protect those who uphold this Scripture.\n\nThe essence of this Imperial Scripture aligns with the treasures of all Immortals, the teachings of all Buddhas, the practices of all Heavens, the reverence of all deities, and the recitations of all people. Demons and malevolent spirits submit themselves. Indeed, mountains are steadied by it, and waters flow endlessly—its protection is strict and unyielding.\n\nIf those who uphold the Scripture are its very guardians, how then could they dare to be negligent? A single moment of carelessness brings grave sin and deep consequences.\n\nTruly, Confucius said: *\"The petty do not know Heaven’s decree and do not fear it.\"* They mock the great, scorn the words of the Sage—this is the petty. Even in observing this Scripture, one must still guard against arrogance and exert diligence.\n\nThe *Fifth Chapter of Protection* concludes.»\n\nThe **Scripture** commands all **demons (魔)** and **external heretics (外道)**—whether **Heavenly Demons (天魔)**, **Earthly Demons (地魔)**, **Demon Kings (魔王)**, **Demon Folk (魔民)**, or **Demon Women (魔女)**—to tremble and submit, vanish their forms and flee their traces, soar high beyond the seas, and retreat far to distant realms.\n\nThus, all **mountain spirits, forest deities, ancestral shrines, and temple guardians (山林社稷祠庙之属)**, as well as **every ghost and spirit (一切鬼神)**, shall **self-destruct and vanish (自消灭)**.\n\nThe **Five Directions’ Plague and Epidemic Demons (五方行病瘟疫鬼帅)**, **all malevolent ghosts and spirits (诸恶鬼神)**, including the **Wind King (风王)** and **water monsters (水怪)**, the **sinful retributive dragons (孽音业龙)** and **malevolent deities (妖神)**, **earthly spirits (土精)** and **water sirens (水魅)**, shall all **self-destruct and vanish (尽自消灭)**.\n\nThe **Five Empties (五虚)** and **Six Depletions (六耗)**, **unusual dreams (梦寐乖常)**, **sorcery along wild paths (野道咒咀)**, and **poisonous hexes (蛊毒之类)** shall likewise **self-destruct and vanish (皆自消灭)**.\n\nFor those who **uphold the Scripture with a devout heart (持经人心欲愿者)**, all **whims shall be fulfilled (一切如意)**, and **every desire shall be satisfied (皆得满足)**.\n\n**Astonishing and resounding (慑音聂)!**\n\nThe **Scripture commands (令)**—by **imperial decree (勅命)**, **prohibition (禁令)**, and **extermination (剿除)**—all **demons (诸魔)** and **external heretics (外道)**:\n\n**External heretics (外道)** are those who indulge in **lewd speech (淫辞)**, **perverse doctrines (邪说)**, **deviant practices (僻行)**, **miscellaneous techniques (杂法)**, **side-door sorcery (旁门)**, and **petty occult arts (小术)**, including **private methods (私技)** numbering **three thousand six hundred, ninety-six kinds, or thirty-six thousand (三千六百、九十六种、三万六千等)**.\n\nThe **Scripture commands (令)**—by **imperial decree (勅命)**, **prohibition (禁令)**, and **extermination (剿除)**—that they **all tremble and submit (悉皆慑伏)**.\n\nAll **demons (诸魔)**—**trepidation (慑)** is the **submission of the heart in awe (惊畏心服)**, **subjugation (伏)** is the **retraction and surrender (收敛归伏)**. They **conceal their forms and flee their traces (潜形遁迹)**—**concealment (潜)** means to **hide their likeness (藏其形象)**, daring not to reveal themselves; **flight (遁)** means to **evade their traces (逃其影迹)**, daring not to linger.\n\nThough the forms of these **demons (诸魔)** may outwardly appear **bewitching (妖艳)** and their illusory shapes **strange and beautiful (幻象奇美)**, their true nature is **obstructed (阻)**, unseen by mortals. This **Scripture’s true teachings (真法)** shatter the **ghosts’ resolve (破鬼之胆)** and **shatter the demons’ hearts (碎魔之心)**. No demon can escape its scrutiny—**awe-struck by the profound and potent decrees (玄律丹劲)**, they dare not linger, lest their **ugly essence (丑质)** be exposed.\n\nThe **external heretics (外道)** seek to **obscure the truth (乱真)** with their words. When the **True Dao (正道)** prevails, **deviant doctrines (邪说)** fade; when the **Great Dao (大道)** is honored, **side-paths (傍门)** are abandoned. Once the **imperial decree (帝命)** is proclaimed, they dare not persist.\n\nTo **soar beyond the seas (高飞海外)**—their **demonic deeds (魔行)** leave no trace—**a metaphor for utter disappearance (飞言)**. How could **external heretics (外道)** be said to **fly (飞)**? To **restrain the heart and ease the mind (格心易虑)**, to **turn toward transformation and abandon selfishness (向化忘私)**, to **ascend beyond the seas (高腾海外)**—this is the **common phrase (俗语言)** for **the soul fleeing to the heavens (魂飞天外)** and **the spirit dispersing into the nine heavens (魄散九霄)**. They flee to distant lands, **daring not to remain in their former places (不敢居其故地)**.\n\nThus, all **mountain spirits, forest deities, land gods (社), grain gods (稷), temple spirits (祠), and ancestral shrines (庙)**—those that demand **blood sacrifices and offerings (血食)**—**every ghost and spirit (鬼神)** shall **self-destruct (自消灭)**.\n\n**Mountains and forests (山林)**—as previously explained. **Land gods (社)** are **earth spirits (土神)**; **grain gods (稷)** are **harvest deities (谷神)**. **Temples (祠)** are **overseers (司)** and **sacrificial rites (祀)**—where deities **oversee and are invoked (神之司临)**. **Shrines (庙)** are **places of worship (朝)**, where **ancestral spirits are honored (妾神於庙)** and **sacrifices of blood, grain, and wine (血食享牲醴)** are offered.\n\nAll these **spirits (鬼神)** are **worthy of veneration (宜祀者)**—how then can they **self-destruct (自消灭)**? If **spirits are summoned without proper rites (神邀祭祀)**, they will **act unjustly (为不直)**; if **the people flatter ghosts and spirits (民谄鬼神)**, they will **act corruptly (为不正)**.\n\nThus, the **Master Sa Zhengren** subdued the **King of Spirits (王灵官)** and reformed the **City City God (禁城隍)**; **Ximen Bao**, governor of **Jizhou**, cast the **shaman into the water** to restrain the **River Spirit (河神)**. How much more so when **evil spirits feign divinity to deceive people**, and **people revere falsehoods to mislead the common folk**?\n\nTherefore, **Hu Ying** in his governance of **Guangdong** destroyed **illusionary Buddhas** and slew **demonic serpents**, punishing monks to free the ignorant masses. Now it is said that **all ghosts and spirits shall self-destruct (消灭)**—following the **Scripture’s decree**, they **no longer bestow blessings or calamities**, and their **threat and influence vanish**.\n\nThe **Five Directions’ Plague and Epidemic Spirit Generals (五方行病瘟疫鬼帅)**—these **malevolent ghosts and spirits (诸恶鬼神)** are not the **Plague Spirit Generals (行病鬼帅)**, but rather **the world’s malevolent and powerful ghosts (世之厉鬼强神)**. Alongside them, the **Wind Sovereigns (并行风之王)**, **water monsters (水中之怪)**, **violent and sinful dragons (作孽暴龙)**, **portentous and malevolent spirits (妖异邪神)**, **earthly sprites and wood demons (土精木魅)**—all shall **self-destruct**.\n\nThe **Five Emptinesses and Six Depletions (五虚六耗)**—the **emptiness of spirit, qi, blood, and body (精神气血身五虚)**, the **withering of the six pulses (六脉衰耗)**—lead to **dreams contrary to nature (梦寐乖常)** and **restless soul and spirit (魂魄不宁)**.\n\nIt is also said that the **Five Emptinesses and Six Depletions (五虚六耗)** are like **heaven’s weeping and ruin (天哭破败)**, the **stars of calamity (丧门、太岁、大耗、小耗、飞康、空亡、黄旛、豹尾、九果、赤口、白舌)**—**malevolent omens, killing stars, and malevolent deities (恶厌神杀凶星、作祸神鬼之属)**—all **malevolent affairs (一切辱事)**, **wild Daoist rites (野道)**, **evil spells (邪法)**, **curses and incantations (咒诅妖语)**, whether **curses or oaths (或咒或誓)**, and **poisonous hexes and bewitchments (及蛊毒魇昧之类)**—all shall **self-destruct**.\n\nFor those who **hold this Scripture with sincere desire (持经人心欲愿者)**, all **schemes and aspirations (谋望)** that align with their hearts’ wishes (趁心如意) shall be **fulfilled without obstruction (皆得满足，无有违逆)**.\n\nThe **virtuous and moral (道德之士)**—ghosts and spirits **revere and hold them in awe (鬼神钦重)**—and all **malevolence and evil shall vanish (凶邪尽消)**.\n\nWhen **Xiang Sang died**, **Zi Tong drove away the plague (梓橦驱瘟)**, **Jing Yang subdued the river dragon (旌阳伏蛟)**, **Master Zu’s ancestor subdued demons (祖天师伏魔)**, and **Master Sa restrained ghosts (萨祖禁鬼)**—all had **clear and manifest effects (皆有明效)**.\n\nAh! **Wang Yanzhang** was a **hero of integrity (烈士)**—though he **stole the wish for execution (盗愿刑戮)**, he **did not allow Yanzhang to know of external Dao (外道)**, truly a **man of virtue (诚有德之铃然者)**.\n\nYet, **human beings’ Three Corpses (三尸)**, **Five Burdens (五累)**, **Seven Emotions (七情)**, **Six Desires (六欲)**, and **Nine Consciousnesses (九识)**—**lower evil (下恶)** harms them, and **they deceive themselves (欺不能正己)**. If one **subdues evil and eliminates calamity (伏邪除凶)**, and **advances on the Dao (正进道)**, **severing the Three Corpses (斩三尸)**, **eliminating the Five Burdens (除五累)**, **extinguishing emotions and desires (情欲尽)**, and **removing malevolent consciousness (识恶除)**, then **one’s own wishes shall be fulfilled (己愿尽)**, and **external evils shall vanish while auspiciousness arrives (外邪消，凶散吉临)**.\n\n**Protection and Upholding of the Six Chapters**\nEven if one **cannot follow the prescribed rituals (未能遵依科教)**, **observe fasts (修崇斋醮)**, but only **maintains purity and upholds precepts (清净持戒)**, **devotedly accepts (专一信受)**, **honors and reveres (尊重敬慕)** this Scripture, and **participates in fasting rites (并同修斋)**, those who **uphold pure precepts (护持净戒)** shall have **unobstructed merit (功德坦然无碍)**, **freedom and ease (自在消遥)**, and are called **\"Saints Among Men (人中圣)\"**, with **enduring virtue and wisdom (德慧长新)**, equal to the **True Persons (诸真人)**.\n\nThose who **receive and uphold the Scripture according to its law (如法受持经者)** shall have **merit beyond measure (功德莫量)**.\n\nEven if one **cannot follow the esoteric rituals and precepts (未能遵依玄科教典)**, **observe grand fasts (修崇大斋醮)**, but only **remains pure and unstained (清净无染)**, **upholds precepts with singular devotion (持戒专一)**, and **adheres to the Daoist precept codes (持守道门戒律)**—whether the **Five Precepts, Eight Precepts, Twelve Provisional Precepts, Eighteen Precepts, Twenty-Four Precepts, Thirty-Six Precepts, Seventy-Two Precepts, One Hundred Twenty Precepts, One Hundred Eighty Precepts, Three Hundred Great Precepts, or the Six Hundred Pure Precepts of the Celestial Maidens (女冠六百净戒)**—if one **concentrates with wholehearted sincerity (专心致志)**, **devotes oneself to this precept chapter with unwavering resolve (持此戒品专一，坚固无二)**, **accepts and reveres it in faith (信受尊重)**, **accepts and practices it sincerely (信受奉行)**, **holds it in solemn awe (钦严尊重)**, and **reveres and admires this Scripture (诚敬仰慕是此经典)**, then even if one **only maintains purity, upholds precepts, and accepts them with singular devotion (或作但能清净持戒，专一信受，尊重敬慕读者)**, all are included.\n\nThey shall **participate in fasting rites together (并同修斋)**, and those who **uphold pure precepts (护持净戒者)** shall have **equal merit (功德一般)**. All **deities shall respect and protect them (诸神敬佑)**.\n\nIt is also said that **if one maintains purity and singular devotion (自己清净专一)**, **upholding the pure precepts they have taken (护持所守净戒)**, their **merit shall be unobstructed (是人功德，坦然无碍)**.\n\n*\"Tan\"* means **level (平)**, *\"kuang\"* means **broad (广)**. If the **heart is divided (心有二)**, then **merit is not genuine (功德不实)**. If **precepts are not upheld (戒不持)**, they **taint merit (於功德有玷)**. When **mind and body are pure (心身清净)**, **precepts are upheld with singular devotion (持戒专)**, **acceptance is sincere (信受切)**, and **the Scripture is honored with reverence (尊敬经典)**, with **no attachment in the heart (心无染)**, **no division in the heart (心无二)**, and **no deficiency or obstruction (无有亏欠萦击)**, then **merit is truly genuine (功德真实)**, and **how can there be any obstruction (自是坦然，又有何碍)?** One shall **dwell in freedom and ease (自在逍遥)**.\n\n---\n\nFrom birth, human nature is **unbound and unrestrained (无拘无困)**. Yet when **encumbered by external influences (客感物累)**, one is **busy and labored (忙忙苦苦)**, losing **one’s innate harmony (无复自如)**, and **how can true joy (快乐) be found?**\n\nWhen **the heart is pure and faith is true (清净正信)**, **external burdens are cast aside (无复物累)**, and **great freedom (大自在)** is attained, **joy becomes everlasting (常乐逍遥)**. Such a person is called **the Sage among mortals (人中圣)**, not merely one who **wanders freely (逍遥之人)**.\n\n**Pure and true (消净正信)**, **transcending common humanity (高出人俦)**, this is the **Sage among mortals (人中圣人)**. **Virtue and wisdom are ever renewed (德慧常新)**, **practice aligns with insight (习与智长)**, and **transformation harmonizes with the heart (化与心成)**. When **perception and understanding are true (闻见真)**, **intellect merges with intuition (智虑融)**, and **external burdens are forgotten (物累忘)**, **true nature shines undimmed (性真湛)**.\n\n**Virtue is daily renewed (德日新)**, **wisdom ever brightened (慧日明)**—this is the **ever-renewing virtue and wisdom (德慧常新)**. Those who **share in the true way (同诸真人)** are those who **hold scripture and attain the Dao (清净正信者同持经得道)****,** the **true beings of the heavens (诸天真人)**.\n\nThe **pure and true (清净)**—**upholding precepts (持戒)**, **singular in devotion (专一)**, **sincere in acceptance (信受切)**, **reverent in honoring scripture (尊重敬慕)**—**do so without calculation of merit (非有计功之心)**, nor **for human intent (为人之意)**. Their **actions are without ulterior motive (无所为而为)**, **utterly free from deceit or interruption (绝无虚假间断)**.\n\nThis is as the **Master Kong (孔子)** spoke: **\"In haste or at leisure, no deviation (造次终食，颠沛无违).\"**\nThis is as the *Zhōng Yōng* (《中庸》) states: **\"None enter without finding their own fulfillment (无入而不自得).\"**\nZhuangzi expounded the **essence of *Xiāoyáo* (逍遥)**, and **Bai Jianchuan (海蟾)** sang the **ode of *Kuàihuó* (快活)**.\nThe **Buddhist teaching of Great Freedom (大自在)**, the **Confucian principle of Daily Renewal (日新)**, and **\"Revering the old and knowing the new (温故而知新)\"**—all are **natural manifestations (自然之效)**.\n**How could there be any contrivance or imitation (假借)?** **How could there be any forced adoption (勉强袭取)?**\n\nAh! **Pure and true (清净正信)**, even **without ritual instruction (不依科教)**, nor **observing fasts and offerings (修斋醮)**, **such natural merit (自然功德)** still exists. **Thus, the Dao’s profound essence (道旨玄科)** is **found only in the true substance of scripture (实体经义)**.\n**Ritual instruction, fasts, and offerings (科教斋醮)**—the **Universal Law (普法)**—**are but means to propagate the Dao’s transformation (以演道化)**.\nChen Xiyi (陈希夷) **mocked the *Dù Rén Jīng* (度人经)**, yet **his attainment of the Dao (成道)** was **true adherence to scripture’s essence (盖真持经旨)**.\n\n**Today’s fasts and offerings (斋醮)** lack **clear efficacy (无明效)** because **there are elaborate rites (有盛仪)**, yet **no true cultivation (无真修)**.\nIf **one is pure and true (清净正信)** and **further observes fasts and offerings (更修斋醮)**, then **merit is greatly enhanced (功益大)**.\nWithout **fasts and offerings (无斋醮)**, yet **with true sincerity (有真诚)**, merit **is still divine (功亦神)**.\nIf **sincerity is absent (无真诚)**, then **fasts and offerings (斋醮)** are **mere formalities (文具)**—**how much greater the fault (宁无过乎)!**\n\n**Chapter on Protection (护持品七章)**\nAt that time, the **Celestial Sovereign, Emperor of Heaven (昊天上帝)**, upon hearing these words, **bowed in reverence (稽首)** before the **Celestial Sovereign (帝)** and sang:\n\n**Great is the Supreme Dao (大哉至道)!**\n**Formless and nameless (无形无名).**\n**Vast through countless eons (渺渺亿劫),**\n**The Yellow Way (黄道) opens in purity (开清).**\n\n**Divine purity shines radiant (神清朗耀),**\n**The Nine *Qi* (九炁) exhale their essence (吐精).**\n**The Jade Void (玉虚) glows clear (澄辉),**\n**The Great Mists (太霞) ascend in brilliance (高明).**\n\n**The Jade Sovereign (玉皇) initiates transformation (开化),**\n**Universally nurturing (溥度) all heavenly and human beings (天人).**\n**The Three Primordial Forces (三元) nourish the Dao (道养),**\n**The Two Symbols (二象) encompass all life (摄生).**\n\n**Decayed trees and ancient roots (朽树故根),**\n**Though withered, are made to flourish anew (已枯使荣).**\n**Creeping and crawling beings (蠢动蜎息),**\n**Attain eternal life (长生) and transcend their forms (化形).**\n\n**Those who bear in womb or conceive (怀胎含孕),**\n**All achieve birth and growth (俱得生成).**\n**The departed whose life has passed (亡者命过),**\n**Their spirits return to the Three Pure Ones (魂归三清),**\n**Their *pò* (魄) undergo refinement and liberation (受炼度),**\n**Ascending to the Southern Palace (南宫飞升).**\n\n**Today is a great auspice (今日大吉)!**\n**All are granted radiance (皆得光明).**\n**The Five Emperors (五帝) reflect and mirror (鉴映),**\n**Proclaiming to all sentient beings (普告万灵).**\n\n**Heavenly deities and earthly spirits (天神地祇),**\n**And all river sources (及诸河源),**\n**The Five Sacred Peaks and Four Great Waterways (五岳四渎),**\n**And all named mountains (及诸名山),**\n**The Mystic Void (洞玄), the Mystic Emptiness (洞虚),**\n**The Mystic Abyss (洞空), the Mystic Immortals (洞仙),**\n**The Boundless Greatest Sage (无极大圣),**\n**The Supreme True Venerable Deity (至真尊神),**\n**The Endless and Boundless (无穷无极),**\n**All oversee and liberate beings (溥监度生).**\n\n**Evil roots are severed (恶根断绝),**\n**The Mystic Register records their names (玄都记名).**\n**All true beings gather in ranks (众真班列),**\n**Attending to the Celestial Sovereign’s decree (成听帝言).**\n\n**The Scripture is the Sovereign’s commandment (经是帝勑),**\n**Preserved and chanted by those who uphold humanity (保诵持人).**\n**To the utmost degree of the Dao’s shore (至度道岸),**\n**No calamity shall intrude (无使灾侵).**\n\n**I bear the Sovereign’s mandate (我奉帝命),**\n**All shall heed (一切咸听).**\n\nAt that time, the **Vision of Understanding (解见)** appeared as before. The **Celestial Sovereign, Emperor of Heaven (昊天上帝)**, upon hearing these words, **pointed to the merit of protection (指上护持功德言)** and **bowed in reverence (稽首)** before the **Jade Sovereign (玉帝)** while singing in praise:\n\n**Great is the Supreme Dao (大哉至道)!**\n**Its magnitude is beyond measure (大莫可量),**\n**Its reach is beyond attainment (至不可及).**\n\n**Formless and nameless (无形无名),**\n**Unseen and unheard (不见不闻),**\n**Its name is but a forced designation (名亦强称).**\n\n**Vast through countless eons (渺渺亿劫),**\n**Without beginning or end (无始无终),**\n**Spanning innumerable ages (历劫无数),**\n**A hundred million is called *yì* (亿), yet truly it is beyond number (要之举大数言，实无数耳).**\n\n**The Yellow Way (黄道) opens in purity (开清),**\n**Marking auspicious times and joyous gatherings (吉时庆会),**\n**The Heavenly Dao (天道) is made clear and open (开通).**\n\n**Divine purity shines radiant (神清朗耀),**\n**The divine wind is ever pure (神风永清),**\n**Its brilliance is undimmed (朗耀光明).**\n\n**The Nine *Qi* exhale their essence (九炁吐精):**\n**The Nine *Qi* are *yān* (炎), *yǎn* (演), *hào* (昊), *jǐng* (景), *dào* (道), *hún* (混), *dòng* (洞), *hào* (浩) and others (等).**\n**Exhaling essence (吐精)**—the **Yellow Way opens to dispel death and celebrate rebirth (黄道开死庆消)**,**\n**The Nine *Qi* display their radiance (九炁呈辉),**\n**Exhaling essence in dazzling splendor (吐精炫瑞).**\n\n**The Jade Void (玉虚) glows clear (澄辉),**\n**The Jade Light (玉光) is pure and luminous (虚明),**\n**Its clarity is undimmed (澄然清辉).**\n**Some say the Jade Void (玉虚) manifests the Heavenly Radiance (天呈辉).**\n\n**The Great Mists (太霞)

(度教化).**\n**Universally nurturing (溥度) all beings in heaven and on earth (天上地下人).**\n\n**The Three Primordial Forces (三元) nourish the Dao (道养):**\n**Heaven generates (天生), earth perfects (地成), and humanity is transformed (人教化),**\n**These are the Three Primordial Forces (三元) nurturing the Dao (道养).**\n\n**The Two Symbols (二象) encompass all life (摄生):**\n**The *qián* (乾) and *kūn* (坤) create and transform (造化),**\n**Generating all beings and things (生成人物).**\n**Thus it is said, the Two Symbols encompass all life (终始宰制，故云二象摄生).**\n**Some say the yin and yang mold and refine (陶铸) are the Two Symbols encompassing all life (二象摄生),**\n**Both are correct teachings (俱是正论).**\n\n**Decayed trees and ancient roots (朽树故根):**\n**Decayed (朽), ruined (坏);**\n**Ancient (故), dead (死).**\n**Though

(蠢动蜎息),**\n**Long-lived and transformed in form (长生化形):**\n**The crawling and flying of insects (蜎飞蠕动蠢类),**\n**Not perishing young (生不夭折),**\n**All escape their original forms (俱得脱其本形).**\n\n**Those who bear in womb or conceive (怀胎含孕),**\n**All achieve birth and growth (俱得生成):**\n**The gestation and birth of beings and things (人物胎孕),**\n**Without harm or loss (不伤不堕),**\n**All are granted safe and natural growth (俱得安然，生长而成).**\n\n**The departed whose life has passed (亡者命过),**\n**Their spirits return to the Three Pure Ones (魂归三清):**\n**The dead do not pass through the underworld (死者不经地狱),**\n**All ascend to the heavens (皆归天上).**\n**The *pò* (魄) undergo refinement and liberation (受炼度),**\n**Ascending to the Southern Palace (南宫飞升):**\n**The seven *pò* (七魄) of the dead are

ghosts, and spirits, are thus virtuous.**\n\n**This is the full proclamation of the scripture’s merit.**\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Protection and Upholding**\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Sovereign of the Vaulting Heaven spoke these words and declared to the great assembly:\n*\"This is the Jade Emperor’s wondrous law, the secret speech of the Saints.\nThe path is severed, the Dao is cut off—\nSubtle and unfathomable, its grandeur beyond measure,\nThe true essence of the divine, the root of all numinous power,\nGuarding and pacifying the land, liberating beings from birth and death.\"*\n\nWhen the Celestial Sovereign of the Vaulting Heaven had spoken these wondrous words—\n*\"The assembly of the law, the pure gathering of saints, all revered the Dao’s speech,\nAnd universally attained enlightenment.\"*\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Sovereign of the Vaulting Heaven bowed in homage and praised the Jade Emperor.\nAfter speaking these words, he declared to the celestial sages, true deities, and the great assembly:\n*\"This is the Jade Emperor’s wondrous law.\"*\n\nAll the Saints and Holy Ones possess their own laws—\nSome vast yet measurable, transmitted with limits,\nSome knowable in their beginning and end,\nSome benefit the living yet neglect the dead,\nSome aid humans yet abandon things,\nSome are known to ghosts and spirits,\nSome are not subdued by demons,\nSome are formless and unknown, unable to universally save.\nThese are not wondrous.*\n\nBut this scripture’s transformative power is boundless,\nIts efficacy immeasurable—\nAll who gain its benefit are of an extraordinary order.\n\nThus, the Jade Emperor’s wondrous law,\nThe secret, profound speech of the Saints and True Ones.\nWhen the Primordial began to expound the scripture,\nHow could the Saints and the Most True Ones, upon hearing it,\nNot treasure it and dare not lightly reveal it?\nHence, it is called the *Secret Speech of the Saints.*\n\nThe path is severed, the Dao is cut off—\nThe highest vehicle of all.\nA law not commonly heard,\nThe essential path to True Cultivation,\nThe cyclical practice of the Saints.\nEmotional desires and illusions are uprooted here,\nLove and mundane thoughts are extinguished without remainder.\nThe wheel of rebirth is severed in two—\nThus, it is said: *The path is severed, the Dao is cut off.*\n\nAnother saying: *The Seven Saints were all deluded; this is a path few can tread.*\nSubtle and unfathomable—\nDeep and profound, beyond mortal thought,\nDifficult for the mind to grasp,\nA mystery even gods cannot fathom.\nIts grandeur is vast—\nA wondrous range of celestial chapters,\nThe true essence of divine enlightenment.\n\nAnother explanation: *The Jade Emperor’s Dao-range is the ultimate divine teacher.*\nToo rigid a constraint.\n\nGuarding and pacifying the land,\nLiberating beings from birth and death.\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Sovereign of the Vaulting Heaven,\nHaving spoken this wondrous law—\n*\"The assembly of the law, the pure gathering of saints,*\n*All revered the Dao’s speech—*\n*Some take it as revering the Vaulting Heaven’s wondrous law,*\n*And universally attained enlightenment.\"*\n\n**Verification:**\n*\"The Master’s words on nature and the Dao cannot be heard by all.\"*\n*The Scripture of the Beginning of Writing* says:\n*\"The wise create delusion; even ghosts and spirits do not recognize it.\"*\nThe Buddha spoke on Vulture’s Peak, and the bodhisattvas cupped their ears to listen.\nThe Jade Emperor’s law-speech—\n*The path is severed, the Dao is cut off,*\n*Subtle and unfathomable—*\nWhat cause is there for doubt?\nIt is the root of all divine power,\nPacifying the land, liberating beings from birth and death—\nThis is its natural effect.\n\n**Dispelling Doubts:**\nThere is no one outside the Dao, nor is there a Dao outside humanity.\nAll beings, bright or obscure, are the Dao itself.\nHuman nature is fully true;\nAll things are complete within it.\nAll transformations and nurturing,\nThe beginning and end of the world—\nAll are the true essence of my nature.\n\nThe Jade Emperor is the Dao-body;\nThe scripture is the Dao’s intent.\nOnly through the Dao is divine efficacy and transformation complete,\nMystery and nature inherently perfect.\nHumans share the same essence—\nHow could they not uphold the scripture?\n\nKnow that the Dao resides within—\nWith a single mind, embodying the Dao,\nThrough all lifetimes without division,\nThen the Saints and True Ones are already within me.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine of Protection and Upholding**\n\nThen, the Celestial Worthy spoke this gatha:\n\n*The Jade Emperor’s merit is vast,*\n*The Mystic Principle profoundly deep.*\n*Born before the Great Calamity,*\n*Transforming through ancient and modern times.*\n*Now I expound this wondrous scripture,*\n*Out of compassion for all sentient beings.*\n*This is indeed the most wondrous law,*\n*The merit of merits supreme.*\n*The name is the highest vehicle,*\n*Unmatched, the first of all.*\n\n*The Radiant Sovereign of Great Light,*\n*Whose virtue and power are rare in the world,*\n*Can shatter violent evil demons,*\n*And make all hearts submit in surrender.*\n*Can extinguish the gravest crimes,*\n*And grant all purity.*\n\n*If one hears this scripture,*\n*Or hears the Emperor’s wondrous name,*\n*And bows in reverence,*\n*All sins are annihilated.*\n\n*The Ten Evils and Four Grave Offenses,*\n*Even matricide and patricide—*\n*With sincere faith, a single invocation,*\n*All vanish with the sound.*\n\n*Protecting humans and celestial beings,*\n*The Four Calamities and Five Decays,*\n*The Three Realms’ gravest sufferings,*\n*Mundane human misfortunes,*\n*Years of famine, pestilence, and death,*\n*Poisons, nightmares, and malevolent spirits,*\n*Lawsuits, wrongful accusations,*\n*Warfare and battlefield torments,*\n*Perils in mountains and forests,*\n*Tigers, leopards, wolves, and their kind,*\n*The venomous red seas and dragon-kind,*\n*Swift lightning, wind, hail, and storms,*\n*Fires, floods, thieves, and robbers,*\n*Internal poisons and treacherous plots,*\n*Madness and loss of reason,*\n*Snakes, scorpions, and venomous insects,*\n*Malevolent demons and monstrous spirits,*\n*Those who lurk for human harm—*\n*By holding this true scripture,*\n*All such evils universally disperse and vanish.*\n\n*Chronic illnesses, lingering and tormenting,*\n*Even in dreams, no peace is found,*\n*Unnatural desires that drain life—*\n*These perish without blame.*\n\n*Through encountering this scripture,*\n*One attains security and freedom.*\n*All desires and aspirations—*\n*Wealth, treasures, and noble status—*\n*Through this scripture’s merit,*\n*All are fulfilled as one wishes.*\n\nThe Celestial Sovereign of Divine Might and Freedom,\nThe Eleven Luminaries of the Celestial Hosts,\nThe Thirty-two Heavenly Lords,\nThe Twenty-eight Constellations of Stars,\nThe Spirit Consorts and Jade Maidens and their kind,\nCelestial Deities and Earthly Spirits,\nThe Gods of the Three Realms and Void,\nThe Dragon Kings of rivers and seas,\nThe Spirits of Water, Fire, and Wind,\nPalaces and dwellings, mountains and forests,\nTrees and all their kind,\nThe Spirits of ditches, canals, wells, and springs—\nBy holding this true scripture,\nAll shall protect and defend.\n\nClothing and food come naturally,\nChildren and descendants attain wealth and nobility.\nWords spoken are rare and revered,\nWherever one goes, all honor and respect.\n\nIf one seeks sons or daughters,\nBy reciting this true scripture,\nAn imperial edict descends to the Celestial Bureau,\nRegistering them as Heavenly Immortals,\nDescending to be born in their family,\nTo become their sons or daughters.\n\nNobles and the eminent hold them in high regard,\nThe Seven Ancestors ascend in rank.\nThe family’s glory shines brightly,\nExtending blessings to parents and kin.\nConstant auspiciousness thrives unceasingly,\nDisasters and calamities cannot intrude.\n\nThus, I now proclaim—\nThe assembly must listen with earnest attention.\nWith boundless compassion, all are led to the Highest Purity.\n\nThe following verses were spoken by the Primordial Celestial Venerable:\n\n*The Jade Emperor’s virtue is vast,*\n*The Mysterious Principle profound and deep.*\n*Born before the Great Calamity,*\n*Manifesting through ancient and modern ages.*\n*I, the Primordial, now speak this wondrous scripture,*\n*Out of pity for all sentient beings,*\n*The highest virtue among virtues,*\n*The unparalleled wondrous law,*\n*The foremost Mysterious Mechanism.*\n\n*The Radiant Sovereign of Great Light,*\n*Light infinite, the Awakened King Supreme.*\n*Might and virtue rare in the world,*\n*Mysterious Might and Marvelous Virtue—*\n*The world cannot compare.*\n\n*The Ten Evils and Fourfold Heavy Sins,*\n*The Fourfold Heavy Sins—some say: Demon, Prison, Ghost, Beast.*\n*Others say: Struck by lightning, plague, thieves, and prisons.*\n*The Five Grievous Offenses against parents.*\n*As Mencius said, the Five Unfilial Acts:*\n*Laziness in limbs, indulging in gambling and drink,*\n*Greed for wealth, favoring one’s own wife and children,*\n*Following ear and eye desires,*\n*To the point of killing one’s parents,*\n*Or reckless bravery endangering them.*\n*Others say: Lack of sincerity, filial piety, obedience, and propriety—these are the Five Offenses.*\n\n*With faith, invoking the Emperor’s name,*\n*Crimes vanish with each utterance.*\n\n*The Five Decays:*\n*The crown of pearls shatters, the body bends,*\n*The head bows, eyes dim, nose leaks,*\n*The body loses luster,*\n*The Celestial Robe is tattered,*\n*The shadow is exposed,*\n*The spirit’s movement becomes sluggish.*\n*These are the signs of fate’s convergence.*\n\n*Kluster (克家): When past karma meets its due.*\n*Derzhin (迅): Swift as lightning.*\n*Bao (雹): Hail, icy rain.*\n*Si (伺): Lurking in darkness to harm others.*\n*Those who harm themselves through unnatural desires—*\n*They perish utterly, not as misfortune.*\n\n*The Four Directions, the Eight, and the Thirty-two Heavenly Lords.*\n*Those who hold this scripture speak in Mysterious Marvels,*\n*Words rare and revered,*\n*Wherever they go, all honor them with sincere respect.*\n\n*The Seven Ancestors:*\n*The father, grandfather, great-grandfather, high-ancestor,*\n*The ancestral root, the ancestor who opened the forest,*\n*The ancestor who established the surname—these are the Seven Ancestors.*\n\n*Fluxing Victory (炽胜): Great radiance and display.*\n*With boundless compassion, all are led to the Highest Purity,*\n*The Great Luo Realm.*\n\n*This verse extols the Jade Emperor’s virtue in the Jade Scripture,*\n*Urging all to revere and uphold it.*\n\n**Chapter Ten: Protection and Upholding**\n\nThus, the Celestial Venerable addressed the Four Assemblies:\n*\"For mortals who hold and recite this scripture,*\n*Who receive and invoke the Emperor’s name,*\n*All are rooted deeply in the Dao,*\n*With past merits of kindness.*\n*This scripture is sublime and noble,*\n*Universal salvation for Heaven and humanity.*\n*With sincere devotion, families and nations prosper,*\n*Life is preserved, disasters averted,*\n*All inauspiciousness is swept away.*\n\n*When kings and nobles uphold it,*\n*The land achieves great peace,*\n*Bandits and rebels are subdued,*\n*Borderlands remain undisturbed,*\n*The people sing in joy,*\n*All under Heaven thrives,*\n*Fate’s cycles turn favorably,*\n*The True Way prevails.*\n*Those who possess it are held in reverence by the Celestial Worthies.*\n*It is a treasure to be guarded in secrecy.\"*\n\nThus, the Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the Four Assemblies:\n\n*\"All mortals in this world who hold and recite this scripture, receiving and invoking the Sacred Emperor’s name, are deeply rooted in the Dao—just as the Confucian sage speaks of innate endowment pure and profound, or as the Buddhist speaks of favorable roots and capacity. They bear past merits of kindness, having in former ages and past kalpas broadly cultivated hidden virtue, already possessing auspicious connections.\n\nFor the True Way is difficult to hear, the Dharma Assembly rare to encounter, and the blessed night even rarer to meet. Some have lived through ages without hearing the True Dharma; some hear yet do not believe or awaken, failing to grasp it fully or reap its true benefit. These are those whose roots and capacity are shallow, whose karmic connections are thin.\n\nNow, in this Dharma Assembly, hearing the True Dharma and receiving its true benefit—all have through countless kalpas cultivated the Dao, their roots deeply established, their past merits profound. This scripture is sublime and noble, universally saving Heaven and humanity. But with sincere devotion, reverent offering, and humble veneration of this scripture, families and nations achieve peace, life is preserved and disasters averted, longevity secured and calamities dispelled.\n\nThe ancient sages and worthies had birth and death, faced disasters and misfortune—how could they claim to preserve life and avert disasters? Rather, they preserved the Heavenly Mandate and maintained true *qi*, enduring trials with daily ease, meeting death with serenity, finding no distinction between joy and sorrow. This is the true meaning of preserving life and averting disasters through the scripture.\n\nIt sweeps away all inauspiciousness—where the scripture’s power resides, all calamities vanish in secret. The virtuous receive Heaven’s favor, and all disasters are forever removed, leaving no trace of ill fortune.\n\nAs for kings and nobles: the sovereign of all under Heaven is called the *Son of Heaven* (天子), the *Emperor* (皇), or the *Sage Emperor* (帝). In the Zhou, they were called *Kings* (王). In later times, a feudal lord ruling a single state is called a *King* (王), and a vassal holding a fief is called a *Marquess* (侯). In antiquity, a marquess ruled over a hundred *li*.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture bring their nation’s lineage to great peace. Bandits and rebels are naturally subdued—*subdued* meaning pacified. When a land follows the Dao, internal harmony and external might prevail; wicked rebels and bandits do not rise, and the four borderlands submit in tribute, all under Heaven at ease, with no wars on the frontiers. The common folk sing in joy, the land prosperous and at peace, all under Heaven flourishing.\n\nThe celestial cycles turn favorably, the *Zhenyuan* era’s auspicious rotation complete, the natural order restored. Those who possess this Dharma and embody its transformative power are held in reverence by the Celestial Worthies. It is a treasure to be guarded in secrecy—though the Great Dao universally saves all, the unworthy should not be given it lightly. The Buddha’s *True Dharma Eye Treasury* is not casually revealed to all. Confucius said: ‘Those of mediocre or lesser capacity cannot be taught the highest truths.’ True understanding must come from the heart. To treat it lightly is to profane the Heavenly.\n\nThe scripture says *guard it in secrecy*—let those who observe it understand its meaning on their own.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Five: The Manifestation of Retribution and Verification**\n\nAt that time, the Four Venerable Ones—Compassionate Transcendence of Calamities, Seeking-Voice Savior of Suffering, Life-Saving Death-Transcending, and Ten-Thousand Blessings Body-Protecting—all rose from their seats, stepping beyond their ranks, and together addressed the Celestial Venerable:\n\n*'In the latter ages, though mortals may bear past merits and encounter this scripture, if obstructed by malevolent influences—whether from their own heretical views, others’ deceptive teachings, perverse natures, or the hindrances of circumstance and principle—they remain doubtful from beginning to end, unable to believe in this scripture’s virtues. Such persons, in this life and future lives, will suffer what retributive punishments in the hells? We humbly pray the Saintly Compassion may explain the agonies of their retributive realms of suffering.'*\n\nThe Four Venerable Ones—Compassionate Transcendence of Calamities, Seeking-Voice Savior of Suffering, Life-Saving Death-Transcending, and Ten-Thousand Blessings Body-Protecting—all rose from their seats, stepping beyond the ranks of the gods, and together addressed the Primordial Celestial Venerable:\n\n*'In the latter ages, though mortals may bear past merits and encounter this scripture, if obstructed by malevolent influences—whether from their own heretical views, others’ deceptive teachings, perverse natures, or the hindrances of circumstance and principle—they remain doubtful from beginning to end, unable to believe in this scripture’s virtues. Such persons, in this life and future lives, will suffer what retributive punishments in the hells? We humbly pray the Saintly Compassion, the Celestial Venerable, may explain the agonies of their retributive realms of suffering.'*\n\nAll beings bear karmic consciousness, each drawn to their own inclinations—whether good or evil, endlessly cycling through rebirth, unable to escape. The Great Saints and Perfect Ones transcend past habits, uproot defilements, purify consciousness and karma, sever all realms of existence, and with all obstructions removed, suffer no retribution or rebirth.\n\nThe great bodhisattvas, minor immortals, minor saints, divine generals, and ghostly spirits—those of virtue take cultivation as their path, those of vice are bound by their deeds. Virtuous beings need no further mention; the wicked, however, sink into their karmic prisons, their retributions endless, with no escape or remedy. When their karma is exhausted, they are reborn elsewhere, only to be dragged again by karmic ties, lost in delusion, wandering through kalpas without end. Such is their karmic fate—truly pitiful.\n\nThe Four Venerable Ones, moved by great compassion, implored the Celestial Venerable to speak of these retributive sufferings.\n\nNow, regarding the teachings on retribution: Confucian scholars deny it not. *Tai Jia* said: *\"When Heaven inflicts calamity, it may still be averted; when a man brings calamity upon himself, there is no escape.\"* The classics say: *\"Reward the virtuous, punish the licentious.\"* And again: *\"The responses of Heaven and man are swift as echoes.\"* How could they deny retribution?\n\nThe Master said: *\"The gentleman cherishes the penal codes.\"* And again: *\"Fear the Heavenly Mandate.\"* Thus, he does not himself do evil. When Dao and righteousness delight the heart, there is no other path.\n\nIn past dynasties, at the *xiangyin* and archery rites, they taught the people through lectures on law and order, guiding them not by coercion but by nurturing their inherent goodness.\n\n「The teachings of both Dao and Buddhism on retribution and penal codes serve only to uproot their karmic inclinations and lead them toward great virtue. Alas! Only the sage, through divine instruction and governance, commands the reverence of all.\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s merit and virtue are supreme, hence the scriptures clearly demonstrate retribution to rescue beings from evil paths, never deceiving the multitude. If one does not cultivate the True Dao, but merely dazzles others with talk of reward and punishment, this is to deceive them. Those who study the scriptures must renounce desire and attain the True Dao to escape personal retribution and suffering, only then can they save and guide the world.\n\nThe *Yingying* [應驗] chapters continue with twelve more sections. At that time, the Heavenly Sage addressed the Four True Ones [四真人], saying: *\"If there are beings in the world who are obstinate, fierce, and cruel—unbenevolent creatures whose speech and deeds harm all beings—who day and night face the Daoist images without reverence, uttering blasphemous words, they shall incur the crime of falling into the Five Boundless [五無間] Prisons.*\n\nIf they encounter one who holds this scripture, who employs all means to persuade, guide, and rescue them, then such beings—able to extinguish their evil thoughts, take faith in this scripture, and purify all their crimes without remainder—shall be redeemed. At that time, the Original Heavenly Sage addressed the Four True Ones of Compassionate Salvation and Deliverance [慈悲度厄等四真人], saying:\n\n*\"If there are beings in the world who are obstinate, fierce, and cruel—those bold and coarse in name, unbenevolent beings whose speech and deeds harm all beings—who day and night face the Daoist images without reverence, uttering blasphemous words, they shall incur the crime of falling into the Five Boundless [五無間] Prisons. The Five Prisons are the great penal realms of the Underworld; non-sages have no recourse, thus they fall into these crimes. Observe the solar laws [陽律] for blasphemous slander, and you shall know the gravity of slandering the divine.\n\nIf they encounter one who holds this scripture, who employs all means to save and guide them, then those who defy the divine and slander the scriptures have deep-rooted karmic tendencies, clinging stubbornly to their delusions, lacking faith. The scripture-holder, through boundless compassion and skillful means, awakens, persuades, and leads them, revealing their true nature, fostering benevolent thoughts. Thus, those who defy the divine and slander the scriptures, if they extinguish all their evil thoughts, take faith in this scripture, and devote themselves wholly to it, shall have their crimes purified without remainder. Their karmic debts shall be erased, retribution fulfilled, and they shall forever be free from transgression, never returning to cyclic suffering, always pure and clear, with evil retribution forever removed and no unresolved karmic debts remaining.\n\nThe Five Boundless [五無間] hells—where crimes are difficult to purify—if one steadfastly takes faith in the True Scriptures, the evil roots shall be severed, all defilements extinguished, and what bonds remain? The roots and defilements shall be utterly destroyed, with no karmic residue. The divine virtue and scriptural efficacy are the greatest benefits; both Dao and Buddhism emphasize crimes of retribution, sternly warning against defying the divine and slandering the scriptures.\n\nConfucian scholars often admonish irreverence toward spirits and gods—does this mean Confucians do not revere the divine or honor scriptures? The *Book of Odes* states: *\"Do not disgrace your birth.\"* Master Zhang [張子] says: *\"To not fear the gods peering through the roof beams is to disgrace your birth.\"* Again, it says: *\"Cultivate the heart and nurture the nature, without negligence.\"* The teachings of both Dao and Buddhism speak of revering the divine, honoring the scriptures, and fostering the heart to cultivate the Dao, never falling short in devotion to Heaven, Earth, and the divine, and embodying the scriptures’ truth.\n\nConfucians teach that one should not flatter the gods, warning only against seeking rewards through improper reverence. Serving Heaven means fearing Heaven’s mandate, aspiring to Heaven’s will, and honoring the teachings of the ancient kings, with solemn respect like a swift-chariot race or a galloping steed—Confucianism and the two teachings are one in this regard. If sacrifices bring no benefit, reverence is insufficient, and the mandate of Heaven is not to be feared, these are hollow words. Confucian scholars also condemn them sternly—why single out the other two traditions?\n\nAlas! Benevolence and malevolence, reverence and neglect, all arise from the heart. If one can sever emotional desires, abandon worldly perceptions, empty the Five Aggregates [五蘊], and remove the Five Fetters [五累], then one shall not be bound by the Five Elements [五行], nor by Heaven and Earth, and the Five Boundless [五無間] Prisons shall not touch them. The Buddha says: *\"To chant the Buddha’s name transforms the fiery pit into a lotus pond.\"* Mencius says: *\"To recite the words of Yao and follow Yao’s deeds is to be Yao himself.\"* Thus, the true efficacy of virtue and goodness is immediately manifest.\n\nThe *Imperial Canon with Commentaries* [皇經集注] concludes Volume Eight and begins Volume Nine.»\n\n**Chapter Thirteen of the *Verification Section* (Continued)**\n\nIf there be one with perverse views, foolish obstinacy, and malevolent intent—who, upon seeing this scripture held, gives rise to all manner of hostility—with sidelong, malevolent glances, even to the point of harboring a single evil thought or uttering a single evil word, and falsely slandering those who uphold this scripture, then his guilt is profound and grave. When his life expires, he shall fall into the Great Earthly Prison, with no hope of release.\n\nNot only is the crime of blaspheming the sacred and slandering the scripture grave. If there be one with perverse views, foolish and muddled, ensnared in delusion—who, upon seeing those who recite this scripture (for *sight* is *seeing*), harbors doubt and disbelief—then he fails to recognize that this scripture is the Dao’s true words, its laws, and its teachings. He holds it in contempt, belittles it, and in aversion, slanders and defames it. He gives rise to transgressions and rebellious deeds, casting sidelong, askew glances, taking no pleasure in seeing the scripture or those who uphold it. He lacks the steadfast, pure gaze of right observation, but instead fixes his gaze with malice, scorns and despises it, even to the point of harboring a single evil thought or uttering a single evil word, falsely slandering those who uphold this scripture.\n\n*Slander* is both praise and defamation. To uphold the scripture and do good cannot be defamed. Yet those with perverse fixation and malice, ignorant of the karmic causes of guilt and merit, unaware of the virtue of holding this scripture, falsely give rise to slanderous, abusive words against those who uphold it. Their guilt is profound and grave.\n\nWhen his life is *exhausted*—for *exhausted* means *ended*—\n\nFalling into the Great Hell—**Avīci**—the **Uninterrupted Prison**, with no term for release. *Permanent* means *eternal*, *endless*. Through false slander of the True Dharma, the karmic roots are profound and heavy; thus, one falls into hell and finds it difficult to escape.\n\nFor **cognition** is singular. If perception is not upright, it becomes perverse. Humanity is singular; if one clings in delusion and fails to awaken, one becomes **foolish**, becomes **evil**. The heart is singular; if it gives rise to malevolent thoughts, it becomes **rebellious**. The eyes are singular; if they gaze askew, it becomes **transgression**. A single thought, though minute, is singular—if one harbors a single evil intention, it becomes the root of karmic cause. A single word, though few, is singular—if one utters a single evil speech, it becomes the origin of sin.\n\nThe **Noble One** perfects the singular virtue, praises others’ goodness, and those who uphold the scripture should be commended. Yet to falsely give rise to slander is to invite calamity upon oneself. Human life originally has no inherent karmic debt—one incurs guilt through self-inflicted transgression, and this is truly lamentable.\n\nWhen life is *exhausted*—for *exhausted* means *ended*—one returns to the cycle of transformation, bound by no fixed constraint. Yet even a single instance of slandering the Dharma casts one into the Great Hell, where death itself brings no peace. How then can one escape without end?\n\nHeaven’s heart is benevolent and loving; the **Supreme Sovereign** cherishes life, and the **Divine** is just, not drowning the people. Yet those who commit crimes with no hope of release—is this Heaven’s imprisonment? The calamity is self-made; fixed karma cannot be evaded. To eliminate one’s own karmic debt, one must rely on self-rectification. If one steadfastly pursues the utmost goodness, the karmic roots will be severed.\n\nAlas! The punishments of hell are Heaven’s retribution; the law is impartial—no father can shield his son, nor a filial child spare his parent. The Divine is utterly just; how could it erase self-inflicted karmic consequences?\n\nIf one takes refuge in the scripture and turns toward the Dharma, sincerely repents past transgressions—just as a worldly person who surrenders in truth may be spared their crime—then one may escape.\n\nIn this mortal life, the wise and foolish differ not in essence. If one cannot speak with measured words, let one’s voice conform to the **Laws**; yet do not utter falsehoods as **evil speech**. If one cannot act without fault, let one’s body be the **Measure**; yet do not commit **evil deeds** and incur bodily karmic debt. If one cannot keep the mind free from delusion, guarding the **Ultimate Truth**, then do not give rise to malevolent intentions and incur mental karmic debt.\n\nIf one does not know the **Great Dao**, do not slander the **Way**; if one does not understand the scripture, do not contradict it; if one cannot recite and uphold it, do not slander others; if one does not comprehend the **ghostly**, **life and death**, **cause and effect**, do not give rise to destructive speech. With a single mind of upright faith, one will gradually illuminate the **One Dao**, becoming a **Sage of Truth**—what karmic guilt could then remain?\n\n---\n**Verification Chapter (Continuation of the Fourteen Chapters)**\n\nAs for men and women in this world who encounter this scripture yet do not generate reverence, defiling it with unclean hands, reading aloud with a **polluted mouth**—one who has consumed the **Five Impurities** and **Five Spices**, or who places it upon an impure bed or seat—such treatment is utterly improper. Or if one recites this scripture while engaging in idle conversation, laughing and jesting as if it were a mundane text, treating it as a common classic—such a person, after death, falls into the **Uninterrupted Prison**, with no term for release. Their suffering extends to their **Nine Ancestors**, subjecting them to the **Tribunal of the Underworld**, entangling their descendants and harming future generations.\n\nIn hell, they endure unimaginable torments across countless **kalpas**. Even if they encounter sacred teachings and are repeatedly rescued, their sins diminish only slightly. If they then meet the **Supreme Sage’s special grace**, they may escape hell and be reborn as a **Hungry Ghost**, enduring for thousands of millions of **kalpas** without even hearing the name of **porridge**. Once their ghostly karmic debt is exhausted, they are reborn among **Animals**, and upon fulfilling that debt, if they are reborn as humans, they are cast into **barbaric lands**, reduced to **female form**, plagued by poverty, suffering, deformity, and countless diseases. They endure unbearable torments, despised by all, neither able to live nor die. This is the retribution for treating this scripture with contempt.\n\nThis is the **uttermost consequence of disrespecting the scripture**. To fail to generate reverence means to lack **respect, admiration, and veneration**. To defile it with unclean hands means to handle or point to the scripture with impure hands. To recite with a **polluted mouth** is to read while one’s mouth is tainted by the **Five Impurities** and **Five Spices**, or by the **Three Taboos**. To place it upon an impure bed or seat means to rest the scripture upon an unclean couch, table, or platform. Or to recite this scripture while speaking in **vulgar language**, laughing and jesting as if it were a trivial text—such a person not only incurs their own karmic retribution but also brings calamity upon their **Nine Ancestors**: the **First Ancestor**, the **Four昭 (Zhāo)**, and the **Four穆 (Mù)**.\n\nThey are subjected to the **Tribunal of the Underworld**—either **investigated for their transgressions** or **tortured**—as lesser spirits punish the household head for offenses. Their suffering extends to their descendants, entangling future generations. A family burdened with misdeeds faces additional calamity, enduring great torment and boundless affliction. Even if they encounter sacred teachings and are repeatedly rescued, their sins diminish only slightly—this is the merit of the scripture’s power reducing their guilt. If they then meet the **Supreme Sage’s special grace**, the **Divine’s pardon**, they may escape hell’s torments. As **Hungry Ghosts**, they suffer for thousands of millions of **kalpas**, their throats too narrow to swallow even the name of **porridge**. Once their ghostly karmic debt is exhausted, they are reborn among **Animals**, their karmic burden still unresolved.\n\nThough humanity is singular, one may struggle to be reborn in **China**, let alone as a **male**. Instead, they are cast into **barbaric lands**, reduced to **female form**—the least favored state among humans. They endure **poverty, cold, hunger, and hardship**, **deformity, disease, and endless suffering**, despised by all. They neither attain birth nor escape death, all because they treated this scripture with contempt. To incur such grave karmic guilt—how lamentable!\n\nHuman life is a participant in the **Three Powers of Heaven and Earth**, this body precious, relying on it to honor ancestors and benefit descendants, transmitting the **Dao** and sustaining what is entrusted—its weight is not slight. Yet to disrespect the scripture and the Dharma brings suffering upon oneself, entangles one’s ancestors, and dooms future generations. To endure such karmic retribution—how utterly foolish!\n\nAgain, examining the scriptures of the **Three Teachings**, it is said that the **fundamental nature** of male and female is undifferentiated—everywhere, in all places, they are lands of **bliss**. The *Zhongyong* states:\n\n*\"In wealth or poverty, in high or low station, in peace or adversity,\nTo act in accordance with one’s proper place—\nThen one finds contentment in all circumstances.\"*\n\nYet now it speaks of those in **foreign lands** as female forms, bearing bodies of **sickness and hardship**, despised by all—why is this so?\n\nIt is because the **undifferentiated** attain **self-realization**—this is the **Dao**.\nTo distinguish by ranks and speak of **guilt and reward**—this is **retribution**.\nWhen retribution is clear, then people will strive to do good.\n\nAlas! Humans are all the same—all may become virtuous beings.\nStrive earnestly to advance the **Way**, avoid **karmic offenses**, lest you become an object of hatred.\n\n**Continuation of the *Yinying* Chapter (Chapter 15):**\n\nThere are yet others who, though initially **faithful and receptive**, later grow **neglectful and careless**. The **Children of Virtue and Vice** then report them to the **Three Officials**, their names recorded in the **Black Ledger**, their merits subtracted from the **Blue Register**. After death, they are confined to **dark prisons**, wandering the **Three Realms** without escape.\n\nSome, in this very life, suffer **various diseases**—**scabies, leprosy, carbuncles, and ulcers**—as their **fruit of retribution**. They are tormented by **grief and anguish**, day and night.\n\nOr they are **slain by violence**, or imprisoned in chains, or meet **untimely death** by poison. Some are devoured by **tigers, wolves, venomous snakes**, or dragged by **grievous debts**. Some, wandering in forests, are **murdered by bandits** and cast into ravines. Others are **harmed by malevolent spirits and demons**, or perish in **fires and floods**, or are **slaughtered by blades and weapons**.\n\nBecause they **despised this scripture**, their lives are cut short in **premature death**, reaping such **fruit**, such **retribution**—how can one not grieve?\nHow can one not lament?\n\nThe **benefits of this scripture’s law** are not merely for those who **utterly reject faith**. There are also those who, though initially **faithful without doubt**, later grow **remiss and careless**. The **Children of Virtue and Vice**—those who record the **good and evil deeds of mortals**—report them to the **Three Officials**, their names inscribed in the **Black Ledger**.\n\nThe **Black Ledger** records **transgressions**.\nIt records the **guilt of neglecting sacred scriptures**.\nThe **Blue Register** subtracts the **merits** of those who **despise the scriptures**. After death, they are **imprisoned in dark dungeons**, bound in **judicial chains**, wandering the **Three Realms** in endless suffering, with no means of liberation.\n\nThe **karmic fruits** of this life may manifest as **various afflictions**—**scabies, leprosy, festering sores, and malignant diseases**—as **retribution for past misdeeds**. **Anxiety, sorrow, and torment** assail them day and night, **grinding them in despair**. Or they may suffer **sudden calamities and misfortunes**, **imprisonment in chains**, or **untimely death by their own hand**. Or they may be **maimed by poison**, **devoured by tigers, wolves, or venomous serpents**. Or they may be **dragged into ruin by creditors**, or **slain by bandits in the wilderness**, **thrown from cliffs**, their bodies and lives shattered. Or they may be **harmed by malevolent spirits and demons**. Or they may perish in **fires or floods**, or be **slaughtered by blades and spears**. Through **neglect of this scripture**, they **meet a premature end**, **cut down in their prime**, **dying without fulfillment**.\n\nTo suffer such **karmic consequences**, to endure such **retribution**—how can one not grieve? How can one not lament?\n\nWhen one **laments their suffering**, one also **regrets their folly**—this is the **great compassion of the Celestial Sage**.\n\n**Verification of Doubt:**\nHe who **later grows remiss and careless** toward this scripture shall face **endless punishments**. Thus, one must **revere the Dao and uphold the scriptures**, **treasuring constancy**. When the **Dao’s transformation is complete**, the **scripture’s efficacy is fulfilled**, and all shall **reap its virtue**, **attaining its effects**.\n\nYet humans lack constancy—**diligent at first, slack at last**—so it is no wonder that **guilt and misdeeds befall them**. From ancient times to now, the **unworthy have always existed**; many **do not uphold the scripture**, many **have never heard it**, yet those who suffer **guilt and calamities are countless**. Are they all **those who despise the scripture**?\n\nThe scripture **speaks of the Dao**; if one **does not believe in the Dao**, they lack **virtue**—this is **despising the scripture**. Without virtue, there is **guilt**—this is the **sin of despising the scripture**. To **honor the scripture and dissolve guilt**, one must **advance in the Dao and cultivate virtue**.\n\n**Continuation of the Verification Chapter (16):**\nYou must **earnestly follow** this and **practice it diligently**, **generating no wicked thoughts**. If **all thoughts cease**, all **worldly ties are extinguished**; **dust-like malevolent deeds** vanish with the mind, and **all disasters and demons are naturally eradicated**.\n\nThis scripture’s **merits and virtues are beyond measure**—**truly the supreme, matchless, wondrous law**, the **king of all scriptures**, with **great benefit**. **Do not reveal it to the unworthy.**\n\nThe Celestial Sage said to the **True Ones**:\n*\"The retribution for despising the scripture is as such. You must **earnestly and sincerely** follow this scripture’s law without fail, **generating no wicked thoughts.** If **all impure thoughts do not arise**, neither **good nor evil**, neither **non-thought nor non-non-thought**, all **worldly ties are extinguished**—\n\n**Emptying the Five Bonds**, **clearing the Nine Consciousnesses**, **transcending the Four Symbols**, **severing the Hundred Defilements**, **emptying the Ten Thousand Phenomena**, **annihilating the One Mind**—**external ties, internal ties, karmic ties, ties of fortune**—all **empty, pure, and wondrous**—**past lives, present lives, clinging to the future**—**all are severed**. **All roots and dust are exhausted**; **dust-like malevolent deeds** vanish with the mind.\n\nThe **dust of the world**, like the **sands of the Ganges**, is **incalculable**. Thus, **all such deeds**, with the **faith in this scripture**, **are all dissolved**. **All disasters and demons are naturally eradicated**; **all calamities and demons are utterly destroyed**.\n\nThis scripture’s **merits and virtues are beyond measure**—**truly the supreme, matchless, wondrous law**. **All Three Teachings, all laws—none can compare**. This is **truly the supreme, wondrous law**, the **king of all scriptures**, the **scripture of the Two Gates**. **All other books—even those of the Confucian scholars—fall short**. It is the **king of all Three Teachings’ scriptures**, with **great benefit**. **Do not reveal it to the unworthy.**\n\nThough the **Dao may be learned by all**, it **cannot be transmitted to those without faith or reverence**. **Do not reveal it to the unworthy**; **do not transmit it to those who do not hold the Dao in high regard.**\n\n**Resolution of Doubt:**\nThe **Confucian scholars do not instruct the self-destructive**. The **Buddha does not enlighten the unworthy**. The **Dao’s law is most exalted**—how could it be **forced upon the faithless?**\n\nAlas! **Faith is the foundation for advancing in the Dao**; **true resolve is essential for attaining sainthood**. Without faith, one **cannot be entrusted with the scripture**. **Humans must strive with utmost sincerity**, making it the **root of receiving the scripture and entering sainthood.**\n\n**Continuation of the Verification Chapter (17):**\nIf **celestial beings and humans**, facing the **Five Decays and Four Phases of Decline**, are **beset by the wheel of rebirth**, yet **abandon all delusions** and **uphold this scripture**, they will **naturally attract blessings**, **fortifying their celestial fortune**, **transcending the Three Realms**, and **abiding with the Dao eternally**.\n\nThis scripture is **most exalted**—**it should not be recklessly revealed to all**.\n\nIf **celestial beings and humans** of the **Six Desire Realms** still **cling to sensual pleasures**, those of the **Eighteen Color Realms** **retain colored forms**, those of the **Four Formless Realms** **find bliss in emptiness**, and those of the **Four Great Brahmas**—though **knowing emptiness and non-existence**, lacking **hopes of delight**—yet **enjoy tranquil blessings in measure**—all these **celestial realms**, though **differing in kind**, are **inferior to the Four Celestial Kindreds**, who **know no rebirth or decay**.\n\nThe **Five Decays** have been explained before. The **Four Phases** refer to:\n- The **decline of non-humans, humans, beings, and long-lived ones** in **fortune and virtue** (four phases).\n- Or **birth, vigor, old age, and exhaustion** (four phases).\n- Or **lack of dignity, lack of supernatural powers, lack of joy, lack of vitality** (four phases).\n\nThe **wheel of rebirth presses upon them**—the **thirty-two heavens of Desire, Form, Brahmas, and Formlessness**, differing in **duration**. When their **celestial blessings are exhausted**, they **reincarnate into the mortal world**, each with **fixed destiny**—hence, **\"rebirth.\"**\n\n**Abandoning all delusions** means:\nDelusion arises from **clinging to worldly ties**—whether **coveting blessings, wisdom, longevity, emptiness, meditation, ascension, or descent**. What the **eyes cannot see**, what the **mind cannot exhaust**—all are **delusion**. To **abandon all thoughts**, to **let no single tie arise**, to **be empty of emptiness**—this is **abandoning illusory thoughts**.\n\nWhen **delusion is abandoned**, one **naturally attracts blessings**; **celestial fortune is fortified**—**without seeking, blessings come naturally**.\n\nThe **Four Realms**—Desire, Form, Formless, and Brahmalokas—each **allows one to transcend from their own abode**.\n\n**No longer subject to rebirth**, they **suffer no ruin or decline**, achieving **great firmness and stability**, never entering the cycle of rebirth.\n\n**Liberating the body from the Three Realms**:\nTo **exit the Desire Realm**, ascend to the Form Realm, and further reach the Formless and Brahmalokas—**transcending the Three Realms of existence** (samsara)—one **soars beyond the forms of heaven, earth, and humanity**, attaining the **lofty, mysterious heights**.\n\n**Eternal alongside the Dao**:\nIn **harmony with the Dao**, they **endure through boundless ages**. Observing the **transformative power of celestial and human scriptures**, one may **grasp the truth**.\n\n**Exhortation**: The **Eighteen Chapters of the *Yingpin* Sutra** are this very scripture—**unmatched and unsurpassable**, possessing **great awe-inspiring virtue and power**, a **mighty divine spell**—capable of **reviving withered branches and leaves**, making **flowers and fruits flourish abundantly**. It can **banish the most profound suffering and afflictions of all beings**, and **grant long life to those with short spans**.\n\nThis scripture’s **merits and virtues are beyond reckoning**, praise **cannot exhaust them**.\n\nFor those who **do not believe in this scripture**, their **karma is thus**; for **celestial and human beings who trust it**, its **effects are thus**. This scripture is **unmatched and unsurpassable**; all other **sutras and teachings** fall beneath it, **none equal**, **none superior**. All benefits of other scriptures and teachings **cannot compare** to this, **none surpass it**.\n\nThis is **great awe-inspiring virtue and power**—**either eliminating evil or supporting the true**. If a teaching **cannot both eliminate evil and extinguish sins while upholding the true and perfecting virtue**, it **does not qualify as awe-inspiring virtue and power**. Yet this scripture’s **law both eliminates evil and eradicates offenses**, **strengthens the true and fulfills virtue**—its **divine efficacy and wondrous merits are immeasurable**, hence it is called **awe-inspiring virtue and power**.\n\nAs for its **mighty divine spell**, see the earlier explanation. It can **revive withered branches and leaves**, making **flowers and fruits flourish abundantly**. All **grasses, trees, rare flowers, uncommon vegetables, auspicious fungi, and sacred incense**—whatever **cannot thrive and grow naturally**—and all **dried, withered, or damaged plants**, this scripture **restores to life, sprouting branches and leaves**, **blossoms and fruits**, **flourishing and multiplying abundantly**.\n\nIt can **banish the most profound suffering and afflictions of all beings**. This scripture **dissolves all karma**, benefiting **living beings**; **extracts all sins**, benefiting **the dying**. It **removes demonic calamities**, **secures human happiness**. Through **countless ages of karmic retribution and desire**, or **lifelong vexation and torment**, the **heaviest suffering endured across generations**—this scripture **eradicates their very roots**.\n\nIt can **grant long life to those with short spans**. Among mortals, **seventy years is rare**. This scripture **preserves life and extends vitality**, enabling **those who die young or live briefly** to **calculate and prolong their years**, achieving **long life**.\n\nSome say, **\"Yanzi, the second Sage, lived only thirty years—this proves that Daoist virtue/power (德) brings no benefit. Why claim that this scripture extends life?\"** Yet **true longevity is not dying**. Yanzi, **suddenly enlightened**, **did not die**. The scripture speaks of **extending the life of those with short spans**, meaning it **allows beings to attain enlightenment and thus not die**.\n\nThis scripture’s **merits and virtues are beyond reckoning**, praise **cannot exhaust them**. Its **glory is endless**.\n\nAh, the loyalty and righteousness of Lord Ke—his virtue stands like bamboo groves after the axe;\nthe filial piety and brotherly love of the Tian clan—his descendants revive like chaste plants reborn.\n\nWhen the Sage rules above, even common households may be ennobled—life and death bring swift joy.\nTo attain the fullness of the Great Dao is to encompass all beings in virtue and power without distinction.\n\nLet those who study this scripture strive earnestly—its highest merit is self-attained.\n\n**The Chapter of Manifestations (续十九章):**\nIf one has not in past lives cultivated the Dao’s root,\nor sown fields of merit broadly,\neven the name of this scripture may go unheard—\nhow much less could one hope to see it?\n\nThe scripture’s virtue and power are boundless.\n\nIf one has not in past lives cultivated the Dao’s root—\nthe root is like the foundation.\nThe gentleman attends to the foundation,\nfor when the foundation stands, the Dao arises—\nthus it is called *Dao-ben* (道本).\nSome mistakenly call it *Dao-zhong* (道种)—this is incorrect.\n*Host* (宿) means *previously* or *in advance*;\n*plant* (植) means *establish*, *nurture*, or *sow*.\nThe Dao’s root is the gradual cultivation of the fundamental path.\n\nThe Dao scriptures say: *The Great Dao is nameless—*\nthrough precise cultivation, it is perfected.\nConfucius said: *Study the lesser to attain the greater.*\nThe Buddha scriptures say: *From hearing and reflection to meditation,*\nentering *samādhi* (三摩地).\nThe Three Teachings all emphasize learning—\nthis is the foundation for attaining the Dao.\n\nYet though enlightenment may come suddenly,\nit requires gradual practice—\nnot all can be accomplished in a single step.\n\nIf one has not in past lives or this life\nprepared through cultivation,\nor planted the Dao’s root and sown fields of merit broadly—\n*Fo-tian* (福田), where deeds bear fruit like cultivated fields,\nis thus named.\n\n**External practices** include:\nrefurbishing Daoist halls, Buddhist temples, hermitages, shrines, ancestral halls, pagodas, community altars,\nbuilding bridges, roads, and administering medicine to heal the sick—\nassisting the state, saving lives, casting talismans for relief,\npraying for blessings, ensuring progeny, benefiting all beings,\nexorcising evil, averting calamities, relieving suffering,\nand rescuing the poor.\n\n**Inner cultivation** encompasses:\ncompassion and mercy, joy in giving, endurance of insults,\nharmonizing brilliance, universal benefit without selfishness,\nand unshakable, perfect fulfillment.\n\n**Coarse practices** involve:\ndonating wealth, clothing, and food.\n**Secret practices** include:\nmeditating on the Dao, contemplating the True One,\nabstaining from desire to nourish the spirit,\naccumulating essence and refining qi.\n\nThe path to sainthood and transcendence varies endlessly—\ncountless fields of merit await cultivation.\n\nSowing the fields of this world, the seasons bring drought or flood,\nhuman affairs are uneven—sometimes the harvest fails.\nBut sowing the fields of merit, even a little yields results,\nand great efforts bring great rewards.\n\nThe hidden virtues are countless—\nunknown to others, unspeakable in full,\ntheir merit is boundless.\n\nIf one does not sow the fields of merit,\neven the name of this scripture may not be heard.\nWithout virtue or fortune, one does not hear its name.\nThe scripture says: *\"The True Law is rarely encountered\"*—\nthis is what it means.\n\nHow much more rare to actually see this scripture?\nTo see this true scripture is to open the Dao-eye.\nWithout virtue or fortune, how could one hear its name,\nlet alone see it?\n\nMortal fates differ—some receive blessings, others wisdom.\nThe wealthy may be foolish without virtue;\nthe poor may be sage-like without fortune.\nWhen virtue and fortune align, one gains rank, wealth, and

Twenty-Six: The Manifestation Section (Continued) – The Great Dao Body**\n\nThose who uphold this scripture are named *Great Dao Body*,\nfor they fear nothing in all their comings and goings.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture are not merely called *Compassionate Body*—\nthey are named *Great Dao Body*.\nThe Dao is formless, yet the human body has form.\nHuman nature encompasses the fullness of the Dao,\nobtaining the principles of Heaven and Earth,\nthe *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\nIf one speaks of *Dao Body*,\nevery person possesses the Dao,\nyet no person exhausts it.\nThus, the body given by parents is called *human body*.\nThe Four Great Elements are fleeting—\nit is called *illusionary body*.\nUntransformed by things—\nit is called *common body*.\nDrunk in life, dead in dreams—\nit is called *ignorant body*.\nBusy from dawn to dusk, sweetly hastening to old age and death—\nit is called *karmic body*.\nUncultivated and unlearned, bound in endless cycles—\nit is called *sinful body*.\nFragrant flowers fade swiftly, the willow’s branches are few—\nit is called *impermanent body*.\nMale and female differ in form, old and young in appearance—\nit is called *suffering body*.\nWhen the final hour arrives, not even kin can be spared—\nit is called *lonely body*.\nWind, rain, cold, and heat assail the flesh—\nit is called *suffering body*.\n\nThis is the state of mortals—\nnone possess the Dao.\n\nThose who truly uphold the scripture attain the Law and become real—\nthis is the *Dao Body*,\nnot the common body,\nnamed *Great Dao Body*.\nIn all their comings and goings,\nthey fear nothing.\n\n*Scare* is anxiety and worry,\n*Fear* is dread.\nOnly those who uphold the scripture are called *Great Dao Body*,\nmoving forth with ease, returning without burden;\nwhether moving or resting,\npure and detached from worldly ties,\nthey are ever serene—\nwhat anxiety, what dread?\nWherever they are,\nthey fear nothing.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe Confucian says:\n*\"Be cautious in what is unseen,\nfearful of what is unheard.\"*\nIs this not *fear*?\nYet joy, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, fear, and startle—\nthe Seven Emotions reside in all.\nIf one says, *\"In all comings and goings, they fear nothing,\"*\nit seems contrary to caution and dread.\nThis is not so.\nCaution and dread restrain desire,\npreserving the true Dao.\nThe Seven Emotions reveal the fullness of human nature—\nthey urge one to subdue passions and return to essence.\nIf fear arises from inner instability,\nstemming from external calamities,\nand one is gripped by dread,\nthis is not the true path.\nThus the Master said:\n*\"Examine oneself and find no guilt—\nwhat then to fear?\"*\nHow can there be anxiety or dread?\nIn all their comings and goings, they fear nothing,\nfor body and Dao are one—\nwherever they go, they are at ease.\nThe Confucian says:\n*\"Seeing the Great, the heart is tranquil.\"*\nThis aligns with their state.\nThose who uphold the scripture move without fear—\nthis is natural, not forced.\n\nForced constraint, then the *Mòzǐ*’s \"unmoved heart\" is ultimately not the Dao’s realization.\nNatural spontaneity, then the Master’s \"no doubt from the heart\" and Mencius’ \"unmoved heart\" all align with this scriptural truth.\nTruly, the two teachings’ doctrine of the heart proclaims:\n*\"Suchness, natural and unshaken—\nthe Dao of divine transformation is here.\"*\n\nIf one forcibly grasps and does not self-transform,\nholding fast yet failing to endure—\nthough no fear arises, it still does not accord with this scripture’s intent.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven of the *Yànyàn* Section (Continuation):**\nThose who uphold this scripture are called *liángyī shēn*—\nthe \"Body of the Skilled Physician,\" for they practice wondrous methods to bring ease to all.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture are not merely called *Dàdào shēn*—\nthey are called *liángyī shēn*.\nThe physician is fitting—\nmedicine and illness must align to remove afflictions.\n\nWorldly physicians examine forms and discern principles,\nhealing sickness, rescuing crises,\nusing drugs to dispel disease, benefiting life—\nthey earn renown for divine and skillful craft.\nYet true scripture-holders are not worldly physicians,\nnor common healers, nor purveyors of coastal prescriptions.\nTheir golden needles move in silent measure—\nthey are the *Body of the Skilled Physician*.\n\nThey practice wondrous methods well:\nhuman *qi* and temperament are mixed and varied—\nsome lose their balance at birth,\nsome bear visible ailments,\nsome bear invisible ailments,\nsome suffer bodily woes,\nsome suffer familial woes,\nsome suffer national woes,\nsome suffer age-long woes,\nsome suffer karmic woes across lifetimes.\nIllness and suffering cling, endless in their cycle—\nparents cannot instruct them,\nsages cannot transform them,\nlaws cannot restrain them,\nmedicine cannot cure them,\nsalvation has no method.\n\nYet those who uphold this scripture act without deceit,\nwithout forced intrusion—\ntheir wondrous applications are fitting and true.\nTheir methods are sound, their teachings apt—\nno bitter words, no harsh tones,\nno defiance of the heart,\nno burden to the body,\nno forcing of the impossible,\nno indulging in false compliance.\nThey practice wondrous methods to bring ease to all.\n\nThus, when the wondrous method is applied:\nThe deaf regain hearing;\nThen the blind see clearly;\nThen the mute speak;\n\n「Then the lame rise and walk upright;\nThen those long afflicted by chronic illness regain their vitality in an instant;\nThen gray hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow;\nThen the aged grow strong, the young grow mighty;\nThen women conceive, and birds and beasts likewise bear offspring—whether born or unborn, all come to fruition;\nThen the treasures of the earth are revealed, and gold and jade manifest in their forms;\nThen withered bones revive, and all become living, complete persons.\n\nIt dispels all calamities, liberates all adversities.\nMalevolent spirits and grudges of past lives never dare intrude or harm;\nThe nine ancestral ties and six kinsfolk—past, present, and future—\nare untroubled, free from entanglement, their bonds dissolved in the void.\n\nAbundance flourishes, the body grows light—\nnot merely lifting those burdened by grave illness,\nbut even preventing afflictions before they take form.\nTruly, without medicine yet bringing joy,\nit eternally preserves life to extend one’s years—\nnot a single remedy or technique,\nbut the Way’s own physician for all beings.\n\nThe Heavenly Physician is the best,\na compassionate father to all sentient beings;\nwondrous methods in virtuous practice\nbring ease to all who uphold them.\n\nThis scripture ascends to the **Great Dao of Reality** (*Zhēndào*), the **Marvelous Prescription for the Age** (*Shìshì qífāng*).\nEvery person inherently possesses it—\nyet those who stray remain unaware.\n\nThose who sincerely uphold this true scripture gain its rewards;\nit is fitting to benefit the world.\nWhy, in this degenerate age, do selfish thoughts arise?\nWhen one gains even a little,\nyet does not extend compassion to all beings?\nLike the fatness of Qin and the leanness of Yue,\nthey are unrelated—\nat first, they do not teach the world,\nbut ultimately, they indulge their own desires.\nBriefly

refer to the **Five Sacred Mountains and ten thousand spirits** (*wǔ yuè wàn shén*).\nThe Three Realms include the **Five Sacred Mountains** (*sān jiè zhōng yǒu wǔ yuè*), hence the **Five Elders** (*wǔ lǎo*).\nIn the scripture, the **Five Elders** (*wǔ lǎo*) **begin the questioning** (*qǐ wèn*), so when the scripture is opened,\nthe **Five Elders** (*wǔ lǎo*) **oversee the reception** (*sī

**follow the prescribed methods** (*yīng dāng yī kē*) and **devoutly practice in silent mindfulness** (*míng xīn fèng xíng*).\nNot only must one **devoutly recite** (*qián sòng*) this scripture and **gain the spirits’ protection** (*dé zhū shén hù*),\nbut also, when **closing their eyes in still meditation** (*bì mù jìng zuò*),\nthey may **subdue the Five Aggregates’ harm** (*sǐng xiǎng wǔ yùn zhī hài*), with **form** (*sè*) being the foremost.\nThe **disorder of form** (*sè zhī luàn xīn*) is **realized through the eyes** (*mù shí zhī*).\nTo **uphold the true scripture** (*fèng chí zhēn jīng*), one’s **body and mind must be harmonious** (*shēn xīn yí*).\nTo **close the eyes and attain stillness** (*bì mù yǐ jìng*), the **heart naturally enters Great Tranquility** (*xīn zì dà dìng*).\nYet the **Dao’s profound subtlety** (*dào zhī xuán wēi*) cannot be **grasped without contemplation** (*fēi sī bù rù*).\n**Random thoughts** (*wàng sī*) only **disturb the True** (*yòu suǒ luàn zhēn*).\nTo **close the eyes and sit in still meditation** (*bì mù jìng zuò*), not **seeing what is desirable** (*bù jiàn kě yú*),\nso that the **heart does not stray** (*xīn bù luàn*), to **remain silent and ponder** (*mò hē sī suǒ*),\n**delving into the profound mysteries** (*mì rù shēn jī*—*dào zhī dà yào yě*).\nNow, for those who **sit in still meditation with closed eyes** (*jìng zuò zhě*), it is said that **the eyelids should be half-lowered** (*liǎng mù bàn chuí lián*), not fully closed,\nlest they engage in **ghostly schemes and occult practices** (*wèi zuò guǐ kuàng huó jì*—*bù zhī yīn qù zá niàn, shì yuē guǐ kuàng*).\nIf the **heart is pure** (*xīn qīng jìng*), what harm is there in **closing the eyes** (*bì mù*)?\nThe **common folk’s hearts are not resolute** (*shí rén xīn bù jué liè*), so they **hesitate when closing their eyes** (*bì mù yí shēng*).\nThus, they **half-open their eyes** (*bàn kāi yǎn*), lest they **fall into slumber or doubt** (*bù zhuó shuì mó yí shēng*).\nIf one **forgets both good and evil** (*shàn è liǎng wàng*), **holds neither being nor non-being** (*wú wú yě wú*), the **True Dao enters naturally** (*zhēn dào zì rù*).\nWhat hindrance is there in **closing the eyes** (*bì mù*)?\nThe **half-lowered eyelids** (*chuí lián zhī lùn*) are merely a **precaution of the Mysterious Masters** (*xuán shī fáng wú zhì rén mó huò*).\nMoreover, the **meaning of half-lowered eyelids** (*chuí lián zhī yì*) is to **not observe outwardly** (*bì mù bù guān*),\nwhile **innerly possessing true illumination** (*nèi yǒu zhēn zhào*).\nThe **heart’s law is ever-awake** (*xīn fǎ xīng xīng*), **radiant and unobscured** (*guāng míng bù mèi*).\nLike **lowering the curtain to attend to governance** (*rú chuí lián tīng zhèng*), though one does not **look upon the matters** (*bù guān guān kàn*),\nthose who **should respond** (*dāng yìng zhě*) are **without fail known** (*wú bù zhī qí*).\nThis is the **mechanism of Dao cultivation** (*gū jiā*), hence its inclusion in the discussion of the scripture.\n\nThe **cultivation of visualization** (*cún xiǎng*) is the scripture itself. Yet this visualization is not the summoning of visions or effects as in the *Zhāoshè Jīng* (Scripture of Summoning and Gathering). When practicing this method, one should revere the Jade Emperor as if seeing him in person, pondering the Dao and seeking the True—never lightly or carelessly.\n\nMere recitation of the scripture with a distracted mind is insufficient. One must **quietly preserve this heart**, delving deeply into its profound truths. When embodied in body and mind, the saying *\"visualization is the scripture\"* holds true—unaware, one finds oneself immersed in the **three-colored qi-clouds** (*sān sè yún qì*). These clouds arise from the **steaming of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nWhen the mind is deeply settled in the scripture, it merges with the **Heavenly Heart** (*tiān xīn*), and with each sincere thought, the **auspicious clouds** (*qìng yún*) emerge—unaware, one is enveloped in the **three-colored qi-clouds of green, yellow, and white**. When the mind and body are still and upright, the **Dragon and Tiger coil and spiral** (*lóng hǔ pán xuán*), giving rise to these three-colored clouds.\n\nIf one attains True Perfection, then **five-colored clouds** (*wǔ sè yún*) gather, and the **nine radiant glories** (*jiǔ xiá guāng*) spread forth—this is yet another state.\n\nSuddenly (*rú*), in the blink of an eye (*shǎo qīng shí*), one’s body shines **radiantly resplendent** (*guāng míng hè yì*), ascending to the **Celestial Palace** (*tiān gōng*), where the **multitudes of True Ones** descend to welcome.\n\n**Suddenly**, in a short while, one’s body **glows brilliantly** (*shēn guāng huàn fā*), **magnificent and luminous** (*shèng yào bǐng yì*). As previously explained.\n\nWhen the heart has a request, when the mind seeks entry into the **Celestial Palace**, all **supreme elixirs and wondrous treasures** (*yuánshǐ yùdì xiāndān miàobǎo*) are **offered in response**—whatever is desired is naturally obtained.\n\nOne must not merely **seek treasures**; the treasures are **offered to oneself**. One should **follow the prescribed methods** (*yī kē*), as previously explained.\n\nThe scripture is the **true nature of human essence** (*rén xìng zhēn*). Silent enlightenment and steadfast practice suffice.\n\nSpeaking of visualization, it seems to fall under the **second meaning** (*dì èr yì*). The Confucian classics say:\n*\"Faintly perceived, yet unseen—like a form without substance, yet clearly visible. It is as if one stands upon it.\"*\n\nIs this not also the **second meaning**?\n\nAlas, **enlightened sages are few**, while **mediocre minds prevail**. If one does not **grasp visualization**, how can one seek the **unheard teachings** (*bù wén zhī shì*) and thus **harmonize with Heaven and humanity**, transcend the mundane, and enter the sacred?\n\nLet scholars ponder this.\n\n---\n**Continuation of the *Yìngyàn Pǐn* (Verification Chapter), Thirty-Second Section**\n\nThis scripture is the path by which **three-world Golden Immortals** (*sān shì jīn xiān*) and **ten-direction Great Saints** (*shí fāng dà shèng*) attain the **supreme wondrous Dao**. The **Jade Emperor** of this scripture is the **teacher of all heavens** and the **king of all saints**.\n\nThis scripture is not merely for those who recite it with devotion—even **three-world Golden Immortals**, whether of the past, present, or future worlds, must follow its methods to attain the **supreme wondrous Dao**.\n\n**Golden Immortals** (*jīn xiān*) are those whose **Golden Elixirs do not decay** (*jīn dān bù huǐ*), the **true Daoists of the Great Mysterious** (*tài xuán zhēn xiān*). The **ten-direction Great Saints**—those of the **four cardinal, four diagonal, and upper-lower directions** (*sì zhèng fāng, sì yú fāng, shàng xià fāng*)—the **ten-direction numinous treasures and divine spirits** (*shí fāng língbǎo zūnshén*), the **Great Saints of Ultimate Truth and Boundless Extremes** (*zhì zhēn wújí dà shèng*)—all attain the **supreme wondrous Dao** by following its methods, as previously explained.\n\nProgress in cultivation varies, and attainments differ. Those whose **Dao-verification stages** (*zhèngdào jiē pǐn*) have not yet been reached do not yet possess the **supreme**.\n\nWhether **gods, humans, earthly, or ghostly immortals**; whether **desire-realm, form-realm, or formless heavenly deities**; whether **Bodhisattvas, Śrāvakas, Arhats, or Buddhist vehicles**; whether **transformed, great, beautiful, faithful, virtuous persons, or Confucian sages**—none of these are the **ultimate**.\n\nOnly **Celestial Immortals** (*tiān xiān*), **Wen Buddhas** (*wén fó*), and **unknowable Saints** (*bù zhī shèng*)—where **gods and Confucians** are named the **highest**—do the Golden Immortals and Great Saints, by **faithfully following this scripture**, merge with the **Imperial True Ones** (*dì zhēn*), thus attaining the **highest Immortal**, transcending and verifying the **supreme, ultimate, and wondrous Dao**, beyond the fruits of **heavenly blessings and virtues**.\n\nThis is the **Jade Emperor**. *Zhī* means *\"this.\"* He is the **teacher of all heavens**—the **thirty-three heavens**, the **thirty-six heavens**, the **twelve thousand heavens**, the **three thousand great worlds**, and **all heavens**—who **transform and give rise to the multitudes of True Ones** through the *Huáng Jīng* (Imperial Scripture).\n\nHe is the **king of all saints**—whether **immortals, Confucian sages, Buddhas, heavenly beings, or gods**—all **yield their virtues**, **surrender their merits**, and **acknowledge their supremacy**, revering him through the ages.\n\nAlas, if a person’s **Heavenly Sovereign** (*tiān jūn*) remains **serene and composed**, then the Dao may be attained. If one does not **cultivate the mind to enlightenment**, merging with Heaven in virtue, and **venerating the Supreme in emptiness**, one has **fallen short**. Be warned and reflect.\n\n---\n**Continuation of the *Yìngyàn Pǐn*, Thirty-Third Section**\n\nThus, when an **ordinary person** (*fán fú*) encounters this scripture and **devotes themselves with single-minded devotion**, even the **Five Emperors** (*wǔ dì*) will **assist and shelter**, summoning **multitudes of immortals**, commanding **divine officials**, directing **yin-yang forces**, earning the **respect of ten thousand spirits**, subduing **myriad gods**, keeping **a hundred evils at bay**, and binding **all demons** in form.\n\nAfter death, one will **enter the Southern Palace for refinement**, ascending the **Upper Clarity** (*shàng qīng*) with **free and easy steps**, dwelling in **adaptability and eternal Dao**.\n\nIt is not only **Golden Immortals and Great Sages** who verify the Dao through this scripture.\n\nThus, when an **ordinary person** (*shìjiān fán fú*) encounters this scripture through **karmic opportunity**, and **devotes themselves with precision and sincerity**, even the **Five Elder Emperors** (*wǔ lǎo dìshì*—not the Five Peaks) will **aid their cultivation** and **supplement their deficiencies**. They will **summon immortals** and **command divine officials**—**issuing orders to make them act**, as immortals respond to command, and **controlling them to serve**, as divine officials obey.\n\nThe scripture states:\n*\"Those who cultivate the Dao with devotion can even command ghosts and subdue gods.\"*\n\nEven an ordinary person, through **single-minded devotion to the scripture**, wielding the **power of Dao-law**, can **summon immortals and command gods**, directing **yin-yang forces**. Only through **precision and unity** can one **govern transformation** and **guide yin-yang**.\n\nThe **ten thousand spirits** will **reverently bow in awe**, and the **myriad gods** will **submit in fear and servitude**—without need for ritual. The **a hundred evils** will **avoid the path**, and the **multitudes of demons** will **restrain their forms**, daring not to reveal themselves.\n\nAfter death, one’s spirit perceives what was unseen before.\n\nOne is then admitted to the **Southern Palace** for **refinement**—the **Southern Palace**, the Vermilion Refinement Bureau, where souls are measured and spirits are tempered. Having undergone **refinement**, one ascends to the **Upper Purity** realm, taking **divine strides** to reach the **Upper Purity** heavens—this is not the true Upper Purity domain, but merely the expression of ascending to heaven.\n\nFreed to wander at will, one avoids the **Six Realms of Torment**, escapes the consequences of **karma**, and is bound by no constraints—moving effortlessly and at ease.\n\nWith the Dao, one endures eternally. Though initially not yet perfect, if one devotes oneself **single-mindedly** to the scripture, aligning one’s heart with the Dao, free from obstruction and entanglement, the spirit and soul become pure and undefiled, never again to perish or fall—thus enduring with the Dao.\n\nThis is what the **Daoist classics** mean by *\"dying yet not perishing\"* and what the **Buddhist scriptures** mean by *\"enlightenment brings instant release.\"*\n\nEven the most humble practitioner, through **single-minded devotion** to the scripture, achieves such results—then it is known how profound the **power of utmost sincerity** is.\n\nThough of low understanding, one can still fully attain the Dao. Let the reader strive accordingly.\n\n**Chapter 34: Manifestations of Response**\nMoreover, when common folk in the world hear this scripture and their hearts yearn in reverence, they can, within their households, choose a pure and serene place, draw an image of the **Imperial Sage**, and with **earnest devotion**, offer incense morning and night—abundant **sacred flowers, lamps, and fruits**, honoring and nourishing the sacred form, chanting the **holy name**, and bowing in worship while reciting the scripture. Such a person shall attain **thirty kinds of supreme, wondrous virtues**:\n\n1. The **ten thousand immortals** shall hold them in high esteem,\n2. The **departed ancestors** shall be reborn in heaven,\n3. Past **sufferings and calamities** shall be resolved and released,\n4. All paths they tread shall be **smooth and open**.\n\n「The remaining twenty kinds of supreme, wondrous virtues**:\n\n5. They shall be free from theft and banditry,\n6. All their desires shall be fulfilled,\n7. They shall be delivered from water and fire calamities,\n8. All misfortunes and adversities shall be subtly dispelled,\n9. Their nightly dreams shall be auspicious and fortunate,\n10. Illnesses and diseases shall not afflict them,\n11. Their wisdom and intelligence shall be acute and clear,\n12. All who see them shall rejoice,\n13. Their clothing and food shall be abundant and flourishing,\n14. Their descendants shall be honored and noble—*not merely wealthy and opulent, but virtuous and refined, free from ignoble or untimely misfortune*,\n15. Their six kinsfolk shall take joy in them,\n16. Their household and lineage shall dwell in harmony,\n17. They shall be freed from the three kinds of evil retribution,\n18. They shall be transformed from female to male,\n19. Their appearance and bearing shall be dignified and awe-inspiring,\n20. They shall become great ministers of the realm,\n21. They shall be born as the sons of emperors,\n22. Ghosts and spirits shall hold them in reverence and awe,\n23. They shall attain the **Dharma of Retention**—*all past karma shall be exhausted, and their life-force shall flow unimpeded*,\n24. All gods shall protect and honor those who uphold this scripture and revere the **Imperial Sage**,\n25. Their nine lineages shall be sheltered—*the nine lineages being: the paternal great-grandfather, paternal grandfather, paternal ancestor, father, oneself, son, grandson, great-grandson, and remote descendant; or alternatively, the three generations of the father, the three generations of the mother, and the three generations of the wife*,\n26. They shall live long in this world,\n27. All sentient beings in the world shall rely upon their virtuous deeds,\n28. The **Mara-kings** shall commend and welcome them,\n29. They shall ascend beyond the realms of desire, form, and formlessness,\n30. They shall ascend in broad daylight—*though the transformations of the immortals vary, this does not necessarily mean ascending in the flesh during daylight; rather, their essence harmonizes with the **Great Void** and their spirit roams the **Celestial Capital** of the Imperial Sage*.\n\nTo uphold this scripture with reverence and honor the **Imperial Sage**, though these virtues may be attained, one must first utterly abandon all secret lusts, seek no verification of their efficacy, nor cease their practice. With their heart aligned with the **Heavenly Dao**, only then shall they bear fruit—even if no fruit is borne, it shall not diminish their merit in doing good.\n\nIf one seeks only these effects, they are not truly transmitting the **Imperial Sage’s scripture**. May the observant heed this warning.\n\n**Continuation of Chapter 35: Manifestations of Response**\nAt that time, the **Celestial Sage** further instructed the **Four Assemblies**, saying:\n\n“The virtues of this scripture are such that it can shatter the **Yin Mountains** and the **Iron Encircled Mountains**, drain the waters of the **Sea of Suffering**, dispel the **Great Underworld Prison**, extract all beings from sin and torment, subdue violent and malevolent **Mara-demons**, and safeguard all lands.\n\nIt can extinguish all malevolent ghosts, banish all evil spirits and dark realms, and eliminate all grave illnesses. It can dissolve all malevolent poisons, sever ties with all wicked people—*either by preventing encounter or causing such persons to flee upon seeing them*—and tame all venomous beasts. Moreover, those who practice **Daoist refinement** shall transmute their **Yin-qi** into poisonous dragons, fierce beasts, and great serpents, each numbering in the hundreds of billions, all protecting this **true scripture** and ensuring their own subjugation, forever shielding it.\n\nThe remaining virtues are too numerous to recount exhaustively.\n\nTo uphold this scripture and honor the **Imperial Sage** yields thirty kinds of virtue.\n\nAt that time, the **Celestial Sage** further instructed the **Four Assemblies**, saying:\n\n“The virtues of this scripture are such that it can shatter the **Yin Mountains** and the **Iron Encircled Mountains**, purifying all lingering dust.\n\nIt can drain the **Sea of Suffering**, turning heads toward the shore and leaving its waves dry. It can dispel the **Great Underworld Prison**, silencing all false attachments. It can extract beings from all sin and torment, severing the roots of karma and preventing any future retribution. It can subdue violent and malevolent **Mara-demons**, restraining their arrogance and perverse delusions. It can safeguard all lands, ensuring prosperity and peace, wealth for the realm, and security for its people.\n\nIt can extinguish all malevolent ghosts, banishing all malevolent and dark spirits, and severing ties with dark, evil destinies. It can eliminate all grave illnesses, cleansing all afflictions. It can dissolve all malevolent poisons, removing all worldly malevolence and the **great true poison** of the body. It can sever ties with all wicked people—*either by preventing encounter or causing such persons to flee upon seeing them*—and tame all venomous beasts.\n\nMoreover, those who practice **Daoist refinement** shall transmute their **Yin-qi** into poisonous dragons, fierce beasts, and great serpents, numbering in the hundreds of billions, all protecting this **true scripture** and ensuring their own subjugation, forever shielding it.»\n\nIt can crush all heretical Dao/Way, shatter all worldly heresies, and destroy one’s own deluded, false attachments.\n\nAll the celestial beings—all the heavens and their realms—\nshall naturally hold this scripture in reverence, spontaneously honoring it.\n\nAs for its remaining virtues, they are beyond exhaustive description—refer to what has been said before.\n\nThis scripture’s virtues dissolve what is difficult to dispel and remove what is difficult to eradicate. It transforms all things without exception, benefiting all without fail. It is the **great expedient means**, the **supreme Dharma category**.\n\nThough it is the subtle speech of the most exalted sages, it is the very essence of what can be accomplished.\n\nStrive earnestly, and the merit shall naturally manifest.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Manifestation of Verification (Continuation)**\n\nAt that time, the gathered Daoist assembly, the Golden Immortal Bodhisattvas, and the retinues of the True Saints, upon hearing this, rejoiced and leapt in exultation. They bowed in reverence and composed a hymn:\n\n*\"Great is the Ultimate Dao/Way,\nWithout origin, the Most High True One.\nIt ascends to elevate all heavens,\nDescends to rescue the lost souls.\nIt has no teacher or ancestor—\nThe Dao/Way itself is the body.\nIn the Dan Platform and Purple Mansion,\nAt the Golden Gate and Jade Capital,\nThis wondrous law is hidden,\nBestowing universal blessings upon all living beings.\nIt eradicates my ten thousand sins,\nAnd extends my boundless years.\nTen thousand spirits pay homage,\nWhile the demon kings guard and welcome.\nIts virtues flourish boundlessly,\nRecorded in the Yellow Register of names,\nVast across countless eons,\nEnsuring my eternal existence.\"*\n\nThen the assembled Daoist congregation, having finished their hymn, bowed and took refuge. They paid respects and withdrew.\n\nAt that time, the Daoist assembly—\n*The Daoist assembly, where the Dao/Way is expounded*—\nthe Golden Immortal Bodhisattvas and the retinues of the True Saints, upon hearing this, having finished the scripture, rejoiced and leapt in exultation, their joy overflowing like drums and dances.

      "translated_text": "**On the Dao**\nComposed by **Lǎorén Yānxiān** (老人臞仙), the aged sage of the Southern Pole.\n\n---\n\nYānxiān says: When examining the origins of the Daoist teaching, in the primal chaos when distinctions first emerged, human affairs were yet incomplete. The Celestial Mandate (天命) bestowed upon our Daoist Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor (轩辕黄帝), to inherit the **Nine Sovereigns’** (九皇) dispensation, wield the **Six Dragons** (六龙) to govern Heaven, and establish the Celestial Pole (极) in place of Heaven, thus ordering the **Three Talents** (三才). At that time, the heavens and earth were still indistinct, lacking script, so he used knotted cords (结绳) to administer affairs; lacking dwellings, he lived in nests and caves (巢居以穴处); lacking garments, he bound grass to cover his body (结草以蔽体); lacking vessels, he drank from his cupped hands (汗尊而杯饮). Our Daoist Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor, first devised script, garments, palaces, and vessels, thereby completing human affairs. Today, among the **Nine Schools** (九流) and within the **Three Teachings** (三教), the script used, the garments worn, the dwellings inhabited, and the vessels employed are all originally instituted by the Yellow Emperor. Thus, these all stem from the Daoist teaching of the Yellow Emperor.\n\nMoreover, the **Laozi** (老子) proclaimed: *\"To give birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things, there must be that which gives birth. I do not know its name; I forcefully name it the Dao, and forcefully call it Great, hence the Great Dao, and its teaching is Daoism.\"* Only then did the term *Dao* (道) appear in the world. Therefore, those who speak of *practicing the Dao* or *studying the Dao* are all appropriating the words of the **Laozi**, using *Dao* as their name. Are they not the disciples of the **Laozi**?\n\nAgain, when the **Laozi** spoke of *\"the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious, the Gate of All Marvels\"* (玄之又玄，为众妙门), the two characters *Mysterious* (玄) were also taken as names and applied to scriptures. Thus, these are all uses of the **Laozi’s** words.\n\nFurther, the *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》) text states: *\"There is the Great Awakening (大觉), and only then does one know the Sage.\"* The term *Great Awakening* (大觉) was a name established by **Zhuangzi**; the **Emperor Huizong** (徽宗) adopted it and conferred the title *Golden Sage* (金仙) upon it. The scriptures all employ this term—these are all derived from the Daoist texts and the teachings of the Yellow Emperor, **Laozi**, and **Zhuangzi**.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Imperial Scripture’s Continuation and Annotation**\nThe character *Dao* (道) is revered equally by the **Three Teachings** (三教). Yet, reckless and deluded sects falsely label the Dao as the **Two Vehicles** (二乘), which is a profound misunderstanding. The **Jade Emperor** (玉帝) is likewise venerated by the **Three Teachings** (三教). Blind followers sometimes call him the *Lord of Heaven* (天主), claiming he is not sufficiently honored—this fails to grasp the **Jade Emperor’s** true essence and origins.\n\nThe Emperor’s virtue is boundless; his merit, unspoiled. His station is most exalted, his name most triumphant, governing all ten thousand worlds, encompassing the **Three Teachings**. He rules over the **Three Thousand Great Thousands** (三千大千), transcending kalpas with ease. The Confucianists call him the *Supreme Lord* (上帝), the Buddhists name him *Flame-Light* (燃灯), and the Daoists honor him as the *Mysterious Master* (玄主). His grandeur surpasses all others.\n\nBeholding this scripture, one recognizes the Emperor’s wondrous deeds, dispelling doubts and perplexities of ages past and present. Alas, those who fail to understand it, who have not yet grasped its meaning, still indulge in false speculation, unable to awaken, and their sins deepen evermore. Do they not realize that human life originates from the Dao, is governed by the Emperor, and finds clarity in the Sage’s instructions?\n\nIf one scorns the Emperor, belittles Heaven, defames the scriptures, or fails to comprehend the Great Dao, it is as though one turns away from one’s roots and forgets one’s kin—unaware of the fundamental source of life and creation. Your servant, **Lǚ Wēi** (吕嵓), has long lamented this, and thus composes this preface at the head of the scripture’s annotations as a warning.\n\n---\n\n**Second Preface to the Imperial Scripture’s Continuation and Annotation**\nThe existence of Daoist scriptures is like the presence of the sun and moon in Heaven, or the statutes of a state. To behold the sun and moon yet turn one’s face to the wall is to avoid folly; to follow the laws of the ancient kings is to commit no errors. Then, to revere the true scriptures is surely the standard for entering the Dao.\n\nMoreover, this scripture was transmitted by **Yuánshǐ** (元始), and the **Jade Emperor** and all the gods proclaimed it. It is the highest grade among the **Three Teachings**, the secret speech of the **Great Sage** (大圣), worthy of reverence in every place and kalpa.\n\nYet, the Dao that transcends speech is already embodied in this scripture—why need further annotations? Still, the scriptures are written in words, and only those who have already attained the Dao can truly perceive them. For those who have not yet entered the gate, these annotations are indeed a profound aid. Without a raft, how does one cross the river? Alas, to seek the Dao apart from the scriptures is wrong; to cling to the scriptures as the Dao itself is also wrong.",

      "translated_text": "**Examination of the Dao’s Origins**\n\nThe Dao is originally formless and nameless—who could probe its source, whence could it be examined? From the Primordial Beginning, the Great Void bore the Mystic Existence, and the Dao’s hidden splendor emerged, its name thereby established. The One True Principle encompasses the Three, and the Three Teachings stand forth. Being and non-being, beginning and end, are not beyond the Five Phases. Eon follows eon in generation, sage follows sage in transmission—all are the Dao. Even if one transcends the Three Realms and lies beyond the Five Phases, one cannot escape being a practitioner of the Dao. Thus, the Dao’s manifestation and the name of the Daoist school originate here. Therefore, we first trace the source of the Scripture.\n\n**Source of the Scripture**\nScriptures bear the Dao, guiding the world with compassionate passage. All scriptures are the sacred utterances of enlightened sages, containing nothing but supreme truth. Yet this Scripture originates from the Primordial Beginning, its transformation rooted in the Jade Emperor. The Primordial Beginning is the first of the Three Teachings, the Jade Emperor the sovereign of all laws. This Scripture reaches the utmost profundity and subtlety, surpassing the Three Teachings; it is also the king of all scriptures, enduring through endless calamities. Its transmission begins from the beginningless, concealed in the Mystic Heaven, hidden within the Jade Peak. Its characters are not of ordinary kind—each spans a yard in breadth, their light piercing infinitely. The Celestial True Person, in response to the times, inscribed and passed it down to the world. Thus, the Scripture’s proclamation was made.\n\nTherefore, we continue tracing the Dao’s source.\n\n**The Jade Emperor: Supreme Sage, Original Master, and Lineage**\nThe Master, to guide the world, dispels delusion and extracts beings from suffering, transmitting the Dao and bestowing scriptures, opening the path for future generations. The Great Dao Master unifies the Three Teachings, encompasses all laws, dwelling in the Heaven of Heavens, as the Sage among sages—beginningless and endless, its origin unfathomable, prior to all phenomena. Yet the Dao’s subtlety divides into the True: it manifests in the radiant, pure, and blissful realm of the past eon.\n\nMortals observe the Yang Dao of Heaven’s brilliance—Yang governs bestowal, its mechanism ever active. The Emperor is thus revered as the **Zhang Emperor**. Misguided followers fail to grasp this truth, falsely claiming that the present **Zhang clan of Xingtai, Hebei (formerly True Definition Prefecture, Row Tang County)**, descends from the Jade Emperor. How could they confuse the **Zhang clan of Row Tang**, descendants of **Zhang Guo** and heirs of the **Zhang Immortal**, with such a claim?\n\nThis is merely an examination of lineage and clan.",

      "translated_text": "If one speaks of lineage, the Jade Emperor is the primordial emanation of the Great Dao, the ancient ancestor of the cosmic cataclysm—how could he be bound by birth, death, or name? The Emperor’s sacred consort, sacred children, and attendants are all manifestations of the Light-Strong Prince’s celestial retinue in past eons. When the Emperor ascends, his retinue attains the Way entirely. In truth, the Emperor and his retinue are not of mortal female form—they are the purest essence of Heaven. To guide all beings, they manifest in female form, as the scriptures have already stated. Even the Buddha attained enlightenment with his wife and children achieving sainthood.\n\nTo call the Jade Emperor the **Dao Ancestor**, across countless eons, all beings and classes are the generative intent of Heaven and Earth, branches of the Dao’s vital pulse. Who among them is not part of the Jade Emperor’s retinue and lineage? When the retinue of the Great Luo Palace attains the Way, they become celestial and saintly bodies. As with Manjusri presiding over the Immaculate World, or the Dragon Princess attaining the Way and transforming into male form—this is the same principle.\n\nYet today’s monks, Daoists, and common folk fail to grasp this truth, falsely believing the Jade Emperor has a retinue, undergoes rebirth, and is bound to the Two Vehicle fruits. How could they know that the celestial realms are countless, while the Three Pure Ones’ realm and the Great Luo Heaven are boundless? The celestial emperors undergo rebirth, but the Jade Emperor does not. For the Jade Emperor is the Dao Body—Dao is endless, how could the Jade Emperor be finite?\n\nTruly, the Jade Emperor is the supreme teacher of all Buddhas of the One Vehicle, the sovereign of all heavens, and his retinue is the marvel of Dao transformation. Such is the essence of the mystical lineage.\n\nScholars must not speak recklessly—examine this carefully.\n\n**On the Merit of Engraving Scriptures:**\nIn ancient times, there were no paper or brushes; records were inscribed on bamboo and wood. When **Mong Tian** and **Cai Lun** invented paper and ink, the merit of preserving scriptures doubled. Later, high sages carved wooden blocks for printing, multiplying the merit yet again.\n\nYet ignorant followers of false sects do not know that Mong Tian and Cai Lun received blessings from the **Tusita Heaven**, and that these two were later punished in the underworld for their sins. Their journey through the netherworld was guided by the **Great Sage of the Great Elixir Heaven** and **Kshitigarbha Bodhisattva**, who entered the underworld with scriptures to transform and liberate those guilty of heresy. How could these two suffer in hell? Their merit was vast—they were of the highest rank in engraving and propagating the teachings.\n\n**On the Merit of Reciting, Chanting, and Teaching Scriptures:**\nRecitation and exposition must be done with utmost sincerity, free from attachment, greed, or delusion. The merit will then match the scriptures’ words. Printing and distributing scriptures bring even greater merit, as they spread the Dharma widely. To treat scriptures lightly, defame them, or damage them is a grave offense. Be warned—do not betray the teachings of the sages.\n\n**On the Similarities and Differences of the Jade Emperor’s Sacred Titles:**\nThe Jade Emperor’s sacred titles date from before the cosmic cataclysm, were further honored in the Middle Ages, and are now praised anew. Rulers who cherish the Dao, moved by the **Mysterious Grace**, honor them according to their own revelations and devotions. As circumstances align and deeds are accomplished, their fame spreads, and all revere the divine titles, establishing their names.\n\nThe Jade Emperor has four forms:\n1. The **Taiwei Jade Emperor**, named after the star **Taiwei** in the **Taiwei Enclosure** during the Han dynasty under Emperor Wu;\n2. The **Brahman Heaven Jade Emperor**, named after the **Celestial Market Enclosure** during Emperor Xuan’s reign;\n3. The **Flame Flower Shao Wei Jade Emperor**, named after the **Primordial Fixed Position** during Emperor Ai’s reign;\n4. The **Zixu Jade Emperor**, named after the **Post-Heaven Stem** during Emperor Guangwu’s reign.\n\nNone of these are the true Jade Emperor. The true Jade Emperor bears the title:\n**Emperor of the Golden Gate of the Highest Sovereign of the Natural and Mysterious Perfection, the Primal and Perfect, the Jade Sovereign Emperor, also called the Highest Supreme Jade Emperor of the Mysterious Vault.**\n\nThis Emperor governs all heavens, never decaying or perishing. The world does not fully understand, mistakenly equating him with **Shakra (Indra)**. Yet the Jade Emperor’s titles are distinct. The four Jade Emperors all fall under the governance of the **Highest Supreme Jade Emperor**. Those who speak of the Four Emperors and the Heavenly Sovereign as equals are also mistaken. Those who understand the heavens will clarify this.\n\n**On the Jade Emperor’s Sovereignty Over the Extremes:**\n**Ge Xianhui** said: The heavens of the world, as perceived, are the same. Confucianism speaks of **One Heaven and Earth, One Emperor**. Daoism speaks of **thirty billion worlds**, each with thirty-six heavens, each heaven ruled by an emperor, all under the governance of the **Highest Supreme Jade Emperor**. Buddhism speaks of **three thousand great thousand-world systems**, each with thirty-two heavens, each ruled by a Jade Emperor.\n\nThough the three teachings seem divergent, those who speak of **One Heaven** refer to the **Great Void** beyond, calling it unfathomable, and speak of **thirty billion worlds**—beyond which lies the **Inconceivable**. Those who speak of **three thousand great thousand-world systems** say that beyond them lies the **Limitless**. Thus, Confucianism follows the **Imperial Norm**, saying, *\"The sage approximates Heaven.\"* Heaven’s body is boundless, and this principle holds true at the **Great Convergence of the Cosmic Cycle**.\n\nDaoism speaks of the **Highest Supreme Void**, the True Emperor who never decays; Buddhism speaks of **Suchness**, self-liberated and never regressing. Both affirm that the Jade Emperor never perishes. Thus, speaking of **One Heaven** is not an omission—it is a general name encompassing all, harmonizing with Dao and Buddhism. Speaking of **thirty billion worlds** or **three thousand great thousand-world systems** is not false—it is a division by number, aligning with Confucianism.\n\nAs for Buddhism’s claim that each world has its own Jade Emperor, each realm has its own **Ultimate**, Daoism asserts that all worlds share **this Jade Emperor**, all realms share **the One Beyond Extremes**.

      "translated_text": "「Now within the chaotic scriptures of Chan Buddhism, there is a mistaken claim that the Jade Emperor resides atop **Mount Sumeru (Must Prāṇidhāna)**, which is actually the realm of the **Four Heavenly Kings of the Day and Moon (Sūryaprabhāraja, Candraprabhāraja, and the four Dikpāla)**—a place where destruction may occur, save for the **Inner Court of Maitreya (Maitreya’s Inner Sanctuary)** as the **Non-Regressing Realm**.\n\nThey also speak of **Mileo Enclosure (Mīlùo Yuán)**, **Mileo Garden (Mīlùo Yuán)**, or **Mileo’s Pure True Realm (Mīlùo Xuánzhēn Jìng)**—these three names refer to the **Supreme Primordial Lord (Wúshàng Yuánjūn)** of Daoist scriptures, who manifests as the Jade Emperor in the **Non-Regressing Realm of Mileo’s Pure True Realm (Mīlùo Xuánzhēn Jìng)**. The **Four Heavenly Kings of the Day and Moon**, however, are the abode of the **Lesser Heavenly Emperor (Tàiwēi Yùdì)**, not the **Great Heavenly Emperor (Dàtiānzūn)**, the exalted Jade Emperor. Hence, Daoist scriptures say:\n\n*\"At the peak of **Mount Xuangu (Xuángǔ Shān)**, there is an **Imperial Sovereign (Dìjūn)**. One must pay homage to the **Jade Sovereign, Great Heavenly Emperor (Yùhuáng Dàtiānzūn)**.\"*\n\n**Mount Xuangu (Xuángǔ Shān)** is the Chan Buddhist **Mount Sumeru (Must Prāṇidhāna)**, the master of the **Day and Moon Heavenly Realm (Rìyuè Tiān)**, and the deity governing this realm—akin to the **Prefect of the Imperial Capital (Jīngzào Yìn)** of ancient times. Thus, when the **Buddha (Rúshì)** preaches the **Dharma (Fǎ)**, and the Emperor of the **Heavenly Realm (Tiānshì)** spreads his canopy—this is the **state examination (Zhuàngyuán Jìdì)** where a scholar attains highest honors. The **Golden Hall (Jīndiàn)** transmits the successful candidates, the **Ministry of Rites (Lǐbù)** raises the cups, and the **Prefect of the Imperial Capital (Jīngzào Yìn)** spreads the canopy to honor the **court’s recognition of virtue (cháotiān zhēngxián zhī yì)**. The heretical sects thus falsely equate the **canopy-spreading Emperor of the Heavenly Realm (Zhānggài Jīngzào Yìn)** with the **Great Heavenly Emperor (Dàtiānzūn)**, declaring the **Prefect of the Imperial Capital (Zhānggài Jīngzào Yìn)** as the **Emperor (Huángdì)**. How erroneous this is! Such falsehoods are most perverse.\n\nAs for the claim that **Mount Kunlun (Kūnlún Shān)** has eight abodes: the **Eight Directions** may indeed encompass eight extremes, but all eight extremes converge in the **western-northern direction (xīběi)**, where **Mount Kunlun (Kūnlún Shān)** stands as the **Pillar of Heaven and Cornerstone of Earth (Tiānzhù Dìwéi)**—the Daoist **Mount Xuangu (Xuángǔ Shān)** and the Buddhist **Mount Sumeru (Must Prāṇidhāna)**. How could there be eight of them? The common folk have long been misled by such falsehoods, so now, in examining the **Non-Regressing Realm of Qingwei Heaven (Qīngwēi Tiān)**, I clarify and warn against mistaken theories.\n\n**On the Jade Emperor’s Rank and Status (Yùdì Zūncì Kǎo):**\n**Liu Haichan (Liú Hǎichán)** said: The Jade Emperor, in Daoism, is the **manifestation of the Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)**. Daoists first speak of the **Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)**, then the **Void (Xūwú)** and the **Mysterious Existence (Miàohǔ)**, which are the **Non-Extreme (Wújí)** and **Great Ultimate (Tàijí)**—not implying any hierarchy of superiority or inferiority. In Buddhism, he is the **Ancient Lamp Buddha (Rán Dēng Gǔfó)**, who reveals himself in the **body of Śākyamuni Buddha (Shìjiā Fóshēn)**. Chan Buddhists, however, place the Jade Emperor before the Buddha, following the foreign custom of honoring their **ruler (Zhǔ)** before the **Chinese Emperor (Huángdì)**.\n\nIf we examine the Daoist reverence, the *Golden Wheel Sutra (Jīn Lún Jīng)* states:\n*\"The Jade Emperor mounts the **Mysterious Command Chariot (Yùdòu Xuánmìng Jià)**, his spirit traverses the **Supreme Extremity (Shàngjí)**, with the **Five Stars (Wǔxīng)** as his messengers before him, and the **Buddhas and Devas (Shìfàn)** as his **威仪 (auspicious retinue)** behind him.\"*\n\nThe **Buddhas and Devas (Shìfàn)** are **immortals, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas (Xiānfó Púsà)**. The Jade Emperor’s trust in the **Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)** and the **Buddhas (Fó)** demonstrates his **body (shēn)** and **degree (dù)** to guide all sentient beings, leading them to **return to the Dao (guīdào)**. The common folk, however, arbitrarily divide the **ranks of the divine (shèngwèi)**, failing to investigate the **source and flow (yuánliú)**, and consider the Jade Emperor as a **secondary deity (cìzūn)**—thus implying there are beings greater than the Emperor. Even more absurd, they compare the **Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)** and the **Buddhas (Fó)** to the **Supreme Emperor (Tàishàng Huáng)**, contradicting the **progressive manifestation (xiān-hòu xiǎnhuà)** of the Jade Emperor. Further, they falsely equate the **divine with different surnames and titles (yìxìng yìhào)** to father and son, their offense being even more grave.\n\nAlas! The world cannot do without the Jade Emperor, just as a life must have its **ancestral lineage (zōngzǔ)** and **parents (fùmǔ)**. To defame the Emperor and establish separate sects is to **abandon one’s ancestral lineage and parents while elevating oneself (shě zōngzǔ fùmǔ ér zì zūn)**. How can this be justified?\n\n**On the Jade Emperor’s Auspicious Title (Yùdì Hào Chēng Lìyì Kǎo):**\n**Lan Caihe (Lán Cǎihé)** said: People know to honor the **Emperor of Heaven (Tiānshì)**, yet they do not recognize the **Jade Emperor’s sacred title (Yùdì Bǎohào)**. Confucians may say reciting it is improper, but do they not know that **great filial piety is to revere one’s parents throughout life (Mò fùmǔ ér xīnchéng)**—is this not the teaching of **Mencius (Mèngzǐ)**?\n\nTo **revere one’s parents with sincerity (mò fùmǔ ér xīnchéng)** makes one a **filial son (xiào zǐ)**. To **invoke the Jade Emperor’s title with sincerity (chēng Dìhào ér xīnchéng)** ensures one will never commit transgressions, making them a **true child of Heaven and Earth (Qiánkūn xiāozǐ)**. To **embody the form and emulate the Dao (jiànxíng wéi xiāo)** is to **submit to Heaven and Earth (tiān dì jiēguī)**, and what greater benefit could there be?\n\n**On the Auspicious Benefits of the *Imperial Scripture (Huáng Jīng)* (Huáng Jīng Lìyì Kǎo):**\n**Zhang Ziyang (Zhāng Zǐyáng)** said: With the rise of **imperial rulers (Dìwáng)**, there must be **imperial institutions (Dìwáng zhì)**. Those who transgress these institutions are rare indeed. Yet, the **Heart Seal of the *Imperial Scripture (Huáng Jīng Xīnyìn)**** is the **essence of Daoist practice (Dàodào Zhīyào)**, embodying it makes one the **Supreme Sage (Zhìshèng)**, far beyond merely avoiding transgressions. If people today do not believe in its benefits, it is because they have not **sincerely practiced its recitation and essence (tǐhuì shìchí wèichéng)**. The wise should ponder this.\n\n**On the *Imperial Scripture’s* Record of Merit and Demerit (Dì Jīng Jiàolù Gōngguò Kǎo):**\n**Zhong Lizi (Zhōng Lìzǐ)** said: The **birth of all beings (Rénwù zhī shēng)** originates from the Dao, all receiving **true essence (Zhēn)** from the **Heavenly Emperor (Tiāndì)**. Thus, if one is **virtuous (shàn)**, their **virtue moves Heaven (Dé dòng Tiān)**, and blessings naturally arrive, even if they are poor and lowly, their **tranquility and joy surpass others (ānlè shèng yú tārén)**, making them the **True Hall of Blessings (Zhēn Fú Táng)**. If one is **wicked (è)**, they **create their own calamity (zì zuò niè)**, and Heaven sends **disasters (Tiān xiàng yāng)**—even if they are rich and noble, their **misfortune and retribution (xiōng jiù)** make them an **active hell (Huódì Yù)**.\n\n**Destiny of blessings and calamities (Huòfú)** is fixed, following the **virtue or wickedness of mortals (rén shàn è)**; the **interaction between humans and Heaven (Tiān rén jiāoyìng)** is swift as **echoes and responses (yǐngxiǎng)**. The deluded do not believe this, so they speak of **merit (Gōnggé)** as follows: **\"Sincerely reciting the *Imperial Scripture (Huáng Jīng)*** in its entirety earns **a thousand kinds of merit (qiān zhǒng gōngdé)**, leading one to ascend to **Heaven’s Hall (Shèng Tiān Táng)**.\"**\n\n**\"Sincerely reciting (Zhēn shìchí)\"** means **unifying inner and outer (nèiwài zǒngyī)**, **words and deeds aligning with the Dao (yánxíng hé dào)**, not merely **uttering scriptures with one’s mouth (wéi kǒu shàng niàn jīng)** but **practicing true goodness in one’s heart (wéi xīnxīn shíshàn)**. Truly well said!\n\n**Wang Lingguan (Wáng Língguān)** said: *\"Why should the skilled hand draw my likeness? Only wish your heart align with mine.\"* If one’s heart can **align with the Heavenly Emperor’s (Xīnxīn hé Tiāndì)**, then **virtue and blessings flourish together (Dé fú bìng miào)**, achieving **true recitation and meritorious deeds (Zhēn shìchí shàn gōng)**. As for the rest who merely **recite scriptures and restrain their mouths while disciplining their hearts (Jǐ kǒu zhì xīn)**, though they may have **faith and merit (fúdé)**, their blessings depend on the **size of their virtue (shàn zhī dàxiǎo)**—this is yet another inferior level.\n\n**On the Demerits (Guògé):**\nThey say: *\"If one does not believe in this scripture, they fall into **heterodox paths (xiédào)***, for their **heart does not align with the Dao (xīn bù hé dào)**, thus becoming a **wicked person (yé rén)**.\"* They also say: *\"To **defame true scriptures (huǐ chán zhēn wén)** is to **fall into hell (shēn duò Dìyù)**.\"* Those who do not believe merely **hear of the scripture’s merits (jīngzhōng gōngdé)**, yet fail to **truly embrace them (xīn shì bù jí)**, are guilty of lesser transgressions. But to **defame the scriptures is to erase Heaven’s decrees (fèi Tiān zhāng)***—their **heart commits great evil (xīn zuò dàxiè)**, their **misfortune and retribution (xiōng jiù)** are boundless, sinking them into **dark and malevolent realms (yīn è zhī dì)**, their crimes unforgivable, thus they fall into **the path of hell (Duò Dìyù Lù)**.*\n\nThey further say: *\"To **slander the Emperor and defame the Sages (Dìshì huǐshèng)**, **abolish the divine abode (fèi shén zhù)**, **tear apart true scriptures (liè zhēn jīng)**, and **persist in wickedness without remorse (wán è wú quān)**, will forever suffer **karmic restraints (yè jìn)**, and their **calamity extends to seven generations (huò jí qī zǔ)**.\"* To **defame and tear apart scriptures (huǐliè jīngwén)** is to **blaspheme the sacred texts (kǒu shàn língzhāng)**, their **words dare Heaven’s authority (yán mà Tiān wēi)**, so their **crime rests upon themselves (zuì zài zìjǐ)**. To **slander the Emperor and tear apart scriptures (Dìshì liè jīng)**, to **indulge in evil without repentance (zòng è bù quān)**, makes one’s **body unvirtuous (shēn wéi bùshàn)**, leaving **endless infamy (yí chǒu wúqióng)**, harming one’s **substance (tǐ)** and **dishonoring one’s kin (rú jīn)**.

This is merely **prepared for later generations’ reconciliation (gū bèi hòu rén zhī zhé zhōng ěr)**.*\n\nRegarding the **differences in the Imperial Sutra (Huáng jīng tóng yì kǎo)**:\nZhāng Zǐfáng states:\n*This sutra originally had **no dual names (bēn wú èr míng)** or **distinction between Highest Sage and Supreme Spirit Jewel (gāo shàng líng bǎo zhī fēn)**. Later scholars **erroneously annotated (cūn rén chuān jiàn)**, **arbitrarily adding or subtracting words (suí yì zēng jiǎn zì jù)**, **forcibly linking texts (qiān hé wén)**, and **utterly lost the original intent (shū shī běn zhǐ)**. Now, upon **examining the Highest Sage and Supreme Spirit Jewel (gāo shàng líng bǎo)****,** they stem from **various immortals’ praise (gè xiān zhēn chēng yáng yǔ)**. Later generations mistakenly **took them as two separate texts (wù zhí wéi èr)**. Here, we **adhere to the Mystic Capital’s (Xuándū)** **definitive analysis (dìng lùn)** and **record the transmitted versions (lù chuán shì jiān)**. Later students **should examine this carefully (jiàn zhì mò tǐ)** and, upon encountering **errors in transcription, transmission, or exposition (yù yú kān xiě chuán jiǎo chā chù)**, **cross-reference with authoritative editions (cóng gōng kǎo jiào)**. Any **external additions of words, phrases, or illustrations (wài tiān wén jù zì huà)** are all **erroneous (é wù)**. **Enlightened ones should not rigidly cling to these (dá zhě wù ní zhí yán)**.*\n\nRegarding the **annotations, interpretations, and transmitted commentaries of the Imperial Sutra (Huáng jīng jí zhù kān chuán shū wén)**:\n**Your humble servant, Zhōu Xuándéng**, a **successor of the Complete Perfection (quán zhēn)** **disciple of the Small Dao Master (xiǎo zhào shēn)**, **sincerely fearful and reverent (chéng huáng chéng huáng)**, **prostrates himself with head bowed (qǐ shǒu dùn shǒu)**, **fasting and purifying himself with a hundred bows (zhāi mù bǎi bái)**, **petitions:**\n\n*Truly, the Dao’s **mystery and effortless nature (miào wú wéi)** **manifests itself through time and circumstances (měi yīn shí ér zhuó jiàn)**; **human hearts have awareness (rén xīn yǒu jué)****,** and thus **should accumulate merit according to the place (yí suí dì yǐ jī gōng)**. Your humble servant, **Xuándéng**, though **of lowly disposition (wéi zhì)** and **the least of the Three Talents (sān cái mò pǐn)**, **aspires to the wondrous law and returns to the Mystic (mù miào fǎ yǐ guī xuán)**. Originally **a Confucian scholar (běn rú háng)**, he **later encountered the Dao (huì dào)**. Upon **first glimpsing the Imperial Sutra (yī dǔ Dì jīng)**, he **received its rare and precious truths (shèng huò zhēn yì)**. He **then meticulously studied each character (jí zhú zì yǐ jīng yán)**, hoping to **grasp enlightenment through its words (jì yīn wén ér liǎo wù)**. But since **the sacred texts lack annotations (shèng diǎn wú zhù)**, **true comprehension is difficult (tǐ rèn wéi nán)**.\n\nYour humble servant **devotedly seeks sincere understanding (shēn zhì fā chóng qián)**, **exploring its multifaceted meanings (bó fāng jiě yì)**. He **compiled the Immortals’ and Saints’ sayings (xù zhuàn xiān shèng gé yán)**, **incorporating them into the Daoist Canon (huì rù Dào zàng hán bù)**. For the **three volumes of the true text (yīn sān juàn zhī zhēn wén)**, he **collected and arranged their sequence (yòng jí xù cì)**; for the **five grades of secret teachings (wù pǐn zhī mì lùn)**, he **listed them under chapter titles (yǐ liè piān míng)**. The **ten volumes (juàn biān wéi shí)** total **six hundred sheets (fú jì liù bǎi)**, **encompassing one hundred and eighteen chapters (zǒng liè yībǎi shíbā zhāng)**, with **over tenfold myriad words (dà luè shí yuè wàn yán)**.\n\nThe **heart-laws of a thousand sages (qiān shèng xīn fǎ)** **shine forth in these volumes (shǔ cè zhāo rán)**; the **vast sufferings and profound principles (hào jié xuán zōng)** **are visible at a glance (jǔ mù rú zài)**. Though your humble servant **cannot yet fathom the secrets of the Highest Sage (wèi néng dú kuī shàng shèng zhī yùn ào)**, he **hopes to at least enable others to witness the most exalted true texts (shì zhòng shí wén)**. **Even a small effort has its effect (cùn láo jì xiào)**; **a good connection may yet endure (liáng yuán ruò cún)**.\n\n**With humble devotion (qiān jí)** to the **auspicious morning (cháo)** and **reverent diligence (qián kè)**, he **provides benefit to those of good faith (zī shàn xìn yǐ xié chéng)**. **The preface of this petition (yù zòu shū cí)**, **presented to the Mystic Judgment (shàng gān xuán jiàn)**, **augments the Emperor and people’s purity (zēng jūn mín qīng jìng zhī fú)** and **pardon the Small Dao Master’s presumption (shè xiǎo zhào jiàn wàng zhī zuì)**. May it **illuminate all realms and directions (shǐ zhū jiè duō fāng)** with the **seventeenfold radiance (shí qī guāng míng zhī zhào chè)**; may it **span past and future (jué jīn qīng gǔ)** and **immerse all in the thirtyfold great vows (shí sān shí dà yuàn zhī táo róng)**. May all **ascend to the Heavy Mystic (zhòng xuán)** and **eternally benefit from the law’s blessings (míng yáng yǒng zhān fǎ lì)**. Though your humble servant’s **sincerity is but a fraction (shǒu shēn xuán zhēng zhī chéng)****,** it **slightly fulfills its purpose (shǎo shēn wàn yī yǐ)**.\n\n**Respectfully submitted (jǐn zòu)**.\n\nRegarding the **meaning, annotations, and chapter arrangement of the sutra (jīng zhù míng yì xù cì kǎo)**:\n*The original text sometimes appears as **one volume (zuò yī juàn zhě)****,** following the **model of the Supreme Ultimate (xiàng Tài jí)**. Others divide it into **three volumes (fēn sān juàn zhě)****,** symbolizing the **Three Talents (sān cái)**. Now, this annotation **comprises ten volumes (jīn zhù zuò shí juàn)****,** representing the **tenfold Supreme Ultimate (shí jí zhī yì)**—for the **Dao’s numbers are complete in ten (dào shù chéng yú shí)**. The **five grades (wù pǐn)** symbolize the **Five Phases (wǔ xíng)**. When the **Five Phases, Four Symbols (sì xiàng), and Eight Trigrams (bā guà)** are combined, they yield **seventeen (dé shí qī)**—all **divisions of the Supreme Ultimate (jiē Tài jí zhī fēn)**. Thus, the **Emperor attains the seventeenfold radiance (Dì yú shí qī guāng míng)**; **Heaven is born (Tiān yǐ shēng)** and **Earth is perfected (dì yǐ chéng)**.\n\nThe **Jade Emperor’s (Yù Dìshì)** **sutra is the **Earth’s (dì)** **curved completion of all things (qū chéng wàn wù)**. Earth’s **numbers are thirty (dì shù sān shí)****,** so the Emperor **manifests thirty kinds of virtue (shì sān shí zhǒng gōng dé)**. The **Emperor’s virtue surpasses the tenfold Supreme Ultimate (Dì dé chāo chū shí jí)****,** hence the **ten titles (jù shí hào)**. After **cultivating for countless kalpas (xiū yì wàn jié)****,** he **embodies the ten thousand virtues (zhōu wàn dé)**. Now, this **six-hundred-sheet annotation (liù bǎi fú zhù)** **mirrors the Fire Scripture’s six hundred chapters (xiàng huǒ jì liù bǎi piān)**; the **one hundred and eighteen chapters (yībǎi shíbā zhāng)** **follow the Emperor’s eighteen hundred precepts (cóng Dì qiān bā bǎi jiè)**. The **tenfold myriad words (shí wàn yú yán)** **reflect the Emperor’s ten thousand wondrous and mystic deeds (xiàng Dì shí wàn miào xíng xuán guāng)**.\n\nAs for the so-called *Imperial Sutra Annotation (Huáng jīng zhuàn)*, your humble servant fears that **the lowly and ignorant (xià yú)** **cannot fully align with the sacred text (bù néng quán qì shèng wén)**. He **summarizes the essentials (jǔ dà yào)** to **instruct others (yǐ zhào rù)**. Knowing this **intent (yì)****,** how could there be **divergent interpretations (bù tóng zhī zhǐ)**?\n\nRegarding **contemplation, recitation, and exposition of the sutra’s precepts and teachings (guān sòng jiǎng shòu jīngdiǎn jiè yì)**:\n**When observing or reciting any sutra (fán guān sòng zhū jīng)**, or **lecturing and transmitting its teachings (huò jiǎng míng shòu jiè)**, one must first **fast and purify oneself (zhāi míng zhěng yī)**, **adorn oneself in proper attire (yī zhuóng)****,** and **reverently place the sutra on a clean table (sù róng qǐng jīng zhì jìng qǐ shàng)**. **Sitting upright and steadying one’s mind (duān zuò dìng zhì)****,** one should **forget both good and evil (shàn è liǎng wàng)****,** **abandon all vehicles (yī chéng bù lì)****,** and **att",

      "translated_text": "**Copying Sutra Precepts**\nFor all who copy the sutras, the ritual observances are the same as for recitation. With a rectified mind and a true pen, it is not for the sake of fine calligraphy—this very act is the Dao itself.\n\n**Distinguishing Similar and Divergent Names of the Sutra**\nCarefully examining *Baopuzi* states: *\"The Highest Above\"* refers to the sovereign of all sentient beings, reaching the utmost limits of Heaven—its height is unmatched, corresponding to the Buddhist term *non-retrogression* (不退转之地).\n\nThe *Jade Emperor* is the most revered among the Saints and the most noble among the Gods. All Buddhas and Holy Teachers, all Celestial Emperors, thus earn the title *Jade Emperor*.\n\n*Lü Dongbin* says: *\"Dao supreme and peerless is called Emperor.\"*\n\nThe *Most High Emperor* is boundless in benevolence and trust, surpassing all previous sages in perfect virtue and beauty—praise for Him is endless.\n\nHis station is in *Yuqing* (玉清), proclaiming the transformations of *Yuan Shi* (元始), hence the title *Jade Emperor*.\n\n*Han Xiang* says: *\"The Original Conduct\"* recounts the Jade Emperor’s sacred roots and the cultivation of wondrous practices.\n\n*The Collected Sutra* gathers the five wondrous utterances of *Yuan Shi* into one text, showing posterity the true path of practice.\n\n*Guanshan* says: *\"Only Heaven is supreme,\"* for the Jade Emperor’s abode is the highest Heaven, surpassing all others, hence *\"Highest Above.\"*\n\nMen see the Jade Emperor’s grandeur and assume His virtue is absolute, beyond mortal reach. Yet the Holy Dao knows no division—I stand equal to the Most Holy.\n\nThe Emperor’s majesty, His marvels—these are achieved through conduct.\n\nThus, *Tian Shū* Zhang Shangling transmitted this text, urging men to emulate the Sage and attain True Reality.\n\nThe clear decree states: *\"The Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct and Collected Sutra\"* is meant for men to observe, attain enlightenment, trace the roots of merit, follow the Most Holy, and thus become *Shang Zhen* (上真).\n\nLater, it was also called *\"The Taishang Dongxuan Lingbao Scripture\"*—speaking of the Great Beyond measure, the Highest Beyond reach, hence *Taishang*. It expounds the primordial *De* and *Dao*, serving as the eternal foundation of all scripture. It penetrates the Three *Jing* (景), revealing profound mysteries, hence *Dongxuan*. The essence of *Xuanling* is the eternal treasure of Heaven and man, hence *Lingbao*.\n\nIn essence, the scripture clarifies the Dao, and the Dao belongs to my very self. If man fulfills his nature and attains his destiny, comprehending this Dao, tracing its roots, and embodying it in conduct—then he may enter Sainthood.\n\n**Belief in Scripture and the Discrimination of Ascension and Depravity**\nFrom *Taiji*, man is born and transformed. Heavenly paradises and hellish realms are detailed in the scriptures—yet the world does not believe. Is this mere fabrication?\n\nThough death returns to emptiness, what does not perish is the *hun* (魂) bound by deeds. *Bo You* became a ghostly calamity; *Zi Chan* believed him, and the Master did not deem it false. Are there no hells?\n\nPurified rebirth returns to the cycle of creation; heavenly paradises exist as well. Yet blessings cannot be begged for, and karmic retribution cannot be evaded. Heavenly paradises and hells are shaped by human intent.\n\nIf one believes in these doctrines by name but does not cultivate virtue, he invites disaster himself. Even if he speaks daily of retribution, what good will it do?\n\nFor those who recite the scriptures, there are pure-hearted incantations—these are omitted here. Since earlier teachings aligned the heart with the Dao, this very recitation is the true incantation, so their texts are not recorded.\n\nThe original *Huangjing* (皇经) first listed thirty-six sacred titles, following the meaning of *\"thirty-six from Heaven.\"* Now the scripture retains only ten precepts—why? The ten titles represent the ten extremes, used as the Emperor’s designation. It is not a matter of omitting due to brevity or inclusion. The observer should ponder this carefully.\n\n**Commentary on the *Highest Above Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct and Collected Sutra***\nThis meaning is the *Dongxuan Lingbao*’s paired exposition—later generations should not doubt it.\n\n**Long Kneeling and Reverent Adoration**\nThis scripture expounds the Jade Emperor’s wondrous conduct as revealed by *Yuan Shi*, so those who recite it must kneel in long reverence, offering sincere devotion.\n\n**Supplication to the Three Pure Ones**\nI humbly address the Three Pure Realms—the supreme, unmatched Three Pure Ones. Knowing the Dao’s height and the Three Pure’s grandeur, I sincerely aspire, surrendering body, spirit, and destiny, ascending to the True Heart.\n\n**Gazing Up in Reverence**\nI supplicate the *Yuqing* (玉清), the *Shangqing* (上清), and the *Taiqing* (太清).\n\nThe Three Pure Realms are the most exalted:\n- *Yuqing* is the sacred realm of *Yuan Shi*,\n- *Shangqing* is the true realm of *Lingbao*,\n- *Taiqing* is the immortal realm of *De* and *Dao*—\nthe Three Pure Ancestors, the Great Celestial Worthy.\n\n**Supplication to the Great Luo Heaven**\nThe boundless celestial expanse where life originates.\n\n*Lü Dongbin* says: *\"The Jade Emperor’s abode is the sovereign of the three thousand great thousand worlds, never retrogressing. Supreme beyond compare, hence *Great Luo* (大罗).\"*\n\nThe *Xuan Qióng* (玄穹) Master—vast and solemn—is the sovereign of all celestial assemblies.\n\n**Supplication to the Three Pure Realms and the Attendant Divine Multitude**\n*Zhang Ziyang* says: *\"Attendant\"* means standing beside. *\"Divine\"* refers to the lofty, ineffable realm beyond sight or hearing. *\"Multitude\"* means all—\nthe *Nine Divine Ones of Primordial Heaven*, the *Heavenly Saints of Later Heaven*, all gods, Buddhas, bodhisattvas, *Arhats*, and *Vajrasattvas*—all are present here.\n\n**The Marvelous Dao Beyond Conception**\nThe most marvelous, supreme Dao—\nthe highest vehicle—\ncannot be grasped by thought,\ncannot be spoken of,\nis beyond conception.\n\n**Entering the Mysterious Gate**\n*Zhang Zifang* says: *\"Entering\"* means attaining through true knowledge and practice. *\"Mysterious Gate\"* is the gate of Daoic principle.\n\nThe myriad marvels of profound mystery are difficult to enter, yet through gradual enlightenment, one enters the Mysterious Gate.\n\nThis is what *Mencius* called *\"dwelling in it securely, then drawing from it deeply,\"* and the scriptures say: *\"Hearing and thinking alone, without practice, leads to emptiness.\"*\n\n**The Sutra’s Marvelous Sound and Profound Essence**\n*\"Loft\"* (抉) means to decide, to extract. *\"Profound Essence\"* is the unfathomable mystery.\n\nThis marvelous scripture extracts divine inspiration from the true realm—this is the extraction of profound essence.\n\n**Guiding the Dust-Ensnared to the Path**\n*Yuan Shi* expounds the marvelous scripture, extracts the profound essence, and guides the dust-bound, lost souls out of the sea of suffering, freeing them from their karmic bonds.\n\n**I Now Purify the Three Karmas**\n*\"I\"* refers to those who read or recite the scripture. *\"Three Karmas\"* are bodily, verbal, and mental deeds. *\"Purify\"* means sincere devotion, permanently abandoning these deeds.\n\n*(The recitation continues with) mouth and heart in unison.*",

Hence, it is called the **Celestial Capital of Jade and the Golden Gate**.*\n\n**The Seven-Treasured Mystic Gardens**\nThe **Celestial Sovereign of White Purity** spoke:\n*The Seven Treasures are: jade of emerald hue, stages of luminous jade, palaces of lapis lazuli, walls inscribed with dragon motifs, white jade citadels, vermilion gates, and golden radiance that pierces all darkness. Another account names them: glass, crystal, pearls, agate, coral, amber, and conch shells. The **Mystic Gardens** are the secret precincts of the **Double Mystery**.*\n\n**The Jade Emperor’s Palace and Ascended Seat of Radiance**\n**Zhang Liang** spoke:\n*\"In the Primordial Origin epoch, the Celestial Venerable ascended to preside over the Jade Emperor’s Palace, ascending the **Great Seat of Radiant Clarity and Mystic Sovereignty**.*\n\n**With the countless assemblies of the Boundless**\nHe expounded the **Sacred Treasure of Pure and Undivided Oneness**.\"\n\n**Zhang Liang** spoke:\n*\"When the Primordial Origin ascended the seat, the boundless true saints gathered in assembly.

The Great Celestial Venerable, within the Qingwei Heavenly Realm, inherently possesses this. The **Celestial Capital of Jade and the Golden Gate**, adorned with the Seven Treasures, is inherently possessed by all. The human body’s **yin-yang vital essence, spirit-qi, and refined essence** are the Seven Treasures of the self. Thus, the **Lingting Mystic Gardens** harmonize heaven and humanity.*\n\n*When the Heavenly Sovereign is serene and composed, the **Seat of Radiant Clarity** may be ascended, and all limbs obey in unison. Concentrating the spirit and aligning with the Dao, one becomes the Celestial Venerable’s seat, joining the Boundless assemblies in proclaiming the **Sacred Treasure of Pure and Undivided Oneness**.*\n\n*Yet the Dao has no fixed form—when one awakens with clarity, one attains the secret realm of subtlety, as straightforward as a great road.

The Jade Emperor, in concert with the celestial immortals and divine true ones, ascended in divine transformation and wondrous prowess. The **Flying Heavenly Great Saints**, the **Three Thousand Great Realms**, and the countless gods of the Boundless—those of the heavenly and earthly planes—along with the **Minor Yang Divine Qi** that responds to invocation, the **Spirit Boys** who attend with reverence, and the **Minor Yin Divine Qi** that transmits decrees, the **Jade Girls** who proclaim transformations—totaling nine hundred million divine beings.*\n\n*Without revealing their divine radiance, they returned to the Primordial Origin’s essence, observing strict purity and holding sacred banners, standing beside the Primordial Origin’s Seat of Radiance.\"*\n\n**The Heavenly Marshal Tian You** spoke:\n*\"Within the human body, there is the **True Sovereign, the Primordial Spirit**, unrestrained in its divine communication. There are also the **Flying Heavenly Great Saints**, whose spirit-qi guards the body. Even in the smallest interstices, there are the **Boundless Divine Kings**, the **Minor Yang’s Mystic Light**, the **Minor Yin’s Divine Motion**, and the **Spirit Boys and Jade Girls**. When the heart aligns with the Dao, the **Nine Hundred Million**—the great numbers of yang vigor—are also present, and the body’s spirits pay homage to the Primordial.*\n\n*‘Observing strict purity’ means the mind is undivided; ‘holding sacred banners’ means the body is without sluggishness.\"*\n\n**Master Guan’s Perspective** spoke:\n*\"Humans are akin to heaven and earth—when clear and unadulterated, the **Primordial Spirit** ascends to the pole.

      "translated_text": "**Divine Prowess (Third Chapter)**\n\nAt this auspicious gathering,\nThe Jade Sovereign, knowing the hour was near, displayed the **Six Perfections** before the assembly, emitting a vast radiant light that illuminated all the **Primordial Dream Palaces** of the boundless heavens. Every realm trembled in response, and the ten directions of the infinite worlds became as transparent as **crystal and glass**, with no obstruction whatsoever.\n\n**Master Zhuang** remarked:\n*\"The Jade Sovereign, aware that the time for the **Mystic Light’s** revelation had arrived and that the moment to propagate the **Law** and transmit the **Scriptures** was at hand, thus manifested the **Six Perfections** before the grand assembly. He emitted the most universal and luminous light, illuminating the boundless heavens, the **Dream Palaces** of all the celestial deities and divine spirits, and every sacred realm they inhabited. All were shaken and awestruck. The infinite worlds of all the **Sages and Buddhas** in the ten directions became as clear as **crystal and glass**, their light penetrating and revealing all without hindrance or concealment.\"*\n\n**Master Zhang Wuzhang** explained:\n*\"The **Six Perfections**—**Vision-Perfection**, **Hearing-Perfection**, **Mind-Touch-Perfection**, **Mind-Meeting-Perfection**, **Foresight-Perfection**, and **Pre-illumination-Perfection**—are what the Buddhist tradition calls the **Six Divine Eyes** and such.\"*\n\n**Master Zhuang** further clarified:\n*\"**Dream Palaces** are the abodes of the celestial emperors and deities—marvelous and resplendent in the heavens, not tainted by dust, never decaying, and unshakably firm. The mortal eye cannot perceive them, hence the term **Dream Palace**.\"*\n\n*\"Every sacred realm is the domain where the deities reside. These realms encompass all worlds—not merely human domains, but also celestial realms, which are also called **worlds**.\"*\n\n*\"Though **crystal** has form and light, it reveals all that it bears; **glass**, though flawless, leaves nothing unseen. The Jade Sovereign’s light penetrates all realms, illuminating even the most hidden—how could there be any obstruction? The comparison is made to help those who might not grasp the meaning directly.\"*\n\n**Master Guan** observed:\n*\"Human nature is inherently luminous, yet when the **Primordial Spirit** strays from its master, obstructions arise. Sometimes one hears without seeing, sees without hearing, knows without speaking, or speaks without knowing. Sometimes one’s perception is clouded between self and others, or confused between past and present—this is the failure of the **Six Perfections**.\"*\n\n*\"If one penetrates the **Nature and Command**, and the **Primordial Spirit** governs its rightful place, then one’s illumination will encompass both heaven and humanity, revealing all within and without. The **Jade Reservoir**, the **Dan Platform**, the **Yellow Court**, and the **Mystic Domain**—these are the original sites of the body’s spirits, where the **Celestial Enclosure** naturally shines. All is illuminated without hindrance, just as **crystal and glass** reveal all without concealment.\"*\n\n*\"Indeed, the **Way** is inherently luminous, yet clarity is not easily attained. One must not be deceived by what is not yet known, nor confused by what is already known. Neither too early nor too late—true awakening is most difficult. If one can emulate the Jade Sovereign, observing the opportune moment to manifest light and renewing it daily without ceasing, then the **Great Illumination** will never dim, and the **Way** will endure.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Divine Prowess (Fourth Chapter)**\n\nThe **Sages of the Ten Directions**, riding upon **Five-Colored Jewel Wheels**, **Lingyu Spotted Jade Chariots**, **Nine-Colored Mystic Dragons**, and **Ten-Sublime Feathered Canopies**, arrived in procession.\n\n**Master Lei Zu** noted:\n*\"The **Ten Directions** encompass the four cardinal points, the four diagonal corners, and the realms above and below. The **Sages** are the divine and holy assemblies of the ten directions.\"*\n\n*\"Witnessing the Jade Sovereign’s radiant light, they ascended their **Five-Colored** jewel-wheeled carriages, **Lingyu** jade chariots, **spotted emerald** banners, **Nine-Colored** mystic dragons, and **Ten-Sublime** feathered canopies.\"*\n\n**Master Bai Yutian** elaborated:\n*\"The **Five Colors** are **blue, yellow, red, white, and black**. **Wheels** are the dual wheels of a chariot. **Chariot** refers to the vehicle itself. **Banner** is the collective term for imperial processional standards. The **Nine Colors** are **blue, red, yellow, white, black, purple, green, the Supreme Mystic hue, and the Golden-Luminous hue**. The **Mystic Dragon** bears the dragon’s form and light but no corporeal frame. **Ten-Sublime** means surpassing all extremes—divine and wondrous, like the feathered canopies of auspicious phoenixes and cranes.\"*\n\n*\"The **Scriptures** state: **Feathered Canopy** refers to a high-stemmed feathered fan. Another account says that when the divine and holy emperors travel, they bear **auspicious feathered standards** as their canopy. The latter explanation is more profound.\"*\n\n**Master Guan** reflected:\n*\"Humans, endowed with the **Primordial Spirits** of the **Five Phases**—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—each possess their own **treasures**. When the **Dao** is perfected, these treasures attend the **Law-Vehicle**. If one can silently pay homage to the **Heavenly Sovereign**, imitating the celestial order, then within one’s body, the spirits gather, and the **Rectified Qi** manifests in splendor. The **Jewel Wheels**, the **Lingyu True Chariots**, the **Emerald Banners**, the **Nine-Qi Mystic-Transformed Dragons**, and the **Ten-Sublime Unmatched Feathered Canopies**—these were all within one’s own person. Why should they belong only to the celestial and divine?\"*\n\n*\"Alas, only the truly enlightened understand this.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Divine Prowess (Fifth Chapter)**\n\nWith **Qilin dancing** and **phoenixes singing**, their **harmonious hymns** resounded—**Divine Consorts** scattering **jewel blossoms**, **Golden Boys** wafting **auspicious mists**, reciting **profound hymns** as they floated through the void.\n\n**Master Xu Qing Tian Shi** described:\n*\"As the **Sages** proceeded, the **Qilin** led in dance, and the **Auspicious Phoenix** harmonized in song, their melodious cries blending in perfect rhythm. The **Celestial Consorts** scattered **jewel flowers**, while the attending **Golden Boys** emitted **auspicious mists**. They chanted **profound hymns**, guarding the divine procession as they floated through the empty heavens toward the **Imperial Capital**.\"*\n\n**The Ten-Direction Assembly** remarked:\n*\"When the divine emperors journey, **Spirit Boys** and **Flower-Gathering Maidens** sing in attendance, while the **Qilin** dances and the **Phoenix** sings, imitating the **Qilin’s** and **Phoenix’s** movements. Hence, it is said: *‘Their hymns resound in harmony.*’ This interpretation is overly forced.\"*\n\n*\"The divine procession includes **Qilin** and **Phoenixes**, akin to the **celestial steeds** that accompany the Emperor today. Moreover, the **Scriptures** state: *‘When the Heavenly Emperor travels, dragons soar and phoenixes dance.’* This reflects the **Supreme Harmony** of the celestial scene.\"*\n\n*\"It is also said: *‘Dragons and leopards long howl in the mountains and forests,’*—this is the **harmonious hymn** of the true **Qilin** and **Phoenix**. Otherwise, why would the **Sage Emperor Shun** compose music on **Qishan Mountain**, summoning the **Phoenix’s** rites and causing all beasts to dance?\"*\n\n*\"Examining the **Scriptures** with this in mind, the earlier explanation is correct.\"*",

Once the guilty beings **clearly understand the causes and effects of their guilt and virtue** (*zuìyè fúdé yīnguǒ yuángù*), along with their **kindred and companions** (*qīnchūn zhùshǔ*), they **perform celestial arts and wondrous music** (*tiān jì miàolè*) before the **Emperor’s throne** (*yì Dì qián*).\n\n**Celestial arts** (*tiān jì*), when **interpreted through the term \"art\"** (*yì*), signifies **their perfection and boundless mastery** (*qiánwéi bùtōng*). **To come before** (*lái yì*), here, means **to arrive** (*zhì*).

The phrase *\"as we have received\"* (*fú méng*) is used **to express lowly submission to the exalted** (*wēicéng yǐngzūn*), and should be understood as such.

Once this **compassionate light is released** (*fàng*), **He takes pity and rescues us** (*liánmǐn jiùbá wǒdéng*), **enabling all to be reborn in heaven** (*jiēdé shēng yú tiānshàng*).

The **Sacred [□] Realm** is where the **Ultimate Truth** reigns, where **emptiness and wondrous manifestation** coalesce; even the gods find it difficult to reach. It is the **land of no retreat**.\n\nBeneath the **Primordial Origin Assembly**, only the **Great Sage** and those of **auspicious karmic connection** may **pay homage and gaze upon** the Sovereign. When the **sutra was being expounded**, all celestial and human beings gathered, and through the **Jade Sovereign’s divine transformation and compassionate guidance**, they were **transported and united** to arrive here.\n\nThus, these celestial and human assemblies **unwittingly and without knowing how**, found themselves beneath the **Primordial Origin Assembly**. At that time, the **Celestial Sovereign** was none other than the **Primordial Origin Celestial Sovereign**. Some may assume these were the **various Heavenly Emperors**, but this is incorrect. At that moment, the **Primordial Origin** and the gathered assembly **witnessed all the Jade Sovereigns’ transformed bodies from the Ten Directions**, **universally assembled** before the **Grand Primordial Assembly**, **displayed without obstruction**, like an **infinite, boundless mirror of radiant light**, illuminating all forms and shadows, **mutually containing and embracing without hindrance**, **encompassing none in exclusion**.\n\nAt that time, the **Great Assembly** prostrated themselves fully, **bowing their heads to the ground**, gazing upward in reverence at the **Jade Sovereign’s divine transformation**—the **most exalted and sacred of all**. The Jade Sovereign is the **Sage Teacher of all Buddhas**, the **Lord of Ten Thousand Heavens**, hence the **most exalted**. This **augments pure, sincere faith**, **deepens resolute aspiration and joy**, **reaffirms commitment to the Dao and returns to the True**, **unwavering in resolve before it can be called sincere**, **truly rejoicing in the Great Dao before it can be called devotion**.\n\nThe assembly **beheld the Jade Sovereign’s wondrous transformation**, their hearts **delighted and sincerely submissive**, hence the **increased aspiration and joy**, their **whole hearts devoted in reliance**. There was **no thought of retreat, destruction, or deviation**; they **arose with the greatest firmness and unwavering sincerity**. A **retreating heart is not firm**; a **wandering heart is not steadfast**. Without firmness and steadfastness, there is **no pure faith, no resolute joy**. Only by **gazing upon the Jade Sovereign with no thought of retreat** does one **awaken the greatest unchanging, indestructible true resolve**, **eternally devoted to the Great Dao**.\n\n**In my humble observation**: Human **qi and spirit** share the same source, yet their transformations differ. If the **heart does not align with the Dao**, even through **guiding and directing**, it remains **not the true path**. Thus, the **spirit does not condense**, the **numinous does not manifest**, and **mysterious transformations cannot emerge**.\n\nIf the **Primordial Spirit condenses into Truth**, **wondrously encompassing all existence**, allowing one to **silently pay homage to the True Emperor**, to **meet in the Mysterious Palace of the Spirit**, **True Suchness unfettered**, **requiring no contrivance**, then the **Jade Sovereign’s divine transformations**—the **Great Divine Pervasiveness**—**unmoving, guiding and uniting the celestial and human**, arrive at the **Primordial Origin’s Pure and Secret Assembly**.\n\nWhen **qi and essence converge in mystical union**, **silently conforming to the Imperial Will**, **unaware and unknowing**, the **Primordial Spirit moves the numinous**, **illuminating all wondrous manifestations**, **without restriction or leakage**, then the **Great Assembly, unaware, ascends to the upper realms**.

      "translated_text": "The threshold between sainthood and mortality—how vast is the divide?\n\nIf one knows the weight of this body’s bonds, that life and death are fleeting yet grave, and does not squander this form, if one recognizes the fourfold debts of gratitude and the gravity of the five constants, if one fulfills one’s duties, clarifies the myriad things, cultivates with reverence, advances in learning to know, and remains steadfast and resolute—heeding virtue and acting upon it without delay—if one examines oneself day and night, preserving integrity from start to finish, unashamed even before the scrutiny of heaven, and never faltering in sincerity, then one aligns with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with the sun and moon in luminosity, with the four seasons in order, and with spirits in fortune and misfortune. Thus, one awaits sainthood without doubt, never slacking for an instant, living in harmony and dying in peace, returning to the primordial transformation, leaving behind a legacy that grows ever brighter—even as the Light-Strong King’s Confession, whose devotion never wavered.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Divine Manifestations**\n\nSuddenly, in a single night, the Queen of Precious Moonlight dreamed of the Most High Dao Lord and the assembled Perfect Ones, their forms radiant as gold, their voices pure as jade, their essence untainted and luminous. They rode upon a five-colored dragon carriage, surrounded by banners of dazzling splendor, their seals and flags casting protective shadows. A canopy of resplendent clouds enveloped them.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Dao Lord sat serenely upon the dragon carriage, cradling an infant. The child’s every pore emitted a hundred billion rays of light, illuminating the royal palaces in hues of priceless treasures, with banners and flags leading the way as they floated through the void.\n\nSeeing this, the Queen’s heart filled with joy. She knelt in reverence before the Dao Lord and humbly petitioned: *\"My lord, the king has no heir. I pray you grant this child to be the sovereign of our realm. May your boundless compassion hear my plea and bestow this child upon me.\"*\n\nThe Dao Lord replied: *\"I grant this child to you.\"*\n\nThe Queen bowed in gratitude and took the child. Upon waking, she found herself with child. After a year, on the ninth day of the first month in the Year of the Fire Horse, at noon, a son was born in the royal palace.\n\nThe Venerable Lord Guangsheng declared: *\"The Light-Strong King’s prayer for an heir was answered—his resolve never faltered.\"*\n\n---\n\nSuddenly, in one night, the Queen of Precious Moonlight dreamed of the Most High Lord of Supreme Treasure Dao and the assembled Perfect Saints, their forms gleaming with golden radiance, their bodies smooth as jade, their divine light pure and unblemished. They rode upon a five-colored dragon-borne palanquin, attended by banners of radiant splendor and flags of dazzling glory, their seals casting protective shadows beneath a canopy of luminous cloud-mist.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Dao Lord sat composedly within the five-colored dragon carriage, holding a divine infant. From every pore of the child’s body, a hundred billion wondrous lights emanated, illuminating the royal halls in the splendor of a hundred treasures. Banners and flags led the way, floating through the void.\n\nSeeing the Dao Lord holding the divine child, the Queen’s heart filled with delight. She knelt in reverence and respectfully addressed the Dao Lord: *\"My lord, the king has no heir. I humbly beseech you to grant this holy child as the sovereign of our land. May your great compassion pity the king’s childlessness and grant my request, bestowing this child upon me.\"*\n\nThe Dao Lord answered the Queen: *\"I specially grant this child to you.\"*\n\nThe Queen then paid her respects and thanked the Dao Lord before receiving the child. Upon waking from the dream, she found herself with child. After a year of pregnancy, on the ninth day of the first month in the Year of the Fire Horse, at noon, a son was born in the palace of the Light-Strong King of Wondrous Joy.\n\n**A Note from the Unworthy:**\nMankind’s birth is endowed with essence and form, with the principles of duty and life. The body bears the weight of the cosmic order, and life carries the dual responsibility of heaven and earth. Noble and luminous, it is both spiritually enlightened and free. Yet the body is not mere flesh, nor is life a trivial matter.\n\nBy nature, one is of golden essence and jade-like form, pure and unstained. But if one remains in darkness, indulges in delusion, and scorns this precious gift, unable to grasp the divine mystery, to nurture the sacred embryo, then one squanders the family’s most precious treasure—this very body—rendering it useless. Even if one has some self-regard, if one does not comprehend the Dao, if one’s practice is insincere, feigning virtue while indulging in vice, then though one may appear golden without, one is but rotting rags within.\n\nThus, one’s very self cannot be preserved, and though endowed with noble heavenly rank, one’s virtues remain unmanifest. How then can one fulfill one’s form and perfect one’s nature, ensuring that this true master does not decline?\n\nIf one awakens to the profound roots of life and death, aligns with the secrets of heaven and man, penetrates the mysteries of yin and yang, and delves deeply into the workings of creation—if one recognizes one’s ancestral roots, acknowledges one’s parents, sees that which gave birth to one rooted in the receptive, and understands that which nurtured one rooted in the creative—if one refines the golden essence, purifies the jade-like form, attains wonder in the boundless, and comprehends the mysterious in the void, then with the spirit of emptiness one may conceive the truth of marvelous existence, forming a sacred embryo and giving birth to a saintly child. Thus, those who gave birth to one do not labor in vain, and those who nurtured one are not forgotten. With bones of gold and flesh of jade, one transcends form and spirit, withering yet reborn, enduring without end—even as the Queen of Precious Moonlight dreamed of the Most High Dao Lord and the Pure Ones, receiving the holy child as the sovereign of the realm.\n\nMankind is one. Awakening brings divinity; ignorance brings ruin. To perceive the Queen of Precious Moonlight’s prayer for a child is to awaken to the Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Divine Manifestations**\n\nAt the time of his birth, his body radiated a dazzling light, filling the kingdom with its brilliance. His appearance was exquisite beyond measure, and all who beheld him found no satisfaction in gazing upon him.\n\nFrom infancy, he was quick-witted and wise; as he grew, he became compassionate and benevolent. Within his realm, he distributed all treasures and wealth from the royal stores, relieving the destitute, the widowed, the orphaned, the aged, the sick, the hungry, and all suffering beings.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Eighteen: Divine Manifestations**\n\nWith virtue, love, and humility, songs of the Dao resounded; his influence reached the distant lands, and all under heaven revered and followed him, submitting to the **Daoist** Prince of Virtue. The **Highest Dao Lord** rejoiced in his father’s descent.\n\nWhen the Jade Emperor was born, his body emitted a radiant light of precious treasures, illuminating the **Pure and Radiant Realm** of the Light-Strength Kingdom. His form and appearance were wondrously beautiful, and those who gazed upon him never tired of beholding him.\n\nIn his tender youth, he was keen and wise; as he matured, he became compassionate, merciful, and virtuous. Within his own kingdom, from the imperial treasuries and granaries, he freely dispersed all riches and wealth—whether in abundance or measure, without hesitation or stinginess—until all were exhausted, as if scattering them without restraint.\n\nYet if one were to hoard wealth for oneself, it would mean neglecting one’s sovereign, one’s kin, and one’s state. The Jade Emperor, born with divine knowledge, was the **Most Exalted Sage** of perfect conduct—how could he commit such excess?\n\nThe imperial treasuries were not bestowed upon those who already possessed fortune. Instead, they went to the penniless and destitute, those trapped in despair or peril, the widowed husband, the widow, the orphaned child, the childless elder, those without mother or father to lean upon, and in years of famine when grain was scarce or vegetables unripe. To those afflicted with illness, decay, injury, or deformity—all beings in hardship—he granted relief and aid, his virtue flowing from the sincerest depths, not merely as outward show.\n\nWith boundless kindness and compassion, gentle and modest, his blessings extended across the land, his virtue praised in song. From the borderlands to the distant wilderness, his influence spread, and all under heaven looked to him in reverence, submitting to the **Daoist** Prince of Virtue.\n\n*\"Submit\"* means to join with him. The *Analects* says: *\"If one day you practice self-restraint and return to the Dao, all under heaven will submit to virtue.\"* Indeed, seeking the Dao brings swift attainment, and its effects are vast.\n\nThe Jade Emperor was born with divine marvels, and as he grew, his boundless compassion and virtue made all under heaven submit to him. His father rejoiced all the more.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Divine Manifestations**\n\nLater, the king suddenly passed away. The **Daoist** Prince, now ruler, cast his gaze upon the transient nature of life—*\"floating life\"*, for human existence is like a cloud in the sky or a floating leaf on water, fleeting and unable to endure. He issued decrees to his ministers, declaring that the throne should be passed to one who followed the Dao.\n\nThus, he abandoned his kingdom and retreated to the **Universal Clarity Fragrant Mountain** to cultivate the **Great Dao**. His merit was fulfilled, and he transcended the mundane world, ascending to the heavens.\n\nThe **Fighting Mother** said: When the **Daoist** Prince of Virtue ruled the **Wondrous Joy Kingdom**, and all under heaven submitted to virtue, the king suddenly died.\n\nThe **Daoist** Prince took the throne, governing the affairs of his kingdom. He cast his gaze upon the transient nature of life—*\"floating life\"*, for human existence is like a cloud in the sky or a floating leaf on water, fleeting and unable to endure. Having reflected thus, he commanded his ministers, declaring that the imperial treasure should be passed to one who followed the Dao and practiced goodness.\n\nOr it may be said: He entrusted the throne to his ministers, who were to inherit it by following the Dao and doing good. The intent remains the same.\n\nHaving entrusted the throne to the virtuous, he abandoned his kingdom and concealed himself within the **Universal Clarity Fragrant Mountain**, cultivating the **Great Dao**. The **Universal Clarity Fragrant Mountain**, according to ancient records, is the **Stonehead Mountain** of the Eastern Sea. The other mountains where the Jade Emperor left traces and expounded teachings are not the same as this Fragrant Mountain.\n\nOnce the **Daoist** Prince entered the mountain to cultivate, his merit was fulfilled, and he transcended the mundane world, ascending to the heavens.\n\n---\n\nThe **Daoist** Prince, though born as a mortal, possessed the **True Vital Qi** of life. With this **True Qi**, one may become human. This **True Qi**, when in the heavens and earth, is the **Wondrous Principle**; when in the body, it is the **Boundless Virtue**.\n\nThe **True Qi** is profound and luminous, its light self-arising, illuminating past and present, encompassing all of **Dharma-Realm**. If one fully embodies this principle, one need not suffer hardship or peril, nor face the world’s revulsion. Yet if one abandons it in the heavens, neglects it in the body, and fails to preserve the **True Nature of Inherited Virtue**, one cannot nurture the **True Qi** to give birth to **Divine Transformation**, nor refine the **Mysterious Mechanism** to achieve **Spiritual Manifestation**. Instead, one remains obscured and dim, filled with resentment and jealousy, greedy for gain and fame, hoarding without end, unconcerned with **Daoist Morality**, unmoved by the suffering of the poor, arrogant and self-praised, inviting slander and defamation. This is to harm the **True Qi**, weaken the **Boundless Virtue**, and sink oneself into the realm of the common and ignorant, unable to attain sainthood.\n\nIf, however, one preserves the **Great Harmony**, concentrates the **Secret Intent**, and the **Sage Embryo** radiates **Precious Light**, the **Divine Infant** emits **Wondrous Scenery**, gradually unfolding **Profound Deities**, with **Spiritual Manifestation** unimpeded—if one regards **worldly power and advantage** as mud and **honors and glory** as dust, using one’s abundance to aid others’ lack, benefiting all beings and extending mercy universally, accepting the rise and fall of one’s fate without ceasing—then one’s **merit and virtue** are boundless. One’s **Great Virtue and Divine Transformation** endure forever, earning the name of **Daoist Sage**, and all of **Dharma-Realm** is bathed in compassion.\n\nThe gods rejoice, and mortals are pleased, offering service to the **Most Exalted Virtue**. Thus, the child of the heavens and earth appears in the world as a wondrous being, and even his parents are honored and delighted.\n\nThis is the divine marvel of the Jade Emperor’s birth.\n\nAs he grew, his compassion and virtue were boundless, and all under heaven submitted to him. His father rejoiced all the more.\n\n---",

Each time he assumed the throne, it was for the sake of guiding and transforming beings, severing all ties of kinship to study the **True Dao**.\"*\n\n**Kalpas** vary in scale—sixty years constitute a **Dust-Kalpa**, five hundred years a **Pure and Auspicious Assembly-Kalpa**, three thousand years a **Leap-Kalpa**; eighteen thousand years mark a **Small Kalpa**, while one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years define a **Wheel-Kalpa**. When these accumulate into myriad **kalpas**, they form a **Great Kalpa**.\n\nThough eight hundred **kalpas** may encompass both small and great, the emphasis lies in their enduring duration—roughly eight hundred **kalpas** in number.\n\nAfter severing attachments to study the **Dao**, he spent another eight hundred **kalpas** administering medicinal elixirs, healing ailments, and rescuing suffering beings, granting them prosperity and joy.\n\nWhen these **kalpas** concluded, he spent another eight hundred employing vast **skillful means**, unveiling the **Daoist Canon’s** sacred texts, reciting **Profound and Sacred Scriptures**, expanding the **True and Great Teaching**, and disseminating **Divine Scripture’s** virtues—assisting the state and saving the people, from the obscure to the luminous.\n\nSome say *\"from the hidden to the manifest\"*—from the **Dark Realm** to the **Bright World**, encompassing all beneath heaven and earth.\n\nThis meaning is also coherent.\n\nAfter these **kalpas**, he endured another eight hundred, sacrificing his life without regret, enduring humiliation and insult, offering his own flesh and blood—yet taking others’ wealth as if it were his own, for men’s gifts are like the sacrifice of blood and flesh.\n\nIn a past **kalpa**, the **Jade Emperor** endured humiliation, accepting others’ wealth even in dire poverty and suffering, when insults were heaped upon him. Though others could not bear such hardship, he felt no retreat or remorse—this was his **Sacrifice of Body and Life**, his **Patience and Tolerance**, his offering of **flesh and blood**.\n\nLosing one’s parents is a trial even the common man finds unbearable, yet this was necessary to achieve what others could not.\n\nHaving attained **Supreme Sageship**, the **Emperor’s** act of accepting **flesh and blood** was also inevitable.\n\nYet the **Sage** transforms and guides the ignorant—nothing is beyond his capacity. Through **Divine Manifestations** and **Mysterious Transformations**, his true form remains unharmed.\n\nLet the discerning understand the **Divine Harmony**; do not be bound by mere words.\n\nFrom the eight hundred **kalpas** of severing attachments to study the **Dao**, through healing with medicine, teaching scriptures to deliver beings, and enduring humiliation while accepting offerings—such **ascetic practices** and **mysterious deeds** spanned **three thousand two hundred kalpas** before he attained the rank of **Golden Immortal**, bearing the fruit of **Unspoiled Perfection**, named **Pure and Natural Mysterious Awakened **Dharma** King**, teaching all **Bodhisattvas** and **Great **Sages** the sudden enlightenment of the **Great Vehicle’s True Doctrine**, gradually entering the **Void, Profound, True, and Mysterious Supreme Dao**.\n\nThe term **\"Thus-Come-One\"** signifies that all beings possess **Nature**—endowed with ten thousand virtues. Yet those who abandon this **Nature** fail to preserve heaven’s bestowal, their **True Suchness** obscured to the extreme, and they fall into mundane deeds.\n\nBefore his cultivation, the **Jade Emperor** abandoned the **Wondrous Bliss** royal station and spent another **three thousand two hundred kalpas**, his **virtues and transformations** boundless, never retreating, unattached and unstained, the **Great Awakened **Dharma** King**, encompassing heaven and earth, shaping all things—yet leaving none behind. Those who restore their **body and **Nature** to wholeness surpass even this by ten thousandfold; such is the **\"Thus-Come-One.\"**\n\nAfter such **great cultivation**, another ten million **kalpas** passed before he attained the rank of **Jade Emperor**, **Teacher of Ten Thousand **Heavens**.\n\nWhen **Primordial Heavenly Venerable** spoke these words, the **Pure Assembly** of **Dharma** in unison exclaimed in wonder, for such **Sagely Virtue** had never been witnessed before.\n\n**Reflection:** Man’s life is governed by **Yin** and **Yang**, his thoughts by **Principle** and **Desire**.\n\n**Yin** and **Yang** are interdependent, alternately waxing and waning;\n**Principle** and **Desire** cannot coexist—when **Desire** stirs, **Yin** congeals; when **Principle** is pure, **Yang** flourishes.\nFlourishing and reaching **Transformation**, one enters the **Divine and Mysterious**.",

All **celestial beings, immortals, divine saints, and sacred assemblies** beheld this **Great Bright Light**, and **clouds swiftly gathered in assembly**.\n\nThe clouds converged—**suddenly filling the sky**, unknown in origin.\nThe **sacred assembly gathered like clouds**, hence the term **\"cloud-gathering\"**.\n\nIts light shone downward upon the **boundless worlds of the Lower Realm**, all aligned with the **Pure and Subtle Heavenly Pure Domain**, drawing near to the **Nine Sovereign Celestial Heights**.

Their **resonant, vibrant sounds** in the **Cloud Court** all coalesce into the **Three Caverns’ Precious Chapters**.\n\nAll beings in the **Lower Realms** attained the **Great Dao’s profound transformation**. The **Yin-Tu prisons**, the **Iron Encircled City**, the **Eternal Night of the Nine Abysses**—all tormented souls in the **Nine Hells** now **reverently submit to the Jade Emperor’s Great Bright Light’s power**, ascending to **celestial palaces** and receiving **bliss**.\n\nToday, the **Heavenly Treasures’ wondrous flowers** I scattered **swirled and formed a canopy**, **overshadowing the sacred law-assembly’s gathering**, all **reverently submitting to the Heavenly Sovereign Jade Emperor’s mighty virtue and divine power**.\n\nI, the **Clear and Bright Heavenly Sovereign**, and others—this is not merely fortune for one age. Encountering this **rare marvel**, we have cultivated **meritorious causes across countless eons**, now meeting the **Nine-Heaven’s auspicious convergence**. The **Heavenly Dao’s boundless expanse** flourishes, the **Supreme Mysterious Law** thrives in grandeur.\n\nOne says: *\"The Primordial Sovereign’s enlightenment unfolded the **Supreme Law**, the **august winds** were pure and vast, the **Dao** spread evenly—no heretical paths existed, just the **flourishing of the True Law**.\"* This is acceptable.\n\nToday’s **auspicious hour** is **greatly fortunate**.

The **sea of suffering and karmic pits** are **forever annihilated**; one **transcends the Six Desires**, **rises above the Four Brahmā**, **gathers all spirits**, and **illuminates the hidden realms**.\n\nThe **divine winds stir the true**, the **wondrous resonance is unparalleled**—the **true scriptures circulate without cessation**, all things **receive endless grace**. The **Yin-Tu prisons are broken**, the **Nine Abysses illuminated**, the **hells transformed into pure lands**, and **sinful beings attain bliss**.

      "translated_text": "The **Great Radiance** names are thus: the **Great God-Transcending Radiance**, the **Great Compassionate Radiance**, the **Great Joyous Renunciation Radiance**, the **Great Enduring Suffering Radiance**, the **Great Equanimous Radiance**, the **Great Gentle Harmony Radiance**, the **Great Autonomous Radiance**, the **Great Beneficial Radiance**, the **Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiance**, the **Great Wisdom Radiance**, the **Great Auspicious Radiance**, the **Great Liberation Radiance**, the **Great Refuge Radiance**, the **Great Virtue/Power Radiance**, the **Great Perfect Radiance**, the **Great Unobstructed Radiance**, and the **Radiance No One Can Surpass**—these are the seventeen great radiance lights.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** universally extends and illuminates all things, with wondrous deeds and accumulated proofs, possessing great **virtue/power** and **qi** and attaining the six **god-transcending** abilities. The **Great God-Transcending Radiance** is resplendent, pervading all. This is the first radiance name.\n\nNext, the **Celestial Sovereign** possesses great compassion and great pity; compassion and pity are boundless, and the radiance is wondrous and vast. The **Great Compassionate Radiance** is the second.\n\nAgain, the **Celestial Sovereign** truly rejoices in renunciation; renunciation is boundless, and the wondrous radiance universally shines. The **Great Joyous Renunciation Radiance** is the third.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** has endured great suffering through countless eons; endurance is limitless, and the radiance is unceasing, with no obstruction. The **Great Enduring Suffering Radiance** is the fourth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** has practiced great equanimity in the past; equanimity is unending, and the radiance is unassailable. The **Great Equanimous Radiance** is the fifth.\n\nIn past eons, the **Celestial Sovereign** has also cultivated great gentle harmony; gentle and yielding, yet tranquil and harmonious, this vast **Dao/Way** never alters, and the radiance pervades all, inexhaustible. The **Great Gentle Harmony Radiance** is the sixth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign’s** **virtue/power** is serene and unchanging, transcending all and autonomous. The radiance is vast and boundless, with no end. The **Great Autonomous Radiance** is the seventh.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign’s** benevolence is boundless, encompassing all and benefiting them eternally; the benefits are endless, and the law’s radiance universally illuminates. The **Great Beneficial Radiance** is the eighth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign’s** body transcends all proofs and attains wondrous awakening, pure and natural. The **Celestial Sovereign** is the **Dharma King** of the **Buddha’s** coming, and after countless eons of cultivation, the **Celestial Sovereign** attains this station. Thus, the greatest **virtue/power** emerges from the mindless, and **god-transcending** transformations align with wishes. The **Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiance** is the ninth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** possesses great wisdom and great **palpitating insight** (大慧). Wisdom and insight surpass all kinds, and the radiance is peerless. The **Great Wisdom Radiance** is the tenth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** is fundamentally the most exalted goodness, forever auspicious. With this radiance, all is illuminated without cessation. The **Great Auspicious Radiance** is the eleventh.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** has long understood and attained great liberation; liberation is natural and unconstrained, and the golden radiance endures. The **Great Liberation Radiance** is the twelfth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** aligns with the **Great Dao/Way**, and the wondrous law is natural and unchanging. The **Celestial Sovereign** has maintained true faith through countless eons, never generating doubt or regression. All beings in the ten directions and future ages universally revere and submit to this eternal radiance, never dimming. The **Great Refuge Radiance** is the thirteenth.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** universally saves all beings without exception, with **virtue/power** most vast, and the radiance shines eternally without depletion. The **Great Virtue/Power Radiance** is the fourteenth.\n\nWith **virtue/power** complete and the **Dao/Way** fulfilled, the **Celestial Sovereign’s** **virtue/power** is perfect, and the radiance endures forever in splendor. The **Great Perfect Radiance** is the fifteenth.\n\nThough stained by dust, the **Celestial Sovereign** is inherently pure; **god-transcending** transformations are complete and radiant, and the **Celestial Sovereign’s** **virtue/power** shines eternally without obstruction. The **Great Unobstructed Radiance** is the sixteenth.\n\nAmong **god-transcending** beings, this is the most noble; among sages, this is the most revered. The **Celestial Sovereign** is the master of all heavens, the teacher of all **Buddhas**, and no being in the vast **Dao/Way** of the **Dharma Realm** can compare to the **Celestial Sovereign**. Therefore, the radiance perpetually fills all realms, and the **god-transcending** transformations are beyond measure. Is not the **Radiance No One Can Surpass** the seventeenth great radiance?\n\nAs for these seventeen great radiance lights of **god-transcending** and wondrous meaning, only the **Celestial Sovereign** of today can truly perceive them. How can **god-transcending** beings measure this?\n\nThe fool notes: In the mortal world, upright nature is the root. Therefore, the **Dao/Way** of immortals is actualized, with this as the **Great Radiance** seed. Yet though all true seeds are possessed, none preserve them. Thus, in the field of delusion, one must cultivate and purify the **karma** of causes and conditions.\n\nTherefore, there is one kind of supreme excellent cause, and there is one level of **god-transcending** and wondrous radiance. The **Celestial Sovereign** has cultivated countless wondrous deeds, which are beyond measure. Why speak of seventeen great radiance lights? It is because the **Dao/Way** is profound and difficult to comprehend, and the transformations are intricate, making the **Dao/Way** dim.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign’s** seventeen radiance lights are like the **Buddha’s** manifestation of the **Dharmakāya** (丈六身), with the crown emitting the **Great Auspicious Radiance**. Moreover, the **Celestial Sovereign’s** radiance is supremely wondrous, transcending all kinds. Who can trace the wondrous deeds or recognize the seventeen great meanings?\n\nAlas, this is rare and difficult to attain! The **Dao/Way** is inherently within oneself; neglect leads to dimness, while diligence brings clarity. Cultivate the **Way** of **non-action** (无为) with steadfast effort, and do not seek swift **god-transcending** transformations. The **Dao/Way** will naturally be obtained.\n\nThus, the thirty-second chapter of the **God-Transcending** section states: Therefore, you mortals who desire to see the **Celestial Sovereign** yet cannot do so, it is because you still cling to the **body** and **mouth** (身口), failing to abandon your **karmic habits** (结习). Your **afflictions** and deeds are ever-present.\n\nBecause of these obstructions, you cannot behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s** compassionate visage. Now, I proclaim the **Dharma** of breaking through these obstructions for you, the assembly of the **Dharma**. You, the great assembly, should each earnestly follow this.\n\nAt that time, all the great assembly rejoiced and leapt for joy, bowing their heads before the **Highest Venerable One** (至尊) and the **mortal** (凡) alike, all desiring to hear the teachings.\n\nThe **Thunder Sage** (雷师), **Bright Old Man** (皓翁), said: The **Celestial Sovereign** emits seventeen great radiance lights, transcending all measure. Therefore, you lofty, pure, and clear **Celestial Sovereigns** and **masters of the heavens** (高虚清明天主等), who desire to truly see the **Celestial Sovereign** yet cannot do so, it is because though you have no dusty stains, you have not yet attained the station of the **Celestial Sovereign**. The **Great Vehicle** (大乘) of supreme wondrousness has not been truly understood.\n\nYou still cling to the **body** and **mouth** (身口), failing to abandon **karmic habits** from countless eons, **ignorance** and **afflictions**, **mortal** deeds and transgressions. Because of these obstructions, you cannot behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s** compassionate visage.\n\n**Karmic habits** (结习), **emotional desires**, and dusty **mortal** things: all delusions and entanglements are fundamentally not to be coveted. Yet due to insufficient wisdom and excessive attachment to thoughts, the rise of perceptions leads to gradual staining and clinging. Interacting with things and beings, these entanglements grow ever deeper, forming **karmic toxins** (结毒) that solidify into **habits** (习气).\n\nLike a man binding himself with ropes, it is difficult to untangle in a moment. Deep-rooted **karmic habits** and past stains are hard to remove once they have taken hold. The **karmic seeds** and **roots of deeds** are inherently impure; clinging to **mortal** desires may either harbor **afflictions** or accumulate transgressions, or plant **karmic seeds**, entangling one in endless **karma**, restless and chaotic. The **afflictions** and disturbances have not yet been dispelled, and the **karmic deeds** of past lives continue to obstruct.\n\nEven though you govern the **Brahma realms** (梵天), you have not yet attained ultimate clarity, nor do you fully comprehend the **Heavenly Mysteries** (重玄). How could you then behold the most supreme **Celestial Sovereign**? This is why you cannot see the **Celestial Sovereign**.",

      "translated_text": "Now I proclaim to you, the gathered assembly, the method for cutting through and removing obstructions. You, the great assembly, should each uphold and practice it with sincerity.\n\nAt that time, the great assembly, overcome with joy and exultation, all knelt before the **Celestial Sovereign’s** jade case, bowing their heads and prostrating, reverently offering their respects, all desiring to hear the secret discourse on dispelling obstructions.\n\n*\"I\"* refers to **Primordial Beginning** (元始), *\"case\"* (几) means *\"table.\"* A note: From birth, each has inherent predispositions. Though the **Great Cycle** (元会) begins anew and the **Great Harmony qi** (太和之气) flows, the accumulated habits of past eons are not easily forgotten. Thus, the scriptures liken predestined **karmic affinities** to accumulated toxins—a true insight.\n\nTherefore, those with **affinities for joy** will find kindred hearts across distant realms, while those bound by **malevolent affinities** may stand face-to-face yet remain a thousand miles apart. Do not dismiss the *Dao Canon*’s **functional frameworks** or Buddhist scriptural records as heretical—even in Confucian texts, Yan Ying’s opposition to Confucius was later attributed to **fate’s decree**. The great scholars Cheng Yi and Su Shi split into the **Shu** and **Lu factions**, another case of **incompatible affinities**. Yet even those who must rely on one another often meet with estrangement—a lament shared across ages. Can the doctrine of **affinities** then be entirely discarded?\n\nThus, the **Ten Perceptions** are inexhaustible, the **Five Aggregates** unfathomable, the **Thirteen Disciples** and **Twenty-Five Magical Seeds** endless, the **Seven False and Three True** transformations intricate—who can easily escape them all?\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign**, having attained the **Pure and Bright Heavenly Lord’s** imperial throne, though freed from earthly defilements, still bears the **accumulated karma of past kalpas**, not yet fully transcended. His essence lingers in the **lofty void**, known as **Pure and Bright**. Past virtuous causes remain untouched by the **void’s embrace**. How could one who embodies **Void-Luminous Perfection** like the **Celestial Sovereign** be seen at once?\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures note that even **Bodhisattvas**, in their practice, may see the face of the **Tathāgata** yet fail to truly behold him. When the **Dharma-body Buddha** expounds the **supreme truth**, the Bodhisattvas listen in silence—this is the same principle. The **Most Sage** is not easily seen; the obstructions of **body and speech habits** are not easily dispelled.\n\nYet this truth is most difficult to grasp. To *\"see\"* the **Celestial Sovereign** is not to see him with the eyes; to **comprehend** his **Way** is to **penetrate** his **virtue**. As in Confucius’ door—those who truly receive the **Master’s transmission of the heart-mind**, one in essence—though times and worlds differ, the principle remains the same. **Spiritual communion** and **heart-meeting** alone yield true vision.\n\nEven **Yan Hui**, the bright and discerning disciple, failed to grasp the **subtle interval**; how then could the **Pure and Bright Heavenly Lord** see the **Celestial Sovereign**, and why doubt it?\n\nThe **Primordial Beginning’s** method of **breaking through obstructions** lies in **luminous predestined practice**, **penetrating the heart’s essence**, and **repelling and harmonizing**—once the outer obstructions dissolve, the **Celestial Sovereign** is seen. Thus, the assembly longs to hear it.\n\nAlas! Obstructions arise from the heart; breaking them depends on the **self**. The **Great Unimpeded Way** is within your **original spirit**—do not grow weary in crossing. **Coarse traces of speech and hearing** should not become hindrances. Is the **Great Dao** not within you? Strive onward.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Perfection of Spiritual Penetration**\nThe **Celestial Worthy** spoke: *\"The method of cutting through obstructions lies in generating **great wisdom**, free from doubt, free from **greed and anger**, free from **lustful desires**, free from **envy and jealousy**, free from **harm and killing**, free from **mundane emotions**, free from **mundane thoughts**, free from **delusion and filth**, free from **sounds and colors**, free from **right and wrong**, free from **hatred and love**, free from **discrimination**, free from **arrogance**, free from **attachment**.\"*\n\n**Master Guangcheng** said: *\"The **Primordial Beginning Celestial Worthy**, responding to the Pure Assembly’s request for the **mystery of unobstructed perfection**, spoke thus: To cut through obstructions and behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s** wondrous transformation and luminous visage, the **Way** is none other than generating **divine wisdom and great enlightenment**, firmly believing in the **True Path**, free from **doubt, wavering, and confusion**. The **Great Dao** is supremely upright; **True Unity** admits no duality—there is nothing to doubt or confuse.\n\nIf **clarity** is insufficient to discern the **subtle signs**, one may cling to **contradictory extremes**, lacking steadfast vision, and **demonic knowledge** seizes the opportunity. Once one knows the **Great Dao** resides within, **knowing and guarding firmly**, do not waver with **duality**, nor mix with **triplicity**—what more is there to doubt? Without doubt, there is no confusion; the **Dao** can be entered.\n\nThus, the **great wisdom** that cuts through obstructions and purifies **accumulated habits** must first be free from doubt. Seekers of the **Way** must not measure progress by **worldly gains**, nor rely on external means. **Anger, resentment, indignation, and grievance** must all be abandoned.\n\nThe second obstruction to cut: **greed and anger**. Let the mind be **single-minded in the Dao**; its sincerity will follow naturally. **Nurturing private desires** and **wandering thoughts** easily arise—even a hair’s breadth of **lewd indulgence or craving** greatly disturbs the **True**.\n\nThe third obstruction: **lustful desires**. The **Dao** encompasses all; the **virtuous and unworthy** are both my teachers. If you harbor the slightest **resentment toward the capable** or **disdain for the foolish**, it is a grave error.\n\nThe fourth obstruction: **envy and jealousy**. The **Great Dao** is supremely compassionate, **unbearingly tolerant**. If, out of **hostility or malice**, you nurture **destructive intentions**, you stray far from the **Way**.\n\nThe fifth obstruction: **harm and killing**. Though the *Yin-Xing Classic* speaks of **\"killing the mechanism\"**, it means subduing **evil demons** so that **ultimate truth** may act freely. As in **autumn’s killing frost**, when plants return to the roots and **life’s vitality withdraws**, one sees the **compassion of Heaven and Earth**—this is not the **world’s** notion of killing. It is also said: *\"Harm gives rise to kindness.\"* This reflects the **mind-intent of Heaven and Earth**, not the **world’s** notion of harm.\n\nThe **Great Dao** acts without action; **emotions and perceptions** are not employed. A single **mundane impulse** leads to boundless error.\n\nThe sixth obstruction: **mundane emotions**. The **Dao’s intent** requires **pure thoughts**. Any **dust-thought** brings boundless ruin.\n\nThe seventh obstruction: **mundane thoughts**. The **Dao** is **unblemished purity**; the slightest **delusion or filth** betrays the **ultimate truth**.\n\nThe eighth obstruction: **sounds and colors**. To seek the **Dao** through them is to distance oneself from it. Those who embody the **Dao** do not merely avoid **external sounds and colors**—they remain untouched by the **world**, standing beyond the **Dao’s ripples and shores**, seeking and clinging to nothing.",

      "translated_text": "The ninth obstruction to be severed: **no arising of sounds and colors**.\n\nThe **Dao** is **Great Unity** in its essence. The slightest affirmation or negation betrays its **original true nature**.\n\nThe tenth obstruction: **no arising of right and wrong**. Though Mencius says, *\"The mind of right and wrong, all people possess,\"*—**great wisdom** is like **foolishness**; why would one cling to distinctions of right and wrong?\n\nThe **Dao** knows no preference or rejection. Love or hatred obstructs the **true**.\n\nThe eleventh obstruction: **no arising of hatred or love**. The **principle** is **without duality**; applying **discriminating intelligence** is not the **Dao**.\n\nThe twelfth method of severing obstructions: **no arising of distinctions**. Seeing the **Dao** clearly, transcending the **mundane**, disdaining worldly affairs—**arrogance** greatly violates the **Way**.\n\nThe thirteenth method of severing obstructions: **no arising of prideful or contemptuous thoughts**.\n\nThe **Dao** is **lively and boundless**; its **ultimate essence** cannot be grasped. Severing the thirteen obstructions, the **Dao** is attained. Though called *\"attainment of the Dao,\"* in truth, there is nothing to attain. If one clings to any **fixed possession**, the **principle** remains obstructed, bound by **dharma**.\n\nThe fourteenth and final method of severing obstructions: **no arising of attachment**.\n\n**My humble reflection**: The **Dao** in humanity is **innately unobstructed**. Only when **worldly affairs and discriminating thoughts** veil it does one lose the **Way**. Thus, the **Primordial Origin** compassionately instructs the *Gate of Severing Obstructions* to the **Pure Assembly**, enumerating all obstacles, urging all to **resolutely aspire** and not be hindered by difficulties. To break free from **worldly obstructions** and transcend **dharma’s confines**, then the **Jade Emperor’s divine radiance** will reveal itself—**my wondrous essence** will shine forth, and **Yue** will see it clearly. Though so, severing these two obstructions opens the **Dao’s gate**. The **Divine Transformation** and **Mysterious Depths** are yet to be expounded in later teachings.\n\n**Chapter on the Divine Passages (34th Chapter)**:\nConcentrate the **divine essence**, clarify the **thoughts**—all **spirits** are subdued. The **heart** becomes **Primordial Void**, **inner and outer** untainted and pure, containing all without exclusion, accepting all without reservation. Do not allow **external evils** to disturb your **Supreme Dao**, drag you away from the **True Principle**, ruin your **numinous root**, or steal your **Ultimate Treasure**, lest you fall into **endless mundane existence**, trapped in the **world’s net**, assailed by **ten thousand demons**, and for **hundreds of thousands of kalpas** hear no **wondrous dharma**, while **ghosts and spirits** seize the chance to condemn you, from birth into death.\n\nThus, you must **resolutely cultivate**, safeguard the **True Principle**, and never let it be lost. As previously stated, all these obstructions must be **severed by you**. With **body pure and thoughts clear**, you transcend all **difficulties**—this is the **Dao’s Treasure**, the **pillar of upholding the Law**.\n\nLiu Haichan says: *\"The Primordial Origin teaches the method of severing obstructions; it generates **great wisdom** and cuts off the **fourteen paths of karmic inclination**.\"* What is its **ultimate fruition**?\n\nSevering obstructions and removing veils, **divine clarity** and **pure thoughts** arise. **Silently dwell** in the **Primordial Spirit** and **Mysterious Origin**, **concentrate the Primordial Spirit**, and **clarify all thoughts**—all **spirits** harmonize and **submerge**. The **heart** is like **endless void**, **inner and outer** steadfast, pure, and white. All **mundane dharmas** and **living beings** are contained without limit, embraced without exclusion.\n\nMoreover, **fix the vision and guard it firmly**, never wavering—do not let **external evils** confuse your **Supreme Rectitude** and **Great Dao**, nor drag you away from the **True Primordial Principle**, lest you ruin your **Ultimate Numinous Root**, steal your **inherent, unshareable, indestructible Treasure**, and cause you to **accumulate kalpas** in **endless mundane existence**, sinking deep into the **net of worldly dust**, with **demonic afflictions** relentlessly assaulting you. For **hundreds of thousands of kalpas**, you will be ensnared by **demonic deeds**, hearing no **Supreme True Wondrous Law**, while **ghosts and spirits** seize the opportunity to **condemn and slay** you, from birth into death.\n\nThus, you **Law Assembly** must **sincerely resolve**, **self-protect the innate True Principle**, and never let it be **lost or abandoned**. As previously stated, all **doubts and obstructions** must be **exterminated and severed**. The **fourteen obstructions**, including **external evils**, **birth and death**, and **mundane inclinations**, are all encompassed within.\n\nOnce all obstructions are **severed and cut off**, the **body attains true purity and clarity**, transcending the **three realms’ karmic cycles** and **sufferings**. This is the **method of severing obstructions**—the **Dao’s Ultimate Treasure**, the **great pillar supporting the True Law**.\n\nTemples, halls, pagodas, palaces, gates, and dwellings—without **pillars and beams**, their construction is difficult. Cultivating the **Dao** to **perfection**, entering **sainthood** and transcending **mundanity**—without **severing obstructions**, liberation is impossible. Severing all obstructions ensures **eternal freedom from ruin**, and the **True Law** flourishes.\n\nThus, the **Celestial Sovereign** regards **severing obstructions** as the **pillar upholding the Law**.\n\n**My humble reflection**: Humanity’s **inherent true nature** and **Primordial Spirit** are **pure and untainted**, **unbroken through kalpas**, naturally **serene and content**, and **never cease to be luminous**, undivided from **sainthood and truth**. If **clarity** persists without end, how could the **Jade Emperor’s divine transformation** and **wondrous light** not be **witnessed clearly**?\n\nYet, **thoughts** cling to the **heart**, perpetuating and unchanging. Those who **slightly understand the Dao** still hope for **rapid results**, so **deep-seated habits** linger, **afflictions** persist, and the **Imperial Light** remains unseen. If **true enlightenment** and **mysterious penetration** are **perfectly achieved**, the **ultimate fruit** is **unshakable**—knowing **nature and life** as **true**, recognizing **all things** as **illusionary**, one **sees the Dao** and **forgets things**, then **walks the Dao** and **forgets people**, **attains the Dao** and **forgets self**, **completes the Dao** and **forgets the heart**, and **delights in the Dao** and **forgets inclinations**.\n\nThen, **forgetting forgets to forget the true**, **affairs and principles merge**, **true and false are both abandoned**, neither clinging to **sainthood nor mundanity**, nor needing **five ranks of masters and disciples**. **Attainment without attainment**, **guardianship without clinging**, **emptiness yet not empty**, **not divine yet divine**—then **ancient habits are purified**, **accumulated karmas vanish**, **subtle defilements are extinguished**, and one **enters the Supreme**. No longer **drifting in silence** toward the **Celestial Emperor**, sharing **divine essence**; no longer **ringing the bell** of the **Dao’s natural law**, merging with **true principle**—what need is there for **three vehicles** or **all teachings**? The **most exalted in sainthood**, whose **virtues** are **unparalleled**?\n\nAll can **achieve it**—only the **purity of root and dust**, the **perfection of mysterious practice**, and the **wondrousness of effortless action** matter. **No doing, no questioning**.",
      "overlap_context": "ught** brings boundless ruin.\n\nThe seventh obstruction: **mundane thoughts**.

Only those who have transcended the **Daoist** *Xuanzhong* **Earthly Immortal**, the **Buddhist** *Phosat* **Bodhisattva**, and the **Confucian** *Daxian* **Great Sage** and above can achieve this.\n\nNow, mortals seeking the **Dao/Way**, still adhere to the **Most Exalted in Sainthood** (至聖), not deeming the **Great Vehicle** (大乘) as sufficient. In the **Thirty-Fifth Chapter of Divine Powers** (神通品三十五章), you must further cultivate and revere this sacred text, as if standing before the **Celestial Emperor** (玉皇尊帝). Nurture a heart of reverence and awe, focus your contemplation on the **Emperor’s Noble Form** (尊容), and proclaim the **Emperor’s Glorious Titles** (尊號). Only then will you behold the **Compassionate Face** (慈颜), all receive the **Emperor’s Protection and Liberation** (護度), universally hear the **Wondrous Law** (妙法), and personally offer **Devoted Reverence and Sustenance** (祗奉供養), forever free from **rebirth’s cycles** (輪轉).\n\n**Eastern Hua Wood Official** (东华木公) declared: *\"The **Primordial Beginning** (元始) revealed to the multitudes the Law of Severing Obstacles (断障之法), which, being called the **Dao/Way’s Treasure** (道寶) and the **Pillar of the Law** (持法栋梁), was further demonstrated to all as the **Enduring Practice and Devotion** (持久服膺之義). You, the **Pure Assembly** (清眾), having heard the **True Teaching** (正法) today, must further uphold and revere this *Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Scripture* (《玉皇本行經》). By personally reciting this scripture, you stand near the **Jade Emperor’s Noble Sovereign** (玉皇尊帝), generating a heart of **reverence and safeguarding** (尊敬保重).\n\nKnowing the **Noble Scripture** (尊經) prevents profaning the **Dao’s Natural Law** (天道); honoring the **Scripture** (重經) prevents belittling the **Dao’s Treasure** (天寶). Eternal reverence ensures no **disrespect or negligence** (悖慢), and the **Great Dao/Way** is naturally attained.\n\nThis aligns with the *Analects* (《論語》) saying: *\"Revere the **Heavenly Mandate** (天命), and revere the words of the **Sage** (聖人).\"* Yet, to stand near the **Emperor** (是帝) is not to truly behold the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝); if one cannot yet **cross over and meet** (對越) the **Emperor**, then one cannot yet generate **true reverence** (尊重).\n\nFocusing one’s attention and contemplating the **Emperor’s Noble Form and Wondrous Aspect** (尊容妙相) is not merely an act of **imagination** (想像). It is as if the **Emperor** were truly present—then, **devotedly serving the Celestial Sovereign** (昭事上帝), one **unites in virtue with Heaven and Earth** (與天地合德) and becomes the **Most Exalted in Sainthood** (至聖).\n\nBy proclaiming and extolling the **Emperor’s Most Noble Titles** (至尊徽號), you will behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s Great Compassionate Radiance** (玉帝大慈光颜), all receiving the **Emperor’s Protection and Liberation** (護持拔度), universally hearing the **Supreme True Wondrous Law** (無上至真妙法), and personally offering **Devoted Reverence and Sustenance** (祗奉供養) to the **Emperor** (是帝) and the **Scripture** (是經), forever free from **rebirth’s cycles and decline** (輪灭轉移之失).\n\nAnother teaching says: *\"Seeing this sacred text, hearing this wondrous law, and beholding the **Emperor’s Face** (是帝颜), if one can personally and sincerely uphold and offer **reverence and sustenance** (崇奉供養), then one will forever escape the **mundane and profane** (尘凡), free from the **sufferings of rebirth and transmigration** (輪回轉生之苦).\"* A deeper interpretation suggests that the **heart is forever steadfast**, and this is even more profound.\n\n**Doubting Examination** (考疑) states: *\"Confucian texts say, the **Divine** (神) cannot be summoned by mere thought. **Daoist** scriptures say, **Divine Transformation** (神化) requires no contrivance—it follows **Nature** (自然). **Buddhist** scriptures say, if one seeks the **Tathagata** (如來) through **form** (色) or **sound** (音声), one has strayed onto the **erroneous path** (邪道) and cannot behold the **Tathagata**.

With **a humble and cautious heart** (小心翼翼), **devotedly serving without deviation** (祗事不違), one generates **true reverence** (生尊重心).

      "translated_text": "The present gathering of the **Law Assembly** (法会) is a **most auspicious and supreme opportunity** (良缘最胜), a **rare and extraordinary encounter** (奇逢非偶). This assembly, this teaching—**this is the Emperor, this is the Scripture** (此会此闻，是帝是经)—this moment, this instruction (兹时兹训) are **unprecedented since the eons** (历劫以来未曾有也).\n\nSome say, *\"Hearing the saying ‘already finished’\"* (闻是说已) refers **solely to the method of severing the battle-array** (断阵之法), which is **too restrictive**. When the **Primordial Dao Ancestor** (元始道祖) expounded the Scripture, the *Chapter on Divine Powers* (《神通品》) was **already completed** (说已竟), not something spoken after another discourse.\n\nThough divided into **three volumes and five chapters** (三卷五品), the **Divine Instruction** (慈训) was **demonstrated in accordance with its categories**, so the **Heavenly True Ones** (天真) **recited the Scripture in three volumes** (演经列三卷耳). If one were to interpret the **concluding volume’s expressions of praise** (终卷称叹) as mere **ordinary exclamations** (他叹言), it would be **incomplete understanding**.\n\nThus, *\"hearing the saying ‘already finished’\"* (闻是说已) must **comprehensively embrace the preceding discourse**. Let the **readers of the Scripture** (看经者) **examine this carefully**.\n\n**My humble observation:** The **human body’s spirit, qi, blood, and vitality** (人身精神气血) **obey the Heavenly Sovereign** (听命天君). The **wondrous mind** (妙心) is **penetrating and clear** (洞然), the **Heavenly Resonance** (天籁) **emits sound**, the **mind is serene and harmonious** (怡然理顺), the **Great Harmony** (太和) **naturally arises** (油然), hands dance, feet leap—**joy knows no bounds** (快乐无方). **Obtaining the Dao, one forgets artifice** (得道忘机), surpassing all in the world (举世莫尚).\n\nEven the **fourfold assembly of the body** (身亦有四众), upon hearing the teaching, **rejoice and leap in exultation** (欢喜踊跃), **as though they had never before experienced such wonder** (欺未曾有之义也). Yet the world is **immersed in greed and desire** (溺利欲), few **awaken to true understanding** (了悟无人). To **enter sainthood and attain Truehood** (入圣成真) is **rarely seen** (不数见耳).\n\nIf one **hears the Scripture in silent resonance** (闻经默会), the **body embodies Great Harmony** (身具太和), the **mind merges with spiritual transformation** (心融神化), then **is the Emperor’s achievement not within oneself?** (帝功不在我乎?)\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the First Volume’s Chapter Divisions**\nThe **Primordial Heavenly Venerable** (元始天尊) expounded the *Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct* (《玉皇本行集经》). The **Heavenly True Ones** (诸天真) requested an explanation of the **roots of the Emperor’s transformations** (帝化根由). Though their questions varied, they were all **posed at one time** (皆在一时), so **how did the first volume come to be divided into thirty-six chapters?** (如何首卷分三十六章?)\n\nThe Scripture was **indeed delivered in one sitting** (说经固在一时), yet **each question elicited a distinct response** (因问以答，各有不同). Later generations **failed to grasp the Scripture’s essence and intent** (不能明经旨趣), **penetrating the profound instructions of the Most Holy** (洞至圣玄训), hence the **Heavenly True Ones, Imperial Gods, and Five Elders** (诸天帝神真、五老帝君) **recorded and annotated beforehand**, while **Heavenly Yóu** (天猷) **compiled and arranged afterward**.\n\nThe **Imperial Duke of Literature** (文昌帝君) and **Heavenly Pivot Marshal** (天枢上相) **each, in their time, deliberated and corrected**, thus **designating the first section as *The First Chapter: Divine Powers of the Pure Bright Heavenly Palace*** (首分系曰《清微天宫神通品第一》), without further division, for the **Emperor’s divine powers are unparalleled** (帝神通无伦), **supreme and unexcelled** (其居无上).\n\nThe **Primordial Instruction** (元始此训) is **beyond the speech of all immortals and Buddhas** (诸仙佛不能言也). **Bo Yang of the Han-Wei era, Lü Chunyang of the Tang, Qiu Changchun of the Yuan, and Luo Pengan of the Ming** (汉魏伯阳、唐吕纯阳、元丘长春、明罗念庵) **commented on it in great detail**, dividing it into chapters with annotations. Thus, the **first volume’s *Chapter on Divine Powers*** (首卷《神通品》) **comprises thirty-six chapters** (得三十六章).\n\nThis was **not a frivolous dissection of True Speech** (非轻析真语), but rather **a structured division** (故使支分), **aligned with the thirty-six heavens** (从三十六天之义以立章). Moreover, **each division carries profound intent** (截处有旨), the **meanings flow in continuity** (意相统承), **without scattering or dispersing**.\n\nIf the **reciter or observer** (观诵者) **clears the mind and purges distractions** (澄心涤虑), **embodying the Most Holy’s intent in expounding the Scripture** (以体至圣说经之意) and the **uppermost True Ones’ purpose in dividing the chapters** (上真分章之趣), **striving to harmonize one’s spirit with the Holy True Ones** (务使神与圣真相孚), then **the Scripture’s vital essence will flow uninterrupted** (会经血脉贯串). Then, **what division remains among the thirty-six chapters?** (则三十六章又何分?) **How could the Scripture’s intent not be attained?** (说经之旨又岂不可得哉?)\n\nYet **many are mired in the letter** (泥文者多), **few attain silent comprehension** (默识不厌者寡). Some **deem the Scripture useless** (或以经为无益), others **treasure a single phrase as extraordinary** (或得一句以为奇), still others **fixate on a single character as flaw** (或执一字以为病). They **distinguish between the *Lingbao* and *Gaoshang* schools** (别灵宝、高上之名), **lacking the mind to listen to the divine resonance’s marvel** (无心聆神会之妙), thus **failing to awaken to the Dao through the Scripture**, instead **becoming ensnared by textual dogmatism** (反为文字障执), **deepening confusion** (又惑之甚者也).\n\nAlas! **All Scriptures contain supreme utterances** (诸经至语), **each a seal of the heart** (皆为心印). **Through the text, the Dao is glimpsed** (因文见道); **obtaining the Dao, one transcends words** (得道忘言). The **mysterious celestial treatises** (玄穹秘论) are **already the inherent threads of my own being** (悉我固有经纶). **Why doubt its accessibility**, to the point of **lightly slandering it?** (又何疑其难入，至於轻谤) **How fortunate for those who attain even a single insight!** (一得辄幸哉?)\n\n**These concluding remarks** (赘此首末) are **a warning to scholars** (学者戒之).\n\n---\n**The Imperial Scripture’s Annotated Commentary, Volume Four**\n**Conclusion of the First Volume’s Thirty-Six Chapters**\n**Imperial Scripture’s Compiled Commentary, Volume Five**",

In chaotic non-being, the numinous texts were dimly inscribed, neither clear nor obscure, appearing and vanishing. The numinous diagrams unfolded, the arcane symbols shifted, the refined *qi* ascended into the void, riding the mechanism of cosmic correspondence.\n\nThus did the **True Edicts of the Jade Emperor**, the **Secret Seals of the Treasure Scripture**, and the **Inconceivable Supreme Divine Incantations** take form.\n\nThe **Five Elderly Deities**, primordial ancestors of heaven and earth, spoke of the **True Dao of the Jade Emperor’s Scripture**, which could grant longevity to the mortal masses of the Final Age. How did such great efficacy arise?\n\nFrom ancient times, the *Elemental Origin: Mystic Cavern Treasure Scripture—The Great Scarlet Celestial Book* and its **Jade-Lantern Jade Pages True Texts** emerged before the establishment of the *dharma*-realm, before the Elemental Origin’s primordial beginning, within the boundless void. Before the Two Principles had divided, before the Supreme Ultimate’s boundlessness, when heaven and earth lacked foundation, when yin and yang, water and fire had not yet conceived, before the sun and moon shone—amidst boundless murk, where distinctions were nonexistent, only profound obscurity remained.\n\nBefore the Ten Thousand Phenomena arose, who could claim precedence? No trace of cosmic transformation was visible—no ancestor, no lineage. In the boundless void, no *qi* was seen, no form existed, no color could be grasped, no name could be spoken, no shadow or outline remained, no echo or resonance endured. Vast and formless, where could sound or voice be found? In utter silence, the *Elemental Origin: Mystic Cavern Treasure Scripture—Scarlet Book of Jade Pages*’ true texts glimmered—dim yet not invisible, faint yet not entirely obscure, appearing and vanishing, neither purely existent nor purely nonexistent, neither having nor lacking, having yet not permanently having, lacking yet not permanently lacking.\n\nThen the **Elemental Origin’s numinous diagrams** unfolded, the **Arcane Origin’s wondrous transformations** manifested, the **refined *dharma*-breath** ascended through the void, riding the **celestial mechanism**, responding to the auspicious convergence of heaven and humanity. The **Jade Emperor’s Sacred Decrees**, the **Treasure Scripture’s Secret Celestial Seals**, and the **Inconceivable Supreme Divine Incantations**—their boundless, unfathomable virtues thus revealed themselves in hidden forms, and the **wondrous *dharma* endured**.\n\nThe **Scarlet Book**, the **Jade Emperor’s True Scripture**, the **Texts of Marvelous Existence**, were all formed from the primordial *dharma*-breath of the celestial realms, their characters vast—one *zhang* in length—radiant crimson, the **Great Scarlet Gold Scriptures of the Azure Heaven**. Above the Nine Heavens lay the **Jade-Lantern Jade Pages** of the *Elemental Origin: Mystic Cavern Treasure Scripture*. With **precious clouds and jade moisture**, they were thus called the *Jade Pages*.\n\nThey emerged before the Elemental Origin, before heaven and earth’s primordial dawn—not before the Elemental Origin Lord. Before heaven and earth took root—not that heaven and earth lacked the power of transformation—they arose from the void. The **Elemental Origin’s true texts** existed before the Three Thousand Great Realms were established, before the vast kalpas, hence no trace of heaven and earth’s initial division was seen. They appeared and vanished, existing yet indefinable in form, vanishing yet never entirely extinguished in truth.\n\nThe **Jade Emperor’s True Words**, the **Imperial Scripture’s Marvelous Canon**, compassionately saved all without end, enduring through the vast kalpas, permeating the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds yet never exhausted. The celestial realms revered them, the Three Teachings followed them—**the decrees of the tilted kalpa’s *dharma*-realm**.\n\nThe **Secret Seals of the Treasure Scripture**, the **Celestial Cloud Scriptures**, were not easily heard or seen, inconceivable, beyond thought or speech, beyond measure. Thus they endured.\n\nThe **True Texts of the Jade Scripture** existed before the vast kalpas—not newly arising today, but awaiting the auspicious convergence of mechanism and response. The **Dao** permeated the boundless void—what form did it take? Who could perceive it? Though it existed, none knew its existence. Now, as the **True Path should be practiced**, the numinous texts shine forth in hidden splendor, their divine efficacy radiant and manifest.\n\nThus it is said: *They endure*.\n\nThe **True Scripture’s wondrous *dharma*** manifests when the mechanism converges and the response aligns—**a rare and fortunate time**. Those present here, would they dare to presume upon themselves and not seek the *dharma*’s instruction?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three: The Divine Incantations**\n\nThus did heaven and earth obtain it and divide, the Three Luminaries obtain it and shine. The numinous texts flourished, illuminating the Mystic Cavern, emanating from the **First Azure Heaven**, their hues undefinable, their patterns winding, difficult to trace.\n\nThe **Elemental Origin** refined them in the **Mystic Yang Hall**, tempered them in the **Flowing Fire Courtyard**, their pristine sounds preceding the true texts, their radiance gleaming—**Mystic Yang’s *qi* was crimson**, hence the name *Scarlet Book*.\n\nWhen the numinous diagrams blazed, the Five Emperors paid homage to the True One, soaring through the void, circling the Upper Palaces, burning incense and scattering flowers, reciting the sacred verses. At that time, the heavens displayed twelve arcane omens, the earth manifested twenty-four responses, celebrating the Nine Heavens’ numinous mysteries, praising the Three Heavens’ precious brilliance. The **divine winds blew**, the **Imperial Dao flourished**.\n\nThe **Elemental Origin** issued the decree, the **Supreme True One** took up the brush, the **Jade Consort** swept the table, casting gold into tablets, carving jade into scriptures. The Five Elders recorded them, hidden in the **Nine Heavens’ Mystic Capital Hall**. The **Jade Maidens** attended to the incense, the **Great Hua** held the towels, the **Golden Boys** stood guard, the **Jade Steps** faced the hall. The **Nine Heavens’ Jade Scriptures** were beyond the hearing of ghosts and spirits.\n\nOnly the **True Texts of the Jade Scripture** and the **Secret Seals of the Treasure Scripture** endured thus.\n\nTherefore, the **Supreme Ultimate gave birth to the Two Principles**—the clear ascending as *Qian*, the turbid congealing as *Kun*—and heaven and earth obtained them and divided. The **Sun shone**, the **Moon displayed its luster**, the **stars arrayed themselves**, and the Three Luminaries obtained them and radiated light.",

Within the human body, there are **thirty-six thousand divine qi**, varying in clarity, illumination, and strength. Some hold **true faith**, while others harbor **heretical views**; their roots and capacities differ. When they study, they attain what aligns with their inherent nature—thus, there are **Great Vehicle** and **Lesser Vehicle** paths.\n\nThese are the **thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao**, meant to **dispel** the doubts of those who seek and to **respond** to the intentions of those who come to inquire after the **Way**. Some say it is to **respond to the intentions of those destined to come**, each receiving according to their affinity and belief.\n\nThus, those who attain **enlightenment** speak of their doubts **dissolving like ice melting**. The character **dispel** (*shì*) is correct. Those who use **choose** (*zé*) instead are mistaken.\n\nThe **Three Dragons** refer to the **beginning**, **middle**, and **end** of the **Dragon Han** era. Some say: **Dragon Han**, **Dragon Kang**, and **Dragon Zheng**. When **mixed qi** universally dissipates, the age grows auspicious, and **demonic influences** subside. The **Heavens rejoice in assembly**, gathering in times of universal prosperity.

Thus, the **Sages of the Three Teachings** must find the **right time**, the **right place**, and the **right person** before they **deliver the Law** and **transmit the Dao**.\n\nThe **Golden Decree** is compared to the **Mystic Decree**—it judges **merit and demerit** according to the **Law’s ordinances**. To **bow and rise before the Divine Kings** means to **look upward to the Immortals and downward to the Heavenly Kings and Marshal-Gods**, acknowledging the **Law’s** noble benefits.\n\nTo **govern the Primordial Sovereign’s Heavens** is to **command and lead** the Heavens transformed by the **Primordial Origin**.

To **assemble and lead the Heavens** is to **draw near to the **Law Vehicle** of the **Primordial Origin’s** highest Heaven. Both interpretations are valid.\n\n---\n**Chapter on Divine Incantations**\n\nThen, the **Five Elder Celestial Sovereigns**, along with the **True Saints**, offered **pure incense**, upheld the **Precepts**, and wandered the **Cloud Paths**, summoning the **Ten Directions** with their **whistled commands**.

They lingered along the **Cloud Paths**, chanting and commanding the **Ten Directions’ Holy Ones**, ascending to the **Upper Pure Supreme Mystic Jade Capital**, the **Heavenly Palace of Wondrous Realms**, the **Cold-Spirit Elixir Throne Hall**, and the **Purple Micro Upper Mystic Palace**, receiving the **Decree of Bowing and Rising**.\n\nOnly then did they grasp the **Heavenly Texts’ True Scripture’s** exalted and solemn nature—how rare and difficult it is to hear immediately.

They **guarded the Heavenly Sovereign’s Law Precepts**, wandering in boundless compassion, their **Mystic Light Vehicle** commanding the **Ten Directions** along the **Cloud Paths**.\n\nThe ancient scholars said: *\"Heavenly Light and Cloud Shadows wander together\"*—this is the meaning. It is not like the worldly **hesitation and back-and-forth movement**.\n\n**Whistled Commands to the Ten Directions**—the **whistle** (*xiào*) is pronounced as **decree** (*chè*), not as **laugh** (*xiào*). Those who read it as **finesse** (*xiù*) are mistaken. The **whistle** is a solemn proclamation, not a jest or laughter.\n\n**Ten Directions** refers not to the **Ten Sacred Treasures**, but to the **Ten Directional Divine Departments**.\n\nTo **ascend to the Immortals** is to **pay homage to the Primordial** and receive the **Law**, ascending in **Mystic Light** in silence, reverently listening to the **Mystic Teachings**—not the mundane climbing of steps.\n\nThe **Cold-Spirit Elixir Hall** lies above the **Nine Heavens**, where there is no sound or breath; the sun and moon cannot reach it. The **Heavenly Light** shines of its own accord, vast and boundless, pure and coldly solemn. The **Elixir Hall** radiates **Great Vermilion Jade Light**, hence the name.\n\nThe **Purple Micro Upper Palace** is the **Upper Mystic Palace** within the **Taiwei Heaven** above the **Purple Confluence**—not the **Purple Micro Enclosure** or **Taiwei Enclosure** as known in the mundane world.\n\n**Bowing and Rising Decree**—see earlier explanation.\n\n**Difficult to hear immediately** does not mean it is hard to hear at that very moment, but that it is difficult to **hear and immediately comprehend**. Some say: the **Heavenly Capital’s Scripture Keepers** do not allow immediate hearing. Returning, they once more ascend to the **Primordial Sovereign’s Nine Heavens**, paying homage to the **Supreme Primordial**, and are granted the **rituals of prohibition and precept**.\n\n**Inquire**—see earlier explanation. To ask about the **Heavenly Law’s rituals** for transmitting and receiving the **Law**.\n\n**Prohibition** refers to **decrees**; **Precept** refers to **statutes**.\n\n**Humbly apologizing for inadequacy** does not mean they could not uphold prohibitions or observe precepts, but that they modestly acknowledged their **insufficient wisdom**—though their bodies were divine and their **Law Treasures** had never been truly penetrated, hearing them at once left their wisdom **unable to grasp** the depth. This is the true nobility of the **Five Old Ones’ Heavenly Dao**.\n\nIt is not self-imposed limitation, but the recognition that they were **unworthy to receive** this.\n\nAll things under Heaven have their **principles** and can **hear the Dao**. Thus, the **Four Spirits** gather their respective talents. Humans are the **most spiritual** of all things, and **Divine Beings** are the **highest rank** in the world—how could they not hear the **Dao**?\n\nThus, **Yan Hui** daily listened to **Confucius’ teachings** without deviation, as if in ignorance, yet understood through dialogue. After **Zhuo Lu’s** departure, he said, *\"Though I wish to follow, there is no way.\"*\n\nThe **Bodhisattva Manjushrī** transmitted the **Sakyamuni Buddha’s True Law of the True Vehicle**—those who heard it were **deeply moved**.",

Their attire and ritual spaces are meticulously ordered, and they conduct themselves with **reverence, solemnity, and unwavering consistency**—thus embodying **purity and solemnity**.\n\n*Guān* (观), meaning **contemplation**, is where the **divine presence** resides. Those who gaze upon it rise in **awe and respect**—this is indeed the **Great Vision**. Hence, it is called *guān*.\n\nThey establish **grand liturgical rites** (*dàzhài jiào*—**great exorcistic offerings**), harmonizing the inner and outer, uniting the collective will, and rectifying discord through **fasting** (*zhāi*). They **invoke and thank the divine beings** (*qíxiè shénzhī*—**pray to and give thanks to the divine**), repay the heavens and earth, **concentrate virtue upon the divine** (*hé dé yú shén*—**merge virtue with the divine**), and, following the prescribed methods, **attract blessings** (*yīkē qìfú*—**invoke blessings according to the ritual**) through *jiào* (醮).\n\nThey practice the Dao **six times daily** (*liùshí xíngdào*—**sixfold Daoic observance**), not as the common practice of wandering along roads, but simply by **following the ritual to invoke the divine** (*yīkē qìshén*—**invoke the divine according to the ritual**) and **reciting scriptures and Daoic teachings** (*zhuǎnjīng niàndào*—**turning the scriptures and reciting the Dao**).\n\nSome say the **twelve times of day and night** (*shíèr shí*), with **odd hours** (*qíshí*) for activity and **even hours** (*ǒushí*) for stillness. The **six times** (*liùshí*) should be understood as **子, 寅, 辰, 午, 申, 戍**—the **midnight, 3-5 AM, 7-9 AM, noon, 3-5 PM, and 7-9 PM hours**. Alternatively, some interpret it as the **six daytime hours** (*báizhòu liùshí*—**six hours of daylight**). Both interpretations are acceptable.\n\n**Turning the scriptures** (*zhuǎnjīng*) means aligning one’s mind with the Dao, holding the **authentic scriptures** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scriptures**), ensuring that **lands and beings are free from calamity** (*guótǔ wú èjiān*—**countries and beings without hardship**), and attaining **serene peace** (*dé qīngpíng*).\n\nRice, millet, sorghum, beans, and wheat—**the five grains** (*wǔgǔ*)—all flourish in abundance.

Even **sudden misfortunes** (*zùrán zhī biàn*—**sudden changes**), such as **mountains, rivers, winds, and waves** (*shānshuǐ fēngbō*—**mountains, waters, winds, and waves**) bringing peril, cannot harm the practitioner.\n\nIf one enters the mountains and forests and encounters **venomous and ferocious beasts** (*dú è wūshòu*—**poisonous, evil, and fierce beasts**), simply **retain a single thought** (*cúnxiǎng yīniàn*—**hold in mind a single thought**) of the **true scripture** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scripture**), never forgetting this **precious and wondrous method** (*bǎozhāng miàofǎ*—**treasured chapter and marvelous method**).

Yet, each has **objects of reverence, fears, and taboos** (*yǒu jìng, yǒu wèi, yǒu suǒjì*—**things they revere, fear, and avoid**).\n\nThus, **raptorial birds** (*zhìniǎo*—**fierce birds**) **revere the phoenix** (*zūn fèng*—**honor the *fèng* [august bird]**), **ferocious beasts** (*měngshòu*—**fierce beasts**) **bow to the qilin** (*cháo lín*—**pay homage to the *qílín* [auspicious unicorn]**), and **snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and other venomous insects** (*shéxiē wúgǒu zhūdúchóng*—**snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and other poisonous insects**) **fear cranes, *mànghóng* birds, herons, and *pèng* birds** (*wèi guàn mánghóng niǎo hè péng*—**dread the crane, *mànghóng* bird, heron, and *pèng* bird**), vanishing and refraining from their venom.\n\n**Immortal Daoists** (*xiānzhēn*—**immortal sages**) **comprehend the mechanism of life and transformation** (*dá shēnghuà zhī jī*—**grasp the principle of life and change**) and **know the source of control** (*míng kèzhì zhī yuán*—**understand the origin of subjugation**).

If in battle, when weapons are raised and spears and halberds clash, blades interlocking in the two armies’ confrontation, one steadfastly retains the thought and silently recites this true scripture—all the hostile foes assaulting our ranks will retreat and disperse.\n\n**Verification:**\nWeapons are instruments of slaughter. Battle is perilous. In the charge against enemies, arrows and stones fly, blades clash like roaring tigers—an irresolvable struggle. Yet if one steadfastly retains the thought and silently recites this true scripture, how, if one’s heart aligns with the Dao, could the malevolent foes not retreat?\n\nThe military classics say: *\"The morale of three armies can be undermined; the resolve of a general can be shattered.\"* Silently reciting the true scripture, one seizes their spirit and subdues their vitality. This wondrous scripture’s power causes the enemy to lose their resolve, abandoning their will to fight, turning from evil to good, and naturally withdrawing and scattering.\n\n\"Battle\" does not refer to armies numbering ten or twenty-five hundred—rather, when troops form ranks and confront one another in combat. \"Spear combat\" is not a matter of formal distinctions; \"clash\" and \"interlock\" differ little—only following the scripture’s phrasing of weapons meeting in battle. Steadfastly retaining the thought and silently reciting the true scripture is not for mere avoidance of slaughter—it is to devote one’s heart entirely, even facing death without abandoning the Dao.\n\n*\"All\"* means \"many.\" *\"Malevolent foes\"*—some interpret this as \"malevolent\" referring to evil persons, \"foes\" to bandits. This division is incorrect. It simply means hostile rebels.\n\n*\"Retreat and disperse\"* means to withdraw and return, to scatter and depart each to their own.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nThe Venerable Lord transformed in Hu, besieged by the army of Yutian.

These were all great sages.\n\nThe Dao-body, the Dharma-body—constantly turning the true scripture, observing as if assailed by foes. Later, the Venerable Lord radiated the Dao-light, and Yutian submitted. The Sovereign displayed the Heavenly Light, and the Heavenly Demon withdrew. The Buddha manifested the Dharma-light, and the six kings converted. Confucius shone with virtue-light, and when he thrice plucked his lute and thrice sang in harmony, the people of Qi laid down their arms.\n\nThus, they retreated and dispersed.\n\nYet consider that many foes have sworn never to harm the virtuous.

      "translated_text": "「When passions remain unsevered, one cannot govern the world with the Dao/Way, hence these calamities arise. If one truly embodies the Dao/Way and upholds faith in the scripture’s efficacy, even commoners—men and women alike—may avert such trials.\n\nTo doubt the deliverance from death and adversity or to disbelieve the scripture’s teachings is indeed erroneous. Alas, extolling unwavering integrity serves to inspire the world; reciting the scripture’s virtues stirs others to do good.\n\nIn essence, the scripture’s intent lies within the nature of our own inherent Dao/Way. When the six senses (六根) are assailed by thieves (贼) of discord, and one’s mind remains steadfast in the Dao/Way, the six thieves retreat. Thus, even in the face of armies, Heaven itself resolves the peril. Laozi proclaimed: *\"Armies cannot harm.\"* Guanyin declared: *\"The blade seeks only to sever flesh, yet justice prevails.\"* Their words are no deception—this is the natural efficacy of the scripture’s virtue.\n\n**Continuation of the *Merits and Virtues* (功德品) in Chapter 21:**\nIf one finds oneself imprisoned in shackles (枷锁), with a purified mind and settled thoughts, yet ever mindful of this scripture, wrongs shall be redressed and liberation attained. The scripture’s benefits extend far beyond dispersing bandits and armies—even if one has wrongfully incurred guilt and lies in chains, by keeping the heart and mind clear, steadfast in reciting this true scripture, wrongs shall naturally be revealed and deliverance achieved.\n\n**Verification:**\nPrisons exist to confine the guilty. The rewards of virtue and retribution for vice are the immutable laws of Heaven. Once imprisoned for a crime, one cannot simply escape—how then does it say that mindfulness of this scripture brings immediate liberation?\n\nThe phrase *\"wrongs shall be redressed\"* (冤枉自伸) implies that such a person, in their ordinary life, must inherently be virtuous. Perhaps in a past existence they incurred karmic debts (宿世充愆), or in this life they face misfortune (今生运限); or they may have been wrongfully accused (误失过失, 他人挂误), or drawn into another’s crime (先亡连逮, 救人被陷). When suddenly cast into prison, all such cases are unjust.\n\nIf one neither blames Heaven nor resents others, enduring hardship with equanimity (素患难, 行乎患难), free from malice or ill-will (绝无意想), then one’s mind is purified, thoughts settled, and devotion to this true scripture is genuine. Heaven aids the virtuous—wrongs are naturally exposed, requiring no defense, and justice is swiftly rendered. There is no prolonged suffering, for Heaven does not permit enduring injustice; liberation comes at once.\n\n**Definitions:**\nPrison (牢狱): *Lao* (牢) refers to confinement; *yù* (狱) refers to awaiting trial. Modern terms like *jianyáng* (监仓, prison cells) and *pùchǎng* (铺厂, detention centers) vary in severity, but both are places where criminals reside. The two characters do not strictly differentiate—*jiā* (枷) and *suǒ* (锁) are restraints for the guilty, arising from unforeseen circumstances (变故).\n\nSome say: *\"Lao\" derives from cattle (牛), \"yù\" from dogs (犬).* If one refrains from slaughtering cattle and dogs, prison shall be forever avoided. Yet this merely counsels against killing for sustenance (不食牛犬) and restrains the tongue (勿纵口), lest one invite calamity through gluttony (以味招祸).\n\nBeyond the scripture’s core teachings, this is an ancillary note.\n\nThe scripture’s benefits include redressing wrongs and granting liberation—not only for those unjustly imprisoned but also for those who, in ordinary life, have committed crimes yet repent sincerely, harboring no resentment. If one steadfastly relies on the scripture’s power, without faltering, liberation shall come.\n\nKing Wen of Zhou (文王) attained sainthood through the Dao/Way. Imprisoned in *Yǔlǐ* (羑里), he studied the *Yijing* (《易经》) and was pardoned. Gongye Chang (公冶长) aspired to the Dao/Way and became a sage. Though bound in chains (缧绁), he too found release. Xu Shen Gong (徐神公) and Zhang Ziyang (张紫阳) achieved transcendence through the Dao/Way. Despite the torments of *Chāngyì* (昌邑) imprisonment and the Three Refined Ones’ (三配) afflictions, their devoted practice of the supreme Dao/Way and profound transmission of *The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) secured their deliverance.\n\nIt is not only sages who are liberated—even the foolish, if they cast aside worldly attachments (除去维念), place absolute faith in this scripture, shall escape the bonds of prison. The misfortunes of *lao* and *yù* shall dissolve.\n\n**Dispelling Doubts:**\nIn the remote antiquity, there were no guilty criminals nor prisons. The Yellow Emperor (轩辕) captured *Chīyóu* (蚩尤), binding him with fetters (桎梏) and marking the earth to restrain him—thus the concept of prisons emerged. By the Three Dynasties (三代), the system of imprisonment was fully established.\n\nThis scripture was revealed before the age of great calamities (浩劫), when the Primordial Beginning (元始) spoke of it in Heaven. How then does it mention prisons? The truth is that in every age (劫劫), in every place, there are virtuous and wicked. The wicked naturally incur karmic retribution (孽), and the logic of prisons is already inherent.\n\nThe scripture encompasses all dharmas (万法), benefiting all sentient beings (群动) eternally. Its principles are exhaustive—it foretells the power to liberate from guilt.\n\nThe scripture declares: *\"Mindful of Guanyin’s power, chains shall swiftly depart.\"* Confucian texts say: *\"The virtuous man contemplates retribution.\"* The *Great Yijing* (《大易》) states: *\"No calamity comes without cause.\"* How could these not speak of prisons? Thus, the scripture is not a teaching of recent times—it is an ancient, profound revelation (无始玄章).\n\nIn summary, a single mindful thought aligns with virtue (福堂); a single thought of selfishness invites karmic bonds (业狱). If one’s desires and delusions persist unchecked, a pit of karmic debts is dug, and prison becomes inevitable.\n\nMencius said: *\"The difference between humans and beasts is but slight.\"* *Lao* (牢) derives from cattle (牛), *yù* (狱) from dogs (犬). The creator of these characters held deep meaning. Let all present and future beings exert effort and place unwavering faith in this scripture—through every age and place, prisons shall be forever avoided.\n\n**Continuation of the *Merits and Virtues* (功德品) in Chapter 22:**\nIf one is tormented by malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪精鬼贼), yet recites this true scripture in accordance with its methods, the malevolent shall flee, and one shall find peace.\n\nThe divine efficacy of the *Jade Scripture* (玉经) extends beyond liberating from prison—if one is afflicted by all manner of malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪魔精怪鬼贼), and recites this true scripture as prescribed, all malevolent spirits, demons, and thieves shall retreat and vanish, leaving one in natural security and tranquility.\n\n**Verification:**\n*\"If one is\"* (若为) is equivalent to *\"as one is\"* (如为). Malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪精鬼贼) encompass all that is not upright (不正)—spirits that exploit supernatural abilities to wreak havoc (通灵而逞妖异者为精), malevolent entities of the unseen realm (阴之灵者为鬼), and those that harm humans or things (伤人害物曰贼).\n\nSome say *\"贼\"* refers to human malefactors. Yet earlier it was stated that armies and wicked bandits (军阵恶贼) all disperse. How then could *\"贼\"* here mean human wrongdoers? Essentially, malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪魔妖精鬼怪) seize opportunities and exploit weaknesses, entering through the flaws of those who are not virtuous.\n\nTheir origins are unknown—from whence they come; their departures are unfathomable—whither they go. They strike in darkness, inflicting harm without warning, hence they are called *guǐzéi* (鬼贼, demonic thieves).」",

When this scripture is chanted according to the proper method of recitation, with reverent gazing, bowing, and intoning, all malevolent spirits and thieves will retreat.\n\nAlternatively, it is said: *\"As the law prescrices, recite the true scripture\"*—meaning a Daoist practitioner should recite the scripture on behalf of the afflicted. Thus, all malevolent entities will retreat, and the afflicted will naturally find peace, without need for talismans, elixirs, or exorcistic incantations. Upon hearing the scripture, they will flee, and the suffering will cease, leaving none afflicted.\n\nIt is said that the Ancestor Celestial Master subdued all demons with the law. The *Xuandi* (玄帝) cultivated the True Way, annihilating all malevolent *jingyé* (精邪) and governing both human and ghostly realms. The *Sà Zhēnrén* (萨真人) expounded the Dao, banishing evil spirits. The *Lǎojūn* (老君) subdued the celestial demon. The *Fó Fàn* (佛梵) invoked spells to conquer demons.\n\nThe scholar-official *Fàn Wénzhènggōng* (范文正公), after a night on the battlefield, heard only the crowing of a rooster—no ghosts dared act malevolently. *Chéngzǐ* (程子) subdued the *Dàtóuguǐ* (大头鬼), and even when the ghosts moved his bed, his mind remained undisturbed, and the spirits withdrew in hiding.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the Dao is exalted, dragons and tigers submit;\nWhen virtue is profound, ghosts and spirits revere.\"*\n\nTo recite the true scripture as the law prescribes—this secret canon, the most sacred utterance—reveals the unbreakable mechanism by which ghosts and spirits are vanquished. How could any malevolent spirit or demonic thief dare not retreat?\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\nEssentially, within the human body, the *sānshī* (三尸), *wǔqióng* (五穷), *qīpò* (七魄), the *qīqíng* (七情), and *liùyù* (六欲), along with all manner of delusive thoughts and fantasies, and the myriad dark inclinations—all are manifestations of malevolent spirits and thieves. If one awakens to the luminous void and wields the wisdom-sword to slay demons, exhausting all desires, then malevolent spirits and thieves will retreat.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Three of the *Gōngdé Pǐn* (功德品) – Continuation:**\n\nIf one seeks descendants, and reverently upholds and recites this scripture as the law prescribes, the Celestial Sovereign commands the *Tiāncháo* (天曹), who then inspect the *Dānjí* (丹籍) of the Nine Ranks. Among the *sìguǒ xiānrén* (四果仙人), when fate and destiny align, they descend and incarnate to become their child—endowed with eloquence, wisdom, and noble status among mortals.\n\nThe efficacy of this scripture is not merely to subdue malevolent forces. If one, afflicted by childlessness, seeks descendants and upholds this scripture with reverence as prescribed, the Celestial Sovereign commands the *Tiāncháo* to examine the *Dānshū Xiānjí* (丹书仙籍). Among the Nine Ranks, the *sìguǒ xiānrén* (四果仙人), when their cosmic cycles and numerical destinies converge, descend and incarnate to become their child.\n\nThe child born to one who recites this scripture for descendants will be gifted with eloquence, wisdom, and intelligence, attaining noble status among humanity.\n\n*\"Qí\"* (祈) means to pray and supplicate the gods in seeking.\n\nSometimes, others pray for one; other times, one seeks for oneself. Whether one has descendants or not depends on Heaven’s decree—if it cannot be sought, it cannot be sought. Of the three gravest offenses against filial piety, childlessness is the greatest. One must seek descendants, for all who possess *xuèqì* (血气) are capable of procreation.\n\nPerhaps one has exhausted *yīndé* (阴德) or incurred Heaven’s wrath; perhaps one’s *yáng* (阳) and *yīn* (阴) are misaligned, or one’s fate clashes with solitude; perhaps the fetus is weak or one harms oneself in anger, resulting in childlessness.\n\nYet human resolve can reverse Heaven’s decree—through utmost sincerity and divine resonance, none will remain childless. Thus, descendants can be sought.\n\n*\"Sìxī\"* (嗣息) means *\"sì\"* (嗣, to continue) and *\"xī\"* (息, breath). Some say *\"sì\"* means to bind, as in binding the ancestral line like a continuous thread. Others say *\"sì\"* means to govern, overseeing the transmission of family lineage, as recorded in ancestral tablets. *\"Xī\"* (息) refers to children who continue the ancestral line, like the unceasing inhalation and exhalation of breath.\n\nMoreover, the true breath is the root of life and death—if breath ceases, *qì* (气) vanishes. Having descendants ensures the continuity of sacrifices, hence *\"xī\"* (息). *\"Tàidǐ xī\"* (太抵息) refers to the mind itself. With descendants, all concerns are fulfilled, and the mind finds rest—thus it is called *\"xī\"* (息).\n\nThe sages of the Three Teachings all had descendants. How can one not recognize the weight of progeny?\n\nTo uphold this scripture with reverence is to revere the scripture itself. Some say one must personally revere it—which is incorrect. The *Tiāncháo* are those who create destinies and oversee the *Xiānjí* (仙籍). The Nine Ranks consist of the upper three *shèng* (乘), the middle three, and the lower three—totaling nine.\n\nThe *Shìjìng* (释经) states: *\"The Nine-Ranked Lotus is the parent.\"* The Buddha, Bodhisattvas, *Yuánjué* (圆觉), *Shèngwén* (声闻), and *Āluóhàn* (阿罗汉), as well as those in the four *zhān* (禅) stages, also belong to the Nine Ranks.\n\nThe *sìguǒ xiānrén* (四果仙人)—*Xūduōhàn* (须陀洹), *Sītuǒhán* (斯陀含), *Āluóhàn* (阿罗汉), and *Ānàhàn* (阿那含)—descend and incarnate. For the Daoist or Buddhist to take human form is considered descending to the mortal realm, hence *\"jiàngdié xiàshēng\"* (降谪下生).\n\n*\"Cái\"* (才) refers to extraordinary talents; *\"biàn\"* (辩) refers to unparalleled eloquence.",
      "overlap_context": " earlier it was stated that armies and wicked bandits (军阵恶贼) all disperse. How then could *\"贼\"* here mean human wrongdoers? Essentially, malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪魔妖精鬼怪) seize opportunities and exploit weaknesses, entering through the flaws of those who are not virtuous.\n\nTheir origins are unknown—from whence they come; their departures are unfathomable—whither they go. They strike in darkness, inflicting harm without warning, hence they are called *guǐzéi* (鬼贼, demonic thieves).」",

Dao, one must embrace poverty to the marrow of the bones.\"*\nThis suggests that reciting the *Scripture* can bring wealth—\na claim that may entice those who crave prosperity.\n\nYu’s own frugality

are inherently complete within me.\nThere are those who are naturally wealthy without effort.\nYet why do people chase after fame and gain,\ncompete in superficial luxuries,\nindulge in passions and desires,\nand mistake falsehood for truth?\n\nThe poor suffer in distress,\nyet cannot uphold the Great Way,\nnor recite the true *Scriptures*.\nThe rich indulge in extravagance,\nyet cannot abandon

can guard them;\nwealth and rank bring arrogance,\nand one invites ruin upon oneself.\"*\nThis warns against pursuing externals while neglecting the inner self.\n\nNow it is said that reciting the *Scripture* can bring wealth—\nto urge people to abandon their superficial pursuit of riches\nand instead honor the *Scripture*.\nAh, truly, reciting the *Scripture* has its effect.\nIf one lacks sincerity and reverence,\none may only invite transgression.\nLet those who observe the *Scripture* be cautious.\n\n**Chapter 27 of *The Merits and Virtues* (continued):**\nIf one is afflicted by malevolent stars,\nsuffering hardship in life and death,\nand yet recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,\nthen these malevolent stars shall retreat,\nbringing forth auspicious

said: *\"The people are orphaned and destitute,\neach bearing a star upon their brow.\"*\nYet the stars that shine upon them bring either fortune or calamity—\nfortune brings a thousand blessings,\nwhile calamity portends ill omens and punishments.\nThose beneath the Three Luminaries must always avoid such ill influences.\nMalevolent stars are the stars of calamity—\nsuch as **Luohe** (羅睺), **Jidu** (計都), **Tianpo** (天破), **Tianku** (天哭), **Tianbai** (天敗), and **Tianrui** (天退), among others.\n\n**Photo** (照) refers to when stars align with one’s destiny,\nfate, or home—whether at birth, during one’s lifespan,\nor in the celestial divisions of one’s abode.\n**Kun** (困) means one’s desires are not fulfilled,\npressed down and unable to flourish.\n**Ku** (苦) refers to poverty, illness, or danger\nthat directly afflicts the body.\n**Kun and ku in bed and pillow** simply mean\none is trapped in misfortune,\nunable to rest or sleep in peace,\nlying in bed with no comfort.\n\nAnother saying: *\"Bed and pillow are disturbed by fear.\"*\nThese malevolent stars encompass many—\nall celestial omens of calamity that align with one’s destiny,\nfate, or home, and all stars of ill fortune.\n\n**Returning and descending auspicious fortune** means\nthat when malevolent stars shine upon one,\nmisfortune prevails and no blessings follow.\nYet if one recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,\nthe sacred verses shall take effect,\nthe ill omens shall become auspicious,\nand all malevolent stars that afflict one\nshall not only fail to bring misfortune,\nbut shall instead withdraw in silence,\nbestowing blessings and fortune,\nand descending auspicious fortune.\n\nThe influence of stars upon destiny and fate\nis inherently fixed.\nHow then can reciting the *Scripture* cause malevolent stars to bring auspicious fortune?\n\nHeaven and humanity share the same principle—\nabove and below are interconnected,\nand the mechanism of response is swift as light and shadow.\nKing **Shuanggong of Song** had three sayings of a ruler,\none of which was: *\"Retreat when the star **Yinghuo** (荧惑) appears.\"*\n\nIt is not only rulers who can move Heaven—\na filial wife, bearing grief, could bring three years of drought;\na lowly servant, pleading sincerely, could summon frost in the sixth month.\nEven common folk, man or woman,\ncan sway Heaven and Earth,\nand stir the spirits and deities—\nonly fearing their sincerity may not be complete.\n\nIf one’s sincerity reaches Heaven,\neven a single word can win the trust of the divine.\nOne need not speak to influence the transformations of fate—\nhow much more so when the *Scripture* is the essence of Heaven and Earth,\nthe source from which the Three Luminaries draw their

malevolent stars shall disperse,\nauspicious fortune shall arise,\nand ill fate shall turn to blessing.\n\nHumans are all the same—\nthose who follow the path of virtue shall meet fortune,\nthose who oppose it shall meet calamity.\n*The *Central Admonition Scripture* (中诫经)* says:\n*\"When stars shine upon a person,\nfortune or calamity is self-summoned—\ndoing great good, the star’s light shall be manifest;\ndoing no good nor evil, its light shall be faint;\ncommitting minor faults, its light shall scatter;\ncommitting great faults, its light shall vanish.\nIf malevolent stars afflict one,\nit is because of one’s faults—\nthen ill fate shall respond.\nIf one is faultless,\nthe omens shall be averted.\nGoodness shall drive away calamity,\nand blessings shall descend.\"*\n\nThe *Scripture* says: *\"A single thought of evil\nsummons malevolent stars and vengeful spirits;\na single thought of good\nsummons auspicious stars and joyous clouds.\"*\nThe signs of blessing or ruin\ndepend upon the purity of one’s thoughts.\n\nEven in times of great peril and disaster,\nif one truly upholds this *Scripture*,\nthe calamities shall retreat—\nand yet, are there not some afflictions,\nlike restless sleep and sudden misfortunes,\nthat may not be entirely dispelled?\n\nKing **Tai Jia** said: *\"Heaven creates calamities,\nyet they can still be defied.\"*\nThis is the same meaning.\n\nIf one can propagate the Dao,\npraise the nurturing of all things,\nand silently turn the true *Scripture*,\nentering its divine mysteries to reach cosmic transformation,\nthen one shall align with Heaven and Earth in virtue,\nwith the sun and moon in radiance,\nwith the four seasons in order,\nand with the spirits and deities in fortune and calamity.\nOne shall guide the transformations of fate,\nforever transcend the mundane,\nand even the spirits and deities shall not dare to obstruct—\nlife and death shall have no dominion,\nand stars shall not be able to confine or limit one.\n\nLet

efficacy of upholding the *Sutra*—\n**Enlightenment on birth and death.**\nBirth and death are profound matters, their essence most difficult to fathom.\nDependent upon the vital essence and blood of parents,\nreceiving the *li* and *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nlife—this is how one comes to be, yet its origin is unfathomable.\nWhen the essence is exhausted and the *qi* dissipates,\nwhen the spirit departs and the form withers—\ndeath—this is how one ceases to be, yet its end is unfathomable.\nNot knowing life, not knowing death,\nthough one may grasp the changes of affairs,\nobserve the principles of things,\nand speak with clarity while acting without delusion—\nthis is not yet enlightenment.\n\nIf one who upholds the *Sutra* abandons the sacred and forsakes wisdom,\neliminates the two obstructions,\nsevers all delusions,\nfuses innate nature,\nattains great awakening,\nrealizes the Three Primordials,\nascends to the highest state,\nand penetrates the root of birth and death—\nthis is what the Buddhist school calls *perfect enlightenment*.\n\n**Retreating into deep mountains and forests.**\nThe ancients said: *\"The small hidden one resides in the mountains.\"*\nSince one has attained enlightenment,\nwhether high mountain or level plain—\nall are Dao-fields.\nWhy must cultivation necessarily be in mountains and forests?\nThe great hidden one resides in the marketplace—\nthis is also true in principle.\nFamous peaks and scenic wonders,\nwhere the land’s *ling* is potent and sages abound—\ntrue cultivators,\nthough they have no inclination for mountains and forests,\nfind that secluded peaks and lush groves\nare naturally formed as immortal realms.\nThus, the recluse enters them.\n\n**Cultivating the True Way and learning the Dao.**\nHuman nature’s original purity is utterly true, without falsity.\nThe Way of nature is spontaneous, needing no study or inquiry.\nYet as desires grow daily,\none is seduced by external transformations,\nand the true gradually becomes false,\nthe Way of nature obscured.\nThose who attain enlightenment,\nin mountain or forest glades,\nsilently refine their cultivation,\nrestoring the Heavenly True,\npartaking in the Great Dao,\nand transcending birth and death.\n*The Dao De Jing* says: *\"Cease learning, and you will have no worries.\"*\nYet here it says *\"learning the Dao\"*—why?\nThere, *\"cease learning\"* refers to abandoning the names, forms, and thoughts of learning.\nHere, *\"learning the Dao\"* means learning the boundless, effortless Way.\nThe Buddhist school holds enlightenment as supreme.\nYet here, enlightenment is but the beginning—\nonly then does one enter the mountains to cultivate the True Way and learn the Dao.\nThus, the ranks of these two paths are clear.\n\nAt times, those who learn the Dao ascend heights, overlook waters,\ntravel through wondrous landscapes,\nand from mountain peaks survey all four directions.\nWherever their gaze extends—\nwhether mountains, forests, streams, or valleys—\n*valleys*, the hollows and deep chasms of mountains—\nall living beings, both manifest and latent,\nthose already born and those yet unborn,\nincluding those born unseen—\nwhether womb-born, egg-born,\nor generated from moisture and filth,\nor spontaneously arising from nothingness,\nall creeping, flying, swimming, or dormant—\nthe myriad classes of created life,\ntheir past and present sins and karmic bonds,\nall are eradicated.\nTheir bodies and minds are purified,\nfree from all entanglements,\nand at death, they are reborn in Heaven.\n\nThe merits of a True Cultivator’s gaze extending to all things are thus—\nhow much more so for those who uphold this *Sutra*?\nKnow that such a one’s virtue/power is boundless,\nthe very essence of the Dao’s profound藏,\nincalculable,\na body of supreme virtue/power.\n\nThe cultivator’s heart is vast in compassion and love,\nnever without benevolence.\nThough unseen by sight or hearing,\ntheir gaze encompasses all things,\nand in silent reverence, they extend their spirit to rescue all sentient beings,\ndelivering them from the world.\nThus, they save all beings.\n\nAs the Confucian classics say:\n*\"Achieving harmony, all things are nurtured.\"*\n*\"Establishing the Spirit Platform, they observe the encroaching mists,\ndiscerning calamities and omens,\nand through subtle means, complete and assist all things.\"*\nWhat Heaven and Earth cannot reach,\nthey enable humanity and spirits to receive their natural fate,\nreturning to the source of transformation—\nwhat sins or karmic bonds could remain?\n\nThose who praise Confucius say:\n*\"In a single lifetime, one cannot exhaust his learning;\nacross generations, one cannot fully grasp his depth.\"*\nThe ineffable is called divine.\nNow, praising those who cultivate the True Way and learn the Dao,\nwe say: *\"the embodiment of the Dao藏’s virtue/power.\"*\nThis speaks to its boundless embrace,\nits unfathomable depth—\npraise that cannot be exhausted.\nThose who study the *Sutra* will understand this meaning.\n\n**Continuation of the Merits Chapter (Thirty-Five)**\nAt that time, the Celestial Sovereign addressed the Jade Emptiness Emperor:\n*\"Now I have spoken briefly, yet the mysteries remain unfathomed.\nIf I were to expound fully,\nthose with errant views, doubts, and disbelief\nwould

      "translated_text": "「Cultivate the mind and refine the body—this is not achieved through mere chanting and reading, but through sincere, silent practice, with utmost sincerity and selflessness. When spirit and *qi* are complete, the Sage can be emulated, Heaven can be aspired to, the Dao/Way can be entered, and all actions will bring auspicious results; the deities will surely protect you.\n\nWhen the three medicines are depleted and the True Nature is lost, one’s own spirit weakens, *qi* falters, and essence fails to circulate fully—this defies Heaven’s order. How then could the deities protect you?\n\nAlas, all humans share the same essence, but the virtuous who cultivate it thrive in auspiciousness, while the petty who defy it meet disaster. Thus the Scripture says: *\"Those who cover and protect this Scripture will know the blessings of Heaven through virtue.\"*\n\nThe Emperor’s virtue is boundless, and the benefits of this Scripture are supreme—how greatly do people respect and receive it?\n\nThe *Chapter of Protection* decrees: The Vajra Warriors who command life and death, the Four Heavenly Kings of the gates, the Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Waters, as well as all named mountains, the Four Seas and Nine Rivers, the Twelve River Sources, forests, valleys, streams, and marshes—all their ruling deities and their retinues—shall cover and protect those who receive and uphold this Scripture. In all perilous and treacherous places, they shall grant safety and stability.\n\nThe Emperor’s decree extends to all local deities of the lands, including those of ditches and canals, as well as all great-power ghostly kings, commanding them to cover and protect those who receive and uphold this Scripture.\n\nThe Twelve River Sources are now recorded as thirteen names, for two waters share the same source—thus it is called the Twelve River Sources. The decree commands the Subduing Kings and Heavenly Vajra Warriors. The Four Heavenly Kings of the gates are the Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern gatekeepers. The Five Sacred Mountains are: the Eastern **Tài**, Southern **Héng**, Western **Huá**, Northern **Héng**, and Central **Sōng**. The Four Great Waters refer to the deities of the **Jiāng**, **Hé**, **Huái**, and **Jì** rivers.\n\nAll named mountains in the world are included. The Four Seas are the Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern seas. The Nine Rivers include: **Yángzǐ**, **Qiantáng**, **Hànyáng**, **Huìyáng**, **Hùntóng**, **Jǐn Jiāng**, **Xiāng Jiāng**, **Wūlóng**, and **Yālù**, encompassing all rivers.\n\nThe Twelve River Sources are the origins of the Yellow River, the world’s vital vein: such as **Kūnlún**, **Yǔmén**, **Xīngxiù Hǎi**, **Huǒdūn Nǎo’ér**, and its tailing streams, **Fāxiè** and **Fáxiè**, along with the roots of other rivers that flow into it. Another account states that when discussing the Yellow River’s sources, **Kūnlún** has nine wells and seven springs, not just twelve. The Twelve River Sources pertain to the nine rivers—**Túhài**, **Tàishǐ**, **Mǎxiá**, **Fùfǔ**, **Húsū**, **Jiǎnjié**, **Gōu pán**, **Gēlín**, **Rǔ**, **Hàn**, **Huái**, and **Sì**—as well as the **Rǔ**, **Hàn**, **Huái**, and **Sì** waters, totaling twelve.\n\nThe Yellow River is the supreme deity of all rivers. Rivers like **Jīng**, **Wèi**, **Yí**, **Wèn**, **Shēn**, **Wéi**, **Hùtuó**, **Xīngxié**, and **Ruòshuǐ**, along with all other rivers, are its subordinate deities. The forests and mountains encompass all terrestrial groves and peaks. The streams and marshes are all the world’s flowing waters and wetlands. *川* refers to moving waters; *泽* means stagnant waters. All ruling deities of mountains, forests, streams, and marshes, along with their retinues, are commanded to cover and protect those who uphold this Scripture.\n\nIn all hazardous and difficult places, let them have no worries and find stability—this refers specifically to those who hold the Scripture. Wherever the Emperor’s decree reaches, all local deities and responsive spirits of the lands shall heed it. *沟* (gōu) are dry channels, either in mountains or earth; *渠* (qú) are waterways. *等神* (děngshén) includes all minor deities beyond ditches and canals.\n\nAll great-power ghostly kings are likewise commanded to cover and protect those who uphold this Scripture.\n\nThe essence of this Imperial Scripture aligns with the treasures of all Immortals, the teachings of all Buddhas, the practices of all Heavens, the reverence of all deities, and the recitations of all people. Demons and malevolent spirits submit themselves. Indeed, mountains are steadied by it, and waters flow endlessly—its protection is strict and unyielding.\n\nIf those who uphold the Scripture are its very guardians, how then could they dare to be negligent? A single moment of carelessness brings grave sin and deep consequences.\n\nTruly, Confucius said: *\"The petty do not know Heaven’s decree and do not fear it.\"* They mock the great, scorn the words of the Sage—this is the petty. Even in observing this Scripture, one must still guard against arrogance and exert diligence.\n\nThe *Fifth Chapter of Protection* concludes.»",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the Four Assemblies:\n\n*\"All mortals in this world who hold and recite this scripture, receiving and invoking the Sacred Emperor’s name, are deeply rooted in the Dao—just as the Confucian sage speaks of innate endowment pure and profound, or as the Buddhist speaks of favorable roots and capacity. They bear past merits of kindness, having in former ages and past kalpas broadly cultivated hidden virtue, already possessing auspicious connections.\n\nFor the True Way is difficult to hear, the Dharma Assembly rare to encounter, and the blessed night even rarer to meet. Some have lived through ages without hearing the True Dharma; some hear yet do not believe or awaken, failing to grasp it fully or reap its true benefit. These are those whose roots and capacity are shallow, whose karmic connections are thin.\n\nNow, in this Dharma Assembly, hearing the True Dharma and receiving its true benefit—all have through countless kalpas cultivated the Dao, their roots deeply established, their past merits profound. This scripture is sublime and noble, universally saving Heaven and humanity. But with sincere devotion, reverent offering, and humble veneration of this scripture, families and nations achieve peace, life is preserved and disasters averted, longevity secured and calamities dispelled.\n\nThe ancient sages and worthies had birth and death, faced disasters and misfortune—how could they claim to preserve life and avert disasters? Rather, they preserved the Heavenly Mandate and maintained true *qi*, enduring trials with daily ease, meeting death with serenity, finding no distinction between joy and sorrow. This is the true meaning of preserving life and averting disasters through the scripture.\n\nIt sweeps away all inauspiciousness—where the scripture’s power resides, all calamities vanish in secret. The virtuous receive Heaven’s favor, and all disasters are forever removed, leaving no trace of ill fortune.\n\nAs for kings and nobles: the sovereign of all under Heaven is called the *Son of Heaven* (天子), the *Emperor* (皇), or the *Sage Emperor* (帝). In the Zhou, they were called *Kings* (王). In later times, a feudal lord ruling a single state is called a *King* (王), and a vassal holding a fief is called a *Marquess* (侯). In antiquity, a marquess ruled over a hundred *li*.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture bring their nation’s lineage to great peace. Bandits and rebels are naturally subdued—*subdued* meaning pacified. When a land follows the Dao, internal harmony and external might prevail; wicked rebels and bandits do not rise, and the four borderlands submit in tribute, all under Heaven at ease, with no wars on the frontiers. The common folk sing in joy, the land prosperous and at peace, all under Heaven flourishing.\n\nThe celestial cycles turn favorably, the *Zhenyuan* era’s auspicious rotation complete, the natural order restored. Those who possess this Dharma and embody its transformative power are held in reverence by the Celestial Worthies. It is a treasure to be guarded in secrecy—though the Great Dao universally saves all, the unworthy should not be given it lightly. The Buddha’s *True Dharma Eye Treasury* is not casually revealed to all. Confucius said: ‘Those of mediocre or lesser capacity cannot be taught the highest truths.’ True understanding must come from the heart. To treat it lightly is to profane the Heavenly.\n\nThe scripture says *guard it in secrecy*—let those who observe it understand its meaning on their own.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Five: The Manifestation of Retribution and Verification**\n\nAt that time, the Four Venerable Ones—Compassionate Transcendence of Calamities, Seeking-Voice Savior of Suffering, Life-Saving Death-Transcending, and Ten-Thousand Blessings Body-Protecting—all rose from their seats, stepping beyond their ranks, and together addressed the Celestial Venerable:\n\n*'In the latter ages, though mortals may bear past merits and encounter this scripture, if obstructed by malevolent influences—whether from their own heretical views, others’ deceptive teachings, perverse natures, or the hindrances of circumstance and principle—they remain doubtful from beginning to end, unable to believe in this scripture’s virtues. Such persons, in this life and future lives, will suffer what retributive punishments in the hells? We humbly pray the Saintly Compassion may explain the agonies of their retributive realms of suffering.'*\n\nThe Four Venerable Ones—Compassionate Transcendence of Calamities, Seeking-Voice Savior of Suffering, Life-Saving Death-Transcending, and Ten-Thousand Blessings Body-Protecting—all rose from their seats, stepping beyond the ranks of the gods, and together addressed the Primordial Celestial Venerable:\n\n*'In the latter ages, though mortals may bear past merits and encounter this scripture, if obstructed by malevolent influences—whether from their own heretical views, others’ deceptive teachings, perverse natures, or the hindrances of circumstance and principle—they remain doubtful from beginning to end, unable to believe in this scripture’s virtues. Such persons, in this life and future lives, will suffer what retributive punishments in the hells? We humbly pray the Saintly Compassion, the Celestial Venerable, may explain the agonies of their retributive realms of suffering.'*\n\nAll beings bear karmic consciousness, each drawn to their own inclinations—whether good or evil, endlessly cycling through rebirth, unable to escape. The Great Saints and Perfect Ones transcend past habits, uproot defilements, purify consciousness and karma, sever all realms of existence, and with all obstructions removed, suffer no retribution or rebirth.\n\nThe great bodhisattvas, minor immortals, minor saints, divine generals, and ghostly spirits—those of virtue take cultivation as their path, those of vice are bound by their deeds. Virtuous beings need no further mention; the wicked, however, sink into their karmic prisons, their retributions endless, with no escape or remedy. When their karma is exhausted, they are reborn elsewhere, only to be dragged again by karmic ties, lost in delusion, wandering through kalpas without end. Such is their karmic fate—truly pitiful.\n\nThe Four Venerable Ones, moved by great compassion, implored the Celestial Venerable to speak of these retributive sufferings.\n\nNow, regarding the teachings on retribution: Confucian scholars deny it not. *Tai Jia* said: *\"When Heaven inflicts calamity, it may still be averted; when a man brings calamity upon himself, there is no escape.\"* The classics say: *\"Reward the virtuous, punish the licentious.\"* And again: *\"The responses of Heaven and man are swift as echoes.\"* How could they deny retribution?\n\nThe Master said: *\"The gentleman cherishes the penal codes.\"* And again: *\"Fear the Heavenly Mandate.\"* Thus, he does not himself do evil. When Dao and righteousness delight the heart, there is no other path.\n\nIn past dynasties, at the *xiangyin* and archery rites, they taught the people through lectures on law and order, guiding them not by coercion but by nurturing their inherent goodness.",

      "translated_text": "「The teachings of both Dao and Buddhism on retribution and penal codes serve only to uproot their karmic inclinations and lead them toward great virtue. Alas! Only the sage, through divine instruction and governance, commands the reverence of all.\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s merit and virtue are supreme, hence the scriptures clearly demonstrate retribution to rescue beings from evil paths, never deceiving the multitude. If one does not cultivate the True Dao, but merely dazzles others with talk of reward and punishment, this is to deceive them. Those who study the scriptures must renounce desire and attain the True Dao to escape personal retribution and suffering, only then can they save and guide the world.\n\nThe *Yingying* [應驗] chapters continue with twelve more sections. At that time, the Heavenly Sage addressed the Four True Ones [四真人], saying: *\"If there are beings in the world who are obstinate, fierce, and cruel—unbenevolent creatures whose speech and deeds harm all beings—who day and night face the Daoist images without reverence, uttering blasphemous words, they shall incur the crime of falling into the Five Boundless [五無間] Prisons.*\n\nIf they encounter one who holds this scripture, who employs all means to persuade, guide, and rescue them, then such beings—able to extinguish their evil thoughts, take faith in this scripture, and purify all their crimes without remainder—shall be redeemed. At that time, the Original Heavenly Sage addressed the Four True Ones of Compassionate Salvation and Deliverance [慈悲度厄等四真人], saying:\n\n*\"If there are beings in the world who are obstinate, fierce, and cruel—those bold and coarse in name, unbenevolent beings whose speech and deeds harm all beings—who day and night face the Daoist images without reverence, uttering blasphemous words, they shall incur the crime of falling into the Five Boundless [五無間] Prisons. The Five Prisons are the great penal realms of the Underworld; non-sages have no recourse, thus they fall into these crimes. Observe the solar laws [陽律] for blasphemous slander, and you shall know the gravity of slandering the divine.\n\nIf they encounter one who holds this scripture, who employs all means to save and guide them, then those who defy the divine and slander the scriptures have deep-rooted karmic tendencies, clinging stubbornly to their delusions, lacking faith. The scripture-holder, through boundless compassion and skillful means, awakens, persuades, and leads them, revealing their true nature, fostering benevolent thoughts. Thus, those who defy the divine and slander the scriptures, if they extinguish all their evil thoughts, take faith in this scripture, and devote themselves wholly to it, shall have their crimes purified without remainder. Their karmic debts shall be erased, retribution fulfilled, and they shall forever be free from transgression, never returning to cyclic suffering, always pure and clear, with evil retribution forever removed and no unresolved karmic debts remaining.\n\nThe Five Boundless [五無間] hells—where crimes are difficult to purify—if one steadfastly takes faith in the True Scriptures, the evil roots shall be severed, all defilements extinguished, and what bonds remain? The roots and defilements shall be utterly destroyed, with no karmic residue. The divine virtue and scriptural efficacy are the greatest benefits; both Dao and Buddhism emphasize crimes of retribution, sternly warning against defying the divine and slandering the scriptures.\n\nConfucian scholars often admonish irreverence toward spirits and gods—does this mean Confucians do not revere the divine or honor scriptures? The *Book of Odes* states: *\"Do not disgrace your birth.\"* Master Zhang [張子] says: *\"To not fear the gods peering through the roof beams is to disgrace your birth.\"* Again, it says: *\"Cultivate the heart and nurture the nature, without negligence.\"* The teachings of both Dao and Buddhism speak of revering the divine, honoring the scriptures, and fostering the heart to cultivate the Dao, never falling short in devotion to Heaven, Earth, and the divine, and embodying the scriptures’ truth.\n\nConfucians teach that one should not flatter the gods, warning only against seeking rewards through improper reverence. Serving Heaven means fearing Heaven’s mandate, aspiring to Heaven’s will, and honoring the teachings of the ancient kings, with solemn respect like a swift-chariot race or a galloping steed—Confucianism and the two teachings are one in this regard. If sacrifices bring no benefit, reverence is insufficient, and the mandate of Heaven is not to be feared, these are hollow words. Confucian scholars also condemn them sternly—why single out the other two traditions?\n\nAlas! Benevolence and malevolence, reverence and neglect, all arise from the heart. If one can sever emotional desires, abandon worldly perceptions, empty the Five Aggregates [五蘊], and remove the Five Fetters [五累], then one shall not be bound by the Five Elements [五行], nor by Heaven and Earth, and the Five Boundless [五無間] Prisons shall not touch them. The Buddha says: *\"To chant the Buddha’s name transforms the fiery pit into a lotus pond.\"* Mencius says: *\"To recite the words of Yao and follow Yao’s deeds is to be Yao himself.\"* Thus, the true efficacy of virtue and goodness is immediately manifest.\n\nThe *Imperial Canon with Commentaries* [皇經集注] concludes Volume Eight and begins Volume Nine.»",

      "translated_text": "Falling into the Great Hell—**Avīci**—the **Uninterrupted Prison**, with no term for release. *Permanent* means *eternal*, *endless*. Through false slander of the True Dharma, the karmic roots are profound and heavy; thus, one falls into hell and finds it difficult to escape.\n\nFor **cognition** is singular. If perception is not upright, it becomes perverse. Humanity is singular; if one clings in delusion and fails to awaken, one becomes **foolish**, becomes **evil**. The heart is singular; if it gives rise to malevolent thoughts, it becomes **rebellious**. The eyes are singular; if they gaze askew, it becomes **transgression**. A single thought, though minute, is singular—if one harbors a single evil intention, it becomes the root of karmic cause. A single word, though few, is singular—if one utters a single evil speech, it becomes the origin of sin.\n\nThe **Noble One** perfects the singular virtue, praises others’ goodness, and those who uphold the scripture should be commended. Yet to falsely give rise to slander is to invite calamity upon oneself. Human life originally has no inherent karmic debt—one incurs guilt through self-inflicted transgression, and this is truly lamentable.\n\nWhen life is *exhausted*—for *exhausted* means *ended*—one returns to the cycle of transformation, bound by no fixed constraint. Yet even a single instance of slandering the Dharma casts one into the Great Hell, where death itself brings no peace. How then can one escape without end?\n\nHeaven’s heart is benevolent and loving; the **Supreme Sovereign** cherishes life, and the **Divine** is just, not drowning the people. Yet those who commit crimes with no hope of release—is this Heaven’s imprisonment? The calamity is self-made; fixed karma cannot be evaded. To eliminate one’s own karmic debt, one must rely on self-rectification. If one steadfastly pursues the utmost goodness, the karmic roots will be severed.\n\nAlas! The punishments of hell are Heaven’s retribution; the law is impartial—no father can shield his son, nor a filial child spare his parent. The Divine is utterly just; how could it erase self-inflicted karmic consequences?\n\nIf one takes refuge in the scripture and turns toward the Dharma, sincerely repents past transgressions—just as a worldly person who surrenders in truth may be spared their crime—then one may escape.\n\nIn this mortal life, the wise and foolish differ not in essence. If one cannot speak with measured words, let one’s voice conform to the **Laws**; yet do not utter falsehoods as **evil speech**. If one cannot act without fault, let one’s body be the **Measure**; yet do not commit **evil deeds** and incur bodily karmic debt. If one cannot keep the mind free from delusion, guarding the **Ultimate Truth**, then do not give rise to malevolent intentions and incur mental karmic debt.\n\nIf one does not know the **Great Dao**, do not slander the **Way**; if one does not understand the scripture, do not contradict it; if one cannot recite and uphold it, do not slander others; if one does not comprehend the **ghostly**, **life and death**, **cause and effect**, do not give rise to destructive speech. With a single mind of upright faith, one will gradually illuminate the **One Dao**, becoming a **Sage of Truth**—what karmic guilt could then remain?\n\n---\n**Verification Chapter (Continuation of the Fourteen Chapters)**\n\nAs for men and women in this world who encounter this scripture yet do not generate reverence, defiling it with unclean hands, reading aloud with a **polluted mouth**—one who has consumed the **Five Impurities** and **Five Spices**, or who places it upon an impure bed or seat—such treatment is utterly improper. Or if one recites this scripture while engaging in idle conversation, laughing and jesting as if it were a mundane text, treating it as a common classic—such a person, after death, falls into the **Uninterrupted Prison**, with no term for release. Their suffering extends to their **Nine Ancestors**, subjecting them to the **Tribunal of the Underworld**, entangling their descendants and harming future generations.\n\nIn hell, they endure unimaginable torments across countless **kalpas**. Even if they encounter sacred teachings and are repeatedly rescued, their sins diminish only slightly. If they then meet the **Supreme Sage’s special grace**, they may escape hell and be reborn as a **Hungry Ghost**, enduring for thousands of millions of **kalpas** without even hearing the name of **porridge**. Once their ghostly karmic debt is exhausted, they are reborn among **Animals**, and upon fulfilling that debt, if they are reborn as humans, they are cast into **barbaric lands**, reduced to **female form**, plagued by poverty, suffering, deformity, and countless diseases. They endure unbearable torments, despised by all, neither able to live nor die. This is the retribution for treating this scripture with contempt.\n\nThis is the **uttermost consequence of disrespecting the scripture**. To fail to generate reverence means to lack **respect, admiration, and veneration**. To defile it with unclean hands means to handle or point to the scripture with impure hands. To recite with a **polluted mouth** is to read while one’s mouth is tainted by the **Five Impurities** and **Five Spices**, or by the **Three Taboos**. To place it upon an impure bed or seat means to rest the scripture upon an unclean couch, table, or platform. Or to recite this scripture while speaking in **vulgar language**, laughing and jesting as if it were a trivial text—such a person not only incurs their own karmic retribution but also brings calamity upon their **Nine Ancestors**: the **First Ancestor**, the **Four昭 (Zhāo)**, and the **Four穆 (Mù)**.\n\nThey are subjected to the **Tribunal of the Underworld**—either **investigated for their transgressions** or **tortured**—as lesser spirits punish the household head for offenses. Their suffering extends to their descendants, entangling future generations. A family burdened with misdeeds faces additional calamity, enduring great torment and boundless affliction. Even if they encounter sacred teachings and are repeatedly rescued, their sins diminish only slightly—this is the merit of the scripture’s power reducing their guilt. If they then meet the **Supreme Sage’s special grace**, the **Divine’s pardon**, they may escape hell’s torments. As **Hungry Ghosts**, they suffer for thousands of millions of **kalpas**, their throats too narrow to swallow even the name of **porridge**. Once their ghostly karmic debt is exhausted, they are reborn among **Animals**, their karmic burden still unresolved.\n\nThough humanity is singular, one may struggle to be reborn in **China**, let alone as a **male**. Instead, they are cast into **barbaric lands**, reduced to **female form**—the least favored state among humans. They endure **poverty, cold, hunger, and hardship**, **deformity, disease, and endless suffering**, despised by all. They neither attain birth nor escape death, all because they treated this scripture with contempt. To incur such grave karmic guilt—how lamentable!\n\nHuman life is a participant in the **Three Powers of Heaven and Earth**, this body precious, relying on it to honor ancestors and benefit descendants, transmitting the **Dao** and sustaining what is entrusted—its weight is not slight. Yet to disrespect the scripture and the Dharma brings suffering upon oneself, entangles one’s ancestors, and dooms future generations. To endure such karmic retribution—how utterly foolish!",

When the mind and body are still and upright, the **Dragon and Tiger coil and spiral** (*lóng hǔ pán xuán*), giving rise to these three-colored clouds.\n\nIf one attains True Perfection, then **five-colored clouds** (*wǔ sè yún*) gather, and the **nine radiant glories** (*jiǔ xiá guāng*) spread forth—this is yet another state.\n\nSuddenly (*rú*), in the blink of an eye (*shǎo qīng shí*), one’s body shines **radiantly resplendent** (*guāng míng hè yì*), ascending to the **Celestial Palace** (*tiān gōng*), where the **multitudes of True Ones** descend to welcome.\n\n**Suddenly**, in a short while, one’s body **glows brilliantly** (*shēn guāng huàn fā*), **magnificent and luminous** (*shèng yào bǐng yì*). As previously explained.\n\nWhen the heart has a request, when the mind seeks entry into the **Celestial Palace**, all **supreme elixirs and wondrous treasures** (*yuánshǐ yùdì xiāndān miàobǎo*) are **offered in response**—whatever is desired is naturally obtained.\n\nOne must not merely **seek treasures**; the treasures are **offered to oneself**. One should **follow the prescribed methods** (*yī kē*), as previously explained.\n\nThe scripture is the **true nature of human essence** (*rén xìng zhēn*). Silent enlightenment and steadfast practice suffice.\n\nSpeaking of visualization, it seems to fall under the **second meaning** (*dì èr yì*). The Confucian classics say:\n*\"Faintly perceived, yet unseen—like a form without substance, yet clearly visible. It is as if one stands upon it.\"*\n\nIs this not also the **second meaning**?\n\nAlas, **enlightened sages are few**, while **mediocre minds prevail**. If one does not **grasp visualization**, how can one seek the **unheard teachings** (*bù wén zhī shì*) and thus **harmonize with Heaven and humanity**, transcend the mundane, and enter the sacred?\n\nLet scholars ponder this.\n\n---\n**Continuation of the *Yìngyàn Pǐn* (Verification Chapter), Thirty-Second Section**\n\nThis scripture is the path by which **three-world Golden Immortals** (*sān shì jīn xiān*) and **ten-direction Great Saints** (*shí fāng dà shèng*) attain the **supreme wondrous Dao**. The **Jade Emperor** of this scripture is the **teacher of all heavens** and the **king of all saints**.\n\nThis scripture is not merely for those who recite it with devotion—even **three-world Golden Immortals**, whether of the past, present, or future worlds, must follow its methods to attain the **supreme wondrous Dao**.\n\n**Golden Immortals** (*jīn xiān*) are those whose **Golden Elixirs do not decay** (*jīn dān bù huǐ*), the **true Daoists of the Great Mysterious** (*tài xuán zhēn xiān*). The **ten-direction Great Saints**—those of the **four cardinal, four diagonal, and upper-lower directions** (*sì zhèng fāng, sì yú fāng, shàng xià fāng*)—the **ten-direction numinous treasures and divine spirits** (*shí fāng língbǎo zūnshén*), the **Great Saints of Ultimate Truth and Boundless Extremes** (*zhì zhēn wújí dà shèng*)—all attain the **supreme wondrous Dao** by following its methods, as previously explained.\n\nProgress in cultivation varies, and attainments differ. Those whose **Dao-verification stages** (*zhèngdào jiē pǐn*) have not yet been reached do not yet possess the **supreme**.\n\nWhether **gods, humans, earthly, or ghostly immortals**; whether **desire-realm, form-realm, or formless heavenly deities**; whether **Bodhisattvas, Śrāvakas, Arhats, or Buddhist vehicles**; whether **transformed, great, beautiful, faithful, virtuous persons, or Confucian sages**—none of these are the **ultimate**.\n\nOnly **Celestial Immortals** (*tiān xiān*), **Wen Buddhas** (*wén fó*), and **unknowable Saints** (*bù zhī shèng*)—where **gods and Confucians** are named the **highest**—do the Golden Immortals and Great Saints, by **faithfully following this scripture**, merge with the **Imperial True Ones** (*dì zhēn*), thus attaining the **highest Immortal**, transcending and verifying the **supreme, ultimate, and wondrous Dao**, beyond the fruits of **heavenly blessings and virtues**.\n\nThis is the **Jade Emperor**. *Zhī* means *\"this.\"* He is the **teacher of all heavens**—the **thirty-three heavens**, the **thirty-six heavens**, the **twelve thousand heavens**, the **three thousand great worlds**, and **all heavens**—who **transform and give rise to the multitudes of True Ones** through the *Huáng Jīng* (Imperial Scripture).\n\nHe is the **king of all saints**—whether **immortals, Confucian sages, Buddhas, heavenly beings, or gods**—all **yield their virtues**, **surrender their merits**, and **acknowledge their supremacy**, revering him through the ages.\n\nAlas, if a person’s **Heavenly Sovereign** (*tiān jūn*) remains **serene and composed**, then the Dao may be attained. If one does not **cultivate the mind to enlightenment**, merging with Heaven in virtue, and **venerating the Supreme in emptiness**, one has **fallen short**. Be warned and reflect.\n\n---\n**Continuation of the *Yìngyàn Pǐn*, Thirty-Third Section**\n\nThus, when an **ordinary person** (*fán fú*) encounters this scripture and **devotes themselves with single-minded devotion**, even the **Five Emperors** (*wǔ dì*) will **assist and shelter**, summoning **multitudes of immortals**, commanding **divine officials**, directing **yin-yang forces**, earning the **respect of ten thousand spirits**, subduing **myriad gods**, keeping **a hundred evils at bay**, and binding **all demons** in form.\n\nAfter death, one will **enter the Southern Palace for refinement**, ascending the **Upper Clarity** (*shàng qīng*) with **free and easy steps**, dwelling in **adaptability and eternal Dao**.\n\nIt is not only **Golden Immortals and Great Sages** who verify the Dao through this scripture.\n\nThus, when an **ordinary person** (*shìjiān fán fú*) encounters this scripture through **karmic opportunity**, and **devotes themselves with precision and sincerity**, even the **Five Elder Emperors** (*wǔ lǎo dìshì*—not the Five Peaks) will **aid their cultivation** and **supplement their deficiencies**. They will **summon immortals** and **command divine officials**—**issuing orders to make them act**, as immortals respond to command, and **controlling them to serve**, as divine officials obey.\n\nThe scripture states:\n*\"Those who cultivate the Dao with devotion can even command ghosts and subdue gods.\"*\n\nEven an ordinary person, through **single-minded devotion to the scripture**, wielding the **power of Dao-law**, can **summon immortals and command gods**, directing **yin-yang forces**. Only through **precision and unity** can one **govern transformation** and **guide yin-yang**.\n\nThe **ten thousand spirits** will **reverently bow in awe**, and the **myriad gods** will **submit in fear and servitude**—without need for ritual. The **a hundred evils** will **avoid the path**, and the **multitudes of demons** will **restrain their forms**, daring not to reveal themselves.",
