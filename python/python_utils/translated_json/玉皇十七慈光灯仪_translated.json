contained the vast;\nAs the jade countenance gradually took form,\nThe brilliance of compassionate radiance shone resplendent.\nAbove, it illumines the Nine Heavens,\nEstablishing the realm of light and purity;\nBelow, it shines upon the Nine Earths,\nCausing the heavy and turbid to take shape.\nThe Three Luminaries thereby emit their splendor,\nAll things rely upon it for transformation and nurturance.\nThose bathed in its illumination,\nAll living beings attain fulfillment;\nThose graced by its brilliance,\nNo darkness remains unopened.\nThough forms are confined between heaven and

we are deeply ashamed;\nOffering our sincerity like an otter’s sacrifice, our merit is slight.\nOn this auspicious day,\nWe kindle and light the lamps,\nHumbly beseeching your non-interfering

completion,\nWe bare our sincere hearts,\nGazing afar toward the vermilion steps.\nThe seventeen lamps of compassionate radiance,\nEach is praised in song;\nWe gaze upon the countless ranks of attendants,\nTheir distant arrival fills us with awe.\n\nWe pray that our humble sincerity may ascend,\nAnd the heavenly radiance descend to illumine.\nMay its splendor grace our humble abodes,\nOpening auspicious light of fulfillment;\nMay its brilliance shine upon the clouded thoroughfares,\nBestowing extraordinary blessings.\nWith every prayer, may there be response;\nNo wish left unfulfilled.\nAll return to the perfection within,\nUniversally entering the realm of radiance.\nFollowing the lamps, we recite virtuous vows,\nWith reverent and sincere devotion.\n\nWe bow our heads

with devoted hearts take refuge,\nIn the Great Heavenly Worthy of Divine Transformative Radiance, the Jade Emperor,\nThe Heavenly Worthy, Sacred Father,\nThe Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother,\nAnd all the Perfected and Divine Officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard:\nThe Most August of the Golden Portal,\nEver holds a merciful heart;\nThe Jade Emperor,\nManifests his radiance through compassion.\nThose who receive its illumination,\nAll rely upon his pity and grace;\nThose who are nurtured by its influence,\nAll emerge beneath his sheltering canopy.\nHis loyalty and forgiveness are without flaw,\nHis magnanimity and tolerance boundless.\nTo express our private devotion,\nWe must rely on the rites of praise and exaltation.\n\nWe sincerely worship the Most High Great Luo Heaven,\nThe Great Heavenly Worthy of Divine Transformative Radiance, the Jade Emperor.\n\nReverently considering the Jade Emperor,\nWho emits his divine radiance,\nOpening the Three Luminaries,\nUniversally illuminating the ten directions.\nManifesting in fragrant adornment,\nHis sagely virtue shines resplendent.\nWithout peer, without equal,\nBeyond measure, beyond estimation.\n\nToday, your disciples\nHave established this orchid altar.\nKindling lamps and offering praise,\nWe ascend to reach the vault of heaven.\nMay you deign to look upon us,\nDispelling all inauspiciousness.\nExtending life and delivering from distress,\nGranting long enjoyment of peace and well-being.\nWith devoted hearts, we take refuge,\nPraying for peace and well-being.\n\nWe, your

are without flaw,\nHis magnanimity and tolerance boundless.\nTo express our private devotion,\nWe must rely on the rites of praise and exaltation.\n\nWe, the Dao-devoted, have long known gratitude yet found no means to repay our origins. Thus, we don the yellow crown, take refuge in the mysterious celestial patterns, and, in strict accordance with ritual law, reverently establish precious lamps to offer worship to the Great Compassionate Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the perfected spirits and true lords of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Emperor’s heart may broadly extend, that the heavenly Dao may favor reciprocity. May he release his compassion, that the light of vitality may brighten and revive the cosmos; may he dispel misfortune, that calamity may cease and auspiciousness arrive at our households. May the great turtle’s back stand firm, may the vast abode rest secure, our devoted hearts bowing in reverence as we join in praise.\n\nWe sincerely worship the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Compassionate Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.\n\nReverently considering the Jade Emperor: his light radiates compassion, ascending to connect with the celestial patterns, descending to encompass the earth’s bounds. His illumination reveals the hidden and the manifest, so that all, near and far, know to take refuge. He absolves transgressions and purges misfortune, sweeping away peril and danger. Today, we disciples reverently make our petition according to ritual, hoping for his gracious regard and the fulfillment of our prayers. May our bodies receive liberation, our hearts awaken to the subtle mysteries. May we dissolve worldly calamities and swiftly realize the effortless Way.\n\nWe, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in the Great Joyous Giving Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard that his treasuries of wealth and treasure, in days past, were generously bestowed; in times of famine, infirmity, and hardship, he responded with timely aid. Such joyous giving was never forced, for virtue stored within the inner chamber naturally radiates outward. Those touched by his kindness are as countless as the sands of the river; those bathed in his beneficence are not merely the multitudes of grasses and trees. Praise cannot exhaust him, nor can refuge ever be complete.\n\nWe, the Dao-devoted, dwell within the form of the great turtle’s back, tracing the footsteps of his vast compassion. Now, relying on the fragrance of cultivation, we offer this small token of reverence. Strictly following ritual law, we reverently establish precious lamps to offer worship to the Great Joyous Giving Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the perfected spirits and true lords of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe humbly pray that the August Emperor may bestow his favor upon the people below. May he grant abundant foundations, ensuring eternal peace across the ten thousand directions; may he spread auspicious gatherings, bringing lasting harmony to the four seasons. May the nine domains rejoice, may the three agricultural seasons yield omens of prosperity. With devoted hearts, we take refuge and sincerely proclaim his praise.\n\nWe sincerely worship the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Joyous Giving Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.\n\nReverently considering the Jade Emperor: his blessings and benefits are boundless.

With one heart, we take refuge, praying for longevity.\n\nWe, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in the Great Forbearance Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard that the heavenly Dao does not contend, yet it is ever said that goodness prevails; the Emperor’s virtue broadly extends, nurturing life with harmony. His nature is rooted in gentle compassion, thus his light radiates forbearance. Stillness can restrain motion, softness can overcome hardness. His magnanimity allows for tolerance, and thus he remains unshamed. How profound his weightiness, how true his compassionate heart! If people can embody this, they align with heaven.\n\nWe, the Dao-devoted, endowed with lowly forms and dwelling in the central realm, have long been sheltered by his grace. Yet we still seek to repay his kindness. Strictly following ritual law, we reverently establish precious lamps to offer worship to the Great Forbearance Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the perfected spirits and true lords of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe humbly pray that the heavenly heart may not abandon us, ever embracing tolerance. May his generous spirit expand, broadening the foundations of fortune; may his compassionate heart deepen, elevating virtuous deeds ever higher. May his virtue renew daily, may his affairs align with his will. With reverence, we bow our heads and sincerely proclaim his praise.\n\nWe sincerely worship the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Forbearance Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.\n\nReverently considering the Jade Emperor: his forbearance radiates light, his compassion pervades the dusty world, his transformation reaches distant lands. He sets aside strength and employs softness, using gentleness to overcome hardness. How vast his magnanimity—beyond all measure!\n\nToday, we disciples lift our gaze to the vault of heaven. Blessings flow from his grace, boundless fortune arrives. May from this auspicious day forward, misfortune be dispelled. May we forever take refuge beneath his compassionate shelter, eternally welcoming good fortune.\n\nWe, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in the Great Impartial Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard that he weighs the three realms, his position exalted in the mysterious vault; he mirrors the ten directions, his light thus impartial. He reveals that the heavenly principle is fundamentally without distinction, guiding human hearts to be free of bias. Those who grasp his intent naturally abandon partiality toward high or low; those who penetrate his subtlety all enter the Way of great impartiality and perfect rectitude.\n\nThis day, we, [name], reflecting upon the virtue and grace received, find repayment ever beyond reach. Reverently following the ritual statutes, we establish precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Impartial Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the true numina and sovereign spirits of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe humbly pray that the celestial light may shine down, and the imperial decree be generously bestowed. May virtue spread to all living beings, each preserving the firmness of their life-root; may merit aid the world, all encountering the flourishing of the times. Gathered in the same assembly as wind and clouds, may all equally partake of rain and dew. With devoted hearts we take refuge, reverently extolling:\n\nWe sincerely venerate the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Impartial Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.\n\nWe revere the Jade Emperor, whose great impartial light is vast and boundless, resplendent and radiant. It encompasses heaven and earth, yet enters the finest detail. The mysterious vault bestows its grace, and the dharma-realm manifests auspiciousness. Today, your disciples, gazing afar toward the divine realm, pour forth sincerity and faith, earnestly beseeching the heavens. May you bestow blessings and favor, dispelling calamities and misfortunes. May the myriad spirits receive felicity, and may we forever preserve peace and well-being.\n\nWe, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in the Great Gentle Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard: the Supreme Lord is uniquely exalted, how could he be solitary in his supremacy? The supreme Dao is unrivaled, yet only through gentleness can strength be overcome. From his pure and tranquil dharmakāya, he universally manifests the luminous form of gentle radiance. Those who grasp its subtlety attain perfect harmony and refined elegance; those who receive its illumination find their hearts filled with kindness and auspiciousness. Resplendent to this day, radiant since antiquity.\n\nWe, your disciples who follow the Dao, born under its shelter, now freely wander in accord with our nature. Reflecting upon the establishment of modest merit, we reverently repay great virtue. Diligently adhering to the ritual statutes, we honor and establish precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Gentle Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the true numina and sovereign spirits of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe humbly pray that the celestial heart may be clearly moved, and the imperial mind show compassion. May vast grace be showered forth, universally inspiring the transformation of peace and harmony; may its blessed moisture be bestowed, fully preserving the lives of all beings. Extending to both the manifest and the hidden, may all equally receive benefit and joy. With pure and sincere intent, we reverently proclaim:\n\nWe sincerely venerate the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Gentle Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.\n\nWe revere the Jade Emperor, whose light radiates gentleness. It illumines with clarity, penetrating all without exception. It harmonizes and pacifies heaven and earth, gently subduing demons and evil.

Today, your disciples, stretching their necks toward the vast heavens, pray for the peace of their lands and the eternal cessation of warfare. May you graciously turn your gaze, ending suffering and plague. May the times be pure and the Dao prosperous, and may songs of praise be heard once more.\n\nWith utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves before the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Supreme Freedom, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard: When the Emperor’s majesty descends, his position is exalted in the realm of perfect clarity; the Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet its radiance naturally manifests in boundless freedom. Whether to proceed or to pause, to act or to rest—all follows the currents of purity and turbidity, sinking or floating as they may. With purpose and action, yet unobstructed and unfettered, one who grasps this mechanism finds nothing beyond reach; one who comprehends its function discovers all barriers dissolved. Spontaneous and self-so, it is present everywhere without exception.\n\nWe, humble servants of the Dao, though dull of understanding, have been graced by the Emperor’s benevolence. Thus, we humbly perform the Lamp Rite, offering this modest token of devotion. Following the prescribed rituals, we establish the precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Supreme Freedom, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe reverently pray that the Dao of emptiness and non-being may extend, casting forth the light of boundless freedom.

May the four seasons be harmonious and tranquil, and all calamities be dispelled.\n\nWith utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves before the Great Beneficent Radiant Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard: As the Teacher of the Three Realms, he compassionately contemplates all beings and awakens the mind of skillful means; as the Compassionate Father of the Four Kinds of Birth, he illumines the dharma-realm and opens the gate of benefit. When his auspicious light shines forth, even the sun and moon pause in their course; when his power of grace is bestowed, it serves as a bridge to the other shore. All who dwell beneath the celestial radiance equally receive the blessings of his benevolence. His sacred virtue is resplendent, his grace vast and boundless.\n\nWe, humble servants of the Dao, have long dwelled within the sacred realm, bathed in the Emperor’s radiance. Without the illumination of these lamps, how could we express our gratitude for these fundamental blessings? Following the prescribed rituals, we reverently establish the precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Beneficent Radiant Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe reverently pray that his compassionate light may thoroughly illumine and his sacred perception clearly descend.

Today, your disciples, lifting their gaze toward the realm of perfect clarity, kindle lamps and cultivate virtue, presenting their sincere devotion. We humbly pray for your gracious regard, that you may bestow longevity and bless our years. May disasters be dispelled and calamities averted, ensuring eternal security.\n\nWith utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves before the Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiant Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard: The vast heavens are unerring, for their inner realm is harmonious and luminous; the August Emperor is sovereign, for his heart is thoroughly penetrating. His profound perception casts an impartial light, and his radiant splendor shines forth as the light of wish-fulfillment. Those who receive his illumination find no desire unanswered; those who are bathed in his brilliance discover all prayers fulfilled. Everywhere, all hearts find their aspirations met, and every person attains their heart’s desire. His sacred virtue is unfathomable, and the people’s hearts know only reverence.\n\nWe, humble servants of the Dao, moved by the profound transformation, seek to exhaust our sincerity.

Before heaven and before earth, without beginning or end, his wish-fulfilling light shines forth, and his position is exalted in the highest heavens. All prayers are answered, and no wish remains unfulfilled. Today, your disciples, gazing afar toward the Jade Palace, kindle lamps in offering, presenting their earnest and reverent devotion. We humbly pray for your clear perception, that you may look down upon our humble sincerity. May you prolong our years and increase our vitality, dispelling disasters and calamities.\n\nWith utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves before the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Great Wisdom, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard: His wisdom perceives the subtle and obscure, as luminous as the celestial mirror; his insight penetrates the mysterious and wondrous, for what could be hidden from the Emperor’s heart? The light of wisdom shines upon distant lands, and the power of grace radiates throughout the mortal realm. When one awakens to the subtle truth, the nature of heaven becomes clear; when one grasps its principle, the heart-ground becomes luminous. The foolish may become wise, and the obstinate may be transformed.\n\nWe, your disciples, though confined within limited bounds, have long been bathed in the universal illumination.

He presides over the three realms and governs the myriad spirits. His subtle radiance dissolves the self-entanglements of suffering, and his numinous brilliance releases the self-imposed bonds of delusion.

May he release his compassion, that the light of vitality may brighten and revive the cosmos; may he dispel misfortune, that calamity may cease and auspiciousness arrive at our households. May the great turtle’s back stand firm, may the vast abode rest secure, our devoted hearts bowing in reverence as we join in praise.\n\nWe sincerely worship the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Compassionate Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.\n\nReverently considering the Jade Emperor: his light radiates compassion, ascending to connect with the celestial patterns, descending to encompass the earth’s bounds. His illumination reveals the hidden and the manifest, so that all, near and far, know to take refuge. He absolves transgressions and purges misfortune, sweeping away peril and danger. Today, we disciples reverently make our petition according to ritual, hoping for his gracious regard and the fulfillment of our prayers. May our bodies receive liberation, our hearts awaken to the subtle mysteries. May we dissolve worldly calamities and swiftly realize the effortless Way.\n\nWe, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in the Great Joyous Giving Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard that his treasuries of wealth and treasure, in days past, were generously bestowed; in times of famine, infirmity, and hardship, he responded with timely aid. Such joyous giving was never forced, for virtue stored within the inner chamber naturally radiates outward. Those touched by his kindness are as countless as the sands of the river; those bathed in his beneficence are not merely the multitudes of grasses and trees. Praise cannot exhaust him, nor can refuge ever be complete.\n\nWe, the Dao-devoted, dwell within the form of the great turtle’s back, tracing the footsteps of his vast compassion.

Today, we disciples wholeheartedly offer our devotion, kindling lamps in prayer and praise to protect and prolong the nation. May the Dao’s qi flow forth, awakening us to the true mystery. May all receive liberation, may disasters and transgressions be swept away. With one heart, we take refuge, praying for longevity.\n\nWe, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in the Great Forbearance Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard that the heavenly Dao does not contend, yet it is ever said that goodness prevails; the Emperor’s virtue broadly extends, nurturing life with harmony. His nature is rooted in gentle compassion, thus his light radiates forbearance. Stillness can restrain motion, softness can overcome hardness. His magnanimity allows for tolerance, and thus he remains unshamed. How profound his weightiness, how true his compassionate heart! If people can embody this, they align with heaven.\n\nWe, the Dao-devoted, endowed with lowly forms and dwelling in the central realm, have long been sheltered by his grace. Yet we still seek to repay his kindness. Strictly following ritual law, we reverently establish precious lamps to offer worship to the Great Forbearance Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the perfected spirits and true lords of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe humbly pray that the heavenly heart may not abandon us, ever embracing tolerance. May his generous spirit expand, broadening the foundations of fortune; may his compassionate heart deepen, elevating virtuous deeds ever higher. May his virtue renew daily, may his affairs align with his will. With reverence, we bow our heads and sincerely proclaim his praise.\n\nWe sincerely worship the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Forbearance Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.\n\nReverently considering the Jade Emperor: his forbearance radiates light, his compassion pervades the dusty world, his transformation reaches distant lands. He sets aside strength and employs softness, using gentleness to overcome hardness. How vast his magnanimity—beyond all measure!\n\nToday, we disciples lift our gaze to the vault of heaven. Blessings flow from his grace, boundless fortune arrives. May from this auspicious day forward, misfortune be dispelled. May we forever take refuge beneath his compassionate shelter, eternally welcoming good fortune.\n\nWe, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in the Great Impartial Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard that he weighs the three realms, his position exalted in the mysterious vault; he mirrors the ten directions, his light thus impartial. He reveals that the heavenly principle is fundamentally without distinction, guiding human hearts to be free of bias. Those who grasp his intent naturally abandon partiality toward high or low; those who penetrate his subtlety all enter the Way of great impartiality and perfect rectitude.",

Whether to proceed or to pause, to act or to rest—all follows the currents of purity and turbidity, sinking or floating as they may. With purpose and action, yet unobstructed and unfettered, one who grasps this mechanism finds nothing beyond reach; one who comprehends its function discovers all barriers dissolved. Spontaneous and self-so, it is present everywhere without exception.\n\nWe, humble servants of the Dao, though dull of understanding, have been graced by the Emperor’s benevolence. Thus, we humbly perform the Lamp Rite, offering this modest token of devotion. Following the prescribed rituals, we establish the precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Supreme Freedom, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe reverently pray that the Dao of emptiness and non-being may extend, casting forth the light of boundless freedom. May it safeguard the nation and bring peace to households, ensuring the Yellow River runs clear and the seas remain calm; may it prolong life and increase vitality, fostering abundance for all beings and well-being for the people. May we witness the age of peace and personally encounter the reign of great harmony.\n\nWith utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves and join in praise.\n\nWe sincerely venerate the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Supreme Freedom, Heavenly Worthy.\n\nWe revere the Jade Emperor, whose position is central to the celestial pivot. Free in coming and going, his transformations are unhindered. His radiance illumines the heavens, his brilliance shines upon the celestial thoroughfares. He bestows blessings upon the upper realms and confers grace upon the mortal world. Today, your disciples, with sincere and earnest hearts, extend their reverence, humbly inviting your divine presence to descend into our humble abode. We pray for your gracious regard, that disasters and misfortunes may cease. May the four seasons be harmonious and tranquil, and all calamities be dispelled.\n\nWith utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves before the Great Beneficent Radiant Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard: As the Teacher of the Three Realms, he compassionately contemplates all beings and awakens the mind of skillful means; as the Compassionate Father of the Four Kinds of Birth, he illumines the dharma-realm and opens the gate of benefit. When his auspicious light shines forth, even the sun and moon pause in their course; when his power of grace is bestowed, it serves as a bridge to the other shore. All who dwell beneath the celestial radiance equally receive the blessings of his benevolence. His sacred virtue is resplendent, his grace vast and boundless.\n\nWe, humble servants of the Dao, have long dwelled within the sacred realm, bathed in the Emperor’s radiance. Without the illumination of these lamps, how could we express our gratitude for these fundamental blessings? Following the prescribed rituals, we reverently establish the precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Beneficent Radiant Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe reverently pray that his compassionate light may thoroughly illumine and his sacred perception clearly descend. May our bodies transcend a thousand calamities, and may wealth and longevity be eternally bestowed; may our lives be prolonged with a hundred blessings, and may our radiance precede us in times of great peace. May no future hardships arise, and may we forever dwell in abundant fortune.\n\nWith devotion and faith, we prostrate ourselves and humbly offer praise.\n\nWe sincerely venerate the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Beneficent Radiant Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.\n\nWe revere the Jade Emperor, the Lord of Infinite Kalpas.

From ancient times to the present, his reliability is unwavering, and his blessings extend equally to the great and the small. Today, your disciples, lifting their gaze toward the realm of perfect clarity, kindle lamps and cultivate virtue, presenting their sincere devotion. We humbly pray for your gracious regard, that you may bestow longevity and bless our years. May disasters be dispelled and calamities averted, ensuring eternal security.\n\nWith utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves before the Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiant Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard: The vast heavens are unerring, for their inner realm is harmonious and luminous; the August Emperor is sovereign, for his heart is thoroughly penetrating. His profound perception casts an impartial light, and his radiant splendor shines forth as the light of wish-fulfillment. Those who receive his illumination find no desire unanswered; those who are bathed in his brilliance discover all prayers fulfilled. Everywhere, all hearts find their aspirations met, and every person attains their heart’s desire. His sacred virtue is unfathomable, and the people’s hearts know only reverence.\n\nWe, humble servants of the Dao, moved by the profound transformation, seek to exhaust our sincerity. Relying upon this modest cause, we reverently repay the great blessings. Following the prescribed rituals, we establish the precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiant Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe reverently pray that the Emperor’s majesty may descend in glory, and that the celestial hearing may not overlook our pleas. May virtuous fruits come to perfect fulfillment—our plans as we wish, our affairs as we desire; may the sprouts of our spiritual cultivation remain unharmed—may we grow old in wisdom, live long in prosperity. May we delight in the covenant of the gulls and rejoice beneath the vast shelter of the wild geese.\n\nWith devotion and faith, we prostrate ourselves and humbly offer praise.\n\nWe sincerely venerate the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiant Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.\n\nWe revere the Jade Emperor, who embodies the Dao within the primordial chaos. Before heaven and before earth, without beginning or end, his wish-fulfilling light shines forth, and his position is exalted in the highest heavens. All prayers are answered, and no wish remains unfulfilled. Today, your disciples, gazing afar toward the Jade Palace, kindle lamps in offering, presenting their earnest and reverent devotion. We humbly pray for your clear perception, that you may look down upon our humble sincerity. May you prolong our years and increase our vitality, dispelling disasters and calamities.\n\nWith utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves before the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Great Wisdom, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard: His wisdom perceives the subtle and obscure, as luminous as the celestial mirror; his insight penetrates the mysterious and wondrous, for what could be hidden from the Emperor’s heart? The light of wisdom shines upon distant lands, and the power of grace radiates throughout the mortal realm. When one awakens to the subtle truth, the nature of heaven becomes clear; when one grasps its principle, the heart-ground becomes luminous. The foolish may become wise, and the obstinate may be transformed.\n\nWe, your disciples, though confined within limited bounds, have long been bathed in the universal illumination. Desiring to express our reverence, we rely upon this offering of praise. Following the prescribed rituals, we reverently establish the precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Great Wisdom, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.",

May the primordial luminaries guard us together, and may the sacred eyes shine as one.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the Great Liberation Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard that pure liberation manifests its light in the One Reality; sacred wisdom is perfectly all-pervading, encompassing the four great elements. He presides over the three realms and governs the myriad spirits. His subtle radiance dissolves the self-entanglements of suffering, and his numinous brilliance releases the self-imposed bonds of delusion. His celestial light shines afar, and his sacred grace extends widely, so that all beings and creatures receive the illumination of his compassion.\n\nToday, we who have been shaped by the great transformation and received our mandate from the Supreme Mystery return our thoughts to the truth, repaying kindness and fulfilling virtue. Following the prescribed rituals, we reverently establish the precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Liberation Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe humbly pray that the celestial heart may be pleased, and the imperial will grant our petition. May extraordinary auspicious signs increase daily, nurturing the people forever; may vast protection be added like clouds, safeguarding the faithful without worry. May great harmony prevail eternally, and hidden maladies be silently dispelled. With devoted hearts, we bow our heads and together offer this praise.\n\nWe sincerely worship the Supreme Great Luo Heaven and the Great Liberation Radiance Jade Emperor.\n\nWe revere the Jade Emperor, whose liberation radiance shines brilliantly, illuminating the jade universe and shining upon the golden courts. Both the hidden and the manifest rely upon him, and from ancient times to the present, all have followed his guidance. All beings attain their desires, and no wish remains unfulfilled.\n\nToday, your disciples, who love the Dao and seek the numinous, unfold the scriptures and practice their original conduct, offering lamps to the immortals and perfected ones. Earnestly and sincerely, we seek deliverance. We pray that misfortune may be dispelled, and that primordial harmony may prevail.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the Great Refuge Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard that those who turn their hearts to the realm of the Dao engage in cultivation for over three thousand kalpas; those who follow the traces of the Mystery Gate receive the universal illumination of the seventeen rays of compassion. With benevolent hearts set upon salvation, the light manifests as refuge. Those who awaken enter the gate of being; those who comprehend find the path of seeking. The wondrous and profound essence, the resplendent light of compassion, the illustrious virtue, and the unfathomable numinous mechanism—all these we revere.\n\nWe, your disciples who follow the Dao, have long felt gratitude and never cease to contemplate the Dao. With utmost sincerity, we offer our humble devotion, reverently establishing the precious lamps in accordance with the rituals, making offerings to the Great Refuge Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina.\n\nWe humbly pray that though no words are spoken, responses arise from sincerity. May the Emperor’s virtue illumine the heavens, pacifying the five luminaries and bringing forth compliance; may the Dao’s influence spread afar, nurturing all things to flourish. May the roots of suffering be dissolved, and the calamities of the kalpas be pacified. With faith and devotion, we reverently proclaim this offering.\n\nWe sincerely worship the Supreme Great Luo Heaven and the Great Refuge Radiance Jade Emperor.\n\nWe revere the Jade Emperor, who once dwelled in the Pure Mystery. With a heart set upon salvation, his light radiated as refuge. He illumined the myriad wonders, awakening the deluded multitudes. All beings, without exception, harmonized with non-action.\n\nToday, your disciples gaze afar toward the cinnabar steps. The lamp’s radiance shines brightly, and the faithful receive blessings. The five stars follow their courses, shining brilliantly; the myriad people enjoy peace, and all fortunes are fitting. May the primordial luminaries protect us together, and may the sacred eyes shine as one.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the Great Merit Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\n\nWe have heard that to forget merit is true merit, and Heaven’s merit does not claim dominion...",
