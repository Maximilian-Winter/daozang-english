  "full_translation": "**The Scripture of the Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls and the Nine Elixirs of Divine Immortals**\n\n**Title:** *The Scripture of the Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls and the Nine Elixirs of Divine Immortals*\nOriginally attributed to the Perfected One of Great Clarity, likely a fabrication by Daoist practitioners of the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. The early Tang *Treatise on Daoist Canons* (vol. 4) already cites this text, and its content closely resembles the nine-cycle elixir formulas recorded in the first volume of *The Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons’ Divine Elixirs*. *The Comprehensive Records·Bibliographic Treatise* lists this work in three volumes, though only two survive today.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Divine Arts*, *Category of Various Techniques*\n\n---\n\n### *The Scripture of the Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls and the Nine Elixirs of Divine Immortals, Volume One*\n**As Told by the Perfected One of Great Clarity**\n\n[Beginning missing]\n\nCinnabar is produced in many commanderies and counties, hence the saying that marriages are numerous. The Daoist observes the precepts and travels to the Five Capitals. The Five Capitals refer to the Five Sacred Peaks, where the divine medicine is to be concocted. The \"four thousand sons\" denote the purchase of mercury. \"Gold and silver added\" refers to the combination of lead and mercury, hence the phrase. \"Ziming cooks for his wife by the red furnace\" describes mercury and dark yellow (lead oxide) being mixed in an earthen cauldron. The \"red furnace\" is the name for the earthen cauldron. Mercury is the cauldron. The phrase \"mercury and lead combine, enraged and desiring to fly red\" refers to their fusion, hence the mention of \"mouth and teeth.\" \"Using mouth and teeth like abundant true yellow\" describes the transformation of lead and mercury into dark yellow. \"Steamed and covered in a soft bamboo basket like a bat\" refers to the sublimated essence of dark yellow, which must be steamed a hundred times. Hence the saying, \"steamed and covered at the head of the soft bamboo basket.\" \"The center like a softened bamboo basket\" refers to a fresh bamboo basket.\n\n\"Ziming trembles in fear, harboring the River Chariot within.\" Ziming is mercury, which, when heated, flees into lead. Lead is also called the River Chariot, hence the phrase \"harboring the River.\" \"Neighbors—realgar and cinnabar—reconcile and bid farewell to the household.\" This means that the sublimated essence should be mixed with realgar water and cinnabar water, hence the phrase \"bidding farewell to the household.\" \"Oyster shell and red halloysite ensure no deviation.\" The two earthen cauldrons should be sealed inside and out with a mixture of oyster shell and red halloysite, each layer three *fen* thick. \"Ensure no deviation\" means preventing the divine medicine and sublimated essences from escaping, hence the phrase.\n\nIt is said: Take twenty *jin* of oyster shell, mix it with red halloysite, grind them into powder, and blend with a hundred days’ fermentation to form a paste. Coat the inside and outside of the earthen cauldrons with this mixture, each layer three *fen* thick. Seal and let dry in the shade for ten days. Then sublime the mercury and dark yellow together, heating them nine times above and nine times below, until they turn the color of frost and purple, resembling onion blossoms. Only then will the two natures harmonize. \"The two natures harmonize\" means the medicine dares not flee and unites with the dark yellow, hence the phrase.\n\n\"At dusk, the bowels stir in responsive resonance\" describes the union of the two medicines, hence the phrase. \"Husband and wife play together, their colors suddenly blossoming; yin and yang meet, their joy unbounded.\" \"Joy unbounded\" signifies the completion of the divine medicine, bringing great delight to the household, hence the phrase. \"On the same day, a child is born like piled sand\" describes mercury and dark yellow sublimating together and adhering to the upper earthen cauldron like piled sand.\n\n\"The bronze feather and the next medicine, the earth dragon harmonized\": The \"bronze feather\" refers to the feathers of a three-year-old rooster, used to sweep the medicine and gather the sublimated essence. \"The earth dragon harmonized\" means mixing the elixir’s blossom with the juice of a white-necked earthworm and sublimating it again, hence the phrase. \"Capable of transmuting into gold and silver\" means that a *daorui* of elixir powder, combined with a *jin* of lead and mercury, will instantly become yellow gold when placed over a fierce fire, hence the phrase.\n\n\"Water is the yellow tooth.\" \"One *jin* with one *zhu*\" means taking one *zhu* of the nine-times-sublimated elixir blossom and powdering it with one *jin* of mercury—or one *jin* of lead or tin—will transmute them all into yellow gold. Hence the warning: \"One *jin* with one *zhu*, be cautious not to exceed.\" Excess makes the gold too hard for forging; deficiency makes it too soft. Hence the warning.\n\n\"Eating like millet and millet flying past one another\" means ascending to heaven. \"Sitting, one knows heaven and earth\" describes how, upon ingesting the elixir blossom, one instantly ascends and beholds all the gods above. \"Gazing afar at others\" means one’s eyes become so bright they can see ten thousand *li*, hence the phrase. \"Suddenly crossing ten thousand *li* of rivers and streams\" describes how, after ingesting the elixir blossom for a day and night, one may instantly fly ten thousand *li*, unrestrained by rivers and streams, traveling without boats or bridges, riding the clouds and *qi*, hence the phrase.\n\n\"Using dragons as horses and purchasing scholars as chariots\" describes soaring into the azure clouds to follow the Perfected One of Grand Unity. \"At times entering the celestial gate to meet the great host\" means ascending to heaven to see the abodes of the Perfected Ones above, hence the phrase. \"One’s body rivals the sun and moon—wherever one desires to be\": Ingesting the elixir blossom grants immortality, one’s body shining with the same light as the sun and moon. One’s heart’s desires are unrestrained, unbound by heaven and earth or the laws of kings, hence the phrase.\n\n\"Why behold all the worthies and sages arrayed before one?\" describes meeting the Perfected Ones, the Grand Unity, and all the divine immortals, sitting in mutual company, hence the phrase. \"The divine turtle, the paired geese, the divine shrimp at dusk\": Even the celestial divine turtles and shrimps attain immortality. \"Bo Ya plays the zither, jade maidens sing in unison, and green-waisted dancers rise in sorrowful harmony.\" \"Sorrowful harmony\" refers to the Perfected One of Grand Unity leading the revelry with wine.\n\n\"I grieve for my parents’ early death, for they knew not the Dao. Alone, I am vexed and aggrieved—what can be done? My parents and kin have all perished too soon, their pain unrelieved by the medicine.\"\n\nThus the body ingests the divine elixir of flowering cinnabar, and no perverse qi can harm it, nor can illness befall it. To say that consuming the flowering cinnabar cures all ailments is to declare that no sickness will afflict one.\n\nFortunate is the one who attains transcendence—auspicious and without misfortune. \"Auspicious and without misfortune\" means the body endures for ten thousand generations, following the Perfected Ones. Fortunate is the one who transcends the world for ten thousand years and more. If you diligently study this, you too may attain immortality.\n\nExplanation: The method for refining the flowering cinnabar elixir involves taking alum, halite, bittern, and arsenolite—four substances—and first firing them for twenty days. Then, take leftward-turning oysters from the Eastern Sea, red stone, talc, and seven other ingredients, adjusting their quantities as needed. Pound them ten thousand times until they become powder, then place them in an iron vessel and fire them for nine days and nine nights, intensifying the flame until the medicine glows red as fire. Pound it again ten thousand times, sift it through fresh silk, and blend it with well-fermented hundred-day wine to create the \"Six-One Mud.\" Coat the inside and outside of two red clay crucibles with this mud, each layer three fen thick, and dry them in the sun for over ten days until thoroughly desiccated. Then, take lead powder and fire it until it turns golden. Next, take equal parts of dark yellow and yellow substances, mix them with hundred-day Hua Pond liquid to form a paste, pound them ten thousand times, and coat the inside of the two red clay crucibles with a three-fen-thick layer. Apply another three-fen-thick layer to the outside and dry them in the sun for ten days until completely dry.\n\nThen, place two jin of cinnabar into the crucible, adjusting the quantity of medicine as needed—from one jin at the base to ten jin at the top, or even a hundred jin, with no fixed amount. The poor may prepare less, the wealthy more. A crucible large enough to hold eight or nine sheng can accommodate one and a half dou. Those from Rongyang, Henan, Luoyang, and Yingchuan command high prices, with each crucible costing fourteen or fifteen coins. First, coat the crucibles inside and out with Six-One Mud, each layer three fen thick, and dry them in the sun for ten days until thoroughly desiccated before use.\n\nPlace the cinnabar into the crucible and seal it, allowing it to dry for over ten days. Ensure the crucible’s mouth and seams are tightly sealed to prevent any leakage. Before the cinnabar ascends, first heat the crucible with horse dung fire, piling earth around the crucible’s edges with the fire five cun away. \"Tongqing\" refers to horse dung; if unavailable, use chaff fire. Heat it for nine days and nine nights, then push the fire closer for another nine days and nine nights, placing the crucible directly over the flame. For the next nine days and nine nights, mound the fire halfway up the crucible. After a total of thirty-six days of firing, it will be ready. Let it cool for a day, then open it—the cinnabar will have ascended and adhered to the upper crucible. Sweep it off with a rooster’s feather: it will appear purple-red, shimmering with five colors, sometimes like streaking stars or swirling red, other times like frost or snow, or pure red as cinnabar. One jin of this substance yields only four liang.\n\nIf the medicine resists the fire and does not rise, it is called \"flowering cinnabar.\" Blend it with dragon fat, form pellets the size of small beans, and place them over a fierce fire. With bellows, blow on them for the time it takes to cook a meal, and they will turn into gold. If the medicine does not ascend and instead becomes powdered mercury, fire one jin of it with twenty-four zhu, and it too will become gold. Use this to fashion gold and silver plates to hold the medicine. To ingest it, take a pellet the size of a small bean, face the sun, bow twice, and consume it. If the medicine does not submit to the fire, refine it again. Mix it with dark water, dragon fat, and moisture until damp, then place it back into the dark yellow and red clay crucible, seal it properly, and fiercely fire it for another thirty-six days until the medicine is complete. In total, seventy-two days will suffice.\n\nWhen preparing the medicine, begin on an auspicious day such as the first day of the sexagenary cycle, the day of the \"Opening\" or \"Removal\" in the almanac. Before compounding the medicine, fast and purify yourself for three days. No more than two or three people should participate, and they must be of one mind, for \"two in harmony can cut through metal.\" Focus your intent and avoid entering defiled or impure households. When firing the medicine, perform a ritual offering at the crucible’s edge with clear wine, fragrant cakes, a dou of millet, three dou of jujubes, and a dou of pears. Arrange three tables, each with three cups, and as the incense rises, bow twice and pray:\n\n\"Lesser servant so-and-so, on this day, refines the Nine Elixirs. May the divine immortals, the Mysterious Woman, the Plain Woman, and the Green-Waisted Jade Maidens assist in its completion. May the Lord of the Great Dao, Lord Lao, and the Lord of Grand Harmony grant this lesser servant so-and-so the medicine of immortality and the wine of the divine immortals.\"\n\nRise, bow twice, and complete nine bows. Then recite:\n\n\"May the Lord of the Dao and the Mysterious Woman ensure the medicine does not flee, that it submits to the fire, and that its color is fine and good. May it transform at will, yielding both yellow and white. May those who consume it ascend to the Purple Palace, their lives boundless, their rank that of a Perfected One.\"\n\nThen offer the wine. After the wine is presented, offer all manner of red fruits and citrus fruits. When preparing the divine medicine, do not allow fools, women, children, mourners, the impure, or those with sharp tongues and envious hearts to witness it. If they do not follow the Dao, do not let them know of it, lest the medicine fail to form. Take care that no guests or women linger near the medicine. Why? The medicine requires absolute silence to succeed. Fools who doubt the Dao and deny the existence of divine medicines must not see it, or the medicine will not form.\n\nCarefully monitor the crucible to ensure no cracks, holes, or damage—even as small as a hair or an ant’s nose—lest the medicine escape, its spirit vanish, its soul dissipate, leaving only stone behind and squandering its precious essence. The medicine will then be ineffective and offer no benefit to those who consume it. One zhu of the divine medicine, when cast into a jin of mercury and fired, will turn it into gold. If it does not become gold, the medicine is unfit for consumption.\n\nThus the Mysterious Woman said: \"If gold can be made, the world can be transcended. If gold cannot be made, one only harms oneself.\"\n\nThen take one *zhu* of the elixir and grind it with one *jin* each of lead, tin, and mercury—all will transform into gold and silver. Thus it is said: \"A *jin* for a *jin*, and one *zhu*—take care not to exceed this measure.\" Always at dawn, when the sun rises, face east, bow twice, kneel, and ingest it like grain. The superior adept who consumes it will ascend as an immortal among the Nine Sovereigns in seven days. The lesser adept will attain immortality in seventy days. The foolish who take it will achieve it only after a year.\n\nWhen preparing the divine medicine and consuming it, one must first purify through fasting, bathing in five fragrant herbs, and observing the proper rites—without these, the medicine will not form. To refine the elixir in a cinnabar crucible with divine talismans is most excellent. Do not covet wealth; only by refining the divine medicine can one attain immortality. Do not transmit this recklessly.\n\nThe Perfected One said: The second elixir is called the Divine Talisman, born of the surplus of the Great Yang and the River Earl. \"Born of the Great Yang\" refers to mercury, which originates from the Great Yang. The Great Yang is cinnabar, born in *bing* and *ding*. *Bing* and *ding* are the essence of fire, ascending as the Star of Blazing Delusion and descending as cinnabar. Thus it is said to be born in *bing* and *ding*. *Bing* and *ding* reside in the south, the direction of the Great Yang. Therefore, the *Yi* speaks of the \"empty sun\" in the south as the Great Yang. The Great Yang is cinnabar, born of the sun, and the sun is born of fire—fire is the child of the sun.\n\nThe north, *ren* and *gui*, is the Great Yin, and the Great Yin is water. Thus the *Yi* speaks of the \"empty moon\" in the north, where lodestone is born. Lodestone is lead. Its essence ascends as the North Star, born in *kan*. *Kan* resides in the north, while *li* resides in the south. The \"surplus of the River Earl\" is mercury.\n\nTake an unrestricted measure of mercury, place it in a red clay crucible, and refine it with nine ascents and nine descents, blending it with carp gall. Then take another unrestricted measure of mercury, seal and coat it securely as prescribed, and repeat the process of nine ascents and nine descents, blending it with dragon’s fat—this is called the Divine Talisman. Its four thousand companions are azurite, alum, halite, and sulfur, hence the saying \"they accompany it together.\"\n\nThe River Maid, the solitary younger sister,\nWith brows like crescent moons and skin white as luminous pearls.\nThe cinnabar of Changsha, radiant in hue,\nFrom youth steadfast and chaste, needing no husband.\nEast and west, north and south—her parents both present,\nHer body untouched, pure as a pearl.\nShe awaits the worthy scholar who must seek her,\nBold and forthright, her words like scripture.\nAt peace, her talents overflow,\nNever boasting falsely to others.\n\nThe \"River Maid\" is the yellow essence of lead. The \"worthy scholar\" is mercury. \"You illuminate the matchmaker’s role, causing them to dwell together\" means: take one *jin* of the yellow essence of lead, place it in an iron vessel, and heat it with charcoal. Then take seven *jin* of mercury and add it to the lead, firing it intensely. In an instant, their essences rise together, appearing like yellow-gold and purple-red, resembling shooting stars or flowing pearls, in hues of five colors and mysterious yellow. Use an iron spoon to gather it, obtaining nine *jin* of the one—this is the three transformations and nine revolutions, called the Flower of Cinnabar, also known as the Profound Yellow Essence or the Talisman of Heaven and Earth.\n\nRefine mercury with this to form the elixir, called the Returning Cinnabar, or the Divine Elixir of Immortality. The sages guard this secret; it is not for ordinary Daoist practitioners to know. Only the wise and enlightened, those of exceptional insight, can comprehend it. Thus the texts do not exhaust their words, nor do words exhaust their meaning.\n\nTherefore, the scripture says: \"The essence of cinnabar gives birth to the essence of the sun—radiant and luminous.\" The \"child of the sun\" is fire, hence fire is called \"Child Illuminator.\" Mercury is also called \"Child Companion,\" as the *Yi* says. The essence of cinnabar gives birth to the sun, and the Great Yin gives birth to the moon. The moon’s position is in the north at *kan*, its number one—thus knowing the One, all things are complete. The One is lead. The essence of lead gives birth to the moon, and the essence of lead is called the Stone of the Great Yin. It is also named Metal Duke, River Chariot, Old Woman of the River, or Standing Regulator Stone.\n\nFools who prepare the medicine mistakenly use the Standing Regulator Stone from the mountains—this is wrong, a thousand miles from the Dao. The Perfected One transforms the yellow essence of lead into the Standing Regulator Stone and gall, all derived from lead. Foolish commoners, alchemists, and meddlers who prepare the medicine mistakenly use Qiangli gall—this is wrong, a thousand miles from the Dao, and their medicine will not form.\n\nThe Perfected One refines the essence of cinnabar into flowing pearls, frost, and snow, while the essence of lead transforms into the Returning Cinnabar. When yellow and white are achieved, consuming it grants immortality. Without these two substances in the preparation, even if one obtains the elixir and consumes it, they will still die.\n\nThe Great Yin is lead, and the Great Yang is cinnabar. The Great Yin is the position of *kan*, at *zi*. The Great Yang is the position of *li*, at *wu*. Thus *kan* gives birth to the moon, and *li* gives birth to the sun. The sun is the husband, the moon the wife. The sun is male, the moon female. Lodestone and lead belong to the Great Yin, positioned at *zi*, their number one. Cinnabar belongs to the Yang, positioned at *wu*, its number nine. Realgar belongs to earth, its number five. Thus it is said: one, five, nine—fifteen in total—hence the Perfected One calls it the Three-Five. Knowing the Three-Five, one may traverse the world. Those who know the Three-Five and prepare the Returning Cinnabar to consume will attain longevity and immortality—thus they traverse the world.\n\nTherefore, the Perfected One said: \"Knowing the Three Marvels and Six Harmonies, what need is there for anything else?\" Cinnabar is the male, lead the female. Thus the tradition says: \"The father is the Three Marvels, the mother the Six Harmonies. Master this Dao—what need is there for enfeoffment?\" This is its meaning.\n\n\"You illuminate the matchmaker’s role, causing them to dwell together\" means: take nine *jin* of mercury and one *jin* of lead, combine them in a red clay crucible, and fire them intensely from dawn until sunset. The mercury and the essence of lead will emerge together, golden in color—this is called the Profound Yellow Essence, also known as Yellow Sprout or Yellow Light.\n\nTake the Cinnabar Blossom and infuse it with water—this is called Yellow Pool, also known as Yellow Blossom, Yellow Dragon, or Dark-Restraining Stone. Combine the Profound Yellow with Dark Water, shaping it like a sealed-clay pellet, and place it in a red clay crucible. Seal it with Six-One Mud, both inside and out, to a thickness of three *fen*, then let it dry for ten days without leakage. Fire it with horse dung or chaff for eighty-one days, coinciding with *geng-xin*. *Geng-xin* is the name for yellow gold. The Perfected One guarded this secret, never speaking of \"yellow gold,\" hence writing \"gold\" as *geng-xin*. Take one *dao-gui* of Profound Yellow and place it in intense fire, fanning it with a bellows until, in the time it takes to cook a meal, it all transforms into *geng-xin*. If it fails to become *geng-xin*, the fire will cause the medicine to fly away, and the raw substance cannot be consumed. Return it to the red clay crucible, fire it as before, seal and coat it, and after eighty-one days, the medicine will be ready for use.\n\nProfound Yellow is also called Hidden Cinnabar or Purple Powder. To consume it, always at dawn on a *jia-zi* day, face east toward the sun, bow twice, and swallow a pellet the size of a small bean. Take one pill daily, and after a hundred days, all illnesses will be cured. The Profound Yellow medicine cures severe leprosy and scabies, healing all ailments within a hundred days—there is nothing it cannot treat.\n\n\"You illuminate the matchmaker’s role, causing them to dwell together, yet they refuse to listen and wish to petition\" refers to mercury not yet harmonized with lead. \"Later, they meet the divine husband again\" refers to the mercury. \"You press them\" means applying fire. \"You press them with the red crucible\" means the red clay crucible. \"You\" refers to fire. \"Eventually, they listen to each other, their hues radiant\" describes lead and mercury combining and flying together to form Profound Yellow. \"Radiant hues\" means the medicine’s color is exceptionally fine.\n\n\"The husband comes from without, the wife from within; like fish and water, they attain harmony and depend on each other.\" \"In the four seasons, they bear offspring like divine huts, their five-colored glow over an inch thick\" means that when the male and female essences unite, they no longer fly away. Then, take the Profound Yellow, blend it with the Hundred-Day Blossom Pool until it resembles mud, and coat the inside and outside of two red clay crucibles to a thickness of three *fen*. Place three *jin* of mercury within—up to ten *jin* may be used, depending on the desired quantity of medicine. Flying three *jin* of mercury suffices for one person’s transcendence, as the medicine is potent. Flying one *jin* yields ten *liang*.\n\nTo fly the Profound Yellow: take one *jin* of mercury, place it in a red clay crucible, and cover it with Profound Yellow to a depth of two *cun*. Seal it with another red clay crucible, coating the joint with Six-One Mud as in the Cinnabar Blossom method. Fire it with horse dung or chaff for nine days and nights, and the mercury will all fly upward, adhering to the crucible’s interior like frost or snow, shimmering in purple, red, and five colors—hence the description of a five-colored glow over an inch thick. Brush it off with a feather, then blend it with Yellow *Shu*. If repeating the process, Yellow *Shu* is the gall of a yellow dog. Alternatively, blend it with the River Earl’s Remnant, which is carp gall. Take the carp gall and mix it with the flying frost-and-snow (the mercury’s flying essence), forming a seal like a clay pellet. Return it to a red clay crucible, cover it again with Profound Yellow Essence to a depth of one *cun*, and seal it with another red clay crucible. Coat the joint with Six-One Mud to prevent leakage, then place it in the sun for ten days to thoroughly dry. Only then may it be fired.\n\nFiring must not be done hastily, lest the crucible crack and the great medicine be lost. Fire it again for nine days and nights, then stop. After cooling for a day, open it and brush off the flying essence—crimson and purple—called the Divine Talisman Returning Cinnabar. Blend it with Dragon Grease, forming pellets the size of small beans. At dawn, face east toward the sun, bow twice, kneel, and consume it. After a hundred days, you will be accompanied by divine immortals and jade maidens, moving with the gods as swiftly as flight. To cross rivers and seas, mix the Divine Talisman Cinnabar with Dragon Gall Grease or carp gall, and apply it to the soles of your feet. You may traverse the Yangtze, Yellow River, Huai, Wei, or Ji without wetting your feet or drowning—hence the saying, \"feet remain dry.\" Attaining the Dao and transcending the world, all illnesses leave the body, granting deathlessness and freedom from all ailments.\n\nAfter consuming the medicine for a hundred days, the Three Worms and Three Corpses in the abdomen will all decay and perish. Earth Dragon and fish gall are both yin essences, while mercury is yang essence. Thus, yin can restrain yang, rendering the medicine docile and preventing it from rising. The Perfected, the Divine, and the Immortals guard this secret and do not transmit it.\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"The third elixir is called Divine Cinnabar, its five colors intermingled—truly a sight to behold.\" It originates from the true yang of Wudu’s seclusion, referring to true realgar and orpiment, both produced in Zhengyang Wudu. Wuyang also yields realgar, pure and white, with a fine texture. \"Divine\" means that among the Eight Stones, realgar and orpiment repel weapons, cure all illnesses, and are especially potent. \"Pure and white\" refers to selecting the finest specimens. \"A worthy man’s value is twenty thousand coins\" means that flying realgar and orpiment yields a flying essence worth ten thousand coins per *dao-gui*. \"Their complexions fair, their eyes bright\" describes the flying medicine of realgar and orpiment, producing five splendid colors. \"Roaming at dawn and dusk, halting at famous mountains\" refers to the flying essence adhering to the upper crucible—hence \"halting at famous mountains.\" \"Alchemists dare not seize it\" means that the Daoist uses two red clay crucibles to fly the essence, ensuring it does not escape. \"Take the lower earth and stone\" means collecting the flying essence. The method: take two *jin* of realgar and one *jin* of orpiment, totaling three *jin*. First, soak the medicine in the Blossom Pool to prevent it from scattering and flying away.\n\nAfter steeping realgar and orpiment for a hundred days, combine them and place in an iron mortar, grinding ten thousand strokes until they become a fine powder. Transfer this into a red clay crucible, covering it with a layer of *xuanhuang* powder one *cun* thick on all sides—top, bottom, and around. Seal with *liuyi* mud to prevent leakage, then dry in the sun for ten days. Next, use horse dung as fuel to fly the medicine for nine days and nine nights, keeping the fire five *cun* from the crucible’s edge. Then, intensify the fire for another nine days and nine nights, gradually moving it beneath the crucible. Strengthen the fire further for nine days and nine nights, then raise it to the crucible’s midpoint, continuing for another nine days and nine nights—totaling thirty-six days in four cycles of nine.\n\nOn the following day, allow it to cool before opening. Sweep the flying essence with a chicken feather, mix it with dragon fat, and fly it again following the method for refining *danhua*. Fire it for three cycles of nine, twenty-seven days in all. The next day, let it cool and open it, sweeping the essence with a chicken feather. This is called *flying essence*, which, when refined into medicine, is named *divine elixir*. When Daoists consume it, they become immortals, achieving transcendence in no more than a hundred days. Even the foolish, if they take it, will ascend in a year—not through the work of ghosts or spirits.\n\nMen and women, common folk and children—all who consume this medicine become immortals. Those who take it and strike it become great spirits. *Ziming* harmonizes the union, for *Ziming* is the fire that unites them. When realgar and orpiment combine with fire to produce flying essence, carefully seal the seams to ensure firmness. Coat the inner and outer surfaces of the red clay crucible with *liuyi* mud, each layer three *fen* thick. First, mix *xuanhuang* with the Blossom Pool liquid to a mud-like consistency, then apply it to both red clay crucibles, ensuring no leakage—this is what is meant by \"ensuring firmness.\"\n\nTake oyster shell, red halloysite, and magnetite—three substances in equal parts—grind each ten thousand strokes into powder, and blend with *zuowei*. First, evenly distribute the Blossom Pool liquid within to prevent moisture or leakage. Then, take the flying essence of realgar and orpiment, mix it with dragon fat, and let the ingredients interact. This refers to refining the nine divine elixirs and flying essence; without dragon fat, the medicine lacks potency. Thus, it is said, \"mix with dragon fat and let the ingredients interact,\" and consuming it grants immortality and longevity for ten thousand years.\n\nIt is said that after consuming the divine elixir for a hundred days, all spirits descend to welcome you: perfected beings, jade maidens, jade lads, the White Maiden, and the Azure Waist, along with the hundred ghosts of mountains, marsh officials, and marsh wardens—all come to serve the Daoist and guide them to transcendence. There is no inherent distinction; even slaves, maidservants, chickens, and dogs can attain immortality. All who consume the medicine achieve this.\n\nOne must dwell in seclusion: to take the divine elixir, reside in a mountain cave, a stone chamber, a great marsh, near a riverside valley, or an empty dwelling. Be cautious not to converse with worldly fools—do not let those who gossip or envy, or those who dislike the Dao, learn of your work. Avoid contact with households involved in burials, weddings, or betrothals. Always sleep alone in a chamber, and the immortal jade maidens will surely descend.\n\nRevere the spirits: when consuming the divine elixir, heavenly spirits, immortals, and jade maidens descend. One must serve them with reverence, contemplate the celestial Dao without negligence, and dwell in a stone chamber near a famous mountain. To refine and consume the elixir, choose a deep marsh or uninhabited place, unseen by worldly eyes. Only by residing in mountain caves and rocky seclusion can one obtain the divine elixir and ascend to heaven. Once the divine elixir is complete, the entire household becomes immortal. Officials, chickens, and dogs rise amid the azure clouds—yet in the world, such prosperity is rare and departure difficult. Worldly people, greedy for wealth, refuse to refine the divine elixir, instead consuming herbal medicines and practicing *daoyin*, only to die without longevity. Thus, departure is exceedingly difficult.\n\nHerbal medicines can cure a hundred illnesses but cannot grant long life or immortality. Why? Herbs rot when buried and char when boiled; if they cannot preserve themselves, how can they grant humans longevity? The Perfected One said: The fourth elixir is called *Returning Elixir*, and nine brothers may share it. The \"nine\" refers to the nine substances used to line the crucible. Take stalactite, alum, hematite, halite, oyster shell, red halloysite, *tulongji*, mica, and talc—nine substances in all. Burn each for a day and a night with intense fire, then grind them into powder. Mix with fermented liquid to a mud-like consistency and use it to coat the inner and outer surfaces of the clay crucible, each layer five *fen* thick. Let it dry in the shade for ten days.\n\nThen place mercury in the crucible, cover it with realgar, followed by azurite, alum, sulfur, bittern, *taiyi yuyuliang*, and stalactite—with stalactite alone on top. Each of the seven substances is processed separately into powder. Place one *jin* of mercury at the bottom, layering the rest in order. Seal the crucible with *liuyi* mud mixed with fine fermented liquid, ensuring no leakage, and dry in the sun for ten days. Place it on five iron pillars, nine *cun* high, and heat with horse dung or chaff fire, keeping it five *cun* from the crucible’s base. Maintain a gentle fire for nine days and nine nights, then increase the fire to the crucible’s midpoint for another nine days and nine nights. Continuously cover the crucible with damp cloth to prevent the medicine from flying away; rewet the cloth when it dries. Following the method for refining *danhua*, after eighty-one days in nine cycles of nine, the medicine will ascend and adhere, forming five colors. Sweep it with a chicken feather, mix with a hundred flower essences and well water, and consume one *dao-gui*. Lie in a stone chamber, and one will no longer hunger or thirst for a hundred years. When thirsty, drink from a stone spring; when hungry, eat twenty dates or chestnuts. Remain tranquil and contemplate the divine medicine. Take it once daily, and after a hundred days, vermilion phoenixes will soar above you, and jade maidens will arrive.\n\nAfter two hundred days of consuming the medicine, immortals will accompany you on your journeys. After one year, the Great One will come to receive you. If you use the returned elixir to coat coins for market transactions, the coins will all return to you. If you write with the elixir on your eyelids while lying down, evil spirits will all flee. One *dao-gui* of powder mixed with a catty of mercury, when fired, immediately transforms into yellow gold. It must be blended with dragon’s fat and refined for nine days and nine nights to become true yellow gold.\n\n*The Scripture of the Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls and the Nine Elixirs of Divine Immortals, Scroll the Upper, concludes here.*\n*The Scripture of the Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls and the Nine Elixirs of Divine Immortals, Scroll the Lower.*\n*Transmitted by the Perfected One of Great Clarity*\n\nThe Perfected One’s Divine Water Method:\nThe Perfected One said: The fifth elixir is called *Er Dan* (\"Edible Elixir\"). It originated with a scholar from Wuling in Changsha, a man of the Taiyi Xunshi and the Zhu clan. The \"man of the Zhu clan\" refers to mercury. The \"scholar from Wuling\" refers to realgar. The \"Taiyi Xunshi\" refers to *yuyugen* (limonite). Take one catty of mercury and one catty of realgar, grind them into powder, and place the mercury on top. Take one catty of *yuyugen*, grind it into powder, and place it atop the realgar. Seal them in an earthen crucible, joining two crucibles at their mouths and sealing them with Six-One Mud. Allow it to dry, then fire it with horse dung or chaff for nine days and nine nights. Then refine it with charcoal fire for another nine days and nine nights, and the medicine will all ascend and adhere to the upper crucible. *Ziming* is the catalyst, and the \"worthy scholar\" is gold. Both are combined with mercury, mixed with *tianxiong* (aconite), and blended with dragon’s fat and equal parts of Shaoshi human male essence.\n\nThe \"Divine Sparrow Child\" refers to a chicken egg. Consuming one *dao-gui* will suddenly transport you ten thousand *li* away, allowing you to cross rivers and seas. If taken for no more than thirty days, one will gain the ability to fly within that time. All spirits will come and go to guard your left and right, with ten thousand spirits attending and serving you. Jade maidens and green-waisted attendants will be at your command. You will ride a spontaneous chariot and ascend to heaven. Accompanied by jade maidens, all the gods of the world will serve you, and the spirits of the hundred deities, village altars, and state sacrifices—along with the Wind Earl and Rain Master—will all come to attend you. Thus, it is called the \"Fifth Elixir, the Mother,\" and is also named *Er Dan*.\n\nThe Perfected One said: The sixth elixir is called *Lian Dan* (\"Refined Elixir\"), which is subtly wondrous and revered by all divine immortals. It comes from the distant lands of the Man and Yi tribes in Ba and Yue. It is said that Yue cinnabar originates from the Yue countryside in Ba Commandery. Choose specimens with eyes like pearls and mouths like cinnabar—those that are fresh and bright. The worthy do not take it from among the people; instead, they use earthworm fat and the flying essence of the Eight Stones. For thirty days, the stones are refined for thirty days. The Eight Stones are: Ba cinnabar, Yue cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, *zengqing* (azurite), alum, magnetite, and chalcanthite. Combine equal parts of these eight substances as the medicine, adjusting quantities as needed. Blend them with dragon’s fat and one *dou* of earthworm fat, then mix with the gallbladder of a yellow dog and two *dou* of earthworm fat to form the crucible. Use three catties each of oyster shell and red halloysite, grinding them into powder with left-flavored saliva. The \"left flavor\" refers to fermented rice liquid. Mix them into a mud and coat the inside and outside of the earthen crucible to a thickness of three *fen*. Harmonize *Ziming* and adjust until it can be formed into pills. Use a small fire and seal the crucible’s seams with mud to prevent leakage. When the Eight Stones ascend, they will adhere like frost and snow, their essence and color resembling such. Blend them with dragon’s fat, and the resulting pills will be the size of small beans, suitable for consumption. Once the yellow and white (gold and silver) are formed, the medicine is complete and can be used to create gold and silver. All spirits will respectfully heed your commands, and the hundred ghosts and gods will all be at your service. After consuming it, one may fast for ten days. Not only men but women may also take it. Women who consume it will likewise become flying immortals. To practice grain avoidance, one must abstain from the Five Grains and drink only water, eliminating all distracting thoughts. If one engages in sexual relations with women, the Dao will certainly not be achieved. When preparing the medicine, avoid sweetness, bitterness, and regret, for if the body becomes tainted, it will be difficult to remedy.\n\nGrind each of the Eight Stones separately into powder. Place Ba cinnabar and Yue cinnabar at the bottom, followed by realgar, then orpiment, then *zengqing*, then alum, then chalcanthite, and finally magnetite at the top. Seal them in an earthen crucible, joining two crucibles and sealing them with Six-One Mud. Coat the seams with oyster shell and red halloysite, then refine them with horse dung or chaff fire, following the method for refining *danhua*. Refine them for thirty days, collect the ascended essence, blend it with dragon’s fat, and form pills the size of small beans. Consume them after meals, and the residue can be used to treat all illnesses, with divine efficacy.\n\nThe Perfected One said: The seventh elixir is called *Rou Dan* (\"Supple Elixir\"), which resembles *Er Dan* but is smoother and easier to consume. Take three catties of mercury, first blend it with *xuanhuang* (mysterious yellow) and left-flavored liquid to form a mud, and coat the inside and outside of the crucible to a thickness of three *fen*. Place the mercury inside, seal it with Six-One Mud, and ensure no leakage. Allow it to dry for ten days, then refine it following the method for *danhua* for twenty days. Collect the ascended essence and blend it with dragon’s fat. If one desires children, blend it with *quepen* (broken basin herb). When a ninety-year-old man consumes it, his yang qi will greatly strengthen, and he may father children again. If one uses *Rou Dan* to anoint the spirit tablets of ancestral spirits, the tablets will become imbued with divine power. If one writes with *Rou Dan* on the bodies of servants, they will not dare to flee. When an eighty-year-old woman consumes it, she may bear children again. When an official consumes it, he will be promptly promoted.\n\nThe method for refining the elixir follows the *danhua* process, and the sage who observes purification rites will attain great divinity. Those who govern others are true persons. Without purification rites, the elixir will lack divine power. One must seek the River Maiden for marriage to obtain named lead. The River Maiden is mercury, which, when united with lead in essence, can produce gold and silver, mutually perfecting one another. For those who wish to bear descendants, no elixir will fail to form, and no transformation will remain unachieved. It grants immortality and the attainment of transcendence.\n\nThe True Person said: The eighth elixir is called *Fudan* (Subduing Elixir), its color a deep blackish-purple, yet it gathers the five hues. It can restrain ghosts and repel villains. When written with this elixir on doors and gates, it slays malevolent spirits and wards off thieves. The method for its preparation: use a red earthen crucible or a *longji* crucible, coating the inside and outside with *xuanhuang* or lead to a thickness of three *fen*. Seal it with Six-One Mud, ensuring no leakage. Place mercury inside the crucible, seal it, and allow it to dry. Refine it with horse dung or chaff fire for nine days and nine nights. Then, invert the crucible so the upper becomes the lower, and refine it again for nine days and nine nights. Repeat this inversion nine times, alternating upper and lower, until the elixir is complete. Collect the ascended essence, blend it with dragon’s fat, and refine it again for ten days. The ascended portion, when processed, resembles powder. Store it in a vessel of gold, silver, or fresh bamboo. At dawn, face east, bow twice, kneel, and consume one *daogui* with well-water drawn at dawn. This grants transcendence. A piece the size of a jujube pit, carried in one’s headscarf, will cause all ghosts to vanish and dare not approach. It strengthens the hun and po souls, allowing one to dwell alone in a stone chamber and attain transcendence. Tigers and wolves will naturally avoid one. If a woman lives alone and holds a piece the size of a soybean, all ghosts will depart, and thieves will not dare approach.\n\nThe method for preparing the elixir: take one *jin* of mercury, adjusting the quantity as desired. Seal it following the *dan* method, coating with Six-One Mud. Two earthen crucibles may be used, or a crucible coated with *xuanhuang*, or a Luoyang red earthen crucible, or a lead-powder crucible, with size adjusted as needed. Blend with dragon’s fat and refine for three days. Collect the ascended portion, which will be snow-white. Blend it again with dragon’s fat for ten days. When the elixir is complete, process it as in the *danhua* method. Four agents nurture one mother: *cengqing*, magnetite, *yushi*, and *xuanhuang* are placed atop it.\n\nThe True Person said: The ninth elixir is called *Handan* (Cold Elixir). Its method takes gold and silver as the foundation, using them as the primary metal. The five agents gather in equal measure. The five minerals are mercury, realgar, orpiment, *cengqing*, *yushi*, and magnetite. Take one *jin* each of the five divine agents and two *jin* of mercury, processing them separately. Grind the five agents into powder and place them in the crucible. First coat the crucible with *xuanhuang*, then add *liuzhu* (flowing pearls) to the crucible. Layer realgar over the mercury, followed by orpiment, *cengqing*, *yushi*, and magnetite, with magnetite on top. Seal two earthen crucibles together with Six-One Mud, ensuring no leakage. Mix equal parts dragon’s saliva and yellow earth to form mud, then remove the earth. First coat the crucible’s seams with *muli* and *chishizhi* mud to a thickness of three *fen*, then coat the exterior with dragon’s saliva and yellow earth to the same thickness. Allow it to dry for ten days. Refine it with *Ziming*’s method, using gentle fire. The divine elixir will ascend and adhere like stalactites. Refine it for nine days and nine nights, then collect the ascended elixir, sweeping it with a rooster’s feather. Blend it with dragon’s fat or the gallbladder of a yellow dog. Consuming it lightens the body, and after a hundred days, all illnesses are cured. The Azure Waist Attendant commands, and the Jade Maiden of Destiny records one’s name in the registers of the transcendent’s abyssal palace. It is said that consuming the Returning Elixir for a hundred days erases one’s name from the ledgers of the living and the dead, inscribing it in the records of immortals. One may come and go without question, unbound by restraints, able to vanish while seated or standing. It grants the power to ascend and fly to the heavens, traversing ten thousand *li* in an instant upon floating clouds. One may abandon wife and children, never to return.\n\nThe method for the ninth elixir follows the *danhua* process. The earthen crucibles, sealing, mud coating, and firing methods are all the same. The fire should begin gently and later intensify. For the first nine days, use gentle fire, then increase its strength. The crucible’s coating must be thoroughly dried, and the longer it is fired, the better. If the crucible cracks like a hair, the elixir will escape. When processing all mud-based elixirs, grind them thoroughly into fine powder and sift them. Mixing with *zuowei* is beneficial. *Dami* wine is also called the Flowery Pool. It is best gathered on the fifth day of the fifth month or the seventh day of the seventh month, though the fifth day of the fifth month is optimal. Dragon’s fat and dragon’s saliva are the dew on mulberry leaves. To collect them, wipe with silk and wring out the liquid.\n\nThe Nine Tripods are the nine elixirs. Eighty-one chapters derive from one elixir; those who attain it ascend to the Great Clarity. Through fire, the elixir transforms naturally, with agents mutually aiding and depending on one another. The Dao of water and fire is most divine. The ancestors of the nine clans begin with water. Metal and wood unite as husband and wife, while the sun, moon, and stars rely on yin and yang. When essence gathers, fire reigns supreme. My surname is Lingyang, and my style is Ziming. I strike down the Hu barbarians and punish the powerful, extending my reach to Ba and Yue, encroaching upon Yuzhang. The four barbarians submit and unite at the center. The three yin forces restrain one another, and the soft overcomes the strong. The Azure Dragon and White Tiger soar east and west, while the Vermilion Phoenix and Scarlet Bird blaze brilliantly. The twelve-tiered tower of gold holds within it the Dark Warrior, the divine tortoise leading the chorus. Five-colored curtains drape the jade chamber, where the True Person ascends to the Nine Emperors. Roaming the Great Clarity and the Hall of Light, their radiant essence leaps forth like snow and frost. Those who know this elixir become lords of immortals.\n\nThe True Person said: The *Huagai* (Canopy) is the yellow essence of lead. When realgar is added, it can cover the elixir of male transcendents.\n\nLead is the Canopy, referring to divine water, hence called \"lead’s yellow essence.\" When crafting lead water, it begins with the yellow essence, thus the name is derived from its origin. When realgar’s yellow essence is mentioned, it refers to flying lead becoming frost-like, hence the name is tied to its origin. When it speaks of realgar, it means \"flying,\" thus the term *xiong* (male/realgar). The reason it speaks of \"entering\" is that lead is the Great Yang; when it meets yin, it enters and merges with the yellow essence. Thus, it is said to \"enter.\"\n\nThe reason it speaks of \"covering the elixir of male transcendents\" is that these two essences merge in primordial chaos, enveloping the flowing pearl to preserve the spirit and prevent its departure. Thus, \"covering\" means yin embracing yang. Therefore, \"covering the male\" refers to lead. The reason it is called an \"immortal elixir\" is that lead transforms into cinnabar, the medicine of immortality.\n\nFor fine realgar, take one *jin*. Use two yellow clay crucibles, place the realgar inside one, and cover it with the other. Seal the seam with white dog’s hair mixed into mud, applying a layer three *fen* thick. Alternatively, use red halloysite, oyster shell powder, or limestone ash as sealant, ensuring no leaks. Let it dry in the shade for seven days, or even several tens of days for better results. Heat it with reed firewood. Before burning, inspect the crucible for fine cracks and reseal them. Before heating, fashion three mud sparrows. Place one on the crucible; when it dries, remove it and replace it with another. After the third sparrow dries, the medicine is ready. Remove the crucible and let it cool. Regulate the fire—neither too fierce nor too weak—so the medicine rises to the crucible’s lid, appearing ethereal, like frost or snow, with stalactite-like formations. If the medicine is not fully refined, repeat the firing as before, resealing the crucible as needed.\n\nOnce refined, take seven feathers from the left wing of a three-year-old white rooster and sweep the medicine into a bronze vessel or tray. Then, take two hundred *jin* of pig intestines, wash them thoroughly, and wipe them clean with cloth. Place the medicine inside, tie the ends tightly, and set it in a steamer. Place cooked rice on top, along with one *hu* and five *dou* of millet—or two *hu* if unavailable, or even one *shi*. Steam it. If the intestines rupture, add another layer on top. After one night, add another intestine, steaming for three days and three nights, using three intestines in total. The medicine will then be ready for shaping into pills.\n\nForm the pills into the size of a crossbow pellet. After three days of ingestion, the Three Worms will die. After ten days, the corpse will descend, and at night, a glow will be visible. Refine the medicine further into sesame-sized pills. At dawn, face east, bow twice, and ingest them. On cloudy days, take them toward the sunrise. After a hundred days, even in winter, a single layer of clothing will suffice, and the Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist will arrive. Beware of taking a wife; instead, nurture the Jade Maiden to seek the Dao.\n\nAfter a hundred and fifty days, the Jade Maiden will depart, and another will come, adorned with a jade hairpin on her nose, as large as a millet grain—this is the true Jade Maiden. Beware of marriage. One must remain humble, avoiding foul, rank, or impure places. How could a sage deign to descend to such?\n\nThe Jade Maiden said: \"I saw you consume the divine medicine, and your radiant essence appeared in the heavens. Thus, I have come to be your wife.\" Beware of marriage. She then spoke of the solitary and ignorant, of jade blossoms and jade wine, of the Five Emperors’ Flowery Pond and the Yang of the Celestial Springs—things never tasted, only obtained by sages. The Jade Maiden then retrieved them, and after drinking, you will roam the Six Directions together, ascend the Celestial Pass, and meet the sages. At night, you will descend the Celestial Pass to dwell with the True Person in the Pure Subtlety. Why seek the name of immortality? You will transcend the mortal realm, entering and exiting without obstruction.\n\nAt this time, observe a twelve-year period of strict purification. The Jade Maiden is the daughter of the Heavenly Emperor. The one you nurture is the daughter of the White Emperor. The Azure-Waisted one is the daughter of the Wind Earl. If you wish to roam freely, crossing rivers and seas at will for ten thousand generations, remain ever constant.\n\nAnother method states: When Wu Du realgar is refined, it should resemble silver. If it dries, mix it with honey. Daoists must always observe purification rites.\n\nAnother method states: Do not lend clothing, footwear, or other personal items to others.\n\n**Methods of the True Person’s Divine Water (attached to various methods)**\n\nThe True Person’s method for making Divine Water: Take one *dou* of fine lacquer and place eighteen large, overnight-soaked crabs into it. After three days, they will dissolve into water, and the medicine will be complete, called Divine Water.\n\nThis Divine Water enables one to enter and exit without obstruction and command a hundred ghosts.\n\nThe method of ingestion: Mix one cup of clear wine with half a *ge* of Divine Water and drink it. In a secluded, tranquil place, after one day, the three worms in the abdomen will all be expelled. Then, partake of fine foods for fifteen days before drinking another small cup of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine. After two days, a three-foot-tall person will appear before you. Say, \"Excellent! But do not speak with them at length, or the matter will not succeed.\" Then, partake of fine foods for another fifteen days before drinking one and a half cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine. After three days, even a team of four horses will be unable to catch you. After another fifteen days, drink two cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine, and your aspirations will soar, your sight and hearing sharpen. After another fifteen days, drink two and a half cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine, and white hair will turn black again, fallen teeth regrow. After another fifteen days, drink three cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine, and the elderly will become youths; on *jiǎzǐ* and *jiǎxū* days, spirits will arrive. After another fifteen days, drink three and a half cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine. After another fifteen days, drink four cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine; on *jiǎshēn* and *jiǎwǔ* days, spirits will arrive, the *Sea Chart* will appear, and you will enter and exit without obstruction. After another fifteen days, drink five cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine; on *jiǎchén* and *jiǎyín* days, spirits will arrive, and the *Sun and Moon Chart* will appear. After another fifteen days, drink six cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine, and you will neither sleep nor lie down. The *Chart of Heaven and Earth* will arrive, the Five Flowers will all come, you will cast no shadow, your calls will draw no echo, and you will be formless and indistinct, rising and sinking with heaven and earth. This is a secret—do not transmit it recklessly.\n\nTo compound the medicine, use the Immortal’s *Fèng Gāng* method. On the first day of the first month, take one *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it. On the second day of the second month, take one *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it. On the third day of the third month, take one *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it. On the fourth day of the fourth month, take one *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it. On the fifth day of the fifth month, take one *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it. Seal and coat the containers, and each month, after collecting the water and flowers, reseal them to prevent leakage, storing them in a cold, dark place. From the sixth to the eighth month, whenever there are flowering plants, place them into the water without adding more water, mixing them into the existing infusion. On the ninth day of the ninth month, take another *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it, then transfer it to a white jar, seal it tightly to prevent leakage, and store it in a cold place. Bury it indoors, three *chi* deep into the earth, and after a hundred days, all will dissolve. On a *wáng* day, simmer it over a gentle fire with a bundle of reeds, using bamboo for fuel, until it can be formed into pills. This medicine can revive the dead, transform forms, and alter bodies, allowing one to become a flying immortal. If a person has died and their breath is gone, place this medicine into their mouth, and they will revive.\n\nIf, after the prescribed days, the various ingredients have not dissolved, remove the dregs and mix them with *fú líng* and jujube paste, then take three pills the size of large soybeans at once, one dose per day, without missing a day.\n\nImmortal Lǚ Gōng, styled Wénjìng, received the *Reviving the Dead* formula. It is said that Gōng left home for over two hundred years, and all his descendants had died. Upon his return, he exhumed the dead and applied the medicine to them, and they all revived with flesh and became human again, speaking clearly without error—over a hundred dead were brought back to life.\n\nThe formula: On the first day of the first month, take five *jīn* of bamboo roots. On the second day of the second month, take five *jīn* of pine roots. On the third day of the third month, take five *jīn* of parasol roots. On the fourth day of the fourth month, take five *jīn* of *rěn dōng* roots. On the fifth day of the fifth month, take five *jīn* of *mài mén dōng* roots. On the sixth day of the sixth month, take five *jīn* of *tiān mén dōng* roots. Add one *liǎng* each of three types of cinnamon, five *liǎng* of realgar, and three *liǎng* of ginseng. Wash all the roots well, dry them in the shade, then grind them into fine powder and sift them into a white jar, sealing it tightly to prevent leakage. After a hundred days, open the seal. On a *wáng xiàng* day, purify yourself in a separate room where no one can see, and pound the mixture fifty thousand times. Place it in an oilcloth bag, wrapping it in silk. Take a square-inch spoonful five times a day, always at dawn, noon, dusk, the hour of *réndìng*, and the hour of *jīmíng*, using clear wine. After eating, consume five jujubes, maintain purity of mind, and after a hundred days, you will attain the Dao.\n\nIf you wish to transform and act freely, you must obtain the *Qīng Shé Zú* (Green Snake’s Foot) from a journey in the fifth month. Without this medicine, transformation is impossible. This medicine revives flesh on white bones. Daoists who ingest it will prolong their years, prevent their hair from turning white, their teeth from falling out, and their faces from losing luster. Their essence will be full, their bones strengthened, and they will abstain from grains without hunger or thirst. Poisons will not harm them, their spirits will always be joyful, and whatever they summon will arrive, whatever they dismiss will depart. They can summon wind and rain, command thunderbolts, enter water without sinking, and walk through fire without melting. Blades cannot pierce them, blades cannot wound them. They can ride clouds and travel without bounds, cure all illnesses, summon traveling kitchens, command ten thousand ghosts, and know their thoughts, instantly controlling them. As long as one obtains the method, there is nothing in the world that cannot be achieved.\n\nFor a dead person lying on the ground, use a knife to open their mouth and place five spoonfuls of the medicine into it, and they will revive in a moment.\n\nTo perform transformations, take the afterbirth of a firstborn son born on the fifth day of the fifth month. If the medicine is compounded in abundance, two people may obtain it.\n\nZhi (fungi/immortality herbs) come in many kinds: mushroom zhi, herbaceous zhi, woody zhi, and flesh zhi. They commonly grow on high mountains, beneath large trees, and beside spring waters. Mushroom zhi appear in five colors: red ones resemble cinnabar, black ones like fine lacquer, white ones like frost and snow, yellow ones like refined gold, green ones like the head feathers of a drake, purple ones like newly dyed purple silk, and crimson ones like peach blossoms. To determine whether it is true zhi, dry it in the shade for a hundred days—if its color remains unchanged, it is genuine.\n\nWhen entering famous mountains to gather zhi and herbs, one must first purify through fasting. Do not enter the homes of the bereaved or those where a woman has recently given birth, and abstain from pungent and meaty foods. Wear white garments, carry a white chicken, and hold a peck of white salt; alternatively, lead a white dog, and you will surely encounter zhi. Zhi may have two, three, four, or even five layers, with the most potent having nine layers. All can be consumed to attain immortality, allowing one to fly, see through all things, and command ghosts and spirits.\n\nThe method for gathering zhi is as follows: In spring, during the first, second, and third months, do not enter the mountains on *yin-mao* (寅卯) or *jia-yi* (甲乙) days. In summer, during the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, avoid *si-wu* (巳午) or *bing-ding* (丙丁) days. In autumn, during the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, do not enter on *shen-you* (申酉) or *geng-xin* (庚辛) days. In winter, during the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, avoid *hai-zi* (亥子) or *ren-gui* (壬癸) days.\n\nTo gather green zhi, go at dawn on *jia-yi* days when the sun rises, approaching from the east. Cut it with a wooden knife and store it in nine feet of green silk. For red zhi, go at mid-morning or noon on *bing-ding* days, approaching from the south. Cut it with a fish knife and store it in eight feet of crimson silk. For yellow zhi, go at dusk on *wu-ji* days, approaching from the northwest. Cut it with a metal knife and store it in one foot of yellow silk. For black zhi, go at midnight on *ren-gui* days, approaching from the north. Cut it with a bone knife and store it in five feet of black silk. For white zhi, go at sunset on *geng-xin* days, approaching from the west. Cut it with a wooden knife and store it in six feet of white silk.\n\nFlesh zhi include thousand-year-old bats, thousand-year-old spirit turtles, thousand-year-old swallows, and thousand-year-old swans. Consuming them grants immortality. A thousand-year-old bat is pure white and roosts upside down; eating it raw confers immortality. A thousand-year-old spirit turtle has horns on its head and a luminous shell with five-colored flames. Roast its shell, grind it into powder, and take a square-inch spoonful three times daily to become immortal. A thousand-year-old swallow nests facing north; eating it grants immortality. A thousand-year-old swan sings once every two hours, day and night, and is smaller than an ordinary swan. Roast its bones, grind them into powder, and take a square-inch spoonful three times daily to become immortal.\n\n*The Divine Immortal Recipes of Huainan* states: Things take form according to their kind—stalactites differ from pine mistletoe, which differs from mulberry mistletoe. This is the natural Dao of growth. Thus, when consumed, they harmonize with the six pitch-pipes and correspond to the seven stars.\n\nRehmannia root is the essence of the indistinct and imperceptible. Mulberry mistletoe is the essence of yang. Chrysanthemum blossoms are the essence of yin. Poria is the essence of wood. Plantago seeds are the essence of thunder and lightning. Kochia seeds are the essence of the constellations. Bamboo seeds are the essence of celestial blossoms and the Great One. These seven substances correspond to the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, encompassing the sun, moon, and five phases. When consumed in measured proportions, after nine days of purification, on the kingly days of the four seasons, take a pinch with three fingers of well-flower water, facing the sun. Drink once on yang days and twice on yin days. After forty-nine days, one will suddenly vanish.\n\nIn the first year of the Tianfeng era, Chen Yongbo of Nanyang had his nephew consume this medicine. After twenty-eight days, he suddenly disappeared without a trace. Yongbo took it himself and vanished after twenty-eight days, his whereabouts unknown. Yongbo’s son, Zengzhi, aged seventy-eight, along with his uncles and brothers, tested the medicine while bound by ropes. After twenty-eight days, they too vanished. The original recipe required forty-nine days for the transformation, but the timing was uncertain, so afterward, no one dared to consume it again.\n\nThe *xiàlíng* grows beneath the pine trees of Mount Hua in the Western Marchmount, taking the form of a *áoxiāo*. The bamboo fruit and mulberry mistletoe come from Lantian; the rehmannia is harvested in Weicheng in the fourth month. The bamboo fruit resembles rice grains, while the *dìfū* must have its skin removed before use.\n\nYang days are *jiǎ*, *bǐng*, *wù*, *gēng*, and *rén*; yin days are *yǐ*, *dīng*, *jǐ*, *xīn*, and *guǐ*.\n\nHere ends the *Lower Scroll of the Nine Elixirs of the Immortals: The Nine-Transformed Flowing Pearl*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Scripture of the Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls and the Nine Elixirs of Divine Immortals**\n\n**Title:** *The Scripture of the Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls and the Nine Elixirs of Divine Immortals*\nOriginally attributed to the Perfected One of Great Clarity, likely a fabrication by Daoist practitioners of the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. The early Tang *Treatise on Daoist Canons* (vol. 4) already cites this text, and its content closely resembles the nine-cycle elixir formulas recorded in the first volume of *The Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons’ Divine Elixirs*. *The Comprehensive Records·Bibliographic Treatise* lists this work in three volumes, though only two survive today.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Divine Arts*, *Category of Various Techniques*\n\n---\n\n### *The Scripture of the Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls and the Nine Elixirs of Divine Immortals, Volume One*\n**As Told by the Perfected One of Great Clarity**\n\n[Beginning missing]\n\nCinnabar is produced in many commanderies and counties, hence the saying that marriages are numerous. The Daoist observes the precepts and travels to the Five Capitals. The Five Capitals refer to the Five Sacred Peaks, where the divine medicine is to be concocted. The \"four thousand sons\" denote the purchase of mercury. \"Gold and silver added\" refers to the combination of lead and mercury, hence the phrase. \"Ziming cooks for his wife by the red furnace\" describes mercury and dark yellow (lead oxide) being mixed in an earthen cauldron. The \"red furnace\" is the name for the earthen cauldron. Mercury is the cauldron. The phrase \"mercury and lead combine, enraged and desiring to fly red\" refers to their fusion, hence the mention of \"mouth and teeth.\" \"Using mouth and teeth like abundant true yellow\" describes the transformation of lead and mercury into dark yellow. \"Steamed and covered in a soft bamboo basket like a bat\" refers to the sublimated essence of dark yellow, which must be steamed a hundred times. Hence the saying, \"steamed and covered at the head of the soft bamboo basket.\" \"The center like a softened bamboo basket\" refers to a fresh bamboo basket.\n\n\"Ziming trembles in fear, harboring the River Chariot within.\" Ziming is mercury, which, when heated, flees into lead. Lead is also called the River Chariot, hence the phrase \"harboring the River.\" \"Neighbors—realgar and cinnabar—reconcile and bid farewell to the household.\" This means that the sublimated essence should be mixed with realgar water and cinnabar water, hence the phrase \"bidding farewell to the household.\" \"Oyster shell and red halloysite ensure no deviation.\" The two earthen cauldrons should be sealed inside and out with a mixture of oyster shell and red halloysite, each layer three *fen* thick. \"Ensure no deviation\" means preventing the divine medicine and sublimated essences from escaping, hence the phrase.\n\nIt is said: Take twenty *jin* of oyster shell, mix it with red halloysite, grind them into powder, and blend with a hundred days’ fermentation to form a paste. Coat the inside and outside of the earthen cauldrons with this mixture, each layer three *fen* thick. Seal and let dry in the shade for ten days. Then sublime the mercury and dark yellow together, heating them nine times above and nine times below, until they turn the color of frost and purple, resembling onion blossoms. Only then will the two natures harmonize. \"The two natures harmonize\" means the medicine dares not flee and unites with the dark yellow, hence the phrase.\n\n\"At dusk, the bowels stir in responsive resonance\" describes the union of the two medicines, hence the phrase. \"Husband and wife play together, their colors suddenly blossoming; yin and yang meet, their joy unbounded.\" \"Joy unbounded\" signifies the completion of the divine medicine, bringing great delight to the household, hence the phrase. \"On the same day, a child is born like piled sand\" describes mercury and dark yellow sublimating together and adhering to the upper earthen cauldron like piled sand.\n\n\"The bronze feather and the next medicine, the earth dragon harmonized\": The \"bronze feather\" refers to the feathers of a three-year-old rooster, used to sweep the medicine and gather the sublimated essence. \"The earth dragon harmonized\" means mixing the elixir’s blossom with the juice of a white-necked earthworm and sublimating it again, hence the phrase. \"Capable of transmuting into gold and silver\" means that a *daorui* of elixir powder, combined with a *jin* of lead and mercury, will instantly become yellow gold when placed over a fierce fire, hence the phrase.\n\n\"Water is the yellow tooth.\" \"One *jin* with one *zhu*\" means taking one *zhu* of the nine-times-sublimated elixir blossom and powdering it with one *jin* of mercury—or one *jin* of lead or tin—will transmute them all into yellow gold. Hence the warning: \"One *jin* with one *zhu*, be cautious not to exceed.\" Excess makes the gold too hard for forging; deficiency makes it too soft. Hence the warning.\n\n\"Eating like millet and millet flying past one another\" means ascending to heaven. \"Sitting, one knows heaven and earth\" describes how, upon ingesting the elixir blossom, one instantly ascends and beholds all the gods above. \"Gazing afar at others\" means one’s eyes become so bright they can see ten thousand *li*, hence the phrase. \"Suddenly crossing ten thousand *li* of rivers and streams\" describes how, after ingesting the elixir blossom for a day and night, one may instantly fly ten thousand *li*, unrestrained by rivers and streams, traveling without boats or bridges, riding the clouds and *qi*, hence the phrase.\n\n\"Using dragons as horses and purchasing scholars as chariots\" describes soaring into the azure clouds to follow the Perfected One of Grand Unity. \"At times entering the celestial gate to meet the great host\" means ascending to heaven to see the abodes of the Perfected Ones above, hence the phrase. \"One’s body rivals the sun and moon—wherever one desires to be\": Ingesting the elixir blossom grants immortality, one’s body shining with the same light as the sun and moon. One’s heart’s desires are unrestrained, unbound by heaven and earth or the laws of kings, hence the phrase.\n\n\"Why behold all the worthies and sages arrayed before one?\" describes meeting the Perfected Ones, the Grand Unity, and all the divine immortals, sitting in mutual company, hence the phrase. \"The divine turtle, the paired geese, the divine shrimp at dusk\": Even the celestial divine turtles and shrimps attain immortality. \"Bo Ya plays the zither, jade maidens sing in unison, and green-waisted dancers rise in sorrowful harmony.\" \"Sorrowful harmony\" refers to the Perfected One of Grand Unity leading the revelry with wine.\n\n\"I grieve for my parents’ early death, for they knew not the Dao. Alone, I am vexed and aggrieved—what can be done? My parents and kin have all perished too soon, their pain unrelieved by the medicine.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus the body ingests the divine elixir of flowering cinnabar, and no perverse qi can harm it, nor can illness befall it. To say that consuming the flowering cinnabar cures all ailments is to declare that no sickness will afflict one.\n\nFortunate is the one who attains transcendence—auspicious and without misfortune. \"Auspicious and without misfortune\" means the body endures for ten thousand generations, following the Perfected Ones. Fortunate is the one who transcends the world for ten thousand years and more. If you diligently study this, you too may attain immortality.\n\nExplanation: The method for refining the flowering cinnabar elixir involves taking alum, halite, bittern, and arsenolite—four substances—and first firing them for twenty days. Then, take leftward-turning oysters from the Eastern Sea, red stone, talc, and seven other ingredients, adjusting their quantities as needed. Pound them ten thousand times until they become powder, then place them in an iron vessel and fire them for nine days and nine nights, intensifying the flame until the medicine glows red as fire. Pound it again ten thousand times, sift it through fresh silk, and blend it with well-fermented hundred-day wine to create the \"Six-One Mud.\" Coat the inside and outside of two red clay crucibles with this mud, each layer three fen thick, and dry them in the sun for over ten days until thoroughly desiccated. Then, take lead powder and fire it until it turns golden. Next, take equal parts of dark yellow and yellow substances, mix them with hundred-day Hua Pond liquid to form a paste, pound them ten thousand times, and coat the inside of the two red clay crucibles with a three-fen-thick layer. Apply another three-fen-thick layer to the outside and dry them in the sun for ten days until completely dry.\n\nThen, place two jin of cinnabar into the crucible, adjusting the quantity of medicine as needed—from one jin at the base to ten jin at the top, or even a hundred jin, with no fixed amount. The poor may prepare less, the wealthy more. A crucible large enough to hold eight or nine sheng can accommodate one and a half dou. Those from Rongyang, Henan, Luoyang, and Yingchuan command high prices, with each crucible costing fourteen or fifteen coins. First, coat the crucibles inside and out with Six-One Mud, each layer three fen thick, and dry them in the sun for ten days until thoroughly desiccated before use.\n\nPlace the cinnabar into the crucible and seal it, allowing it to dry for over ten days. Ensure the crucible’s mouth and seams are tightly sealed to prevent any leakage. Before the cinnabar ascends, first heat the crucible with horse dung fire, piling earth around the crucible’s edges with the fire five cun away. \"Tongqing\" refers to horse dung; if unavailable, use chaff fire. Heat it for nine days and nine nights, then push the fire closer for another nine days and nine nights, placing the crucible directly over the flame. For the next nine days and nine nights, mound the fire halfway up the crucible. After a total of thirty-six days of firing, it will be ready. Let it cool for a day, then open it—the cinnabar will have ascended and adhered to the upper crucible. Sweep it off with a rooster’s feather: it will appear purple-red, shimmering with five colors, sometimes like streaking stars or swirling red, other times like frost or snow, or pure red as cinnabar. One jin of this substance yields only four liang.\n\nIf the medicine resists the fire and does not rise, it is called \"flowering cinnabar.\" Blend it with dragon fat, form pellets the size of small beans, and place them over a fierce fire. With bellows, blow on them for the time it takes to cook a meal, and they will turn into gold. If the medicine does not ascend and instead becomes powdered mercury, fire one jin of it with twenty-four zhu, and it too will become gold. Use this to fashion gold and silver plates to hold the medicine. To ingest it, take a pellet the size of a small bean, face the sun, bow twice, and consume it. If the medicine does not submit to the fire, refine it again. Mix it with dark water, dragon fat, and moisture until damp, then place it back into the dark yellow and red clay crucible, seal it properly, and fiercely fire it for another thirty-six days until the medicine is complete. In total, seventy-two days will suffice.\n\nWhen preparing the medicine, begin on an auspicious day such as the first day of the sexagenary cycle, the day of the \"Opening\" or \"Removal\" in the almanac. Before compounding the medicine, fast and purify yourself for three days. No more than two or three people should participate, and they must be of one mind, for \"two in harmony can cut through metal.\" Focus your intent and avoid entering defiled or impure households. When firing the medicine, perform a ritual offering at the crucible’s edge with clear wine, fragrant cakes, a dou of millet, three dou of jujubes, and a dou of pears. Arrange three tables, each with three cups, and as the incense rises, bow twice and pray:\n\n\"Lesser servant so-and-so, on this day, refines the Nine Elixirs. May the divine immortals, the Mysterious Woman, the Plain Woman, and the Green-Waisted Jade Maidens assist in its completion. May the Lord of the Great Dao, Lord Lao, and the Lord of Grand Harmony grant this lesser servant so-and-so the medicine of immortality and the wine of the divine immortals.\"\n\nRise, bow twice, and complete nine bows. Then recite:\n\n\"May the Lord of the Dao and the Mysterious Woman ensure the medicine does not flee, that it submits to the fire, and that its color is fine and good. May it transform at will, yielding both yellow and white. May those who consume it ascend to the Purple Palace, their lives boundless, their rank that of a Perfected One.\"\n\nThen offer the wine. After the wine is presented, offer all manner of red fruits and citrus fruits. When preparing the divine medicine, do not allow fools, women, children, mourners, the impure, or those with sharp tongues and envious hearts to witness it. If they do not follow the Dao, do not let them know of it, lest the medicine fail to form. Take care that no guests or women linger near the medicine. Why? The medicine requires absolute silence to succeed. Fools who doubt the Dao and deny the existence of divine medicines must not see it, or the medicine will not form.\n\nCarefully monitor the crucible to ensure no cracks, holes, or damage—even as small as a hair or an ant’s nose—lest the medicine escape, its spirit vanish, its soul dissipate, leaving only stone behind and squandering its precious essence. The medicine will then be ineffective and offer no benefit to those who consume it. One zhu of the divine medicine, when cast into a jin of mercury and fired, will turn it into gold. If it does not become gold, the medicine is unfit for consumption.\n\nThus the Mysterious Woman said: \"If gold can be made, the world can be transcended. If gold cannot be made, one only harms oneself.\"",

      "translated_text": "Then take one *zhu* of the elixir and grind it with one *jin* each of lead, tin, and mercury—all will transform into gold and silver. Thus it is said: \"A *jin* for a *jin*, and one *zhu*—take care not to exceed this measure.\" Always at dawn, when the sun rises, face east, bow twice, kneel, and ingest it like grain. The superior adept who consumes it will ascend as an immortal among the Nine Sovereigns in seven days. The lesser adept will attain immortality in seventy days. The foolish who take it will achieve it only after a year.\n\nWhen preparing the divine medicine and consuming it, one must first purify through fasting, bathing in five fragrant herbs, and observing the proper rites—without these, the medicine will not form. To refine the elixir in a cinnabar crucible with divine talismans is most excellent. Do not covet wealth; only by refining the divine medicine can one attain immortality. Do not transmit this recklessly.\n\nThe Perfected One said: The second elixir is called the Divine Talisman, born of the surplus of the Great Yang and the River Earl. \"Born of the Great Yang\" refers to mercury, which originates from the Great Yang. The Great Yang is cinnabar, born in *bing* and *ding*. *Bing* and *ding* are the essence of fire, ascending as the Star of Blazing Delusion and descending as cinnabar. Thus it is said to be born in *bing* and *ding*. *Bing* and *ding* reside in the south, the direction of the Great Yang. Therefore, the *Yi* speaks of the \"empty sun\" in the south as the Great Yang. The Great Yang is cinnabar, born of the sun, and the sun is born of fire—fire is the child of the sun.\n\nThe north, *ren* and *gui*, is the Great Yin, and the Great Yin is water. Thus the *Yi* speaks of the \"empty moon\" in the north, where lodestone is born. Lodestone is lead. Its essence ascends as the North Star, born in *kan*. *Kan* resides in the north, while *li* resides in the south. The \"surplus of the River Earl\" is mercury.\n\nTake an unrestricted measure of mercury, place it in a red clay crucible, and refine it with nine ascents and nine descents, blending it with carp gall. Then take another unrestricted measure of mercury, seal and coat it securely as prescribed, and repeat the process of nine ascents and nine descents, blending it with dragon’s fat—this is called the Divine Talisman. Its four thousand companions are azurite, alum, halite, and sulfur, hence the saying \"they accompany it together.\"\n\nThe River Maid, the solitary younger sister,\nWith brows like crescent moons and skin white as luminous pearls.\nThe cinnabar of Changsha, radiant in hue,\nFrom youth steadfast and chaste, needing no husband.\nEast and west, north and south—her parents both present,\nHer body untouched, pure as a pearl.\nShe awaits the worthy scholar who must seek her,\nBold and forthright, her words like scripture.\nAt peace, her talents overflow,\nNever boasting falsely to others.\n\nThe \"River Maid\" is the yellow essence of lead. The \"worthy scholar\" is mercury. \"You illuminate the matchmaker’s role, causing them to dwell together\" means: take one *jin* of the yellow essence of lead, place it in an iron vessel, and heat it with charcoal. Then take seven *jin* of mercury and add it to the lead, firing it intensely. In an instant, their essences rise together, appearing like yellow-gold and purple-red, resembling shooting stars or flowing pearls, in hues of five colors and mysterious yellow. Use an iron spoon to gather it, obtaining nine *jin* of the one—this is the three transformations and nine revolutions, called the Flower of Cinnabar, also known as the Profound Yellow Essence or the Talisman of Heaven and Earth.\n\nRefine mercury with this to form the elixir, called the Returning Cinnabar, or the Divine Elixir of Immortality. The sages guard this secret; it is not for ordinary Daoist practitioners to know. Only the wise and enlightened, those of exceptional insight, can comprehend it. Thus the texts do not exhaust their words, nor do words exhaust their meaning.\n\nTherefore, the scripture says: \"The essence of cinnabar gives birth to the essence of the sun—radiant and luminous.\" The \"child of the sun\" is fire, hence fire is called \"Child Illuminator.\" Mercury is also called \"Child Companion,\" as the *Yi* says. The essence of cinnabar gives birth to the sun, and the Great Yin gives birth to the moon. The moon’s position is in the north at *kan*, its number one—thus knowing the One, all things are complete. The One is lead. The essence of lead gives birth to the moon, and the essence of lead is called the Stone of the Great Yin. It is also named Metal Duke, River Chariot, Old Woman of the River, or Standing Regulator Stone.\n\nFools who prepare the medicine mistakenly use the Standing Regulator Stone from the mountains—this is wrong, a thousand miles from the Dao. The Perfected One transforms the yellow essence of lead into the Standing Regulator Stone and gall, all derived from lead. Foolish commoners, alchemists, and meddlers who prepare the medicine mistakenly use Qiangli gall—this is wrong, a thousand miles from the Dao, and their medicine will not form.\n\nThe Perfected One refines the essence of cinnabar into flowing pearls, frost, and snow, while the essence of lead transforms into the Returning Cinnabar. When yellow and white are achieved, consuming it grants immortality. Without these two substances in the preparation, even if one obtains the elixir and consumes it, they will still die.\n\nThe Great Yin is lead, and the Great Yang is cinnabar. The Great Yin is the position of *kan*, at *zi*. The Great Yang is the position of *li*, at *wu*. Thus *kan* gives birth to the moon, and *li* gives birth to the sun. The sun is the husband, the moon the wife. The sun is male, the moon female. Lodestone and lead belong to the Great Yin, positioned at *zi*, their number one. Cinnabar belongs to the Yang, positioned at *wu*, its number nine. Realgar belongs to earth, its number five. Thus it is said: one, five, nine—fifteen in total—hence the Perfected One calls it the Three-Five. Knowing the Three-Five, one may traverse the world. Those who know the Three-Five and prepare the Returning Cinnabar to consume will attain longevity and immortality—thus they traverse the world.\n\nTherefore, the Perfected One said: \"Knowing the Three Marvels and Six Harmonies, what need is there for anything else?\" Cinnabar is the male, lead the female. Thus the tradition says: \"The father is the Three Marvels, the mother the Six Harmonies. Master this Dao—what need is there for enfeoffment?\" This is its meaning.\n\n\"You illuminate the matchmaker’s role, causing them to dwell together\" means: take nine *jin* of mercury and one *jin* of lead, combine them in a red clay crucible, and fire them intensely from dawn until sunset. The mercury and the essence of lead will emerge together, golden in color—this is called the Profound Yellow Essence, also known as Yellow Sprout or Yellow Light.",

The medicine will then be ineffective and offer no benefit to those who consume it. One zhu of the divine medicine, when cast into a jin of mercury and fired, will turn it into gold. If it does not become gold, the medicine is unfit for consumption.\n\nThus the Mysterious Woman said: \"If gold can be made, the world can be transcended. If gold cannot be made, one only harms oneself.\"",

      "translated_text": "Take the Cinnabar Blossom and infuse it with water—this is called Yellow Pool, also known as Yellow Blossom, Yellow Dragon, or Dark-Restraining Stone. Combine the Profound Yellow with Dark Water, shaping it like a sealed-clay pellet, and place it in a red clay crucible. Seal it with Six-One Mud, both inside and out, to a thickness of three *fen*, then let it dry for ten days without leakage. Fire it with horse dung or chaff for eighty-one days, coinciding with *geng-xin*. *Geng-xin* is the name for yellow gold. The Perfected One guarded this secret, never speaking of \"yellow gold,\" hence writing \"gold\" as *geng-xin*. Take one *dao-gui* of Profound Yellow and place it in intense fire, fanning it with a bellows until, in the time it takes to cook a meal, it all transforms into *geng-xin*. If it fails to become *geng-xin*, the fire will cause the medicine to fly away, and the raw substance cannot be consumed. Return it to the red clay crucible, fire it as before, seal and coat it, and after eighty-one days, the medicine will be ready for use.\n\nProfound Yellow is also called Hidden Cinnabar or Purple Powder. To consume it, always at dawn on a *jia-zi* day, face east toward the sun, bow twice, and swallow a pellet the size of a small bean. Take one pill daily, and after a hundred days, all illnesses will be cured. The Profound Yellow medicine cures severe leprosy and scabies, healing all ailments within a hundred days—there is nothing it cannot treat.\n\n\"You illuminate the matchmaker’s role, causing them to dwell together, yet they refuse to listen and wish to petition\" refers to mercury not yet harmonized with lead. \"Later, they meet the divine husband again\" refers to the mercury. \"You press them\" means applying fire. \"You press them with the red crucible\" means the red clay crucible. \"You\" refers to fire. \"Eventually, they listen to each other, their hues radiant\" describes lead and mercury combining and flying together to form Profound Yellow. \"Radiant hues\" means the medicine’s color is exceptionally fine.\n\n\"The husband comes from without, the wife from within; like fish and water, they attain harmony and depend on each other.\" \"In the four seasons, they bear offspring like divine huts, their five-colored glow over an inch thick\" means that when the male and female essences unite, they no longer fly away. Then, take the Profound Yellow, blend it with the Hundred-Day Blossom Pool until it resembles mud, and coat the inside and outside of two red clay crucibles to a thickness of three *fen*. Place three *jin* of mercury within—up to ten *jin* may be used, depending on the desired quantity of medicine. Flying three *jin* of mercury suffices for one person’s transcendence, as the medicine is potent. Flying one *jin* yields ten *liang*.\n\nTo fly the Profound Yellow: take one *jin* of mercury, place it in a red clay crucible, and cover it with Profound Yellow to a depth of two *cun*. Seal it with another red clay crucible, coating the joint with Six-One Mud as in the Cinnabar Blossom method. Fire it with horse dung or chaff for nine days and nights, and the mercury will all fly upward, adhering to the crucible’s interior like frost or snow, shimmering in purple, red, and five colors—hence the description of a five-colored glow over an inch thick. Brush it off with a feather, then blend it with Yellow *Shu*. If repeating the process, Yellow *Shu* is the gall of a yellow dog. Alternatively, blend it with the River Earl’s Remnant, which is carp gall. Take the carp gall and mix it with the flying frost-and-snow (the mercury’s flying essence), forming a seal like a clay pellet. Return it to a red clay crucible, cover it again with Profound Yellow Essence to a depth of one *cun*, and seal it with another red clay crucible. Coat the joint with Six-One Mud to prevent leakage, then place it in the sun for ten days to thoroughly dry. Only then may it be fired.\n\nFiring must not be done hastily, lest the crucible crack and the great medicine be lost. Fire it again for nine days and nights, then stop. After cooling for a day, open it and brush off the flying essence—crimson and purple—called the Divine Talisman Returning Cinnabar. Blend it with Dragon Grease, forming pellets the size of small beans. At dawn, face east toward the sun, bow twice, kneel, and consume it. After a hundred days, you will be accompanied by divine immortals and jade maidens, moving with the gods as swiftly as flight. To cross rivers and seas, mix the Divine Talisman Cinnabar with Dragon Gall Grease or carp gall, and apply it to the soles of your feet. You may traverse the Yangtze, Yellow River, Huai, Wei, or Ji without wetting your feet or drowning—hence the saying, \"feet remain dry.\" Attaining the Dao and transcending the world, all illnesses leave the body, granting deathlessness and freedom from all ailments.\n\nAfter consuming the medicine for a hundred days, the Three Worms and Three Corpses in the abdomen will all decay and perish. Earth Dragon and fish gall are both yin essences, while mercury is yang essence. Thus, yin can restrain yang, rendering the medicine docile and preventing it from rising. The Perfected, the Divine, and the Immortals guard this secret and do not transmit it.\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"The third elixir is called Divine Cinnabar, its five colors intermingled—truly a sight to behold.\" It originates from the true yang of Wudu’s seclusion, referring to true realgar and orpiment, both produced in Zhengyang Wudu. Wuyang also yields realgar, pure and white, with a fine texture. \"Divine\" means that among the Eight Stones, realgar and orpiment repel weapons, cure all illnesses, and are especially potent. \"Pure and white\" refers to selecting the finest specimens. \"A worthy man’s value is twenty thousand coins\" means that flying realgar and orpiment yields a flying essence worth ten thousand coins per *dao-gui*. \"Their complexions fair, their eyes bright\" describes the flying medicine of realgar and orpiment, producing five splendid colors. \"Roaming at dawn and dusk, halting at famous mountains\" refers to the flying essence adhering to the upper crucible—hence \"halting at famous mountains.\" \"Alchemists dare not seize it\" means that the Daoist uses two red clay crucibles to fly the essence, ensuring it does not escape. \"Take the lower earth and stone\" means collecting the flying essence. The method: take two *jin* of realgar and one *jin* of orpiment, totaling three *jin*. First, soak the medicine in the Blossom Pool to prevent it from scattering and flying away.",

      "translated_text": "After steeping realgar and orpiment for a hundred days, combine them and place in an iron mortar, grinding ten thousand strokes until they become a fine powder. Transfer this into a red clay crucible, covering it with a layer of *xuanhuang* powder one *cun* thick on all sides—top, bottom, and around. Seal with *liuyi* mud to prevent leakage, then dry in the sun for ten days. Next, use horse dung as fuel to fly the medicine for nine days and nine nights, keeping the fire five *cun* from the crucible’s edge. Then, intensify the fire for another nine days and nine nights, gradually moving it beneath the crucible. Strengthen the fire further for nine days and nine nights, then raise it to the crucible’s midpoint, continuing for another nine days and nine nights—totaling thirty-six days in four cycles of nine.\n\nOn the following day, allow it to cool before opening. Sweep the flying essence with a chicken feather, mix it with dragon fat, and fly it again following the method for refining *danhua*. Fire it for three cycles of nine, twenty-seven days in all. The next day, let it cool and open it, sweeping the essence with a chicken feather. This is called *flying essence*, which, when refined into medicine, is named *divine elixir*. When Daoists consume it, they become immortals, achieving transcendence in no more than a hundred days. Even the foolish, if they take it, will ascend in a year—not through the work of ghosts or spirits.\n\nMen and women, common folk and children—all who consume this medicine become immortals. Those who take it and strike it become great spirits. *Ziming* harmonizes the union, for *Ziming* is the fire that unites them. When realgar and orpiment combine with fire to produce flying essence, carefully seal the seams to ensure firmness. Coat the inner and outer surfaces of the red clay crucible with *liuyi* mud, each layer three *fen* thick. First, mix *xuanhuang* with the Blossom Pool liquid to a mud-like consistency, then apply it to both red clay crucibles, ensuring no leakage—this is what is meant by \"ensuring firmness.\"\n\nTake oyster shell, red halloysite, and magnetite—three substances in equal parts—grind each ten thousand strokes into powder, and blend with *zuowei*. First, evenly distribute the Blossom Pool liquid within to prevent moisture or leakage. Then, take the flying essence of realgar and orpiment, mix it with dragon fat, and let the ingredients interact. This refers to refining the nine divine elixirs and flying essence; without dragon fat, the medicine lacks potency. Thus, it is said, \"mix with dragon fat and let the ingredients interact,\" and consuming it grants immortality and longevity for ten thousand years.\n\nIt is said that after consuming the divine elixir for a hundred days, all spirits descend to welcome you: perfected beings, jade maidens, jade lads, the White Maiden, and the Azure Waist, along with the hundred ghosts of mountains, marsh officials, and marsh wardens—all come to serve the Daoist and guide them to transcendence. There is no inherent distinction; even slaves, maidservants, chickens, and dogs can attain immortality. All who consume the medicine achieve this.\n\nOne must dwell in seclusion: to take the divine elixir, reside in a mountain cave, a stone chamber, a great marsh, near a riverside valley, or an empty dwelling. Be cautious not to converse with worldly fools—do not let those who gossip or envy, or those who dislike the Dao, learn of your work. Avoid contact with households involved in burials, weddings, or betrothals. Always sleep alone in a chamber, and the immortal jade maidens will surely descend.\n\nRevere the spirits: when consuming the divine elixir, heavenly spirits, immortals, and jade maidens descend. One must serve them with reverence, contemplate the celestial Dao without negligence, and dwell in a stone chamber near a famous mountain. To refine and consume the elixir, choose a deep marsh or uninhabited place, unseen by worldly eyes. Only by residing in mountain caves and rocky seclusion can one obtain the divine elixir and ascend to heaven. Once the divine elixir is complete, the entire household becomes immortal. Officials, chickens, and dogs rise amid the azure clouds—yet in the world, such prosperity is rare and departure difficult. Worldly people, greedy for wealth, refuse to refine the divine elixir, instead consuming herbal medicines and practicing *daoyin*, only to die without longevity. Thus, departure is exceedingly difficult.\n\nHerbal medicines can cure a hundred illnesses but cannot grant long life or immortality. Why? Herbs rot when buried and char when boiled; if they cannot preserve themselves, how can they grant humans longevity? The Perfected One said: The fourth elixir is called *Returning Elixir*, and nine brothers may share it. The \"nine\" refers to the nine substances used to line the crucible. Take stalactite, alum, hematite, halite, oyster shell, red halloysite, *tulongji*, mica, and talc—nine substances in all. Burn each for a day and a night with intense fire, then grind them into powder. Mix with fermented liquid to a mud-like consistency and use it to coat the inner and outer surfaces of the clay crucible, each layer five *fen* thick. Let it dry in the shade for ten days.\n\nThen place mercury in the crucible, cover it with realgar, followed by azurite, alum, sulfur, bittern, *taiyi yuyuliang*, and stalactite—with stalactite alone on top. Each of the seven substances is processed separately into powder. Place one *jin* of mercury at the bottom, layering the rest in order. Seal the crucible with *liuyi* mud mixed with fine fermented liquid, ensuring no leakage, and dry in the sun for ten days. Place it on five iron pillars, nine *cun* high, and heat with horse dung or chaff fire, keeping it five *cun* from the crucible’s base. Maintain a gentle fire for nine days and nine nights, then increase the fire to the crucible’s midpoint for another nine days and nine nights. Continuously cover the crucible with damp cloth to prevent the medicine from flying away; rewet the cloth when it dries. Following the method for refining *danhua*, after eighty-one days in nine cycles of nine, the medicine will ascend and adhere, forming five colors. Sweep it with a chicken feather, mix with a hundred flower essences and well water, and consume one *dao-gui*. Lie in a stone chamber, and one will no longer hunger or thirst for a hundred years. When thirsty, drink from a stone spring; when hungry, eat twenty dates or chestnuts. Remain tranquil and contemplate the divine medicine. Take it once daily, and after a hundred days, vermilion phoenixes will soar above you, and jade maidens will arrive.",

      "translated_text": "After two hundred days of consuming the medicine, immortals will accompany you on your journeys. After one year, the Great One will come to receive you. If you use the returned elixir to coat coins for market transactions, the coins will all return to you. If you write with the elixir on your eyelids while lying down, evil spirits will all flee. One *dao-gui* of powder mixed with a catty of mercury, when fired, immediately transforms into yellow gold. It must be blended with dragon’s fat and refined for nine days and nine nights to become true yellow gold.\n\n*The Scripture of the Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls and the Nine Elixirs of Divine Immortals, Scroll the Upper, concludes here.*\n*The Scripture of the Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls and the Nine Elixirs of Divine Immortals, Scroll the Lower.*\n*Transmitted by the Perfected One of Great Clarity*\n\nThe Perfected One’s Divine Water Method:\nThe Perfected One said: The fifth elixir is called *Er Dan* (\"Edible Elixir\"). It originated with a scholar from Wuling in Changsha, a man of the Taiyi Xunshi and the Zhu clan. The \"man of the Zhu clan\" refers to mercury. The \"scholar from Wuling\" refers to realgar. The \"Taiyi Xunshi\" refers to *yuyugen* (limonite). Take one catty of mercury and one catty of realgar, grind them into powder, and place the mercury on top. Take one catty of *yuyugen*, grind it into powder, and place it atop the realgar. Seal them in an earthen crucible, joining two crucibles at their mouths and sealing them with Six-One Mud. Allow it to dry, then fire it with horse dung or chaff for nine days and nine nights. Then refine it with charcoal fire for another nine days and nine nights, and the medicine will all ascend and adhere to the upper crucible. *Ziming* is the catalyst, and the \"worthy scholar\" is gold. Both are combined with mercury, mixed with *tianxiong* (aconite), and blended with dragon’s fat and equal parts of Shaoshi human male essence.\n\nThe \"Divine Sparrow Child\" refers to a chicken egg. Consuming one *dao-gui* will suddenly transport you ten thousand *li* away, allowing you to cross rivers and seas. If taken for no more than thirty days, one will gain the ability to fly within that time. All spirits will come and go to guard your left and right, with ten thousand spirits attending and serving you. Jade maidens and green-waisted attendants will be at your command. You will ride a spontaneous chariot and ascend to heaven. Accompanied by jade maidens, all the gods of the world will serve you, and the spirits of the hundred deities, village altars, and state sacrifices—along with the Wind Earl and Rain Master—will all come to attend you. Thus, it is called the \"Fifth Elixir, the Mother,\" and is also named *Er Dan*.\n\nThe Perfected One said: The sixth elixir is called *Lian Dan* (\"Refined Elixir\"), which is subtly wondrous and revered by all divine immortals. It comes from the distant lands of the Man and Yi tribes in Ba and Yue. It is said that Yue cinnabar originates from the Yue countryside in Ba Commandery. Choose specimens with eyes like pearls and mouths like cinnabar—those that are fresh and bright. The worthy do not take it from among the people; instead, they use earthworm fat and the flying essence of the Eight Stones. For thirty days, the stones are refined for thirty days. The Eight Stones are: Ba cinnabar, Yue cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, *zengqing* (azurite), alum, magnetite, and chalcanthite. Combine equal parts of these eight substances as the medicine, adjusting quantities as needed. Blend them with dragon’s fat and one *dou* of earthworm fat, then mix with the gallbladder of a yellow dog and two *dou* of earthworm fat to form the crucible. Use three catties each of oyster shell and red halloysite, grinding them into powder with left-flavored saliva. The \"left flavor\" refers to fermented rice liquid. Mix them into a mud and coat the inside and outside of the earthen crucible to a thickness of three *fen*. Harmonize *Ziming* and adjust until it can be formed into pills. Use a small fire and seal the crucible’s seams with mud to prevent leakage. When the Eight Stones ascend, they will adhere like frost and snow, their essence and color resembling such. Blend them with dragon’s fat, and the resulting pills will be the size of small beans, suitable for consumption. Once the yellow and white (gold and silver) are formed, the medicine is complete and can be used to create gold and silver. All spirits will respectfully heed your commands, and the hundred ghosts and gods will all be at your service. After consuming it, one may fast for ten days. Not only men but women may also take it. Women who consume it will likewise become flying immortals. To practice grain avoidance, one must abstain from the Five Grains and drink only water, eliminating all distracting thoughts. If one engages in sexual relations with women, the Dao will certainly not be achieved. When preparing the medicine, avoid sweetness, bitterness, and regret, for if the body becomes tainted, it will be difficult to remedy.\n\nGrind each of the Eight Stones separately into powder. Place Ba cinnabar and Yue cinnabar at the bottom, followed by realgar, then orpiment, then *zengqing*, then alum, then chalcanthite, and finally magnetite at the top. Seal them in an earthen crucible, joining two crucibles and sealing them with Six-One Mud. Coat the seams with oyster shell and red halloysite, then refine them with horse dung or chaff fire, following the method for refining *danhua*. Refine them for thirty days, collect the ascended essence, blend it with dragon’s fat, and form pills the size of small beans. Consume them after meals, and the residue can be used to treat all illnesses, with divine efficacy.\n\nThe Perfected One said: The seventh elixir is called *Rou Dan* (\"Supple Elixir\"), which resembles *Er Dan* but is smoother and easier to consume. Take three catties of mercury, first blend it with *xuanhuang* (mysterious yellow) and left-flavored liquid to form a mud, and coat the inside and outside of the crucible to a thickness of three *fen*. Place the mercury inside, seal it with Six-One Mud, and ensure no leakage. Allow it to dry for ten days, then refine it following the method for *danhua* for twenty days. Collect the ascended essence and blend it with dragon’s fat. If one desires children, blend it with *quepen* (broken basin herb). When a ninety-year-old man consumes it, his yang qi will greatly strengthen, and he may father children again. If one uses *Rou Dan* to anoint the spirit tablets of ancestral spirits, the tablets will become imbued with divine power. If one writes with *Rou Dan* on the bodies of servants, they will not dare to flee. When an eighty-year-old woman consumes it, she may bear children again. When an official consumes it, he will be promptly promoted.",
      "overlap_context": "cine will ascend and adhere, forming five colors. Sweep it with a chicken feather, mix with a hundred flower essences and well water, and consume one *dao-gui*. Lie in a stone chamber, and one will no longer hunger or thirst for a hundred years. When thirsty, drink from a stone spring; when hungry, eat twenty dates or chestnuts. Remain tranquil and contemplate the divine medicine. Take it once daily, and after a hundred days, vermilion phoenixes will soar above you, and jade maidens will arrive.",

      "translated_text": "The method for refining the elixir follows the *danhua* process, and the sage who observes purification rites will attain great divinity. Those who govern others are true persons. Without purification rites, the elixir will lack divine power. One must seek the River Maiden for marriage to obtain named lead. The River Maiden is mercury, which, when united with lead in essence, can produce gold and silver, mutually perfecting one another. For those who wish to bear descendants, no elixir will fail to form, and no transformation will remain unachieved. It grants immortality and the attainment of transcendence.\n\nThe True Person said: The eighth elixir is called *Fudan* (Subduing Elixir), its color a deep blackish-purple, yet it gathers the five hues. It can restrain ghosts and repel villains. When written with this elixir on doors and gates, it slays malevolent spirits and wards off thieves. The method for its preparation: use a red earthen crucible or a *longji* crucible, coating the inside and outside with *xuanhuang* or lead to a thickness of three *fen*. Seal it with Six-One Mud, ensuring no leakage. Place mercury inside the crucible, seal it, and allow it to dry. Refine it with horse dung or chaff fire for nine days and nine nights. Then, invert the crucible so the upper becomes the lower, and refine it again for nine days and nine nights. Repeat this inversion nine times, alternating upper and lower, until the elixir is complete. Collect the ascended essence, blend it with dragon’s fat, and refine it again for ten days. The ascended portion, when processed, resembles powder. Store it in a vessel of gold, silver, or fresh bamboo. At dawn, face east, bow twice, kneel, and consume one *daogui* with well-water drawn at dawn. This grants transcendence. A piece the size of a jujube pit, carried in one’s headscarf, will cause all ghosts to vanish and dare not approach. It strengthens the hun and po souls, allowing one to dwell alone in a stone chamber and attain transcendence. Tigers and wolves will naturally avoid one. If a woman lives alone and holds a piece the size of a soybean, all ghosts will depart, and thieves will not dare approach.\n\nThe method for preparing the elixir: take one *jin* of mercury, adjusting the quantity as desired. Seal it following the *dan* method, coating with Six-One Mud. Two earthen crucibles may be used, or a crucible coated with *xuanhuang*, or a Luoyang red earthen crucible, or a lead-powder crucible, with size adjusted as needed. Blend with dragon’s fat and refine for three days. Collect the ascended portion, which will be snow-white. Blend it again with dragon’s fat for ten days. When the elixir is complete, process it as in the *danhua* method. Four agents nurture one mother: *cengqing*, magnetite, *yushi*, and *xuanhuang* are placed atop it.\n\nThe True Person said: The ninth elixir is called *Handan* (Cold Elixir). Its method takes gold and silver as the foundation, using them as the primary metal. The five agents gather in equal measure. The five minerals are mercury, realgar, orpiment, *cengqing*, *yushi*, and magnetite. Take one *jin* each of the five divine agents and two *jin* of mercury, processing them separately. Grind the five agents into powder and place them in the crucible. First coat the crucible with *xuanhuang*, then add *liuzhu* (flowing pearls) to the crucible. Layer realgar over the mercury, followed by orpiment, *cengqing*, *yushi*, and magnetite, with magnetite on top. Seal two earthen crucibles together with Six-One Mud, ensuring no leakage. Mix equal parts dragon’s saliva and yellow earth to form mud, then remove the earth. First coat the crucible’s seams with *muli* and *chishizhi* mud to a thickness of three *fen*, then coat the exterior with dragon’s saliva and yellow earth to the same thickness. Allow it to dry for ten days. Refine it with *Ziming*’s method, using gentle fire. The divine elixir will ascend and adhere like stalactites. Refine it for nine days and nine nights, then collect the ascended elixir, sweeping it with a rooster’s feather. Blend it with dragon’s fat or the gallbladder of a yellow dog. Consuming it lightens the body, and after a hundred days, all illnesses are cured. The Azure Waist Attendant commands, and the Jade Maiden of Destiny records one’s name in the registers of the transcendent’s abyssal palace. It is said that consuming the Returning Elixir for a hundred days erases one’s name from the ledgers of the living and the dead, inscribing it in the records of immortals. One may come and go without question, unbound by restraints, able to vanish while seated or standing. It grants the power to ascend and fly to the heavens, traversing ten thousand *li* in an instant upon floating clouds. One may abandon wife and children, never to return.\n\nThe method for the ninth elixir follows the *danhua* process. The earthen crucibles, sealing, mud coating, and firing methods are all the same. The fire should begin gently and later intensify. For the first nine days, use gentle fire, then increase its strength. The crucible’s coating must be thoroughly dried, and the longer it is fired, the better. If the crucible cracks like a hair, the elixir will escape. When processing all mud-based elixirs, grind them thoroughly into fine powder and sift them. Mixing with *zuowei* is beneficial. *Dami* wine is also called the Flowery Pool. It is best gathered on the fifth day of the fifth month or the seventh day of the seventh month, though the fifth day of the fifth month is optimal. Dragon’s fat and dragon’s saliva are the dew on mulberry leaves. To collect them, wipe with silk and wring out the liquid.\n\nThe Nine Tripods are the nine elixirs. Eighty-one chapters derive from one elixir; those who attain it ascend to the Great Clarity. Through fire, the elixir transforms naturally, with agents mutually aiding and depending on one another. The Dao of water and fire is most divine. The ancestors of the nine clans begin with water. Metal and wood unite as husband and wife, while the sun, moon, and stars rely on yin and yang. When essence gathers, fire reigns supreme. My surname is Lingyang, and my style is Ziming. I strike down the Hu barbarians and punish the powerful, extending my reach to Ba and Yue, encroaching upon Yuzhang. The four barbarians submit and unite at the center. The three yin forces restrain one another, and the soft overcomes the strong. The Azure Dragon and White Tiger soar east and west, while the Vermilion Phoenix and Scarlet Bird blaze brilliantly. The twelve-tiered tower of gold holds within it the Dark Warrior, the divine tortoise leading the chorus. Five-colored curtains drape the jade chamber, where the True Person ascends to the Nine Emperors. Roaming the Great Clarity and the Hall of Light, their radiant essence leaps forth like snow and frost. Those who know this elixir become lords of immortals.\n\nThe True Person said: The *Huagai* (Canopy) is the yellow essence of lead. When realgar is added, it can cover the elixir of male transcendents.",

      "translated_text": "Lead is the Canopy, referring to divine water, hence called \"lead’s yellow essence.\" When crafting lead water, it begins with the yellow essence, thus the name is derived from its origin. When realgar’s yellow essence is mentioned, it refers to flying lead becoming frost-like, hence the name is tied to its origin. When it speaks of realgar, it means \"flying,\" thus the term *xiong* (male/realgar). The reason it speaks of \"entering\" is that lead is the Great Yang; when it meets yin, it enters and merges with the yellow essence. Thus, it is said to \"enter.\"\n\nThe reason it speaks of \"covering the elixir of male transcendents\" is that these two essences merge in primordial chaos, enveloping the flowing pearl to preserve the spirit and prevent its departure. Thus, \"covering\" means yin embracing yang. Therefore, \"covering the male\" refers to lead. The reason it is called an \"immortal elixir\" is that lead transforms into cinnabar, the medicine of immortality.\n\nFor fine realgar, take one *jin*. Use two yellow clay crucibles, place the realgar inside one, and cover it with the other. Seal the seam with white dog’s hair mixed into mud, applying a layer three *fen* thick. Alternatively, use red halloysite, oyster shell powder, or limestone ash as sealant, ensuring no leaks. Let it dry in the shade for seven days, or even several tens of days for better results. Heat it with reed firewood. Before burning, inspect the crucible for fine cracks and reseal them. Before heating, fashion three mud sparrows. Place one on the crucible; when it dries, remove it and replace it with another. After the third sparrow dries, the medicine is ready. Remove the crucible and let it cool. Regulate the fire—neither too fierce nor too weak—so the medicine rises to the crucible’s lid, appearing ethereal, like frost or snow, with stalactite-like formations. If the medicine is not fully refined, repeat the firing as before, resealing the crucible as needed.\n\nOnce refined, take seven feathers from the left wing of a three-year-old white rooster and sweep the medicine into a bronze vessel or tray. Then, take two hundred *jin* of pig intestines, wash them thoroughly, and wipe them clean with cloth. Place the medicine inside, tie the ends tightly, and set it in a steamer. Place cooked rice on top, along with one *hu* and five *dou* of millet—or two *hu* if unavailable, or even one *shi*. Steam it. If the intestines rupture, add another layer on top. After one night, add another intestine, steaming for three days and three nights, using three intestines in total. The medicine will then be ready for shaping into pills.\n\nForm the pills into the size of a crossbow pellet. After three days of ingestion, the Three Worms will die. After ten days, the corpse will descend, and at night, a glow will be visible. Refine the medicine further into sesame-sized pills. At dawn, face east, bow twice, and ingest them. On cloudy days, take them toward the sunrise. After a hundred days, even in winter, a single layer of clothing will suffice, and the Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist will arrive. Beware of taking a wife; instead, nurture the Jade Maiden to seek the Dao.\n\nAfter a hundred and fifty days, the Jade Maiden will depart, and another will come, adorned with a jade hairpin on her nose, as large as a millet grain—this is the true Jade Maiden. Beware of marriage. One must remain humble, avoiding foul, rank, or impure places. How could a sage deign to descend to such?\n\nThe Jade Maiden said: \"I saw you consume the divine medicine, and your radiant essence appeared in the heavens. Thus, I have come to be your wife.\" Beware of marriage. She then spoke of the solitary and ignorant, of jade blossoms and jade wine, of the Five Emperors’ Flowery Pond and the Yang of the Celestial Springs—things never tasted, only obtained by sages. The Jade Maiden then retrieved them, and after drinking, you will roam the Six Directions together, ascend the Celestial Pass, and meet the sages. At night, you will descend the Celestial Pass to dwell with the True Person in the Pure Subtlety. Why seek the name of immortality? You will transcend the mortal realm, entering and exiting without obstruction.\n\nAt this time, observe a twelve-year period of strict purification. The Jade Maiden is the daughter of the Heavenly Emperor. The one you nurture is the daughter of the White Emperor. The Azure-Waisted one is the daughter of the Wind Earl. If you wish to roam freely, crossing rivers and seas at will for ten thousand generations, remain ever constant.\n\nAnother method states: When Wu Du realgar is refined, it should resemble silver. If it dries, mix it with honey. Daoists must always observe purification rites.",

After three days, they will dissolve into water, and the medicine will be complete, called Divine Water.\n\nThis Divine Water enables one to enter and exit without obstruction and command a hundred ghosts.\n\nThe method of ingestion: Mix one cup of clear wine with half a *ge* of Divine Water and drink it. In a secluded, tranquil place, after one day, the three worms in the abdomen will all be expelled. Then, partake of fine foods for fifteen days before drinking another small cup of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine. After two days, a three-foot-tall person will appear before you. Say, \"Excellent! But do not speak with them at length, or the matter will not succeed.\" Then, partake of fine foods for another fifteen days before drinking one and a half cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine. After three days, even a team of four horses will be unable to catch you. After another fifteen days, drink two cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine, and your aspirations will soar, your sight and hearing sharpen. After another fifteen days, drink two and a half cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine, and white hair will turn black again, fallen teeth regrow. After another fifteen days, drink three cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine, and the elderly will become youths; on *jiǎzǐ* and *jiǎxū* days, spirits will arrive. After another fifteen days, drink three and a half cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine. After another fifteen days, drink four cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine; on *jiǎshēn* and *jiǎwǔ* days, spirits will arrive, the *Sea Chart* will appear, and you will enter and exit without obstruction. After another fifteen days, drink five cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine; on *jiǎchén* and *jiǎyín* days, spirits will arrive, and the *Sun and Moon Chart* will appear. After another fifteen days, drink six cups of Divine Water with one cup of clear wine, and you will neither sleep nor lie down. The *Chart of Heaven and Earth* will arrive, the Five Flowers will all come, you will cast no shadow, your calls will draw no echo, and you will be formless and indistinct, rising and sinking with heaven and earth. This is a secret—do not transmit it recklessly.\n\nTo compound the medicine, use the Immortal’s *Fèng Gāng* method. On the first day of the first month, take one *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it. On the second day of the second month, take one *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it. On the third day of the third month, take one *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it. On the fourth day of the fourth month, take one *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it. On the fifth day of the fifth month, take one *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it. Seal and coat the containers, and each month, after collecting the water and flowers, reseal them to prevent leakage, storing them in a cold, dark place. From the sixth to the eighth month, whenever there are flowering plants, place them into the water without adding more water, mixing them into the existing infusion. On the ninth day of the ninth month, take another *dou* of water and place all living flowers and plants into it, then transfer it to a white jar, seal it tightly to prevent leakage, and store it in a cold place. Bury it indoors, three *chi* deep into the earth, and after a hundred days, all will dissolve. On a *wáng* day, simmer it over a gentle fire with a bundle of reeds, using bamboo for fuel, until it can be formed into pills. This medicine can revive the dead, transform forms, and alter bodies, allowing one to become a flying immortal. If a person has died and their breath is gone, place this medicine into their mouth, and they will revive.\n\nIf, after the prescribed days, the various ingredients have not dissolved, remove the dregs and mix them with *fú líng* and jujube paste, then take three pills the size of large soybeans at once, one dose per day, without missing a day.\n\nImmortal Lǚ Gōng, styled Wénjìng, received the *Reviving the Dead* formula. It is said that Gōng left home for over two hundred years, and all his descendants had died. Upon his return, he exhumed the dead and applied the medicine to them, and they all revived with flesh and became human again, speaking clearly without error—over a hundred dead were brought back to life.\n\nThe formula: On the first day of the first month, take five *jīn* of bamboo roots. On the second day of the second month, take five *jīn* of pine roots. On the third day of the third month, take five *jīn* of parasol roots. On the fourth day of the fourth month, take five *jīn* of *rěn dōng* roots. On the fifth day of the fifth month, take five *jīn* of *mài mén dōng* roots. On the sixth day of the sixth month, take five *jīn* of *tiān mén dōng* roots. Add one *liǎng* each of three types of cinnamon, five *liǎng* of realgar, and three *liǎng* of ginseng. Wash all the roots well, dry them in the shade, then grind them into fine powder and sift them into a white jar, sealing it tightly to prevent leakage. After a hundred days, open the seal. On a *wáng xiàng* day, purify yourself in a separate room where no one can see, and pound the mixture fifty thousand times. Place it in an oilcloth bag, wrapping it in silk. Take a square-inch spoonful five times a day, always at dawn, noon, dusk, the hour of *réndìng*, and the hour of *jīmíng*, using clear wine. After eating, consume five jujubes, maintain purity of mind, and after a hundred days, you will attain the Dao.\n\nIf you wish to transform and act freely, you must obtain the *Qīng Shé Zú* (Green Snake’s Foot) from a journey in the fifth month. Without this medicine, transformation is impossible. This medicine revives flesh on white bones. Daoists who ingest it will prolong their years, prevent their hair from turning white, their teeth from falling out, and their faces from losing luster. Their essence will be full, their bones strengthened, and they will abstain from grains without hunger or thirst. Poisons will not harm them, their spirits will always be joyful, and whatever they summon will arrive, whatever they dismiss will depart. They can summon wind and rain, command thunderbolts, enter water without sinking, and walk through fire without melting. Blades cannot pierce them, blades cannot wound them. They can ride clouds and travel without bounds, cure all illnesses, summon traveling kitchens, command ten thousand ghosts, and know their thoughts, instantly controlling them. As long as one obtains the method, there is nothing in the world that cannot be achieved.\n\nFor a dead person lying on the ground, use a knife to open their mouth and place five spoonfuls of the medicine into it, and they will revive in a moment.",

      "translated_text": "To perform transformations, take the afterbirth of a firstborn son born on the fifth day of the fifth month. If the medicine is compounded in abundance, two people may obtain it.\n\nZhi (fungi/immortality herbs) come in many kinds: mushroom zhi, herbaceous zhi, woody zhi, and flesh zhi. They commonly grow on high mountains, beneath large trees, and beside spring waters. Mushroom zhi appear in five colors: red ones resemble cinnabar, black ones like fine lacquer, white ones like frost and snow, yellow ones like refined gold, green ones like the head feathers of a drake, purple ones like newly dyed purple silk, and crimson ones like peach blossoms. To determine whether it is true zhi, dry it in the shade for a hundred days—if its color remains unchanged, it is genuine.\n\nWhen entering famous mountains to gather zhi and herbs, one must first purify through fasting. Do not enter the homes of the bereaved or those where a woman has recently given birth, and abstain from pungent and meaty foods. Wear white garments, carry a white chicken, and hold a peck of white salt; alternatively, lead a white dog, and you will surely encounter zhi. Zhi may have two, three, four, or even five layers, with the most potent having nine layers. All can be consumed to attain immortality, allowing one to fly, see through all things, and command ghosts and spirits.\n\nThe method for gathering zhi is as follows: In spring, during the first, second, and third months, do not enter the mountains on *yin-mao* (寅卯) or *jia-yi* (甲乙) days. In summer, during the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, avoid *si-wu* (巳午) or *bing-ding* (丙丁) days. In autumn, during the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, do not enter on *shen-you* (申酉) or *geng-xin* (庚辛) days. In winter, during the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, avoid *hai-zi* (亥子) or *ren-gui* (壬癸) days.\n\nTo gather green zhi, go at dawn on *jia-yi* days when the sun rises, approaching from the east. Cut it with a wooden knife and store it in nine feet of green silk. For red zhi, go at mid-morning or noon on *bing-ding* days, approaching from the south. Cut it with a fish knife and store it in eight feet of crimson silk. For yellow zhi, go at dusk on *wu-ji* days, approaching from the northwest. Cut it with a metal knife and store it in one foot of yellow silk. For black zhi, go at midnight on *ren-gui* days, approaching from the north. Cut it with a bone knife and store it in five feet of black silk. For white zhi, go at sunset on *geng-xin* days, approaching from the west. Cut it with a wooden knife and store it in six feet of white silk.\n\nFlesh zhi include thousand-year-old bats, thousand-year-old spirit turtles, thousand-year-old swallows, and thousand-year-old swans. Consuming them grants immortality. A thousand-year-old bat is pure white and roosts upside down; eating it raw confers immortality. A thousand-year-old spirit turtle has horns on its head and a luminous shell with five-colored flames. Roast its shell, grind it into powder, and take a square-inch spoonful three times daily to become immortal. A thousand-year-old swallow nests facing north; eating it grants immortality. A thousand-year-old swan sings once every two hours, day and night, and is smaller than an ordinary swan. Roast its bones, grind them into powder, and take a square-inch spoonful three times daily to become immortal.\n\n*The Divine Immortal Recipes of Huainan* states: Things take form according to their kind—stalactites differ from pine mistletoe, which differs from mulberry mistletoe. This is the natural Dao of growth. Thus, when consumed, they harmonize with the six pitch-pipes and correspond to the seven stars.\n\nRehmannia root is the essence of the indistinct and imperceptible. Mulberry mistletoe is the essence of yang. Chrysanthemum blossoms are the essence of yin. Poria is the essence of wood. Plantago seeds are the essence of thunder and lightning. Kochia seeds are the essence of the constellations. Bamboo seeds are the essence of celestial blossoms and the Great One. These seven substances correspond to the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, encompassing the sun, moon, and five phases. When consumed in measured proportions, after nine days of purification, on the kingly days of the four seasons, take a pinch with three fingers of well-flower water, facing the sun. Drink once on yang days and twice on yin days. After forty-nine days, one will suddenly vanish.\n\nIn the first year of the Tianfeng era, Chen Yongbo of Nanyang had his nephew consume this medicine. After twenty-eight days, he suddenly disappeared without a trace. Yongbo took it himself and vanished after twenty-eight days, his whereabouts unknown. Yongbo’s son, Zengzhi, aged seventy-eight, along with his uncles and brothers, tested the medicine while bound by ropes. After twenty-eight days, they too vanished. The original recipe required forty-nine days for the transformation, but the timing was uncertain, so afterward, no one dared to consume it again.",
