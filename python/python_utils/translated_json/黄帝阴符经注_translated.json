  "full_translation": "**Huangdi Yin Fu Jing – Zhang Guo’s Annotations on the Huangdi Yin Fu Jing**\n**Chapter Fifteen: Three Caverns Scripture and Teachings Division · Scripture of the Sixth Fast**\n\n**Preface to Knowing the *Yin Fu***\n\nThe *Yin Fu* originated with the Yellow Emperor—indeed, the Sage embodied the Heavenly Dao’s subtle workings.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\n*\"He who seizes the mechanism thrives through ten thousand transformations, ascending to kingship;\nHe who loses it declines through ten thousand transformations, descending to ruin.\"*\n\nLater, Yi and Lu grasped but its remnants, yet still sufficed to save the living—how much more so the Sage!\n\nIts text is concise; its meaning profound.\nThe teachings of earlier sages, though many, obscure and reveal each other in turn.\nLater scholars struggle to master it; even those who claim mastery are like climbers without a ladder to the heavens.\n\nIn recent times, Li Qin falsely attributed his work to sorcerers and demons, composing annotations that merely interweave human affairs, distorting the source.\nThough unworthy to peer through the bamboo tube, I dare present my shallow insights.\nThus, the petty may steal a glimpse and presume to grasp Heaven’s mechanism—alas!\n\nI, your humble servant, though foolish, have always believed otherwise.\n\n「Morning I wish to hear of the Dao, evening I die without regret—\nI chanced upon *The Obscure Symbols Classic* within the Daoist scriptures,\nunknown whose hand crafted it in what age.\n\nIts words and logic are profound and boundless,\nas if sealed with the very essence of Nature.\n\nThus I compiled it, appending my own commentary.\nI hope that future virtuous scholars will not lose the Dao’s intent.\n\n---\n**The Obscure Symbols Classic of the Yellow Emperor — Attributed to Zhang Guo**\n\nThe Classic states:\n*\"To observe the Dao of Heaven, to grasp its actions—\nthis exhausts the art of observation.\"*\n\nTo observe the Dao of Nature, there is nothing to observe.\nYet one does not observe it with the eyes alone,\nbut with the heart.\n\nThe heart is deep and subtle, seeing nothing it cannot perceive,\nthus able to illuminate Nature’s essence.\nThis essence, though profound and subtle, can be discerned—\nthis is what is meant by **\"Obscure\"**.\n\nTo grasp Nature’s actions, there is nothing to grasp.\nThus one does not grasp them with the hands alone,\nbut with the **\"mechanism\"** (*机*).\n\nThe mechanism is fluid and adaptable, bound to no fixed thing,\nthus able to align with Nature’s principles.\nOnly that which is fluid and adaptable can align—\nthis is what is meant by **\"Symbol\"**.\n\nTo illuminate with the heart and align with the mechanism—\nthus the meaning of **\"Obscure Symbols\"** is complete.\n\nLi Qin takes **\"Obscure\"** as **\"darkness\"** and **\"Symbol\"** as **\"harmony\"**,\nplacing this text as a preface—\nhow utterly misguided!\n\n---\n**Heaven’s Five \"Bandits\" — those who see them flourish**\n\nThe Five \"Bandits\" are:\n**command** (*命*), **things** (*物*), **timing** (*时*), **achievement** (*功*), and **spirit** (*神*).\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The Sage’s wisdom\npursues the grand while neglecting the trivial,\nrefines the jade yet conceals no flaws.\nThus, when dwelling in peace, they follow the Dao and manifest virtue to transform it;\nwhen facing peril, they employ expedient means and unleash the mechanism to save it.\nTheir aim is to rectify Heaven and Earth,\ntheir strategy to benefit all humanity.\nHence, they use great righteousness to eliminate the world’s calamities,\ngreat benevolence to promote the world’s benefits,\nultimate justice to redress its wrongs,\nand absolute fairness to curb its selfishness—\nthus, their plans that invert the scriptures yet harmonize with the Dao\nare named in five ways; the Sage transcends them,\nand so they are called **\"Bandits\"**.\nYet the world relies upon them,\nand so they are called **\"virtue/power\"** (*德*).\n\nThus:\n**The Bandit of command** (*贼天之命*), though seen as Heaven’s will,\nthe people do not recognize it as a Bandit—\nthis is why the Yellow Emperor succeeded the Yan Emperor.\n\n**The Bandit of things** (*贼天之物*), though seen as Heaven’s will,\nthe people do not recognize it as a Bandit—\nthis is why Yao succeeded the Zhi Emperor.\n\n**The Bandit of timing** (*贼天之时*), though seen as Heaven’s will,\nthe people do not recognize it as a Bandit—\nthis is why Shun succeeded Yao.\n\n**The Bandit of achievement** (*贼天之功*), though seen as Heaven’s will,\nthe people do not recognize it as a Bandit—\nthis is why Great Yu succeeded Shun.\n\n**The Bandit of spirit** (*贼天之神*), though seen as Heaven’s will,\nthe people do not recognize it as a Bandit—\nthis is why Tang of the Shang overthrew the Xia mandate,\nand King Wu of the Zhou overthrew the Shang mandate.\n\nThus, those who perceive them prosper—\nprosperity comes naturally.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou likened the Bandits to **\"the five flavors\"** (*五味*), using them as a metaphor.\nLi Qin fails to comprehend,\nmisinterpreting the Yellow Emperor’s Bandit of command as the **\"seduction of a maiden\"** (*少女之命*), and the **\"midday ascent\"** (*白日上腾*) as unnatural.\n\n---\n**The Five Bandits lie within the heart, their execution in Heaven;\nThe universe lies within the hands, ten thousand transformations arise from the body.**\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The establishment of virtue is clear,\nthe employment of mechanism is subtle—\nunleashed within, revealed without—\nthis is all.\"*\n\nHow could one brandish arms and wage raids for chaos?\nTo see the mechanism and grasp it,\nthough the universe be vast,\nit does not depart from the span of one’s hands—\nwhat of lesser things?\n\nTo know the spirit and embody it,\nthough myriad things abound,\nthey cannot escape one’s understanding—\nwhat of fewer things?\n\nNature’s creative force is mine—\nis this not magnificent?\nIs this not grand?\n\nLi Qin and his ilk take the Five Bandits as the five flavors,\nclaiming that following them leads to immortality and Daoist transcendence—\nhow they pervert the Dao most grievously!\n\n---\n**Heaven’s nature is humanity; humanity’s heart is the mechanism.\nThe Dao of Heaven establishes humanity.**\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Humanity is Heaven’s nature, the mechanism is humanity’s heart.\nHumanity’s nature is inherently aligned with the subtle and profound—\nthus the Sage can embody the Five Bandits.\"*\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism,\ndragons and serpents rise from the land;\nwhen humanity unleashes the killing mechanism,\nHeaven and Earth invert.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Heaven’s mechanism expands yet does not create life,\nHeaven’s mechanism relaxes yet does not cause death.\nHeaven has expansion and relaxation,\nits use has both affirmation and negation.\nWhen expanded, the killing威 is unleashed;\nwhen relaxed, the killing威 ceases.\nHumanity’s mechanism is likewise so.\n\nHeaven wields *qi* as its威,\nhumanity wields *virtue/power* (*德*) as its mechanism.\nIn autumn and winter, the yin *qi* is stern and congealed—\nthis is Heaven’s expanded killing mechanism,\nso dragons and serpents fear it and hide in hibernation.\nWhen winter yields to spring, yin recedes and yang grows—\nthis is Heaven’s relaxed killing mechanism,\nso dragons and serpents rejoice and awaken.\n\nHeaven has cold and warmth,\nvirtue/power likewise has cold and warmth.\nWhen virtue/power and punishment are strict and orderly,\nthis is the ruler’s expanded killing mechanism,\nso the lowly fear it and submit.\nWhen virtue/power falters and punishment becomes partial,\nthis is the ruler’s relaxed killing mechanism,\nso the wicked rejoice and run wild.\n\nRank has its high and low,\nmirroring Heaven and Earth,\nthus it is said:\n*'When Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism,\ndragons and serpents rise from the land,\nand banditry and chaos take root;\nwhen humanity unleashes the killing mechanism,\nHeaven and Earth invert,\nand high and low are thus overturned.'*\n\nThe Duke of Zhou, Zhuge Liang, and others\ntake the slaughter of ten thousand men,\ngreat winds and storms,\nand the sun obscured at midday,\nas signs of Heaven and Earth inverting—\nhow mistaken they are!\n\n---\n**Heaven and humanity unite in virtue/power (*德*), ten thousand transformations rest upon their foundation.**\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Heaven moves the mechanism of calamity and blessing above,\nthe ruler shifts the mechanism of benefit and harm below—\nthus, those with virtue/power flourish through ten thousand transformations,\nreaching the heights of kingship;\nthose without virtue/power decline through ten thousand transformations,\nfalling to ruin.\n\nHence, it is said:\n*'Heaven and humanity unite in virtue/power,\nten thousand transformations rest upon their foundation.'*\nThis is the natural order.\n\n---\n**Nature has skill and clumsiness, which can be concealed.**\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The Sage’s nature\nis skilled in applying wisdom,\nclumsy in applying force.\nWhen in poverty or peril,\nthey plot the Dao to deliver it;\nwhen confronting the strong or the clever,\nthey conceal righteousness to retreat.\nThis is the way to govern a state,\nand likewise the way to employ troops.\"*\n\nThe nine orifices’ malice\nlies in the three essentials—\nthey govern motion and stillness.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The nine orifices’ functions\nrest upon the three essentials as their mechanism.\nThe three essentials are: **mechanism (機)**, **emotion (情)**, and **nature (性)**.\nTo **mechanize (機之)** is to ensure nothing remains unsettled;\nto **emotionally sway (情之)** is to ensure nothing remains uncorrupted;\nto **align with nature (性之)** is to ensure nothing remains unrectified.\nThus, the Sage moves to suppress their emotions,\nremains still to preserve their nature,\nand finds joy to steady their mechanism.\nThe petty man does the opposite—\nhence the later passage:\n*‘Duke Zhou established the three essentials as ear, eye, and mouth;\nLi Qin took them as heart, spirit, and will—all forgetting the mechanism.’\nBoth lost the true intent of the *Yin Symbol*.\n\nFire arises from wood—\nwhen calamity strikes, it must conquer;\ntreachery arises in the state—\nwhen stirred, it must collapse.\nTo know and refine this is called the Sage.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘Wood’s nature is stillness;\nwhen moved, it generates fire.\nUnaware, the fire grows fierce,\nand consumes its own substance.\nSo too, humanity’s nature is stillness;\nwhen moved, it generates treachery.\nUnaware, treachery takes root,\nand disrupts the state.’\n\nThe enlightened perceive others’ vulnerabilities to set their mechanisms;\nthe wise discern others’ flaws to exploit their advantages—\nthus, while the world calls them foolish,\nthey attain the Dao’s principle.\n\nHence, the living believe they’ve secured their lives,\nthe dead believe they’ve secured their deaths—\nnon-action yet nothing remains undone:\nthis is the Dao’s logic.\n\nHeaven’s birth and death are the Dao’s logic.\nHeaven and Earth are thieves of the ten thousand things;\nthe ten thousand things are thieves of humanity;\nhumanity is thief of the ten thousand things.\nWhen the three thefts are just,\nthe Three Powers rest in harmony.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘Heaven and Earth transform through yin-yang qi into the ten thousand things,\nyet the things remain unaware of their theft.\nThe ten thousand things nourish humanity with flavors of good and evil,\nyet humanity remains unaware of their theft.\nHumanity governs the ten thousand things through schemes of benefit and harm,\nyet the things remain unaware of their theft.\nThe three thefts harmonize mysteriously within the human heart,\nthe Three Powers align in stillness with Heaven’s principle.\n\nTo eat when the time is right—\na lifetime of unending benefit;\nto act when the mechanism is ripe—\nall creatures rest in ease.\nTo eat out of season, to act without mechanism—\nnearly invites annihilation.\nThus it is said:\n*‘To eat in season, the hundred limbs flourish;\nto act in mechanism, the ten thousand transformations are at ease.’\n\nHumanity knows its spirit as spirit,\nyet does not know why the spirit is spirit.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘Common folk do not recognize theft as theft,\nonly attributing it to the spirit’s power.\nThe *Ghost Valley Classic* says:\n*‘When neither party is aware, it is called spirit.’\nThis is the function of subtle action realized.\n\nLi Qin did not grasp this passage’s unity with the three thefts,\ninstead contrasting the Sage and the foolish—\nhow greatly he erred!\n\nThe sun and moon follow their numbers,\ngreat and small have their fixed roles—\nthus the Sage’s deeds manifest,\nand divine clarity emerges.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘The sun and moon follow their measures—\nthis is their appointed motion;\ngreat and small have their fixed roles—\nthis is the hierarchy of ruler and subject.\nTo observe Heaven’s timing,\nto scrutinize human affairs,\nto seize humanity’s mechanisms—\nthus the Sage attains deeds,\nand divine clarity is revealed.\nWhen the heart aligns with principle,\nthis is the ultimate good.\n\nLi Qin took celestial cycles as the sun and moon,\nand residual fractions as great and small,\nclaiming spirit-qi could generate the Sage’s deeds and divine clarity—\nhis errors are extreme.\n\nTheir theft of mechanisms\nno one in the world can see or know.\nThe noble who attains it safeguards their life;\nthe petty who attain it risk their fate.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘Their theft is subtle in motion,\nyet its application is vast and clear,\nits execution profound and mysterious.\nThe noble uses it—\nin prosperity, they benefit all under Heaven—\nDuke Zhou is such a one.\nIn adversity, they perfect themselves—\nConfucius is such a one.\nIs this not discernment in choosing advantage?\n\nThe petty use it—\nconfused by reputation, they lose themselves—\nis this not the case of Lord Zhen?\nTo gain advantage while losing virtue—\nis this not the case of Li Si?\nIs this not failing to uphold the Dao with sincerity?\n\nThe blind excel in hearing,\nthe deaf excel in sight.\nTo sever the single source of advantage,\nto employ troops tenfold.\nTo repeat day and night threefold,\nto employ troops ten thousandfold.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘The blind excel in hearing,\nforgetting color to discern sound—\nthus their acuity is sharpened.\nThe deaf excel in sight,\nabandoning hearing to focus on vision—\nthus their clarity is heightened.\nHence they achieve the work of ten men.\nTo act three times in a single day—\nthis is how they reach their goal.\nTo reflect three times in a single night—\nthis is how they refine their precision.\nThus they can command ten thousand men.\n\nLi Qin did not know *troops* refers to the multitude,\nmistaking it for *military strategy*—\na grave error.\n\nThe heart is born from things,\ndies from things,\nand its mechanism lies in the eyes.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘The heart harbors emotions of love and hatred;\nthings possess utility or ruin.\nThe eyes observe them externally,\nthe heart responds and judges internally.\nIf good, they act in accordance;\nif not, they refrain—\nthus encouraging virtue and punishing vice.\n\nLi Qin took Item羽’s failure to perceive the mechanism as the heart born from things,\nand Shí Huán’s perception as the heart dying from things—\nyet he failed to recognize utility and ruin.\n\nHeaven’s ultimate selfishness\ngenerates its ultimate public benefit.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘Natural principle is subtle and unknowable—\nthis is the height of selfishness.’*\n\nThe **Dao/Way**’s natural function is manifest yet unassailable—\nthe height of public benefit.\n\nThe sage embodies it thusly.\n\nLi Qin cites *The Art of War* (《孙子》):\n*\"Love your soldiers as you love your own children,\nand they will follow you to death.\"*\n\nWhy so? The **mechanism** of capture lies in **qi** (氣).\n*The Classic* (《传》) says:\n*\"Capture things with **qi** (氣),\ncontrol them with **mechanism** (機)—\nwhat need of brute force?\"*\n\nThe **Great Marshal** (太公) asks:\n*\"Would one use brute force to dominate?\"*\n\nLi Qin fails to grasp the **mechanism** of capture,\nmistaking it for the **Dao/Way** of beasts.\nHis annotations cite such as:\nturtles devouring serpents,\nyellow-bellied beasts consuming tigers—\nhow tragic!\n\nThe living are the root of death,\nthe dead are the root of life.\n\n**Virtue/power** (恩) arises from harm,\nharm arises from **virtue/power**.\n\nThe living are what people love,\nfor they are thick upon the body.\nExcess leads to the loss of the **Dao/Way**,\nand death comes naturally.\n\nThe dead are what people hate,\nfor they harm one’s affairs.\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is most clear,\nlife is naturally preserved.\n\nWhere **virtue/power** (福) reaches,\nthat is called **virtue/power** (恩);\nwhere calamity strikes,\nthat is called harm.\n\nIf one is harmed,\nit benefits others—\nthus harm generates **virtue/power**.\n\nLi Qin cites *The Art of War*’s use of arms as life and death,\nand **Great Marshal** (丁公) and **Master Guan** (管仲) as examples of **virtue/power** and harm—\nhow strange!\n\nFools call Heaven and Earth’s patterns **virtue/power** (恩),\nI call the **Dao/Way** of time and things profound.\n\nOthers see folly in my **Dao/Way**,\nI see wisdom in not foreseeing.\n\nOthers await its coming,\nI await its coming with wisdom—\n*The Classic* (《传》) says:\n*\"Observe Heaven’s movement through the four seasons,\nperceive Earth’s transformation in all things—\nknowing all yet veiling it with ignorance,\na small **virtue/power** toward others,\nto nurture oneself in deception.\"*\n\nTo know the seasons’ progression,\nto know all things’ birth—\nthese are natural.\n\nThus the sage abides in the **Dao/Way**’s balance,\n*The Classic* (《传》) says:\n*\"Therefore, it is said: ‘Life and death lie within me alone.’*\n\nA person’s death and life\nare like drowning in water or burning in fire—\nself-destruction.\n\nTo govern a state with the **Dao/Way**,\nlies in diminishing its affairs alone.\n\nTo command an army with **authority** (權),\nlies in annihilating its soldiers alone.\n\nThus, without the **mechanism** of death,\none does not die—\nwhat concern are ghosts and spirits to me?\n\nThe sage cultivates the self to secure one’s family,\ngoverns the state to pacify the world—\nin establishing the **mechanism** of life.\n\nTo remove one’s own **mechanism** of death,\nthat is the **mechanism** of life.\n\nTo eliminate the **mechanism** of death\nand take its **virtue/power** (情) of life—\nthat is the **mechanism** of death.\n\nLi Qin fails to comprehend Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,\nand verifies it through fools, sages, and those who embody it yet remain ignorant—\nhis error is grave.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Drowning in water, burning in fire—\nself-destruction,\"*\nas noted above.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of ultimate stillness is natural,\nthus Heaven and Earth, all things, are born.\n\n*The Classic* (《传》) says:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** of nature—\neffortless yet nothing is left undone.\nMotion and stillness both attain their essence,\nthe height of stillness.\"*\n\nStillness thus establishes Heaven and Earth,\ngenerates all things—\nnaturally so.\n\n**Master Yi** (伊尹) says:\n*\"In ultimate stillness,\none does not know how life arises.\"*\n\nHeaven and Earth’s **Dao/Way** is subtle,\nthus **yin** and **yang** prevail.\n\n*The Classic* (《传》) says:\n*\"Subtle, like a gradual permeation.\nHeaven and Earth’s **Dao/Way**,\nembodied yet applied subtly—\nall transformations return to the proper order,\nthe gradual essence of subtlety.\"*\n\nThus subtlety permeates,\ndividing **yin** and **yang**,\ncompleting the four seasons—\nthe ultimate of firmness and compliance.\n\n**Yin** and **yang** interact,\nand their transformations proceed in compliance.\n\n*The Classic* (《传》) says:\n*\"The sage follows **yin** and **yang**’s **mechanism** (機).\nHeaven and Earth’s positions are natural,\nthus one follows them in mystery,\nuses them in accordance—\nall attain the **Dao/Way** of nature.\"*\n\nTherefore, the sage knows\nthe **Dao/Way** of nature cannot be defied,\nand follows it accordingly—\nas noted above.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of ultimate stillness,\neven **laws** (律) and **calendars** (历) cannot fully grasp—\n*The Classic* (《传》) says:\n*\"In the **Dao/Way**’s ultimate stillness,\n**laws** and **calendars** are applied yet cannot conform—\nthis is like beasts and birds.\"*\n\nHence there are wondrous tools,\ngenerating all phenomena.\n\nThe **Eight Trigrams** (八卦) and **Celestial Stems** (甲子) hold\ndivine **mechanism** (機) and hidden **Dao/Way** (藏).\n\n*The Classic* (《传》) says:\n*\"The **Eight Trigrams**’s shifting arts,\nfrom this arise.\nAbove, all phenomena;\nbelow, all **mechanisms** (機).\n\nUsing the **Eight Trigrams** to embody Heaven,\nusing the **Nine Categories** (九畴) to model Earth.\nCombining with **climate** (氣候),\nthreading with **Celestial Stems** (甲子),\nreaching through **divine mechanism** (神機),\nconcealing with **deceptive storage** (诡藏),\nthe wondrous and cunning surging naturally.\"*\n\nThe **mechanism** of **yin** and **yang**’s mutual conquest\nis clearly manifest in the **phenomena** (象).\n\n*The Classic* (《传》) says:\n*\"The **mechanism** of **yin** and **yang**’s mutual conquest—\nconstantly subtle yet never defying its root,\nits clarity is trustworthy and clear,\nthus it can penetrate the **precise** (精) and **illuminating** (曜) **phenomena**.\"*\n\n**Annotations on the *Heavenly Mechanism Classic* (《阴符》):**\nThe preface says:\n*\"If there is **mechanism** yet no sage to wield it, it fails;\nif there is a sage yet no **Dao/Way** to guide him, it fails.\nThus *The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:\n‘Spotting the stag, without alarm—\nonly entering the forest.\nThe noble one almost does not hunt it,\nfor he regrets the effort.’\nThus the sage observes the times and uses their **Dao/Way** (符),\nresponds to **mechanism** and controls the matter—\nthus he can wield life and death in his grasp,\nachieve success across the world.\"*\n\n*The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:\n*\"The noble one stores wondrous tools within himself,\nwaiting for the time to act.\"*\n\nTherefore, the sage preserves them in the **spiritual platform** (灵台),\nto observe **mechanism** and change.\n\nWhen coiled, they conquer themselves;\nwhen unfurled, they conquer others.\nWhen examined, they are formless;\nwhen applied, they reach their limits.\n\n*The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:\n*\"**Yin** and **yang**’s unfathomable essence—\nthis is called **divine** (神).\"*\nAnd the *Heavenly Mechanism Classic* (《阴符》) embodies it.\n\nThus the sage’s unfathomable **Dao/Way** (符),\nmolds the world without blame.\n\nHeaven is Earth’s sovereign,\nthe **Dao/Way** is the **virtue/power** (德) of the ruler—\nthus the sage honors Earth and models Heaven,\nestablishes **virtue/power** and practices the **Dao/Way**.\n\nHe raises Heaven’s **Dao/Way** as the first principle,\nand clarifies Earth to honor it.\n\n*The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:\n*\"Thus one complies with Heaven,\nwaiting for the time to act.\"*\n\nTherefore, when the sage would act,\nhe must first observe Heaven’s **Dao/Way**’s fullness and emptiness,\nthen execute accordingly.\n\n「When undertaking actions in accordance with circumstances,\nthere will be no wasted strategies.\n*The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:\n*\"Follow Earth’s **Dao/Way** while honoring Heaven’s **virtue/power** (時).\"*\n\n△昌知\nThe sage models Earth and honors Heaven,\nestablishes **virtue/power** and practices the **Dao/Way**.\nHe who dwells between Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and Earth’s **virtue/power**,\nand constructs the most magnificent achievements,\nhas never failed to succeed through the **Five Bandits** (五賊).\nThe **Five Bandits** (五賊) are:\nthe first bandit steals life,\nthe second bandit plunders wealth,\nthe third bandit seizes opportunity,\nthe fourth bandit undermines merit,\nthe fifth bandit assaults **divine** (神) authority—\nthe **Dao/Way** of the **August Emperor** (皇), **Sage-King** (王), **Conqueror** (霸), and **Opportunist** (權變).\nThus the sage observes circumstances and responds to them,\nmeasures time and acts accordingly.\nHence, **Duke Zhou** (太公) established the **Conqueror’s Code** (霸典) and extinguished the **Xia Dynasty** (殷朝),\nenacted the **King’s Wind** (王風) and restored order to the **Zhou Dynasty** (周室).\nWas this not following the times and circumstances,\nand wielding the **Five Bandits**?\n\nTherefore, the sage establishes his foundation among the **August Emperor** (皇) and **Sage-King** (王),\nand adapts to circumstances within the **Conqueror’s Code** (權霸).\nIn governing a state and cultivating oneself,\nif the **Five Bandits** are fully deployed,\nthen the world will follow in awe,\nexhausting their lives without blame or resentment.\nHence it is said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** of bandits,\nthe **virtue/power** of invisible armies.\"*\nAh! No greater thieves exist.\nWith the **Five Bandits** in mind,\nand their control in hand,\nthere is no finer art in cultivating oneself and assisting the world.\nAs the text says:\n*\"Those who perceive it prosper,\"*\nis this not fitting?\n\n△身知\nThe **Art of the Body** (術) states:\n*\"In man, the heart is the sovereign,\nthe palace of the **spirit** (魂),\nand the repository of the **vital essence** (魄).\"*\nWhen one would execute the **Five Bandits**,\nthe heart is the most crucial.\nIf one plots with intent,\nit must align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**.\nThen, though the universe be vast,\none surveys it all within the palm of one’s hand;\nthough myriad things exist,\nlife and death never stray from the **Art’s** grasp.\nThus, Heaven and Earth are not too distant or too grand\nto behold—how much less so\nthe sights and sounds before one’s eyes?\n\n△機知\nThe **Dao/Way** of killing is the seed of two dynasties’ rise and fall,\nand the portent of ten thousand lives’ fate.\nIn the days when clouds and thunder have not yet settled,\nwhen the **play of yin-yang** (玄黃) flows like blood,\nHeaven’s transformations unfold—\nthe **Dragon** (龍) emerges from the fields,\nthe **Serpent** (蛇) slithers upon the paths.\nThis is the **Dao/Way** of war,\nhence it is called **\"Dragon and Serpent Stirring the Earth\"** (龍蛇起陸).\nWhen man’s **Dao/Way** shifts,\nspring commands autumn’s orders,\nrewards are given to the disloyal,\npunishments to the faithful—\nthis is the **Dao/Way** of chaos,\nhence it is called **\"Heaven and Earth in Reverse\"** (天地反覆).\nWhen Heaven’s and man’s **Dao/Way** of change arise simultaneously,\nthough myriad transformations occur,\nthe **Dao/Way** of success and failure is already determined.\n\n△藏古\nThe benevolent must have courage,\nyet the courageous are not necessarily benevolent;\nthe wise can feign foolishness,\nyet the foolish are not necessarily wise.\nThus the sage, when his timing is right,\nsees cleverness and accomplishes great deeds;\nwhen his timing is wrong,\nsees clumsiness and obscures his traces.\nHence **Zhuge Liang** (孔明) in his *Preface* (《序》) says:\n*\"Duke Zhou was eighty years old,\nnot because he did not encounter the right moment,\nbut because he discerned his master’s **virtue/power**.\"*\nAh! At the moment when life and death hinge upon cleverness or clumsiness,\nand one recognizes the **Dao/Way** of retreat and concealment,\none can observe changes, perceive circumstances,\nand wield the **Five Bandits**.\n\nThis is how it is:\nThe sage’s **Dao/Way** is to penetrate deeply and gaze far,\nto act without missing a moment,\nobserving Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and measuring man’s fate,\nresponding to the times.\nThus *The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:\n*\"Who knows advancement and retreat,\nsurvival and extinction,\nyet never strays from the **Dao/Way**?\nOnly the sage!\"*\n\n△靜主\nThe **Nine Orifices** (九竅) are in Heaven the **Nine Stars** (九星),\non Earth the **Nine Regions** (九州),\nand in man the **Nine Orifices**.\nWhen the **Nine Orifices**’ **qi** is unbalanced,\nit is called **\"receiving evil\"** (受邪).\nTo receive evil is to have one’s discernment and actions skewed;\nwhen discernment and actions are skewed,\none cannot perceive circumstances or observe changes.\nThus the urgency of the **Nine Orifices**\nlies in the **Three Essentials** (三要).\n**Duke Zhou** (太公) said:\n*\"Ears, eyes, and mouth.\"*\nEars, eyes, and mouth are the heart’s assistants;\nthey are the **spirit**’s (神) gateways;\nthey are the pivot of wisdom;\nthey are the source of fortune and calamity.\nThus, ears without acuity cannot distinguish sounds,\neyes without clarity cannot perceive circumstances,\nand a mouth without restraint cannot issue commands.\nIf the **Three Essentials** are not refined,\none cannot govern a state above,\nnor manage a household below—\nhow much less can one command armies?\nTo suspend the lives of men,\nto determine the fate of nations,\nbetween stillness and motion,\none cannot act without purpose—\nhow can one treat them lightly and employ them?\"*\n\n△人齋\nFire is born from wood,\nyet fire erupts and wood is consumed.\nA nation is born from deceit,\nyet deceit deepens and the nation falls into disorder.\nIt is like the silkworm that spins a cocoon,\nyet the cocoon completes and it perishes;\nor man who creates matters,\nyet his schemes multiply and they harm his life.\nOnly the most enlightened sage can refine his conduct and cultivate his actions,\npreventing evil before it sprouts,\nand correcting disorder before it arises.\nA tree encircled ten times by a man’s arms begins as a sapling;\na hundred-foot-high terrace starts with a single shovelful.\nIf small evils are not addressed with fear,\nthey will grow into great calamities.\nAh! If wood does not rub against wood,\nfire has no means to ignite;\nif a nation lacks corrupt governance,\ndeceit has no means to arise.\nWith beginning and end,\nright and wrong remain undisturbed.\nWho can know this?\nOnly the sage!\n\n△安知\n\nAll things steal the vital essence of Heaven and Earth to take form and grow,\nwhile man steals the shapes of all things to wield and employ them,\nand all things steal the strength of man to cultivate and propagate.\nEach steals from the other in turn, yet all fulfill their proper roles,\nunaware that they are part of the great transformation of all things.\n\nThus, those who master the art of *qi* (機) follow these three principles,\nusing the Way to take what is needed while harming nothing.\nThings, too, recognize the art of taking.\nFor this reason, it is essential to act at the right time,\nand to act at the right moment.\nThus it is said: To eat in harmony with the seasons brings order to the body,\nto act in accord with the *qi* brings peace to all transformations.\nTo act against the seasons and miss the *qi* is to invite calamity and disorder.\n\n△Divine and Ancient—\nThe Old Master says:\n*\"When the work is done, do not claim it as your own;\nact without clinging to the deed.*\nThis is the foundation of preserving life and establishing virtue.\"\n\nThe petty man, greedy for wealth, sacrifices his body for profit,\nand, loving fame, struggles with force to gain renown.\nHe boasts of his marvels and seeks divine reputation,\nyet all things resent him, and he will surely lose his life.\nTo seek gain is to invite loss—this is not divine.\n\nThe noble man accomplishes great deeds without claiming them,\nprevents small misfortunes before they arise,\nretreats from self to advance others,\nand yields his abilities to benefit all things.\nAll things then honor him, and he does not seize their benefits.\nHis wisdom arises naturally, and he does not contend with things—\nthus all things yield to him.\nHe does not linger behind, turning loss into gain—\nthis is the ultimate divine.\n\nThus the Old Master says:\n*\"To act is to court failure;\nto cling is to lose.*\nTruly, these words are profound!\"\n\n△The Sage-Sovereign\n\nThe **Sage-Sovereign** continues:\n\nIf a sage appears once every thousand years and a worthy once every five hundred, then the great and small among men are determined by the celestial cycles of sun and moon. When a great man emerges in the world, he fulfills his **virtue/power** and establishes sage-like achievements; when a petty man rises, he abandons the proper principles and brings forth calamity and chaos. Thus, **Taigong** spoke to **Xībó** of **Zhīrén Wàng** and yet he returned to **Zhōu**; **Liú Kūn** expressed himself in **Lángyá**, recognizing the **Heavenly Time** yet never left **Jìn Líng**; the **Mother** died knowing that the **Bright Sovereign** would surely arise and the **Brackets** would be restored, yet she did not punish him, for she saw that **Zhào’s army** would surely be defeated. Thus, the **Dao/Way of Heaven** and human affairs are such that the worthy can foresee them.\n\nAssist the unworthy, and he will perish with his nine clans. Therefore, the *Yìjing* says:\n*\"The eldest son leads the army,\nand founds the state, completing the lineage.\nDo not employ the petty man—\nhe will surely disrupt the land.\"*\n\n△**Mìnggǔ**\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of success and failure has not yet manifested, nor have the mechanisms of life and death been revealed—yet the petty man can perceive them, while the noble man can truly know them. Perception is easy, yet knowledge is difficult; what is seen is near, yet what is known is far.\n\nThe man who perceives the **mechanism** merely follows the times and seizes advantage, yet he cannot preserve his natural lifespan. The man who truly knows the **mechanism** traces beginnings and grasps endings, thereby ensuring the preservation of his life.\n\n△**Bèigǔ**\n\nThe blind excel in hearing—**qi** does not depart from their ears;\nthe deaf excel in sight—**mind** does not depart from their eyes.\nIn their hearing, **qi** is wholly concentrated in the ears;\nin their sight, **mind** is wholly concentrated in the eyes.\nThe ears and eyes are successive **tools/assistants** for each other.\nWhen one is used, the other’s advantage is cut off.\nWhere the **mind** directs, there is no matter it does not master—\nalready possessing tenfold advantage, how much more so when it repeatedly applies this **tool/assistant**?\nWith threefold reflection and sincere calculation,\nto follow the times while concealing or revealing,\nto respond to the **mechanism** in action or retreat—\nusing this **tool/assistant** thus,\none attains a ten-thousandfold victory.\n\n△**Wùzhāi**\n\nThe human **mind** moves without cause.\nLife and death arise from external things.\nThings move, and the **mind** is born;\nthings are still, and the **mind** dies.\nThe states of life and death—\ndo they not depend entirely on things?\n\n△**Mùgǔ**\n\nThe eyes are the **gate** of **qi**,\nand **qi** is the **master** of the **mind**.\nThe **qi**’s ebb and flow know no other path than the eyes.\nThus, those who perceive the **mechanism** all esteem the eyes,\nwhile those who truly know the **mechanism** all esteem the **mind**.\n\n△**Chǔnrán Zhī**\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **Ultimate Sage** is profound and without action.\nWithout action, there is no **mechanism**;\nwithout **mechanism**, there is **ultimate stillness**.\nThe subtleties of **laws and calendars** lie in motion—\nwhen moved, they can be known.\nYet when the **body** is void and empty,\nno **method/technique** can apply its **control/measurement**—\njust as warriors who do not lose their **mechanism**,\nwho do not expose their **signs/portents**,\nthough wise men may follow,\nfrom where shall they be governed?\n\n△**Xiànggǔ**\n\nWondrous instruments are the result of **yin** and **yang**,\ncapable of generating all things—\njust as the human **mind** can create all phenomena.\nAdvancing forward, they manifest their forms.\nThe **Eight Trigrams** and **Six Jia**—\nthese are the secrets of **ghosts and gods**,\nthe arts of **yin-yang** interaction,\nclearly arrayed in their states before us.",

      "translated_text": "The nine orifices’ malice\nlies in the three essentials—\nthey govern motion and stillness.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The nine orifices’ functions\nrest upon the three essentials as their mechanism.\nThe three essentials are: **mechanism (機)**, **emotion (情)**, and **nature (性)**.\nTo **mechanize (機之)** is to ensure nothing remains unsettled;\nto **emotionally sway (情之)** is to ensure nothing remains uncorrupted;\nto **align with nature (性之)** is to ensure nothing remains unrectified.\nThus, the Sage moves to suppress their emotions,\nremains still to preserve their nature,\nand finds joy to steady their mechanism.\nThe petty man does the opposite—\nhence the later passage:\n*‘Duke Zhou established the three essentials as ear, eye, and mouth;\nLi Qin took them as heart, spirit, and will—all forgetting the mechanism.’\nBoth lost the true intent of the *Yin Symbol*.\n\nFire arises from wood—\nwhen calamity strikes, it must conquer;\ntreachery arises in the state—\nwhen stirred, it must collapse.\nTo know and refine this is called the Sage.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘Wood’s nature is stillness;\nwhen moved, it generates fire.\nUnaware, the fire grows fierce,\nand consumes its own substance.\nSo too, humanity’s nature is stillness;\nwhen moved, it generates treachery.\nUnaware, treachery takes root,\nand disrupts the state.’\n\nThe enlightened perceive others’ vulnerabilities to set their mechanisms;\nthe wise discern others’ flaws to exploit their advantages—\nthus, while the world calls them foolish,\nthey attain the Dao’s principle.\n\nHence, the living believe they’ve secured their lives,\nthe dead believe they’ve secured their deaths—\nnon-action yet nothing remains undone:\nthis is the Dao’s logic.\n\nHeaven’s birth and death are the Dao’s logic.\nHeaven and Earth are thieves of the ten thousand things;\nthe ten thousand things are thieves of humanity;\nhumanity is thief of the ten thousand things.\nWhen the three thefts are just,\nthe Three Powers rest in harmony.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘Heaven and Earth transform through yin-yang qi into the ten thousand things,\nyet the things remain unaware of their theft.\nThe ten thousand things nourish humanity with flavors of good and evil,\nyet humanity remains unaware of their theft.\nHumanity governs the ten thousand things through schemes of benefit and harm,\nyet the things remain unaware of their theft.\nThe three thefts harmonize mysteriously within the human heart,\nthe Three Powers align in stillness with Heaven’s principle.\n\nTo eat when the time is right—\na lifetime of unending benefit;\nto act when the mechanism is ripe—\nall creatures rest in ease.\nTo eat out of season, to act without mechanism—\nnearly invites annihilation.\nThus it is said:\n*‘To eat in season, the hundred limbs flourish;\nto act in mechanism, the ten thousand transformations are at ease.’\n\nHumanity knows its spirit as spirit,\nyet does not know why the spirit is spirit.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘Common folk do not recognize theft as theft,\nonly attributing it to the spirit’s power.\nThe *Ghost Valley Classic* says:\n*‘When neither party is aware, it is called spirit.’\nThis is the function of subtle action realized.\n\nLi Qin did not grasp this passage’s unity with the three thefts,\ninstead contrasting the Sage and the foolish—\nhow greatly he erred!\n\nThe sun and moon follow their numbers,\ngreat and small have their fixed roles—\nthus the Sage’s deeds manifest,\nand divine clarity emerges.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘The sun and moon follow their measures—\nthis is their appointed motion;\ngreat and small have their fixed roles—\nthis is the hierarchy of ruler and subject.\nTo observe Heaven’s timing,\nto scrutinize human affairs,\nto seize humanity’s mechanisms—\nthus the Sage attains deeds,\nand divine clarity is revealed.\nWhen the heart aligns with principle,\nthis is the ultimate good.\n\nLi Qin took celestial cycles as the sun and moon,\nand residual fractions as great and small,\nclaiming spirit-qi could generate the Sage’s deeds and divine clarity—\nhis errors are extreme.\n\nTheir theft of mechanisms\nno one in the world can see or know.\nThe noble who attains it safeguards their life;\nthe petty who attain it risk their fate.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘Their theft is subtle in motion,\nyet its application is vast and clear,\nits execution profound and mysterious.\nThe noble uses it—\nin prosperity, they benefit all under Heaven—\nDuke Zhou is such a one.\nIn adversity, they perfect themselves—\nConfucius is such a one.\nIs this not discernment in choosing advantage?\n\nThe petty use it—\nconfused by reputation, they lose themselves—\nis this not the case of Lord Zhen?\nTo gain advantage while losing virtue—\nis this not the case of Li Si?\nIs this not failing to uphold the Dao with sincerity?\n\nThe blind excel in hearing,\nthe deaf excel in sight.\nTo sever the single source of advantage,\nto employ troops tenfold.\nTo repeat day and night threefold,\nto employ troops ten thousandfold.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘The blind excel in hearing,\nforgetting color to discern sound—\nthus their acuity is sharpened.\nThe deaf excel in sight,\nabandoning hearing to focus on vision—\nthus their clarity is heightened.\nHence they achieve the work of ten men.\nTo act three times in a single day—\nthis is how they reach their goal.\nTo reflect three times in a single night—\nthis is how they refine their precision.\nThus they can command ten thousand men.\n\nLi Qin did not know *troops* refers to the multitude,\nmistaking it for *military strategy*—\na grave error.\n\nThe heart is born from things,\ndies from things,\nand its mechanism lies in the eyes.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘The heart harbors emotions of love and hatred;\nthings possess utility or ruin.\nThe eyes observe them externally,\nthe heart responds and judges internally.\nIf good, they act in accordance;\nif not, they refrain—\nthus encouraging virtue and punishing vice.\n\nLi Qin took Item羽’s failure to perceive the mechanism as the heart born from things,\nand Shí Huán’s perception as the heart dying from things—\nyet he failed to recognize utility and ruin.\n\nHeaven’s ultimate selfishness\ngenerates its ultimate public benefit.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*‘Natural principle is subtle and unknowable—\nthis is the height of selfishness.’*",
