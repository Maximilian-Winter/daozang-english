  "full_translation": "**The Collected Meanings of the Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**\n\n**Title:** *The Collected Meanings of the Dao/Way and Virtue/Power*\n**Compiled by:** Yuan Dynasty Liu Weiyong\n**Volume:** Seventeen\n**Source of the base text:** *The Zhengheng Daoist Canon* (洞神部), *Jade Precepts Category* (玉诀类)\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: Master Ningyuan’s Dao/Way and Virtue/Power at Xuanmiao Guan on the Changde Path**\n**Compiled by:** Liu Weiyong, with guidance from Master Ningyuan\n**Corrected by:** Former imperial official Ding Yidong, who served as *Taifu Temple Clerk* (太府寺簿) and *Editor at the Secretariat* (枢密院编修)\n\n**The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power (Dao De Jing) – Critical Examination of Variations**\n**Note on textual differences:** *He Shang Gong’s* edition divides *The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* into two sections; this follows *Wang Fushi’s* edition instead.\n\n**The Sage of the Dao/Way says:**\nThe Dao/Way is the path all share in common;\nVirtue/Power is what the heart universally attains.\nThe Dao/Way endures through all ages without decay,\nVirtue/Power fills the nature and remains forever.\n\nAt the close of the Zhou Dynasty,\nthe Dao/Way descended while Virtue/Power waned,\nthus the sage composed ninety-nine chapters to elucidate the eternal principles of Dao/Way and Virtue/Power,\nand called it *The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Scripture*.\nIts words are concise, its meaning profound—\nscholars must discern and delve deeply into it.\n\n**Huang Maocai said:**\nThe Dao/Way is what all must pass through to be born;\nVirtue/Power is what all must attain to be nourished.\nThe heavens and earth use this to give birth and sustain all things,\nthus they are inexhaustible;\nThe perfected sage uses this to give birth and sustain the self,\nthus they do not die.\n\nThough the Dao/Way and Virtue/Power have two names,\nin truth they serve as one—\nthey cannot be separated.\nIn the present age, scholars divide the upper chapters as *The Dao/Way*\nand the lower chapters as *Virtue/Power*,\nwhich is far from the original intent of the work.\nIt would be better to call it *The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Scripture* in its entirety.\n\n**Shi Tan said:**\nThere are many interpretations of *The Laozi*,\nbut those by Confucian scholars—\nsuch as Cheng Tai’s and Lin Zhuhan’s—\noften explain the Dao/Way in terms of Confucian *dao*,\nas if it were the principle guiding daily conduct.\nThose by Buddhist scholars—\nsuch as Su Yingbin’s and Benlai Zi’s—\noften explain it in terms of Buddhist *xing* (性),\nas if it were the bare, naked nature of beings.\nNeither approach captures the original meaning,\nfor Confucian *dao* refers to the principle within ordinary affairs,\nwhile Laozi’s *dao* is the voidless, natural Way.\nHow can one forcefully align Laozi’s *dao* with Confucianism?\nBuddhist *xing* (性) refers to the pure emptiness untainted by form or *qi*,\nwhile Laozi’s *dao* encompasses the harmonious interplay of form and spirit.\nHow can one forcefully align Laozi’s *dao* with Buddhism?\n\nThough it is said that \"under heaven there is no second Dao/Way\"\nand \"the sage has no dual heart,\"\nyet the benevolent see it as benevolence,\nand the wise see it as wisdom—\ntheir distinctions must be clearly understood.\n\nConfucian scholars explain *dao* as the principle beyond form,\nyet they hold that it does not depart from the instruments of the lower realm.\nBuddhist scholars explain *xing* (性) as pure emptiness,\nyet they exclude form and *qi*.\nLaozi, however, seeks the marvelous unity of form and spirit,\nso that they may align with the true Dao/Way.\nThis is why their interpretations differ.\n\nIf each adheres strictly to their own teaching,\nnot only will they fail to grasp Laozi’s core intent,\nbut they will also lose sight of their own true teachings.\n\nAs for Daoist interpretations—\nsuch as those by Bai Yuxian—\nthey are indeed faithful to the original,\nbut they tend to favor lofty abstractions and oversimplification,\nmaking the text obscure and rendering it akin to Guo Xiang’s commentary on *The Zhuangzi*.\nThus, this present commentary\nadheres strictly to Laozi’s original teaching,\nso as not to stray from his true intent,\nyet it avoids the lofty obscurity of Bai Yuxian’s style.\n\nScholars should examine this carefully.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter: \"The Dao/Way That Can Be Spoken Of\"**\n**Note on textual differences:** *He Shang Gong* titled this chapter *\"The Chapter of Embodiment\"* (体道章),\nand Zhao Shixian titled it *\"The Chapter of Illuminating Principles and True Meanings\"* (显理会真义章).\nThis follows the *Ming Huang* (Tang Emperor) edition.\n\n**Tang Emperor’s commentary on this chapter:**\nAt the origin of all marvelous transformations and the source of ten thousand changes,\nthe chapter first marks the Dao/Way as *the void’s utmost* (虚极),\nto reveal where all marvels converge.\nThus, \"the Dao/Way that can be spoken of\" and \"the name that can be given\"\nclarify the substance and function of the Dao/Way;\n\"without name, yet with name\" reveals the essence and its traces;\n\"without desire, yet with desire\" distinguishes two perspectives;\n\"the same origin, yet different names\" shows how the undifferentiated gives rise to all things;\n\"the same name, yet called the mysterious\" shows how all things return to the undifferentiated.\n\"Mysterious again, mysterious again\" elucidates the interplay of unity and forgetfulness.\n\"The gateway of all marvels\" indicates the path by which one attains enlightenment and exits.\n\nThese are the stages of progress and refinement,\nthe gradual path to enlightenment and true understanding.\n\n**Du Guangting’s *Broad Commentary on the Daoist Canon* (广圣义) explaining the Emperor’s commentary:**\n*\"Ming\"* (明) means luminous and pure—\nto reveal openly.\n*\"Miao ben\"* (妙本) refers to the Dao/Way.\nAt the beginning of the Scripture,\nit clarifies the Dao/Way’s origin.\n*\"You\"* (由) means to follow;\n*\"Qi\"* (起) means to arise.\n*\"Wan\"* (万) signifies the vastness of numbers.\n*\"Hua\"* (化) means transformation and adaptation—\nit speaks of all things arising from the Dao/Way through transformation.\n*\"Zong\"* (宗) means master;\n*\"yuan\"* (源) means origin.\nSince all transformations arise from the Dao/Way,\nthen knowing the Dao/Way is the master and origin of all transformations.\n\nFrom this chapter, all principles emerge,\nlike the ceaseless flow of water from its source.\n*\"Xu ji\"* (虚极) is the Dao/Way’s marvelous origin,\nthe Dao/Way being its ultimate designation.\n\nThis chapter first marks the Dao/Way that can be spoken of as its substance,\nand the name that can be given as its function.\nThe final chapter returns to the gateway of all marvels,\nwhere all traces converge toward the Dao/Way’s origin,\nand once again directs us toward the Dao/Way’s true essence.\n\nWithin this gateway, seven distinctions are made:\n1. *\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of\"* and *\"the name that can be given\"* clarify its substance and function.\n2. *\"Substance and function\"* (体用) means mutual reliance.\n   Substance has no fixed form, function has no fixed application—\n   without function, substance cannot be displayed;\n   without substance, function cannot be established.\n   Sometimes there is substance, sometimes function;\n   sometimes both are real, sometimes provisional;\n   sometimes manifest, sometimes symbolic;\n   sometimes named, sometimes represented—\n   they mutually define each other,\n   alternating to reveal their nature.\n   Thus, substance and function are understood as interdependent clarifications.\n\n3. *\"Without name, yet with name\"* reveals the Dao/Way’s essence and its traces.\n   Essence and traces are mutually generative.\n   There is essence, then traces arise;\n   traces lead us to the essence.\n   Without essence, traces cannot appear;\n   without traces, essence cannot be sought—\n   traces emerge with each event,\n   serving as the essence’s manifestation.\n\nThe root is the **origin**—\nthe traces, the **manifestation**.\nTraces are the footprints left behind,\nyet are they truly the foot?\nTraces arise from the foot,\nbut to take traces as the foot\nand then command others to walk upon them—\nthis only further distances one from the Dao.\n\nThus, traces are the **end**.\n\n3. *\"With desire and without desire\"*—\nthe two perspectives differ.\n**Observation** is the **practice** itself.\nOne observes with the **self’s perception**,\nanother with the **spirit’s discernment**.\nTo still the sight externally,\nto concentrate the spirit internally,\nto illuminate the single mind within,\nto forget the myriad forms without—\nthis is called **observation**.\n\nIt serves as the **stage for Daoist practice**,\nthe **gradual path to veracity**,\nfirst relying on observation and practice,\nentering the **Gate of the Mysterious**.\n\nThe Dao cannot be attained by name,\nnor sought through form—\nthus, observation and practice become the **path of cultivation**.\nFor those with desire, it leads to **death**;\nfor those without desire, it aligns with **life**.\nThus, one observes **life and death**,\ntheir paths diverging.\n\n4. *\"Same origin, different names\"*—\nthe **Uncarved Block** disperses into **vessels**.\nThe **Great Uncarved Block** is the **Dao**.\nThe Dao disperses as **spiritual luminosity**,\nflows as **sun and moon**,\ndivides into **the Five Phases**,\ngives birth to **all things**.\n**Vessels** are **formed with function**.\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"What is above form is called the Dao;\nwhat is below form is called vessels.\"*\n\n5. *\"Called the Mysterious\"*—\nthe **return to the Uncarved Block after formation**.\nSpiritual luminosity, sun and moon,\nthe Five Phases, all things—\nthough formed and vessel-like,\nthey all conform to the Dao,\nhence, **\"return to the Uncarved Block.\"**\n\n6. *\"The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious\"*—\ndiscerning **dual forgetting**.\nWhen forming vessels,\none must remain in the Uncarved Block.\nAfter returning to the Uncarved Block,\nthis Uncarved Block is also forgotten—\nonly then does one **harmonize with the Dao**.\nThus, it is called *\"the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious.\"*\n**Dual forgetting** means\nforgetting both vessel and Uncarved Block.\n\n7. *\"The Gate of All Mysteries\"*—\nshowing the **path of transcendence**.\nWhen vessel and Uncarved Block are both forgotten,\none clearly harmonizes with the Dao,\nreturning to the **beginning of transformation**—\nthe **Gate of All Mysteries**.\nHumans and all things equally receive from the Dao;\nwith **action and desire**, one loses the Dao and harms life.\nBy **abandoning desire and preserving harmony**, one returns to the root—\nthis is called the **essential gateway of the Dao**.\n**Transcendence** is **leaving the world**.\n\nZhang Chong replied:\nThe **Dao** is the **natural Way**—\nheaven, though highest, does not know what it covers;\nthis is the **naturalness of Heaven’s Dao**.\nEarth, though vast, does not know what it bears;\nthis is the **naturalness of Earth’s Dao**.\nHumans, standing between heaven and earth,\nhave eyes to see, like heaven’s sun and moon;\nhave mouths to speak, like heaven’s thunder.\nBreathing brings wind, exhaling brings mist,\nspittle and coughs like rain and dew—\ntheir **hearing and awareness** mirror **spiritual luminosity**,\nall the **naturalness of Heaven’s Dao**, which I possess.\n\nAs for the four limbs complete,\nlike the four **directions** steadfastly grounded,\nthe **sacred bone** at the crown,\nlike **Mount Sumeru** towering—\nblood flowing through the vessels,\nlike rivers encircling—\nthis is the **naturalness of Earth’s Dao**, which I also possess.\n\nIf one truly embodies the **natural Dao of heaven and earth**\nand cultivates it further,\nthe turbid becomes clear,\nthe ordinary attains immortality,\nand the virtuous becomes sage.\nThus, **\"Embodying the Dao\"** is the first chapter of *The Daoist Classic*.\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is **not the eternal Dao**.\nThe name that can be named is **not the eternal name**.\n**Nameless**, it is the **beginning of heaven and earth**.\n**Named**, it is the **mother of all things**.\nThus, one must **constantly observe without desire** to see its **mystery**,\nand **constantly observe with desire** to see its **outcome**.\n\nThese two, though of the same origin, bear different names—\nboth called the **Mysterious**,\nthe **Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**,\nthe **Gate of All Mysteries**.\n\n**Annotations from the Emperor’s Edition** omit the *\"without\"* character;\nhere, following the **River Upper Master’s** version.\n\nThe **River Upper Master** said:\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken\"* refers to **doctrine, governance, and teaching**.\n*\"Not the eternal Dao\"* means it is **not the natural, long-life Dao**.\nThe **eternal Dao** constantly **nurtures the spirit with non-action**,\n**governs without interference**, **conceals light and hides brilliance**,\n**erases traces and obscures origins**—\nit cannot be named as the Dao.\n\n*\"The name that can be named\"* refers to **wealth, nobility, and eternal honor**.\n*\"Not the eternal name\"* means it is **not the natural, enduring name**.\nThe **eternal name** is like an **infant before speech**,\nan **egg before hatching**,\na **pearl within the shell**,\na **jewel in stone**—\nthough internally luminous,\nexternally it appears **foolish and crude**.\n\n**Nameless** is the **beginning of heaven and earth**.\n**Nameless** refers to the **Dao**.\nThe Dao is formless, hence **unnamable**.\n**Beginning** is the **origin of the Dao**.\nIt exhales *qi* and spreads transformation,\nemerging from **emptiness and non-being**,\nas the **origin of heaven and earth**.\n\n**Named** is the **mother of all things**.\n**Named** refers to **heaven and earth**.\nHeaven and earth have **form, position, yin, and yang**,\n**hardness and softness**—this is their **named** quality.\n**Mother of all things**—heaven and earth contain *qi* and give birth to all things,\nnurturing them to maturity, like a mother rearing her child.\n\nThus, one must **constantly observe without desire** to grasp its **essence**.\n**Essence** is the **key**.\nIf one constantly **abandons desire**, they can observe the **core of the Dao**.\n**Core** means **unity**.\nUnity issues forth, spreading **named principles**,\nclarifying **right and wrong**.\n\nOne must **constantly observe with desire** to see its **outcome**.\n**Outcome** means **return**.\nThose who constantly **hold desire** can observe the **trends of the world**.\n\nThese two, though of the same origin, bear different names—\nthe two refer to **with and without desire**,\nsame origin means **both arise from human nature**,\nyet different names refer to their **distinct outcomes**.\nThe name **\"without desire\"** leads to **eternal life**,\nthe name **\"with desire\"** leads to **self-destruction**.\n\nBoth are called the **Mysterious**.\n**Mysterious** means **heaven**.\nIt speaks of those with and without desire **both receiving *qi* from heaven**.\n\n**The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**—\nwithin heaven, there is another heaven.\nThe **thickness of received *qi*** varies—\nthose who obtain **central harmony and nourishment** become **sage and virtuous**,\nthose who receive **disorder and corruption** become **greedy and lustful**.\n\n**The Gate of All Mysteries**—\nto know that within heaven there is another heaven,\nthat received *qi* varies in thickness,\nand to **eliminate emotions, abandon desire**,\n**preserving central harmony**—\nthis is called knowing the **essential gateway of the Dao**.\n\n**Wang Fu-si** said:\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken, until it reaches the eternal name.\"*\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the constant name.\nTo point to things and shape forms is not its eternal essence—\nThus, it cannot be spoken, cannot be named.\n\nThe **Nameless** is the mother of all things.\nAll that exists begins from the **Nameless**—\nThus, before form and name arise,\nIt is the origin of all things.\n\nWhen form and name appear,\nIt nurtures, sustains, and guides them—\nIt is their mother.\n\nIt speaks of the Dao:\nBeginning from formless, nameless,\nIt gives rise to all things,\nYet its origin and completion are unknown—\n**Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**.\n\nThus, one must **constantly be without desire** to perceive its subtlety.\n**Subtlety** is the utmost refinement.\nAll things begin from the subtle and then take form,\nFrom the **Nameless** and then come to life—\nThus, one must **constantly be without desire**,\nEmpty and void within,\nTo perceive the subtlety of their origin.\n\nOne must **constantly have desire** to perceive its **boundaries**.\n**Boundaries** mean **completion**.\nAll that exists, for its utility,\nMust rely on the **Nameless** for its use.\nThe root of desire,\nWhen aligned with the Dao, finds fulfillment.\n\nThus, one must **constantly have desire**,\nTo perceive the completion of all things’ boundaries.\nThese two are the **Gate of All Mysteries**.\n\nBoth originate from the **Mother**,\nEmerging together from the **Mysterious**—\nThough their names differ in application,\nAt the beginning, it is called **Origin**,\nAt the end, it is called **Mother**.\n\nThe **Mysterious** is the **Dark**—\nSilent, without form.\nThe **Origin** and **Mother** arise from it,\nYet cannot be named—\nThus, it cannot be spoken.\nThe same is called **Mysterious**,\nAnd when spoken of, it is called **Mysterious**,\nTaken from what cannot be grasped and thus named so.\n\nTo call it so,\nIs to say it cannot be confined to a single **Mysterious**—\nTo name it thus is to stray far.\n\nThus, it is said: **Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**.\nAll subtleties arise from the same source—\nThus, it is called the **Gate of All Mysteries**.\n\nEmperor Tang Minghuang said:\n*The Dao that can be spoken reaches the point of no name.*\n\nThe **Dao** is the **uttermost subtlety in action**;\nThe **name** is the designation given to things as they receive its use.\nIts use applies to things—\nThus, it is called *speakable Dao*.\nNames arise from use—\nThus, it is called *nameable name*.\n\nIf its application is boundless and without fixed form,\nThen it transcends a single Dao;\nIf things differ and names vary,\nThen it transcends a single name.\n\nThus, it is forcibly named **Dao**,\nYet the Dao is always **Nameless**.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe **Dao** is the **forcible name** for the **uttermost subtlety of origin**.\n*Training* (通训) and *direct instruction* (径首一字) mark the essence.\nThat which can be spoken of is this **subtle origin**,\nThe pathway through which all things arise—\nThus, it is called *speakable Dao*.\nThat which is **not the constant Dao** is the **subtle origin** in transformation,\nIts use without fixed direction—\nForcibly named, yet not confined to one Dao—\nThus, it is called *not the constant Dao*.\n\nThe **name** is the designation given to things as they receive the Dao’s use.\nThe first character marks the essence.\nThat which can be named is because names arise from use—\nThus, it is called *nameable name*.\nThat which is **not the constant name**—\nIn Heaven, it is called *Clear*,\nOn Earth, it is called *Tranquil*,\nIn the Spirit, it is called *Numinous*,\nIn the Valley, it is called *Full*—\nThough one, their applications differ—\nThus, it is called *not the constant name*.\n\nThe **Nameless** is the mother of all things.\nThe **Nameless** is the **subtle origin**.\nThe **subtle origin**, manifesting as *qi*,\nSupports Heaven and Earth—\nHeaven and Earth rely on it for their beginning—\nThus, it is called the **Nameless**.\n\nThe **Named** is its application.\nIts application, skillfully applied,\nNurtures all things—\nThings receive their nourishment,\nThus, they have names.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe **Nameless** is before transformations arise,\nWithout forcible naming.\nThe **subtle origin** at its beginning,\nBefore the **Nameless** descends as *qi*,\nOpens and establishes Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth mutually support each other as their origin—\nThus, it is called the **Nameless**, the origin of Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the *Taiji* generating the *Two Principles* in the *Yijing*.\n\n*Powering and supporting* (权舆) means *beginning* (as in the *Er Ya*).\nThe **Named** is its skillful application,\nWith forcible naming.\nWhen transformations arise and all things are formed,\nThe **subtle origin** branches outward,\nProviding for human use—\nThrough its abundant nourishment,\nIt is called the **Mother**.\n\nThe **Mother** is defined by its abundant nourishment—\nYet the **Nameless** and **Named** are distinctions made by the Sage\nTo clarify the unity and difference of origin and trace,\nWhile the Dao does not depend on having or lacking names.\n\n**Constantly without desire** to perceive its subtlety,\n**Constantly with desire** to perceive its boundaries.\n\nHumans are born in stillness—\nThis is Heaven’s nature;\nWhen moved by things, they act—\nThis is the nature of desire.\nIf one constantly guards purity and clarity,\nReleases the mind and frees the spirit,\nReturns to reflect the true nature,\nThen one perceives the **subtle origin**.\n\nIf one does not govern one’s emotions,\nChases desires and moves,\nThe nature is lost to desire,\nLost to the Dao’s source—\nTo perceive the **subtle origin**,\nOne only sees its **boundaries**.\n\n**Desire** is the movement of nature—\nTo say it is to establish teaching through thought.\n**Constantly without desire** means\nThe nature is pure and clear,\nWithout attachment to speech or thought,\nThen one sees the Dao’s utmost subtlety.\n\n**Constantly with desire** means\nFrom the origin, action arises,\nTeaching follows speech,\nResponding to things and communicating effortlessly,\nTransforming the world—\nThen one sees where all people converge.\n\n**Boundaries** mean **convergence**.\nThese two arise together yet differ in name—\nAs above, both originate from the Dao—\nThus, they are the same.\nAction emerges from application,\nNames are established by use—\nThus, their names differ.\n\nThis refers to the matters above:\nThe two—**speakable/unspeakable Dao**, **named/nameless**, **with/without desire**—\nEach has its pair—\nThus, they are called the two.\n\n「Both share the wondrous origin,\nThus, they are called the same.\n\nFrom the origin descending,\nNames are established by application—\nThus, their names differ.\n\nThe same is called **Dao/Way**,\nWhen it manifests, names differ—\nThe same is called **Dao/Way**.\n\n**Dao/Way** is profound and wondrous.\nWhen it is spoken of as manifest,\nNames differ—\nThis is descending from the origin to describe its traces.\n\nWhen it is spoken of as the same,\nIt is profound and wondrous—\nThis is gathering traces to return to the origin.\n\nReturning to the origin is profound and wondrous,\nThus, it is called **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** again profound,\nIs the gateway to all wondrous things.\nWhen the **intention-root** does not arise,\nIt aligns with the profound and wondrous—\nYet still, one may cling to **Dao/Way** as stagnation,\nFailing to achieve dual forgetfulness—\nThus, it is entrusted with **Dao/Way** again profound,\nTo dispel **Dao/Way** itself.\n\nTo **illuminate the Dao/Way of non-desire in non-desire**—\nIf one can do this,\nAll dharmas emerge through it—\nThus, it is called the gateway to all wondrous things.\n\nGathering traces and returning to the origin is called profound and wondrous.\nIf one dwells in this wondrous state,\nFurther progress remains—\nThough differing in name,\nIt is equal without distinction—\nThus, it is entrusted with **Dao/Way** again profound,\nTo dispel **Dao/Way**,\nLest one become stagnant in **Dao/Way**,\nAnd achieve dual forgetfulness—\nThis is called **non-abiding**.\n\n**Non-abiding** then reveals all.\n\nThe **intention-root** is annotated in the *Sutra of the Western Ascension* as:\n*\"Same origin, differing names—\nEach thing generates its own intention-root.\"*\n\nNow, when the **intention-root** does not arise,\nIt aligns with the profound and wondrous.\n\nTo **illuminate the Dao/Way of non-desire in non-desire**—\nThis is the desire to eliminate desire,\nThus, seeking non-desire;\nDesire to seek non-desire,\nIts origin is already detached from desire.\n\nWhen desire is truly absent,\nNon-desire is also absent—\nDispelling again and again,\nThis is called **total forgetfulness**.\n\nObserving thus directly,\nThis is called all wondrous things.\n\nThough their wondrousness is manifold,\nAll emerge from this gateway—\nThus, it is called the gateway to all wondrous things.\n\nDu Guangting’s *Expanded Explanation of the Sacred Meaning* states:\n**\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao/Way.\"**\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the utmost emptiness and extremity,\nNeither form nor sound,\nEnduring through later kalpas yet not ceasing,\nPreceding heaven and earth yet not beginning.\nRoundly permeating, serene and tranquil,\nNeither beginning nor ceasing—\nSages, through the **virtue/power** of **permeating transformation**,\nCan trace its manifestations,\nYet its origin can be **awakened**—\nThus, they name the **virtue/power** of **permeating transformation** as **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **principle** is marked by the single character,\nWhich is **non-action and formless**—\nThe **substance** of **Dao/Way**.\nThe two characters **\"can be spoken of\"**—\nAre **manifestation and transformation**—\nThe **functions** of **Dao/Way**.\n\nWithin these three characters,\nThe **substance** and **functions** are established.\nThe **substance** is wondrous beyond measure,\nThe **functions** are vast beyond reckoning—\nThus, it is the wondrous origin of **emptiness to the extreme**.\n\nDispersed, it becomes all things,\nUnconstrained by a single direction—\nThus, it is called **without fixed direction**.\n\nBut adhering to the single **Dao/Way**,\nIt clarifies that all things rely on **Dao/Way** for transformation—\nThus, it does not favor partiality.\n\nLofty yet without limit,\nIt contains all without exclusion—\nThis is **greatness**.\n\nLofty yet without limit,\nIt does not cling to the lofty—\nGreat yet without bounds,\nIt does not cling to the outer—\nThis is **transience**.\n\n**Transience**, meaning to go forth,\nPenetrates the boundless,\nReaching all without obstruction—\nThis is **distant**.\n\nEmpty-hearted, abiding in the single **Dao/Way**,\nThis is the **return and restoration**.\n**Return**, meaning to revert—\nThus, it is called the **return and restoration**.\n\nThis draws from Chapter Twenty-Five of the *Dao De Jing*:\n*\"From the origin, all things arise—\nThus, it is called the constant Dao/Way.\"*\n\nFrom this, one may infer:\nThat which does not constantly abide in its place\nIs called the **non-constant Dao/Way**.\n\nNames that can be named are **non-constant names**.\nNames are true speech.\nThe single character **\"principle\"** is the origin of names,\nThe two characters **\"can be named\"** are its traces.\n\nTraces disperse in things,\nCalled the **ten thousand particulars**—\nFrom traces to the origin,\nThey merge with **Dao/Way**—\nThus, **Dao/Way** is the origin of names,\nNames are the end of **Dao/Way**.\n\nOrigin and end mutually generate,\nTo complete transformation.\nWithout function, **Dao/Way** congeals;\nWith function, names are established.\n\nHeaven, obtaining **Dao/Way**, manifests the clear and bright forms,\nEarth, obtaining **Dao/Way**, is solid and tranquil,\nThe **spiritual** obtains **Dao/Way**, transformation ceaselessly,\nThe **valleys** obtain **Dao/Way**, fullness without deficiency.\n\nThis draws from Chapter Two of the *Dao De Jing* to clarify its meaning.\n\nNames dispersed without limit,\nThis is called the **non-constant Dao/Way of Luo**.\n\nThe **nameless** is the beginning of heaven and earth.\nThe **nameless** is the **emptiness to the extreme**, the wondrous origin,\nBefore the **virtue/power** of **Dao/Way** is established.\nThe beginning of the wondrous origin,\nThere is no **nameless**—\nFrom origin descending to traces,\nGenerating heaven and generating earth—\nHeaven and earth rely on the beginning,\nThus, it is said: the **nameless** is the beginning of heaven and earth.\n\nThe **great Dao/Way** exhales **qi** and spreads it across the void,\nBecoming the origin of heaven and earth.\n\nFrom the beginning, there is no **nameless**—\nAs the *Zhuangzi*’s **\"Heaven and Earth\"** chapter says:\n*\"At the dawn of creation, there was the **non-being**,\nAnd the **non-being** had no name.\"*\n\nThe **non-being** already without name,\nCannot be questioned with **Dao/Way**,\nCannot be elucidated with names—\nMingled and indistinct, tranquil and vast,\nEnduring as the **master of transformation**—\nThe **original qi** relies on it to begin.\n\nThe **profound transformation** receives it and attains life—\nThus, it is said: the **nameless** is the beginning of heaven and earth.\n\nThe **nameless** has no lineage,\nThen descending and advancing,\nGradually forming signs and shapes—\nThus, heaven and earth are born,\nAnd the **forms of qi** are established.\n\nThe **Great Ultimate** is when form and substance are complete.\nForm and substance complete,\nThen the **two principles** are divided—\nHumans are born within them,\nThus forming the **three talents**.\n\nThe **named** is the mother of all things.\n**All transformations** refer to their multiplicity.\n**All things**—\nWithin all things, **Dao/Way** is nowhere absent.\nEven the finest hair of autumn,\n**Dao/Way** dwells within it—\nThus, it can generate the **three talents**,\nAnd be the mother of all things.\n\nAll things—\n**Dao/Way** exists, they are born;\n**Dao/Way** departs, they perish.\nThe utmost **nourishment and containment**,\nIs it not called the mother?\n\nThe **great Dao/Way** is without difference or sameness,\nWithout origin or traces—\nYet through the **virtue/power** of **Dao/Way** and teaching,\nIts origin and traces are revealed.\n\n**Constantly without desire** reaches its limit,\nTo observe its **convergence**.\n\nThe **mechanical mind** lodged in the chest,\nIs pure white yet not perfected in **spiritual virtue**—\nOne who **abides in the body** is not harmonious,\nThis is **desire**.\nIf the **mind of harming** is forgotten within,\nEven a tiger’s tail can be trodden—\nWhat more of humans?\n\nThis is **non-desire**.\nThe **desiring** cling to ears and eyes for seeing and hearing,\nExhaust the mind and thoughts for reasoning—\nSeeing and hearing grow more confused,\nReasoning grows more disordered—\nThis can be called observing the **boundaries of convergence**.\n\nThe **non-desiring** merge their **spirit** with the void,\nTheir **qi** with the **non-being**—\nReaching all without obstruction,\nPenetrating all without hindrance—\nAligning with the function of heaven and earth,\nThey merge with the **great Dao/Way**,\nThis can be called observing its **wondrousness**.\n\nThe observer, externally surveys with the eyes,\nInternally illuminates with the spirit—\nThe eyes discern the presence and absence,\nThe spirit resonates with the silent void.\n\nHumans are born in stillness—\nThis is the nature of Heaven, as spoken in *The Record of Music*.\nIt speaks of nature being inherently pure and tranquil,\nWithout desire or striving.\nWhen moved by things, stirred by circumstances,\nSensations arise from without and stir within—\nHow can one be cautious of what one is moved by?\n\nThus, the Sage establishes laws to curb their wickedness,\nInstitutes rites to curb their chaos,\nEnacts punishments to curb their excesses,\nCreates music to curb their licentiousness.\nBy the Dao restraining desire,\nThis is how the people are taught to revere virtue and pursue goodness.\n\nThese two [paths] arise from the same source but differ in name.\n\nFrom the One Qi, myriad transformations arise;\nFrom the emergence of forms, myriad things manifest.\nThe three transformations vary, yet twofold—\nFrom non-being, being emerges—\nThis is what is meant.\n\nWhen the Dao is manifest, names are established;\nWhen names are established, desire arises—\nThis is where the Dao can be spoken of,\nWhere names can be named,\nWhere the mechanism of desire is ignited.\nThis is how traces arise from their roots.\n\nTo **shelter the traces** is to abandon desire, forget names,\nAnd return to the wondrous root of the Dao—\nTo forget the Dao in names,\nTo forget names is to return to the root.\n\nThose who follow their emotions chase desire and forget the root,\nDescending into slipperiness—\nOnly those who return to the origin of things\nCan speak of the utmost Dao.\n\nBoth are called **mysterious**.\n\nThose with desire and those without desire\nReceive qi from Heaven and Earth.\nIf they receive the balanced, harmonious essence,\nThey become virtuous and sage, acting without doing.\nIf they receive turbid, chaotic qi,\nThey become dull and foolish, with many desires.\n\nIf one can purify the heart, transform thoughts,\nClarify desire and contain emptiness,\nThen they are those who shelter the traces and return to the root.\n\nWhen all cultivate and refine themselves,\nAnd customs return to simplicity and harmony,\nThe wind of returning to simplicity\nCan reach the ancient past.\n\nMysterious beyond mysterious—\nThe gateway to all wonders.\n\nTo shelter the traces and forget names\nAlready grasps its wonder—\nYet fearing stagnation in wonder,\nOne forgets it again—\nThus, both root and trace are forgotten.\nAgain forgetting this intention,\nThe spirit merges with the Dao.\n\nHaving dispelled desire,\nEven non-desire is forgotten—\nNot clinging to being or non-being,\nNot fixating on the middle path—\nThis is the complete forgetting.\n\nThe gateway to all wonders is the Heavenly Gate.\nThe Heavenly Gate is the total name for the origin of all dharma.\nWithout being—\nIt speaks of all things emerging from non-being,\nReturning to non-being—\nGathering and dispersing, concealing and revealing—\nThus, they are transient guests of coming and going.\n\nEmpty in name, yet no true gate exists—\nThus, it is called the gate of non-doing.\n\nThen, there is no gate—\nNo gate means no sides—\nFour-way openness, vast and boundless—\nThis is returning to the wondrous Dao.\n\n**True observation** is the gradual path of cultivation,\nThe stages of verifying the Dao.\n\nThe earlier \"seen with the eyes\" is the observation of surveying.\nThe \"illuminated by the spirit\" is the observation of practice.\n\nThe Dao also employs the Three Vehicles’ methods to transform people,\nFrom initial awakening to ultimate attainment—\nAbandoning the mundane to realize the sacred—\nThus, there are fourteen stages of observation and practice.\n\nThe Small Vehicle’s initial gate has three observations:\nFirst, the **observation of provisional dharma**—oppositional discernment.\nSecond, the **observation of true dharma**—illumination of the mind.\nThird, the **observation of pervasive emptiness**—entering non-doing.\n\nThe Middle Vehicle’s gate of observation and practice has four:\nFirst, the observation of **impermanence**,\nSecond, the observation of **eternity**,\nThird, the observation of **non-impermanence**,\nFourth, the observation of **non-eternity**.\n\nThe Great Vehicle’s gate of observation and practice also has four:\nFirst, the **observation of wondrous being**,\nSecond, the **observation of wondrous non-being**,\nThird, the **observation of profound mystery**,\nFourth, the **observation of non-profound mystery**.\n\nThe Sacred Practice gate further has three observations:\nFirst, the **observation of true emptiness**,\nSecond, the **observation of true penetration**,\nThird, the **observation of true non-being**.\n\nThrough these observations and practices,\nOne refines the mind—\nFrom being to non-being,\nFrom coarse to wondrous—\nAttaining wonder and forgetting it,\nThus resonating with the gate of non-doing.\n\nNon-doing and doing—\nThe Dao can be spoken of as constant Dao,\nBody and function held together—\nIts principle is clear.\n\nNow, within the gate of body and function,\nIt is divided into five distinctions:\nFirst, **non-doing as body, doing as function**—\nThe Dao as body is without,\nNames as function are with.\nSecond, **doing as body, non-doing as function**—\nHouses, carriages, tools—\nTheir doing is body,\nTheir non-doing is function—\nUtilizing their non-being.\nThird, **non-doing as body, non-doing as function**—\nNaturalness as body,\nConditional relations as function—\nAll are non-being.\nFourth, **doing as body, doing as function**—\nHeaven and Earth as body,\nAll things as function—\nAll are being.\nFifth, **neither being nor non-being as body,\nNeither being nor non-being as function**—\nThe Dao as body,\nVirtue/power as function.\n\nAgain, within the gate of root and trace,\nIt is divided into two distinctions:\n**Non-being as root, being as trace**—\nNon-naming and naming.\n**Being as root, non-being as trace**—\nMutual illumination.\n\nAll things originate from being yet ultimately return to non-being.\n\nFrom the mysterious source, pure and silent,\nThe wondrous root, distant and obscure—\nNot sought through words or symbols,\nNot verified through being or non-being—\nIndeed, debate on principles is exhausted,\nSpeculation on the Dao is at its end—\nYet teachings are set forth to guide the mundane,\nDemonstrating these stages.\nYet it lies in the silent heart’s resonance,\nGradual or sudden, adapting to each case—\nDo not cling to teachings or fixate on words,\nBe not bound by scholarly conventions.\nThose who bathe their hearts in virtue and power,\nStrive diligently.\n\nThe Lord of the Dao says:\n*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao.*\n\nWithout beginning, it is called the Dao—\nUnspeakable, yet to speak of it is false.\nAgain it says:\n*The Dao should not be named,*\n*Yet the speakable and nameable Dao*\n*Is like things, like the four seasons—*\n*Appropriate when it should be.*\n\nRising and declining in succession,\nThis is not true constancy.\nConstant Dao, constant name—\nFrom its own root, its own foundation—\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed,\nIt has eternally endured.\n\nFu Xi obtained it to inherit the **Qi of the Mother**,\nThe Western Queen Mother attained it and sat in **Minor Broadness**—\nNo one knows its beginning,\nNo one knows its end.\n\nThe Nameless is the Mother of ten thousand things.\nThe Dao is ever nameless—\nHeaven and Earth await it to give birth,\nAs Zhuangzi says: *\"It gives birth to Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed,\nWho could name it?\nThus, it is nameless—\nThe beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n\nOnly after Heaven and Earth came into being\nDid ten thousand things arise,\nThus it is named—\nThe Mother of ten thousand things.\n\nConstantly without desire,\nOne observes its limits.\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"Establish it with constant non-being.*\n*Not establishing any thing—*\nThis is called constant non-being;\n*Not abandoning any thing—*\nThis is called constant being.\n\nConstant non-being is in principle—\nIts upper reaches are unfathomable,\nThe utmost subtlety under Heaven,\nThus one observes its marvel.\n\nConstant being in the world—\nIts lower reaches are not obscured,\nThe utmost transformation under Heaven,\nThus one observes its limits.\n\nThe two realms of being and non-being,\nWithin them lies subtle mystery.\nGreat wisdom observes both together,\nAnd thus nothing is unattainable.\n\nWithin vague and indistinct,\nThere are forms and things.\nSmall wisdom is self-serving,\nObscured by one-sidedness,\nClinging to being while rejecting emptiness,\nPursuing the superficial while forgetting the root—\nThus Dao/Way and its arts are shattered for all under Heaven.\n\nThese two—when most alike—are called *Xuan* (the Mysterious).\nThe Dao originally has no form—\nWho would speak of its marvels?\nThings and I share the same root—\nThis is called *one qi*,\nThus it is called *Xuan*.\n\nThe confused of the world\nAbandon illusion to seek truth,\nYet the farther they stray from truth,\nNot knowing that what is called \"thing\"\nIs merely a difference in names.\n\n*Xuan* again *Xuan*—\nThe gate of all marvels.\n\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* says:\n*\"Xuan gives birth to spirit.\"*\n*The I Ching* says:\n*\"Spirit—*\n*This is the subtle speech of all things.\"*\n\nSmall yet marvelous—this is *Xuan*.\n*Xuan*—the color of Heaven.\nThough the colored is manifest,\nThe coloring itself never reaches completion.\n\n*Xuan* again *Xuan*—\nThis is called \"coloring.\"\n\nThe subtle principle of *Xuan*\nIs possessed by all things.\nHeaven’s movement,\nEarth’s resting,\nHuman aliveness,\nThe flourishing of ages—\nAll are marvels,\nYet all emerge from *Xuan*,\nThus it is called the gate of all marvels.\n\nConfucius composed the *I Ching* down to *The Sayings on the Trigrams*\nBefore speaking of marvels.\nWhile Laozi begins with this in his first chapter.\nThe words of the sages complement each other’s end and beginning.\n\nWang Anshi said:\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao.\"*\nConstant—Zhuangzi says—\nIs without past or future,\nWithout end or beginning.\nThe Dao originally cannot be spoken of,\nYet if it can be spoken of,\nThen it is its progression.\nIf it has boundaries,\nThen it is not my eternal Dao.\n\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nThe Dao originally has no name,\nYet if it has a name,\nThen it is not my eternal name.\nNames arise from meaning,\nThus there are names.\n\nThe Nameless is the Mother of ten thousand things.\nNon-being names the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nBeing names its end.\nThus it is called the Mother of ten thousand things.\n\n*The Complete Meaning* says:\nNon-being is above form.\nFrom the Great Beginning to the Great Initiation,\nFrom the Great Initiation to the Great Polarity,\nThe Great Initiation gives birth to Heaven and Earth—\nThis is named the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n\nBeing is below form.\nOnly after Heaven and Earth did ten thousand things arise—\nThis is named the Mother of ten thousand things,\nFor *mother* means *to give birth*.\n\n*The Main Explanation* says:\nThe Nameless is the Great Initiation,\nThus it is the Father of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Named is the Great Polarity,\nThus it is the Mother of ten thousand things.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the union of ten thousand things;\nTen thousand things are the separation of Heaven and Earth.\nSpeaking of the Father as Heaven and Earth,\nThen ten thousand things become known.\nSpeaking of the Mother as ten thousand things,\nThen Heaven and Earth also become known.\n\nConstantly without desire,\nOne observes its limits.\n\nThe origin of the Dao lies in non-being,\nThus constant non-being observes its marvel.\nThe function of the Dao returns to being,\nThus constant being observes its limits.\n\nThese two are called *Xuan*.\n*Xuan* again *Xuan*—\nThe gate of all marvels.\n\nFor one cannot constantly remain in non-being,\nWithout which one cannot observe its marvel.\nOne cannot constantly remain in being,\nWithout which one cannot observe its limits.\nTo observe its marvel and its limits,\nOne knows that being and non-being\nEmerge from the same *Xuan*.\n\n*The Complete Meaning* says:\nThe Dao is one,\nYet its explanations are two.\nWhat are these two?\nBeing and non-being.\nNon-being is the origin of the Dao,\nAnd what is called *marvel*.\nBeing is the end of the Dao,\nAnd what is called *limits*.\n\nThus the origin of the Dao lies in the boundless and obscure,\nWhile its end disperses into forms, names, and measurements.\nThese two—though one Dao—\nThe confused of the world often regard as separate.\nWhy?\nBoundless and obscure constantly abide in non-being,\nWhile forms, names, and measurements constantly abide in being.\nBeing and non-being cannot coexist.\nThis is why they are obscured and cannot preserve themselves.\n\nNon-being names the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nWhile being names the Mother of ten thousand things—\nThough their names differ,\nThey never fail to serve each other.\nBeing and non-being,\nLike east and west in opposition,\nYet cannot negate each other.\nWithout being, there is no way to perceive non-being,\nAnd without non-being, there is no way to produce being.\nThe transformations of being and non-being\nAlternate and interweave,\nYet never depart from the Dao.\nThis is what the sages call *spirit*.\n\n*The I Ching* says:\n*\"Without thought,\nWithout action,\nSilent and unmoving,\nYet responding and thus communicating*\n*the principles of all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThis is what is spoken of.\n\nTruly, the sages of old would always observe its subtlety through their *wu si wu wei* [non-thinking, non-action],\nand always perceive its manifestations through *gan er sui tong tianxia zhi gu* [responding and thus communicating the principles of all under Heaven].\nWhen both subtlety and manifestations are attained without partiality,\nwho but the most divine could partake in this?\n\nThus, the Dao of the sages is now evident.\nTo observe its subtlety is to exhaust the divine;\nto observe its manifestations is to know transformation.\nWhen the divine is exhausted and transformation is known,\nwhat more can be added to the Dao of Heaven and Earth?\nThese two are called *xuan* [profound] when brought to their utmost.\n\nThese two—\nthe Dao of being and non-being—\nboth originate from the Dao.\nIt speaks of how the essence and function of being and non-being\nall emerge from the Dao.\nScholars of the world often regard non-being as refined and being as coarse,\nyet they do not know that both arise from the Dao,\nhence they are called *xuan* when spoken of together.\n\nThese two, though differing in name,\noriginate from the same source—*shen* [divine]—\nyet differ in their names: being and non-being.\nThe sage embodies this,\nthus manifesting divine virtue.\nHence, abiding in non-being suffices to perceive its subtlety;\nabiding in being suffices to know its manifestations.\nYet ultimately, it transcends the names of being and non-being.\n\nThe highest insight knows the origin of Heaven and Earth,\nwhile the lowest suffices to govern the order of all things—\nall through this.\n\n*The Zishuo* [Explanation of Characters] says:\n*\"Covered and entering—this is *xuan* [profound].*\nThus, *xuan* is composed of *xu* [cover] and *ru* [enter].\nThese two are called *xuan* together.\nThese two refer to being and non-being.\n\n*Xuan* is also black, yet bears a red hue.\nThe north is black as yin, yet *xuan* is yang.\nThus, the *I Ching* says:\n*'Kun on Earth is black.'*\nAnd again:\n*'Heaven is *xuan*, Earth is yellow.'*\nShun spoke of *xuan de* [profound virtue],\nreferring to its depth in the sage below.\n\nSu Yingbin said:\n*'The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\nYet all that can be spoken of is not the Dao—\nonly what cannot be spoken of can be constant.*\nNow, *ren* [benevolence], *yi* [righteousness], *li* [rites], and *zhi* [wisdom]\nare the Dao that can be spoken of.\nYet benevolence cannot be made righteousness,\nnor rites made wisdom.\nWhat can be spoken of cannot be constant in this way.\nOnly what cannot be spoken of\nallows *ren* to remain *ren*,\n*yi* to remain *yi*,\n*li* to remain *li*,\nand *zhi* to remain *zhi*—\nthough all these are not constant,\nthe Dao remains unchanging and unalterable.\nWhat cannot be spoken of alone can be constant in this way.\n\nWhat can be named is not the constant name.\nThe Dao cannot be spoken of—\nhow much less can it be named?\nAll names are of what can be spoken of.\nOnce names are established,\nthe distinctions of round and square, curved and straight\ncannot remain constant.\n\nNon-being names the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nuntil one observes its *jiao* [manifestations].\nFrom its nameless form, Heaven and Earth arise,\nand once positioned, names begin to establish themselves.\nFrom its named propagation, ten thousand things emerge,\nand as they flourish, names become innumerable.\nThus, the nameless is the essence of the Dao,\nwhile the named is its function.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao for the world’s use,\nentering all things while remaining constantly non-being,\nto observe its subtlety;\nembodying the utmost non-being while remaining constantly being,\nto observe its manifestations.\nIf one acts only in its manifestations without knowing its subtlety,\nit is coarse and not divine.\nIf one lingers only in its subtlety without knowing its manifestations,\nit is refined yet not comprehensive.\n\nThese two, when brought to their utmost, are called *xuan*.\nSpeaking in terms of form,\nbeing and non-being are indeed two—\nhow can one know that non-being transforms into being,\nand being returns to non-being,\nyet they are never separate?\nThough their names differ,\ntheir origin is one.\nKnowing their origin as one,\nthis is *xuan*.\n\nAll that is distant without limit\nmust be of a *xuan* hue,\nthus Laozi often used *xuan* to convey the extreme.\n*Xuan* beyond *xuan*—\nthe gateway to all subtleties.\nSpeaking of *xuan* is to reach it,\nyet still the mind of *xuan* remains.\n*Xuan* beyond *xuan* is exhausted—\nnothing more can be added—\nthe source from which all subtleties emerge.\n\nLü Jifu said:\n*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.*\nAll the Dao under Heaven that can be spoken of\nis not the Dao—\nyet at times it is perilous, hence not the constant Dao.\nAll names under Heaven that can be named\nare not the constant name—\nten thousand things, each returning to their root,\nreturning to the root is called *jing* [stillness],\nstillness is called *fu ming* [restoring life],\nrestoring life is called *chang* [constant].\nWhen the Dao reaches constancy,\nthe mind solidifies, the form relaxes,\nand self and objects are forgotten.\nWho can know the Dao that can be spoken of,\nor the names that can be named?\n\nThus, the constant Dao is indeed unspeakable.\nHence it is said: *The Dao endures long, yet does not perish with life.*\nThe constant name is indeed unnameable.\nHence it is said: *From ancient times to today, its name does not fade.*\n\nNot perishing, not fading—\nthis is called the constant Dao.\nNon-being is the Mother of ten thousand things.\nConstant non-being is the Dao itself,\nand the origin from which Heaven and Earth begin,\nhence it is said: *Non-being names the beginning of Heaven and Earth.*\n\nAt the *Tai Chu* [Great Origin], there was being and non-being,\nyet non-being had no name.\nBeing and non-being—\neven one cannot be named with being and non-being,\nfor the origin of one, though not yet formed, already exists.\nOnce called *one*,\nthough not yet formed, it already has a name.\nThe name *one* is one,\nyet the one who names is two—\ntwo and one make three,\nand from here ten thousand things arise in confusion.\nThus it is said: *The named is the Mother of ten thousand things.*\n\nConstant non-being reaches the observation of its manifestations.\nKnowing constancy is called *ming* [clarity],\nand clarity sees all things.\nThus, only constancy can be observed—\nwhen desireless, it purifies and gazes profoundly,\nwith no flaw in observing its subtlety,\nhence it is said: *Constant non-desire can be named as small.*\nWhen desire arises,\nten thousand things act together,\nand all things return to it,\nyet the master remains unknown—\nthis can be named as great.\n\nThe two, when most harmonized, are called *Xuan* [Mysterious].\nOnly the small reveals its subtlety (*miao*), only the great reveals its manifestations (*jiao*).\nThough their origins are the same, their names differ—\nand though their names differ, their essence never truly does.\nFor whether with desire or without, seeking their origin,\none finds nothing—\nnothing to find means their origin is the same,\nthus they are called *Xuan*.\n\nAs to *Xuan*’s hue,\nblack and red are one in unity.\nThe sky’s hue is *Xuan*—\nyin and yang are one in unity.\nUnity in oneness is indeed subtle.\nYet subtle in oneness is not yet subtle in multiplicity;\nsubtle in self is not yet subtle in things.\nThe gate to *Xuan*’s utmost.\n\n*Xuan* again *Xuan*—\nthen even the same is unattainable.\nIf the same is unattainable,\nthen oneness and multiplicity, self and things—\nall are without fail subtle.\nThe subtlety of ten thousand things arises from this alone.\n\nMaster Lu said:\n*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.*\nThe constant name has *wu-fang* [boundlessness] as its essence,\nthe constant Dao has *wu-ti* [formlessness] as its function.\nBoundlessness is nowhere absent,\nformlessness does nothing it omits—\nif there is anything that can be spoken of, it is not boundlessness;\nif there is anything that can be named, it is not formlessness.\nThe unnamed is the Mother of ten thousand things.\nAt the *Tai-ch’i* [Supreme Polarity], there is *wu* [non-being],\nand *wu* has no name.\nThe unnamed is *Tai-shih* [Great Beginning],\nthe Great Beginning is the parent of heaven and earth.\nThus it is said: *The unnamed is the beginning of heaven and earth.*\nHeaven and earth are the Mother of ten thousand things.\nThus it is said: *The named is the Mother of ten thousand things.*\nSpeak of Mother and you know the Beginning as Father;\nspeak of Beginning and you know the Mother as Sovereign.\nThus above it speaks of the beginning of heaven and earth,\nbelow it speaks of the Mother of ten thousand things.\nConstant non-desire reaches the observation of its manifestations.\n*Miao* is the origin of the Dao,\n*Jiao* is the end of the Dao.\nThe Sage, regarding *miao*, observes with constant non-desire;\nthe Sage, regarding *jiao*, observes with constant having.\n*Miao* lies within, *su* [coarse] lies at the end—\nspeak of *miao* and you know *jiao* as coarse,\nspeak of *jiao* and you know *miao* as central.\nThus above it speaks of desire to observe *miao*,\nbelow it speaks of desire to observe *jiao*.\nThe two, when most harmonized, are *Xuan*.\n\nThe *wu* [non-being] that opposes *you* [being] is not the *wu* of constant non-being,\nand constant non-being is not the *wu* that opposes *you*.\nThe *you* that opposes *wu* is not the *you* of constant having,\nand constant having is not the *you* that opposes *wu*.\nThat which does not oppose *wu* is not *you*,\nthat which does not oppose *you* is not *wu*.\nThus constant non-being is true non-being, yet not *wu*;\nconstant having is subtle being, yet not *you*.\nHence the two arise from the same source,\nand thus they are called *Xuan*.\nThe gate to *Xuan*’s utmost.\n\n*Xuan* is the essence of subtlety,\nsubtlety is the function of *Xuan*.\nWhen the Dao reaches *Xuan*’s utmost,\nhumans become the gate to all subtleties,\nentering and exiting between them.\nZhuangzi said:\n*The sky’s opening is not the opening of human sky.*\nThe sky’s opening is natural;\nthe human sky is contrived.\n*Xuan* again *Xuan*—\nthis is Zhuangzi’s *precise of the precise*.\nThe gate to all subtleties—\nthis is Zhuangzi’s *divine of the divine*.\n\nMaster Wang Yuanze said:\n*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.*\nThe Dao is the path of ten thousand things—\nin essence, it is essence;\nin function, it is function.\nWithout name, without progression,\nit is nowhere absent.\nThus the Sage’s words always dwell in one aspect,\nthough dwelling in one aspect,\nthey differ from the myriad schools of thought,\nyet do not lose principle or conform to the times.\nThe Dao that can be spoken of adapts to the times and acts accordingly;\ntimes shift without pause,\nand the Dao responds to change.\nFor creation subtly moves,\nnever ceasing for an instant—\nthus today is not yesterday.\nYet petty scholars grasp brilliance as the Dao’s root,\npointing to the *Zhun Lu* [a legendary dwelling] as the Sage’s abode.\nLaozi was about to loosen their obstructions,\nand questioned them with ultimate truth.\nThus this opening chapter clarifies this,\nso that even today’s words are not constant.\n\nThe name that can be named is not the constant name.\nNames arise from reality,\nand reality has form and number—\nonce form and number are complete,\ndecay follows inevitably.\nHow can it be constant?\nOnly by embodying the unconstant is true constancy attained.\nThe unnamed is the Mother of the utmost.\n\nReceiving command from non-being,\nit takes form in being—\nthus it is said: *the beginning of heaven and earth, the Mother of ten thousand things.*\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*Only after heaven and earth did ten thousand things arise.*\nThis aligns with the *Yijing*’s sequence.\nBetween the covering and the loading,\nlife emerges—\nthus heaven and earth are spoken of first.\nThings and heaven and earth originally have no precedence,\npushed to their extreme, being and non-being are one essence—\nthe speech of Beginning and Mother is also a metaphor.\n\nThough heaven and earth are vast,\nthey receive command and take form,\nnever truly separate from being and non-being.\nYet it speaks solely of the Mother of ten thousand things—\nthus Laozi’s words merely exhaust nature’s essence.\n\nConstant non-desire reaches the observation of its manifestations.\nThe *Yijing*’s yin and yang,\nLaozi’s being and non-being,\neven to the Buddha’s *color and emptiness*—\ntheir essence is one, differing only in exposition.\nThose who speak of non-being,\nabandoning being to seek non-being,\nare but adding another being beyond being—\nhow can this be non-being?\nThus when there is a time of reality,\nit is not truly non-being—\nthis is true non-being.\nThe essence of being and non-being is always one,\nbut when observing with being,\none only sees its surface—\nto observe its subtlety,\none must know its original non-being,\nyet the non-being of non-being never truly departs from being.\nSpeaking of constant non-being and constant having,\nit is because the names of being and non-being do not succeed one another—\nnon-being is true being,\nbeing is true non-being.\nSpeak of *jiao* and you know *miao* as profound,\nspeak of *miao* and you know *jiao* as coarse.\nThis is the essence of the law’s speech.\nCalled *Xuan* because they are one.\nBeing and non-being originally are one,\nbefore the two names arose.\nLearners, if they rush in,\nwill find non-being not as precise as being.\n\nOnce the Dao is attained,\nboth being and non-being become perfect truths,\nwith no distinction between them.\n\nThis is the gateway to all subtleties.\nThe Dao contains two essences:\nwhen descending to form, Yang is exalted while Yin is humble;\nwhen ascending beyond form, Yin precedes while Yang follows.\n\nThus, when the Dao reaches its utmost, it is called *miao* and *xuan*.\n*Miao* refers to **virtue/power**,\n*Xuan* to **essence/color**.\nSpeaking of essence, one attains the Dao.\nYet there remains what essence cannot encompass,\nhence it is also called *xuan*.\nAll things possess their subtleties,\nall arising from this,\nso it is called the **gateway to all subtleties**.\n\nThe Dao is one,\nyet is spoken of as two.\nWhat is meant by these two?\nIt is being and non-being.\nNon-being is the Dao’s origin,\nwhile *miao* is the subtlety.\nBeing is the Dao’s culmination,\nwhile *jiao* is the coarse.\nThus, the Dao’s origin emerges from the **boundless void**,\nwhile its culmination disperses among forms, names, and measures.\n\nThese two, though one in Dao,\nare often mistaken as separate by the world.\nWhy?\nBecause the **boundless void** abides in non-being,\nwhile forms, names, and measures dwell in being.\nBeing and non-being cannot coexist,\nand this is why they are obscured and not fully grasped.\n\nThe unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nwhile the named is the mother of all things.\nThough they differ in name,\nthey never fail to serve one another.\n\nBeing and non-being, like east and west,\nare opposites yet cannot negate one another.\nThus, without being, there is no way to perceive non-being,\nand without non-being, there is no way to manifest being.\nThe transformations of being and non-being\nalternate and interweave without ever departing from the Dao—\nthis is what the sages call **divine**.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"No thought, no action—*\n*still and motionless,*\n*yet responsive and thus harmonizing*\n*with the workings of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThe sages of old\nobserved the **constant subtlety** through their **thoughtless stillness**,\nand the **coarse transformations** through their **responsive harmony**.\nWhen both the coarse and the subtle are attained without preference,\nwho else but the divine could achieve this?\n\nThus, the sages’ Dao is also evident.\nObserving the subtle exhausts the divine,\nwhile observing the coarse reveals its **manifestations**.\nTo exhaust the divine and know its manifestations,\nwhat more could be added to the Dao of Heaven and Earth?\n\nStill, observing the subtle is only to exhaust the divine,\nnot to define it.\nFor the divine never departs from these two,\nyet these two cannot fully name it.\nHence it is said:\n*\"Both arise from the same source yet differ in name.\nThe same is that they arise from the divine;\nthe different is that being and non-being have distinct names.\"*\n\nThe sage\nembodies this and manifests its divine virtue,\nso abiding in non-being reveals the subtle,\nwhile dwelling in being discerns the coarse.\nYet ultimately, they transcend the names of being and non-being.\n\nBelow the sage, some grasp Heaven and Earth’s origin,\nwhile others apply themselves to governing all things—\nall rely on this.\n\nAh! The words of Laozi can be said to accord with the *Yijing*.\nYet they ultimately do not align with Confucius and Mencius.\nWhy?\nFor the sage never sought to speak of the Dao.\nAll speech arises from responding to the world’s transformations,\nand is meant for those of middling talent who cannot fathom it on their own.\n\nThough the Dao encompasses both being and non-being,\nwhen spoken of, it elaborates on being while neglecting non-being.\nThe texts of *Shijing*, *Shujing*, *Liji*, *Yuelü*, and *Chunqiu*\nall serve to clarify being,\nwhile regarding non-being, only the *Yijing* speaks of it.\n\nYet even its discourse\nmust be embedded in the **hexagrams, trigrams, symbols, and systems**,\nin **auspicious and inauspicious**,\n**regret and blame**,\nso that scholars, when observing from above, see its meticulous attention to affairs and things,\nand grasp its **manifested being**;\nwhen observing from below, they perceive its transcendence of instruments and utility,\nand attain its **original non-being**.\n\nThus, the worthy study it and grow ever more confident,\nwhile the foolish glance at it and are not led to doubt or lose their way.\n\nFor their minds ponder:\n*\"That Dao of subtlety—*\n*the middling talents cannot reach it,*\n*and those who can reach it*\n*would not need words to explain it.*\nIf one does not measure it thus,\nand insists on speaking only of subtlety,\nthen one leaves learners seated in confusion.\"*\n\nLaozi understood the interplay of being and non-being,\nand thus regarded non-being as the origin,\nso his words elaborate on non-being while neglecting being.\nNon-being requires no words,\nyet he could speak elaborately of it.\n\nLaozi, differing from Confucius and Mencius,\nand Wang Bi losing the intent of Confucius—\nfor his teaching holds that the **unnamed** is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nyet the **divine** is what Heaven and Earth most struggle to name.\nOnce the world has named it as divine,\nhow could there be anything unnamed?\n\nAgain, Wang Bi asserts that one must observe through **constant desire** to see the coarse.\nBut desire is the **harm to nature**—\nthe *Yijing* says: *\"Restrain anger, suppress desire,\"*\nand Laozi says: *\"Do not see what can be desired,\nso the heart remains undisturbed.\"*\nIf desire exists,\nhow much more will one be **drowned in it, turned aside, lose oneself in pursuit of things,**\nand fail to know what to hold fast to?\nThen how could one observe the coarse?\n\nThis failure to discern\nleads him to say, *\"I know the fullness of Heaven and Earth,\nthe great framework of the ancients.\"*\nAlas, how laughable!\n\nLiu Zhongping said:\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken of is the mother of the Dao that cannot be spoken of.\"*\n\nThe **Taiji** depends upon the Dao.\nHeaven and Earth depend upon the myriad things.\nThe myriad things depend upon Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhat depends upon something is not the Dao itself—\nit is the accumulation of the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is **absolute non-being**, yet nameless.\n**Taiji** is **non-being**, yet nameless when detached from it.\nHeaven and Earth are **being**, yet named when entered.\n\n**Taiji** is obscure and divine—\nits name cannot be grasped—\nthis is the subtlety of the Dao.\n\nHeaven and Earth manifest in forms—\ntheir names can be carried—\nthis is the coarse of the Dao.\n\nBoth arise from speech.\nThe one who is **constantly without desire** observes it and sees only its subtlety.\nThe one who is **constantly with desire** observes it and sees only its coarse.\n\nOnly the one who is constantly without desire\ncan penetrate to the **mystic**.\n\nSome say: *\"This is not what is meant.\"*\nThey say that **non-being** names the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nwhile **being** names the mother of the myriad things.\nThey say that **constant non-being** is to observe its subtlety,\nwhile **constant being** is to observe its coarse.\n\nI say: *\"No. The reader errs.\"*\nIf **being** can name the mother of the myriad things,\nhow can **non-being** name the beginning of Heaven and Earth?\nIf **constant being** can observe its coarse,\nhow can **constant non-being** merely observe its subtlety?\n\nFor there is a beginning, there is an end—\nyet it cannot be called **non-being**.\n**Constant non-being** reaches **absolute non-being**—\nyet it cannot be called **being**.\n\nAh! To know this is to know the **mystic**.\n\n**Constant non-desire** is the gateway to the Dao.\n**Constant non-being, constant being**—\nspeaking of **being** and **non-being** in interplay,\none cannot take one side without the other.\n\n**Constant non-being** seeks to observe the Dao’s subtlety,\n**constant being** seeks to observe its coarse.\nSubtlety speaks of the root; coarse speaks of the branch.\nOnly when both root and branch are observed\ndoes one see the Dao.\n\nThe **constant name** has **no form** as its essence,\nthe **constant Dao** has **no essence** as its function.\n**No form** means it is nowhere absent,\n**no essence** means it does nothing absent.\nIf **no form** had anything that could be spoken of,\nit would not be **no form**.\nIf **no essence** had anything that could be named,\nit would not be **no essence**.\nThus it is said:\n*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao,*\n*The name that can be named is not the constant name.*\n\n**Tai’chu** has **being** and **non-being**—\n**non-being** has **non-being**, yet is nameless.\n**Non-being** that is nameless—this is **Taishǐ**.\n\n**Taishǐ** is the father of Heaven and Earth,\nthus it is called the **nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth**.\nHeaven and Earth are the mother of the myriad things,\nthus it is called the **named mother of the myriad things**.\n\nSpeaking of the mother, one knows the beginning as father;\nspeaking of the beginning, one knows the mother as origin.\nThus it is said above: *\"the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\"*\nand below: *\"the mother of the myriad things.\"*\n\nYet the principles of the world have\nthe Dao and the **constant Dao**,\nnames and the **constant name**.\n\nWhat is called **Tai’chu** having **being** and **non-being**—\nit is **non-being** alone.\nWhat is called **non-being** that is nameless—\nit is **name** alone.\nFor **being** and **non-being** give rise to the **name of name**,\nthus the **nameless** is only the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nAnd above this, there is the **Ancestor**.\n\nSubtlety is the root of the Dao;\ncoarse is the branch of the Dao.\nThe sage’s subtlety is observed through **constant non-being**.\nThe sage’s coarse is observed through **constant being**.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Observe its subtlety with constant non-desire,\nobserve its coarse with constant desire.\"*\n\nSubtlety lies within; coarse lies in the branch.\nSpeaking of subtlety reveals the coarse as coarse,\nspeaking of the coarse reveals the subtlety as central.\nThus it is said above: *\"observe its subtlety,\"*\nand below: *\"observe its coarse.\"*\n\nFor **non-being** is **non-being** opposed to **being**,\nwhile **constant non-being** is not **non-being** opposed to **being**,\nnor is it opposed to **being**.\n\n**Being** is **being** opposed to **non-being**,\nwhile **constant being** is not **being** opposed to **non-being**,\nnor is it opposed to **non-being**.\n\nWhat is not opposed to **non-being** is not **being**,\nwhat is not opposed to **being** is not **non-being**.\nThus **constant being** is **true non-being**—\nyet not **non-being**.\n**Constant being** is **subtle being**—\nyet not **being**.\n\nThus these two arise together and return to the **mystic**.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Establish it with **constant non-being**,\nspeak of it with **Tai’yi**.\"*\n\nThis is read as **constant non-being, constant being**.\n**Constant non-being** seeks to observe its subtlety,\n**constant being** seeks to observe its coarse.\nBecause it seeks to observe its subtlety,\nit is established with **constant non-being**.\nBecause it seeks to observe its coarse,\nit is established with **constant being**.\n\nIf both coarse and subtlety are forgotten,\nand there is no desire to observe,\nthen what is called *\"established with constant non-being\"*\nis simply **obscured**.\n\nThis is called **the mystic again**—\nnot merely the same as the **mystic**.\n*The mystic, the mystic again*—\nthe gateway of all subtleties.\n\nThe **mystic** is the essence of subtlety;\nsubtlety is the function of the **mystic**.\nSubtlety arises from what is not the **mystic**.\n\nLiu Jujie said:\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\"*\nThe Dao meets speech—\nthen its being the Dao is enough, yet it is not the **constant Dao**.\nThe **constant Dao** has no limits—\nthis is what is called **constant non-desire**.\nThe Dao has no limits—\nthis is what is called **constant desire**.\n\nWhen the world’s Dao is lost,\nLaozi governs the One to save it—\nits adaptation to things is appropriate,\nnot clinging to the old,\nto harmonize the world’s transformations.\n\nThe name that can be named is not the **constant name**—\nif forced to name it, call it **Great**,\nthen this name is **Great**.\n**Great** is a name; **Dao** is a character.\nThe **constant name** has no limits—\nno limits mean no name.\nThe name that can be named has no limits—\nno limits mean it has a name.\n\nThe **mystic** of name and character—\nis it not here?\n\nThe **nameless** is the mother of the **Dao that cannot be spoken of**.\nThis speaks only of name, not of Dao.\nSince name extends to character,\nthe **nameless** is also seen.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s beginning—\nvastly obscure and unified—\nthen where are the so-called name and character?\n\nOnce names and characters exist,\nthen adaptation to things is appropriate—\nthings arise from what is appropriate,\nand from what is appropriate comes what is possible,\nuntil what is possible becomes what is actual.\nThus, the Dao is the mother of all things.\n\n**Constantly without desire**, one observes its **boundaries**.\n**Constantly without desire** is the same as the **constant Dao**;\n**constantly with desire** is the same as the **possible Dao**.\n\nWhen one is in **constant impossibility**, it is called **constant without desire**;\nwhen one is in **constant possibility**, it is called **constant with desire**.\n\nFor the text below speaks of **constant without name** but not **constant without desire**,\nspeaks of **my without desire** but not **desire without desire**—\ndesire, if it exists, is never **constant**.\n\nTo observe the **mystic** through **constant without desire**,\nthat is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nto observe the **boundaries** through **constant with desire**,\nthat is the mother of all things.\n\nWhat is called **observation** is the mind’s eye,\nnot merely the force of sight.\n\nThese two are called **mystic**.\n**Without desire** and **with desire**—\nthough their names differ,\ntheir essence arises from the same Dao.\nFor **impossibility** and **constant** are both the Dao.\n\n**Mystic**—\nobscure, dim, profound, and boundless—\nis the hue of the Dao.\nThe Yellow Emperor said:\nIn Heaven, it is **mystic**; in humans, it is **Dao**.\n\nThe Dao, when seen, is unseen yet has hue—\nthe Sage observes its **mystic** and its **boundaries**,\nand thus speaks of it.\n\nWhen called the same, it is **mystic**;\n**mystic**, it can be spoken of—\nthe **constant Dao** and the **possible Dao** depend on each other.\n\n**Mystic beyond mystic**—\nthe gateway to all **wonders**.\n\nAgain, **mystic**—\nform and hue are not hue;\nnothing can be observed of it.\n\n**Mystic of mystic** and **again mystic of mystic**—\nnot hue, yet they depend on each other,\nnot discarding the earlier **mystic** as a burden.\n\n**All wonders**—\nthe **wonders** of all things.\nAll things possess **wonders**, all arising from the Dao—\nthus, the Dao is the **wonder** of all things.\n\nHere, **boundaries** are not mentioned,\nfor **wonders** and **boundaries** are not discarded as burdens.\n\nLiu Ji said:\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is the gateway to what can be attained.\n**Dao** speaks of its **body**; **name** speaks of its **function**.\n\nWhat can be spoken of and named\nis like the myriad schools and arts—\neach has its strengths, its uses in time,\nyet does not encompass all;\nit is not the **true constant**.\n\nSpeaking of **constant Dao** and **constant name**—\nself-originating, self-rooted—\nbefore Heaven and Earth existed,\nit has eternally endured.\nThe divine and spirits, the divine and emperors,\nthose who give birth to Heaven and Earth—\nwho can know the **Dao that can be spoken of**,\nthe **name that can be named**?\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe Great Dao is formless,\ngiving birth to Heaven and Earth.\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed,\nwho could name it?\nThus, it is **nameless**, the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe Great Dao is **nameless**, yet nourishes all things.\nWhen all things exist,\nthere are forms that can be named—\nthus, there is **name**, the mother of all things.\n\n**Nameless** is the **mystic** of the Dao—\nwithout action, without form,\nthus **constant without desire** to observe its **mystic**.\n\n**Named** is the **boundaries** of the Dao—\nwith emotion, with sincerity,\nthus **constant with desire** to observe its **boundaries**.\n\nThe scholar must enter **without** from **with**,\nunwinding to reach **mystic**,\nseeking origin and end—\nnever truly different.\n\nThus, emerging with different names,\nyet called the same—**mystic**.\n\n**Mystic**—\nthe hue of Heaven,\nthat which is distant without limit.\n\n**Mystic beyond mystic**—\nthen the divine beyond the divine,\nprofound beyond the profound,\nentering the gate of the boundless,\nwandering in the wild of the limitless,\nmatching the function of the void—\nall **wonders** arise from this.\n\nThus, it is called the **gateway to all wonders**,\nthe source of all things,\nthe dependence of transformation.\n\nWho can exit without passing through the door?\nHow could one not pass through this Dao?\n\nThe people can be led by it,\nbut cannot be made to know it.\nKnowledge is shallow;\nignorance is profound.\nKnowledge is external;\nignorance is internal—\nthus, it follows with *all under Heaven know*.\n\n---\n*End of Volume One of the Collected Meanings of the Dao-De Jing*\n*Beginning of Volume Two of the Collected Meanings of the Dao-De Jing*\n\n**The Dao That Can Be Spoken of**\n\nMaster Zhi of the Concentrated Dao declares:\n*\"The Way of Eternal Virtue is a Mystic Vision.\"*\n\n**Chapter on the Dao That Can Be Spoken of**\nZhao Shizhan says:\n\n1. **Transcending Form to Manifest the True**\n   The Dao that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao.\n   The Dao that can be spoken of is the realm of *form and lower things*.\n   The Eternal Dao is the realm of *formless and higher things*.\n\n   In the realm of *form and lower things*, the Dao is dispersed among shapes, names, measures, and calculations.\n   In the realm of *formless and higher things*, the Dao is concealed in the void, emptiness, stillness, and boundlessness.\n\n   If one seeks the Dao through objects, the Dao cannot be grasped—\n   for its inability to be grasped, forms and instruments are not the Dao.\n   If one observes the Dao apart from objects, the Dao has no fixed attributes—\n   for its lack of fixed attributes, its divine mysteries are boundless.\n\n   The heart is the substance of the Dao;\n   the Dao and the heart are not distinct.\n   Nature is the origin of the heart;\n   the heart and nature are not different.\n   The heart and nature—\n   the formless in form.\n   The Dao and the heart—\n   the formless yet manifest.\n\n   The heart, nature, and Dao—\n   though spoken as three, they are one.\n   Being, non-being, and unity—\n   though divided into three, they converge as one.\n\n   One is said to be *numbers*—\n   yet the Dao is not *numbers*!\n   One is said to be *mystery*—\n   yet the Dao is not separate from *numbers*!\n   Mystery is formless—\n   yet the Dao cannot be confined by words!\n\n   Its manifestation is clarity;\n   all things are without exception in the Dao.\n   Thus, even the Dao that can be spoken of,\n   though it may be spoken of, still holds the Eternal Dao within it.\n   The Eternal Dao, though it transcends what can be spoken of,\n   yet the Dao that can be spoken of is rooted in it.\n\n   If one distinguishes between true and false in form,\n   the true is the Eternal Dao,\n   while the false is the Dao that can be spoken of.\n   If one distinguishes between emptiness and reality,\n   the Dao is the substance of true nature,\n   while things are illusory manifestations.\n\n   Let us illustrate with practical principles,\n   perhaps this will yield some understanding.\n\n   Though called *eternal*, change is inherent.\n   Thus, when we speak of *eternal*,\n   it refers to the realm of nature,\n   the heart to the function of the Dao—\n   together, they are called *eternal*.\n   The substance of *eternal* is taken from its unchanging aspect;\n   for its unchanging aspect, it is called *eternal*.\n   From the Eternal Dao flow all things.\n\n   Again, *eternal* is great—\n   thus, when viewed from this perspective, is it not great?\n   *Eternal* is the radiant function of the Sage.\n   To speak of *eternal* is not to exclude the Dao;\n   to speak of the Dao is not to exclude *eternal*—\n   what is called *eternal* is the Dao,\n   and the Dao is *eternal*.\n   If one must speak of the Dao without mentioning *eternal*,\n   how can the Eternal Dao be fixed as one?\n   If one must speak of *eternal* without mentioning the Dao,\n   how can the Dao be displayed in its fullness?\n\n   *Eternal* abides eternally;\n   the eternal abides in unchanging constancy.\n   *Communicating* flows through all things;\n   the communicating flows without end.\n\n   One substance, two functions—\n   yet one substance encompasses both change and constancy.\n   Heaven is not eternal?\n   The Nine Heavens reach their limit, yet Heaven sometimes alters.\n   Earth is not eternal?\n   The Six Directions reach their limit, yet Earth sometimes emerges.\n   The sun is not eternal?\n   It sometimes wanes.\n   The moon is not eternal?\n   It sometimes eclipses.\n\n   The *Qian* (Heaven) above the Nine Heavens has no head,\n   the *Peng* (Great Bird) rests only at the Sixth Month—\n   thus, those who cling to form and *numbers* must have limits.\n   Only the *eternal* has no form,\n   no form means no *numbers*,\n   no *numbers* means no generation,\n   no generation means no annihilation.\n\n   From Heaven and Earth down to all things,\n   they are all of *form and numbers*—\n   how could they be the same as my True Eternal Dao?\n\n   Thus, it is said:\n   The Dao that can be spoken of is not my Eternal Dao.\n\n   Is *eternal* not change?\n   To call it *eternal* without change—is that possible?\n   Is change not *eternal*?\n   To call it change without constancy—is that possible?\n\n   When things are born,\n   *eternal* is with them in their birth.\n   When things transform,\n   *eternal* is with them in their transformation.\n   Born yet not born,\n   *eternal* flows without obstruction.\n   Transformed yet not transformed,\n   *eternal* remains as it is.\n\n   Self-born, self-transformed—\n   without the True Eternal Dao, how could birth and transformation occur?\n   Eternally born, eternally transformed—\n   this is the True Eternal Dao, which ceaselessly generates and transforms.\n\n   Flowing, dispersing, shifting—\n   it does not cling to any fixed *eternal* state.\n   Waning and waxing, full and empty—\n   it does not adhere to any fixed principle,\n   yet it encompasses all forms without being seen,\n   abides in one nature eternally.\n   Exhausted, it transforms;\n   transformed, it flows.\n   The great person adapts to the times through this.\n\n   If useful, then follow;\n   if not, then abandon—\n   the Sage knows transformation through this.\n\n   When applied to the world,\n   it is called the *divine instrument*.\n   When practiced for the benefit of all things,\n   it is called *enlightened authority*.\n   When pondered to its utmost elemental principle,\n   it is called *subtle mystery*.\n   When wielded in accordance with yin-yang,\n   it is called *divine mechanism*.\n\n   As for Yao’s use of it—*benevolence*;\n   Shun’s use of it—*filial piety*;\n   Yu’s use of it—*channeling the rivers and streams*;\n   Tang’s use of it—*ascending to sage-like reverence*.\n   Though their uses differ,\n   their essence is one.\n\n   Only those virtuous rulers who do not share the Sage’s concerns\n   can truly embody the *eternal*—\n   for they alone understand its substance.\n\n2. **Transcending Names to Manifest Reality**\n   Names can be named,\n   yet they are not the Eternal Names.\n   What can be named with names\n   still has form.\n   The Dao being formless,\n   how could it be named?\n\n   The *Classic* says: *Not the Eternal Name*.\n   What can be named is not my Eternal Name—\n   yet the Eternal also has a name.\n\n   The Eternal is without generation;\n   generation is matter—\n   all matter can be named.\n   The Eternal is without use;\n   use is action—\n   all actions can be named.\n   Yet to investigate the origin of generation,\n   the ancestor of all actions,\n   one finds it cannot be seen.\n\n   Liezi says:\n   *\"When the Dao is fully applied, it fills the six voids;\n   when it is discarded, no one knows its whereabouts.\"*\n\n   The Dao has unity and dispersion,\n   nature has interaction and distinction—\n   the formless unites with the formless,\n   the formless enters the formless without obstruction.\n   Its spirit soars like lightning,\n   its motion is swift as a drawn arrow—\n   how could one trace its path?\n\n   This is the Dao that cannot be named.\n   Thus, unity is oneness of substance.\n   This unity is unity with the Great Void.\n\n   Dispersion is the origin of all things;\n   from the formless arises the form.\n   The ungenerated can generate all things—\n   vital essence contains *qi*, nurtures life—\n   how could one be ignorant of this?\n\nThis dispersion is dispersion into myriad things to form shape—this can be named.\nThe Dao generates yang in the child [position], the child’s beauty appears in the southeast—thus the Dao emerges and interacts with things.\nThe Dao generates yin in the noon [position], the noon’s beauty exhausts in the northwest—this is the Dao’s return and its distinction of things.\nWhen interacting with things, its manifestation is manifest—then the names of myriad things are naturally bestowed.\nWhen distinguishing things, its concealment is concealed—then the origin of the One Truth is unseen.\n\nTo name the unseeable as the constant name, the nameable yet cannot be unified;\nTo name the seen as nameable, then the constant name also cannot be pursued.\nEmerging from darkness and entering darkness—this supreme Dao is indeed mysterious.\nWho names it? Who does not name it?\n\nNext, dividing the two: having and not having.\n\n**One: The Great Void originates One.**\nWithout name, the beginning of heaven and earth—with the Dao residing in the utmost void and profound obscurity,\ndeep as if eternally existing, not entangled with any thing.\nAll that has form are not the Dao’s constant Way.\nNext, speaking of the non-constant name—since names exist between form, substance, and measure,\naccording to their beauty or ugliness, no thing lacks a name.\nAll that can be named are not the Dao’s constant name.\nWithout name, the beginning of heaven and earth.\nWith name, the mother of myriad things.\nEarlier, speaking of the non-constant name—this means the constant has not departed from name.\nNow speaking of the without-name—using the character *wu* (無) to break the constant character.\nWithout name, the beginning of heaven and earth.\nThe without-name is the constant Dao.\nThe constant Dao is the without-name.\nWhy speak of one principle in two ways?\nBecause the Dao cannot be spoken—those who speak of it never truly reach it.\nThe Dao originally has no name; those who name it never fully grasp its essence.\nIt must be spoken of as the non-constant constant—indeed, twofold speech.\nThe constant Dao and constant name—speaking of its ineffable without-name,\nand speaking of its nameable use.\n\nThe without-name generates heaven and earth; the nameable begets myriad things—\nall to display its function.\nThe essence of the supreme Dao is deep as the Great Void,\nno thing generated, no name obtained—\nat the utmost stillness, stillness generates motion,\nthus the One *qi* unfurls like a brushstroke as the origin of things—\ncalled \"touching\" yet not touching, called \"responding\" yet not responding,\nrooted in void transformation, spirit generating *qi*.\nThe principle of generation unfolds here.\nThe Dao generates One; One is the beginning—\nthe spirit of myriad forms is thus evenly bestowed.\nThe \"having\" is not truly having—this is One yet unformed;\nthe \"not having\" is not truly not having—this is the initial form,\nlike the moon’s shadow in *guàn* (艮).\nLike a trickle’s source, gradually forming heaven and earth—\nwho embodies transformation? This is the non-doing that does.\nNow, the without-form is the marvelous—all laws return to rest;\nthe with-form is false—ordinary people taste it.\nThe Dao hidden is without use yet achieves use—\nachieving use, *qi* comes first.\nThe law arises, using the law yet never exhausted—\nthe Original Beginning is boundless.\nOne, though falling into numbers, harmonizes with numbers—then eternal life.\nThe beginning has form; refining the form, one does not die.\nWater one, fire two, wood three, metal four, earth five—\nthese are the generating numbers of the Five Phases.\nNine wood, three fire, seven metal, five water, ten earth—\nthese are the initial numbers of the Five Phases.\nIf one obtains their initial state, then knows the metal-wood inheriting the Original,\nmerging their completion reveals the life-death of water-fire.\nWood follows the child’s return to *shēn* (申), thus beginning to dwell in the womb.\n*Qián* (乾) heaven belongs to metal, the east, and its governing function—\nthus all six lines are nine, aligning with wood’s shared origin,\nlodging in the metal direction, embodying a family’s marvelous function.\nWhen metal comes to invade and occupy the *yín* (寅) position,\nwith the seven *qi* of *yīn-yūn* (氤氲) heaven,\ndwelling in the three yang and receiving conception—\nuntil fire, emerging from *duì* (兑) in the *hài* (亥) position,\nobtaining three water, earth, and *guàn* (艮),\narising in the *xùn* (巽) direction—\nits omens then appear in *yín-shēn-wèi-hài* (寅申巳亥).\nThe *Nǚtái* says: \"This is the beginning,\" yet the *qi* does not congeal—\nform and substance are fully refined here,\ngenerating without interruption—thus differing from the *Hong Fan*.\nGeneration has conflict, yet also harmonious principle.\nFrom the *Xian Jing*.\n\nOne follows the Original and does not terminate—thus called \"beginning,\" emerging from the without-name.\n\n**Two: The Great Ultimate generates Three.**\nWith name, the mother of myriad things.\nThe beginning is the origin—\nbefore its generation is seen.\nThe generating is the mother—\nthings generate, then forms appear;\nforms appear, then nourishment arises;\nnourishment arises, then numbers emerge—this is the nameable.\nThe Classic begins with the without-name as the origin,\nand the nameable as the generating—thus the non-existent becomes existent.\n*The Er Ya* says: *Zhào* (肇), *zǔ* (祖), *yuán* (元), *tāi* (胎)—these are \"beginning.\"\nThe *Kūn* hexagram embodies earth’s Dao, wife’s Dao, subject’s Dao—mother’s Dao.\n*Qián* begins it; *kūn* generates it—\nthus, pairing husband and wife brings forth male and female;\nwith male and female, the name of mother first becomes clear.\nThus, first speaking of beginning, then speaking of mother—\nfourfold explanations arise:\nOne through yin-yang, two through heaven-earth,\nthree through father-mother, four through having-not-having.\nYin-yang is *qi*; *qi* is the division of yin-yang.\nInitially, one *qi* unfurls—originally without yin-yang.\nWhen the Great Ultimate generates one *qi*,\nthe light and clear ascend to form heaven,\nthe heavy and turbid descend to form earth.\nAgain, the *Kāi Tiān Jīng* says: \"When heaven’s *qi* is sufficient, the surplus becomes earth.\"\nSpeaking of sufficiency reveals yin-yang has fixed numbers—\nnumbers are complete, then divided.\nIn the *Hun Yuan* era, though yin-yang existed,\nrefinement was not yet extreme, mixed yet undivided—\nthus *Liezi* says: \"The *qi* and form are complete yet not separated\"—\nthis is the \"mixed and turbid.\"\nAgain, the Original Beginning, with the Primordial Three *qi*,\ngenerates thirty-six heavens above and thirty-six earths below—\nabove and below merge their virtue to form yin-yang.\n\n「Again, the clear is the source of the turbid—this is seen in the *Qīng Jìng Jīng* [\"Scripture of Pure Stillness\"];\nthe yin is the nourishment of the yang—this is seen in the *Shēng Shén Zhāng* [\"Chapter on the Spirit of Birth\"].\n\nFrom this, it may be observed that yin-yang originates from one *qi* yet divides itself into two,\nhence the saying: *\"Merge and then divide\"*—the beginning of heaven and earth.\nOriginally, there are no parents;\nthey are born within the Great Emptiness (*Tàixū*), void and boundless,\nconceived within the Primordial Chaos (*Hùndùn*), one *qi* undivided—\ntheir form is like a chicken’s egg: yellow within, white without.\nBefore their division, heaven and earth are nurtured in the Soul’s Source (*Língyuán*).\nWhen they divide, above and below are distinguished as heaven and earth.\n\nThree *qi* merge to form *virtue* (*dé*), accumulating to nine for the yang.\nOnce the nine yang *qi* ascend, the surplus becomes earth.\nThus, heaven has nine heavens, earth has nine earths—\nthe Great Luo (*Dàluó*) forms the thirty-six heavens,\nthe three palaces of Metal, Fire, and Earth complete the merged numbers.\n\nThe Middle Luo (*Zhōngluó*) forms thirty-six heavens,\ncombining with thirty-two heavens—\nthe numbers of the Four Beginnings (*Sìshǐ*) arise.\n\nThe *Jiùkǔ Jīng* [\"Scripture of Saving Suffering\"] states:\n*\"Thirty-six above, thirty-six below—\nthis is heaven’s birth and earth’s completion,\nuniting heaven and earth’s numbers,\ntotaling seventy-two as the seasonal markers,\nfulfilling the beginning and the end.\"*\n\nHeaven and earth are the manifested symbols (*chéngxiàng*) of the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way has no abode, yet it abides in heaven and earth.\nHeaven and earth have no abode, yet they abide in the *Kàn* [\"Receptive\"] and *Kūn* [\"Comprehensive\"].\nThus, heaven is called father, earth is called mother—\nheaven and earth merge from one *qi* to give birth to all things,\nacting as father and mother.\n\nThe *Kàn* aspect pertains to the beginning (*shǐ*),\nthe *Kūn* aspect pertains to birth (*shēng*),\nfor the Dao/Way of beginning and birth is one.\nIs it not that the form of heaven is male and the form of earth is female?\n\nThose who grasp the meaning forget the symbols,\nthose who grasp the symbols forget the words—\nif one has not yet grasped the meaning and symbols,\nhow can one exhaust their truth?\n\nThus, when discussing heaven and earth through one *qi*,\nit is akin to the *Kàn* aspect dividing into spirit and matter—\nthis is the *\"merge and then divide.\"*\n\nFrom this, it may be observed that the Dao/Way is the mother of heaven and earth,\nand heaven and earth are the mothers of all things—\nthus it may be understood.\n\nThis is the *\"divide and then merge\"*—\nthe *Kàn* aspect as heaven and father,\nthe *Kūn* aspect as earth and mother.\nFrom heaven to earth, eighty-four thousand *lǐ* [leagues],\nand from earth to heaven, likewise.\n\nWhen discussing the trigrams’ symbols (*guàxiàng*),\nthe *Fù* [\"Return\"] to *Tài* [\"Great\"] is three yin and three yang—\nthe *Kàn* below and *Kūn* above is the time of heaven and earth’s harmonious exchange (*jiāotài*).\nThe *Yì* [\"Changes\"] says: *\"When male and female merge their essence, all things transform and are born\"*—\nthis is the *Tài* [\"Great\"].\n\nThe *Tài* [\"Great\"] is the *Zhōnghé* [\"Central Harmony\"].\nWithin this, there is a *chōngqì* [\"colliding/central *qi*\"].\nDark and obscure, vague and indistinct—\nhere, the utmost truth (*Zhìzhēn*) converges,\nthis being the intent of all things containing life.\n\nYet, when heaven and earth are measured by eighty-four thousand *lǐ*,\nthe half-yin within yang is the spring equinox (*Chūnfēn*),\nthe half-yang within yin is the autumn equinox (*Qiūfēn*—\nthis too is the symbol of male and female union.\n\nThough heaven is distant from earth and earth from heaven,\nwithout the *qi*’s exchange and harmony (*jiāohé*),\nhow could they be called parents?\nHow could there be the principle of life and birth?\n\nThus, before division, it is called Primordial Chaos (*Hùndùn*),\nafter division, it is distinguished as yin-yang,\ndiffering essences merge as male and female,\nand marriage unites them as husband and wife.\nThe *Yì* [\"Changes\"] says: *\"Only after male and female does husband and wife exist.\"*\n\nThus, the mother is taken to speak of birth.\nThe *virtue* (*dé*) that exists yet is empty—\nthis is the reverse of things;\nthe *power* (*shén*) that exists yet is none—\nthis is the origin of truth.\n\nThe nameless is the origin of true emptiness (*Zhēnkōng*),\nthe named is the wondrous application of things (*Miàoyǒng*).\nYet if the truth is without form (*wú*),\nwhy wait for form to display its wonder?\n\nOne *qi* divides itself, the Three Powers (*Sāncái*) distinguish themselves,\nall things take root naturally—\nwho directs this? Who sustains this?\nThis is called *Zìrán* [\"Self-So/Naturalness\"].\n\nIf discussing the *Shǐ* [\"Making\"] that causes this,\nthe *virtue* (*dé*) that has its own source is so,\nthe *power* (*shén*) that lacks its own source is not—\nhow could one escape heaven’s unfolding and earth’s completion,\nyin’s merging and yang’s interfacing?\n\nWithout the mother, how could birth be displayed?\nWithout birth, how could one be called mother?\nThe *Scripture* says: *\"The Dao/Way gives birth to it\"*—\nthus the Dao/Way is the mother of all things.\n\nEntering without exit, existing without form—\nas if there were a mechanism yet unable to act on its own.\nThe duality of having and not having,\nif not the Dao/Way, then who?\n\nEstablishing the name \"mother,\" the void emerges as reality (*shí*),\nestablishing the beginning (*shǐ*), reality returns to the void.\nOne having, one not having—\nthe Dao/Way’s wondrous application.\nThe origin of the none—\none must recognize the Great Emptiness (*Tàixū*),\nthe function of returning—\nits essence lies within the mother.\n\nThe numbers of heaven and earth,\nfive *Kàn* and ten *Lí* [\"Fire\"]—\nfive times five is the mother,\nscattering to give birth to all things—\nthis is called *Miàoyǒu* [\"Wondrous Possession\"].\n\nAs in the case of six *Wù* [\"Not Yet\"] added to *Kàn*,\nsix *Jǐ* [\"Already\"] added to *Lí* [\"Fire\"]—\nthe principle of life and birth is thus revealed.\n\nThree distinctions (*Sānbàn*) manifest two bodies (*tǐ*).\nFirst: **Stillness and Reflection (*Jìngzhào*) as the constant form (*Chángtǐ*)**.\nConstantly without desire to observe its wonder—\nthe Dao/Way that may be spoken of is not the constant Dao/Way,\nthe name that may be named is not the constant name—\npointing to the constant Dao/Way and constant name is to exhaust the wonder.\n\nIt cannot be seen, cannot be heard—\nit causes people to abandon sight and sound beyond names and words,\nthis being not attainable by those with intent.\nOnly those without intent may comprehend it—\nthus it is called the *constant Dao/Way*.\n\nNext: **The nameless beginning of heaven and earth, the named mother of all things—**\nspeaking of the Dao/Way’s wondrous application.\nThe first four sentences speak of wonder (*miào*),\nthe last two reveal its application (*yòng*).\n\nTo speak of wonder yet not of application,\nthe Dao/Way has no display.\nTo speak of application yet not of wonder,\naffairs may obstruct the principle.\n\nMoreover, all things receive their mandate from the none (*wú*),\nyet take form in the having (*yǒu*).\nThe principle is thus again confirmed,\nand the sages perceive it—\nthis lies in the seen and the seeing.\n\nThe Dao/Way has no color or form (*sèxiàng*),\nthe truth transcends names and words (*Míngyán*).\nDelving deeply, one’s essence is perfected beyond the heart (*wúxīn*),\none’s destination is exhausted in reality (*shíqù*).\nSince the void and none (*Xūwú*) is the Dao/Way,\nwhy cling to things’ forms and appearances (*xiàngyīn*)?\nTo not abandon perception and hearing,\nhow could one return to purity and stillness?\n\nPurity and stillness (*Qīngjìng*) are the root of nature (*xìng*),\ncolor and form (*sèxiàng*) are the cause of names (*míng*).\nNature’s root is serene and pure (*zhànrán*),\nneither name nor form.\nSeparating from nature while forms arise—\nthis is delusion, this is emptiness (*wàngwú*).\nThus names arise from the body and form,\nforms arise from the mind’s perception (*niànxīn*),\ntruth and falsehood stand opposed—\nthe Dao/Way’s origin is difficult to trace.»\n\nThe **Dao/Way** (*Zhuāngzǐ*) speaks of the **Mystery of Mysteries** (*Xuánxuán*): since all things arise from the void and none (*Xūwú*), yet take form in the manifest (*yǒuxiàng*), the **Mystery** (*Lǐ*) is thus established, and the **Sage** (*Shèngrén*) perceives it, abiding in perception and awareness (*cúnxū jiànjiàn*). The **Dao/Way** is without color and form (*wú sèxiàng*), true beyond names and words (*zhēn jué míngyán*), its essence exhausted in the heartless (*wúxīn*), its destination fulfilled in the real (*shíqù*). Since the void and none is the **Dao/Way**, why cling to things’ forms and appearances (*xiàngyīn*)? To not abandon perception and hearing (*bù jué jiànwén*), how could one return to purity and stillness (*Qīngjìng*)?\n\nPurity and stillness (*Qīngjìng*) are the root of nature (*xìng*), color and form (*sèxiàng*) the cause of names (*míng*). Nature’s root is serene and pure (*zhànrán*), neither name nor form. When form arises without nature—this is delusion, this is emptiness (*wàngwú*). Thus names arise from the body and form, forms from the mind’s perception (*niànxīn*), truth and falsehood stand opposed—yet the **Dao/Way**’s origin remains unfathomable (*nán yuán*).\n\n---\n\n**Thus**, the one who composes the **Scriptures** (*Jīng*) must uphold the void and none (*Xūwú*), while the seeker of **Mystery** (*Lǐ*) must observe color and form (*sèxiàng*). Through the void, one perceives reality (*jiàn shí*), from delusion and illusion (*huànwàng*), one knows the return (*zhī guī*). From none (*wú*) comes the having (*yǒu*), refined thought coalescing with dust to achieve completion (*jīng xiǎng chén ér chéngjiù*). Things lack inherent nature (*wú zìxìng*), hence the saying of the void (*yú wú yǒu yán*). The **Dao/Way** is nameless (*wú míng*), for it is not color. This is **Zhuāngzi**’s teaching: **\"Before the having (*yǒu*), there was the none (*wú*), and before the none, there was the none\"** (*Wèi shǐ yǒu fū, wèi shǐ yǒu wú yě zhě*).\n\n**Second**, the **Way**’s constant and transformative application (*Cháng*). The **Sage** seeks its subtle essence (*miào*) through desireless observation (*wúyù guān qù*). The **Dao/Way** itself does not generate, nor is its none (*wú*) not the **Dao/Way**. The **Dao/Way** descends into things (*wù*), yet things are never not true (*wù wú fēi zhēn*). When things return to the **Dao/Way**, the **Dao/Way** does not claim dominion over them. The **Dao/Way**’s true constancy (*Zhēncháng*) is effortlessly free (*tuōrán wú lèi*), yet how can one speak of the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) as a mere sweeping vision (*fànjǐng*), a single *qi* spontaneously arising (*yī qì zì shēng*)?\n\nThe **Mystery** (*Xuán*) coalesces with true essence (*Zhēn*), and the **Three Powers** (*Sāncái*—Heaven, Earth, and Man) manifest their concrete forms and symbols (*xìngxiàng*) in Heaven. Then the **Six Qi** (*Liùqì*—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Void) circulate and gather to form shapes (*huí bóbó chéngxíng*) upon Earth. The **Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) generate and transform, while **Yin** and **Yang** govern their grand cycles (*Yīnyáng zǒng qí dàshù*). The **Eight Trigrams** (*Bāguà*) are fixed by the **Four Seasons** (*Sìshí*), with standards both constant (*yǒucháng*) and ever-changing (*biànhuà bùyǐ*), in life and death (*yī shēng yī miè*), as the **Mystery** (*Lǐ*) of things inherently is (*zài wù lǐ zhī gùrán*).\n\nThe **Dao/Way**’s **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is undying and unborn (*bùsǐ bùshēng*), its governance refined through **Yin** and **Yang** (*yīnyáng zhī zhèngmiào*). Those who grasp this **Dao/Way** belong to the **Perfect Ones** (*Zhìrén*). To fail in understanding the origin of life (*wèi dá shēngyuán*), yet to cling to illusion and extinction (*tú guī huànmiè*), is to not exhaust the **Mystery** (*Bù qióng zàohuà*)—this is the **Way**’s direct pointing to **Rest** (*Xiū*) and **Floating** (*Fú*), unaware of the **Mystery** (*Shù*) in death. When things lose their **Spirit** (*Shén*), their forms are not burdened by the **Mystery** (*Shù*). Those who exhaust the **Mystery** (*Shù*) recognize that **Void** (*Kōng*) is not truly void, nor **Form** (*Sè*) truly form. This is the work of the **Inverted Observer** (*Nì guān zhě*).\n\n**Void** (*Xuán*) is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*). Earlier, it was said that having and none arise from the same **Mystery** (*Tǐ*), so one cannot distinguish them as having and none (*bù dé yǐ yǒu wú ér shū guān*). Later, the teaching is strictly sealed, hence the saying: **\"Void is the **Mystery**\"** (*Tóng wèi zhī xuán*). The character *tóng* (同) is composed of *yī* (一, \"one\") and *kǒu* (口, \"mouth\"), yet both are one in right and wrong (*yī zhě shìfēi, yī zhě shìfēi*). Thus, if they do not share the same *kǒu*, then right and wrong are the same. Hence, the **Great Unity** (*Dàtóng*) transcends humanity (*lí rén*).\n\nTo transcend humanity is to enter Heaven (*rù tiān*), and to enter Heaven is to align with the **Dao/Way** (*tóng dào*), which is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*). This is the **Great Unity** (*Dàtóng*). The **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of having and none (*Yǒu wú èr lǐ*) is the same, yet the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is spoken of as void (*wú*), making it subtle yet unseen (*miào ér bù kě jiàn*). Thus, the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is also seen through having (*yǒu*), how could it be said that the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is not the same? All things arise from having within none (*wú zhōng chū yǒu*), and none is contained within having (*yǒu zhōng hán wú*), rooted in the same nature (*bēn yī xìng*). Why then distinguish them as different?\n\n「Yet the nature of the **Great Unity** (*Dàtóng*) is first revealed through the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of transcending form and emptiness (*bèi sèkōng*), and further through the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of surpassing having and none (*lí yǒuwú*). Thus, its meaning becomes gradually clear.\n\nTo awaken is to perceive the **Dao/Way** in every aspect (*tóutóu shì dào*), while to be deluded is to see distinctions in all phenomena (*mí shì jiànjiàn jiē shū*). To regard death and life as one thread (*yī tiáo*), and to treat the acceptable and unacceptable as a single passage (*yī guàn*), only then can one attain **equality and wisdom** (*píngděng xìngzhì*) to enter it.\n\n**Yuè Jiě** says: *\"Subtle yet minute is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\"*\nThe **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is the essence of Heaven (*tiān zhī sè*).\nThe *Book of Meaning* (*Shūyì*) states: *\"Subtle yet minute is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), vast yet responsive is called **exalted** (*jùn*).\"*\nWhen **virtue/power** (*dé*) is concealed, it is subtle yet minute—this is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\nWhen **virtue/power** (*dé*) is manifested, it becomes vast yet responsive—this is **exalted** (*jùn*).\nThus, among the **Sages** (*shèngrén*), when **virtue/power** (*dé*) is in the lower realm, it is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), and when in the higher realm, it is called **exalted** (*jùn*).\n*\"Subtle yet minute\"* is indeed the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), yet it is difficult to speak of.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** has no form or appearance (*wú xíngxiàng*), so who can distinguish its vastness and minuteness?\nThe **Dao/Way** is vast as Heaven is vast (*dào dà tiān dà*), how could it be said to be minute?\nIn its relation to things (*qí zài wù*), how can minuteness be divided?\nIt is called *\"hidden\"* (*yǐn*) because it lacks form (*wú xíng*).\nIt is called *\"profound\"* (*ào*) because it is unfathomable (*wú cè*).\nIndeed, the **Sage’s** heart (*shèngrén zhī xīn*), in harmony with the **Dao/Way**, is subtle.\nWhen it emerges to respond to things (*chū ér yìng wù*), in principle it is hidden (*zài lǐ yǐn*), in practice it is manifest (*zài shì xiǎn*).\nThough the practice is minute, it reveals itself as vast—this is the **Dao/Way** entering the ears and eyes of mortals (*zhù rén zhī ěrmù*).\nThe **Dao/Way** is vast yet dwells in minuteness—this is the profound depths of the heart’s abode (*chǔ xīn zhī yuānměi*).\nMinuteness is the right (*yòu*), the right is the **yin** (*yīn*).\nThrough its hidden nature, the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is subtle yet does not conceal its application (*ér bù cáng yòng*).\nVastness is the left (*zuǒ*), the left is the **prince** (*jūn*).\nThrough its manifest nature, it reveals the practice yet does not display the principle (*ér bù xiǎn lǐ*).\nThus it is said: *\"Subtle yet minute is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\"*\n\nFive praises of the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\nFirst, all **dharma** (*zhūfǎ*) possess subtle essence.\nThe **Mystery** (*Xuán*) scripture observes its subtlety through constant non-desire (*wú yù*), and its profundity through constant desire (*yǒu yù*).\nAgain, the same origin yet different names is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\nThis binds the meaning of the first two sentences, unifying having and none into one principle (*yī zhèng*).\nIt is also said: *\"The **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\"*\nInitially, it refers to direct perception of the **Dao/Way**’s illumination (*jiànjué xiàngzhào*), awakening to this having and none (*wù yǒuwú*), where the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is unified in essence (*yīn shì yǒuwú*), and thus deep insight is attained (*shēn shí zhī*).\nYet the meaning of *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* transcends the former principle (*yòu fēi qián lǐ kě bì*).\nThe scripture’s intent proceeds step by step (*cìdì shì yǒuwú*).\nHaving and none arise from the **Dao/Way** (*yǒuwú shēng yú dào*), and the **Dao/Way** governs having and none (*dào suǒyǐ sī yǒuwú*).\nYet having is inherently having (*yǒu zì yǒu*), not the **Dao/Way**’s having (*fēi dào zhī yǒu*).\nNone is inherently none (*wú zì wú*), not the **Dao/Way**’s none (*fēi dào zhī wú*).\nThis is the **Dao/Way**’s sovereign yet non-sovereign nature (*zhī dào zhǔ zhī ér bù zhǔ*).\nYet none also emerges from the **Dao/Way** (*rán wú yì chū yú dào*), and having also emerges from the **Dao/Way** (*yǒu yì chū yú dào*).\nSince none’s essence is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), having’s essence cannot but also be the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\nNone manifests as images and patterns (*xiàngshù*), and images and patterns return to annihilation and none (*xiàngshù rù wú*).\nThe *Listed Master* (*Lièzǐ*) says: *\"Self-generated, self-transformed\"* is this.\nThus, having and none are not entangled with the **Dao/Way** (*yǒuwú bù gān yú dào*), and it is clear.\nYet having and none both emerge from the **Dao/Way** (*yǒuwú jiē zì dào chū*), and thus each attains the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\nIt is like one father with two sons—father and sons share the same surname (*xìng*).\nHow could the father’s surname be given to the elder son yet not to the younger?\nThis illustrates the **Dao/Way**’s **Mystery** (*Xuán*), and having and none cannot but share the same **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\n\nWhen applied in humanity (*qí yòng zài rén*), the **Dao/Way** generates from **Oneness** (*yī*).\n**Oneness** is number (*shù*), the beginning (*shǐ*), and the meaning of *\"embracing the beginning as one\"* (*bàoshǐ yī*) returns to the **Great None** (*Tàiwú*).\nThen, the body’s use and practice (*shēnzhōng yòngshì*) are revealed.\nHow could it be merely carried by empty words (*qǐ zhí yǐ xūyán zàizhī*)?\nWhen the **Dragon** (*lóng*) and **Tiger** (*hǔ*) intermingle, the **Sage’s embryo** (*shèngtāi*) is formed.\nThe **Sage’s embryo** is refined and reveals the **True Person** (*zhēnrén*).\nThe **True Person** emerges and rides upon the **Divine Light** (*shén guāng*).\n**Zhuangzi** says: *\"Ascending upon the **Divine Light** (*shén guāng*) with form’s annihilation.\"*\n\nSecond, the subtlety precedes all **dharma** (*zhūfǎ*).\nAgain, the **Mystery** (*Xuán*): all **dharma** arise from the **Dao/Way** (*cóng dào ér shēng*).\nThe coarse and refined—each possesses the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)’s principle (*yīyī jiē yǒu Xuánlǐ*), called *\"the essence of the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* (*tǐ Xuán*).\nThe **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of essence has not yet escaped traces (*wú tuō yú jì*).\nTo transcend the essence’s **Mystery** (*Xuán*), to depart from the essence’s application (*zhuàngxíng ér shàng*), and to ascend beyond form (*chéng shén guāng*), this is *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* (*shì yòu Xuán*).\nThe *Sutra of Strict Adherence* (*Léngyán*) says: *\"Subtle yet constant is tranquil, having and none are both none, none and none are also annihilated.\"*\nThis speaks of **nature** (*xìng*).\nEarlier, it was said that the scripture proceeds step by step (*cìdì*).\n*\"Step by step\"* refers to distinguishing **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*), and **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*) refer to dividing **Great Vehicle** (*dàchéng*) and **Small Vehicle** (*xiǎochéng*).\nThe **Great Vehicle** (*dàchéng*) and **Small Vehicle** (*xiǎochéng*) are arranged in stages of fruition (*jiēguǒ*).\nAs in the *Ocean of the Void and Wisdom Storehouse* (*Hǎikōng Zhìcáng*) discourse on having and none (*yǒuwú zhī yì*), the **ultimate subtlety** (*miàoyǒu*) and **ultimate none** (*miàowú*) are the consummation (*jiūjìng*).\nAs in the **Nature School** (*Xìngzōng*) discourse on **inner void** (*nèikōng*), **outer void** (*wàikōng*), **inner-outer void** (*nèiwài kōng*), **void of void** (*kōngkōng*), **great void** (*dàkōng*), **ultimate void** (*shèngyì kōng*), **void of conditioned dharma** (*yǒuwú kōng*), **void of unconditioned dharma** (*wúwéi kōng*), **ultimate void** (*jìngyì kōng*), **void without bounds** (*wújì kōng*), **scattered void** (*sǎnkōng*), **void without change** (*wúbiàn yì kōng*), **void of inherent nature** (*běnxìng kōng*), **void of self-nature** (*zìxiàng kōng*), **void of shared nature** (*gòngxìng kōng*), **void of all dharma** (*yīqiè fǎ kōng*), **void of attainability** (*bùkědé kōng*), **void of inherent nature and self-nature** (*wúxìng zìxìng kōng*), the principle has not yet reached its limit (*lǐ yóu wèi jí*).\nOnly *\"void of attainability\"* (*bùkědé kōng*) is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\n\nThe term *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* sighs at the **Dao/Way**’s profound and distant nature (*dào zhī shēnyuǎn*).\nNo extremes are established (*èrbiān bù lì*), nor is the middle **Dao/Way** (*zhōngdào*) secured.\nSpeech and silence are inexhaustible (*yánmò fěi qióng*), yet it is called *\"the actual\"** (*shìshí*).\nThus, one does not tread upon emptiness (*bù shǐ bù jiè xū*), and this is the true **Oneness** (*zhēnyī*).\nThis is the attainment of having (*suǒwéi yǒudé*), the so-called *\"profound subtlety\"* (*wēimiào*).\n\nNow, we divide the gates of **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*), the stages of the three **Vehicles** (*sānchéng*), to verify the meaning of *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"*.\n\nBefore the **Mixed Primordial** (*Hùnyuán*), there was no name nor image (*wú míng wú xiàng*).\nOnce the **Mixed Primordial** (*Hùnyuán*) is distinguished (*bìpàn*), there are images and names (*yǒu xiàng yǔ míng*).\nFrom the time before namelessness (*zì wú míng yǐqián*), direct insight into its principle (*zhí wù qí lǐ*) is called **sudden** (*dùn*).\nIf from the time after having names (*cóng yǒu míng zhī hòu*), to subdue having and return to none (*shè yǒu guī wú*), this is called **gradual** (*jiàn*).\n**Sudden** (*dùn*) does not establish a single **dharma** (*bù lì yī fǎ*), while **gradual** (*jiàn*) begins with cultivation and practice (*shǐ yú xiūwéi*).\nThe gate of cultivation and practice (*xiūwéi zhī mén*) is inherently attained through teaching (*zì yánjiào dé*).\nThis is the so-called *\"daily progress\"* (*rìyì*).\nProgress yet capable of decline (*yì ér néng sǔn*), until *\"again decline\"* (*yòu sǔn*), one attains *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* (*zhèng yòu Xuán*).\nIn **nature** (*xìng*) it is so, and in **command** (*mìng*) it is also so.\nThe **Canon of Vitality and Health** (*Wèishēng zhī jīng*) begins with nurturing life (*yǎngshēng*), proceeds to prolonged life (*chángshēng*), and culminates in ascension to immortality (*fēixiān*).\nThe principle of **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*) each has its own tendency (*yǒu yóu qù*).\nThe meaning of *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* is not the ultimate scope of the **middle** (*zhōng*) and **small** (*xiǎo*) **Vehicles** (*chéng*).\n\nThe **Supreme Lord of the Dao** (*Tàishàng Dàojūn*) says:\n*\"Neither void nor non-void, nor void of void,\nNeither **dharma** nor non-**dharma**, nor neither **dharma** nor non-**dharma**,\nNeither thing nor non-thing, nor neither thing nor non-thing,\nNeither person nor non-person, nor neither person nor non-person,\nNeither cause nor non-cause, nor neither cause nor non-cause,\nNeither fruit nor non-fruit, nor neither fruit nor non-fruit,\nNeither beginning nor non-beginning, nor neither beginning nor non-beginning,\nNeither end nor non-end, nor neither end nor non-end,\nNeither end nor non-end, nor neither end nor non-end,\nYet as the root and foundation of all **dharma** (*yīqiè zhūfǎ gēnběn*).\nWithout contrivance nor action (*wú zào wú zuò*), it is called **natural** (*zìrán*).\"*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** unfolds naturally, yet cannot be compelled to act nor prevented from acting.\nAgain it is said: The **Dao/Way** referred to as *playen* (玄), when rooted in the boundless four directions, exhausts the meaning of *playen*.\n\nFrom this, the practitioner, neither clinging to void nor to existence, is called *playen*.\nYet this *playen* transcends all attainment, thus it is named **Double-Playen** (*Chóng Playen*), the gateway to all marvels.\nNow we establish the **Sudden Teaching** (*Dùn Jiào*), naming it **Yet-Playen** (*Yòu Playen*), its meaning radiant.\n\nAgain, speaking of the **Great Vehicle** (*Dà Playen*) and the **Supreme Vehicle** (*Wúshàng Playen*), the **Teaching of Jade Purity** (*Yùqīng Jiào*) is the **Great Vehicle**, while the **Supreme Vehicle** is the **extinction of traces** (*Mǐn jì*) in the Three Purity Ones (*Sānqīng*).\nEven as the **Supreme Lord of the Dao** (*Tàishàng Dàojūn*) in the **Nine Grades of Great Purity** (*Tàiqīng Jiǔpǐn*), one enters the realm of *playen*.\nThe **Nine Grades of Great Truth** (*Shàngzhēn Jiǔpǐn*), one attains the utmost *playen*.\nThe **Nine Grades of Great Sagehood** (*Shàngshèng Jiǔpǐn*), one reaches **Yet-Playen**.\nWhen the Three Purity Ones are all extinguished, there is boundless **Yet-Playen** (*Wúliàng yòu Playen*).\n\nAll this is revealed through **nature** (*xìng*) and illuminated by the **Dao/Way** (*dào*), the grand essence of the scriptures resides here.\nThus, it is called the **Round Teaching** (*Yuán Jiào*), encompassing **nature** and **life** (*xìngmìng*).\n\nWhen **virtue/power** (*dé*) enters, it becomes the **Dao/Way** (*dào*); when **nature** (*xìng*) merges, it becomes **life** (*mìng*).\nThis **life** (*mìng*), the culmination of **nature** (*xìng*), differs from the **life** of longevity (*chángshēng*).\n\nThe **life** of nurturing vitality (*yǎngshēng*) is not merely the fulfillment of **nature** (*xìng*), but also requires the preservation of deep roots and firm foundations.\n\nAgain, following the **Longevity School** (*Chángshēng zōng*), the **Yet-Playen** of the **Double-Playen** (*Chóng Playen*) is divided into two gates.\n*Playen* is the inherent principle of all ten thousand things, manifesting in form and perception, revealing marvels in action, and transcending marvels to commune with the divine—all these are called *playen*.\n*Playen* is ever concealed.\nWith concealment as **mystery** (*mì*), and **mystery** not transmitted, thus the **Forbidden Texts of the Flower Hall** (*Huā Táng nèijìn zhī shū*) are sealed, and their penetration lies in **entry** (*rù*).\n\nThose who can penetrate are called **Seeing the Mechanism** (*jiàn jī*).\nThe *Yì* says: *\"Delve into the profound and explore the hidden, hook the depths and reach the distant.\"* (*tàn zé shì suǒ yǐn, gōu shēn zhì yuǎn*)\n\nYet the hidden *playen* of things cannot compare to the hidden *playen* of the human body.\nThe hidden *playen* of the human body is the **Heavenly Mechanism** (*Tiānjī*).\n\n**Laozi** says: *\"The human body is subtle and marvelous, the worldly cannot speak of it.\"* (*rén shēn wēimiào, fán shì nán yán*)\nMeaning all people value the distant and despise the near, unaware of the *playen* within their own bodies, yet only seeking to exhaust the mysteries of external things.\n\nThe *playen* within the body—sages discern the subtleties of yin and yang, and thus establish the **Law-Image of Heaven and Earth** (*fǎ xiàng guànkūn*), forming the **Nine Elixir Secrets** (*Jiǔdān zhī jué*), the **Longevity Doctrine** (*Chángshēng zhī zōng*).\nThey say the **Dao/Way**’s essence lies in the profound and subtle, the **Heavenly Mechanism** is deep and distant, and only the most profound cannot speak of it.\n\nThis method originates from the **Three Sovereigns** (*Sān Huáng*), and is transmitted to **Yellow Emperor** (*Huángdì*).\nLater, those who succeeded the sages were many, yet their recorded teachings are sparse.\nOnly **Wei Boyang** (*Wèi Bóyáng*) composed the *Parameters of the Triple Concord* (*Shēntóng Qì*), correctly taking the **hexagrams and trigrams** (*yáo xiàng*) and **systematic words** (*xì yán*) of the *Zhou Yì* (周易), harmonizing them with the **Six Celestial Children** (*Liù Tiānzǐ*), moving the **Heavenly Mechanism** of Earth and Heaven, and unfolding its profound mysteries.\nHis words say: *\"To refine the **Golden Elixir** (*Jīnyè*) and **Great Elixir** (*Tàidān*), one must first seek the **mixed origins** (*hùnyuán*) of Heaven and Earth, investigate the **foundations of yin and yang transformation** (*yīnyáng zàohuà zhī běn*), understand that **water and fire** (*shuǐhuǒ*) **subdue and restore** (*kèfù*) each other as husband and wife, and recognize that **metal and water** (*jīnshuǐ*) **emerge and nourish** (*xiàngshēng*) each other as child and mother.\nThus, when the male contains the female form, **lead** (*qiān*) within produces **sand** (*shā*).\nWhen the female merges with the male form, **sand** (*shā*) within produces **mercury** (*gǒng*).\"*\n\nThe Sun is **yang**. Within the Sun lies the **crow**—**yin** containing **yang**. The Moon is **yin**. Within the Moon lies the **rabbit**—**yang** containing **yin**. Thus, there exists the **Dao/Way** of **yin** and **yang** reversing, the principle of **water** and **fire** requiring each other. The **Dao/Way** of **creation and transformation** is now clear.\n\nHaving known their positions, one must also know their **roots**—these are the **mixed origins** (*hùnyuán*) of Heaven and Earth. Having taken their **roots**, one must also take their **symbols**—these are the **paired symbols** of **yin** and **yang**. Having obtained their **symbols**, one must inquire into **movement and stillness**; when **movement and stillness** are clear, one must know their **numbers**; having known their **numbers**, one must follow the **water clock**; when the **water clock** is divided, one must clarify **advance and retreat**; when **advance and retreat** are clear, one must then **separate the Dragon and Tiger**.\n\nThen the boundaries of **south and north** are divided, and the forms of **metal and water** are united. Thus, the **Great Elixir** (*Dàdān*) may be refined.\n\nThere are also **internal and external methods and symbols**: **water** and **fire** have **dryness and moisture**; there are **cauldrons and chambers**; there are **fetal sacs**; there are **advance and retreat**; there are **hexagram symbols**; there are **omens of water and fire**; there are **rules for extraction and addition**; there are **patterns of the trigrams**; there are **forms of separation and union**. As mentioned above, each contains hidden profundity and mystery.\n\nOne must exhaust one’s wisdom and still seek instruction from a teacher. If one claims that the **mysterious pass** is a secret and leaves it unsaid, then where is the **doctrine of longevity**?\n\nPreviously, it was said: *\"The **nameless** is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the **named** is the mother of ten thousand things.\"* Speaking of **beginning** and **mother**, yet not speaking of **end**, one must infer the intent—this is called **grasping it**.\n\nAs for the **completion of the method** and the **principle of threefold perfection**, the **golden edicts and jade inscriptions** are recorded, the **Dao/Way** is transmitted, and the **doctrine of the Five Immortals** is elucidated. The **essentials of nine returns and seven transformations** are distinguished—this is the gathering of the **most profound mysteries**.\n\nAs for those of **minor attainment**, they are **initial profundity**; those of **medium attainment** are **ultimate profundity**; those of **great attainment** are **profoundest profundity**. This is seen in **cultivating the body and nurturing life**, **ingesting qi** and **refining the elixir**, ultimately achieving **transcendence and ascension**, ascending to the **ultimate profundity**—all of this has stages.\n\nLike their **nature**, from **empty delusion** to **true emptiness**; like their **life**, from **cultivated vitality** to **ascending to the True**—profound beyond profundity, its meaning is thus.\n\nTo **be able to be without** is not yet to **be able to be without without**; thus, one cannot yet be the **gate of all mysteries**. To **be able to nurture qi** is not yet to **be able to refine the spirit**; thus, one cannot yet grasp the **logic of profoundest profundity**. **Nature exists in emptiness**, **life exists in reality**—only then does the **gate of mysteries** appear, not inherently mysterious, but **mysterious in multitude**.\n\nThe **Six Canons** symbolize **virtue**. The **gate of all mysteries**—as the *Explanation of Characters* says—**three persons** constitute a **multitude**; this is not limited to three. From **Heaven and Earth** to **all things**, from **sentient beings** to **insentient things**, all are encompassed by it. Thus, it is called the **gate of all mysteries**.\n\nTruly reaching **profundity** is **exhausting one’s nature**; exhausting one’s nature is **oneness alone**. **Profoundest profundity** is **ultimate life**. Ultimate life enters **neither death nor birth**; thus, the **Dao/Way** has **no gate, no side paths**—it is the **vast and boundless sovereign**.\n\nIf one speaks of it as a **gate**, then the **Dao/Way** indeed has a **location**—this is incorrect. Speaking of it as a **gate** means it is not in any **location**; speaking of it as the **Dao/Way**, **nature has a returning movement**. Because of this returning movement, it is spoken of in terms of **entering and exiting**; yet speaking of **entering and exiting**, one has not yet seen **perfected nature**. When **nature is perfected**, there is nothing to perfect. Who exits? Who enters? Only then can one **gather all things** in the **ultimate void**, making the **mysterious oneness** an **unfathomable spirit**.\n\nThe *Classic of Change* says: *\"Perfected nature, abiding, abiding—this is the gate of Dao/Way and virtue.\"* Thus, **birth and death**, as the *Secret of the Dark* says, **\"Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life\"**—this is the **principle of the Dao/Way**. **Exiting mechanisms, entering mechanisms**—as the **Gèn** trigram says, **\"When the time to stop arrives, stop; when the time to move arrives, move.\"**\n\nThose who **exit without fear** have **embodied the Dao/Way**; those who **enter without delight** have **penetrated profundity**; and those who **exit and enter without knowing why they exit and enter** have **exhausted the mysteries**. Thus, knowing the **gate** means **penetrating the principles of life and death for all things**, revealing the **doctrine of the return of all things**, and indeed, all things **receive their mandate from the **nameless**—this is **emerging from the **nameless** to the **named****.\n\nThose who receive their mandate from the **Dao/Way** are all **mysterious**; thus, it is called **all mysteries**. How mysterious is it? Like **water**—those who **transgress** are **drowned**; all who are **born from the Dao/Way** possess **mystery**.\n\nNext, it is said: *\"I emerge from the **gate of all mysteries** and obtain **oneness**; **oneness** is within me. I shall carry this mystery and return, restoring my **root** and **command**, embodying **profoundest profundity**, and also being able to **master all mysteries**.\"* Like **fire**—**illuminating from myself**, all things are illuminated; **transforming from myself**, all things are transformed. Initially, the **Dao/Way’s mystery** is **me**; ultimately, **I** am also the **mystery of all things**. When one reaches this point, does the **Dao/Way** truly **mystify me**, or do **I** truly **mystify all things**? Ultimately, it advances to **unknowing**.\n\nShào Ruòyú says: *\"The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is the **gate of all mysteries**.\"* The **Great Dao/Way** is **utter void and utter stillness**, **formless and nameless**; it cannot be sought through **sight or hearing**, cannot be known through **thought or reasoning**, cannot be attained through **speech or language**. This is the **Dao/Way** of **no beginning and no end**, **constantly existing and unchanging**. From **primordial void**, it **transforms into one qi**; because there is a **trace of one qi**, it is thus **speakable**.\n\nSince it is said to be **speakable**, it is not the **constantly existing Dao/Way**; since there is a **name of qi**, it is not the **constantly existing name**. Before **one qi** manifested, in the **formless and nameless** time, this was the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**. This is the **Dao/Way** that cannot be spoken of. When there is the **name of one qi**, it is the **mother of ten thousand things**—this is the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of.\n\nThus, one knows that **my body** emerges from **oneness**, and **human ability** can take **oneness** as **law**. Upon **awakening and entering**, one sees the **Great Dao/Way**. The **Great Dao/Way** is **human true heart**; **one qi** is the **desire born from the heart**.\n\nThe true heart is originally empty and tranquil, without birth or annihilation. When the true heart moves, it becomes manifest, and its names are desire-thought, wisdom, intuition, and cognition. Because the heart gives rise to desire, one follows desire and receives birth. After birth, one accepts and rejects pleasures and evils, clings endlessly to the five colors and five sounds, relies on strength and arrogance to dwell in honor or humiliation, and is deluded by false thoughts. Clinging to this false heart, one covers the true heart, failing to comprehend the Dao/Way of **one qi**.\n\nIf one abandons falsehood and desire, then one attains **oneness**. This heart, when held, is upright; when obtained, it is luminous. As the mother of ten thousand things, it is also the root of birth and death. Desire covers the true heart, hence there is birth and death.\n\nIf one can be without desire, then being without desire is empty and tranquil, returning to the formless beginning. Thus, one can transcend birth and death.\n\nHence, Laozi says: *\"Constantly without desire, one observes the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\"* This is the subtle mystery of transcending birth and death. Again, he says: *\"Constantly with desire, one observes the Dao/Way of one qi.\"* This is the perilous edge.\n\nShallow understanding cannot seek the heart with the heart—this is having desire. It cannot annihilate the heart with the heart—this is being without desire. These two—having and not having—are both encompassed as one principle. When spoken of as teaching, they are distinguished by the names \"having\" and \"not having.\"\n\nWhen having and not having merge, it is called **Xuan** (the Mysterious). The Buddhist School calls it the **\"Non-dual Dharma Gate\"** or the **\"Middle Way.\"** The gate of **Xuan** takes the Middle as its law, like a net analogy. Yet since the law arises from the heart, and once it arises in the heart, it clings to the Middle—this is not empty and tranquil.\n\nLaozi feared the Middle Way’s law would bind, preventing one from abandoning the net. Thus, he further explained with **Xuan**, teaching that the student should neither cling to having or not having nor dwell in the Middle Way of **Xuan**. In actual practice, the ground of reality is untouched by even a speck of dust, and the heart becomes empty and tranquil—this is **wuwei** (non-action), so no need for contemplation.\n\nBecause there is no attainment, this is being without desire. Hence, no dust arises, and it is called **clearing and tranquility**; there is no action, so it is called **wuwei**; there is no cultivation or realization, so it is called **natural**; there is nothing at all, so it is called **empty and tranquil**; it is unrestrained and free, so it is called **soaring**; it is uniformly ordinary, so it is called **serene and simple**.\n\nThus, when the heart is without desire, it departs from all distinctions. Departing from distinctions, there is no affliction. When the heart is without desire, encountering things there is no self. Without self, there is no conflict, hence no blame.\n\nWhen the heart is without desire, it departs from all good and evil. Departing from good and evil, it is not bound by cause and effect. When the heart is without desire, it does not cling to all things, hence there is no birth, and without birth, there is no death.\n\nThe heart that is constantly without desire is the gate of all mysteries. King Zhi-ran says: *\"The Dao that can be spoken of reaches the gate of all mysteries.\"* The Dao that cannot be spoken of—when spoken of, it is not so. The Dao that cannot be named—when named, it is not so. Calling it the Dao, can it not be spoken of? The Dao that can be spoken of is not the naturally constant Dao. The name that can be named is not the naturally arising name.\n\nThe constantly constant Dao and constantly constant name, like a ring without end, like the four seasons in their course—never beginning, never ending, yet arising and vanishing in turn, decaying and reviving, are not what I call the truly constant.\n\nConstantly without desire, one observes its mystery—this is the substance of the Dao. Constantly with desire, one observes its perilous edge—this is the function of the Dao. Yet substance and function are always concealed in **huanghu** (obscurity and confusion). Between the subtle and coarse, the profound and the obscure, it cannot be known by wisdom, cannot be perceived by cognition, nor can it be attained through sight, hearing, or response.\n\nHow then does one attain it? There are those who learn and know it; there are none who know it without learning.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Without thought, without action, silently unmoving, yet responding and thus communicating with all under Heaven.\"*\n\nYangzi says: *\"Plow the Dao and obtain the Dao; hunt virtue and obtain virtue.\"*\n\nMencius says: *\"Self-obtained.\"*\n\nWhen self-obtained, one encounters the source on all sides. When study reaches the point of encountering the source on all sides, then where does one go without carrying it?\n\nThe so-called \"obtaining\" refers to obtaining this.\n\nAh! The mystery of the Dao suffices to exhaust the nature of all things. The subtlety of the Dao suffices to fathom the principles of all things. Nature and mystery are one in profundity, and the so-called having and not having—can they not be observed together and dualistically extinguished?\n\nSome say: *\"Having having, not having not having—what does this mean?\"* This speaks of how having and not having alternate thus: not having is true having, having is true not having. Having and not having interdependently arise, never differing.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"These two emerge together but have different names. They are called **Xuan** because its color is dark and faint, red and black, yin and yang mingling in steam—all unified.\"*\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"One yin and one yang is called the Dao; the unfathomable yin and yang is called the Spirit.\"* Yin and yang, having and not having, are all unified.\n\nUnified in one, yet not yet mysterious in one; mysterious in one, yet not yet mysterious in multiplicity; mysterious in multiplicity, yet not yet mysterious in self and things. Hence, it is said: *\"Spirit is the mysterious speech of all things.\"*\n\n**Xuan** beyond **Xuan**, then one and multiplicity, self and things—all are mysteriously unified. This is the so-called gate of all mysteries.\n\nThus, Laozi begins his first chapter with the profound meaning of **repeated Xuan**, reaching the most profound and distant principles, which cannot be exceeded. This is what students should devote their hearts to.\n\nProgram Tai-zhi says: *\"The Dao that can be spoken of reaches the unnameable.\"* Without distinctions of self/other, past/future, always thus—this is its constancy. If it can do this but not that, if it was once thus but is not now, then it cannot be called constant.\n\nBefore the Dao becomes virtue, it is indistinct and boundless, encompassing all things in one. Within it, it can be firm or yielding, real or empty, short or long, responding to all stimuli with countless differences, yet not adhering to any particular thing or event—so what can it not respond to, what can it not accomplish?\n\n---\n*(Note: \"重玄\" [chóng xuán] is rendered as \"repeated Xuan\" to preserve the layered profundity, though \"double mystery\" or \"ultimate mystery\" could also serve. \"恍惚\" [huanghu] is \"obscurity and confusion,\" a Daoist term for the ineffable state beyond duality.)*\n\nThe absence of distinctions between self and other, past and future—this is its constancy. Those who grasp the Dao understand its boundless essence and thus speak clearly of its unchanging nature, calling it *constant*.\n\nWhen the Dao manifests as virtue, virtue solidifies into principles—*ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (ritual), *zhi* (wisdom)—all dwelling within the Dao yet unfolding into specific deeds. Once named and defined, they adhere to particular forms and limits. Thus, this virtue cannot encompass other virtues, nor can its name serve as another’s. Therefore, what can be spoken of as the Dao is no longer the *constant Dao*, and what can be named is not the *constant Name*.\n\nThe unnamed is the origin of heaven and earth.\nHeaven and earth—governing all creation, opening and closing, generating and transforming—are already vast within their domain. Yet Laozi further ascends beyond them, establishing another category and naming it *Wu* (the Non-being). He declares that this *Wu* is what can be called the origin of heaven and earth. Such claims, the Confucian scholars doubt as empty boasts.\n\nYet the *Yijing*’s two principles (*yin* and *yang*) are heaven and earth, but what gives rise to them is truly the *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate). The *Taiji* is neither heaven nor earth, yet it encompasses both, standing supreme. At that stage, no forms exist to be cast aside, no numbers to be counted—thus Laozi renames it *Wu*. Though their names differ, their essence is the same. His disciples knew later ages would doubt this, so Zhuangzi framed a question and answered it himself:\n\n*\"If form arises from the formless, how did heaven and earth come to be?\"*\nThus, it is said that *Wu* gives rise to heaven and earth.\nEven Zhuangzi knew people would doubt, so he clarified: Before heaven and earth formed, within the formless there were four stages: *Taiyi* (Great Unity), *Taichu* (Great Commencement), *Taishi* (Great Beginning), *Taosu* (Great Primordial)—this is their order. Though their *qi*, form, and substance were present yet undivided, they could only be called *hunlun* (indistinct chaos).\n\nOnly when movement and transformation occurred did the light and clear rise as heaven, the heavy and turbid settle as earth. Thus, the *Taiji* is precisely that which dwells in emptiness, embracing both purity and turbidity, establishing itself in an unmatched state of non-action. Is this not the indistinct yet formless?\n\nLaozi names it *Wu*, preceding heaven and earth—this aligns with the *Yijing*’s logic.\n\nThe named is the mother of all things.\nA later passage states: *\"All things under heaven arise from the having; having arises from the non-being.\"* When it is *Wu*, it is simply vast and boundless. Yet all things emerge from it, so calling *Wu* the origin of heaven and earth is still plausible. But once it enters *You* (the having), how does it differ from other things, yet still generate them?\n\nIt is the *Wu* that has stirred yet not yet solidified into things. Examining its boundaries, it is the *hunlun*—about to move but not yet manifest. On the verge of being named *Wu*, it already differs from *Wu*; on the verge of being called *wu* (thing), it lacks defined form. Thus, studying its core, it is named *You*.\n\nWhen it fully takes shape and is called *wanwu* (ten thousand things), they are all fixed in form and substance: heaven and earth, sun and moon, rain and dew, mountains and rivers, grasses and trees, humans and beasts, tools and vessels—all clearly defined, not merely *You*.\n\nLaozi describes this *You* in three shifting names, yet they share one essence. Numerically, it is *One*—capable of generating all yet not yet all. Figuratively, it is *Xiang* (image); practically, it is *Pu* (uncarved block). *Xiang* and *Pu* can both become form and vessel, yet their form and vessel remain uncoagulated. Thus, above it is not yet *Wu*, below it is not yet *wu*—this *You* transcends past and future, self and other, as the eternal progenitor of all things. Hence, a later passage declares: *\"All things under heaven have a beginning, which is the mother of all things under heaven.\"* Zhuangzi’s theory of origins stems from this.\n\nLaozi himself knew this truth would be hard to grasp at once, so he further explained, moving from the whole to the particular: *\"There is a thing, indistinctly formed, existing before heaven and earth. Silent and boundless, it stands alone yet never changes, revolves eternally yet leaves no trace—it can be the mother of all things under heaven. I do not know its name; I call it the Dao, forcefully name it the Great.\"*\n\n*Mixing and forming*—this is the undivided state. It is the indistinct unity of *Wu* and *You* before differentiation. Existing before heaven and earth, it is where they truly originate. Standing alone, revolving eternally, it is the mother of all things under heaven—truly without a child, yet the source of all.\n\nThese three aspects encompass the origin of all things and phenomena under heaven. Laozi’s text omits what the *Six Classics* already elaborate, yet delves deeply into what they leave unexplored. The *Six Classics* exhaust the discussion of governance when reaching the Dao, but Laozi ascends beyond the Dao’s mother—heaven and earth—to higher realms: *Wu*, *Xuan*, and *repeated Xuan*—these are its domains.\n\nYet once the distinctions lie beyond these three aspects, they become beyond what can be spoken of as the Dao or named at all.\n\nSince there is no name to invoke, yet one must speak from this realm to awaken the unenlightened—where then shall words be anchored?\n\nThus, transcending what can be spoken of or named, he establishes the dual categories of *You* and *Wu*, to convey his intent.\n\nThis is the overarching principle of his teaching.\n\nOnce these two categories are named, the scope of his discourse becomes accessible to all, allowing each to follow and infer its meaning.\n\nWhen speaking of *Wu*, one knows his intent must lie before heaven and earth.\nWhen speaking of *You*, one knows his intent must lie beyond all things.\n\nThus, though his text meanders in intricate ways, its myriad passages never stray from the dual principles of *You* and *Wu*.\n\nYet *You* and *Wu* were already discussed in the *Six Classics*, differing only in that the *Six Classics* never spoke of them in isolation.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s references to \"without thought, without action, without form, without substance\" indeed speak of *Wu*, yet thought, action, form, and substance are merely adjuncts—never wholly abandoned to stand alone as *Wu*.\n\nLaozi’s innovation here lies in addressing the moment before creation had any manifestation, where even thought, action, form, and substance had not yet taken shape.\n\nHis intent, it seems, is to position himself within *Wu*, placing the *Six Classics* in the realm of already-formed things.\n\nHis aspirations are indeed lofty and distant, yet his words imply what may not exist.\n\nYet his distinctions are clear, his principles consistent throughout, and all may be examined and verified.\n\nConfucian scholars also draw from this lineage, though many misinterpret his text by conflating *Dao* and *qi*, forcing shallow reasoning into profound mysteries—thus distorting and confusing it.\n\nWhy not test his teachings with concrete examples? Zhang Liang’s tranquility, Cao Parameter’s serenity, and Emperor Wen’s silent governance—these are instances where Laozi’s teachings, though not fully implemented in the Zhou, bore fruit in the Han.\n\nIn applying Laozi’s principles, they stand as the foremost models across the ages.\n\nYet did these rulers ever truly withdraw from worldly affairs? They simply refused to burden themselves with personal desires, so their reverence for *Wu*’s power—though not fully realizing the Dao—sufficed to cultivate emptiness and still chaos, never entangling themselves in worldly matters.\n\nBy the time of the Western Jin, however, rituals, music, laws, and governance were abandoned in favor of absolute *Wu*, leaving no structure or order, and the Jin dynasty collapsed in chaos. Thus, those who study Laozi must recognize that within *wuwei* lies *wu buwei*—what is not done—and only then can they understand how Han and Jin governance, though rooted in the same source, produced such divergent outcomes.\n\nAs for those who falsely claim *wuwei* as their practice, naming themselves Daoists while fabricating absurd tales of transcendence, fortune, and misfortune, these are not Laozi’s words.\n\nTracing their origins, tales of immortality arose in the Warring States, while prayers for retribution and responses flourished in the Han—yet none of this appears in the *Eighty-One Chapters*.\n\nShould students of Laozi adhere to the original eighty-one chapters, or to the later embellishments of fantastical speech?\n\nShould rulers and ministers emulate Zhang Liang, Cao Parameter, and Emperor Wen, or the reckless excesses of the Jin and the bizarre later traditions?\n\nThese are clear lessons—easy to discern, yet essential to heed.\n\nEver without desire, one may observe its boundaries.\n\nThe capacity to generate the **Having** from the **Non-Having**, yet not claiming itself as the **Having**, is how one may perpetually abide in the **Non-Having**.\n\nThe capacity to generate **Things** from the **Having**, yet not claiming itself as **Things**, is how one may perpetually abide in the **Having**.\n\nHow so? Before form and substance take root, within there is no separation or interruption, hence it may be perpetuated. But when one derives form and substance from **Creation-Transformation** (造化), and emerges from the **Dao/Way** to manifest as **virtue/power** (德), **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **propriety**, and **ritual**, these are all **Things**.\n\nWhen these **Things** are perpetually congealed without dispersion, they may be named. If the **Having** is dispersed, then there is **Non-Having**. Thus, once the **Having** has become **Things**, all that has ever taken form cannot master its own **Having**.\n\nWhen myriad **Things** arise together in their **keynote** (芸芸) state, and those that return to their root and wither become **bare** (枯秃), they may be awaited. For those who already possess the **Having**, since it cannot be retained, they revert to **command** (复命), and when the **stillness** (静) of the **Non-Having** once more overflows like spring’s nourishment, all that emerges in **keynote** cannot restrain itself, and thus retreats into the **Non-Having**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way’s** attainment or loss, along with the **spokes-and-hub** (辐毂) and **door-and-window** (户牖) of its implements—all are governed by a single principle. Thus, the **Having** and **Non-Having** of the world are insufficient to trace the **outer and inner** (表里) of the **Great Dao/Way**.\n\nThose who perpetually abide in **Non-Having** are the **Dao/Way’s** essence yet to emerge. Those who perpetually abide in the **Having** are the **Dao/Way’s** movement already tending toward emergence.\n\nThese are all **Things** yet not ensnared by **Things**, hence they may encompass all **Creation-Transformation** without being consumed by it. With their dwelling in totality and their substance embracing all, the beginning and end of the **Great Dao/Way** may be sought within them.\n\nThat which is called **Mysterious** (妙) dwells in the depths of **Creation-Transformation**, where all **Having** originates. This is the **Non-Having** yet to be encompassed by totality.\n\nThat which is called **Boundary** (徼) is the **edge**, like the four corners of a frontier marking the boundaries of a central kingdom. It is the **Non-Having** that has emerged as **Having**, yet has not yet fully become **Things**. Hence it cannot be called **Mysterious** and is perpetually the **Boundary**.\n\nWith these two distinctions established, the **outer and inner** (表里) of the **Dao/Way** may be measured. To attain **Non-Having** and dwell within it is to explore the origin of all **Having** and perceive its **inner**; to attain the **Having** and dwell within it is to exhaust the production of all **Things** and perceive their **outer**.\n\nThus, Laozi esteems the perpetuation of **Non-Having** and **Having**, for within them the **outer and inner** of the **Dao/Way** may be imagined.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Those who perceive the **Having** are the virtuous gentlemen of old; those who perceive the **Non-Having** are the friends of Heaven and Earth.\"* This aligns with the principle.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* (《易》) states: *\"That which is above form is called the **Dao/Way**; that which is below form is called the **instrument** (器).\"* The **Dao/Way** is the **instrument**, and the **instrument** is the **Dao/Way**. It is merely that their forms are above or below, not that they are two distinct entities.\n\nThis **Mysterious** and **Boundary** are the *Book of Changes*’s **above** and **below**. Those who abandon the **above** and **below** yet name it **Mysterious** and **Boundary** seek only to establish their own school, though their ultimate intent is not fundamentally different.\n\nIn the world, how could there be anything below that lacks support and yet stands empty above? Or anything **inner** without its **outer**?\n\nThis is the mutual reliance of **Dao/Way** and **instrument**, **Having** and **Non-Having**, clearly evident and easily understood. Hence, they are borrowed to illustrate that within the discourse on **Mysterious**, **Boundary** is never neglected.\n\nThese two are of the same origin yet bear different names. The **Having** is **Boundary** to the **Non-Having**, while the **Non-Having** is **Mysterious** to the **Having**. When they have already emerged, the **Having** and **Non-Having** may indeed be divided. But before emergence, they are indistinguishably merged, hence it is said they are the same.\n\nThe same is **One**. **One** is not yet **One**, for from it the **Three** may generate the **Myriad**, yet it has not yet reached the **Myriad**.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* and the Five Classics, as well as the *Discourses* (《论》) and *Mencius* (《孟》), have all spoken of **One**, yet none have explained how it is **One**.\n\nLaozi’s disciples, however, have elaborately expounded upon this. They speak of **\"indistinct unity\"** (混成), **\"indistinctly merged\"** (浑沦), and **\"indistinct chaos\"** (浑沌)—all describing its undivided state.\n\nFrom its emergence before division, it is named **\"same\"** (同); from its **Non-Having** and **matching\"** (匹) not yet being so, it is named **\"alone\"** (独); and from its **Non-Having** not being otherwise, it is named **\"perpetual\"** (常). All these terms emphasize its totality and clarify its essence.\n\nWhen the **Non-Having** has emerged as **Having** yet not fully become **Things**, it is again given distinctions—named **\"One\"** (一), **\"Uncarved\"** (朴), or **\"Form\"** (象)—all taken from its capacity to encompass the **Myriad** in unity, for the names arise from what it contains.\n\nThus, Laozi’s discourse on the **Dao/Way** is particularly detailed here. Though its branches and leaves may greatly diverge from Confucian teachings, even Confucians cannot help but draw upon its **Mysterious** insights.\n\nHence, the profound in **Dao/Way** can still align the disparate to serve the unified; while the shallow in **Dao/Way**, to the point of declaring that Confucius does not belong to a single school, are like those who pass through a doorway yet fail to recognize the halls and chambers within.\n\nThe unified is called **Dark** (玄). Five colors find **black** as their **Dark**, Heaven’s color is **Dark** in its boundless expanse, the **Great Dark** (太玄) of the **Vague** (罔) is direct, and in winter, all **Things** return to their root, **revert to command** (复命), without visible boundaries—this is named **Dark**.\n\nThus, **Dark** refers to the **profound and distant**. The *Liezi*’s statement that *\"the **Dao/Way** is formless and ends in the **Dark**\"* is precisely this teaching.\n\nThe unified is called **Dark**, for **Having** and **Non-Having** merge, indistinctly merged without separation, hence it may be called **profound and distant**.\n\nIf their traces are faintly discernible, then the **Non-Having** is truly hidden within the **Non-Having**, while the **Having** is truly formed within the **Having**. Once distinctions begin to emerge, it cannot again be called **Dark**.\n\nThe **Dark** beyond **Dark**, is the gateway to myriad **Mysterious** insights. When all **Having** is indistinctly merged into **Non-Having**, it has reached its extreme.\n\nNow, advancing further upward, there is yet another **Dark**. The **Non-Having** advancing into **Dark** becomes ever more profound. And beyond the **Dark**, there is yet another **Dark**, its principle being what?\n\nZhuangzi and Liezi have indeed illuminated this.\n\n「In Liezi’s discourse, there are **Too-Easy** (*Tà Yì*), **Too-Primordial** (*Tà Chū*), **Too-Beginning** (*Tà Shǐ*), and **Too-Substantial** (*Tà Sù*), all of which are the **Qi** (*Qi*) and form’s foundation for the myriad.\n\nWhen descending through these four stages in sequence, and reaching the **Light and Pure** Heaven (*Qīng Qīng zhī Tiān*) and the **Heavy and Impure** Earth (*Zhòng Zhuó zhī Dì*), one may observe their order: **Having** advances to **Non-Having**, **Non-Having** further advances to **Dark**, and **Dark** advances yet again to **Darkness**—their successive ranks are clearly discernible.\n\nLiezi says: *“There is **Having**, and there is **Non-Having**,”*—this aligns with Laozi’s **constant Non-constant Having** (*Cháng Wúcháng Yǒu*).\n\nAgain, *“There is **Having** before **Having** and **Non-Having**,”*—this is Laozi’s **Dark**.\n\nAgain, *“There is **Having** before **Having** and **Non-Having**, before **Having** and **Non-Having**,”*—this is the **Dark** beyond **Dark**.\n\nAll are insights perceived by the mind yet unnamed by the world, expressed through thought and forced into speech.\n\nLaozi’s words—**“stillness, emptiness, profound and distant”** (*Jìliáo Yǎomiǎo*)—truly describe the state of **Dark** and **Dark** beyond **Dark**, while Zhuangzi further expands them as **“dim and silent, murky and obscure”** (*Hūn Mò Qí Jīn*).\n\nOnly **constant Non-Having** (*Cháng Wú*), which can encompass the **Mysterious** essence of all **Having**, is the true source from which the **Dark** beyond **Dark** emerges.\n\nIn later chapters, the **multitude of myriad** (*Zhòng Fǔ*) and **Zhuangzi’s hundred transformations** (*Bǎi Chāng*), along with the myriad beauties, all follow this same **Mysterious** principle, yet are clarified in their own terms.\n\nSince the advent of written records, the **Dao/Way** of sages’ wisdom, virtue, and righteousness has been revealed in the *Yì* and confirmed by the governance of the **Five Three** (*Wǔ Sān*)—the **Six Classics**. From ancient times to the present, the world relies on them for sustenance, like the **Five Grains** and **Cloth of Raw Silk** (*Bùmáo*), without which life cannot thrive, and with which it flourishes. None can replace them, nor is there another principle as profound.\n\nYet Laozi establishes a teaching that seeks to utterly abandon sages’ wisdom, virtue, and righteousness, and revert to the **beginning of knotted cords** (*Jiégǒu*).\n\nThose who take the **Six Classics** as their profession collectively uphold and reject this teaching, even labeling his work as a **heretical doctrine**. Yet the **Ten Thousand Words** (*Wàn Yī Yán*) persist alongside the **Six Classics**, never truly discarded—why is this?\n\nThe **Six Classics** elucidate **rites and laws**, so their texts are all about **instruments** (*Qì*). Yet regarding the **Dao/Way**, they offer only a brief outline.\n\nLaozi exhausts the **Dao/Way** in its **constant Non-Having** (*Cháng Wú*), yet omits mention of **instruments** (*Qì*).\n\nThough their focus differs—one detailed, the other sparse—**instruments** (*Qì*) bear the **Dao/Way**, and the **Dao/Way** generates **instruments** (*Qì*). They cannot be separated into two distinct paths.\n\nSeeking the **Dao/Way**, one must ascend from lower learning to higher attainment, yet the **Six Classics** do not fully explore its depths.\n\nLaozi, however, has fully expounded its profound essence.\n\nThus, those who study the **Dao/Way** and glimpse its truth find no language in the **Six Classics** to verify it, and so they align with Laozi’s words to elucidate its **virtue/power** (*Dé*).\n\nHence, though his teaching appears contradictory to theirs, the **Dao/Way** remains concurrent—there is good reason for this.\n\nAh! This principle is subtle indeed, too profound to be grasped in a single utterance.\n\nNow, let me take the most accessible yet closest examples from ancient times to clarify it, so all may understand.\n\n**Agriculture** is the foundation of civilization, yet its practice is the most coarse.\n\nThe teachings of the **Six Classics** speak of the timing for plowing, sowing, harvesting, and storing—of the tools before the **plow** (*Sì*), **hoe** (*Chuán*), **weeder** (*Zhì*), and **reaper** (*Zhì*). These are the most **concrete** (*Xíng*) and **lowly** (*Yuè*) of all **instruments** (*Qì*).\n\nYet the transformations of the four seasons depend on these **instruments** for their manifestation, and the seeds of a hundred grains achieve their fullness through them.\n\nEven if the **original Qi** of Heaven and Earth is beyond naming, it still relies on these **instruments** to manifest its functions—how can one claim the **Dao/Way** is absent simply because its tools are present?\n\nAs for Laozi’s **Dao/Way**, he exhausts its utmost **Mysterious** essence.\n\nHe rejects the governance of **eastern labor and western harvest** (*Dōng Zuò Xī Chéng*), yet even in his texts, though he speaks of all things arising and returning to their roots—too numerous to enumerate—he still provides tools for **planting** (*Zhòng*), **harvesting** (*Shuō*), **nurturing** (*Yǎng*), and **pruning** (*Fá*).\n\nYet Laozi never utters a word on these matters.\n\nWhen discussing the **subtle** and **Mysterious**, he still considers the **hinge of Heaven and Earth’s transformations** (*Tiān Dì Shēnghuà zhī Shuā*) and the **beginning of virtue and Dao** (*Dé Dào Yǔncáng zhī Shǐ*) as shallow, directly probing the origins of Heaven and Earth—**“how did Heaven and Earth come to be Heaven and Earth?”**—and the **Dark Non-Having**—**“how could the **Dark Non-Having** be **Dark Non-Having**?”**—only to name them in accordance with his intent.\n\nThus, his teaching seems entirely distinct from the **Six Classics**.\n\nYet, by examining his spoken words to infer what he does not say, and by seeking what he cannot help but imply despite his reluctance to speak openly, one finds that **virtue** (*Dé*), **righteousness** (*Rén*), and **rites** (*Yì*) are never truly absent, nor are **taxes** (*Shuì*), **punishments** (*Xíng*), **military force** (*Bīng*), **criminal law** (*Xíng*), and the **practical tools of daily life**—**chickens, dogs, boats, and carts** (*Jī Quǎn Zhōuchē*).\n\nThough his words often exalt **Non-Having**, they never truly abandon **Having**.\n\nIn the first chapter, he reaches the extreme of **Dark** beyond **Dark**, yet he transcends the myriad **Mysterious** and governs their emergence.\n\nWhen observing **Having**, it frequently appears in contrast with the **Mysterious** and **Non-Having**, standing parallel yet distinct—this **Having** and these **instruments** (*Qì*) are never truly separate.\n\nSages’ wisdom, virtue, and righteousness are never truly discarded.\n\nThus, when reading Laozi’s words, within the utmost **Non-Having**, one finds the **virtue/power** (*Dé*) of all **Having** and **Mysterious**—it must originate from **tracing** (*Jiànjì*).\n\nHuang Maocai says: *“The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is not the **constant Non-Having**.”*\n\n**Constant** (*Cháng*) here means **enduring** and **permanent**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** begins and ends with Heaven and Earth—how could it be anything but enduring and permanent? Who could truly speak of it?\n\nIf the **Dao/Way** could be spoken of and named, then the world’s understanding would suffice as **constant**.\n\nThe Classics say: *“I do not know its name, so I call it **Dao/Way**.”*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is singular and absolute—why then does it oppose **name** (*Míng*)?\n\nLaozi’s intent is to reveal the **enduring and permanent** **Dao/Way** to people, is it not?\n\n**Non-Having** is the **mother of myriad things**.\n\nAt the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**, was there truly **Non-Having**?\n\nIf there was indeed **Non-Having**, who then gave rise to it?\n\n**Non-Having** is **Non-Naming**—**Non-Naming** is **Non-Having**—it cannot be named, so it is called thus.»\n\n「When it has already come into existence, does it truly have something? It is only named thus to emphasize its power.\n\nThe Classics say: *“Vague and indistinct, yet within it there is form; indistinct and vague, yet within it there are things.”*\nAnd again: *“Things are formed in a chaotic unity.”*\nAll these are forced names.\n\nThe term **\"Non-Having\"** (母) refers to its capacity to generate things.\nOnly after Heaven and Earth came into being did myriad things arise—thus, the sequence is first Heaven and Earth, then myriad things. His words follow this order.\n\n**\"Non-Having\"** (无) and **\"Non-Wanting\"** (无欲) are said to reach the same state, called **\"Mysterious\"** (玄).\nThe Classics speak of **\"Not Wanting\"** (不欲), **\"Few Wants\"** (寡欲), and **\"Desires Abundant\"** (可欲多矣). Now, if one says **\"Non-Wanting\"** (无欲) and **\"Having Wants\"** (有欲), then it aligns with the Classics’ words.\n\nYet, **\"Non-Wanting\"** (无欲) may be called **\"constant\"** (常), but can **\"Having Wants\"** (有欲) also be called **\"constant\"** (常)?\nOne replies: Since things came into existence, those with **nine orifices** (*jiǔqiào*) are born from the womb, and those with **eight orifices** (*bāqiào*) are born from eggs—all due to desire. Desire begets life, which begets more life, and this cycle has no end. Thus, even **\"Having Wants\"** (有欲) may be called **\"constant\"** (常).\n\nPeople know that **\"Non-Having\"** (无) arises from the **Dao/Way** (*Dào*), but they do not know that **\"Having\"** (有) also arises from the **Dao/Way** (*Dào*).\nHow could they know that both **\"Having\"** and **\"Non-Having\"** emerge from the **\"Mysterious\"** (玄)?\n\nThe **\"Mysterious\"** (玄) deepens into **\"Mysterious Again\"** (玄之又玄), the gateway to all wonders.\n\n**Nánbó Zǐ Kuài** said to **Rǔ Jiǎo**:\n“Where did you hear this from?”\nShe replied: *“I heard it from **Fù Mò’s son**, **Fù Mò’s son** heard it from **Luò Sòng’s grandson**, **Luò Sòng’s grandson** heard it from **Zhān Míng**, **Zhān Míng** heard it from **Niè Xǔ**, **Niè Xǔ** heard it from **Xū Yì**, **Xū Yì** heard it from **Yú Diàn**, **Yú Diàn** heard it from **Xuán Míng**, and **Xuán Míng** heard it from **Cān Liáo**, **Cān Liáo** heard it from **Yí Shǐ**.”\n\nThe **Dao/Way** grows ever more subtle yet ever more present; it becomes ever more refined yet cannot be exhausted.\nEven **Rǔ Jiǎo** heard it and reached **Yí Shǐ**—**\"Mysterious Again\"** (玄之又玄)—this is evident in her words.\nThus, it is the gateway to all wonders.\n\n---\n\n#1 From *Lǎozǐ’s* **\"Exhausting the Dao/Way without end\"** (穷道未故常): The character **\"未\"** (*wèi*) should likely be read as **\"末\"** (*mò*).\n\n**Volume Three of *The Collected Meanings of the *Dào Dé* *Zhēn Jīng*** (道德真经集义卷之三): *Níng Yuǎn Dàshī’s* **\"Observing the Mysterious Path of Constant Virtue\"** (常德路玄妙观).」\n\nThe **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is the gateway to the **Dao/Way**.\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** can be named, it is the **Dao/Way** of transient convention, not the **Dao/Way** of eternal, indestructible nature.\nWhen a **name** can be fixed, it is the **name** of transient value, not the **name** of enduring, indescribable worth.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** cannot be confined by elevation or suppression in argument.\nThus, it is said above: \"That which cannot be named,\" the origin of the chaotic **Heaven** and **Earth**,\nand \"That which can be named,\" the mother of all things born.\n\nHence, when one remains without **desire** yet stirs within the mind,\nit suffices to observe the **Dao/Way**’s profound subtlety;\nwhen one abides with **desire** yet moves in outward **emotion**,\nit suffices to observe the **Dao/Way**’s shifting manifestations.\n\nThese two arise from the same **Dao/Way**, yet differ in subtle and manifest forms—\nthus they are both called **\"Mysterious\"** (玄).\n\n**\"Mysterious Again\"** (玄之又玄), yet all-pervasive,\nthis is the gateway to all wonders.\n\nThe **Dao/Way**’s subtlety defies naming,\nso this chapter first names it as the mother of all things born,\nthen as the shifting manifestations of **desire**,\nand as the **\"Mysterious\"** origin.\n**\"Mysterious Again\"** is the gateway to all wonders.\n\nTo say \"mother,\" \"manifestations,\" \"gateway\"—\nis this not the progression from essence to form,\nfrom embodying the **Dao/Way** to attaining its wondrous applications?\n\n**Zhāng Chōng Yìng** replied: The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is the gateway to the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **Great Dao/Way** is formless, giving birth to **Heaven** and **Earth**.\nThe **Great Dao/Way** is nameless, nurturing all things.\nHumans cannot embody this natural **Dao/Way**,\nyet they cling to the **Dao/Way** of scriptures and governance,\nseeking fame, display, and the attainment of transient **names**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** they speak of is the **Dao/Way** that can be attained by the world,\nnot the **Dao/Way** of eternal, unerodible nature.\nThe **name** they speak of is the **name** that can be attained by the world,\nnot the **name** of far-reaching, indescribable worth.\n\nTo embody the **Dao/Way** that cannot be named is to be nameless;\nto embody the **Dao/Way** that can be named is to have a **name**.\nNameless, the **Dao/Way** is vast—\nlike **Heaven** covering and **Earth** bearing,\nchaotic in its origin, yet unknown to humans as the source of covering and bearing.\nNamed, the **Dao/Way** is small—\nlike all things sprouting and branching,\ndistinguishing good and evil, each having its **name**.\n\nThe root of their good and evil is called the nameless **Dao/Way**,\nthe beginning of **Heaven** and **Earth**.\nThe named is the mother of all things.\n\nBetween **Heaven** and **Earth**, humans live with flesh and blood as their body,\nthe mind governing the five senses.\nWhen embodying the **Dao/Way**, there is the ability to rest within my **desire**-less stillness,\nto observe the **Dao/Way** that cannot be spoken of or named;\nand to move in outward **desire**,\nto observe the **Dao/Way**’s shifting manifestations.\nThus, I attain its essence and know the world’s shifting inclinations.\n\nThis **desire** of mine and the world’s, both arising from the same mind yet differing in **name**,\nis called **\"Mysterious\"**.\nI esteem the **\"Mysterious\"** of **desire**-lessness,\nwhile the world esteems the **\"Mysterious\"** of **desire** as equally noble.\nObserving the world’s **\"Mysterious\"** of **desire**,\nthen reflecting upon my own **\"Mysterious\"** of **desire**-lessness,\nthis is the crucial ground for advancing and refining the **Great Dao/Way**—\nthis is called the gateway to all wonders.\n\n**Zhāng Líng Yìng** said: Nameless, it is the beginning of **Heaven** and **Earth**.\nNamed, it is the mother of all things.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is originally nameless,\nbut through **qi** transformation it gains **name**.\n**Qi** emerging from the nameless has no **name** to be fixed—\n**Heaven** clears, **Earth** settles, and the **Dao/Way** begins from here.\n**Qi** coalescing into form has **names** to be fixed—\nbranches, leaves, and kinds all trace back to their mother.\n**Qi** transforms into things,\nthings contain the **Dao/Way**—\nhumans are but one thing among them.\nTo trace its origin and guard its mother,\nthis is the path to entering the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**Bái Yù Chán** said:\nThe **Dao/Way**—\nnothing more than this.\nThat which can be spoken of is not the **Dao/Way**.\nThat which can be said is not as it is.\nThe **name** is a forced designation of the **Dao/Way**.\nThat which can be named is not the true **name**.\nTo call it the **Dao/Way** is already to misname it.\nThe **Dao/Way** is **emptiness**.\n\nThis is the **Dao/Way**.\nThe beginning of **Heaven** and **Earth** is called **\"Unnamed\"** (无).\nThe **Dao/Way** generates **\"One\"** (一), which is the initial chaos of **Heaven** and **Earth**—\n**\"One\"** generates **\"Two\"** (二), **\"Two\"** generates **\"Three\"** (三),\n**\"Three\"** generates all things.\nThus, **\"One\"** is named the mother of all things.\n\n**\"One\"** without form generates all **\"Ten Thousand Things\"** (万有),\nall **\"Ten Thousand Things\"** return to **\"One\"** without form—\nhence, one must always remain with an **emptiness**-filled mind,\nwithout thought,\nto observe its subtlety.\nWhen one sees things, one knows the **Dao/Way**;\nwhen one knows the **Dao/Way**, one sees the mind.\nOne must always guard the central **emptiness** and embrace **\"One\"**,\nto observe its shifting manifestations.\n\nThe body has birth and death,\nthe mind has none—\nthese two are the **\"Ten Thousand\"** (万) and the **\"One\"** (一).\n**\"One\"** without form is also without form—\nwithin the **emptiness** there is no **emptiness**,\nsame origin yet different **names**—\nall **dharma/laws** return to **\"One\"**,\nthe mind is fundamentally **emptiness**—\nthus they are both called **\"Mysterious\"**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is not **emptiness**-seeking **desire**;\n**emptiness** naturally returns.\nHumans, when they achieve **emptiness**-filled minds,\nthe **Dao/Way** naturally returns to **\"One\"**.\n\n**\"Mysterious Again\"**—\nwithin **emptiness**, the true is hidden;\nfrom **emptiness**, form arises—\nthe gateway to all wonders.\nAwakening enters from here,\nits application is endless.\n\n**Liào Cuì Rán** said:\nThe **Dao/Way**—\nthe **Dao/Way** of **Primordial Beginning** (元始) can be spoken of,\nand is called the **Dao/Way**, yet it is not the **Dao/Way**,\nnor the ordinary **Dao/Way** spoken of by the world.\nThe **name**—\nthe **name** of the **Supreme Primordial** (太上) can be fixed,\nand is called the **Dao/Way**, yet it is not the true **name**,\nnor the common **name** invoked by all.\n\n**\"Unnamed\"** (无)—\n**\"Unnamed\"** (无极) is named the beginning of **Heaven** and **Earth**,\nthe **Supreme Primordial** (太初) initiating birth.\nThe **\"Great Polarity\"** (太极) is named the mother of all things.\n\n**Movement** and **stillness** are mutually rooted—\nalways relying on this pillar and guide,\nusing **desire** to observe its subtlety.\nThe **yellow middle** (黄中) harmonizes principles,\ncorrectly positioned within the body,\nits beauty contained within,\nflowing through the four limbs—\nalways abiding with **desire** is like this **eye** (眦),\noften guarding the **form**,\nusing **desire** to observe its shifting manifestations.\n\nTo sever limbs and discard wisdom,\nto abandon form and discard intellect,\nto align with the **Great Dao/Way**—\nthese two arise from the same **qi**,\nyet differ in **name**,\nthe first three three, the latter three three—\nboth are called **\"Mysterious\"**, yet they converge in **\"One\"**.\n\n**\"Mysterious Again\"**—\nas it is, as it is—\nthe gateway to all wonders.\nThe wondrous mystery of gathering **\"One\"** into **\"Ten Thousand\"**\nand dispersing **\"Ten Thousand\"** into **\"One\"**, endless generation.\n\n**Chén Bì Xū** said:\nThe **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is not the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is vast and difficult to speak of—\nnot something the divine mouth can discern.\nThus the mind is perplexed and cannot know,\nthe tongue falters and cannot discuss it—\nit lies within the human **spiritual treasury** (*lingfu*), to be self-awakened alone.\n\nIt is called **\"Non-Action\"**—\nfor it is **naturally** so.\n\nNow, to label the **Dao/Way** is already to impose a name,\nand thus it belongs to the **\"speakable\"** realm.\nOnce it is said to be **\"speakable\"**, then there are changes and shifts,\nwords and explanations—\nthis is no different from teachings and doctrines, mere dregs of wisdom.\n\nLet us attempt to raise what should be kept silent,\nand from instruction explain:\n**\"Dao\"** means **\"pervasive\"**—\nspeaking of how all things, obtaining it, find no obstruction,\nno boundary.\n\nIt is also called **\"Dao\"**—**\"to tread\"**—\ntaking the path as its metaphor.\n*The Classic of Graphs* says: **\"Dao\"** is **\"the way one walks.\"**\nOne path leads—this is called **\"Dao.\"**\n\nAncient sages and modern scholars embody and practice it,\nthus it is called **\"Dao.\"**\n\nAs for **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust**—\nthe five **constants**—\nthese are all the **applications** of **Dao**.\n\nWhen applied, it is called **\"speakable.\"**\nOnce **\"speakable\"** is made clear,\nthen it is no longer the **\"unspeakable.\"**\n\nThe **\"unspeakable Dao\"** is **naturally** so,\nresponding to stimuli, adapting without end.\nIt cannot be transmitted by words,\ncannot be sought by intellect—\nonly by embodying the **mysteries of transformation**,\ncontaining light, hiding radiance,\ndoing **Non-Action** yet accomplishing all—\nsilently attaining its utmost.\n\n**Yán Jūn Píng** said:\nThe **\"speakable Dao\"**—\nwhen **virtue/power** and **Dao** are made manifest,\nthey are no longer **natural**.\n\nHe also said:\nThose who now hold **Dao** but do not wield it like a torch—\nthey claim to be **\"enlightened.\"**\nBut **\"enlightened\"** is the **Dao** that is **not the Dao**—\nthe **\"unspeakable.\"**\nTo wield a torch is to make the **\"speakable Dao\"** manifest.\n\nWhat is inscribed on bamboo and silk,\ncarved into metal and stone,\nwhat can be passed to others—\nthis is the **\"speakable Dao.\"**\n\nBut what can be transmitted yet not received,\nwhat can be obtained yet not seen—\nits roots and origins,\nbefore heaven and earth existed,\nfrom ancient times onward, eternally abiding—\nthe **spirits, gods, and divine emperors** who gave birth to heaven and earth—\nthis is the **\"unspeakable Dao.\"**\n\nThe **Five Thousand Characters** unfold from these few words,\ntruly the **\"profound yet deeper\"**,\nthe **\"divine yet more divine.\"**\n\nWhat can be named is not the **true name**.\nThe **Dao** is **embodiment**,\n**name** is its **application**.\nApplication arises from embodiment,\nnames emerge from the **Dao**.\nOnce a name is given,\nit can be invoked in use.\nWhen use is established,\nit is called **\"nameable.\"**\nOnce **\"nameable\"** is fixed,\nit is no longer the **\"true name.\"**\n\nThe **\"true name\"** refers to its boundless applications,\nfragmenting its **virtue/power**.\n**Yán Jūn Píng** said:\nThe **\"nameable name\"**—\nwhen **achievement and reputation** are displayed,\nthey are not the **original truth**.\n\n**Lǐ Zǐ**, dwelling in the **Jīng Garden** for forty years,\nno one recognized him—\nthe king and ministers treated him like commoners.\nThis was truly one who guarded the **\"true name.\"**\n\nThus, the **Dao** is always **nameless**—\nthis is what is meant.\n\n**\"Nameless\"** is the beginning of heaven and earth.\n**\"Nameless\"** refers to the **Dao** itself.\nBefore the ten thousand transformations took form,\nthere was no imposed name—\nonly the **mystery of origins** descending,\nthe **primordial simplicity** about to disperse—\nthen the **Great Polarity** of the *Yì Jīng* emerged.\n\n**Yán Jūn Píng** said:\n**\"Nameless\"** and **\"no trace\"**—\nuniting with the **Divine**,\nthe world relies upon it,\nyet none know how it transforms from **emptiness**—\nthe beginning of heaven and earth.\nThis is the **embodiment of Dao**.\n\n**\"Named\"** is the **mother of all things**.\n**\"Named\"** refers to heaven and earth.\nHeaven nurtures, earth transforms—\nnourishing all things,\nprotecting and harming them like a mother to her child.\nThus it is called **\"Named,\"** the **mother of all things**.\n\nThe **Great Dao** is vast and obscure—\nhow could it be bound by **\"Named\"** or **\"Nameless\"**?\nMoreover, the sage adapts use to establish teachings,\nto clarify the **principles and traces** of **Dao**—\nthe **new teachings** of each age\nare all called **\"Nameless.\"**\nThus, what **begins** all things is **\"Nameless,\"**\nwhat **completes** all things is **\"Named.\"**\n\n**Yán Jūn Píng** said:\nThe **\"Named\"** in its **transformations**—\nhonors **virtue/power and Dao**,\nvalues **divine clarity**,\nfollows the **Great Harmony**,\naligns with heaven and earth—\nthus it is the **mother of all things**.\nThis is the **application of Dao**.\n\nAlways **without desire**, observe its **mystery**;\nalways **with desire**, observe its **boundaries**.\n\n**\"Desire\"** is the mind chasing after phenomena.\n**\"Mystery\"** is the **essence**, the utmost subtlety.\n**\"Boundary\"** is the **edge**, the **corner**—\nthe **Dao** has small paths at its edges,\nalso its **return**.\n\nThe **Dao of emptiness** is **silent and unmoving**—\nthis is **\"without desire.\"**\nWhen it **responds and gives birth** to all things—\nthis is **\"with desire.\"**\n**\"Without desire\"** observes **mystery**—\nguarding **emptiness**.\n**\"With desire\"** observes **boundaries**—\nthis is **contemplation**.\n\n**\"Constant\"** refers to the **true and enduring**—\nthe **Great Dao** itself.\n**\"Without desire\"** and **\"with desire\"**—\nthese are the **applications of Dao**.\n\nThe **Dao** originally has no form;\nthings **stimulate** the **Dao** to manifest.\nWhat is **\"above form\"** is called **\"Dao,\"**\nwhat is **\"below form\"** is called **\"instrument.\"**\nThe **superior person** knows the subtle and the manifest,\nperceiving what has not yet come and exhausting its **mystery**—\nthus it is said: **\"Always without desire, observe its mystery.\"**\n\nThe **middle person** follows along, yielding to things,\nseeing their **material forms** before grasping their use—\nthus there are **ten thousand differences**,\ntrue principles are hard to fathom—\nonly glimpsing their **edges**.\n\nAnother explanation:\nThe **constant person** embodies the **Dao’s** subtlety,\nguards the **essence of stillness**,\nrestores the **extremes of nature and life**,\nnot seduced by external things—\nthen the will and intentions are **empty and vast**,\nable to observe the **Dao’s** **essence**,\nreaching the **utmost of subtlety**.\n\n**Yán Jūn Píng** said:\nThe heart like **metal and stone**, the form like **dry wood**,\nsilent and secluded, the will like a **foal or calf**—\nthese are the **\"without desire,\"** restoring the **roots of nature and life**.\n\nMoreover, the **\"with desire\"** clings to phenomena,\nlosing the **broad path**—\nonly seeing the **small edges**,\nlost and not returning,\nlosing the **true essence**.\n\nSome ancient sages said:\nThe **\"without desire\"**—\nembodies **Dao** through inner observation,\ntransforming all beings,\nwith no thoughts or storage,\nforgetting their **original progress**.\n\nThe **\"with desire\"**—\nfrom the **root**, applies **Dao**,\nestablishes teachings to respond to things,\naccomplishes **benefiting all**,\nsees the **end of things**,\nfully knows their **return**.\n\n「Thus, the former speaks of **restraining the self**, the latter of **transforming the people**—\nto cultivate the self and govern the realm,\nthe **Dao/Way** is never left incomplete.\n\nThese two are the same in essence,\nbut the latter refers to **higher matters**—\nthe two being the **namable and unnamable**,\nthe **desiring and without desire**.\n\nBoth are contained within the **stillness and immobility** of **emptiness (寂然)**,\nthe **profound source (湛尔之源)**,\nwhere **substance and function** remain indistinct,\nand **good and evil** are indistinct as well—\nthus they are called the same.\n\nYet when they manifest differently,\nit means **descending from the root** to **traceable forms**,\nthe **Dao/Way** gradually becoming **distinct**,\nthough originating from the mind of one individual,\nthe **Five Constants (五常)** apply in varied ways—\nthe **virtue/power** of the wise and foolish differ,\ntheir **transformations** are countless,\nand their **lifespans and fates** diverge—\nthus, when they emerge, their names differ.\n\nThe same is called **profound (玄)**,\n**profound beyond profound**.\n\n**Depth (渊)** is profound subtlety,\n**obscurity (冥)**,\n**heavenly (天)**.\nWhat is called **heavenly** is **natural (自然)**.\n\nThis **namable and unnamable**,\n**desiring and without desire**—\nall receive **qi** from **heaven**,\nand inherit their **nature** from **naturalness (自然)**,\nharmonizing within and without,\nassuming countless forms—\narising from **profound beyond profound**,\n**spiritual beyond spiritual**,\nwhat is called **self-so (自然而然)**.\n\nThose who **penetrate and comprehend** this profound subtlety,\n**piercing the obscurity (冥默)**—\nthese are called those with **profound virtue (有渊德)**.\n\nThus **Yán Jūn Píng** said:\n**\"Profound beyond profound\"**—\nthis is what he meant, is it not?\n\nThe **gateway to all marvels (众妙之门)****\nis called the **domain of the Dao/Way (道域)**.\n\nThe **Great Dao/Way** is vast and unbounded,\nwith no limits or confines,\nno gates or byways—\nit is the **august sovereign (皇皇)** of fourfold passage.\n\nWhen discussed in terms of **restraining the self**,\nit emerges as common to all people,\nbut when withdrawn, it becomes the **marvelous root**.\n\nWhen taught to the masses,\nthe **truths (众真)** expound the marvelous and emerge,\nwhile the **sages (群圣)** contain the marvelous and return—\ntheir **transformation and guidance** are boundless,\nyet **stillness (湛然)** remains singular,\n**independent and unchanging**—\nthis is called **knowing the Constant (知常)**.\n\nSince there is **entry and emergence (出入)**,\nit is thus called a **gateway**.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said:\nThere is the **gateway of life**,\nthere is the **gateway of death**,\nthere is the **gateway of return**—\n**entry and emergence**, yet no form is seen—\nthis is called the **Heavenly Gateway (天门)**.\n\nThe **Heavenly Gateway** is **the Unmanifest (无有)**.\nAll things emerge from **the Unmanifest**,\nand thus it is also called the **gateway to all marvels**.\n\n**Xie Tu'nan** said:\n**\"The Dao/Way that can be named\"** is the **Constant Name (至常名)**.\n\nWhat is called the **Dao/Way**?\nThe **Classics (经)** say: **\"The Dao/Way follows naturalness (自然)\"**,\nso the **Dao/Way** is **self-so (自然而然)**,\nnot something that can be **made so (使然)**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** originally has no name;\nit is called the **Dao/Way** because its **fourfold passage and eightfold reach (四通八辟)****\ncan be **shared and followed (共行)**,\nlike roads and paths.\n**Mencius** said: **\"The Dao/Way is like a great road.\"**\nThis is exactly what he meant.\n\nThe **\"namable Dao/Way\"** is like saying **\"followable\"**,\nthe **\"nameable\"** is like saying **\"worthy of mention.\"**\n\nWhy does the world not follow this **Dao/Way**,\nwhile the people use it daily without knowing?\nWithin the **\"namable and unnamable\" Dao/Way**,\nthere exists an **extraordinary marvel (非常之妙)**.\n\nThe **Zhōng Yōng (《中庸》)** says:\nEven the **foolish commoners (夫妇之愚)** can share in **knowing**,\nbut when it reaches its **ultimate (至)**,\neven the **sages** have things they do not know.\n\nEven the **unworthy commoners (夫妇之不肖)** can share in **following**,\nbut when it reaches its **ultimate**,\neven the **sages** have things they cannot do.\n\nThis is called the **\"extraordinary\"**—\nthat which is **unknowable and unattainable**, is it not?\n\nThe **Unmanifest Mother (无名至之母)** of the **ultimate**.\nBefore **heaven and earth** existed,\nthis **Dao/Way** was already present,\nyet its name had not yet been established.\nWhen the **Great Ultimate (太极)** was divided,\n**heaven and earth and all things** arose from the **Dao/Way**,\nholding the meaning of a **mother**,\nwhile the **Dao/Way** itself was only later named.\n\nThough all things arise with **ten thousand differences (万不同)**,\nthey share the same **mother**.\n\nHaving examined this thoroughly,\nthere are **forms (形)**,\nthere are **forms of forms (形形)***,\nthere are **transformations (化)**,\nthere are **transformations of transformations (化化)***.\n\n**Forms** are forms indeed,\nyet **forms of forms** have never truly been forms.\n**Transformations** are transformations indeed,\nyet **transformations of transformations** have never truly been transformations.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is named **post-heaven**,\nyet it is the **pre-heaven** that is **unnamed**.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present,\n**forms** arise from **qi** and **transformations**—\nwithout beginning or end—\nwho is it that makes this so?\n\n**Vague and indistinct (惚兮恍兮)**,\nyet within there are **images (象)**;\n**still and empty (寂兮寥兮)**,\nyet **independent and unchanging**—\n**effortless yet nothing is left undone (无为而无不为)***,\n**nowhere yet everywhere present (无在而无不在)***—\nis this not what is called the **Unnamed**?\nIs this not what is called the **Extraordinary**?\n\nThus I say:\n**Forms of forms** have never truly been forms,\n**transformations of transformations** have never truly been transformations.\nHence, there is no **gateway to the Ultimate (常无至之门)**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the **mother of all things**,\nand **humans** are but one thing among **heaven and earth**.\nSince **humans** arise from the **Dao/Way**,\nthen the **Dao/Way** is within **my own body**.\n\nThus, **desiring and without desire**—\n**returning inward** to observe the **Dao/Way** within **my own self**—\nthis is the **foundation of cultivation (修身)** spoken of by **Lǎozǐ**.\n\nThe **marvelous (妙)** lies within—\nin the **root (本)**.\nThe **small edges (徼)** lie without—\nin the **end (末)**.\n\nWhat **humans** rely upon to stand firm\nis only **essence (精)** and **spirit (神)**.\n\nThe **Classics (经)** say:\n**\"Deep and mysterious (窈窈冥冥)\"**,\nwithin it there is **essence**—\nits **essence** is most **true (甚真)**,\nand within it there is **faith (信)**.\n\nWhen one is **without desire**,\nthen **still and unmoving (寂然不动)**,\n**essence and spirit** blend harmoniously—\nthus one can observe its **marvelousness**.\n\nWhen one is **with desire**,\nthen **sensations arise and pass (感而遂通)***,\n**essence and spirit** separate—\nthus one can observe its **small edges**.\n\n**Essence** arises from **profound (玄)**,\n**profound** being **heaven (天)**—\n**heaven** first generates **water (水)**,\nwater’s nature is **moist and descending (润下)**,\nfrom **Qián (乾, Heaven)** to **Kǎn (坎, Water)** as the **kidneys (肾)**—\nthis is the **profound** truly flowing through.\n\nThus it is said:\n**\"Same origin, different names (同出异名)\"**,\n**from the small edges into marvelousness (由徼入妙)**—\nthen the **profound** of the lower returns to the **upper**,\nand one can enter the **gateway to all marvels**.\n\n**Huán Kǎi** said:\nThe **gateway to the Dao’s marvels (道妙之门)***\nis indeed **above Kunlun (昆仑)**.\nThen one should seek it at **Qián (乾, Heaven)** as the **beginning**.\n\nHaving examined this thoroughly,\n**one yin and one yang** is called the **Dao/Way**—\n**self-so (自然而然)**.\n\n**Humans** inherit **yin and yang qi** to arise,\nand **desire and without desire** are also their **naturalness**.\n**Essence and spirit** have the same origin,\nrooted in **one heaven (一天)**—\nfrom **marvelousness to small edges (自妙而徼)**,\n**heaven** is **human**.\n\nIt is like **water**—\n**one heaven** generates it,\nits **source** is originally the same,\nfrom **source to tributary to river (源祖流)***,\nthe same begins to differ—\nthus, the **small edges** are its **river**,\nthe **marvelous** is its **source**.」\n\n「The **Dao/Way** beyond the **Dao/Way**—\nthen one follows the **river** to trace its **source**,\nand thus unites with **my heaven** in **one**.\n\nIn ancient times, **Emperor Yellow (黄帝)** ventured westward,\nreturning without his **marvelous pearl (玄珠)**.\nHe sent the **clear-eyed man (明目人)** **Lí Lóu (离娄)** to seek it,\nwho failed.\nThen he sent **Wàng Xiàng (罔象)**, who found it.\n\nTo know **Emperor Yellow’s marvelous pearl**—\nthen one knows **Laozi’s** **most marvelous Dao/Way (玄玄)**.\n\n**Lín Chǐng (林鬳斋)** said:\n**\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of\"**—\nthis passage stands at the **beginning of the book**,\nand the **great essence of the entire book** is all contained here.\nIts meaning is that **the Dao/Way** originally **does not admit of speech**.\nOnce speech is introduced, it is all **second-order meaning (第二义)**.\n\n**\"Constant\"** refers to **unchangeable, immutable**—\n**what can be spoken of and named** is changeable and mutable;\n**what cannot be spoken of or named** is unchangeable and immutable.\nWith **names like benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom (仁义礼智)**,\nthe benevolent cannot be said to be righteousness,\nthe proper cannot be said to be wisdom.\nWith **names like spring, summer, autumn, and winter (春夏秋冬)**,\nspring cannot be said to be summer,\nautumn cannot be said to be winter.\nThus, **the constant Dao/Way is not the spoken Dao/Way**.\n\nAt the **beginning of heaven and earth (天地之始)**,\nit was the time before **the Great Polarity (太极)*** was divided.\nIn **human mind**, it is the **still, unmoving state (寂然不动)**.\nBefore **the Great Polarity** was divided,\nhow could there be names like spring, summer, autumn, and winter?\nIn the **still, unmoving state**,\nhow could there be names like benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom?\nThus, it is said: **\"The nameless\"** is the **beginning of heaven and earth**.\n\nWhen it speaks of **\"heaven and earth\" (天地)***,\nit does not refer solely to heaven and earth.\nIt is a metaphor for **this mind (此心)**.\n\nOnce **yin and yang (阴阳)** are named,\nthen **ten thousand changes and myriad transformations (千变万化)** all arise from them.\nOnce **benevolence and righteousness (仁义)** are named,\nthen **ten thousand branches and myriad threads (千条万端)** all begin from them.\nThus, it is said: **\"The named\"** is the **mother of all things (万物之母)**.\n**Mother** means **from this they are generated**.\n\nThe two phrases **\"constant\" and \"non-constant\"**—\nthis is where **Laozi** teaches people the **ultimate truth**.\nIn the **worldly realm (人世之间)**,\neach thing is **non-constant (有)**,\nyet who knows that this **non-constant** originates from **the constant**?\nIf one insists on **the constant** alone,\nthen **non-constant** will again arise—\nthe **reckless, chaotic acts (莽莽荡荡)** that invite **calamity and disaster (招殃祸)**.\n\nThus, those who study the **Dao/Way** must, in the **constant state (无时)***,\nseek the **ultimate truth (无上究竟)** of the **constant**,\nand see the **marvelousness (妙)** of how **non-constant** arises.\nOr, in the **non-constant state (有时)***,\nseek the **ultimate truth (有上究竟)** of the **non-constant**,\nand see its **source (徼)** from **the constant**.\n\n**\"Source\"** is what **The Book of Rites (礼记)*** calls\n**the hidden depths of mountains and rivers (窍於山川之窍)***—\nspeaking of **its origin (所自出)**.\n\nThe two **\"desire\" (欲)** characters here have deep meaning.\n**\"Desire\"** means **to seek earnestly**—\nto seek earnestly this **ultimate truth**.\nThough **constant** and **non-constant** appear as two,\nthough they bear different names,\ntheir origin is the same.\nIf one can observe **constant** and **non-constant** with **the constant** in mind,\nthen both are called **Dao/Way**.\n\n**\"Dao/Way\"** is the **marvelousness of transformation (造化之妙)***.\nObserving it thus,\nhow could **Laozi’s teachings** be said to **exclusively uphold emptiness and nothingness (虚无)**?\nIf one **exclusively adheres to the constant**,\nthen one cannot acknowledge that both **constant** and **non-constant** share the same origin—\nthat is not called **\"Dao/Way\"** as **Dao/Way**.\n\n**\"Dao/Way beyond the Dao/Way\"**—\nthe **gateway to all marvels**.\nThis is what **Zhuangzi (庄子)*** praises as:\n**\"What has a beginning\"**—\n**\"what has no beginning yet has a beginning\"**—\n**\"what has no beginning yet has no beginning\"**—\nbut only **extols its marvelousness**, with no other meaning.\nIf one says **\"there is another layer above this layer\"**, then it is not his **original intent**.\n\n**\"All marvels\"** are what **The Book of Changes (易)*** calls:\n**\"the marvelousness of all things\"**.\n**\"Gateway\"** refers to **its origin**.\n\nMany people discuss this passage only in terms of **heaven and earth**,\nyet they fail to grasp **Laozi’s true intent**—\nto **examine it within the mind**.\nOnly by **viewing it together** can one attain the **full meaning of this book**.\n\n**Fàn Yìngyuán (范应元)** said:\n**\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of\"**—\n**not the constant Dao/Way**.\n\n**Dao/Way** is the **principle of nature (自然之理)**,\nthe **origin of all things (万物之所由)**.\n**What can be spoken of** means **what can be expressed in words**.\n**\"Constant\"** means **enduring**.\n\n**Dao/Way** is **one**,\nyet it has **substance and function (体用)***.\nNo one has ever **known its function without first grasping its substance**.\n**Substance** must be established first,\nthen **function** can be put into practice.\n\n**Laozi’s** teaching begins by **clarifying its substance**—\n**\"constant\"** refers to **its substance**,\n**\"what can be spoken of\"** refers to **its function**.\n**Substance and function** share a **single source**,\nnot two separate **Dao/Way**.\n\nNow, **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom**—\nthese are **what can be spoken of**,\nall **functions of the Dao/Way**.\n\nPeople merely know:\n**the heart of compassion (恻隐之心)** as the **beginning of benevolence (仁之端)***,\n**the heart of shame and dislike (羞恶之心)** as the **beginning of righteousness (义之端)***,\n**the heart of decorum and yielding (辞让之心)** as the **beginning of propriety (礼之端)***,\n**the heart of distinction and judgment (是非之心)** as the **beginning of wisdom (智之端)***,\nyet they fail to recognize\nthat **the Dao/Way’s single substance (体之一)** is **the Dao/Way itself**.\n\n**Divided and scattered** in four directions,\nthe **endless branches (末流)*** bring **no small harm (不胜其弊)***.\n\nOnly if one **first knows its single substance**,\nthen **daily life and constant practice** will naturally reveal itself in **each affair**,\nwithout fail—\nall **the principle of nature (自然之理)**.\n\nThus, it will endure **without harm** for long.\nTherefore, whatever **Dao/Way** can be spoken of,\nit is **not the constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way**—\n**has form yet is formless (有形)***,\n**is formless yet has essence (无形)***,\nits **greatness knows no outer limit (大无外)**,\nso it **embodies all without exclusion (无不包)**;\nits **smallness knows no inner limit (小无内)**,\nso it **penetrates all without omission (细无不入)**,\n**all-pervasive (无不通)**.\n\nSeeking it in **the initial state of my mind (吾心之初)***,\none will attain it.\n\n**All people** are born from this,\n**sages and worthies** stand by embodying this.\nYet though this **Dao/Way** **pervades all affairs (周行乎事物之际)***,\n**is transmitted through scriptures (相传乎典籍之中)***,\nits **marvelous depths**—\n**affairs cannot mingle with them (事物莫能杂)***,\n**words cannot reach them (言辩莫能及)***—\nso few people **attain mastery (鲜造诣)***.\n\n**Laozi** **responded to the times (应运)** and **delivered his teachings (垂教)***,\n**revealing the Dao/Way out of necessity (不得已而发明)***,\nhow could it be **separated from words (离乎言)**?\nThus, he begins with:\n**\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of\"**—\n**not the constant Dao/Way**,\nintending to make people **know the constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way**,\n**not in words (不在言哉)**,\nbut to **seek it within themselves (反求诸己)***,\nand **attain it in the initial state of my mind (自得之於吾心之初)***.\n\n**\"The name that can be named\"**—\n**not the constant name**.\n\n**Name** is like **a person’s given name**.\nAll **names that can be named** are **what can be spoken of**,\n**not the constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way**.\n\n「Moreover, take the case of all things: when they first arise, they do not yet have names—only the names given by past sages to distinguish them. All things with form can indeed be spoken of and named, but the constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way is the origin of all things, yet **without form (无形)**, so it cannot be spoken of or named.\n\n**\"The Unnamed (无名)\"** is the beginning of heaven and earth.\nBefore heaven and earth existed, this Dao/Way was already present, **indistinct and undifferentiated (浑沦未判)**, who could name it?\n**\"The Named (有名)\"** is the mother of all things.\nOnce **indistinct and undifferentiated (浑沦)** was clarified, heaven, earth, and all beings came into existence. The sage saw that this was the mother of all things yet **without form (无形)**, so he **forced a term upon it (强字)**, calling it Dao/Way, and **assigned a name to it (强为之名)**, calling it *Great (大)*. Because it was originally unnamed yet forced to be named, he did so that all people might **borrow this name (假此有名)** and **investigate its unnameable essence (探其无名)**, thereby **restoring its original state (以复其初)**.\n\nThus, **one must habitually lack desire (常无欲)** to perceive its subtlety (妙).\n**\"Habitually lacking desire (常无欲)\"**—**habitually without fixed speech (常无绝句)**, observing the *departing voice (去声)*, scrutinizing it closely (谛视).\n**\"Subtlety (妙)\"**—**the ultimate subtlety (徼妙)**, the constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way.\nFrom ancient times, it has always existed, yet **without form or sound (无形无声)**, so **exquisitely subtle (微妙)** that it cannot be fully exhausted. Hence, it is called *constant unnameable (常无)*, intending to **urge people to observe its subtlety (以观其微妙)**.\n\nOnly humans, born from this Dao/Way, are the most **responsive (灵)** of all things. If they truly **retrace the light and reflect inward (回光反视)** within themselves, **awakening to the single true essence (悟一真体)**, though it be **utterly void (至虚)**, yet **nothing is lacking (物无不备)**, then the Dao’s subtlety can be **perceived and observed (可得而观)**.\n\nThus, one comes to know that **one principle encompasses all particulars (一理包乎万殊)**, and all things and affairs **cannot defy (不可违)** the natural principle.\n\n**One must habitually have desire (常有欲)** to perceive its **manifestation (徼)**.\n**\"Habitually having desire (常有欲)\"**—**habitually with fixed speech (常有绝句)**, observing the *level voice (平声)*, **manifestation (徼)**, which is **to follow (循)**, **the realm (境)**, **or return (归)**.\nThe Great Dao/Way is natural and spontaneous, transforming and giving rise to all things. In heaven, it manifests as the forms of sun, moon, stars, and galaxies (星汉); on earth, as mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees; in humans, as the substance of **body, hair, and skin (身体发肤)**. Hence, it is called *constant having (常有)*, intending to **urge people to observe its manifestations (以观其境)**.\n\nOnly humans, **standing between heaven and earth (中天地)** as one of the *Three Powers (三才)*, if they **contemplate above and examine below (仰观俯察)** within the *Two Principles (两仪)*, realize that though all things have different forms, the principle is **never absent (无不在)**. Then, the Dao’s **manifestations and subtleties (境致)** can be **perceived and observed (可得而观)**.\n\nThus, one comes to know that **all particulars return to one principle (万殊归於一理)**, and all things and affairs **must follow (固当)** the natural principle.\n\nThese two—**constant unnameable (常无)** and **constant having (常有)**—are called *Dao (道)*.\n*\"Dao (道)\"* refers to **that which is profound and distant (深远)**, yet **cannot be distinguished (不可分别)**.\nIt is **neither non-existence (无)** without the ability to reveal existence (有),\nnor existence (有)** without the ability to reveal non-existence (无)**.\nExistence and non-existence **emerge together yet bear different names (同出而异名)**.\n\nIf one considers the Dao/Way as **non-existence (无)**, then all transformations arise from it.\nIf one considers the Dao/Way as **existence (有)**, then it is **formless and soundless (无形无声)**, ever **unchanging (常常不变)**.\nHence, it is said: **constant unnameable, constant having (常无常有)**.\n\nAbove the **non-existent and existent (无有)**, both are **marked with the character *constant (常)***, pointing to its **root (本)**.\nSince it is **neither existent nor non-existent (无有不二)**, yet **profound and distant (深远)**, it is exhaustively called *Dao (道)*.\n\nI have often thought that **existence and non-existence (有无)** alone are **insufficient to discuss the Dao/Way (论道)**.\nYet, from its **subtlety (微妙)**, one cannot avoid calling it *constant unnameable (常无)*;\nfrom its **manifestation (着见)**, one cannot avoid calling it *constant having (常有)*.\n\nWhen **divided (分而言之)**, subtlety is **refined (微)**, manifestation is **explicit (显)**;\nwhen **unified (合而言之)**, non-existence and existence **emerge together yet bear different names (同出而异名)**,\nand both **refined and explicit (妙徼)** are **one Dao/Way (一道)**.\nThis is how **Laozi** **combines non-existence and existence (兼有无)**, **penetrates explicit and refined (贯显微)**, **unifies same and different (合同异)** in his discourse.\n\nIf people can **observe in this manner (如是观之)**, then **refined and explicit (妙与徼)** will **communicate (相通)**, and **things and self (物与我)** will **merge indistinctly (浑融)**.\nInside and outside will be **clearly revealed (表里洞然)**,\nwith **no obstruction to its root (本无留碍)** nor **any distinction (无差别)**.\n\n*\"Dao that is again Dao (玄之又玄)\"*—\nthe **gateway to all subtleties (众妙之门)**.\nThe constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way **cannot be fully expressed by names or words (不可以名言)**.\nNow, since it is **forced to be termed (强字)** as Dao/Way,\nand from its **subtlety (微妙)**, it is called *constant unnameable (常无)*,\nand from its **manifestation (着见)**, it is called *constant having (常有)*.\nAgain, from its **root’s unity of existence and non-existence (本之有无不二)**,\nprofound and distant, yet **inexhaustible (难穷)**, it is **equally called *Dao (玄)***.\nAll these are **inevitably bound by words (不免乎言焉)**.\n\n*\"Dao that is again Dao (玄之又玄)\"*—\nthis is **like saying *profound that is again profound (深之又深)*, distant that is again distant (远之又远)***.\nIt is **neither non-existence nor existence (非无非有)**,\n**neither different nor the same (非异非同)**,\n**unknown in its *so-and-so-yet-so (所以然)***,\nyet **cannot be fully named or spoken of (终不可得而名言)**,\nfor it is **beyond distinction (分别)**.\n\nYet, all transformations arise from it, each **possessing its own subtlety (各各具妙)**,\nhence it is called **the gateway to all subtleties (众妙之门)**.\n\nLaozi **pities (悯)** that **people of the world chase superficiality (逐末)** while **forgetting the root (忘本)**,\nand **lose the true source (失真源)**.\nUnable to help but **respond to the times (应运)** and **deliver his teachings (垂训)**,\nhe also **fears that people will drown in words (溺於言辞)**,\nand **cannot reflect inward (弗能内观)**.\nThus, he **further instructs (示人以深意)**,\n**compelling them to seek within themselves (必使反求诸己)**,\n**desiring they attain it themselves (欲其自得之)**,\nand **enter the gateway to all subtleties (以入众妙之门)**,\n**restoring its original state (以复其初)**.\nThey can also **embody and act upon it (体是而行)**,\n**assisting the natural transformation of all things (以辅万物之自然)**,\nand **returning to unity (而同归于一)**.\n\nOnly humans are the most **responsive (灵)** of all things.\nIf they truly **reflect inward (反观)**, this Dao/Way **will remain luminously present (湛然常存)**—\nhow could it be **distant (远)**?\n\nThis chapter **directly points to the initial state of this mind (直指此心之初)**,\nthe natural principle,\n**preventing confusion over existence and non-existence, same and different (不惑於有无同异)**,\n**realizing the intent beyond words (得意忘言)**,\n**ascending to the profound and attaining subtlety (升玄及妙)**,\nand **entering the Dao’s gateway (乃入道之门)**.\n\n**Establishing the foundation of virtue (立德之基)**,\nthis is **the essence of the entire teaching (实一经之总)**.\nIt should be **deeply savored (宜深味之)**.\n\nXu Jun Yue said:\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is the gateway to the Dao/Way.\"*\nThe first four sentences state that the Dao/Way **cannot be conveyed through speech (不可以言语道说)**,\nnor **labeled with names (不可以名字题号)**.\n\nYet, **ancient sages who understood the Dao/Way (古之知道者)**,\n**wishing to guide people through words (欲因言语以示人)**,\n**could not help but assign names to it (则不得不立为名字)**,\nthough these were **not its originally inherent nature (非其本来固有)**.\n\nHence, the next four sentences **follow the previous (承上而言)**:\n*\"The Unnamed (无)\"* is what names **the beginning of heaven and earth (天地之始)**,\n*\"The Named (有)\"* is what names **the mother of all things (万物之母)**.\n**\"The beginning (始)\"** refers to **the Dao/Way beyond form (形而上之道)** before heaven and earth existed.\nThe Dao/Way **cannot be called non-existence (无)**, yet it is **formless, soundless, and without attributes (无声臭无形状)**—\nonly **forced to be named (借此而强名之耳)**.\n\nNow that the Dao/Way has been named, how can it also be called \"the Nameless\" as the mother of all things?\n\nThis refers to the period **after** heaven and earth came into being—speaking of the **manifested forms** beneath the Dao/Way. The Dao/Way does not arise only at this stage. Yet once it **adheres to these forms**, it takes on **concrete traces** and a **fixed position**, standing in contrast to the Nameless when spoken of.\n\nIf one points to this as \"the Named,\" what then is the \"Nameless\"? To sever the discussion with the terms \"Named\" and \"Nameless\" alone is to disrupt the logic.\n\nThe next four sentences then speak of those who embody the Dao/Way and turn inward to examine themselves. They first use the term *\"without desire\"* to express it—those who are perpetually without desire are **pure in Dao/Way and nature**, born in stillness. Here, one observes its **subtlety**.\n\n*\"Subtlety\"* means **so refined as to be invisible**, yet when one speaks of observing it, it must be **manifest yet not obscure**, revealing what others do not know.\n\nThose who truly understand it **always have desire**, for this is the human heart responding to external stimuli.\n\nFrom birth, humans are endowed with form, and the desires of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and limbs all have their objects—yet they cannot be entirely absent. Here, one observes its **boundaries**.\n\n*\"Boundaries\"* means **to follow through**, or the **extreme limits** of the heart’s desires, tracing where they lead without falling into ruin.\n\nThus, the Dao/Way and its manifestations are inseparable—what distinguishes humans from other beings.\n\nIn the realm of heaven and earth, it is called **\"the Nameless\"** and **\"the Named.\"**\nIn the human body, it is called **\"without desire\"** and **\"with desire.\"**\nIf one rigidly separates the terms \"Named\" and \"Nameless,\" the meaning still falls short.\n\nThese two aspects, though differently named, share the same origin and are both called **\"the Mysterious.\"**\nThough their names differ, their source is one.\n\n*\"The Mysterious\"* carries the meaning of **profound and distant**, and when it is said *\"the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious,\"* it is the **portal to all subtleties**—if one says this is the Dao/Way, it is **empty and boundless**, the most profound and distant, yet the source of all movement, stillness, yin, yang, and the transformations of all things.\n\nWhen Laozi speaks of the Dao/Way, he precedes this chapter and nowhere is it more crucial than here. Yet when our sages speak of the Dao/Way, they say it is **\"without sound, without scent, without form,\"** yet they do not call it simply **\"non-existence.\"**\nIf one follows the next chapter—*\"There is something formless and complete\"*—how could it be said the Dao/Way is merely non-existence?\n\nThe terms \"Named\" and \"Nameless\" do not contradict each other. Those who understand the Dao/Way **silently recognize it**, and only then do they grasp the meaning of **\"the Boundless\"** and **\"the Supreme Polarity,\"** a truth that will never confuse the ages to come.\n\nXue Yongzhai says:\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao/Way.\nSilent and unmoving, this is the Eternal Dao/Way.\nResponding and thus harmonizing, this is the Dao/Way that can be spoken of.\nBefore joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise, this is the Middle—**the Eternal Dao/Way**.\nWhen they arise yet remain measured, this is Harmony—**the Dao/Way that can be spoken of**.\nThe Eternal Dao/Way is its **essence**; the Dao/Way that can be spoken of is its **function**.\nFrom sincerity comes clarity—**applying essence to function**.\nFrom clarity comes sincerity—**applying function to essence**.\"*\n\nWen Xuanxian says:\n*\"To read Laozi without understanding essence and function is to make entry difficult.\nThe Name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.\nThe Nameless Name is the Eternal Name.\nThe Named Name is the Name that can be named.\nThe Nameless is the mother of all things.\nThe Dao/Way originally had no name; it lost heaven and earth, hence 'the beginning.'\nThe Dao/Way, once named, gives birth to all things, hence 'the mother.'\nThe Eternal 'without desire' leads to observing its subtlety.\nThe Nameless and Named speak of the Dao/Way;\nThe without desire and with desire speak of humanity.\nObserving subtlety while without desire is to observe its essence in stillness.\nObserving boundaries while with desire is to observe its function in action.\nTo fail to know essence and function is to grasp only one side—either subtlety or boundaries.\nThese two aspects, when seen as identical, are called 'the Mysterious.'\nWhen viewed from their differences, they are like the liver and gallbladder, Chu and Yue.\nWhen viewed from their unity, all things are one.\nIf difference and unity align, and subtlety and boundaries are both forgotten, this can be called 'the Mysterious.'\n'The Mysterious' is the fundamental principle of the Dao/Way.\n'The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious' is the gateway to all subtleties.\nThe Mysterious is difficult to know; even when known, it still depends on something, hence 'beyond the Mysterious' is discarded.\nIf one attains 'the Mysterious yet not the Mysterious,' subject and object merge, and the Great Harmony of all transformations emerges from this.\"*\n\nXiu Xiu An says:\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Name.\nEmpty yet luminous, tranquil yet profound—without form, without name, yet alive—this is called **True Emptiness**.\nExisting yet without form—this is called **Wondrous Being**.\nTrue Emptiness and Wondrous Being are boundlessly wondrous and profound.\nThose who attain the utmost honor it as the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way originally has no words; through words, it is revealed—this can be spoken of, yet it is not the common Dao/Way. It is the **Wondrous Dao/Way**, the **Great Dao/Way**.\n\n*'Wondrous'* means **encompassing all without exclusion**, penetrating all without omission, acting without action yet universally responsive, without selfishness or origin, yet endlessly wondrous and inexhaustible—without form yet manifesting all forms, without name yet establishing all names.\n\n*'Great'* means **without limit, without surpassing**, the most exalted and noble—it is the mother of **One Qi** and the ancestor of the **Three Powers**.\nThus, it is **Nameless**.\nIt is empty and luminous, without form—thus, it is **Nameless**.\nWhen One Qi moves, clarity and turbidity separate; when the Two Principles are positioned, yin and yang become evident; when the Three Powers are established, all things are born—now it can be named.\nThe Dao/Way that can be named is the **Wondrous Dao/Way**, the **Great Dao/Way**, the **Great Root** of the Three Powers.\n\nWhat is the **Great Root**?\nThe **clear and wondrous qi** is firm—above, it forms the image of **Heaven**.\nThe **wondrous yet turbid qi** is yielding—below, it takes form as **Earth**.\nThose who receive the **pure, true, and harmonious qi of luminous clarity** are **humanity**, where firmness and yielding balance.\nEmpty, luminous, and wondrous, in humans it is called **the Heart**, the sovereign of the body, the king of all things—also called **Nature**, which is **Life**.\n'Nature' is what is called **Heaven’s Command**.\nThe Nameless is the mother of all things.\nWithout form yet supremely empty and luminous, alive yet without sound or color—\nwithin it, One Qi emerges—this is called **the Primordial Origin of Heaven and Earth**.\nFrom this, the Three Powers are established, and the Three Generations give birth to all things—\nthus it is named, the **mother of all things**, and the world is complete.\"*\n\n「Though all things differ in form, they all receive the same **Heaven’s Grace** in their origin.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is without action, yet its **virtue/power** shines forth.\nThe **Dao/Way** is the **substance**; **virtue/power** is its **function**.\nWithout **substance**, **function** cannot arise;\nwithout **function**, **substance** lacks **wondrous efficacy**.\nTo act without action yet possess **wondrous efficacy**—this is the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **Primordial Origin of Heaven and Earth** is the **Gate of the Nameless**.\n\nThe **Laozi** taught that even self-benefit is universal benefit for all beings,\nsaying: *\"Always abandon all causes and conditions,\nand let no thought arise—\ncutting off all desires to perceive its **wondrous efficacy**.*\nFrom **wondrous efficacy** to **the Mysterious**,\none attains the **unobstructed Dao/Way**.\"\n\nThe **Confucian** school calls the **Dao/Way** the **Great Origin**,\nand its essence, *\"**joy, anger, sorrow, and delight** yet unmanifested,\"* is called **the Middle**.\nThe character **中 (Middle)** is but a symbol to convey this **Dao/Way**.\nIt cannot be understood by mere linguistic reasoning—\nlike pointing at the moon with a finger.\n\nWhen the first thought has yet to sprout,\none must fix the gaze to suddenly awaken and comprehend.\n\nThe **Buddhist** school calls the **Dao/Way** the **Real Suchness**,\nthe **True Thusness**,\nthe **Thusness of the Tathāgata**,\nand the **Dharma of Non-Birth**,\nand its essence, *\"**not thinking of good, not thinking of evil**,\nreturning the light to self-examine—\nsuddenly awakening to clarity.\"*\nThe principles of the **Three Teachings** converge in the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThose who observe **wondrous efficacy** with **desire**—\nat the moment when thought arises and the **mechanism** is about to unfold—\nwithin perception, hearing, awareness, and action,\nwhen **dynamic** and **static** interplay,\none may return to perceive the **spontaneous transformation** and thus awaken and comprehend.\n\n**\"Always without desire\"** means **\"without thought\"**—entering through **principle**;\n**\"always with desire\"** means **\"with thought\"**—entering through **affairs**.\nBoth **\"with thought\"** and **\"without thought\"** emerge from the **Heart**,\nyet their names differ.\n\nBoth are called **the Mysterious**.\nThe **True Heart** is formless—\nto gaze upon it, one sees nothing;\nto listen to it, one hears no sound.\n**The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**—\nutterly empty and luminous, beyond all **intellect** and **discernment**,\ncutting off all **conceptualization** and **reasoning**, with no analogy—\n**True Void, Wondrous Existence**,\nwhere **yin** and **yang** reveal their **wondrous efficacy**,\nand the **Three Powers** are established,\nwhile all things are born.\nThe **Three Bonds** and **Five Constants**,\nlegal

this.\n\nThus it is called the **Gate of All Wonders**.\n\nZhū Bófǔxiù said:\n*\"The **Gate of the Dao/Way**—the **Primordial Origin**.\"*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** itself is **Primordial** and **Nameless**,\nnot to be spoken of.\nWhat may be spoken of is but its **manifestation in the world**.\nThe **Dao/Way** itself is **Ultimate** and **Silent**,\nbeyond all naming.\nWhat may be named is but forced words.\n\nHumans are not born with innate knowledge—\n**principle** must be conveyed through words and teachings.\nThrough **manifestation**, one perceives the **Heart**,\nand through **convenient expedients**, one reveals the **Real**.\nThus, one advances along the **Dao/Way** and returns to its **constancy**,\nascending to **wondrous efficacy**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** resides within all things,\nintermingling without separation—\nthis is **the constant Dao/Way**.\nThe **Dao/Way** disperses as all things,\nand through discriminating all things, names are established—\nthis is **the Dao/Way of differentiation**.\n\nIs **the constant Dao/Way** like the sun’s brilliance at midday?\nThe daylight arises naturally and is boundless.\n\nOr is it like the candle’s radiance?\nThe nightlight is created by humans and is limited.\n\nSimilarly, what may be spoken of or named—\nits meaning is the same.\n\nThe world calls that which does not change **\"the constant\"**,\nyet it does not know that **the ability to change** is also its **constancy**.\n\nThere is no **constancy** without change,\nand no change without **constancy**.\n\nPushing this reasoning to its utmost:\n**\"Great Constancy\"** is **Nameless**—\nthe **constancy of the Dao/Way**, the **constancy of names**,\nnot entangled in **form** or **qi**.\nWhen emptiness reaches its extreme, **spiritual vitality** is born—\nthis is the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nWith **name**, it may be spoken of and named—\nwhen **principles** first emerge and **qi** reveals its **manifestations**,\nthis is the **origin of all things**.\n\nThe **beginning of Heaven and Earth** is the **Dao/Way**,\nand the **origin of all things** is **Heaven and Earth** itself.\n\nIf humans can return to perceive within their own bodies\nthe **beginning of Heaven and Earth**,\nand grasp the **principle of birth and transformation**—\nwhen all illusions are extinguished,\nthe **True Constancy** remains—\nthen both **\"with desire\"** and **\"without desire\"** do not depart from the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**\"With desire\"** refers to the initial sprout of a good thought,\nthe origin of all **affairs** and **principles**.\n**\"Without desire\"** is when the **True Nature** is serene and undisturbed,\n**Heaven’s Principle** surges through unobstructed,\nnot a speck of dust stands—\n**ghosts and spirits** cannot even pry into it.\n\nThe **Dao/Way’s** most refined subtleties—\nwhat else is there to observe?\n\n**\"Manifestation\"** is like an **edge or boundary**,\npointing to the **initial state of the Heart**,\nwhen it is about to interact with all things.\nOne must then return to perceive it\nto **block its source**—\neven good thoughts should not be indulged,\nmuch less those that are not good.\n\n**\"Without desire\"** is **silent** and unmoving,\n**\"with desire\"** is responsive and thus harmonized.\n**Substance** and **function** share one source,\nand the **mechanism** lies in **dynamic** and **static** interplay.\n\nThe **degree** of **dynamic** and **static**—\nthis distinguishes **commoners** from **sages**.\n\n**\"Wondrous efficacy\"** is the **essence of the Dao/Way**,\n**\"manifestation\"** is the **initial state of all things**—\nthe **resources** for **birth and transformation** never stray from daily life.\n**\"Wondrous efficacy\"** is not **utterly absent** yet **vast and empty**;\nfrom **emptiness**, **qi** is transformed—\nwhen there is yet **no form**, it is already present.\n\n**\"Manifestation\"** is not **concrete and pervasive**;\nfrom **stillness**, it moves—\neven the slightest **impulse** can be measured.\nTo delve deeply into this **principle**,\none perceives as if **void** yet suddenly sees a **crow soaring**,\nor **water still** yet suddenly hears a **fish leaping**—\nsuddenly awakening to profound insight,\none opens the **Heaven of the Heart**—\nthe **crow** flies beyond, the **fish** leaps away—\nwhat is seen or heard?\n\nThough **traces** and **sounds** may vanish,\nthe **perceiver** of seeing and hearing never truly vanishes.\nThis is the **secret transmission of the Heart-Seal** from my **Primordial Ancestor of the Supreme Ultimate and Mixed Element**.\n\nIf humans maintain **the constant Heart**,\ninitially observing all worldly thoughts without interruption,\nthey may enter the realm of **\"beyond manifestation\"** and return purely to **\"wondrous efficacy\"**,\nthen what is called **\"desire\"** is but **tortoise hair** and **rabbit horn**.\n\n**\"Manifestation\"** and **\"wondrous efficacy\"** both emerge from the **Dao/Way**,\nyet **principles** have degrees of refinement—\nlike a **spring** issuing from the mountains,\nnourishing and irrigating all—\nits benefits are countless.\nClear and pure, its **True Nature** remains.\nThough **wind** and **sun** may wither it,\nit relies on the **inexhaustible source**.\nAlways observing these two paths,\nthe **source** may be restored.\n\n**\"The Mysterious\"** is the **ultimate principle of the Dao/Way**,\nprofound and subtle, refined and **manifested**.\n\nIf one holds this **perception**,\none is still bound by **dharma**.\nEven **dharma** must be abandoned,\nto truly grasp the **principles of the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**.\n\nAll arise from this—\nthus it is called the **Gate**.\n\nThis **Gate**

**the Unnameable**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is that which, when observed, is unseen,\nwhen listened to, is unheard—\n**the void** yet **naturally** existing.\n\nBefore the **Five Great**,\nbefore **Hongmeng** (the primordial chaos) emerged,\nonly **Mingdang** (the boundless void) and **Daofan** (the great primal),\n**vast and luminousless**,\n**unfathomable**—\nthis is what is called **Taiyi** (the Supreme Unity).\n\n**Taiyi** refers to **the state before qi** existed.\nGradually, it is called **Taichu** (the Primordial Origin).\n**Taichu** refers to the **first stirrings of

Purity).\n**Taixu** refers to **substance** existing yet **unshaped** in form.\n\nGradually, it is called **Taiji** (the Primordial Polarity).\n**Taiji** refers to **form and substance** already complete.\n\nOnce polarity is complete, it divides—\n**light and clear qi** ascends to become **Heaven**,\n**heavy and turbid qi** condenses below to become **Earth**,\n**harmonious central qi** becomes **Humanity**,\nand the **remaining essence** disperses,\ngiving rise to **all things**.\n\nIts **divine functions and wondrous operations** are **boundless and

sound**—\nbefore **Minghuang** (the indistinct) and **Taipu** (the undifferentiated) arose,\nbefore **the great simplicity** became **mixed**,\nit is but **silent and desolate**,\n**only hazy and

exist,\nand then **all things** exist;\n**All things** exist,\nand then **male and female** exist;\n**Male and female** exist,\nand then **husband and wife** exist;\n**Husband and wife** exist,\nand then **lords and ministers** exist;\n**Lords and ministers** exist,\nand then **high and low** exist—\nall derive from **the Nonexistent** before they come into being.\nIf they derive from **the Nonexistent** before they come into being,\nwhat else is it but **the Dao/Way**?\nThus it is said that **the Existent** is the **function/operation** of the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**Mother** is the **Dao/Way**—\nhow so?\n\n*The **Yijing System** says:\n*\"All things under Heaven and Earth are full of it.\"*\n\nTake, for instance, the **roots and stems** that grow and **branches and leaves** that flourish,\n**buds that sprout** and **ears that bear fruit**,\n**wings that fly** and **feet that walk**,\n**scales that leap** and **beaks that peck and cry**,\n**breath that nourishes** and **teeth that bite**—\nin **thousands of forms and ten thousand states**,\nall arise from **the Dao/Way**.\n\nThe common saying goes:\n*\"That which gives birth to me is my parents.\"*\nNow, since it is said that **the Dao/Way** is the **mother of all things**,\nwhat else could it be but **the Dao/Way**?\n\n*The **Scripture of Inner Observation** says:\n*\"The Nonexistent is the mother of the Existent,\nthe Nonexistent is the mother of the Void,\nthe Void is the mother of the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way is the mother of all things.\"*\n\nThus, **the Dao/Way** is **the mother of all things**—\nis this not so?\n\n**The Way’s substance** is **always the Nonexistent** to observe its **miraculous subtlety**.\n**The Always-Nonexistent** is the **Dao/Way’s substance**.\n\nFor the **Great Dao’s substance** is always in **the Nonexistent**,\nwhen in **utterly chaotic void**,\nabove, there is **no high Heaven**,\nno **sun and moon**,\nno **stars, clouds, or mists**,\nno **dew, thunder, or lightning**,\nno **wind or rain**,\nno **frost or snow**—\nonly **dim and boundless**,\n**dark and obscure**.\n\nBelow, there is **no thick Earth**,\nno **mountains or rivers**,\nno **lakes or seas**,\nno **streams or valleys**,\nno **grasses or trees**,\nno **beasts or birds**,\nno **people or nations**—\nonly **silent and murky**,\n**deep and indistinct**.\n\nThus, the **Great Dao’s substance** is **always the Nonexistent**,\nand this is why it is said.\n\n**Miraculous subtlety** is the **Dao/Way’s substance**—\nthis is the explanation given earlier.\n\n**The Always-Nonexistent** means **its still and unmoving nature**.\nYet its **still and unmoving substance** is **profound and unfathomable**,\n**concealed and difficult to perceive**—\nthis is why it is called **the Always-Nonexistent**.\n\nBut this principle is **inherent in all people**,\nonly when **delusive thoughts are suddenly eradicated**,\nand one **sits in silent repose**,\nthe **mind like the Great Void**,\n**without the slightest obstruction**—\nat this moment,\n**the Dao/Way is I**,\n**I am the Dao/Way**.\nIs this not **miraculous subtlety**?\n\nTo observe it means **to probe its concealed depths**.\n\n**The Existent** is **always present** to observe its **boundless operation**.\n**The Always-Existent** is the **function/operation** of the **Dao/Way**—\nit refers to the **mixed and divided**,\n**Heaven and Earth** taking form,\nthe **Three Lights** (*Sān Guāng*) arrayed in the **upper vault**,\nthe **Five Venerable Stars** (*Wǔ Wéi*) traversing their **degrees**,\n**yin and yang** ascending and descending,\n**cold and heat** passing in turn,\n**rain and dew** nourishing,\n**wind and thunder** commanding—\nthe **Five Phases** generating and overcoming,\nthe **Four Seasons** shifting in succession—\neven the **Nine Regions and Eight Directions**,\nthe **Five Lakes and Four Seas**,\n**kings, lords, and vassals**,\n**villages and communities**,\n**grasses, trees, mountains, and rivers**,\n**all classes and myriad things**—\n**constantly filling Heaven and Earth**,\nall arising from the **Dao/Way’s qi** flowing ceaselessly,\nthus it is said that **the Always-Existent** is the **function/operation** of the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**Boundless operation** is the **function/operation** of the **Dao/Way**—\nthis is the explanation given earlier.\n\nThen what is **the Always-Existent**?\nLike **Heaven’s longevity and Earth’s duration**,\nthe **Four Seasons** proceeding,\n**hundreds of things** flourishing—\n**never once failing to fulfill its appointed time**,\nthus it is called **the Always-Existent**.\n\nMoreover, the **human body** is called **a lesser Heaven and Earth**,\nthe **head round** like **Heaven**,\nthe **feet square** like **Earth**,\nthe **eyes** named **sun and moon**,\nthe **hair** as **stars and constellations**,\nthe **Four Seasons and Five Phases**,\n**yin and yang** ascending and descending,\n**plants and forests**—\nall things are complete.\nIf one can observe **the Dao/Way’s substance and function** and act accordingly,\nthen **this body is the Dao/Way**,\n**the Dao/Way is this body**.\n\nThis is the **uttermost profundity of the two** (*liǎng zhě*).\nThe **two**—meaning **boundless operation and miraculous subtlety**—\nboth flow from the **same single Dao/Way**,\nthus distinct names are established to **illustrate its substance and function**,\nand it is said that **they are both called the Profound**.\n\nYet **the Dao/Way’s substance**, though **dim and obscure without form**,\nmust necessarily have **function/operation**—\n**the Nonexistent** is its **substance**,\n**Tai Ji** is its **function/operation**.\n\n**Substance** is **stillness**,\n**function/operation** is **movement**—\nhow so?\n\n**Meng Han** said:\n*\"From the Nonexistent comes Tai Ji,\nTai Ji moves and generates yang,\nmovement reaches its limit and becomes still,\nstillness and it generates yin,\nstillness reaches its limit and moves again,\nmovement reaches its limit and becomes still again—\neach movement and each stillness\nmutually serve as their roots.\nTogether, they are called the Dao/Way.\"*\nThus it is said that **they are both called the Profound**.\n\nThe **gateway to the Profound**—\nthis is the **Supreme Lord’s** praise of the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**The Profound** refers to **the Dao/Way** as an entity,\n**so subtle and miraculous it defies thought**,\nthe **mind is confounded** and cannot know it,\nthe **mouth is stilled** and cannot speak of it—\nexhausting the **waters of the Western River** would not suffice to write its **virtue/power**,\nand **all mouths in the universe** would not suffice to articulate its **profound subtlety**.\n\n**Difficult to discuss and difficult to think**,\n**utterly profound and utterly miraculous**—\nin a single word,\nthus it is called **the Profound of the Profound** (*xuán zhī yòu xuán*).」\n\n「All the myriad wonders—\nthese are the **ten thousand things** (*wànwù*); the **gateway**—\nthis is **principle** (*lǐ*).\n\n**Principle** is the **Dao/Way**.\n\nNow, between heaven and earth,\nevery single thing has its **principle**,\nevery single **principle** has its **gateway**,\nand the **gateway** is the **portal** for entry and exit.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Who can exit without passing through the door?\"*\nThus, **what could be more fitting than this Dao/Way**?\n\nThe world speaks of **eighty-four thousand gateways** (*bā wàn sì qiān mén*),\neach with its own **principle**,\nyet this single **gateway** alone\nencompasses all **principles**,\nnothing is omitted—\nthus it is called the **gateway to all wonders**.\n\nYang Zhìrén said:\n*\"This is the **gateway to the Profound of the Dao/Way**.\"*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is originally nameless,\nbeginning before heaven and earth yet not being their **origin**,\nending after heaven and earth yet not being their **termination**.\nIf it can be named, then it is not the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **constant Dao/Way**—\ndaily life and habitual practice are all the **Dao/Way**,\ndrinking and eating, clothing and shelter,\nsleeping, medicine, and all else—\nthese are all the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**Names**—\nheaven and earth were not originally without names to be called.\nThe ancients said:\n*\"If you name it, it is no longer the **Dao/Way**;\nif it can be named, then it is not the **Dao/Way** itself.\"*\n\n**Names**—\nsuch as **heaven and earth**,\n**sun and moon**,\n**yin and yang**,\n**ten thousand things**,\n**human**,\n**spirit**—\nthese are all called **common names**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** without name at the **beginning** of heaven and earth—\nthis is the **Non-Extreme** (*Wújí*).\nThe **Non-Extreme** moves and gives rise to **yang**,\nis still and gives rise to **yin**,\nthus it is called the **Non-Extreme**,\nthus it is called the **beginning**.\n\nThe **Extreme**—\nthis is the **Supreme Lord** (*Tàijí*).\nIts **forms and manifestations** are fully visible;\nthis is the **Supreme Lord** dividing into **one**,\n**one** generating **two**,\n**two** generating **three**,\nand **three** generating the **ten thousand things**.\n\nHeaven, without **desire** (*yù*), has the **Four Qi** (*sìqì*) clear and bright,\nHumans, without **desire**, are serene and ever at peace—\nthis is the **miracle of returning light** (*fǎn guāng fǎn zhào*) to observe.\n\nIf humans have **desire**,\nthen in their **interactions with circumstances** and **engagements with things**,\nthey must never forget the **returning light** to illuminate—\nthese two are **same in origin yet different in name**.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Within the arising of movement and stillness,*\nthe **profound subtlety** is fully manifested here.\"\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way**—\nit has **sentience** and **character**,\nyet does nothing and takes no form.\nIt can be **transmitted** yet cannot be **received**,\ncan be **obtained** yet cannot be **seen**.\nFrom its **root and origin**,\nbefore heaven and earth existed,\nsince ancient times it has always been so.\n\n**Spirits and deities**, **divine lords and sovereigns**,\ngive birth to heaven and earth,\nexisting before the **Supreme Lord** yet not being **high**,\nexisting beneath the **Six Extremes** yet not being **deep**.\n\nExisting before heaven and earth yet not being **eternal**,\nenduring beyond the **upper antiquity** yet not being **ancient**—\nthough heaven and earth are vast,\ntheir **transformations** are **uniform**;\nthough the **ten thousand things** are many,\ntheir **governance** is **one**;\nthough humans are numerous,\ntheir **master** is the **sovereign** (*jūn*).\n\nThe **sovereign** is **thick with virtue** and **complete in heaven**,\nthus it is called the **profound ancient sovereign** (*Xuángǔ zhī jūn*).\nUnder the **Dao/Way**, the **sovereign** is **without action**—\nthis is the **virtue/power of heaven** alone.\n\nObserving the **Dao/Way** in **governance** clarifies the **sovereign’s rectitude**,\nobserving the **Dao/Way** in **division** makes the **duties of lord and subject** clear,\nobserving the **Dao/Way** in **capacity** brings the **sovereign’s governance** to completion,\nobserving the **Dao/Way** broadly reveals the **response of all things** fully.\n\nThus, what **permeates heaven and earth**—\nthis is **virtue/power** (*dé*).\nWhat **operates among the ten thousand things**—\nthis is the **Dao/Way** (*dào*).\n\nThe *Zhāngyǒng* (*True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*) *Collection of Meanings*—\n**Volume Three** ends.\n**Volume Four**—\n**Master Yōngyuǎn**’s *Observation of the Profound Subtlety of the Constant Dao/Way*.\n\n---\n**Modern annotation (for context, not part of translation):**\n*\"画不操烛者\"* → Likely a scribal error for *\"昼不操烛\"* (*\"by day, not holding torches\"*), a metaphor for natural illumination (corrected as *\"昼\"* in translation).\n\n**Chapter: \"The Dao/Way That Can Be Spoken Of\"**\n\nMaster Liu Weiyong, appointed to oversee and compile,\nFormerly honored as *Grand Secretary* and *Clerk of the Treasury*,\nConcurrently *Editor of the Secretariat*,\nDing Yidong, *Inspector of the Imperial Academy*, verified the text.\n\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of\"*—\nMaster Yucheng said: *\"The gateway to the Dao/Way that can be spoken of.\"*\n\nThe Dao/Way—\nthe complete essence of the *Supreme Ultimate*,\nthe all-encompassing name of ten thousand principles.\nFrom *Hun-Meng*’s primordial division,\nto the settled *Aoxi*’s foundation,\nit was named *Dao/Way* for its strength.\nWhat is called the Dao/Way\nhas never been beyond speech—\nyet its profound subtlety, its ineffable mystery,\nare beyond what ordinary mortals can articulate.\n\nHeaven and earth are but one thing within the Dao/Way;\nwhere there is a thing, there must be a name.\nThat which is light and clear, ascending—\nthis is called *Heaven*;\nthat which is heavy and turbid, descending—\nthis is called *Earth*.\nWhat is manifest and visible—\nthe sun and moon;\nwhat is radiant and patterned—\nthe stars and constellations.\nAll may name them—\nyet why they are light and clear,\nwhy they are heavy and turbid,\nwhy they endure in luminosity without ceasing—\nwhat principle underlies this?\nWho among ordinary folk can name it?\n\nThe Master spoke of *human nature* and the *Dao/Way of Heaven*;\neven Zigong, with his *hearing one thing and knowing two*,\ncould not grasp it—\nhow much less those who fall short of Zigong?\nIf even *hearing* it is impossible,\nhow could one presume to discuss it?\n\nAh! The Master was a Sage—\nZigong merely a common scholar.\nProgram Yi-chuan once pointed to a table and asked Shao Kangzhe:\n*\"Where is this table located?\"*\n*\"Where is Heaven and Earth?\"*\nKangzhe expounded its principle to the utmost,\neven beyond the six directions.\nYi-chuan sighed:\n*\"All my life, only Zhou Moshu has spoken thus.\"*\nKangzhe’s son, Bo-wen, recorded it—\nyet only said *\"he expounded to the utmost\"* without detailing what was said,\nso later scholars could never grasp its essence.\nCould this be what ordinary mortals can speak of,\nwhat ordinary mortals can name?\n\nBefore the *Supreme Ultimate* divided,\nbefore *Yin-Yang*’s indistinctness took form,\nno name had yet been established—\nthus it was called *the Nameless*,\nthe beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n*Beginning*—\nspeaking of its first emergence.\n\nOnce names were established,\nYin and Yang had the names *Yin* and *Yang*,\nthe ten thousand things had their respective names—\nthus all transformations and changes arose from this,\nall myriad branches and tendrils sprang from this.\nHence it was called *the Named*,\nthe *Mother of the Ten Thousand Things*.\n*Mother*—\nthat from which all things derive their birth.\nJust as *Kun* is called *Mother*,\nfor it is the source from which all things draw sustenance.\n\n*\"Constantly without, yet constantly with\"*—\nthis is the punctuation.\n\nThe Dao/Way as a thing is still yet dynamic,\nnot to be found in mere *nothingness*—\nfor then its wonder would not be seen;\nnot to be found in mere *somethingness*—\nfor then its periphery would not be glimpsed.\n*Wonder*—\nthe utmost *profound*, the utmost *essential*,\nthe extreme of subtlety.\n*Periphery*—\nthe borderlands, where the Great Dao’s edge meets lesser paths, called *jiao*.\n*Jiao*—\nalso *return*.\nTo *seek*—\nthis is to *aspire*.\n\nThose who study the Dao/Way well\nconstantly, in *timelessness*, pursue the *supreme ultimate*—\nfor they seek to observe its utmost wonder;\nconstantly, in *timeliness*, pursue the *supreme ultimate*—\nfor they seek to observe its peripheral paths.\n\n*Nothingness* and *somethingness* oppose yet arise together,\nsame source, different names—\nboth are called *profound*.\n*Profound*—\nthe extreme of wonder,\nbeyond speech or description,\nnot merely *profound*, but *profound yet more profound*.\n\nSpanning antiquity and eternity,\nexhausting Heaven and Earth,\nwonderfully manifold yet differing—\nemerging, it emerges;\nentering, it does not enter—\nthis is the *gateway*.\n\nMaster Lin of Yongzhai interpreted this chapter:\n*\"The Dao/Way is originally beyond speech;\nonce speech is applied, all is secondary meaning.\"*\n\n*Constant*—\nunchanging, unalterable.\nWhat can be spoken of, what can be named—\nthis is change, this is alteration;\nwhat cannot be spoken of, what cannot be named—\nthis is no change, no alteration.\nHis reasoning is lofty—\nyet upon close reflection,\nif *\"what can be spoken of\"* is not the *eternal Dao/Way*,\nthen *\"what can be named\"* is not the *eternal Name*—\nthis may conflict with the later phrase *\"the Named, Mother of the Ten Thousand Things.\"*\n\nThe character *Dao* in *\"The Dao/Way\"* is static and weighty;\nthe *Dao/Way* in *\"can be spoken of\"* and *\"constant Dao/Way\"* is dynamic and light—\nthe same for *name*.\nThis chapter opens the *Scripture*—\nLaozi’s grand intent for all who study.\nThose who seek the Dao/Way’s utmost foundation\nmust begin here.\nScholars of the *Scripture* should ponder it deeply.\n\nXu Liu said:\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of—\nthis is not the eternal Dao/Way.\"*\nThe Dao/Way opens to reverence, touching the taboo—\nlike one who does not yet understand\nbut merely hears and draws a snake’s foot.\n\nOriginally, *Hun-Meng* was formless, nameless—\nsince the opening of creation,\nanciently enduring,\nbeyond the grasp of great wisdom,\nbeyond the speech of divine mouths.\nThe Sage knew it in silence,\nyet could not bear for later ages to remain ignorant—\nthus, he named it *Dao/Way* as a metaphor for the formless, the nameless,\nso that it might be accessible,\ntransmitted to later learners.\nHence it was called *Dao/Way*.\nTaking its meaning of *transmission*.\n\nYet even so,\nthis is but its *form*—\nnot yet its *reality*.\nThe *reality* of a single character\nmust be personally verified in sincerity, enlightenment, and self-attainment.\nOnly then does it have true application.\nIf so,\none may endure alongside Heaven and Earth,\nshine alongside the sun and moon.\nOtherwise,\nmerely discussing texts, theories, and words—\nlike the cold speaking of silk brocade,\nthe hungry speaking of feasts—\nthis pleases the ears of the beautiful,\nyet offers no real benefit to the Dao/Way.\nHow could it endure?\n\nThus the *Scripture* says:\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of—\nthis is not the eternal Dao/Way.\"*\nSince what can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way,\nthen the character *Dao* is clarified—\nit is for the seeker to attain it themselves.\n\n*\"The Name that can be named—\nthis is not the eternal Name.\"*\nThe character *Dao* itself\nis but the name for the formless, the nameless.\nIf one does not attain its reality,\nmerely clinging to the *name* that can be named—\nlike the wind, like a sudden rain—\nhow could it endure without ceasing?\n\n*\"The Nameless—\nthe beginning of Heaven and Earth.\"*\nSpeaking of Heaven and Earth’s origin—\ntheir origin lies in the *Nameless*.\n\n「Having a name, the mother of all things.\nSpeaking of the origin of Heaven and Earth’s names,\nall things and events arise from this Dao/Way.\nMother—this is the act of giving birth.\nThese two lines express the sage’s great intent\nto urge people to exhaust principles and perfect their nature.\nAh, human life is one with Heaven and Earth.\nWhat difference is there in the principle of the mother?\nWhy do they not investigate it?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Always without desire, observe its subtlety.*\nThese two sentences, the sage opens\nthe gate of awakening for later generations,\nso that students may explore here\nand surely attain some realization.\nWhy so?\nConstant—this is the eternal Dao/Way.\nWithout desire and with desire,\nthe stillness and motion of the eternal Dao/Way.\nObserve—this is to scrutinize.\nMysterious—this is the profound subtlety.\nSubtlety—this is the return.\nYan Zi said:\n*\"Subtlety is the return of virtue/power.*\nIn tranquil repose, without thought or care,\nthis is the stillness of the eternal Dao/Way.\nHere one can discern the eternal Dao/Way’s\nprofound subtlety in its original essence,\nthus it is said: *‘Always without desire, observe its subtlety.’*\nWith sensation comes understanding;\nresponding to affairs and engaging with things—\nthis is the motion of the eternal Dao/Way.\nHere one can perceive the eternal Dao/Way’s\nadaptive functions and their ultimate return,\nthus it is said: *‘Always with desire, observe its subtlety.’*\nClarifying its essence, comprehending its functions,\nknowing its return—\nthe sage’s learning is complete.\nIf one does not know its return,\nwandering and forgetting the way back—\nthis is the common folk.\nKnowing the essence but not its functions,\nthis is a one-sided scholar.\nNot yet awakened to its essence\nyet able to adorn its functions—\nthis is scholasticism.\nWhen essence and function are both illuminated,\nthrough myriad transformations and changes,\nthe Dao/Way is nowhere absent—\nthis is the highest learning.\nThese two share a common origin yet differ in name.\nThese two, pointing to the prior *having* and *not having*,\nprofound subtlety and return—\ntheir commonality lies in the eternal Dao/Way.\nDiffering in name, yet these two names arise,\nthus it is said: *‘They share an origin yet differ in name.’*\nThe eternal Dao/Way, before its manifestation,\nhas no distinction of *having* or *not having*,\nprofound subtlety or return—\nthis is their commonality.\nOnce manifested, it has the names of *not having* and *profound subtlety/return*—\nthis is their difference.\nThus it is said: *‘They share an origin yet differ in name.’*\nThat which is called *profound* is named so for its depth and distance.\nIf one can know the two’s unmanifested commonality,\nthen their learning is profound and far-reaching indeed.\nProfound—this is depth and distance,\nthus it is said: *‘That which is called profound is named so for its depth and distance.’*\nHe who travels far must reach some destination;\nthough their attainment may be distant,\nif they have not yet reached the ultimate,\nthen their attainment is not yet at its peak.\nThe *profound* again *profound*—\nthe gate of all mysteries.\nAgain *profound*, then their attainment reaches the ultimate,\nand the ultimate is called the *gate of all mysteries*.\nThe *gate of all mysteries*—\nfive thousand profound teachings and boundless subtle meanings,\nall arise from this.\nThe sage opened this gate,\nhoping later students might enter;\nthose who pass through the gate yet do not enter—\nthis is not the intent of the words.\nThose who lean against the gate and debate—\nthis is a common occurrence.\nWhen words reach this point,\none cannot help but laugh and leap,\nunaware of hands dancing, feet stamping.\n\nLi Shifu said:\n*\"The gate of the Dao/Way that can be spoken of—*\nThe Dao/Way exists within the mind,\neveryday and ordinary,\nresponding flexibly to circumstances,\nnowhere absent, at ease and without action—\nthis is the true eternal Dao/Way.\nThose who can separate external false pursuits,\ncalm their minds, and cling to other affairs—\nthis is not the Dao/Way of their ordinary practice.\nThe Dao/Way originally has no name,\nyet from this single *qi* arise Heaven and Earth and all things.\nHaving a name—this is the mother of all things.\nBefore the mind’s inclination arises,\nthere is no knowledge of cleverness or clumsiness,\nyet it produces myriad instruments and assigns them names—\nthis is the mind giving birth to the mother of all things.\n*‘Always without desire, observe its subtlety’*—\nthis is to always have no attachment to desires,\nreturning the light to observe its original nature,\nthe true subtlety.\n*‘Always with desire, observe its return’*—\nthis is to always have desires,\nobserving the paths of seeking life and following return—\nthis is the way of subtlety.\nThese two share an origin yet differ in name—\nwithout desire, entering stillness;\nwith desire, emerging into motion—\nmotion and stillness share the same original source,\nthus they have differing names.\nThat which is called *profound* is named so—\nit is the same as the original mind,\nbefore its manifestation, difficult to measure.\nThe *profound* again *profound*—\nthe minds of common people are unfathomable,\nwhat of the sage’s mind?\nDeep and mysterious in intent,\neven the profound cannot be fully explored.\nThe *gate of all mysteries*—\nall adaptive responses arise from this,\nand its mysteries are boundless.\n\nSu Jingjing said:\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way.*\nThe Dao/Way—this is the Dao/Way of Heaven;\nthe name—this is the name of the Dao/Way.\nIf the Dao/Way of Heaven can be pointed to as the Dao/Way of the world,\nthen it is not the eternal Dao/Way of my ordinary practice;\nif the name of the Dao/Way can be pointed to as the name of the world,\nthen it is not the eternal name of my ordinary usage.\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven is one with nature,\nyet the Dao/Way of the world has distinctions:\nthe Dao/Way of the sovereign, the Dao/Way of the king, the Dao/Way of the tyrant.\nThe name of the Dao/Way is one with clarity and tranquility,\nyet the names of the world have differences:\nbenevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness.\nThe Dao/Way of Laozi is natural,\nand its name is clarity and tranquility—\nthis is indeed different from the Dao/Way and name\nof what the world calls Dao/Way and name.\nLaozi was born in the declining Zhou dynasty,\nwitnessing the Dao/Way of the king already in decline\nand the Dao/Way of the tyrant about to rise.\nHe thought to govern with the natural Dao/Way of Heaven,\nand saw that propriety was the root of thin trustworthiness,\nthe beginning of chaos.\nWhether benevolence or righteousness,\nwhether wisdom or trustworthiness,\nall were in tumultuous confusion.\nHe sought to transform with clarity and tranquility, without action,\nthus there arose the words: *‘The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way.’*\nHis learning was applied by Han Wen and Cao Can,\nachieving the effects of tranquility and the songs of unity.\nThe Western Jin did not apply it well,\nand it led to the calamity of empty debate—\neach follows their own use, that is all.\nThe *Nameless* is the mother of all things.\nThe *Great Polarity* (太极), the *Chaotic Undivided* (浑沦),\nHeaven and Earth—even these have no name,\nis this not the beginning of Heaven and Earth?\nThough Heaven and Earth have not yet come into being,\nthey are already contained within the *Great Polarity*,\nthus it is said: *‘The beginning of Heaven and Earth.’*」\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth first began to differentiate,\nand all things then took on names,\nis this not the mother of all things?\nOnce Heaven and Earth existed,\nall things were born within their embrace—\nthus it is said: *the mother of all things.*\n\nTo observe its subtlety through eternal non-desire.\n\nThe *Great Polarity* spans ancient and modern times,\nwith principle yet no form—\nwithout form, it is the subtle.\n\nThus, one must observe its subtlety through non-being.\n\nHeaven and Earth give birth to all things,\neternally present from ancient to modern times—\nwith being, it is the manifest.\n\nThus, one must observe its manifest through being.\n*Manifest* refers to boundaries.\n\nWhen all things come into being,\none must exhaust their four edges\nto observe their all-encompassing generation.\n\nBeing arises from non-being,\nyet non-being cannot generate being.\nLaozi wrote his book,\nestablishing speech on the two characters *being* and *non-being*,\nfor he saw that the *Yijing*, *Shujing*, *Shijing*, and *Chunqiu*\nall spoke of *being*—\nyet I say *being arises from non-being*,\nand non-being cannot generate being—\nthis is indeed lofty and profound,\nyet it falls into emptiness and nothingness.\n\nYet, when viewed through Laozi’s teachings,\nit is not entirely empty and nothingness.\n\nAs when one does not see what is desired,\nthe heart remains undisturbed;\nas when one rejects cleverness and profit,\nthieves and robbers cease to exist;\nas when one assists the sovereign with the Dao/Way,\nrather than using force to dominate the world;\nas when fine weapons are deemed inauspicious instruments,\nand governance is conducted with rectitude,\nwhile warfare employs stratagem—\nthe more taboos a land has, the poorer its people grow;\nthe more tools of profit proliferate, the more the state grows dim;\nthe more ingenious devices and strange things arise,\nthe more laws are enacted, the more thieves appear;\nas when one acts before things exist,\nand governs before chaos arises;\nas when the people’s hunger stems from excessive taxation by their rulers,\nand their unruliness arises from the rulers’ excessive actions.\n\nAll words conform to principle.\nIndeed, the Master Lao speaks of *wu* (無) yet does not neglect *you* (有), while the *Yijing*, *Shijing*, *Shujing*, and *Chunqiu* speak of *you* yet sometimes overlook *wu*—how can one simply reduce this to the doctrine of *qingjing wuwei*?\n\nThese two are called *xuan* (玄). The two—*you* and *wu*—\nthough they arise from the Dao/Way, bear different names, yet are both called *xuan*.\n*Xuan* is *xuanmiao* (玄妙).\nThough their names differ, both reach the utmost subtlety:\n*Wu* generating *you*—the subtlety of *wu*;\n*You* arising from *wu*—the subtlety of *you*.\nTheir principle is *xuanmiao*, yet both are called *xuan*—\nthus one cannot dismiss *you* entirely.\n*Xuan* again *xuan*, the gateway to all subtleties.\nTo obliterate *you* and *wu* and call it *xuan*—\nthat is not *xuan* at all; it may be called *xuan* again *xuan*.\n\n*Wu* generates *you*, *you* arises from *wu*—\nall virtues under heaven, all subtleties gathered here,\nall spring from this—is it not *xuan* again *xuan*?\n\nWu Huanzhong said:\n*\"The chapter 'The Dao that can be spoken of...'*\nIs the Dao truly a thing?\nI cannot know it.\nIs the Dao truly not a thing?\nI cannot know that either.\nThen what is the Dao?\nIts great origin lies in Heaven—\nHeaven is the Dao itself.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, only the Dao is supreme,\nexisting before all things were born.\nWhen they came to be, then the name *Dao* arose.\nAh, how easily spoken is the Dao!\n\nIn the time of King Zhao of Zhou,\nLaozi composed the *Five Thousand Words on the Dao and Virtue*,\ngrieved by Zhou’s decline, the proliferation of deceit among people,\nand the treacherous paths of the age.\nHe sought to restore the pure ancient ways,\nthus in the first chapter, he first expounded on the pivot of the Dao—\neternal Dao, eternal name,\nthe boundless subtlety of *you* and *wu*,\n*xuan* again *xuan*, the gateway to all subtleties—\nhis meaning hidden yet not revealed,\nhis words seemingly simple yet profound.\n\nFrom the Han to now,\ncommentators number in the hundreds,\neach offering their own views,\ndaring neither to fabricate divergent interpretations\nnor to cite the Classics, histories, or commentaries as proof.\nThey merely delve into Laozi’s text itself,\nlest they err.\n\nThe principles of *renyi* (仁義), *lili* (禮樂), governance, law, warfare,\nfinance, seeking talent, ruling the state, and pacifying the people—\nthese have been thoroughly explained by other schools.\n\nIn broad strokes, *Laozi* teaches one to cultivate and observe\nin the formless and shadowless,\nto act at the moment life and death’s mechanism first stirs—\nyet it is not the same as the Confucian *Dao* of \"no scheming, no self.\"\nPushing both extremes to their limits—\nthis is how it differs from the *Dao* of our scholars.\n\nTruly, as Wen Gong Zhu Ziyang said:\n*\"Within Laozi’s text lies the intent of transcendence—\nmerely seizing one’s own advantage,\npracticing *qingjing wuwei* alone.\"*\nThese words exhaust the meaning of Laozi.\n\nThe Dao that Laozi speaks of\nis not the common Dao of the world.\n\nThe words say: *\"There is a thing that blends into unity,\nborn before Heaven and Earth;\nIt is also said: 'Go to meet it and you do not see its head,\nfollow it and you do not see its back.\nThis is the Dao of Laozi—\nthe Dao that can be spoken of is not the common Dao of the world.\nThe names that Laozi speaks of\nare not the common names of the world,\nthus his words: 'I do not know its name,\nyet I forcefully name it';\nIt is also said: *'See it and you do not perceive,\ncall it *yi* (夷);\nListen to it and you do not hear,\ncall it *xi* (希).\nThis is the naming of Laozi—\nyet it is not the naming of common names.\nThus it continues: 'The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nNeither the common Dao nor the common name,\nbeing and non-being interweaving—\nthe being does not cling to being,\nthe non-being does not fixate on non-being.\nNon-being precedes, being follows not;\nBorn yet not possessed—\nthis is the mother of the Dao.\nThus, from the formless observe the Dao’s subtlety,\nfrom the formed observe the Dao’s limits.\nSubtlety and limits, being and non-being,\nemerge from the same source yet bear different names,\nboth called *xuan* (玄).\n*Xuan* means profound and deep—\nnot derived from color.\nProfound beyond profound,\ndeep beyond measure,\nthe origin of all subtleties.\nThe gate of entry and exit for being and non-being—\nfew attain this gate.\nIts greatness knows no outer bounds,\nits smallness knows no inner void—\ndim and vague within it,\nyet there is an image;\nvague and dim within it,\nyet there is a thing.\nThe Dao is the hidden mystery of all things—\nnone can enter its boundless void,\nhow could it not be the gate of all subtleties?\nIn the first chapter of *Laozi*,\nthe Dao’s pivotal principle is discussed,\nusing the terms *you* (有) and *wu* (无) to penetrate both the common Dao and common names,\nas the essence of the entire book—\nyet it does not fully reveal the Dao,\nonly glimpses appear throughout.\nIt repeatedly reflects and conceals itself,\nuntil Heaven attains *yī* (一) to become clear,\nEarth attains *yī* to become tranquil,\nSpirits attain *yī* to become luminous,\nand the Valley attains *yī* to become full.\nAh! he sighs: *'Yī! Yī!\nIs this not the root and foundation of the Dao?*\nThis *yī*—\nwhen gathered, it is non-being;\nwhen dispersed, it is being.\nZhuang Zhou said: *'When a man attains *yī*, all things are complete.'*\nIndeed, these words are true—\nthe Dao is born from *yī*,\nand one can truly attain this Dao.\nBy perfecting emptiness and steadfastly preserving stillness,\nknowing the strong yet holding to the weak,\nknowing the bright yet holding to the dark,\nfocusing *qi* to attain softness—\none can be like an infant,\nentering and exiting life and death,\npassing through water and fire,\npenetrating metal and stone,\nriding the void and mastering the wind.\nThis is what the world calls *my Dao* as if it were not so,\nand common men hearing it laugh in scorn.\nWu Jun praised: *'None are deeper in the Dao than the Five Thousand Words.'*\nDoes he deceive me?\nChai Yuan Gao said: *'The Dao is without extremity yet is the Great Extremity,\nits essence is void yet its manifestation is real,\nits inner is constrained while its outer is vast.\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the common Dao—\neternal and unchanging,\none true and enduring—\nthis is the constant Dao.\nThe constant Dao is beyond words,\nyet it is not without words—\nit is the speech of the unspeakable.\nThe unspeakable is the essence of the four seasons,\nthe manifestation in all things—\nits essence is birth, its use is action,\nthe birth and action of this very thing\nare the speech of the unspeakable.\nTo truly grasp this principle,\none must quietly contemplate within stillness\nthe lively, unrestrained one—\nonly then will one know the unspeakable sovereign.\nCultivating the Dao,\none takes nature as the body,\nlife as the use—\nnurturing the spirit makes nature luminous,\nnurturing *qi* strengthens life.\nThe spirit is the silent speech within,\nyet cannot speak outwardly—\nit must rely on *qi* to express itself.\n*Qi* is the outward utterance,\nyet it also silently speaks within—\none must forget speech to nurture the spirit.\nThis is the real use of the formless—\nwords cannot convey it,\nthus it is called the Dao that can be spoken of yet is not the common Dao.\nWhen the practice is complete,\nthe Dao that emerges is truly the constant Dao.\n\nThe essence is difficult to name, thus called *miao* (妙).\nThe limits are difficult to name, thus called *jiao* (徼).\n*Jiao* means \"return\" (归).\nThe subtlety of being and non-being—\nboth emerge from the same essence,\nyet their names differ in use.\nThe essence is profound and subtle,\nthe use is also profound and subtle.\nThe gate of all subtleties—\nthis gate is where the *bu* (阖) and *kai* (辟) of Heaven and Earth unfold,\nwhere essence and use intermingle.\nOnly those who observe with no desires\ncan truly grasp this gate.\nThe Master of One-ness said:\n*'The Dao that can be spoken of is the gate of all subtleties.\nThe Dao has no place yet is everywhere—\nif one says it is non-being,\nHeaven, Earth, and all things emerge from it;\nif one says it is being,\nits form and substance cannot be named.\nWhat can be seen is only the constant—\nthe constant has no beginning or end,\nno past or future,\nneither being nor non-being yet encompassing both,\nneither opening nor closing yet moving through all openings and closings.\nTo name the Dao as the Dao that can be spoken of,\nto name the names as the names that can be named—\nhow can this exhaust the constant?\nWhen it is called Dao and also called name,\nthe Dao is hidden while the name is manifest.\nAgain, the name—\nthis is to shape the Dao.\nTo say it is non-being,\nit is not truly non-being—\nonly its name is non-being.\nTo say it is being,\nit is not truly being—\nonly its name is being.\nThus it is said: 'The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nMan’s birth,\ndrawing its beginning from the father and its form from the mother—\nthus Heaven, Earth, and all things\nare fathered by the non-being and mothered by the being.\n*Miao* is the subtlety of the being and non-being;\n*Jiao* is return (归).'*\n\n「The *Liezi* states: The dead are the Dao’s return (归). Zhang Huan’s annotation says that *miao* (徼) is return (归), which is correct. Indeed, before there was any single thing, the principles of all phenomena were already complete. When the myriad things dispersed and took on distinct forms, none failed to return to their original source. Thus, those who embody the Dao must always be without desire to observe its subtlety (妙), and thereby preserve their spirit (神) to resonate and connect with all under Heaven. This understanding is already realized in the stillness of unchanging repose.\n\nThey must also have desire to observe its return (徼), and thereby perceive its cycles, as the constant return to the root and the restoration of vital essence (命) are already evident in the ceaseless interplay of all things. Hence, knowing the subtle and the manifest, one reflects on the vast, grasps the essential to govern all things, and thus the Dao resides within them.\n\nThe Dao’s essence and function are one source, with its subtle and manifest aspects inseparable, so it is said: *“These two [subtlety and return] share a common origin but differ in name.”*\n\n*Xuān* (玄) signifies profound and distant meaning. When called *xuān*, it is said that the Sage and the Dao are as one, encompassing both the refined and the coarse, motion and stillness, transcending being and non-being—so that neither being nor non-being can truly name it. Thus, it is entrusted to *xuān*, as if to say: *“Deep and distant, yet no name can suffice.”*\n\nThis is the great and transforming work of the Dao—*xuān* beyond *xuān*—the unknowable essence of the Sage. In its entering and exiting, its coming and going, what is its proper abode yet remains ineffable? Hence, it is called *“the gateway to all subtleties.”*\n\nIn the Buddhist tradition, the *constant* (常) is called *true constant* (真常), and *subtlety* (妙) is called *wondrous being* (妙有). The interplay of constant, non-constant, and being is the meaning of *emptiness-form* (空色).\n\nWhen called *xuān*, it is that which transcends being and non-being.\n\nThe *Collected Remnants* (*Shíyí*) records: Yan Junping said: *“The Named is not the Dao. The Nameless is not the Dao. The Constructed is not the Dao. The Unconstructed is not the Dao. That which is Nameless yet names all things, that which is Unconstructed yet constructs all things—*\nthis is the Dao. The Sage of the Great Peace (太平光师) said: *“When there is opposition, it is duality (客异); when all distinctions are severed, it is the profound unity (玄同). To forget the profound unity itself is to call it *profound-profound* (玄玄).”*\nBing Wen states: *“This chapter illuminates the ultimate essence of the *Double Profound* (重玄), not merely that the Dao which can be spoken of is not the Dao, nor that the Dao which cannot be spoken of is not the Dao. In the *Zhuangzi*, both speech and silence are insufficient to exhaust the Dao. Not only is the Dao always nameless, but even the interplay of named and nameless cannot exhaust the Dao.*\n\n*The Unnamed is the semblance of the Dao. Since both having and non-being cannot exhaust the Dao, it is again entrusted to the *Double Profound* (重玄).”*\n\nThe *Cross-Referencing of the Masters* and *Guan Yinzi* state:\n*“There is no Dao that can be spoken of; what cannot be spoken of is the Dao.\nThere is no Dao that can be thought of; what cannot be thought of is the Dao.\nHeaven’s flow is unrestrained (怒流), human affairs are intricate (错错然)—*\nlike the flickering of shadows (若若乎回), like the clashing of nations (戛戛乎国), like the fleeting of semblances (勿勿乎似而非), yet people debate it, cling to it, reject it, praise it, abandon it, or grasp at it. To speak of it is like chasing after a shadow; to think of it is like probing dust. The Sage’s wisdom creates confusion, and even spirits do not recognize it. Only that which cannot be done, cannot be attained, cannot be measured, and cannot be divided is called Heaven, called Vital Essence (命), called Spirit (神), called Profound (玄), and collectively called the Dao.\n\nThere is not a single thing that is not Heaven, not a single thing that is not Vital Essence (命), not a single thing that is not Spirit (神), not a single thing that is not Profound (玄). If things are such, how can humans be otherwise? Everyone can be called Heaven, everyone can be called Spirit (神), everyone can be said to attain Vital Essence (命) and penetrate the Profound (玄). Yet one cannot say this thing is Heaven and that is not, this is Spirit and that is not, this is Vital Essence and that is not, this is Profound and that is not.\n\nThus, those who excel in the Dao understand that within a single thing, Heaven is complete, Spirit is exhausted, Vital Essence is attained, and the Profound is realized. In studying it, one follows the varied names, analyzing them to find their shared reality. In attaining it, one aligns with the unity, forgetting the varied names.”*\n\nChen Baoyi’s interpretation states:\n*“The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Scholars of the world rarely see the *Guan Yinzi*, yet they often interpret the Dao through the words of a hundred schools and their own conjectures, making them ever more unable to clarify Laozi’s intent.*\n\n*The *Guan Yinzi* says:\nIf there were a Dao that could not be spoken of, then the Dao and speech would be two. Only when what cannot be spoken of is the Dao do speech and the Dao become one. Yet scholars, upon seeing ‘there is no Dao that can be spoken of,’ often mistakenly believe there is a Dao that *can* be spoken of. If there were a Dao that could be spoken of, it should be said ‘there is a Dao that is not unspeakable,’ not ‘there is no Dao that can be spoken of.’\n\nNow, when it is said: ‘There is no Dao that can be spoken of; what cannot be spoken of is the Dao,’ it is reversing Laozi’s words to clarify his deeper meaning. When reversed, it reads: ‘There is no Dao that cannot be spoken of; what cannot be spoken of is the Dao.’ Once it is reversed to say ‘what cannot be spoken of is the Dao,’ then it is reversed again to say ‘the Dao that can be spoken of is not the Dao.’ This is Laozi’s statement that the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\n\nSome still doubt whether ‘can be spoken of’ refers to the Dao of speech. I further reverse the scripture’s words to enlighten them, saying: As when one says ‘emptiness can be emptied, yet it is not true emptiness’—if it can be emptied, then there are things. Where it is blocked yet not emptied, how can it be called true emptiness? Knowing that emptiness can be emptied is not true emptiness, then one knows that the Dao which can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\n\nOthers may illustrate it thus: ‘Like the heart, the heart is like nature (性); nature can all be cultivated through effort.’ If the Dao were something humans could construct, why then cannot the Dao be spoken of as the Dao? Without reversing the meaning beyond words, I would never have been able to clarify Laozi’s scriptural intent in my lifetime.\n\nPeople of the world are also often misled by the word *constant* (常), thinking Laozi speaks of a Dao beyond the constant. Yet Laozi established this word *constant* precisely to prevent such doubt—that my Dao differs from that of others. They do not realize that this is the universal Dao of all under Heaven. Even the Dao named as Dao is the universal name of all under Heaven.\n\nThis Dao penetrates Heaven and Earth, spans the ancient and the present, without a place it does not inhabit. The moment one opens their mouth to speak of it, they are far removed from the Dao. Hence, it is said to be *two* (二).」\n\nThe moment one declares this arbitrarily named *name* as a name that can be named, then it is no longer a name. Only because it cannot be named does one use the conventional name to name it arbitrarily—just as one says, \"It is not a name that can be named, yet the inability to name it *is* the name.\"\n\nThus, what cannot be spoken of *is* the Dao; what cannot be named *is* the name. This is Laozi’s meaning: that which can be spoken of is not the constant Dao, and that which can be named is not the constant name.\n\nYet Laozi was a great sage—his words like Heaven’s unspeakable speech. Were it not for a sage like Guan Yinzi, who could have further illuminated the meaning beyond the words through unspeakable speech?\n\nBut Guan Yinzi, having already illuminated the meaning of what cannot be named or spoken, feared that people might think: if the Dao cannot be named or spoken, then it can be attained through thought. Hence, he further said: \"It is not that the Dao cannot be thought, but that which cannot be thought *is* the Dao\"—the same intent as before.\n\nAh! What can be spoken of and thought about are human affairs; what cannot be spoken of or thought about are Heavenly matters. Then how do people and Heaven truly differ in appearance?\n\nOne might say: all people can be called Heaven.\n\nYet can people and Heaven truly be observed as the same?\n\nOne might say: Heaven’s phenomena rage like flowing waters, while human affairs are tangled and chaotic—some resemble each other yet turn away, some clash and contend, some seem alike yet are not. Some contend daily with their minds, some remain aloof without engaging, some scold and shout, some murmur and call, some depart and separate, some seek and unite. Heaven’s phenomena and human affairs differ thus—how can they be observed as the same?\n\nNow if one attempts to grasp the Dao through human speech and thought, it is like blowing at shadows or carving dust—only exhausting the mind in vain.\n\nThis Dao: even sages and wise ones, when crafting it, remain bewildered; even spirits and gods, when probing it, do not recognize it. Only because it cannot be made, it is called *Heaven*; because it cannot be attained, it is called *Fate*; because it cannot be measured, it is called *Spirit*; because it cannot be divided, it is called *Mysterious*.\n\nCombining these four, one arbitrarily names it *Dao*.\n\nLaozi spoke of the Dao, following it with *constant* and *without desire* to observe its subtlety, *constant* and *with desire* to observe its peril—both called *Mysterious*. Mysterious beyond mysterious, the gateway to all subtleties.\n\nGuan Yinzi feared that scholars would cling to differing names, dissecting the same reality, and thus observe Heaven, Fate, Spirit, and the Mysterious as separate. Hence, in this passage, he reiterates: within a single thing, one can know Heaven, exhaust Spirit, attain Fate, and craft the Mysterious.\n\nAll things are thus; all people inherently possess this. It cannot be that this is Heaven and that is not, this is Spirit and that is not, this is Fate and that is not, this is Mysterious and that is not.\n\nThus, some call it *subtle*, some call it *perilous*, some call it *Mysterious*—yet all things are thus, and all people inherently possess it. Only those who grasp it recognize its unity, forgetting its differences, and call it by name.\n\nAs for *Mysterious beyond mysterious*, one may enter the Dao.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"There is a beginning, there is what has no beginning yet has a beginning, there is what has no beginning to what has no beginning yet has a beginning, there is what has existence, there is what has non-existence, there is what has no beginning to non-existence, there is what has no beginning to what has no beginning to non-existence. Suddenly, there is non-existence. Yet who knows whether this non-existence is truly non-existent or truly existent?\"*\n\nNow, I have already spoken of it, yet I do not know whether my words truly have meaning or truly lack meaning.\n\nWith the original as refined, with things as coarse, with accumulation as insufficiency, serene and alone, dwelling with Spirit and Clarity.\n\nIn ancient Daoist arts, there was one such as this. Guan Yinzi and Lao Dan heard of its essence and took delight in it, establishing it with *constant non-being*, governing it with *Great Unity*, using *softness, weakness, humility, and lowliness* as its outward form, and *emptiness, voidness, and non-destruction of all things* as its substance.\n\nWenzi said:\n*\"What gives rise to affairs responds to changes and moves accordingly. Change is governed by time, and its actions are without constancy.\"*\n\nThus, the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao, and the name that can be named is not the constant name.\n\nBooks are born from speech. Speech arises from the wise who do not know—this is the non-constant Dao. What can be named is not the act of preserving books.\n\nIn ancient times, those with unbound hair and no collar ruled under Heaven. Their virtue was born without killing, gave without taking, and all under Heaven, though empty, cherished their virtue.\n\nAt that time, yin and yang were harmonious, and all things flourished. Birds’ nests could be reached by leaning down, and wild beasts could be tethered and followed.\n\nWhen it declined, birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became human hazards. Thus, iron was cast and blades were forged to defend against them.\n\nWhen people were pressed by these hazards, they sought convenience; when plagued by troubles, they prepared defenses. Each used their wisdom to avoid what harmed them and pursue what benefited them.\n\nSince constancy cannot be followed, and tools cannot be relied upon, the laws of the ancient kings had variations.\n\nThus, it is said: what can be named is not the constant name.\n\nThe Five Constants differ in Dao yet cover all under Heaven; the Three Kings varied in affairs yet their names endure in posterity.\n\nThey adapted to the times and changed accordingly.\n\nFor instance, the music master’s tuning of the five tones shifts up and down without fixed measurements, yet never misses the mark.\n\nThus, those attuned to the emotions of music can compose sounds with roots, centered in harmony. Those who understand the uses of compasses, squares, hooks, and cords can govern people. Hence, the ancient kings’ distinctions, though not rigidly enforced, were followed in the later ages. Thus, sages established rites and music without being bound by law.\n\nHence, it is said: the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\n\nTo alleviate poverty and relieve urgency brings forth names of profit and harm, removes accumulated ills, and achieves success. When the world has no disasters, even sages have no virtue to apply, and when all are harmonious, even the virtuous have no deeds to establish.\n\nThus, the governance of the perfected sage embraces virtue, holds to the Dao, extends sincerity, and applies boundless wisdom—resting in speechlessness, unknown to the world. Their speechlessness is honored, hence the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao, and the name that can be named is not the constant name.\n\nWhat is inscribed upon bamboo and silk, carved upon metal and stone, and thus transmitted to humanity—these are but its superficial traces.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the Three Kings, though their deeds differed, shared a singular intent; though their paths diverged, their ultimate aim was one.\n\nScholars of the later ages, failing to grasp the essence of the Dao or the unity of virtue, seek only to advance their own achievements. Kneeling or seated, they speak of it, though their vast learning and wide hearing only lead them further into confusion.\n\nStone Tan said: *\"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\"* This passage has two divergent interpretations.\n\nSome take the opening *\"The Dao that can be spoken of\"* as the Dao that can be attained through speech, while *\"the constant Dao\"* refers to that which cannot be spoken. Others interpret *\"The Dao that can be spoken of\"* as the Dao spoken of by Laozi, and *\"the constant Dao\"* as the Dao spoken of by ordinary people.\n\nYet if the first *\"Dao\"* is taken as the Dao that can be spoken of, then Laozi would invert the world’s conception of Dao by placing it at the beginning of his text, making this *\"Dao\"* not his own. Would Laozi name his work *\"Dao\"* only to immediately speak of the world’s Dao?\n\nIf instead the first *\"Dao\"* is Laozi’s own Dao—meaning *\"My Dao is not the Dao of the common people\"*—this also holds some plausibility. Yet then *\"the constant Dao\"* would refer to the Dao of the common people, as in Confucius An Guo’s *\"Book Sequence\"* where *\"the constant Dao\"* is mentioned.\n\nBut the next chapter speaks of *\"knowing the constant as clarity,\"* and this chapter itself contains *\"constantly without desire to observe its subtlety, constantly with desire to observe its peril.\"* Would *\"constant\"* here mean merely the ordinary?\n\nBoth interpretations seem flawed. After careful reconsideration, it appears that both the opening *\"Dao\"* and the subsequent *\"constant Dao\"* refer to the essence of the Dao itself. The *\"Dao that can be spoken of\"* is the Dao as commonly understood by people. If one says, *\"My Dao is not the Dao that can be pointed to by the world,\"* then the Dao that can be named is not the Dao of natural constancy that I speak of.\n\nThe *\"constant\"* refers to that which is ever-present in all things, unchanging through time, eternally enduring from antiquity to the present. The Dao as commonly spoken of—what Confucius called *\"the lesser Dao\"* and Mencius *\"the divided Dao\"*—is the Dao of daily practice and common conduct. But Laozi’s Dao is the singular, void, and natural principle itself.\n\n*\"The name that can be named is not the constant name.\"* This passage also has two interpretations.\n\nSome take the opening *\"name\"* as the name of the common world, while others take it as the name of the Dao. The distinction in meaning mirrors that of the previous passage.\n\nFollowing the earlier pattern, the opening *\"name\"* and the subsequent *\"constant name\"* both refer to the naming of the Dao. The Dao itself cannot truly be named, yet we designate it as *\"Dao\"* by force of convention. If it could be named, then its names would be relative—such as the *\"beautiful and ugly, difficult and easy, long and short, high and low\"* mentioned in the next chapter—which cannot be considered the *\"constant name.\"* Thus, these two sentences serve only to elucidate the previous two, explaining the later chapter’s assertion that the Dao is forcibly named.\n\n*\"Nameless, the origin of heaven and earth. Named, the mother of ten thousand things.\"* This passage also has two interpretations.\n\nSome punctuate it as *\"Nameless, named,\"* while others as *\"Without, with.\"* The latter seems more elevated. Yet the next chapter speaks of *\"the Dao constantly without name at its origin, then named in its manifestation,\"* so perhaps this too could be punctuated thus.\n\nThose who punctuate *\"Nameless, named\"* are correct. The essence of the Great Dao is boundless and formless, yet all phenomena are already manifest within it. Because it is boundless and formless, it cannot be named, hence *\"Nameless.\"* Though nameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth. Because all phenomena are already present, their principles can be named, hence *\"Named.\"* Once named, it becomes the mother of all things.\n\n*\"Origin\"* refers to its source—being generated from the void, hence *\"origin.\"* *\"Mother\"* refers to its latent presence, like an embryo already formed, hence *\"mother.\"* This *\"origin\"* is akin to the *\"Great Origin\"* in the *Yijing*, and *\"mother\"* is akin to the *\"completion of things.\"* But the *Yijing* speaks primarily of Heaven and Earth, while this text focuses solely on the Dao.\n\n*\"Constantly without desire, one observes its subtlety; constantly with desire, one observes its peril.\"* This passage also has two interpretations.\n\nSome punctuate it at *\"without\"* and *\"with,\"* following Zhuangzi. Indeed, the *\"Heaven and Earth\"* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* speaks of *\"establishing it with constant non-being,\"* directly echoing this passage’s *\"constant without, constant with.\"* Yet the later chapter of the *Laozi* itself contains the phrase *\"constant without desire,\"* making it unlikely to punctuate at *\"without.\"*\n\nPunctuating at *\"desire\"* conflicts with the *Zhuangzi*, while punctuating at *\"without\"* conflicts with the later chapter. Yet the *Zhuangzi* most faithfully captures the *Laozi’s* essence—could the *\"without desire\"* in the later chapter be a mere coincidence, not to be taken as precedent?\n\nSince both interpretations have merit, neither should be discarded. Punctuating at *\"without\"* and *\"with\"* speaks to the nature of the Dao itself; speaking of *\"constant without desire\"* and *\"constant with desire\"* addresses how humanity embodies the Dao.\n\nThe constant Dao is hidden in the void, hence its subtlety can be observed there; the constant Dao manifests in the having, hence its perils can be observed there.\n\nThe subtlety refers to that which cannot be named; the perils refer to that which has names.\n\nIf one punctuates at *\"desire\"*, then humanity’s ability to remain without desire reveals the Dao’s constant subtlety—this is akin to what the *Great Classic of Change* calls *\"tranquil and motionless\"*. The Dao’s constant perils appear where desire exists—this is akin to what the *Great Classic of Change* calls *\"stirred and thus responsive\"*.\n\nTo perceive the Dao’s constant subtlety in the absence of desire and its constant perils in the presence of desire is to grasp the Dao’s essence and function.\n\nThese two are of the same origin yet bear different names, both called *Xuan* (玄).\nThis is the Confucian teaching of *\"essence and function are one source, manifest and subtle without separation\"*.\n\nThe two—having and non-having—\nthe Dao takes non-having as its essence, having as its function.\nBoth arise from the Dao, hence called *\"one source\"*.\nYet having and non-having are distinct names:\nnon-having is the subtle,\nhaving is the manifest,\nand only because of their shared source are they without separation.\n\nNow, what is called *Xuan* (玄)?\nIt is neither having nor non-having,\nyet it is not as if one can say it is non-having—\nthen its function would seem to be having.\nHence it is called *Xuan*.\n*Xuan* means that having and non-having cannot be divided.\n\n*Xuan* beyond *Xuan*—\nthe gate through which all subtleties pass.\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"There are those who speak of having-having,\nthose who speak of having-non-having,\nthose who speak of neither having nor non-having,\nand those who speak of neither having nor non-having yet also not of having that which is neither having nor non-having.\"*\n\nThat which can be named is Zhuangzi’s *\"having-having\"*;\nthat which cannot be named is Zhuangzi’s *\"having-non-having\"*,\nwhile *Xuan* is neither having nor non-having—\nyet if one says it is non-having,\nthen it is *\"neither having nor non-having\"*,\nand if it is *Xuan* beyond *Xuan*,\nthen it is *\"neither having nor non-having yet also not of having that which is neither having nor non-having\"*.\n\n*Xuan* cannot be spoken of as having or non-having,\nand *Xuan* beyond *Xuan* cannot be spoken of even as *Xuan*—\nthough *Xuan* beyond *Xuan* it is,\nwithin the single principle are myriad principles contained,\nand the subtleties of all principles emerge from this,\nhence it is called the *gate*.\n\nNow, to have one principle give rise to myriad principles—\nthis seems akin to the Confucian Dao.\nYet it ultimately differs from the Confucian Dao,\nfor the Confucian school takes concrete things as primary,\nand the Dao is found within them,\nwhile this takes emptiness and non-being as primary,\nand focuses solely on the Dao’s essence,\ntranscending the coarse nature of concrete things.\n\n**End of Volume Four of *Collected Meanings of the True Classic of the Dao and Virtue****\n**Start of Volume Five of *Collected Meanings of the True Classic of the Dao and Virtue***\n\n**Volume Five of *Collected Meanings of the True Classic of the Dao and Virtue***\n\nMaster Yǒngyuǎn’s profound and subtle exposition of the Dao’s vast virtue,\nwith Sī Wéiyǒng’s compilation of observations,\nand Dīng Yìdōng’s annotations—\na former imperial scholar and editor of the Secretariat Bureau,\nwith variant readings noted.\n\n**Chapter: \"All Under Heaven Know\" (天下皆知章)**\n\n**Variant Readings:**\n- *Héshànggōng* composed *The Chapter on Nourishing the Body* (《养身章》),\n- Zhào Shí’ān composed *The Chapter on the True and Eternal Integration of Principles* (《真常融摄义章》).\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**\nThe preceding chapter illuminated the wondrous origin of transformation,\ndistinguishing the twofold observation [of Dao].\nThis chapter elucidates the undifferentiated and scattered names of *Pu* (the Uncarved),\narising from myriad distinctions—\nas distinctions arise, so does wandering,\nbut virtuous transformation returns to the root.\n\nThus, it first marks the entanglement of beauty, goodness, and delusion,\nthen demonstrates the interplay of presence and absence,\nand concludes with the Sage’s principle,\nhoping to swiftly restore the pure and unadulterated.\n\n**Dù Guāngtíng’s Explanation:**\nThe vast and boundless currents of existence,\nthe sluggish multitude of living beings—\nentering realms, emotions stir;\nthe farther from the Dao, the more distant they stray.\nThe Sage pities their forgetfulness and opens this wondrous gate.\n\nThe twofold observation of the previous chapter\nentered from non-being into being.\nThis chapter marks the sixfold delusions,\nwhereby affairs sway the mind.\nIf one knows the error of following realms\nand does not succumb to wandering transformations,\nthen one may speak of the gradual cultivation of an empty heart and full belly.\n\n**Zhāng Chōngyìng’s Interpretation:**\nThe Dao precedes the body yet encompasses heaven and earth.\nIf one aligns with this natural Dao in action,\nthe spirit is preserved, the essence fortified—\ndo not chase after things,\ndo not flaunt one’s talents,\ndo not crave fame;\nfear gain as one seeks loss,\napproach the near while dreading the far—\nthen all calamities fade unseen,\nand the body finds its nourishment.\nThus, *Nourishing the Body* follows the chapter on embodying the Dao—\nthis is *Héshànggōng*’s exposition.\n\n---\n**All under heaven know beauty as beauty—**\nthen ugliness arises.\nAll under heaven know goodness as goodness—\nthen wickedness arises.\nThus, presence and absence give rise to each other,\ndifficulty and ease complete one another,\nlength and shortness define each other,\nhigh and low contrast each other,\nsounds harmonize with each other,\nbefore and after follow each other.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in non-action,\nteaches without speech—\nall things arise yet he does not claim them,\ngives birth yet does not possess,\nacts yet does not rely upon it,\nand when the deed is done, does not dwell upon it.\n**Only by not dwelling does it not depart.**\n\n**Variant Readings:**\n- \"Presence and absence follow each other closely\" (有无至相随) alternates with:\n  *\"Presence and absence give rise to each other, difficulty and ease complete each other...\"*\n- \"All things arise yet he does not claim them\" (万物作焉而不辞) alternates with:\n  *\"All things arise yet he does not initiate\"* (万物作焉而不为始).\n- \"Does not dwell upon it\" (弗居) alternates with:\n  *\"Does not\"* (不) or omits the *\"while\"* (而) entirely.\n- \"Thus it does not depart\" (是以不去) alternates with *\"Thus it does not abide\"* (不处).\n\n**Héshànggōng’s Explanation:**\nAll under heaven know beauty as beauty—\nthis is to boast of one’s own excellence.\nThen ugliness arises—\nthere is peril and ruin.\nAll under heaven know goodness as goodness—\nthis is to seek fame and merit.\nThen wickedness arises—\nit becomes what others contend for.\n\nThus, presence and absence give rise to each other—\nseeing presence as absence.\nDifficulty and ease complete each other—\nseeing difficulty as ease.\nLength and shortness define each other—\nseeing shortness as length.\nHigh and low contrast each other—\nseeing height as low.\nSounds harmonize—\nwhen one sings, the other must respond.\nBefore and after follow—\nwhen one advances, the other must incline.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in non-action—\ngoverning through the Dao.\nTeaches without speech—\nleading by personal example.\nAll things arise—\neach moves spontaneously.\nYet he does not refuse—\nhe does not reject or obstruct.\nGives birth yet does not possess—\nthe Original Qi generates all things yet does not claim them.\nActs yet does not rely upon it—\nthe Dao’s work is done without expectation of reward.\nWhen the deed is complete, he does not dwell upon it—\nwhen the work is done, he withdraws, not claiming the position.\n**Only by not dwelling does it not depart—**\nonly by not claiming the deed does the blessing remain,\nand it does not abandon the body.\n\nThis shows that what is not done cannot be followed,\nand what is not spoken cannot be known.\n\nThe first six lines speak of high and low, long and short—\nthe Sage opens one source,\nfrom which a hundred branches arise.\nThe transformations of these branches\nare without fail in motion and disorder.\n\n**Wáng Fǔsì’s Commentary:**\nAll under heaven know beauty as beauty—\nbeauty is what the heart delights in.\nUgliness is what the heart abhors.\nBeauty and ugliness are like joy and anger,\ngoodness and wickedness are like right and wrong—\njoy and anger share the same root,\nright and wrong share the same gate.\nThus, they cannot be partially discarded.\n\nThese six are all natural, self-evident truths—\ntherefore, the Sage’s affairs are complete in their naturalness;\nif forced, they fail.\nFrom *\"teaches without speech\"* to *\"does not rely upon it\"*—\nwisdom is inherently complete;\nif forced, it becomes false.\n*\"When the deed is complete, he does not dwell upon it\"*—\nacting in accordance with things,\nthe deed completes itself;\nthus, he does not dwell upon it.\n**Only by not dwelling does it not depart—**\nif the deed is attributed to oneself,\nthe deed cannot endure.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**\nAll under heaven know beauty as beauty—\nbeauty and goodness arise from desire.\nWhere the heart desires,\neven ugliness becomes beautiful and good.\nThus, it is said:\n*\"All under heaven know what they themselves deem beautiful as beauty,\nand what they themselves deem good as good.\"*\nBeauty and goodness have no inherent master—\nthey are merely deluded emotions.\nThis arises from clinging to presence or absence,\ndistinguishing difficulty and ease,\ndiscerning the marvelous from the vile—\nall swaying and contending.\nThe great Sage weighs these carefully,\nknowing their emptiness and delusion,\nthus declaring: *\"Then ugliness arises.\"*\n\n**Commentary:**\n*\"All under heaven\"*—\nspeaking of the general populace beneath heaven’s canopy.\n*\"Beauty\"*—what the heart finds pleasing.\n*\"Goodness\"*—what the body practices.\nIt is said that all under heaven know what their own hearts find pleasing as beauty,\nand what their own bodies practice as goodness.\nThus, in matters of taste, they shun the bitter,\npreferring the red;\nin matters of virtue, they reject the plain,\nfavoring the ornate—\nmutually swaying, they inevitably stir contention,\nall arising from the stirring of desire.\nThus, beauty and ugliness emerge in succession.\nThe Sage knows beauty and ugliness have no inherent nature—\nthey are merely deluded emotions.\nDelusion is not constant,\nhence it is said: *\"Then ugliness arises.\"*\n\n「已， merely a verbal particle for emphasis.\n\n注云 *\"Godly wonders and putrid decay\"*—\nZhuangzi states: *\"What is deemed beautiful is godly wonders, what is deemed ugly is putrid decay\"*—this is precisely it.\nThus, the arising of being and non-being is relative.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of being and non-being’s inherent nature.\nNon-being does not exist inherently—it arises from being.\nThe common folk thus assert that being generates non-being.\nBeing does not exist inherently—it arises from non-being.\nThe common folk thus assert that non-being generates being.\nHence, it is said *\"they arise in relation\"*—\nthough being and non-being are not inherently dependent,\nthe names of *\"relative generation\"* stem from deluded perception,\njust as beauty and ugliness are not inherently produced—\nall are empty.\nThus, the Sage seeks to investigate this deluded entanglement,\nand so proceeds to enumerate the sixfold illusions:\nDifficulty and ease arise in relation.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of difficulty and ease’s inherent nature.\nBecause of difficulty, ease arises;\nbecause of ease, difficulty arises.\nIt is like the artisan who finds his craft easy in shaping but difficult in firing,\nor the potter who finds his kiln easy to manage but wood difficult to work.\nHence, it is said *\"difficulty and ease arise in relation.\"*\nIf one aligns with what is difficult, then ease does not exist;\nif one aligns with what is easy, then difficulty does not exist.\nDifficulty and ease are without substance—\ntheir names arise from false perception.\nThus, those who comprehend them abandon both skill and clumsiness,\nand the names of difficulty and ease cease.\nSimilarly, beauty and ugliness are without fixed nature.\n\nLength and shortness arise in contrast.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of length and shortness’s inherent nature.\nBecause of length, shortness appears;\nbecause of shortness, length appears—\nhence *\"length and shortness arise in contrast.\"*\nThe duck’s legs are not short,\nyet when compared to the crane’s length, they seem so—\nthus, to extend them causes sorrow.\nThe crane’s legs are not long,\nyet when compared to the duck’s shortness, they seem so—\nthus, to shorten them causes grief.\nSeeing length and shortness arise in contrast,\nit is like beauty and ugliness—\nwithout fixed substance,\nall are falsely perceived.\nSince their forms are empty, their names are also empty—\nhence, they are left undefined.\n\nHigh and low arise in mutual dependence.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of the names *\"high\"* and *\"low.\"*\nThe names *\"high\"* and *\"low\"* mutually depend,\nhence one speaks of *\"high\"* only in relation to *\"low,\"*\nand one speaks of *\"low\"* only in relation to *\"high.\"*\nAgain, when one deems something *\"high,\"*\nit is not truly high—\nwhen one deems something *\"low,\"*\nit is not truly low.\nLike the ministers and subjects of past dynasties,\nwho constantly shift in status,\nthese names are also without fixed nature—\nhence, no fixed position.\n\nSounds and voices arise in harmony.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of *\"harmony\"* and *\"union.\"*\nWhen the five tones harmonize to form a melody,\nwho unifies all the voices?\nThen one can measure the song—\nas with the laws of past dynasties,\nall harmonize and unite,\nyet their essence is not truly real—\nall are empty.\nThus, when the Sage seeks to establish beauty and ugliness,\nhow could he speak of such profound observation?\n\nPast and future arise in succession.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of the three times.\nDay and night succeed each other—\nthe new arises from the old.\nWho, when casting a footstep, determines *\"past\"* and *\"future\"*?\nThe names *\"past\"* and *\"future\"* arise from their succession.\nSince names arise from false perception,\nand one deceives oneself in recognizing their essence,\nthe three times—past, present, and future—are empty.\nThus, they constantly change and transform,\njust as beauty and ugliness have no fixed names.\n\nThe six arise in opposition,\nsequentially generating names—\njust as beauty and ugliness,\nwhich are not inherently produced,\nstem from deluded emotions,\nleading to such manifold confusions.\nThus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching.\n\n*\"Non-action\"*—\nthis is the teaching of non-action.\nIt is metaphorically called *\"action\"*—\nhence, *\"abiding in the teaching of non-speech\"*—\nthis is the forgetting of speech.\nIt is metaphorically called *\"teaching\"*—\nhence, *\"practicing\"*—\n\n**Commentary:**\n*\"Thus\"*—\nthis explains the lower to clarify the upper.\nThough the adorned and deceitful may remain silent,\nthey are not practicing non-action;\nthough the natural and simple may give constant orders,\nthey remain unperturbed.\nThus, the Sage knows all dharmas are of empty nature—\nwithout arrogance or attachment,\none governs the world by rejecting pretenses,\nemploying pure virtue.\nThe people transform accordingly,\neach content in their allotted place.\nContentment in one’s place brings no disturbance—\nis this not the matter of non-action?\nWords issue from oneself,\nall based on the world’s hearts—\nthus, though speaking all day, one has never truly spoken—\nis this not the teaching of non-speech?\nAll things act naturally without complaint.\nThe Sage allows all things to follow their own movements,\nyet they do not thank or reproach the Sage.\n\n**Commentary:**\n*\"Act\"* means movement—\n*\"complaint\"* means gratitude or reproach.\nThe Sage’s good governance is without action or effort,\nyet the people, unaware, rejoice and are content,\neach following their own movements,\nwithout thanking or reproaching the Sage.\nThus, they strike the earth and drum their bellies,\nforgetting the Emperor’s power—\nthe people forget the Sage’s deeds.\n\n*\"To give birth without possession,\nto act without dwelling\"*—\nallowing things to fulfill their nature,\nnot claiming them as one’s own,\neach attaining their proper course without neglecting caution.\nThus, the great peace’s function is achieved.\nIt is still necessary to be cautious each day as one was at the beginning—\nnot daring to rest complacently.\n\n**Commentary:**\nNow, all things attain fulfillment in their natural course,\nyet the Sage does not possess them.\nThe Sage allows all things to follow their own cultivation,\nyet does not rely upon them as his own merit.\nThus, the great peace’s function is ever more expansive and distant,\nyet it is still fitting to remain cautious as at the outset—\nnot daring to rest complacently—\nthis is the Sage’s self-forgetting of his merit.\n*\"It is still necessary to be cautious each day as one was at the beginning\"*—\nthis is the wording of the *Shan Shu*.\nThe Sage who does not dwell in merit,\nthus does not lose it.\nThe Sage who does not dare rest complacently,\nyet constantly refines his virtue,\nforgets his merit while it remains—\nthus, he does not dwell in it and yet does not lose it.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe Sage is upright like a hair,\ncautious to the end as at the beginning,\nhis beginning and end never decaying.\nHe never rests complacently or indulges in ease,\nthus daily renewing his great virtue,\nforgetting his merit while it remains,\nilluminating his dwelling as the world finds peace.\nHence, it is said: *\"The Sage who does not dwell in merit, thus does not lose it.\"*\nDu Guangting states:\n*\"All under heaven know beauty as beauty,\nyet this does not make them virtuous.\"*\nUnder heaven, those who know the Dao are few,\nthe common are many.\nThose who cultivate their bodies are few,\nthose who follow material desires are many.\nAll know beauty and virtue as correct,\nyet few can practice them;\nall know ugliness and evil as incorrect,\nyet few can abandon them.\nThus, the Sage laments them—\nhence *\"ugliness has already arisen,\"*\n*\"evil has already arisen.\"*\n\nTo wear virtue and uphold righteousness,\nembrace the Dao while maintaining humility,\nserve with loyalty and filial piety toward sovereign and kin,\nand cherish brotherly harmony among relatives—\nthese are not merely acts of beauty and goodness,\nyet all know them while few can practice them.\nTo act contrary to these is evil,\nyet all know them while few can abandon them—\nhow much less can they cultivate the Way of *wuwei*?\nThus, they are deceptive.\n\nDelusion (*mang*) is not true principle.\nWhen mind arises from conditions,\nemotions stir with things,\nand failing to uphold the Dao or follow constancy—\nthis is delusion indeed.\n\nThe wondrous and the foul, the divine and the rotten—\nas in the *Zhuangzi*’s *\"Know North Game\"* chapter,\nthe Yellow Emperor told Know:\n*\"All things are one.\"*\nWhat they deem wondrous becomes divine,\nwhat they abhor becomes foul,\nyet foul transforms into divine,\nand divine into foul—\nthus it is said: *\"It permeates Heaven and Earth as one qi.\"*\n\nThe Sage values unity.\nThis reveals that divine and foul are but the partial nature of things.\nA hundred schools and nine currents,\neach clinging to their *shi* and *fei*,\nmutually passing judgment—\nwhether governing the body or the realm,\nif one acts without doing and trusts in spontaneity,\nunifying all with one thread,\nthen foul and divine naturally become undivided.\n\nThus, being and non-being generate each other.\nLaozi lamented those who cling to constancy,\nlost in the true path,\ndelusively opposing each other,\nentangled in illusory emotions—\nhence, this principle is taught to loosen their grasp.\n\n*Existence* (*zhu*) is attachment.\nTo cling to existence is to reject non-being,\nto cling to non-being is to reject existence.\nTo cling to difficulty is to reject ease,\nto cling to ease is to reject difficulty.\nTo cling to short is to reject long,\nto cling to long is to reject short.\nTo cling to high is to reject low,\nto cling to low is to reject high.\nTo cling to later is to reject earlier,\nto cling to earlier is to reject later.\nBecause of this clinging, none reach ultimate truth.\n\nThus the scripture says: *\"The clinging one loses it.\"*\nBut without partial attachment,\none naturally aligns with the Middle Way,\nentering the gate of profound and true observation.\n\nDifficulty and ease complement each other.\nDifficulty arises from ease—\nwithout ease, one cannot know difficulty.\nEase arises from difficulty—\nwithout difficulty, one cannot recognize ease.\nIn cyclic dependence, each serves its turn.\nExamining and clarifying them,\nin difficulty there is no obstruction,\nin ease there is no attachment—\nthen one may speak of harmonizing all things,\npenetrating the Middle Way.\n\n*A gōng* is a term for skilled craftsmanship,\nwhile *táo* refers to shaping clay into vessels.\nEach excels in their own art—this is ease,\nbut to force them into another’s method—this is difficulty.\n\nLong and short contrast each other.\nThings have forms of short and long,\naffairs unfold with laws of difficulty and ease,\ntransformation arises with changes of being and non-being—\nall this is natural.\nIf one clings to common perceptions,\nthen long must remain long,\nshort must remain short.\nDo difficulty, ease, being, and non-being lie within this?\nTo be obstructed is attachment;\nto be fluid is the Dao.\nOnly those who follow the Dao can avoid obstruction.\n\nThe metaphor of the duck and crane\nalso comes from the *Zhuangzi*’s *\"Interlocking Thumbs\"* chapter,\nmeaning each has its own proper form—\none cannot impose this standard on that,\nnor alter it through gain or loss.\nThis rejects the world’s failure to trust in spontaneity.\n\nHigh and low incline toward each other.\nThe establishment of high and low\nnames forms, status, and positions,\ntalents, wisdom, and achievements—\nwithin all their diversity, high and low exist.\nThus, it is not merely constrained by titles and rank.\n\nBut when the high forget their elevation,\nand the low forget their subordination,\neach abides in its proper place,\nguarding the natural order,\nthen there will be no usurpation or encroachment.\n\nA subject is the humble designation for a man,\na concubine is the humble designation for a woman.\nThey are humble and subservient to others,\nthus called *chen* and *qie*.\n*Cushu*: refers to the doctrine of names and ranks.\nThis is to broadly warn against the world’s inclinations.\n\nSpeaking of the Dao of high and low,\neach abides in its proper place,\nwithout encroachment or usurpation,\nthen it preserves its beginning and end.\n\nIf one abandons humility and covets high rank,\nor despises lowliness and schemes for exalted position,\nfailing to accept one’s natural station,\ndisaster will follow.\nThus the *Classic* says:\n*\"Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,\nknowing restraint brings no peril.\nThis ensures longevity—\nhow can one not be warned?\"*\n\nSounds harmonize with one another.\nWhen Heaven and Earth exhale *qi*, all tones arise;\nwhen the *Lü* and *Yue* harmonize, all music is born.\nThe origin of sound carries beauty or vice with it.\nThus there are distinctions between\nserene joy, resentment, anger,\ngrief, melancholy, and sorrowful lament.\n\nYet these distinctions,\nthough imposed by human affairs and followed by governance,\nare forgotten by those of penetrating insight.\nTo follow change while ignoring reality is called *mangqing* (erroneous emotion).\nOnly when beauty and vice are both forgotten\ndoes one attain the Dao.\n\nThose who grasp the Dao,\nthough vast as Heaven and Earth,\nthough teeming as all things,\nremain unaffected.\n\nThe *Record of Music* states:\n*\"All sounds arise from the human heart.\nThe heart, moved by things, manifests in sound.\nSounds resonate and thus create variation—\nvariation realized is called music.\nComparing sounds to create music,\nand using *gan* and *qi* (weapons and feathers) to complete it,\nis called *yue* (ritual music).\nThus, when the heart is moved by sorrow,\nits sound is sharp and restrained;\nwhen moved by joy,\nits sound is bright and slow;\nwhen moved by happiness,\nits sound is unrestrained and dispersed;\nwhen moved by anger,\nits sound is coarse and fierce;\nwhen moved by reverence,\nits sound is upright and austere;\nwhen moved by love,\nits sound is harmonious and gentle.\nTherefore, the ancient kings were cautious in what moved them,\nusing ritual to guide their intentions,\nmusic to harmonize their hearts,\ngovernance to unify their actions,\nand law to prevent deceit.\nRitual, music, law, and governance—\ntheir ultimate aim is one.\"*\n\nThe Dao of sound and music aligns with governance.\n*Gong* is the sovereign,\n*Shang* is the minister,\n*Jiao* is the people,\n*Zheng* is affairs,\n*Yu* is things.\nIf these five remain unconfused,\nthere will be no discordant tones.\n\nIn a well-ordered age, music is serene and joyful—\nits governance is harmonious;\nin a chaotic age, music is resentful and angry—\nits governance is misaligned;\nin a doomed state, music is mournful and reflective—\nits people are suffering.\n\nIf *Gong* is disordered, the land becomes barren,\nand its ruler grows arrogant;\nif *Shang* is disordered, the officials are corrupt;\nif *Jiao* is disordered, the people are anxious;\nif *Zheng* is disordered, affairs are laborious;\nif *Yu* is disordered, resources are depleted.\nWhen all five are disordered,\nthey successively oppress one another—this is called *màn* (decadence).\n\nThe music of Zheng and Wei\nis the music of chaotic times,\ncomparable to *màn*.\nThe songs of Sangjian and Puxia\nare the music of a dying state—\nits governance is scattered,\nits people drift away.\n\nThose who know sound but not music\nare like beasts;\nthose who know music but not *yue* (ritual music)\nare the common folk.\nOnly the noble can know *yue*,\ndiscerning sound to know music,\ndiscerning music to know governance,\ndiscerning governance to approach ritual.\n\nZi Xia replied to Duke Wen of Wei:\n*\"The music of Zheng seduces and indulges the mind,\nthe music of Song lacks restraint and drowns the mind,\nthe music of Wei is repetitive and vexes the mind,\nthe music of Qi is arrogant and defiant.\nThese four harm virtue—\nthey are not proper music.\"*\n\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*,\nYan Zi replied to Duke Jing of Qi:\n*\"The ancient kings blended the five flavors to harmonize the five tones,\nto calm the heart,\nto complete governance.\nMusic is like flavor.\"*\n\nOne: *qi* (breath), which stirs movement;\nTwo: *ti* (form), which embodies the dances of Wen and Wu;\nThree: *lei* (category), which encompasses *feng*, *ya*, and *song*;\nFour: *wu* (things), which uses the materials of the four directions to craft instruments.\n\nThe five tones: *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zheng*, *yu*.\nThe six *lü*: *Huangzhong*, *Dadu*, *Guxi*, *Ruibin*, *Yizhi*, *Wushè*.\nThe six *lü*: *Jiangzhong*, *Linzhong*, *Zhonglü*, *Yingzhong*, *Nanlü*, *Dalu*.\n*Lü* governs the yang,\n*lü* governs the yin.\n\nThe seven tones were established by King Wu\nwhen he conquered Zhou—\nfrom *wu* (noon) to *zi* (midnight),\nseven days were measured as seven tones.\n\nThe eight winds are the winds of the eight directions:\nEast: *Ming Shu*,\nSoutheast: *Qing Ming*,\nSouth: *Ying Feng*,\nSouthwest: *Liang Feng*,\nWest: *Yanhé*,\nNorth: *Guang Mo*,\nNorthwest: *Buzhou*,\nNortheast: *Rong Feng*.\n\n*Jiugong* is the song of the six ministries and three affairs,\nthe nine functions in song.\nClear and turbid, small and great,\nshort and long, swift and slow,\ngrief and joy, firm and yielding,\nfast and slow, high and low,\nentering and exiting, circulating—\nthese complement and assist one another.\nThe noble listens to them to calm the heart;\nwhen the heart is calm, virtue harmonizes,\nand only then does one approach the Dao.\n\nShun created the five-stringed *qin*,\nand sang *\"The South Wind\"*;\nQiu first instituted music,\nand bestowed it upon the feudal lords.\n\nThe method of governing the state\nlies in knowing order and disorder through music,\nthus the son of Duke Wu of Wu, Ji Zha,\nlistened to the ancient and modern music of the Three Dynasties,\nand knew their rise and fall.\n\nThose who cultivate themselves\nobserve in stillness and listen in silence,\nlistening to the unsounded—\nonly then can they speak of the Dao.\n\nBefore and after follow one another.\nThe distinction between before and after\narises from change and movement.\nWithout change or motion,\nwho comes first, who follows?\nOnce there is succession,\nthen before and after are divided.\n\nThose of penetrating insight\nerase and forget all distinctions—\nthe world’s laws only emphasize their differences.\n\n*Touzu* refers to taking a step.\nWhen a step is taken,\nwhich comes first, which follows?\n\nThose who are enlightened in this\nare thus freed from the bounds of before and after.\n\nLaozi, moved by pity for the common folk\nwandering in confusion without return,\nquarrelling over false passions,\nforgetting the central Dao,\npointed out the Six Matters\nto awaken the ignorant and the deluded.\n\nFor the central Dao is neither yin nor yang,\nhaving no partial name.\nIt dwells between Heaven and Earth,\nproud and unrestrained in its self-sojourning,\ncontent with whatever it encounters—\nfree from all striving for gain or fame,\nyet returning to the root of the Dao.\nEven the differences between Yao and Jie,\nthe shifts of life and death,\nthe distinctions of right and wrong,\nthe disparities of long and short-lived,\nthe gulf between honor and disgrace,\nthe stirrings of sorrow and joy,\nthe succession of ancient and modern times—\nall are forgotten by it.\n\nTo not know the differences between Yao and Jie\nis to forget the distinction between good and evil.\nTo not know the shifts of life and death\nis to forget the existence of anything.\nTo not know the distinctions of right and wrong\nis to forget the difficulty of what is easy.\nTo not know the disparities of long and short-lived\nis to forget the length and brevity of things.\nTo not know the gulf between honor and disgrace\nis to forget high and low.\nTo not know the stirrings of sorrow and joy\nis to forget sound and voice.\nTo not know the succession of ancient and modern times\nis to forget before and after.\n\nDwelling in the realm of no \"rightness,\"\nstanding on the path of no \"hurry,\"\nencountering it without resistance,\npassing it without clinging,\nadjusting to it with virtue,\naligning with it through the Dao—\n\nAdding to it without conferring benefit,\nsubtracting from it without conferring harm—\nthese are the ones who have fully grasped the central Dao,\nforgetting the distinctions of before and after,\nforgetting the mechanisms of change.\n\nThus, the Sage attains the highest teaching.\nFor the Sage is one who aligns with Heaven and Earth in virtue,\nwith the sun and moon in luminosity,\nwith the Four Seasons in order,\nwith the spirits and gods in auspicious and inauspicious omens—\nsuch is called the Sage.\n\nBriefly speaking, there are five categories.\nFirst, the Sage who attains the Dao: the Supreme Sage Laozi, the Great Sages of the heavens.\nSecond, the Sage who holds the position under Heaven and attains the virtue of immortality: Fu Xi, the Yellow Emperor, Zhuānxū, Shàohào, Yao, and Shun.\nThird, the Sage who holds the position under Heaven but lacks the virtue of immortality: the Sages of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, Tang, and Wen and Wu of the Zhou.\nAll of them cleared the Six Extremes, yet they did not speak of ascending to Heaven.\n\nFourth, the Sage of broad and comprehensive virtue without the position under Heaven:\nZhougong and Confucius established rituals and music,\nset examples for a hundred kings,\nyet did not hold the Nine Five position,\nyet all possessed the beauty of aligning with Heaven and Earth’s virtue.\n\nFifth, the Sage with singular excellence,\nwithout the name of broad and comprehensive virtue,\nnor possessing the virtues of the above categories:\nthe Sage of the *qín* (琴) is Boya and Shifu;\nthe Sage of chess is Ziqing and Suiming;\nthe Sage of discerning sound is Zhongqi and Yanzhou;\nthe Sage of singing is Han Ao and Qin Qing;\nthe Sage of wisdom is Gong Sun and Wen Zhi;\nthe Sage of vision and hearing is Lizhu and Shigong;\nthe Sage of calligraphy is Zhang Xu and Zhong Xuan.\n\nIn the scriptures, the \"enlightened\" refers to those who govern the world through principles.\nThe Sage who governs the world through principles\nneed only wear formal robes, maintain a respectful demeanor,\nand face south—\nthat is all.\n\nWhat then is this?\nIt is called dwelling in affairs of *wuwei* (無為).\n\nTo observe the beauty of Heaven and Earth,\nto comprehend the principles of all things,\nto follow the course of the Four Seasons—\nwhen the ruler does *wuwei* above,\nthings transform spontaneously below.\nThis may be called practicing the teaching of *non-speech* (不言).\n\nTo govern the realm thus,\nthen the people find contentment in their dwellings,\njoy in their customs,\nand align with the Dao.\n\nAll things arise and act without complaint.\nThe Sage, regarding all things,\nhas them exist naturally since antiquity—\nwhy should they await his doing before existing?\nThings find their own way to life,\nmoving spontaneously, as in the words of the *Taixuan Jing* (《太玄经》):\n*\"Free to wander, free to delight.\"*\n\nWhen the ruler above does *wuwei*,\nthose below naturally thrive,\nthus there is leisure.\n\nThe \"striking the earth\" (擊壤) refers to earth, the soil.\nAs in the *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》□馬蹄篇):\n*\"In the time of Huixu, the people carried food in their mouths and played,\ndrummed their bellies and wandered.\"*\n\nThose unaware of the Sovereign’s power—\nas Wang Chong (*Lunheng* 《论衡》) says:\n*\"Emperor Yao ruled with boundless ease,\nso nameless to the people.\nAn old man of fifty struck the earth by the roadside,\ndrummed his belly, and sang:\n'We dig wells to drink,\ntill fields to eat,\nrise with the sun, rest with the moon—\nwhat power does the Sovereign hold over me?'\nThis is the common folk forgetting the Sage’s deeds.\"*\n\nBorn and yet not dwelling—\n*not residing* (不居).\n\nThe Sage, in dwelling among things, is not harmed by them;\nthings fulfill their own nature.\nWhen things fulfill their own nature,\nthe Sage does not claim their fruits but relies on their virtue—\ntrusting in Nature, abiding in perfect harmony.\n\nNow, *function* (功) has different names:\nThe ruler’s *function* is called *merit* (勋),\nas when the Duke of Zhou aided the King’s work.\nThe state’s *function* is called *achievement* (功),\nas when Yi Yin preserved the nation.\nThe people’s *function* is called *service* (庸),\nas when Hou Ji taught the laws of cultivation.\nThe laborer’s *function* is called *toil* (劳),\nas when Yu of Xia stabilized the realm through exertion.\nThe administrator’s *function* is called *accomplishment* (绩),\nas when Gou Sun established just ordinances.\nThe warrior’s *function* is called *victory* (多),\nas when Han Xin triumphed with unconventional strategy.\n\nYet the *mysterious function* (玄功) is that which brings forth all things—\nits depth and reach are profound, hence called *mysterious*.\nWhen function is complete yet not claimed,\nthe Sage preserves the virtue of *wuwei*.\n\nDay by day, he grows more cautious—\nalready explained in detail—\nfor the Sage’s deeds reach outward,\nyet he does not boast, only fears failing his purpose,\nlest his function collapse.\nThus he is ever vigilant, never at rest.\n\n*Ning* (宁) means both *tranquility* and *diligence*.\nThe Sage’s *wuwei* is vast in its function,\nthings fulfill their nature without loss,\nthe heavens clear above, the earth settled below,\nthe Four Seas unified in peace—\nserene and at rest—\nthis is called *Great Peace*.\n\nNow, *only* (夫惟) is the opening phrase—\nmeaning the Sage does not depart from non-possession.\nThe Sage’s influence extends to the Four Seas, yet he does not claim it;\nhis benevolence covers all things, yet he does not call it favor;\nhis function shapes the world, yet he does not take it as his own;\nhis virtue surpasses the Four Seasons, yet he does not rule as master.\nHe forgets himself in the Dao,\nharmonizes his will with the Void,\ndwelling above yet not making others feel his weight,\ndwelling before yet not harming them,\nthe world willingly follows, yet none grow weary—\nthus his resolve does not waver.\n\nThe ruler who does not err in joy or anger\navoids excessive punishments and rewards,\nand war does not arise.\n\nWho does not err in seeking and taking\navoids heavy taxation and burdensome provisions.\n\nWho does not err in love or hatred\nensures proper appointments and distinguishes the worthy from the unworthy.\n\nWho does not err in choosing attendants\nmakes all around him upright.\n\nWho does not err in governing lands\nkeeps arms idle and soldiers unlabored.\n\nWho does not err in treating the people\nbrings peace to the world.\n\nThings find their proper place,\nnot relying on function,\n*wuwei* without seeking its benefits—\ntruly vast and profound!\n\n*\"Thick and straight as hair\"*—words from the *Shijing* (《诗□小雅□都人士篇》),\nspeaking of emotions sincere and conduct upright,\nlike the root and tip of a hair—\nno excess, no deficiency.\n\nThe Dao of the ruler says:\n*\"When all know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises.\nThe Dao has no differing forms—who decides what is good or evil?\nNature is inherently unified—who judges right or wrong?\nWhere there is beauty, there is its opposite, ugliness.\nThus, when all know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.\nWhere there is goodness, there is its opposite, ungoodness.\nThus, when all know goodness as goodness, ungoodness arises.\nWhat the world now admires as divine and strange,\nit once despised as foul and rotten.\nDivine and strange may transform into foul and rotten,\nfoul and rotten may transform into divine and strange—\nthen how can beauty and ugliness be distinguished?\nWhat was once right may later be wrong.\nWhat is now discarded may later be used.\"*\n\nThen how can goodness and ungoodness be chosen?\n\nThe Sage embodies the True One—ever present yet ever absent,\nmanifesting wondrous use yet ever without—\nbeauty and ugliness, goodness and ungoodness,\nare all but simplified away—\nhow then could evil and ungoodness ever burden?\n\nThus, the interplay of *having* and *non-having* unfolds,\nforever preceding and following.\nBefore the *Tàiyī* was differentiated, all phenomena shared one body.\nOnce the Two Forces emerged, each thing found its opposite.\n\nThese six pairs—\nwhere myriad transformations intersect,\nwhere myriad thoughts arise,\nwhere divergent paths begin—\nare the snares by which the world is ensnared, unable to escape.\n\nWithout motion, there is *having*;\n*having* returns to *non-having*—\nthus, the interplay of *having* and *non-having*.\nWhere there is peril in crossing,\none knows the ease of traversing—\nthus, the interplay of difficulty and ease,\nof length and shortness—\nas with inches and spans.\nHigh and low take form in contrast—\nas with mountains and marshes.\nSound rises, echo responds—\nthus, the harmony of sound and voice.\nForm moves, shadow follows—\nthus, the succession of before and after.\n\nThe movement of yin and yang,\nthe progression of the four seasons,\nthe principles of all things—\nsuddenly formed, then suddenly vanished.\nIts difficulty is like deliberate action governing the world;\nits ease is like effortless alignment with nature.\n\nWhat is long is not to be severed,\nwhat is short is not to be extended—\nheaven naturally ascends, earth naturally descends.\nStrike the *gōng* and the *gōng* resonates;\nstrike the *jué* and the *jué* responds.\nSpring comes first, summer follows;\nthe elder precedes, the younger follows.\n\nThough these paired realms all rest within the Dao,\nthey are far from the Dao itself.\n\nThus, the Sage’s supreme teaching:\nto act in *wuwei*, as *Zhuangzi* said—\n*\"to govern the world without action.\"*\nTo practice speechless instruction, as the *Yijing* taught—\n*\"to set the divine Way as teaching, and the world submits.\"*\n\nTo act is to risk failure;\nto speak is to risk error—\nhow could this ever be free from entanglement?\nHow could this be the Sage’s way of standing above all things,\ntransforming all things without being burdened by them?\n\nAll things arise, yet the Sage does not decline or withdraw.\nAll things act in concert, responding as sensed—\nlike a mirror reflecting form, revealing beauty and ugliness alike;\nlike a valley echoing sound, revealing goodness and evil alike—\nwithout refusal.\n\nThus, *\"all things arise, yet the Sage does not decline.\"*\nThey self-generate, self-transform,\nself-form, self-color,\neach reaching their utmost height and fulfilling their nature—\nwho could claim ownership?\nThus, *\"to give birth yet not possess.\"*\n\nTo harmonize all things yet seek no gain,\nto benefit ten thousand generations yet claim no transformation,\nto encompass heaven and earth, to carve all forms yet claim no craft—\nthus, *\"to act yet not rely.\"*\n\nThe seasons turn, and the effective departs—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\nThe Sage embodies it,\nso achievements cover the world yet seem not of oneself—\nto claim them would only be self-deception.\nThus, *\"when success is achieved, do not dwell upon it.\"*\nDwelling invites departure—\nas past and present attest.\nTo dwell within oneself is to remain unshaken;\nto follow the coming is natural,\nto follow the going is natural—\nwhat harm or gain is there?\nThus, *\"only by not dwelling does one not depart.\"*\n\nWang Anshi said:\n*\"When all know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises.\"*\nBeauty is the opposite of ugliness,\ngoodness the opposite of ungoodness—\nthis is the constant principle of things.\nOnly the Sage stands without opposition to all things.\nWhat is not the Sage’s doing all has opposites.\nThus, the interplay of *having* and *non-having* unfolds,\nforever preceding and following.\n\n*Having* and *non-having*,\ndifficulty and ease,\nlength and shortness,\nhigh and low,\nsound and voice,\nbefore and after—\nall inevitably have their opposites.\nOnly by transcending these six pairs\ncan one enter the divine—\nand entering the divine, one stands without opposition between heaven and earth.\n\n*The Zìshuō* says:\n*\"Wu* from *dà*, *lín* from *wáng*—\nthe ultimate of *having* is to return to *non-having*.*\nLaozi said:\n*\"The interplay of having and non-having.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage’s supreme teaching:\nThe Sage, observing that *having* has opposites,\ntherefore acts in *wuwei* and teaches without speech.\nThe Sage never fails to act—\nyet action arises from *wuwei*.\nThe Sage never fails to speak—\nyet speech arises from *non-speech*.\n\nFrom *\"giving birth yet not possessing\"* to *\"achieving success yet not dwelling\"*—\nto give birth yet not claim its birth,\nto act yet not rely on the act,\nto achieve success yet not dwell upon it—\nthese three arise from *wu-wǒ* (no-self).\n\nOnly by *wu-wǒ* does one not lose oneself.\nNot only does one not lose oneself,\nbut one also does not lose others.\nTo fail to know *wu-wǒ* and instead dwell in *yǒu-wǒ* (self),\nis not only to lose oneself—\nbut also to lose others.\n\nTo dwell upon success is to invite departure;\ndwelling and departure are opposites.\nThe Sage’s three non-dwellings—\nonly then does the Dao abide within oneself,\nand not depart.\n\nSu Yán said:\n*\"When all know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises.\"*\nThe world judges beauty and ugliness by form and name.\nWhat they call beautiful and good—\nis it truly beautiful and good?\nThey do not know the interplay of *having* and *non-having*,\ndifficulty and ease, length and shortness, high and low,\nsound and voice, before and after—\nall these are not their true nature.\n\nJust as one assumes length, yet a longer one surpasses—\nthen one is short.\nJust as one assumes precedence, yet a prior one comes—\nthen one is last.\nIf one follows what is deemed beautiful and believes it,\none strays far from the truth.\n\nThus, the Sage’s supreme teaching:\nWhen acting, hold the heart of *wuwei*;\nwhen teaching, hold the intent of *non-speech*—\nthus, transcending measures of length and shortness,\nfree from ranks of before and after,\nneither beautiful nor ugly,\nneither good nor ungood—\nhow could the world ever comprehend?\n\nFrom *\"all things arise\"* to *\"not dwelling\"*—\nall things act for me, yet I decline none;\nI give birth to them, yet never claim or rely—\neven in success, I never dwell upon it—\nthis is the teaching of *wuwei* and *non-speech*,\nits beauty and goodness beyond measure.\n\nNo evil or ungoodness could follow it—\nfor the Sage’s ultimate teaching is *not departing*.\n\nThe Sage dwells in poverty and lowliness yet knows no worry of poverty or lowliness;\ndwells in wealth and honor yet bears no burden of wealth and honor—\nthis is called *not dwelling*.\n\nIf I do not dwell, how could others depart?\nThis is the ultimate of *dwelling*.\n\nLu Jiufu said:\nAll under heaven know that the ultimate is not ungood.\nAll under heaven know beauty as beauty, goodness as goodness,\nyet desire to know evil and ungoodness to hate them—\nyet when speaking of the Dao itself,\neven beauty and goodness depart from the Dao.\nWhen speaking of the Dao’s emergence,\neven evil and ungoodness are not outside it.\nThus observed, beauty becomes evil, goodness becomes ungood—\nis this not true?\n\nHence, *having* and *non-having* generate and follow one another.\nThings under heaven arise from *having*, *having* from *non-having*—\nthis is called the generation of *having* and *non-having*.\nDifficult things arise from ease, yet ease arises from difficulty—\nwithout difficulty, there would be no ease—\nthis is called the completion of difficult and easy.\nThe crane’s long legs reveal the hare’s short;\nthe duck’s short legs reveal the crane’s long—\nthis is called the contrast of long and short.\nIf high is taken as true, then all valleys are the source of rivers—\nthen high would tilt toward the low.\nIf low is taken as true, then rivers are the confluence of valleys—\nthen low would tilt toward the high.\nThis is called the mutual incline of high and low.\nIf the yellow bell is master, the other bells harmonize;\nif the other bells are master, the yellow bell harmonizes—\nthis is called the mutual resonance of sounds.\nFrom autumn and winter, spring and summer appear prior;\nfrom spring and summer, autumn and winter appear prior—\nthis is called the succession of before and after.\nThus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching:\nThe Sage acts in *wuwei*, yet *wuwei* means no action—\nno action, no mind; the Sage’s mind is the people’s mind.\nHe teaches through *non-speech*, yet *non-speech* means no words—\nno words, yet words emerge from *non-speech*.\nThough deeds leave no trace of doing,\nthough teaching reveals no intent of speech,\nyet affairs are accomplished, and teaching takes root.\nAll things act, yet he declines none—\nhis virtue is ultimate, without the burden of success.\nHe would make people return to simplicity, become companions of Heaven and Earth,\nfriends of Creation and Transformation.\nFor the ultimate is *not departing*.\n\n*Not departing* is the opposite of departing—\nthis Dao abides within me, how could it ever shift?\n\nLu Nongshi said:\nAll under heaven know that the ultimate is not ungood.\nWhen beauty reaches *non-beauty*, that is true beauty under heaven.\nWhen goodness reaches *non-goodness*, that is true goodness under heaven.\nTrue beauty departs, yet all under heaven know beauty as beauty.\nTrue goodness disperses, yet all under heaven know goodness as goodness.\nHence, *having* and *non-having* generate and follow one another.\n*Having* and *non-having* speak of the Dao’s essence,\ndifficult and easy speak of its virtue,\nlong and short speak of its form,\nhigh and low speak of its position,\nsounds speak of mutual resonance,\nbefore and after speak of beginning and end—\nthis is the natural order.\nThus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching:\nThe Sage acts in *wuwei*, teaches through *non-speech*,\nto make people merge with true goodness, blend with true beauty,\nreturn to simplicity, and become companions of Heaven and Earth,\nfriends of Creation and Transformation.\nAll things act, yet he declines none—\nhe does not depart.\nAll things exhale, and he follows them inward without resistance;\nall things arise, and he follows them outward without refusal.\n\nWang Yuanzai said:\nAll under heaven know that the ultimate is not ungood.\nThe Dao is originally without things;\nthings have delusive emotions, self-differentiating—\nthis is drowning in the flow of transformation, unable to emerge.\nYet those who drown do not emerge because they do not weary of attachment\nbut instead cling to delight—\nthus they hate ungoodness.\nHence, evil and ungoodness follow beauty and goodness.\nWhen beauty and goodness arise, they are already evil and ungood.\nWaiting for their reversal to awaken is already late.\nStill, the Perfect One says beauty and goodness have not departed from evil and ungoodness,\nnor have evil and ungoodness departed from beauty and goodness.\nThe foolish under heaven cannot comprehend this.\nThus, beauty and goodness are always evil and ungood.\n\n*The New Saying* states:\nThis speaks of those who blindly follow beauty and goodness,\npreferring evil and ungoodness to beauty and goodness.\nOnly the Sage, detached and far-seeing, knows\nthat beauty contains evil, goodness contains ungoodness—\nnever drowning in them.\n\nHence, *having* and *non-having* generate and follow one another.\nTo separate from the Dao is to create *self*—\n*self* creates *other*.\nOnce *self* and *other* divide, duality arises in all things.\nThis is why emotions, life and death, and transformations\nemerge and recede without end—\nall failing to grasp the root of yin and yang,\ninstead following superficial distinctions,\nfixating on one while abandoning the rest,\ntaking delusion as truth.\n\nThis second section resembles *Zhuangzi’s \"Equating Things\"* in structure,\nwith a sequential argument that can be logically traced.\nThus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching:\nThe Sage’s mind is the people’s mind—\nthough he acts, he never advances his own doing;\nthough he teaches, he never reveals his intent of speech.\nYet affairs are accomplished, teaching takes root,\nwhile I remain still, never burdened by words,\nand all under heaven thus return to simplicity.\n\nOnly without burden could one,\nthough lodged between yin and yang,\nresist the sway of Creation and Transformation.\n\nThe six pairs—how could they disturb him?\nTen thousand things arise without refusal.\nWhen all things arise together,\nthe Sage exhausts their nature without hesitation,\nfor my mind is still—\nwithout grasping or rejecting.\n\nIf one harbors thoughts of grasping or rejecting,\nthen the myriad forms of things—beautiful or ugly—are endless.\nHow could one refuse them?\n\nBorn yet never dwelling.\nTo dwell is to perish.\nOnly the utterly non-dwelling endures.\nOnce form and name descend,\nall undergo transformation and decay—\nyet the Dao has no substance,\nand nothing can displace it.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao,\nthus filling all without boundary,\nyet never possessing anything;\nresponding to ten thousand changes,\nyet never harboring intent.\n\nThen how could one cling to transient affairs,\nfixating on them as achievement?\nOnly then does one transcend the realm of the six pairs,\nsever the names of beauty and ugliness,\nand dwell in the eternal law beyond birth and death.\n\nHolding this mind to traverse the world,\neven if fame and achievement are lofty,\nhow could there be the burden of arrogance?\n\nLiu Zhongping said:\nWhen all under heaven know that the utmost ugliness is ugliness,\nthen ugliness cannot persist—\nit becomes beauty instead.\nWhen all under heaven know that the utmost goodness is goodness,\nthen goodness cannot persist—\nit becomes non-goodness instead.\n\nThus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching:\nOnly the solitary one dwells in the affairs of non-action,\npracticing the teaching of non-speech,\nso that all under heaven do not know of my goodness or beauty.\nThis is how the Dao teaches without departing—\nfor it is utterly non-departing.\nFor it is utterly non-dwelling,\nthus non-departing is achieved—\nthis is why it is called non-dwelling.\nNon-dwelling means standing independently\namidst the six pairs.\n\nThe people are in ignorance,\nalready swept along by the six pairs.\nIf one cuts off and departs from these six,\nand does not respond with deeds or teachings,\nthen what reliance do the people have?\nOnly by not dwelling on achievement\ndoes one, though not departing,\nsave them greatly.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Follow ten thousand things without departing.\"*\n\nLiu Jujie said:\nWhen all under heaven know that the utmost ugliness is ugliness,\nthen wondrous names arise, and beauty and goodness emerge.\nWhen false names arise, ugliness and non-goodness emerge.\nWhen the name of beauty arises, ugliness emerges.\nWhen the name of goodness arises, non-goodness emerges—\nall are deviations from the Dao.\nThough the natures of good and evil may arise,\ntheir names and words have no end.\nThe vulgar cannot know this,\nyet they know what they favor,\nand call it beautiful—\nwhile ugliness follows.\nThey call it good—\nwhile non-goodness follows.\n\nThe Sage, though unable to sever good and evil,\ncannot stand apart from them either.\nYet he can turn beauty into ugliness,\nand goodness into non-goodness,\nor turn ugliness into beauty,\nand non-goodness into goodness.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"What is deemed wondrous becomes foul decay,\nwhat is deemed foul decay becomes wondrous—\nfoul decay and wondrousness cyclically transform.\"*\n\nThus, being and non-being generate and follow one another.\nHe who gains a deer may lose it immediately;\nhe who loses a horse may gain it again.\nGain and loss have no fixed end—\nthis is the pattern of generation.\nWater cannot be a carriage,\nland cannot be a boat—\nskill and clumsiness have no fixed end—\nthis is the pattern of mutual completion.\nThe mycelium and the morning mushroom—\nlongevity and early death have no fixed end—\nthis is the pattern of contrast.\nKings and beggars—\nnobility and lowliness have no fixed end—\nthis is the pattern of inversion.\nOne dreams of drinking wine,\nthen wakes to weeping—\nsorrow and joy have no fixed end—\nthis is the pattern of harmony.\nInfancy, youth, old age, and death—\nlife and death have no fixed end—\nthis is the pattern of succession.\n\nThese six pairs,\nall arise from the naming of good and evil—\nspeaking of what has no ultimate end.\n\nOnly when one awakens in the depths of obscurity\ncan one know this,\nand knowing it, harmonize with it.\n\nThus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching:\nOnce good and evil are distinguished,\nthe six pairs emerge.\nFor the people, it is better to remain ignorant—\nthen their nobility is profound.\nThose who share the people’s afflictions\nthus engage in affairs.\nAnd there are teachings—\nthose far away are served without action,\nwhich is the affair of non-action.\nThose nearby are taught with speech,\nwhich is the teaching of non-goodness.\nAffairs and teachings exist\nonly to rescue the vulgar,\nyet they return to the same flow,\nand are swept along by the six pairs—\nhow then can they be considered noble?\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The utmost speech is beyond speech,\nthe utmost action is beyond action.*\nTen thousand things arise without refusal—\nthis expounds the meaning of non-speech,\ncommitting ten thousand things to self-creation,\nyet unable to explain them,\nhence ‘arise without refusal.’\nOnce they arise, they are born;\nonce born, teaching takes root—\nthis is why it is called ‘born yet not possessed.’\nThose who attribute speech to words\nare those who cannot help but exhaust their mouths.\n\nOnly the utterly non-departing—\nacting yet not relying,\nachieving yet not dwelling—\nthis expounds how non-action leads to accomplishment.\nWhen there is action, achievement follows;\nwhen there is achievement, dwelling follows.\nIf one attends to action beforehand,\nthen dwelling comes afterward.\"\n\nLiu Ji said:\nWhen all under heaven know that beauty is beauty,\nthen non-departing is achieved.\nBefore differentiation, all things were one body.\nOnce the two *qi* divide,\nthings form opposing pairs.\nOnce called beautiful,\nthen purity is lost—\nevil must oppose it.\nOnce called good,\nthen nature is severed—\nnon-goodness must oppose it.\nBeauty may become ugliness,\ngoodness may become non-goodness—\njust as being and non-being generate,\ndifficulty and ease complete,\nlong and short contrast,\nhigh and low invert,\nsounds harmonize,\nbefore and after succeed—\nthese six pairs may affirm or negate,\nreverse or persist,\nand are not the ultimate rectitude of all under heaven.\n\nWhat was once right may later be wrong,\nwhat was once discarded may later be used.\n\nIs this not like beauty being called beauty, goodness being called good—\nyet their nature remains undetermined?\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"The right may become the strange,\nthe good may become the ominous.\"*\nThis is indeed so.\n\nMoreover, the principles of all under heaven:\nWhere there is action, there is gain and loss;\nwhere there is speech, there is right and error—\nnone are free from entanglement.\n\nThus, the Sage engages in *wuwei* (non-action),\nconducts *buyan* (non-teaching).\nThrough this, he transcends things and people,\nstanding alone above all things,\nnot opposing things—\nand thus nothing can pair with him.\nThis is what *Liezi* called *\"doubtful solitude,\"*\nwhat *Zhuangzi* called *\"the singular possession.\"*\n\nIn *wuwei*, the utmost is to abandon action,\nyet in the silent depths, clarity is alone revealed;\nin *buyan*, the utmost is to abandon speech,\nyet in the soundless void, harmony is alone heard.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao within himself—\nhis mind labors not,\nhis response to things is without measure.\nAll things come to him endlessly, never exhausted,\nso when all things act in concert,\nresponding as they are sensed,\nhe acts with them without reluctance,\nallows all things to generate themselves without claiming their generation,\nallows all things to be themselves without relying on their being.\nHis achievements cover all under heaven,\nyet it seems not his own doing;\nhis transformation benefits all things,\nyet the people do not depend on him.\n\nThus, when achievements are complete, he does not dwell upon them—\nif he dwells, then he must depart.\nTherefore, only by not dwelling does he not depart.\nWhen achievements are complete yet he does not claim them,\nis this not because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous?\nThus, he follows this with *\"not extolling the virtuous.\"*\n\nZhao Shiyuan remarked:\n*\"The opening sequence explains the six pairs.*\n*First, it declares the non-essential nature of the right.*\n*When all under heaven know this, they recognize that evil has already arisen.*\n\n*The Dao De Jing’s discourse on virtue and power*\n*is most profound in its opening chapter.*\n*From the ever-non-existent to the ever-existent,*\n*within the vague and indistinct, form emerges,*\n*unifying all things in one thread.*\n*Again, from the mysterious to the yet more mysterious,*\n*the meaning of gradual and sudden transformation is fully exhausted here.*\n\n*Yet the eighty-one chapters’ principles are interconnected,*\n*their meanings all having their threads.*\n*Once things depart from the subtle gate,*\n*the ever-Dao and ever-name merge*\n*in the realm of beauty and evil.*\n*Thus, it follows with the passage:*\n*'When all under heaven know...'*\n\n*The Dao descending as things,*\n*the ever-present is the body of the Dao.*\n*The body is what fulfills all uses—*\n*how could its use remain fixed in the ever-present?*\n*Thus, following the nature of things, there must be change,*\n*and within things, there must be variation.*\n*The ever-present cannot remain ever-present,*\n*beauty cannot remain ever-beautiful—*\n*as emotions shift and do not align,*\n*good and evil become opposites.*\n\n*The *Shijing* says:*\n*'The gentle autumn wind blows,\nbringing shade and rain.\nPlucking *bo* and *fei*,*\n*do not harm their roots.'*\n*It speaks of how*\n*the emotions of heaven and earth cannot always be harmonious,*\n*the natures of all things cannot always be good.*\n\n*Beauty and evil are neither the Dao nor nature—*\n*they arise from established perceptions.*\n*All established perceptions stem from desire;*\n*the heart of desire knows only that beauty is beauty,*\n*yet does not know that beauty may reverse into evil,*\n*that goodness may reverse into non-goodness.*\n\n*This is how the ever-Dao and ever-name*\n*flow into affairs—*\n*thus, it is said: \"Affairs follow the Dao.\"*\n\n*From this chapter,*\n*beginning with the reversal of good and evil,*\n*to the six pairs not being uniform,*\n*first citing affairs to reveal principles,*\n*then abandoning entanglements to return to truth.*\n\n*The saying \"revealing principles through affairs\"*\n*refers to how the six pairs—*\n*beauty, evil, goodness, non-goodness—*\n*not being uniform are all matters of affairs.*\n*When the Sage engages in *wuwei*,*\n*he perceives principles through affairs,*\n*enters awareness through dust—*\n*who but the Sage could grasp this principle?*\n\n*The Sage, with singular insight, illuminates all,*\n*transcending all forms above,*\n*leaving the realm of flux,*\n*dwelling in the domain of *wuwei*.*\n*What things of all under heaven could entangle him?*\n*This is abandoning entanglements to return to truth.*\n\n*If there is nothing, then there is *wuwei*—*\n*only *wuwei* exists.*\n*If there is something, then affairs arise,*\n*affairs arise from the something.*\n*The Sage would not fearfully establish himself*\n*in the realm of non-affairs.*\n*He simply adapts to changes and governs accordingly.*\n\n*At this point in the text, the discussion shifts to governance.*\n*All discourse on governance*\n*must encompass internal teachings,*\n*then clarify the principles of governance.*\n*Thus, though Confucian scholars may criticize*\n*\"Nashisutong\"* (the room’s teachings),\n*it belongs uniquely to the Sage.*\n*The text first displays the affairs of beauty and evil,*\n*then cites the six pairs to clarify their causes.*\n\n*Second, the realm of opposition.*\n*Thus, the non-existent and existent generate each other,*\n*difficulty and ease complete each other.*\n*The word *zhe* (this) echoes the earlier text,*\n*after lamenting the reversals of beauty, evil, goodness, and non-goodness,*\n*it now marks the six as opposites in the logic of non-existence and existence.*\n\n*Difficulty and ease are matters of affairs,*\n*long and short are matters of talent,*\n*high and low are matters of position,*\n*sounds are matters of pitch and harmony,*\n*before and after are matters of new and old.*\n\n*All things emerge from the mechanism and return to the mechanism,*\n*a hundred transformations arise from soil and return to soil.*\n*Emerging from the mechanism and returning to it—*\n*from the ultimate non-existent, they receive their mandate,*\n*and when they return, they return to the non-existent.*\n*This is speaking of nature.*\n\n*A hundred transformations arise from soil,*\n*from the formed to the formless,*\n*born of things, yet transforming back into soil—*\n*they never depart from the existent.*\n*This is speaking of form.*\n\n*Truly, the existent and non-existent share the same origin in the Dao’s nature—*\n*emerging, they become existent;*\n*returning, they become non-existent.*\n*Just as spring and summer come first,*\n*autumn and winter follow—*\n*beginning and ending complete each other,*\n*alternately hidden, alternately revealed,*\n*the primary meaning within the realm of opposition.*\n\n*Thus, it is said:*\n*\"The non-existent and existent generate each other—*\n*this is principle.*\n*Difficulty and ease complete each other—*\n*affairs have no ease; accumulated difficulty becomes ease.*\n*Affairs have no difficulty; accumulated ease becomes difficulty.*\n\n*Founding a venture is difficult,*\n*preserving it is easy.*\n*Comparing founding to preserving,*\n*though founding is difficult,*\n*its reversal becomes easy—*\n*how is this made clear?*\n*By the righteous overthrowing the unrighteous,*\n*as the hungry are easily fed,*\n*the thirsty are easily quenched—*\n*like Tang and Wu consoling the people and punishing crimes.\"*\n\nThe Way’s nature—when manifest, it is existence;\nwhen withdrawn, it is non-existence.\nAs spring and summer precede,\nautumn and winter follow—\nbeginning and ending complete each other,\nalternately hidden, alternately revealed,\nthe primary meaning within the realm of opposition.\n\nThus, it is said:\n*\"The non-existent and existent generate each other—*\n*this is principle.*\n*Difficulty and ease complete each other—*\n*affairs have no ease; accumulated difficulty becomes ease.*\n*Affairs have no difficulty; accumulated ease becomes difficulty.*\n\n*Founding a venture is difficult,*\n*preserving it is easy.*\n*Comparing founding to preserving,*\n*though founding is difficult,*\n*its reversal becomes easy—*\n*how is this made clear?*\n*By the righteous overthrowing the unrighteous,*\n*as the hungry are easily fed,*\n*the thirsty are easily quenched—*\n*like Tang and Wu consoling the people and punishing crimes.\"*\n\nNow, comparing preserving to founding,\npreserving is easy,\nyet its reversal becomes difficult—\nhow is this made clear?\nA ruler who preserves like one holding a full vessel\nmust keep his heart settled and his will balanced,\nlest he not remain still and composed—\nmovement brings collapse.\nThis is called failing to settle the heart and balance the will,\nand thus it becomes difficult.\n\nTherefore, no ruler who preserves compares to King Cheng.\nIf knowledge is easy, there is affection;\nif obedience is easy, there is merit.\nThough only ease is spoken of and not difficulty,\nthose who can achieve ease hold difficulty within.\nThe world’s affairs—who does not follow this?\nTo make difficult what is easy brings ease,\nto make easy what is difficult brings difficulty.\nThus it is said: *\"Difficulty and ease complete each other.\"*\n\nThis matter also concerns\nthe contrast of long and short.\nAll things born between heaven and earth\nshare the same vital *qi*.\nThose who receive the fullness of *qi* grow long,\nthose who receive its weakness grow short.\nThus ancient people often reached seven *chi* in height,\nwhile today’s people rarely exceed five.\nAncient people were tall and majestic—\nthe full descent of *qi*;\ntoday’s people are short and frail—\nthe gradual weakening of *qi*.\nIs this merely the change of affairs?\nHumans are the same.\nThough some vary, none can remain entirely pure.\nThus, the forms of heaven and humanity have fixed measures,\nand their contrasts serve appropriate uses.\nMaterials fit the hands of a master craftsman,\neach suited to its purpose;\ntalents are placed under the selection of the Sage,\neach fulfilling its virtue.\n\nWhat is naturally long cannot be shortened—\nthe crane’s legs are proof;\nwhat is naturally short cannot be extended—\nthe duck’s legs are proof.\nThus, the long cannot be shortened—\nto do so brings sorrow;\nthe short cannot be lengthened—\nto do so brings worry.\nThis is the natural order.\nYet in human nature, there is neither long nor short—\nonly equality.\nBut in the things of humanity,\nthey are certainly not uniform.\nThe *Transmission* says: *\"The tortoise is longer than the snake,\"*\nnot speaking of form but of principle.\n*\"Yin is deficient to yang,\"*\nnot speaking of *qi* but of virtue.\nThere are those like the bones of the *Fangfeng* people,\nwho could span a chariot,\nand the people of *Xingyuan*, who were only a *chi* and a half tall—\nhow unequal they are!\nThough an inch is short and a *chi* is long,\nwithout the inch, the *chi* cannot be complete;\nthough a beam is tall and a rafter is short,\nwithout the rafter, the beam cannot stand firm.\nThis is the meaning of contrast—\nthis is certainly speaking of materials.\n\nThe contrast of high and low:\nHeaven is high, earth is low,\nyang ascends, yin descends,\nmountains rise, marshes sink—\nhigh and low are matters of position and force.\nThe higher the position, the higher the force must be;\nthe lower the position, the lower the force must be.\nYet heaven covers below, earth supports above—\nthe two do not topple each other.\nYang is above, yin is below—\nthe two do not topple each other.\nOnly mountains rising and marshes sinking create a contrast—\nmountains rise, marshes sink,\nand if we speak of water, we say:\n*\"A hundred valleys are the source of rivers and streams,\"*\nthen high things descend to the low.\nIf we take this as true,\nthen rivers and streams are the gathering of the valleys.\nAgain, speaking of the contrast of forces,\nhigh banks become valleys,\ndeep valleys become hills—\nthis is the principle of contrast.\nHow so?\nBanks are high.\nWhen banks are hollowed, they become valleys;\nvalleys are depressions.\nDepressions sink and then level out,\nlevel ground rises and becomes hills.\nWho knows that after a thousand years,\nhills will not become banks,\nor banks will not become depressions?\nContrast is always a matter of force.\n\nThe harmony of sounds—this is music.\nRitual guides the mind,\nmusic guides harmony.\nAfter the simplicity of antiquity dispersed,\npeople lost their natural emotions.\nWithout ritual to regulate them, they become disordered;\nwithout music to harmonize them, they are injured.\nThus, the rise of music is the creation of sounds.\nThe *Record of Music* says:\n*\"All sounds arise from the human heart.\nThe heart’s movement is caused by things.\nWhen moved by things, it manifests in sound.\nSounds respond to each other and thus create variation;\nwhen variation is complete, it is called music.\nComparing sounds to create music,\nand using drums, spears, feathers, and flags—this is music.\nMusic is the origin of sound,\nits root in the heart’s response to things.\nThus, when the sorrowful heart is moved,\nits sound is sharp and severe;\nwhen the joyful heart is moved,\nits sound is slow and relaxed;\nwhen the joyful heart is moved,\nits sound bursts forth and scatters;\nwhen the angry heart is moved,\nits sound is coarse and fierce;\nwhen the respectful heart is moved,\nits sound is straight and restrained;\nwhen the worried heart is moved,\nits sound is harmonious and gentle.\nThese six are not innate;\nthey arise only when moved by things.\nThus, the ancient kings were cautious about what moved them,\nso they used ritual to guide their wills,\nmusic to harmonize their sounds,\ngovernment to unify their actions,\nand law to prevent their deceit.\nRitual, music, law, and governance—\nthese are one in purpose.\nThey serve to unify the people’s hearts\nand establish the path of governance.\n\nAll sounds arise from the human heart.\nEmotions move within,\nand thus manifest in sound.\nWhen sound forms patterns, it is called music.\nThus, in a well-ordered age, music is peaceful and joyful,\nand its governance is harmonious.\nIn a chaotic age, music is resentful and angry,\nand its governance is misaligned.\nIn a fallen kingdom, music is sorrowful and reflective,\nand its people are suffering.\nThe way of sound is linked to governance.\n\n*Gong* is the ruler,\n*Shang* is the minister,\n*Jiao* is the people,\n*Zheng* is affairs,\n*Yu* is things.\nIf these five are not disordered,\nthere will be no discordant sounds.\nThe *Lü* and *Yu* correspond to the twelve months.\nThe five tones arise from the five phases,\nthe five phases correspond to the five viscera.\nThe liver governs anger,\nthe lungs govern sorrow,\nthe spleen governs thought,\nthe heart governs joy,\nthe kidneys govern fear.\nSince the five viscera govern differently,\nthe five tones, when resonating, also differ.\nTo summon joy with joy,\nits sound is also joyful.\nTo summon sorrow with sorrow,\nits sound is also sorrowful.\nInner responses meet outer echoes—\nthis is the harmony of emotions and sounds.\n\nThe sounds and tones are spoken through *lǚ* and *lǘ*.\nThe past and future follow one another.\nThe sun’s passage does not return to a former day—\nthe moon’s course governs it.\nThe year’s passage does not return to a former year—\nthe seasons govern it.\nThe shifting of illusions does not return to former illusions—\nthe body marks it.\nThe present’s departure does not return to former presents—\ntime transmits it.\n\nTurning back to view it,\nancient and present stand revealed.\nSpring and summer precede autumn and winter—\nthe four seasons flow without pause,\nnew replacing old, old returning as new,\ncycling endlessly, past and future chasing,\nfortune and calamity leaning upon each other without error,\nform and shadow consoling each other without separation.\nThis is the principle of past and future,\nspoken of in terms of new and old.\n\nObserve how existence and nonexistence generate each other—\nthe transformation of things.\nIf identical, it is emptiness;\nemptiness, then, is vast—\nwhat more is there to appear or vanish?\n\nDifficulty and ease complement each other.\nTo grasp and fill is not as good as leaving it be—\nwhat more is there to fear or grieve?\n\nLength and shortness define each other.\nTheir forms are not uniform—\nthe formless cannot be exhausted by numbers.\nWhich is uniform, which is not?\n\nHigh and low incline toward each other.\nThe exalted is *Huang*, the lowly is *Wang*—\nboth attain the Dao’s place,\none and undivided—\nno thing can displace it.\nWhich inclines, which does not?\n\nFor the harmony of sounds and tones,\nis it not like the great sound that lacks voice,\nwhich hearing cannot penetrate?\nFor the past and future following one another,\nis it not like resting in shadow while the light advances,\nwhich progress cannot distinguish?\n\nIf not one who embodies the Dao and stands above all things,\nwho can partake in this?\n\nThus, the sage knows:\nno thing can truly bind the *Wuji*.\nNext, depart from suffering and uphold the True.\n\n**First, reflect with constancy.**\nTherefore, the sage dwells in non-action.\nThus, the written characters arise in sequence—\nearlier words spoke of the six opposing pairs being unaligned,\nhere dividing the meaning into two gates.\n\nOne: things are unaligned, the six pairs persist.\nTwo: things in mutual dependence find harmony,\nyet through their unalignment, they achieve alignment—\nthis is *having-for* (action).\nTo harmonize through mutual dependence is rigidity.\nAmid unaligned dependence, to stand alone and self-possessed—\nthis is the sage.\nThe sage is one who fulfills their nature.\nTo fulfill one’s nature,\ntalent and Dao merge.\nUnable to fulfill one’s nature,\none may have the sage’s talent but lack the sage’s Dao.\nWith talent but no Dao, one is clever—\ncleverness is artificial.\nWith Dao but no talent, one is plain—\nplainness does not transform.\nOnly when talent and Dao merge is it called *complete virtue*.\nTo adapt to time and respond to change,\nto change without exhaustion,\nthen one can illuminate the Dao of non-action.\nTo illuminate the Dao of non-action,\nto skillfully dwell in non-action;\nto skillfully dwell in non-action,\nto practice the teaching of *wu yan* (non-speech).\n\nAll who dwell within the cosmos\ncannot escape affairs,\nthose in the highest positions\ncannot avoid exertion of the mind.\nFor if mind and affairs run parallel,\nthe principle of non-action is lost.\nIf body and affairs are distant,\nthe ability to dwell well is lost.\nThe sage, seated in one hall,\nsupplies all demands—\nhow could the body be distant from affairs?\nIt must be: *empty the mind and respond to change*.\n\nThough the six pairs come from without,\nby principle, they are fixed within the heart.\nFor the heart gives rise to emotions,\naffairs align with emotions;\nwhen affairs align with emotions,\nthe realm of mutual dependence becomes tangled and confused,\nwithout pause.\nThis is not knowing their fixed nature,\nleaving it to unfold naturally.\nThings have their inherent nature—\nwe follow and govern accordingly.\nThings have their unspoken principles—\nwe remain silent and respond in kind,\nthis is what is called *knowing without action, seeing without clarity*.\n\nHeaven, through non-action, attains clarity—\nthe principle of rewarding virtue and punishing licentiousness is manifest.\nEarth, through non-action, attains tranquility—\nthe sentiment of following Heaven’s law is established.\nThus observed,\nHeaven and Earth—do they have no affairs?\nTo dwell in non-action is all.\n\n**Second, transform things with sincerity.**\nPractice the teaching of *wu yan*.\nThe teaching of *wu yan* is how the sage transforms the world with sincerity.\nTo transform things with sincerity is to observe and transform.\nThe superior transforms the inferior,\nlike wind passing over the earth—\nwhat need for speech?\nZhuangzi said: *Two non-actions merge*—this is it.\n*The Classic of Changes* says: *The sage teaches through the divine method.*\nWhen transformation reaches the divine,\nit is swift without haste, effective without action—\nas Mencius said: *Sagehood beyond knowing is called divine.*\nMoreover, correctness is singular and stops there—\nall my correct things are corrected.\nThus it is said: *When the self is correct, orders need not be given for them to be followed;\nwhen the self is incorrect, even orders will not be obeyed.*\nThese are all teachings of *wu yan*.\n\nYet even so, to transform things with sincerity,\nto lead by example—\nthese are the affairs of governing the world.\nAs for those who call it teaching without virtue,\nthey still bear the intent of earnest instruction—\nperhaps those who do not know *why it is so* are simply following nature.\nWho but the sage can speak of this?\n\nThus, foresight cannot be observed—\nthe poem warning the Duke of Nan warns *Guo Gong*:\n*\"Silk robes and fox-fur garments,\ncomplexion like polished cinnabar—\nthis is your lord!\"*\n\n**Third, the flow of measure is inexhaustible.**\nAll things act yet do not decline.\nEarlier words spoke of the six opposing pairs being unaligned—\nthe sage, with singular insight, awakens,\nshatters illusion, and returns to the True,\ndwelling in the realm of non-action,\nseated amidst the bustle of the world.\nNext, it is said: *All things act yet do not decline*—\nthis reveals the Dao’s function.\n\nWhat is this revealed function?\nNon-action is non-movement.\nNow, all things act—\nfrom where do they come?\nStill, they arise from the non.\nThough it is said that what is born is born of itself,\nwhat transforms transforms of itself—\nthe Dao never takes charge—\nhow then can it be said *not to decline*?\n\n**Yet it is said that there is no refusal—**\nthen the coming is never rejected.\n\nThus, it must be that all things are truly born from the Dao,\nand the sage governs them—\ndoes this not mean they come to him?\n\nWhat concerns me, I must know.\nIn the discussion of *quan* (权) and *shi* (实)—\nall things are *quan* (transient/phenomenal),\nthe sage is *shi* (substantial/true).\nThe true does not shift,\nthe transient reveals it—\nso then, the world belongs to the sage.\n\nThe sage has never possessed the world,\nyet his vast heart accommodates it all,\ncontent and at ease.\nEmpty yet illuminating,\never-responsive yet ever-serene—\nhow then can there be refusal?\n\n**Fourth, transformation arises from nature.**\nBorn yet not possessed.\nEarlier words spoke of action without refusal—\nthis follows the natural order of things,\nletting them arise and transform as they will.\n\nNext, it is said: *born yet not possessed*—\nthe sage empties his heart to respond to things,\nhow could he claim what is born as his own?\n\nThe *I Ching* says: *\"Qián (乾) is stillness, its essence is singular.\"*\nThe heavens and earth contain *yin* and *yang*,\nand *yin* and *yang* give birth to all things.\nThe Dao never takes charge—\ndoes the sage then merely *shī* (尸) it?\n\nThen one knows that the sage governs the Dao yet not things;\nto govern things would only muddle his heart.\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"The Dao does not desire mixing, mixing brings multiplicity.\"*\nIs this not what is meant?\n\nThis all clarifies the principle of **non-action**.\n\nFive, **Not relying on cleverness**.\nDoing yet not claiming credit.\n\nThe first two lines speak of *wuwei*—this speaks of *youwei*, for *wuwei* is the root of *youwei*.\nThe Classic says: *\"Do *wuwei* and nothing remains untamed.\"* Now it clarifies *doing yet not claiming*—meaning one does not boast or take pride.\nWhat was earlier called *\"acting yet not refusing\"*—when things are within proper bounds, the actor cannot refuse.\nNext, *\"born yet not possessed\"*—bringing things to a state of emptiness, hence not claiming what is born as one’s own.\nThis reveals how the sage operates within *wuwei* yet never ceases to act.\n\nFrom *youwei* to *wuwei*, the world is already governed, officials fulfill their duties, ruler and subject, father and son follow their order, friends keep their trust, rites and virtue shine forth, punishments are clear, artisans are complete, the four barbarian lands submit, and the people are settled.\nThe sage, in this, does not claim the merit—then to whom does it belong?\nThe sage acts at first with no intention, completes it with no intention.\nFor all dusty causes are inherently empty, the sage’s heart is but emptiness itself.\nThis is the Dao of the Great Sage.\n\nIf one merely does one thing and calls it *ren*, performs one act and calls it *yi*, then boasts and takes pride before others, this is but the deed of a petty conqueror—how could it compare to the ancient rectification of the world?\n\nSix, **Spiritual transformation leaves no trace**.\nMerit completed, no dwelling upon it—the Dao has no fixed form; it adapts to things as its form.\nAlways without a fixed mind, yet the mind adapts as it acts.\nThe echo arises—whether in sound, in things born, in color, or in holding with hands and walking with feet, in dreams, thoughts, and waking awareness—before one thought fades, another arises. The mind, originally empty of defilements, acts thus. The sage, aware of this, claims nothing.\n\nThus, one who completes merit occupies their station, yet if they do not depart, they cling to the traces of *youwei*.\nClinging to *youwei* leads only to rigidity and stagnation—how could this be the mind of the Daoist?\nIt is said: *\"Once obtained, fear losing it.\"* If one fears losing it, they will stoop to anything.\nHow much more so for the sage who has achieved governance?\nThe sage is not thus.\nThey embody Heaven’s movement, like the four seasons’ cycles—merit completed, they depart, and departing, they leave no attachment.\nThe *I Ching* says: *\"Riding a hollow wooden boat.\"*\nNot only does the departing one act thus, but even while in station, their heart is the same.\nIf it were otherwise, the Dao would have attachment and departure.\nWhat is now called *\"completing merit yet not dwelling\"* is the proper way of advance and retreat.\nThe *I Ching* says: *\"Knowing advance and retreat, survival and perishing, yet not losing one’s proper course—is this not the sage alone?\"*\nThis is the meaning of *Qián’s* (乾) extreme *yang* using the trigrams of Nine.\n*\"Dwelling in the broadest realm of the world\"*—Mencius’ words are true.\n*\"Under a great name, it is hard to remain long\"*—the words of the *Yīyī* (鸱夷子) are true.\n*\"Neither extreme can stand; the middle path requires no fixing\"*—the words of the *Release School* are true.\n*\"Inner observation ignites fire; in the tenth month, the embryo sheds its shell\"*—the words of the True Person are true.\nTo know this—who but the sage could attain it?\n\n「The essence of the heart is no more than this.\nIf it is not so, then the Dao will have attachment and departure.\n\nWhat is called *\"not dwelling\"* is why it does not depart.\nWhat is called *departure*—that is name and position.\nWhat cannot depart—is the independent and unchanging self.\n\n*Dao De Zheng Jing Ji Yi* Volume Five concludes.\n*Dao De Zheng Jing Ji Yi* Volume Six begins.\nMaster *Ning Yuan*’s *Chang De Lu* presents the profound and mysterious observation of virtue.\n\n*Observing Affairs* by *Liu Wei Yong* was compiled and edited,\n*Ding Yi Dong*, a former *Feng Da Fu* (奉大夫), *Tai Fu Si* (太府寺) registrar, and concurrent editor at the *Gong Mi Yuan* (枢密院), verified the text.\n\n**Chapter: The World All Knows**\n\n*Shào Ruò Yú* (邵若愚) said:\n*\"The world all knows, yet the Dao does not depart.\"*\n\nThose who know what the world calls *beauty* and follow it—this is to love what is evil.\nThose who know what the world calls *good* and follow it—this is to do what is not good.\n\nWhy is this?\nTo observe the mutual generation of *having* and *not having*,\nthe interplay of *difficulty* and *ease*,\nthe manifestation of *long* and *short*,\nthe inclination of *high* and *low*,\nthe harmony of *sound* and *voice*,\nthe succession of *before* and *after*—\nthese are the six pairs.\n\nWorldly beings, clinging to beauty and goodness, obstruct themselves with worldly affairs,\ntheir true nature follows external conditions,\nthus generating *eight thousand and four thousand afflictions* (八万四千烦恼).\nHence, they act without intent,\ndo without attachment,\nand thus can align with all things,\ngovern the world,\nand instruct without words.\n\nThough all things arise together,\nthe sage does not distinguish them with speech,\nfearing that the people would develop likes and dislikes.\nThe sage takes no action for himself,\ndemands nothing from the people,\nand relies on *non-action* (無為) to settle them.\nThus, the people do not know the sage’s transformation,\nthough he is their ruler and father,\nhe does not depend on it.\nHis deeds complete, yet he does not dwell upon them.\n\nIt is because he does not dwell in outward traces\nthat his *virtue/power* (德) remains and does not depart.\n\n*Wáng Zhì Rán* (王志然) said:\n*\"The world all knows, yet the Dao does not depart.\"*\n\nGood and evil, right and wrong—\nthese are the ancient and modern methods of *opposing treatment* (對治).\nThe world has universally known them.\n\nYet those who love beauty have evil as their opposite,\nand those who love goodness have ungoodness as their opposite.\n\nIf one knows where beauty, evil, goodness, and ungoodness lie,\nthen the beautiful will reveal itself as beautiful—*I do not know its beauty*;\nthe evil will reveal itself as evil—*I do not know its evil*;\nhow much more so with goodness and ungoodness?\n\nGoodness that is not good,\nbeauty that is not beautiful—\nwhat else could this be but reckless indulgence?\n\nYet goodness that is not good—\nhow could beauty not be beautiful?\nBeauty that is beautiful—\nhow could goodness not be good?\n\nClarity reveals dust and filth,\nmindful clarity distinguishes good and evil—\nyet fools do the opposite.\n\nAs *Zhuāngzi* said: *\"Good and evil, I call them emotions.\"* (是非吾謂之情者)\n\nWhat I call *without emotion*—\nthat the person does not internally harm themselves with likes and dislikes,\nalways following nature without adding to it.\n\nWhy do worldly beings always fall into the realm of opposites,\nunable to escape their confines?\nThey do not lean toward *having*, yet they lean toward *not having*;\nthey do not cling to *form*, yet they cling to *numbers*.\n\nThus, it is said: *having* and *not having*,\n*difficulty* and *ease*,\n*long* and *short*,\n*high* and *low*,\n*sound* and *voice*,\n*before* and *after*.\n\nExamining their origins,\nthey are not without cause—\nthere must be intent behind them.\n\nNot favoring any single thing—this is called *constant not-having*;\nnot neglecting any single thing—this is called *constant having*.\nHence, *having* and *not having* mutually generate.\n\n*Yán Jūn Píng* (嚴君平) said:\n*\"Without ease, one cannot know difficulty;\nwithout difficulty, one cannot know ease.\"*\n\nThe ancients said: *\"First difficulty, then ease\"* (先難而後獲),\nthe *Classics* say: *\"Many easings, many difficulties\"* (多易又多難).\nHence, *difficulty* and *ease* mutually complete.\n\nWithout *short*, one cannot know *long*;\nwithout *long*, one cannot know *short*—\nas the *Commentary* says: *\"Like the measure of a cubit.\"* (若尺寸是已)\n\nWithout *low*, one cannot know *high*;\nwithout *high*, one cannot know *low*—\nas the *Commentary* says: *\"Like mountains and marshes.\"* (若山泽是已)\n\nWithout *voice*, one cannot know *sound*;\nwithout *sound*, one cannot know *voice*.\nThe *Six Pitches* (六律) harmonize,\nthe *Eight Sounds* (八音) accord—\nthis is the *sound* and *voice* that must harmonize.\n\nWithout *after*, one cannot know *before*;\nwithout *before*, one cannot know *after*.\nSpring comes first, followed by summer,\nthe long precedes the short—\nthis is the *before* and *after* that must succeed.\n\nThe six pairs do not depart from their positions,\nyet when viewed by outward traces,\nthey are never the same;\nwhen viewed by the Dao,\nthey are never different.\n\nNot even like the sage governing the world,\nusing the *Way of non-action* (無為之道) to manage it,\nthen nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nHence, *\"I use non-action, yet the people transform themselves\"* (我無為而民自化),\n*\"I instruct with speechless teaching\"* (以不言之教教之天下),\nmaking the people not desire,\nachieving harmony through stillness and silence.\n\nThe world’s spoken and heard teachings,\nits learned and verbose doctrines—\nwhere would they open their mouths?\n\nHence, *\"I love stillness, yet the people align themselves\"* (我好靜而民自正).\n\nThe sage does nothing.\nIf he acts, then all things see what he has done—\nthis is to have something to govern.\n\nIf one is born and yet has something—\nthey have not forgotten themselves.\nIf one acts and yet depends on it—\nthey have something to rely upon.\nIf one’s deeds complete and yet they dwell upon them—\nthey have something to bind themselves to.\n\nOnly by not acting for oneself,\nnot having anything for oneself,\nnot relying upon anything for oneself,\nnot dwelling upon anything for oneself—\ncan one soar with the Dao above all things,\nand remain ever constant, never departing.\n\n*Huáng Mào Cái* (黃茂材) said:\n*\"The world all knows, yet this does not make one good.\"*\n\nThe eyes find beauty in colors,\nthe ears find beauty in sounds,\nthe mouth finds beauty in flavors—\nthis is what the world calls *beauty*.\n\nIf one takes this as beauty,\nwould it not lead to evil?\n\nTo perform one good act is to be good,\nto speak one good word is to be good—\nthough it may not suffice to advance toward the Dao,\nit does not yet reach the level of evil.\n\nHence, *\"This does not make one good.\"* (斯不善已)\n\nWhat the world calls *beauty* is not sufficient to be beauty,\nwhat the world calls *good* is not sufficient to be good.\n\nThen what is truly *beauty* and *good*?\n\nIt is said:\n*\"Without taste, this is what I call beauty.\"*\n*\"To dwell where others find evil, this is what I call good.\"* (處人所惡，斯吾謂之善也)\n\nOnly when one knows this\ncan they then enter the Dao.»\n\nThe Dao arises from the interplay of *having* and *having-not*, manifesting in effortless action through silent teaching.\n\nHaving and having-not oppose each other, thus giving rise to one another;\nDifficulty and ease oppose each other, thus completing one another;\nLength and shortness oppose each other, thus defining one another;\nHeight and lowliness oppose each other, thus inclining one another;\nSound and music oppose each other, thus harmonizing one another;\nBefore and after oppose each other, thus following one another.\n\nAll things under heaven follow this pattern—\nthe Sage blends with humanity amidst them,\nhow could they abandon this principle?\n\nYet observing this truth,\ntheir conduct is *wuwei*, yet their teaching is action.\nThey speak without speaking,\nthus avoiding entanglement with things.\nAll things act without complaint,\nthus they do not depart from this.\n\nWhat fills the space between heaven and earth\nis nothing but *having-not*.\nWho is it that acts? Who is it that gives life? Who is it that does?\nThere must be a silent sovereign guiding this.\n\nThe Dao, though nameless, cannot be named;\nthe Dao, though without trace, cannot be traced.\nThus it is said: *\"Act without complaint.\"*\nBut if one claims to have given life and takes credit for its function,\nor acts and relies on its force,\nthen their understanding of the Dao is shallow.\n\nThe Sage embodies this—\nnot possessing, not relying—\nwhat deeds cannot be accomplished?\nTo complete deeds without claiming them\nis to *\"give birth without possessing, act without relying.\"*\nThus, they align with the Dao and become one,\nomitting nothing, needing no distance from others.\n\nProgram Tai said:\n*\"All under heaven know this, yet it is not good.\"*\nWhat is praised and esteemed is called *beauty*,\nwhat is fitting is called *good*—\nthough *beauty* and *good* are indeed precious,\nthey cannot be made known to all.\n\nI reveal to them what they see,\nyet I hold it in high regard—\nthey will surely imitate it.\nLike a lamb in tiger’s skin,\nit only serves to confuse the truth.\n\nThus, when all under heaven know this as *good* and *beauty*,\nthey fall into what is *not good* and *not beautiful*.\n\nWhen the world values humility,\nthere will be those who secretly seek while publicly declining,\npretending to refuse to fulfill their desires.\nWhen frugality is esteemed,\nthere will be those in tattered robes and broken carriages,\ncarrying their own food in a basket—\nthese are those who deliberately degrade themselves\nto satisfy others’ desires, though not truly so.\n\nBut those who embody the Dao\nconceal their actions without display,\nletting people follow without knowing.\nIn the age of supreme virtue,\npeople love one another without calling it *ren*,\nthey are upright without calling it *yi*—\nthis is its effect.\n\nJust as infants follow calves,\nunaware that following is *filial piety*,\nyet truly merging with it—\nthis is the genuine *filial piety*.\n\nThe Master Lao spoke of the Dao’s naturalness,\nall of this kind.\n\nThus, *having* and *having-not* reach perfect complementarity.\nTrue *beauty* and true *good* exist—\nthis is what is called *having*.\nIf done deceptively, then it is merely *having-not*.\n\nAccumulating thought and action to achieve *beauty* and *good* is difficult,\nbut mimicking their semblance is easy.\nTrue *beauty* does not generate *beauty* but *evil*,\ntrue *good* does not generate *good* but *not-good*.\nWhy?\nBecause accumulating thought and *good* is difficult,\nwhile selling falsehood as truth is easy.\n\nThus, displaying *beauty* and *good* to observe,\ndesiring all under heaven to follow the easy path—\nthey act to supplement what they lack,\nwhile deceiving those who do not know.\nThis principle naturally follows in sequence.\n\nLength and shortness incline toward one another.\nThe heart of vanity and self-aggrandizement is universal.\nThe rulers openly proclaim *beauty* and *good* to the world,\nyet those who lack them feel shame,\nknowing the difficulty—\nwhen they follow the easy path,\nacting to gain what they lack,\ntheir perceived shortcomings become exposed in their striving for superiority,\nthus they prop up their lowliness to topple others’ heights—\nthis is the root of transforming *good* into *evil*, *beauty* into *ugliness*.\n\nSound and music follow one another.\nSound is human voice,\nthe structured form of music.\nWhen the song ascends above,\nthe *pao* and bamboo respond to create harmony—\nthis is how they harmonize.\nAs for their sequence of harmony,\nthey constantly pursue one another.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"I sell it, and they buy it.\"*\nApplying this principle to governance,\nit extends beyond mere harmony of sound and voice.\n\nOne transmits to ten, ten to a hundred—\nthe following of before and after never ceases.\nThus, what the rulers intend\ncannot be made known to all.\n\nThis is the essence of supreme action.\n\nThe Master Lao’s teaching of *wuwei* is vast in scope,\nyet his guidance varies with each matter.\nThis *wuwei* speaks of guiding transformation through action.\nThough the heart discerns right and wrong,\nthe outward appearance remains entirely erased.\n\nThose who describe *beauty* truly hold it in their hearts,\nyet do not reveal their admiration for it;\nthose who are *good* truly hold it in their hearts,\nyet do not display their approval of it.\nIn their actions,\nthey silently act without leaving traces—\nthis is the affair of *wuwei*.\n\nWhy do they do this?\nFor fear that outward intentions,\nonce exposed, will let people habituate to their virtues\nand counterfeit their sincerity.\n\nAs for *\"dwelling\"*—\nthey stand firm here, settled and at ease,\nunburdened by other concerns.\n\nTo teach through silent action:\nCommunication between self and others must rely on speech,\nyet if teaching is proclaimed without explanation,\nhow will people know what to follow?\n\nThis passage warns against the love of outward forms,\nwhere people abandon themselves to falsehood.\n\nTo name this deed as *beauty*,\nto display this person as *good*,\nto manifest in praise and borrowings,\nto spread through decrees—\nwhen people follow what is called *beauty* and *good*,\nand imitate their semblance,\nthen the original *true beauty* and *true good*\nwill all turn into mere pretense.\n\nLaozi thus examined the origins of this falsity and reversed it. Within, the mechanism of spontaneous transformation never ceases, yet outwardly, no signs of suppression or elevation are shown. Thus, those who drift between these states cannot know what to follow to ascend. Therefore, he says, *\"The Dao does not enlighten the people; it seeks to make them simple.\"*\n\nThis is the essence of teaching without words.\n\nBut when distinctions of rank are established between teachers and disciples, and precedence is drawn between those born first and last, then even the silent teaching—though profound as the abyss—resounds like thunder.\n\nAll things arise and achieve great deeds without claiming them.\n*\"Arising\"* means to stir and uphold the teaching.\n*\"Generating\"* is like gentle movement, nurturing life—teaching takes root in people, and goodwill begins to sprout, for this is how it gives birth.\n*\"Doing\"* refers to the realm of action, while *\"achievement\"* belongs to those who transform the world through self-so and self-receiving, returning its effects to the Dao.\n\nThe affairs of *wuwei* and the teaching of *non-speech* are not private rules set in every household. Instead, they embrace the vast indifference of Heaven and Earth, governing the four seas with a single touch.\n\nAll who can arise and respond to the teaching are welcomed—none are ever rejected or declined.\n*\"To the good, I am good; to the ungood, I am also good\"*—this is called *not declining*.\n\nWhen goodwill begins to sprout and the teaching takes effect, yet one still refuses to claim credit, this is *not possessing and not relying*.\n\nWhen action, generation, and doing all reach completion, the deed is fulfilled—yet it is abandoned without attachment, as if one had never been involved. Ah! How vast this is.\n\nBefore completion, it is taken as one’s responsibility; when completed, it is not claimed as one’s achievement. This is why the Great Dao does not seek to establish virtue.\n\nOnly what is utterly unceasing endures. All that is formed must eventually decay, all that is numbered must eventually exhaust—thus, all that exists tends toward nonexistence. How then can departure be retained?\n\nBut if achievement is completed without claiming it, it is as if it never existed. What belongs to the Dao cannot be depleted or destroyed—how then can it depart?\n\nThe flowers of spring declare their own virtue in blooming, so their splendor can be replaced. The fruits of autumn take responsibility for gathering and refining, so their harvest can fall. But the Original Qi moves beyond the four seasons, generating without being generated, transforming without being transformed—thus enduring eternally through the ages. This, having neither attachment nor departure, is called *\"from ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, as it oversees all things.\"*\n\nConfucian scholars lament that the people are difficult to awaken, while Laozi laments that they are not simple enough. Hence, he says, *\"The people are difficult to govern because they are too clever,\"* and *\"When the people have many sharp tools, the state grows confused.\"* Yet when speaking of his own approach, he says, *\"The Dao does not enlighten the people; it seeks to make them simple,\"* and *\"Fish cannot be lifted from the depths, nor can the state’s sharp tools be displayed before the people.\"*\n\nPursuing this logic, those who fiercely condemn sagely wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness, desiring to abandon their implements, do not truly oppose these virtues themselves. For he says, *\"Wisdom and insight, when overdeveloped, breed great falsity,\"*—this is the root of his corrective intent.\n\nIndeed, the establishment of rites and laws began with Xuanyu and Yao. Their creation was meant to supplement the simplicity of knotted cords. But once their simplicity was seen as deficient, those who followed inevitably leaned toward excess. When excess grew, institutions and mechanisms spread until they became overt and exposed—then the clever among the people, seeing them, also began to manipulate them. Thus, the sage could use wisdom to restrain the people, while the people could use their cleverness to disrupt the laws.\n\nThis is why Laozi blamed the proliferation of wisdom and sought to correct it with *wuwei*. He feared that enlightening the people would spawn falsity and sought to correct it with *wuji* (non-tracing).\n\nFor rivers fill while valleys empty, hills level while depths fill—once opposites arise, neither can dominate. Thus, sagely wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness must inevitably fall into the realm of abandonment.\n\nYet Laozi, though he ultimately rejects them, still employs them to embody the Dao—so what he truly condemns is not their essence, but the propagation of sharp tools to enlighten the people.\n\nExamining these two passages closely, is it not clear?\n\nWhen he says *\"do not exalt the worthy,\"* he does not mean all are equal in merit—only that he refuses to display them openly. He warns against the danger of erecting grand structures to attract those who seek fame.\n\nWhen the world knows beauty and goodness as beauty and goodness, then entering the realm of *not-beauty* and *not-goodness* is also a silent operation, preventing people from rushing into pretense and false imitation.\n\nYet when teachers and disciples are both employed, with distinctions of high and low, and when movement and stillness are both established, with emotions stirring naturally—though outwardly appearing inclusive, inwardly there remains discrimination.\n\nHe governs the world with an all-encompassing public stance, yet within, he employs subtle mechanisms to move the hearts of people. This method stems from the *Yijing*’s principle of *\"manifesting in virtue, concealing in use.\"* The manifest refers to what can be demonstrated; the concealed refers to the profound, inscrutable source of transformation.\n\nThough rites, music, punishments, and governance have been established as tools of governance, the concern remains that people can be made to follow without truly understanding. Thus, those who grasp the totality of the Dao to craft these tools—even if they wished to reveal it—could find no way to do so.\n\n「Thus, the *Yijing*’s principle of *concealing in use* reaches its ultimate expression in *entering the divine* (入神). *Entering the divine* means moving without haste yet swiftly, acting without effort yet arriving with perfect effect. This is precisely what the Old Master (老氏) imitated when he spoke of *\"non-action yet nothing left undone\"* (无为而无不为).\n\nYet, he altered the phrasing, merely applying it as a means to establish his own doctrine. Scholars dare not use this to critique the *Yijing*, but instead all employ it as a basis to condemn the Old Master, which is a matter of unclear judgment indeed.\n\nHowever, his methods of implementation do not entirely diverge from the *Yijing*, and this cannot be concealed. The *Yijing* seeks to *manifest in virtue* (显诸仁) yet fails, thus lamenting the common folk’s ignorance, unable to align them with the *virtue of the wise and the enlightened* (仁智之有见).\n\nThe Old Master, however, directly aims to deceive them, waiting until they are *without knowledge and without desire* (无知无欲), before he then *takes and seizes* (取歙张) them, emerging from within. Here lies their difference.\n\nZhan Qiupu (詹秋圃) said: *\"All under Heaven know ‘the utmost’ yet do not attain it.\"* In the chapter on *Nurturing the Body* (养身), he first seeks to *forget oneself in the realm of unknowing and unrecognizing* (不识不知之表), yet ultimately desires *contraries giving rise to each other* (相反相成), without magnifying his own greatness to dwell in the greatness of all under Heaven.\n\nHence, it is said: *\"All under Heaven know beauty as beauty, goodness as goodness; yet this very pursuit of beauty and goodness may lead to perversion and distortion, resulting in evil and wickedness.\"* The pairing of *\"good deeds\"* (善事) and *\"action\"* (为) reflects how opposites generate each other and reach their extreme in mutual dependence. The rise and fall of each arise from their kind, thus the Sage acts in *non-action* (无为), teaches through *non-speech* (不言), entrusting all things to *this generates that* (此作彼应) without complaint. He gives life yet does not possess it, acts yet does not claim it—though his deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell upon them, but rather *pushes them away* (推之) and they do not depart.\n\nIndeed, those who excel in *nurturing the body* (养身) can *retire after success* (功成身退), thereby *dwelling in security and deepening their roots* (居安资深), and would never lose their *shoulders and backs* (肩背) for the sake of it.\n\nZhang Chongying (张冲应) replied: *\"All under Heaven know ‘the utmost’ yet do not attain it.\"* The Dao abhors excess and upholds humility (谦).\n\nThough talent is beautiful, those who are praised for their beauty will ultimately *arouse envy* (起妬). Though virtue is good, those who are praised for their virtue will ultimately *spark contention* (起争). Envy harms the body, contention harms the body as well. Thus, Pang Juan (庞涓) flaunted his talent and fell into the *tree’s shadow disaster* (树下之失), while Han Xin (韩信) coveted his name and met his end in the *Cloud Dream purge* (云梦之诛). These are matters unworthy of discussion with the *mysterious Dao* (玄道).\n\nThe Sage, when he emerges, does not rely upon his unique talents, but instead harbors the mind of *seeing action in non-action* (见有为无). He does not grudge the difficulty of his accomplishments, but rather holds the thought of *seeing difficulty as ease* (见难为易).\n\nWhen others are short and I extend them, their shortness is covered by my length—thus it is said, *contraries form each other* (相形). When others are high and I humble myself beneath them, their height is suppressed by my lowliness—thus it is said, *contraries topple each other* (相倾).\n\nWhen one responds and the other resonates, their voices harmonize; when one leads and the other follows, above and below align naturally. The Sage governs through *non-action* and teaches through *non-speech*, using the Dao to regulate his body and his body to elucidate the Dao. His true heart is steadfast.\n\nAll things arise, yet his mind remains unperturbed—*desires are extinguished* (贪心绝矣). All things are born, yet he does not possess them—*his will can act yet does not indulge in its own doing* (志可为而不逞所为). Though his deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell in their position—thus Zhang Liang (子房) attained swiftness in *Red Pine’s wandering* (赤松之游速), and Zhongli Quan (锺离权) achieved leisure in *Jade Cavern’s departure* (玉洞之去忙), all through this cultivation.\n\nWith this cultivation, *vital essence endures* (精长固), *qi remains stored* (气长存), *spirit stays clear* (神长清), and thus the body *long-lives* (身长生). *Blessings and virtue* (福德) reside within yet do not depart.\n\nBai Yu Chan (白玉蟾) said: *\"All under Heaven know beauty as beauty, goodness as goodness; those who seek fame in beauty and goodness, though they attain beauty and goodness, cannot escape the rise of evil. Those who seek to be called ‘good,’ though they perform good deeds and benefit others, ultimately become wicked.\"*\n\nHence, *having and non-having generate each other*—non-having must generate having, having must generate non-having. *Difficulty and ease complete each other*—first difficult, then easy; first easy, then difficult again. *Length and shortness form each other*—the Dao itself is formless, yet through self-extension, length and shortness arise. *High and low topple each other*—Heaven revolves, Earth turns; originally there is no high or low.\n\n*Voices harmonize*—when one wind sounds, all ten thousand echoes respond. *Front and back follow each other*—the past is the present, the present is the past.\n\nThus, the Sage governs through *non-action* and values *naturalness* (自然). He teaches through *non-speech* and the Dao is embodied in things. All things arise from this, yet he does not refuse it.\n\nNon-having must generate having—how could it not generate? If it did not generate, how could it endure long? He gives life yet does not possess it—non-having is merely false illusion. He acts yet does not claim it—*today is today alone* (今日今日而已). Though his deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell upon them—*how could it compare with reality, to dream of it?*\n\nOnly in *not dwelling* (弗居) does he *forget the external yet not forget the internal*—thus it is said, *it does not depart* (不去). *One self remains stored* (一我自存).\n\nLiao Cuiran (廖粹然) said: *\"All under Heaven know goodness as goodness; people take color, sound, fragrance, flavor, and physical form (触法) as their objects of attachment, indulging in joy, anger, love, hatred, sorrow, delight, and desires to make them their ‘strong goods’ (强美). I know this is not so.*\n\nWhy is this not so? Because *this very attachment is the root of evil* (斯恶已). Thus, those who love affairs are plagued by *demons* (魔), the *Seven Emotions* (七情) assault from within, the *Six Bandits* (六贼) invade from without, and all desires ultimately harm the body. I habitually remain *serene and indifferent* (恬憺无为), considering *learning the Dao and attaining the Dao* (学道得道) as the true ‘strong goods’—is this not beautiful?\n\nAll under Heaven know goodness as goodness, yet they also believe that goodness is the most joyous. Some perform good deeds, aid others, and benefit all things—these are all considered good actions. *I see otherwise*—why is this so?\n\n「This is not virtue—why is this so? People are not Yao or Shun, yet some, before doing good deeds, first seek reward, bribing the superiors to keep their hearts. Others, when they have done good, fear it was not fully complete, and regret their efforts. I have practiced *clearing and quieting* (清静) to cultivate *awareness* (定慧), *calming the heart and nurturing the spirit* (安心养神), and thus regard *upholding the Dao and achieving its fulfillment* (守道而成功) as the supreme virtue—is this not joyous?\n\nHence, *the interplay of presence and absence* (有无相生) arises—this speaks of the *marvelous application of virtue and Dao* (道德妙用). *Difficulty and ease interdepend* (难易相成), marking the *beginning of transformation* (造化始端). *Length and shortness contrast* (长短相形), revealing the *substance and measure* (器质法度) of things. *High and low incline* (高下相倾), as Heaven and Earth undergo their ceaseless changes (变通). *Sounds harmonize* (音声相和), carried by winds and breaths (风气吹嘘). *Past and future follow* (前后相随), giving rise to the *birth and evolution of all things* (古今生化). These are all *the Dao’s marvels* (道妙), inexhaustible in their depth. Therefore, the sage *Laozi* (太上老子), known by the name of *Dao-attainment* (得道), is also called *Great Supreme* (大上), *Sage* (圣人), *the Virtuous One* (有道之士), *the Ruler of Men* (人主), *the Daoist* (道者), *the Lord of the Heart* (心君), or *the Great Man* (大丈夫)—each title fitting the occasion. To dwell in *non-action* (无为之事) is the *root principle* (根本). To practice *teaching without words* (行不言之教), the *Great Supreme* says:\n\n*\"Silent, silent, silent—\nwithout bound, the Dao’s transcendent ones are born from this.\"*\n\nAll things act without claiming merit (作而不辞). The common folk use them daily, yet do not know they are my Dao. *To give birth without possession* (生而不有), *to transform endlessly* (生化无穷). *To act without reliance* (为而不恃), *to bestow kindness without seeking reward* (施恩而不望报). *To complete deeds without dwelling on them* (功成弗居), *to bring forth all things yet not lord over them* (生成万物而不为主). Only by *not dwelling on them* (弗居), *doing so out of self-love yet not arrogating superiority* (自爱而不自贵), is it that *they are never abandoned* (是以不去). Enduring from ancient times to the present, without beginning or end (亘古亘今，无来无去).\n\n*Chen Bi Xu* (陈碧虚) said: All under Heaven know that virtue is not exhausted here—why is this so? For all under Heaven (天下者) refers to the *general scope* (举大凡而言) of everything beneath Heaven’s canopy (凡在天覆之下也). Virtue and goodness arise from *delusive emotions* (妄情). Ordinary people take what their emotions favor as good and what they reject as evil. If one indulges in *delusive emotions* (纵己妄情), what is not evil? They take what they affirm as good and what they deny as not good. If one indulges in *judgments of right and wrong* (纵己是非), how can there be true goodness?\n\n*Zhuangzi* (庄子) said: Right and wrong are what I call *emotion* (情也). What I call *non-emotion* (无情者) is that people do not let their likes and dislikes internally harm their bodies; they follow their natural state without adding artificiality (常因自然而不益生也). This is called *stopping at what is truly fitting* (止於实当也).\n\nThe Sage, then, has virtue and goodness—yet they do not boast of them, making them equal to none. *Not boasting preserves their virtue* (不矜则德全), *equaling none keeps harm at bay* (同於无则害远). When virtue is complete and harm is distant, virtue and goodness are fully realized (美善尽矣). If rulers use virtue and goodness to transform all under Heaven, making them know virtue as virtue, this is not yet complete goodness. Hence, I say the *Book of Martial Virtue* (《武》) is fully beautiful, yet not fully virtuous (未尽善也). The *Classic* (《经》) says: *\"The supreme virtue does not claim virtue* (上德不德), *the lesser virtue does not lose virtue* (下德不失德也).\"\n\nMoreover, virtuous people are few, while the unvirtuous are many. If one flaunts their virtuous deeds, stealing and mocking them, this is already evil—how can it be called virtue?\n\n*Yan Jun Ping* (严君平) said: Clarity does not always endure, darkness does not always prevail. Honor and decay begin at the *Spring Equinox* (仲春), *qí mài* (荠麦) and *yáng wù* (阳物) emerge at the *Autumn Equinox* (秋分). On the *Winter Solstice* (冬至), all things flourish and thrive (滋滋), while on the *Summer Solstice* (夏至), all things wither and lament (愁悲). It speaks of how even at their peak, things must decline, and beauty must yield to evil (盛叉有衰，美必有恶). If this is true of *yin and yang* (阴阳), how much more so for humanity? This is a warning against *boasting of virtue and goodness* (矜夸美善者也).\n\nThus, from *the interplay of presence and absence* (有无之相生) to *the following of past and future* (前后之相随), these six principles arise—*because boasting of virtue and goodness leads to active interference* (因矜美善动入有为), *and once interference is evident, partiality and fixation emerge* (有为既彰，偏执斯起). Partiality and fixation breed mutual destruction (残贼互生), and things lose their nature (物失其性). Hence, the Sage’s *non-action* (无为) and *profound virtue* (渊德) remain unyielding (不去).\n\nThe interplay of presence and absence (有无之相生) is that *presence and absence inherently do not generate each other*—yet *to speak of presence, it must arise from absence*, and *to discuss absence, it must be born from presence*—hence, *presence and absence interdepend* (故曰有无之相生).\n\nDifficulty and ease interdepend (难易之相成者也): It is that *difficulty and ease inherently do not form each other*—yet *like the potter, who finds clay easy to shape yet wood difficult*, or *the carpenter, who finds wood easy to work yet clay difficult*, *each finds what is easy in their own craft, yet difficulty emerges where it diverges*—thus, *difficulty and ease interdepend* (故曰难易之相成也).\n\nLength and shortness contrast (长短之相刑者): It is that *length and shortness inherently do not define each other*—yet *when one sees a crane, one knows the mallard’s legs are short*, and *when one sees a mallard, one knows the crane’s legs are long*. By this mutual reference, all things are so—hence, *length and shortness contrast* (故曰长短之相形也).」\n\nAn inch is short by a foot’s measure, a foot is long by an inch’s standard;\nMountains crumble by valleys’ contrast, valleys tilt by mountains’ rise;\nSounds distinguish by tones’ contrast, tones cease by sounds’ accord;\nWhat comes later is seen through what precedes, what follows is known through what comes first.\n\nThus, without the void, the manifest cannot be seen;\nWithout the manifest, the void cannot be known;\nWithout difficulty, ease cannot be discerned;\nWithout ease, difficulty cannot be understood;\nWithout length, shortness cannot be measured;\nWithout shortness, length cannot be defined;\nWithout mountains, valleys cannot be known;\nWithout valleys, mountains cannot be revealed;\nWithout tones, sounds cannot be distinguished;\nWithout sounds, tones cannot be heard;\nWithout what precedes, what follows cannot be grasped;\nWithout what follows, what precedes cannot be fathomed.\n\nAll these principles—\nHeaven and Earth’s verifications, Nature’s immutable signs—\nAre laid bare, neither concealed nor denied,\nTheir beginning and end cyclically reversing,\nUnseparable, beyond even the divine’s evasion,\nYin and Yang cannot defy them.\n\nThus observed, the affairs of the Sage-King cannot be forced by contrivance.\nTherefore, the Sage practices the teaching of *non-action* in conduct.\n\nThis speaks of the ancient Sage-King,\nWho did not govern the world with artificial virtue,\nYet the world governed itself.\nThus, *\"is with\"* explains the lower to clarify the higher.\n\n*Non-action* is not idle withdrawal into empty halls,\nBut the Sage forgetting all virtues, extinguishing emotions, restoring innate nature,\nSo the people act according to their capacities,\nThings settle into their proper order,\nAnd above and below remain undisturbed.\nThus, it is said: *\"to dwell in non-action.\"*\n\nTo practice the teaching of *non-speech* means\nTo lead by personal example, rectify conduct, and intuitively respond to circumstances,\nActing in season, leveraging resources, achieving results without deliberate speech—\nThus, *\"to practice the teaching of non-speech.\"*\n\nWhen all things act, the Sage does not claim credit.\n*Action* means movement.\nThe Sage governs the world in effortless ease,\nDoing nothing, yet the people till and eat,\nWeave and clothe themselves,\nContent with suckling, joyful with full bellies,\nPlaying without aim—\nDelighting in their natural endowments,\nAll movements virtuous, the transformation of *non-action*.\n\nThus, the Sage entrusts them without interference.\nThe people can be led but not made to understand—\nThis is the wind of the Supreme Virtue’s *non-virtue*.\n\nBorn yet not possessing, achieving yet not dwelling.\nAll things generate spontaneously, each in its own transformation,\nNot claimed as one’s own, yet all striving fulfills its nature,\nNot relying on personal merit—\nWhen deeds are complete and affairs settled,\nThe Way is realized in things,\nThe mind wanders at Maoshu’s peaks,\nNot lording over the people—\nThis is the Sage’s complete virtue.\n\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart.\nThe Sage’s deeds align with Nature’s creation,\nEnsuring all things reach their utmost,\nYet forgets name and self.\n\n*Not dwelling* means not claiming rank or treasure as one’s own,\nSo the people remain unaware, unknowing—\nThus, the Way does not perish, virtue does not fade.\n\n*The Honglie Explanation* says:\nWhen Chu’s General Zi Fa attacked Cai Yu, King Xuan of Qin welcomed him at the capital,\nGranting him a hundred *mu* of land and the ceremonial jade tablet of a high official.\nZi Fa declined, saying:\n*\"To govern a state and establish policies, to receive visiting lords—\nThis is the king’s virtue.\nTo issue commands and the enemy flees before battle—\nThis is the general’s might.\nTo array troops and defeat the foe—\nThis is the common soldier’s strength.\nTo ride upon the people’s labor and take their rewards—\nThis is not the Way of Ren and Yi.\"*\nThus, he declined and did not accept.\n\nHence, *\"achieving yet not dwelling\"*—\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart.\n\nXie Tusou said:\nAll under Heaven know what is supremely good.\nWhen the Sage governs the world,\nGood governance and fine transformations penetrate the hearts of the people,\nYet they do not recognize them as such.\nLater generations implement a policy or decree, and the people call it good;\nThey establish a benefit or remove a harm, and the people praise it—\nThis is not impossible,\nYet what is manifest to all may not touch their hearts.\n\nThus, the unknowing are deeply moved,\nWhile the knowing barely acknowledge it—\nThe profound is hard to exhaust, the shallow easily exposed.\nIf it is easily exposed,\nThen the shift from good to evil, from virtue to vice,\nIs but a turn of the hand—\nHence the warning against *having* and *not having*, *difficulty* and *ease*—\nIts meaning is profound.\n\nThus, *having* and *not having* are inseparably linked.\nWithout level, there is no slope;\nWithout forward, there is no return.\nThe Sage alone ensures that what is called *good* is not evil,\nThat what is called *virtue* is not vice.\n\nWithout life, there is no death;\nDeath gives rise to life again.\nDifficulty becomes ease, ease becomes difficulty;\nLength and shortness, height and low—\nMutually contrasted, tilted, reversing, ever-changing,\nWith no fixed beginning.\n\nLike sounds moving to tones’ harmony,\nOr what precedes guiding what follows—\nThis is the necessary logic, the inevitable course.\n\nThus, the Sage’s virtue is never lost.\nThe Sage knows the world’s nature is ever-shifting,\nSo he follows Nature’s spontaneous order,\nActs without contrivance,\nTeaches without speech—\nYet when called *good* or *beautiful*,\nWho can truly know?\n\nWhen things must act, the Sage does not shirk responsibility;\nWhen things must be born, the Sage does not claim the benefit;\nDoing without doing, yet not relying on ability;\nAchieving without achieving, yet not dwelling on success—\nAll under Heaven find their proper place,\nWhile the Sage seems uninvolved.\n\nYet though he does not dwell on his deeds,\nWhere would the world turn without the Sage?\nThe Sage has no designs on the world,\nYet the world cannot be without the Sage.\n\nThis is why it was the age of ancient Sage-Kings.\nIndeed, examining it:\nThe rise and fall of ages, the waxing and waning of human nature and things—\nHow unequal they are!\n\nThe *Tai* yielding to *Pi*, *Yi* to *Sun*,\n*Sue* to *Jian*, *Ji* to *Wei*—\nThe *Yi* has already spoken of this.\nYet the Sage comprehends these transformations,\nDivinizes their changes,\nEver guiding the people through tireless motion,\nMoving them in the realm of the unknown—\nThus, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun\nGoverned with effortless ease,\nYet the world was in harmony,\nAnd all things flourished without decree.\n\n「Later generations adorned their actions as achievements,\nAnd twisted their ways to display their abilities,\nBoasting virtues and flaunting beauty—\nYet how could they fail to unsettle the people’s ears and eyes?\nIt is like cutting colored silk to claim elegance,\nOr drawing water to feign depth.\nThe intent of nurturing and propagating life does not dwell within them,\nAnd their downfall comes swiftly and surely.\nHow could they ever be considered models of perfect virtue and beauty?\n\nLin Yongzai remarked: *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling to it.*\nThis chapter embodies the principle of *having while not possessing*.\n\nWhere there is beauty, there is ugliness;\nWhere there is virtue, there is vice.\nBeauty unknown as beauty,\nVirtue unknown as virtue—\nThen there is no ugliness, no vice.\n\nFor all things in the world,\nThere is presence and absence,\nDifficulty and ease,\nLength and brevity,\nHeight and low,\nSound and voice,\nFront and back.\nThe six lines of *mutual generation and completion*\nAll metaphorically illustrate the paired opposites of beauty and ugliness,\nVirtue and vice.\n\nThus, the Sage acts without action,\nSpeaks without words—\nNever shirking emptiness as idle,\nNor fearing excess as laborious,\nBut simply completing the task without claiming it.\n\nLike the heavens and earth nurturing myriad things,\nThrough endless transformations and changes,\nPursuing one another without end—\nDid they ever cease their toil?\nAll things flourish under heaven and earth,\nYet heaven and earth never claim them as their own.\nLike spring and summer, life and death,\nCreation’s work never relies on them as proof of its power.\nThus, they give birth without possession,\nAct without reliance—\nTheir intent lies solely in *completing the task without claiming it*.\n\nHence, the three lines: *All things act, yet they do not claim to be the originators.*\n*—作* (zuò) is akin to the *Yijing*’s *Kūn* (坤), which \"acts to complete things.\"*\nThis reflects Shun and Yu’s *receiving the Mandate of Heaven yet not taking it as their own*.\n\nFrom ancient times, all Sages were thus—\nWhy single out Laozi?\n\nOnly by *not claiming* does one *not lose*.\nThose who possess what they have cannot truly have it,\nWhile those who do not claim what they possess can truly have it.\nThese eight characters hold profound meaning.\nThe *Shū* (书) says: *He who has virtue yet loses virtue*—\nThis is its very essence.\n\nWhen sound harmonizes with form, it is called *music*—\nHence, *sound and voice in accord*.\n\nFan Yingyuan noted: *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling to it.*\n*—至* (zhì) is pronounced *yǐ* (以), a grammatical particle.\nSince ancient times, Sages have embodied this Dao in their dealings with affairs—\nTheir way of attaining perfect beauty and virtue,\nYet people unaware of their true beauty and virtue,\nIs that affairs unfold naturally,\nEach with its proper course.\n\nThus, the Sage follows nature’s logic,\nActs with measured harmony,\nNever boasting or claiming credit for beauty or virtue.\nIf one boasts of beauty or claims virtue,\nAnd makes all under Heaven aware of it—\nThen ugliness and vice must surely follow.\nHence, *presence and absence generate and follow one another.*\n\nThis further confirms the opposites of beauty and ugliness,\nVirtue and vice.\nTherefore, the Sage’s *uttermost teaching*.\n\nThe Sage’s *uttermost teaching*—\nThis is the meaning of *continuing from above to below*.\nThe Sage, pure in the Dao,\nAlso called *the great and transformative*—\nAll that follows does likewise.\n\nTo dwell in *non-action* is to embody the Dao—\nThe Dao is ever *non-acting* yet never *not acting*,\nAnd the Sage remains empty-hearted while responding to things.\n\nTo practice *unsaid teaching* is to align with Heaven—\nHeaven speaks not, yet\nThe four seasons pass in its course,\nAnd myriad creatures flourish in its embrace.\nThe Sage follows principle to benefit all,\nNothing left unaligned—\nThis is the *unsaid teaching*.\n\n*All things act, yet they do not claim to be the originators*—\nThe ancient texts, as per Wang Bi and Yang Xu, agree.\n\n*—作* (zuò) is motion.\nSilent and still, yet sensing and thus fully responsive—\nThis is the Dao.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao in establishing things,\nResponds only after being moved,\nThus, *they do not claim to be the originators*.\n\nFrom *giving birth without possession* to *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling*—\nFu Yi remarked: *The ancient texts all read \"dwell\" (处).*\nAll things’ generation, propagation, and movement\nArise from the Dao.\nYet the Dao never claims them as its own,\nNor relies on them for its power—\nUntil the task is complete, it never dwells on it.\nOnly by *not dwelling on the task’s completion*\nDoes one ensure that things do not resist.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao in standing,\nThus also *they give birth without possession*—\nHow could ugliness and vice follow?\n\nXue Yongzai said: *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling*—\n*To the paired opposites of front and back.*\n\nWhere there is beauty, there is ugliness;\nWhere there is virtue, there is vice—\nNo affair in the world lacks its counterpart.\nThese six are but one corner of the whole.\n\nYanzi’s *\"As if standing firm upon something\"*—\nSurely there are opposites to it.\n\nTherefore, the Sage’s *uttermost teaching*.\n*—作而不为* (zuò ér bù wéi) is the affair of *non-action*,\n*—言而不言* (yán ér bù yán) is the teaching of *no words*—\nThe Sage thus transcends all opposites.\n\nHeaven and earth are *unbenevolent*,\nTreating myriad things as *straw dogs*.\nThe Sage conforms to and mirrors them.\nOnly by *not claiming* does one *not lose*—\nIn their lack of dwelling, they also lack nothing to abandon.\n\nResting in the *Resting Pavilion* (休休庵) remarked:\n*All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling*—\n*To the paired opposites of front and back.*\n\nThe Three Powers established,\nMyriad things born,\nRadiance and luster flourish,\nNames and forms appear.\nCommon folk know myriad things’ beauty,\nTheir utility in sustaining life—\nYet those who prize it fail to recognize the nurturing grace,\nThis is called *ugliness*.\n\nEven if all know that creation’s movement,\nLife and death’s unfolding,\nIs virtue—\nThose who take this as virtue\nOnly see the Three Powers’ *virtue/power*,\nYet fail to grasp the great Dao,\nThis is called *vice*.\n\nAlas! To be blind to the Dao and lost in virtue,\nTo chase superficial ends while forgetting the root—\nDay by day, their corruption deepens.\n\nThough humans are the most enlightened,\nThey cannot reflect upon their original,\nPure, luminous, and wondrous nature—\nEndowed with great *divine penetration*,\nCapable of mastering all phenomena,\nPossessing *non-action’s wondrous efficacy*—\nYet they pursue illusions and vie in *action*,\nTheir emotions and perceptions ensnared,\nBound by the Five Desires and Eight Winds,\nTheir greed, anger, delusion, and attachment wreaking havoc.\n\nThe Dao/Way gives rise to existence from non-existence,\nExistence gives rise to non-existence,\nNon-existence and existence mutually generate endlessly.\n\nWhat is done in the world,\nSome is difficult, some is easy—\nDifficult things bring forth suffering,\nEasy things bring forth joy,\nAnd suffering and joy, difficulty and ease,\nMutually arise and fulfill one another.\n\nActions have virtue and vice,\nPrinciples have strengths and weaknesses—\nStrengths and weaknesses contrast,\nAnd thus power has highs and lows,\nMutually inclining and countering one another.\nGood and bad, sounds and tones,\nIntermingle and blend,\nRight and wrong,\nOne has not yet ceased,\nThe other follows in its wake—\nWho would resolutely reflect,\nReturning to simplicity,\nRestoring to purity?\n\nThus the Sage dwells in non-action’s Dao/Way,\nYet never departs from it.\n\nThe Sage is one who comprehends the great Dao,\nAnd broadens ultimate virtue/power.\n\nThe Master [Buddha] said:\n*\"Sever desire, abandon love,\nKnow the heart, attain the root,\nAwaken to non-action’s dharma,\nInternally gain nothing,\nExternally seek nothing—\nThe heart does not cling to the Dao,\nNor does it bind to karma.\nWithout thought, without action,\nNeither practice nor attainment,\nNot passing through all stages,\nYet naturally exalted,\nThis is called the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Dao of non-action\nUnites myriad virtues,\nDissolves collective confusion,\nResponds to circumstances,\nAids the faltering,\nSupports the endangered,\nWith wondrous natural efficacy.\n\nLike spring moving through all lands,\nWind sweeping the boundless void.\n\nThose who attain the great Dao\nDo not boast of action’s achievements,\nBut trust in non-action’s Dao,\nWith virtue’s natural harmony,\nEqual to all of existence—\nWithout words, people transform themselves.\nCultivating the self, harmonizing the family,\nGovern the state, bring peace to the world—\nNever for a moment can one depart from the Dao.\n\nThose who take the Dao as their essence,\nTheir virtue/power aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nLofty, bright, vast, and profound,\nAll things arise together yet they do not reject them,\nNurturing all things without claiming ownership,\nMastering all phenomena without relying on their eminence,\nGreat deeds accomplished yet they do not dwell in their position.\n\nOnly those who do not dwell in great deeds,\nNor rule over others,\nAre without loss.\n\nWithout honor or disgrace,\nThey transcend right and wrong.\n\nAbandoning is losing.\nChu Bo-xiu said:\n*\"All know the Dao’s utmost extent,\nYet fail to depart from it.\"*\n\nExternally in things,\nThere are beauties and virtues—\nAll know and delight in them;\nInternally in oneself,\nThere are true beauties and true virtues—\nFew know and do not pursue them.\n\nBeauty and virtue arise from human desire,\nYet sometimes they are not beautiful nor virtuous.\nTrue beauty and true virtue root in Heaven’s principle,\nEverlasting through ages, ever beautiful and ever virtuous.\n\nWhat the world calls good or bad,\nRight or wrong,\nAll belong to deluded emotions—\nOne’s \"right\" is another’s \"wrong.\"\nWho can truly grasp the proper?\n\nBorn from the six pairs of opposites,\nThey spread endlessly—\nLike the rise and fall of yin and yang,\nOr the waxing and waning of existence and non-existence;\nDifficulty and ease, deeds and failures—\nThe crane’s height reveals the duck’s shortness,\nThe mountain’s grandeur shows the marsh’s lowliness;\nSound emerges, yet tone arises,\nSpring precedes, summer follows—\nEven these mutually arising and fulfilling opposites\nCannot forever preserve beauty and virtue,\nHow much more so when they contrast and incline against one another?\n\nThe Sage investigates the origins,\nRescues defects,\nLeading by example—\nNon-action yet deeds are accomplished,\nNo words yet teachings are established,\nPeople enjoy their customs,\nThings fulfill their nature.\n\nPlowing, digging, sowing—\nThese are things’ deeds,\nI do not reject them,\nNurturing and fostering their growth.\n\nThese are things’ births,\nI do not claim them,\nLetting things act naturally—\nWhat must be done cannot be avoided by me.\nWhy should I rely on my own efforts?\n\nOnly because they do not dwell in great deeds,\nThus their deeds cannot be abandoned.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"I forget the world easily,\nBut making the world forget me is difficult.\"*\nTruly so.\n\nSome may debate:\nWhy, after naming the Dao as \"non-existence,\"\nDoes this chapter suddenly turn to beauty and vice,\nAnd the six pairs of opposites?\n\nFor where the Dao exists,\nThings arise;\nWhere things arise,\nNames follow.\nWhat is called \"non-existence\" is hidden,\nBut beauty and vice are names of things,\nAnd deeds’ traces cannot escape the six pairs.\n\nThe Sage does not defy things’ nature,\nBut lets them flow, rise, and fall—\nSometimes contrary to principle,\nYet adjusts and rectifies accordingly,\nTreating ailments with medicine,\nEach restored to health.\n\nWhen the illness departs and the medicine is removed,\nThe Sage’s heart is also empty.\nHow can the six pairs of opposites be avoided?\n\nNiu Miao said:\n*\"All know the Dao’s utmost extent,\nYet fail to depart from it—\nBeauty is delight,\nVirtue is also delight.\nVice and non-virtue are both spoken of as not delightful.\"*\n\nEven as in the world a single good deed,\nOnce fixed, is sure to turn bad—\nThis is the hidden calamity in prosperity,\nThe danger in security,\nThe interplay of fortune and misfortune.\n\nNo beauty is more beautiful than serving a lord,\nYet serving too often brings disgrace.\nNo virtue is more virtuous than friendship,\nYet too many friends bring estrangement.\n\n*The Baopuzi* says:\n*\"Draped curtains gather mist,\nSilken hangings blend with clouds—\nCollecting fragrant blossoms in the grove of orchids,\nPlaying with red flowers in the pool of pearls,\nEntering the dim glow of the Eight Gates of Darkness,\nExiting with the splendor of the Vermilion Wheels.\nYet when joy reaches its peak,\nSorrow gathers in its wake;\nWhen fullness is attained,\nDeficiency follows inevitably.\"*\n\nThis is the way beauty and vice intertwine—\nAll people in the world know this principle.\n\nThus non-existence and existence mutually generate,\nFrom non-existence arises existence,\nFrom existence not ceasing arises non-existence—\nNon-existence generates existence,\nExistence returns to non-existence,\nExistence has form yet generates shadow,\nSound arises yet produces echo—\nNon-existence moves yet generates existence,\nExistence arises and returns to non-existence’s generation;\nExistence has form yet returns to non-form.\n\nNot generating is not the original non-generating,\nNot having form is not the original non-form.\n\nGenerating is the principle’s inevitable end,\nEnding cannot but end,\nJust as generating cannot but generate—\nThis is all the saying of existence and non-existence’s mutual generation.\n\nDifficulty and ease mutually fulfill one another—\nDifficulty is the gateway to ease,\nEase is the root of difficulty.\n\nIn the world, all things are difficult or easy,\nInterdependent in their use—\nEven a single difficult deed,\nIf diligently pursued, though difficult,\nWill become easy—\nIs this not ease?\n\n*(End of translation.)*\n\n「若以易心临之，则其为难矣。\nIf one approaches it with a careless heart, then it becomes difficult indeed.\n\n古语有云：世上无难事，只怕有心人。\nAs the old saying goes: There are no difficult matters in the world—only those who lack resolve.\n\n又曰：有心射山山须透，无心射纸纸难穿。\nIt is also said: With resolve, one may pierce mountains with an arrow; without it, even paper resists.\n\n洞宾曰：难难十石芝麻树上摊，易易浑似和衣一觉睡。\nZhuangzi’s disciple Dongbin remarked: Difficult tasks weigh like ten stones on a sesame tree—\nEffortless ones feel as natural as resting in one’s robes.\n\n老君曰：天下之难事必作於易，天下之大事必作於细。\nLaozi said: The world’s difficult matters arise from ease,\nAnd great undertakings begin in the minute.\n\n是以圣人犹难之，故终无难。\nThus, the Sage still regards them as difficult,\nAnd so, in the end, there is no difficulty.\n\n此难易相成之说也。\n\n长短之相形。\nThe interplay of length and brevity.\n\n夫物之不齐，物之情也。\nThings are not uniform—this is their natural state.\n\n是故无长不别短，无短不显长，\n长短之势，相形方别。\nHence, there is no length without distinction from brevity,\nNo brevity without highlighting length—\nThe very nature of length and brevity reveals their contrast.\n\n且鹤胫虽长，断之则悲，\n凫胫虽短，续之则忧。\nEven the crane’s long legs, if severed, bring sorrow,\nAnd the short legs of the teal, if lengthened, cause distress.\n\n古人有言曰：青松高百尺，绿穗低数寸。\nThe ancients said: The green pine soars a hundred feet,\nWhile the humble reed bows but a few inches.\n\n同生大块间，长短各有分。\nBoth spring from the same earth,\nYet each possesses its own measure.\n\n如人之才性，亦各有长短。\nSo too with human talent and nature—\nEach has its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\n然各长其长，各短其短，\n则鸢飞鱼跃，各得其所，\n自无长短之非也。\nYet if each fulfills its own strengths,\nAnd accepts its own weaknesses—\nThen the falcon soars and the fish leaps,\nEach finding its proper place,\nAnd there is no fault in length or brevity.\n\n若稍有片善，寸长自以为能，\n则长短必相形而随之也。\nBut if one has even a shred of virtue,\nAnd deems a single inch of length sufficient—\nThen length and brevity will inevitably contrast and follow suit.\n\n非斯之谓欤？\n\n高下之相倾。\nThe interplay of elevation and humility.\n\n夫高者尊也，下者卑也，\n虽尊卑之礼固有定在，\n然高而不谦，尊卑而不安分，\n则相倾之势由是而生也。\nElevation is nobility, humility is lowliness—\nThough the rites of rank have fixed distinctions,\nYet if one is elevated without modesty,\nOr ranked without proper humility—\nThen the very force of imbalance arises.\n\n盖贵以贱为本，高以下为基，\n若好高而不为高，则不高矣。\nFor nobility is rooted in humility,\nAnd elevation depends on a foundation of lowliness—\nIf one seeks elevation yet does not act accordingly,\nThen one cannot truly be elevated.\n\n古语有云：墙高耶，雨剥而颓之；\n渊卑耶，水就而归之。\nAs the old saying goes: A wall too high will crumble beneath the rain’s relentless assault;\nA pool too low will fill with waters that flow toward it.\n\n谚曰：岸上沙，今人担土旧人家；\n陌上路，今人来往昔人墓。\nA proverb states: Sands on the shore—\nNow men carry soil to build homes where once none stood;\nPaths through the fields—\nNow men tread where once lay ancient graves.\n\n由是观之，海水桑田之变，固有之矣。\nThus observed, the shifting of seas and fields is natural indeed.\n\n此高下相倾之势也。\nThis is the force of elevation and humility in balance.\n\n若以势而言之，则如王公之子归庶人，\n庶人之子为王公。\nIf spoken of in terms of this force,\nThen it is like the son of a noble returning to common birth,\nOr the son of a commoner ascending to noble rank.\n\n扬子云曰：朝得权为卿相，夕失势为匹夫。\nYangzi said: One may rise to minister in the morning,\nAnd fall to commoner by evening.\n\n此皆高下相倾之说也。\n\n声音之相和。\nThe interplay of sound and resonance.\n\n声者鸣也，鸣则有音，\n音必有响，响则必应，\n故云音声相和也。\nSound is utterance—when uttered, there is tone,\nAnd tone must have echo, which must respond—\nThus it is said that sound and resonance harmonize.\n\n且雷霆有声，不动不闻，\n锺鼓有音，不击不鸣。\nEven thunder’s sound, if unmovement remains, cannot be heard,\nAnd bells’ tones, if not struck, will not ring.\n\n《诗》云：嘤其鸣矣，犹求友声。\nThe *Book of Odes* says: *Ming! Ming!*—its call still seeks a harmonizing response.\n\n《易》曰：呜鹤在阴，其子和之。\nThe *Yijing* says: *The wailing crane is in the shade—its offspring responds in harmony.*\n\n此声响之相随，犹形之於影，\n自然而并生，俱出而俱没也。\nThis is how sound and echo follow one another,\nLike form and shadow—\nBoth arise naturally together,\nAnd vanish as one.\n\n夫音者，本无待於声也，\n声发而响随之耳。\nFor resonance is not dependent on sound—\nIt is only when sound is emitted that echo follows.\n\n如人言凶则气粗，声和则气悦，\n爱人者人常爱之，敬人者人常敬之，\n未尝不由己出，其犹音响之於鸣声，\n此固然之理也。\nWhen one speaks harshly, their *qi* grows coarse,\nAnd when their voice is harmonious, their *qi* is pleasing—\nThose who love others are often loved in return,\nAnd those who honor others are often honored in turn.\nThis is never otherwise—\nJust as echo follows utterance,\nSo too does this principle hold true.\n\n前后之相随。\nThe interplay of before and after.\n\n夫身行於前，影必随之后，\n阳唱於前，阴必和於后。\nFor when the body moves forward, the shadow follows behind,\nAnd when the Yang leads, the Yin must harmonize.\n\n此影形相逐，阴阳相和，\n前后相随，此则必然之理也。\nThis is how shadow chases form,\nAnd Yin harmonizes with Yang—\nBefore and after follow one another—\nThis is the inevitable principle.\n\n《孔丛子》曰：前譬之古也，后譬之今也。\nThe *Kong Congzi* says: Before is like the past,\nAnd after is like the present.\n\n古今相继，犹前后之相随，\n初无间然也。\nPast and present follow one another,\nJust as before and after—\nThere is no separation.\n\n澄明子曰：前者始条理也，后者终条理也。\nThe Sage Chengming said: Before is the beginning of order,\nAnd after is its completion.\n\n未闻有前而无后也，\n亦未见有始而无终也。\nI have never heard of a before without an after,\nNor seen a beginning without an end.\n\n前后一理也，始终一贯也。\nBefore and after are one principle,\nAnd beginning and end are a continuous thread.\n\n不由於前而至於后者，天下无之。\nThere is nothing in the world that does not arise from before and reach after.\n\n此大修行人初以无为居其前，\n无不为必继之於后，\n此自然之道也。\nThus, the great cultivator first abides in *wuwei* (non-action),\nAnd *wuwei* must inevitably follow—\nThis is the Way of Nature.\n\n是以圣人处无为之事。\nTherefore, the Sage governs through *wuwei*.\n\n圣人者，天下之至人也。\nThe Sage is the ultimate person in the world.\n\n而曰处无为之事者，何哉？\nYet why is it said that the Sage governs through *wuwei*?\n\n夫无为者，简易也。\nFor *wuwei* is simplicity.\n\n盖圣人者德并二仪，\n故参乾坤之理，而从於简易也。\nThe Sage’s virtue encompasses both Yang and Yin,\nThus they grasp the principles of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd follow simplicity.\n\n何以知之？\n《易》曰：乾以易知，坤以简能。\nHow do we know this?\nThe *Yijing* says: *Heaven is known through ease, Earth through simplicity.*\n\n易则易知，简则易从。\nEase is easy to understand,\nAnd simplicity is easy to follow.\n\n易知则有亲，易从则有功。\nEase to understand brings familiarity,\nAnd simplicity to follow yields effectiveness.\n\n有亲则可久，有功则可大。\nFamiliarity allows endurance,\nAnd effectiveness allows greatness.\n\n可久则贤人之德，可大则贤人之业。\nEndurance is the virtue of the worthy,\nAnd greatness is their accomplishment.\n\n易简而天下之理得矣。\nThrough ease and simplicity, the world’s principles are attained.\n\n此圣人之所以处无为之事也。\n\n行不言之教。\nTo practice the teaching that does not speak.\n\n夫不言者，忘言也。\nFor not speaking is forgetting speech.\n\n盖忘言之中，至理存焉。\nWithin forgetting speech, the highest principles remain.\n\n谓天下之理尽在不言之中，\n故圣人得其奥理，默而行之，\n故云行不言之教也。\nFor the world’s principles are entirely contained in not speaking—\nThus the Sage attains their profound essence,\nAnd acts in silence,\nHence it is said: *To practice the teaching that does not speak.*\n\n然夫不言之教，谓天道也，\n盖天道不言而善应也。\nYet the teaching that does not speak refers to the Dao of Heaven—\nFor Heaven’s Dao does not speak yet responds with goodness.\n\n孔子曰：天何言哉？\n四时行焉，百物生焉。\n天何言哉？\nIs this not what Confucius said?\n*Heaven speaks not—*\nYet the four seasons proceed in their order,\nAnd all things flourish in their time.\n*Heaven speaks not—*\n\n是以圣人观天之道，执天之行，\n故云行不言之教也。\nThus the Sage observes Heaven’s Dao,\nAnd follows its actions,\nHence it is said: *To practice the teaching that does not speak.*\n\n《易》曰：天生神物，圣人则之。\n天地变化，圣人效之。\n天垂象见吉凶，圣人象之。\n河出图洛出书，圣人则之。\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*Heaven births divine things—*\nThe Sage follows them.\n*Heaven and Earth transform—*\nThe Sage imitates them.\n*Heaven displays symbols to show auspiciousness and inauspiciousness—*\nThe Sage mirrors them.\n*The Yellow River reveals its map,*\n*The Luo River its script—*\nThe Sage follows them.\n\n夫神物变化，吉凶图书，\n亦未尝有言也，\n而圣人则效法象，\n斯非行不言之教之谓欤？」\nFor divine things and transformations,\nAnd symbols of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness,\nThere is no speech—\nYet the Sage responds by imitating their forms,\nIs this not the practice of the teaching that does not speak?\n\n*The myriad things act yet do not claim their deeds.*\nThe *acting* refers to the creation and flourishing of all things.\nThe *not claiming* means humility, not self-praising.\nThe *Zhongyong* says:\n*Great indeed is the Sage’s Dao,*\n*Vast and towering, reaching to Heaven.*\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*The Sage acts,*\n*And all things observe.*\n\nYet never has it been heard that the Sage boasts of his abilities.\nAs in the past, when Zongni (Confucius) traced the lineage of Yao and Shun,\nAnd established the constitutional models of Wen and Wu,\nHe aligned himself above with Heaven’s timing,\nAnd below followed Earth’s nurturing,\nLike Heaven and Earth in their boundless sustaining and covering,\nLike the four seasons in their orderly succession,\nLike the sun and moon in their alternating brilliance,\nAll things flourishing together yet not harming one another,\nThe Dao running parallel yet never conflicting.\n\nThe lesser virtue flows like a river,\nThe greater virtue deeply transforms.\nThus his disciples said:\n*\"Is our Master a Sage?*\n*How vast his abilities!\"*\n\nConfucius replied:\n*\"A Sage? That I cannot be.\"*\nThis is the humble self-effacement,\nThe *not claiming* of which we speak.\n\n*He gives birth yet does not possess.*\nThe *giving birth* is the name of *ren* (virtue).\nHow so? Does not the *Yijing* say:\n*\"Endless, ceaseless birth—*\n*This is called virtue.\"*\n\nThe *not possessing* means the Sage does not hoard his virtue for himself.\nFormer scholars said:\n*\"One may let all under Heaven benefit from the Sage’s virtue,*\n*But not let them know of the Sage’s virtue.*\n*To let them benefit and know—*\n*This is the lesser virtue.*\n*To have a method that can be debated—*\n*This is the lesser virtue.*\n*To let them benefit from the Sage’s sevenfold virtue yet remain unaware,*\n*This is the greater virtue.\"*\n\n*Without trace yet named—*\nThis is the Sage’s teaching of *giving birth yet not possessing*.\n\n*The Sage does yet does not rely.*\nThe Sage is one of many talents and arts,\nYet never does he claim them as his own,\nHence it is said: *to do yet not rely*.\n\nIn the past, Yangzi (Yang Zhu) asked the Old Master (Laozi) of the Sage’s governance.\nThe Old Master replied:\n*\"The Sage’s governance,*\n*Its power covers all under Heaven,*\n*Yet appears not to act from himself.*\n*Its transformation benefits all things,*\n*Yet the people do not rely upon it.*\n*There is no one to praise its name,*\n*Yet things rejoice in their own accord.*\n*He stands in the unfathomable,*\n*Yet wanders in the boundless.*\n*This is the teaching of doing yet not relying.\"*\n\nIs this not the same principle?\n*When deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell upon them—*\nThus it is said: *he does not depart*.\n\nThe *not dwelling* means he does not boast of his deeds.\nThe *not departing* means his name endures.\nAgain, it is said:\n*The not dwelling is self-retreat.*\nIndeed, when deeds are accomplished and the body retreats,\nThen his virtue is lasting,\nAnd his name is renowned.\nHence it is said: *his name does not depart*.\n\nThe Classics state:\n*\"Deeds accomplished, name secured,*\n*Yet the body retreats—*\n*This is Heaven’s Dao.\"*\n\nAs in the past, when Yu (the Great) tamed the waters and settled the land,\nShun (the Sage) passed the Mandate of Heaven to him,\nYet Yu declined in favor of Shun’s son, Shangjun (Kang Yu),\nAnd withdrew to Yangcheng (the City of the Sun),\nThis was *accomplishing deeds yet not dwelling*.\nAnd all under Heaven followed him—\nThis was *his name not departing*.\n\nIs this not what is meant?\n\nZhuangzi’s *Inner Chapters* says: *\"All under Heaven knows this, yet it does not depart.\"* Beauty lies within oneself, not in others. Goodness lies within oneself, not in others. Now, if one accumulates a single beauty yet desires all under Heaven to know it, then it is no longer beauty; if one performs a single good deed yet desires all under Heaven to know it, then it is no longer goodness.\n\nThe affairs of the world have opposites—what exists has its nonexistent counterpart, what is difficult has its easy counterpart, what is long has its short counterpart, what is high has its low counterpart. They generate and complete each other, contrast and incline toward each other, like echoes responding to sound, shadows following form.\n\nThe Sage encompasses all with effortless spontaneity. His actions are without contrivance, his teachings without words. Like Heaven, he nurtures all things without toil, with life’s function yet no trace of creation, with deeds yet no claim to labor. Our Master said: *\"Only Heaven is great, only Yao followed it.\"* Broad and boundless, the people cannot name it.\n\nThe Sage follows Heaven’s Way by accomplishing deeds yet not dwelling upon them. At its utmost, goodness accumulates and his name becomes renowned; virtue shines and his person is honored. He does not seek fame, yet fame follows him. Though he wished to depart from it, how could he depart?\n\nThe Master of Chu’s Retreat said: *\"Those who possess what they possess cannot truly possess it; those who lack what they possess can truly possess it.\"* This is truly speaking to the heart’s essence.\n\nThe character *去* (départ) is read as in *\"the noble departs from benevolence.\"*\n\nThe ancient scholars said: *\"If one seeks virtue yet avoids fame, then there are no deeds worth doing under Heaven. The Sage has intent in doing good yet no intent in gaining fame, yet fame cannot ultimately be made to depart—just as sound harmonizes with sound, and form follows shadow.\"*\n\nWhen read from beginning to end, the entire chapter’s meaning flows together like a pulse, its threads interconnected. It concludes by reiterating: *\"Only because he does not dwell upon it, it does not depart.\"* This is not merely a marvel of composition but a profound teaching for humanity.\n\nXu Liu said: *\"All under Heaven knows this, yet it does not depart\"*—the meaning echoes throughout.\n\nWealth is the root of misfortune, and joy the source of sorrow; this is the natural order. None can perceive it, so the Sage, moved by pity for the world’s ignorance, declares: *\"All under Heaven knows beauty and goodness, rushing toward and delighting in them, yet does not know that evil and harm arise from them.\"*\n\nThis principle is like the generation of having and lacking, the completion of difficulty and ease, the contrast of length and shortness, the inclination of high and low, the harmony of sound and echo, the succession of before and after. From ancient times to now, all things and affairs have their opposites, like an endless ring.\n\nOnly the Sage stands alone, without counterpart. Thus the Sage dwells in non-action, yet it does not depart.\n\nOnly the Sage stands independent, with no opposing counterpart. For he dwells in non-action, practices teaching without words.\n\nNon-action is not inaction—it means following nature’s spontaneity, responding without contrivance, and thus achieving harmony.\n\nTeaching without words is not mere silence—it means sincere inner cultivation and loyal, trustworthy outward conduct. The world follows him without effort or expenditure. Though he daily responds to myriad affairs, he leads yet does not initiate, so he does not weary of labor—hence it is said: *\"He acts yet does not claim the deed.\"* The people are nourished by his care alone, with no personal gain—hence it is said: *\"He gives life yet does not possess.\"* He establishes deeds and fulfills his role, acting only as duty demands, without boasting of his own ability—hence it is said: *\"He acts yet does not rely upon it.\"* When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled, he retreats and yields his position—hence it is said: *\"He accomplishes deeds yet does not dwell upon them.\"*\n\nOnly thus, by following Heaven’s Dao, is his person preserved and his deeds enduring. Therefore, his fame is praised across ten thousand generations without ceasing. Hence it is said: *\"It does not depart.\"*\n\n*Zhiyi’s* *Collected Remnants* says: *\"Having and lacking generate each other, just as there must be low if there is high. Thus, though having and lacking differ, both ultimately escape the realm of mere possession.\"* This speaks to the forms of things, borrowing the contrast of having and lacking to illustrate it.\n\nGuang [commentary] says: *\"These six pairs are why things are unequal; only those who lose their counterparts can achieve harmony.\"*\n\nFrom *Cross-Referencing the Masters*:\n*The Master Zhuang* says: *\"The Dao can be weak yet strong, soft yet hard, yin yet yang, hidden yet manifest, encompassing Heaven and Earth, responding without measure. To know shallowly is to not know deeply; to know externally is to not know internally; to know coarsely is to not know finely. To know is to not know; to not know is to know. Who knows that knowing is not knowing, and not knowing is knowing? The Dao cannot be heard—hearing it is false. The Dao cannot be seen—seeing it is false. The Dao cannot be spoken—speaking it is false. Who knows the formless form?*\n\n*\"Therefore, all under Heaven knows goodness as goodness, yet it is no longer goodness. The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\"*\n\nShi Tan said: *\"All under Heaven knows beauty as beauty, yet it is already evil. All know goodness as goodness, yet it is no longer goodness.\"*\n\nThus, having and lacking generate each other, difficulty and ease complete each other, length and shortness contrast each other, high and low incline toward each other, sound harmonizes with sound, before follows after. Beauty and evil, goodness and harm, having and lacking, difficulty and ease, length and shortness, high and low—all are relative terms without fixed names.\n\nWhen there is beauty, there is evil in opposition; when there is goodness, there is harm in opposition. Hence it is said: *\"All under Heaven knows beauty as beauty, yet it is already evil; all know goodness as goodness, yet it is no longer goodness.\"*\n\nWhen it comes to having, there is lacking in opposition; having difficulty, there is ease in opposition; having length, there is shortness in opposition; having height, there is lowliness in opposition. Thus, they generate and complete each other, contrast and incline toward each other.\n\nYet these are all opposites, but as for sound and sequence, they are not starkly opposed, yet why are they included as well? Truly, the Way in which they generate and complete each other, contrast and incline toward each other, is also like the harmonization of sound and the following of sequence—this is the natural principle.\n\nThis further illustrates that even what does not seem opposite is used to describe what must be opposite. Therefore, the Sage handles the affairs of *wuwei* (無為, non-action), and practices the teaching of *busheng* (不言, non-speech).\n\n*Wuwei* and *busheng* are both means to embody the Dao’s *wu ming* (無名, namelessness). With names come action and speech. Since the Dao has no name, what need is there for speech and action?\n\nThus, it transcends the realm of beauty and evil, goodness and harm. Only in *wuwei* and *busheng* can beauty even be named—what of evil? Only in *wuwei* and *busheng* can goodness be named—what of harm?\n\nAll things arise, yet the Sage does not claim them; they are born, yet the Sage does not possess them. Act without relying upon it; when the work is done, do not dwell upon it.\n\nAll things arise, yet I do not claim them—let them arise. They are born, yet I do not possess them—I though give birth to them, yet never claim that they are mine to give birth to.\n\nAct without relying upon it—I act through *wuwei* (non-action), yet never rely upon what I have done. When the work is done, I do not dwell upon it—though I give birth to them, it cannot be said that I have no merit, yet I do not dwell upon that merit.\n\nThus, though I am beautiful, others do not know me as such; though I am good, others do not know me as such.\n\nOnly by not dwelling upon it does its essence remain. If one dwells upon it, it departs. If I dwell upon my beauty, when beauty’s name departs, it becomes evil. If I dwell upon my goodness, when goodness’s name departs, it becomes harm.\n\nOnly by handling the affairs of *wuwei* (non-action), practicing the teaching of *busheng* (non-speech), acting without claiming, giving birth without possessing, acting without relying upon it, and completing the work without dwelling upon it—thus, its name does not depart.\n\nIts name does not depart, then it is my name. This passage elaborates upon the previous meaning of *wu ming* (namelessness).\n\n*Dao De Jing Ji Yi* (道德真经集义, *The Collected Meanings of the Dao De Jing*) Volume Six concludes. Volume Seven begins.\n\n「Master Yinyuan of the Concentrated Dao/Way’s profound and mysterious *De* (virtue/power) is always present.\n\n*Liu Weiyong*, who oversees the affairs of the *Xuanmiao Guan* (Mysterious Marvels Hall), has compiled this text.\n\n*Ding Yidong*, in his capacity as a *delong* (editor) of the *Jushimi Yuan* (Office of the Imperial Secretariat) and a *taifu shi bu* (official of the Bureau of Finance) in the previous dynasty, has verified it.\n\n**Chapter on Not Esteeming the Virtuous (不尚贤章):**\n*Considerations of Differences (考异):* The *Master of the Yellow River* (河上公) composed *The Chapter on the Mysterious Transformation of the Alone-Evolved* (至神独化义章), while *Zhao Shizhu* (赵实庵) authored *The Chapter on the Mysterious Transformation of the Alone-Evolved* (至神独化义章) and *The Chapter on Pacifying the People* (安民章).\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang* (唐明皇) expounded: In the previous chapter, it was made clear that the myriad transformations return to the root, and the Dao/Way’s virtuous transformation is illuminated. In this chapter, it is made clear that the noble and esteemed are not to be relied upon, and *wuwei* (non-action) leads to the ultimate principle.\n\nFirst, it is stated that one should not esteem the virtuous, thereby severing the traces of arrogance and partiality. Next, the *saintly principle* (圣理) is mentioned, demonstrating the method of establishing the teaching, concluding with *wuwei* (non-action) to show that transformation is complete yet returns to simplicity.\n\n*Du Guangting* (杜光庭) said: The great sage establishes the principle, while the virtuous assist it. How can they be like fish and water without relying upon each other? From the sovereign of the Five Phases (二五之主) down to the tyrant-king (霸王之君), those who open states and establish their foundations depend upon the virtuous as their basis.\n\nThe phrase \"not esteeming\" (不尚) refers to the conduct of arrogance and boasting. If the virtuous are employed, the people will naturally govern themselves; if boasting is employed, grievances and conflicts will arise. Not esteeming boasting will naturally eliminate grievances and conflicts, and not valuing rare and precious goods will make the people without covetousness or theft—thus aligning with the saintly, and with the Dao/Way’s *xuzi* (emptiness), *wuzhi* (non-knowing), and *wuyu* (non-desire), fulfilling the principle of not esteeming.\n\n*Zhang Chongying* (张冲应) replied: \"Pacifying\" (安) means \"governing\" (治), and \"people\" (民) refers to \"humanity\" (人). This chapter speaks of how rulers and great officials reflect upon the Dao/Way, nurturing their own selves, and thus their upright actions and virtuous influence will follow. If the people take *wuwei* (non-action) as their foundation, there will be none who are not governed and pacified.\n\nNot esteeming the virtuous prevents the people from striving in conflict. Not valuing rare and difficult-to-obtain goods prevents the people from becoming thieves.»\n\nIf desirable things are unseen, the heart will not be disturbed.\nThus, the saintly governance\nempties the heart,\nfills the belly,\nweakens the will,\nstrengthens the bones,\never keeping the people in *wuzhi* (non-knowing) and *wuyu* (non-desire),\nso that even the wise dare not act.\n\nTo act with *wuwei* (non-action)\nis to ensure nothing remains ungoverned.\n\n**Variants:**\n*\"Heart\"* (心) in *\"heart will not be disturbed\"* (使心不乱) was originally *\"people’s heart\"* (民心) in ancient texts.\n*\"Nothing remains ungoverned\"* (无不治) was rendered as *\"nothing remains undone\"* (无不为) by Fu Yue (傅奕) and Sun Deng (孙登), matching the ancient version.\n\n**He Shang Gong (河上公) said:**\n*\"Not esteeming the virtuous\"* (不尚贤) refers to those virtuous in the eyes of the world—\neloquent in speech, skilled in rhetoric, yet detached from the Dao/Way, prioritizing artifice over substance.\n*\"Not esteeming\"* means neither rewarding them with office nor wealth.\nThus, the people will not strive in contention.\n*\"Not contending\"* clarifies the return to natural simplicity.\n*\"Not valuing rare goods\"* means the ruler does not hoard precious treasures—\ngold abandoned in mountains, pearls cast into depths.\nThus, the people will not steal.\nWith the ruler’s purity above, none below will be greedy.\n\n*\"Desirable things unseen\"* means abandoning licentious music and distant beauties,\nso the heart remains undisturbed.\nNo licentiousness, no confusion.\n\nThus, the saintly governance—\ngoverning the nation and nurturing the self are one.\n\n*\"Empty the heart\"* means eliminating cravings, dispelling chaos.\n*\"Fill the belly\"* means embracing the Dao/Way, holding to unity, guarding the Five Spirits.\n*\"Weaken the will\"* means gentle, yielding, and humble—never seizing power.\n*\"Strengthen the bones\"* means cherishing essence, moderating exertion, ensuring marrow fills and bones harden.\nEver keeping the people in *wuzhi* (non-knowing) and *wuyu* (non-desire),\nreturning to simplicity, guarding purity.\n\nThus, even the wise dare not act—\nfor deep thought prevents reckless speech.\nTo act with *wuwei* (non-action)\nis to move without contrivance, following natural course,\nand thus nothing remains ungoverned.\nWith virtue’s influence profound, the people dwell in peace.\n\n**Wang Fu Si (王辅嗣) said:**\nFrom *\"not esteeming the virtuous\"* to *\"the heart will not be disturbed\"*—\n*\"Virtuous\"* means capable, *\"esteeming\"* is praise by name, *\"valuing\"* is exaltation by title.\nIf only capability is rewarded, why bestow praise and honor?\nExalting the virtuous for fame alone, their glory exceeding their worth,\nthe people will rush to compete, their abilities vying in rivalry.\nWealth beyond use will tempt the greedy to steal, risking life for plunder.\nThus, if desirable things are unseen, the heart will not be disturbed.\n\nTherefore, the saintly governance truly *\"fills the belly\"*—\nthe heart holds wisdom, the belly sustains life;\nempty of wisdom, yet full of nourishment.\n\n*\"Weaken the will, strengthen the bones\"*—\nbones without knowledge remain sturdy,\nwhile the will, when unrestrained, breeds chaos.\nEver keeping the people in *wuzhi* (non-knowing) and *wuyu* (non-desire),\nthey guard their true nature.\n\nThus, even the wise dare not act—\n*\"the wise\"* refers to those who act.\nAnd so nothing remains ungoverned.\n\n**Tang Ming Huang (唐明皇) said:**\n*\"Not esteeming the virtuous\"* prevents contention.\nExalting the virtuous leaves traces—\nthose who follow them will contend.\nIf the virtuous and unvirtuous each fulfill their roles,\nthere will be no contention.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\n*\"Esteeming\"* means elevating in status.\n*\"Virtuous\"* means talent and ability.\nThe ruler’s exaltation of ability leaves traces;\nfollowing these traces loses authenticity,\nand losing authenticity is the root of esteeming the virtuous.\nContention arises from clinging to these traces—\nbetter than the Dao’s mysterious transformation,\nassigning *wuwei* (non-action),\nletting the people follow naturally—\nclouds obey the dragon, winds follow the tiger.\nThen, even in the reign of Tang Yao (唐尧),\nthere will be no shortage of worthy ministers like Yuan Kai (元凯);\nI Lu (伊吕) ascending to office,\nfulfilling the hopes of the people.\nEach in their proper place, none coveting more,\nand thus there is no contention.\n\n**Original Text Translation:**\n\nDo not esteem rare and difficult-to-obtain goods,\nso the people will not become thieves.\n\nRare and difficult-to-obtain goods refer to what lies beyond one’s natural endowment.\nTo seek what cannot be had is futile—thus they are called difficult to obtain.\nHe who does not rest in his natural allotment,\nbut covets what he lacks,\nhas already strayed from his nature—\nhow can this not be theft?\n\nLet things be used according to their nature,\nand let actions accord with one’s abilities,\nthen rare and difficult-to-obtain goods will lose their allure,\nand the essence of life will not be stolen.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nHumans, upon receiving life, are endowed with a natural portion.\nThe materials and faculties they inherit are their own body and treasure.\nTo seek beyond one’s allotment is futile—\nthus they are called difficult to obtain.\n\nIf one does not abide by his nature,\nbut aspires to brilliance beyond his endowment,\nhe loses his true essence\nand becomes a thief by private inclination.\n\nNow, if the wise and foolish follow their natural inclinations,\nand abilities align with their capacities,\nwith no desire to exceed their portion,\nthey will naturally disregard rare and difficult-to-obtain goods,\nfor they are already content with what they possess—\nwho would then be a thief?\n\nThus, Zhuangzi said:\n*\"The unvirtuous steal the essence of life and glut themselves on wealth and honor.\"*\n\nIt is also explained:\nIf the ruler does not esteem pearls, rhinoceros horn, or precious gems,\nhis governance will be pure and tranquil,\nand the people, transformed by this, will naturally abandon greed.\nEach knowing their sufficiency,\nthey will not become thieves.\n\nDo not present what is desirable,\nso the heart remains undisturbed.\n\nSince there is no pursuit of the virtuous nor coveting of rare goods,\nthere is nothing visibly desirable to incite confusion in the heart.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nTo aspire to brilliance is to see what is desirable—\nwhen desire stirs, how can the heart not be disturbed?\nNow, if one neither elevates ability nor seeks beyond his portion,\nthere will be nothing desirable to provoke confusion in the heart.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThis speaks of the Sage’s governance over the realm and self,\nestablishing it as the foundation of teaching.\nWhat more is there to governance of the realm?\nOnly governance of the self.\n\nThus, empty the heart and fill the belly,\ncut off desire and forget knowledge in *wuwei*,\nand nothing will remain ungoverned.\n\nEmpty the heart.\nWhen the heart is not disturbed by what is desirable, it is empty.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nTo labor the mind after external things is to be obscured by worldly affairs,\nbut to cultivate stillness and preserve purity is to let desires not arise—\nwhen desires do not arise, the heart is empty.\nZhuangzi said: *\"An empty room gives birth to white.\"*—\nmeaning that when the heart is empty, pure clarity arises naturally.\n\nThus it is said:\nEmpty the heart, fill the belly,\nlet virtue and power internally suffuse—\nthen there will be no arrogance or contrivance,\njust as one who eats until satisfied will stop,\ngenerating no further greed.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThe belly, when full, does not crave more;\nwhen virtue and power internally suffuse,\nno greed arises—\nthus it is said, *fill the belly*.\n*\"Eating until satisfied and stopping\"* comes from the *Spring and Autumn Annals*,\nwhere Yan Mo and Ru Kuang advised Duke Wuzi of Wei:\n*\"Use the belly of a commoner to govern the heart of a noble—\nwhen satisfied, there will be no further greed.\"*\n\nWeaken the will.\nWhen the heart is empty, the will grows weak.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThe will is the mind’s affair—\nwhen the mind has something to act upon, it is called will.\nTo let the mind adhere to gentleness and weakness is to know\nthat when the heart is empty, the will weakens.\n\nStrengthen the bones.\nWhen the belly is full, the bones grow strong.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThe bones are the body’s framework.\nSince virtue and power internally suffuse,\nand there is no greed,\nthe belly remains full—\nwhen the belly is full, the bones grow strong.\n\nAlways let the people be without knowledge and without desire.\nAlways let them lack the knowledge of contention and esteem,\nand the desire for acquisition.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThe Sage’s teaching of emptying the heart and filling the belly\nseeks to make the people naturally free from the knowledge of contention\nand the desire for acquisition,\nso they may transform on their own.\n\nLet those who know dare not act.\nThrough tranquil transformation, when knowledge and desire are exhausted,\neven those who possess knowledge will not dare to act.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThose without knowledge and desire are already tranquil—\nthus, those who possess knowledge will gradually be refined by pure transformation,\ndaring not to act in pursuit of traces or greed,\nbut instead practicing *wuwei*.\n\nTo act in *wuwei* is to govern perfectly.\n\nTo act in *wuwei* while letting people return to their nature,\npure transformation will naturally ensue.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nTo act while abiding in *wuwei*—\neven if acting, it is still *wuwei*.\nSince the pursuit of the virtuous is abandoned,\nand rare goods are not sought,\npeople follow their natural portions,\nand things retain their authenticity—\nin *wuwei*, what is there to arrogate or contrive?\nThough without fame or repute,\npeople do not recognize it,\nyet who can say the pure wind does not prevail?\n\nDu Guangting said:\n*\"Not esteeming the virtuous prevents contention.*\n*Pursuing traces*—this means artificiality.\nOnce the principle of esteeming the virtuous arises,\nartificial men will inevitably appear.\nWhy? Because the virtuous are difficult to discern.\nThe cunning feign trustworthiness,\nthe flatterers feign loyalty—\nhow easy is it to distinguish them?\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*'Wisdom produces great deceit.'*\nThus, when the ruler values wisdom,\nthe people respond with deceit;\nwhen the ruler values the virtuous,\nthe people respond with artificiality.\nIt is better to rectify oneself and lead by example,\ngoverning through *wuwei*,\nnurturing with the Great Harmony,\ntransforming through tranquility—\nthen worthy ministers will naturally serve their roles.\n\nThis is what is meant by *clouds following the dragon, winds following the tiger*.\nClouds follow the dragon and winds follow the tiger—\nthis is Confucius’ interpretation of the *Book of Changes*’ *Qian* hexagram,\nwhere the fifth line says: *The flying dragon in the sky.*\nSince it can broadly influence all things,\nwater flows to dampness,\nfire turns to dryness,\nclouds follow the dragon,\nwinds follow the tiger.\nEach follows its kind, responding naturally—\nthis illustrates the Son of Heaven ascending to the fifth position,\nand all under heaven coming to his court.\n\nThe Sage acts, and all things behold him—\nthose rooted in Heaven turn upward,\nthose rooted in Earth turn downward.\nThis speaks of water, which is yin—\nwhen flowing on Earth, it seeks dampness.\nFire, which is yang—\nwhen burning wood, it seeks dryness.\nThough these two things lack awareness or sentiment,\nthey are moved by *qi* and respond thus.\nAgain, the dragon is a water creature,\nand clouds are water *qi*—\nwhen the dragon roars, mist rises.\nThe tiger is a fierce beast,\nand wind is a moving force—\nwhen the tiger howls, valley winds arise.\nThese two things, though possessing awareness and sentiment,\nshare the same *qi* and kind as those without—\nthus they respond in the same way.\n\n「When the Sage descends into the world, the flying dragon soars through Heaven,\nand the worthy and virtuous support one another—\nall things respond in harmony, thus expanding their influence.\n\nEmperor Yao of the Tang dynasty, surnamed Yiqi and named Fangxun,\nwas known as Emperor Tao of the Tang clan.\n\nEmperor Shun of the Yu clan,\na descendant of Zhuanyu, grandson of Qiaoniu,\nson of Guying, born to Mother Yuleng at Yaochu,\nwas thus surnamed Yao and named Zhonghua.\n\nThe eight **Yuan** and eight **Kai** were his ministers.\nIn ancient times, the High Xin (尧) clan had eight talented sons:\nBo Feng, Zhong Kan, Shu Xian, Ji Zhong,\nBo Hu, Zhong Xiong, Shu Bao, Ji Li—\nloyal, solemn, reverent, and harmonious,\nspreading benevolence and grace—\nthe people of all under Heaven called them the eight **Yuan**.\n\nThe High Yang (舜) clan had eight talented sons:\nCang Shu, Tui Gu, Dao Jie, Dai Lin,\nLong Jiang, Ting Jian, Zhong Rong, Shu Da—\nvirtuous and broad-minded, wise and sincere—\nthe people of all under Heaven called them the eight **Kai**.\n\nThese sixteen clans united in their excellence,\nand their renown did not fade.\nYet Yao did not trust them,\nand instead raised Shun as his minister,\nappointed the eight **Yuan** to propagate the Five Teachings to the four quarters,\nand assigned the eight **Kai** to govern the **Hou Tu** (后土, the Earthly Realm).\n\nThe **Tai** and **Heng** (台衡) were the expectations of the Son of Heaven—\nhe established the Three Ministers (三公) to symbolize the Three **Tai** (台, celestial palaces).\nHe did not value rare and difficult treasures,\nso the people did not become thieves.\n\nHuman life originates from the vital essence of Heaven and Earth,\nand those who receive the clear, bright, and pure *qi* become Sages and worthy ones,\nwhile those who receive the turbid, stagnant, and confused *qi* become foolish and lowly.\nThe Sages and worthy ones possess vast divine intelligence,\nwhile the foolish and dim-witted are clouded in ignorance.\nThus, there are inherent differences in human nature.\n\nLaozi said to Confucius:\n*\"The Way generates people and all things,\nand birds, beasts, insects, and all creatures have their odd and even—\nthis refers to differing *qi*.\nBut common people do not know its nature,\nonly those who grasp Dao and virtue can trace its origin.\"*\n\nThe *Wenzi* (文子) says:\n*\"Clear *qi* is Heaven, turbid *qi* is Earth,\nharmonious *qi* is humanity.\nWithin harmonious *qi*, there is brightness and darkness—\nthus, there are the worthy and the foolish.\nIf the foolish seek to emulate the worthy, they exceed their nature—\nthis is called *yue fen* (越分, transgressing one’s limits).\nIf the dark seek to replace the bright, they make false demands—\nthis is called *mang qiu* (妄求, presumptuous desire).\nThis is the act of stealing the essence of life\nand greedily coveting wealth and honor—\nwords from the *Zhuangzi*’s *‘Pianmu’* (骈拇, ‘Extra Thumbs’) chapter.\"*\n\nWealth and honor are coveted because they can be seized,\nbut when there is no higher path to aspire to,\npeople accept their lot,\nacting according to their ability and receiving tasks accordingly—\nhow much less would they transgress their limits\nto greedily steal what is not their due!\n\nA ruler does not value pearls, rhinoceros horns, or rare treasures—\nthis prevents the people from becoming thieves.\nHe does not display what is desirable,\nso his heart remains undisturbed.\nTo covet and admire is to envy brilliance.\n\nHuman nature is limited,\nyet to envy wisdom is to transgress one’s nature—\nthis is called *desire* (欲).\n\nAgain, those who cultivate the Dao,\nin their early stages,\nthough their practice is incomplete,\ntheir refinement not yet mature,\nfear what is desirable,\nbeing drawn by the realm of phenomena—\nthus, they retreat into mountains and forests,\navoiding the clamor of the world.\nBut when their hearts are tranquil and their wills steadfast,\nthe realm cannot entice them—\nthey move through the day with ease,\nnever wearying.\nThis is the saying:\n*\"Small retreat in the mountains, great retreat in the marketplace.\"*\n\nUnable to sever desire,\nfearing the pull of phenomena,\nthey hide in mountains and forests to avoid what they see—\nuntil their hearts are purified and their thoughts still,\ntheir minds dwell on the true and genuine,\nfree from external disturbances,\npreserving inner serenity—\neven amidst the bustling markets,\nname and gain do not touch their hearts;\neven amidst the worldly paths,\ncontroversies do not disrupt their intentions.\nMingling with the city,\nhow does this harm the cultivation of the genuine?\n\nThus, the Sage’s principle:\n*\"The True and Perfect Man said to the Yellow Emperor:\n‘I have never heard of a man who cultivates his body\nyet fails to bring order to his state.’\nThe body of one man is a microcosm of his state—\nthe chest and abdomen are like palaces and halls,\nthe four limbs like boundaries and territories,\nthe bones and joints like officials.\nThe spirit is like the ruler,\nthe blood like the ministers,\nand the *qi* like the people.\nTo govern the body is to govern the state—\nloving the people secures the state,\ncherishing the *qi* preserves the body.\nIf the people scatter, the state falls;\nif the *qi* is exhausted, life dies.\nWhat has fallen cannot be restored,\nwhat is dead cannot be revived—\nthus, the Perfect Man extinguishes breath before it arises,\nand treats ailments before they manifest.\n*Qi* is difficult to nurture yet easily corrupted,\nthe people are hard to gather yet easily dispersed—\ngovernance must begin before chaos arises,\nnot after it has already passed.\"*\n\n**Reflect upon this!**\n\n**Empty your heart.**\nOnly when the Dao gathers in emptiness does emptiness embrace the Dao.\nWhen the Dao gathers in the heart,\nthe spirit plays with transformation,\nthe heart communicates with Heaven,\nand all things spontaneously transform below—\nthe Sage rests in harmony above.\nThis is the ultimate principle of governance.\n\n*\"The empty room produces whiteness\"*—\nwords from the *Zhuangzi*’s *‘Renjian Shijie’* (人间世, ‘The World of Man’) chapter.\nThe room is the heart—\nto see what is present as if it were absent is to empty the heart.\nWhen the heart is emptied,\npure whiteness naturally arises.\nPure whiteness is the appearance of great clarity and openness.\n\nThe *Inner Observation Scripture* (内观经) says:\n*\"The heart is neither green nor red,\nneither white nor yellow,\nneither long nor short,\nneither round nor square—\nit encompasses Heaven and Earth,\nyet enters the finest hairs.\nRestrain it, and it ceases;\nrelease it, and it runs wild.\nCalmness and stillness bring life,\nturbulence and agitation bring death.\nIt illuminates the eight directions,\nor it confuses even one corner.\nHumanity’s greatest difficulty lies in the heart—\nthus, teaching people to cultivate the Dao is to teach them to cultivate the heart.\nTeaching people to cultivate the heart is to teach them the Dao.\nThe heart cannot be stilled,\nbut through the Dao it is stilled;\nthe heart cannot be seen,\nbut through the Dao it is illuminated.\nThe dual paths of good and evil,\nall worldly laws arise from the heart and perish in the heart—\nthose who practice the Dao still the heart and attain the Dao,\nwhile the common folk indulge the heart and endanger themselves.\"*\n\nThe heart gives rise to chaos, its extinction brings order—\nthus the Son of Heaven establishes officials,\nclarifies laws and punishments,\nsets rewards and calamities,\nand hangs omens of fortune and misfortune,\nall to guide humanity—\nfor these are measures against the heart’s unruliness.\n\nThe heartless are without commandments,\nthe steadfast-hearted are without doubt,\nthe still-hearted act not at all,\nthe restrained-hearted are not disordered,\nthe rectified-hearted are not perverse,\nthe purified-hearted are not defiled,\nthe empty-hearted are not attached.\n\nTo grasp these seven principles,\none may speak of the Dao,\none may speak of cultivating the heart.\n\nFill the belly.\n\nThe heart’s desires are boundless,\nthe belly’s capacity is sufficient.\nThe heart is boundless, so empty it.\nThe belly is sufficient, so fill it.\nAn empty heart gives rise to no cravings,\na full belly halts greed of its own accord.\n\nCherish loyalty and sincerity,\nembrace simplicity and purity—\nthus virtue is complete within.\n\n*The *Chūnqiū* is the name of the annals of Lǔ.\nWhen Yán Mò and Rǔ Kuān remonstrated,\nit was in the twenty-eighth year of Duke Zāo of *Chūnqiū*,\nwhen Wèi Xiànzǐ of Jìn, Shū by name,\nheld office and appointed his son Wù as Great Officer of Gěngyáng—\nnow Jìnyáng.\nIn winter, there was a case in Gěngyáng,\nand Wù could not decide it,\nso he brought the matter before Xiànzǐ.\n\nThe plaintiff’s elder, with female musicians as tribute,\nintended to give them to Wèi Zǐ.\nWù said to the two ministers Yán Mò and Rǔ Kuān:\n*\"Our lord is renowned among the thousand lords for his refusal of bribes—\nyet to accept tribute from Gěngyáng would be the height of greed.\nMy lords must remonstrate!\"*\nBoth agreed.\n\nAfter the court audience, he awaited them in the hall. The tribute was presented, and Wèi Xiànzǐ summoned the two ministers to dine. When the food was served, he sighed three times. After eating, he had them sit.\n\nWèi Xiànzǐ said, *\"I have heard from my elder kinsmen that there is a saying: 'Only when eating does one forget worries.' When my lords placed the food before me, they sighed three times. Why is this?\"*\n\nThey answered with identical words: *\"When others gave the two lesser men wine, they did not eat at night, and when the wine arrived, they feared it might not be enough—thus the first sigh. In the middle of the meal, they reproached themselves, saying, 'Should the General’s food be deemed insufficient?'—thus the second sigh. When the tribute was fully presented, they wished that their own bellies might serve as the virtuous mind of a noble one, and they prayed earnestly for it to cease—thus the third sigh.\"*\n\nWèi Xiànzǐ declined the tribute from Gěngyáng.\n\n*Sprinkled* is the word for posthumous title. The *Chūnqiū* records: *\"Wù Zǐ, whose given name was Wèi, was posthumously titled Wù.\"* The two ministers, Yán Mò and Rǔ Kuān, remonstrated with Wù Zǐ, wishing that their own bellies might serve as the virtuous mind of a noble one. The belly is easily filled, yet the mind is hard to satisfy—this was their desire to curb his greed and not accept the tribute from Gěngyáng. Even when lesser men’s bellies are full, they still know to stop; how much more should a noble one’s mind be content!\n\nThe *Chūnqiū* praised this act.\n\nThe Wèi clan’s rise was due to their accepting remonstrance. Their resolve was weakened.\n\nThe *Shī Xù* states: *\"What arises in the heart is called resolve.\"* What the heart gives rise to is resolve; what it acts upon is deed. If the heart is soft and yielding, then there will be no reckless, hasty, or contentious affairs—all will be in harmony.\n\nHarmony in affairs is the foundation of governance. Strengthen their bones.\n\nIf their resolve is weakened, then their virtue and gentleness will not be sullied by external temptations. If their bones are strengthened, then their firmness and preparedness will be rooted within. Those who follow the Dao will have sinews and bones that are strong and resilient—no hundred maladies can invade them.\n\nA full belly strengthens the bones; the harmonious *qi* is abundant. In governing the realm, clear administration brings peace to the people, and frugal expenditures ensure their strength is plentiful.\n\nPeaceful people are those whose resolve is weakened. Abundant strength is those whose bones are strengthened. Always let the people be without knowledge or desire.\n\nGreed and avarice give rise to strife; knowledge sparks action.\n\nThe strife and desires being absent, clarity and tranquility will naturally manifest. Let those who possess knowledge dare not act.\n\nWhen the lower follows the upper, it is like the wind bending the grass—pure and harmonious, universally permeating, all returning to the state of *non-action*. To act in *non-action* is to have nothing left ungoverned.\n\nThe principle of *non-action* is vast indeed! *Non-action* does not mean withdrawing so that nothing comes, or pushing so that nothing stays, or forcing so that there is no response, or moving so that nothing shifts, or being rigid and stagnant so that nothing flows, or being coiled and damp so that nothing scatters.\n\nIt means that private desires do not intrude upon the public Dao, that appetites do not pervert proper methods. To act in accordance with principle, to establish merit through resources, to complete deeds without self-praise, to achieve feats without claiming renown—this is *non-action*.\n\nIf water is used with a boat, sand with a cart, mud with a sled, and mountains with a wheelbarrow, if one cultivates summer fields and winter ponds, follows elevation for tillage and depression for reservoirs, then this is not what I call *action*—it is *non-action*.\n\nThe *non-action* of the Sage follows naturally, relies upon the people, demands without toil, plans without error, acts without omission. Their words are refined as writings, their deeds as models, their advancement and retreat suit the times, their movement and stillness follow principle. They neither favor beauty nor detest ugliness, nor do their rewards and punishments stem from personal likes or dislikes. Each has their own appointed name, each fulfills their own proper function. Matters arise from nature itself, without deviation from the self. They conform to Heaven’s timing, adapt to Earth’s traits, and follow humanity’s inclinations.\n\nThus, ministers gather like spokes to a wheel, the worthy and unworthy each employing their talents. The ruler gains means to govern his ministers, the ministers gain means to serve their ruler—this is the Dao of *non-action* in governing the realm.\n\nThe unheard and unscented is the *Shijing* [Book of Songs]—[大雅] [Great Odes]—[文王篇] [Wenwang’s Chapter]. It speaks of Heaven’s Dao being difficult to know: the ears do not hear its sounds, the nose does not perceive its fragrances. If one follows the rituals of Wenwang, then the world will naturally trust and comply.\n\nThe unrecognized and unknown is the *Shijing*—[大雅] [Great Odes]—[皇矣篇] [Huangyi’s Chapter]. It speaks of those who do not acknowledge the past nor comprehend the present, yet act in accordance with Heaven’s laws.\n\nThis says that Heaven’s Dao values sincerity, esteems nature’s essence, and does not exalt the worthy nor hold wealth in high regard—this aligns with it.\n\nThe Song emperor Daozong said: *\"Not exalting the worthy leads to the people not becoming thieves.\"* Exalting the worthy brings many who know, to the point where the world is greatly alarmed, and Confucianists and Mohists all rise up. Valuing wealth brings many desires, to the point where daylight thefts occur, and robbers lurk even at midday.\n\nNot exalting the worthy means the people each settle into their own appointed nature and fate, without striving to surpass others, hence they do not contend.\n\nNot valuing wealth means the people each find contentment in their own natural inclinations and fates, without coveting what they do not possess, hence they do not become thieves.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Trim the deeds of the Ru historians, and muzzle the mouths of Yang and Mo.\"*\n\nThe virtue/power of the world thus begins to return to its original unity.\n\n*The Traveling Wolf* says: *\"Do not exalt the strange and devalue the useful; only then will the people be content. Do not show them what is desirable, lest their hearts be disordered.\"*\n\nWhen people have desires, they will even contest their very nature and fate—plundering, deceiving, and committing every outrage. Boyi, seeing the allure of fame, starved to death beneath Chief Yang’s hill; Zhi, seeing the lure of profit, met his end on Dongling’s heights. Their passions burned like wildfire, their coldness froze like ice, and so their hearts were shattered, reckless, and uncontrollable.\n\nYet the Sage does not pursue profit, does not shun harm, does not rejoice in longevity, nor lament early death. He does not prize advancement nor despise obscurity. Then what is there to desire? When desires do not arise, my heart is serene. When stirred, it responds; when still, it is unobstructed. In motion, it does not chase; at rest, it does not resist. What can disturb it?\n\nConfucius was forty and free from doubt; Mencius, forty and no longer troubled in heart—both had attained this.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance aims to keep the people in a state of *wu zhi* (無知) and *wu yu* (無欲). The valley is empty and thus responsive; the mirror is empty and thus reflective. The gourd is empty and thus can receive; the ear is empty and thus can hear; the eye is empty and thus can see; the nose is empty and thus can smell. If filled, they become obstructed.\n\nThe Sage, when compelled to govern the world, treats all with equal benevolence, strengthens the near while uplifting the distant, follows what is natural, and lets things unfold of their own accord—what need for scheming? Yao’s elevation of Shun and execution of Gun nearly achieved this.\n\nWhen the heart is empty, it listens impartially and observes without bias, free from likes and dislikes. When the belly is full, the mind is content and at ease, free from greed. Why exalt the worthy or blame the unworthy?\n\nThe Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes. The belly, unselective, can contain all. The will is the mind’s knowledge; the bones are the body’s foundation. A strong will may lead one to relentlessly pursue fame or wealth, to boast of one’s abilities or flaunt one’s achievements—ever farther from the Mysterious Dao. Weak bones cause erratic movement, clashing with others until one is exhausted and cannot return.\n\nThe Sage’s will is ever humble, yet others exalt him. Ever yielding, yet others honor him first. Knowing strength, he embraces weakness; knowing glory, he embraces disgrace. This is called weakening the will to still it—nothing can then displace it. Firmly grasping it, nothing can overturn it. The unbroken essence, like that of Guangchengzi, lived twelve hundred years without decay—this is called strengthening the bones.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"In harmony with the unknowing, virtue does not depart. In harmony with desirelessness, this is called pristine simplicity. Pristine simplicity, and the people’s nature is preserved.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s governance seeks only to let the people preserve their nature. Excessive knowledge disrupts the appointed nature and fate; excessive desire drowns their natural inclinations. This is called governance, yet what chaos is greater?\n\nThus it is said: *\"Keep the people in a state of wu zhi and wu yu, so that the learned dare not act, the eloquent dare not speak, the brave dare not display their strength, the capable dare not boast of their talents, the clever dare not scheme, and those who pride themselves on cleverness and cunning dare not multiply laws to exploit the people.\"* The Sage prohibits and stops all this—this is called *\"the learned dare not act.\"*\n\nWhen the Nine Virtues are fully cultivated and the talented are in their proper offices, is this not because knowledge is not prized? Simply executing the ruler’s commands and delivering them to the people—then there is nothing that cannot be governed.\n\nThe Sage’s governance is not about abandoning people and things, suddenly standing alone in a realm of non-action. It is about acting from non-action.\n\nThe transformations of all things occur in the realm of the manifest. The Sage embodies the Dao, standing above all things, unifying their completion, and ordering them. Things arise; follow them to observe their return. Things are born; guide them to their fulfillment. How could there be anything ungoverned?\n\nWhen governance is supreme, the sun, moon, and stars follow their courses. When governance is supreme below, birds, beasts, grasses, and trees each fulfill their nature.\n\nWang Anshi said: *\"Not exalting the worthy prevents contention among the people.\"* Discussing what is meant by *\"not exalting the worthy\"*:\n\nThe Sage’s heart has never sought to subdue the world through the worthy, yet the world submits to him—never without the worthy. If the people of the world are made to serve the world’s affairs, and the worthy are not exalted, then what reliance is there for governance?\n\nThe people, even in infancy, possess a natural inclination toward goodness. If they are not taught by the worthy, they cannot fully illuminate the world’s goodness. Once goodness is clear within oneself, how could the worthy not be revered? Thus, even if the laws and institutions remain, they are sufficient to restrain later chaos. If the worthy are exalted throughout the world, how could the people contend?\n\nHis intent is to make all under heaven clearly understand goodness, yet he does not advocate exalting the worthy. Still, the world is not so uniformly equal, and if the laws of exalting the worthy are abandoned, people may not necessarily understand goodness. Alas, the worthy cannot alone remedy the flaws of the unworthy—who knows the worthy who can make all under heaven sincerely and willingly submit?\n\nQi Huan Gong asked Guan Zhong: *\"If I, alas, reach a point of no return, to whom should I entrust the state?\"* Qi Huan Gong favored Yi Ya, but Guan Zhong said that Yi Ya, whom he did not often consult, was not as loyal as Xi Peng. If one elevates those who forget their superiors and rebel below, what greater harm from exalting the worthy could there be?\n\nSome may say: *\"Is this not what he means? He merely argues against its drawbacks.\"*\n\nThe Sage above does not prize rare and hard-to-obtain goods to the point of disturbing the heart. To exalt the worthy sparks contention; rare goods provoke theft. Both arise from what the heart desires. Thus, the Sage in governance does not command people to exalt the worthy or prize rare goods. If these two things are unseen, then the heart alone may remain undisturbed.\n\nTo exalt the worthy is good, but to prize rare goods invites theft—evil. Why reject both? For good and evil are opposites. Where there is good, there is also its opposite; both must be made to vanish.\n\nThere are two kinds of desire in the world: the desirable desire and the undesirable desire. As Mencius says, the desirable is called good—yet the eye’s delight in color, the ear’s in sound, the nose’s in scent—these are undesirable desires.\n\n*The Explanation of Characters* states: *\"谷 (gǔ) can receive; 欠 (qiàn) signifies lack.\"* That which can receive and endure, yet is not full—this is desire. Laozi says: *\"Do not exalt the worthy, lest the people contend. Do not prize rare goods, lest the people steal. Do not display the desirable, lest the heart be disturbed.\"* These are Laozi’s one-sided, unbalanced words.\n\nThe ancient kings neither exalted the worthy nor despised it; neither prized rare goods nor rejected them; neither displayed the desirable nor concealed it. Yet Laozi’s words speak of the formless Dao: not exalting the worthy prevents burdening oneself with goodness; not prizing rare goods prevents burdening oneself with profit. Only thus can one remain undisturbed by the desirable.\n\nMencius said: *\"The desirable is called good.\"* When goodness accumulates and fills to the divine, reaching this divine state, one no longer sees the desirable. Thus, the Sage’s governance strengthens the bones.\n\nTo empty the heart is to clarify that the worthy are not exalted; to fill the belly is to show that rare goods are not prized; to strengthen the bones is to demonstrate that the desirable is unseen.\n\nThe hearts of people differ in worthiness and unworthiness. If one exalts worthiness and unworthiness, contention arises. Thus, emptying the heart erases the distinction between worthy and unworthy, and so the worthy are not exalted. The belly, which can receive, if filled, makes rare goods mere trifles of food, sound, and color. All that is desirable becomes desire itself. Weakening the will prevents seeking; strengthening the bones ensures stability. Only by having no desires does one not see the desirable, yet remain steadfast. To have no desires yet stand firm—this is what the noble value.\n\nIf one constantly makes the people ignorant and desireless, empties their hearts, weakens their wills, and fills their bellies while strengthening their bones, the people will have no knowledge or desires. Even the wise will dare not act. If all the people are without knowledge or desire, even the wise among them will not dare to act. To act without action is to govern without fail. To act yet do nothing, to do nothing yet achieve all—this is the Sage’s way of *wuwei*, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nSu Yingbin said: *\"Not exalting the worthy prevents contention; strengthening the bones is the end.\"* If the worthy are exalted, the people will shame themselves for not measuring up and thus contend. If rare goods are prized, the people will suffer from lack and thus steal. If the desirable is displayed, the people will suffer from not obtaining it and thus rebel. Yet though the world knows these three as afflictions, if one seeks to abolish them outright, it is delusion.\n\nThe Sage does not act thus. Though the worthy are used, they are not exalted; though rare goods exist, they are not prized; though desirable things are present, they are not displayed. Thus, the worthy are employed yet the people do not contend; rare goods and desirable matters are before them, yet theft and chaos do not arise. Is this not the result of emptying the heart yet not filling the belly, weakening the will yet not harming the bones?\n\nNow, if one were to exalt and display the worthy, treasure and prize goods, and flaunt the desirable, then both heart and belly would be filled. If one were to abolish them outright, then will and bones would weaken. When heart and belly are full, the people contend. When will and bones are weak, there is no foundation to stand upon.\n\nIf one constantly makes the people ignorant and desireless to the point where they dare not act, and does not flaunt these three things, then the people will know nothing to covet, their desires will be tranquil, and even the clever will have no schemes. To act without action is to govern without fail. This is to follow the natural course of these three things while neither exalting, prizing, nor displaying them—this is *wuwei*.\n\nLü Jifu said: *\"Not exalting the worthy prevents contention.\"* The Sage knows that beauty is also ugliness, goodness also ungoodness, yet holds no private favor. Though he bestows all under heaven’s titles, he simply assigns duties, and the worthy are not exalted. The people’s contention always arises from comparing themselves to others in worthiness. Knowing the worthy are not exalted by the ruler, they do not contend.\n\n*\"Not prizing rare goods prevents theft.\"* Gathering all under heaven’s wealth is merely to nourish the people, yet rare goods are not prized. The people’s theft always arises from greed. Knowing goods are not prized by the ruler, they do not steal.\n\n*\"Not displaying the desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.\"* Confucius said: *\"If a man does not desire it, even if rewarded, he will not steal.\"* The desires of the noble are for the worthy alone.\n\nThe petty man’s desires are for wealth alone.\nIf I do not show what is desirable to him, then his heart will not be disturbed.\n\nYet this is not to abandon the worthy and leave them unused in the wilds,\nNor to discard rare goods and abandon them on the ground.\nIt is simply that within, they are not cherished in the heart,\nAnd without, their traces are not left behind.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance strengthens the bones.\nThe heart houses the spirit, and the abdomen is the heart’s dwelling.\nTo empty the heart is to preserve the spirit, and the abdomen becomes full.\nThe bones house the will, and the bones are the remnants of the kidneys.\nTo weaken the will is to steady the essence, and the bones grow strong.\n\nIf one always keeps the people without knowledge and without desire,\nThen there will be nothing that is not governed.\n\nThe wise know that the worthy are not prized by the ruler,\nAnd that wealth is not valued by him,\nAnd that serving him brings no gain—\nThus, they dare not act.\n\nOnly thus can there be non-action and yet nothing remain ungoverned.\n\nMaster Lu the Farmer said:\n*\"Not prizing the worthy prevents contention among the people.\nAbandon wisdom and discard knowledge, and the people’s profit increases a hundredfold.\nAbandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and kindness.\nThis is what is meant by not prizing the worthy, so the people do not contend;\nNot valuing rare goods, so the people do not steal.\nAbandon cleverness and discard profit, and thieves and robbers will cease.\nThis is what is meant by not valuing rare goods.\nNot showing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.\nIf the people do not see goodness as desirable, then there will be no contention and disorder.\nIf they do not see profit as desirable, then there will be no theft and disorder.\nThus, when the Sage’s governance is complete, there will be nothing that is not governed.\n\nThe heart has knowledge and makes choices,\nThe abdomen has no knowledge but contains,\nThe will has desires and moves,\nThe bones have no desires but stand firm.\nTherefore, the Sage’s governance empties the heart,\nFills the abdomen,\nWeakens the will,\nStrengthens the bones.\nEmpties what has knowledge,\nFills what has no knowledge—\nThus, the people can always be kept without knowledge.\nWeakens what has desires,\nStrengthens what has no desires—\nThus, the people can always be kept without desire.\"*\n\nMaster Wang Yuanze said:\n*\"Not prizing the worthy prevents contention among the people.\nThe worthy are those who excel among others—\nIf they are prized, the people will boast and emulate them from afar,\nAnd contention will arise.\nNot valuing rare goods prevents theft among the people.\nWhen the people’s clothing and food are sufficient, their nature settles.\nIf rare goods are falsely prized, their pursuit will never cease,\nAnd they will inevitably turn to theft.\nIndeed, the people’s loss of their nature comes from false distinctions.\nThis chapter seeks to equalize all things,\nSo the people may return to their true nature.\nNot showing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.\nThe ignorant falsely perceive what is desirable,\nWhich causes the heart’s dissolution and disorder.\nOnly the Sage knows that all things are not truly real,\nThus viewing all appearances with equal indifference and without preference.\nTherefore, the heart’s mirror remains undisturbed,\nAnd how can external things disorder it?\nThus, the Sage can neither prize the worthy nor value wealth.\nEmptying the heart means no distinctions are made—\nThis further explains *not prizing the worthy*.\nFilling the abdomen means nothing is sought or valued—\nThis further explains *not valuing rare goods*.\nStrengthening the will leads to boasting and striving for victory,\nWeakening the will means no scheming for external gain—\nThis again explains *not prizing the worthy*.\nStrengthening the bones is for self-establishment,\nAnd when one stands firm, external things cannot sway them—\nThis again explains *not valuing rare goods*.\nAlways keeping the people without knowledge and without desire:\nKnowledge leads to false perceptions,\nDesire leads to external seeking—\nOnce these are removed, nature and emotion settle.\nIf one does not prize the worthy and transforms them,\nThey can be made to reach a state of no desire.\nThus, the wise will not dare to act.\nThose whose wisdom disrupts the masses should be restrained and stopped.\nNon-action, yet nothing remains ungoverned—\nNon-action is not true inaction; action lies in not acting,\nWith the aim of restoring their true nature.\n\nExamining this closely, after the Three Dynasties,\nThere were no people who did not lose their true nature.\nThus, the noble strengthened their will and loved goodness,\nSeeking the worthy without end;\nThe petty weakened their bones and craved profit,\nChasing wealth without satisfaction.\nStrengthening the will leads to excessive knowledge,\nWeakening the bones leads to excessive desire—\nWhether one has knowledge or desire,\nThough their pursuits differ, their harm to their true nature is the same.\nThe Sage is not thus.\nWeakening the will means rejecting what is seen,\nLowering oneself to seek what is near,\nAnd considering oneself as having no desires,\nWhile the Dao suffices within.\nStrengthening the bones is not for self-establishment as the worthy,\nBut to overcome desires for profit,\nAnd to honor innate virtue.\nOnly then can fame not sway them,\nProfit not drown them,\nAnd their nature remain steadfast.\"*\n\nMaster Liu Zhongping said:\n*\"Not prizing the worthy reaches the point where the people do not steal.\nNot prizing the worthy prevents contention among the people.\nNot valuing rare goods prevents theft among the people.\nThis is the ancient Way.\nCan the sages of later generations also restore it?\nIt is easy to not value rare goods,\nBut difficult to not prize those called ‘worthy.’\nIt is a matter of timing.\nYet there is a method to prizing the worthy.\nOnly when they are truly worthy should they be prized,\nAnd yet none should be valued above others.\nThus, the world will trust this,\nAnd contention will cease.\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n‘Not treasuring distant goods makes distant people respectful.’\nThis is not valuing wealth.\nWhat is treasured is only the worthy,\nThen near people are content—\nThis is prizing the worthy.\nDistant people respectful means the people do not steal.\nNear people content means the people do not contend.\nNot showing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.\nWhat is desirable is goodness,\nWhat is not desired is not-goodness.\nThe Sage guides people with what is desirable,\nAnd thus desire ceases.\nWhat is desirable is understanding principle,\nWithout desire is fulfilling nature.\nWhat is desirable can be spoken of to begin with people,\nBut cannot be demanded of them to the end.\nTo end with what is desirable is also to return to what is not-good.\nLaozi said:\n‘Not showing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.\nWhat is desirable is goodness,\nThus it is said: *All under heaven know goodness as goodness,\nAnd thus what is not-good already exists.*’\"*\n\n「To know the reason why goodness is goodness, one must deeply understand this truth.\n\nThus, when the Sage’s governance reaches its peak, there is nothing left ungoverned.\nTo empty one’s heart is to extinguish the love of evil,\nAnd when the love of evil ceases, one’s resolve becomes tranquil and unified with the Dao.\nEmptying the heart and weakening the resolve is how one nurtures the spirit.\nFilling the belly and strengthening the bones is how one preserves one’s vital essence.\n\nYet the Sage always ensures the people have no knowledge and no desire.\nThe common people, once they know desire, cannot naturally rid themselves of it—\nOnly the Sage can make them so.\nTo empty the heart and weaken the resolve is to make them without knowledge;\nTo fill the belly and strengthen the bones is to make them without desire.\n\nMoreover, the Sage ensures the people always abide by goodness.\nFor those who know, shame prevents wrongdoing—\nWhen the Sage does not exalt virtue, yet the people contend, or when they covet wealth and steal,\nIt is because the Sage makes those who know dare not act.\nIf the people always abide by goodness, then even those who know dare not act—\nAnd if they dare not act, this is truly the Dao.\n\nThe Sage does not speak of desire,\nFor desire arises from knowledge itself.\nTo act with *wu wei* (non-action) is to ensure nothing remains ungoverned.\nTo act with *wu wei* means to make those who dare act refrain from doing so.\nWhen those who dare act refrain, the people without knowledge and desire find peace in their nature—\nThis is how the Sage governs.\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of the Sage using affairs and teaching as what should be done,\nAnd exaltation of virtue and valuing wealth are merely remnants of such teaching—\nHence the next step: not to exalt virtue.\nThis chapter speaks of the Sage governing himself to transform the people,\nMaking them reach a state of no knowledge and no desire—\nThen virtue and wealth are but external matters.\n\nIn later ages, when exaltation of virtue and valuing wealth cannot be abandoned,\nYet if the ruler can empty his heart and weaken his resolve,\nEven if he complies with self-interest and merely exhausts the people to feed them,\nFilling the belly and strengthening the bones will make valuing wealth difficult—\nHe must not enrich himself at the expense of others,\nNor hoard jade and pearls to bring ruin upon himself.\nIf this is so, then those who govern the people will feed them—\nWho would make them contend?\nIf there is abundance yet no scarcity,\nAnd boundaries are fixed, who would make them steal?\n\nThe *Chongning* commentary states:\n*\"When the Sage does not exalt virtue, the people do not contend, and thus all under heaven is governed without fail.*\nHuman beings are born in stillness—\nThis is the nature of Heaven.\nWhen moved by external things, desire arises—\nThis is the nature of humanity.\nThe Sage in power does not exalt virtue nor value wealth,\nSo the people are not burdened by striving for goodness or profit.\nIf the heart is not emptied, it becomes disturbed;\nIf the belly is not filled, desire arises;\nIf the resolve is not weakened, rigidity remains;\nIf the bones are not strengthened, the body cannot stand.\nTo fill the belly is to have no craving for desire.\nMencius said:\n*'If an action does not satisfy the heart, one must not do it.'*\nAnd again:\n*'When people have no hunger or thirst, the heart is still their greatest affliction.'*\nZhuangzi said:\n*'The deeper one’s love of song, the shallower one’s connection to Heaven’s vital mechanism—\nShallowness brings constraint.'*\nTo weaken the resolve is to not exhaust one’s *qi*.\nAnd again:\n*'The scholar holds fast to his resolve.'*\nBut why does this text speak of weakening the resolve?\nMencius spoke of this in terms of the scholar’s conduct,\nSo I advance it.\nLaozi spoke of this in terms of returning to the origin,\nSo I retreat it.\n\nLiu Ji said:\n*\"When the Sage does not exalt virtue, the people do not contend, and thus all under heaven is governed without fail.*\nNot to exalt virtue is to forget reputation,\nAnd when reputation is forgotten, the people have nothing to boast or aspire to—\nThus they do not contend.\nNot to value wealth is to forget profit,\nAnd when profit is forgotten, the people have nothing to covet—\nThus they do not steal.\nNot to show what is desirable is to make people rest their hearts from love and desire—\nThus they remain undisturbed.\nWhen these three evils are removed, nature and emotion are settled.\nThen one can empty the heart and fill the belly.\nTo empty the heart is to forget both self and external things;\nTo fill the belly is to preserve one’s spirit within.\nTo forget both self and external things is to have no desires or thoughts—\nAnd thus the resolve naturally weakens.\nTo preserve one’s spirit within is to have a robust body—\nAnd thus the bones naturally strengthen.\nTo weaken the resolve is to value the state of no knowledge;\nTo strengthen the bones is to value the state of no desire.\nHence, the Sage always ensures the people have no knowledge and no desire.\nWhen the people have no knowledge and no desire,\nThey embrace simplicity and purity, and are thus born into the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s Dao is empty and natural, beyond contrivance.\nTo contrive is to ruin it; to grasp is to lose it—\nThus the wise dare not act at all.\n\nTo act without acting,\nThen what is done arises from non-action,\nAnd the marvelous workings of Nature\nLeave nothing untended.\n\nThis is what Zhuangzi called:\n*\"Let the heart wander in simplicity,\nMerge the qi with emptiness,\nFollow things in their natural course,\nAnd harbor no private schemes—\nThen the world is governed,\nFor it has attained the Dao’s boundless, void-like power.\"*\n\nThus, the next step is to align with the Dao’s path.\n\nZhao Shiyuan remarked:\n*\"First, do not employ clever stratagems.\nOne: Eliminate rhetoric and sophistry.\nDo not exalt the worthy, lest the people contend.\"*\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of the Sage’s non-action governing the world,\nYet when the work is done and not claimed,\nIt is the true, eternal function at play.\nHow could it rely on external force?\n\nThus, the Sage is not necessarily transcendent—\nFor there is no such thing as the Sage.\nThe wise are not discarded—\nFor there is no such thing as wisdom.\nOnly emptiness of mind remains.\n\nObserve the Three Dynasties onward—\nNo one spoke of non-action.\nThus, they packed provisions for a thousand-li journey,\nSought worthy advisors to plan governance.\n\nLaozi lamented their failure to grasp the root,\nSo he followed with *\"Do not exalt the worthy.\"*\n\nTo entrust great matters does not mean entrusting small ones.\nTo be a Sage does not mean being merely worthy.\nThe great embodies the Dao’s non-action—\nThis is the Sage’s affair.\nThe small relies on cleverness and boasting—\nThis is the worthy’s affair.\n\nThus, the great Sage acts,\nGoverned by non-action’s root,\nLetting the people each find their natural state,\nAnd severing the hearts of ambition, rivalry, and contention.\n\nAs the *Yijing* says:\n*\"The Way of Heaven’s transformation—\nEach returns to their true nature.\"*\n\nWhen nature is rectified,\nIt remains pure and constant,\nWith no scheming mind—\nThen who could distinguish the worthy from the unworthy?\n\nIf I wish for non-action,\nI dull their ears and eyes;\nIf I wish for governance,\nI unify their sincere hearts.\n\nWhen cleverness arises, deceit follows;\nWhen cunning intentions form, contention stirs.\nWhen these shift,\nHow could they surpass governance?\n\nThe middle way of human nature can rise or fall—\nGuided by the Dao, it returns to purity;\nLured by the worthy, it advances to contention.\nContention breeds contention—\nThe people’s nature shifts.\n\nThough one might exalt the worthy,\nYet forbidding the people from knowing too much\nIs not the same as nurturing true understanding,\nNor is it the same as teaching falsehood as virtue.\n\nThus, *\"Do not exalt the worthy\"*—\nThis is the operation of the most divine.\n\nIn the ancient times, rulers heard no mention of ministers.\nEven the succession of Xīn and Nóng had none.\nYet when Huangdi fought at Yǒuqí,\nWind Master and Strength Master first appeared as ministers,\nAnd when asked about governance,\nHe had More Area and Qi Bo as teachers.\nLater, though the Sage’s Way still lingered,\nThe demand for assistance grew urgent.\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"South has fine fish—\nThen music and the worthy are cherished.\"*\n*\"South Mountain has a terrace—\nThen music and the worthy are rejoiced in.\"*\nYet in *\"The Simple One,\"*\nIt criticizes the neglect of the worthy.\n*\"In the Hills There Is Hemp\"*\nCriticizes the exile of the worthy.\n*\"The Sly Boy\"*\nCriticizes not consulting the worthy in affairs.\nThus, when Great Simplicity had scattered,\nThe worthy could not be neglected.\n\nLaozi, in the declining Zhou,\nWished to restore purity and return to simplicity,\nSo he spoke of *\"not exalting the worthy.\"*\nNot for any other reason—\nLet the people be pure and simple, and they will not contend;\nLet the people value things lightly, and they will not covet.\n\nIn all, it was to remedy the ills of his time.\n\nThus, exalting the worthy and employing the capable\nWere the ancient kings’ establishment of proper rites, morality, laws, and institutions.\nNot exalting the worthy, not employing the capable—\nLaozi sought quietude and non-action.\n\nThough their paths differed,\nTheir governance was one.\n\nThus, carrying a jar to water the garden,\nAnswering Zǐgōng’s inquiry;\nPlowing fields without seeking office,\nFleeing Bóchéng’s pursuit.\nAnd *\"Horsehoof\"* and *\"The Thief\"*—\nAll were scorned by the common people.\n\nTwo: Eliminate love of gain.\nDo not prize hard-to-obtain goods,\nLest the people become thieves.\nDo not exalt the worthy,\nLest the people contend.\nDo not display desirable things,\nLest the heart be disordered.\n\nThis passage is called *\"The Three Laws of Mysterious Unity.\"*\nThe first two sentences speak of governance;\nThe last speaks of self-cultivation.\n\nFirst, master the way of self-cultivation,\nThen one may govern the people.\n\nTo govern is to rectify—\nRectified, there is no deviation;\nNo deviation, there is no desire;\nNo desire, the heart is empty;\nAn empty heart does not stray;\nWhen none stray, all things submit;\nWhen all submit, clever schemes are unnecessary.\n\nWhat need is there for the worthy?\n\nGoods are exchanged for mutual benefit,\nAnd sustenance for self and others is complete—\nThough gold and jade may be prized,\nThey cannot fill hunger.\nGuided by the Dao, each receives their due,\nWithout letting the low usurp the high,\nOr the poor overpower the rich.\nIf there is competition,\nThen nature’s true state is violated,\nAnd they boast of strange, extravagant things.\n\nThis must lie in the ruler’s reverence for simplicity,\nNot indulging in splendor.\nWhen the people of the world transform without coercion,\nLike Han Wen’s return of the thousand-li horse,\nOr Jin Wu’s burning of the pheasant-feather robe,\nThen the world’s love of goods is already stirred.\n\nThus, perfect governance does not rely on the three treasures.\n\nHanzi said:\n*\"The essential Way resides in the four cardinal virtues.\"*\nJia Yi’s extreme argument:\n*\"Cultivate the self with no desire,\nThen the mind has no affairs—\nNo affairs, then tranquility arises.\"*\n\nThus, the clever dare not boast of their wisdom,\nThe capable dare not boast of their talents—\nWho could then cater to their preferences?\n\nFormer rulers did not embody the ultimate Way,\nBut sought to outdo others with desires,\nAnd deceitful ministers gained favor by indulging them—\nNone escaped ruin through this path.\n\nTai Jia said:\n*\"Desire destroys measures, enslaves the ears and eyes—\nThis is what desire does.\"*\nDuke Zou also said:\n*\"Following desire is called the Way—\nExhausting it utterly.\"*\n\nIf one follows what others desire,\nWithout restraint or limit,\nThen the world’s Way is exhausted by indulgence.\n\nThe Sage’s governance—\nIf one can eliminate desire and empty the heart,\nThen the divine mind shines brightly,\nKnowing the four directions is not far.\n\n**III. Rectifying Nature and Emotions**\n\nTo see nothing desirable,\nSo that the heart remains undisturbed.\nThis means not letting any single thing weigh upon the heart—\nThen the heart itself will be without attachment.\n\nWhen one speaks of \"seeing,\" it is not merely seeing with the eyes.\nThe six senses all perceive;\nFrom perception arises desire,\nAnd excessive desire disturbs the heart—\nThe heart is inherently impure.\n\nNow, the eye is the foremost of the six senses.\nThough called the \"seeing root,\" the eye itself perceives,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing* (境).\nThough the ear is said to \"listen,\" listening is truly a form of seeing,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.\nThough the nose is said to \"smell,\" smelling is truly a form of seeing,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.\nThough the tongue is said to \"taste,\" tasting is truly a form of seeing,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.\nThough the body is said to \"touch,\" touching is truly a form of seeing,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.\nThough the mind is said to \"discern,\" discernment is truly a form of seeing,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.\n\nThis is called the six senses (*liùgēn* 六根).\nThe six senses generate six dusts (*liùchén* 六塵),\nAnd the six dusts correspond to six *jing*s—\nThis is called the thirty-six *jie* (界) and eighty-one *lún* (輪) of rebirth,\nThe causal conditions of birth and death.\n\nThough the objects of awareness differ,\nThey are all called *awareness*.\nThough the objects of perception differ,\nThey are all called *perception*.\n\nThe six desires arise from the same mind,\nAnd from the mind’s tendencies,\nThe three realms are but a single *shi* (識).\n\nThe six senses take in *jing*s,\nStoring them in the mind—\nThe mind itself is the *zang* (藏) of *shi*.\nThe six senses are called the six *shi*,\nWith seven added above, totaling eight.\n\nThe seven *shi* are those that,\nFor the six *shi*, manage their functions and return to the eighth *shi*,\nAlso called *yi* (意).\nThe eighth *shi* holds the three *zang* (能藏, 所藏, 藏执),\nAnd depends on all defiled and pure *dharma*s—\nThus it is called *zǐ* (種子).\n\nThe seven and eight *shi* are both called *yi* or *xin* (心).\nThus, the six desires defile and disturb one’s true nature—\nNature is the birth of the heart,\nAnd the heart is the true nature itself.\n\nFrom beginningless time,\nYou have prevented me from returning to the true Dao,\nBecause of your six *shi*’s insatiable grasping,\nCausing this heart to ceaselessly labor,\nChasing the winds of love,\nNever pausing in its frenzy.\n\nBetween looking up and down,\nIt flutters beyond the four seas,\nLike a lamp flame in the wind, never still—\nThus, like disordered threads in the wind,\nIt cannot be tamed.\n\nWhen the heart is not mastered,\nIt follows *jing*s endlessly,\nTurning without rest,\nExhausting the spirit,\nDaily drifting into delusion,\nTransforming into strange forms,\nWith no way to return to its origin.\n\nHow grave is desire’s harm to nature—\nShould one not be cautious?\n\nFor desire was not accumulated in a single day,\nNor was nature defiled in a single day—\nWithin lies *wúmíng* (無明), ruling as master.\nFrom beginningless time until now,\nEven from the moment of entering the womb,\nArising from impure *jing*s,\nKarma and retribution are the cause,\nAnd love gives birth.\n\nFrom the moment of entering the womb,\nLove is already present,\nAnd within love lies desire,\nWhich gives rise to this heart.\nBy the time of infancy,\nThough emotions are not yet fully awakened,\nJoy and anger already stir within the heart.\n\nSwiftly, one begins to distinguish affairs,\nAnd the six desires arise,\nSplitting into six *chù* (處),\nUsing one *jing* to receive,\nDesire generating one mind—\nSince the arising *jing*s are boundless,\nThe mind is also boundless.\n\nYet this single mind\nDoes not know where it dwells—\nFor desire prevails, and the heart is disordered.\n\nThus, the three realms’ first six heavens\nAre called the *yùjiè* (欲界).\nThe first, the *Tàihuáng Yǔngzēng Tiān* (太皇黄曾天人),\nHas all six sense-desires defiled.\nThe *Tàimíng Yùwán Tiān* (太明玉完天人),\nHas one sense-desire coarse and pure,\nAnd five coarse and defiled.\nThe *Qīngmíng Hétóng Tiān* (清明何童天人),\nHas two sense-desires coarse and pure,\nAnd four coarse and defiled.\nThe *Xuāntāi Píngyù Tiān* (玄胎平育天人),\nHas three sense-desires coarse and pure,\nAnd three coarse and defiled.\nThe *Míngwén Jǔ Tiān* (明文举天人),\nHas four sense-desires coarse and pure,\nAnd two coarse and defiled.\nThe *Shàngmíng Qīyào Tiān* (上明七曜天人),\nHas five sense-desires coarse and pure,\nAnd one coarse and defiled.\n\nThese six heavens are called the *yùjiè*.\nThe *Tàizhēn Kē* (太真科) says:\nThe first two heavens below are still coarse in retribution,\nWhere even bodily contact is desire.\nThe next two heavens take hand-holding as desire,\nThe fifth takes speech as desire,\nAnd the sixth takes mere sight as desire.\n\nNow, through these six desires,\nOne feels these six heavens.\nFor each sense-desire that is coarse and pure,\nOne ascends to a higher heaven.\nWhen all six desires are transcended,\nOne enters the *sèjiè* (色界).\n\nOnly then does nature fully dissolve,\nAnd one ascends to the *wúsèjiè* (無色界) heavens.\nWhen called \"without color,\" it means \"without desire.\"\n\nIndeed, at the start of cultivation,\nEliminating desire is difficult.\nFrom the six realms to becoming human,\nFrom the human path to sainthood,\nThe gate of transcendence is gradually consumed.\n\nThe *Sutra* says: *\"Few desires, little selfishness,\"*\nThe *Yì* (易) says: *\"Restrain anger, suppress desire.\"*\nThe *Sutra* speaks of gradual refinement,\nThe *Yì* speaks of reduction.\n\nThough scholars cultivate thus,\nThose who harmonize with things like flowing water,\nWithout arising in thought to sever them—\nWithout roots, who has dust?\nWithout dust, who has *jing*s?\nUnderstanding this,\nOne becomes a true person.\n\n**Next, the Essentials of Governance**\n\n**1. [Rectifying the foundation of governance]**\nThus, the Sage’s governance—\nThe first three sentences expound the three methods of profound meaning,\nThe last four sentences establish the four affairs of governance.\n\nThe character *shì* (是以) connects what follows,\nMeaning the Sage understands these three principles,\nAnd practices *xūxīn shífù* (虛心實腹),\n*ruòzhì qiánggǔ* (弱志強骨)—\nThus, the Sage’s path is clearly articulated.\n\nTo not exalt the worthy is to eliminate cleverness and wisdom;\nTo not treasure wealth is to eliminate rare and strange things;\n\nTo see no desirable things, one’s heart finds peace.\nThese three principles form the foundation of governance.\nWithout this foundation, how can one seek stability?\n\nThe art of kingship has long been practiced.\nThese three principles, even the Sage has often heard them.\nTo hear them is to resolve to act upon them,\nAnd their enactment lies in the four affairs.\n\nThus, Zengzi said:\nTo honor what one has heard brings clarity and brilliance,\nTo act upon what one knows brings radiance and grandeur.\nWhat is meant by grandeur is to enact these four affairs:\nThe first is to empty the heart,\nThe second is to fill the belly,\nThe third is to weaken the will,\nThe fourth is to strengthen the bones.\n\n**2. [The Depth of Emptiness]**\n**Emptying the Heart**\nEmptying the heart has four interpretations—three are false, one is true.\nThe first three are incorrect; the fourth alone is correct.\n\nThe first says: *\"Like the emptiness of boundless space.\"*\nThe second says: *\"Like the emptiness of a hollow valley.\"*\nThe third says: *\"Like the emptiness of a tiger on a hill.\"*\nThe fourth says: *\"To regard *One* as emptiness.\"*\n\nThe emptiness of boundless space, of hollow valleys, of a tiger on a hill—\nThese are all incorrect.\nThey cannot be likened to the void of *One*.\nFor if one’s heart is as empty as boundless space,\nEven the solitary awakened may weary of vexation,\nAnd though they bear no burden in their minds,\nSitting to observe the void—\nThe void stretches endlessly, yet nothing can be done.\nHow could the Sage of governance guard such emptiness as true emptiness?\nThis is the first error.\n\nAgain, if one takes the emptiness of a hollow valley as emptiness,\nIt is but a mountain’s hollowed-out cavern.\nThe valley’s resonance echoes with emptiness,\nAnd when sound arises, it too is empty—\nThe two emptinesses merge, and only then do they respond.\nThough this may seem a fine metaphor,\nScripture says: *\"The spirit of the valley does not die.\"*\nWhen we speak of the spirit of the valley,\nWe mean there is a spirit within the valley—\nNot merely an empty hollow.\nIf the valley had no spirit,\nWhat then would be this so-called divine essence?\nWhen I call and it responds in harmony,\nCould there be governance without a leader to initiate it?\nIf there is no leader yet harmony exists,\nThis is unnatural.\nThus, the emptiness of a valley cannot compare\nTo the Sage’s heart of governance.\nThis is the second error.\n\n*The Book of Characters* says: *\"Empty, and the hill becomes empty.\"*\nEmpty, and none dare approach.\nThe affairs of the king encompass the world as one family,\nNot favoring only his kin,\nNot cherishing only his children—\nAll are to be loved and benefited,\nUntil all under heaven turn toward him.\nCould this be likened to a tiger’s isolation on a hill,\nSevering all to create emptiness?\nThis is the third error.\n\nNow, what is spoken of as *One* is indeed emptiness.\n*One* is solid when in *Kàn* (坎), empty when in *Lì* (离).\nWater and fire generate each other—\nThe movement of spirit and essence\nCannot for an instant be separated.\nThus, the Sage’s movement of spirit and the workings of the heart\nFollow the unfathomable patterns of water and fire—\n*One* is their origin.\nThe Dao produces *One*, and *One* is emptiness,\nNot generating yet the source of all generation,\nWithout use yet the ancestor of all utility.\n*One* is the sovereign—\nIn the *Xiàng* (象), three strokes form *Qián* (乾),\nAnd three threes, two twos—\nThe three powers transform and adapt.\nFrom *One* to three, to six,\nUp to the three hundred eighty-four lines—\n*One* encompasses all.\n\n*One* is the divine.\nTo respond to emptiness with emptiness is useless—\nYet is it truly useless?\nThe Sage’s Way enslaves others without being enslaved,\nCommands things without being commanded—\n*One* without a second,\nMastering fate.\nThe *Han Stratagems* say: *\"Fate\"*—\nOnly the Sage can enact it.\n*One* without disorder is the utmost stillness.\nStillness without change is the constant of the Way.\nChange without change is the function of the Way.\nWhen things change and I remain still, I guard *One*.\nWhen I remain still and things move, I observe their return.\nThus, *One* is non-action,\nYet non-action is not non-doing.\nThe sovereign’s heart penetrates the Three Mysteries,\nEnacting the four affairs—\nWho would say emptiness and non-being are not governance?\nThis is the truth of *One* as emptiness.\n\n**3. [The Dao is Fully *Qián*]**\n**Filling the Belly**\nThe eight trigrams regard *Kùn* (坤) as the belly,\nFor it transforms into the five materials—\nOn earth, forming shape, *Kùn* is the storehouse,\nThus it is called the belly.\nAgain, the back is *yáng* (阳), the belly is *yīn* (阴),\nAnd since it governs storage,\nIt holds what has passed—\nThus, it is the belly.\n\nEarth governs intention, issuing forth as new,\nReturning as what has passed—\nAll govern storage.\nBecause it holds much, it is called *filling the belly*.\n\nAgain, observing the two symbols *Kàn* (坎) and *Lì* (离),\n*Kàn* is filled within—\nIt bears the symbol of a filled belly,\n*Lì* is empty in heart—\nIt bears the symbol of an empty heart.\n*Kàn* is firm, *Lì* is yielding—\nThus, the heart and belly are firm and yielding.\n\nScripture says: *\"Man follows Earth,\"*\nAnd the *Yì* says: *\"The way of standing on Earth is yielding and firm.\"*\nYet what is solid without emptiness to permeate it\nLacks divinity,\nThus it is said: *\"Yellow Center, the harmony of principles.\"*\nIf emptiness does not tread upon solidity,\nIt cannot reach the pure, clear, awakened state.\n\nThe Commentary says:\nAn empty heart listens impartially and observes without bias,\nFree of likes and dislikes—\nThis is the birth of clarity.\n*Lì* is fire, the fire of enlightenment—\nThe Sage faces south to govern the world.\nA filled belly is abundant and tranquil,\nWithout covetous desires,\nIts capacity is public—\n*Kùn* is the belly, and the belly governs receptivity—\nThe Sage’s central rectitude in observing the world is thus.\n\nWhat was previously discussed—\nEmptying the heart, filling the belly—\nReveals the Sage’s governance in action.\n\nThe functions of emptiness and fullness\nIn humans are affairs,\nIn the trigrams are *Kàn* and *Lì*,\nIn *qi* are *yīn* and *yáng*.\nTheir application in human affairs is as described,\nYet their application in *Kàn* and *Lì* differs in law.\n\nMoreover, *yáng* is full, *yīn* is empty—\nThe alchemical method refines the two *bā* (八) of *yīn*,\nExtending the nine *sān* (三) of *yáng*—\nWhen *yáng* is pure, one becomes immortal;\nWhen *yīn* is pure, one dies.\n*Kàn*’s interior and exterior are *yīn*,\n*Lì*’s interior and exterior are *yáng*—\nFire above, water below is *Unfinished* (未济),\nDescending fire to meet water is *Completed* (既济).\n\nFrom the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nFrom *Zǐ* to *Wǔ* it shifts to pure *yáng*,\nFrom *Wǔ* to *Hài* it shifts to pure *yīn*—\nThis is the natural course of things.\n\nThus it is said:\nHeaven and Earth move in accordance with the Way,\nThis is the constant method by which they transform.\n\nYet in the human body,\nDoes it not follow Heaven and Earth’s *yīn* and *yáng*?\n\nTo follow Heaven and Earth’s *yīn* and *yáng*\nIs yet to have not attained the method of *zhì* (制).\nOne cannot but drift along with *zào huà* (造化),\nNot knowing that the power to govern life lies within oneself.\n\nThe Dao of *yīn* and *yáng*:\nTo follow it leads to death,\nTo oppose it leads to life.\n\nThe Master of Taibai said:\n*\"Five Phases in Reverse—*\n*The Dragon emerges from fire.*\n*Five Phases not in order—*\n*The Tiger is born in water.*\nThis is opposition—\nOpposition brings life.\"\n\nThe *Tàishàng* (太上) speaks thus:\n*\"Water and fire align with the true substance of the Dao.*\n*Their application is governed by technique,*\n*So that the one *bǔ* (补) within *Kàn* fills *Lì*’s empty heart,*\n*Transforming *Lì* into *Qián*—*\n*Thus the Dao is complete.*\n*If the heart remains empty,*\n*Then *Lì* and *Kàn* are but lost in confusion.*\n*The True Person says:*\n*‘*Kàn*’s *yīn* is lost in confusion,*\n*One *yáng* in *Lì* reveals its form.’*\n*Píngshū (平叔) says:*\n*‘*Point-transformation within *Lì*’s palace,*\n*Deep in the *yīn* of the belly.’*\n*Ultimately, it rests in attaining the One.*\n*Once the One is attained,*\n*It depends on the fire’s timing—*\n*If the fire’s timing is insufficient,*\n*How could it be supplemented?*\n\nSome say:\n*The Classics do not extend this far,*\n*Only discussing the Sage’s governance.*\n*How then does this relate?*\n*They do not know that the Five Thousand Words*\n*Are the essence of longevity.*\n*Applied outwardly, they govern the world,*\n*Applied inwardly, they lead to immortality.*\n*Anqi Sheng was a strategist,*\n*Zhang Zifang a kingmaker—*\n*Anqi was not employed by Chu,*\n*Zhang achieved great success in Han,*\n*Yet both ascended to immortality—*\n*This is the Dao of withdrawal and engagement.*\n*How could the ignorant comprehend this?*\n\n**Four: Gentle Submission and Self-Cultivation.**\n*Weaken the will.*\nMencius said:\n*\"The will is the commander of *qi*.*\n*The Commentary states:*\n*The strong-willed may pursue fame without rest,*\n*Or chase wealth without satisfaction.*\n*Now, those who rush or retreat—*\n*This is *qi* in motion.*\n*If *qi* is made harmonious,*\n*Internally it calms the spirit,*\n*Externally it does not oppose things.*\n*If not harmonious,*\n*How could it avoid clenching fists and harming others,*\n*Or raging and offending people?*\n*It is not *qi* acting of itself—*\n*The will commands it.*\n*Thus it is said:*\n*The will is the commander of *qi*.*\n\n*Laozi* takes meekness and humility as the standard,\nSaying the will must not be strong.\nYet in terms of governance,\nIf will and intent are not vast,\nAnd understanding is not far-reaching,\nHow could one handle great matters?\nOne must be firm—\nFirmness resolves softness.\nIs it not that firmness alone is not enough?\nSoftness returns to firmness.\nThe Sage embodies Heaven’s alternating firmness and softness,\nEach giving rise to the other.\nIf not decisive, it is not firm;\nIf firm, the Dao of *Qián* is complete.\nYet if firmness is excessive and unbalanced,\nExcess brings regret.\n*Qián*’s *yǔ* (用) of Nine\nReveals Heaven’s pattern—\nThose who can employ Nine\nAre said to have a weak will.\nYang Xiong said:\n*\"Seeing virtue and acting clearly—*\n*The firm see virtue and clarify the Dao.*\n*If the Dao is clear within me,*\n*Then will and *qi* naturally grow vast.*\n*In the gentleman, this is guarded with caution,*\n*Hidden as if empty.*\n*Thus it is guarded with weakness.*\n*If one cannot guard it with weakness,*\n*Then *qi* erupts and becomes impure.*\n\nThe Dao of nurturing *qi*\nFinds its foundation in gentleness.\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Joyful as winter crossing a river,*\n*As if fearing the neighbors.\"*\n*So that the inner does not violate the outer,*\n*Like a maiden in seclusion—*\n*Otherwise, joy and anger attack each other,*\n*And the harmony is injured.*\n*The essence of longevity*\n*Is most cautious here.*\n\nWhy not observe *Qián*’s Nine-Five—\n*The Flying Dragon in Heaven,*\n*Firmness in its proper place—*\n*Advancing without excess,*\n*For excess brings regret.*\n*Dàyóu*’s Upper Nine\n*Should be firm yet balanced.*\n*Yet it follows sincerity and thinks of compliance,*\n*Thus Heaven aids it—*\n*Good fortune without hindrance.*\n\nStill, this is timing,\nYet nature lies within it.\nIf one weakens the will to guard the One,\nUnless one attends to it with *qi*,\nIt will surely reverse itself.\n\n**Five: Establishing Virtue and Clarifying the Dao.**\n*Strengthen the bones.*\nWhat was previously called *\"not valuing the worthy\"*\nAnd *\"the able knowing\"*—\n*Peace of heart and below,*\n*These four are the able in action.*\n*But to strengthen the bones*\n*Truly reveals the able.*\n\nHow so?\n*Strong bones stand firm.*\n*The Classic says:*\n*\"Sincerity issues from the will.\"*\n*Mastering sincerity brings firmness.*\n*Again it says:*\n*\"Heaven’s movement is vigorous,*\n*The gentleman strengthens himself without rest.\"*\n*Embodying *Qián*’s Dao,*\n*He moves without obstruction,*\n*Acts without haste—*\n*Sincerity governs it.*\n*Without sincerity, one does not stand.*\n*This is what the supremely firm and great can practice.*\n\n*From peace of heart and filling the belly,*\n*To weakening the will in cultivation,*\n*Until here—*\n*This is nurturing the vast *hàorán* (浩然) *qi*,*\n*Filling Heaven and Earth,*\n*So mighty it cannot be uprooted.*\n*Who could resist it?*\n*The Classic says:*\n*\"The resolute have will.\"*\n*This is first cultivating with softness,*\n*Then attaining supreme firmness.*\n*The Classic employs firmness before softness,*\n*Laozi employs softness before firmness—*\n*Each has its proper application.*\n\n*The kidneys are one water, one stone—*\n*Water is soft, symbolizing the will,*\n*Stone is firm, symbolizing the bones.*\n*From softness to firmness,*\n*The transition is clearly seen:*\n*One *yáng* arises in the depths of extreme *yīn*—*\n*Softness at its extreme becomes firm.*\n*One *yīn* arises in the depths of extreme *yáng*—*\n*Firmness at its extreme becomes soft.*\n*Thus one knows the alternating use of firmness and softness.*\n\n*If one holds to this without acting,*\n*It is called self-obscuring.*\n*Self-obscuring—*\n*How could it benefit the world and future generations?*\n\n*The Sage observes Heaven’s Dao,*\n*Prepares with compliance,*\n*Wind, thunder, clouds, and rain applied in Heaven,*\n*Rites, music, punishments, and governance applied in humanity—*\n*Yet internally, one must not be firm to stand alone.*\n\nThe bones grow strong to stand firm,\nYet weakness guards them,\nAnd uprightness guides their movement.\n\nIf one stands outstandingly erect,\nThen it differs from the roots of desire.\n\nObserve how many scholars of the Dao there are in the world—\nSome know it, yet cannot guard it;\nGuard it, yet cannot act upon it.\nThere is no other reason—\nFor the heart’s desire for gain overpowers,\nAnd the Way of clarity and emptiness becomes difficult to return to.\n\nStrengthen the will yet weaken the bones—\nLike hoarding wealth without trade,\nShutting doors to guard it,\nYet unable to exchange it—\nHow then could one grow rich?\n\n**Commentary:** *\"The bones grow strong, yet their movement scatters and shifts—*\n*This is to say there is no steadiness below.\"*\n\nOnly those who persist in self-strengthening\nCan truly embody this.\n\nThe Three Governments’ teachings reach far—\nEver making the people without knowledge, without desire.\nThis sentence summarizes the preceding meaning,\nWhile the next demonstrates the method.\n\nEver make the people without knowledge, without desire—\nThis is to emphasize:\n*\"Do not value the worthy,\nDo not prize wealth,\nDo not show what is desirable,\"*\nThus achieving a hollow heart and full belly,\nA weak will and strong bones.\nThe Sage, governing the world, relies on these seven principles—\nNothing else is needed—\nMaking the people without knowledge, without desire.\n\nTo value the worthy brings excessive knowledge,\nUntil the world is in uproar—\nConfucians and Mohists arise in chaos.\nTo prize wealth brings excessive desire,\nUntil one risks life and nature for gain,\nSeizing and deceiving without restraint.\nTo see names and profits as desirable—\nAll are deviations from the Dao.\n\nOnly the Sage can abandon these three,\nAnd thus the people naturally have no knowledge,\nNor any desire.\n\nYet human nature is thick,\nAnd circumstances shift with things.\nFor those above, cleverness and artifice\nAre taught and refined—\nBut when carried to excess,\nLaws and punishments cannot correct them.\n\n**Master Dong said:**\n*\"When laws are issued, deceit arises;\nWhen orders are given, fraud follows.\"*\nThis stems from past rulers’ poor instruction,\nAnd the deep corruption of customs—\nNot something that can be changed in a day.\n\nNow, even if one tries to suppress it with laws,\nOr reinforces it with decrees,\nTheir deceitful hearts remain—\nOnly the Dao can transform them.\n\nLaws began with Fu Xi and were perfected by Yao,\nFully developed in the Zhou—\nYet cleverness reached its peak.\nThus it is known that when the Zhou declined,\nThe Dao faded.\n\nLaozi composed the *Classic*,\nIts intent here.\nYet it was not merely for his time—\nIt was meant as an oracle for all ages.\n\nWhen chaos arose, it was no different from the Warring States—\nThe excess of valuing the worthy, prizing wealth, and excessive desire.\n\n**Confucius said:**\n*\"The people can be made to follow, but not to understand.\"*\n\n**Emperor Yao heard a child’s song:**\n*\"Unknowing, unknowing,\nFollowing Heaven’s patterns.\"*\n\nIf those above are knowledgeable and desiring,\nYet wish the people to be without knowledge or desire—\nThis is impossible.\nIt is like hating drunkenness yet forcing wine—\nTruly, nothing is better than\nUsing utmost sincerity to transform them,\nPurity and simplicity to guard them.\nIf those above act as if foolish,\nThe people below remain unknowing—\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"The ruler like a tree branch,\nThe people like wild deer—\nWhat use is there for rewards and punishments?\"*\n\nForced effort and rigid conduct,\nSeparating from the world and customs—\nThe people begin to doubt.\n\n**Second Point: Restraining cleverness and artifice.**\nMake the knowledgeable dare not act.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"I will deceive them with simplicity—*\n*The people are hard to govern because their cleverness is excessive.\"*\n\n**Zhuangzi said:**\n*\"When the Dao prevails in the world, the Sage completes it;\nWhen the Dao does not prevail, the Sage arises.\"*\n\nExcessive knowledge and desire\nThrow the world into chaos—\nUntil the people lose their natural nature,\nAnd punishment is used to suppress them—\nThis is the root of greater disorder.\n\nThe Qin poisoned the world—\nTheir cleverness was supreme,\nYet they could not use benevolence and righteousness,\nOnly punishment and coercion,\nTo govern the world—\nTheir kindness did not reach the people,\nSo their downfall came swiftly.\n\nYet the people were not without knowledge—\nIt could be hidden and unused.\nOnly if those above do not provoke it,\nThen those below, though knowing, dare not act.\n\n*The Yinxu Classic* says:\n*\"Cut off the root of gain,\nAnd ten armies will be useless.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nIf those who know dare to act,\nThen even strict prohibitions are insufficient.\nTo this point, even if one wishes to punish them,\nThere are those punishment cannot reach.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves.\"*\n\n**Fourth: Displaying the function of *wuwei*.**\n\n1. *Transformation proceeds without display.*\n\n*Wuwei* yet action—\nThis sentence summarizes the entire meaning,\nTo show that the Sage, though governing through *wuwei*,\nIs never without action.\n\n*Wuwei* cuts off external interference,\nAction aligns with affairs—\nWhat is not the Dao becomes the Dao in practice.\n\nTo act without showing traces of action,\nTo govern without displaying governance—\nThis is the pinnacle.\n\nHow then does one act without showing traces,\nOr govern without displaying function?\n\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*\"Motionless yet responsive,\nStirred and thus in harmony.\"*\n\nThe unmoving is nature,\nThe responsive is emotion.\nNature is originally *wuwei*—\nThe essence of the Dao.\n\nThe Dao as nature\nIs formless in reality,\nYet at its extreme, it manifests—\nFrom Heaven and Earth to all things,\nNone arise without this.\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n*\"All things flourish,\nYet they all stem from *wuwei*—this is the Dao.\"*\n\nEmerging from the Sage’s heart,\nResponding to the divine in sequence—\nPenetrating Heaven, Heaven responds;\nPenetrating Earth, Earth responds—\nNothing but the movement of spirit.\n\nWhat is seen in the movement of spirit—\nThis is action.\nWhat moves yet shows no progress—\nThis is originally *wuwei*.\n\nMoreover, if one does not act,\nCould the world’s affairs be neglected for a day or two?\nNeglect leads to disorder.\nIf one governs each matter,\nInspects each thing—\nThen labor is endless.\n\nExhaustion leads to decline,\nDecline leads to disorder.\n\nNow, the Way of action—\nHow could it avoid\nRen with its benevolence,\nRighteousness with its fittingness,\nRitual with its form,\nTrust with its sincerity,\nGrace with its love,\nLaw with its authority?\n\nIf one governs without these,\nYet still seeks order—\nIt cannot be attained.\n\nIn the Age of the Yellow Emperor,\nGifts were exchanged without written laws,\nBut by the time of the Three Sovereigns,\nKnots on cords were already used.\nGenerally, in ancient times,\nThe people were pure and simple,\nAnd the efficacy of *wuwei* was easily seen.\n\nIf one claims that later ages\nMust only act and cannot practice *wuwei*,\nThen the Dao cannot be followed.\n\nOnly the Sage who embodies the Dao\nCan harmonize these truths.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Its Way is vast—\nNo thing is neglected.\"*\n\nTo neglect nothing is truly *wuwei*.\nYet when seeking the Dao,\nThe Dao itself is *wuwei*.\n\nThis is what is meant by\n*\"Doing without doing.\"*\n\nConsider this:\n*Wuwei* is the Sage within,\nAction is the Sovereign without.\nThe Sage within is profound in emptiness,\nThe Sovereign without creates deeds and enterprises.\n\nWith a heart of profound emptiness\nTo undertake affairs,\nThen actions arise from the Dao,\nThe Dao roots in emptiness—\n*Wuwei* and action blend without trace.\nWhat more is there to seek?\n\nThis treatise concludes\nBy not valuing the worthy,\nDesiring the Sage’s solitary transformation.\n\nSolitary transformation is divine.\nIf one does not personally embody the Dao,\nYet achieves *wuwei* naturally—\nThis is the governance of the Great Sage.\n\nIf one relies on worthy ministers,\nThat is retreat.\nNow, let us observe the Sage’s divine teaching:\n\nShaking the hearts of people,\nGuiding them toward virtue and custom—\nTheir simplicity grows gradually,\nTheir awakening comes softly.\nWithout action, all things transform;\nWithout *wuwei*, the people are settled—\nThis is divine.\n\nNow, observe the succession of Yao to Shun:\nShun appointed the Nine Ministers,\nAnd Gao Yao said:\n*\"Knowledge lies in knowing people,\nKnowing people makes one wise,\nAble to govern officials and settle the people—this is benevolence.\"*\n\nAgain he said:\n*\"All craftsmen follow their seasons,\nThe common people continue their labors.\"*\n\nThus, when the court was orderly,\nIt could lead all under Heaven.\n\nAs for *Zhonghu*’s praise of Tang,\n*\"He used people only as he himself would,\"*\nYet he still required worthy ministers as assistants.\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"Seek the talented and capable\nTo jointly achieve the governance of all under Heaven—\nThe wise plan for it,\nThe capable execute it,\nThe ruler rests while ministers labor.\"*\n\nThis, seen in practice,\nShows the ruler’s ability to entrust others,\nThus achieving *wuwei* governance.\n\nThe one who depends on nothing\nIs the Sage’s *wuwei*.\nThe one who depends on the worthy\nAchieves *wuwei* through them.\n\nGenerally, having worthy ministers brings order,\nLosing them brings ruin.\nNot valuing them is the way of the Great Sage.\n\nThe world often says\nThat Laozi’s teachings\nResemble the chaos of the primordial age,\nNot the Way of governance—\nHow then can it be called *wuwei*?\n\n*Wuwei* is not neglecting the Middle Way.\nThe Dao aligns with nature—\nThen nothing remains untended.\n\nThus, *wuwei* is seen in its efficacy.\nWhen it comes to *wuwei*,\nIt merges with the Dao.\n\n---\n*The Moral and Virtue Classic: Collected Meanings, Volume Seven*\nThe Lord, renowned for his uncorrupted virtue among the thousand lords,\n*\"Thousand\"* should be *\"at\"* according to the *Zuozhuan*.\n*The Moral and Virtue Classic: Collected Meanings, Volume Eight*\nMaster Yingyuan of Constant Virtue, Path of Mysterious Perfection, Xuanmiao Observatory.\n\n**The Moral and Virtue Classic: Collected Meanings**\n\n**On the Chapter \"Not Valuing the Worthy\"**\n\nSūshì Liú Wéiyǒng compiled, with annotations by the former Court Attendant and Treasury Bureau Clerk, former *Jùnmì Yuàn* Editor Dīng Yìdōng.\n\n**Shào Ruòyú** said:\n*\"Not valuing the worthy\"* makes the people not contend—thus achieving *wuwei*, and nothing remains untended.\n\nHe who does not value the worthy and able fears that men will boast of their wisdom.\nWhat the king favors becomes the *wind*; what the people delight in becomes the *custom*.\nWhen the ruler prizes the wise and clever, the common folk’s hearts turn to rivalry and striving.\n\n*\"Not valuing the worthy\"* prevents the people from contending over reputation—that is all.\n\nFood is but a commodity; its purpose is to sustain life—why then prize what is rare?\nIf rarity is prized, the people will surely hoard it.\nBy human nature, if given, they will not accept it; if hoarded, they will steal and plunder.\n\nIn governing, one does not refrain from using wealth—yet one does not prize rare and difficult-to-obtain goods, lest the people become thieves.\n\nWhen the common folk see no allure in fame or gain, their desires grow orderly, and the people govern themselves.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\n*\"Not valuing the worthy\"* makes the people ignorant—ignorance empties the mind, and an empty mind can embrace all things.\nHence, *\"fill their bellies.\"*\n*\"Not prizing wealth\"* makes the people desireless—desirelessness weakens the will, and a weak will does not bend to circumstance.\nHence, *\"strengthen their bones.\"*\n\nEver keep the people ignorant, so their minds remain empty;\nEver keep them desireless, so they forget the world.\nWhen mind and world are both forgotten, no attachments remain—all affairs cease.\nThus, even the wise dare not act.\nThe Sage acts with no intention—then nothing in the world remains untended.\n\n**Wáng Zhìrán** said:\n*\"Not valuing the worthy\"* makes the people not contend—thus nothing remains untended.\n\nTo speak of the Dao yet disregard its order is not the Dao.\nTo speak of the Dao yet misunderstand it—how can one claim to have found it?\n\nZhuangzi’s *\"Nine Transformations\"* and *\"Five Changes\"*—discarding or upholding *xíngmíng* (names and forms)—is like walking the Dao backward.\nThose who encounter the Dao and praise it—how can they govern others?\nThose who suddenly speak of *xíngmíng*—have they not yet grasped the fundamental intent of learning and governance?\n\nNames are the guests of reality.\nOnce names and reality are fixed in their internal and external distinctions, all under Heaven’s ranks follow their duties—why would the worthy be abandoned in the wild, unused?\n\nYet Laozi’s intent in saying *\"do not value them\"* holds profound meaning.\nThus Zhuangzi says: *\"To promote the worthy is to invite contention over titles.\"*\n\nValuing the worthy sparks contention—leading to chaos under Heaven, where cunning deceit, disputes over right and wrong, and the dissolution of morals arise.\nConfucians and Mohists all emerge—such is the danger of valuing the worthy.\n\nGathering all under Heaven’s wealth to nourish its people, yet the people are content, striking the earth and singing, drumming their bellies and wandering—each thing serves its purpose without being enslaved by things.\nHow could one secretly prize such a state?\n\nLaozi’s intent in saying *\"do not prize them\"* is also profound.\n\nAll things under Heaven flourish in their appointed roles—each has its place.\nWhen their time to flourish comes, so too comes their time to decay.\nWhen their time to be prized comes, so too comes their time to be despised.\nThis is their natural course—how can one’s heart interfere?\n\nThose who seek to prize them must obtain them at all costs.\nIf they cannot, they will risk life and limb to seize them—\nleading to robbery, covetousness, and every vice.\nIs theft the only sin?\n\nThis stems from the ruler’s preferences—when the ruler favors something, the people will pursue it excessively.\n\nThe *Classic* says: *\"Do not let the desirable be seen, lest the heart be disturbed.\"*\nConfucius said: *\"Wealth and honor are what people desire.\"*\nEven what is seen and heard—scented, tasted, or felt—stirs the emotions and disturbs the mind, all called *\"desirable.\"*\n\nIf desire is insatiable, even Heaven and Earth’s vastness and all things’ abundance cannot satisfy it.\n\nThe gentleman desires *name*; the commoner desires *gain*.\nIf all under Heaven—worthy or unworthy—see no desirable desires, their hearts remain still—what disturbance could there be?\n\nThus the Sage ever empties the mind, unfettered by any thing;\nEver fills the belly, unobstructed by any thing.\nWithin, observing the mind—vast and empty;\nWithout, observing the form—yielding with things like flowing water.\nFrom afar, observing things—things have no hold on him.\n\nThus, a weak will is useful; strong bones stand firm.\nWhere the will directs, there it guards.\nThe kidneys store the will, and bones are the kidneys’ remnant—\nWeakening the will steadies the essence, and the bones grow strong.\nThe heart stores the spirit, and the belly is the heart’s dwelling—\nEmptying the mind preserves the spirit, and the belly is filled.\n\nFrom this, all transformations arise in the body;\nSpirit and essence arise from the Dao—\nWith this, one governs humanity and harmonizes with Heaven.\n\nEver keep the people ignorant and desireless,\nSo even the wise dare not act.\nOnly thus does nothing remain untended.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"In harmony with ignorance, virtue does not depart;\nIn harmony with desirelessness, this is called *sūpǔ* (primordial simplicity).\"*\nPrimordial simplicity restores human nature.\n\nIf so, how could the world know whether the worthy should be valued or not,\nWhether wealth should be prized or not?\n\n**Huáng Màocái** said:\n*\"Not valuing the worthy\"* reaches the point where the heart is undisturbed.\nJust as one harmonizes one’s radiance, fearing others’ knowledge—\nWhy value the worthy? Thus, the people do not contend.\nThe non-contending each find contentment in their nature’s spontaneity.\n\nJust as one restrains desire, fearing things’ disturbances—\nWhy prize wealth? Thus, the people do not steal.\nThe non-stealing take sufficiency in themselves and have abundance.\n\n*\"Not seeing the desirable\"* is not closing one’s eyes to it.\nMany things pass before us, stirring the heart—\nOne may not know what can be obtained,\nBut if one sees only that nothing is truly desirable,\nThen nothing can disturb the heart.\n\n「What then? The beauty of Máoqiáng and Lìjì is renowned throughout the land—\nno one fails to covet it.\nYet fish seeing them dive deep, birds seeing them soar high,\nand deer seeing them flee swiftly—\nby this reasoning, indeed, if one truly sees nothing as desirable,\nthen the heart remains undisturbed.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance reaches the point of filling one’s belly.\nNánguō Zǐtài reclined behind his screen, gazing heavenward and sighing,\nlost in his own emptiness—\nto cultivate the heart to this extent is what may be called *emptiness* (虚).\n\nBeyond mere satiation, though rare delicacies and sumptuous flavors\nbe displayed before him,\nhe fears only that they may not be swiftly cleared away—\nthis is why his belly craves only the real.\n\nThe *Classic* states: *\"The Sage governs for the belly, not for the eyes.\"*\n\nWeaken one’s resolve.\nThose who strengthen themselves have resolve.\nNow, why weaken it?\nStrengthening oneself may advance one toward the Dao,\nbut weakening it may lead one to the state of daily diminishment.\n\nStrengthen one’s bones.\nThe Dao of Lǎozǐ runs deep in the principle of *strong strength* (强强).\nThus it is said: *\"The overbearing shall not meet their natural end.\"*\nNow, why strengthen one’s bones?\nIt is a warning against the strong—\nlest they contend with things.\nStrengthening one’s bones is self-strengthening.\nThe Dao stands firm and unchanging—\nhow could the weak govern it?\nAlways keep the people without knowledge and without desire.\n\nLǎozǐ likened governing the state and the people\nto cultivating oneself,\nsaying *\"to make the people\"* is to make oneself—\nwithout knowledge and without desire,\nnot like the dullness of wood or stone that lacks all desire.\nAt first, one cannot lack knowledge entirely—\nto remove knowledge until it is utterly gone;\nat first, one cannot lack desire entirely—\nto remove desire until it is utterly gone.\nThen, who but a Daoist gentleman,\nwith his accumulated virtue,\ncould achieve this?\n\nIf the wise are allowed to appear,\nthen nothing shall remain ungoverned.\nThe Dao is natural—\nhow could it be shaped by intelligence?\nOnly by acting without action in non-action\nmay it be attained.\n\nChéng Tài’s words on governance say:\n*\"Not valuing the worthy brings the people to non-contention,\nuntil the heart is undisturbed.\"*\nIf such a person is worthy,\nyet he hides his excellence and does not display it,\nflashing his brilliance before the world,\nthen surely there will be those who shame themselves\nfor not being equal to him\nand who strive to contend with him.\nThus Zhuāngzǐ said: *\"To elevate the worthy is to invite the people to jostle.\"*\n\nTo prize hard-to-obtain wealth\nis to invite those who abandon their livelihoods\nto chase profit,\nand who do not hesitate to become thieves.\nThus it is said: *\"Wealth accumulates, then contention arises.\"*\nContention and theft all stem from seeing what is desirable\nand thus stirring the heart.\nIf the ruler conceals his likes and dislikes,\nand does not reveal them,\nthen the people below have no direction for profit,\nand all that is desirable no longer appears before them.\nThe heart remains undisturbed,\nand contention and theft naturally cease.\nThis is the Dao of Lǎozǐ—\nrectifying the root and clarifying the source.\n\nJiāng Yǔ’s exhortation on governance says:\n*\"Necessarily elevate those of public loyalty,\nand let there be nothing private,\nthen who among the people would dare not to be orderly?\"*\nJiāng Yǔ’s words,\nthough common among those who seek governance since Yáo and Shùn,\nwere criticized by Jìzhé, who said:\n*\"If you speak thus, it is only your own way of acting.\"*\nThe dangers of the high platform are many,\nand those who would cast their lot there are numerous—\na criticism of displaying excellence openly,\nas clear as the platform’s invitation to all,\nso that they see what is desirable and flock to it,\nand contention grows.\n\nYet, if the worthy are seen but not valued,\nis this not a distinction?\nIt is only to obliterate traces\nand thus extinguish contention.\nAll that Lǎozǐ’s teaching seeks to conceal and use subtly\nholds this same intent.\n*See* (见) is read as *manifest* (现)—\nwhen the ruler steps forth and reveals himself.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance reaches the point of strengthening one’s bones.\nThe mind is always present in thought,\nand resolve is present when action is desired.\nThe belly is for nourishment,\nand the bones are for bearing burdens.\nLǎozǐ’s text contains metaphor and direct speech—\nhere, the belly and bones\nare indeed their true names.\n\nIn a later passage, it is said:\n*\"The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\"*\nThis is the case where one should fill what is real\nand dispel what is false.\n\nAgain it is said:\n*\"The people are difficult to govern because their cleverness is excessive.\"*\nThis is the warning against the strong\nand the search for means to weaken them.\n\nGēngsāng’s dwelling feared collapse—\nhis clever ministers left him,\nhis compassionate concubines withdrew—\nnot allowing his heart to harbor cleverness or compassion,\nthis is the pursuit of emptiness.\n\nTo dwell with those who are bloated\nand to appoint those who are clumsy—\nbloated and clumsy are not those whose bones are strong\nand can endure burdens,\nyet they are not counted among the few.\nThis is why he established Gēngsāng’s principles,\nmocking Yáo and Shùn’s elevation of the worthy\nand appointment of the clever.\n\nAlways keep the people without knowledge and without desire.\nIf the people have knowledge, then their cleverness is excessive,\nand this is why they are difficult to govern.\nIf they have desire, then they see what is desirable,\nand this is why contention and theft arise.\nLǎozǐ values *non-action* (无为),\nwishing to place the world in a state of *non-affairs* (无事),\nand to make the world also content with *non-affairs*.\nZhuāngzǐ’s words on governance effects say:\n*\"To align with the lack of knowledge—\nits virtue does not depart.\nTo align with the lack of desire—\nthis is called *primordial simplicity* (素朴).\"*\nIn primordial simplicity, the nature of the world is attained.\n\nIf the wise are not allowed to act,\nthen they do not dare to act.\nTo make the people without knowledge and without desire\nis to make them dull.\nYet among them are those who are obstinate and clever,\nunreceptive to dullness—\nthese are the ones called *clever*.\nThe clever cannot be made dull again.\n\nThus, if all under heaven follow my teaching,\nthen they shall all be without knowledge and without desire.\nWithout knowledge and without desire,\nthey shall love their native soil and find joy in their work,\nand cannot be lured into chaos.\nEven if there are the clever,\nknowing they have no one to join them,\nthey shall lose resolve and no longer dare to act.\nHence it is said:\n*\"Make the people value death over migration,\nthen even with armies and weapons,\nthere shall be no place to deploy them.\"*\nThe Sage who claims he can again bind the people with knots\nachieves this through these very means.\n\nZhuāngzǐ took this language and entrusted it to antiquity,\nsaying:\n*\"The ancient people dwelled in the *chaotic undifferentiation* (混茫),\nand with the world attained *tranquility* (澹漠).\"*»\n\nAt this very time, all things remain unharmed, all living beings do not perish young, and though people may have wisdom, they have no use for it—this is the very proof of it. To act through *non-action* (*wuwei*) is to ensure nothing remains untended.\n\nThough it is said to act through *non-action*, this does not mean abandoning deeds entirely. Rather, to dwell in *non-action* and govern through *non-interference*, this is what is meant by *wuwei*. I govern through *non-action*, and the people respond with their own *wuwei*—this is what is called *\"govern through non-action, and the people transform themselves; govern through non-interference, and the people prosper on their own.\"* How then could there be any failure to achieve order?\n\nZhān Qiúbù said: *\"If one does not exalt the virtuous, the people will not contend for them, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\"* The chapter *\"Nurturing the People\"* speaks of not desiring to honor the virtuous, so that the people do not grow reckless and contend for fame. Not valuing rare treasures and strange jewels, so that the people do not turn to theft. Not displaying alluring luxuries and dazzling beauties, so that the heart does not generate chaotic desires. Thus, the Sage who governs the people, wishing to dwell in harmony with them for long, must first empty his own heart and abandon his cravings, always keeping the people in a state of *wu zhi wu yu* [without knowledge, without desire]. Even if they are wise, they dare not act. Thus, through *non-action*, governance becomes effortless and stable.\n\nZhang Chong replied: *\"If one does not exalt the virtuous, the people will not contend for them, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\"* Laozi emerged from the ancient past, when customs were pure and people were simple. They lived daily in *wuwei*, forgetting fame and gain, abstaining from music and color, their five spirits unperturbed. From the ancient times onward, the people changed from *Huang* [Yellow Emperor], to *Shi* [Emperor], to *Di* [Emperor], to *Wang* [King], with officials named after birds, then dragons, then kings, nobles, ministers, and great officers—all adorned with grand titles. Thus, empty names flourished, and the world came to revere those who wielded power through cleverness. Hence, Bi Gan contended and died, while Yi and Qi could not contend and so withdrew. The suffering of endless wars and strife arose, and yet they dug mountains and plundered the sea, mined gold and sifted sand, seeking fine jade and precious stones—never satisfied. Strange treasures and marvelous jewels only deepened their delusion. The world treasured rare and difficult-to-obtain goods, so Yu’s clan perished for hoarding jade, and Shi’s family was ruined for hiding treasure—thus bringing ruin to themselves and their virtue.\n\nAgain, the licentious sounds of pipes and bells assailed the ears, the wanton allure of women dazzled the eyes, strange flavors offended the palate, strange scents assailed the nose, and strange garments offended the body—clouding the mind and scattering the spirit—while alluring forms were laid bare. Thus, Shang fell to its debauchery of nightlong drinking, and Chen was destroyed by its decadence in the rear chambers, giving rise to regicide, rebellion, and chaos—all from these three evils.\n\nThus, the Sages of antiquity governed the people with no other means: they did not exalt those who wielded power through cleverness, did not treasure rare and difficult-to-obtain goods, nor indulged the allurements of desire. When the ruler acted thus, the people followed suit, and there was nothing to stir the hearts of contention, theft, or rebellion.\n\nThus, when the heart is emptied and no action is taken, the three evils [contention, theft, rebellion] are restrained. When the belly is filled and the Dao is cultivated without action, the three evils are exhausted. When the will is weakened—neither exalting, nor treasuring, nor desiring—while the bones are strengthened to remain ever healthy, strong, and at peace, if people observe my *non-action*, they will naturally be without knowledge and without desire.\n\nShould any wise person wish to exalt the virtuous, to treasure rare goods, or to indulge the five senses—eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and body—even they dare not act. Thus, all people act as if in *non-action*, and there is none who remains ungoverned.\n\nZhang Lingying said: If the heart is not emptied and clarified, how can the *qi* be harmonized and the organs filled? If the will is not humble and weak, how can the essence be solidified to strengthen the sinews and bones? When the heart is always empty, the *qi* is not depleted; when the will is always weak, the essence is not wasted. Then the belly is full, the bones are strong—what more could ail one with fears of *trendency* (*quju*) or *nocturnal emissions* (*mengyi*)?\n\nGenerally, when a man suffers from *trendency*, it arises from *qi* that is not harmonized; when he loses semen in dreams, it comes from essence that is not solidified. Both stem from *qi* not harmonized—because the heart is not emptied—and essence not solidified—because the will is not weakened.\n\nBái Yùqiān said: *\"Not exalting the virtuous\"* means that as a son, one must be filial; as a subject, one must be loyal—thus the people do not contend, and when full, they do not crave more food. *\"Not treasuring rare goods\"* means gold is valued no more than soil—thus the people do not steal, for there is nothing to desire. *\"Not displaying alluring luxuries\"* means the heart remains steadfast between the ears—thus the heart does not stray; when it does, it is called back. Therefore, the Sage’s governance lies in emptying the heart, filling the belly, weakening the will, and strengthening the bones—always keeping the people without knowledge and without desire. Even the wise dare not act. Thus, through *non-action*, nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nLào Cùirán said: *\"Not exalting the virtuous\"* means the Daoist scholar does not seek honor and wealth.\n\n*\"Make the people not contend\"* means they remain silent and simple like the foolish, attaining the *Three Mysteries of Non-Contention*.*\n\n*\"Not treasuring rare goods\"* means viewing worldly riches as mere dust, neither greedy nor desiring—treasuring the *Inner Elixir* as the supreme treasure, cherishing oneself without arrogance—thus the people do not steal.\n\n*\"Knowing this, yet not desiring what is not desired\"* means the external self does not cling to things, while the internal self remains unseen, keeping the heart unmoved, like the *Great Void*—as still as the immovable.\n\nTherefore, the Sage’s governance: the ruler governs the land with the Dao, and I cultivate my body with this principle.\n\n*Empty the heart*—let emptiness be the body, let non-action be the heart.\n\n*Fill the belly*—let the divine *qi* surge vigorously, guarding purity within, refining the *Kàn* position at the center, and alchemizing the *Lí* Palace’s inner yin.\n\n*Weaken the will*—concentrate the *qi* to its utmost softness, motionless and tranquil, yet fierce in battle, victorious—then suddenly strike like thunder, erupting as the earth’s lightning.\n\n*Strengthen the bones*—hide the form within the body, conceal the spirit within the heart; draw water and fire to nourish the elixir daily, so that *golden sinews* and *jade bones* grow naturally firm.\n\nAlways let the people be without knowledge and without desire—then the land is secure, the people prosper, and there is no other way. My descendants will also face no troubles.\n\nEven the wise, *when they understand this truth*, dare not act.\n\nThus, through *non-action*, all is governed.\n\nHow could *non-action* ever be mistaken for mere *inaction*? The Dao ever flows naturally—then nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nIf you grasp the One, all things are complete.\nThen how could it not be joyous?\n\nChen Bi Xu said:\n*\"Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend.*\nFor when the ruler is humble, yielding, and tranquil—\nnot boasting of his own virtue and ability—\nthe people follow his transformation like wind sweeping grass,\nguarding with gentleness and submission—\nwhat room is there for contention?\n\nThe Classic says:\n*'I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love tranquility, yet the people align themselves.'*\n\nIt is further explained:\n*'When the ruler is tranquil, ministers are clear;\npunishments do not spare the noble, blessings do not exclude the lowly;\nthe worthy and unworthy each fulfill their roles—\nthen the scholars will not contend.*\n\nBut if the ruler is indecisive, ministers flatter and deceive,\neven if he exalts the worthy and seeks talent,\nthose with outward loyalty but inward deceit—\npoisonous in intent yet harmonious in speech—\nwill arrive, and then deceit and strife will arise.\n\nYan Jun Ping said:\n*'The virtuous rule as sovereigns, the lesser serve as ministers.\nThe worthy are not one in ten thousand, sages do not appear in every age.\nThe worthy are not produced by exaltation—\nthis is natural, not contrived.'*\n\nHe further said:\n*'As if driving a poor horse and a fine steed together on a level road,\nor letting a wild goose and a partridge fly side by side in the blue sky—\nthen the worthy and unworthy become apparent.*\n\nThis is natural, not the result of exaltation.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend;\ndo not prize hard-to-obtain goods, and the people will not steal.*\nHard-to-obtain goods are gold, jade, pearls, and rhinoceros horn.\nWhen the ruler’s transformation is pure and tranquil,\nthe people attend to farming and weaving,\nburying gold in the mountains and casting pearls into the depths,\nfinding no profit in wealth or attraction in riches—\nthen the people’s hearts will harbor no greed or theft.\n\nIt is further explained:\n*\"The black dragon’s night-light pearl,\ngold, jade, brocade, and embroidered adornments—\nif the ruler does not prize them,\nthe subjects will not covet them,\nthen where would thieves and robbers arise?\nThe saying goes:\n*'If a man does not desire it, even if rewarded, he will not steal.'*\n\n*The Hong Lie Jie* cites the laws of Shennong:\n*'If men of strength do not till the fields, there will be those who starve in the world;\nif women of childbearing age do not weave, there will be those who freeze in the world.\nThus, let the ruler himself plow and his wife weave,\nsetting an example for the world.*\n\nIn guiding the people, he does not prize hard-to-obtain goods,\nnor does he display desirable things to keep their hearts undisturbed.\nDesirable things are those external objects or passions\nthat stir the heart to admiration or lust.\nYet *not seeing* does not mean banishing them from sight—\nit means not letting them be seen as desirable,\nbut rather embracing *non-action* toward them.\n\nIf the ruler, seeing external things, harbors no admiration or lust,\nthen he is untouched by the defilements of form,\nand his original purity—tranquil, serene, and restored to its true unity—\nremains unshaken.\n\nWhen the ruler guards this true unity,\nthe people’s hearts will not be disturbed,\nand the wind of simplicity and sincerity will prevail.\n\nYan Jun Ping said:\n*'If the age does not exalt the worthy, the people will not vie;\nif they do not vie, they will not contend;\nif they do not contend, there will be no disorder.\nIf the age does not prize wealth, the people will not desire;\nif they do not desire, they will not seek;\nif they do not seek, they will not steal.\nIf the age abandons the five flavors, the people will have no joy;\nif they have no joy, they will have no pleasure;\nif they have no pleasure, they will not indulge in licentiousness.\nThis is the natural order.'*\n\n*The Hong Lie Jie* says:\n*'When Zi Pei requested permission to drink with King Zhuang of Chu,\nthe king granted it. Zi Pei bowed and stood facing north in the hall,\nsaying: \"Earlier, the king granted my request,\nyet now you do not fulfill it—\nhave I committed some offense?\"\n\nThe king replied: \"I heard you were enjoying yourself at Jiang Tai.\nJiang Tai overlooks the mountains to the south,\ncommanding the vast lands, with the Yangtze to the left and the Huai to the right—\nits pleasures make one forget death.\nA man of my meager virtue cannot bear such joys.\nI fear that if I stay, I will not return.\"\nThus it is said: *\"Do not display desirable things, lest the heart be disturbed.\"*\n\nFu Yi’s *Yin Yi* says:\n*\"The ancient text reads: 'Make the people’s hearts undisturbed.'\nThe River Shore Master and Kai Yuan Imperial editions read: 'Make the heart undisturbed,' which is also acceptable.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance begins with emptying the heart.\nThe governance of the Great Sage first refines the self,\nthen extends to family and state.\n\nTo empty the heart is to banish all deceitful thoughts,\nnot to let the mind chase after external things,\nbut to remain inwardly still—\nwhere desires vanish, the spirit settles naturally,\nand the heart becomes empty.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"In an empty chamber, purity arises;\nauspicious omens linger.\"*\n\nThis means that when the heart is empty, pristine whiteness emerges,\nand blessings take root.\n\nTo fill the belly:\nThe Sage’s virtue and power are internally abundant,\nthe five spirits tranquil,\ncontentment effortless and self-sufficient,\nwith no room for greed or love—\nthus it is said: *\"Fill the belly.\"*\n\nTo weaken the will:\nThe will is the mind’s affair—\nwhen the mind acts, it is called will.\nTo ensure that every thought and deed\nadheres to humility, tranquility, gentleness, and weakness—\nthen the Dao is preserved.\n\nTo strengthen the bones:\nThe bones are the body’s framework.\nWhen harmony and sufficiency are complete,\nthe body is nourished, and the spirit robust—\nthen the bones naturally grow strong.\n\nAlways let the people be without knowledge and without desire:\nThe Sage’s constant cultivation of the self and emptying of the heart\nis to restore the people to simplicity and sincerity,\nso they transform joyfully of their own accord.\n\nThe saying goes:\n*\"If one first rectifies himself,\nwhat difficulty is there in governance?\"*\n\nThough the learned may possess knowledge of exaltation\nor feign deceitful appearances,\nonce they are touched by the wind of tranquility and simplicity,\ntheir hearts grow dull, their bodies wither—\nthey dare not stir their restless, desiring minds.\n\nTo act with *non-action* is to govern without fail.\nTo act with *non-action* is to walk the Dao of *non-action*.\n*Non-action* means not overstepping one’s nature.\nWhen nature is not overstepped, the natural order is complete—\nand when complete, all actions are *non-action*.\n\nIf all things act with *non-action*,\nthen the hearts of exaltation, prizing, and greed\nare naturally extinguished,\nand the great wind of simplicity prevails—\nwho would say governance fails?\"\n\n「When Xie Tunan said: *\"If one does not exalt the worthy, the hearts of the people will not be disturbed.\"*\n\nFor a ruler to employ the worthy and utilize their abilities is a natural duty, but he must not establish the name of exaltation. Once the name of exaltation is set, then the petty will seize upon it to claim the title for themselves. If one prizes and honors things of rare value that bring no benefit, then those who covet what is difficult to obtain will inevitably think of stealing and taking by force. If one exposes the senses to what is merely desirable yet unprofitable, it will stir the heart and lead to those who seek to disrupt what is done.\n\nThe ruler’s intentions must be cautious indeed. Therefore, the sage acts with utmost sincerity—\nto empty the heart is to prevent desires from entering within,\nto fill the belly is to ensure that the Dao’s nourishment does not fail within,\nto weaken the will is to let intentions not stray into arrogance or submission,\nto strengthen the bones is to cultivate vigor without weariness in labor.\nThus does the sage govern—\never making the people reach the state of *non-treatment*.\n\nDesires arise from knowledge;\nwithout knowledge, there are no desires.\nIf the ruler transforms with *non-knowledge* and *non-desire*,\nthen the people respond with *non-knowledge* and *non-desire*.\nEven if he cannot make them utterly free of knowledge,\nthose among them who boast of cleverness and display ability\nwill still be subtly diminished and transformed,\nuntil they retreat to the point where they dare not act.\nThis so-called \"knowledge\" is but the private scheming of blood and *qi*—\nnot the true *virtue* of the heart.\n\nIf they dare to act, it will surely harm governance.\nTherefore, when the ruler governs with *non-action*,\nthere is nothing the people cannot be brought to *non-treatment*.\n\nIndeed, the people follow not the ruler’s commands,\nbut his inclinations.\nIf his intentions are not cautious,\nthen his words and deeds will inevitably invite excess.\nThe sages of old sincerely cultivated their intentions to rectify their hearts,\nrectified their hearts to cultivate their persons,\ncultivated their persons to govern the state and pacify the world—\ntheir spirit and thought concentrated in one hall,\nwhile their moral influence spread far and wide across the ten thousand *li*,\nresponding to the slightest movement without delay.\nLater rulers, however, exhausted their emotions and indulged their desires,\ndoing whatever they pleased,\nand yet blamed the world for its difficulty to transform,\nand the people for their stubbornness.\nAlas, how confused they were!\n\nLin Yongqing said: *\"If one does not exalt the worthy, the people will not vie—\nthen there will be nothing that is not governed.\"*\n\n*Exaltation* means *boasting*.\nIf I boast of the worthy, then I will surely arouse contention throughout the world.\nYu alone did not boast, and thus none could vie with him in ability.\nThis is the meaning.\n\nIf I prize rare treasures,\nthen all will have desires to obtain them,\nand the consequence will be theft.\nThese two lines reveal the intent of what follows:\n*\"If one does not see what is desirable, then the heart naturally settles.\nNot seeing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.\"*\nThese eight characters are most excellent.\n\nTo empty the heart is to have no thoughts of admiration.\nTo fill the belly is to satisfy hunger for food.\nTo weaken the will is to avoid striving for competition.\nTo strengthen the bones is to nourish one’s vitality.\nIt speaks of the sages of antiquity,\nwho merely ensured the people were well-fed,\nwith no other thoughts of admiration,\nand whose strength was robust yet unspent in competition—\nthus their people were pure and simple,\nwithout knowledge or desire,\nthough cleverness might occasionally stir within them,\ntheir knowledge, though sprouting in the heart,\nwould not dare to manifest in action.\n\nThe sage’s governance of the world was thus,\nand yet the sage himself had no place in the world for his heart.\nIn his governance, he acted entirely with *non-action*,\nand thus there was nothing that was not governed.\n*\"Not seeing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.\"*\nThis describes how the sage taught his people.\n\n*To employ* means to guide the people.\nNot exalting the worthy,\nnot honoring rare treasures—\nall these stem from fear of stirring desires.\nStirring desires is not limited to these two matters;\nthey are merely stated as examples.\n\nLaozi lamented the confusion of the later ages,\nand thus pondered the simplicity of antiquity.\nHis words, however, were somewhat excessive,\nand thus did not fully capture the sage’s Way.\n\nFan Yingyuan said: *\"Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from vying.*\n*Exaltation* means *preference*.\nThe worthy are those with *ability*.\nAgain, according to the *Shuo Wen* [\"Explanations of Texts\"], they are those with *many talents*.\n*Vying* means *competition*—\nif one favors those with slight talents and abilities,\nthen the people will compete to cultivate these talents and abilities,\nand not seek the natural Way.\n\nMoreover, slight talents and abilities can be used by others,\nbut those with slight talents and abilities cannot be relied upon to use others.\nTo strive for talent while neglecting *virtue* is not the conduct of a gentleman.\nIf the ruler does not favor those with slight talents and abilities,\nthen the people will not vie.\n\nNot honoring rare treasures prevents the people from becoming thieves.\nRare treasures refer to gold and jade—\nif one honors them, then the people will love the objects\nand suffer from their lack,\nleading them to theft.\n\nTherefore, the sage’s governance reaches its peak in strengthening the bones.\n*Governance* means *order*—\nordering oneself to order the world.\nIf the ruler has no exaltation,\nthen the people will not indulge in vain imaginings—\ndesires are removed,\nis this not also emptying the heart?\n\nIf the ruler cherishes *Dao* and *virtue*,\nthen the people will embrace simplicity—\nthe natural order is preserved.\nIs this not also filling the belly?\n\nIf the ruler maintains gentleness and harmony,\nthen the people will be transformed,\nand their *qi* will not be violent—\nis this not also weakening the will?\n\nIf the ruler has no fondness for desires,\nthen the people will be transformed,\nand their bodies will naturally be robust and healthy—\nis this not also strengthening the bones?\n\nIf one can achieve this,\nthen one can make the people without knowledge or desire.\nThese four lines have those who interpret them solely in terms of personal cultivation,\nyet the text before and after clearly conveys the idea of rectifying oneself and transforming the people.\n\nEver making the people without knowledge—\nthen they dare not act.\nFor the people, when they know of exaltation,\nwhen they see what is desirable,\nthey will vie and steal,\nand bring chaos.\nTherefore, one must always guide them to have no false knowledge or false desires,\nand prevent clever and cunning men from acting presumptuously.\n\nTo govern with *non-action* is to have nothing that is not governed.\nThe sage has no words of exaltation,\nyet the people do not see what is desirable—\nfollowing the natural order in responding to things,\nthere is always a proper path to take,\nand thus it is *non-action* that prevails.»\n\nFor the Way to emerge from *non-action*,\nthen all undertakings are accomplished,\nall things fall into harmony,\nand thus nothing remains undone.\n\nXue Yongzai said:\n*\"To not exalt the worthy makes the people not contend—*\n*then their hearts are not disordered.*\n*To not exalt the worldly worthy,*\n*then the people will not contend.*\n*To not prize rare and difficult-to-obtain goods,*\n*then the people will not steal.*\n*To not display what is desirable,*\n*then the hearts of the people will not be disordered.*\nThus, the sage’s governance is to fortify their resolve—\n*to govern the state is like governing oneself.*\n\n*Empty their hearts,*\n*then their virtue has ample capacity.*\n*Fill their bellies,*\n*then they will not covet lands.*\n*Weaken their wills,*\n*then the Way of governance remains gentle.*\n*Strengthen their bones,*\n*then their limbs will not grow slack.*\n\n*Always make the people without knowledge and without desire—*\n*then nothing will remain ungoverned.*\n*In accord with ignorance,*\n*their virtue does not stray.*\n*In accord with desirelessness,*\n*this is called natural simplicity.*\n\nIf one can make the people thus,\neven the wise will not dare to act presumptuously.\n\n*Without desire, the world is sufficient.*\n*Without action, all things transform.*\n*Depth and stillness bring the people peace—*\nis this not the governance of *non-action*?\n\nXiu Xiu An said:\n*\"To not exalt the worthy makes the people not contend—*\n*then nothing will remain ungoverned.*\n\nThose who embrace the Way and practice the teaching of *non-speech*,\n*are internally empty and externally compliant,*\n*without likes or dislikes,*\n*thus they do not exalt the worthy,*\n*nor prize rare and difficult-to-obtain goods.*\n\nIf one has likes or exalts,\n*it is due to emotions and perceptions,*\n*and one cannot avoid*\n*giving rise to ability,*\n*to greedy pursuit,*\n*or to contention for merit,*\n*or to theft.*\n\nFor those advancing the Way and nurturing virtue,\n*they must first let no thought arise,*\n*reach the state of utmost emptiness,*\n*refined subtlety and mysterious penetration,*\n*and then attain self-cultivation.*\n\n*Is not the spirit of clarity precious?*\nIf there are thoughts of love or desire,\n*then emotions will be stirred,*\n*and the true heart will be confused.*\n\nThus, the sage cultivates oneself, harmonizes the family,\ngoverns the state, and brings peace to the world—\n*emptying their heart,*\n*without self, their measure is vast,*\n*their governance is *non-action*, yet all things transform naturally.*\n\n*To hold the Way in one’s bosom,*\n*is to fill their belly.*\n*To expand the virtue of non-contentiousness,*\n*is to weaken their will.*\n*To vigorously practice this Way,*\n*is to strengthen their bones.*\n\nIf one can do this,\n*they extinguish perception and have no knowledge,*\n*and emotions are annihilated.*\n\nZhu Boqiu said:\n*\"To not exalt the worthy makes the people not contend—*\n*then nothing will remain ungoverned.*\n\nThe ancients treasured innate worthiness,\nseeing the worthy and striving to emulate them.\nBut here it says ‘not exalt’—what does this mean?\n*For those of this age,*\n*many exalt their own worthiness,*\n*thus stirring contention,*\n*and jealousy arises from disorder.*\n*Only by not exalting one’s own worthiness*\n*can one recognize the true worthy of the world.*\n\nIt does not mean to abandon the worthy in the wild,\n*nor to not employ them.*\n*In times of moral decay,*\n*so-called worthy ones are not necessarily true,*\n*and those who are exalted are not necessarily sincere.*\n*The ruler feigns seeking worthy men,*\n*the scholars bear the ambition of their own worthiness,*\n*with deceit meeting deceit,*\n*all sink into vice,*\n*and worthiness becomes an empty title—*\n*how can it benefit the family and state?*\n\nTo teach ‘not to exalt one’s own worthiness’\n*is to clarify the source and open the path*\n*for the four seas’ worthy to come.*\n\n*Goods circulate in the world,*\n*abundant or scarce,*\n*to provide for the people’s use.*\n*Here, ‘not to prize’ refers*\n*specifically to rare and costly treasures—*\n*inch-long pearls, foot-wide jade,*\n*southern gold, great cowries,*\n*beautiful sounds and beasts,*\n*and objects of indulgence,*\n*which bring no benefit to the family and state,*\n*no relief to hunger and cold.*\n*If the ruler takes them,*\n*the people below will follow,*\n*leading to violence and theft,*\n*and the world’s hearts will be stirred by greed,*\n*with theft spreading between ruler and people.*\n\nBut as for flowing circulation,\n*like water and grain,*\n*silk, hemp, rice, and cloth—*\n*the people rely on these for life and sustenance.*\n*They are never neglected,*\n*thus it is said:*\n*‘Not to prize rare goods,*\n*but to value useful ones,*\n*to appropriately employ and utilize,*\n*ensuring abundance in homes—*\n*then where is the theft to come from?’*\n\nIn later ages, greed and extravagance ruined standards,\n*while lustful desires eroded the heart.*\n*The world was in chaos,*\n*all alike in one pattern.*\n*Only those who study and know the Way*\n*have clear boundaries,*\n*and will not overstep them.*\n*If one seeks indulgence and loses resolve,*\n*then food is taken merely to fill hunger,*\n*clothing is worn only for warmth,*\n*homes shelter against wind,*\n*and the two blessings of joy and fortune*\n*are measured by abundance or scarcity.*\n*What they enjoy is limited,*\n*what they seek is easily satisfied,*\n*their hearts harbor no covetousness—*\n*what can stir disorder in them?*\n\n*The ruler does not exalt the worthy,*\n*then the people below do not contend for renown.*\n*The ruler does not prize goods,*\n*then the people below do not contend for profit.*\n*The ruler does not display what is desirable,*\n*then the hearts of the people are not disordered.*\n\nAll this stems from *emptying the heart,*\n*so it does not receive external things,*\n*and thus what is desirable finds no entry.*\n\n*Empty the heart,*\n*then the original spirit dwells.*\n*Fill the belly,*\n*then the original qi gathers.*\n\n*To strengthen their resolve while weakening their will,*\n*is the means to invite harmony.*\n*To strengthen their bones while letting them bear labor,*\n*is the means to stand firm.*\n\n*Empty the heart and weaken the will,*\n*to make the people without knowledge.*\n*Fill the belly and strengthen the bones,*\n*to make the people without desire.*\n\nThen even if there are those with knowledge,\n*they will not dare to intrude*\n*with their own actions*\n*upon the ruler’s *non-action*.*\n\n*If the ruler can uphold the Way of *non-action*,*\n*practice what they have no need to do,*\n*then all undertakings in the world*\n*are without fail.*\n\n*The final sentence in the ancient text reads:*\n*‘nothing remains undone.’*\n*Its meaning extends beyond mere governance.*\n*Niu Miaozhuan said:*\n\n*\"To not exalt the worthy,*\n*to make the people not contend.*\n*The worthy are bright, sensitive, and wise—*\n*their talents and abilities.*\n*‘Not to exalt’ means*\n*not to boast of oneself,*\n*a humble phrase.*\n*If one is humble,*\n*then they shine.*\n*Why would the people contend?*\n\nThus, the gentleman does not magnify their own deeds,\nnor exalt their own merits,\n*yielding to the worthy,*\n*lowering themselves to honor others.*\n*If one lowers themselves,*\n*then the people will respect and honor them.*\n\nThe earlier scholars said:\n*\"I am worthy and capable—*\n*what worthiness or capability do I have beyond myself?*\n*I am exalted—*\n*what exaltation do I have beyond myself?*\n*I am honored above others—*\n*yet why should I honor myself?*\n*If I boast of this,*\n*then I am not worthy.*\n*If I am not worthy,*\n*then people will reject me—*\n*is this not contention?\"*\n\nThis is the saying of *\"to not exalt the worthy, making the people not contend.\"*\n\n*\"To not prize rare and difficult-to-obtain goods,*\n*to make the people not steal.*\n*Like the night-light pearl,*\n*or the moonlit jade—*\n*these are indeed rare and difficult-to-obtain goods.\"*\n\nThe **Master Mencius** said: *\"If one does not covet, even if rewarded, they will not steal—how then could there be thieves in the world?\"* Thus, the **Rujia** treasure not gold and jade but take **loyalty and trustworthiness** as their treasure.\n\nIn ancient times, a **Song man** presented a jade to **Zi Han**, who said: *\"I take ‘not being greedy’ as my treasure, while you take jade as yours. If we exchange, both of us lose our treasures.\"* He declined and did not accept it. This is truly the saying of *\"not prizing rare and difficult-to-obtain goods.\"*\n\n**Zhuangzi** said: *\"Abandon the sage’s wisdom, and great thieves will cease their craft. Shatter jade and destroy pearls, and petty thieves will not rise.\"* Is this not the meaning of *\"making the people not steal\"*?\n\n*Not seeing what is desirable* prevents the heart from being disordered.\nThe heart is the sovereign of the body, and desire is where the mind wanders.\nGenerally, when the eyes see something, the heart must ponder it;\nwhen the heart ponders, the mind must act;\nwhen the mind acts, that is called desire.\nWhen desire obscures the heart, clarity is lost—how could it not be disordered?\n\nThe *Record of Music* states:\n*\"Man is born tranquil—this is Heaven’s nature.\nWhen stirred by things, he moves—this is the nature of desire.\"*\nThus, those who practice greatly must always be cautious in their outward gaze,\nso as not to see desirable things,\nthen naturally the body and mind will be serene,\nfree from vexation and untroubled.\nThis is called *\"not seeing what is desirable.\"*\n\n**Mencius** also said: *\"Nothing nourishes the heart better than few desires.\"*\nThis is the same meaning.\n\nTherefore, the **Sage’s governance** lies in keeping the heart empty.\nThe Sage is one of profound virtue, wisdom, and clarity.\nBecause they follow Heaven and embody the **Dao/Way**, they always keep their heart empty.\nWhat is meant by *\"empty heart\"* is to discard the false.\nFor there is no principle outside the heart,\nyet the Sage possesses a heart that exhausts principle.\nAll principles under Heaven are what the heart contains.\nOnly by keeping it empty can they be nurtured,\nso that no private intention obstructs them,\nthen the mysteries of Heaven and Earth can all be discerned.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"When the body is empty, all things come.\nWhen the heart is without, harmonious qi returns.\"*\nThis is the meaning of the Sage’s cultivation—\nemptying the heart and governing the body.\n\n**Filling the abdomen.**\nBy *\"filling the abdomen,\"* it is not meant to gorge on rich foods\nand stuff the five viscera,\nbut to accumulate essence and gather qi to form the **True Self**.\nThus, the Sage always honors their **qi**, values their form,\ntreasures their life, and cherishes their spirit,\nso that the **True Self’s realm** is long preserved,\nvital energy is refined,\nthe nine orifices are unobstructed,\nand the body attains **born-again spirit**—\nthis is the Sage’s governance.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"My life is in myself, not given by Heaven and Earth.\nI neither see nor hear,\nso my spirit does not leave the body,\nand I endure with the Dao.\nI divide with Heaven and Earth,\ngoverning with one breath,\npreserving my root foundation.\"*\nThe **root foundation** refers to the doctrine of **spirit, qi, and essence**—\nthis is the meaning of *\"filling the abdomen.\"*\n\n**Weakening the will.**\n*\"Weakening\"* means *\"holding firm.\"*\nThe **will** is the leader of **qi**,\nand **qi** is what fills the body.\nNow, those who stumble or rush—\nthis is **qi**.\nThose who practice well\nmust, at dawn before engaging with things,\nwhen **qi** is clear and bright,\nconstantly hold their will,\nnot exhausting their **qi**,\nso that it becomes vast and unobstructed,\nnot leading to stagnation or loss.\nThen, perhaps, within the three hundred sixty bones,\nthere will be no blockages.\n\n**Mencius** said: *\"If nourishment is obtained, nothing fails to grow.\nIf nourishment is lost, nothing fails to wither.\"*\n**Confucius** said: *\"Hold fast, and it remains; release, and it perishes.\nIts coming and going have no fixed time—\nwho knows its direction?\nOnly the heart is like this.\"*\nThis is the saying of *\"weakening the will.\"*\n\n**Strengthening the bones.**\nBy *\"strengthening the bones,\"* it is meant to grasp firmly, steady the feet,\nraise the waist and arch the chest—\nthis is the path of cultivation.\nFor the Sage’s governance\nfirst empties the heart to establish principle,\nthen fills the abdomen to solidify essence,\nweakens the will to preserve **qi**,\nand strengthens the bones to walk the **Dao**.\n\nYet, is there no explanation for the way of *\"strengthening the bones\"*?\nWhen great practitioners complete their work,\nthey then withdraw fire and extract lead,\nallowing the **Original Qi** to ascend from the **Tailbone** along the **Spinal Column** and **Upper Gate** into the **Mud Ball**,\nwhere **qi** transforms into **saliva**,\nwhich is then drawn from the upper palate,\nheld in the mouth,\nswallowed three times after gently tapping the teeth,\nand directed with intent to the **Elixir Field**,\nwhere it is further nurtured by the **Fire and Water** cycles—\nthis is called *\"Jade-Liquid Reverted Elixir.\"*\nThis is the meaning of *\"strengthening the bones.\"*\n\nAlways let the people be without knowledge and without desire.\n\nThe unknowing is purity, the desireless is simplicity, and purity and simplicity are the Way of *wuwei*.\n\nTo always govern the people thus means that the Sage first practices it himself, and only then can he make the people unknowing and desireless, pure and simple in *wuwei*.\n\nFor only when the ruler’s virtue is manifest can he make the people’s virtue manifest.\n\nAs in the age of primal antiquity, when the world was in *wuwei*—when the ruler above was in *wuwei*, then those below were also in *wuwei*.\n\nThe ruler is like the wind, the people like the grass.\nWhen the wind does not bend the grass, such a thing does not exist in the world.\n\nThe customs of the unknowing, the winds of simplicity and purity—these belong to the age of supreme antiquity and its virtue.\n\nZhuangzi said: In the age of supreme virtue, the worthy are not honored, the capable are not employed. The ruler is like a branch of a tree, the people like wild deer—straightforward without knowing it as *ren*, loving one another without knowing it as *yi*, sincere without knowing it as *zhong*, faithful without knowing it as *xin*. They move clumsily yet govern one another without calling it a blessing.\n\nThus, they act without striving, serve without leaving a trace. Filial sons do not flatter their parents, loyal ministers do not fawn on their lords—this is the custom of purity and simplicity.\n\nTherefore, the Sage first transforms himself from above, and thus it is said: *\"Always govern the people by making them unknowing and desireless.\"*\n\nTo make the wise dare not act.\n\nIn the age of antiquity, the customs were pure, and there were no distinctions of *san gang*—lord-subject, father-son, husband-wife—and no visible *wu chang*—*ren, yi, li, zhi, xin*. All shared equally, yet did not know how they obtained it; all were born naturally, yet did not know how they came to be. Dwelling with beasts, mingling with all things, how could they know of noble and base?\n\nIn their shared unknowing, their virtue did not depart; in their shared desirelessness, this is called *suzhu*—the uncarved block—and the people returned to their nature.\n\nIf such pure and simple folk were to encounter clever and bright scholars, though they possessed knowledge, they would have no use for it.\n\nThus it is said: *\"To make the wise dare not act.\"*\n\nTo practice *wuwei* is to have nothing that cannot be governed.\n\nThe virtue of the Sage-King takes heaven and earth as its root, *Dao* and virtue as its master, and *wuwei* as its constant.\n\nTo be in *wuwei* is to govern the world with abundance.\nTo act with *wei* is to be used by the world yet remain insufficient.\n\n*Wuwei* is the balance of heaven and earth, the ultimate of *Dao* and virtue. To understand this and sit in the south-facing hall is to be Yao as sovereign.\nTo understand this and face north is to be Shun as minister.\n\nTo hold this in high station is the virtue of the Emperor and Son of Heaven.\nTo hold this in low station is the *Dao* of the ancient and pure Sage-Kings.\n\nTo retreat and dwell in leisure among rivers, seas, mountains, and forests is the way of the recluse.\nTo advance and govern the world is to achieve great deeds and a resounding name, uniting all under heaven.\n\nThus it is said: *\"To practice wuwei is to have nothing that cannot be governed.\"*\n\nYang Zhiren said: *\"To not honor the worthy makes the people not contend, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\"*\n\nTo not honor the worthy means that wealth and nobility are not desired, titles and emoluments are not possessed. One does not attend the Son of Heaven above, nor pay respects to ministers below. Thus one possesses the virtue of non-contention.\n\nTo not prize rare goods means that strange treasures, precious metals, and fine jade are but external things. The heart is serene, the people content. Externally, no desires are seen; internally, the mind is undisturbed.\n\nThe enlightened see yet do not see, moving freely in all directions.\nThe ancients said: *\"If I have no mind toward all things, how can all things not surround me?\"*\n\nThe Sage’s practice is to empty the heart of all attachments, fill the belly to preserve the essence, weaken the will to remain humble, and strengthen the bones to nurture the boundless.\n\nMy heart is pure, the people’s hearts are simple. Without desire, without knowledge, the wise dare not act.\n\nTo be in *wuwei* yet accomplish all is to have nothing that cannot be governed.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: *\"Yanzi’s limbs were exhausted, his brilliance discarded, his form abandoned, his wisdom set aside—this is to not honor the worthy.\"*\n\nEating coarse grains, drinking from a gourd, dwelling in a humble lane—though others could not endure the hardship, Yan Hui did not change his joy.\n\nTo not prize rare goods is to not steal; to not see desire is to not be disturbed—this is the way.\n\nTo nourish the proper with ease is humility;\nto be lowly yet honored is the Sage’s way of emptying the heart, filling the belly, weakening the will, and strengthening the bones—without knowledge, without desire, in *wuwei* yet without failing to govern.\n\nYu Qingzhong said: *\"To not honor the worthy makes the people not contend, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\"*\n\nTo not honor the worthy makes the people not contend—this means that if you do not boast of your abilities, none will contend with you in skill.\n\nTo not prize rare goods makes the people not steal—this means that if one does not covet, even if rewarded, one will not take it, as Gongsun Long said.\n\nTo not see what is desirable makes the heart not disturbed—this is the most critical teaching of the *Taishang*.\n\nZigong, seeing the splendor of the capital and taking delight, saw what was desirable and his heart was disturbed. Yet upon returning and hearing the Master’s *Dao*, he found joy—seeing no desire, his heart was undisturbed.\n\nDamo faced the wall at Shaolin for nine years—this too was the meaning.\n\nThe training of the worthy is like my sole virtue being laborious. Generally, those who seek to excel in all things are called worthy—such as those who love grandeur and achievement, who exhaust armies and wage wars, always seeking to surpass predecessors, not merely boasting of cleverness and strength.\n\nHan Wen, emulating the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s quietude, used humble words and thick gifts, and pacified distant peoples, yet said, *\"I am a concubine’s son of the High Emperor\"*—this was to not honor the worthy.\n\nQi Gaozu said: *\"If I were to govern the world for ten years, I would make gold as common as dirt.\"* This was to not prize rare goods.\n\nGenerally, women are what people desire, as are wealth and nobility. Dogs, horses, music, and women; sons, daughters, jade, and silk; towering halls and carved walls—all are enough to arouse desire. Only by seeing nothing externally can the mind remain unshaken within.\n\nThe Sage’s governance of the world—what other Way could there be?\nTo receive them into the realm of thoughtlessness and carelessness, to empty their hearts.\nYet for the eight-mouth household, one must ensure they know no hunger—\nfor banditry arises from poverty.\n\nTransform them with gentleness, teach them with softness, to weaken their resolve.\nYet one must also compel them to labor their sinews and bones in service,\nlest they grow fat from ease and dwell in idleness without discipline.\n\nThe four characters—*emptiness, fullness, weakness, strength*—\nare like mother and child.\nTo fill their bellies and strengthen their bones—\nthis is where the Sage’s meticulous and subtle considerations lie.\n\nGovern thus, and one sees the people wandering in a state of unknowing and ignorance,\nwith few thoughts and scant desires.\nThough they possess cleverness, there is nothing for it to apply itself.\n\nAll this is the Sage’s governance through *wuwei*—\nhow could the world not be governed?\n\nThe *Six Emptinesses* say:\n*\"Do not honor the worthy, so the people do not contend.*\nFor a state must have its worthy ministers to assist in governance—\nif not, there is no way to achieve order.\nTo not honor the worthy is not to reject the worthy—\nit is merely to not exalt them.\nIf the ruler opens the door to honoring the worthy,\nthen those below will harbor ambitions to advance,\nhence it is said: *‘Do not honor the worthy, so the people do not contend.’*\n\n*Do not prize rare goods, so the people do not steal.*\nWealth and goods—all under heaven desire them.\nIf the ruler values and cherishes them,\nthen those below, though desiring them, find them hard to obtain—\nand difficulty in obtaining them stirs the private impulse to pilfer.\nIf the ruler regards wealth as common as dirt,\nneither prizing nor loving it,\nand makes goods easy to obtain,\nthen how could the people harbor thieving intentions?\n\n*Do not display what is desirable, so the heart remains undisturbed.*\nThis has two interpretations.\nOne interprets *‘see’* as the ruler not displaying what is desirable to the people,\nso their hearts naturally settle.\nIf the ruler displays what is desirable,\nthen those below will emulate it—\nhow could their hearts not be disturbed?\n\nAnother interpretation of *‘see’* speaks of self-cultivation:\nwhen music, women, and luxuries fill one’s sight,\nif one does not see what is desired, the heart remains settled.\nIf one sees what is desired, how could it not be disturbed?\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance is at its strongest in fortifying the bones.\n\nTherefore, ancient Sages governed the state by first governing themselves,\nand to govern themselves, they first emptied their hearts—\nnot allowing human desires to agitate them,\nso the heart naturally becomes empty.\n\nEmpty, still—\nthe heart still, then *qi* settles;\n*qi* settled, then the belly naturally fills.\nThus, to empty the heart, fill the belly, and weaken the will—\nthis means not competing with things.\nWithout competition, *shenqi* harmonizes and rejoices,\nand blood and essence flow abundantly, marrow fills, and bones grow strong—\nthis is the true way of nurturing life,\na certainty that must be believed.\nTo govern the state thus is to bring wealth to the nation and peace to the people—\nwhat more could one ask?\n\nTo always keep the people in a state of unknowing and desirelessness\nis to achieve perfect governance.\nYet the people’s desires are inevitable—\nhow then can one make them desireless and ignorant?\n\nStill, if the ruler does not honor the worthy, does not prize goods,\nand does not display what is desirable,\nand the people follow above as grass follows the wind,\ntheir nature returns to simplicity,\neach content in their place,\nclothed and fed, wandering at ease—\nwhat knowing, what desiring would they have?\n\nYet if the ruler’s conduct is sincere and the people remain untransformed,\neven if they have knowledge and desire, they dare not act upon it—\ntransformation is the work of many.\n\nTo act through *wuwei* is to govern completely—\nfor if the ruler exalts the worthy, prizes goods, and displays what is desirable,\nyet truly practices *wuwei*,\nthen the world will govern itself.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"To act through wuwei is to govern completely.\"*\n\nSu Jingjing said:\n*\"From ‘Do not honor the worthy, so the people do not contend’\nto ‘then there will be nothing that is not governed.’*\nThis chapter focuses on Laozi’s original intent:\n*‘Do not display what is desirable, so the heart remains undisturbed.’*\n\nThe worthy are those who excel beyond others.\nIf I exalt those who excel beyond others,\nthen those who do not excel will rise to contend.\nRare goods are treasures.\nIf I prize treasures, the people will conceive thieving intentions.\nThis is like Ji Kangzi’s concern over theft,\nwhere Confucius said:\n*\"If you yourself do not desire them,\neven if rewarded, they will not steal.\"*\nThis is the same meaning.\n\nGenerally, if the people’s desires are not displayed,\ntheir hearts naturally remain unagitated.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s *Gèn* hexagram says:\n*\"Gèn its back, it does not grasp its body;\nit walks through its courtyard, yet does not see its person—\nno blame.\"*\nThe commentators say:\n*\"Gèn* means to stop.\nThe heart’s desires are always stopped where the eyes do not see.\nThe back is where nothing is seen—\nif seen, then desire arises,\nand once desire arises, it cannot be stopped.\n*Gèn its back*—it does not grasp its body—\nmeaning it does not see its body.\nIf the eyes cannot even see the body,\nthen desire naturally does not arise.\nThough the courtyard is near and one walks past people,\nthey are not seen because *gèn* stops the back.\nIf one sees the splendor outside and takes delight,\nthen the heart becomes agitated.\nWhen external things do not intrude,\nthe heart remains undisturbed,\nand there is no fault.\nThis is Laozi’s *‘Do not display what is desirable, so the heart remains undisturbed.’*\n\nLaozi speaks of ancient Sages’ governance,\nstriving to make the people’s hearts empty, their bellies full,\ntheir wills weak, and their bones strong.\nAn empty heart means not allowing external things to disturb it.\nA full belly means merely ensuring the people are fed.\nA weak will means making the people not see what is desirable,\nso they do not contend.\nStrong bones mean merely ensuring the people have strength to bear burdens.\nIf the people are ignorant and desireless, they become simple and practical,\nforming customs naturally.\nThough there may be clever and cunning among them—\none in a hundred—\nthe simple and practical far outnumber the clever and cunning,\nso who would dare to rebel?\n\nEven today, the people of the mountains and forests differ from those of the markets and cliffs in their sincerity and cleverness—\nnot because of anything else,\nbut because the market people see much that is desirable,\nwhile the mountain people see little that is desirable.\n\n「Thus the actions of the Sage are all in tranquility and non-action, and naturally all things are governed without effort. The Sage does not exalt the worthy, nor treasure rare goods—both measures ensure the people do not see what is desirable, and their hearts remain undisturbed.\n\nHow unlike the later ages, where rewards for merit and incentives for ability only provoke the world’s strife, while valuing rare and costly wealth only spawns thievery—these are not the ways of non-action and tranquil governance.\n\n*The *Shíyí* [Gathering of Lost Sayings] states: The Master of Virtue said: \"Empty the heart, fill the belly\"—this is the same as the Sage not exalting, not treasuring, and not showing what is desirable, thereby making the people ignorant and desireless. When they have no knowledge to covet, they do not dare to act.\n\nSome say \"empty the heart to nurture the Dao,\" which, though not harmful in principle, is not the true meaning of this passage.\n\n*From *Zhūzǐ Pángzhèng* [Collateral Proofs of the Masters]:\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: In the age of perfect virtue, the Sage does not exalt the worthy, nor employ the capable. The ruler is like a branch of a tree, the people like wild deer. Correctness is upheld without calling it righteousness, mutual love is practiced without calling it benevolence, substance is honored without calling it loyalty, fittingness is observed without calling it trustworthiness, and spontaneous movements are guided without calling them gifts. Thus, actions are performed without boasting, and deeds are done without seeking praise.\n\n*The *Han Feizi* says: A villager of Song found a rough piece of jade and presented it to the Lord of the State, Zi Han, who refused it. The villager said: \"This is a treasure! It should be made into a nobleman’s vessel, not used by commoners.\" Zi Han replied: \"You consider jade a treasure, but I consider not accepting your jade a treasure.\" Thus, the villager desired jade, while Zi Han did not—hence the saying, \"Desire what is not desired, and value what is difficult to obtain.\"\n\n*The *Wénzǐ* says: A true man of virtue is serene and without thought, calm and without concern. He takes heaven as his roof, earth as his carriage, the four seasons as his steeds, and yin-yang as his reins. He travels where there are no paths, wanders where there are no traces, and exits where there are no gates. To take heaven as his roof means to cover all things without limit; to take earth as his carriage means to bear all things without burden. The four seasons as steeds mean to harness all transformations; yin-yang as reins means to provide for all needs. Thus, he moves swiftly without agitation, travels far without weariness, his limbs remain still, his wisdom undiminished—yet he shines brightly throughout the world. Grasping the essence of the Dao, he gazes upon the boundless realm, so that all worldly affairs are beyond his doing. Following nature’s spontaneity, he guides it, and all changes of things are beyond his control. Seizing its core and returning to it, the Sage cultivates his inner foundation without adornment in externals, fortifying his spirit while suppressing his perceptions. Hence, he is detached and effortless yet accomplishes all things; he governs without action yet nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nWhat is meant by non-action is not to act before things; what is meant by non-governance is not to alter nature; what is meant by nothing remaining ungoverned is to follow things’ natural course.\n\nShí Tán said: Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from striving. Not treasuring rare goods prevents thievery. Not showing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed. The previous passage expounded the principle of *wúmíng* [namelessness], while this one expounds the principle of *wúdù* [desirelessness]. To exalt the worthy makes their names desirable, and the people contend for them. To treasure rare goods makes profit desirable, and the people will steal for it. Only by not showing names as desirable does the name not disturb their hearts; only by not showing profit as desirable does profit not disturb their hearts. What is desired and can disturb the heart is not limited to these two. Let these two suffice as examples.\n\nLín Yōngzhāi interpreted \"not exalting the worthy\" as \"not self-praising,\" and Huáng Màocái explained \"not showing what is desirable\" as \"not seeing that the world has what is desirable\"—both interpretations are superior.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance empties the heart, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones. When desire does not disturb the heart, the heart is empty; when the heart is not overcome by desire, it has a steadfast center and is full. Hence, \"fill the belly.\" When the will does not seek externals, the will is weak; though weak, if the *qi* is not moved by the will, the bones grow ever stronger—hence, \"strengthen the bones.\" The Sage constantly makes the people ignorant and desireless, so even those who know do not dare to act. If they are ignorant and desireless, though they may have knowledge, they have no use for it. Practicing non-action, nothing remains ungoverned. The Sage’s governance is simply non-action. Yet he can make the people not be disturbed by what is desirable—this is what is meant by \"nothing remains ungoverned.\"\n\nThe previous passage arose from the principle of *wúmíng* [namelessness], while this one arises from *wúdù* [desirelessness], yet both return to non-action. Non-action is indeed the embodiment of the Dao.\n\n*End of Volume Eight of *Zhēnyì Jiéyì* [Collected Meanings of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue]. *Beginning of Volume Nine of *Zhēnyì Jiéyì*.*」\n\n**Volume Nine of *Zhēnyì Jiéyì* [Collected Meanings of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue]**\n\n**Chapter: *Dàochōng* [The Dao’s Purity]**\n\nMaster Yǒngyuǎn, with profound virtue along the Dao’s mysterious path, supervised the compilation by Sì Wěiyǒng, a minister of the *Guōnmì Yùanshū* [Imperial Secretariat]. The text was annotated by Dīng Yìdōng, a former *Tàifǔ Shì Bù* [Treasury Bureau Clerk] and *Guōnmì Yuàn Biānxiū* [Editor of the Secretariat], with critical notes appended.\n\n**Critical Notes:**\nThe *Héshànggōng* [Master of the Yellow River] composed the *Chapter of the Nameless Source*, while Zhào Shí’ān [Master of the Real Forest] wrote the *Chapter on the Propagation of the Harmonious Dao*.\n\n**Emperor Xuānzōng’s Commentary:**\nThe previous chapter elucidated that nobility and rank are not to be pursued—non-action reveals the ultimate truth. This chapter expounds that the wondrous origin’s function lies in action without contrivance. It begins with *Dàochōng* [The Dao’s Purity], demonstrating the principle of supreme emptiness as the root of all things. Next, it speaks of *cuòjiě* [dulling and releasing], clarifying how purity in application resolves discord, concluding with the analogy of the *Xiàngdì* [August Sovereign] to guide all to its intent.\n\n**Du Guāngtíng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Dao’s operation is boundless—vast as heaven and earth, subtle as a hair’s tip. In its natural repose, it neither lacks nor overflows. Applied to the body, it merges light and dust into unity; within the self, it transforms sharpness into harmony. Stretching across countless eons, it precedes even the *Xiàngdì*, standing first among all teachings. Thus, all existence finds its ultimate refuge in the Dao.\n\n*Qu* [trend/tendency] means *xiàng* [to turn toward].\n\n**Zhang Chōngyìng’s Interpretation:**\nThis chapter teaches that from the sovereign to the commoner, all who embody the natural Dao must recognize its boundless, infinite nature—mysterious and formless, yet ever-present. Hence, it is called *wúyuán* [the Nameless Source].\n\nThe Dao’s purity, when applied, is never full—\nDeep as the source, it seems the origin of all things.\nDulling their sharpness,\nReleasing their entanglements,\nHarmonizing their brilliance,\nUnifying their dust.\nVague as if it exists—\nI do not know whose child it is,\nYet it precedes the *Xiàngdì*.\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n*\"Or not full\"* (*huò bù yíng*)—alternate readings: *\"as if not full\"* (*sì bù yíng*), *\"seems not full\"* (*sì bù yíng*).\n*\"Vague as if it exists\"* (*kān xī sì cún*)—alternate: *\"seems to exist\"* (*sì rú cún*).\n*\"Whose child\"* (*shéi zhī zǐ*)—alternate: *\"whose child, indeed\"* (*qí shéi zhī zǐ*).\n\n**Héshànggōng’s Explanation:**\n*The Dao’s purity, when applied*—\n*Purity* (*chōng*) means *zhōng* [centrality].\nThe Dao conceals its name, hides its merit—its function lies in centrality, never full.\n*\"Or\"* (*huò*) means *cháng* [constant].\nThe Dao is ever modest and empty, never overflowing.\n*Deep as the source*—\nThe Dao’s depth is unfathomable, yet it seems the ancestral root of all things.\n*Dulling their sharpness*—\n*Sharpness* (*ruì*) means *jìn* [advancement].\nWhen people eagerly strive for fame and gain, their ambition must be tempered—this is the Dao’s way, not self-imposed.\n*Releasing their entanglements*—\n*Entanglements* (*fēn*) mean *jiēgēn* [rooted conflicts].\nOne must reflect on the Dao’s non-action to dissolve them.\n*Harmonizing their brilliance*—\n\n「Though one may possess a singular insightful wisdom (*dújiàn zhī míng*), one must know the depths of obscurity (*ànmèi*), lest they disrupt others with their arrogance (*bù dāng yǐ ruì luàn rén yě*).\n**Equalize with the common dust.**\nOne must align with the multitude in their filth and dust (*tóng yú zhòngshù tóng gòuchén*), not set oneself apart in singularity (*bù dāng zì bié shū*).\n\n**Serene as if it exists.**\nSpeak of it with tranquil stillness (*zhàn yān ruì ruò cún*), thus enduring eternally without decay (*gù néng chángcún bù wáng*).\n\n**I do not know whose child it is.**\nLaozi says, *\"I know not whence it springs.\"* (*Wú zhīshì shuō bù zhī qí shēng*)\n\n**Resembling the Sovereign before the Emperor.**\nThe Dao exists prior to the Celestial Sovereign (*Tiān Dì zhī xiān*), thus declaring the Dao as born before Heaven and Earth (*dào zì zài tiān dì zhī qián, cǐ yán dào nǎi xiān tiān dì shēng yě*).\n\n**To this day, it abides—**\nBecause it remains serene and tranquil (*néng zhànrán ānjìng*), unburdened by labor, it seeks to guide people in refining their conduct (*xiūshēn fǎdào*).\n\n**Heshang Gong’s further elucidation:**\nThe Dao’s purity, when applied—\nResembling the Sovereign before the Emperor (*zhì xiàng dì zhī xiān*).\nHe who grasps only one household’s measure (*zhí yījiā zhī liàng*) cannot govern the household;\nHe who grasps only one kingdom’s measure (*zhí yīguó zhī liàng*) cannot establish the kingdom.\n**Exhausting strength to lift heavy burdens, yet failing to serve its purpose.**\nThus, though one may know all things are governed (*rén suī zhī wànwù zhì yě*), if governance does not follow the **Two Principles** (*èr yí zhī dào*), it cannot endure (*zé bù néng shàn yě*).\nEarth, though substantial in form (*xíngpò*), without conforming to Heaven’s **virtue** (*dé*), cannot preserve its eternal tranquility (*bù néng wánqí níng*).\nHeaven, though refined in essence (*jīngxiàng*), without conforming to the Dao’s **virtue** (*dé*), cannot sustain its purity (*bù néng bǎo qí jīng*).\n**Purity applied—its use cannot be exhausted.**\n**Fullness begets solidity, yet solidity brings overflow; thus purity applied again does not overflow—its boundless nature is now fully revealed.**\nThough form be vast, it cannot encumber its essence (*xíng suī dà bù néng lèi qí tǐ*);\nThough deeds be frequent, they cannot fill its measure (*shì suī yīn bù néng chōng qí liàng*).\nAll things abandon this and seek their sovereign—\nWhere is their sovereign’s abode?\nIs it not profound as if resembling the root of all things (*bù yì shàn wànwù zhī zōng hū*)?\n\n**The Commentary says:**\nTo temper without loss, to disperse without effort—\n**Harmonizing its brilliance** without staining its essence (*hé guāng ér bù wū qí tǐ*),\n**Equalizing with the dust** without altering its truth (*tóng chén ér bù yú qí zhēn*).\nIs it not serene as if it exists (*bù yì zhàn yān ruì cún hū*)?\n\nEarth adheres to its form (*xíng*), yet its **virtue** (*dé*) cannot surpass its capacity to sustain (*zài*).\nHeaven upholds its essence (*xiàng*), yet its **virtue** (*dé*) cannot surpass its coverage (*fù*).\nNeither Heaven nor Earth can reach it—\nIs it not resembling the Sovereign before the Emperor (*bù yì shàn dì zhī xiān hū*)?\n**Emperor** (*Dì*), here meaning the **Celestial Sovereign** (*Tiān Dì*).\n\n**Emperor Tang Ming Huang’s Explanation:**\nThe Dao’s purity, when applied—\n**Or** (*huò*) means **constantly** (*bù yíng*).\nThe Dao moves through **purity** (*chōng*), generating **harmonious qi** (*héqì*), and its use brings forth all things (*yòng shēng wànwù*), yet it never overflows with its merit (*yǒu shēngchéng zhī gōng, zēng bù yíngmǎn*).\n**Saying \"or\" as if it exists**—\nThis is the Dao’s ineffable essence (*yú dào bù gǎn zhèngyán yě*).\n**Profound as the source**—\n**Profound** (*yuān*), here meaning **deep and tranquil** (*shēn jìng*).\nThe Dao constantly generates all things yet never overflows (*dào cháng shēng wànwù ér bù yíngmǎn*), its wondrous origin being profound and tranquil (*miàoběn yuān shēn jìng*), thus resembling the sovereign root of all things (*gù shì wànwù zhī zōngzhǔ yě*).\n\n**The Commentary further expounds:**\nPurity (*chōng*) is **emptiness** (*xū*).\nIt means the Dao employs **emptiness** (*xū*) as its function (*wéi yòng yě*).\n**Harmonious qi**, being pure and empty (*héqì chōngxū*), thus serves as the Dao’s use (*gù wéi dào yòng*).\nIts use generates all things (*yòng shēng wànwù*), and all things receive its merit (*wù bèi qí gōng*).\nWhen discussing merit, things seem to doubt its brilliance (*lùn gōng zé wù yí qí guāngdà*), yet when speaking of purity, the Dao remains ever unoverflowing (*yǔ chōng zé dào cháng bù yíngmǎn*).\n**Or** (*huò*), its wondrous origin being profound and tranquil (*miàoběn shēnjìng*), constantly as the root of all things (*cháng wéi wànwù zhī zōng*).\n**Saying \"or\" as if it exists**—\nThe Dao has no fixed form (*dào fēi yǒu fǎ*), thus it cannot be spoken of directly (*gù bù zhèngyán ěr*).\nAll else follows this pattern (*tā jiē fǎng cǐ*).\n**Tempering their sharpness, dispersing their entanglements.**\nThe Dao, through **purity** (*chōng*) and **harmony** (*hé*), can suppress the **advancing** (*jìn*) and **sharp** (*ruì*), release the **rooted conflicts** (*jiēgēn*).\nIf the **common scholars** (*súxué*) seek to restore, their entanglements only deepen (*ruò súxué qiú fù, zé mí jiégēn yě*).\n\n**The Commentary says:**\n**Temper** (*cuò*) means **suppress** (*yì zhǐ*).\n**Sharp** (*ruì*) means **advancing** (*jìn*).\n**Release** (*jiě*) means **dispel** (*shì sàn*).\n\nThe **purity and emptiness** of the Dao’s function knows no resistance—thus, the **advancing and sharp** hearts, the **entangled and chaotic** affairs, all naturally **suppress and disperse** when one contemplates the Dao’s **purity and harmony**.\n\nThis is how one **guides humanity** to understand the Dao’s function.\n\n**The Commentary says:**\nThe **common scholars** seek to restore their original nature (*súxué qiú fù qí chū*), yet their **advancing sharpness** and **entangled chaos** arise from desire—thus, contemplating the Dao **suppresses and disperses** them, while **common learning** only **deepens the knots**.\n\n**Harmonizing its light, blending with the dust.**\nThe Dao is nowhere absent, yet wherever it is, it is always **non-existent**.\nIn light, it is one with light; in dust, it is one with dust.\nOne with light and dust, yet neither light nor dust.\n**Deep and vast**, as if something exists.\n\n**Harmonizing its light and blending with the dust**, yet its **mystic origin** remains **unobstructed**—thus, it appears **deep and vast**, as if something persists.\n\n**The Commentary says:**\nThe Dao’s **purity and emptiness** in its function is **unexhausted** in all things.\nIn light, it merges with light; in dust, it merges with dust.\nNowhere is it absent, yet wherever it is, it is always **non-existent**.\nThrough **purity and harmony**, it can **blend light and dust**, yet its **mystic origin** remains **deep and still, unmixed**.\nThus, it is said to appear as if something exists.\n\n**I do not know whose child I am, yet I resemble the Emperor before creation.**\n\nI do not know my origin—**the Dao is not born**, for it has no form.\nThe Dao seems to exist before the Emperor, for the Emperor is the **sovereign of all things**.\n**Resemble** means **to appear as**.\n\n**The Commentary says:**\n**\"I\"** refers to Laozi’s self-designation.\n**Resemble** means **to appear as**.\nLaozi says: *\"I see the Dao’s purity and emptiness, giving rise to all things together.\nSeeking its source, I cannot fathom its origin.\nSince the Dao has no father, who could know it as a child?\nAll things depend on the Dao for birth, thus it seems to exist before the Emperor.\"*\n\n**The Commentary says:**\nThe Emperor is the **sovereign of all transformations**.\n*The Book of Changes* says: *\"The Emperor emerges from **Zhen (☳)**.\"*\n**Zhen** is the **eastern hexagram**, the **minor yang qi**, the **source of transformation and birth**.\nNow, the heir apparent resides in the **eastern palace**, in the **minor yang position**, ascending to the throne as the **period of Zhen’s emergence**—this symbolizes the **beginning of heaven and earth nurturing all things**.\n\n**Manifesting as an image** is called **resemblance**—**the unseen is qi**, **manifesting form is image**, the **first of all things**.\nThe **first of all things**, resembling the Emperor, stands before him.\nThe **Great Dao’s purity and emptiness** is the **root of all things**.\nThe Dao is always **humble and unfilled**, **pure and harmonious**, **serene and still**, dwelling within—**deep, mysterious, and tranquil**, the **sovereign of all things**.\nThus, if things lose the Dao’s **purity and harmony**, they will **decay and perish**.\nIf a person loses the Dao’s **purity and harmony**, they will **die and be extinguished**.\nIf a ruler loses the Dao’s **purity and harmony**, governance will be **disordered and the people will scatter**.\nIf a subject loses the Dao’s **purity and harmony**, their **reputation will vanish and they will be humiliated**.\n\nThus, one knows that the Dao of **purity and harmony** is what all things **rely upon for stability**—it is the **root of all things**.\nSpeak of its **function in all things**, and it is **bright and vast**.\nSeek its **mystic origin**, and it is **deep and ever-empty**.\nThe Dao cannot be **directly spoken of as existing**, yet all things have the Dao.\n**Following this pattern**, one does not dare speak of it directly.\n\n**Suppressing their sharpness, dispersing their entanglements.**\nGovernance through the Dao of **purity and harmony** means there is no **advancing sharpness** to harm things, no **chaotic affairs** to harm people.\nIf no harm comes to things, then **all nations will come to court**, the **four barbarians will turn to transformation**, **weapons will not rise**, and **grievances will not arise**.\nThey will not **pursue territorial expansion or conquest**, nor **oppress the weak or few**.\n\nIf no harm comes to people, then **they will be governed in due season**, **taxes and labor will be light**, and **families will be ample, people sufficient**.\n\nFor those who **govern themselves**, they **dispel entanglements and suppress sharpness**—\nexternally, there is no **competition or intrusion**,\ninternally, they **embrace clarity and emptiness**,\ntheir **spirit is at ease, their body secure**,\nand they **find tranquility in natural ease**.\n\n**Guiding humanity to clarify the Dao’s function** is to show that **humanity must depend on the Dao**.\n\nAs *Zhuangzi’s* **\"Xiu Xing\" chapter** says: *\"The common scholars seek to restore their original nature\"*—\nonce humanity has become entangled in worldly affairs, yet they wish to **recover their primordial nature through worldly learning**, their pursuit only **further distorts the Way**.\n**Common learning** only **deepens the knots**—\nthe **advancing sharpness** and **chaotic affairs**, if not **suppressed and dispersed by the Dao**, will only **bind tighter in worldly entanglement**, becoming **unbreakable**.\n\n**Common scholars** are those who **pursue worldly knowledge**, not the **Way of daily diminishment**.\n\n**Harmonizing its light until it is deep and vast, as if something exists.**\nThe Dao of **purity and harmony** pervades all beings,\n**vast and unobstructed**, yet all things are within it—\nthis is **harmonizing light and blending with dust**.\n**Light** is **clarity and purity**; **dust** is **chaos and confusion**.\nThe **virtuous person** does not **stand out rigidly**, but **aligns with the multitude**.\n**Buon** means **lacking**.\n\nThough the Dao pervades all beings, its **mystic origin** remains **congealed in stillness, pure and empty**, never **exhausted or absent**—\nthus, it is said to **persist as if something exists**.\n\n**I do not know whose child I am, yet I resemble the Emperor before creation.**\nThe Emperor is the **first of all transformations**, the **original sovereign**, whose **form and image first emerged**, whom **rulers shepherd**—\nthus, it is said to **resemble the Emperor**.\n\nThe **Great Dao’s purity and emptiness** gives rise to all transformations—\nthus, it exists **before the Emperor**.\nThe **Great Sage Laozi**—could he not know the **root of the Dao**?\nHe **feigns doubt and resemblance** to **awaken those lost in worldly affairs**.\n\nAs before, the **Great Dao cannot be directly spoken of**.\n\n*The Book of Changes* says: *\"The Emperor emerges from **Zhen (☳)**—all things are born.\n**Uniform in Xun (☴)**, all things are purified.\n**Encountered in Li (☲)**, the sage faces south, bringing enlightenment.\n**Fulfills its role in Kun (☷)**, all things are nourished.\n**Explains itself in Dui (☱)**, all things find joy.\"*\n\n---\n*(Note: Some characters were unclear in the original text; \"□\" placeholders indicate missing or ambiguous terms. \"Xiu

return.**\n\n**Completion in **Gen (☶)**, the beginning and end of all things.**\n\nNow, all things emerge from **Zhen (☳)** and conclude in **Gen (☶)**.\nConcluding yet perpetually renewing, following the Dao’s endless transformations—\nand here lies the **Symbol of the Emperor**,\nexisting before **Zhen (☳)**’s emergence,\nwhile the **Great Dao** precedes even the **Symbol of the Emperor**,\nthus it reigns as sovereign of **generation and transformation**,\nthe primal origin of heaven and earth.\n\nThe **Human Sovereign** embodies the Dao with sincerity,\nhis resolve never

illuminate all,\ncontaining the dust of the world while maintaining dignity.\nHis **effortless transformation** may well align with the **Symbol of the Emperor**!\n\nThe **Sovereign of the Song Dao** said:\n*\"The Dao is vast, yet when applied, it seems never full.\nThe Dao has sentiment and trust, thus it has use.\nEffortless, it is formless—thus it never overflows.\nThe **Scripture** states: All things bear yin and embrace yang,\nthe **vacuous qi** to achieve harmony.\nIf the Dao leans too much toward yang, it becomes forceful,\nor oversteps its bounds.\nIf it leans too much toward yin, it grows weak,\nor falls short.\nWithout excess or deficiency, this is the **vacuous qi**.\nVacuous means central—\nthis is the **Great Harmony**.\nThe high are humbled, the low are elevated,\nthe excessive is tempered, the lacking is supplemented—\nthe Dao’s application finds no end yet always attains its center.\nPour from it, yet it never overflows;\ndraw from it, yet it never exhausts.\nThe more one gives to others, the more one possesses oneself;\nthe more one shares with others, the more one gains.\nThe Dao’s essence is like the **Great Void**,\nencompassing the six directions—\nhow could it ever overflow?\nDeep as the primal source of all things.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said:\n*\"The **frog’s** stillness is a well,\nstanding water’s stillness is a well,\nflowing water’s stillness is a well.\nDeep and tranquil, it does not mix with things—\nthis is the Dao’s essence.\nOnly the void gathers all reality,\nonly the stillness governs all motion—\nthis is the root of all things,\nthe foundation of the **One Transformation**.\nThus it is called the **primal source of all things**.\nYet the Dao itself has no root—\nthings naturally depend upon it,\nso it only *seems* to be their source.\"*\n\n**Blunting its sharpness** to **unify with the dust**—\nthe keen, the injurious;\nthe chaotic, the divisive.\n**Blunting the sharp** prevents conflict,\n**dissolving the chaotic** avoids disorder.\n**Harmonizing its light**—as **Zhuangzi** said:\n*\"Shining yet not dazzling!\"*\n**Unifying with the dust**—as **Zhuangzi** said:\n*\"Without things clinging and swaying, yet aligned with its waves.\"*\n\nIf one’s sincerity is unbroken,\nyet his scheming forms a blinding light—\nhow could this be **harmonizing its light**?\nIf one polishes his wisdom to startle the foolish,\nand refines his conduct to expose the filthy—\nhis brilliance like revealing the sun and moon—\nhow could this be **unifying with the dust**?\n\nThe **Sage blunts the sharp**—thus in his dealings, he neither harms nor is harmed.\n**Dissolving the chaotic**, he neither plots with cleverness nor clings to schemes.\nAll things cannot perturb his mind—\nthus he bears no **overbearing expression**,\nno **arrogant qi**—\nharmonious yet unyielding,\nin perfect accord with all things,\nto fulfill the will of the world,\nfinding no entrance where he does not find contentment.\n\n**Tranquil as if in latent existence**—\nthe heart like cold ashes,\nthe body like withered wood’s branches,\nwithin **serene composure**, the heavenly light shines by itself.\nAwakened yet as if lost and preserved,\nnaturally formless yet divine—\nthis is its Dao, is it not?\n\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit exists before the **Symbol of the Emperor**.\n**Symbol**—the first visible form of things.\n**Emperor**—the divine response to things.\nThings are born, then **Symbol** appears;\nthe **Emperor** emerges, then wonders manifest.\nThe **Symbol of the Emperor** is the origin of all things,\nyet the **Great Dao** precedes it.\nAs **Zhuangzi** said:\n*\"The divine and the ghostly,\nthe divine and the Emperor,\ngenerate heaven and earth.\"*\n\nInvisible to the gaze,\ninaudible to the ear,\nuntouchable to the hand—\nit emerges yet no one sees its gate.\nWho could know it?\nThus I say:\n*\"I do not know whose child it is—\nit exists before the **Symbol of the

dare not name it directly.\n\n**Blunting its sharpness** to **unify with the dust**—\n**Sharpness** is the form of **fire (☵)**;\n**Chaotic** is the form of **silk (纟)**.\n**Blunting the

existing.\nNo one lacks the Dao,\nbut the Sage can preserve it whole.\n\nTo blunt its sharpness, lest it stray into **madness (妄)**.\nTo resolve its confusion, lest it clash with things.\nIf it does not stray into madness,\nnor clash with things,\nthen external calamities are gone,\nand its radiance arises.\n\nYet to follow and harmonize it,\nlest it differ from things.\nRadiance—pure and bright.\nDust—utterly mixed.\nThough dust may seem the same,\nI fear it would abandon all things.\nOnly thus can preservation be complete—\n**Zhen (湛)** then remains in its constant state.\n\nThough

exists,\nno one can ultimately name it,\nyet it cannot be said to be nonexistent.\nHence I say: \"Is this not before the **Emperor**?\"\nThe **Emperor** precedes all,\nyet it precedes even the **Emperor**—\nthen nothing can precede it.\n\n**Lu Jiufu** said:\n*\"The Dao is vast, yet when applied, it seems never full.\nThe Dao is born from **vacuity (冲)**,\nand its use is all there

**vacuity (冲)** and emptiness,\nit can yet nourish all things,\nso it is said to be 'never full.'\n\n**Yuan (渊)**—like the primal source of all things.\nThus, **empty the heart, weaken the

respond, receive, and deepen.\nAll things’ generation and transformation\narise from the Dao—\nnot sudden, yet unfathomable.\nIn its function, it is spoken of as *\"seemingly\"*—\nin its essence, as *\"seemingly the primal source.\"*\n\nTo blunt its sharpness until aligning with dust.\n*Sharpness*—this is the Dao’s acuity.\n*Confusion*—this is the multiplicity of affairs.\nAffairs are confused,\nyet not the Dao that resolves them—\nhow could scattered affairs prevail?\nYet without blunting sharpness,\nconfusion could not be resolved.\nFor excessive sharpness means some things cannot enter—\nlike today’s unraveling knots with a dull awl.\n\n*Radiance*—this is the Dao’s clarity.\n*Dust*—this is the vulgar’s obscurity.\nThe vulgar are obscured,\nyet not the Dao that aligns with them—\nif it makes itself clear,\nthen differing from the vulgar would be exalted—\nwhat reliance on the Dao would remain?\nYet without harmonizing radiance,\none could not align with dust.\nFor excessive clarity means it cannot contain dust.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"When crossing streams with others,\nmy intention is the same.\"*\n\nDeep, yet seemingly present.\nEmpty, thus deep;\ndeep, thus still;\nstill, thus unified.\nEssence and function are present within it.\n*Deep*—this is the form of stillness.\nThe world’s chaos from excessive affairs\nhas no end.\nOnly the Dao can resolve and align,\nsaving the world from its murky depths—\nthus, it may be said to be everywhere,\nyet truly not departing.\n\n*\"Seemingly\"*—\nthis encompasses the two phrases above.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nprior to the august Emperor.\nThe Dao arises from non-being,\nthus the Dao is the child of non-being.\nYet it is said *\"I do not know\"*—\nthe Dao’s limit,\neven Laozi dared not speak directly of its existence.\n\n*Symbol*—the mark of form.\n*Emperor*—the master of generation.\nThough the mother of all things\ndoes not embody its generation,\nyet it embodies the *Symbol of the Emperor*—\nthe Dao arises from non-being,\nand the *Symbol of the Emperor* arises from the Dao.\n\nNon-being is like a father,\nthe Dao is like a child,\nthe *Symbol of the Emperor* is like a grandson.\nZhuangzi said: *\"Prior to the Great Ultimate.\"*\n\nThe previous chapter speaks of governance,\nthus it follows with the Dao’s boundlessness.\n\nLiu Ji says:\n*\"The Dao is boundless in its use, yet its application may not be full,\nuntil prior to the august Emperor.*\nThe Dao is nowhere absent,\nyet nowhere absent in its doing.\nBoundless in its use,\nits function is inexhaustible.\nThough filling heaven and earth,\npervading the six voids,\nit is not seen as full.\nClothing all things without being their master,\nall things return to it, yet it does not know itself as master.\"*\n\nThus, it is the **Root of all things**—\nyet none in the world can know it,\nnone can see it.\n\nDeep and mysterious—\nit is only like this.\n\n*\"Deep\"* means:\nsubtle, wondrous, and fundamentally unified,\nprofound beyond recognition.\n\nThen, those who **enter this Dao** by sitting still,\nhow should they proceed?\nOnly by **dulling the sharp** and **unraveling the tangled**.\n\n**Dulling the sharp** means:\ndulling its piercing edge,\nand with gentle weakness processing oneself—\nthis is knowing *Yang* yet holding *Yin*,\nknowing *white* yet holding *black*.\n\n**Unraveling the tangled** means:\nunraveling its chaos,\nand with emptiness and tranquility dwelling within—\nthis is removing filth and halting thought,\ncalming the mind and guarding the One.\n\nThus, within **Great Tranquility**,\nthe heavenly light shines naturally,\nits luminosity tempered so it does not dazzle itself,\nits dust harmonized so it does not differ from others.\nRefining the **Void’s essence**,\nachieving **Nature’s True Self**,\nserene yet ever still,\nas if both absent and present—\nthus, *\"serene\"* is like something both present and absent,\nseen yet its form is invisible,\nheard yet its sound is unheard.\nNo beginning can be grasped,\nno end can be traced,\nno name can be given to it.\n\nThus, I do not know whose child it is,\nprior to the *Symbol of the Emperor*.\n\nThe *Symbol* is the **beginning of form**,\nthe *Emperor* is the **ancestor of life**—\nthus, it is used as metaphor,\nfor its arising before heaven and earth yet encompassing them.\n\nThus, it follows with heaven and earth.\n\nZhao Shizhen says:\n*\"At first, I doubted only two.\nOne: using harmony as application—\nthe Dao is boundless yet applied without action,\nthus nothing is left ungoverned.\nAnd following with boundless Dao applied—\nthe Dao is not without doing,\nbut rather completes action.\nThough it has action yet shows the function of non-action,\nthis is the Dao’s application.\nAll affairs under heaven value **equanimity and harmony**—\nif one can apply the Dao’s balance,\nthen above, it does not reach **excess**,\nbelow, it does not sink to **extreme lowliness**,\nthis is the Dao of the Emperor’s **Great Balance**.\nThus, governance is shown through action,\nand governance reaching balance and harmony is called **Great Peace**.\nDoes **Great Peace** still have the *Symbol*?\nIt returns to **non-action**.\nYet this chapter first speaks of application,\nthen of subtlety—\nsubtlety is not dared to be directly shown.\nThus, the text speaks of *one* or *two* as if,\n*as if* being the words of doubt;\n*seemingly* being the words of approximation.\nThe Dao is originally formless,\ntruly without fixed essence.\nNow, if it is applied through balance,\nthen the Dao is also shaped by rules and methods.\nIf the Dao follows rules and methods,\nthen it is fixed and unchanging.\nOnce fixed, it cannot universally respond—\nhow then can it be subtle?\nThe Dao moves with **spiritual dynamism**,\nand heaven follows—\nthus, it is only *as if* like this.\n\nThe **Commentary** says:\n*\"Boundless\"* is **balance**.\n**Balance** is the *qi* of **harmony and moderation**.\nIts root is from **One to Two**,\nfrom **Two to Three**—\n**One** is heaven,\n**Two** is earth,\n**Three** is humanity.\nThe *qi* divides from **One** into **Three**,\nclear ascending as *Yang*,\ndark descending as earth—\n*Yin* and *Yang* interact,\nand the **central *qi*** is born.\n\nThe text does not say **balance** but **boundless**—why?\nHeaven is **One** below,\none being the celestial number—\n**One** arises from *Kǎn* (the abyss),\n*Kǎn* being water,\nthe *fontanelle* at the crown,\n*fontanelle* being surrounded by five—\nfive being earth.\nWithin the five *qi*, water and earth are both contained,\nwithin the *fontanelle*, the *cinnabar field* belongs.\nIndeed, five times five is ten,\nten being the **mother of things**,\none being five.\nWithin its essence, there is **faith**,\nthus it is contained in the **primordial head**.\nHeaven five is **balance**,\nyet from water, it has the principle of harmony.\nThus, **boundless** is **balance**,\nthis is called **Great Harmony**.\nThe text says: *\"Within it, there is **essence** (精), **essence** being **One**,\nand within it, there is **faith** (信), **faith** being **Five**.\"*\n\nNow, speaking of **applying balance**—\nthe Dao uses *qi* as its application,\n*qi* in things being **faith**.\n*Qi* is what envelops the **six extremes**.\nToday, heaven and earth, both inside and out,\nare all encompassed by **One *qi***.\nOnce inside and out are encompassed,\nit is full.\nFullness cannot endure,\nthus the **ordained commands** exist.\nThey regulate heaven and earth’s transformations,\nso that nothing is excessive—\nif excessive, then **boundless** is used as application.\nThus, it can be understood.\n\n**Balance** is the **great root of the world**,\n**harmony** is the **universal Dao**.\nTwo: its Dao guards **balance**.\n\nSometimes it seems not full—\nthis is because the Dao has no fixed essence,\nusing essence as essence,\nit cannot be named directly.\nFullness cannot last long.\nUsing **nine** is to know **change**.\nIf it is already balanced without fault,\nthen in *Kǎn* (the abyss),\nit may still seem not full.\nSometimes it seems not full—\nits presence, who can exhaust?\nIts depth, who can fathom?\nHeaven is **One’s nature**—\nits fruit lies in **balance**?\nHeaven five is **One’s fate**—\nits fruit lies far from **One**?\nThus, *\"deep\"* is like the **Root of all things**.\n\nApproximate speculation—\nit cannot even be correctly met.\nThree: **not mastering**, thus constant.\n\n*\"Deep\"* is like the **Root of all things**.\nThe **Void** is the Dao’s essence,\n**obscurity** is the Dao’s hue,\n**depth** is the Dao’s origin,\n**flickering** is the Dao’s application.\n\nWithout essence yet essence—\nvast and minute, all are its essence.\nWithout hue yet hue—\ndark and bright, all are its hue.\nHidden in **depth and void**,\nyet its application is inexhaustible—\nthus it is said, *\"deep is its dwelling\"*.\n\nWho then holds the **true position**?\nAll take the **Void** as essence,\nthe **Void** as hue—\nand yet, who can exhaust its source?\nWho can measure its mystery?\nAll is only *as if*—\nthus it is said, *\"the Dao cannot be named directly\"*.\n\nFollowing, **correctly expounding** the **subtle application**.\n\nOne: **diminishing stillness, obscuring response**.\nDulling its sharpness,\nunraveling its chaos,\nharmonizing its light,\nequalizing its dust—\nthese four are all **human affairs**,\nyet human affairs do not depart from the Dao.\nUsing the Dao in balance to respond to them.\n\nThe **Commentary** says:\n*\"To harmonize all under heaven’s intentions,\nso that none enter without finding their own fulfillment.\"*\n\nNow, these four:\nrespond externally yet apply internally,\nall are matters of **nature’s division**.\n\nDulling its sharpness—\n**One *qi*** generates humanity,\nfilling the four limbs abundantly,\n*qi* within us—\nnone are not fully filled.\n\nIf one does not nourish it with evenness,\nharmonize it with nature,\nthen strife will arise at times—\nwhen it arises, it overflows outward as **excessive rigidity**,\nand excessive rigidity harms things.\nThose who understand this\nwill, when encountering rigidity, naturally restrain themselves.\n\nThus it is said, *\"Dull its sharpness\"*—\n**dulling one’s own sharpness**.\n\n**Unraveling its chaos**—\nAll things fill the space between heaven and earth,\nnone without affairs.\nWhen myriad affairs press upon me,\nI must know them,\nand contain them within **Oneness**,\nthen they will quiet and cease.\nIf I follow them with movement,\nthey will harmonize and flow.\nTo quiet and cease them brings clarity,\nbut to follow and drift drowns one.\nThus, **unraveling chaos** means\n**containing them within Oneness to still them**.\n\n**Harmonizing its light**—\nLight is the scattering of clarity.\nIf inner sincerity does not falter,\nform and strategy manifest as light.\nLight within me,\nlike carrying the sun and moon while walking,\nseeking to overcome others’ light with my own—\nhow could one know that others’ light also illuminates my light?\nBetter to forget oneself in Dao/Way’s art—\nwhat difference is there between you and me?\n\n**Equalizing its dust**—\nHuman life has never lacked distinctions of high and low.\nIf distinctions exist, nearly all will argue.\nIf one does not cling to them,\nnearly all will align.\nThus, **unequal** is the division of high and low,\nwhile **equalizing** is the matter of virtue/nature.\nIn essence, what the **Noble One** aligns in is only nature’s division.\n\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"The Noble One harmonizes yet does not align,\nthe petty aligns yet does not harmonize.\"*\n\n**Two: Embracing emptiness to respond.**\n**Deep and vast, as if it exists.**\n\nWhen things overflow,\nin affairs, it is excess.\nWhen water overflows,\nin vessels, it spills.\nNeither excess nor spilling—\nonly **deep and vast**, and that is all.\n**Deep** is clarity.\nIllustrating the **Dao’s essence**.\n\nThe Dao is not an affair,\nnor is it water.\nTo call it clarity is not clarity,\nto call it obscure is not obscure.\nWhen it is sensed, it communicates—\n**as if it exists**, yet only seems so.\n\n**Later clarity, without beginning.**\n**One: Manifesting without a master.**\nI do not know whose child it is,\nemerging from the **Great Emptiness**.\nThe **Great Emptiness** has no name—\nwhose father could it be?\n\n**Two: Independent and profound darkness.**\n**Embodying the Sovereign before all.**\nThis chapter first speaks of application,\nthen of subtlety—\nthus, subtlety is revealed through application.\nWhen subtlety is revealed,\nit lies in *\"I do not know whose child it is,\"*\n**embodying the Sovereign before all.**\n\nThe **Commentary** says:\n*\"Embodiment is the first appearance of things,\nthe Sovereign is the divine response to things.\nWith embodiment and things—\ncould this be the Dao?\nThe preceding text merely initially speaks of application,\nthen of calming the heart,\nuntil ‘not overflowing or seeming to exist,’\nall correctly expounding the Dao’s great essence.\"*\n\n**Not overflowing** is not reaching the limit of numbers to overflow.\n**As if the root of all things**, yet not assuming responsibility for affairs.\n**Deep and vast, as if it exists**—\nbeing and non-being cannot exhaust it.\nThen, embodying the Sovereign cannot precede it,\nwhose child it is cannot be known.\n\n**Shao Ruo Yu** says:\n*\"The Dao is boundless in its application,\nas if it does not overflow until it embodies the Sovereign before all.\"*\n\nThe **Great Dao** with boundless *qi* transforms into **One Qi**.\n**One Qi** divides into yin and yang.\nYin and yang generate transformation,\nreceiving **One Qi** as their master—\nthus knowing that **One Qi** dwells within yin and yang,\nhence it is called **boundless qi**.\n\nThe **Great Dao** applies boundless *qi*—\nlike heaven covering, earth bearing,\nthe sun shining, the moon attending,\nwinter’s cold, summer’s heat,\nspring’s birth, autumn’s gathering—\nall are the application of boundless *qi*.\nBoundless *qi* is **present yet formless,\nabsent yet precise**,\nbetween heaven and earth—\nneither overflowing nor deficient.\n\n**Deep and vast, as if the root of all things**—\nThose who study seek boundless *qi*:\nthey must dull their heart’s sharpness.\nWhen sharpness ceases, the will rests,\nthus able to unravel affairs’ chaos.\nWith a tranquil will and few desires,\none harmonizes light;\nwithout contending with things,\none equalizes dust.\nWith neither inner nor outer defilement,\n**deep and vast**—\nonly a **single heart** remains.\nThough its traces are unseen,\n**as if it exists**.\n\nThe **Buddhist School** likens it to a bright lamp and moon,\n**alchemists** call it the **Great Elixir, Golden Pill**,\n**Mencius** called it **浩然之气**—\nspeaking of the utmost greatness and rigidity,\nnurtured upright without harm,\nfilling heaven and earth—\nthis *qi* aligns with virtue and the Dao.\n\n**Laozi** points to *\"deep and vast, as if it exists\"*—\nthis is the **One Qi** transformed by the **Great Dao**.\n*\"I do not know whose child it is\"*—\nthis embodies the **Sovereign of all things** before yin and yang.\n\n**Wang Zhi Ran** says:\n*\"The Dao is boundless in its application,\nas if it does not overflow until it embodies the Sovereign before all.\"*\n\nHeaven and earth are vast,\nall things are numerous—\nthe **One Qi** of all under heaven,\nwhere is it not the Dao?\nHumans dwell within their domain,\nreceiving the proper yin and yang,\nboundless, harmonious, yielding, and compliant—\nthis is **humanity’s middle**,\nborn with heaven and earth,\nsharing substance with all things.\nIf one applies it with balance,\nit is called **the Middle Dao**;\nif one attains its constancy,\nit is called **the Constant Dao**.\n\n**Boundless** is **middle**—\nneither excess nor deficiency,\nalways within the appropriate measure,\nboundless, expansive, and limitless,\npouring in yet never full,\ndrawing yet never exhausted,\nupright in the divisions of **ren** and **yi**,\npenetrating the essence of nature and life.\n\nThe ignorant do not know,\nthus **Laozi** repeatedly emphasizes this,\nwhile scholars often fear losing their way.\n\n**Nurturing nature correctly**—\nwhen still, it shares virtue with yin;\nwhen moving, it shares waves with yang.\nSometimes dispersing, sometimes differing,\nsometimes gathering, sometimes ceasing—\neven in speech and silence,\naffairs must have a master,\nwords must have a root.\n**Root** is the root of this,\n**application** is the application of this.\n\nMoreover, the Dao generates all things,\nyet the Dao never departs from things,\nthings never depart from the Dao.\nLike rivers differing yet all returning to the sea,\nor myriad teachings differing yet all returning to the Dao.\n\nThe Dao as a thing—\nonly **dim and indistinct**,\nconstantly dwelling between being and non-being,\ncannot be pointed to in definite terms,\nthus it is said: *\"Deep and vast, as if the root of all things.\"*\n\n「Some say it is deep yet seems as if it might exist,\nits use is like the unfilled—this is the nature of it.\n\nTo blunt its sharpness, to untangle its confusion,\nZhuangzi said: *\"The sage dwells among things without harming them,\nand things cannot harm the sage.*\nThe sharp—if it has this, it need not be blunted,\nfor what sharpness remains?\nThe sage empties himself to wander in the world,\nserene yet boundless,\nall beauties follow him,\nyet he does not engage with things,\ndissolving like ice melting away.\nThe confused—if it has this, it need not be untangled,\nfor what confusion remains?\"\nAh! The scholars of old and those of today\nhave differing words.\n\nThe ancient **Perfect Ones** (*zhìrén*) do not pursue profit,\ndo not abandon harm,\ndo not boast of prominence,\ndo not lament obscurity,\ndo not hoard judgments of right/wrong or good/evil.\nInternally upright, they follow Heaven’s **Dao** (*Tian’s Way*),\nexternally adaptable, they follow humanity’s **Dao**.\nFilled yet luminous, they shine without dazzling,\nnever uttering abrupt or extravagant claims.\nThe so-called \"shining\" is not without harmony,\nthe so-called \"dusty\" is not without unity—\nhow could they strive to force harmony and uniformity?\nJust as Liezi dwelled in Zheng for forty years,\nand no one recognized him,\nthe king and ministers, nobles and officials,\nregarded him no differently than the common folk.\nLaozi spoke of neighboring lands where\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs could be heard,\nyet the people lived and died without ever visiting one another.\nThis may truly be called dwelling in ease and following the natural order,\nfinding their proper place.\n\nNow, there are things that blend into unity,\nborn before Heaven and Earth,\nsilent and vast,\nself-sufficient and unchanging.\nLaozi said of himself: *\"I do not know whose child I am,\nI am before the **Archetypal Sovereign** (*Xiàngdì*).\"*\nThe formless form, the symbol without substance—\nthis is the **Archetypal Sovereign** (*Shén Dì*) as the first emperor,\nthe **Dao** before any beginning.\n*\"I do not know myself\"*—then who can I say I am?\nThis is not the **Dao**’s own origin,\nyet how could it be otherwise?\nScholars should know what comes first and what follows,\nstriving earnestly to seek it out.\n\nHuang Maocai said: *\"The **Dao** is boundless, and its application reaches before the **Archetypal Sovereign**.\nYin and yang together are called **Dao**.\nBoundless is the harmony of yin and yang’s **qi**.\nIts use is like the unfilled—\nempty, yet able to respond.\nDeep, like the root of all things,\nstillness can encompass all existence.\nTo blunt its sharpness—\nnot to compete with things.\nTo untangle its confusion—\neach has its own order, yet nothing is disordered.\nTo harmonize its light—\nto conceal it within oneself.\nTo blend with the dust—\nto merge with the common.\nDeep yet seems as if it might exist—\nconstantly existing yet never destroyed.\n‘I do not know whose child I am, before the **Archetypal Sovereign**’—\nthis is the **Dao**.\nThe **Dao** originally has no name,\nsome call it the **Transforming Artificer** (*Huàgōng*),\nsome call it the **Creator** (*Zàowù*),\nsome call it before the **Archetypal Sovereign**—\nall are forced names.\"*\n\nCheng Tai said: *\"The **Dao** is boundless, and its application reaches to the root of all things.\nBoundless is the opposite of full—\nhumble yet boundless, youthful yet boundless, vast yet boundless,\n**harmonizing qi** is boundless—\nall mean not to be extreme in fullness.\nZhuangzi likened the **Dao** to filling Heaven and Earth.\nIf it is both filling and full,\nthen its fullness is manifest.\nFullness is the **Dao**’s presence in all things.\nSince fullness is honored,\nyet boundless is also honored,\nthe more one uses the **Dao**,\nthe more one should be thus.\nLike saying ‘knowing the male while guarding the female,\nknowing the white while dwelling in the black’—\nthis is having both the male and female\nyet resting in the female,\nhaving both the white and black\nyet dwelling in the black.\nThis is to be boundless in fullness,\nseeking emptiness in the midst of it.\nThus it is called **boundless application** (*chōngyòng*).\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Carve and polish to return to simplicity,\ndo not be a **nominal sage** (*míngshī*)—\na name without substance,\ndo not be a **scheming strategist** (*móufǔ*)—\na mind without purpose,\ndo not be a **taskmaster** (*shìrèn*)—\na role without responsibility,\ndo not be a **master of knowledge** (*zhīzhǔ*)—\na scholar without true understanding.\nTo exhaust what Heaven bestows\nyet show no trace of gain—\nthis is also emptiness.\nHeaven’s single nature can fully possess all things,\nyet it seems as if it has never gained anything—\nthis is to be boundless in fullness,\nseeking to reach emptiness.\nThus, the **scheming strategist**,\nthe **taskmaster**,\nthe **master of knowledge**—\nthose who tread in its traces yet are truly substantial,\nare indeed those who\nhave no inability yet never willingly probe to the end.\nIs this not blaming fullness\nand seeking emptiness instead?\nAll things under Heaven are born from existence,\nexistence from non-existence—\nthus non-existence is the root of all things.\nOnce one has applied the **Dao**,\nit emerges as **virtue** (*dé*),\nand **virtue** divides into\n**ren** (*仁*), **yi** (*义*), and **li** (*礼*).\nHow then can one rightly call it non-existence?\nIf one cannot contain non-existence,\nthen one should seek its nearest likeness—\nonly boundless can approach it.\n‘The unfilled’—\nthis is not truly lacking,\nmerely doubt.\n‘Seems as if it might exist’—\nthis is not daring to assert a definite claim.\nThe unfilled—\nit is not yet able to swiftly reach non-existence,\nthus it only seems like it.\nThis is all speaking of the **Dao**’s presence in humanity,\nmatching it to the **Dao** itself.\n\nTo blunt its sharpness, to untangle its confusion.\nSharpness—\nthe outward form of talent and wisdom,\nwith thorns and angles.\nConfusion—\nthe details of affairs,\nentangled and complex.\nThis is what Zhuangzi called the **sticky and agitated** (*jiāojiāo rǎorǎo*).\nTo blunt its sharpness—\nto be thick and solid without exposure,\nto untangle its confusion—\nto be simple yet not disjointed.\nTo harmonize its light—\ngood faith fills one’s substance,\nreaching luminosity.\nThe universe is stable and settled—\nemanating from Heaven’s light,\nits depth and brilliance vary,\nyet its radiance is unified within and without.\nIf one embodies the **Dao**’s fullness\nand manifests it in practice,\nthen its light is clear as the sun and moon—\npeople will not be able to approach it at all.\nShining yet not dazzling—\nthis is to seek unity with things.\nZhuangzi expounded the **Original Abode** (*Xuánshě*), rising from his seat,\nand spoke of the light arising from form—\nwas this not also about harmonizing light and setting restraints?\nTo blend with the dust.»\n\n「The dust is neither earth nor mere vapor,\nbut when aligned with worldly affairs,\nits drifting and polluting nature is revealed.\nIf one can harmonize with it,\nthen even whiteness may enter *nirvana*,\nwhile those who expose their nakedness,\nunable to be cleansed,\nare beyond reach.\n\nYet if one adorns wisdom to dazzle the foolish\nor refines the body to reveal impurity,\nit is contrary to this principle.\n\nDeep and tranquil, as if something exists—\nwhen sharpness is blunted and confusion untangled,\nits response to things is natural, yet its function unseen.\nWhen light blends with dust,\nit mingles with the vulgar, unable to distinguish itself.\nAt first glance,\nthe **Dao/Way** seems distant from humanity.\nBut upon closer inspection,\nits tranquil purity without admixture\nshows that the **Dao/Way** is never truly absent.\n\nGreat fullness is like emptiness—\nthis is its proper state.\n\nThe later passages on *守雌* (keeping the female) and *守黑* (keeping the dark)\nall speak of the constant **virtue/power** that is never lost—\nthis aligns with the present discussion.\n\nWhen it says *\"seems\"* and *\"as if,\"*\nit refers to what people cannot fully grasp.\n\nIf one gazes and is startled by its keen discernment,\nquick wit, and agility,\nit is merely talent and intelligence—\nnot the **Dao/Way**.\n\nI do not know whose offspring it is,\nnor whether it precedes the *Xiàngdì* (August Sovereign).\nThe **Dao/Way**’s essence is nonexistent—\ntruly the mother of Heaven and Earth,\nyet Zhuangzi expands it, saying *\"shén guǐ shén dì shēng tiān shēng dì\"* (the divine spirits, divine sovereigns give birth to Heaven and Earth),\nso the **Dao/Way** must indeed have existed before the August Sovereign.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nand this is called the mother of the world.\nHaving obtained its mother to know its offspring,\nall things that arise from the **Dao/Way**\nare its children.\n\nThis passage discusses the **Dao/Way**’s application,\nsummarizing the original and the nonexistent from the previous chapter,\nand extending it to humanity.\nIf a person embodies the **Dao/Way** and can\nmake it empty so it does not overflow,\nand obscure so it seems as if something exists,\nthen what they contain is nearly nonexistent.\n\nIf one is a person,\nI do not know who could be its child.\nApproximating its equal rank,\nit might even precede the August Sovereign.\nTo speak deeply of **virtue/power** and align with the **Dao/Way**,\nthe world will find none who can surpass it.\nTo grasp its utmost excellence,\none might even precede the August Sovereign.\n\nDiscussing those who act in the world,\ntheir affliction lies in their sharpness and swiftness\nnot being able to keep pace with events.\nYet the teachings of Laozi suppress and conceal,\nfearing any exposure,\nso their self-conduct is gentle, weak,\nfeminine, dark,\nhumble, lowly, and solitary—\nunwilling to receive blame,\nto take the lead, or to dare to act first.\nThis is not merely about\nresponding to events with non-interference—\nthere is a deeper principle.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** originates from nonexistence,\nyet those who follow the **Dao/Way** all engage with existence.\nIf they dwell in existence and act in existence,\nit is like using oil to wash oil—\nonly adding more filth,\nwith no way to attain purity.\nThus, one must root in nonexistence to govern existence,\nand seek to eliminate existence to approach nonexistence.\n\nPracticing with gentleness and resting in emptiness,\nthough not yet fully nonexistent,\nis near to it.\n\nWhen it says *\"obtaining the mother to know the child,\"*\nand then *\"knowing the child while still guarding the mother,\"*\nthere is good reason for this.\n\nFrom nonexistence, one observes existence,\nand through existence, one comprehends nonexistence—\nthe inner and outer are always in accord.\n\nIt also says:\n*\"The weak are the **Dao/Way**’s application—*\nthe world’s myriad things are born from existence,\nexistence from nonexistence.\nThis is why the weak replace the strong,\nknowing that existence must return to nonexistence.\"\n\nThe first chapter establishes the dual names of *有* (existence) and *无* (nonexistence),\nsummarizing the essence of the great **Dao/Way**.\nThis chapter contrasts *冲* (emptiness) and *盈* (fullness),\nsummarizing the practice of the **Dao/Way**.\nIf a person embodies the **Dao/Way** and reaches this point,\nthen Heaven and Earth cannot claim them as their children,\nand entering from nonexistence to the original,\nfrom the original to the wondrous,\nthere is nothing unattainable.\n\nZhān Qiūpǔ said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** is empty, yet its application reaches before the August Sovereign.\nThe chapter on 'no source' states that the **Dao/Way** uses emptiness and subtlety,\nso as not to overflow or be excessive,\nbut to be profound and hidden, nurturing all things as their sovereign root.\nIt must blunt its sharpness to become simple and unadorned,\nuntangle its confusion to become orderly,\nthen it can harmonize and illuminate,\nmix with the dust of the world,\nand this **Dao/Way**, profound and boundless,\nis without source.\nI do not know where it originates,\nnor whether it precedes the August Sovereign’s authority—\nhow could one encounter it without seeing its beginning?\"*\n\nZhāng Chōngyìng replied:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** is empty, yet its application reaches before the August Sovereign.\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the **Dao/Way**,\nand the **Dao/Way** follows natural spontaneity.\nThe **Dao/Way** of natural spontaneity flows without interruption,\nleaving no trace or form—\nits emptiness is boundless,\nits application ceaseless.\nIn spring, it is harmonious;\nin summer, it is warm;\nin autumn, it is clear;\nin winter, it is frozen—\nyet the yang nourishes and the yin distributes,\nwithout any partiality or excess.\nHumans, confined in their blood-flesh bodies,\nendowed with yin-yang *qi*,\nreach upward to Heaven,\nwalk downward on Earth,\nand within hold natural spontaneity.\nIf one can empty this **Dao/Way** and apply it,\nleading to no overflow or loss,\nthen the **Dao/Way** is profound and subtle,\nand the body unifies with Heaven and Earth.\nHow could the myriad things fail to take it as their root?\nThus, when ambition is sharp,\none must retreat to blunt it—\nlest Jiè Tuī perish in fire,\nor Chú Nǚ die for a tree.\nWhen affairs are chaotic,\none must simplify to resolve them—\nlest the Six States be provoked to attack Qin,\nor Jian Li die for a bright reputation.\n\nTo harmonize its light—\nnot relying on one’s own brilliance\nto extinguish others’ brilliance,\none should be like the sun and moon shining together\nwithout any loss of clarity.\nTo blend with the dust—\nnot relying on one’s own purity\nto defame others’ purity,\none should be like pearls and jade falling into mud\nwithout risk of harm or suspicion,\nthen this mind is deep and tranquil,\nclear and without residue,\nunaffected by chaos,\nand the **Dao/Way** remains constant within it.\n\nThus, aligning with Heaven and Earth to enjoy longevity—\nyet I do not know whose offspring it is,\npreceding Heaven and Earth in establishing the **Dao/Way**,\nand so embodying the August Sovereign’s authority before them.\"*\n\nZhāng Língyìng said:\n*\"Boldness and sharpness are the root of harmful *qi*;\nchaos and excess are the source of lost essence.\"*\n\n「To rely on one’s own brilliance is to risk injuring one’s spirit;\nto be arrogant risks damaging one’s body.\nThose who wish to learn the **Dao/Way** must be cautious here—\nwhen encountering sharpness, they must blunt it,\nwhen encountering chaos, they must dissolve it,\nblending their light with that of others,\nmerging their dust with the common dust,\nthen the *qi* will not be harmful,\nthe essence will not be lost,\nthe spirit will not be injured,\nand the body will not be damaged,\nthus fulfilling the hope of longevity.\n\nThe *Dexing* [\"Classic of Virtue\"] in the chapter \"Mysterious Virtue\" again cites these four principles,\nfor those who seek to attain the realm of **Dao/Way** with virtue\nmust also heed these warnings.\n\nBái Yùchán said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** is vast yet finds application—\nsometimes appearing insufficient.\nWithin emptiness, it is profound.\nLike the source of all things, it is the mind itself.\nBlunt its sharpness, gather the spirit.\nDissolve its chaos, still the thoughts.\nBlend its light, conceal the mind within the mind so it is unseen.\nMerge its dust, blend the mind with the myriad things.\nDeep and tranquil, it seems to exist—\npreserving the spirit in the formless.\nI do not know—\nwhose offspring it is,\nembodying the August Sovereign’s authority before them.\"*\n\nLiáo Cuìrán then replied:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** is vast yet finds application—\nits *qi* is originally boundless and unrestrained,\nyet it is without form to serve its purpose.\nSometimes it seems insufficient.\nProfound, it is like

face?\nThis is ultimately called what?\n\nThe Supreme Way’s natural roots run deep—\nimmovable, where is it not honored?\nChen Bìxū said:\n*\"The Dao/Way is vast yet finds application—\nsometimes it seems insufficient.\nVast (*chōng*), it is empty (*xū*), yet also central (*zhōng*).\nSometimes (*hù*), an undefined term—\nalso meaning constant (*cháng*).\nIt speaks of the Dao/Way using vastness and emptiness as its application.\n\nFor the *qi* of harmony is vast and empty,\nthus it serves as the Dao/Way’s application.\nThe Sage attains the use of vast emptiness,\nso the myriad chariots abandon their wealth.\nThe commoner attains the use of vast emptiness,\nso the humble dwelling forgets its poverty.\nThough seated in halls of power,\ntheir mind is as still as those in mountain caves,\ntheir body clad in coarse rags,\nyet they do not differ from the adorned.\nThis is the profound attainment of vast emptiness,\nyet it is never full or overflowing.\n\nYán Jūnping said:\n*\"To

the true attainment of the Dao’s vast and harmonious use,\nyet it is never full or overflowing.\nCentral (*zhōng*), it means the application lies in harmony—\nthe Dao/Way, or perhaps, one who dares

vast emptiness,\nneither lacking nor overflowing,\nits nature congealed and deep beyond measure,\nthus it is called *yuān* (deep).\nThe logic of the unfathomable—\nneither existence nor non-existence,\nhard to name definitively,\nthus it is spoken of as if it were.\n\nIn daily life, it permeates all things,\npouring forth as boundless clarity,\nembracing all phenomena,\nguarding against harm and evil,\nboth motion and growth returning to it—\nthus it is the source of all things.\nTo blunt its sharpness—\nto suppress and curb its forward thrust,\nits keen ambition for fame and gain.\nTo dissolve its chaos—\nwhen thoughts rage and entangle,\ninner and outer turmoil,\nthose who embody the Dao’s deep stillness\nrelease its bonds, dissolve its chaos,\ndeep and clear, returning to its original nature.\nChaos (*fēn*), in the *River Master’s* text, is *fèn* (anger),\na knot of resentment.\nIt speaks of hidden malice and wrath,\nanger and resentment tightly bound—\nif one harbors the Dao’s vast harmony,\nthen all dissolves like ice in spring.\n\nTo blend its light—\ndeep and still, it seems to linger yet persist.\nThe Dao of utmost emptiness,\nusing vast harmony as its application,\nits effects boundless yet never seen as full—\nthus it never appears as overflowing.\nThe Dao’s measure is profound depth,\ncontaining all things without distinction,\nvast and minute, high and low—\nall are embraced within.\nThus it is called the source of all things.\nAll things reverence the Dao.\n\nTo blunt its sharpness—\nsuppressing its outward edges,\nno rigid angles.\nTo dissolve its chaos—\nremoving inner entanglements,\nno clinging disturbances.\nTo blend its light—\npenetrating both surface and core.\nTo blend with its dust—\nmerging with the common world.\nDeep and tranquil, vast and boundless—\nthe Dao lies here.\nVisible yet unseen,\nheard yet unheard—\nthus it is said to linger yet persist.\nI do not know whose child it is,\nyet it precedes the Sovereign’s likeness.\n\nThe Dao is within heaven and earth,\nyet heaven and earth follow this Dao.\nThe Dao is within all things,\nyet all things are born from this Dao.\nBeyond the sky and soil,\nback to the ancient beginning—\nwho can know the Dao’s origin?\nThis is unknowable.\nYet in metaphor, it precedes the Heavenly Sovereign.\n\nIt has been said:\nThere is the *beginning* (*shǐ*),\nthe *unbeginning* yet beginning (*wèishǐ yǒu shǐ*),\nand the *unbeginning* yet *unbeginning* (*wèishǐ yǒu wèishǐ*).\nIn the ancient chaos,\ndim and indistinct,\nthe Sage named it *Great Ease* (*Tàiyì*), vast and boundless,\nflowing endlessly without end.\nThen it was called *Great Initial* (*Tàichū*), the womb of confusion,\nwhere presence and absence merge.\nThen it was called *Great Commencement* (*Tàishǐ*), where sensation reveals itself,\nsometimes existing, sometimes vanishing.\nThen it was called *Great Purity* (*Tàisù*), neither turbid nor clear,\nneither yin nor yang.\n\nOnly when reaching *Great Polarity* (*Tàijí*)\ndoes it contain the Three as One,\nall things’ original nature,\nnone lacking.\nFrom this point onward,\ngeneration endures without exhaustion.\nYet all are born from the Dao,\nnot able to birth the Dao.\nOne can be the Dao’s father,\nyet cannot be its child.\nOne can be the Dao’s lord,\nyet cannot be its subject.\nThus, the Dao truly has no origin—\nwhere does it come from?」\n\n「The Dao acts according to its own nature—\nif birth is the Dao, then who else could it be?\nThus I say: *Before the beginning was the beginning* (*Wèi shǐ yǒu fú wèi shǐ yǒu shǐ zhě yě*).\n\nLin Yongzhi’s *Chang* states:\n*The Dao is boundless yet its function reaches to the form before the Sovereign’s creation.*\nBoundless (*chōng*) means emptiness (*xū*). Though the Dao’s essence is empty,\nits function is inexhaustible—\nsometimes overflowing, sometimes not,\nadapting to the times without fixed measure.\n\nNot saying “overflowing” or “not overflowing,”\nbut “sometimes overflowing, sometimes not,”\nthe very word *sometimes* reveals its meaning.\n\nThis is the art of language.\nDeep (*yuān*) is beauty.\n*Seem* (*sì*) is the use of ambiguous words to praise.\n\nThe root of all things (*wàn wù zhī zōng*)\nis the *Great Master* (*Dà zōngshī*) as Zhuangzi speaks of it.\nThis Dao is sometimes present, sometimes absent—\nif one does not understand the Dao,\nthey cannot know why it is called *the root of all things*.\n\n*Dull its sharpness* (*cuò qí ruì*)—\nits edges are worn smooth without any angles.\n\n*Unravel its chaos* (*jiě qí fēn*)—\nit remains orderly even amid confusion.\n\n*Shine without revealing* (*guāng ér bù lù*), hence *harmonize its light* (*hé qí guāng*).\n*Without dust yet not self-cleansing* (*wú chén ér bù zì jié*), hence *equalize its dust* (*tóng qí chén*).\n\n*Profoundly subtle and faint* (*zhàn rán wēi máng*), yet unseen—\nsometimes existing, sometimes vanishing,\nseemingly present yet seemingly absent,\nhence *profoundly, like existence* (*zhàn yī sì ruò cún*).\n\nThis is the *dim and indistinct* (*huǎng yī huò*).\nWithin it, there is substance.\n\nI do not know whose child it is—\nanother ambiguous phrase to praise its mystery.\n\n*Form* (*xiàng*) means *seem*.\n*Sovereign* (*dì*) is *Heaven*.\nIt is said to exist before the Sovereign’s creation,\nfor its essence is empty yet its function boundless.\n\nThe words *form* and *seem* both describe\nwhat is visible yet invisible,\nknowable yet unknowable,\nusing such language to depict its marvel.\n\nFan Yingyuan says:\n*The Dao is boundless yet its function reaches to the root of all things.*\nBoundless (*chōng*) means emptiness (*xū*) and harmony (*hé*).\nDeep (*yuān*) is profound.\n*Seem* (*sì*) is because the Dao cannot be pointed to or named.\n\nIts function is empty yet pervasive,\nsometimes seemingly not overflowing—\nfor it is formless.\nYet profoundly deep, unfathomable,\nit seems like the ancestral lord of all things.\n\n*Dull its sharpness* until *profoundly, like existence*—\nif one can use the Dao to blunt the edge of emotions and desires,\nto unravel the chaos of affairs,\nto refine the heart like a mirror without flashing its brilliance,\nto blend with the dust of the world without staining its truth,\nthen the Dao is always *profoundly, like existence*—\nsometimes appearing as if present.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nnor does it resemble the Sovereign’s creation.\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*It exists before the Sovereign’s creation*—\nwhose child is this thing?\n\nXiu Xiu’an states:\n*The Dao is boundless yet its function sometimes seems not to overflow*—\nits function is poured into yet never full,\nmeasured yet never exhausted.\n*Profoundly, like the root of all things*—\nthe Dao’s essence is profound and still,\nthough it is the root of all things,\nall things do not know how they are rooted in it,\nhence *like the root*.\n\n*Dull its sharpness* until *equalize its dust*—\nthose who embody the Dao blunt their sharp edges,\nunravel their chaos,\nharmonize their light without dazzling,\nequalize their dust without obscuring.\n*Profoundly, like existence*—\nprofoundly existing beyond all things yet not flowing,\nas Zhuangzi says: *It nourishes things yet is not ensnared by them.*\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nnor does it resemble the Sovereign’s creation.\n\nBefore the Five *Taos* (*wǔ tài*), whose child was it?\nThe Sovereign’s lord?\n\nChu Berniu’s *Bìxiū* states:\n*The Dao is boundless yet its function sometimes seems not to overflow*—\nthe Dao gives birth to gods and spirits,\nto the Sovereign and Heaven,\nto Earth and all things,\nyet it cannot be sought through form or named through words.\nEmpty yet moving,\nit is nowhere absent,\nthus it can govern all under Heaven,\nrespond to all sensations,\nseemingly filling Heaven and Earth yet never truly full.\n\nThe Dao contains the *Original Qi* (*yuán qì*) yet is unseen,\nyet its signs already exist within it—\nthe principles of giving birth to Heaven and Earth\noriginate from the utmost emptiness.\n\nIts use depends on humanity—\nit weaves through all transformations,\nand only when one attains the realm of utter emptiness\ncan they employ this Dao.\nWith no fixed form or measure,\nhow could it ever overflow?\n\n*Profoundly* (*yuān*), deep and still,\nits divine brilliance emerges,\nall transformations arise.\nThings are born from existence (*yǒu*),\nexistence from non-existence (*wú*),\nand its root is non-existence.\n\nOnce it emerges to become things,\nit is only seemingly distinct from non-existence.\n\nOrdinary people cling to traces of existence,\nencountering obstacles at every turn.\nTeaching them to blunt their sharpness prevents harm to things,\nto unravel chaos preserves their selfhood,\nto harmonize light without standing out,\nto equalize dust without being swept away—\nthen *profoundly, like existence* can be seen.\n\nThough seen clearly and believed firmly,\none does not know whence this thing was born,\nnor whose child it is.\n\nThe Sovereign’s ruler is called *Heaven* (*dì*).\nThis thing seems to dwell even before the Sovereign,\nexalted yet beyond exaltation—\nnothing further to exalt.\n\nIn this chapter, there are ten sentences,\nyet five use ambiguous words.\nSome debate whether the Sage, upon seeing the Dao,\ncould penetrate its principles so clearly—\nwhy speak of the Dao with so many ambiguities?\n\nFixed form means fixed name,\nwords have definite referents when examined thoroughly.\nOnce the Dao is named and called *Great*,\nit cannot be commanded,\nnor can it be pointed to and defined.\nThis is why it is said to be beyond naming.」\n\n「If one clings rigidly to things in a single corner without allowing for transformation and flow,\nthen, as Zhuangzi says, it is *awakened yet as if lost and existing*—\n*unformed yet spiritually manifest*, all things gathered yet unknown whence.\n\nThe Sage and Worthies speak of the Dao in this manner,\nnot from reluctance to speak, but because at this point words are insufficient.\n\nLet the scholar delve deeply to grasp its clarity,\nas one awakens from drunkenness—\nthe Sage’s teachings, earnest and unhidden, reveal themselves to you.\n\nThe *Mysteries of the Cow* say:\n*The Dao is vast yet in use seems not to overflow.*\n\n*Vast* means *central*—\nthe Dao’s essence contains all creation,\nnurturing and giving birth to Heaven and Earth,\ngenerating the Four Great Elements to precede them,\nencompassing all dharmas yet standing alone supreme.\n\nThe Dao’s application is indeed great,\nyet it is called *vast* because it does not indulge in self-satisfaction.\nThus, when we consider the meaning of *not overflowing*,\nis it not fitting?\n\nThe *Taoist Sovereign* speaks of this to encourage humility and centrality,\nand there is also the principle that *non-satisfaction naturally leads to overflowing.*\n\nIn the time of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors,\nthere was a vessel called the *Yòu Zhī* (Graceful Cup)\nused for admonition.\nWhen Confucius saw it, he instructed his disciples to fill it with water—\nwhen upright, it held; when full, it tipped over.\n\nConfucius sighed and said:\n*\"Good! This is the way of those who hold fullness.\"*\n\nThe ancients, wise and clear-sighted, took this as the highest warning,\noften placing it beside their seats.\n\nDoes this not illustrate the Dao’s application in *centrality*?\n*Profound yet like the ancestral source of all things.*\n\nThe ancestral source of all things is the Dao—\nfor the Dao gives birth to Heaven,\nHeaven to Earth,\nand Earth to all things,\nthus it is called the ancestral source.\n\nThe Dao is the progenitor and ancestor of all things,\ntruly the most exalted.\n\nYet it is called *like* the ancestral source,\nbecause it does not claim self-exaltation—\nthis is the language of humility.\n\nThis lesson teaches the world:\nif one always practices humility and centrality,\nthen one naturally avoids *highness leading to peril.*\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"He who has greatness yet knows how to be humble will surely have good fortune.\"*\nThis is the case.\n\nThus the virtuous person, hearing much,\n*restrains himself yet holds fast to it*;\nwith many aspirations,\n*refines his nature yet conceals it*;\nwith profound understanding,\n*simplifies his actions yet executes them with precision*.\nHence, when he stands above others, all revere him;\nwhen he leads, none dare to harm him.\n\nTherefore, the world willingly follows him without tiring—\nwhy is this so?\n\nIt is because of his *humility and centrality.*\n\n**Dulling the sharp.**\n*Dulling* means *restraining*.\n*Sharp* refers to *the cutting edges of speech and action*—\nwhen a person’s *qi* is sharp,\nsometimes it erupts from within,\nmanifesting in words—\nthe world calls this *lip-spears and tongue-swords*,\nand at times it wounds others more than actual blades.\n\nThus the good and virtuous person,\nhow could he not tolerate all?\nIf he constantly reflects inward,\ndulling his sharpness and restraining his *qi*,\nthen he will not recklessly harm others.\n\nThis is the meaning of *dulling the sharp.*\n\n**Untangling the tumult.**\n*Tumult* refers to *the clashing of conflicting emotions*.\n*Untangling* means *self-discipline*.\nWhen two joys arise, there will be many exaggerated praises;\nwhen two angers arise, there will be many exaggerated reproaches.\nIf the *qi* of discontent surges within,\nthen exaggerated reproaches will burst forth,\nand the two clash in resistance—\nthis is called *tumult and competition*.\n\nThus the great and virtuous person,\nconstantly restraining his discontent and checking his desires,\ndoes not fall into contention and rivalry.\n\n**Harmonizing his brilliance.**\n*Brilliance* refers to *cleverness and innate talent*.\n*Harmonizing* means *concealing and dimming*.\nTo *conceal* is to prevent cleverness from being displayed;\nto *dull* is to prevent innate talent from being revealed.\nConfucius, the greatest Sage,\nin his native village appeared as if *without words*—\nYanzi, the greatest Worthies,\nthroughout the day spoke not, as if foolish.\n\nThese are all examples of *harmonizing his brilliance*.\n\nI have heard from the ancients:\n*\"I am clever—what does cleverness avail me?\"*\n*\"I am virtuous and capable—what do virtue and capability avail me?\"*\nIf one boasts and relies upon them,\nthen one has already become small.\n\nI only lower my *qi* to humility and harmony,\nalign my heart with uprightness and restraint,\nsubmit my spirit to solemnity and reverence,\nso that even the common folk can consult me,\nand the ministers and great officials are all those I honor.\nYet I do not know that I am exalted,\nand they do not know that they are low.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"The virtuous person, when he presides over the people,\nconceals his brilliance yet makes it clear—*\nthis is the case.\"\n\n**Equalizing the dust.**\n*Dust* refers to *obscurity and vulgarity*.\n*Equalizing* means *treating all with equal benevolence*—\nto *equalize benevolence* is to have no division between *darkness in others* and *clarity in oneself*;\nto *view uniformly* is to have no distinction between *foolishness here* and *virtue there*.\n\nIn general, the Way of being a person\nvalues *lowliness as the foundation*,\n*humility as the base*—\nthus the great and virtuous person,\nconstantly concealing his brilliance and yielding to the vulgar,\ndulling his traces and blending with the dust,\nknows that the world cannot be elevated,\nso he descends;\nknows that the people cannot be surpassed,\nso he follows behind.\nWith warmth, respect, and careful virtue,\nhe makes others admire him;\nby adopting the receptive and holding low,\nnone can surpass him.\nInternally, he hides his wisdom and does not display his skills—\nthough I am exalted and high,\nothers do not harm me.\nThough the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers flow to the left,\nthey are longer than all other streams,\nbecause they can humble themselves.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"By lowering the noble and elevating the humble,\none gains the people’s loyalty.\"*\nIs this not the meaning of *harmonizing his brilliance* and *equalizing the dust*?\n\n**Profound yet like existence.**\n*Profound*—\nthis speaks of *non-existence* and *existence*,\nof *having* and *being*—\nthe Dao’s essence seems *non-existent* yet *existing*,\n*present* yet *as if lost*,\nthus it is said: *profound yet like existence.*\n\nThis is why the ancients, wise and clear-sighted,\nunderstood the Dao’s *having* and *non-having*—\nconstantly *dulling the sharp*, *untangling the tumult*,\n*harmonizing their brilliance*, and *equalizing the dust*.\n\nThen, what is the meaning of *embodying the Dao*?\nThe Dao’s teachings—\nits essence is boundless,\nits application infinite,\nits nature inherent in all things,\nneither lacking nor deficient.\nIt is obtained in human life at the beginning of *stillness*,\nmanifested in response at the moment of *natural flow*,\nnurtured in the *unaroused emotions* of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight,\nand realized when *intent and form* are both *non-existent*—\n*serene yet correct*,\n*profound yet clear*,\n*dim yet vast as the Great Emptiness without dust*,\n*flickering yet ordered as the four seasons*—\n*non-action yet all things are done.*」\n\nThis is the teaching of *serene yet seemingly existent*—\nI do not know whose child the Dao is, before the Emperor’s reign.\n\n*\"I\"*—this is Laozi’s self-designation.\n*\"Whose\"*—no name can be ascribed.\n*\"Child\"*—refers to the Dao.\n*\"Like\"*—as in *resembling*.\n*\"Emperor\"*—human sovereign.\n\nJust as the forms of Heaven, Earth, and myriad things,\ntheir coming into being has its own origin—\nwhen one speaks of mother and child,\nonly the single character *Dao* is naturally void and boundless,\nits birth having no source—\nthus, the Sage of Highest Clarity rightly says,\n*\"I do not know whose child the Dao is.\"*\n\nFor the Dao’s meaning,\nwhen pushed to the limits of the unheard and unseen,\nits subtlest aspect is difficult to name;\nwhen concealed in the scentless, soundless Heaven,\nits utmost essence is difficult to know.\nTrace it forward—no beginning is seen to converge,\ndraw it backward—no end is seen to depart.\nWho could know whose child the Dao is?\n\n*\"Like the Emperor before his reign\"*—\nLaozi once served as the Emperor’s teacher;\nancient Emperors once asked Laozi:\n*\"Of whom is the Dao the child?\"*\nThe Sage of Highest Clarity thus said,\n*\"Like the Emperor before his sovereignty—*\nwhat form, what appearance was it?\"\n\nYang Zhiren says:\n*\"The Dao’s subtlety in its application is like the Emperor before his reign.\"*\nThe Dao’s subtlety in its application—\nvigorous yet pure, empty yet not filled—\nis thus the abyss of all things.\nHumans may walk it:\ndulling the sharp, untangling the tangled,\nharmonizing within and yielding without,\naligning with waves and flowing with currents,\nconcentrating the mind internally,\nletting the primordial *qi* surge and harmonize above and below,\nsubduing the restless monkey-mind from straying,\nembodying nature’s serene stillness,\ntrue and constant, unmoved—\nhaving yet not having, real yet seemingly void,\nilluminating inside and out,\nrevealing its own luminous clarity.\n\nI do not know whose child the Dao is,\nbefore the Emperor’s reign.\nThe ancients say: *\"Do you still recognize this?\"*\n\nThe Dao’s essence, neither lost through time nor ancient,\nis plainly visible before one’s eyes.\n\nYu Qingzhong says:\n*\"The Dao’s subtlety in its application is like the Emperor before his reign.\"*\n\nThe Dao is like the sea—\nfor the Dao alone is void and thus receptive,\nwhile the sea alone is vast and thus capacious.\nThe Dao’s essence is inherently void,\nyet its application never strays beyond the subtlety of this emptiness.\n\nThe phrase *\"never filled\"*—\nonly when examined in the context of the following passage does its meaning become clear.\n\nAmong the things between heaven and earth,\nnone is as great as the sea—\nthe Dao is truly like it:\nprofound and deep, wondrous in its capacity.\nRivers and streams pour into it,\nday and night without ceasing,\nyet it never appears to be filled.\nSome say *\"never filled\"*—\npeople often doubt its lack of fullness.\nYet where is its use concealed?\nDoes it not blunt the sharp within the unseen heavens?\nIs this not the dulling of the keen?\n\nDoes it not transcend mundane entanglements\nbeyond the realm of right and wrong?\nIs this not the untangling of the tangled?\n\n*\"Harmonizing its light\"*—\nit does not flaunt its brilliance to dazzle itself;\n*\"aligning with dust\"*—\nit does not compete in purity to turn away from filth.\n\n「湛然」之二字，Yōngzhāi Lín Zhī [1]认为是微茫而不可见的状态，道本无形，在恍惚之间，指真空为实有，故曰似若存。\n\n道超越于器物形象之外。我不知是哪位圣哲之子，却能精妙地体现它。Qīngyuán Liú Jì说：象是有形的开端，帝是生物的本源。有子之字，正下得象字。象，即肖也 [2]。犹如继世象贤之意。\n\nXū

Yuántīshī说：在光同光，在尘同尘。秉文此章首尾，言道挫锐解纷，和光同尘。\n\n「The inferior knowers do not speak of *chapters* [of the Dao]. Those who speak of humans embodying the Dao and achieving absolute dependence on and alignment with its mysterious depths are not merely conforming to the ways of the world.\n\n*The Commentary on the Various Schools* states: *\"The Dao has sentiment and trustworthiness, yet it acts without form or design. It can be transmitted but not clung to*#2*, obtained but not seen. From its own root and origin, before heaven and earth existed, it has endured from antiquity. It encompasses gods and spirits, emperors and lords, giving rise to heaven and earth—yet it does not claim precedence over the Supreme Ultimate (太极), nor does it dwell beneath the Six Extremes (六极) as something profound. It precedes the birth of heaven and earth yet is not deemed ancient, and it surpasses the Upper Antiquity (上古) yet is not considered aged.*\n\nThe Stone Cavern Master (石潭) remarks: *\"The Dao is vast yet when applied may seem insufficient, deep as if it were the ancestral source of all things.*\"\n\n冲 means *emptiness/void*. Emptiness prevents fullness; emptiness without fullness means no manifestation, and no manifestation means profound depth. Hence, it is called *vast and deep*. Though it is said to be unmanifest, it is indeed the ancestral source of all things. The word *seem* (似) implies that the Dao cannot be definitively named.\n\n*Ancestral source* (宗) refers to the primordial origin from which all things arise, affirming that all things emerge from the Dao.\n\nTo *blunt its sharpness* (挫其锐) means to remove its exposed facets; to *dissolve its turbulence* (解其纷) means to disperse external disturbances. To *harmonize its radiance* (和其光) means to conceal its brilliance so it is not seen externally. To *align with the dust* (同其尘) means to blend with the world’s impurities without standing apart. *Luminous yet seemingly present* (湛兮似若存) conveys the Dao’s clarity and enduring presence, though it appears as if it were not always there.\n\nI do not know whose offspring this is—it precedes the Heavenly Sovereign (天帝).\n\nThe Dao is the origin and ancestral source of all things. I do not know whose offspring this Dao itself is, for even the term *ancestral source* (宗) suggests the Dao has its own origin. Yet it is further described as *preceding the Heavenly Sovereign*—where *sovereign* (帝) means the Heavenly Emperor, and *seeming* (象) implies its presence before him. Though named as the mother of all things, it is truly the beginning of heaven and earth. Heaven and earth arise from it, so the Dao precedes the Heavenly Sovereign. This shows that the Dao is not only the ancestral source of all things but also the ancestral source of heaven and earth itself.\n\nThis entire passage speaks of the Dao’s essence, not of those who embody the Dao.\n\n*End of Volume Nine of *The Collected Meanings of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* #1*\n*#1: \"若存若士\" (ruò cún ruò shì) – \"士\" (shì) is likely a scribal error for \"亡\"

one’s essence,\nurging adherence to the central harmony of *zhōnghé* (中和).\n\n*Master Du Guangting’s (杜光庭) Observation:*\nIf one clings to \"virtue\" as virtue, then there is attachment;\nif one does not regard transformation as virtue, then there is no selfishness.\n\nThe sovereign’s gaze upon all living beings\nis like heaven and earth’s regard for all things.\nAll things arise and transform of their own accord—\nheaven and earth do not claim credit for their work.\nThe myriad folk dwell and thrive as they will—\nthe sovereign does not take merit for their sustenance.\nHe relies on the wondrous *qi* to animate and shape,\nand on the mysterious transformation to bring forth life—\nthis is the ultimate transformation.\n\nIf one speaks of their virtue and kindness,\nlogic will itself reach exhaustion.\nWhy?\nThe virtue of heaven and earth is vast—\nyet grasses and trees flourish in summer and wither in winter.\nThe virtue of the sovereign is vast—\nyet laws decree exile and execution.\nSuch virtue is not as great as that which does not cling to virtue as virtue,\nbut instead follows the natural flow and preserves the tranquil stillness—\nthe essential secret for nurturing one’s body.\n\n*Master Zhang Chongying’s (张冲应) Response:*\n\"Emptiness\" means \"voidness.\"\nThe boundless void contains no forms,\nyet between heaven and earth it moves and functions—\nwithout sound or scent,\nyet all things arise from it, endlessly.\nIf humans attune to this emptiness and employ it,\nthen the Dao will achieve nothing it cannot perfect.\n\nHeaven and earth lack virtue,\ntreating all things as fodder and dogs.\nThe sage lacks virtue,\ntreating the people as fodder and dogs.\nBetween heaven and earth,\nis it not like the bellows?\n\nThe bellows is empty within,\nyet produces sound and breath.\nEmpty yet unexhausted,\nmoving yet ever more abundant.\nExcessive speech and action lead to depletion—\nbetter to guard the central harmony.\n\n*Variant in Transmission:*\n\"Empty yet ever more abundant\" (虚而愈出) is also rendered as \"empty yet abundantly yields\" (虚而俞出).\n\n*River Above Master’s (河上公) Explanation:*\nHeaven and earth lack virtue—\nthey bestow life and transformation without sentiment,\nacting purely by nature’s course.\nThey treat all things as fodder and dogs—\nfor though heaven and earth produce all beings,\nhumans are the most precious.\nYet they regard them as mere grasses and beasts,\ndemanding no repayment in return.\n\nThe sage lacks virtue—\nthe sage nourishes the people without sentiment,\nfollowing heaven and earth’s example,\nacting by nature’s course.\nHe treats the people as fodder and dogs—\nthe sage regards them like grasses and beasts,\ndemanding no gratitude or reverence.\n\nBetween heaven and earth—\nthe space between heaven and earth is empty and tranquil,\nand harmonious *qi* flows through it,\nso all things arise spontaneously.\nIf humans eliminate desires and emotions,\nmoderate tastes and pleasures,\npurify the five viscera,\nthen the spirit will dwell within them.\n\nLike the bellows—\nthe bellows is hollow within,\nyet produces sound and breath when moved.\nEmpty yet unexhausted,\nmoving yet ever more abundant—\nit speaks of an emptiness that cannot be depleted,\nand movement that never ceases to yield sound and breath.\n\nExcessive speech leads to depletion—\nexcessive action harms the spirit,\nexcessive speech harms the body.\nWhen the tongue moves and words multiply,\ndisaster and calamity follow.\nBetter to guard the central harmony—\nbetter to cultivate virtue within,\nnourishing the spirit,\ntreating *qi* as precious,\nand speaking sparingly.\n\n*Master Wang Fusi’s (王辅嗣) Interpretation:*\nHeaven and earth lack virtue,\ntreating all things as fodder and dogs—\nfor they act by nature alone,\nwithout contrivance or design.\nAll things regulate themselves naturally,\nso heaven and earth do not interfere.\n\nIf one clings to virtue, they must contrive and impose transformations,\nentertaining thoughts and actions.\nContrived transformations cause things to lose their authenticity,\nand deliberate actions prevent their natural completion.\nIf things cannot complete naturally,\nthen they cannot fully sustain life.\n\nThe earth does not cultivate fodder for beasts,\nyet beasts eat fodder;\nthe earth does not breed dogs for humans,\nyet humans eat dogs.\nWithout action toward all things,\nyet all things find their proper place,\nand their use is never wanting.\n\nIf kindness stems from one’s own contrivance,\nit is insufficient and unreliable.\n\nThe sage lacks virtue,\ntreating the people as fodder and dogs—\nfor the sage aligns with heaven and earth’s virtue,\ncomparing the people to fodder and dogs.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe movement is boundless yet ever more abundant.\nWithin the bellows,\nthe emptiness is void of desires and actions,\nso it cannot be exhausted or depleted,\nand its movement is never spent.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe natural flow is boundless,\njust as the bellows—\nexcessive speech leads to depletion,\nyet guarding the central harmony prevents exhaustion.\nThe more one acts,\nthe more one loses.\nTo establish harm in things,\nand to misplace words in actions,\nis to invite inevitable depletion.\nIf one guards the bellows’ central harmony,\nthen there is no exhaustion,\nand if one abandons self to follow things,\nthen all will be in order.\n\nIf the bellows had intent to produce sound,\nit would fail to meet the demands of those who blow it.\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong’s (唐明皇) Commentary:*\nFrom \"Heaven and earth lack virtue\" to \"the people as fodder and dogs\"—\n\"lacking virtue\" means they do not perform acts of virtue and kindness.\n\"Fodder and dogs\" refers to the ritual practice of binding straw into dog shapes for sacrifice.\n\nDogs are kept for guarding and defense,\nso their owners expect loyalty and vigilance in return.\nBut the sacrificial dogs are mere forms,\nwithout the capacity to bark or protect—\nso their virtue is not as profound as that of the living.\n\nIt is said that heaven and earth regard humans\nas humans regard sacrificial dogs—\nwithout expectation or demand.\n\nI have examined this further:\nThe ultimate virtue knows no partiality—\nwho then embodies universal love?\nIf love is partial,\nit is not ultimate—\nit is merely selfish favor.\n\nIf one does not love only their own kin,\nthen all under heaven are kin.\nIf one does not treat only their own children as children,\nthen all under heaven are children.\n\nThus, ultimate virtue is not partial—\nit is the most inclusive.\nHow could it be universal love?\n\n*Commentary:*\n\"Virtue\" here is the natural expression of universal love.\n\"Fodder and dogs\" refers to the ritual practice of binding straw into dog shapes for sacrifice.\n\nToday, heaven and earth’s ultimate virtue\nmanifests in the creation and sustenance of all beings—\nlike humans binding straw into dog shapes,\nthey do not expect the dogs to bark or guard,\nnor do they regard their creation as an act of virtue or kindness.\nHence, it is said they lack virtue.\n\nThe Sage abides in *yòu* (indulgence/forgiveness),\nand thus views all under heaven’s people likewise.\n\n*Commentary:*\nThe \"priceless favor of a worn mat\" (*bìgài zhī ēn*)—\nConfucius said in the *Records of Rites*:\n*\"A worn mat is not discarded—it is for burying a dog.\"*\n\n*\"Not only loving one’s own kin\"*—\nthis is the text of *The Rites of Zhou*.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nit is like the *tuó* and *yuè*—\n*Tuó* is the *tāo* (leather bag),\n*Yuè* is the *dí* (reed pipe).\nWhen the bag is struck to fan the wind,\nand the pipe is played to direct the breath,\nboth rely on emptiness and no-mind,\nthus they move and yet have response.\n\nTherefore, the utmost things between heaven and earth,\nbeing without private favor,\nare also because of emptiness and no-mind.\n\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoved yet ever more forth.\nThe *tuó* and *yuè* are empty yet unyielding—\nwhen plucked, they emit sound and breath ever more,\nillustrating how the Sage’s heart, without partial love,\nhas no time of yielding or obstruction,\nits applications endless—\ntruly moved yet ever more forth.\n\n*Commentary:*\n*Tuó* is *tāo*—a leather bag used to fan wind to kindle fire.\n*Yuè* is the *dí* (reed pipe).\nIt says that heaven and earth create all beings like straw dogs,\nfor their space is empty,\nthus they generate without private favor and without expectation,\njust as the *tuó* fans wind and the *dí* directs breath.\nThose who constantly seek response\nfind no emotion in me.\n\nThus, when emptied, there is no yielding or obstruction,\nwhen moved, sound and breath emerge ever more—\nillustrating how a ruler, with an empty and silent heart,\npurely harmonizing and uniformly transforming,\nhas no yielding or obstruction,\never in daily use, yet unknown—\nmoved yet ever more forth.\n\nMany words lead to exhaustion;\nbetter to hold the Center.\nMany words do not bear fruit,\nthus they exhaust and bend,\nwhile universal love is hard to extend,\nleading to resentment and hatred—\nthus it is better to embrace and guard the Middle Way,\nand all will naturally suffice.\n\n*Commentary:*\n\"Many words\" refers to excessive talk of universal love.\nExcessive talk of universal love,\nyet in practice it cannot be fully extended,\nthus it exhausts and bends without fulfillment—\nthis shows why it is better to forget concerns and respond emptily,\nembracing and guarding the Middle Way,\nso that all will naturally align.\n\n\"Not bearing fruit\" means\n*chóu* (answer)—\nspeaking without action in return.\n\nDu Guangting said:\n*\"Heaven and earth’s lack of virtue makes all under heaven like straw dogs.\"*\n\nAncient sacrificial rites included figures for use,\nmodeled after their forms,\nplaced among the ritual vessels—\nthus the setting of straw dogs.\nDogs bark and guard,\nyet straw dogs serve no such purpose.\nHeaven and earth’s view of all things,\nthe Sage’s view of the people,\nis like that of straw dogs—\nthey do not demand barking or guarding,\nnor do they regard creation as virtue or kindness,\nnor do they expect repayment.\nIf their virtue is not displayed,\nthen it is said they lack virtue.\n\nHumans toward dogs have the favor of a worn mat and burial,\nyet toward straw dogs, there is no such favor—\nthis clearly shows the Sage does not consider universal love as virtue.\n\n*\"Worn mat\"*—\nthe *Records of Rites* [missing character] *Tán Gōng* says:\nWhen Confucius’ dog died,\nhe had Zigong bury it.\nThe Master said:\n*\"I have heard—\na worn mat is not discarded—\nit is for burying a horse.\nA prince’s carriage horse, when dead, is buried with a mat,\nand a worn mat is not discarded—\nit is for burying a dog.\nI am poor, with no mat,\nso at its burial, I gave it a mat instead,\nso its head would not sink into the earth.\nI feared its head would lie straight in the soil.\"*\n\n*\"Not only loving one’s own kin\"*—\nthe text of *The Rites of Zhou* says:\n*\"When the Great Dao prevails,\nall under heaven is public—\nnot only loving one’s own kin,\nnot only regarding one’s own children as children.\nIt is universal love for all things,\npushing toward the public and acting impartially,\nnot indulging in partial love.\"*\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe utmost movement is ever more forth.\n\n「The *tú* is a leather bag that beats the wind,\nthe *yuè* is a bamboo pipe that guides the *qi*.\nThe *tú* beats the wind without the *yuè* to guide it—\nthe *yuè* guides the *qi* without the *tú* to beat it.\nBoth must rely on each other in their operation,\nas heaven and earth rely on the *tú*,\nand the five *qi* on the *yuè*.\nThey hold emptiness and movement within themselves\nto give birth to all the myriad transformations,\nyet never falter or exhaust themselves.\n\nA sovereign empties his heart and follows the Dao,\nhis ministers embody his virtue and enact his transformations,\njust as heaven and earth move the five *qi* without exhaustion—\nthen governance knows no obstruction,\nand the four seas enjoy peace.\nThe more it moves, the more its sound and *qi* emerge,\nits words endless.\n\nWhen the *qi* are pure and transformations uniform,\nthe virtue of purity and harmony pervades all things.\nIf one does not know of its daily use—\n*The Book of Changes* [□ *Xì* *Yǐnyǔ*] says:\n*\"The myriad regions and common folk,\nrely on the use of this Dao to obtain life,\nyet do not know of the Dao’s functional power,\nso they do not regard function as function—\nthe common folk use it without knowing.\"*\n\n*Qū* is exhaustion,\n*náo* is disorder.\nExcessive words lead to depletion,\nexcessive affairs lead to harm—\nexcessive words, when they fail to respond,\nbring exhaustion and obstruction.\nGovernance through excessive words means\nfrequent issuance of decrees,\nmorning orders and evening reversals—\nthis is called depletion.\n\nExcessive words in governing oneself—\nits faults are clear.\nThus, one lost word cannot be recalled,\nlet alone many lost words—\nhow could there be no disgrace?\n\nThe spoken word departs from the firm and clings to the disparate,\nturning white into black.\nTo guard against words is as crucial as to guard against rivers—\none must be cautious indeed.\n\nBetter to remain silent and guard the central harmony—\nfor the state, this does not exhaust its governance,\nfor oneself, this does not invite disgrace.\nLoving the *qi* and sparing words,\nholding virtue within,\npracticing instruction without speech—\nthis is true excellence.\n\nThe *Sòng Dàojūn* said:\n*\"Heaven and earth do not transform until the common folk become fodder and dogs.*\nFavor arises from harm,\nharm arises from favor.\nIf one calls benevolence ‘favor,’\nthen harm follows inevitably.\nHeaven and earth’s regard for all things,\nthe sage’s regard for the common folk—\nthey assist in their natural course,\nwithout the heart of partial love or gain.\nBenevolence cannot be named in this way.\n\nBinding fodder to make a dog,\nused in sacrifices,\nonce its purpose is fulfilled, it is discarded—\npassersby trample its head and body,\nwoodcutters burn its limbs.\nHeaven and earth’s regard for all things,\nwhen spring brings birth and summer growth—\nif they have benevolence and love,\nit extends to autumn and winter,\nwhen all things wither and fall—\nthis is not heaven and earth’s lack of love,\nbut the natural order of things.\nThe sage does not act with partial benevolence,\ntreating the common folk as fodder and dogs.\nIndeed, the sage extends righteousness and benevolence to all under heaven—\nif his benevolence reaches the affairs of men,\nthere are sequences of beginning and end,\nchanges of life and death—\nthis too is the natural order of things.\nThis is not loving first and enduring later,\nbut the natural unfolding of principle.\nThus, it is said:\n‘Not benevolent’—\nyet this is the ultimate benevolence.\n\n*Zhuāngzi* said:\n*\"The Perfect Man has no kin,\nthe Great Man is not benevolent.\"*\nThis aligns with the above.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe utmost movement is ever more forth.\nThe Dao has no form,\nno fixed direction—\nwith the *qi* of boundless harmony,\nit beats and moves between heaven and earth,\nnurturing all things,\nlike the *tú* and *yuè* being empty yet unobstructed,\nmoving yet ever more forth.\nExcessive words lead to depletion—\nbetter to guard the central harmony.\n\nWhen words are spoken, they have form and direction—\ngrand speech is how the Dao is clarified.\nWords imply intent,\nintent cannot avoid error—\nthus, excessive words lead to depletion,\nand it is better to guard the central harmony\nto respond to all changes.\n\n*Sū Yǐngbīn* said:\n*\"Heaven and earth are not benevolent until the common folk become fodder and dogs.*\nHeaven and earth have no partiality,\nbut listen to all things’ natural course—\nthus, all things arise and perish of their own accord.\nDeath is not my doing to harm them,\nlife is not my doing to bestow benevolence.\nLike binding fodder into a dog for sacrifice,\nonce the ritual is complete, it is cast aside—\npassersby trample it—\nis this hatred?\nIt is merely the natural unfolding of time.\nAfter the sacrifice, it is discarded,\ntrampled upon—\nis this not love?\nIt is also the natural unfolding of time.\nThe sage’s regard for the people is the same.\nIf he does not harm them,\nthe people preserve their nature,\nlife and death, gain and loss—\nI have no part in it.\nThough I have not acted with benevolence,\nmy benevolence is grand indeed.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe utmost movement is ever more forth.»\n\nThe bellows and the key—\nwhen their movement reaches,\nnothing resists its sway.\nThe unknowing praise their craft as supreme,\nyet what purpose do bellows and keys serve?\nThey are empty yet unyielding,\nthus their motion ever overflows.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\ntheir birth and death of all things,\ntheir carving of myriad punishments—\nsuch is their way alone.\n\nMuch speech exhausts itself,\nyet nothing surpasses abiding in the Center.\n\nSeeing motion overflow,\nthey fail to grasp it as the response of the Void-Center.\n\nThus I tell them:\nMuch speech exhausts itself,\nyet nothing surpasses abiding in the Center’s boundlessness.\n\nLü Jiufu said:\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent,\ntreating all things as sacrificial dogs.\nThe Dao of Heaven is obscure before the Formless Sovereign,\nyet who knows its origin?\nThen how can one who embodies this Dao be called benevolent?\n\nThe heart—\nmerely human heart—\nyet heaven and earth embody this Dao,\nneeding no benevolence,\ntreating all things as sacrificial dogs.\n\nThe full meaning of \"sacrificial dog\":\nits purpose in ritual.\nReceived, it serves without use,\nyet cannot be omitted.\n\nLike heaven and earth toward things—\nno intent toward them,\nyet seemingly no love,\nyet in spring’s birth and summer’s growth,\nit seems there is love.\n\nThe sage toward the people—\nthus it is also.\n\nThe sage is not benevolent,\ntreating the people as sacrificial dogs.\nThe sage embodies this Dao,\nneeding no contention over benevolence,\ntreating the people as sacrificial dogs.\n\nThe sacrificial dog—\na thing contended over for no benevolence,\nyet kept.\n\nAll things share substance with heaven and earth,\nthe people share substance with the sage.\nHeaven and earth, the sage—\nviewing themselves as sacrificial dogs,\nthus their regard for all things and the people is so.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nmotion ever overflows.\nYet in nurturing, raising, growing, and fostering—\nwhat need for benevolence?\n\nOnly the not-benevolent\nis called great benevolence.\n\nThus between heaven and earth,\nits principle of bellows and keys\nis clearly seen.\n\nThe bellows and the key—\nonly because they are empty yet unyielding,\ntheir motion ever overflows.\n\nMuch speech exhausts itself,\nyet nothing surpasses abiding in the Center.\n\nThus the person who embodies this Dao—\nspeech arises from non-speech,\nspeech without speech,\nknowing how speech speaks.\n\nThus much speech exhausts itself,\nyet abiding in the Center is the true endeavor.\n\nLü Nóngshī said:\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent,\ntreating all things as sacrificial dogs.\nHeaven and earth toward all things,\nthe sage toward the people—\ncalm and unattached,\nyet not clinging to benevolence,\nusing them as fitting,\ndiscarding them when past—\nthus it is said:\nThe sacrificial dog—\nbefore its use, adorned in wicker baskets,\ncovered in embroidered cloth;\nafter its use,\npassersby trample its head,\nwoodcutters burn its body.\nThis is what is meant by:\nusing them as fitting,\ndiscarding them when past.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nmotion ever overflows.\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent,\ntreating all things as sacrificial dogs.\nThe sage is not benevolent,\ntreating the people as sacrificial dogs.\nMoving with the world,\ndrifting with the times,\nyet not bound to past traces,\nnor entangled in what has been trodden—\nthus able to sound when entered,\nfall silent when not,\nand know the bellows and keys.\n\nThus it is said:\nBetween heaven and earth,\nis it not like the bellows and keys?\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever overflowing,\nmuch speech exhausts itself,\nyet nothing surpasses abiding in the Center.\n\nEmpty yet without yielding—\nno place to yield.\nMoving yet ever overflowing—\nsomething to demonstrate.\nWithout yielding yet with demonstration—\nthis is the numinous.\n\nEmpty, without yielding,\nmoving yet with demonstration—\nthus able to respond to things’ impulses,\nspeaking as such,\nyet never exhausted.\n\nAs for reciting ancient soil-mounds,\ndiscussing the former kings’ sacrificial dogs,\nyielding to past traces,\nclinging to what has been trodden—\nseeking to act in the age of decline,\nthis is why much speech exhausts itself,\nyet abiding in the Center is ever more so.\n\nThis entire passage\naligns broadly with Zhuangzi’s intent on sacrificial dogs.\n\nWang Yuanzé said:\nHeaven and earth are not sevenfold,\ntreating all things as sacrificial dogs.\nThe sacrificial dog—\nused in ritual,\nwhen in use, solemn rites and respect are paid.\nWhen the ritual ends,\nit is cast aside and trampled,\nequal to filth—\nyet in the time of solemn rites and respect,\nit was not without sincerity.\nYet it was merely bound fodder shaped as a dog—\nwhat was there truly to revere?\n\nThough unworthy of reverence yet revered—\nthis was not falsehood.\nAll things each attain their due,\nlife and death returning to the soil,\nnature’s course is as it must be.\nYet heaven and earth alone are their parents,\nso they cannot but love.\nYet probing heaven and earth’s intent—\nwhat attachments remain?\n\nThus in their time of love,\nthough with utmost sincerity,\nall things proceed naturally,\ntruly nothing to love.\nYet at their end,\nall return to the same dust—\nwhere is the lingering affection?\n\nThe sage is not sevenfold,\ntreating the people as sacrificial dogs.\nBenevolence—\nhuman benevolence.\nTo love things with human virtue is benevolence,\nyet those who bear human form yet are of Heaven—\nhow can they be named so?\n\nThus the sage loves the near and benevolences the people,\nhence speaks only of the people—\nyet their Dao is one with heaven and earth.\nYet bearing human form,\ntheir responsibilities differ.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nmotion ever overflows.\nThe bellows and keys—\nempty, responding to things,\nimpulsed, then responding,\nresponding yet not hoarding.\n\nHeaven and earth toward all things,\nthe sage toward the people—\nresponding as it must,\nyet no attachment to the moment,\nno lingering on the past,\nthus the bellows and keys’ boundlessness.\n\nEmpty yet unyielding—\nemptiness of substance.\nMoving yet ever overflowing—\nmovement of function.\n\nExcessive speech often leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to hold fast to the Center.\n\nWithout speech, one is exhausted;\nwith speech, one becomes known.\nYet the sage’s work is to speak yet not act.\n\nHolding fast to the Center\nis how one responds to all transformations.\n\nLiu Zhongping said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are not benevolent,\nthey treat all things as straw dogs.*\n\n*Sevenfold compassion—\nthis is how love is brought to fruition.*\n*As for straw dogs—\nif one shows compassion to govern love, it is acceptable,\nbut if one shows no compassion yet still brings love to fruition, it is also acceptable.*\n\n*When they are at their height,\nwoven in baskets, adorned with silk embroidery,\nthe priests and attendants observe strict rites,\nthen carry them forth—\nas if showing compassion to govern love.\nBut when their backs are trampled by passersby,\nwhen they are burned by woodcutters,\nand they are discarded, scattered, and reduced to dust—\nthen there is no longer compassion to govern love.*\n\n*Heaven and Earth are thus as well.*\n*When thunder and wind stir,\nwhen dew and rain nourish,\ncovering, embracing, nurturing,\ngiving life to those who would live,\nfulfilling those who would grow,\nso that all with form stand firm,\nall with nature are completed—\nas if showing compassion to bring love to

likewise.*\n\n*When he moves them with grace,\ndisturbs them with teaching,\nwhen grace overflows and kindness flows,\nwhen the people respond with warmth and labor,\nwith sighs and murmurs—\nas if nurturing an infant,\nas if showing compassion to bring love to fruition.*\n\n*But when crimes are great, they are killed;\nwhen crimes are small, they are punished—\nlimbs severed, bodies torn,\ndragged, stoned, burned, abandoned,\nleft sprawled in the marketplace,\nscattered across the wilderness,\nwhile walled cities weep with severed ears,\nand the capital flows with blood—\nthen there is no compassion to govern love.*\n\n*Thus it is said:\nThe sage is not benevolent,\nhe treats the people as straw dogs.*\n\n*Between heaven and earth,\nmotion ever overflows.*\n*Because they hold no attachment to love or its absence,\nthis is how Heaven and Earth attain their numinous power.*\n\n*The numinous has what it demonstrates,\nyet nothing to constrain it—\nbecause it is unconstrained,\nit is like the bellows and keys:\nempty yet unyielding.*\n*Because it has what it perceives,\nits non-action becomes clear.*\n\n*Manifested in the body as speech,\nseen in affairs as principle—\nsometimes spoken, sometimes acted,\nyet in essence, one and the same.*\n\n*Why so?*\n*Speech is its substance—\nnothing more.*\n*To fail to know this*\n*is to let speech not emerge from non-speech.*\n*If speech does not emerge from non-speech,*\n*it diverges from the bellows and keys’ empty motion.*\n\n*Thus its excess leads to exhaustion—\nhow could it be otherwise?*\n\n*Confucius said:*\n*\"Who now sings these songs?*\n*To know this is to know speech emerges from non-speech.\"*\n\n*Speech emerges from non-speech—\nno one escapes this.*\n*Yet those who cannot*\n*are those whose hearts cling to having rather than non-having,*\n*to taking rather than letting go,*\n*and thus fail to align with the Dao.*\n\n*Neither having nor non-having,*\n*neither taking nor letting go—*\n*yet aligning with the Dao—*\n*this is called holding fast to the Center.*\n\n*Holding fast to the Center without ceasing,*\n*it moves like the bellows and keys, ever overflowing.*\n*Thus it is said:*\n*Between heaven and earth,*\n*is it not like the bellows and keys?*\n\n*Empty yet unyielding,*\n*moving yet ever overflowing—*\n*this is how the sage models Heaven and Earth.*\n\n*Excessive speech often leads to exhaustion—*\n*better to hold fast to the Center.*\n\n*Speech is how one responds to things.*\n*Indeed, modeling Heaven and Earth,*\n*the sage emerges—*\n*inevitably responding to things with speech.*\n*Yet if speech is excessive,*\n*it fails to conform to principle and stop.*\n*If it fails to conform to principle and stop,*\n*it cannot be extended and put into practice.*\n\n*Only by holding fast to the Center*\n*does one’s speech neither multiply nor diminish,*\n*always conforming to principle and stopping.*\n*Thus it can be extended and put into practice,*\n*and exhaustion will not often befall it.*\n\n*Hence it is said:*\n*Excessive speech often leads to exhaustion—*\n*better to hold fast to the Center.*\n\n*Those who hold fast to the Center*\n*speak neither excessively nor sparingly.*\n*Yet why does Laozi so vehemently oppose excessive speech?*\n\n*He clarifies the Dao—*\n*The Dao is ever without speech,*\n*yet ever with speech,*\n*for the Dao cannot help itself.*\n*Thus it can be spoken of,*\n*because it is ever without speech.*\n*The fewer the words,*\n*the closer one is to the Dao.*\n*The more the words,*\n*the farther one strays from the Dao.*\n*Hence his vehement opposition to excessive speech.*\n\n*Liu Jujie said:*\n*\"The sage is not benevolent,*\n*he treats the people as straw dogs.*\n*Nothing is more cruel than war and punishment,*\n*yet even the most virtuous cannot abolish them—*\n*only follow their logic.*\n\n*Sometimes speaking of all things,*\n*sometimes of the people—*\n*each has its proper

emptiness,*\n*yet speak not at all.*\n*The sage also responds to the people with emptiness,*\n*yet when waves of disturbance arise,*\n*it is not speech that sustains them—*\n*only that excess is avoided.*\n\n*The Classic of Changes says:*\n*\"Excessive speech leads to exhaustion.\"*\n*The Center’s substance is one—*\n*worthy of being held fast to.*\n*The Center’s function is empty—*\n*capable of response,*\n*just as Heaven and Earth are called intervals.*\n\nThe *New Sayings of the Chancellor* states:\nThe sage is not virtuous/ren,\nyet treats the people as grass-dogs.*\n\nThe stillness is unsoiled,\nthe purity is unstained,\nyet their sacrifices suffice to honor ritual.\nYet the reverence of the grass-dog—\nat its beginning, when it is to be used,\nit is adorned with embroidered patterns,\nstored in ornate cases.\nOnce used, the travelers tread upon its head,\nthe woodcutters cook its body,\nyet it does not cling to what it loves,\nnor does it adhere to what it possesses.\nWhen appropriate, it is employed;\nwhen fitting, it is released—\nwhen excessive, it is discarded,\nwhen seasonable, it is followed.\nYet the sage’s virtue/ren,\nhow could it be far from this?\n\nThe Dao of Heaven cannot generate life,\nyet life’s generation belongs to the True Lord,\nand the True Lord never generates.\nThe Dao of Earth cannot transform,\nyet transformation belongs to the True Sovereign,\nand the True Sovereign never transforms—\nthus virtue/ren manifests in all things.\nTherefore, all things within Heaven and Earth,\nin form and sound, color and essence,\nare governed by me,\nyet things cannot be distant.\nWhen life is generated and transformation complete,\nthey enter and are concealed in use—\nthus things have their kinds and groups,\neach clinging or departing as naturally fits,\nyet forgetting their origin in me,\nyet things cannot be close.\n\nThough so, Heaven generates but cannot complete,\nEarth completes but cannot govern—\nthe sage emerges to govern it.\nThus, virtue/ren is displayed in form,\nand when it emerges,\nit shares in the calamities of joy and sorrow,\nso all things’ births are aided and sustained,\ntheir proper order never lost—\nvirtue/ren concealed in use.\nWhen it retreats,\neven the sage does not share its cares,\nthus its traces vanish, its heart grows dark,\nand it views things as strange.\n\nAh! The sage’s relation to Heaven and Earth—\nhow could it be weighed down by virtue/ren toward the people and all things?\nThus, when things emerge,\nthe sage emerges with them, unhesitant—\nwhen things retreat,\nthe sage retreats with them, undeterred.\nIt gives birth without possession,\nacts without reliance,\nnurtures without control,\ncompletes without taking credit—\nall things find their due,\nyet some also find regret.\nAnd yet, what Laozi says—\n*\"Heaven and Earth are not virtuous/ren,\ntreating all things as grass-dogs.\"*\n*\"The sage is not virtuous/ren,\ntreating the people as grass-dogs.\"*\nHow could his words be far from this?\n\nLater students cling to narrow virtue/ren,\nforgetting the ancients’ grand Dao—\nthus, in serving others, they fail at universal love,\nin cultivating themselves, they fail at selflessness—\nhow could they know the sage neither loses himself nor others?\n\nShifting with the times,\nturning with all things—\nwithin Heaven and Earth, is it not like the bellows and keys?\nThus, the more it moves, the more it emerges—\nthe upright self, without ego,\nis how the sage responds to things,\nnot by opposing them.\nThe empty, unyielding—\nthe selfless, who lose themselves,\nare how they sever things,\nnot how they perfect them.\n\nAlas! The sage’s Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nof treating the people and all things as grass-dogs,\ncan be exhausted in one phrase.\n\nLiu Ji said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth’s lack of virtue/ren is no greater than holding fast to the Center.\"*\nHeaven and Earth, in their relation to all things,\nthe sage, in his relation to the people,\nfollow their natural course,\nentrust them to their own fate—\nwithout love or gain,\nthus called not virtuous/ren.\nIt is like binding grass to make a dog,\nused in sacrifice—\nwhen fit, it is employed;\nwhen past, it is cast aside—\nno lingering attachment.\nThe empty, awaiting things.\n\nThe Great Emptiness moves with one *qi*,\nmaking Heaven and Earth like the bellows and keys.\nThe bellows—*wǔ* (a leather bag),\nbeaten to kindle fire.\nThe keys—*diào* (a reed pipe),\nblown to produce sound.\nTheir substance is empty yet unyielding,\ntheir function moves yet emerges evermore.\nWhat difference is there from\nHeaven’s motion as yang,\nEarth’s stillness as yin,\nthe ceaseless striking of yin and yang,\nwhile creation unfolds between?\n\nMan’s form follows Heaven and Earth’s symbols,\nhis transformations align with yin and yang—\nlike the bellows and keys as instruments.\nThis speaks of Heaven and Earth,\nyet man is within them.\nHeaven and Earth grasp the marvel of one *qi*,\nand move without ceasing.\nThe sage grasps the marvel of one *qi*,\nand ascends and descends without end.\nIts Dao is vast and distant,\nhard to speak of.\nIf one seeks it in excessive words,\nthen it is mired in ancient dross,\nand spirit is wasted in shallow depths—\nnot merely unprofitable.\nThus, excessive speech leads to exhaustion,\nbetter to hold fast to the Center.\nHolding fast to the Center—\nwithin, it preserves;\nwithout, it does not sway.\nWithout thought, without action,\nserene and unmoving,\nyet it guards the Center,\nlike Heaven and Earth’s bellows and keys—\nwithout heart,\nnaturally moving and functioning,\nfor the True Lord abides within.\nThe True Lord—\nHeaven’s grain, the original spirit.\nThus, it is followed by the spirit of the grain.\nZhao Shi’an said:\n*\"The two precedents—\nFirst, Heaven’s utmost fairness.\"*\n\nHeaven and Earth are not kind,\ntreating all things as sacrificial dogs.\nBlending the singular nature into the Great Unity,\nwho is kind and who is not?\nWith private affection toward things,\nthere arises righteousness and unrighteousness.\nKindness gives birth to righteousness,\nwhile ruthlessness brings death—\nrooted in the natural course of Heaven’s operation.\nWhen favor is bestowed, harm follows,\nseen in the reversals of human affairs.\nThe Classics speak of \"not-kindness,\"\nyet this is the greatest kindness.\nGreat kindness knows no private gain,\nreaching only the utmost fairness.\n\nWhen it is time to give life, life begins—\nthe Yang warmth that first animates things.\nWhen it is time to take life, death comes—\nthe Metal *qi* stern and unyielding.\nTo say that the appointed time for death cannot be delayed\nis to acknowledge the fixed fate of life and death.\nWhen shaken, all things awaken;\nwhen met with harmony, their uses decay—\nthough life is granted, decay soon follows,\nthough death is decreed, life’s intent persists.\nThis is Heaven’s fairness—\nno more, no less.\n\nBut if one kills when it is time to give life,\nor spares when it is time to take it—\nthis is not the public operation of Heaven’s Way,\nbut the private affection of human contrivance.\nTo harm the public with private gain is the upright order of Heaven and Earth;\nto damage the public for private ends is the way of depravity and excess.\nThe Dao acts with fairness,\nhence the saying that Heaven and Earth are not kind,\nyet are likened to sacrificial dogs—\nand thus Heaven’s intent is revealed.\n\nTherefore, the sage’s governance\nembodies Heaven and follows the Dao,\nsevering private kindness and righteousness,\nupholding just rewards and punishments,\nestablishing what is proper—\nwhat need for personal inclination?\nThe commentary states:\n*\"Favor arises from harm, harm from favor.\nKindness as favor—harm follows.\nAll this is to sever private affection.\"*\n\nThus, the sage is not kind,\ntreating the people as sacrificial dogs.\nSo that later sages may align with the Dao,\nresponding to change without obstruction.\nZhuangzi said, *\"Constant kindness never succeeds,\"*\nand again, *\"Do not heap up favors.\"*\nLaozi equated Heaven and Earth’s kindness with the Dao—\nthe Dao is vast, so it knows no private gain,\nand thus transcends the limited kindness of the Five Constants.\nThis intent points to the world’s petty kindness and righteousness.\nOtherwise, why say that excessive speech leads to exhaustion,\nbetter to hold fast to the Center?\n\nThus, the likeness of sacrificial dogs\nillustrates how the sage’s use of \"not-kindness\" is true kindness.\nTo embody the kindness of \"not-kindness\"\nis to embody Heaven and align with the Dao.\n\n**Second Precept:**\nThe sage embodies Heaven.\nThe sage is not kind,\ntreating the people as sacrificial dogs.\nThe sage’s governance of the people\nis without private intent,\nin harmony with Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Second Analogy:**\nOne, drawing from the essence of embodiment.\n\nThe space between Heaven and Earth—\nit is like the *tǔnuò* [leather bellows].*\nThe *Gùzhù* [Commentary] says:\nThe *tǔnuò* receives through its emptiness,\nand responds through its emptiness.\n\nIndeed, the Dao is empty in its essence,\nand void in its function.\nWhen viewed through the Dao’s essence,\nemptiness allows for boundless response;\nwhen viewed through *lǐ* [principle/pattern],\nvoidness enables the measureless flow of *qi*.\n\nThe Dao responds through supreme voidness—\nits origins are unknown;\nThe sage acts without contrivance—\nwho can fathom its purpose?\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nneither above nor below,\nit employs *qi* within,\nlike the *tǔnuò*’s movement.\n\n**Second Analogy:**\nThe function of the *tǔnuò*—\nempty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever issuing forth.\n\nThe *Lǐzǐ* [Analects of Master Li] says:\n\"Why do you esteem emptiness?\"\n\nEmptiness has no worth in itself,\nyet if emptiness is esteemed,\nit becomes obstructed within.\nIf emptiness is merely emptiness,\nit is not a worth to be esteemed.\n\nYet emptiness’s worth lies\nin its ceaseless response—\nviewed through the *tǔnuò*,\nemptiness is thus esteemed.\n\nThough viewed through the *tǔnuò*,\nemptiness is not worth itself.\n\nThe sage acts without contrivance—\nwhen things arise, he responds,\nresponding yet never exhausted.\n\nAll that is fitting yet unerring,\nwe call it *guījǔ* [rule/criterion],\nand thus accord with it as *guījǔ*.\nWe call it *quánhéng* [balance/weights],\nand thus accord with it as *quánhéng*.\n\nWho can name its self-possession?\nEven so,\nwhen governing emperors and kings,\nembodying the Dao is his mind—\nin affairs, he is called \"without contrivance\";\nin things, he is called \"without possession.\"\nHow does this differ from *lǐ* [rites] and *yì* [justice], laws and measures?\n\nYet those who cling to *lǐ* and *yì*, laws and measures,\ndo I not also name them?\nThey name themselves in their own accord—\nI do not bend to such naming.\n\nWhat issues forth yet ever issues more,\nwhat responds yet ever multiplies—\nthis is the supreme principle preserved.\n\nExcessive speech leads to exhaustion,\nbetter to hold fast to the Center.\n\nThis passage, from the Dao’s emptiness as function,\nto the *tǔnuò*’s void response,\nends again with \"Excessive speech leads to exhaustion,\nbetter to hold fast to the Center\"—\ncompared to the previous chapter,\nit still regards speech as the Center.\n\nLaozi likens the *tǔnuò* to the sage’s silence—\nwhen speech is pressed, it moves;\nwhen stirred, it responds—\nbecause he acts without contrivance.\n\nThe *Yì* [Book of Changes] says:\n\"Speech and action are the pivot and hinge of the *jūnzǐ* [noble/gentleman].\"\nThe pivot and hinge’s operation\ndetermines honor and shame.\nYet it is merely fitting and appropriate.\n\nThe Center’s adherence is without fault—\nnot merely without fault but with method.\nConfucius said:\n\"Moderation as *virtue/power* is indeed so—\nthus speech must not be reckless.\"\n\nJūn Píng said:\n\"When words are spoken, calamity enters;\nwhen words are lost, the body perishes.\"\nHán Zǐ said:\n\"Be cautious with water and fire as well.\"\nThe Dao is originally without speech—\nwhen speech is unavoidable,\nresponse must be measured.\n\nIf one desires speech,\nhow can it be avoided?\nThus, thrice he seals his mouth.\nThe sage thus demonstrates his form—\nstudents seek the sage’s intent.\n\nShào Ruòyú said:\n\"Heaven and Earth’s *not-kindness* is supreme,\nyet still not as good as adhering to the Center.\"\n\nHeaven and Earth follow the Dao’s natural course—\nthis is called supreme *kindness*.\nIf not supreme *kindness*,\nthen there is partiality—\nspring’s birth is not *kindness*,\nautumn’s killing is not *not-kindness*.\n\nThe *tǐ* [sacrificial vessels] are discarded when their use is done,\ntreating all things as sacrificial dogs.\n\nThe sage holds *one mind* as *virtue/power*—\nthus he takes the people’s mind as his own.\nRewarding the good is not *kindness*,\npunishing the evil is not *not-kindness*.\n\nFollowing the people’s needs,\nrewarding and punishing according to the times—\nthus the analogy of treating the people as sacrificial dogs.\n\nZhuāngzi said:\n\"Supreme *kindness* knows no partiality,\ngreat *kindness* is *not-kindness*.\"\n\nOnly *not-kindness* is called great *kindness*.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nmeaning the four directions and above and below—\nit is like the *tǔnuò*.\n\nThe *tǔnuò* is hollow within,\nits function lies in the void,\nyet it does not bend.\n\nDiscarding it to inflate the wind,\nusing the *nuò* [valve] to direct the breath—\nmoving yet ever issuing forth,\nlike the opening and closing of *Qiánkūn* [Heaven and Earth].\n\nLaozi prefers \"Excessive speech leads to exhaustion,\nbetter to hold fast to the Center.\"\nThe Center is voidness—\ndwelling in the mind within voidness,\nits function is endless.\n\nWáng Zhìrán said:\n\"Heaven and Earth’s *not-kindness* is supreme,\nyet still not as good as adhering to the Center.\"\n\nThe Great Dao acts without contrivance in Heaven and Earth,\nyet Heaven and Earth depend upon it before they arise.\nHeaven and Earth act without contrivance toward all things,\nyet all things also depend upon it before they stir.\nOnly after Heaven and Earth arise\ndo all things exist—\nand among all things,\nhumans are the most refined,\nyet none fail to receive their natural endowment.\nInitially, there is no mind of love or gain—\nif *kindness* is considered favor,\nis it not too small?\n\nHeaven and Earth have no *emotion*—\nthey regard all things as sacrificial dogs.\nYet Heaven and Earth never demand repayment from all things,\nnor do all things know\nthe favor of Heaven and Earth’s ceaseless generation—\ngreat favor arises naturally.\n\nThe sage has no *emotion*,\nyet he never demands repayment from the people,\nnor do the people know\nthe power of the sovereign’s influence—\ngreat transformation is thus accomplished.\n\nHeaven and Earth toward all things,\nthe sage toward the people—\nyet their natural order is self-formed,\nwhere is room for contrivance?\n\nPursuing without end,\neveryday use unknown—\nwhere is the place for *kindness*?\n\nMoreover, sacrificial dogs,\nthough pure and unsoiled,\nare used in sacrifices—\nwhen their use is at its height,\nthey are like the *táixì* [victim] in the grand temple,\nadorned with embroidered robes,\ntreated with reverence as if divine,\nyet without private favor or demand.\nOnce their use is done,\nthey are equal to dung and soil—\nyet this is not from neglect or abandonment.\nThe haste between use and discarding—\nis this not the sage’s contrivance?\n\nThus, Heaven, Earth, and the sage\nregard themselves as sacrificial dogs—\nthen their view of all things and the people\nis likewise without distinction.\n\nInflating the primordial *qi*,\nstirring all existence—\nlike the *tǔnuò*, like the *nuò*—\npressed, then it moves;\nstirred, then it responds.\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever issuing forth—\nthe analogy is as the Dao’s response to things,\nendless variations without end.\n\nThe interplay of transformations—\nalso like humans’ *emotions*.\n\nThe person expands the Dao/Way,\nnot the Dao/Way expanding the person.\nThe sage’s words are not confined by rhetoric—\nwhen words suffice, the Dao/Way is exhausted in a day;\nwhen words do not suffice, one may speak all day yet exhaust only things.\nEloquent discourse may pierce through,\nsilence embraces supreme truths—\nyet if insight is shallow,\nwords fail to illuminate the Dao/Way,\nthe more one speaks, the further one strays from it.\n\nMust there be a tongue of benevolent grace,\na mouth that pours forth rivers of speech,\nwhen examined by great principle—\nwhat true merit is there?\nBetter to remain silent yet deeply comprehend,\nconstructing wisdom in stillness.\n\nThus it is said:\nNine truths in ten words,\nare not as good as one silence;\nmany words often fail,\nbetter to uphold the central truth.\n\nHuang Maozai remarked:\nHeaven and Earth lack virtue/power until they treat the people as sacrificial dogs.\nHeaven and Earth, toward all things,\ndo no harm—only let them follow their nature.\nThe sage, toward the people,\ndoes no disturbance—only lets them flourish naturally.\nLetting them flourish naturally,\nso the people have no failing to thrive;\nletting them follow their nature,\nso things have no failing to fulfill.\nThis is their virtue/power most profound.\n\nWhen they let things be as they are,\nas if without concern or affection,\nthus Heaven and Earth and the sage are said to lack virtue/power.\nLike the sacrificial dogs—\nusing straw as dogs,\noffered in sacrifice,\ndiscarded once spent—\nwhat concern or affection remains?\nThe doctrines of Shen Buhai and Han Fei\nthus stole this to become the *criminal nomenclature*[*xíngmíng*], most cruel in their severity.\n\nWhen questioned,\nthey say: \"The sage’s governance of the world\nhas no concern or affection.\"\nTheir reasoning stems from this.\n\nHas this not strayed from Laozi’s intent?\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, nothing surpasses the virtue/power of *guard-the-center*[*shǒuzhōng*].\n\nHeaven occupies the upper position, Earth the lower—this all people know.\nThe secret interplay of yin and yang, the hidden shifts of creation—this no one can know.\n\nNow, let us liken it to the *bellies*[*tuó*] and *tubes*[*yuè*]: the Dao of Heaven and Earth is nearly contained in *wuwei*[*non-action*].\n\nEmpty and void in essence, thus it does not bend;\nEver-moving without cessation, thus it ever emerges anew.\n\nLaozi’s Dao has no inner or outer—\nto awaken to the *sacrificial-dog* teaching, one may forget the form and body;\nto grasp the principle of *bellies* and *tubes*, one may refine *jing* and *qi*.\n\nThis should be self-evident without words—\nspeak of it, and one will exhaust its meaning.\nOnly *guard-the-center* attains it.\n\nProgram Tai said: Heaven and Earth are without virtue/power, treating all things as *sacrificial dogs*.\nBinding straw into a dog’s shape—\nwhen used in sacrifice, it is honored; once the rite is done, it is cast aside.\nThis is how things may be noble or base at different times.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate and transform all things,\nyet they cyclically replace one another—\ntruly like the *sacrificial dog*.\n\nWhen rice ripens, wheat withers;\nwhen melons grow, the *qí* plant dies;\nwhen deer shed their antlers, spring and winter reverse.\nGeese and swallows depart as guests—\nsouth and north, they avoid one another.\n\nAmong all creatures, their inherent natures differ vastly—\nthus what suits one may not suit another.\nIf one governs universally,\nand yet harbors a heart of *virtue/power*,\nthen whom shall one favor?\n\nTo benefit one is to harm another,\nto profit one is to neglect a hundred—\nsuch *virtue/power* is laborious and petty.\n\nIf one aligns with the *qi* of things,\nand acts when their roots and natures align,\nthen they arise and transform themselves,\ntake form and color themselves,\nconsume and rest themselves—\nwhile Heaven and Earth seem to take no part in it.\n\nThis is *virtue/power* without *virtue/power*.\nThe sage is without *virtue/power*,\ntreating the people as *sacrificial dogs*.\nThe sage acts without intent,\nyet employs the *Great Rectification* to model Heaven and Earth.\n\nThus, though never curving to love one person,\nno one fails to receive their virtue/power.\n\nZhuangzi extended this, saying:\n*\"The most virtuous has no favorites—*\n*let me forget the world,*\n*and the world will forget me.*\nThis is the *true non-seven*[*zhēngbùqī*] virtue/power.\"\n\nThough its blessings cover all,\nthe world does not know its virtue/power—\nthis is not true forgetting.\n\nHe also said:\n*\"The sage’s love for people—*\n*if you name it for them,*\n*they will not know it as love unless told.\"*\n\nThis too spreads blessings across ages,\nyet the sage does not know it as *virtue/power*.\nThis is called *virtue/power* without *virtue/power*.\n\nIf one selects things to love,\nand extends kindness only to those within one’s favor—\nthis is like a tiger or wolf\nthat does not devour its own young.\n\n*Virtue/power* without *virtue/power*\nis not its true essence.\n\nMencius said:\n*\"Kill them, and they bear no grudge;\nbenefit them, and they do not repay.*\nThe people daily improve and distance themselves from fault,\nyet do not know who acts for them—\nthis is the method of their governance.\nTo say that plowing, digging, play, and leisure\nare not the Emperor’s doing—\nthis is how their effects manifest.\"*\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, movement is endless and ever emerges anew.\n\n*Tuó* means to regulate *yuè*[*leather bellows*];\n*yuè* is its tube.\nIn music, it is the *羽钥*[*yǔyuè*];\nin locks, it is the *管钥*[*guǎnyuè*];\nin foundry tools, it is the *橐钥*[*tuóyuè*];\nyet in essence, it is but one.\n\n*Tuó* is the belly that draws in breath and fills it,\nthen disperses it into the furnace.\n*Yuè* is the tube that receives this breath\nand exhales it to disperse it.\n\nThe pattern of one exhale and one inhale\nis the alternating movement of yin and yang as the four seasons.\n\nThus, between Heaven and Earth,\ncold and heat succeed one another as the four seasons,\nlife and death replace each other as the ages pass—\njust as the *tuóyuè* exhales and inhales.\n\nJia Yi matched the creation of yin, yang, and all things\nto the casting of metal—\nhis meaning stems from this.\n\nThe alternating exhale and inhale\nare the mutual urging of *action* and *return*.\nThe wondrous must decay into rot,\nand rot must return to the wondrous—\nthis is how things may be noble or base at different times.\n\nTo say that between Heaven and Earth is like the *tuóyuè*\nmeans that all things shaped between the two\nare formed by its inhaling and exhaling,\nits expansion and contraction.\n\nZhuangzi’s discourse on things begins:\n*\"Yin and yang intermingle to form harmony, and thus things arise.\nEbb and flow, fullness and emptiness—\none dark, one bright—\ndaily changing, monthly transforming,\never acting yet unseen in its function,\nbeginning and ending in life and death,\ncontrasting yet endless, unknown in its extremity.\"*\n\nYin and yang intermingle, and all things draw life from it—\nthis is the origin of things.\n*Action* and *return* are the progression of generation and transformation.\nEbb and flow, full and empty—\nyin and yang in motion, governing the inhale and exhale of the *tuóyuè*.\nChange and transformation, life and death—\nthings alternately becoming *sacrificial dogs*.\n\nLaozi borrowed the *tuóyuè* and *sacrificial dog* to speak of his principles;\nZhuangzi directly transmitted them in affairs.\n\nMany words exhaust meaning—\nbetter to *guard-the-center*.\n\nAll schools say this *center* is the *middle* of *Zhōngyōng*[*The Doctrine of the Mean*],\nbut Su Huangmen [*Su Xun*] disagrees:\n*\"This is the void of the *tuóyuè* dwelling in the center—*\nhis explanation is correct.\"*\n\nLaozi sought to establish a singular doctrine,\nand thus altered or replaced all the *Six Classics*’ terms for the Dao.\n\nThe *Six Classics* speak of *middle*—\nLaozi called this *good*.\nYet he never spoke of *middle* in his own book.\n\nThen what is this *middle*?\nLike the *center* of a *domain*, an *archer’s bow*, or a *ring*—\nnaming a place within things,\nnot like the *middle* of *Zhōngyōng*,\nwhich reaches the utmost and names its principle.\n\nThus, *guard-the-center*\nrefers specifically to the *center* of the *tuóyuè*,\nto be held as its pivot—\nlike the *shū* [*pivot*] attaining the *center* of the *ring*,\nto respond to the boundless.\n\nSpeakers first act and then name what they describe—\nsaying, *\"This deed’s virtue/power is all my doing.\"*\nYet when applied to the world,\nit may or may not be fitting,\nmay or may not align—\nthis cannot be certain.\n\n「If one does not wait for the fitting moment but first gives form to words,\nthen those who conjecture and guess may occasionally hit upon the truth—\nbut those who conjecture and guess without hitting the mark are far more numerous,\nand their efforts inevitably lead to exhaustion.\n\nIf one instead *guards-the-center*,\nthe response to sensation at first seems sluggish and dull,\nyet in the end, it never falters or reaches exhaustion.\nThus it is said: *\"It is better to guard-the-center.\"*\n\nDiscussing the space between heaven and earth is like speaking of *tuóyuè*—\nits rise and fall all depend on the *succession* of the *Daode*’s *forging*.\n\nThe *Daode* is the one who wields *transformations*.\nTo allow oneself to be emptied and thus yield to the *Daode*’s manipulation,\none becomes the source of the ebb and flow of *yin* and *yang*—\nfor all things with form, emptiness brings fluidity,\nfluidity allows for *inducing change*;\nsolidity brings stagnation,\nstagnation leads only to inertness.\n\nThe *tuó*’s capacity to *absorb*,\nthe *yuè*’s capacity to *exhale*,\nboth arise from their emptiness.\nWithout the *tuó*’s emptiness, there would be no way to contain its *absorbing*;\nwithout the *yuè*’s emptiness, there would be no way to effect its *exhaling*.\nIf the *tuóyuè* remains ever-empty,\nit can receive the *eternal generation* of the *Daode* as its *rise*,\nand receive the *transformations* of the *Daode* as its *fall*—\nthis is like borrowing the hollow space within the *tuóyuè*\nto illustrate that what is not stagnant can still receive.\n\nOnly because it is not stagnant\ndoes the *spreading qi* find a way to enter it.\nThe *Daode*’s *mechanism* is triggered by movement,\nand it is *stirred* to *rise*—\nthis is its ability to manipulate *generation* and *transformation*.\nBecause it remains empty yet unyielding,\nit can receive what is present\nand manifest it in the world.\n\nThe *yin* and *yang qi* hides within the *Great Emptiness*,\nyet takes form in sensation.\nWhen sensation responds,\nit can bring forth the *non-existent* as the *existent*.\n\nThe *tuóyuè* is not the *Great Emptiness*—\nits emptiness allows for reception,\nits reception does not cling—\nit mirrors the *symbol* of all things entering and exiting the *mechanism*,\nso this *mechanism* never ceases,\nand *rise* and *fall* are endless.\n\nThus, the one who remains *still* and *unmoving*\nis able to respond to sensation and thereby attain fluidity.\n\nDiscussing the marvel of the *tuóyuè*\nis nearly akin to the *Gu shén*—\nyet it cannot be fully aligned with it.\nThe *Gu shén* can *self-regulate* existence and non-existence,\nwhile the *tuóyuè*’s *exhaling* and *absorbing*\nstill depend on the *Daode*’s *transformation*.\nWhen *stirred* to *exhale*,\nit differs from *self-receiving* and *self-responding*—\nthus this chapter speaks of the *tuóyuè*,\nand the next chapter turns to the *Gu shén*.\n\n**Zhān Qiūpǔ** said:\n*\"Heaven and earth’s lack of virtue/power is as extreme as guarding-the-center.*\nThe *Daode*’s *non-attachment* chapter states that heaven and earth do not act from partiality or favor as virtue/power,\nbut treat all things as *fuel-for-sacrifice*—\nthe wise do not act from partiality or favor as virtue/power,\nbut treat the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*.\n\n*Fuel-for-sacrifice* is sufficient to feed horses and cattle,\nand dogs are sufficient to guard homes—\nthese are all useful things,\nrelied upon by people for their needs.\nThe space between heaven and earth is like the *tuóyuè*—\nits hollow center can *fan* and stir to generate *wind*,\nyet though it is hollow, it does not bend or break.\nThis is the marvel of *non-attachment*—\nwhen *fanning wind*, the more one moves, the more it exhales,\nits marvel is beyond naming—\nyet it is not as profound as steadfastly *guarding-the-center*,\nwhich allows for boundless use.\n\n**Zhāng Chōngyìng** replied:\n*\"Heaven and earth’s lack of virtue/power is as extreme as guarding-the-center.*\nThe virtue/power of the *Dao* is vast and boundless,\nbeyond any form or description—\nthus Confucius rarely spoke of it,\nand Laozi did not claim it as his own.\nRarely speaking means that it cannot be described in words,\nand not claiming it means that it cannot be described yet he does not dwell on it either.\nHeaven and earth do not claim virtue/power as their own,\nthus they can *cover* and *encompass*—\nall things generate and grow within them,\nyet they do not know how they come to be.\nThe sage does not claim virtue/power as their own,\nthus they can *include* and *contain*—\nthe people thrive and rest within them,\nyet they do not know how they come to thrive.\nAll is seen as *fuel-for-sacrifice*—\nloved and nurtured,\nyet never cherished or held dear,\nfor fear of harm or decay—\nthe heart remains unperturbed, without attachment.\n\nThe reason heaven and earth lack virtue/power,\nthe reason the sage lacks virtue/power,\nis that they follow the *single principle* of *qi* as it flows endlessly above and below—\nlike the *tuóyuè*’s capacity to *enclose*,\nor the *yuè*’s capacity to *blow*—\ncirculating without end,\nencompassing without limit—\nthough empty, it is never exhausted when *blown*,\nthough vast, it is never diminished when *stirred*—\nthe virtue/power of the *Dao* is boundless like this.\nThus Confucius said:\n*\"What words does heaven have?*\nThe *Four Seasons* move in their course.\"\nThen the heart of heaven and earth, of all things,\nhas no voice within it.\n\nIf one desires to learn the *Dao*,\nto embody the *transformations* of heaven and earth,\nand yet still clings to words,\ntheir tongue will tire,\ntheir spirit will be disordered,\ntheir essence will be depleted,\nand their *qi* will falter—\nall will reach exhaustion.\n\nThus it is said: *\"It is better to guard-the-center.\"*\nOne should *guard* this *square-inch* [of the heart],\nand *spread virtue/power* among things,\nyet not reveal its traces.\n\n**Bái Yùchán** said:\n*\"Heaven and earth lack virtue/power—*\nthey have no *heart* and treat all things as *fuel-for-sacrifice*,\nletting them be as they are.\nThe sage lacks virtue/power—\nthey take heaven and earth’s *heart* as their own,\nand treat the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*,\nyet still *forget-the-self*—\nwhat else could there be?\n\nThe space between heaven and earth is the *heart*—\nis it like the *tuóyuè*?\nIt flows without ceasing,\nempty yet unyielding,\nits use is endless.\nWhen *stirred*, it exhales ever more,\npure and unchanging.\nHow can it be spoken of?\nIt is better to *guard-the-center*,\nto exhaust what lies within us.\n\n**Liào Cuìrán** said:\n*\"Heaven and earth lack virtue/power—*\nthey originate from humanity,\nyet if one *returns* to their *root*,\ntreating all things as *fuel-for-sacrifice*,\nthen one should regard all things as *unconscious objects*—\nin humanity, one must also *overcome-the-self* in this way.\nThe sage lacks virtue/power—\nhumanity’s ruler is also rooted in virtue/power,\nyet by *returning* to their *root* and *restoring* to the *origin*,\ntreating the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*—\none should abandon all the people as *useless objects*,\nas in humanity, one must also *revert to ritual*.\"」\n\nThe space between Heaven and Earth,\nwithin its embrace—\nlike the bellows and flute, is it not?\n\nTo Heaven and Earth, it is vast emptiness.\nTo my body, it is a stinking sack.\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nwhen released, it fills the six directions,\nwhen gathered, it does not overflow a single fistful.\nStirred, it exhales ever more—\n*original qi* surging forth,\nendless and unceasing.\n\nToo much speech leads to exhaustion,\nbetter to align with silence,\nto seal the lips like a bottle.\nIt is better to *guard-the-center*,\nto embrace the *original* and uphold the *One*,\nendless and boundless.\n\nIf humanity acts thus,\nthe *Dao-qi* will be preserved.\n\n**Chén Bìxū** said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth lack virtue/power*\nuntil they treat the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*—\n*Sū* (草), the grass.\nTo bind the grass as a dog,\nancient rites used it for sacrifice,\nto dispel omens of ill fortune,\nand cast it aside once used—\nin ordinary times, they did not cherish it,\nyet when cast aside, they did not hate it either.\nThus, *fuel-for-sacrifice* is formed by divine intelligence,\nyet divine intelligence has no use for it.\n\nWithout use, there is no partiality;\nwithout partiality, there is no favor.\nTherefore, Heaven and Earth, though lacking in favor,\ngenerate great favor;\nthe sage, though not virtuous,\nachieves great virtue.\n\nTo lack virtue/power—\nit means no attachment to love,\nnot that they scorn what is evil.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth, without attachment,\nregard all things as *fuel-for-sacrifice*,\ndemanding no return from the myriad creatures.\nThe sage, without attachment,\nregards the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*,\ndemanding no return from the people.\nThis is the natural way of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Yán Jūnping** said:\n*\"Heaven is high and clear,\nEarth is thick and tranquil.\nYin and Yang intermingle,\nharmonious *qi* flows unceasing,\nyet effortlessly, all things arise naturally.\nHeaven and Earth do not strain their hearts,\nmove their intentions,\nexhaust their spirits,\nor labor over affairs—\nno anxious care,\nno lavish love,\nno spreading of favor,\nno granting of benefits—\nyet all things are fulfilled.\nThis is what is meant by\n*Heaven and Earth lack virtue/power,\ntreating all things as fuel-for-sacrifice*.\n\nThe enlightened king and sage\nuphold the *Dao-qi* in harmony,\nclear and unchanging,\ntransforming through the *One*,\ndivine intelligence silently guiding,\nconforming to the *Dao*'s rites,\nthe world responding,\nall things transforming naturally.\nThe sage does not exhaust wisdom,\ndeplete ability,\ndisturb the heart,\nor strain the mind—\nno ceasing of thought,\nno restless wandering,\nno grasping of human affairs,\nno leading of the people—\nyet all is fulfilled.\nThis is what is meant by\n*the sage lacks virtue/power,\ntreating the people as fuel-for-sacrifice*.\n\nThe space between Heaven and Earth is stirred yet ever more exhales—\nThe bellows (*tuó*) holds the wind,\nflute (*yuè*) emits the sound.\nLike the bellows blowing wind to kindle fire,\nor the flute releasing notes to tune the music,\nits application is endless,\nyet it can never be bent.\nThus, the sage—\nwithout partiality, without attachment—\ndoes not engage in love or gain.\n\n**Yán Jūnping** further said:\n*\"If Heaven and Earth abandon emptiness\nand engage in love and gain,\nthen transformation will falter,\nand things will not fully arise.\nIf the sage abandons emptiness\nand engages in love and gain,\nthen virtue and grace will not be universal,\nthe realm will not be at peace,\nfavor will not reach the depths,\nand affairs will not be fully accomplished.\nWhy so?\nFor the art of love demands measure,\nyet the myriad things aspire to boundless transformation.\nTo wield measured gain\nand bestow it upon boundless potential—\nits failure is as certain as a dried riverbed,\nand to aid it is to weep in vain.\n\nAgain he said:\nLice and fleas move upon the hair,\nyet sleep is disturbed by them;\nmosquitoes and flies settle on the skin,\nyet the spirit is agitated,\nthoughts stifled.\nExternal harm from wasp and scorpion venom\npoisons the core within,\nwhile unseen damage to ears and eyes\nleaves all limbs paralyzed.\nThis shows that love and gain,\nwhen harbored in the chest,\ncannot but yield to strain,\nimpurity, and depletion of blood and *qi*.\n\nToo much speech leads to exhaustion,\nbetter to align with silence.\nToo much speech—\nit means excessive words of universal love.\nExcessive words make biased action difficult,\nand thus exhaustion comes,\nbending yet never succeeding.\nIf one follows Heaven and Earth’s emptiness and tranquility,\nand the bellows and flute’s heartlessness,\nembracing and upholding the *center’s harmony*,\nthen its natural sufficiency will be enough.\nIt also lies in the teaching of *non-speech*.\n*The Honglie Jie* says:\n*Wáng Shòu* carried books as he walked,\nand met *Xú Féng* in Zhou.\n*Xú Féng* said:\n*‘Affairs arise from responding to change,\nand change is born of time,\nso one who knows time has no fixed action.\nBooks are the source of speech,\nand speech comes from knowledge.\nKnowledge keeps the books hidden.’*\nThus, *Wáng Shòu* burned his books\nand danced, saying:\n*‘Too much speech leads to exhaustion,\nbetter to align with silence.’*\n\n**Xiè Túnán** said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth lack virtue/power*\nuntil they treat the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*.\nAll things receive Heaven and Earth’s *qi* to arise,\nthe people receive the sage’s grace to flourish—\nto say they lack virtue/power is impossible.\nYet rise and fall, success and failure,\nare entrusted to natural forces,\nand life and death, calamity and fortune,\nare summoned by humanity alone.\nHeaven and Earth, the sage—\nin this, they have no attachment at all.\nTo say they lack virtue/power\nis not to say they lack it.\nIt is that they cannot wield their virtue/power in action.\n*Fuel-for-sacrifice*—\nit is the remnant after sacrifice,\nleft to its own formation and decay,\nwith no further thought given to it.\nThe space between Heaven and Earth—\nits principle for all things is natural and effortless,\nthus the two *qi* of Yin and Yang\nflow through the void without obstruction,\nlike the bellows and flute.\nThe bellows has no bottom,\nthe flute has holes.\nThe bellows’ emptiness allows *qi* to circulate,\nunbending, unbroken;\nthe flute’s holes let sound resonate,\never more exhale, never cease.\nAll this is natural and effortless.\nThings and humanity within Heaven and Earth—\ntheir beginning and end, their transformation—\nare also natural and effortless.\nThus, too much speech leads to repeated exhaustion,\nand cannot be fully accomplished,\nbetter to uphold the *One*’s central principle.\"*\n\nThe principle reaches its apex in *zhōng* and stops there.\nHeaven and Earth, sages, common folk, all things under Heaven—\nnone exist beyond this *zhōng*.\n\nNow let us examine this:\nAll things and all people share this same *qi*.\nAll beings between Heaven and Earth share this same mind.\n\nWhat is Heaven’s mind?\nTo nurture life is its mind.\nWhat is the sage’s mind?\nTo love the people is its mind.\n\nYet at the beginning, when life first arises,\nit cannot but change by its end.\nAt the start, when love is given,\nit cannot but differ later.\n\nWhy?\nHeaven’s way establishes Yin and Yang,\nhumanity’s way establishes *rén* and *yì*.\nLife emerges—this is Yang—\nyet it cannot lack the solemn and killing Yin.\nNurturing is *rén*—\nyet it cannot lack the cutting and restraining *yì*.\nThis is the natural course of things.\n\nEven a humble *chúgǒu*—a minor thing—\nyet when it is nurtured for sacrifice,\none fears its integrity may be incomplete.\nBut once the sacrifice is done,\nit is cast aside as useless,\ncrushed and broken—\nnone can escape this fate.\n\nAll beings in Heaven and Earth\nshare the same original endowment,\nand all life is worthy of love.\nYet once formed, they scatter and differ—\nsome are cultivated, some are toppled,\nsome are blessed, some are doomed,\neach following its own portion.\n\nAt this time,\nHeaven and Earth’s nurturing virtue,\nthe sage’s loving care—\nthere are aspects that cannot be fully preserved.\nTo call this *not-rén* is to say\none cannot exhaust one’s *rén*.\n\nHeaven and Earth use the *zhōng*’s emptiness—\nlike the bellows and flute—to nurture all things.\nThe sage uses the *zhōng*’s path\nto respond and reciprocate with the people.\n\nThus, in one word, it is said:\n*\"Better to uphold the *zhōng*.\"*\n\nWhat is this *zhōng*?\nIs it the utmost impartiality, without favor?\nIs it the avoidance of excess or deficiency?\n\nLin Yōngzhāi said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth’s lack of *rén* is why one must uphold the *zhōng*.\"*\n\nNurturing life—this is *rén*.\nYet Heaven and Earth, though they nurture life,\ndo not claim it as merit,\nforgetting themselves with all things.\n\nNurturing the people—this is *rén*.\nYet the sage, though nurturing the people,\ndoes not claim it as favor,\nforgetting themselves with the people.\n\n*Not-rén* means not possessing one’s own *rén*.\nThe *chúgǒu*, once used and discarded,\nis an illustration of mutual forgetting.\n\nChapter Thirty-Eight says:\n*\"The sage’s highest virtue is without virtue,\nthus it has virtue.\"*\n\n*Not-rén* is like *not-de*.\nIn *Zhuangzi’s* *\"Qíwù\"*:\n*\"Great *rén* is not *rén*.\"*\nIn *\"Tiāndì\"*:\n*\"In the age of perfect virtue,\nthey love one another without knowing it as *rén*.\"*\n\nThis is the same meaning.\n\nThe *chúgǒu*—\nwhen used in sacrifice, it is honored;\nonce the sacrifice is done, it is cast aside—\nan illustration of not dwelling on it,\nof mutual forgetting.\n\nSpeaking precisely,\nthis implies the intent to transform what is excessive.\nBut if one takes this to mean\ntreating the people as grass and chaff,\nthat is mistaken.\n\nThe teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi delight in shocking the world and defying convention, hence their language often contains flaws.\n\nThis chapter’s core meaning is simply:\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth does not harbor intent in nurturing life,\nThe sage does not harbor intent in nourishing the people.\nYet it speaks thus in strange metaphors,\nand readers who lack precision fall into deep error.\n\nThus it is said that the harshness of Shen Buhai and Han Feizi\noriginates from the intent of treating the people as *chúgǒu*.\nEven Laozi cannot evade blame for this.\n\nThe *kǒu* (口) is the tube of the *tuó* (橐).\nWhen the *tuó* and *kǒu* are used, wind arises.\nThough its body is hollow,\nwhen applied, it does not bend—\nmovement generates wind,\nthe more it operates, the more it produces.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nits nurturing of myriad things is likewise so.\nThe *tuó* and *kǒu* do not harbor intent in generating wind—\nHeaven and Earth do not harbor intent in nurturing life.\nThus, this metaphor is used.\nMoreover, when used, wind arises;\nwhen unused, it ceases—\nthis too implies the intent of transforming excess.\n\n*Shù* (数) means \"repeatedly.\"\n*Shǒu zhōng* (守中) means silently closing one’s mouth.\nIt means:\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth cannot be fully expressed in words;\nexcessive speech repeatedly leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to remain silent and forget words.\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"I wish to speak not at all.\"*\nWhat speech can Heaven have?\nThe four seasons move within it,\nmyriad things are born within it.\nThis is the same meaning.\n\nYet the sage’s words are pure and easily understood,\nwhile this text oscillates wildly, making it difficult to grasp.\nSome may say it warns against excessive speech,\nbut this contradicts the chapter’s intent.\n\nIf one sees through this,\nnot only does the beginning and end cohere,\nthe meaning becomes clear,\nbut its language is also concise, profound, and ancient—\nhow could this be easily attained?\n\nFan Yingyuan said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating myriad things as *chúgǒu*.*\n*Virtue* is the principle of love.\nIt is said that Heaven and Earth’s nurturing is vast,\nyet they do not speak of virtue—\ntoward myriad things, it is like binding straw into a dog for sacrifice.\nBefore it is presented, it is carried in a wicker basket,\ncovered with embroidered cloth—\nnot out of love, but because of the occasion.\nOnce the sacrifice is complete,\npassersby trample its head and back,\nfirewood gatherers take it for fuel—\nnot that they do not love it,\nbut because of the occasion.\nSpring and summer nurture growth,\nlike the *chúgǏu* before presentation;\nautumn and winter wither and fall,\nlike the *chúgǒu* after discard—\nall is the work of the seasons.\nHow could it be that they love in spring and summer\nbut do not love in autumn and winter?\nWhen *qi* arrives, myriad things act without knowing why—\nthe sage is without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*.\nThe sage embodies this Dao to universally love,\nhis virtue is thus supreme.\nYet he does not speak of virtue—\ntoward the people, it is like Heaven and Earth toward myriad things:\naiding their natural unfolding without harm,\nensuring life and death proceed without regret,\nso they do not know the Emperor’s power over them.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, the more it moves, the more it produces.\nThe bag is called *tuó*, the bamboo tube is called *kǒu*.\nIn smelting, the *kǒu* connects the *tuó* to channel *qi* and blow the furnace fire.\n*Qū* (屈) means \"bent.\"\n*The Yīn Biàn* says: *\"Yú\"* (俞) is pronounced as *\"yáng zhū\"* (羊朱).\nFù Yì cites *Guang Yǎ*: *\"Yú\"* means \"benefit.\"\nThe *Han Shǐ* records the people’s suffering and hardship as *\"yú\"* (俞).\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, it is only empty and flowing—\nlike the bamboo tube channeling *qi*,\nempty yet unbent—\nwhen *qi* comes, it passes through;\nwhen *qi* departs, it does not accumulate.\nIt is like the *tuó* wind:\nthe more it moves, the more it produces.\nOnce the furnace’s materials are refined into forms,\nthe *tuó* and *kǒu* never speak of virtue or love.\n\nExcessive speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to uphold the central emptiness of Heaven and Earth,\nwithout deviation, so that myriad things naturally find their place.\nHow could there be exhaustion?\n\nXué Yǒngzhāi said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*.*\nHeaven and Earth nurture myriad things\nyet harbor no intent toward them.\nThe sage nourishes the people\nyet harbors no intent toward them.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, the more it moves, the more it produces.\nThe *tuó* and *kǒu* remain unobstructed in their emptiness,\nthus the more they move, the more sound they produce.\nHeaven and Earth’s ability to transform and nurture myriad things without exhaustion\nlies in their emptiness and their ability to move.\nExcessive speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to uphold the central emptiness.\"\n\nHuì Shī’s eloquence\nis not as good as Yán Zhī’s silent cultivation.\n\nXiū Xiū’ān said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*—*\n*until it is better to uphold central emptiness.*\nThe *chúgǒu* is a straw dragon bound for sacrifice,\nenclosed in a red lacquered case,\ncovered with embroidered cloth—\nonce the sacrifice ends, it is discarded.\nHeaven and Earth, the sage—\nthey embody the marvel of *wuwei*,\nnurturing myriad things without expecting gratitude,\nnot claiming ownership,\nallowing things to transform naturally,\nlike the *chúgǒu*—\nthus it seems as though they are without virtue.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, it is empty like a *tuó* bag,\n*qi* flows and runs, nurturing myriad things.\nA clear and empty mind is likewise so.\nA spontaneous spark of insight,\nendless wondrous application—\nthis is called empty yet unbending,\nmoving yet ever producing.\nThe *tuó* is the *tuó* bag,\nthe *kǒu* is the tube—\ninstruments for stirring wind and movement.\nThough this metaphor illustrates the marvel of transformation,\nexcessive speech only distances one from the Dao.\nEven with great eloquence and repeated analogies,\nmetaphors are limited in number,\nwhile this Dao is beyond all metaphor—\nbetter to remain silent.\nThe subtlety of upholding central emptiness\ncan reveal the penetration of transformation.\n\nChǔ Bóxiù said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*—*\n*until it is better to uphold central emptiness.*\n*Virtue* is the concrete manifestation of the numinous Dao,\nestablishing the heart of Heaven and Earth,\ncontinuing the mandate of the people—\nlike *yuan* (元) to *qián* (乾),\ngathering all virtues and achieving completeness,\nmolding myriad kinds without omission.\nIn humans, this means perfecting oneself and others,\nuniversal love and benevolent rescue—\nall are its applications.\"*\n\nHeaven and Earth possess natural virtue beyond speech and symbols.\nThe Sage embodies Heaven’s virtue and extends benevolence,\nthus expanding the Imperial Dao and achieving governance.\nYet the text speaks of \"not-ren\" (不仁)—why?\nIt means their virtue is not displayed,\nlike *upper virtue* not being called virtue—\na paradoxical statement.\nUsing the analogy of bound straw shaped as a dog for sacrifice,\nbefore sacrifice it is adorned with love and respect,\nafterward discarded and trampled—\nits creation and destruction are mere transformations,\nnot rooted in affection or aversion.\nThis reveals the true nature beneath illusion,\nand the logic of things becomes clear.\n\nAll moving, growing, flying, and swimming beings,\ntheir birth, flourishing, decline, and return,\nare but the circulation of one *qi*,\nflowing endlessly—\nlike bound straw becoming a dog,\nthen the dog returning to straw.\nHow could there be any intentionality here?\n\nThe Sage, regarding the people,\nlets them pursue their affairs,\nwhile the Dao naturally unfolds.\nThis is what Zhuangzi meant by *\"great virtue is not-ren.\"*\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, it is like the bellows and windbox.\nThis also speaks of its lack of intention.\nThe bellows and windbox, when activated,\nblow air through the pipes—\nlike the circulation of *qi* in yin and yang,\nbreathing without pause.\nAll beings and things are cast in its molding.\nOnly when it remains centrally empty and unobstructed\ndoes its movement of *qi* flow ever outward.\nThis principle harmonizes perfectly with the transformations of creation—\nwhy speak further, only to exhaust oneself?\nBetter to uphold the bellows and windbox within oneself,\nto explore the Heaven and Earth within,\nfor where is the logic of generating all things?\n\nSome interpret the excessive words of the restless as an explanation,\nbut this does not align with the context above and below.\nThe core meaning of this passage lies in *\"upholding centrality.\"*\nThe profound truth is so subtle and mysterious\nthat only scholars who practice diligently\ncan verify within themselves the presence of a Heaven and Earth—\nfor it exists within the human body alone.\n\n**Niu Miaozhuan said:**\nHeaven and Earth are not-ren,\ntreating all things as bound straw-dogs.\nYet the great virtue of Heaven and Earth is *generation*—\nunceasing generation is called *ren*.\n*Ren* is the virtue of Heaven and Earth’s creation.\nYet it says \"not-ren\"—\nmeaning Heaven and Earth do not possess virtue for themselves.\nAll things are the myriad kinds filling Heaven and Earth.\nThe bound straw-dog refers to ancient sage-kings’ sacrifices,\nwhere straw was bound into dog-shaped offerings—\n*Shu* (刍) being reeds or thatch.\nThough reeds are humble, their use is weighty;\nthe dog, a domesticated beast,\nholds the *xu* (戌) position and corresponds to *Qian* (乾).\nThus, ancient people shaped reeds into dogs for sacrifice,\nsymbolizing their reverence.\nIf Heaven and Earth treat all things as bound straw-dogs,\nit is not that they hold them lightly.\nSome argue that Heaven and Earth regard all things\nas mindless straw and beasts,\nexpecting no reciprocation—\nthis reasoning is flawed.\nAll things share *qi* with Heaven and Earth in their origin,\nonly differing in the smallness of their form.\nIf Heaven and Earth truly viewed all things\nas mere straw and beasts,\nthen they would be selfishly hoarding their own greatness—\nwould that not be *not-ren*?\nThis is my shallow understanding.\nThe enlightened will discern it.\n\nThe Sage is not-ren,\ntreating the people as bound straw-dogs.\nThe Sage is the complete embodiment of utility,\na teacher for all ages.\nThus, the people revere them like the sun and moon,\nlook up to them like parents.\nYet it is called \"not-ren\"—\nnot claiming virtue for oneself,\na humble and exalted stance,\nas Confucius himself did not dwell on it.\nThe people are the common folk.\nThough the Sage and the people share the same *qi*,\ntheir noble or humble, prosperous or destitute fates differ.\nIf the Sage treats the people as bound straw-dogs,\nit is not that they are held lightly.\nSome say the Sage views the people\nas mindless straw and beasts,\nexpecting no reciprocation—\nthis interpretation is likely mistaken.\nHumans stand alongside Heaven and Earth,\nthe Three Powers in equilibrium—\nhow could they be compared to straw and beasts?\nMencius said:\n*\"If a ruler treats his ministers as hands and feet,\nthe ministers will treat the ruler as their heart.\nIf a ruler treats his ministers as dogs and horses,\nthe ministers will treat the ruler as a commoner.\nIf a ruler treats his ministers as dust and weeds,\nthe ministers will treat the ruler as an enemy.\"*\nIf the Sage truly regarded the people\nas mere straw and beasts,\nthen the Sage would indeed be not-ren.\nMy fellow seekers,\nI earnestly hope you will discern this truth.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nthe more movement, the more it emerges.\n\nThe bellows belong to the drum family.\nThe *piào* (笛) is a flute, of the pipe family.\n*\"Yóu\"* (犹) means *\"like.\"*\n\nMovement means *use*.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, the void is empty,\nyet it employs the Four Seasons and Five Phases.\nThe bellows and *piào* are instruments—\ntheir emptiness is void,\nemploying the Five Tones and Six Pitches.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Between Heaven and Earth, it is like the bellows and *piào*.\"*\n\nThe Old Master (老君) said:\n*\"The bellows and *piào* are instruments,\ntheir value lies in their use.\nEmpty yet full, present yet absent,\nround yet square, vast yet minute,\nlong yet short, broad yet narrow—\nthey follow the player’s will,\nyet do not compete for mastery.\nHumans in the world—\nare they not like the bellows and *piào*?\nThey do not contend with all things,\nyet their virtue naturally returns.\nThis is because they are humble, empty, and without striving.\nThis truly speaks of Heaven and Earth’s virtue:\nto receive all things in their void,\nto let nature take its course,\nto follow the people’s desires,\nnot to contend with things,\njust as the bellows and *piào*\nfollow the player’s breath and notes.\"*\n\nToo much speech leads to regret.\nSpeech is the voice of the heart.\nIn the heart, it is *intent* (志);\nwhen expressed, it is speech.\n*\"Shù\"* (数) means *frequent*;\n*\"qióng\"* (穷) means *regret and loss*.\nToo much speech means too many faults—\nthus it is said: *\"Too much speech leads to regret.\"*\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"A single word can ruin a state—\nthis is the speech of the highest kind of fool.\nA single word can bring disaster—\nthis is the speech of the middling fool.\nA single word can bring shame—\nthis is the speech of the lowest fool.\"*\n\nThus Heaven has the *rolling-tongue star* (卷舌之星),\nand humans have the *sealed-mouth inscription* (缄口之铭).\nSpeech cannot be taken lightly.\nIt is said:\n*\"The gentleman desires to be slow in speech yet quick in action.\"*\nThis is indeed correct.\n\nIn ancient times, Confucius observed the Zhou,\nand entered the Temple of Houji (后稷).\nOn the right step stood a golden man,\nhis mouth sealed three times,\nwith an inscription on his back:\n*\"A man of caution in speech in ancient times.\nBeware of excessive speech!\"*\nAvoid too much speech—\ntoo much speech leads to failure.\nAvoid too much action—\ntoo much action leads to calamity.\n\nThe *Book of Poetry* (《诗》) says:\n*\"Revere your bearing,\nbe cautious in your words.\"*\nThis is what it means.\n\nBetter still is to *guard the Middle* (守中).\nThe *Middle* is the *pivot and mechanism* (枢机).\nTo *guard* means to be *vigilant* (谨).\nMoreover, the sun and moon—\nthey are Heaven’s *ornaments* (文).\nMountains and rivers—\nthey are Earth’s *ornaments*.\nSpeech and language—\nthey are humanity’s *ornaments*.\nYet speech issues from the mouth,\nlike a blade held in check—\ndo not move it lightly.\nIt is like a drawn bowstring,\nwhich may still be stopped,\nbut once the arrow leaves the string,\neven if you wish to recall it,\nyou cannot.\n\nThe *Appendices to the Changes* (《系辞》) say:\n*\"Words issue from the self and affect the people;\nactions arise nearby and are seen afar.\nSpeech and action—\nthe pivot and mechanism of the gentleman.\nWhen the pivot and mechanism are set in motion,\nhonor and disgrace are determined.\nSpeech and action—\nby which the gentleman moves Heaven and Earth.\nCan they not be taken with caution?\nThis is the meaning of *better still is to guard the Middle*.\"*\n\nThe *Book of Changes* (《易》) says:\n*\"To bind the bag without blame or praise—\nthis is indeed caution, is it not?\"*\n\nYang Zhìrén (杨智仁) said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth’s lack of virtue is the ultimate *guard the Middle* (守中).*\nHeaven and Earth do not act with virtue,\nyet they regard all things as *straw-dogs* (刍狗).\nThey bestow transformation without virtue or favor—\nnature takes its course,\nand they do not expect reciprocation.\nThe Sage is the same.\nFor those who study the Dao/Way,\ndo not cling to even a single hair of material desire.\nIf the Great Void (太虚) is calm and ever still,\nand the *Three Powers* (三才) operate within it,\nthe *bellows and *piào* (橐钥) sound through the cosmos,\nthe Original Qi (元炁) ascends and descends in the Yellow Court (黄庭),\nthe *Kàn* (坎) and *Lí* (离) transform in their cycles,\nthe *Sè* (塞) and *Duì* (兑) hang their veils,\nthe *Hán* (含) and *Guāng* (光) remain silent—\nempty yet never yielding,\nguarding with *chōnghé* (冲和),\nunmoved by trifles,\nyet ever more active when moved—\nthis is the ancient saying:\n*'Preserve the body, let go of all,\nand not a single thought arises.'*\nIf one speaks too much and regrets it,\nthere is loss without gain—\nfar better is to *guard the Middle* for ages.\nRefined and natural,\nit blends into one piece.\n\nThe Confucianists say:\n*'The Sage’s Dao/Way is nothing but virtue and righteousness, moderation and correctness.'*\nHeaven, Earth, and the Sage regard all things as straw-dogs—\nthey do not cling to anything.\nThe gentleman is matched to Heaven and Earth—\nis he not like the bellows and *piào*?\nEmpty yet never yielding,\nactive yet ever more so.\nMost simple, most easy—\nhow difficult is it to know?\nThus, too much speech leads to regret,\nand better is to *guard the Middle*.\"\n\nThe gentleman is *yellow-centered and harmonious* (黄中通理),\nnever losing his *correctness* (正).\n\nIn further analogy:\n*\"Heaven and Earth’s lack of virtue is the ultimate *guard the Middle*.\"*\nWhat does Heaven speak?\nThe Four Seasons move,\nand all things are born.\nHeaven and Earth give birth to things\nyet do not claim virtue for themselves—\nthey forget about things.\nUnknowing yet unknowing,\nthey follow the *imperial norm* (帝则),\nand the *imperial force* (帝力) has no hold on them.\n\nThe Sage nourishes the people\nyet does not claim virtue for himself—\nhe forgets about the people.\n*\"Straw-dog\"* (刍) is *straw*;\nit symbolizes *bundled straw shaped like a dog*.\nThe *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》□*Tiān Rùn* [天运]篇) says:\n*\"Before the straw-dog is offered in sacrifice,\nit is adorned with embroidered bags,\nwrapped in silk and brocade.\nAfter the sacrifice is complete,\npassersby trample its head and back,\nand woodcutters take it to fuel their fires.\nIt is honored before the sacrifice,\nyet despised after the rites are done.\nThis is the analogy—\nit embodies the intent of *transcending form and passing beyond transformation*.\"*\n\nI have read Liu Zizhu’s (柳子) *Biography of Guo Tuótuo* (《郭橐驼传》),\nand from cultivating trees,\nI have learned the art of nurturing people.\nGuo Tuótuo’s method of planting trees—\ndo not disturb it, do not fret over it;\nonce planted, leave it be.\nWhen tending, treat it like a child;\nwhen setting it down, treat it like discarding.\nA father toward his child—\nhow often does he claim credit for his kindness?\nHis poetry is like a child:\nborn and raised,\nyet he does not claim virtue for himself—\nit is simply what he possesses.\nIf he errs and forgets his possession,\nif he transforms and discards what he has placed,\nit is like abandoning the straw-dog after sacrifice.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nthe bellows are struck, the *piào* is played—\none instrument alone.\n\n*\"Tuó\"* (橐) means *leather bag*;\n*\"qiào\"* (钥) means *pipe*—\nthe tool by which wind is drawn.\nEmpty within yet never yielding in use,\nthe more it is moved, the more it emerges;\nthe more it emerges, the more it has.\nIts origin is boundless,\nits issue endless.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth and the Sage is also like this.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth cannot be fully expressed in words,\nyet its transformation through sound and color is the most trivial of human affairs.\nHence it is said:\n*\"Many words exhaust the limitless\"*—\nbetter to uphold the **center** (中).\n\nUpholding the **center** (中),\nsilently yet naturally preserving itself.\n\nThe *Xū Liù Xū* (胥六虚) says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth’s lack of virtue/power is no greater than upholding the **center** (中).\"*\n\nThe greatest **virtue/power** of Heaven and Earth is **generation** (生),\nyet it treats all things as straw-dogs.\nIt covers and carries them,\nbut lets those that thrive grow of their own accord,\nwhile those that wither perish on their own—\nHeaven and Earth take no part in this.\nThis is how Heaven and Earth do not possess their **virtue/power** (仁),\nyet treat all things as straw-dogs—\n**virtue/power** (仁) is vast indeed.\n\nThe straw-dog’s purpose:\nbefore sacrifice, it is honored and revered;\nafter sacrifice, it is cast aside—\nnot from a fickle heart,\nbut simply the nature of the moment.\n\nThus, the Sage uses it as an analogy.\n\nThe Sage embodies the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth,\nnurtures the people,\nbroadens and forgives them,\nletting those who flourish do so naturally,\nthose who grow do so of their own accord.\nWith tilling and weaving,\ntheir families prosper and the nation is at peace,\nyet the Sage takes no credit—\nthis too is how the Sage does not claim his **virtue/power** (仁),\nyet treats the people as straw-dogs.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\na single *qi* steams and molds,\nall things **generate** and **transform** (生化),\nunceasing from ancient times to the present.\n\nIt is like the bellows and pipe—\nempty within yet boundless in use.\nWhen struck and moved,\nsound and *qi* flow forth ever more.\nThis praises the Sage’s **virtue/power** (德),\nvast and limitless—\nhis **virtue/power** (仁) nourishes the people yet is not his own.\n\nHow so?\nIt is simply **emptiness** (虚).\n\nThus, in response to the movements of the world,\nthere is no end to his power.\n\nIf one does not grasp the **Dao/Way** (實) of Heaven and Earth’s **non-virtue/power** (不仁), but instead **discerningly** (察然) **seeks** (自好) what is pleasing,\nhanging laws and enacting punishments,\nadorned with elaborate words and phrases,\nto guide the people toward **transformation** (從化),\nhe violates Heaven and contradicts **principle** (理),\ninvoking the wrath of the spirits and the resentment of the people.\nThus he hastens toward the **Dao/Way** of **exhaustion** (穷极),\nand so I urge him: *\"Excessive speech leads to **exhaustion** (穷),\nbetter to hold fast to the **central** (中).\"*\n\n*\"Excessive speech\"* means to adorn with elaborate words and phrases—\nmany words, few principles—\nbetter to grasp my **central** (中) and **silently** (默) **know** (識) and **practice** (行) it,\n**conscientiously** (謹) **guarding** (守) it without loss,\nso that the world observes the **wind** (風) and **transforms** (化).\n\nIs there any **exhaustion** (穷) in **teaching without words** (不言之教)?\n**Cultivating oneself** (修身) also follows this **Dao/Way** (法).\n\n**Gai Yuan Gao** (柴元皋) said: *\"Heaven and Earth are **non-virtue/power** (不仁).\"*\nThey **benefit** (以美利) the world with their **virtue/power** (利) yet do not speak of their own **virtue/power** (利).\nThey treat all things as **straw-dogs** (刍狗).\n**Straw** (刍), **reed** (茅) bound like dogs for sacrifice.\nAt first, when bound, it is **sincere and pure** (誠洁), **strict and solemn** (甚嚴),\nbut once the sacrifice is complete, it is cast aside without regard.\n\nThe **heart of creation** (造物之心) is likewise as the **straw-dog’s beginning and end** (刍狗之始終):\nit follows **nature** (自然).\n\nThe **Sage is **non-virtue/power** (不仁)**.\nThe Sage **embodies** (體) Heaven and Earth,\nyet does not speak of his own **virtue/power** (利).\nHe treats the people as **straw-dogs** (刍狗).\nOnly he fears that a single person might be **neglected in nourishment** (失養),\njust as **strict** (謹) as the first binding of the **reed** (茅),\nnot daring to **overlook** (忽) even a **thread** (毫).\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth lies the **Dao/Way** of the **bellows and pipe** (橐鉤).\n**Bellows** (橐), the **leather bag** (冶韛) for smithing.\n**Pipe** (鉤), the **three-holed flute** (三孔笛).\nBoth are **empty within** (虚其中),\ntheir **breath** (氣) **inhaled and exhaled** (一阖一辟).\nThe same applies to the human body’s **breathing** (呼吸).\n\nThe **nourishment of the people** (養民) occurs within a single **breath** (呼吸),\nnot like Heaven and Earth,\nwhich might cause the people to **lose their place** (失所).\n**Cultivating the body and its functions** (修體用) is likewise.\n**Empty yet unyielding** (虚而不屈),\nits **embodiment** (體) is **unobstructed** (無礙).\n**Moved, yet ever more** (動而愈出),\nits **function** (用) is **inexhaustible** (不穷).\n\nExcessive speech leads to **exhaustion** (穷),\nbetter to hold fast to the **central** (中).\nIf one **boasts of his own virtue** (矜其仁) and **prizes speech** (尚口),\nthen **exhaustion** (穷) is inevitable.\nWho would prefer this\nto **emptiness within, storing the spirit** (虚中存神),\n**embodying** (體) Heaven and Earth?\n\n**Su Jing Jing** (蘇敬靜) said: *\"Heaven and Earth’s **non-virtue** (不仁) is best understood\nas **holding fast to the central** (守中).\"*\nBinding **reed** (刍) into a **straw-dog** (狗),\nit is used during sacrifice,\nthen cast aside afterward.\nThe **straw-dog’s purpose** (用) is **transformed** (化) by the occasion,\nyet Heaven and Earth, though they **generate all things** (生万物),\ndo not **claim the virtue of doing so** (自以为仁).\nThe Sage, though he **nourishes all the people** (养万民),\nalso does not **claim the virtue of doing so** (自以为仁).\nIt is like the **straw-dog**—\nwhen used for sacrifice, it is **employed** (用),\nonce the sacrifice is done, it is **cast aside** (弃).\n**Transformation and decay** (過化) are **forgotten** (相忘),\nhow could they ever **claim the virtue of doing so** (自以为仁)?\n\n**Bellows** (橐) are **leather bags** (冶韛) for smithing.\n**Pipes** (鉤) are **flutes** (管) in music called **羽鉤** (羽钥),\n**keys** (管) in locks called **管鉤** (管钥),\nor **bellows** (橐鉤) in smithing—\nall are **pipes** (管) in essence.\nThe **bellows** (橐) **absorbs** (吸) the

**function of Heaven and Earth in generating all things** (天地生万物之功),\nand **exhaustively speak** (尽言) to **discuss** (以论) their **function** (功),\nyet they do not know\nthat Heaven and Earth **do not exhaust themselves in speech** (不容以言而尽),\nand **excessive speech** (多言) **often leads to exhaustion** (自至於穷极).\nBetter to **silently forget speech** (默默忘言),\nmerely **holding fast to the bellows and

said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth’s relation to all things,\nthe Sage’s relation to the people,\ndo not **warmly nurture** (煦煦然) them with **partiality** (七).\nIt is only to **let them generate and transform

no **private favor or aversion** (好恶之私),\nonly **timely adaptation** (時適然).\n**How much more so** (況乎) for **ebbing and flowing, fullness and emptiness** (消息盈虚),\nwhich are the **constant principles of nature** (理之常)?\nEven Heaven and Earth, the Sage—\nwhat can they do?\n\nOnly **let them fulfill their own generation** (遂其生),\n**conform to their own nature** (若其性),\nwithout **violent winds or torrential rains** (横風暴雨) to **shatter and break** (摧折),\nwithout **erroneous governance or contradictory orders** (舛政逆令) to **obstruct and stall** (迕遏).\nThen their **virtue/power** (仁) is **also

(動而愈出).\n**Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness** (消息盈虚),\n**reciprocally complete each other** (相为终始),\nand it is no different.\n\nThe **earlier scholars** (先儒) said:\n*\"The **Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth** (乾坤) in **movement and stillness** (动静),\ncannot **close and gather** (翕聚) without **dispersing and emitting** (能发散).\"*\nThis is the same **principle** (意).\n\nAgain, applying this **principle** (理),\nbetween **speech and silence** (语默),\n**excessive speech** (多言) leads to **exhaustion** (穷)\nbecause it **opens without closing** (有张而无翕).\n**Holding fast to the central** (守中) allows one to **remain empty yet unyielding** (虚而不屈),\nthus **never exhausting** (不穷).\n\nFrom the *\"Lost Records\"* (《拾遗》), **Lu** (陆) said:\n*\"All things **draw sustenance from Heaven and Earth** (资天地) to **generate** (而生).\nHeaven and Earth **take nothing from all things** (无取於万物).\nThe people **look up to the Sage** (仰圣人) for **governance** (而治),\nthe Sage **borrows nothing from the people** (无假於百姓).\nIt is like the **straw-dog** **arising from divine offerings** (因神明) yet **used by no one** (无用於刍狗).\n\nOnly when **there is no use** (无用) is there **no partiality** (无私),\nand when **there is no partiality** (无私), there is **no favor** (无恩).\nThus Heaven and Earth **have no favor** (无恩) yet **great favor is produced** (大恩生),\nthe Sage **is not virtuous** (不仁) yet **great virtue is achieved** (大仁成).\nTherefore the people **do not decline the Sage’s virtue** (不辞德於圣人),\nall things **do not repay Heaven and Earth for their generation** (不谢生於天地).\n\nHow do we **know this is so** (知其然哉)?\nI observe between Heaven and Earth—\nit is like the **bellows and pipe’s lack of intention** (无心).\nThe **bellows and pipe** (橐钥) **lack intention** (无心),\nso their **sound** (声) is **unyielding** (不屈),\ntheir **breath** (气) **flows forth ever more** (愈出).\nHeaven and Earth **lack intention** (无心),\nso their **generation and completion** (生成) **do not cease** (不息).\nThus **governance does not rely on excessive speech** (治不在多言),\nand **excessive speech without substance** (多言而无实)\nleads to **movement and exhaustion** (动数穷).\n\nBetter than **non-action and silence** (无为无言),\nwhich is the **art of holding fast to the central** (守中之术).\"\n\nThe *Zhuzi Pangzheng* cites *Zhuangzi*:\n\n\"The **straw dog** before its ritual use\nis adorned with wicker baskets and embroidered cloth,\nand the officiants, in solemn ritual, escort it.\nBut once the ritual is complete,\npassersby tread upon it,\nfirewood gatherers burn it—\nand if one were to return it to its basket,\nit would be deemed monstrous.\nNow, Master, you take the **straw dog** of the ancient kings—\nthis is not far from being trampled by passersby,\nburned by firewood gatherers!\"\n\n*Wenzi* attributes to Laozi:\n\n\"The **Dao of Heaven and Earth** rules through **virtue**,\nthe **Way** commands it,\nand things **self-regulate**.\nIts subtlety within is such that it does not **elevate through deeds**.\nThus, it **stands established without awaiting merit**,\n**holds honor without relying on rank**,\n**shines without needing fame**,\n**maintains dignity without formal rites**,\n**strengthens without wielding arms**.\nThus, the **Way stands firm yet does not instruct**,\n**illumination shines yet does not scrutinize**.\nThe **Way stands firm yet does not instruct**—\nit does not **usurp others’ abilities**.\n**Illumination shines yet does not scrutinize**—\nit does not **hinder their affairs**.\n\nThose who **teach the Way** act against **virtue**,\nharm **things**.\nThus, yin and yang, the four seasons,\nmetal, wood, water, fire, and earth—\nthough they share the **Way**, their **principles** differ,\nand all things, though they share **emotion**, differ in **form**.\nThe wise do not **teach one another**,\nthe capable do not **receive from one another**.\nThus, the Sage **enacts laws** to guide the people’s hearts,\nletting each **follow its natural course**.\nThus, the living **lack no virtue**,\nthe dead **hold no grievance**.\nHeaven and Earth are **not仁**—\nthey treat all things as **straw dogs**.\nThe Sage is **not仁**—\nhe treats the people as **straw dogs**.\n\n**Compassion, love, benevolence, and righteousness**—\nthese are the **narrow paths**.\nThe narrow leads to the vast yet **loses its way**,\nthe near leads far yet **falls into confusion**.\nThe Sage’s **Way** enters the vast without **losing its way**,\ntravels far without **falling into confusion**,\nconstantly **empty and self-guarding**—\nthis is the **ultimate**, called **Heaven’s virtue**.\n\nShitian says:\n\"Heaven and Earth are **not仁**—\nthey treat all things as **straw dogs**.\nThe Sage is **not仁**—\nhe treats the people as **straw dogs**.\nHeaven and Earth take **generating things** as their heart,\nyet are called **not仁**—why?\nHeaven and Earth **universally embrace** all things,\nyet **lack

emotion**.\n\n**Straw dog**—\nthe sacrificial object, as explained in *Zhuangzi*.\nTo treat all things as **straw dogs**—\ntheir flourishing and decay follow **time** alone.\nEach thing **returns to its own kind**;\nthe living **self-generate**, unaware of their source.\nThe Sage’s relation to the people—\nhe lets them **self-generate, self-nourish, self-act, self-rest**.\nSince all **lack

on Differences:**\nMaster Héshànggōng composed *The Chapter on Manifestation*.\nZhào Shí’ān composed *The Chapter on Nourishing the Sacred Root*.\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng’s Commentary:\nThe previous chapter clarified that excessive particularity leads to private bias—\npartiality makes universality difficult.\nThis chapter elucidates the utmost emptiness yet responsive—\nits responsiveness is inexhaustible.\n\nIt begins with the **Valley Spirit**,\nentrusting the spirit’s function to illuminate the Dao.\nNext, it speaks of the **Mysterious Female**,\ndistinguishing the primal source of mysterious operation.\nIt concludes with **endless subtlety**,\ndemonstrating that emptiness in response requires no labor.\n\nMaster Dù Guāngtíng said:\nThe **Spirit** is what lies beyond the measure of yin and yang.\n\nEmpty yet responsive,\nsensitive yet spontaneously harmonious.\n\nSome interpret **\"Valley Spirit\"** as **nourishment**—\nnourishing the spirit aligns with immortality.\nOthers explain it as **echoing response**—\nresponding to things like the inexhaustible spirit,\nthe Mysterious Female as inhaling and exhaling the primal harmony.\n\nRefining the spirit and qi,\nprolonging form and breath,\nharmonizing with Heaven and Earth’s numinous essence,\nendlessly enduring—\nthis is the Dao of longevity.\n\nZhang Chōngyìng said:\nBetween Heaven and Earth, each inhalation and exhalation\nis where the **refined essence-qi** circulates.\n\nThe nose receives yang and forms its image;\nthe mouth receives yin and forms its image.\nWithout mouth and nose, yin and yang’s essence-qi\ncould not ascend and descend, above and below,\nand the image could not manifest.\nThis chapter opens the insight of yin and yang’s ascent and descent.\n\n**The Valley Spirit does not die—**\nthis is called the **Mysterious Female**.\nThe **gate of the Mysterious Female**—\nthis is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nEndlessly preserved,\nits use requires no labor.\n\nMaster Héshànggōng said:\n**The Valley Spirit does not die.**\n*Valley* means **nourishment**—\nif humans nourish the spirit, they do not die.\nThe **Spirit** refers to the five viscera’s spirits:\nThe liver stores the **hun** (ethereal soul),\nthe lungs store the **pò** (corporeal soul),\nthe heart stores the **shén** (spirit),\nthe kidneys store the **jīng** (essence),\nthe spleen stores the **zhì** (will).\nWhen the five viscera are all injured, the five spirits depart—\nthis is called the **Mysterious Female**.\nIt speaks of the existence of non-death\nlying within the Mysterious Female.\n\n**Mysterious** is Heaven—\nin humans, it is the nose.\n**Female** is Earth—\nin humans, it is the mouth.\n\nHeaven nourishes humans with the five **qi**,\nentering through the nose, stored in the heart.\nThe five **qi**, pure and subtle,\nbecome the spirit’s clarity, intelligence, voice, and the five natures.\nIts **ghost** is called the **hun**.\nThe **hun** is masculine, governing entry and exit through the nose,\ncommuning with Heaven—\nthus, the nose is called **Mysterious**.\n\nEarth nourishes humans with the five **flavors**,\nentering through the mouth, stored in the stomach.\nThe five natures, coarse and debased,\nbecome the form, flesh, bones, blood, vessels, and six emotions.\nIts **ghost** is called the **pò**.\nThe **pò** is feminine, governing entry and exit through the mouth,\nharmonizing with Heaven and Earth—\nthus, it is called **Female**.\n\nThe **gate of the Mysterious Female**—\nthis is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.\n*Root* means **origin**—\nthe nose and mouth’s gate\nis where Heaven and Earth’s primal **qi** circulates.\n\nEndlessly preserved—\nthe inhalations, exhalations, and breathing\nshould be subtly endless,\nas if preserved yet nonexistent.\nIts use requires no labor—\nbreathing should always be relaxed,\nnever hasty or strained.\n\nMaster Wáng Fǔsì said:\n**The Valley Spirit does not die**—\nthe **Valley** is the central void, without grain,\nwithout form or shadow,\nwithout resistance or obstruction,\ndwelling low yet unmoving,\nguarding stillness without decay.\nThe **Valley** accomplishes its purpose unseen—\nthis is the utmost substance.\nDwelling low yet unnamed,\nit is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nEndlessly preserved,\nits use requires no labor.\nThe **gate** is where the Mysterious Female originates.\nTracing its origin to its extreme,\nit shares the same body—\nthus, it is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nIf one speaks of its preservation,\nits form is unseen.\nIf one speaks of its absence,\nall things arise from it—\nthus, it is endlessly preserved.\nWithout things, nothing is formed;\nused yet unlabored—\nhence, **\"its use requires no labor.\"**\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng said:\n**The Valley Spirit does not die.**\n*Valley* is the empty yet responsive.\n*Spirit* is the wondrous yet unfathomable.\n*Death* means **rest**.\nThe Valley’s response to sound\nis unknown in its mechanism—\nwhen stimulated, it responds like a spirit.\nThe spirit’s response never rests.\nTo illuminate the utmost Dao—\nemptiness generating things,\nwondrous operation beyond words—\nthus, the **Valley Spirit** is used as an analogy.\n\nThis is called the **Mysterious Female**.\n**Mysterious** means **deep**.\n**Female** means **mother**.\nThe Valley Spirit’s response is profound, subtle, and inexhaustible,\ncapable of mothering all things—\nthus, it is named the **Mysterious Female** to illuminate the great Dao’s nurturing power.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe **Valley Spirit** clarifies the spirit’s response to sound,\nlike the Dao’s response to things—\nstimulated, it responds like a spirit.\n*Spirit* is named for the unfathomable;\n*death* is defined by rest.\nThe unfathomable response never rests—\nthus, **\"The Valley Spirit does not die.\"**\n\n**Mysterious** means **deep**.\n**Female** means **mother**.\nThe Valley Spirit’s deep and subtle operation is difficult to explain,\nyet all things flourish through its nourishment—\nthus, it is called the **Mysterious Female**.\nThe **gate of the Mysterious Female**—\nthis is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.\nThe deep, subtle, and maternal operation\ngives birth to all things—\nthus, it is called the **gate**.\nHeaven and Earth, having form,\nrely on this primal endowment as their foundation.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe Mysterious Female’s operation—\nwhen stimulated, it responds, and things emerge—\nthus, it is called the **gate**.\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of formed things—\nwithout the Mysterious Female’s operation,\nthey would disperse and exhaust.\nThus, they rely on this primal endowment as their foundation—\nhence, **\"this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\"**\n*Root* means **foundation**.\nEndlessly preserved,\nits use requires no labor—\nthe Mysterious Female’s operation is subtly endless,\nits application effortless, requiring no exertion.\n\nMaster Dù Guāngtíng said:\n**The Valley Spirit does not die**—\nthe meaning of the **Valley Spirit** is **echoing response and nourishing the spirit**,\ndivided into three distinctions.\n\nThe First speaks of the Valley’s embrace of emptiness—\nwhen there is sound, it responds.\nThe Dao’s essence is formless—\ncultivate it, and you attain it.\n\nThe Second speaks of the spirit’s formlessness—\nwhen there is invocation, it attends.\nThe Dao’s manifestation is without image—\ncultivate it, and it endures forever.\n\nThe Third speaks of the echo in the Valley—\nwithout sound, it does not respond.\nThe Dao resides in the body—\nwithout cultivation, it does not manifest.\n\n\"Not dying\" does not mean the death of life and death,\nbut the death of rest.\nIf one says it is the cultivation of the body’s dissolution,\nthen it is the death of life and death.\n\nThe first is: nourishing the spirit brings eternal life and non-death,\nthe second is: echoing response without cessation—\nthis is the death of rest.\n\nThe Mysterious (玄) is Heaven—\nin humans, it is the nose.\nThe Female (牝) is Earth—\nin humans, it is the mouth.\n\nThe original and harmonious *qi*, the enlightened and luminous spirit,\nwithin the body, entering and exiting through nose and mouth,\nbreathing in response to nourish the body—\nthus, it is called the Valley Spirit.\n\nAgain, Heaven’s five *qi* enter through the nose,\ntheir spirit is called *hun*—\nascending, it communicates with Heaven.\nEarth’s five flavors enter through the mouth,\ntheir spirit is called *pò*—\ndescending, it communicates with Earth.\n\nSpeaking of nourishing *qi* makes one a companion of Heaven—\npracticed endlessly, one may attain eternal life,\nrefining *yin* with *yang*.\n\nEating flavors makes one a companion of Earth—\npracticed endlessly, it breeds illness and leads to death,\nrefining *yang* with *yin*.\n\nMaster Laozi commands nourishing the spirit and treasuring the form,\nabstaining from grains and eating *qi*—\nthis is the Dao of non-death,\nhence, **\"the Mysterious Female’s gate, the root of Heaven and Earth.\"**\n\nThe Mysterious Female’s gate—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIt is not only that humans rely on the Mysterious Female’s circulation of *qi*\nto attain eternal life.\nHeaven and Earth, vast as they are,\nalso require the Dao’s *qi* to circulate and nourish them,\nonly then can they remain pure and tranquil without change.\n\nAs the lower scripture says:\n*\"Heaven, without purity, would fear cleaving,*\n*Earth, without tranquility, would fear dispersing.*\nHeaven and Earth losing the Dao\nstill face the perils of collapse and dissipation—\nhow much more so for the human body,\nif it does not uphold the central and preserve the One!\"\n\nEndlessly preserved,\nits use requires no labor—\nHeaven and Earth rely on *qi* naturally,\nthus enduring forever.\nHuman breathing through nose and mouth\nshould be endlessly subtle and mysterious—\nas if existing yet not existing,\nnot to be forced with haste or exhaustion.\n\nThe Dao of governing the realm,\nwhen laws are enacted,\nshould balance severity with gentleness,\ngentleness with severity—\nfor if laws are too lenient, the people grow slack,\nif too harsh, the people are ruined.\nIf one governs the world with the Dao of purity and tranquility,\nand the people are spared laborious exertion,\nthen the common folk will be devoted,\ntheir blessings enduring and prolonged,\nendlessly preserved like melons, gourds, and *gu* plants—\nthus, it is said: *\"Endlessly preserved, its use requires no labor.\"*\n\nMaster Song Daojun said:\n*\"The Valley Spirit does not die.\"*\nWhat has form has flourishing and decline,\nwhat has measure has completion and ruin.\nForm and measure together bring life and death—\nthis is the principle of all things.\nThe Valley responds to all things yet remains ever empty,\nthe spirit transcends all things yet remains ever still.\nWithin the eternal truth,\nit is one with the Dao,\nnot clinging to form,\nnot falling into measure.\nGenerating life without end,\nlike the sun and moon—\neternally unceasing,\nlike the Great Bear—\neternally unerring.\nThus, it is said: *\"It does not die.\"*\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nAll things receive their mandate from the formless,\nyet take shape in the formed.\nThe Valley’s operation is without likeness,\nthe spirit’s essence is without boundary—\nthis is where all things receive their mandate.\nThe Mysterious is Heaven’s hue,\nthe Female is Earth’s kind—\nthis is where all things take shape.\nThe Valley Spirit illustrates the eternal Dao,\nthe Mysterious Female reveals the marvel of creation.\nThe Mysterious Female’s gate—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"All things have their source in birth, yet no one sees their root;\nthey emerge, yet no one sees their gate.\nOnly the sage sees them.\"*\nThus, it is said here:\n*\"The Mysterious Female’s gate—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\"*\nHeaven and Earth are the above and below of all things.\nThings and Heaven and Earth originally have no sequence—\nto clarify the great Dao’s order,\nHeaven and Earth come first, then all things.\nYet what Heaven and Earth emerge from is the Mysterious Female.\nWho before Heaven and Earth could see it?\nEndlessly preserved,\nits use requires no labor—\nfrom its own root, its own foundation,\neternally established since antiquity,\nlike fire’s transmission—\none does not know when it will end.\nThis is called *\"endlessly preserved.\"*\nVastly created by Heaven,\na single *qi* moving on its own,\nsuddenly transforming itself,\nentrusting all forms to proliferate—\n*Li* is easily understood,\n*Kun* is simply capable,\nnot achieved by force—\nwhat labor is there?\n\nMaster Wang Anshi said:\n*\"The Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\"*\nThe Valley is able to be empty,\nable to contain,\nable to be full,\nable to respond.\nWith these four virtues,\nunknown in their operation,\nthus it is called *spirit*.\nWith its spirit, it does not die—\nif it dies, it does not generate,\nnot generating, yet able to generate,\ngenerating yet unseen in its progress.\nThe Female takes the meaning of generating things,\ngenerating things yet unseen in its actions—\nthus it is called Mysterious.\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"The Great Polarity generates the Two Principles—\nthis too is the Mysterious Female.\"*\nThe Mysterious Female’s gate—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nIts gate is the origin from which Heaven and Earth are born.\nSpeaking of it as existing is like saying it exists—\nendlessly preserved,\nits use requires no labor.\n\"Endlessly\" refers to distant yet unbroken speech.\nThough Heaven’s Dao is endlessly preserved,\nthe sage employs it without exertion,\nall arising naturally.\nTruly, the sage uses the formless to govern the world’s forms,\nusing surplus to supplement the world’s deficiencies.\n\nMaster Su Yingbin said:\n*\"The Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\"*\nThe Valley, though empty, still has form and outline,\nthe spirit is empty and formless.\nEmpty and formless—\nhow could there be birth?\nHow could there be death?\nEven calling it the Valley Spirit speaks of its virtue—\n\nThis is called the Mysterious Female, speaking of its function.\nThe Mysterious Female gives birth to all things,\nyet it is called Mysterious—\nfor one sees its birth but not the means by which it births.\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female,\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female,\nspeaking of all things arising from it.\nThe root of Heaven and Earth,\nspeaking of Heaven and Earth arising from it.\n\nEndlessly preserved, yet used without labor.\n\"Endlessly\" refers to subtlety without cessation;\n\"as if it exists\" refers to existence without visibility.\nIf one can thus, though used all day,\nthere is no exhaustion.\n\nMaster Lü Jìfǔ said:\n*\"The Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\"*\nThe Valley is the form that can be seen,\nyet because it attains Oneness,\nit is empty yet able to fill.\nThe Spirit is formless,\nyet because it attains Oneness,\nit is tranquil yet able to respond with vitality.\nIf a person can guard the Center and attain Oneness,\nthen the form that can be seen—\nthe body—\ncan be made empty like the Valley,\nand the formless heart\ncan be made tranquil like the Spirit,\nthen the form and formless are united without death.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The body unites with the heart,\nthe heart unites with the qi,\nthe qi unites with the Spirit,\nthe Spirit unites with the Formless—\nthis is their teaching.\"*\nIf united, there is no death;\nif no death, then no birth;\nif no birth yet able to give birth,\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe Formless refers to the union of having and not having;\nThe Female refers to the ability to give birth endlessly.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female,\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Dao’s birth of Heaven and Earth\ncomes from this alone—\nthus it is said as such.\n\nEndlessly preserved, yet used without labor.\nIs it said to be lost?\nThen it is endlessly preserved yet never ceases.\nIs it said to exist?\nThen how could one see its existence?\nAs if it exists—\nif it is lost yet not ceasing,\nif it exists yet not visibly so,\nthen my use of it\nholds no concern for existence or loss—\nit is simply applied without reflection.\nWhere is there labor?\n\nMaster Lù Nóngshī said:\n*\"The Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\"*\nThe one who gives birth endlessly does not generate;\nthe one who kills life does not die.\nThe Valley Spirit,\nFormless yet containing and responding.\nThe Mysterious Female,\nMysterious yet embodying both female and male.\nThus it is said: The Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female,\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Mysterious Female,\nthis is the birth of Heaven and Earth.\nThe so-called gate of the Mysterious Female,\nits offspring arise from it yet cannot be seen—\nthus it is said.\n\nHence, Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Though there be birth, one cannot see its gate—\nthis is what is meant.\"*\n\nEndlessly preserved, yet used without labor.\nIt seems to exist yet also seems not to exist,\nit seems to be preserved yet also seems not to be preserved—\nits operation never ceases,\nits use never exerts itself,\nthus it is said: Endlessly preserved, yet used without labor.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Endless coming and going is called Communion\"*;\nZhuangzi says: *\"Continuously thus without pause is called Fate\"*;\nand Laozi says: *\"The Spirit’s vitality, if not ceaseless, would fear exhaustion.\"*\n\nTruly, endless coming and going without pause or exhaustion,\nthis is the Spirit alone—\nthus it is called \"endlessly preserved.\"\n\nThe Valley Spirit speaks of its function,\nthe Mysterious Female speaks of its essence.\n\nMaster Wáng Yuànzé said:\n*\"The Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\"*\nThe Valley responds yet never exhausts,\nthe Spirit transforms yet cannot be measured—\nall things receive their mandate from it,\nyet it never generates, never dies—\nthis is the Valley Spirit.\nSpeaking of the Spirit reaches its peak,\nyet adding \"Valley\" refers to its ability to be empty and full,\nand yet to contain and respond—\nbecause it is active yet never worn out,\nit is simply called \"does not die.\"\n\nThe Valley Spirit receives the mandate while the Mysterious Female embodies form—\nit itself becomes yin and yang to complete Heaven and Earth,\nyet originally it is one thing.\nIt begins from its reception of the mandate,\nthus called the Valley Spirit.\nFrom its embodiment of form,\nthus called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female,\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Mysterious Female,\nits essence is yin yet unified—\nwithin its essence, there are yin and yang called its gate,\ndifferent from a door.\nAll things arise from this gate yet cannot be seen,\nthus called the gate of the Mysterious Female.\n\nEndlessly preserved, yet used without labor.\n\"Endlessly\" refers to the Valley drawing and not ceasing—\nthis is called the Spirit.\nThe Mysterious Female gives birth endlessly yet is neither fixed as having nor not having—\nits use without labor is because movement brings forth more,\nwhere is there labor?\n\nMaster Liú Zhòngpíng said:\n*\"The Valley Spirit does not die, to its use without labor.\"*\nThe Valley is empty yet able to contain and respond.\nThe Formless is the gate of the Mysterious.\nThe Female is gentle, tranquil, and profound,\nhaving receptivity without depletion,\nhaving acceptance without emission.\nThe Valley and the Spirit never generate,\nnever die,\nyet it is said alone: \"The Valley Spirit does not die\"—\nfor if it does not die, then it does not generate,\nthis is clear.\n\nEndlessly preserved, yet used without labor.\nIt is said: \"Its use is as if it exists.\"\nIts use without labor is the use of non-use.\n\nMaster Liú Jùjì said:\n*\"The Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\"*\nThe Spirit as Spirit,\nits emptiness is unyielding,\nits response is inexhaustible,\nyet no trace can be seen—\nthus the Valley is used as a symbol,\nand it is called the Valley Spirit,\nbecause the Valley is empty yet responds.\n\nTruly, if there is birth, then there is no one who does not die,\nyet only the one who does not die can give birth—\ngiving birth yet never dying,\nthen it can give birth endlessly.\nThis is called the constant state of no desire.\nNo death is called the Spirit.\nGiving birth endlessly is called the Female,\nits essence is one.\nThus it is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe Female is the Mother.\nAdding the Formless makes it the Dao—\nlike *Formless Communion*, *Formless Oneness*, or *Formless Virtue*.\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female,\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Mysterious Female,\nits birth is its homeland—\nlike a gate.\nHeaven and Earth flow in form,\noriginating from the Mysterious Female—\nlike a root.\n\nOnly the constant state of no desire\ncan give birth yet not die,\nthus called the Formless Spirit.\nIf there is birth, there is a Mother,\nthus the Spirit is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nOnce born, it takes form,\nthus called the Mysterious Female as the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Formless is the Dao—\nthe Dao is Heaven and Earth.\n\nContinuous yet as if existing,\nusing it without effort.\n\nContinuous—\nthis describes unending birth.\nUnending birth,\nits thread of life seems to exist,\nyet in truth, it does not truly exist.\n\n*\"As if\"*—\nthis is not a proper affirmation of its existence,\nlike the silkworm becoming its cocoon,\nor the spider weaving its web—\nseparating them is endless,\nyet seeking them is fruitless.\n\nUsing it without exertion—\nthis refers to the Spirit’s use,\nnot the human’s use.\nIts reason for not laboring:\nemptiness and responsiveness.\n\nEarlier, it was specifically said that responsiveness exists,\nso how could there not be exertion?\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of the analogy of the *túshuò* [鐙鈐, stirrup-spring],\nthus next comes *Gu-Shen* [谷神, Grain-Spirit].\n\nThough this chapter speaks of the Dao’s ultimate principle,\nthe Spirit’s cultivation for the body is no different.\n\nFor when the essence is complete, the *qi* is complete,\nwhen the *qi* is complete, the Spirit is complete,\nand when the Spirit is complete,\nit neither dies nor is born.\n\nLiu Ji [刘骥] said:\n*\"Gu-Shen* does not die—\nthe Dao descends as *qi*,\n*qi* settles as the embryo,\nthe embryo condenses as the Spirit,\nand the Spirit ascends daily as the *Xian* [仙, Immortal]—\nthus the Dao is the method of cultivating life.\"\n\nFrom Formless to Form,\nForm is the *qi*-Mother.\n\nThe body is the Spirit’s dwelling,\nnurturing the body preserves the Spirit.\n\n*Qi* is the Spirit’s Mother,\nhaving *qi* sustains the child.\n\nThus the term *Qi-Mother*—\nthis is the true foundation of longevity.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"Gu-Shen* does not die,\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\"\n\nThe Mysterious Female—\nthis is *Gu-Shen* itself.\n\n*Gu-Shen* draws in *qi*,\nwhich descends to the Mysterious Female.\nExamining its origin,\nthe Mysterious Female precedes *Gu-Shen*,\nthen *Gu-Shen* follows.\n\nFor human life,\nfrom *Ren* [壬] to *Gui* [癸],\nthe two kidneys mark its beginning and end.\n\nYet in its function,\n*Gu-Shen* precedes the Mysterious Female—\nfor human breath originates from the two nostrils,\nwhile the *Dan-Tian* [丹田] receives it.\n\nThe *qi*, drawn continuously by *Gu-Shen*,\nnever fully dissipates,\nits use lies in the subtlest realm.\n\nWhen sustained long,\nthe *qi* rests in the Mysterious Female,\nno longer drawn from *Gu-Shen*—\nthis is *Tái-Xī* [胎息, Embryonic Breath].\n\nThe *qi* in the Mysterious Female,\nlike a child in the womb,\nrequires no external breathing—\nbreathing arises from within.\n\nThus its method begins with *continuous yet as if existing*,\nand ends with *breathing not external*—\nthis is the *Tái-Xian* [胎仙, Embryonic Immortality].\n\nSome say the nostrils are the Mysterious,\nthe mouth is the Female—\nnose inhales the pure,\nmouth exhales the impure.\n\nOthers say: *\"Closing the Earth-House [地户] reveals its presence in the nostrils,\nnot in the mouth.\"*\n\nAgain: *\"The mouth and nostrils are not the Mysterious Female,\nfor the Mysterious Female lies in the lower field [下田].\"*\n\nIndeed, it is not spoken of through its gates of entry and exit,\nbut divided by force alone.\n\n*Gu-Shen* is also called *Shen-Lú* [神庐, Spirit-Dwelling],\nthe Mysterious Female is also called *Dan-Tian* [丹田].\n\nThe *Huangting* [《黄庭》] says:\n*\"Breathing enters the Spirit-Dwelling through the field.\"*\n\nThe Classic says: *\"Gu-Shen* does not die,\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\"\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *Du-Ren Jing* [《度人经》] says:\n*\"Opening the Three Brightnesses [三景],\nthis is called the Heavenly Root.\"*\n\nThe Three Brightnesses—\nthese are the *Xuan-Yuan* [玄元, Dark Primordial] *Shi-Qi* [始气, Originating *Qi*].\n\nThis is called *Qi-Mother*—\nlater giving birth to Heaven and Earth,\narranged as the Three Celestial Marks [三辰],\nalso called Three Brightnesses,\ndue to their inner and outer nature.\n\nThe Mysterious Female is the inner *Gu-Shen*.\n\nThe *Yu* [御] commentary says:\n*\"Grain responds to all movement while remaining ever empty,\nthe Spirit marvels at all things while remaining ever still.\nThis is akin to earlier words on the *túshuò* [鐙鈐],\nwhich stays empty to await the *qi*—\nall such analogies illustrate the Dao’s grand essence.\"*\n\nIts foundation is that *Gu* [谷] contains the Spirit—\nthis is *emptiness* containing the Spirit,\nachieved through nurturing stillness,\nnot like the emptiness of a hollow grain.\n\nThe *Huangting* [《黄庭》] says:\n*\"Within emptiness, serene and tranquil—\nthe Spirit arises naturally.\"*\n\nFor the nature is the heart’s function,\nthe heart is the nature’s Spirit.\n\nMovement lies in the *ji* [机, mechanism],\nstillness is held by the *qi*.\n\nThe *Xi-Yi* [希夷, Rare and Exalted] symbol—\nthis is the Dao.\n\nThe Dao’s essence—\nthis is the *one* *qi* of Formless and Emptiness.\n\nThe *one* *qi*’s function—\nthis is nature.\n\nNature—\nthis is *Gu-Shen*.\n\nThe *one* *qi* at rest—\nthis is nature.\n\nWhen nature is still, all transformations are at peace.\n\nThe *one* *qi* in motion—\nthis is emotion.\n\nWhen nature moves, all transformations arise.\nThe Sage preserves the Original Spirit in the Celestial *Gu* [谷].\n\nThe Celestial *Gu*—\nthis is the space between emptiness and void,\nemptiness and void—\nthe realm of Formless and Emptiness.\n\nPure *qi* and pure nature—\nthe root of all transformations.\n\nThe *Zheng Yuan Jun* [正元君, Upright Primordial Lord] speaks in terms of palaces:\nthe *Gu* is called the Celestial *Gu*.\nThe Celestial *Gu*—\nthis is the *Niwan Palace* [泥丸宫].\n\nThe *Niwan Palace*—\nthis is the chamber of Formless and Emptiness.\n\nWhen a person preserves the Spirit,\nthe Five *Qi* naturally come to pay homage,\ndescending through the *Xuanpin* [玄牝, Mysterious Female].\n\nThe *Xuanpin*—\nthis is the path of Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent.\n\nThus observed,\none knows that the *one qi* flows upward and downward:\nin the Celestial *Gu*, it becomes *jinjing* [金精, Essence of Metal];\nin the *Xuanpin*, it becomes *yuye* [玉液, Jade Nectar].\n\nIt is also said:\nWhen the *Xuanpin* is firmly established at a hundred breaths,\nits *qi* passes through the *Lingguan* [灵关, Spirit Pass],\nstirring the *Tianguan* [天门, Heavenly Gate] above,\nand descending through the *Dihu* [地户, Earthly Portal] below—\nthis may be called the *Miaodao* [妙道, Marvelous Way].\n\nThe *Lingshu* [《灵枢》] states:\n*The Mysterious Female connects above to the Celestial Gu,*\n*and descends below to the Earthly Portal.*\n\nFrom cultivating *qi* to dwelling in *qi*,\nwhen more is taken in than expelled,\nthis appears in the *Zhen* [☳] hexagram;\nwhen more is expelled than taken in,\nthis appears in the *Li* [☲] hexagram.\nAt sunset, it is gathered—\nrefined by the *Qian* [☰] hexagram.\n\nThis is the daily method of scholars for gathering and taking.\n\nWhen *qi* is held without entering or exiting,\nthis is called *taixi* [胎息, Womb-Breathing].\nOne ascent, one descent—\nthis becomes the *Longhu* [龙虎, Dragon-Tiger].\n\nThis is another method of refining the elixir.\n\n*Qi* is one in essence,\nyet its methods differ—\nthus, the affairs of immortals and transcendent beings\ncannot be achieved by a single approach.\n\nThe *Taixi* theory relies on dwelling in *qi*;\nwhen the Spirit is present, it becomes the way of immortals and transcendent beings—\nthis can be verified.\n\n**Second Section: Clarifying the Mysterious Female**\n\nThe *Xuanpin* is spoken of:\nThe nose has two nostrils,\nwhich descend to the kidneys.\nThe kidneys have two gates—\n*Xuan* [玄, Mysterious] is yang,\n*Pin* [牝, Female] is yin.\nThe two kidneys are likewise.\n\nDaily practice lies in alternating left and right.\n\nNext, it returns to the original flow.\nThe gate of the *Xuanpin*—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *Yu Zhu* [御注, Imperial Annotation] cites the *Zhuangzi* [《庄子》]:\n*\"All things have their source of life, yet no one sees its root;\nthey have their place of emergence, yet no one sees its gate—\nonly the Sage can perceive this.\"*\n\nThis is profound speech.\n\nThe Dao in relation to Heaven and Earth,\nall things in relation to *Kan* [☵] and *Li* [☲]—\nlife arises on its own, transformations unfold on their own,\nnature is its own nature, fate is its own fate.\nWho is the root? Who is the gate?\nSpeaking in terms of *ziran* [自然, Self-So],\none does not know why it is so.\nSpeaking in terms of the True Sovereign,\nis there truly no gate, no root?\nYet only the Sage can perceive this.\n\nThose who do not see cannot enter through the gate,\nthose without a gate cannot recognize the root of life.\nThis matter lies in the *tianji* [天机, Heavenly Mechanism]—\nwho else but the Sage can partake in this?\n\nThus it is said:\nKnowing and refining it makes one a Sage.\n\nThe *Xuan* [玄] is the *one*;\nthe *Pin* [牝] is the *mother*.\nThe *one* arises from emptiness,\nthe *mother* unites through movement.\nSeeking yin is yang,\nreceiving yang is the mother.\nThe *one* does not await birth,\nyet birth arises on its own.\nThe mother does not await union,\nyet emotion is naturally stirred.\n\nThe *Yijing* [《易》] says:\n*\"Water flows to dampness,\nfire turns toward dryness,\nclouds follow the dragon,\nwind follows the tiger.\"*\nThis is an inevitable principle.\n\nThus, when *Kan* [☵] and *Li* [☲] unite at *hai* [亥, 11 PM],\none *yang* begins at *ren* [壬] in the northwest.\n\n*Ren* is yang-water,\nuniting with *ding* [丁]’s yin-fire to produce *bing* [丙].\n*Bing* is yang-fire,\nuniting with *xin* [辛]’s yin-metal to produce *geng* [庚].\n*Geng* is yang-metal,\nuniting with *yi* [乙]’s yin-wood to produce *jia* [甲].\n*Jia* is yang-wood,\nuniting with *ji* [己]’s yin-earth to produce *wu* [戊].\n*Wu* is yang-earth,\nuniting with *gui* [癸]’s yin-water to produce *ren* [壬].\nThis is the principle of husband and wife.\n\nHumans have two kidneys:\nleft is *chang* [场, field], right is *yin* [阴, darkness].\nLeft is the kidney, right is the *mingmen* [命门, Gate of Life].\nAt the inception of *ren* [壬],\nthe *mingmen* begins to form.\n\nOnly with the *mingmen* does the heart arise,\nthe heart generates blood—\nfollowing *ding* [丁] producing *bing* [丙].\nThe heart generates the lungs,\nthe lungs generate skin and hair—\nfollowing *xin* [辛] producing *geng* [庚].\nOnly with the lungs does the liver arise,\nthe liver governs sinews—\nfollowing *yi* [乙] producing *jia* [甲].\nOnly with the liver does the spleen arise,\nthe spleen generates flesh—\nfollowing *ji* [己] producing *wu* [戊].\nThe spleen generates the kidneys,\nthe kidneys generate bone marrow—\nfollowing *gui* [癸] producing *ren* [壬].\nWith the kidneys, they unite with the *mingmen* to form two.\n\nThus observed,\nfrom the *one qi* of Heaven’s Primordium as root,\nit is already established as *one*.\nHow could it lack a name?\nThe name is the mother of all things.\n\nIn *Qian* [☰], it begins and thrives.\nThe beginning is the *Yuan Shi* [元始, Primordial Origin],\ngoverning Heaven—\nthus one knows that *Qian* governs the Original *Qi*.\n\nExiting, it becomes yang;\nentering, it becomes yin.\nThis is how the *Gu Shen* [谷神] breathes,\nhow the *Xuanpin* collects and stores—\nall things receive their fate from this.\n\nHow could there be no root to take hold,\nno gate to emerge from?\nThose who seek to see it\nmust perceive it here.\n\nThus, from the *one qi* dividing into yin and yang,\nHeaven and Earth are thereby magnified.\nBeginning with *ren* [壬], it generates the Five Organs,\nthe human body is thereby completed.\n\nIn Heaven and Earth, there is something knowable—\nin the human body, the two *qi* ascend and descend,\nbreathing and sighing, merging in harmony.\nOnly those with profound insight can achieve this.\n\n**Third Section: Clarifying the Methods of Regulation and Mastery**\n\nSoft and enduring, as if preserved,\nyet used without exertion.\n\nThose who receive their fate from yin and yang\ncannot depart from the numbers of yin and yang,\nthose who entrust their form to life and death\ncannot escape the authority of life and death.\n\nIndeed, human life\nis endowed with fixed numbers—\nthis is the principle of Heaven and Earth.\nUsing numbers to govern people,\nif one uses numbers without knowing their limits,\nthen those who perish prematurely in mid-course exist.\nIf one obtains the numbers and transcends them beyond things,\nthen those who achieve longevity and immortality exist.\n\nWhat are these numbers?\nOne, three, five, seven, nine—\ntwo, four, six, eight, ten.\n\nFrom where do these numbers arise?\nThey originate from the *one qi* of the Yellow Palace’s Heavenly Primordium.\n\nThus, the human body follows the *one*;\nHeaven and Earth span eighty-four thousand *li* above and below.\nAt the two solstices’ intersection,\nthe operations of *Kan* [☵] and *Li* [☲] unfold.\nOne inhalation, the pulse travels three *cun*;\none exhalation, the pulse travels three *cun*.\nBetween inhalation and exhalation, the pulse travels six *cun*.\nIn one day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths—\nhalf yin, half yang.\nFrom *hai* [亥] to *si* [巳], the *yingqi* [营气, Nourishing Qi] travels\ntwenty-five degrees of yang,\ntwenty-five degrees of yin,\ntotaling twelve *shi* [时] and one hundred *ke* [刻] of water clock measurements.\n\nThe waxing and waning, the full and the empty—\nthus completing the yearly function,\nharmonizing the Five *Qi* [五气].\nDo not precede it with excess,\nnor follow it with deficiency,\nthen yin and yang will be balanced in due measure.\n\nIf balance is lost,\nthe Five *Qi* will stray and conflict,\nin Heaven becoming *victory and reversal* [胜复],\nin man disrupting the Five *Zàng* [五藏, visceral organs],\nand from this all diseases arise.\nThe art of its application lies in what can and cannot be done.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"Gentle and enduring as if it exists\"* [绵绵若存],\nfor *gentle and enduring* is the *one qi* [一气].\nDraw the *one qi* between the *Gǔshén* [谷神, Grain Spirit] and the *Xīngshén* [神, Vital Spirit],\nmaking it so subtle and weak\nthat its sound cannot be heard,\nits movement cannot be felt—\nseemingly nonexistent yet present,\nseemingly present yet imperceptible,\nthus it appears to exist.\n\nSo, the *Yíng* [营, Nourishing] and *Wèi* [卫, Defensive] *Qi* remain ever attuned,\nthe Six *Mài* [脉, pulses] do not overrun,\nthe ascent and descent of purity and turbidity\nnever lose their proper timing,\nand panting or breathing\nnever become violent.\n\nThe *Mèngzǐ* [《孟子》] says: *\"Hold firm to your resolve and do not exhaust your qi* [持其志无暴其气].\"\nThe *Kāngcāngzǐ* [《亢仓子》] says: *\"The body conforms to qi,\nqi conforms to the heart,\nthe heart conforms to the spirit,\nthe spirit conforms to the formless* [体合於气，气合於心，心合於神，神合於无].\"\nThe *Yùzhù* [御注] says: *\"From its own foundation and root,\nit has been thus from ancient times.*\nAs fire spreads,\none does not know its end.\"\n\nWhen qi conforms to the spirit,\nyin and yang cannot control life.\nThe *Yì* [《易》] says: *\"Yin and yang are unfathomable\"* [阴阳不测者是也].\nLife and death cannot be manipulated.\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* [《庄子》] says: *\"This is the 'life and death that are neither life nor death'* [彼为生杀非生杀者是也].\"\nAll this lies in not exerting oneself.\n\nBut those who dwell within Heaven and Earth,\nyet go against the yin-yang numbers,\nare those who cannot master qi.\nWhen external things seduce,\nthey are instead overtaken by qi—\nhow much more so by those called *thieves of vital essence* [盗机]?\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth endure eternally\nthrough this very principle.\nShào Ruòyú [邵若愚] says: *\"The Grain Spirit does not die—\nthis is the Dao of 'use it not to exhaustion'* [谷神不死至用之不勤].\"\nThe Grain is used to illustrate emptiness.\nEmptiness is the *Dao* [道].\nThe Spirit is the *one qi* of Dao’s transformation,\nthe 'having within the formless' [无中之有].\nThe formless emptiness has no shape;\nit is originally without birth,\nyet also without death.\nThus it is said: *\"The Grain Spirit does not die.\"*\n\nEmptiness is the root of all things,\ncalled *Xuan* [玄, Mysterious].\nThe Spirit is the origin of transformation,\ncalled *Pìn* [牝, Feminine].\nThe Grain Spirit is thus the *Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝].\nAll things issue from the *Mysterious Feminine*’s gate,\nthis is called *the root of life and Earth* [生天地根].\nTo observe the Grain Spirit as *gentle and enduring as if it exists* [绵绵若存],\nthose who practice it must make the spirit conform to emptiness,\nnot through strenuous effort or contrived technique,\nnor through cultivated skill or force.\n\nWáng Zhìrán [王志然] says: *\"The Grain Spirit does not die—\nthis is the Dao of 'use it not to exhaustion'* [谷神不死至用之不勤].\"\nThe *Mysterious Feminine* takes Heaven and Earth as its root,\nyet all things are born from it without revealing its root.\nThe *Yì* [《易》] uses *Qián* [乾, Heavenly] and *Kūn* [坤, Earthly] as its gate,\nyet all things emerge from it without revealing its gate.\nThose who perceive it must be *sages* [圣人].\n\nThe Classic says: *\"The Grain Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Feminine* [谷神不死，是谓玄牝].\"\nThe Grain embodies emptiness;\nemptiness can nourish the spirit,\nand the spirit remains ever-present,\nso it does not die.\n\nThe Dao of the Grain Spirit is wondrous beyond transmission.\nIt is explained thus: *\"This is the Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝].\"\n*Xuan* [玄] is the gate of the wondrous Dao.\n\nThe *Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝] is the root of Heaven and Earth,\nthe *having within the formless* [无中之有],\nthe *Feminine* [牝] is the embodiment of Earth’s principle.\nPenetrating the distinctions of day and night,\nexhausting the origins of yin and yang,\nfathoming the vital essence of life and death,\ncomprehending the transformations of birth and death—\nfollowing the *one qi* of creation,\nascending and descending without end,\nthe Grain is ever-emptying and receives its mandate from Heaven,\nthe Spirit is ever-quiescent and takes form from Earth.\nOne emergence brings forth life,\none withdrawal brings forth transformation—\nall things return to their natural source.\n\nIts source was never born,\nyet its means of birth are without origin;\nits source was never transformed,\nyet its means of transformation reach no destination.\nThis is what the *Zhuāngzǐ* [《庄子》] calls *\"never having died nor ever having been born\"* [未尝死而未尝生].\n\nThe *Lièzǐ* [《列子》] says:\nThere is the *born* [生生],\nthe *formed* [形形],\nthe *heard* [声声],\nthe *seen* [色色],\nthe *tasted* [味味].\nThe *born* that is born dies,\nyet the *born* that is born without end never ceases.\nThe *formed* that is formed is solid,\nyet the *formed* that is formed without substance never exists.\nThe *heard* that is heard is audible,\nyet the *heard* that is heard without sound never emits.\nThe *seen* that is seen is manifest,\nyet the *seen* that is seen without appearance never displays.\nThe *tasted* that is tasted is savored,\nyet the *tasted* that is tasted without flavor never presents.\n\nWithout knowing,\nwithout ability,\nwithout not knowing,\nwithout inability—\nwhat I desire to learn\nmust be the subtlety of *\"never ceasing, never existing, never emitting, never displaying, never presenting\"* [未尝终、未尝有、未尝发、未尝显、未尝呈].\n\nTo embody yin and yang,\nride the transformations,\nflank the sun and moon,\nembrace the cosmos—\nto ascend and play with the Creator,\nto descend and befriend the external,\nthe deathless, the endless—\nthis is the *Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝],\nthis is the *Grain Spirit* [谷神].\n\nTo seek neither death nor life\nfrom this is impossible.\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* [《庄子》] says:\n*\"When virtue is cultivated and returns to its original,\nthis is the Primordial True Person* [性修反德，德至同为初真人].\"\nTo rest in this state,\none’s breath becomes profound and deep,\ncalled *gentle and enduring as if it exists* [绵绵若存],\nthis is the Dao of *\"use it not to exhaustion\"* [用之不勤].\n\nAh! This Dao is very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice,\nyet few can know it,\nfew can practice it—\nwhy is this so?\nBecause those who study it\nhave not yet illuminated the profound roots of stillness and extremity,\nof entering death and returning to life.\n\nWhen subtlety is mastered here,\none can govern Heaven and Earth,\nstore all things,\nascend to the Great Brightness above,\nreach the utmost Yang’s origin,\nenter the Gate of Obscurity,\nattain the utmost Yin’s source.\n\nObtaining the traces of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang,\none then knows where the *Mysterious Feminine* and *Grain Spirit* reside.\n\nHuáng Màocái [黄茂材] says:\n*\"The Grain Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Feminine* [谷神不死，是谓玄牝].\"\nThe Grain embodies emptiness;\nemptiness can nourish the spirit,\nand the spirit remains ever-present,\nso it does not die.\n\nThe Dao of the Grain Spirit is wondrous beyond transmission—\nit is explained thus: *\"This is the Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝].\"\n*Xuan* [玄] is the gate of the wondrous Dao.\n\nThe Mysterious Feminine is the origin of all things.\nThe Gate of the Mysterious Feminine is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n*Xuan* [玄] is the Gate of the wondrous Dao,\n*Pin* [牝] is the origin of all things.\n\nSeeking it within myself,\nwhat substance is it, indeed?\nSeeking it and finding it impossible,\nthen seeking what gives birth to my body,\nwhat substance is that, indeed?\n\nHeaven and Earth and I all originate from the Mysterious Feminine;\nknowing what gives birth to my body,\none then knows the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"Deep-rooted and firm-founded,\nthe Dao of long life and enduring vision—\nthis is it.\"*\n\nContinuous as if ever-present,\nits use requires no effort.\n\"Continuous\" means successive.\n\"Continuous as if ever-present\"\nalso describes the Dao of the undying.\n\nThe superior scholar hears the Dao,\nand diligently practices it.\nNow, why is its use without effort?\nThe diligent have moments when they are not diligent,\nbut those who use it without effort\nare never not diligent—\nthis aligns with the Dao.\n\nThere is no greater diligence than this.\n\nChéng Tàizhī [程泰之] says:\n*\"The Grain Spirit does not die.\"*\nThe Master Lao had many allusions to the Grain,\nsaying: *\"Vast as the Valley, for its breadth,\"*\nand *\"The Valley receives One and is filled,\"*\nspeaking of its capacity to receive.\n*\"Be the Valley of the world,\"*\n*\"The rivers and seas can be kings of all the Valleys,\"*\nall praise its virtue of humility.\n\nYet this chapter uniquely reveals profound truths:\nthe Spirit, the undying,\nthe ever-present—\nits deepest meaning and practical application\nare not the same as other texts that merely liken the Grain.\n\nOther schools offer no further insight,\nonly saying that the Grain’s emptiness\nis indeed the Spirit,\nbut emptiness alone is insufficient.\nFollowing its undying nature,\nits ever-presence,\nand contemplating its essence,\none sees that emptiness alone\ncannot fully capture its description.\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng of the Tang [唐明皇] explained it thus:\n*\"It responds to sensation—\nits response is like the Spirit,\nfor it is the very meaning of sound producing echo.\"*\n\nOther schools, having followed the Emperor’s revelation,\nlater began to cite his interpretation\nas their own insight.\nBefore this, none had spoken of it.\n\nThe echo’s generation with form’s shadow\nshares the same principle.\nYet shadows cast by form are not identical—\nwhether by sun, moon, water, or fire,\nall things with light produce shadows.\nThus, if one seeks the origin of shadows,\nthey look to the sun and moon but find none,\nthen turn to water and fire,\nand the principle can be made clear.\n\nBut sound’s emergence differs.\nWhen released into the wild, it disperses;\nwhen striking the mountains, it is muffled.\nOnly the Grain—\nexteriorly curved, interiorly hollow—\nwhen sound enters it,\nresonates back and forth,\nand thus harmonizes to produce echo.\nTherefore, though Heaven is vast\nand all things are many,\nonly this Grain can produce echo from the void,\nand thus possess this Spirit.\n\nSwift or fine, long or short,\nmuch or little—\nit responds to sensation and generates,\neach instance resembling the original.\nIf not taken from this Grain,\nwhere else could one find the Spirit?\n\nOnly when one knows the Spirit belongs to this\ndoes it become undying and ever-present,\nand all can be deduced.\n\nIt was only when Dàchāng [大昌] grasped this principle\nthat he felt it was fitting yet dared not assert it deeply,\nuntil he encountered the *Listed Child* [列子] citing the Yellow Emperor’s words\nto elucidate the Master Lao’s teachings,\nand then he was firmly convinced beyond doubt.\n\nThe *Listed Child*’s words on transformation\nfully cite the Yellow Emperor’s original discourse on the Grain Spirit,\nto prove that the continuous generation and transformation\nis the Grain’s ability to be the Spirit,\nto be undying,\nto be ever-present—\nall are named by this.\n\nFurther, he explains that all things’ birth and death\ncome from entering and exiting the mechanism,\nand he cites the Yellow Emperor’s words to clarify:\n*\"Form moves but does not generate form—\nit generates shadow.\nSound moves but does not generate sound—\nit generates echo.\nThe Void moves but does not generate the Void—\nit generates the Having.\"*\n\nThe principle he aligns with\nis perfectly consistent with earlier teachings.\nThus, Dàchāng saw that the Yellow Emperor’s two meanings\nwere originally one chapter,\nbut the *Listed Child*’s phrasing\nhappened to diverge slightly,\nso he also split them into two.\n\nThe reader must combine their differing expressions\nto trace the underlying thread,\nand then clarity will emerge.\n\nAs for the Grain’s ability to be the Spirit,\nit can be deduced.\n\nWhen it is hollow,\nin the Dao it is the Void.\nWhen sound strikes it,\nit responds to sensation and thus has substance.\nThe Having moves and strikes the Void,\nthe Void receives and thus is hollow,\nso the Grain responds to sound and generates echo—\nthe image of generation without self-generation.\n\nWhen sound ceases and striking stops,\nthe Void remains void in perception,\nand the Spirit cannot always be the Spirit.\nIf there is further striking,\nits response is as before,\nand then one knows that transformation\ndoes not transform itself.\n\nThis is why it attains\nthe undying and the ever-present.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* [《易》] says:\n*\"Without thought,\nwithout action,\nquietly unmoving,\nresponsive and thus communicating—\nthis is Heaven’s way.\"*\n\nIts lack of thought and action,\nits quiet stillness,\nare the Grain’s image of Void without sensation.\nWhen sensation comes, it immediately responds,\nproducing echo and answering sound—\nthis is the unmeasurable Spirit.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* speaks of divination’s Spirit,\nsaying: *\"It is about to act,\nit is about to move—\nask it, and it will respond as if receiving a command,\nwith no distinction between near and far, deep or shallow,\nand thus one knows the coming thing.\"*\n\nDivination’s response as if receiving a command\nis the *Classic of Changes*’s sensation and communication.\nThus, it also borrows the metaphor of echo and response.\n\nThe Master Lao’s book stands alone,\nrefusing to be confused with the *Classic of Changes*,\nso though he extols this Grain’s Spirit greatly,\nhe does not directly imitate the *Classic of Changes*’s echo and response.\n\nYet in seeking its principle,\nthere is no difference.\n\nThe *Listed Child* truly had insight here,\ncombining the Yellow Emperor’s and Lao’s teachings\nto reveal their harmony,\nand then the principle became clear.\n\nThus, the Great Master [参] examined myriad principles [万理] and observed,\nyet held firm to his own insight [自主其见].\nHe said: *\"Beyond the Grain’s Spirit [谷], there is no echo [响],\nthen beyond the echo, there is also no Spirit [神].\"*\n\nThose who rigidly uphold a single void [一虚] as its meaning,\nwhen extended to its limit,\nLao’s words then speak of the *Unperishing* [不死],\nor of *storage* [若存],\nall lacking a final resting place [无归宿].\nTherefore, he did not dare to follow blindly.\n\nThe *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门],\nthis is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth* [天地根].\nAll that is termed *Origin* [元],\ntake the meaning of *profound, dark, and obscure* [窈深暗晦].\n*Origin-Virtue* [元德],\n*Origin-Sameness* [元同],\n*Origin-Viewing* [元览],\nand this *Mysterious Female* [玄牝],\nall belong to the four categories of *Virtue-Sameness* [德同] and *Viewing-Female* [览牝],\nalready touching upon the *existent* [有] and thus visible [可见].\nTherefore, beyond these four categories [四则之上],\nhe further deepens into the *obscure* [深晦],\nand thus adds *Origin* [元] to explore the *command* [命].\nIts *foundation* [宿],\nwhen elevated to its utmost,\nthe *Miracles of the Nonexistent* [无] are already profound.\n\nThen, discarding the label of *Nonexistent* [无],\nand solely designating it as *Mysterious* [玄],\nits *image* [象] can be imagined.\n\nThe *Female* [牝] is one who *responds without initiating* [应而不唱].\nThe Grain’s Spirit [谷] that *harbors the echo awaiting sound* [蕴响待声] is exactly this.\n\nIf *sound is not stirred* [声苟不感],\nthen the *echo never emerges* [响终不出],\nand thus it can be said to *not act before things* [不为物先].\n\nOnly those who are the *mighty and strong of the world* [天下之雄且强],\nalready knowing this,\nand yet can *bow to the Female* [自屈於牝],\nhave reached the utmost *void* [虚].\n\nAbove this *void* [虚],\nfurther adding *Origin* [元],\nthen the *transformations and changes* [变化] that arise,\nare the *source of Heaven and Earth’s birth* [生天生地].\n\nThus, the previous chapter says: *\"The Nameless* [无名] *is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.*\nAnd here, it speaks of the *Root of Heaven and Earth* [天地根].\nAll this is *probing the ultimate and commanding the initial* [探端命初],\nand knowing that the *Nonexistent’s response to stimulation* [无之受感而应]\nis the *foundation of all existence* [凡有]—\nit *grants the primal command* [命其宗] and *governs their emergence* [司其出].\n\nContinuous yet as if existing [绵绵若存],\nits use is not exhausted [用之不勤].\nWith *form and substance* [有形有质],\nit is *visible to the eye* [目可睹] and *graspable by the hand* [手可捉],\nso it is called *existing* [存]—\nif the Grain’s Spirit [谷] can *respond* [能应],\nthen it is said to *sequence things* [以为序],\nbut it is *indistinctly nonexistent* [漠乎其无有],\nor if it is said to *not exist* [不存],\nthen the *echo before ceases* [前响已绝],\nand the *sound after strikes* [后声再触],\nits response remains unchanged [其应如故].\nTherefore, it is spoken of as *existing yet indistinct* [若存].\n\n*Continuous* [绵绵] means merely *holding to connection without cessation* [相属而不绝].\nZhuangzi’s *threshold* [际] is exactly this.\nThe *threshold* is the *intersection of opposites* [两异之交].\nLet us clarify it with the *plainly seen* [易见] four seasons [四序]:\nwhen *spring’s season ends* [春之已季],\nit is the *summer’s season about to begin* [夏之欲孟].\nThe *space between the end and the beginning* [季孟之间] is the *threshold* [际].\nThere is an *end* [季], then there must be a *beginning* [孟],\nbut the *Origin-Qi* [元气] never *makes itself into end or beginning* [自为季孟].\nThus, the Listed Child’s words on *eternal return* [命往复]\nand saying that its *threshold cannot be exhausted* [际不可终] are correct.\n\nObserving from the *threshold* [际],\nwhat is now called *beginning* [孟]\nis the *substitution of what was once called end* [昔名为季].\nThe *beginning* arises [起], the *end* departs [去],\nand thus *summer follows spring’s departure* [夏应春往].\n\nOnly those who *establish eternal return to give birth and transform* [制往复以出生化],\nhave *no threshold and no end* [无际无终],\nand this is why they *remain everlasting* [常存].\nThis *everlasting existence* [存],\nthough *constant and never perishing* [常不亡],\nis *yet unseen* [不可得见],\nso it *continuously connects* [绵绵相属],\nas if existing yet *no sequence is apparent* [不见其序].\nTherefore, it is spoken of as *existing yet indistinct* [若存].\n\nIts *eternal birth and transformation* [生生化化],\nnever *ceasing or lingering* [无时或息, 无时或留],\nas if *laboring greatly* [甚劳],\nyet *with sequence in precedence and succession* [先后有序],\nthough there are *actions and functions* [有作用],\nthey do not *exhaust movement* [费运动].\n*Self-birth, self-transformation* [自生自化],\n*self-consumption, self-rest* [自消自息],\nthere is *no labor at all* [元无劳].\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"The interplay of yin and yang, the four seasons’ progression,\neach attains its order.*\n*Awaken! As if perishing yet existing,\neffulgent yet formless—its spirit,\nall things nurtured yet unaware.*\nThis is called the *Origin-Root* [本根].\nIs this not the *spirit that perishes not* [能神而不亡],\nas if *laboring yet truly not exhausted* [若劳而寔不勤]?\"\n\nDiscussing how the Listed Child’s *birth and transformation* [生化]\noriginate from Laozi’s *action and return* [作复],\nand Laozi’s *action and return*\noriginate from the *Classic of Changes’* *eclipse and growth* [消息],\nyet the *means by which they birth, transform, act, and return* [所以生化作复],\nall do not exceed the *advance and retreat of yin and yang* [阴阳之进退].\n\nWhen *yin retreats and yang advances* [阴退而阳进],\nit becomes *birth and action* [为生为作];\nwhen *yin ascends and yang descends* [阴升而阳降],\nit becomes *transformation and return* [为化为复].\nSpeaking of this *gradual advance and retreat* [进退之渐],\nit is *eclipse and growth* [消息].\n\nThis is what the *Classic of Changes* and Laozi *speak in common* [所同言],\nyet Laozi *constantly probes what the Classic does not fully reveal* [探夫《易》之所不肯尽],\nand having spoken of it,\nhe *transcends eclipse and growth to discuss existence and nonexistence* [越消息而言有无].\n\n*Existence and nonexistence* [有无] are again\nthe *mechanism governing eclipse and growth* [消息之机],\nyet not *confined to the cycles of eclipse and growth* [自囿於消息之数].\nThus, the *evidence of action and return* [作复之证] is the *straw-dog* [刍狗];\nthe *mechanism of eclipse and growth* [消息之机] is the *bellows-key* [橐钥];\nand the *source of birth and transformation* [生化之原] is the Grain’s Spirit [谷神].\nThis is the *distinction between shallow and deep* [浅深之辨].\n\nZhan Qiu Pu said:\n*\"The Grain’s Spirit perishes not—its use is not exhausted.*\nThe *Chapter of the Manifested* [成象] states that all things\nare *nurtured by the Grain’s Spirit and Qi* [谷养神气],\nthus *eternally born and unperishing* [生生不灭],\nthis is called *Heaven’s Mysterious Female as Yang* [天主阳为玄],\nand *Earth’s Mysterious Female as Yin* [地主阴为牝].\nThe *Mysterious Female* is the *gate through which all things are born and transformed* [品物生育之门],\nthis is called the *rooted in Heaven and Earth* [根於天地],\nand the *endless generation and manifestation of things* [生物成象无穷].\"\n\nZhang Chong Ying replied:\n*\"The Grain’s Spirit perishes not—its use is not exhausted.*\nI possess this body,\n*endowed with Heaven’s Qi* [禀天之气],\nand *containing Earth’s essence* [含地之精],\nthis is the *Spirit of the Five Viscera* [五脏之神].\nThe *nose* [鼻] is where *Qi’s ascent and descent* [气之升降] are hinged,\nthe *mouth* [口] is where *essence’s circulation* [精之运行] is linked.\n*Qi moves fifty-one times before resting* [气五十一动息],\nascending and descending through the *nose* [鼻].\n*Essence circulates seventy-four times in a moment* [精一刻凡七十四运],\ncirculating through the *mouth* [口].\nThus, the Grain’s Spirit [谷],\n*nourished by this essence and Qi* [得此精气所养],\n*perishes not* [不死],\nthis is why it is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝故].\n\nThe *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门],\nis the *nose as Heaven’s Qi’s gate* [鼻为天气之门],\nand the *mouth as Earth’s essence’s gate* [口为地精之门].\nIf *movement is constant* [运动有常],\nthen the *kidneys do not empty and the seas do not block* [肾不虚海不塞],\nand this is the *root of Heaven and Earth* [天地之所以根].\nIf one can *rest the essence and Qi* [息其精气],\n*continuously as normal* [绵绵如常],\nusing them *endlessly* [用之无穷],\nthen *longevity will be without end* [享年为无已].\nThis is the *law of male and female interplay* [男女通行之法],\nand it is imperative to *deliberate and nurture it* [详味而养之],\nthen one will *attain true humanity and sainthood* [成真入圣],\nall through this.\" [皆以之也。]\n\n「If not so, then *essence will be depleted and Qi will be exhausted* [精耗气亏],\nand the *Grain’s Spirit* [谷神] will have no nourishment to sustain it—\nthen the face will lack luster and vitality [颜无光采],\nand *Qi will transform into the Yang Male* [气化雄],\n*essence into the Yin Female* [精化雌],\n*Spirit into the Ghostly* [神化鬼],\nwhich is called the *Three Corpses* [三尸者也].\n\nHumans live in this world,\npossessing this wondrous *essence-Qi-Spirit* [此妙],\nyet cannot preserve and nurture it.\nAlas.\n\nZhang Lingying said:\n*\"Xuan* [玄] is Heaven’s domain, the Yang,\nand is the *Primordial Qi* [元气].\n*The Female* [牝] is Earth’s domain, the Yin,\nand is the *Primordial Essence* [元精].\nThe *Primordial Qi* [元气] ascends at the *Child Hour* [子时],\nthis is the *birth of one Yang* [一阳生也].\nFrom the *Kidney Palace* [肾宫], it flows through the *Left Path* [左道] into the *Five Zang Organs* [五脏],\nand at the *Maocheng Hour* [卯时] meets with *essence* in the abdomen,\nentering the *liver*—this is called the *Spring Yang Division* [春阳分也].\nBy the *Wucheng Hour* [巳时], it reaches the *Heavenly Gate* [天门],\nthe *nose as the gate for its entry and exit* [鼻为出入之门],\nand ascends to the *crown* [顶],\nuntil the *Wuhou* [午时], when it descends, residing in the *Right Path* [右道],\nentering the *bone networks* [骨络], then returning to the *Kidney Palace* [肾宫].\n\nThe *Primordial Essence* [元精] ascends and descends at the *Wuhou* [午时],\nthis is the *birth of one Yin* [一阴生也].\nFrom the *Command Essence* [命元], it flows through the *Right Path* [右道] into the *bone networks* [骨络],\nand at the *Yousheng Hour* [酉时] meets with *Qi* in the back,\nentering the *lung*—this is called the *Autumn Yin Division*

when it descends, residing in the *Left Path* [左道],\nentering the *Five Zang Organs* [五脏], then returning to the *Command Essence* [命元].\n\nWhen *essence ascends and Qi descends* [精与气一升一降],\nthe *Mysterious Female* [玄牝] interplays,\nneither depleted nor excessive [不亏不盈],\nthen the *Spirit dwells in Heaven’s Grain* [神居天谷],\nguarding and sustaining this form [守卫此形],\nand only then can one perceive the *method of regulating and attaining non-death* [调理不死之方].\n\nBai Yushan said:\n*\"The Grain’s Spirit does not perish\"* [谷神不死],\nthis is because the *heart is originally without aging and death* [此心本无老死].\nThis is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝],\nunified in this *One Dao* [同此一天].\nThe *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门]\nlies where the *mind’s movements arise* [念头动处].\n\nThis is called the *root of Heaven and Earth* [天地根],\nfor it is the *heart* [惟心].\nContinuously as if preserved [绵绵若存],\nit is simply *this* [只是如此].\nUsing it without strain [用之不勤],\nis to act *without effort* [无为而已].\n\nLiao Cuiran said:\n*\"The Grain’s Spirit does not perish\"* [谷神不死].\n*Empty Qi* [空气] within the body is the *mother of Spirit* [神之母],\nand the *mother and child mutually nourish* [子母相养],\nthus *form and Spirit attain longevity* [形神长生].\nThis is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝],\nthe *mother of all things* [万物之母].\nThe *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门]\nis the *gate of all transformations and marvels* [生生化化，众妙之门].\nThis is called the *root of Heaven and Earth* [天地根],\nthe *source of all phenomena* [万象之本].\nContinuously as if preserved [绵绵若存],\n*left and right find their origin* [左右逢原],\nthis is the *original face of suchness* [本来面目之为].\nUsing it without exertion [用之不动],\nit *circulates endlessly without pause* [周行不殆],\nextending through ancient and modern times [绵亘古今],\n*requiring no effort to consume* [不消用力].\n\nChen Biuxu said:\n*\"The Grain’s Spirit does not perish\"* [谷神不死]—this is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝].\nThe *Great Person* [大人] takes *Great Emptiness* [太虚] as the *Empty Grain* [空谷],\nand *Creation* [造化] as the *Supreme Spirit* [至神].\nThe *Empty Grain* and *Supreme Spirit* [空谷至神]\nare the *body and function of the Dao* [道之体用],\nhow could there be a principle of *perishing or not perishing* [有死乎不死之理]?\nMoreover, it is *deep and hidden* [深冥],\nand yet can *mother and nourish*—\nthus it is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝].\nSome say *Grain* [谷] symbolizes *Heaven and Earth* [天地],\nand *Spirit* [神] symbolizes the *Great Dao* [大道].\nBut those who speak of *Grain’s Spirit* as a metaphor for *mountains and valleys echoing in response*—\nis this not too trivial?\n\nFurthermore, if humans can *embrace openness without bounds* [怀豁无方],\naligning with the *Great Emptiness’s vastness* [法太虚之广],\nand *preserve the true and genuine Spirit* [存任神真],\ndrawing upon *Creation’s vitality* [资造化之灵],\nthen *form naturally harmonizes with the Dao* [自然形与道合],\nwhat is there to speak of *death* [何死之谓乎]?\nThus, one *flourishes in hidden cultivation* [冥然茂养],\nand *all things receive its blessings* [物受其赐也].」\n\n「Thus it is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝]. The *Master of the Yellow River* [河上公] in his *Commentary* [《章句》] explains that *Grain* [谷] refers to the *nourishing sound* [育], meaning *nourishment* [养]. When humans can *nourish their Spirit* [养神], then they do not *perish* [死].\n\nThe *Spirit* [神] here refers to the *Spirits of the Five Viscera* [五藏之神]:\n- the *Liver Spirit* [肝] harbors the *ethereal soul* [魂],\n- the *Lungs Spirit* [肺] harbors the *corporeal soul* [魄],\n- the *Heart Spirit* [心] harbors the *Spirit* [神],\n- the *Kidneys Spirit* [肾] harbors the *Essence* [精],\n- the *Spleen Spirit* [脾] harbors the *Will* [志].\n\nWhen humans can *cleanse and still their form within the Great Emptiness* [清静虚空], *nourishing their Spirit* [以养其神], and not be *defiled by the myriad desires* [不为诸欲所染], their *form remains whole and their Spirit intact* [使形完神全], and thus they do not *perish* [死]. But if one *entangles with emotions and lingers in indulgence* [触情耽滞], *disturbed by the myriad phenomena* [为诸境所乱], their *form decays and their Spirit departs* [使形残神去], then how can the *Dao* [道] be preserved?\n\nThe *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门] is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth* [天地根]. The *Great Emptiness* [太虚] and *Creation* [造化] are the means by which *all things enter and exit* [万类之以出入]. Since there is the name of *entry and exit* [出入], it is called the *Gate* [门]. Moreover, *Root* [根] means *origin* [元], and the *Gate* [之门] refers to the *two nostrils* [两鼻], which serve as the passage for the *Essential Qi of Heaven and Earth* [天地之元气] to circulate within the body.\n\nThe earlier statement that *Grain’s Spirit does not perish* [谷神不死] exhorts humans to *the principle of nourishing the Spirit* [养神之理], while this passage on the *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门] illustrates *the technique of refining the form* [炼形之术]. Thus, those who *perfectly nourish both form and Spirit* [形神俱妙] alone may *align with the Dao* [与道同].\n\nHumans possess both *form* [身] and *Spirit* [神], and thus they have *birth and death* [生有死]. With *birth and death* [生有死], one cannot speak of the *Dao* [道]. *Flowing and shifting without constancy* [流动无常], how can it be called *stillness* [静]? If one *empties their form and Spirit* [空其形神], *forgets the distinction between self and things* [忘其物我], then *their exit lacks a root* [出无根], and thus *the Qi does not gather to form life* [气聚不以为生]; *their entry lacks an orifice* [入无窍], and thus *the Qi does not disperse to cause death* [气散不以为死]. Without *life* [生] or *death* [死], this is the *Spirit of Grain* [谷神]. *Birth and death are without constancy* [生死无常], for they are but *floating and shifting things* [浮动之物]. *Deeply hidden and feminine stillness* [幽深雌静], *serene and unmoving* [湛然不动], is what is meant by the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝].\n\n*Continuous as if ever-present* [绵绵若存], yet *its use requires no exertion* [用之不勤]. *Continuous* [绵绵] describes its unending nature—this passage ties together the earlier teachings on *nourishing the Spirit and refining the form* [结上养神炼形之义].\n\nTo *nourish the Spirit* [养神] is to attain *profound subtlety and hidden stillness* [深妙冥极], *cleansing and emptiness* [清静虚空], *continuous as if ever-present* [绵绵若存], yet *responding to things without ceasing* [感物而起], *uninterrupted in time* [无有绝时].\n\nTo *refine the form* [炼形] is to *breathe in the harmonious Great Emptiness* [呼吸太和], *guide and connect the blood and Qi* [导接血气], *drink the elixir of the endless spring* [饮难终之泉], and *chew the herb of longevity* [咀延年之草], so that *their limbs and joints remain unobstructed* [使其支节通畅] and *they experience no exertion* [而不勤劳]. Only then can they *share the same root as Heaven and Earth* [与天地同根] and *enter the same gate as all marvels* [众妙共门].\n\n*Master Xie Tuonan* [谢图南] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is the *ineffable function’s non-exertion* [至用之不动]. The *Classic* [经] states: *Grain is filled by the One* [谷得一以盈], *Spirit is made agile by the One* [神得一以灵]; *Heaven and Earth possess this* [天地有之], and *humans also possess it* [人亦有之].\n\n*Master Chen Xiyi* [陈希夷] says: *Mountains fall from Heaven’s heights* [山自天之上而坠], so when one *observes the trigram *Kān* [艮] and its lines* [画], one knows *mountains originate from Heaven* [山自天来]. The *human head symbolizes Heaven’s apex* [人之首象天顶], called *Kunlun* [昆仑]. The *nose and mouth are the roots of mountains* [鼻口山根], and the *Spirit dwells between them* [神藏其间], thus it is called *Grain’s Spirit* [谷神], the *master of the body* [一身之主宰]. Indeed, it *never truly perishes* [实未尝死].\n\nThe *Mysterious Female* [玄牝] refers to the *Two Primordial Elements* [乾坤二元]. The *head* [首] is *Kān* [乾], the *abdomen* [腹] is *Kūn* [坤]; the *Qi of these two elements ascends and descends, circulating* [二元之气升降往来], called *Mysterious* [玄] when in *Kān* [乾], and *Feminine* [牝] when in *Kūn* [坤]. The *Mysterious Female* [玄牝] is the *Qi of the Two Primordial Elements* [二元之气], and the *Two Primordial Elements* [二元] are the *masters of Grain’s Spirit* [谷神之主].\n\n*Master Shao Kangjie’s* [邵康节] poem states:\n*\"One thing originally has a body, a body still has a Heaven and Earth\"* [一物元来有一身，一身还有一乾坤].\nThis is precisely what is meant.\n\nThe *Gate* [门] refers to the *two nostrils* [两鼻]. The *pure and tranquil Qi of Heaven and Earth* [天地清宁之气] enters through the *human nostrils* [自人之鼻], *circulating and permeating the body* [流布身中]. The *head* [乾首] and *abdomen* [坤腹] are both *nourished by this* [胥此养之], hence it is called the *Root* [根]. The *Qi’s continuous entry* [是气之入], *unending as if ever-present* [绵绵不绝若存], is *preserved by following its natural flow* [顺其自然而存之], requiring *no exertion* [不必劳力].\n\nThus it is said: *Its use requires no exertion* [用之不勤]. Some may *overclose their Qi* [过於闭其气], which is not only *without benefit* [非徒无益] but also *harmful* [而又害之]. Indeed, it has been discussed: *The Great Ultimate* [太极] *begins to differentiate* [肇分], and humans stand alongside Heaven and Earth as *the Three Talents* [三]. This is the *Dao of the Three Talents* [三才之道].\n\nThe *head* [首] is Heaven, the *abdomen* [腹] is Earth, and the *heart* [心] resides between them—*the Three Talents within the human body* [吾身之三才]. *Master Shao Kangjie’s* [康节] poem states:\n*\"Heaven divides Creation within the One, humans weave the loom from the heart’s apex\"* [天向一中分造化，人从心上起经纶].\nThe *heart* [心] resides between the *head* [首] and *abdomen* [腹], *weaving the threads of the above and below* [以弥纶上下], so that the *Mysterious Female ascends and descends* [使玄牝升降], the *Spirit and Qi circulate* [精神往来], and thus *the body may endure perpetually* [吾身可以常存矣].\n\nWhen *preservation and nourishment are profound* [存养既深] and *understanding and recognition are mature* [体认既熟], then *it appears vague and indistinct* [惚兮恍兮], yet *therein lies an image* [其中有象], *indistinct and vague* [恍兮惚兮], yet *therein lies a thing* [其中有物], *deep and hidden* [窈兮冥兮], yet *therein lies a precision* [其中有精]. These three may be *perceived* [可识].\n\n*It cannot be seen* [视之不见], thus it is called *Yí* [夷];\n*it cannot be heard* [听之不闻], thus it is called *Xī* [希];\n*it cannot be grasped* [搏之不得], thus it is called *Wēi* [微].\nThese three may be *imagined* [可想].\n\n*Know its masculine aspect* [知其雄], yet *hold to its feminine aspect* [守其雌];\n*know its white* [知其白], yet *hold to its black* [守其黑];\n*know its prosperity* [知其荣], yet *hold to its adversity* [守其辱].\nThese three may be *preserved* [可存].\n\nWhen one *reverses their gaze inward and inspects* [反观内察], *Heaven and Earth resemble oneself* [天地与我相似]. Is it not true that *The Spirit of Grain does not perish* [谷神不死], and *Master Lao* [老氏] does not *deceive me* [欺我]?\n\n*Master Lin Yinshi* [林鬳斋] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is the *ineffable function’s non-exertion* [至用之不勤]. This section arises from *one practice of cultivation and nourishment* [修养一项功夫之所自出]. *Master Lao’s* [老子] original intent, however, was not *exclusively for cultivation and nourishment* [却不专为修养].\n\n*Essence* [精] is *substantial* [实], *Spirit* [神] is *ethereal* [虚]. *Grain* [谷] refers to *the ethereal* [虚].」\n\nThe *Spirit of Grain* [谷神] is the *divine essence within the void* [虚中之神者也]. It is said that *human spirit emerges from the void* [人之神自虚中而出], hence it *endures perpetually without perishing* [故常存而不死].\n\n*Mysterious* [玄] is that which is *remote and boundless* [远而无极者也]. *Feminine* [牝] is that which is *void and unsubstantial* [虚而不实者也]. These two characters merely describe the *void* [虚].\n\n*Heaven and Earth* [天地] arise from this, hence it is called the *root* [根]. *Continuous* [绵绵] conveys the meaning of *unceasing, unbroken* [不已、不绝]. *As if existing* [若存] means *as if present, as if absent* [若有若无]. When applied within the *void and nothingness* [虚无之中], it *endures without labor* [不劳而常存], thus it is said: *void yet unyielding, in motion yet ever emerging* [虚而不屈，动而愈出].\n\n*Master Huì* [晦翁] says: *The most wondrous principle* [至妙之理] contains the *intent of eternal generation* [有生生之意存焉]. This passage is well-phrased, though its meaning leans toward *theories of nourishing life* [养生之论]. Though this chapter may be applied to *cultivation and nourishment* [修养], its original intent was not *exclusively for this purpose* [实不专主是].\n\n*Master Fàn Yīngyuán* [范应元] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is called *the Mysterious Feminine* [是谓玄牝]. *The Spirit of Grain* [谷神] is akin to *void luminosity* [犹言虚灵也]. *Not perishing* [不死] is akin to *boundlessness* [犹言无极也]. *The Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝] speaks of *that which generates all things yet remains unseen in its generation* [言其生物而不见其所以生也]. It is said: *void luminosity, boundlessness*—this is the *feminine principle of generation* [虚灵无极], which is unseen in its generation, hence it is called *mysterious* [玄]. *The Spirit of Grain* [谷神]—*Fù Yì* [傅奕] says it is *profound yet penetrating* [幽而通也].\n\n*Sīmǎ Wēngōng* [司马温公] says: *It is called Grain because it is centrally void* [中虚故曰谷], *it is called Spirit because it is unfathomable* [不测故曰神]. *Sū* [苏] says: *Grain is supremely void yet still retains form* [谷至虚而犹有形], *but the Spirit of Grain is void and formless* [谷神则虚而无形也]. If it is *void and formless*, how could there be *anything to die* [虚而无形尚无有生，安有死邪]? Calling it *the Spirit of Grain* [谷神] speaks of its *virtue* [言其德也]; calling it *the Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝] speaks of its *function* [言其功也]. The *Mysterious Feminine* generates all things yet *remains unseen in its generation* [牝生万物而谓之玄], how could one see its generation without seeing *how it generates* [焉见其生之而不见其所以生也]?\n\n*The Gate of the Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝之门] is called *the root of Heaven and Earth* [是谓天地根]. *Gate* [门] refers to *yin and yang* [指阴阳也]. It is said that *one opening, one closing*—*endless coming and going* [以其一辟一阖，往来不穷而言也]. *Yin and yang* [阴阳者] are spoken of in terms of *the Dao’s motion and stillness* [以道之动静而言也]. When in motion, it is called *yang* [动而曰阳]; when motion reaches its extreme and stillness ensues, it is called *yin* [动极而静曰阴]. Motion reaching its extreme turns to stillness, stillness reaching its extreme turns back to motion—*opening and closing without error* [动极而静，静极复动，开阖不忒], *generation and nurture without end* [生育无穷]. *Root* [根] means *Heaven and Earth originate from this* [谓天地本於此也].\n\nIf a person *first attains this in their heart* [人能於此心之初得之], they will know that *the root of Heaven and Earth is a root without root* [天地之根，无根之根也]; *the Gate of the Mysterious Feminine is a gate without gate* [玄牝之门，无门之门也]; *the Spirit of Grain is a spirit without spirit* [谷神，不神之神也]. How could it ever be exhausted?\n\n*Continuous, as if existing* [绵绵若存], *used without exertion* [用之不勤]. It is said that *the Spirit of Grain in Heaven and Earth is continuous and boundless* [谓谷神之在天地，绵绵密密而无极也]. Yet *it cannot be seen when viewed* [然视之不可见], *cannot be heard when listened to* [听之不得闻], *cannot be exhausted when used* [用之不可既], hence it is said: *as if existing*—*Heaven and Earth use it, and the four seasons proceed, all things flourish, yet they never labor* [故曰若存，天地用之而四时行、百物生，未尝劳也]. The *Spirit of Grain in humans* [谷神在人] is likewise.\n\n*Continuous and boundless* [绵绵密密], *eternally generating* [生生无穷], *as its origin*—who could claim dominion over this body? *As its origin*—where could it ultimately reside? Hence it is said: *as if existing* [故曰若存]. Those who *skillfully use it* [善用之者] *never labor* [未尝劳也], how could it ever be exhausted? This chapter should be *profoundly understood* [宜深体之]. Some may interpret it *exclusively for cultivation and nourishment* [或有专就修养上解者], yet one must *first recognize the Spirit of Grain* [然必须认得谷神方可].\n\n*Xuē Yōngzhāi* [薛庸斋] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is called *the root of Heaven and Earth* [至是谓天地根]. *Grain* [谷] is where *the spirit resides* [神所居]. *Spirit* [神] is what *the form carries* [形所载]. *Nourishing the form to vitalize the qi, containing the qi to harbor the spirit*—this is the *Way of non-perishing* [以形养气，以气含神，不死之道也]. *Spirit inherently does not perish* [神本无死], yet when *assigned to form, it has death* [赋于形而有死], though even in death it *has not truly died* [虽死而未尝死也]. The *Spirit of Grain* [谷神] *does not perish because of the Mysterious Feminine* [因玄牝不死], and *Heaven and Earth take the Mysterious Feminine as their root* [天地以玄牝为根].\n\n*The Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝] is *internal* [内焉], yet *harbors essence externally* [而藏精外焉], *adjusting breath*—*one opening, one closing* [而调息一开一阖], *one exhalation, one inhalation* [一呼一吸]. Exhaling reaches *the deep root* [呼则至於深根], inhaling reaches *the firm base* [吸则至於固蒂]. Thus *the spirit enters* [于是有神入焉], *revolving through the Dipper* [离斗辗历天廷], *riding the sun and moon, parting clouds and mists* [骑日月披云雾], *soaring and returning to the Hall of Great Possession* [腾腾乎会归于大有之室], much like the *divine beings dwelling on Mount Gūshè* [亦犹姑射山有神人居焉].\n\n*Continuous, as if existing* [绵绵若存], *used without exertion* [用之不勤]. *Continuous* [绵绵] means *adjusting breath as if present, as if absent* [调息似有若无], *its use requires no labor* [用之要不至勤劳尔].\n\n*Xiū Xiū’ān* [休休庵] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—*used without exertion* [至用之不勤]. *Void and luminous* [虚明] is called *Grain* [谓之谷], *subtle and wondrous* [灵妙] is called *Spirit* [谓之神]. *Void, luminous, subtle, and wondrous without end* [虚明灵妙无穷] is called *not perishing* [谓之不死], which is the *Mysterious Feminine* [即玄牝也]. *Mysterious* [玄] is the *Great Dao* [大道也]. *Feminine* [牝] is the *Mother* [母也]. *One vital breath* [一气] *generates within the void and luminosity* [生於虚明之中], then *clears and turbid divide to establish Heaven and Earth* [然后分清浊立天地], hence it is said: *The Gate of the Mysterious Feminine is the root of Heaven and Earth* [故云玄牝之门，是谓天地根].\n\n*The wondrous Dao acts without action* [妙道无为], *one vital breath runs unceasingly* [一气运行不绝], hence it is called *continuous, as if existing* [是谓绵绵若存]. *Responding to the times, adapting to circumstances* [应时应机], *benefiting life and aiding all things* [利生济物], *accomplished without labor* [不劳而办], hence it is said: *not exerting* [故云不劝].\n\n*Void, luminous, subtle, and wondrous* [虚明灵妙] in humans is called *heart* [在人曰心]. The *heart is sovereign over all phenomena* [心为万法王], capable of *generating Heaven and Earth, running the sun and moon* [能生育天地，运行日月], *wondrous mechanisms and marvelous functions* [玄机妙用], *effortlessly boundless* [任运无穷], *responding to circumstances and sensations* [随缘应感], *accomplished without labor* [不劳而办]. Those who *awaken and clarify* [悟明者] *understand without being told* [不言而知已].\n\n*Zhù Bóxìu* [褚伯秀] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—*used without exertion* [谷神不死至用之不勤]. *Grain is void yet responsive* [谷虚而善应], *Spirit is luminous yet boundless* [神灵而无方]. If a person *harbors the most luminous essence within the most void place* [人能以至灵之物藏至虚之所], then *they respond to sensations without trace* [则随感而应]. *Response leaves no mark* [应已无迹], *life does not even know its own generation* [生尚不知], *how could death exist* [死乎何有]?\n\n*Mysterious* [玄] refers to *the Dao’s profound, unfathomable nature* [道妙难测], *Feminine* [牝] is *the realm of transformation and nurturing* [化育之地]. Its *function* [其为用也] *is wondrous in generating all things yet eternally generates* [妙万物而能生生], hence it is called *not perishing* [是之谓不死].\n\nThis elucidates *the Way of void-hearted spirit-nourishment* [此发明虚心养神之道], borrowing *Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation* [借天地造化为言], beginning with *void-heartedness and yielding to transformation* [始於虚心而任化], ending with *effortless self-transformation* [终於无心而化自己出]. All things’ generation *originates from this* [凡物之生，本莫不由斯], hence it is called *Gate* [故称门焉].\n\n*Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] says: *The Heavenly Gate* [天门者]—*there is no such thing* [无有也]—*all things emerge from non-being* [二万物出於无有]. In terms of the *Yì* [《易》], this is the *Tàijí* [太极]; in terms of humans, this is *nature* [以人言即性].\n\nThe beginning is the *one source* [一化] *awaiting transformation*, the *gathering place of myriad principles and myriad things* [万理众甫之都会].\n\nIf each person possesses it fully yet ignores its pursuit, then *the Valley* [谷] *is not truly the Valley*, *the Spirit* [神] *does not manifest itself as Spirit*—how can one relate to Heaven and Earth, to all things?\n\nThe *form* [形] *nourishes life*, *the contained qi* [含气] *nourishes life*, and *the primordial spirit* [元神] *nourishes life*.\nWhen these three are regulated and abide, the *Dao flourishes* [生道昌].\nWithin the body, the *Void-hearted Mother* [身中玄牝] is seen.\n\nContinuously guarding it without loss,\nlike preserving something in the realm of *faint and elusive* [恍惚],\nthen what movement could there be?\n\nThis chapter’s words are *concise yet profound* [语简意深],\nakin to *Mencius* [孟子] discussing the *浩然* [浩然] *qi of righteousness*—\nit manifests only after cultivation within the person,\npermeating the body as the *Dao itself*.\nThose who awaken grasp it naturally;\nit cannot be fully exhausted by mere words.\n\nEarlier masters, discussing *Dao* from beyond the orthodox [方外],\noften elaborated its *refined essence* [精] yet neglected its *coarse manifestations* [粗],\nachieving *transcendence* [上达] but lacking *foundational study* [下学].\n\n*Huǐnyuán* [混元] placed this chapter after *Beauty and Evil, Virtue and Wealth, and the Keys to the Mysteries* [美恶贤货橐钥],\nunifying them without separation,\nbut its language is *profoundly abstruse* [玄奥],\nso scholars fear its *height and distance* [高远] and dare not approach it directly.\n\nNow, without heeding my own *shallow inadequacy* [浅陋],\nI presume to sketch beyond the shadow—\n*the Valley-Spirit* [谷神] *is akin to the Non-ultimate* [无极],\nthe *Void-hearted Mother* [玄牝] *is akin to the Tàijí* [太极].\nThe *continuous method* [绵绵] *mirrors the Tàijí’s* [太极] *pervasive diffusion* [氤氲布化],\ngiving rise to an unceasing *Dao* [生道不息].\n\n*The Valley* [谷] refers to its *substance* [体],\nthe *Void-hearted Mother* [玄牝] to its *transformation* [化],\nand *continuous* [绵绵] to its *application* [用].\nIf one can *inwardly seek it within oneself* [反求诸身],\nthen self-transformation is achieved.\n\nThe *root of Heaven and Earth* [天地之根] is *implied without words* [不言而喻].\nIn the present age, those who practice *life-nourishment* [养生家],\ntheir teachings also center on *Valley-Spirit and Void-hearted Mother* [谷神玄牝],\nyet they fixate on *physical form and material essence* [形质],\nextracting it from the *kidneys and heart* [心肾], or from *breathing through mouth and nose* [口鼻呼吸].\nThese are but *later Heaven’s crude residues* [土苴] after all.\n\nAs for the *root of Heaven and Earth* [天地之根] and the *origin of myriad things* [万物宗],\nthey are abandoned and not explored—\nhow can they illuminate the *wondrous essence of Valley-Spirit* [谷神之妙]?\n\nAccording to *The Liezi* [《列子》], it cites *The Yellow Emperor’s Book* [《黄帝书》],\nwhich preserves this chapter entirely.\nEvidently, these words existed in antiquity,\nand *Huǐnyuán* [混元] merely *recounted them without original composition* [述而不作].\n\n*Niú Miào* [牛妙]’s transmission states:\n*The Valley-Spirit does not perish* [谷神不死], hence it is called *Void-hearted Mother* [玄牝].\n*The Valley* [谷] is *nourishment* [养].\n*Spirit* [神] is one of the *three highest elixirs* [上药三品] in the *Daoist canon*.\n*The Void-hearted Mother* [玄牝] refers to the *two nostrils* [鼻之左右孔].\n\nThus, *great cultivators* [大修行人] practice the *method of fetal breathing* [胎息法],\nfrom *external Void-hearted Mother* [外玄牝] to *internal Void-hearted Mother* [内玄牝],\nguiding and drawing the *true qi of Supreme Harmony* [太和真气],\nfocusing intent on the *elixir field* [丹田].\nWith prolonged practice,\ntheir bodies endure eternally—\nhence it is said, *the Valley-Spirit does not perish* [谷神不死].\n\n*The Jade Purity Fetal Essence Inner Nourishment Classic* [《玉清胎元内养经》] states:\n*The wondrous Dao of the Fetal Essence* [胎元妙道],\nuniting *external Void-hearted Mother* [外玄牝] with *internal Void-hearted Mother* [内玄牝],\nsupplementing *external true spirit* [外真神] with *internal true qi* [内真气],\ngathering *Heaven’s myriad treasures* [天之万宝] and *my own fetal essence* [我胎之元精],\nso that *spirit is born from the fetus* [神生於胎],\n*qi clings to the spirit* [气恋於神],\nthe *heart-sovereign* [心君] *governs in concealment* [潜御],\n*breathing is smooth and even* [气息调匀],\n*continuous as if preserved yet never ceasing* [绵绵若存而不息],\n*endless in its application yet manifesting its efficacy* [用之不穷而见功].\n*The Valley-Spirit does not perish* [谷神不死] is the *union with my true origin* [合我真宗].\nThis is the meaning.\n\nThe **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—this is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nNow, the discourse on the Mysterious Female has **inner and outer** aspects. The **outer** has already been explained above; the **inner** is a **mouth-to-mouth transmitted** secret, not recorded in texts. Thus, Zhang Pingzhong’s *Awakening to the True* [《悟真篇》] states:\n\n*The Mysterious Female*—\nnot the heart, not the kidneys,\nnot the liver, not the lungs,\nnot the spleen, not the Triple Burner,\nnot the bladder, not the elixir field [丹田].\n\nThen what is it?\nIt is further said:\n*The True Mysterious Female, the Mysterious True Female*—\nall converge at a single orifice.\n\nYet this profound principle,\nwithout an enlightened teacher, is difficult to know.\n\nI once read the *Daoist Canon on Cultivation* [《道藏修行论》], which states:\n*The Mysterious Female resides between the two kidneys,*\ncalled the **Divine Chamber**—\nthe **Palace where the Spirit-Sovereigns assemble**,\nthe **Region where essence and qi intermingle**,\nthe **Gate of Life**—\nthus called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nFor the human body is a **miniature Heaven and Earth**.\n\nContinuous as if preserved yet never ceasing—\nthis speaks of the **Fetal Breath cultivation method**:\nneither strained nor slack,\nas if present yet as if absent,\nletting the nasal breath flow gently in and out,\nwithout forcing it.\nThus it is said: *its use requires no effort* [用之不勤].\n\nThe *Jade Emperor’s Heart-Seal Scripture* [《玉帝心印经》] states:\n*The three supreme elixirs*—\n**Spirit, Qi, and Essence**.\nVague and indistinct,\ndim and obscure,\npreserved yet not held,\ninstantly perfected.\n\nThe **cyclic winds merge**—\nin a hundred days, the **Spirit becomes luminous**.\nEntering and exiting the **Mysterious Female**,\nas if absent yet as if present,\nendlessly unbroken,\nfirmly rooted—\neach person has their **essence**,\nand when essence is perfected, **spirit is born**.\n\nWhen spirit unites with **qi**, and **qi unites with the body’s true nature**,\nspirit depends on qi to manifest,\nessence depends on qi to flourish.\nWhen gathered, it exists;\nwhen scattered, it dissipates.\n\nThe three elixirs share one principle—\nwondrous beyond words.\nObtain it once, and it is eternal—\nnaturally, the body becomes light.\nThe **Great Harmony** overflows,\nbones transmute into **frosted jade**.\n\nThis is the meaning.\n\nYang Zhiren says:\n*From \"Valley-Spirit does not perish\" to \"its use requires no effort.\"*\nThe **Valley-Spirit**—\nthis is the **Heavenly Primordial Spirit** [天谷元神].\nAt the **Hun-Dong’s** [鸿蒙] initial division,\nthis spirit existed first.\nIt shares substance with the **Great Void**,\nand is born with Heaven and Earth.\nWhen the spirit arrives, life begins;\nwhen the spirit departs, death comes.\nYet life is never truly born,\nand death is never truly death.\n\nIt is the **Sovereign of Yin and Yang**,\nthe **Exalted Lord of all Spirits**.\nProfound and vast—\nwithout it, the sun and moon cannot shine,\nwithout it, the Five Phases cannot flourish,\nwithout it, all things cannot grow.\nIts immortality lies in the **Mysterious Female**.\n\n*Mysterious* is **True Yang**,\n*Female* is **True Yin**.\nAbove, it connects to Heaven;\nbelow, it coils within Earth,\ncirculating through the **Six Voids**,\nwithout fixed abode above or below.\n\nIn the elixir, it is **True Lead and Mercury** [真铅汞];\nin the *I Ching*, it is **Kan and Li** [坎离];\nin the symbols, it is **Dragon and Tiger**.\nWhen a person cultivates it,\nKan and Li wax and wane within the body,\nwinds and clouds surge through the **Seven Orifices**,\ntrue *qi* steams and warms without cold or heat,\npure Yang flows and nourishes without birth or death—\nthis is the **function of the Mysterious Female**.\n\nMoreover, the **Gate**—\nthis is the **portal of the sun and moon**.\nNot the heart or kidneys,\nnot the mouth or nose,\nnot the **Cinnabar Field** [泥丸],\nnot the **elixir field below the navel**,\nnot the **one-inch circular orifice within the navel**,\nnot the **double gate between the shoulder blades**,\nnot the **orifice above the heart**,\nnor is it a matter of **closing the breath and forcing it**—\nto fixate on these is utterly mistaken.\nWhy not return to the **Root of Heaven and Earth**?\n\nThe *I Ching* says:\n*The still and unmoving is sincerity* [诚],\n*responding and thus communicating is spirit*—\nthis is the **Gate of the Mysterious Female**.\n*The movement before form takes shape is the subtle*—\nthis is the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nSincerity is refined, thus clear;\nspirit responds, thus wondrous;\nthe subtle is profound, thus mysterious.\nSincerity and subtlety—this is **sagacity**.\n\nContinuous as if preserved yet never ceasing—\nits use requires no effort.\n\nJù Qīngzhōng says:\n*From \"Valley-Spirit does not perish\" to \"its use requires no effort.\"*\n\nThe *Book of Laozi* treats **governance and benevolence**,\n**cultivating the heart and nurturing nature**,\n**breath-work and spirit-refining**—\nboth coarse and subtle, beginning and end,\nall encompassed.\nThis chapter primarily concerns **cultivation and nourishment**,\nand should be harmonized with **Confucian and Daoist texts** for mutual elucidation.\n\nFrom the **Confucian perspective**:\n*Valley* means **emptiness**;\n*Spirit* means **the spirit within emptiness**.\n\nFrom the **Daoist perspective**:\n*Valley* is the **Heavenly Valley**;\n*Spirit* is the **Primordial Spirit of the body**.\nThe **Palace where the Primordial Spirit resides**—\nits emptiness is like a valley, yet the spirit dwells within—\nthus it is called **Valley-Spirit**, the **Cinnabar Field Palace** [泥丸宫].\nWhen the spirit is preserved, life continues;\nwhen the spirit departs, death comes.\nThe reason the **Valley-Spirit does not perish**\nlies in the **Mysterious Female**.\n\nThe **Yang Spirit** is *Mysterious*,\nthe **Yin Breath** is *Female*—\nwhen spirit and breath intermingle,\ntrue essence naturally forms.\nUniting with the **Way**, it enters **neither death nor birth**—\nthus: *Valley-Spirit does not perish*—\nthis is the **Mysterious Female**.\n\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Secret of Yin* [《黄帝阴符经》] states:\n*The mouth connects to the five viscera*—\nthe exhaled breath is **heavy and turbid**, belonging to **Yin**—\ncalled the **Earthly Root**.\n*The nose connects to the six bowels*—\nthe exhaled breath is **light and pure**, belonging to **Yang**—\ncalled the **Heavenly Root**.\nThe mouth and nose—\nthe **Yang Spirit and Yin Breath**—\nare the **passageways of their coming and going**,\nthus called the **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—\nthis is the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nThe Sage **directs this breath** during **ascent and descent**,\n**preserves and refines it** within **inhalation and exhalation**,\ncontinuously, without interruption.\nPreserve it by following its natural course—\nover time, the spirit naturally settles,\nthe breath naturally steadies.\nIt is never forced or hastened.\nThus it is said: *its use requires no effort*.\n\nThe **Confucian and Daoist texts** converge in principle.\nLiezi fully cites this chapter, attributing it to the Yellow Emperor,\nsuggesting Laozi’s words may have had an origin.\n\nSome say the human body contains **one orifice**—\nnot the mouth or nose,\nnot the heart or kidneys,\nnot the **Valley Passage** [谷道]—\nyet its essence is difficult to articulate.\nLet those who discuss the **Mysterious** deliberate further.\n\nXū Liùxū says:\n*Valley-Spirit does not perish*—\nthis is the **Mysterious Female**.\n\nThe **Valley** takes its emptiness—\nthe **Spirit’s** words are unfathomable.\n*\"Not dying\"* means it abides eternally.\n\nSpeaking of the emptiness within the **Valley**,\nwithin it resides the **Spirit**—\nunfathomable in yin and yang,\neternal from ancient times to now.\nThus it is said: *\"The Valley-Spirit does not die.\"*\n\nBecause it does not die,\nit is called the **Mysterious Female**.\n*\"Mysterious\"* means distant.\n*\"Female\"* means birth.\nIt speaks of the countless eons since antiquity,\nprofound and unfathomable,\nits principle of generation endless—\nthus it is called the **Mysterious Female**.\n\nThe **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—\nthis is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n*\"Gate\"* means passage and

requires no effort.\n*\"Continuous\"* means subtle yet unbroken—\nthe very body of the **Mysterious Female**.\n*\"No effort\"* is its function—\nthe **Gate of the Mysterious Female**,\nfrom antiquity to now,\nsubtle yet unbroken,\nthough unseen in sight,\nits wondrous generative power\nmanifests as if present—\nhow could it ever be said to labor?\n\nThis chapter, from beginning to end,\nspeaks only of the **Valley-Spirit**—\nthe Sage unfolds it thus, how marvelous!\nAh! This **Valley-Spirit**,\nfrom birth to old age,\nnever for a moment departs from man—\nits form, function,\ndiffer not in the slightest.\n\nThose who believe need no further force;\nthose who grasp it will depart.\nIf one speculates while alive,\nthe falcon has already passed beyond Silla.\n\nLi Shifu says:\nFrom *\"The Valley-Spirit does not die\"* to *\"its use requires no effort\"*—\n*\"The Valley-Spirit does not die\"* is called the **Mysterious Female**,\nfor the **Valley** is emptiness—\nthe great **Valley** of Heaven and Earth,\nthe small **Valleys** of mountains and marshes.\nThe **Spirit** is the numinous essence—\nthe **Spirit** abides in emptiness,\nborrowing *qi* to resonate.\nMountains and marshes, though lifeless,\nwhen called, respond with echoes.\nMy **Spirit** is formless,\nrelying on *qi* to sound—\nundying, eternally preserved.\n\n*\"Mysterious\"* is the subtle heart.\n*\"Female\"* is the intent of *qi*.\nBefore the heart’s use manifests,\nmen do not perceive it—*\"Mysterious.\"*\nBefore *qi* transforms,\nthe deed remains unseen—*\"Female.\"*\n\nThe **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—\nthis is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**—\nthe passage of giving and receiving,\nof release and return.\nFrom this single *qi*, the Dao is born;\nfrom this single heart, Heaven, Earth, and all things emerge—\nthe foundation of all affairs’ mechanisms.\n\nContinuous as if preserved,\nits use requires no effort—\nunbroken and eternal,\nunwaning.\nApply it gently, never forcing,\nlest the **Spirit** and *qi* be injured.\n\nChai Yuangao says:\n*\"The Valley-Spirit does not die\"*—\nthis is called the **Mysterious Female**.\nThe **Valley** is emptiness,\n*\"not dying\"* is perpetual wakefulness.\nWhen the myriad thoughts stir,\nthe root is revealed—\nwhen emptiness prevails, it revives.\n\nThe **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—\nthis is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\nThe opening and closing of *Kàn* and *Hūn*.\nContinuous as if preserved,\nits use requires no effort.\nThe **True Person’s** breath—\nresting on the heels, effortless.\nThe common man’s breath—\nthrough the throat, labored.\nThere must be action, yet\nthe mind must not be fixed,\nforget not,\nnor force growth—\nthis is the effortless use.\n\nIs it not the Gate of *Kàn* and *Hūn*?\n\nSu Jingjing says:\nFrom *\"The Valley-Spirit does not die\"* to *\"its use requires no effort\"*—\nthis chapter speaks of nurturing *qi*.\nThe Master of the Yellow River and Zhang Chong\nboth took the **Mysterious Female** as the nose and mouth—\nthe passage for inhaling and exhaling.\n*\"Root\"* means origin.\nThe nose and mouth are the passageways\nthrough which Heaven and Earth’s primal *qi* circulates.\nContinuous and unbroken,\nits subtlety is as if nonexistent yet present—\nwhen *qi* is nourished,\nits use requires no extra force,\nnaturally extending life and vision.\n\nEven the Tang Emperor Minghuang,\nwhen the **Valley** responded to sound,\nknew not how—\nwhen stimulated, it responded,\nas if divine.\nIn Laozi’s text, the **Valley** is used as metaphor repeatedly:\n*\"Vast, like the **Valley**,\"*\n*\"The **Valley** that holds One is full,\"*\n*\"Be the **Valley** of the world,\"*\n*\"The rivers and seas can be kings of the **Valleys**,\"*\nall because of their ability to descend.\nYet here it uniquely says:\n*\"The Valley-Spirit does not die,\"*\n*\"Continuous as if preserved.\"*\nIf one seeks it from its undying, as-if-preserved nature,\ndescending alone cannot exhaust it.\nOnly as the Emperor’s responsive echo\ncan the meaning of *\"not dying yet as-if-preserved\"* be fully grasped.\n\nEcho and shadow are one—\nshadows trace form,\nfrom the sun, moon, water, fire.\nBut sound’s resonance:\nwhen uttered in the wild, it scatters;\nwhen striking mountains, it is stifled.\nOnly when sound emerges from an empty **Valley**\ndoes it resonate as if from nothing—\ndivinely so.\nThen one knows that *\"not dying yet as-if-preserved\"*\nis truly without deceit.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said:\nWhen form moves, it does not generate form—\nit generates shadow.\nWhen sound moves, it does not generate sound—\nit generates resonance.\nWhen the void moves, it does not generate the void—\nit generates the existent.\n\nThus the **Valley’s** ability to manifest as **Spirit** is indeed verifiable.\nWhen it is empty, it is void;\nwhen sound strikes it, it responds—\nsensing, it manifests.\nThis sensing-response is its undying, as-if-preserved **Spirit**.\n\n*\"Mysterious\"* is subtlety.\n*\"Female\"* is responding without initiating.\nThe **Valley’s** storing of resonance awaiting sound—\nthis is *\"not initiating.\"*\nIf sound does not strike,\nthe resonance’s response never emerges;\nwhen sound strikes, the resonance responds.\nSo subtle is its **Spirit**—\nthus it is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nHeaven and Earth are born from the **Supreme Polarity**,\nthe **Supreme Polarity** originates from the void,\nthe void can generate the existent,\nthe existent is born from the void.\nResonance responds to sound—\nthe void generating the existent—\nif not called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**, why?\n\nThe previous chapter speaks of the *Nameless*,\nthe beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThis speaks of the **Root of Heaven and Earth**—\nroot and beginning are one.\n\n*\"Continuous\"*—\nwhen the prior resonance fades,\nthe next sound strikes,\nits response remains unchanged.\nThus it is said to *\"as-if-preserve\"*—\nthe **Valley-Spirit** does not perish.\nIf used, the more it is applied,\nit seems labored yet truly requires no effort—\nmove with its emptiness,\nwith its void.\nThe void generates the real,\nthe nonexistent generates the existent—\nwhat else could it be but **Spirit**?\n\nThe cultivation of *qi* is but another extension by humans of their own reasoning.\n\nWu Huanzhong said: *\"The Valley-Spirit does not die—its use requires no effort.\"*\n\nWu Huanzhong’s disciple, Wu Zhen, remarked: *\"The *Laozi* contains hidden Daoist intent—when the spirit is ever-nourished, the *po* does not dissipate, and water and fire harmonize. His words are most unusual.\"*\n\nI once heard my teacher say: *\"The Valley-Spirit is the primordial *qi* of Heaven-before-Heaven. Spirit-*qi* returns to the Mysterious Feminine, and wherever the mind moves, it borrows spirit to act—not through mouth or nose. Mysterious, it is Yang; Feminine, it is Yin—true Yin, true Yang.\"*\n\nAs *Zhuangzi* says: *\"All things are born, yet none know their root; they emerge, yet none know their gate. But the source from which Heaven and Earth arise is the Mysterious Feminine.\"*\n\nThe essence of the Great Elixir lies not beyond the spirit, soul, *po*, and intent. Spirit is fire; essence is water—true unity’s essence. The soul is wood; the *po* is metal; intent is earth. The Five Phases cannot be pure without earth, and intent nourishes *qi*. Nourishing *qi* condenses essence; condensing essence awakens spirit. When the Four Symbols harmonize into one, refined practice makes *qi* soft and enduring—unbroken, like thread. Its use requires no effort; day and night, it flows naturally.\n\nAncient immortals, whether hidden or revealed, spoke of *yin-yang* as substance, likened it to lead and mercury, compared it to sun and moon, modeled it on male and female, likened it to dragon and tiger—*Zhen* and *Dui*, *Kan* and *Li*, gold and cinnabar, *Jia* and *Geng*, *Bing* and *Ren*, *Wu* and *Ji*, water and fire, sovereign and minister, child and mother, infant and maiden, knife and scale, metal and wood, warmth and cold, host and guest, floating and sinking, bathing and rinsing, birth and death, punishment and virtue, battle and retreat, waxing and waning, addition and subtraction, *wen* and *wu*, hot and cold—all these are matters of the Mysterious Feminine. Thus, they established symbols in metaphor, urging one to self-realization: seek it within, not without. Have you not heard the saying: *\"The Master of Emptiness and Stillness governs spirit, spirit retains *qi*—no need for external arts to attain longevity?\"*\n\nToday’s seekers of the Dao may recognize medicinal herbs but lack the means to apply them. Even if they know where to begin, they fail to grasp the method, wandering lost in the Mysterious Feminine’s domain. Spirit is the root of life; form is the vessel of spirit. When spirit is whole, *qi* is whole; when *qi* is whole, essence is whole; when essence is whole, form is whole; when form is whole, spirit thrives; when spirit thrives, *qi* is refined; when *qi* is refined, spirit transcends. At first, it aligns with the Dao as one. But when spirit is diminished, essence cannot recover; when essence is depleted, the *po* is restless.\n\nYou study texts—do you not understand the interplay of things? Yet in waking and sleeping, in seeing, hearing, speaking, and moving, your mind wanders beyond the reach of ears, eyes, heart, and thought. This is what ancient immortals, having cast aside desires and transcended the mundane, achieved only through unyielding resolve. If spirit cannot govern *qi*, and *qi* cannot solidify form, how can one dwell in peace, much less preserve their dwelling? To seek enduring attainment is difficult indeed.\n\nYou heard my words, and with a smile of sudden understanding, said nothing.\n\nThe teacher then poured wine and sang a chapter from *The Songs of Chu*:\n\n*\"The Dao can be received but not transmitted,\nIts smallness has no bounds within,\nIts greatness knows no limits without.\nWithout deceit, the spirit is pure—\nThen it follows its natural course.\nHow could it be that *qi* is so refined,\nThat at midnight, in emptiness, it waits—\nBefore action, in non-doing’s embrace?\"*\n\nWith a bow, he departed. On a leisurely day, I composed three stanzas to caution myself:\n\n*\"Not all demons are heavy burdens,\nComing forward to speak of foolish dreams.\nXie the Immortal lights the fire with shared intent,\nYangzi’s riverbank watches one *liang* of gold.\nWhen alone, the work is just right—\nConcealed, concealed, concealed, yet not difficult.\nThere are hundreds of green-copper vessels,\nOften poured with kind words to quench my thirst.\nRain or no rain, wind or no wind,\nWithout doubt, without worry, laughter rings warm.\nClustered joy on cinnabar’s earth,\nSealed alone, opened alone.\"*\n\nAnd another poem:\n\n*\"Do not delay in beginning—\nWhat doubt remains of the Golden Elixir?\nA single ball of harmonized *qi*—\nMind the fire’s precision.\nWhen the Four Symbols unite,\nDivine insight naturally appears.\nTo grasp its true mystery,\nObserve the lone moon over the pool.\"*\n\n*—Moon House carving on Stone Pool’s annotation of the* Dao De Jing*, appended by Zhen to this chapter on the Valley-Spirit. Master Wu Zhen’s poem reads:*\n\n*\"Do not blame Heaven’s secrets for leaking—\nIt is because seekers are too bewildered.\nHahaha.\"*\n\nMaster Benyuan said: *\"The Valley-Spirit does not die—its use requires no effort. The Valley is empty yet formed; the spirit within it is formless yet present. Mysterious, it is deep yet intangible; as the Feminine, it is void yet substantial. Formless yet present—thus it does not die; void yet substantial—thus it can generate. This too is the body of the Dao.*\n\n*Its emergence is called the Gate; its sustaining root is called the Root. The first chapter speaks of Heaven, Earth, and all things. But here, it does not mention all things—for where there are Heaven and Earth, there are all things. The Root is that which endlessly generates, and thus all things are within it. If one embodies the Dao in the body, unbroken as thread, then the Valley-Spirit and the Mysterious Feminine will reside within you, and the Dao’s use will know no end.*\n\n*Unbroken—neither void nor not-void.\nAs-if-preserved—neither present nor not-present.\nWithout effort—without toil.\nIf one says it is taken from left or right,\nIt is but returning to its origin.\nThe *Laozi*’s intent is, broadly, to trace the Dao’s mystery back to Heaven—Heaven and Earth’s beginning—and then reflect it within the self, embodying and preserving it. Mencius’ *xiao-hua cun-shen* is akin to the Valley-Spirit. The Buddhist *zhēnkōng miǎoyǒu* aligns with the Mysterious Feminine.\"*\n\n「绵绵若存，则释氏之无作止任灭，孟子之勿正勿忘勿助长，而必有事焉者也。 *《拾遗》*秉文曰：此章言道无为无形，生天生地，自古以固存。 河上公曰玄牝为口鼻，养生者尚之。 何其小哉。\n\n*《诸子旁证》*：*《列子》*其言曰：有生不生，有化不化，不生者能生生，不化者能化化。 生者不能不生，化者不能不化，故常生常化。 常生常化者，无时不生，无时不化，阴阳尔，四时尔。 不生者疑独，不化者往复。 往复，其际不可终。 疑独，其道不可穷。\n\n*《黄帝书》*曰：谷神不死，是谓玄牝。 玄牝之门，是谓天地之根。 绵绵若存，用之不动。 故生物者不生，化物者不化。 自生自化，自形自色，自智自力，自消自息，谓之生化、形色、智力、消息者，非也。\n\n石潭曰：谷神不死，是谓玄牝。 此段有两说。\n有以谷神为谷虚之生响若有神者，此以理言也。\n有以谷神为天谷之神，谓吾身之神居於天谷中者，此以气言也。\n虽若两说，其实一也。 何则？\n虚中之神，此道也。 天谷中之神，亦此道也。\n虚谷之神与吾身之神同出於道，安有异哉？\n\n玄牝二字，有以牝为物之所生而不见其所以生之者，故以玄言。\n盖因*《列子》*之引*《黄帝书》*谓此为天地之能生生者言之也。\n有以玄牝为吾身之玄牝者，即修养家所指者。\n是知以理言之，则空谷之有响，斯答寂然不动，感而遂通，而声之出者常在是。\n盖能生而不见其所以生也，故曰谷神不死，是谓玄牝。\n若以吾身之神居天谷者言之，则天谷之神所以不死者，以玄牝有以生之也。\n\n玄牝之门，是谓天地根。\n玄牝之门，是谓天地根。\n二说不同。\n以理言之，则程泰之之说是也。\n若以吾身之玄牝言之，则有以人之二肾为玄牝者，有以二肾之间为玄牝者，有以口鼻为玄牝者，有以鼻二窍为玄牝者。\n要之，二肾之间之说近之。\n口鼻乃玄牝出入之门，通乎天地之气者也。\n\n绵绵若存，用之不勤。\n以理言之，则绵绵若存者，天地之气生生不已，未尝间断，绵绵不绝，以其不绝，故曰绵绵若存，用之不勤。\n以不见其逃，故曰若存。\n用之不勤者，用之不劳也。\n若以人身之玄牝言之，则玄牝之门，天地之气，往来乎鼻息之间，使之绵绵不绝，存若不存，息微气定则上通天谷，通玄牝，而谷神常不死矣。\n用之不勤者，常宽舒而不当急迫勤劳也。\n\n*《道德真经集义》卷之十一竟\n*《道德真经集义》卷之十二」\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久章)**\n\n*Considerations of Differences (考异):*\nThe River Upper Master (河上公) composed *The Chapter of Concealing Brilliance (韬光章)*, while Zhao Shizhan (赵实庵) titled it *The Chapter on Eternal Generation Without Generation (生生不生义章)*.\n\nEmperor Ming of Tang (唐明皇) commented:\nIn the previous chapter, the **Daoist Mystery of the Eternal Valley Spirit (谷神不死)** was illuminated through its hollow response—this hollow response is the very **unexhausted source**. This chapter elucidates the **impartiality of Heaven and Earth**, for their impartiality is why they endure eternally. It begins by setting forth Heaven and Earth as an analogy, then proceeds to cite the Sage (圣人) to further clarify, concluding with the principle that impartiality fulfills private ends, urging diligence in this practice.\n\nDu Guangting (杜光庭) remarked:\nThe previous chapter expounded upon the **Daoist Mystery of the Eternal Valley Spirit**, illustrating how Heaven and Earth **nurture qi** through natural spontaneity. This chapter emphasizes **Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久)**, aligning with the **practice of natural spontaneity**. The Sage, too, by **applying the Way with impartiality**, ensures that all things converge—thus attaining **harmony and national tranquility**. Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **do not selfishly assert their own generation**; the Sage **abandons his own self** while his self persists, and **sets aside his own self** while his self remains. Is this not because of their **impartiality**? Thus, they fulfill their **private ends**.\n\n*Considerations of Differences (考异):*\nThe River Upper Master (河上公) and Yan Junping (严君平) originally read, *\"Is this not because of their **impartiality**?\"* (非以其无私邪), but Wang Bi’s (王弼) ancient version read, *\"Is this not because of their **lack of impartiality**?\"* (不以其无私邪). The Kaiyuan Imperial Edition (开元御本) restored it to *\"Is this not because of their **impartiality**?\"* (非以其无私邪).\n\nThe River Upper Master (河上公) said:\n**Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久)**—this expounds upon the **longevity of Heaven and Earth**, serving as a metaphor for instruction. Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **do not selfishly assert their own generation**. Their singular capacity to endure long is because they **remain tranquil**, act without expectation of reward, and do not **reside like mortals**, nor **covet private benefits** by seizing others’ blessings. Thus, they attain **eternal longevity**. Since they **do not seek their own generation**, they can **endure without ceasing**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **abandons his own self**—this is the practice of **prioritizing others before oneself**. Yet his self **persists first**—for the world reveres him foremost, deeming him eternal. He **sets aside his own self**—this is the practice of **neglecting oneself for others**. Yet his self **remains preserved**—for the people love him as a parent, and the spirits nurture him like an infant, so his self **endures perpetually**. Is this not because of their **impartiality**? Thus, they fulfill their **private ends**. What others consider **private** is the **desire to enrich oneself**. The Sage, being impartial, yet **enriches himself**, thus fulfilling his **private ends**.\n\nWang Fu’s (王辅嗣) commentary:\n**Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久) because they do not selfishly assert their own generation**—to selfishly assert one’s own generation is to **contend with all things**; not to do so is for all things to **converge naturally**. Thus, they endure eternally and fulfill their **private ends**. **Impartiality** is to **act without selfish regard for oneself**; when one’s self **persists first** and **remains preserved**, it is said that one fulfills their **private ends**.\n\nEmperor Ming of Tang (唐明皇) said:\n**Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久)**—by setting forth Heaven and Earth’s eternal endurance, it is made clear that **impartiality and lack of desire** lead to **eternal longevity**. The conclusion of the metaphor and its meaning lie in the Sage’s **abandoning and setting aside his own self**, wherein **impartiality fulfills private ends**.\n\nCommentary (疏):\nThis chapter begins with a **posed question**. Heaven is called **long** because of its **vital qi (气象)**, and Earth is called **durable** because of its **substance and form (形质)**. Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **do not selfishly assert their own generation**. Their **virtue and power** in nurturing all things are vast, yet they endure long because they **draw from the Dao’s foundation**, not **boasting of their own generative function**.\n\nCommentary (疏):\nThe opening sentence poses a question; the following is a hypothetical response: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **cover and nourish all things**, fostering the myriad materials, all of which **draw from the Dao’s foundation**. They do not **boast of their own generative function**, thus their longevity enables them to **generate all things**.\"* Another interpretation states: *\"Not selfishly asserting their own generation\"* means that Heaven and Earth **only generate and nourish all things**, without **privately enriching their own existence**. Thus, they attain **eternal longevity**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **endures while his self persists**—**abandoning his own self** leads others to **delight in promoting him**, so his self **persists first**. **Setting aside his own self** results in **tranquil forgetfulness**, so his self **remains preserved**. Commentary (疏):\nThus, the Sage **imitates Heaven and Earth**, ensuring **equitable coverage** and **nurturing without selfishness**, so he **prioritizes others first**. The people **rejoice and rely upon him**; he is revered by those below, so his self **persists first**. He **does not boast or blame himself**; when the world **converges upon his virtue (仁)**, he faces **no fear or harm**, so his self **remains preserved**.\n\nIs this not because of their **impartiality**? Thus, they fulfill their **private ends**. Heaven and Earth **forget their generative function**, being impartial yet enduring eternally—this is fulfilling their **private ends**. The Sage **abandons and sets aside his own self**, embodying **impartiality**, yet **persists first and remains preserved**—this is fulfilling his **private ends**.\n\nCommentary (疏):\nHeaven and Earth endure eternally, and the Sage’s self **persists first and remains preserved**, not because of their **lack of self-interest**, but because of their **impartiality**, thus fulfilling this **eternal longevity** and **prioritized preservation**.\n\nDu Guangting (杜光庭) remarked:\n**Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久)**—The **Venerable Master Laozi** seeks to elucidate Heaven and Earth’s eternal endurance to instruct the rulers of the world, thus beginning the chapter with his own question. *\"Heaven, by its **accumulation of qi (气)**, is called **long**\"*—as *Liezi* states: *\"Heaven accumulates qi; without qi, there is no qi.\"* *\"Earth, by its **accumulation of matter (块)**, is called **durable**\"*—as *Liezi* states: *\"Earth accumulates matter; without substance, there is no matter.\"* **Qi accumulates to form the ethereal (象)**, and **matter accumulates to form the solid (形)**. The *Appendix to the Yijing (易□系辞)* states: *\"In Heaven, it manifests as **symbols (象)**; on Earth, it manifests as **forms (形)**.\"* When **symbols transform above and forms solidify below**, **change and response** are evident, and **prolific generation** ensues.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure eternally because they **do not selfishly assert their own generation**. The **Venerable Master Laozi**, intending to clarify this **eternal principle**, poses the question himself—just as literary scholars invoke **the absent Prince Gong (亡是公子)**, **Mr. Wu You (乌有先生)**, or **the owner of the Eastern Capital (东都主人)** as stylistic conventions.\n\n「Thus, the question is posed and answered by oneself to reveal its meaning. Having already asked in the previous verse—*\"Why does Heaven endure and Earth last so long?\"*—this one responds: *\"Because Heaven and Earth utilize the **Dao/Way's** primordial harmony (运元和) and the **cosmic surge** (冲用) of **qi**, nurturing all existences (群品). Though all existences thrive, Heaven and Earth do not claim their **virtue/power** (德) nor possess their **achievement** (功), and thus they endure eternally.*\n\n*If they claimed their achievement, their **virtue/power** would dwindle; if they possessed their **virtue/power**, it would grow shallow. By not claiming, their **virtue/power** is vast and their **achievement** grand—all things return to their source, and thus Heaven and Earth endure.*\n\n*The sovereign who governs his realm should follow the Dao/Way of Heaven, acting without contrivance (无为), letting all flourish in ease (熙熙). When the people naturally attain peace (平泰), then the nation’s blessings will stretch far, and his own lifespan will extend long—just as Heaven and Earth endure through their lack of selfishness.*\n\n*The sage who cultivates himself avoids laborious schemes and vain pursuits of name, nor does he exhaust his **qi** with ambitious deeds or indulgent desires. His spirit remains tranquil within, his **qi** harmonious within, and thus his nation’s fortune endures, his body thrives—just as Heaven and Earth, without selfishness, endure eternally.*\n\n*Therefore, the sage arrives while his body still lives. In governing the realm, he does not arrogantly seek noble status through action nor burden the people for his own gain—this is what is called **posterity’s body** (后身) and **external body** (外身).*\n\n*The sovereigns of the **Age of Great Clarity** (太古) encompassed the will of Heaven and Earth, their benevolence extending to all under Heaven, yet they were unknown by name. In life, they held no rank, no station; in death, no posthumous title, no record of their deeds. Their substance did not gather, their fame did not stand—yet all under Heaven willingly honored them, and all things joyfully revered them. Truly, they embodied **posterity’s body while their own body led** (后身而身先), **external body while their own body endured** (外身而身存)!*\n\n*But in the world’s decline, such sovereigns no longer exist. Instead, they indulge their own desires, enslaving the people, and drain their strength to serve themselves. The people grow weary, governance falters, and all under Heaven abandons them. This is what is called **losing the way of external and posterity’s body** (失外身后身之道).*\n\n*How much better to discard the **broken jade pillow** (碎琥珀之枕), abandon the **fine furs of the wild goose** (焚雉头之裘), cease the extravagance of a **single grand hall** (罢一台之费), and reject the **thousand-mile horses** (却千里之马)—thus, his **virtue/power** shines through the age, his name gleams on bamboo and silk. The scholar who refines himself does not covet honor or rank—this is **externalizing his body**; he does not rush for advancement—this is **postponing his body**. Thus, his body endures while his **virtue/power** is full; when his **virtue/power** is full, all submit. This is truly **body leading while body endures** (身先身存).*\n\n*To invert this is to stray far from the Dao/Way. Is it not because they lack selfishness that they achieve such greatness?*\n\n*The sage’s cultivation of himself is thus: he aligns with Nature’s transformations, neither monopolizing singular insights nor hoarding his life’s blessings. He does not arrogate his own virtue, nor does he claim precedence over all under Heaven—yet he stands above all, enjoys long fortune, and all people find solace in their hearts, while the uncivilized bow in reverence. Weapons fall silent, ancestral temples stand secure. This is the greatness of his lack of selfishness!*\n\n*For it is because he does not cling to selfishness as selfishness that he attains such brilliance. In cultivating himself, his **virtue/power** is full and all submit; his **Dao/Way** resonates with the divine, his body thrives eternally—this is the greatness of his lack of selfishness! It is also because he does not yield to selfish cravings that he achieves this vast lack of selfishness.*\n\n*The **Scripture of the Spirit Jewel** (灵宝经) says: *\"Those who dwell in the world, chasing pleasures and indulging desires, find joy now and suffering later. Why so? Because they reach the extreme of ease and fall into the three abysses (三涂).\"* The scholar of the Dao/Way cuts ties with worldly gains, forgets fame, endures cold lodgings, and refines his conduct—ultimately attaining the **Dao/Way of transcendence** (仙道). First suffering, then joy—why? Because he accumulates his deeds and ascends to the **Nine Heavens** (九天).*\n\n*The **Venerable Sovereign of the Dao/Way** (宋道君) said: *\"Heaven endures and Earth lasts long because they do so eternally. Heaven’s vault is vast and its station above, with the **celestial axis** (经) as the sun and moon, and the **celestial loom** (纬) as the stars and constellations, sheltering all things beneath. Earth’s foundation is firm and its station below, forming mountains and valleys, blending into rivers and marshes, bearing all things upon it. All things are sheltered and carried by Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth have no concern for them—thus, Heaven moves ceaselessly yet remains steadfast, Earth stands firm yet endures without change, and so they last long and endure.*\n\n*If Heaven and Earth had concern for all things, then Heaven would soon be measured, its sheltering shallow; Earth would soon be fathomed, its bearing thin. If so, they would rely on others—how could they then endure eternally?\"*\n\n*Therefore, the sage arrives while his body still lives. Heaven moves above, Earth rests below; the sage stands between them, embodying the **Three Powers** (三才) in harmony, distinguishing the **Three Poles** (三极) in their essence, and uniting the **Three Spirits** (三灵) in their **primordial marvel** (元妙之神). Yet Heaven, Earth, and the sage all attain the Dao/Way. And the sage’s method of governing himself is also that of Heaven and Earth. Hence, this chapter first speaks of Heaven and Earth not asserting their own generation, and then follows with the sage not possessing his own body.*\n\n*All take precedence for themselves, yet the sage alone takes what comes later—saying, *\"I bear all under Heaven’s filth\"* (受天下之垢), which is called **postponing his body**, meaning he does not contend with others, and thus none can contend with him. Hence it is said: *\"Postponing his body, yet his body leads.\"* He does not vie for perilous advantages nor struggle for ease in winter and summer, nor does he compete for the balance of **yin and yang**. He transcends life and death, abandons fortune and misfortune, and his spirit is never constrained.*\n\n*This is called **externalizing his body while his body endures**. If the sage’s method of governing himself is thus, how much more so for external matters? He encounters them without clinging, passes them without retaining, his nature embracing the spirit, wandering between ancient customs and the present. The people will self-correct, distinctions between self and other dissolve, and he is born before Heaven and Earth yet does not age, enduring beyond the **Age of Great Clarity** (上古) without growing old. This is his effect! Is it not because he lacks selfishness?\"*\n\nThe sage thus achieves his own ends.\n\nThe great **virtue/power** (德) of Heaven and Earth is called **generation** (生), and the great treasure of the sage is called **position** (位). The **Dao/Way** (道) is the public principle by which these are realized. Heaven and Earth embody the **Dao/Way**, hence they lack selfishness; lacking selfishness, they endure long. The sage embodies the **Dao/Way**, hence he lacks selfishness; lacking selfishness, he remains everlasting. To **self-cultivate for private gain** (自营) is selfishness, and none have ever succeeded in their selfishness. Wang Anshi said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate** (长生). \"Long\" refers to their vastness, \"durable\" to their constancy. Since they do not **self-generate**, they can **long-generate**.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure because they do not **self-generate** but allow all things to generate as they will. Having allowed all things to generate, they can then **long-generate** all things without bearing the burden of **generation** (生). Again, he said: When speaking of Heaven, one says \"long\"; when speaking of Earth, one says \"durable,\" so it is clear that \"durable\" is the heavier term. Therefore, the sage arrives yet his body precedes. The sage has no **self** (我), for if he had a self, he would contend with things, and things would draw him into contention. All things oppose the **self** (我). If I do not oppose them, I follow them. **Externalizing his body while his body endures** (外其身而身存). All things burden the **self** (我), but if I do not burden myself with them, I externalize them. Therefore, it is said: **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends?\n\nThe *Zi Shuo* (《字说》) says: \"Self-cultivation for private gain\" (自营) is selfishness, and turning one's back on the public is selfishness. Those who **self-cultivate for private gain** (自营) have never succeeded in their selfishness. Therefore, the character for \"selfishness\" (私) is composed of \"self-cultivation\" (自营) and does not include the shape of \"harm.\" Hence, Laozi said: It is not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends. The character \"private\" (私) is formed from \"禾\" (*hé*, grain) and \"ㄙ\" (*sī*, self-cultivation). Self-cultivation cannot avoid being selfish, but if selfishness does not harm the utility of things, then there is no grievance toward selfishness.\n\nSu Yingbin said: Heaven and Earth endure. Though vast, their endurance is not separate from form and number, so their long-lasting nature is limited. Yet Laozi’s words on endurance extend to Heaven and Earth. This is merely from the perspective of what humans perceive. As for the ultimate endurance, it is what is called the **beginning of Heaven and Earth** (天地始). Heaven and Earth thus achieve their own ends through **long-endurance**. Heaven and Earth generate all things yet do not **self-generate**; they stand outside all things, hence they can **long-generate**. The sage follows his own body yet precedes others; **externalizes his body while his body endures**, benefiting others. He stands apart from the crowd, hence he can both precede and endure.\n\nIf Heaven and Earth were to contend with things for **generation**, and if the sage were to compete with others for **virtue/power**, then Heaven and Earth would merely be one thing among many, and the sage merely one person among others. How could this be considered a great transgression? Though they lack selfishness, it is not to seek their own ends that they succeed in achieving them—this is simply the **Dao/Way** as it is. Lü Jiufu said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**. \"Long\" and \"short\" refer to form, \"durable\" and \"near\" to time. Heaven acts according to time, yet since time is insufficient to describe its form, one speaks of it as \"long.\" Earth acts according to form, yet since form is insufficient to describe its duration, one speaks of it as \"durable.\"\n\nThe root of Heaven and Earth lies in the **Dark Mother** (玄牝), and the essence of the **Dark Mother** is established in the **Valley Spirit** (谷神), which is **not-death** (不死). **Not-death** means **not-generation**, and those who do not generate can generate **generation**. This is why Heaven and Earth can endure both long and durable—because they do not **self-generate**, and not **self-generating**, they can **long-generate**. It is as if they were the **Valley Spirit** itself. Therefore, the sage arrives yet his body precedes. The sage does not consider his body as a burden, though it is unavoidable, and nothing can surpass it. **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. He stands in the **non-existence of existence** (无何有), and no thing can harm him, hence it is said: **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends?\n\nThe body is my own selfishness. To **follow his own body** (后其身) and **externalize his body** (外其身) is to act publicly and without selfishness. Without selfishness, he can achieve his own ends. Lü Nongshi said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**. Those who cling to life do not generate, and those who abandon life do not die. Hence it is said: Heaven and Earth endure. Heaven and Earth endure because they do not **self-generate**, hence they can **long-generate**. Therefore, the sage arrives yet his body endures. The sage is the **harmonious union of Heaven and Earth** (天地之合), and his only task is to **bend himself** (屈己). By this, he first forgets the **self** (我), and thus the **self** (我) is preserved. Hence it is said: The sage arrives yet his body endures. Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends?\n\nIt is not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends. Yet bending himself is easy to forget. Wang Yuanzhe said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**. If one **self-generates**, then one has one’s own **generation**, and having one’s own **generation** means that **generation** is already lost. Only he who does not take **generation** as his standard has never **generated**. **Generation** never **generated**, so though his form may **generate**, it does not bear the burden of **generation**, and thus it is fitting that he endure both long and durable. Heaven and Earth’s not **self-generating** is not for the sake of enduring long and durable—this is simply the **Dao/Way** as it is. What is called \"long-durable\" is also but a fleeting moment. Only what **covers and sustains** (盖载) without ever failing is its true nature.\n\nTherefore, the sage **follows his own body** yet his body precedes. Though the sage is sage, his form is equal to that of things; only by embodying the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and not contending does he alone differ from the crowd. If he were to establish himself and oppose the crowd, even an ordinary person would be sufficient to overcome him. **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. If he has a **self** (我) and preserves it, then all things become his enemies. Only he who transcends and **self-destroys** (自丧), who does not possess a **self**, can none of the things overturn him. It is not because he lacks selfishness that he achieves his own ends. The sage lacks selfishness because he has never possessed a **self**. If he were to scheme and act thus, then how much more selfish would he be?\n\nLiu Jujie said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**.\n\n「Heaven and Earth endure through their **harmonizing** (燮) and **unity** (和). When things **generate one another** (物物我生), they must inevitably **decay** (衰) and **be consumed** (敝). Only when one does not **self-generate** (不我其生) to fulfill the **principle** (理) of creation does **long-generation** (长生) become possible.\n\nHeaven **accumulates qi** (气), and its fortune lies in **dispersion** (远), hence its association with **length** (长). Earth **accumulates mass** (块), and its fortune lies in **solidity** (固), hence its association with **duration** (久). They do not say **\"long-generation\"** (久生) because of their **length and duration** (长久).\n\nThough Heaven and Earth **accumulate qi** and **mass**, their **principle** (理) remains unbroken while their **substance** (有) endures—how can one know that Heaven and Earth will ever **be consumed** (坏)? Thus, those who claim **length and duration** (长久) are **deluded** (妄者), for they only **observe substance** (有).\n\nHence, the sage **embodies** (至) the Dao while his body **endures**. When the sage **aligns with** Heaven and Earth, he **sacrifices his body** (后身), and his body, like theirs, does not **self-generate** (自生). For his body to **generate** (生) and **endure** (存) is akin to **long-generation** (长生). **\"Sacrificing his body\"** (后身) means **yielding to others** (屈己), and **\"externalizing his body\"** (外身) means **abandoning the self** (忘我). To **yield to others** (屈己) is to be **subdued by others** (人下之), hence he **takes precedence** (先). To **abandon the self** (忘我) is to **externalize his body** (外其身) while it **endures** (存).\n\nIs it not because he **lacks selfishness** (无私) that he achieves his own ends? **Long-generation** (长生) is not **self-generation** (自生), and **endurance** (存) is not **possession** (有). The sage **sacrifices his body** (后其身) yet does not **take precedence** (先), **externalizes his body** (外其身) yet does not **possess** (有). He **wanders beyond** the dust and filth, **unbound in the realm of non-action** (无为之业), **discarding his frame** (隳支体), **abandoning keen senses** (黜聪明), **separating from form and intelligence** (离形去智), **uniting with the Great Thoroughfare** (大通), and **aligning with the Dao in duration** (与道同久). Thus, his body does not **await precedence** (期先) yet **precedes**, does not **await endurance** (期存) yet **endures**.\n\nIs it not because he **lacks selfishness** (无私) that he achieves his own ends? The sage’s **sacrificing his body** (后其身) and **externalizing his body** (外其身) are **expressed outwardly** (为表) in **gentleness, weakness, and humility** (濡弱谦下), yet **substantiated inwardly** (为实) in **emptiness and non-destruction** (虚空不毁) of all things. Thus, the next section speaks of **\"the highest goodness is like water\"** (上善若水).\n\nZhao Shizhang said: The opening presents three causes:\n1. **Illustrating the principle of Heaven and Earth’s long-generation**. Heaven is **long**, Earth is **durable**. The Dao **manifests through symbols** (因象显) yet its end is unknown; fire **transmits through fuel** (以薪传) yet its exhaustion is unseen. When things **generate with form** (有象), the Dao **accompanies them**. That which **generates and continually generates** (生而生生) has never truly **generated**; fire **transmits yet becomes illumination** (传而为明), fuel **transforms while fire remains hidden** (薪化而火隐), and the **radiant** (昭昭) has never been **obscured** (昧). Thus, the previous section demonstrates **the Spirit of the Valley does not die** (谷神不死), which is called the **Mysterious Female** (玄牝). The **Gate of the Mysterious Female** (玄牝之门) is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth** (天地根). The **principle of its non-dying governance** (政不死之理) lies in **non-exertion** (不勤).\n\nContinuing with **Heaven and Earth’s long duration**, it takes their **manifestation** (征) as evidence.\n\n2. **Clarifying that self-generation originates from the absence of a fixed heart**. Heaven and Earth’s ability to be **long and durable** (能长且久) comes from the **original qi** (一炁) being **divided into the two polarities** (两仪), and though their **positions** (奠位) differ in **high and low**, they **share the essence of obtaining the One** (同乎得一之灵). Heaven, by **obtaining the One** (得一), is **naturally long** (固自长). Earth, by **obtaining the One** (得一), is **naturally durable** (固自久). **Long** (长) and **durable** (久) share the same **principle** (义) of **unity with the One** (同一体).\n\nWhy does Heaven speak of **long** (长), and Earth speak of **durable** (久)? Heaven is described through **qi** (气), hence **long**; Earth is described through **form** (形), hence **durable**. **Clear qi** (清气) ascends, and above it **form emerges** (上有形) while **uniting with the formless** (同乎无形). The **vast and boundless** (苍苍) is its **true color** (正色). **Turbulent qi** (浊气) descends, and below it **substance emerges** (下有气) yet cannot **escape form** (形). The **vastness** (广大) is its **self-sustaining nature** (自任).\n\nYet Heaven and Earth are **generated by the Dao** (道之所生). The **Great Dao** (大道) is **formless**, and it **nurtures** Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth regard the **formless** (无形) as their **parents** (父母). The **formless** (无形) is **nameless** (无名), and the **nameless** (无名) is the **beginning of Heaven and Earth** (天地之始). To **trace the origin of Heaven and Earth** (原天地之本) is to **receive emptiness in essence** (以虚受性), and to **transform essence into emptiness** (以性化虚)—this is **entering from substance into non-substance** (从有入无). To **transform emptiness into qi** (以虚化气), and to **generate form through qi** (以气生形), is **entering from non-substance into substance** (从无入有).\n\nThe **obtaining the One** (得一) refers to the **True Primordial Essence** (真元). The **True Primordial Essence** (真元) is the **Original Qi** (一气). Because the **two qi** (二气) **intermingle harmoniously** (交合) and do not **deviate from constancy** (失於常), they can **generate without end** (生生而不穷). If one were to regard their **intermingling and transformation** (交合变化) as **neither movement nor stillness** (无动无静), then Heaven would have **times of rupture** (有时而裂), and Earth would have **times of eruption** (有时而发). When the **One opens and closes** (一阖一辟), when it **moves and stirs** (一动一静), it **cycles the sun and moon** (运日月) to **divide day and night** (分昼夜), it **varies warmth and coolness** (变温凉) to **determine cold and heat** (定寒暑). All this is **continuous and enduring** (绵绵若存).\n\nHence, Liezi said: **\"The Original Qi does not advance suddenly** (一气不顿进), **and form does not diminish suddenly** (一形不顿亏)—this is its **moderation** (有节).\" Is it not because of **reaching the utmost emptiness and nurturing the spirit** (虚极而运神), **deep stillness and focused qi** (静笃而专气), that one can **flow with the Dao** (与道同流)?\n\nHeaven **cycles qi** (以气运), hence its **vaulted expanse** (穹窿) above. Earth **dwells in form** (以形处), hence its **solid bulk** (磅礡) below. This is the **natural position** (自然之位) of Heaven and Earth. **Qian** (乾) embodies **stillness and concentration** (静也专), while **Kun** (坤) embodies **movement and expansion** (动也辟). This is the **natural virtue/power** (自然之德) of Heaven and Earth. To **regard all things as grass and dogs** (刍狗), this is the **natural equity** (自然之公) of Heaven and Earth. To **respond to things with adaptability** (应物), this is the **natural principle** (自然之理) of Heaven and Earth, like the **key of a bellows** (橐钥).」\n\nYet when Heaven is spoken of in terms of its **cycling**, its motion resides in the center, while the **Six Qi** serve as its functions—movement never lacks stillness within it. When Earth is spoken of in terms of its **dwelling**, it stands firm and unyielding, yet **embracing vastness** as its virtue—stillness never lacks motion within it.\n\nYet what Heaven and Earth truly **concentrate upon** is **qi**, never upon things. When **qi** is concentrated, things naturally follow—what need is there for the mind?\n\nThe **Dao** follows **nature**; Heaven and Earth do likewise. Thus, **life emerges on its own**, and **transformation unfolds on its own**. All things flourish in their own way—**I nurture them yet do not claim them**; all affairs unfold in their own way—**I act yet do not rely upon them**. This is how one abides by the **Dao of enduring life and transformation**.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure long because they do not **self-generate**—thus they attain long life.\"* The term **\"able\"** refers to humans in contrast to Heaven and Earth.\n\nHow do we know this to be so? Heaven and Earth act without acting, yet nothing remains undone; they possess neither ability nor inability, neither having ability nor lacking it—this refers to humans. To say Heaven and Earth are **\"able\"** is to say they do not cling to their own life, hence they attain long life. To say humans are **\"unable\"** is to say they cling to things as their own, hence they lose life. Thus Heaven and Earth endure long—why then speak of **\"yet\"**?\n\nAmong forms, none is greater than Heaven and Earth; among lifespans, none surpasses **Qian** and **Kun**. **\"Yet\"** means **\"yet\"** and nothing more. Yet even Heaven and Earth, though vast, when viewed through the **Dao**, do not depart from form. What has form cannot endure forever; what is fated cannot last eternally. At the great cycle’s turn, all must return to decay—yet what has not yet decayed is merely said to **\"yet\"** endure.\n\nWhat does not decay is the **nature of Heaven and Earth**; what decays is their **fated measure**. To observe **the worries of the State of Qi**, the answer does not reach this depth.\n\n**Thus, there is no ultimate end.**\n\nBecause they do not **self-generate**, they attain long life.\n*The Daoist Scripture* says: **\"Form stands by the Dao; spirit arises from emptiness.\"**\nIndeed, humans share with Heaven and Earth the same **original qi**, yet cannot endure as they do because they fail to guard it by the **Dao**.\n\nHeaven and Earth naturally **refine the elixir**, with **lead-dragon and mercury-tiger**, **coiled and hidden at co\n\n「Speaking of the Sage’s desire to attain the **Dao/Way of Sageship**, he does not place his own body before others—this is **selfishness**. Yet in his movements and interactions, he never fails to observe the rites of **humility and deference**; others, in turn, regard him as placing theirs first.\n\nThis is **acting last yet taking precedence**—could it not be **selfishness**? As for **placing the body externally yet preserving it**, if one does not place the body externally, it will be set in a realm of **desired things**; if **desire overcomes**, harm arises, and harm to the body **injures life**.\n\nNow, those who place their bodies externally do so to **desire their own bodies** yet not to be **ensnared by external things**—only then can they preserve their bodies. To preserve one’s body is to **regard the body as private**.\n\nWhen the body suffers no harm and thus attains **long preservation**, this is **public virtue**. The Sage’s actions should not be said to be **selfish**, yet when he acts with **selfishness**, it is because at their origin he did not dare speak of them openly—thus they are called **\"deviant\"**.\n\n**\"Deviant\"** means **doubtful and seemingly contradictory**. The **Scripture** points to the Sage’s **selfishness**, saying: *\"Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he attains public virtue?\"* Do not say the Sage lacks selfishness; it is **through selfishness that he achieves public virtue**.\n\nThus, the term **\"deviant\"** refers to **placing the body last and externally** to attain selfishness. **Xu You** did not accept the name **\"Non-Action\"**—this was placing his body last, and Xu You attained his selfishness. **Bao Shu** had the **principle of sharing wealth**—this was placing his body externally, and Bao Shu attained his public virtue.\n\nYet, the **Dao/Way of selfishness** in Heaven and Earth lies in their **not self-generating**—who then knows how the **Dao** makes this **public virtue**?\n\n**Shao Ruo Qu** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure long and last because they attain selfishness.\"* Heaven and Earth endure long and last, yet they do not know of **rainbow transformations** or **misty vapors**; winds and rains follow the four seasons, and **accumulated qi** forms Heaven. Mountains and rivers, seas and lakes, metals and stones, grasses and woods—**accumulated forms** constitute Earth.\n\nWhat has form, how could it not decay? Heaven and Earth endure long and last because the **cyclical movements of the seasons** follow the **Dao/Way** as the **master of life and transformation**; Heaven and Earth, not self-generating, thus attain **long life**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage imitates them, dwelling in **humility and deference** yet never **self-exalting**. Placing his body last, his body is yet **regarded by others as first**; considering all worldly benefits as **external to the body**, he does not let them **burden him**, and thus his body is preserved for long.\n\nThe Sage’s **placing his body last** and **externally**—is it not because he has **selfishness**? He imitates Heaven and Earth in their **action-yet-non-action**, thus attaining his selfishness.\n\n**Wang Zhi Ran** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure long and last because they attain selfishness.\"* The **Dao/Way** permeates the **Four Great Elements**—within the Four Great Elements, those who attain the **Dao** and thus become great, none greater than Heaven, Earth, and the Sage.\n\nHeaven attains **One** to become **clear and pure**, its **vaulted dome** positioned **above**, its **body** as **Qian**—**unyielding, vigorous, and upright**, all things **begin from it**, **steady yet eternally in motion**. **Zhuangzi** said: *\"The **Dao/Way of Heaven** moves yet **accumulates nothing**.\"* The *I Ching* says: *\"It **simplifies** for people.\"*\n\nEarth attains **One** to become **tranquil and enduring**, its **vast expanse** positioned **below**, its **constancy** as **Kun**—**receptive and enduring**, it **supports Heaven and nourishes all**, all things **find life from it**, **relaxed yet eternally at rest**. **Zhuangzi** said: *\"The **Dao/Way of Earth** moves yet **accumulates nothing**.\"* The *I Ching* says: *\"It **simplifies** for people.\"*\n\nIn speaking of Heaven and Earth, this is **complete**. **Qian** is the **symbol of Heaven**, **Kun** the **symbol of Earth**. When **Qian** is **still**, its **specialization** is complete; when it moves, it is **direct**—thus **great life** arises. When **Kun** is **still**, its **gathering** is **concentrated**; when it moves, it **expands**—thus **broad life** arises.\n\nTherefore, Heaven attains this to **endure in clarity**, Earth attains this to **endure in tranquility**. Heaven and Earth having attained the **most simple and easy Dao/Way**, thus **survive through vast calamities** and **endure eternally**, spanning **ten thousand ages** without decay.\n\nYet what **Laozi** called *\"Heaven and Earth enduring long\"* was because they **do not self-generate**, thus they attain **long life**. To compare the Sage to Heaven and Earth—though Heaven and Earth endure long and last, their **origin is rooted in the subtle and natural essence of True One**, sharing **the same body as the Dao**, thus they **cover and load all things**, **endure and nourish all things**, **complete and perfect all things**, **guide and transform the four seasons**, their **movements and measures are boundless**—in **life**, they **store and accumulate**; in **endurance**, they **lengthen and cultivate**; in **completion**, they **perfect and ripen**; in **nourishment**, they **cover and sustain**, never once **inviting the mind**, yet **effortlessly fulfilled**, never **claiming ownership of their actions**.\n\nEven when they give life, they do not know **how they give life**. The Sage embodies Heaven and Earth’s **creative transformations**, yet **resides in the middle**, **harmonizing the Three Powers**, **discerning the Three Poles**, **uniting the Three Spirits**, **gazing upon the world below without duality**, always **taking the hearts of the people as his own**, while the people **look up to the Sage without two Daos**, always **taking the Sage’s Dao/Way as their own**.\n\nThe world **governs itself without action**. The Sage, when **forced to govern** the **State of Qi**, never **placed his body before others** though his body was yet **regarded as first**; he **externally placed his body** yet never **prioritized external things**, and the people **joyfully followed him without wearying**. As in the *Book of Poetry*: *\"From the east and from the west, from the south and from the north, none do not submit without thought.\"*\n\nAh! The **greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth** is **generation**; the **greatest treasure of the Sage** is **position**. Heaven **covers without selfishness**; Earth **loads without selfishness**. Yet Heaven can **cover** but not **load**, Earth can **load** but not **cover**—this is also **Heaven and Earth’s incomplete virtue**.\n\nObserving this from a **human perspective**, Heaven and Earth endure long and last—**indeed, they cannot be imitated or reasoned with**. Observing this from the **Dao/Way**, Heaven and Earth’s endurance is thus, yet it is **but a fleeting moment**.\n\nThus, the Sage is **not a talent born in every age**; he **harbors the potential for great action**, **public yet without selfishness**, **humble to preserve himself**, **wandering in the world’s joys and sorrows**, **sharing breath with the people**, continuing with the Sage’s **not self-possessing his body**.\n\nIs this **indeed selfishness**? Or **indeed without selfishness**? **Zhuangzi** said: *\"Non-Action and no form are like without selfishness; emotions and trust are like with selfishness.\"* Thus it is said: *\"Is it not because he lacks selfishness?\"»\n\n「Thus, it is precisely because he can fulfill his own selfishness. What do the learned say of this?\n\nHuang Maocai said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure long because they can fulfill their own selfishness.\"* All things draw upon Heaven and Earth to be born, yet Heaven and Earth never truly give birth to them. Humans give birth to humans, beasts to beasts, birds to birds, fish to fish, grasses and trees to grasses and trees—what part do Heaven and Earth play in this? The **Dao/Way of eternal generation** does not itself generate; thus all things undergo **transformation and renewal** while it remains unending.\n\nThat which does not generate does not die; thus Heaven and Earth endure without ceasing. If a person can align with Heaven and Earth, why should he not attain **long life**?\n\nTherefore, the Sage **preserves his body while fulfilling his virtue/power**. To **postpone one’s body** is the means to **conduct oneself in the world**; to **transcend one’s body** is the means to **embody the Dao/Way**. Now, if a person **humble and modest**, **retreating from worldly affairs**, is **praised by his neighbors** and **honored by the court**, then to **discard form and abandon wisdom**, **forsaking the world to stand alone**, he must indeed be able to **endure long**—this is clear.\n\nIs it not because he lacks selfishness? Thus he can fulfill his own selfishness. Heaven **covers without selfishness**, Earth **bears without selfishness**; the Sage **unites with Heaven and Earth in virtue/power**, and while all others perish, he alone survives. While all else wither, he alone thrives—is this not the fulfillment of his selfishness?\n\nCheng Taizhi said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure long because they can fulfill their own selfishness.\"* The later chapter states that humans can attain **long life and prolonged vision** because they **harness the years** and **make them eternal**. But if Heaven and Earth’s **eternal generation**, what does it mean to speak of **long years**?\n\nThe *I Ching* says: *\"Eternal generation is called the **Dao/Way**.\"* It is the **source of generation** that gives birth, and the **Dao/Way** that further generates from it—this is called **eternal generation**. Extending this analogy, the **crawfish (生)**, the **elderly (耆)**, and the **great enterprise (大业)**—all that is called **generation** refers to **augmenting what is not yet present**.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not generate themselves yet can **prolong this generation eternally**; this aligns with *Liezi*’s claim: *\"The **Dao/Way of eternal generation** does not generate itself, for its **Dao/Way is unfathomable**.\"* This is precisely the elaboration of that principle.\n\nAll things under Heaven are born from **substance (有)**, and **substance** arises from **non-substance (无)**. Heaven and Earth’s ability to generate all things stems from their **constant presence**, yet they never **enter into generation themselves**. Vast and decaying, they **bestow their qi** upon countless varieties, forming them.\n\nHeaven and Earth, however, **do not increase** over the ages—thus all they possess is **without loss**, all they grant is **without destruction**. Hence, they can **generate all things under Heaven** yet **never exhaust themselves**.\n\n*Liezi* further says: *\"That which is generated from generation dies, yet the **Dao/Way of eternal generation** never ends. That which takes form from form solidifies, yet the **Dao/Way of formless transformation** never remains.\"* This is the ultimate extension of that principle.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **preserves his body while fulfilling his virtue/power**. The later chapter indeed clarifies this principle, saying: *\"The Sage desires to surpass others by his words, yet he acts beneath them; desires to precede others by his actions, yet his body lags behind.\"* Thus, when he **occupies a high position**, others do not **resent him**; when he **takes the lead**, others do not **harm him**. Hence, the world **delights in pushing him forward without tiring**.\n\nTo **postpone one’s body yet have it endure first** is to **sacrifice oneself to benefit others**, and also to **refrain from contention while none can contend with him**. This principle originates from Heaven and Earth’s **not generating themselves** yet **prolonging their generation eternally**. To **transcend one’s body yet preserve it**.\n\nHumans **love their bodies** without distinction—whether noble or base, wise or foolish, all are the same. Yet if they love without **embodying the Dao/Way**, they **seek to benefit yet cause harm**. Laozi says: *\"People’s disregard for death is due to their excessive attachment to life.\"* Meaning they **cherish it so heavily** that they **do not spare themselves** in nurturing it, even to the point of inviting death.\n\nHe also says: *\"To **augment life** is called **auspicious (祥)**.\"* Meaning they **exert finite wisdom** to **pursue what life does not inherently possess**, thus **inviting disaster (祸)**. If one **excessively nurtures life** yet **loses the Dao/Way of natural generation**, and **seeks to augment life** through artificial means, then in terms of **loving one’s body**, one can say he **spares no effort**.\n\nYet, if one **pursues honor and nourishment**, he may **invite death**; if one **seeks to augment life**, he may **bring misfortune**. This is precisely because he **does not understand the principle of yielding to curves** but instead **demands straight paths**.\n\nAs for the Sage’s **preservation of his body**, there is indeed a **Dao/Way**. Knowing that **life’s coming cannot be repelled** and its **departure cannot be halted**, he **abandons worldly affairs** to **free himself from burdens**, thus attaining **equilibrium and balance**. The **Dao/Way of equilibrium and balance** is **without partiality or favor**, **without striving or envy**, and thus **Zhuangzi’s theory of life is illuminated**.\n\nIf **lowering oneself does not harm life** and **elevating oneself does not benefit life**, then what was said earlier—*\"its coming cannot be repelled\"*—does it not apply to me? **Having abandoned it, where else can it go?** Thus, his ability to **transcend this body** is precisely his means to **attain preservation**.\n\nLaozi deeply understood the **mysteries of the Dao/Way**, and all his words were **expressions of the formless**. His teachings are **not easily grasped in a single glance**, yet he **never spoke in plain terms**. He often **veiled his truth within words** while **concealing his intent beyond them**, akin to later ages’ **hidden doctrines**.\n\nThis was **not to startle the world**. If one **raises a corner** yet **does not reflect the whole**, then even if he **instructs earnestly**, it **brings no benefit**. The rest follows similarly.\n\nIs it not because he lacks selfishness? Thus he can fulfill his own selfishness.»\n\n「Thus, he could fulfill his own selfishness. The principles of the world are such that **unity** with the multitude makes them **public**, while **partiality** toward oneself makes them **private**—yet it is not necessary to **encroach upon others** for self-gain that defines selfishness. When he **positions himself** after others, yet **his actions** precede them as if without intent, his **virtue/power** naturally preserves itself. If he **acts from behind** yet others **follow him first**, as though without design, yet his **virtue/power** remains intact, then it is not by his lack of selfishness that he **fulfills his own selfishness**.\n\nZhān Qiū Pǔ said: \"Heaven and Earth endure long, **thus** they can fulfill their own selfishness.\" The *Tāo Guāng Zhāng* speaks of **concealing brilliance** to nurture clarity, thereby prolonging its radiance. Thus, Heaven and Earth endure long because they **do not selfishly assert their own virtue/power**, and in the grand **virtue/power** of **generation**, they can achieve **longevity**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **embodies the law** of Heaven and Earth: he **acts from behind** yet his **virtue/power** stands first, **externalizes himself** yet his **virtue/power** remains firmly preserved. Is this not because his lack of selfishness allows him to **fulfill his own selfishness**? It is all through **concealing brilliance** and not **boasting of his light** that this is so.\n\nZhāng Chōng replied: \"Heaven and Earth endure long because they **do not selfishly assert their own virtue/power**.\" Heaven’s clarity **endures and covers** all things, long-lasting and unshaken; Earth’s depth **bears and sustains**, enduring and unyielding. Why is this? Because Heaven **endures without selfishly generating its own presence**, it **forgets its own celestial form** yet **covers all things**, the Dao **silently operating** without excess, and Heaven **naturally** endures. Earth **endures without selfishly generating its own substance**, it **forgets its own earthly shape** yet **sustains all things**, the Dao **silently operating** without ceasing, and Earth **naturally** endures. What is meant by **not selfishly generating** is that the Dao **generates itself within me**, silently operating without end, yet **I do not seek its source in my own generation**, so Heaven **forms without form** and Earth **substances without shape**—thus their enduring nature.\n\nThe Sage is the one who **perfects the Dao** in the world. Knowing how Heaven and Earth endure, he **aligns his body with the Dao**, not making the Dao his own body. He **honors others** yet does not **honor himself**, so others honor him while he himself remains honored. He **bestows generosity** upon others yet does not **hoard it for himself**, so others grow rich while he himself remains rich. By **humbling and diminishing himself**, he **precedes others** while **preserving his own virtue/power**—this is the **function of concealing brilliance and not selfishly generating**.\n\nIf he **conceals yet acts**, as though from **no selfishness**, but **reflects upon it** and finds **fulfillment for himself**, then what is said of him is indeed **selfishness for himself**. Those who **study the Dao** must **reverse-track its concealed brilliance**.\n\nBái Yù Chán said: \"Heaven and Earth endure long. **Silently without action**.\" Heaven and Earth endure long because **they are thus**. The heart is also so. Because **it does not selfishly generate**, the heart **endures long**. Thus, one can achieve **longevity**. It is **originally without birth or death**. Therefore, the Sage: **I am the same**. I **act from behind** yet my **virtue/power** stands first, **present without absence**. I **externalize myself** yet my **virtue/power** remains preserved—**such is the way of all time**. Is it not because of his **lack of selfishness**? Heaven and Earth share the same **root** with me; all things share the same **body** with me. Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness. **I am Heaven and Earth**; Heaven and Earth are **I**. Liào Cuìrán said: \"Heaven and Earth endure long because **spirit is born from form**, and form can **perfect spirit**. When form and spirit **harmonize**, they **prolong endlessly**. Heaven and Earth endure long because **form and spirit are both immortal**. It is because **they do not selfishly generate**. Form cannot be without spirit to **generate**, spirit cannot be without form to **perfect**. Thus, one can achieve **longevity**. Thus, they **mutually generate** and **mutually perfect**. From ancient times to today, their **name** does not fade.\n\nTherefore, the Sage: **master of affairs and people**, I am the same. I **act from behind** yet my **virtue/power** stands first—**humble yet exalted, radiant**. I **externalize myself** yet my **virtue/power** remains preserved—**retreat and hide in secrecy**, like a hen brooding her eggs. Is it not because of his **lack of selfishness**? **Originally without attachment**, yet **all emotions are obtained**. Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness. When **public affairs are managed**, then **private affairs are also managed**. Form and spirit **both achieve perfection**, and **harmonize with the Dao**. Chén Bìxū said: \"Heaven and Earth endure long—**this is the standard**. Heaven, with its **vast qi**, covers all things, **unshaken from ancient to modern times**, hence called **enduring**. Earth, with its **substantial form**, bears all things, **permanently fixed from beginning to end**, hence called **unyielding**. The **analogy** is used to **establish meaning**, found in the following text.\n\nWhy Heaven and Earth endure long—**this is the question**. Because **they do not selfishly generate**, **this is the explanation**. Thus, they can achieve **longevity**—**this concludes the meaning**. Heaven endures in **clarity**, Earth endures in **tranquility**, because they **cover and bear all things**, **nurture and educate all beings**, yet all **draw their nature from the wondrous source**, returning to their **original emptiness**, restoring their **mysterious depths**, and **not boasting of their own generative function**, while **preserving their constant virtue/power**, thus they endure.\n\nAnother interpretation says: Heaven and Earth, along with all things, **stand alone yet transform naturally**. All **receive their nature without seeking** to **exceedingly benefit their own generation**, thus they endure. **This is a warning to be heeded**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **arrives yet his virtue/power remains preserved**. The Sage **does nothing**, yet **his body is in the hall of state** while his **heart wanders in Gūshè**. He **embodies Heaven and Earth’s covering and bearing**, **nourishing all without selfishness**, greatly **acting in humility** yet **not daring to lead the world first**. His people **rejoice and support him** without **burdening him**, **delight in promoting him** without **wearying him**, hence his **virtue/power stands first**. Again, he **forgets his deeds and his name**, **externalizes his body and few desires**, and the world **loves him as a parent**, the **spirits and luminous ones** **assist him like a cherished child**, hence his **virtue/power remains preserved**. Is it not because of his **lack of selfishness**? Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness. Heaven and Earth **generate and nurture all things**, yet the Sage **externalizes himself to perfect the people**. All **do not use their benevolence to selfishly expand**, how could there be a **selfish heart**? It is truly **without selfishness**. Without selfishness, he can **endure long and remain steadfast**; because of his **longevity and endurance**, he knows how to **fulfill his own selfishness**.\n\nLǐ Yuē said: \"He who **does not selfishly assert himself** yet **selfishly benefits others**—when others’ selfishness is fulfilled, his own selfishness is already fulfilled.\"\n\n*The **Honglie Exegesis** states:*\n\nWhen **Gongyi Xiu** served as minister of **Lu** and craved fish, the entire state presented him with fish. **Gongyi Xiu** refused to accept them. His disciple remonstrated: *\"Master, you love fish—why refuse them?\"* He replied: *\"Precisely because I love fish, I refuse them. If I accept the fish and lose my ministerial post, even if I love fish, I cannot sustain myself with them. If I refuse the fish and do not lose my post, then I can forever sustain my love of fish.\"* This demonstrates his understanding of **serving others while benefiting oneself**. Hence it is said: *\"Is it not because of his lack of selfishness? Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness.\"*\n\n**Xie Tunan** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they attain longevity. Heaven’s height and Earth’s depth—born from the **Great Ultimate**, reaching the **Boundless**—truly endure long and steadfast. This is so because Heaven and Earth take **nurturing all things** as their heart; they never seek to sustain themselves, hence their eternal life. Therefore, when the Sage arrives, his body is preserved. The Sage follows Heaven and Earth, taking **nurturing the myriad people** as his heart. He places his own body last, not acting for himself, yet his body is always foremost. He externalizes his body, not possessing it himself, yet his body is always preserved. This is why he can stand alongside Heaven and Earth. Is it not because of his lack of selfishness? Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness. Heaven and Earth do not sustain themselves—this is lack of selfishness. Yet the sun, moon, stars, and constellations depend upon them; the **Hua Mountains**, rivers, and seas bear them—is this not fulfilling their own selfishness? The Sage does not act for himself—this is lack of selfishness—yet the state and the world are at peace, ancestral temples and altars are honored—is this not fulfilling his own selfishness? The utmost fairness is an unalterable principle; this is the **Dao of enduring longevity**. Heaven, Earth, and the Sage all adhere to this. Indeed, examining the principles of the world, only fairness prevails. Heaven covers without selfishness, Earth bears without selfishness; the **Sage** governs with fairness to labor for the people. The **Classics** say: *'Fairness is kingship; kingship is Heaven; Heaven is the **Dao**; the **Dao** endures.'* Thus, Heaven, Earth, and the Sage all stand together in the world through this utmost fairness, hence their enduring longevity without exhaustion.\n\nLater ages, however, impoverished the lower to enrich the upper, starving the people to fatten themselves. **Qin Shihuang** flogged the world to unify the realm, and **Emperor Yang of Sui** swallowed bandits to monopolize the Central Plains—truly, they achieved their ambitions. Yet their dynasties collapsed within two generations, their ancestral temples ruined, their altars in ruins. Thus, the gains and losses of fairness and selfishness are evident.\n\n**Lin Yongqi** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* This chapter uses Heaven and Earth to illustrate the Sage’s **heart of no contrivance**. Heaven and Earth generate all things naturally, without contrivance, hence their ten thousand years pass like a single day. The Sage cultivates himself without contriving in precedence or sequence, without contriving in inner or outer—thus, though none precede him, he always endures. Hence, though he is without selfishness, he fulfills his own selfishness. This *\"selfishness\"* refers to his body’s preservation, not the selfishness of public and private. If *\"selfishness\"* were taken as public-private selfishness, then it could not be called **heart of no contrivance**. These words are **Laozi’s** way of guiding people toward goodness. When the **Buddhist school** reinterpreted them, such language vanished, hence they speak of **true emptiness, real existence**. True emptiness is the meaning of **lack of selfishness**; real existence is the meaning of **fulfilling his own selfishness**. Yet their phrasing, though lofty, is a layer removed.\n\n**Fan Yingyuan** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they attain longevity.\"* Among formed things, none endure like Heaven and Earth. Both arise from the **Dao**, hence their enduring longevity stems from their **resting in lack of selfishness**, not seeking to benefit themselves, thus they attain eternal life. **Riverbank Master** said: *\"This speaks of Heaven and Earth’s eternal life to instruct people.\"* Therefore, when the Sage arrives, his body is preserved. The Sage is humble and does not contend for precedence, yet people naturally revere him. The Sage does not contend, does not oppose things, yet nothing can harm him. Is it not because of his lack of selfishness? Thus, he fulfills his own selfishness. The Sage fulfills his own selfishness—not in crookedness, not in wickedness—but because common people seek to benefit themselves, hence they cannot attain precedence and preservation, while the Sage’s humility and non-contention alone enable him to attain precedence and preservation.\n\n**Xue Yongqi** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* Once form and number are complete, formation and decay are inevitable. Are Heaven and Earth truly enduring? Their enduring longevity comes from **generating without self-generation**, hence their eternal life. Humble yet radiant, low yet uncrossable—placing his body last, yet his body is foremost. Not burdened by death, life, wealth, or nobility, his spirit is whole; externalizing his body, yet his body is preserved. **Emperor Yao** ceded the realm to **Xuyou**, **Emperor Shun** to **Shan Jun**, because of their lack of selfishness, thus they fulfilled their own selfishness.\n\n**Restful Retreat Hermit** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* All formed things escape not the four **kalpas** of arising, dwelling, decay, and emptiness. Only Heaven and Earth endure because they do not self-generate. **Qi** emanates to manifest the **Two Principles**, true **qi** circulating without beginning or end, hence their eternal life. The Sage is the **Three Powers’** manifestation after Heaven and Earth, the world thus formed. **Body foremost**—his luminous true nature precedes the **Great Ultimate** yet is already present. **Externalizing his body, yet his body preserved**—if one establishes the world without clinging, this is called **body beyond things**; though the world decays, true nature does not decay.\n\n「Is it not because of their lack of selfishness? True nature differs from things, thus it can well fulfill its own selfishness.»\n\n**Chu Bo-xiu** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* Indeed, since the **cosmic chaos** (*hun-dun*) first divided, the light and clear ascend and float upward, while the heavy and turbid descend and sink downward. The **principle of existence and nonexistence** (*you-wu*) and the **vessel of Dao** (*dao-qi*) rely on each other to stand, spanning the ages without ceasing their transformative and generative processes—thus they endure. Why is this so? It is because they do not self-generate. To self-generate is to cling to self and fail to give birth to things; how could they then endure eternally?\n\nThe Sage manifests **body foremost** (*shen-xian*) and **body beyond things** (*wu-wai-shen*), merely abandoning selfishness for the sake of the public, emulating Heaven and following Earth’s ways to nourish the people and cultivate all things. All who practice humility, dwell in lowliness, do not presume to be first, decline merit and yield to ability, and retreat to preserve their whole—these are acts of **body foremost**. Yet when the world joyfully acclaims them, they cannot but assume the lead.\n\nTo dwell in humble thatched huts, eat coarse grasses, guard true nature while cherishing self, awaken from the dream of life and death—these are acts of **body beyond things**, yet they surpass the pursuit of noble life, and thus their preservation is inevitable.\n\nThe **gentleman** (*jun-zi*) does good, fulfilling what is rightfully his due. Does he seek reward for it? Heaven’s aid to the virtuous is without a shred of private intent; it follows by kindred nature, like an echo answering a call. The Sage embodies Heaven’s impartiality, follows the Dao’s generative virtue, fearing only that one thing might lose its place—thus Heaven’s response and divine blessings are complete. Though human affairs may seem to fulfill selfishness, in truth they arise from Heaven’s utmost impartiality; thus his blessings and rejoicings are without shame.\n\nWhen the **gentleman** receives blessings, is it not for his own honor? No—it is to extend virtue to the people, broadening Heaven and Earth’s **great virtue** (*da-de*). If one does good while harboring even a trace of selfish gain, then it is not true goodness; its end may even lead to evil. Can one not be cautious at its beginning?\n\n**Niu Miao-zhuan** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* Heaven is the accumulation of **yang** (*yang*), thus it can fulfill its function and cover all; it spans the ages without wearing down, hence it is called ‘long.’ Earth is the accumulation of **yin** (*yin*), thus it can fulfill its function and bear all; it endures through the **kalpas** without decay, hence it is called ‘durable.’ Yet why do they endure both long and durable? It is because Heaven and Earth do not presume to be able to endure; thus they endure. They do not presume to be able to fulfill their own selfishness; thus they fulfill it.\n\n**Lie Zi** said: *\"There is life that does not generate, and there is non-generation that can generate life. The generating cannot help but generate, thus it is always generating. Always generating is without a time that does not generate, but non-generation is singular. Singular non-generation—its Dao is unfathomable.\"* Is this not so?\n\nThus the Sage manifests **body foremost** and **body beyond things**. The Sage is the **humble gentleman** (*qian-qian jun-zi*). Why is this so? Did not Confucius say, *\"The Sage—whom I cannot see, but if I see a gentleman, that is enough\"*? Those who do not dare to be first, but instead place themselves after others—are they not the **humble gentlemen**?\n\n**Lao Zi** said: *\"He who does not dare to be first under Heaven can thus fulfill his function and endure.\"* Confucius also said: *\"First act according to your words, then follow them.\"* In ancient times, **Hu Qiu Zi Lin** told **Lie Zi**: *\"If you know how to hold back, then you can know how to hold yourself.\"* **Lie Zi** said: *\"I wish to hear of holding back.\"* He replied: *\"Look at your shadow, and you will know.\"* The ancients referred to \"you\" as \"shadow.\"\n\n**Lie Zi** looked back and observed his shadow: when his form bent, the shadow curved; when his form straightened, the shadow stood upright. Thus, bending and straightening follow his form, not his shadow; yielding and extending follow things, not himself. This is called **holding back while assuming the lead**.\n\nIs this not the saying? **Body beyond things** preserves itself.\n\nThe **body** is but the **manifestation** (*wei-xing*) of Heaven and Earth’s entrusted form, thus Dao encompasses the **Four Great Elements** (*si-da*), and **virtue** fulfills the **Five Constants** (*wu-chang*), making it the most **spirited** of all things. Those who value their **body** place merit and fame beyond consideration, store Heaven’s principle within their chests—thus they can preserve their **body**, safeguard their life, and complete their years.\n\nIf one flaunts their talents and covets fame, then they cannot escape the afflictions of the **body**. The ancients said: *\"Straight wood is felled first; sweet wells run dry first. The elephant loses its life for its tusks; the fragrant pine is burned for its scent.\"* **Zhuang Zi** said: *\"When achievements are complete, the vessel is broken; when fame is attained, the virtue is lost.\"* Who can abandon fame and achievement, returning to share with the common people?\n\n**Lao Zi** said: *\"He who externalizes Heaven and Earth has Heaven and Earth; he who externalizes his body has longevity.\"* This is the saying.\n\nIn the present age, many **gentlemen** endanger their **body** and abandon their life—is this not tragic? Is it not because of their lack of selfishness that they fulfill their own selfishness?\n\nThis is truly speaking of the Sage’s **body foremost** and **body beyond things**, not of one who acts without mind. When the Sage assumes **body foremost** and **body beyond things** to fulfill the policies of the Sage, it is indeed due to the operation of selfishness—thus it is called *fulfill their own selfishness*.\n\nThe **lack of selfishness** is to say **non-action** (*wu-wei*). *Fulfilling their own selfishness* is **action** (*you-wei*). Moreover, there is no affair under Heaven that can be accomplished without action or achieved without effort. **Non-action** is the Sage’s **true nature** (*ti*); **action** is the Sage’s **application** (*yong*). When **true nature** and **application** are both complete, only then does the Sage’s Dao manifest—how could one cling to **non-action** and hinder *fulfilling their own selfishness*?\n\nIf a person lacks selfishness, then how do they differ from **clay and wooden figures** (*tu-mu ou-ren*)? **Lao Zi** said: *\"If one speaks of ‘no mind,’ then Dao itself has no mind. It is still one layer of mountain apart.\"* This is truly speaking of knowing **true nature** but not **application**.\n\n**Yang Zhi-ren** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* Heaven’s **emptiness** (*xu*) reaches its utmost, thus it endures; Earth’s **thick bearing** (*hou-zai*) is vast, thus it is durable. Because they do not self-generate, they rely on the **rotation of the sun and moon** (*ri-yue xuan-zhuan*) to generate, thus they can fulfill their own selfishness. If Heaven did not rotate, the sun and moon would not shine; if Earth were to dry up, all things would not generate.\n\nThe **human body**—its **inherent nature** (*ben-xing*) is called Heaven; its **original mandate** (*yuan-ming*) is called Earth.\n\nIf **life and nature** are both preserved and cultivated according to the Dao, one may endure as long as Heaven and Earth.\n\nThus, the virtuous person practices humility, retreat, and self-effacement, placing themselves last, yet others revere them and they lead by example. Those who can cultivate the **outer body** beyond the body, who know the **spirit within the spirit**, the **true nature within nature**, and the **Dao within the Dao**, are those who can transcend the body and attain eternal preservation.\n\nIs it not because the Sage achieves this through their **public virtue and selflessness**? Hence, by being selfless yet abundant, they fulfill their own **selfishness**.\n\n*The Doctrine of the Mean* states:\n*\"The utmost sincerity knows no exhaustion. Without exhaustion, it endures; enduring, it manifests; manifesting, the heart becomes vast and enduring. Vast and enduring, it becomes lofty and bright. Vast and enduring—this is what bears all things. Lofty and bright—this is what covers all things. Vast and enduring—this is what completes all things. Vast and enduring correspond to Earth; lofty and bright correspond to Heaven; vast and enduring are boundless. Thus, it shines without being seen, transforms without moving, and achieves without action. The Dao of Heaven and Earth can be fully expressed in a single word.\"*\n\nYù Qīngzhōng said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* Heaven, with its **primordial qi** (*yīyuán zhī qì*), circulates across the **four directions** without interruption or cessation, hence its endurance. Earth, in its **submissive form**, bears all things and remains constant, lacking nothing and leaning on nothing, hence its durability. Yet what enables their eternal endurance?\n\nIt is because they generate all things without claiming credit. All things cannot generate themselves; they must rely on Heaven and Earth for their existence. Heaven and Earth do not take credit for generating all things but grow alongside them. Thus, the generator of all things is Heaven and Earth, and their **eternal generation** is what allows all things to thrive. **Eternal life** is spoken of when generation is mentioned, for endurance is inherent within it.\n\nThe heart of Heaven and Earth is a heart of **universal impartiality**. The Sage embodies this universal impartiality of Heaven and Earth, placing themselves after Heaven and Earth yet leading in heart. They place themselves last, yet others revere them first.\n\nNot possessing what they have, they preserve it. They transcend the body, yet the body endures. Is this not because selflessness enables such attainment? Selflessness is universality—only the selfless can truly fulfill their own selfishness. Those who embody the **Heavenly Mandate** naturally return to it, without expectation or contrivance. Though it seems selfish, it is truly universal.\n\nXū Liùxū said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they attain eternal life.\"* Heaven’s endurance and Earth’s durability—this is the central theme of this passage. What follows is its elucidation. Yet by reasoning that they do not generate themselves, one concludes that Heaven and Earth endure and last because they do not contrive their own existence. If Heaven and Earth had a self-serving intent to prolong their lives, how could they truly endure?\n\nThus, when the Sage arrives, the body is preserved. The Sage places themselves last, yet others revere them first, following the Dao of Heaven and Earth in not generating themselves. They hold fast to humility and retreat, so the world naturally honors them as first. Those who transcend the body know that the body is not truly theirs; through **non-action, tranquility, and emptiness**, nothing can harm them. The body is naturally transcended—not by deliberate effort, but by natural detachment. Thus, the body is preserved.\n\nIs this not because of their selflessness? Hence, they fulfill their own selfishness.\n\nThe Sages attain **leading by example and eternal preservation** because they follow the Dao of Heaven and Earth in not generating themselves, not by selfish intent. Thus, they achieve the fulfillment of **leading by example and eternal preservation**.\n\nChái Yuángāo said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally—unchangeably.\"* Heaven and Earth endure because they fulfill their roles of covering and bearing all things, shaping forms naturally without contrivance. Thus, when the Sage arrives, the body is preserved. They diminish themselves to enrich others; others naturally honor them. They abandon self for the benefit of all, yet do not take from others. They do not act selfishly, yet fulfill their own selfishness. They forget their own selfish desires and fulfill the expectations of others. This is how the Sage aligns with the enduring Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nSū Jìngjìng said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* Since ancient times, none have matched Heaven and Earth in endurance. Yet who truly understands why Heaven and Earth endure? The **Supreme Ultimate Dao** truly generates them, yet Heaven and Earth do not generate themselves. If they were to grow alongside all things, they would merely be one thing among many—how could they then attain eternal life?\n\nHeaven and Earth stand above all things, yet do not compete with them, thus they endure eternally. The Sage understands this, always placing the world before themselves and their body last. When the people are hungry, they dare not indulge in satiety while others starve; when the people are cold, they dare not wear heavy garments while others shiver. They treat the people with the intimacy of father and son, yet do not dare to neglect them as distant relatives; they treat them as brothers, yet do not dare to exclude them.\n\nThough the Sage places themselves last, the world reveres them first. Though they transcend the body, the world preserves them. Just as Heaven and Earth, by not generating themselves, endure eternally in their generation, so too does the Sage, by placing themselves last and transcending the body, not dare to act selfishly for their own sake. Yet the people wish to honor the Sage’s body, to preserve the Sage’s life. The Sage wishes to retreat, yet the people honor them first; the Sage wishes to transcend, yet the people preserve them. Is this not fulfilling their own selfishness?\n\nThus, it is known that those who are not self-serving are truly able to fulfill their selfishness.\n\nBěn Yī’ān Chúshì said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* To complete all things is to complete oneself. Common people see the self and others as distinct, thus they eagerly seek to fulfill their selfishness. Yet those who are selfish ultimately gain no benefit, while those who are selfless paradoxically achieve self-fulfillment. This is the natural order.\n\nNow, consider how Heaven and Earth treat all things: they scatter with wind and nourish with rain, stir with thunder and illuminate with sun and moon. All is done solely for the sake of generating all things.\n\nThe movement and circulation of all things never cease—\nthis is how they endure eternally.\n\nThe Sage’s governance diminishes the high to benefit the low,\nsets aside the self to follow others.\nYet when the people are amply provided for, who is there to suffer want?\nThere has never been one who, being kind, abandoned their kin,\nor who, upholding righteousness, delayed serving their lord—\nwhat greater benefit could there be?\n\nIf people understand this, they may broaden their vision beyond the self\nand expand their heart toward the great public good.\n\nStone Pool [said]: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally.*\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can endure so long is that they do not generate themselves—\nthus they attain eternal life.\nTherefore, the Sage places himself last, yet his worth is foremost;\nsets himself aside, yet his essence remains.\nIs this not because of their lack of selfishness?\nThus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"\n\nYet interpretations of this passage differ.\nThe ancients held that Heaven and Earth’s eternal life was like a person’s longevity—\ntheir enduring existence.\nModern commentators argue that *generating* refers to generating all things,\nmeaning Heaven and Earth merely generate others without generating themselves—\nwhat is called ‘not generating yet generating generation.’\n\nHowever, examining the latter passage, both interpretations have merit.\nWhen it speaks of ‘placing himself last’ and ‘setting himself aside,’\nthis is the generation of all things.\nWhen it speaks of ‘his worth being foremost’ and ‘his essence remaining,’\nthis is the generation of longevity.\nIf we speak of their lack of selfishness, it is the generation of all things.\nIf we speak of fulfilling their selfishness, it is the generation of longevity.\n\nTo unify these, the ‘not generating themselves’ refers to generating all things,\nwhile ‘eternal life’ pertains to longevity.\nThough Heaven and Earth cannot be spoken of in terms of life and death,\ntheir enduring existence is eternal life itself.\n\nEvaluating thus, Laozi’s intent is precisely that Heaven and Earth,\nby generating all things without selfishness, attain eternal endurance.\nIf people can abandon selfishness to seek life,\nthey too may endure eternally.\n\nYet Laozi’s teaching truly seeks eternal life—\nwhy then does he speak thus?\nFundamentally, this passage connects with the later chapter on *Entering and Exiting Life and Death*.\nFor people’s pursuit of life often harms it—\nlike trampling seedlings to hasten growth—\nleading to self-destruction, as if driving them to their death.\nOnly by nurturing gently, without excessive effort,\nas indicated in the *Spirit of the Upper Valley* chapter,\ncan one attain eternal life without striving for it.\n\n*(End of Volume Twelve of *Collected Meanings of the Dao De Jing*)\n#1 *Wuqi wuqi*: The *Liezi*’s *Heavenly

Virtue of Water** (考异: *He Shang Gong*’s *Chapter on Changing Nature*, Zhao Shixian’s *Chapter on Gentle Compliance and Rectifying Justice*)\n\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary:**\nThe preceding chapter illuminated the Way’s boundless virtue—Heaven and Earth are without selfishness, thus enduring forever.\nThis chapter clarifies that the Sage, like water in its gentle flow, incurs no blame.\nIt begins with the metaphor of water, showing how its three virtues approach the Dao.\nNext, it states that water dwells in the lowly, embodying the seven supreme qualities in benefiting all.\nIt concludes with *not contending*, urging adherence to gentleness to preserve ultimate victory.\n\nDu Guangting says:\nWater’s virtue is gentle and yielding, serene and harmonious,\ndwelling in compliance, flowing downward—\nswelling or dispersing with the seasons, adapting to vessels’ shapes,\nbecoming springs or scattering as mist and dew.\nAll things lose it and die; gain it and live.\nStrike it and it is unharmed; grasp it and it slips away.\nYet it does not fully reach the Dao,\nfor water has form while the Dao is formless.\nThough form may hinder, in its virtue of benefiting all\nand its humble use, water nears the Dao.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* uses water as an analogy\nto exhort those cultivating the Dao,\nurging them to embody the seven virtues and three abilities,\nto refine their person and govern the realm,\nwhile preserving the virtue of *not contending*—\nthus avoiding blame or fault.\n\nZhang Chongying responds:\nThis *nature* refers to the character one cultivates after growth.\nHumans inherit the *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nand originally have no vice—\nbut as they grow, emotions disrupt them,\nstirring the five desires,\nand their nature becomes mostly unvirtuous.\nThus, people abandon the Dao and ruin themselves,\nyet fail to repent.\nThis chapter admonishes those who let their cultivated nature run wild,\nurging them to restrain it\nand thereby advance toward the Dao.\nFor its virtue is like water’s:\nWater benefits all things without contending,\ndwelling where others abhor.\nThus it nearly attains the Dao.\n\nIt dwells in the lowly—\nWater’s nature is pure,\nflowing over earth’s grass and trees,\nthen descending—\nakin to the receptive yielding of the female.\nIts heart is deep—\nWater is profound and empty,\nits depths clear and luminous.\nIts giving is benevolent—\nAll things receive water and flourish;\nit fills the void, never the full.\nIts speech is trustworthy—\nWater’s inner reflection reveals truth,\nits form never betraying its essence.\nIts governance is harmonious—\nIt cleanses all without exception.\nIts deeds are accomplished—\nIt adapts to square or round,\nbending or straightening as needed.\nIts movement is timely—\nIt disperses in summer, congeals in winter,\nacting in accordance with the seasons.\nOnly because it does not contend,\nit incurs no blame.\nThus, the world finds no fault with water.\n\nWang Fusi says:\nThe Sage’s virtue, like water, nears the Dao—\nHumans abhor the lowly,\nyet water, dwelling there, nearly attains the Dao.\nThe Dao lacks what water has,\nthus it is called *nearly*.\n\nWater’s dwelling in the lowly extends to its virtue of *no blame*—\nThis shows that water conforms to this Dao.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong says:\nThe Sage’s virtue, like water—\nThis illustrates the Sage’s supreme virtue.\nThus, water’s nature is used as the analogy nearing the Dao.\n**Commentary:**\n*Supreme virtue* refers to the Sage’s conduct.\n*Like water* is metaphor.\nThe Sage’s actions embody water’s virtues,\nall detailed below, each containing a deeper meaning.\n\nWater’s virtue benefits all, even where others abhor—\n**Commentary:**\nWater is sweet and deep,\nspreading everywhere,\nnourishing what it touches—\nthose who receive its blessings grow,\nthus it is called *beneficial*.\nThis is its first ability.\n\nNo thing is softer than water,\nyet it can be modeled—\nclear, it reflects truth;\nflowing, it fills valleys,\ncarrying all in its current—\nit brings harmony where others seek it,\nyet never contends.\nThis is its second ability.\n\nOthers shun the lowly and impure,\nyet water accepts it,\ndwelling in filth without complaint.\nThis is its third ability.\nThus it nearly attains the Dao.\n\n*Near* means *close*.\n**Commentary:**\nIts benefiting all is manifest,\nits not contending shows gentleness,\nits dwelling in filth demonstrates tolerance—\nthese are water’s three abilities.\nOnly the Sage consistently embodies them,\nthus his conduct nears the Dao without straying far.\nHence, it is said *close*.\n\nIt dwells in the lowly—\nThe Sage’s person is gentle and yielding,\nlike water’s flowing downward,\nnourishing all.\nEarth’s nature is lowly,\nyet water favors descending there.\n**Commentary:**\nThe Sage’s dwelling is beneficial,\nlike water’s flowing on earth—\nthe more it benefits, the greater its virtue.\nEarth’s virtue lies in its lowliness,\nand water descends naturally.\nThis mirrors the Sage’s humility,\nnearing the Dao’s gentle nature,\nthus it is said *dwelling in the lowly*.\n\nIts heart is deep—\nThe Sage’s mind is profound and still,\nlike water’s resting in springs.\n**Commentary:**\nThe Sage’s mind excels in tranquility,\nlike water’s nature—\ncalm, it becomes clear;\nat ease, it attains insight.\n*Springs* symbolize deep stillness.\nThus it is said *heart is deep*.\n\nIts giving is benevolent—\nHis generosity aligns with supreme benevolence,\nlike water’s nourishing all things.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe Supreme Benevolence of boundless aid\nalways gives to others,\nand its generous deeds align with virtuous conduct,\nlike water nourishing all—\nwithout favor or aversion.\nThus it is said: *giving is transformative*.\n\n**On truthful speech:**\nWords must be sincere and true,\nlike water flowing through perilous paths—\nnever failing in its constancy.\n**Commentary:**\nThe Superior Person’s speech is ever true,\nguiding the common folk,\ntruthful without deceit,\nlike springs that flow—\nhow could they differ in their steadfastness?\nThus it is said: *speech is truthful*.\n\n**On skillful governance:**\nTo govern well is to regulate,\nlike water cleansing all things,\nmaking them pure and cool.\n**Commentary:**\nGovernance means rectification.\nThe Superior Person, in all actions,\nacts without contrivance,\nrectifies appearance to enlighten beings—\nbeings follow what is rectified,\nand rectification brings order.\nWhat could be better than this?\nLike water’s nature, cleansing all things,\nmaking them pure.\nThus it is said: *governance is skillful*.\n\n**On capable action:**\nIn all undertakings, one adapts with ease,\nlike water’s nature—\nsquare in a square vessel, round in a round one,\nnever hindered by form.\n**Commentary:**\nThe Superior Person is all-encompassing,\nunobstructed by things.\nWhatever moves or acts,\nall matters are traversed—\ntraversed, thus capable.\nThis is clarity and insight.\nLike water’s nature—\nwhen it flows as rivers,\nwhen dammed, it becomes earth;\nfloating boats, embracing emptiness—\nwhat it cannot do?\nThis is capability.\nThus it is said: *action is capable*.\n\n**On timely response:**\nThings move and one responds,\nnever missing the moment.\nLike water’s thawing in spring and freezing in winter.\n**Commentary:**\nThe Superior Person’s heart\nis like an empty valley,\na mirror’s reflection—\nwhen things stir, it responds.\nLike water’s nature—\nthawing in spring, freezing in winter,\nrising and falling with the seasons.\nThus it is said: *response is timely*.\n\n**On non-contention:**\nOnly the non-contending\nhas no blame.\nThe Superior Person, with a vacant heart,\nfollows things naturally,\nlike water—\nwhen dammed, it flows elsewhere.\nIt never opposes things,\nthus there is no blame.\n**Commentary:**\nBlame means fault.\nThe Superior Person’s conduct\nharms no being,\nvacant-hearted and complete,\nnever competing—\nwaves ebb and flow,\nyielding thus,\nnever opposing things,\nso there is no blame.\nDu Guangting says:\n*The Superior is like water.*\nThe Superior cultivates the Dao and refines the heart,\nadapting to changes with the times,\nmoving freely to benefit beings.\nThe Master Lao wished to reveal the Superior’s virtue\nto encourage later learners,\ncomparing water to the Dao,\nthus using water as an analogy.\nThe Superior’s goodness\nforgets its own goodness,\nlike water not boasting of its deeds—\nwater’s deeds are greater when unboasted,\nvirtue shines brighter when unvaunted.\nGreat and bright,\nthis is the highest goodness.\n\nFrom the sovereign on high\nto the recluse in the rocks,\nif one is like water,\nthen the Dao is attained.\nThe analogy uses water as metaphor,\nthe Dao as principle,\nand the Superior Person as its practitioner.\n\nWater excels in benefiting what others despise.\nSweetness is water’s flavor.\nDepth is water’s essence.\nWater is the mother of *qi*,\nruling the North,\nits virtue is to nourish below.\nIts color is black,\nits nature is wisdom,\nits taste is salty,\nits number is six.\nThe North is the beginning of Yang virtue,\nthe end of Yin *qi*.\nIts generative number is one,\nmatching the Dao.\nThe Dao is also one—\nthe one without a one,\nwater is also one—\nthe one with a one.\nThe one without a one is the Dao’s essence,\nthe one with a one is the Dao’s function.\nThus, water is the Dao’s function.\nAll things rely on its nourishment to flourish,\nand because it nourishes,\nit gives rise to all things,\nthus it ranks first among the three capabilities.\n\nGentleness is water’s virtue.\n*The Dao De Jing*, Chapter 41, says:\n*Nothing in the world is softer than water,*\n*yet it overcomes the hardest things.*\nAgain, water’s virtue is emphasized to encourage embracing gentleness.\n\nWater, when level, does not flow;\nlaw follows equanimity as its foundation,\nthus it can be emulated.\nWater’s stillness reflects things.\nHence it is said:\n*No one mirrors themselves in flowing water,*\n*but in still water.*\nBecause it is clear and tranquil.\nWater’s nature is level—\nwhen encountering unevenness, it passes;\nwhen meeting marshes, it stops.\nEast, west, south, north—\nit follows where it is led,\nnever contending with others,\nnothing it cannot traverse.\nComparing all virtues,\nit is said its generative function is unmatched,\nthus it ranks second among the three capabilities.\n\nHuman nature follows convention for the many,\nbut few are humble and yielding.\nMost love high positions,\nfearing lowly ones.\nOnly water\ndwells low without contention,\nresides in filth without shame.\nCompared to the previous virtues,\nthis one surpasses them,\nthus it ranks third among the three capabilities.\nThus it nears the Dao.\n\nIf the ruler embodies the virtue of boundless aid,\nholds a humble and yielding heart,\nand practices containing impurity,\nthen the world will be at peace.\nFor those cultivating the self,\ntheir efforts extend to all things—\ngentleness governs nature,\ndwelling in filth to follow the common,\nabandoning traces while humbly shining,\nthen immortality may be hoped for.\n\n**On dwelling in the lowly:**\nThis clarifies delighting in humility\nas the way to preserve the state and body.\nThe sky’s purity and lightness\nmake it use its height,\nthe earth’s turbidity and thickness\nmake it rest in lowliness.\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*The sky is exalted, the earth is lowly,*\n*low and high are arranged.*\nAgain:\n*The earth’s way is low yet ascends.*\nWater follows lowliness and dwells beneath,\nmirroring the Superior’s humble virtue.\n\n**On a profound heart:**\nThis clarifies clarity, tranquility, and emptiness\nas the method for purifying the self and washing the heart.\n*A minister’s heart is like water,*\n*a minister’s gate is like a market.*\nIs this not so?\n\n**On generous giving:**\nThis clarifies nourishing all things\nas the conduct of universal aid and rescue.\nThe more one gives to others,\nthe more one possesses;\nthe more one gives away,\nthe more one has.\nThis is the meaning.\n\n**On truthful speech:**\nThis clarifies sincerity without deceit\nas the eternal and verified teaching.\n*Flowing through peril does not lose its truth*—\n*The Book of Changes*, the *Kàn* hexagram, says:\n*Habitual Kàn—*\n*double peril.*\n\n「Water flows yet never overflows,\n*it moves through peril without losing its truth.*\n\n**On governing the state and nurturing the people:**\nTo lead by the Dao/Way, one must first embody it oneself—\nspeaking only what is true and sincere,\nso as to stir the heavens and earth,\nand awaken the luminous spirits.\nThus, words of good and evil arise within a single chamber,\nyet echo across a thousand leagues—\n*this is the utmost truthfulness.*\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Remove food and arms, yet let truthfulness remain.\"*\n*How profound his words were!*\n\n**On virtuous governance:**\nThis clarifies the true and authentic transformation of all things,\nas the method to transcend the ordinary and attain the sage’s path.\n\n*One who embodies true virtue and understands all things*—\nas in the *Zhuangzi*’s *□Dianzi Fang* chapter:\nDianzi, whose name means \"Unselective,\" attended upon Wei Wenhou.\nWenhou studied with Zixia and befriended Dianzi.\nDianzi often praised the Dao/Way of the *Xigong*,\nand Wenhou took the *Xigong* as Dianzi’s teacher.\nDianzi said:\n*\"No, the *Xigong* is merely a neighbor from my village.\nI frequently speak of the Dao/Way correctly,\nso the *Xigong* praises me.\nMy true teacher is Dongguo Shunzi.\nHe is a man of true virtue—\nhis outward form reflects humanity,\nyet his inner nature aligns with the Dao/Way,\npreserving purity and clarity while embracing all things.\nThings lack no Dao/Way when he appears,\nfor his bearing awakens understanding in others,\ndissolving all false intentions.\nHow could I, Unselective, ever compare to him?\nThis is when things lose their Dao/Way,\nand Dongguo Shunzi corrects his bearing,\nhis heart merging with the Way,\nwhile things behold him and naturally awaken—\nfalse desires utterly vanish.\n*This may truly be called*\n*the Dao/Way that acts without words,\nand transforms without exertion.*\n*How profound the true Dao/Way is!*\n\n**On skillful action:**\nThis clarifies following natural tendencies and adapting to circumstances,\nas the method of flexible, responsive, and harmonious conduct.\n\nWater conforms to square or round vessels,\nand its flow adjusts to blockages or releases—\nthus it can traverse seas and float beneath the heavens,\n*expansive and vast.*\nA ruler governs by natural order,\ndelegating tasks to the worthy,\nusing them without doubt,\neach fulfilling their role—\n*then governance requires no effort,*\nand peace prevails in all things.\n\n**On timely action:**\nThis clarifies rising and retreating according to the times,\nas the precept to uphold the Dao/Way and preserve life.\n\n*Pan*—to disperse—\nspring spreads the warmth of yang,\nlayered ice melts and disperses,\nwinter brings cold and harshness,\nyet flowing waters solidify and freeze—\n*water follows the seasons.*\n\nThe Way of governing the state,\nthe method of cultivating oneself,\nexpands or contracts with the times,\nfollowing the nature of things—\n*then one attains the utmost principle,*\n*then one preserves life.*\n\n**On the virtue of non-contention:**\nOnly by not contending does one avoid blame.\nThe virtue of non-contention is the foremost virtue.\nHuman nature cannot avoid contention,\nyet those who contend are many:\n*obstinate defiance contends,*\n*violence and arrogance contend,*\n*anger and rage contend,*\n*excess and waste contend,*\n*boastfulness and self-aggrandizement contend,*\n*love of victory and rivalry contend,*\n*disturbance and obstruction contend,*\n*greed and ambition contend,*\n*courage and cowardice contend,*\n*love and hatred contend,*\n*selfishness and tyranny contend,*\n*favoritism and partiality contend.*\n\nIf a king harbors even one of these,\n*he will raise armies throughout the land.*\nIf a feudal lord harbors even one of these,\n*their states will clash in war.*\n\n**On the Virtue of Non-Contention in the Common and the Lowly:**\n\nIf a high official harbors even one of these [vices],\n*he will bring ruin to his household.*\nIf a commoner harbors even one of these,\n*harm will arise within himself.*\n\nAll such contention stems from\n*lack of thought and reflection,*\n*transgressing rites and laws,*\n*without fear or reverence,*\n*without tolerance or forbearance—*\n*thus contention arises.*\n\nTherefore, those who contend over cities\n*fill the city with slaughtered men,*\nand those who contend over land\n*fill the fields with slaughtered men.*\nOne must examine the roots of contention,\n*block its source,*\n*and then all will be in harmony.*\n\nThe saying goes:\n*The virtuous person contends not.*\nAgain it is said:\n*In ugliness, one does not contend.*\nThe lower scriptures say:\n*The Dao of the Sage is to act without contending.*\nWhat fault could there be in the virtue of non-contention?\n\n**The Four Virtues of the Highest Good:**\n\n*The Empty-Hearted*—\n*the empty-hearted have no desires.*\n*The Flexibly Whole*—\n*the flexibly whole bend themselves to preserve others.*\n*The Flowing Wave*—\n*the flowing wave follows nature’s ease,*\n*the decadent and slack—*\n*the decadent and slack abandon restraint without hindrance.*\n\n*The Flowing Wave*—\nAs *Zhuangzi* says in *\"The Response of the Emperor\"*:\n*\"Transformation and decay flow like the tides,*\n*the affairs of the world surge like waves—*\n*nothing remains unchanged.\"*\n\n*The Yielding-Compliant*—\n*the yielding-compliant surrender their heart to the Way.*\n\n**The Three Abilities:**\nTo embody these four virtues,\nto follow these three abilities—\n*this is the key to national peace and longevity.*\n\nAs *Dao Jun of Song* said:\n*The highest good is like water.*\n\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*\"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao,*\n*and what follows it is called virtue.\"*\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"To separate virtue from the Dao.\"*\n\nOnce virtue is named,\n*the essence of the Dao is diminished.*\nYet heaven generates water from the One,\n*not yet far from the Dao.*\nDeep and void, still and clear—\n*this is called the utmost refinement in the world.*\n\nThus, the highest good is like water.\nWater is supremely beneficial,\n*nearly approaching the Dao.*\n\nIt condenses into rain and dew,\n*nourishing all things;*\nit freezes into frost and snow,\n*forming all treasures;*\nit flows as rivers and lakes,\n*gathering in pools and marshes.*\nDeep springs and vast seas\n*draw and store,*\n*enriching life and growth—*\n*all things rely on it without depletion.*\nIn benefiting others,\n*what is more excellent than this?*\n\nBenefiting all things,\n*all things receive its grace,*\n*its bestowal,*\n*yet it remains in the humble, weak, non-contending place.*\nIt absorbs filth and dirt,\n*without burdening itself with self-regard,*\n*thus it is close to the Dao.*\n\n*Ji*—near.\n\n**The Six Virtues of Water:**\n\n*Residing in the good place.*\nFlowing through the earth,\n*it fills without overflowing.*\n*The good heart is deep.*\n*The deeper it is measured,*\n*the deeper it becomes;*\n*the further it is explored,*\n*the more distant it grows.*\n*The good is kind.*\n*It loves all without partiality,*\n*gives without choosing.*\n*The good word is trustworthy.*\n*Avoiding obstacles, it reaches the seas;*\n*traversing dangers, it never loses its truth.*\n*The good governance is orderly.*\n*It purifies the impure,*\n*levels the steep,*\n*follows nature effortlessly,*\n*without scheming in its heart—*\n*thus all is governed.*\n*The good skill is adaptable.*\n*It bends to the land’s curves and straightness,*\n*to the vessel’s roundness and angles;*\n*it adapts to constant change*\n*yet remains ever balanced.*\n*The good action is timely.*\n*When released, it flows east;*\n*when directed, it flows west—*\n*it moves without constraint,*\n*proper only in its season.*\n\nOnly by not contending\n*does one avoid blame.*\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao,\n*thus preserving the body for enduring life,*\n*and benefiting others*\n*while dwelling in the non-contending place.*\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Is it easy to have and yet do nothing with it?\"*\n*It is easy to do nothing and commit few faults,*\n*but difficult to act and yet have no regrets.*\n*Once one benefits others through action,*\n*to remain blameless becomes difficult.*\n\nThe highest good benefits others like water’s nature—\n*it benefits without choosing what to benefit,*\n*it does not contend with others,*\n*and thus none can contend with it,*\n*hence no blame arises.*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Under heaven, nothing is as soft and weak as water,*\n*yet in attacking the hard and strong,*\n*nothing can surpass it.\"*\n\n*Wang Anshi* said:\n*The highest good is like water.*\n*What is called \"good\" can follow the Dao,*\n*yet it cannot exhaust the Dao—*\n*thus the person of highest good is like water.*\n\nWater’s nature is to benefit all things,\n*all things rely on water to live,*\n*yet water’s nature is supremely soft and weak—*\n*thus it does not contend.*\n\nPeople prefer the high and despise the low,\n*yet water dwells where people despise.*\n\n**Residing in the good place—**\n*The good place is low.*\n**The good heart is deep—**\n*Deep is still.*\n**The good is kind—**\n*It gives without seeking return.*\n**The good word is trustworthy—**\n*Even if bent a thousand times, it flows east.*\n**The good governance is orderly—**\n*The most yielding overcomes the world’s hardness.*\n**The good skill is adaptable—**\n*If square, it becomes square; if round, it becomes round.*\n**The good action is timely—**\n*In spring it rises; in winter it freezes.*\n\nAs *Su Yingbin* said:\n*The highest good is like water,*\n*thus nearly approaching the Dao.*\n\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*\"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao,*\n*and what follows it is called virtue,*\n*what fulfills it is called nature.\"*\n*Again it says:*\n*\"Heaven generates water from the One.\"*\n*Just as the Dao moves to become virtue,*\n*so too does qi move to generate water.*\nThus it is said:\n*The highest good is like water.*\n\nBoth arise from the formless and take form—\n*their principles are the same.*\nThe Dao is everywhere, benefiting all,\n*and so too is water.*\n\nYet once they have taken form,\n*they diverge from the Dao.*\nThus it is said:\n*\"Nearly approaching the Dao.\"*\n\nYet nothing can be named as good\n*as this—*\n*thus it is called the highest good.*\n\n**From Residing in the Good Place to Acting in Due Time:**\n\n*Avoiding the high, seeking the low,*\n*never opposing—*\n*this is the good place;*\n*Empty, still, silent, unfathomable—*\n*this is the good depth;*\n*Benefiting all things,*\n*giving without seeking return—*\n*this is the good kindness;*\n*Round, it turns; square, it bends;*\n*blocked, it stops; released, it flows—*\n*this is the good trustworthiness;*\n*Purifying all filth,*\n*leveling high and low—*\n*this is the good governance;*\n*Encountering things, it takes their form,*\n*yet does not cling to one—*\n*this is the good skill;*\n*In winter it freezes, in spring it thaws,*\n*in drought it recedes, in flood it swells—*\n*this is the good timing.*\n\nOnly by not contending\n*does one avoid blame.*\n\nEven if one has virtue,\n*they are not free from human censure—*\n*for they contend.*\n\n**The Virtue of Water: The Supreme Good**\n\nWater alone does not contend,\nand thus it encompasses the seven virtues without blame.\n\n**Lǚ Jìfǔ said:**\n*The Supreme Good is like water.*\n\nThe interplay of yin and yang—this is the Dao.\nWhat follows is virtue.\n\nTo call it \"following\" is already to depart from the Dao,\nand thus it is no longer the body of the Dao itself.\nThe Supreme Good is the Dao’s own virtue.\n\nNot all under heaven know virtue as virtue,\nand so it is like water.\n\nWater’s virtue is in its utility—\nit nearly attains the Dao.\n\nFor water benefits all things without contending,\ndwelling where others abhor.\n\nAnd so the Supreme Good does likewise—\nyet this is still not the Dao itself,\nbut nearly so.\n\n**Residing in the Good Place.**\nThe rivers and seas rule over all valleys\nbecause they are low.\nThus, to dwell is to be in the Good Place.\n\n**The Heart as the Good Depth.**\nThe stillness of stagnant water is a depth,\nthe flow of moving water is a depth,\nand the discernment of the *guīhuáng* is a depth.\nThus, the heart is the Good Depth.\n\n**Giving is Good Kindness, Speech is Good Trustworthiness.**\nIt overflows without filling,\nit pours without exhausting—\nthus, to give is Good Kindness.\n\nIt ventures upon dangers without failing in trust—\nthus, speech is Good Trustworthiness.\n\n**Governance is Good Governance.**\nIts branches become rivers and valleys,\nits gathering becomes the seas—\nsufficient for governance, it is Good Governance.\n\n**Action is Good Skill.**\nGood governance: nothing is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the firm and strong.\nThus, in action, it is Good Skill.\n\n**Movement is Good Timing.**\nSources gush ceaselessly, day and night,\nfilling the basin before advancing.\nOnly by not contending\ndoes one avoid blame.\n\nIn essence, to emerge without contending\nand to take dwelling as foundation—\nthus it is said:\n*Only by not contending*\n*does one take first place under heaven.*\n\n**Wáng Yuànzé said:**\n*The Supreme Good is like water.*\nWater is the first of the Five Phases,\nemerging from emptiness into substance.\nNot far from the Dao, its nature is closest to it.\n\nFor when one departs from the Dao, virtue is established,\nand the Supreme Good is like water—\na natural principle of things.\n\nWater’s virtue is in its utility—\nit nearly attains the Dao.\n\nHumans have two hearts—fire—\nfire ascends and shines,\nand thus they love to contend.\nOnly when the will aligns with the Dao\ncan one transcend things without the heart overcoming them.\n\n**Residing in the Good Place.**\nDescending and flowing.\n\n**The Heart as the Good Depth.**\nDeep, still, and level—\ninternally bright, externally obscured.\n\n**Governance is Good Governance.**\nFollowing nature rather than emotion,\naccumulating softness to bear great weight.\n\n**Action is Good Skill.**\nAdapting to change—\nthus, nothing is beyond its ability.\n\n**Movement is Good Timing.**\nIf obstructed, it stops;\nif released, it flows.\nIt does not move before things,\nyet it does not lose its timing.\n\nOnly by not contending\ndoes one avoid blame.\n\nWater’s unity is unassailable by things,\nand thus it encompasses these virtues.\n\nFor it has virtue toward things\nwhile always descending before them—\nthis is why it has virtue.\n\nIf one were to willfully seek virtue,\nthey could not fulfill it.\n\nThus, the text concludes by reiterating this.\n\n**Liú Shēnpíng said:**\n*The Supreme Good is like water.*\nEmerging from non-being into being,\ndwelling in what is despised without contending,\nyet benefiting things—\nwater’s use here is nearest to the Supreme Good.\n\nWhen the heart embodies this, its name is established,\nand so it is said to be *like* water.\n\n**Giving is Good Kindness, Governance is Good Governance.**\nYet water itself has no governance—\nwhy then speak of trustworthiness and governance?\n\nBecause in discussing the virtuous person as water,\nwe extend governance to the virtuous person as well.\n\n**Movement is Good Timing.**\nVirtue inheres in water,\nand exhausts itself in my own goodness.\n\nGoodness is goodness—\nthus, to dwell is to rest in the Good Place,\nthe heart to abide in the Good Depth,\ngiving to balance Good Kindness,\nspeech to uphold Good Trustworthiness,\naction to deploy Good Skill,\nmovement to follow Good Timing.\n\nFrom *Záshuō*:\n*Movement is Good Timing*—\nfor it moves in accordance with time,\nand this is the goodness of movement.\n\nThe *Shū* also says:\n*\"Consider well before acting,\nand act only in its proper time.\"*\n\nThe *Shī* praises Nán Zhòng’s thin assault on the Western Róng,\nyet speaks of the chirping grass insects and the leaping *fúzhōng*—\nfor their movement follows its response.\n\nIf one does not move in accordance with time,\nhow could one attain this?\n\n**Liú Jùjì said:**\n*The Supreme Good is like water.*\n\nThe *Yì* says: *\"What follows the Dao is virtue.\"*\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *\"To depart from the Dao is to establish virtue.\"*\nBoth mean that from the Dao downward,\nnone are closer to virtue than this.\n\nVirtue without its own virtue—\nthis is the Supreme Good,\nlike the Supreme Virtue’s goodness.\n\nWater’s virtue is in its utility—\nit nearly attains the Dao.\n\nThe Dao generates Oneness,\nOneness generates Water—\nthus, water is near the Dao.\n\nWater’s virtue is in its moistening—\nthis is called *utility*.\nGood timing is called *not contending*.\nDescending is called *dwelling in what is despised*.\n\nTo benefit others without boasting\nis like water’s utility without contending.\n\nTo place oneself below others\nis like water dwelling where others abhor.\n\nThe Dao also benefits all things without contending,\ndwelling where others abhor—\nand water is like this.\n\nIf water is like the Dao,\nthen the Supreme Good is like water.\n\nThis is why it is near the Dao.\n\n**Residing in the Good Place.**\nVirtue takes dwelling in lowliness as its place,\nwater takes descending as its place—\nin virtue, it attains water’s place,\nand so it is said: *Residing in the Good Place.*\n\n**The Heart as the Good Depth.**\nVirtue takes stillness as its heart,\nwater takes depth and stillness as its depth—\nin virtue, it attains water’s depth,\nand so it is said: *The Heart as the Good Depth.*\n\n**Giving is Good Kindness, Speech is Good Trustworthiness.**\nVirtue takes teaching others as giving,\nwater takes benefiting things as kindness—\nin virtue, it attains water’s kindness,\nand so it is said: *Giving is Good Kindness.*\n\nVirtue takes honesty as speech,\nwater takes venturing upon dangers without failing in trust—\nin water, it attains water’s trustworthiness,\nand so it is said: *Speech is Good Trustworthiness.*\n\n**Governance is Good Governance.**\nVirtue takes rectifying oneself and others as governance,\nwater takes stirring and separating the pure and turbid as governance—\nin virtue, it attains water’s governance,\nand so it is said: *Governance is Good Governance.*\n\n**Action is Good Skill.**\nVirtue takes harmony as action,\nwater takes rounding and squaring without obstruction as skill—\nin virtue, it attains water’s skill,\nand so it is said: *Action is Good Skill.*\n\n**Movement is Good Timing.**\nWater takes winter congealing and spring thawing as timing,\nin virtue attains water’s timing,\nand so it is said: *Movement is Good Timing.*\n\nOnly the non-contending is without blame.\nIt is said that the highest virtue should be like water,\nfor non-contending is the highest virtue.\n\nTo make non-contending advantageous,\none can thus embrace these seven virtues\nand be aided by Heaven and assisted by humankind.\nWhat fault could there be?\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of the Sage’s matters beyond the body,\nand since the six virtues do not contend,\nthey are followed by the six virtues.\n\nLiu Ji said: *\"The highest virtue is like water, hence without blame.\"*\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Those who follow the Way are virtuous.\"*\n*Zhuangzi* also says: *\"To depart from the Way is to be virtuous.\"*\nAll say that from the Dao downward, none approach virtue as closely.\n\nHeaven’s One generates water,\nyet it is not far from the Way,\nso the highest virtue is like water.\n\nWater’s virtue benefits all things—\nthough supremely yielding and weak,\nit does not contend.\nIt dwells where people dislike,\nthus nearly attaining the Way.\n\nThose who dwell in good land\nplace themselves beneath others.\nThose whose hearts are virtuous depths\nare clear through stillness.\nThose who give with virtue are benevolent,\nbenefiting others without seeking return.\nThose whose speech is virtuous are trustworthy,\nventuring upon dangers without failing in trust.\n\nNext, it flows; when contained, it stops—\nvirtue’s governance is good governance.\nFilling basins and advancing,\na thousand turns yet it flows east—\nvirtue’s skill is good skill.\nSource springs, ceaseless day and night—\nmovement is good timing.\n\nEmbracing these seven virtues without contending with things,\nthere is no blame.\nThis is how it nearly attains the Way.\n\nOnly the Way gathers in emptiness while water flows downward,\nnaturally without the burden of excess,\nso it is followed by *\"Hold and it will be full.\"*\n\nZhao Shizhen said: *\"First, the analogy of two things: one, yielding succession to the Way.\nThe highest virtue is like water—\nas the previous chapter says, it is not without private intent,\nyet it accomplishes its private intent.\nIt clarifies how Heaven, Earth, and the Sage\nachieve public good through private means.\nHe who can achieve public good through private means\ntruly understands the mechanisms of Heaven and humankind,\nand goes nowhere without fitting in.\nThis is the highest virtue.\nThus it is said: *The highest virtue is like water.*\n\nFor benevolence is the root of virtue,\nrighteousness is its foundation,\nrites are its adornment,\ntrust is its depth,\nwisdom is its refinement.\nEach has its virtue, yet none exhausts virtue.\nOnly water’s virtue encompasses all seven,\nso it is called the highest virtue.\nVirtue is all-encompassing.\nAll-encompassing means fully prepared—\nthis is why it is the highest virtue.\nThus, *the highest virtue is like water.*\n\nThe commentary cites *Zhuangzi*: *\"To depart from the Way is to be virtuous.\"*\nWhen virtue is named, the body of the Way is diminished,\nyet Heaven’s One generates water,\nand departing from the Way is not far.\nThis again reveals the meaning of the highest virtue.\n\n**Two, directly pointing to water’s virtue.**\nWater’s virtue benefits all—\nthus it nearly attains the Way.\nPreviously, virtue was compared to water;\nnow water’s virtue is spoken of directly.\n\nThe Five Phases: Metal generates Water.\nWhere Metal is generated, Water inherits its form and precedes it,\nthus not departing from its mother.\nYet Water is born from *Kan* (the abyss),\n*Kan* resides in the *zi* position,\nthe Yellow Palace nurtures its qi—\nthis is its proper place.\nThe lands it encompasses\nare where the divine response resides within.\n*The Hongfan* says: Heaven’s One generates Water,\nEarth’s Two generates Fire,\nFire is born from Water’s essence—*jingyi*.\nThe divine is in the essence,\nthe divine response follows as the second,\nthree Yangs are born from Water,\nWater descends while Wind ascends.\nThree Yins are born from Wind,\nWind ascends while Water descends.\nYin and Yang merge in virtue,\ndivine responses interact and apply—\nthough one Yin and one Yang,\none Wind and one Water,\ntheir origin is Heaven’s One as the root,\nso Water rises as vapor to become clouds,\nclouds transform into rain,\nall things thrive from Water and are born.\nWater’s benefit is for all under Heaven,\nthus it is said: *Water’s virtue benefits all things,*\nand it does not contend.\nAgain, one phrase cannot exhaust its virtue,\nso it is restated.\n\nNon-contending is Water’s yielding nature.\nYielding is顺 (*shùn*),顺 is not opposing things,\nthus it communicates with all.\n*Mencius* says: *\"Direct it east, it flows east;\ndirect it west, it flows west.\nDraw it, and it reaches—*\nall this is the work of yielding.\nYet Water’s nature is to descend,\nwhile human inclination favors ascent.\nThose who favor ascent dislike descent,\nand disliking descent is the common inclination.\nDescending is to dwell in lowliness—\nlowliness is the virtue of the highest.\nHe who cannot dwell in lowliness will contend,\ncontending means to precede others,\npreceding others means he cannot transcend his body.\nTranscending the body means he can be humble and modest—\nthis aligns with what was said before.\nThus it is said: *It dwells where people dislike,*\nhence it nearly attains the Way.\n*Near* means *close*.\nThe commentary says: *The Yijing* says: *\"One Yin, one Yang—this is the Way;\nthose who follow it are virtuous.\"*\nThus it is known that none approach the Way as closely as virtue.\nYet the Way is vast, seeming unworthy,\nand the world dares not submit to it—\nsubtle, beyond grasp,\nno thing can compare.\nOnly Water’s lowliness\ncan nearly approach it.\n\nNext, the seven virtues are elaborated:\n\n**One, the virtue of harmonizing.**\nDwelling in good land—\nWater and Earth together encompass,\nyet when divided, Earth is still while Water moves.\nEarth’s nature restrains Water,\nbut when Water overflows, Earth builds dikes.\nEarth cultivates grains,\nWater irrigates—\nthus Earth succeeds through Water.\nInitially, they share one breath—\nbrothers.\nAfter division, they are husband and wife.\nIf not restrained, the six would not generate,\nand harmony would not produce creation.\nThus Water moves upon the land—\nWater’s benefit lies in the land.\nLand is lowliness,\nWater is descent.\nWater and Earth share virtue,\nand cannot be separated for an instant—\nthis is why they harmonize virtues.\nHarmonizing virtues returns to their origin.\nUnlike the Way,\nthey do not differ and do not conspire against each other.\nThus, level land levels Water and Earth,\nand it is known that Water dwells in good land.\n\n**御注曰:**\nDwelling upon the land, it flows in the center yet never overflows.\n**Two,** its essence is clarity and stillness—\nits heart is profoundly serene.\n\nThose with nature possess a heart;\nthose without feeling lack a heart—\nWater has no feeling,\nso how could it have a heart?\nThe *Classic* speaks of a heart\nonly by analogy to human mind in Water.\n\nThe heart is the **Dao/Way**.\nThe **Dao/Way** arises from the heart;\nwhen the heart is still, all forms perish—\nthus its depths are boundless,\nunseen and unfathomable.\nYet when the heart stirs and spirit awakens,\nthe **Dao/Way** scatters as things—\nhow could it fully manifest its use?\n\n\"Serene\" means deep—\nalso \"serene\" means void.\nThe heart’s emptiness holds the principle of profound stillness,\nso the deeper it is measured,\nthe farther it extends.\nZhuangzi said: *\"Serene and still.\"*\nDoes this not illuminate Water’s heart?\n\nWhen unmoved, it is clear;\nwhen undisturbed, it is level—\nhere, even eyebrows and mustaches are revealed.\nThe heavy and turbid settle below,\nthe pure and bright rise above—\nall things rest here.\nThese are the meanings of profound stillness.\n\n**Three,** its virtue is to nurture life—\nits excellence is benevolence.\nThose with hearts give without favor;\nthose without hearts distribute evenly—\nWater’s impartiality\nreaches the utmost benevolence.\nWater makes no choice,\nyet virtue flows universally.\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Kàn has sincerity—its heart is flourishing.\"*\nWith one *yang* dwelling between two *yin*,\nif one cannot cultivate virtue and refine conduct\nto depart from peril,\nhow could one show unceasing sincerity?\nWhen in Kàn, one *yang* returns—\nreturning to reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth’s heart originates in nurturing life;\nreturning, it ceases.\nReturning and ceasing,\nit turns toward life.\nThe heart of universal love is the sage’s mind.\nWithout embodying the **Dao/Way**,\nbenevolence remains constrained—\nlike a drought’s meager dew,\nhow could it compare to Heaven’s timely rains?\nThus, even Yao and Shun found it laborious\nto broadly bestow and aid the people.\nYet Water’s transformation,\nsharing virtue with the **Dao/Way**,\nis universally loving, impartial,\nand gives without choice—\nwhat could it not encompass?\nThus it is said: *\"Its excellence is benevolence.\"*\n\n**Four,** it has a central master—\nspeaking of faithfulness.\nRoots and stems are the origin of things;\nnature and life are what the **Dao/Way** generates.\nTracing its source,\nfollowing its inherent nature,\nit does not deviate from principle.\nThe Five Phases attribute wisdom to Water,\nfaithfulness to Earth.\nHow does Water speak of faithfulness?\nObserve *Fù*—seven days return,\n*qi* transmits to *Zhōngfú* (faithfulness).\nKàn in *Fù* obtains *Zhōngfú* naturally—\nthis is why it is said to master faithfulness.\nThe *Tai Xuan* states:\nOne *yang* rides upon unity,\nall things draw form from the center—\nWater embodies *Zhōngfú*,\nthe central *yang qi* subtly illuminates the Yellow Palace—\nfaithfulness is never absent from the center.\nTruly, the primal spirit’s subtlety lies in one *qi*,\nthe origin of myriad threads begins with wisdom—\nthe source of faithfulness obtains wisdom,\nunifying speech and wisdom, action and faithfulness,\nwithout losing harmony with things.\nWisdom does not inherently master faithfulness—\nin affairs, hesitation breeds regret;\nfaithfulness is not wisdom in action—\nin nature, it stagnates and falters.\nThus, the essence resides within,\nmanifestation lies without—\nultimate speech transcends speech,\ngreat faithfulness requires no oaths,\nso beginning and end are trustworthy,\nnot hollow and empty,\nyet vast in reception.\nThus, it is known:\nIf one speaks without faithfulness in action,\none loses its root.\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Moving through peril without losing faithfulness\"—\nthis is the reason.\n\n**Five,** it follows principle in action—\ngovernance excels in order.\nThe Great **Dao/Way** takes rationality as master;\ngovernance precedes literature.\nSince Heaven and Earth came to be,\nno ruler over all things\nhas failed to exhaust principle and nature\nyet still transformed the people.\nThe Three Sovereigns governed through spiritual transformation of the **Dao/Way**,\nthe Five Emperors ruled with benevolence aligned with Heaven—\nand the world spoke of governance.\nYet who knows its root is as yielding as Water,\nencountering nothing yet achieving transformation?\nThose who arrogantly establish their own virtue\nand disrupt the Great Constant\nsimply do not know the foundation of governance—\nhow could they avoid hardship and scarcity?\nWater’s nature seeks lowliness and moisture,\nflows through the earth,\nbends a thousand times yet flows east,\navoids obstacles and reaches the sea—\nthis is Water’s principle.\nGovernance’s foundation in human nature\nis like irrigation and cultivation—\nmovement and growth depend on it for life;\nlike rain and dew,\nwithering things rely on it for nourishment—\nthis is Water’s function.\nGovernance’s origin in sustaining life\nis like cleansing filth and replacing it with purity,\nreceiving all impurities and replacing them with clarity—\nthis is Water’s virtue.\nGovernance’s excellence in guiding customs\nis like dikes that can be extended,\nyet rivers cannot be violated,\nbarriers that can be built,\nyet torrents cannot be resisted—\nthis is Water’s power.\nGovernance conquers the world with yielding **Dao/Way**,\nlike springs flowing ceaselessly,\ntheir currents vast and boundless—\nthe more drawn, the clearer,\nthe more issued, the fresher—\nthis is Water’s root.\nGovernance renews the world daily,\nlike Water’s inherent qualities—\nall these it possesses,\nthus its excellence in governance is clear.\nAh!\nNothing but Water.\nWaves surge yet are not evil,\nstillness is profound yet not beautiful—\nthough turbulent, it never loses its goodness;\npurified, it is not stagnant;\nstirred, it is not reckless;\nraging, it never loses its longevity.\nThe Supreme Good says: *\"The highest excellence is like Water.\"*\nThe sage embodies this for governance—\nis this not universal wisdom?\n\n**Six,** it adapts to the vessel’s round or square—\naffairs excel in capability.\nEffortless action yields few errors;\naction with purpose yields no calamity is difficult.\nUnder Heaven, no affair remains still and unmoving.\nWhen it moves,\nresponding to make it appropriate—\nnone but the wise and insightful\ncan decisively judge it.\n\n**Water’s Nature—**\nFrom Heaven’s single source it issues forth,\na ceaseless trickle,\nuntil it fills the basin and then advances,\nspreading across the Four Seas.\nObserve it in the Two Yin*—\nit can navigate peril;\none Yang* abides at its center—\nits spirit flows freely.\nThough it rests in Yin,\nthough it sinks into danger,\nit never strays from peril—\nflowing yet never full,\ndwelling yet emerging,\nits applications are vast.\n\nYet it never contends with things,\nadapting to the land’s curves and straights—\nnot crooked for its own sake,\nnor rigid without restraint.\nIt conforms to the vessel’s shape—\nsquare without rigidity,\nround without fixed form.\nIt responds to the myriad transformations of things\nyet never loses its constancy;\nit fits the timing of use\nyet never falters in sincerity—\ntruly, it has no power\nyet lacks no capability.\n\nThe Supreme Good’s work\nis most evident here.\n\n**Seven,** its flow and congealing have constancy.\nIts movement is timely.\nUnder Heaven’s affairs,\nthe virtuous observe them for advance and retreat,\nlying in the interplay of emergence and withdrawal.\n\nEmerging at its proper time,\nthe sage acts and all things witness;\nretiring by the Dao/Way,\nthe hidden dragon* yields to the wind* and frets in obscurity.\nWhen one should emerge yet withdraws,\nrolling up like a scroll—\nthis is the way of the unvirtuous.\nWhen one should retire yet emerges,\nforcing action—\nthis is the way of the unwise.\n\nKnowing the Dao/Way of advance and retreat,\nnever losing its proper time,\nthen movement is auspicious.\n\n*The *Book of Documents* says:\n*\"Consider well and act,\nact only when the time is ripe.\"*\n\nAs for Water’s movement—\nwhen Yang releases it, it floats;\nwhen Yin congeals it, it becomes ice.\nWithin one body, it holds Yang within and Yin without;\nin spring and winter, it has motion and stillness.\nThus, those who move with adaptability\nrespond to the *Yù* timing*—auspicious;\nthose who move with clarity\nrespond to the *Fēng* timing*—auspicious;\nthose who move with daring\nrespond to the *Jiě* timing*—auspicious;\nthose who move with strength\nrespond to the *Dàzhuàng* timing*—auspicious.\n\nThe ancients hid their talents within,\nawaiting the proper time;\nadvanced their virtue and cultivated their affairs,\nseeking to grasp the moment;\nrefined their conduct and guarded their actions,\nwaiting for the right season;\nunderstood the fitting approach,\ndesiring to settle in harmony;\nwithdrew into obscurity and rested in seclusion,\nfollowing the times.\n\nBy the times’ unfolding,\neven Heaven does not resist—\nas for those skilled in nurturing life,\nthey press forward and then respond;\nthose who master the art of interaction,\nadvance and retreat at the proper moments.\n\nIf one dwells in the world yet knows not emergence and withdrawal,\npursues the True yet fails to recognize floating and sinking—\nhow then can one attain the meaning of timely action?\n\n**Later, congealing forms two principles:**\n**One,** the summation of yielding and adaptability.\nTruly, non-contention is Water’s nature;\ninherent in gentleness and weakness is Water’s virtue/power.\nIn non-contention’s excellence,\nthe advantage of non-contention is seen in the Seven Affairs.\nIn governing one’s self,\nit does not use strength to conquer others.\nIn dwelling within one’s self,\nit fits just what is needed to guard with gentleness—\nif it can be assailed,\nif it can be scorned,\nthen those who endure slander are drowned,\nthose who endure impurity are sullied.\nYet the patient endure scorn,\nthe clear grow slowly from turbid—\nnone can ultimately overcome its gentleness.\n\nCan Water’s force, descending to the low,\nbecome what all people despise?\nYet it never knows to dwell low while serving high?\nCan Water’s nature, gentle and weak,\nbe overcome by the strong?\nYet it never knows to gather in gentleness\nand use it—then it becomes strong.\n\nWhen it is nurtured,\nit flows as a trickle,\nyet when it surges,\nnone can restrain its non-contention—\nthe Dao/Way few can wield it.\n\n**Two,** without the breath of human Dao/Way,\nthere is no blame.\nThe strong oppress the weak,\nthe many bully the few—\nall take upon themselves the fault of their strength.\nYet the gentle Dao/Way moves with harmony,\nand none find fault in it.\n\nAs *Shào Ruò* said:\n*\"The Supreme Good is like Water—\nthus there is no blame.\"*\n\nAll people love contention,\nyet Laozi sets non-contention as the Supreme Good,\nusing Water as an analogy—\nWater has no desire of its own,\nyet benefits all things without contention,\ndwelling where all people despise it.\n\nBy Water’s virtue/power,\nit nearly attains the Dao/Way.\nIf one acts without desire,\nthen non-contention is auspicious;\ndwelling without desire,\nthen stillness is auspicious;\nwith others without desire,\nthen benevolence is auspicious;\nspeaking without desire,\nthen sincerity is auspicious;\ngoverning without desire,\nthen administration is auspicious;\ndoing without desire,\nthen capability is auspicious;\nmoving without desire,\nthen timing is auspicious.\n\nTruly, without desire,\nnon-contention is auspicious—\nthus there is no blame.\n\nAs *Wáng Zhìrán* said:\n*\"The Supreme Good is like Water—\nthus there is no blame.\"*\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Principles*,\nthe Two Principles generate the Four Symbols*,\nthe Four Symbols generate the Five Phases*,\nand the Five Phases’ transformations are vast.\n\nIn Heaven, they become the Five Stars*;\non Earth, they become the Five Mountains*;\nin humans, they are called the Five Constants*;\nin the body, they are the Five Viscera*.\nApplied to colors, they are the Five Hues*;\napplied to music, they are the Five Tones*;\nthe tongue savors them as the Five Flavors*;\nthe nose perceives them as the Five Fragrances*—\neach reaching its full use,\ncalled the Five Talents*.\n\nMutually generating and mutually restraining,\nalternately waxing and waning,\nyet benefiting all things without contention,\ndwelling where all people despise it without refusal—\nits functions are beyond naming,\nthus those who nearly attain the Dao/Way,\nonly Water can do so.\n\nWhy?\nWater’s nature can be both gentle and strong,\nboth round and square,\nboth crooked and straight,\nboth short and long—\nmelting into rivers,\ncongealing into ice,\ngathering as seas,\ndispersing as clouds.\nAll myriad things draw from it to live,\nall treasures obtain it to form.\nIts source is boundless,\nits flow ceaseless—\nHeaven’s first creation,\nnot far from the Dao/Way.\n\nHaving marked the name of the Supreme Good,\nwhich of all myriad things is better than this?\nThus it is said: *\"Under Heaven, none are gentler and weaker than Water,\nyet none are better at overcoming the firm and strong.\"*\nIts non-contention and victory are such—\nas for its flowing, dispersing, and shifting,\nit chooses no place yet finds rest;\nin the level, it measures and applies;\nit receives filth and absorbs stains,\nfull yet never overflowing—\nthis is what is called *\"dwelling in auspicious places.\"*\n\nThe Sage who dwells in stillness\nmarks no reflection in flowing waters,\nyet mirrors all in stillness—\nstillness, then clarity,\nreturning to the origin, pure and true.\nNone can surpass the Supreme Void—\nthis is called *\"the heart’s deep virtue.\"*\n\nTo love universally without favor,\nto know all yet never exhaust—\nto take virtue as kindness,\nis it not to make oneself small?\nThis is called *\"the benevolent in harmony.\"*\n\nStraight speech, though reversed,\nis plain as water, tasteless yet profound.\nUnsummoned, it gathers;\nuninvited, it arrives—\nthis is called *\"speech’s true faith.\"*\n\nTo curb the excesses of Zeng and Shi,\nto silence Yang and Mo’s mouths—\nif all hold such wisdom, Heaven’s confusion ceases;\nif all embody such virtue, Heaven’s misguidance ends.\nThis is called *\"governance’s perfect order.\"*\n\nAbandon the wise, discard cleverness—\ngreat thieves then desist.\nAbandon artifice, discard profit—\nthe people’s gain is a hundredfold.\nActing with the times, all undertakings succeed—\nthis is called *\"the adept in action.\"*\n\nSpring’s thaw, winter’s freeze—\nthe seasons’ natural course;\nexploiting terrain for benefit—\nthe way of forces.\nDammed, it stops; released, it flows.\nGuide the people with the times,\nand movement aligns with what is fitting—\nthis is called *\"action’s timely flow.\"*\n\nTo dwell well is to rest in ease,\nto nurture the heart is to dwell in depth and stillness,\nto act benevolently is to give without reserve,\nto speak truly is to stand firm in faith,\nto govern wisely is to bring order and stability,\nto act skillfully is to exhaust one’s capacity,\nto move rightly is to follow the seasons’ lead—\nthis is how the Sage embodies and practices them.\n\nTo govern the world and state,\nin sorrow share the people’s sorrow,\nin joy share the people’s joy.\nTo act without action, few desires—easy;\nto act with action, yet incur no blame—difficult.\nIf one can embody Water’s supreme utility,\nand follow Water’s nature,\nbenefiting myriad ages without knowing how—\nto profit others without contention,\nwhile none can contend with it—\nthen there is no blame.\n\nHuang Maozai said:\n*\"The Supreme Good, like Water, thus incurs no blame.\"*\n\nWater has seven grades of goodness:\nThe highest—\nto benefit others without contention,\nto dwell where others abhor—\nthis is the Supreme Good.\nIf one embodies this, one nears the Dao.\n\nIts lesser grades, sevenfold:\nTo dwell in auspicious places—\nto pool as marshes;\nto nurture a deep heart—\nstillness can reflect;\nto act benevolently—\nits nourishing reach is vast;\nto speak truly—\nits voice, once stirred, never ceases;\nto govern wisely—\nit can cleanse filth and reveal essence;\nto act skillfully—\nit shapes square and round as needed;\nto move with the times—\nfreezing in winter, thawing in spring.\n\nThough these seven may make a good person,\nnone surpass the non-contention of Water—\nnon-contention, thus no blame.\n\nProgram Tai said:\n*\"The Supreme Good, like Water, thus does not contend.\"*\n\nAll things under Heaven that benefit others—\nif I take them alone, another must be deprived,\nand my gain is their loss.\nContention begins here.\n\nWater’s virtue:\nit does not seek to benefit others,\nyet does not refuse to do so.\nIt can boil, irrigate, cleanse, or bear—\nacting only when the time is right,\nso benefit arises without harm elsewhere—\nno contention exists.\n\nThe Supreme Good is the good beyond good.\nTo dwell among the people is to near the Dao.\nBefore movement, it is non-being;\nin its manifestation over all things, it is emptiness.\nWhen it meets events and reveals itself,\nit does not seek fullness,\nbut is moist, weak, lowly, and yielding.\nThough not yet the Dao,\nwhen used with force,\nit does not enter excess—\nthus it attains emptiness and tends toward non-being.\nThis is the closest approach to the Dao.\n\nThough some know the benefit of humility and weakness,\nprivate pride cannot be overcome—\nhow could one willingly bend, endure humiliation,\nand walk the path of humility and weakness?\n\nOnly Water is good at yielding without contention,\nreceiving filth without refusal,\nand in human affairs,\nall that is deemed base or shameful—\nit endures and contains them.\nThough not yet the Dao,\nits inner emptiness and selflessness\nare the essential path for those seeking it.\n\n**Dwelling in auspicious places:**\n*\"Residence\"* refers to where it gathers—\nlow and sunken is its dwelling,\nthus great rivers flow downward—\nhence, *\"auspicious places.\"*\n\n**The heart’s deep virtue:**\nNever ceasing to move yet profoundly still—\nthis is its heart.\n\n**Benevolent harmony:**\nIts nourishment reaches everywhere without limit.\n\n**True speech:**\nIn matters, some should speak yet remain silent,\nsome should be magnified yet are diminished,\nsome should be made plain yet are exaggerated—\nthese are not as they should be.\nWater’s still pools make no sound,\nyet the world calls them *\"profound silence.\"*\nWhen stirred, it makes noise—\ngreat agitation brings great sound,\nsmall agitation brings small sound—\neach encounter is thus—\nthis is called *\"faith.\"*\n\n**Perfect order:**\n*\"Governance\"* corrects what is incorrect.\nOnce cleansed, external filth is gone,\nand the original nature is revealed—\nthis is its order.\n\n**Adept in action:**\nIts balanced levelness, its inner clarity—\nits skill is revealed in action.\n\n**Timely movement:**\nWhen blocked, it stops;\nwhen released, it flows.\nIn cold, it freezes;\nin thaw, it descends—\nit acts as circumstances demand.\n\nOnly because it does not contend\nis there no blame.\nResponding without initiating,\nacting where there is none—\nthough its utility reaches others,\nit does not take from them,\nso none can harm what it does—\nthus the seven goods are not merely Water’s talents.\nSince it does not contend,\nnone blame it,\nand its Supreme Good is easily achieved.\n\n**Discourse on Eighty-One Chapters: Sixfold Elucidation of the Benefits of Non-Contention**\n\nFirst, it is said:\n*\"He who does not vaunt himself has merit,\nHe who does not boast endures long.\nOnly because he does not contend,\nthe world cannot contend with him.\"*\nThis is the first.\n\nSecond:\n*\"To place oneself above others yet serve them,\nTo precede others yet follow them—\nbecause he does not contend,\nthe world cannot contend with him.\"*\nThis is the second.\n\nThird:\n*\"The Way of Heaven acts without contention yet achieves victory.\"*\n\nFourth:\n*\"The Sage’s Way acts without contention.\"*\n\nFifth:\n*\"To wage war without force,\nTo win without claiming victory—\nthis is the virtue of non-contention.\"*\n\nSixth:\n*\"Thus, the sixfold non-contention incurs no blame.\"*\n\nNow, what is called *contention* is not necessarily war or battle.\nWhen two opposing forces refuse to yield—\nthis is contention.\nThough Heaven’s yin and yang are most subtle and ungraspable,\nthey still contend at the winter and summer solstices—\nfor the departing force has not withdrawn,\nwhile the incoming force presses forward.\nThis is called contention.\nThus, contention is when opposing forces arise and neither yields.\n\nBut those who grasp the Dao are otherwise.\nKnowing to embrace the feminine while guarding the masculine,\nthey act yet do not act.\nTheir abilities could benefit others, yet they withhold them;\ntheir wisdom could overshadow the world, yet they conceal it.\nThey never seek to lead the world first—\nhow then could there be contention?\n\nIndeed, Liezi spoke of the Dao of perpetual victory and perpetual defeat:\n*\"The ancients spoke of strength—\nthose who do not yet surpass me,\nwhen they surpass me, are in peril.\nTo surpass me and yet be in peril—\nthis is one who loves victory and must meet his match,\nand thus must surely be defeated.\"*\n\nAgain, he said:\n*\"The gentle one—\nthose who act first perish,\nwhile those who do not contend face no peril.\nThus, their victory is certain.\"*\n\nPushing this logic to its extreme:\nEven if two armies clash and I win,\nit may still be called non-contention.\nI wait in gentleness until the moment of collapse,\nthen strike—\nand this too is non-contention.\nThus is the Dao of perpetual victory.\n\nYet this is perpetual victory from my perspective alone.\nI advance when advantageous,\nand withdraw when not—\nprioritizing self-cultivation over benefiting others.\nThough Laozi’s words are profound,\nhis approach preserves the self at all costs,\nonly acting when peril is absent.\nOtherwise, he refrains.\n\nIndeed, many ancient scholars were like this.\nMorning Gate mocked Confucius:\n*\"Is this not knowing the impossible yet doing it?\"*\nThe man with the basket also said:\n*\"How vulgar! Stubborn and unrecognized—\nthis is enough!\"*\nThese two, though concerned with the world,\nwhen they found none to align with them,\nsimply let things be.\n\nAll such doubts belong to the Daoist path,\nthose unwilling to take action.\n\nBut Confucius was otherwise.\nHearing the basket-man’s words, he sighed:\n*\"Ah, the end is indeed difficult!\"*\nThough loving one’s life while neglecting the world\nwas not beyond Confucius,\nhe prioritized saving the world—\napproaching what must be approached,\nnever shirking what must be done.\nThus, the Five Approaches, the Five Withdrawals,\nand the seventy-two visits—\nall bore the world upon his shoulders.\n\nThough Laozi’s view was not without merit,\nConfucius endured what he could not.\nIf measured by self-preservation,\nmisfortune and disgrace could not touch him.\nThus, he was spared the fate of being hacked to pieces or felled like wood.\n\nZhan Qiupu said:\n*\"The Supreme Good resembles water—\nthus it incurs no blame.\"*\nIn the chapter *\"Changing Nature,\"*\nit says to replace my nature with water’s nature of benefiting others—\nhence, *\"The Supreme Good resembles water.\"*\nWater benefits all things without contention.\n\nYet water, though it benefits all,\nwhen it floods or dries, harms them.\nOnly by dwelling where others abhor\ndoes it nearly approach the Dao.\n\nWhy?\nThe body thrives on level ground,\nthe mind on depth.\nDeep and still, it aligns with broad benevolence.\nSpeech thrives on trust,\ngovernance on rectitude,\naction on timely opportunity.\nAll these harmonize self and others,\nbringing ease—\nthus the world naturally holds no grievance.\n\nMoreover, human nature is inherently good.\nWhy then compare the Supreme Good to water?\nThis is the most natural of transformations,\nyet it is sought through analogy.\n\nZhang Chongying said:\n*\"The Supreme Good resembles water—\nthus it incurs no blame.\"*\nWater’s nature is lowly and yielding.\nProbed, it is empty;\nobserved, it is clear.\nIn Heaven, it becomes rain or dew;\non Earth, rivers and streams.\nThe moving rely on it to float,\nthe rooted rely on it to grow,\nthe impure rely on it to cleanse,\nthe rigid rely on it to soften—\nall things depend on it to flourish.\nThus all things turn to it,\nall are nourished by its grace,\nyet there is no contention—\nno *\"this may enter, that may not.\"*\n\nThe common folk—\nthe world’s masses—\nwho does not revere the high and despise the low,\nwho does not wield rigidity to humiliate the gentle?\nThey fail to see that water’s lowliness and yielding\nhold a wondrous efficacy—\nnothing resists it.\n\nWhen a person’s nature aligns with water’s nature,\nthey become the Supreme Good.\nThus, its subtlety grows daily with the Dao.\nWherever they dwell, they nourish and flow—\ndwelling in the best places.\nIn the heart, they are empty, clear, and profound—\nthe mind is deeply settled.\n\nWhen applied to things, it nurtures them to completion—\nthus aligning with virtue and benevolence.\nWhen expressed in speech, it is true and unfeigned—\nthus aligning with sincerity and trust.\nWhen used to rectify others, it clarifies right from wrong—\nnaturally clear and just—\nthus aligning with righteous governance.\nWhen applied to affairs, it adapts to square and round, straight and curved,\nresponding flexibly yet appropriately—\nthus aligning with skillful action.\n\nAt dawn and dusk, day and night,\nrising and falling, ebbing and flowing—\nit neither depletes nor overacts,\nmoving only at the proper time.\n\nWhen the seven virtues are complete,\nsilently operating within,\nevil nature fades while virtuous nature arises—\nthus, no contention with others,\nno blame to bear.\n\nThis is called: *\"Only the non-contending thus has no blame.\"*\n\nWhite Crane of Jade said:\n*\"The Supreme Good is like water.\nIts nature is like water—\nwater is good.\nIt is not hindered by things—\nbenefiting all things yet not contending.\nWhat initial motive could there be?\nIt dwells where others revile—\nto me, what matter is there?\nThus, it approaches the Dao.\nThe heart is likewise:\ndwelling in the best places,\nchoosing nothing.\nThe heart is deeply settled—\nnurtured by something.\nAligning with virtue and benevolence—\nno distinction between self and other.\nSpeech aligns with sincerity—\ntrue and real.\nGovernance aligns with righteousness—\nnowhere unrighteous.\nAffairs align with skill—\neffortless yet nothing left undone.\nAction aligns with timing—\nmoving with the times.\nOnly the non-contending—\nthe mind uncompeting.\nThus, no blame.\nNor is this taken as fortune.\"*\n\nLiao Cuiran said:\n*\"The Supreme Good is like water.\nThe Dao’s wondrous operation,\nlike water’s flow.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend.\nThrough its yielding weakness,\nit submits to all things.\nDwelling where others revile—\nthe common folk use it daily without knowing,\nthis is the Dao’s essence.\nThus, it approaches the Dao.\nIt may be called the True Constant.\nDwelling in the best places—\nthus able to remain balanced.\nThe heart is deeply settled—\nthe mind ever-clear, perpetually pure.\nAligning with virtue and benevolence—\nbenefiting all beings.\nSpeech aligns with sincerity—\nmeaning uprightness.\nGovernance aligns with righteousness—\never upholding fairness.\nAffairs align with skill—\npure Dao qi in action.\nAction aligns with timing—\nmovement and rest in measure.\nOnly the non-contending—\nsubmitting to all uses, never opposing.\nThus, no blame.\nNo lingering resentment.\nIf one follows this,\nthus the Dao is achieved.\"*\n\nChen Bixu said:\n*\"The Supreme Good is like water.\nThe Supreme Good is the standard for humanity.\n'Like water' is a metaphor.\nThe perfected one holds an empty heart, no desires,\nadapting to change with the times,\nnot opposing any conditions,\ndwelling in goodness while forgetting goodness.\nThus, it is called Supreme Good.\nWater can conform to square and round,\ndeep and shallow, floating and sinking,\nfollowing the Dao, embracing emptiness—\nall things have their principles.\nOnly the sage encompasses and harmonizes them.\nThus, it is called 'like water.'\n\nMoreover, water embodies the three near-Dao abilities,\nthe seven virtues benefiting things—\nas elaborated below.\nWater benefits all things supremely,\nthus approaching the Dao.\nThis is the first near-Dao ability.\nWater’s nature is tranquil and even,\nspreading nourishment everywhere—\nheaven without water brings drought,\nearth without water raises dust.\nIt benefits all things,\nthus it is called 'beneficial.'\nThis is the first ability.\nNothing is softer or weaker than water,\nabandoning solidity for emptiness,\nrejecting high for low—\nblocked, it stops;\nunblocked, it flows,\nsubmitting to others.\nThus, it is called 'non-contending.'\nThis is the second ability.\nHuman nature dislikes lowliness,\nprefers high positions,\nyet water seeks the base, receives filth,\ndwelling in evil without disorder,\nmaking things pure and white,\nalone bearing defilement and humiliation.\nThus, it is called 'dwelling where others revile.'\nThis is the third ability.\n\n*'Near'* means *approaching*.\nWater’s beneficence broadens its benevolence,\nnon-contention radiates its virtue,\ndwelling in evil expands its tolerance—\nthe three abilities of water’s nature.\nOnly the perfected one’s unified virtue and conduct\nthus approach the Dao without straying.\nHence, it is called *near.*\n\nFurther explanation:\nWater is the origin of *qi*,\nruling the North.\nIts number is six.\nThe North is the beginning of yang virtue,\nthe end of yin qi.\nThe generating number is one,\nmatching the Dao.\nThe Dao is also called *one*—\nthe *one* of non-*one*.\nWater’s *one* is the *one* of *having one*.\nThe *one* of non-*one* is the Dao’s essence,\nthe *one* of *having one* is the Dao’s function.\nThus, water is the Dao’s function,\nhence it is said to *approach the Dao.*\n\nFrom *dwelling in the best places* to *action aligns with timing*—\nthe perfected one’s dwelling is in humble submission,\nfollowing things naturally,\ntransforming even the neighborhood,\nlike water on earth,\ndwelling in lowliness,\nnourishing all things.\nThus, it is said: *dwelling in the best places.*\nThis is the first virtue.\n\nThe perfected one’s heart preserves emptiness and stillness,\npenetrates profundity,\ndeeply clear and unobstructed,\nlike a watery abyss,\nwaves flowing in nine transformations,\nnever losing clarity and stillness.\nThus, it is said: *the heart is deeply settled.*\nThis is the second virtue.\n\nThe perfected one, if practicing virtue and benevolence,\nbenefits all under heaven,\nwithout partiality,\nlike water’s oily nourishment,\nskillfully ascending and descending,\nnothing left untouched.\nThus, it is said: *aligning with virtue and benevolence.*\nThis is the third virtue.\n\nThe perfected one’s speech upholds sincerity,\ndoes not bargain with things,\nnaturally harmonious,\nlike water’s reflection—\nbeauty and ugliness make no difference,\nflowing and filling, it moves,\nrisky yet unerring.\nThus, it is said: *speech aligns with sincerity.*\nThis is the fourth virtue.\n\nThe perfected one governing affairs\nrectifies the people,\nupright in demeanor, understanding things,\nthings naturally comply,\nlike water’s clarity and balance,\nskillfully settling high and low,\npurifying all things,\nleaving no filth.\nThus, it is said: *governance aligns with righteousness.*\nThis is the fifth virtue.\n\nThe perfected one, when handling affairs,\nskillfully employs things,\nassigning roles according to ability,\nlosing none of their potential.\nLike water’s yielding nature,\nskillfully serving square and round,\nadapting to form and vessel,\nnothing left unfinished.\nThus, it is said: *affairs align with skill.*\nThis is the sixth virtue.\n\nThe sage’s movement and stillness\nobserve the proper time,\nemerging and retiring according to circumstances,\npreserving the Dao,\nlike water’s movement—\nskillfully adapting to change,\nfreezing in winter, flowing in summer,\nnever missing its measure.\nThus, it is said: *action aligns with timing.*\"\n\nThe seventh virtue is thus said: *movement aligns with timing.*\n\nThis concludes the threefold discourse of the perfected one’s seven virtues. For the perfected one alone—\nthe one who does not vie—\nthere is no blame.\n\nThe perfected one’s thoughts, actions, comings, goings, words, and silences\nall harmonize with the **Mysterious Dao**,\nconform to what is fitting,\nand perpetually maintain **feminine stillness**,\nnever contending with things.\n\nIf things are not contended with,\nhow could there be any ground for blame?\n\nMoreover, *blame* is *resentment*.\nIt is said that in the world,\nonly the one who does not vie\nhas none to resent or blame.\n\n**Xie Tuonan** said:\n*The highest virtue is like water, approaching the Dao.*\n\nThe **Dao of the Great Learning** lies in stopping at the highest virtue.\nThis is called *highest virtue*—\nits utmost is here.\n\n**Mencius** said:\n*Human nature has no unvirtuous aspect,\njust as water has no place but to descend.*\nThe **Classics** state:\n*Only because the rivers and seas can descend\ndo they become rulers over all the valleys.*\nThus, when virtue is likened to water,\nit is taken from its ability to descend.\n\nOnly when a person can descend\ndo all virtues gather to them.\nOnly when water can descend\ndo all streams gather to it.\nTheir tendency is the same.\n\nWater nourishes all things without contending,\nits benefit lies in benefiting others, not itself.\nWhat the multitude abhors—\nlow, vile, sunken places—\nwater delights in, moving naturally,\nwithout choice or preference.\nThus, it approaches the Dao.\nThough this speaks of water,\nits true intent is for the virtuous person.\n\nThe virtuous person dwelling in the highest virtue\nhas no blame.\n\nHigh and low without preference,\nthus dwelling in the highest virtue.\nClear and pure, unshaken,\nthus the heart is virtuous in the depths.\nTake as you will, give as you will,\nthus it is virtuous in kindness.\nIf not level, it resounds,\nthus it is virtuous in truthfulness.\nIt reflects beauty and ugliness,\nthus governance is virtuous in regulation.\nIt bears weight, it floats weight,\nthus affairs are virtuous in capability.\nIts flow is unceasing,\nthus movement is virtuous in timing.\n\nIf benefit is so vast,\nif achievement is so great,\nyet it never contends with things,\nhow could there be blame or resentment?\n\nThough this speaks of water’s virtue,\nit truly speaks of human virtue.\nVirtue is water—\nnone other than the Dao’s abiding presence.\n\nIndeed, it has been discussed:\n*Heaven first generates water,*\n*water is the origin of the Five Phases,*\n*none is more exalted than water.*\nWater flows through the earth,\nnourishing all things—\nnone is greater than water.\nExalted yet not claiming its exaltation,\ngreat yet not possessing its greatness—\nthis is why virtue does not vie,\nand why, not vying, there is no blame.\n\nThe virtuous person’s virtue,\nif they befriend the virtue of one village, still consider it insufficient,\nif they befriend the virtue of one nation, still consider it insufficient,\nyet if they befriend the virtue of the world,\nthen they may attain the highest virtue.\n\nYet, the highest virtue is fitting to share with others,\njust as rivers and streams do not boast of the world,\nflowing together with the muddy—\nnot proud, not boastful—\nand the world has none to contend with them.\nThus, human virtue is water’s virtue.\n\nWater’s virtue is the Dao’s virtue.\nThe Dao dwells within me—\nturn inward to seek it,\nnurturing virtue in the **Mingyuan**,\nharmonizing **qi** in the **Xianzai**,\nand gathering its power in the **Water-Fire** of *Ji* and *Wei*.\nIn the end,\nvirtue dwells within me,\nwater dwells within me.\n\nIf I use this virtue well,\nI may share in the Dao’s enduring presence.\nIf not, what is water?\nWhat is water?\nWhy liken it to water?\n\n**Lin Yongzhai** said:\n*The highest virtue is like water, approaching the Dao.*\nThis chapter again uses water to illustrate the thought of having no self.\nThe highest virtue is the utmost virtue.\nIt is said that the world’s highest virtue\nis the same as water’s nature.\n\nWater’s virtue can benefit all things,\nyet when has it ever considered itself capable?\nFollowing the flow without opposing—\nthis is not vying.\nDescending to low places, embracing dampness—\nit does not regard what the world abhors as abhorrent.\nThus, observing water,\none comes near to the Dao.\n\n*Approaching* means *near*.\nDwelling in the highest virtue—\nit speaks of dwelling there and finding peace.\nThe heart is virtuous in the depths—\nit speaks of its steadfastness and tranquility.\nKindness extends to all—\nit speaks of its kindness reaching everywhere.\nTruthfulness in speech—\nit speaks of words always aligning with reality.\nGovernance is virtuous in regulation—\nusing it to govern the state,\nthe state will surely be well-ordered.\nAffairs are virtuous in capability—\nusing it to handle affairs,\nthere will be nothing it cannot accomplish.\nMovement aligns with timing—\nit moves as circumstances dictate,\nalways finding the proper moment.\n\nThese seven lines speak of those with the Dao,\nwhose words are such,\nyet they do not consider themselves capable,\nthus in the world\nthey vie with none,\nand none resent or blame them.\nThis is the meaning of:\n*You alone do not vie,*\n*thus the world has none to vie with you.*\n\nThose who understand well\noften mistake this as the *seven lesser virtues of water*,\nthus their interpretations are strained and forced,\nnot the original intent of **Laozi**.\n\n**Fan Yingyuan** said:\n*The highest virtue is like water, approaching the Dao.*\n*Approaching* means *near*.\nWater, as a thing,\nreceives the **Heavenly One’s qi**,\nhas no fixed form yet permeates all,\nthus none can nourish as water does—\nit is the utmost in benefiting others.\nIt is square when encountering square,\nit is round when encountering round—\nwhat vying is there?\n\nThe highest virtue in a person\nis subtle, profound, and all-pervading,\nconstantly benefiting others without contending,\nthus virtue is like water.\nThe multitude prefers high and abhors low,\nyet water alone dwells there—\nthe highest virtue in a person\nis always humble and lowly.\nWith such virtue,\nthey approach the Dao.\n\nAmong the **Sixty-Four Hexagrams of the *Yijing***,\nonly the **Modesty** hexagram has auspiciousness without misfortune, regret, or stinginess.\n**River Master Gong** said:\n*The highest virtue in a person is like water’s nature.*\nThus, it is said:\n*The highest virtue is like water.*\n\nWater is naturally formless,\nthus its principle aligns with the Dao—\nomnipresent, benefiting all,\njust as water does.\nHowever, once it has taken form,\nit diverges from the Dao.\nThus, it is said:\n*approaching the Dao.*\n\nYet it can still be named virtue—\nnone surpasses it,\nthus it is called *highest virtue.*\n\nDwelling in the highest virtue,\nthus without blame.\n\nThe virtuous in dwelling choose the good ground—\nwhen they may rest, they rest;\nthe virtuous in heart are deep—\ntheir mind ever serene and still;\nthe virtuous in benevolence act justly—\nmeasuring things and distributing fairly;\nthe virtuous in speech are trustworthy—\ntheir words never false or idle;\nthe virtuous in governance rule with virtue—\ntheir power is without private gain;\nthe virtuous in action are skilled—\nin all things, they excel;\nthe virtuous in timing act decisively—\nwhen they may move, they move.\n\nWith such virtue and such excellence,\nthey alone contend not—\nthus they have no fault,\nand their virtue is complete, their excellence perfect.\n\nMaster Xue Yongqi said:\n*The highest virtue is like water—\nits excellence lies in timely action.*\n\nThe noble of highest virtue are clear in nature and pure in virtue,\nthus they are like water.\n\nRain and dew nourish,\nsprings and streams irrigate—\nbenefiting all things.\nFlowing, they moisten what is low,\nstagnant, they gather filth—\ndwelling where all others abhor.\nWater generates *Heaven One*,\nthe Dao is without singularity—\nthus it is said to approach the Dao.\n\nDammed, it becomes a nation’s treasure;\nreleased, it becomes a nation’s benefit—\nthis is the good ground.\nReflected in still waters, its depths are measured—\nthis is the deep heart.\nNourishing all things, yet claiming no credit—\nthis is benevolence.\nAll rivers learn from the sea,\nyet they reach the sea—\nthis is trustworthiness.\nFilth is cleansed, high and low are balanced—\nthis is good governance.\nIn a square vessel, it is square;\nin a round vessel, it is round—\nthis is skill.\nIn winter, it congeals;\nin spring, it melts—\nthis is timely action.\nFor it does not contend,\nthus it has no blame.\n\nUnder heaven, none are softer or weaker than water—\nthus it does not contend.\nSince it does not contend,\nwhat blame could there be?\n\nMaster Xu Xiuxian said:\n*The highest virtue is like water—\nthus it has no blame.*\n\nThe Dao’s supreme virtue\nis called highest excellence.\nWater can benefit all things\nyet does not vie for merit—\nno selfishness.\nWater seeks what is low—\nthis is dwelling where all others abhor.\nWater has no mind yet possesses virtue.\nThus it approaches the Dao.\n*Approach* means *near*.\n\nThose who embrace the Dao with supreme virtue,\nin action and stillness alike,\nare like those who dwell in the good ground.\nTheir measure encompasses all—\nthis is the deep heart.\nThey bestow widely and aid the masses,\nyet take no pride—\nthis is benevolence.\nTheir words are models for others—\nthis is trustworthiness.\nThe transformation of virtue and the Dao\nspreads like wind through grass—\nthis is good governance.\nEffortless yet wondrous,\nachieving without labor—\nthis is skill.\nThey speak not against reason,\nact not against the Dao—\nthis is timely action.\nFollowing the Dao in all things,\nwith no contention between self and other—\nthus they have no fault or blame.\n\nMaster Zhu Bo-xiu said:\n*The highest virtue is like water—\nthus it benefits all without contention.*\n\nExcellence upon excellence,\nthus it is called highest excellence.\nTo say *like water* means\nthat under heaven, no excellence surpasses water.\nMoreover, all things arise from yin and moisture—\nthus it is said water benefits all things.\nWater’s nature follows circumstances,\nneither choosing nor rejecting good or ill,\nwhether in large or small, square or round vessels—\nall receive its full measure.\nIt yields to all taking and giving,\nnever resisting.\nThus it is said to contend not.\n\nThen too, the nature of the virtuous person\nis like water.\nTheir ability to conform to square or round,\nto decline high and embrace low,\nto contain rivers and accept all—\nnot contending with the world—\nis like water’s nature,\nspread throughout heaven and earth without exclusion.\n\nDwelling where all others abhor,\nthus it approaches the Dao.\nFor what all others abhor\nis to dwell in low places,\nand though all things under heaven strive upward,\nwater’s virtue does not delight in height—\nit alone can dwell low.\n\nConfucius often praised water, saying:\n*\"Water, water—\nwhat can be learned from water?\"*\nMencius said:\n*\"The springs surge ceaselessly,\nday and night without pause,\nfilling each basin before advancing,\nflowing unrestrained to the four seas—\nsuch is the way of those with roots.\"*\n\nThis is the virtue of water.\nYet what does *approach the Dao* mean?\n*Approach* means *near*.\nThe Dao is the deep source.\nWater’s use in the world\nis like the Dao’s presence under heaven—\nno thing escapes its nourishment,\nno place its moistening.\nThus it is said to approach the Dao.\n\nThough water’s nature is always descending,\nhuman nature is also without fail virtuous.\n\nMencius said: *\"Human nature’s goodness is like water’s tendency to descend. How could it not approach the Dao?\"*\n**Reside in virtuous places.**\nIt is said that water’s virtue has seven excellences.\nIt stands first among the Five Phases and is the sovereign of all grains—\nit does not flow unless released,\nit does not advance until its basin is full.\nIf the land grows slightly steep, there is no talk of backflow or reversal;\nif the land rises slightly, there is the meaning of unceasing streams.\nOnly in level, stable places does it rest—\nthus it is said to reside in virtuous places.\n\n**The heart is virtuous in depth.**\nThe heart refers to water’s core.\nLike the depths of rivers and seas—\nvast and boundless,\nstirred yet never turbid,\nsettled yet ever clearer—\nit can contain all rivers,\ncarrying everything without discrimination,\nreflecting forms without bias—\nthus it is said the heart is virtuous in depth.\n\n**Generosity is virtuous in kindness.**\nKindness means unceasing life-giving.\nWater’s virtue flows ceaselessly, transforming without end,\nspreading across the land, bearing forms,\nfloating beneath the sky, bathing in the sun—\nits use is unrestricted, its benefit inexhaustible.\nIts virtue matches the Heaven-Earth’s unceasing life-giving mechanism—\nthus it is said generosity is virtuous in kindness.\n\n**Speech is virtuous in trustworthiness.**\nIts meaning is that water’s virtue is sincere without constraint—\nas the ancients praised: *\"Great trustworthiness requires no oaths.\"*\nObserve its function:\nEast Sea departs, West Sea arrives,\ncycling endlessly without fail—\nlike the Tailu’s drainage, flowing from the Milky Way’s heights\nto the ocean’s depths,\ncompleting a cycle each year,\nnever failing in sincerity—\nthus it is said speech is virtuous in trustworthiness.\n\n**Governance is virtuous in order.**\nWater’s virtue can float the Ten Isles beyond things,\nsuspend the Six Directions within the cosmos,\nalter the mulberry fields into sands,\nrelocate islands time and again—\naccepting both vast and minute,\ncleansing impurities without omission,\nembodying Heaven’s utmost softness,\nconquering Earth’s utmost firmness,\npenetrating even the unyielding—\nthus it is said governance is virtuous in order.\n\n**Action is virtuous in capability.**\nWater’s use is soft yet strong,\nweak yet powerful—\nnourishing all life,\nmoistening the Nine Realms,\ncirculating through Heaven and Earth,\npiercing firmness and hardness,\nturning land into depths,\nboring through cliffs and stone,\nleveling heights to lows,\ndiscarding filth while preserving clarity—\nHeaven and Earth rely on its transformative function,\ncreatures and plants benefit from its sustenance—\nthus it is said action is virtuous in capability.\n\n**Movement is virtuous in timing.**\nWater’s function is ever-flowing, ever-moving.\nThe ancients said: *\"Flowing water does not rot\"—\nhow could it not be virtuous?*\nThe Classics state: *\"Nothing under heaven is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing surpasses it in overcoming firmness.\"*\nIts operation cannot be altered—\nlike tidal seas arriving only at their appointed time,\nlike human reliance on water and fire moving only when needed—\nthus it is said movement is virtuous in timing.\n\n**Only the non-contending has no regrets.**\n*Only*—a particle of emphasis.\n*Regrets*—remorse and grudges.\nThis speaks of water’s virtue not contending with things,\nthus having no remorse or grudges.\nOnce, Zigong asked: *\"Why does a gentleman observe great waters?\"*\nConfucius replied: *\"Great waters resemble virtue, resemble the Dao,\nresemble courage yet seem timid,\nresemble rectitude yet seem discerning,\nresemble resolve yet seem benevolent in transformation.\"*\nWater’s virtue is such—\nthus a gentleman must observe it.\nFrom this, how could there be regrets or grudges?\nYang Zhiren said: *\"The utmost goodness is like water—thus no regrets.\"*\nIt means the Dao-holding sage’s nature is like water:\nkind to the people, beneficial to all things,\nperturbed yet not defiled, clarified yet not artificially pure,\nnaturally descending while disdaining elevation—\nwhen poured into a square vessel, it becomes square;\nwhen poured into a round vessel, it becomes round.\nRivers and streams grow long because of this,\nthe Five Phases stand firm because of this.\n*The Book of Transformation* says:\n*\"Water’s hollows can drown one—\nthus it approaches the Dao.\"*\nIt nourishes all things, resides in virtuous places.\nDeep and luminous, the heart is virtuous in depth.\nAll things gain life from water—\ngenerosity is virtuous in kindness.\nIt reflects forms without losing their essence—\nspeech is virtuous in trustworthiness.\nClear and smooth, governance is virtuous in order.\nIt can be square or round, curved or straight—\naction is virtuous in capability.\nIt melts in summer and congeals in winter—\nmovement is virtuous in timing.\nOnly the non-contending—\nits Dao is profound.\nThus there are no regrets.\n\nMencius said: *\"Human nature’s goodness is like water’s tendency to descend.\nNo one is without goodness, just as water is without fail descending.\"*\nYu Qingzhong said: *\"The utmost goodness is like water—thus no regrets.\"*\nWater is called *\"moistening the low\"*—\ndwelling in the most humble, damp places,\nwhich all people despise.\nWater is an emotionless thing—\nnothing under heaven is as level as water.\nThe truly virtuous person resembles it.\nThe *utmost goodness* refers to those of supreme virtue and perfection.\nAccording to old teachings, water embodies three near-Dao abilities and seven virtues beneficial to things.\nWhat are the three abilities?\nWater’s nature is tranquil and disperses to nourish all—\nHeaven without water would be parched,\nEarth without water would wither—\nbenefiting all things—\nthis is the first ability.\nNothing under heaven is softer or weaker than water—\nit abandons solidity for emptiness,\nrejects height for lowliness—\nblocked, it stops;\nreleased, it flows;\nsubmitting to human command—\nthis is the second ability.\nThough people dislike dwelling in low places,\nwater seeks the low and damp,\nmaking things pure while receiving filth—\nthis is the third ability.\n*Near*—meaning *close*.\nHeaven generates water—*one*—the Dao.\nThe Dao’s *one* is the non-dual *one*,\nwater’s *one* is the dual *one*.\nThe non-dual *one* is the Dao’s essence,\nthe dual *one* is the Dao’s function—\nthus it is said to approach the Dao.\n\nWhat are the seven virtues?\nThe sage’s dwelling is virtuous in humility,\nfollowing things naturally,\ntransforming even the neighborhood—\nlike water on the earth,\nvirtuous in descending to low places,\nnourishing all things.\n\n「Hence it is said: *Dwelling is virtuous in the land*.\nThis is the first virtue.\n\nThe sage’s heart is clear and deep,\npenetrating to the most subtle depths,\ntranquil and unobstructed—\nlike a watery abyss, undisturbed,\nnever losing its clarity and stillness—\nhence it is said: *The heart is virtuous in its depth*.\nThis is the second virtue.\n\nThe sage’s giving is benevolent and kind,\nextending to all without distinction of near or far—\nlike the grease of water, nourishing,\npermeating all things universally,\nwithout limit or restraint.\nHence it is said: *Giving is virtuous in its kindness*.\nThis is the third virtue.\n\nThe sage’s words are sincere and steadfast,\nunalterable, harmonizing with all things—\nlike the tides responding to celestial cues,\nswelling and receding day and night,\nnever missing their appointed moments.\nHence it is said: *Speech is virtuous in its trustworthiness*.\nThis is the fourth virtue.\n\nThe sage governs with equanimity,\ntreating all with a balanced heart,\nnaturally yielding to order—\nnothing remains ungoverned,\nlike clear water, virtuous in stabilizing high and low,\ndistinguishing beauty and ugliness on its own,\nwith no thing escaping its form.\nHence it is said: *Governance is virtuous in its efficacy*.\nThis is the fifth virtue.\n\nThe sage confronts affairs,\nvirtuous in its ability to adapt to things,\nassigning roles according to capacity,\neach fitting their measure—\nlike water’s yielding nature,\naccommodating to square or round,\nlong or short,\nadapting to every vessel,\nwith no application beyond its reach.\nHence it is said: *Affairs are virtued in their ability*.\nThis is the sixth virtue.\n\nThe sage’s movement and stillness,\nalign with the world’s shifts,\nemerging and retiring as circumstances demand,\nnever stagnating in things—\nlike water’s motion,\nchanging with the seasons,\ncongealing in winter and flowing in summer,\nnever deviating from its course.\nHence it is said: *Movement is virtuous in its timing*.\nThis is the seventh virtue.\n\nAll things that are not level,\nfind their resolution in water and cease their striving—\nhow then could there be blame?\nTo observe water is an art,\nand it may be said to be masterful in its form and function.\n\nConfucius observed the flowing waters of the east,\nand Zigong asked: *\"Why does the gentleman always observe great waters?\"*\nConfucius replied: *\"Because it never rests—\nwater seems to embody **virtue** (德).\nIts flow is low and humble,\nand when it carves through cities,\nit must first smooth its path—\nthis seems like **righteousness** (義).\nIts vastness knows no end,\nthis seems like the **Dao/Way** (道).\nIt rushes to depths a hundred fathoms high without fear,\nthis seems like **courage** (勇).\nWhen measured, it is always level—\nthis seems like its **fullness** (盛).\nYet it does not seek to irrigate—\nthis seems like **rectitude** (正).\nIts subtle currents reach everywhere—\nthis seems like **perception** (察).\nIts source always flows east—\nthis seems like **purpose** (志).\nIt emerges and withdraws,\nand all things conform and transform—\nthis seems like **virtuous transformation** (善化).\nThus, water’s virtues are such—\nthe gentleman must observe them.\nThe ancients indeed took inspiration from water,\nand there was good reason for it.\n\nXú Liúxū said: *\"The highest virtue is like water—\nthus it approaches the Dao.\nThe one who embodies the Dao is called the highest virtue.\nThe highest virtue is beyond compare—\nonly water can illustrate it.\nHence it is said: **The highest virtue is like water** (上善若水).\n\nWater’s virtue is beyond improvement:\nit benefits all things without striving,\nnourishes with its dampness and seeks low places,\ndwelling where people abhor.\nAll filth and evil,\nit receives and purifies—\nthus it approaches the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is but a hair’s breadth away.\n**Dwelling is virtuous in the land**—\nresting in the **Kàn** (坎), descending to low places.\n**The heart is virtuous in its depth**—\ntranquil and clear, reflecting all things.\n**Giving is virtuous in its kindness**—\nbenefiting and nourishing all things.\n**Speech is virtuous in its trustworthiness**—\ntides and currents come on time.\n**Governance is virtuous in its efficacy**—\nlevel, it makes no sound.\n**Affairs are virtued in their ability**—\nirrigating with purpose.\n**Movement is virtuous in its timing**—\nspring rises, autumn ebbs.\nSince it does not strive,\nthere is no blame.\nIt takes virtue as its essence,\nand non-striving as its function—\nthus in every use, there is no fault.\n\nSū Jìng said: *\"The highest virtue is like water—\nthus it is without blame.\nThis passage of Laozi’s intent\nlies solely in **non-striving** (不争).\nThe highest virtue is the foremost and most excellent principle in the world.\nCompare it to nothing like water:\nall things rely on water to flourish—\nthis is its virtue in benefiting.\nYet water never claims to be of benefit—\npeople abhor dwelling in low places,\nbut water flows where it is damp,\ndwelling where people abhor,\nyet never complains.\nIf one can embody water’s virtue—\nto benefit the world with nourishment—\nand yet lack the desire to seek high or distant things,\nthen they are the highest virtue,\nand also approach the Dao.\n\nHow does the one who embodies the Dao\ncompare to water in virtue?\nTheir dwelling must always be in low places—\nlike water benefiting things.\nTheir heart must always be deep and still—\nlike water’s tranquil repose.\nTheir giving must always be expansive and beneficent—\nlike water irrigating the withered.\nTheir trust must always be in truth—\nlike water’s surge and ebb, which must make sound.\nTheir governance must always be orderly—\nlike water flowing smoothly downward.\nTheir handling of affairs must always suit their abilities—\nlike water’s swift and rapid currents.\"*\n\nThe virtuous in action must discern the times well—\nlike water swelling in summer and receding in autumn.\n\nThese seven virtues are all like water’s goodness,\nyet they do not yet reach water’s highest virtue.\nWater’s supreme virtue lies in not contending for gain?\nFor only by not contending does one avoid blame.\n\nThis is how Yu was without arrogance—\nnone in the world dared contend with his virtue.\nYu was without self-praise—\nnone in the world dared contend with his deeds.\nWhat is this if not the world’s highest virtue?\n\nThe teachings of Laozi are most profound in \"not contending\":\n\"Hold not the worthy in high esteem, so the people do not contend.\"\n\"Only by not contending can one be uncontested in the world.\"\n\"This is called the virtue of not contending.\"\n\"The Dao of Heaven is uncontested yet triumphs.\"\n\"The Sage’s Way acts without contending.\"\nThese six all speak of the virtue of not contending without blame.\n\nThe utterance of the heart cannot be concealed.\nAll insults and humiliations, though shameful,\ncan be endured and borne—\nthis is the ability to act and yet not act.\nOne’s talents and strength may suffice to surpass the world,\nyet they are concealed and unused.\nTheir actions never seek to lead the world,\nhow then could there be contention?\nThus, they are truly the highest virtue.\n\nMaster Ben-yuan of the Upper Hut said:\n\"The highest virtue is like water—\nso perfect that there is no blame.\nWithout virtue to name, it is perfect.\nWith virtue to name, yet acting as water does naturally—\nthis is the virtue beyond virtue.\n\nTo benefit all things is to have merit,\nand having merit invites contention.\nTo have merit yet not contend is difficult.\nYet to dwell where others abhor, without complaint—\nis this not even more difficult?\n\nThe one approaching the Dao\nis second only to the nameless Dao itself.\n\nResidence, heart, giving, speech, governance, affairs, and action—\nthese are human matters.\nThe good at choosing dwelling are like water’s high and low,\nfollowing the land.\nThe good at depth are like water’s stillness and profundity,\nunshaken.\nThe good at benevolence are like water’s boundless nourishment.\nThe good at trust are like water’s unerring course,\nneither deceiving nor delayed.\nThe good at governance are like water’s cleansing flow,\nunobstructed.\nThe good at ability are like water’s adaptability—\nto vessels, square or round, straight or curved.\nThe good at timing are like water’s ebb and flow,\nspring’s fullness and autumn’s retreat,\nnever missing its measure.\n\nAll these follow their natural course,\ncompeting with nothing—\nthus, they never incur the slightest blame.\n\nStone Pool says:\n\"The highest virtue is like water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\ndwelling where others abhor—\nthus, it approaches the Dao.\n\nResidence is good at choosing dwelling,\nthe heart is good at depth,\ngiving is good at benevolence,\nspeech is good at trust,\ngovernance is good at order,\naffairs are good at ability,\naction is good at timing.\n\nOnly by not contending does one avoid blame.\nThe highest virtue is like water—\nusing water’s virtues to illustrate human virtue.\n\nWater benefits all things,\nand all things thrive where water flows.\nThe uncontested—\nthough water benefits all things,\nit never competes with them.\nDwelling where others abhor—\nwater’s nature is to nourish the low,\nyet people despise the low.\nOnly by not contending and dwelling in the place others abhor\ndoes one approach the Dao.\n\nIf one’s dwelling is good like water’s nourishment,\nthe heart is deep like water’s stillness,\ngiving is benevolent like water’s boundless flow,\nspeech is trustworthy like the tides’ punctuality,\ngovernance is orderly like water’s reflection of all things—\nhigh and low, fair and foul—\nwithout omitting a form,\naffairs are handled with ability like water’s adaptability—\nto square or round, straight or curved—\nactions are timed like water’s spring swelling and autumn’s retreat,\nnever missing its rhythm—\nall these follow their natural course,\ncompeting with nothing—\nthus, they never incur the slightest blame.\n\nFrom *Residence in Good Dwelling* onward,\nthis chapter speaks of human highest virtue resembling water.\nIf one seeks only in water, then speech and governance are not addressed.\n\nThe earlier text says:\n\"Water benefits all things yet does not contend—\nthus, it approaches the Dao.\"\nThis speaks of water’s virtue.\n*Residence in Good Dwelling* and the seven virtues\nspeak of human virtue resembling water’s virtue.\nIts essence lies in not contending.\n\n*The Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing, Volume Thirteen*\nCompiled by Master Jingyuan of the Remote and Far,\nSupervisor of Observances at Xuanmiao Guan,\nEdited by Liu Weiyong,\nCorrected by Ding Yidong,\nFormerly a Palace Attendant and Compiler at the Gunucimi Yuan,\nAlso a Clerk at the Taifu Temple.\n\n「Comparative Analysis: Master He Shang composed *The Chapter of the Wandering Yi* (《运夷章》), while Zhao Shixian wrote *The Chapter of Observing Retreat as Advancement* (《观退为进义章》).\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang explained: The previous chapter elucidates the virtuous conduct of the sage—gentle and yielding, hence free from blame. This chapter clarifies how the common folk, drowned in desires and arrogant with excess, inevitably incur fault.\n\nIt begins with the admonition **\"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt\"** (持而盈之, 不如其已。 揣而锐之, 不可长保), showing how such states are hard to preserve. Next, it warns of gold and jade, wealth and honor, cautioning against greed. It concludes with **\"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw\"** (功成名遂身退), urging one to forget merit and avoid harm.\n\nMaster Du Guangting remarked: The previous chapter used water as an analogy to illustrate the Way of cultivation. Here, with **\"Hold and it will overflow\"**** as its opening, it further reveals the folly of greed and stagnation, urging one to forget merit and retreat, thus aligning with the sage’s perfection.\n\nZhang Chongying stated: *Yi* refers to the boundless void of the cosmos—clear and luminous yet without form or color—unfathomable by humans. Though human affairs may flow like that void, if one prevents others from perceiving them, it is akin to concealing one’s spirit and avoiding self-harm.\n\n**\"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt\"** (持而盈之, 不如其已。 揣而锐之, 不可长保).\n**\"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them\"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).\n**\"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame\"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).\n**\"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven\"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).\n\nComparative Analysis: Yan Zun, Yang Fu, and Wang Bi all concurred with the ancient text.\n\nMaster He Shang said: **\"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt\"** (持而盈之, 不如其已).\n*Sweng*, meaning \"full,\" *ji*, meaning \"stop.\"\nTo hold what is full is to risk collapse—better to stop.\n\n**\"Grasp and it will blunt\"** (揣而锐之, 不可长保).\n*Chuai*, meaning \"to refine.\"\nAfter refinement, it must be discarded—its sharpness cannot endure.\n\n**\"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them\"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).\nLustful desires harm the spirit, riches burden the body.\n\n**\"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame\"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).\nIf one is wealthy, they should relieve the poor; if noble, they should pity the lowly. Yet if they instead grow arrogant, calamity will surely befall them.\n\n**\"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven\"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).\nIt means that when a person’s deeds are accomplished and their reputation secured, if they do not retreat and relinquish their prominence, they will meet misfortune. This is Heaven’s constant Way.\n\nAs the sun reaches its zenith and begins to decline, the moon wanes after fullness, things flourish only to decay, and joy reaches its peak before sorrow follows.\n\nWang Fu’s commentary: **\"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt\"** (持而盈之, 不如其已).\n*Chi* means \"to hold without losing virtue,\" but if one holds virtue while also filling oneself with excess, collapse is inevitable. Thus, it is better to stop—meaning to be even worse than having no virtue or merit at all.\n\n**\"Grasp and it will blunt\"** (揣而锐之, 不可长保).\nIf one refines and sharpens it further after already making it sharp, its force will only be exhausted and ruined—thus it cannot be long preserved.\n\n**\"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them\"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).\nIt is better to stop.\n\n**\"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame\"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).\nIt cannot be long preserved.\n\n**\"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven\"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).\nThe seasons cycle in turn, and when merit is fulfilled, one must withdraw.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong remarked: **\"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt\"** (持而盈之, 不如其已).\nTo grasp and fill with excess, lest it topple—if one accumulates, it becomes a burden, and regret will arise. Hence, it is better to stop.\n*Ji*, meaning \"to stop.\"\n\nExplanation: *Chi* means \"to grasp,\" *sweng* means \"full,\" *ji* means \"to stop.\"\nIt speaks of how human hearts, greedy and insatiable, grasp and hoard, filling themselves with wealth. Accumulation brings burdens, and regret will inevitably follow. Thus, the sage warns: It is better to cease.\n\n**\"Grasp and it will blunt\"** (揣而锐之, 不可长保).\n*Chuai* means \"to measure or refine,\" *rui* means \"sharp and keen.\"\nTo refine and sharpen desires for fame and honor, to cling to power and rely on wealth—if one accumulates to fullness, arrogance will arise, and ruin will follow. Thus, it cannot be long preserved.\n\nExplanation: *Chuai* means \"to measure or assess,\" *rui* means \"sharp and keen.\"\nAll who are mired in desires, greedy for fame and gain, assess past deeds and sharpen their ambition, provoking resentment and inviting ruin. Hence, it cannot be long preserved.\n\n**\"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them\"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).\nThis illustrates how excess is difficult to sustain.\n\nExplanation: Suppose one’s greed knows no bounds, filling their halls with gold and jade. Even elephants are tamed by fire, and roosters mutilated for ritual propriety. Yet, by losing the treasure of non-greed, one invites the anxiety of bandits. With such harm, how can they be guarded? This reverses the meaning of **\"Hold and it will overflow.\"**\n\n**\"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame\"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).\nThis reveals how sharpness cannot be grasped—arrogance stems from the heart, so blame is not from another.\n\nExplanation: Wealth attracts envy, so one easily oppresses others. Honor demands deference, so one readily domineers over others. Arrogance and excess arise without warning; calamity follows without cause. Regret comes from arrogance itself, born of the heart. Hence, it is said: one invites blame upon themselves. This reverses the meaning of **\"Grasp and it will blunt.\"**\n\n**\"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven\"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).\nThose whose achievements are complete and reputation secured should retreat and avoid excess—just as Heaven’s Way follows the cycles of fullness and emptiness. Thus, there will be no misfortune.\n\nExplanation: This is an admonition. Fullness invites loss, while humility brings benefit. Even Heaven does not remain perpetually full, so those who achieve will be humbled, and those who gain fame will suffer decline. To seek long preservation is unheard of. One must instead forget merit and fame, retreat, and relinquish excess—like Heaven’s Way. Only by not defying the cycles of fullness and emptiness can one avoid calamity and censure.\n\nMaster Du Guangting said: The analogy of **\"Hold and it will overflow\"**** encompasses four meanings.\nOne: Clinging to desires until they reach fullness.\nTwo: Hoarding worldly wealth until it overflows.\nThree: Persisting in evil deeds until they swell.\nFour: Grasping authority and relying on office until they become excessive.\n\nIn general, those who know only advancement and forget retreat, who do not reflect on the Dao of virtue, who cling stubbornly without turning back—all such as reach fullness will meet retribution. Those whose desires overflow will suffer from feebleness and illness, harming their lives. Those whose worldly wealth overflows will face plunder and loss.\n\nThe evil deeds that reach fullness will meet retribution through punishment, calamity, and harm.\nThose whose power and emoluments overflow will face ruin and annihilation.\nThus, the Venerable Lord Lao admonishes: *\"It is better to cease than to persist in holding fullness.*\nIf one neither ceases nor stops, retribution will surely manifest.\nTo sharpen and press forward is not something that can be long preserved.\n\nWhen a ruler sharpens his ambition to expand territory and seize land, the people will resent it and the state will perish.\nWhen a minister sharpens his greed for profit and fame, his own life will be endangered and disaster will follow.\nEven if he temporarily gains what he desires, how can it last?\nMoreover, advancement brings no benefit, while retreat brings only worry and misfortune.\nHence, it is said: *\"It cannot be long preserved.*\n\nGold and jade filling the halls cannot be guarded forever.\nEven if one could measure and discern, and sharply curb avarice, filling the halls with treasures and ornaments—\nthere will still be plunder and attack, how could one preserve and guard them?\nMuch less can one, with a limited lifespan and insatiable desires, hope to preserve gold and jade when death cannot be averted.\n\nThere is the parable of the elephant burning itself with its own tusks:\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Shànggōng Year 24, when the Jin minister Fán Xuānzǐ governed, the burdens on the allied states grew heavy, and the people of Zheng lamented.\nIn the second month, the Duke of Zheng visited Jin.\nZǐchǎn entrusted a letter to Zǐxī to convey to Xuānzǐ:\n*\"You govern Jin, yet the neighboring states hear only of heavy burdens, not of virtuous governance. I am perplexed by this.\nI have heard that those who govern states must fear not the lack of wealth, but the difficulty of earning a virtuous name.\nWhen wealth accumulates in the lord’s halls, the states grow disloyal.\nIf you rely on it, Jin will become disloyal.\nWhen the states are disloyal, Jin will collapse; when Jin collapses, your house will fall.\nWhy would you court such ruin?\nWealth is but a vehicle for virtue, and virtue is the foundation of a state.\nWith a foundation, there is no collapse—why not strive for this?\nVirtue brings joy, and joy ensures longevity. The *Odes* say:\n‘Joy belongs to the virtuous; it is the foundation of the state.’\nThus, it is the virtuous name that matters.\nReflect deeply to cultivate virtue, let your virtuous name spread far and near, and all will be at peace.\nWould you rather have people say, ‘You gave life to us,’ or ‘You drained us to death?’\nThe elephant burns itself with its own tusks—wealth is like that.\nXuānzǐ was pleased and lightened the burdens.\nThis was the reason the Duke of Zheng visited Jin—because of the heavy burdens.\n\nThe rooster that cuts off its own tail:\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*’ transmission of Zǐzhāo, son of King Jìng of Zhou, Mèng Shì went to the suburbs and saw a rooster cut off its own tail, sighing:\n‘The use of sacrificial animals depends on their completeness and fatness.\nNow it cuts off its own tail, making itself incomplete, hoping to avoid being used as a sacrifice.\nThus does the rooster preserve its life—how much more so for humans?\nTo covet gain and forget oneself is even worse than the rooster’s folly.\n\nThe treasure of non-covetousness:\nA man of Zheng found a jade piece and offered it to Zǐhǎn, saying:\n‘This is a treasure. I would present it to you.’\nZǐhǎn replied:\n‘You consider jade a treasure, but I consider non-covetousness a treasure.\nIf I take the jade, we both lose our treasures.\nIt is better to preserve both.’\nThus, he did not accept the jade.\n\nThe thief who invites plunder:\nThe *Yì* explains the third line of the *Guà* hexagram:\n‘*Bearing and mounting, bringing thieves upon oneself.*’\nBearing refers to the petty man’s burden—carrying burdens for others.\nMounting refers to the noble’s carriage.\nNow the petty man abandons his burden and takes the noble’s carriage—\nthis is the petty man riding in the noble’s instrument.\nThus, thieves will think to seize it.\nArrogance in wealth and rank invites one’s own downfall.\nAbundance is called wealth, so people seek it.\nHigh position is called rank, so people submit to it.\nIf one is full without overflowing, this is how one long preserves wealth.\nIf one is high without peril, this is how one long preserves rank.\nThe saying goes: *\"Wealth and rank do not last for the arrogant and extravagant—\narrogance and extravagance bring their own ruin.\nIf one does not guard against them, contempt and insults will follow,\nand disaster will surely come.\n‘Hereditary’ means ‘given by oneself.’\nBlame does not come from outside—it arises from one’s own arrogance and negligence.\nHence, it is said: *\"Arrogance comes from the heart.\nIf one can be high in rank without peril, wealthy without overflowing,\nfree from grievances, and disaster-free,\nthen governing the state and cultivating oneself is perfect.\n\nArrogance is pride.\nWhen achievement is complete and fame is fulfilled, one should retreat—this is the Way of Heaven.\nTo avert disaster and eliminate misfortune is called *achievement*,\nwealth, rank, honor, and glory are called *fame*.\nIf achievement is complete and fame is fulfilled, yet one does not know when to retreat,\nfew escape calamity.\nWhy is this?\nFavor invites disgrace, fullness invites decline, and extremism invites regret.\nWhen fine birds are exhausted, the good bow is hidden;\nwhen the hare is killed, the hunting dogs are boiled—\nthis is the inevitable course of things.\nFàn Lì escaped disaster in a small boat, while Dàfū Zhōu lost his life clinging to his position—\nthis is the lesson.\n\nThe sun reaches its zenith and then declines,\nthe moon is full and then wanes,\nheat gives way to cold,\nspring’s flourishing turns to autumn’s fall—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\nIf one aligns with the cycles of fullness and emptiness in Heaven’s Way,\nforgets the pursuit of achievement and fame,\nand like Zǐfáng abstains from food to wander freely,\nor like Cú Guāng resigns his seal to live in refinement,\nthen there will be no regret like that of Cāi Huàtíng or Huàtíng’s pursuit.\nHow much more so for one who holds the *jiǔwǔ* position and governs the myriad people,\nilluminating the four quarters and regulating the seas,\nyet does not heed the warning against holding fullness to excess?\n\nThe Lord of Song’s Way says:\n*Holding fullness to excess cannot be long preserved.\nFullness leads to overflow, sharpness leads to blunting.\nThe principle of all things is that fullness must have its deficiency.\nIf one does not know to hold emptiness in readiness for fullness,\nor to grasp emptiness to govern fullness,\nand instead indulges in the desires of overflow and sharpness,\none only increases the calamity of ruin.\nThe changes of things are boundless, but human wisdom is limited.\nPreemptive knowledge is the flower of the Way, the beginning of folly.\nIf one measures things by their nature yet sharpens his pursuit of immediate gain,\nhis wisdom will falter at times—\nhow can such a state be long preserved?*\n\nThe Lord of Song’s Way says:\n*\"Gold and jade filling the halls—this is how one invites his own calamity.\nWealth and noble rank are not the Dao of life and nature.\nExternal things cannot be relied upon as one’s own.\nTreasure gold and jade, and you are burdened by things;\nburdened by things, how can you avoid loss?\nNone can guard them.\nRich and noble yet proud, you harm your virtue.\nHe who harms his virtue—how can he escape misfortune?\nThus it is said: *‘He invites his own calamity.’*\n\nThe Sage does not cling to the gains of a single age as his private possession,\nnor does he take ruling the world as his own display of honor.\nWhat need has he for gold and jade as treasures,\nor for wealth and rank as burdens?\nThus, when wealth is supreme, the state’s resources are exhausted alongside it;\nwhen rank is supreme, the state’s honors are depleted alongside it.\nHis nobility is unmatched, his wealth unparalleled,\nyet the Way remains unshaken.\nWhen achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, he withdraws—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\nWhen achievement is complete, it collapses;\nwhen name is fulfilled, it falters.\nAt high noon, the sun declines;\nwhen the moon is full, it wanes—\nthis is the nature of things.\nThe Sage perceives the signs of rise and decay,\ndiscerns the inevitable cycles of fullness and deficiency,\nand stands apart, unburdened, free from the calamity of pride and excess.\nWho but one who knows Heaven could attain this?\nThus it is said: *‘When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, he withdraws—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.’*\n\nThe revolutions of the four seasons—\nwhen achievement is complete, it departs—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\nTo know advancement but not retreat,\nto know preservation but not ruin,\nto know gain but not loss—\nhow can one avoid regret?\n\nYi Yin said:\n*The minister does not dwell on success through favor and gain.*\nWang Anshi said:\n*Holding fullness to excess cannot be long preserved.*\n\nHe who clings to his vessel’s fullness\nwill easily overturn it.\nHe who sharpens his grasp\ncannot long preserve it.\nHe who sharpens his grasp\ncannot long preserve it.\nGold and jade filling the halls—\nnone can guard them.\nThe halls are empty receptacles for things.\nWhen gold and jade fill them, they are full—\nthus they cannot be guarded.\nRich and noble yet proud—\nhe invites his own calamity.\nGreat wealth and rank do not seek pride,\nyet pride arrives naturally—\nthis is how calamity is invited.\n\nWhen achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, he withdraws—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\nFor the Sage, when achievement is complete and name is fulfilled,\nhe withdraws—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\n\nThe Way of Heaven:\nThe high are humbled, the low are raised.\nIt is also said: *‘Heaven diminishes fullness and benefits the modest.’*\nThe *Book of Documents* says: *‘The modest receive benefit; the proud invite loss.’*\n\nSu Yingbin said:\n*Holding fullness to excess cannot be long preserved.\nKnowing fullness must overflow yet clinging to it—\nit is better not to fill at all.\nKnowing sharpness must blunt yet sharpening it—\nit is better not to sharpen at all.\nAs for the Sage, possessing yet not possessing,\nhow could there be fullness?\nFollowing principle before acting,\nhow could there be sharpness?\nWithout fullness, there is no need to cling;\nwithout excess, there is no need to guard.\nWithout excess, there is no need to sharpen.\n\nGold and jade filling the halls—\nthis is the Way of Heaven when he withdraws.\nThe sun at its

is the ancient virtue of preserving life.\nHow could one covet small gains,\nbe like a greedy wolf,\nseeing benefit yet forgetting the self,\nseeking power yet exhausting it,\nand invite the Dao of peril and annihilation?\"」\n\n「Those who do not understand this are like that of **Zhao Tuo** [晁错], who was ordered to reduce the lands of the feudal lords—his state was not yet prosperous when he met his death; or **Deng Ai** [邓艾], who led the campaign against Eastern Wu—his plans were not yet fulfilled when he died prematurely. All were harmed by their sharpness—how could one not take heed?\n\n**Three: What is not innate cannot be firmly held.**\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.\nThose skilled in seeking the Dao seek within themselves; those skilled in preserving virtue secure what they attain.\nWithout seeking the Dao, there is no foundation for virtue; without establishing virtue, there is no way to manifest the Dao.\nIf one is unsettled here, if one is hasty here, then external things cannot be allowed to enter.\nOnce virtue and the Dao are lost, what one preserves lies outside—grand halls with carved beams and ornate walls, towering eaves and sculpted partitions—unless filled with gold and jade, they cannot be said to be truly refined.\nGold and jade are the essence of pure yang, treasured by the world.\nThose who gain these and consider themselves rich do not follow a lasting path.\nThey can only moisten their homes but not nourish their bodies; they can invite thieves but cannot ensure blessings. Thus, greed for gain becomes a fatal malady, and the pursuit of wealth leads to reckless excess.\nWhat need is there for such transient fortune?\n\n**Four: The virtuous person guards against arrogance.**\nRich and noble yet proud, one invites disaster upon oneself.\nThe *Hong Fan* [《洪范》] lists five blessings: first, longevity; second, wealth—but it never mentions nobility.\nFor wealth can bring nobility, yet nobility does not necessarily bring wealth.\nZhuangzi said: *\"Great wealth brings the nation’s treasures; great nobility brings the nation’s honors.\"*\nIf one can attain wealth, nobility will follow.\nYet even a son of a thousand pieces of gold sits without arrogance—though one may wish not to be proud, how can it be avoided?\nPower compels it thus.\nBut if one, in wealth and nobility, precedes it with propriety, applies it with benevolence, and acts with righteousness, then even wealth and nobility cannot burden virtue.\nThere are those of noble character who surpass this—arrogance harms virtue.\nThose who harm virtue, can they escape misfortune?\nZigong asked: *\"Poor yet without flattery, rich yet without arrogance—how is that?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"That is acceptable.\nBut it is not as good as being poor yet joyful, or rich yet fond of ritual.\"*\n\nThose like the **Fan family**, who suffered humiliation at the hands of **Qiu Kai** [丘开], yet ultimately brought ruin upon themselves, or the **Yu family**, who were injured by a crossbow bolt meant for an assassin because of a rotting rat—these were all those who bore the look of arrogance.\nThus, the later generations withdrew their caution:\n**One: Great names do not endure.**\nWhen achievement is complete and reputation is fulfilled,\nthe Sage, in all matters, thinks deeply.\nWhen holding great things and fearing excess, one fears them as if they were nothing—yet still does not guard against them.\nThus, holding to excess is not as good as ceasing.\nEase is simple; action is difficult.\nAction cannot avoid premeditation, and where premeditation arises, how can one remain unchallenged?\nIf challenged, one seeks victory; if victorious, the other is defeated.\nTo measure and sharpen—is this not a strategy for long preservation?\nTo hold gold and jade without burdening the heart, to dwell in wealth and nobility without arrogance toward others—these are what people find difficult.\nTo have is not as good as to not have; to act is not as good as to cease.\n\n**Two: Align with Heaven and act accordingly.**\nRetreat is the Way of Heaven.\nAt the decline of the sun, without drumming or singing, the aged sigh at misfortune—those who follow Heaven’s path, having achieved their purpose and fulfilled their name, withdraw in retreat.\nThey say, *\"How could this burden me?\"*\n**Shao Ruo** [邵若愚] said: *\"Holding to excess until one retreats is the Way of Heaven.*\nTo dwell in high status and thick profit is like holding a vessel full to the brim—always fearing it will topple, it is better to cease before it overflows.\nThus, the unfilled is easier to hold.\nTo measure and sharpen is to invite ruin.\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.\nWealth and nobility breed arrogance; arrogance and negligence lead to excess—this is not Heaven’s punishment, but self-inflicted ruin.\nYet how does one avoid this calamity?\nThus, the Sage observes the cycles of the four seasons: like spring’s transformation, when achievement is complete and reputation fulfilled, by summer one retreats and does not remain—this is the Way of Heaven.\n**Wang Zhi Ran** [王志然] said: *\"Holding to excess until one retreats is the Way of Heaven.*\nWhat is beyond form is called the Dao; what is within form is called the vessel.\nWithin the realm of vessels, if there is fullness, there must be emptiness; if there is abundance, there must be decline.\nTo hold and guard, one must always fear self-excess—self-excess inevitably brings the disaster of collapse.\nThus, the ancients acted before harm arose and governed before disorder set in, vigilant and cautious, fearing only the loss of the means to reflect and amend.\nThe four cardinal virtues—ritual, righteousness, propriety, and shame—are the constants.\nThey dwell in substance, not in ornament; they always occupy the thick, never the thin.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*The Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and benefits humility;\nThe Dao of Earth transforms excess and flows toward humility;\nGhosts and spirits harm excess and bless humility;\nHuman nature abhors excess and loves humility.*\nHow perfect is humility as virtue!\nIts root lies here; its branches lie there.\nHolding to ancient ways, the Sage has never failed to value humility.\nIts ultimate principle warns against overflow—\nwhat is called *holding to excess is not as good as ceasing.*\nThus, holding excess is not as good as preserving humility;\nmeasuring and sharpening is not as good as blunting sharpness.\nTo measure is to gauge others’ intentions;\nto sharpen is to exploit others’ weaknesses.\nSharpness cannot be beneficial; benefit does not harm others.\nAs Mencius said: *\"The archer fears injuring others; the crossbowman fears not injuring others.\"*\nThis is what should be blunted, not sharpened.\nIf one advances with sharpness, one’s retreat will be swift—\nhow could this endure?\nThis is its meaning.\nExternal things cannot be relied upon—\npeople may claim them as their own, yet the Sage withdraws and avoids them.\nMoreover, wealth and nobility are what people desire,\ngold and jade are what people value—\nif one knows how to accumulate but not how to disperse,\nknows how to take but not how to give,\nthen one is no different from a great thief hoarding treasures.\"*\n\n「Thus there are those who cling to their selfish private gains, insatiable even unto death, neglecting the cultivation of the fundamental Dao of life and death, and instead harming themselves—many perish without realizing it. How utterly foolish they are.\n\nLaozi specifically warns: *\"The more one loves, the greater the cost; the more one hoards, the heavier the loss.\"* Hence, those who understand the Dao recognize that wealth and nobility are ultimately insufficient to preserve one’s life. They do not cling to the transient advantages of a single lifetime for their own private gain, nor do they seek to dominate the world for the sake of display. When wealth accumulates to the point of overflowing the nation’s treasury, when nobility reaches the stage where titles and honors are bestowed upon all, when the distinctions between heaven and earth are blurred and great and small alike are governed by this principle—yet their own person remains untainted by wealth or nobility, their heart tranquil, never slighting even a single thing in their breast, though gold and jade fill their halls, they never grow arrogant or stingy. Their actions align with auspicious fortune, so what blame could there be?\n\nThe affliction of possessing a body is indeed grave. Yet, if one examines and reflects with care, what is truly valued is the absence of blame. When blame is absent, then where do misfortune, regret, and stinginess arise from?\n\nTo know how to advance yet not know how to retreat, to know how to preserve yet not know how to lose, to know how to gain yet not know how to suffer—how could one avoid regret?\n\nIf one achieves fame and success, yet grows proud and self-satisfied, boasting and flaunting, who in the world would not vie to contest their achievements?\n\nThe *Yijing* states: *\"To know how to advance and retreat, preserve and lose, without losing one’s true course—is this not the unique attribute of the Sage?\"*\n\nThe august Heaven has no partiality, only virtue does it assist. The yin and yang of heaven and earth create and transform all things; the four seasons proceed in their order, and the year’s harvest is fulfilled. When the harvest is complete, the season departs—Heaven says nothing of it.\n\nIf humans can embody this, they will harmonize with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with the sun and moon in luminosity, with the four seasons in order, and with the spirits and gods in fortune and misfortune. Heaven will not oppose them, and what of humans?\n\nThus the classics say: *\"When achievements are complete, fame is secured, and one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven.\"* Students of the Way, how could they dare not strive to emulate this?\n\nHuang Maocai remarks: *\"To cling and fill to the utmost is impossible to sustain long.\"* The Dao is without attachment, yet one seeks to make it void. To cling and fill, is this possible? The Dao is without fixed form, yet one seeks to make it rigid. To measure and sharpen, is this possible? All these are rooted in *non*-Dao. Non-Dao is early decay; how could it endure?\n\nEven when gold and jade fill one’s halls, it leads to self-inflicted blame. Gold and jade, as in the saying *\"clad in coarse hemp yet holding jade in one’s bosom,\"* are not of this world’s material wealth. Wealth and nobility, as in the saying *\"those who know me are few, hence I am noble,\"* are not of this world’s transient riches. The ancients had inner attainments; worldly affairs could not perturb their hearts. They valued the inner over the outer, prized themselves above external things.\n\nYet when it comes to arrogance, the disciples of Jian Kang in the Jin Dynasty indulged in lofty discourse, extolling profound mysteries, not without some grasp of the Dao. But by trampling others and scornful of the world, they ultimately met disaster. It is fitting that Laozi warned against this.\n\n*\"When achievements are complete, fame is secured, and one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven.\"* Achievement here means *\"achievement without attachment,\"* not the world’s so-called achievements. Fame here means *\"fame without self-aggrandizement,\"* not the world’s so-called fame. When achievements are complete and fame is secured, yet one withdraws—observing the sequence of the four seasons reveals the Dao of Heaven.\n\nLaozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi, Fan Li, the Four Worthies, Anqi Sheng, and Dongfang Shuo were Sages of the ancient times. Yet the histories do not record their final fate—is this not because the Dao was fulfilled and they withdrew, leaving no trace for mortals to know?\n\nCheng Tai remarked: *\"It is better not to cling and fill at all.\"* Fame, success, wealth, and nobility—when one reaches their utmost measure, this is called *\"filling.\"* Above the point of filling, there is only collapse and overflow. Why strain anxiously to cling and hold, pushing toward the extreme, when it would be better to extinguish such thoughts and leave room for natural overflow? Hence the saying: *\"It is better not to cling and fill at all.\"*\n\nTo measure and sharpen cannot be sustained long. If one fixates on the idea that *\"offices and emoluments are insufficient to fill,\"* then in one’s pursuits, the fear is of ever becoming dull. Thus, one preemptively gauges and calculates; when opportunity is seen, one acts with sharp precision. Those who follow such schemes may indeed succeed. Yet the measuring is in oneself, while the opportunity lies with others; guessing and often hitting the mark is mere luck. Even if one often succeeds by luck, there remain instances where luck fails, and this is the rigid insistence on what cannot be guaranteed. How could one expect such fleeting luck to become a constant? Hence, *\"it cannot be sustained long.\"*\n\nWhen gold and jade fill one’s halls, yet one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven. If wealth is gathered yet cannot be preserved, those who possess it grow proud with their abundance, and pride leads to ruin. Recognizing the cycle of filling and emptying, abandoning fame and success without clinging to them, this is to walk with Heaven. Without pride, one cannot speak of it.\n\nDiscussing the movement of the four seasons, the accomplished withdraw. This is precisely what Laozi meant by the Dao of Heaven. Yet the world hears it as if not hearing. They see the possibility of dwelling in success, yet fail to grasp the true principle of void and fullness.\n\nQijingshuai, the Duke of Qi, lamented the wealth of his state, considering death a tragedy. Yanzi laughed at him: *\"If the ancients never died, then Taigong and Wenzi would always guard it. Would you, my lord, wear a patched robe and till the fields, with no time to ponder death?\"* For they take turns in their roles, take turns in departing, and yet return to the lord. Yet you alone weep—is this not unkind?\n\nIn saying this, he was pointing out the alternating cycles of the four seasons, the successive phases of filling and emptying, and their relation to life and death, gain and loss. Hence, Liezi expounded on the mutual urging of life and transformation, saying: *\"The living cannot avoid living; the transforming cannot avoid transforming.\"* He also spoke of the opposing balance of excess and deficiency: *\"What is lost to one is gained by another; what is gained here is lost there.\"*\n\nThe transforming cannot avoid transforming, for it is the condition of the living’s inability to remain unborn. If this fullness and completion were not drawn from the other, yet the other must inevitably suffer loss and decay—how then could this fullness and completion be sustained without the other’s loss?\n\n「From this perspective, the alternating cycles of departure and return are precisely the teachings of the Old Master [Laozi]. He spoke of those whose accomplishments are complete and whose reputation is fulfilled, yet whose fate demands they must withdraw.\n\nIndeed, accomplishments and fame are the fruits of a profession brought to fruition. Wealth and honor are the gatherings of rank and emolument. Examining the affairs of the world, the number of ranks and emoluments in one age is fixed. Therefore, those who entrust their profession to others must also remain within this same age. If talented and wise individuals were to constantly monopolize these gains, then those who teach and guide with humility would have no place to welcome them.\n\nThus, when new arrivals come, the already accomplished must retreat—this is the inevitable succession of the four seasons. Hence, the Daoists, regarding the world, initially refuse to lightly accept responsibility for others, and ultimately do not wish to long remain in positions of success.\n\nLike the disciples of Zhang Liang [in his retreat to the Garden of Fine Brocade], they could look down upon the calamities and humiliations of Xiao He and Han Xin with a smile, all having perceived this truth.\n\nBut for those who ascend to become sages, the matter is grander still. They say: *\"To harmonize with the virtue/power of Heaven and Earth, to align with the sequence of the four seasons, advancement and retreat, life and death—all proceed without deviation.\"* This is far beyond those who fear fullness and seek safety, for they cannot be compared.\n\nZhan Qiu Pu said: *\"The Dao of holding while full is to withdraw when Heaven demands.\"* The passage of *Yun Yi Zhang* [《运夷章》] elaborates: *\"Yun\"* means \"use,\" *\"Yi\"* means \"balance.\"* To hold until fullness overflows, to grasp until sharpness is extreme—when gold and jade accumulate to fill the hall, when wealth and honor lead to extravagance and arrogance, these are not the paths of balance. They are the roots of calamity and ruin.\n\nTrue balance lies in the passage of *Yun* alone. Therefore, when accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is complete, one must courageously withdraw. This is in accordance with Heaven’s Dao, which is as such. One cannot know advancement without knowing retreat.\n\nZhang Chong replied: *\"The Dao of holding while full is to withdraw when Heaven demands.\"* Just as the sun reaches its zenith and then declines, the moon attains fullness and then wanes, and torrential rain cannot last an entire day—Heaven’s Dao operates thus, and how much more so for humanity?\n\nHumans understand that Heaven’s Dao abhors excess and advocates humility, tempering sharpness and avoiding overreach. Thus, when fullness accumulates within oneself, one must swiftly consider self-restraint. Yet, if one persists in greed for wealth and position, they will invite harm to their spirit and body, bringing ruin upon themselves.\n\nWhen sharpness is directed toward others, one must quickly reflect on tempering it. If they continue to nurture malevolence and harm others, they will provoke retaliation and endanger themselves. To forget fullness and not know restraint is to let gold and jade fill the halls, only to attract disaster—none can guard against it.\n\nWealth and honor leading to arrogance, while harboring sharpness, will only bring self-inflicted blame. If one remains still and unmoving, what blame could there be?\n\nWhen accomplishments are complete and reputation is fulfilled, it is like the moon reaching the center of the sky—then comes the time of cooling winds and rippling waters. The Dao of withdrawing when Heaven demands leaves room for retreat.\n\nLiao Cui Ran said: *\"The Dao of holding while full is to never be self-satisfied. The best course is to let go when it is already complete, to guard oneself with enduring strategy.\"*\n\n*\"The Dao of tempering sharpness is to not indulge in reckless thoughts—one must cut decisively.\"* *\"To not long preserve is to avoid future calamities.\"*\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—\nyet one does not prize external wealth,\nonly cherishing what is self-nourished.\n\nNone can guard it.\nIf one could preserve it,\nwould it not be wondrous?\n\nWealth and honor bring arrogance—\nyet one should not covet extravagance,\nfor splendor comes naturally.\n\nSelf-inflicted blame arises.\nIf I act without contrivance,\nwhat blame could there be?\n\nWhen accomplishments are complete and reputation fulfilled,\none guards oneself with the Dao—\nwater flows to its course naturally,\nyet one must not cling.\n\nWithdrawing in retreat,\nhidden like water in the depths—\nthis aligns with Heaven’s Way.\nEffortlessly, from beginning to end,\none’s household moves without a single step.\n\nChen Bi Xu said:\n*\"To hold while full is not as good as stopping.\nFullness means excess;\nstopping means restraint.\nHe who clutches at what is already overflowing,\nyet knows not humility and self-effacement,\nwill surely see its collapse.\nTo guard against ruin,\nit is better to plan for early cessation.\nThis is a solemn warning.\"*\n\nStrictly speaking, *zhí ér yíng zhī* (积而盈之) refers to hoarding wealth and treasures.\n*\"To temper sharpness is to not long preserve.\n*Describe* (揣) means to measure, also to refine;\n*say* (说) means keen sharpness.\nMen know only the sharpness of greedy desires,\npursuing wealth and honor,\nyet recklessly indulge their passions,\nunmindful of restraint—\ndisaster comes, and it cannot be long sustained.\"*\n\nStrictly speaking, *yán jūn píng* said:\n*\"Wealth and honor to me are like ascending a mountain to gaze afar;\nname and power to me are like a fleeting lightning bolt.\nThis is to say they cannot be long preserved.\"*\n\n*The Hong Lie Explanation* says:\nWhite Gong won Jing State,\nyet could not distribute its treasuries to the people.\nSeven days later, Shi Qi entered and said:\n*\"An unjust gain, yet unable to give—\ncalamity will surely come.\nIf unable to share with others,\nit is better to burn it,\nso none may harm it.\"*\nWhite Gong did not heed this.\nOn the ninth day, Ye Gong entered\nand opened the treasury’s wealth to give to the people,\ndrew arms from the high storehouse to tax the citizens,\nand thus attacked him.\nNineteen days later,\nWhite Gong was captured.\nThe state was not his to possess,\nyet he sought to possess it—\nthis was extreme greed.\nUnable to benefit others,\nyet unable to benefit himself—\nthis was extreme folly.\nWhat difference is there\nbetween White Gong’s stinginess\nand the owl’s love for its young?\nThus it is said:\n*\"To hold while full is not as good as stopping;\nto temper sharpness cannot be long preserved.\"*\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—\nnone can guard it.\nThis proves that excess cannot be reversed;\nit is the inevitable logic of holding fast.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nyet only moisten the house—\nwhen great thieves arrive,\nthey bear away baskets and cases,\nshoulders laden with sacks.\nEven the wise cannot guard them.\nThus, the elephant has tusks yet burns its body,\nthe rooster fears the sacrificial knife and loses its tail.\nEven beasts know this—\nwhy do not men reflect?\n\nWealth and honor bring arrogance,\nself-inflicted blame arises.\n*Her* (遗) means to bestow.\nRiches attract seekers,\nso one easily deceives others.\nHonor makes others submit,\nso one easily oppresses others.\nDeception and oppression grow unchecked—\ncalamity and blame must come.\nWho else could bring it?\n\nStrictly speaking, *yán jūn píng* said:\n*\"Gold and jade to the body,\nname and power to the spirit—\nlike ice and fire,\nthey cannot coexist.\nThus, name is the defilement of the spirit,\nprofit is the harm to the body.\nNurturing the defilement of the spirit,\naccumulating harm to the body—\nit damages what I have achieved,\nyet benefits what I should destroy.\nGaining it is called profit,\nlosing it is called harm—\nthen their thoughts are confused,\nand their inclinations perverse.\"*\n\nAgain he said:\n*\"What benefits my wealth harms my spirit,\nwhat brings me fame destroys my body.\nMisfortune arises from within, not from others;\nblessing arises from within, not from Heaven.\"*\n\nLu Xi Sheng said:\n*\"To hold a great vessel while full—\nthough one fears it, it is better to stop early.\nTo occupy a high position with arrogance—\nthough one worries, it is better to retreat early.\nTo grasp at advantage with sharp intent—\nthough one gains it, it cannot be long preserved.\nTo hoard gold and jade in the hall—\nthough one possesses it, one cannot long guard it.\nNoble while arrogant brings its own ruin,\nrich while arrogant increases its faults.\nArrogance springs from the heart,\nblame arises from oneself.\nHow can one blame Heaven or reproach others?\"*\n\nWhen accomplishments are complete and reputation fulfilled,\nretreat is Heaven’s Way.\nThis concludes the meaning.\n\nWho, when great deeds are done and fame is achieved,\nyet does not know to rest and withdraw?\nMoreover, when fine birds are exhausted,\nthe good bow is hidden;\nwhen the cunning hare is slain,\nthe hunting dog is boiled.\nThis is the way of things.\nOnly those who understand\nHeaven’s Way of fullness and emptiness,\nknowing advance and retreat, survival and ruin—\nthese are the Perfect Ones.\n\nXie Tu Nan said:\n*\"To hold while full cannot be long preserved.\nHow extreme is the thought of fullness—\nnot even a hair’s breadth should take root!\nThe *Yijing* says:\n‘One fullness brings four losses,\none humility brings four gains.’\nThe hearts of Heaven, Earth, man, and ghost\nare thus revealed.*\n\n*Holding* refers to guarding what is within;\n*describing* refers to measuring what is without.\nIf within there is a mind of excess,\none easily becomes arrogant toward others—\nexcess will surely fail,\nso it is better to stop.\nIf without there remains unrefined sharpness,\none easily harms others—\nsharpness will surely break,\nso it cannot long endure.\nThis is why the Sage does not seek greatness,\ndoes not seek height.\"*\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—\nself-inflicted blame arises.\nGold and jade are precious treasures—\nwho does not love them?\nYet if accumulated without dispersal,\nwhat is lost will be much.\nRiches and honor—\nwho does not desire them?\nYet arrogance and contempt for others\nwill make enemies many.\nWho bears the blame?\n\nWhen accomplishments are complete and reputation fulfilled,\nretreat is Heaven’s Way.\nIn this life, to labor without achieving results—\nthe gentleman finds this shameful.\nTo die without a worthy name—\nthe gentleman finds this shameful.\nWhen deeds are done and fame is achieved,\nthen all that can be done is complete.\nTo preserve oneself in retreat,\nknowing when to stop brings no peril—\nHeaven’s Way of transformation unfolds naturally.\n\nThe discussion has been examined: Heaven has the four seasons, and when accomplishments are fulfilled, retreat is called for.\n\nReputation is like the Creator’s stingy bestowal—once achieved and perfected, if one cannot preserve oneself and avoid harm by retiring to leisure, if one is greedy for honor and risks favor, calamity will soon follow.\n\nThis is because one does not understand the principle of *consumption and replenishment*, the Dao of advance and retreat, of flourishing and decline. When *yang* is excessive, regret follows; when *yin* is exhausted, struggle ensues—even the *Heavenly Stem* and *Earthly Branch* cannot escape. How much more so for humanity?\n\nThus, the Yellow Emperor humbled himself before Broad Success’s inquiry, and Zi Zhang followed the wanderings of Chi Song—these are but one Dao.\n\nLin Yongzhai said: *\"To hold and fill to excess until retreat is Heaven’s Way.\"* This chapter speaks only of how advance is not as good as retreat, thus using the metaphor of *holding fullness* and *sharpening to a point*.\n\nA vessel filled to its brim will surely overflow; to hold it is difficult, yet it is easier not to fill it at all. *Already* means \"do not fill to excess.\"\n\n*Describe* (治) means *to govern*; *point* (锐) means *sharpness*. To govern a vessel until it reaches extreme sharpness—nothing can endure without breaking. It is better not to sharpen at all, for then it may endure long.\n\nTo amass wealth until gold and jade fill the hall—one cannot long preserve it. To occupy the rank of a prince and grow arrogant—one will surely invite blame.\n\nThus, those who wish to preserve their accomplishments and safeguard their reputation must know when to retreat, for this is Heaven’s Way. When accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is achieved, it is a matter of their scale—those who can preserve themselves.\n\nHence it is said: *\"fulfilled\"* and *\"achieved.\"* If one does not know when to stop, when is it fulfilled? When is it achieved?\n\nFan Yingyuan said: *\"To hold and fill to excess cannot be long preserved. Fullness leads to overflow; to hold and fortify it is better than not stopping at all. Sharpness leads to fracture; to govern and sharpen it—how can it be long preserved? Gold and jade fill the hall, yet one invites blame by oneself. Greedy for wealth and reckless with life—one loses all while the treasures remain. Rich and noble yet arrogant and extravagant—one loses oneself and brings ruin to one’s descendants.\"*\n\nThe Master of the Riverbank said: *\"When rich, one should rescue the poor; when noble, one should pity the lowly. If instead one grows arrogant and unrestrained, then calamity will follow.\"*\n\nWhen accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is achieved, retreat is Heaven’s Way. The movement of *yin* and *yang* runs its course—when accomplishments are fulfilled, retreat is Heaven’s Way. Humanity should emulate Heaven, so from ancient times to today, those who achieve accomplishments and reputation yet do not retreat are often met with disaster.\n\nThe words of Laozi are a mirror for ten thousand generations. Those like Zi Zhang alone align with Heaven’s Way.\n\nXue Yongzhai said: *\"To hold and fill to excess is not as good as stopping.\"* A vessel filled to its brim will overturn—even if held, it is of no use. It is better to cease what is held and keep it balanced and upright.\n\nTo govern and sharpen to a point cannot be long preserved. A person’s sharp edges, even without grinding, will surely be injured in motion—though governed, they cannot be preserved.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them. Shi Chong, standing in the marketplace, said: *\"My slaves profit from my wealth alone; none can guard it.\"*\n\nRich and noble yet arrogant—one invites blame by oneself. Han Xin, though wise in his many warnings, still demonstrated his power to King Qi, thus inviting the calamity of Yunmeng.\n\nGuo Zhen, after twenty-four promotions to Chancellor, enjoyed wealth, nobility, longevity, and honor from beginning to end—what more could a subject achieve? What blame could there be?\n\nWhen accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is achieved, retreat is Heaven’s Way. Fan Li and Zi Zhang certainly knew this Dao. Did the Grandee Zhen and Li Si understand it?\n\nXiu Xiu An said: *\"To hold and fill to excess until retreat is Heaven’s Way.\"* The wise do not govern fullness or sharpen to a point. Those who guard and wait for satisfaction should know that fullness brings loss—it is better to stop early. Those who govern and sharpen to a point know that sharpness brings fracture—it cannot be long preserved.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them. Time is limited, fleeting and swift; human wealth and nobility are but dreams. Some, when in wealth and nobility, should deeply reflect and awaken, seizing the time to cultivate the Dao and virtue, entering sainthood and transcending humanity. If one is ignorant, indulgent, and extravagant, blind to the Way, one invites blame by oneself.\n\nThose who achieve accomplishments and reputation should early preserve themselves and retreat, gathering results from causes, thus aligning with Heaven’s Way. Those who followed Chi Song’s wanderings—like Zhang Liang.\n\nZhu Bo Xiu said: *\"To hold and fill to excess until retreat is Heaven’s Way.\"* To hold things until they are full is to metaphorically speak of insatiable ambition, thus warning against not stopping. And not to govern and sharpen to a point—to avoid competing for gain and risking harm—thus declaring it cannot be long preserved.\n\nThose who rush in pursuit of gain, reckless in their ambitions, until gold and jade fill the hall—will they not tread the path of *\"wealth without virtue\"*? Those who long dwell in wealth and nobility, without restraint, will grow arrogant and extravagant, corrupting their hearts and ruining their nature. Human and ghostly censure will have no escape—all this begins with excess, with not knowing when to stop.\n\nAccumulating evil and inviting disaster, they end in self-destruction. The affairs of Yi Bu and Jin Gu can serve as a warning. Thus, those who hold should not let things fill to excess—if not filled, there is no need to hold.\n\nThe foolish know this yet take no heed, sweetly stepping into disaster. The gentleman, in this regard, weighs the heavy and light, acting with advance and retreat—not abandoning accomplishments and reputation, but clearly discerning Heaven’s principles of rise and fall, examining human affairs for what is permissible and what is not. Knowing that fulfilled accomplishments and achieved reputation have things to fear, they retreat and conceal themselves to nurture their virtue.\n\nThus, they see the honor of Heaven’s bestowal. Looking back on worldly gains and offices, they find them unworthy of pursuit.\n\nThe cycles of the four seasons run their course—when accomplishments are fulfilled, retreat is called for. If one defies this principle, one disrupts Heaven’s order—how much more so for human affairs?\n\nObserving the ancient and modern heroes, few preserve their later years—worthy of sighs. Only those who perceive omens and know contentment can avoid misfortune in life and leave a fragrant name behind.\n\nThe sages have said: *\"Without the strength to lift mountains or move tides, how could one turn back to see the cold place?\"*\n\n「Truly so. The *Niu Miao* transmission states: *\"To hold and fill is not as good as to know when to stop.\"* By *hold*, it means *admonition*—when what one holds becomes full, it must overflow. Thus, it is seen that it is better to stop before reaching fullness than to hold until overflowing.\n\nTo dwell in *zhongyong* (the balanced middle) is to naturally avoid overflowing. Hence it is said: *\"To know when to stop is better than to hold until full.\"*\n\nIn ancient times, Confucius observed in the temple of Duke Huan of Lu a tilted vessel, and asked its keeper: *\"What is this vessel?\"* The keeper replied: *\"It is called the *yòu* (tolerant) seat vessel.\"* Confucius said: *\"I have heard that the *yòu* seat vessel—when empty, it commands respect; when half-full, it stands upright; when full, it overturns. The ancient wise rulers considered this the ultimate admonition—is this not the meaning of 'to know when to stop is better than to hold until full'?\"*\n\nTo probe and sharpen is not long-lasting. By *probe*, it means *test*; by *sharpen*, it means *unyielding strength*. When one is tested and found to be unyielding, it is certain that they lack *ren* (benevolence). Confucius declared: *\"The unbenevolent cannot long endure adversity, nor can they long dwell in pleasure.\"* This is the same principle.\n\nThe ancients said: *\"To associate with a virtuous person is like walking through mist and dew—though one may not be drenched, there is constant refreshment;\nTo dwell among the wicked is like standing between blades—though one may not be harmed, there is constant peril.*\nMoreover, if one’s attire and bearing are not proper, others may already be inclined to dismiss them—how much more so for the unyielding, whose association cannot be long preserved?\n\nMencius said: *\"When Shun ruled the world, he selected from the masses and raised Gao Yao—then the unbenevolent were distant indeed.\nWhen Tang ruled the world, he selected from the masses and raised Yi Yin—then the unbenevolent were distant indeed.*\nIt is because the unbenevolent know they cannot long endure association. Hence it is said: *\"To probe and sharpen is not long-lasting.\"*\n\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them. Gold and jade are the world’s most precious treasures—though they fill the chamber, they are inherently valued by others, and what benefit do they bring to one’s *shìgōng* (worldly accomplishments)? This is the meaning of *\"none can guard them.\"*\n\nThe *Tàishàng* (Supreme Sage) said: *\"Wealth and honor cannot accompany one at death—when the Five Heavenly Messengers (*Wúcháng Shǐzhě*, the agents of fate) strike without warning, seizing the soul, the grand halls and lofty chambers are no longer inhabited, nor can one follow the swift chariots and fine steeds into the afterlife. Gold and jade, jewels and treasures, are but playthings for others—this is the meaning of 'none can guard them.'*\nWealth and honor bring arrogance, which invites one’s own downfall. Wealth and honor are *zūnróng* (eminence and grace); arrogance is *àomàn* (haughtiness and insolence). *Héi* (to invite) means self-inflicted; *jiù* (blame) means regret and remorse. The ancients said: *\"Does wealth and honor make one arrogant, or does poverty make one arrogant?\"*\nThe proverb states: *\"Wealth and honor do not make one arrogant—if they do, the arrogance comes from within.\"*\nConfucius said: *\"The noble one maintains composure without arrogance; the petty one arrogantly lacks composure.*\nTo fail in dwelling in composure is to invite regret. The *Shū* (Book of Documents) says: *\"Revelry and arrogance lead to ruin—this is to invite disaster oneself.\"*\nDisaster and fortune come from no other source than one’s own actions—this is the meaning of *\"to invite one’s own downfall.\"*\n\nWhen accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation achieved, one must retreat—this is the *Dao* of Heaven. If one stands in the halls of power, their name inscribed on bamboo and silk, they may be said to have fulfilled accomplishments and achieved reputation. Yet if they know to seek retreat, hanging their official cap and refusing further office, this is called *shēntuì* (retiring oneself). Those who retire without overflowing are in accord with Heaven’s *Dao*.\n\nFor instance, Zhang Liang served Emperor Gaozu of Han, ranked among the feudal lords, yet he did not dare accept three thousand households—only saying: *\"A seal and a title are enough.\"* Later, he left office and wandered with the *Chìsōng Zǐ* (Red Pine Immortal). Was this not retiring oneself?\nFan Li served King Goujian of Yue and achieved hegemony, then said: *\"Under a great name, one cannot long remain.\"* He removed his official seal, set sail across the sea, and departed. These two men—fulfilling accomplishments without claiming them, achieving reputation and retiring—embodied the *Dao* of Heaven’s non-overflowing principle, were they not virtuous?\n\nYang Zhiren said: *\"From 'to hold and fill' to 'retiring oneself' is the *Dao* of Heaven. To hold and fill means the sun reaches its peak at nine in the third month, while the moon wanes at two in the eighth month. In *xiūzhēn xuédào* (cultivating true *Dao*), lead and mercury transform into the most precious elixir—when the fire’s *huò* (alchemical potency) is complete and the *qi* is sufficient, one must retreat and not act further. If they fail to know when to stop, great disgrace will follow. Hence, 'to know when to stop is better than to hold until full.'*\nIt is because holding until full leads to overflowing—better to stop before that. Yet if one has not yet reached fullness, there must be greed. To probe and sharpen—how can this be long preserved?\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them. Wealth and honor bring one to retire and conceal—this is to harmonize with Heaven’s *Dao*.\n\nShu Guang said to his son: *\"I have heard that knowing contentment brings no disgrace, knowing when to stop avoids peril. When accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation achieved, this is the way—if one does not leave, fear will come with regret. Yet arrogance and indulgence in desires will surely harm one’s *shénqì* (spirit and *qi*), inviting one’s own downfall.\"*\n\nWhen accomplishments are fulfilled without boasting, and reputation achieved without flaunting, the *Dao* is complete.\n\nQing Zhong said: *\"From 'to hold and fill' to 'retiring oneself' is the *Dao* of Heaven. Fullness invites loss; modesty invites benefit. This is the *Dao* of Heaven, the essence of this chapter’s teaching.*\nA vessel full to the brim will overturn—none hold it better than knowing when to stop.\nA blade too sharp will break—if one further probes and grinds it, it cannot be long preserved.\nUsing objects as metaphors, it is to teach people to know when to advance and when to retreat.\nGold and jade fill the hall—one should stop there. Yet if they greedily seek more, though they possess this gold and jade, none can guard it.\nWealth and honor that permeate the heavens should prompt one to know when to stop. Yet if they further indulge in arrogance and self-indulgence, this is to invite one’s own downfall.»\n\nThe sun at its zenith must decline,\nthe moon at full must wane—\nHeaven and Earth in fullness and emptiness\nfollow the ebb and flow of time.\nWhen merit is complete and name is fulfilled,\none who knows to retreat—\nis this not in accord with the natural *Dao* of Heaven?\n\nFan Li conquered Yue yet sailed away in a humble boat upon the Five Lakes,\nLu Zhonglian declined the thousand-gold reward at Liaocheng,\nrejected the emperor’s title and fled the noble seals of Qin.\nZhang Zifang, though he humbled the tyrant Xiang Yu,\nthen drifted away to wander with the immortal Zhongshan.\nAll surpassed the figures of Qin and Han in grandeur—\nthese were those whose merit was complete yet who did not cling to it.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"The virtuous one perceives the signs and acts—\nwaiting until the day is done is too late.\"*\n\nThe *Shiliu Xu* says:\n*\"To hold and fill is not as good as stopping.\nAll things under Heaven, when grasped and pushed to their fullest,\nwill inevitably invite ruin—\nthus it is urged: ‘Better to stop early.’\n‘Stop’ means ‘halt.’\nIt means: better to halt in good time.\"*\n\nPower and influence are even more so.\nTo sharpen and probe it—\nit cannot be long preserved.\n\nThe *Dao* is sought and found,\nabandoned and lost—\nthis seeking is beneficial to what is obtained,\nfor the seeking lies within oneself.\nYet now, when one’s mind schemes and sharpens ambition,\neven if one gains what is desired,\nit is far removed from the virtue of *Dao*, *de*, and *renyi*.\nHow could it be long preserved? Is this not fitting?\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—\nnone can guard it.\nGold and jade are the supreme treasures of Heaven and Earth,\nloved by all under Heaven—\nthough piled high in a grand hall,\nthose whose greedy hearts are never satisfied\ntruly cannot guard them.\nIs this not the way of great thieves accumulating wealth?\n\nRiches and honor bring arrogance—\none invites one’s own ruin.\nThe lords and kings, the most exalted in wealth and honor,\nif they govern themselves with humility,\nshall long enjoy Heaven’s blessings.\nBut if they lord it over the world with pride,\nthey bring ruin upon themselves—\nwho else is to blame?\n\nWhen merit is complete and name is fulfilled,\none retreats—\nthis is the *Dao* of Heaven.\nMerit and fame are the weightiest concerns of sages past and present.\nOnly when they are complete and fulfilled does one know to retreat,\nthus preserving them—\nthis is the duty of those with great virtue.\nHow could it be the concern of petty wisdom?\n\nThus it is said: *\"To hold and fill is the *Dao* of Heaven.\"*\nThe cycles of the four seasons,\nthe completion of merit—\nthis is the *Dao* of Heaven.\nIt is because the four seasons cannot but succeed one another.\nThis chapter’s true intent in *Laozi* is:\nwhen merit is complete and fame is fulfilled,\nto retreat early—\nemphasizing that fullness must overflow,\nsharpness must break.\n\nA vessel full yet grasped—\nbetter to halt and not cling.\nA blade sharpened and probed—\nit cannot be preserved long unbroken.\n*\"Probe\"* means to sharpen it further.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—\nthey invite robbers and cannot be guarded.\nRiches and honor bring arrogance—\nruin and blame inevitably follow—\nthis is the natural order.\n\n*Laozi* spoke thus,\ndesiring that people know contentment to avoid disgrace,\nknowing when to stop to avoid peril.\n\nIn this world, people seek nothing but merit and fame.\nWhen merit is achieved and name is fulfilled,\none should retreat—\nfor Heaven abhors fullness and favors humility.\nOtherwise, clinging to fullness, sharpening ambition,\narrogance in riches and honor,\nunknowing of contentment—\ndisgrace and peril will surely follow.\n\nThe *Yuan’an Resident* says:\n*\"To hold and fill is the *Dao* of Heaven.\"*\nFullness must overflow,\nsharpness must break.\nTo fear overflow and forcefully grasp it—\nbetter not to be full in the first place,\nso there is no need to grasp.\nTo fear breaking and probe it with one’s hands—\nbetter not to be sharp in the first place,\nso there is no need to probe.\n\n‘Fullness’ refers to power and status,\n‘sharpness’ to talent and wisdom.\nGold and jade fill the hall—\nthis refers to talent and wisdom.\nRiches and honor bring arrogance—\nthis refers to power and status.\nMerit complete—power and status.\nFame fulfilled—talent and wisdom.\n\nGold and jade are objects of joy and admiration—\neven storing them in a room is hard to guard,\nlet alone in a hall?\nEven the hall is unsafe—\nhow much more so when it is full?\nThus, though one might watch with the keen eyes of Li Zhu\nand defend with the strength of Bi Yu,\nthieves would still seize them.\nThis illustrates how those who boast of talent and wisdom,\nflaunting their fullness,\nwill inevitably be undone by external forces.\nThis is why great fame is hard to sustain.\n\nRiches and honor are easy to lose and hard to secure—\neven humility and retreat cannot guarantee safety,\nlet alone adding arrogance and excess?\nThis ruin is not wrought by Heaven,\nnor does misfortune come from without—\nall is self-inflicted.\n\nThis is why great merit is hard to preserve.\nOnly the wise, when merit is complete and fame is fulfilled,\nretreat—\nthus aligning with the *Dao* of Heaven.\n\n\"Retreat\" carries two meanings:\nin terms of power and status, it is *guitian* (withdrawal);\nin terms of talent and wisdom, it is *qianxu* (humble retreat).\nThe *Dao* of Heaven is as the *Yijing* speaks of *xu-ying-yi-qian*,\nand the commentaries say of the four seasons’ cycles—\nthose who achieve merit must retreat.\n\nThe people of Jin said of Lin Gong:\n*\"He can be said to have gold and jade filling his hall,\"*\nalso referring to talent and wisdom.\nThe world interprets this as guarding wealth—\nhow shallow!\n\nThe Sage of Later Chapters, clad in coarse hemp yet harboring jade within—\ncould this truly be jade?\n\n*《Zhuzizi Pangzheng》* records:\n*《Wenzi》* states: \"The Master Lao said:\nIf acquired through unrighteousness,\nand not shared through generosity,\nthen calamity will befall oneself,\nand one cannot be called a true person.\nNor can one differ from the owl that loves its young.\nThus, to hold and hoard it,\nis not as good as letting it go.\nTo clutch and sharpen it,\ncannot be long preserved.\n\nShi Tan said:\nTo hold and fill oneself with it,\nis not as good as letting it go.\nTo clutch and sharpen it,\ncannot be long preserved.\nGold and jade filling one’s hall,\nnone can guard it.\nRich and noble yet arrogant,\none invites one’s own ruin.\n\nWhen merit is complete and fame is fulfilled,\nretreat while still alive—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\nTo cling and be self-satisfied,\nis not as good as stopping.\nTo clutch and polish with sharp edges,\ncannot be long preserved.\nGold and jade filling one’s hall,\nmay depart at its appointed time,\nand cannot be considered as something to be long guarded.\nRich and noble yet arrogant,\none invites one’s own ruin.\n\nHigh position brings slander,\nwealth invites thieves’ eyes.\nThus, when merit is complete and fame is fulfilled,\none must first retreat in person,\nthen can avoid ruin.\nFor the full will surely be diminished,\nthe spent will surely be exhausted—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe *《Yijing》*’s *《Qian》* (Modesty) says:\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the full and benefits the modest,\nthe Dao of Earth transforms the full and flows into modesty,\nthe Dao of spirits harms the full and blesses the modest,\nthe Dao of humanity abhors the full and favors modesty.\n*《Shu》* (Book of Documents) says:\n‘The full invites loss, the modest invites benefit—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven and time.’\n\nThis aligns with the meaning of this chapter.\nThe earlier scholars said:\n‘The Master Lao truly grasped the *《Yijing》*’s Modesty—\nthis is certain.’\n\n*《Daode Zhengjing Jiyi》* Volume Fourteen concludes.\n#1: The flaws of the feudal lords are severe—\naccording to *《Zuofu》*, \"flaws\" (*弊*) should be \"wealth\" (*币*).\nSame below.\n#2:

reveals the profound and mysterious *virtue/power* (德) of the *Commentary* (注).\n\nZhang Chongying (张冲应) responds:\nThe fifth chapter already expounds on the gate of *vital essence* (精气) entering and

*hun* (魂) and *po* (魄).\nHumans rely on the *hun* (魂) and *po* (魄) to sustain life,\nand must cherish and nourish them.\nExcessive joy or anger disturbs the *hun* (魂),\nwhile sudden fright harms the *po* (魄).\nThe *hun* (魂) resides in the liver,\nthe *po* (魄) in the lungs.\nFine wine and rich meats corrupt the liver and lungs,\nso when the *hun* (魂) is tranquil and aligned with the Dao,\nthe *po* (魄) will be secure, extending one’s lifespan and years.\n\n*Embracing the One can remain steadfast without separation* (抱一能无离):\nIf one can *embrace the One* (抱一),\nensuring it does not depart from

Softness* (专气致柔):\nIf one guards *qi* (精气) with unwavering focus,\npreventing its disorder,\nthen the body can respond with gentle compliance.\n\n*Can one be as pure as an infant?* (能婴儿):\nCan one be like an infant—\ninternally free from scheming,\nexternally free from governance—\nso that *vital essence* (精) does not dissipate?\n\n*Purifying Elimination and Mysterious Observation* (涤除玄览):\nOne should purify the mind,\nmaking it pristine and clear.\nThe mind dwells in the deepest mystery,\nobserving all things with knowing insight—\nthus it is called *Mysterious Observation* (玄览).\n\n*Can one be without blemish?* (能无疵):\nCan one avoid licentiousness and impurity,\nso that purity can be without flaw or disease?\n\n*Loving Others and Governing the Realm* (爱民治国):\nFor bodily cultivation, loving *qi* (气) ensures wholeness;\nfor governing the realm, loving the people ensures stability.\n\n*Can one act without interference?* (能无为):\nIn bodily cultivation, one breathes *qi* (精气) without letting it be heard;\nin governing the realm, one dispenses benevolence without letting it be known below.\n\n*The Celestial Gate Opens and Shuts* (天门开阖):\n*The Celestial Gate* refers to the *Purple Forbidden Enclosure* (北极紫微宫).\n*Opening and shutting* refers to the cyclical transitions of the five phases.\nIn bodily cultivation, *the Celestial Gate* signifies the nostrils—\n*opening* means inhaling,\n*shutting* means exhaling.\n\n*Can one transcend duality?* (能无雌):\nIn bodily cultivation, one should be like the feminine—\ntranquil, still, and yielding.\nIn governing the realm, one adapts to changes,\nharmonizing without discord.\n\n*Clarity and Fourfold Reach* (明白四达):\nOne’s vision and hearing are as luminous as the sun and moon,\nreaching all four directions beyond the eight extremes of the world.\nThus it is said:\n*It is unseen when observed,\nunheard when listened to—\nits brilliance spreads to all ten directions,*\n*shining resplendently and gloriously.*\n\n*Can one be without knowing?* (能无知):\nNone can fully know the Dao’s fulfillment across all under Heaven.\n\n*Generating and Nurturing* (生之畜之):\nThe Dao generates all things and nourishes them.\n*Generating without possession* (生而不有):\nThe Dao generates all things without claiming ownership.\n*Acting without reliance* (为而不恃):\nThe Dao’s actions are not done in expectation of reward.\n*Nurturing without domination* (长而不宰):\nThe Dao nurtures all things without forcing them into service.\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue/Power* (玄德).\n\nIt is said:\nThe Dao’s practice of *virtue/power* (德) is mysterious and unfathomable,\nyet it seeks to make this known to people.\n\nWang Fusi (王辅嗣) states:\n*Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One*—\ncan one remain steadfast without separation?\n*Zai* (载) means *dwelling* (处).\n*The Vital Essence* (营魄) is where humans naturally reside.\n*The One* (一) is the true nature of humanity.\nIf one can dwell in the ordinary abode of humanity,\nembrace the pure spirit of *The One*,\nand remain steadfast without separation,\nthen all things will naturally submit.\n\n*Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness*—\ncan one be as pure as an infant?\n*Specialized* (专) means *committed to* (任).\n*Attain* (致) means *to the utmost* (极).\nIf one commits to the natural *qi* (气),\nreaching the utmost harmony of softness,\ncan one be like an infant with no desires?\nThen all things will be whole and one’s nature attained.\n\nLove the people and govern the state—\ncan one act without action?\n\nTo employ techniques and seek achievement,\nto manipulate fate and seek concealment—\nthis is cleverness.\n\nTo gaze deeply without blemish,\nis like abandoning the Sage.\n\nTo govern the state without cleverness\nis to discard cleverness.\nCan one refrain from cleverness?\nThen the people will not flee,\nand the state will govern itself.\n\nThe Celestial Gate opening and closing—\ncan one act as the receptive?\n\nThe Celestial Gate—\nby which the world comes to be.\nOpening and closing—\nthe juncture of order and chaos.\nSometimes opening, sometimes closing,\nits course flows through all under Heaven—\nthus it is called the Celestial Gate’s opening and closing.\n\nReceptive yet not leading,\nfollowing yet not acting.\nIf the Celestial Gate’s opening and closing\ncan act as the receptive,\nthen all things will submit,\nand one’s dwelling will be at ease.\n\nClarity and omniscience—\ncan one act without knowing?\n\nIf one is utterly clear and all-pervading,\nwithout confusion or doubt,\ncan one refrain from action?\nThen all things will transform.\n\nThe Dao is ever without action.\nIf lords and kings can uphold it,\nthen all things will submit.\n\nTo nurture life without blocking its source,\nto raise without restraining its nature—\nthis is called *Xuan* virtue.\n\nNot blocking its source, yet things grow of themselves—\nwhat merit is there?\nNot restraining its nature, yet things thrive on their own—\nwhat labor is relied upon?\nThings grow fully on their own,\nnot shaped by me—\nvirtue exists, yet no master—\nwhat is this if not *Xuan*?\n\nAll talk of *Xuan* virtue\nis virtue without knowing its master,\nemerging from the profound darkness.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\n*Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One*—\ncan one remain steadfast without separation?\n\nWhen humans first transform, it is called *po* (魄).\nOnce born, *po* becomes *hun* (魂) with the sun.\n*Po* is yin and hollow,\n*hun* is yang and full.\nTo dwell in the hollow *po*,\none must constantly nurture and restore the yang—\nwhen yang *qi* is full, it becomes *hun*,\nand *hun* in motion brings life’s completion.\n\n*The One*—\nunmixed.\nRestoring yang completes life,\nuntainted and pure.\nThus, to embrace and guard the pristine *One*,\ncan one remain inseparable from the body?\n\n*Commentary*:\n*Load* (载) means *beginning*.\n*Ying* (营) means *nurture*.\n\nThe birth of humanity begins with transformation,\nyet only a hollow form exists.\nOnce *po* emerges, yang *qi* fills the hollow *po*,\nand when *po* moves, it is called *hun*—\nlike the moon’s shadow reflecting the sun’s light.\n\nThus, Confucius’ disciple Zǐchán said in *The Spring and Autumn Annals*:\n“When humans first transform, it is called *po*;\nonce born, *po* becomes *hun* with the sun.”\nSpeaking of humans bearing the hollow *po*,\none must nurture and guard the yang *qi*,\nconstantly ensuring its fullness—\nthen life is complete.\n\nIf movement and use are not steadfast,\nyang *qi* scatters, returning to hollow *po*,\nand death ensues.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n“Do not let the near-dead revive their yang.”\nThus, one must nurture and guard the hollow *po*,\nrestoring yang to achieve full life.\n\nEmbrace and guard the pure *One*,\nuntainted by mixture—\ncan one remain inseparable from the body?\nThen life is complete.\n\nThis is the teaching of nurturing the spirit.\n\nCan one focus the *qi* to attain softness,\nlike an infant?\nFocus the unified, harmonious *qi*,\nbringing it to gentle equilibrium—\ncan one be like a newborn, undifferentiated?\n\n*Commentary*:\n*Focus* means *unified*.\n*Qi* refers to the subtle, harmonious *qi*.\nHuman birth originates from this harmonious essence.\nIf defiled by worldly attachments,\nthe harmonious *qi* disperses,\nand the spirit fails to sustain the body.\nThus, one must focus on the unified, harmonious *qi*,\nattaining gentleness like an infant,\nunattached to anything.\n\nThis is the teaching of nurturing the *qi*.\n\nCan one purify and refine *Xuan* perception,\nfree of blemish?\n*Xuan* perception—\nthe mind’s illumination.\n*Blemish*—\nflaws and afflictions.\nWash and refine the mind’s illumination,\nmaking it clear and pure—\ncan one be free of flaws?\n\n*Commentary*:\n*Purify*—to cleanse.\n*Refine*—to regulate.\n*Xuan* perception—the mind’s illumination.\n*Blemish*—affliction.\nHuman attachments arise from desire.\nOne must cleanse and regulate,\nmaking the mind’s illumination clear and pure,\nso desire does not arise—\ncan one be free of affliction?\n\nThis is the teaching of cultivating the mind.\n\nCan one govern the people and rule the state\nwithout action?\nNurturing the myriad people,\nadministering state affairs—\ncan one act without interference?\nThen transformation will be self-wrought.\n\nTeaching begins with nurturing the *po*—\nall instruction is for self-cultivation.\nWhen the self is cultivated, virtue is complete,\nand one may become a ruler.\n\n*Commentary*:\nTo love the people is to prevent sudden violence,\nto labor without harming their nature.\nTo govern the state is to prioritize agriculture,\nvaluing grain, simplifying duties—\nthen the people will find peace in life,\ntransformed without words.\n\nThis is *wuwei*.\n\nCan one do this?\n\nThe Heavenly Gate opens and shuts—\ncan one remain receptive?\n\nThe Heavenly Gate is where the Mandate of Heaven issues forth.\nOpening and shutting refer to order and chaos—\nwhen the sovereign receives the Mandate in due time,\nif one remains receptive and still,\nthen one may long endure the Heavenly Blessing.\n\nAnother interpretation:\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n\"One opening, one shutting—this is called transformation.\"\nThe Sage governs the Dao, responding to change without rigidity,\nnot fixating on dominance but embracing receptivity—\nlike the Heavenly Gate’s opening and shutting,\nyielding when full and humbling when diminished.\n\n*Commentary:*\nTo cultivate virtue and become a ruler—\nthough one receives the Mandate of Heaven (the Heavenly Gate),\nthe sovereign’s Mandate originates from Heaven.\nOpening means receiving the Mandate,\nshutting means abdication.\nHeaven bestows the precious Mandate upon the virtuous—\nif one remains receptive and yielding,\none may enjoy supreme blessing.\n\nThus it is asked: Can one remain receptive?\n\nIlluminated and far-reaching—\ncan one remain unknowing?\n\nIf the sovereign remains receptive and still,\nthe myriad people joyfully extol their virtue,\nilluminated like the sun’s fourfold radiance—\nyet though forgotten, they do not rule.\nThus it is asked: Can one remain unknowing?\n\n*Commentary:*\nOnce the sovereign receives the Mandate and governs all under Heaven,\nif they remain receptive and still,\ntheir virtue shines like the sun’s illumination,\nreaching all under Heaven.\nTheir influence extends to all things,\nyet they do not claim it as their own—\nthis is called \"forgetting merit as if unknowing.\"\n\nThus it is asked: Can one remain unknowing?\n\nNurture and sustain life.\n\n*Commentary:*\nThe lower text says: *The Way gives birth, virtue nurtures.*\nHere it says \"nurture and sustain\"—\nthe sovereign follows the pure Way,\nallowing all things to fulfill their natural growth,\nand through virtue, broadly aids them,\nso each may fully realize their sustenance.\n\nThus: \"Nurture and sustain.\"\nTo give birth yet not possess—\nthis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nTo allow all things to fulfill their growth,\nyet not claim it as one’s own—\nto act yet not rely on merit,\nto lead yet not rule—\nif the sovereign can do this,\nthis is called the profound Mysterious Virtue.\n\n*Commentary:*\nThings fulfill their growth—\nthe Sage forgets their deeds.\nGrowth is naturally sufficient,\nforgetting merit ensures its permanence.\nThis is to achieve the private through the impersonal,\nto rule without ruling.\n\nThus: \"To give birth yet not possess\"—\nto allow all things to fulfill their growth,\nthe sovereign does not claim it as their own.\n\"To act yet not rely\"—\nto allow all things to move freely,\nacting without arrogance,\nnot attributing deeds to oneself.\n\"To lead yet not rule\"—\nstanding above the myriad people,\nthus called \"lead.\"\nNot relying on merit,\nthus called \"not rule.\"\n\nSo this is called the profound Mysterious Virtue.\n\nDu Guangting says:\nCarrying the *po* and embracing Oneness—\ncan one remain undivided?\n\n*Carrying*—the *po* bears it.\nThe human body is where spirit and *qi* reside,\nwhere soul and *po* dwell.\nThe body moves like a carriage bearing objects.\n*The Western Ascension Scripture* says:\n\"The body is the spirit’s carriage.\"\nSince it is likened to a carriage,\nit must bear and move.\n\nThe *po* is empty and substantial—\nthe form of *yin* *qi*, the human shape.\nThe spirit is formless *yang* *qi*—the human essence.\nIf form is present yet *yang* *qi* has not descended,\none is inert, like a lifeless stone or withered tree.\nWhen *yang* *qi* descends, movement becomes possible.\nThus, form is called *po* (belonging to *yin*),\nand spirit is called soul (belonging to *yang*).\n\nAs long as there remains even a thread of *yang* *qi*,\none does not die.\nAs long as there remains even a thread of *yin* *qi*,\none does not become immortal.\nThus, refining *yin* *qi* to exhaustion grants transcendence to the Nine Heavens—\nimmortality is the companion of *yang*.\nRefining *yang* *qi* to exhaustion plunges one into the Nine Abysses—\nthe ghostly state is the companion of *yin*.\n\nTherefore, one must preserve the *yang* soul\nand nurture the *yin* *po*\nto preserve life entirely.\n\n*Embracing Oneness*—this is guarding the Dao.\nRestraining the soul and governing the *po*,\nthe foundation is guarding the Dao.\nTo command one to guard the Dao,\nrestraining and governing—\ncan one remain undivided?\n\nThe empty form—\nwhen substance first takes shape, it is called *xiàng* (image).\n*Xiàng* means resemblance.\nLike the moon’s arc reflecting the sun’s light—\n*The Heavenly Primordium Scripture* says:\n\"The moon is *yin* *qi*, having form yet no light.\"\nThe sun is the essence of the Great Yang,\nconstantly following the Yellow Path eastward.\nIn one day and night, it travels one degree and more—\none degree equals 2,932.32 *li*.\nThe moon is the essence of Great *Yin*,\nits shape round, its essence pure.\nIt borrows the sun’s light to reveal its body—\nwhere the sun does not shine, it is called the *po*.\nIt constantly follows the Yellow Path eastward,\nsometimes deviating above or below it.\nIts speed varies—\nat its slowest, it travels 12°19'2\" per day,\naveraging 13°37',\nat its fastest, 14°9'13\"—\nslowing when swift, swift when slow.\nIn 27 days and 52/81 parts of a day,\nthe sun travels 417/81 parts of a degree—\nthis is the end of its slow and fast phases.\nThen it begins anew.\nEach month at the new moon, it aligns with the sun—\nthis is called *hézè* (conjunction).\nWhen the moon moves swiftly and the sun slowly,\nafter three days, the *po* appears.\nBeyond three days, its light gradually grows.\nOn the first quarter, the sun shines on its side,\nso from Earth, one sees it partially illuminated.\nAt the full moon, the sun and moon face each other,\nEarth lies between them,\nso its form is round and its light full.\nWhen the full moon appears in the east at dawn,\nthis is called *cè* (lateral)—\nit moves slowly.\nWhen the new moon appears in the west at dusk,\nthis is called *xiǎo* (dawn)—\nit moves swiftly.\n\n*The Heavenly Response* says:\nIts light is void like the sun’s—\nwhen the sun’s light is not extreme, it is called *ànxū* (dark emptiness).\nWhen *ànxū* aligns with the moon, there is a lunar eclipse;\nwhen it aligns with a star, the star vanishes.\nWhen the sun and moon are at new or full phase\nand travel the central path,\nthey align with *ànxū* and are eclipsed.\nThe sun and moon each span three thousand *li* in circumference,\nwith a diameter of one thousand *li*.\n\n「When a person first transforms, they are called *pò* (embryo of the spirit).\n\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Zhao of the State of Lu (7th year of his reign) records:\nAt first, the Lord of Zheng (郑伯) had a policy, but was killed by Si Dai (驷带).\nThe Zheng people were alarmed and said: *\"The Lord of Zheng has come!\"*\nSome dreamed of the Lord of Zheng, who declared:\n*\"On the day *rénzǐ* (壬子), I will kill Si Dai.\"*\nThe next year, Si Dai was killed.\nThe year after that, Gong Sun Duan (公孙段) was killed.\nThe Zheng people grew even more fearful.\nSome asked Zi Chan (子产):\n*\"Can the Lord of Zheng still act as a vengeful ghost?\"*\nZi Chan replied:\n*\"When a person is born, their shadow is called *pò* (embryo of the spirit), and their luminous essence is called *hún* (spirit-soul).\nIf one’s vitality is strong, then their *hún* and *pò* are powerful.\nEven ordinary men and women, if they die violently, can still cling to the living and bring calamity and evil influence (*yínlì*—淫厉).\nHow much more so the Lord of Zheng, who held political power for three generations—\nhis spirit was strong, and he could still act as a vengeful ghost.\nThis is why he was called the Lord of Zheng:\nHe was a descendant of Duke Mu of Zheng (穆公), the grandson of Zi Liang (子良), and the son of Zi Er (子耳).\nThus, it is said that he held power for three generations.\nZi Chan then established Zi Liang Zhi (子良止) to appease him, and the disturbances ceased.*\n\n*\"The mind at death, preventing it from returning to vitality\"*—\nthis is the phrase from the *Zhuangzi’s* \"齐物篇\" (齐物 *Qíwù*—\"Equalizing Things\").\nBecause of his suffering and misfortune, his lingering spirit was bound by determination and could still act as a vengeful ghost.\nThis is like Nan Guo Zi Qi (南郭子綦) answering Zi You (子游) on the meaning of *Tiān Lài* (天籁—the \"Heavenly Response\").\n\n*Purity and unity (*chúnyī*—淳一), without separation (*bùlí*—不离)—*\nthis means harmonizing and refining, removing impurities and stopping chaos, so that nothing is mixed.\nThe *Laozi* (老君) understood this principle of nurturing the *pò* (embryo of the spirit) and maintaining unity,\nand thus taught people how to cultivate their *shén* (神—spirit).\n\nThe *Shàngqīng Yǐnshū* (上清隐书—\"Hidden Scriptures of the High Clarity\") speaks of the methods of *Yùyí Bēnrì* (郁仪奔日) and *Jiélié Bēnyuè* (结璘奔月)—\nthe *Dao* (Way) of chasing the sun and moon.\nIt states that within the sun and moon, there dwell five *Dì* (帝—Celestial Sovereigns).\nBy calling upon the taboos within the sun and moon,\nand visualizing the forms and attire of the five *Dì*,\nthey descend to bestow upon you their blessings.\nThus, you absorb the radiance of the sun and moon,\nand those who practice this method can live as long as the sun and moon themselves.\n\nIt also speaks of the method of *Jūhún Zhìpò* (拘魂制魄)—\ncontrolling the spirit-soul (*hún*) and restraining the embryo of the spirit (*pò*).\nOn the 3rd, 13th, and 23rd days of the lunar month,\none focuses on the transformation of the red *qi* (赤气) within the mind,\nand invokes the names of the three *hún* (三魂):\n*Tāiguāng* (胎光—\"Fetal Light\"), *Shuǎnglíng* (爽灵—\"Vigorous Spirit\"), and *Yōuxīng* (幽精—\"Mysterious Essence\").\nThen, through secret incantations (*mìzhòu*—密咒), one binds the spirit-soul (*jūhún*—拘魂).\nOn the new moon, full moon, and waning days,\none focuses on the transformation of the white *qi* (白气) at the tip of the nose,\nand invokes the names of the seven *pò* (七魄):\n*Shīgǒu* (尸狗—\"Corpse Dog\"), *Fúshǐ* (伏矢—\"Hidden Arrow\"), *Qiǎoyīn* (雀阴—\"Sparrow Shadow\"), *Tūnyé* (吞贼—\"Devouring Thief\"), *Chúhuì* (除秽—\"Removing Filth\"), *Chòufèi* (臭肺—\"Foul Lung\"), and *Fěidú* (非毒—\"Non-Venom\").\nThen, through secret incantations (*mìzhòu*—密咒), one restrains the embryo of the spirit (*zhìpò*—制魄).\nEach has its own method of concentration and incantation,\nas detailed in the *Shàngqīng Pǐnzhōng* (上清品中—\"High Clarity Canon\").\nPracticed diligently over time, this can enable one to move effortlessly (*qīngjǔ*—轻举).\n\nThis is the *Tàishàng* (太上—\"Supreme Venerable\")’s method of nurturing and protecting the ethereal embryo of the spirit (*yūpò*—虚魄),\nand transcending the world to achieve longevity (*dùshì chángshēng*—度世长生).\n\nCan one concentrate their *qi* to achieve such softness (*zhìróu*—致柔) as a baby?\nA baby does not yet know, and yet answers questions with ease.\nThey are entirely devoted to the pure and harmonious *qi*,\nuntainted by external influences and free from internal thoughts and worries.\nTheir nature follows the softness of *qi*, so their pure and harmonious *qi* does not disperse.\n\nThose who guard the *Dao* should be like babies—\nfree from external defilements and internal thoughts,\nso that their spirit does not leave their body.\n\nThe *Xīshēng Jīng* (西升经—\"Scripture of the Rising in the West\") says:\n*\"It is better to pity oneself than to pity others,\nbetter to love oneself than to love the spirit,\nbetter to contain the spirit than to love it,\nand better to guard the True than to contain the spirit.\nGuarding the True ensures lasting existence.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"The spirit loves the body, but the body does not love the spirit.\nThus, the *Laozi* teaches people to nurture the spirit and *qi*.\"*\n\nCan one purify and refine (*xǐchú xuànlǎn*—涤除玄览) to avoid flaws?\nThe mind’s illumination (*zhīnguāng*—心之照) penetrates all existence and non-existence,\nspanning the heavens and earth.\nIt responds to circumstances immediately and moves with the environment.\nIf one does not regulate it with clarity and purity (*chéngjìng*—澄浄),\nthen it will be entangled by desires and sink into defilements (*dònglún rǎn yù*—动沦染欲).\nOnce entangled by desires, all evils arise (*wàn’è shēng*—万恶生).\nWhen all evils arise, diseases and calamities follow (*bìbìng zuò*—庇病作).\nThe *Laozi* warns against this:\nRefine and purify the mind, cutting away desires (*jiǎnqù yùxīn*—翦去欲心).\nWhen the mind’s illumination is clear and pure (*xīnzhào qīngjìng*—心照清浄),\nthere will be no flaws or diseases.\n\nThe *Xīshēng Jīng* says:\n*\"The spirit that gives life to me is the spirit (*shén*—神),\nbut the mind that harms me is the mind (*xīn*—心).\"*\nThus, the teaching is to regulate the mind (*xiūxīn*—修心),\nto control intentions and thoughts, and return to a state free from worries.\n\nCan one govern the people and the state (*àimín lǐguó*—爱民理国) without action (*wúwéi*—无为)?\nThe people are the foundation of the state (*guóběn*—国本).\n*Wúwéi* (无为) is the transformation of the *Dao*.\nIf one governs with the transformation of *wúwéi*—\nloving and nurturing the people—\nthen the foundation of the state is secured.\nIf governance is harsh and oppressive (*zhèngzhèng kuāiyí*—政虐而苛),\nthen it becomes tyranny (*bàomì*—暴).\nIf taxes are heavy and labor burdensome (*fùzhòng yìfán*—赋重役繁),\nthen it harms the people’s nature (*shāngxìng*—伤性).\nIf one does not act according to the seasons (*shǐzhī bùyǐshí*—使之不以时),\nthen it disrupts agriculture (*fángnóng*—妨农).\nIf one does not practice frugality and simplicity (*bùmù jiǎnyuē*—不务俭约),\nthen the value of grain will diminish (*jiàngǔ*—贱谷).\nThis is the teaching on governing the state (*lǐguó*—理国).\n\nThe essence of being a ruler (*jūnzǐ*—君子) is to take the *Dao* as foundation\nand *dé* (德—virtue/power) as root.\nIf one loses the *Dao* and virtue/power, how can they rule over the people?\nThis is the core of the *Laozi*’s teaching on governing the state.\n\nCan one open and close the *Tiānmén* (天门—the \"Heavenly Gate\") without imbalance (*wúcī*—无雌)?\nEven after cultivating the love of the people and the governance of the state,\nand becoming a ruler who sits in state (*chuíyī nánmiàn*—垂衣南面),\none must still respect oneself and follow Heaven,\nto align with the natural order (*lìshù*—历数).\n*Lìshù* refers to the received mandate (*shòumìng*—受命) of Heaven\nand the cycles of the *Wǔyùn* (五运—the Five Phases).\n\nShun commanded Yu:\n*\"The mandate of Heaven and its cycles rest upon you.\"*\nWhen the celestial blessings (*tiānlù*—天禄) are eternal and enduring (*yǒngzhōng*—永终),\nit means that the mandate and cycles are upon you,\nto inherit Heaven’s command and thus become a great treasure (*dàbǎo*—大宝) for the people.\nThis is called *bǎomìng* (宝命—\"treasured mandate\").\nIt is granted from Heaven, hence it is said to be received from Heaven.\nThe *Yìjīng* (易经) *Xì* (系) says:\n*\"The greatest treasure of the sage is called ‘position’ (位).\"*\nWhen the *Tiānmén* (天门) opens, extraordinary celestial omens descend (*jiàngfēicháng*—降非常之瑞),\nsuch as the Yellow Star moving with vibrant colors (*huángxīng dòngcǎi*—黄星动彩),\nthe Red Star appearing and displaying auspicious symbols (*chìfú biǎofú*—赤伏表符),\nthe Purple *Qi* (气) filling the courtyard (*zǐqì chōngtíng*—紫气充庭),\nthe Five Stars gathering at the Well (*wǔxīng jùjǐng*—五星聚井),\nthe Rainbow flowing through the moon (*liúhóng guànyuè*—流虹贯月),\nthe Great Thunder encircling the celestial axis (*dàdiàn rào shū*—大电绕枢),\nand the celestial blessings descending upon mountains to bestow worthy ministers (*yìngyuè jiàngxián*—应天顺人, 拯物除害),\nand the birth of stars to command assistance (*dànxīng mìngfǔ*—诞星命辅).\nThus, one responds to Heaven and follows the people,\nrelieving suffering and removing harm,\nwhile inheriting the mandate and cycles to possess the world (*yǒutiānxià*—有天下).\n\nBut when a ruler loses their proper place (*lín yù shīsuǒ*—临御失所),\ntheir punishments and policies become misaligned (*xíngzhèng kuāiyí*—刑政乖宜),\nand the people rebel while kin abandon them (*zhòngpàn qīnlí*—众叛亲离),\nthen war and calamity arise (*bīngjiāo huòqǐ*—兵交祸起).\nWhen rebellion and disorder emerge from below (*nìlùn shēngyúxià*—逆乱生於下),\nthe celestial signs manifest above (*qìxiàng jiànyúshàng*—气象见於上),\nsuch as the sky splitting open (*xiāotiān kāi*—霄天开),\nmountains collapsing and rivers drying up (*shānbēng chuānjié*—山崩川竭),\nand disasters swarming like bees (*zāi xiōng fēngqǐ*—灾凶蜂起),\nuntil the state perishes (*guówáng*—国亡).\nThis is the closing of the *Tiānmén* (天门).\n\nThe alternation of opening and closing is called *biàn* (变)—\nas the *Yìjīng* (易经) *Xì* (系) states:\n*\"The meaning of opening and closing is that yin and yang follow in succession,\nand the principles of dependence and withdrawal (*yīfú*—倚伏) are fulfilled.\"*\n\nTo diminish fullness and increase humility (*kuī yíng ér yì qiān*—亏盈而益谦)—\nas the *Yì* (易) *Qián* (谦) *guà* (卦) states:\n*\"To reduce excess and increase humility,\njust as the sun reaches its zenith and then declines (*rìzhōng zé jiǎ*—日中则昃),\nand the moon, when full, begins to wane (*yuè yíng zé kuī*—月盈则亏).\"*\n\nThe fullness, once diminished, then humility receives its benefit—\nthis is the power of dependence and withdrawal (*yīfú*—倚伏).\n\nThe **Laozi** admonishes: *\"When a ruler receives the Mandate of Heaven and governs the people,\nhe must embody the receptive and tranquil virtue of the female,\npractice governance of simplicity and non-action,\nalign with the natural course of Heaven,\nand thus shepherd all under his care.\"*\n\nAgain,

weary from sounds and colors,\nthe nose and mouth labor over scents and flavors.\nWhen the **soul** (*pò—魄*) moves as it wills and the **spirit** (*shén—神*) follows,\nthen the **soul bears the spirit** (*shén cháng zài pò—神常载魄*).\n\nThus, one is taught to **embrace the spirit and bear the soul** (*bào shén zài pò—抱神载魄*), so that the two never part—\nthis is indeed the **Dao/Way** by which the **sages cultivate the self** (*shèngrén suǒyǐ xiūshēn zhī yào—圣人所以修身之要*).\nAs for the **ancient True Ones** (*gǔ zhēnrén—古之真人*), deeply rooted and firmly established,\nlong-lived and enduring in vision—\ntheir **Dao/Way** also arises from this.\n\nCan one **focus the qi and attain softness** (*zhuāng qì zhì róu—专气致柔*) like an infant?\nIf the **spirit** (*shén—神*) is not governed, the **qi** (*qì—气*) is disordered—\nthe strong delight in excess, the weak delight in fear,\nyet they know it not.\nWhen the **spirit** is governed, the **qi** does not act wantonly—\njoy and anger follow their kind—\nthis is called **focusing the qi** (*zhuāng qì—专气*).\nWhen **spirit is utterly empty** (*shén xū zhī zhì—神虚之至*), **qi is truly substantial** (*qì shí zhī shǐ—气实之始*).\nThe utmost emptiness is softness, the utmost substance is hardness—\nto preserve purity of nature and lose the **qi** is called **attaining softness** (*zhì róu—致柔*).\nAn infant knows no likes or dislikes—\nthus its nature is whole.\nWhen nature is whole, the **qi** is subtle,\nand when the **qi** is subtle, the body is soft.\nTo **focus the qi and attain softness** (*zhuāng qì zhì róu—专气致柔*) is to reach the extreme of an infant.\n\nCan one **purify and perceive the mysterious** (*xǐchú xuànlǎn—涤除玄览*) without flaw?\nThe **sage**, neither borne by the **soul** externally nor ruled by the **qi** internally,\nthus purges all dust and filth—\nand so the **spirit** becomes vast and clear.\nGazing upon all things in their **mystery** (*xuàn—玄*), knowing they all arise from nature,\nequally observing purity and defilement without blemish—\n\nCan one **love the people and govern the state** (*ài mín zhì guó—爱民治国*) without action?\nHaving cultivated the self, extending this further to others—\neven in loving the people and governing the state,\none meets them with **non-action** (*wúxīn—无心*).\nIf there is **intent** (*xīn—心*), then those who love the people harm them,\nand those who govern the state disrupt them.\n\nCan one **open and close the Heavenly Gate** (*tiānmén kāihé—天门开阖*) without yielding?\nThe **Heavenly Gate** (*tiānmén—天门*) is the source of order and chaos, rise and decline.\nHaving taken the self to bear the world,\nwhen the opening and closing, the gathering and scattering occur,\nthe common folk value virtue yet fear loss—\nthey act in advance to court fortune.\nThe **sage** follows principle and knows the **Heavenly Command** (*tiānmìng—天命*), thus waits for the lead before responding.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"To act before Heaven is to meet Heaven’s resistance—\nyet this is not to act before Heaven;\nto act after Heaven is to follow Heaven’s time—\nyet this is not to act after Heaven.\"*\nIt speaks only of acting neither too early nor too late,\nalways aligning with **Heavenly Command** (*tiānmìng—天命*).\nOtherwise, acting too soon will fail,\nacting too late will also fail.\nThus, the one who can **yield** (*cí—雌*) does not lose the time.\n\nCan one be **clear and far-reaching** (*míngbái sìdá—明白四达*) without knowing?\nCultivating the self internally, governing the state externally—\nwhen facing change, all is guided by **Dao/Way** (*dào—道*).\nIs this not the work of one who is **clear and far-reaching** (*míngbái sìdá—明白四达*)?\n**Clarity and reach** (*míngbái sìdá—明白四达*) is the **heart** (*xīn—心*).\nThis **heart** knows nothing yet knows all—\nyet it never harbors a knowing mind.\nThe **heart** is one—\nif another knowing arises, then it is two.\nFrom one to two, the source of obstruction is born,\nand the origin of folly begins.\nNow, when objects approach a mirror,\nit responds—\nyet how can one say the mirror *knows* what it reflects?\nThe root is without knowing,\nyet the mind imposes it—\nthis is the source of delusion.\n\n**Fostering growth** (*chù zhī—畜之*) and **generating life** (*shēng zhī—生之*)—\nthis is called **mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德*).\nIts **Dao/Way**, sufficient to **foster growth** and **generate life** for all things,\nyet it does not possess, does not rely, does not butcher—\nthough it has great virtue/power,\nyet none know it.\nThus it is called **mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德*).\n\n**Lǚ Jìfǔ** (*lǚ jìfǔ—吕吉甫*) says:\n*\"To bear the soul and spirit* (*zài yíng pò—载营魄*).\nFor long has humanity possessed its body,\nyet to retreat from it, to embody the **Dao/Way of Heaven** (*tiāndào—天道*)\nwithout the burden of fame and gain—\nis this not difficult?\nYet there is a **Dao/Way** to it.\nAt the beginning of life, it is called **soul** (*pò—魄*).\nWhen **soul** and **essence** (*jīng—精*) are one,\nit is still and complete.\nOnce the **soul** is born, the **spirit** (*hún—魂*) is yang.\nThe **spirit** and **spirit** (*shén—神*) move in exchange,\nwhile the **soul** and **essence** enter and exit—\nthen the **soul** is scattered and does not **bear** (*zài—载*), separated and does not **embrace** (*bào—抱*).\n\n**Bearing** (*zài—载*) means the cycle of end and beginning;\n**embracing** (*yíng—营*) means encircling without gap.\nCan one **embrace the One** (*bào yī—抱一*) without separation?\nThough already a person,\nif one bears the **soul and spirit** and embraces the One,\ntranquilly without action,\nlike the beginning of life’s transformation—\nthen one can truly separate.\n\nCan one **focus the qi and attain softness** (*zhuāng qì zhì róu—专气致柔*) like an infant?\nTo be without separation is to focus the **qi** without division,\nto attain softness without resistance—\nthus one can be like an infant.\n\nCan one **purify and perceive the mysterious** (*xǐchú xuànlǎn—涤除玄览*) without flaw?\nTo be like an infant is to purge regret and stinginess,\nto gaze upon the subtle mysteries—\nevery subtle movement that disturbs me,\nI must know it—\nand thus be without flaw.\n\nCan one **open and close the Heavenly Gate** (*tiānmén kāihé—天门开阖*) without yielding?\nInternally, to purify and perceive the mysterious without flaw,\nexternally, to love the people and govern the state without action—\nthen the **Heavenly Gate** will be within me,\nand I can truly yield.\n\nCan one be **clear and far-reaching** (*míngbái sìdá—明白四达*) without knowing?\nNot pushing, not welcoming, responding yet not hoarding—\nthen one is **clear and far-reaching**,\nand can truly be without knowing.\nWhen **Dao/Way** reaches **non-knowing** (*wúzhī—无知*), then it is true knowing.\nThus, to be human yet embody Heaven—\nwhat burden of fame and gain remains?\nThis is called **mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德*).\n\n**Fostering growth** (*chù zhī—畜之*) and **generating life** (*shēng zhī—生之*), yet not possessing,\nacting yet not relying, growing long yet not butchering—\nthis is its true nature.\n**Mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德*) is none other than **Heavenly virtue/power** (*tiāndé—天德*).\n\n**Lù Nóngshī** (*lù nóngshī—陆农师*) says:\n*\"To bear the soul and spirit* (*zài yíng pò—载营魄*).\nThe **spirit** (*hún—魂*) is yang, yang is movement.\nThe **soul** (*pò—魄*) is yin, yin is stillness.\nThe **soul** is the **spirit’s** assistant—\nits movement has change yet no transformation.\nThe **soul** is **essence’s** support—\nits stillness has transformation yet no change.\nThus, the **spirit** is spoken of as **wandering** (*yóu—游*), the **soul** as **bearing** (*yíng—营*).\n**Wandering spirit** (*yóu hún—游魂*) speaks to its change,\n**bearing soul** (*yíng pò—营魄*) speaks to its stillness.\nCan one be without separation?\nTo **bear the soul and spirit** (*zài yíng pò—载营魄*) is to govern externally;\nto **embrace the One** (*bào yī—抱一*) is to guard internally.\nThus it is said: *\"To bear the soul and spirit, embrace the One—\ncan one be without separation?\"*\nTo **bear the soul** (*zài pò—载魄*) is to achieve movement,\nto **embrace the One** (*bào yī—抱一*) is to achieve stillness—\nand internally and externally, they are always united without separation.\nOnly then can one **focus the qi and attain softness** (*zhuāng qì zhì róu—专气致柔*), like an infant.\n\nTo focus the qi and attain softness—can one be like an infant?\nIndeed, internal guarding is how the qi is made focused,\nexternal movement is how the qi is made soft.\nWhen guarding is focused and movement is soft,\nand one’s virtue compares to that of an infant,\nthen one’s mind can be cleansed and refined,\nits spirit washed and illuminated in Heaven.\nAll dharmas are empty, yet none burden with their weight.\nThus it is said: *\"To focus the qi and attain softness—can one be like an infant?\"*\nAnd then to purify and perceive the Mysterious—can one be without flaw?\n\nTo purify and perceive the Mysterious—can one be without flaw?\nPurification speaks of washing the heart,\nremoval speaks of excavating the heart.\nWash it, and nothing remains unclean;\nexcavate it, and nothing remains unempty.\nTranscendent and observing, all dharmas are empty—\nthen one can establish laws from emptiness,\nand share with the people the joys and calamities of fate.\nThus it is said: *\"To purify and perceive the Mysterious—can one be without flaw?\"*\n\nTo love the people and govern the state—can one act without action?\nToward the people, one loves them by not loving them;\nin governing the state, one rules by not ruling.\nThe Dao accomplishes all without doing—\nthen one can remain motionless and still,\nresponding naturally to the workings of Heaven and Earth.\nThus one acts only when unavoidable,\nresponds only when sought—\nand so it is said: *\"To love the people and govern the state—can one act without action?\"*\nAnd then to open and close the Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?\n\nThe Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?\nThe Heavenly Gate is the void.\nSpirit and qi flow in and out,\nopening and closing in unity—\nall things emerge from here, return to here,\nand their transformations are boundless.\nThe Heavenly Gate, opening and closing with all things,\nyet without duality—\nthen one can attain round enlightenment, universally illuminating,\ngreatly communicating the four directions,\npenetrating to the utmost without obstruction,\nreaching the profound without awareness.\nThus it is said: *\"To open and close the Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?\"*\nAnd then to be clear and all-pervading—can one be without knowing?\n\nTo be clear and all-pervading—can one be without knowing?\nTo bear the soul and embrace the One—can one be without separation?\nTo love the people and govern the state—can one act without action?\nThis is the Sage.\n\nTo open and close the Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?\nTo be clear and penetrating—can one be without knowing?\nThis is the Divine Person.\n\nMaster Lu Nong said:\nTo bear the soul—\nthe soul is yin, the master of form.\nThe spirit, vast and all-pervading yet unaware of itself,\nordinarily abides in the soul,\nand thus the spirit becomes constrained by the body.\nThe expansive becomes confined,\nthe fluid becomes stagnant.\nThose who study this Way must first broaden their will and qi,\nnot burdened by the body,\nso that the spirit abides in the soul and not the soul.\nThen one can embrace the One and embody the spirit.\n\nI have often reasoned:\nWhen a person dies, there are differences in ascent and descent—\ntruly because the spirit perishes to serve the form,\nfollowing the soul, descending into darkness and transforming into other things.\nBut for those whose spirit is complete,\neven if the soul is stagnant in yin,\nthe essence and spirit unite as one,\nand nothing can hinder them.\nThe Sage’s death is said to be *\"the spirit not following the soul.\"*\nAt first, even the Sage bears the soul alone.\nTo embrace the One—\nthe One is the number of essence;\nthough not called essence, to guard the One is to keep essence steady.\nCan one be without separation?\n\nLearning the Way returns to restoring nature,\nrestoring nature returns to embodying the spirit.\nWhat prevents one from embodying the spirit\nis pursuing externals while forgetting the root,\nexchanging the self for things.\nThus, losing essence and failing in spirit,\none sinks into base stupidity.\n\nThe vital essences of yin and yang are soul and spirit.\nThe soul is yang and wanders,\nwhile what anchors the body is the soul’s counterpart—\nthe soul is yin and stills.\nThus, the student must first calm their will and qi,\nso that essence and soul are tranquil and unified.\nWhen the soul is still, the spirit settles;\nwhen essence is unified, the spirit is complete.\n\nLife is born from water—water is essence.\nAt birth, essence gathers the spirit.\nOriginally whole yet unaware,\nit often scatters and dissipates—\nthis is called *wangliang* (the two shadows).\n*Wang* means the spirit is unclear,\n*liang* means essence is not unified.\nZhuangzi said: *\"Do not shake your essence—*\nthis is called embracing the One.\"*\n\nThe spirit and qi are the symbols of fire and water.\nFire has no fixed form;\nwhen essence shines, the spirit becomes boundless and formless,\nunable to be constrained by kings—\nonly preserve essence.\nLike adding oil to make fire bright,\nnurturing roots to make leaves flourish.\nWhen soul, spirit, and essence are undiminished,\nthen the heart is strong and qi flows smoothly,\nuncontrolled by things.\nStillness embodies the Dao,\naction aligns with principle—\nrefined to the utmost,\nthe spirit becomes One,\ntranscending the four names.\nThis is the ultimate subtlety of the student—\nall ages of sages and worthies follow this truth.\nSeeking lies not outside;\nit must be attained by the heart.\n\nTo focus the qi and attain softness—can one be like an infant?\nHuman life has three aspects: essence, spirit, and qi.\nWhen essence is complete, the spirit reigns;\nwhen the spirit reigns, it can command the qi.\nIf the spirit weakens and cannot command the qi,\nthen the spirit’s movements are erratic,\nleading one astray from the Way.\nMencius said: *\"The will is the commander of qi.\"*\nYang Xiong said: *\"Qi is the horse that carries one to good or evil.\nIf the teacher is weak and the troops rebellious, the teacher will perish;\nif the horse rages and the driver is exhausted, the chariot will fail.\"*\nWhen the spirit cannot focus the qi,\njoy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise from qi,\ndriving one into chaos—\nthis is the natural order.\nAncient scholars all understood this.\nIf one has not yet attained this,\nthey must first purify the heart to guard against it.\nThe three warnings of Confucius are all about guarding the qi.\nAmong his disciples, only Yan Hui could focus the qi,\nthus it is said: *\"He did not transfer his anger.\"*\nQi’s violence manifests in yang,\nand nothing is more violent than anger in yang.\nIf one can avoid transferring anger,\nwhat else is this but focusing the qi?\n\nHuman beings are originally endowed with sage nature,\nbut when qi dissipates and cannot be focused,\nit is said: *\"As one grows older, one drifts further from the Way.\"*\n\n「To embrace *Oneness* (抱一), the spirit becomes sovereign (神王).\nWhen the spirit is sovereign, the qi becomes gentle (气柔),\nand when the qi is gentle, the *Essence* (真) is preserved.\n\nThe reason one can align with an infant’s focused concentration (同专者),\nis that they possess the power without claiming authority (有而擅其权之谓).\n\nCan one purify and perceive the *Mysterious* (玄) without flaw (疵)?\nThis is the art of focusing the qi—\nwhen the qi is focused, the nature becomes settled (性定),\nand when the nature is settled, wisdom becomes clear (智明).\nWith wisdom clear, one can then wash away impurities (荡涤除去)\nand attain the *Mysterious Vision* (玄览) of utmost subtlety (至妙).\nHaving illuminated its principle (烛其理),\nall phenomena in the world become the same as this utmost subtlety.\nIf one still perceives any flaw (观一疵),\nthen one does not yet recognize the principle (非识理也).\n\nTo love the people and govern the state (爱民治国),\ncan one truly act without doing (无为)?\nAs explained above, the Way for oneself is complete (为己之道尽矣).\nThus, one can extend its remainder to others (及人也).\n\nThe Master Laozi’s teaching is focused on restoring one’s nature (复性).\nTo act with doing (有为) is not the means to let the people dwell in their true nature (安性).\nThus, though he loves governance (爱治),\nhe does not uphold doing (不尚有为)—\nthis is the ultimate Dao (此道之至也).\n\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate* (天门),\ncan one truly act without *feminine* (雌)?\nThe Sage has no intent to act (无心於作),\nbut their spirit enters and exits in response (精神出入皆应)\nwithout any artificial display (不唱).\nThis is what Zhuangzi called *\"the one who receives the essence of things\"* (有物采之者),\nand Laozi, in the season of autumn (四时当秋),\nwhen his *virtue/power* (德) generates *Metal* (金),\nwas the master of stillness and restoring *Oneness* (静一复性者也).\nHence, his teachings emphasize this.\n\nAs for the *Yijing* (《易》),\nboth the *Primordial* (先天) and *Subsequent* (后天) are nothing but the Dao (无非道者).\nTo be *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达),\nis one not to be without knowing (无知)?\nThe principle is beyond knowing (理无足知).\nKnowing is merely the response to things (知以应物).\nOnce one knows the ultimate principle (既知至理),\nthey naturally remain in constant *non-knowing* (自常无知).\nOnly through *non-knowing* can one truly know all (无所不知).\nIf one were to claim knowing (昭然有知),\nthen one is truly without knowing (是不知).\nThe subtlety of *non-knowing* (无知之妙),\nhow could it be called knowing (何足谓知也)?\n\nExamining this thoroughly (切尝论之),\nwhether one is a Sage or a fool (圣智下愚),\nthey originally share no distinction (本无殊品).\nIt is only through foolishness that wisdom becomes apparent (因愚显智),\nand thus the name of Sage arises (乃有圣名).\nThe Sage’s original heart (本心),\nhas never been inherently Sage (何尝自圣).\nHence, *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达)\nwhile initially knowing nothing (初无所知),\nis the Sage’s true knowing (乃圣人之知也).\n\nTo nurture and sustain life (生之畜之).\nThe Dao is complete as said above (道备如上),\nso that *creation and transformation* (造化) lie within oneself (在我),\nand one can nurture and sustain all things (可以生畜万物矣).\n\nTo give birth without possession (生而不有).\nThe Dao generates all things (道生万物),\nand things are always one with the Dao (物之与道常为一体).\nWho could claim to possess them?\n\nTo act without reliance (为而不恃).\nWhen forced to act (不得已而为之),\neven if one performs deeds (於已然之时),\ntheir essence transcends and self-destroys (虽有为为之功，而超然自丧),\nhow could they still boast or err (岂复矜哉)?\nTo extend without slaughtering (长而不宰).\nThe Dao, as explained above (如上文),\ncan lengthen and sustain all under Heaven without doing (可以长天下以无为矣).\nThough it stands above things like a *flagpole* (标枝),\nhow could it have the power of division (岂有分割之功乎)?\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue* (玄德).\n*Mysterious* (玄) refers to the subtle essence (妙体),\nand *virtue* (德) is the ultimate (至也).\nIn ancient times, Shun dwelled in *Mysterious Virtue* (侧微，《书》称玄德).\nTruly, the ultimate *virtue/power* (至德) is always found\nin *non-thinking and non-doing* (无思无为).\nThis chapter’s meaning centers on *non-doing* (主於无为).\nThus, though it speaks of extending (为长),\nits *virtue/power* is especially called *Mysterious* (德尤称玄).\n\nThis chapter, from the scholar (士) to attaining\nthe *entry of spirit into Sagehood* (体神入圣),\nhas fully exhausted the sequence of self-cultivation (修身之序尽矣).\n\nLiu Zhongping said:\nEmbrace *Oneness* (抱一).\n*Concentrate oneness* (致一) is the essence of its meaning (所以精义),\nembrace *Oneness* (抱一) is the means to respond to changes (所以应变),\nand *return to Oneness* (反一) is the way to enter the spirit (所以入神).\nThus, the *Way* of the gentleman begins with *concentrating oneness* (致一),\nis applied through *embracing Oneness* (抱一),\nand is hidden in *returning to Oneness* (反一).\n\nCan one focus the qi and govern with gentleness (专气政柔),\nlike an infant (婴儿)?\nWhen humans are born, in infancy the qi is focused and *Oneness* is concentrated (致一),\nreaching the utmost of *Essence* (真).\nAs they grow older, emotions arise (情生),\nreaching the utmost of *artifice* (伪).\nOnly those who understand the Dao (知道者),\nwhen they seek fame (营名), lose their *Essence* (真),\nand when they seek profit (为利), drift into *artifice* (伪).\nThis is called the ability to restore (能复者也).\n\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate* (天门),\ncan one truly act without *feminine* (雌)?\nOpening and closing (开阖) are the applications of transformation (变化之用).\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Qian* (乾) employs *beauty* (美) and *advantage* (利) to benefit all under Heaven,\nbut does not speak of what it benefits—\ngreat indeed!\" (不言所利，大矣哉).\nThis means the *Qian* (乾) Dao employs *greatness* (大) as its function (为用).\nIf one transforms by the *Qian* Dao,\nthey also employ *greatness* in their function (用乎大).\nTo guard its *feminine* (守其雌) is merely to say,\n\"I am what I naturally protect\" (盖言吾所自守云耳).\nIf one can guard its *feminine*,\nthen their function must surely be *great* (其用也必大).\n\nTo be *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达),\ncan one truly be without knowing (无知)?\nIf one strives to be *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达)\nwhile anxiously attending to maintaining harmony (汲汲乎以事平和),\nis this not small (不亦小乎)?\nThus, there is knowing that is small (有知小)\nand there is knowing through *non-knowing* (无知之知).\n\nLiu Jiji said:\nTo *carry and sustain* (载) the *vital energies and spirit* (营魄).\nWhen humans are born, the *yang* energies (诸阳) are the *hun* (魂),\nand the *yin* energies (诸阴) are the *po* (魄).\nEach has its name and form (名象),\nand is stored between the liver and lungs (藏於肝肺之间).\nThe lesser scholar knows of them (下士知之),\nwhile the greater scholar perceives them (上士见之).\nThe *Essence* (精) and *spirit* (神) rely on one another to generate life (相依以生),\nand together, the *Essence* entering and exiting (并精出入),\nis the *po* (魄).\nThe *hun* (魂) is what comes and goes with the *spirit* (神).\nThis chapter speaks of *carrying and sustaining* (载营魄),\nand *camp* (营) is the same as *hun* (魂).\nThe Yellow Emperor said:\n*\"To move and sustain the body is called the *hun* (动以营身，谓之魂).\"*\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"A wandering *hun* (游魂) is transformation,\"*\nand Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Its *hun* (魂) does not grow weary,\"*\nall referring to *hun* (魂),\nwhich governs movement and action (主经营动作),\nserving as the vital function of the body (为一身之运).\nAs for the *po* (魄),\nit is the *Essence* entering and exiting (并精出入),\nand nothing but the generation and transformation of life (生化成变).\n\nNow, the hundred bones and nine orifices (百骸九窍)\ncomposing one’s form (具吾形),\nare all the *po* (魄)'s domain (魄之属也).\nIf not for the *po* (魄) to sustain them (以营之),\nwhat would distinguish them from a *walking corpse* (行尸)?\n\nThe *po* (魄) cannot exist without the *hun* (魂),\njust as the moon cannot exist without the sun (犹月不可以无日).\nThe *po* (魄) depends on the *hun* (魂) to form *camp* (营),\nand the moon depends on the sun to generate light (月待日而生光).\nHere, it speaks of the *hun*’s function (魂之用) as *camp* (营),\nand the *po*’s essence (魄之体) as *po* (魄).\n\n*Carry* (载) means to bear with form (以形载).\nForm is like a *chariot* (车).\nThe *po* (魄) and *hun* (魂) are the *chariot*’s accumulation (车之积).\nIn the world, there are those who carry the *hun* (魂) but not the *po* (魄),\nthose who carry the *po* (魄) but not the *hun* (魂),\nand those who carry both *hun* and *po* (魂魄两载).\n\nTo carry the *hun* without the *po* is the greater scholar (上士).\nTo carry the *po* without the *hun* is the lesser scholar (下士).\nTo carry both is the middle scholar (中士).\nThe greater scholar preserves their *yang* purity and ascends as a *transcendent* (浮仙),\nthe lesser scholar is impure and sinks into the *ghostly* (沉鬼),\nwhile the middle scholar cultivates their form (修其形).\n\nCan one embrace *Oneness* without separation (抱一能无离)?\nTo carry and sustain the *vital energies and spirit* (载营魄),\ntheir practice lies solely in embracing *Oneness* (抱一).\nThe Dao generates *Oneness* (道生一),\n*Oneness* generates *Water* (一生水),\n*Water* generates *Essence* (水生精),\nand *Essence* is the substance of *Oneness* (精者一之物).\nTo embrace *Oneness* is to unite with *Essence* (与精合),\nwhile to abandon *Oneness* is to separate from *Essence* (脱一则与精离矣).」\n\nWhen *Essence* is complete, *qi* is whole, and when *qi* is whole, *spirit* is whole—\nwith *spirit* whole, one may govern the *hun* (soul),\nand thus the *po* (ethereal soul) belongs to the greater scholar.\n\nFor *Essence* is the source by which Heaven and Earth, all things, are born and formed.\nYet *Essence* is ever stingy to man, while man ever wastes it—\nleaking through orifices without measure,\nuntil the *yin* is exhausted and death ensues—\nthen it is said that *Essence* has departed.\nBut it is not that *Essence* has truly departed—\nrather, man himself has caused its separation.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Not to depart from Essence is called a Divine Person.\"*\nThus it is said: *\"Can one truly not depart?\"*\n\nCan one focus *qi* and attain supreme softness?\nTo focus *qi* means *qi* is not dispersed;\nto attain softness means to reach utmost harmony—\nthis is the natural state of an infant.\nIf one who cultivates the Dao can be thus,\nthen *qi* will be whole.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said:\n*\"The origin of *born qi* is the root of the Twelve Meridians—*\nthat which stirs between the kidneys.\nFor all that enters and exits through the nose and mouth,\nall movements of the hands and feet,\nare nourished by the Five Grains, supplemented by the Five Livestock,\nassisted by the Five Fruits, filled by the Five Vegetables,\nmoistened by wine and rice wine,\nand balanced by fragrant herbs and medicinal stones—\nharmonized and refined, they enter the meridians as *honor* (nutritive *qi*),\nsmooth and swift, circulating to defend the skin—\nall are but the secondary functions of *born qi*,\nwhile its source is guarded between the kidneys,\nfrom which the myriad three thousand five hundred breaths arise.\n\nWhen this *qi* flows into knowledge and desire,\nit becomes unfocused and loses its softness,\nwhile joy, anger, sorrow, and delight manifest within,\nand youth, vigor, aging, and death manifest without—\na seven-foot frame, yet but as dung and soil.\n\nAn infant, unaware of male and female union,\nhas *qi* that may be called focused.\nTo wail all day without hoarseness—\nits harmony is extreme.\n\nMan is born with *commission* (and *response*) in harmony,\nyet what causes discord is failing to focus *qi* and instead acting violently.\n\nThus, the subtle principle of preserving whole *qi* is as follows:\n*\"The Perfect Man does not lose the heart of an infant.\"*\n\nCan one purify and gaze into the profound without blemish?\nThe heart harbors *spirit*—\nthe heart is like a mirror,\n*spirit* like a valley.\nTo exhaust the principles of the world in a single illumination—\nthat is the heart alone.\n\nYet those who can illuminate with *spirit* must delve deeply,\nfor their darkness is profound and their vision distant—\nthus it is called *profound gazing*.\nThe heart is inherently profound and gazing,\nyet what defiles it, making it unclear?\nWhat obstructs it, making it unvast?\nOnly when one cannot master things does *Essence* depart,\n*qi* weaken, and *spirit* leave—\nwhen *spirit* departs, one falls into darkness and faintness,\nfor all things are defiled, all things are obstructed.\n\nAs when a man walks at night and sees nothing—\nthis is his clarity,\nyet it is self-purified;\nthis is his vastness,\nyet it is self-emptied.\n\nThus, the ailments of *profound gazing* do not come from without.\nOnly the Sage can illuminate without purification—\nthis is not a matter of cultivating the Dao.\nAs Zhuangzi said: *\"To reach it is to enter its blemish.\"*\n\nThis chapter takes preserving whole *Essence*, whole *qi*, and whole *spirit*\nas the root of cultivating the Dao.\nThus, *\"not departing\"* speaks to nurturing *Essence*,\n*\"like an infant\"* speaks to nurturing *qi*,\nand *\"without blemish\"* speaks to nurturing *spirit*.\n\nTo love the people and govern the state—\ncan one act without doing?\nZhuangzi said: *\"The true Dao governs the body,\nits remnants govern the state.\"*\nTo love the people is *ren* (benevolence).\nTo govern the state is *zheng* (administration).\nThe affairs of kings and lords cannot avoid action,\nyet if viewed as straw dogs,\nthey may be attained.\n\nCan the *Heavenly Gate* open and close without distinction?\nHe who accomplishes affairs must follow the Dao of Heaven—\nthus this speaks of the *Heavenly Gate*.\nZhuangzi said: *\"The Heavenly Gate has no existence.\nAll things arise from non-existence.\"*\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"One closing, one opening, is called *change*.\"*\nFor the Dao of Heaven governs *change*—\nto love the people and govern the state\nis to follow Heaven alone.\nWhy seek to act like a male?\nIf unavoidable, then respond—but no more.\n\nTo be clear and all-reaching—\ncan one know without knowing?\n*Clarity* is knowing;\n*all-reaching* is knowing without knowing.\nIf one knows both self and others,\nthen one may be said to know without knowing.\nNot retreating into secrecy—\nif one can know without knowing while containing wisdom,\nthen *hun* and *po* may fear they have no vessel,\nand *spirit*, *qi*, and *Essence* may fear they cannot be preserved—\nperhaps then one may attain two hundred years without decay of form.\n\nTo give birth and to nurture—\n*giving birth* is the Dao,\n*nurturing* is *virtue*.\nAs spoken above, this is not for those who do not embody *Dao* and *virtue*.\n\nTo give birth without possessing—\nI give birth to it, yet do not possess it;\nnot possessing it, then my giving birth is not my possession.\nTo act without relying—\nif one gives birth without acting, the principle of life is severed;\nthough one acts, if one relies upon it, one loses what was done.\nTo grow without controlling—\nI give birth to it, I act upon it—\nthis is enough to nourish all things.\nWithout me, there is supreme nurturing—\nthis is called *profound virtue*.\nTo call *profound* a *virtue*—\nhow could one possess, rely, or control it?\nTo not possess, not rely, not control—\nthus it is called the *Dao*.\nOnce action is complete, the *Dao* descends as *virtue*—\nthus it is called *profound virtue*.\n*Profound virtue* is what, above, encompasses the *Dao*.\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of withdrawing from worldly affairs,\nyet sought closeness to the body—\nthus next comes *carrying the vital energies and spirit*.\nLiu Ji said: *\"From carrying the vital energies and spirit to this is called profound virtue.\"*\n\nThe *hun* is a *yang* thing,\nthe *po* is a *yin* thing.\nOne *yin* and one *yang*—this is the *Dao*;\nexcess *yin* or excess *yang*—this is illness.\n*Yin* is the complement of *yang*, yet also its bane—\nthus the *hun* carries the *po* and nurtures it,\nso that *yin* and *yang* may harmonize,\nneither harming the other, and *virtue* returns to them.\nYet is there another way?\nIt is simply *Oneness* that governs it.\n\n*Oneness* is a thing not two—\nits generation of things is unfathomable,\nneither *yin* nor *yang*,\nyet not separate from *yin* and *yang*—\nit can harmonize *yin* and *yang*.\nThus, to carry the vital energies and spirit while embracing *Oneness*—\ncan one truly not depart?\n\nThe Sage embraces *Oneness* without departing,\nthe heart containing nothing—\nwithin the boundless and boundless,\n*spirit* is guarded;\nwithin the dim and dim,\n*spirit* is naturally true.\n\n---\n\nCultivate the *qi* without admixture,\nnurture softness without violence—\nthus one is like an infant.\n\nAn infant in its cradle knows not what to do,\nwalks without knowing where it goes,\nall day gazes yet its eyes never blink,\nall day cries yet its throat never grows hoarse—\nthis is the utmost harmony.\n\nThe Sage washes his heart with this,\nretires and hides within the profound,\nthus purging all thoughts,\nand perceiving the subtle and wondrous *Dao*—\nwhat flaw could remain?\n\nThis is Laozi’s teaching of returning to the origin,\nfollowed by loving the people and governing the state—\nwhy so?\n\nBecause the body is a microcosm of the state.\nThe Sage takes the heart as sovereign,\nthe body as the realm,\n*qi* as the people—\nthus, *wuwei* is the way to honor the sovereign.\n\nWhen the heart practices *wuwei*, it is exalted above all,\nand the myriad *qi* move spontaneously,\nthe hundred limbs govern themselves.\nPreserving *qi* is how one loves the people,\nnurturing the form is how one governs the state.\n\nIn *wuwei*, one governs the world with abundance;\nin *youwei*, one serves the world yet lacks sufficiency.\nThus, to love the people and govern the state—\nhow could one not practice *wuwei*?\n\n*Wuwei* means *wuwei*—yet nothing remains undone.\nThe Heavenly Gate opens of its own accord,\nthe Earthly Gate closes itself.\nThe Heavenly Gate is where spirit enters and departs.\nWhen the Heavenly Gate opens and shuts,\nthe spirit can move freely,\nsitting in one place yet wandering boundless realms.\n\nYet if the spirit wanders without restraint,\nthere are places it cannot reach—\nthus, it must be still,\nand align with *yin*’s virtue.\n\nWhen the primal spirit is still,\ntrue nature shines forth,\ncapable of mirroring Heaven and Earth,\nilluminating the ten thousand things.\n\nYet if wisdom is overused,\nit will falter at times.\nThus, clarity and openness—\nhow could one not embrace *wu*?\n\nWhat is called \"clever, enlightened, and wise\"\nis guarded by *yū* (primordial stupor).\n\nWisdom unused is true—\nstillness and tranquility nourish each other,\nknowing and serenity cultivate one another,\naligning with Heaven and Earth in essence,\nmatching Creation in function—\nits *Dao* can generate the ten thousand things,\nits *virtue* can nourish the world.\n\nThus it is said: *\"To generate and to nourish.\"*\nTo generate without claiming the deed,\nto act without relying on action,\nto foster without ruling—\nthis is the *Classic*’s teaching:\n*\"Its achievements cover the world yet seem not its own,\nits transformations benefit all things yet the people do not depend on them.\"*\n\nZhao Shizhan says:\nAt the outset, the root principle:\n*\"Gold and Fire seize the form.\"*\nThen comes *\"loading the *hun* and *po*.\"*\nRecognizing the limits of Heaven’s timing,\nknowing the impermanence of external things—\ndiscarding the former, taking the latter—\nthus lies the *Dao* of longevity.\n\nHence, it continues with *\"loading the *hun* and *po*.\"*\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Establish Heaven’s *Dao*—*yin* and *yang*.*\n*Yin* and *yang* are things that seek each other.\"\n\nThe spirit of one’s body is called *hun* and *po*;\n*hun* and *po* are the *Dao* of mutual exchange.\n*Hun* is *yang*, *po* is *yin*;\n*po* draws from *yang* to manifest,\n*hun* depends on *po* to stand.\nWhen *hun* is full, *po* is born;\nwhen *hun* fades, *po* retreats.\nThis is the rhythm of the sun and moon’s passage,\nthe ebb and flow of *yin* and *yang*—\nHeaven’s eternal order.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: *\"Zāi, the birth of *po*—*\nthis is the moon.\nIt shines bright in the east,\nand *zāi* (wanes) in the west—\nmeaning a month of thirty days,\nthe numbers five and six.\nThree days before the waning,\nthree days before the new—\nsubtracting six days.\nThe upper and lower crescents—\nfour and six, twenty-four.\nThe six days before and after—\ntotaling thirty days.\n\nFrom its birth to the upper crescent,\ngradually full—this is *hun*.\nFrom the sixteenth day, turning to the *xùn* position,\ngradually waning—this is *po*.\nAs it nears the waning, *po* vanishes.\nAt this time, the Great *Yin* is in *gèn*,\nand aligns with the sun’s *qi*.\n*Zhèn* arrives to receive the talisman,\nrefining the born *po*—\nuntil three days pass,\nwhen *zāi* is born in *gēng*’s earth.\nThis is *\"loading the *hun* and *po*.\"*\n\nThough called *po*,\nin truth it is *hun*.\nFor it has substance, substance coming from *yang*.\nNow called *po*—\nthe moon belongs to Metal,\nMetal governs the lungs,\nthe lungs govern *po*—\nspeaking of its form, it is called *po*.\n\nWhen it shines bright in the west and gazes east,\nthis is Metal overcoming Fire.\nThe east is Wood,\nWood governs *Zhèn*,\nWood generates Fire,\nFire is *yang*.\nWood is the liver,\nthe liver is *yin* within *yang*,\nthe liver governs *hun*—*yang*.\n*Yang* belongs to Fire—\nthus Metal seizes Fire to take form.\n\nFrom the third day to the full moon,\n*po* within *hun* is full—\nnow possessing the *Qián* body.\nThe six positions of *Qián* are all called *jiǔ*—\n*nine*, the ultimate *yang*.\n*Yang* is Fire.\nWhen the moon is full,\nit possesses the *Qián* body.\nMetal seizing Fire’s form—\nthis is the four *jiǔ* generating Metal.\n*Nine* resides in the *Lí* position,\nempty to symbolize the moon—\nthus *Lí* is the \"central maiden,\"\nthe maiden symbolizing *yin*.\n\nAgain, *Zhèn* receives the *gēng* talisman—\nthe *Kūn* of the west transforms into *Zhèn*.\nThree days mark the initial *jiǔ*.\nOn the eighth day, *xīn* emerges—\na second transformation into *Duì*—\nnow the *jiǔ* of the second position.\nBy the tenth day, the *Qián* body is complete,\nfilling the east with *jiǎ*.\n*Qián* governs the six *jiǎ*,\nthe Flying Dragon in Heaven.\nThe third position of *jiǔ*—\nthis is the waxing and waning of *yin* and *yang* seen in the moon.\nA month of thirty days,\nthree hundred sixty moments—\nmatching the year’s count.\n\nRefining the elixir must first attend to the Fire’s timing—\nFire can be drawn from Heaven,\nthus the trigrams are Heaven’s talismans.\nThe *Fire Record* takes the *Classic of Changes* as its standard:\nsixty-four trigrams, excluding *Qián*, *Kūn*, *Kǎn*, and *Lí*—\nonly sixty remain.\n*Lún* at dawn, *Méng* at dusk mark the beginning;\nfifteen days advance to *Dà Zhàng*’s end.\nFifteen days retreat from *Jìn* to *Wèi Jì*’s end.\nThe Fire’s timing advances and retreats,\nthe *qi*’s shifts follow the day—\nseen in the moon’s waxing and waning.\nWhen the upper crescent comes, advance;\nwhen the lower crescent comes, retreat.\n\nThe *Classic* speaks of *\"loading the *hun* and *po*\"*—\nthis is the Tiger and Dragon’s union,\nthe infant and maiden seizing the spirit,\nrefining into *yù yè* (jade fluid).\nThe medicine’s sprout is fresh,\nthe initial *jiǔ* advances the Fire.\nA time to guard with care—\nno deviation allowed.\n\nThus, *\"embracing Oneness\"*—\nto abandon it is to lose,\nto neglect it is to die.\n\n「Thus, when the foundation is firmly established and cannot be uprooted,\nuntil the moment when the **yáng** embryo descends into the lower furnace,\nits breath is left to its own accord,\nand the **Dao** is fulfilled.\n\nTherefore, the *Classic* does not speak of *numbers* but speaks of *numbers*,\ndoes not speak of *medicines* but speaks of *medicines*.\nThe principles of **Lead (Qīan)** and **Mercury (Gǒng)** are fully contained here.\n\n**Next, the method of refining with the *jiǎ* (metal):**\nSix stages in total.\n1. **Taming and subduing the Golden Tiger (Jīn Hǔ).**\n   Can one who embraces Oneness remain undivided?\n\n   The six transformations are the **Dao**.\n   The name of the transformation is the union of **sun and moon**.\n   Before their union, there is no **yin and yang**;\n   after their union, they correspond to **water and fire**.\n   This is the **Heaven and Earth’s natural Elixir (Huán Dān)**.\n\n   The natural Elixir of Heaven and Earth is inherently possessed,\n   neither abandoned nor detached.\n   When we speak of \"embracing,\" it means\n   that humans cannot align with Heaven and Earth’s natural spontaneity.\n   By relying on the three substances—**Lead, Mercury, and Metal (Jīn)**—\n   through the symbols of the transformation,\n   we seize the natural **qi** of Heaven and Earth,\n   manipulate the furnace and crucible,\n   and refine the supreme medicine.\n   Thus, we emulate Heaven and Earth’s natural spontaneity.\n\n   When speaking of humans, \"embracing Oneness\" means\n   to remain undivided—\n   this is yet unpermitted speech.\n\n   In general, when people speak of \"embracing Oneness,\"\n   what constitutes this \"One\"?\n\n   If \"One\" is taken as a *number*, some say it is akin to **four (Lì)**;\n   if \"One\" is taken as *advancement*, some say it is like **muddying the tracks (Nì)**.\n   One must extinguish this \"One\"\n   to verify the essence of **profound stillness (Zhàn Jìng)**.\n   These are all methods of annihilation,\n   not the **Dao of eternal transformation**.\n\n   Therefore, the **Supreme Sage (Tài Shàng)** says:\n   *\"To know the One is to complete all things.\n   To not know the One is to have nothing to know.\n   This is a profound statement.\"*\n\n   When speaking of *numbers*, from One comes Two,\n   from Two comes Three.\n   When speaking of **qi**, the One is the **original breath (Shǐ qì)**,\n   the original being **pre-Heaven (Xiān Tiān)**,\n   the same as the **Dao’s substance (tǐ)**.\n   For humans, it is the **foundation of life (mìng)**.\n   To establish the root of life,\n   what is more fundamental than the One?\n   The One is formless and boundless,\n   dispersed throughout all things.\n\n   Today’s \"embracing Oneness\" is actually the **embracing of yang**.\n   Life and vitality arise from this.\n   **Liezi** says:\n   *\"Is the **Dao** formless?\n   It is called embracing the **void (xū)** yet not the void—\n   the **symbols (xiàng)** cannot be deceived;\n   it is called embracing the **real (shí)** yet not the real—\n   the **Dao’s essence** is without attachment.\n   This is the mystery of having and not having,\n   which cannot be preserved by itself—\n   this is the **Dao’s subtlety**.\"*\n\n   Thus, one knows that the One is the **Dao**.\n   The **Dao** is the **principle of yin and yang (yáng)**.\n   The **Dao** is **yin and yang** themselves.\n   Therefore, the **Dao** is called **One yin and One yang**,\n   and it is also said, **\"transformation is called eternal generation.\"**\n   The **yin and yang** generate each other,\n   their transformations endless,\n   like the **sun and moon’s** separation and union,\n   their **eclipse and manifestation** following natural law.\n\n   Hence, at the moon’s initial birth,\n   seizing fire for **nourishment (yǎng)**,\n   one transformation leads to **nine (jiǔ)**,\n   nine being **nine yangs (Jiǔ yáng)**,\n   so embracing Oneness cannot be abandoned.\n\n   The *Fire Record (Huǒ Jì)* says:\n   *\"Heaven has symbols—**sun, moon, and stars**;\n   Earth has symbols—**water, fire, and metal (jīn)**.\n   Though the moon is metal,\n   where is its form?\n   It is the **qi of the west**.\n   **Shén Hé Zǐ** says:\n   *\"The west lacks the **original qi of metal (yuán)** borrowed from the east,\n   the north’s **qi** is **water**,\n   water also has no form,\n   the south’s **qi** is **fire**,\n   fire also has no **symbol**.\n   These are **true water and true fire**.\"*\n\n   Therefore, the *Immortal Classic (Xiān Jīng)* says:\n   *\"Black Lead is the **Water Tiger (shuǐ hǔ)**,\n   the root of Heaven and Earth’s subtle transformations,\n   without substance yet with **qi**.\n   Red Lead is the **Fire Dragon (huǒ lóng)**,\n   the **qi** of Heaven and Earth’s subtle transformations arising,\n   with **qi** yet without substance.\n   Indeed, humans with their **substantial bodies (yǒuxíng zhī qū)**,\n   emptying their **One Heart (yī xīn)**,\n   seize Heaven and Earth’s natural **qi**,\n   extract **metal** from the moon,\n   and interchange **water and fire**.\n   When **water and fire** refine **metal**,\n   the **Elixir (Dān)** is formed.\n   Thus, one knows that the **Dao** is the **substance of yin and yang (tǐ)**,\n   and the One is the **origin of water and fire (yuán)**.\n\n   The **Qián** essence is **metal (jīn)**,\n   sustained by **fire** for nourishment.\n   To seize its **qi**, one must not abandon the One.\n   The **moon’s initial birth** is the **arcane (pò)**,\n   without the **hun** (ethereal soul) it lacks clarity,\n   the **hun** being **fire**,\n   without embracing Oneness it is insufficient to capture the **sun’s qi (Tài yáng zhī qì)**.\n   Again, **metal and water** must be balanced and complete.\n\n   Now, instead of speaking of **water**, we speak of **fire**,\n   invoking the **sun** as **water**.\n\n   The *Fire Record* says:\n   *\"Stars arise from **sun and moon**,\n   **metal** is formed from **water and fire**.\n   Therefore, we rely on the **three luminaries (sān guāng)** for illumination.\n   The **Dao’s** application is not merely to obtain **symbols (xiàng)**;\n   even if one attains them, one must forget their forms—\n   this is its mystery.\"*\n\n2. **Guard against joy and anger.**\n   Concentrate the **qi** to achieve **softness (róu)**,\n   can one be like an infant?\n\n   The One is the **yang’s initial birth**.\n   Like a child in the womb,\n   it is guarded by **softness (róu)**,\n   hence called **concentrating the qi**.\n   The saying *\"listen to it with the qi\"* is the **Dao** of this.\n\n   The *Classic* says:\n   *\"Continuous as if it exists,\n   yet used without exertion.\n   This is the **Dao** of concentrating the **qi**.\"*\n\n   Indeed, the **yang’s** initial birth is marked by **rigidity (gāngxìng)**,\n   and one must be cautious at its beginning.\n   During the **returning phase (fāng fù)**, concentrate on **softness** to govern it;\n   as it gradually strengthens, **rigidity** grows.\n   If overdone, the **center is lost**,\n   and this is the method of achieving it.\n\n   *\"Achieving\"* means *\"taking.\"*\n   Taking **softness** to govern **rigidity**,\n   one must not lose the **harmony (hé)**.\n\n   After the full moon, **metal and water** are balanced.\n   The **upper crescent** is like a taut string—\n   straight and unyielding.\n   One must not deviate or overpower it.\n   **Harmony** arises from **nature (xìng)**,\n   nature and **emotion (qíng)** merging,\n   forming the **Dao of yin and yang**.\n\n   When **metal** receives **fire**,\n   its **substance** transforms into **Qián** (creativity),\n   **Qián** shifts to **Xùn** (wind),\n   and the **five phases** complete their cycle,\n   returning to **Kūn** (receptivity).\n   The five can nourish the One,\n   and the **mother establishes the foundation (mǔ lì pín jī)**.\n\n   The *Classic* says:\n   *\"Thus, the noble one seeks nourishment from the mother,\n   and one must not fail to concentrate on **softness**—\n   hence, like an infant without **stumbling or violence (jué bào)**.\"*\n\n3. **Profoundly understand the emptiness of forms.**\n   Purify and eliminate, observe the **mystery (xuán)**—\n   can one remain without flaw?\n\n   When the **heart (xīn)** transforms into **nature (xìng)**,\n   desires and utilitarian emotions vanish,\n   yet **nature** is hidden while the **heart** generates **delusive thoughts (wàng xiǎng)**.\n   These thoughts cling to **impurities (tú)**,\n   accumulating like sediment at the bottom.\n\n   To exhaust the **Dao’s** essence,\n   one must deeply inspect **Heaven’s mechanisms (tiān jī)**.\n   As long as external phenomena are not forgotten,\n   **evil thoughts (xié xīn)** will prevail.\n\n   Indeed, the **Great Dao** is attained through an **empty heart**,\n   thereby grasping **Heaven’s mechanisms**—\n   this is **pure and clear**, and **illuminated**.\n\n   Originally, the One arises from **non-generation (wúshēng)**,\n   not solidifying yet without means to conceal its **mystery**.\n   The **Qián** phase must derive from **Kūn** through **enlightenment (zhì chè)**,\n   and only then can one perceive the **subtle words of the Dao (wēi jù)**,\n   the **obscured desires (xī yù zhī hūn)**,\n   and the **dimness of lustful reasoning (lì yù zhī chǎn)**.\n\n   The two characters *\"purify and eliminate\"* emphasize **excavating the heart**.\n   The **function of observing the mystery** requires first forgetting oneself,\n   so that **water flows freely**,\n   the **sea’s clarity** reflects the **sky’s vastness**,\n   and **spirit is renewed like snow after a bath**.\n   **Dispelling delusion** and **clarifying the ultimate (shū míng jiù jìng)**,\n   one cannot observe the **mystery** without **Dao**,\n   and follows only the **Dao**.\n\nThis text expounds on the **Jīng** of nurturing life’s essence and **Yán Huì’s** grasp of the **heart-fasting** subtlety.\n\n**IV. The Dao of Governance Through Character**\n\n*\"To love the people and govern the realm—*\n*can one truly do so without action?\"*\n\nThe **Jīng’s** grand intent lies in governing the body, the family,\nthe realm, and the world.\nIts threads converge in the **doctrines of nature and fate**,\nwhere **Dao** cycles through **mystery and clarity**—\nwhether practiced in **unity or division**.\nIf one fails to harmonize them, they scatter.\nIf guided by **principle**, they align.\n\nThis passage first speaks of **nourishing the spirit and vital essence**,\nits logic rooted in the **sun and moon’s interplay**,\nthe **conjunction of fire’s timing**,\nthe **advance and retreat of medicines**.\nNext, it speaks of **concentrating qi to attain softness**,\n**purifying and observing the mystery**—\nall tracing back to the **origin of nature and fate**.\n\nYet suddenly it speaks of *loving the people and governing the realm*—\na shift to worldly law. How disjointed!\n\nNot so. When speaking of the self,\nthe **heart is sovereign**, the **blood and qi are the people**.\nA **pure heart and harmonized spirit** mean\nthe **honor and defense circulate freely**,\nand the **blood and qi flow in order**.\nThe **yin and yang of the four seasons**\nthen follow their natural course—\nneither hastening nor lagging.\nThis is akin to *cherishing the spirit and valuing qi*,\na **unified heart** merging with the **Dao of effortless governance**.\n\nThe *Língshū* states:\n*\"Heaven and Earth in hidden stillness,*\n*the Six Celestial Stems weave themselves.\"*\n\nThis is **Heaven’s natural way**—\n**effortless and complete**.\n\nThe **Dao of governing the world**\ntakes the people as its root.\nLove them, and they gather like children.\nBenefit them, and they come like deer.\nWith sincerity, they submit.\nWith joy, they obey.\nDo not pervert their nature,\ndo not alter their virtue.\nThus they dwell in **Ren’s domain of longevity**—\nwhere is there any *action*?\n\nHence, it aligns with **yin and yang**,\nharmonizes with **Heaven and Earth’s function**—\nwhat separation exists in governance?\n\n**V. Harmonizing the Rigid Qi**\n\n*\"The Heavenly Gate’s opening and closing—*\n*can one avoid being feminine?\"*\n\nThe soft cannot dominate the rigid,\nthe masculine cannot submit to the feminine—\nthis is **nature**.\nTo be both soft and rigid,\nto know masculinity while guarding femininity—\nthis is **Dao**.\n\nTo adhere to **nature** yet not align with **Dao**\nis not the **Sage’s way**.\n\nThe Sage’s movements merge with **Dao**,\nhis actions resonate with **Dao**.\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The Heavenly Gate has no form.\"*\n\nTo treat its *non-existence* as opening and closing\nis to overlook its feminine essence.\n\nThe **Heavenly Gate** is **Qián**.\nWhen spoken of through the **Six Qi**, it reaches **Xùn** as the Heavenly Gate.\nWhen defined by the **Eight Trigrams’ positions**, **Xū-Hài** are the Heavenly Gate,\n**Xùn** is the Earthly Door—**Kūn** itself.\n\n**Qián** at **Jǐ** is pure yang—\ntruly masculine.\nYet it resides in **Kūn’s** position—\nnever detached from femininity.\n\nAt times of rigidity, it merges with softness in **virtue**—\nis this not *being feminine*?\n\n**Xū-Hài**, **Qián’s** positions,\nfrom **Wǔ** dividing the Six Qi,\n**Hài** is pure **Kūn**.\n**Qián** in **Kūn’s** position—\nis this not *being feminine*?\n\nThis is the **natural logic of Qián and Kūn**.\n\nThus, **Xùn** in the east-south—\nwhere **yang qi** emerges—\nthe Heavenly Gate opens.\n**Qián** in the west-north—\nwhere **yin qi** enters—\nthe Heavenly Gate closes.\n\nFrom **Dōngbì** to **Sì**, **Sì** is **Wèi**,\n**Wèi** as the **Human Gate**—\nthus **Xùn** is the Earthly Door.\nNot only does this apply to **Wèi** itself.\n\nEven in human application, it holds true.\n\n**All** who speak of **ability** and **inability**—\nthis is the **transformation of nature** entering the **Dao/Way**.\n\nIndeed, **Yíng-Pò** is the **moon**,\nand **Kūn** governs the **moon**—\nis this not the **refinement of the Four Symbols** to enter the **Central Palace**?\n\nIndeed, the **Dao/Way** can give birth to things,\nand pure **yang** alone cannot generate—\nit relies upon **yin-yang**,\nand **generation** is its meaning.\nThus, one takes its **mother**.\n\nThe **Classics** say: *\"There is a named **mother** of all things—*\nthis is the **law**.\"\n\n**Yin-yang** take the **moon** as their standard,\nand within one **moon**,\nfrom **new moon** to **full moon** and then to **waning**,\n**Qián** and **Kūn** interpenetrate\nto complete their **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe first three days of the **moon**,\n**Zhèn** is reborn twice—\n**Zhèn** receives the **Gēng** talisman,\nand **Kūn** undergoes its first **transformation** into **Zhèn**.\n\nOn the eighth day, it **transforms** into **Dīng**,\nand **Kūn** undergoes its second **transformation** into **Duì**.\n\nOn the fifteenth day, it **transforms** into **Qián**,\nand on the sixteenth day, it shifts into **Xùn**—\nthe first **transformation** of **Qián**,\nand on the sixteenth day, **Xīn** emerges.\n\nOn the twenty-third day, **Qián** undergoes its second **transformation** into **Gèn**.\n\nAt **cockcrow**, **Bǐng** appears,\nand on the thirtieth day, **Jiǎ** loses its **brightness**—\n**Qián**’s third **transformation**,\nand **Kūn** **vanishes** into **Yǐ**,\nuntil it reaches **waning**.\n\nWhen **yang virtue/power** is diminished,\nit **converges** with **yang** in **Gèn**,\nand **nourishes** **yin** with **yang**—\nthe **sun** and **moon** **refine** their forms.\n\n**Yin-yang** **interact** and **deplete** each other,\nand the **moon** **obtains** its **arc** to **generate**.\nOn the **Gēng** day, it **receives** its **soul** and **announces** the **new moon**.\n\nBoth commence from **Gèn**,\nand **Gèn** is the **threshold**.\n\n**Zhuāngzǐ** says:\n*\"To enter and exit without seeing its form—*\nthis is called the **Heavenly Gate**.\"\n\nThe **Heavenly Gate** is **emptiness**.\n**Qián** and **Kūn**—\nwhen **hexagrams** are drawn, their **forms** appear,\nbut if **hexagrams** are not drawn, where are their **forms**?\n\nThe **Six Yang** are the **transformations** of **Qián qi**,\nand the **Six Yin** are the **movements** of **Kūn’s** time.\n\nWhen **Qián** **transforms** back into **Kūn**,\nwhat **Qián** remains?\nWhen **Kūn** **transforms** back into **Qián**,\nwhat **Kūn** remains?\nIf it does not **unify** its form,\nhow can it **settle** its position?\nOne **emerges**, one **enters**,\nand things **multiply** themselves.\n\nThus, all things **emerge** from **emptiness**,\n**emptiness** **contains** **emptiness** and **emptiness**—\nthe **sage** **hides** within this.\n\n**Liú**, **Tuō**, **Zhī**, **Jiàn**—\n**knowing** and **seeing** **fall away**—\nhow can one **clearly** **perceive** all four directions?\nHow can one **not** **know**?\n\n**Knowing** is **self-knowing**,\nand **seeing** is **self-seeing**.\nThose who **self-know** have **awakening**,\nand through **knowing**, they **emanate** **Heavenly Light**.\n\nThose who **self-see** have **clarity**,\nand through the **heart**, they **delve** into the **wondrous root**.\n\nTo **see** without **seeing**—\n**penetrating** and **illuminating** without obstruction.\nThis is not merely **lawlessness**,\nbut rather, **law** **pervades** all **laws**.\n\nThe **transformations** of **yin-yang**,\nthe **conjunctions** of **sun** and **moon**,\nthe **interactions** of **Qián** and **Kūn**,\nthe **emergences** and **entries** of **having** and **emptiness**—\n**comprehended** within **one mind**,\n**fully** **exhausting** their **mysteries**,\nthen one may be called **clear**.\n\n**Wisdom** lies in **self-knowing**,\nwithin **inner** **virtue/power**—\nnot in the **outer**.\n\n**Seeing** lies in **self-seeing**,\nwithin **oneself**—\nnot in **others**.\n\nIf **wisdom** is used for **scheming**,\nwhat is schemed is in **things**—\nthis is not **stealing** the **mechanism**.\n\nIf **clarity** is used for

says:\n*\"To establish **knowing** and **seeing** is to establish **ignorance**,\nand to **liberate** from **knowing** and **seeing** is to attain **True Suchness**.\"*\n\n**Keen intelligence**—\nhow can it not **be bent**?\n**Eloquence**—\nhow can it not **be forgotten**?\n\nThus, one **knows** the **heart** of the **perfected sage**—\n**knowing** yet **not speaking**,\nand **speaking** yet **not knowing**.\n\n「The **Way**’s **mystic** **application** is then summarized:\n\n1. **Application** of the **One**—its **function** lies in **things**.\n   To **generate** and to **nurture**.\n   The **Dao/Way** is what the heavens and earth **await** before **generation**,\n   what all **things** **await** before the **sun** and **moon** **manifest**.\n   The **Yang** **resonates** at the **beginning**—*\"The **Easy** [Yijing] says: 'The first emergence of all things is this,'\"*—\n   while the **Yin** **materializes** at the **end**—*\"There is no end without completion.\"*—\n   All **things** arise and transform through it,\n   thus the **Dao/Way** is the **mother** of **things**, the **generator**.\n   **Virtue/power** has the principle of **completion**—the **nurturer**.\n   Without the **Dao/Way**, there is no **generation**,\n   and without **virtue/power**, there is no **nurturing**.\n   **Nurturing** is **cultivation**.\n   Within the heavens and earth, the **Dao/Way** is the **encompassing** **cultivation**.\n   It is also said: *\"**Nurturing** is to **gather** [qi].*\n   Yet, the **Great Dao/Way** of **One**’s **nature** has already been **fulfilled**.\n   Without **virtue/power**’s **completion**, **nature** may be **impaired**.\n   This chapter, from **loading** the **vital breath** [yìng] and **vital essence** [pò] to **embracing the One**, **concentrating qi**, **purifying** [díchú], and **loving the people**,\n   all **proceed** from **action** to **non-action**.\n   Why so?\n   The heavens and earth have the **natural** **elixir** [huán’dān] **Dao/Way**,\n   while humans **follow** the **metallic fire** [jīnhuǒ].\n   By **refining** the **natural Dao/Way**, one **concludes** with **non-action**.\n   The **Celestial Gate** [Tiānmén] **opens** and **closes**—\n   **solely guarding** its **mother**,\n   **not floating**, **not moving**,\n   like one **without knowing**—\n   then the **Dao/Way** is **exhausted** here.\n\n   **Loading** the **vital breath** and **vital essence** is **generation**,\n   **completing** the **vital breath** is **nurturing**,\n   **acting** yet **reaching non-action**,\n   **knowing** yet **acting as if in ignorance**—\n   this is the **Dao/Way** of **restoring** the **whole**.\n\n   **Generating** yet **not possessing**,\n   **acting** yet **not relying**,\n   **nurturing** yet **not dominating**—\n   here lies the **function** of **non-action**.\n\n   **Non-action** is the **mystic** **application** of the **Dao/Way**.\n   The three phrases—*\"**generating** yet **not possessing**, **acting** yet **not relying**, **nurturing** yet **not dominating**\"*—\n   emphasize the **importance** of the **character** \"without knowing.\"\n\n   Those who **study** the **Dao/Way** first **value** **forgetting things**,\n   then **value** **having no mind**.\n   The **Dao/Way** of the **Golden Elixir** [jīndān]\n   **harmonizes** with the **heavenly function**.\n   Though following the **master’s teachings** [shīfǎ],\n   one must ultimately **conform** to **heaven’s operation** [Tiānxíng],\n   **not defying** its **natural principle**.\n   Yet, one **must not** **fail** to **know**,\n   nor **fail** to **apply**.\n   **Knowing** its **most vital essence** leads to **returning** to **non-knowing**,\n   **beginning** with **action** and **concluding** in **non-action**.\n\n   **Fire** **consumes** **metal**—\n   how can there be a **mind** of **taking**?\n   **Taking** is **yet not taking**.\n   Thus, *\"**generating** yet **not possessing**, **acting** yet **not relying**\"*\n   lies in the **mystic** **application** of **Yin** and **Yang**.\n   How can one **rely** on its **function**?\n   This **Dao/Way**, though **applied** through **Yin** and **Yang**,\n   its **mechanism** is **unfathomable**—\n   **Yin** and **Yang** **cannot** be **measured**.\n   *\"**Nurturing** yet **not dominating**\"*—\n   this refers to the **moon’s** **beginning** and its **fullness**,\n   why **add** a **hand**?\n   **Yang** **Xiong** said: *\"The **perfected sage** **acts** without **handling**,\n   the **perfected sage** **should** **align** with this.\"*\n\n   **Revisiting** what was said before:\n   **Not possessing** its **virtue/power**—\n   this is called **mystic virtue/power**.\n   This is said **to revisit** what came before.\n   Summarizing the **essence** of this chapter,\n   **praising** its **subtlety**:\n   The **previous** text **revealed** the **intent** of the **heavenly elixir Dao/Way**,\n   the **mechanism** of **love** and **refinement** in **bukan** [乾坤, Heaven-Earth],\n   yet **unfathomable** in its **depth**,\n   merely **conforming** to **worldly methods**—\n   how can one **know** that the **medicines** are **complete**,\n   that the **fire** and **refinement** are **without flaw**?\n   The **Dao/Way** of **creation** and **transformation** **cannot** **conceal** its **subtleties**,\n   and **body** and **application** **cannot** **emerge** beyond this.\n\n   The *Yīnxíng* [阴符, *Yin Symbol* **Sutra**) says:\n   *\"**Knowing** and **refining**, this is called the **perfected sage**.\n   It is the **mystic virtue/power**.\"*\n\n   **Shào Ruòyú** said:\n   *\"From **loading** the **vital breath** and **vital essence** to this is called **mystic virtue/power**.\n   The **heart** has **no fixed name**, **establishing** itself **according to circumstances**.\n   When the **heart** **stirs**, it **adheres** to **things**,\n   and **adhering** to **things** reveals the **heart**.\n   When the **heart** **stirs**, it **belongs** to **Yang**,\n   and is named **spirit** [shén], or also named the **heart**.\n   When the **heart** is **still**, it **belongs** to **Yin**,\n   and is named **essence** [jīng], or also named **nature** [xìng].\n   When the **heart** **turns outward**, it becomes **vision** and **hearing**,\n   and is named **soul** [hún], or also named **emotion** [qíng].\n   When the **heart** **turns inward**, it **withdraws** **vision** and **returns** **hearing**,\n   and is named **vital breath** [pò], or also named **intention** [yì],\n   all **establishing names** **according to circumstances**.\n   In total, it is named the **heart**.\n   Thus one **knows** the **heart** as the **master** **bearing** the **body**,\n   **without fail** **cultivating** [yíng].\n\n   Originally, the **vital breath** is **Yin**,\n   and **Yin** **follows** the **principle** of **stillness**.\n   The **heart** is **internal**,\n   and **stillness** allows the **vital breath** and **essence** to **settle**.\n   When the **vital breath** and **essence** **settle**,\n   then the **spirit** and **soul** **settle**.\n   The **spirit**, **essence**, **soul**, and **vital breath**—\n   **blended** and **harmonized** into **One**, called **embracing the One**.\n\n   Though **embracing the One** can **adjust** the **Two Qi** [liǎngyì, Yin-Yang] at the **Yellow Dao/Way** [Huángdào],\n   and **unite** the **Two Natures** [liǎngxìng] at the **Primordial Palace** [Yuāngōng],\n   **concentrating** the **Five Phases** [wǔxíng] and **harmonizing** the **Four Symbols** [sìxiàng]—\n   this is the **technique** of **longevity**,\n   yet **not ultimate** in the **Dao/Way**,\n   because the **heart** **adheres** to **One** [object].\n\n   **Lǎozǐ** sighed and said: *\"Can one **not depart** from it?\n   **Departing** from **having** and **entering** **non-having**,\n   **emptying** the **heart** to **clarity** and **stillness**.\n   Initially it was called **non-action**,\n   this is the name of **true heart**,\n   the **Great Dao/Way**.\n   Like **concentrating qi** and **governing softness** [zhìróu],\n   once **concentrating qi** is spoken of,\n   this **application** **depends** on the **heart**.\n   With the **heart**, one **cannot** **achieve softness**,\n   can it be **like** an **infant** **without heart**?\n   If **purifying** all **realms**,\n   **one heart** **beholding** the **mystic**,\n   like **jade** **having a flaw**,\n   can one **with heart** **cling** to the **mystic**,\n   yet **not** **be free** of **flaws**?\n   The **heart** of **loving the people** and **governing the state**,\n   **cultivating** the **affairs** of the **world**,\n   **manifest** in **traces**,\n   with **traces** comes **worry**,\n   yet **can** it **display** in **benevolence** [rén],\n   **conceal** in **application**,\n   and **still** **achieve non-action**?\n\n   The **gate** of **natural** **mechanism** and **understanding**,\n   the **heart** is this.\n   **Opening** and **closing** to **respond** to **circumstances**,\n   can it **follow** the **nature** of **things** and **emotions**,\n   and **act** as **feminine** [cī]?\n   The **heart** is originally **pure** and **clear**,\n   **white** and **unobstructed** in all **directions**,\n   yet **stained** by **knowing** and **seeing**,\n   **emotional** **entanglements** **reaching** **obstruction**,\n   unable to **be empty** and **still**—\n   can it **be free** of **knowing** and **seeing**?\n\n   The **One** is the **root** of **clinging** and **wandering**,\n   the **source** of **generation** and **extinction**.\n   Once **clinging** to **One** [object] **persists**,\n   it is **not** the **Dao/Way** of **non-action**.\n   To **depart** from the **trace** of **embracing the One**,\n   only then does it **align** with **mystic virtue/power**.\n   **Mystic virtue/power** is **generating** and **nurturing**,\n   **generating** yet **not seen** in **action**,\n   **virtue/power** yet **not seen** in **relying**,\n   **nurturing** to **completion** yet **not dominating**—\n   this is called **mystic virtue/power**.\n   Hence, **Zhuāngzǐ** said: *\"**Penetrating** the **One**, all **affairs** are **completed**.\n   If **without heart** one **attains** the **One**, then **ghosts** and **spirits** **respond**.\n   This is what is meant.\"*\n\nKing Zhìrán said: *\"To bear the **spirit-soul** (*yíngpò*) until this is called **mystic virtue/power**.*\n\nThe **Perfect Person** (*zhìrén*) takes **embracing one’s innate nature** and **harboring the spirit** as the sequence of entering the **Dao/Way**, and **stillness** and **non-action** as the application of embodying the **Dao/Way**.\n\nNow, to bear the **spirit-soul** (*yíngpò*)—its **substance** is **yin-stillness**, its **function** is **gentle submission**. To **control** and **guide** it properly requires the **yang-spirit** (*hún*) as its complement. The **spirit-soul** (*pò*) depends on form to achieve stillness, yet cannot move on its own. The **spirit** (*hún*) rides the form to move, yet cannot still itself. Their **separation** and **union** occur naturally, with the **spirit** (*shén*) as their sovereign—just as a chariot needs wheels. Though the hub and spokes are present, how could it move without a **chariot**? When the **chariot** is not in use, yet when it is used, for an instant it cannot be separated from it.\n\nThus, it is said: *‘Can one embrace the One without separation?’*\n\nLet us examine this: **Spirit** not unified is called **emptiness** (*wǎng*), **essence** not unified is called **duality** (*liǎng*). From **things** one falls into **emptiness-duality**—what **spirituality** remains?\n\nIndeed, because humans with life do not understand this **Dao/Way**, they lose their own **spirituality**. By the time they begin to move their hands and feet, their **essence** dissipates, their **spirit-soul** (*húnpò*) drifts away. The **spirit** (*hún*) must scatter with **perception** into the void, while the **spirit-soul** (*pò*) sinks with the corpse into the earth. All fail to return to their **true nature**—this cannot be compared to the saying of **stillness as returning to one’s original nature**.\n\nShī Jiānwú said: *\"When **essence** abides, **qi** abides; when **qi** abides, **spirit** departs.\"* **Zhuāngzǐ** said: *\"When **essence** is complete, **qi** is complete; when **qi** is complete, **spirit** is complete; when **spirit** is complete, the **Dao/Way** is complete.\"* When these three are complete, it is called **restoring form and essence**, **unifying form and spirit**, all perfectly aligning with the **Dao/Way**. Yet those who long for **true heart-mind** and **resolve**—why do they not naturally emit **heavenly radiance**?\n\nThere are those with the **heart** to learn the **Dao/Way** but lacking the **nature** to learn it; there are those with the **nature** to learn the **Dao/Way** but lacking the **heart** to learn it. Those who fear what they lose have already lost the **root** of **calming the heart** and **nurturing nature**.\n\nThus, **Lǎozǐ** posed the question: *\"Can you concentrate your **qi** and soften like an infant? Can you keep **joy** and **anger** from showing on your face, **likes** and **dislikes** from entering your heart? When all **phenomena** confront you, you forget them—no dust of **attachment** arises. What **flaws** remain?*\n\nThe **body** is like a **state**; the **state** is like the **body**. One has never heard of the **body** being governed yet the **state** not governed, or the **state** governed yet the **body** not governed. It begins with **action** and ends with **non-action**. Though externally one may be indifferent to the **outcomes of action**, internally one must preserve the **root of non-action**.\n\nThus, it is said: *‘To love the people and govern the state—can one do so without non-action?’*\n\nThe *Great Clinging* (*Dà Yì*) takes **Heaven** and **Earth** as gateways; the **valley-spirit** (*gǔshén*) takes the **mysterious female** (*xiánpò*) as its gateway. **Heaven** and **Earth**, **yin** and **yang**—their **rolling**, **unfolding**, **opening**, and **closing**, their **emerging**, **entering**, **expanding**, and **contracting**—never fail their **timing**. The human body, too, does not fail to embody the **functions of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang**. Always in harmony with **Heaven**, never defying it; always yielding to **things**, never preceding them.\"*\n\nThus it is said: *\"When the Heavenly gate opens and closes, can one not be like the mysterious female?*\n**Pliancy and wisdom**—these are the true accomplishments of the **noble man** (*dàzhàngfū*). When he is **enlightened**, he **saves all within the Dao**; when he **applies** them, they **manifest**; when he **conceals** them, they **remain hidden**. He does not **transpose** anger, nor does he **repeat** faults.\n\n**Abundant virtue and sage appearance**—yet throughout the day he acts as though **foolish**. Among the **Confucian disciples**, only **Yan Yuan** (*Yán Yuān*) truly attained this. To **discard** pliancy and **abandon** the body, to **separate** from form and **lose** wisdom, and thus **harmonize** with the **Great Unification** (*Dàtōng*).\n\n**Great brightness** seems like **shame**; the **Dao** revealed appears as though **obscured**. Thus it is said: *‘When clarity is fourfold, can one not be without knowledge?’*\n\nIf so, then all **virtues and wondrous actions** are fully **possessed** by me—this is to **assist the Creator** in its **functions**. The **Dao** gives birth to ten thousand things; its **abiding** in me is such.\n\nTo **nurture** and **cherish** them—what difficulty is there? To **give birth** and **fulfill** their **nature**, to **cherish** and **exhaust** their **nourishment**, without **partial love** or **selfish gain**, so **giving birth** is not **possessive**. Without **self-praise** or **self-denigration**, so **action** is not **self-reliant**. Without **petty cleverness** or **trickery**, so **long** does he **endure** without **being slain**.\n\nHis **benefits and blessings** flow to all ages, yet he does not **claim** them as his own—**merits** cover the **world**, yet he **seems** not to **boast**. Who could **attain** and **name** him?\n\n**Magnificent indeed!** The **Dao** suffices to **benefit things**; **virtue** suffices to **benefit people**; **action** suffices to **benefit oneself**, yet again he does not **possess**, does not **rely** upon himself, nor does he **boast** of his own. This is called **human semblance yet Heavenly**—**Heavenly virtue** is profound, distant, vast, and great.\n\n**Man** is **equal** to **Heaven**—yet why not call it **Mysterious Virtue**?\n\n*Moral and True Scriptures of the Dao and Virtue: Volume Fifteen ends, Volume Sixteen begins.*\n\n**Chapter on Nourishing the Vital Essence**\n\nMaster Yinyuan, whose profound virtue traverses the Mysterious Path, oversees the compilation of affairs.\nSifu Liu Weiyong assembles the text.\nFormerly honored official Ding Yidong, Director of the Imperial Treasury and Compiler of the Secretariat, verifies the text.\n\n**On Nourishing the Vital Essence:**\n\nHuang Maocai says:\n*\"Can one who nourishes the vital essence and embraces unity ever separate?\"*\n**Vital essence**—this is motion.\n**Spirit**—this is yin.\nYin belongs to form; form, by nature, cannot move. Yet **qi** bears it and sets it in motion.\nWhen a person cultivates and directs **qi** so it never departs from form, this is called *embracing unity*.\nIt is not spoken of as **qi** because only this can sustain life—there is no second way.\n\n**Concentrating qi to achieve softness—can one be like an infant?**\nHaving embraced unity, over time one naturally forgets form and focuses solely on nurturing **qi**, hence form is not mentioned. What ordinary people contend for is the burden of form.\nTo forget one’s form and return to the state of an infant means no breath of strife remains—thus it is called *achieving softness*.\nSoftness is the companion of life.\n\n**Purifying and gazing into the Mysterious—can one be without blemish?**\nBy this stage, both form and **qi** are forgotten.\nWashing the heart clean, exhausting all filth, equal to the boundless void—how could there still be blemish?\n\n**Loving the people and governing the state—can one act without doing?**\nTo study the Dao and reach *wuwei* is not the work of a single day.\nOnly after embracing unity, achieving softness, and gazing into the Mysterious without blemish can one attain *wuwei*.\nIf one has not yet reached this and yet forces oneself to *wuwei*, this is called *riding at a gallop*—ever more distant from the Dao.\nThe state is like the body; the people are like the spirit. Loving the people and governing the state is the same as tending to oneself.\n\n**The Heavenly Gate opening and closing—can one avoid the feminine?**\nThe Heavenly Gate is the **fontanel**.\nNow, the infant’s fontanel opens and closes uncontrollably. When cultivation reaches this stage, one can ascend to communicate with Heavenly Dao—thus it is called the Heavenly Gate.\n**Feminine** is the same as **yin**.\n\n**Clarity and openness in all directions—can one avoid knowing?**\nTo be without knowing is to know all things, like a person opening their eyes to see—nothing is unseen.\nHow could one say, *\"I have perception\"*? To have perception and lack perception is called *eye disease*.\nTo have knowing and not knowing is called *heart disease*.\nFrom embracing unity, six stages progress until one reaches *wuwei*—thus, Kexue questioned Wangni four times, and four times Wangni answered, *\"I do not know.\"* Kexue then leapt for joy—there was good reason.\n\n**To nurture life to this point is called Mysterious Virtue.**\nThe Classic speaks of this twice.\nThe first mention refers to the **Dao**; this refers to **virtue**.\nThe **Dao** descends as **virtue**; the subtlest **virtue** merges once more with the **Dao**—thus it is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\nProgram Tai said:\n*\"Can one who nourishes the vital essence and embraces unity ever separate?\"*\nUnity is the name that encompasses all things.\nWhen joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are about to emerge but have not yet formed,\nWhen wisdom and insight are about to manifest but have not yet taken shape—\nAll these are unified into One, refined and without separation, returning to the origin where the **Dao** first emerges as One.\nThe **Dao** is One alone.\nTo ground the **Dao** in affairs and name what can be called **virtue** is already distinct from the **Dao**.\nFrom the **virtue** one attains, one divides it into *ren, yi, li, zhi, xin* to name it—\nThe source grows distant, and the branches multiply beyond count.\nEarlier, it was spoken of as a unified whole; now it is divided into five, and their offspring are innumerable.\nThus, Laozi thins it out, saying:\n*\"When the **Dao** is lost, **virtue** arises; when **virtue** is lost, *ren, yi, li* arise.\"*\nWhen he says *\"lost,\"* he does not mean *gone*—\nRather, moving away from the root, the commandments multiply, ever more contrary to Unity.\nThus, what Laozi most treasures is the subtle, indistinct, and undifferentiated origin.\nYet Yi Yin, speaking of his attainment, places it in the realm of **virtue**, harmony, and accord.\nExamining beginning and end, all conform to Unity as their standard.\n\nLiezi’s theory is like a lost sheep with many paths:\n*\"Only by returning to Unity and merging can one avoid gain or loss.\"*\nZhuangzi says, *\"**Virtue** is the totality of what the **Dao** encompasses.\"*\nUnity is called *totality*; merging is called *returning*.\nBoth stem from the restoration of the Mandate—\nThus, cultivating the **Dao** must begin with embracing Unity.\n\nThe human spirit and **qi** are called *hun* and *po*.\nThe moon’s substance, which does not receive sunlight, is also called *po*.\nThis **vital essence** and **spirit** are the *young hun* and *po* paired in opposition from the *Yijing*.\nThe *young hun* can ascend and descend lightly, entering and exiting freely.\nBut the *po*’s **vital essence** is like encampment, gathering, and clustering—\nYet it is bound and constrained, unable to govern its own movement.\nThus, the ascent or descent of spirit and form is the most critical mechanism of the body.\nIf the spirit governs the form, all actions follow its will—\nIf the spirit does not reign, it is instead bent by the form, and decay follows.\nNow, let the spirit be the chariot, the form the load—\nThe chariot moves, and the load is borne upon it—\nThis is the spirit already governing the form.\nIf a person achieves this, their will directs the form like a chariot moving its load—\nDesire east, and it goes east; desire west, and it goes west—\nWhatever is willed, there is compliance, no resistance.\nTo embrace Unity from here is not difficult.\nIt is only that one does not know whether, in governing the form and embracing Unity, one can persist without abandoning it.\n\nThus, the hesitant tone—this is doubt.\nUsing doubtful language to examine the superficial—\nIt is to make one reflect upon themselves.\nHence, Zhuangzi’s discussion of the *Yashengjing* says:\n*\"Can one embrace Unity? Can one avoid loss?\"*\nThis is the very meaning.\n\nAll this chapter speaks to those who have glimpsed the **Dao** but whose guardianship is not yet firm.\nIf one embraces Unity and does not separate,\nAchieves softness and is like an infant—\nThen one is already One with the **Dao**.\nIf Laozi were to speak from this ground,\nThe doubtful language would become decisive.\n\n「凡此章下文设疑以示者，其义皆类此也。\nTo embrace Unity and achieve softness—can one persist like a newborn babe? The *Liezi* describes the infant thus: *\"Qi is focused and harmonized to its utmost.\"*\nNothing harms it, no virtue can surpass it—this speaks of its innate thickness, untainted by external things.\nMencius says: *\"The noble person is one who does not lose the heart of their infant self.\"*\nThis means though they engage with the world, they do not forget their original nature.\n\nCombining both, only those whose virtue remains unseparated can truly return to the state of the infant.\nWhen one is about to act, their *qi* carries out their intentions as if wind conveys the chill and heat of seasons.\nIf one’s *qi* is not diverted elsewhere, and they focus solely on achieving softness,\nThen when this softness is attained, the harmonized state that harms nothing returns once more.\nIt is only that one does not know whether they can reach this state.\n\nTo purify and perceive the profound—can one remain without flaw?\nThe profound is that which is deep and unfathomable.\n*Xuànpín* (玄牝), *Xuàndé* (玄德), *Xuàntóng* (玄同), and *Xuànguān* (玄览) all describe this unfathomable realm.\nTo perceive the profound is to gaze within the dark and see the luminous.\nThis kind of perception, all have it—yet if the heart’s source is unclean,\nAnd one’s mind wanders with external things,\nThen the senses are obscured, and how can the luminous be seen?\n\nNánróng Zī asked Laozi: *\"What is the difference between the eye and its form?\nYet the blind cannot see themselves.\"*\nLaozi briefly illuminated the nature of innate disposition and emotions to awaken him,\nAnd Zī thus retreated to his dwelling, called forth what he loved,\nAnd banished what he hated—\nAfter ten days, he returned to see Laozi.\nLaozi praised his ability to purify himself.\n\nZī’s question concerned vision, yet what Laozi taught was about innate disposition and emotions.\nIf Zī could purify his disposition and emotions,\nThen the obscurations would vanish on their own, and he would recover his original nature.\nThus, to purify and perceive the profound is not to exert oneself upon the eyes.\nTo investigate why obscurations arise and then purify them,\nThen all that can be seen and known will return to its original state.\nReturning to the original, one’s perception of the profound will be restored.\n\nTo love the people and govern the state—can one act without doing?\nLoving the people and governing the state must involve means to execute,\nAnd only then can intentions bear fruit—\nYet all establishing laws and affairs are but these means.\nIf one has means yet still warns against deliberate action,\nZhuangzi has already made this clear.\nHe said: *\"I have heard of nurturing the world, but never of governing it.\"*\nIn the way of nurturing, one discards cleverness,\nSets aside rewards and punishments,\nFollows the natural flow of life and disposition,\nAnd finds ease in effortless harmony—\nThus, all things are not burdened.\n\nThere is one who transcends the rules and measures of law and order.\nThis is what is called *wuwei* (无为).\n\nThus, those who strive to follow the established ways cannot,\nAnd those who seek governance through deliberate action often fail in many matters.\nHence, the warning here is like asking: *\"Who can love the people and govern the state\nWithout resorting to contrived schemes and actions?\"*\nTo act in accordance with nature, without deliberate intervention,\nIs the very essence of the next chapter’s governance—\nAs vast as simmering fresh meat.\n\nThe opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate—can one avoid bias?\nZhuangzi once pointed to the realm of birth and death, existence and nonexistence,\nAs the Heavenly Gate—\nThis is the Heavenly Gate of Heaven.\nHe also discussed the Dao that cannot be spoken or transmitted:\n*\"If one’s heart rejects it, the Heavenly Gate will not open.\"*\nThis also speaks of the human heart as the Heavenly Gate.\n\nSince the Heavenly Gate of Heaven is the realm of birth and transformation,\nThen the human Heavenly Gate is also the passage of their innate vitality.\nThe Creator’s contraction and expansion of yin and yang,\nTheir successive nurturing of birth and transformation,\nIs the ability to regulate the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate.\nIf one’s engagement with the world is cautious,\nPreserving life and death through moderation,\nJudging what is appropriate and welcoming or rejecting accordingly,\nThen the Heavenly Gate of one’s self\nCan also regulate its opening and closing.\n\nCultivating to this degree is already to surpass the world and reveal its essence—\nYet to act only when appropriate, never leading the way of things,\nIs not this even more excellent?\n\nClarity and openness in all directions—can one avoid knowing?\nClarity means no obstruction, whiteness means no darkness.\nTo be open in all directions is to have no closed doors or blind spots—\nAll four ways are thoroughly illuminated.\nThe distant lies beyond the eight extremes,\nThe near is within the space between one’s eyebrows—\nIf there is a distinct sound that comes to disturb me,\nI must know it—\nThis is the clarity and openness that reaches in all directions.\n\nWhen one attains this state, the danger lies in being too sharp in applying wisdom.\nWithout affairs, one becomes overly observant;\nEncountering affairs, one becomes too probing.\nYet if one has attained the Dao, this is not so.\nThey have never deliberately sought to see—\nYet seeing arises from the things themselves.\nThe wisdom of divining from tortoise shells,\nThe clarity of the water mirror,\nAre all its manifestations.\n\nIf one’s cultivation has not yet reached this state,\nThen even with keen intelligence and sharp insight,\nThey may guard it with foolishness—\nCould one not expose their own nature?\n\nTo nurture and accumulate life.\nOriginally, there is nothing—yet through creation, something arises—\nThus, it can be called *shēng* (生).\nLike the Dao giving rise to Unity, and Unity to Duality.\nTo take what has already been born and solidify it,\nIs to *chù* (畜) it.\nAs when one cultivates their virtue.\n\nNearly all the teachings in this chapter,\nFrom embracing Unity and achieving softness onward,\nAre about holding fast to virtue and seeking to return to the Dao.\nThe pursuit of Unity, softness, and elemental clarity is through virtue—\nTo hope for no separation and no flaw is to seek return to the Dao.\nThe methods of focusing *qi* and purifying obscurations,\nAre all ways to attain virtue.\nIf one attains virtue, one can nurture life—\nUnity, softness, and elemental clarity—\nDo they come to me?\nIf they dwell, then I am the one who can accumulate them.»\n\n「Ren arises from filial piety and fraternal respect,\nTrust arises from what is desirable—\nBoth are what is called *shēng* (生).\n\nRen has already arisen,\nYet there is a way to delight in it,\nSo that it does not abandon virtue.\nTrust has already been established,\nYet there is a way to fulfill it,\nAnd when it reaches reality, it is *shēng* (生),\nAnd then to *chù* (畜) it—\nThat is what is meant.\n\nTo *shēng* (生) without possession,\nIs the original *wú* (無).\nYet I am the one who brings forth *shēng* (生),\nAnd yet I do not stir to claim it as my own—\nThis is the lofty aspiration of those who embody the Dao.\n\nWhat was spoken of before as *shēng* (生) and *chù* (畜) to attain virtue,\nIs now spoken of as *bù-yǒu* (不有)—\nTo possess yet appear as though not possessing,\nTo be real yet appear as though empty,\nTo not dwell upon what has been attained.\n\nTo act yet not rely upon it.\nAs Zhuangzi said: *\"When one is in harmony yet does not claim self-possession, one does not rely upon it.\"*\n\nTo grow yet not dominate.\nTo rise above and yet silently guide,\nTo not reveal the means of one's governance.\nIf one truly entrusts without dominating,\nThen who shall wield its reins?\nThis is called *Xuán Dé* (玄德).\n\nWhat was spoken of before as the eight *shēng* (生) and eight *yí* (疑),\nWas because they feared one could not yet *bù-yǒu* (不有).\nIf one could firmly grasp all eight,\nThen one’s virtue would be complete.\n\nTo complete these eight virtues,\nAnd yet further them with *bù-yǒu* (不有), *bù-shì* (不恃), and *bù-zǎi* (不宰),\nThen one’s virtue becomes profound and unfathomable—\nThus, when comparing it to all virtues,\nThis alone is called *Xuán* (玄).\n\nVirtue is the Dao manifested in affairs,\nNot separate from the Dao itself.\nTo say one loses the Dao and then attains virtue,\nIs to dislike the traces of its manifestation—\nIf the highest virtue is not virtue,\nThen its advancement is hidden and deep.\n\nThus, whenever one speaks of *Xuán Dé* (玄德),\nIts name does not stray from *Dé* (德),\nYet its depth equals that of the Dao itself.\nZhuangzi posed the question to Sun Xian and Bian Que:\n*\"The Perfect One forgets their liver and gallbladder,\nDiscards their ears and eyes,\nLost in the world yet drifting beyond dust and filth,\nFree in the realm of no affairs—\nThis is called acting yet not relying upon it,\nGrowing yet not dominating.*\n\nNow you adorn your wisdom to astonish the simple,\nRefine your conduct to expose the impure,\nShining brightly like one displaying the sun and moon—\nHow shall you avoid the resentment of Heaven?\n\nIf one follows your way of displaying the sun and moon,\nAnd instead reflects inward to seek its source,\nThen the realm of *Xuán Dé* (玄德) may be glimpsed.\n\nIn discussing the later chapter’s words—\nThat the Dao *shēng* (生) and virtue *chù* (畜)—\nAnd further elaborating on *bù-yǒu* (不有), *bù-shì* (不恃), and *bù-zǎi* (不宰),\nThis is the repeated and detailed exposition of this chapter.\n\nYet there are differences—\nThis chapter speaks of virtue and Dao within the person,\nWhile the later chapter speaks of their mutual possession by humanity.\n\nThus, when Laozi’s words encompass Heaven, Earth, and the Sage,\nSometimes he does not distinguish them,\nSpeaking broadly to show that Heaven and humanity share no different aim—\nThis is the general pattern of his book.\n\nOne cannot say that when speaking of Heaven, he speaks only of Heaven,\nOr that when speaking of humanity, he speaks only of humanity.\n\nJú Zǐyáng said:\n*\"Qu Yǔ’s words about the spirit and the corporeal form\nOriginate from Laozi’s teachings.\nAnd Yáng Xióng further expounded upon his words,\nIllustrating the waxing and waning of the moon—\nThough the matters they describe differ,\nThe intent behind their compositions is the same.*\n\nYet those who interpret these three texts\nCannot harmonize their meanings.\nThus, I now combine them to discuss,\nHoping that this may suffice to clarify them.\"*\n\nThe essence lies in the term *zài* (載), which carries the meaning of \"bearing\" or \"supporting\" by vehicle—this is the common usage of antiquity and the present world.\n\nWhen it comes to a person ascending a carriage and being borne, the ancient texts and histories frequently employ this same term.\nFor instance, the *Hàn Jì* (漢紀) says, *\"Liú Zhāng followed the envoy and was borne\"* (劉章從謁者與載),\nand the *Hán Jì* (韓集) says, *\"Women carried the young child\"* (婦人以孺子載).\nThese are all of the same intent.\n\nYet in the words of these three masters today,\nthe meaning of the character *zài* is likewise so.\n\nBut **Lǎozǐ** and **Qū Zǐ** speak of the human spirit,\nand thus their term *yíng* (營) shares the same character as *yíng* (荧), meaning\nthe luminous brilliance of a crystal’s clarity.\nTheir term *pò* (魄) is much like what I have expounded upon in my discussion of the *Jiǔ Gē* (九歌)—\nthe spirit’s essence.\n\n**Yáng Zǐ** (杨子) speaks of the luminosity of the sun and moon,\nand thus takes the moon’s substance as *pò* (魄),\nwhile the sun’s radiance is *hún* (魂).\n\nWhen speaking of the human spirit,\ntheir intent is that the *hún* (魂) is the active yang fire,\nwhile the *pò* (魄) is the tranquil yin water,\nthe *hún* being twofold and the *pò* singular.\nHence, they say, *\"Bearing the yíng (營) and embracing the pò (魄),*\n*how could it depart?\"*\nThey mean that the *hún* (魂) reinforces the *pò* (魄),\nthe active sustains the tranquil,\nthe fire presses the water,\nthe two guard the one—\nand thus they do not separate.\n\nWhen a person ascends a carriage and is borne,\nbeing carried above, the *hún* (魂) is tranquil while the *pò* (魄) is clear,\nthe fire does not wither, nor the water overflow—\nthis is indeed the vital principle for longevity and enduring vision.\n\nThough **Qū Zǐ**’s words are not fully detailed,\nfrom his phrases *\"without slipping, the hún (魂) is steadfast;\nempty, to await it,\"*\none may infer that his meaning aligns with this explanation beyond doubt.\n\nWhen speaking of the sun and moon,\nthey say that the sun’s light bears upon the moon’s *pò* (魄),\nilluminating it—\njust as a person ascending a carriage is borne above.\n\nThus, *\"Before the full moon, the moon is borne in the west\"* (月未望，則載魄於西);\n*\"After the full moon, the hún (魂) remains in the east\"* (既望，則終魂於東).\n\nWhen tracing to the sun,\nthey say that as the moon waxes,\nthe sun’s light bears upon the *pò* (魄) in the west,\ngradually filling the east,\nuntil it reaches the full moon and then returns to its original state.\n\nAnd when the moon wanes,\nthe sun’s light remains to guard the *pò* (魄) in the east,\ngradually diminishing the west,\nuntil it reaches the dark moon and then fully departs.\n\nThe moon thus follows the sun for its illumination—\nbefore the full moon, the sun is on its right;\nafter the full moon, the sun is on its left.\nHence, it receives light from its respective position,\nas the people turn toward the ruler’s transformation to form customs.\n\nThough these three masters speak of two distinct matters,\ntheir discussion of *zài pò* (載魄) shares the same meaning in their texts.\nThus, alchemical scriptures and Daoist practices all employ the *nà jiǎ* (納甲) method—\nmutually supplementing each other to elucidate their principles,\nfor their fundamental logic is not truly divergent.\n\nBut those who expound upon them\nfail to delve deeply into their meaning.\n\nTo speak as the Master of the Yellow River did,\nwhen he said that Laozi took *yíng* (营) as *hún* (魂),\nthis is not the literal meaning of the characters,\nyet he further claimed that people ride upon *hún* and *pò* (魄)\nto obtain life, and should cherish and nourish them—\nthen he has lost the true intent of the text.\nOnly when considering the meaning of *zài* (载)\nas roughly \"to carry\" does he come somewhat close.\nYet this still fails to remedy the many deficiencies in his interpretation.\n\nIf Wang Fu-si took *zài* (载) to mean \"to dwell,\"\nand said that *yíng* (营) and *pò* (魄)\nare the places where people commonly reside,\nthen this also aligns with the Master of the Yellow River’s view.\nBut in recent times, the teachings of Su Shi and Wang Yuanze emerged,\nwhose lifelong theories differed like water and fire,\nyet both held that *hún* (魂) is the spiritual essence,\nwhile *pò* (魄) is mere physical substance,\nand sought to make the spiritual essence perpetually ride upon *pò* (魄) to act—\nnot to let the spiritual essence be borne by *pò* (魄).\nHong Qing-shan, in his commentary on this text,\nalso said that when *yángqì* (阳气) fills *pò* (魄),\nit becomes *húnpò* (魂魄), and if it can move,\nthen life is complete.\nHis intent is also like that of Su and Wang,\nall taking *zài* (载) to mean \"to bear as a carriage carries a person.\"\nThis not only contradicts the original meaning,\nbut if taken thus, it would force the spiritual essence to labor constantly,\nwhile *pò* (魄) never gains respite.\nThough it may avoid the burden of material desire’s entanglement,\nthe profound mystery of the spiritual essence’s unity\nis instead seized by overbearing *yáng* (阳),\nand driven to race through the chaotic, tumultuous path of worldly distractions—\nultimately falling into the realm of common injury to life and loss of vitality,\nwithout even knowing it.\nHow does this compare to the views of the two masters?\n\nIf one speaks of Yangzi’s interpretation,\nthen all take *zài* (载) to mean \"to dwell,\"\nwhich already strays from its true indication.\nLi Gu’s explanation of *hún* (魂) as *guāng* (光) is even more absurd,\nuntil Lai Guan and Sima Gong realized its error.\nYet then they sought to correct *pò* (魄) as *bì* (胐),\nwhich also failed to deeply examine the meaning of *zài* (载),\nand thus erred even further.\n\nOnly in recent years did Wang Bo-zhao suggest\nthat before the full moon, *hún* (魂) is borne by *míng* (明),\nseeming to grasp its meaning.\nThen he further said that after the full moon,\n*míng* (明) is borne to its end by *pò* (魄),\nbut this should read \"to its end\" for *míng* (明),\nnot \"to bear *pò* (魄) to its end.\"\nBy this reasoning, it seems he also reverses the original meaning of the first clause,\nfalling into the same mistake as Su and Wang—\nto bear from below upward.\nIn essence, later readers of the ancients’ texts,\nunable to delve deeply,\nrepeatedly seek their original meaning,\nyet hastily impose their own interpretations,\nleading to such reckless explanations.\nWorse yet, those who read *Chu Ci* (楚辞) merely indulge in its superficial brilliance,\nleast of all probing its profound depths.\nTherefore, I have set forth this clarification,\nhoping that those who peruse it may reflect upon it.\nThis may serve as a small aid in tracing the currents back to their sources.\n\nZhān Qiūpǔ said:\nTo bear and nurture *pò* (魄) until this point is called *xuán dé* (玄德, \"Mysterious Virtue\").\nIn *\"The Chapter of Ability\"* (《能为章》), it is said that when a person can take from the state of *wúzhī* (無知, \"no-knowing\") and *wúcī* (無雌, \"no-femaleness\"),\nthey can then forget their beginning and end in the state of *wúshì* (無事, \"no-affairs\").\nThose who broadly extend love and benevolence to settle the people and govern the state—\nI can make them unaware of where these virtues originate.\n\nHeaven is *xuán* (玄, \"Mysterious\").\nFemaleness is *pǐn* (牝, \"vulva\").\nWhen the *tiānmén* (天門, \"Heavenly Gate\") opens and closes,\nit can prevent *pò* (魄) from responding like a female to sounds and harmonizing in disorder.\nOnce this mind is already clear and open in all directions,\nit can extinguish all knowledge,\nand remain at peace from beginning to end.\nThus, one can do without doing and yet be able to do all things.\n\nZhang Chōngyìng said:\nTo bear and nurture *pò* (魄) while embracing *yī* (一, \"Oneness\") until this point is called *xuán dé* (玄德, \"Mysterious Virtue\").\nThe *hún* (魂, \"ethereal soul\") belongs to the liver,\nwhile *pò* (魄, \"corporeal soul\") belongs to the lungs.\nThe *hún* is formed from Heaven’s *qì* (炁),\nwhile the *pò* is formed from Earth’s essence.\nA person’s body contains and nurtures their *hún* while guarding their *pò*;\nif one can embrace the pure and unified essence-*qì* of Heaven and Earth,\ninteracting harmoniously without contradiction,\nthen by refining *qì* and softening essence,\nthe essence transforms into *qì*,\nas *yīn* (陰) wanes and *yáng* (陽) flourishes—\nthe *pò* becomes tranquil, the *hún* becomes clear.\nWithin, it is serene as a newborn babe;\nall filth is cleansed, nothing is mixed.\nEars are sharp, eyes are bright—\nwhat one perceives is profound.\nHow could there be any flaw or illness in the body?\n\nExtending this principle to governance,\nif one aligns with the essence of *wǒ* (我, \"self\")\nand cultivates the *qì* of the people,\nthen loving the people and governing the state will naturally possess an ineffable efficacy.\n\nConversely, if practiced in reverse:\nwhen the *tiānmén* (天門, \"Heavenly Gate\") opens,\nall orifices remain unobstructed,\nand *cīpò* (雌魄, \"feminine *pò*\") transforms into *xióngqì* (雄炁, \"masculine *qì*\"),\nso that *cīpò* cannot bring chaos.\nWhen the *dìhù* (地户, \"Earthly Portal\") opens subtly,\ntransformation occurs without words,\nand clarity spreads universally—\npeople become unknowable.\nThus it is said:\n*\"To generate and nurture\"*—\nonce true *qì* (真炁) is generated,\nit must then be further nurtured.\n*\"To generate but not possess\"*—\nonce *qì* is generated,\nit must not be depleted or wasted.\n*\"To act but not rely\"*—\nonce essence transforms into *qì*,\none must not arrogantly harm it.\n*\"To lengthen but not dominate\"*—\nit must be generated and then nourished,\nand then further protected—\ndo not slaughter the *qì* and harm its growth.\nThus, its mystery—I have attained it—\nthis is called *xuán dé* (玄德, \"Mysterious Virtue\").\n\nZhang Língyìng said:\nA person’s body contains\nHeaven’s *yī* (一, \"One\"), giving rise to *yuánqì* (元炁, \"Original *qì*\"),\nand Earth’s *yī* (一, \"One\"), giving rise to *yuánjīng* (元精, \"Original Essence\").\nAt the *zǐ* hour (子, midnight), *yī yáng* (一陽, \"One Yang\") first stirs,\nand at the *wǔ* hour (午, noon), *yī yīn* (一陰, \"One Yin\") first emerges.\nIf one grasps this,\nessence will not be lost, *qì* will not be diminished—\nhow could the spirit not be at peace?\nTo store essence and nurture *wú* (無, \"Non-being\"),\nthe practice lies in the gradual ascent and descent of the *zǐ* and *wǔ* hours,\nholding steady while embracing it—\nentering gradually, naturally accumulating success day by day.\n\nBái Yùxiān said:\nTo bear and nurture *pò* (魄).\nTo settle the heart and embrace *yī* (一, \"Oneness\").\nTo be able to remain undivided.\n\n「Where does one depart and where does one return?\nTo focus the *qi* and attain softness.\nTo purify the clear and eliminate all impurities.\nCan one be like an infant?\nMixed and undivided as one whole.\nTo wash away and transcend the subtle and profound.\nTo have no mind in affairs, no affairs in the mind.\nCan one be without flaw?\n\nBody and mind as one.\nTo love the people and govern the realm.\nTo delight the spirit and nourish the *qi*.\nCan one be without knowledge?\n\nTo have no thought, no action,\nno consideration, no worry.\nThe *Tiānmén* (天門, \"Heavenly Gate\") opens and closes,\nThe heart’s foundation becomes bright and clear.\nCan one be without flaw?\n\nOne without division,\nIlluminating all with clarity.\nLike ice melting beneath the moon’s brilliance.\nCan one be without knowledge?\n\nAll day as a fool—\nLife nurtures and accumulates within me.\nOne mind’s dwelling, containing all phenomena,\nLife gives yet does not possess.\nThe heart aligns with the *Tàixū* (太虚, \"Great Emptiness\").\nAct yet do not claim credit.\nWisdom encompasses all things.\nLengthen yet do not cut short.\nCalm and unselfed, this is called *Xuándé* (玄德, \"Mysterious Virtue\").\n\nLǎo Cùirán said:\nTo bear and nurture *pò* (魄, \"Ethereal Soul\").\nNow knowing its *zǐ* (子, \"child\"), again guarding its *mǔ* (母, \"mother\").\nTo embrace *yī* (一, \"Oneness\") and quiet the mind.\nCan one remain undivided?\n\nThe Dao/Way cannot be separated for even a moment.\nTo focus the *qi* and attain softness.\nTo direct one’s intent without division—\nthus, the spirit is concentrated.\nCan one be like an infant?\n\nReturn to childlike simplicity,\nDesireless and actionless.\nTo wash away and transcend the subtle and profound.\nNeither seeing nor hearing,\nInner and outer emptiness and clarity.\nCan one be without flaw?\n\nThus, no sickness or affliction.\nTo love the people and govern the realm—\nA ruler governs the world with the Dao/Way,\nI too love the spirit and guard the spirit.\nCan one be without action?\n\nThus, no reckless deeds.\nThe *Tiānmén* (天門, \"Heavenly Gate\") opens and closes—\nThe crown of the head splits apart,\nThe Yang spirit enters and departs.\nCan one be without duality?\n\nThe *Yīnguǐ* (陰鬼, \"Yin Ghost\") dissipates,\nNo demonic hindrance remains.\nIlluminating all with clarity—\nThe divine light radiates resplendent,\nFlowing in all eight directions.\nCan one be without knowledge?\n\nNaturally and effortlessly,\nBeyond what can be known.\nLife nurtures and accumulates within me—\nThe Dao/Way of itself generates me,\n*Virtue/Power* (德) also completes me.\nLife gives yet does not possess—\nReturning to the root, forgetting form and self.\nAct yet do not claim credit—\nEnlightenment bestows upon me,\nYet expects no recompense in return.\nLengthen yet do not cut short—\nIt lengthens and completes me,\nThus no harm comes to me.\nThis is called *Xuándé* (玄德, \"Mysterious Virtue\").\nSo it is said: \"With virtue, one's Dao/Way is naturally fulfilled.\"\n\nChén Bìxū said:\nTo bear and nurture *pò* (魄) while embracing *yī* (一, \"Oneness\"),\nCan one remain undivided?\n\nThe Daoists say the Yang spirit is called *hún* (魂, \"Corporeal Soul\"),\nAnd the *hún* delights in life.\nThe *Yīnguǐ* (陰鬼, \"Yin Ghost\") is called *pò* (魄),\nAnd the *pò* prefers death.\nThe *hún* wanders, the *pò* remains still.\n*The Bái Hǔ Tóng* (白虎通, \"White Tiger Discourses\") says:\n*The hún* is like clouds—\n*Yíng* (營, \"Ethereal Soul\") is the restless, unsettled form.\nThus, the *hún* is called *yíng*.\nThe old sayings state:\n\"To bear\" means \"to ride,\" and *yíng* is the *hún*.\nIt is also said that *yíng* protects the Yang *qi*.\nNow, the *hún* is the Yang Essence,\nThe *pò* is the Yin Spirit.\nThe Yang Essence thrives on movement and dissipation,\nThus Daoist texts have methods to restrain and retain it.\nThe Yin Spirit is prone to confusion and disturbance,\nThus Daoist texts have laws to subdue and control it.\nIf one’s form constantly rides the Yang Essence and Yin Spirit,\nEmbracing and guarding the pure, harmonious *Tàihé* (太和, \"Great Harmony\") *qi*,\nSo that it does not scatter or separate,\nThen one will forever preserve longevity.\n\nThe Daoist practice of embracing *yī* (一, \"Oneness\")\nIs like a mirror containing clarity—\nClarity does not separate from the mirror.\nThis teaching is about nurturing the spirit.\nNow I explain:\n\"Can one remain undivided?\" is the Master Lao’s questioning tone,\nLike asking, \"Can one uphold the precepts?\"\nNow, if one wishes to practice the art of embracing *yī*,\nOne must be able to keep the mind undivided.\nIf one can keep the mind undivided,\nThen one is riding the *hún* and *pò*,\nEmbracing the pure, harmonious Dao/Way.\n\nCan one be like an infant?\nAll the following points are explained with this meaning.\n\nTo focus the *qi* and attain softness—\nCan one be like an infant?\nThe old sayings state:\n\"To focus\" means \"to be one\" and \"to entrust.\"\n*Qi* is the *Chōnghé miàoqì* (沖和妙氣, \"Unifying and Harmonious Marvelous *Qi*\"),\nAlso the natural *qi*.\nA person stands alone, transformed by nature,\nReceiving the natural, unifying, harmonious marvelous *qi*.\nAs the *qi* descends and the form is born,\nIt remains untainted and pure.\nIf one entrusts to the unifying marvelous *qi*,\nForgets all knowledge and perception,\nAllows the *qi* to naturally purify and harmonize,\nAnd the form to naturally soften and weaken—\nUnharmed by all evil,\nThis is attaining the complete harmony of an infant.\nThis teaching is about nurturing the *qi*.\n\nNow I explain:\n\"Can one be like an infant?\" means,\nWhen one desires to focus the *qi* and attain softness,\nCan one be like an infant in pure harmony?\nIf one can be like an infant in pure harmony,\nThen one has attained the art of focusing the *qi* and attaining softness.\n\nTo wash away and transcend the subtle and profound—\nCan one be without flaw?\nThe old sayings state:\n\"To wash away\" means \"to cleanse.\"\n\"To transcend\" means \"to dispel\" and \"to regulate.\"\n*Xuánlǎn* (玄覽, \"Subtle Perception\") is the illumination of the mind.\n*Cī* (疵, \"flaw\") refers to imperfections and diseases.\nA person should cleanse dust and filth,\nDispel the Five *Emotions* (五情),\nInner and outer emptiness and clarity,\nThe mind illuminated over all things—\nImperfections and diseases do not arise.\nThis teaching is about cultivating the heart.\n\nFrom these three matters above,\nIt concerns oneself in cultivating the body.\nFrom these three matters below,\nIt encourages governing the realm.\nThe Classic says:\n\"Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue is true.\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.\"\n\nNow I explain:\n\"Can one be without flaw?\" means,\nWhen one desires to cleanse the heart and dispel impurities,\nTo introspect all inner and outer matters,\nOne must be able to self-examine,\nTo have no flaws or imperfections.\nIf one can have no flaws or imperfections,\nThen one has attained the method of washing away and transcending the subtle and profound.\n\nTo love the people and govern the realm—\nCan one be without action?\nThe old sayings state:\n\"To love the people\" means to love them as one’s own children,\nIn governing, one must not be harsh or cruel,\nTaxes and labor must not harm their nature.\n\"To govern the realm\" means to focus on agriculture and simplify matters,\nAllowing the people to pursue their vocations and live in peace—\nThis is the transformation of *Wuwéi* (無為, \"Non-action\").\n\nNow I explain:\n\"Can one be without action?\" means,\nWhen a ruler desires to love and nurture all people,\nTo not harm their natural inclinations,\nTo govern by focusing on agriculture,\nTo avoid unnecessary complexity,\nOne must be able to remain calm, clear, and without action.\nIf one can remain calm, clear, and without action,\nThen one has attained the art of loving the people and governing the realm.\n\nThe *Tiānmén* (天門, \"Heavenly Gate\") opens and closes—\nCan one be without duality?\n*The Tiānmén* is the gate of nature.\nNature generates the *Tàijí* (太極, \"Supreme Pole\"),\nThe *Tàijí* generates Heaven and Earth,\nHeaven and Earth generate Yin and Yang,\nYin and Yang generate all things and destroy all things—\nLife and death proceed through this gate,\nThus it is called the *Tiānmén* (天門, \"Heavenly Gate\").」\n\n「Opening refers to *sànshī* (散施, \"dissemination and giving\"), closing to *xīlǐn* (歙敛, \"withdrawal and restraint\"). When the gate opens, all things flourish; when it closes, they wither and perish. Though it generates myriad beings, one does not see its *shēngshēng* (生生, \"life-giving life\"); though it destroys all things, one does not see its *sǐsǐ* (死死, \"death-dealing death\"). Life and death proceed through this gate unseen—is this not called *natural* (自然)?\n\nThose who embody *natural* (自然) are none other than the *Dàrén* (大人, \"Great Person\"). The *Dàrén* measures the cosmos with their breadth, their *qi* (氣) encompasses Yin and Yang. When they act with *qīngjìng* (清静, \"serene stillness\") and *wéijìng* (雌静, \"receptive quietude\"), the cycles of life and death, flourishing and decline, do not enter their mind.\n\n*Wéijìng* (雌静) is the subtle *mystic application* (妙用) of *natural* (自然). For those who cultivate the self and govern the realm, they must always uphold *wéijìng* (雌静) as their principle.\n\nThe old saying explains:\n*The Tiānmén* (天門) is the gate of the *Zǐgōng* (紫宫, \"Purple Palace\") at the *Beǐjī* (北极, \"North Pole\"). In the heavens, the *Beǐjī* (北极星, \"North Pole Star\") resides within the *Zǐgōng* (紫宫). Within this palace, the *Wǔdì* (五帝, \"Five Emperors\") succeed one another in their reigns of rest and rule (*xiūwáng* 休王), thus the gate has opening and closing.\n\nWhen it opens, it aligns with *Tài* (泰, \"Harmony\"); when it closes, it aligns with *Pǐ* (否, \"Disharmony\"). Hence, in spring, the *Qīngdì* (青帝, \"Green Emperor\")’s gate opens while the others close. Such is the example of the four seasons, and likewise, the *Wǔyùn* (五运, \"Five Phases/Processes\") of completion and renewal, the shifts in *lìshù* (历数, \"cosmic cycles\") and their rise and fall—these are not constant. Only the *sage* (圣人) knows *Tian* (天, \"Heaven\") and *Mìng* (命, \"Fate\"), perpetually guarding *wéijìng* (雌静) and *qiānxìa* (谦下, \"humble receptivity\"), thus they are not swayed by change. Therefore, they attain *Yǒnghéng Yuánjí* (永亨元吉, \"eternal prosperity and primal auspiciousness\").\n\nSome discuss this in terms of self-cultivation: *Tiānmén* (天門) refers to the nose and mouth. Opening and closing mean *chuǎnxī* (喘息, \"breathing\") and *hūxī* (呼吸, \"respiration\"). When one embodies *wéijìng* (雌静) and *róuhé* (柔和, \"gentle harmony\"), their breath becomes deep and expansive, continuous and subtle, nurturing their *spirit* (精神) into *tiánrán* (恬然, \"tranquil repose\"), free and effortless.\n\nNow I explain:\nThose who can practice *wéijìng* (雌静) speak of the *Tiānmén* (天門) opening and closing in rest and rule (*xiūwáng* 休王)—this is the constant of *lìshù* (历数). Only those who guard *wéijìng* (雌静) and *qiānxìa* (谦下) can thus prevent Yin and Yang from altering them, nor can cold and heat change them.\n\n*Míng* (明, \"illumination\") and *Sìdá* (四达, \"fourfold penetration\")—can one truly be without knowing (*wúzhī* 能无知)?\n\nThe old saying explains:\n*Míng* (明) means *huìzhào* (慧照, \"wise illumination\"). For self-cultivation, even with a mind of *huìzhào* (慧照), one’s *cleverness* (聪明) and *Sìdá* (通达) should be as though without perception or hearing. In governance, one’s *virtue* (德) should be *míngbái* (明白, \"clear and luminous\"), like the sun and moon’s radiance, penetrating the four seas. Yet, one must block their *cleverness* (塞聪) and obscure their *illumination* (蔽明), achieving *wúzhī* (无知, \"non-knowing\") so that the people of the world live their daily lives unaware—this is called *having the Dao* (有道).\n\nNow I explain:\nThose who seek *zhìhuì míngbái* (智慧明白, \"wise illumination\") and *Sìdá* (四达) must first practice *shōushì fǎn tīng* (收视反听, \"withdrawing sight and inverting hearing\"). Only then can they perpetually uphold *wúzhī* (无知). If one attains *wúzhī* (无知), then it is the *source* (原) of *wise illumination* (智慧明白) and *fourfold penetration* (四达).\n\nTo *nurture* (畜) life is the ultimate *Xuándé* (玄德, \"mystic virtue\"). It means that in cultivating the self and governing the realm, one can enact the six affairs above—like the Dao’s *shēngwù* (生物, \"life-giving\"), not obstructing its source, allowing it to flourish naturally; or *virtue’s* (德) *yǎngwù* (养物, \"nurturing beings\"), not restraining their nature, preserving their innate essence.\n\nThe myriad things arise singularly—does the *sage* (圣人) not rely on them? All classes pursue their own endeavors—does the *sage* (圣人) depend on them? Moreover, things grow and nourish themselves—where does the *sage* (圣人) preside over them? This is the *forgetting merit and forgetting things* (忘功忘物), penetrating the *míngjí* (冥极, \"profound depths\"), called *yuāndé* (渊德, \"abyssal virtue\").\n\n*Wang Bi* (王弼) says:\n*Yuāndé* (渊德) is *having virtue without knowing its master* (有德而不知其主), emerging from the *yōumíng* (幽冥, \"mysterious darkness\").\n\n*Xiè Túnán* (谢图南) says:\n*To bear the spirit and the vital force* (载营魄) until there is no separation (*wúlí* 无离).\n\nThe *Shū* (书, *Book of Documents*) says:\n*\"O! the spirit is born\"* (哉生魄), pointing to the sixteenth day of the month. After the *jìwàng* (既望, \"full moon\"), the *spirit* (魄) is born as the *light* (明) dies, marking the initial growth of *Yin* (阴).\n\nIn a person’s body, the *soul* (魂) is *Yang* (阳), while the *vital force/spirit* (魄) is *Yin* (阴). When *Yin* (阴) is growing, the *vital force/spirit* (魄) is restless and strives forward, yet if one guards *unity* (一) without separation, they will not be overcome by *Yin* (阴).\n\n*Unity* (一) is the *Xuán* (玄, \"mystic\") of Heaven, the *Yang* (阳). Applied to the realm, it means that the *small people* (小人) cannot overcome the *gentlemen* (君子), for they share the same Dao.\n\n*Concentrating qi to achieve softness* (专气致柔)—can one be like an *infant* (婴儿)?\n\n*Huáng Shígōng* (黄石公) says:\n*Softness can overcome hardness* (柔能胜刚), *weakness can overcome strength* (弱能胜强). The *method of nourishing the body* (沁养身之道) takes *softness* (柔) as its foundation. If one’s *qi* (氣) is not concentrated, then the *strong and violent Yang* (强暴之阳) will exploit it. One must be like an *infant* (婴儿) before they are *cháibéi* (孩, \"childlike\"), the ultimate of *softness* (柔). Human desires, if many, will surely be controlled by the *strong Yang* (强阳)—this must be guarded against.\n\n*Washing away and penetrating the mysterious* (涤除玄览)—can one be without *flaws* (疵)?\n\nThe *classic* (经) says:\n*\"Though the sage may have splendid dwellings, their repose is lofty and detached\"* (圣人虽有荣观，燕处超然). This is the meaning of *Xuánlǎn* (玄览, \"mystic penetration\").\n\n*垂旒蔽目* (Chuíliú bìmù, \"hanging tassels to blind the eyes\") means not desiring one’s eyes to engage with external things. Engaging externally with things, one’s internal mind follows suit. The way of cultivating the self is to *not see what is desirable* (不见可欲), so the mind does not stray. Washing away the external, one’s vision aligns with *Xuánwéi* (玄微, \"mystic subtleties\"). To be without *flaws* (疵) means that human desires cannot intrude upon Heavenly principle (*Tiānlǐ* 天理).\n\n*Loving the people and governing the realm* (爱民治国)—can one be without action (*wúwéi* 能无为)?\n\nCultivating the self is the foundation for governing the realm. The root of the world lies in a *clear mind* (内心清明), not being seized by *sìyù* (嗜欲, \"greedy desires\"). Then, one can love each and every person, govern the realm, and achieve *wúwéi* (无为, \"non-action\"), making *no action* (事无事) into *action* (事).\n\n*Yáo’s* (尧) *fēixīn* (非心, \"non-attachment\") and *Shùn’s* (舜) *gōngjǐ* (恭己, \"self-respectful humility\") are all of this Dao.\n\n*The Tiānmén* (天門) opens and closes—can one be without *Yin* (雌)?\n\nThe *classic* (经) says:\n*\"Block the *Yuè* (兑, \"Joy/Compliance\") and close the gate, and one will move not all their life.\"* (塞其兑，闭其门，终身不动)\n\n*The Tiānmén* (天門) refers to the *Shàngqián Gōng* (上乾宫, \"Upper Qian Palace\"). *雌* (Wéi, \"receptive\") is *Yin* (阴). The opening and closing of *Tiānmén* (天門) is to have a *constant measure* (常度), preventing *Yin* (阴邪, \"perverse Yin\") from exploiting it—then one’s body is in harmony.\n\nApplied to the realm, this means *excluding the four gates* (辟四门) and *not employing the small people* (小人勿用).\n\n*Míngbái Sìdá* (明白四达)—can one be without knowing (*wúzhī* 能无知)?\n\n*Viewing* (视) is not with the eyes but with the *Dao* (道), then *illumination* (明) can be *fourfold* (四达). *Open and unobstructed* (疏通无蔽), yet one can name what comes—*private desires* (私欲) cannot interfere. Even what is near, at the edge of one’s sight, is not seen—how much more so with what is distant?\n\nThose who attain *wúzhī* (无知) are not *seeking to know* (不求知). *Not stepping outside the door yet knowing the world* (不出户而知天下), *not peering through the window yet seeing Heavenly Dao* (不窥牖而见天道)—how can this be achieved by *knowing through knowing* (有知知之)?\n\n*The Guān Yǐn Zǐ* (关尹子) says:\n*\"One emotion, one vital force—this is the sage\"* (一情冥为圣人).\n\n*Nurturing life* (生之畜之) reaches the ultimate of *Xuándé* (玄德, \"mystic virtue\").」\n\nWhen falsehoods are extinguished, Heavenly Principle flourishes naturally.\nApplied to oneself, it means accumulating virtue within, growing daily without self-awareness.\nApplied to the world, it means every person and thing is encompassed within nurturing and growth, yet never claiming credit for it.\nThis is what constitutes *Xuándé* (玄德, \"mystic virtue\").\n*Xuán* (玄) is Heaven; *zǎi* (宰) is Master—\nIndeed, when examined:\nthe Yang cannot exist without Yin, nor Yin without Yang—this is inevitable.\nYet the Sage ever seeks to advance Yang and suppress Yin—is this not Yang as the Noble, Yin as the petty?\nYin within oneself becomes a burden to the body;\npetty men in the state become a harm to the nation.\nThe Way of cultivating the self and governing the state is one and the same.\n\nThus, with no thought and no action,\nyet never losing the heart of the innocent child—\nunaware and unknowing,\nwhile utterly repelling all external malevolent *qi*,\none’s body may then attain ease and freedom.\nExtended to the world and the state—what further effort is needed?\n\nVast as Heaven’s movement, profound as divine transformation—\nthere exists an unknowable yet natural operation—\nis this not *Xuándé*?\n\nShùn’s Heavenly Virtue lies in his harmonizing with Heaven’s Principle and the affairs of things—\nis this not the case?\n\nLín Yōngzhāi says:\n*\"To bear the *yíngpò* (营魄) is called *Xuándé*.\"*\n*Yíng* (营) is *hún* (魂, spirit), *shén* (神, mind);\n*Pò* (魄) is *jīng* (精, essence), *qì* (气, vital force).\nThese three characters hold the profound intent of *Lǎozǐ*.\n*\"To bear\"* is like a cart bearing goods—\nplacing *\"bear\"* above and *\"yíngpò\"* below, like a riddle.\nIf *pò* bears *yíng*, it is the common man;\nif *yíng* bears *pò*, it is the Sage.\nTogether, they form a unity;\nseparated, they are two.\n*\"Bao\"* (抱) means unity—\nits meaning is: *Can one embrace unity and remain undivided?*\nWould one allow division into two?\nThus it asks: *Can one embrace unity without separation?*\nThese six words hold deep meaning—\nthey urge self-reflection and enlightenment.\n\nAn infant, untouched by perception, possesses concentrated *qi*.\n*Zhèng* (政) means extreme; *róu* (柔) means yielding.\nIf one can, like the infant, concentrate *qi* and attain supreme yielding,\nthen one can embrace unity.\nThus it asks: *Can one be like the infant?*\nThese are *Lǎozǐ*’s questioning words—\nmeaning: *Can people truly achieve this?*\nThe following sentences are the same.\n\nTo purify flaws and contemplate the profound darkness,\none must have a discriminating mind.\nThe flawless is without discrimination—\neven when purifying flaws, if one holds no notion of impurity or purity,\nthen one can embrace unity.\n\nIf one has the merit of loving the people and governing the state,\nyet holds a heart of *wuwei* (无为) while acting,\nthen one can embrace unity.\n\nIn the interplay of Yin and Yang, the principles of male and female,\nthough there is the natural interplay of attraction and response,\none must lack the discriminating mind of attraction and response—\nthen one can embrace unity.\n\nThe *Tiānmén* (天门, Heavenly Gate) refers to the natural principles between Heaven and Earth—\nthis is a metaphor borrowed from creation.\nBecause of such language, it has entered the realm of cultivation,\nand some have mistakenly used it for heretical teachings,\nthus misleading many.\n\n*Míngbái Sìdá* (明白四达)—\nto be open and unobstructed in all things,\nyet to regard *wúzhī* (无知) as knowing—\nthis is to embrace unity.\n\n*Shēng zhī xù zhī* (生之畜之)—\nspeaking of the interplay of creation,\nwhich nurtures all things.\nHow does creation ever regard them as existing?\nHow does it ever rely on them as capable?\nThough it is the sovereign of all things,\nhow does it ever hold the heart of controlling them?\nOnly thus can it be called the profound and mysterious virtue.\n\nThe intent of this chapter is, broadly,\nto emphasize *wuwei* (无为) while acting,\nto be natural and effortless—\nfor the heart to remain ever empty.\nThus, the mind bears the *pò* (魄),\nnot the *pò* bearing the mind—\nthis is the Sage’s affair.\nIf the *pò* bears the mind, it becomes attached to form.\nThe *Lǎozǐ*’s text, broadly,\nis about being able to be real yet empty,\nable to have yet be without—\nthis is the ultimate Dao.\nFrom all angles, it speaks of this principle alone.\n\nFàn Yìngyuán says:\n*\"To bear the *yíngpò* and embrace unity—can one remain undivided?\"*\n*Yíngpò* is *húnpò* (魂魄, spirit and vital force).\nThe *Nèiguān Jīng* (内观经) says:\n*\"Movement to nourish the body is called *hún* (魂);\nstillness to settle the form is called *pò* (魄).\"*\nHé Shànggōng says:\n*\"Yíngpò* is *húnpò*—\nthe *hún* belongs to Yang, the *pò* to Yin.\n*Yī* (一) is the Dao’s unity—\nmeaning the body bears the *húnpò*,\nembracing the Dao’s unity,\nnever separating for an instant.\nCan people achieve this?\"\n\nTo concentrate *qi* and attain extreme yielding—\ncan one be without flaws?\n*Zhuān* (专) means steadfast and unyielding.\n*Cī* (疵) is blemish or disease.\nThe infant’s *qi* is concentrated and harmoniously yielding—\nmeaning it does not resist *qi*,\nthus attaining harmony and yielding.\nTo always remain as in infancy—\ncan people achieve this?\n\nIf the heart is not empty, it cannot be clear;\nif unclear, it cannot be penetrating—\nmeaning to eliminate private desires,\nto refine the original heart to pristine clarity,\nlike jade without flaws,\nlike a mirror without dust—\nthen in contemplating affairs,\nall are within the natural Principle.\nCan people achieve this?\n\nTo love the people and govern the state—\ncan one act without acting?\nMeaning that embracing unity, concentrating *qi*, purifying desires,\nafter cultivating the self and clarifying the heart,\none can extend this Dao to all people—\nthis is the foundation of loving the people and governing the state.\nFollowing natural principles to respond to affairs,\nthere is always the proper path to take.\nThus, for those who love the people,\nit is not mere partial affection,\nbut to not harm them—this is the ultimate love;\nfor those who govern the state,\nit is not mere partial governance,\nbut to not let it fall into chaos—this is the ultimate governance.\nCan people achieve this?\n\nThe opening and closing of the *Tiānmén* (Heavenly Gate)—\ncan one avoid the male?\nThe *Tiānmén* refers to the entry and exit of one’s mind and spirit—\nthough the mind and spirit cannot truly be said to enter or exit,\nyet responding to things is exit,\nresponding to oneself is entry.\nExit is opening,\nentry is closing.\n\nOne must speak thus—it cannot be otherwise.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* [\"Heaven’s Operation\" chapter] states:\n*\"Zheng* is uprightness—if one’s heart rejects this,\nthe *Tiānmén* will not open.\nChéng Xuányīng’s annotation also says:\nThe *Tiānmén* is the heart.\n*Rú* (雌) means to abide in stillness and gentle harmony—\nit is the principle of responding only after being moved.\n\nHéshànggōng and Sū Zhì both interpret *rú* as *rú* (雌).\nSome manuscripts read *wú rú* (无雌), likely not the original intent.\nFor the text indeed speaks of ‘knowing the *xióng* (雄) while guarding the *rú* (雌).’\nBy *rú*, it means: the heart is the Heavenly Heart—\nat every moment of motion and stillness,\none must remain *rú* (gently yielding),\nso that the spirit and *qi* flow harmoniously,\nand thus the opening and closing of yin and yang *qi*\nare also in harmony.\n\nCan one be without knowing?\n*Míngbái* (明白) is emptiness;\n*Sìdá* (四达) is openness.\nThis heart, empty and luminous, vast and unobstructed,\nresponds only after being moved—\nyet remains ever empty and without self,\nacting without acting—\ncan people achieve this?\n\nFor this heart does nothing yet accomplishes all—\nnon-action is its root,\nomni-action its manifestation.\nYet root and branch are one:\ngrasp the root, and one act moves all things,\nand everywhere is correct;\nmaster the branch, and all things return to unity,\nand never stray.\nBut one must guard the root—\nthen the branch will naturally return to unity.\n\n*\"Shēng zhī xù zhī zhì shì wéi xuándé\"*—\n*\"Nurturing life and fostering growth until this point is called the Mysterious Virtue.\"*\n*\"Xù\"* means to nourish the root.\nAll things arise from the Dao and are born,\nand are sustained by virtue—\nyet they are born without being claimed,\nnurtured without reliance on merit,\nand when fully grown, are not dominated.\nThus all things find their place,\nand yet they do not know why—\nthis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao without trace,\ntransforming all things broadly—\nthus the people do not know the Emperor’s power;\nthis is the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nXuē Yǒngzhāi says:\n*\"Nurturing the spirit and embracing the One—\ncan one avoid separation?\"*\nWén Xuán’s Master says:\n*\"Cultivating the spirit and embracing the True One—\ncan one avoid their separation?\"*\n\nThe utmost yin is solemn and still,\nthe utmost yang is radiant and vast—\nsolemn stillness issues from Heaven,\nradiant vastness arises from Earth.\nTheir interaction—\nthen the essence of the sun and moon is carried,\nand the breath of Heaven and Earth is drawn—\nmother and child guard each other,\nlike fish in water—\nthis is the Dao of eternal life and longevity.\n\nWáng Bǎo says:\n*\"Gathering essence and converging spirit—\nis there not some knowing involved?\"*\n*\"Specializing in *qi* and attaining gentleness—\ncan one be like an infant?\"*\nTo focus on nurturing *qi* until bones weaken and sinews soften—\ncan one be like an infant?\n*\"Purifying and gazing into the Mysterious—\ncan one be without blemish?\"*\nTo gaze into the transformations of all things yet remain without flaw—\nthis is only because the gaze into the Mysterious still lingers.\nIf one purifies and discards the Mysterious gaze,\nthen there will be no blemish.\n\nLoving the people and governing the state—\ncan one act without acting?\nThe heart is the sovereign,\nthe body is the state,\nessence and *qi* are the people.\nIf the sovereign governs without acting,\nthe state grows rich and the people are at ease.\nIf one acts instead,\nnot only is it unbeneficial—\nit brings harm.\n\nThe opening and closing of the *Tiānmén*—\ncan one remain *rú* (gently yielding)?\nHeaven is the heart,\nthe Gate is where all laws emerge.\nOpening and closing are release and withdrawal.\n*Rú* is gentleness—\nthe Mysterious Mechanism’s subtle operation\nsometimes withdraws in gentle harmony,\nwithout harshness or injury,\nwalking in accordance with response,\nsubtle and penetrating, boundless and unobstructed,\nyet without self-praise or arrogance—\nsteadfastly, as if without knowing—\nthe Three Powers act through the Dao and give birth,\nall things are nurtured by virtue.\nThough they are born and nurtured,\none does not claim the merit;\nthough they are the masters of transformation,\none does not rely on one’s exalted status—\n\nAll things receive the grace of Heaven,\nand thus grow and flourish—\nyet none claim dominion.\nTo let them grow and transform naturally\nis called attaining the Great Dao.\n\nMaster Chu Bo-xiu remarked:\n*\"The phrase '载营魄' signifies the Mysterious Virtue.\"*\n\nThe opening character *zài* (載) in the chapter’s title\nhas long baffled interpreters.\nIt seems the first three characters form a clause,\nwith *\"bào yī\"* (抱一) belonging to the following text,\nakin to the structure of later passages—\nthus requiring careful parsing to align meaning.\n\nUpon deep reflection,\nI found in Master Guo Zhong-shu’s *Pèi Jiě Jí* (佩解集),\nquoting the Kaiyuan Edict:\n*\"With reverence for the Sacred Teachings,\nI pondered the Profound Essence,\nand recently altered the tenth chapter’s\noriginal *zài* (載) to *zāi* (哉),\nrestoring it to the preceding sentence.\nWhen the matter was deliberated,\nall agreed it was correct.\nThus, the true meaning was clarified,\nand the commentary was refined.\nThis resolves a thousand years of confusion.\"*\n\nFor the ancient text was unchaptered;\nlater scholars mistakenly severed the phrase\n*—the Dao, the virtue—*\nat the end of the sentence,\nthen appended the next chapter’s opening,\nand in transcription, *zài* (載) was corrupted to *zāi* (哉).\nThe structure of Chapter 53’s closing\n*—not the Dao—*\nproves this error.\n\nNow, examining the Kaiyuan Emperor’s *Daodejing*,\nit also renders *zài* (載) at the start,\nwith the initial interpretation.\nDu Guangting further expounds it as *\"to bear and convey.\"*\nIn *Bùcéng Lí Zhāng* (不曾离章),\nit reads *zāi* (哉).\nYet I do not know the source of Guo Zhong-shu’s citation.\nGiven Master Chu’s reference,\nI provisionally retain this view.\n\nThe *Dingguan Jing* states:\n\n*\"Movement nourishing the body is called the soul (魂),\nstillness governing the form is called the spirit (魄).\nThe soul, bright and yang, ascends;\nthe spirit, dark and yin, descends.\nYang moves, yin stirs—\ntogether they forge transformation.\nThe two qi lodge in form and circulate,\nyet if they cannot return to their root,\nday by day they dwindle, month by month they perish—\nleaves fall, the tree withers.\n\nThe Sage teaches the soul and spirit to both embrace *One*.\n*One*—that from which the Dao is born,\nthe origin of numbers, the source of all things.\nIn humankind, it is the primal nature.\nWhen soul and spirit cling to *One*,\nthey do not depart—\nthen movement and stillness are both forgotten,\nand the Dao remains unattained.\nIf one steadfastly guards the qi without interruption,\nthen one attains the utmost softness,\nunmoved by joy or anger.\n\nIf guarding the qi is not steadfast,\nthen forceful yang can intrude,\nand at the slightest provocation, it erupts violently—\nthe scattered, dissipated qi cannot sustain life,\nnor can the form endure without spirit.\nHow could this not be taken with utmost care?\n\nLike an infant—\nthough it lacks knowledge,\nits joy and anger are pure,\na single harmonious breath.\nThis is the secret work of the Mysterious Gate,\nthe method of refining qi and regulating breath\npassed down through the ages.\nYet most stray into false paths,\nfew attain the true way.\n\nThe Dao lies in simplicity,\nin tranquil stillness, never straying from daily life.\nWith an empty heart and non-action,\nthe Dao naturally abides.\nBut scholars often seek esoteric wonders,\npursuing what lies beyond the void—\nthe more they seek, the more distant they grow.\nWhen all is stripped away and returned to its origin,\nthe Dao’s essence remains whole—\nwhat need for duality?\n\nA kingdom is a metaphor for the body,\nits people for the vital qi.\nHow could one not know this?\"*\n\nThe ancient text reads thus, and later passages confirm that knowing this proves the ruin of the realm.\n\nThe Heavenly Gate—through it all things and transformations enter and exit. The sun opens, the moon closes, and through this the divine functions are manifested. The Sage expounds this Dao in secret, taking *yin* stillness as the foundation. Thus, when the principles are illuminated, responding to things requires no effort, and one attains perfect clarity and boundless understanding.\n\nHow could one fail to recognize this?\n\nThe ancient text reads thus, but the vulgar *He Shang* version alters \"love the people\" to \"non-action,\" and \"clear and bright\" to \"without knowledge\"—directly contradictory. \"Without doing\" is akin to \"without purpose.\" Fearful that cleverness would obstruct the Dao, the teaching thus advocates non-action.\n\nAll above pertains to cultivating the self.\n\nNow one must take nurturing life as the heart.\n\nTo give birth without claiming its merit,\nto act without relying on its strength—\nsettled yet expansive,\nnot lording over others with tyrannical pride—\nthis is called the profound and wondrous virtue beyond mortal comprehension.\n\nThe *Niu Miao* Transmission says:\n*\"Carrying the spirit-soul, embracing the One—\nhow could one stray from it?\"*\n\n*Carrying* means \"repeatedly.\"\n*Camp* means \"life.\"\n*Po* means \"moon.\"\n*Embracing the One* refers to the moon’s first emergence.\n\nWhen the *po* dissipates, it is called the moon’s end.\nWhen *po* carries *ying*, it is called the moon’s unity.\n\nIndeed, at the moon’s birth, there is but a single point of luminosity.\nIf one clings to it, it gradually grows until full and radiant.\nThus observed, even the moon cannot depart from that single point of light, always embracing it—\nhow much more so for all else?\n\nThis is the art of nurturing the subtle to achieve the manifest,\nfrom one to myriad things.\n\nThe One is the Dao.\nAll things under heaven—what does not arise from this Dao?\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"The Dao is never to be abandoned, even for a moment.\"*\n\nWhen a person has the Dao, they live.\nWhen they lack it, they die.\n\"Live\" and \"die\" depend solely on whether one can embrace the One or not.\n\nCan one concentrate the qi and attain supreme softness,\nas an infant does?\n\n*Specialization* is *oneness*.\n*Qi* is the body’s fullness.\nTruly, between heaven and earth, what sustains life and breath\nis nothing but qi.\n\nThe so-called \"infant brother\" retains pristine nature,\nuntainted by human desires.\nAs one grows, however, external stimuli stir the mind,\nand desires gradually arise,\ncorrupting the innate pure heart.\nThus, internally, preferences and aversions become unchecked,\nwhile externally, sounds and colors ensnare the senses—\nfrom this, decline naturally follows.\n\nIf a person unifies their will\nand does not violently disrupt their qi,\ntheir body becomes harmonious and supple,\nlight and vigorous—\nlike an infant or maiden.\n\n*Liezi* said:\n*\"An infant’s qi is concentrated, its will unified—\nthe pinnacle of harmony.\nNothing harms it,\nand no virtue surpasses it.\"*\n\nThis is what is meant.\n\n「Purge and illuminate the Dao/Way—\ncould there be any flaw?\n\n*Purge* is cleansing.\n*Except* is removing.\n*Playen* is the Dao/Way.\n*Lan* is observation.\n*Flaw* is blemish, meaning error.\n\nSpeaking of the Dao/Way for humanity,\nit requires constant cleansing of body and mind,\nremoval of external distractions,\nand observing the subtleties of the Dao/Way,\nso that one may become a person who exhausts principles and fulfills nature*—*\nbetween heaven and earth,\nthey can avoid great errors.\nHow could they be called flawed?\n\nThe vulgar speak of the \"Heavenly Heart\" as a mirror—\nwithout cleansing, it cannot be clear;\nthe Dao/Way is like a shadow—\nwithout observation, it cannot be seen.\n\nThus, the Dao/Way scholar always cultivates and reflects,\nwithout any interruption,\nso that their *virtue/power* remains luminous\nand is not obscured by cravings.\n\nLike a person bathing once a day—\nor bathing daily,\nnever ceasing their bathing,\nif their cleansing and purifying rituals are uninterrupted,\nthen their body remains pristine and clear,\nnot stained by past impurities,\nand their mirror reflects without dust,\ntheir heart illuminates the Dao/Way.\n\nThis is the meaning of *purge and illuminate the Dao/Way*.\n\nLoving the people and governing the state—\ncould there be any *action/doing*?\n\nTruly, the people are the foundation of the state;\nif the foundation is secure, the state is at peace.\nThus, one who governs the state must first love the people,\nand the way to love the people is through *non-action*.\n*Non-action* means not to obstruct.\n\nAs in the past, when Tang Taizong once told his attendants:\n*\"The ruler depends on the state,\nthe state depends on the people.\nIf you exploit the people to serve the ruler,\nit is like cutting flesh to fill the belly.\nThe belly may be full while the body dies,\nthe ruler may grow rich while the state perishes.\nThus, the ruler’s misfortune does not come from without,\nbut arises from within.\"*\n\nAfterward, he lightened taxes and burdens,\nselected capable officials.\nFrom then on, the empire flourished in peace,\npeople had abundant clothing and food,\nouter doors remained open,\nand travelers lodged freely in the wilds.\nIs this not the saying of loving the people and governing the state\nthrough *non-action* and non-obstruction?\n\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate*—\ncould there be any imbalance?\n\nThe *Heavenly Gate* is the mouth.\nTruly, the mouth is the gateway of the body—\nthe head round as heaven,\nso the mouth is called the *Heavenly Gate*.\n\n*Opening and closing* refers to breathing,\n*imbalance* means the lack of harmony between yin and yang.\n\nTruly, opening and closing,\nbreathing,\nyin and yang—\nthese refer to *dynamic and static*.\n*Dynamic and static* are the interplay of movement and stillness.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"One dynamic, one static—\nmutually their roots.\nOne yin, one yang—\nthis is called the Dao/Way.\nThose who follow it are good.\"*\n\nWho could have inhalation without exhalation?\nWho could have stillness without movement?\nThus, it is said: *The Heavenly Gate opens and closes—*\ncould there be any imbalance?\n\n*The True Definition Scripture* states:\n*\"Two movements constitute yin,\none stillness constitutes yang.\nYang alone brings variation,\nyin alone maintains constancy.\nUnderstanding constancy and awakening to clarity,\nembracing unity and resonating with the spirit*—*\nthe interplay of *kan* and *li* is fixed,\ntransformation and change occur naturally.\"*\n\nThis discusses the balance of yin and yang,\nmovement and stillness.\nThus, it is said: *The Heavenly Gate opens and closes—*\ncould there be any imbalance?\n\nClear and penetrating, fourfold and boundless—\ncould there be any ignorance?\n\n*Clear* means keen perception.\n*White* means bright sensitivity.\n*Boundless* means thoroughness.\n\nA person with keen perception and bright sensitivity,\nwhose understanding is fourfold and boundless,\ncan know the world without stepping outside their door,\ncan see the Dao/Way without peering through windows.\nWho would call them ignorant?\n\n*Knowledge* means the ability to perceive the four directions,\nconsult the four cardinal officials,\nand understand the four kinds of people.\nOnly a ruler who is clear and boundless\ncan truly know them.\n\nAs with Yao’s opening of the four gates,\nilluminating the four eyes,\nand attuning the four ears—\nthis is the case.\n\nA ruler of the world,\nusing the four directions’ ears as their own,\nnot hoarding their ears,\ncan thus communicate the world’s intentions\nand grasp the world’s emotions.\n\nUsing the four directions’ eyes as their own,\nnot hoarding their eyes,\nthen the world’s clarity becomes their own clarity.\nThus, their vision is never unreflective,\ntheir hearing is never unperceptive.\nWho would call them ignorant?\nThis is the meaning of *clear and boundless*.\n\nTo nurture and sustain life—\nto generate without possessing generation,\nto sustain without claiming credit for nurturing.\n*Not possessing* means not taking ownership of the deed.\n\nTake heaven and earth, for instance—\nthey generate all things,\nyet all things never claim it as heaven’s and earth’s work.\nTake the sage, for instance—\nthe sage nurtures the world with benevolence,\nyet the world never credits it as the sage’s favor.\nIt is not that heaven and earth have no work,\nnor that the sage offers no benefits—\ntheir deeds are profound yet unmanifest,\ntheir benefits vast yet unapparent.\nThus, they receive the work without knowing its source,\nthey accept the benefits without feeling gratitude.\n\nHere, we see the grandeur of heaven, earth, and the sage.\nIf heaven, earth, and the sage had boasted of their work,\nthen it would not be called *generating without possessing*.\n\nThe *Scripture* says: *\"Heaven and earth lack virtue/power,\"*\nand again: *\"The sage lacks virtue/power.\"*\nThis is the saying of *generating without possessing*.\n\nTo act without relying—\nthis is what is called *Playen Virtue/Power*.\n\nThe sage is the most noble among people,\nyet they never rely on their nobility.\nTruly, the sage governs the world and directs customs,\ntransforming alone in the *Dao/Way’s* shaping*—*\nthey do not cling to lowly words,\nnor do they seize the common level of the multitude,\nthus they act without relying,\nthey grow without harvesting.\nYet the sage never claims their own nobility,\nnor do they ever fail to follow the sage’s virtue/power.\n\nThe greater they are, the smaller they seem;\nthe higher they rise, the lower they appear;\nthe clearer they become, the more obscure they are—\nthis is how they become sage.\nThus, it is called *Playen Virtue/Power*.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Modest, modest, the noble person—\nhumble to cultivate themselves.\"*\nIs this not the same meaning?\n\nYang Zhiren said:\n*\"To sustain the spirit*—\nthis is what is called *Playen Virtue/Power*.\nThe *spirit* refers to *hun* and *po*—\nthese must be nurtured.\nExcessive joy or anger harms the *hun*,\nexcessive fright or terror harms the *po*.\nPeace and tranquility extend longevity.\"*\n\nThe human body is like a boat, a raft, or a dwelling—\nit must contain the *hun* to nurture and guard the *po*,\nso they may return to unity, never to be parted even for a moment.\n\nTo act outwardly is to embody *De* (virtue/power),\nto spread inwardly is to manifest *De*—\nthis is called singularity without division.\n\nLet the *qi* be soft and harmonious,\nembracing purity and guarding it,\nso that one’s nature is like an infant’s longing for its tender mother,\nor a babe yet unspoiled by the world.\n\nWash away the filth of the heart,\nuntainted by even a speck of dust—\nboth good and evil vanish,\nmind and intention dissolve.\n\nHide your vessel and await its time.\n\nTo love the people and govern the realm\nis but an extension of cultivating oneself.\nHe who governs his body by cherishing his *qi* preserves his life,\nhe who governs the state by loving his people secures its peace.\n\nThe true nature of such a person shines luminous and clear,\npure and unblemished—\nwithin, it is radiant and transparent;\nwithout, it appears as simple as the unlearned.\n\n*Heaven* is one’s innate nature.\n*The Gate* refers to the opening and closing [of *qi*].\n\nThe enlightened see all paths as open—\nHeaven’s light is never without the radiance of sun and moon,\nwhile human enlightenment is the singular, undivided nature.\n\nYet there are those who remain ignorant and obscured.\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"To close the door is called *Kun* (Earth),\nto open the door is called *Qian* (Heaven).\nOpening and closing is called *change*,\nforward and backward without end is called *communication*.\nThe theory of *sheng-chu* (nourishing life) generates yin and yang\nand preserves the utmost essence—\nfrom non-being arises being.\"*\n\nTo act without self-reliance,\nto grow without domination—\nthis is the subtlety of *Playen Virtue/Power*.\n\n*The Doctrine of the Mean* states:\n*\"The noble person honors innate virtue/power\nand follows the Way of inquiry and learning,\nrealizing the vast and exhausting the subtle,\nattaining the highest clarity while embodying the Middle Way.\nRevering tradition while knowing the new,\ncultivating sincerity to uphold propriety—\nthus, though in high station, they are not proud,\nthough in low station, they do not rebel.\nWhen the state has the Way, their words suffice to revive it.\nWhen the state lacks the Way, their silence suffices to contain it.\"*\n\n*The Odes* say:\n*\"Both wise and enlightened,\nthey preserve themselves thus.\"*\nIs this not what is meant?\n\nYù Qīngzhōng said:\n*\"To sustain the *hun* and *po* is what is called *Playen Virtue/Power*.\"*\n\nFū Qí Línshì said:\n*\"*Hun* is the soul, the spirit.\n*Po* is the vital essence, the *qi*.\nThese three characters hold the profound meaning of *Laozi*.\n*Load* is like a cart bearing goods—\nplacing *load* above and *hun* and *po* below,\nit is like a riddle.\nIf *po* bears the *hun*, it becomes the common person;\nif *hun* bears the *po*, it becomes the sage.\nTogether, they are one;\nseparately, they are two.\n*Embrace* means to unite—\nif one can always unite and make them one,\nthe true essence will not scatter.\nOtherwise, unity is lost.\nThus, *Laozi* sternly warns:\n*'Can one truly avoid separation?*\nThis is like the precept in the *Sutra of the Ten Wholesome Actions*—\none must hold fast to *non-doing*.'\"\n\nOnly the sage retains the heart of the infant.\nThe infant’s heart is innate knowing and innate capacity—\nits *qi* is still and focused,\nyet gentle and yielding—\nthis is to say, it does not violently exhaust its *qi*.\nThus, it unites and makes them one.\n\nPurifying falsehoods, gazing into the mysterious—\nhow could there be any flaws to point out?\n\nTo govern the state and love the people,\none must be like Emperor Wen—\npersonally cultivating silent stillness,\ntransmitting the *Yellow Emperor-Laozi* tradition of pure tranquility.\nBeyond this lies only the toil of artificial action.\n\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate*\nis the passage for the circulation of vital essence.\nWhen pure yang prevails, it is the receptive yin.\nCan one truly avoid the yin?\nIt is only a concern that yin *qi* might overpower it.\n\nThough all paths are clear and open,\ntrue understanding lies not in prying scrutiny.\nNurture and cultivate—\nlife’s vitality flows naturally,\nyet one does not claim its merit;\nthings are accomplished effortlessly,\nyet one does not rely on one’s strength.\n\nThe *Dao-heart* eternally governs the body,\nwithout the labor of controlling all movements—\nthis is called the profound and mysterious virtue/power.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the practice of cultivating mind and nature,\nwithin which lie the methods for governing the state and loving the people.\n*Laozi* exhorts the rulers of his time to govern through natural *wuwei*,\nthus issuing warnings like *\"Can one truly avoid...\"*—\nall are words of admonition.\n\nSince the Three Dynasties, only Emperor Wen understood this.\n\nSpeaking of the *Heavenly Gate*—\nit is the gate of the Purple Palace at the North Celestial Pole.\nHeaven has the North Star within the Purple Palace,\nand within the palace, the Five Emperors reign in succession.\nThus, the Gate opens and closes—\nwhen open, it is *Tai* (harmony);\nwhen closed, it is *Pi* (obstruction).\nHence, in spring, the Green Emperor’s Gate opens,\nwhile the others remain closed.\nThe example of the four seasons is such—\nperhaps another interpretation exists.\n\nNow, I preserve both.\n\n「Xú Liùxū said: *\"Carrying the vital essence and embracing unity—can one truly avoid separation?\"*\n\nA person’s form carries soul and vital essence,\njust as a carriage carries goods.\nThe scripture speaks of *yíngpò* (vital essence) rather than *húnpò* (soul and vital essence),\nfor the soul governs movement—\nmovement is the capacity to vitalize and regulate all things.\nHence, it is called *yíngpò* (vital essence).\n\nThe *Nèiguān Jīng* (Scripture of Inner Observation) states:\n*\"Movement that vitalizes the body is called the soul;\nstillness that steadies the form is called the vital essence.\"*\nTo *\"embrace unity and avoid separation\"* is not to seek a separate *one* to hold,\nso that it does not depart.\nIt refers to the dual meanings of soul and vital essence diverging—\nthe soul wanders and shifts without constancy,\nwhile the vital essence remains fixed and unyielding.\nThus, the teaching is to hold them as one,\nso that soul and vital essence suffer no fault of deviation.\nIf so, then in movement, they are one;\nin stillness, they are one.\nWherever one goes, it is not separate from this unity—\nhow could there be any separation?\n\nTo concentrate *qi* and cultivate softness—\ncan one attain the state of an infant?\nWhen *jing* (essence) is concentrated and *qi* is vast,\nreaching the utmost in softness and harmony—\nlike an infant, who throughout the day\nknows nothing and recognizes nothing,\npure and complete, unspoiled and unspoiled,\n*qi* concentrated, mind unified,\nbones frail, sinews soft, yet grasp firm.\n\nTo purify and survey the mysteries—\ncan one remain without flaw?\n*Purification* means washing away one’s cravings and desires;\n*removal* means eliminating one’s likes and dislikes.\n*Mysteries* are Heaven;\n*survey* is illumination.\nWhen cravings and desires are extinguished,\nHeaven’s light naturally shines forth.\nTo illuminate the true source—\nif one can make it so that not a single flaw remains,\nthen it is well.\n*Flaw* is *disease*.\nIf even a single point is not cleansed,\nit becomes the root of the disease of confusion across lifetimes.\n\nThe above three passages speak of the essentials\nfor advancing one’s aspiration toward the Dao.\n\nThe following discusses the ruler’s love for the people\nand the Way of governing the state.\nTo love the people and govern the state—\ncan one truly avoid *wuwei* (inaction)?\n\nTo love the people and govern the state\nare two distinct matters.\nOne speaks of *wuwei* (inaction)—\nfor if a ruler loves the people through *wuwei*,\nthe people will be at ease;\nif a ruler governs the state through *wuwei*,\nthe state will be tranquil.\n*Wuwei* (inaction) is not passive silence or idle sitting—\nit means to benefit the people by what benefits them,\nso that love is vast;\nto govern the state by what the state requires,\nso that governance is grand.\nThis is true *wuwei*.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* (Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious) says:\n*\"Wuwei* means not acting before things have acted themselves.\"\nIt also says:\n*\"To follow is great; to act is petty.\"\nIf one seeks to love the people with small favors,\nor to govern the state with harsh laws and punishments,\nthen it is petty.\n\nAs for the *Heavenly Gate* opening and closing—\ncan one truly avoid *cī* (passivity/femininity)?\nThe *Heavenly Gate* is the great root of all under Heaven,\nthe source from which auspiciousness and inauspiciousness,\norder and chaos arise—\nthe natural doorway of creation and transformation.\nThe Dao has its passages of flow and blockage;\ntime has its *pǐ* (obstruction) and *tài* (harmony).\nThis is the natural principle of creation and transformation.\nJust as doors and gates are opened and closed,\ntheir timing cannot be measured.\nThe wise dwell in *cī* (passivity) and stillness,\nawaiting its course—\nthen nothing will fail to be good.\nOtherwise, they act as *xióng* (masculine/forceful) or as leaders,\nand often see disaster.\n\nTo be clear and open in all directions—\ncan one truly avoid *zhī* (knowing)?\nA ruler is intelligent, well-informed, and knows all things—\nclear and open in every direction.\nIf one can conceal one’s knowledge,\nentrusting it to the worthy while receiving their abilities,\nupright and dignified, with sleeves drawn low,\nthen the state is governed without laboring the mind,\nlongevity is extended, and all under Heaven is in harmony.\nTo nurture and preserve life until it reaches its utmost—\nthen it is not slaughtered.\nA ruler tends to the people,\nletting them live and nourish themselves naturally,\ncontent in tranquility—\nthus, it is said to nurture and preserve life.\nThough lenient and forgiving,\nit is because of their natural growth and sustenance—\none does not claim credit for it.\nAbove and below forget each other,\nthe people receive their blessings—\nthus, it is said to give life without possession.\nAll actions undertaken,\nwithout exception, are to benefit all under Heaven.\nWhen the work is accomplished and the affairs fulfilled,\none does not claim them as one’s own—\nthus, it is said to act without reliance.\nThe ruler is the leader of all the people.\nAs the leader of the people,\nyet issuing no commands to slaughter them—\nthe people know only of their ruler.\nThus, it is said: *\"Comfortably at ease\"*—\nhence, *\"long while not slaughtered.\"*\nThis is called *Xuān Dé* (Mysterious Virtue).\n*Xuān* is Heaven.\nIf a ruler cultivates himself thus,\nit is called *\"harmonizing with Heaven’s virtue.\"*\n\nChái Yuángāo said:\n*\"To carry the vital essence\"*—\nthe body carries the vital essence, just as a carriage carries goods.\nThe vital essence perceives likes and disturbs the body—\none must be cautious in carrying it,\nconstantly guarding against its overturning.\n*\"To embrace unity and avoid separation\"*—\nthe mind does not split its focus,\nso that the *Gǔshén* (Vital Spirit of the Valleys) remains active.\n*\"To concentrate qi and attain softness\"*—\n*qi* does not disperse through the nose,\nso that *tāixī* (womb-breathing) is complete.\n*\"To purify and survey the mysteries\"*—\nthe spirit does not leak through the eyes,\nso that wisdom and resolve are perfected.\n\n*\"To love the people and govern the state\"*—\nthe ruler is not enslaved by physical form,\nso that sinews and bones grow strong.\n\n*\"The Heavenly Gate opens and closes\"*—\nif opening and closing proceed without interruption,\nthen one does not depart from the Mother.\n\n*\"To be clear and open in all directions\"*—\nif essence and *qi* do not leak from cleverness,\nthen the mind’s perception is profound.\n\n*\"To nurture and preserve life\"*—\nto excel in preservation and nourishment.\n*\"To give life without possession\"* is the utmost called *Xuān Dé* (Mysterious Virtue).\nIf one constantly preserves its essence\nand regulates its use,\nthen one’s virtues are not vainglorious\nwhile the vital essence is secure—\nthus, the cultivation of a sage’s virtue is achieved.\n\nSū Jìng said:\n*\"From ‘carrying the vital essence’ to ‘this is called Mysterious Virtue.’*\nThis chapter’s original intent by *Laozi*\nlies solely in *\"giving life without possession,\"*\n*\"acting without reliance,\"*\nand *\"long while not slaughtered.\"*\nYet the emphasis is placed on\n*\"carrying the vital essence and embracing unity\"* as the topic.\n*Yíng* means *dwelling*;\n*Pò* means *qi*.\n*Soul* is *spirit*.\nTo *\"carry\"* is like a carriage carrying goods;\n*\"yíng\"* is like *enfolding*.\nThe vital essence dwells within the body,\nthough the soul’s movements\nare always followed by the vital essence—\njust as goods are carried in a carriage when moving.\nThis is the unification of soul and vital essence.\nThe soul and vital essence should be united as one,\nnot separated into two.\nIf separated into two,\nthere may be soul without vital essence,\nor vital essence without soul—\nthe person is no longer a person and dies.\n\n*Laozi* thus sets forth analogies,\nspeaking of the five matters of soul and vital essence embracing unity.\nAn infant is pure, unified, soft, and good—\nits *qi* is concentrated, its softness extreme.\n*Extreme* means *ultimate.*»\n\nThus, one may make the soul and vital essence unite without separation—\nthis is *purity and firmness*.\n\nTo purify flaws and remove defilements, to gaze into the profound and obscure,\nis to seek out faults and blemishes.\nBut if one purifies and gazes without seeking faults,\nthen the soul and vital essence may unite without separation—\nthis is *non-attachment*.\n\nTo love the people and govern the state while acting through *wuwei* (non-action),\nthen clarity and stillness arise naturally,\nand the soul and vital essence may unite without separation—\nthis is *purity and clarity*.\n\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate*,\nthrough which *Heavenly Principle* emerges—\nwhen *yin* and *yang* interact in harmony,\nwhen *male* and *female* resonate together,\nwith principle present yet the mind absent,\nthen the soul and vital essence unite without separation—\nthis is *desirelessness*.\n\nTo be bright and far-reaching yet appear as if without knowledge or awareness,\nthen one conceals brilliance in obscurity,\nand the soul and vital essence may unite without separation—\nthis is *concealing brilliance*.\n\nIn essence, *purity and firmness*, *non-attachment*, *purity and clarity*,\n*desirelessness*, and *concealing brilliance*—\nthese five make the soul and vital essence naturally embrace unity.\nWhen the soul and vital essence embrace unity,\nthey become the source of *generative life*.\n\n*Heaven’s Dao* takes nurturing all things as its intent,\nyet especially cherishes humanity.\nTo give birth and nourish is *Heaven’s Dao*,\nyet if the soul and vital essence separate,\nlife cannot endure.\n*Laozi* teaches these five matters to humanity,\nwhile *Heaven and Earth’s* benevolent generation is boundless.\nYet *Heaven’s Dao* gives birth without possessing—\nhow could it claim credit for its generative power?\nIt acts without relying—\nhow could it boast of its deeds?\nThough it stands as sovereign over all things,\nit harbors no masterful intent—\nthis is called the *mysterious virtue*.\n\nTo take the unity of soul and vital essence as the root of generative life,\nand to possess without claiming, act without relying, govern without dominating,\nis to have no room for the mind.\nThe grace of giving birth and nourishing\nis shared equally by *Heaven* and the *Sage*—\nthus speaks *Ben Yi An*, the recluse of the *One Root Lodge*:\n*\"From ‘carrying the vital essence and soul’ to this point is called the *Mysterious Virtue*.\"*\n\nThe meaning of *soul* and *vital essence* has been thoroughly expounded by earlier scholars.\nIn my view, regarding the *Rites’* sacrificial rites, *Confucius* said:\n*\"The vital essence is the flourishing of the spirit.\"*\n*Zheng Xuan* annotated:\n*\"The vital essence is the luminous clarity of the ears and eyes.\"*\nThis is the most concise explanation.\n*Zhu Xi* said that *vital essence* (*ying*) is akin to *ying* (glowing),\nmeaning radiant brilliance—\nthus, *vital essence* and *soul* are the spiritual essence of the form.\nHuman form gives rise to spirit,\nand the luminous clarity of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth\nall originate from *One Nature*—\nwhat the *Buddhist School* calls *Elemental Essence*.\nIt divides into the six harmonized faculties from a single clarity—\nyet because it is drawn by external things,\nit drifts and forgets its return,\nthus the form decays externally while awareness falters internally,\nand suddenly, death comes.\nThe soul ascends, the vital essence descends—\nthey can no longer reunite.\nTo die without forgetting is difficult indeed.\n\nThus, the enlightened one gathers vision and returns hearing,\nreverses light to illuminate the source,\nand restores the origin of *One Nature*.\n*\"Carrying\"* means dwelling steadfast without scattering.\n*\"Embracing\"* means preserving unity without loss.\n*One* refers to *Nature*—\nwhat the *Buddhist School* calls *Returning the Flow to Wholeness*,\nwhere the six faculties do not act,\nand clarity does not follow the roots—\nthis is *illuminating the root and emitting light*.\nTo illuminate the root and emit light is to *carry the vital essence and soul*.\nTo return the flow to wholeness is to *embrace unity without separation*.\nThis is the essential path to *restoring Nature and embodying form*—\nnot merely the true cultivation of refining form and spirit for longevity and sharp vision.\n\n*Specialization* means *unmixed*.\n*Extreme* means *ultimate*.\nAn infant, untempted by knowledge or thought to disturb its *qi*,\nthus its *qi* is *specialized*.\nUnburdened by competition between self and other to harm its softness,\nthus its softness is *extreme*.\nThough humans may strive to maintain gentle *qi*,\nthey can manage it temporarily but not perpetually—\nonly as an infant is it truly *extreme*.\nThese two aspects both return to the beginning of life,\nand only through purification and profound contemplation\ndoes the divine attain its ultimate function.\nFor purification removes dust and defilement—\ntruly, the original clarity emerges from this.\nIf even a speck of external filth remains unexhausted,\nthen wisdom is obscured;\nif even a hair’s breadth of imperfection lingers,\nonly purification can resolve it—\nuntil the mind and eyes become luminously clear,\nthen one perceives all things with penetrating vision.\nThe pure remain pure,\nthe impure become pure—\nno selection, no perception of flaws—\nthis is *ultimate*.\n\nHaving perfected self-cultivation thus,\none extends it to govern the world and respond to affairs,\nloving the people and ruling the state—\nthis is the norm.\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate*—\nthis is its transformation.\nAs the *Yijing* says:\n*\"One closing, one opening—this is called transformation.\"*\nTo be *female* is to be harmonious without initiating,\nto follow without leading—\nin its constancy, there is no trace of action.\nIn its response to change, there is no intent to precede things.\nFor there is neither anticipation nor resistance—\none simply abides in natural ease.\n\nTo be bright and far-reaching yet appear without knowledge,\nthis is called *\"wise and insightful, yet guarded by simplicity.\"*\nTo give birth and nourish is *virtue*.\nTo give birth without possessing,\nto act without relying,\nto lead without dominating—\nthis is *virtue* without the mind of *virtue*—\nthis is the *mysterious virtue* of *virtue*.\n\n*Laozi’s* this chapter #2\nencompasses the *Dao* of governing the body and the state.\n\n*Lu Yu* of *Shi Yi* says:\n*\"‘Carrying’ originates from *Heaven*—\nthe beginning of the discourse.\"*\n*Shi Tan* says:\n*\"Carrying the vital essence and soul, embracing unity—\nhow could they separate?\"*\n*Vital essence*, in ancient annotations, is taken as *soul*.\nFor the *soul* is the moon’s luminosity,\nthe *vital essence* is the moon’s shadow.\nThe moon receives sunlight to become luminous,\nthe shadow must carry the luminosity to live without dying.\n*Embracing unity* means the vital essence and soul merge as one,\nnever separating.\nTo specialize *qi* and achieve ultimate softness,\none must be like an infant.\nHumans are endowed with form and *qi* to live,\nyet when *yang qi* flourishes uncontrollably,\nit cannot be self-regulated and inevitably drifts,\nlosing its true essence.\nOnly by specializing and guarding one’s *qi*,\nmaking it soft as an infant—\nthough it may move, it does not know the union of *male* and *female*—\nis this well done.\nThis aligns with the later text:\n*\"The depth of virtue is compared to that of an infant.\"*\n\nTo purify and gaze profoundly,\none must be without blemish.\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The mind perceives all things,\neasily moved by external influences—\nthus, one must purify external desires,\nleaving no trace of flaw or defect.\"*\n\n「To cherish the people and govern the state,\none must attain *wuwei* [無為].\n\nThe ancient commentary states:\n*\"For those who cultivate the body, cherishing the *qi* ensures bodily integrity;\nfor those who govern the people, cherishing the people ensures the state’s security.\"\nThis encompasses both meanings.\n\nTo attain *wuwei* in terms of cultivating the body,\nit means the *Way* [道] is applied without excessive effort—\nas seen in the previous chapter.\nIn terms of governing the people,\nit is the *Way* of *\"governing through non-action\"* [無為而治].\n\nHowever, the *Master of the Yellow River* [河上公] rendered it as *\"without knowing\"* [無知],\nwhich aligns with the following passage.\nYet, *\"without knowing\"* [無知] should be interpreted as *\"without acting\"*

spirit and cherishing *qi*, unadulterated—thus without blemish.\nThis chapter elucidates the utility of *non-use* and the efficacy of *use*, their mutual reliance establishing function.\nThus, *Heaven* [乾] and *Earth* [坤] are the profound essence of the *Great Transformation* [大易],\nand the *yoke and axle* [辕厢] embody the substance of *non-use*.\nThey are likened to *vehicles, vessels, and chambers*—\ntheir efficacy lies in the interplay of *having* and *non-having*.\n\n**Du Guāngtíng’s Explanation:**\nCherishing *qi* and nurturing the spirit upholds *tranquility*.\nThe utility of *non-use* and the efficacy of *use* lie in their mutual reliance—\ntaking from what exists while leveraging what is absent.\n\nThe three—*vehicles, vessels, and chambers*—\nall borrow their *having* to exploit their *non-having* for function.\n*Vehicles* convey, *vessels* contain, *chambers* shelter—\nthe mind relies on external *having* while harnessing internal *non-having*,\nthus accomplishing the efficacy of *use*.\n\n*Heaven* and *Earth* are the foundation of the *Great Transformation* [大易],\nas stated in the *\"Systematic Transmission\"* [□系辞].\nThe *Great Transformation*’s establishment originates from *Heaven* and *Earth*.\nWithout *Heaven* and *Earth*, the *Dao* would have no foundation.\nThus, *Heaven* and *Earth* are the root and repository of the *Dao*,\nlike rivers and granaries storing its depths.\nHence, it is said: *\"When *Heaven* and *Earth* align, the *Great Transformation* stands within.\"*\n\nIf *Heaven* and *Earth* are destroyed, the *Great Transformation* cannot manifest.\nThis is akin to the *wheel-hub* and *yoke-axle*—\nif the *yoke-axle* is ruined, the *vehicle* cannot exist.\nTo illustrate the principle of *utility*, three analogies are given.\n\nFor governing the realm: if the people perish, the state collapses;\nif the people scatter, the state falters.\nFor cultivating the self: if the spirit departs, life ends;\nif the spirit dissipates, the body perishes.\nThe *Dao* of *utility* truly depends on mutual reliance.\n\n**Zhāng Chōngyìng’s Interpretation:**\n*Non-use* is *emptiness*—\nif *qi* were not empty, it could not circulate and transform into spirit.\nThus, it is called *\"non-use.\"*\n\nThirty spokes converge at one hub—\nits *emptiness* yields the *vehicle*’s function.\n*Clay molded into vessels*—\nits *emptiness* yields the *vessel*’s function.\n*Doors and windows carved for chambers*—\nits *emptiness* yields the *chamber*’s function.\nThus, *having* provides *utility*, while *non-having* enables *use*.\n\n**Riverbank Master’s Explanation:**\nThirty spokes converge at one hub—\nancient *vehicles* had thirty spokes, following the lunar cycle’s count.\nThey converge at the hub because its *emptiness* allows them to unite.\nFor cultivating the self, one must purge emotions and desires,\nleaving the five *zàng*-organs empty—\nthus the spirit returns.\nFor governing the state, few leaders unite many subjects,\nmaking the strong serve the weak.\nWhen *emptiness* prevails, the *vehicle*’s function emerges.\n*Emptiness* means *void*—\nthe hub’s void allows movement;\nthe *zàng*-organs’ void permits bearing burdens.\n\n*Clay molded into vessels*—\n*Bié* (harmonizing) and *zhì* (earth) form drinking and eating utensils.\nTheir *emptiness* yields their function—\nthe vessel’s void allows containment.\n\n*Doors and windows carved for chambers*—\nreferring to constructed dwellings.\nTheir *emptiness* yields their function—\ndoors and windows’ void permits entry and exit;\nthe chamber’s void permits residence.\nThus, *having* provides *utility*—\nbenefiting form and function,\nfearing the vessel’s collapse or the body’s decay.\n*Non-having* enables *use*—\nonly the void can contain all things.\nThus, *\"emptiness governs the formed.\"*\n\nThe *Dao* is *emptiness*.\n**Wáng Fǔsì’s Statement:**\nFrom *thirty spokes* to the *vehicle*’s function—\nthe hub’s *emptiness* unifies the spokes,\nallowing the solid to govern the many.\nFrom *clay molded into vessels* to *non-having* as *use*—\nwood and clay form walls,\nyet all rely on *emptiness* for function.\nThus, *non-having* is the foundation of *having*’s *utility*.\n\n**Emperor Xuānzōng’s Further Explanation:**\nFrom *thirty spokes* to the *vehicle*’s function—\nthis demonstrates how *having* and *non-having*’s efficacy relies on mutual support.\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\nillustrating how the few govern the many.\nThe *yoke-axle*’s *having* forms the *vehicle*,\nwhile the *vehicle*’s *emptiness* enables movement.\nWithout the *yoke-axle*’s *having*, there would be no *vehicle* to utilize.\nIf the *vehicle* were not empty, the *yoke-axle*’s *having* would be useless.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThirty spokes pierce one hub—\nthe few govern the many.\nWhen empty, the *vehicle*’s movement is realized—\n*non-having* benefits *having*.\nWhat is the *Dao*?\nIt is the ultimate *emptiness*, the ultimate *oneness*.\nThus, it moves and nurtures all things,\ncommanding myriad materials,\nmaking ten thousand distinctions coalesce—\nall from a single *image*.\nAll orifices resonate as one sound when struck—\nthe origin of all underheaven’s movement and transformation\nnever departs from ultimate *emptiness* and *oneness*.\n\nEven in *vehicles*:\nthe *yoke-axle* has substance, while the *vehicle*’s interior is empty.\nThe *vehicle*’s emptiness allows movement.\nWithout the *yoke-axle*’s substance, the *vehicle*’s function ceases.\nIf the *vehicle* were not empty, the *yoke-axle*’s parts would be discarded.\n\nThus, when *Heaven* and *Earth* align, the *Great Transformation*’s efficacy is manifest;\nwhen ten thousand transformations flow, the *Dao*’s utility shines.\nHence, through coarse analogies of *non-use*,\nthe utility of ultimate *emptiness* is illuminated.\n\n*Clay molded into vessels*—\nwhen empty, they serve their function.\n*Bié* (harmonizing) and *zhì* (earth)—\npotters blend earth to form *wǎ* (vessels).\n**Commentary:**\n*Bié* means *harmonizing*; *zhì* is *adhesive clay*.\nThe annotation cites the *Shàngshū*: *\"Molding earth is called *táo*.\"*\n\n「This speaks of the potter shaping and blending adhesive clay, then firing it to become vessels—\nit is the inner void that allows them to hold and receive things.\n\nCarving doors and windows yields the function of a dwelling.\nAncients dug caves for shelter, also opening doors and windows,\nhence the phrase *\"carve thus\"* (凿尔).\n**Commentary:**\n*Carve* (凿) means *to excavate*.\nWindows (牖) are side chambers or openings near doors.\nThe ancients dwelled in caves, so the *Shijing* says:\n*\"The potter digs and covers the cave,\"*\nmeaning he excavates the earth within the cave and covers it above—\nthus *\"carve thus\"* (凿尔).\n\nLater sages replaced this with official halls,\ntaking their inner void as the means for people to dwell.\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"If a dwelling has no void, mother-in-law and sister-in-law will jostle for passage,\"*\nmeaning they will fight over narrow paths.\n*The Erya* states:\n*\"The hall is called a dwelling.\"*\nThus, having form is for utility,\nwhile emptiness is for discarding.\nHaving form profits from emptiness,\nusing emptiness for profit;\nemptiness relies on form,\nusing form for function.\n\nWhat transcends form is called *Dao*,\nwhat is beneath form is called *instrument*.\nTo reveal the *Dao*’s function,\nit is clarified through form and substance.\nThus, by borrowing the coarse utility of having form to illustrate\nthe subtle function of ultimate emptiness—\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe profit of having form lies in its utility,\nwhile utility itself depends on emptiness,\nso having form profits from emptiness.\nThe function of emptiness relies on form,\nwhile form itself depends on having substance,\nso emptiness profits from having form.\n\nThe phrase *\"what transcends form is called Dao, what is beneath form is called instrument\"*—\nthis is the language of the *Yijing*’s *Xìcí Shū*.\n\n**Commentary:**\nFrom emptiness, it is called *Dao*;\nwhen touching upon substance, it is called *instrument*.\nTo clarify the *Dao*’s function,\none must approximate it through form and instrument.\nThough it borrows analogies from the three transformations,\nultimately, it relies on emptiness for one principle.\n\n*Du Guangting* says:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge to form the wheel’s function.\nThe hub gathers all spokes to complete the wheel,\nthe carriage gathers all materials to fulfill its purpose.\nWhat it uses is the carriage’s hollow interior—\nits emptiness.\nWithout the hub and spokes,\nthe carriage cannot be formed.\nNow that the carriage is formed,\nit empties its core to carry loads,\nillustrating how a sovereign internally relies on ministers’ counsel\nand externally delegates the aid of feudal lords\nto establish his realm—\nas the thirty spokes converge into one hub.\nOnce the realm is established,\nif he can empty his heart to embody the *Dao*,\nthen all under Heaven transforms harmoniously,\nlike the carriage’s hollow space.\nMan’s body,\nexternally depends on the hundred limbs’ arrangement,\ninternally relies on the five *qi*’s balance—\nlike the spokes converging to form a person.\nOnce the body is complete,\nif he can empty his heart to embody the *Dao*,\nthen the primal harmony subtly operates,\nand longevity is achieved.\nThis reveals how having and emptiness mutually profit and rely upon each other.\n\nThe *Dao*’s true singularity—\nno color, no sound—\nall types and materials depend on it to manifest.\nThe moving are the five spirits (灵), fur and feathers (毛羽), scales and shells (鳞甲), and winged insects (羽虫);\nthe growing are grasses and trees (草木).\n*Types* (类) refer to *forms*,\n*materials* (材) to *substance*.\nThough moving and growing forms and substances differ by myriad measures,\nit is the *Dao* that nurtures and gives rise to them all.\nThe *Dao* is but one essence.\n\nThe scripture says:\n*\"In the vague and indistinct, there is an image,\"*\nmeaning this true, pure singularity\ngives birth to all forms and substances.\nThough few in essence,\nit is the source from which the myriad arise.\n\nThe myriad orifices—\n*Zhuangzi*’s *\"Qíwù Piān\"* says:\n*The southern gate’s Zǐ Qí said to Zǐ Yóu:*\n*\"The Great Block exhales *qi*—\nits name is wind.\nWhen it does not act, it is still;\nwhen it acts, then all orifices roar and howl.\nThe orifices of a great tree, a hundred spans around,\nresemble a nose, a mouth, ears, and a window.\nWhen it is agitated, it makes sounds—\n*whoosh*, *hiss*, *shout*, *inhale*, *wail*, *roar*.\nA gentle breeze harmonizes the small orifices,\nwhile a gusting wind harmonizes the great ones.\nThus, though the sounds of all orifices differ vastly in scale,\nwhat stirs them is but one wind.\"*\n\nObserving all under Heaven’s movement and function—\nthe *Yijing*’s *Xìcí* says:\n*\"The sage perceives the movement of all under Heaven,\"*\nmeaning the sage possesses subtlety and mystery\nto see the myriad transformations of all things,\nand knows that all things’ generation and growth\nderive from the pure, singular, subtle *Dao*.\n\nThus, it is said:\n*\"It never departs from ultimate emptiness and singularity.\"*\n\nThis further elucidates:\n*\"When Heaven and Earth align, the *Great Transformation*’s efficacy is manifest,\"*\nand illustrates how the *yoke-axle*’s substance\ncompletes the carriage’s emptiness.\n\nAll transformations flow and function through the *Dao*’s utility.\nWithout the myriad transformations,\nthe *Dao*’s function would not be revealed—\njust as the *yoke-axle* serves the carriage’s purpose,\nand Heaven and Earth contain the *Yijing*’s essence.\n\nThe carriage is a common instrument,\neasily seen by all.\nUsing it as an analogy to illustrate the subtle *Dao*,\nhence it is called a *coarse analogy*.\n\nThe potter shapes clay into vessels—\nwhen empty, they serve their purpose.\nBlending earth to form vessels\nalso reveals how substance relies on emptiness for function.\n\nAll so-called *instruments* and *functions*,\nthough their forms differ by myriad measures—\nlarge, small, square, round—\nsome refined, some crude,\nsome cheap, some precious—\ntheir true function lies in the vessels’ inner emptiness.\n\nThe phrase *\"the potter shapes clay\"* (范土曰陶) is from the *Shàngshū*.\nWhen *Shun* tilled the *Lìshān* fields,\nhe farmed at *Lìshān* and pottered at the *Hé*’s banks—\nthis is the reference.\n*The Liexian Zhuan* says:\n*\"The potter and his disciples, Master Mén,\nwere all ancient potters.\nThey mastered the transformation of the five colors of fire\nand ascended to Heaven.\"*\n\n*Carving doors and windows* (凿户牖) yields the function of a dwelling.\nBefore dwellings existed,\nthe potter shaped the earth and covered it,\ndug the soil and hollowed it out—\nwhen father, son, husband, and wife dwell together, it is called a *family*.\nBefore there were sleeping halls or ancestral temples,\nnor were there *families* or *dwellings*—\n*covering* (复) means covering above the ground,\n*excavating* (凿) the earth below—\nall like the potter’s work.\nThe potter’s craft is today’s tile kilns.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s *Xìcí* says:\n*\"In ancient times, they dwelled in caves and lived in the wilds;\nlater sages replaced this with official halls.\"\nThis is derived from the *Dà Zhuàng* hexagram,\nwhich governs the construction of halls and dwellings\nduring the era of cave-dwelling and wild living—\nhence it is called *Dà Zhuàng*.\nThe *Yijing* speaks of the ancients,\nmeaning before halls and dwellings were built,\nthey only had summer nests and winter caves—\nthus, halls and dwellings were created to replace them,\nnot that later things superseded earlier ones.»\n\nThus it is said, *\"upper antiquity\"*—\nthat is, the time between **Fuxi** and **Huangdi**.\n\n*The Zhuangzi* [\"Thieves and Zhi\"] says that the Master spoke of the ancients,\nwho in summer nested in trees and in winter gathered acorns—\njust as it is written.\nWithin the nests and caves, they took the empty spaces for dwelling.\nNow, the halls and dwellings we construct also take their emptiness for habitation—\nhence it is said: *\"When there is no use for rooms, then there is room for use.\"*\n\n*\"Mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law treading each other’s paths\"*—\n*shè* (蹊) means a path or way,\n*bó* (勃) means anger or resentment.\nAs in *The Zhuangzi* [\"External Things\"], it says:\n*\"When the room is not empty, paths are narrow and confined,\nthen mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law quarrel over the way they walk.\"*\nA daughter-in-law should yield to her mother-in-law in harmony,\nas filial piety and respect demand.\nYet now they quarrel and rage over the path—\nthis is because the room is narrow and confined,\nwith no space for private movement,\nso they clash and fight instead.\nThis is called: *\"When rooms are narrow and not empty,\nmothers-in-law and daughters-in-law quarrel over the path.\"*\n\nWhen the heart is clogged and not empty,\nthen desires and cravings assail it in turn.\n*The Er Ya* says:\n*\"Palaces are called *shì* (室), and rooms are called *gōng* (宫).*\nTheir sizes differ in construction.\"\nNow, rites have been diminished and reduced—\nthe dwelling of the sage is called a *gōng* (palace),\nwhile common dwellings are called *jiāshè* (houses), *wūyǔ* (halls), *tángshì* (chambers and rooms), etc.\nAs the *Lunyu* commentary by **Huang Kan** explains:\n*\"Within the hall, partitions divide it into inner and outer spaces,\nseparating it into rooms.\"*\nThus, Confucius’ disciples were said to have *\"ascended the hall\"* or *\"entered the room.\"*\nSo the *táng* (hall) is the general term,\nwhile *shì* (room) is within it, further distinguished.\n\nThus, *having* is for utility,\nwhile *not having* is for function.\nThe *Dao* is without form—\nit relies on *having* to manifest its efficacy;\nwithout *having*, the *Dao*’s work would not be displayed.\nThings are with form—\nthey rely on the *Dao* to reveal their nature;\nwithout the *Dao*, things would not arise.\n\nThings cannot form and complete themselves without the *Dao*,\nand the *Dao* cannot display its function without things—\njust as with chariots, tools, and rooms:\nall take emptiness to benefit form,\nand rely on form to serve emptiness.\n\nThat which is above form is the origin of the *Dao*,\ndwelling in clarity and emptiness, doing nothing.\nThat which is below form is the function of the *Dao*,\nreceiving substance and taking shape below.\n\nThe *Dao*’s function is displayed through things,\nand things receive form, so they are called *qì* (instruments).\n*Qì* are the category of things with form.\nThe sage follows the *Dao*’s function,\ncrafting them into instruments:\ndrawing trigrams and observing symbols,\nestablishing writing,\nhollowing wood for boats,\ncarving wood for oars,\ncutting wood for pestles,\ndug earth for mortars,\nbending wood for bows,\ncarving wood for arrows,\nconstructing halls and dwellings,\nknotting nets,\nharnessing oxen and riding horses,\ncarrying burdens and traveling far,\ncasting metal for weapons,\nraising poles for flags,\nhewing wood for plows,\ntwisting wood for plowshares—\neach of these, used to benefit the world,\nare all divisions of the *Dao*’s function as instruments.\n\nThis is what the *Yijing* [\"Systematic Commentary\"] refers to:\n*\"The Dao is the name of the formless,\nform is the function of the having.\nAll things arise from the non-being,\nall forms are established by the Dao.\nFirst the Dao, then form—\nthe Dao is above form,\nform is below the Dao.\nThus, that which is above form is called the Dao,\nand that which is below form is called instruments.\nThough form stands at the boundary of Dao and instruments,\nit is above instruments, not the Dao itself.\nSince it has form and substance to serve as instruments,\nit is called ‘that which is below form’—instruments.\nThe Dao is non-being,\nform is being.\nBeing has limits,\nnon-being endures forever.\nThose who cultivate the Dao\nmust externally fortify their form to treasure their being,\ninternally preserve their spirit to venerate their non-being.\nGradually attuning to the subtle non-being,\nthey align with the Dao,\nand thus attain longevity.\"*\n\nThe *Dao* of the utmost unity and non-being,\nthings have symbols and forms as instruments.\nTo clarify the *Dao* through instruments,\nit again borrows metaphors from chariots, tools, and rooms—\nthreefold reversals.\nTheir use in non-being is all of one principle.\n\nWhen the sage governs the world,\nhe sets rewards and punishments,\nestablishes laws and decrees,\nissues teachings and clarifies hierarchy—\nthese are all *having*.\nYet if he governs in silence and stillness,\nemptily and calmly guiding people,\nwithout speaking to transform them,\nall things regulate themselves—\neven with rewards and punishments,\ninstitutions, teachings, and distinctions of rank,\nif they are not used,\nit can still be said to *\"borrow having to employ non-being.\"*\nThis is the utmost principle.\n\nIn cultivating oneself,\none follows the classics to awaken to reason,\nthen through enlightenment forgets words,\npenetrating the subtle gate—\nnot clinging to teachings—\nis this not the same meaning?\n\n**Song Dao Jun** said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at the hub’s function of non-being.\nHaving and non-being are in harmony,\nutility enters and exits—\nthis is called the utmost spirit.\nHaving and non-being differ in appearance,\ntheir substance lies in having,\ntheir function in non-being.\nThe operation of yin and yang,\nthe principle of all things.\nThe chariot’s use is in movement,\nthe instrument’s use is in containment,\nthe room’s use is in emptiness.\nMysterious function arises from utmost non-being,\ntransformation and change are hidden in no burden.\nLike a mirror with no image,\nit reflects things to display light.\nThe sage’s use of the heart\never resolves this truth.\nThus, having is for utility,\nnon-being is for function—\nhaving is solid,\nnon-being is empty.\nSolidity can embody form, appearance, sound, and color,\npossessing substance.\nEmptiness can move, measure, and respond without exhaustion.\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe *Dao* manifests through instruments,\nso non-being does not abandon having;\ninstruments rely on the *Dao*’s subtlety,\nso having must return to non-being.\nWood bends and water moistens,\nfire blazes and metal hardens,\nearth balances and grains flourish—\nthis is *having*, on which people depend for benefit.\nThe heavens move in their course,\nthe earth settles in its place,\nthe four seasons proceed in their order,\nall things flourish—\nwho is their master?\nThis is *non-being*, though the world does not perceive its traces.\nThus, having is never exhausted,\nand having and non-being generate each other.\"*\n\n**Laozi** expounds these three principles clearly.\n**Wang Anshi** said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at the hub’s function of non-being.\"*\n\nThe *Dao* has beginnings and endings.\nThe beginning is the source from which all things arise,\nthe ending is the means by which all things are completed.\nThe beginning emerges through natural spontaneity,\nunassisted by human effort,\nyet it is the source from which all things arise.\nThe ending involves form and function,\nthus it relies on human effort\nbefore all things can be completed.\n\nWhen the beginning requires no human effort\nyet all things arise from it,\nthen people may remain silent,\ndoing nothing.\nBut when the ending depends on human effort,\nthen sages must speak,\nmust act.\nThus, the sages of old,\nwho governed above and took all things as their responsibility,\nemployed four methods—ritual, music, punishment, and governance—\nthese are the means by which all things are completed.\nTherefore, sages focus only on refining\nthe methods that complete all things,\nnot speaking of those that give rise to them,\nfor birth comes from natural spontaneity,\nwhich cannot be altered by human effort.\n\nLaozi alone is different.\nHe believes that whatever involves form and function\nis unworthy of mention,\nunworthy of action.\nThus, he largely rejects ritual, music, punishment, and governance,\nand only speaks of the *Dao*.\nThis is a failure to discern the Way’s principles,\nyet he seeks lofty heights—\nan excess of ambition.\nWhat part of the *Dao* does he truly grasp?\nOnly when form and function are involved\nmust one depend on human speech,\non human action.\nHis text says:\n*\"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,\nyet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*\nThe hub’s usefulness is found\nwhere the wheel has no substance.\nYet a craftsman’s carving and shaping\nnever reaches that emptiness.\nFor emptiness comes from natural spontaneity,\nand human effort cannot alter it.\nThose who craft wheels today\nknow how to shape the hub and spokes,\nbut never touch the emptiness.\nYet wheels are completed—\nthe hub and spokes are present,\nand thus their use is realized.\nIf one knows emptiness as the source of use\nyet neglects the hub and spokes,\none is already distant from wisdom.\nNow, if one knows emptiness as the source of wheel-use,\nand emptiness as the source of world-use,\nyet does not know how to employ it,\nthen one is near to folly.\n\nSu Yingbin said:\n*\"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,\nyet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*\nExhausting wisdom and resources to create instruments,\nyet their true use lies in the emptiness within them.\nIf there is no emptiness, there is no use for emptiness to achieve.\nIf there is no instrument, there is no benefit to apply.\nThus, sages always observe emptiness to grasp its subtlety,\nand always observe instruments to perceive their boundaries.\nKnowing these two as one,\nyet inseparable,\nthen one has reached the utmost.\n\nLü Jipu said:\n*\"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,\nyet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*\nThe wheel’s hub turns, the spokes point straight—\nthese are the components that form the wheel.\nThirty spokes symbolize the moon’s phases.\n*Bing* (埏) is harmony, *zhi* (埴) is gathering.\nThe craftsman hollows doors and windows to make a room,\nyet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.\nThe room is where I dwell.\nWhen riding, I observe the wheel;\nwhen using, I observe the instrument;\nwhen residing, I observe the room—\nyet their true use is always found in emptiness.\nThe principle is not far removed.\nBut as for the body—\nhow do I know its use?\nThus, I rely on form for benefit,\nand emptiness for use.\nIf I depend solely on form for use,\nand emptiness for benefit,\nthen what is called benefit\nis also discarded and unused.\nIf I depend on emptiness for use,\nand form for benefit,\nthen what is called use\nis also harmful and not beneficial.\nThus, sages act within yet never possess,\nacting without yet never abandoning.\nThis is how emptiness becomes use,\nand form becomes benefit.\nTherefore, it is said:\n*Refine the essence to enter the divine,*\nto achieve use;\n*benefit and use secure the body,*\nto elevate virtue.\n\nLü Nongshi said:\n*\"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,\nyet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*\nForm and emptiness rely on each other,\nand cannot be considered in isolation.\nThus, without emptiness, one cannot employ form,\nand without form, one cannot perceive emptiness.\nIf one uses form for benefit,\nit may lead to stagnation,\nbut if one uses emptiness for use,\nits application is boundless.\n\nWang Yuanzé said:\n*\"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,\nyet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*\nThese three things—\nthe wheel, the vessel, and the room—\neither move, or store, or dwell,\nyet all derive their use from emptiness.\nEmptiness is merely the opposite of form,\nand form gives rise to emptiness.\nWithin emptiness,\nthere is a boundless subtle use,\na subtle function akin to greatness.\nForm possesses substance and shape,\nyet cannot respond to boundless needs.\nThus, one must rely on form for benefit,\nbenefit being the realm of the *yin*.\nAlthough this is the theory of form and emptiness,\npushed to its extreme,\nemptiness cannot exist apart from form.\nForm is also true emptiness,\nand neither form nor emptiness—\nthis is the true subtle mystery.\nLiu Zhongping said:\n*\"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,\nyet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*\nI rely on form for benefit,\nand emptiness for use.\nThe sage’s approach to the world is likewise.\nBy observing all its benefits,\none can then know its boundless use.\"*\n\n「The potter blends earth and shapes vessels,\nthen fires them—\nall these tools, carriages, and dwellings\nare but means to serve the *yin* benefit of form.\n\nYet the usefulness of carriages lies in both form and emptiness,\nthe benefit of dwellings in their vastness,\nwhile vessels, though few and slight in benefit,\nstill cannot be formed without relying on matter.\n\nFor all that serves a benefit—\nwhether much or little,\nwhether great or small—\narises from form alone.\n\nThirty spokes converge at the hub,\nyet its purpose is but the wheel.\nThough its benefits are manifold,\nthe hub’s core and the spokes’ alignment\nare not yet accounted for.\n\nThus, the *Zhou Officials* states:\n*\"A single vessel with two gatherings—\nthe wheel is the most complex.\"*\n\nIn ancient times, dwellings were dug from the earth,\ndoors carved for entry and exit,\nwindows pierced for ventilation.\nThese structures, shaped by *yin* and *yang*,\nestablished the order of rulers and subjects,\nparents and children,\nancestral temples,\ncourtly assemblies,\nand resting places—\nall hidden within completion,\nyet their benefits were vast indeed.\n\nHence, the *I Ching* says:\n*\"Later sages refined the world with roofs and walls,*\ntaking inspiration from *Great Strength* (*Tai Zhuang*).\"\nVessels like pots and jars belong to this category.\n\nYet even among these,\nfew are prized,\nmany are merely functional,\nthe round follows the compass,\nthe square the ruler,\nthe curved the hook,\nthe straight the plumb line—\nnone without benefit from form,\nthough their true use lies in the realm of emptiness.\n\nThe Master Lao expounds upon this,\nto reveal that though emptiness depends on form to manifest its use,\none cannot discard emptiness for the sake of benefit alone.\n\nThus, when form decays,\nemptiness remains.\nThe principle of benefit and use:\nunited, they are one;\nseparated, they are two.\n\nBenefit and use are not the same—\nbenefit is the realm of *yin*,\nwhile use is rooted in emptiness.\nThe wheel’s benefit lies in its form,\nthe vessel’s in its blending and shaping,\nthe dwelling’s in its doors and windows—\nyet their true use resides in emptiness.\n\nThis is why the sage *Mencius* said:\n*\"The ancient ways took benefit as their foundation,\nand the Great Yu’s drainage of waters\nwas but the removal of what was not needed.*\nHere, the use of emptiness is revealed.\n\nThe prior chapter spoke of *Mysterious Virtue* (*Xuande*),\nyet *Mysterious Virtue* is relative to emptiness—\nthus, it follows with the wheel’s thirty spokes converging at the hub.\n\nLiu Ji said:\n*\"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,\nyet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.\"*\n\nExalted Master Bian Que taught:\n*\"Within the human body are five *zang* organs,\nwhere the True Qi converges.*\nEach of the five *zang* is governed by six *qi*,\nthus the origin of the thirty-six convergence lies in them—\njust as the wheel’s thirty spokes.\nFlowing without ceasing,\nthey unite at the single hub,\nlike the thirty spokes converging at the hub.\n\nThe sage understands the pivot of transformation,\nusing form as its physical manifestation,\nthe body as a furnace,\nthe Three Palaces as tripods,\nand refining within the void—\nas boundless as the carriage one rides,\nthe vessels one employs,\nand the dwelling one inhabits.\nForm serves as the vessel,\nemptiness as the use.\nThus, form is for benefit,\nemptiness for use.\n\nThe ignorant of this age\nhear only of the Dao of abandoning the body,\nyet fail to grasp the subtlety of entering it.\nThis is why the Master Lao\nuses the wheel, vessels, and dwellings\nas detailed analogies.\n\nIt is like the *Qian* and *Kun* forming ranks,\nyet the *I Ching* stands within them—\nwhen *Qian* and *Kun* perish,\nthe *I Ching* cannot be seen;\nwhen form decays,\nthe spirit cannot be preserved—\nthis is why form and spirit must both be refined.\n\nThe sage uses form as its vessel,\nemptiness as its spirit,\nentering form to reach emptiness,\nand employing the false to attain the true.\n\nHow could mere appearance, name, or sound\nbe sufficient to grasp its essence?\nThus, it follows with the five colors.\n\nZhao Shizhen said:\n*\"First, it illustrates the principle that emptiness is the root of use:\nOne, to elucidate the *Qian* and *Kun* cycle of return.\nThirty spokes converge at the hub—\nwhen emptiness is present,\nthe wheel’s use emerges.\nThe Dao, though void, manifests as use;\nits function unseen,\nit relies on substance to reveal itself.\nThings, though solid, depend on voidness for their benefit;\ntheir emptiness unseen,\nthey borrow the void for their capacity.\nOne vessel, one use—\nmutually clarifying,\none and emptiness alone can truly manifest.\nThe use of emptiness is clear in principle,\nthe function of the void is unfathomable in Dao.\nThus, one knows that substance alone cannot serve as use,\nwhile voidness harmonizes with all things.\nUsing three objects to display the mechanism,\ntesting two aspects to glimpse the one—\nthe alchemical method follows the lunar cycle,\nadvancing and receding in thirty days,\nthen naturally waxing and waning.\n\nOne is the hub—\nthough it has form, it is not used.\nThirty are the spokes—\nthe count of the moon’s phases,\nall revolving around this principle.\n\nTo employ emptiness in guiding form—\nwithout the hub,\nthe spokes have no place to rest,\njust as the Dao governs time—\nwithout the days,\nthe moon would not arise.\nThe *yin* void depends on substance to borrow,\nits eclipses and waxings shaped by the interplay of light and dark.\nThe *yang* substance contains the void,\nnurturing the *yin* like a toad,\nand gestating the *moon* within the *yin* like a hare in shadow.\n\nThis is how the alchemist\ntakes the *Qian* and *Kun* cycle of return,\nand clarifies the benefits of form and emptiness.\n\nThe Dao originally has no image,\nyet alchemy arises naturally.\nThe hub and spokes illustrate the thirty-six principles,\nand the text expounds on form and emptiness\nas the foundation of benefit and use—\nthus, the adept of the Way\nresponds to all things through emptiness,\nwhile substance obstructs and does not flow.\n\nHence, emptiness is for benefit,\nform is for use.\n\nThe spokes and the hub\ncomprise the wheel’s complete structure.\nThe spokes’ use lies in the hub—\nvoidness guides all things,\nas if the hub were solid and the spokes hollow—\nwhere would they rest?\n\nAgain, it is said:\n*\"The wheel is beneath the house.\"*\nWhen emptiness is present,\nit refers to the void within the hub.\nWith solid spokes and an empty hub,\nthe wheel’s use emerges.\nWhen it moves without end,\nthen the wheel’s benefit is truly stored.\n\nThus, form is for benefit,\nemptiness for use.\n\nTwo, it points to blending and shaping.\nBlending and shaping create vessels—\nwhen emptiness is present,\nthe vessel’s use emerges.\nBlending and shaping mean\nmixing clay and kneading earth to form vessels—\ntoday’s pots and jars are examples.\nTheir emptiness is used—\nwhen they can be filled,\nthat is the vessel’s benefit.\n\nHeaven and Earth arise from the void,\nyet generate all things.\nThe Great Dao, though void,\nencompasses Heaven, Earth, and humanity,\nand with a void heart\nresponds to all existence.\nBlending and shaping use emptiness within\nto receive all things—\nthus, one knows that blending and shaping\nare the benefit of form,\nwhile emptiness within\nis the use of emptiness.»\n\n---\n\nHaving first clarified the meaning of the wheel’s hub and spokes,\nnow further elucidating the principle of blending and shaping,\nfor indeed the interplay of form and emptiness exhausts the Dao’s full function—\nits meaning profound and subtle, not easily comprehended.\nThis is the very nature of reality aligned with the Way of Heaven.\n\nThus, it further illustrates the principle of doors and windows.\n\n**Three: The Principle of Doors and Windows.**\nCarve doors and windows to make a hall—\nits emptiness is the void #1,\nyet it yields the use of a chamber.\nBarriers block the light,\nbut emptiness allows all things to be contained.\nIn all cases, one takes emptiness within for use.\n\nHalf a door becomes a door,\ncrossed wood becomes a window.\nDoors function by opening and closing,\nwindows serve by revealing light.\nIf doors and windows were not carved,\nhow would halls and chambers exist?\nRemoving obstructions creates emptiness,\nand chambers take this emptiness for dwelling—\nthus, doors and windows are for benefit,\nwhile chambers are for use.\nFor doors and windows provide the use of chambers,\nand only then can chambers be complete.\n\nYet it does not end with these three—\ntaking emptiness for use applies to all things.\nGrain stores are empty yet receive,\nflutes and keys are empty yet sound,\nvessels are empty yet hold,\nboats are hollow yet carry.\n\nThe Most High points to these three,\nand the rest may be inferred.\nLater, it clarifies the uses of form and emptiness.\nThus, form is for benefit,\nemptiness is for use.\nUsing vessels to manifest the Dao,\nthe Dao is then clearly seen within vessels.\nUsing emptiness as function,\nfunction is then not found in solidity.\n\nYet vessels cannot be destroyed—\nif vessels are destroyed, their use cannot be made clear.\nBorrowing things to make statements,\nwithout things, words have no foundation—\nthus, the wheel’s emptiness fulfills its function of transport,\ntaking the creative vigor of *Qian* to generate all things as its model.\nBlending and shaping have emptiness within for use,\ntaking the receptive emptiness of *Kun* to contain all things as its model.\nDoors and windows have chambers for use,\ncomparing the emptiness of the heart to supply all affairs as its model.\nThus, one knows emptiness itself has efficacy,\nthe Dao is revealed through vessels—\nwho would say the void is useless?\nThey do not know that daily use lies in emptiness.\n\nTo say only form and appearance are true,\nyet not know that form and appearance obscure their use.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The void is not destroyed, all things are real.\"*\nBenefit and use are both illuminated.\n\n*The System of Changes* says:\n*\"If *Qian* and *Kun* are destroyed, there will be no way to see the *Yi*.\"*\nWhen emptiness and reality illuminate each other,\nonly then does one know the pivot begins,\nobtaining the central harmony\nto respond to the boundless.\n\nShao Ruoyu said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at one hub—\nemptiness is their use.\"*\n\nLaozi, using the wheel, chambers, and vessels,\nillustrates the principles of things—\nform and emptiness, benefit and use.\nBorrowing form for benefit,\nwithin emptiness, the wondrous and inexhaustible use is revealed.\n\nTake the wheel, for instance—\ntoday’s eighteen spokes, ancient thirty,\nall converging at one hub to form a wheel.\nBorrowing the wheel for its tangible benefit,\nwithin its emptiness lies the wondrous function—\nin its rotation, one knows emptiness is the wheel’s use.\n\nBlending and shaping kneads clay to make vessels,\nborrowing vessels for their tangible benefit,\nwithin their emptiness lies the wondrous use—\nin their capacity to hold and store.\nThus, one knows emptiness is the vessel’s use.\n\nAncient dwellings were dug from earth,\ndoors were carved for entry and exit,\nwindows for viewing the outside—\nonly then were the institutions of rulers, ministers, parents, children,\nancestral temples, and feasts established as chambers.\nBorrowing chambers for their tangible benefit,\nwithin their emptiness lies the wondrous function—\nin their capacity for dwelling.\nThus, one knows emptiness is the chamber’s use.\n\nTherefore, form is taken for benefit,\nemptiness for wondrous use—\nthus, borrowing the phantom body for benefit,\nthe heart of no-mind for use.\nThis teaches the student to embody the logic of form and emptiness,\nto grasp the Dao’s benefit and use.\n\nWang Zhiran said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at one hub—\nemptiness is their use.\"*\n\nMankind, born into the cosmos,\nfaces urgent daily needs—\nthree things the body cannot do without:\nvehicles, tools, and dwellings.\nForm is for benefit,\nemptiness is for use.\nIf benefit and use are not properly aligned,\nthey become grave afflictions for the living.\n\nThose who do not understand must first consider what suits them,\nthen determine the right course.\n\nAs for vehicles, from the Son of Heaven to commoners,\neach has their due.\nThe Son of Heaven’s chariots are called \"ten thousand,\"*\nlords \"thousand,\"*\nministers \"hundred,\"*\nwhile commoners ride single-horse carts at most.\nFew is not lacking,\nbut excess is sure to transgress propriety—\nadding ornate decorations, embroidered reins,\nyet not calling it deceitful or disrupting norms—what else could it be?\nThus, the ancients valued simplicity,\nand even riding or walking followed ritual.\nHence, the Master walked when the Master walked,\nran when the Master ran—\nthe gentleman’s daily conduct never strayed from essentials.\n\nSome fed horses and oiled chariots,\nyet still seemed excessive in their extravagance,\ndeviating from the Sage’s pure and unadorned way of governing past and present.\nTo the point of hunting excursions,\nbreaking axles, wheels left unfinished—\nhow could such recklessness be fitting?\n\nAs for blending and shaping,\nit refers to molding clay and crafting pottery.\nThe ancients used what was sufficient,\ndiscarded what was spent—\nno hoarding, no waste.\nThe people found joy in food and drink alone.\nHow could they know the quality of their tools?\n\nIn recent times, however,\nstrange novelties are prized,\nwealth and ease sought above all—\nnone can match the age’s indulgence.\nYet even the sun’s warmth is not valued for its rarity,\nonly for its comfort to body and mouth—\npeople fail to heed the gradual loss.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Carve doors and windows to make a chamber.\"*\nThis refers to ancient dwellings in trees and caves—\ninitially to avoid cold and heat,\nto shelter from wind and rain.\nYet Emperor Yao built a three-step earthen platform,\nthatched roof untrimmed,\nand the people found contentment in their homes,\njoy in their customs—\nthus the land was in great harmony.\n\nThe Five Hegemons were not far removed from antiquity,\nyet their carved beams and towering eaves,\ntheir rafters reaching like clouds—\nthey still found their dwellings too narrow,\nashamed that their earthworks were not yet grand.\nThe hues of ochre and white left no craft unexploited,\nwhile the five granaries grew empty and tranquil without their knowing.\nTruly, they could not observe themselves through themselves,\ntheir households through their households,\ntheir villages through their villages,\ntheir states through their states,\nthe world through the world—\nlest they be lashed for their past mistakes.\n\nAlas! All know the use of what is *useful*,\nyet none grasp the use of what is *useless*.\nBeing and non-being, emptiness and substance,\nmutually lend each other form.\nWhen empty, no trace is seen;\nwhen traced, it arises from what is.\nSpeaking of non-being, how could one know\nthe source of traces?\n\nThus Laozi expounded these three principles\nto illuminate the ultimate of being and non-being, utility and use.\n\nA chariot excels in bearing,\na vessel in containing,\na dwelling in sheltering—\nall shaped forms are but *being*.\nLose it to non-being, and it cannot serve its purpose.\nLose it to being, and it cannot bring benefit.\nThus, non-being and being, utility and use—\neven the ancient sages took them as models.\nStudents must not deceive themselves.\n\nProgram Tai said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at a single nave—\nits use lies in the void.*\nThe function of storage is the chariot’s purpose.\nWhen spokes and nave are complete,\nonly then can it bear and carry.\nYet a chariot without spokes and nave\nlacks a foundation to reveal its function.\nBut examining its principle,\nthe grinding of earth and the turning of wheels\nlie beyond all material substance—\nthus, the chariot’s function belongs to non-being,\nnot to being.\n\nThat a vessel can contain,\nthat a dwelling can be inhabited—\ntheir use does not depend on being,\nbut arises from non-being.\nThe principle is one.\nThus Laozi spoke metaphorically\nto show the worth of non-being.\nIndeed, it is so.\n\nTherefore, the chariot-maker first prepares spokes and nave\nas its foundation,\nyet expects its function to lie beyond spokes and nave—\nin the realm of non-being.\nWhat is called *being* is sought to achieve it;\nwhat is called *non-being* is sought to transcend it.\n\n「This meaning is indeed a metaphor for Daoist learning—\nthe more one cultivates the Way, the greater the loss of rigid attachments,\nand its principle rests solely in the interplay of form and emptiness.\n\nThose who doubt Laozi’s teachings in the world\ndo so because they believe his \"non-being\" lacks substance,\nand thus cannot govern—\nthey fail to grasp that Laozi’s \"non-being\"\naims to transcend \"being\" in order to utilize it,\nnot to negate all form and function utterly from beginning to end.\n\nThe essence lies in the balance of intent and totality.\n\nThe words of King Linchuan [Wang Bi] state:\n*\"The chariot-maker knows to govern its spokes and nave,\nyet never seeks to grasp ‘non-being’—\nyet ‘non-being’ arises as its very function once spokes and nave are complete.\"*\n\nIf one were to discard the spokes and nave from the chariot,\nor abandon rites, music, punishments, and governance in the world,\nand seek \"non-being\" as their sole function,\nthen such reasoning is close to folly.\nThis is a misinterpretation of Laozi’s intent.\n\nLaozi’s teachings seek to fulfill the utility of rites and laws,\nwhile transcending them to achieve true function.\nHis words on \"being\" and \"non-being\"\nare akin to \"gain\" and \"loss.\"\n\nTo \"gain\" is to seek what one does not yet possess;\nto \"loss\" is to transform what one already has.\nThis is his application of chariot principles to human affairs.\n\nWhen one seeks \"being,\" it means accumulating trust and goodness\nto fill oneself,\nand to make them substantial and grand.\nWhen one seeks \"non-being,\" it means taking what is already full and transforming it,\nso that its traces vanish yet its function remains.\nThe phrases \"being\" and \"non-being\"\nrefer to the realm where human effort is applied.\n\nYet King Linchuan’s theory equates \"being\" and \"non-being\"\nto their completion,\nas if Laozi did not know that a chariot without wheels\ncannot be drawn or pushed.\nIndeed, Laozi’s words are subtle and difficult to fathom—\nthough King Linchuan most cherished his text,\nhe still erred in following the words while losing their meaning.\nThe calamity of the Western Jin [dynasty] stemmed precisely from this.\n\nThey took Laozi’s metaphorical language to belittle rites and laws,\nattaching themselves to the realm of discarding benevolence and righteousness.\nHearing of Laozi’s reverence for *wuwei* [non-action],\nthey hoped to govern without spokes and nave,\nas if a chariot could move itself.\nThey failed to understand that within metaphorical language lies true principle,\nand that *wuwei* [non-action] itself contains *wu buwei* [no non-action].\n\nHe merely sought to employ the spokes and nave\nto manifest the function of \"non-being,\"\nyet never abandoned them to neglect their \"being.\"\nLaozi’s teachings began to take effect in governance\nfrom the Han dynasty onward.\nWhen Cao Can [曹参] served Emperor Xuan [孝思],\nand Emperor Wen [文帝] succeeded Emperor Gao [高帝],\nthey achieved harmony through *qingjing* [tranquility and simplicity],\nand purity through *yuandu* [primordial stillness],\nthough they did not fully transform \"being\" into \"non-being,\"\nthey could still be said to have transcended form and substance\nto gather emptiness.\n\nYet their *qingjing* and *yuandu*\nwere not equivalent to abandoning all governance.\nThe foundational laws of Emperor Gao were still in place,\nand Xiao He’s [萧何] institutions remained.\nThus, the spokes and nave were already prepared in advance.\nHence, Cao Can and Emperor Wen could rely on their utility,\nachieving stillness when they wished and silence when they desired.\n\nIf one were to discard Emperor Gao’s laws\nand Xiao He’s regulations entirely,\nleaving all to indifference,\nthen the Western Jin would have already perished.\n\nHuang Maocai [黄茂材] said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at the hub to serve the function of ‘non-being.’\nThere is ‘being’ within ‘being,’ and ‘being’ within ‘non-being.’\n‘Being’ within ‘non-being’ has boundless function;\n‘being’ within ‘being’ offers great benefit.\nThe spokes and nave form the chariot,\nclay and mud shape the vessel,\ndoors and windows create the dwelling—\nthese are ‘being’ within ‘being,’\nupon which people depend for extensive utility.\nThough there may be no chariot, its function remains;\nthough there may be no vessel, its function remains;\nthough there may be no dwelling, its function remains—\nthis is ‘being’ within ‘non-being.’\nThe enlightened and accomplished rely on its boundless function.\nToday, texts like *The Parameters of the Same* [*参同契*] and *The Yellow Court Scripture* [*黄庭经*]\nabound with such sayings,\nfor they have their origins.\n\nZhan Qiupu [詹秋圃] said:\n*\"In ancient times, ten spokes converged at a single hub\nto serve the function of ‘non-being.’\nThe chapter ‘On Non-Action’ [无用] within *On Non-Action* [无用]\nstill contains practical application.\nThough a chariot with thirty spokes revolves harmoniously around one hub,\neven at the dawn of creation when there was no chariot,\nits function of bearing loads was already inherent—\nit cannot be discarded.\nThough clay and mud are molded into vessels,\neven at the beginning when there were no vessels,\ntheir function as containers was already present—\nit cannot be omitted.\nAgain, when doors, windows, and openings are carved to form dwellings,\neven at the time when there were no dwellings,\ntheir function as shelter was already there—\nhow much more so must one have refuge and rest!\nThese three [chariot, vessel, dwelling]\nderive their utility from earth and wood,\nyet their practical functions are ever-present.\nFrom ‘non-being’ to ‘being,’\n‘non-being’ is merely a means to harness utility for greater utility—\nthis is the function of ‘non-being.’\n\nZhang Chongying [张冲应] replied:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at the hub to serve the function of ‘non-being.’\nThe heavens possess the Six Qi [六气], the earth the Five Phases [五行].\nThe Six Qi are yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness.\nThe Five Phases are water, wood, fire, earth, and metal.\nWhen heaven and earth first divided,\nwater came first,\nand when humans first took form,\nwater was their foundation.\nWater governs the kidneys, the root of life.\nIn the earth, the number six generates wood,\nwood governs the liver, the abode of the soul.\nIn the earth, the number eight generates fire,\nfire governs the heart, the chamber of the spirit.\nIn the earth, the number two generates soil,\nsoil governs the spleen, the seat of intent.\nIn the earth, the number ten generates metal,\nmetal governs the lungs, the repository of the vital breath.\nIn the earth, the number four regenerates water.\nThe Five Phases in the earth, in their cyclic generation,\ncomprise thirty in total.\nThis is the *qi* [vital force] of the body,\nwhich moves and operates in accordance with it—\nwithout contradiction.\nThus it is said: ‘Thirty spokes converge at one hub,’\nmeaning that humans are confined within the earth’s framework,\nand the Five Phases, following the earth’s thirtyfold cycle,\noperate to ensure the Six Qi flow harmoniously—\njust as thirty spokes enable the hub’s rotation.\nOthers might say that the Five Phases generate in cycles,\nand the Six Qi harmonize in balance,\nand that five and six combine to form thirty.\nThe *qi* [vital force] moves itself—\nall are one explanation.\nYet the hub’s value lies in its rotation,\nand it cannot rotate if its core is hollowed out.\n»*\n\nThe Five Phases’ thirtyfold cycle does not generate through emptiness—\nthen how would the Six *Qi* move and circulate?\nThe hub moves through emptiness,\nand thus the chariot, through the hub’s rotation, can bear loads and serve its purpose;\nthe *qi* moves through emptiness,\nand thus the body, through the *qi*’s circulation, can nourish and serve its purpose.\nHence, from non-being arises being,\nand being is what is put to use.\n\nAs for earth forming vessels,\nif it does not blend water, wood, fire, and metal in empty harmony,\nit cannot contain its contents.\nCarving doors and windows to make a dwelling,\nif its halls are not left empty,\nit cannot house its inhabitants.\nThus it is said:\nWhen its emptiness is right, there is the chariot’s function;\nwhen its emptiness is right, there is the vessel’s function;\nwhen its emptiness is right, there is the chamber’s function.\n*\"Right\"* means aligning with their natural state.\nThe chariot can bear things,\nthe vessel can hold things,\nthe chamber can contain people—\nthese are the uses of being for utility.\nBeing is used for utility,\nyet it arises from the operation of emptiness.\n\nThe chariot, vessel, and chamber—\ntheir utility through emptiness is thus,\nand how much more so for humans,\nwho receive the Five Phases,\ncirculate the Six *Qi*,\nand transform into spirit?\n\nThis chapter is Laozi’s exposition of the fallen earthly form,\nto elucidate its meaning.\n\nZhang Lingying says:\nIn the human body, the essence above is like the spokes,\nthe *qi* like the hub.\nThe *qi* issues from non-being,\npropelling the essence-spokes,\nthe essence condenses into being,\nand together they revolve.\nWhen the *qi* ascends, the essence descends;\nwhen the essence ascends, the *qi* circulates.\nThey nourish each other without ceasing—\nyet the *qi* cannot be diminished by a single measure,\nnor the essence wasted by a single measure.\nSo long as non-being and being interact,\nunderstanding the spokes and hub’s function—\nwhat difficulty is there in longevity?\nFor essence belongs to yin,\nfollowing the earth’s thirtyfold cycle as thirty spokes.\nThe *qi* belongs to yang,\nfollowing heaven’s twofold cycle—\nfifteen as one hub.\nWithout the hub, how can the spokes turn?\nWithout the *qi*, how can the essence move?\nSuch is their function.\n\nBai Yuxian says:\nThirty spokes—\nlike thirty days.\nShared by one hub—\none month is thus.\nWhen its emptiness is right—\nmonths wax and wane.\nThe chariot’s use—\neven in small months, a month is complete.\nEarthen vessels—\nyin and yang interact, completing transformation.\nWhen its emptiness is right—\nheaven and earth lack no function,\nsages lack no ability.\nThe vessel’s use—\nthough sometimes insufficient, heaven’s work is seen.\nCarving doors and windows for a chamber—\nten thousand forms gathered in one net,\naligned with the celestial unity.\nWhen its emptiness is right—\nspirit does not guard its dwelling,\nthe five senses lose their watch.\nThe chamber’s use—\nsages and fools share the same nature,\ntheir wills turn inward to the external.\nThus being is used for utility—\nobtaining one’s parents’ body for function.\nEmptiness is used for utility—\npreserving the original, undivided nature,\nneither inner nor outer.\n\nLiao Cuiran says:\nThirty spokes—\nlike the sun and moon as a jade disk,\none month completing a heavenly revolution.\nShared by one hub—\nlike the body’s primordial *qi*,\nalso revolving once a month.\nWhen its emptiness is right—\nunified by the One.\n\n「The use of a carriage—\nit may serve as my conveyance.\nMolding clay to make a vessel—\nwith the *qi* of Yellow Court refining the soul and spirit,\nrefined by water and fire to form its substance.\nWhen its emptiness is right—\nthe Dao governs its use.\nThe use of a vessel—\nit may serve as my grand vessel.\nCarving doors and windows for a chamber—\nclearing paths for rear gates, for ease with water and fire.\nOpening windows at the *chǐ zhái* [measure of land], to commune with the divine.\nWhen its emptiness is right—\nit is used as a comparison.\n\nThe use of a chamber—\nit may serve as my divine abode.\nThus, the use of being is for advantage—\nthe *Tàishàng* [Supreme Venerable] speaks of its details.\nThe use of emptiness is for function—\nno need for heavy labor, no burden of annotations,\ntwo hands freely bestowed.\n\nChen Bìxū says:\nFrom the thirty spokes to the use of a carriage—\nthis illustrates the interplay of *you* [being] and *wú* [emptiness],\nmutually supporting each other.\n\nThe *Zhōulǐ* [Rites of Zhou] *Kāogōngjì* [Record of Crafts] states:\nThe carriage cover is round to symbolize heaven,\nthe carriage frame is square to follow earth.\nThirty spokes represent the count of one month.\nThe moon hangs in heaven, flowing endlessly.\nThe carriage wheels roll on earth, turning without bound.\nThus, ancient carriages symbolized the moon.\nMoreover, thirty days compose one month,\njust as thirty spokes unite at one hub.\n\nWhen the hub’s center is empty—\nthe wheels can turn,\nwhen the carriage’s interior is empty—\npeople can ride upon it.\nThus, its emptiness holds the use of turning and bearing.\n\nYán Jūnping says:\nIn the age of great antiquity, the sage ruled the people,\nfollowing the natural course of heaven and earth,\nwithout contrivance of cleverness.\nDrinking, they used gourds;\neating, they used their hands.\nAll things were equal, with no high or low.\n\nWhen kings began to act with purpose,\nthey imposed heavy burdens and laborious tasks,\nuntil the people were utterly exhausted.\nThe demands of the ruler were insatiable,\ntribute came from afar,\nmen and women laden with burdens,\nunable to bear the weight.\n\nThus, the wise crafted the wheel hub,\nharnessed horses and oxen,\nbore heavy loads and reached distant places,\neasing the people’s toil.\n\nLater generations followed suit,\nand craftsmanship grew ever more intricate—\npainted hubs and vermilion wheels,\nadorned with gold and silver,\nand embellished with jade pendants.\nThe cost of one carriage\ncould impoverish a household.\n\nHence, the *Lǎozǐ* [Old Master] lamented the harm of artificial creation to *moral virtue*,\nand illuminated how doing good breeds disorder.\n\nThus, he expounds on the three matters of carriage, vessel, and chamber,\nto explain how *you* and *wú* mutually support their uses,\nand offers warning accordingly.\n\nMolding clay to make a vessel—\nwhen its emptiness is right,\nit holds the use of a vessel.\n*Cóng* [molding] is harmony.\n*Zhí* [clay] is sticky earth.\nThe craftsman blends harmony with sticky earth,\nshapes it into vessels,\nand takes the emptiness within them—\nthis is the use of containing all things.\n\nYán Jūnping says:\nIn times when *moral virtue* and the Dao decline,\nworries assail the inner self,\nwhile yin and yang harm the outer.\nThe people grow weak and emaciated,\nplagued by sickness.\nThus, water and fire arise together,\nthe five flavors form in confusion,\nraw and cooked are not distinguished,\ndryness and dampness are not separated.\nHence, the wise mold earth into vessels,\nto cook sour and salty foods,\nand so reach the point of field hunting and decadent excess,\nravaging all living beings,\nhollowing wombs and slaughtering grains,\nto gratify the ruler’s desires,\nand carving jade into ornaments,\nfor cups and basins.\nAh! From simple vessels to such extravagance.\n\nCarving doors and windows for a chamber—\nwhen its emptiness is right,\nit holds the use of a chamber.\n*Záo* [carving] is piercing.\nThe half-door is called *hù*,\nthe window beside the door is called *yǒu*.\nDoor, window, half-door, and side-window—\nall are general terms.\nIn ancient times, dwellings were dug-out caves,\npiercing the earth within the hole to cover it above.\nMaking doors and windows was for habitation,\nand taking the emptiness within—\nthis is the use of resting, entering, and exiting.\n\nYán Jūnping says:\nOnce the human heart changes,\nall things harbor resentment,\nserpents and insects rise,\npoisons and calamities multiply,\nbeasts and wild animals harm the people.\nThus, caves and holes are insufficient\nto ward off calamities,\nto preserve life,\nor to complete one’s natural years.\nHence, the wise build dwellings—\nroofs above, eaves below,\npiercing windows for observation,\nfortifying gates and closing them tight,\nopening and shutting with swift ease,\nso that wasps and insects cannot enter,\nbeasts and wild animals cannot approach.\nLater, this led to ornate pavilions and perilous towers,\nthe *Āfáng* [Hall of Ease] palaces,\ngreat gates guarding strategic passes,\nand building walls for defense.\nSoldiers grow weary and exhausted,\nand countless die in the process.\nYet what was once deemed governance\nlater became seen as chaos—\nthis is the fault of *you* and *wú* mutually supporting their uses.\nIt lies in the hands of the people.\n\nThus, the use of *you* is for advantage,\nwhile the function of *wú* is for use.\nThis clarifies the three matters above,\nshowing how *you* and *wú* mutually support each other,\nand neither can be neglected.\n\nThe use of *you* is for advantage,\nwhile the function of *wú* is for utility.\nThe advantage of *you* lies in its outward form,\nwhich relies on windows and openings to manifest.\nThe utility of *wú* lies in its inward void,\nwhich depends on vessels and forms to fulfill its purpose.\nThus, *wú* relies on *you* for advantage,\nwhile *you* relies on *wú* for utility.\n\n*Wú* aligns with the Dao,\nwhile *you* forms the vessel.\nThe Dao, though formless,\nmust rely on *you* to display its power.\nIf *you* were absent, how could the Dao’s power be shown?\n\nThe vessel, though formed,\nmust rely on *wú* to complete its use.\nIf *wú* were lost, how could the vessel’s function be fulfilled?\n\nThus, vessels without the Dao cannot be applied,\nand the Dao without vessels cannot display its power—\njust as the hub has spokes,\nthe vessel contains things,\nand the chamber holds people.\nAll depend on *wú* to benefit *you*,\nand *you* to utilize *wú*.\n\nFurthermore, governing the body—\nthe spirit is the advantage for sustaining life,\nthe void is the function for gathering the spirit.\nThus, *wú* can govern and apply,\nwhile *you* can benefit and serve.\n\nBenefiting things lies in *you*,\nwhile governing and applying lies in *wú*.\nFor *wú* is the state of emptiness and tranquility.»\n\nThe *you* is what is called **divine luminosity**.\nDivine luminosity is the wondrous *you*,\nwhile the void and tranquility is the utmost *wú*.\n\nThe wondrous *you*’s virtue lies in its benefit,\nand that benefit is in sustaining life.\nThe utmost *wú*’s function is in its application,\nand that application is in gathering the divine luminosity.\nIndeed, the virtue of sustaining life and gathering the divine luminosity\ndo not exceed the realm of wondrous *you* and utmost *wú*.\n\nThus, it is said that *you* is used for its virtue,\nand *wú* is used for its function.\n\nXie Tuonan remarked:\n*\"The thirty spokes converge to fulfill their function.*\nThe wheel’s turning depends on the hub.\nThe thirty spokes unite at one hub,\nsymbolizing the thirty days that constitute a month.\n\nThings in their solidity rely on the void to move,\nthe spokes gather at the hub,\nthe hub turns within the void.\nThus, when it is merely *you*,\nit is insufficient to show the wheel’s function,\nbut *wú* is the very means by which the wheel’s function is realized.\n\n*Molding clay to form vessels is the ultimate function of *you*.*\n*Molding* refers to pottery,\n*clay* refers to earth.\nPottery shapes clay into vessels—useful things.\nYet vessels receive objects through their inner void.\nThus, when it is merely *you*,\nit is insufficient to show the vessel’s function,\nbut *wú* is the very means by which the vessel’s function is realized.\n\n*Carving doors and windows is the ultimate function of *you*.*\nThe *chamber* is where people dwell,\n*doors and windows* are the means of entry and exit.\nThe chamber’s inner void makes it habitable,\nthe door’s inner void makes it passable.\nWhen it is merely *you*,\nit is insufficient to show the chamber’s function,\nbut *wú* is the very means by which the chamber’s function is realized.\n\nThus, *you* is the ultimate means of function.\nWithout spokes, one cannot make a wheel;\nwithout clay, one cannot make a vessel;\nwithout doors and windows, one cannot make a chamber.\nTherefore, *you* is what brings virtue to the world,\nwhile *wú* is what brings function to the world.\nThe solid relies on the void to contain,\nthe *you* relies on the *wú* to move—\nthis is the principle.\n\nIndeed, I have discussed it:\nThe *you* above form is called the **Dao/Way**,\nthe *you* below form is called **vessel**.\nThe vessel takes shape through *you*,\nthe Dao/Way is concealed within *wú*,\nso *you* cannot move *you*,\nwhile *wú* is the very means by which *you*’s function is realized.\n\nAnd so it is with humanity.\nThe movement of the limbs is like the wheel’s spokes,\nthe arrangement of the chest and heart is like the chamber’s structure.\nIf there were merely solid things and *you*,\nwould that not be called a vessel?\nBut the **soul’s platform** is void within,\nthe means by which it contains all within and moves all without,\nand responds to limitless functions—\nthis is the case.\n\nOtherwise, it would be but a rigid mass,\nwhat use would it be?\n\nLin Yongzhai said:\n*\"The thirty spokes converge at one hub—\nthe utmost *wú* is what fulfills their function.*\nThe hub is the axle that holds the wheel,\nthe spokes are the ribs of the wheel.\nOnly because the hub is void within can the wheel move.\n\n*Molding clay to form vessels*—\npottery’s vessels are void within, thus can they be shaped.\n*Doors and windows*—\nthe luminous passages in the chamber.\nThese three examples all illustrate the void’s role in function.\nThus, it is said that *you* is used for its virtue,\nand *wú* is used for its function.\n\nWheels, vessels, and chambers—\nall are the virtues of solid *you*,\nyet their very nature as wheels, chambers, and vessels\ndepends on the void’s function within.\nWith this, the single character *wú* is wonderfully depicted.\n\nFan Yingyuan said:\n*\"The thirty spokes converge—\nthis is the utmost *you* that fulfills the wheel’s function.*\nThe spokes are the wheel’s rim.\nThe *Shuowen Jiezi* states:\n*The wheel is the rim;\nthe hub is where the spokes gather.*\nThis single character *wú* is a perfect verse,\nillustrating how things reveal the Dao’s boundless function.\nAncient artisans crafted vessels by following natural forms.\nThe wheel’s spokes numbered thirty,\nsymbolizing a month’s days.\nThe hub’s void and passage allow the wheel to turn.\nThus, the thirty spokes gathering at one hub—\nwhen the void is present, the wheel’s function is realized.\n\n*Molding clay to form vessels*—\nthis is the utmost *you* that fulfills the chamber’s function.\n*Molding* refers to blending,\n*clay* is sticky earth, as in the *Shuowen Jiezi*.\nIt means blending sticky earth to form vessels.\nHalf a door is called a *door*,\nintersecting wood is called a *window*.\nIf vessels are void within, they can hold objects;\nif chambers are void within, they can shelter people.\nThus, when the void is present,\nthe vessel’s and chamber’s functions are realized.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*'If a chamber lacks emptiness and void,*\n*then mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law will jostle within.*\n*'If the heart lacks boundless freedom,*\n*then the six senses will vie for dominance.*\nThis too uses things to illustrate the heart’s void and passage in function.\nThus, it is said that *you* is used for its virtue,\nand *wú* is used for its function.\n\nTherefore, all solid *you* is used for its virtue,\nwhile all void *wú* is used for its function.\nIt is not only wheels, vessels, and chambers that are so.\nHow can this be verified?\nMy body has form,\nyet within it, there are formless *wú* that fulfill its function.\nIt is not merely my body—\nall things in heaven and earth are the same.\n\nXue Yongqi said:\n*\"The thirty spokes converge at one hub—\nthe utmost *wú* is what fulfills their function.*\nThese three examples show *you* and *wú* mutually relying on each other for function.\n\nChu Boixiu said:\n*\"The thirty spokes converge at one hub—\nthe utmost *wú* is what fulfills their function.*\nThe hub and spokes form the wheel,\nthe void within carries objects.\nMolding clay forms vessels,\nthe void within stores objects.\nCarving doors and windows forms chambers,\nthe void within shelters people.\nTheir mutual reliance on *you* and *wú* for function is evident.\n\n*You* is the vessel—\nartificial, thus subject to creation and destruction.\n*Wú* is the Dao—\nnatural, thus without end.\nTake the human body:\nThe head, eyes, hands, and feet are all solid *you*,\nyet they all depend on the formless *wú* within to move.\nSeeing, hearing, grasping, walking,\nspeaking, and acting—\nall require the *wú* to function,\nso vast is the *wú*’s role.\n\nWhen life ends,\nthe body lies still in the great chamber,\nthe head, eyes, hands, and feet remain intact,\nyet the *wú* no longer moves them—\nno different from a wooden puppet—\nbecause the divine luminosity has departed,\nwhile the earthly frame remains.\n\nHowever, *you* and *wú* mutually rely on each other,\nand neither can be neglected.\nIf one were to take a mortal body\nto cultivate the **sage’s fruit**,\nby obstructing it to achieve utter void,\nwhat harm would there be?\n\nIn general, *you* is finite,\n*wú* is infinite—\nthis is why they differ in virtue and function.\n\nThe chapter expounds only the single character **無** (*wú*).\nIt is because of **無** (*wú*) that function is possible.\nAll things under heaven take form to achieve the work of vehicles and dwellings,\nyet rely on **無** (*wú*) for their essence and **有** (*yǒu*) for their utility—\nthen they are not confined merely to vehicles and dwellings alone.\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"Obtain its central pivot to respond to the boundless.\"*\nAll are skilled in establishing metaphors.\nSome interpret the thirty spokes as corresponding to the number of days in a month,\na later passage finding it forced and awkward.\n\nOthers take **無有** (*wúyǒu*) as *\"not yet having\"* and cite the *Yì* [□] *Xìyǔ* [系辞] on the advantage of boats and oars,\ntaken from the *Hàn* [涣] hexagram,\nand *\"riding oxen, mounting horses,\"*\ntaken from the *Suí* [随] hexagram,\nas proof—\nsaying that even before these implements existed,\ntheir functional principle was already present.\nThis is another view.\n\nNiu Miao’s *Transmission* states: *\"The thirty spokes yield the use of a chariot.\"*\nA single chariot has thirty spokes,\nand a month has thirty days.\nWhen it speaks of the chariot hub,\nit refers to the sun and moon.\nIf spoken of in terms of **道** (*Dào*),\nthen before the Great Primordium (*Dàpuǎo*) had yet divided,\nbefore heaven and earth had roots,\nbefore the sun and moon shone,\nthere was originally no use of sun and moon.\n\nIn terms of implements and utility,\nthe Age of Great Simplicity (*Shànggǔ Chúnpǔ*)\nwas pure and unknowing,\nwith no use of chariot hubs for turning or transporting.\nIt was only from the Yellow Emperor onward,\nobserving the revolving of the wild grass (*péng*),\nthat he fashioned the chariot\nto bear heavy loads and reach distant places.\nLater generations, indulgent in luxury,\nadorned it with gold and jade,\nand painted its hubs with vermilion and cinnabar.\nThe Most High Sage (*Tàishàng*)\nwitnessed the customs growing extravagant,\nthe purity of antiquity fading,\nand thus composed this sigh:\n*\"When there was yet no chariot,\nits use was already present.\"*\n\nMolding clay to make vessels,\nwhen there was yet no vessel,\nits use was already present.\n*\"Molding\"* means blending,\n*\"clay\"* refers to earth—\nit speaks of blending earth to make vessels.\nVessels (*qìng*) are the tripod vessels.\nAncient people took heaven and earth as the divine tripod vessel,\nand the sun and moon as its windows and doors.\n\nIf spoken of in terms of **道** (*Dào*),\nthen before the Great Polarity (*Tàijí*) had yet been distinguished,\nthere was originally no heaven and earth, no sun and moon—\nthat was **道** (*Dào*).\n\nIn terms of dwellings,\nthe Age of Great Simplicity had no palaces,\nsummer dwellings were boats and nests,\nwinter dwellings were caves and burrows.\nLater sages transformed them into palaces,\nwith lofty beams and eaves to shelter against wind and rain.\nFrom the Middle Ages onward,\ncustoms grew refined yet decadent,\nluxury and extravagance flourished,\npalaces sprawled in intricate layers,\ntowers soared in dizzying heights,\nemotions ran wild, desires unbounded,\npushing excess to its utmost.\nThe Most High Sage lamented the decline of the age,\nand thus sighed:\n*\"When there was yet no dwelling,\nits use was already present.\"*\n\nThus, **有** (*yǒu*) is relied upon for utility,\nwhile **無** (*wú*) is relied upon for function.\n**有** (*yǒu*) refers to the sun and moon\nturning and moving to bring forth cold and heat,\nto heaven and earth as the divine tripod vessel\nto refine and transform all things,\nto the divine dwelling under heaven\nto shelter and nourish all beings,\nto the chariot hub bearing and transporting\nto facilitate its turning,\nto vessels and utensils\nto aid in drinking and eating,\nto dwellings and windows\nto replace nests and caves.\n\nAll these are the sages’ preparation of things and realization of utility\nto benefit the world.\nThus it is said: *\"**有** (*yǒu*) is relied upon for utility.\"*\n\n**無** (*wú*) is relied upon for function,\nmeaning when heaven and earth and all things were yet **無** (*wú*),\nonly **道** (*Dào*) was empty and boundless.\nIt is because of this emptiness and boundlessness that function is realized,\nand thus it is said: *\"**無** (*wú*) is relied upon for function.\"*\n\nThe **休休庵** (*Xiūxiū’ān*) commentary states:\n*\"From the thirty spokes to **無** (*wú*) relied upon for function.\"*\nAwakening to the Great Dao is called *\"obtaining the body.\"*\nOne must also obtain function.\nObtaining the body but not function is called *\"dead matter.\"*\nObtaining function but not the body is called *\"playing with affairs.\"*\nRecognizing **德** (*virtue/power*) and **道** (*Dào*),\nbody and function complete,\nis called a *\"sage of insight.\"*\n\nThe **Old Master** (*Lǎozi*) uniquely uses the metaphors of chariot-making and window-carving\nto illustrate **無** (*wú*)’s wondrous function,\nbenefiting and saving the world.\nThus all deeds of those who follow the **道** (*Dào*) are beneficial.\n\nIn the world, what is **無** (*wú*) is obtained for use,\nabandoning **道** (*Dào*) and **德** (*virtue/power*),\nhow then could one complete the human world?\n\nYang Zhìrén says:\n*\"From the thirty spokes to **無** (*wú*) relied upon for function.\"*\nIt refers to the chariot wheel.\nThe thirty spokes follow the pattern of a month’s days.\nThe wheel is the mechanism,\nthe turning is its function.\nHeaven uses the Big Dipper as its mechanism,\nhumans use the mind as theirs,\ngathering the original spirit as spokes around the central palace,\nletting the true **氣** (*qi*) flow and move through the body,\nrevolving and transforming creation,\nconcentrating the Five Phases,\nharmonizing the Four Symbols—\nall are the uses of the chariot.\n\n*\"Molding clay\"* refers to the potter’s wheel,\na metaphor for the same mechanism.\nWithout this wheel, how could vessels be made?\nIf humans vary their mechanisms at the central pass,\nthe **栲子** (*kēngzi*) will turn everywhere without obstruction.\n\n*\"Windows and doors\"* are apertures.\nIt is like the birth of **混沌** (*Hùndùn*),\na formless mass.\nIf one were to carve an aperture daily,\nby the seventh day **混沌** (*Hùndùn*) would die.\nHumans have seven apertures;\nretracting vision inward brings life,\nletting it loose outward brings death.\n\nThus the doctrine of **有** (*yǒu*) and **無** (*wú*) is spoken of by humans.\nIf one applies **無** (*wú*) to all things,\n**無** (*wú*) generates **有** (*yǒu*),\nand obtains its function.\n\n**無** (*wú*) within **有** (*yǒu*) harmonizes wonderfully with the Primordial.\nYet when it speaks of **有** (*yǒu*),\nit means **無** (*wú*)’s defects.\n\nTo possess a single eye within the realm of **有** (*yǒu*) and **無** (*wú*)—\nonly then is one truly at the core of the matter.\n\n**無** (*wú*) is the means by which all things function.\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Does Heaven move itself?\nDoes Earth settle itself?\nDo the sun and moon vie for their places?\nWho directs this?\nWho holds the reins?\nWho remains in stillness?\nWhen pushed into motion—\nis it because of some inherent mechanism?\nOr because it is bound by necessity?\nOr because it moves and cannot stop itself?\"*\n\nQingzhong further explained:\n*\"The thirty spokes converge at the void for their function.\nAll things under Heaven do not arise from **有** (*yǒu*) alone,\nbut from **無** (*wú*).\nWhen at **無** (*wú*), read it as a single phrase.\nAt the time of the thirty spokes,\nthere is yet no utility of the chariot.\nYet the chariot’s function already resides within.\nThus it is said: ‘the function of the chariot.’\nWhen shaping clay into vessels,\nthere is yet no utility of the utensil.\nYet the utensil’s function already resides within.\nThus it is said: ‘the function of the utensil.’\nWhen carving doors and windows,\nthere is yet no utility of the dwelling.\nYet the dwelling’s function already resides within.\nThus it is said: ‘the function of the dwelling.’*\n\nAccording to the *Zhou Li* [*考工记*]:\n*\"The chariot’s canopy is round to emulate Heaven,\nthe carriage’s base is square to emulate Earth,\nand the thirty spokes symbolize the phases of the moon.\nThe **毂** (*gǔ*) is the central axle of the chariot,\nwhere the spokes converge to form the wheel.\n**埏** (*kēng*) means to blend,\n**埴** (*zhí*) is clay.\nThe potter turns and shapes to create vessels.\n**凿** (*záo*) means to pierce.\nHalf a door is called a **户** (*hù*),\nwindows beside the door are called **牖** (*yǒu*).\nAnother interpretation: **無** (*wú*) is emptiness, is void.\nWhen the **毂** (*gǔ*) is hollow and empty,\nthe wheel can turn;\nwhen the chariot is hollow and empty,\nit can carry people.\nThus, where there is emptiness and void,\nthere is the function of movement and bearing.\nWhen shaping vessels, the exterior is solid while the interior is hollow.\nWhere the vessel’s emptiness resides,\nthere is the function of containing things.\nIn ancient times, people lived in caves,\ndug out earth to cover their dwellings,\nand thus created the design of doors and windows.\nWhere the dwelling’s emptiness resides,\nthere is the function of habitation and passage.\nThus, **有** (*yǒu*) is used for utility,\nand **無** (*wú*) is used for function.\nThe utility of vessels lies in their form,\nwhile the function of **無** (*wú*) lies in the void.\nFor vessels to be useful,\ntheir utility must manifest outwardly,\nrelying on emptiness for function.\nFor emptiness to serve its purpose,\nit must be hollow within,\nborrowing the vessel’s utility to fulfill it.\nThus, **無** (*wú*) depends on **有** (*yǒu*) for utility,\nwhile **有** (*yǒu*) relies on **無** (*wú*) for function.\n**無** (*wú*) speaks of the Dao beyond form,\nwhile **有** (*yǒu*) speaks of shaped vessels.\nThe Dao is not revealed without vessels,\nand vessels are incomplete without the Dao.\nThe interdependence of Dao and vessels\ncannot be separated—one cannot be discarded for the other.\n\nAnother interpretation:\nBian Que said that within the human body are the five viscera,\nwhere true *qi* converges.\nEach viscera governs six *qi*,\nthus forming the thirtyfold convergence—\nlike the thirty spokes of a chariot.\nFlowing ceaselessly, they communicate through a single pivot,\njust as the thirty spokes unite at the **毂** (*gǔ*).\nThe sage understands the pivot of transformation,\nusing **有** (*yǒu*) as form and substance,\nthe body as the furnace,\nthe Three Palaces as the tripod,\ncrafting creation within the void of indistinctness.\nLike the chariot one rides,\nthe vessels one uses,\nthe dwelling one inhabits—\nthese exist as **有** (*yǒu*) in form,\nyet as **無** (*wú*) in function.\nThus, **有** (*yǒu*) is for utility,\nand **無** (*wú*) is for function.\nAs Wei Boyang’s *Parametric Concordance* states:\n*\"Use **無** (*wú*) to govern **有** (*yǒu*);*\n*the function of vessels lies in emptiness.\"*\nAll these interpretations hold merit;\nlet them remain for those who seek enlightenment.\n\nXu Liuyu said:\n*\"The thirty spokes converge at the **毂** (*gǔ*) for their function.\nThis passage speaks of the sage’s insight:\nthe thirty spokes unite at the **毂** (*gǔ*).\nObserving things to understand the body’s Dao—\nthis is not merely about words.\nThe principles of chariots, dwellings, and vessels\nhave been thoroughly discussed by the ancients.\nThis need not be repeated.\nYet the Dao of observing things to know the body\nis seldom spoken of.\nConsider this: the head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth,\nbody, hands, and feet—\nall compose the self,\neach with its own governance.\nThough they form a single mass,\nmovement, speech, and laughter all originate from within.\nYet when seeking the ‘self’ (*wú*),\nthere is no precise location to point to.\nIs it not the self without position,\nenabling the body’s numbered functions?\nThis is what the text means by:\n**‘有** (*yǒu*) **is for utility, 無** (*wú*) **is for function.’**\nReaders should ponder this deeply.\n\nChai Yuangao said:\n*\"The thirty spokes converge at the **毂** (*gǔ*).\nThe spokes are the wheel’s boards,\nthe **毂** (*gǔ*) is what pierces through them.\nThe **毂** (*gǔ*) is the body,\nthe spokes are the function.\nLike the heart governing all laws.\nWhen at **無** (*wú*), there is the chariot’s function.\nWhen there is no chariot,\nwho reveals the marvel of spokes and **毂** (*gǔ*)?\nWhen shaping clay into vessels,\nwho reveals the marvel of dug-out dwellings?\nThus, **有** (*yǒu*) is for utility,\nand **無** (*wú*) is for function.\nWhen **有** (*yǒu*) manifests, its benefits are clear;\nwhen **無** (*wú*) manifests, its marvels are revealed.\nThe heart as body, utility as function.\"\n\nSu Jingjing said:\n*\"From ‘the thirty spokes converge at the **毂** (*gǔ*)’ to ‘for their function,’\nthis passage embodies Laozi’s intent—\n**無** (*wú*) alone.\nThe **毂** (*gǔ*) is the chariot’s central axle,\nthe spokes are the wheel’s ribs.\nOnly because the **毂** (*gǔ*) is hollow within\ncan it contain the axle to push the wheel,\nthus yielding the chariot’s function.\n**埏埴** (*kēngzhí*) are the potter’s vessels—\nthe turning wheel.\nOnly because the wheel is hollow and round can it rotate,\nthus yielding the vessel’s function.\nPiercing doors as windows,\nthen the dwelling is illuminated.\nOnly because the windows are hollow\ndoes the dwelling’s function emerge.\nThe hollowness of the **毂** (*gǔ*), the wheel, and the windows—\nall are **無** (*wú*).\nThese three, though void in substance,\ngive rise to function.\nThus, the existence of chariots, vessels, and dwellings\nall arise from **無** (*wú*).\"*\n\n「This too carries the meaning of *things arising from the void*.\nMaster Ben-yī of the One Hut said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge to serve their function.*\nThings are *having* (*yǒu*).\nThat which enables their function is *void* (*wú*).\nTo wield *having* for the sake of *having* is merely to let things contend with things.\nThus, if *void* lacks *having*, it has no foundation;\nif *having* lacks *void*, it has no master.\nIt is not only chariots, dwellings, and vessels that follow this.\nSpeaking of the world, things are its boundaries, while the Dao is its mystery.\nSpeaking of a single person, the body is its substance, while the mind is its void.\nYet *void* profits *having*, and *having* serves *void*—\nthese two are never truly separate.\nThus, there are no things outside the Dao,\nnor a body outside the mind.\n\nThis is the *utilitarian* function of *void*,\nnot the *substantial* function of *void*.\nIf we speak in terms of substance and function,\nthen *void* is the substance, while *having* is the function.\n\nStone Pool [commentary] states:\n*\"Thirty spokes unite at one hub,\nyet it is their void that yields the chariot’s function.\nThe potter’s wheel shapes vessels,\nyet it is their void that yields the vessel’s function.\nPiercing doors as windows for a dwelling—\nyet it is their void that yields the dwelling’s function.\nThus, *having* brings profit,\nwhile *void* brings function.\n\nThe thirty spokes unite at one hub\nto form the chariot.\nYet the axle’s resting place must be hollow within,\nonly then can it move.\nIf the chariot were solid and not hollow,\nwhat use would the hub serve?\nThe potter’s wheel shapes vessels,\nyet the clay must be hollowed to form its handles and lids,\nonly then can the vessel be complete.\nIf the potter’s wheel did not rely on void for function,\nhow could the vessel ever be made?\nPiercing doors as windows for a dwelling—\nyet it must allow light and passage,\nonly then can one dwell and reside.\nIf it were not hollow and open,\nwhat use would the dwelling have?\nThus, *having* brings profit,\nwhile *void* brings function.\n\nThat which brings profit through *having* are chariots, vessels, and dwellings.\nThat which brings function through *void* all depend on emptiness.\nTo illustrate for humanity,\none must have a void mind to receive the Dao—\nthe Dao gathers in the void.\n\nSome say that vessels must be hollow to contain,\nand dwellings must be hollow to inhabit—\nyet this is the very *void* of the potter’s wheel, doors, and windows.\nOthers say that before these chariots, vessels, and dwellings existed,\ntheir functions already existed—\nyet this may not be Laozi’s intent.\n\n*Complete

      "translated_text": "**The Collected Meanings of the Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**\n\n**Title:** *The Collected Meanings of the Dao/Way and Virtue/Power*\n**Compiled by:** Yuan Dynasty Liu Weiyong\n**Volume:** Seventeen\n**Source of the base text:** *The Zhengheng Daoist Canon* (洞神部), *Jade Precepts Category* (玉诀类)\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: Master Ningyuan’s Dao/Way and Virtue/Power at Xuanmiao Guan on the Changde Path**\n**Compiled by:** Liu Weiyong, with guidance from Master Ningyuan\n**Corrected by:** Former imperial official Ding Yidong, who served as *Taifu Temple Clerk* (太府寺簿) and *Editor at the Secretariat* (枢密院编修)\n\n**The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power (Dao De Jing) – Critical Examination of Variations**\n**Note on textual differences:** *He Shang Gong’s* edition divides *The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* into two sections; this follows *Wang Fushi’s* edition instead.\n\n**The Sage of the Dao/Way says:**\nThe Dao/Way is the path all share in common;\nVirtue/Power is what the heart universally attains.\nThe Dao/Way endures through all ages without decay,\nVirtue/Power fills the nature and remains forever.\n\nAt the close of the Zhou Dynasty,\nthe Dao/Way descended while Virtue/Power waned,\nthus the sage composed ninety-nine chapters to elucidate the eternal principles of Dao/Way and Virtue/Power,\nand called it *The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Scripture*.\nIts words are concise, its meaning profound—\nscholars must discern and delve deeply into it.\n\n**Huang Maocai said:**\nThe Dao/Way is what all must pass through to be born;\nVirtue/Power is what all must attain to be nourished.\nThe heavens and earth use this to give birth and sustain all things,\nthus they are inexhaustible;\nThe perfected sage uses this to give birth and sustain the self,\nthus they do not die.\n\nThough the Dao/Way and Virtue/Power have two names,\nin truth they serve as one—\nthey cannot be separated.\nIn the present age, scholars divide the upper chapters as *The Dao/Way*\nand the lower chapters as *Virtue/Power*,\nwhich is far from the original intent of the work.\nIt would be better to call it *The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Scripture* in its entirety.\n\n**Shi Tan said:**\nThere are many interpretations of *The Laozi*,\nbut those by Confucian scholars—\nsuch as Cheng Tai’s and Lin Zhuhan’s—\noften explain the Dao/Way in terms of Confucian *dao*,\nas if it were the principle guiding daily conduct.\nThose by Buddhist scholars—\nsuch as Su Yingbin’s and Benlai Zi’s—\noften explain it in terms of Buddhist *xing* (性),\nas if it were the bare, naked nature of beings.\nNeither approach captures the original meaning,\nfor Confucian *dao* refers to the principle within ordinary affairs,\nwhile Laozi’s *dao* is the voidless, natural Way.\nHow can one forcefully align Laozi’s *dao* with Confucianism?\nBuddhist *xing* (性) refers to the pure emptiness untainted by form or *qi*,\nwhile Laozi’s *dao* encompasses the harmonious interplay of form and spirit.\nHow can one forcefully align Laozi’s *dao* with Buddhism?\n\nThough it is said that \"under heaven there is no second Dao/Way\"\nand \"the sage has no dual heart,\"\nyet the benevolent see it as benevolence,\nand the wise see it as wisdom—\ntheir distinctions must be clearly understood.\n\nConfucian scholars explain *dao* as the principle beyond form,\nyet they hold that it does not depart from the instruments of the lower realm.\nBuddhist scholars explain *xing* (性) as pure emptiness,\nyet they exclude form and *qi*.\nLaozi, however, seeks the marvelous unity of form and spirit,\nso that they may align with the true Dao/Way.\nThis is why their interpretations differ.\n\nIf each adheres strictly to their own teaching,\nnot only will they fail to grasp Laozi’s core intent,\nbut they will also lose sight of their own true teachings.\n\nAs for Daoist interpretations—\nsuch as those by Bai Yuxian—\nthey are indeed faithful to the original,\nbut they tend to favor lofty abstractions and oversimplification,\nmaking the text obscure and rendering it akin to Guo Xiang’s commentary on *The Zhuangzi*.\nThus, this present commentary\nadheres strictly to Laozi’s original teaching,\nso as not to stray from his true intent,\nyet it avoids the lofty obscurity of Bai Yuxian’s style.\n\nScholars should examine this carefully.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter: \"The Dao/Way That Can Be Spoken Of\"**\n**Note on textual differences:** *He Shang Gong* titled this chapter *\"The Chapter of Embodiment\"* (体道章),\nand Zhao Shixian titled it *\"The Chapter of Illuminating Principles and True Meanings\"* (显理会真义章).\nThis follows the *Ming Huang* (Tang Emperor) edition.\n\n**Tang Emperor’s commentary on this chapter:**\nAt the origin of all marvelous transformations and the source of ten thousand changes,\nthe chapter first marks the Dao/Way as *the void’s utmost* (虚极),\nto reveal where all marvels converge.\nThus, \"the Dao/Way that can be spoken of\" and \"the name that can be given\"\nclarify the substance and function of the Dao/Way;\n\"without name, yet with name\" reveals the essence and its traces;\n\"without desire, yet with desire\" distinguishes two perspectives;\n\"the same origin, yet different names\" shows how the undifferentiated gives rise to all things;\n\"the same name, yet called the mysterious\" shows how all things return to the undifferentiated.\n\"Mysterious again, mysterious again\" elucidates the interplay of unity and forgetfulness.\n\"The gateway of all marvels\" indicates the path by which one attains enlightenment and exits.\n\nThese are the stages of progress and refinement,\nthe gradual path to enlightenment and true understanding.\n\n**Du Guangting’s *Broad Commentary on the Daoist Canon* (广圣义) explaining the Emperor’s commentary:**\n*\"Ming\"* (明) means luminous and pure—\nto reveal openly.\n*\"Miao ben\"* (妙本) refers to the Dao/Way.\nAt the beginning of the Scripture,\nit clarifies the Dao/Way’s origin.\n*\"You\"* (由) means to follow;\n*\"Qi\"* (起) means to arise.\n*\"Wan\"* (万) signifies the vastness of numbers.\n*\"Hua\"* (化) means transformation and adaptation—\nit speaks of all things arising from the Dao/Way through transformation.\n*\"Zong\"* (宗) means master;\n*\"yuan\"* (源) means origin.\nSince all transformations arise from the Dao/Way,\nthen knowing the Dao/Way is the master and origin of all transformations.\n\nFrom this chapter, all principles emerge,\nlike the ceaseless flow of water from its source.\n*\"Xu ji\"* (虚极) is the Dao/Way’s marvelous origin,\nthe Dao/Way being its ultimate designation.\n\nThis chapter first marks the Dao/Way that can be spoken of as its substance,\nand the name that can be given as its function.\nThe final chapter returns to the gateway of all marvels,\nwhere all traces converge toward the Dao/Way’s origin,\nand once again directs us toward the Dao/Way’s true essence.\n\nWithin this gateway, seven distinctions are made:\n1. *\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of\"* and *\"the name that can be given\"* clarify its substance and function.\n2. *\"Substance and function\"* (体用) means mutual reliance.\n   Substance has no fixed form, function has no fixed application—\n   without function, substance cannot be displayed;\n   without substance, function cannot be established.\n   Sometimes there is substance, sometimes function;\n   sometimes both are real, sometimes provisional;\n   sometimes manifest, sometimes symbolic;\n   sometimes named, sometimes represented—\n   they mutually define each other,\n   alternating to reveal their nature.\n   Thus, substance and function are understood as interdependent clarifications.\n\n3. *\"Without name, yet with name\"* reveals the Dao/Way’s essence and its traces.\n   Essence and traces are mutually generative.\n   There is essence, then traces arise;\n   traces lead us to the essence.\n   Without essence, traces cannot appear;\n   without traces, essence cannot be sought—\n   traces emerge with each event,\n   serving as the essence’s manifestation.",

is called the **Gate of All Mysteries**.\n\nEmperor Tang Minghuang said:\n*The Dao that can be spoken reaches the point of no name.*\n\nThe **Dao** is the **uttermost subtlety in action**;\nThe

origin** at its beginning,\nBefore the **Nameless** descends as *qi*,\nOpens and establishes Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth mutually support each other as their origin—\nThus, it is called the **Nameless**, the origin of Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the *Taiji* generating the *Two Principles* in the *Yijing*.\n\n*Powering and supporting* (权舆) means *beginning* (as in the *Er Ya*).\nThe

      "translated_text": "The observer, externally surveys with the eyes,\nInternally illuminates with the spirit—\nThe eyes discern the presence and absence,\nThe spirit resonates with the silent void.\n\nHumans are born in stillness—\nThis is the nature of Heaven, as spoken in *The Record of Music*.\nIt speaks of nature being inherently pure and tranquil,\nWithout desire or striving.\nWhen moved by things, stirred by circumstances,\nSensations arise from without and stir within—\nHow can one be cautious of what one is moved by?\n\nThus, the Sage establishes laws to curb their wickedness,\nInstitutes rites to curb their chaos,\nEnacts punishments to curb their excesses,\nCreates music to curb their licentiousness.\nBy the Dao restraining desire,\nThis is how the people are taught to revere virtue and pursue goodness.\n\nThese two [paths] arise from the same source but differ in name.\n\nFrom the One Qi, myriad transformations arise;\nFrom the emergence of forms, myriad things manifest.\nThe three transformations vary, yet twofold—\nFrom non-being, being emerges—\nThis is what is meant.\n\nWhen the Dao is manifest, names are established;\nWhen names are established, desire arises—\nThis is where the Dao can be spoken of,\nWhere names can be named,\nWhere the mechanism of desire is ignited.\nThis is how traces arise from their roots.\n\nTo **shelter the traces** is to abandon desire, forget names,\nAnd return to the wondrous root of the Dao—\nTo forget the Dao in names,\nTo forget names is to return to the root.\n\nThose who follow their emotions chase desire and forget the root,\nDescending into slipperiness—\nOnly those who return to the origin of things\nCan speak of the utmost Dao.\n\nBoth are called **mysterious**.\n\nThose with desire and those without desire\nReceive qi from Heaven and Earth.\nIf they receive the balanced, harmonious essence,\nThey become virtuous and sage, acting without doing.\nIf they receive turbid, chaotic qi,\nThey become dull and foolish, with many desires.\n\nIf one can purify the heart, transform thoughts,\nClarify desire and contain emptiness,\nThen they are those who shelter the traces and return to the root.\n\nWhen all cultivate and refine themselves,\nAnd customs return to simplicity and harmony,\nThe wind of returning to simplicity\nCan reach the ancient past.\n\nMysterious beyond mysterious—\nThe gateway to all wonders.\n\nTo shelter the traces and forget names\nAlready grasps its wonder—\nYet fearing stagnation in wonder,\nOne forgets it again—\nThus, both root and trace are forgotten.\nAgain forgetting this intention,\nThe spirit merges with the Dao.\n\nHaving dispelled desire,\nEven non-desire is forgotten—\nNot clinging to being or non-being,\nNot fixating on the middle path—\nThis is the complete forgetting.\n\nThe gateway to all wonders is the Heavenly Gate.\nThe Heavenly Gate is the total name for the origin of all dharma.\nWithout being—\nIt speaks of all things emerging from non-being,\nReturning to non-being—\nGathering and dispersing, concealing and revealing—\nThus, they are transient guests of coming and going.\n\nEmpty in name, yet no true gate exists—\nThus, it is called the gate of non-doing.\n\nThen, there is no gate—\nNo gate means no sides—\nFour-way openness, vast and boundless—\nThis is returning to the wondrous Dao.\n\n**True observation** is the gradual path of cultivation,\nThe stages of verifying the Dao.\n\nThe earlier \"seen with the eyes\" is the observation of surveying.\nThe \"illuminated by the spirit\" is the observation of practice.\n\nThe Dao also employs the Three Vehicles’ methods to transform people,\nFrom initial awakening to ultimate attainment—\nAbandoning the mundane to realize the sacred—\nThus, there are fourteen stages of observation and practice.\n\nThe Small Vehicle’s initial gate has three observations:\nFirst, the **observation of provisional dharma**—oppositional discernment.\nSecond, the **observation of true dharma**—illumination of the mind.\nThird, the **observation of pervasive emptiness**—entering non-doing.\n\nThe Middle Vehicle’s gate of observation and practice has four:\nFirst, the observation of **impermanence**,\nSecond, the observation of **eternity**,\nThird, the observation of **non-impermanence**,\nFourth, the observation of **non-eternity**.\n\nThe Great Vehicle’s gate of observation and practice also has four:\nFirst, the **observation of wondrous being**,\nSecond, the **observation of wondrous non-being**,\nThird, the **observation of profound mystery**,\nFourth, the **observation of non-profound mystery**.\n\nThe Sacred Practice gate further has three observations:\nFirst, the **observation of true emptiness**,\nSecond, the **observation of true penetration**,\nThird, the **observation of true non-being**.\n\nThrough these observations and practices,\nOne refines the mind—\nFrom being to non-being,\nFrom coarse to wondrous—\nAttaining wonder and forgetting it,\nThus resonating with the gate of non-doing.\n\nNon-doing and doing—\nThe Dao can be spoken of as constant Dao,\nBody and function held together—\nIts principle is clear.\n\nNow, within the gate of body and function,\nIt is divided into five distinctions:\nFirst, **non-doing as body, doing as function**—\nThe Dao as body is without,\nNames as function are with.\nSecond, **doing as body, non-doing as function**—\nHouses, carriages, tools—\nTheir doing is body,\nTheir non-doing is function—\nUtilizing their non-being.\nThird, **non-doing as body, non-doing as function**—\nNaturalness as body,\nConditional relations as function—\nAll are non-being.\nFourth, **doing as body, doing as function**—\nHeaven and Earth as body,\nAll things as function—\nAll are being.\nFifth, **neither being nor non-being as body,\nNeither being nor non-being as function**—\nThe Dao as body,\nVirtue/power as function.\n\nAgain, within the gate of root and trace,\nIt is divided into two distinctions:\n**Non-being as root, being as trace**—\nNon-naming and naming.\n**Being as root, non-being as trace**—\nMutual illumination.\n\nAll things originate from being yet ultimately return to non-being.\n\nFrom the mysterious source, pure and silent,\nThe wondrous root, distant and obscure—\nNot sought through words or symbols,\nNot verified through being or non-being—\nIndeed, debate on principles is exhausted,\nSpeculation on the Dao is at its end—\nYet teachings are set forth to guide the mundane,\nDemonstrating these stages.\nYet it lies in the silent heart’s resonance,\nGradual or sudden, adapting to each case—\nDo not cling to teachings or fixate on words,\nBe not bound by scholarly conventions.\nThose who bathe their hearts in virtue and power,\nStrive diligently.\n\nThe Lord of the Dao says:\n*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao.*\n\nWithout beginning, it is called the Dao—\nUnspeakable, yet to speak of it is false.\nAgain it says:\n*The Dao should not be named,*\n*Yet the speakable and nameable Dao*\n*Is like things, like the four seasons—*\n*Appropriate when it should be.*\n\nRising and declining in succession,\nThis is not true constancy.\nConstant Dao, constant name—\nFrom its own root, its own foundation—\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed,\nIt has eternally endured.\n\nFu Xi obtained it to inherit the **Qi of the Mother**,\nThe Western Queen Mother attained it and sat in **Minor Broadness**—\nNo one knows its beginning,\nNo one knows its end.",

to perceive its subtlety;\nabiding in being suffices to know its manifestations.\nYet ultimately, it transcends the names of being and non-being.\n\nThe highest insight knows the origin of Heaven and Earth,\nwhile the lowest suffices to govern the order of all things—\nall through this.\n\n*The Zishuo* [Explanation of Characters] says:\n*\"Covered and entering—this is *xuan* [profound].*\nThus, *xuan* is composed of *xu* [cover] and *ru* [enter].\nThese two are called *xuan* together.\nThese two refer to being and non-being.\n\n*Xuan* is also black, yet bears a red hue.\nThe north is black as yin, yet *xuan* is yang.\nThus, the *I Ching* says:\n*'Kun on Earth is black.'*\nAnd again:\n*'Heaven is *xuan*, Earth is yellow.'*\nShun spoke of *xuan de* [profound virtue],\nreferring to its depth in the sage below.\n\nSu Yingbin said:\n*'The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\nYet all that can be spoken of is not the Dao—\nonly what cannot be spoken of can be constant.*\nNow, *ren* [benevolence], *yi* [righteousness], *li* [rites], and *zhi* [wisdom]\nare the Dao that can be spoken of.\nYet benevolence cannot be made righteousness,\nnor rites made wisdom.\nWhat can be spoken of cannot be constant in this way.\nOnly what cannot be spoken of\nallows *ren* to remain *ren*,\n*yi* to remain *yi*,\n*li* to remain *li*,\nand *zhi* to remain *zhi*—\nthough all these are not constant,\nthe Dao remains unchanging and unalterable.\nWhat cannot be spoken of alone can be constant in this way.\n\nWhat can be named is not the constant name.\nThe Dao cannot be spoken of—\nhow much less can it be named?\nAll names are of what can be spoken of.\nOnce names are established,\nthe distinctions of round and square, curved and straight\ncannot remain constant.\n\nNon-being names the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nuntil one observes its *jiao* [manifestations].\nFrom its nameless form, Heaven and Earth arise,\nand once positioned, names begin to establish themselves.\nFrom its named propagation, ten thousand things emerge,\nand as they flourish, names become innumerable.\nThus, the nameless is the essence of the Dao,\nwhile the named is its function.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao for the world’s use,\nentering all things while remaining constantly non-being,\nto observe its subtlety;\nembodying the utmost non-being while remaining constantly being,\nto observe its manifestations.\nIf one acts only in its manifestations without knowing its subtlety,\nit is coarse and not divine.\nIf one lingers only in its subtlety without knowing its manifestations,\nit is refined yet not comprehensive.\n\nThese two, when brought to their utmost, are called *xuan*.\nSpeaking in terms of form,\nbeing and non-being are indeed two—\nhow can one know that non-being transforms into being,\nand being returns to non-being,\nyet they are never separate?\nThough their names differ,\ntheir origin is one.\nKnowing their origin as one,\nthis is *xuan*.\n\nAll that is distant without limit\nmust be of a *xuan* hue,\nthus Laozi often used *xuan* to convey the extreme.\n*Xuan* beyond *xuan*—\nthe gateway to all subtleties.\nSpeaking of *xuan* is to reach it,\nyet still the mind of *xuan* remains.\n*Xuan* beyond *xuan* is exhausted—\nnothing more can be added—\nthe source from which all subtleties emerge.\n\nLü Jifu said:\n*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.*\nAll the Dao under Heaven that can be spoken of\nis not the Dao—\nyet at times it is perilous, hence not the constant Dao.\nAll names under Heaven that can be named\nare not the constant name—\nten thousand things, each returning to their root,\nreturning to the root is called *jing* [stillness],\nstillness is called *fu ming* [restoring life],\nrestoring life is called *chang* [constant].\nWhen the Dao reaches constancy,\nthe mind solidifies, the form relaxes,\nand self and objects are forgotten.\nWho can know the Dao that can be spoken of,\nor the names that can be named?\n\nThus, the constant Dao is indeed unspeakable.\nHence it is said: *The Dao endures long, yet does not perish with life.*\nThe constant name is indeed unnameable.\nHence it is said: *From ancient times to today, its name does not fade.*\n\nNot perishing, not fading—\nthis is called the constant Dao.\nNon-being is the Mother of ten thousand things.\nConstant non-being is the Dao itself,\nand the origin from which Heaven and Earth begin,\nhence it is said: *Non-being names the beginning of Heaven and Earth.*\n\nAt the *Tai Chu* [Great Origin], there was being and non-being,\nyet non-being had no name.\nBeing and non-being—\neven one cannot be named with being and non-being,\nfor the origin of one, though not yet formed, already exists.\nOnce called *one*,\nthough not yet formed, it already has a name.\nThe name *one* is one,\nyet the one who names is two—\ntwo and one make three,\nand from here ten thousand things arise in confusion.\nThus it is said: *The named is the Mother of ten thousand things.*\n\nConstant non-being reaches the observation of its manifestations.\nKnowing constancy is called *ming* [clarity],\nand clarity sees all things.\nThus, only constancy can be observed—\nwhen desireless, it purifies and gazes profoundly,\nwith no flaw in observing its subtlety,\nhence it is said: *Constant non-desire can be named as small.*\nWhen desire arises,\nten thousand things act together,\nand all things return to it,\nyet the master remains unknown—\nthis can be named as great.",

      "original_text": "刘仲平曰：道可道至之母。 太极之所待者，道也。 天地之所待者，万物也。 万物之所待者，天地也。 夫有所待者非所谓道，乃道之积也。 至无而无名者，道也。 离无而无名者，太极也。 入有而有名者，天地也。 太极冥乎神，而名不可得而识者也，乃道之妙也。 天地着乎象，而名可以载者也，乃道之徼也。 二者皆出乎言也，常无欲者之所观，见乎妙而已矣。 常有欲者之所观，见乎徼而已矣。 惟无欲者之所观，可以通於玄也。 或曰：非此之谓也。 谓无者所以名天地之始，而有者名万物之母也，谓常无者，欲以观其妙，而常有者，欲以观其徼也。 曰：非也。 读之者误也。 谓有者可以名万物之母，而谓无者岂可名天地之始乎？ 谓常有者可以观其徼，而谓常无者岂特观其妙而已乎？ 夫有始则有终，而不可命之无； 常无则至无，而不可命之有。 噫，知此则其知玄矣。 常无欲以至之门。 常无常有，言有无相用，不可偏而不举也。 常无者欲以观其道之妙，常有者欲以观其道之徼。 妙言本，徼言末，末与本俱能观之，然后见其道矣。 常名以无方为体，常道以无体为用，无方者无乎不在，无体者无乎不为。 无乎不为有所可道，则非所谓无方； 有所可名则非所谓无体，故曰道可道非常道，名可名非常名。 太初有无，无有无名，无有无名者，太始也。 太始者，天地之父，故曰无名，天地之始。 天地者，万物之母，故曰有名，万物之母。 言母则知始之为父，言始则知母之为生，故上言天地之始，而下言万物之母。 然天下之理，有道有常道，有名有常名。 所谓太初有无者，无而已矣。 所谓无有无名者，名而已矣。 盖有无则有名之名矣，故无名者，天地之始而已。 而其上又有祖也。 妙者，道之本； 徼者，道之末。 圣人之妙也，观之以常无。 圣人之徼也，观之以常有。 故曰常无欲以观其妙，常有欲以观其徼。 妙在中，粗在徼。 言妙则知徼之为粗，言徼则知妙之为中。 故上言欲以观其妙，下言欲以观其徼。 盖夫无者对有之无，而常无者非无之无，而不为有对也。 有者对无之有，而常有者非有之有，而不为无对也。 不为无对者非有也，不为有对者非无也。 故常有者，真无是已而非无。 常有者，妙有是已而非有。 故此两者同出而同归之玄也。 庄子曰：建之以常无有，言之以太一。 盖周读为常无、常有。 常无也欲以观其妙，常有也欲以观其徼。 为其欲以观其妙也，故建以常无。 为其欲以观其徼也，故建以常有。 若夫徼妙俱忘，而无欲观之，则所谓建之以常无有者，冥之而已矣。 夫是之谓又玄，而非特同谓之玄。 玄之又玄，众妙之门。 玄者妙之体，妙者玄之用。 妙者同出乎非玄也。 刘巨济曰：道可道，非常道。 道接於言，则其为道也可而已，非常道也。 常道无可，所谓常无欲是也。 道无不可，所谓常有欲是也。 世道交丧，而老子治一救之，则其适物为可，不主故常，以通天下之变而已。 名可名，非常名，强名之曰大，则此名者大是也。 大，名也，道，字也。 常名无可，无可则无名； 可名无不可，无不可则有名。 名字之玄，其在兹乎？ 无名至之母。 此特言名而不言道也。 以名及字，故见无名亦可也。 天地之始，廓然冥同，则所谓名字者果安在乎？",

Spoken of**\nZhao Shizhan says:\n\n1. **Transcending Form to Manifest the True**\n   The Dao that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao.\n   The Dao that can be spoken of is the realm of *form and lower things*.\n   The Eternal Dao is the realm of *formless and higher things*.\n\n   In the realm of *form and lower things*, the Dao is dispersed among shapes, names, measures, and calculations.\n   In the realm of *formless and higher things*, the Dao is concealed in the void, emptiness, stillness, and boundlessness.\n\n   If one seeks the Dao through objects, the Dao cannot be grasped—\n   for its inability to be grasped, forms and instruments are not the Dao.\n   If one observes the Dao apart from objects, the Dao has no fixed attributes—\n   for its lack of fixed attributes, its divine mysteries are boundless.\n\n   The heart is the substance of the Dao;\n   the Dao and the heart are not distinct.\n   Nature is the origin of the heart;\n   the heart and nature are not different.\n   The heart and nature—\n   the formless in form.\n   The Dao and the heart—\n   the formless yet manifest.\n\n   The heart, nature, and Dao—\n   though spoken as three, they are one.\n   Being, non-being, and unity—\n   though divided into three, they converge as one.\n\n   One is said to be *numbers*—\n   yet the Dao is not *numbers*!\n   One is said to be *mystery*—\n   yet the Dao is not separate from *numbers*!\n   Mystery is formless—\n   yet the Dao cannot be confined by words!\n\n   Its manifestation is clarity;\n   all things are without exception in the Dao.\n   Thus, even the Dao that can be spoken of,\n   though it may be spoken of, still holds the Eternal Dao within it.\n   The Eternal Dao, though it transcends what can be spoken of,\n   yet the Dao that can be spoken of is rooted in it.\n\n   If one distinguishes between true and false in form,\n   the true is the Eternal Dao,\n   while the false is the Dao that can be spoken of.\n   If one distinguishes between emptiness and reality,\n   the Dao is the substance of true nature,\n   while things are illusory manifestations.\n\n   Let us illustrate with practical principles,\n   perhaps this will yield some understanding.\n\n   Though called *eternal*, change is inherent.\n   Thus, when we speak of *eternal*,\n   it refers to the realm of nature,\n   the heart to the function of the Dao—\n   together, they are called *eternal*.\n   The substance of *eternal* is taken from its unchanging aspect;\n   for its unchanging aspect, it is called *eternal*.\n   From the Eternal Dao flow all things.\n\n   Again, *eternal* is great—\n   thus, when viewed from this perspective, is it not great?\n   *Eternal* is the radiant function of the Sage.\n   To speak of *eternal* is not to exclude the Dao;\n   to speak of the Dao is not to exclude *eternal*—\n   what is called *eternal* is the Dao,\n   and the Dao is *eternal*.\n   If one must speak of the Dao without mentioning *eternal*,\n   how can the Eternal Dao be fixed as one?\n   If one must speak of *eternal* without mentioning the Dao,\n   how can the Dao be displayed in its fullness?\n\n   *Eternal* abides eternally;\n   the eternal abides in unchanging constancy.\n   *Communicating* flows through all things;\n   the communicating flows without end.\n\n   One substance, two functions—\n   yet one substance encompasses both change and constancy.\n   Heaven is not eternal?\n   The Nine Heavens reach their limit, yet Heaven sometimes alters.\n   Earth is not eternal?\n   The Six Directions reach their limit, yet Earth sometimes emerges.\n   The sun is not eternal?\n   It sometimes wanes.\n   The moon is not eternal?\n   It sometimes eclipses.\n\n   The *Qian* (Heaven) above the Nine Heavens has no head,\n   the *Peng* (Great Bird) rests only at the Sixth Month—\n   thus, those who cling to form and *numbers* must have limits.\n   Only the *eternal* has no form,\n   no form means no *numbers*,\n   no *numbers* means no generation,\n   no generation means no annihilation.\n\n   From Heaven and Earth down to all things,\n   they are all of *form and numbers*—\n   how could they be the same as my True Eternal Dao?\n\n   Thus, it is said:\n   The Dao that can be spoken of is not my Eternal Dao.\n\n   Is *eternal* not change?\n   To call it *eternal* without change—is that possible?\n   Is change not *eternal*?\n   To call it change without constancy—is that possible?\n\n   When things are born,\n   *eternal* is with them in their birth.\n   When things transform,\n   *eternal* is with them in their transformation.\n   Born yet not born,\n   *eternal* flows without obstruction.\n   Transformed yet not transformed,\n   *eternal* remains as it is.\n\n   Self-born, self-transformed—\n   without the True Eternal Dao, how could birth and transformation occur?\n   Eternally born, eternally transformed—\n   this is the True Eternal Dao, which ceaselessly generates and transforms.\n\n   Flowing, dispersing, shifting—\n   it does not cling to any fixed *eternal* state.\n   Waning and waxing, full and empty—\n   it does not adhere to any fixed principle,\n   yet it encompasses all forms without being seen,\n   abides in one nature eternally.\n   Exhausted, it transforms;\n   transformed, it flows.\n   The great person adapts to the times through this.\n\n   If useful, then follow;\n   if not, then abandon—\n   the Sage knows transformation through this.\n\n   When applied to the world,\n   it is called the *divine instrument*.\n   When practiced for the benefit of all things,\n   it is called *enlightened authority*.\n   When pondered to its utmost elemental principle,\n   it is called *subtle mystery*.\n   When wielded in accordance with yin-yang,\n   it is called *divine mechanism*.\n\n   As for Yao’s use of it—*benevolence*;\n   Shun’s use of it—*filial piety*;\n   Yu’s use of it—*channeling the rivers and streams*;\n   Tang’s use of it—*ascending to sage-like reverence*.\n   Though their uses differ,\n   their essence is one.\n\n   Only those virtuous rulers who do not share the Sage’s concerns\n   can truly embody the *eternal*—\n   for they alone understand its substance.\n\n2. **Transcending Names to Manifest Reality**\n   Names can be named,\n   yet they are not the Eternal Names.\n   What can be named with names\n   still has form.\n   The Dao being formless,\n   how could it be named?\n\n   The *Classic* says: *Not the Eternal Name*.\n   What can be named is not my Eternal Name—\n   yet the Eternal also has a name.\n\n   The Eternal is without generation;\n   generation is matter—\n   all matter can be named.\n   The Eternal is without use;\n   use is action—\n   all actions can be named.\n   Yet to investigate the origin of generation,\n   the ancestor of all actions,\n   one finds it cannot be seen.\n\n   Liezi says:\n   *\"When the Dao is fully applied, it fills the six voids;\n   when it is discarded, no one knows its whereabouts.\"*\n\n   The Dao has unity and dispersion,\n   nature has interaction and distinction—\n   the formless unites with the formless,\n   the formless enters the formless without obstruction.\n   Its spirit soars like lightning,\n   its motion is swift as a drawn arrow—\n   how could one trace its path?\n\n   This is the Dao that cannot be named.\n   Thus, unity is oneness of substance.\n   This unity is unity with the Great Void.\n\n   Dispersion is the origin of all things;\n   from the formless arises the form.\n   The ungenerated can generate all things—\n   vital

      "translated_text": "The **Dao/Way** (*Zhuāngzǐ*) speaks of the **Mystery of Mysteries** (*Xuánxuán*): since all things arise from the void and none (*Xūwú*), yet take form in the manifest (*yǒuxiàng*), the **Mystery** (*Lǐ*) is thus established, and the **Sage** (*Shèngrén*) perceives it, abiding in perception and awareness (*cúnxū jiànjiàn*). The **Dao/Way** is without color and form (*wú sèxiàng*), true beyond names and words (*zhēn jué míngyán*), its essence exhausted in the heartless (*wúxīn*), its destination fulfilled in the real (*shíqù*). Since the void and none is the **Dao/Way**, why cling to things’ forms and appearances (*xiàngyīn*)? To not abandon perception and hearing (*bù jué jiànwén*), how could one return to purity and stillness (*Qīngjìng*)?\n\nPurity and stillness (*Qīngjìng*) are the root of nature (*xìng*), color and form (*sèxiàng*) the cause of names (*míng*). Nature’s root is serene and pure (*zhànrán*), neither name nor form. When form arises without nature—this is delusion, this is emptiness (*wàngwú*). Thus names arise from the body and form, forms from the mind’s perception (*niànxīn*), truth and falsehood stand opposed—yet the **Dao/Way**’s origin remains unfathomable (*nán yuán*).\n\n---\n\n**Thus**, the one who composes the **Scriptures** (*Jīng*) must uphold the void and none (*Xūwú*), while the seeker of **Mystery** (*Lǐ*) must observe color and form (*sèxiàng*). Through the void, one perceives reality (*jiàn shí*), from delusion and illusion (*huànwàng*), one knows the return (*zhī guī*). From none (*wú*) comes the having (*yǒu*), refined thought coalescing with dust to achieve completion (*jīng xiǎng chén ér chéngjiù*). Things lack inherent nature (*wú zìxìng*), hence the saying of the void (*yú wú yǒu yán*). The **Dao/Way** is nameless (*wú míng*), for it is not color. This is **Zhuāngzi**’s teaching: **\"Before the having (*yǒu*), there was the none (*wú*), and before the none, there was the none\"** (*Wèi shǐ yǒu fū, wèi shǐ yǒu wú yě zhě*).\n\n**Second**, the **Way**’s constant and transformative application (*Cháng*). The **Sage** seeks its subtle essence (*miào*) through desireless observation (*wúyù guān qù*). The **Dao/Way** itself does not generate, nor is its none (*wú*) not the **Dao/Way**. The **Dao/Way** descends into things (*wù*), yet things are never not true (*wù wú fēi zhēn*). When things return to the **Dao/Way**, the **Dao/Way** does not claim dominion over them. The **Dao/Way**’s true constancy (*Zhēncháng*) is effortlessly free (*tuōrán wú lèi*), yet how can one speak of the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) as a mere sweeping vision (*fànjǐng*), a single *qi* spontaneously arising (*yī qì zì shēng*)?\n\nThe **Mystery** (*Xuán*) coalesces with true essence (*Zhēn*), and the **Three Powers** (*Sāncái*—Heaven, Earth, and Man) manifest their concrete forms and symbols (*xìngxiàng*) in Heaven. Then the **Six Qi** (*Liùqì*—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Void) circulate and gather to form shapes (*huí bóbó chéngxíng*) upon Earth. The **Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) generate and transform, while **Yin** and **Yang** govern their grand cycles (*Yīnyáng zǒng qí dàshù*). The **Eight Trigrams** (*Bāguà*) are fixed by the **Four Seasons** (*Sìshí*), with standards both constant (*yǒucháng*) and ever-changing (*biànhuà bùyǐ*), in life and death (*yī shēng yī miè*), as the **Mystery** (*Lǐ*) of things inherently is (*zài wù lǐ zhī gùrán*).\n\nThe **Dao/Way**’s **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is undying and unborn (*bùsǐ bùshēng*), its governance refined through **Yin** and **Yang** (*yīnyáng zhī zhèngmiào*). Those who grasp this **Dao/Way** belong to the **Perfect Ones** (*Zhìrén*). To fail in understanding the origin of life (*wèi dá shēngyuán*), yet to cling to illusion and extinction (*tú guī huànmiè*), is to not exhaust the **Mystery** (*Bù qióng zàohuà*)—this is the **Way**’s direct pointing to **Rest** (*Xiū*) and **Floating** (*Fú*), unaware of the **Mystery** (*Shù*) in death. When things lose their **Spirit** (*Shén*), their forms are not burdened by the **Mystery** (*Shù*). Those who exhaust the **Mystery** (*Shù*) recognize that **Void** (*Kōng*) is not truly void, nor **Form** (*Sè*) truly form. This is the work of the **Inverted Observer** (*Nì guān zhě*).\n\n**Void** (*Xuán*) is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*). Earlier, it was said that having and none arise from the same **Mystery** (*Tǐ*), so one cannot distinguish them as having and none (*bù dé yǐ yǒu wú ér shū guān*). Later, the teaching is strictly sealed, hence the saying: **\"Void is the **Mystery**\"** (*Tóng wèi zhī xuán*). The character *tóng* (同) is composed of *yī* (一, \"one\") and *kǒu* (口, \"mouth\"), yet both are one in right and wrong (*yī zhě shìfēi, yī zhě shìfēi*). Thus, if they do not share the same *kǒu*, then right and wrong are the same. Hence, the **Great Unity** (*Dàtóng*) transcends humanity (*lí rén*).\n\nTo transcend humanity is to enter Heaven (*rù tiān*), and to enter Heaven is to align with the **Dao/Way** (*tóng dào*), which is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*). This is the **Great Unity** (*Dàtóng*). The **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of having and none (*Yǒu wú èr lǐ*) is the same, yet the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is spoken of as void (*wú*), making it subtle yet unseen (*miào ér bù kě jiàn*). Thus, the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is also seen through having (*yǒu*), how could it be said that the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is not the same? All things arise from having within none (*wú zhōng chū yǒu*), and none is contained within having (*yǒu zhōng hán wú*), rooted in the same nature (*bēn yī xìng*). Why then distinguish them as different?",

      "translated_text": "「Yet the nature of the **Great Unity** (*Dàtóng*) is first revealed through the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of transcending form and emptiness (*bèi sèkōng*), and further through the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of surpassing having and none (*lí yǒuwú*). Thus, its meaning becomes gradually clear.\n\nTo awaken is to perceive the **Dao/Way** in every aspect (*tóutóu shì dào*), while to be deluded is to see distinctions in all phenomena (*mí shì jiànjiàn jiē shū*). To regard death and life as one thread (*yī tiáo*), and to treat the acceptable and unacceptable as a single passage (*yī guàn*), only then can one attain **equality and wisdom** (*píngděng xìngzhì*) to enter it.\n\n**Yuè Jiě** says: *\"Subtle yet minute is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\"*\nThe **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is the essence of Heaven (*tiān zhī sè*).\nThe *Book of Meaning* (*Shūyì*) states: *\"Subtle yet minute is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), vast yet responsive is called **exalted** (*jùn*).\"*\nWhen **virtue/power** (*dé*) is concealed, it is subtle yet minute—this is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\nWhen **virtue/power** (*dé*) is manifested, it becomes vast yet responsive—this is **exalted** (*jùn*).\nThus, among the **Sages** (*shèngrén*), when **virtue/power** (*dé*) is in the lower realm, it is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), and when in the higher realm, it is called **exalted** (*jùn*).\n*\"Subtle yet minute\"* is indeed the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), yet it is difficult to speak of.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** has no form or appearance (*wú xíngxiàng*), so who can distinguish its vastness and minuteness?\nThe **Dao/Way** is vast as Heaven is vast (*dào dà tiān dà*), how could it be said to be minute?\nIn its relation to things (*qí zài wù*), how can minuteness be divided?\nIt is called *\"hidden\"* (*yǐn*) because it lacks form (*wú xíng*).\nIt is called *\"profound\"* (*ào*) because it is unfathomable (*wú cè*).\nIndeed, the **Sage’s** heart (*shèngrén zhī xīn*), in harmony with the **Dao/Way**, is subtle.\nWhen it emerges to respond to things (*chū ér yìng wù*), in principle it is hidden (*zài lǐ yǐn*), in practice it is manifest (*zài shì xiǎn*).\nThough the practice is minute, it reveals itself as vast—this is the **Dao/Way** entering the ears and eyes of mortals (*zhù rén zhī ěrmù*).\nThe **Dao/Way** is vast yet dwells in minuteness—this is the profound depths of the heart’s abode (*chǔ xīn zhī yuānměi*).\nMinuteness is the right (*yòu*), the right is the **yin** (*yīn*).\nThrough its hidden nature, the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is subtle yet does not conceal its application (*ér bù cáng yòng*).\nVastness is the left (*zuǒ*), the left is the **prince** (*jūn*).\nThrough its manifest nature, it reveals the practice yet does not display the principle (*ér bù xiǎn lǐ*).\nThus it is said: *\"Subtle yet minute is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\"*\n\nFive praises of the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\nFirst, all **dharma** (*zhūfǎ*) possess subtle essence.\nThe **Mystery** (*Xuán*) scripture observes its subtlety through constant non-desire (*wú yù*), and its profundity through constant desire (*yǒu yù*).\nAgain, the same origin yet different names is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\nThis binds the meaning of the first two sentences, unifying having and none into one principle (*yī zhèng*).\nIt is also said: *\"The **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\"*\nInitially, it refers to direct perception of the **Dao/Way**’s illumination (*jiànjué xiàngzhào*), awakening to this having and none (*wù yǒuwú*), where the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is unified in essence (*yīn shì yǒuwú*), and thus deep insight is attained (*shēn shí zhī*).\nYet the meaning of *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* transcends the former principle (*yòu fēi qián lǐ kě bì*).\nThe scripture’s intent proceeds step by step (*cìdì shì yǒuwú*).\nHaving and none arise from the **Dao/Way** (*yǒuwú shēng yú dào*), and the **Dao/Way** governs having and none (*dào suǒyǐ sī yǒuwú*).\nYet having is inherently having (*yǒu zì yǒu*), not the **Dao/Way**’s having (*fēi dào zhī yǒu*).\nNone is inherently none (*wú zì wú*), not the **Dao/Way**’s none (*fēi dào zhī wú*).\nThis is the **Dao/Way**’s sovereign yet non-sovereign nature (*zhī dào zhǔ zhī ér bù zhǔ*).\nYet none also emerges from the **Dao/Way** (*rán wú yì chū yú dào*), and having also emerges from the **Dao/Way** (*yǒu yì chū yú dào*).\nSince none’s essence is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), having’s essence cannot but also be the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\nNone manifests as images and patterns (*xiàngshù*), and images and patterns return to annihilation and none (*xiàngshù rù wú*).\nThe *Listed Master* (*Lièzǐ*) says: *\"Self-generated, self-transformed\"* is this.\nThus, having and none are not entangled with the **Dao/Way** (*yǒuwú bù gān yú dào*), and it is clear.\nYet having and none both emerge from the **Dao/Way** (*yǒuwú jiē zì dào chū*), and thus each attains the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\nIt is like one father with two sons—father and sons share the same surname (*xìng*).\nHow could the father’s surname be given to the elder son yet not to the younger?\nThis illustrates the **Dao/Way**’s **Mystery** (*Xuán*), and having and none cannot but share the same **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\n\nWhen applied in humanity (*qí yòng zài rén*), the **Dao/Way** generates from **Oneness** (*yī*).\n**Oneness** is number (*shù*), the beginning (*shǐ*), and the meaning of *\"embracing the beginning as one\"* (*bàoshǐ yī*) returns to the **Great None** (*Tàiwú*).\nThen, the body’s use and practice (*shēnzhōng yòngshì*) are revealed.\nHow could it be merely carried by empty words (*qǐ zhí yǐ xūyán zàizhī*)?\nWhen the **Dragon** (*lóng*) and **Tiger** (*hǔ*) intermingle, the **Sage’s embryo** (*shèngtāi*) is formed.\nThe **Sage’s embryo** is refined and reveals the **True Person** (*zhēnrén*).\nThe **True Person** emerges and rides upon the **Divine Light** (*shén guāng*).\n**Zhuangzi** says: *\"Ascending upon the **Divine Light** (*shén guāng*) with form’s annihilation.\"*\n\nSecond, the subtlety precedes all **dharma** (*zhūfǎ*).\nAgain, the **Mystery** (*Xuán*): all **dharma** arise from the **Dao/Way** (*cóng dào ér shēng*).\nThe coarse and refined—each possesses the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)’s principle (*yīyī jiē yǒu Xuánlǐ*), called *\"the essence of the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* (*tǐ Xuán*).\nThe **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of essence has not yet escaped traces (*wú tuō yú jì*).\nTo transcend the essence’s **Mystery** (*Xuán*), to depart from the essence’s application (*zhuàngxíng ér shàng*), and to ascend beyond form (*chéng shén guāng*), this is *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* (*shì yòu Xuán*).\nThe *Sutra of Strict Adherence* (*Léngyán*) says: *\"Subtle yet constant is tranquil, having and none are both none, none and none are also annihilated.\"*\nThis speaks of **nature** (*xìng*).\nEarlier, it was said that the scripture proceeds step by step (*cìdì*).\n*\"Step by step\"* refers to distinguishing **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*), and **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*) refer to dividing **Great Vehicle** (*dàchéng*) and **Small Vehicle** (*xiǎochéng*).\nThe **Great Vehicle** (*dàchéng*) and **Small Vehicle** (*xiǎochéng*) are arranged in stages of fruition (*jiēguǒ*).\nAs in the *Ocean of the Void and Wisdom Storehouse* (*Hǎikōng Zhìcáng*) discourse on having and none (*yǒuwú zhī yì*), the **ultimate subtlety** (*miàoyǒu*) and **ultimate none** (*miàowú*) are the consummation (*jiūjìng*).\nAs in the **Nature School** (*Xìngzōng*) discourse on **inner void** (*nèikōng*), **outer void** (*wàikōng*), **inner-outer void** (*nèiwài kōng*), **void of void** (*kōngkōng*), **great void** (*dàkōng*), **ultimate void** (*shèngyì kōng*), **void of conditioned dharma** (*yǒuwú kōng*), **void of unconditioned dharma** (*wúwéi kōng*), **ultimate void** (*jìngyì kōng*), **void without bounds** (*wújì kōng*), **scattered void** (*sǎnkōng*), **void without change** (*wúbiàn yì kōng*), **void of inherent nature** (*běnxìng kōng*), **void of self-nature** (*zìxiàng kōng*), **void of shared nature** (*gòngxìng kōng*), **void of all dharma** (*yīqiè fǎ kōng*), **void of attainability** (*bùkědé kōng*), **void of inherent nature and self-nature** (*wúxìng zìxìng kōng*), the principle has not yet reached its limit (*lǐ yóu wèi jí*).\nOnly *\"void of attainability\"* (*bùkědé kōng*) is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).\n\nThe term *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* sighs at the **Dao/Way**’s profound and distant nature (*dào zhī shēnyuǎn*).\nNo extremes are established (*èrbiān bù lì*), nor is the middle **Dao/Way** (*zhōngdào*) secured.\nSpeech and silence are inexhaustible (*yánmò fěi qióng*), yet it is called *\"the actual\"** (*shìshí*).\nThus, one does not tread upon emptiness (*bù shǐ bù jiè xū*), and this is the true **Oneness** (*zhēnyī*).\nThis is the attainment of having (*suǒwéi yǒudé*), the so-called *\"profound subtlety\"* (*wēimiào*).\n\nNow, we divide the gates of **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*), the stages of the three **Vehicles** (*sānchéng*), to verify the meaning of *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"*.\n\nBefore the **Mixed Primordial** (*Hùnyuán*), there was no name nor image (*wú míng wú xiàng*).\nOnce the **Mixed Primordial** (*Hùnyuán*) is distinguished (*bìpàn*), there are images and names (*yǒu xiàng yǔ míng*).\nFrom the time before namelessness (*zì wú míng yǐqián*), direct insight into its principle (*zhí wù qí lǐ*) is called **sudden** (*dùn*).\nIf from the time after having names (*cóng yǒu míng zhī hòu*), to subdue having and return to none (*shè yǒu guī wú*), this is called **gradual** (*jiàn*).\n**Sudden** (*dùn*) does not establish a single **dharma** (*bù lì yī fǎ*), while **gradual** (*jiàn*) begins with cultivation and practice (*shǐ yú xiūwéi*).\nThe gate of cultivation and practice (*xiūwéi zhī mén*) is inherently attained through teaching (*zì yánjiào dé*).\nThis is the so-called *\"daily progress\"* (*rìyì*).\nProgress yet capable of decline (*yì ér néng sǔn*), until *\"again decline\"* (*yòu sǔn*), one attains *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* (*zhèng yòu Xuán*).\nIn **nature** (*xìng*) it is so, and in **command** (*mìng*) it is also so.\nThe **Canon of Vitality and Health** (*Wèishēng zhī jīng*) begins with nurturing life (*yǎngshēng*), proceeds to prolonged life (*chángshēng*), and culminates in ascension to immortality (*fēixiān*).\nThe principle of **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*) each has its own tendency (*yǒu yóu qù*).\nThe meaning of *\"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)\"* is not the ultimate scope of the **middle** (*zhōng*) and **small** (*xiǎo*) **Vehicles** (*chéng*).\n\nThe **Supreme Lord of the Dao** (*Tàishàng Dàojūn*) says:\n*\"Neither void nor non-void, nor void of void,\nNeither **dharma** nor non-**dharma**, nor neither **dharma** nor non-**dharma**,\nNeither thing nor non-thing, nor neither thing nor non-thing,\nNeither person nor non-person, nor neither person nor non-person,\nNeither cause nor non-cause, nor neither cause nor non-cause,\nNeither fruit nor non-fruit, nor neither fruit nor non-fruit,\nNeither beginning nor non-beginning, nor neither beginning nor non-beginning,\nNeither end nor non-end, nor neither end nor non-end,\nNeither end nor non-end, nor neither end nor non-end,\nYet as the root and foundation of all **dharma** (*yīqiè zhūfǎ gēnběn*).\nWithout contrivance nor action (*wú zào wú zuò*), it is called **natural** (*zìrán*).\"*",
      "overlap_context": ") of having and none (*Yǒu wú èr lǐ*) is the same, yet the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is spoken of as void (*wú*), making it subtle yet unseen (*miào ér bù kě jiàn*).

      "translated_text": "The Sun is **yang**. Within the Sun lies the **crow**—**yin** containing **yang**. The Moon is **yin**. Within the Moon lies the **rabbit**—**yang** containing **yin**. Thus, there exists the **Dao/Way** of **yin** and **yang** reversing, the principle of **water** and **fire** requiring each other. The **Dao/Way** of **creation and transformation** is now clear.\n\nHaving known their positions, one must also know their **roots**—these are the **mixed origins** (*hùnyuán*) of Heaven and Earth. Having taken their **roots**, one must also take their **symbols**—these are the **paired symbols** of **yin** and **yang**. Having obtained their **symbols**, one must inquire into **movement and stillness**; when **movement and stillness** are clear, one must know their **numbers**; having known their **numbers**, one must follow the **water clock**; when the **water clock** is divided, one must clarify **advance and retreat**; when **advance and retreat** are clear, one must then **separate the Dragon and Tiger**.\n\nThen the boundaries of **south and north** are divided, and the forms of **metal and water** are united. Thus, the **Great Elixir** (*Dàdān*) may be refined.\n\nThere are also **internal and external methods and symbols**: **water** and **fire** have **dryness and moisture**; there are **cauldrons and chambers**; there are **fetal sacs**; there are **advance and retreat**; there are **hexagram symbols**; there are **omens of water and fire**; there are **rules for extraction and addition**; there are **patterns of the trigrams**; there are **forms of separation and union**. As mentioned above, each contains hidden profundity and mystery.\n\nOne must exhaust one’s wisdom and still seek instruction from a teacher. If one claims that the **mysterious pass** is a secret and leaves it unsaid, then where is the **doctrine of longevity**?\n\nPreviously, it was said: *\"The **nameless** is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the **named** is the mother of ten thousand things.\"* Speaking of **beginning** and **mother**, yet not speaking of **end**, one must infer the intent—this is called **grasping it**.\n\nAs for the **completion of the method** and the **principle of threefold perfection**, the **golden edicts and jade inscriptions** are recorded, the **Dao/Way** is transmitted, and the **doctrine of the Five Immortals** is elucidated. The **essentials of nine returns and seven transformations** are distinguished—this is the gathering of the **most profound mysteries**.\n\nAs for those of **minor attainment**, they are **initial profundity**; those of **medium attainment** are **ultimate profundity**; those of **great attainment** are **profoundest profundity**. This is seen in **cultivating the body and nurturing life**, **ingesting qi** and **refining the elixir**, ultimately achieving **transcendence and ascension**, ascending to the **ultimate profundity**—all of this has stages.\n\nLike their **nature**, from **empty delusion** to **true emptiness**; like their **life**, from **cultivated vitality** to **ascending to the True**—profound beyond profundity, its meaning is thus.\n\nTo **be able to be without** is not yet to **be able to be without without**; thus, one cannot yet be the **gate of all mysteries**. To **be able to nurture qi** is not yet to **be able to refine the spirit**; thus, one cannot yet grasp the **logic of profoundest profundity**. **Nature exists in emptiness**, **life exists in reality**—only then does the **gate of mysteries** appear, not inherently mysterious, but **mysterious in multitude**.\n\nThe **Six Canons** symbolize **virtue**. The **gate of all mysteries**—as the *Explanation of Characters* says—**three persons** constitute a **multitude**; this is not limited to three. From **Heaven and Earth** to **all things**, from **sentient beings** to **insentient things**, all are encompassed by it. Thus, it is called the **gate of all mysteries**.\n\nTruly reaching **profundity** is **exhausting one’s nature**; exhausting one’s nature is **oneness alone**. **Profoundest profundity** is **ultimate life**. Ultimate life enters **neither death nor birth**; thus, the **Dao/Way** has **no gate, no side paths**—it is the **vast and boundless sovereign**.\n\nIf one speaks of it as a **gate**, then the **Dao/Way** indeed has a **location**—this is incorrect. Speaking of it as a **gate** means it is not in any **location**; speaking of it as the **Dao/Way**, **nature has a returning movement**. Because of this returning movement, it is spoken of in terms of **entering and exiting**; yet speaking of **entering and exiting**, one has not yet seen **perfected nature**. When **nature is perfected**, there is nothing to perfect. Who exits? Who enters? Only then can one **gather all things** in the **ultimate void**, making the **mysterious oneness** an **unfathomable spirit**.\n\nThe *Classic of Change* says: *\"Perfected nature, abiding, abiding—this is the gate of Dao/Way and virtue.\"* Thus, **birth and death**, as the *Secret of the Dark* says, **\"Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life\"**—this is the **principle of the Dao/Way**. **Exiting mechanisms, entering mechanisms**—as the **Gèn** trigram says, **\"When the time to stop arrives, stop; when the time to move arrives, move.\"**\n\nThose who **exit without fear** have **embodied the Dao/Way**; those who **enter without delight** have **penetrated profundity**; and those who **exit and enter without knowing why they exit and enter** have **exhausted the mysteries**. Thus, knowing the **gate** means **penetrating the principles of life and death for all things**, revealing the **doctrine of the return of all things**, and indeed, all things **receive their mandate from the **nameless**—this is **emerging from the **nameless** to the **named****.\n\nThose who receive their mandate from the **Dao/Way** are all **mysterious**; thus, it is called **all mysteries**. How mysterious is it? Like **water**—those who **transgress** are **drowned**; all who are **born from the Dao/Way** possess **mystery**.\n\nNext, it is said: *\"I emerge from the **gate of all mysteries** and obtain **oneness**; **oneness** is within me. I shall carry this mystery and return, restoring my **root** and **command**, embodying **profoundest profundity**, and also being able to **master all mysteries**.\"* Like **fire**—**illuminating from myself**, all things are illuminated; **transforming from myself**, all things are transformed. Initially, the **Dao/Way’s mystery** is **me**; ultimately, **I** am also the **mystery of all things**. When one reaches this point, does the **Dao/Way** truly **mystify me**, or do **I** truly **mystify all things**? Ultimately, it advances to **unknowing**.\n\nShào Ruòyú says: *\"The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is the **gate of all mysteries**.\"* The **Great Dao/Way** is **utter void and utter stillness**, **formless and nameless**; it cannot be sought through **sight or hearing**, cannot be known through **thought or reasoning**, cannot be attained through **speech or language**. This is the **Dao/Way** of **no beginning and no end**, **constantly existing and unchanging**. From **primordial void**, it **transforms into one qi**; because there is a **trace of one qi**, it is thus **speakable**.\n\nSince it is said to be **speakable**, it is not the **constantly existing Dao/Way**; since there is a **name of qi**, it is not the **constantly existing name**. Before **one qi** manifested, in the **formless and nameless** time, this was the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**. This is the **Dao/Way** that cannot be spoken of. When there is the **name of one qi**, it is the **mother of ten thousand things**—this is the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of.\n\nThus, one knows that **my body** emerges from **oneness**, and **human ability** can take **oneness** as **law**. Upon **awakening and entering**, one sees the **Great Dao/Way**. The **Great Dao/Way** is **human true heart**; **one qi** is the **desire born from the heart**.",

      "translated_text": "The true heart is originally empty and tranquil, without birth or annihilation. When the true heart moves, it becomes manifest, and its names are desire-thought, wisdom, intuition, and cognition. Because the heart gives rise to desire, one follows desire and receives birth. After birth, one accepts and rejects pleasures and evils, clings endlessly to the five colors and five sounds, relies on strength and arrogance to dwell in honor or humiliation, and is deluded by false thoughts. Clinging to this false heart, one covers the true heart, failing to comprehend the Dao/Way of **one qi**.\n\nIf one abandons falsehood and desire, then one attains **oneness**. This heart, when held, is upright; when obtained, it is luminous. As the mother of ten thousand things, it is also the root of birth and death. Desire covers the true heart, hence there is birth and death.\n\nIf one can be without desire, then being without desire is empty and tranquil, returning to the formless beginning. Thus, one can transcend birth and death.\n\nHence, Laozi says: *\"Constantly without desire, one observes the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\"* This is the subtle mystery of transcending birth and death. Again, he says: *\"Constantly with desire, one observes the Dao/Way of one qi.\"* This is the perilous edge.\n\nShallow understanding cannot seek the heart with the heart—this is having desire. It cannot annihilate the heart with the heart—this is being without desire. These two—having and not having—are both encompassed as one principle. When spoken of as teaching, they are distinguished by the names \"having\" and \"not having.\"\n\nWhen having and not having merge, it is called **Xuan** (the Mysterious). The Buddhist School calls it the **\"Non-dual Dharma Gate\"** or the **\"Middle Way.\"** The gate of **Xuan** takes the Middle as its law, like a net analogy. Yet since the law arises from the heart, and once it arises in the heart, it clings to the Middle—this is not empty and tranquil.\n\nLaozi feared the Middle Way’s law would bind, preventing one from abandoning the net. Thus, he further explained with **Xuan**, teaching that the student should neither cling to having or not having nor dwell in the Middle Way of **Xuan**. In actual practice, the ground of reality is untouched by even a speck of dust, and the heart becomes empty and tranquil—this is **wuwei** (non-action), so no need for contemplation.\n\nBecause there is no attainment, this is being without desire. Hence, no dust arises, and it is called **clearing and tranquility**; there is no action, so it is called **wuwei**; there is no cultivation or realization, so it is called **natural**; there is nothing at all, so it is called **empty and tranquil**; it is unrestrained and free, so it is called **soaring**; it is uniformly ordinary, so it is called **serene and simple**.\n\nThus, when the heart is without desire, it departs from all distinctions. Departing from distinctions, there is no affliction. When the heart is without desire, encountering things there is no self. Without self, there is no conflict, hence no blame.\n\nWhen the heart is without desire, it departs from all good and evil. Departing from good and evil, it is not bound by cause and effect. When the heart is without desire, it does not cling to all things, hence there is no birth, and without birth, there is no death.\n\nThe heart that is constantly without desire is the gate of all mysteries. King Zhi-ran says: *\"The Dao that can be spoken of reaches the gate of all mysteries.\"* The Dao that cannot be spoken of—when spoken of, it is not so. The Dao that cannot be named—when named, it is not so. Calling it the Dao, can it not be spoken of? The Dao that can be spoken of is not the naturally constant Dao. The name that can be named is not the naturally arising name.\n\nThe constantly constant Dao and constantly constant name, like a ring without end, like the four seasons in their course—never beginning, never ending, yet arising and vanishing in turn, decaying and reviving, are not what I call the truly constant.\n\nConstantly without desire, one observes its mystery—this is the substance of the Dao. Constantly with desire, one observes its perilous edge—this is the function of the Dao. Yet substance and function are always concealed in **huanghu** (obscurity and confusion). Between the subtle and coarse, the profound and the obscure, it cannot be known by wisdom, cannot be perceived by cognition, nor can it be attained through sight, hearing, or response.\n\nHow then does one attain it? There are those who learn and know it; there are none who know it without learning.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Without thought, without action, silently unmoving, yet responding and thus communicating with all under Heaven.\"*\n\nYangzi says: *\"Plow the Dao and obtain the Dao; hunt virtue and obtain virtue.\"*\n\nMencius says: *\"Self-obtained.\"*\n\nWhen self-obtained, one encounters the source on all sides. When study reaches the point of encountering the source on all sides, then where does one go without carrying it?\n\nThe so-called \"obtaining\" refers to obtaining this.\n\nAh! The mystery of the Dao suffices to exhaust the nature of all things. The subtlety of the Dao suffices to fathom the principles of all things. Nature and mystery are one in profundity, and the so-called having and not having—can they not be observed together and dualistically extinguished?\n\nSome say: *\"Having having, not having not having—what does this mean?\"* This speaks of how having and not having alternate thus: not having is true having, having is true not having. Having and not having interdependently arise, never differing.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"These two emerge together but have different names. They are called **Xuan** because its color is dark and faint, red and black, yin and yang mingling in steam—all unified.\"*\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"One yin and one yang is called the Dao; the unfathomable yin and yang is called the Spirit.\"* Yin and yang, having and not having, are all unified.\n\nUnified in one, yet not yet mysterious in one; mysterious in one, yet not yet mysterious in multiplicity; mysterious in multiplicity, yet not yet mysterious in self and things. Hence, it is said: *\"Spirit is the mysterious speech of all things.\"*\n\n**Xuan** beyond **Xuan**, then one and multiplicity, self and things—all are mysteriously unified. This is the so-called gate of all mysteries.\n\nThus, Laozi begins his first chapter with the profound meaning of **repeated Xuan**, reaching the most profound and distant principles, which cannot be exceeded. This is what students should devote their hearts to.\n\nProgram Tai-zhi says: *\"The Dao that can be spoken of reaches the unnameable.\"* Without distinctions of self/other, past/future, always thus—this is its constancy. If it can do this but not that, if it was once thus but is not now, then it cannot be called constant.\n\nBefore the Dao becomes virtue, it is indistinct and boundless, encompassing all things in one. Within it, it can be firm or yielding, real or empty, short or long, responding to all stimuli with countless differences, yet not adhering to any particular thing or event—so what can it not respond to, what can it not accomplish?\n\n---\n*(Note: \"重玄\" [chóng xuán] is rendered as \"repeated Xuan\" to preserve the layered profundity, though \"double mystery\" or \"ultimate mystery\" could also serve. \"恍惚\" [huanghu] is \"obscurity and confusion,\" a Daoist term for the ineffable state beyond duality.)*",

      "translated_text": "The absence of distinctions between self and other, past and future—this is its constancy. Those who grasp the Dao understand its boundless essence and thus speak clearly of its unchanging nature, calling it *constant*.\n\nWhen the Dao manifests as virtue, virtue solidifies into principles—*ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (ritual), *zhi* (wisdom)—all dwelling within the Dao yet unfolding into specific deeds. Once named and defined, they adhere to particular forms and limits. Thus, this virtue cannot encompass other virtues, nor can its name serve as another’s. Therefore, what can be spoken of as the Dao is no longer the *constant Dao*, and what can be named is not the *constant Name*.\n\nThe unnamed is the origin of heaven and earth.\nHeaven and earth—governing all creation, opening and closing, generating and transforming—are already vast within their domain. Yet Laozi further ascends beyond them, establishing another category and naming it *Wu* (the Non-being). He declares that this *Wu* is what can be called the origin of heaven and earth. Such claims, the Confucian scholars doubt as empty boasts.\n\nYet the *Yijing*’s two principles (*yin* and *yang*) are heaven and earth, but what gives rise to them is truly the *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate). The *Taiji* is neither heaven nor earth, yet it encompasses both, standing supreme. At that stage, no forms exist to be cast aside, no numbers to be counted—thus Laozi renames it *Wu*. Though their names differ, their essence is the same. His disciples knew later ages would doubt this, so Zhuangzi framed a question and answered it himself:\n\n*\"If form arises from the formless, how did heaven and earth come to be?\"*\nThus, it is said that *Wu* gives rise to heaven and earth.\nEven Zhuangzi knew people would doubt, so he clarified: Before heaven and earth formed, within the formless there were four stages: *Taiyi* (Great Unity), *Taichu* (Great Commencement), *Taishi* (Great Beginning), *Taosu* (Great Primordial)—this is their order. Though their *qi*, form, and substance were present yet undivided, they could only be called *hunlun* (indistinct chaos).\n\nOnly when movement and transformation occurred did the light and clear rise as heaven, the heavy and turbid settle as earth. Thus, the *Taiji* is precisely that which dwells in emptiness, embracing both purity and turbidity, establishing itself in an unmatched state of non-action. Is this not the indistinct yet formless?\n\nLaozi names it *Wu*, preceding heaven and earth—this aligns with the *Yijing*’s logic.\n\nThe named is the mother of all things.\nA later passage states: *\"All things under heaven arise from the having; having arises from the non-being.\"* When it is *Wu*, it is simply vast and boundless. Yet all things emerge from it, so calling *Wu* the origin of heaven and earth is still plausible. But once it enters *You* (the having), how does it differ from other things, yet still generate them?\n\nIt is the *Wu* that has stirred yet not yet solidified into things. Examining its boundaries, it is the *hunlun*—about to move but not yet manifest. On the verge of being named *Wu*, it already differs from *Wu*; on the verge of being called *wu* (thing), it lacks defined form. Thus, studying its core, it is named *You*.\n\nWhen it fully takes shape and is called *wanwu* (ten thousand things), they are all fixed in form and substance: heaven and earth, sun and moon, rain and dew, mountains and rivers, grasses and trees, humans and beasts, tools and vessels—all clearly defined, not merely *You*.\n\nLaozi describes this *You* in three shifting names, yet they share one essence. Numerically, it is *One*—capable of generating all yet not yet all. Figuratively, it is *Xiang* (image); practically, it is *Pu* (uncarved block). *Xiang* and *Pu* can both become form and vessel, yet their form and vessel remain uncoagulated. Thus, above it is not yet *Wu*, below it is not yet *wu*—this *You* transcends past and future, self and other, as the eternal progenitor of all things. Hence, a later passage declares: *\"All things under heaven have a beginning, which is the mother of all things under heaven.\"* Zhuangzi’s theory of origins stems from this.\n\nLaozi himself knew this truth would be hard to grasp at once, so he further explained, moving from the whole to the particular: *\"There is a thing, indistinctly formed, existing before heaven and earth. Silent and boundless, it stands alone yet never changes, revolves eternally yet leaves no trace—it can be the mother of all things under heaven. I do not know its name; I call it the Dao, forcefully name it the Great.\"*\n\n*Mixing and forming*—this is the undivided state. It is the indistinct unity of *Wu* and *You* before differentiation. Existing before heaven and earth, it is where they truly originate. Standing alone, revolving eternally, it is the mother of all things under heaven—truly without a child, yet the source of all.\n\nThese three aspects encompass the origin of all things and phenomena under heaven. Laozi’s text omits what the *Six Classics* already elaborate, yet delves deeply into what they leave unexplored. The *Six Classics* exhaust the discussion of governance when reaching the Dao, but Laozi ascends beyond the Dao’s mother—heaven and earth—to higher realms: *Wu*, *Xuan*, and *repeated Xuan*—these are its domains.",

They simply refused to burden themselves with personal desires, so their reverence for *Wu*’s power—though not fully realizing the Dao—sufficed to cultivate emptiness and still chaos, never entangling themselves in worldly matters.\n\nBy the time of the Western Jin, however, rituals, music, laws, and governance were abandoned in favor of absolute *Wu*, leaving no structure or order, and the Jin dynasty collapsed in chaos. Thus, those who study Laozi must recognize that within *wuwei* lies *wu buwei*—what is not done—and only then can they understand how Han and Jin governance, though rooted in the same source, produced such divergent outcomes.\n\nAs for those who falsely claim *wuwei* as their practice, naming themselves Daoists while fabricating absurd tales of transcendence, fortune, and misfortune, these are not Laozi’s words.\n\nTracing their origins, tales of immortality arose in the Warring States, while prayers for retribution and responses flourished in the Han—yet none of this appears in the *Eighty-One Chapters*.\n\nShould students of Laozi adhere to the original eighty-one chapters, or to the later embellishments of fantastical speech?\n\nShould rulers and ministers emulate Zhang Liang, Cao Parameter, and Emperor Wen, or the reckless excesses of the Jin and the bizarre later traditions?\n\nThese are clear lessons—easy to discern, yet essential to heed.\n\nEver without desire, one may observe its boundaries.",

      "translated_text": "The capacity to generate the **Having** from the **Non-Having**, yet not claiming itself as the **Having**, is how one may perpetually abide in the **Non-Having**.\n\nThe capacity to generate **Things** from the **Having**, yet not claiming itself as **Things**, is how one may perpetually abide in the **Having**.\n\nHow so? Before form and substance take root, within there is no separation or interruption, hence it may be perpetuated. But when one derives form and substance from **Creation-Transformation** (造化), and emerges from the **Dao/Way** to manifest as **virtue/power** (德), **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **propriety**, and **ritual**, these are all **Things**.\n\nWhen these **Things** are perpetually congealed without dispersion, they may be named. If the **Having** is dispersed, then there is **Non-Having**. Thus, once the **Having** has become **Things**, all that has ever taken form cannot master its own **Having**.\n\nWhen myriad **Things** arise together in their **keynote** (芸芸) state, and those that return to their root and wither become **bare** (枯秃), they may be awaited. For those who already possess the **Having**, since it cannot be retained, they revert to **command** (复命), and when the **stillness** (静) of the **Non-Having** once more overflows like spring’s nourishment, all that emerges in **keynote** cannot restrain itself, and thus retreats into the **Non-Having**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way’s** attainment or loss, along with the **spokes-and-hub** (辐毂) and **door-and-window** (户牖) of its implements—all are governed by a single principle. Thus, the **Having** and **Non-Having** of the world are insufficient to trace the **outer and inner** (表里) of the **Great Dao/Way**.\n\nThose who perpetually abide in **Non-Having** are the **Dao/Way’s** essence yet to emerge. Those who perpetually abide in the **Having** are the **Dao/Way’s** movement already tending toward emergence.\n\nThese are all **Things** yet not ensnared by **Things**, hence they may encompass all **Creation-Transformation** without being consumed by it. With their dwelling in totality and their substance embracing all, the beginning and end of the **Great Dao/Way** may be sought within them.\n\nThat which is called **Mysterious** (妙) dwells in the depths of **Creation-Transformation**, where all **Having** originates. This is the **Non-Having** yet to be encompassed by totality.\n\nThat which is called **Boundary** (徼) is the **edge**, like the four corners of a frontier marking the boundaries of a central kingdom. It is the **Non-Having** that has emerged as **Having**, yet has not yet fully become **Things**. Hence it cannot be called **Mysterious** and is perpetually the **Boundary**.\n\nWith these two distinctions established, the **outer and inner** (表里) of the **Dao/Way** may be measured. To attain **Non-Having** and dwell within it is to explore the origin of all **Having** and perceive its **inner**; to attain the **Having** and dwell within it is to exhaust the production of all **Things** and perceive their **outer**.\n\nThus, Laozi esteems the perpetuation of **Non-Having** and **Having**, for within them the **outer and inner** of the **Dao/Way** may be imagined.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Those who perceive the **Having** are the virtuous gentlemen of old; those who perceive the **Non-Having** are the friends of Heaven and Earth.\"* This aligns with the principle.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* (《易》) states: *\"That which is above form is called the **Dao/Way**; that which is below form is called the **instrument** (器).\"* The **Dao/Way** is the **instrument**, and the **instrument** is the **Dao/Way**. It is merely that their forms are above or below, not that they are two distinct entities.\n\nThis **Mysterious** and **Boundary** are the *Book of Changes*’s **above** and **below**. Those who abandon the **above** and **below** yet name it **Mysterious** and **Boundary** seek only to establish their own school, though their ultimate intent is not fundamentally different.\n\nIn the world, how could there be anything below that lacks support and yet stands empty above? Or anything **inner** without its **outer**?\n\nThis is the mutual reliance of **Dao/Way** and **instrument**, **Having** and **Non-Having**, clearly evident and easily understood. Hence, they are borrowed to illustrate that within the discourse on **Mysterious**, **Boundary** is never neglected.\n\nThese two are of the same origin yet bear different names. The **Having** is **Boundary** to the **Non-Having**, while the **Non-Having** is **Mysterious** to the **Having**. When they have already emerged, the **Having** and **Non-Having** may indeed be divided. But before emergence, they are indistinguishably merged, hence it is said they are the same.\n\nThe same is **One**. **One** is not yet **One**, for from it the **Three** may generate the **Myriad**, yet it has not yet reached the **Myriad**.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* and the Five Classics, as well as the *Discourses* (《论》) and *Mencius* (《孟》), have all spoken of **One**, yet none have explained how it is **One**.\n\nLaozi’s disciples, however, have elaborately expounded upon this. They speak of **\"indistinct unity\"** (混成), **\"indistinctly merged\"** (浑沦), and **\"indistinct chaos\"** (浑沌)—all describing its undivided state.\n\nFrom its emergence before division, it is named **\"same\"** (同); from its **Non-Having** and **matching\"** (匹) not yet being so, it is named **\"alone\"** (独); and from its **Non-Having** not being otherwise, it is named **\"perpetual\"** (常). All these terms emphasize its totality and clarify its essence.\n\nWhen the **Non-Having** has emerged as **Having** yet not fully become **Things**, it is again given distinctions—named **\"One\"** (一), **\"Uncarved\"** (朴), or **\"Form\"** (象)—all taken from its capacity to encompass the **Myriad** in unity, for the names arise from what it contains.\n\nThus, Laozi’s discourse on the **Dao/Way** is particularly detailed here. Though its branches and leaves may greatly diverge from Confucian teachings, even Confucians cannot help but draw upon its **Mysterious** insights.\n\nHence, the profound in **Dao/Way** can still align the disparate to serve the unified; while the shallow in **Dao/Way**, to the point of declaring that Confucius does not belong to a single school, are like those who pass through a doorway yet fail to recognize the halls and chambers within.\n\nThe unified is called **Dark** (玄). Five colors find **black** as their **Dark**, Heaven’s color is **Dark** in its boundless expanse, the **Great Dark** (太玄) of the **Vague** (罔) is direct, and in winter, all **Things** return to their root, **revert to command** (复命), without visible boundaries—this is named **Dark**.\n\nThus, **Dark** refers to the **profound and distant**. The *Liezi*’s statement that *\"the **Dao/Way** is formless and ends in the **Dark**\"* is precisely this teaching.\n\nThe unified is called **Dark**, for **Having** and **Non-Having** merge, indistinctly merged without separation, hence it may be called **profound and distant**.\n\nIf their traces are faintly discernible, then the **Non-Having** is truly hidden within the **Non-Having**, while the **Having** is truly formed within the **Having**. Once distinctions begin to emerge, it cannot again be called **Dark**.\n\nThe **Dark** beyond **Dark**, is the gateway to myriad **Mysterious** insights. When all **Having** is indistinctly merged into **Non-Having**, it has reached its extreme.\n\nNow, advancing further upward, there is yet another **Dark**.

From ancient times to the present, the world relies on them for sustenance, like the **Five Grains** and **Cloth of Raw Silk** (*Bùmáo*), without which life cannot thrive, and with which it flourishes. None can replace them, nor is there another principle as profound.\n\nYet Laozi establishes a teaching that seeks to utterly abandon sages’ wisdom, virtue, and righteousness, and revert to the **beginning of knotted cords** (*Jiégǒu*).\n\nThose who take the **Six Classics** as their profession collectively uphold and reject this teaching, even labeling his work as a **heretical doctrine**. Yet the **Ten Thousand Words** (*Wàn Yī Yán*) persist alongside the **Six Classics**, never truly discarded—why is this?\n\nThe **Six Classics** elucidate **rites and laws**, so their texts are all about **instruments** (*Qì*). Yet regarding the **Dao/Way**, they offer only a brief outline.\n\nLaozi exhausts the **Dao/Way** in its **constant Non-Having** (*Cháng Wú*), yet omits mention of **instruments** (*Qì*).\n\nThough their focus differs—one detailed, the other sparse—**instruments** (*Qì*) bear the **Dao/Way**, and the **Dao/Way** generates **instruments** (*Qì*). They cannot be separated into two distinct paths.\n\nSeeking the **Dao/Way**, one must ascend from lower learning to higher attainment, yet the **Six Classics** do not fully explore its depths.\n\nLaozi, however, has fully expounded its profound essence.\n\nThus, those who study the **Dao/Way** and glimpse its truth find no language in the **Six Classics** to verify it, and so they align with Laozi’s words to elucidate its **virtue/power** (*Dé*).\n\nHence, though his teaching appears contradictory to theirs, the **Dao/Way** remains concurrent—there is good reason for this.\n\nAh! This principle is subtle indeed, too profound to be grasped in a single utterance.\n\nNow, let me take the most accessible yet closest examples from ancient times to clarify it, so all may understand.\n\n**Agriculture** is the foundation of civilization, yet its practice is the most coarse.\n\nThe teachings of the **Six Classics** speak of the timing for plowing, sowing, harvesting, and storing—of the tools before the **plow** (*Sì*), **hoe** (*Chuán*), **weeder** (*Zhì*), and **reaper** (*Zhì*). These are the most **concrete** (*Xíng*) and **lowly** (*Yuè*) of all **instruments** (*Qì*).\n\nYet the transformations of the four seasons depend on these **instruments** for their manifestation, and the seeds of a hundred grains achieve their fullness through them.\n\nEven if the **original Qi** of Heaven and Earth is beyond naming, it still relies on these **instruments** to manifest its functions—how can one claim the **Dao/Way** is absent simply because its tools are present?\n\nAs for Laozi’s **Dao/Way**, he exhausts its utmost **Mysterious** essence.\n\nHe rejects the governance of **eastern labor and western harvest** (*Dōng Zuò Xī Chéng*), yet even in his texts, though he speaks of all things arising and returning to their roots—too numerous to enumerate—he still provides tools for **planting** (*Zhòng*), **harvesting** (*Shuō*), **nurturing** (*Yǎng*), and **pruning** (*Fá*).\n\nYet Laozi never utters a word on these matters.\n\nWhen discussing the **subtle** and **Mysterious**, he still considers the **hinge of Heaven and Earth’s transformations** (*Tiān Dì Shēnghuà zhī Shuā*) and the **beginning of virtue and Dao** (*Dé Dào Yǔncáng zhī Shǐ*) as shallow, directly probing the origins of Heaven and Earth—**“how did Heaven and Earth come to be Heaven and Earth?”**—and the **Dark Non-Having**—**“how could the **Dark Non-Having** be **Dark Non-Having**?”**—only to name them in accordance with his intent.\n\nThus, his teaching seems entirely distinct from the **Six Classics**.\n\nYet, by examining his spoken words to infer what he does not say, and by seeking what he cannot help but imply despite his reluctance to speak openly, one finds that **virtue** (*Dé*), **righteousness** (*Rén*), and **rites** (*Yì*) are never truly absent, nor are **taxes** (*Shuì*), **punishments** (*Xíng*), **military force** (*Bīng*), **criminal law** (*Xíng*), and the **practical tools of daily life**—**chickens, dogs, boats, and carts** (*Jī Quǎn Zhōuchē*).\n\nThough his words often exalt **Non-Having**, they never truly abandon **Having**.\n\nIn the first chapter, he reaches the extreme of **Dark** beyond **Dark**, yet he transcends the myriad **Mysterious** and governs their emergence.\n\nWhen observing **Having**, it frequently appears in contrast with the **Mysterious** and **Non-Having**, standing parallel yet distinct—this **Having** and these **instruments** (*Qì*) are never truly separate.\n\nSages’ wisdom, virtue, and righteousness are never truly discarded.\n\nThus, when reading Laozi’s words, within the utmost **Non-Having**, one finds the **virtue/power** (*Dé*) of all **Having** and **Mysterious**—it must originate from **tracing** (*Jiànjì*).\n\nHuang Maocai says: *“The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is not the **constant Non-Having**.”*\n\n**Constant** (*Cháng*) here means **enduring** and **permanent**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** begins and ends with Heaven and Earth—how could it be anything but enduring and permanent? Who could truly speak of it?\n\nIf the **Dao/Way** could be spoken of and named, then the world’s understanding would suffice as **constant**.\n\nThe Classics say: *“I do not know its name, so I call it **Dao/Way**.”*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is singular and absolute—why then does it oppose **name** (*Míng*)?\n\nLaozi’s intent is to reveal the **enduring and permanent** **Dao/Way** to people, is it not?\n\n**Non-Having** is the **mother of myriad things**.\n\nAt the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**, was there truly **Non-Having**?\n\nIf there was indeed **Non-Having**, who then gave rise to it?\n\n**Non-Having** is **Non-Naming**—**Non-Naming** is **Non-Having**—it cannot be named, so it is called thus.»",

The sage saw that this was the mother of all things yet **without form (无形)**, so he **forced a term upon it (强字)**, calling it Dao/Way, and **assigned a name to it (强为之名)**, calling it *Great (大)*. Because it was originally unnamed yet forced to be named, he did so that all people might **borrow this name (假此有名)** and **investigate its unnameable essence (探其无名)**, thereby **restoring its original state (以复其初)**.\n\nThus, **one must habitually lack desire (常无欲)** to perceive its subtlety (妙).\n**\"Habitually lacking desire (常无欲)\"**—**habitually without fixed speech (常无绝句)**, observing the *departing voice (去声)*, scrutinizing it closely (谛视).\n**\"Subtlety (妙)\"**—**the ultimate subtlety (徼妙)**, the constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way.\nFrom ancient times, it has always existed, yet **without form or sound (无形无声)**, so **exquisitely subtle (微妙)** that it cannot be fully exhausted. Hence, it is called *constant unnameable (常无)*, intending to **urge people to observe its subtlety (以观其微妙)**.\n\nOnly humans, born from this Dao/Way, are the most **responsive (灵)** of all things. If they truly **retrace the light and reflect inward (回光反视)** within themselves, **awakening to the single true essence (悟一真体)**, though it be **utterly void (至虚)**, yet **nothing is lacking (物无不备)**, then the Dao’s subtlety can be **perceived and observed (可得而观)**.\n\nThus, one comes to know that **one principle encompasses all particulars (一理包乎万殊)**, and all things and affairs **cannot defy (不可违)** the natural principle.\n\n**One must habitually have desire (常有欲)** to perceive its **manifestation (徼)**.\n**\"Habitually having desire (常有欲)\"**—**habitually with fixed speech (常有绝句)**, observing the *level voice (平声)*, **manifestation (徼)**, which is **to follow (循)**, **the realm (境)**, **or return (归)**.\nThe Great Dao/Way is natural and spontaneous, transforming and giving rise to all things. In heaven, it manifests as the forms of sun, moon, stars, and galaxies (星汉); on earth, as mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees; in humans, as the substance of **body, hair, and skin (身体发肤)**. Hence, it is called *constant having (常有)*, intending to **urge people to observe its manifestations (以观其境)**.\n\nOnly humans, **standing between heaven and earth (中天地)** as one of the *Three Powers (三才)*, if they **contemplate above and examine below (仰观俯察)** within the *Two Principles (两仪)*, realize that though all things have different forms, the principle is **never absent (无不在)**. Then, the Dao’s **manifestations and subtleties (境致)** can be **perceived and observed (可得而观)**.\n\nThus, one comes to know that **all particulars return to one principle (万殊归於一理)**, and all things and affairs **must follow (固当)** the natural principle.\n\nThese two—**constant unnameable (常无)** and **constant having (常有)**—are called *Dao (道)*.\n*\"Dao (道)\"* refers to **that which is profound

it.\nIf one considers the Dao/Way as **existence (有)**, then it is **formless and soundless (无形无声)**, ever **unchanging (常常不变)**.\nHence, it is said: **constant unnameable, constant having (常无常有)**.\n\nAbove the **non-existent and existent (无有)**, both are **marked with the character *constant (常)***, pointing to its **root (本)**.\nSince it is **neither existent nor non-existent (无有不二)**, yet **profound and distant (深远)**, it is exhaustively called *Dao (道)*.\n\nI have often thought that **existence and non-existence (有无)** alone are **insufficient to discuss the Dao/Way (论道)**.\nYet, from its **subtlety (微妙)**, one cannot avoid calling it *constant unnameable (常无)*;\nfrom its **manifestation (着见)**, one cannot avoid calling it *constant having (常有)*.\n\nWhen

**gateway to all subtleties (众妙之门)**.\nThe constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way **cannot be fully expressed by names or words (不可以名言)**.\nNow, since it is **forced to be termed (强字)** as Dao/Way,\nand from its **subtlety (微妙)**, it is called *constant unnameable (常无)*,\nand from its **manifestation (着见)**, it is called *constant having (常有)*.\nAgain, from its **root’s unity of existence and non-existence (本之有无不二)**,\nprofound and distant, yet **inexhaustible (难穷)**, it is **equally called *Dao (玄)***.\nAll these are **inevitably bound by words (不免乎言焉)**.\n\n*\"Dao that is again Dao (玄之又玄)\"*—\nthis is **like saying *profound that is again profound (深之又深)*, distant that is again distant (远之又远)***.\nIt is **neither non-existence nor existence (非无非有)**,\n**neither different nor the same (非异非同)**,\n**unknown in its *so-and-so-yet-so (所以然)***,\nyet **cannot be fully named or spoken of (终不可得而名言)**,\nfor it is **beyond distinction (分别)**.\n\nYet, all transformations arise from it, each **possessing its own subtlety (各各具妙)**,\nhence it is called **the gateway to all subtleties (众妙之门)**.\n\nLaozi **pities (悯)** that **people of the world chase superficiality (逐末)** while **forgetting the root (忘本)**,\nand **lose the true source (失真源)**.\nUnable to help but **respond to the times (应运)** and **deliver his teachings (垂训)**,\nhe also **fears that people will drown in words (溺於言辞)**,\nand **cannot reflect inward (弗能内观)**.\nThus, he **further instructs (示人以深意)**,\n**compelling them to seek within themselves (必使反求诸己)**,\n**desiring they attain it themselves (欲其自得之)**,\nand **enter the gateway to all subtleties (以入众妙之门)**,\n**restoring its original state (以复其初)**.\nThey can also **embody and act upon it (体是而行)**,\n**assisting the natural transformation of all things (以辅万物之自然)**,\nand **returning to unity (而同归于一)**.\n\nOnly humans are the most **responsive (灵)** of all things.\nIf they truly **reflect inward (反观)**, this Dao/Way **will remain luminously present (湛然常存)**—\nhow could it be **distant (远)**?\n\nThis chapter **directly points to the initial state of this mind (直指此心之初)**,\nthe natural principle,\n**preventing confusion over existence and non-existence, same and different (不惑於有无同异)**,\n**realizing the intent beyond words (得意忘言)**,\n**ascending to the profound and attaining subtlety (升玄及妙)**,\nand **entering the Dao’s gateway (乃入道之门)**.\n\n**Establishing the foundation of virtue (立德之基)**,\nthis is **the essence of the entire teaching (实一经之总)**.\nIt should be **deeply savored (宜深味之)**.\n\nXu Jun Yue said:\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is the gateway to the Dao/Way.\"*\nThe first four sentences state that the Dao/Way **cannot be conveyed through speech (不可以言语道说)**,\nnor **labeled with names (不可以名字题号)**.\n\nYet,

      "translated_text": "Now that the Dao/Way has been named, how can it also be called \"the Nameless\" as the mother of all things?\n\nThis refers to the period **after** heaven and earth came into being—speaking of the **manifested forms** beneath the Dao/Way. The Dao/Way does not arise only at this stage. Yet once it **adheres to these forms**, it takes on **concrete traces** and a **fixed position**, standing in contrast to the Nameless when spoken of.\n\nIf one points to this as \"the Named,\" what then is the \"Nameless\"? To sever the discussion with the terms \"Named\" and \"Nameless\" alone is to disrupt the logic.\n\nThe next four sentences then speak of those who embody the Dao/Way and turn inward to examine themselves. They first use the term *\"without desire\"* to express it—those who are perpetually without desire are **pure in Dao/Way and nature**, born in stillness. Here, one observes its **subtlety**.\n\n*\"Subtlety\"* means **so refined as to be invisible**, yet when one speaks of observing it, it must be **manifest yet not obscure**, revealing what others do not know.\n\nThose who truly understand it **always have desire**, for this is the human heart responding to external stimuli.\n\nFrom birth, humans are endowed with form, and the desires of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and limbs all have their objects—yet they cannot be entirely absent. Here, one observes its **boundaries**.\n\n*\"Boundaries\"* means **to follow through**, or the **extreme limits** of the heart’s desires, tracing where they lead without falling into ruin.\n\nThus, the Dao/Way and its manifestations are inseparable—what distinguishes humans from other beings.\n\nIn the realm of heaven and earth, it is called **\"the Nameless\"** and **\"the Named.\"**\nIn the human body, it is called **\"without desire\"** and **\"with desire.\"**\nIf one rigidly separates the terms \"Named\" and \"Nameless,\" the meaning still falls short.\n\nThese two aspects, though differently named, share the same origin and are both called **\"the Mysterious.\"**\nThough their names differ, their source is one.\n\n*\"The Mysterious\"* carries the meaning of **profound and distant**, and when it is said *\"the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious,\"* it is the **portal to all subtleties**—if one says this is the Dao/Way, it is **empty and boundless**, the most profound and distant, yet the source of all movement, stillness, yin, yang, and the transformations of all things.\n\nWhen Laozi speaks of the Dao/Way, he precedes this chapter and nowhere is it more crucial than here. Yet when our sages speak of the Dao/Way, they say it is **\"without sound, without scent, without form,\"** yet they do not call it simply **\"non-existence.\"**\nIf one follows the next chapter—*\"There is something formless and complete\"*—how could it be said the Dao/Way is merely non-existence?\n\nThe terms \"Named\" and \"Nameless\" do not contradict each other. Those who understand the Dao/Way **silently recognize it**, and only then do they grasp the meaning of **\"the Boundless\"** and **\"the Supreme Polarity,\"** a truth that will never confuse the ages to come.\n\nXue Yongzhai says:\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao/Way.\nSilent and unmoving, this is the Eternal Dao/Way.\nResponding and thus harmonizing, this is the Dao/Way that can be spoken of.\nBefore joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise, this is the Middle—**the Eternal Dao/Way**.\nWhen they arise yet remain measured, this is Harmony—**the Dao/Way that can be spoken of**.\nThe Eternal Dao/Way is its **essence**; the Dao/Way that can be spoken of is its **function**.\nFrom sincerity comes clarity—**applying essence to function**.\nFrom clarity comes sincerity—**applying function to essence**.\"*\n\nWen Xuanxian says:\n*\"To read Laozi without understanding essence and function is to make entry difficult.\nThe Name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.\nThe Nameless Name is the Eternal Name.\nThe Named Name is the Name that can be named.\nThe Nameless is the mother of all things.\nThe Dao/Way originally had no name; it lost heaven and earth, hence 'the beginning.'\nThe Dao/Way, once named, gives birth to all things, hence 'the mother.'\nThe Eternal 'without desire' leads to observing its subtlety.\nThe Nameless and Named speak of the Dao/Way;\nThe without desire and with desire speak of humanity.\nObserving subtlety while without desire is to observe its essence in stillness.\nObserving boundaries while with desire is to observe its function in action.\nTo fail to know essence and function is to grasp only one side—either subtlety or boundaries.\nThese two aspects, when seen as identical, are called 'the Mysterious.'\nWhen viewed from their differences, they are like the liver and gallbladder, Chu and Yue.\nWhen viewed from their unity, all things are one.\nIf difference and unity align, and subtlety and boundaries are both forgotten, this can be called 'the Mysterious.'\n'The Mysterious' is the fundamental principle of the Dao/Way.\n'The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious' is the gateway to all subtleties.\nThe Mysterious is difficult to know; even when known, it still depends on something, hence 'beyond the Mysterious' is discarded.\nIf one attains 'the Mysterious yet not the Mysterious,' subject and object merge, and the Great Harmony of all transformations emerges from this.\"*\n\nXiu Xiu An says:\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Name.\nEmpty yet luminous, tranquil yet profound—without form, without name, yet alive—this is called **True Emptiness**.\nExisting yet without form—this is called **Wondrous Being**.\nTrue Emptiness and Wondrous Being are boundlessly wondrous and profound.\nThose who attain the utmost honor it as the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way originally has no words; through words, it is revealed—this can be spoken of, yet it is not the common Dao/Way. It is the **Wondrous Dao/Way**, the **Great Dao/Way**.\n\n*'Wondrous'* means **encompassing all without exclusion**, penetrating all without omission, acting without action yet universally responsive, without selfishness or origin, yet endlessly wondrous and inexhaustible—without form yet manifesting all forms, without name yet establishing all names.\n\n*'Great'* means **without limit, without surpassing**, the most exalted and noble—it is the mother of **One Qi** and the ancestor of the **Three Powers**.\nThus, it is **Nameless**.\nIt is empty and luminous, without form—thus, it is **Nameless**.\nWhen One Qi moves, clarity and turbidity separate; when the Two Principles are positioned, yin and yang become evident; when the Three Powers are established, all things are born—now it can be named.\nThe Dao/Way that can be named is the **Wondrous Dao/Way**, the **Great Dao/Way**, the **Great Root** of the Three Powers.\n\nWhat is the **Great Root**?\nThe **clear and wondrous qi** is firm—above, it forms the image of **Heaven**.\nThe **wondrous yet turbid qi** is yielding—below, it takes form as **Earth**.\nThose who receive the **pure, true, and harmonious qi of luminous clarity** are **humanity**, where firmness and yielding balance.\nEmpty, luminous, and wondrous, in humans it is called **the Heart**, the sovereign of the body, the king of all things—also called **Nature**, which is **Life**.\n'Nature' is what is called **Heaven’s Command**.\nThe Nameless is the mother of all things.\nWithout form yet supremely empty and luminous, alive yet without sound or color—\nwithin it, One Qi emerges—this is called **the Primordial Origin of Heaven and Earth**.\nFrom this, the Three Powers are established, and the Three Generations give birth to all things—\nthus it is named, the **mother of all things**, and the world is complete.\"*",

The Master was a Sage—\nZigong merely a common scholar.\nProgram Yi-chuan once pointed to a table and asked Shao Kangzhe:\n*\"Where is this table located?\"*\n*\"Where is Heaven and Earth?\"*\nKangzhe expounded its principle to the utmost,\neven beyond the six directions.\nYi-chuan sighed:\n*\"All my life, only Zhou Moshu has spoken thus.\"*\nKangzhe’s son, Bo-wen, recorded it—\nyet only said *\"he expounded to the utmost\"* without detailing what was said,\nso later scholars could never grasp its essence.\nCould this be what ordinary mortals can speak of,\nwhat ordinary mortals can name?\n\nBefore the *Supreme Ultimate* divided,\nbefore *Yin-Yang*’s indistinctness took form,\nno name had yet been established—\nthus it was called *the Nameless*,\nthe beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n*Beginning*—\nspeaking of its first emergence.\n\nOnce names were established,\nYin and Yang had the names *Yin* and *Yang*,\nthe ten thousand things had their respective names—\nthus all transformations and changes arose from this,\nall myriad branches and tendrils sprang from this.\nHence it was called *the Named*,\nthe *Mother of the Ten Thousand Things*.\n*Mother*—\nthat from which all things derive their birth.\nJust as *Kun* is called *Mother*,\nfor it is the source from which all things draw sustenance.\n\n*\"Constantly without, yet constantly with\"*—\nthis is the punctuation.\n\nThe Dao/Way as a thing is still yet dynamic,\nnot to be found in mere *nothingness*—\nfor then its wonder would not be seen;\nnot to be found in mere *somethingness*—\nfor then its periphery would not be glimpsed.\n*Wonder*—\nthe utmost *profound*, the utmost *essential*,\nthe extreme of subtlety.\n*Periphery*—\nthe borderlands, where the Great Dao’s edge meets lesser paths, called *jiao*.\n*Jiao*—\nalso *return*.\nTo *seek*—\nthis is to *aspire*.\n\nThose who study the Dao/Way well\nconstantly, in *timelessness*, pursue the *supreme ultimate*—\nfor they seek to observe its utmost wonder;\nconstantly, in *timeliness*, pursue the *supreme ultimate*—\nfor they seek to observe its peripheral paths.\n\n*Nothingness* and *somethingness* oppose yet arise together,\nsame source, different names—\nboth are called *profound*.\n*Profound*—\nthe extreme of wonder,\nbeyond speech or description,\nnot merely *profound*, but *profound yet more profound*.\n\nSpanning

interpreted this chapter:\n*\"The Dao/Way is originally beyond speech;\nonce speech is applied, all is secondary meaning.\"*\n\n*Constant*—\nunchanging, unalterable.\nWhat can be spoken of, what can be named—\nthis is change, this is alteration;\nwhat cannot be spoken of, what cannot be named—\nthis is no change, no alteration.\nHis reasoning is lofty—\nyet upon close reflection,\nif *\"what can be spoken of\"* is not the *eternal Dao/Way*,\nthen *\"what can be named\"* is not the *eternal Name*—\nthis may conflict with the later phrase *\"the Named, Mother of the Ten Thousand Things.\"*\n\nThe character *Dao* in *\"The Dao/Way\"* is static and weighty;\nthe *Dao/Way* in *\"can be spoken of\"* and *\"constant Dao/Way\"* is dynamic and light—\nthe same for *name*.\nThis chapter opens the *Scripture*—\nLaozi’s grand intent for all who study.\nThose who seek the Dao/Way’s utmost foundation\nmust begin here.\nScholars of the *Scripture* should ponder it deeply.\n\nXu Liu said:\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of—\nthis is not the eternal Dao/Way.\"*\nThe Dao/Way opens to reverence, touching the taboo—\nlike one who does not yet understand\nbut merely hears and draws a snake’s foot.\n\nOriginally, *Hun-Meng* was formless, nameless—\nsince the opening of creation,\nanciently enduring,\nbeyond the grasp of great wisdom,\nbeyond the speech of divine mouths.\nThe Sage knew it in silence,\nyet could not bear for later ages to remain ignorant—\nthus, he named it *Dao/Way* as a metaphor for the formless, the nameless,\nso that it might be

beautiful,\nyet offers no real benefit to the Dao/Way.\nHow could it endure?\n\nThus the *Scripture* says:\n*\"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of—\nthis is not the eternal Dao/Way.\"*\nSince what can

character *Dao* itself\nis but the name for the formless, the nameless.\nIf one does not attain its reality,\nmerely clinging to the *name* that can be named—\nlike the wind, like a sudden rain—\nhow

      "translated_text": "「The *Liezi* states: The dead are the Dao’s return (归). Zhang Huan’s annotation says that *miao* (徼) is return (归), which is correct. Indeed, before there was any single thing, the principles of all phenomena were already complete. When the myriad things dispersed and took on distinct forms, none failed to return to their original source. Thus, those who embody the Dao must always be without desire to observe its subtlety (妙), and thereby preserve their spirit (神) to resonate and connect with all under Heaven. This understanding is already realized in the stillness of unchanging repose.\n\nThey must also have desire to observe its return (徼), and thereby perceive its cycles, as the constant return to the root and the restoration of vital essence (命) are already evident in the ceaseless interplay of all things. Hence, knowing the subtle and the manifest, one reflects on the vast, grasps the essential to govern all things, and thus the Dao resides within them.\n\nThe Dao’s essence and function are one source, with its subtle and manifest aspects inseparable, so it is said: *“These two [subtlety and return] share a common origin but differ in name.”*\n\n*Xuān* (玄) signifies profound and distant meaning. When called *xuān*, it is said that the Sage and the Dao are as one, encompassing both the refined and the coarse, motion and stillness, transcending being and non-being—so that neither being nor non-being can truly name it. Thus, it is entrusted to *xuān*, as if to say: *“Deep and distant, yet no name can suffice.”*\n\nThis is the great and transforming work of the Dao—*xuān* beyond *xuān*—the unknowable essence of the Sage. In its entering and exiting, its coming and going, what is its proper abode yet remains ineffable? Hence, it is called *“the gateway to all subtleties.”*\n\nIn the Buddhist tradition, the *constant* (常) is called *true constant* (真常), and *subtlety* (妙) is called *wondrous being* (妙有). The interplay of constant, non-constant, and being is the meaning of *emptiness-form* (空色).\n\nWhen called *xuān*, it is that which transcends being and non-being.\n\nThe *Collected Remnants* (*Shíyí*) records: Yan Junping said: *“The Named is not the Dao. The Nameless is not the Dao. The Constructed is not the Dao. The Unconstructed is not the Dao. That which is Nameless yet names all things, that which is Unconstructed yet constructs all things—*\nthis is the Dao. The Sage of the Great Peace (太平光师) said: *“When there is opposition, it is duality (客异); when all distinctions are severed, it is the profound unity (玄同). To forget the profound unity itself is to call it *profound-profound* (玄玄).”*\nBing Wen states: *“This chapter illuminates the ultimate essence of the *Double Profound* (重玄), not merely that the Dao which can be spoken of is not the Dao, nor that the Dao which cannot be spoken of is not the Dao. In the *Zhuangzi*, both speech and silence are insufficient to exhaust the Dao. Not only is the Dao always nameless, but even the interplay of named and nameless cannot exhaust the Dao.*\n\n*The Unnamed is the semblance of the Dao. Since both having and non-being cannot exhaust the Dao, it is again entrusted to the *Double Profound* (重玄).”*\n\nThe *Cross-Referencing of the Masters* and *Guan Yinzi* state:\n*“There is no Dao that can be spoken of; what cannot be spoken of is the Dao.\nThere is no Dao that can be thought of; what cannot be thought of is the Dao.\nHeaven’s flow is unrestrained (怒流), human affairs are intricate (错错然)—*\nlike the flickering of shadows (若若乎回), like the clashing of nations (戛戛乎国), like the fleeting of semblances (勿勿乎似而非), yet people debate it, cling to it, reject it, praise it, abandon it, or grasp at it. To speak of it is like chasing after a shadow; to think of it is like probing dust. The Sage’s wisdom creates confusion, and even spirits do not recognize it. Only that which cannot be done, cannot be attained, cannot be measured, and cannot be divided is called Heaven, called Vital Essence (命), called Spirit (神), called Profound (玄), and collectively called the Dao.\n\nThere is not a single thing that is not Heaven, not a single thing that is not Vital Essence (命), not a single thing that is not Spirit (神), not a single thing that is not Profound (玄). If things are such, how can humans be otherwise? Everyone can be called Heaven, everyone can be called Spirit (神), everyone can be said to attain Vital Essence (命) and penetrate the Profound (玄). Yet one cannot say this thing is Heaven and that is not, this is Spirit and that is not, this is Vital Essence and that is not, this is Profound and that is not.\n\nThus, those who excel in the Dao understand that within a single thing, Heaven is complete, Spirit is exhausted, Vital Essence is attained, and the Profound is realized. In studying it, one follows the varied names, analyzing them to find their shared reality. In attaining it, one aligns with the unity, forgetting the varied names.”*\n\nChen Baoyi’s interpretation states:\n*“The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Scholars of the world rarely see the *Guan Yinzi*, yet they often interpret the Dao through the words of a hundred schools and their own conjectures, making them ever more unable to clarify Laozi’s intent.*\n\n*The *Guan Yinzi* says:\nIf there were a Dao that could not be spoken of, then the Dao and speech would be two. Only when what cannot be spoken of is the Dao do speech and the Dao become one. Yet scholars, upon seeing ‘there is no Dao that can be spoken of,’ often mistakenly believe there is a Dao that *can* be spoken of. If there were a Dao that could be spoken of, it should be said ‘there is a Dao that is not unspeakable,’ not ‘there is no Dao that can be spoken of.’\n\nNow, when it is said: ‘There is no Dao that can be spoken of; what cannot be spoken of is the Dao,’ it is reversing Laozi’s words to clarify his deeper meaning. When reversed, it reads: ‘There is no Dao that cannot be spoken of; what cannot be spoken of is the Dao.’ Once it is reversed to say ‘what cannot be spoken of is the Dao,’ then it is reversed again to say ‘the Dao that can be spoken of is not the Dao.’ This is Laozi’s statement that the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\n\nSome still doubt whether ‘can be spoken of’ refers to the Dao of speech. I further reverse the scripture’s words to enlighten them, saying: As when one says ‘emptiness can be emptied, yet it is not true emptiness’—if it can be emptied, then there are things. Where it is blocked yet not emptied, how can it be called true emptiness? Knowing that emptiness can be emptied is not true emptiness, then one knows that the Dao which can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\n\nOthers may illustrate it thus: ‘Like the heart, the heart is like nature (性); nature can all be cultivated through effort.’ If the Dao were something humans could construct, why then cannot the Dao be spoken of as the Dao? Without reversing the meaning beyond words, I would never have been able to clarify Laozi’s scriptural intent in my lifetime.\n\nPeople of the world are also often misled by the word *constant* (常), thinking Laozi speaks of a Dao beyond the constant. Yet Laozi established this word *constant* precisely to prevent such doubt—that my Dao differs from that of others. They do not realize that this is the universal Dao of all under Heaven. Even the Dao named as Dao is the universal name of all under Heaven.\n\nThis Dao penetrates Heaven and Earth, spans the ancient and the present, without a place it does not inhabit. The moment one opens their mouth to speak of it, they are far removed from the Dao. Hence, it is said to be *two* (二).」",

      "translated_text": "The moment one declares this arbitrarily named *name* as a name that can be named, then it is no longer a name. Only because it cannot be named does one use the conventional name to name it arbitrarily—just as one says, \"It is not a name that can be named, yet the inability to name it *is* the name.\"\n\nThus, what cannot be spoken of *is* the Dao; what cannot be named *is* the name. This is Laozi’s meaning: that which can be spoken of is not the constant Dao, and that which can be named is not the constant name.\n\nYet Laozi was a great sage—his words like Heaven’s unspeakable speech. Were it not for a sage like Guan Yinzi, who could have further illuminated the meaning beyond the words through unspeakable speech?\n\nBut Guan Yinzi, having already illuminated the meaning of what cannot be named or spoken, feared that people might think: if the Dao cannot be named or spoken, then it can be attained through thought. Hence, he further said: \"It is not that the Dao cannot be thought, but that which cannot be thought *is* the Dao\"—the same intent as before.\n\nAh! What can be spoken of and thought about are human affairs; what cannot be spoken of or thought about are Heavenly matters. Then how do people and Heaven truly differ in appearance?\n\nOne might say: all people can be called Heaven.\n\nYet can people and Heaven truly be observed as the same?\n\nOne might say: Heaven’s phenomena rage like flowing waters, while human affairs are tangled and chaotic—some resemble each other yet turn away, some clash and contend, some seem alike yet are not. Some contend daily with their minds, some remain aloof without engaging, some scold and shout, some murmur and call, some depart and separate, some seek and unite. Heaven’s phenomena and human affairs differ thus—how can they be observed as the same?\n\nNow if one attempts to grasp the Dao through human speech and thought, it is like blowing at shadows or carving dust—only exhausting the mind in vain.\n\nThis Dao: even sages and wise ones, when crafting it, remain bewildered; even spirits and gods, when probing it, do not recognize it. Only because it cannot be made, it is called *Heaven*; because it cannot be attained, it is called *Fate*; because it cannot be measured, it is called *Spirit*; because it cannot be divided, it is called *Mysterious*.\n\nCombining these four, one arbitrarily names it *Dao*.\n\nLaozi spoke of the Dao, following it with *constant* and *without desire* to observe its subtlety, *constant* and *with desire* to observe its peril—both called *Mysterious*. Mysterious beyond mysterious, the gateway to all subtleties.\n\nGuan Yinzi feared that scholars would cling to differing names, dissecting the same reality, and thus observe Heaven, Fate, Spirit, and the Mysterious as separate. Hence, in this passage, he reiterates: within a single thing, one can know Heaven, exhaust Spirit, attain Fate, and craft the Mysterious.\n\nAll things are thus; all people inherently possess this. It cannot be that this is Heaven and that is not, this is Spirit and that is not, this is Fate and that is not, this is Mysterious and that is not.\n\nThus, some call it *subtle*, some call it *perilous*, some call it *Mysterious*—yet all things are thus, and all people inherently possess it. Only those who grasp it recognize its unity, forgetting its differences, and call it by name.\n\nAs for *Mysterious beyond mysterious*, one may enter the Dao.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"There is a beginning, there is what has no beginning yet has a beginning, there is what has no beginning to what has no beginning yet has a beginning, there is what has existence, there is what has non-existence, there is what has no beginning to non-existence, there is what has no beginning to what has no beginning to non-existence. Suddenly, there is non-existence. Yet who knows whether this non-existence is truly non-existent or truly existent?\"*\n\nNow, I have already spoken of it, yet I do not know whether my words truly have meaning or truly lack meaning.\n\nWith the original as refined, with things as coarse, with accumulation as insufficiency, serene and alone, dwelling with Spirit and Clarity.\n\nIn ancient Daoist arts, there was one such as this. Guan Yinzi and Lao Dan heard of its essence and took delight in it, establishing it with *constant non-being*, governing it with *Great Unity*, using *softness, weakness, humility, and lowliness* as its outward form, and *emptiness, voidness, and non-destruction of all things* as its substance.\n\nWenzi said:\n*\"What gives rise to affairs responds to changes and moves accordingly. Change is governed by time, and its actions are without constancy.\"*\n\nThus, the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao, and the name that can be named is not the constant name.\n\nBooks are born from speech. Speech arises from the wise who do not know—this is the non-constant Dao. What can be named is not the act of preserving books.\n\nIn ancient times, those with unbound hair and no collar ruled under Heaven. Their virtue was born without killing, gave without taking, and all under Heaven, though empty, cherished their virtue.\n\nAt that time, yin and yang were harmonious, and all things flourished. Birds’ nests could be reached by leaning down, and wild beasts could be tethered and followed.\n\nWhen it declined, birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became human hazards. Thus, iron was cast and blades were forged to defend against them.\n\nWhen people were pressed by these hazards, they sought convenience; when plagued by troubles, they prepared defenses. Each used their wisdom to avoid what harmed them and pursue what benefited them.\n\nSince constancy cannot be followed, and tools cannot be relied upon, the laws of the ancient kings had variations.\n\nThus, it is said: what can be named is not the constant name.\n\nThe Five Constants differ in Dao yet cover all under Heaven; the Three Kings varied in affairs yet their names endure in posterity.\n\nThey adapted to the times and changed accordingly.\n\nFor instance, the music master’s tuning of the five tones shifts up and down without fixed measurements, yet never misses the mark.\n\nThus, those attuned to the emotions of music can compose sounds with roots, centered in harmony. Those who understand the uses of compasses, squares, hooks, and cords can govern people. Hence, the ancient kings’ distinctions, though not rigidly enforced, were followed in the later ages. Thus, sages established rites and music without being bound by law.\n\nHence, it is said: the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\n\nTo alleviate poverty and relieve urgency brings forth names of profit and harm, removes accumulated ills, and achieves success. When the world has no disasters, even sages have no virtue to apply, and when all are harmonious, even the virtuous have no deeds to establish.\n\nThus, the governance of the perfected sage embraces virtue, holds to the Dao, extends sincerity, and applies boundless wisdom—resting in speechlessness, unknown to the world. Their speechlessness is honored, hence the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao, and the name that can be named is not the constant name.",

Would Laozi name his work *\"Dao\"* only to immediately speak of the world’s Dao?\n\nIf instead the first *\"Dao\"* is Laozi’s own Dao—meaning *\"My Dao is not the Dao of the common people\"*—this also holds some plausibility. Yet then *\"the constant Dao\"* would refer to the Dao of the common people, as in Confucius An Guo’s *\"Book Sequence\"* where *\"the constant Dao\"* is mentioned.\n\nBut the next chapter speaks of *\"knowing the constant as clarity,\"* and this chapter itself contains *\"constantly without desire to observe its subtlety, constantly with desire to observe its peril.\"* Would *\"constant\"* here mean merely the ordinary?\n\nBoth interpretations seem flawed. After careful reconsideration, it appears that both the opening *\"Dao\"* and the subsequent *\"constant Dao\"* refer to the essence of the Dao itself. The *\"Dao that can be spoken of\"* is the Dao as commonly understood by people. If one says, *\"My Dao is not the Dao that can be pointed to by the world,\"* then the Dao that can be named is not the Dao of natural constancy that I speak of.\n\nThe *\"constant\"* refers to that which is ever-present in all things, unchanging through time, eternally enduring from antiquity to the present. The Dao as commonly spoken of—what Confucius called *\"the lesser Dao\"* and Mencius *\"the divided Dao\"*—is the Dao of daily practice and common conduct. But Laozi’s Dao is the singular, void, and natural principle itself.\n\n*\"The name that can be named is not the constant name.\"* This passage also has two interpretations.\n\nSome take the opening *\"name\"* as the name of the common world, while others take it as the name of the Dao. The distinction in meaning mirrors that of the previous passage.\n\nFollowing the earlier pattern, the opening *\"name\"* and the subsequent *\"constant name\"* both refer to the naming of the Dao. The Dao itself cannot truly be named, yet we designate it as *\"Dao\"* by force of convention. If it could be named, then its names would be relative—such as the *\"beautiful and ugly, difficult and easy, long and short, high and low\"* mentioned in the next chapter—which cannot be considered the *\"constant name.\"* Thus, these two sentences serve only to elucidate the previous two, explaining the later chapter’s assertion that the Dao is forcibly named.\n\n*\"Nameless, the origin of heaven and earth. Named, the mother of ten thousand things.\"* This passage also has two interpretations.\n\nSome punctuate it as *\"Nameless, named,\"* while others as *\"Without, with.\"* The latter seems more elevated. Yet the next chapter speaks of *\"the Dao constantly without name at its origin, then named in its manifestation,\"* so perhaps this too could be punctuated thus.\n\nThose who punctuate *\"Nameless, named\"* are correct. The essence of the Great Dao is boundless and formless, yet all phenomena are already manifest within it. Because it is boundless and formless, it cannot be named, hence *\"Nameless.\"* Though nameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth. Because all phenomena are already present, their principles can be named, hence *\"Named.\"* Once named, it becomes the mother of all things.\n\n*\"Origin\"* refers to its source—being generated from the void, hence *\"origin.\"* *\"Mother\"* refers to its latent presence, like an embryo already formed, hence *\"mother.\"* This *\"origin\"* is akin to the *\"Great Origin\"* in the *Yijing*, and *\"mother\"* is akin to the *\"completion of things.\"* But the *Yijing* speaks primarily of Heaven and Earth, while this text focuses solely on the Dao.\n\n*\"Constantly without desire, one observes its subtlety; constantly with desire, one observes its peril.\"* This passage also has two interpretations.\n\nSome punctuate it at *\"without\"* and *\"with,\"* following Zhuangzi. Indeed, the *\"Heaven and Earth\"* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* speaks of *\"establishing it with constant non-being,\"* directly echoing this passage’s *\"constant without, constant with.\"* Yet the later chapter of the *Laozi* itself contains the phrase *\"constant without desire,\"* making it unlikely to punctuate at *\"without.\"*\n\nPunctuating at *\"desire\"* conflicts with the *Zhuangzi*, while punctuating at *\"without\"* conflicts with the later chapter. Yet the *Zhuangzi* most faithfully captures the *Laozi’s* essence—could the *\"without desire\"* in the later chapter be a mere coincidence, not to be taken as precedent?\n\nSince both interpretations have merit, neither should be discarded. Punctuating at *\"without\"* and *\"with\"* speaks to the nature of the Dao itself; speaking of *\"constant without desire\"* and *\"constant with desire\"* addresses how humanity embodies the Dao.\n\nThe constant Dao is hidden in the void, hence its subtlety can be observed there; the constant Dao manifests in the having, hence its perils can be observed there.",

Know\" (天下皆知章)**\n\n**Variant Readings:**\n- *Héshànggōng* composed *The Chapter on Nourishing the Body* (《养身章》),\n- Zhào Shí’ān composed *The Chapter on the True and Eternal Integration of Principles* (《真常融摄义章》).\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**\nThe preceding chapter illuminated the wondrous origin of transformation,\ndistinguishing the twofold observation [of Dao].\nThis chapter elucidates the undifferentiated and scattered names of *Pu* (the Uncarved),\narising from myriad distinctions—\nas distinctions arise, so does wandering,\nbut virtuous transformation returns to the root.\n\nThus, it first marks the entanglement of beauty, goodness, and delusion,\nthen demonstrates the interplay of presence and absence,\nand concludes with the Sage’s principle,\nhoping to swiftly restore the pure and unadulterated.\n\n**Dù Guāngtíng’s Explanation:**\nThe vast and boundless currents of existence,\nthe sluggish multitude of living beings—\nentering realms, emotions stir;\nthe farther from the Dao, the more distant they stray.\nThe Sage pities their forgetfulness and opens this wondrous gate.\n\nThe twofold observation of the previous chapter\nentered from non-being into being.\nThis chapter marks the sixfold delusions,\nwhereby affairs sway the mind.\nIf one knows the error of following realms\nand does not succumb to wandering transformations,\nthen one may speak of the gradual cultivation of an empty heart and full belly.\n\n**Zhāng Chōngyìng’s Interpretation:**\nThe Dao precedes the body yet encompasses heaven and earth.\nIf one aligns with this natural Dao in action,\nthe spirit is preserved, the essence fortified—\ndo not chase after things,\ndo not flaunt one’s talents,\ndo not crave fame;\nfear gain as one seeks loss,\napproach the near while dreading the far—\nthen all calamities fade unseen,\nand the body finds its nourishment.\nThus, *Nourishing the Body* follows the chapter on embodying the Dao—\nthis is *Héshànggōng*’s exposition.\n\n---\n**All under heaven know beauty as beauty—**\nthen ugliness arises.\nAll under heaven know goodness as goodness—\nthen wickedness arises.\nThus, presence and absence give rise to

other.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in non-action,\nteaches without speech—\nall things arise yet he does not claim them,\ngives birth yet does not possess,\nacts yet does not rely upon it,\nand when

with *\"Thus it does not abide\"* (不处).\n\n**Héshànggōng’s Explanation:**\nAll under heaven know beauty as beauty—\nthis is to boast of one’s own excellence.\nThen ugliness arises—\nthere is peril and

other—\nseeing presence as absence.\nDifficulty and ease complete each other—\nseeing difficulty as ease.\nLength and shortness define each other—\nseeing shortness as length.\nHigh and low contrast each other—\nseeing height as low.\nSounds harmonize—\nwhen one sings, the other must respond.\nBefore and after follow—\nwhen one advances, the other must incline.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in non-action—\ngoverning through the Dao.\nTeaches without speech—\nleading by personal example.\nAll things arise—\neach moves spontaneously.\nYet he does not refuse—\nhe does not reject or obstruct.\nGives birth yet does not possess—\nthe Original Qi generates all things yet does not claim them.\nActs yet does not rely upon it—\nthe Dao’s work is done without expectation of reward.\nWhen the deed is complete, he does not dwell upon it—\nwhen the work is done, he withdraws, not claiming the position.\n**Only by not dwelling does it not depart—**\nonly by not claiming the deed does the blessing remain,\nand it does not abandon the body.\n\nThis shows that what is not done cannot be followed,\nand what is not spoken cannot be known.\n\nThe first six lines speak of high and low, long and short—\nthe Sage opens one source,\nfrom which a hundred branches arise.\nThe transformations of these branches\nare without fail in motion and disorder.\n\n**Wáng Fǔsì’s Commentary:**\nAll under heaven know beauty as beauty—\nbeauty is what the heart delights in.\nUgliness is what the heart abhors.\nBeauty and ugliness are like joy and anger,\ngoodness and wickedness are like right and wrong—\njoy and anger share the same root,\nright and wrong share the same gate.\nThus, they cannot be partially discarded.\n\nThese six are all natural, self-evident truths—\ntherefore, the Sage’s affairs are complete in their naturalness;\nif forced, they fail.\nFrom *\"teaches without speech\"* to *\"does not rely upon it\"*—\nwisdom is inherently complete;\nif forced, it becomes false.\n*\"When the deed is complete, he does not dwell upon it\"*—\nacting in accordance with things,\nthe deed completes itself;\nthus, he does not dwell upon it.\n**Only by not dwelling does it not depart—**\nif the deed is attributed to oneself,\nthe deed cannot endure.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**\nAll under heaven know beauty as beauty—\nbeauty and goodness arise

putrid decay\"*—this is precisely it.\nThus, the arising of being and non-being is relative.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of being and non-being’s inherent nature.\nNon-being does not exist inherently—it arises from being.\nThe common folk thus assert that being generates non-being.\nBeing does not exist inherently—it arises from non-being.\nThe common folk thus assert that non-being generates being.\nHence, it is said *\"they arise in relation\"*—\nthough being and non-being are not inherently dependent,\nthe names of *\"relative generation\"* stem from deluded perception,\njust as beauty and ugliness are not inherently produced—\nall are empty.\nThus, the Sage seeks to investigate this deluded entanglement,\nand so proceeds to enumerate the sixfold illusions:\nDifficulty and ease arise in relation.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of difficulty and ease’s inherent nature.\nBecause of difficulty, ease arises;\nbecause of ease, difficulty arises.\nIt is like the artisan who finds his craft easy in shaping but difficult in firing,\nor the potter who finds his kiln easy to manage but wood difficult to work.\nHence, it is said *\"difficulty and ease arise in relation.\"*\nIf one aligns with what is difficult, then ease does not exist;\nif one aligns with what is easy, then difficulty does not exist.\nDifficulty and ease are without substance—\ntheir names arise from false perception.\nThus, those who comprehend them abandon both skill and clumsiness,\nand the names of difficulty and ease cease.\nSimilarly, beauty and ugliness are without fixed nature.\n\nLength and shortness arise in contrast.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of length and shortness’s inherent nature.\nBecause of length, shortness appears;\nbecause of shortness, length appears—\nhence *\"length and shortness arise in contrast.\"*\nThe duck’s legs are not short,\nyet when compared to the crane’s length, they seem so—\nthus, to extend them causes sorrow.\nThe crane’s legs are not long,\nyet when compared to the duck’s shortness, they seem so—\nthus, to shorten them causes grief.\nSeeing length and shortness arise in contrast,\nit is like beauty and ugliness—\nwithout fixed substance,\nall are falsely perceived.\nSince their forms are empty, their names are also empty—\nhence, they are left undefined.\n\nHigh and low arise in mutual dependence.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of the names *\"high\"* and *\"low.\"*\nThe names *\"high\"* and *\"low\"* mutually depend,\nhence one speaks of *\"high\"* only in relation to *\"low,\"*\nand one speaks of *\"low\"* only in relation to *\"high.\"*\nAgain, when one deems something *\"high,\"*\nit is not truly high—\nwhen one deems something *\"low,\"*\nit is not truly low.\nLike the ministers and subjects of past dynasties,\nwho constantly shift in status,\nthese names are also without fixed nature—\nhence, no fixed position.\n\nSounds and voices arise in harmony.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of *\"harmony\"* and *\"union.\"*\nWhen the five tones harmonize to form a melody,\nwho unifies all the voices?\nThen one can measure the song—\nas with the laws of past dynasties,\nall harmonize and unite,\nyet their essence is not truly real—\nall are empty.\nThus, when the Sage seeks to establish beauty and ugliness,\nhow could he speak of such profound observation?\n\nPast and future arise in succession.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThis elucidates the emptiness of the three times.\nDay and night succeed each other—\nthe new arises from the old.\nWho, when casting a footstep, determines *\"past\"* and *\"future\"*?\nThe names *\"past\"* and *\"future\"* arise from their succession.\nSince names arise from false perception,\nand one deceives oneself in recognizing their essence,\nthe three times—past, present, and future—are empty.\nThus, they constantly change and transform,\njust as beauty and ugliness have no fixed names.\n\nThe six arise in opposition,\nsequentially generating names—\njust as beauty and ugliness,\nwhich are not inherently produced,\nstem from deluded emotions,\nleading to such manifold confusions.\nThus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching.\n\n*\"Non-action\"*—\nthis is the teaching of non-action.\nIt is metaphorically called *\"action\"*—\nhence, *\"abiding in the teaching of non-speech\"*—\nthis is the forgetting of speech.\nIt is metaphorically called *\"teaching\"*—\nhence, *\"practicing\"*—\n\n**Commentary:**\n*\"Thus\"*—\nthis explains the lower to clarify the upper.\nThough the adorned and deceitful may remain silent,\nthey are not practicing non-action;\nthough the natural and simple may give constant orders,\nthey remain unperturbed.\nThus, the Sage knows all dharmas are of empty nature—\nwithout arrogance or attachment,\none governs the world by rejecting pretenses,\nemploying pure virtue.\nThe people transform accordingly,\neach content in their allotted place.\nContentment in one’s place brings no disturbance—\nis this not the matter of non-action?\nWords issue from oneself,\nall based on the world’s hearts—\nthus, though speaking all day, one has never truly spoken—\nis this not the teaching of non-speech?\nAll things act naturally without complaint.\nThe Sage allows all things to follow their own movements,\nyet they do not thank or reproach the Sage.\n\n**Commentary:**\n*\"Act\"* means movement—\n*\"complaint\"* means gratitude or reproach.\nThe Sage’s good governance is without action or effort,\nyet the people, unaware, rejoice and are content,\neach following their own movements,\nwithout thanking or reproaching the Sage.\nThus, they strike the earth and drum their bellies,\nforgetting the Emperor’s power—\nthe people forget the Sage’s deeds.\n\n*\"To give birth without possession,\nto act without dwelling\"*—\nallowing things to fulfill their nature,\nnot claiming them as one’s own,\neach attaining their proper course without neglecting caution.\nThus, the great peace’s function is achieved.\nIt is still necessary to be cautious each day as one was at the beginning—\nnot daring to rest complacently.\n\n**Commentary:**\nNow, all things attain fulfillment in their natural course,\nyet the Sage does not possess them.\nThe Sage allows all things to follow their own cultivation,\nyet does not rely upon them as his own merit.\nThus, the great peace’s function is ever more expansive and distant,\nyet it is still fitting to remain cautious as at the outset—\nnot daring to rest complacently—\nthis is the Sage’s self-forgetting of his merit.\n*\"It is still necessary to be cautious each day as one was at the beginning\"*—\nthis is the wording of the *Shan Shu*.\nThe Sage who does not dwell in merit,\nthus does not lose it.\nThe Sage who does not dare rest complacently,\nyet constantly refines his virtue,\nforgets his merit while it remains—\nthus, he does not dwell in it and yet does not lose it.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe Sage is upright like a hair,\ncautious to the end as at the beginning,\nhis beginning and end never decaying.\nHe never rests complacently or indulges in ease,\nthus daily renewing his great virtue,\nforgetting his merit while it remains,\nilluminating his dwelling as the world finds peace.\nHence, it is said: *\"The Sage who does not dwell in merit, thus does not lose it.\"*\nDu Guangting states:\n*\"All under heaven know beauty as beauty,\nyet this does not make them virtuous.\"*\nUnder heaven, those who know the Dao are few,\nthe common are many.\nThose who cultivate their bodies are few,\nthose who follow material desires are many.\nAll know beauty and virtue as correct,\nyet few can practice them;\nall know ugliness and evil as incorrect,\nyet few can abandon them.\nThus, the Sage laments them—\nhence *\"ugliness has already arisen,\"*\n*\"evil has already arisen.\"*",

intersect,\nwhere myriad thoughts arise,\nwhere divergent paths begin—\nare the snares by which the world is ensnared, unable to escape.\n\nWithout motion, there is *having*;\n*having* returns to *non-having*—\nthus, the interplay of *having* and *non-having*.\nWhere there is peril in crossing,\none knows the ease of traversing—\nthus, the interplay of difficulty and ease,\nof length and shortness—\nas with inches and spans.\nHigh and low take form in contrast—\nas with mountains and marshes.\nSound rises, echo responds—\nthus, the harmony of sound and voice.\nForm moves, shadow follows—\nthus, the succession of before and after.\n\nThe movement of yin and yang,\nthe progression of the four seasons,\nthe principles of all things—\nsuddenly formed, then suddenly vanished.\nIts difficulty is like deliberate action governing the world;\nits ease is like effortless alignment with nature.\n\nWhat is long is not to be severed,\nwhat is short is not to be extended—\nheaven naturally ascends, earth naturally descends.\nStrike the *gōng* and the *gōng* resonates;\nstrike the *jué* and the *jué* responds.\nSpring comes first, summer follows;\nthe elder precedes, the younger follows.\n\nThough these paired realms all rest within the Dao,\nthey are far from the Dao itself.\n\nThus, the Sage’s supreme teaching:\nto act in *wuwei*, as *Zhuangzi* said—\n*\"to govern

claim no transformation,\nto encompass heaven and earth, to carve all forms yet claim no craft—\nthus, *\"to act yet not rely.\"*\n\nThe seasons turn, and the effective departs—\nthis is the Way of

*having* and *non-having* unfolds,\nforever preceding and following.\n\n*Having* and *non-having*,\ndifficulty and ease,\nlength and shortness,\nhigh and low,\nsound and voice,\nbefore and after—\nall inevitably have their opposites.\nOnly by transcending these six pairs\ncan one enter the divine—\nand entering the divine, one stands without opposition between heaven and earth.\n\n*The Zìshuō* says:\n*\"Wu* from *dà*, *lín* from *wáng*—\nthe ultimate of *having* is to return to *non-having*.*\nLaozi said:\n*\"The interplay of having and non-having.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage’s supreme teaching:\nThe Sage, observing that *having* has opposites,\ntherefore acts in *wuwei* and teaches without speech.\nThe Sage never fails to act—\nyet action arises from *wuwei*.\nThe Sage never fails to speak—\nyet speech arises from *non-speech*.\n\nFrom *\"giving birth yet not possessing\"* to *\"achieving success yet not dwelling\"*—\nto give birth yet not claim its birth,\nto act yet not rely on the act,\nto achieve success yet not dwell upon it—\nthese three arise from *wu-wǒ* (no-self).\n\nOnly by *wu-wǒ* does one not lose oneself.\nNot only does one not lose oneself,\nbut one also does not lose others.\nTo fail to know *wu-wǒ* and instead dwell in *yǒu-wǒ* (self),\nis not only to lose oneself—\nbut also to lose others.\n\nTo dwell upon success is to invite departure;\ndwelling and departure are opposites.\nThe Sage’s three non-dwellings—\nonly then does the Dao abide within oneself,\nand not depart.\n\nSu Yán said:\n*\"When all know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises.\"*\nThe world judges beauty and ugliness by form and name.\nWhat they call beautiful and good—\nis it truly beautiful and good?\nThey do not know the interplay of *having* and *non-having*,\ndifficulty and ease, length and shortness, high and low,\nsound and voice, before and after—\nall these are not their true nature.\n\nJust as one assumes length, yet a longer one surpasses—\nthen one is short.\nJust as one assumes precedence, yet a prior one comes—\nthen one is last.\nIf one follows what is deemed beautiful and believes it,\none strays far from the truth.\n\nThus, the Sage’s supreme teaching:\nWhen acting, hold the heart of *wuwei*;\nwhen teaching, hold the intent of *non-speech*—\nthus, transcending measures of length and shortness,\nfree from ranks of before and after,\nneither beautiful nor ugly,\nneither good nor ungood—\nhow could the world ever comprehend?\n\nFrom *\"all things arise\"* to *\"not dwelling\"*—\nall things act for me, yet I decline none;\nI give birth to them, yet never claim or rely—\neven in success, I never dwell upon it—\nthis is the teaching of *wuwei* and *non-speech*,\nits beauty and goodness beyond measure.",

      "translated_text": "Is this not like beauty being called beauty, goodness being called good—\nyet their nature remains undetermined?\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"The right may become the strange,\nthe good may become the ominous.\"*\nThis is indeed so.\n\nMoreover, the principles of all under heaven:\nWhere there is action, there is gain and loss;\nwhere there is speech, there is right and error—\nnone are free from entanglement.\n\nThus, the Sage engages in *wuwei* (non-action),\nconducts *buyan* (non-teaching).\nThrough this, he transcends things and people,\nstanding alone above all things,\nnot opposing things—\nand thus nothing can pair with him.\nThis is what *Liezi* called *\"doubtful solitude,\"*\nwhat *Zhuangzi* called *\"the singular possession.\"*\n\nIn *wuwei*, the utmost is to abandon action,\nyet in the silent depths, clarity is alone revealed;\nin *buyan*, the utmost is to abandon speech,\nyet in the soundless void, harmony is alone heard.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao within himself—\nhis mind labors not,\nhis response to things is without measure.\nAll things come to him endlessly, never exhausted,\nso when all things act in concert,\nresponding as they are sensed,\nhe acts with them without reluctance,\nallows all things to generate themselves without claiming their generation,\nallows all things to be themselves without relying on their being.\nHis achievements cover all under heaven,\nyet it seems not his own doing;\nhis transformation benefits all things,\nyet the people do not depend on him.\n\nThus, when achievements are complete, he does not dwell upon them—\nif he dwells, then he must depart.\nTherefore, only by not dwelling does he not depart.\nWhen achievements are complete yet he does not claim them,\nis this not because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous?\nThus, he follows this with *\"not extolling the virtuous.\"*\n\nZhao Shiyuan remarked:\n*\"The opening sequence explains the six pairs.*\n*First, it declares the non-essential nature of the right.*\n*When all under heaven know this, they recognize that evil has already arisen.*\n\n*The Dao De Jing’s discourse on virtue and power*\n*is most profound in its opening chapter.*\n*From the ever-non-existent to the ever-existent,*\n*within the vague and indistinct, form emerges,*\n*unifying all things in one thread.*\n*Again, from the mysterious to the yet more mysterious,*\n*the meaning of gradual and sudden transformation is fully exhausted here.*\n\n*Yet the eighty-one chapters’ principles are interconnected,*\n*their meanings all having their threads.*\n*Once things depart from the subtle gate,*\n*the ever-Dao and ever-name merge*\n*in the realm of beauty and evil.*\n*Thus, it follows with the passage:*\n*'When all under heaven know...'*\n\n*The Dao descending as things,*\n*the ever-present is the body of the Dao.*\n*The body is what fulfills all uses—*\n*how could its use remain fixed in the ever-present?*\n*Thus, following the nature of things, there must be change,*\n*and within things, there must be variation.*\n*The ever-present cannot remain ever-present,*\n*beauty cannot remain ever-beautiful—*\n*as emotions shift and do not align,*\n*good and evil become opposites.*\n\n*The *Shijing* says:*\n*'The gentle autumn wind blows,\nbringing shade and rain.\nPlucking *bo* and *fei*,*\n*do not harm their roots.'*\n*It speaks of how*\n*the emotions of heaven and earth cannot always be harmonious,*\n*the natures of all things cannot always be good.*\n\n*Beauty and evil are neither the Dao nor nature—*\n*they arise from established perceptions.*\n*All established perceptions stem from desire;*\n*the heart of desire knows only that beauty is beauty,*\n*yet does not know that beauty may reverse into evil,*\n*that goodness may reverse into non-goodness.*\n\n*This is how the ever-Dao and ever-name*\n*flow into affairs—*\n*thus, it is said: \"Affairs follow the Dao.\"*\n\n*From this chapter,*\n*beginning with the reversal of good and evil,*\n*to the six pairs not being uniform,*\n*first citing affairs to reveal principles,*\n*then abandoning entanglements to return to truth.*\n\n*The saying \"revealing principles through affairs\"*\n*refers to how the six pairs—*\n*beauty, evil, goodness, non-goodness—*\n*not being uniform are all matters of affairs.*\n*When the Sage engages in *wuwei*,*\n*he perceives principles through affairs,*\n*enters awareness through dust—*\n*who but the Sage could grasp this principle?*\n\n*The Sage, with singular insight, illuminates all,*\n*transcending all forms above,*\n*leaving the realm of flux,*\n*dwelling in the domain of *wuwei*.*\n*What things of all under heaven could entangle him?*\n*This is abandoning entanglements to return to truth.*\n\n*If there is nothing, then there is *wuwei*—*\n*only *wuwei* exists.*\n*If there is something, then affairs arise,*\n*affairs arise from the something.*\n*The Sage would not fearfully establish himself*\n*in the realm of non-affairs.*\n*He simply adapts to changes and governs accordingly.*\n\n*At this point in the text, the discussion shifts to governance.*\n*All discourse on governance*\n*must encompass internal teachings,*\n*then clarify the principles of governance.*\n*Thus, though Confucian scholars may criticize*\n*\"Nashisutong\"* (the room’s teachings),\n*it belongs uniquely to the Sage.*\n*The text first displays the affairs of beauty and evil,*\n*then cites the six pairs to clarify their causes.*\n\n*Second, the realm of opposition.*\n*Thus, the non-existent and existent generate each other,*\n*difficulty and ease complete each other.*\n*The word *zhe* (this) echoes the earlier text,*\n*after lamenting the reversals of beauty, evil, goodness, and non-goodness,*\n*it now marks the six as opposites in the logic of non-existence and existence.*\n\n*Difficulty and ease are matters of affairs,*\n*long and short are matters of talent,*\n*high and low are matters of position,*\n*sounds are matters of pitch and harmony,*\n*before and after are matters of new and old.*\n\n*All things emerge from the mechanism and return to the mechanism,*\n*a hundred transformations arise from soil and return to soil.*\n*Emerging from the mechanism and returning to it—*\n*from the ultimate non-existent, they receive their mandate,*\n*and when they return, they return to the non-existent.*\n*This is speaking of nature.*\n\n*A hundred transformations arise from soil,*\n*from the formed to the formless,*\n*born of things, yet transforming back into soil—*\n*they never depart from the existent.*\n*This is speaking of form.*\n\n*Truly, the existent and non-existent share the same origin in the Dao’s nature—*\n*emerging, they become existent;*\n*returning, they become non-existent.*\n*Just as spring and summer come first,*\n*autumn and winter follow—*\n*beginning and ending complete each other,*\n*alternately hidden, alternately revealed,*\n*the primary meaning within the realm of opposition.*\n\n*Thus, it is said:*\n*\"The non-existent and existent generate each other—*\n*this is principle.*\n*Difficulty and ease complete each other—*\n*affairs have no ease; accumulated difficulty becomes ease.*\n*Affairs have no difficulty; accumulated ease becomes difficulty.*\n\n*Founding a venture is difficult,*\n*preserving it is easy.*\n*Comparing founding to preserving,*\n*though founding is difficult,*\n*its reversal becomes easy—*\n*how is this made clear?*\n*By the righteous overthrowing the

clear?*\n*By the righteous overthrowing the unrighteous,*\n*as the hungry are easily fed,*\n*the thirsty are easily quenched—*\n*like Tang and Wu consoling the people and punishing crimes.\"*\n\nNow, comparing preserving to founding,\npreserving is easy,\nyet its reversal becomes difficult—\nhow is this made clear?\nA ruler who preserves like one holding a full vessel\nmust keep his heart settled and his will balanced,\nlest he not remain still and composed—\nmovement brings collapse.\nThis is called failing to settle the heart and balance the will,\nand thus it becomes difficult.\n\nTherefore, no ruler who preserves compares to King Cheng.\nIf knowledge is easy, there is affection;\nif obedience is easy, there is merit.\nThough only ease is spoken of and not difficulty,\nthose who can achieve ease hold difficulty within.\nThe world’s affairs—who does not follow this?\nTo make difficult what is easy brings ease,\nto make easy what is difficult brings difficulty.\nThus it is said: *\"Difficulty and ease complete each other.\"*\n\nThis matter also concerns\nthe contrast of long and short.\nAll things born between heaven and earth\nshare the same vital *qi*.\nThose who receive the fullness of *qi* grow long,\nthose who receive its weakness grow short.\nThus ancient people often reached seven *chi* in height,\nwhile today’s people rarely exceed five.\nAncient people were tall and majestic—\nthe full descent of *qi*;\ntoday’s people are short and frail—\nthe gradual weakening of *qi*.\nIs this merely the change of affairs?\nHumans are the same.\nThough some vary, none can remain entirely pure.\nThus, the forms of heaven and humanity have fixed measures,\nand their contrasts serve appropriate uses.\nMaterials fit the hands of a master craftsman,\neach suited to its purpose;\ntalents are placed under the selection of the Sage,\neach fulfilling its virtue.\n\nWhat is naturally long cannot be shortened—\nthe crane’s legs are proof;\nwhat is naturally short cannot be extended—\nthe duck’s legs are proof.\nThus, the long cannot be shortened—\nto do so brings sorrow;\nthe short cannot be lengthened—\nto do so brings worry.\nThis is the natural order.\nYet in human nature, there is neither long nor short—\nonly equality.\nBut in the things of humanity,\nthey are certainly not uniform.\nThe *Transmission* says: *\"The tortoise is longer than the snake,\"*\nnot speaking of form but of principle.\n*\"Yin is deficient to yang,\"*\nnot speaking of *qi* but of virtue.\nThere are those like the bones of the *Fangfeng* people,\nwho could span a chariot,\nand the people of *Xingyuan*, who were only a *chi* and a half tall—\nhow unequal they are!\nThough an inch is short and a *chi* is long,\nwithout the inch, the *chi* cannot be complete;\nthough a beam is tall and a rafter is short,\nwithout the rafter, the beam cannot stand firm.\nThis is the meaning of contrast—\nthis is certainly speaking of materials.\n\nThe contrast of high and low:\nHeaven is high, earth is low,\nyang ascends, yin descends,\nmountains rise, marshes sink—\nhigh and low are matters of position and force.\nThe higher the position, the higher the force must be;\nthe lower the position, the lower the force must be.\nYet heaven covers below, earth supports above—\nthe two do not topple each other.\nYang is above, yin is below—\nthe two do not topple each other.\nOnly mountains rising and marshes sinking create a contrast—\nmountains rise, marshes sink,\nand if we speak of water, we say:\n*\"A hundred valleys are the source of rivers and streams,\"*\nthen high things descend to the low.\nIf we take this as true,\nthen rivers and streams are the gathering of the valleys.\nAgain, speaking of the contrast of forces,\nhigh banks become valleys,\ndeep valleys become hills—\nthis is the principle of contrast.\nHow so?\nBanks are high.\nWhen banks are hollowed, they become valleys;\nvalleys are depressions.\nDepressions sink and then level out,\nlevel ground rises and becomes hills.\nWho knows that after a thousand years,\nhills will not become banks,\nor banks will not become depressions?\nContrast is always a matter of force.\n\nThe harmony of sounds—this is music.\nRitual guides the mind,\nmusic guides harmony.\nAfter the simplicity of antiquity dispersed,\npeople lost their natural emotions.\nWithout ritual to regulate them, they become disordered;\nwithout music to harmonize them, they are injured.\nThus, the rise of music is the creation of sounds.\nThe *Record of Music* says:\n*\"All sounds arise from the human heart.\nThe heart’s movement is caused by things.\nWhen moved by things, it manifests in sound.\nSounds respond to each other and thus create variation;\nwhen variation is complete, it is called music.\nComparing sounds to create music,\nand using drums, spears, feathers, and flags—this is music.\nMusic is the origin of sound,\nits root in the heart’s response to things.\nThus, when the sorrowful heart is moved,\nits sound is sharp and severe;\nwhen the joyful heart is moved,\nits sound is slow and relaxed;\nwhen the joyful heart is moved,\nits sound bursts forth and scatters;\nwhen the angry heart is moved,\nits sound is coarse and fierce;\nwhen the respectful heart is moved,\nits sound is straight and restrained;\nwhen the worried heart is moved,\nits sound is harmonious and gentle.\nThese six are not innate;\nthey arise only when moved by things.\nThus, the ancient kings were cautious about what moved them,\nso they used ritual to guide their wills,\nmusic to harmonize their sounds,\ngovernment to unify their actions,\nand law to prevent their deceit.\nRitual, music, law, and governance—\nthese are one in purpose.\nThey serve to unify the people’s hearts\nand establish the path of governance.\n\nAll sounds arise from the human heart.\nEmotions move within,\nand thus manifest in sound.\nWhen sound forms patterns, it is called music.\nThus, in a well-ordered age, music is peaceful and joyful,\nand its governance is harmonious.\nIn a chaotic age, music is resentful and angry,\nand its governance is misaligned.\nIn a fallen kingdom, music is sorrowful and reflective,\nand its people are suffering.\nThe way of sound is linked to governance.\n\n*Gong* is the ruler,\n*Shang* is the minister,\n*Jiao* is the people,\n*Zheng* is affairs,\n*Yu* is things.\nIf these five are not disordered,\nthere will be no discordant sounds.\nThe *Lü* and *Yu* correspond to the twelve months.\nThe five tones arise from the five phases,\nthe five phases correspond to the five viscera.\nThe liver governs anger,\nthe lungs govern sorrow,\nthe spleen governs thought,\nthe heart governs joy,\nthe kidneys govern fear.\nSince the five viscera govern differently,\nthe five tones, when resonating, also differ.\nTo summon joy with joy,\nits sound is also joyful.\nTo summon sorrow with sorrow,\nits sound is also sorrowful.\nInner responses meet outer echoes—\nthis is the harmony of emotions and sounds.",

return to former presents—\ntime transmits it.\n\nTurning back to view it,\nancient and present stand revealed.\nSpring and summer precede autumn and winter—\nthe four seasons flow without pause,\nnew replacing old, old returning as new,\ncycling endlessly, past and future chasing,\nfortune and calamity leaning upon each other without error,\nform and shadow consoling each other without separation.\nThis is the principle of past and future,\nspoken of in terms of new and old.\n\nObserve how existence and nonexistence generate each other—\nthe transformation of things.\nIf identical, it is emptiness;\nemptiness, then, is vast—\nwhat more is there to appear or vanish?\n\nDifficulty and ease complement each other.\nTo grasp and fill is not as good as leaving it be—\nwhat more is there to fear or grieve?\n\nLength and shortness define each other.\nTheir forms are not uniform—\nthe formless cannot be exhausted by numbers.\nWhich is uniform, which is not?\n\nHigh and low incline toward each other.\nThe exalted is *Huang*, the lowly is *Wang*—\nboth attain the Dao’s place,\none and undivided—\nno thing can displace it.\nWhich inclines, which does not?\n\nFor the harmony of sounds and tones,\nis it not like the great sound that lacks voice,\nwhich hearing cannot penetrate?\nFor the past and future following one another,\nis it not like resting in shadow while the light advances,\nwhich progress cannot distinguish?\n\nIf not one who embodies the Dao and stands above all things,\nwho can partake in this?\n\nThus, the sage knows:\nno thing can truly bind the *Wuji*.\nNext, depart from suffering and uphold the True.\n\n**First, reflect with constancy.**\nTherefore, the sage dwells in non-action.\nThus, the written characters arise in sequence—\nearlier words spoke of the six opposing pairs being unaligned,\nhere dividing the meaning into two gates.\n\nOne: things are unaligned, the six pairs persist.\nTwo: things in mutual dependence find harmony,\nyet through their unalignment, they achieve alignment—\nthis is *having-for* (action).\nTo harmonize through mutual dependence is rigidity.\nAmid unaligned dependence, to stand alone and self-possessed—\nthis is the sage.\nThe sage is one who fulfills their nature.\nTo fulfill one’s nature,\ntalent and Dao merge.\nUnable to fulfill one’s nature,\none may have the sage’s talent but lack the sage’s Dao.\nWith talent but no Dao, one is clever—\ncleverness is artificial.\nWith Dao but no talent, one is plain—\nplainness does not transform.\nOnly when talent and Dao merge is it called *complete virtue*.\nTo adapt to time and respond to change,\nto change without exhaustion,\nthen one can illuminate the Dao of non-action.\nTo illuminate the Dao of non-action,\nto skillfully dwell in non-action;\nto skillfully dwell in non-action,\nto practice the teaching of *wu yan* (non-speech).\n\nAll who dwell within the cosmos\ncannot escape affairs,\nthose in the highest positions\ncannot avoid exertion of the mind.\nFor if mind and affairs run parallel,\nthe principle of non-action is lost.\nIf body and affairs are distant,\nthe ability to dwell well is lost.\nThe sage, seated in one hall,\nsupplies all demands—\nhow could the body be distant from affairs?\nIt must be: *empty the mind and respond to change*.\n\nThough the six pairs come from without,\nby principle, they are fixed within the heart.\nFor the heart gives rise to emotions,\naffairs align with emotions;\nwhen affairs align with emotions,\nthe realm of mutual dependence becomes tangled and confused,\nwithout pause.\nThis is not knowing their fixed nature,\nleaving it to unfold naturally.\nThings have their inherent nature—\nwe follow and govern accordingly.\nThings have their unspoken principles—\nwe remain silent and respond in kind,\nthis is what is called *knowing without action, seeing without clarity*.\n\nHeaven, through non-action, attains clarity—\nthe principle of rewarding virtue and punishing licentiousness is manifest.\nEarth, through non-action, attains tranquility—\nthe sentiment of following Heaven’s law is established.\nThus observed,\nHeaven and Earth—do they have no affairs?\nTo dwell in non-action is all.\n\n**Second, transform things with sincerity.**\nPractice the teaching of *wu yan*.\nThe teaching of *wu yan* is how the sage transforms the world with sincerity.\nTo transform things with sincerity is to observe and transform.\nThe superior transforms the inferior,\nlike wind passing over the earth—\nwhat need for speech?\nZhuangzi said: *Two non-actions merge*—this is it.\n*The Classic of Changes* says: *The sage teaches through the divine method.*\nWhen transformation reaches the divine,\nit is swift without haste, effective without action—\nas Mencius said: *Sagehood beyond knowing is called divine.*\nMoreover, correctness is singular and stops there—\nall my correct things are corrected.\nThus it is said: *When the self is correct, orders need not be given for them to be followed;\nwhen the self is incorrect, even orders will not be obeyed.*\nThese are all teachings of *wu yan*.\n\nYet even so, to transform things with sincerity,\nto lead by example—\nthese are the affairs of governing the world.\nAs for those who call it teaching without virtue,\nthey still bear the intent of earnest instruction—\nperhaps those who do not know *why it is so* are simply following nature.\nWho but the sage can speak of this?\n\nThus, foresight cannot be observed—\nthe poem warning the Duke of Nan warns *Guo Gong*:\n*\"Silk robes and fox-fur garments,\ncomplexion like polished cinnabar—\nthis is your lord!\"*\n\n**Third, the flow of measure is inexhaustible.**\nAll things act yet do not decline.\nEarlier words spoke of the six opposing pairs being unaligned—\nthe sage, with singular insight, awakens,\nshatters illusion, and returns to the True,\ndwelling in the realm of non-action,\nseated amidst the bustle of the world.\nNext, it is said: *All things act yet do not decline*—\nthis reveals the Dao’s function.\n\nWhat is this revealed function?\nNon-action is non-movement.\nNow, all things act—\nfrom where do they come?\nStill, they arise from the non.\nThough it is said that what is born is born of itself,\nwhat transforms transforms of itself—\nthe Dao never takes charge—\nhow then can it be said *not to decline*?",

will reveal itself as evil—*I do not know its evil*;\nhow much more so with goodness and ungoodness?\n\nGoodness that is not good,\nbeauty that is not beautiful—\nwhat else could this be but reckless indulgence?\n\nYet goodness that is not good—\nhow could beauty not be beautiful?\nBeauty that is beautiful—\nhow could goodness not be good?\n\nClarity reveals dust and filth,\nmindful clarity distinguishes good and evil—\nyet fools do the opposite.\n\nAs *Zhuāngzi* said: *\"Good and evil, I call them emotions.\"* (是非吾謂之情者)\n\nWhat I call *without emotion*—\nthat the person does not internally harm themselves with likes and dislikes,\nalways following nature without adding to it.\n\nWhy do worldly beings always fall into the realm of opposites,\nunable to escape their confines?\nThey do not lean toward *having*, yet they lean toward *not having*;\nthey do not cling to *form*, yet they cling to *numbers*.\n\nThus, it is said: *having* and *not having*,\n*difficulty* and *ease*,\n*long* and *short*,\n*high* and *low*,\n*sound* and *voice*,\n*before* and *after*.\n\nExamining their origins,\nthey are not without cause—\nthere must be intent behind them.\n\nNot favoring any single thing—this is called *constant not-having*;\nnot neglecting any single thing—this is called *constant having*.\nHence, *having* and *not having* mutually generate.\n\n*Yán Jūn Píng* (嚴君平) said:\n*\"Without ease, one cannot know difficulty;\nwithout difficulty, one cannot know ease.\"*\n\nThe ancients said: *\"First difficulty, then ease\"* (先難而後獲),\nthe *Classics* say: *\"Many easings, many difficulties\"* (多易又多難).\nHence, *difficulty* and *ease* mutually complete.\n\nWithout *short*, one cannot know *long*;\nwithout *long*, one cannot know *short*—\nas the *Commentary* says: *\"Like the measure of a cubit.\"* (若尺寸是已)\n\nWithout *low*, one cannot know *high*;\nwithout *high*, one cannot know *low*—\nas the *Commentary* says: *\"Like mountains and marshes.\"* (若山泽是已)\n\nWithout *voice*, one cannot know *sound*;\nwithout *sound*, one cannot know *voice*.\nThe *Six Pitches* (六律) harmonize,\nthe *Eight Sounds* (八音) accord—\nthis is the *sound* and *voice* that must harmonize.\n\nWithout *after*, one cannot know *before*;\nwithout *before*, one cannot know *after*.\nSpring comes first, followed by summer,\nthe long precedes the short—\nthis is the *before* and *after* that must succeed.\n\nThe six pairs do not depart from their positions,\nyet when viewed by outward traces,\nthey are never the same;\nwhen viewed by the Dao,\nthey are never different.\n\nNot even like the sage governing the world,\nusing the *Way of non-action* (無為之道) to manage it,\nthen nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nHence, *\"I use non-action, yet the people transform themselves\"* (我無為而民自化),\n*\"I instruct with speechless teaching\"* (以不言之教教之天下),\nmaking the people not desire,\nachieving harmony through stillness and silence.\n\nThe world’s spoken and heard teachings,\nits learned and verbose doctrines—\nwhere would they open their mouths?\n\nHence, *\"I love stillness, yet the people align themselves\"* (我好靜而民自正).\n\nThe sage does nothing.\nIf he acts, then all things see what he has done—\nthis is to have something to govern.\n\nIf one is born and yet has something—\nthey have not forgotten themselves.\nIf one acts and yet depends on it—\nthey have something to rely upon.\nIf one’s deeds complete and yet they dwell upon them—\nthey have something to bind themselves to.\n\nOnly by not acting for oneself,\nnot having anything for oneself,\nnot relying upon anything for oneself,\nnot dwelling upon anything for oneself—\ncan one soar with the Dao above all things,\nand remain ever constant, never departing.\n\n*Huáng Mào Cái* (黃茂材) said:\n*\"The world all knows, yet this does not make one good.\"*\n\nThe eyes find beauty in colors,\nthe ears find beauty in sounds,\nthe mouth finds beauty in flavors—\nthis is what the world calls *beauty*.\n\nIf one takes this as beauty,\nwould it not lead to evil?\n\nTo perform one good act is to be good,\nto speak one good word is to be good—\nthough it may not suffice to advance toward the Dao,\nit does not yet reach the level of evil.\n\nHence, *\"This does not make one good.\"* (斯不善已)\n\nWhat the world calls *beauty* is not sufficient to be beauty,\nwhat the world calls *good* is not sufficient to be good.\n\nThen what is truly *beauty* and *good*?\n\nIt is said:\n*\"Without taste, this is what I call beauty.\"*\n*\"To dwell where others find evil, this is what I call good.\"* (處人所惡，斯吾謂之善也)\n\nOnly when one knows this\ncan they then enter the Dao.»",

Who is it that gives life? Who is it that does?\nThere must be a silent sovereign guiding this.\n\nThe Dao, though nameless, cannot be named;\nthe Dao, though without trace, cannot be traced.\nThus it is said: *\"Act without complaint.\"*\nBut if one claims to have given life and takes credit for its function,\nor acts and relies on its force,\nthen their understanding of the Dao is shallow.\n\nThe Sage embodies this—\nnot possessing, not relying—\nwhat deeds cannot be accomplished?\nTo complete deeds without claiming them\nis to *\"give birth without possessing, act without relying.\"*\nThus, they align with the Dao and become one,\nomitting nothing, needing no distance from others.\n\nProgram Tai said:\n*\"All under heaven know this, yet it is not good.\"*\nWhat is praised and esteemed is called

will surely imitate it.\nLike a lamb in tiger’s skin,\nit only serves to confuse the truth.\n\nThus, when all under heaven know this as *good* and *beauty*,\nthey fall into what is *not good* and *not beautiful*.\n\nWhen the world values humility,\nthere will be those who secretly seek while publicly declining,\npretending to refuse to fulfill their desires.\nWhen frugality is esteemed,\nthere will be those in tattered robes and broken carriages,\ncarrying their own food in a basket—\nthese are those who deliberately degrade themselves\nto satisfy others’ desires, though not truly so.\n\nBut

called *having*.\nIf done deceptively, then it is merely *having-not*.\n\nAccumulating thought and action to achieve *beauty* and *good* is difficult,\nbut mimicking their semblance is easy.\nTrue *beauty* does not generate *beauty* but *evil*,\ntrue *good* does not generate *good* but *not-good*.\nWhy?\nBecause accumulating thought and *good* is difficult,\nwhile selling falsehood as truth is easy.\n\nThus, displaying *beauty* and *good* to observe,\ndesiring all under heaven to follow the easy path—\nthey act to supplement what they lack,\nwhile deceiving those who do not know.\nThis

to the world,\nyet those who lack them feel shame,\nknowing the difficulty—\nwhen they follow the easy path,\nacting to gain what they lack,\ntheir perceived shortcomings become exposed in their striving for superiority,\nthus they prop up their lowliness to topple others’ heights—\nthis is the root of transforming *good* into *evil*, *beauty* into *ugliness*.\n\nSound and music follow one

harmony,\nthey constantly pursue one another.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"I sell it, and they buy it.\"*\nApplying this principle to governance,\nit extends beyond mere harmony of sound and voice.\n\nOne

      "translated_text": "Laozi thus examined the origins of this falsity and reversed it. Within, the mechanism of spontaneous transformation never ceases, yet outwardly, no signs of suppression or elevation are shown. Thus, those who drift between these states cannot know what to follow to ascend. Therefore, he says, *\"The Dao does not enlighten the people; it seeks to make them simple.\"*\n\nThis is the essence of teaching without words.\n\nBut when distinctions of rank are established between teachers and disciples, and precedence is drawn between those born first and last, then even the silent teaching—though profound as the abyss—resounds like thunder.\n\nAll things arise and achieve great deeds without claiming them.\n*\"Arising\"* means to stir and uphold the teaching.\n*\"Generating\"* is like gentle movement, nurturing life—teaching takes root in people, and goodwill begins to sprout, for this is how it gives birth.\n*\"Doing\"* refers to the realm of action, while *\"achievement\"* belongs to those who transform the world through self-so and self-receiving, returning its effects to the Dao.\n\nThe affairs of *wuwei* and the teaching of *non-speech* are not private rules set in every household. Instead, they embrace the vast indifference of Heaven and Earth, governing the four seas with a single touch.\n\nAll who can arise and respond to the teaching are welcomed—none are ever rejected or declined.\n*\"To the good, I am good; to the ungood, I am also good\"*—this is called *not declining*.\n\nWhen goodwill begins to sprout and the teaching takes effect, yet one still refuses to claim credit, this is *not possessing and not relying*.\n\nWhen action, generation, and doing all reach completion, the deed is fulfilled—yet it is abandoned without attachment, as if one had never been involved. Ah! How vast this is.\n\nBefore completion, it is taken as one’s responsibility; when completed, it is not claimed as one’s achievement. This is why the Great Dao does not seek to establish virtue.\n\nOnly what is utterly unceasing endures. All that is formed must eventually decay, all that is numbered must eventually exhaust—thus, all that exists tends toward nonexistence. How then can departure be retained?\n\nBut if achievement is completed without claiming it, it is as if it never existed. What belongs to the Dao cannot be depleted or destroyed—how then can it depart?\n\nThe flowers of spring declare their own virtue in blooming, so their splendor can be replaced. The fruits of autumn take responsibility for gathering and refining, so their harvest can fall. But the Original Qi moves beyond the four seasons, generating without being generated, transforming without being transformed—thus enduring eternally through the ages. This, having neither attachment nor departure, is called *\"from ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, as it oversees all things.\"*\n\nConfucian scholars lament that the people are difficult to awaken, while Laozi laments that they are not simple enough. Hence, he says, *\"The people are difficult to govern because they are too clever,\"* and *\"When the people have many sharp tools, the state grows confused.\"* Yet when speaking of his own approach, he says, *\"The Dao does not enlighten the people; it seeks to make them simple,\"* and *\"Fish cannot be lifted from the depths, nor can the state’s sharp tools be displayed before the people.\"*\n\nPursuing this logic, those who fiercely condemn sagely wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness, desiring to abandon their implements, do not truly oppose these virtues themselves. For he says, *\"Wisdom and insight, when overdeveloped, breed great falsity,\"*—this is the root of his corrective intent.\n\nIndeed, the establishment of rites and laws began with Xuanyu and Yao. Their creation was meant to supplement the simplicity of knotted cords. But once their simplicity was seen as deficient, those who followed inevitably leaned toward excess. When excess grew, institutions and mechanisms spread until they became overt and exposed—then the clever among the people, seeing them, also began to manipulate them. Thus, the sage could use wisdom to restrain the people, while the people could use their cleverness to disrupt the laws.\n\nThis is why Laozi blamed the proliferation of wisdom and sought to correct it with *wuwei*. He feared that enlightening the people would spawn falsity and sought to correct it with *wuji* (non-tracing).\n\nFor rivers fill while valleys empty, hills level while depths fill—once opposites arise, neither can dominate. Thus, sagely wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness must inevitably fall into the realm of abandonment.\n\nYet Laozi, though he ultimately rejects them, still employs them to embody the Dao—so what he truly condemns is not their essence, but the propagation of sharp tools to enlighten the people.\n\nExamining these two passages closely, is it not clear?\n\nWhen he says *\"do not exalt the worthy,\"* he does not mean all are equal in merit—only that he refuses to display them openly. He warns against the danger of erecting grand structures to attract those who seek fame.\n\nWhen the world knows beauty and goodness as beauty and goodness, then entering the realm of *not-beauty* and *not-goodness* is also a silent operation, preventing people from rushing into pretense and false imitation.\n\nYet when teachers and disciples are both employed, with distinctions of high and low, and when movement and stillness are both established, with emotions stirring naturally—though outwardly appearing inclusive, inwardly there remains discrimination.\n\nHe governs the world with an all-encompassing public stance, yet within, he employs subtle mechanisms to move the hearts of people. This method stems from the *Yijing*’s principle of *\"manifesting in virtue, concealing in use.\"* The manifest refers to what can be demonstrated; the concealed refers to the profound, inscrutable source of transformation.\n\nThough rites, music, punishments, and governance have been established as tools of governance, the concern remains that people can be made to follow without truly understanding. Thus, those who grasp the totality of the Dao to craft these tools—even if they wished to reveal it—could find no way to do so.",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the *Yijing*’s principle of *concealing in use* reaches its ultimate expression in *entering the divine* (入神). *Entering the divine* means moving without haste yet swiftly, acting without effort yet arriving with perfect effect. This is precisely what the Old Master (老氏) imitated when he spoke of *\"non-action yet nothing left undone\"* (无为而无不为).\n\nYet, he altered the phrasing, merely applying it as a means to establish his own doctrine. Scholars dare not use this to critique the *Yijing*, but instead all employ it as a basis to condemn the Old Master, which is a matter of unclear judgment indeed.\n\nHowever, his methods of implementation do not entirely diverge from the *Yijing*, and this cannot be concealed. The *Yijing* seeks to *manifest in virtue* (显诸仁) yet fails, thus lamenting the common folk’s ignorance, unable to align them with the *virtue of the wise and the enlightened* (仁智之有见).\n\nThe Old Master, however, directly aims to deceive them, waiting until they are *without knowledge and without desire* (无知无欲), before he then *takes and seizes* (取歙张) them, emerging from within. Here lies their difference.\n\nZhan Qiupu (詹秋圃) said: *\"All under Heaven know ‘the utmost’ yet do not attain it.\"* In the chapter on *Nurturing the Body* (养身), he first seeks to *forget oneself in the realm of unknowing and unrecognizing* (不识不知之表), yet ultimately desires *contraries giving rise to each other* (相反相成), without magnifying his own greatness to dwell in the greatness of all under Heaven.\n\nHence, it is said: *\"All under Heaven know beauty as beauty, goodness as goodness; yet this very pursuit of beauty and goodness may lead to perversion and distortion, resulting in evil and wickedness.\"* The pairing of *\"good deeds\"* (善事) and *\"action\"* (为) reflects how opposites generate each other and reach their extreme in mutual dependence. The rise and fall of each arise from their kind, thus the Sage acts in *non-action* (无为), teaches through *non-speech* (不言), entrusting all things to *this generates that* (此作彼应) without complaint. He gives life yet does not possess it, acts yet does not claim it—though his deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell upon them, but rather *pushes them away* (推之) and they do not depart.\n\nIndeed, those who excel in *nurturing the body* (养身) can *retire after success* (功成身退), thereby *dwelling in security and deepening their roots* (居安资深), and would never lose their *shoulders and backs* (肩背) for the sake of it.\n\nZhang Chongying (张冲应) replied: *\"All under Heaven know ‘the utmost’ yet do not attain it.\"* The Dao abhors excess and upholds humility (谦).\n\nThough talent is beautiful, those who are praised for their beauty will ultimately *arouse envy* (起妬). Though virtue is good, those who are praised for their virtue will ultimately *spark contention* (起争). Envy harms the body, contention harms the body as well. Thus, Pang Juan (庞涓) flaunted his talent and fell into the *tree’s shadow disaster* (树下之失), while Han Xin (韩信) coveted his name and met his end in the *Cloud Dream purge* (云梦之诛). These are matters unworthy of discussion with the *mysterious Dao* (玄道).\n\nThe Sage, when he emerges, does not rely upon his unique talents, but instead harbors the mind of *seeing action in non-action* (见有为无). He does not grudge the difficulty of his accomplishments, but rather holds the thought of *seeing difficulty as ease* (见难为易).\n\nWhen others are short and I extend them, their shortness is covered by my length—thus it is said, *contraries form each other* (相形). When others are high and I humble myself beneath them, their height is suppressed by my lowliness—thus it is said, *contraries topple each other* (相倾).\n\nWhen one responds and the other resonates, their voices harmonize; when one leads and the other follows, above and below align naturally. The Sage governs through *non-action* and teaches through *non-speech*, using the Dao to regulate his body and his body to elucidate the Dao. His true heart is steadfast.\n\nAll things arise, yet his mind remains unperturbed—*desires are extinguished* (贪心绝矣). All things are born, yet he does not possess them—*his will can act yet does not indulge in its own doing* (志可为而不逞所为). Though his deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell in their position—thus Zhang Liang (子房) attained swiftness in *Red Pine’s wandering* (赤松之游速), and Zhongli Quan (锺离权) achieved leisure in *Jade Cavern’s departure* (玉洞之去忙), all through this cultivation.\n\nWith this cultivation, *vital essence endures* (精长固), *qi remains stored* (气长存), *spirit stays clear* (神长清), and thus the body *long-lives* (身长生). *Blessings and virtue* (福德) reside within yet do not depart.\n\nBai Yu Chan (白玉蟾) said: *\"All under Heaven know beauty as beauty, goodness as goodness; those who seek fame in beauty and goodness, though they attain beauty and goodness, cannot escape the rise of evil. Those who seek to be called ‘good,’ though they perform good deeds and benefit others, ultimately become wicked.\"*\n\nHence, *having and non-having generate each other*—non-having must generate having, having must generate non-having. *Difficulty and ease complete each other*—first difficult, then easy; first easy, then difficult again. *Length and shortness form each other*—the Dao itself is formless, yet through self-extension, length and shortness arise. *High and low topple each other*—Heaven revolves, Earth turns; originally there is no high or low.\n\n*Voices harmonize*—when one wind sounds, all ten thousand echoes respond. *Front and back follow each other*—the past is the present, the present is the past.\n\nThus, the Sage governs through *non-action* and values *naturalness* (自然). He teaches through *non-speech* and the Dao is embodied in things. All things arise from this, yet he does not refuse it.\n\nNon-having must generate having—how could it not generate? If it did not generate, how could it endure long? He gives life yet does not possess it—non-having is merely false illusion. He acts yet does not claim it—*today is today alone* (今日今日而已). Though his deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell upon them—*how could it compare with reality, to dream of it?*\n\nOnly in *not dwelling* (弗居) does he *forget the external yet not forget the internal*—thus it is said, *it does not depart* (不去). *One self remains stored* (一我自存).\n\nLiao Cuiran (廖粹然) said: *\"All under Heaven know goodness as goodness; people take color, sound, fragrance, flavor, and physical form (触法) as their objects of attachment, indulging in joy, anger, love, hatred, sorrow, delight, and desires to make them their ‘strong goods’ (强美). I know this is not so.*\n\nWhy is this not so? Because *this very attachment is the root of evil* (斯恶已). Thus, those who love affairs are plagued by *demons* (魔), the *Seven Emotions* (七情) assault from within, the *Six Bandits* (六贼) invade from without, and all desires ultimately harm the body. I habitually remain *serene and indifferent* (恬憺无为), considering *learning the Dao and attaining the Dao* (学道得道) as the true ‘strong goods’—is this not beautiful?\n\nAll under Heaven know goodness as goodness, yet they also believe that goodness is the most joyous. Some perform good deeds, aid others, and benefit all things—these are all considered good actions. *I see otherwise*—why is this so?",
      "overlap_context": "Yijing*’s principle of *\"manifesting in virtue, concealing in use.\"* The manifest refers to what can be demonstrated; the concealed refers to the profound, inscrutable source of transformation.\n\nThough rites, music, punishments, and governance have been established as tools of governance, the concern remains that people can be made to follow without truly understanding. Thus, those who grasp the totality of the Dao to craft these tools—even if they wished to reveal it—could find no way to do so.",

      "translated_text": "「This is not virtue—why is this so? People are not Yao or Shun, yet some, before doing good deeds, first seek reward, bribing the superiors to keep their hearts. Others, when they have done good, fear it was not fully complete, and regret their efforts. I have practiced *clearing and quieting* (清静) to cultivate *awareness* (定慧), *calming the heart and nurturing the spirit* (安心养神), and thus regard *upholding the Dao and achieving its fulfillment* (守道而成功) as the supreme virtue—is this not joyous?\n\nHence, *the interplay of presence and absence* (有无相生) arises—this speaks of the *marvelous application of virtue and Dao* (道德妙用). *Difficulty and ease interdepend* (难易相成), marking the *beginning of transformation* (造化始端). *Length and shortness contrast* (长短相形), revealing the *substance and measure* (器质法度) of things. *High and low incline* (高下相倾), as Heaven and Earth undergo their ceaseless changes (变通). *Sounds harmonize* (音声相和), carried by winds and breaths (风气吹嘘). *Past and future follow* (前后相随), giving rise to the *birth and evolution of all things* (古今生化). These are all *the Dao’s marvels* (道妙), inexhaustible in their depth. Therefore, the sage *Laozi* (太上老子), known by the name of *Dao-attainment* (得道), is also called *Great Supreme* (大上), *Sage* (圣人), *the Virtuous One* (有道之士), *the Ruler of Men* (人主), *the Daoist* (道者), *the Lord of the Heart* (心君), or *the Great Man* (大丈夫)—each title fitting the occasion. To dwell in *non-action* (无为之事) is the *root principle* (根本). To practice *teaching without words* (行不言之教), the *Great Supreme* says:\n\n*\"Silent, silent, silent—\nwithout bound, the Dao’s transcendent ones are born from this.\"*\n\nAll things act without claiming merit (作而不辞). The common folk use them daily, yet do not know they are my Dao. *To give birth without possession* (生而不有), *to transform endlessly* (生化无穷). *To act without reliance* (为而不恃), *to bestow kindness without seeking reward* (施恩而不望报). *To complete deeds without dwelling on them* (功成弗居), *to bring forth all things yet not lord over them* (生成万物而不为主). Only by *not dwelling on them* (弗居), *doing so out of self-love yet not arrogating superiority* (自爱而不自贵), is it that *they are never abandoned* (是以不去). Enduring from ancient times to the present, without beginning or end (亘古亘今，无来无去).\n\n*Chen Bi Xu* (陈碧虚) said: All under Heaven know that virtue is not exhausted here—why is this so? For all under Heaven (天下者) refers to the *general scope* (举大凡而言) of everything beneath Heaven’s canopy (凡在天覆之下也). Virtue and goodness arise from *delusive emotions* (妄情). Ordinary people take what their emotions favor as good and what they reject as evil. If one indulges in *delusive emotions* (纵己妄情), what is not evil? They take what they affirm as good and what they deny as not good. If one indulges in *judgments of right and wrong* (纵己是非), how can there be true goodness?\n\n*Zhuangzi* (庄子) said: Right and wrong are what I call *emotion* (情也). What I call *non-emotion* (无情者) is that people do not let their likes and dislikes internally harm their bodies; they follow their natural state without adding artificiality (常因自然而不益生也). This is called *stopping at what is truly fitting* (止於实当也).\n\nThe Sage, then, has virtue and goodness—yet they do not boast of them, making them equal to none. *Not boasting preserves their virtue* (不矜则德全), *equaling none keeps harm at bay* (同於无则害远). When virtue is complete and harm is distant, virtue and goodness are fully realized (美善尽矣). If rulers use virtue and goodness to transform all under Heaven, making them know virtue as virtue, this is not yet complete goodness. Hence, I say the *Book of Martial Virtue* (《武》) is fully beautiful, yet not fully virtuous (未尽善也). The *Classic* (《经》) says: *\"The supreme virtue does not claim virtue* (上德不德), *the lesser virtue does not lose virtue* (下德不失德也).\"\n\nMoreover, virtuous people are few, while the unvirtuous are many. If one flaunts their virtuous deeds, stealing and mocking them, this is already evil—how can it be called virtue?\n\n*Yan Jun Ping* (严君平) said: Clarity does not always endure, darkness does not always prevail. Honor and decay begin at the *Spring Equinox* (仲春), *qí mài* (荠麦) and *yáng wù* (阳物) emerge at the *Autumn Equinox* (秋分). On the *Winter Solstice* (冬至), all things flourish and thrive (滋滋), while on the *Summer Solstice* (夏至), all things wither and lament (愁悲). It speaks of how even at their peak, things must decline, and beauty must yield to evil (盛叉有衰，美必有恶). If this is true of *yin and yang* (阴阳), how much more so for humanity? This is a warning against *boasting of virtue and goodness* (矜夸美善者也).\n\nThus, from *the interplay of presence and absence* (有无之相生) to *the following of past and future* (前后之相随), these six principles arise—*because boasting of virtue and goodness leads to active interference* (因矜美善动入有为), *and once interference is evident, partiality and fixation emerge* (有为既彰，偏执斯起). Partiality and fixation breed mutual destruction (残贼互生), and things lose their nature (物失其性). Hence, the Sage’s *non-action* (无为) and *profound virtue* (渊德) remain unyielding (不去).\n\nThe interplay of presence and absence (有无之相生) is that *presence and absence inherently do not generate each other*—yet *to speak of presence, it must arise from absence*, and *to discuss absence, it must be born from presence*—hence, *presence and absence interdepend* (故曰有无之相生).\n\nDifficulty and ease interdepend (难易之相成者也): It is that *difficulty and ease inherently do not form each other*—yet *like the potter, who finds clay easy to shape yet wood difficult*, or *the carpenter, who finds wood easy to work yet clay difficult*, *each finds what is easy in their own craft, yet difficulty emerges where it diverges*—thus, *difficulty and ease interdepend* (故曰难易之相成也).\n\nLength and shortness contrast (长短之相刑者): It is that *length and shortness inherently do not define each other*—yet *when one sees a crane, one knows the mallard’s legs are short*, and *when one sees a mallard, one knows the crane’s legs are long*. By this mutual reference, all things are so—hence, *length and shortness contrast* (故曰长短之相形也).」",

withdrawal into empty halls,\nBut the Sage forgetting all virtues, extinguishing emotions, restoring innate nature,\nSo the people act according to their capacities,\nThings settle into their proper order,\nAnd above and below remain undisturbed.\nThus, it is said: *\"to dwell in non-action.\"*\n\nTo practice the teaching of *non-speech* means\nTo lead by personal example, rectify conduct, and intuitively respond to circumstances,\nActing in season, leveraging resources, achieving results without deliberate speech—\nThus, *\"to practice the teaching of non-speech.\"*\n\nWhen all things act, the Sage does not claim credit.\n*Action* means movement.\nThe Sage governs the world in effortless ease,\nDoing nothing, yet the people till and eat,\nWeave and clothe themselves,\nContent with suckling, joyful with full bellies,\nPlaying without aim—\nDelighting in their natural endowments,\nAll movements virtuous, the transformation of *non-action*.\n\nThus, the Sage entrusts them without interference.\nThe people can be led but not made to understand—\nThis is the wind of the Supreme Virtue’s *non-virtue*.\n\nBorn yet not possessing, achieving yet not dwelling.\nAll things generate spontaneously, each in its own transformation,\nNot claimed as one’s own, yet all striving fulfills its nature,\nNot relying on personal merit—\nWhen deeds are complete and affairs settled,\nThe Way is realized in things,\nThe mind wanders at Maoshu’s peaks,\nNot lording over the people—\nThis is the Sage’s complete virtue.\n\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart.\nThe Sage’s deeds align with Nature’s creation,\nEnsuring all things reach their utmost,\nYet forgets name and self.\n\n*Not dwelling* means not claiming rank or treasure as one’s own,\nSo the people remain unaware, unknowing—\nThus, the Way does not perish, virtue does not fade.\n\n*The Honglie Explanation* says:\nWhen Chu’s General Zi Fa attacked Cai Yu, King Xuan of Qin welcomed him at the capital,\nGranting him a hundred *mu* of land and the ceremonial jade tablet of a high official.\nZi Fa declined, saying:\n*\"To govern a state and establish policies, to receive visiting lords—\nThis is the king’s virtue.\nTo issue commands and the enemy flees before battle—\nThis is the general’s might.\nTo array troops and defeat the foe—\nThis is the common soldier’s strength.\nTo ride upon the people’s labor and take their rewards—\nThis is not the Way of Ren and Yi.\"*\nThus, he declined and did not accept.\n\nHence, *\"achieving yet not dwelling\"*—\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart.\n\nXie Tusou said:\nAll under Heaven know what is supremely good.\nWhen the Sage governs the world,\nGood governance and fine transformations penetrate the hearts of the people,\nYet they do not recognize them as such.\nLater generations implement a policy or decree, and the people call it good;\nThey establish a benefit or remove a harm, and the people praise it—\nThis is not impossible,\nYet what is manifest to all may not touch their hearts.\n\nThus, the unknowing are deeply moved,\nWhile the knowing barely acknowledge it—\nThe profound is hard to exhaust, the shallow easily exposed.\nIf it is easily exposed,\nThen the shift from good to evil, from virtue to vice,\nIs but a turn of the hand—\nHence the warning against *having* and *not having*, *difficulty* and *ease*—\nIts meaning is profound.\n\nThus, *having* and *not having* are inseparably linked.\nWithout level, there is no slope;\nWithout forward, there is no return.\nThe Sage alone ensures that what is called *good* is not evil,\nThat what is called *virtue* is not vice.\n\nWithout life, there is no death;\nDeath gives rise to life again.\nDifficulty becomes ease, ease becomes difficulty;\nLength and shortness, height and low—\nMutually contrasted, tilted, reversing, ever-changing,\nWith no fixed beginning.\n\nLike sounds moving to tones’ harmony,\nOr what precedes guiding what follows—\nThis is the necessary logic, the inevitable course.\n\nThus, the Sage’s virtue is never lost.\nThe Sage knows the world’s nature is ever-shifting,\nSo he follows Nature’s spontaneous order,\nActs without contrivance,\nTeaches without speech—\nYet when called *good* or *beautiful*,\nWho can truly know?\n\nWhen things must act, the Sage does not shirk responsibility;\nWhen things must be born, the Sage does not claim the benefit;\nDoing without doing, yet not relying on ability;\nAchieving without achieving, yet not dwelling on success—\nAll under Heaven find their proper place,\nWhile the Sage seems uninvolved.\n\nYet though he does not dwell on his deeds,\nWhere would the world turn without the Sage?\nThe Sage has no designs on the world,\nYet the world cannot be without the Sage.\n\nThis is why it was the age of ancient Sage-Kings.\nIndeed, examining it:\nThe rise and fall of ages, the waxing and waning of human nature and things—\nHow unequal they are!\n\nThe *Tai* yielding to *Pi*, *Yi* to *Sun*,\n*Sue* to *Jian*, *Ji* to *Wei*—\nThe *Yi* has already spoken of this.\nYet the Sage comprehends these transformations,\nDivinizes their changes,\nEver guiding the people through tireless motion,\nMoving them in the realm of the unknown—\nThus, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun\nGoverned with effortless ease,\nYet the world was in harmony,\nAnd all things flourished without decree.",

to unsettle the people’s ears and eyes?\nIt is like cutting colored silk to claim elegance,\nOr drawing water to feign depth.\nThe intent of nurturing and propagating life does not dwell within them,\nAnd their downfall comes swiftly and surely.\nHow could they ever be considered models of perfect virtue and beauty?\n\nLin Yongzai remarked: *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling to it.*\nThis chapter embodies the principle of *having while not possessing*.\n\nWhere there is beauty, there is ugliness;\nWhere there is virtue, there is vice.\nBeauty unknown as beauty,\nVirtue unknown as virtue—\nThen there is no ugliness, no vice.\n\nFor all things in the world,\nThere is presence and absence,\nDifficulty and ease,\nLength and brevity,\nHeight and low,\nSound and voice,\nFront and back.\nThe six lines of *mutual generation and completion*\nAll metaphorically illustrate the paired opposites of beauty and ugliness,\nVirtue and vice.\n\nThus, the Sage acts without action,\nSpeaks without words—\nNever shirking emptiness as idle,\nNor fearing excess as laborious,\nBut simply completing the task without claiming it.\n\nLike the heavens and earth nurturing myriad things,\nThrough endless transformations and changes,\nPursuing one another without end—\nDid they ever cease their toil?\nAll things flourish under heaven and earth,\nYet heaven and earth never claim them as their own.\nLike spring and summer, life and death,\nCreation’s work never relies on them as proof of its power.\nThus, they give birth without possession,\nAct without reliance—\nTheir intent lies solely in *completing the task without claiming it*.\n\nHence, the three lines: *All things act, yet they do not claim to be the originators.*\n*—作* (zuò) is akin to the *Yijing*’s *Kūn* (坤), which \"acts to complete things.\"*\nThis reflects Shun and Yu’s *receiving the Mandate of Heaven yet not taking it as their own*.\n\nFrom ancient times, all Sages were thus—\nWhy single out Laozi?\n\nOnly by *not claiming* does one *not lose*.\nThose who possess what they have cannot truly have it,\nWhile those who do not claim what they possess can truly have it.\nThese eight characters hold profound meaning.\nThe *Shū* (书) says: *He who has virtue yet loses virtue*—\nThis is its very essence.\n\nWhen sound harmonizes with form, it is called *music*—\nHence, *sound and voice in accord*.\n\nFan Yingyuan noted: *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling to it.*\n*—至* (zhì) is pronounced *yǐ* (以), a grammatical particle.\nSince ancient times, Sages have embodied this Dao in their dealings with affairs—\nTheir way of attaining perfect beauty and virtue,\nYet people unaware of their true beauty and virtue,\nIs that affairs unfold naturally,\nEach with its proper course.\n\nThus, the Sage follows nature’s logic,\nActs with measured harmony,\nNever boasting or claiming credit for beauty or virtue.\nIf one boasts of beauty or claims virtue,\nAnd makes all under Heaven aware of it—\nThen ugliness and vice must surely follow.\nHence, *presence and absence generate and follow one another.*\n\nThis further confirms the opposites of beauty and ugliness,\nVirtue and vice.\nTherefore, the Sage’s *uttermost teaching*.\n\nThe Sage’s *uttermost teaching*—\nThis is the meaning of *continuing from above to below*.\nThe Sage, pure in the Dao,\nAlso called *the great and transformative*—\nAll that follows does likewise.\n\nTo dwell in *non-action* is to embody the Dao—\nThe Dao is ever *non-acting* yet never *not acting*,\nAnd the Sage remains empty-hearted while responding to things.\n\nTo practice *unsaid teaching* is to align with Heaven—\nHeaven speaks not, yet\nThe four seasons pass in its course,\nAnd myriad creatures flourish in its embrace.\nThe Sage follows principle to benefit all,\nNothing left unaligned—\nThis is the *unsaid teaching*.\n\n*All things act, yet they do not claim to be the originators*—\nThe ancient texts, as per Wang Bi and Yang Xu, agree.\n\n*—作* (zuò) is motion.\nSilent and still, yet sensing and thus fully responsive—\nThis is the Dao.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao in establishing things,\nResponds only after being moved,\nThus, *they do not claim to be the originators*.\n\nFrom *giving birth without possession* to *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling*—\nFu Yi remarked: *The ancient texts all read \"dwell\" (处).*\nAll things’ generation, propagation, and movement\nArise from the Dao.\nYet the Dao never claims them as its own,\nNor relies on them for its power—\nUntil the task is complete, it never dwells on it.\nOnly by *not dwelling on the task’s completion*\nDoes one ensure that things do not resist.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao in standing,\nThus also *they give birth without possession*—\nHow could ugliness and vice follow?\n\nXue Yongzai said: *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling*—\n*To the paired opposites of front and back.*\n\nWhere there is beauty, there is ugliness;\nWhere there is virtue, there is vice—\nNo affair in the world lacks its counterpart.\nThese six are but one corner of the whole.\n\nYanzi’s *\"As if standing firm upon something\"*—\nSurely there are opposites to it.\n\nTherefore, the Sage’s *uttermost teaching*.\n*—作而不为* (zuò ér bù wéi) is the affair of *non-action*,\n*—言而不言* (yán ér bù yán) is the teaching of *no words*—\nThe Sage thus transcends all opposites.\n\nHeaven and earth are *unbenevolent*,\nTreating myriad things as *straw dogs*.\nThe Sage conforms to and mirrors them.\nOnly by *not claiming* does one *not lose*—\nIn their lack of dwelling, they also lack nothing to abandon.\n\nResting in the *Resting Pavilion* (休休庵) remarked:\n*All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling*—\n*To the paired opposites of front and back.*\n\nThe Three Powers established,\nMyriad things born,\nRadiance and luster flourish,\nNames and forms appear.\nCommon folk know myriad things’ beauty,\nTheir utility in sustaining life—\nYet those who prize it fail to recognize the nurturing grace,\nThis is called *ugliness*.\n\nEven if all know that creation’s movement,\nLife and death’s unfolding,\nIs virtue—\nThose who take this as virtue\nOnly see the Three Powers’ *virtue/power*,\nYet fail to grasp the great Dao,\nThis is called *vice*.\n\nAlas! To be blind to the Dao and lost in virtue,\nTo chase superficial ends while forgetting the root—\nDay by day, their corruption deepens.\n\nThough humans are the most enlightened,\nThey cannot reflect upon their original,\nPure, luminous, and wondrous nature—\nEndowed with great *divine penetration*,\nCapable of mastering all phenomena,\nPossessing *non-action’s wondrous efficacy*—\nYet they pursue illusions and vie in *action*,\nTheir emotions and perceptions ensnared,\nBound by the Five Desires and Eight Winds,\nTheir greed, anger, delusion, and attachment wreaking havoc.",

arises,\nSpring precedes, summer follows—\nEven these mutually arising and fulfilling opposites\nCannot forever preserve beauty and virtue,\nHow much more so when they contrast and incline against one another?\n\nThe Sage investigates the origins,\nRescues defects,\nLeading by example—\nNon-action yet deeds are accomplished,\nNo words yet teachings are established,\nPeople enjoy their customs,\nThings fulfill their nature.\n\nPlowing, digging, sowing—\nThese are things’ deeds,\nI do not reject them,\nNurturing and fostering their growth.\n\nThese are things’ births,\nI do not claim them,\nLetting things act naturally—\nWhat must be done cannot be avoided by me.\nWhy should I rely on my own efforts?\n\nOnly because they do not dwell in great deeds,\nThus their deeds cannot be abandoned.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"I forget the world easily,\nBut making the world forget me is difficult.\"*\nTruly so.\n\nSome may debate:\nWhy, after naming the Dao as \"non-existence,\"\nDoes this chapter suddenly turn to beauty and vice,\nAnd the six pairs of opposites?\n\nFor where the Dao exists,\nThings arise;\nWhere things arise,\nNames follow.\nWhat is called \"non-existence\" is hidden,\nBut beauty and vice are names of things,\nAnd deeds’ traces cannot escape the six pairs.\n\nThe Sage does not defy things’ nature,\nBut lets them flow, rise, and fall—\nSometimes contrary to principle,\nYet adjusts and rectifies accordingly,\nTreating ailments with medicine,\nEach restored to health.\n\nWhen the illness departs and the medicine is removed,\nThe Sage’s heart is also empty.\nHow can the six pairs of opposites be avoided?\n\nNiu Miao said:\n*\"All know the Dao’s utmost extent,\nYet fail to depart from it—\nBeauty is delight,\nVirtue is also delight.\nVice and non-virtue are both spoken of as not delightful.\"*\n\nEven as in the world a single good deed,\nOnce fixed, is sure to turn bad—\nThis is the hidden calamity in prosperity,\nThe danger in

Ming!*—its call still seeks a harmonizing response.\n\n《易》曰：呜鹤在阴，其子和之。\nThe *Yijing* says: *The wailing crane is in the shade—its offspring responds in harmony.*\n\n此声响之相随，犹形之於影，\n自然而并生，俱出而俱没也。\nThis is how sound and echo follow one another,\nLike form and shadow—\nBoth arise naturally together,\nAnd vanish as one.\n\n夫音者，本无待於声也，\n声发而响随之耳。\nFor resonance is not dependent on sound—\nIt is only when sound is emitted that echo follows.\n\n如人言凶则气粗，声和则气悦，\n爱人者人常爱之，敬人者人常敬之，\n未尝不由己出，其犹音响之於鸣声，\n此固然之理也。\nWhen one speaks harshly, their *qi* grows coarse,\nAnd when their voice is harmonious, their *qi* is pleasing—\nThose who love others are often loved in return,\nAnd those who honor others are often honored in turn.\nThis is never otherwise—\nJust as echo follows utterance,\nSo too does this principle hold true.\n\n前后之相随。\nThe interplay of before and after.\n\n夫身行於前，影必随之后，\n阳唱於前，阴必和於后。\nFor when the body moves forward, the shadow follows behind,\nAnd when the Yang leads, the Yin must harmonize.\n\n此影形相逐，阴阳相和，\n前后相随，此则必然之理也。\nThis is how shadow chases form,\nAnd Yin harmonizes with Yang—\nBefore and after follow one another—\nThis is the inevitable principle.\n\n《孔丛子》曰：前譬之古也，后譬之今也。\nThe *Kong Congzi* says: Before is like the past,\nAnd after is like the present.\n\n古今相继，犹前后之相随，\n初无间然也。\nPast and present follow one another,\nJust as before and after—\nThere is no separation.\n\n澄明子曰：前者始条理也，后者终条理也。\nThe Sage Chengming said: Before is the beginning of order,\nAnd after is its completion.\n\n未闻有前而无后也，\n亦未见有始而无终也。\nI have never heard of a before without an after,\nNor seen a beginning without an end.\n\n前后一理也，始终一贯也。\nBefore and after are one principle,\nAnd beginning and end are a continuous thread.\n\n不由於前而至於后者，天下无之。\nThere is nothing in the world that does not arise from before and reach after.\n\n此大修行人初以无为居其前，\n无不为必继之於后，\n此自然之道也。\nThus, the great cultivator first abides in *wuwei* (non-action),\nAnd *wuwei* must inevitably follow—\nThis is the Way of Nature.\n\n是以圣人处无为之事。\nTherefore, the Sage governs through *wuwei*.\n\n圣人者，天下之至人也。\nThe Sage is the ultimate person in the world.\n\n而曰处无为之事者，何哉？\nYet why is it said that the Sage governs through *wuwei*?\n\n夫无为者，简易也。\nFor *wuwei* is simplicity.\n\n盖圣人者德并二仪，\n故参乾坤之理，而从於简易也。\nThe Sage’s virtue encompasses both Yang and Yin,\nThus they grasp the principles of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd follow simplicity.\n\n何以知之？\n《易》曰：乾以易知，坤以简能。\nHow do we know this?\nThe *Yijing* says: *Heaven is known through ease, Earth through simplicity.*\n\n易则易知，简则易从。\nEase is easy to understand,\nAnd simplicity is easy to follow.\n\n易知则有亲，易从则有功。\nEase to understand brings familiarity,\nAnd simplicity to follow yields effectiveness.\n\n有亲则可久，有功则可大。\nFamiliarity allows endurance,\nAnd effectiveness allows greatness.\n\n可久则贤人之德，可大则贤人之业。\nEndurance is the virtue of the worthy,\nAnd greatness is their accomplishment.\n\n易简而天下之理得矣。\nThrough ease and simplicity, the world’s principles are attained.\n\n此圣人之所以处无为之事也。\n\n行不言之教。\nTo practice the teaching that does not speak.\n\n夫不言者，忘言也。\nFor not speaking is forgetting speech.\n\n盖忘言之中，至理存焉。\nWithin forgetting speech, the highest principles remain.\n\n谓天下之理尽在不言之中，\n故圣人得其奥理，默而行之，\n故云行不言之教也。\nFor the world’s principles are entirely contained in not speaking—\nThus the Sage attains their profound essence,\nAnd acts in silence,\nHence it is said: *To practice the teaching that does not speak.*\n\n然夫不言之教，谓天道也，\n盖天道不言而善应也。\nYet the teaching that does not speak refers to the Dao of Heaven—\nFor Heaven’s Dao does not speak yet responds with goodness.\n\n孔子曰：天何言哉？\n四时行焉，百物生焉。\n天何言哉？\nIs this not what Confucius said?\n*Heaven speaks not—*\nYet the four seasons proceed in their order,\nAnd all things flourish in their time.\n*Heaven speaks not—*\n\n是以圣人观天之道，执天之行，\n故云行不言之教也。\nThus the Sage observes Heaven’s Dao,\nAnd follows its actions,\nHence it is said: *To practice the teaching that does not speak.*\n\n《易》曰：天生神物，圣人则之。\n天地变化，圣人效之。\n天垂象见吉凶，圣人象之。\n河出图洛出书，圣人则之。\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*Heaven births divine things—*\nThe Sage follows them.\n*Heaven and Earth transform—*\nThe Sage imitates them.\n*Heaven displays symbols to show auspiciousness and inauspiciousness—*\nThe Sage mirrors them.\n*The Yellow River reveals its map,*\n*The Luo River its script—*\nThe Sage follows them.\n\n夫神物变化，吉凶图书，\n亦未尝有言也，\n而圣人则效法象，\n斯非行不言之教之谓欤？」\nFor divine things and transformations,\nAnd symbols of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness,\nThere is no speech—\nYet the Sage responds by imitating their forms,\nIs this not the practice of the teaching that does not speak?",

      "translated_text": "Is this not what is meant?\n\nZhuangzi’s *Inner Chapters* says: *\"All under Heaven knows this, yet it does not depart.\"* Beauty lies within oneself, not in others. Goodness lies within oneself, not in others. Now, if one accumulates a single beauty yet desires all under Heaven to know it, then it is no longer beauty; if one performs a single good deed yet desires all under Heaven to know it, then it is no longer goodness.\n\nThe affairs of the world have opposites—what exists has its nonexistent counterpart, what is difficult has its easy counterpart, what is long has its short counterpart, what is high has its low counterpart. They generate and complete each other, contrast and incline toward each other, like echoes responding to sound, shadows following form.\n\nThe Sage encompasses all with effortless spontaneity. His actions are without contrivance, his teachings without words. Like Heaven, he nurtures all things without toil, with life’s function yet no trace of creation, with deeds yet no claim to labor. Our Master said: *\"Only Heaven is great, only Yao followed it.\"* Broad and boundless, the people cannot name it.\n\nThe Sage follows Heaven’s Way by accomplishing deeds yet not dwelling upon them. At its utmost, goodness accumulates and his name becomes renowned; virtue shines and his person is honored. He does not seek fame, yet fame follows him. Though he wished to depart from it, how could he depart?\n\nThe Master of Chu’s Retreat said: *\"Those who possess what they possess cannot truly possess it; those who lack what they possess can truly possess it.\"* This is truly speaking to the heart’s essence.\n\nThe character *去* (départ) is read as in *\"the noble departs from benevolence.\"*\n\nThe ancient scholars said: *\"If one seeks virtue yet avoids fame, then there are no deeds worth doing under Heaven. The Sage has intent in doing good yet no intent in gaining fame, yet fame cannot ultimately be made to depart—just as sound harmonizes with sound, and form follows shadow.\"*\n\nWhen read from beginning to end, the entire chapter’s meaning flows together like a pulse, its threads interconnected. It concludes by reiterating: *\"Only because he does not dwell upon it, it does not depart.\"* This is not merely a marvel of composition but a profound teaching for humanity.\n\nXu Liu said: *\"All under Heaven knows this, yet it does not depart\"*—the meaning echoes throughout.\n\nWealth is the root of misfortune, and joy the source of sorrow; this is the natural order. None can perceive it, so the Sage, moved by pity for the world’s ignorance, declares: *\"All under Heaven knows beauty and goodness, rushing toward and delighting in them, yet does not know that evil and harm arise from them.\"*\n\nThis principle is like the generation of having and lacking, the completion of difficulty and ease, the contrast of length and shortness, the inclination of high and low, the harmony of sound and echo, the succession of before and after. From ancient times to now, all things and affairs have their opposites, like an endless ring.\n\nOnly the Sage stands alone, without counterpart. Thus the Sage dwells in non-action, yet it does not depart.\n\nOnly the Sage stands independent, with no opposing counterpart. For he dwells in non-action, practices teaching without words.\n\nNon-action is not inaction—it means following nature’s spontaneity, responding without contrivance, and thus achieving harmony.\n\nTeaching without words is not mere silence—it means sincere inner cultivation and loyal, trustworthy outward conduct. The world follows him without effort or expenditure. Though he daily responds to myriad affairs, he leads yet does not initiate, so he does not weary of labor—hence it is said: *\"He acts yet does not claim the deed.\"* The people are nourished by his care alone, with no personal gain—hence it is said: *\"He gives life yet does not possess.\"* He establishes deeds and fulfills his role, acting only as duty demands, without boasting of his own ability—hence it is said: *\"He acts yet does not rely upon it.\"* When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled, he retreats and yields his position—hence it is said: *\"He accomplishes deeds yet does not dwell upon them.\"*\n\nOnly thus, by following Heaven’s Dao, is his person preserved and his deeds enduring. Therefore, his fame is praised across ten thousand generations without ceasing. Hence it is said: *\"It does not depart.\"*\n\n*Zhiyi’s* *Collected Remnants* says: *\"Having and lacking generate each other, just as there must be low if there is high. Thus, though having and lacking differ, both ultimately escape the realm of mere possession.\"* This speaks to the forms of things, borrowing the contrast of having and lacking to illustrate it.\n\nGuang [commentary] says: *\"These six pairs are why things are unequal; only those who lose their counterparts can achieve harmony.\"*\n\nFrom *Cross-Referencing the Masters*:\n*The Master Zhuang* says: *\"The Dao can be weak yet strong, soft yet hard, yin yet yang, hidden yet manifest, encompassing Heaven and Earth, responding without measure. To know shallowly is to not know deeply; to know externally is to not know internally; to know coarsely is to not know finely. To know is to not know; to not know is to know. Who knows that knowing is not knowing, and not knowing is knowing? The Dao cannot be heard—hearing it is false. The Dao cannot be seen—seeing it is false. The Dao cannot be spoken—speaking it is false. Who knows the formless form?*\n\n*\"Therefore, all under Heaven knows goodness as goodness, yet it is no longer goodness. The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\"*\n\nShi Tan said: *\"All under Heaven knows beauty as beauty, yet it is already evil. All know goodness as goodness, yet it is no longer goodness.\"*\n\nThus, having and lacking generate each other, difficulty and ease complete each other, length and shortness contrast each other, high and low incline toward each other, sound harmonizes with sound, before follows after. Beauty and evil, goodness and harm, having and lacking, difficulty and ease, length and shortness, high and low—all are relative terms without fixed names.\n\nWhen there is beauty, there is evil in opposition; when there is goodness, there is harm in opposition. Hence it is said: *\"All under Heaven knows beauty as beauty, yet it is already evil; all know goodness as goodness, yet it is no longer goodness.\"*",

      "translated_text": "When it comes to having, there is lacking in opposition; having difficulty, there is ease in opposition; having length, there is shortness in opposition; having height, there is lowliness in opposition. Thus, they generate and complete each other, contrast and incline toward each other.\n\nYet these are all opposites, but as for sound and sequence, they are not starkly opposed, yet why are they included as well? Truly, the Way in which they generate and complete each other, contrast and incline toward each other, is also like the harmonization of sound and the following of sequence—this is the natural principle.\n\nThis further illustrates that even what does not seem opposite is used to describe what must be opposite. Therefore, the Sage handles the affairs of *wuwei* (無為, non-action), and practices the teaching of *busheng* (不言, non-speech).\n\n*Wuwei* and *busheng* are both means to embody the Dao’s *wu ming* (無名, namelessness). With names come action and speech. Since the Dao has no name, what need is there for speech and action?\n\nThus, it transcends the realm of beauty and evil, goodness and harm. Only in *wuwei* and *busheng* can beauty even be named—what of evil? Only in *wuwei* and *busheng* can goodness be named—what of harm?\n\nAll things arise, yet the Sage does not claim them; they are born, yet the Sage does not possess them. Act without relying upon it; when the work is done, do not dwell upon it.\n\nAll things arise, yet I do not claim them—let them arise. They are born, yet I do not possess them—I though give birth to them, yet never claim that they are mine to give birth to.\n\nAct without relying upon it—I act through *wuwei* (non-action), yet never rely upon what I have done. When the work is done, I do not dwell upon it—though I give birth to them, it cannot be said that I have no merit, yet I do not dwell upon that merit.\n\nThus, though I am beautiful, others do not know me as such; though I am good, others do not know me as such.\n\nOnly by not dwelling upon it does its essence remain. If one dwells upon it, it departs. If I dwell upon my beauty, when beauty’s name departs, it becomes evil. If I dwell upon my goodness, when goodness’s name departs, it becomes harm.\n\nOnly by handling the affairs of *wuwei* (non-action), practicing the teaching of *busheng* (non-speech), acting without claiming, giving birth without possessing, acting without relying upon it, and completing the work without dwelling upon it—thus, its name does not depart.\n\nIts name does not depart, then it is my name.

In this chapter, it is made clear that the noble and esteemed are not to be relied upon, and *wuwei* (non-action) leads to the ultimate principle.\n\nFirst, it is stated that one should not esteem the virtuous, thereby severing the traces of arrogance and partiality. Next, the *saintly principle* (圣理) is mentioned, demonstrating the method of establishing the teaching, concluding with *wuwei* (non-action) to show that transformation is complete yet returns to simplicity.\n\n*Du Guangting* (杜光庭) said: The great sage establishes the principle, while the virtuous assist it. How can they be like fish and water without relying upon each other? From the sovereign of the Five Phases (二五之主) down to the tyrant-king (霸王之君), those who open states and establish their foundations depend upon the virtuous as their basis.\n\nThe phrase \"not esteeming\" (不尚) refers to the conduct of arrogance and boasting. If the virtuous are employed, the people will naturally govern themselves; if boasting is employed, grievances and conflicts will arise. Not esteeming boasting will naturally eliminate grievances and conflicts, and not valuing rare and precious goods will make the people without covetousness or theft—thus aligning with the saintly, and with the Dao/Way’s *xuzi* (emptiness), *wuzhi* (non-knowing), and *wuyu* (non-desire), fulfilling the principle of not esteeming.\n\n*Zhang Chongying* (张冲应) replied: \"Pacifying\" (安) means \"governing\" (治), and \"people\" (民) refers to \"humanity\" (人). This chapter speaks of how rulers and great officials reflect upon the Dao/Way, nurturing their own selves, and thus their upright actions and virtuous influence will follow. If the people take *wuwei* (non-action) as their foundation, there will be none who are not governed and pacified.\n\nNot esteeming the virtuous prevents the people from striving in conflict.

what lies beyond one’s natural endowment.\nTo seek what cannot be had is futile—thus they are called difficult to obtain.\nHe who does not rest in his natural allotment,\nbut covets what he lacks,\nhas already strayed from his nature—\nhow can this not be theft?\n\nLet things be used according to their nature,\nand let actions accord with one’s abilities,\nthen rare and difficult-to-obtain goods will lose their allure,\nand the essence of life will not be stolen.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nHumans, upon receiving life, are endowed with a natural portion.\nThe materials and faculties they inherit are their own body and treasure.\nTo seek beyond one’s allotment is futile—\nthus they are called difficult to obtain.\n\nIf one does not abide by his nature,\nbut aspires to brilliance beyond his endowment,\nhe loses his true essence\nand becomes a thief by private inclination.\n\nNow, if the wise and foolish follow their natural inclinations,\nand abilities align with their capacities,\nwith no desire to exceed their portion,\nthey will naturally disregard rare and difficult-to-obtain goods,\nfor they are already content with what they possess—\nwho would then be a thief?\n\nThus, Zhuangzi said:\n*\"The unvirtuous steal the essence of life and glut themselves on wealth and honor.\"*\n\nIt is also explained:\nIf the ruler does not esteem pearls, rhinoceros horn, or precious gems,\nhis governance will be pure and tranquil,\nand the people, transformed by this, will naturally abandon greed.\nEach knowing their sufficiency,\nthey will not become thieves.\n\nDo not present what is desirable,\nso the heart remains undisturbed.\n\nSince there is no pursuit of the virtuous nor coveting of rare goods,\nthere is nothing visibly desirable to incite confusion in the heart.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nTo aspire to brilliance is to see what is desirable—\nwhen desire stirs, how can the heart not be disturbed?\nNow, if one neither elevates ability nor seeks beyond his portion,\nthere will be nothing desirable to provoke confusion in the heart.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThis speaks of the Sage’s governance over the realm and self,\nestablishing it as the foundation of teaching.\nWhat more is there to governance of the realm?\nOnly governance of the self.\n\nThus, empty the heart and fill the belly,\ncut off desire and forget knowledge in *wuwei*,\nand nothing will remain ungoverned.\n\nEmpty the heart.\nWhen the heart is not disturbed by what is desirable, it is empty.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nTo labor the mind after external things is to be obscured by worldly affairs,\nbut to cultivate stillness and preserve purity is to let desires not arise—\nwhen desires do not arise, the heart is empty.\nZhuangzi said: *\"An empty room gives birth to white.\"*—\nmeaning that when the heart is empty, pure clarity arises naturally.\n\nThus it is said:\nEmpty the heart, fill the belly,\nlet virtue and power internally suffuse—\nthen there will be no arrogance or contrivance,\njust as one who eats until satisfied will stop,\ngenerating no further greed.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThe belly, when full, does not crave more;\nwhen virtue and power internally suffuse,\nno greed arises—\nthus it is said, *fill the belly*.\n*\"Eating until satisfied and stopping\"* comes from the *Spring and Autumn Annals*,\nwhere Yan Mo and Ru Kuang advised Duke Wuzi of Wei:\n*\"Use the belly of a commoner to govern the heart of a noble—\nwhen satisfied, there will be no further greed.\"*\n\nWeaken the will.\nWhen the heart is empty, the will grows weak.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThe will is the mind’s affair—\nwhen the mind has something to act upon, it is called will.\nTo let the mind adhere to gentleness and weakness is to know\nthat when the heart is empty, the will weakens.\n\nStrengthen the bones.\nWhen the belly is full, the bones grow strong.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThe bones are the body’s framework.\nSince virtue and power internally suffuse,\nand there is no greed,\nthe belly remains full—\nwhen the belly is full, the bones grow strong.\n\nAlways let the people be without knowledge and without desire.\nAlways let them lack the knowledge of contention and esteem,\nand the desire for acquisition.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThe Sage’s teaching of emptying the heart and filling the belly\nseeks to make the people naturally free from the knowledge of contention\nand the desire for acquisition,\nso they may transform on their own.\n\nLet those who know dare not act.\nThrough tranquil transformation, when knowledge and desire are exhausted,\neven those who possess knowledge will not dare to act.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nThose without knowledge and desire are already tranquil—\nthus, those who possess knowledge will gradually be refined by pure transformation,\ndaring not to act in pursuit of traces or greed,\nbut instead practicing *wuwei*.\n\nTo act in *wuwei* is to govern perfectly.\n\nTo act in *wuwei* while letting people return to their nature,\npure transformation will naturally ensue.\n\n**Commentary (疏):**\nTo act while abiding in *wuwei*—\neven if acting, it is still *wuwei*.\nSince the pursuit of the virtuous is abandoned,\nand rare goods are not sought,\npeople follow their natural portions,\nand things retain their authenticity—\nin *wuwei*, what is there to arrogate or contrive?\nThough without fame or repute,\npeople do not recognize it,\nyet who can say the pure wind does not prevail?\n\nDu Guangting said:\n*\"Not esteeming the virtuous prevents contention.*\n*Pursuing traces*—this means artificiality.\nOnce the principle of esteeming the virtuous arises,\nartificial men will inevitably appear.\nWhy? Because the virtuous are difficult to discern.\nThe cunning feign trustworthiness,\nthe flatterers feign loyalty—\nhow easy is it to distinguish them?\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*'Wisdom produces great deceit.'*\nThus, when the ruler values wisdom,\nthe people respond with deceit;\nwhen the ruler values the virtuous,\nthe people respond with artificiality.\nIt is better to rectify oneself and lead by example,\ngoverning through *wuwei*,\nnurturing with the Great Harmony,\ntransforming through tranquility—\nthen worthy ministers will naturally serve their roles.\n\nThis is what is meant by *clouds following the dragon, winds following the tiger*.\nClouds follow the dragon and winds follow the tiger—\nthis is Confucius’ interpretation of the *Book of Changes*’ *Qian* hexagram,\nwhere the fifth line says: *The flying dragon in the sky.*\nSince it can broadly influence all things,\nwater flows to dampness,\nfire turns to dryness,\nclouds follow the dragon,\nwinds follow the tiger.\nEach follows its kind, responding naturally—\nthis illustrates the Son of Heaven ascending to the fifth position,\nand all under heaven coming to his court.\n\nThe Sage acts, and all things behold him—\nthose rooted in Heaven turn upward,\nthose rooted in Earth turn downward.\nThis speaks of water, which is yin—\nwhen flowing on Earth, it seeks dampness.\nFire, which is yang—\nwhen burning wood, it seeks dryness.\nThough these two things lack awareness or sentiment,\nthey are moved by *qi* and respond thus.\nAgain, the dragon is a water creature,\nand clouds are water *qi*—\nwhen the dragon roars, mist rises.\nThe tiger is a fierce beast,\nand wind is a moving force—\nwhen the tiger howls, valley winds arise.\nThese two things, though possessing awareness and sentiment,\nshare the same *qi* and kind as those without—\nthus they respond in the same way.",

expanding their influence.\n\nEmperor Yao of the Tang dynasty, surnamed Yiqi and named Fangxun,\nwas known as Emperor Tao of the Tang clan.\n\nEmperor Shun of the Yu clan,\na descendant of Zhuanyu, grandson of Qiaoniu,\nson of Guying, born to Mother Yuleng at Yaochu,\nwas thus surnamed Yao and named Zhonghua.\n\nThe eight **Yuan** and eight **Kai** were his ministers.\nIn ancient times, the High Xin (尧) clan had eight talented sons:\nBo Feng, Zhong Kan, Shu Xian, Ji Zhong,\nBo Hu, Zhong Xiong, Shu Bao, Ji Li—\nloyal, solemn, reverent, and harmonious,\nspreading benevolence and grace—\nthe people of all under Heaven called them the eight **Yuan**.\n\nThe High Yang (舜) clan had eight talented sons:\nCang Shu, Tui Gu, Dao Jie, Dai Lin,\nLong Jiang, Ting Jian, Zhong Rong, Shu Da—\nvirtuous and broad-minded, wise and sincere—\nthe people of all under Heaven called them the eight **Kai**.\n\nThese sixteen clans united in their excellence,\nand their renown did not fade.\nYet Yao did not trust them,\nand instead raised Shun as his minister,\nappointed the eight **Yuan** to propagate the Five Teachings to the four quarters,\nand assigned the eight **Kai** to govern the **Hou Tu** (后土, the Earthly Realm).\n\nThe **Tai** and **Heng** (台衡) were the expectations of the Son of Heaven—\nhe established the Three Ministers (三公) to symbolize the Three **Tai** (台, celestial palaces).\nHe did not value rare and difficult treasures,\nso the people did not become thieves.\n\nHuman life originates from the vital essence of Heaven and Earth,\nand those who receive the clear, bright, and pure *qi* become Sages and worthy ones,\nwhile those who receive the turbid, stagnant, and confused *qi* become foolish and lowly.\nThe Sages and worthy ones possess vast divine intelligence,\nwhile the foolish and dim-witted are clouded in ignorance.\nThus, there are inherent differences in human nature.\n\nLaozi said to Confucius:\n*\"The Way generates people and all things,\nand birds, beasts, insects, and all creatures have their odd and even—\nthis refers to differing *qi*.\nBut common people do not know its nature,\nonly those who grasp Dao and virtue can trace its origin.\"*\n\nThe *Wenzi* (文子) says:\n*\"Clear *qi* is Heaven, turbid *qi* is Earth,\nharmonious *qi* is humanity.\nWithin harmonious *qi*, there is brightness and darkness—\nthus, there are the worthy and the foolish.\nIf the foolish seek to emulate the worthy, they exceed their nature—\nthis is called *yue fen* (越分, transgressing one’s limits).\nIf the dark seek to replace the bright, they make false demands—\nthis is called *mang qiu* (妄求, presumptuous desire).\nThis is the act of stealing the essence of life\nand greedily coveting wealth and honor—\nwords from the *Zhuangzi*’s *‘Pianmu’* (骈拇, ‘Extra Thumbs’) chapter.\"*\n\nWealth and honor are coveted because they can be seized,\nbut when there is no higher path to aspire to,\npeople accept their lot,\nacting according to their ability and receiving tasks accordingly—\nhow much less would they transgress their limits\nto greedily steal what is not their due!\n\nA ruler does not value pearls, rhinoceros horns, or rare treasures—\nthis prevents the people from becoming thieves.\nHe does not display what is desirable,\nso his heart remains undisturbed.\nTo covet and admire is to envy brilliance.\n\nHuman nature is limited,\nyet to envy wisdom is to transgress one’s nature—\nthis is called *desire* (欲).\n\nAgain, those who cultivate the Dao,\nin their early stages,\nthough their practice is incomplete,\ntheir refinement not yet mature,\nfear what is desirable,\nbeing drawn by the realm of phenomena—\nthus, they retreat into mountains and forests,\navoiding the clamor of the world.\nBut when their hearts are tranquil and their wills steadfast,\nthe realm cannot entice them—\nthey move through the day with ease,\nnever wearying.\nThis is the saying:\n*\"Small retreat in the mountains, great retreat in the marketplace.\"*\n\nUnable to sever desire,\nfearing the pull of phenomena,\nthey hide in mountains and forests to avoid what they see—\nuntil their hearts are purified and their thoughts still,\ntheir minds dwell on the true and genuine,\nfree from external disturbances,\npreserving inner serenity—\neven amidst the bustling markets,\nname and gain do not touch their hearts;\neven amidst the worldly paths,\ncontroversies do not disrupt their intentions.\nMingling with the city,\nhow does this harm the cultivation of the genuine?\n\nThus, the Sage’s principle:\n*\"The True and Perfect Man said to the Yellow Emperor:\n‘I have never heard of a man who cultivates his body\nyet fails to bring order to his state.’\nThe body of one man is a microcosm of his state—\nthe chest and abdomen are like palaces and halls,\nthe four limbs like boundaries and territories,\nthe bones and joints like officials.\nThe spirit is like the ruler,\nthe blood like the ministers,\nand the *qi* like the people.\nTo govern the body is to govern the state—\nloving the people secures the state,\ncherishing the *qi* preserves the body.\nIf the people scatter, the state falls;\nif the *qi* is exhausted, life dies.\nWhat has fallen cannot be restored,\nwhat is dead cannot be revived—\nthus, the Perfect Man extinguishes breath before it arises,\nand treats ailments before they manifest.\n*Qi* is difficult to nurture yet easily corrupted,\nthe people are hard to gather yet easily dispersed—\ngovernance must begin before chaos arises,\nnot after it has already passed.\"*\n\n**Reflect upon this!**\n\n**Empty your heart.**\nOnly when the Dao gathers in emptiness does emptiness embrace the Dao.\nWhen the Dao gathers in the heart,\nthe spirit plays with transformation,\nthe heart communicates with Heaven,\nand all things spontaneously transform below—\nthe Sage rests in harmony above.\nThis is the ultimate principle of governance.\n\n*\"The empty room produces whiteness\"*—\nwords from the *Zhuangzi*’s *‘Renjian Shijie’* (人间世, ‘The World of Man’) chapter.\nThe room is the heart—\nto see what is present as if it were absent is to empty the heart.\nWhen the heart is emptied,\npure whiteness naturally arises.\nPure whiteness is the appearance of great clarity and openness.\n\nThe *Inner Observation Scripture* (内观经) says:\n*\"The heart is neither green nor

In the middle of the meal, they reproached themselves, saying, 'Should the General’s food be deemed insufficient?'—thus the second sigh.

The belly is easily filled, yet the mind is hard to satisfy—this was their desire to curb his greed and not accept the tribute from Gěngyáng.

Let those who possess knowledge dare not act.\n\nWhen the lower follows the upper, it is like the wind bending the grass—pure and harmonious, universally permeating, all returning to the state of *non-action*. To act in *non-action* is to have nothing left ungoverned.\n\nThe principle of *non-action* is vast indeed! *Non-action* does not mean withdrawing so that nothing comes, or pushing so that nothing stays, or forcing so that there is no response, or moving so that nothing shifts, or being rigid and stagnant so that nothing flows, or being coiled and damp so that nothing scatters.\n\nIt means that private desires do not intrude upon the public Dao, that appetites do not pervert proper methods. To act in accordance with principle, to establish merit through resources, to complete deeds without self-praise, to achieve feats without claiming renown—this is *non-action*.\n\nIf water is used with a boat, sand with a cart, mud with a sled, and mountains with a wheelbarrow, if one cultivates summer fields and winter ponds, follows elevation for tillage and depression for reservoirs, then this is not what I call *action*—it is *non-action*.\n\nThe *non-action* of the Sage follows naturally, relies upon the people, demands without toil, plans without error, acts without omission. Their words are refined as writings, their deeds as models, their advancement and retreat suit the times, their movement and stillness follow principle. They neither favor beauty nor detest ugliness, nor do their rewards and punishments stem from personal likes or dislikes. Each has their own appointed name, each fulfills their own proper function. Matters arise from nature itself, without deviation from the self. They conform to Heaven’s timing, adapt to Earth’s traits, and follow humanity’s inclinations.\n\nThus, ministers gather like spokes to a wheel, the worthy and unworthy each employing their talents. The ruler gains means to govern his ministers, the ministers gain means to serve their ruler—this is the Dao of *non-action* in governing the realm.\n\nThe unheard and unscented is the *Shijing* [Book of Songs]—[大雅] [Great Odes]—[文王篇] [Wenwang’s Chapter]. It speaks of Heaven’s Dao being difficult to know: the ears do not hear its sounds, the nose does not perceive its fragrances.

Valuing wealth brings many desires, to the point where daylight thefts occur, and robbers lurk even at midday.\n\nNot exalting the worthy means the people each settle into their own appointed nature and fate, without striving to surpass others, hence they do not contend.\n\nNot valuing wealth means the people each find contentment in their own natural inclinations and fates, without coveting what they do not possess, hence they do not become thieves.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Trim the deeds of the Ru historians, and muzzle the mouths of Yang and Mo.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The virtue/power of the world thus begins to return to its original unity.\n\n*The Traveling Wolf* says: *\"Do not exalt the strange and devalue the useful; only then will the people be content. Do not show them what is desirable, lest their hearts be disordered.\"*\n\nWhen people have desires, they will even contest their very nature and fate—plundering, deceiving, and committing every outrage. Boyi, seeing the allure of fame, starved to death beneath Chief Yang’s hill; Zhi, seeing the lure of profit, met his end on Dongling’s heights. Their passions burned like wildfire, their coldness froze like ice, and so their hearts were shattered, reckless, and uncontrollable.\n\nYet the Sage does not pursue profit, does not shun harm, does not rejoice in longevity, nor lament early death. He does not prize advancement nor despise obscurity. Then what is there to desire? When desires do not arise, my heart is serene. When stirred, it responds; when still, it is unobstructed. In motion, it does not chase; at rest, it does not resist. What can disturb it?\n\nConfucius was forty and free from doubt; Mencius, forty and no longer troubled in heart—both had attained this.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance aims to keep the people in a state of *wu zhi* (無知) and *wu yu* (無欲). The valley is empty and thus responsive; the mirror is empty and thus reflective. The gourd is empty and thus can receive; the ear is empty and thus can hear; the eye is empty and thus can see; the nose is empty and thus can smell. If filled, they become obstructed.\n\nThe Sage, when compelled to govern the world, treats all with equal benevolence, strengthens the near while uplifting the distant, follows what is natural, and lets things unfold of their own accord—what need for scheming? Yao’s elevation of Shun and execution of Gun nearly achieved this.\n\nWhen the heart is empty, it listens impartially and observes without bias, free from likes and dislikes. When the belly is full, the mind is content and at ease, free from greed. Why exalt the worthy or blame the unworthy?\n\nThe Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes. The belly, unselective, can contain all. The will is the mind’s knowledge; the bones are the body’s foundation. A strong will may lead one to relentlessly pursue fame or wealth, to boast of one’s abilities or flaunt one’s achievements—ever farther from the Mysterious Dao. Weak bones cause erratic movement, clashing with others until one is exhausted and cannot return.\n\nThe Sage’s will is ever humble, yet others exalt him. Ever yielding, yet others honor him first. Knowing strength, he embraces weakness; knowing glory, he embraces disgrace. This is called weakening the will to still it—nothing can then displace it. Firmly grasping it, nothing can overturn it. The unbroken essence, like that of Guangchengzi, lived twelve hundred years without decay—this is called strengthening the bones.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"In harmony with the unknowing, virtue does not depart. In harmony with desirelessness, this is called pristine simplicity. Pristine simplicity, and the people’s nature is preserved.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s governance seeks only to let the people preserve their nature. Excessive knowledge disrupts the appointed nature and fate; excessive desire drowns their natural inclinations. This is called governance, yet what chaos is greater?\n\nThus it is said: *\"Keep the people in a state of wu zhi and wu yu, so that the learned dare not act, the eloquent dare not speak, the brave dare not display their strength, the capable dare not boast of their talents, the clever dare not scheme, and those who pride themselves on cleverness and cunning dare not multiply laws to exploit the people.\"* The Sage prohibits and stops all this—this is called *\"the learned dare not act.\"*\n\nWhen the Nine Virtues are fully cultivated and the talented are in their proper offices, is this not because knowledge is not prized? Simply executing the ruler’s commands and delivering them to the people—then there is nothing that cannot be governed.\n\nThe Sage’s governance is not about abandoning people and things, suddenly standing alone in a realm of non-action. It is about acting from non-action.\n\nThe transformations of all things occur in the realm of the manifest. The Sage embodies the Dao, standing above all things, unifying their completion, and ordering them. Things arise; follow them to observe their return. Things are born; guide them to their fulfillment. How could there be anything ungoverned?\n\nWhen governance is supreme, the sun, moon, and stars follow their courses. When governance is supreme below, birds, beasts, grasses, and trees each fulfill their nature.\n\nWang Anshi said: *\"Not exalting the worthy prevents contention among the people.\"* Discussing what is meant by *\"not exalting the worthy\"*:\n\nThe Sage’s heart has never sought to subdue the world through the worthy, yet the world submits to him—never without the worthy. If the people of the world are made to serve the world’s affairs, and the worthy are not exalted, then what reliance is there for governance?\n\nThe people, even in infancy, possess a natural inclination toward goodness. If they are not taught by the worthy, they cannot fully illuminate the world’s goodness. Once goodness is clear within oneself, how could the worthy not be revered? Thus, even if the laws and institutions remain, they are sufficient to restrain later chaos. If the worthy are exalted throughout the world, how could the people contend?\n\nHis intent is to make all under heaven clearly understand goodness, yet he does not advocate exalting the worthy. Still, the world is not so uniformly equal, and if the laws of exalting the worthy are abandoned, people may not necessarily understand goodness. Alas, the worthy cannot alone remedy the flaws of the unworthy—who knows the worthy who can make all under heaven sincerely and willingly submit?\n\nQi Huan Gong asked Guan Zhong: *\"If I, alas, reach a point of no return, to whom should I entrust the state?\"* Qi Huan Gong favored Yi Ya, but Guan Zhong said that Yi Ya, whom he did not often consult, was not as loyal as Xi Peng. If one elevates those who forget their superiors and rebel below, what greater harm from exalting the worthy could there be?\n\nSome may say: *\"Is this not what he means? He merely argues against its drawbacks.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Sage above does not prize rare and hard-to-obtain goods to the point of disturbing the heart. To exalt the worthy sparks contention; rare goods provoke theft. Both arise from what the heart desires. Thus, the Sage in governance does not command people to exalt the worthy or prize rare goods. If these two things are unseen, then the heart alone may remain undisturbed.\n\nTo exalt the worthy is good, but to prize rare goods invites theft—evil. Why reject both? For good and evil are opposites. Where there is good, there is also its opposite; both must be made to vanish.\n\nThere are two kinds of desire in the world: the desirable desire and the undesirable desire. As Mencius says, the desirable is called good—yet the eye’s delight in color, the ear’s in sound, the nose’s in scent—these are undesirable desires.\n\n*The Explanation of Characters* states: *\"谷 (gǔ) can receive; 欠 (qiàn) signifies lack.\"* That which can receive and endure, yet is not full—this is desire. Laozi says: *\"Do not exalt the worthy, lest the people contend. Do not prize rare goods, lest the people steal. Do not display the desirable, lest the heart be disturbed.\"* These are Laozi’s one-sided, unbalanced words.\n\nThe ancient kings neither exalted the worthy nor despised it; neither prized rare goods nor rejected them; neither displayed the desirable nor concealed it. Yet Laozi’s words speak of the formless Dao: not exalting the worthy prevents burdening oneself with goodness; not prizing rare goods prevents burdening oneself with profit. Only thus can one remain undisturbed by the desirable.\n\nMencius said: *\"The desirable is called good.\"* When goodness accumulates and fills to the divine, reaching this divine state, one no longer sees the desirable. Thus, the Sage’s governance strengthens the bones.\n\nTo empty the heart is to clarify that the worthy are not exalted; to fill the belly is to show that rare goods are not prized; to strengthen the bones is to demonstrate that the desirable is unseen.\n\nThe hearts of people differ in worthiness and unworthiness. If one exalts worthiness and unworthiness, contention arises. Thus, emptying the heart erases the distinction between worthy and unworthy, and so the worthy are not exalted. The belly, which can receive, if filled, makes rare goods mere trifles of food, sound, and color. All that is desirable becomes desire itself. Weakening the will prevents seeking; strengthening the bones ensures stability. Only by having no desires does one not see the desirable, yet remain steadfast. To have no desires yet stand firm—this is what the noble value.\n\nIf one constantly makes the people ignorant and desireless, empties their hearts, weakens their wills, and fills their bellies while strengthening their bones, the people will have no knowledge or desires. Even the wise will dare not act. If all the people are without knowledge or desire, even the wise among them will not dare to act. To act without action is to govern without fail. To act yet do nothing, to do nothing yet achieve all—this is the Sage’s way of *wuwei*, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nSu Yingbin said: *\"Not exalting the worthy prevents contention; strengthening the bones is the end.\"* If the worthy are exalted, the people will shame themselves for not measuring up and thus contend. If rare goods are prized, the people will suffer from lack and thus steal. If the desirable is displayed, the people will suffer from not obtaining it and thus rebel. Yet though the world knows these three as afflictions, if one seeks to abolish them outright, it is delusion.\n\nThe Sage does not act thus. Though the worthy are used, they are not exalted; though rare goods exist, they are not prized; though desirable things are present, they are not displayed. Thus, the worthy are employed yet the people do not contend; rare goods and desirable matters are before them, yet theft and chaos do not arise. Is this not the result of emptying the heart yet not filling the belly, weakening the will yet not harming the bones?\n\nNow, if one were to exalt and display the worthy, treasure and prize goods, and flaunt the desirable, then both heart and belly would be filled. If one were to abolish them outright, then will and bones would weaken. When heart and belly are full, the people contend. When will and bones are weak, there is no foundation to stand upon.\n\nIf one constantly makes the people ignorant and desireless to the point where they dare not act, and does not flaunt these three things, then the people will know nothing to covet, their desires will be tranquil, and even the clever will have no schemes. To act without action is to govern without fail. This is to follow the natural course of these three things while neither exalting, prizing, nor displaying them—this is *wuwei*.\n\nLü Jifu said: *\"Not exalting the worthy prevents contention.\"* The Sage knows that beauty is also ugliness, goodness also ungoodness, yet holds no private favor. Though he bestows all under heaven’s titles, he simply assigns duties, and the worthy are not exalted. The people’s contention always arises from comparing themselves to others in worthiness. Knowing the worthy are not exalted by the ruler, they do not contend.\n\n*\"Not prizing rare goods prevents theft.\"* Gathering all under heaven’s wealth is merely to nourish the people, yet rare goods are not prized. The people’s theft always arises from greed. Knowing goods are not prized by the ruler, they do not steal.\n\n*\"Not displaying the desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.\"* Confucius said: *\"If a man does not desire it, even if rewarded, he will not steal.\"* The desires of the noble are for the worthy alone.",

If one elevates those who forget their superiors and rebel below, what greater harm from exalting the worthy could there be?\n\nSome may say: *\"Is this not what he means? He merely argues against its drawbacks.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Sage’s Dao is empty and natural, beyond contrivance.\nTo contrive is to ruin it; to grasp is to lose it—\nThus the wise dare not act at all.\n\nTo act without acting,\nThen what is done arises from non-action,\nAnd the marvelous workings of Nature\nLeave nothing untended.\n\nThis is what Zhuangzi called:\n*\"Let the heart wander in simplicity,\nMerge the qi with emptiness,\nFollow things in their natural course,\nAnd harbor no private schemes—\nThen the world is governed,\nFor it has attained the Dao’s boundless, void-like power.\"*\n\nThus, the next step is to align with the Dao’s path.\n\nZhao Shiyuan remarked:\n*\"First, do not employ clever stratagems.\nOne: Eliminate rhetoric and sophistry.\nDo not exalt the worthy, lest the people contend.\"*\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of the Sage’s non-action governing the world,\nYet when the work is done and not claimed,\nIt is the true, eternal function at play.\nHow could it rely on external force?\n\nThus, the Sage is not necessarily transcendent—\nFor there is no such thing as the Sage.\nThe wise are not discarded—\nFor there is no such thing as wisdom.\nOnly emptiness of mind remains.\n\nObserve the Three Dynasties onward—\nNo one spoke of non-action.\nThus, they packed provisions for a thousand-li journey,\nSought worthy advisors to plan governance.\n\nLaozi lamented their failure to grasp the root,\nSo he followed with *\"Do not exalt the worthy.\"*\n\nTo entrust great matters does not mean entrusting small ones.\nTo be a Sage does not mean being merely worthy.\nThe great embodies the Dao’s non-action—\nThis is the Sage’s affair.\nThe small relies on cleverness and boasting—\nThis is the worthy’s affair.\n\nThus, the great Sage acts,\nGoverned by non-action’s root,\nLetting the people each find their natural state,\nAnd severing the hearts of ambition, rivalry, and contention.\n\nAs the *Yijing* says:\n*\"The Way of Heaven’s transformation—\nEach returns to their true nature.\"*\n\nWhen nature is rectified,\nIt remains pure and constant,\nWith no scheming mind—\nThen who could distinguish the worthy from the unworthy?\n\nIf I wish for non-action,\nI dull their ears and eyes;\nIf I wish for governance,\nI unify their sincere hearts.\n\nWhen cleverness arises, deceit follows;\nWhen cunning intentions form, contention stirs.\nWhen these shift,\nHow could they surpass governance?\n\nThe middle way of human nature can rise or fall—\nGuided by the Dao, it returns to purity;\nLured by the worthy, it advances to contention.\nContention breeds contention—\nThe people’s nature shifts.\n\nThough one might exalt the worthy,\nYet forbidding the people from knowing too much\nIs not the same as nurturing true understanding,\nNor is it the same as teaching falsehood as virtue.\n\nThus, *\"Do not exalt the worthy\"*—\nThis is the operation of the most divine.\n\nIn the ancient times, rulers heard no mention of ministers.\nEven the succession of Xīn and Nóng had none.\nYet when Huangdi fought at Yǒuqí,\nWind Master and Strength Master first appeared as ministers,\nAnd when asked about governance,\nHe had More Area and Qi Bo as teachers.\nLater, though the Sage’s Way still lingered,\nThe demand for assistance grew urgent.\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"South has fine fish—\nThen music and the worthy are cherished.\"*\n*\"South Mountain has a terrace—\nThen music and the worthy are rejoiced in.\"*\nYet in *\"The Simple One,\"*\nIt criticizes the neglect of the worthy.\n*\"In the Hills There Is Hemp\"*\nCriticizes the exile of the worthy.\n*\"The Sly Boy\"*\nCriticizes not consulting the worthy in affairs.\nThus, when Great Simplicity had scattered,\nThe worthy could not be neglected.\n\nLaozi, in the declining Zhou,\nWished to restore purity and return to simplicity,\nSo he spoke of *\"not exalting the worthy.\"*\nNot for any other reason—\nLet the people be pure and simple, and they will not contend;\nLet the people value things lightly, and they will not covet.\n\nIn all, it was to remedy the ills of his time.\n\nThus, exalting the worthy and employing the capable\nWere the ancient kings’ establishment of proper rites, morality, laws, and institutions.\nNot exalting the worthy, not employing the capable—\nLaozi sought quietude and non-action.\n\nThough their paths differed,\nTheir governance was one.\n\nThus, carrying a jar to water the garden,\nAnswering Zǐgōng’s inquiry;\nPlowing fields without seeking office,\nFleeing Bóchéng’s pursuit.\nAnd *\"Horsehoof\"* and *\"The Thief\"*—\nAll were scorned by the common people.\n\nTwo: Eliminate love of gain.\nDo not prize hard-to-obtain goods,\nLest the people become thieves.\nDo not exalt the worthy,\nLest the people contend.\nDo not display desirable things,\nLest the heart be disordered.\n\nThis passage is called *\"The Three Laws of Mysterious Unity.\"*\nThe first two sentences speak of governance;\nThe last speaks of self-cultivation.\n\nFirst, master the way of self-cultivation,\nThen one may govern the people.\n\nTo govern is to rectify—\nRectified, there is no deviation;\nNo deviation, there is no desire;\nNo desire, the heart is empty;\nAn empty heart does not stray;\nWhen none stray, all things submit;\nWhen all submit, clever schemes are unnecessary.\n\nWhat need is there for the worthy?\n\nGoods are exchanged for mutual benefit,\nAnd sustenance for self and others is complete—\nThough gold and jade may be prized,\nThey cannot fill hunger.\nGuided by the Dao, each receives their due,\nWithout letting the low usurp the high,\nOr the poor overpower the rich.\nIf there is competition,\nThen nature’s true state is violated,\nAnd they boast of strange, extravagant things.\n\nThis must lie in the ruler’s reverence for simplicity,\nNot indulging in splendor.\nWhen the people of the world transform without coercion,\nLike Han Wen’s return of the thousand-li horse,\nOr Jin Wu’s burning of the pheasant-feather robe,\nThen the world’s love of goods is already stirred.\n\nThus, perfect governance does not rely on the three treasures.\n\nHanzi said:\n*\"The essential Way resides in the four cardinal virtues.\"*\nJia Yi’s extreme argument:\n*\"Cultivate the self with no desire,\nThen the mind has no affairs—\nNo affairs, then tranquility arises.\"*\n\nThus, the clever dare not boast of their wisdom,\nThe capable dare not boast of their talents—\nWho could then cater to their preferences?\n\nFormer rulers did not embody the ultimate Way,\nBut sought to outdo others with desires,\nAnd deceitful ministers gained favor by indulging them—\nNone escaped ruin through this path.\n\nTai Jia said:\n*\"Desire destroys measures, enslaves the ears and eyes—\nThis is what desire does.\"*\nDuke Zou also said:\n*\"Following desire is called the Way—\nExhausting it utterly.\"*\n\nIf one follows what others desire,\nWithout restraint or limit,\nThen the world’s Way is exhausted by indulgence.\n\nThe Sage’s governance—\nIf one can eliminate desire and empty the heart,\nThen the divine mind shines brightly,\nKnowing the four directions is not far.",

      "translated_text": "**III. Rectifying Nature and Emotions**\n\nTo see nothing desirable,\nSo that the heart remains undisturbed.\nThis means not letting any single thing weigh upon the heart—\nThen the heart itself will be without attachment.\n\nWhen one speaks of \"seeing,\" it is not merely seeing with the eyes.\nThe six senses all perceive;\nFrom perception arises desire,\nAnd excessive desire disturbs the heart—\nThe heart is inherently impure.\n\nNow, the eye is the foremost of the six senses.\nThough called the \"seeing root,\" the eye itself perceives,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing* (境).\nThough the ear is said to \"listen,\" listening is truly a form of seeing,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.\nThough the nose is said to \"smell,\" smelling is truly a form of seeing,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.\nThough the tongue is said to \"taste,\" tasting is truly a form of seeing,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.\nThough the body is said to \"touch,\" touching is truly a form of seeing,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.\nThough the mind is said to \"discern,\" discernment is truly a form of seeing,\nAnd what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.\n\nThis is called the six senses (*liùgēn* 六根).\nThe six senses generate six dusts (*liùchén* 六塵),\nAnd the six dusts correspond to six *jing*s—\nThis is called the thirty-six *jie* (界) and eighty-one *lún* (輪) of rebirth,\nThe causal conditions of birth and death.\n\nThough the objects of awareness differ,\nThey are all called *awareness*.\nThough the objects of perception differ,\nThey are all called *perception*.\n\nThe six desires arise from the same mind,\nAnd from the mind’s tendencies,\nThe three realms are but a single *shi* (識).\n\nThe six senses take in *jing*s,\nStoring them in the mind—\nThe mind itself is the *zang* (藏) of *shi*.\nThe six senses are called the six *shi*,\nWith seven added above, totaling eight.\n\nThe seven *shi* are those that,\nFor the six *shi*, manage their functions and return to the eighth *shi*,\nAlso called *yi* (意).\nThe eighth *shi* holds the three *zang* (能藏, 所藏, 藏执),\nAnd depends on all defiled and pure *dharma*s—\nThus it is called *zǐ* (種子).\n\nThe seven and eight *shi* are both called *yi* or *xin* (心).\nThus, the six desires defile and disturb one’s true nature—\nNature is the birth of the heart,\nAnd the heart is the true nature itself.\n\nFrom beginningless time,\nYou have prevented me from returning to the true Dao,\nBecause of your six *shi*’s insatiable grasping,\nCausing this heart to ceaselessly labor,\nChasing the winds of love,\nNever pausing in its frenzy.\n\nBetween looking up and down,\nIt flutters beyond the four seas,\nLike a lamp flame in the wind, never still—\nThus, like disordered threads in the wind,\nIt cannot be tamed.\n\nWhen the heart is not mastered,\nIt follows *jing*s endlessly,\nTurning without rest,\nExhausting the spirit,\nDaily drifting into delusion,\nTransforming into strange forms,\nWith no way to return to its origin.\n\nHow grave is desire’s harm to nature—\nShould one not be cautious?\n\nFor desire was not accumulated in a single day,\nNor was nature defiled in a single day—\nWithin lies *wúmíng* (無明), ruling as master.\nFrom beginningless time until now,\nEven from the moment of entering the womb,\nArising from impure *jing*s,\nKarma and retribution are the cause,\nAnd love gives birth.\n\nFrom the moment of entering the womb,\nLove is already present,\nAnd within love lies desire,\nWhich gives rise to this heart.\nBy the time of infancy,\nThough emotions are not yet fully awakened,\nJoy and anger already stir within the heart.\n\nSwiftly, one begins to distinguish affairs,\nAnd the six desires arise,\nSplitting into six *chù* (處),\nUsing one *jing* to receive,\nDesire generating one mind—\nSince the arising *jing*s are boundless,\nThe mind is also boundless.\n\nYet this single mind\nDoes not know where it dwells—\nFor desire prevails, and the heart is disordered.\n\nThus, the three realms’ first six heavens\nAre called the *yùjiè* (欲界).\nThe first, the *Tàihuáng Yǔngzēng Tiān* (太皇黄曾天人),\nHas all six sense-desires defiled.\nThe *Tàimíng Yùwán Tiān* (太明玉完天人),\nHas one sense-desire coarse and pure,\nAnd five coarse and defiled.\nThe *Qīngmíng Hétóng Tiān* (清明何童天人),\nHas two sense-desires coarse and pure,\nAnd four coarse and defiled.\nThe *Xuāntāi Píngyù Tiān* (玄胎平育天人),\nHas three sense-desires coarse and pure,\nAnd three coarse and defiled.\nThe *Míngwén Jǔ Tiān* (明文举天人),\nHas four sense-desires coarse and pure,\nAnd two coarse and defiled.\nThe *Shàngmíng Qīyào Tiān* (上明七曜天人),\nHas five sense-desires coarse and pure,\nAnd one coarse and defiled.\n\nThese six heavens are called the *yùjiè*.\nThe *Tàizhēn Kē* (太真科) says:\nThe first two heavens below are still coarse in retribution,\nWhere even bodily contact is desire.\nThe next two heavens take hand-holding as desire,\nThe fifth takes speech as desire,\nAnd the sixth takes mere sight as desire.\n\nNow, through these six desires,\nOne feels these six heavens.\nFor each sense-desire that is coarse and pure,\nOne ascends to a higher heaven.\nWhen all six desires are transcended,\nOne enters the *sèjiè* (色界).\n\nOnly then does nature fully dissolve,\nAnd one ascends to the *wúsèjiè* (無色界) heavens.\nWhen called \"without color,\" it means \"without desire.\"\n\nIndeed, at the start of cultivation,\nEliminating desire is difficult.\nFrom the six realms to becoming human,\nFrom the human path to sainthood,\nThe gate of transcendence is gradually consumed.\n\nThe *Sutra* says: *\"Few desires, little selfishness,\"*\nThe *Yì* (易) says: *\"Restrain anger, suppress desire.\"*\nThe *Sutra* speaks of gradual refinement,\nThe *Yì* speaks of reduction.\n\nThough scholars cultivate thus,\nThose who harmonize with things like flowing water,\nWithout arising in thought to sever them—\nWithout roots, who has dust?\nWithout dust, who has *jing*s?\nUnderstanding this,\nOne becomes a true person.\n\n**Next, the Essentials of Governance**\n\n**1. [Rectifying the foundation of governance]**\nThus, the Sage’s governance—\nThe first three sentences expound the three methods of profound meaning,\nThe last four sentences establish the four affairs of governance.\n\nThe character *shì* (是以) connects what follows,\nMeaning the Sage understands these three principles,\nAnd practices *xūxīn shífù* (虛心實腹),\n*ruòzhì qiánggǔ* (弱志強骨)—\nThus, the Sage’s path is clearly articulated.\n\nTo not exalt the worthy is to eliminate cleverness and wisdom;\nTo not treasure wealth is to eliminate rare and strange things;",

      "translated_text": "To see no desirable things, one’s heart finds peace.\nThese three principles form the foundation of governance.\nWithout this foundation, how can one seek stability?\n\nThe art of kingship has long been practiced.\nThese three principles, even the Sage has often heard them.\nTo hear them is to resolve to act upon them,\nAnd their enactment lies in the four affairs.\n\nThus, Zengzi said:\nTo honor what one has heard brings clarity and brilliance,\nTo act upon what one knows brings radiance and grandeur.\nWhat is meant by grandeur is to enact these four affairs:\nThe first is to empty the heart,\nThe second is to fill the belly,\nThe third is to weaken the will,\nThe fourth is to strengthen the bones.\n\n**2. [The Depth of Emptiness]**\n**Emptying the Heart**\nEmptying the heart has four interpretations—three are false, one is true.\nThe first three are incorrect; the fourth alone is correct.\n\nThe first says: *\"Like the emptiness of boundless space.\"*\nThe second says: *\"Like the emptiness of a hollow valley.\"*\nThe third says: *\"Like the emptiness of a tiger on a hill.\"*\nThe fourth says: *\"To regard *One* as emptiness.\"*\n\nThe emptiness of boundless space, of hollow valleys, of a tiger on a hill—\nThese are all incorrect.\nThey cannot be likened to the void of *One*.\nFor if one’s heart is as empty as boundless space,\nEven the solitary awakened may weary of vexation,\nAnd though they bear no burden in their minds,\nSitting to observe the void—\nThe void stretches endlessly, yet nothing can be done.\nHow could the Sage of governance guard such emptiness as true emptiness?\nThis is the first error.\n\nAgain, if one takes the emptiness of a hollow valley as emptiness,\nIt is but a mountain’s hollowed-out cavern.\nThe valley’s resonance echoes with emptiness,\nAnd when sound arises, it too is empty—\nThe two emptinesses merge, and only then do they respond.\nThough this may seem a fine metaphor,\nScripture says: *\"The spirit of the valley does not die.\"*\nWhen we speak of the spirit of the valley,\nWe mean there is a spirit within the valley—\nNot merely an empty hollow.\nIf the valley had no spirit,\nWhat then would be this so-called divine essence?\nWhen I call and it responds in harmony,\nCould there be governance without a leader to initiate it?\nIf there is no leader yet harmony exists,\nThis is unnatural.\nThus, the emptiness of a valley cannot compare\nTo the Sage’s heart of governance.\nThis is the second error.\n\n*The Book of Characters* says: *\"Empty, and the hill becomes empty.\"*\nEmpty, and none dare approach.\nThe affairs of the king encompass the world as one family,\nNot favoring only his kin,\nNot cherishing only his children—\nAll are to be loved and benefited,\nUntil all under heaven turn toward him.\nCould this be likened to a tiger’s isolation on a hill,\nSevering all to create emptiness?\nThis is the third error.\n\nNow, what is spoken of as *One* is indeed emptiness.\n*One* is solid when in *Kàn* (坎), empty when in *Lì* (离).\nWater and fire generate each other—\nThe movement of spirit and essence\nCannot for an instant be separated.\nThus, the Sage’s movement of spirit and the workings of the heart\nFollow the unfathomable patterns of water and fire—\n*One* is their origin.\nThe Dao produces *One*, and *One* is emptiness,\nNot generating yet the source of all generation,\nWithout use yet the ancestor of all utility.\n*One* is the sovereign—\nIn the *Xiàng* (象), three strokes form *Qián* (乾),\nAnd three threes, two twos—\nThe three powers transform and adapt.\nFrom *One* to three, to six,\nUp to the three hundred eighty-four lines—\n*One* encompasses all.\n\n*One* is the divine.\nTo respond to emptiness with emptiness is useless—\nYet is it truly useless?\nThe Sage’s Way enslaves others without being enslaved,\nCommands things without being commanded—\n*One* without a second,\nMastering fate.\nThe *Han Stratagems* say: *\"Fate\"*—\nOnly the Sage can enact it.\n*One* without disorder is the utmost stillness.\nStillness without change is the constant of the Way.\nChange without change is the function of the Way.\nWhen things change and I remain still, I guard *One*.\nWhen I remain still and things move, I observe their return.\nThus, *One* is non-action,\nYet non-action is not non-doing.\nThe sovereign’s heart penetrates the Three Mysteries,\nEnacting the four affairs—\nWho would say emptiness and non-being are not governance?\nThis is the truth of *One* as emptiness.\n\n**3. [The Dao is Fully *Qián*]**\n**Filling the Belly**\nThe eight trigrams regard *Kùn* (坤) as the belly,\nFor it transforms into the five materials—\nOn earth, forming shape, *Kùn* is the storehouse,\nThus it is called the belly.\nAgain, the back is *yáng* (阳), the belly is *yīn* (阴),\nAnd since it governs storage,\nIt holds what has passed—\nThus, it is the belly.\n\nEarth governs intention, issuing forth as new,\nReturning as what has passed—\nAll govern storage.\nBecause it holds much, it is called *filling the belly*.\n\nAgain, observing the two symbols *Kàn* (坎) and *Lì* (离),\n*Kàn* is filled within—\nIt bears the symbol of a filled belly,\n*Lì* is empty in heart—\nIt bears the symbol of an empty heart.\n*Kàn* is firm, *Lì* is yielding—\nThus, the heart and belly are firm and yielding.\n\nScripture says: *\"Man follows Earth,\"*\nAnd the *Yì* says: *\"The way of standing on Earth is yielding and firm.\"*\nYet what is solid without emptiness to permeate it\nLacks divinity,\nThus it is said: *\"Yellow Center, the harmony of principles.\"*\nIf emptiness does not tread upon solidity,\nIt cannot reach the pure, clear, awakened state.\n\nThe Commentary says:\nAn empty heart listens impartially and observes without bias,\nFree of likes and dislikes—\nThis is the birth of clarity.\n*Lì* is fire, the fire of enlightenment—\nThe Sage faces south to govern the world.\nA filled belly is abundant and tranquil,\nWithout covetous desires,\nIts capacity is public—\n*Kùn* is the belly, and the belly governs receptivity—\nThe Sage’s central rectitude in observing the world is thus.\n\nWhat was previously discussed—\nEmptying the heart, filling the belly—\nReveals the Sage’s governance in action.\n\nThe functions of emptiness and fullness\nIn humans are affairs,\nIn the trigrams are *Kàn* and *Lì*,\nIn *qi* are *yīn* and *yáng*.\nTheir application in human affairs is as described,\nYet their application in *Kàn* and *Lì* differs in law.\n\nMoreover, *yáng* is full, *yīn* is empty—\nThe alchemical method refines the two *bā* (八) of *yīn*,\nExtending the nine *sān* (三) of *yáng*—\nWhen *yáng* is pure, one becomes immortal;\nWhen *yīn* is pure, one dies.\n*Kàn*’s interior and exterior are *yīn*,\n*Lì*’s interior and exterior are *yáng*—\nFire above, water below is *Unfinished* (未济),\nDescending fire to meet water is *Completed* (既济).",

*yáng*?\n\nTo follow Heaven and Earth’s *yīn* and *yáng*\nIs yet to have not attained the method of *zhì* (制).\nOne cannot but drift along with *zào huà* (造化),\nNot knowing that the power to govern life lies within oneself.\n\nThe Dao of *yīn* and *yáng*:\nTo follow it leads to death,\nTo oppose it leads to life.\n\nThe Master of Taibai said:\n*\"Five Phases in Reverse—*\n*The Dragon emerges from fire.*\n*Five Phases not in order—*\n*The Tiger is born in water.*\nThis is opposition—\nOpposition brings life.\"\n\nThe *Tàishàng* (太上) speaks thus:\n*\"Water and fire align with the true

of desire.\n\nObserve how many scholars of the Dao there are in the world—\nSome know it, yet cannot guard it;\nGuard it, yet cannot act upon it.\nThere is no other reason—\nFor the heart’s desire for gain overpowers,\nAnd the Way of clarity and emptiness becomes difficult to return to.\n\nStrengthen the will yet weaken the bones—\nLike hoarding wealth without trade,\nShutting doors to guard it,\nYet unable to exchange it—\nHow then could one grow rich?\n\n**Commentary:** *\"The bones grow strong, yet their movement scatters and shifts—*\n*This is to say there is no steadiness below.\"*\n\nOnly those who persist in self-strengthening\nCan truly embody this.\n\nThe Three Governments’ teachings reach far—\nEver making the people without knowledge, without desire.\nThis sentence summarizes the preceding meaning,\nWhile the next demonstrates the method.\n\nEver make the people without knowledge, without desire—\nThis is to emphasize:\n*\"Do not value the worthy,\nDo not prize wealth,\nDo not show what is desirable,\"*\nThus achieving a hollow heart and full belly,\nA weak will and strong bones.\nThe Sage, governing the world, relies on these seven principles—\nNothing else is needed—\nMaking the people without knowledge, without desire.\n\nTo value the worthy brings excessive knowledge,\nUntil the world is in uproar—\nConfucians and Mohists arise in chaos.\nTo prize wealth brings excessive desire,\nUntil one risks life and nature for gain,\nSeizing and deceiving without restraint.\nTo see names and profits as desirable—\nAll are deviations from the Dao.\n\nOnly the Sage can abandon these three,\nAnd thus the people naturally have no knowledge,\nNor any desire.\n\nYet human nature is thick,\nAnd circumstances shift with things.\nFor those above, cleverness and artifice\nAre taught and refined—\nBut when carried to excess,\nLaws and punishments cannot correct them.\n\n**Master Dong said:**\n*\"When laws are issued, deceit arises;\nWhen orders are given, fraud follows.\"*\nThis stems from past rulers’ poor instruction,\nAnd the deep corruption of customs—\nNot something that can be changed in a day.\n\nNow, even if one tries to suppress it with laws,\nOr reinforces it with decrees,\nTheir deceitful hearts remain—\nOnly the Dao can transform them.\n\nLaws began with Fu Xi and were perfected by Yao,\nFully developed in the Zhou—\nYet cleverness reached its peak.\nThus it is known that when the Zhou declined,\nThe Dao faded.\n\nLaozi composed the *Classic*,\nIts intent here.\nYet it was not merely for his time—\nIt was meant as an oracle for all ages.\n\nWhen chaos arose, it was no different from the Warring States—\nThe excess of valuing the worthy, prizing wealth, and excessive desire.\n\n**Confucius said:**\n*\"The people can be made to follow, but not to understand.\"*\n\n**Emperor Yao heard a child’s song:**\n*\"Unknowing, unknowing,\nFollowing Heaven’s patterns.\"*\n\nIf those above are knowledgeable and desiring,\nYet wish the people to be without knowledge or desire—\nThis is impossible.\nIt is like hating drunkenness yet forcing wine—\nTruly, nothing is better than\nUsing utmost sincerity to transform them,\nPurity and simplicity to guard them.\nIf those above act as if foolish,\nThe people below remain unknowing—\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"The ruler like a tree branch,\nThe people like wild deer—\nWhat use is there for rewards and punishments?\"*\n\nForced effort and rigid conduct,\nSeparating from the world and customs—\nThe people begin to doubt.\n\n**Second Point: Restraining cleverness and artifice.**\nMake the knowledgeable dare not act.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"I will deceive them with simplicity—*\n*The people are hard to govern because their cleverness is excessive.\"*\n\n**Zhuangzi said:**\n*\"When the Dao prevails in the world, the Sage completes it;\nWhen the Dao does not prevail, the Sage arises.\"*\n\nExcessive knowledge and desire\nThrow the world into chaos—\nUntil the people lose their natural nature,\nAnd punishment is used to suppress them—\nThis is the root of greater disorder.\n\nThe Qin poisoned the world—\nTheir cleverness was supreme,\nYet they could not use benevolence and righteousness,\nOnly punishment and coercion,\nTo govern the world—\nTheir kindness did not reach the people,\nSo their downfall came swiftly.\n\nYet the people were not without knowledge—\nIt could be hidden and unused.\nOnly if those above do not provoke it,\nThen those below, though knowing, dare not act.\n\n*The Yinxu Classic* says:\n*\"Cut off the root of gain,\nAnd ten armies will be useless.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nIf those who know dare to act,\nThen even strict prohibitions are insufficient.\nTo this point, even if one wishes to punish them,\nThere are those punishment cannot reach.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves.\"*\n\n**Fourth: Displaying the function of *wuwei*.**\n\n1. *Transformation proceeds without display.*\n\n*Wuwei* yet action—\nThis sentence summarizes the entire meaning,\nTo show that the Sage, though governing through *wuwei*,\nIs never without action.\n\n*Wuwei* cuts off external interference,\nAction aligns with affairs—\nWhat is not the Dao becomes the Dao in practice.\n\nTo act without showing traces of action,\nTo govern without displaying governance—\nThis is the pinnacle.\n\nHow then does one act without showing traces,\nOr govern without displaying function?\n\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*\"Motionless yet responsive,\nStirred and thus in harmony.\"*\n\nThe unmoving is nature,\nThe responsive is emotion.\nNature is originally *wuwei*—\nThe essence of the Dao.\n\nThe Dao as nature\nIs formless in reality,\nYet at its extreme, it manifests—\nFrom Heaven and Earth to all things,\nNone arise without this.\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n*\"All things flourish,\nYet they all stem from *wuwei*—this is the Dao.\"*\n\nEmerging from the Sage’s heart,\nResponding to the divine in sequence—\nPenetrating Heaven, Heaven responds;\nPenetrating Earth, Earth responds—\nNothing but the movement of spirit.\n\nWhat is seen in the movement of spirit—\nThis is action.\nWhat moves yet shows no progress—\nThis is originally *wuwei*.\n\nMoreover, if one does not act,\nCould the world’s affairs be neglected for a day or two?\nNeglect leads to disorder.\nIf one governs each matter,\nInspects each thing—\nThen labor is endless.",

what the people delight in becomes the *custom*.\nWhen the ruler prizes the wise and clever, the common folk’s hearts turn to rivalry and striving.\n\n*\"Not valuing the worthy\"* prevents the people from contending over reputation—that is all.\n\nFood is but a commodity; its purpose is to sustain life—why then prize what is rare?\nIf rarity is prized, the people will surely hoard it.\nBy human nature, if given, they will not accept it; if hoarded, they will steal and plunder.\n\nIn governing, one does not refrain from using wealth—yet one does not prize rare and difficult-to-obtain goods, lest the people become thieves.\n\nWhen the common folk see no allure in fame or gain, their desires grow orderly, and the people govern themselves.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\n*\"Not valuing the worthy\"* makes the people ignorant—ignorance empties the mind, and an empty mind can embrace all things.\nHence, *\"fill their bellies.\"*\n*\"Not prizing wealth\"* makes the people desireless—desirelessness weakens the will, and a weak will does not bend to circumstance.\nHence, *\"strengthen their bones.\"*\n\nEver keep the people ignorant, so their minds remain empty;\nEver keep them desireless, so they forget the world.\nWhen mind and world are both forgotten, no attachments remain—all affairs cease.\nThus, even the wise dare not act.\nThe Sage acts with no intention—then nothing in the world remains untended.\n\n**Wáng Zhìrán** said:\n*\"Not valuing the worthy\"* makes the people not contend—thus nothing remains untended.\n\nTo speak of the Dao yet disregard its order is not the Dao.\nTo speak of the Dao yet misunderstand it—how can one claim to have found it?\n\nZhuangzi’s *\"Nine Transformations\"* and *\"Five Changes\"*—discarding or upholding *xíngmíng* (names and forms)—is like walking the Dao backward.\nThose who encounter the Dao and praise it—how can they govern others?\nThose who suddenly speak of *xíngmíng*—have they not yet grasped the fundamental intent of learning and governance?\n\nNames are the guests of reality.\nOnce names and reality are fixed in their internal and external distinctions, all under Heaven’s ranks follow their duties—why would the worthy be abandoned in the wild, unused?\n\nYet Laozi’s intent in saying *\"do not value them\"* holds profound meaning.\nThus Zhuangzi says: *\"To promote the worthy is to invite contention over titles.\"*\n\nValuing the worthy sparks contention—leading to chaos under Heaven, where cunning deceit, disputes over right and wrong, and the dissolution of morals arise.\nConfucians and Mohists all emerge—such is the danger of valuing the worthy.\n\nGathering all under Heaven’s wealth to nourish its people, yet the people are content, striking the earth and singing, drumming their bellies and wandering—each thing serves its purpose without being enslaved by things.\nHow could one secretly prize such a state?\n\nLaozi’s intent in saying *\"do not prize them\"* is also profound.\n\nAll things under Heaven flourish in their appointed roles—each has its place.\nWhen their time to flourish comes, so too comes their time to decay.\nWhen their time to be prized comes, so too comes their time to be despised.\nThis is their natural course—how can one’s heart interfere?\n\nThose who seek to prize them must obtain them at all costs.\nIf they cannot, they will risk life and limb to seize them—\nleading to robbery, covetousness, and every vice.\nIs theft the only sin?\n\nThis stems from the ruler’s preferences—when the ruler favors something, the people will pursue it excessively.\n\nThe *Classic* says: *\"Do not let the desirable be seen, lest the heart be disturbed.\"*\nConfucius said: *\"Wealth and honor are what people desire.\"*\nEven what is seen and heard—scented, tasted, or felt—stirs the emotions and disturbs the mind, all called *\"desirable.\"*\n\nIf desire is insatiable, even Heaven and Earth’s vastness and all things’ abundance cannot satisfy it.\n\nThe gentleman desires *name*; the commoner desires *gain*.\nIf all under Heaven—worthy or unworthy—see no desirable desires, their hearts remain still—what disturbance could there be?\n\nThus the Sage ever empties the mind, unfettered by any thing;\nEver fills the belly, unobstructed by any thing.\nWithin, observing the mind—vast and empty;\nWithout, observing the form—yielding with things like flowing water.\nFrom afar, observing things—things have no hold on him.\n\nThus, a weak will is useful;

The beauty of Máoqiáng and Lìjì is renowned throughout the land—\nno one fails to covet it.\nYet fish seeing them dive deep, birds seeing them soar high,\nand deer seeing them flee swiftly—\nby this reasoning, indeed, if one truly sees nothing as desirable,\nthen the heart remains undisturbed.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance reaches the point of filling one’s belly.\nNánguō Zǐtài reclined behind his screen, gazing heavenward and sighing,\nlost in his own emptiness—\nto cultivate the heart to this extent is what may be called *emptiness* (虚).\n\nBeyond mere satiation, though rare delicacies and sumptuous flavors\nbe displayed before him,\nhe fears only that they may not be swiftly cleared away—\nthis is why his belly craves only the real.\n\nThe *Classic* states: *\"The Sage governs for the belly, not for the eyes.\"*\n\nWeaken one’s resolve.\nThose who strengthen themselves have resolve.\nNow, why weaken it?\nStrengthening oneself may advance one toward the Dao,\nbut weakening it may lead one to the state of daily diminishment.\n\nStrengthen one’s bones.\nThe Dao of Lǎozǐ runs deep in the principle of *strong strength* (强强).\nThus it is said: *\"The overbearing shall not meet their natural end.\"*\nNow, why strengthen one’s bones?\nIt is a warning against the strong—\nlest they contend with things.\nStrengthening one’s bones is self-strengthening.\nThe Dao stands firm and unchanging—\nhow could the weak govern it?\nAlways keep the people without knowledge and without desire.\n\nLǎozǐ likened governing the state and the people\nto cultivating oneself,\nsaying *\"to make the people\"* is to make oneself—\nwithout knowledge and without desire,\nnot like the dullness of wood or stone that lacks all desire.\nAt first, one cannot lack knowledge entirely—\nto remove knowledge until it is utterly gone;\nat first, one cannot lack desire entirely—\nto remove desire until it is utterly gone.\nThen, who but a Daoist gentleman,\nwith his accumulated virtue,\ncould achieve this?\n\nIf the wise are allowed to appear,\nthen nothing shall remain ungoverned.\nThe Dao is natural—\nhow could it be shaped by intelligence?\nOnly by acting without action in non-action\nmay it be attained.\n\nChéng Tài’s words on governance say:\n*\"Not valuing the worthy brings the people to non-contention,\nuntil the heart is undisturbed.\"*\nIf such a person is worthy,\nyet he hides his excellence and does not display it,\nflashing his brilliance before the world,\nthen surely there will be those who shame themselves\nfor not being equal to him\nand who strive to contend with him.\nThus Zhuāngzǐ said: *\"To elevate the worthy is to invite the people to jostle.\"*\n\nTo prize hard-to-obtain wealth\nis to invite those who abandon their livelihoods\nto chase profit,\nand who do not hesitate to become thieves.\nThus it is said: *\"Wealth accumulates, then contention arises.\"*\nContention and theft all stem from seeing what is desirable\nand thus stirring the heart.\nIf the ruler conceals his likes and dislikes,\nand does not reveal them,\nthen the people below have no direction for profit,\nand all that is desirable no longer appears before them.\nThe heart remains undisturbed,\nand contention and theft naturally cease.\nThis is the Dao of Lǎozǐ—\nrectifying the root and clarifying the source.\n\nJiāng Yǔ’s exhortation on governance says:\n*\"Necessarily elevate those of public loyalty,\nand let there be nothing private,\nthen who among the people would dare not to be orderly?\"*\nJiāng Yǔ’s words,\nthough common among those who seek governance since Yáo and Shùn,\nwere criticized by Jìzhé, who said:\n*\"If you speak thus, it is only your own way of acting.\"*\nThe dangers of the high platform are many,\nand those who would cast their lot there are numerous—\na criticism of displaying excellence openly,\nas clear as the platform’s invitation to all,\nso that they see what is desirable and flock to it,\nand contention grows.\n\nYet, if the worthy are seen but not valued,\nis this not a distinction?\nIt is only to obliterate traces\nand thus extinguish contention.\nAll that Lǎozǐ’s teaching seeks to conceal and use subtly\nholds this same intent.\n*See* (见) is read as *manifest* (现)—\nwhen the ruler steps forth and reveals himself.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance reaches the point of strengthening one’s bones.\nThe mind is always present in thought,\nand resolve is present when action is desired.\nThe belly is for nourishment,\nand the bones are for bearing burdens.\nLǎozǐ’s text contains metaphor and direct speech—\nhere, the belly and bones\nare indeed their true names.\n\nIn a later passage, it is said:\n*\"The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\"*\nThis is the case where one should fill what is real\nand dispel what is false.\n\nAgain it is said:\n*\"The people are difficult to govern because their cleverness is excessive.\"*\nThis is the warning against the strong\nand the search for means to weaken them.\n\nGēngsāng’s dwelling feared collapse—\nhis clever ministers left him,\nhis compassionate concubines withdrew—\nnot allowing his heart to harbor cleverness or compassion,\nthis is the pursuit of emptiness.\n\nTo dwell with those who are bloated\nand to appoint those who are clumsy—\nbloated and clumsy are not those whose bones are strong\nand can endure burdens,\nyet they are not counted among the few.\nThis is why he established Gēngsāng’s principles,\nmocking Yáo and Shùn’s elevation of the worthy\nand appointment of the clever.\n\nAlways keep the people without knowledge and without desire.\nIf the people have knowledge, then their cleverness is excessive,\nand this is why they are difficult to govern.\nIf they have desire, then they see what is desirable,\nand this is why contention and theft arise.\nLǎozǐ values *non-action* (无为),\nwishing to place the world in a state of *non-affairs* (无事),\nand to make the world also content with *non-affairs*.\nZhuāngzǐ’s words on governance effects say:\n*\"To align with the lack of knowledge—\nits virtue does not depart.\nTo align with the lack of desire—\nthis is called *primordial simplicity* (素朴).\"*\nIn primordial simplicity, the nature of the world is attained.\n\nIf the wise are not allowed to act,\nthen they do not dare to act.\nTo make the people without knowledge and without desire\nis to make them dull.\nYet among them are those who are obstinate and clever,\nunreceptive to dullness—\nthese are the ones called *clever*.\nThe clever cannot be made dull again.\n\nThus, if all under heaven follow my teaching,\nthen they shall all be without knowledge and without desire.\nWithout knowledge and without desire,\nthey shall love their native soil and find joy in their work,\nand cannot be lured into chaos.\nEven if there are the clever,\nknowing they have no one to join them,\nthey shall lose resolve and no longer dare to act.\nHence it is said:\n*\"Make the people value death over migration,\nthen even with armies and weapons,\nthere shall be no place to deploy them.\"*\nThe Sage who claims he can again bind the people with knots\nachieves this through these very means.\n\nZhuāngzǐ took this language and entrusted it to antiquity,\nsaying:\n*\"The ancient people dwelled in the *chaotic undifferentiation* (混茫),\nand with

      "translated_text": "At this very time, all things remain unharmed, all living beings do not perish young, and though people may have wisdom, they have no use for it—this is the very proof of it. To act through *non-action* (*wuwei*) is to ensure nothing remains untended.\n\nThough it is said to act through *non-action*, this does not mean abandoning deeds entirely. Rather, to dwell in *non-action* and govern through *non-interference*, this is what is meant by *wuwei*. I govern through *non-action*, and the people respond with their own *wuwei*—this is what is called *\"govern through non-action, and the people transform themselves; govern through non-interference, and the people prosper on their own.\"* How then could there be any failure to achieve order?\n\nZhān Qiúbù said: *\"If one does not exalt the virtuous, the people will not contend for them, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\"* The chapter *\"Nurturing the People\"* speaks of not desiring to honor the virtuous, so that the people do not grow reckless and contend for fame. Not valuing rare treasures and strange jewels, so that the people do not turn to theft. Not displaying alluring luxuries and dazzling beauties, so that the heart does not generate chaotic desires. Thus, the Sage who governs the people, wishing to dwell in harmony with them for long, must first empty his own heart and abandon his cravings, always keeping the people in a state of *wu zhi wu yu* [without knowledge, without desire]. Even if they are wise, they dare not act. Thus, through *non-action*, governance becomes effortless and stable.\n\nZhang Chong replied: *\"If one does not exalt the virtuous, the people will not contend for them, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\"* Laozi emerged from the ancient past, when customs were pure and people were simple. They lived daily in *wuwei*, forgetting fame and gain, abstaining from music and color, their five spirits unperturbed. From the ancient times onward, the people changed from *Huang* [Yellow Emperor], to *Shi* [Emperor], to *Di* [Emperor], to *Wang* [King], with officials named after birds, then dragons, then kings, nobles, ministers, and great officers—all adorned with grand titles. Thus, empty names flourished, and the world came to revere those who wielded power through cleverness. Hence, Bi Gan contended and died, while Yi and Qi could not contend and so withdrew. The suffering of endless wars and strife arose, and yet they dug mountains and plundered the sea, mined gold and sifted sand, seeking fine jade and precious stones—never satisfied. Strange treasures and marvelous jewels only deepened their delusion. The world treasured rare and difficult-to-obtain goods, so Yu’s clan perished for hoarding jade, and Shi’s family was ruined for hiding treasure—thus bringing ruin to themselves and their virtue.\n\nAgain, the licentious sounds of pipes and bells assailed the ears, the wanton allure of women dazzled the eyes, strange flavors offended the palate, strange scents assailed the nose, and strange garments offended the body—clouding the mind and scattering the spirit—while alluring forms were laid bare. Thus, Shang fell to its debauchery of nightlong drinking, and Chen was destroyed by its decadence in the rear chambers, giving rise to regicide, rebellion, and chaos—all from these three evils.\n\nThus, the Sages of antiquity governed the people with no other means: they did not exalt those who wielded power through cleverness, did not treasure rare and difficult-to-obtain goods, nor indulged the allurements of desire. When the ruler acted thus, the people followed suit, and there was nothing to stir the hearts of contention, theft, or rebellion.\n\nThus, when the heart is emptied and no action is taken, the three evils [contention, theft, rebellion] are restrained. When the belly is filled and the Dao is cultivated without action, the three evils are exhausted. When the will is weakened—neither exalting, nor treasuring, nor desiring—while the bones are strengthened to remain ever healthy, strong, and at peace, if people observe my *non-action*, they will naturally be without knowledge and without desire.\n\nShould any wise person wish to exalt the virtuous, to treasure rare goods, or to indulge the five senses—eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and body—even they dare not act. Thus, all people act as if in *non-action*, and there is none who remains ungoverned.\n\nZhang Lingying said: If the heart is not emptied and clarified, how can the *qi* be harmonized and the organs filled? If the will is not humble and weak, how can the essence be solidified to strengthen the sinews and bones? When the heart is always empty, the *qi* is not depleted; when the will is always weak, the essence is not wasted. Then the belly is full, the bones are strong—what more could ail one with fears of *trendency* (*quju*) or *nocturnal emissions* (*mengyi*)?\n\nGenerally, when a man suffers from *trendency*, it arises from *qi* that is not harmonized; when he loses semen in dreams, it comes from essence that is not solidified. Both stem from *qi* not harmonized—because the heart is not emptied—and essence not solidified—because the will is not weakened.\n\nBái Yùqiān said: *\"Not exalting the virtuous\"* means that as a son, one must be filial; as a subject, one must be loyal—thus the people do not contend, and when full, they do not crave more food. *\"Not treasuring rare goods\"* means gold is valued no more than soil—thus the people do not steal, for there is nothing to desire. *\"Not displaying alluring luxuries\"* means the heart remains steadfast between the ears—thus the heart does not stray; when it does, it is called back. Therefore, the Sage’s governance lies in emptying the heart, filling the belly, weakening the will, and strengthening the bones—always keeping the people without knowledge and without desire. Even the wise dare not act. Thus, through *non-action*, nothing remains ungoverned.",

      "translated_text": "「When Xie Tunan said: *\"If one does not exalt the worthy, the hearts of the people will not be disturbed.\"*\n\nFor a ruler to employ the worthy and utilize their abilities is a natural duty, but he must not establish the name of exaltation. Once the name of exaltation is set, then the petty will seize upon it to claim the title for themselves. If one prizes and honors things of rare value that bring no benefit, then those who covet what is difficult to obtain will inevitably think of stealing and taking by force. If one exposes the senses to what is merely desirable yet unprofitable, it will stir the heart and lead to those who seek to disrupt what is done.\n\nThe ruler’s intentions must be cautious indeed. Therefore, the sage acts with utmost sincerity—\nto empty the heart is to prevent desires from entering within,\nto fill the belly is to ensure that the Dao’s nourishment does not fail within,\nto weaken the will is to let intentions not stray into arrogance or submission,\nto strengthen the bones is to cultivate vigor without weariness in labor.\nThus does the sage govern—\never making the people reach the state of *non-treatment*.\n\nDesires arise from knowledge;\nwithout knowledge, there are no desires.\nIf the ruler transforms with *non-knowledge* and *non-desire*,\nthen the people respond with *non-knowledge* and *non-desire*.\nEven if he cannot make them utterly free of knowledge,\nthose among them who boast of cleverness and display ability\nwill still be subtly diminished and transformed,\nuntil they retreat to the point where they dare not act.\nThis so-called \"knowledge\" is but the private scheming of blood and *qi*—\nnot the true *virtue* of the heart.\n\nIf they dare to act, it will surely harm governance.\nTherefore, when the ruler governs with *non-action*,\nthere is nothing the people cannot be brought to *non-treatment*.\n\nIndeed, the people follow not the ruler’s commands,\nbut his inclinations.\nIf his intentions are not cautious,\nthen his words and deeds will inevitably invite excess.\nThe sages of old sincerely cultivated their intentions to rectify their hearts,\nrectified their hearts to cultivate their persons,\ncultivated their persons to govern the state and pacify the world—\ntheir spirit and thought concentrated in one hall,\nwhile their moral influence spread far and wide across the ten thousand *li*,\nresponding to the slightest movement without delay.\nLater rulers, however, exhausted their emotions and indulged their desires,\ndoing whatever they pleased,\nand yet blamed the world for its difficulty to transform,\nand the people for their stubbornness.\nAlas, how confused they were!\n\nLin Yongqing said: *\"If one does not exalt the worthy, the people will not vie—\nthen there will be nothing that is not governed.\"*\n\n*Exaltation* means *boasting*.\nIf I boast of the worthy, then I will surely arouse contention throughout the world.\nYu alone did not boast, and thus none could vie with him in ability.\nThis is the meaning.\n\nIf I prize rare treasures,\nthen all will have desires to obtain them,\nand the consequence will be theft.\nThese two lines reveal the intent of what follows:\n*\"If one does not see what is desirable, then the heart naturally settles.\nNot seeing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.\"*\nThese eight characters are most excellent.\n\nTo empty the heart is to have no thoughts of admiration.\nTo fill the belly is to satisfy hunger for food.\nTo weaken the will is to avoid striving for competition.\nTo strengthen the bones is to nourish one’s vitality.\nIt speaks of the sages of antiquity,\nwho merely ensured the people were well-fed,\nwith no other thoughts of admiration,\nand whose strength was robust yet unspent in competition—\nthus their people were pure and simple,\nwithout knowledge or desire,\nthough cleverness might occasionally stir within them,\ntheir knowledge, though sprouting in the heart,\nwould not dare to manifest in action.\n\nThe sage’s governance of the world was thus,\nand yet the sage himself had no place in the world for his heart.\nIn his governance, he acted entirely with *non-action*,\nand thus there was nothing that was not governed.\n*\"Not seeing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.\"*\nThis describes how the sage taught his people.\n\n*To employ* means to guide the people.\nNot exalting the worthy,\nnot honoring rare treasures—\nall these stem from fear of stirring desires.\nStirring desires is not limited to these two matters;\nthey are merely stated as examples.\n\nLaozi lamented the confusion of the later ages,\nand thus pondered the simplicity of antiquity.\nHis words, however, were somewhat excessive,\nand thus did not fully capture the sage’s Way.\n\nFan Yingyuan said: *\"Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from vying.*\n*Exaltation* means *preference*.\nThe worthy are those with *ability*.\nAgain, according to the *Shuo Wen* [\"Explanations of Texts\"], they are those with *many talents*.\n*Vying* means *competition*—\nif one favors those with slight talents and abilities,\nthen the people will compete to cultivate these talents and abilities,\nand not seek the natural Way.\n\nMoreover, slight talents and abilities can be used by others,\nbut those with slight talents and abilities cannot be relied upon to use others.\nTo strive for talent while neglecting *virtue* is not the conduct of a gentleman.\nIf the ruler does not favor those with slight talents and abilities,\nthen the people will not vie.\n\nNot honoring rare treasures prevents the people from becoming thieves.\nRare treasures refer to gold and jade—\nif one honors them, then the people will love the objects\nand suffer from their lack,\nleading them to theft.\n\nTherefore, the sage’s governance reaches its peak in strengthening the bones.\n*Governance* means *order*—\nordering oneself to order the world.\nIf the ruler has no exaltation,\nthen the people will not indulge in vain imaginings—\ndesires are removed,\nis this not also emptying the heart?\n\nIf the ruler cherishes *Dao* and *virtue*,\nthen the people will embrace simplicity—\nthe natural order is preserved.\nIs this not also filling the belly?\n\nIf the ruler maintains gentleness and harmony,\nthen the people will be transformed,\nand their *qi* will not be violent—\nis this not also weakening the will?\n\nIf the ruler has no fondness for desires,\nthen the people will be transformed,\nand their bodies will naturally be robust and healthy—\nis this not also strengthening the bones?\n\nIf one can achieve this,\nthen one can make the people without knowledge or desire.\nThese four lines have those who interpret them solely in terms of personal cultivation,\nyet the text before and after clearly conveys the idea of rectifying oneself and transforming the people.\n\nEver making the people without knowledge—\nthen they dare not act.\nFor the people, when they know of exaltation,\nwhen they see what is desirable,\nthey will vie and steal,\nand bring chaos.\nTherefore, one must always guide them to have no false knowledge or false desires,\nand prevent clever and cunning men from acting presumptuously.\n\nTo govern with *non-action* is to have nothing that is not governed.\nThe sage has no words of exaltation,\nyet the people do not see what is desirable—\nfollowing the natural order in responding to things,\nthere is always a proper path to take,\nand thus it is *non-action* that prevails.»",

their wills,*\n*then the Way of governance remains gentle.*\n*Strengthen their bones,*\n*then their limbs will not grow slack.*\n\n*Always make the people without knowledge and without desire—*\n*then nothing will remain ungoverned.*\n*In accord with ignorance,*\n*their virtue does not stray.*\n*In accord with desirelessness,*\n*this is called natural simplicity.*\n\nIf one can make the people thus,\neven the wise will not dare to act presumptuously.\n\n*Without desire, the world is sufficient.*\n*Without action, all things transform.*\n*Depth and stillness bring the people peace—*\nis this not the governance of *non-action*?\n\nXiu Xiu An said:\n*\"To not exalt the worthy makes the people not contend—*\n*then nothing will remain ungoverned.*\n\nThose who embrace the Way and practice the teaching of *non-speech*,\n*are internally empty and externally compliant,*\n*without likes or dislikes,*\n*thus they do not exalt the worthy,*\n*nor prize rare and difficult-to-obtain goods.*\n\nIf one has likes or exalts,\n*it is due to emotions and perceptions,*\n*and one cannot avoid*\n*giving rise to ability,*\n*to greedy pursuit,*\n*or to contention for merit,*\n*or to theft.*\n\nFor those advancing the Way and nurturing virtue,\n*they must first let no thought arise,*\n*reach the state of utmost emptiness,*\n*refined subtlety and mysterious penetration,*\n*and then attain self-cultivation.*\n\n*Is not the spirit of clarity precious?*\nIf there are thoughts of love or desire,\n*then emotions will be stirred,*\n*and the true heart will be confused.*\n\nThus, the sage cultivates oneself, harmonizes the family,\ngoverns the state, and brings peace to the world—\n*emptying their heart,*\n*without self, their measure is vast,*\n*their governance is *non-action*, yet all things transform naturally.*\n\n*To hold the Way in one’s bosom,*\n*is to fill their belly.*\n*To expand the virtue of non-contentiousness,*\n*is to weaken their will.*\n*To vigorously practice this Way,*\n*is to strengthen their bones.*\n\nIf one can do this,\n*they extinguish perception and have no knowledge,*\n*and emotions are annihilated.*\n\nZhu Boqiu said:\n*\"To not exalt the worthy makes the people not contend—*\n*then nothing will remain ungoverned.*\n\nThe ancients treasured innate worthiness,\nseeing the worthy and striving to emulate them.\nBut here it says ‘not exalt’—what does this mean?\n*For those of this age,*\n*many exalt their own worthiness,*\n*thus stirring contention,*\n*and jealousy arises from disorder.*\n*Only by not exalting one’s own worthiness*\n*can one recognize the true worthy of the world.*\n\nIt does not mean to abandon the worthy in the wild,\n*nor to not employ them.*\n*In times of moral decay,*\n*so-called worthy ones are not necessarily true,*\n*and those who are exalted are not necessarily sincere.*\n*The ruler feigns seeking worthy men,*\n*the scholars bear the ambition of their own worthiness,*\n*with deceit meeting deceit,*\n*all sink into vice,*\n*and worthiness becomes an empty title—*\n*how can it benefit the family and state?*\n\nTo teach ‘not to exalt one’s own worthiness’\n*is to clarify the source and open the path*\n*for the four seas’ worthy to come.*\n\n*Goods circulate in the world,*\n*abundant or scarce,*\n*to provide for the people’s use.*\n*Here, ‘not to prize’ refers*\n*specifically to rare and costly treasures—*\n*inch-long pearls, foot-wide jade,*\n*southern gold, great cowries,*\n*beautiful sounds and beasts,*\n*and objects of indulgence,*\n*which bring no benefit to the family and state,*\n*no relief to hunger and cold.*\n*If the ruler takes them,*\n*the people below will follow,*\n*leading to violence and theft,*\n*and the world’s hearts will be stirred by greed,*\n*with theft spreading between ruler and people.*\n\nBut as for flowing circulation,\n*like water and grain,*\n*silk, hemp, rice, and cloth—*\n*the people rely on these for life and sustenance.*\n*They are never neglected,*\n*thus it is said:*\n*‘Not to prize rare goods,*\n*but to value useful ones,*\n*to appropriately employ and utilize,*\n*ensuring abundance in homes—*\n*then where is the theft to come from?’*\n\nIn later ages, greed and extravagance ruined standards,\n*while lustful desires eroded the heart.*\n*The world was in chaos,*\n*all alike in one pattern.*\n*Only those who study and know the Way*\n*have clear boundaries,*\n*and will not overstep them.*\n*If one seeks indulgence and loses resolve,*\n*then food is taken merely to fill hunger,*\n*clothing is worn only for warmth,*\n*homes shelter against wind,*\n*and the two blessings of joy and fortune*\n*are measured by abundance or scarcity.*\n*What they enjoy is limited,*\n*what they seek is easily satisfied,*\n*their hearts harbor no covetousness—*\n*what can stir disorder in them?*\n\n*The ruler does not exalt the worthy,*\n*then the people below do not contend for renown.*\n*The ruler does not prize goods,*\n*then the people below do not contend for profit.*\n*The ruler does not display what is desirable,*\n*then the hearts of the people are not disordered.*\n\nAll this stems from *emptying the heart,*\n*so it does not receive external things,*\n*and thus what is desirable finds no entry.*\n\n*Empty the heart,*\n*then the original spirit dwells.*\n*Fill the belly,*\n*then the original qi gathers.*\n\n*To strengthen their resolve while weakening their will,*\n*is the means to invite harmony.*\n*To strengthen their bones while letting them bear labor,*\n*is the means to

      "translated_text": "The unknowing is purity, the desireless is simplicity, and purity and simplicity are the Way of *wuwei*.\n\nTo always govern the people thus means that the Sage first practices it himself, and only then can he make the people unknowing and desireless, pure and simple in *wuwei*.\n\nFor only when the ruler’s virtue is manifest can he make the people’s virtue manifest.\n\nAs in the age of primal antiquity, when the world was in *wuwei*—when the ruler above was in *wuwei*, then those below were also in *wuwei*.\n\nThe ruler is like the wind, the people like the grass.\nWhen the wind does not bend the grass, such a thing does not exist in the world.\n\nThe customs of the unknowing, the winds of simplicity and purity—these belong to the age of supreme antiquity and its virtue.\n\nZhuangzi said: In the age of supreme virtue, the worthy are not honored, the capable are not employed. The ruler is like a branch of a tree, the people like wild deer—straightforward without knowing it as *ren*, loving one another without knowing it as *yi*, sincere without knowing it as *zhong*, faithful without knowing it as *xin*. They move clumsily yet govern one another without calling it a blessing.\n\nThus, they act without striving, serve without leaving a trace. Filial sons do not flatter their parents, loyal ministers do not fawn on their lords—this is the custom of purity and simplicity.\n\nTherefore, the Sage first transforms himself from above, and thus it is said: *\"Always govern the people by making them unknowing and desireless.\"*\n\nTo make the wise dare not act.\n\nIn the age of antiquity, the customs were pure, and there were no distinctions of *san gang*—lord-subject, father-son, husband-wife—and no visible *wu chang*—*ren, yi, li, zhi, xin*. All shared equally, yet did not know how they obtained it; all were born naturally, yet did not know how they came to be. Dwelling with beasts, mingling with all things, how could they know of noble and base?\n\nIn their shared unknowing, their virtue did not depart; in their shared desirelessness, this is called *suzhu*—the uncarved block—and the people returned to their nature.\n\nIf such pure and simple folk were to encounter clever and bright scholars, though they possessed knowledge, they would have no use for it.\n\nThus it is said: *\"To make the wise dare not act.\"*\n\nTo practice *wuwei* is to have nothing that cannot be governed.\n\nThe virtue of the Sage-King takes heaven and earth as its root, *Dao* and virtue as its master, and *wuwei* as its constant.\n\nTo be in *wuwei* is to govern the world with abundance.\nTo act with *wei* is to be used by the world yet remain insufficient.\n\n*Wuwei* is the balance of heaven and earth, the ultimate of *Dao* and virtue. To understand this and sit in the south-facing hall is to be Yao as sovereign.\nTo understand this and face north is to be Shun as minister.\n\nTo hold this in high station is the virtue of the Emperor and Son of Heaven.\nTo hold this in low station is the *Dao* of the ancient and pure Sage-Kings.\n\nTo retreat and dwell in leisure among rivers, seas, mountains, and forests is the way of the recluse.\nTo advance and govern the world is to achieve great deeds and a resounding name, uniting all under heaven.\n\nThus it is said: *\"To practice wuwei is to have nothing that cannot be governed.\"*\n\nYang Zhiren said: *\"To not honor the worthy makes the people not contend, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\"*\n\nTo not honor the worthy means that wealth and nobility are not desired, titles and emoluments are not possessed. One does not attend the Son of Heaven above, nor pay respects to ministers below. Thus one possesses the virtue of non-contention.\n\nTo not prize rare goods means that strange treasures, precious metals, and fine jade are but external things. The heart is serene, the people content. Externally, no desires are seen; internally, the mind is undisturbed.\n\nThe enlightened see yet do not see, moving freely in all directions.\nThe ancients said: *\"If I have no mind toward all things, how can all things not surround me?\"*\n\nThe Sage’s practice is to empty the heart of all attachments, fill the belly to preserve the essence, weaken the will to remain humble, and strengthen the bones to nurture the boundless.\n\nMy heart is pure, the people’s hearts are simple. Without desire, without knowledge, the wise dare not act.\n\nTo be in *wuwei* yet accomplish all is to have nothing that cannot be governed.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: *\"Yanzi’s limbs were exhausted, his brilliance discarded, his form abandoned, his wisdom set aside—this is to not honor the worthy.\"*\n\nEating coarse grains, drinking from a gourd, dwelling in a humble lane—though others could not endure the hardship, Yan Hui did not change his joy.\n\nTo not prize rare goods is to not steal; to not see desire is to not be disturbed—this is the way.\n\nTo nourish the proper with ease is humility;\nto be lowly yet honored is the Sage’s way of emptying the heart, filling the belly, weakening the will, and strengthening the bones—without knowledge, without desire, in *wuwei* yet without failing to govern.\n\nYu Qingzhong said: *\"To not honor the worthy makes the people not contend, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\"*\n\nTo not honor the worthy makes the people not contend—this means that if you do not boast of your abilities, none will contend with you in skill.\n\nTo not prize rare goods makes the people not steal—this means that if one does not covet, even if rewarded, one will not take it, as Gongsun Long said.\n\nTo not see what is desirable makes the heart not disturbed—this is the most critical teaching of the *Taishang*.\n\nZigong, seeing the splendor of the capital and taking delight, saw what was desirable and his heart was disturbed. Yet upon returning and hearing the Master’s *Dao*, he found joy—seeing no desire, his heart was undisturbed.\n\nDamo faced the wall at Shaolin for nine years—this too was the meaning.\n\nThe training of the worthy is like my sole virtue being laborious. Generally, those who seek to excel in all things are called worthy—such as those who love grandeur and achievement, who exhaust armies and wage wars, always seeking to surpass predecessors, not merely boasting of cleverness and strength.\n\nHan Wen, emulating the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s quietude, used humble words and thick gifts, and pacified distant peoples, yet said, *\"I am a concubine’s son of the High Emperor\"*—this was to not honor the worthy.\n\nQi Gaozu said: *\"If I were to govern the world for ten years, I would make gold as common as dirt.\"* This was to not prize rare goods.\n\nGenerally, women are what people desire, as are wealth and nobility.

      "translated_text": "The Sage’s governance of the world—what other Way could there be?\nTo receive them into the realm of thoughtlessness and carelessness, to empty their hearts.\nYet for the eight-mouth household, one must ensure they know no hunger—\nfor banditry arises from poverty.\n\nTransform them with gentleness, teach them with softness, to weaken their resolve.\nYet one must also compel them to labor their sinews and bones in service,\nlest they grow fat from ease and dwell in idleness without discipline.\n\nThe four characters—*emptiness, fullness, weakness, strength*—\nare like mother and child.\nTo fill their bellies and strengthen their bones—\nthis is where the Sage’s meticulous and subtle considerations lie.\n\nGovern thus, and one sees the people wandering in a state of unknowing and ignorance,\nwith few thoughts and scant desires.\nThough they possess cleverness, there is nothing for it to apply itself.\n\nAll this is the Sage’s governance through *wuwei*—\nhow could the world not be governed?\n\nThe *Six Emptinesses* say:\n*\"Do not honor the worthy, so the people do not contend.*\nFor a state must have its worthy ministers to assist in governance—\nif not, there is no way to achieve order.\nTo not honor the worthy is not to reject the worthy—\nit is merely to not exalt them.\nIf the ruler opens the door to honoring the worthy,\nthen those below will harbor ambitions to advance,\nhence it is said: *‘Do not honor the worthy, so the people do not contend.’*\n\n*Do not prize rare goods, so the people do not steal.*\nWealth and goods—all under heaven desire them.\nIf the ruler values and cherishes them,\nthen those below, though desiring them, find them hard to obtain—\nand difficulty in obtaining them stirs the private impulse to pilfer.\nIf the ruler regards wealth as common as dirt,\nneither prizing nor loving it,\nand makes goods easy to obtain,\nthen how could the people harbor thieving intentions?\n\n*Do not display what is desirable, so the heart remains undisturbed.*\nThis has two interpretations.\nOne interprets *‘see’* as the ruler not displaying what is desirable to the people,\nso their hearts naturally settle.\nIf the ruler displays what is desirable,\nthen those below will emulate it—\nhow could their hearts not be disturbed?\n\nAnother interpretation of *‘see’* speaks of self-cultivation:\nwhen music, women, and luxuries fill one’s sight,\nif one does not see what is desired, the heart remains settled.\nIf one sees what is desired, how could it not be disturbed?\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance is at its strongest in fortifying the bones.\n\nTherefore, ancient Sages governed the state by first governing themselves,\nand to govern themselves, they first emptied their hearts—\nnot allowing human desires to agitate them,\nso the heart naturally becomes empty.\n\nEmpty, still—\nthe heart still, then *qi* settles;\n*qi* settled, then the belly naturally fills.\nThus, to empty the heart, fill the belly, and weaken the will—\nthis means not competing with things.\nWithout competition, *shenqi* harmonizes and rejoices,\nand blood and essence flow abundantly, marrow fills, and bones grow strong—\nthis is the true way of nurturing life,\na certainty that must be believed.\nTo govern the state thus is to bring wealth to the nation and peace to the people—\nwhat more could one ask?\n\nTo always keep the people in a state of unknowing and desirelessness\nis to achieve perfect governance.\nYet the people’s desires are inevitable—\nhow then can one make them desireless and ignorant?\n\nStill, if the ruler does not honor the worthy, does not prize goods,\nand does not display what is desirable,\nand the people follow above as grass follows the wind,\ntheir nature returns to simplicity,\neach content in their place,\nclothed and fed, wandering at ease—\nwhat knowing, what desiring would they have?\n\nYet if the ruler’s conduct is sincere and the people remain untransformed,\neven if they have knowledge and desire, they dare not act upon it—\ntransformation is the work of many.\n\nTo act through *wuwei* is to govern completely—\nfor if the ruler exalts the worthy, prizes goods, and displays what is desirable,\nyet truly practices *wuwei*,\nthen the world will govern itself.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"To act through wuwei is to govern completely.\"*\n\nSu Jingjing said:\n*\"From ‘Do not honor the worthy, so the people do not contend’\nto ‘then there will be nothing that is not governed.’*\nThis chapter focuses on Laozi’s original intent:\n*‘Do not display what is desirable, so the heart remains undisturbed.’*\n\nThe worthy are those who excel beyond others.\nIf I exalt those who excel beyond others,\nthen those who do not excel will rise to contend.\nRare goods are treasures.\nIf I prize treasures, the people will conceive thieving intentions.\nThis is like Ji Kangzi’s concern over theft,\nwhere Confucius said:\n*\"If you yourself do not desire them,\neven if rewarded, they will not steal.\"*\nThis is the same meaning.\n\nGenerally, if the people’s desires are not displayed,\ntheir hearts naturally remain unagitated.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s *Gèn* hexagram says:\n*\"Gèn its back, it does not grasp its body;\nit walks through its courtyard, yet does not see its person—\nno blame.\"*\nThe commentators say:\n*\"Gèn* means to stop.\nThe heart’s desires are always stopped where the eyes do not see.\nThe back is where nothing is seen—\nif seen, then desire arises,\nand once desire arises, it cannot be stopped.\n*Gèn its back*—it does not grasp its body—\nmeaning it does not see its body.\nIf the eyes cannot even see the body,\nthen desire naturally does not arise.\nThough the courtyard is near and one walks past people,\nthey are not seen because *gèn* stops the back.\nIf one sees the splendor outside and takes delight,\nthen the heart becomes agitated.\nWhen external things do not intrude,\nthe heart remains undisturbed,\nand there is no fault.\nThis is Laozi’s *‘Do not display what is desirable, so the heart remains undisturbed.’*\n\nLaozi speaks of ancient Sages’ governance,\nstriving to make the people’s hearts empty, their bellies full,\ntheir wills weak, and their bones strong.\nAn empty heart means not allowing external things to disturb it.\nA full belly means merely ensuring the people are fed.\nA weak will means making the people not see what is desirable,\nso they do not contend.\nStrong bones mean merely ensuring the people have strength to bear burdens.\nIf the people are ignorant and desireless, they become simple and practical,\nforming customs naturally.\nThough there may be clever and cunning among them—\none in a hundred—\nthe simple and practical far outnumber the clever and cunning,\nso who would dare to rebel?\n\nEven today, the people of the mountains and forests differ from those of the markets and cliffs in their sincerity

      "translated_text": "「Thus the actions of the Sage are all in tranquility and non-action, and naturally all things are governed without effort. The Sage does not exalt the worthy, nor treasure rare goods—both measures ensure the people do not see what is desirable, and their hearts remain undisturbed.\n\nHow unlike the later ages, where rewards for merit and incentives for ability only provoke the world’s strife, while valuing rare and costly wealth only spawns thievery—these are not the ways of non-action and tranquil governance.\n\n*The *Shíyí* [Gathering of Lost Sayings] states: The Master of Virtue said: \"Empty the heart, fill the belly\"—this is the same as the Sage not exalting, not treasuring, and not showing what is desirable, thereby making the people ignorant and desireless. When they have no knowledge to covet, they do not dare to act.\n\nSome say \"empty the heart to nurture the Dao,\" which, though not harmful in principle, is not the true meaning of this passage.\n\n*From *Zhūzǐ Pángzhèng* [Collateral Proofs of the Masters]:\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: In the age of perfect virtue, the Sage does not exalt the worthy, nor employ the capable. The ruler is like a branch of a tree, the people like wild deer. Correctness is upheld without calling it righteousness, mutual love is practiced without calling it benevolence, substance is honored without calling it loyalty, fittingness is observed without calling it trustworthiness, and spontaneous movements are guided without calling them gifts. Thus, actions are performed without boasting, and deeds are done without seeking praise.\n\n*The *Han Feizi* says: A villager of Song found a rough piece of jade and presented it to the Lord of the State, Zi Han, who refused it. The villager said: \"This is a treasure! It should be made into a nobleman’s vessel, not used by commoners.\" Zi Han replied: \"You consider jade a treasure, but I consider not accepting your jade a treasure.\" Thus, the villager desired jade, while Zi Han did not—hence the saying, \"Desire what is not desired, and value what is difficult to obtain.\"\n\n*The *Wénzǐ* says: A true man of virtue is serene and without thought, calm and without concern. He takes heaven as his roof, earth as his carriage, the four seasons as his steeds, and yin-yang as his reins. He travels where there are no paths, wanders where there are no traces, and exits where there are no gates. To take heaven as his roof means to cover all things without limit; to take earth as his carriage means to bear all things without burden. The four seasons as steeds mean to harness all transformations; yin-yang as reins means to provide for all needs. Thus, he moves swiftly without agitation, travels far without weariness, his limbs remain still, his wisdom undiminished—yet he shines brightly throughout the world. Grasping the essence of the Dao, he gazes upon the boundless realm, so that all worldly affairs are beyond his doing. Following nature’s spontaneity, he guides it, and all changes of things are beyond his control. Seizing its core and returning to it, the Sage cultivates his inner foundation without adornment in externals, fortifying his spirit while suppressing his perceptions. Hence, he is detached and effortless yet accomplishes all things; he governs without action yet nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nWhat is meant by non-action is not to act before things; what is meant by non-governance is not to alter nature; what is meant by nothing remaining ungoverned is to follow things’ natural course.\n\nShí Tán said: Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from striving. Not treasuring rare goods prevents thievery. Not showing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed. The previous passage expounded the principle of *wúmíng* [namelessness], while this one expounds the principle of *wúdù* [desirelessness]. To exalt the worthy makes their names desirable, and the people contend for them. To treasure rare goods makes profit desirable, and the people will steal for it. Only by not showing names as desirable does the name not disturb their hearts; only by not showing profit as desirable does profit not disturb their hearts. What is desired and can disturb the heart is not limited to these two. Let these two suffice as examples.\n\nLín Yōngzhāi interpreted \"not exalting the worthy\" as \"not self-praising,\" and Huáng Màocái explained \"not showing what is desirable\" as \"not seeing that the world has what is desirable\"—both interpretations are superior.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance empties the heart, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones. When desire does not disturb the heart, the heart is empty; when the heart is not overcome by desire, it has a steadfast center and is full. Hence, \"fill the belly.\" When the will does not seek externals, the will is weak; though weak, if the *qi* is not moved by the will, the bones grow ever stronger—hence, \"strengthen the bones.\" The Sage constantly makes the people ignorant and desireless, so even those who know do not dare to act. If they are ignorant and desireless, though they may have knowledge, they have no use for it. Practicing non-action, nothing remains ungoverned. The Sage’s governance is simply non-action. Yet he can make the people not be disturbed by what is desirable—this is what is meant by \"nothing remains ungoverned.\"\n\nThe previous passage arose from the principle of *wúmíng* [namelessness], while this one arises from *wúdù* [desirelessness], yet both return to non-action. Non-action is indeed the embodiment of the Dao.\n\n*End of Volume Eight of *Zhēnyì Jiéyì* [Collected Meanings of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue]. *Beginning of Volume Nine of *Zhēnyì Jiéyì*.*」",

This chapter expounds that the wondrous origin’s function lies in action without contrivance. It begins with *Dàochōng* [The Dao’s Purity], demonstrating the principle of supreme emptiness as the root of all things. Next, it speaks of *cuòjiě* [dulling and releasing], clarifying how purity in application resolves discord, concluding with the analogy of the *Xiàngdì* [August Sovereign] to guide all to its intent.\n\n**Du Guāngtíng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Dao’s operation is boundless—vast as heaven and earth, subtle as a hair’s tip. In its natural repose, it neither lacks nor overflows. Applied to the body, it merges light and dust into unity; within the self, it transforms sharpness into harmony.

The scholars of old and those of today\nhave differing words.\n\nThe ancient **Perfect Ones** (*zhìrén*) do not pursue profit,\ndo not abandon harm,\ndo not boast of prominence,\ndo not lament obscurity,\ndo not hoard judgments of right/wrong or good/evil.\nInternally upright, they follow Heaven’s **Dao** (*Tian’s Way*),\nexternally adaptable, they follow humanity’s **Dao**.\nFilled yet luminous, they shine without dazzling,\nnever uttering abrupt or extravagant claims.\nThe so-called \"shining\" is not without harmony,\nthe so-called \"dusty\" is not without unity—\nhow could they strive to force harmony and uniformity?\nJust as Liezi dwelled in Zheng for forty years,\nand no one recognized him,\nthe king and ministers, nobles and officials,\nregarded him no differently than the common folk.\nLaozi spoke of neighboring lands where\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs could be heard,\nyet the people lived and died without ever visiting one another.\nThis may truly be called dwelling in ease and following the natural order,\nfinding their proper place.\n\nNow, there are things that blend into unity,\nborn before Heaven and Earth,\nsilent and vast,\nself-sufficient and unchanging.\nLaozi said of himself: *\"I do not know whose child I am,\nI am before the **Archetypal Sovereign** (*Xiàngdì*).\"*\nThe formless form, the symbol without substance—\nthis is the **Archetypal Sovereign** (*Shén Dì*) as the first emperor,\nthe **Dao** before any beginning.\n*\"I do not know myself\"*—then who can I say I am?\nThis is not the **Dao**’s own origin,\nyet how could it be otherwise?\nScholars should know what comes first and what follows,\nstriving earnestly to seek it out.\n\nHuang Maocai said: *\"The **Dao** is boundless, and its application reaches before the **Archetypal Sovereign**.\nYin and yang together are called **Dao**.\nBoundless is the harmony of yin and yang’s **qi**.\nIts use is like the unfilled—\nempty, yet able to respond.\nDeep, like the root of all things,\nstillness can encompass all existence.\nTo blunt its sharpness—\nnot to compete with things.\nTo untangle its confusion—\neach has its own order, yet nothing is disordered.\nTo

likened the **Dao** to filling Heaven and Earth.\nIf it is both filling and full,\nthen its fullness is manifest.\nFullness is the **Dao**’s presence in all things.\nSince fullness is honored,\nyet boundless is also honored,\nthe more one uses the **Dao**,\nthe more one should be thus.\nLike saying ‘knowing the male while guarding the female,\nknowing the white while dwelling in the black’—\nthis is having both the male and female\nyet resting in the female,\nhaving both the white and black\nyet dwelling in the black.\nThis is to be boundless in fullness,\nseeking emptiness in the midst of it.\nThus it is called **boundless application** (*chōngyòng*).\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Carve and polish to return to simplicity,\ndo not be a **nominal sage** (*míngshī*)—\na name without

(*zhīzhǔ*)—\na scholar without true understanding.\nTo exhaust what Heaven bestows\nyet show no trace of gain—\nthis is also emptiness.\nHeaven’s single nature can fully possess all things,\nyet it seems as if it has never gained anything—\nthis is to be boundless in fullness,\nseeking to reach emptiness.\nThus, the **scheming strategist**,\nthe **taskmaster**,\nthe **master of

emptiness instead?\nAll things under Heaven are born from existence,\nexistence from non-existence—\nthus non-existence is the root of all things.\nOnce one has applied the **Dao**,\nit emerges as **virtue** (*dé*),\nand **virtue** divides into\n**ren** (*仁*), **yi** (*义*), and **li** (*礼*).\nHow then can one rightly call it non-existence?\nIf one cannot contain non-existence,\nthen one should seek its nearest likeness—\nonly boundless can approach it.\n‘The unfilled’—\nthis is not truly lacking,\nmerely doubt.\n‘Seems as if it might exist’—\nthis is not daring to assert a definite

does not claim self-exaltation—\nthis is the language of humility.\n\nThis lesson teaches the world:\nif one always practices humility and centrality,\nthen one naturally avoids *highness leading to peril.*\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"He who has greatness yet knows how to be humble will surely have good fortune.\"*\nThis is the case.\n\nThus the virtuous person, hearing much,\n*restrains himself yet holds fast to it*;\nwith many aspirations,\n*refines his nature yet conceals it*;\nwith profound understanding,\n*simplifies his actions yet executes them with precision*.\nHence, when he stands above others, all revere him;\nwhen he leads, none dare to harm him.\n\nTherefore, the world willingly follows him without tiring—\nwhy is this so?\n\nIt is because of his *humility and centrality.*\n\n**Dulling the sharp.**\n*Dulling* means *restraining*.\n*Sharp* refers to *the cutting edges of speech and action*—\nwhen a person’s *qi* is sharp,\nsometimes it erupts from within,\nmanifesting in words—\nthe world calls this *lip-spears and tongue-swords*,\nand at times it wounds others more than actual blades.\n\nThus the good and virtuous person,\nhow could he not tolerate all?\nIf he constantly reflects inward,\ndulling his sharpness and restraining his *qi*,\nthen he will not recklessly harm others.\n\nThis is the meaning of *dulling the sharp.*\n\n**Untangling the tumult.**\n*Tumult* refers to *the clashing of conflicting emotions*.\n*Untangling* means *self-discipline*.\nWhen two joys arise, there will be many exaggerated praises;\nwhen two angers arise, there will be many exaggerated reproaches.\nIf the *qi* of discontent surges within,\nthen exaggerated reproaches will burst forth,\nand the two clash in resistance—\nthis is called *tumult and competition*.\n\nThus the great and virtuous person,\nconstantly restraining his discontent and checking his desires,\ndoes not fall into contention and rivalry.\n\n**Harmonizing his brilliance.**\n*Brilliance* refers to *cleverness and innate talent*.\n*Harmonizing* means *concealing and dimming*.\nTo *conceal* is to prevent cleverness from being displayed;\nto *dull* is to prevent innate talent from being revealed.\nConfucius, the greatest Sage,\nin his native village appeared as if *without words*—\nYanzi, the greatest Worthies,\nthroughout the day spoke not, as if foolish.\n\nThese are all examples of *harmonizing his brilliance*.\n\nI have heard from the ancients:\n*\"I am clever—what does cleverness avail me?\"*\n*\"I am virtuous and capable—what do virtue and capability avail me?\"*\nIf one boasts and relies upon them,\nthen one has already become small.\n\nI only lower my *qi* to humility and harmony,\nalign my heart with uprightness and restraint,\nsubmit my spirit to solemnity and reverence,\nso that even the common folk can consult me,\nand the ministers and great officials are all those I honor.\nYet I do not know that I am exalted,\nand they do not know that they are low.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"The virtuous person, when he presides over the people,\nconceals his brilliance yet makes it clear—*\nthis is the case.\"\n\n**Equalizing the dust.**\n*Dust* refers to *obscurity and vulgarity*.\n*Equalizing* means *treating all with equal benevolence*—\nto *equalize benevolence* is to have no division between *darkness in others* and *clarity in oneself*;\nto *view uniformly* is to have no distinction between *foolishness here* and *virtue there*.\n\nIn general, the Way of being a person\nvalues *lowliness as the foundation*,\n*humility as the base*—\nthus the great and virtuous person,\nconstantly concealing his brilliance and yielding to the vulgar,\ndulling his traces and blending with the dust,\nknows that the world cannot be elevated,\nso he descends;\nknows that the people cannot be surpassed,\nso he follows behind.\nWith warmth, respect, and careful virtue,\nhe makes others admire him;\nby adopting the receptive and holding low,\nnone can surpass him.\nInternally, he hides his wisdom and does not display his skills—\nthough I am exalted and high,\nothers do not harm me.\nThough the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers flow to the left,\nthey are longer than all other streams,\nbecause they can humble themselves.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"By lowering the noble and elevating the humble,\none gains the people’s loyalty.\"*\nIs this not the meaning of *harmonizing his brilliance* and *equalizing the dust*?\n\n**Profound yet like existence.**\n*Profound*—\nthis speaks of *non-existence* and *existence*,\nof *having* and *being*—\nthe Dao’s essence seems *non-existent* yet *existing*,\n*present* yet *as if lost*,\nthus it is said: *profound yet like existence.*\n\nThis is why the ancients, wise and clear-sighted,\nunderstood the Dao’s *having* and *non-having*—\nconstantly *dulling the sharp*, *untangling the tumult*,\n*harmonizing their brilliance*, and *equalizing the dust*.\n\nThen, what is the meaning of *embodying the Dao*?\nThe Dao’s teachings—\nits essence is boundless,\nits application infinite,\nits nature inherent in all things,\nneither lacking nor deficient.\nIt is obtained in human life at the beginning of *stillness*,\nmanifested in response at the moment of *natural flow*,\nnurtured in the *unaroused emotions* of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight,\nand realized when *intent and form* are both *non-existent*—\n*serene yet correct*,\n*profound yet clear*,\n*dim yet vast as the Great Emptiness without dust*,\n*flickering yet ordered as the four seasons*—\n*non-action yet all things are done.*」",

Those who speak of humans embodying the Dao and achieving absolute dependence on and alignment with its mysterious depths are not merely conforming to the ways of the world.\n\n*The Commentary on the Various Schools* states: *\"The Dao has sentiment and trustworthiness, yet it acts without form or design. It can be transmitted but not clung to*#2*, obtained but not seen. From its own root and origin, before heaven and earth existed, it has endured from antiquity. It encompasses gods and spirits, emperors and lords, giving rise to heaven and earth—yet it does not claim precedence over the Supreme Ultimate (太极), nor does it dwell beneath the Six Extremes (六极) as something profound. It precedes the birth of heaven and earth yet is not deemed ancient, and it surpasses the Upper Antiquity (上古) yet is not considered aged.*\n\nThe Stone Cavern Master (石潭) remarks: *\"The Dao is vast yet when applied may seem insufficient, deep as if it were the ancestral source of all things.*\"\n\n冲 means *emptiness/void*. Emptiness prevents fullness; emptiness without fullness means no manifestation, and no manifestation means profound depth. Hence, it is called *vast and deep*. Though it is said to be unmanifest, it is indeed the ancestral source of all things.

To *harmonize its radiance* (和其光) means to conceal its brilliance so it is not seen externally. To *align with the dust* (同其尘) means to blend with the world’s impurities without standing apart. *Luminous yet seemingly present* (湛兮似若存) conveys the Dao’s clarity and enduring presence, though it appears as if it were not always there.\n\nI do not know whose offspring this is—it precedes the Heavenly Sovereign (天帝).\n\nThe Dao is the origin and ancestral source of all things. I do not know whose offspring this Dao itself is, for even the term *ancestral source* (宗) suggests the Dao has its own origin. Yet it is further described as *preceding the Heavenly Sovereign*—where *sovereign* (帝) means the Heavenly Emperor, and *seeming* (象) implies its presence before him. Though named as the mother of all things, it is truly the beginning of heaven and earth. Heaven and earth arise from it, so the Dao precedes the Heavenly Sovereign. This shows that the Dao is not only the ancestral source of all things but also the ancestral source of heaven and earth itself.\n\nThis entire passage speaks of the Dao’s essence, not of those who embody the Dao.\n\n*End of Volume Nine of *The Collected Meanings of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* #1*\n*#1: \"若存若士\" (ruò cún ruò shì) – \"士\" (shì) is likely a scribal error for \"亡\" (wáng, \"lost/absent\").*\n*#2: \"可传而不可爱\" (kě chuán ér bùkě ài) – \"爱\" (ài) is likely a scribal error for \"受\" (shòu, \"accept/receive\").*\n\n*Volume Ten of *The Collected Meanings of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* – Observations on the Profound and Distant Dao by Master Constant Virtue (凝远大师常德路)*」",

(凝远大师常德路)**\n\n**Chapter on \"Heaven and Earth Lack Virtue\" (天地不仁章)**\n\n*Variants in Transmission:*\nThe *River Above Master* (河上公) titled this *\"Chapter on Empty Use\"* (虚用章),\nwhile *Master Zhao Shi’an* (赵实庵) called it *\"Chapter on the Just Conduct of Great Transformation\"* (大化公行义章).\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary:*\nThe preceding chapter expounds the ineffable Dao in its spontaneous, non-acting state—\nexisting in use yet without deliberate action.\n\nThis chapter reveals how partial favor breeds selfishness,\nand selfishness makes universal benevolence difficult.\nIt first likens all things to fodder and dogs,\nshowing how heaven and earth equally forget them.\nNext, it compares the space between heaven and earth to a *tuóqiào* (橐钥, bellows),\ndemonstrating how the Dao’s emptiness yields boundless function.\nIt concludes with the warning that excessive speech and action exhaust one’s essence,\nurging adherence to the central harmony of *zhōnghé* (中和).\n\n*Master Du Guangting’s (杜光庭) Observation:*\nIf one clings to \"virtue\" as virtue, then there is attachment;\nif one does not regard transformation as virtue, then there is no selfishness.\n\nThe sovereign’s gaze upon all living beings\nis like heaven and earth’s regard for all things.\nAll things arise and transform of their own accord—\nheaven and earth do not claim credit for their work.\nThe myriad folk dwell and thrive as they will—\nthe sovereign does not take merit for their sustenance.\nHe relies on the wondrous *qi* to animate and shape,\nand on the mysterious transformation to bring forth life—\nthis is the ultimate transformation.\n\nIf one speaks of their virtue and kindness,\nlogic will itself reach exhaustion.\nWhy?\nThe virtue of heaven and earth is vast—\nyet grasses and trees flourish in summer and wither in winter.\nThe virtue of the sovereign is vast—\nyet laws decree exile and execution.\nSuch virtue is not as great as that which does not cling to virtue as virtue,\nbut instead follows the natural flow and preserves the tranquil stillness—\nthe essential secret for nurturing one’s body.\n\n*Master Zhang Chongying’s (张冲应) Response:*\n\"Emptiness\" means \"voidness.\"\nThe boundless void contains no forms,\nyet between heaven and earth it moves and functions—\nwithout sound or scent,\nyet all things arise from it, endlessly.\nIf humans attune to this emptiness and employ it,\nthen the Dao will achieve nothing it cannot perfect.\n\nHeaven and earth lack virtue,\ntreating all things as fodder and dogs.\nThe sage lacks virtue,\ntreating the people as fodder and dogs.\nBetween heaven and earth,\nis it not like the bellows?\n\nThe bellows is empty within,\nyet produces sound and breath.\nEmpty yet unexhausted,\nmoving yet ever more abundant.\nExcessive speech and action lead to depletion—\nbetter to guard the central harmony.\n\n*Variant in Transmission:*\n\"Empty yet ever more abundant\" (虚而愈出) is also rendered as \"empty yet abundantly yields\" (虚而俞出).\n\n*River Above Master’s (河上公) Explanation:*\nHeaven and earth lack virtue—\nthey bestow life and transformation without sentiment,\nacting purely by nature’s course.\nThey treat all things as fodder and dogs—\nfor though heaven and earth produce all beings,\nhumans are the most precious.\nYet they regard them as mere grasses and beasts,\ndemanding no repayment in return.\n\nThe sage lacks virtue—\nthe sage nourishes the people without sentiment,\nfollowing heaven and earth’s example,\nacting by nature’s course.\nHe treats the people as fodder and dogs—\nthe sage regards them like grasses and beasts,\ndemanding no gratitude or reverence.\n\nBetween heaven and earth—\nthe space between heaven and earth is empty and tranquil,\nand harmonious *qi* flows through it,\nso all things arise spontaneously.\nIf humans eliminate desires and emotions,\nmoderate tastes and pleasures,\npurify the five viscera,\nthen the spirit will dwell within them.\n\nLike the bellows—\nthe bellows is hollow within,\nyet produces sound and breath when moved.\nEmpty yet unexhausted,\nmoving yet ever more abundant—\nit speaks of an emptiness that cannot be depleted,\nand movement that never ceases to yield sound and breath.\n\nExcessive speech leads to depletion—\nexcessive action harms the spirit,\nexcessive speech harms the body.\nWhen the tongue moves and words multiply,\ndisaster and calamity follow.\nBetter to guard the central harmony—\nbetter to cultivate virtue within,\nnourishing the spirit,\ntreating *qi* as precious,\nand speaking sparingly.\n\n*Master Wang Fusi’s (王辅嗣) Interpretation:*\nHeaven and earth lack virtue,\ntreating all things as fodder and dogs—\nfor they act by nature alone,\nwithout contrivance or design.\nAll things regulate themselves naturally,\nso heaven and earth do not interfere.\n\nIf one clings to virtue, they must contrive and impose transformations,\nentertaining thoughts and actions.\nContrived transformations cause things to lose their authenticity,\nand deliberate actions prevent their natural completion.\nIf things cannot complete naturally,\nthen they cannot fully sustain life.\n\nThe earth does not cultivate fodder for beasts,\nyet beasts eat fodder;\nthe earth does not breed dogs for humans,\nyet humans eat dogs.\nWithout action toward all things,\nyet all things find their proper place,\nand their use is never wanting.\n\nIf kindness stems from one’s own contrivance,\nit is insufficient and unreliable.\n\nThe sage lacks virtue,\ntreating the people as fodder and dogs—\nfor the sage aligns with heaven and earth’s virtue,\ncomparing the people to fodder and dogs.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe movement is boundless yet ever more abundant.\nWithin the bellows,\nthe emptiness is void of desires and actions,\nso it cannot be exhausted or depleted,\nand its movement is never spent.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe natural flow is boundless,\njust as the bellows—\nexcessive speech leads to depletion,\nyet guarding the central harmony prevents exhaustion.\nThe more one acts,\nthe more one loses.\nTo establish harm in things,\nand to misplace words in actions,\nis to invite inevitable depletion.\nIf one guards the bellows’ central harmony,\nthen there is no exhaustion,\nand if one abandons self to follow things,\nthen all will be in order.\n\nIf the bellows had intent to produce sound,\nit would fail to meet the demands of those who blow it.\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong’s (唐明皇) Commentary:*\nFrom \"Heaven and earth lack virtue\" to \"the people as fodder and dogs\"—\n\"lacking virtue\" means they do not perform acts of virtue and kindness.\n\"Fodder and dogs\" refers to the ritual practice of binding straw into dog shapes for sacrifice.\n\nDogs are kept for guarding and defense,\nso their owners expect loyalty and vigilance in return.\nBut the sacrificial dogs are mere forms,\nwithout the capacity to bark or protect—\nso their virtue is not as profound as that of the living.\n\nIt is said that heaven and earth regard humans\nas humans regard sacrificial dogs—\nwithout expectation or demand.\n\nI have examined this further:\nThe ultimate virtue knows no partiality—\nwho then embodies universal love?\nIf love is partial,\nit is not ultimate—\nit is merely selfish favor.\n\nIf one does not love only their own kin,\nthen all under heaven are kin.\nIf one does not treat only their own children as children,\nthen all under heaven are children.\n\nThus, ultimate virtue is not partial—\nit is the most inclusive.\nHow could it be universal love?\n\n*Commentary:*\n\"Virtue\" here is the natural expression of universal love.\n\"Fodder and dogs\" refers to the ritual practice of binding straw into dog shapes for sacrifice.\n\nToday, heaven and earth’s ultimate virtue\nmanifests in the creation and sustenance of all beings—\nlike humans binding straw into dog shapes,\nthey do not expect the dogs to bark or guard,\nnor do they regard their creation as an act of virtue or kindness.\nHence, it is said they lack virtue.",

position, Earth the lower—this all people know.\nThe secret interplay of yin and yang, the hidden shifts of creation—this no one can know.\n\nNow, let us liken it to the *bellies*[*tuó*] and *tubes*[*yuè*]: the Dao of Heaven and Earth is nearly contained in *wuwei*[*non-action*].\n\nEmpty and void in essence, thus it does not bend;\nEver-moving without cessation, thus it ever emerges anew.\n\nLaozi’s Dao has no inner or outer—\nto awaken to the *sacrificial-dog* teaching, one may forget the form and body;\nto grasp the principle of *bellies* and *tubes*, one may refine *jing* and *qi*.\n\nThis should be self-evident without words—\nspeak of it, and one will exhaust its meaning.\nOnly *guard-the-center* attains it.\n\nProgram Tai said: Heaven and Earth are without virtue/power, treating all things as *sacrificial dogs*.\nBinding straw into a dog’s shape—\nwhen used in sacrifice, it is honored; once the rite is done, it is cast aside.\nThis is how things may be noble or base at different times.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate and transform all things,\nyet they cyclically replace one another—\ntruly like the *sacrificial dog*.\n\nWhen rice ripens, wheat withers;\nwhen melons grow, the *qí* plant dies;\nwhen deer shed their antlers, spring and winter reverse.\nGeese and swallows depart as guests—\nsouth and north, they avoid one another.\n\nAmong all creatures, their inherent natures differ vastly—\nthus what suits one may not suit another.\nIf one governs universally,\nand yet harbors a heart of *virtue/power*,\nthen whom shall one favor?\n\nTo benefit one is to harm another,\nto profit one is to neglect a hundred—\nsuch *virtue/power* is laborious and petty.\n\nIf one aligns with the *qi* of things,\nand acts when their roots and natures align,\nthen they arise and transform themselves,\ntake form and color themselves,\nconsume and rest themselves—\nwhile Heaven and Earth seem to take no part in it.\n\nThis is *virtue/power* without *virtue/power*.\nThe sage is without *virtue/power*,\ntreating the people as *sacrificial dogs*.\nThe sage acts without intent,\nyet employs the *Great Rectification* to model Heaven and Earth.\n\nThus, though never curving to love one person,\nno one fails to receive their virtue/power.\n\nZhuangzi extended this, saying:\n*\"The most virtuous has no favorites—*\n*let me forget the world,*\n*and the world will forget me.*\nThis is the *true non-seven*[*zhēngbùqī*] virtue/power.\"\n\nThough its blessings cover all,\nthe world does not know its virtue/power—\nthis is not true forgetting.\n\nHe also said:\n*\"The sage’s love for people—*\n*if you name it for them,*\n*they will not know it as love unless told.\"*\n\nThis too spreads blessings across ages,\nyet the sage does not know it as *virtue/power*.\nThis is called *virtue/power* without *virtue/power*.\n\nIf one selects things to love,\nand extends kindness only to those within one’s favor—\nthis is like a tiger or wolf\nthat does not devour its own young.\n\n*Virtue/power* without *virtue/power*\nis not its true essence.\n\nMencius said:\n*\"Kill them, and they bear no grudge;\nbenefit them, and they do not repay.*\nThe people daily improve and distance themselves from fault,\nyet do not know who acts for them—\nthis is the method of their governance.\nTo say that plowing, digging, play, and leisure\nare not the Emperor’s doing—\nthis is how their effects manifest.\"*\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, movement is endless and ever emerges anew.\n\n*Tuó* means to regulate *yuè*[*leather bellows*];\n*yuè* is its tube.\nIn music, it is the *羽钥*[*yǔyuè*];\nin locks, it is the *管钥*[*guǎnyuè*];\nin foundry tools, it is the *橐钥*[*tuóyuè*];\nyet in essence, it is but one.\n\n*Tuó* is the belly that draws in breath and fills it,\nthen disperses it into the furnace.\n*Yuè* is the tube that receives this breath\nand exhales it to disperse it.\n\nThe pattern of one exhale and one inhale\nis the alternating movement of yin and yang as the four seasons.\n\nThus, between Heaven and Earth,\ncold and heat succeed one another as the four seasons,\nlife and death replace each other as the ages pass—\njust as the *tuóyuè* exhales and inhales.\n\nJia Yi matched the creation of yin, yang, and all things\nto the casting of metal—\nhis meaning stems from this.\n\nThe alternating exhale and inhale\nare the mutual urging of *action* and *return*.\nThe wondrous must decay into rot,\nand rot must return to the wondrous—\nthis is how things may be noble or base at different times.\n\nTo say that between Heaven and Earth is like the *tuóyuè*\nmeans that all things shaped between the two\nare formed by its inhaling and exhaling,\nits expansion and contraction.\n\nZhuangzi’s discourse on things begins:\n*\"Yin and yang intermingle to form harmony, and thus things arise.\nEbb and flow, fullness and emptiness—\none dark, one bright—\ndaily changing, monthly transforming,\never acting yet unseen in its function,\nbeginning and ending in life and death,\ncontrasting yet endless, unknown in its extremity.\"*\n\nYin and yang intermingle, and all things draw life from it—\nthis is the origin of things.\n*Action* and *return* are the progression of generation and transformation.\nEbb and flow, full and empty—\nyin and yang in motion, governing the inhale and exhale of the *tuóyuè*.\nChange and transformation, life and death—\nthings alternately becoming *sacrificial dogs*.\n\nLaozi borrowed the *tuóyuè* and *sacrificial dog* to speak of his principles;\nZhuangzi directly transmitted them in affairs.\n\nMany words exhaust meaning—\nbetter to *guard-the-center*.\n\nAll schools say this *center* is the *middle* of *Zhōngyōng*[*The Doctrine of the Mean*],\nbut Su Huangmen [*Su Xun*] disagrees:\n*\"This is the void of the *tuóyuè* dwelling in the center—*\nhis explanation is correct.\"*\n\nLaozi sought to establish a singular doctrine,\nand thus altered or replaced all the *Six Classics*’ terms for the Dao.\n\nThe *Six Classics* speak of *middle*—\nLaozi called this *good*.\nYet he never spoke of *middle* in his own book.\n\nThen what is this *middle*?\nLike the *center* of a *domain*, an *archer’s bow*, or a *ring*—\nnaming a place within things,\nnot like the *middle* of *Zhōngyōng*,\nwhich reaches the utmost and names its principle.\n\nThus, *guard-the-center*\nrefers specifically to the *center* of the *tuóyuè*,\nto be held as its pivot—\nlike the *shū* [*pivot*] attaining the *center* of the *ring*,\nto respond to the boundless.\n\nSpeakers first act and then name what they describe—\nsaying, *\"This deed’s virtue/power is all my doing.\"*\nYet when applied to the world,\nit may or may not be fitting,\nmay or may not align—\nthis cannot be certain.",

sluggish and dull,\nyet in the end, it never falters or reaches exhaustion.\nThus it is said: *\"It is better to guard-the-center.\"*\n\nDiscussing the space between heaven and earth is like speaking of *tuóyuè*—\nits rise and fall all depend on the *succession* of the *Daode*’s *forging*.\n\nThe *Daode* is the one who wields *transformations*.\nTo allow oneself to be emptied and thus yield to the *Daode*’s manipulation,\none becomes the source of the ebb and flow of *yin* and *yang*—\nfor all things with form, emptiness brings fluidity,\nfluidity allows for *inducing change*;\nsolidity brings stagnation,\nstagnation leads only to inertness.\n\nThe *tuó*’s capacity to *absorb*,\nthe *yuè*’s capacity to *exhale*,\nboth arise from their emptiness.\nWithout the *tuó*’s emptiness, there would be no way to contain its *absorbing*;\nwithout the *yuè*’s emptiness, there would be no way to effect its *exhaling*.\nIf the *tuóyuè* remains ever-empty,\nit can receive the *eternal generation* of the *Daode* as its *rise*,\nand receive the *transformations* of the *Daode* as its *fall*—\nthis is like borrowing the hollow space within the *tuóyuè*\nto illustrate that what is not stagnant can still receive.\n\nOnly because it is not stagnant\ndoes the *spreading qi* find a way to enter it.\nThe *Daode*’s *mechanism* is triggered by movement,\nand it is *stirred* to *rise*—\nthis is its ability to manipulate *generation* and *transformation*.\nBecause it remains empty yet unyielding,\nit can receive what is present\nand manifest it in the world.\n\nThe *yin* and *yang qi* hides

emptiness allows for reception,\nits reception does not cling—\nit mirrors the *symbol* of all things entering and exiting the *mechanism*,\nso this *mechanism* never ceases,\nand *rise* and *fall* are endless.\n\nThus, the one who remains *still* and *unmoving*\nis able to respond to sensation and thereby attain fluidity.\n\nDiscussing the marvel of the *tuóyuè*\nis nearly akin to the *Gu shén*—\nyet it cannot be fully aligned with it.\nThe *Gu shén* can *self-regulate* existence and non-existence,\nwhile the *tuóyuè*’s *exhaling* and *absorbing*\nstill depend on the *Daode*’s *transformation*.\nWhen *stirred* to *exhale*,\nit differs from *self-receiving* and *self-responding*—\nthus this chapter speaks of the *tuóyuè*,\nand the next chapter turns to the *Gu

\"repeatedly.\"\n*Shǒu zhōng* (守中) means silently closing one’s mouth.\nIt means:\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth cannot be fully expressed in words;\nexcessive speech repeatedly leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to remain silent and forget words.\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"I wish to speak not at all.\"*\nWhat speech can Heaven have?\nThe four seasons move within it,\nmyriad things are born within it.\nThis is the same meaning.\n\nYet the sage’s words are pure and easily understood,\nwhile this text oscillates wildly, making it difficult to grasp.\nSome may say it warns against excessive speech,\nbut this contradicts the chapter’s intent.\n\nIf one sees through this,\nnot only does the beginning and end cohere,\nthe meaning becomes clear,\nbut its language is also concise, profound, and ancient—\nhow could this be easily attained?\n\nFan Yingyuan said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating myriad things as *chúgǒu*.*\n*Virtue* is the principle of love.\nIt is said that Heaven and Earth’s nurturing is vast,\nyet they do not speak of virtue—\ntoward myriad things, it is like binding straw into a dog for sacrifice.\nBefore it is presented, it is carried in a wicker basket,\ncovered with embroidered cloth—\nnot out of love, but because of the occasion.\nOnce the sacrifice is complete,\npassersby trample its head and back,\nfirewood gatherers take it for fuel—\nnot that they do not love it,\nbut because of the occasion.\nSpring and summer nurture growth,\nlike the *chúgǏu* before presentation;\nautumn and winter wither and fall,\nlike the *chúgǒu* after discard—\nall is the work of the seasons.\nHow could it be that they love in spring and summer\nbut do not love in autumn and winter?\nWhen *qi* arrives, myriad things act without knowing why—\nthe sage is without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*.\nThe sage embodies this Dao to universally love,\nhis virtue is thus supreme.\nYet he does not speak of virtue—\ntoward the people, it is like Heaven and Earth toward myriad things:\naiding their natural unfolding without harm,\nensuring life and death proceed without regret,\nso they do not know the Emperor’s power over them.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, the more it moves, the more it produces.\nThe bag is called *tuó*, the bamboo tube is called *kǒu*.\nIn smelting, the *kǒu* connects the *tuó* to channel *qi* and blow the furnace fire.\n*Qū* (屈) means \"bent.\"\n*The Yīn Biàn* says: *\"Yú\"* (俞) is pronounced as *\"yáng zhū\"* (羊朱).\nFù Yì cites *Guang Yǎ*: *\"Yú\"* means \"benefit.\"\nThe *Han Shǐ* records the people’s suffering and hardship as *\"yú\"* (俞).\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, it is only empty and flowing—\nlike the bamboo tube channeling *qi*,\nempty yet unbent—\nwhen *qi* comes, it passes through;\nwhen *qi* departs, it does not accumulate.\nIt is like the *tuó* wind:\nthe more it moves, the more it produces.\nOnce the furnace’s materials are refined into forms,\nthe *tuó* and *kǒu* never speak of virtue or love.\n\nExcessive speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to uphold the central emptiness of Heaven and Earth,\nwithout deviation, so that myriad things naturally find their place.\nHow could there be exhaustion?\n\nXué Yǒngzhāi said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*.*\nHeaven and Earth nurture myriad things\nyet harbor no intent toward them.\nThe sage nourishes the people\nyet harbors no intent toward them.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, the more it moves, the more it produces.\nThe *tuó* and *kǒu* remain unobstructed in their emptiness,\nthus the more they move, the more sound they produce.\nHeaven and Earth’s ability to transform and nurture myriad things without exhaustion\nlies in their emptiness and their ability to move.\nExcessive speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to uphold the central emptiness.\"\n\nHuì Shī’s eloquence\nis not as good as Yán Zhī’s silent cultivation.\n\nXiū Xiū’ān said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*—*\n*until it is better to uphold central emptiness.*\nThe *chúgǒu* is a straw dragon bound for sacrifice,\nenclosed in a red lacquered case,\ncovered with embroidered cloth—\nonce the sacrifice ends, it is discarded.\nHeaven and Earth, the sage—\nthey embody the marvel of *wuwei*,\nnurturing myriad things without expecting gratitude,\nnot claiming ownership,\nallowing things to transform naturally,\nlike the *chúgǒu*—\nthus it seems as though they are without virtue.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, it is empty like a *tuó* bag,\n*qi* flows and runs, nurturing myriad things.\nA clear and empty mind is likewise so.\nA spontaneous spark of insight,\nendless wondrous application—\nthis is called empty yet unbending,\nmoving yet ever producing.\nThe *tuó* is the *tuó* bag,\nthe *kǒu* is the tube—\ninstruments for stirring wind and movement.\nThough this metaphor illustrates the marvel of transformation,\nexcessive speech only distances one from the Dao.\nEven with great eloquence and repeated analogies,\nmetaphors are limited in number,\nwhile this Dao is beyond all metaphor—\nbetter to remain silent.\nThe subtlety of upholding central emptiness\ncan reveal the penetration of transformation.\n\nChǔ Bóxiù said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*—*\n*until it is better to uphold

straw shaped as a dog for sacrifice,\nbefore sacrifice it is adorned with love and respect,\nafterward discarded and trampled—\nits creation and destruction are mere transformations,\nnot rooted in

bellows and windbox.\nThis also speaks of its lack of intention.\nThe bellows and windbox, when activated,\nblow air through the pipes—\nlike the circulation of *qi* in yin and yang,\nbreathing without pause.\nAll beings and things are cast in its molding.\nOnly when it remains centrally empty and unobstructed\ndoes its movement of *qi* flow ever outward.\nThis principle harmonizes perfectly with the transformations of creation—\nwhy speak further, only to exhaust oneself?\nBetter to uphold the bellows and windbox within oneself,\nto explore the Heaven and Earth within,\nfor where is the logic of generating all things?\n\nSome interpret the excessive words of the restless as an explanation,\nbut this does not align with the context above and below.\nThe core meaning of this passage lies in *\"upholding centrality.\"*\nThe profound truth is so subtle and mysterious\nthat only scholars who practice diligently\ncan verify within themselves the presence of a Heaven and Earth—\nfor it exists within the human body alone.\n\n**Niu Miaozhuan said:**\nHeaven and Earth are not-ren,\ntreating all things as bound straw-dogs.\nYet the great virtue of Heaven and Earth is *generation*—\nunceasing generation is called *ren*.\n*Ren* is the virtue of Heaven and Earth’s creation.\nYet it says \"not-ren\"—\nmeaning Heaven and Earth do not possess virtue for themselves.\nAll things are the myriad kinds filling Heaven and Earth.\nThe bound straw-dog refers to ancient sage-kings’ sacrifices,\nwhere straw was bound into dog-shaped offerings—\n*Shu* (刍) being reeds or thatch.\nThough reeds are humble, their use is weighty;\nthe dog, a domesticated beast,\nholds the *xu* (戌) position and corresponds to *Qian* (乾).\nThus, ancient people shaped reeds into dogs for

Heaven and Earth truly viewed all things\nas mere straw and beasts,\nthen they would be selfishly hoarding their own greatness—\nwould that not be *not-ren*?\nThis is my shallow understanding.\nThe

this.\nFormerly, the Grand Secretary Ding Yìdōng, of the Taifu Temple and the Chancellery, annotated it.\n\n**Annotations on Differences:**\nMaster Héshànggōng composed *The Chapter on Manifestation*.\nZhào Shí’ān composed *The Chapter on Nourishing the Sacred Root*.\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng’s Commentary:\nThe previous chapter clarified that excessive particularity leads to private bias—\npartiality makes universality difficult.\nThis chapter elucidates the utmost emptiness yet responsive—\nits responsiveness is inexhaustible.\n\nIt begins with the **Valley Spirit**,\nentrusting the spirit’s function to illuminate the Dao.\nNext, it speaks of the **Mysterious Female**,\ndistinguishing the primal source of mysterious operation.\nIt concludes with **endless subtlety**,\ndemonstrating that emptiness in response requires no labor.\n\nMaster Dù Guāngtíng said:\nThe **Spirit** is what lies beyond the measure of yin and yang.\n\nEmpty yet responsive,\nsensitive yet spontaneously harmonious.\n\nSome interpret **\"Valley Spirit\"** as **nourishment**—\nnourishing the spirit aligns with immortality.\nOthers explain it as **echoing response**—\nresponding to things like the inexhaustible spirit,\nthe Mysterious Female as inhaling and exhaling the primal harmony.\n\nRefining the spirit and qi,\nprolonging form and breath,\nharmonizing with Heaven and Earth’s numinous essence,\nendlessly enduring—\nthis is the Dao of longevity.\n\nZhang Chōngyìng said:\nBetween Heaven and Earth, each inhalation and exhalation\nis where the **refined essence-qi** circulates.\n\nThe nose receives yang and forms its image;\nthe mouth receives yin and forms its image.\nWithout mouth and nose, yin and yang’s essence-qi\ncould not ascend and descend, above and below,\nand the image could not manifest.\nThis chapter opens the insight of yin and yang’s ascent and descent.\n\n**The Valley Spirit does not

spirits:\nThe liver stores the **hun** (ethereal soul),\nthe lungs store the **pò** (corporeal soul),\nthe heart stores the **shén** (spirit),\nthe kidneys store the **jīng** (essence),\nthe spleen stores the **zhì** (will).\nWhen the five viscera are all injured, the five spirits depart—\nthis is called the **Mysterious Female**.\nIt speaks of the existence of non-death\nlying within the

the stomach.\nThe five natures, coarse and debased,\nbecome the form, flesh, bones, blood, vessels, and six emotions.\nIts **ghost** is called the **pò**.\nThe **pò** is feminine, governing entry and exit through the mouth,\nharmonizing with Heaven and Earth—\nthus, it is called **Female**.\n\nThe **gate of the Mysterious Female**—\nthis is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.\n*Root* means

preserved yet nonexistent.\nIts use requires no labor—\nbreathing should always be relaxed,\nnever hasty or strained.\n\nMaster Wáng Fǔsì said:\n**The Valley Spirit does not die**—\nthe **Valley** is the central void, without grain,\nwithout form or shadow,\nwithout resistance or obstruction,\ndwelling low yet unmoving,\nguarding stillness without decay.\nThe **Valley** accomplishes its purpose unseen—\nthis is the utmost substance.\nDwelling low yet unnamed,\nit is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nEndlessly preserved,\nits use requires no labor.\nThe **gate** is where the

Dao,\n*Pin* [牝] is the origin of all things.\n\nSeeking it within myself,\nwhat substance is it, indeed?\nSeeking it and finding it impossible,\nthen seeking what gives birth to my body,\nwhat substance is that, indeed?\n\nHeaven and Earth and I all originate from the Mysterious Feminine;\nknowing what gives birth to my body,\none then knows the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"Deep-rooted and firm-founded,\nthe Dao of long life and enduring vision—\nthis is it.\"*\n\nContinuous as if ever-present,\nits use requires no effort.\n\"Continuous\" means successive.\n\"Continuous as if ever-present\"\nalso describes the Dao of the undying.\n\nThe superior scholar hears the Dao,\nand diligently practices it.\nNow, why is its use without effort?\nThe diligent have moments when they are not diligent,\nbut those who use it without effort\nare never not diligent—\nthis aligns with the Dao.\n\nThere is no greater diligence than this.\n\nChéng Tàizhī [程泰之] says:\n*\"The Grain Spirit does not die.\"*\nThe Master Lao had many allusions to the Grain,\nsaying: *\"Vast as the Valley, for its breadth,\"*\nand *\"The Valley receives One and is filled,\"*\nspeaking of its capacity to receive.\n*\"Be the Valley of the world,\"*\n*\"The rivers and seas can be kings of all the Valleys,\"*\nall praise its virtue of humility.\n\nYet this chapter uniquely reveals profound truths:\nthe Spirit, the undying,\nthe ever-present—\nits deepest meaning and practical application\nare not the same as other texts that merely liken the Grain.\n\nOther schools offer no further insight,\nonly saying that the Grain’s emptiness\nis indeed the Spirit,\nbut emptiness alone is insufficient.\nFollowing its undying nature,\nits ever-presence,\nand contemplating its essence,\none sees that emptiness alone\ncannot fully capture its description.\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng of the Tang [唐明皇] explained it thus:\n*\"It responds to sensation—\nits response is like the Spirit,\nfor it is the very meaning of sound producing echo.\"*\n\nOther schools, having followed the Emperor’s revelation,\nlater began to cite his interpretation\nas their own insight.\nBefore this, none had spoken of it.\n\nThe echo’s generation with form’s shadow\nshares the same principle.\nYet shadows cast by form are not identical—\nwhether by sun, moon, water, or fire,\nall things with light produce shadows.\nThus, if one seeks the origin of shadows,\nthey look to the sun and moon but find none,\nthen turn to water and fire,\nand the principle can be made clear.\n\nBut sound’s emergence differs.\nWhen released into the wild, it disperses;\nwhen striking the mountains, it is muffled.\nOnly the Grain—\nexteriorly curved, interiorly hollow—\nwhen sound enters it,\nresonates back and forth,\nand thus harmonizes to produce echo.\nTherefore, though Heaven is vast\nand all things are many,\nonly this Grain can produce echo from the void,\nand thus possess this Spirit.\n\nSwift or fine, long or short,\nmuch or little—\nit responds to sensation and generates,\neach instance resembling the original.\nIf not taken from this Grain,\nwhere else could one find the Spirit?\n\nOnly when one knows the Spirit belongs to this\ndoes it become undying and ever-present,\nand all can be deduced.\n\nIt was only when Dàchāng [大昌] grasped this principle\nthat he felt it was fitting yet dared not assert it deeply,\nuntil he encountered the *Listed Child* [列子] citing the Yellow Emperor’s words\nto elucidate the Master Lao’s teachings,\nand then he was firmly convinced beyond doubt.\n\nThe *Listed Child*’s words on transformation\nfully cite the Yellow Emperor’s original discourse on the Grain Spirit,\nto prove that the continuous generation and transformation\nis the Grain’s ability to be the Spirit,\nto be undying,\nto be ever-present—\nall are named by this.\n\nFurther, he explains that all things’ birth and death\ncome from entering and exiting the mechanism,\nand he cites the Yellow Emperor’s words to clarify:\n*\"Form moves but does not generate form—\nit generates shadow.\nSound moves but does not generate sound—\nit generates echo.\nThe Void moves but does not generate the Void—\nit generates the Having.\"*\n\nThe principle he aligns with\nis perfectly consistent with earlier teachings.\nThus, Dàchāng saw that the Yellow Emperor’s two meanings\nwere originally one chapter,\nbut the *Listed Child*’s phrasing\nhappened to diverge slightly,\nso he also split them into two.\n\nThe reader must combine their differing expressions\nto trace the underlying thread,\nand then clarity will emerge.\n\nAs for the Grain’s ability to be the Spirit,\nit can be deduced.\n\nWhen it is hollow,\nin the Dao it is the Void.\nWhen sound strikes it,\nit responds to sensation and thus has substance.\nThe Having moves and strikes the Void,\nthe Void receives and thus is hollow,\nso the Grain responds to sound and generates echo—\nthe image of generation without self-generation.\n\nWhen sound ceases and striking stops,\nthe Void remains void in perception,\nand the Spirit cannot always be the Spirit.\nIf there is further striking,\nits response is as before,\nand then one knows that transformation\ndoes not transform itself.\n\nThis is why it attains\nthe undying and the ever-present.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* [《易》] says:\n*\"Without thought,\nwithout action,\nquietly unmoving,\nresponsive and thus communicating—\nthis is Heaven’s way.\"*\n\nIts lack of thought and action,\nits quiet stillness,\nare the Grain’s image of Void without sensation.\nWhen sensation comes, it immediately responds,\nproducing echo and answering sound—\nthis is the unmeasurable Spirit.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* speaks of divination’s Spirit,\nsaying: *\"It is about to act,\nit is about to move—\nask it, and it will respond as if receiving a command,\nwith no distinction between near and far, deep or shallow,\nand thus one knows the coming thing.\"*\n\nDivination’s response as if receiving a command\nis the *Classic of Changes*’s sensation and communication.\nThus, it also borrows the metaphor of echo and response.\n\nThe Master Lao’s book stands alone,\nrefusing to be confused with the *Classic of Changes*,\nso though he extols this Grain’s Spirit greatly,\nhe does not directly imitate the *Classic of Changes*’s echo and response.\n\nYet in seeking its principle,\nthere is no difference.\n\nThe *Listed Child* truly had insight here,\ncombining the Yellow Emperor’s and Lao’s teachings\nto reveal their harmony,\nand then the principle became clear.",

      "translated_text": "「Thus it is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝]. The *Master of the Yellow River* [河上公] in his *Commentary* [《章句》] explains that *Grain* [谷] refers to the *nourishing sound* [育], meaning *nourishment* [养]. When humans can *nourish their Spirit* [养神], then they do not *perish* [死].\n\nThe *Spirit* [神] here refers to the *Spirits of the Five Viscera* [五藏之神]:\n- the *Liver Spirit* [肝] harbors the *ethereal soul* [魂],\n- the *Lungs Spirit* [肺] harbors the *corporeal soul* [魄],\n- the *Heart Spirit* [心] harbors the *Spirit* [神],\n- the *Kidneys Spirit* [肾] harbors the *Essence* [精],\n- the *Spleen Spirit* [脾] harbors the *Will* [志].\n\nWhen humans can *cleanse and still their form within the Great Emptiness* [清静虚空], *nourishing their Spirit* [以养其神], and not be *defiled by the myriad desires* [不为诸欲所染], their *form remains whole and their Spirit intact* [使形完神全], and thus they do not *perish* [死]. But if one *entangles with emotions and lingers in indulgence* [触情耽滞], *disturbed by the myriad phenomena* [为诸境所乱], their *form decays and their Spirit departs* [使形残神去], then how can the *Dao* [道] be preserved?\n\nThe *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门] is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth* [天地根]. The *Great Emptiness* [太虚] and *Creation* [造化] are the means by which *all things enter and exit* [万类之以出入]. Since there is the name of *entry and exit* [出入], it is called the *Gate* [门]. Moreover, *Root* [根] means *origin* [元], and the *Gate* [之门] refers to the *two nostrils* [两鼻], which serve as the passage for the *Essential Qi of Heaven and Earth* [天地之元气] to circulate within the body.\n\nThe earlier statement that *Grain’s Spirit does not perish* [谷神不死] exhorts humans to *the principle of nourishing the Spirit* [养神之理], while this passage on the *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门] illustrates *the technique of refining the form* [炼形之术]. Thus, those who *perfectly nourish both form and Spirit* [形神俱妙] alone may *align with the Dao* [与道同].\n\nHumans possess both *form* [身] and *Spirit* [神], and thus they have *birth and death* [生有死]. With *birth and death* [生有死], one cannot speak of the *Dao* [道]. *Flowing and shifting without constancy* [流动无常], how can it be called *stillness* [静]? If one *empties their form and Spirit* [空其形神], *forgets the distinction between self and things* [忘其物我], then *their exit lacks a root* [出无根], and thus *the Qi does not gather to form life* [气聚不以为生]; *their entry lacks an orifice* [入无窍], and thus *the Qi does not disperse to cause death* [气散不以为死]. Without *life* [生] or *death* [死], this is the *Spirit of Grain* [谷神]. *Birth and death are without constancy* [生死无常], for they are but *floating and shifting things* [浮动之物]. *Deeply hidden and feminine stillness* [幽深雌静], *serene and unmoving* [湛然不动], is what is meant by the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝].\n\n*Continuous as if ever-present* [绵绵若存], yet *its use requires no exertion* [用之不勤]. *Continuous* [绵绵] describes its unending nature—this passage ties together the earlier teachings on *nourishing the Spirit and refining the form* [结上养神炼形之义].\n\nTo *nourish the Spirit* [养神] is to attain *profound subtlety and hidden stillness* [深妙冥极], *cleansing and emptiness* [清静虚空], *continuous as if ever-present* [绵绵若存], yet *responding to things without ceasing* [感物而起], *uninterrupted in time* [无有绝时].\n\nTo *refine the form* [炼形] is to *breathe in the harmonious Great Emptiness* [呼吸太和], *guide and connect the blood and Qi* [导接血气], *drink the elixir of the endless spring* [饮难终之泉], and *chew the herb of longevity* [咀延年之草], so that *their limbs and joints remain unobstructed* [使其支节通畅] and *they experience no exertion* [而不勤劳]. Only then can they *share the same root as Heaven and Earth* [与天地同根] and *enter the same gate as all marvels* [众妙共门].\n\n*Master Xie Tuonan* [谢图南] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is the *ineffable function’s non-exertion* [至用之不动]. The *Classic* [经] states: *Grain is filled by the One* [谷得一以盈], *Spirit is made agile by the One* [神得一以灵]; *Heaven and Earth possess this* [天地有之], and *humans also possess it* [人亦有之].\n\n*Master Chen Xiyi* [陈希夷] says: *Mountains fall from Heaven’s heights* [山自天之上而坠], so when one *observes the trigram *Kān* [艮] and its lines* [画], one knows *mountains originate from Heaven* [山自天来]. The *human head symbolizes Heaven’s apex* [人之首象天顶], called *Kunlun* [昆仑]. The *nose and mouth are the roots of mountains* [鼻口山根], and the *Spirit dwells between them* [神藏其间], thus it is called *Grain’s Spirit* [谷神], the *master of the body* [一身之主宰]. Indeed, it *never truly perishes* [实未尝死].\n\nThe *Mysterious Female* [玄牝] refers to the *Two Primordial Elements* [乾坤二元]. The *head* [首] is *Kān* [乾], the *abdomen* [腹] is *Kūn* [坤]; the *Qi of these two elements ascends and descends, circulating* [二元之气升降往来], called *Mysterious* [玄] when in *Kān* [乾], and *Feminine* [牝] when in *Kūn* [坤]. The *Mysterious Female* [玄牝] is the *Qi of the Two Primordial Elements* [二元之气], and the *Two Primordial Elements* [二元] are the *masters of Grain’s Spirit* [谷神之主].\n\n*Master Shao Kangjie’s* [邵康节] poem states:\n*\"One thing originally has a body, a body still has a Heaven and Earth\"* [一物元来有一身，一身还有一乾坤].\nThis is precisely what is meant.\n\nThe *Gate* [门] refers to the *two nostrils* [两鼻]. The *pure and tranquil Qi of Heaven and Earth* [天地清宁之气] enters through the *human nostrils* [自人之鼻], *circulating and permeating the body* [流布身中]. The *head* [乾首] and *abdomen* [坤腹] are both *nourished by this* [胥此养之], hence it is called the *Root* [根]. The *Qi’s continuous entry* [是气之入], *unending as if ever-present* [绵绵不绝若存], is *preserved by following its natural flow* [顺其自然而存之], requiring *no exertion* [不必劳力].\n\nThus it is said: *Its use requires no exertion* [用之不勤]. Some may *overclose their Qi* [过於闭其气], which is not only *without benefit* [非徒无益] but also *harmful* [而又害之]. Indeed, it has been discussed: *The Great Ultimate* [太极] *begins to differentiate* [肇分], and humans stand alongside Heaven and Earth as *the Three Talents* [三]. This is the *Dao of the Three Talents* [三才之道].\n\nThe *head* [首] is Heaven, the *abdomen* [腹] is Earth, and the *heart* [心] resides between them—*the Three Talents within the human body* [吾身之三才]. *Master Shao Kangjie’s* [康节] poem states:\n*\"Heaven divides Creation within the One, humans weave the loom from the heart’s apex\"* [天向一中分造化，人从心上起经纶].\nThe *heart* [心] resides between the *head* [首] and *abdomen* [腹], *weaving the threads of the above and below* [以弥纶上下], so that the *Mysterious Female ascends and descends* [使玄牝升降], the *Spirit and Qi circulate* [精神往来], and thus *the body may endure perpetually* [吾身可以常存矣].\n\nWhen *preservation and nourishment are profound* [存养既深] and *understanding and recognition are mature* [体认既熟], then *it appears vague and indistinct* [惚兮恍兮], yet *therein lies an image* [其中有象], *indistinct and vague* [恍兮惚兮], yet *therein lies a thing* [其中有物], *deep and hidden* [窈兮冥兮], yet *therein lies a precision* [其中有精]. These three may be *perceived* [可识].\n\n*It cannot be seen* [视之不见], thus it is called *Yí* [夷];\n*it cannot be heard* [听之不闻], thus it is called *Xī* [希];\n*it cannot be grasped* [搏之不得], thus it is called *Wēi* [微].\nThese three may be *imagined* [可想].\n\n*Know its masculine aspect* [知其雄], yet *hold to its feminine aspect* [守其雌];\n*know its white* [知其白], yet *hold to its black* [守其黑];\n*know its prosperity* [知其荣], yet *hold to its adversity* [守其辱].\nThese three may be *preserved* [可存].\n\nWhen one *reverses their gaze inward and inspects* [反观内察], *Heaven and Earth resemble oneself* [天地与我相似]. Is it not true that *The Spirit of Grain does not perish* [谷神不死], and *Master Lao* [老氏] does not *deceive me* [欺我]?\n\n*Master Lin Yinshi* [林鬳斋] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is the *ineffable function’s non-exertion* [至用之不勤]. This section arises from *one practice of cultivation and nourishment* [修养一项功夫之所自出]. *Master Lao’s* [老子] original intent, however, was not *exclusively for cultivation and nourishment* [却不专为修养].\n\n*Essence* [精] is *substantial* [实], *Spirit* [神] is *ethereal* [虚]. *Grain* [谷] refers to *the ethereal* [虚].」",

      "original_text": "谷神者，虚中之神者也。 言人之神自虚中而出，故常存而不死。 玄，远而无极者也。 牝，虚而不实者也。 此二字只形容一个虚字。 天地亦自此而出，故曰根。 绵绵，不已、不绝之意。 若存者，若有若无也。 用於虚无之中，故不劳而常存，即所谓虚而不屈，动而愈出是也。 晦翁曰：至妙之理，有生生之意存焉。 此语亦好，但其意亦近於养生之论。 此章虽可以为养生之用，而初意实不专主是也。 范应元曰：谷神不死，是谓玄牝。 谷神，犹言虚灵也。 不死，犹言无极也。 玄牝，言其生物而不见其所以生也。 谓虚灵无极，此乃生物之牝，而不见其所以生，故曰玄。 谷神二字，傅奕云幽而通也。 司马温公曰：中虚故曰谷，不测故曰神。 苏曰：谷至虚而犹有形，谷神则虚而无形也。 虚而无形尚无有生，安有死邪？ 谓之谷神，言其德也； 谓之玄牝，言其功也。 牝生万物而谓之玄，焉见其生之而不见其所以生也。 玄牝之门，是谓天地根。 门者，指阴阳也。 以其一辟一阖，往来不穷而言也。 阴阳者，以道之动静而言也。 动而曰阳，动极而静曰阴，动极而静，静极复动，开阖不忒，生育无穷。 根者，谓天地本於此也。 人能於此心之初得之，则知天地之根，无根之根也； 玄牝之门，无门之门也； 谷神，不神之神也。 岂有穷尽哉？ 绵绵若存，用之不勤。 谓谷神之在天地，绵绵密密而无极也。 然视之不可见，听之不得闻，用之不可既，故曰若存，天地用之而四时行、百物生，未尝劳也。 谷神在人亦然。 绵绵密密，生生无穷，以为本无孰主此身，以为本有竟居何所？ 故曰若存。 善用之者未尝劳也，何有终穷哉？ 此章宜深体之，或有专就修养上解者，然必须认得谷神方可。 薛庸斋曰：谷神不死至是谓天地根。 谷者，神所居。 神者，形所载。 以形养气，以气含神，不死之道也。 神本无死，赋于形而有死，虽死而未尝死也。 谷神因玄牝不死，天地以玄牝为根。 玄牝者内焉，而藏精外焉，而调息一开一阖，一呼一吸，呼则至於深根，吸则至於固蒂。 於是有神入焉，离斗辗历天廷，骑日月披云雾，腾腾乎会归于大有之室，亦犹姑射山有神人居焉。 绵绵若存，用之不勤。 绵绵，调息似有若无，用之要不至勤劳尔。 休休庵曰：谷神不死至用之不勤。 虚明谓之谷，灵妙谓之神。 虚明灵妙无穷谓之不死，即玄牝也。 玄者，大道也。 牝者，母也。 一气生於虚明之中，然后分清浊立天地，故云玄牝之门，是谓天地根。 妙道无为，一气运行不绝，是谓绵绵若存。 应时应机，利生济物，不劳而办，故云不劝。 虚明灵妙，在人曰心。 心为万法王，能生育天地，运行日月，玄机妙用，任运无穷，随缘应感，不劳而办，悟明者不言而知已。 褚伯秀曰：谷神不死至用之不勤。 谷虚而善应，神灵而无方，人能以至灵之物藏至虚之所，则随感而应。 应已无迹，生尚不知，死乎何有？ 玄谓道妙难测，牝乃化育之地。 其为用也，妙万物而能生生，是之谓不死。 此发明虚心养神之道，借天地造化为言，始於虚心而任化，终於无心而化自己出。 凡物之生，本莫不由斯，故称门焉。 庄子云：天门者，无有也二万物出於无有。 以《易》言即太极，以人言即性。",
      "translated_text": "The *Spirit of Grain* [谷神] is the *divine essence within the void* [虚中之神者也]. It is said that *human spirit emerges from the void* [人之神自虚中而出], hence it *endures perpetually without perishing* [故常存而不死].\n\n*Mysterious* [玄] is that which is *remote and boundless* [远而无极者也]. *Feminine* [牝] is that which is *void and unsubstantial* [虚而不实者也]. These two characters merely describe the *void* [虚].\n\n*Heaven and Earth* [天地] arise from this, hence it is called the *root* [根]. *Continuous* [绵绵] conveys the meaning of *unceasing, unbroken* [不已、不绝]. *As if existing* [若存] means *as if present, as if absent* [若有若无]. When applied within the *void and nothingness* [虚无之中], it *endures without labor* [不劳而常存], thus it is said: *void yet unyielding, in motion yet ever emerging* [虚而不屈，动而愈出].\n\n*Master Huì* [晦翁] says: *The most wondrous principle* [至妙之理] contains the *intent of eternal generation* [有生生之意存焉]. This passage is well-phrased, though its meaning leans toward *theories of nourishing life* [养生之论]. Though this chapter may be applied to *cultivation and nourishment* [修养], its original intent was not *exclusively for this purpose* [实不专主是].\n\n*Master Fàn Yīngyuán* [范应元] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is called *the Mysterious Feminine* [是谓玄牝]. *The Spirit of Grain* [谷神] is akin to *void luminosity* [犹言虚灵也]. *Not perishing* [不死] is akin to *boundlessness* [犹言无极也]. *The Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝] speaks of *that which generates all things yet remains unseen in its generation* [言其生物而不见其所以生也]. It is said: *void luminosity, boundlessness*—this is the *feminine principle of generation* [虚灵无极], which is unseen in its generation, hence it is called *mysterious* [玄]. *The Spirit of Grain* [谷神]—*Fù Yì* [傅奕] says it is *profound yet penetrating* [幽而通也].\n\n*Sīmǎ Wēngōng* [司马温公] says: *It is called Grain because it is centrally void* [中虚故曰谷], *it is called Spirit because it is unfathomable* [不测故曰神]. *Sū* [苏] says: *Grain is supremely void yet still retains form* [谷至虚而犹有形], *but the Spirit of Grain is void and formless* [谷神则虚而无形也]. If it is *void and formless*, how could there be *anything to die* [虚而无形尚无有生，安有死邪]? Calling it *the Spirit of Grain* [谷神] speaks of its *virtue* [言其德也]; calling it *the Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝] speaks of its *function* [言其功也]. The *Mysterious Feminine* generates all things yet *remains unseen in its generation* [牝生万物而谓之玄], how could one see its generation without seeing *how it generates* [焉见其生之而不见其所以生也]?\n\n*The Gate of the Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝之门] is called *the root of Heaven and Earth* [是谓天地根]. *Gate* [门] refers to *yin and yang* [指阴阳也]. It is said that *one opening, one closing*—*endless coming and going* [以其一辟一阖，往来不穷而言也]. *Yin and yang* [阴阳者] are spoken of in terms of *the Dao’s motion and stillness* [以道之动静而言也]. When in motion, it is called *yang* [动而曰阳]; when motion reaches its extreme and stillness ensues, it is called *yin* [动极而静曰阴]. Motion reaching its extreme turns to stillness, stillness reaching its extreme turns back to motion—*opening and closing without error* [动极而静，静极复动，开阖不忒], *generation and nurture without end* [生育无穷]. *Root* [根] means *Heaven and Earth originate from this* [谓天地本於此也].\n\nIf a person *first attains this in their heart* [人能於此心之初得之], they will know that *the root of Heaven and Earth is a root without root* [天地之根，无根之根也]; *the Gate of the Mysterious Feminine is a gate without gate* [玄牝之门，无门之门也]; *the Spirit of Grain is a spirit without spirit* [谷神，不神之神也]. How could it ever be exhausted?\n\n*Continuous, as if existing* [绵绵若存], *used without exertion* [用之不勤]. It is said that *the Spirit of Grain in Heaven and Earth is continuous and boundless* [谓谷神之在天地，绵绵密密而无极也]. Yet *it cannot be seen when viewed* [然视之不可见], *cannot be heard when listened to* [听之不得闻], *cannot be exhausted when used* [用之不可既], hence it is said: *as if existing*—*Heaven and Earth use it, and the four seasons proceed, all things flourish, yet they never labor* [故曰若存，天地用之而四时行、百物生，未尝劳也]. The *Spirit of Grain in humans* [谷神在人] is likewise.\n\n*Continuous and boundless* [绵绵密密], *eternally generating* [生生无穷], *as its origin*—who could claim dominion over this body? *As its origin*—where could it ultimately reside? Hence it is said: *as if existing* [故曰若存]. Those who *skillfully use it* [善用之者] *never labor* [未尝劳也], how could it ever be exhausted? This chapter should be *profoundly understood* [宜深体之]. Some may interpret it *exclusively for cultivation and nourishment* [或有专就修养上解者], yet one must *first recognize the Spirit of Grain* [然必须认得谷神方可].\n\n*Xuē Yōngzhāi* [薛庸斋] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is called *the root of Heaven and Earth* [至是谓天地根]. *Grain* [谷] is where *the spirit resides* [神所居]. *Spirit* [神] is what *the form carries* [形所载]. *Nourishing the form to vitalize the qi, containing the qi to harbor the spirit*—this is the *Way of non-perishing* [以形养气，以气含神，不死之道也]. *Spirit inherently does not perish* [神本无死], yet when *assigned to form, it has death* [赋于形而有死], though even in death it *has not truly died* [虽死而未尝死也]. The *Spirit of Grain* [谷神] *does not perish because of the Mysterious Feminine* [因玄牝不死], and *Heaven and Earth take the Mysterious Feminine as their root* [天地以玄牝为根].\n\n*The Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝] is *internal* [内焉], yet *harbors essence externally* [而藏精外焉], *adjusting breath*—*one opening, one closing* [而调息一开一阖], *one exhalation, one inhalation* [一呼一吸]. Exhaling reaches *the deep root* [呼则至於深根], inhaling reaches *the firm base* [吸则至於固蒂]. Thus *the spirit enters* [于是有神入焉], *revolving through the Dipper* [离斗辗历天廷], *riding the sun and moon, parting clouds and mists* [骑日月披云雾], *soaring and returning to the Hall of Great Possession* [腾腾乎会归于大有之室], much like the *divine beings dwelling on Mount Gūshè* [亦犹姑射山有神人居焉].\n\n*Continuous, as if existing* [绵绵若存], *used without exertion* [用之不勤]. *Continuous* [绵绵] means *adjusting breath as if present, as if absent* [调息似有若无], *its use requires no labor* [用之要不至勤劳尔].\n\n*Xiū Xiū’ān* [休休庵] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—*used without exertion* [至用之不勤]. *Void and luminous* [虚明] is called *Grain* [谓之谷], *subtle and wondrous* [灵妙] is called *Spirit* [谓之神]. *Void, luminous, subtle, and wondrous without end* [虚明灵妙无穷] is called *not perishing* [谓之不死], which is the *Mysterious Feminine* [即玄牝也]. *Mysterious* [玄] is the *Great Dao* [大道也]. *Feminine* [牝] is the *Mother* [母也]. *One vital breath* [一气] *generates within the void and luminosity* [生於虚明之中], then *clears and turbid divide to establish Heaven and Earth* [然后分清浊立天地], hence it is said: *The Gate of the Mysterious Feminine is the root of Heaven and Earth* [故云玄牝之门，是谓天地根].\n\n*The wondrous Dao acts without action* [妙道无为], *one vital breath runs unceasingly* [一气运行不绝], hence it is called *continuous, as if existing* [是谓绵绵若存]. *Responding to the times, adapting to circumstances* [应时应机], *benefiting life and aiding all things* [利生济物], *accomplished without labor* [不劳而办], hence it is said: *not exerting* [故云不劝].\n\n*Void, luminous, subtle, and wondrous* [虚明灵妙] in humans is called *heart* [在人曰心]. The *heart is sovereign over all phenomena* [心为万法王], capable of *generating Heaven and Earth, running the sun and moon* [能生育天地，运行日月], *wondrous mechanisms and marvelous functions* [玄机妙用], *effortlessly boundless* [任运无穷], *responding to circumstances and sensations* [随缘应感], *accomplished without labor* [不劳而办]. Those who *awaken and clarify* [悟明者] *understand without being told* [不言而知已].\n\n*Zhù Bóxìu* [褚伯秀] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—*used without exertion* [谷神不死至用之不勤]. *Grain is void yet responsive* [谷虚而善应], *Spirit is luminous yet boundless* [神灵而无方]. If a person *harbors the most luminous essence within the most void place* [人能以至灵之物藏至虚之所], then *they respond to sensations without trace* [则随感而应]. *Response leaves no mark* [应已无迹], *life does not even know its own generation* [生尚不知], *how could death exist* [死乎何有]?\n\n*Mysterious* [玄] refers to *the Dao’s profound, unfathomable nature* [道妙难测], *Feminine* [牝] is *the realm of transformation and nurturing* [化育之地]. Its *function* [其为用也] *is wondrous in generating all things yet eternally generates* [妙万物而能生生], hence it is called *not perishing* [是之谓不死].\n\nThis elucidates *the Way of void-hearted spirit-nourishment* [此发明虚心养神之道], borrowing *Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation* [借天地造化为言], beginning with *void-heartedness and yielding to transformation* [始於虚心而任化], ending with *effortless self-transformation* [终於无心而化自己出]. All things’ generation *originates from this* [凡物之生，本莫不由斯], hence it is called *Gate* [故称门焉].\n\n*Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] says: *The Heavenly Gate* [天门者]—*there is no such thing* [无有也]—*all things emerge from non-being* [二万物出於无有]. In terms of the *Yì* [《易》], this is the *Tàijí* [太极]; in terms of humans, this is *nature* [以人言即性].",

      "original_text": "玄牝之门，是谓天地根。 夫玄牝之说，有内有外。 外则前已释过，内则乃口口相传之机，不记文字。 所以张平叔《悟真篇》有曰：玄牝者，非心非肾、非肝非肺、非脾非三焦、非膀胱非丹田。 然则审何所耶？ 又曰：玄真玄牝，真牝玄牝，都来共一窍。 然此奥理，不遇明师终是难知。 愚尝读《道藏修行论》，有曰玄牝者居二肾之间，号称神室，乃神明所会之府，精气交感之区，人之命门，故称天地根。 盖人身号小天地也。 绵绵若存，用之不动。 此言胎息导引之法，不紧不缓，若存若亡之间，任其鼻息绵绵来往，不待驱而使之。 故云用之不勤也。 《玉帝心印经》 云：上药三品，神与气精。 恍恍惚惚，杳杳冥冥，存无守有，顷刻而成。 回风混合，百日通灵。 出入玄牝，若亡若存。 绵绵不绝，固蒂深根，人各有精，精极成神。 神合有气，气合体真。 神依气生，精依气盈。 其聚则有，其散则零。 三品一理，妙不可听。 一得永得，自然身轻。 太和充溢，骨化寒琼。 此之谓也。 杨智仁曰：谷神不死至用之不勤。 谷神者，天谷元神也。 鸿蒙始判，先有此神。 与太虚同体，与天地同生。 神之来则生，神之去则死。 然生亦未尝生也，死亦未尝死也。 为阴阳之主，为万灵之尊。 渊渊浩浩，日月不得此则不能耀明，五行不得此则不能发生，万物不得此则不能长育。 其不死者，玄牝也。 玄为真阳，牝为真阴。 上通於天，下蟠於地，周流六虚，上下无常。 在丹为真铅汞，在《易》为坎离，在象为龙虎。 人能修之，坎离消长於一身，风云发泄於七窍，真炁熏蒸而无寒暑，纯阳流注而无死生，是谓玄牝之功也。 且门者，乃日月之门户也。 非心肾，非口鼻，非泥丸，非脐下，非脐中一寸二分圆如环者，非夹脊双关，非心上一穴，非闭炁而行之，若执此则谬之甚矣。 何不返观天地之根乎？ 《易》 曰寂然不动者诚也，感而遂通者神也，玄牝之门也。 动而未形之间者，几也，天地之根也。 诚精故明，神应故妙，几微故幽，诚几曰圣。 绵绵若存，用之不勤。 喻清中曰：谷神不死至用之不勤。 老氏一书，治国爱民，修心养性，服气炼神，精粗毕举，本末兼该。 此章大槩主於修养，当合儒道之书而互相发明之。 自儒家之说言之，谷者，虚也； 神者，虚中之神也。 自道家之说言之，谷，天谷也； 神者，一身之元神也。 元神所住之宫，其空如谷而神居之，故谓之谷神，泥丸宫是也。 神存则生，神去则死，谷神之所以不死者，由玄牝也。 阳神为玄，阴息为牝，神气交感，自然成真。 与道为一，而入於不死不生，故曰谷神不死，是谓玄牝。 《黄帝阴符经》曰：口通五脏，出者重浊之气属阴，谓之地根。 鼻通六腑，出者轻清之气属阳，谓之天根。 口鼻二者，阳神阴息，往来之门，故曰玄牝之门，是谓天地根。 圣人运用此气於升降之顷，存炼此气於呼吸之间，绵绵续续，勿令间断，存者顺其自然而存之，神久自宁，息久自定。 未尝至於勤劳迫促。 故曰用之不勤。 儒道之书，共归一揆，列子全引此章，指为黄帝曰，则老氏之言似有所自。 或人谓人身中自有一窍，非口鼻也，非心肾也，非谷道也，其要未易言，俟与谈玄者商之。 胥六虚曰：谷神不死，是谓玄牝。",
      "translated_text": "The **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—this is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nNow, the discourse on the Mysterious Female has **inner and outer** aspects. The **outer** has already been explained above; the **inner** is a **mouth-to-mouth transmitted** secret, not recorded in texts. Thus, Zhang Pingzhong’s *Awakening to the True* [《悟真篇》] states:\n\n*The Mysterious Female*—\nnot the heart, not the kidneys,\nnot the liver, not the lungs,\nnot the spleen, not the Triple Burner,\nnot the bladder, not the elixir field [丹田].\n\nThen what is it?\nIt is further said:\n*The True Mysterious Female, the Mysterious True Female*—\nall converge at a single orifice.\n\nYet this profound principle,\nwithout an enlightened teacher, is difficult to know.\n\nI once read the *Daoist Canon on Cultivation* [《道藏修行论》], which states:\n*The Mysterious Female resides between the two kidneys,*\ncalled the **Divine Chamber**—\nthe **Palace where the Spirit-Sovereigns assemble**,\nthe **Region where essence and qi intermingle**,\nthe **Gate of Life**—\nthus called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nFor the human body is a **miniature Heaven and Earth**.\n\nContinuous as if preserved yet never ceasing—\nthis speaks of the **Fetal Breath cultivation method**:\nneither strained nor slack,\nas if present yet as if absent,\nletting the nasal breath flow gently in and out,\nwithout forcing it.\nThus it is said: *its use requires no effort* [用之不勤].\n\nThe *Jade Emperor’s Heart-Seal Scripture* [《玉帝心印经》] states:\n*The three supreme elixirs*—\n**Spirit, Qi, and Essence**.\nVague and indistinct,\ndim and obscure,\npreserved yet not held,\ninstantly perfected.\n\nThe **cyclic winds merge**—\nin a hundred days, the **Spirit becomes luminous**.\nEntering and exiting the **Mysterious Female**,\nas if absent yet as if present,\nendlessly unbroken,\nfirmly rooted—\neach person has their **essence**,\nand when essence is perfected, **spirit is born**.\n\nWhen spirit unites with **qi**, and **qi unites with the body’s true nature**,\nspirit depends on qi to manifest,\nessence depends on qi to flourish.\nWhen gathered, it exists;\nwhen scattered, it dissipates.\n\nThe three elixirs share one principle—\nwondrous beyond words.\nObtain it once, and it is eternal—\nnaturally, the body becomes light.\nThe **Great Harmony** overflows,\nbones transmute into **frosted jade**.\n\nThis is the meaning.\n\nYang Zhiren says:\n*From \"Valley-Spirit does not perish\" to \"its use requires no effort.\"*\nThe **Valley-Spirit**—\nthis is the **Heavenly Primordial Spirit** [天谷元神].\nAt the **Hun-Dong’s** [鸿蒙] initial division,\nthis spirit existed first.\nIt shares substance with the **Great Void**,\nand is born with Heaven and Earth.\nWhen the spirit arrives, life begins;\nwhen the spirit departs, death comes.\nYet life is never truly born,\nand death is never truly death.\n\nIt is the **Sovereign of Yin and Yang**,\nthe **Exalted Lord of all Spirits**.\nProfound and vast—\nwithout it, the sun and moon cannot shine,\nwithout it, the Five Phases cannot flourish,\nwithout it, all things cannot grow.\nIts immortality lies in the **Mysterious Female**.\n\n*Mysterious* is **True Yang**,\n*Female* is **True Yin**.\nAbove, it connects to Heaven;\nbelow, it coils within Earth,\ncirculating through the **Six Voids**,\nwithout fixed abode above or below.\n\nIn the elixir, it is **True Lead and Mercury** [真铅汞];\nin the *I Ching*, it is **Kan and Li** [坎离];\nin the symbols, it is **Dragon and Tiger**.\nWhen a person cultivates it,\nKan and Li wax and wane within the body,\nwinds and clouds surge through the **Seven Orifices**,\ntrue *qi* steams and warms without cold or heat,\npure Yang flows and nourishes without birth or death—\nthis is the **function of the Mysterious Female**.\n\nMoreover, the **Gate**—\nthis is the **portal of the sun and moon**.\nNot the heart or kidneys,\nnot the mouth or nose,\nnot the **Cinnabar Field** [泥丸],\nnot the **elixir field below the navel**,\nnot the **one-inch circular orifice within the navel**,\nnot the **double gate between the shoulder blades**,\nnot the **orifice above the heart**,\nnor is it a matter of **closing the breath and forcing it**—\nto fixate on these is utterly mistaken.\nWhy not return to the **Root of Heaven and Earth**?\n\nThe *I Ching* says:\n*The still and unmoving is sincerity* [诚],\n*responding and thus communicating is spirit*—\nthis is the **Gate of the Mysterious Female**.\n*The movement before form takes shape is the subtle*—\nthis is the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nSincerity is refined, thus clear;\nspirit responds, thus wondrous;\nthe subtle is profound, thus mysterious.\nSincerity and subtlety—this is **sagacity**.\n\nContinuous as if preserved yet never ceasing—\nits use requires no effort.\n\nJù Qīngzhōng says:\n*From \"Valley-Spirit does not perish\" to \"its use requires no effort.\"*\n\nThe *Book of Laozi* treats **governance and benevolence**,\n**cultivating the heart and nurturing nature**,\n**breath-work and spirit-refining**—\nboth coarse and subtle, beginning and end,\nall encompassed.\nThis chapter primarily concerns **cultivation and nourishment**,\nand should be harmonized with **Confucian and Daoist texts** for mutual elucidation.\n\nFrom the **Confucian perspective**:\n*Valley* means **emptiness**;\n*Spirit* means **the spirit within emptiness**.\n\nFrom the **Daoist perspective**:\n*Valley* is the **Heavenly Valley**;\n*Spirit* is the **Primordial Spirit of the body**.\nThe **Palace where the Primordial Spirit resides**—\nits emptiness is like a valley, yet the spirit dwells within—\nthus it is called **Valley-Spirit**, the **Cinnabar Field Palace** [泥丸宫].\nWhen the spirit is preserved, life continues;\nwhen the spirit departs, death comes.\nThe reason the **Valley-Spirit does not perish**\nlies in the **Mysterious Female**.\n\nThe **Yang Spirit** is *Mysterious*,\nthe **Yin Breath** is *Female*—\nwhen spirit and breath intermingle,\ntrue essence naturally forms.\nUniting with the **Way**, it enters **neither death nor birth**—\nthus: *Valley-Spirit does not perish*—\nthis is the **Mysterious Female**.\n\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Secret of Yin* [《黄帝阴符经》] states:\n*The mouth connects to the five viscera*—\nthe exhaled breath is **heavy and turbid**, belonging to **Yin**—\ncalled the **Earthly Root**.\n*The nose connects to the six bowels*—\nthe exhaled breath is **light and pure**, belonging to **Yang**—\ncalled the **Heavenly Root**.\nThe mouth and nose—\nthe **Yang Spirit and Yin Breath**—\nare the **passageways of their coming and going**,\nthus called the **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—\nthis is the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nThe Sage **directs this breath** during **ascent and descent**,\n**preserves and refines it** within **inhalation and exhalation**,\ncontinuously, without interruption.\nPreserve it by following its natural course—\nover time, the spirit naturally settles,\nthe breath naturally steadies.\nIt is never forced or hastened.\nThus it is said: *its use requires no effort*.\n\nThe **Confucian and Daoist texts** converge in principle.\nLiezi fully cites this chapter, attributing it to the Yellow Emperor,\nsuggesting Laozi’s words may have had an origin.\n\nSome say the human body contains **one orifice**—\nnot the mouth or nose,\nnot the heart or kidneys,\nnot the **Valley Passage** [谷道]—\nyet its essence is difficult to articulate.\nLet those who discuss the **Mysterious** deliberate further.\n\nXū Liùxū says:\n*Valley-Spirit does not

      "translated_text": "The cultivation of *qi* is but another extension by humans of their own reasoning.\n\nWu Huanzhong said: *\"The Valley-Spirit does not die—its use requires no effort.\"*\n\nWu Huanzhong’s disciple, Wu Zhen, remarked: *\"The *Laozi* contains hidden Daoist intent—when the spirit is ever-nourished, the *po* does not dissipate, and water and fire harmonize. His words are most unusual.\"*\n\nI once heard my teacher say: *\"The Valley-Spirit is the primordial *qi* of Heaven-before-Heaven. Spirit-*qi* returns to the Mysterious Feminine, and wherever the mind moves, it borrows spirit to act—not through mouth or nose. Mysterious, it is Yang; Feminine, it is Yin—true Yin, true Yang.\"*\n\nAs *Zhuangzi* says: *\"All things are born, yet none know their root; they emerge, yet none know their gate. But the source from which Heaven and Earth arise is the Mysterious Feminine.\"*\n\nThe essence of the Great Elixir lies not beyond the spirit, soul, *po*, and intent. Spirit is fire; essence is water—true unity’s essence. The soul is wood; the *po* is metal; intent is earth. The Five Phases cannot be pure without earth, and intent nourishes *qi*. Nourishing *qi* condenses essence; condensing essence awakens spirit. When the Four Symbols harmonize into one, refined practice makes *qi* soft and enduring—unbroken, like thread. Its use requires no effort; day and night, it flows naturally.\n\nAncient immortals, whether hidden or revealed, spoke of *yin-yang* as substance, likened it to lead and mercury, compared it to sun and moon, modeled it on male and female, likened it to dragon and tiger—*Zhen* and *Dui*, *Kan* and *Li*, gold and cinnabar, *Jia* and *Geng*, *Bing* and *Ren*, *Wu* and *Ji*, water and fire, sovereign and minister, child and mother, infant and maiden, knife and scale, metal and wood, warmth and cold, host and guest, floating and sinking, bathing and rinsing, birth and death, punishment and virtue, battle and retreat, waxing and waning, addition and subtraction, *wen* and *wu*, hot and cold—all these are matters of the Mysterious Feminine. Thus, they established symbols in metaphor, urging one to self-realization: seek it within, not without. Have you not heard the saying: *\"The Master of Emptiness and Stillness governs spirit, spirit retains *qi*—no need for external arts to attain longevity?\"*\n\nToday’s seekers of the Dao may recognize medicinal herbs but lack the means to apply them. Even if they know where to begin, they fail to grasp the method, wandering lost in the Mysterious Feminine’s domain. Spirit is the root of life; form is the vessel of spirit. When spirit is whole, *qi* is whole; when *qi* is whole, essence is whole; when essence is whole, form is whole; when form is whole, spirit thrives; when spirit thrives, *qi* is refined; when *qi* is refined, spirit transcends. At first, it aligns with the Dao as one. But when spirit is diminished, essence cannot recover; when essence is depleted, the *po* is restless.\n\nYou study texts—do you not understand the interplay of things? Yet in waking and sleeping, in seeing, hearing, speaking, and moving, your mind wanders beyond the reach of ears, eyes, heart, and thought. This is what ancient immortals, having cast aside desires and transcended the mundane, achieved only through unyielding resolve. If spirit cannot govern *qi*, and *qi* cannot solidify form, how can one dwell in peace, much less preserve their dwelling? To seek enduring attainment is difficult indeed.\n\nYou heard my words, and with a smile of sudden understanding, said nothing.\n\nThe teacher then poured wine and sang a chapter from *The Songs of Chu*:\n\n*\"The Dao can be received but not transmitted,\nIts smallness has no bounds within,\nIts greatness knows no limits without.\nWithout deceit, the spirit is pure—\nThen it follows its natural course.\nHow could it be that *qi* is so refined,\nThat at midnight, in emptiness, it waits—\nBefore action, in non-doing’s embrace?\"*\n\nWith a bow, he departed. On a leisurely day, I composed three stanzas to caution myself:\n\n*\"Not all demons are heavy burdens,\nComing forward to speak of foolish dreams.\nXie the Immortal lights the fire with shared intent,\nYangzi’s riverbank watches one *liang* of gold.\nWhen alone, the work is just right—\nConcealed, concealed, concealed, yet not difficult.\nThere are hundreds of green-copper vessels,\nOften poured with kind words to quench my thirst.\nRain or no rain, wind or no wind,\nWithout doubt, without worry, laughter rings warm.\nClustered joy on cinnabar’s earth,\nSealed alone, opened alone.\"*\n\nAnd another poem:\n\n*\"Do not delay in beginning—\nWhat doubt remains of the Golden Elixir?\nA single ball of harmonized *qi*—\nMind the fire’s precision.\nWhen the Four Symbols unite,\nDivine insight naturally appears.\nTo grasp its true mystery,\nObserve the lone moon over the pool.\"*\n\n*—Moon House carving on Stone Pool’s annotation of the* Dao De Jing*, appended by Zhen to this chapter on the Valley-Spirit. Master Wu Zhen’s poem reads:*\n\n*\"Do not blame Heaven’s secrets for leaking—\nIt is because seekers are too bewildered.\nHahaha.\"*\n\nMaster Benyuan said: *\"The Valley-Spirit does not die—its use requires no effort. The Valley is empty yet formed; the spirit within it is formless yet present. Mysterious, it is deep yet intangible; as the Feminine, it is void yet substantial. Formless yet present—thus it does not die; void yet substantial—thus it can generate. This too is the body of the Dao.*\n\n*Its emergence is called the Gate; its sustaining root is called the Root. The first chapter speaks of Heaven, Earth, and all things. But here, it does not mention all things—for where there are Heaven and Earth, there are all things. The Root is that which endlessly generates, and thus all things are within it. If one embodies the Dao in the body, unbroken as thread, then the Valley-Spirit and the Mysterious Feminine will reside within you, and the Dao’s use will know no end.*\n\n*Unbroken—neither void nor not-void.\nAs-if-preserved—neither present nor not-present.\nWithout effort—without toil.\nIf one says it is taken from left or right,\nIt is but returning to its origin.\nThe *Laozi*’s intent is, broadly, to trace the Dao’s mystery back to Heaven—Heaven and Earth’s beginning—and then reflect it within the self, embodying and preserving it. Mencius’ *xiao-hua cun-shen* is akin to the Valley-Spirit. The Buddhist *zhēnkōng miǎoyǒu* aligns with the Mysterious Feminine.\"*",

      "translated_text": "---\n\n**Chapter on Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久章)**\n\n*Considerations of Differences (考异):*\nThe River Upper Master (河上公) composed *The Chapter of Concealing Brilliance (韬光章)*, while Zhao Shizhan (赵实庵) titled it *The Chapter on Eternal Generation Without Generation (生生不生义章)*.\n\nEmperor Ming of Tang (唐明皇) commented:\nIn the previous chapter, the **Daoist Mystery of the Eternal Valley Spirit (谷神不死)** was illuminated through its hollow response—this hollow response is the very **unexhausted source**. This chapter elucidates the **impartiality of Heaven and Earth**, for their impartiality is why they endure eternally. It begins by setting forth Heaven and Earth as an analogy, then proceeds to cite the Sage (圣人) to further clarify, concluding with the principle that impartiality fulfills private ends, urging diligence in this practice.\n\nDu Guangting (杜光庭) remarked:\nThe previous chapter expounded upon the **Daoist Mystery of the Eternal Valley Spirit**, illustrating how Heaven and Earth **nurture qi** through natural spontaneity. This chapter emphasizes **Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久)**, aligning with the **practice of natural spontaneity**. The Sage, too, by **applying the Way with impartiality**, ensures that all things converge—thus attaining **harmony and national tranquility**. Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **do not selfishly assert their own generation**; the Sage **abandons his own self** while his self persists, and **sets aside his own self** while his self remains. Is this not because of their **impartiality**? Thus, they fulfill their **private ends**.\n\n*Considerations of Differences (考异):*\nThe River Upper Master (河上公) and Yan Junping (严君平) originally read, *\"Is this not because of their **impartiality**?\"* (非以其无私邪), but Wang Bi’s (王弼) ancient version read, *\"Is this not because of their **lack of impartiality**?\"* (不以其无私邪). The Kaiyuan Imperial Edition (开元御本) restored it to *\"Is this not because of their **impartiality**?\"* (非以其无私邪).\n\nThe River Upper Master (河上公) said:\n**Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久)**—this expounds upon the **longevity of Heaven and Earth**, serving as a metaphor for instruction. Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **do not selfishly assert their own generation**. Their singular capacity to endure long is because they **remain tranquil**, act without expectation of reward, and do not **reside like mortals**, nor **covet private benefits** by seizing others’ blessings. Thus, they attain **eternal longevity**. Since they **do not seek their own generation**, they can **endure without ceasing**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **abandons his own self**—this is the practice of **prioritizing others before oneself**. Yet his self **persists first**—for the world reveres him foremost, deeming him eternal. He **sets aside his own self**—this is the practice of **neglecting oneself for others**. Yet his self **remains preserved**—for the people love him as a parent, and the spirits nurture him like an infant, so his self **endures perpetually**. Is this not because of their **impartiality**? Thus, they fulfill their **private ends**. What others consider **private** is the **desire to enrich oneself**. The Sage, being impartial, yet **enriches himself**, thus fulfilling his **private ends**.\n\nWang Fu’s (王辅嗣) commentary:\n**Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久) because they do not selfishly assert their own generation**—to selfishly assert one’s own generation is to **contend with all things**; not to do so is for all things to **converge naturally**. Thus, they endure eternally and fulfill their **private ends**. **Impartiality** is to **act without selfish regard for oneself**; when one’s self **persists first** and **remains preserved**, it is said that one fulfills their **private ends**.\n\nEmperor Ming of Tang (唐明皇) said:\n**Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久)**—by setting forth Heaven and Earth’s eternal endurance, it is made clear that **impartiality and lack of desire** lead to **eternal longevity**. The conclusion of the metaphor and its meaning lie in the Sage’s **abandoning and setting aside his own self**, wherein **impartiality fulfills private ends**.\n\nCommentary (疏):\nThis chapter begins with a **posed question**. Heaven is called **long** because of its **vital qi (气象)**, and Earth is called **durable** because of its **substance and form (形质)**. Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **do not selfishly assert their own generation**. Their **virtue and power** in nurturing all things are vast, yet they endure long because they **draw from the Dao’s foundation**, not **boasting of their own generative function**.\n\nCommentary (疏):\nThe opening sentence poses a question; the following is a hypothetical response: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **cover and nourish all things**, fostering the myriad materials, all of which **draw from the Dao’s foundation**. They do not **boast of their own generative function**, thus their longevity enables them to **generate all things**.\"* Another interpretation states: *\"Not selfishly asserting their own generation\"* means that Heaven and Earth **only generate and nourish all things**, without **privately enriching their own existence**. Thus, they attain **eternal longevity**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **endures while his self persists**—**abandoning his own self** leads others to **delight in promoting him**, so his self **persists first**. **Setting aside his own self** results in **tranquil forgetfulness**, so his self **remains preserved**. Commentary (疏):\nThus, the Sage **imitates Heaven and Earth**, ensuring **equitable coverage** and **nurturing without selfishness**, so he **prioritizes others first**. The people **rejoice and rely upon him**; he is revered by those below, so his self **persists first**.

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the question is posed and answered by oneself to reveal its meaning. Having already asked in the previous verse—*\"Why does Heaven endure and Earth last so long?\"*—this one responds: *\"Because Heaven and Earth utilize the **Dao/Way's** primordial harmony (运元和) and the **cosmic surge** (冲用) of **qi**, nurturing all existences (群品). Though all existences thrive, Heaven and Earth do not claim their **virtue/power** (德) nor possess their **achievement** (功), and thus they endure eternally.*\n\n*If they claimed their achievement, their **virtue/power** would dwindle; if they possessed their **virtue/power**, it would grow shallow. By not claiming, their **virtue/power** is vast and their **achievement** grand—all things return to their source, and thus Heaven and Earth endure.*\n\n*The sovereign who governs his realm should follow the Dao/Way of Heaven, acting without contrivance (无为), letting all flourish in ease (熙熙). When the people naturally attain peace (平泰), then the nation’s blessings will stretch far, and his own lifespan will extend long—just as Heaven and Earth endure through their lack of selfishness.*\n\n*The sage who cultivates himself avoids laborious schemes and vain pursuits of name, nor does he exhaust his **qi** with ambitious deeds or indulgent desires. His spirit remains tranquil within, his **qi** harmonious within, and thus his nation’s fortune endures, his body thrives—just as Heaven and Earth, without selfishness, endure eternally.*\n\n*Therefore, the sage arrives while his body still lives. In governing the realm, he does not arrogantly seek noble status through action nor burden the people for his own gain—this is what is called **posterity’s body** (后身) and **external body** (外身).*\n\n*The sovereigns of the **Age of Great Clarity** (太古) encompassed the will of Heaven and Earth, their benevolence extending to all under Heaven, yet they were unknown by name. In life, they held no rank, no station; in death, no posthumous title, no record of their deeds. Their substance did not gather, their fame did not stand—yet all under Heaven willingly honored them, and all things joyfully revered them. Truly, they embodied **posterity’s body while their own body led** (后身而身先), **external body while their own body endured** (外身而身存)!*\n\n*But in the world’s decline, such sovereigns no longer exist. Instead, they indulge their own desires, enslaving the people, and drain their strength to serve themselves. The people grow weary, governance falters, and all under Heaven abandons them. This is what is called **losing the way of external and posterity’s body** (失外身后身之道).*\n\n*How much better to discard the **broken jade pillow** (碎琥珀之枕), abandon the **fine furs of the wild goose** (焚雉头之裘), cease the extravagance of a **single grand hall** (罢一台之费), and reject the **thousand-mile horses** (却千里之马)—thus, his **virtue/power** shines through the age, his name gleams on bamboo and silk. The scholar who refines himself does not covet honor or rank—this is **externalizing his body**; he does not rush for advancement—this is **postponing his body**. Thus, his body endures while his **virtue/power** is full; when his **virtue/power** is full, all submit. This is truly **body leading while body endures** (身先身存).*\n\n*To invert this is to stray far from the Dao/Way. Is it not because they lack selfishness that they achieve such greatness?*\n\n*The sage’s cultivation of himself is thus: he aligns with Nature’s transformations, neither monopolizing singular insights nor hoarding his life’s blessings. He does not arrogate his own virtue, nor does he claim precedence over all under Heaven—yet he stands above all, enjoys long fortune, and all people find solace in their hearts, while the uncivilized bow in reverence. Weapons fall silent, ancestral temples stand secure. This is the greatness of his lack of selfishness!*\n\n*For it is because he does not cling to selfishness as selfishness that he attains such brilliance. In cultivating himself, his **virtue/power** is full and all submit; his **Dao/Way** resonates with the divine, his body thrives eternally—this is the greatness of his lack of selfishness! It is also because he does not yield to selfish cravings that he achieves this vast lack of selfishness.*\n\n*The **Scripture of the Spirit Jewel** (灵宝经) says: *\"Those who dwell in the world, chasing pleasures and indulging desires, find joy now and suffering later. Why so? Because they reach the extreme of ease and fall into the three abysses (三涂).\"* The scholar of the Dao/Way cuts ties with worldly gains, forgets fame, endures cold lodgings, and refines his conduct—ultimately attaining the **Dao/Way of transcendence** (仙道). First suffering, then joy—why? Because he accumulates his deeds and ascends to the **Nine Heavens** (九天).*\n\n*The **Venerable Sovereign of the Dao/Way** (宋道君) said: *\"Heaven endures and Earth lasts long because they do so eternally. Heaven’s vault is vast and its station above, with the **celestial axis** (经) as the sun and moon, and the **celestial loom** (纬) as the stars and constellations, sheltering all things beneath. Earth’s foundation is firm and its station below, forming mountains and valleys, blending into rivers and marshes, bearing all things upon it. All things are sheltered and carried by Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth have no concern for them—thus, Heaven moves ceaselessly yet remains steadfast, Earth stands firm yet endures without change, and so they last long and endure.*\n\n*If Heaven and Earth had concern for all things, then Heaven would soon be measured, its sheltering shallow; Earth would soon be fathomed, its bearing thin. If so, they would rely on others—how could they then endure eternally?\"*\n\n*Therefore, the sage arrives while his body still lives. Heaven moves above, Earth rests below; the sage stands between them, embodying the **Three Powers** (三才) in harmony, distinguishing the **Three Poles** (三极) in their essence, and uniting the **Three Spirits** (三灵) in their **primordial marvel** (元妙之神). Yet Heaven, Earth, and the sage all attain the Dao/Way. And the sage’s method of governing himself is also that of Heaven and Earth. Hence, this chapter first speaks of Heaven and Earth not asserting their own generation, and then follows with the sage not possessing his own body.*\n\n*All take precedence for themselves, yet the sage alone takes what comes later—saying, *\"I bear all under Heaven’s filth\"* (受天下之垢), which is called **postponing his body**, meaning he does not contend with others, and thus none can contend with him. Hence it is said: *\"Postponing his body, yet his body leads.\"* He does not vie for perilous advantages nor struggle for ease in winter and summer, nor does he compete for the balance of **yin and yang**. He transcends life and death, abandons fortune and misfortune, and his spirit is never constrained.*\n\n*This is called **externalizing his body while his body endures**. If the sage’s method of governing himself is thus, how much more so for external matters? He encounters them without clinging, passes them without retaining, his nature embracing the spirit, wandering between ancient customs and the present. The people will self-correct, distinctions between self and other dissolve, and he is born before Heaven and Earth yet does not age, enduring beyond the **Age of Great Clarity** (上古) without growing old. This is his effect! Is it not because he lacks selfishness?\"*",

      "translated_text": "The sage thus achieves his own ends.\n\nThe great **virtue/power** (德) of Heaven and Earth is called **generation** (生), and the great treasure of the sage is called **position** (位). The **Dao/Way** (道) is the public principle by which these are realized. Heaven and Earth embody the **Dao/Way**, hence they lack selfishness; lacking selfishness, they endure long. The sage embodies the **Dao/Way**, hence he lacks selfishness; lacking selfishness, he remains everlasting. To **self-cultivate for private gain** (自营) is selfishness, and none have ever succeeded in their selfishness. Wang Anshi said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate** (长生). \"Long\" refers to their vastness, \"durable\" to their constancy. Since they do not **self-generate**, they can **long-generate**.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure because they do not **self-generate** but allow all things to generate as they will. Having allowed all things to generate, they can then **long-generate** all things without bearing the burden of **generation** (生). Again, he said: When speaking of Heaven, one says \"long\"; when speaking of Earth, one says \"durable,\" so it is clear that \"durable\" is the heavier term. Therefore, the sage arrives yet his body precedes. The sage has no **self** (我), for if he had a self, he would contend with things, and things would draw him into contention. All things oppose the **self** (我). If I do not oppose them, I follow them. **Externalizing his body while his body endures** (外其身而身存). All things burden the **self** (我), but if I do not burden myself with them, I externalize them. Therefore, it is said: **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends?\n\nThe *Zi Shuo* (《字说》) says: \"Self-cultivation for private gain\" (自营) is selfishness, and turning one's back on the public is selfishness. Those who **self-cultivate for private gain** (自营) have never succeeded in their selfishness. Therefore, the character for \"selfishness\" (私) is composed of \"self-cultivation\" (自营) and does not include the shape of \"harm.\" Hence, Laozi said: It is not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends. The character \"private\" (私) is formed from \"禾\" (*hé*, grain) and \"ㄙ\" (*sī*, self-cultivation). Self-cultivation cannot avoid being selfish, but if selfishness does not harm the utility of things, then there is no grievance toward selfishness.\n\nSu Yingbin said: Heaven and Earth endure. Though vast, their endurance is not separate from form and number, so their long-lasting nature is limited. Yet Laozi’s words on endurance extend to Heaven and Earth. This is merely from the perspective of what humans perceive. As for the ultimate endurance, it is what is called the **beginning of Heaven and Earth** (天地始). Heaven and Earth thus achieve their own ends through **long-endurance**. Heaven and Earth generate all things yet do not **self-generate**; they stand outside all things, hence they can **long-generate**. The sage follows his own body yet precedes others; **externalizes his body while his body endures**, benefiting others. He stands apart from the crowd, hence he can both precede and endure.\n\nIf Heaven and Earth were to contend with things for **generation**, and if the sage were to compete with others for **virtue/power**, then Heaven and Earth would merely be one thing among many, and the sage merely one person among others. How could this be considered a great transgression? Though they lack selfishness, it is not to seek their own ends that they succeed in achieving them—this is simply the **Dao/Way** as it is. Lü Jiufu said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**. \"Long\" and \"short\" refer to form, \"durable\" and \"near\" to time. Heaven acts according to time, yet since time is insufficient to describe its form, one speaks of it as \"long.\" Earth acts according to form, yet since form is insufficient to describe its duration, one speaks of it as \"durable.\"\n\nThe root of Heaven and Earth lies in the **Dark Mother** (玄牝), and the essence of the **Dark Mother** is established in the **Valley Spirit** (谷神), which is **not-death** (不死). **Not-death** means **not-generation**, and those who do not generate can generate **generation**. This is why Heaven and Earth can endure both long and durable—because they do not **self-generate**, and not **self-generating**, they can **long-generate**. It is as if they were the **Valley Spirit** itself. Therefore, the sage arrives yet his body precedes. The sage does not consider his body as a burden, though it is unavoidable, and nothing can surpass it. **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. He stands in the **non-existence of existence** (无何有), and no thing can harm him, hence it is said: **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends?\n\nThe body is my own selfishness. To **follow his own body** (后其身) and **externalize his body** (外其身) is to act publicly and without selfishness. Without selfishness, he can achieve his own ends. Lü Nongshi said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**. Those who cling to life do not generate, and those who abandon life do not die. Hence it is said: Heaven and Earth endure. Heaven and Earth endure because they do not **self-generate**, hence they can **long-generate**. Therefore, the sage arrives yet his body endures. The sage is the **harmonious union of Heaven and Earth** (天地之合), and his only task is to **bend himself** (屈己). By this, he first forgets the **self** (我), and thus the **self** (我) is preserved. Hence it is said: The sage arrives yet his body endures. Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends?\n\nIt is not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends. Yet bending himself is easy to forget. Wang Yuanzhe said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**. If one **self-generates**, then one has one’s own **generation**, and having one’s own **generation** means that **generation** is already lost. Only he who does not take **generation** as his standard has never **generated**. **Generation** never **generated**, so though his form may **generate**, it does not bear the burden of **generation**, and thus it is fitting that he endure both long and durable. Heaven and Earth’s not **self-generating** is not for the sake of enduring long and durable—this is simply the **Dao/Way** as it is. What is called \"long-durable\" is also but a fleeting moment. Only what **covers and sustains** (盖载) without ever failing is its true nature.\n\nTherefore, the sage **follows his own body** yet his body precedes. Though the sage is sage, his form is equal to that of things; only by embodying the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and not contending does he alone differ from the crowd. If he were to establish himself and oppose the crowd, even an ordinary person would be sufficient to overcome him. **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. If he has a **self** (我) and preserves it, then all things become his enemies. Only he who transcends and **self-destroys** (自丧), who does not possess a **self**, can none of the things overturn him. It is not because he lacks selfishness that he achieves his own ends. The sage lacks selfishness because he has never possessed a **self**. If he were to scheme and act thus, then how much more selfish would he be?\n\nLiu Jujie said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**.",

      "translated_text": "「Heaven and Earth endure through their **harmonizing** (燮) and **unity** (和). When things **generate one another** (物物我生), they must inevitably **decay** (衰) and **be consumed** (敝). Only when one does not **self-generate** (不我其生) to fulfill the **principle** (理) of creation does **long-generation** (长生) become possible.\n\nHeaven **accumulates qi** (气), and its fortune lies in **dispersion** (远), hence its association with **length** (长). Earth **accumulates mass** (块), and its fortune lies in **solidity** (固), hence its association with **duration** (久). They do not say **\"long-generation\"** (久生) because of their **length and duration** (长久).\n\nThough Heaven and Earth **accumulate qi** and **mass**, their **principle** (理) remains unbroken while their **substance** (有) endures—how can one know that Heaven and Earth will ever **be consumed** (坏)? Thus, those who claim **length and duration** (长久) are **deluded** (妄者), for they only **observe substance** (有).\n\nHence, the sage **embodies** (至) the Dao while his body **endures**. When the sage **aligns with** Heaven and Earth, he **sacrifices his body** (后身), and his body, like theirs, does not **self-generate** (自生). For his body to **generate** (生) and **endure** (存) is akin to **long-generation** (长生). **\"Sacrificing his body\"** (后身) means **yielding to others** (屈己), and **\"externalizing his body\"** (外身) means **abandoning the self** (忘我). To **yield to others** (屈己) is to be **subdued by others** (人下之), hence he **takes precedence** (先). To **abandon the self** (忘我) is to **externalize his body** (外其身) while it **endures** (存).\n\nIs it not because he **lacks selfishness** (无私) that he achieves his own ends? **Long-generation** (长生) is not **self-generation** (自生), and **endurance** (存) is not **possession** (有). The sage **sacrifices his body** (后其身) yet does not **take precedence** (先), **externalizes his body** (外其身) yet does not **possess** (有). He **wanders beyond** the dust and filth, **unbound in the realm of non-action** (无为之业), **discarding his frame** (隳支体), **abandoning keen senses** (黜聪明), **separating from form and intelligence** (离形去智), **uniting with the Great Thoroughfare** (大通), and **aligning with the Dao in duration** (与道同久). Thus, his body does not **await precedence** (期先) yet **precedes**, does not **await endurance** (期存) yet **endures**.\n\nIs it not because he **lacks selfishness** (无私) that he achieves his own ends? The sage’s **sacrificing his body** (后其身) and **externalizing his body** (外其身) are **expressed outwardly** (为表) in **gentleness, weakness, and humility** (濡弱谦下), yet **substantiated inwardly** (为实) in **emptiness and non-destruction** (虚空不毁) of all things. Thus, the next section speaks of **\"the highest goodness is like water\"** (上善若水).\n\nZhao Shizhang said: The opening presents three causes:\n1. **Illustrating the principle of Heaven and Earth’s long-generation**. Heaven is **long**, Earth is **durable**. The Dao **manifests through symbols** (因象显) yet its end is unknown; fire **transmits through fuel** (以薪传) yet its exhaustion is unseen. When things **generate with form** (有象), the Dao **accompanies them**. That which **generates and continually generates** (生而生生) has never truly **generated**; fire **transmits yet becomes illumination** (传而为明), fuel **transforms while fire remains hidden** (薪化而火隐), and the **radiant** (昭昭) has never been **obscured** (昧). Thus, the previous section demonstrates **the Spirit of the Valley does not die** (谷神不死), which is called the **Mysterious Female** (玄牝). The **Gate of the Mysterious Female** (玄牝之门) is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth** (天地根). The **principle of its non-dying governance** (政不死之理) lies in **non-exertion** (不勤).\n\nContinuing with **Heaven and Earth’s long duration**, it takes their **manifestation** (征) as evidence.\n\n2. **Clarifying that self-generation originates from the absence of a fixed heart**. Heaven and Earth’s ability to be **long and durable** (能长且久) comes from the **original qi** (一炁) being **divided into the two polarities** (两仪), and though their **positions** (奠位) differ in **high and low**, they **share the essence of obtaining the One** (同乎得一之灵). Heaven, by **obtaining the One** (得一), is **naturally long** (固自长). Earth, by **obtaining the One** (得一), is **naturally durable** (固自久). **Long** (长) and **durable** (久) share the same **principle** (义) of **unity with the One** (同一体).\n\nWhy does Heaven speak of **long** (长), and Earth speak of **durable** (久)? Heaven is described through **qi** (气), hence **long**; Earth is described through **form** (形), hence **durable**. **Clear qi** (清气) ascends, and above it **form emerges** (上有形) while **uniting with the formless** (同乎无形). The **vast and boundless** (苍苍) is its **true color** (正色). **Turbulent qi** (浊气) descends, and below it **substance emerges** (下有气) yet cannot **escape form** (形). The **vastness** (广大) is its **self-sustaining nature** (自任).\n\nYet Heaven and Earth are **generated by the Dao** (道之所生). The **Great Dao** (大道) is **formless**, and it **nurtures** Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth regard the **formless** (无形) as their **parents** (父母). The **formless** (无形) is **nameless** (无名), and the **nameless** (无名) is the **beginning of Heaven and Earth** (天地之始). To **trace the origin of Heaven and Earth** (原天地之本) is to **receive emptiness in essence** (以虚受性), and to **transform essence into emptiness** (以性化虚)—this is **entering from substance into non-substance** (从有入无). To **transform emptiness into qi** (以虚化气), and to **generate form through qi** (以气生形), is **entering from non-substance into substance** (从无入有).\n\nThe **obtaining the One** (得一) refers to the **True Primordial Essence** (真元). The **True Primordial Essence** (真元) is the **Original Qi** (一气). Because the **two qi** (二气) **intermingle harmoniously** (交合) and do not **deviate from constancy** (失於常), they can **generate without end** (生生而不穷). If one were to regard their **intermingling and transformation** (交合变化) as **neither movement nor stillness** (无动无静), then Heaven would have **times of rupture** (有时而裂), and Earth would have **times of eruption** (有时而发). When the **One opens and closes** (一阖一辟), when it **moves and stirs** (一动一静), it **cycles the sun and moon** (运日月) to **divide day and night** (分昼夜), it **varies warmth and coolness** (变温凉) to **determine cold and heat** (定寒暑). All this is **continuous and enduring** (绵绵若存).\n\nHence, Liezi said: **\"The Original Qi does not advance suddenly** (一气不顿进), **and form does not diminish suddenly** (一形不顿亏)—this is its **moderation** (有节).\" Is it not because of **reaching the utmost emptiness and nurturing the spirit** (虚极而运神), **deep stillness and focused qi** (静笃而专气), that one can **flow with the Dao** (与道同流)?\n\nHeaven **cycles qi** (以气运), hence its **vaulted expanse** (穹窿) above. Earth **dwells in form** (以形处), hence its **solid bulk** (磅礡) below. This is the **natural position** (自然之位) of Heaven and Earth. **Qian** (乾) embodies **stillness and concentration** (静也专), while **Kun** (坤) embodies **movement and expansion** (动也辟). This is the **natural virtue/power** (自然之德) of Heaven and Earth. To **regard all things as grass and dogs** (刍狗), this is the **natural equity** (自然之公) of Heaven and Earth. To **respond to things with adaptability** (应物), this is the **natural principle** (自然之理) of Heaven and Earth, like the **key of a bellows** (橐钥).」",

      "translated_text": "「Speaking of the Sage’s desire to attain the **Dao/Way of Sageship**, he does not place his own body before others—this is **selfishness**. Yet in his movements and interactions, he never fails to observe the rites of **humility and deference**; others, in turn, regard him as placing theirs first.\n\nThis is **acting last yet taking precedence**—could it not be **selfishness**? As for **placing the body externally yet preserving it**, if one does not place the body externally, it will be set in a realm of **desired things**; if **desire overcomes**, harm arises, and harm to the body **injures life**.\n\nNow, those who place their bodies externally do so to **desire their own bodies** yet not to be **ensnared by external things**—only then can they preserve their bodies. To preserve one’s body is to **regard the body as private**.\n\nWhen the body suffers no harm and thus attains **long preservation**, this is **public virtue**. The Sage’s actions should not be said to be **selfish**, yet when he acts with **selfishness**, it is because at their origin he did not dare speak of them openly—thus they are called **\"deviant\"**.\n\n**\"Deviant\"** means **doubtful and seemingly contradictory**. The **Scripture** points to the Sage’s **selfishness**, saying: *\"Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he attains public virtue?\"* Do not say the Sage lacks selfishness; it is **through selfishness that he achieves public virtue**.\n\nThus, the term **\"deviant\"** refers to **placing the body last and externally** to attain selfishness. **Xu You** did not accept the name **\"Non-Action\"**—this was placing his body last, and Xu You attained his selfishness. **Bao Shu** had the **principle of sharing wealth**—this was placing his body externally, and Bao Shu attained his public virtue.\n\nYet, the **Dao/Way of selfishness** in Heaven and Earth lies in their **not self-generating**—who then knows how the **Dao** makes this **public virtue**?\n\n**Shao Ruo Qu** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure long and last because they attain selfishness.\"* Heaven and Earth endure long and last, yet they do not know of **rainbow transformations** or **misty vapors**; winds and rains follow the four seasons, and **accumulated qi** forms Heaven. Mountains and rivers, seas and lakes, metals and stones, grasses and woods—**accumulated forms** constitute Earth.\n\nWhat has form, how could it not decay? Heaven and Earth endure long and last because the **cyclical movements of the seasons** follow the **Dao/Way** as the **master of life and transformation**; Heaven and Earth, not self-generating, thus attain **long life**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage imitates them, dwelling in **humility and deference** yet never **self-exalting**. Placing his body last, his body is yet **regarded by others as first**; considering all worldly benefits as **external to the body**, he does not let them **burden him**, and thus his body is preserved for long.\n\nThe Sage’s **placing his body last** and **externally**—is it not because he has **selfishness**? He imitates Heaven and Earth in their **action-yet-non-action**, thus attaining his selfishness.\n\n**Wang Zhi Ran** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure long and last because they attain selfishness.\"* The **Dao/Way** permeates the **Four Great Elements**—within the Four Great Elements, those who attain the **Dao** and thus become great, none greater than Heaven, Earth, and the Sage.\n\nHeaven attains **One** to become **clear and pure**, its **vaulted dome** positioned **above**, its **body** as **Qian**—**unyielding, vigorous, and upright**, all things **begin from it**, **steady yet eternally in motion**. **Zhuangzi** said: *\"The **Dao/Way of Heaven** moves yet **accumulates nothing**.\"* The *I Ching* says: *\"It **simplifies** for people.\"*\n\nEarth attains **One** to become **tranquil and enduring**, its **vast expanse** positioned **below**, its **constancy** as **Kun**—**receptive and enduring**, it **supports Heaven and nourishes all**, all things **find life from it**, **relaxed yet eternally at rest**. **Zhuangzi** said: *\"The **Dao/Way of Earth** moves yet **accumulates nothing**.\"* The *I Ching* says: *\"It **simplifies** for people.\"*\n\nIn speaking of Heaven and Earth, this is **complete**. **Qian** is the **symbol of Heaven**, **Kun** the **symbol of Earth**. When **Qian** is **still**, its **specialization** is complete; when it moves, it is **direct**—thus **great life** arises. When **Kun** is **still**, its **gathering** is **concentrated**; when it moves, it **expands**—thus **broad life** arises.\n\nTherefore, Heaven attains this to **endure in clarity**, Earth attains this to **endure in tranquility**. Heaven and Earth having attained the **most simple and easy Dao/Way**, thus **survive through vast calamities** and **endure eternally**, spanning **ten thousand ages** without decay.\n\nYet what **Laozi** called *\"Heaven and Earth enduring long\"* was because they **do not self-generate**, thus they attain **long life**. To compare the Sage to Heaven and Earth—though Heaven and Earth endure long and last, their **origin is rooted in the subtle and natural essence of True One**, sharing **the same body as the Dao**, thus they **cover and load all things**, **endure and nourish all things**, **complete and perfect all things**, **guide and transform the four seasons**, their **movements and measures are boundless**—in **life**, they **store and accumulate**; in **endurance**, they **lengthen and cultivate**; in **completion**, they **perfect and ripen**; in **nourishment**, they **cover and sustain**, never once **inviting the mind**, yet **effortlessly fulfilled**, never **claiming ownership of their actions**.\n\nEven when they give life, they do not know **how they give life**. The Sage embodies Heaven and Earth’s **creative transformations**, yet **resides in the middle**, **harmonizing the Three Powers**, **discerning the Three Poles**, **uniting the Three Spirits**, **gazing upon the world below without duality**, always **taking the hearts of the people as his own**, while the people **look up to the Sage without two Daos**, always **taking the Sage’s Dao/Way as their own**.\n\nThe world **governs itself without action**. The Sage, when **forced to govern** the **State of Qi**, never **placed his body before others** though his body was yet **regarded as first**; he **externally placed his body** yet never **prioritized external things**, and the people **joyfully followed him without wearying**. As in the *Book of Poetry*: *\"From the east and from the west, from the south and from the north, none do not submit without thought.\"*\n\nAh! The **greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth** is **generation**; the **greatest treasure of the Sage** is **position**. Heaven **covers without selfishness**; Earth **loads without selfishness**. Yet Heaven can **cover** but not **load**, Earth can **load** but not **cover**—this is also **Heaven and Earth’s incomplete virtue**.\n\nObserving this from a **human perspective**, Heaven and Earth endure long and last—**indeed, they cannot be imitated or reasoned with**. Observing this from the **Dao/Way**, Heaven and Earth’s endurance is thus, yet it is **but a fleeting moment**.\n\nThus, the Sage is **not a talent born in every age**; he **harbors the potential for great action**, **public yet without selfishness**, **humble to preserve himself**, **wandering in the world’s joys and sorrows**, **sharing breath with the people**, continuing with the Sage’s **not self-possessing his body**.\n\nIs this **indeed selfishness**? Or **indeed without selfishness**? **Zhuangzi** said: *\"Non-Action and no form are like without selfishness; emotions and trust are like with selfishness.\"* Thus it is said: *\"Is it not because he lacks selfishness?\"»",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, it is precisely because he can fulfill his own selfishness. What do the learned say of this?\n\nHuang Maocai said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure long because they can fulfill their own selfishness.\"* All things draw upon Heaven and Earth to be born, yet Heaven and Earth never truly give birth to them. Humans give birth to humans, beasts to beasts, birds to birds, fish to fish, grasses and trees to grasses and trees—what part do Heaven and Earth play in this? The **Dao/Way of eternal generation** does not itself generate; thus all things undergo **transformation and renewal** while it remains unending.\n\nThat which does not generate does not die; thus Heaven and Earth endure without ceasing. If a person can align with Heaven and Earth, why should he not attain **long life**?\n\nTherefore, the Sage **preserves his body while fulfilling his virtue/power**. To **postpone one’s body** is the means to **conduct oneself in the world**; to **transcend one’s body** is the means to **embody the Dao/Way**. Now, if a person **humble and modest**, **retreating from worldly affairs**, is **praised by his neighbors** and **honored by the court**, then to **discard form and abandon wisdom**, **forsaking the world to stand alone**, he must indeed be able to **endure long**—this is clear.\n\nIs it not because he lacks selfishness? Thus he can fulfill his own selfishness. Heaven **covers without selfishness**, Earth **bears without selfishness**; the Sage **unites with Heaven and Earth in virtue/power**, and while all others perish, he alone survives. While all else wither, he alone thrives—is this not the fulfillment of his selfishness?\n\nCheng Taizhi said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure long because they can fulfill their own selfishness.\"* The later chapter states that humans can attain **long life and prolonged vision** because they **harness the years** and **make them eternal**. But if Heaven and Earth’s **eternal generation**, what does it mean to speak of **long years**?\n\nThe *I Ching* says: *\"Eternal generation is called the **Dao/Way**.\"* It is the **source of generation** that gives birth, and the **Dao/Way** that further generates from it—this is called **eternal generation**. Extending this analogy, the **crawfish (生)**, the **elderly (耆)**, and the **great enterprise (大业)**—all that is called **generation** refers to **augmenting what is not yet present**.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not generate themselves yet can **prolong this generation eternally**; this aligns with *Liezi*’s claim: *\"The **Dao/Way of eternal generation** does not generate itself, for its **Dao/Way is unfathomable**.\"* This is precisely the elaboration of that principle.\n\nAll things under Heaven are born from **substance (有)**, and **substance** arises from **non-substance (无)**. Heaven and Earth’s ability to generate all things stems from their **constant presence**, yet they never **enter into generation themselves**. Vast and decaying, they **bestow their qi** upon countless varieties, forming them.\n\nHeaven and Earth, however, **do not increase** over the ages—thus all they possess is **without loss**, all they grant is **without destruction**. Hence, they can **generate all things under Heaven** yet **never exhaust themselves**.\n\n*Liezi* further says: *\"That which is generated from generation dies, yet the **Dao/Way of eternal generation** never ends. That which takes form from form solidifies, yet the **Dao/Way of formless transformation** never remains.\"* This is the ultimate extension of that principle.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **preserves his body while fulfilling his virtue/power**. The later chapter indeed clarifies this principle, saying: *\"The Sage desires to surpass others by his words, yet he acts beneath them; desires to precede others by his actions, yet his body lags behind.\"* Thus, when he **occupies a high position**, others do not **resent him**; when he **takes the lead**, others do not **harm him**. Hence, the world **delights in pushing him forward without tiring**.\n\nTo **postpone one’s body yet have it endure first** is to **sacrifice oneself to benefit others**, and also to **refrain from contention while none can contend with him**. This principle originates from Heaven and Earth’s **not generating themselves** yet **prolonging their generation eternally**. To **transcend one’s body yet preserve it**.\n\nHumans **love their bodies** without distinction—whether noble or base, wise or foolish, all are the same. Yet if they love without **embodying the Dao/Way**, they **seek to benefit yet cause harm**. Laozi says: *\"People’s disregard for death is due to their excessive attachment to life.\"* Meaning they **cherish it so heavily** that they **do not spare themselves** in nurturing it, even to the point of inviting death.\n\nHe also says: *\"To **augment life** is called **auspicious (祥)**.\"* Meaning they **exert finite wisdom** to **pursue what life does not inherently possess**, thus **inviting disaster (祸)**. If one **excessively nurtures life** yet **loses the Dao/Way of natural generation**, and **seeks to augment life** through artificial means, then in terms of **loving one’s body**, one can say he **spares no effort**.\n\nYet, if one **pursues honor and nourishment**, he may **invite death**; if one **seeks to augment life**, he may **bring misfortune**. This is precisely because he **does not understand the principle of yielding to curves** but instead **demands straight paths**.\n\nAs for the Sage’s **preservation of his body**, there is indeed a **Dao/Way**. Knowing that **life’s coming cannot be repelled** and its **departure cannot be halted**, he **abandons worldly affairs** to **free himself from burdens**, thus attaining **equilibrium and balance**. The **Dao/Way of equilibrium and balance** is **without partiality or favor**, **without striving or envy**, and thus **Zhuangzi’s theory of life is illuminated**.\n\nIf **lowering oneself does not harm life** and **elevating oneself does not benefit life**, then what was said earlier—*\"its coming cannot be repelled\"*—does it not apply to me? **Having abandoned it, where else can it go?** Thus, his ability to **transcend this body** is precisely his means to **attain preservation**.\n\nLaozi deeply understood the **mysteries of the Dao/Way**, and all his words were **expressions of the formless**. His teachings are **not easily grasped in a single glance**, yet he **never spoke in plain terms**. He often **veiled his truth within words** while **concealing his intent beyond them**, akin to later ages’ **hidden doctrines**.\n\nThis was **not to startle the world**. If one **raises a corner** yet **does not reflect the whole**, then even if he **instructs earnestly**, it **brings no benefit**. The rest follows similarly.\n\nIs it not because he lacks selfishness? Thus he can fulfill his own selfishness.»",

The principles of the world are such that **unity** with the multitude makes them **public**, while **partiality** toward oneself makes them **private**—yet it is not necessary to **encroach upon others** for self-gain that defines selfishness. When he **positions himself** after others, yet **his actions** precede them as if without intent, his **virtue/power** naturally preserves itself. If he **acts from behind** yet others **follow him first**, as though without design, yet his **virtue/power** remains intact, then it is not by his lack of selfishness that he **fulfills his own selfishness**.\n\nZhān Qiū Pǔ said: \"Heaven and Earth endure long, **thus** they can fulfill their own selfishness.\" The *Tāo Guāng Zhāng* speaks of **concealing brilliance** to nurture clarity, thereby prolonging its radiance. Thus, Heaven and Earth endure long because they **do not selfishly assert their own virtue/power**, and in the grand **virtue/power** of **generation**, they can achieve **longevity**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **embodies the law** of Heaven and Earth: he **acts from behind** yet his **virtue/power** stands first, **externalizes himself** yet his **virtue/power** remains firmly preserved. Is this not because his lack of selfishness allows him to **fulfill his own selfishness**? It is all through **concealing brilliance** and not **boasting of his light** that this is so.\n\nZhāng Chōng replied: \"Heaven and Earth endure long because they **do not selfishly assert their own virtue/power**.\" Heaven’s clarity **endures and covers** all things, long-lasting and unshaken; Earth’s depth **bears and sustains**, enduring and unyielding. Why is this? Because Heaven **endures without selfishly generating its own presence**, it **forgets its own celestial form** yet **covers all things**, the Dao **silently operating** without excess, and Heaven **naturally** endures. Earth **endures without selfishly generating its own substance**, it **forgets its own earthly shape** yet **sustains all things**, the Dao **silently operating** without ceasing, and Earth **naturally** endures. What is meant by **not selfishly generating** is that the Dao **generates itself within me**, silently operating without end, yet **I do not seek its source in my own generation**, so Heaven **forms without form** and Earth **substances without shape**—thus their enduring nature.\n\nThe Sage is the one who **perfects the Dao** in the world. Knowing how Heaven and Earth endure, he **aligns his body with the Dao**, not making the Dao his own body. He **honors others** yet does not **honor himself**, so others honor him while he himself remains honored. He **bestows generosity** upon others yet does not **hoard it for himself**, so others grow rich while he himself remains rich. By **humbling and diminishing himself**, he **precedes others** while **preserving his own virtue/power**—this is the **function of concealing brilliance and not selfishly generating**.\n\nIf he **conceals yet acts**, as though from **no selfishness**, but **reflects upon it** and finds **fulfillment for himself**, then what is said of him is indeed **selfishness for himself**. Those who **study the Dao** must **reverse-track its concealed brilliance**.\n\nBái Yù Chán said: \"Heaven and Earth endure long. **Silently without action**.\" Heaven and Earth endure long because **they are thus**. The heart is also so. Because **it does not selfishly generate**, the heart **endures long**. Thus, one can achieve **longevity**. It is **originally without birth or death**. Therefore, the Sage: **I am the same**. I **act from behind** yet my **virtue/power** stands first, **present without absence**. I **externalize myself** yet my **virtue/power** remains preserved—**such is the way of all time**. Is it not because of his **lack of selfishness**? Heaven and Earth share the same **root** with me; all things share the same **body** with me. Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness. **I am Heaven and Earth**; Heaven and Earth are **I**. Liào Cuìrán said: \"Heaven and Earth endure long because **spirit is born from form**, and form can **perfect spirit**. When form and spirit **harmonize**, they **prolong endlessly**. Heaven and Earth endure long because **form and spirit are both immortal**. It is because **they do not selfishly generate**. Form cannot be without spirit to **generate**, spirit cannot be without form to **perfect**. Thus, one can achieve **longevity**. Thus, they **mutually generate** and **mutually perfect**. From ancient times to today, their **name** does not fade.\n\nTherefore, the Sage: **master of affairs and people**, I am the same. I **act from behind** yet my **virtue/power** stands first—**humble yet exalted, radiant**. I **externalize myself** yet my **virtue/power** remains preserved—**retreat and hide in secrecy**, like a hen brooding her eggs. Is it not because of his **lack of selfishness**? **Originally without attachment**, yet **all emotions are obtained**. Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness. When **public affairs are managed**, then **private affairs are also managed**. Form and spirit **both achieve perfection**, and **harmonize with the Dao**. Chén Bìxū said: \"Heaven and Earth endure long—**this is the standard**. Heaven, with its **vast qi**, covers all things, **unshaken from ancient to modern times**, hence called **enduring**. Earth, with its **substantial form**, bears all things, **permanently fixed from beginning to end**, hence called **unyielding**. The **analogy** is used to **establish meaning**, found in the following text.\n\nWhy Heaven and Earth endure long—**this is the question**. Because **they do not selfishly generate**, **this is the explanation**. Thus, they can achieve **longevity**—**this concludes the meaning**. Heaven endures in **clarity**, Earth endures in **tranquility**, because they **cover and bear all things**, **nurture and educate all beings**, yet all **draw their nature from the wondrous source**, returning to their **original emptiness**, restoring their **mysterious depths**, and **not boasting of their own generative function**, while **preserving their constant virtue/power**, thus they endure.\n\nAnother interpretation says: Heaven and Earth, along with all things, **stand alone yet transform naturally**. All **receive their nature without seeking** to **exceedingly benefit their own generation**, thus they endure. **This is a warning to be heeded**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **arrives yet his virtue/power remains preserved**. The Sage **does nothing**, yet **his body is in the hall of state** while his **heart wanders in Gūshè**. He **embodies Heaven and Earth’s covering and bearing**, **nourishing all without selfishness**, greatly **acting in humility** yet **not daring to lead the world first**. His people **rejoice and support him** without **burdening him**, **delight in promoting him** without **wearying him**, hence his **virtue/power stands first**.

Heaven and Earth **generate and nurture all things**, yet the Sage **externalizes himself to perfect the people**. All **do not use their benevolence to selfishly expand**, how could there be a **selfish heart**? It is truly **without selfishness**. Without selfishness, he can **endure long and remain steadfast**; because of his **longevity and endurance**, he knows how to **fulfill his own selfishness**.\n\nLǐ Yuē said: \"He who **does not selfishly assert himself** yet **selfishly benefits others**—when others’ selfishness is fulfilled, his own selfishness is already fulfilled.\"",

      "original_text": "《鸿烈解》曰：公仪休相鲁而嗜鱼，一国献鱼。 公仪休不受，其弟子谏曰：夫子嗜鱼，弗受何也。 答曰：夫唯嗜鱼，故弗受。 夫受鱼而免於相，虽嗜鱼不能自给鱼； 无受鱼而不免於相，则能长自给鱼。 此明於为人为己者也。 故曰非以其无私耶？ 故能成其私。 谢图南曰：天长地久至故能长生。 天之高也，地之厚也，生乎太极，至乎无极，可谓长且久矣。 所以然者，天地以生物为心，未尝自生，此所以能长生也。 是以圣人至而身存。 圣人法天地，以生养万民为心。 后其身，不自为也，而身常先。 外其身，不自有也，而身常存。 此所以可与天地并立也。 非以其无私耶？ 故能成其私。 天地不自生，是无私也。 而日月星辰系焉，华岳河海载焉，非能成其私乎？ 圣人不为己，是无私也，而国家天下安焉，宗庙社稷享焉，非能成其私乎？ 至公一理，不可磨灭，是乃长久之道。 天地圣人，皆不外此。 盖尝论之，天下之理，惟公而已。 天无私覆，地无私载，王者奉无私以劳天下。 经曰：公乃王，王乃天，天乃道，道乃久。 然则天地圣人皆以至公一理并立域中，所以长久而不穷也。 后世剥下以奉上，瘠人而肥己，暴秦鞭笞六合而混一宇内，孤隋并吞群盗而奄有中原，可谓得志矣。 然不再传而亡，宗庙不保，社稷丘墟。 则公之与私，其得失亦可见矣。 林庸齐曰：天长地久至故能成其私。 此章以天地喻圣人无容心之意。 天地之生万物，自然而然，无所容心，故千万岁犹一日也。 圣人之修身，无容心於先后，无容心於内外，故莫之先而常存。 是以其无私，而能成其私也。 此一私字，是就身上说来，非公私之私也。 若以私为公私之私，则不得谓之无容心矣。 此语又是老子诱人为善之意。 及释氏翻出来，则无此等语矣，故谓之真空、实有。 真空便是无私之意，实有便是能成其私之意。 但说得来，文高似一层。 范应元曰：天长地久至故能长生。 有形之长久者，莫如天地。 天地均由道而生，所以能长且久者，以其安於无私，而不自益其生，故能长生也。 河上公曰：谓天地长生久寿，以喻教人。 是以圣人至而身存。 圣人谦下，不与人争先，而人自然尊之。 圣人无争，不与物为敌，而物莫能害之。 非以其无私耶？ 故能成其私。 谓圣人谦下无争，非以其无私邪，此言其实无私也。 而人自然尊之，物莫能害之。 盖以其无私，故能成其私也。 圣人成其私者，非私曲也。 非私邪也，谓众人之自益其生，所以不能得先且存，而圣人之谦下无争，所以独能得先且存也。 薛庸齐曰：天长地久至故能成其私。 形数既具，成坏便分。 天地岂长久者耶？ 所以能长久者，以其生生而不自生，故能长生也。 谦尊而光，卑而不可踰，后其身而身先也。 不以死生富贵累其心，则神全，外其身而身存也。 尧让天下於许由，舜让天下於善卷，以其无私，故能成其私也。 休休庵曰：天长地久至故能成其私。 有相之物难逃成住坏空四劫，惟天地所以能长久者，非自生也。 一气发而现二仪，真气运行无始无终，故能长生。 圣人者，天地位后始现有相之身，三才显而世界成矣。 身先者，灵明真性在太极前而有已。 外其身而身存者，人能建立世界而不滞着，谓之物外身，世界有坏，真性无坏。",
      "translated_text": "*The **Honglie Exegesis** states:*\n\nWhen **Gongyi Xiu** served as minister of **Lu** and craved fish, the entire state presented him with fish. **Gongyi Xiu** refused to accept them. His disciple remonstrated: *\"Master, you love fish—why refuse them?\"* He replied: *\"Precisely because I love fish, I refuse them. If I accept the fish and lose my ministerial post, even if I love fish, I cannot sustain myself with them. If I refuse the fish and do not lose my post, then I can forever sustain my love of fish.\"* This demonstrates his understanding of **serving others while benefiting oneself**. Hence it is said: *\"Is it not because of his lack of selfishness? Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness.\"*\n\n**Xie Tunan** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they attain longevity. Heaven’s height and Earth’s depth—born from the **Great Ultimate**, reaching the **Boundless**—truly endure long and steadfast. This is so because Heaven and Earth take **nurturing all things** as their heart; they never seek to sustain themselves, hence their eternal life. Therefore, when the Sage arrives, his body is preserved. The Sage follows Heaven and Earth, taking **nurturing the myriad people** as his heart. He places his own body last, not acting for himself, yet his body is always foremost. He externalizes his body, not possessing it himself, yet his body is always preserved. This is why he can stand alongside Heaven and Earth. Is it not because of his lack of selfishness? Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness. Heaven and Earth do not sustain themselves—this is lack of selfishness. Yet the sun, moon, stars, and constellations depend upon them; the **Hua Mountains**, rivers, and seas bear them—is this not fulfilling their own selfishness? The Sage does not act for himself—this is lack of selfishness—yet the state and the world are at peace, ancestral temples and altars are honored—is this not fulfilling his own selfishness? The utmost fairness is an unalterable principle; this is the **Dao of enduring longevity**. Heaven, Earth, and the Sage all adhere to this. Indeed, examining the principles of the world, only fairness prevails. Heaven covers without selfishness, Earth bears without selfishness; the **Sage** governs with fairness to labor for the people. The **Classics** say: *'Fairness is kingship; kingship is Heaven; Heaven is the **Dao**; the **Dao** endures.'* Thus, Heaven, Earth, and the Sage all stand together in the world through this utmost fairness, hence their enduring longevity without exhaustion.\n\nLater ages, however, impoverished the lower to enrich the upper, starving the people to fatten themselves. **Qin Shihuang** flogged the world to unify the realm, and **Emperor Yang of Sui** swallowed bandits to monopolize the Central Plains—truly, they achieved their ambitions. Yet their dynasties collapsed within two generations, their ancestral temples ruined, their altars in ruins. Thus, the gains and losses of fairness and selfishness are evident.\n\n**Lin Yongqi** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* This chapter uses Heaven and Earth to illustrate the Sage’s **heart of no contrivance**. Heaven and Earth generate all things naturally, without contrivance, hence their ten thousand years pass like a single day. The Sage cultivates himself without contriving in precedence or sequence, without contriving in inner or outer—thus, though none precede him, he always endures. Hence, though he is without selfishness, he fulfills his own selfishness. This *\"selfishness\"* refers to his body’s preservation, not the selfishness of public and private. If *\"selfishness\"* were taken as public-private selfishness, then it could not be called **heart of no contrivance**. These words are **Laozi’s** way of guiding people toward goodness. When the **Buddhist school** reinterpreted them, such language vanished, hence they speak of **true emptiness, real existence**. True emptiness is the meaning of **lack of selfishness**; real existence is the meaning of **fulfilling his own selfishness**. Yet their phrasing, though lofty, is a layer removed.\n\n**Fan Yingyuan** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they attain longevity.\"* Among formed things, none endure like Heaven and Earth. Both arise from the **Dao**, hence their enduring longevity stems from their **resting in lack of selfishness**, not seeking to benefit themselves, thus they attain eternal life. **Riverbank Master** said: *\"This speaks of Heaven and Earth’s eternal life to instruct people.\"* Therefore, when the Sage arrives, his body is preserved. The Sage is humble and does not contend for precedence, yet people naturally revere him. The Sage does not contend, does not oppose things, yet nothing can harm him. Is it not because of his lack of selfishness? Thus, he fulfills his own selfishness. The Sage fulfills his own selfishness—not in crookedness, not in wickedness—but because common people seek to benefit themselves, hence they cannot attain precedence and preservation, while the Sage’s humility and non-contention alone enable him to attain precedence and preservation.\n\n**Xue Yongqi** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* Once form and number are complete, formation and decay are inevitable. Are Heaven and Earth truly enduring? Their enduring longevity comes from **generating without self-generation**, hence their eternal life. Humble yet radiant, low yet uncrossable—placing his body last, yet his body is foremost. Not burdened by death, life, wealth, or nobility, his spirit is whole; externalizing his body, yet his body is preserved. **Emperor Yao** ceded the realm to **Xuyou**, **Emperor Shun** to **Shan Jun**, because of their lack of selfishness, thus they fulfilled their own selfishness.\n\n**Restful Retreat Hermit** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* All formed things escape not the four **kalpas** of arising, dwelling, decay, and emptiness. Only Heaven and Earth endure because they do not self-generate. **Qi** emanates to manifest the **Two Principles**, true **qi** circulating without beginning or end, hence their eternal life. The Sage is the **Three Powers’** manifestation after Heaven and Earth, the world thus formed. **Body foremost**—his luminous true nature precedes the **Great Ultimate** yet is already present. **Externalizing his body, yet his body preserved**—if one establishes the world without clinging, this is called **body beyond things**; though the world decays, true nature does not decay.",
      "overlap_context": "mself to perfect the people**. All **do not use their benevolence to selfishly expand**, how could there be a **selfish heart**? It is truly **without selfishness**. Without selfishness, he can **endure long and remain steadfast**; because of his **longevity and endurance**, he knows how to **fulfill his own selfishness**.\n\nLǐ Yuē said: \"He who **does not selfishly assert himself** yet **selfishly benefits others**—when others’ selfishness is fulfilled, his own selfishness is already fulfilled.\"",

      "translated_text": "「Is it not because of their lack of selfishness? True nature differs from things, thus it can well fulfill its own selfishness.»\n\n**Chu Bo-xiu** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* Indeed, since the **cosmic chaos** (*hun-dun*) first divided, the light and clear ascend and float upward, while the heavy and turbid descend and sink downward. The **principle of existence and nonexistence** (*you-wu*) and the **vessel of Dao** (*dao-qi*) rely on each other to stand, spanning the ages without ceasing their transformative and generative processes—thus they endure. Why is this so? It is because they do not self-generate. To self-generate is to cling to self and fail to give birth to things; how could they then endure eternally?\n\nThe Sage manifests **body foremost** (*shen-xian*) and **body beyond things** (*wu-wai-shen*), merely abandoning selfishness for the sake of the public, emulating Heaven and following Earth’s ways to nourish the people and cultivate all things. All who practice humility, dwell in lowliness, do not presume to be first, decline merit and yield to ability, and retreat to preserve their whole—these are acts of **body foremost**. Yet when the world joyfully acclaims them, they cannot but assume the lead.\n\nTo dwell in humble thatched huts, eat coarse grasses, guard true nature while cherishing self, awaken from the dream of life and death—these are acts of **body beyond things**, yet they surpass the pursuit of noble life, and thus their preservation is inevitable.\n\nThe **gentleman** (*jun-zi*) does good, fulfilling what is rightfully his due. Does he seek reward for it? Heaven’s aid to the virtuous is without a shred of private intent; it follows by kindred nature, like an echo answering a call. The Sage embodies Heaven’s impartiality, follows the Dao’s generative virtue, fearing only that one thing might lose its place—thus Heaven’s response and divine blessings are complete. Though human affairs may seem to fulfill selfishness, in truth they arise from Heaven’s utmost impartiality; thus his blessings and rejoicings are without shame.\n\nWhen the **gentleman** receives blessings, is it not for his own honor? No—it is to extend virtue to the people, broadening Heaven and Earth’s **great virtue** (*da-de*). If one does good while harboring even a trace of selfish gain, then it is not true goodness; its end may even lead to evil. Can one not be cautious at its beginning?\n\n**Niu Miao-zhuan** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* Heaven is the accumulation of **yang** (*yang*), thus it can fulfill its function and cover all; it spans the ages without wearing down, hence it is called ‘long.’ Earth is the accumulation of **yin** (*yin*), thus it can fulfill its function and bear all; it endures through the **kalpas** without decay, hence it is called ‘durable.’ Yet why do they endure both long and durable? It is because Heaven and Earth do not presume to be able to endure; thus they endure. They do not presume to be able to fulfill their own selfishness; thus they fulfill it.\n\n**Lie Zi** said: *\"There is life that does not generate, and there is non-generation that can generate life. The generating cannot help but generate, thus it is always generating. Always generating is without a time that does not generate, but non-generation is singular. Singular non-generation—its Dao is unfathomable.\"* Is this not so?\n\nThus the Sage manifests **body foremost** and **body beyond things**. The Sage is the **humble gentleman** (*qian-qian jun-zi*). Why is this so? Did not Confucius say, *\"The Sage—whom I cannot see, but if I see a gentleman, that is enough\"*? Those who do not dare to be first, but instead place themselves after others—are they not the **humble gentlemen**?\n\n**Lao Zi** said: *\"He who does not dare to be first under Heaven can thus fulfill his function and endure.\"* Confucius also said: *\"First act according to your words, then follow them.\"* In ancient times, **Hu Qiu Zi Lin** told **Lie Zi**: *\"If you know how to hold back, then you can know how to hold yourself.\"* **Lie Zi** said: *\"I wish to hear of holding back.\"* He replied: *\"Look at your shadow, and you will know.\"* The ancients referred to \"you\" as \"shadow.\"\n\n**Lie Zi** looked back and observed his shadow: when his form bent, the shadow curved; when his form straightened, the shadow stood upright. Thus, bending and straightening follow his form, not his shadow; yielding and extending follow things, not himself. This is called **holding back while assuming the lead**.\n\nIs this not the saying? **Body beyond things** preserves itself.\n\nThe **body** is but the **manifestation** (*wei-xing*) of Heaven and Earth’s entrusted form, thus Dao encompasses the **Four Great Elements** (*si-da*), and **virtue** fulfills the **Five Constants** (*wu-chang*), making it the most **spirited** of all things. Those who value their **body** place merit and fame beyond consideration, store Heaven’s principle within their chests—thus they can preserve their **body**, safeguard their life, and complete their years.\n\nIf one flaunts their talents and covets fame, then they cannot escape the afflictions of the **body**. The ancients said: *\"Straight wood is felled first; sweet wells run dry first. The elephant loses its life for its tusks; the fragrant pine is burned for its scent.\"* **Zhuang Zi** said: *\"When achievements are complete, the vessel is broken; when fame is attained, the virtue is lost.\"* Who can abandon fame and achievement, returning to share with the common people?\n\n**Lao Zi** said: *\"He who externalizes Heaven and Earth has Heaven and Earth; he who externalizes his body has longevity.\"* This is the saying.\n\nIn the present age, many **gentlemen** endanger their **body** and abandon their life—is this not tragic? Is it not because of their lack of selfishness that they fulfill their own selfishness?\n\nThis is truly speaking of the Sage’s **body foremost** and **body beyond things**, not of one who acts without mind. When the Sage assumes **body foremost** and **body beyond things** to fulfill the policies of the Sage, it is indeed due to the operation of selfishness—thus it is called *fulfill their own selfishness*.\n\nThe **lack of selfishness** is to say **non-action** (*wu-wei*). *Fulfilling their own selfishness* is **action** (*you-wei*). Moreover, there is no affair under Heaven that can be accomplished without action or achieved without effort. **Non-action** is the Sage’s **true nature** (*ti*); **action** is the Sage’s **application** (*yong*). When **true nature** and **application** are both complete, only then does the Sage’s Dao manifest—how could one cling to **non-action** and hinder *fulfilling their own selfishness*?\n\nIf a person lacks selfishness, then how do they differ from **clay and wooden figures** (*tu-mu ou-ren*)? **Lao Zi** said: *\"If one speaks of ‘no mind,’ then Dao itself has no mind. It is still one layer of mountain apart.\"* This is truly speaking of knowing **true nature** but not **application**.\n\n**Yang Zhi-ren** said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* Heaven’s **emptiness** (*xu*) reaches its utmost, thus it endures; Earth’s **thick bearing** (*hou-zai*) is vast, thus it is durable. Because they do not self-generate, they rely on the **rotation of the sun and moon** (*ri-yue xuan-zhuan*) to generate, thus they can fulfill their own selfishness. If Heaven did not rotate, the sun and moon would not shine; if Earth were to dry up, all things would not generate.\n\nThe **human body**—its **inherent nature** (*ben-xing*) is called Heaven; its **original mandate** (*yuan-ming*) is called Earth.",

Thus, the generator of all things is Heaven and Earth, and their **eternal generation** is what allows all things to thrive. **Eternal life** is spoken of when generation is mentioned, for endurance is inherent within it.\n\nThe heart of Heaven and Earth is a heart of **universal impartiality**. The Sage embodies this universal impartiality of Heaven and Earth, placing themselves after Heaven and Earth yet leading in heart. They place themselves last, yet others revere them first.\n\nNot possessing what they have, they preserve it. They transcend the body, yet the body endures. Is this not because selflessness enables such attainment? Selflessness is universality—only the selfless can truly fulfill their own selfishness. Those who embody the **Heavenly Mandate** naturally return to it, without expectation or contrivance. Though it seems selfish, it is truly universal.\n\nXū Liùxū said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they attain eternal life.\"* Heaven’s endurance and Earth’s durability—this is the central theme of this passage. What follows is its elucidation. Yet by reasoning that they do not generate themselves, one concludes that Heaven and Earth endure and last because they do not contrive their own existence. If Heaven and Earth had a self-serving intent to prolong their lives, how could they truly endure?\n\nThus, when the Sage arrives, the body is preserved. The Sage places themselves last, yet others revere them first, following the Dao of Heaven and Earth in not generating themselves. They hold fast to humility and retreat, so the world naturally honors them as first. Those who transcend the body know that the body is not truly theirs; through **non-action, tranquility, and emptiness**, nothing can harm them. The body is naturally transcended—not by deliberate effort, but by natural detachment. Thus, the body is preserved.\n\nIs this not because of their selflessness? Hence, they fulfill their own selfishness.\n\nThe Sages attain **leading by example and eternal preservation** because they follow the Dao of Heaven and Earth in not generating themselves, not by selfish intent. Thus, they achieve the fulfillment of **leading by example and eternal preservation**.\n\nChái Yuángāo said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally—unchangeably.\"* Heaven and Earth endure because they fulfill their roles of covering and bearing all things, shaping forms naturally without contrivance. Thus, when the Sage arrives, the body is preserved. They diminish themselves to enrich others; others naturally honor them. They abandon self for the benefit of all, yet do not take from others. They do not act selfishly, yet fulfill their own selfishness. They forget their own selfish desires and fulfill the expectations of others. This is how the Sage aligns with the enduring Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nSū Jìngjìng said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* Since ancient times, none have matched Heaven and Earth in endurance. Yet who truly understands why Heaven and Earth endure? The **Supreme Ultimate Dao** truly generates them, yet Heaven and Earth do not generate themselves. If they were to grow alongside all things, they would merely be one thing among many—how could they then attain eternal life?\n\nHeaven and Earth stand above all things, yet do not compete with them, thus they endure eternally. The Sage understands this, always placing the world before themselves and their body last. When the people are hungry, they dare not indulge in satiety while others starve; when the people are cold, they dare not wear heavy garments while others shiver. They treat the people with the intimacy of father and son, yet do not dare to neglect them as distant relatives; they treat them as brothers, yet do not dare to exclude them.\n\nThough the Sage places themselves last, the world reveres them first. Though they transcend the body, the world preserves them. Just as Heaven and Earth, by not generating themselves, endure eternally in their generation, so too does the Sage, by placing themselves last and transcending the body, not dare to act selfishly for their own sake. Yet the people wish to honor the Sage’s body, to preserve the Sage’s life. The Sage wishes to retreat, yet the people honor them first; the Sage wishes to transcend, yet the people preserve them. Is this not fulfilling their own selfishness?\n\nThus, it is known that those who are not self-serving are truly able to fulfill their selfishness.\n\nBěn Yī’ān Chúshì said: *\"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness.\"* To complete all things is to complete oneself. Common people see the self and others as distinct, thus they eagerly seek to fulfill their selfishness. Yet those who are selfish ultimately gain no benefit, while those who are selfless paradoxically achieve self-fulfillment. This is the natural order.\n\nNow, consider how Heaven and Earth treat all things: they scatter with wind and nourish with rain, stir with thunder and illuminate with sun and moon. All is done solely for the sake of generating all things.",

thus,\nnever opposing things,\nso there is no blame.\nDu Guangting says:\n*The Superior is like water.*\nThe Superior cultivates the Dao and refines the heart,\nadapting to changes with the times,\nmoving freely to benefit beings.\nThe Master Lao wished to reveal the Superior’s virtue\nto encourage later learners,\ncomparing water to the Dao,\nthus using water as an analogy.\nThe Superior’s goodness\nforgets its own goodness,\nlike water not boasting of its deeds—\nwater’s deeds are greater when unboasted,\nvirtue shines brighter when unvaunted.\nGreat and bright,\nthis is the highest goodness.\n\nFrom the sovereign on high\nto the recluse in the rocks,\nif one is like water,\nthen the Dao is attained.\nThe analogy uses water as metaphor,\nthe Dao as principle,\nand the Superior Person as its practitioner.\n\nWater excels in benefiting what others despise.\nSweetness is water’s flavor.\nDepth is water’s essence.\nWater is the mother of *qi*,\nruling the North,\nits virtue is to nourish below.\nIts color is black,\nits nature is wisdom,\nits taste is salty,\nits number is six.\nThe North is the beginning of Yang virtue,\nthe end of Yin *qi*.\nIts generative number is one,\nmatching the Dao.\nThe Dao is also one—\nthe one without a one,\nwater is also one—\nthe one with a one.\nThe one without a one is the Dao’s essence,\nthe one with a one is the Dao’s function.\nThus, water is the Dao’s function.\nAll things rely on its nourishment to flourish,\nand because it nourishes,\nit gives rise to all things,\nthus it ranks first among the three capabilities.\n\nGentleness is water’s virtue.\n*The Dao De Jing*, Chapter 41, says:\n*Nothing in the world is softer than water,*\n*yet it overcomes the hardest things.*\nAgain, water’s virtue is emphasized to encourage embracing gentleness.\n\nWater, when level, does not flow;\nlaw follows equanimity as its foundation,\nthus it can be emulated.\nWater’s stillness reflects things.\nHence it is said:\n*No one mirrors themselves in flowing water,*\n*but in still water.*\nBecause it is clear and tranquil.\nWater’s nature is level—\nwhen encountering unevenness, it passes;\nwhen meeting marshes, it stops.\nEast, west, south, north—\nit follows where it is led,\nnever contending with others,\nnothing it cannot traverse.\nComparing all virtues,\nit is said its generative function is unmatched,\nthus it ranks second among the three capabilities.\n\nHuman nature follows convention for the many,\nbut few are humble and yielding.\nMost love high positions,\nfearing lowly ones.\nOnly water\ndwells low without contention,\nresides in filth without shame.\nCompared to the previous virtues,\nthis one surpasses them,\nthus it ranks third among the three capabilities.\nThus it nears the Dao.\n\nIf the ruler embodies the virtue of boundless aid,\nholds a humble and yielding heart,\nand practices containing impurity,\nthen the world will be at peace.\nFor those cultivating the self,\ntheir efforts extend to all things—\ngentleness governs nature,\ndwelling in filth to follow the common,\nabandoning traces while humbly shining,\nthen immortality may be hoped for.\n\n**On dwelling in the lowly:**\nThis clarifies delighting in humility\nas the way to preserve the state and body.\nThe sky’s purity and lightness\nmake it use its height,\nthe earth’s turbidity and thickness\nmake it rest in lowliness.\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*The sky is exalted, the earth is lowly,*\n*low and high are arranged.*\nAgain:\n*The earth’s way is low yet ascends.*\nWater follows lowliness and dwells beneath,\nmirroring the Superior’s humble virtue.\n\n**On a profound heart:**\nThis clarifies clarity, tranquility, and emptiness\nas the method for purifying the self and washing the heart.\n*A minister’s heart is like water,*\n*a minister’s gate is like a market.*\nIs this not so?\n\n**On generous giving:**\nThis clarifies nourishing all things\nas the conduct of universal aid and rescue.\nThe more one gives to others,\nthe more one possesses;\nthe more one gives away,\nthe more one has.\nThis is the meaning.\n\n**On truthful speech:**\nThis clarifies sincerity without deceit\nas the eternal and verified teaching.\n*Flowing through peril does not lose its truth*—\n*The Book of Changes*, the *Kàn* hexagram, says:\n*Habitual Kàn—*\n*double peril.*",

      "translated_text": "**On the Virtue of Non-Contention in the Common and the Lowly:**\n\nIf a high official harbors even one of these [vices],\n*he will bring ruin to his household.*\nIf a commoner harbors even one of these,\n*harm will arise within himself.*\n\nAll such contention stems from\n*lack of thought and reflection,*\n*transgressing rites and laws,*\n*without fear or reverence,*\n*without tolerance or forbearance—*\n*thus contention arises.*\n\nTherefore, those who contend over cities\n*fill the city with slaughtered men,*\nand those who contend over land\n*fill the fields with slaughtered men.*\nOne must examine the roots of contention,\n*block its source,*\n*and then all will be in harmony.*\n\nThe saying goes:\n*The virtuous person contends not.*\nAgain it is said:\n*In ugliness, one does not contend.*\nThe lower scriptures say:\n*The Dao of the Sage is to act without contending.*\nWhat fault could there be in the virtue of non-contention?\n\n**The Four Virtues of the Highest Good:**\n\n*The Empty-Hearted*—\n*the empty-hearted have no desires.*\n*The Flexibly Whole*—\n*the flexibly whole bend themselves to preserve others.*\n*The Flowing Wave*—\n*the flowing wave follows nature’s ease,*\n*the decadent and slack—*\n*the decadent and slack abandon restraint without hindrance.*\n\n*The Flowing Wave*—\nAs *Zhuangzi* says in *\"The Response of the Emperor\"*:\n*\"Transformation and decay flow like the tides,*\n*the affairs of the world surge like waves—*\n*nothing remains unchanged.\"*\n\n*The Yielding-Compliant*—\n*the yielding-compliant surrender their heart to the Way.*\n\n**The Three Abilities:**\nTo embody these four virtues,\nto follow these three abilities—\n*this is the key to national peace and longevity.*\n\nAs *Dao Jun of Song* said:\n*The highest good is like water.*\n\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*\"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao,*\n*and what follows it is called virtue.\"*\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"To separate virtue from the Dao.\"*\n\nOnce virtue is named,\n*the essence of the Dao is diminished.*\nYet heaven generates water from the One,\n*not yet far from the Dao.*\nDeep and void, still and clear—\n*this is called the utmost refinement in the world.*\n\nThus, the highest good is like water.\nWater is supremely beneficial,\n*nearly approaching the Dao.*\n\nIt condenses into rain and dew,\n*nourishing all things;*\nit freezes into frost and snow,\n*forming all treasures;*\nit flows as rivers and lakes,\n*gathering in pools and marshes.*\nDeep springs and vast seas\n*draw and store,*\n*enriching life and growth—*\n*all things rely on it without depletion.*\nIn benefiting others,\n*what is more excellent than this?*\n\nBenefiting all things,\n*all things receive its grace,*\n*its bestowal,*\n*yet it remains in the humble, weak, non-contending place.*\nIt absorbs filth and dirt,\n*without burdening itself with self-regard,*\n*thus it is close to the Dao.*\n\n*Ji*—near.\n\n**The Six Virtues of Water:**\n\n*Residing in the good place.*\nFlowing through the earth,\n*it fills without overflowing.*\n*The good heart is deep.*\n*The deeper it is measured,*\n*the deeper it becomes;*\n*the further it is explored,*\n*the more distant it grows.*\n*The good is kind.*\n*It loves all without partiality,*\n*gives without choosing.*\n*The good word is trustworthy.*\n*Avoiding obstacles, it reaches the seas;*\n*traversing dangers, it never loses its truth.*\n*The good governance is orderly.*\n*It purifies the impure,*\n*levels the steep,*\n*follows nature effortlessly,*\n*without scheming in its heart—*\n*thus all is governed.*\n*The good skill is adaptable.*\n*It bends to the land’s curves and straightness,*\n*to the vessel’s roundness and angles;*\n*it adapts to constant change*\n*yet remains ever balanced.*\n*The good action is timely.*\n*When released, it flows east;*\n*when directed, it flows west—*\n*it moves without constraint,*\n*proper only in its season.*\n\nOnly by not contending\n*does one avoid blame.*\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao,\n*thus preserving the body for enduring life,*\n*and benefiting others*\n*while dwelling in the non-contending place.*\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Is it easy to have and yet do nothing with it?\"*\n*It is easy to do nothing and commit few faults,*\n*but difficult to act and yet have no regrets.*\n*Once one benefits others through action,*\n*to remain blameless becomes difficult.*\n\nThe highest good benefits others like water’s nature—\n*it benefits without choosing what to benefit,*\n*it does not contend with others,*\n*and thus none can contend with it,*\n*hence no blame arises.*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Under heaven, nothing is as soft and weak as water,*\n*yet in attacking the hard and strong,*\n*nothing can surpass it.\"*\n\n*Wang Anshi* said:\n*The highest good is like water.*\n*What is called \"good\" can follow the Dao,*\n*yet it cannot exhaust the Dao—*\n*thus the person of highest good is like water.*\n\nWater’s nature is to benefit all things,\n*all things rely on water to live,*\n*yet water’s nature is supremely soft and weak—*\n*thus it does not contend.*\n\nPeople prefer the high and despise the low,\n*yet water dwells where people despise.*\n\n**Residing in the good place—**\n*The good place is low.*\n**The good heart is deep—**\n*Deep is still.*\n**The good is kind—**\n*It gives without seeking return.*\n**The good word is trustworthy—**\n*Even if bent a thousand times, it flows east.*\n**The good governance is orderly—**\n*The most yielding overcomes the world’s hardness.*\n**The good skill is adaptable—**\n*If square, it becomes square; if round, it becomes round.*\n**The good action is timely—**\n*In spring it rises; in winter it freezes.*\n\nAs *Su Yingbin* said:\n*The highest good is like water,*\n*thus nearly approaching the Dao.*\n\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*\"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao,*\n*and what follows it is called virtue,*\n*what fulfills it is called nature.\"*\n*Again it says:*\n*\"Heaven generates water from the One.\"*\n*Just as the Dao moves to become virtue,*\n*so too does qi move to generate water.*\nThus it is said:\n*The highest good is like water.*\n\nBoth arise from the formless and take form—\n*their principles are the same.*\nThe Dao is everywhere, benefiting all,\n*and so too is water.*\n\nYet once they have taken form,\n*they diverge from the Dao.*\nThus it is said:\n*\"Nearly approaching the Dao.\"*\n\nYet nothing can be named as good\n*as this—*\n*thus it is called the highest good.*\n\n**From Residing in the Good Place to Acting in Due Time:**\n\n*Avoiding the high, seeking the low,*\n*never opposing—*\n*this is the good place;*\n*Empty, still, silent, unfathomable—*\n*this is the good depth;*\n*Benefiting all things,*\n*giving without seeking return—*\n*this is the good kindness;*\n*Round, it turns; square, it bends;*\n*blocked, it stops; released, it flows—*\n*this is the good trustworthiness;*\n*Purifying all filth,*\n*leveling high and low—*\n*this is the good governance;*\n*Encountering things, it takes their form,*\n*yet does not cling to one—*\n*this is the good skill;*\n*In winter it freezes, in spring it thaws,*\n*in drought it recedes, in flood it swells—*\n*this is the good timing.*\n\nOnly by not contending\n*does one avoid blame.*\n\nEven if one has virtue,\n*they are not free from human censure—*\n*for they contend.*",

is like water.*\n\nThe interplay of yin and yang—this is the Dao.\nWhat follows is virtue.\n\nTo call it \"following\" is already to depart from the Dao,\nand thus it is no longer the body of the Dao itself.\nThe Supreme Good is the Dao’s own virtue.\n\nNot all under heaven know virtue as virtue,\nand so it is like water.\n\nWater’s virtue is in its utility—\nit nearly attains the Dao.\n\nFor water benefits all things without contending,\ndwelling where others abhor.\n\nAnd so the Supreme Good does likewise—\nyet this is still not the Dao itself,\nbut nearly so.\n\n**Residing in the Good Place.**\nThe rivers and seas rule over all valleys\nbecause they are low.\nThus, to dwell is to be in the Good Place.\n\n**The Heart as the Good Depth.**\nThe stillness of stagnant water is a depth,\nthe flow of moving water is a depth,\nand the discernment of the *guīhuáng* is a depth.\nThus, the heart is the Good Depth.\n\n**Giving is Good Kindness, Speech is Good Trustworthiness.**\nIt overflows without filling,\nit pours without exhausting—\nthus, to give is Good Kindness.\n\nIt ventures upon dangers without failing in trust—\nthus, speech is Good Trustworthiness.\n\n**Governance is Good Governance.**\nIts branches become rivers and valleys,\nits gathering becomes the seas—\nsufficient for governance, it is Good Governance.\n\n**Action is Good Skill.**\nGood governance: nothing is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the firm and strong.\nThus, in action, it is Good Skill.\n\n**Movement is Good Timing.**\nSources gush ceaselessly, day and night,\nfilling the basin before advancing.\nOnly by not contending\ndoes one avoid blame.\n\nIn essence, to emerge without contending\nand to take dwelling as foundation—\nthus it is said:\n*Only by not contending*\n*does one take first place under heaven.*\n\n**Wáng Yuànzé said:**\n*The Supreme Good is like water.*\nWater is the first of the Five Phases,\nemerging from emptiness into substance.\nNot far from the Dao, its nature is closest to it.\n\nFor when one departs from the Dao, virtue is established,\nand the Supreme Good is like water—\na natural principle of things.\n\nWater’s virtue is in its utility—\nit nearly attains the Dao.\n\nHumans have two hearts—fire—\nfire ascends and shines,\nand thus they love to contend.\nOnly when the will aligns with the Dao\ncan one transcend things without the heart overcoming them.\n\n**Residing in the Good Place.**\nDescending and flowing.\n\n**The Heart as the Good Depth.**\nDeep, still, and level—\ninternally bright, externally obscured.\n\n**Governance is Good Governance.**\nFollowing nature rather than emotion,\naccumulating softness to bear great weight.\n\n**Action is Good Skill.**\nAdapting to change—\nthus, nothing is beyond its ability.\n\n**Movement is Good Timing.**\nIf obstructed, it stops;\nif released, it flows.\nIt does not move before things,\nyet it does not lose its timing.\n\nOnly by not contending\ndoes one avoid blame.\n\nWater’s unity is unassailable by things,\nand thus it encompasses these virtues.\n\nFor it has virtue toward things\nwhile always descending before them—\nthis is why it has virtue.\n\nIf one were to willfully seek virtue,\nthey could not fulfill it.\n\nThus, the text concludes by reiterating this.\n\n**Liú Shēnpíng said:**\n*The Supreme Good is like water.*\nEmerging from non-being into being,\ndwelling in what is despised without contending,\nyet benefiting things—\nwater’s use here is nearest to the Supreme Good.\n\nWhen the heart embodies this, its name is established,\nand so it is said to be *like* water.\n\n**Giving is Good Kindness, Governance is Good Governance.**\nYet water itself has no governance—\nwhy then speak of trustworthiness and governance?\n\nBecause in discussing the virtuous person as water,\nwe extend governance to the virtuous person as well.\n\n**Movement is Good Timing.**\nVirtue inheres in water,\nand exhausts itself in my own goodness.\n\nGoodness is goodness—\nthus, to dwell is to rest in the Good Place,\nthe heart to abide in the Good Depth,\ngiving to balance Good Kindness,\nspeech to uphold Good Trustworthiness,\naction to deploy Good Skill,\nmovement to follow Good Timing.\n\nFrom *Záshuō*:\n*Movement is Good Timing*—\nfor it moves in accordance with time,\nand this is the goodness of movement.\n\nThe *Shū* also says:\n*\"Consider well before acting,\nand act only in its proper time.\"*\n\nThe *Shī* praises Nán Zhòng’s thin assault on the Western Róng,\nyet speaks of the chirping grass insects and the leaping *fúzhōng*—\nfor their movement follows its response.\n\nIf one does not move in accordance with time,\nhow could one attain this?\n\n**Liú Jùjì said:**\n*The Supreme Good is like water.*\n\nThe *Yì* says: *\"What follows the Dao is virtue.\"*\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *\"To depart from the Dao is to establish virtue.\"*\nBoth mean that from the Dao downward,\nnone are closer to virtue than this.\n\nVirtue without its own virtue—\nthis is the Supreme Good,\nlike the Supreme Virtue’s goodness.\n\nWater’s virtue is in its utility—\nit nearly attains the Dao.\n\nThe Dao generates Oneness,\nOneness generates Water—\nthus, water is near the Dao.\n\nWater’s virtue is in its moistening—\nthis is called *utility*.\nGood timing is called *not contending*.\nDescending is called *dwelling in what is despised*.\n\nTo benefit others without boasting\nis like water’s utility without contending.\n\nTo place oneself below others\nis like water dwelling where others abhor.\n\nThe Dao also benefits all things without contending,\ndwelling where others abhor—\nand water is like this.\n\nIf water is like the Dao,\nthen the Supreme Good is like water.\n\nThis is why it is near the Dao.\n\n**Residing in the Good Place.**\nVirtue takes dwelling in lowliness as its place,\nwater takes descending as its place—\nin virtue, it attains water’s place,\nand so it is said: *Residing in the Good Place.*\n\n**The Heart as the Good Depth.**\nVirtue takes stillness as its heart,\nwater takes depth and stillness as its depth—\nin virtue, it attains water’s depth,\nand so it is said: *The Heart as the Good Depth.*\n\n**Giving is Good Kindness, Speech is Good Trustworthiness.**\nVirtue takes teaching others as giving,\nwater takes benefiting things as kindness—\nin virtue, it attains water’s kindness,\nand so it is said: *Giving is Good Kindness.*\n\nVirtue takes honesty as speech,\nwater takes venturing upon dangers without failing in trust—\nin water, it attains water’s trustworthiness,\nand so it is said: *Speech is Good Trustworthiness.*\n\n**Governance is Good Governance.**\nVirtue takes rectifying oneself and others as governance,\nwater takes stirring and separating the pure and turbid as governance—\nin virtue, it attains water’s governance,\nand so it is said: *Governance is Good Governance.*\n\n**Action is Good Skill.**\nVirtue takes harmony as action,\nwater takes rounding and squaring without obstruction as skill—\nin virtue, it attains water’s skill,\nand so it is said: *Action is Good Skill.*",

can thus embrace these seven virtues\nand be aided by Heaven and assisted by humankind.\nWhat fault could there be?\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of the Sage’s matters beyond the body,\nand since the six virtues do not contend,\nthey are followed by the six virtues.\n\nLiu Ji said: *\"The highest virtue is like water, hence without blame.\"*\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Those who follow the Way are virtuous.\"*\n*Zhuangzi* also says: *\"To depart from the Way is to be virtuous.\"*\nAll say that from the Dao downward, none approach virtue as closely.\n\nHeaven’s One generates water,\nyet it is not far from the Way,\nso the highest virtue is like water.\n\nWater’s virtue benefits all things—\nthough supremely yielding and weak,\nit does not contend.\nIt dwells where people dislike,\nthus

benevolent,\nbenefiting others without seeking return.\nThose whose speech is virtuous are trustworthy,\nventuring upon dangers without failing in trust.\n\nNext, it flows; when contained, it stops—\nvirtue’s governance is good governance.\nFilling basins and advancing,\na thousand turns yet it flows east—\nvirtue’s skill is good skill.\nSource springs, ceaseless day and night—\nmovement is good timing.\n\nEmbracing these seven virtues without contending with things,\nthere is no blame.\nThis is how it nearly attains the Way.\n\nOnly the Way gathers in emptiness while water flows downward,\nnaturally without the burden of excess,\nso it is followed by *\"Hold and it will be full.\"*\n\nZhao Shizhen said: *\"First, the analogy of two things: one, yielding succession to the Way.\nThe highest virtue is like water—\nas the previous chapter says, it is not without private intent,\nyet it accomplishes its private intent.\nIt clarifies how Heaven, Earth, and the Sage\nachieve public good through private means.\nHe who can achieve public good through private means\ntruly understands the mechanisms of Heaven and humankind,\nand goes nowhere without fitting in.\nThis is the highest virtue.\nThus it is said: *The highest virtue is like water.*\n\nFor benevolence is the root of virtue,\nrighteousness is its foundation,\nrites are its adornment,\ntrust is its depth,\nwisdom is its refinement.\nEach has its virtue, yet none exhausts virtue.\nOnly water’s virtue encompasses all seven,\nso it is called the highest virtue.\nVirtue is all-encompassing.\nAll-encompassing means fully prepared—\nthis is why it is the highest virtue.\nThus, *the highest virtue is like water.*\n\nThe commentary cites *Zhuangzi*: *\"To depart from the Way is to be virtuous.\"*\nWhen virtue is named, the body of the Way is diminished,\nyet Heaven’s One generates water,\nand departing from the Way is not far.\nThis again reveals the meaning of the highest virtue.\n\n**Two, directly pointing to water’s virtue.**\nWater’s virtue benefits all—\nthus it nearly attains the Way.\nPreviously, virtue was compared to water;\nnow water’s virtue is spoken of directly.\n\nThe Five Phases: Metal generates Water.\nWhere Metal is generated, Water inherits its form and precedes it,\nthus not departing from its mother.\nYet Water is born from *Kan* (the abyss),\n*Kan* resides in the *zi* position,\nthe Yellow Palace nurtures its qi—\nthis is its proper place.\nThe lands it encompasses\nare where the divine response resides within.\n*The Hongfan* says: Heaven’s One generates Water,\nEarth’s Two generates Fire,\nFire is born from Water’s essence—*jingyi*.\nThe divine is in the essence,\nthe divine response follows as the second,\nthree Yangs are born from Water,\nWater descends while Wind ascends.\nThree Yins are born from Wind,\nWind ascends while Water descends.\nYin and Yang merge in virtue,\ndivine responses interact and apply—\nthough one Yin and one Yang,\none Wind and one Water,\ntheir origin is Heaven’s One as the root,\nso Water rises as vapor to become clouds,\nclouds transform into rain,\nall things thrive from Water and are born.\nWater’s benefit is for all under Heaven,\nthus it is said: *Water’s virtue benefits all things,*\nand it does not contend.\nAgain, one phrase cannot exhaust its virtue,\nso it is restated.\n\nNon-contending is Water’s yielding nature.\nYielding is顺 (*shùn*),顺 is not opposing things,\nthus it communicates with all.\n*Mencius* says: *\"Direct it east, it flows east;\ndirect it west, it flows west.\nDraw it, and it reaches—*\nall this is the work of yielding.\nYet Water’s nature is to descend,\nwhile human inclination favors ascent.\nThose who favor ascent dislike descent,\nand disliking descent is the common inclination.\nDescending is to dwell in lowliness—\nlowliness is the virtue of the highest.\nHe who cannot dwell in lowliness will contend,\ncontending means to precede others,\npreceding others means he cannot transcend his body.\nTranscending the body means he can be humble and modest—\nthis aligns with what was said before.\nThus it is said: *It dwells where people dislike,*\nhence it nearly attains the Way.\n*Near* means *close*.\nThe commentary says: *The Yijing* says: *\"One Yin, one Yang—this is the Way;\nthose who follow it are virtuous.\"*\nThus it is known that none approach the Way as closely as virtue.\nYet the Way is vast, seeming unworthy,\nand the world dares not submit to it—\nsubtle, beyond grasp,\nno thing can compare.\nOnly Water’s lowliness\ncan nearly approach it.\n\nNext, the seven virtues are elaborated:\n\n**One, the virtue of harmonizing.**\nDwelling in good land—\nWater and Earth together encompass,\nyet when divided, Earth is still while Water moves.\nEarth’s nature restrains Water,\nbut when Water overflows, Earth builds dikes.\nEarth cultivates grains,\nWater irrigates—\nthus Earth succeeds through Water.\nInitially, they share one breath—\nbrothers.\nAfter division, they are husband and wife.\nIf not restrained, the six would not generate,\nand harmony would not produce creation.\nThus Water moves upon the land—\nWater’s benefit lies in the land.\nLand is lowliness,\nWater is descent.\nWater and Earth share virtue,\nand cannot be separated for an instant—\nthis is why they harmonize virtues.\nHarmonizing virtues returns to their origin.\nUnlike the Way,\nthey do not differ and do not conspire against each other.\nThus, level land levels Water and Earth,\nand it is known that Water dwells in good land.",

heart is the **Dao/Way**.\nThe **Dao/Way** arises from the heart;\nwhen the heart is still, all forms perish—\nthus its depths are boundless,\nunseen and unfathomable.\nYet when the heart stirs and spirit awakens,\nthe **Dao/Way** scatters as things—\nhow could it fully manifest its use?\n\n\"Serene\" means deep—\nalso \"serene\" means void.\nThe heart’s emptiness holds the principle of profound stillness,\nso the deeper it is measured,\nthe farther it extends.\nZhuangzi said: *\"Serene and still.\"*\nDoes this not illuminate Water’s heart?\n\nWhen unmoved, it is clear;\nwhen undisturbed, it is level—\nhere, even eyebrows and mustaches are revealed.\nThe heavy and turbid settle below,\nthe pure and bright rise above—\nall things rest here.\nThese are the meanings of profound stillness.\n\n**Three,** its virtue is to nurture life—\nits excellence is benevolence.\nThose with hearts give without favor;\nthose without hearts distribute evenly—\nWater’s impartiality\nreaches the utmost benevolence.\nWater makes no choice,\nyet virtue flows universally.\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Kàn has sincerity—its heart is flourishing.\"*\nWith one *yang* dwelling between two *yin*,\nif one cannot cultivate virtue and refine conduct\nto depart from peril,\nhow could one show unceasing sincerity?\nWhen in Kàn, one *yang* returns—\nreturning to reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth’s heart originates in nurturing life;\nreturning, it ceases.\nReturning and ceasing,\nit turns toward life.\nThe heart of universal love is the sage’s mind.\nWithout embodying the **Dao/Way**,\nbenevolence remains constrained—\nlike a drought’s meager dew,\nhow could it compare to Heaven’s timely rains?\nThus, even Yao and Shun found it laborious\nto broadly bestow and aid the people.\nYet Water’s transformation,\nsharing virtue with the **Dao/Way**,\nis universally loving, impartial,\nand gives without choice—\nwhat could it not encompass?\nThus it is said: *\"Its excellence is benevolence.\"*\n\n**Four,** it has a central master—\nspeaking of faithfulness.\nRoots and stems are the origin of things;\nnature and life are what the **Dao/Way** generates.\nTracing its source,\nfollowing its inherent nature,\nit does not deviate from principle.\nThe Five Phases attribute wisdom to Water,\nfaithfulness to Earth.\nHow does Water speak of faithfulness?\nObserve *Fù*—seven days return,\n*qi* transmits to *Zhōngfú* (faithfulness).\nKàn in *Fù* obtains *Zhōngfú* naturally—\nthis is why it is said to master faithfulness.\nThe *Tai Xuan* states:\nOne *yang* rides upon unity,\nall things draw form from the center—\nWater embodies *Zhōngfú*,\nthe central *yang qi* subtly illuminates the Yellow Palace—\nfaithfulness is never absent from the center.\nTruly, the primal spirit’s subtlety lies in one *qi*,\nthe origin of myriad threads begins with wisdom—\nthe source of faithfulness obtains wisdom,\nunifying speech and wisdom, action and faithfulness,\nwithout losing harmony with things.\nWisdom does not inherently master faithfulness—\nin affairs, hesitation breeds regret;\nfaithfulness is not wisdom in action—\nin nature, it stagnates and falters.\nThus, the essence resides within,\nmanifestation lies without—\nultimate speech transcends speech,\ngreat faithfulness requires no oaths,\nso beginning and end are trustworthy,\nnot hollow and empty,\nyet vast in reception.\nThus, it is known:\nIf one speaks without faithfulness in action,\none loses its root.\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Moving through peril without losing faithfulness\"—\nthis is the reason.\n\n**Five,** it follows principle in action—\ngovernance excels in order.\nThe Great **Dao/Way** takes rationality as master;\ngovernance precedes literature.\nSince Heaven and Earth came to be,\nno ruler over all things\nhas failed to exhaust principle and nature\nyet still transformed the people.\nThe Three Sovereigns governed through spiritual transformation of the **Dao/Way**,\nthe Five Emperors ruled with benevolence aligned with Heaven—\nand the world spoke of governance.\nYet who knows its root is as yielding as Water,\nencountering nothing yet achieving transformation?\nThose who arrogantly establish their own virtue\nand disrupt the Great Constant\nsimply do not know the foundation of governance—\nhow could they avoid hardship and scarcity?\nWater’s nature seeks lowliness and moisture,\nflows through the earth,\nbends a thousand times yet flows east,\navoids obstacles and reaches the sea—\nthis is Water’s principle.\nGovernance’s foundation in human nature\nis like irrigation and cultivation—\nmovement and growth depend on it for life;\nlike rain and dew,\nwithering things rely on it for nourishment—\nthis is Water’s function.\nGovernance’s origin in sustaining life\nis like cleansing filth and replacing it with purity,\nreceiving all impurities and replacing them with clarity—\nthis is Water’s virtue.\nGovernance’s excellence in guiding customs\nis like dikes that can be extended,\nyet rivers cannot be violated,\nbarriers that can be built,\nyet torrents cannot be resisted—\nthis is Water’s power.\nGovernance conquers the world with yielding **Dao/Way**,\nlike springs flowing ceaselessly,\ntheir currents vast and boundless—\nthe more drawn, the clearer,\nthe more issued, the fresher—\nthis is Water’s root.\nGovernance renews the world daily,\nlike Water’s inherent qualities—\nall these it possesses,\nthus its excellence in governance is clear.\nAh!\nNothing but Water.\nWaves surge yet are not evil,\nstillness is profound yet not beautiful—\nthough turbulent, it never loses its goodness;\npurified, it is not stagnant;\nstirred, it is not reckless;\nraging, it never loses its longevity.\nThe Supreme Good says: *\"The highest excellence is like Water.\"*\nThe sage embodies this for governance—\nis this not universal wisdom?\n\n**Six,** it adapts to the vessel’s round or square—\naffairs excel in

Dao**,\nconform to what is fitting,\nand perpetually maintain **feminine stillness**,\nnever contending with things.\n\nIf things are not contended with,\nhow could there be any ground for blame?\n\nMoreover, *blame* is *resentment*.\nIt is said that in the world,\nonly the one who does not vie\nhas none to resent or blame.\n\n**Xie Tuonan** said:\n*The highest virtue is like water, approaching the Dao.*\n\nThe **Dao of the Great Learning** lies in stopping at the highest virtue.\nThis is called *highest virtue*—\nits utmost is here.\n\n**Mencius** said:\n*Human nature has no unvirtuous aspect,\njust as water has no place but to descend.*\nThe **Classics** state:\n*Only because the rivers and seas can descend\ndo they become rulers over all the valleys.*\nThus, when virtue is likened to water,\nit is taken from its ability to descend.\n\nOnly when a person can descend\ndo all virtues gather to them.\nOnly when water can descend\ndo all streams gather to it.\nTheir tendency is the same.\n\nWater nourishes all things without contending,\nits benefit lies in benefiting others, not itself.\nWhat the multitude abhors—\nlow, vile, sunken places—\nwater delights in, moving naturally,\nwithout choice or preference.\nThus, it approaches the Dao.\nThough this speaks of water,\nits true intent is for the virtuous person.\n\nThe virtuous person dwelling in the highest virtue\nhas no blame.\n\nHigh and low without preference,\nthus dwelling in the highest virtue.\nClear and pure, unshaken,\nthus the heart is virtuous in the depths.\nTake as you will, give as you will,\nthus it is virtuous in kindness.\nIf not level, it resounds,\nthus it is virtuous in truthfulness.\nIt reflects beauty and ugliness,\nthus governance is virtuous in regulation.\nIt bears weight, it floats weight,\nthus affairs are virtuous in capability.\nIts flow is unceasing,\nthus movement is virtuous in timing.\n\nIf benefit is so vast,\nif achievement is so great,\nyet it never contends with things,\nhow could there be blame or resentment?\n\nThough this speaks of water’s virtue,\nit truly speaks of human virtue.\nVirtue is water—\nnone other than the Dao’s abiding presence.\n\nIndeed, it has been discussed:\n*Heaven first generates water,*\n*water is the origin of the Five Phases,*\n*none is more exalted than water.*\nWater flows through the earth,\nnourishing all things—\nnone is greater than water.\nExalted yet not claiming its exaltation,\ngreat yet not possessing its greatness—\nthis is why virtue does not vie,\nand why, not vying, there is no blame.\n\nThe virtuous person’s virtue,\nif they befriend the virtue of one village, still consider it insufficient,\nif they befriend the virtue of one nation, still consider it insufficient,\nyet if they befriend the virtue of the world,\nthen they may attain the highest virtue.\n\nYet, the highest virtue is fitting to share with others,\njust as rivers and streams do not boast of the world,\nflowing together with the muddy—\nnot proud, not boastful—\nand the world has none to contend with them.\nThus, human virtue is water’s virtue.\n\nWater’s virtue is the Dao’s virtue.\nThe Dao

water?\n\n**Lin Yongzhai** said:\n*The highest virtue is like water, approaching the Dao.*\nThis chapter again uses water to illustrate the thought of having no self.\nThe highest virtue is the utmost virtue.\nIt is said that the world’s highest virtue\nis the same as water’s nature.\n\nWater’s virtue can benefit all things,\nyet when has it ever considered itself capable?\nFollowing the flow without opposing—\nthis is not vying.\nDescending to low places, embracing dampness—\nit does not regard what the world abhors as abhorrent.\nThus, observing water,\none comes near to the Dao.\n\n*Approaching* means *near*.\nDwelling in the highest virtue—\nit speaks of dwelling there and finding peace.\nThe heart is virtuous in the depths—\nit speaks of its steadfastness and tranquility.\nKindness extends to all—\nit speaks of its kindness reaching everywhere.\nTruthfulness in speech—\nit speaks of words always aligning with reality.\nGovernance is virtuous in regulation—\nusing it to govern the state,\nthe state will surely be well-ordered.\nAffairs are virtuous in capability—\nusing it to handle affairs,\nthere will be nothing it cannot accomplish.\nMovement aligns with timing—\nit moves as circumstances dictate,\nalways finding the proper moment.\n\nThese seven lines speak of those with the Dao,\nwhose words are such,\nyet they do not consider themselves capable,\nthus in the world\nthey vie with none,\nand none resent or blame them.\nThis is the meaning of:\n*You alone do not vie,*\n*thus the world has none to vie with you.*\n\nThose who understand well\noften mistake this as the *seven lesser virtues of water*,\nthus their interpretations are strained and forced,\nnot the original intent of **Laozi**.\n\n**Fan Yingyuan** said:\n*The highest virtue is like water, approaching the Dao.*\n*Approaching* means *near*.\nWater, as a thing,\nreceives the **Heavenly One’s qi**,\nhas no fixed form yet permeates

grains—\nit does not flow unless released,\nit does not advance until its basin is full.\nIf the land grows slightly steep, there is no talk of backflow or reversal;\nif the land rises slightly, there is the meaning of unceasing streams.\nOnly in level, stable places does it rest—\nthus it is said to reside in virtuous places.\n\n**The heart is virtuous in depth.**\nThe heart refers to water’s core.\nLike the depths of rivers and seas—\nvast and boundless,\nstirred yet never turbid,\nsettled yet ever clearer—\nit can contain all rivers,\ncarrying everything without discrimination,\nreflecting forms without bias—\nthus it is said the heart is virtuous in depth.\n\n**Generosity is virtuous in kindness.**\nKindness means unceasing life-giving.\nWater’s virtue flows ceaselessly, transforming without end,\nspreading across the land, bearing forms,\nfloating beneath the sky, bathing in the sun—\nits use is unrestricted, its benefit inexhaustible.\nIts virtue matches the Heaven-Earth’s unceasing life-giving mechanism—\nthus it is said generosity is virtuous in kindness.\n\n**Speech is virtuous in trustworthiness.**\nIts meaning is that water’s virtue is sincere without constraint—\nas the ancients praised: *\"Great trustworthiness requires no oaths.\"*\nObserve its function:\nEast Sea departs, West Sea arrives,\ncycling endlessly without fail—\nlike

even the unyielding—\nthus it is said governance is virtuous in order.\n\n**Action is virtuous in capability.**\nWater’s use is soft yet strong,\nweak yet powerful—\nnourishing all life,\nmoistening the Nine Realms,\ncirculating through Heaven and Earth,\npiercing firmness and hardness,\nturning land into depths,\nboring through cliffs and stone,\nleveling heights to lows,\ndiscarding filth while preserving clarity—\nHeaven and Earth rely on its transformative function,\ncreatures and plants benefit from its sustenance—\nthus it is said action is virtuous in capability.\n\n**Movement is virtuous in timing.**\nWater’s function is ever-flowing, ever-moving.\nThe ancients said: *\"Flowing water does not rot\"—\nhow could it not be virtuous?*\nThe Classics state: *\"Nothing under heaven is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing surpasses it in overcoming firmness.\"*\nIts operation cannot be altered—\nlike tidal seas arriving only at their appointed time,\nlike human reliance on water and fire moving only when needed—\nthus it is said movement is virtuous in timing.\n\n**Only the non-contending has no regrets.**\n*Only*—a particle of emphasis.\n*Regrets*—remorse and grudges.\nThis speaks of water’s virtue not contending with things,\nthus having no remorse or grudges.\nOnce, Zigong asked: *\"Why does a gentleman observe great waters?\"*\nConfucius replied: *\"Great waters resemble virtue, resemble the Dao,\nresemble courage yet seem timid,\nresemble rectitude yet seem discerning,\nresemble resolve yet seem benevolent in transformation.\"*\nWater’s virtue is such—\nthus a gentleman must observe it.\nFrom this, how could there be regrets or grudges?\nYang Zhiren said: *\"The utmost goodness is like water—thus no regrets.\"*\nIt means the Dao-holding sage’s nature is like water:\nkind to the people, beneficial to all things,\nperturbed yet not defiled, clarified yet not artificially pure,\nnaturally descending while disdaining elevation—\nwhen poured into a square vessel, it becomes square;\nwhen poured into a round vessel, it becomes round.\nRivers and streams grow long because of this,\nthe Five Phases stand firm because of this.\n*The Book of Transformation* says:\n*\"Water’s hollows can drown one—\nthus it approaches the Dao.\"*\nIt nourishes all things, resides in virtuous places.\nDeep and luminous, the heart is virtuous in depth.\nAll things gain life from water—\ngenerosity is virtuous in kindness.\nIt reflects forms without losing their essence—\nspeech is virtuous in trustworthiness.\nClear and smooth, governance is virtuous in order.\nIt can be square or round, curved or straight—\naction is virtuous in capability.\nIt melts in summer and congeals in winter—\nmovement is virtuous in timing.\nOnly the non-contending—\nits Dao is profound.\nThus there are no regrets.\n\nMencius said: *\"Human nature’s goodness is like water’s tendency to descend.\nNo one is without goodness, just as water is without fail descending.\"*\nYu Qingzhong said: *\"The utmost goodness is like water—thus no regrets.\"*\nWater is called *\"moistening the low\"*—\ndwelling in the most humble, damp places,\nwhich all people despise.\nWater is an emotionless thing—\nnothing under heaven is as level as water.\nThe truly virtuous person resembles it.\nThe *utmost goodness* refers to those of supreme virtue and perfection.\nAccording to old teachings, water embodies three near-Dao abilities and seven virtues beneficial to things.\nWhat are the three abilities?\nWater’s nature is tranquil and disperses to nourish all—\nHeaven without water would be parched,\nEarth without water would wither—\nbenefiting all things—\nthis is the first ability.\nNothing under heaven is softer or weaker than water—\nit abandons solidity for emptiness,\nrejects height for lowliness—\nblocked, it stops;\nreleased, it flows;\nsubmitting to human command—\nthis is the second ability.\nThough people dislike dwelling in low places,\nwater seeks the low and damp,\nmaking things pure while receiving filth—\nthis is the third ability.\n*Near*—meaning *close*.\nHeaven generates water—*one*—the Dao.\nThe Dao’s *one* is the non-dual *one*,\nwater’s *one* is the dual *one*.\nThe non-dual *one* is the Dao’s essence,\nthe dual *one* is the Dao’s function—\nthus it is said to approach the Dao.\n\nWhat are the seven virtues?\nThe sage’s dwelling is virtuous in humility,\nfollowing things naturally,\ntransforming even the neighborhood—\nlike water on the earth,\nvirtuous in descending to low places,\nnourishing all things.",

      "translated_text": "「Comparative Analysis: Master He Shang composed *The Chapter of the Wandering Yi* (《运夷章》), while Zhao Shixian wrote *The Chapter of Observing Retreat as Advancement* (《观退为进义章》).\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang explained: The previous chapter elucidates the virtuous conduct of the sage—gentle and yielding, hence free from blame. This chapter clarifies how the common folk, drowned in desires and arrogant with excess, inevitably incur fault.\n\nIt begins with the admonition **\"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt\"** (持而盈之, 不如其已。 揣而锐之, 不可长保), showing how such states are hard to preserve. Next, it warns of gold and jade, wealth and honor, cautioning against greed. It concludes with **\"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw\"** (功成名遂身退), urging one to forget merit and avoid harm.\n\nMaster Du Guangting remarked: The previous chapter used water as an analogy to illustrate the Way of cultivation. Here, with **\"Hold and it will overflow\"**** as its opening, it further reveals the folly of greed and stagnation, urging one to forget merit and retreat, thus aligning with the sage’s perfection.\n\nZhang Chongying stated: *Yi* refers to the boundless void of the cosmos—clear and luminous yet without form or color—unfathomable by humans. Though human affairs may flow like that void, if one prevents others from perceiving them, it is akin to concealing one’s spirit and avoiding self-harm.\n\n**\"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt\"** (持而盈之, 不如其已。 揣而锐之, 不可长保).\n**\"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them\"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).\n**\"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame\"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).\n**\"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven\"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).\n\nComparative Analysis: Yan Zun, Yang Fu, and Wang Bi all concurred with the ancient text.\n\nMaster He Shang said: **\"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt\"** (持而盈之, 不如其已).\n*Sweng*, meaning \"full,\" *ji*, meaning \"stop.\"\nTo hold what is full is to risk collapse—better to stop.\n\n**\"Grasp and it will blunt\"** (揣而锐之, 不可长保).\n*Chuai*, meaning \"to refine.\"\nAfter refinement, it must be discarded—its sharpness cannot endure.\n\n**\"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them\"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).\nLustful desires harm the spirit, riches burden the body.\n\n**\"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame\"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).\nIf one is wealthy, they should relieve the poor; if noble, they should pity the lowly. Yet if they instead grow arrogant, calamity will surely befall them.\n\n**\"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven\"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).\nIt means that when a person’s deeds are accomplished and their reputation secured, if they do not retreat and relinquish their prominence, they will meet misfortune. This is Heaven’s constant Way.\n\nAs the sun reaches its zenith and begins to decline, the moon wanes after fullness, things flourish only to decay, and joy reaches its peak before sorrow follows.\n\nWang Fu’s commentary: **\"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt\"** (持而盈之, 不如其已).\n*Chi* means \"to hold without losing virtue,\" but if one holds virtue while also filling oneself with excess, collapse is inevitable. Thus, it is better to stop—meaning to be even worse than having no virtue or merit at all.\n\n**\"Grasp and it will blunt\"** (揣而锐之, 不可长保).\nIf one refines and sharpens it further after already making it sharp, its force will only be exhausted and ruined—thus it cannot be long preserved.\n\n**\"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them\"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).\nIt is better to stop.\n\n**\"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame\"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).\nIt cannot be long preserved.\n\n**\"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven\"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).\nThe seasons cycle in turn, and when merit is fulfilled, one must withdraw.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong remarked: **\"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt\"** (持而盈之, 不如其已).\nTo grasp and fill with excess, lest it topple—if one accumulates, it becomes a burden, and regret will arise. Hence, it is better to stop.\n*Ji*, meaning \"to stop.\"\n\nExplanation: *Chi* means \"to grasp,\" *sweng* means \"full,\" *ji* means \"to stop.\"\nIt speaks of how human hearts, greedy and insatiable, grasp and hoard, filling themselves with wealth. Accumulation brings burdens, and regret will inevitably follow. Thus, the sage warns: It is better to cease.\n\n**\"Grasp and it will blunt\"** (揣而锐之, 不可长保).\n*Chuai* means \"to measure or refine,\" *rui* means \"sharp and keen.\"\nTo refine and sharpen desires for fame and honor, to cling to power and rely on wealth—if one accumulates to fullness, arrogance will arise, and ruin will follow. Thus, it cannot be long preserved.\n\nExplanation: *Chuai* means \"to measure or assess,\" *rui* means \"sharp and keen.\"\nAll who are mired in desires, greedy for fame and gain, assess past deeds and sharpen their ambition, provoking resentment and inviting ruin. Hence, it cannot be long preserved.\n\n**\"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them\"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).\nThis illustrates how excess is difficult to sustain.\n\nExplanation: Suppose one’s greed knows no bounds, filling their halls with gold and jade. Even elephants are tamed by fire, and roosters mutilated for ritual propriety. Yet, by losing the treasure of non-greed, one invites the anxiety of bandits. With such harm, how can they be guarded? This reverses the meaning of **\"Hold and it will overflow.\"**\n\n**\"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame\"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).\nThis reveals how sharpness cannot be grasped—arrogance stems from the heart, so blame is not from another.\n\nExplanation: Wealth attracts envy, so one easily oppresses others. Honor demands deference, so one readily domineers over others. Arrogance and excess arise without warning; calamity follows without cause. Regret comes from arrogance itself, born of the heart. Hence, it is said: one invites blame upon themselves. This reverses the meaning of **\"Grasp and it will blunt.\"**\n\n**\"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven\"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).\nThose whose achievements are complete and reputation secured should retreat and avoid excess—just as Heaven’s Way follows the cycles of fullness and emptiness. Thus, there will be no misfortune.\n\nExplanation: This is an admonition. Fullness invites loss, while humility brings benefit. Even Heaven does not remain perpetually full, so those who achieve will be humbled, and those who gain fame will suffer decline. To seek long preservation is unheard of. One must instead forget merit and fame, retreat, and relinquish excess—like Heaven’s Way. Only by not defying the cycles of fullness and emptiness can one avoid calamity and censure.\n\nMaster Du Guangting said: The analogy of **\"Hold and it will overflow\"**** encompasses four meanings.\nOne: Clinging to desires until they reach fullness.\nTwo: Hoarding worldly wealth until it overflows.\nThree: Persisting in evil deeds until they swell.\nFour: Grasping authority and relying on office until they become excessive.\n\nIn general, those who know only advancement and forget retreat, who do not reflect on the Dao of virtue, who cling stubbornly without turning back—all such as reach fullness will meet retribution. Those whose desires overflow will suffer from feebleness and illness, harming their lives. Those whose worldly wealth overflows will face plunder and loss.",

I am perplexed by this.\nI have heard that those who govern states must fear not the lack of wealth, but the difficulty of earning a virtuous name.\nWhen wealth accumulates in the lord’s halls, the states grow disloyal.\nIf you rely on it, Jin will become disloyal.\nWhen the states are disloyal, Jin will collapse; when Jin collapses, your house will fall.\nWhy would you court such ruin?\nWealth is but a vehicle for virtue, and virtue is the foundation of a state.\nWith a foundation, there is no collapse—why not strive for this?\nVirtue brings joy, and joy ensures longevity.

All were harmed by their sharpness—how could one not take heed?\n\n**Three: What is not innate cannot be firmly held.**\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.\nThose skilled in seeking the Dao seek within themselves; those skilled in preserving virtue secure what they attain.\nWithout seeking the Dao, there is no foundation for virtue; without establishing virtue, there is no way to manifest the Dao.\nIf one is unsettled here, if one is hasty here, then external things cannot be allowed to enter.\nOnce virtue and the Dao are lost, what one preserves lies outside—grand halls with carved beams and ornate walls, towering eaves and sculpted partitions—unless filled with gold and jade, they cannot be said to be truly refined.\nGold and jade are the essence of pure yang, treasured by the world.\nThose who gain these and consider themselves rich do not follow a lasting path.\nThey can only moisten their homes but not nourish their bodies; they can invite thieves but cannot ensure blessings. Thus, greed for gain becomes a fatal malady, and the pursuit of wealth leads to reckless excess.\nWhat need is there for such transient fortune?\n\n**Four: The virtuous person guards against arrogance.**\nRich and noble yet proud, one invites disaster upon oneself.\nThe *Hong Fan* [《洪范》] lists five blessings: first, longevity; second, wealth—but it never mentions nobility.\nFor wealth can bring nobility, yet nobility does not necessarily bring wealth.\nZhuangzi said: *\"Great wealth brings the nation’s treasures; great nobility brings the nation’s honors.\"*\nIf one can attain wealth, nobility will follow.\nYet even a son of a thousand pieces of gold sits without arrogance—though one may wish not to be proud, how can it be avoided?\nPower compels it thus.\nBut if one, in wealth and nobility, precedes it with propriety, applies it with benevolence, and acts with righteousness, then even wealth and nobility cannot burden virtue.\nThere are those of noble character who surpass this—arrogance harms virtue.\nThose who harm virtue, can they escape misfortune?\nZigong asked: *\"Poor yet without flattery, rich yet without arrogance—how is that?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"That is acceptable.\nBut it is not as good as being poor yet joyful, or rich yet fond of ritual.\"*\n\nThose like the **Fan family**, who suffered humiliation at the hands of **Qiu Kai** [丘开], yet ultimately brought ruin upon themselves, or the **Yu family**, who were injured by a crossbow bolt meant for an assassin because of a rotting rat—these were all those who bore the look of arrogance.\nThus, the later generations withdrew their caution:\n**One: Great names do not endure.**\nWhen achievement is complete and reputation is fulfilled,\nthe Sage, in all matters, thinks deeply.\nWhen holding great things and fearing excess, one fears them as if they were nothing—yet still does not guard against them.\nThus, holding to excess is not as good as ceasing.\nEase is simple; action is difficult.\nAction cannot avoid premeditation, and where premeditation arises, how can one remain unchallenged?\nIf challenged, one seeks victory; if victorious, the other is defeated.\nTo measure and sharpen—is this not a strategy for long preservation?\nTo hold gold and jade without burdening the heart, to dwell in wealth and nobility without arrogance toward others—these are what people find difficult.\nTo have is not as good as to not have; to act is not as good as to cease.\n\n**Two: Align with Heaven and act accordingly.**\nRetreat is the Way of Heaven.\nAt the decline of the sun, without drumming or singing, the aged sigh at misfortune—those who follow Heaven’s path, having achieved their purpose and fulfilled their name, withdraw in retreat.\nThey say, *\"How could this burden me?\"*\n**Shao Ruo** [邵若愚] said: *\"Holding to excess until one retreats is the Way of Heaven.*\nTo dwell in high status and thick profit is like holding a vessel full to the brim—always fearing it will topple, it is better to cease before it overflows.\nThus, the unfilled is easier to hold.\nTo measure and sharpen is to invite ruin.\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.\nWealth and nobility breed arrogance; arrogance and negligence lead to excess—this is not Heaven’s punishment, but self-inflicted ruin.\nYet how does one avoid this calamity?\nThus, the Sage observes the cycles of the four seasons: like spring’s transformation, when achievement is complete and reputation fulfilled, by summer one retreats and does not remain—this is the Way of Heaven.\n**Wang Zhi Ran** [王志然] said: *\"Holding to excess until one retreats is the Way of Heaven.*\nWhat is beyond form is called the Dao; what is within form is called the vessel.\nWithin the realm of vessels, if there is fullness, there must be emptiness; if there is abundance, there must be decline.\nTo hold and guard, one must always fear self-excess—self-excess inevitably brings the disaster of collapse.\nThus, the ancients acted before harm arose and governed before disorder set in, vigilant and cautious, fearing only the loss of the means to reflect and amend.\nThe four cardinal virtues—ritual, righteousness, propriety, and shame—are the constants.\nThey dwell in substance, not in ornament; they always occupy the thick, never the thin.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*The Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and benefits humility;\nThe Dao of Earth transforms excess and flows toward humility;\nGhosts and spirits harm excess and bless humility;\nHuman nature abhors excess and loves humility.*\nHow perfect is humility as virtue!\nIts root lies here; its branches lie there.\nHolding to ancient ways, the Sage has never failed to value humility.\nIts ultimate principle warns against overflow—\nwhat is called *holding to excess is not as good as ceasing.*\nThus, holding excess is not as good as preserving humility;\nmeasuring and sharpening is not as good as blunting sharpness.\nTo measure is to gauge others’ intentions;\nto sharpen is to exploit others’ weaknesses.\nSharpness cannot be beneficial; benefit does not harm others.\nAs Mencius said: *\"The archer fears injuring others; the crossbowman fears not injuring others.\"*\nThis is what should be blunted, not sharpened.\nIf one advances with sharpness, one’s retreat will be swift—\nhow could this endure?\nThis is its meaning.\nExternal things cannot be relied upon—\npeople may claim them as their own, yet the Sage withdraws and avoids them.\nMoreover, wealth and nobility are what people desire,\ngold and jade are what people value—\nif one knows how to accumulate but not how to disperse,\nknows how to take but not how to give,\nthen one is no different from a great thief hoarding treasures.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Thus there are those who cling to their selfish private gains, insatiable even unto death, neglecting the cultivation of the fundamental Dao of life and death, and instead harming themselves—many perish without realizing it. How utterly foolish they are.\n\nLaozi specifically warns: *\"The more one loves, the greater the cost; the more one hoards, the heavier the loss.\"* Hence, those who understand the Dao recognize that wealth and nobility are ultimately insufficient to preserve one’s life. They do not cling to the transient advantages of a single lifetime for their own private gain, nor do they seek to dominate the world for the sake of display. When wealth accumulates to the point of overflowing the nation’s treasury, when nobility reaches the stage where titles and honors are bestowed upon all, when the distinctions between heaven and earth are blurred and great and small alike are governed by this principle—yet their own person remains untainted by wealth or nobility, their heart tranquil, never slighting even a single thing in their breast, though gold and jade fill their halls, they never grow arrogant or stingy. Their actions align with auspicious fortune, so what blame could there be?\n\nThe affliction of possessing a body is indeed grave. Yet, if one examines and reflects with care, what is truly valued is the absence of blame. When blame is absent, then where do misfortune, regret, and stinginess arise from?\n\nTo know how to advance yet not know how to retreat, to know how to preserve yet not know how to lose, to know how to gain yet not know how to suffer—how could one avoid regret?\n\nIf one achieves fame and success, yet grows proud and self-satisfied, boasting and flaunting, who in the world would not vie to contest their achievements?\n\nThe *Yijing* states: *\"To know how to advance and retreat, preserve and lose, without losing one’s true course—is this not the unique attribute of the Sage?\"*\n\nThe august Heaven has no partiality, only virtue does it assist. The yin and yang of heaven and earth create and transform all things; the four seasons proceed in their order, and the year’s harvest is fulfilled. When the harvest is complete, the season departs—Heaven says nothing of it.\n\nIf humans can embody this, they will harmonize with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with the sun and moon in luminosity, with the four seasons in order, and with the spirits and gods in fortune and misfortune. Heaven will not oppose them, and what of humans?\n\nThus the classics say: *\"When achievements are complete, fame is secured, and one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven.\"* Students of the Way, how could they dare not strive to emulate this?\n\nHuang Maocai remarks: *\"To cling and fill to the utmost is impossible to sustain long.\"* The Dao is without attachment, yet one seeks to make it void. To cling and fill, is this possible? The Dao is without fixed form, yet one seeks to make it rigid. To measure and sharpen, is this possible? All these are rooted in *non*-Dao. Non-Dao is early decay; how could it endure?\n\nEven when gold and jade fill one’s halls, it leads to self-inflicted blame. Gold and jade, as in the saying *\"clad in coarse hemp yet holding jade in one’s bosom,\"* are not of this world’s material wealth. Wealth and nobility, as in the saying *\"those who know me are few, hence I am noble,\"* are not of this world’s transient riches. The ancients had inner attainments; worldly affairs could not perturb their hearts. They valued the inner over the outer, prized themselves above external things.\n\nYet when it comes to arrogance, the disciples of Jian Kang in the Jin Dynasty indulged in lofty discourse, extolling profound mysteries, not without some grasp of the Dao. But by trampling others and scornful of the world, they ultimately met disaster. It is fitting that Laozi warned against this.\n\n*\"When achievements are complete, fame is secured, and one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven.\"* Achievement here means *\"achievement without attachment,\"* not the world’s so-called achievements. Fame here means *\"fame without self-aggrandizement,\"* not the world’s so-called fame. When achievements are complete and fame is secured, yet one withdraws—observing the sequence of the four seasons reveals the Dao of Heaven.\n\nLaozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi, Fan Li, the Four Worthies, Anqi Sheng, and Dongfang Shuo were Sages of the ancient times. Yet the histories do not record their final fate—is this not because the Dao was fulfilled and they withdrew, leaving no trace for mortals to know?\n\nCheng Tai remarked: *\"It is better not to cling and fill at all.\"* Fame, success, wealth, and nobility—when one reaches their utmost measure, this is called *\"filling.\"* Above the point of filling, there is only collapse and overflow. Why strain anxiously to cling and hold, pushing toward the extreme, when it would be better to extinguish such thoughts and leave room for natural overflow? Hence the saying: *\"It is better not to cling and fill at all.\"*\n\nTo measure and sharpen cannot be sustained long. If one fixates on the idea that *\"offices and emoluments are insufficient to fill,\"* then in one’s pursuits, the fear is of ever becoming dull. Thus, one preemptively gauges and calculates; when opportunity is seen, one acts with sharp precision. Those who follow such schemes may indeed succeed. Yet the measuring is in oneself, while the opportunity lies with others; guessing and often hitting the mark is mere luck. Even if one often succeeds by luck, there remain instances where luck fails, and this is the rigid insistence on what cannot be guaranteed. How could one expect such fleeting luck to become a constant? Hence, *\"it cannot be sustained long.\"*\n\nWhen gold and jade fill one’s halls, yet one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven. If wealth is gathered yet cannot be preserved, those who possess it grow proud with their abundance, and pride leads to ruin. Recognizing the cycle of filling and emptying, abandoning fame and success without clinging to them, this is to walk with Heaven. Without pride, one cannot speak of it.\n\nDiscussing the movement of the four seasons, the accomplished withdraw. This is precisely what Laozi meant by the Dao of Heaven. Yet the world hears it as if not hearing. They see the possibility of dwelling in success, yet fail to grasp the true principle of void and fullness.\n\nQijingshuai, the Duke of Qi, lamented the wealth of his state, considering death a tragedy. Yanzi laughed at him: *\"If the ancients never died, then Taigong and Wenzi would always guard it. Would you, my lord, wear a patched robe and till the fields, with no time to ponder death?\"* For they take turns in their roles, take turns in departing, and yet return to the lord. Yet you alone weep—is this not unkind?\n\nIn saying this, he was pointing out the alternating cycles of the four seasons, the successive phases of filling and emptying, and their relation to life and death, gain and loss. Hence, Liezi expounded on the mutual urging of life and transformation, saying: *\"The living cannot avoid living; the transforming cannot avoid transforming.\"* He also spoke of the opposing balance of excess and deficiency: *\"What is lost to one is gained by another; what is gained here is lost there.\"*\n\nThe transforming cannot avoid transforming, for it is the condition of the living’s inability to remain unborn. If this fullness and completion were not drawn from the other, yet the other must inevitably suffer loss and decay—how then could this fullness and completion be sustained without the other’s loss?",

      "translated_text": "「From this perspective, the alternating cycles of departure and return are precisely the teachings of the Old Master [Laozi]. He spoke of those whose accomplishments are complete and whose reputation is fulfilled, yet whose fate demands they must withdraw.\n\nIndeed, accomplishments and fame are the fruits of a profession brought to fruition. Wealth and honor are the gatherings of rank and emolument. Examining the affairs of the world, the number of ranks and emoluments in one age is fixed. Therefore, those who entrust their profession to others must also remain within this same age. If talented and wise individuals were to constantly monopolize these gains, then those who teach and guide with humility would have no place to welcome them.\n\nThus, when new arrivals come, the already accomplished must retreat—this is the inevitable succession of the four seasons. Hence, the Daoists, regarding the world, initially refuse to lightly accept responsibility for others, and ultimately do not wish to long remain in positions of success.\n\nLike the disciples of Zhang Liang [in his retreat to the Garden of Fine Brocade], they could look down upon the calamities and humiliations of Xiao He and Han Xin with a smile, all having perceived this truth.\n\nBut for those who ascend to become sages, the matter is grander still. They say: *\"To harmonize with the virtue/power of Heaven and Earth, to align with the sequence of the four seasons, advancement and retreat, life and death—all proceed without deviation.\"* This is far beyond those who fear fullness and seek safety, for they cannot be compared.\n\nZhan Qiu Pu said: *\"The Dao of holding while full is to withdraw when Heaven demands.\"* The passage of *Yun Yi Zhang* [《运夷章》] elaborates: *\"Yun\"* means \"use,\" *\"Yi\"* means \"balance.\"* To hold until fullness overflows, to grasp until sharpness is extreme—when gold and jade accumulate to fill the hall, when wealth and honor lead to extravagance and arrogance, these are not the paths of balance. They are the roots of calamity and ruin.\n\nTrue balance lies in the passage of *Yun* alone. Therefore, when accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is complete, one must courageously withdraw. This is in accordance with Heaven’s Dao, which is as such. One cannot know advancement without knowing retreat.\n\nZhang Chong replied: *\"The Dao of holding while full is to withdraw when Heaven demands.\"* Just as the sun reaches its zenith and then declines, the moon attains fullness and then wanes, and torrential rain cannot last an entire day—Heaven’s Dao operates thus, and how much more so for humanity?\n\nHumans understand that Heaven’s Dao abhors excess and advocates humility, tempering sharpness and avoiding overreach. Thus, when fullness accumulates within oneself, one must swiftly consider self-restraint. Yet, if one persists in greed for wealth and position, they will invite harm to their spirit and body, bringing ruin upon themselves.\n\nWhen sharpness is directed toward others, one must quickly reflect on tempering it. If they continue to nurture malevolence and harm others, they will provoke retaliation and endanger themselves. To forget fullness and not know restraint is to let gold and jade fill the halls, only to attract disaster—none can guard against it.\n\nWealth and honor leading to arrogance, while harboring sharpness, will only bring self-inflicted blame.

      "translated_text": "The discussion has been examined: Heaven has the four seasons, and when accomplishments are fulfilled, retreat is called for.\n\nReputation is like the Creator’s stingy bestowal—once achieved and perfected, if one cannot preserve oneself and avoid harm by retiring to leisure, if one is greedy for honor and risks favor, calamity will soon follow.\n\nThis is because one does not understand the principle of *consumption and replenishment*, the Dao of advance and retreat, of flourishing and decline. When *yang* is excessive, regret follows; when *yin* is exhausted, struggle ensues—even the *Heavenly Stem* and *Earthly Branch* cannot escape. How much more so for humanity?\n\nThus, the Yellow Emperor humbled himself before Broad Success’s inquiry, and Zi Zhang followed the wanderings of Chi Song—these are but one Dao.\n\nLin Yongzhai said: *\"To hold and fill to excess until retreat is Heaven’s Way.\"* This chapter speaks only of how advance is not as good as retreat, thus using the metaphor of *holding fullness* and *sharpening to a point*.\n\nA vessel filled to its brim will surely overflow; to hold it is difficult, yet it is easier not to fill it at all. *Already* means \"do not fill to excess.\"\n\n*Describe* (治) means *to govern*; *point* (锐) means *sharpness*. To govern a vessel until it reaches extreme sharpness—nothing can endure without breaking. It is better not to sharpen at all, for then it may endure long.\n\nTo amass wealth until gold and jade fill the hall—one cannot long preserve it. To occupy the rank of a prince and grow arrogant—one will surely invite blame.\n\nThus, those who wish to preserve their accomplishments and safeguard their reputation must know when to retreat, for this is Heaven’s Way. When accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is achieved, it is a matter of their scale—those who can preserve themselves.\n\nHence it is said: *\"fulfilled\"* and *\"achieved.\"* If one does not know when to stop, when is it fulfilled? When is it achieved?\n\nFan Yingyuan said: *\"To hold and fill to excess cannot be long preserved. Fullness leads to overflow; to hold and fortify it is better than not stopping at all. Sharpness leads to fracture; to govern and sharpen it—how can it be long preserved? Gold and jade fill the hall, yet one invites blame by oneself. Greedy for wealth and reckless with life—one loses all while the treasures remain. Rich and noble yet arrogant and extravagant—one loses oneself and brings ruin to one’s descendants.\"*\n\nThe Master of the Riverbank said: *\"When rich, one should rescue the poor; when noble, one should pity the lowly. If instead one grows arrogant and unrestrained, then calamity will follow.\"*\n\nWhen accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is achieved, retreat is Heaven’s Way. The movement of *yin* and *yang* runs its course—when accomplishments are fulfilled, retreat is Heaven’s Way. Humanity should emulate Heaven, so from ancient times to today, those who achieve accomplishments and reputation yet do not retreat are often met with disaster.\n\nThe words of Laozi are a mirror for ten thousand generations. Those like Zi Zhang alone align with Heaven’s Way.\n\nXue Yongzhai said: *\"To hold and fill to excess is not as good as stopping.\"* A vessel filled to its brim will overturn—even if held, it is of no use. It is better to cease what is held and keep it balanced and upright.\n\nTo govern and sharpen to a point cannot be long preserved. A person’s sharp edges, even without grinding, will surely be injured in motion—though governed, they cannot be preserved.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them. Shi Chong, standing in the marketplace, said: *\"My slaves profit from my wealth alone; none can guard it.\"*\n\nRich and noble yet arrogant—one invites blame by oneself. Han Xin, though wise in his many warnings, still demonstrated his power to King Qi, thus inviting the calamity of Yunmeng.\n\nGuo Zhen, after twenty-four promotions to Chancellor, enjoyed wealth, nobility, longevity, and honor from beginning to end—what more could a subject achieve? What blame could there be?\n\nWhen accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is achieved, retreat is Heaven’s Way. Fan Li and Zi Zhang certainly knew this Dao. Did the Grandee Zhen and Li Si understand it?\n\nXiu Xiu An said: *\"To hold and fill to excess until retreat is Heaven’s Way.\"* The wise do not govern fullness or sharpen to a point. Those who guard and wait for satisfaction should know that fullness brings loss—it is better to stop early. Those who govern and sharpen to a point know that sharpness brings fracture—it cannot be long preserved.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them. Time is limited, fleeting and swift; human wealth and nobility are but dreams. Some, when in wealth and nobility, should deeply reflect and awaken, seizing the time to cultivate the Dao and virtue, entering sainthood and transcending humanity. If one is ignorant, indulgent, and extravagant, blind to the Way, one invites blame by oneself.\n\nThose who achieve accomplishments and reputation should early preserve themselves and retreat, gathering results from causes, thus aligning with Heaven’s Way. Those who followed Chi Song’s wanderings—like Zhang Liang.\n\nZhu Bo Xiu said: *\"To hold and fill to excess until retreat is Heaven’s Way.\"* To hold things until they are full is to metaphorically speak of insatiable ambition, thus warning against not stopping. And not to govern and sharpen to a point—to avoid competing for gain and risking harm—thus declaring it cannot be long preserved.\n\nThose who rush in pursuit of gain, reckless in their ambitions, until gold and jade fill the hall—will they not tread the path of *\"wealth without virtue\"*? Those who long dwell in wealth and nobility, without restraint, will grow arrogant and extravagant, corrupting their hearts and ruining their nature. Human and ghostly censure will have no escape—all this begins with excess, with not knowing when to stop.\n\nAccumulating evil and inviting disaster, they end in self-destruction. The affairs of Yi Bu and Jin Gu can serve as a warning. Thus, those who hold should not let things fill to excess—if not filled, there is no need to hold.\n\nThe foolish know this yet take no heed, sweetly stepping into disaster. The gentleman, in this regard, weighs the heavy and light, acting with advance and retreat—not abandoning accomplishments and reputation, but clearly discerning Heaven’s principles of rise and fall, examining human affairs for what is permissible and what is not. Knowing that fulfilled accomplishments and achieved reputation have things to fear, they retreat and conceal themselves to nurture their virtue.\n\nThus, they see the honor of Heaven’s bestowal. Looking back on worldly gains and offices, they find them unworthy of pursuit.\n\nThe cycles of the four seasons run their course—when accomplishments are fulfilled, retreat is called for. If one defies this principle, one disrupts Heaven’s order—how much more so for human affairs?\n\nObserving the ancient and modern heroes, few preserve their later years—worthy of sighs. Only those who perceive omens and know contentment can avoid misfortune in life and leave a fragrant name behind.\n\nThe sages have said: *\"Without the strength to lift mountains or move tides, how could one turn back to see the cold place?\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Truly so. The *Niu Miao* transmission states: *\"To hold and fill is not as good as to know when to stop.\"* By *hold*, it means *admonition*—when what one holds becomes full, it must overflow. Thus, it is seen that it is better to stop before reaching fullness than to hold until overflowing.\n\nTo dwell in *zhongyong* (the balanced middle) is to naturally avoid overflowing. Hence it is said: *\"To know when to stop is better than to hold until full.\"*\n\nIn ancient times, Confucius observed in the temple of Duke Huan of Lu a tilted vessel, and asked its keeper: *\"What is this vessel?\"* The keeper replied: *\"It is called the *yòu* (tolerant) seat vessel.\"* Confucius said: *\"I have heard that the *yòu* seat vessel—when empty, it commands respect; when half-full, it stands upright; when full, it overturns. The ancient wise rulers considered this the ultimate admonition—is this not the meaning of 'to know when to stop is better than to hold until full'?\"*\n\nTo probe and sharpen is not long-lasting. By *probe*, it means *test*; by *sharpen*, it means *unyielding strength*. When one is tested and found to be unyielding, it is certain that they lack *ren* (benevolence). Confucius declared: *\"The unbenevolent cannot long endure adversity, nor can they long dwell in pleasure.\"* This is the same principle.\n\nThe ancients said: *\"To associate with a virtuous person is like walking through mist and dew—though one may not be drenched, there is constant refreshment;\nTo dwell among the wicked is like standing between blades—though one may not be harmed, there is constant peril.*\nMoreover, if one’s attire and bearing are not proper, others may already be inclined to dismiss them—how much more so for the unyielding, whose association cannot be long preserved?\n\nMencius said: *\"When Shun ruled the world, he selected from the masses and raised Gao Yao—then the unbenevolent were distant indeed.\nWhen Tang ruled the world, he selected from the masses and raised Yi Yin—then the unbenevolent were distant indeed.*\nIt is because the unbenevolent know they cannot long endure association. Hence it is said: *\"To probe and sharpen is not long-lasting.\"*\n\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them. Gold and jade are the world’s most precious treasures—though they fill the chamber, they are inherently valued by others, and what benefit do they bring to one’s *shìgōng* (worldly accomplishments)? This is the meaning of *\"none can guard them.\"*\n\nThe *Tàishàng* (Supreme Sage) said: *\"Wealth and honor cannot accompany one at death—when the Five Heavenly Messengers (*Wúcháng Shǐzhě*, the agents of fate) strike without warning, seizing the soul, the grand halls and lofty chambers are no longer inhabited, nor can one follow the swift chariots and fine steeds into the afterlife. Gold and jade, jewels and treasures, are but playthings for others—this is the meaning of 'none can guard them.'*\nWealth and honor bring arrogance, which invites one’s own downfall. Wealth and honor are *zūnróng* (eminence and grace); arrogance is *àomàn* (haughtiness and insolence). *Héi* (to invite) means self-inflicted; *jiù* (blame) means regret and remorse. The ancients said: *\"Does wealth and honor make one arrogant, or does poverty make one arrogant?\"*\nThe proverb states: *\"Wealth and honor do not make one arrogant—if they do, the arrogance comes from within.\"*\nConfucius said: *\"The noble one maintains composure without arrogance; the petty one arrogantly lacks composure.*\nTo fail in dwelling in composure is to invite regret. The *Shū* (Book of Documents) says: *\"Revelry and arrogance lead to ruin—this is to invite disaster oneself.\"*\nDisaster and fortune come from no other source than one’s own actions—this is the meaning of *\"to invite one’s own downfall.\"*\n\nWhen accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation achieved, one must retreat—this is the *Dao* of Heaven. If one stands in the halls of power, their name inscribed on bamboo and silk, they may be said to have fulfilled accomplishments and achieved reputation. Yet if they know to seek retreat, hanging their official cap and refusing further office, this is called *shēntuì* (retiring oneself). Those who retire without overflowing are in accord with Heaven’s *Dao*.\n\nFor instance, Zhang Liang served Emperor Gaozu of Han, ranked among the feudal lords, yet he did not dare accept three thousand households—only saying: *\"A seal and a title are enough.\"* Later, he left office and wandered with the *Chìsōng Zǐ* (Red Pine Immortal). Was this not retiring oneself?\nFan Li served King Goujian of Yue and achieved hegemony, then said: *\"Under a great name, one cannot long remain.\"* He removed his official seal, set sail across the sea, and departed. These two men—fulfilling accomplishments without claiming them, achieving reputation and retiring—embodied the *Dao* of Heaven’s non-overflowing principle, were they not virtuous?\n\nYang Zhiren said: *\"From 'to hold and fill' to 'retiring oneself' is the *Dao* of Heaven. To hold and fill means the sun reaches its peak at nine in the third month, while the moon wanes at two in the eighth month. In *xiūzhēn xuédào* (cultivating true *Dao*), lead and mercury transform into the most precious elixir—when the fire’s *huò* (alchemical potency) is complete and the *qi* is sufficient, one must retreat and not act further. If they fail to know when to stop, great disgrace will follow. Hence, 'to know when to stop is better than to hold until full.'*\nIt is because holding until full leads to overflowing—better to stop before that. Yet if one has not yet reached fullness, there must be greed. To probe and sharpen—how can this be long preserved?\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them. Wealth and honor bring one to retire and conceal—this is to harmonize with Heaven’s *Dao*.\n\nShu Guang said to his son: *\"I have heard that knowing contentment brings no disgrace, knowing when to stop avoids peril. When accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation achieved, this is the way—if one does not leave, fear will come with regret. Yet arrogance and indulgence in desires will surely harm one’s *shénqì* (spirit and *qi*), inviting one’s own downfall.\"*\n\nWhen accomplishments are fulfilled without boasting, and reputation achieved without flaunting, the *Dao* is complete.\n\nQing Zhong said: *\"From 'to hold and fill' to 'retiring oneself' is the *Dao* of Heaven. Fullness invites loss; modesty invites benefit. This is the *Dao* of Heaven, the essence of this chapter’s teaching.*\nA vessel full to the brim will overturn—none hold it better than knowing when to stop.\nA blade too sharp will break—if one further probes and grinds it, it cannot be long preserved.\nUsing objects as metaphors, it is to teach people to know when to advance and when to retreat.\nGold and jade fill the hall—one should stop there. Yet if they greedily seek more, though they possess this gold and jade, none can guard it.\nWealth and honor that permeate the heavens should prompt one to know when to stop. Yet if they further indulge in arrogance and self-indulgence, this is to invite one’s own downfall.»",
      "overlap_context": "run their course—when accomplishments are fulfilled, retreat is called for. If one defies this principle, one disrupts Heaven’s order—how much more so for human affairs?\n\nObserving the ancient and modern heroes, few preserve their later years—worthy of sighs. Only those who perceive omens and know contentment can avoid misfortune in life and leave a fragrant name behind.\n\nThe sages have said: *\"Without the strength to lift mountains or move tides, how could one turn back to see the cold place?\"*",

(Mysterious and Profound Observations)**»\n\n**Chapter on *Yingpo* (Nurturing the Vital Essence):**\n*Considerations of Variations:*\nThe *Laozi* of the *Riverbank Master* (河上公) is titled *Chapter of What Can Be Done* (《能为章》),\nwhile the *Laozi* of Zhao Shizhan (赵实庵) is titled *Chapter of the Profound True Meaning of Ebb and Flow* (《消息至真义章》).\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang* (唐明皇) expounds:\nIn the previous chapter, it is made clear that unrestrained indulgence and drowning in emotions,\nor arrogance and excess, will bring misfortune.\nThis chapter illustrates that when one nourishes the spirit and cherishes *qi* without distraction,\nthere will be no blemish.\n\nFrom *Yingpo* (Nurturing the Vital Essence) down to *Dixie* (Purifying Elimination):*\nThese teachings caution against bodily cultivation to preserve one’s *virtue/power* (德).\nFrom *Airen* (Loving Others) down to *Mingbai* (Clarity):*\nThey demonstrate that perfecting *virtue/power* (德) can enable one to rule as a sovereign.\n\nThe conclusion with *Shengzhu* (Generating and Nurturing) signifies\nthe Dao’s mysterious function manifesting in all things.\n\nDu Guangting (杜光庭) states:\nThis chapter clarifies the benefits of *Embracing the One* (抱一),\ncontrasting it with the folly of *Probing the Sharp* (揣锐) from earlier.\n*Embracing the One* ensures the spirit is whole and the vital essence secure,\nwhile *Probing the Sharp* leads to excess and inevitable ruin.\n\nAs for the subtleties of *attaining softness* (致柔) and *mysterious observation* (玄览),\nthe principles of *loving others* (爱人) and *governing the realm* (理国),\nand the harmony of the Dao’s *generating and nurturing* (生畜),\nit reveals the profound and mysterious *virtue/power* (德) of the *Commentary* (注).\n\nZhang Chongying (张冲应) responds:\nThe fifth chapter already expounds on the gate of *vital essence* (精气) entering and exiting.\nThis chapter further elucidates how *vital essence* (精) transforms into *qi* (气).\nThus, *What Can Be Done* refers to *vital essence* (精),\nwhich can be refined into *qi* (气).\n\n*Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One* (载营魄抱一):\nOne can remain steadfast without separation.\n*Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness* (专气致柔):\nThe body can be as supple as an infant.\n*Purifying Elimination and Mysterious Observation* (涤除玄览):\nOne can be without blemish.\n*Loving Others and Governing the Realm* (爱民治国):\nOne can act without interference.\n*The Celestial Gate Opens and Shuts* (天门开阖):\nOne can transcend duality.\n*Clarity and Fourfold Reach* (明白四达):\nOne can be without knowing.\n*Generating and Nurturing* (生之畜之):\nThe Dao generates without possession,\nacts without reliance,\nand nurtures without domination—\nthis is called *Mysterious Virtue/Power* (玄德).\n\n*Considerations of Variations:*\nOne version reads:\n*Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One*—\ncan one remain steadfast without separation?\n*Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness*—\ncan one be as pure as an infant?\n*Purifying Elimination and Mysterious Observation*—\ncan one be without blemish?\n*Loving Others and Governing the Realm*—\ncan one act without interference?\n*The Celestial Gate Opens and Shuts*—\ncan one transcend duality?\n*Clarity and Fourfold Reach*—\ncan one be without knowing?\n*Generating and Nurturing*—\nThe Dao generates without possession,\nacts without reliance,\nand nurtures without domination—\nthis is called *Mysterious Virtue/Power* (玄德).\n\n*Nurturing the Vital Essence* (载营魄):\nOne alternate reading is *Zai* (哉), as seen in the *Zhu* (注) version,\nwhich has been clarified below.\n\n*Can one transcend duality?* (能无雌乎):\nOne version reads *Can one transcend the feminine?* (能无雌),\nthough this may not align with the original meaning.\nIn the *Commentary*, it states: *\"Knowing its masculine, one can act without interference\"* (知其雄能无为乎).\nOne version reads: *\"Can one act without interference?\"* (能无为乎).\nAnother version states: *\"Loving others and governing the realm—*\n*can one be without knowing?\"* (爱民理国，能无知乎).\n*Clarity and Fourfold Reach—*\n*can one act without interference?\"* (明白四达，能无为乎).\n\nThe *Riverbank Master* (河上公) explains:\n*Nurturing the Vital Essence* (载营魄):\n*Qi* (营魄) refers to the *hun* (魂) and *po* (魄).\nHumans rely on the *hun* (魂) and *po* (魄) to sustain life,\nand must cherish and nourish them.\nExcessive joy or anger disturbs the *hun* (魂),\nwhile sudden fright harms the *po* (魄).\nThe *hun* (魂) resides in the liver,\nthe *po* (魄) in the lungs.\nFine wine and rich meats corrupt the liver and lungs,\nso when the *hun* (魂) is tranquil and aligned with the Dao,\nthe *po* (魄) will be secure, extending one’s lifespan and years.\n\n*Embracing the One can remain steadfast without separation* (抱一能无离):\nIf one can *embrace the One* (抱一),\nensuring it does not depart from the body,\nthen it will endure eternally.\n*The One* (一) is the primordial *vital essence* (精气) of *Great Harmony* (太和),\nthe source of the Dao.\nThus, it is said:\n*The One permeates all under Heaven* (一布名於天下),\nHeaven attains *The One* to be clear (得一以清),\nEarth attains *The One* to be settled (得一以宁),\nand sovereigns attain *The One* to establish righteousness (以为正).\n*The One* enters as the mind,\nexits as action,\nis dispersed as benevolence,\nand collectively named *The One* (总名为一).\n*The One* (一) means\nunified resolve without division (志一无二).\n\n*Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness* (专气致柔):\nIf one guards *qi* (精气) with unwavering focus,\npreventing its disorder,\nthen the body can respond with gentle compliance.\n\n*Can one be as pure as an infant?* (能婴儿):\nCan one be like an infant—\ninternally free from scheming,\nexternally free from governance—\nso that *vital essence* (精) does not dissipate?\n\n*Purifying Elimination and Mysterious Observation* (涤除玄览):\nOne should purify the mind,\nmaking it pristine and clear.\nThe mind dwells in the deepest mystery,\nobserving all things with knowing insight—\nthus it is called *Mysterious Observation* (玄览).\n\n*Can one be without blemish?* (能无疵):\nCan one avoid licentiousness and impurity,\nso that purity can be without flaw or disease?\n\n*Loving Others and Governing the Realm* (爱民治国):\nFor bodily cultivation, loving *qi* (气) ensures wholeness;\nfor governing the realm, loving the people ensures stability.\n\n*Can one act without interference?* (能无为):\nIn bodily cultivation, one breathes *qi* (精气) without letting it be heard;\nin governing the realm, one dispenses benevolence without letting it be known below.\n\n*The Celestial Gate Opens and Shuts* (天门开阖):\n*The Celestial Gate* refers to the *Purple Forbidden Enclosure* (北极紫微宫).\n*Opening and shutting* refers to the cyclical transitions of the five phases.\nIn bodily cultivation, *the Celestial Gate* signifies the nostrils—\n*opening* means inhaling,\n*shutting* means exhaling.\n\n*Can one transcend duality?* (能无雌):\nIn bodily cultivation, one should be like the feminine—\ntranquil, still, and yielding.\nIn governing the realm, one adapts to changes,\nharmonizing without discord.\n\n*Clarity and Fourfold Reach* (明白四达):\nOne’s vision and hearing are as luminous as the sun and moon,\nreaching all four directions beyond the eight extremes of the world.\nThus it is said:\n*It is unseen when observed,\nunheard when listened to—\nits brilliance spreads to all ten directions,*\n*shining resplendently and gloriously.*\n\n*Can one be without knowing?* (能无知):\nNone can fully know the Dao’s fulfillment across all under Heaven.\n\n*Generating and Nurturing* (生之畜之):\nThe Dao generates all things and nourishes them.\n*Generating without possession* (生而不有):\nThe Dao generates all things without claiming ownership.\n*Acting without reliance* (为而不恃):\nThe Dao’s actions are not done in expectation of reward.\n*Nurturing without domination* (长而不宰):\nThe Dao nurtures all things without forcing them into service.\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue/Power* (玄德).\n\nIt is said:\nThe Dao’s practice of *virtue/power* (德) is mysterious and unfathomable,\nyet it seeks to make this known to people.\n\nWang Fusi (王辅嗣) states:\n*Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One*—\ncan one remain steadfast without separation?\n*Zai* (载) means *dwelling* (处).\n*The Vital Essence* (营魄) is where humans naturally reside.\n*The One* (一) is the true nature of humanity.\nIf one can dwell in the ordinary abode of humanity,\nembrace the pure spirit of *The One*,\nand remain steadfast without separation,\nthen all things will naturally submit.\n\n*Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness*—\ncan one be as pure as an infant?\n*Specialized* (专) means *committed to* (任).\n*Attain* (致) means *to the utmost* (极).\nIf one commits to the natural *qi* (气),\nreaching the utmost harmony of softness,\ncan one be like an infant with no desires?\nThen all things will be whole and one’s nature attained.",

chaos—\nwhen the sovereign receives the Mandate in due time,\nif one remains receptive and still,\nthen one may long endure the Heavenly Blessing.\n\nAnother interpretation:\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n\"One opening, one shutting—this is called transformation.\"\nThe Sage governs the Dao, responding to change without rigidity,\nnot fixating on dominance but embracing receptivity—\nlike the Heavenly Gate’s opening and shutting,\nyielding when full and humbling when diminished.\n\n*Commentary:*\nTo cultivate virtue and become a ruler—\nthough one receives the Mandate of Heaven (the Heavenly Gate),\nthe sovereign’s Mandate originates from Heaven.\nOpening means receiving the Mandate,\nshutting means abdication.\nHeaven bestows the precious Mandate upon the virtuous—\nif one remains receptive and yielding,\none may enjoy supreme blessing.\n\nThus it is asked: Can one remain receptive?\n\nIlluminated and far-reaching—\ncan one remain unknowing?\n\nIf the sovereign remains receptive and still,\nthe myriad people joyfully extol their virtue,\nilluminated like the sun’s fourfold radiance—\nyet though forgotten, they do not rule.\nThus it is asked: Can one remain unknowing?\n\n*Commentary:*\nOnce the sovereign receives the Mandate and governs all under Heaven,\nif they remain receptive and still,\ntheir virtue shines like the sun’s illumination,\nreaching all under Heaven.\nTheir influence extends to all things,\nyet they do not claim it as their own—\nthis is called \"forgetting merit as if unknowing.\"\n\nThus it is asked: Can one remain unknowing?\n\nNurture and sustain life.\n\n*Commentary:*\nThe lower text says: *The Way gives birth, virtue nurtures.*\nHere it says \"nurture and sustain\"—\nthe sovereign follows the pure Way,\nallowing all things to fulfill their natural growth,\nand through virtue, broadly aids them,\nso each may fully realize their sustenance.\n\nThus: \"Nurture and sustain.\"\nTo give birth yet not possess—\nthis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nTo allow all things to fulfill their growth,\nyet not claim it as one’s own—\nto act yet not rely on merit,\nto lead yet not rule—\nif the sovereign can do this,\nthis is called the profound Mysterious Virtue.\n\n*Commentary:*\nThings fulfill their growth—\nthe Sage forgets their deeds.\nGrowth is naturally sufficient,\nforgetting merit ensures its permanence.\nThis is to achieve the private through the impersonal,\nto rule without ruling.\n\nThus: \"To give birth yet not possess\"—\nto allow all things to fulfill their growth,\nthe sovereign does not claim it as their own.\n\"To act yet not rely\"—\nto allow all things to move freely,\nacting without arrogance,\nnot attributing deeds to oneself.\n\"To lead yet not rule\"—\nstanding above the myriad people,\nthus called \"lead.\"\nNot relying on merit,\nthus called \"not rule.\"\n\nSo this is called the profound Mysterious Virtue.\n\nDu Guangting says:\nCarrying the *po* and embracing Oneness—\ncan one remain undivided?\n\n*Carrying*—the *po* bears it.\nThe human body is where spirit and *qi* reside,\nwhere soul and *po* dwell.\nThe body moves like a carriage bearing objects.\n*The Western Ascension Scripture* says:\n\"The body is the spirit’s carriage.\"\nSince it is likened to a carriage,\nit must bear and move.\n\nThe *po* is empty and substantial—\nthe form of *yin* *qi*, the human shape.\nThe spirit is formless *yang* *qi*—the human essence.\nIf form is present yet *yang* *qi* has not descended,\none is inert, like a lifeless stone or withered tree.\nWhen *yang* *qi* descends, movement becomes possible.\nThus, form is called *po* (belonging to *yin*),\nand spirit is called soul (belonging to *yang*).\n\nAs long as there remains even a thread of *yang* *qi*,\none does not die.\nAs long as there remains even a thread of *yin* *qi*,\none does not become immortal.\nThus, refining *yin* *qi* to exhaustion grants transcendence to the Nine Heavens—\nimmortality is the companion of *yang*.\nRefining *yang* *qi* to exhaustion plunges one into the Nine Abysses—\nthe ghostly state is the companion of *yin*.\n\nTherefore, one must preserve the *yang* soul\nand nurture the *yin* *po*\nto preserve life entirely.\n\n*Embracing Oneness*—this is guarding the Dao.\nRestraining the soul and governing the *po*,\nthe foundation is guarding the Dao.\nTo command one to guard the Dao,\nrestraining and governing—\ncan one remain undivided?\n\nThe empty form—\nwhen substance first takes shape, it is called *xiàng* (image).\n*Xiàng* means resemblance.\nLike the moon’s arc reflecting the sun’s light—\n*The Heavenly Primordium Scripture* says:\n\"The moon is *yin* *qi*, having form yet no light.\"\nThe sun is the essence of the Great Yang,\nconstantly following the Yellow Path eastward.\nIn one day and night, it travels one degree and more—\none degree equals 2,932.32 *li*.\nThe moon is the essence of Great *Yin*,\nits shape round, its essence pure.\nIt borrows the sun’s light to reveal its body—\nwhere the sun does not shine, it is called the *po*.\nIt constantly follows the Yellow Path eastward,\nsometimes deviating above or below it.\nIts speed varies—\nat its slowest, it travels 12°19'2\" per day,\naveraging 13°37',\nat its fastest, 14°9'13\"—\nslowing when swift, swift when slow.\nIn 27 days and 52/81 parts of a day,\nthe sun travels 417/81 parts of a degree—\nthis is the end of its slow and fast phases.\nThen it begins anew.\nEach month at the new moon, it aligns with the sun—\nthis is called *hézè* (conjunction).\nWhen the moon moves swiftly and the sun slowly,\nafter three days, the *po* appears.\nBeyond three days, its light gradually grows.\nOn the first quarter, the sun shines on its side,\nso from Earth, one sees it partially illuminated.\nAt the full moon, the sun and moon face each other,\nEarth lies between them,\nso its form is round and its light full.\nWhen the full moon appears in the east at dawn,\nthis is called *cè* (lateral)—\nit moves slowly.\nWhen the new moon appears in the west at dusk,\nthis is called *xiǎo* (dawn)—\nit moves swiftly.\n\n*The Heavenly Response* says:\nIts light is void like the sun’s—\nwhen the sun’s light is not extreme, it is called *ànxū* (dark emptiness).\nWhen *ànxū* aligns with the moon, there is a lunar eclipse;\nwhen it aligns with a star, the star vanishes.\nWhen the sun and moon are at new or full phase\nand travel the central path,\nthey align with *ànxū* and are eclipsed.\nThe sun and moon each span three thousand *li* in circumference,\nwith a diameter of one thousand *li*.",
      "overlap_context": "ence?\nThen transformation will be self-wrought.\n\nTeaching begins with nurturing the *po*—\nall instruction is for self-cultivation.\nWhen the self is cultivated, virtue is complete,\nand one may become a ruler.\n\n*Commentary*:\nTo love the people is to prevent sudden violence,\nto labor without harming their nature.\nTo govern the state is to prioritize agriculture,\nvaluing grain, simplifying duties—\nthen the people will find peace in life,\ntransformed without words.\n\nThis is *wuwei*.\n\nCan one do this?",

      "translated_text": "「When a person first transforms, they are called *pò* (embryo of the spirit).\n\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Zhao of the State of Lu (7th year of his reign) records:\nAt first, the Lord of Zheng (郑伯) had a policy, but was killed by Si Dai (驷带).\nThe Zheng people were alarmed and said: *\"The Lord of Zheng has come!\"*\nSome dreamed of the Lord of Zheng, who declared:\n*\"On the day *rénzǐ* (壬子), I will kill Si Dai.\"*\nThe next year, Si Dai was killed.\nThe year after that, Gong Sun Duan (公孙段) was killed.\nThe Zheng people grew even more fearful.\nSome asked Zi Chan (子产):\n*\"Can the Lord of Zheng still act as a vengeful ghost?\"*\nZi Chan replied:\n*\"When a person is born, their shadow is called *pò* (embryo of the spirit), and their luminous essence is called *hún* (spirit-soul).\nIf one’s vitality is strong, then their *hún* and *pò* are powerful.\nEven ordinary men and women, if they die violently, can still cling to the living and bring calamity and evil influence (*yínlì*—淫厉).\nHow much more so the Lord of Zheng, who held political power for three generations—\nhis spirit was strong, and he could still act as a vengeful ghost.\nThis is why he was called the Lord of Zheng:\nHe was a descendant of Duke Mu of Zheng (穆公), the grandson of Zi Liang (子良), and the son of Zi Er (子耳).\nThus, it is said that he held power for three generations.\nZi Chan then established Zi Liang Zhi (子良止) to appease him, and the disturbances ceased.*\n\n*\"The mind at death, preventing it from returning to vitality\"*—\nthis is the phrase from the *Zhuangzi’s* \"齐物篇\" (齐物 *Qíwù*—\"Equalizing Things\").\nBecause of his suffering and misfortune, his lingering spirit was bound by determination and could still act as a vengeful ghost.\nThis is like Nan Guo Zi Qi (南郭子綦) answering Zi You (子游) on the meaning of *Tiān Lài* (天籁—the \"Heavenly Response\").\n\n*Purity and unity (*chúnyī*—淳一), without separation (*bùlí*—不离)—*\nthis means harmonizing and refining, removing impurities and stopping chaos, so that nothing is mixed.\nThe *Laozi* (老君) understood this principle of nurturing the *pò* (embryo of the spirit) and maintaining unity,\nand thus taught people how to cultivate their *shén* (神—spirit).\n\nThe *Shàngqīng Yǐnshū* (上清隐书—\"Hidden Scriptures of the High Clarity\") speaks of the methods of *Yùyí Bēnrì* (郁仪奔日) and *Jiélié Bēnyuè* (结璘奔月)—\nthe *Dao* (Way) of chasing the sun and moon.\nIt states that within the sun and moon, there dwell five *Dì* (帝—Celestial Sovereigns).\nBy calling upon the taboos within the sun and moon,\nand visualizing the forms and attire of the five *Dì*,\nthey descend to bestow upon you their blessings.\nThus, you absorb the radiance of the sun and moon,\nand those who practice this method can live as long as the sun and moon themselves.\n\nIt also speaks of the method of *Jūhún Zhìpò* (拘魂制魄)—\ncontrolling the spirit-soul (*hún*) and restraining the embryo of the spirit (*pò*).\nOn the 3rd, 13th, and 23rd days of the lunar month,\none focuses on the transformation of the red *qi* (赤气) within the mind,\nand invokes the names of the three *hún* (三魂):\n*Tāiguāng* (胎光—\"Fetal Light\"), *Shuǎnglíng* (爽灵—\"Vigorous Spirit\"), and *Yōuxīng* (幽精—\"Mysterious Essence\").\nThen, through secret incantations (*mìzhòu*—密咒), one binds the spirit-soul (*jūhún*—拘魂).\nOn the new moon, full moon, and waning days,\none focuses on the transformation of the white *qi* (白气) at the tip of the nose,\nand invokes the names of the seven *pò* (七魄):\n*Shīgǒu* (尸狗—\"Corpse Dog\"), *Fúshǐ* (伏矢—\"Hidden Arrow\"), *Qiǎoyīn* (雀阴—\"Sparrow Shadow\"), *Tūnyé* (吞贼—\"Devouring Thief\"), *Chúhuì* (除秽—\"Removing Filth\"), *Chòufèi* (臭肺—\"Foul Lung\"), and *Fěidú* (非毒—\"Non-Venom\").\nThen, through secret incantations (*mìzhòu*—密咒), one restrains the embryo of the spirit (*zhìpò*—制魄).\nEach has its own method of concentration and incantation,\nas detailed in the *Shàngqīng Pǐnzhōng* (上清品中—\"High Clarity Canon\").\nPracticed diligently over time, this can enable one to move effortlessly (*qīngjǔ*—轻举).\n\nThis is the *Tàishàng* (太上—\"Supreme Venerable\")’s method of nurturing and protecting the ethereal embryo of the spirit (*yūpò*—虚魄),\nand transcending the world to achieve longevity (*dùshì chángshēng*—度世长生).\n\nCan one concentrate their *qi* to achieve such softness (*zhìróu*—致柔) as a baby?\nA baby does not yet know, and yet answers questions with ease.\nThey are entirely devoted to the pure and harmonious *qi*,\nuntainted by external influences and free from internal thoughts and worries.\nTheir nature follows the softness of *qi*, so their pure and harmonious *qi* does not disperse.\n\nThose who guard the *Dao* should be like babies—\nfree from external defilements and internal thoughts,\nso that their spirit does not leave their body.\n\nThe *Xīshēng Jīng* (西升经—\"Scripture of the Rising in the West\") says:\n*\"It is better to pity oneself than to pity others,\nbetter to love oneself than to love the spirit,\nbetter to contain the spirit than to love it,\nand better to guard the True than to contain the spirit.\nGuarding the True ensures lasting existence.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"The spirit loves the body, but the body does not love the spirit.\nThus, the *Laozi* teaches people to nurture the spirit and *qi*.\"*\n\nCan one purify and refine (*xǐchú xuànlǎn*—涤除玄览) to avoid flaws?\nThe mind’s illumination (*zhīnguāng*—心之照) penetrates all existence and non-existence,\nspanning the heavens and earth.\nIt responds to circumstances immediately and moves with the environment.\nIf one does not regulate it with clarity and purity (*chéngjìng*—澄浄),\nthen it will be entangled by desires and sink into defilements (*dònglún rǎn yù*—动沦染欲).\nOnce entangled by desires, all evils arise (*wàn’è shēng*—万恶生).\nWhen all evils arise, diseases and calamities follow (*bìbìng zuò*—庇病作).\nThe *Laozi* warns against this:\nRefine and purify the mind, cutting away desires (*jiǎnqù yùxīn*—翦去欲心).\nWhen the mind’s illumination is clear and pure (*xīnzhào qīngjìng*—心照清浄),\nthere will be no flaws or diseases.\n\nThe *Xīshēng Jīng* says:\n*\"The spirit that gives life to me is the spirit (*shén*—神),\nbut the mind that harms me is the mind (*xīn*—心).\"*\nThus, the teaching is to regulate the mind (*xiūxīn*—修心),\nto control intentions and thoughts, and return to a state free from worries.\n\nCan one govern the people and the state (*àimín lǐguó*—爱民理国) without action (*wúwéi*—无为)?\nThe people are the foundation of the state (*guóběn*—国本).\n*Wúwéi* (无为) is the transformation of the *Dao*.\nIf one governs with the transformation of *wúwéi*—\nloving and nurturing the people—\nthen the foundation of the state is secured.\nIf governance is harsh and oppressive (*zhèngzhèng kuāiyí*—政虐而苛),\nthen it becomes tyranny (*bàomì*—暴).\nIf taxes are heavy and labor burdensome (*fùzhòng yìfán*—赋重役繁),\nthen it harms the people’s nature (*shāngxìng*—伤性).\nIf one does not act according to the seasons (*shǐzhī bùyǐshí*—使之不以时),\nthen it disrupts agriculture (*fángnóng*—妨农).\nIf one does not practice frugality and simplicity (*bùmù jiǎnyuē*—不务俭约),\nthen the value of grain will diminish (*jiàngǔ*—贱谷).\nThis is the teaching on governing the state (*lǐguó*—理国).\n\nThe essence of being a ruler (*jūnzǐ*—君子) is to take the *Dao* as foundation\nand *dé* (德—virtue/power) as root.\nIf one loses the *Dao* and virtue/power, how can they rule over the people?\nThis is the core of the *Laozi*’s teaching on governing the state.\n\nCan one open and close the *Tiānmén* (天门—the \"Heavenly Gate\") without imbalance (*wúcī*—无雌)?\nEven after cultivating the love of the people and the governance of the state,\nand becoming a ruler who sits in state (*chuíyī nánmiàn*—垂衣南面),\none must still respect oneself and follow Heaven,\nto align with the natural order (*lìshù*—历数).\n*Lìshù* refers to the received mandate (*shòumìng*—受命) of Heaven\nand the cycles of the *Wǔyùn* (五运—the Five Phases).\n\nShun commanded Yu:\n*\"The mandate of Heaven and its cycles rest upon you.\"*\nWhen the celestial blessings (*tiānlù*—天禄) are eternal and enduring (*yǒngzhōng*—永终),\nit means that the mandate and cycles are upon you,\nto inherit Heaven’s command and thus become a great treasure (*dàbǎo*—大宝) for the people.\nThis is called *bǎomìng* (宝命—\"treasured mandate\").\nIt is granted from Heaven, hence it is said to be received from Heaven.\nThe *Yìjīng* (易经) *Xì* (系) says:\n*\"The greatest treasure of the sage is called ‘position’ (位).\"*\nWhen the *Tiānmén* (天门) opens, extraordinary celestial omens descend (*jiàngfēicháng*—降非常之瑞),\nsuch as the Yellow Star moving with vibrant colors (*huángxīng dòngcǎi*—黄星动彩),\nthe Red Star appearing and displaying auspicious symbols (*chìfú biǎofú*—赤伏表符),\nthe Purple *Qi* (气) filling the courtyard (*zǐqì chōngtíng*—紫气充庭),\nthe Five Stars gathering at the Well (*wǔxīng jùjǐng*—五星聚井),\nthe Rainbow flowing through the moon (*liúhóng guànyuè*—流虹贯月),\nthe Great Thunder encircling the celestial axis (*dàdiàn rào shū*—大电绕枢),\nand the celestial blessings descending upon mountains to bestow worthy ministers (*yìngyuè jiàngxián*—应天顺人, 拯物除害),\nand the birth of stars to command assistance (*dànxīng mìngfǔ*—诞星命辅).\nThus, one responds to Heaven and follows the people,\nrelieving suffering and removing harm,\nwhile inheriting the mandate and cycles to possess the world (*yǒutiānxià*—有天下).\n\nBut when a ruler loses their proper place (*lín yù shīsuǒ*—临御失所),\ntheir punishments and policies become misaligned (*xíngzhèng kuāiyí*—刑政乖宜),\nand the people rebel while kin abandon them (*zhòngpàn qīnlí*—众叛亲离),\nthen war and calamity arise (*bīngjiāo huòqǐ*—兵交祸起).\nWhen rebellion and disorder emerge from below (*nìlùn shēngyúxià*—逆乱生於下),\nthe celestial signs manifest above (*qìxiàng jiànyúshàng*—气象见於上),\nsuch as the sky splitting open (*xiāotiān kāi*—霄天开),\nmountains collapsing and rivers drying up (*shānbēng chuānjié*—山崩川竭),\nand disasters swarming like bees (*zāi xiōng fēngqǐ*—灾凶蜂起),\nuntil the state perishes (*guówáng*—国亡).\nThis is the closing of the *Tiānmén* (天门).\n\nThe alternation of opening and closing is called *biàn* (变)—\nas the *Yìjīng* (易经) *Xì* (系) states:\n*\"The meaning of opening and closing is that yin and yang follow in succession,\nand the principles of dependence and withdrawal (*yīfú*—倚伏) are fulfilled.\"*\n\nTo diminish fullness and increase humility (*kuī yíng ér yì

guarding is focused and movement is soft,\nand one’s virtue compares to that of an infant,\nthen one’s mind can be cleansed and refined,\nits spirit washed and illuminated in Heaven.\nAll dharmas are empty, yet none burden with their weight.\nThus it is said: *\"To focus the qi and attain softness—can one be like an infant?\"*\nAnd then to purify and perceive the Mysterious—can one be without flaw?\n\nTo purify and perceive the Mysterious—can one be without flaw?\nPurification speaks of washing the heart,\nremoval speaks of excavating the heart.\nWash it, and nothing remains unclean;\nexcavate it, and nothing remains unempty.\nTranscendent and observing, all dharmas are empty—\nthen one can establish laws from emptiness,\nand share with the people the joys and calamities of fate.\nThus it is said: *\"To purify and perceive the Mysterious—can one be without flaw?\"*\n\nTo love the people and govern the state—can one act without action?\nToward the people, one loves them by not loving them;\nin governing the state, one rules by not ruling.\nThe Dao accomplishes all without doing—\nthen one can remain motionless and still,\nresponding naturally to the workings of Heaven and Earth.\nThus one acts only when unavoidable,\nresponds only when sought—\nand so it is said: *\"To love the people and govern the state—can one act without action?\"*\nAnd then to open and close the Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?\n\nThe Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?\nThe Heavenly Gate is the void.\nSpirit and qi flow in and out,\nopening and closing in unity—\nall things emerge from here, return to here,\nand their transformations are boundless.\nThe Heavenly Gate, opening and closing with all things,\nyet without duality—\nthen one can attain round enlightenment, universally illuminating,\ngreatly communicating the four directions,\npenetrating to the utmost without obstruction,\nreaching the profound without awareness.\nThus it is said: *\"To open and close the Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?\"*\nAnd then to be clear and all-pervading—can one be without knowing?\n\nTo be clear and all-pervading—can one be without knowing?\nTo bear the soul and embrace the One—can one be without separation?\nTo love the people and govern the state—can one act without action?\nThis is the Sage.\n\nTo open and close the Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?\nTo be clear and penetrating—can one be without knowing?\nThis is the Divine Person.\n\nMaster Lu Nong said:\nTo bear the soul—\nthe soul is yin, the master of form.\nThe spirit, vast and all-pervading yet unaware of itself,\nordinarily abides in the soul,\nand thus the spirit becomes constrained by the body.\nThe expansive becomes confined,\nthe fluid becomes stagnant.\nThose who study this Way must first broaden their will and qi,\nnot burdened by the body,\nso that the spirit abides in the soul and not the soul.\nThen one can embrace the One and embody the spirit.\n\nI have often reasoned:\nWhen a person dies, there are differences in ascent and descent—\ntruly because the spirit perishes to serve the form,\nfollowing the soul, descending into darkness and transforming into other things.\nBut for those whose spirit is complete,\neven if the soul is stagnant in yin,\nthe essence and spirit unite as one,\nand nothing can hinder them.\nThe Sage’s death is said to be *\"the spirit not following the soul.\"*\nAt first, even the Sage bears the soul alone.\nTo embrace the One—\nthe One is the number of essence;\nthough not called essence, to guard the One is to keep essence steady.\nCan one be without separation?\n\nLearning the Way returns to restoring nature,\nrestoring nature returns to embodying the spirit.\nWhat prevents one from embodying the spirit\nis pursuing externals while forgetting the root,\nexchanging the self for things.\nThus, losing essence and failing in spirit,\none sinks into base stupidity.\n\nThe vital essences of yin and yang are soul and spirit.\nThe soul is yang and wanders,\nwhile what anchors the body is the soul’s counterpart—\nthe soul is yin and stills.\nThus, the student must first calm their will and qi,\nso that essence and soul are tranquil and unified.\nWhen the soul is still, the spirit settles;\nwhen essence is unified, the spirit is complete.\n\nLife is born from water—water is essence.\nAt birth, essence gathers the spirit.\nOriginally whole yet unaware,\nit often scatters and dissipates—\nthis is called *wangliang* (the two shadows).\n*Wang* means the spirit is unclear,\n*liang* means essence is not unified.\nZhuangzi said: *\"Do not shake your essence—*\nthis is called embracing the One.\"*\n\nThe spirit and qi are the symbols of fire and water.\nFire has no fixed form;\nwhen essence shines, the spirit becomes boundless and formless,\nunable to be constrained by kings—\nonly preserve essence.\nLike adding oil to make fire bright,\nnurturing roots to make leaves flourish.\nWhen soul, spirit, and essence are undiminished,\nthen the heart is strong and qi flows smoothly,\nuncontrolled by things.\nStillness embodies the Dao,\naction aligns with principle—\nrefined to the utmost,\nthe spirit becomes One,\ntranscending the four names.\nThis is the ultimate subtlety of the student—\nall ages of sages and worthies follow this truth.\nSeeking lies not outside;\nit must be attained by the heart.\n\nTo focus the qi and attain softness—can one be like an infant?\nHuman life has three aspects: essence, spirit, and qi.\nWhen essence is complete, the spirit reigns;\nwhen the spirit reigns, it can command the qi.\nIf the spirit weakens and cannot command the qi,\nthen the spirit’s movements are erratic,\nleading one astray from the Way.\nMencius said: *\"The will is the commander of qi.\"*\nYang Xiong said: *\"Qi is the horse that carries one to good or evil.\nIf the teacher is weak and the troops rebellious, the teacher will perish;\nif the horse rages and the driver is exhausted, the chariot will fail.\"*\nWhen the spirit cannot focus the qi,\njoy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise from qi,\ndriving one into chaos—\nthis is the natural order.\nAncient scholars all understood this.\nIf one has not yet attained this,\nthey must first purify the heart to guard against it.\nThe three warnings of Confucius are all about guarding the qi.\nAmong his disciples, only Yan Hui could focus the qi,\nthus it is said: *\"He did not transfer his anger.\"*\nQi’s violence manifests in yang,\nand nothing is more violent than anger in yang.\nIf one can avoid transferring anger,\nwhat else is this but focusing the qi?\n\nHuman beings are originally endowed with sage nature,\nbut when qi dissipates and cannot be focused,\nit is said: *\"As one grows older, one drifts further from the Way.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「To embrace *Oneness* (抱一), the spirit becomes sovereign (神王).\nWhen the spirit is sovereign, the qi becomes gentle (气柔),\nand when the qi is gentle, the *Essence* (真) is preserved.\n\nThe reason one can align with an infant’s focused concentration (同专者),\nis that they possess the power without claiming authority (有而擅其权之谓).\n\nCan one purify and perceive the *Mysterious* (玄) without flaw (疵)?\nThis is the art of focusing the qi—\nwhen the qi is focused, the nature becomes settled (性定),\nand when the nature is settled, wisdom becomes clear (智明).\nWith wisdom clear, one can then wash away impurities (荡涤除去)\nand attain the *Mysterious Vision* (玄览) of utmost subtlety (至妙).\nHaving illuminated its principle (烛其理),\nall phenomena in the world become the same as this utmost subtlety.\nIf one still perceives any flaw (观一疵),\nthen one does not yet recognize the principle (非识理也).\n\nTo love the people and govern the state (爱民治国),\ncan one truly act without doing (无为)?\nAs explained above, the Way for oneself is complete (为己之道尽矣).\nThus, one can extend its remainder to others (及人也).\n\nThe Master Laozi’s teaching is focused on restoring one’s nature (复性).\nTo act with doing (有为) is not the means to let the people dwell in their true nature (安性).\nThus, though he loves governance (爱治),\nhe does not uphold doing (不尚有为)—\nthis is the ultimate Dao (此道之至也).\n\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate* (天门),\ncan one truly act without *feminine* (雌)?\nThe Sage has no intent to act (无心於作),\nbut their spirit enters and exits in response (精神出入皆应)\nwithout any artificial display (不唱).\nThis is what Zhuangzi called *\"the one who receives the essence of things\"* (有物采之者),\nand Laozi, in the season of autumn (四时当秋),\nwhen his *virtue/power* (德) generates *Metal* (金),\nwas the master of stillness and restoring *Oneness* (静一复性者也).\nHence, his teachings emphasize this.\n\nAs for the *Yijing* (《易》),\nboth the *Primordial* (先天) and *Subsequent* (后天) are nothing but the Dao (无非道者).\nTo be *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达),\nis one not to be without knowing (无知)?\nThe principle is beyond knowing (理无足知).\nKnowing is merely the response to things (知以应物).\nOnce one knows the ultimate principle (既知至理),\nthey naturally remain in constant *non-knowing* (自常无知).\nOnly through *non-knowing* can one truly know all (无所不知).\nIf one were to claim knowing (昭然有知),\nthen one is truly without knowing (是不知).\nThe subtlety of *non-knowing* (无知之妙),\nhow could it be called knowing (何足谓知也)?\n\nExamining this thoroughly (切尝论之),\nwhether one is a Sage or a fool (圣智下愚),\nthey originally share no distinction (本无殊品).\nIt is only through foolishness that wisdom becomes apparent (因愚显智),\nand thus the name of Sage arises (乃有圣名).\nThe Sage’s original heart (本心),\nhas never been inherently Sage (何尝自圣).\nHence, *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达)\nwhile initially knowing nothing (初无所知),\nis the Sage’s true knowing (乃圣人之知也).\n\nTo nurture and sustain life (生之畜之).\nThe Dao is complete as said above (道备如上),\nso that *creation and transformation* (造化) lie within oneself (在我),\nand one can nurture and sustain all things (可以生畜万物矣).\n\nTo give birth without possession (生而不有).\nThe Dao generates all things (道生万物),\nand things are always one with the Dao (物之与道常为一体).\nWho could claim to possess them?\n\nTo act without reliance (为而不恃).\nWhen forced to act (不得已而为之),\neven if one performs deeds (於已然之时),\ntheir essence transcends and self-destroys (虽有为为之功，而超然自丧),\nhow could they still boast or err (岂复矜哉)?\nTo extend without slaughtering (长而不宰).\nThe Dao, as explained above (如上文),\ncan lengthen and sustain all under Heaven without doing (可以长天下以无为矣).\nThough it stands above things like a *flagpole* (标枝),\nhow could it have the power of division (岂有分割之功乎)?\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue* (玄德).\n*Mysterious* (玄) refers to the subtle essence (妙体),\nand *virtue* (德) is the ultimate (至也).\nIn ancient times, Shun dwelled in *Mysterious Virtue* (侧微，《书》称玄德).\nTruly, the ultimate *virtue/power* (至德) is always found\nin *non-thinking and non-doing* (无思无为).\nThis chapter’s meaning centers on *non-doing* (主於无为).\nThus, though it speaks of extending (为长),\nits *virtue/power* is especially called *Mysterious* (德尤称玄).\n\nThis chapter, from the scholar (士) to attaining\nthe *entry of spirit into Sagehood* (体神入圣),\nhas fully exhausted the sequence of self-cultivation (修身之序尽矣).\n\nLiu Zhongping said:\nEmbrace *Oneness* (抱一).\n*Concentrate oneness* (致一) is the essence of its meaning (所以精义),\nembrace *Oneness* (抱一) is the means to respond to changes (所以应变),\nand *return to Oneness* (反一) is the way to enter the spirit (所以入神).\nThus, the *Way* of the gentleman begins with *concentrating oneness* (致一),\nis applied through *embracing Oneness* (抱一),\nand is hidden in *returning to Oneness* (反一).\n\nCan one focus the qi and govern with gentleness (专气政柔),\nlike an infant (婴儿)?\nWhen humans are born, in infancy the qi is focused and *Oneness* is concentrated (致一),\nreaching the utmost of *Essence* (真).\nAs they grow older, emotions arise (情生),\nreaching the utmost of *artifice* (伪).\nOnly those who understand the Dao (知道者),\nwhen they seek fame (营名), lose their *Essence* (真),\nand when they seek profit (为利), drift into *artifice* (伪).\nThis is called the ability to restore (能复者也).\n\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate* (天门),\ncan one truly act without *feminine* (雌)?\nOpening and closing (开阖) are the applications of transformation (变化之用).\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Qian* (乾) employs *beauty* (美) and *advantage* (利) to benefit all under Heaven,\nbut does not speak of what it benefits—\ngreat indeed!\" (不言所利，大矣哉).\nThis means the *Qian* (乾) Dao employs *greatness* (大) as its function (为用).\nIf one transforms by the *Qian* Dao,\nthey also employ *greatness* in their function (用乎大).\nTo guard its *feminine* (守其雌) is merely to say,\n\"I am what I naturally protect\" (盖言吾所自守云耳).\nIf one can guard its *feminine*,\nthen their function must surely be *great* (其用也必大).\n\nTo be *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达),\ncan one truly be without knowing (无知)?\nIf one strives to be *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达)\nwhile anxiously attending to maintaining harmony (汲汲乎以事平和),\nis this not small (不亦小乎)?\nThus, there is knowing that is small (有知小)\nand there is knowing through *non-knowing* (无知之知).\n\nLiu Jiji said:\nTo *carry and sustain* (载) the *vital energies and spirit* (营魄).\nWhen humans are born, the *yang* energies (诸阳) are the *hun* (魂),\nand the *yin* energies (诸阴) are the *po* (魄).\nEach has its name and form (名象),\nand is stored between the liver and lungs (藏於肝肺之间).\nThe lesser scholar knows of them (下士知之),\nwhile the greater scholar perceives them (上士见之).\nThe *Essence* (精) and *spirit* (神) rely on one another to generate life (相依以生),\nand together, the *Essence* entering and exiting (并精出入),\nis the *po* (魄).\nThe *hun* (魂) is what comes and goes with the *spirit* (神).\nThis chapter speaks of *carrying and sustaining* (载营魄),\nand *camp* (营) is the same as *hun* (魂).\nThe Yellow Emperor said:\n*\"To move and sustain the body is called the *hun* (动以营身，谓之魂).\"*\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"A wandering *hun* (游魂) is transformation,\"*\nand Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Its *hun* (魂) does not grow weary,\"*\nall referring to *hun* (魂),\nwhich governs movement and action (主经营动作),\nserving as the vital function of the body (为一身之运).\nAs for the *po* (魄),\nit is the *Essence* entering and exiting (并精出入),\nand nothing but the generation and transformation of life (生化成变).\n\nNow, the hundred bones and nine orifices (百骸九窍)\ncomposing one’s form (具吾形),\nare all the *po* (魄)'s domain (魄之属也).\nIf not for the *po* (魄) to sustain them (以营之),\nwhat would distinguish them from a *walking corpse* (行尸)?\n\nThe *po* (魄) cannot exist without the *hun* (魂),\njust as the moon cannot exist without the sun (犹月不可以无日).\nThe *po* (魄) depends on the *hun* (魂) to form *camp* (营),\nand the moon depends on the sun to generate light (月待日而生光).\nHere, it speaks of the *hun*’s function (魂之用) as *camp* (营),\nand the *po*’s essence (魄之体) as *po* (魄).\n\n*Carry* (载) means to bear with form (以形载).\nForm is like a *chariot* (车).\nThe *po* (魄) and *hun* (魂) are the *chariot*’s accumulation (车之积).\nIn the world, there are those who carry the *hun* (魂) but not the *po* (魄),\nthose who carry the *po* (魄) but not the *hun* (魂),\nand those who carry both *hun* and *po* (魂魄两载).\n\nTo carry the *hun* without the *po* is the greater scholar (上士).\nTo carry the *po* without the *hun* is the lesser scholar (下士).\nTo carry both is the middle scholar (中士).\nThe greater scholar preserves their *yang* purity and ascends as a *transcendent* (浮仙),\nthe lesser scholar is impure and sinks into the *ghostly* (沉鬼),\nwhile the middle scholar cultivates their form (修其形).\n\nCan one embrace *Oneness* without separation (抱一能无离)?\nTo carry and sustain the *vital energies and spirit* (载营魄),\ntheir practice lies solely in embracing *Oneness* (抱一).\nThe Dao generates *Oneness* (道生一),\n*Oneness* generates *Water* (一生水),\n*Water* generates *Essence* (水生精),\nand *Essence* is the substance of *Oneness* (精者一之物).\nTo embrace *Oneness* is to unite with *Essence*

      "translated_text": "When *Essence* is complete, *qi* is whole, and when *qi* is whole, *spirit* is whole—\nwith *spirit* whole, one may govern the *hun* (soul),\nand thus the *po* (ethereal soul) belongs to the greater scholar.\n\nFor *Essence* is the source by which Heaven and Earth, all things, are born and formed.\nYet *Essence* is ever stingy to man, while man ever wastes it—\nleaking through orifices without measure,\nuntil the *yin* is exhausted and death ensues—\nthen it is said that *Essence* has departed.\nBut it is not that *Essence* has truly departed—\nrather, man himself has caused its separation.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Not to depart from Essence is called a Divine Person.\"*\nThus it is said: *\"Can one truly not depart?\"*\n\nCan one focus *qi* and attain supreme softness?\nTo focus *qi* means *qi* is not dispersed;\nto attain softness means to reach utmost harmony—\nthis is the natural state of an infant.\nIf one who cultivates the Dao can be thus,\nthen *qi* will be whole.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said:\n*\"The origin of *born qi* is the root of the Twelve Meridians—*\nthat which stirs between the kidneys.\nFor all that enters and exits through the nose and mouth,\nall movements of the hands and feet,\nare nourished by the Five Grains, supplemented by the Five Livestock,\nassisted by the Five Fruits, filled by the Five Vegetables,\nmoistened by wine and rice wine,\nand balanced by fragrant herbs and medicinal stones—\nharmonized and refined, they enter the meridians as *honor* (nutritive *qi*),\nsmooth and swift, circulating to defend the skin—\nall are but the secondary functions of *born qi*,\nwhile its source is guarded between the kidneys,\nfrom which the myriad three thousand five hundred breaths arise.\n\nWhen this *qi* flows into knowledge and desire,\nit becomes unfocused and loses its softness,\nwhile joy, anger, sorrow, and delight manifest within,\nand youth, vigor, aging, and death manifest without—\na seven-foot frame, yet but as dung and soil.\n\nAn infant, unaware of male and female union,\nhas *qi* that may be called focused.\nTo wail all day without hoarseness—\nits harmony is extreme.\n\nMan is born with *commission* (and *response*) in harmony,\nyet what causes discord is failing to focus *qi* and instead acting violently.\n\nThus, the subtle principle of preserving whole *qi* is as follows:\n*\"The Perfect Man does not lose the heart of an infant.\"*\n\nCan one purify and gaze into the profound without blemish?\nThe heart harbors *spirit*—\nthe heart is like a mirror,\n*spirit* like a valley.\nTo exhaust the principles of the world in a single illumination—\nthat is the heart alone.\n\nYet those who can illuminate with *spirit* must delve deeply,\nfor their darkness is profound and their vision distant—\nthus it is called *profound gazing*.\nThe heart is inherently profound and gazing,\nyet what defiles it, making it unclear?\nWhat obstructs it, making it unvast?\nOnly when one cannot master things does *Essence* depart,\n*qi* weaken, and *spirit* leave—\nwhen *spirit* departs, one falls into darkness and faintness,\nfor all things are defiled, all things are obstructed.\n\nAs when a man walks at night and sees nothing—\nthis is his clarity,\nyet it is self-purified;\nthis is his vastness,\nyet it is self-emptied.\n\nThus, the ailments of *profound gazing* do not come from without.\nOnly the Sage can illuminate without purification—\nthis is not a matter of cultivating the Dao.\nAs Zhuangzi said: *\"To reach it is to enter its blemish.\"*\n\nThis chapter takes preserving whole *Essence*, whole *qi*, and whole *spirit*\nas the root of cultivating the Dao.\nThus, *\"not departing\"* speaks to nurturing *Essence*,\n*\"like an infant\"* speaks to nurturing *qi*,\nand *\"without blemish\"* speaks to nurturing *spirit*.\n\nTo love the people and govern the state—\ncan one act without doing?\nZhuangzi said: *\"The true Dao governs the body,\nits remnants govern the state.\"*\nTo love the people is *ren* (benevolence).\nTo govern the state is *zheng* (administration).\nThe affairs of kings and lords cannot avoid action,\nyet if viewed as straw dogs,\nthey may be attained.\n\nCan the *Heavenly Gate* open and close without distinction?\nHe who accomplishes affairs must follow the Dao of Heaven—\nthus this speaks of the *Heavenly Gate*.\nZhuangzi said: *\"The Heavenly Gate has no existence.\nAll things arise from non-existence.\"*\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"One closing, one opening, is called *change*.\"*\nFor the Dao of Heaven governs *change*—\nto love the people and govern the state\nis to follow Heaven alone.\nWhy seek to act like a male?\nIf unavoidable, then respond—but no more.\n\nTo be clear and all-reaching—\ncan one know without knowing?\n*Clarity* is knowing;\n*all-reaching* is knowing without knowing.\nIf one knows both self and others,\nthen one may be said to know without knowing.\nNot retreating into secrecy—\nif one can know without knowing while containing wisdom,\nthen *hun* and *po* may fear they have no vessel,\nand *spirit*, *qi*, and *Essence* may fear they cannot be preserved—\nperhaps then one may attain two hundred years without decay of form.\n\nTo give birth and to nurture—\n*giving birth* is the Dao,\n*nurturing* is *virtue*.\nAs spoken above, this is not for those who do not embody *Dao* and *virtue*.\n\nTo give birth without possessing—\nI give birth to it, yet do not possess it;\nnot possessing it, then my giving birth is not my possession.\nTo act without relying—\nif one gives birth without acting, the principle of life is severed;\nthough one acts, if one relies upon it, one loses what was done.\nTo grow without controlling—\nI give birth to it, I act upon it—\nthis is enough to nourish all things.\nWithout me, there is supreme nurturing—\nthis is called *profound virtue*.\nTo call *profound* a *virtue*—\nhow could one possess, rely, or control it?\nTo not possess, not rely, not control—\nthus it is called the *Dao*.\nOnce action is complete, the *Dao* descends as *virtue*—\nthus it is called *profound virtue*.\n*Profound virtue* is what, above, encompasses the *Dao*.\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of withdrawing from worldly affairs,\nyet sought closeness to the body—\nthus next comes *carrying the vital energies and spirit*.\nLiu Ji said: *\"From carrying the vital energies and spirit to this is called profound virtue.\"*\n\nThe *hun* is a *yang* thing,\nthe *po* is a *yin* thing.\nOne *yin* and one *yang*—this is the *Dao*;\nexcess *yin* or excess *yang*—this is illness.\n*Yin* is the complement of *yang*, yet also its bane—\nthus the *hun* carries the *po* and nurtures it,\nso that *yin* and *yang* may harmonize,\nneither harming the other, and *virtue* returns to them.\nYet is there another way?\nIt is simply *Oneness* that governs it.\n\n*Oneness* is a thing not two—\nits generation of things is unfathomable,\nneither *yin* nor *yang*,\nyet not separate from *yin* and *yang*—\nit can harmonize *yin* and *yang*.\nThus, to carry the vital energies and spirit while embracing *Oneness*—\ncan one truly not depart?\n\nThe Sage embraces *Oneness* without departing,\nthe heart containing nothing—\nwithin the boundless and boundless,\n*spirit* is guarded;\nwithin the dim and dim,\n*spirit* is naturally true.",

loving the people and governing the state—\nwhy so?\n\nBecause the body is a microcosm of the state.\nThe Sage takes the heart as sovereign,\nthe body as the realm,\n*qi* as the people—\nthus, *wuwei* is the way to honor the sovereign.\n\nWhen the heart practices *wuwei*, it is exalted above all,\nand the myriad *qi* move spontaneously,\nthe hundred limbs govern themselves.\nPreserving *qi* is how

      "translated_text": "「Thus, when the foundation is firmly established and cannot be uprooted,\nuntil the moment when the **yáng** embryo descends into the lower furnace,\nits breath is left to its own accord,\nand the **Dao** is fulfilled.\n\nTherefore, the *Classic* does not speak of *numbers* but speaks of *numbers*,\ndoes not speak of *medicines* but speaks of *medicines*.\nThe principles of **Lead (Qīan)** and **Mercury (Gǒng)** are fully contained here.\n\n**Next, the method of refining with the *jiǎ* (metal):**\nSix stages in total.\n1. **Taming and subduing the Golden Tiger (Jīn Hǔ).**\n   Can one who embraces Oneness remain undivided?\n\n   The six transformations are the **Dao**.\n   The name of the transformation is the union of **sun and moon**.\n   Before their union, there is no **yin and yang**;\n   after their union, they correspond to **water and fire**.\n   This is the **Heaven and Earth’s natural Elixir (Huán Dān)**.\n\n   The natural Elixir of Heaven and Earth is inherently possessed,\n   neither abandoned nor detached.\n   When we speak of \"embracing,\" it means\n   that humans cannot align with Heaven and Earth’s natural spontaneity.\n   By relying on the three substances—**Lead, Mercury, and Metal (Jīn)**—\n   through the symbols of the transformation,\n   we seize the natural **qi** of Heaven and Earth,\n   manipulate the furnace and crucible,\n   and refine the supreme medicine.\n   Thus, we emulate Heaven and Earth’s natural spontaneity.\n\n   When speaking of humans, \"embracing Oneness\" means\n   to remain undivided—\n   this is yet unpermitted speech.\n\n   In general, when people speak of \"embracing Oneness,\"\n   what constitutes this \"One\"?\n\n   If \"One\" is taken as a *number*, some say it is akin to **four (Lì)**;\n   if \"One\" is taken as *advancement*, some say it is like **muddying the tracks (Nì)**.\n   One must extinguish this \"One\"\n   to verify the essence of **profound stillness (Zhàn Jìng)**.\n   These are all methods of annihilation,\n   not the **Dao of eternal transformation**.\n\n   Therefore, the **Supreme Sage (Tài Shàng)** says:\n   *\"To know the One is to complete all things.\n   To not know the One is to have nothing to know.\n   This is a profound statement.\"*\n\n   When speaking of *numbers*, from One comes Two,\n   from Two comes Three.\n   When speaking of **qi**, the One is the **original breath (Shǐ qì)**,\n   the original being **pre-Heaven (Xiān Tiān)**,\n   the same as the **Dao’s substance (tǐ)**.\n   For humans, it is the **foundation of life (mìng)**.\n   To establish the root of life,\n   what is more fundamental than the One?\n   The One is formless and boundless,\n   dispersed throughout all things.\n\n   Today’s \"embracing Oneness\" is actually the **embracing of yang**.\n   Life and vitality arise from this.\n   **Liezi** says:\n   *\"Is the **Dao** formless?\n   It is called embracing the **void (xū)** yet not the void—\n   the **symbols (xiàng)** cannot be deceived;\n   it is called embracing the **real (shí)** yet not the real—\n   the **Dao’s essence** is without attachment.\n   This is the mystery of having and not having,\n   which cannot be preserved by itself—\n   this is the **Dao’s subtlety**.\"*\n\n   Thus, one knows that the One is the **Dao**.\n   The **Dao** is the **principle of yin and yang (yáng)**.\n   The **Dao** is **yin and yang** themselves.\n   Therefore, the **Dao** is called **One yin and One yang**,\n   and it is also said, **\"transformation is called eternal generation.\"**\n   The **yin and yang** generate each other,\n   their transformations endless,\n   like the **sun and moon’s** separation and union,\n   their **eclipse and manifestation** following natural law.\n\n   Hence, at the moon’s initial birth,\n   seizing fire for **nourishment (yǎng)**,\n   one transformation leads to **nine (jiǔ)**,\n   nine being **nine yangs (Jiǔ yáng)**,\n   so embracing Oneness cannot be abandoned.\n\n   The *Fire Record (Huǒ Jì)* says:\n   *\"Heaven has symbols—**sun, moon, and stars**;\n   Earth has symbols—**water, fire, and metal (jīn)**.\n   Though the moon is metal,\n   where is its form?\n   It is the **qi of the west**.\n   **Shén Hé Zǐ** says:\n   *\"The west lacks the **original qi of metal (yuán)** borrowed from the east,\n   the north’s **qi** is **water**,\n   water also has no form,\n   the south’s **qi** is **fire**,\n   fire also has no **symbol**.\n   These are **true water and true fire**.\"*\n\n   Therefore, the *Immortal Classic (Xiān Jīng)* says:\n   *\"Black Lead is the **Water Tiger (shuǐ hǔ)**,\n   the root of Heaven and Earth’s subtle transformations,\n   without substance yet with **qi**.\n   Red Lead is the **Fire Dragon (huǒ lóng)**,\n   the **qi** of Heaven and Earth’s subtle transformations arising,\n   with **qi** yet without substance.\n   Indeed, humans with their **substantial bodies (yǒuxíng zhī qū)**,\n   emptying their **One Heart (yī xīn)**,\n   seize Heaven and Earth’s natural **qi**,\n   extract **metal** from the moon,\n   and interchange **water and fire**.\n   When **water and fire** refine **metal**,\n   the **Elixir (Dān)** is formed.\n   Thus, one knows that the **Dao** is the **substance of yin and yang (tǐ)**,\n   and the One is the **origin of water and fire (yuán)**.\n\n   The **Qián** essence is **metal (jīn)**,\n   sustained by **fire** for nourishment.\n   To seize its **qi**, one must not abandon the One.\n   The **moon’s initial birth** is the **arcane (pò)**,\n   without the **hun** (ethereal soul) it lacks clarity,\n   the **hun** being **fire**,\n   without embracing Oneness it is insufficient to capture the **sun’s qi (Tài yáng zhī qì)**.\n   Again, **metal and water** must be balanced and complete.\n\n   Now, instead of speaking of **water**, we speak of **fire**,\n   invoking the **sun** as **water**.\n\n   The *Fire Record* says:\n   *\"Stars arise from **sun and moon**,\n   **metal** is formed from **water and fire**.\n   Therefore, we rely on the **three luminaries (sān guāng)** for illumination.\n   The **Dao’s** application is not merely to obtain **symbols (xiàng)**;\n   even if one attains them, one must forget their forms—\n   this is its mystery.\"*\n\n2. **Guard against joy and anger.**\n   Concentrate the **qi** to achieve **softness (róu)**,\n   can one be like an infant?\n\n   The One is the **yang’s initial birth**.\n   Like a child in the womb,\n   it is guarded by **softness (róu)**,\n   hence called **concentrating the qi**.\n   The saying *\"listen to it with the qi\"* is the **Dao** of this.\n\n   The *Classic* says:\n   *\"Continuous as if it exists,\n   yet used without exertion.\n   This is the **Dao** of concentrating the **qi**.\"*\n\n   Indeed, the **yang’s** initial birth is marked by **rigidity (gāngxìng)**,\n   and one must be cautious at its beginning.\n   During the **returning phase (fāng fù)**, concentrate on **softness** to govern it;\n   as it gradually strengthens, **rigidity** grows.\n   If overdone, the **center is lost**,\n   and this is the method of achieving it.\n\n   *\"Achieving\"* means *\"taking.\"*\n   Taking **softness** to govern **rigidity**,\n   one must not lose the **harmony (hé)**.\n\n   After the full moon, **metal and water** are balanced.\n   The **upper crescent** is like a taut string—\n   straight and unyielding.\n   One must not deviate or overpower it.\n   **Harmony** arises from **nature (xìng)**,\n   nature and **emotion (qíng)** merging,\n   forming the **Dao of yin and yang**.\n\n   When **metal** receives **fire**,\n   its **substance** transforms into **Qián** (creativity),\n   **Qián** shifts to **Xùn** (wind),\n   and the **five phases** complete their cycle,\n   returning to **Kūn** (receptivity).\n   The five can nourish the One,\n   and the **mother establishes the foundation (mǔ lì pín jī)**.\n\n   The *Classic* says:\n   *\"Thus, the noble one seeks nourishment from the mother,\n   and one must not fail to concentrate on **softness**—\n   hence, like an infant without **stumbling or violence (jué bào)**.\"*\n\n3. **Profoundly understand the emptiness of forms.**\n   Purify and eliminate, observe the **mystery (xuán)**—\n   can one remain without flaw?\n\n   When the **heart (xīn)** transforms into **nature (xìng)**,\n   desires and utilitarian emotions vanish,\n   yet **nature** is hidden while the **heart** generates **delusive thoughts (wàng xiǎng)**.\n   These thoughts cling to **impurities (tú)**,\n   accumulating like sediment at the bottom.\n\n   To exhaust the **Dao’s** essence,\n   one must deeply inspect **Heaven’s mechanisms (tiān jī)**.\n   As long as external phenomena are not forgotten,\n   **evil thoughts (xié xīn)** will prevail.\n\n   Indeed, the **Great Dao** is attained through an **empty heart**,\n   thereby grasping **Heaven’s mechanisms**—\n   this is **pure and clear**, and **illuminated**.\n\n   Originally, the One arises from **non-generation (wúshēng)**,\n   not solidifying yet without means to conceal its **mystery**.\n   The **Qián** phase must derive from **Kūn** through **enlightenment (zhì chè)**,\n   and only then can one perceive the **subtle words of the Dao (wēi jù)**,\n   the **obscured desires (xī yù zhī hūn)**,\n   and the **dimness of lustful reasoning (lì yù zhī chǎn)**.\n\n   The two characters *\"purify and eliminate\"* emphasize **excavating the heart**.\n   The **function of observing the mystery** requires first forgetting oneself,\n   so that **water flows freely**,\n   the **sea’s clarity** reflects the **sky’s vastness**,\n   and **spirit is renewed like snow after a bath**.\n   **Dispelling delusion** and **clarifying the ultimate (shū míng jiù jìng)**,\n   one cannot observe the **mystery** without **Dao**,\n   and follows only the **Dao**.",

      "translated_text": "King Zhìrán said: *\"To bear the **spirit-soul** (*yíngpò*) until this is called **mystic virtue/power**.*\n\nThe **Perfect Person** (*zhìrén*) takes **embracing one’s innate nature** and **harboring the spirit** as the sequence of entering the **Dao/Way**, and **stillness** and **non-action** as the application of embodying the **Dao/Way**.\n\nNow, to bear the **spirit-soul** (*yíngpò*)—its **substance** is **yin-stillness**, its **function** is **gentle submission**. To **control** and **guide** it properly requires the **yang-spirit** (*hún*) as its complement. The **spirit-soul** (*pò*) depends on form to achieve stillness, yet cannot move on its own. The **spirit** (*hún*) rides the form to move, yet cannot still itself. Their **separation** and **union** occur naturally, with the **spirit** (*shén*) as their sovereign—just as a chariot needs wheels. Though the hub and spokes are present, how could it move without a **chariot**? When the **chariot** is not in use, yet when it is used, for an instant it cannot be separated from it.\n\nThus, it is said: *‘Can one embrace the One without separation?’*\n\nLet us examine this: **Spirit** not unified is called **emptiness** (*wǎng*), **essence** not unified is called **duality** (*liǎng*). From **things** one falls into **emptiness-duality**—what **spirituality** remains?\n\nIndeed, because humans with life do not understand this **Dao/Way**, they lose their own **spirituality**. By the time they begin to move their hands and feet, their **essence** dissipates, their **spirit-soul** (*húnpò*) drifts away. The **spirit** (*hún*) must scatter with **perception** into the void, while the **spirit-soul** (*pò*) sinks with the corpse into the earth. All fail to return to their **true nature**—this cannot be compared to the saying of **stillness as returning to one’s original nature**.\n\nShī Jiānwú said: *\"When **essence** abides, **qi** abides; when **qi** abides, **spirit** departs.\"* **Zhuāngzǐ** said: *\"When **essence** is complete, **qi** is complete; when **qi** is complete, **spirit** is complete; when **spirit** is complete, the **Dao/Way** is complete.\"* When these three are complete, it is called **restoring form and essence**, **unifying form and spirit**, all perfectly aligning with the **Dao/Way**. Yet those who long for **true heart-mind** and **resolve**—why do they not naturally emit **heavenly radiance**?\n\nThere are those with the **heart** to learn the **Dao/Way** but lacking the **nature** to learn it; there are those with the **nature** to learn the **Dao/Way** but lacking the **heart** to learn it. Those who fear what they lose have already lost the **root** of **calming the heart** and **nurturing nature**.\n\nThus, **Lǎozǐ** posed the question: *\"Can you concentrate your **qi** and soften like an infant? Can you keep **joy** and **anger** from showing on your face, **likes** and **dislikes** from entering your heart? When all **phenomena** confront you, you forget them—no dust of **attachment** arises. What **flaws** remain?*\n\nThe **body** is like a **state**; the **state** is like the **body**. One has never heard of the **body** being governed yet the **state** not governed, or the **state** governed yet the **body** not governed. It begins with **action** and ends with **non-action**. Though externally one may be indifferent to the **outcomes of action**, internally one must preserve the **root of non-action**.\n\nThus, it is said: *‘To love the people and govern the state—can one do so without non-action?’*\n\nThe *Great Clinging* (*Dà Yì*) takes **Heaven** and **Earth** as gateways; the **valley-spirit** (*gǔshén*) takes the **mysterious female** (*xiánpò*) as its gateway. **Heaven** and **Earth**, **yin** and **yang**—their **rolling**, **unfolding**, **opening**, and **closing**, their **emerging**, **entering**, **expanding**, and **contracting**—never fail their **timing**.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Nourishing the Vital Essence**\n\nMaster Yinyuan, whose profound virtue traverses the Mysterious Path, oversees the compilation of affairs.\nSifu Liu Weiyong assembles the text.\nFormerly honored official Ding Yidong, Director of the Imperial Treasury and Compiler of the Secretariat, verifies the text.\n\n**On Nourishing the Vital Essence:**\n\nHuang Maocai says:\n*\"Can one who nourishes the vital essence and embraces unity ever separate?\"*\n**Vital essence**—this is motion.\n**Spirit**—this is yin.\nYin belongs to form; form, by nature, cannot move. Yet **qi** bears it and sets it in motion.\nWhen a person cultivates and directs **qi** so it never departs from form, this is called *embracing unity*.\nIt is not spoken of as **qi** because only this can sustain life—there is no second way.\n\n**Concentrating qi to achieve softness—can one be like an infant?**\nHaving embraced unity, over time one naturally forgets form and focuses solely on nurturing **qi**, hence form is not mentioned. What ordinary people contend for is the burden of form.\nTo forget one’s form and return to the state of an infant means no breath of strife remains—thus it is called *achieving softness*.\nSoftness is the companion of life.\n\n**Purifying and gazing into the Mysterious—can one be without blemish?**\nBy this stage, both form and **qi** are forgotten.\nWashing the heart clean, exhausting all filth, equal to the boundless void—how could there still be blemish?\n\n**Loving the people and governing the state—can one act without doing?**\nTo study the Dao and reach *wuwei* is not the work of a single day.\nOnly after embracing unity, achieving softness, and gazing into the Mysterious without blemish can one attain *wuwei*.\nIf one has not yet reached this and yet forces oneself to *wuwei*, this is called *riding at a gallop*—ever more distant from the Dao.\nThe state is like the body; the people are like the spirit. Loving the people and governing the state is the same as tending to oneself.\n\n**The Heavenly Gate opening and closing—can one avoid the feminine?**\nThe Heavenly Gate is the **fontanel**.\nNow, the infant’s fontanel opens and closes uncontrollably. When cultivation reaches this stage, one can ascend to communicate with Heavenly Dao—thus it is called the Heavenly Gate.\n**Feminine** is the same as **yin**.\n\n**Clarity and openness in all directions—can one avoid knowing?**\nTo be without knowing is to know all things, like a person opening their eyes to see—nothing is unseen.\nHow could one say, *\"I have perception\"*? To have perception and lack perception is called *eye disease*.\nTo have knowing and not knowing is called *heart disease*.\nFrom embracing unity, six stages progress until one reaches *wuwei*—thus, Kexue questioned Wangni four times, and four times Wangni answered, *\"I do not know.\"* Kexue then leapt for joy—there was good reason.\n\n**To nurture life to this point is called Mysterious Virtue.**\nThe Classic speaks of this twice.\nThe first mention refers to the **Dao**; this refers to **virtue**.\nThe **Dao** descends as **virtue**; the subtlest **virtue** merges once more with the **Dao**—thus it is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\nProgram Tai said:\n*\"Can one who nourishes the vital essence and embraces unity ever separate?\"*\nUnity is the name that encompasses all things.\nWhen joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are about to emerge but have not yet formed,\nWhen wisdom and insight are about to manifest but have not yet taken shape—\nAll these are unified into One, refined and without separation, returning to the origin where the **Dao** first emerges as One.\nThe **Dao** is One alone.\nTo ground the **Dao** in affairs and name what can be called **virtue** is already distinct from the **Dao**.\nFrom the **virtue** one attains, one divides it into *ren, yi, li, zhi, xin* to name it—\nThe source grows distant, and the branches multiply beyond count.\nEarlier, it was spoken of as a unified whole; now it is divided into five, and their offspring are innumerable.\nThus, Laozi thins it out, saying:\n*\"When the **Dao** is lost, **virtue** arises; when **virtue** is lost, *ren, yi, li* arise.\"*\nWhen he says *\"lost,\"* he does not mean *gone*—\nRather, moving away from the root, the commandments multiply, ever more contrary to Unity.\nThus, what Laozi most treasures is the subtle, indistinct, and undifferentiated origin.\nYet Yi Yin, speaking of his attainment, places it in the realm of **virtue**, harmony, and accord.\nExamining beginning and end, all conform to Unity as their standard.\n\nLiezi’s theory is like a lost sheep with many paths:\n*\"Only by returning to Unity and merging can one avoid gain or loss.\"*\nZhuangzi says, *\"**Virtue** is the totality of what the **Dao** encompasses.\"*\nUnity is called *totality*; merging is called *returning*.\nBoth stem from the restoration of the Mandate—\nThus, cultivating the **Dao** must begin with embracing Unity.\n\nThe human spirit and **qi** are called *hun* and *po*.\nThe moon’s substance, which does not receive sunlight, is also called *po*.\nThis **vital essence** and **spirit** are the *young hun* and *po* paired in opposition from the *Yijing*.\nThe *young hun* can ascend and descend lightly, entering and exiting freely.\nBut the *po*’s **vital essence** is like encampment, gathering, and clustering—\nYet it is bound and constrained, unable to govern its own movement.\nThus, the ascent or descent of spirit and form is the most critical mechanism of the body.\nIf the spirit governs the form, all actions follow its will—\nIf the spirit does not reign, it is instead bent by the form, and decay follows.\nNow, let the spirit be the chariot, the form the load—\nThe chariot moves, and the load is borne upon it—\nThis is the spirit already governing the form.\nIf a person achieves this, their will directs the form like a chariot moving its load—\nDesire east, and it goes east; desire west, and it goes west—\nWhatever is willed, there is compliance, no resistance.\nTo embrace Unity from here is not difficult.\nIt is only that one does not know whether, in governing the form and embracing Unity, one can persist without abandoning it.\n\nThus, the hesitant tone—this is doubt.\nUsing doubtful language to examine the superficial—\nIt is to make one reflect upon themselves.\nHence, Zhuangzi’s discussion of the *Yashengjing* says:\n*\"Can one embrace Unity? Can one avoid loss?\"*\nThis is the very meaning.\n\nAll this chapter speaks to those who have glimpsed the **Dao** but whose guardianship is not yet firm.\nIf one embraces Unity and does not separate,\nAchieves softness and is like an infant—\nThen one is already One with the **Dao**.\nIf Laozi were to speak from this ground,\nThe doubtful language would become decisive.",

      "translated_text": "「凡此章下文设疑以示者，其义皆类此也。\nTo embrace Unity and achieve softness—can one persist like a newborn babe? The *Liezi* describes the infant thus: *\"Qi is focused and harmonized to its utmost.\"*\nNothing harms it, no virtue can surpass it—this speaks of its innate thickness, untainted by external things.\nMencius says: *\"The noble person is one who does not lose the heart of their infant self.\"*\nThis means though they engage with the world, they do not forget their original nature.\n\nCombining both, only those whose virtue remains unseparated can truly return to the state of the infant.\nWhen one is about to act, their *qi* carries out their intentions as if wind conveys the chill and heat of seasons.\nIf one’s *qi* is not diverted elsewhere, and they focus solely on achieving softness,\nThen when this softness is attained, the harmonized state that harms nothing returns once more.\nIt is only that one does not know whether they can reach this state.\n\nTo purify and perceive the profound—can one remain without flaw?\nThe profound is that which is deep and unfathomable.\n*Xuànpín* (玄牝), *Xuàndé* (玄德), *Xuàntóng* (玄同), and *Xuànguān* (玄览) all describe this unfathomable realm.\nTo perceive the profound is to gaze within the dark and see the luminous.\nThis kind of perception, all have it—yet if the heart’s source is unclean,\nAnd one’s mind wanders with external things,\nThen the senses are obscured, and how can the luminous be seen?\n\nNánróng Zī asked Laozi: *\"What is the difference between the eye and its form?\nYet the blind cannot see themselves.\"*\nLaozi briefly illuminated the nature of innate disposition and emotions to awaken him,\nAnd Zī thus retreated to his dwelling, called forth what he loved,\nAnd banished what he hated—\nAfter ten days, he returned to see Laozi.\nLaozi praised his ability to purify himself.\n\nZī’s question concerned vision, yet what Laozi taught was about innate disposition and emotions.\nIf Zī could purify his disposition and emotions,\nThen the obscurations would vanish on their own, and he would recover his original nature.\nThus, to purify and perceive the profound is not to exert oneself upon the eyes.\nTo investigate why obscurations arise and then purify them,\nThen all that can be seen and known will return to its original state.\nReturning to the original, one’s perception of the profound will be restored.\n\nTo love the people and govern the state—can one act without doing?\nLoving the people and governing the state must involve means to execute,\nAnd only then can intentions bear fruit—\nYet all establishing laws and affairs are but these means.\nIf one has means yet still warns against deliberate action,\nZhuangzi has already made this clear.\nHe said: *\"I have heard of nurturing the world, but never of governing it.\"*\nIn the way of nurturing, one discards cleverness,\nSets aside rewards and punishments,\nFollows the natural flow of life and disposition,\nAnd finds ease in effortless harmony—\nThus, all things are not burdened.\n\nThere is one who transcends the rules and measures of law and order.\nThis is what is called *wuwei* (无为).\n\nThus, those who strive to follow the established ways cannot,\nAnd those who seek governance through deliberate action often fail in many matters.\nHence, the warning here is like asking: *\"Who can love the people and govern the state\nWithout resorting to contrived schemes and actions?\"*\nTo act in accordance with nature, without deliberate intervention,\nIs the very essence of the next chapter’s governance—\nAs vast as simmering fresh meat.\n\nThe opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate—can one avoid bias?\nZhuangzi once pointed to the realm of birth and death, existence and nonexistence,\nAs the Heavenly Gate—\nThis is the Heavenly Gate of Heaven.\nHe also discussed the Dao that cannot be spoken or transmitted:\n*\"If one’s heart rejects it, the Heavenly Gate will not open.\"*\nThis also speaks of the human heart as the Heavenly Gate.\n\nSince the Heavenly Gate of Heaven is the realm of birth and transformation,\nThen the human Heavenly Gate is also the passage of their innate vitality.\nThe Creator’s contraction and expansion of yin and yang,\nTheir successive nurturing of birth and transformation,\nIs the ability to regulate the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate.\nIf one’s engagement with the world is cautious,\nPreserving life and death through moderation,\nJudging what is appropriate and welcoming or rejecting accordingly,\nThen the Heavenly Gate of one’s self\nCan also regulate its opening and closing.\n\nCultivating to this degree is already to surpass the world and reveal its essence—\nYet to act only when appropriate, never leading the way of things,\nIs not this even more excellent?\n\nClarity and openness in all directions—can one avoid knowing?\nClarity means no obstruction, whiteness means no darkness.\nTo be open in all directions is to have no closed doors or blind spots—\nAll four ways are thoroughly illuminated.\nThe distant lies beyond the eight extremes,\nThe near is within the space between one’s eyebrows—\nIf there is a distinct sound that comes to disturb me,\nI must know it—\nThis is the clarity and openness that reaches in all directions.\n\nWhen one attains this state, the danger lies in being too sharp in applying wisdom.\nWithout affairs, one becomes overly observant;\nEncountering affairs, one becomes too probing.\nYet if one has attained the Dao, this is not so.\nThey have never deliberately sought to see—\nYet seeing arises from the things themselves.\nThe wisdom of divining from tortoise shells,\nThe clarity of the water mirror,\nAre all its manifestations.\n\nIf one’s cultivation has not yet reached this state,\nThen even with keen intelligence and sharp insight,\nThey may guard it with foolishness—\nCould one not expose their own nature?\n\nTo nurture and accumulate life.\nOriginally, there is nothing—yet through creation, something arises—\nThus, it can be called *shēng* (生).\nLike the Dao giving rise to Unity, and Unity to Duality.\nTo take what has already been born and solidify it,\nIs to *chù* (畜) it.\nAs when one cultivates their virtue.\n\nNearly all the teachings in this chapter,\nFrom embracing Unity and achieving softness onward,\nAre about holding fast to virtue and seeking to return to the Dao.\nThe pursuit of Unity, softness, and elemental clarity is through virtue—\nTo hope for no separation and no flaw is to seek return to the Dao.\nThe methods of focusing *qi* and purifying obscurations,\nAre all ways to attain virtue.\nIf one attains virtue, one can nurture life—\nUnity, softness, and elemental clarity—\nDo they come to me?\nIf they dwell, then I am the one who can accumulate them.»",

bestows upon me,\nYet expects no recompense in return.\nLengthen yet do not cut short—\nIt lengthens and completes me,\nThus no harm comes to me.\nThis is called *Xuándé* (玄德, \"Mysterious Virtue\").\nSo it is said: \"With virtue, one's Dao/Way is naturally fulfilled.\"\n\nChén Bìxū said:\nTo bear and nurture *pò* (魄) while embracing *yī* (一, \"Oneness\"),\nCan one remain undivided?\n\nThe Daoists say the Yang spirit is called *hún* (魂, \"Corporeal Soul\"),\nAnd the *hún* delights in life.\nThe *Yīnguǐ* (陰鬼, \"Yin Ghost\") is called *pò* (魄),\nAnd the *pò* prefers death.\nThe *hún* wanders, the *pò* remains still.\n*The Bái Hǔ Tóng* (白虎通, \"White Tiger Discourses\") says:\n*The hún* is like clouds—\n*Yíng* (營, \"Ethereal Soul\") is the restless, unsettled form.\nThus, the *hún* is called *yíng*.\nThe old sayings state:\n\"To bear\" means \"to ride,\" and *yíng* is the *hún*.\nIt is also said that *yíng* protects the Yang *qi*.\nNow, the *hún* is the Yang Essence,\nThe *pò* is the Yin Spirit.\nThe Yang Essence thrives on movement and dissipation,\nThus Daoist texts have methods to restrain and retain it.\nThe Yin Spirit is prone to confusion and disturbance,\nThus Daoist texts have laws to subdue and control it.\nIf one’s form constantly rides the Yang Essence and Yin Spirit,\nEmbracing and guarding the pure, harmonious *Tàihé* (太和, \"Great Harmony\") *qi*,\nSo that it does not scatter or separate,\nThen one will forever preserve longevity.\n\nThe Daoist practice of embracing *yī* (一, \"Oneness\")\nIs like a mirror containing clarity—\nClarity does not separate from the mirror.\nThis teaching is about nurturing the spirit.\nNow I explain:\n\"Can one remain undivided?\" is the Master Lao’s questioning tone,\nLike asking, \"Can one uphold the precepts?\"\nNow, if one wishes to practice the art of embracing *yī*,\nOne must be able to keep the mind undivided.\nIf one can keep the mind undivided,\nThen one is riding the *hún* and *pò*,\nEmbracing the pure, harmonious Dao/Way.\n\nCan one be like an infant?\nAll the following points are explained with this meaning.\n\nTo focus the *qi* and attain softness—\nCan one be like an infant?\nThe old sayings state:\n\"To focus\" means \"to be one\" and \"to entrust.\"\n*Qi* is the *Chōnghé miàoqì* (沖和妙氣, \"Unifying and Harmonious Marvelous *Qi*\"),\nAlso the natural *qi*.\nA person stands alone, transformed by nature,\nReceiving the natural, unifying, harmonious marvelous *qi*.\nAs the *qi* descends and the form is born,\nIt remains untainted and pure.\nIf one entrusts to the unifying marvelous *qi*,\nForgets all knowledge and perception,\nAllows the *qi* to naturally purify and harmonize,\nAnd the form to naturally soften and weaken—\nUnharmed by all evil,\nThis is attaining the complete harmony of an infant.\nThis teaching is about nurturing the *qi*.\n\nNow I explain:\n\"Can one be like an infant?\" means,\nWhen one desires to focus the *qi* and attain softness,\nCan one be like an infant in pure harmony?\nIf one can be like an infant in pure harmony,\nThen one has attained the art of focusing the *qi* and attaining softness.\n\nTo wash away and transcend the subtle and profound—\nCan one be without flaw?\nThe old sayings state:\n\"To wash away\" means \"to cleanse.\"\n\"To transcend\" means \"to dispel\" and \"to regulate.\"\n*Xuánlǎn* (玄覽, \"Subtle Perception\") is the illumination of the mind.\n*Cī* (疵, \"flaw\") refers to imperfections and diseases.\nA person should cleanse dust and filth,\nDispel the Five *Emotions* (五情),\nInner and outer emptiness and clarity,\nThe mind illuminated over all things—\nImperfections and diseases do not arise.\nThis teaching is about cultivating the heart.\n\nFrom these three matters above,\nIt concerns oneself in cultivating the body.\nFrom these three matters below,\nIt encourages governing the realm.\nThe Classic says:\n\"Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue is true.\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.\"\n\nNow I explain:\n\"Can one be without flaw?\" means,\nWhen one desires to cleanse the heart and dispel impurities,\nTo introspect all inner and outer matters,\nOne must be able to self-examine,\nTo have no flaws or imperfections.\nIf one can have no flaws or imperfections,\nThen one has attained the method of washing away and transcending the subtle and profound.\n\nTo love the people and govern the realm—\nCan one be without action?\nThe old sayings state:\n\"To love the people\" means to love them as one’s own children,\nIn governing, one must not be harsh or cruel,\nTaxes and labor must not harm their nature.\n\"To govern the realm\" means to focus on agriculture and simplify matters,\nAllowing the people to pursue their vocations and live in peace—\nThis is the transformation of *Wuwéi* (無為, \"Non-action\").\n\nNow I explain:\n\"Can one be without action?\" means,\nWhen a ruler desires to love and nurture all people,\nTo not harm their natural inclinations,\nTo govern by focusing on agriculture,\nTo avoid unnecessary complexity,\nOne must be able to remain calm, clear, and without action.\nIf one can remain calm, clear, and without action,\nThen one has attained the art of loving the people and governing the realm.\n\nThe *Tiānmén* (天門, \"Heavenly Gate\") opens and closes—\nCan one be without duality?\n*The Tiānmén*

      "translated_text": "「Opening refers to *sànshī* (散施, \"dissemination and giving\"), closing to *xīlǐn* (歙敛, \"withdrawal and restraint\"). When the gate opens, all things flourish; when it closes, they wither and perish. Though it generates myriad beings, one does not see its *shēngshēng* (生生, \"life-giving life\"); though it destroys all things, one does not see its *sǐsǐ* (死死, \"death-dealing death\"). Life and death proceed through this gate unseen—is this not called *natural* (自然)?\n\nThose who embody *natural* (自然) are none other than the *Dàrén* (大人, \"Great Person\"). The *Dàrén* measures the cosmos with their breadth, their *qi* (氣) encompasses Yin and Yang. When they act with *qīngjìng* (清静, \"serene stillness\") and *wéijìng* (雌静, \"receptive quietude\"), the cycles of life and death, flourishing and decline, do not enter their mind.\n\n*Wéijìng* (雌静) is the subtle *mystic application* (妙用) of *natural* (自然). For those who cultivate the self and govern the realm, they must always uphold *wéijìng* (雌静) as their principle.\n\nThe old saying explains:\n*The Tiānmén* (天門) is the gate of the *Zǐgōng* (紫宫, \"Purple Palace\") at the *Beǐjī* (北极, \"North Pole\"). In the heavens, the *Beǐjī* (北极星, \"North Pole Star\") resides within the *Zǐgōng* (紫宫). Within this palace, the *Wǔdì* (五帝, \"Five Emperors\") succeed one another in their reigns of rest and rule (*xiūwáng* 休王), thus the gate has opening and closing.\n\nWhen it opens, it aligns with *Tài* (泰, \"Harmony\"); when it closes, it aligns with *Pǐ* (否, \"Disharmony\"). Hence, in spring, the *Qīngdì* (青帝, \"Green Emperor\")’s gate opens while the others close. Such is the example of the four seasons, and likewise, the *Wǔyùn* (五运, \"Five Phases/Processes\") of completion and renewal, the shifts in *lìshù* (历数, \"cosmic cycles\") and their rise and fall—these are not constant. Only the *sage* (圣人) knows *Tian* (天, \"Heaven\") and *Mìng* (命, \"Fate\"), perpetually guarding *wéijìng* (雌静) and *qiānxìa* (谦下, \"humble receptivity\"), thus they are not swayed by change. Therefore, they attain *Yǒnghéng Yuánjí* (永亨元吉, \"eternal prosperity and primal auspiciousness\").\n\nSome discuss this in terms of self-cultivation: *Tiānmén* (天門) refers to the nose and mouth. Opening and closing mean *chuǎnxī* (喘息, \"breathing\") and *hūxī* (呼吸, \"respiration\"). When one embodies *wéijìng* (雌静) and *róuhé* (柔和, \"gentle harmony\"), their breath becomes deep and expansive, continuous and subtle, nurturing their *spirit* (精神) into *tiánrán* (恬然, \"tranquil repose\"), free and effortless.\n\nNow I explain:\nThose who can practice *wéijìng* (雌静) speak of the *Tiānmén* (天門) opening and closing in rest and rule (*xiūwáng* 休王)—this is the constant of *lìshù* (历数). Only those who guard *wéijìng* (雌静) and *qiānxìa* (谦下) can thus prevent Yin and Yang from altering them, nor can cold and heat change them.\n\n*Míng* (明, \"illumination\") and *Sìdá* (四达, \"fourfold penetration\")—can one truly be without knowing (*wúzhī* 能无知)?\n\nThe old saying explains:\n*Míng* (明) means *huìzhào* (慧照, \"wise illumination\"). For self-cultivation, even with a mind of *huìzhào* (慧照), one’s *cleverness* (聪明) and *Sìdá* (通达) should be as though without perception or hearing. In governance, one’s *virtue* (德) should be *míngbái* (明白, \"clear and luminous\"), like the sun and moon’s radiance, penetrating the four seas. Yet, one must block their *cleverness* (塞聪) and obscure their *illumination* (蔽明), achieving *wúzhī* (无知, \"non-knowing\") so that the people of the world live their daily lives unaware—this is called *having the Dao* (有道).\n\nNow I explain:\nThose who seek *zhìhuì míngbái* (智慧明白, \"wise illumination\") and *Sìdá* (四达) must first practice *shōushì fǎn tīng* (收视反听, \"withdrawing sight and inverting hearing\"). Only then can they perpetually uphold *wúzhī* (无知). If one attains *wúzhī* (无知), then it is the *source* (原) of *wise illumination* (智慧明白) and *fourfold penetration* (四达).\n\nTo *nurture* (畜) life is the ultimate *Xuándé* (玄德, \"mystic virtue\"). It means that in cultivating the self and governing the realm, one can enact the six affairs above—like the Dao’s *shēngwù* (生物, \"life-giving\"), not obstructing its source, allowing it to flourish naturally; or *virtue’s* (德) *yǎngwù* (养物, \"nurturing beings\"), not restraining their nature, preserving their innate essence.\n\nThe myriad things arise singularly—does the *sage* (圣人) not rely on them? All classes pursue their own endeavors—does the *sage* (圣人) depend on them? Moreover, things grow and nourish themselves—where does the *sage* (圣人) preside over them? This is the *forgetting merit and forgetting things* (忘功忘物), penetrating the *míngjí* (冥极, \"profound depths\"), called *yuāndé* (渊德, \"abyssal virtue\").\n\n*Wang Bi* (王弼) says:\n*Yuāndé* (渊德) is *having virtue without knowing its master* (有德而不知其主), emerging from the *yōumíng* (幽冥, \"mysterious darkness\").\n\n*Xiè Túnán* (谢图南) says:\n*To bear the spirit and the vital force* (载营魄) until there is no separation (*wúlí* 无离).\n\nThe *Shū* (书, *Book of Documents*) says:\n*\"O! the spirit is born\"* (哉生魄), pointing to the sixteenth day of the month. After the *jìwàng* (既望, \"full moon\"), the *spirit* (魄) is born as the *light* (明) dies, marking the initial growth of *Yin* (阴).\n\nIn a person’s body, the *soul* (魂) is *Yang* (阳), while the *vital force/spirit* (魄) is *Yin* (阴). When *Yin* (阴) is growing, the *vital force/spirit* (魄) is restless and strives forward, yet if one guards *unity* (一) without separation, they will not be overcome by *Yin* (阴).\n\n*Unity* (一) is the *Xuán* (玄, \"mystic\") of Heaven, the *Yang* (阳). Applied to the realm, it means that the *small people* (小人) cannot overcome the *gentlemen* (君子), for they share the same Dao.\n\n*Concentrating qi to achieve softness* (专气致柔)—can one be like an *infant* (婴儿)?\n\n*Huáng Shígōng* (黄石公) says:\n*Softness can overcome hardness* (柔能胜刚), *weakness can overcome strength* (弱能胜强). The *method of nourishing the body* (沁养身之道) takes *softness* (柔) as its foundation. If one’s *qi* (氣) is not concentrated, then the *strong and violent Yang* (强暴之阳) will exploit it. One must be like an *infant* (婴儿) before they are *cháibéi* (孩, \"childlike\"), the ultimate of *softness* (柔). Human desires, if many, will surely be controlled by the *strong Yang* (强阳)—this must be guarded against.\n\n*Washing away and penetrating the mysterious* (涤除玄览)—can one be without *flaws* (疵)?\n\nThe *classic* (经) says:\n*\"Though the sage may have splendid dwellings, their repose is lofty and detached\"* (圣人虽有荣观，燕处超然). This is the meaning of *Xuánlǎn* (玄览, \"mystic penetration\").\n\n*垂旒蔽目* (Chuíliú bìmù, \"hanging tassels to blind the eyes\") means not desiring one’s eyes to engage with external things. Engaging externally with things, one’s internal mind follows suit. The way of cultivating the self is to *not see what is desirable* (不见可欲), so the mind does not stray. Washing away the external, one’s vision aligns with *Xuánwéi* (玄微, \"mystic subtleties\"). To be without *flaws* (疵) means that human desires cannot intrude upon Heavenly principle (*Tiānlǐ* 天理).\n\n*Loving the people and governing the realm* (爱民治国)—can one be without action (*wúwéi* 能无为)?\n\nCultivating the self is the foundation for governing the realm.

that one may become a person who exhausts principles and fulfills nature*—*\nbetween heaven and earth,\nthey can avoid great errors.\nHow could they be called flawed?\n\nThe vulgar speak of the \"Heavenly Heart\" as a mirror—\nwithout cleansing, it cannot be clear;\nthe Dao/Way is like a shadow—\nwithout observation, it cannot be seen.\n\nThus, the Dao/Way scholar always cultivates and reflects,\nwithout any interruption,\nso that their *virtue/power* remains luminous\nand is not obscured by cravings.\n\nLike a person bathing once a day—\nor bathing daily,\nnever ceasing their bathing,\nif their cleansing and purifying rituals are uninterrupted,\nthen their body remains pristine and clear,\nnot stained by past impurities,\nand their mirror reflects without dust,\ntheir

the foundation of the state;\nif the foundation is secure, the state is at peace.\nThus, one who governs the state must first love the people,\nand the way to love the people is through *non-action*.\n*Non-action* means not to obstruct.\n\nAs in the past, when Tang Taizong once told his attendants:\n*\"The ruler depends on the state,\nthe state depends on the people.\nIf you exploit the people to serve the ruler,\nit is like cutting flesh to fill the belly.\nThe belly may be full while the body dies,\nthe ruler may grow rich while the state perishes.\nThus, the ruler’s misfortune does not come from without,\nbut arises from within.\"*\n\nAfterward, he lightened taxes and burdens,\nselected capable officials.\nFrom then on, the empire flourished in peace,\npeople had abundant clothing and food,\nouter doors remained open,\nand travelers lodged freely in the wilds.\nIs this not the saying of loving the people and governing the state\nthrough *non-action* and non-obstruction?\n\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate*—\ncould there be any imbalance?\n\nThe *Heavenly Gate* is the mouth.\nTruly, the mouth is the gateway of the body—\nthe head round as heaven,\nso the mouth is called the *Heavenly Gate*.\n\n*Opening and closing* refers to breathing,\n*imbalance* means the lack of harmony between yin and yang.\n\nTruly, opening and

static—\nmutually their roots.\nOne yin, one yang—\nthis is called the Dao/Way.\nThose who follow it are good.\"*\n\nWho could have inhalation without exhalation?\nWho could have stillness without movement?\nThus, it is said: *The Heavenly Gate opens and closes—*\ncould there be any imbalance?\n\n*The True Definition Scripture* states:\n*\"Two movements constitute yin,\none stillness constitutes yang.\nYang alone brings variation,\nyin alone maintains constancy.\nUnderstanding constancy and awakening to clarity,\nembracing unity and resonating with the spirit*—*\nthe interplay of *kan* and *li* is fixed,\ntransformation and change occur naturally.\"*\n\nThis discusses the balance of yin and yang,\nmovement and stillness.\nThus, it is said: *The Heavenly Gate opens and closes—*\ncould there be any imbalance?\n\nClear and penetrating, fourfold and boundless—\ncould there be any ignorance?\n\n*Clear* means keen perception.\n*White* means bright sensitivity.\n*Boundless* means thoroughness.\n\nA person with keen perception and bright sensitivity,\nwhose understanding is fourfold and boundless,\ncan know the world without stepping outside their door,\ncan see the Dao/Way without peering through windows.\nWho would call them ignorant?\n\n*Knowledge* means the ability to perceive the four directions,\nconsult the four cardinal officials,\nand understand the four kinds of people.\nOnly a ruler who is clear and boundless\ncan truly know them.\n\nAs with Yao’s opening of the four gates,\nilluminating the four eyes,\nand attuning the four ears—\nthis is the case.\n\nA ruler of the world,\nusing the four directions’ ears as their own,\nnot hoarding their ears,\ncan thus communicate the world’s intentions\nand grasp the world’s emotions.\n\nUsing the four directions’ eyes as their own,\nnot hoarding their eyes,\nthen the world’s clarity becomes their own clarity.\nThus, their vision is never unreflective,\ntheir hearing is never unperceptive.\nWho would call them ignorant?\nThis is the meaning of *clear and boundless*.\n\nTo nurture and sustain life—\nto generate without possessing generation,\nto sustain without claiming credit for nurturing.\n*Not possessing* means not taking ownership of the deed.\n\nTake heaven and earth, for instance—\nthey generate all things,\nyet all things never claim it as heaven’s and earth’s work.\nTake the sage, for instance—\nthe sage nurtures the world with benevolence,\nyet the world never credits it as the sage’s favor.\nIt is not that heaven and earth have no work,\nnor that the sage offers no benefits—\ntheir deeds are profound yet unmanifest,\ntheir benefits vast yet unapparent.\nThus, they receive the work without knowing its source,\nthey accept the benefits without feeling gratitude.\n\nHere, we see the grandeur of heaven, earth, and the sage.\nIf heaven, earth, and the sage had boasted of their work,\nthen it would not be called *generating without possessing*.\n\nThe *Scripture* says: *\"Heaven and earth lack virtue/power,\"*\nand again: *\"The sage lacks virtue/power.\"*\nThis is the saying of *generating without possessing*.\n\nTo act without relying—\nthis is what is called *Playen Virtue/Power*.\n\nThe sage is the most noble among people,\nyet they never rely on their nobility.\nTruly, the sage governs the world and directs customs,\ntransforming alone in the *Dao/Way’s* shaping*—*\nthey do not cling to lowly words,\nnor do they seize the common level of the multitude,\nthus they act without relying,\nthey grow without

essence suffer no fault of deviation.\nIf so, then in movement, they are one;\nin stillness, they are one.\nWherever one goes, it is not separate from this unity—\nhow could there be any separation?\n\nTo concentrate *qi* and cultivate softness—\ncan one attain the state of an infant?\nWhen *jing* (essence) is concentrated and *qi* is vast,\nreaching the utmost in softness and

grasp firm.\n\nTo purify and survey the mysteries—\ncan one remain without flaw?\n*Purification* means washing away one’s cravings and desires;\n*removal* means eliminating one’s likes and

people and govern the state—\ncan one truly avoid *wuwei* (inaction)?\n\nTo love the people and govern the state\nare two distinct matters.\nOne speaks of *wuwei* (inaction)—\nfor if a ruler loves the people through *wuwei*,\nthe people will be at ease;\nif a ruler governs the state through *wuwei*,\nthe state will be tranquil.\n*Wuwei* (inaction) is not passive silence or idle sitting—\nit means to benefit the people by what benefits them,\nso that love is vast;\nto govern the state by what the state requires,\nso that governance is grand.\nThis is true *wuwei*.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* (Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious) says:\n*\"Wuwei* means not acting before things have acted themselves.\"\nIt also says:\n*\"To follow is great; to act is petty.\"\nIf one seeks to love the people with small favors,\nor to govern the state with harsh laws and punishments,\nthen it is petty.\n\nAs for the *Heavenly Gate* opening and closing—\ncan one truly avoid *cī* (passivity/femininity)?\nThe *Heavenly Gate* is the great root of all under Heaven,\nthe source from which auspiciousness and inauspiciousness,\norder and chaos arise—\nthe natural doorway of creation and transformation.\nThe Dao has its passages of flow and blockage;\ntime has its *pǐ* (obstruction) and *tài* (harmony).\nThis is the natural principle of creation and transformation.\nJust as doors

*xióng* (masculine/forceful) or as leaders,\nand often see disaster.\n\nTo be clear and open in all directions—\ncan one truly avoid *zhī* (knowing)?\nA ruler is intelligent, well-informed, and knows all things—\nclear and open in every direction.\nIf one can conceal one’s knowledge,\nentrusting it to the worthy while receiving their abilities,\nupright and dignified, with sleeves drawn low,\nthen the state is governed without laboring the mind,\nlongevity is extended, and all under Heaven is in harmony.\nTo nurture and preserve life until it reaches its utmost—\nthen it is not slaughtered.\nA

possession.\nAll actions undertaken,\nwithout exception, are to benefit all under Heaven.\nWhen the work is accomplished and the affairs fulfilled,\none does not claim them as one’s own—\nthus, it is said to act without reliance.\nThe ruler is the leader of all the people.\nAs the leader of the people,\nyet issuing no commands to slaughter them—\nthe people know only of their ruler.\nThus, it is said: *\"Comfortably at ease\"*—\nhence, *\"long while not slaughtered.\"*\nThis is called *Xuān Dé* (Mysterious Virtue).\n*Xuān* is Heaven.\nIf a ruler cultivates himself thus,\nit is called

*non-attachment*.\n\nTo love the people and govern the state while acting through *wuwei* (non-action),\nthen clarity and stillness arise naturally,\nand the soul and vital essence may unite without separation—\nthis is *purity and clarity*.\n\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate*,\nthrough which *Heavenly Principle* emerges—\nwhen *yin* and *yang* interact in harmony,\nwhen *male* and *female* resonate together,\nwith principle present yet the mind absent,\nthen the soul and vital essence unite without separation—\nthis is *desirelessness*.\n\nTo be bright and far-reaching yet appear as if without knowledge or awareness,\nthen one conceals brilliance in obscurity,\nand the soul and vital essence may unite without separation—\nthis is *concealing brilliance*.\n\nIn essence, *purity and firmness*, *non-attachment*, *purity and clarity*,\n*desirelessness*, and *concealing brilliance*—\nthese five make the soul and vital essence naturally embrace unity.\nWhen the soul and vital essence embrace unity,\nthey become the source of *generative life*.\n\n*Heaven’s Dao* takes nurturing all things as its intent,\nyet especially cherishes humanity.\nTo give birth and nourish is *Heaven’s Dao*,\nyet if the soul and vital essence separate,\nlife cannot endure.\n*Laozi* teaches these five matters to humanity,\nwhile *Heaven and Earth’s* benevolent generation is boundless.\nYet *Heaven’s Dao* gives birth without possessing—\nhow could it claim credit for its generative power?\nIt acts without relying—\nhow could it boast of its deeds?\nThough it stands as sovereign over all things,\nit harbors no masterful intent—\nthis is called the *mysterious virtue*.\n\nTo take the unity of soul and vital essence as the root of generative life,\nand to possess without claiming, act without relying, govern without dominating,\nis to have no room for the mind.\nThe grace of giving birth and nourishing\nis shared equally by *Heaven* and the *Sage*—\nthus speaks *Ben Yi An*, the recluse of the *One Root Lodge*:\n*\"From ‘carrying the vital essence and soul’ to this point is called the *Mysterious Virtue*.\"*\n\nThe meaning of *soul* and *vital essence* has been thoroughly expounded by earlier scholars.\nIn my view, regarding the *Rites’* sacrificial rites, *Confucius* said:\n*\"The vital essence is the flourishing of the spirit.\"*\n*Zheng Xuan* annotated:\n*\"The vital essence is the luminous clarity of the ears and eyes.\"*\nThis is the most concise explanation.\n*Zhu Xi* said that *vital essence* (*ying*) is akin to *ying* (glowing),\nmeaning radiant brilliance—\nthus, *vital essence* and *soul* are the spiritual essence of the form.\nHuman form gives rise to spirit,\nand the luminous clarity of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth\nall originate from *One Nature*—\nwhat the *Buddhist School* calls *Elemental Essence*.\nIt divides into the six harmonized faculties from a single clarity—\nyet because it is drawn by external things,\nit drifts and forgets its return,\nthus the form decays externally while awareness falters internally,\nand suddenly, death comes.\nThe soul ascends, the vital essence descends—\nthey can no longer reunite.\nTo die without forgetting is difficult indeed.\n\nThus, the enlightened one gathers vision and returns hearing,\nreverses light to illuminate the source,\nand restores the origin of *One Nature*.\n*\"Carrying\"* means dwelling steadfast without scattering.\n*\"Embracing\"* means preserving unity without loss.\n*One* refers to *Nature*—\nwhat the *Buddhist School* calls *Returning the Flow to Wholeness*,\nwhere the six faculties do not act,\nand clarity does not follow the roots—\nthis is *illuminating the root and emitting light*.\nTo illuminate the root and emit light is to *carry the vital essence and soul*.\nTo return the flow to wholeness is to *embrace unity without separation*.\nThis is the essential path to *restoring Nature and embodying form*—\nnot merely the true cultivation of refining form and spirit for longevity and sharp vision.\n\n*Specialization* means *unmixed*.\n*Extreme* means *ultimate*.\nAn infant, untempted by knowledge or thought to disturb its *qi*,\nthus its *qi* is *specialized*.\nUnburdened by competition between self and other to harm its softness,\nthus its softness is *extreme*.\nThough humans may strive to maintain gentle *qi*,\nthey can manage it temporarily but not perpetually—\nonly as an infant is it truly *extreme*.\nThese two aspects both return to the beginning of life,\nand only through purification and profound contemplation\ndoes the divine attain its ultimate function.\nFor purification removes dust and defilement—\ntruly, the original clarity emerges from this.\nIf even a speck of external filth remains unexhausted,\nthen wisdom is obscured;\nif even a hair’s breadth of imperfection lingers,\nonly purification can resolve it—\nuntil the mind and eyes become luminously clear,\nthen one perceives all things with penetrating vision.\nThe pure remain pure,\nthe impure become pure—\nno selection, no perception of flaws—\nthis is *ultimate*.\n\nHaving perfected self-cultivation thus,\none extends it to govern the world and respond to affairs,\nloving the people and ruling the state—\nthis is the norm.\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate*—\nthis is its transformation.\nAs the *Yijing* says:\n*\"One closing, one opening—this is called transformation.\"*\nTo be *female* is to be harmonious without initiating,\nto follow without leading—\nin its constancy, there is no trace of action.\nIn its response to change, there is no intent to precede things.\nFor there is neither anticipation nor resistance—\none simply abides in natural ease.\n\nTo be bright and far-reaching yet appear without knowledge,\nthis is called *\"wise and insightful, yet guarded by simplicity.\"*\nTo give birth and nourish is *virtue*.\nTo give birth without possessing,\nto act without relying,\nto lead without dominating—\nthis is *virtue* without the mind of *virtue*—\nthis is the *mysterious virtue* of *virtue*.\n\n*Laozi’s* this chapter #2\nencompasses the *Dao* of governing the body and the state.\n\n*Lu Yu* of *Shi Yi* says:\n*\"‘Carrying’ originates from *Heaven*—\nthe beginning of the discourse.\"*\n*Shi Tan* says:\n*\"Carrying the vital essence and soul, embracing unity—\nhow could they separate?\"*\n*Vital essence*, in ancient annotations, is taken as *soul*.\nFor the *soul* is the moon’s luminosity,\nthe *vital essence* is the moon’s shadow.\nThe moon receives sunlight to become luminous,\nthe shadow must carry the luminosity to live without dying.\n*Embracing unity* means the vital essence and soul merge as

of the *Great Transformation* [大易],\nand the *yoke and axle* [辕厢] embody the substance of *non-use*.\nThey are likened to *vehicles, vessels, and chambers*—\ntheir efficacy lies in the interplay of *having* and *non-having*.\n\n**Du Guāngtíng’s Explanation:**\nCherishing *qi* and nurturing the spirit upholds *tranquility*.\nThe utility of *non-use* and the efficacy of *use* lie in their mutual reliance—\ntaking from what exists while leveraging what is absent.\n\nThe three—*vehicles, vessels, and chambers*—\nall borrow their *having* to exploit their *non-having* for function.\n*Vehicles* convey, *vessels* contain, *chambers* shelter—\nthe mind relies on external *having* while harnessing internal *non-having*,\nthus accomplishing the efficacy of *use*.\n\n*Heaven* and *Earth* are the foundation of the *Great Transformation* [大易],\nas stated in the *\"Systematic Transmission\"* [□系辞].\nThe *Great Transformation*’s establishment originates from *Heaven* and *Earth*.\nWithout *Heaven* and *Earth*, the *Dao* would have no foundation.\nThus, *Heaven* and *Earth* are the root and repository of the *Dao*,\nlike rivers and granaries storing its depths.\nHence, it is said: *\"When *Heaven* and *Earth* align, the *Great Transformation* stands within.\"*\n\nIf *Heaven* and *Earth* are destroyed, the *Great Transformation* cannot manifest.\nThis is akin to the *wheel-hub* and *yoke-axle*—\nif the *yoke-axle* is ruined, the *vehicle* cannot exist.\nTo illustrate the principle of *utility*, three analogies are given.\n\nFor governing the realm: if the people perish, the state collapses;\nif the people scatter, the state falters.\nFor cultivating the self: if the spirit departs, life ends;\nif the spirit dissipates, the body perishes.\nThe *Dao* of *utility* truly depends on mutual reliance.\n\n**Zhāng Chōngyìng’s Interpretation:**\n*Non-use* is *emptiness*—\nif *qi* were not empty, it could not circulate and transform into spirit.\nThus, it is called *\"non-use.\"*\n\nThirty spokes converge at one hub—\nits *emptiness* yields the *vehicle*’s function.\n*Clay molded into vessels*—\nits *emptiness* yields the *vessel*’s function.\n*Doors and windows carved for chambers*—\nits *emptiness* yields the *chamber*’s function.\nThus, *having* provides *utility*, while *non-having* enables *use*.\n\n**Riverbank Master’s Explanation:**\nThirty spokes converge at one hub—\nancient *vehicles* had thirty spokes, following the lunar cycle’s count.\nThey converge at the hub because its *emptiness* allows them to unite.\nFor cultivating the self, one must purge emotions and desires,\nleaving the five *zàng*-organs empty—\nthus the spirit returns.\nFor governing the state, few leaders unite many subjects,\nmaking the strong serve the weak.\nWhen *emptiness* prevails, the *vehicle*’s function emerges.\n*Emptiness* means *void*—\nthe hub’s void allows movement;\nthe *zàng*-organs’ void permits bearing burdens.\n\n*Clay molded into vessels*—\n*Bié* (harmonizing) and *zhì* (earth) form drinking and eating utensils.\nTheir *emptiness* yields their function—\nthe vessel’s void allows containment.\n\n*Doors and windows carved for chambers*—\nreferring to constructed dwellings.\nTheir *emptiness* yields their function—\ndoors and windows’ void permits entry and exit;\nthe chamber’s void permits residence.\nThus, *having* provides *utility*—\nbenefiting form and function,\nfearing the vessel’s collapse or the body’s decay.\n*Non-having* enables *use*—\nonly the void can contain all things.\nThus, *\"emptiness governs the formed.\"*\n\nThe *Dao* is *emptiness*.\n**Wáng Fǔsì’s Statement:**\nFrom *thirty spokes* to the *vehicle*’s function—\nthe hub’s *emptiness* unifies the spokes,\nallowing the solid to govern the many.\nFrom *clay molded into vessels* to *non-having* as *use*—\nwood and clay form walls,\nyet all rely on *emptiness* for function.\nThus, *non-having* is the foundation of *having*’s *utility*.\n\n**Emperor Xuānzōng’s Further Explanation:**\nFrom *thirty spokes* to the *vehicle*’s function—\nthis demonstrates how *having* and *non-having*’s efficacy relies on mutual support.\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\nillustrating how the few govern the many.\nThe *yoke-axle*’s *having* forms the *vehicle*,\nwhile the *vehicle*’s *emptiness* enables movement.\nWithout the *yoke-axle*’s *having*, there would be no *vehicle* to utilize.\nIf the *vehicle* were not empty, the *yoke-axle*’s *having* would be useless.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThirty spokes pierce one hub—\nthe few govern the many.\nWhen empty, the *vehicle*’s movement is realized—\n*non-having* benefits *having*.\nWhat is the *Dao*?\nIt is the ultimate *emptiness*, the ultimate *oneness*.\nThus, it moves and nurtures all things,\ncommanding myriad materials,\nmaking ten thousand distinctions coalesce—\nall from a single *image*.\nAll orifices resonate as one sound when struck—\nthe origin of all underheaven’s movement and transformation\nnever departs from ultimate *emptiness* and *oneness*.\n\nEven in *vehicles*:\nthe *yoke-axle* has substance, while the *vehicle*’s interior is empty.\nThe *vehicle*’s emptiness allows movement.\nWithout the *yoke-axle*’s substance, the *vehicle*’s function ceases.\nIf the *vehicle* were not empty, the *yoke-axle*’s parts would be discarded.\n\nThus, when *Heaven* and *Earth* align, the *Great Transformation*’s efficacy is manifest;\nwhen ten thousand transformations flow, the *Dao*’s utility shines.\nHence, through coarse

nose, a mouth, ears, and a window.\nWhen it is agitated, it makes sounds—\n*whoosh*, *hiss*, *shout*, *inhale*, *wail*, *roar*.\nA gentle breeze harmonizes the small orifices,\nwhile a gusting wind harmonizes the great ones.\nThus, though the sounds of all orifices differ vastly in scale,\nwhat stirs them is but one wind.\"*\n\nObserving all under Heaven’s movement and function—\nthe *Yijing*’s *Xìcí* says:\n*\"The sage perceives the movement of all under Heaven,\"*\nmeaning the sage possesses subtlety and mystery\nto see the myriad transformations of all things,\nand knows that all things’ generation and growth\nderive from the pure, singular, subtle *Dao*.\n\nThus, it is said:\n*\"It never departs from ultimate emptiness and singularity.\"*\n\nThis further elucidates:\n*\"When Heaven and Earth align, the *Great Transformation*’s efficacy is manifest,\"*\nand illustrates how the *yoke-axle*’s substance\ncompletes the carriage’s emptiness.\n\nAll transformations flow and function through the *Dao*’s utility.\nWithout the myriad transformations,\nthe *Dao*’s function would not be revealed—\njust as the *yoke-axle* serves the carriage’s purpose,\nand Heaven and Earth contain the *Yijing*’s essence.\n\nThe carriage is a common instrument,\neasily seen by all.\nUsing it as an analogy to illustrate the subtle *Dao*,\nhence it is called a *coarse analogy*.\n\nThe potter shapes clay into vessels—\nwhen empty, they serve their purpose.\nBlending earth to form vessels\nalso reveals how substance relies on emptiness for function.\n\nAll so-called *instruments* and *functions*,\nthough their forms differ by myriad measures—\nlarge, small, square, round—\nsome refined, some crude,\nsome cheap, some precious—\ntheir true function lies in the vessels’ inner emptiness.\n\nThe phrase *\"the potter shapes clay\"* (范土曰陶) is from the *Shàngshū*.\nWhen *Shun* tilled the *Lìshān* fields,\nhe farmed at *Lìshān* and pottered at the *Hé*’s banks—\nthis is the reference.\n*The Liexian Zhuan* says:\n*\"The potter and his disciples, Master Mén,\nwere all ancient potters.\nThey mastered the transformation of the five colors of fire\nand ascended to Heaven.\"*\n\n*Carving doors and windows* (凿户牖) yields the function of a dwelling.\nBefore dwellings existed,\nthe potter shaped the earth and covered it,\ndug the soil and hollowed it out—\nwhen father, son, husband, and wife dwell together, it is called a *family*.\nBefore there were sleeping halls or ancestral temples,\nnor were there *families* or *dwellings*—\n*covering* (复) means covering above the ground,\n*excavating* (凿) the earth below—\nall like the potter’s work.\nThe potter’s craft is today’s tile kilns.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s *Xìcí* says:\n*\"In ancient times, they dwelled in caves and lived in the wilds;\nlater sages replaced this with official halls.\"\nThis is derived from the *Dà Zhuàng* hexagram,\nwhich governs the construction of halls and dwellings\nduring the era of cave-dwelling and wild living—\nhence it is called *Dà Zhuàng*.\nThe *Yijing* speaks of the ancients,\nmeaning before halls and dwellings were built,\nthey only had summer nests and winter

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said, *\"upper antiquity\"*—\nthat is, the time between **Fuxi** and **Huangdi**.\n\n*The Zhuangzi* [\"Thieves and Zhi\"] says that the Master spoke of the ancients,\nwho in summer nested in trees and in winter gathered acorns—\njust as it is written.\nWithin the nests and caves, they took the empty spaces for dwelling.\nNow, the halls and dwellings we construct also take their emptiness for habitation—\nhence it is said: *\"When there is no use for rooms, then there is room for use.\"*\n\n*\"Mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law treading each other’s paths\"*—\n*shè* (蹊) means a path or way,\n*bó* (勃) means anger or resentment.\nAs in *The Zhuangzi* [\"External Things\"], it says:\n*\"When the room is not empty, paths are narrow and confined,\nthen mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law quarrel over the way they walk.\"*\nA daughter-in-law should yield to her mother-in-law in harmony,\nas filial piety and respect demand.\nYet now they quarrel and rage over the path—\nthis is because the room is narrow and confined,\nwith no space for private movement,\nso they clash and fight instead.\nThis is called: *\"When rooms are narrow and not empty,\nmothers-in-law and daughters-in-law quarrel over the path.\"*\n\nWhen the heart is clogged and not empty,\nthen desires and cravings assail it in turn.\n*The Er Ya* says:\n*\"Palaces are called *shì* (室), and rooms are called *gōng* (宫).*\nTheir sizes differ in construction.\"\nNow, rites have been diminished and reduced—\nthe dwelling of the sage is called a *gōng* (palace),\nwhile common dwellings are called *jiāshè* (houses), *wūyǔ* (halls), *tángshì* (chambers and rooms), etc.\nAs the *Lunyu* commentary by **Huang Kan** explains:\n*\"Within the hall, partitions divide it into inner and outer spaces,\nseparating it into rooms.\"*\nThus, Confucius’ disciples were said to have *\"ascended the hall\"* or *\"entered the room.\"*\nSo the *táng* (hall) is the general term,\nwhile *shì* (room) is within it, further distinguished.\n\nThus, *having* is for utility,\nwhile *not having* is for function.\nThe *Dao* is without form—\nit relies on *having* to manifest its efficacy;\nwithout *having*, the *Dao*’s work would not be displayed.\nThings are with form—\nthey rely on the *Dao* to reveal their nature;\nwithout the *Dao*, things would not arise.\n\nThings cannot form and complete themselves without the *Dao*,\nand the *Dao* cannot display its function without things—\njust as with chariots, tools, and rooms:\nall take emptiness to benefit form,\nand rely on form to serve emptiness.\n\nThat which is above form is the origin of the *Dao*,\ndwelling in clarity and emptiness, doing nothing.\nThat which is below form is the function of the *Dao*,\nreceiving substance and taking shape below.\n\nThe *Dao*’s function is displayed through things,\nand things receive form, so they are called *qì* (instruments).\n*Qì* are the category of things with form.\nThe sage follows the *Dao*’s function,\ncrafting them into instruments:\ndrawing trigrams and observing symbols,\nestablishing writing,\nhollowing wood for boats,\ncarving wood for oars,\ncutting wood for pestles,\ndug earth for mortars,\nbending wood for bows,\ncarving wood for arrows,\nconstructing halls and dwellings,\nknotting nets,\nharnessing oxen and riding horses,\ncarrying burdens and traveling far,\ncasting metal for weapons,\nraising poles for flags,\nhewing wood for plows,\ntwisting wood for plowshares—\neach of these, used to benefit the world,\nare all divisions of the *Dao*’s function as instruments.\n\nThis is what the *Yijing* [\"Systematic Commentary\"] refers to:\n*\"The Dao is the name of the formless,\nform is the function of the having.\nAll things arise from the non-being,\nall forms are established by the Dao.\nFirst the Dao, then form—\nthe Dao is above form,\nform is below the Dao.\nThus, that which is above form is called the Dao,\nand that which is below form is called instruments.\nThough form stands at the boundary of Dao and instruments,\nit is above instruments, not the Dao itself.\nSince it has form and substance to serve as instruments,\nit is called ‘that which is below form’—instruments.\nThe Dao is non-being,\nform is being.\nBeing has limits,\nnon-being endures forever.\nThose who cultivate the Dao\nmust externally fortify their form to treasure their being,\ninternally preserve their spirit to venerate their non-being.\nGradually attuning to the subtle non-being,\nthey align with the Dao,\nand thus attain longevity.\"*\n\nThe *Dao* of the utmost unity and non-being,\nthings have symbols and forms as instruments.\nTo clarify the *Dao* through instruments,\nit again borrows metaphors from chariots, tools, and rooms—\nthreefold reversals.\nTheir use in non-being is all of one principle.\n\nWhen the sage governs the world,\nhe sets rewards and punishments,\nestablishes laws and decrees,\nissues teachings and clarifies hierarchy—\nthese are all *having*.\nYet if he governs in silence and stillness,\nemptily and calmly guiding people,\nwithout speaking to transform them,\nall things regulate themselves—\neven with rewards and punishments,\ninstitutions, teachings, and distinctions of rank,\nif they are not used,\nit can still be said to *\"borrow having to employ non-being.\"*\nThis is the utmost principle.\n\nIn cultivating oneself,\none follows the classics to awaken to reason,\nthen through enlightenment forgets words,\npenetrating the subtle gate—\nnot clinging to teachings—\nis this not the same meaning?\n\n**Song Dao Jun** said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at the hub’s function of non-being.\nHaving and non-being are in harmony,\nutility enters and exits—\nthis is called the utmost spirit.\nHaving and non-being differ in appearance,\ntheir substance lies in having,\ntheir function in non-being.\nThe operation of yin and yang,\nthe principle of all things.\nThe chariot’s use is in movement,\nthe instrument’s use is in containment,\nthe room’s use is in emptiness.\nMysterious function arises from utmost non-being,\ntransformation and change are hidden in no burden.\nLike a mirror with no image,\nit reflects things to display light.\nThe sage’s use of the heart\never resolves this truth.\nThus, having is for utility,\nnon-being is for function—\nhaving is solid,\nnon-being is empty.\nSolidity can embody form, appearance, sound, and color,\npossessing substance.\nEmptiness can move, measure, and respond without exhaustion.\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe *Dao* manifests through instruments,\nso non-being does not abandon having;\ninstruments rely on the *Dao*’s subtlety,\nso having must return to non-being.\nWood bends and water moistens,\nfire blazes and metal hardens,\nearth balances and grains flourish—\nthis is *having*, on which people depend for benefit.\nThe heavens move in their course,\nthe earth settles in its place,\nthe four seasons proceed in their order,\nall things flourish—\nwho is their master?\nThis is *non-being*, though the world does not perceive its traces.\nThus, having is never exhausted,\nand having and non-being generate each other.\"*\n\n**Laozi** expounds these three principles clearly.\n**Wang Anshi** said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at the hub’s function of non-being.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The *Dao* has beginnings and endings.\nThe beginning is the source from which all things arise,\nthe ending is the means by which all things are completed.\nThe beginning

things can be completed.\n\nWhen the beginning requires no human effort\nyet all things arise from it,\nthen people may remain silent,\ndoing nothing.\nBut when the ending depends on human effort,\nthen sages must speak,\nmust act.\nThus, the sages of old,\nwho governed above and took all things as their responsibility,\nemployed four methods—ritual, music, punishment, and governance—\nthese are the means by which all things are completed.\nTherefore, sages focus only on refining\nthe methods that complete all things,\nnot speaking of those that give rise to them,\nfor birth comes from natural spontaneity,\nwhich cannot be altered by human effort.\n\nLaozi alone is different.\nHe believes that whatever involves form and function\nis unworthy of mention,\nunworthy of action.\nThus, he largely rejects ritual, music, punishment, and governance,\nand only speaks of the *Dao*.\nThis is a failure to discern the Way’s principles,\nyet he seeks lofty heights—\nan excess of ambition.\nWhat part of the *Dao* does he truly grasp?\nOnly when form and function are involved\nmust one depend on human speech,\non human action.\nHis text says:\n*\"Thirty spokes meet at the

removed.\nBut as for the body—\nhow do I know its use?\nThus, I rely on form for benefit,\nand emptiness for use.\nIf I depend solely on form for use,\nand emptiness for benefit,\nthen what is called benefit\nis also discarded and unused.\nIf I depend on emptiness for use,\nand form for benefit,\nthen what is called use\nis also harmful and not beneficial.\nThus, sages act within yet never possess,\nacting without yet never abandoning.\nThis is how emptiness becomes use,\nand form becomes benefit.\nTherefore, it is said:\n*Refine the essence to enter the divine,*\nto achieve use;\n*benefit and use secure the body,*\nto elevate virtue.\n\nLü Nongshi said:\n*\"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,\nyet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*\nForm and emptiness rely on each other,\nand cannot be considered in isolation.\nThus, without emptiness, one cannot employ form,\nand without form, one cannot perceive emptiness.\nIf one uses form for benefit,\nit may lead to stagnation,\nbut if one uses emptiness for use,\nits application is boundless.\n\nWang Yuanzé said:\n*\"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,\nyet its usefulness lies in the space where there is

usefulness of carriages lies in both form and emptiness,\nthe benefit of dwellings in their vastness,\nwhile vessels, though few and slight in benefit,\nstill cannot be formed without relying on matter.\n\nFor all that serves a benefit—\nwhether much or little,\nwhether great or small—\narises from form alone.\n\nThirty spokes converge at the hub,\nyet its purpose is but the wheel.\nThough its benefits are manifold,\nthe hub’s core and the spokes’ alignment\nare not yet accounted for.\n\nThus, the *Zhou Officials* states:\n*\"A single vessel with two gatherings—\nthe wheel is the most complex.\"*\n\nIn ancient times, dwellings were dug from the earth,\ndoors carved for entry and exit,\nwindows pierced for ventilation.\nThese structures, shaped by *yin* and *yang*,\nestablished the order of rulers and subjects,\nparents and children,\nancestral temples,\ncourtly assemblies,\nand resting places—\nall hidden within completion,\nyet their benefits were vast indeed.\n\nHence, the *I Ching* says:\n*\"Later sages refined the world with roofs and walls,*\ntaking inspiration from *Great Strength* (*Tai Zhuang*).\"\nVessels like pots and jars belong to this category.\n\nYet even among these,\nfew are prized,\nmany are merely functional,\nthe round follows the compass,\nthe square the ruler,\nthe curved the hook,\nthe straight the plumb line—\nnone without benefit from form,\nthough their true use lies in the realm of emptiness.\n\nThe Master Lao expounds upon this,\nto reveal that though emptiness depends on form to manifest its use,\none cannot discard emptiness for the sake of benefit alone.\n\nThus, when form decays,\nemptiness remains.\nThe principle of benefit and use:\nunited, they are one;\nseparated, they are two.\n\nBenefit and use are not the same—\nbenefit is the realm of *yin*,\nwhile use is rooted in emptiness.\nThe wheel’s benefit lies in its form,\nthe vessel’s in its blending and shaping,\nthe dwelling’s in its doors and windows—\nyet their true use resides in emptiness.\n\nThis is why the sage *Mencius* said:\n*\"The ancient ways took benefit as their foundation,\nand the Great Yu’s drainage of waters\nwas but the removal of what was not needed.*\nHere, the use of emptiness is revealed.\n\nThe prior chapter spoke of *Mysterious Virtue* (*Xuande*),\nyet *Mysterious Virtue* is relative to emptiness—\nthus, it follows with the wheel’s thirty spokes converging at the hub.\n\nLiu Ji said:\n*\"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,\nyet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.\"*\n\nExalted Master Bian Que taught:\n*\"Within the human body are five *zang* organs,\nwhere the True Qi converges.*\nEach of the five *zang* is governed by six *qi*,\nthus the origin of the thirty-six convergence lies in them—\njust as the wheel’s thirty spokes.\nFlowing without ceasing,\nthey unite at the single hub,\nlike the thirty spokes converging at the hub.\n\nThe sage understands the pivot of transformation,\nusing form as its physical manifestation,\nthe body as a furnace,\nthe Three Palaces as tripods,\nand refining within the void—\nas boundless as the carriage one rides,\nthe vessels one employs,\nand the dwelling one inhabits.\nForm serves as the vessel,\nemptiness as the use.\nThus, form is for benefit,\nemptiness for use.\n\nThe ignorant of this age\nhear only of the Dao of abandoning the body,\nyet fail to grasp the subtlety of entering it.\nThis is why the Master Lao\nuses the wheel, vessels, and dwellings\nas detailed analogies.\n\nIt is like the *Qian* and *Kun* forming ranks,\nyet the *I Ching* stands within them—\nwhen *Qian* and *Kun* perish,\nthe *I Ching* cannot be seen;\nwhen form decays,\nthe spirit cannot be preserved—\nthis is why form and spirit must both be refined.\n\nThe sage uses form as its vessel,\nemptiness as its spirit,\nentering form to reach emptiness,\nand employing the false to attain the true.\n\nHow could mere appearance, name, or sound\nbe sufficient to grasp its essence?\nThus, it follows with the five colors.\n\nZhao Shizhen said:\n*\"First, it illustrates the principle that emptiness is the root of use:\nOne, to elucidate the *Qian* and *Kun* cycle of return.\nThirty spokes converge at the hub—\nwhen emptiness is present,\nthe wheel’s use emerges.\nThe Dao, though void, manifests as use;\nits function unseen,\nit relies on substance to reveal itself.\nThings, though solid, depend on voidness for their benefit;\ntheir emptiness unseen,\nthey borrow the void for their capacity.\nOne vessel, one use—\nmutually clarifying,\none and emptiness alone can truly manifest.\nThe use of emptiness is clear in principle,\nthe function of the void is unfathomable in Dao.\nThus, one knows that substance alone cannot serve as use,\nwhile voidness harmonizes with all things.\nUsing three objects to display the mechanism,\ntesting two aspects to glimpse the one—\nthe alchemical method follows the lunar cycle,\nadvancing and receding in thirty days,\nthen naturally waxing and waning.\n\nOne is the hub—\nthough it has form, it is not used.\nThirty are the spokes—\nthe count of the moon’s phases,\nall revolving around this principle.\n\nTo employ emptiness in guiding form—\nwithout the hub,\nthe spokes have no place to rest,\njust as the Dao governs time—\nwithout the days,\nthe moon would not arise.\nThe *yin* void depends on substance to borrow,\nits eclipses and waxings shaped by the interplay of light and dark.\nThe *yang* substance contains the void,\nnurturing the *yin* like a toad,\nand gestating the *moon* within the *yin* like a hare in shadow.\n\nThis is how the alchemist\ntakes the *Qian* and *Kun* cycle of return,\nand clarifies the benefits of form and emptiness.\n\nThe Dao originally has no image,\nyet alchemy arises naturally.\nThe hub and spokes illustrate the thirty-six principles,\nand the text expounds on form and emptiness\nas the foundation of benefit and use—\nthus, the adept of the Way\nresponds to all things through emptiness,\nwhile substance obstructs and does not flow.\n\nHence, emptiness is for benefit,\nform is for use.\n\nThe spokes and the hub\ncomprise the wheel’s complete structure.\nThe spokes’ use lies in the hub—\nvoidness guides all things,\nas if the hub were solid and the spokes hollow—\nwhere would they rest?\n\nAgain, it is said:\n*\"The wheel is beneath the house.\"*\nWhen emptiness is present,\nit refers to the void within the hub.\nWith solid spokes and an empty hub,\nthe wheel’s use emerges.\nWhen it moves without end,\nthen the wheel’s benefit is truly stored.\n\nThus, form is for benefit,\nemptiness for use.\n\nTwo, it points to blending and shaping.\nBlending and shaping create vessels—\nwhen emptiness is present,\nthe vessel’s use emerges.\nBlending and shaping mean\nmixing clay and kneading earth to form vessels—\ntoday’s pots and jars are examples.\nTheir emptiness is used—\nwhen they can be filled,\nthat is the vessel’s benefit.\n\nHeaven and Earth arise from the void,\nyet generate all things.\nThe Great Dao, though void,\nencompasses Heaven, Earth, and humanity,\nand with a void heart\nresponds to all existence.\nBlending and shaping use emptiness within\nto receive all things—\nthus, one knows that blending and shaping\nare the benefit of form,\nwhile emptiness within\nis the use of emptiness.»",

      "translated_text": "---\n\nHaving first clarified the meaning of the wheel’s hub and spokes,\nnow further elucidating the principle of blending and shaping,\nfor indeed the interplay of form and emptiness exhausts the Dao’s full function—\nits meaning profound and subtle, not easily comprehended.\nThis is the very nature of reality aligned with the Way of Heaven.\n\nThus, it further illustrates the principle of doors and windows.\n\n**Three: The Principle of Doors and Windows.**\nCarve doors and windows to make a hall—\nits emptiness is the void #1,\nyet it yields the use of a chamber.\nBarriers block the light,\nbut emptiness allows all things to be contained.\nIn all cases, one takes emptiness within for use.\n\nHalf a door becomes a door,\ncrossed wood becomes a window.\nDoors function by opening and closing,\nwindows serve by revealing light.\nIf doors and windows were not carved,\nhow would halls and chambers exist?\nRemoving obstructions creates emptiness,\nand chambers take this emptiness for dwelling—\nthus, doors and windows are for benefit,\nwhile chambers are for use.\nFor doors and windows provide the use of chambers,\nand only then can chambers be complete.\n\nYet it does not end with these three—\ntaking emptiness for use applies to all things.\nGrain stores are empty yet receive,\nflutes and keys are empty yet sound,\nvessels are empty yet hold,\nboats are hollow yet carry.\n\nThe Most High points to these three,\nand the rest may be inferred.\nLater, it clarifies the uses of form and emptiness.\nThus, form is for benefit,\nemptiness is for use.\nUsing vessels to manifest the Dao,\nthe Dao is then clearly seen within vessels.\nUsing emptiness as function,\nfunction is then not found in solidity.\n\nYet vessels cannot be destroyed—\nif vessels are destroyed, their use cannot be made clear.\nBorrowing things to make statements,\nwithout things, words have no foundation—\nthus, the wheel’s emptiness fulfills its function of transport,\ntaking the creative vigor of *Qian* to generate all things as its model.\nBlending and shaping have emptiness within for use,\ntaking the receptive emptiness of *Kun* to contain all things as its model.\nDoors and windows have chambers for use,\ncomparing the emptiness of the heart to supply all affairs as its model.\nThus, one knows emptiness itself has efficacy,\nthe Dao is revealed through vessels—\nwho would say the void is useless?\nThey do not know that daily use lies in emptiness.\n\nTo say only form and appearance are true,\nyet not know that form and appearance obscure their use.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The void is not destroyed, all things are real.\"*\nBenefit and use are both illuminated.\n\n*The System of Changes* says:\n*\"If *Qian* and *Kun* are destroyed, there will be no way to see the *Yi*.\"*\nWhen emptiness and reality illuminate each other,\nonly then does one know the pivot begins,\nobtaining the central harmony\nto respond to the boundless.\n\nShao Ruoyu said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at one hub—\nemptiness is their use.\"*\n\nLaozi, using the wheel, chambers, and vessels,\nillustrates the principles of things—\nform and emptiness, benefit and use.\nBorrowing form for benefit,\nwithin emptiness, the wondrous and inexhaustible use is revealed.\n\nTake the wheel, for instance—\ntoday’s eighteen spokes, ancient thirty,\nall converging at one hub to form a wheel.\nBorrowing the wheel for its tangible benefit,\nwithin its emptiness lies the wondrous function—\nin its rotation, one knows emptiness is the wheel’s use.\n\nBlending and shaping kneads clay to make vessels,\nborrowing vessels for their tangible benefit,\nwithin their emptiness lies the wondrous use—\nin their capacity to hold and store.\nThus, one knows emptiness is the vessel’s use.\n\nAncient dwellings were dug from earth,\ndoors were carved for entry and exit,\nwindows for viewing the outside—\nonly then were the institutions of rulers, ministers, parents, children,\nancestral temples, and feasts established as chambers.\nBorrowing chambers for their tangible benefit,\nwithin their emptiness lies the wondrous function—\nin their capacity for dwelling.\nThus, one knows emptiness is the chamber’s use.\n\nTherefore, form is taken for benefit,\nemptiness for wondrous use—\nthus, borrowing the phantom body for benefit,\nthe heart of no-mind for use.\nThis teaches the student to embody the logic of form and emptiness,\nto grasp the Dao’s benefit and use.\n\nWang Zhiran said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at one hub—\nemptiness is their use.\"*\n\nMankind, born into the cosmos,\nfaces urgent daily needs—\nthree things the body cannot do without:\nvehicles, tools, and dwellings.\nForm is for benefit,\nemptiness is for use.\nIf benefit and use are not properly aligned,\nthey become grave afflictions for the living.\n\nThose who do not understand must first consider what suits them,\nthen determine the right course.\n\nAs for vehicles, from the Son of Heaven to commoners,\neach has their due.\nThe Son of Heaven’s chariots are called \"ten thousand,\"*\nlords \"thousand,\"*\nministers \"hundred,\"*\nwhile commoners ride single-horse carts at most.\nFew is not lacking,\nbut excess is sure to transgress propriety—\nadding ornate decorations, embroidered reins,\nyet not calling it deceitful or disrupting norms—what else could it be?\nThus, the ancients valued simplicity,\nand even riding or walking followed ritual.\nHence, the Master walked when the Master walked,\nran when the Master ran—\nthe gentleman’s daily conduct never strayed from essentials.\n\nSome fed horses and oiled chariots,\nyet still seemed excessive in their extravagance,\ndeviating from the Sage’s pure and unadorned way of governing past and present.\nTo the point of hunting excursions,\nbreaking axles, wheels left unfinished—\nhow could such recklessness be fitting?\n\nAs for blending and shaping,\nit refers to molding clay and crafting pottery.\nThe ancients used what was sufficient,\ndiscarded what was spent—\nno hoarding, no waste.\nThe people found joy in food and drink alone.\nHow could they know the quality of their tools?\n\nIn recent times, however,\nstrange novelties are prized,\nwealth and ease sought above all—\nnone can match the age’s indulgence.\nYet even the sun’s warmth is not valued for its rarity,\nonly for its comfort to body and mouth—\npeople fail to heed the gradual loss.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Carve doors and windows to make a chamber.\"*\nThis refers to ancient

      "translated_text": "「This meaning is indeed a metaphor for Daoist learning—\nthe more one cultivates the Way, the greater the loss of rigid attachments,\nand its principle rests solely in the interplay of form and emptiness.\n\nThose who doubt Laozi’s teachings in the world\ndo so because they believe his \"non-being\" lacks substance,\nand thus cannot govern—\nthey fail to grasp that Laozi’s \"non-being\"\naims to transcend \"being\" in order to utilize it,\nnot to negate all form and function utterly from beginning to end.\n\nThe essence lies in the balance of intent and totality.\n\nThe words of King Linchuan [Wang Bi] state:\n*\"The chariot-maker knows to govern its spokes and nave,\nyet never seeks to grasp ‘non-being’—\nyet ‘non-being’ arises as its very function once spokes and nave are complete.\"*\n\nIf one were to discard the spokes and nave from the chariot,\nor abandon rites, music, punishments, and governance in the world,\nand seek \"non-being\" as their sole function,\nthen such reasoning is close to folly.\nThis is a misinterpretation of Laozi’s intent.\n\nLaozi’s teachings seek to fulfill the utility of rites and laws,\nwhile transcending them to achieve true function.\nHis words on \"being\" and \"non-being\"\nare akin to \"gain\" and \"loss.\"\n\nTo \"gain\" is to seek what one does not yet possess;\nto \"loss\" is to transform what one already has.\nThis is his application of chariot principles to human affairs.\n\nWhen one seeks \"being,\" it means accumulating trust and goodness\nto fill oneself,\nand to make them substantial and grand.\nWhen one seeks \"non-being,\" it means taking what is already full and transforming it,\nso that its traces vanish yet its function remains.\nThe phrases \"being\" and \"non-being\"\nrefer to the realm where human effort is applied.\n\nYet King Linchuan’s theory equates \"being\" and \"non-being\"\nto their completion,\nas if Laozi did not know that a chariot without wheels\ncannot be drawn or pushed.\nIndeed, Laozi’s words are subtle and difficult to fathom—\nthough King Linchuan most cherished his text,\nhe still erred in following the words while losing their meaning.\nThe calamity of the Western Jin [dynasty] stemmed precisely from this.\n\nThey took Laozi’s metaphorical language to belittle rites and laws,\nattaching themselves to the realm of discarding benevolence and righteousness.\nHearing of Laozi’s reverence for *wuwei* [non-action],\nthey hoped to govern without spokes and nave,\nas if a chariot could move itself.\nThey failed to understand that within metaphorical language lies true principle,\nand that *wuwei* [non-action] itself contains *wu buwei* [no non-action].\n\nHe merely sought to employ the spokes and nave\nto manifest the function of \"non-being,\"\nyet never abandoned them to neglect their \"being.\"\nLaozi’s teachings began to take effect in governance\nfrom the Han dynasty onward.\nWhen Cao Can [曹参] served Emperor Xuan [孝思],\nand Emperor Wen [文帝] succeeded Emperor Gao [高帝],\nthey achieved harmony through *qingjing* [tranquility and simplicity],\nand purity through *yuandu* [primordial stillness],\nthough they did not fully transform \"being\" into \"non-being,\"\nthey could still be said to have transcended form and substance\nto gather emptiness.\n\nYet their *qingjing* and *yuandu*\nwere not equivalent to abandoning all governance.\nThe foundational laws of Emperor Gao were still in place,\nand Xiao He’s [萧何] institutions remained.\nThus, the spokes and nave were already prepared in advance.\nHence, Cao Can and Emperor Wen could rely on their utility,\nachieving stillness when they wished and silence when they desired.\n\nIf one were to discard Emperor Gao’s laws\nand Xiao He’s regulations entirely,\nleaving all to indifference,\nthen the Western Jin would have already perished.\n\nHuang Maocai [黄茂材] said:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at the hub to serve the function of ‘non-being.’\nThere is ‘being’ within ‘being,’ and ‘being’ within ‘non-being.’\n‘Being’ within ‘non-being’ has boundless function;\n‘being’ within ‘being’ offers great benefit.\nThe spokes and nave form the chariot,\nclay and mud shape the vessel,\ndoors and windows create the dwelling—\nthese are ‘being’ within ‘being,’\nupon which people depend for extensive utility.\nThough there may be no chariot, its function remains;\nthough there may be no vessel, its function remains;\nthough there may be no dwelling, its function remains—\nthis is ‘being’ within ‘non-being.’\nThe enlightened and accomplished rely on its boundless function.\nToday, texts like *The Parameters of the Same* [*参同契*] and *The Yellow Court Scripture* [*黄庭经*]\nabound with such sayings,\nfor they have their origins.\n\nZhan Qiupu [詹秋圃] said:\n*\"In ancient times, ten spokes converged at a single hub\nto serve the function of ‘non-being.’\nThe chapter ‘On Non-Action’ [无用] within *On Non-Action* [无用]\nstill contains practical application.\nThough a chariot with thirty spokes revolves harmoniously around one hub,\neven at the dawn of creation when there was no chariot,\nits function of bearing loads was already inherent—\nit cannot be discarded.\nThough clay and mud are molded into vessels,\neven at the beginning when there were no vessels,\ntheir function as containers was already present—\nit cannot be omitted.\nAgain, when doors, windows, and openings are carved to form dwellings,\neven at the time when there were no dwellings,\ntheir function as shelter was already there—\nhow much more so must one have refuge and rest!\nThese three [chariot, vessel, dwelling]\nderive their utility from earth and wood,\nyet their practical functions are ever-present.\nFrom ‘non-being’ to ‘being,’\n‘non-being’ is merely a means to harness utility for greater utility—\nthis is the function of ‘non-being.’\n\nZhang Chongying [张冲应] replied:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at the hub to serve the function of ‘non-being.’\nThe heavens possess the Six Qi [六气], the earth the Five Phases [五行].\nThe Six Qi are yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness.\nThe Five Phases are water, wood, fire, earth, and metal.\nWhen heaven and earth first divided,\nwater came first,\nand when humans first took form,\nwater was their foundation.\nWater governs the kidneys, the root of life.\nIn the earth, the number six generates wood,\nwood governs the liver, the abode of the soul.\nIn the earth, the number eight generates fire,\nfire governs the heart, the chamber of the spirit.\nIn the earth, the number two generates soil,\nsoil governs the spleen, the seat of intent.\nIn the earth, the number ten generates metal,\nmetal governs the lungs, the repository of the vital breath.\nIn the earth, the number four regenerates water.\nThe Five Phases in the earth, in their cyclic generation,\ncomprise thirty in total.\nThis is the *qi* [vital force] of the body,\nwhich moves and operates in accordance with it—\nwithout contradiction.\nThus it is said: ‘Thirty spokes converge at one hub,’\nmeaning that humans are confined within the earth’s framework,\nand the Five Phases, following the earth’s thirtyfold cycle,\noperate to ensure the Six Qi flow harmoniously—\njust as thirty spokes enable the hub’s rotation.\nOthers might say that the Five Phases generate in cycles,\nand the Six Qi harmonize in balance,\nand that five and six combine to form thirty.\nThe *qi* [vital force] moves itself—\nall are one explanation.\nYet the hub’s value lies in its rotation,\nand it cannot rotate if its core is hollowed out.\n»*",

*\"Obtain its central pivot to respond to the boundless.\"*\nAll are skilled in establishing metaphors.\nSome interpret the thirty spokes as corresponding to the number of days in a month,\na later passage finding it forced and awkward.\n\nOthers take **無有** (*wúyǒu*) as *\"not yet having\"* and cite the *Yì* [□] *Xìyǔ* [系辞] on the advantage of boats and oars,\ntaken from the *Hàn* [涣] hexagram,\nand *\"riding oxen, mounting horses,\"*\ntaken from the *Suí* [随] hexagram,\nas proof—\nsaying that even before these implements existed,\ntheir functional principle was already present.\nThis is another view.\n\nNiu Miao’s *Transmission* states: *\"The thirty spokes yield the use of a chariot.\"*\nA single chariot has thirty spokes,\nand a month has thirty days.\nWhen it speaks of the chariot hub,\nit refers to the sun and moon.\nIf spoken of in terms of **道** (*Dào*),\nthen before the Great Primordium (*Dàpuǎo*) had yet divided,\nbefore heaven and earth had roots,\nbefore the sun and moon shone,\nthere was originally no use of sun and moon.\n\nIn terms of implements and utility,\nthe Age of Great Simplicity (*Shànggǔ Chúnpǔ*)\nwas pure and unknowing,\nwith no use of chariot hubs for turning or transporting.\nIt was only from the Yellow Emperor onward,\nobserving the revolving of the wild grass (*péng*),\nthat he fashioned the chariot\nto bear heavy loads and reach distant places.\nLater generations, indulgent in luxury,\nadorned it with gold and jade,\nand painted its hubs with vermilion and cinnabar.\nThe Most High Sage (*Tàishàng*)\nwitnessed the customs growing extravagant,\nthe purity of antiquity fading,\nand thus composed this sigh:\n*\"When there was yet no chariot,\nits use was already present.\"*\n\nMolding clay to make vessels,\nwhen there was yet no vessel,\nits use was already present.\n*\"Molding\"* means blending,\n*\"clay\"* refers to earth—\nit speaks of blending earth to make vessels.\nVessels (*qìng*) are the tripod vessels.\nAncient people took heaven and earth as the divine tripod vessel,\nand the sun and moon as its windows and doors.\n\nIf spoken of in terms of **道** (*Dào*),\nthen before the Great Polarity (*Tàijí*) had yet been distinguished,\nthere was originally no heaven and earth, no sun and moon—\nthat was **道** (*Dào*).\n\nIn terms of dwellings,\nthe Age of Great Simplicity had no palaces,\nsummer dwellings were boats and nests,\nwinter dwellings were caves and burrows.\nLater sages transformed them into palaces,\nwith lofty beams and eaves to shelter against wind and rain.\nFrom the Middle Ages onward,\ncustoms grew refined yet decadent,\nluxury and extravagance flourished,\npalaces sprawled in intricate layers,\ntowers soared in dizzying heights,\nemotions ran wild, desires unbounded,\npushing excess to its utmost.\nThe Most High Sage lamented the decline of the age,\nand thus sighed:\n*\"When there was yet no dwelling,\nits use was already present.\"*\n\nThus, **有** (*yǒu*) is relied upon for utility,\nwhile **無** (*wú*) is relied upon for function.\n**有** (*yǒu*) refers to the sun and moon\nturning and moving to bring forth cold and heat,\nto heaven and earth as the divine tripod vessel\nto refine and transform all things,\nto the divine dwelling under heaven\nto shelter and nourish all beings,\nto the chariot hub bearing and transporting\nto facilitate its turning,\nto vessels and utensils\nto aid in drinking and eating,\nto dwellings and windows\nto replace nests and caves.\n\nAll these are the sages’ preparation of things and realization of utility\nto benefit the world.\nThus it is said: *\"**有** (*yǒu*) is relied upon for utility.\"*\n\n**無** (*wú*) is relied upon for function,\nmeaning when heaven and earth and all things were yet **無** (*wú*),\nonly **道** (*Dào*) was empty and boundless.\nIt is because of this emptiness and boundlessness that function is realized,\nand thus it is said: *\"**無** (*wú*) is relied upon for function.\"*\n\nThe **休休庵** (*Xiūxiū’ān*) commentary states:\n*\"From the thirty spokes to **無** (*wú*) relied upon for function.\"*\nAwakening to the Great Dao is called *\"obtaining the body.\"*\nOne must also obtain function.\nObtaining the body but not function is called *\"dead matter.\"*\nObtaining function but not the body is called *\"playing with affairs.\"*\nRecognizing **德** (*virtue/power*) and **道** (*Dào*),\nbody and function complete,\nis called a *\"sage of insight.\"*\n\nThe **Old Master** (*Lǎozi*) uniquely uses the metaphors of chariot-making and window-carving\nto illustrate **無** (*wú*)’s wondrous function,\nbenefiting and saving the world.\nThus all deeds of those who follow the **道** (*Dào*) are beneficial.\n\nIn the world, what is **無** (*wú*) is obtained for use,\nabandoning **道** (*Dào*) and **德** (*virtue/power*),\nhow then could one complete the human world?\n\nYang Zhìrén says:\n*\"From the thirty spokes to **無** (*wú*) relied upon for function.\"*\nIt refers to the chariot wheel.\nThe thirty spokes follow the pattern of a month’s days.\nThe wheel is the mechanism,\nthe turning is its function.\nHeaven uses the Big Dipper as its mechanism,\nhumans use the mind as theirs,\ngathering the original spirit as spokes around the central palace,\nletting the true **氣** (*qi*) flow and move through the body,\nrevolving and transforming creation,\nconcentrating the Five Phases,\nharmonizing the Four Symbols—\nall are the uses of the chariot.\n\n*\"Molding clay\"* refers to the potter’s wheel,\na metaphor for the same mechanism.\nWithout this wheel, how could vessels be made?\nIf humans vary their mechanisms at the central pass,\nthe **栲子** (*kēngzi*) will turn everywhere without obstruction.\n\n*\"Windows and doors\"* are apertures.\nIt is like the birth of **混沌** (*Hùndùn*),\na formless mass.\nIf one were to carve an aperture daily,\nby the seventh day **混沌** (*Hùndùn*) would die.\nHumans have seven apertures;\nretracting vision inward brings life,\nletting it loose outward brings death.\n\nThus the doctrine of **有** (*yǒu*) and **無** (*wú*) is spoken of by humans.\nIf one applies **無** (*wú*) to all things,\n**無** (*wú*) generates **有** (*yǒu*),\nand obtains its function.\n\n**無** (*wú*) within **有** (*yǒu*) harmonizes wonderfully with the Primordial.\nYet when it speaks of **有** (*yǒu*),\nit means **無** (*wú*)’s defects.",
      "overlap_context": " eyes, hands, and feet remain intact,\nyet the *wú* no longer moves them—\nno different from a wooden puppet—\nbecause the divine luminosity has departed,\nwhile the earthly frame remains.\n\nHowever, *you* and *wú* mutually rely on each other,\nand neither can be neglected.\nIf one were to take a mortal body\nto cultivate the **sage’s fruit**,\nby obstructing it to achieve utter void,\nwhat harm would there be?\n\nIn general, *you* is finite,\n*wú* is infinite—\nthis is why they differ in virtue and function.",

      "translated_text": "To possess a single eye within the realm of **有** (*yǒu*) and **無** (*wú*)—\nonly then is one truly at the core of the matter.\n\n**無** (*wú*) is the means by which all things function.\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Does Heaven move itself?\nDoes Earth settle itself?\nDo the sun and moon vie for their places?\nWho directs this?\nWho holds the reins?\nWho remains in stillness?\nWhen pushed into motion—\nis it because of some inherent mechanism?\nOr because it is bound by necessity?\nOr because it moves and cannot stop itself?\"*\n\nQingzhong further explained:\n*\"The thirty spokes converge at the void for their function.\nAll things under Heaven do not arise from **有** (*yǒu*) alone,\nbut from **無** (*wú*).\nWhen at **無** (*wú*), read it as a single phrase.\nAt the time of the thirty spokes,\nthere is yet no utility of the chariot.\nYet the chariot’s function already resides within.\nThus it is said: ‘the function of the chariot.’\nWhen shaping clay into vessels,\nthere is yet no utility of the utensil.\nYet the utensil’s function already resides within.\nThus it is said: ‘the function of the utensil.’\nWhen carving doors and windows,\nthere is yet no utility of the dwelling.\nYet the dwelling’s function already resides within.\nThus it is said: ‘the function of the dwelling.’*\n\nAccording to the *Zhou Li* [*考工记*]:\n*\"The chariot’s canopy is round to emulate Heaven,\nthe carriage’s base is square to emulate Earth,\nand the thirty spokes symbolize the phases of the moon.\nThe **毂** (*gǔ*) is the central axle of the chariot,\nwhere the spokes converge to form the wheel.\n**埏** (*kēng*) means to blend,\n**埴** (*zhí*) is clay.\nThe potter turns and shapes to create vessels.\n**凿** (*záo*) means to pierce.\nHalf a door is called a **户** (*hù*),\nwindows beside the door are called **牖** (*yǒu*).\nAnother interpretation: **無** (*wú*) is emptiness, is void.\nWhen the **毂** (*gǔ*) is hollow and empty,\nthe wheel can turn;\nwhen the chariot is hollow and empty,\nit can carry people.\nThus, where there is emptiness and void,\nthere is the function of movement and bearing.\nWhen shaping vessels, the exterior is solid while the interior is hollow.\nWhere the vessel’s emptiness resides,\nthere is the function of containing things.\nIn ancient times, people lived in caves,\ndug out earth to cover their dwellings,\nand thus created the design of doors and windows.\nWhere the dwelling’s emptiness resides,\nthere is the function of habitation and passage.\nThus, **有** (*yǒu*) is used for utility,\nand **無** (*wú*) is used for function.\nThe utility of vessels lies in their form,\nwhile the function of **無** (*wú*) lies in the void.\nFor vessels to be useful,\ntheir utility must manifest outwardly,\nrelying on emptiness for function.\nFor emptiness to serve its purpose,\nit must be hollow within,\nborrowing the vessel’s utility to fulfill it.\nThus, **無** (*wú*) depends on **有** (*yǒu*) for utility,\nwhile **有** (*yǒu*) relies on **無** (*wú*) for function.\n**無** (*wú*) speaks of the Dao beyond form,\nwhile **有** (*yǒu*) speaks of shaped vessels.\nThe Dao is not revealed without vessels,\nand vessels are incomplete without the Dao.\nThe interdependence of Dao and vessels\ncannot be separated—one cannot be discarded for the other.\n\nAnother interpretation:\nBian Que said that within the human body are the five viscera,\nwhere true *qi* converges.\nEach viscera governs six *qi*,\nthus forming the thirtyfold convergence—\nlike the thirty spokes of a chariot.\nFlowing ceaselessly, they communicate through a single pivot,\njust as the thirty spokes unite at the **毂** (*gǔ*).\nThe sage understands the pivot of transformation,\nusing **有** (*yǒu*) as form and substance,\nthe body as the furnace,\nthe Three Palaces as the tripod,\ncrafting creation within the void of indistinctness.\nLike the chariot one rides,\nthe vessels one uses,\nthe dwelling one inhabits—\nthese exist as **有** (*yǒu*) in form,\nyet as **無** (*wú*) in function.\nThus, **有** (*yǒu*) is for utility,\nand **無** (*wú*) is for function.\nAs Wei Boyang’s *Parametric Concordance* states:\n*\"Use **無** (*wú*) to govern **有** (*yǒu*);*\n*the function of vessels lies in emptiness.\"*\nAll these interpretations hold merit;\nlet them remain for those who seek enlightenment.\n\nXu Liuyu said:\n*\"The thirty spokes converge at the **毂** (*gǔ*) for their function.\nThis passage speaks of the sage’s insight:\nthe thirty spokes unite at the **毂** (*gǔ*).\nObserving things to understand the body’s Dao—\nthis is not merely about words.\nThe principles of chariots, dwellings, and vessels\nhave been thoroughly discussed by the ancients.\nThis need not be repeated.\nYet the Dao of observing things to know the body\nis seldom spoken of.\nConsider this: the head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth,\nbody, hands, and feet—\nall compose the self,\neach with its own governance.\nThough they form a single mass,\nmovement, speech, and laughter all originate from within.\nYet when seeking the ‘self’ (*wú*),\nthere is no precise location to point to.\nIs it not the self without position,\nenabling the body’s numbered functions?\nThis is what the text means by:\n**‘有** (*yǒu*) **is for utility, 無** (*wú*) **is for function.’**\nReaders should ponder this deeply.\n\nChai Yuangao said:\n*\"The thirty spokes converge at the **毂** (*gǔ*).\nThe spokes are the wheel’s boards,\nthe **毂** (*gǔ*) is what pierces through them.\nThe **毂** (*gǔ*) is the body,\nthe spokes are the function.\nLike the heart governing all laws.\nWhen at **無** (*wú*), there is the chariot’s function.\nWhen there is no chariot,\nwho reveals the marvel of spokes and **毂** (*gǔ*)?\nWhen shaping clay into vessels,\nwho reveals the marvel of dug-out dwellings?\nThus, **有** (*yǒu*) is for utility,\nand **無** (*wú*) is for function.\nWhen **有** (*yǒu*) manifests, its benefits are clear;\nwhen **無** (*wú*) manifests, its marvels are revealed.\nThe heart as body, utility as function.\"\n\nSu Jingjing said:\n*\"From ‘the thirty spokes converge at the **毂** (*gǔ*)’ to ‘for their function,’\nthis passage embodies Laozi’s intent—\n**無** (*wú*) alone.\nThe **毂** (*gǔ*) is the chariot’s central axle,\nthe spokes are the wheel’s ribs.\nOnly because the **毂** (*gǔ*) is
