  "full_translation": "**Transmission Rituals and Precepts with Annotations and Secrets**\n**Text Title:** *Transmission Rituals and Precepts with Annotations and Secrets*\n**Full Title:** *The Supreme Mystery Section, Eighth Scroll: Lord Lao’s Transmission Rituals and Precepts with Annotations and Secrets*\n**Author:** Unknown, approximately from the Northern and Southern Dynasties period\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Orthodox Section, Part One\n\n---\n\n**Transmission Rituals and Precepts with Annotations and Secrets**\n\nThe Master says: Lord Lao is the great sage who attained the Dao, the teacher revered in both the hidden and manifest realms. When responding to conditions, he transforms and adapts to all directions; when his work is accomplished, he conceals himself and abides in constancy. Abiding without fixed abode, he is ever-present without absence. His presence in absence resides within the boundless; the extremity of the boundless culminates in the Supreme Mystery.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery is the capital where the great ancestral ultimate abides, the lord to which lesser lineages, not yet perfected, are guided and return. This capital is without limit, all-encompassing and complete, vast beyond comparison—hence it is called \"Supreme.\" Though existent, it is difficult to perceive—hence it is called \"Mystery.\" Though the ordinary eye cannot behold it, the eye of wisdom may discern it. Through studying scriptures, practicing good deeds, and maintaining mindfulness of the ancestral lord without momentary lapse, one attains this wisdom.\n\nThe lord is originally nameless, yet is designated as the \"Most High.\" When responding to conditions, he is thus named, and one gains the eye of wisdom. The fruit of wisdom arises from good causes; causes arise from an enlightened master. The master’s Dao is non-dual, and the scriptures are likewise unified, unified in the Dao and its virtue. The extremity of the Dao and virtue is the lord who completes the threefold union. The honored one who achieves unity resides in the capital of the Supreme Mystery, transforming and responding across the ten directions, unfolding the subtleties of being and non-being.\n\nThe subtlety culminates in the Venerable One, who is the ancestral master. The master’s essence is all-pervading, yet his attainment of the Dao is uniquely exalted—thus he is called the \"Supreme Mystery, Most High Lord Lao.\" Through accumulated study and cyclic cultivation, he ascends to the rank of sage and perfected one. His responses to the boundless are beyond description.\n\nIn recent kalpas, he manifested in the world, born during the Shang dynasty. Descending to blend with the world’s radiance, he was born among the common people, demonstrating the clarity of gestation and birth. Though dwelling in the lower realms, he attained the Dao without hindrance. His mother, wandering amidst the plum trees, heard the pure wind at the edge of the pine’s dust. His jade-like form shone brilliantly, his essence upright and unblemished, whole and without division, two bodies in perfect harmony. Thus, he took Li as his surname and Er (Ear) as his name, residing in Quren Village, Lai County, Ku Prefecture, in the state of Chu.\n\nHe traversed the six voids and taught across the three realms. Whether appearing in the world or departing from it, whether in action or non-action, he exhaustively investigated all. During the time of King Wen, he served as the Keeper of the Archives. Whether in retreat or in the world, he remained for over two hundred years.\n\nIn the twenty-fourth year of King Zhao’s reign, the year *guichou* of the Great Year cycle, on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth month, the Venerable Master Yin, Keeper of the Pass, expounded the *Five Thousand Character Text*.\n\nThe text emerges from the beginningless, and its exposition knows no end. Concealed in brightness or hidden in obscurity, wisdom returns to its source. The compassionate intent responds to resonance, now manifest, now subtle. Its proclamation and practice extend to all, yet transmissions differ. Each follows its own understanding—take care not to disparage others.\n\nOnly through diligent reflection and careful recollection of what is known, with long practice and divine descent, may one receive the essential words. Naturally, the mysterious mirror becomes penetratingly clear, the wellspring of wisdom.\n\nThe precepts, rituals, and methods number twenty-four in all, aiding the completion of the Three Vehicles. They are suited to the upper, middle, and lower grades, each according to its use. For those of middling capacity and below, brevity may lead to many transgressions; for those of middling capacity and above, diligent practice knows no abandonment. Unwavering resolve arises from steadfast will, and courageous vigor enables universal salvation—this is the talent of the Great Vehicle, the aspiration of the wise.\n\nThose of shallow understanding and indolent weakness cannot accomplish great works. Their progress is meager, and once fallen, return is difficult. The middle and lesser vehicles are already inferior in merit; how much more so for the common and base—how could they be companions?\n\nThose of lofty contemplation and enlightened minds must propagate the wondrous Dharma, transcending the Three Realms to stand among the highest sages.\n\n**Preface to the Sequence of Scriptures and Methods, First**\n\nIn primordial antiquity, affairs were few, and methods were not numerous. As time turned and customs grew decadent, regulations and precepts emerged in succession. Remedies were prescribed according to illness, their weight varying. Techniques accumulated, and statutes multiplied. Such is the course of worldly change—it cannot be abruptly reformed.\n\nThe sagely teachers of utmost virtue, adapting to circumstances, proclaimed and practiced accordingly. While the Dao abhors excessive elaboration, principle values simplicity and essentials. Essentials are not common, and what they reveal is vast and flourishing. The foolish cannot fathom them, yet the wise and foolish may interconnect. Complexity and simplicity must be balanced, and balance lies in correctness. Correctness lies in freedom from perversity; perversity and correctness are understood through comprehensive mastery. Mastery leads to the Dao, and the Dao knows no obstruction. Those who cling to little reproach much, and those who grasp much ridicule little—neither are masters of the Dao. All pertain to the substance of the Dao. Contemplate this intent, and you will surely move the divine spirits. When the divine spirits open the Dao, you will ascend to the sublime realm.\n\nNow, the correct text is compiled and transmitted in ten scrolls, together with the revealed true scriptures, all issuing from the sacred mouth. Practice diligently what is good, and you will encounter no confusion.\n\nFormerly, Master Yin first received the *Three Great Characters*, with the *Middle Scripture* residing in the *Taiqing* section. Thus, the upper and lower scrolls were transmitted in Han script. Through refined devotion, a perfected person descended to impart these verses. Where there was obstruction, it was dissolved, and one ascended to the Golden Flower, befriending the gods and immortals of heaven.\n\nThe *Hidden Commentary* states: Reading a single chapter of the *River Lord* pierces through to the Jade Capital of the Supreme. The immortals of the various heavens clasp their hands in praise, their voices resounding through the Three Realms. Demon kings bow in the void, and the lords of Fengdu pay reverence, prostrating before the Dharma master.\n\nHuman life is beset by obstructions, yet mastery of the verses can dissolve them. Thus, it follows the *Great Characters*.\n\nThe master’s attainment of the Dao led to its propagation in Western Shu. The customs of Shu were shallow and crude, unable to grasp profound speech. He entrusted the *Xiang’er* to instruct the newly converted. The newly converted, much like the shallow folk of Shu, required direct and accessible language. Adapting to circumstances, he expounded the Three Grades of Essential Precepts, a great vessel to ferry the multitude. Thus, it follows the *River Lord*.\n\nThe *River Lord* and *Xiang’er* differ in their commentaries, and the *Great Characters* vary in style and meaning. All respond to the needs of their time, evolving instruction into meaning. Though their texts diverge, they converge in purpose. Each attains what it can: where both may be grasped, grasp both; where only one may be understood, understand that one.\n\nPartial understanding may eventually return, but comprehensive mastery does not. Beware of ridicule, for ridicule invites transgression. Birth and death bring suffering; liberation from suffering and ascent to joy depend on thorough mastery. The path to mastery is long, and immediate clarity is not to be expected. Simply cultivate this without disparaging that—this is the highest good.\n\nThe highest good flourishes in both refinement and plainness, embracing emptiness and fullness, ultimately uniting with the true source. If the times are ornate, speech may be florid; if the world is plain, words may be simple. Some urge plainness toward refinement, others temper refinement with plainness. Some begin concisely and expand later, first giving and then taking away; others start abundantly and conclude sparingly, beginning with departure and ending without return. Great skill appears clumsy, and is not easily mocked. Correct speech seems contradictory—how could it be questioned? Only through courageous and vigorous contemplation may one aspire to comprehensive understanding, with the resolve to pierce the Jade Capital, fearing no lack of mastery.\n\nMastery of the great Dao is the highest attainment. Methods of contemplation, transmission of teachings, morning rites, purification invocations—all have their proper forms.\n\nStudying these ten scrolls suffices for comprehensive mastery. Where understanding is incomplete, diligent inquiry will complete it. If inquiry is not yet refined, one must rely on abundant causes. By steadfastly cultivating abundant causes, the wondrous fruit will surely be attained. The wondrous fruit has its season—no need to seek elsewhere. If the season of fruition has not arrived, peruse the various chapters. As for the initial introduction and inner explanations, they are arranged separately afterward. With remaining effort, one may observe them—there is no harm in doing so.\n\nWhat must be kept in mind is listed as follows:\n\n**First Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**\n\n**Upper Scroll of the Great Character Edition of the Laozi’s Dao Scripture**\n**Second Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**\n\n**Lower Scroll of the Great Character Edition of the Laozi’s Virtue Scripture**\n**Third Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**\n\n**Upper and Lower Scrolls of the Laozi’s Dao Scripture with He Shanggong’s Chapter-and-Verse Commentary**\n**Fourth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**\n\n**Upper and Lower Scrolls of the Laozi’s Virtue Scripture with He Shanggong’s Chapter-and-Verse Commentary**\n**Fifth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**\n\n**Upper Scroll of the Laozi’s Dao Scripture with Xiang’er’s Instructions**\n**Sixth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**\n\n**Lower Scroll of the Laozi’s Virtue Scripture with Xiang’er’s Instructions**\n**Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**\n\n**Laozi’s Contemplation of the Spirit: Illustrated Annotations and Oral Instructions**\n**Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**\n\n**Laozi’s Transmission of Scriptures and Precepts: Annotated Ritual Instructions**\n**Ninth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**\n\n**Laozi’s Natural Audience Rites: Annotated Ritual Instructions**\n**Tenth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**\n\nThese ten scrolls are to be assessed and conferred by the master on the day of scripture transmission. When receiving the scriptures, do not make reckless inquiries. At that time, the officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the bureaus of the ten directions, and all divine administrators within and beyond the Three Realms will together oversee and examine one’s goodness and evil, words and deeds. Maintain utmost reverence and solemnity; do not procrastinate or shift blame onto one another. If any obstruction arises, once the matter is concluded, consult carefully. The master will explain and clarify. Should anything be forgotten or omitted, immediately consult the scriptural regulations and adhere to the original text—do not arbitrarily add or remove. No alterations or inconsistencies may be made; disorder or confusion in sequence is forbidden. To conceal faults and mislead sentient beings, entangling one another in suffering and poison, is to lose the path of blessing. To seek restoration would be as difficult as retrieving a boulder fallen into the sea. The gravity of transgression and suffering is to be feared; one must guard against it with care. Examine and deliberate with meticulous caution, so that both the hidden and manifest may be known. Do not deceive or betray humans and spirits. Those who can do so will surely attain perfection together.\n\nThe essential and wondrous teachings are often transmitted orally. What is spoken orally is encompassed within the scriptures. The literary garden is profound; verbal elucidation is necessary. The oral instructions must align with the scriptures and not transgress canonical bounds. What is required at any given moment may derive from other sections. Ancient texts are difficult to encounter; searching for them is often in vain. This ritual outline broadly encompasses the fundamental principles of the tradition. The wise who reflect upon it will avoid more than half of all errors.\n\n**Second: The Ritual of Transmission and Purification**\n\nThe weight of transmission is revered by sages and worthies. Noble persons and gentlemen honor it with purification. The offerings during purification may be abundant or modest, arranged according to the occasion. The great Dao is pure and empty; simplicity is paramount. For those undertaking long-term purification, whether foolish or wise, transmission should be preceded by a formal request. If one has already aligned their mind and conduct for a prolonged period, diligently serving the master’s gate, no separate purification rite need be established. Those of shared aspiration and mutual assurance will encourage one another, and many worthies will arise. Merit is easily accomplished. To study alone is to remain isolated and shallow; ascending the path of the Dao is difficult. If the conditions are not yet complete, and no suitable person is found, the master and disciple should purify together, applying focused contemplation. This is far superior to peripheral assistance.\n\nIf engaged in worldly affairs, teaching, or learning, those involved in transmission should first purify together. This is a shared cultivation, a profound understanding that transcends the mere quietude of two individuals. One should invite the master’s friends, disciples, and family members—men and women—according to what one can provide, even up to an unlimited number. The ritual limit is thirty-eight persons; no fewer than six may participate. Six persons constitute a proper purification rite: one serves as the master, and five as guarantors.\n\nWhat are guarantors? They are treasures, bearers, illuminators, witnesses, deliverers, and perfected ones. They are as precious as treasures, capable of bearing the teachings. They clarify sincerity, affirm good conduct, deliver one from trials, and perfect one’s attainment of the utmost truth. If dwelling in mountains or valleys, one may form a bond as strong as metal in the presence of the landscape. In remote or solitary places, two or three may suffice, provided they share the same aspiration. Outsiders must not be included, lest discord arise and good deeds be disrupted. The master and disciple should carefully deliberate together.\n\nPurification rites may last nine, seven, five, or three days. A one-day rite is not permitted. A one-day gathering, though an assembly, is not a purification; it is merely the distribution of wealth to feed the worthy, called a *meeting*. For a one-day purification, official documents must be submitted, and supervisory officials invited. In effect, a one-day purification involves three days of preparation.\n\n**Third: The Method of Inviting the Master and Guarantors**\n\nWhen receiving the Dao and conducting purification rites, choose an auspicious day—one governed by the waxing and waning of the moon, the first day of the lunar month, or the full moon. If matters must be expedited, selection may be omitted. However, when inviting the master and guarantors, those who should attend may be difficult to assemble, while the unworthy are easily summoned. One must focus the mind, pray for the descent of worthy virtue, and submit petitions on the appointed day, following the usual ritual forms.\n\nThe invited persons are listed in order as follows:\n\n1. **Three Masters**: Comprising three persons—one as the principal master, one as the supervising master, and one as the witnessing master.\n2. **Five Guarantors**: Comprising five persons serving as general lecturers.\n3. **Six Illuminators**: Comprising six persons serving as purification supervisors.\n4. **Seven Witnesses**: Comprising seven persons serving as scripture attendants.\n5. **Eight Deliverers**: Comprising eight persons serving as incense attendants.\n6. **Nine Perfected**: Comprising nine persons serving as lamp attendants.\n\nThese six ranks total thirty-eight persons. If unable to assemble the full number, adjust according to circumstances. All should be the master’s fellow students, persons of high virtue and close acquaintance, or those whose spiritual wisdom is complete, whose talents are outstanding. They should jointly sign the pledge, encouraging and exhorting one another, honoring them as masters and calling them *Venerable Ones*. They are presented with cloths and knives to wipe away dust and grime, sever entanglements, untie the nets of affliction, and break through the webs of obstruction. The meaning lies in liberation and carefree clarity.\n\nThose of shallow understanding and limited learning must not presume to occupy these ranks. They may temporarily participate in the purification and serve as guarantors but may not sign the pledge or receive the offerings of cloths and knives. They should remain among the ordinary purification officials.\n\n**Fourth: The Method of Transcribing Scriptures**\n\nWithin the three-day period allotted for a purification rite, if the transcription of scriptures is not yet complete, begin with the precepts, followed by the audience rites. Those within the master’s gate may transcribe in reverse order, gradually completing the task. It need not be finished during the purification itself.\n\nIf the transcription effort during the purification period is insufficient, one may enlist others’ help. Should suitable assistants be difficult to find, after the purification and upon receiving the scriptures, gradually seek out skilled scribes—pure and disciplined Daoist practitioners or devout and trustworthy individuals—to reside in seclusion. Ensure all materials are pristine and new. They shall personally request the scripture scrolls from the master, bowing to receive each one and bowing again upon its completion. With reverence and care, they must transcribe every section of the received texts, using fine silk or paper as the medium. Once the paper is fully prepared, the master shall hand-copy one complete version to bestow upon the disciple, and the disciple shall hand-copy another to offer to the master’s lineage. Given the arduous nature of this labor, if one’s calligraphy is unskilled, hiring a scribe is permissible, provided the transcription is meticulously proofread. Take heed not to omit or err, for mistakes will shorten one’s lifespan, invite calamity, and incur severe penalties. Proofread five or even ten times, ensuring alignment through study and recitation. The mysterious spirits will then protect the practitioner, prolonging life and attaining sagehood, benefiting all beings—not merely oneself.\n\nUpon receiving these scriptures and precepts, prepare two copies of each: one for permanent enshrinement, stored in a cypress-wood case placed on a high table or stand near the altar, or sealed on a separate platform, never to be opened carelessly. If airing or purification is required, perform it during a purification rite, then reseal them securely. The second copy may be kept at hand for study, recitation, and reflection during purifications. The paper, silk, dyes, bindings, scroll rods, wrappings, and storage boxes must all remain pure and undefiled, never mixed with other items. Unless shared among like-minded practitioners, never lend them. Theft or unauthorized copying incurs grave sin. Should the texts decay, replace them promptly; failure to do so risks damnation in the abyss or confinement in dark caverns. If lost, repent immediately, undertake merit through transcription, and reject any divergent teachings from later masters—even if they claim attainment, such deviations are forbidden. Those who do not fully comprehend should simply maintain reverent offerings. Uphold the oaths sworn to former masters; never betray them. With all masters united in one heart, transcend the Three Realms.\n\n**Fifth: The Method of Writing Memorials**\nUse yellow silk measuring two feet and five inches in length. The text’s length may vary as needed. Write in red ink within red borders, following standard memorial formatting. If divided into twenty-four sections of four parts each, it is even better. Address the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor as \"Celestial Worthy.\" For these four titles, suspend a single character above the rest; other titles need not be suspended. Do not add dots to repeated characters, nor reveal capital offenses or duplicate names. Adjust spacing to ensure balance, with ample room between lines. For the most revered titles, leave two inches at the bottom and three inches at the top. Follow the prescribed spacing: one character’s width between sections, one inch below the \"bow\" character to accommodate the \"petition\" character, which should be suspended. If too close to the bottom, shift upward. Arrange nine lines in three sections, adhering to standard formatting—this is also called a \"chapter.\" For memorials to the Three Masters, use white silk as the outer layer; paper is also acceptable. Memorials may be written by hand.\n\n**Sixth: The Method of Recording the Three Masters’ Names**\nOn the first day of the month in the year of [Year], [Month], under the reign of [Celestial Stem and Branch], the disciple [Name], [Age] years old, from [Prefecture, County, Village], male/female, received the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Virtue*, the Threefold Essential Precepts, at [Mountain, Lodge, or Residence] in [Prefecture, County, Village]. The names of the Three Masters are as follows:\n\n**Preceptor (度师):**\nDaoist Master [Title], [Name], [Age] years old, from [Prefecture, County, Village], with the style [Style Name].\n\n**Registrar (籍师):**\nDaoist Master [Title], [Name], [Age] years old, from [Prefecture, County, Village], with the style [Style Name].\n\n**Scripture Master (经师):**\nDaoist Master [Title], [Name], [Age] years old, from [Prefecture, County, Village], with the style [Style Name].\n\nRecord this in black ink on yellow silk, five inches in width.\n\n**Seventh: The Method of Preparing Offerings**\nProvide five zhang of white silk. The Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate stated: The transmission protocol for the *Five Thousand Characters*, as passed down by immortals, requires the same offering of silk as the *Lingbao* scriptures. For those of exceptional talent who diligently recite and seek the Dao of spontaneous transcendence, prepare fifty chi of white silk as an offering, to be presented alongside the *Lingbao* scriptures during a purification rite at a renowned mountain. If circumstances prevent receiving the *Lingbao* scriptures, one may directly receive the *Scripture of the Dao and Virtue* during a home purification, without requiring a mountain retreat.\n\nThe offerings serve three purposes: first, to relinquish wealth in pursuit of the Dao, gradually cultivating superior virtue; second, to derive instruction from the offerings, deepening understanding and entering the lineage; third, to refine existence through comparison, discarding obstacles to attain liberation. The use of silk symbolizes reverence for the mysterious and near, while fifty chi aligns with cosmic principles. Clarity in these principles exhausts the profound, harmonizing existence and non-existence, thus ascending to sublime realms. Through this, both Daoists and laity achieve salvation.\n\nDisciples within and beyond the master’s gate differ, yet their differences converge, and their similarities diverge. Some outside may be diligent, while some inside may be indolent. Indolence leads to superficiality despite frequent practice, while diligence fosters intimacy despite distance. Cultivating virtue through proximity to the virtuous hinges on these distinctions. The diligent need not rely on offerings to clarify their resolve, while the indolent should use offerings to strengthen their will. The indolent must not be hindered by material concerns, nor should the diligent yet be able to relinquish them entirely. Some may be poor despite favorable circumstances, while others, though wealthy, require encouragement. Teachers, friends, and kin may assist in providing offerings, dispersing them according to the method to inspire merit-making. Praising and promoting this practice deepens its virtue.\n\nIf silk is unavailable in impoverished regions, substitute other items of equivalent value. If temporarily lacking, replenish later. Those who pursue the Dao with equanimity, embrace poverty, and follow their master—valuing worth over material goods—may proceed without offerings. If nothing is available, simply declare one’s intent to receive the teachings, and a discerning master will understand. Do not violate the oaths sworn to former masters; with all masters united in one heart, transcend the Three Realms.\n\n**Eighth: Items Required for Ordination**\nOne green silk cord, braided from eight strands, totaling nine chi in length.\nOne gold clasp, one cun in diameter. If unavailable, use standard metalwork of any size, provided it is genuine gold.\nOne knife and one mallet. The mallet should be made of firm wood such as sandalwood, ebony, or rosewood. The knife should be of sufficient sharpness to pierce the clasp.\n\nSilk paper and brush, thread: the paper is used to wrap the forged clasp, the thread to bind it; the brush records the year, month, day, and name on the exterior, noting \"Five Thousand Character Clasp.\" Vermilion or ink may be used as preferred.\n\n**Cinnabar Water Set:**\nOne liang of cinnabar, first ground and blended in a bowl until smooth, then transferred to a vessel for ordination, adjusted to proper thickness and filled to over half its capacity.\n\n**Hand Towels and Knives:**\nAs many as the master and guardians require, with each person receiving one towel and one knife.\n\nThe above six items must all be new and clean, free from public or private contamination, and prepared in advance. Do not wait until the last moment to press for them, lest you disrupt the celestial rites and bring misfortune upon host and guest alike—regret will come too late. First labor, then ease; do not shrink from initial effort. Friends should assist one another, offering mutual support, carefully considering and ensuring all ritual implements are sufficient.\n\n**Ninth: The Ritual Attire**\nAttire is the adornment of the body. Daoists and laypersons must not intermingle their garments. For those who leave the worldly life, one set suffices. As for those like Lu Tong who let their hair loose, or those who merely preserve their form, whether they possess such attire or not is unrestricted. For those who engage with the world while remaining at home, no more than three sets are permitted. If one exceeds three, they must promptly be given away. To accumulate and then disperse transforms falsity into truth. True persons establishing teachings and cultivating themselves to lead others require two sets. Always keep them new and clean, and when they wear out, give them away. They may only be bestowed upon those who uphold the Dao; to give them to those who do not is to defile the true and upright—guard against this strictly. If no suitable recipient is found, purify them by fire according to the rites.\n\nThis principle applies not only to clothing but also to dwellings, mats, curtains, bedding, shoes, blankets, eating vessels, and written documents—whatever is fit to give, give away; what is unfit, purify.\n\n**Headscarves, Hats, and Garments:**\nRobes, skirts, undergarments, arm wraps, and other items—each should have two sets. One set is kept separately in another room and worn only during rituals, removed afterward. Store them in separate chests or baskets, keeping inner and outer garments apart. Ensure all are fragrant, clean, and well-ordered, with sizes, thickness, and materials (cloth or silk) chosen appropriately for the season. The wealthy must not be extravagant, nor the poor shabby; seek moderation and balance, following the master’s example. From the outset of receiving the teachings, one should prepare these items. If one is poor and cannot obtain everything at once, prioritize the essentials for the ordination hall, roughly as follows: a kudzu-fiber headscarf, a single-layer robe, a quilt, shoes, and a hand tablet. These five items must all be new and clean; do not use old or worn ones.\n\nWhen Lord Lao departed Zhou, and Zuo Ci lived in Wei, both wore kudzu-fiber headscarves and single-layer robes, never donning coarse cloth. Thus, from the Son of Heaven to the common people, all followed this practice. To \"wear coarse cloth while holding jade\" is a matter of individual capacity. For women, cinnamon skirts, yellow lower garments, and black shoes are appropriate; gold, jade, brocade, and embroidery are forbidden as adornments.\n\n**Tenth: The Method of Presenting Oneself and Submitting a Petition to the Master**\nFor all who receive the wondrous teachings, one must go to the master’s gate; one must not humble the esteemed or bend to visit a humble abode. If the master is a traveling Dharma teacher, one may extend an invitation as circumstances allow. When coming to study, one’s resolve must be firm; when going to teach, one’s burden is light. Those who attain the heart while forgetting boundaries are rare, so one must be deeply cautious.\n\nIf the fast lasts a full day, master and disciple must agree on the sequence of rituals, the method of offerings, and the items to be presented—enough to express one’s intent. Before the fast begins, one should have ample time to deliberate. If master or disciple faces an urgent matter, the duration of the fast may be shortened or extended—three periods or six periods, as one is able. On the evening of the initial gathering, present the petition according to the rites, writing and treating it with reverence, as detailed in the *Natural Rites*. The content of the petition may be expanded or condensed as needed, following the old text as a model. The ancient version is as follows:\n\nThis text was transmitted by the Four White-Haired Ones and differs from that recorded in the *Natural Secrets*. Master Le used this version, and it is fitting to compare it with the *Natural Secrets* to determine the proper balance.\n\n*\"The Three Caverns Dharma Master, [Master of Such-and-Such Peak], [Such-and-Such Ordination Master], [Daoist of Such-and-Such Qi and Such-and-Such Teaching], [So-and-So] of [Such-and-Such Record], a disciple of the Dao, male or female, a humble servant of [Such-and-Such Age], born in the year [Such-and-Such], on the [Such-and-Such] day of the [Such-and-Such] month at [Such-and-Such] hour, now residing in [Such-and-Such] Prefecture, [Such-and-Such] County, [Such-and-Such] Village, at [Such-and-Such] Palace, Mansion, Abode, Mountain, or Garrison—prostrating in reverence, I humbly submit this petition to seek the Dao, confessing my sins:*\n\n*By the causes of accumulated goodness, I have been blessed to encounter the profound transformation of the Three Treasures in this life, leaping with joy and delight. Though I am of lowly and foolish nature, I aspire to distant learning and higher studies. I have heard that the *Five Thousand Character Dao and Virtue Classic* is profound and far-reaching, and I humbly seek to receive it to fulfill my sincerest devotion. Respectfully following the Dharma treasure and the fast, I submit this petition, beseeching the Dharma Master to bestow completion upon me. Humbly submitted, I present myself at the gate of the Great High and Mysterious Dharma Master [Such-and-Such].\"*\n\n*\"In the year [Such-and-Such], the [Such-and-Such] month, [Such-and-Such] day, and [Such-and-Such] hour, at [Such-and-Such] Mountain in [Such-and-Such] Prefecture, [Such-and-Such] County, [Such-and-Such] Village, this petition is presented.\"*\n\n**Eleventh: The Method of Adjusting the Fast Ritual**\nThough the fast for receiving the Dao follows the *Natural Rites*, the preliminary announcements, the three offerings of incense, the invocations to the Ten Directions, and the Great Repentance Text should be expanded or condensed as circumstances require.\n\nIf the master has not yet received the registers, or if the ordination qi is incomplete, the fast does not conclude with the \"exit from office\" ritual, and no merit is declared. The form of declaring merit begins with an apology for inadequacy. It is also said that after the completion of past affairs, one returns to the body of the servant—this refers to the \"recovery of control,\" which occurs *after* the conclusion of the ritual. At the start of the fast, one must not immediately perform the \"recovery\" and \"exit from office.\" At the end, it is said: \"Merit Officers, Envoys, Flying Dragon Riders, and Scribes, having completed the presentation of affairs, each return to the servant’s body\"—this pertains to the transmission of the fast’s intent and concludes with their return, unrelated to the officials of the fast’s protective retinue.\n\nThe officials of the fast’s retinue attend until its completion, and only after all matters are concluded is merit declared and control recovered. If no \"exit from office\" is performed, one may simply recite the secret prayers, offer incense at the recovery brazier, and present petitions and vows; the rest of the rites remain the same.\n\n**Twelfth: The Method of Submitting a Memorial After the Fast**\nWhen transmitting the scriptures, one should do so after the fast’s allotted time, at dawn following the morning salutations and the completion of the circumambulation. One must not declare merit or recover the brazier prematurely. For a three-period fast, the morning rites are observed at dawn; for a six-period fast, the morning circumambulation is performed at dawn.\n\nAt the commencement of the fast, when exiting office, one must not yet declare merit; if office is not exited, the brazier may not yet be recovered. The master then faces north, takes three pinches of incense, and upon completing the offering, returns to kneel in obeisance. After a brief seated pause, the five guarantors of the fast, still facing west, likewise sit briefly. The recipient of the scriptures approaches the master’s south side, facing north in prostration—women prostrate in the same manner as the master. The master sounds the drum thirty-six times and reads the memorial as follows:\n\nThis is the method for the hall. If exiting the altar to perform the rites, the master faces north, male disciples prostrate to the left facing east, and female disciples prostrate to the right facing west; they may not follow the same protocol as the master. If the altar is over a hundred paces from the hall, those who exited office during the fast declare merit and recover the brazier within the hall. Upon ascending the altar for a second exit from office, if the master has not overseen the canopy, he does not exit office; those who do not exit office enter the prayers, ignite the brazier, take incense, briefly sit facing north, sound the drum, and read the memorial.\n\nIf the altar is within a hundred paces, the morning salutations and circumambulation may be performed upon the altar. For rites conducted in the fast hall, the memorial is read facing north. On the day of altar dissolution, after the morning salutations and circumambulation are complete, one exits. If other matters remain unresolved or adjustments to public or private affairs are needed, one may wait until the midday salutations are concluded, then enter the hall or altar as fully prescribed, adhering to the procedures of the morning circumambulation. If wind or rain interrupts the morning rites, perform the salutations and circumambulation in the hall as prescribed; if the weather clears later in the day, ascend the altar in tranquility, enter the prayers, ignite the brazier, exit office, and submit the memorial. Unless it is a formal occasion, one need not perform the morning rites but may simply ignite the brazier, exit office, and proceed as outlined in the regulations. Only after the transmission of scriptures is complete does one recover office; those who did not exit office require no recovery.\n\nSince the fast’s commencement has already been announced, there is no need to exit office again. Once all matters are concluded, recover the brazier and depart. If ascending the altar at dawn before completing the morning salutations and circumambulation, and wind, rain, or calamity disrupts the rites, after the dismissal, maintain composure and proceed thus: perform the morning rites and circumambulation with dried provisions, then, upon completion, read the memorial.\n\n**Thirteenth: The Method of the Memorial’s Original Text**\n\nThe Three Caverns Master of [specific] Mountain, [Name], respectfully undertakes the *Scripture of Dao and Virtue in Five Thousand Characters*.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns are titled \"Cavern Spirit,\" the Numinous Treasure \"Cavern Mystery,\" and the Jade Clarity \"Cavern Truth.\" Those who receive these are called \"Three Caverns\"; those who have not received them are simply styled \"Master of the Supreme Dao and Virtue.\" After receiving the Dao, one becomes a master; upon ordaining a full number of disciples, the master submits a memorial reporting merits and virtues, thereby qualifying as a master. Only then may one be titled \"Dharma Master\"; those who have not done so may not serve as masters for others. If serving as the fast’s sponsor, one may only be called \"Disciple of the Three Treasures\" and may not be titled \"Dharma Master.\"\n\nIf one has received even a portion of the Three Caverns, one may state, \"Disciple undertakes the *Five Thousand Characters*.\" Without such reception, one may not presumptuously adopt the title. Upon receiving the Lord Lao and one, two, or all three caverns, one is titled \"Master of the Supreme Dao and Virtue\" and undertakes the affairs of the Three Caverns. Men refer to themselves as \"your servant,\" women as \"your handmaid.\"\n\nWomen at home have their reckoning periods, and upon marriage, distinctions arise between wives and concubines; yet in self-reference, all uniformly use \"handmaid.\" What is a handmaid? One who connects, swiftly attends, diligently serves superiors, fulfills commands, assists with alacrity, and does not linger, idle, or rest—lest she deviate from the true Dao. Unmarried women studying the Dao are called \"female students\"; those who have not received the registers are all called \"disciples.\" All use their father’s surname; married women use their husband’s surname. Those who leave their husbands revert to their original surname. Concubines may not honor their lords and thus do not adopt their lord’s surname. If a widow receives the Dao after her husband’s death, she may not sever ties with her husband and must retain his surname. If she remarries and later becomes principal, she may change her surname only after receiving the registers; if she has already received them, she must submit a memorial to the Great Dao before adopting a new surname. If granted a clan by a superior, she must likewise memorialize the Great Dao before using it. Previous documents need not be retroactively altered; the Three Officials, knowing the memorial has been submitted, will consult the source and issue decrees accordingly, sparing future documents the burden of redundant annotations or interlinear notes, thereby preserving the singularity of intent.\n\nWomen who receive the Dao and qualify as masters are titled similarly to men, with \"Dharma Master\" and \"Master.\" As for titles such as \"Primordial Sovereign,\" \"Lady,\" and others, each differs. The title \"Master\" signifies preeminent virtue, preceding others, enduring and imperishable—hence \"Master.\" One may not self-designate; like the Five Peaks, after years of cultivation, one’s virtue permeates the age, revered by both hidden and manifest realms. Only when masters and peers jointly memorialize to confer the title \"Master\" may one adopt it. If one’s birth year does not align with the governing peak, yet one’s spiritual attainments and teachings transform all directions, one need not adhere to peak-specific titles. The following twelve titles are the most exalted among all:\n\n*Transcendent Wanderer, Mystic Flourisher, Far-Ranging, Peak-Ranger, Vast Dao, Dao and Virtue, Perfected Communion, True Recluse, Supreme, Non-Action, Utmost, Orthodox Unity.*\n\nThese twelve titles are the highest among all appellations. Countless other titles, numbering in the tens of thousands, may be established according to merit and circumstances; they cannot all be enumerated here. Without the recommendation of masters and peers, one may not presumptuously adopt them.\n\nBow twice, prostrate, and rise to speak. After completing the obeisances, kneel lengthily and read the memorial’s opening address to the Supreme. After reading the petition, sit briefly, then rise and bow again.\n\nThe memorial begins:\n\nTo the Supreme, Boundless, Utmost Real, Unsurpassed, Non-Action Great Dao; the Lofty Sage, Mystic Numinous Nine Heavens Illuminated King; the Jade Emperor; the Thirty-Nine Perfected of the Upper Numinous; the Mystic Spirits of the Thirty-Two Heavens; the Eighty-One Lords; the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors; the Thirty-Six Earthly Sovereigns; the Myriad Immortal Dao Lords; the Inspecting Numinous Envoys; the Jade Lads Attending the Immortals; the Overseers of the Perfected; the Inspecting Saints; the Perfected Officials Attending the Scriptures; the Wondrous Lords of the Great Veil; the Responsive Perfected Essences; the Boundless Hosts of Great Saints who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions; and all the divine beings within and beyond the Three Realms:\n\nYour servant, by fortunate birth, has encountered this truth, received the scriptures and precepts, and day and night observes them, praising and propagating the wondrous transformation to deliver heaven and humanity. Though my talent is slight and my burden heavy, my trepidation runs deep. Relying on the Great Dao’s boundless compassion, I devote my heart and exhaust my strength, vowing to propagate it without slack. Given the circumstances, how dare I not submit this account? Now, with this memorial, my words are earnest, my aspirations fervent. Your servant, overwhelmed by the profundity of the Primordial, offers this with utmost reverence.\n\nWith this memorial, I humbly submit my account:\n\nFormerly, your servant received instruction under Master So-and-so, and on such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, at such-and-such a place, was conferred the sacred scriptures of the Dao and its virtue, the precepts, rituals, and liturgical codes. When encountering worthy disciples, I transmitted them accordingly; when making dedications, I directed them toward the mysterious fulfillment of destiny. After receiving these teachings, I pledged in solemn covenant—swearing before the Nine Heavens—to uphold and cultivate them without fail.\n\nI have guarded my speech with vigilance, preserved the spirit by contemplating the true, diminished selfishness, and restrained desire, aspiring now to become a divine immortal. According to the ordained timeframe of the method—whether the six-by-four interval or the great reckoning of five and eight—should I encounter a worthy person, I shall, in accordance with the ritual statutes, submit a petition to the distant Nine Heavens. Only after verifying their sincerity and ensuring they are fully prepared in the Dharma may I transmit the teachings. I must not lightly disclose them or recklessly reveal them to the uninitiated.\n\nI hereby invoke the myriad spirits above and the Five Marchmounts below, along with the Three Rivers and Nine Springs, to bear witness as divine attestants. May this endeavor be accomplished and its merit fulfilled. Should I violate this covenant or betray its trust, may I and seven generations of my lineage together descend into perdition. The recipient of these scriptures, if named, shall be consigned to the ranks of the lowest ghosts, subjected to the scrutiny of attendant officials, made to tread the Mountain of Knives, dragged through the Forest of Swords, forced to consume fire and devour coals, embrace iron and plunge into boiling cauldrons, and traverse the Twenty-Four Hells for countless kalpas of suffering. I willingly accept these torments and dare not harbor resentment.\n\nIf, however, I cultivate in accordance with the Dharma and accumulate goodness, may the nine generations of my lineage ascend together. The recipient of these scriptures, if named, shall attain wisdom and enlightenment, prolong their lifespan, ascend as an immortal, and become a sage—a teacher of heaven and humanity. Their kin shall receive blessings, and all shall bear the grace of this transmission.\n\nWith this memorial, I humbly submit my account and await your response.\n\nYour servant, So-and-so, prostrates in awe and reverence, bows twice in submission, and respectfully presents this petition. Having bowed again, I remain kneeling to read the concluding text:\n\nYour servant, of the surname So-and-so, hailing from such-and-such prefecture, commandery, and county, now addresses the Most High, Formless and Nameless, the Void and Utmost True, the Supreme and Unsurpassed Primordial Honored One, the Golden Portal and Jeweled Jade Sovereign of the Seven Treasures.\n\nIn the year of the Great Year Star So-and-so, on the first day of such-and-such a month, at such-and-such an hour, from such-and-such prefecture, county, township, and village, I submit this memorial.\n\nThe transmission of the scriptures, precepts, and ritual instructions is now complete.\n\n*[Note: \"Laziness renders even the intimate distant.\"]*",

      "translated_text": "**Transmission Rituals and Precepts with Annotations and Secrets**\n**Text Title:** *Transmission Rituals and Precepts with Annotations and Secrets*\n**Full Title:** *The Supreme Mystery Section, Eighth Scroll: Lord Lao’s Transmission Rituals and Precepts with Annotations and Secrets*\n**Author:** Unknown, approximately from the Northern and Southern Dynasties period\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Orthodox Section, Part One\n\n---\n\n**Transmission Rituals and Precepts with Annotations and Secrets**\n\nThe Master says: Lord Lao is the great sage who attained the Dao, the teacher revered in both the hidden and manifest realms. When responding to conditions, he transforms and adapts to all directions; when his work is accomplished, he conceals himself and abides in constancy. Abiding without fixed abode, he is ever-present without absence. His presence in absence resides within the boundless; the extremity of the boundless culminates in the Supreme Mystery.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery is the capital where the great ancestral ultimate abides, the lord to which lesser lineages, not yet perfected, are guided and return. This capital is without limit, all-encompassing and complete, vast beyond comparison—hence it is called \"Supreme.\" Though existent, it is difficult to perceive—hence it is called \"Mystery.\" Though the ordinary eye cannot behold it, the eye of wisdom may discern it. Through studying scriptures, practicing good deeds, and maintaining mindfulness of the ancestral lord without momentary lapse, one attains this wisdom.\n\nThe lord is originally nameless, yet is designated as the \"Most High.\" When responding to conditions, he is thus named, and one gains the eye of wisdom. The fruit of wisdom arises from good causes; causes arise from an enlightened master. The master’s Dao is non-dual, and the scriptures are likewise unified, unified in the Dao and its virtue. The extremity of the Dao and virtue is the lord who completes the threefold union. The honored one who achieves unity resides in the capital of the Supreme Mystery, transforming and responding across the ten directions, unfolding the subtleties of being and non-being.\n\nThe subtlety culminates in the Venerable One, who is the ancestral master. The master’s essence is all-pervading, yet his attainment of the Dao is uniquely exalted—thus he is called the \"Supreme Mystery, Most High Lord Lao.\" Through accumulated study and cyclic cultivation, he ascends to the rank of sage and perfected one. His responses to the boundless are beyond description.\n\nIn recent kalpas, he manifested in the world, born during the Shang dynasty. Descending to blend with the world’s radiance, he was born among the common people, demonstrating the clarity of gestation and birth. Though dwelling in the lower realms, he attained the Dao without hindrance. His mother, wandering amidst the plum trees, heard the pure wind at the edge of the pine’s dust. His jade-like form shone brilliantly, his essence upright and unblemished, whole and without division, two bodies in perfect harmony. Thus, he took Li as his surname and Er (Ear) as his name, residing in Quren Village, Lai County, Ku Prefecture, in the state of Chu.\n\nHe traversed the six voids and taught across the three realms. Whether appearing in the world or departing from it, whether in action or non-action, he exhaustively investigated all. During the time of King Wen, he served as the Keeper of the Archives. Whether in retreat or in the world, he remained for over two hundred years.",

      "translated_text": "In the twenty-fourth year of King Zhao’s reign, the year *guichou* of the Great Year cycle, on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth month, the Venerable Master Yin, Keeper of the Pass, expounded the *Five Thousand Character Text*.\n\nThe text emerges from the beginningless, and its exposition knows no end. Concealed in brightness or hidden in obscurity, wisdom returns to its source. The compassionate intent responds to resonance, now manifest, now subtle. Its proclamation and practice extend to all, yet transmissions differ. Each follows its own understanding—take care not to disparage others.\n\nOnly through diligent reflection and careful recollection of what is known, with long practice and divine descent, may one receive the essential words. Naturally, the mysterious mirror becomes penetratingly clear, the wellspring of wisdom.\n\nThe precepts, rituals, and methods number twenty-four in all, aiding the completion of the Three Vehicles. They are suited to the upper, middle, and lower grades, each according to its use. For those of middling capacity and below, brevity may lead to many transgressions; for those of middling capacity and above, diligent practice knows no abandonment. Unwavering resolve arises from steadfast will, and courageous vigor enables universal salvation—this is the talent of the Great Vehicle, the aspiration of the wise.\n\nThose of shallow understanding and indolent weakness cannot accomplish great works. Their progress is meager, and once fallen, return is difficult. The middle and lesser vehicles are already inferior in merit; how much more so for the common and base—how could they be companions?\n\nThose of lofty contemplation and enlightened minds must propagate the wondrous Dharma, transcending the Three Realms to stand among the highest sages.\n\n**Preface to the Sequence of Scriptures and Methods, First**\n\nIn primordial antiquity, affairs were few, and methods were not numerous. As time turned and customs grew decadent, regulations and precepts emerged in succession. Remedies were prescribed according to illness, their weight varying. Techniques accumulated, and statutes multiplied. Such is the course of worldly change—it cannot be abruptly reformed.\n\nThe sagely teachers of utmost virtue, adapting to circumstances, proclaimed and practiced accordingly. While the Dao abhors excessive elaboration, principle values simplicity and essentials. Essentials are not common, and what they reveal is vast and flourishing. The foolish cannot fathom them, yet the wise and foolish may interconnect. Complexity and simplicity must be balanced, and balance lies in correctness. Correctness lies in freedom from perversity; perversity and correctness are understood through comprehensive mastery. Mastery leads to the Dao, and the Dao knows no obstruction. Those who cling to little reproach much, and those who grasp much ridicule little—neither are masters of the Dao. All pertain to the substance of the Dao. Contemplate this intent, and you will surely move the divine spirits. When the divine spirits open the Dao, you will ascend to the sublime realm.\n\nNow, the correct text is compiled and transmitted in ten scrolls, together with the revealed true scriptures, all issuing from the sacred mouth. Practice diligently what is good, and you will encounter no confusion.\n\nFormerly, Master Yin first received the *Three Great Characters*, with the *Middle Scripture* residing in the *Taiqing* section. Thus, the upper and lower scrolls were transmitted in Han script. Through refined devotion, a perfected person descended to impart these verses. Where there was obstruction, it was dissolved, and one ascended to the Golden Flower, befriending the gods and immortals of heaven.\n\nThe *Hidden Commentary* states: Reading a single chapter of the *River Lord* pierces through to the Jade Capital of the Supreme. The immortals of the various heavens clasp their hands in praise, their voices resounding through the Three Realms. Demon kings bow in the void, and the lords of Fengdu pay reverence, prostrating before the Dharma master.\n\nHuman life is beset by obstructions, yet mastery of the verses can dissolve them. Thus, it follows the *Great Characters*.\n\nThe master’s attainment of the Dao led to its propagation in Western Shu. The customs of Shu were shallow and crude, unable to grasp profound speech. He entrusted the *Xiang’er* to instruct the newly converted. The newly converted, much like the shallow folk of Shu, required direct and accessible language. Adapting to circumstances, he expounded the Three Grades of Essential Precepts, a great vessel to ferry the multitude. Thus, it follows the *River Lord*.\n\nThe *River Lord* and *Xiang’er* differ in their commentaries, and the *Great Characters* vary in style and meaning. All respond to the needs of their time, evolving instruction into meaning. Though their texts diverge, they converge in purpose. Each attains what it can: where both may be grasped, grasp both; where only one may be understood, understand that one.\n\nPartial understanding may eventually return, but comprehensive mastery does not. Beware of ridicule, for ridicule invites transgression. Birth and death bring suffering; liberation from suffering and ascent to joy depend on thorough mastery. The path to mastery is long, and immediate clarity is not to be expected. Simply cultivate this without disparaging that—this is the highest good.\n\nThe highest good flourishes in both refinement and plainness, embracing emptiness and fullness, ultimately uniting with the true source. If the times are ornate, speech may be florid; if the world is plain, words may be simple. Some urge plainness toward refinement, others temper refinement with plainness. Some begin concisely and expand later, first giving and then taking away; others start abundantly and conclude sparingly, beginning with departure and ending without return. Great skill appears clumsy, and is not easily mocked. Correct speech seems contradictory—how could it be questioned? Only through courageous and vigorous contemplation may one aspire to comprehensive understanding, with the resolve to pierce the Jade Capital, fearing no lack of mastery.\n\nMastery of the great Dao is the highest attainment. Methods of contemplation, transmission of teachings, morning rites, purification invocations—all have their proper forms.\n\nStudying these ten scrolls suffices for comprehensive mastery. Where understanding is incomplete, diligent inquiry will complete it. If inquiry is not yet refined, one must rely on abundant causes. By steadfastly cultivating abundant causes, the wondrous fruit will surely be attained. The wondrous fruit has its season—no need to seek elsewhere. If the season of fruition has not arrived, peruse the various chapters. As for the initial introduction and inner explanations, they are arranged separately afterward. With remaining effort, one may observe them—there is no harm in doing so.\n\nWhat must be kept in mind is listed as follows:\n\n**First Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**",

When receiving the scriptures, do not make reckless inquiries. At that time, the officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the bureaus of the ten directions, and all divine administrators within and beyond the Three Realms will together oversee and examine one’s goodness and evil, words and deeds. Maintain utmost reverence and solemnity; do not procrastinate or shift blame onto one another. If any obstruction arises, once the matter is concluded, consult carefully. The master will explain and clarify. Should anything be forgotten or omitted, immediately consult the scriptural regulations and adhere to the original text—do not arbitrarily add or remove. No alterations or inconsistencies may be made; disorder or confusion in sequence is forbidden. To conceal faults and mislead sentient beings, entangling one another in suffering and poison, is to lose the path of blessing. To seek restoration would be as difficult as retrieving a boulder fallen into the sea. The gravity of transgression and suffering is to be feared; one must guard against it with care. Examine and deliberate with meticulous caution, so that both the hidden and manifest may be known. Do not deceive or betray humans and spirits. Those who can do so will surely attain perfection together.\n\nThe essential and wondrous teachings are often transmitted orally. What is spoken orally is encompassed within the scriptures. The literary garden is profound; verbal elucidation is necessary. The oral instructions must align with the scriptures and not transgress canonical bounds. What is required at any given moment may derive from other sections. Ancient texts are difficult to encounter; searching for them is often in vain. This ritual outline broadly encompasses the fundamental principles of the tradition. The wise who reflect upon it will avoid more than half of all errors.\n\n**Second: The Ritual of Transmission and Purification**\n\nThe weight of transmission is revered by sages and worthies. Noble persons and gentlemen honor it with purification. The offerings during purification may be abundant or modest, arranged according to the occasion. The great Dao is pure and empty; simplicity is paramount. For those undertaking long-term purification, whether foolish or wise, transmission should be preceded by a formal request. If one has already aligned their mind and conduct for a prolonged period, diligently serving the master’s gate, no separate purification rite need be established. Those of shared aspiration and mutual assurance will encourage one another, and many worthies will arise. Merit is easily accomplished. To study alone is to remain isolated and shallow; ascending the path of the Dao is difficult. If the conditions are not yet complete, and no suitable person is found, the master and disciple should purify together, applying focused contemplation. This is far superior to peripheral assistance.\n\nIf engaged in worldly affairs, teaching, or learning, those involved in transmission should first purify together. This is a shared cultivation, a profound understanding that transcends the mere quietude of two individuals. One should invite the master’s friends, disciples, and family members—men and women—according to what one can provide, even up to an unlimited number. The ritual limit is thirty-eight persons; no fewer than six may participate. Six persons constitute a proper purification rite: one serves as the master, and five as guarantors.\n\nWhat are guarantors? They are treasures, bearers, illuminators, witnesses, deliverers, and perfected ones. They are as precious as treasures, capable of bearing the teachings. They clarify sincerity, affirm good conduct, deliver one from trials, and perfect one’s attainment of the utmost truth. If dwelling in mountains or valleys, one may form a bond as strong as metal in the presence of the landscape. In remote or solitary places, two or three may suffice, provided they share the same aspiration. Outsiders must not be included, lest discord arise and good deeds be disrupted. The master and disciple should carefully deliberate together.\n\nPurification rites may last nine, seven, five, or three days. A one-day rite is not permitted. A one-day gathering, though an assembly, is not a purification; it is merely the distribution of wealth to feed the worthy, called a *meeting*. For a one-day purification, official documents must be submitted, and supervisory officials invited. In effect, a one-day purification involves three days of preparation.\n\n**Third: The Method of Inviting the Master and Guarantors**\n\nWhen receiving the Dao and conducting purification rites, choose an auspicious day—one governed by the waxing and waning of the moon, the first day of the lunar month, or the full moon. If matters must be expedited, selection may be omitted. However, when inviting the master and guarantors, those who should attend may be difficult to assemble, while the unworthy are easily summoned. One must focus the mind, pray for the descent of worthy virtue, and submit petitions on the appointed day, following the usual ritual forms.\n\nThe invited persons are listed in order as follows:\n\n1. **Three Masters**: Comprising three persons—one as the principal master, one as the supervising master, and one as the witnessing master.\n2. **Five Guarantors**: Comprising five persons serving as general lecturers.\n3. **Six Illuminators**: Comprising six persons serving as purification supervisors.\n4. **Seven Witnesses**: Comprising seven persons serving as scripture attendants.\n5. **Eight Deliverers**: Comprising eight persons serving as incense attendants.\n6. **Nine Perfected**: Comprising nine persons serving as lamp attendants.\n\nThese six ranks total thirty-eight persons. If unable to assemble the full number, adjust according to circumstances. All should be the master’s fellow students, persons of high virtue and close acquaintance, or those whose spiritual wisdom is complete, whose talents are outstanding. They should jointly sign the pledge, encouraging and exhorting one another, honoring them as masters and calling them *Venerable Ones*. They are presented with cloths and knives to wipe away dust and grime, sever entanglements, untie the nets of affliction, and break through the webs of obstruction. The meaning lies in liberation and carefree clarity.\n\nThose of shallow understanding and limited learning must not presume to occupy these ranks. They may temporarily participate in the purification and serve as guarantors but may not sign the pledge or receive the offerings of cloths and knives. They should remain among the ordinary purification officials.\n\n**Fourth: The Method of Transcribing Scriptures**\n\nWithin the three-day period allotted for a purification rite, if the transcription of scriptures is not yet complete, begin with the precepts, followed by the audience rites. Those within the master’s gate may transcribe in reverse order, gradually completing the task. It need not be finished during the purification itself.",

If the season of fruition has not arrived, peruse the various chapters. As for the initial introduction and inner explanations, they are arranged separately afterward. With remaining effort, one may observe them—there is no harm in doing so.\n\nWhat must be kept in mind is listed as follows:\n\n**First Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Section**",

      "translated_text": "If the transcription effort during the purification period is insufficient, one may enlist others’ help. Should suitable assistants be difficult to find, after the purification and upon receiving the scriptures, gradually seek out skilled scribes—pure and disciplined Daoist practitioners or devout and trustworthy individuals—to reside in seclusion. Ensure all materials are pristine and new. They shall personally request the scripture scrolls from the master, bowing to receive each one and bowing again upon its completion. With reverence and care, they must transcribe every section of the received texts, using fine silk or paper as the medium. Once the paper is fully prepared, the master shall hand-copy one complete version to bestow upon the disciple, and the disciple shall hand-copy another to offer to the master’s lineage. Given the arduous nature of this labor, if one’s calligraphy is unskilled, hiring a scribe is permissible, provided the transcription is meticulously proofread. Take heed not to omit or err, for mistakes will shorten one’s lifespan, invite calamity, and incur severe penalties. Proofread five or even ten times, ensuring alignment through study and recitation. The mysterious spirits will then protect the practitioner, prolonging life and attaining sagehood, benefiting all beings—not merely oneself.\n\nUpon receiving these scriptures and precepts, prepare two copies of each: one for permanent enshrinement, stored in a cypress-wood case placed on a high table or stand near the altar, or sealed on a separate platform, never to be opened carelessly. If airing or purification is required, perform it during a purification rite, then reseal them securely. The second copy may be kept at hand for study, recitation, and reflection during purifications. The paper, silk, dyes, bindings, scroll rods, wrappings, and storage boxes must all remain pure and undefiled, never mixed with other items. Unless shared among like-minded practitioners, never lend them. Theft or unauthorized copying incurs grave sin. Should the texts decay, replace them promptly; failure to do so risks damnation in the abyss or confinement in dark caverns. If lost, repent immediately, undertake merit through transcription, and reject any divergent teachings from later masters—even if they claim attainment, such deviations are forbidden. Those who do not fully comprehend should simply maintain reverent offerings. Uphold the oaths sworn to former masters; never betray them. With all masters united in one heart, transcend the Three Realms.\n\n**Fifth: The Method of Writing Memorials**\nUse yellow silk measuring two feet and five inches in length. The text’s length may vary as needed. Write in red ink within red borders, following standard memorial formatting. If divided into twenty-four sections of four parts each, it is even better. Address the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor as \"Celestial Worthy.\" For these four titles, suspend a single character above the rest; other titles need not be suspended. Do not add dots to repeated characters, nor reveal capital offenses or duplicate names. Adjust spacing to ensure balance, with ample room between lines. For the most revered titles, leave two inches at the bottom and three inches at the top. Follow the prescribed spacing: one character’s width between sections, one inch below the \"bow\" character to accommodate the \"petition\" character, which should be suspended. If too close to the bottom, shift upward. Arrange nine lines in three sections, adhering to standard formatting—this is also called a \"chapter.\" For memorials to the Three Masters, use white silk as the outer layer; paper is also acceptable. Memorials may be written by hand.\n\n**Sixth: The Method of Recording the Three Masters’ Names**\nOn the first day of the month in the year of [Year], [Month], under the reign of [Celestial Stem and Branch], the disciple [Name], [Age] years old, from [Prefecture, County, Village], male/female, received the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Virtue*, the Threefold Essential Precepts, at [Mountain, Lodge, or Residence] in [Prefecture, County, Village]. The names of the Three Masters are as follows:\n\n**Preceptor (度师):**\nDaoist Master [Title], [Name], [Age] years old, from [Prefecture, County, Village], with the style [Style Name].\n\n**Registrar (籍师):**\nDaoist Master [Title], [Name], [Age] years old, from [Prefecture, County, Village], with the style [Style Name].\n\n**Scripture Master (经师):**\nDaoist Master [Title], [Name], [Age] years old, from [Prefecture, County, Village], with the style [Style Name].\n\nRecord this in black ink on yellow silk, five inches in width.\n\n**Seventh: The Method of Preparing Offerings**\nProvide five zhang of white silk. The Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate stated: The transmission protocol for the *Five Thousand Characters*, as passed down by immortals, requires the same offering of silk as the *Lingbao* scriptures. For those of exceptional talent who diligently recite and seek the Dao of spontaneous transcendence, prepare fifty chi of white silk as an offering, to be presented alongside the *Lingbao* scriptures during a purification rite at a renowned mountain. If circumstances prevent receiving the *Lingbao* scriptures, one may directly receive the *Scripture of the Dao and Virtue* during a home purification, without requiring a mountain retreat.\n\nThe offerings serve three purposes: first, to relinquish wealth in pursuit of the Dao, gradually cultivating superior virtue; second, to derive instruction from the offerings, deepening understanding and entering the lineage; third, to refine existence through comparison, discarding obstacles to attain liberation. The use of silk symbolizes reverence for the mysterious and near, while fifty chi aligns with cosmic principles. Clarity in these principles exhausts the profound, harmonizing existence and non-existence, thus ascending to sublime realms. Through this, both Daoists and laity achieve salvation.\n\nDisciples within and beyond the master’s gate differ, yet their differences converge, and their similarities diverge. Some outside may be diligent, while some inside may be indolent. Indolence leads to superficiality despite frequent practice, while diligence fosters intimacy despite distance. Cultivating virtue through proximity to the virtuous hinges on these distinctions. The diligent need not rely on offerings to clarify their resolve, while the indolent should use offerings to strengthen their will. The indolent must not be hindered by material concerns, nor should the diligent yet be able to relinquish them entirely. Some may be poor despite favorable circumstances, while others, though wealthy, require encouragement. Teachers, friends, and kin may assist in providing offerings, dispersing them according to the method to inspire merit-making. Praising and promoting this practice deepens its virtue.\n\nIf silk is unavailable in impoverished regions, substitute other items of equivalent value. If temporarily lacking, replenish later. Those who pursue the Dao with equanimity, embrace poverty, and follow their master—valuing worth over material goods—may proceed without offerings. If nothing is available, simply declare one’s intent to receive the teachings, and a discerning master will understand. Do not violate the oaths sworn to former masters; with all masters united in one heart, transcend the Three Realms.\n\n**Eighth: Items Required for Ordination**\nOne green silk cord, braided from eight strands, totaling nine chi in length.\nOne gold clasp, one cun in diameter. If unavailable, use standard metalwork of any size, provided it is genuine gold.\nOne knife and one mallet. The mallet should be made of firm wood such as sandalwood, ebony, or rosewood. The knife should be of sufficient sharpness to pierce the clasp.",

For those who engage with the world while remaining at home, no more than three sets are permitted. If one exceeds three, they must promptly be given away. To accumulate and then disperse transforms falsity into truth. True persons establishing teachings and cultivating themselves to lead others require two sets. Always keep them new and clean, and when they wear out, give them away. They may only be bestowed upon those who uphold the Dao; to give them to those who do not is to defile the true and upright—guard against this strictly. If no suitable recipient is found, purify them by fire according to the rites.\n\nThis principle applies not only to clothing but also to dwellings, mats, curtains, bedding, shoes, blankets, eating vessels, and written documents—whatever is fit to give, give away; what is unfit, purify.\n\n**Headscarves, Hats, and Garments:**\nRobes, skirts, undergarments, arm wraps, and other items—each should have two sets. One set is kept separately in another room and worn only during rituals, removed afterward. Store them in separate chests or baskets, keeping inner and outer garments apart. Ensure all are fragrant, clean, and well-ordered, with sizes, thickness, and materials (cloth or silk) chosen appropriately for the season. The wealthy must not be extravagant, nor the poor shabby; seek moderation and balance, following the master’s example. From the outset of receiving the teachings, one should prepare these items. If one is poor and cannot obtain everything at once, prioritize the essentials for the ordination hall, roughly as follows: a kudzu-fiber headscarf, a single-layer robe, a quilt, shoes, and a hand tablet. These five items must all be new and clean; do not use old or worn ones.\n\nWhen Lord Lao departed Zhou, and Zuo Ci lived in Wei, both wore kudzu-fiber headscarves and single-layer robes, never donning coarse cloth. Thus, from the Son of Heaven to the common people, all followed this practice. To \"wear coarse cloth while holding jade\" is a matter of individual capacity. For women, cinnamon skirts, yellow lower garments, and black shoes are appropriate; gold, jade, brocade, and embroidery are forbidden as adornments.\n\n**Tenth: The Method of Presenting Oneself and Submitting a Petition to the Master**\nFor all who receive the wondrous teachings, one must go to the master’s gate; one must not humble the esteemed or bend to visit a humble abode. If the master is a traveling Dharma teacher, one may extend an invitation as circumstances allow. When coming to study, one’s resolve must be firm; when going to teach, one’s burden is light. Those who attain the heart while forgetting boundaries are rare, so one must be deeply cautious.\n\nIf the fast lasts a full day, master and disciple must agree on the sequence of rituals, the method of offerings, and the items to be presented—enough to express one’s intent. Before the fast begins, one should have ample time to deliberate. If master or disciple faces an urgent matter, the duration of the fast may be shortened or extended—three periods or six periods, as one is able. On the evening of the initial gathering, present the petition according to the rites, writing and treating it with reverence, as detailed in the *Natural Rites*. The content of the petition may be expanded or condensed as needed, following the old text as a model. The ancient version is as follows:\n\nThis text was transmitted by the Four White-Haired Ones and differs from that recorded in the *Natural Secrets*. Master Le used this version, and it is fitting to compare it with the *Natural Secrets* to determine the proper balance.\n\n*\"The Three Caverns Dharma Master, [Master of Such-and-Such Peak], [Such-and-Such Ordination Master], [Daoist of Such-and-Such Qi and Such-and-Such Teaching], [So-and-So] of [Such-and-Such Record], a disciple of the Dao, male or female, a humble servant of [Such-and-Such Age], born in the year [Such-and-Such], on the [Such-and-Such] day of the [Such-and-Such] month at [Such-and-Such] hour, now residing in [Such-and-Such] Prefecture, [Such-and-Such] County, [Such-and-Such] Village, at [Such-and-Such] Palace, Mansion, Abode, Mountain, or Garrison—prostrating in reverence, I humbly submit this petition to seek the Dao, confessing my sins:*\n\n*By the causes of accumulated goodness, I have been blessed to encounter the profound transformation of the Three Treasures in this life, leaping with joy and delight. Though I am of lowly and foolish nature, I aspire to distant learning and higher studies. I have heard that the *Five Thousand Character Dao and Virtue Classic* is profound and far-reaching, and I humbly seek to receive it to fulfill my sincerest devotion. Respectfully following the Dharma treasure and the fast, I submit this petition, beseeching the Dharma Master to bestow completion upon me. Humbly submitted, I present myself at the gate of the Great High and Mysterious Dharma Master [Such-and-Such].\"*\n\n*\"In the year [Such-and-Such], the [Such-and-Such] month, [Such-and-Such] day, and [Such-and-Such] hour, at [Such-and-Such] Mountain in [Such-and-Such] Prefecture, [Such-and-Such] County, [Such-and-Such] Village, this petition is presented.\"*\n\n**Eleventh: The Method of Adjusting the Fast Ritual**\nThough the fast for receiving the Dao follows the *Natural Rites*, the preliminary announcements, the three offerings of incense, the invocations to the Ten Directions, and the Great Repentance Text should be expanded or condensed as circumstances require.\n\nIf the master has not yet received the registers, or if the ordination qi is incomplete, the fast does not conclude with the \"exit from office\" ritual, and no merit is declared. The form of declaring merit begins with an apology for inadequacy. It is also said that after the completion of past affairs, one returns to the body of the servant—this refers to the \"recovery of control,\" which occurs *after* the conclusion of the ritual. At the start of the fast, one must not immediately perform the \"recovery\" and \"exit from office.\" At the end, it is said: \"Merit Officers, Envoys, Flying Dragon Riders, and Scribes, having completed the presentation of affairs, each return to the servant’s body\"—this pertains to the transmission of the fast’s intent and concludes with their return, unrelated to the officials of the fast’s protective retinue.\n\nThe officials of the fast’s retinue attend until its completion, and only after all matters are concluded is merit declared and control recovered. If no \"exit from office\" is performed, one may simply recite the secret prayers, offer incense at the recovery brazier, and present petitions and vows; the rest of the rites remain the same.\n\n**Twelfth: The Method of Submitting a Memorial After the Fast**\nWhen transmitting the scriptures, one should do so after the fast’s allotted time, at dawn following the morning salutations and the completion of the circumambulation. One must not declare merit or recover the brazier prematurely. For a three-period fast, the morning rites are observed at dawn; for a six-period fast, the morning circumambulation is performed at dawn.",

      "translated_text": "At the commencement of the fast, when exiting office, one must not yet declare merit; if office is not exited, the brazier may not yet be recovered. The master then faces north, takes three pinches of incense, and upon completing the offering, returns to kneel in obeisance. After a brief seated pause, the five guarantors of the fast, still facing west, likewise sit briefly. The recipient of the scriptures approaches the master’s south side, facing north in prostration—women prostrate in the same manner as the master. The master sounds the drum thirty-six times and reads the memorial as follows:\n\nThis is the method for the hall. If exiting the altar to perform the rites, the master faces north, male disciples prostrate to the left facing east, and female disciples prostrate to the right facing west; they may not follow the same protocol as the master. If the altar is over a hundred paces from the hall, those who exited office during the fast declare merit and recover the brazier within the hall. Upon ascending the altar for a second exit from office, if the master has not overseen the canopy, he does not exit office; those who do not exit office enter the prayers, ignite the brazier, take incense, briefly sit facing north, sound the drum, and read the memorial.\n\nIf the altar is within a hundred paces, the morning salutations and circumambulation may be performed upon the altar. For rites conducted in the fast hall, the memorial is read facing north. On the day of altar dissolution, after the morning salutations and circumambulation are complete, one exits. If other matters remain unresolved or adjustments to public or private affairs are needed, one may wait until the midday salutations are concluded, then enter the hall or altar as fully prescribed, adhering to the procedures of the morning circumambulation. If wind or rain interrupts the morning rites, perform the salutations and circumambulation in the hall as prescribed; if the weather clears later in the day, ascend the altar in tranquility, enter the prayers, ignite the brazier, exit office, and submit the memorial. Unless it is a formal occasion, one need not perform the morning rites but may simply ignite the brazier, exit office, and proceed as outlined in the regulations. Only after the transmission of scriptures is complete does one recover office; those who did not exit office require no recovery.\n\nSince the fast’s commencement has already been announced, there is no need to exit office again. Once all matters are concluded, recover the brazier and depart. If ascending the altar at dawn before completing the morning salutations and circumambulation, and wind, rain, or calamity disrupts the rites, after the dismissal, maintain composure and proceed thus: perform the morning rites and circumambulation with dried provisions, then, upon completion, read the memorial.\n\n**Thirteenth: The Method of the Memorial’s Original Text**\n\nThe Three Caverns Master of [specific] Mountain, [Name], respectfully undertakes the *Scripture of Dao and Virtue in Five Thousand Characters*.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns are titled \"Cavern Spirit,\" the Numinous Treasure \"Cavern Mystery,\" and the Jade Clarity \"Cavern Truth.\" Those who receive these are called \"Three Caverns\"; those who have not received them are simply styled \"Master of the Supreme Dao and Virtue.\" After receiving the Dao, one becomes a master; upon ordaining a full number of disciples, the master submits a memorial reporting merits and virtues, thereby qualifying as a master. Only then may one be titled \"Dharma Master\"; those who have not done so may not serve as masters for others. If serving as the fast’s sponsor, one may only be called \"Disciple of the Three Treasures\" and may not be titled \"Dharma Master.\"\n\nIf one has received even a portion of the Three Caverns, one may state, \"Disciple undertakes the *Five Thousand Characters*.\" Without such reception, one may not presumptuously adopt the title. Upon receiving the Lord Lao and one, two, or all three caverns, one is titled \"Master of the Supreme Dao and Virtue\" and undertakes the affairs of the Three Caverns. Men refer to themselves as \"your servant,\" women as \"your handmaid.\"\n\nWomen at home have their reckoning periods, and upon marriage, distinctions arise between wives and concubines; yet in self-reference, all uniformly use \"handmaid.\" What is a handmaid? One who connects, swiftly attends, diligently serves superiors, fulfills commands, assists with alacrity, and does not linger, idle, or rest—lest she deviate from the true Dao. Unmarried women studying the Dao are called \"female students\"; those who have not received the registers are all called \"disciples.\" All use their father’s surname; married women use their husband’s surname. Those who leave their husbands revert to their original surname. Concubines may not honor their lords and thus do not adopt their lord’s surname. If a widow receives the Dao after her husband’s death, she may not sever ties with her husband and must retain his surname. If she remarries and later becomes principal, she may change her surname only after receiving the registers; if she has already received them, she must submit a memorial to the Great Dao before adopting a new surname. If granted a clan by a superior, she must likewise memorialize the Great Dao before using it. Previous documents need not be retroactively altered; the Three Officials, knowing the memorial has been submitted, will consult the source and issue decrees accordingly, sparing future documents the burden of redundant annotations or interlinear notes, thereby preserving the singularity of intent.\n\nWomen who receive the Dao and qualify as masters are titled similarly to men, with \"Dharma Master\" and \"Master.\" As for titles such as \"Primordial Sovereign,\" \"Lady,\" and others, each differs. The title \"Master\" signifies preeminent virtue, preceding others, enduring and imperishable—hence \"Master.\" One may not self-designate; like the Five Peaks, after years of cultivation, one’s virtue permeates the age, revered by both hidden and manifest realms. Only when masters and peers jointly memorialize to confer the title \"Master\" may one adopt it. If one’s birth year does not align with the governing peak, yet one’s spiritual attainments and teachings transform all directions, one need not adhere to peak-specific titles. The following twelve titles are the most exalted among all:\n\n*Transcendent Wanderer, Mystic Flourisher, Far-Ranging, Peak-Ranger, Vast Dao, Dao and Virtue, Perfected Communion, True Recluse, Supreme, Non-Action, Utmost, Orthodox Unity.*\n\nThese twelve titles are the highest among all appellations. Countless other titles, numbering in the tens of thousands, may be established according to merit and circumstances; they cannot all be enumerated here. Without the recommendation of masters and peers, one may not presumptuously adopt them.\n\nBow twice, prostrate, and rise to speak. After completing the obeisances, kneel lengthily and read the memorial’s opening address to the Supreme. After reading the petition, sit briefly, then rise and bow again.\n\nThe memorial begins:\n\nTo the Supreme, Boundless, Utmost Real, Unsurpassed, Non-Action Great Dao; the Lofty Sage, Mystic Numinous Nine Heavens Illuminated King; the Jade Emperor; the Thirty-Nine Perfected of the Upper Numinous; the Mystic Spirits of the Thirty-Two Heavens; the Eighty-One Lords; the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors; the Thirty-Six Earthly Sovereigns; the Myriad Immortal Dao Lords; the Inspecting Numinous Envoys; the Jade Lads Attending the Immortals; the Overseers of the Perfected; the Inspecting Saints; the Perfected Officials Attending the Scriptures; the Wondrous Lords of the Great Veil; the Responsive Perfected Essences; the Boundless Hosts of Great Saints who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions; and all the divine beings within and beyond the Three Realms:\n\nYour servant, by fortunate birth, has encountered this truth, received the scriptures and precepts, and day and night observes them, praising and propagating the wondrous transformation to deliver heaven and humanity. Though my talent is slight and my burden heavy, my trepidation runs deep. Relying on the Great Dao’s boundless compassion, I devote my heart and exhaust my strength, vowing to propagate it without slack. Given the circumstances, how dare I not submit this account? Now, with this memorial, my words are earnest, my aspirations fervent. Your servant, overwhelmed by the profundity of the Primordial, offers this with utmost reverence.",

When encountering worthy disciples, I transmitted them accordingly; when making dedications, I directed them toward the mysterious fulfillment of destiny. After receiving these teachings, I pledged in solemn covenant—swearing before the Nine Heavens—to uphold and cultivate them without fail.\n\nI have guarded my speech with vigilance, preserved the spirit by contemplating the true, diminished selfishness, and restrained desire, aspiring now to become a divine immortal. According to the ordained timeframe of the method—whether the six-by-four interval or the great reckoning of five and eight—should I encounter a worthy person, I shall, in accordance with the ritual statutes, submit a petition to the distant Nine Heavens. Only after verifying their sincerity and ensuring they are fully prepared in the Dharma may I transmit the teachings. I must not lightly disclose them or recklessly reveal them to the uninitiated.\n\nI hereby invoke the myriad spirits above and the Five Marchmounts below, along with the Three Rivers and Nine Springs, to bear witness as divine attestants. May this endeavor be accomplished and its merit fulfilled. Should I violate this covenant or betray its trust, may I and seven generations of my lineage together descend into perdition. The recipient of these scriptures, if named, shall be consigned to the ranks of the lowest ghosts, subjected to the scrutiny of attendant officials, made to tread the Mountain of Knives, dragged through the Forest of Swords, forced to consume fire and devour coals, embrace iron and plunge into boiling cauldrons, and traverse the Twenty-Four Hells for countless kalpas of suffering. I willingly accept these torments and dare not harbor resentment.\n\nIf, however, I cultivate in accordance with the Dharma and accumulate goodness, may the nine generations of my lineage ascend together. The recipient of these scriptures, if named, shall attain wisdom and enlightenment, prolong their lifespan, ascend as an immortal, and become a sage—a teacher of heaven and humanity. Their kin shall receive blessings, and all shall bear the grace of this transmission.\n\nWith this memorial, I humbly submit my account and await your response.\n\nYour servant, So-and-so, prostrates in awe and reverence, bows twice in submission, and respectfully presents this petition.
