  "full_translation": "**\"The Transmission of Dao by Heart**\n*Scripture Title:* **The Transmission of Dao by Heart**\n*Composed by:* Yuan Wang Weiyong. One scroll.\n*Source:* *The Orthodox Daoist Canon (Zhengtong Daozang)*, First Section.\n\n---\n\n**The Transmission of Dao by Heart**\n\nI, from my youth, ardently pursued the Dao and its methods, sparing neither labor nor hardship, seeking instruction from masters—how many were they? The world inquires about the **play of the Mystic Pass (Xuanguān)** and the **essence of the Dark Mother (Xuānmǔ)**.\n\nThey say: The Mystic Pass lies between the two kidneys, one *cùn* and three *fēn* below the navel. The Bright Hall (Mingtang) and the Six Harmonies (Liùhé), the Elixir Field (Dantian), the mouth and nostrils—these are the Dark Mother.\n\nThe world inquires about the **Five Phases’ generation and conquest**, the subtleties of **water and fire’s clashing and stripping**.\n\nThey say: The Five Phases—metal, wood, earth, water, fire—are arranged in a **crossed pattern within the well-diagram (jǐngzì)**, thus generating and conquering. **Silk talismans and brick seals** are cast into water, producing **judgmental sounds (píngyù)**, thus achieving clashing and stripping.\n\nI pondered these teachings and feared they did not yet reach the **Mystic Depths**. Thus, for over thirty years, I observed the gathering and scattering of clouds, the shifts in **qi and climate**, silently merging with their essence, my joy unknowable.\n\nBy fortune of past lives, I also encountered a **Sage of the Highest Order**, and in a single word, I attained certainty without doubt.\n\nFor the **movement and stillness of Heaven and Earth**, the **revolution of sun and moon**, the **order of the Four Seasons**, the **emergence of all things**—all arise from the **wondrous flow of the Supreme Ultimate (Tàijí)**. The Sage cannot describe it; they name it **Divine (Shén)**.\n\nThis Divine is neither green nor white, neither red nor black, neither fire nor water, neither square nor round. It spans the ancient and the present, dwelling within the human heart. When the heart is **pure and still**, it abides; when **filth and turbidity** arise, it vanishes.\n\nThus, when **essence (jīng)** is settled, **qi** is settled; when **qi** is settled, **spirit (shén)** is settled. When these three are settled, the **Dao and its methods are complete**.\n\nDispersed, it becomes **wind and clouds**; gathered, it manifests as **thunder and lightning**. It emerges as **generals and officers**; it returns as **the Golden Elixir (Jīndān)**.\n\nAlas, later scholars **wander in false paths**, lost in the **sea of desire**, severing their **original nature (běnzhēn)**, clinging to **written texts** as if they were treasures. This is **abandoning the True for the False**, seeking the ox while riding it.\n\nThus, **Master Sa** said:\n*A single spark of luminous spirit is the talisman—*\n*Yet fools mistake ink for cinnabar.*\n\n*When spirit does not scatter, Original Yang is steadfast,*\n*Ten thousand demons and monsters are swept away.*\n\n**Master Xu Jing** said:\n*If spirit departs, draw it back.*\n*When spirit returns to the body, qi flows naturally.*\n*Thus, morning and evening, returning again and again,*\n*The True Child is born from the womb of innocence.*\n\nHow much more so—**every person has their share**; all may attain this.\nWhy abandon oneself and willingly descend to the **Nine Abysses**?\nThis is truly lamentable.\n\nI have written this **Mind Transmission** to illuminate the later generations.\nIf the learned of former times were to glance at it, they would nod in approval.\n\n**On the Day of the First Full Moon, Year Jiawu of the Zhiyuan Era [1294],**\na humble student from Songjiang, **Jingyang Wang Weiyu**, recorded this in haste.\n\n---\n\n**Mind Transmission of the Dao**\n**Primordial Ancestral Qi**\nEars, eyes, mouth, nose, body—\nSpirit, soul, and intent.\nPiercing the Central Palace, they transmute into **Primordial Qi**.\n\n**Original Spirit**\nMy Original Spirit before the Void—\nA formless, shapeless, nameless self.\nPiercing gold, traversing stone without obstruction,\nA single luminous spark illuminating all.\n\n**Divine Powers**\nEach person holds their own **Heaven and Earth**,\nWithin which stands a **Sovereign Most High**.\nCommanding all spirits across the Three Realms,\nYet fools waste their vital essence in vain.\n\n**Mystic Applications**\nAscending to Heaven or descending to Earth—\nFire cannot burn, water cannot drown.\nFilling the boundless void, encompassing all forms,\nYet unseen when gazed upon, unheard when listened to.\n\n**Mysterious Womb**\nA hollow orifice—root of Heaven and Earth,\nEndlessly dense, yet no wind passes through.\nVague and distant, yet containing form,\nWhen the True Person emerges, a **Precious Pearl** is born.\n\n**True Earth**\n**Yin and Yang** unite as the **Yellow Mother**,\nHeaven and Earth have no recourse.\nDay and night they cling together,\nYet remain unaware of their own grinding.\n\n**True Seed**\nThe **Primordial One**—called **True Lead**—\nPlanted in **Kun** when born in **Qian**.\nNurtured for three years until ripe,\nThen wandering the **Penglai Isles** as an immortal.\n\n**True Furnace and Cauldron**\nThe **True Furnace and Cauldron** forge the elixir—\nWhy seek them externally in trifles?\nWhen the mind is still, the body steadies itself,\nAnd when body and mind are still, the **Elixir Seed** appears.\n\n**True Medicinals**\nThe **Three Supreme Medicines** are no ordinary substances,\nBorn when **Heaven and Earth** have not yet divided.\nWhen the fire is sufficient, the elixir ripens—\nA serpent swallows one grain and becomes a dragon.\n\n**Dragon and Tiger (Metaphorical Names)**\nIf the mind is not concentrated, it cannot be subdued,\nLike the might of dragons and tigers.\nYet if one knows the place of **No-Mind and No-Thought**,\nEver guarding the Original Spirit in the **Chamber of Mystery**.\n\n**Lead and Mercury (Spiritual Essences)**\nThe two essences—**Spirit and Qi**—are **Lead and Mercury**,\nYet using them unseen, they are useless when seen.\nTransfer the **real essence of Kan** to the **void of Li**,\nAnd the Spirit moves within, leaving no gaps.\n\n**The One Yang Begins**\nThe work begins with **One Yang**,\nWhen **One Yang** first stirs, merging with **Primordial Unity**.\nPrimordial Qi is thus obtained,\nAnd refining it yields the **Golden Elixir**, the **Pharmaceutical Sovereign**.\n\n**The Dao Is Near**\nThe Dao is not distant—it lies within the mind.\nNo need to seek it across mountains and rivers.\nTo attain the Dao, the heart must first be rectified,\nAnd **Pure Yang** must not be tainted by even a trace of **Yin**.\n\n**Post-Heavenly Formation**\nWhen **Yin and Yang** unite, the embryo forms,\nFor ten months, **Primordial Unity** remains sealed.\nLaughable are the foolish who forget their origin,\nNot recalling their source from days of old.\n\n**The Two Are One**\n**Primordial** gives birth, **Post-Heavenly** sustains—\nThe **Six Bandits** assail day and night, plunging into darkness.\nYet knowing they are one without distinction,\nNurture them to soar through the **Heavenly Gate** on a crane.\n\n**The Body’s Priceless Treasure**\nWithin the body lies a priceless treasure—\n**Essence, Qi, and Original Spirit**.\nPreserve and nurture them with unwavering awareness,\nAnd without leakage, one becomes a **True Person**.\n\n**The Secret of Longevity**\n**Nature** returns to **Command**—one may become immortal,\nBut if **Spirit departs**, the body dies—how pitiful.\nTo make this body never die,\nCultivate it in the **Undivided Chaos** before differentiation.\n\n**Nature and Life Are One**\nLife is Nature, Nature is Life—\nThey must never be separated.\nBefore **joy, anger, sorrow, or delight** arise,\nWalk the path of **Central Harmony**, the **Heavenly Position**.\n\n**The Dead Heart, the Living Spirit**\nWhen not a single thought arises, that is the **True Heart**,\nBut as soon as deliberation begins, it becomes the **Deluded Heart**.\nOnly when the heart is still does the Spirit truly live,\nAnd in unbounded freedom, even ghosts and gods revere.\n\n**The Void is Within Me**\nAll things are empty, yet **Nature** is not empty—\nThoughts lurk hidden in the **Great Void**.\nComing and going without constraint,\nI let the sun and moon rise and set as they will.\n\n**The Stem of *Hai* Wood**\n**Xun Wood** planted in *Hai* in autumn—\nIts vitality transforms endlessly.\nTo know where **Shedding returns to the Root**,\nLook to where **Heaven and Earth** have not yet divided.\n\n**Child of *Zi* and *Hai***\nWhen **Li** and **Kan** intersect, the **Sacred Embryo** forms,\nAnd when **Zi** meets **Hai**, the child is born.\nThe child entrusts itself to the **Yellow Mother** for nurturing,\nAnd when perfected, the Spirit ascends to the **Nine Heavens**.\n\n**Man’s Misuse of the Heart**\nRotten grass becomes fireflies, worms turn into dragons,\nAnd cicadas transform to drink the **Pure Wind**.\nThough divine powers are vast, only humans gather them—\nYet alas, deluded ones misuse their efforts.\n**They forget the root, chasing after the branches.**\n\n「The Essence of Parents’ Vitality»\nThe vital essence of parents combines to form a man—\nYet they never truly saw his original face.\nChasing fame and profit wears away his substance,\nAnd after death, he willingly endures bitter suffering.\n\n**Love and Desire Bind the Mind**\nLove and desire ensnare all—\nNo one escapes becoming a transcendent.\nLove and desire bind, yet none advance.\nWhen the final hour arrives, you depart alone—\nAll reduced to a dream sinking into the Yellow Springs.\n\n**The Cycle of Gratitude and Harm**\nGratitude and harm intertwine:\nFrom gratitude springs harm, from harm arises gratitude,\nAnd this endless loop opens the gate of life and death.\nOnly when matters reach their extreme do regrets begin—\nBetter to return to the Root and reclaim your true nature.\n\n**Distress and Delusion»\nDistress and delusion stem from greed and ignorance,\nAnd once thoughts arise, fear delays their cessation.\nFollow nature’s flow, resist what comes against it—\nThen the heart naturally purifies itself.\nWickedness will never dare to linger near.\n\n**The Shackles of Body and Mind»\nHauling firewood, carrying water—\nThe years pass in endless toil,\nBinding body and mind, leaving no freedom.\nOnly the enlightened understand this truth:\nWith a flower in their hair and wine in hand, they drift effortlessly.\n\n**Form is Emptiness»\nForm is emptiness—yet few recognize it,\nAnd adorn their hollow skulls with endless artifice.\nAlways keep the Dao-eye open, as if nothing exists—\nDo not waste your bright pearls in dark investments.\n\n**Distress Diminishes the Spirit»\nI urge you to rejoice and not indulge in distress—\nFor distress surely weakens the Spirit.\nBlend with the world, harmonize with its light,\nAnd live each moment with contentment’s four seasons.\n\n**All Matters Are Fleeting»\nWorldly affairs swirl like tangled hemp,\nYet when counted, they amount to nothing.\nBetter to withdraw early and seek true refuge—\nRecognize Penglai as your eternal home.\n\n**Self-Fulfillment and Joy»\nBlow the wind through a reed flute without holes,\nAnd summon the green cranes and white herons to play.\nDrink freely, let the wine linger in your cup—\nThen depart to visit the cave-dwellers of Xi Yi.\n\n**The Game of Life and Death»\nThe river of love flows boundless and wide,\nThe sea of desire runs deep without end.\nHow many souls drown within its depths,\nEndlessly losing the game of life and death?\n\n**Awakening and Early Practice»\nA plow-ox, dragged and driven without shame,\nIs lashed and whipped until it knows no fear.\nThen one day it suddenly returns to the slaughterhouse—\nRegretting it had not practiced early and awakened.\n\n**The Body as Greatest Affliction»\n\n**The True Nature of Life and Death**\nThe birth-and-death cycle is but one true thing,\nIts root arises from illusion’s stir—thus the self comes to be.\nIf great afflictions breed all suffering,\nReturn to the origin, restore the primal—free yourself from worldly dust.\n\n**The Six Demons of Disturbance**\nSix demons dwell within the body, tormenting mortals,\nYet none seize the moment to cultivate virtue’s harmony.\nDay by day they fade, leaving no trace—\nOnly the radiant gold-light reveals their true nature.\n\n**The Difficulty of Being Human**\nTo ponder quietly in this world is hard,\nEnduring myriad trials of mortal life.\nWhen you reach the end of water and mountain,\nOnly then does the body find true peace.\n\n**Gold from the Ore**\nHuman hearts must align with Heaven’s will,\nTurning iron rods to needles through deep practice.\nWait until the fire of refinement burns away—\nThen the ore is exhausted, and true gold remains.\n\n**Act When the Mind Strayeth**\nMind-monkeys and will-horses race in tandem,\nThrough the twelve hours—do not act in folly.\nThe moment a thought strays, strike it down,\nEven if you sink into deep confusion.\n\n**Doubt in All Matters**\nZhang Hu saw a pig wallowing in mud,\nA cartload of ghosts causing chaos and strife.\nThe world holds nothing inherently strange—\nWhy create doubt where none should arise?\n\n**The Body Is Not Eternal**\nThe four elements are borrowed, not truly yours,\nTemporarily lodged in this dusty realm, not permanent.\nJoy or sorrow, grief or delight—\nDo not wait until death to play the fool.\n\n**The Art of True Abiding**\nMaster the somersault on the high pole,\nDig to find Heaven—it is the same as Earth.\nAll things fall silent in the true realm’s mystery,\nWhile mortals still debate life and death in vain.\n\n**Clay Spirits and Dragon-Capturing**\nClay spirits sink into water, losing their radiance,\nDragons are seized and led to the Jade Capital.\nNo single punch is struck to shatter them—\nThe moon rises over the sea, tides turn calm.\n\n**The Iron Ox Cultivates the Golden Lotus**\nAn iron ox plows the earth, sowing golden lotuses,\nRequiring no labor or coin.\nHeaven’s River waters nourish them,\nFlowers bloom, their fragrance filling the sky.\n\n**The Puppet of Thread**\nHuman life is a puppet pulled by a thread,\nDragged forward without daring to retreat.\nWhen the thread snaps, it cannot rise again—\nWhat use are grandchildren to a lifeless eye?\n\n**Money as Master**\nMen toil endlessly for wealth’s sake,\nLosing time in sorrow, rejoicing in gain.\nMasked as ghosts or men, they play their roles—\nLook closely, and you see only yourself.\n\n**Learning Knows No Order**\nHidden truths are hard to fathom—do not deceive yourself,\nFor learning has no strict order, only high and low.\nBefore probing the depths of mystery,\nDo not presume to judge before others.\n\n**Discerning the Wise and Foolish**\nWe transmit the heart’s truth in learning,\nIgnoring Heaven’s secrets through blunt speech.\nOnly the virtuous understand in silence,\nRecognizing wisdom through mutual resonance.\n\n**No Need for External Seeking**\nThough you bow to a hundred masters,\nEach may boast of grand pretensions.\nAsk east, and they point west—\nHarmony is lost, like discordant strings.\n\n**Striving with Resolute Will**\nFervently practicing the Thunder Method,\nNo place in the world can satisfy its demands.\nThirty years of effort—\nOnly then does the heart find peace.\n\n**What Is Practice?**\nFirst, uphold precepts as the root,\nThen guard Heaven’s laws—do not act in folly.\nTo summon the Thunder God to submission,\nIts crashes and flashes must split the heart open.\n\n**Practice Comes First**\nTo become an immortal through methods,\nPractice must precede all else.\nSave the people, ease their suffering,\nAnd ascend to Heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**Speak and Act in Truth**\nSpeak truly, and it shall be done—\nNo need for further exhortation.\nIf this life is squandered,\nYou shall sink into endless confusion for eons.\n\n**Unity of Essence and Function**\nDao is the essence of the method,\nThe method is the function of Dao.\nWhen essence and function align,\nThe Three Realms merge into one.\n\n**Orthodoxy Conquers Heresy**\nThe Ancestors established law within the heart,\nAnd only when the heart’s law is mastered\nAre all laws understood.\nWith orthodoxy, heresy is subdued—\nThen even flowers and moon fear Liang Gong.\n\n**The Law’s Miraculous Power**\nHow does the law manifest its power?\nIt does not leave the black essence within the body.\nWhen qi and spirit gather, the spirit abides,\nAnd myriad demons dissolve into dust.\n\n**Exhausting Principle to Know Fate**\nExhausting principle and nature reveals destiny,\nIgnorance of truth is the greatest ailment.\nWhen crows fly, fish leap, and cranes cry in the mist,\nMastery of transcendence leads to sainthood.\n\n**Harmonizing Yin and Yang**\nObserve Heaven’s way and follow its movements,\nOnly then does Yin and Yang truly unite.\nToday, I reveal this to you—\nDo not treat these words as commonplace.\n\n**Man Is Inferior to Things**\nHumans are the most enlightened of creatures,\nYet things often surpass them.\nObserve the serpent coiled around stone,\nHiding until spring’s return.\n\n**Hiding with the Thunder**\nTo practice the Thunder Method,\nAlways follow the thunder’s concealment.\nPerfecting true transformation,\nOnly then may you act and spread its power.\n\n**Seals and Talismans**\nTalismans, seals, and incantations are but written tools,\nTheir power lies in cultivation and focused thought.\nSilent stillness reveals Heaven’s heart,\nAnd every response aligns with subtle truth.\n\n**Sacrificing to Summon Evil**\nSlaughtering life to harm others while invoking the Thunder General\nOnly invites malevolent spirits to appear.\nThe virtuous and upright do otherwise—\nWith sincerity, all things communicate with Heaven.\n\n**The Talisman’s True Power**\nInk and vermilion cannot make a talisman sacred,\nIts power lies in the original spirit-qi.\nWhen transformation and movement are known,\nThe marrow-palace heals, and peace is restored.\n\n**Lift and It Is Done**\nNurture the spirit, and it becomes divine—\nNo need to close your eyes to store the mind.\nEvery thought and impulse flows within—\nA single spark of light never leaves the body.\n\n**The Ebb and Flow of Yin and Yang**\nAlways watch the Dipper’s handle in the sky,\nAs Yin wanes and Yang grows, passing in turn.\nThey form the four seasons, eight nodes,\nGiving birth to medicines too wondrous to proclaim.\n\n**Peeling and Returning**\nCreation enfolds the Great Ultimate,\nFrom peeling and returning, divine craft unfolds.\nWhen six Yangs are complete, they return to Kun,\nStirring thunder and lightning from the Kan Dragon.\n\n**Thunder’s Origin**\nWhen Heaven’s Yang grows bright and days lengthen,\nThe gentle wind stirs warmth, and the northern tide rises.\nOne Yang reaches Zheng—thunder emerges,\nThunder in Kun becomes its voice.\n\n**Thunder’s Fury**\nWood meets fire’s vigor, heat then arises,\nThe turbulent southern wind disrupts the Five Phases.\nStirring thunder’s crash brings transformation,\nCold follows, obscuring clarity.\n\n**What Is Thunder?**\nYang-one is thunder, Yin-two is lightning,\nYin and Yang’s qi fluctuates in excess or lack.\nWhen Yin contains Yang to its extreme, it must release,\nStirring the sky-shaking, earth-rattling sound.\n\n「To discern the Thunder’s Aperture\nWind and cloud, thunder and rain are all concealed within One *Qi*.\nThis aperture is known to few—most fail to recognize its truth.\nStirring and peeling disrupt the Heavenly Dragon’s array,\nHalting wind and rain with a crashing, earth-shaking roar.\n\n**What Is Wind?**\nWhen Heaven’s *Qi* shifts and transforms, it becomes wind,\nWhich must divide into south and north, east and west.\nIt can bring forth life or take it away, summon rain or clear the sky,\nAnd at the moment of prayer, its power is manifest.\n\n**What Are Clouds and Rain?**\nWhen Earth’s *Qi* ascends and gathers, it forms clouds.\nDispersed as *Qi*, they coalesce into rain.\nRain emerges from mountains and rivers within,\nRise and observe—then you’ll know what to expect.\n**What Is Thunder?**\nWhen ripe fruits split open, their essence is revealed—\nThese principles must be thoroughly explored.\nWhen *Qi* is pent and steams the earth, dampness arises,\nStirring and peeling disrupt the balance of Yin and Yang.\n\n**What Is Rain?**\nDryness becomes wind, dampness turns to rain,\nIts transformations never stray from Earth.\nBut watch the steam from cooked rice—\nWhen fire arrives, its nature is revealed.\n\n**What Is Lightning?**\nWhen Yin ascends and Yang descends without passage,\nWater and fire churn, producing lightning’s flash.\nA golden radiance emerges, responding to divine intent,\nFollowed by thunder’s roar as *Qi* is discharged.\n\n**The River’s Omen**\nTo pray for rain or clear skies, one must know the River’s *Qi* and its season,\nFor its signs reveal the patterns of Heaven.\nWhen the Five Directions clash, wind and cloud converge,\nAnd the Thunder God is summoned to move at will.\n\n**Understanding Wind and Cloud**\nMountain winds stir *Qi*, summoning clouds and rain,\nHeaven’s Gate opens—wind is born.\nIf you grasp these pivotal moments,\nThunder and rain will fill the void.\n\n**The Power of One *Qi***\nOne *Qi* shifts and returns—\nLater, the dominance of Yin and Yang is seen.\nBringing back one transformation to peace,\nThis truth is shared with none but the wise.\n\n**Uneven Clarity and Turbidity**\nOne *Qi* cycles through turbidity and clarity,\nRising pure, descending foul—balance is essential.\nWhen Yin is excessive and Yang is weak, misty rain forms,\nWhen Yang is strong and Yin is wan, prolonged clear skies reign.\n\n**The Generations and Restrictions of the Five Phases**\nOne, two, three, four, five—\nEarth holds the center.\nKnowing the moments of generation and restriction,\nYou command thunder and rain with a single word.\n\n**Brightness and Darkness in Contrast**\nBrightness gives rise to darkness, darkness to brightness,\nTheir division clear—when rain ceases, skies brighten.\nRooted in Yin and Yang from the Great Ultimate,\nExamine their subtleties, near and far.\n\n**Balancing Water and Fire**\nFire gathers at noon’s peak,\nWater forms at the moon’s rise.\nWater and fire must be balanced,\nFor imbalance breeds chaos.\n\n**The Fluctuations of Yin and Yang**\n*Qi* shifts through the Heavenly Cycle, waxing and waning,\nLike the Yellow Bell’s seasonal rhythm, precise and unerring.\nDo not let Yin and Yang become disordered—\nFrost in June, thunder in October will follow.\n\n**The Moon’s Influence on Rain and Clear Skies**\nWhen the moon emerges at *Gēng* (庚), its side is even,\nThe first half of its cycle brings rain, the latter clear skies.\nTo know the mysteries of creation’s workings,\nListen to the magpie’s cry and the crow’s call—signs of coming weather.\n\n**The Sun’s Changes in *Qi***\nThe sun shifts from cold to hot, hot to cold,\nSouth wind turns to north—observe its flow.\nWho comprehends the reversals of Yin and Yang?\nTo know them is to never be deceived.\n\n**The Five Peaks Communicating with Heaven**\nIn Heaven they take form as symbols, on Earth as peaks,\nOne *Qi* cycles endlessly without pause.\nThe Five Peaks conceal the divine, mastering creation,\nWhen *Jiǎ* (甲) and *Gēng* (庚) meet, thunder and *Qi* surge.\n\n**The Four Seas’ Apertures**\nThe Four Seas have apertures piercing to the heavens,\nHeaven responds to stars, Earth to tides.\nOne breath, one inhalation—this is the subtle principle,\nThe *Lián* (屯) and *Méng* (蒙) hexagrams unite at dawn and dusk.\n\n**Contemplating Celestial Patterns**\nObserve Heaven without speaking of the Four Seasons’ march,\nThe *Qi* shifts, the myriad transformations busily unfold.\nFortune and calamity are revealed in signs,\nYet who among mortals truly seeks to understand?\n\n**Examining Earthly Geography**\nHeaven’s One *Qi* gives rise to Earth’s Two,\nWildflowers and grasses mirror the stars’ influence.\nMountains, rivers, seas, and peaks conceal their brilliance,\nWithin the vigorous *Qi*, each holds its form.\n\n**Creation’s Cyclical Flow**\nFive days form a *hòu* (候), two *Qi* form a cycle,\nThree cycles make a node—each has its meaning.\nYin and Yang distribute across the Heavenly Cycle,\nChewing these truths reveals their depth.\n\n**Subtle Principles Beyond Speech**\nWhen the sun reaches *Qián* (乾), it’s still before *Shēn* (申),\nAt night, turning from *Kǎn* (坎) to emerge as *Yín* (寅).\nDoes water fear fire, does fire fear water?\nThe Dragon rises with the *Qi*—its power is divine.\n\n**The Dynamics of Heaven and Earth**\nExtreme motion yields stillness, stillness breeds motion,\nBetween them lies the wondrous interplay.\nThere are clear skies, rain, wind, and cloud,\nThe Dipper’s handle at the Heavenly Heart governs all.\n\n**Predicting Rain and Clear Skies**\nYin and Yang move in their own time,\nTheir opposition never ceases.\nIf you know when rain and clear skies will come,\nPrayers to the divine will surely be answered.\n\n**Stirring and Peeling Yin and Yang**\nWind, cloud, thunder, and rain all originate from this,\nThe stirring and peeling of Yin and Yang—truly awe-inspiring.\nDo not waste effort on mere parchment study,\nOnly by probing the *Qi* of Heaven will you find its taste.\n\n**Regulating Drought and Flood**\nWhen *Qi* and climate align, drought and flood are absent,\nYet imbalance spawns chaos.\nThe Dipper’s handle shifts, the Heavenly Gate turns—\nAdjusting Yin and Yang, the Great Way prevails.\n\n**Thunder Rising from Earth**\nHeaven and Earth are daily sovereigns,\nYet thunder originates from Earth.\nWhen *Qi* is pent and steams, it bursts forth,\nRolling wind and cloud, summoning rain.\n\n**The Dragon Hidden in Pools and Caves**\nThe Dragon dwells in pools and caves,\nWhen *Qi* is pent, it leaps to life.\nWhen the Dragon’s time is at hand,\nWho dares underestimate its might?\n\n**Mist Transforming into Clouds**\nMist *Qi* arises at dawn, not in season,\nUnbroken rain follows without doubt.\nEndless clouds may appear, yet no rain—\nIf the time is not right, there’s no fixed rule.\n\n**Fire’s Omen for Clear Skies**\nWhen wind stirs the high heavens and the Four *Qi* are clear,\nFire clouds form—clear skies will follow.\nAs the sun traverses the land without fail,\nOnly when Yin’s time arrives will rain form.\n\n**Observing the Wind’s Movements**\nWinds shift in countless ways,\nRain turns to clear skies, heat to cold.\nYin and Yang’s waxing and waning establish the order,\nHeaven’s Gate does not permit casual observation.\n\n**Thunder’s Retreat**\nWhen the Dipper’s handle completes its cycle and points west,\nMetal’s *Qi* grows potent, the knife’s edge sharp.\nAs Yang wanes and Yin ascends, the peeling must occur,\nThunder retreats, its voice muffled in time.\n\n**Praying for Snow with the Mud Ox**\nTo seek auspicious snow, use the Mud Ox’s form,\nFirst wind, then rain—observe its cause.\nUnderstand that thunder’s rise is a shifting of the *Qi*,\nSixfold blessings appear when the time is right.\n\n**Foretelling Clouds**\nAt night, watch the Dragon play with its pearl,\nBy day, observe the clouds’ convergence.\nPrayers answered in season prove divine,\nFor Heaven’s secrets are fully revealed.\n\n**Bowing to the Mysterious Aperture**\nAll laws stem from One Aperture,\nYet none in the world know its truth.»\n\n**Breaking the Mystery of the One Aperture**\n\nI wish to speak plainly, yet fear you may still doubt.\n**Bow to the Primordial *Qi* of the Pre-Heaven**\nIf you ask about the Pre-Heaven’s single *Qi* and find nothing,\nThen the Post-Heaven’s work begins.\n\nAt midnight, if you sit with a clear mind,\nThis *Qi* will be known to emerge from **Great Emptiness (Tàixū)**.\nWhen **Yin** wanes and **Yang** thrives, drought follows,\nYet when **Yin** and **Yang** harmonize, abundance is sure.\nWhen **Yang** wanes and **Yin** thrives, floods arise,\nAnd when **Yin** and **Yang** clash, eclipses occur.\n\nThe **Five Thunders** are born of **Yin** and **Yang** *Qi*,\nShaped by the **Five Phases (Wǔxíng)**.\n**Yin** *Qi* descends and ascends in rhythm,\nResponding to the Dipper’s handle’s turning.\n\nThere is growth and decline, retreat and concealment.\nFrom **Winter Solstice (Dōngzhì)**, the **One Yang** emerges in the **Returning (Kàn) Hexagram**,\nThe **Two Yang** in the **Approaching (Lín) Hexagram**,\nThe **Three Yang** in the **Calm (Tài) Hexagram**,\nThe **Four Yang** in the **Great Strength (Dàzhuàng) Hexagram**.\n\nAt this time, *Qi* aligns with **Spring Equinox (Chūnfēn)**,\nThe **Perverse (Xùn) Wind** stirs, the earth’s moisture rises.\nBefore the **first lunar crescent (qiánxián)**, thunder begins to sound.\n\nThe **Five Yang** in the **Decaying (Guì) Hexagram**,\nThe **Six Yang** complete in the **Receptive (Kàn) Hexagram**—\n**Divine *Qi*** must unite,\nWaiting for the **Shaking (Zhèn)** to issue commands.\nWithout **Water** and **Fire** clashing and stripping,\nIt cannot manifest—thus, when **Yang** reaches its peak, **Yin** arises.\n\nFrom **Summer Solstice (Xiàzhì)**, the **One Yin** in the **Conception (Chèn) Hexagram**,\nThe **Two Yin** in the **Withdrawing (Dùn) Hexagram**,\nThe **Three Yin** in the **Obstructing (Pǐ) Hexagram**,\nThe **Four Yin** in the **Meeting (Gòu) Hexagram**.\n\nAt this time, *Qi* aligns with **Autumn Equinox (Qiūfēn)**,\nThe **Metal Wind** clears and stills, all trees scatter.\nBefore the **first lunar crescent (hòuxián)**, thunder retreats its voice.\n\nThe **Five Yin** in the **Shedding (Bō) Hexagram**,\nThe **Six Yin** complete in the **Earth (Kūn) Hexagram**—\n**Returning to the roots**, **reclaiming life**,\n**Preserving *Qi***, **nurturing spirit**.\nWhen **Yin** reaches its peak, **Yang** arises,\nAnd the cycle begins anew—\nThe **Dao/Way** of eternal transformation, never ceasing.\n\nThose who **summon thunder** must penetrate **Yin** and **Yang**,\nDeepen their grasp of **creation’s workings (Zàohuà)**,\nClarify the **Heaven-Earth’s shifting rhythms (Tīngdìngzhījī)**,\nDiscern the **changes in wind-thunder *Qi***,\nAnd know what **wind, thunder, and rain** truly are—\nFrom what they arise, why they stir,\nWhere they begin, how they correspond to months, days, and hours,\nWhich thunder they agitate—\nThen they wield the fury of **howling gales, sudden rains, crashing thunderbolts, and deafening peals**.\n\nYet **stirring must follow stillness**, and **stillness must precede stirring**—\nWho orchestrates this **logic of rise and fall**?\n\nI recall **Master Yīchuān (Zhú Xī)** asking **Master Shào Yàofū**:\n*\"Where will the thunder-wind arise this year?\"*\nThis single question encapsulates the **wondrous workings of creation**—\nWorthy of careful reflection and deep contemplation.\n\nIf you grasp this **one aperture’s passage**, all apertures are clear,\nIf one **divine essence (shén)** moves, all **divine essences** respond.\nThe **southeast (Xùn)** direction is not where thunder is summoned—\nUsing it would merely waste your **spiritual vitality**.\n\nYet this **one aperture**—\nFormless, shapeless,\nNeither before nor after,\nNeither long nor short,\nBeyond measure of width or narrowness,\nBeyond distinction of east, west, south, or north—\nResides precisely at the **Heaven-Earth’s intersection**,\nWhere **Yin** and **Yang** blend in unity.\nEven **ghosts and gods** cannot fathom its mysteries.\n\nAlas, **later learners** fail to grasp this truth,\nInstead fixating on the **rotten corpse’s fleshly orifices**,\nFocusing on the **elixir field (Dāntián)**,\nOr obsessing between the **two kidneys**.\nSome channel *Qi* beneath the **navel (qíxià)**,\nOthers gaze at the **muddy pellet (Níhuán)**,\nLost in **frantic speculation**—\nBelieving this to be **enlightenment**.\n\nTo speak of **one aperture** is how distant you are!\nThus it was said before:\n*\"Wind and clouds, thunder and rain hide in the One,\nYet most fail to recognize this aperture’s law.\nThe Dragon’s ranks scatter with stripping and clashing,\nMetal winds and Metal rains crash in thunderbolts.\nIf one can observe Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,\nAnd grasp Heaven’s **actions (xíng)**,\nThen self-knowledge is attained.\"*\n\nWhen **Yin** and **Yang** are misaligned,\nAnd *Qi*’s rhythms disrupt their order—\nEither **Yang** overpowers **Yin**, bringing scorching drought,\nOr **Yin** overpowers **Yang**, causing floods to rise—\nThe key lies in **summoning thunder**:\nBalancing **Yin** and **Yang** to flow smoothly,\nDirecting **creation’s transformations (Zàohuà)** to circulate freely.\nTurning the Dipper’s handle,\nCalling thunder and rain to save the **parched and withered**;\nReversing the **Heavenly Aperture (Tiānguān)**,\nRousing **wind and thunder** to sweep away **Yin’s obscurations**.\n\nYet today’s scholars are scattered,\nMost lacking **true teachers** to guide them.\nThey rely on **rumors and hearsay (dàotīngtúshuō)**,\nStealing scraps of **law and method (lòufǎ)**.\nThey do not seek the **ultimate treasure within their hearts**,\nBut only chase the **mysterious script on paper**.\n\nDiscussing **mysteries**, boasting of **wonders**,\nPraising themselves while belittling others.\nTheir words are **pure**, yet their deeds are **filthy**,\nIgnoring **Heaven’s decrees**—\nThus **Three Officials** strike their **tablets**,\n**Five Emperors** list their **grievances**,\nAnd after their **bodies perish**, their **souls fall into Yīndū**,\nSuffering endless torments.\nAh! How difficult it is to **practice the law**—\nShould one not fear it? Should one not fear it?\n\n**Later learners**, take heed and strive anew.\n\nOn the **First Day of the First Month of Jiǎwǔ in Zhìyuán (至元甲午上元日)**,\nA **later learner from Sōngjiāng (松江)**, **Thunder’s Scattering Official (Léitíng Sǎnlì)**, **Jǐngyáng Wěiyīn (景阳王惟一)**, recorded this.\n\nI, a humble fool,\nDabbled in **Daoist methods**,\nOnce encountered a **true master** who taught me,\nAnd I came to know a few of the **law’s secrets**.\nI reflected on the **ancestral teachers’ words**:\n*\"The law moves through Pre-Heaven’s single *Qi*,\nAnd must be wielded by your own **original spirit (yuánshén)**.\"*\nThis is a **direct pointing to the profound**, enlightening **later learners**.\n\nYet scholars with shallow insight,\nUnable to awaken to its truth,\nInstead fixate on **visualizing and imagining**—\nTaking it as **mystery**.\n\nLittle did they know—\n**Forsaking the root for the branch**,\n**Abandoning truth for illusion**!\n\nI too once failed to grasp this principle,\nAnd sought only the **written teachings of enlightened masters**.\nSome would **chant the \"sob\" (tí) sound**,\nSwallowing it into the **elixir field (Dāntián)**,\nThen **draw forth the \"mocking\" (cháo) sound**,\nImagining **golden light**—\nThis was their way of **Pre-Heaven’s single *Qi***.\n\nOthers would **harbor the spirit of Fire**,\n**Store the essence of Water**,\nAnd **intercourse at the Primordial Sea (Yuánhǎi)**,\nForming a **baby**, believing it their **original spirit**.\n\nI did not follow such paths,\nBut through **painstaking effort**,\nFortunately met a **true teacher**,\nWho revealed the **one aperture of thunder**,\nExplaining these **principles**—\nAwakening me from my **drunken haze**, dispelling all previous errors.\n\nLater, I received **Master Yuèdǐng Mò’s** **messenger’s method**,\nAnd he expounded on the **Pre-Heaven’s mysteries**.\nHe said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** speaks of the space between Heaven and Earth—\nLike a **bagpipe’s bellows (tuóqiào)**—\nEmpty yet never collapsing,\nStirred yet ever more abundant.\"*\n\n「Just these *principles* are the pivotal mechanisms of **cosmic transformation (Zàohuà)**.\nThe *bellows* (Chōng) are like my belly,\nThe *mouth-nostril* (Tuó) are like my mouth and nose.\n*\"Empty yet never collapsing\"* refers to the **Pre-Heaven’s Primordial *Qi*** (Yuánqì)—\nThe **Primordial Essence** of the Central Yellow.\n\nThe **Buddhist School** calls it the **Jewel of Wisdom, Precious Lamp of *Dharma*** (Huìrì Bǎodēng Mónízhū),\nThe **Confucian School** names it **Heavenly-Spontaneous *Qi*** (Hàorán zhī qì),\nThe **Chan School** labels it the **Place of Settling the Body and Establishing Life** (Ānshēn lìmìng chù),\nAnd **Daoist Alchemists** term it **Golden Elixir** (Jīndān)—\nYet they are all one in essence.\n\nIt is also called the **Divine Chamber of Elixir**,\nThe **Root of Heaven and Earth**,\nThe **Source of All *Qi***,\nThe **Girdle of the Great Ultimate (Tàijí)**.\n\nIts vast and boundless nature,\nIts hazy and indistinct presence—\nWithout inner or outer,\nWithout attachment or foundation,\nNor even four directions—\n*\"Stirred yet never collapsing\"* means:\nWhen the *bellows* (tuó) are abandoned, the *mouth-nostril* (qiào) naturally emits a sound.\n\nI, the humble one, received **Master Tiěbì’s** **Precepts** from **Zōu Jūn**:\n*\"Block the Heavenly River (Tiānhé),*\n*Lift the Dipper’s Handle (Dǒubǐng),*\n*Draw Water from the Stygian Depths (Cāngmíng),*\n*Shake the Nine Regions (Jiǔzhōu),*\n*Use the Heavenly Stem (Jiān) to supplement the Earthly Branch (Kūn),*\n*And the *Li* hexagram to seal the *Kǎn* trigram.*\n*Opening the eyes to gaze upward is **Yáng** (否→泰),*\n*Closing them to observe internally is **Yīn** (泰→否).\"*\n\nMany fail to grasp the shortcuts of the **Dao/Way**,\nYet forcefully claim these **mysteries of the Ancients** (Xuān jī) as their own,\nEstablishing false sects—\nHow could they not err?\n\nI have devoted my life to mastering **Thunder Dao** (Léifǎ),\nYet none have explained it as clearly as **Master Yuèdǐng Mò** (Mò Jūn).\nHis teachings make me ponder day and night,\nYet I cannot see him again—\nOnly sighing in disappointment.\n\nWhile **Master** was alive,\nStudents flocked in confusion,\nYet few truly received his transmission—\nFor they did not know the **Dao/Way** at all.\n\nNow in my old age,\nI wish to leave these **secret precepts** (Mìjué) for the world,\nBut find no true listener to converse with—\nThus I compose these **illustrations**,\nNaming them *\"**Subtle Dao/Way Precepts** (Dàofǎ Jīngwēi).\"*\n\n**Illustration of Observing the Dao/Way Precepts:**\nTo **uphold the Dao/Way Precepts** (Xíngchí dàofǎ) is to begin and end with **one steadfast principle** (Rùnběi yīzhǐ),\nAnd thus attain **transcendence** (Xiān).\nFor those who practice the **Dao/Way Precepts**,\nThey must first **receive and uphold the Ten Precepts** (Shíjiè).\nIn daily life, they must never falter.\nIf they further **alleviate greed and rescue suffering**,\nAnd **accumulate merit through righteous actions** (Jīgōng lěixíng),\nThey will naturally move Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Gods** will be reverent,\n**Demons** will submit,\nAnd they will command **Thunder Dao** (Léishén) to serve them—\nSummoning winds and calling rains.\n\nYet there are some later disciples,\nWho do not **uphold the precepts** (Chí lǜ),\nNor **discern right from wrong** (Biàn yézhèng),\nBut cling to words and symbols,\nConcocting wild and chaotic thoughts.\nIf they experience a fleeting moment of inspiration,\nThey already deem themselves satisfied.\nThey do not investigate the **ultimate source of that inspiration**,\nAnd thus **invite evil by their deeds**,\n**Summon demons by their actions**.\n\nHence, **Master Sàzhēn** said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way Precepts** are not trifling—\nReflect on **upholding the precepts** and it will chill your heart.\nEasier than a thousand-year iron tree blooming,\nHarder than entering **Dàochéng** (邓都) to manifest in the world.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"If your words are pure yet your actions are foul, do not speak of the **Dao/Way**,\nFor those who disregard the **Precepts of Heaven** (Tiāntiáo) merely engage in empty rituals.\"*\n\n**Master Bǎoyī** was asked:\n*\"How does one **subdue evil** (Zhì yé)?\"\nHe replied:\n*\"Cultivate yourself to become upright (Xiū jǐ yǐ zhèng).\nIf you do not hear of the **deceitful spirits of flowers and moonlight** (Huāyuè zhī yāo),\nYou will not dare to approach **Officer Liàng** (Gōng).*\n**Upright individuals** are already feared by **ghosts and spirits**,\nHow much more so for those who practice the **Dao/Way Precepts**?\"\n\nIn my *\"**Heart Transmission Record** (Xīnchuán Lù)\"* I wrote:\n*\"First, **uphold the precepts** as the foundation,\nThen **guard the Precepts of Heaven** without recklessness.\nTo **attract the Thunder Spirit** (Léishén) and make it bow in submission,\nThe **Thunder Spirit’s** roar and lightning’s strike must pierce your heart and reveal its depths.\"*\n\n**Illustration of the Heart’s Ten Thousand *Dharmas*:**\n*\"All *dharmas* arise from the heart,\nAll *dharmas* are extinguished by the heart.*\nUnderstanding their origin and cessation,\nThe matter of **birth and death** is resolved.\"*\n\nFor the **heart** is the **master of the body**,\nThe **root of all *dharmas*** (Wànfǎ zhī gēn).\nIts greatness knows no inner limit,\nIts smallness knows no outer boundary.\nWhen vast, it encompasses Heaven and Earth,\nWhen minute, it hides within the finest hair.\nCultivate it, and you become **Buddha or Immortal** (Zuòfó chéngxiān),\nNeglect it, and you turn into a **beast** (Pīmáo dài jiǎo).\nRetain it within, and it becomes **inherent nature** (Xìng),\nProject it outward, and it becomes **emotion** (Qíng).\nIts transformations are endless,\nYet it has no fixed moment.\n\nThus the **Sages** taught:\n*\"To cultivate the heart is to cultivate the **Dao/Way**,\nTo cultivate the **Dao/Way** is to cultivate the heart.\"*\n\n**Mencius** said:\n*\"Nurturing the heart is best done by **restraining desires** (Shǎo yù).\"*\n\n**Emperor Yáo** declared:\n*\"Heaven divides creation into **one central principle** (Yīzhōng),\nHumans weave their **patterns of life** (Jīnglún) from the heart.\"*\n\n**Master Xūqìng Tiānshī** taught:\n*\"When a single thought stirs within,\nThe **six senses** (Liùshí) flow outward.\nIf you do not **align with goodness** (Bèi shàn),\nYou will **align with evil** (Bèi è),\nThus inviting the **rewards of Heavenly Realms and punishments of Hellish States** (Yīn guǒ).\"*\n\nThe *\"**Great Dao Song** (Dàdào Gē)\"* states:\n*\"Do not retain anything in the **Soul’s Platform (Língtái)**,\nFor if **things** linger in the heart, the **Spirit** is not pure.\nThis **dissipates True Essence** and weakens the **vitality of the sinews** (Jīnggǔ).\"*\n\n**The Three Pure Ones (Sān Máo Zhēnjūn)** said:\n*\"The **Soul’s Platform** is clear as an ice bucket,\nOnly the **Original Spirit** (Yuánshén) may dwell there.\nIf you retain anything within it,\nYour entire life will be **impure**.\"*\n\n**Master Bǎoyī** stated:\n*\"If a method comes from the same **Dao/Way gate** (Tóngmén),\nIts **talismans** and **incantations** are identical,\nYet it proves ineffective—\nIt is because the **sincerity** is not complete.\nIf **sincerity** is incomplete,\nThen **self-confidence** is insufficient,\nAnd **doubt** arises—\nThe heart then has no **master** (Zhǔ).\nIf the heart has no **master**,\nHow can it **communicate with the divine** (Gǎn tōng)?\nThus it is said:\n*\"All methods are **heart methods** (Xīnfǎ),\nIf the heart is open, the methods will also be effective.\"*\n\nIn my *\"**Clarifying the Dao/Way** (Míngdào)\"* I wrote:\n*\"All things in the human world originate from the heart,\nThe heart’s essence is formless—where can one seek it?\nBefore a thought arises, one may grasp it,\nThen one begins to truly see the heart.\"*\n\n**Illustration of Pre-Heaven’s Original Essence:**\n*\"Faint and obscure, Pre-Heaven’s True Seed—\nUse it, and it is unseen,\nSee it, and it is unheard.*\n\nFor **Essence** is the **Original Essence of Pre-Heaven** (Xiāntiān Yuánjīng),\nThe **mother of all things**.\nObtain it, and you live,\nLose it, and you die.\nThus, if **Essence** abides, **Pre-Heaven’s *Qi*** (Xiāntiān qì) abides,\nIf **Pre-Heaven’s *Qi*** abides, the **Spirit** (Shén) abides—\nWhen these three abide, **my life is in my own hands** (Wǒ mìng wǒ),\nNot in the hands of **Heaven**.\n\nThe *\"**Heart Seal Scripture of the Jade Emperor** (Yùhuáng Xīnyìn Jīng)\"* says:\n*\"Each person has their own **Essence**,\nAnd **Essence** unites with their **Spirit**.\"*\n\n**Master Dòngbīn** said:\n*\"Nourish **Essence** to cultivate the **Spiritual Root** (Línggēn),\nNourish **Pre-Heaven’s *Qi*** to cultivate the **Spirit** (Shén)—\nThis is the **true True Essence** (Zhēnzhēn),\nBeyond which there is no greater truth.\"*\n\n**Master Zǐyáng** taught:\n*\"If you break the **bamboo**, you must first mend the **bamboo**,\nIf you overturn the **chicken**, you must use the **egg** to restore it.\nAll efforts are in vain,\nYet you strive to **obtain True Lead** (Zhēnqiān) and **merge with the Sacred Mechanism** (Shèng jī).\"*\n\nThe **Thunderous Adepts** must sever lust and extinguish desire,\nNurture the **Original Spirit** (Yuánshén),\nRefine the **Golden Elixir** (Jīndān),\nCommand thunder and lightning,\nPray for rain or clear skies,\nHeal sickness and subdue malevolence—\nNo power is beyond their reach.\n\nYet those who merely **clutch charcoal**—\nHow dare they speak of such things?\n\nThus **Master Sà** declared:\n*\"A single spark of **Sacred Light** (Língguāng) is the talisman itself—\nYet fools mistake ink and vermilion for its essence.\nWhen **Original Essence** (Yuánjīng) does not scatter,\nAnd **Original Yang** (Yuányáng) stands firm,\nAll demons and monsters are swept away.\"*\n\n**Master Bǎoyī** said:\n*\"The talisman is the instrument of **Yin-Yang harmony** (Yīnyáng qìhé),\nOnly those of **utter sincerity** (zhìchéng) can wield it.\nIf sincerity is not absolute,\nIts power remains inert.\nThus it is said:\n*'With my **Essence**, I merge with the **Essence** of Heaven and Earth and all things.\nWith my **Spirit**, I merge with the **Spirit** of Heaven and Earth and all things.\n**Essence** seeks **Essence**, **Spirit** leans on **Spirit**—\nThat is why even a scrap of paper,\nWhen inscribed with **sincere intent**, can summon ghosts and gods.\nFor if the will is not true,\nNo talisman shall answer.'*\n\nMy *Heart-Transmitted Record* (Xīnchuán Lù) states:\n*\"What makes the **Law** so potent?\nIt lies within your **Essence, *Qi*, and Spirit**.\nWhen **Essence** and **Qi** gather, **Spirit** is present—\nDemons and monsters dissolve into dust.\"*\n\n---\n**The Primordial Black Diagram of Pre-Heaven**\n*The talisman has no fixed form—\nIt is the **living *Qi*** of the **Golden Pill** (Huánwán),\nBringing peace to healing.\nBreathe, and winds and clouds arise—\nIn an instant, issue commands,\nAnd ghosts and gods tremble in awe.*\n\nFor **Qi** is the **Original *Qi*** of Pre-Heaven,\nThe **Root *Qi*** of all things.\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever flowing.\n\nAs the **Master** said in the *Systematic Classic* (Xìyì):\n*\"Heaven and Earth in vapory fusion,\nAll things refined in purity.\"*\nTruly, the **Original *Qi*** of man\nResembles the **Qi** of Heaven and Earth.\nWith one **inhalation**, Heaven’s **Qi** descends;\nWith one **exhalation**, Earth’s **Qi** ascends.\nBetween breath and breath,\n**Golden Liquid** is born, the form refined.\nForm and **Spirit** both attain perfection,\nMerging with the **Dao** and **True Reality**.\n\nThe *Heart Seal Scripture of the Jade Emperor* says:\n*\"Each person has their own **Qi**,\nAnd **Qi** unites with the **True Body** (Zhēntǐ)—\nThose who cannot hold fast to their **True Reality** (Zhēn)\nAre but empty names.\"*\n\n**Zhuangzi** taught:\n*\"The breath of ordinary men lingers in the throat,\nBut the **True Person’s** breath dwells in the heel.\"*\n\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* (Sūwèn) states:\n*\"In stillness, purity—\n**True *Qi*** follows naturally.\nIf one knows to **embrace whiteness** (báibǎi) and **guard *Qi***,\nModerate in food, cautious in speech,\nAnd constantly stir the **Perverse Wind** (Xùnfēng) within the **Primordial Sea** (Yuánhǎi),\nThen infinite marvels shall be received.\"*\n\nThus **Mencius**, roused by the crowing of a cock,\nDiligently cultivated the **Boundless *Qi*** (Hàorán).\n\n**Master Bǎoyī** declared:\n*\"To harmonize the **Three Powers** (Sāncái)—\nIt is but **one *Qi***.\nHeaven moves by **Qi**,\nEarth generates by **Qi**,\nYin and Yang expand and contract by **Qi**,\nWind and thunder arise by **Qi**.\n**Qi** is mastered by man—\nExternal thoughts do not intrude,\nInternal thoughts do not stray.\nWith single-minded harmony,\nReturn to the **Root** and reclaim the **Mandate**,\nMoving, resting, or sitting—\nEndlessly nurturing the **Boundless**,\nApplying it to **Law**,\nMerging my **True *Qi*** with Heaven and Earth’s creation.\nThus, a breath becomes cloud,\nA sigh becomes thunder—\nWhen wielded, the **Original Spirit** is spontaneously potent,\nAnd demons cower in submission.\nPiercing Heaven, traversing Earth,\nIn myriad transformations—\nWho dares defy me?\"*\n\nMy *Heart-Transmitted Record* says:\n*\"The **Primordial *Qi*** builds the **Elixir Field**—\nIn stillness, wisdom dawns.\nSealed within, the curtain drawn,\nYet the **Soundless Flute** (wúkǒng dí) plays unseen.\"*\n\n---\n**The Primordial Spirit Diagram of Pre-Heaven**\n*\"To walk or sit together—\nIt lies right before you.\nDo not stray from this truth.\"*\n\n*\"To perceive it—you cannot see,\nTo hear it—you cannot hear.\nIts transformations are boundless,\nIts coming and going unrestricted.\n\nWhen pure and serene, it abides;\nWhen turbulent and chaotic, it vanishes.\nThus, the *Jade Sovereign Heart-Seal Scripture* states:\n‘The Spirit can enter stone,\nThe Spirit can take flight in form.’\n\nThe Most High says:\n‘The **Great Dao** cannot be conveyed through words or received by mouth,\nYet it must be attained through an empty heart and tranquil Spirit—\nThe Dao comes of itself.\n\nThe foolish do not know this,\nSo they exhaust their bodies,\nTorment their minds,\nConscript their wills,\nAgitate their Spirits—\nAnd the Dao only recedes further.\n\nThe *Daoist Virtue* says:\n‘The Spirit of the Valley does not die,\nThis is called the **Mysterious Mother** [Xuānmǔ].\nThe **Mysterious Mother’s Gate**,\nThis is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth** [Tiāndì zhī gēn].\nThe **Master of Emptiness and Stillness** says:\n‘If the Spirit departs, then quickly summon it back.\nWhen the Spirit returns to the body’s *Qi*, it spontaneously recycles itself.\nThus, day after day, evening after evening,\nThe **True Infant** [Zhēnzǐ] bears the **True Embryo** [Zhēn tāi] naturally.’\n\nThe **One True Person** says:\n‘In the world, there are those who close their eyes and store the Spirit,\nFantasizing that it will emerge from some direction.\nOthers twitch their pens and writhe their bodies,\nManipulating internal *Qi* to merge with external *Qi*—\nAlas, how deluded!\n\nIf the Spirit is obtained,\nIts potency will naturally manifest.\nJust reside in stillness,\nAnd on days of leisure, cultivate the Spirit—\nWhen tranquil, the Spirit will spontaneously awaken.\nHarmonize the **Polar *Qi*** [Chōng qì],\nAnd the *Qi* will naturally become true.\nApply it in action and practice,\nAnd the Spirit will naturally merge.\nWhen Spirit and *Qi* merge,\nA single thought or movement,\nThe Spirit’s **Officials and Soldiers** [Shìbīng] surge forth,\nAs if present at your side.’\n\nMy *Heart-Transmitted Record* says:\n‘Only when the **Numinous Platform** [Língtái] is pure and clear,\nCan one truly perceive it.\nThe slightest dust obscures it—\nTo transcend birth and death, it must be eternally preserved.\nYet common mortals fail to recognize its face.’\n\n---\n\n**The Primordial Spirit Diagram of the Pre-Heaven Mysterious Pass**\n\n‘This Pass is the **Primordial Spirit’s Gate** [Xuānguān],\nThe **Mysterious Pass** [Xuānguān]—\nWithin it lie concealed the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth,\nThe sun, moon, and stars,\nThe Three Elements and Eight Trigrams,\nThe Four Symbols and Five Phases,\nThe Twenty-Four *Qi* [Èrshísì qì],\nThe Seventy-Two Constellations [Sìshí'èr hòu],\nThe winds, clouds, thunder, lightning, and rain—\nAll are contained therein.\n\nThe **One True Person** says:\n‘To write talismans without knowing the Pass,\nIs to invite the laughter of demons and spirits.’\n\nToday’s practitioners of Daoist **Law** and **Method** [Fǎxíng],\nNot

Spirit** [Zìjǐ yuánshén].\nThus, the Spirit never departs from the *Qi*,\nAnd the *Qi* never departs from the Spirit.\nThe Spirit is the **child** of the *Qi*,\nAnd the *Qi* is the **mother** of the Spirit—\nChild and mother are intimate,\nLike magnet and iron,\nNever to be separated for an instant.\n\nTo contain it becomes **Golden Elixir** [Jīndān],\nTo release it becomes **Officials and Soldiers** [Shìbīng].\nThus, **Master Zhōng** says:\n‘Ten thousand words and a thousand teachings urge later generations,\nDo not seek the True in external things—\nBoring through Heaven, descending to Earth, relying on whose strength?\nThe **marvelous uses** of **Spirit-Penetration** [Shén tōng] must come from the Spirit itself.’\n\n**Master Pīyún** says:\n‘When my body moves, Spirits and Immortals arise—\nNot from toiling over the mind or manipulating thoughts.’\n\n**Master Wáng Shìchén** says:\n‘To exhaust the Spirit all day in vain discussions of emptiness,\nIs not as good as returning to rest within the **Embryo** [Tāi].\nThe **Dao** endlessly flows, naturally communicating itself,\nThe **Three Elements** and **Five Elders** [Sān yuán/Wǔ lǎo] are born from this very function.\nMy **True Person** is neither in the West nor in the East,\nYet I always teach that a **gentle wind** arises within the body.\nPeople see one thing but fail to recognize another—\nEach time they store the thought, it becomes void again.’\n\nThe **Jade Hare True Person** says:\n‘When the mind moves, the person follows in the blink of an eye—\nWhy labor over storing and summoning such difficulty?\nTo grasp the **logic of the Five Phases’ Generation and Pacification** [Wǔxíng shēngkè],\nThe **thunder and rain of the palm** [Zhǐ shōng yǔ] are in accord with the **Golden Elixir** [Jīndān].’\n\nMaster Liu says:\n‘Not law, not emptiness, not form—\nNo shape, no mark, no sentiment.\nThe Dao is but one pure thing, clear and limpid—\nWhat need for idle names or sectarian labels?\n\nWhen it moves, ghosts and spirits cower in concealment;\nWhen it stirs, heaven and earth merge in union.\nYou cannot see it, cannot hear it—\nYet when silently applied, it responds in kind.\n\nFrom my *Record of Heart Transmission*:\nEach person holds within them a boundless *Qian* and *Kun*,\nWhere stands a towering, singular Sovereign.\nHe governs all spirits across the Three Realms in submission,\nYet they know not they waste their vital essence and spirit.\n\n**Drilling the Five Phases Diagram:**\nSpirit, soul, ether, mind—\nDrill them back to the *Kun* position.\nNo need to stir a hair—\nNaturally, thunder and rain arrive.\n\nNow, the numbers one, two, three, four—\nThese are the *Five Phases’* generative digits of heaven,\nSix, seven, eight, nine, ten—\nThe completed numbers of earth.\n\nHumans inherit the generative and completed numbers of heaven and earth’s *Five Phases*,\nThus heaven has the Five Stars,\nEarth has the Five Sacred Peaks,\nAnd humans have the Five Viscera.\n\nWithin the Five Viscera lie spirit, soul, ether, mind—\nThese coalesce into the Five Thunders.\nAmong the Five Thunders, earth holds preeminence,\nFor it draws upon the primordial *hun* of the Central Yellow—\nThe ancestral *qi* of the Preheaven Undifferentiated.\n\nThus, Master Preserve-One says:\n‘The marvelous law harmonizes with yin and yang,\nSquare and round, motion and stillness—\nThus the Dao permeates all.’\n\nThe Three Powers—heaven, earth, and humanity—\nRespond to the *Five Phases* as water, fire, wood, metal, and earth,\nCirculate through the five directions—east, south, west, north, and center,\nAnd correspond to the eight trigrams: thunder, wind, mountain, water, fire, heaven, earth, and lake.\n\nThose ensnared by numerology say:\n*“When I inscribe a talisman for a certain matter,\nYou must activate it at a specific orifice—\nThus do we engage with Nature’s transformations,\nThus do we speak of Generation and Pacification,\nThus do we draw the brush,\nThus do we unleash the surge—\nAnd I have mastered the mechanisms of ghosts and spirits.”*\n\nYet they do not realize:\nBefore the *Tai Ji* differentiated,\nWhich was yin, which was yang?\nWhich were the Three Powers?\nWhich were the *Five Phases*?\nWhich were the Eight Trigrams?\n\nThus, those who grasp the Dao abandon their reliance on talismans and seals.\n\nFrom my *Record of Heart Transmission*:\nOne, two, three, four, five—\nEarth holds primacy in the center.\nMaster the logic of life and death,\nAnd thunder and rain rise at your command.\n\n**The Diagram of Returning to the Root and Restoring Life:**\nWhen all yin is exhausted, return to the single stroke—\nYang is born, and heaven and earth emerge from the heart of heaven and earth.\nThe heart of heaven and earth—\nTo grasp the true transformation within,\nTo command thunder, enslave lightning,\nAnd have ghosts and spirits stand in awe.\n\nThe wood of the East Three generates the fire of the South Two,\nThe metal of the West Four produces the water of the North One,\nAnd the Central Earth harmonizes with the *Wu Ji* transformations of *Wu* and *Ji*.\n\nIf not for metal subduing wood and water countering fire,\nThen winds, clouds, thunder, lightning, and rain would not arise.\n\nThus, the *Bao Yi Zhuren* says:\n*\"Zhuangzi spoke: 'The corpse lies still, yet the dragon appears in the depths;\nSilent, yet thunder resounds.'\"*\n\nThose who know this Dao can speak of the mechanics of motion and stillness.\n\nMaster Shao said:\n*\"Between every motion and stillness lies the utmost subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and Man.\"*\n\nFor indeed, the use of motion and stillness lies in the extremes of yin and yang.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"At the extreme, transformation occurs; transformation brings harmony.\"*\n\nWho but those who cultivate with true force can comprehend this?\n\nFrom my *Record of Heart Transmission*:\n*\"Qi flows in cycles, coming and going—\nObserve where yin and yang prevail.\nRestore balance in all things—\nThis truth, with whom shall it be shared?\"*\n\n**The Diagram of Thunder and Lightning’s Essence:**\nThunder and lightning’s transformations are mastered within,\nHeaven and Earth’s Three Powers move as one.\nIf scholars can penetrate this,\nThey command the heavens to bring rain or clear skies.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams encompass Heaven and Earth,\nFifteen lines arrayed, yet their essence lies in the Central Five.\nThus, thunder and lightning draw upon the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd are called the Five Thunders.\n\nFor those who practice thunder’s art must:\nEmpty the heart while filling the belly,\nConcentrate the spirit and guard the center,\nTurning the transformations,\nCommanding thunder and lightning,\nSpreading sweet rains to save the people,\nTheir merit reaching Heaven—\nHow could this be called a minor achievement?\n\nFrom my *Record of Heart Transmission*:\n*\"Transformations contain the *Tai Ji* within,\nSince the divine function of waxing and waning began.\nWhen the Six Yang numbers return to *Kun*,\nThunder and lightning surge from the *Kan Dragon*.\n**The Diagram of Water and Fire’s Excitement and Subduction:**\nIts subtlety requires no talismans or secret incantations—\nThose who grasp this mechanism summon rain and thunder instantly.\"*\n\nFor the sun and moon are *Kan* and *Li*,\n*Kan* and *Li* are water and fire,\nWater and fire are *qi*,\nAnd *qi* is matter.\n\nIn the South, it is fire; in the North, it is water.\nExcessive fire-qi brings drought,\nExcessive water-qi brings floods.\n\nWater subdues fire, turning clear skies to rain,\nFire generates water, turning rain to clear skies.\nWater and fire, when excited and subdued, become thunder and lightning,\nWater and fire, when harmonized, bring clear and bright *qi*.\n\nYet fire’s excess and water’s vigor cannot be balanced.\nThus, my *Record of Heart Transmission* says:\n*\"Fire flourishes in *Li*, water thrives in *Kan*.\nWater and fire must be balanced—\nIf one prevails, there is no mercy.\"*\n\n**The Diagram of Yin and Yang’s Transformations:**\nMotion and stillness never cease,\nYet return to the *Tai Ji*.\nWithout diligent practice,\nHow could one understand?\n\nFor *qi* in motion has purity and turbidity.\nThe pure ascends as yang,\nThe turbid descends as yin.\nYin and yang transform in myriad ways.\n\nThus, yin and yang’s ascent and descent form rain,\nYin and yang’s excitement produce thunder,\nYin and yang’s condensation become lightning,\nYin and yang’s relaxation yield snow,\nWeak yin and strong yang bring wind,\nStrong yin and weak yang bring clouds,\nExcessive yin and scattered yang bring dew,\nSuppressed yin and condensed yang bring frost,\nObstructed yin and yang bring hail,\nUnbalanced ascent and descent bring fog,\nUncontrolled *sha-qi* brings pestilence,\nPerverse *qi* clashing with the true brings *sha*,\nExcessive water transforms into *ni* (halo),\nExcessive fire transforms into *chi* (dark clouds).\n\nThose who practice thunder must not be ignorant of these principles.\n\nThus, my *Record of Heart Transmission* says:\n*\"Qi cycles through purity and turbidity—\nThe pure ascends, the turbid descends; balance is key.\nExcessive yin and deficient yang bring prolonged rain,\nExcessive yang and deficient yin bring lasting clear skies.\"*\n\nKing Zhen’s *Manting Fang*:\n*\"With resolute sincerity in the Dao,\nDiligently cultivating the Way,\nAll greenery is seen through as emptiness.\nWithin the cauldron of the Great Void,\nA jade lotus is nurtured.\nTransformed into a divine pearl, radiant,\nIlluminating a thousand peaks.\nThe eternal spring scene—\nOn the Five-Cloud Platform,\nJade oranges glow red against the sky.\nThese wondrous principles, if met with fate,\nTruly, a thousand miles apart, yet untainted by dust,\nPure and clear, revealing true function.\nDaily, the head remains unclouded,\nTranscending birth and death,\nBeyond the Three Realms’ grasp,\nFree and at ease, everywhere a celestial palace.\nA single point of yang essence,\nPaired in the yin position,\nThe Five Phases and Four Symbols complete—\nSuddenly, forms emerge,\nDazzling, boundless.\nDivine water frequently irrigates,\nWithin the Three Fields,\nWarm fire simmers and brews.\nKnowing this,\nAt the gate of entry, essence and function merge,\nThe mind stilled in gentle repose.\nWithin lies the golden serpent and jade seal,\nThunder and rain summoned in the heart-field—\nDo you know?\nThe rules of the immortals:\nWhen practice reaches three thousand,\nThe law lies in the preheaven’s profound mystery,\nUnspeakable, yet rooted in centrality and rectitude.\n\nThe spiritual platform gleams, motionless in stillness,\nYet responsive and harmonious.\nRelying on firmness and vigor,\nCommanding wind and thunder,\nPraying for rain and snow,\nSubduing ghosts and spirits, banishing demons—\nThis alone is the way,\nNeither incantation, nor talisman, nor *gangjue*.\n\nThe *Tai Ji* spirit dwells within the *Yuan Gu*,\nPreheaven *qi* resides in the *Xuan Guan* orifice.\nDiligently preserve the spirit in emptiness and stillness,\nAnd upon completion, one joins the ranks of the immortals.\n\nBehold the Great Void—\nSteadily riding the auspicious clouds,\nApproaching the Golden Gate.\nThe Dao’s heart transmission is complete.\"",

      "translated_text": "**\"The Transmission of Dao by Heart**\n*Scripture Title:* **The Transmission of Dao by Heart**\n*Composed by:* Yuan Wang Weiyong. One scroll.\n*Source:* *The Orthodox Daoist Canon (Zhengtong Daozang)*, First Section.\n\n---\n\n**The Transmission of Dao by Heart**\n\nI, from my youth, ardently pursued the Dao and its methods, sparing neither labor nor hardship, seeking instruction from masters—how many were they? The world inquires about the **play of the Mystic Pass (Xuanguān)** and the **essence of the Dark Mother (Xuānmǔ)**.\n\nThey say: The Mystic Pass lies between the two kidneys, one *cùn* and three *fēn* below the navel. The Bright Hall (Mingtang) and the Six Harmonies (Liùhé), the Elixir Field (Dantian), the mouth and nostrils—these are the Dark Mother.\n\nThe world inquires about the **Five Phases’ generation and conquest**, the subtleties of **water and fire’s clashing and stripping**.\n\nThey say: The Five Phases—metal, wood, earth, water, fire—are arranged in a **crossed pattern within the well-diagram (jǐngzì)**, thus generating and conquering. **Silk talismans and brick seals** are cast into water, producing **judgmental sounds (píngyù)**, thus achieving clashing and stripping.\n\nI pondered these teachings and feared they did not yet reach the **Mystic Depths**. Thus, for over thirty years, I observed the gathering and scattering of clouds, the shifts in **qi and climate**, silently merging with their essence, my joy unknowable.\n\nBy fortune of past lives, I also encountered a **Sage of the Highest Order**, and in a single word, I attained certainty without doubt.\n\nFor the **movement and stillness of Heaven and Earth**, the **revolution of sun and moon**, the **order of the Four Seasons**, the **emergence of all things**—all arise from the **wondrous flow of the Supreme Ultimate (Tàijí)**. The Sage cannot describe it; they name it **Divine (Shén)**.\n\nThis Divine is neither green nor white, neither red nor black, neither fire nor water, neither square nor round. It spans the ancient and the present, dwelling within the human heart. When the heart is **pure and still**, it abides; when **filth and turbidity** arise, it vanishes.\n\nThus, when **essence (jīng)** is settled, **qi** is settled; when **qi** is settled, **spirit (shén)** is settled. When these three are settled, the **Dao and its methods are complete**.\n\nDispersed, it becomes **wind and clouds**; gathered, it manifests as **thunder and lightning**. It emerges as **generals and officers**; it returns as **the Golden Elixir (Jīndān)**.\n\nAlas, later scholars **wander in false paths**, lost in the **sea of desire**, severing their **original nature (běnzhēn)**, clinging to **written texts** as if they were treasures. This is **abandoning the True for the False**, seeking the ox while riding it.\n\nThus, **Master Sa** said:\n*A single spark of luminous spirit is the talisman—*\n*Yet fools mistake ink for cinnabar.*\n\n*When spirit does not scatter, Original Yang is steadfast,*\n*Ten thousand demons and monsters are swept away.*\n\n**Master Xu Jing** said:\n*If spirit departs, draw it back.*\n*When spirit returns to the body, qi flows naturally.*\n*Thus, morning and evening, returning again and again,*\n*The True Child is born from the womb of innocence.*\n\nHow much more so—**every person has their share**; all may attain this.\nWhy abandon oneself and willingly descend to the **Nine Abysses**?\nThis is truly lamentable.",

their own **Heaven and Earth**,\nWithin which stands a **Sovereign Most High**.\nCommanding all spirits across the Three Realms,\nYet fools waste their vital essence in vain.\n\n**Mystic Applications**\nAscending to Heaven or descending to Earth—\nFire cannot burn, water cannot drown.\nFilling the boundless void, encompassing all forms,\nYet unseen when gazed upon, unheard when listened to.\n\n**Mysterious Womb**\nA hollow orifice—root of Heaven and Earth,\nEndlessly dense, yet no wind passes through.\nVague and distant, yet containing form,\nWhen the True Person emerges, a **Precious Pearl** is born.\n\n**True Earth**\n**Yin and Yang** unite as the **Yellow Mother**,\nHeaven and Earth have no recourse.\nDay and night they cling together,\nYet remain unaware of their own grinding.\n\n**True Seed**\nThe **Primordial One**—called **True Lead**—\nPlanted in **Kun** when born in **Qian**.\nNurtured for three years until ripe,\nThen wandering the **Penglai Isles** as an

arises, that is the **True Heart**,\nBut as soon as deliberation begins, it becomes the **Deluded Heart**.\nOnly when the heart is still does the Spirit truly live,\nAnd in unbounded freedom, even ghosts and gods revere.\n\n**The Void is Within Me**\nAll things are empty, yet **Nature** is not empty—\nThoughts lurk hidden in the **Great Void**.\nComing and going without constraint,\nI let the sun and moon rise and set as they will.\n\n**The Stem of *Hai* Wood**\n**Xun Wood** planted in *Hai* in autumn—\nIts vitality transforms endlessly.\nTo know where **Shedding returns to the

      "translated_text": "**The True Nature of Life and Death**\nThe birth-and-death cycle is but one true thing,\nIts root arises from illusion’s stir—thus the self comes to be.\nIf great afflictions breed all suffering,\nReturn to the origin, restore the primal—free yourself from worldly dust.\n\n**The Six Demons of Disturbance**\nSix demons dwell within the body, tormenting mortals,\nYet none seize the moment to cultivate virtue’s harmony.\nDay by day they fade, leaving no trace—\nOnly the radiant gold-light reveals their true nature.\n\n**The Difficulty of Being Human**\nTo ponder quietly in this world is hard,\nEnduring myriad trials of mortal life.\nWhen you reach the end of water and mountain,\nOnly then does the body find true peace.\n\n**Gold from the Ore**\nHuman hearts must align with Heaven’s will,\nTurning iron rods to needles through deep practice.\nWait until the fire of refinement burns away—\nThen the ore is exhausted, and true gold remains.\n\n**Act When the Mind Strayeth**\nMind-monkeys and will-horses race in tandem,\nThrough the twelve hours—do not act in folly.\nThe moment a thought strays, strike it down,\nEven if you sink into deep confusion.\n\n**Doubt in All Matters**\nZhang Hu saw a pig wallowing in mud,\nA cartload of ghosts causing chaos and strife.\nThe world holds nothing inherently strange—\nWhy create doubt where none should arise?\n\n**The Body Is Not Eternal**\nThe four elements are borrowed, not truly yours,\nTemporarily lodged in this dusty realm, not permanent.\nJoy or sorrow, grief or delight—\nDo not wait until death to play the fool.\n\n**The Art of True Abiding**\nMaster the somersault on the high pole,\nDig to find Heaven—it is the same as Earth.\nAll things fall silent in the true realm’s mystery,\nWhile mortals still debate life and death in vain.\n\n**Clay Spirits and Dragon-Capturing**\nClay spirits sink into water, losing their radiance,\nDragons are seized and led to the Jade Capital.\nNo single punch is struck to shatter them—\nThe moon rises over the sea, tides turn calm.\n\n**The Iron Ox Cultivates the Golden Lotus**\nAn iron ox plows the earth, sowing golden lotuses,\nRequiring no labor or coin.\nHeaven’s River waters nourish them,\nFlowers bloom, their fragrance filling the sky.\n\n**The Puppet of Thread**\nHuman life is a puppet pulled by a thread,\nDragged forward without daring to retreat.\nWhen the thread snaps, it cannot rise again—\nWhat use are grandchildren to a lifeless eye?\n\n**Money as Master**\nMen toil endlessly for wealth’s sake,\nLosing time in sorrow, rejoicing in gain.\nMasked as ghosts or men, they play their roles—\nLook closely, and you see only yourself.\n\n**Learning Knows No Order**\nHidden truths are hard to fathom—do not deceive yourself,\nFor learning has no strict order, only high and low.\nBefore probing the depths of mystery,\nDo not presume to judge before others.\n\n**Discerning the Wise and Foolish**\nWe transmit the heart’s truth in learning,\nIgnoring Heaven’s secrets through blunt speech.\nOnly the virtuous understand in silence,\nRecognizing wisdom through mutual resonance.\n\n**No Need for External Seeking**\nThough you bow to a hundred masters,\nEach may boast of grand pretensions.\nAsk east, and they point west—\nHarmony is lost, like discordant strings.\n\n**Striving with Resolute Will**\nFervently practicing the Thunder Method,\nNo place in the world can satisfy its demands.\nThirty years of effort—\nOnly then does the heart find peace.\n\n**What Is Practice?**\nFirst, uphold precepts as the root,\nThen guard Heaven’s laws—do not act in folly.\nTo summon the Thunder God to submission,\nIts crashes and flashes must split the heart open.\n\n**Practice Comes First**\nTo become an immortal through methods,\nPractice must precede all else.\nSave the people, ease their suffering,\nAnd ascend to Heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**Speak and Act in Truth**\nSpeak truly, and it shall be done—\nNo need for further exhortation.\nIf this life is squandered,\nYou shall sink into endless confusion for eons.\n\n**Unity of Essence and Function**\nDao is the essence of the method,\nThe method is the function of Dao.\nWhen essence and function align,\nThe Three Realms merge into one.\n\n**Orthodoxy Conquers Heresy**\nThe Ancestors established law within the heart,\nAnd only when the heart’s law is mastered\nAre all laws understood.\nWith orthodoxy, heresy is subdued—\nThen even flowers and moon fear Liang Gong.\n\n**The Law’s Miraculous Power**\nHow does the law manifest its power?\nIt does not leave the black essence within the body.\nWhen qi and spirit gather, the spirit abides,\nAnd myriad demons dissolve into dust.\n\n**Exhausting Principle to Know Fate**\nExhausting principle and nature reveals destiny,\nIgnorance of truth is the greatest ailment.\nWhen crows fly, fish leap, and cranes cry in the mist,\nMastery of transcendence leads to sainthood.\n\n**Harmonizing Yin and Yang**\nObserve Heaven’s way and follow its movements,\nOnly then does Yin and Yang truly unite.\nToday, I reveal this to you—\nDo not treat these words as commonplace.\n\n**Man Is Inferior to Things**\nHumans are the most enlightened of creatures,\nYet things often surpass them.\nObserve the serpent coiled around stone,\nHiding until spring’s return.\n\n**Hiding with the Thunder**\nTo practice the Thunder Method,\nAlways follow the thunder’s concealment.\nPerfecting true transformation,\nOnly then may you act and spread its power.\n\n**Seals and Talismans**\nTalismans, seals, and incantations are but written tools,\nTheir power lies in cultivation and focused thought.\nSilent stillness reveals Heaven’s heart,\nAnd every response aligns with subtle truth.\n\n**Sacrificing to Summon Evil**\nSlaughtering life to harm others while invoking the Thunder General\nOnly invites malevolent spirits to appear.\nThe virtuous and upright do otherwise—\nWith sincerity, all things communicate with Heaven.\n\n**The Talisman’s True Power**\nInk and vermilion cannot make a talisman sacred,\nIts power lies in the original spirit-qi.\nWhen transformation and movement are known,\nThe marrow-palace heals, and peace is restored.\n\n**Lift and It Is Done**\nNurture the spirit, and it becomes divine—\nNo need to close your eyes to store the mind.\nEvery thought and impulse flows within—\nA single spark of light never leaves the body.\n\n**The Ebb and Flow of Yin and Yang**\nAlways watch the Dipper’s handle in the sky,\nAs Yin wanes and Yang grows, passing in turn.\nThey form the four seasons, eight nodes,\nGiving birth to medicines too wondrous to proclaim.\n\n**Peeling and Returning**\nCreation enfolds the Great Ultimate,\nFrom peeling and returning, divine craft unfolds.\nWhen six Yangs are complete, they return to Kun,\nStirring thunder and lightning from the Kan Dragon.\n\n**Thunder’s Origin**\nWhen Heaven’s Yang grows bright and days lengthen,\nThe gentle wind stirs warmth, and the northern tide rises.\nOne Yang reaches Zheng—thunder emerges,\nThunder in Kun becomes its voice.\n\n**Thunder’s Fury**\nWood meets fire’s vigor, heat then arises,\nThe turbulent southern wind disrupts the Five Phases.\nStirring thunder’s crash brings transformation,\nCold follows, obscuring clarity.\n\n**What Is Thunder?**\nYang-one is thunder, Yin-two is lightning,\nYin and Yang’s qi fluctuates in excess or lack.\nWhen Yin contains Yang to its extreme, it must release,\nStirring the sky-shaking, earth-rattling sound.",

      "translated_text": "「To discern the Thunder’s Aperture\nWind and cloud, thunder and rain are all concealed within One *Qi*.\nThis aperture is known to few—most fail to recognize its truth.\nStirring and peeling disrupt the Heavenly Dragon’s array,\nHalting wind and rain with a crashing, earth-shaking roar.\n\n**What Is Wind?**\nWhen Heaven’s *Qi* shifts and transforms, it becomes wind,\nWhich must divide into south and north, east and west.\nIt can bring forth life or take it away, summon rain or clear the sky,\nAnd at the moment of prayer, its power is manifest.\n\n**What Are Clouds and Rain?**\nWhen Earth’s *Qi* ascends and gathers, it forms clouds.\nDispersed as *Qi*, they coalesce into rain.\nRain emerges from mountains and rivers within,\nRise and observe—then you’ll know what to expect.\n**What Is Thunder?**\nWhen ripe fruits split open, their essence is revealed—\nThese principles must be thoroughly explored.\nWhen *Qi* is pent and steams the earth, dampness arises,\nStirring and peeling disrupt the balance of Yin and Yang.\n\n**What Is Rain?**\nDryness becomes wind, dampness turns to rain,\nIts transformations never stray from Earth.\nBut watch the steam from cooked rice—\nWhen fire arrives, its nature is revealed.\n\n**What Is Lightning?**\nWhen Yin ascends and Yang descends without passage,\nWater and fire churn, producing lightning’s flash.\nA golden radiance emerges, responding to divine intent,\nFollowed by thunder’s roar as *Qi* is discharged.\n\n**The River’s Omen**\nTo pray for rain or clear skies, one must know the River’s *Qi* and its season,\nFor its signs reveal the patterns of Heaven.\nWhen the Five Directions clash, wind and cloud converge,\nAnd the Thunder God is summoned to move at will.\n\n**Understanding Wind and Cloud**\nMountain winds stir *Qi*, summoning clouds and rain,\nHeaven’s Gate opens—wind is born.\nIf you grasp these pivotal moments,\nThunder and rain will fill the void.\n\n**The Power of One *Qi***\nOne *Qi* shifts and returns—\nLater, the dominance of Yin and Yang is seen.\nBringing back one transformation to peace,\nThis truth is shared with none but the wise.\n\n**Uneven Clarity and Turbidity**\nOne *Qi* cycles through turbidity and clarity,\nRising pure, descending foul—balance is essential.\nWhen Yin is excessive and Yang is weak, misty rain forms,\nWhen Yang is strong and Yin is wan, prolonged clear skies reign.\n\n**The Generations and Restrictions of the Five Phases**\nOne, two, three, four, five—\nEarth holds the center.\nKnowing the moments of generation and restriction,\nYou command thunder and rain with a single word.\n\n**Brightness and Darkness in Contrast**\nBrightness gives rise to darkness, darkness to brightness,\nTheir division clear—when rain ceases, skies brighten.\nRooted in Yin and Yang from the Great Ultimate,\nExamine their subtleties, near and far.\n\n**Balancing Water and Fire**\nFire gathers at noon’s peak,\nWater forms at the moon’s rise.\nWater and fire must be balanced,\nFor imbalance breeds chaos.\n\n**The Fluctuations of Yin and Yang**\n*Qi* shifts through the Heavenly Cycle, waxing and waning,\nLike the Yellow Bell’s seasonal rhythm, precise and unerring.\nDo not let Yin and Yang become disordered—\nFrost in June, thunder in October will follow.\n\n**The Moon’s Influence on Rain and Clear Skies**\nWhen the moon emerges at *Gēng* (庚), its side is even,\nThe first half of its cycle brings rain, the latter clear skies.\nTo know the mysteries of creation’s workings,\nListen to the magpie’s cry and the crow’s call—signs of coming weather.\n\n**The Sun’s Changes in *Qi***\nThe sun shifts from cold to hot, hot to cold,\nSouth wind turns to north—observe its flow.\nWho comprehends the reversals of Yin and Yang?\nTo know them is to never be deceived.\n\n**The Five Peaks Communicating with Heaven**\nIn Heaven they take form as symbols, on Earth as peaks,\nOne *Qi* cycles endlessly without pause.\nThe Five Peaks conceal the divine, mastering creation,\nWhen *Jiǎ* (甲) and *Gēng* (庚) meet, thunder and *Qi* surge.\n\n**The Four Seas’ Apertures**\nThe Four Seas have apertures piercing to the heavens,\nHeaven responds to stars, Earth to tides.\nOne breath, one inhalation—this is the subtle principle,\nThe *Lián* (屯) and *Méng* (蒙) hexagrams unite at dawn and dusk.\n\n**Contemplating Celestial Patterns**\nObserve Heaven without speaking of the Four Seasons’ march,\nThe *Qi* shifts, the myriad transformations busily unfold.\nFortune and calamity are revealed in signs,\nYet who among mortals truly seeks to understand?\n\n**Examining Earthly Geography**\nHeaven’s One *Qi* gives rise to Earth’s Two,\nWildflowers and grasses mirror the stars’ influence.\nMountains, rivers, seas, and peaks conceal their brilliance,\nWithin the vigorous *Qi*, each holds its form.\n\n**Creation’s Cyclical Flow**\nFive days form a *hòu* (候), two *Qi* form a cycle,\nThree cycles make a node—each has its meaning.\nYin and Yang distribute across the Heavenly Cycle,\nChewing these truths reveals their depth.\n\n**Subtle Principles Beyond Speech**\nWhen the sun reaches *Qián* (乾), it’s still before *Shēn* (申),\nAt night, turning from *Kǎn* (坎) to emerge as *Yín* (寅).\nDoes water fear fire, does fire fear water?\nThe Dragon rises with the *Qi*—its power is divine.\n\n**The Dynamics of Heaven and Earth**\nExtreme motion yields stillness, stillness breeds motion,\nBetween them lies the wondrous interplay.\nThere are clear skies, rain, wind, and cloud,\nThe Dipper’s handle at the Heavenly Heart governs all.\n\n**Predicting Rain and Clear Skies**\nYin and Yang move in their own time,\nTheir opposition never ceases.\nIf you know when rain and clear skies will come,\nPrayers to the divine will surely be answered.\n\n**Stirring and Peeling Yin and Yang**\nWind, cloud, thunder, and rain all originate from this,\nThe stirring and peeling of Yin and Yang—truly awe-inspiring.\nDo not waste effort on mere parchment study,\nOnly by probing the *Qi* of Heaven will you find its taste.\n\n**Regulating Drought and Flood**\nWhen *Qi* and climate align, drought and flood are absent,\nYet imbalance spawns chaos.\nThe Dipper’s handle shifts, the Heavenly Gate turns—\nAdjusting Yin and Yang, the Great Way prevails.\n\n**Thunder Rising from Earth**\nHeaven and Earth are daily sovereigns,\nYet thunder originates from Earth.\nWhen *Qi* is pent and steams, it bursts forth,\nRolling wind and cloud, summoning rain.\n\n**The Dragon Hidden in Pools and Caves**\nThe Dragon dwells in pools and caves,\nWhen *Qi* is pent, it leaps to life.\nWhen the Dragon’s time is at hand,\nWho dares underestimate its might?\n\n**Mist Transforming into Clouds**\nMist *Qi* arises at dawn, not in season,\nUnbroken rain follows without doubt.\nEndless clouds may appear, yet no rain—\nIf the time is not right, there’s no fixed rule.\n\n**Fire’s Omen for Clear Skies**\nWhen wind stirs the high heavens and the Four *Qi* are clear,\nFire clouds form—clear skies will follow.\nAs the sun traverses the land without fail,\nOnly when Yin’s time arrives will rain form.\n\n**Observing the Wind’s

Pre-Heaven’s single *Qi* and find nothing,\nThen the Post-Heaven’s work begins.\n\nAt midnight, if you sit with a clear mind,\nThis *Qi* will be known to emerge from **Great Emptiness (Tàixū)**.\nWhen **Yin** wanes and **Yang** thrives, drought follows,\nYet when **Yin** and **Yang** harmonize, abundance is sure.\nWhen **Yang** wanes and **Yin** thrives, floods arise,\nAnd when **Yin** and **Yang** clash, eclipses occur.\n\nThe **Five Thunders** are born of **Yin** and **Yang** *Qi*,\nShaped by the **Five Phases (Wǔxíng)**.\n**Yin** *Qi* descends and ascends in rhythm,\nResponding to the Dipper’s handle’s turning.\n\nThere is growth and decline, retreat and concealment.\nFrom **Winter Solstice (Dōngzhì)**, the **One Yang** emerges in the **Returning (Kàn) Hexagram**,\nThe **Two Yang** in the **Approaching (Lín) Hexagram**,\nThe **Three Yang** in the **Calm (Tài) Hexagram**,\nThe **Four Yang** in the **Great Strength (Dàzhuàng) Hexagram**.\n\nAt this time, *Qi* aligns with **Spring Equinox (Chūnfēn)**,\nThe **Perverse (Xùn) Wind** stirs, the earth’s moisture rises.\nBefore the **first lunar crescent (qiánxián)**, thunder begins to sound.\n\nThe **Five Yang** in the **Decaying (Guì) Hexagram**,\nThe **Six Yang** complete in the **Receptive (Kàn) Hexagram**—\n**Divine *Qi*** must unite,\nWaiting for the **Shaking (Zhèn)** to issue commands.\nWithout **Water** and **Fire** clashing and stripping,\nIt cannot manifest—thus, when **Yang** reaches its peak, **Yin** arises.\n\nFrom **Summer Solstice (Xiàzhì)**, the **One Yin** in the **Conception (Chèn) Hexagram**,\nThe **Two Yin** in the **Withdrawing (Dùn) Hexagram**,\nThe **Three Yin** in the **Obstructing (Pǐ) Hexagram**,\nThe **Four Yin** in the **Meeting (Gòu) Hexagram**.\n\nAt this time, *Qi* aligns with **Autumn Equinox (Qiūfēn)**,\nThe **Metal Wind** clears and stills, all trees scatter.\nBefore the **first lunar crescent (hòuxián)**, thunder retreats its voice.\n\nThe **Five Yin** in the **Shedding (Bō) Hexagram**,\nThe **Six Yin** complete in the **Earth (Kūn) Hexagram**—\n**Returning to the roots**, **reclaiming life**,\n**Preserving *Qi***, **nurturing spirit**.\nWhen **Yin** reaches its peak, **Yang** arises,\nAnd the cycle begins anew—\nThe **Dao/Way** of eternal transformation, never ceasing.\n\nThose who **summon thunder** must penetrate **Yin** and **Yang**,\nDeepen their grasp of **creation’s workings (Zàohuà)**,\nClarify the **Heaven-Earth’s shifting rhythms (Tīngdìngzhījī)**,\nDiscern the **changes in wind-thunder *Qi***,\nAnd know what **wind, thunder, and rain** truly are—\nFrom what they arise, why they stir,\nWhere they begin, how they correspond to months, days, and hours,\nWhich thunder they agitate—\nThen they wield the fury of **howling gales, sudden rains, crashing thunderbolts, and deafening peals**.\n\nYet **stirring must follow stillness**, and **stillness must precede stirring**—\nWho orchestrates this **logic of rise and fall**?\n\nI recall **Master Yīchuān (Zhú Xī)** asking **Master Shào Yàofū**:\n*\"Where will the thunder-wind arise this year?\"*\nThis single question encapsulates the **wondrous workings of creation**—\nWorthy of careful reflection and deep contemplation.\n\nIf you grasp this **one aperture’s passage**, all apertures are clear,\nIf one **divine essence (shén)** moves, all **divine essences** respond.\nThe **southeast (Xùn)** direction is not where thunder is summoned—\nUsing it would merely waste your **spiritual vitality**.\n\nYet this **one aperture**—\nFormless, shapeless,\nNeither before nor after,\nNeither long nor short,\nBeyond measure of width or narrowness,\nBeyond distinction of east, west, south, or north—\nResides precisely at the **Heaven-Earth’s intersection**,\nWhere **Yin** and **Yang** blend in unity.\nEven **ghosts and gods** cannot fathom its mysteries.\n\nAlas, **later learners** fail to grasp this truth,\nInstead fixating on the **rotten corpse’s fleshly orifices**,\nFocusing on the **elixir field (Dāntián)**,\nOr obsessing between the **two kidneys**.\nSome channel *Qi* beneath the **navel (qíxià)**,\nOthers gaze at the **muddy pellet (Níhuán)**,\nLost in **frantic speculation**—\nBelieving this to be **enlightenment**.\n\nTo speak of **one aperture** is how distant you are!\nThus it was said before:\n*\"Wind and clouds, thunder and rain hide in the One,\nYet most fail to recognize this aperture’s law.\nThe Dragon’s ranks scatter with stripping and clashing,\nMetal winds and Metal rains crash in thunderbolts.\nIf one can observe Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,\nAnd grasp Heaven’s **actions (xíng)**,\nThen self-knowledge is attained.\"*\n\nWhen **Yin** and **Yang** are misaligned,\nAnd *Qi*’s rhythms disrupt their order—\nEither **Yang** overpowers **Yin**, bringing scorching drought,\nOr **Yin** overpowers **Yang**, causing floods to rise—\nThe key lies in **summoning thunder**:\nBalancing **Yin** and **Yang** to flow smoothly,\nDirecting **creation’s transformations (Zàohuà)** to circulate freely.\nTurning the Dipper’s handle,\nCalling thunder and rain to save the **parched and withered**;\nReversing the **Heavenly Aperture (Tiānguān)**,\nRousing **wind and thunder** to sweep away **Yin’s obscurations**.\n\nYet today’s scholars are scattered,\nMost lacking **true teachers** to guide them.\nThey rely on **rumors and hearsay (dàotīngtúshuō)**,\nStealing scraps of **law and method (lòufǎ)**.\nThey do not seek the **ultimate treasure within their hearts**,\nBut only chase the **mysterious script on paper**.\n\nDiscussing **mysteries**, boasting of **wonders**,\nPraising themselves while belittling others.\nTheir words are **pure**, yet their deeds are **filthy**,\nIgnoring **Heaven’s decrees**—\nThus **Three Officials** strike their **tablets**,\n**Five Emperors** list their **grievances**,\nAnd after their **bodies perish**, their **souls fall into Yīndū**,\nSuffering endless torments.\nAh!

Should one not fear it?\n\n**Later learners**, take heed and strive anew.\n\nOn the **First Day of the First Month of Jiǎwǔ in Zhìyuán (至元甲午上元日)**,\nA **later learner from Sōngjiāng (松江)**, **Thunder’s Scattering Official (Léitíng Sǎnlì)**, **Jǐngyáng Wěiyīn (景阳王惟一)**, recorded this.\n\nI, a humble fool,\nDabbled in **Daoist methods**,\nOnce encountered a **true master** who taught me,\nAnd I came to know a few of the **law’s secrets**.\nI reflected on the **ancestral teachers’ words**:\n*\"The law moves through Pre-Heaven’s single *Qi*,\nAnd must be wielded by your own **original spirit (yuánshén)**.\"*\nThis is a **direct pointing to the profound**, enlightening **later learners**.\n\nYet scholars with shallow insight,\nUnable to awaken to its truth,\nInstead fixate on **visualizing and imagining**—\nTaking it as **mystery**.\n\nLittle did they know—\n**Forsaking the root for the branch**,\n**Abandoning truth for illusion**!\n\nI too once failed to grasp this principle,\nAnd sought only the **written teachings of enlightened masters**.\nSome would **chant the \"sob\" (tí) sound**,\nSwallowing it into the **elixir field (Dāntián)**,\nThen **draw forth the \"mocking\" (cháo) sound**,\nImagining **golden light**—\nThis was their way of **Pre-Heaven’s single *Qi***.\n\nOthers would **harbor the spirit of Fire**,\n**Store the essence of Water**,\nAnd **intercourse at the Primordial Sea (Yuánhǎi)**,\nForming a **baby**, believing it their **original spirit**.\n\nI did not follow such paths,\nBut through **painstaking effort**,\nFortunately met a **true teacher**,\nWho revealed the **one aperture of thunder**,\nExplaining these **principles**—\nAwakening me from my **drunken haze**, dispelling all previous errors.\n\nLater, I received **Master Yuèdǐng Mò’s** **messenger’s method**,\nAnd he expounded on the **Pre-Heaven’s mysteries**.\nHe said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** speaks of the space between Heaven and Earth—\nLike a **bagpipe’s bellows (tuóqiào)**—\nEmpty yet never collapsing,\nStirred yet ever more abundant.\"*",

world,\nBut find no true listener to converse with—\nThus I compose these **illustrations**,\nNaming them *\"**Subtle Dao/Way Precepts** (Dàofǎ Jīngwēi).\"*\n\n**Illustration of Observing the Dao/Way Precepts:**\nTo **uphold the Dao/Way Precepts** (Xíngchí dàofǎ) is to begin and end with **one steadfast principle** (Rùnběi yīzhǐ),\nAnd thus attain **transcendence** (Xiān).\nFor those who practice the **Dao/Way Precepts**,\nThey must first **receive and uphold the Ten Precepts** (Shíjiè).\nIn daily life, they must never falter.\nIf they further **alleviate greed and rescue suffering**,\nAnd **accumulate merit through righteous actions** (Jīgōng lěixíng),\nThey will naturally move Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Gods** will be reverent,\n**Demons** will submit,\nAnd they will command **Thunder Dao** (Léishén) to serve them—\nSummoning winds and calling rains.\n\nYet there are some later disciples,\nWho do not **uphold the precepts** (Chí lǜ),\nNor **discern right from wrong** (Biàn yézhèng),\nBut cling to words and symbols,\nConcocting wild and chaotic thoughts.\nIf they experience a fleeting moment of inspiration,\nThey already deem themselves satisfied.\nThey do not investigate the **ultimate source of that inspiration**,\nAnd thus **invite evil by their deeds**,\n**Summon demons by their actions**.\n\nHence, **Master Sàzhēn** said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way Precepts** are not trifling—\nReflect on **upholding the precepts** and it will chill your heart.\nEasier than a thousand-year iron tree blooming,\nHarder than entering **Dàochéng** (邓都) to manifest in the world.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"If your words are pure yet your actions are foul, do not speak of the **Dao/Way**,\nFor those who disregard the **Precepts of Heaven** (Tiāntiáo) merely engage in empty rituals.\"*\n\n**Master Bǎoyī** was asked:\n*\"How does one **subdue evil** (Zhì yé)?\"\nHe replied:\n*\"Cultivate yourself to become upright (Xiū jǐ yǐ zhèng).\nIf you do not hear of the **deceitful

transformations are endless,\nYet it has no fixed moment.\n\nThus the **Sages** taught:\n*\"To cultivate the heart is to cultivate the **Dao/Way**,\nTo cultivate the **Dao/Way** is to cultivate the heart.\"*\n\n**Mencius** said:\n*\"Nurturing the heart is best done by **restraining desires** (Shǎo yù).\"*\n\n**Emperor Yáo** declared:\n*\"Heaven divides creation into **one central principle** (Yīzhōng),\nHumans weave their **patterns of life** (Jīnglún) from the heart.\"*\n\n**Master Xūqìng Tiānshī** taught:\n*\"When a single thought stirs within,\nThe **six senses** (Liùshí) flow

**Original Spirit** (Yuánshén) may dwell there.\nIf you retain anything within it,\nYour entire life will be **impure**.\"*\n\n**Master Bǎoyī** stated:\n*\"If a method comes from the same **Dao/Way

all the incantations?\nThey belong to **Post-Heaven** as soon as one begins to move.\nTalismans, diagrams, seals, and formulas—\nThese are but the **end** of things.\nMy *Heart-Transmitted Record*
