  "full_translation": "*The Supreme Cavernous Abyss Sutra on Invoking the Dragon Kings for Rain*\n\nSutra Title: *The Supreme Cavernous Abyss Sutra on Invoking the Dragon Kings for Rain*. Author unknown. Five sutras bound in one volume. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Dongxuan Section, Category of Original Texts.\n\n---\n\n*The Supreme Cavernous Abyss Sutra on Invoking the Dragon Kings for Rain*\n\nLong ago, the Dao Lord gazed upon the world from the Three Heavens above. He beheld the myriad heavens and earths, where pestilential qi spread unchecked, and the people suffered from manifold illnesses. The lands were scorched by drought, and the five grains withered. In twos and threes, none knew what to do.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy descended upon the land, riding upon clouds of five colors. Manifesting divine transformations, he revealed radiant light. Accompanied by the dragon kings of the heavens, jade maidens, and immortal youths—seven thousand two hundred in all—he proclaimed the true Dharma, universally delivering all beings. A great torrent poured forth, and in that very moment, sweet moisture descended.\n\nLet none among you harbor doubt, lest calamity befall your nine generations of ancestors, their suffering souls bound in the offices of the ghostly bureaucracy. For a hundred kalpas and a thousand rebirths, they shall know no escape. But if you diligently receive, uphold, recite, and practice this sutra, its merit shall run deep and far. The people shall be free from disaster, each extending their years in longevity, untouched by harm.\n\nThe Dao declared: Should a nation face peril—when weapons clash and the people turn to devouring one another, when heaven and earth tremble and the sun and moon lose their luster—let that land, in the direction of its blessed virtue, within its palace gardens or where springs and pools reside, establish the stations of the Nine Dragons and erect the forms of the Five Sages. Recite this sutra, pay homage to the August Emperor of the Void Heavens and the Heavenly Dragons who guard the realm. Then shall demonic vapors vanish of themselves, warfare cease, rulers and ministers follow the Dao, and dragon virtue lend its support. The world shall know great peace, and the throne shall endure in prosperity.\n\nUpon hearing this exposition, the assembled immortals and all present received benefit, their spirits universally nourished. Rising as one, they paid reverence, each vowing to receive and uphold *The Supreme Cavernous Abyss’s Subtle and Supreme Invocation of the Heavenly Dragon Kings*.\n\nThe Dragon King of the Azure Emperor of the East.\nThe Dragon King of the Vermilion Emperor of the South.\n\nThe Dragon King of the White Emperor of the West.\nThe Dragon King of the Black Emperor of the North.\nThe Dragon King of the Yellow Emperor of the Center.\nThe Dragon King of the Sun and Moon.\nThe Dragon King of the Constellations.\nThe Dragon King of the Heavenly Officials.\nThe Dragon King of the Dragon Palaces.\nThe Dragon Lord of the Heavenly Gates.\nThe Dragon King of Yama.\nThe Dragon King of Hell.\nThe Dragon King of Heavenly Virtue.\nThe Dragon King of Earthly Virtue.\nThe Dragon King of Heavenly Beings.\nThe Dragon King of Flying Beings.\nThe Lotus Dragon King.\nThe Flower Grove Dragon King.\nThe Dragon Kings of the Five Sacred Peaks.\nThe Dragon Kings of Mountains and Rivers.\nAdditionally:\nThe Dragon King Who Slays Demons.\nThe Dragon King of *Kaluohe* Demons.\nThe Lesser Auspicious Dragon King.\nThe Golden Radiance Dragon King.\nThe Golden-Hued Dragon King.\nThe Dragon King of Yang Qi.\nThe Dragon King of Yin Qi.\nThe Dragon King of Medicine.\nThe Lion Dragon King.\nThe Dragon King Who Guards the Realm.\nThe Dragon King Who Guards the Homestead.\nThe Dragon King of Wealth.\nThe Dragon King of Wells and Hearths.\nThe Dragon King of Gold and Silver.\nThe Dragon King of Treasures.\nThe Dragon King of Storehouses.\nThe Dragon King of Prosperity.\nThe Dragon King of the Five Ridges.\nThe Dragon King of the Five Grains.\nThe Golden-Headed Dragon King.\nThe Dragon King of Clothing and Sustenance.\nThe Dragon King of Official Rank.\nThe Dragon King of Official Emolument.\nThe Dragon King of Rivers and Seas.\nThe Dragon King of Cloud Seas.\nThe Dragon King of the Huai Sea.\nThe Dragon King of Mountains and Seas.\nThe Dragon King of Abyssal Seas.\nThe Dragon King of Lands.\nThe Dragon King of Prefectures and Counties.\nThe Dragon King of Cities.\nThe Dragon King of Sacred Altars.\nThe Dragon King of the Wind Earl.\nThe Dragon King of Tremors.\nThe Dragon King of Thunder and Rain.\nThe Dragon King of Great Rain.\nThe Dragon King Who Scatters Water.\nThe Dragon King of Heavenly Rain.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Proclaim to all sentient beings, those who recite *The Sutra of the Divine Incantations of the Heavenly Dragon Kings* as I have expounded shall, for three days and three nights, burn incense and invoke the names, universally summoning the Heavenly Dragons. In times of drought, rain shall fall. Though thunder and lightning arise, no harm shall come. When these dragons descend, they shall fulfill every wish. Whether seeking virtue, longevity, official rank for sons and daughters, healing for the people’s illnesses, protection for dwellings from misfortune, resolution of all grievances and legal matters—none shall fail to prosper. Should demon kings or malevolent spirits hear this sutra and refuse to depart, their heads shall shatter into seven pieces, their roots severed utterly. What this sutra subdues shall be subdued; what it averts shall be averted.\n\nShould any land, city, or village suffer frequent conflagrations from heavenly fire, let every household first inscribe the names of the Four Seas’ Dragon Kings and place them at the four corners of their dwellings. Then, burning incense and upholding the sutra, the Water Dragons shall come to guard. The Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, the Dragon King of the Southern Sea, the Dragon King of the Western Sea, and the Dragon King of the Northern Sea—each shall rise into the void, manifesting divine transformations. In an instant, they shall spew forth ten thousand measures of water. The fire spirits, upon witnessing this, shall burrow a thousand feet into the earth. Moreover, the Great Water Dragon King, who governs the center, shall guard and stabilize each direction, sweeping away all inauspiciousness.\n\nThe Dao speaks: If devout men and women venerate the Dragon Kings in their homes, inscribe their names, and place them in the dwelling or storehouse, offering pure water and fresh fruits in timely devotion—especially on the first and fifteenth days of the month, the days of dragon worship—reciting the sutra and invoking the Dragon Kings, their households shall prosper, free from loss, their storehouses overflowing. The efficacy of this sutra is beyond measure.\n\nAt that moment, the four assemblies, upon hearing this exposition, rejoiced immeasurably. Eighty-four thousand Dragon Kings leapt forth as one, shaking heaven and earth. Dragons and spirits gathered in assembly, and a great deluge of rain poured forth, universally saving all beings. All heavenly beings simultaneously rejoiced, bowing their heads in reverence and vowing to uphold it. Thus concludes *The Supreme Cavernous Abyss’s Sutra of Invoking the Dragon Kings for Rain*.",
