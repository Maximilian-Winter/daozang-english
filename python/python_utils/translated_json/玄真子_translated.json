  "full_translation": "The Imperial *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Section on Masters, Volume 14* – Descriptive Catalogue\n\n*Xuanzhenzi*\n**Daoist School**\n\n**[Appendix] Tianyinzi**\n**Daoist School**\n\n**[Your servants]** respectfully note: *Xuanzhenzi* comprises one fascicle, authored by Zhang Zhihe of the Tang. Zhihe, styled Zitong, was a native of Wuzhou. Originally named Fuling, he passed the *mingjing* examinations during the reign of Emperor Suzong and was appointed to the Hanlin Academy. Later, due to an offense, he was demoted to the post of magistrate of Nanpu. After receiving amnesty, he returned but chose to wander rivers and lakes for the rest of his life, styling himself the \"Fisherman of Misty Waves\" and also the \"Master of Mystic Perfection.\" His biography is recorded in the *New Tang History* under the *Biographies of Recluses*, and Shen Fen’s *Continuation of the Biographies of Immortals* recounts his deeds in fantastical detail. Most of these accounts appear to be embellishments by enthusiasts; in truth, he was merely a man of serene retreat and self-preservation. According to the *Book Catalogue with Explanations*, his work originally consisted of twelve fascicles. By the time of Chen Zhensun, only three fascicles remained, and even these were incomplete. The present edition contains only three chapters—\"Azure Void,\" \"The Phoenix,\" and \"The Spirit of Waves\"—bound as one fascicle, differing from Chen’s description. Perhaps in the original, each chapter was treated as a separate fascicle. His writings vaguely resemble the *Outer Chapters* of the *Baopuzi*, though they lack its ornate elegance.\n\n*Tianyinzi* was also written by a Tang author, though his name is unknown. A preface by Sima Chengzhen suggests he was a contemporary of Empress Wu Zetian. Both Chao Gongwu and Chen Zhensun suspected the work was falsely attributed to Chengzhen. However, Chengzhen had already established his reputation with his own *Zuowanglun* (*On Sitting in Forgetfulness*), so why would he lend his name to this text?\n\nThe book consists of eight chapters: \"Divine Immortals,\" \"Simplicity and Ease,\" \"The Gradual Gate,\" \"Fasting and Abstinence,\" \"Tranquil Dwelling,\" \"Visualization,\" \"Sitting in Forgetfulness,\" and \"Spiritual Liberation.\" The *Record of Reading Books* mentions an edition with *The Three Palaces Method* appended, but this version omits it—likely lost in transmission.\n\nThe text is brief, spanning only a few pages, insufficient to form an independent fascicle. Given its contemporaneity with *Xuanzhenzi*, it is here appended to that work, following its classification.\n\n*Wunengzi*\n**Daoist School**\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: *Wunengzi* comprises three fascicles, with no author’s name recorded. The preface states it was written in the third year of Guangqi (887), when the Son of Heaven resided in Baoji—thus, its author was a contemporary of Emperor Xizong of Tang. The *Comprehensive Catalog of Chongwen* of the Song dynasty classifies it under the Daoist School. Chao Gongwu’s *Record of Reading Books* states the text contains thirty chapters expounding the natural principles of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Upon examination, however, the table of contents lists thirty-four chapters, matching the number cited in the preface. Yet in the first fascicle, the sixth chapter is noted as missing; in the second, the fifth; and in the third, six chapters—the seventh, ninth, tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth—are likewise absent. Thus, the complete work must have contained more than thirty-four chapters. Could it be that at the time, the text existed in name only, with chapters planned but never composed, their titles left vacant?\n\nThe book extensively borrows from the principles of Zhuangzi and Liezi, interspersed with Buddhist doctrines. Its language is rather shallow, yet as a surviving Tang work, it is now rare. We therefore include it in its original form, retaining its classification under the Daoist School.\n\nRespectfully submitted in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.\n\n**Chief Compilers:**\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collator:**\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n---\n\n**Original Preface to *Xuanzhenzi***\n\n*Xuanzhenzi* is the work of Zhang Zhihe of the Tang dynasty. Zhihe, styled Zitong, was a native of Wuzhou. His father, well-versed in the books of Zhuangzi and Liezi, composed the *Xiangwang* and *Baimai* chapters to support his teachings. Zhihe, originally named Ling, passed the *mingjing* examination at sixteen and presented a memorial to Emperor Suzong, who was so impressed that he summoned him to the Hanlin Academy and bestowed upon him his new name. Later, Zhihe was demoted to the post of magistrate of Nanpu due to a minor offense. After his pardon, he declined to return to office upon his parents’ deaths, dwelling instead among rivers and lakes. He styled himself the \"Fisherman of Mist and Waves\" and composed this book in three fascicles. Its prose flows freely and boldly, closely resembling the style of Zhuangzi and Liezi—truly the work of an extraordinary scholar. Li Deyu once praised him, saying he was \"reclusive yet renowned, illustrious yet unburdened by affairs, neither impoverished nor prosperous, the equal of Yan Guang.\"\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n\n*The Blue Void*\nBy Zhang Zhihe of the Tang\n\nThe Azure Void—its vastness turns the wheel within the abyssal depths, drifts upon the crimson earth, and encircles the celestial thoroughfares. The Well ascends as scorching flame, the Dipper descends as bitter cold; thus the four seasons revolve and the myriad things transform—this is but the secondary work of creation. Yet is it not the primordial origin of creation?\n\nThe Boundless is the sovereign of discourse. The Bound says: The Emperor of the Yellow Wilds is called *Zhibei*; the Emperor of the Purple Walls is called *Shenzun*; the Emperor of the Azure Void is called *Lingyou*. *Zhibei* reigns over the earth, to whom mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees belong. *Shenzun* reigns over the heavens, to whom the sun, moon, stars, and Milky Way belong. *Lingyou* reigns over the void, to whom wind, thunder, clouds, and rain belong.\n\nThe Azure Void, harmonizing the two Emperors, has its domain. In an instant, *Zhibei* ascends while *Shenzun* descends, meeting in the wilds of *Lingyou*. The Emperor of *Lingyou*, holding an empty position, welcomes them with all the realm’s abundance: piled meat becomes rosy clouds, fermented wine turns to rain, lightning races, thunder gallops, wind sings, and clouds dance. For months, *Lingyou* serves as the mediator of the middle way. Above and below, none harbor resentment; the two Emperors rejoice, humbled by *Lingyou*’s profound virtue. They command the Azure Void to cease its contention and yield the throne to extend *Lingyou*’s reign.\n\n*Shenzun* says: “I possess the heavens.”\n*Zhibei* says: “I possess the earth.”\n*Lingyou*, perplexed by the names “heaven” and “earth,” asks: “When I gaze upward, it is no different from the Azure Void; when I look downward, it is no different from the Azure Void. What else lies beyond the Azure Void?”\n\nThe Emperors speak of heaven and earth—what are their forms?\n\n*Zhibei* says: “My earth is vast in substance, thick in mass, the source of all life. Its center rises, its edges descend, its form layered like the earth’s strata, resembling an altar. All things are honored within its bounds: the eight directions encircled by seas, the nine mountains framed by bones of rock. Its flesh is soil, its veins are springs, its sweat is mist, its breath is vapor. Rivers and streams rush chaotically; humans, insects, birds, and beasts wander in profusion. I invite the Emperor to wander below.”\n\n*Shenzun* says: “My heaven is hollow in form, lofty in stature, the origin of all transformations. Its center is round, its edges revolve, its motion like the canopy of the celestial vault. All things are honored within: the five planets traverse, the constellations array in splendor, the sun and moon course along, and the Milky Way stretches across. Mists disperse, clouds and rosy dawns gather, immortals dwell in celestial palaces. I invite the Emperor to reside above.”\n\n*Lingyou* does not believe them: “If heaven is like a canopy, how is it suspended above? If earth is like an altar, what lies beneath it? How can it be stable?”\n\n*Shenzun* says: “The canopy of heaven is not suspended above; the drifting wheel bears it from below, ever revolving to the left, while the three luminaries follow it westward.”\n\n*Zhibei* says: “The altar of earth has abyssal depths that congeal and float above it—this is how it remains stable.”\n\n*Lingyou* asks: “The drifting wheel turns, giving life to the abyssal depths—what contains them? I wish to hear of this.”\n\n*Zhibei* says: “The drifting wheel pervades below; the abyssal depths rest upon it. Why doubt this?”\n\n*Lingyou* sighs: “Ah! The forms of heaven and earth, the workings of creation—truly, they are as you have described. I shall rest content. My void is an expanse of boundless vastness, equally empty and all-pervading, without inside or outside, without west or east. Vast and limitless, it embraces the azure clarity, contains the light of the sun and moon, resounds with the thunder’s roar, displays the hues of rainbows, and bears the forms of dragons and simurghs. Seated, I wander through it; reclining, I float upon it. Drifting freely, I may alight anywhere—spacious, all-encompassing, boundless, and open!”\n\nFirm and enduring—longevity is not born of spring and summer, nor does it decay through the passage of years. Before heaven and earth, its beginning remains unseen; after heaven and earth, its end cannot be known. If this is so, how could my eternal vastness be cast aside, or your fleeting moment be entrusted to me?\n\nThereupon, the Two Emperors withdrew, heeding *Lingyou*’s words, and returned to their former abode. *Zhibei* descended to the yellow wilds, while the divine lord ascended to the purple expanse. For months, the world remained unsettled, and heaven and earth sealed themselves in silence.\n\n*Hongxiazi* asked *Bixuzi*: “The origin of creation, the source of the natural—what is their true form? I long to wander within your realm and behold it. Might I hear of this?”\n\nThereupon, *Bixuzi* paused in profound stillness, then suddenly brightened, his countenance clearing as he intoned:\n\nAbove the Great Vastness, a song of the Hollow Void—\nIt is called:\n*Without self-so, the self-so’s source;\nWithout creation, the creation’s origin.*\n\nVast and unadorned, its form opens and closes.\nGaze upon it—your sight is severed;\nPonder it—your thoughts are cut off.\nThus may you observe.\n\n*Hongxiazi* said: “If this is so, then I shall swiftly soar and fleetingly wander. Pray, let me ride upon this and roam without restraint, that I may behold it without delay.”\n\nThereupon, *Bixuzi* guided him, saying:\n*Without self-so—this is called the Profound;\nWithout creation—this is called the True Transformation of the Profound.*\n\nOf the True—\n*Without Profound yet Profound—this is called True Profundity;\nWithout True yet True—this is called Profound Truth.*\n\nHe expounded further:\n*Without ‘so’—is there unity in its ‘so’?\nOnly then may you observe the natural.\nWithout transformation—is there unity in its transformation?\nOnly then may you observe creation.\nWithout Profundity—is there unity in its Profundity?\nOnly then may you observe the True Profundity.\nWithout Truth—is there unity in its Truth?\nOnly then may you observe the Profound Truth.*\n\n*Yiyan* spoke freely:\n*Truly True! Profoundly Profound! Profound Truth!*\n*Profound Truth—freely spoken!*\n\nWithout Truth—is there Truth? Truly, truly, truly so!\nWithout Profundity—is there Profundity? Profoundly, profoundly—\nOnly then may one ascend the Heaven of Great Vastness.\n\nThat which is \"without being\" is the origin of being and non-being;\nThat which is \"being and non-being\" is the inception of \"without being.\"\nWhen \"without being\" gives rise to being, and non-being is established, creation unfolds within it.\n\nNow, the arising of creation:\nEmptiness pervades it,\nWind moves it,\nWater gathers it,\nPerception senses it,\nQi flows through it—\nAnd the ten thousand things are complete within it.\n\nEmptiness pervades, and thus form abides;\nWind moves, and thus function arises;\nWater gathers, and thus visibility emerges;\nPerception senses, and thus thought is born;\nQi flows, and thus intent is established.\n\nForm abides, and thus the root may be deepened;\nFunction arises, and thus gradualness may be illuminated;\nVisibility emerges, and thus change may be observed;\nThought is born, and thus transformation may be known;\nIntent is established, and thus principle may be discerned.\n\nThus, the root that may be deepened is the form of Emptiness;\nThe gradualness that may be illuminated is the function of Wind;\nThe change that may be observed is the visibility of Water;\nThe transformation that may be known is the thought of Perception;\nThe principle that may be discerned is the intent of Qi.\n\nTherefore, Wind and Water vie in change, and things differ in their forms;\nPerception and Qi multiply in intent, and thoughts vary in their singularity.\nRevolving in Qian, yet ever constant;\nFloating in Kun, yet ever enduring.\nIts motion is boundless, its generation directionless,\nIts transformation edgeless, its causation limitless.\n\nTracing its origin—what may it be called?\nDoes it reside in the abiding of creation and transformation?\nIn the primal vastness that reaches its extremity?\nIn the self-so of \"without self\"?\nIn the abiding of emptiness and nothingness?\n\nSubtly observe where it abides, and the origin of creation may be seen.\n\n*Hongxiazi* understood the realm of creation,\nYet feared the color of repeated emptiness.\nThereupon, he draped himself in the light of Red Yang,\nNourished his form with the qi of Azure Vastness,\nSevered the rites of celebration and mourning,\nDiminished the inquiries of kin and friends,\nAnd roamed alone with the Great Void.\nWinds attended his high ramparts,\nMoonlight illumined his gate through the night,\nAnd his solitary discourse never ceased.\n\nThose who savored worldly delights and prized nobility heard of him and came.\nBeholding his empty lane and desolate hut, their hearts could not bear the sorrow,\nAnd they reproached him, saying:\n*\"I have no leisure to attend to myself—how could I concern myself with creation?\"*\n\n*Hongxiazi* replied:\n*\"I am creation’s confidant—there is nothing it does not disclose to me.\nYet creation alone does not know me, and thus I lack for nothing.\nI bear no shame before creation; creation bears shame before me.\nI shall go and reproach it, to console your sorrow and wash away your shame.\"*\n\nThereupon, he harnessed the steed of Red Yang,\nMounted the chariot of Azure Vastness,\nBrushed his robes, and turned eastward.\nPassing through the Land of Nothingness, he encountered *Tongkong*,\nFrom whom he sought passage.\n\n*Tongkong* asked:\n*\"Who are you, and why have you come?\"*\nHe replied:\n*\"I am Hongxiazi. I go to reproach creation. I beg passage through your land.\"*\n\n*Tongkong* questioned him:\n*\"Who is this ‘creation’? What do you mean by ‘seeking passage’?\"*\n*Hongxiazi* said:\n*\"The master of things is called creation. To traverse your land is called seeking passage.\"*\n\n*Tongkong* replied:\n*\"If that is so, then in my eastern lands, nothing may be created;\nIn my realm, no Dao may be traversed.\nYou must change your path.\"*\n\nThereupon, *Hongxiazi* brushed his robes and sped southward.\nPassing through the Domain of the Natural, he encountered *Huayuan*,\nFrom whom he sought passage.\n\n*Huayuan* asked:\n*\"Who are you, and why have you come?\"*\nHe replied:\n*\"I am Hongxiazi. I go to reproach creation. I beg passage through your land.\"*\n\n*Huayuan* interrogated him:\n*\"Creation is the neighbor of my brother’s land—have you not heard?\nTo seek passage through my land is to reproach my kin.\nYou are my enemy.\"*\n\nHongxiazi and his disciple prepared to attack, whereupon he brushed his robes and sped westward. Passing through the Domain of No-Dwelling, he encountered *Yinben*, from whom he sought passage.\n\n*Yinben* asked:\n*\"Who are you, and why have you come?\"*\nHe replied:\n*\"I am Hongxiazi. I go to reproach creation. I beg passage through your land.\"*\n\n*Yinben* refused him, saying:\n*\"Have you not heard of the price of seeking passage? You possess a chariot that soars through empty space and a jade disk that illumines the void—I shall open the gates for you.\"*\nHongxiazi said:\n*\"If I possessed such jade and chariot, would I reproach creation or seek passage from you?\"*\n\nThereupon, he brushed his robes and hastened northward. Passing through the Wilds of the Supreme Ultimate, he encountered *Shengshou*, from whom he sought passage.\n\n*Shengshou* rebuked him:\n*\"Why have you come to know so late? Creation may be known but never neighbored, heard but never befriended. Though you seek passage through my land, how shall you reach it? To reproach it—is this not impossible?\"*\n\nUpon hearing *Shengshou*’s rebuke, Hongxiazi stood stunned. Guardedly, he hesitated, turned his reins, and wheeled his chariot about. Passing through the outskirts of the Mystic Plain, he lost his way upon the herdsman’s path. His spirit was as changeable as the waters of the Mystic River, and so he wandered, seeking guidance.\n\nTwo boys asked:\n*\"Master, what clan do you belong to? You tread the void, brave the mist and clouds, and your chariot and horses weary of traversing empty space—where do you go to seek guidance?\"*\nHongxiazi replied:\n*\"I am Hongxiazi. I once knew creation, yet creation knows me not. It has left me bereft of the means to sustain myself, a disgrace among the vulgar. I go to reproach creation. I turned east, drove west, sped south, and hastened north, seeking passage from the four directions. In the east, I reached the Realm of Nothingness, where *Tongkong* questioned me; in the south, the Domain of the Natural, where *Huayuan* refused me; in the west, the Domain of No-Dwelling, where *Yinben* denied me; in the north, the Wilds of the Supreme Ultimate, where *Shengshou* rebuked me. I thought the day grows late and the road distant—I shall turn my chariot homeward. Yet here, within the world, I am lost at this ford. Fortunate indeed to meet you—I dare to ask for guidance.\"*\n\nYet who are you?\" Hongxiazi marveled, \"How magnificent your words!\"\n\nThe two lads replied: \"We speak of the spirit and the mutable. We herd the Dao alongside creation in the celestial wilds. We had just played the Six Passes' game, and both lost our Way. Fearing creation's reproach, we hesitated and lingered, bathing in the celestial plains. Moreover, burdened by our Dao-laden cares, how could we dare face creation? Yet you, sir, bring worldly shame to our lord—though you bear the questions of feudal lords, do not harbor even a single thought of offending creation. How could we again show our swimming and drifting upon these celestial plains? You have left the mortal realm, yet never beheld creation, lost at the ford and asking the way. If you lose your old home, with what face shall you meet the elders and brothers of the world? Why not disrobe and bathe here, swimming together, riding the waves, drifting with the currents, and roaming freely? Await the completion of our white plan, then we shall approach you and present you to creation—would that not bring you clarity?\"\n\nThereupon, Hongxiazi flushed with light, sinking and rising with the reflections, ascending the rapids, guarding against the waves. With the two lads, he rode the surging celestial tides, drifting beyond the six directions. In an instant, they reached creation's realm. The Natural offered constant garments; the Supreme Ultimate advanced the Infinite as food. Radiant, they filled creation's domain. Hongxiazi and the two lads donned and feasted upon the luminous glory, illuminating the six directions within. Then they prostrated before the True of Transformation, who turned and gazed upon the mortal world. Ashamed, Hongxiazi saw the glory and shame of the vulgar as illusory. He feared only that creation would know of his intended reproach.\n\nThereupon, creation questioned the two lads about the Dao's whereabouts. The lads replied: \"Nothing is lost, yet nothing is not lost. The Dao does not depart from the imperial homeland.\" Creation rejoiced, saying: \"That which has no being is not lost; that which is lost has no being. That which is not possessed is not lost; that which is not lost is not possessed. Release it to the celestial plains' outskirts, boundless—then the lads have found the method to herd the Dao.\"\n\nThereupon, Hongxiazi was filled with the garments of the Natural and sated with the food of the Supreme Ultimate. Delighted by creation's words and bearing creation's power, he bowed to creation and, with the two lads, turned and withdrew, intending to return to his old home. On this journey, he encountered the Void of Sameness in the Realm of Nothingness. The Void of Sameness said: \"Since you beheld creation, I have sought you, left your home, and dwelt in desolate solitude, thinking of you in the mortal world—are you well?\" Hongxiazi replied: \"I have but faced creation, received its countenance, and heard its heart. Creation's words made me know the supreme Dao's non-being. How could I see the being or non-being of the mortal world? The origin of transformation is the source. From being, observe its non-being; from non-being, observe its being. How can one describe this? Countenance is but the guarding of its numinous spirit.\"\n\nVast and boundless is its primordial state—thus it is said: the guarding of the numinous essence is hard to fathom, and the boundless primordial is hard to detail. The myriad forms are inexhaustible, the myriad minds are without fixed direction. Therefore, those of old who ascended the Great Vastness to observe the origin of transformation knew its workings to be ceaseless.\n\nThey composed the *Song of the Great Vastness*, saying:\n*\"Origin of transformation—how numinous!\nAzure Void—how clear!\nCrimson Radiance—how bright!\nGuarding—how vast!\nBoundless—how indistinct!\nOnly the work of transformation is without limit!\"*\n\nWere one not to unify the distinctions of the myriad forms and the oneness of the myriad forms, nor harmonize the differences of the myriad minds and the singularity of the myriad minds—without thought, reaching the very threshold of guarding and boundlessness—how then could one wander through the Great Nothingness to observe the non-being of creation?\n\nThe *Yuyu* and the *YuYu* Clan came from the East; the *Suanni* Clan arrived from the Western Regions. They met in the wilds of the Central Lands and engaged in a contest of emptiness, battling with sounds to determine victory or defeat. Thereupon, the *Yuyu* Clan trilled like a bird, saying:\n\n*\"I have heard of sighs and exclamations, of scolding and hissing, of sighing and gasping—ah! The qi that is gulped, sipped, slurped, and sucked—spicy, sour, sweet, and bland—how they are tasted! Side glances and debates, squints and stares, sharp and piercing gazes—ah! The pupils that clatter, the reins that are pulled, the shields that are raised, the clangs and clatters, the guards and drums—how keen the hearing!\"*\n\nAt this, the *Suanni* Clan roared in response, saying:\n\n*\"I have heard of the sun and the moon, of comets and shooting stars—how radiant and bright they wheel! The peaks of heaven, the ridges, hills, and crags—how towering and jagged, how layered and steep! The surging tides, the waves, the overflows, the whirlpools—how roaring and vast, how billowing and sweeping! The sprites and demons, the goblins and specters—how they flicker and vanish, how they startle and disappear—ah! How extreme!\"*\n\nThey declared, *\"Our exchange has exhausted all words, our speech flows like a ceaseless spring—we have reached the limit!\"* Yet the *Yuyu* Clan sharpened its talons, whetted its beak, and played with its tongue, while the *Suanni* Clan bristled its fur, lashed its tail, and roared with its throat. The Master of the Central Lands sighed, saying:\n\n*\"If we speak of the body, the *Yuyu* Clan’s discourse is near; if we speak of things, the *Suanni* Clan’s discourse is far. These two lords have turned their backs on the silent realm, exhausting themselves in a battle of sounds. Though their flashing eyes blaze like lightning and their clamoring tongues thunder, they merely startle the birds of prey in the deep valleys—how could they echo the Dao in the vast ocean?\"*\n\nThe Great Vastness asked Boundless: *\"In the midst of creation, the ten thousand images are not one—can one seek the ultimate of small and large, being and non-being, and speak of it?\"*\n\nBoundless replied: *\"From my observation, the smallest becomes large, and the largest becomes small; the most non-existent becomes existent, and the most existent becomes non-existent. Do you understand this?\"*\n\nThe Great Vastness said: *\"From what I have heard, the smallest cannot be made large, the largest cannot be made small; the most non-existent cannot be made existent, and the most existent cannot be made non-existent. What do you mean by this?\"*\n\nBoundless said: *\"Let me tell you: in the realm of the smallest and largest, nothing surpasses emptiness; in the realm of the most non-existent and most existent, nothing surpasses the Dao. Why is this so? The Dao encompasses heaven and earth, and even what lies beyond being—is this not the ultimate greatness of emptiness? Yet when it divides and fills the tiniest speck of dust, does it not become the ultimate smallness of emptiness? When one traverses the six directions and finds nothing, is this not the ultimate non-being of the Dao? When one emerges from creation and cannot escape it, is this not the ultimate being of the Dao? Thus it is said: the smallest becomes large, the largest becomes small; the most non-existent becomes existent, and the most existent becomes non-existent—is this not also so?\"*\n\nAt the dawn of creation, the Nine Great Powers contended. The wind howled and wailed—*fang-fang*, *xiu-xiu*—and *fang-fang* once more.\n\nThe winds howl and roar—*liu-liu*—fanning the primordial chaos into a whirl of *liao-fang*, drumming and clashing with mournful cries—*fang-fang*—uprooting stones and trees, churning waves into surging torrents. Who could be greater than this? Is not my greatness thus?\n\nAnd the clouds’ qi surges forth—*xi-hu*, *hu-hu*—vanishing in a rush, swelling and billowing in dense, murky masses—*weng-yu*—dim and obscure, shrouded in gloom—*hui-hui*—veiled in thick, shadowy mists—*ai-dai*, *an-dan*. They shroud the seas, engulf the mountains, eclipse the sun, and blanket the heavens. Who could be greater than this? Is not my greatness thus?\n\nThe thunder’s voice rumbles—*dian-hong-hong*—crashing and rolling—*li-li*, *huo-luo-luo*—terrifying and roaring, wheels of sound hurtling forth—*xi-xi*, *yin-lun*—rumbling like chariots—*gu-hu*—flashing lightning, splitting the air with crackling fury—*xie*, *xian*, *lie-que*, *xu-he*, *ting*, *pi-li*. Have you not heard it? The roaring of floodwaters, the drumming of thunder, the raging of fierce beasts—do those petty things compare to my might? Who could be greater than this? Is not my greatness thus?\n\nThe ocean’s waves surge—*hao-hu*, *han-hu*—spreading boundlessly—*chan-man*—swelling and crashing—*peng-hu*, *pai-hu*—pouring forth in torrents—*pang-pei*. What are the cries of Kun and Peng, the flapping of their vast wings? What of the overturning of turtles, the crashing of whales, the toppling of Mount Buzhou, the upending of the four seas? Who could be greater than this? Is not my greatness thus?\n\nAnd the fire’s blazing fury—*hong-hu*, *tong-hu*—flaring brilliantly—*huan-lan*—suddenly gathering—*xi-hu*.\n\nThe fire’s blazing fury—*yu-hu*, *shan-yi-hu*—roaring and raging—*fang-fang*, *zhuo-shuo*, *xuan-he*, *yu-hu*—drying up marshes, scorching mountains, blazing like the sun, searing the heavens—who could be greater than this? Is not my greatness thus?\n\nAnd the sun’s radiant glory—*huang-huang-hu*, *yang-yang-hu*—gleaming brilliantly—*jing-jing-hu*, *ying-ying-hu*—shining resplendently—*gao-gao*, *tong-tong*, *yan-yan*, *he-he*—illuminating heaven and earth, melting metal, dissolving stone—who could be greater than this? Is not my greatness thus?\n\nThe earth’s trembling might—*kun-hu*, *lun-hu*—spreading boundlessly—*yang-ya*, *pang-bo*—rising toweringly—*cui-hu*, *wei-hu*—with rugged hollows—*ao-qiao-qiao*, *fang-hu*—flooding seas, channeling rivers in ceaseless flow, making mountains race and hills flee without end—who could be greater than this? Is not my greatness thus?\n\nThe heavens’ resounding majesty—*gan-hu*, *yuan-hu*—vast and solemn—*que-hu*, *zhi-qiong-hu*, *chong-hu*, *kuo-hu*, *zhi-hao-huai-huai*—lofty and boundless—*dian-dian*, *min-cang-cang*, *xuan-xuan*—enveloping waters, whirling winds, covering the earth, encircling the void—who could be greater than this? Is not my greatness thus?\n\nThe void’s profound emptiness—*huo-hu*, *xue-hu*—expansive and open—*kuang-dang-hu*, *xu-hu*, *wu-hu*—vast and boundless—*mang-lang-hu*—ah!\n\nAmidst the misty vastness—*meng-tong*, *mang-tang*—verdant and boundless—*qing-fang*, *cang-mang*, *kuo*—ah!—enveloping heaven, swathing earth, birthing yin’s hidden depths and yang’s radiant might—who could be greater than this? Is not my greatness thus?\n\nThen the Nine Great Ones each vied in prowess: the wind’s assault cried, \"Who possesses greater might? Surely ours is the greatest!\" The Void replied, \"I have heard the Supreme’s discourse on the Dao’s name—its greatness may be sought and questioned.\" Thereupon clouds stilled their *qi*, winds ceased their drifting, the sun dimmed its brilliance, seas calmed their waves, earth settled its trembling, fire quenched its flames, heaven hushed its thunder, and the Void forsook its emptiness. Thus was Thunder ushered into the Dao’s realm—sound yielded to echo, form yielded to shadow—neither existing nor non-existing, neither moving nor still. The Nine Great Ones beheld this, each ashamed, and withdrew, yielding to the countenance of non-action, together forming a domain of non-action, enduring to the very end of kalpas.\n\nBehold! The Dao’s form—void. The Dao’s shadow—emptiness. The Dao’s sound—silence. The Dao’s echo—primordial resonance. Does it not resemble its ancient state?\n\nVast and empty—this is the Void.\nUtterly nonexistent—this is extinction.\nEternally primordial—this is remoteness.\nStill and unchanging—this is quiescence.\n\nIt is named *Yi-Xia-Ming-Mo-Que-Bo-Xuan-Yuan*—why?\n*Yi* to exhaust its loss,\n*Xia* to distance its remoteness,\n*Ming* to illuminate its light,\n*Mo* to deepen its stillness,\n*Que* to strengthen its steadfastness,\n*Bo* to enlarge its vastness,\n*Xuan* to spirit its subtlety,\n*Yuan* to compass its completeness.\n\nThus it is said: virtue is attainment. Attained—yet unattainable; unattained—yet not unattained.\n\nTo attain this—is this not what it means?\nWhat then is the attainment of virtue?\nThe *Wen Xuan* attains virtue yet remains selfless;\nLaozi attains virtue yet remains as an unformed child;\nNanhua attains virtue, roaming alone with the spirit of Heaven and Earth,\nunhaughty toward the myriad things.\nAlas! The *Chongxu* attains virtue, riding the wind with effortless coolness;\nYan Hui attains virtue, merging with the Great Thoroughfare.\nThus, the virtue of *Tailiao* knows no beginning nor end—\nI extend my thoughts yet cannot exhaust it.\nHow then may one fathom the bounds of existing things?\n\nThe glowworm that lights the night is but a candle in the belly;\nthe grub that burrows is but a chest for its body;\nthe ant that bears mustard seeds is but a carrier of filth;\nthe locust nymph is but the root of the cicada;\nthe firefly is but the radiance of *qixing* blossoms.\nThe worm of the candle-belly crawls along walls;\nthe worm of the chest-body emerges from cracks;\nthe worm that carries filth roams through crevices;\nthe worm of the root-cicada clings to leaves.\nThe chest-body laughs at the candle-belly:\n*\"You claim your way of nurturing life is secure—\nyet you are but a candle, a belly aglow,\nvisible only at night, wary of peril,\nchoosing and discarding so recklessly.\nHow strange that things perish while the body remains—\nnot like my hidden, carefree wandering!\"*\nThe filth-carrier laughs at the chest-body:\n*\"You claim your way of nurturing life is secure—\nyet you are but a bellows, a chest for your form,\nadvancing only to be exposed, retreating in fear,\never watchful, ever guarded.\nHow strange that things perish while the body remains—\nnot like my concealed, carefree wandering!\"*\nThe root-cicada laughs at the filth-carrier:\n*\"You claim your way of nurturing life is secure—\nyet you bristle with mustard seeds, laden with filth,\nstriding through the world unquestioned in your motion,\ncloaked in dung, unchallenged in your existence.\nYet you still fear wind and fire, still know alarm—\nnot like my buried, carefree wandering!\"*\nThese creatures each mock one another for their abilities.\nThen the *qixing* blossom hears and laughs at the root-cicada:\n*\"You claim your way of nurturing life is secure—\nyet you hide, your mouth concealed...\"*\n\n\"Eyes hollow,\nheart full,\nrooted in the belly—\nfeet moistening water and soil without moving,\nsprouting;\nspine receiving wind and sun without ceasing,\never growing, free from the suspicion of barriers or defenses.\nYet still encumbered,\nstill obstructed in substance,\nstill vulnerable to the chance hazard of digging and chiseling.\nHow strange that things perish while the body remains—\nnot like my fleeting, carefree wandering!\"\n\nThe root-cicada says: *\"I am endowed with the marvel of creation,\nknown through all ages for concealing my mouth, hollowing my eyes, filling my heart, and rooting in my belly.\nAmong these creatures who guard life, none compare to me.\nYet when I heard your voice, I knew not your form—\nfrom whence did your being arise?\"*\n\nThe *qixing* blossom replies: *\"I am born of the eye’s long gaze,\nits slow disorder, its swift threading like stars in alignment,\nits profusion like blossoms in their taking—\ngrasped yet unattainable, released yet inescapable.\nCalled ‘not’ yet present, called ‘is’ yet absent,\nit comes in a sudden flash of creation,\ndeparts in silent return to the Great Void.\nOnly one who roams the realm beyond things can glimpse\nmy wandering’s domain—\nthe same as the round, the same as the square.\"*\n\nThus in the square and the round—\nit is said: the perfectly round is without roundness yet can be square;\nthe perfectly square is without squareness yet can be round.\nWho can be round? The supremely square says: the Great Round.\nWho can be square? The supremely round says: the Great Square.\nTherefore the Great Square declares:\n*\"Long ago, I squared your roundness, yet you knew not my squareness.\"*\nThe Great Round replies:\n*\"Once, I rounded your squareness, yet you knew not my roundness.\"*\nIf so, then why?\nThere must be a reason.\nThus the compass traces emptiness—\nemptiness knows not its roundness.\nThe square draws void—\nvoid knows not its squareness.\nYet when the mind wanders to the realm of Great Stillness,\ncompass and square find no place for their skill.\nIs this not the work of the Great Round and the Great Square?\n\nThe dwarf people tell of a tale:\n*\"In the Eastern Sea there is a bird named the titi,\nsecond only to the giant peng in size.\nIt drifts upon the azure deep,\nswallows great whales whole,\nthen soars to plow the blue sky—\na plowshare of wind, a hunter of storms.\nYi the Archer, wielder of the great bow,\ngazed upon the titi’s flight and bent his bow to shoot.\nOne arrow struck true.\nThe titi’s roar shook the thunder,\nand in an instant, blood flowed like a river,\nfeathers darkened the sun,\nits plummeting form crashed through the misty void,\nfalling upon the boundless wilds.\nThe earth trembled,\nthe Great Void resounded,\ncreation itself recoiled in terror.\nYi circled the fallen titi for ten days,\nthen climbed upon its carcass to survey the four seas,\nwhere mists shrouded the earth.\nThereupon he summoned the empire’s cooks,\nwho scaled it with cloud-ladders and butchered it.\nThe steam from its cooking rose like clouds,\nthe mountains’ wood was exhausted,\nits dried meat fed the Central Lands for seven years without need for winter sacrifice,\nits fat lit foreign lands for nine years without need for oil.\nFrom its feathers, sails were made—\nthese were the titi-plumed ships that ruled the great sea.\nYi’s divine bow was revered,\nand every purification rite was followed by its worship.\nAll under heaven who prized strange lore\nharnessed their carriages to witness it—\nnever since creation had there been such might in bow and arrow.\nThus it remains.\nThe spirit of the waves endures.\"*\n\nThe spirit of the waves spoke, and the deities of the Jiang, Xu, Han, and He were called: the River Maiden stood in the wilds of Zhenyuan. The Jiang’s Xu asked the He’s Maiden, “I took you for water—why do you hang suspended yet never scatter, gleam by night yet never fade? What are these rivers?”\n\nThe River Maiden replied, “Generations have called me a deity to this point, yet what do I know? Have you not heard? The Heavenly Boat sails the Heavenly River, allowing the Herdboy and Weaving Maid to gaze upon each other—this is all I can do. May I ask: I took you for a current—why do you retreat when exhausted, advance with constancy? What is this knowing?”\n\nThe Jiang’s Xu said, “Generations have called me a spirit to this point, yet what do I know? Have you not heard? The swift thunder’s charge, the flock of egrets in flight, the white chariot and white horses—such is the army’s grand display. This is all I can do.”\n\nThereupon, Xu and Maiden gazed at each other and laughed, self-proclaimed as the most arrogant of spirits, as though no other Dao existed. They declared, “The utmost mystery lies here in the wilds of Zhenyuan.” Hearing this, one said to them, “What are you, Xu and Maiden? Now I shall tell you of heaven and earth’s creation, and you shall see that the waves and the Han exist. How can your kind borrow names from the mouths of shamans like Wu Xian, or from the annals of the *Spring and Autumn*? Is this not recent? The deluded may free themselves from doubt about the waves and the Han, but how can you, Xu and Maiden, accept the inquiries of the misguided and, unaware, claim the workings of creation as your own merit, unashamed of the deluded’s mockery as though you were already in the Yellow Springs?”\n\nXu and Maiden shuddered, bowed in apology, and asked, “We took you for a friend—silent yet unmoving, empty yet responsive, exposing our folly and shaming us. Do you, too, possess such a heart? We have heard that the Dao’s mystery precedes heaven and earth, dwelling in the wilds of Zhenyuan, called the Utmost Mystery. Are you not this noble one? What is your name? We beg you to explain the origins of our spirit and deity, and how we may come to understand the waves and the Han.”\n\nThe Utmost Mystery said, “I shall tell you. If you wish to know the Han’s nature, observe the jade’s veins: their patterns are pure and white, vast and boundless. The firefly’s belly holds the shift from dusk to dawn—such are the differences in form. How can the Maiden’s divinity be known? Even the vastness of the Celestial Han cannot be grasped by rivers. If you wish to know the waves’ nature, observe the blood in the vessels: its flow has a rhythm. The pagoda tree’s leaves open and close with the seasons—such is qi’s response. How can Xu’s spirit be known? Even the might of the sea’s waves cannot be seen by knowledge. If you wish to know my nature, observe emptiness: formless yet unmoving. The valley: passionless yet responsive. Such is the perfection of the void. How can there be any obstruction? Even the wonder of my Dao cannot be known by the heart.\n\nI shall tell you further: in the wastes of Kunlun dwells a creature of cunning, whose hearsay is like tumors, whose sight is like warts. They cling to my intangibility as though it were tangible, forcing strength upon the River Maiden’s divinity, fabricating the Jiang’s Xu’s spirit, and forging the Utmost Mystery’s name. Such is the rise of falsehood.\n\nNow, I observe: within the great expanse, six phenomena appear divine yet are not. The sea’s waves surge up the Jiang as tides; the celestial patterns gleam by night as the Han; the lightning’s flash is the cloud’s fiery glow; the rainbow’s hues are the sunlight’s reflection; the thunder’s roar is the yang qi’s turning in the void; the Dao’s manifestation is the mind’s encounter with the world. All that exists does so for a reason. It is not that your spirits lack my mystery—rather, my nothingness does not reside in your somethingness. What is there to be said?”\n\nXu and Maiden danced in unison, bowing in gratitude: “Truly, as you have said, we are ashamed before our old friend. We wish to accompany you in the journey of no-heart, to spend our years as those deceived by the cunning creature. In death, we shall return to the wilds of Zhenyuan. How could we again, in our pettiness, cling to the spirits of waves and Han, inviting the mockery of the deluded in the Yellow Springs?”\n\nThat summer, the Earl of Tongzhen rose to observe, while the Lord of Zuowang sat in forgetfulness—both had long cherished the mystery. In their discourse, the two lords debated the existence and nonexistence of the Dao, their arguments intertwined like linked gates, their dispute lasting the whole day without resolution. The Lord of Observation said, “I arose between the pavilions of Guan and know that the Dao is not nothing, yet see it as something.” The Lord of Forgetting replied, “I sat upon the Terrace of Forgetting and see that the Dao is not something, yet know it as nothing.”\n\nThe Earl of Tongzhen said to them, “The utmost Dao is not divided by the existence or nonexistence of things. Have you not seen the three luminaries? They appear or vanish, high or low, yet the sun and moon’s bodies differ in size, the stars’ positions vary in breadth. If you judge their size by distance, you err in the sun’s heat and cold. If you speak of distance by heat and cold, you err in the sun’s size. Thus, there is no difference in near or far—it is the human eye that makes it so. Take a hundred-foot pole: whether lying on a plate or standing upright, its nearness and farness are equal, yet its size differs. Truly, the eye has its level and peril.\n\nAs for the sun’s light in the east not blazing intensely—is it not because its rays, though bright, are not direct? From this, the earth’s yin qi ascends. Yet how is the utmost Dao perceived? By the heart.”\n\nJust so! In forgetting observation, they are not one—some deem it as being, some as nonbeing. If one takes the Dao as being, let Lord Guan stand upon the Terrace of Forgetting and perceive nonbeing. If one takes the Dao as nonbeing, let Forgetting Later wander the Observation Pavilion and know being. Thus, the heart of forgetting observation is itself so: the forms of being and nonbeing do not differ—it is the clinging and stagnation of intent that makes it so.\n\nYet those who contend over the nearness and farness of the three luminaries—do they not fail to grasp the level and peril? Those who contend over the being and nonbeing of the utmost Dao—have they not yet penetrated the obstruction of clinging and stagnation?\n\nThereupon, the two lords heard this, their tongues sharp, and withdrew.\n\nMaster Daguan said: “The barrier of divergence is one. The nearness and farness of the three luminaries, the being and nonbeing of the utmost Dao—cutting through the obscure affliction of past and present, shaving away the superfluity of indecisive discourse—let Lord Guan restrain his steps and Forgetting Later still his gate: this is truly the power of Zhenbo.”\n\nWu Sheng was skilled in the art of painting spirits. With powdered walls and inked brush, swift as wind and lightning, now his feet appeared first, now his hands. Once his body was revealed, his words proved true, as if naturally so. He bore his country’s name, having reached sixty years, yet all the painters under heaven traced his marvels without exhausting his mystery.\n\nMaster Xuanzhen heard of him and sought him out, saying: “May I dare ask—does the method of painting spirits have a technique? Why is your Dao inexhaustible?”\n\nWu Sheng rejoiced and replied: “Are you not a follower of painting? Why do you ask so profoundly?” Thereupon, as his brush flowed freely, he bowed to Master Xuanzhen and poured him wine. As the wine flowed freely, he bowed and served him tea. As the tea flowed freely, he dismissed his disciples, bowed to Master Xuanzhen, and lodged him for the night to converse. He revealed the method of painting spirits, saying: “What technique do I have? I possess only the Dao.\n\nI have often, in the midst of tea’s intoxication, remained awake past midnight, settling my spirit and emptying my thoughts, forgetting the existence of the myriad things and relinquishing every intent. After a long while, there comes a sudden clarity, a vastness—neither plain nor painted—where strange and wondrous forms arise, a thousand subtleties and ten thousand clumsinesses, one arising and one vanishing, coming without obstruction, ceaseless without exhaustion. I take the marvel of this Dao and the essence of its method, ever making the painting of spirits my task. I have never revealed the technique to others, which is why, at sixty years, I bear my country’s name. All under heaven regard me as the founder of painting spirits. Since my time, painters have flourished like a forest, desiring to see my form, hear my voice, yet none fully grasp my shape or exhaust my echo. They imitate my skill to the limit of their strength but cannot fathom my Dao.\n\nMoved by your question about the workings of creation, I cannot but respond in kind. Since I do not transmit this to others, I ask you to proclaim it in my stead.”\n\nMaster Xuanzhen declined, saying: “To trace the boundary is easy; to follow the image is difficult. Fortunately, I have heard the Dao of painting spirits—I have glimpsed the beginnings of creation. I shall not proclaim it in your stead. Do not say I have transmitted it.\n\nWater borne as a pearl is round—not by compass, yet it cannot be squared, for it departs from attachment. Embers formed into a wheel turn constantly—not by hoop, yet they cannot be broken, for their swiftness is unbroken. Spraying water with one’s back to the sun creates the form of a rainbow, yet it cannot be made straight, for its evenness lies in reflection. Drawing from the Yangtze to brew wine, it responds to the surging of waves yet cannot be stilled, for its harmony lies in qi. A single raindrop falling into the sea merges with the vast deep and cannot be distinguished, for it attains its unity. A tranquil heart returning to emptiness unites with the great void and cannot be divided, for it guards its heaven.\n\nThe sun and moon have the conjunction of jade disks; life and death have the beginning of cyclic return. One who determines the conjunction of jade disks knows that eclipses meet at fixed times. One who grasps the beginning of cyclic return knows that the barrier between life and death has its appointed time.\n\nThus, when the moon obscures the sun, its light dims; when the moon moves on, the sun shines. When the sun faces the moon, its brightness prevails; when they part, the moon glows. Thus, when death replaces life, the soul transforms; when death passes, life returns. When life forgets death, consciousness is empty; when forgetting is lost, death appears.\n\nTherefore, the moon’s brightness comes from the sun’s illumination. The appearance of death comes from the knowledge of life. Without illumination, the moon would not shine; without knowledge, death would not be seen.\n\nMoreover, the meeting of eclipses cannot harm the bodies of the sun and moon. The barrier between life and death cannot alter the spirit of the perfected person. Thus, the sun and moon have no worry of eclipses; the spirit does not change, so the perfected person has no fear of life and death.\n\nWhat is has never been without; what is not has never been with.”\n\nMoreover, that which has never been without does not possess, and that which has never been with does not lack—this is the ultimate of being and non-being. Thus, what is now suddenly absent was not formerly non-being’s unmanifest; what is now suddenly present was not formerly being’s unceasing. Is this not the strangeness of time?\n\nAs for the absence of that and the non-being of this, linking the past’s non-being and being without distinction; the merging of this being and non-being with the future’s being and non-being without difference—is this not the sameness of time? The strangeness of time lies in its alternation, which deems the inevitable as certain and guards against what is not so. The sameness of time lies in its alternation, which deems the uncertain as not so and guards against what is inevitable.\n\nThe shadow questioned the light: “I am obscured—is my body’s yin not bright? Your yang is radiant—is my substance’s origin not your surplus? Your midst is my exhaustion; your setting is my vanishing; your clarity is my brightness. Why do you favor the constant, forcing my command to lack permanence?”\n\nThe light answered the shadow: “You exist in emptiness, yet I exist in fullness; you are in flight, yet I am in motion; you bend in hooks, yet I curve in arcs; you straighten in lines, yet I extend in planes. Are you not near? The candle appears beyond your form. Are you not distant? The mirror enters within my substance. Is your lack of constancy not my own lack of permanence? Yet though you are the same, can I not be understood? I marvel at my own excess—though even I do not know why. Have I embraced the burning mirror’s inversion? Has your face suffered the net’s distortion? Has your leaf endured the sieve’s bending? I shall inquire of creation, exhaust principle, and fathom nature, yet what remains unknown is fate.”\n\nThe shadow laughed: “Simply withdraw your light, and I shall vanish. Being and non-being depend on you and me—what is contrary, what is correct? Why falsely impute this to fate’s decree?”\n\nSilence arrived. Silence said: “The first stillness unifies the One.” Silence said: “The second stillness divides the Two.” The first silence is non-being; the One is non-being. The second silence is being; the Two is being and non-being. Being and non-being unite as the One, yet do not depart from the Two; the Two is the Two, yet does not depart from—\n\n“If one knows that stillness is not unified and silence is not divided, this is called the true One. The true One is without one, without two, without stillness, without silence, without these four, and even without their absence—this is called the true Non-being.\n\nOnly one who roams the realm of true Non-being may then behold the visage of the true One. Thus, one who roams the realm of true Non-being and beholds the visage of the true One perceives all non-beings.\n\nStillness then said to Silence: ‘As for all non-beings, none can name them. If I must force a name upon them, I would call them the Realm of the Great Non-being. As for the Realm of the Great Non-being, none can bestow a title upon it. If I must force a title upon it, would you hear it?’\n\nSilence replied: ‘I would.’\n\nStillness then composed his bearing, regulated his qi, and settled into profound stillness. Without a word, time passed, and both forgot themselves.\n\nSilence awakened and said: ‘Before, I heard its name; now, I have seen its absence. Now, I hear its title, yet I have not seen its absence. Is this what is called the title of the Great Non-being?’\n\nStillness realized and said: ‘Just now, you and I engaged in a discourse of barriers, yet you truly heard it—you may be called enlightened to barriers. Since Silence has returned, Stillness shall cease discourse.’”\n\n**Preface to *Xuan Zhenzi* by Tian Yinzi**\n\nThe Dao of immortals takes longevity as its foundation, and the essence of longevity lies foremost in nurturing qi. Qi is received from Heaven and Earth, harmonized through yin and yang. Yin and yang, spirit and emptiness—these are called the heart. The heart governs day and night, waking and sleeping—these are called the hun and po. Thus, the human body is not far from the Dao of immortals.\n\nTian Yinzi—I know not from whence he came—composed eight chapters that encompass profound mysteries, far beyond what the worldly can attain. Studying them, one finds the refinement of form and qi, the cultivation of harmony, the emptiness of the heart, and the return to the root, aligning with [Laozi’s] *Boyang* and matching the illumination of [Zhuangzi’s] *Zhuang Sou*. For long life and enduring vision, no work surpasses this. Chengzhen practiced and followed its Daoist teachings. Alas, the world’s people are short-lived and truly long-lived; I wish to transmit this to like-minded seekers, making it simple to practice. Truly, since Boyang, only Tian Yinzi has achieved this. Respectfully inscribed.\n\n---\n\n**From the *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*: *Tian Yinzi***\n\n**Immortals**\n\nAt birth, humans receive the emptiness of qi, clarity, and understanding. When learning is unobstructed, this is called the spirit’s dwelling. The spirit resides within, its illumination extending outward, naturally setting one apart from the vulgar—this is called an immortal. Thus, immortals are also human. It lies in cultivating one’s emptiness of qi, not being swayed by worldly judgments, following one’s nature, and not being hindered by perverse views—then success is achieved.\n\n[Joy, anger, sorrow, delight, love, aversion, and desire—these seven are the deviations of emotion. Wind, cold, heat, dampness, hunger, satiety, fatigue, and excess—these eight are the deviations of qi. To cast off these deviations is to perfect the work of immortality.]\n\n**Simplicity**\n\nThe *Yi* says: “The Dao of Heaven and Earth is simple.” What does this mean? Tian Yinzi says: Heaven and Earth lie above my head and below my feet. Opening my eyes, I see them fully—no need for elaborate contrivance. Thus, the *Yi* says “simple.” Simplicity is the virtue of immortals.\n\n[The classics say: “The supreme Dao is not complex; the perfected person does not act.”]\n\nThen by what Dao is it sought? Without seeking, one cannot know; without the Dao, one cannot succeed. All who study immortality must first understand simplicity. If words veer into the strange or deceptive, they only lead people into delusion, leaving them without a true path—this is not my teaching.\n\n[There are those in the world who study immortality yet are misled by it, who study qi yet are harmed by it.]\n\n**The Gradual Gate**\n\nThe *Yi* has the *Gradual* hexagram; Laozi has the wondrous gate. Those who cultivate the true and realize their nature cannot achieve sudden enlightenment—they must advance gradually, practicing with ease. Thus, the Gradual Gate is established:\n\n1. Abstinence and purification\n2. Peaceful dwelling\n3. Concentrated contemplation\n4. Sitting in forgetfulness\n5. Spiritual liberation\n\nWhat is *abstinence and purification*? To cleanse the body and empty the heart.\nWhat is *peaceful dwelling*? To reside in seclusion and quietude.\nWhat is *concentrated contemplation*? To gather the heart and restore one’s nature.\nWhat is *sitting in forgetfulness*? To abandon form and forget the self.\nWhat is *spiritual liberation*? To penetrate all methods and unite with the spirit.\n\nThus, practicing these five gradual gates, mastering one leads step by step to the next. Mastering two, one advances to three; mastering three, to four; mastering four, to five—then immortality is achieved.\n\n**Abstinence and Purification**\n\nAbstinence and purification are not merely about vegetarian food or diet. Cleansing the body is not merely about bathing to remove filth. Its method lies in moderating food to harmonize the center and in rubbing and massaging to smooth the exterior.\n\nHumans receive the qi of the Five Phases and consume the substances of the Five Phases, yet their essence originates from the womb and takes form. Breath, essence, and blood—how can one abandon food and seek longevity? But the world’s people do not understand: fasting and absorbing qi are temporary expedients of Daoists, not the permanent cessation of grain. Eating requires abstinence and purification.\n\n*Abstinence* means purity and cleanliness; *purification* means moderation and caution. Eat when hungry, but do not overfill—this is called harmonizing the center. Do not eat unripe or overripe flavors, nor excessive tastes, nor spoiled or stagnant foods—these should all be avoided. Regularly rub the skin to warm it, dispelling cold qi—this is called smoothing the exterior. Prolonged sitting, standing, or labor should also be avoided. This is the method of regulating the body’s frame. When the form is firm, qi is preserved—thus, abstinence and purification are the first of the gradual gates.\n\n**Peaceful Dwelling**\n\nWhat is *peaceful dwelling*? It is not about ornate halls, secluded chambers, layered curtains, or broad couches.\n\nTo dwell peacefully is to sit facing south and sleep with the head to the east, balancing yin and yang, equalizing brightness and darkness. A dwelling must not be too high—excessive height breeds yang dominance and too much light. Nor should it be too low—excessive lowness breeds yin dominance and too much darkness. Too much light harms the *po*; too much darkness harms the *hun*. The *hun* belongs to yang, the *po* to yin; if brightness or darkness is harmed, illness arises. This is why the chamber of one’s dwelling must be so—how much more should one guard against the assault of extreme yang on the skin or the encroachment of excessive yin on the body? How could one not be cautious?\n\nThe gradual steps of self-cultivation, if not modeled on this, are not the Dao of peaceful dwelling. The method states: My dwelling has windows on all four sides; when wind comes, I close them; when the wind ceases, I open them. Before my seat hangs a curtain, behind it a screen. If too bright, I lower the curtain to harmonize the inner light; if too dark, I roll up the curtain to admit the outer radiance. Within, the heart is at peace; without, the eyes are at ease—when both heart and eyes are settled, all is well. If even brightness and darkness must be so regulated, how much more must excessive cares and desires be calmed to settle inner and outer?\n\nThus, in the study of the Dao, peaceful dwelling comes next.\n\n**Visualization**\n\n*Storage* means preserving one’s spirit; *visualization* means envisioning one’s body. When the eyes close, one sees one’s own eyes; when the heart is gathered, one sees one’s own heart. Heart and eyes never leave the body, nor harm the spirit—this is the gradual step of visualization. Ordinarily, the eyes all day long look outward, so the heart also strays outward; all day long, one engages with external affairs, so the eyes also gaze outward. Restless and scattered, the floating light never returns—how could one not fall ill or die young? Thus, returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called recovering life; completing one’s nature is called preserving and abiding—this is the gate of all wonders. Such is the gradual step of visualization, and half the work of studying the Dao is accomplished.\n\n**Sitting in Forgetfulness**\n\nSitting in forgetfulness is attained through visualization, and forgotten through visualization. To practice the Dao without seeing one’s practice—is this not the meaning of *sitting*? To see without acting upon what is seen—is this not the meaning of *forgetfulness*? What is *not acting*? The heart does not move. What is *not seeing*? The form is entirely dissolved. When Master Tianle closed his eyes and saw nothing, he awakened to the Dao and withdrew, saying: “The Dao is truly within me! But who am I? And who is Master Tianle?” Thereupon, self and other were both forgotten, and nothing remained to be illuminated.\n\n**Spiritual Liberation**\n\nFirst, abstinence is called *liberation through faith* (for without faith, the heart cannot be liberated).\nSecond, peaceful dwelling is called *liberation through leisure* (for without leisure, the heart cannot be liberated).\nThird, visualization is called *liberation through wisdom* (for without wisdom, the heart cannot be liberated).\nFourth, sitting in forgetfulness is called *liberation through concentration* (for without concentration, the heart cannot be liberated).\n\nFaith, concentration, leisure, and wisdom—these four gates communicate with the spirit, called *spiritual liberation*. The nature of spirit is to arrive without moving, to reach without haste. It transforms yin and yang, endures as long as heaven and earth, and encompasses the Three Realms—this is called the *Yi* (*Book of Changes*; as the *Xici* says: “Exhaustion leads to change, change leads to penetration, penetration leads to endurance”). It equalizes the ten thousand things—this is called the *Dao and virtue* (the *Daodejing* of Laozi). It originates from one nature—this is called *true suchness*.\n\nMaster Tianle was born within the *Yi*, died within the *Yi*, moved with the ten thousand things, and stilled with the ten thousand things. Whether in movement or stillness, deviation or truth, all arose from one nature. Thus, I resolve them all through spirit. In humans, this is called *immortality*; in heaven, *celestial immortality*; on earth, *earthly immortality*. Therefore, the Dao of spirit and immortality returns to a single gate (for the five gradual steps ultimately converge in immortality).\n\nMaster Tianle.",

Zhihe, styled Zitong, was a native of Wuzhou. Originally named Fuling, he passed the *mingjing* examinations during the reign of Emperor Suzong and was appointed to the Hanlin Academy. Later, due to an offense, he was demoted to the post of magistrate of Nanpu. After receiving amnesty, he returned but chose to wander rivers and lakes for the rest of his life, styling himself the \"Fisherman of Misty Waves\" and also the \"Master of Mystic Perfection.\" His biography is recorded in the *New Tang History* under the *Biographies of Recluses*, and Shen Fen’s *Continuation of the Biographies of Immortals* recounts his deeds in fantastical detail. Most of these accounts appear to be embellishments by enthusiasts; in truth, he was merely a man of serene retreat and self-preservation. According to the *Book Catalogue with Explanations*, his work originally consisted of twelve fascicles. By the time of Chen Zhensun, only three fascicles remained, and even these were incomplete. The present edition contains only three chapters—\"Azure Void,\" \"The Phoenix,\" and \"The Spirit of Waves\"—bound as one fascicle, differing from Chen’s description. Perhaps in the original, each chapter was treated as a separate fascicle. His writings vaguely resemble the *Outer Chapters* of the *Baopuzi*, though they lack its ornate elegance.\n\n*Tianyinzi* was also written by a Tang author, though his name is unknown. A preface by Sima Chengzhen suggests he was a contemporary of Empress Wu Zetian. Both Chao Gongwu and Chen Zhensun suspected the work was falsely attributed to Chengzhen. However, Chengzhen had already established his reputation with his own *Zuowanglun* (*On Sitting in Forgetfulness*), so why would he lend his name to this text?\n\nThe book consists of eight chapters: \"Divine Immortals,\" \"Simplicity and Ease,\" \"The Gradual Gate,\" \"Fasting and Abstinence,\" \"Tranquil Dwelling,\" \"Visualization,\" \"Sitting in Forgetfulness,\" and \"Spiritual Liberation.\" The *Record of Reading Books* mentions an edition with *The Three Palaces Method* appended, but this version omits it—likely lost in transmission.\n\nThe text is brief, spanning only a few pages, insufficient to form an independent fascicle. Given its contemporaneity with *Xuanzhenzi*, it is here appended to that work, following its classification.\n\n*Wunengzi*\n**Daoist School**",

      "translated_text": "We, your ministers, respectfully note: *Wunengzi* comprises three fascicles, with no author’s name recorded. The preface states it was written in the third year of Guangqi (887), when the Son of Heaven resided in Baoji—thus, its author was a contemporary of Emperor Xizong of Tang. The *Comprehensive Catalog of Chongwen* of the Song dynasty classifies it under the Daoist School. Chao Gongwu’s *Record of Reading Books* states the text contains thirty chapters expounding the natural principles of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Upon examination, however, the table of contents lists thirty-four chapters, matching the number cited in the preface. Yet in the first fascicle, the sixth chapter is noted as missing; in the second, the fifth; and in the third, six chapters—the seventh, ninth, tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth—are likewise absent. Thus, the complete work must have contained more than thirty-four chapters. Could it be that at the time, the text existed in name only, with chapters planned but never composed, their titles left vacant?\n\nThe book extensively borrows from the principles of Zhuangzi and Liezi, interspersed with Buddhist doctrines. Its language is rather shallow, yet as a surviving Tang work, it is now rare. We therefore include it in its original form, retaining its classification under the Daoist School.\n\nRespectfully submitted in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.\n\n**Chief Compilers:**\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collator:**\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n---\n\n**Original Preface to *Xuanzhenzi***\n\n*Xuanzhenzi* is the work of Zhang Zhihe of the Tang dynasty. Zhihe, styled Zitong, was a native of Wuzhou. His father, well-versed in the books of Zhuangzi and Liezi, composed the *Xiangwang* and *Baimai* chapters to support his teachings. Zhihe, originally named Ling, passed the *mingjing* examination at sixteen and presented a memorial to Emperor Suzong, who was so impressed that he summoned him to the Hanlin Academy and bestowed upon him his new name. Later, Zhihe was demoted to the post of magistrate of Nanpu due to a minor offense. After his pardon, he declined to return to office upon his parents’ deaths, dwelling instead among rivers and lakes. He styled himself the \"Fisherman of Mist and Waves\" and composed this book in three fascicles. Its prose flows freely and boldly, closely resembling the style of Zhuangzi and Liezi—truly the work of an extraordinary scholar. Li Deyu once praised him, saying he was \"reclusive yet renowned, illustrious yet unburdened by affairs, neither impoverished nor prosperous, the equal of Yan Guang.\"\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*",

      "translated_text": "*The Blue Void*\nBy Zhang Zhihe of the Tang\n\nThe Azure Void—its vastness turns the wheel within the abyssal depths, drifts upon the crimson earth, and encircles the celestial thoroughfares. The Well ascends as scorching flame, the Dipper descends as bitter cold; thus the four seasons revolve and the myriad things transform—this is but the secondary work of creation. Yet is it not the primordial origin of creation?\n\nThe Boundless is the sovereign of discourse. The Bound says: The Emperor of the Yellow Wilds is called *Zhibei*; the Emperor of the Purple Walls is called *Shenzun*; the Emperor of the Azure Void is called *Lingyou*. *Zhibei* reigns over the earth, to whom mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees belong. *Shenzun* reigns over the heavens, to whom the sun, moon, stars, and Milky Way belong. *Lingyou* reigns over the void, to whom wind, thunder, clouds, and rain belong.\n\nThe Azure Void, harmonizing the two Emperors, has its domain. In an instant, *Zhibei* ascends while *Shenzun* descends, meeting in the wilds of *Lingyou*. The Emperor of *Lingyou*, holding an empty position, welcomes them with all the realm’s abundance: piled meat becomes rosy clouds, fermented wine turns to rain, lightning races, thunder gallops, wind sings, and clouds dance. For months, *Lingyou* serves as the mediator of the middle way. Above and below, none harbor resentment; the two Emperors rejoice, humbled by *Lingyou*’s profound virtue. They command the Azure Void to cease its contention and yield the throne to extend *Lingyou*’s reign.\n\n*Shenzun* says: “I possess the heavens.”\n*Zhibei* says: “I possess the earth.”\n*Lingyou*, perplexed by the names “heaven” and “earth,” asks: “When I gaze upward, it is no different from the Azure Void; when I look downward, it is no different from the Azure Void. What else lies beyond the Azure Void?”\n\nThe Emperors speak of heaven and earth—what are their forms?\n\n*Zhibei* says: “My earth is vast in substance, thick in mass, the source of all life. Its center rises, its edges descend, its form layered like the earth’s strata, resembling an altar. All things are honored within its bounds: the eight directions encircled by seas, the nine mountains framed by bones of rock. Its flesh is soil, its veins are springs, its sweat is mist, its breath is vapor. Rivers and streams rush chaotically; humans, insects, birds, and beasts wander in profusion. I invite the Emperor to wander below.”\n\n*Shenzun* says: “My heaven is hollow in form, lofty in stature, the origin of all transformations. Its center is round, its edges revolve, its motion like the canopy of the celestial vault. All things are honored within: the five planets traverse, the constellations array in splendor, the sun and moon course along, and the Milky Way stretches across. Mists disperse, clouds and rosy dawns gather, immortals dwell in celestial palaces. I invite the Emperor to reside above.”\n\n*Lingyou* does not believe them: “If heaven is like a canopy, how is it suspended above? If earth is like an altar, what lies beneath it? How can it be stable?”\n\n*Shenzun* says: “The canopy of heaven is not suspended above; the drifting wheel bears it from below, ever revolving to the left, while the three luminaries follow it westward.”\n\n*Zhibei* says: “The altar of earth has abyssal depths that congeal and float above it—this is how it remains stable.”\n\n*Lingyou* asks: “The drifting wheel turns, giving life to the abyssal depths—what contains them? I wish to hear of this.”\n\n*Zhibei* says: “The drifting wheel pervades below; the abyssal depths rest upon it. Why doubt this?”\n\n*Lingyou* sighs: “Ah! The forms of heaven and earth, the workings of creation—truly, they are as you have described. I shall rest content. My void is an expanse of boundless vastness, equally empty and all-pervading, without inside or outside, without west or east. Vast and limitless, it embraces the azure clarity, contains the light of the sun and moon, resounds with the thunder’s roar, displays the hues of rainbows, and bears the forms of dragons and simurghs. Seated, I wander through it; reclining, I float upon it. Drifting freely, I may alight anywhere—spacious, all-encompassing, boundless, and open!”",

Before heaven and earth, its beginning remains unseen; after heaven and earth, its end cannot be known.

For months, the world remained unsettled, and heaven and earth sealed themselves in silence.\n\n*Hongxiazi* asked *Bixuzi*: “The origin of creation, the source of the natural—what is their true form?

Passing through the Domain of No-Dwelling, he encountered *Yinben*, from whom he sought passage.\n\n*Yinben* asked:\n*\"Who are you, and why have you come?\"*\nHe replied:\n*\"I am Hongxiazi. I go to reproach creation. I beg passage through your land.\"*\n\n*Yinben* refused him, saying:\n*\"Have you not heard of the price of seeking passage? You possess a chariot that soars through empty space and a jade disk that illumines the void—I shall open the gates for you.\"*\nHongxiazi said:\n*\"If I possessed such jade and chariot, would I reproach creation or seek passage from you?\"*\n\nThereupon, he brushed his robes and hastened northward. Passing through the Wilds of the Supreme Ultimate, he encountered *Shengshou*, from whom he sought passage.\n\n*Shengshou* rebuked him:\n*\"Why have you come to know so late? Creation may be known but never neighbored, heard but never befriended. Though you seek passage through my land, how shall you reach it? To reproach it—is this not impossible?\"*\n\nUpon hearing *Shengshou*’s rebuke, Hongxiazi stood stunned. Guardedly, he hesitated, turned his reins, and wheeled his chariot about. Passing through the outskirts of the Mystic Plain, he lost his way upon the herdsman’s path. His spirit was as changeable as the waters of the Mystic River, and so he wandered, seeking guidance.\n\nTwo boys asked:\n*\"Master, what clan do you belong to? You tread the void, brave the mist and clouds, and your chariot and horses weary of traversing empty space—where do you go to seek guidance?\"*\nHongxiazi replied:\n*\"I am Hongxiazi. I once knew creation, yet creation knows me not. It has left me bereft of the means to sustain myself, a disgrace among the vulgar. I go to reproach creation. I turned east, drove west, sped south, and hastened north, seeking passage from the four directions. In the east, I reached the Realm of Nothingness, where *Tongkong* questioned me; in the south, the Domain of the Natural, where *Huayuan* refused me; in the west, the Domain of No-Dwelling, where *Yinben* denied me; in the north, the Wilds of the Supreme Ultimate, where *Shengshou* rebuked me.

      "translated_text": "Yet who are you?\" Hongxiazi marveled, \"How magnificent your words!\"\n\nThe two lads replied: \"We speak of the spirit and the mutable. We herd the Dao alongside creation in the celestial wilds. We had just played the Six Passes' game, and both lost our Way. Fearing creation's reproach, we hesitated and lingered, bathing in the celestial plains. Moreover, burdened by our Dao-laden cares, how could we dare face creation? Yet you, sir, bring worldly shame to our lord—though you bear the questions of feudal lords, do not harbor even a single thought of offending creation. How could we again show our swimming and drifting upon these celestial plains? You have left the mortal realm, yet never beheld creation, lost at the ford and asking the way. If you lose your old home, with what face shall you meet the elders and brothers of the world? Why not disrobe and bathe here, swimming together, riding the waves, drifting with the currents, and roaming freely? Await the completion of our white plan, then we shall approach you and present you to creation—would that not bring you clarity?\"\n\nThereupon, Hongxiazi flushed with light, sinking and rising with the reflections, ascending the rapids, guarding against the waves. With the two lads, he rode the surging celestial tides, drifting beyond the six directions. In an instant, they reached creation's realm. The Natural offered constant garments; the Supreme Ultimate advanced the Infinite as food. Radiant, they filled creation's domain. Hongxiazi and the two lads donned and feasted upon the luminous glory, illuminating the six directions within. Then they prostrated before the True of Transformation, who turned and gazed upon the mortal world. Ashamed, Hongxiazi saw the glory and shame of the vulgar as illusory. He feared only that creation would know of his intended reproach.\n\nThereupon, creation questioned the two lads about the Dao's whereabouts. The lads replied: \"Nothing is lost, yet nothing is not lost. The Dao does not depart from the imperial homeland.\" Creation rejoiced, saying: \"That which has no being is not lost; that which is lost has no being. That which is not possessed is not lost; that which is not lost is not possessed. Release it to the celestial plains' outskirts, boundless—then the lads have found the method to herd the Dao.\"\n\nThereupon, Hongxiazi was filled with the garments of the Natural and sated with the food of the Supreme Ultimate. Delighted by creation's words and bearing creation's power, he bowed to creation and, with the two lads, turned and withdrew, intending to return to his old home. On this journey, he encountered the Void of Sameness in the Realm of Nothingness. The Void of Sameness said: \"Since you beheld creation, I have sought you, left your home, and dwelt in desolate solitude, thinking of you in the mortal world—are you well?\" Hongxiazi replied: \"I have but faced creation, received its countenance, and heard its heart. Creation's words made me know the supreme Dao's non-being. How could I see the being or non-being of the mortal world? The origin of transformation is the source. From being, observe its non-being; from non-being, observe its being. How can one describe this? Countenance is but the guarding of its numinous spirit.\"",

      "translated_text": "Vast and boundless is its primordial state—thus it is said: the guarding of the numinous essence is hard to fathom, and the boundless primordial is hard to detail. The myriad forms are inexhaustible, the myriad minds are without fixed direction. Therefore, those of old who ascended the Great Vastness to observe the origin of transformation knew its workings to be ceaseless.\n\nThey composed the *Song of the Great Vastness*, saying:\n*\"Origin of transformation—how numinous!\nAzure Void—how clear!\nCrimson Radiance—how bright!\nGuarding—how vast!\nBoundless—how indistinct!\nOnly the work of transformation is without limit!\"*\n\nWere one not to unify the distinctions of the myriad forms and the oneness of the myriad forms, nor harmonize the differences of the myriad minds and the singularity of the myriad minds—without thought, reaching the very threshold of guarding and boundlessness—how then could one wander through the Great Nothingness to observe the non-being of creation?\n\nThe *Yuyu* and the *YuYu* Clan came from the East; the *Suanni* Clan arrived from the Western Regions. They met in the wilds of the Central Lands and engaged in a contest of emptiness, battling with sounds to determine victory or defeat. Thereupon, the *Yuyu* Clan trilled like a bird, saying:\n\n*\"I have heard of sighs and exclamations, of scolding and hissing, of sighing and gasping—ah! The qi that is gulped, sipped, slurped, and sucked—spicy, sour, sweet, and bland—how they are tasted! Side glances and debates, squints and stares, sharp and piercing gazes—ah! The pupils that clatter, the reins that are pulled, the shields that are raised, the clangs and clatters, the guards and drums—how keen the hearing!\"*\n\nAt this, the *Suanni* Clan roared in response, saying:\n\n*\"I have heard of the sun and the moon, of comets and shooting stars—how radiant and bright they wheel! The peaks of heaven, the ridges, hills, and crags—how towering and jagged, how layered and steep! The surging tides, the waves, the overflows, the whirlpools—how roaring and vast, how billowing and sweeping! The sprites and demons, the goblins and specters—how they flicker and vanish, how they startle and disappear—ah! How extreme!\"*\n\nThey declared, *\"Our exchange has exhausted all words, our speech flows like a ceaseless spring—we have reached the limit!\"* Yet the *Yuyu* Clan sharpened its talons, whetted its beak, and played with its tongue, while the *Suanni* Clan bristled its fur, lashed its tail, and roared with its throat. The Master of the Central Lands sighed, saying:\n\n*\"If we speak of the body, the *Yuyu* Clan’s discourse is near; if we speak of things, the *Suanni* Clan’s discourse is far. These two lords have turned their backs on the silent realm, exhausting themselves in a battle of sounds. Though their flashing eyes blaze like lightning and their clamoring tongues thunder, they merely startle the birds of prey in the deep valleys—how could they echo the Dao in the vast ocean?\"*\n\nThe Great Vastness asked Boundless: *\"In the midst of creation, the ten thousand images are not one—can one seek the ultimate of small and large, being and non-being, and speak of it?\"*\n\nBoundless replied: *\"From my observation, the smallest becomes large, and the largest becomes small; the most non-existent becomes existent, and the most existent becomes non-existent. Do you understand this?\"*\n\nThe Great Vastness said: *\"From what I have heard, the smallest cannot be made large, the largest cannot be made small; the most non-existent cannot be made existent, and the most existent cannot be made non-existent. What do you mean by this?\"*\n\nBoundless said: *\"Let me tell you: in the realm of the smallest and largest, nothing surpasses emptiness; in the realm of the most non-existent and most existent, nothing surpasses the Dao. Why is this so? The Dao encompasses heaven and earth, and even what lies beyond being—is this not the ultimate greatness of emptiness? Yet when it divides and fills the tiniest speck of dust, does it not become the ultimate smallness of emptiness? When one traverses the six directions and finds nothing, is this not the ultimate non-being of the Dao? When one emerges from creation and cannot escape it, is this not the ultimate being of the Dao? Thus it is said: the smallest becomes large, the largest becomes small; the most non-existent becomes existent, and the most existent becomes non-existent—is this not also so?\"*\n\nAt the dawn of creation, the Nine Great Powers contended.

      "translated_text": "The spirit of the waves spoke, and the deities of the Jiang, Xu, Han, and He were called: the River Maiden stood in the wilds of Zhenyuan. The Jiang’s Xu asked the He’s Maiden, “I took you for water—why do you hang suspended yet never scatter, gleam by night yet never fade? What are these rivers?”\n\nThe River Maiden replied, “Generations have called me a deity to this point, yet what do I know? Have you not heard? The Heavenly Boat sails the Heavenly River, allowing the Herdboy and Weaving Maid to gaze upon each other—this is all I can do. May I ask: I took you for a current—why do you retreat when exhausted, advance with constancy? What is this knowing?”\n\nThe Jiang’s Xu said, “Generations have called me a spirit to this point, yet what do I know? Have you not heard? The swift thunder’s charge, the flock of egrets in flight, the white chariot and white horses—such is the army’s grand display. This is all I can do.”\n\nThereupon, Xu and Maiden gazed at each other and laughed, self-proclaimed as the most arrogant of spirits, as though no other Dao existed. They declared, “The utmost mystery lies here in the wilds of Zhenyuan.” Hearing this, one said to them, “What are you, Xu and Maiden? Now I shall tell you of heaven and earth’s creation, and you shall see that the waves and the Han exist. How can your kind borrow names from the mouths of shamans like Wu Xian, or from the annals of the *Spring and Autumn*? Is this not recent? The deluded may free themselves from doubt about the waves and the Han, but how can you, Xu and Maiden, accept the inquiries of the misguided and, unaware, claim the workings of creation as your own merit, unashamed of the deluded’s mockery as though you were already in the Yellow Springs?”\n\nXu and Maiden shuddered, bowed in apology, and asked, “We took you for a friend—silent yet unmoving, empty yet responsive, exposing our folly and shaming us. Do you, too, possess such a heart? We have heard that the Dao’s mystery precedes heaven and earth, dwelling in the wilds of Zhenyuan, called the Utmost Mystery. Are you not this noble one? What is your name? We beg you to explain the origins of our spirit and deity, and how we may come to understand the waves and the Han.”\n\nThe Utmost Mystery said, “I shall tell you. If you wish to know the Han’s nature, observe the jade’s veins: their patterns are pure and white, vast and boundless. The firefly’s belly holds the shift from dusk to dawn—such are the differences in form. How can the Maiden’s divinity be known? Even the vastness of the Celestial Han cannot be grasped by rivers. If you wish to know the waves’ nature, observe the blood in the vessels: its flow has a rhythm. The pagoda tree’s leaves open and close with the seasons—such is qi’s response. How can Xu’s spirit be known? Even the might of the sea’s waves cannot be seen by knowledge. If you wish to know my nature, observe emptiness: formless yet unmoving. The valley: passionless yet responsive. Such is the perfection of the void. How can there be any obstruction? Even the wonder of my Dao cannot be known by the heart.\n\nI shall tell you further: in the wastes of Kunlun dwells a creature of cunning, whose hearsay is like tumors, whose sight is like warts. They cling to my intangibility as though it were tangible, forcing strength upon the River Maiden’s divinity, fabricating the Jiang’s Xu’s spirit, and forging the Utmost Mystery’s name. Such is the rise of falsehood.\n\nNow, I observe: within the great expanse, six phenomena appear divine yet are not. The sea’s waves surge up the Jiang as tides; the celestial patterns gleam by night as the Han; the lightning’s flash is the cloud’s fiery glow; the rainbow’s hues are the sunlight’s reflection; the thunder’s roar is the yang qi’s turning in the void; the Dao’s manifestation is the mind’s encounter with the world. All that exists does so for a reason. It is not that your spirits lack my mystery—rather, my nothingness does not reside in your somethingness. What is there to be said?”\n\nXu and Maiden danced in unison, bowing in gratitude: “Truly, as you have said, we are ashamed before our old friend. We wish to accompany you in the journey of no-heart, to spend our years as those deceived by the cunning creature. In death, we shall return to the wilds of Zhenyuan. How could we again, in our pettiness, cling to the spirits of waves and Han, inviting the mockery of the deluded in the Yellow Springs?”\n\nThat summer, the Earl of Tongzhen rose to observe, while the Lord of Zuowang sat in forgetfulness—both had long cherished the mystery. In their discourse, the two lords debated the existence and nonexistence of the Dao, their arguments intertwined like linked gates, their dispute lasting the whole day without resolution. The Lord of Observation said, “I arose between the pavilions of Guan and know that the Dao is not nothing, yet see it as something.” The Lord of Forgetting replied, “I sat upon the Terrace of Forgetting and see that the Dao is not something, yet know it as nothing.”\n\nThe Earl of Tongzhen said to them, “The utmost Dao is not divided by the existence or nonexistence of things. Have you not seen the three luminaries? They appear or vanish, high or low, yet the sun and moon’s bodies differ in size, the stars’ positions vary in breadth. If you judge their size by distance, you err in the sun’s heat and cold. If you speak of distance by heat and cold, you err in the sun’s size. Thus, there is no difference in near or far—it is the human eye that makes it so. Take a hundred-foot pole: whether lying on a plate or standing upright, its nearness and farness are equal, yet its size differs. Truly, the eye has its level and peril.\n\nAs for the sun’s light in the east not blazing intensely—is it not because its rays, though bright, are not direct? From this, the earth’s yin qi ascends. Yet how is the utmost Dao perceived? By the heart.”",

If one takes the Dao as being, let Lord Guan stand upon the Terrace of Forgetting and perceive nonbeing. If one takes the Dao as nonbeing, let Forgetting Later wander the Observation Pavilion and know being. Thus, the heart of forgetting observation is itself so: the forms of being and nonbeing do not differ—it is the clinging and stagnation of intent that makes it so.\n\nYet those who contend over the nearness and farness of the three luminaries—do they not fail to grasp the level and peril? Those who contend over the being and nonbeing of the utmost Dao—have they not yet penetrated the obstruction of clinging and stagnation?\n\nThereupon, the two lords heard this, their tongues sharp, and withdrew.\n\nMaster Daguan said: “The barrier of divergence is one. The nearness and farness of the three luminaries, the being and nonbeing of the utmost Dao—cutting through the obscure affliction of past and present, shaving away the superfluity of indecisive discourse—let Lord Guan restrain his steps and Forgetting Later still his gate: this is truly the power of Zhenbo.”\n\nWu Sheng was skilled in the art of painting spirits. With powdered walls and inked brush, swift as wind and lightning, now his feet appeared first, now his hands. Once his body was revealed, his words proved true, as if naturally so. He bore his country’s name, having reached sixty years, yet all the painters under heaven traced his marvels without exhausting his mystery.\n\nMaster Xuanzhen heard of him and sought him out, saying: “May I dare ask—does the method of painting spirits have a technique? Why is your Dao inexhaustible?”\n\nWu Sheng rejoiced and replied: “Are you not a follower of painting? Why do you ask so profoundly?” Thereupon, as his brush flowed freely, he bowed to Master Xuanzhen and poured him wine. As the wine flowed freely, he bowed and served him tea. As the tea flowed freely, he dismissed his disciples, bowed to Master Xuanzhen, and lodged him for the night to converse. He revealed the method of painting spirits, saying: “What technique do I have? I possess only the Dao.\n\nI have often, in the midst of tea’s intoxication, remained awake past midnight, settling my spirit and emptying my thoughts, forgetting the existence of the myriad things and relinquishing every intent. After a long while, there comes a sudden clarity, a vastness—neither plain nor painted—where strange and wondrous forms arise, a thousand subtleties and ten thousand clumsinesses, one arising and one vanishing, coming without obstruction, ceaseless without exhaustion. I take the marvel of this Dao and the essence of its method, ever making the painting of spirits my task. I have never revealed the technique to others, which is why, at sixty years, I bear my country’s name. All under heaven regard me as the founder of painting spirits. Since my time, painters have flourished like a forest, desiring to see my form, hear my voice, yet none fully grasp my shape or exhaust my echo. They imitate my skill to the limit of their strength but cannot fathom my Dao.\n\nMoved by your question about the workings of creation, I cannot but respond in kind. Since I do not transmit this to others, I ask you to proclaim it in my stead.”\n\nMaster Xuanzhen declined, saying: “To trace the boundary is easy; to follow the image is difficult. Fortunately, I have heard the Dao of painting spirits—I have glimpsed the beginnings of creation. I shall not proclaim it in your stead. Do not say I have transmitted it.\n\nWater borne as a pearl is round—not by compass, yet it cannot be squared, for it departs from attachment. Embers formed into a wheel turn constantly—not by hoop, yet they cannot be broken, for their swiftness is unbroken. Spraying water with one’s back to the sun creates the form of a rainbow, yet it cannot be made straight, for its evenness lies in reflection. Drawing from the Yangtze to brew wine, it responds to the surging of waves yet cannot be stilled, for its harmony lies in qi. A single raindrop falling into the sea merges with the vast deep and cannot be distinguished, for it attains its unity. A tranquil heart returning to emptiness unites with the great void and cannot be divided, for it guards its heaven.\n\nThe sun and moon have the conjunction of jade disks; life and death have the beginning of cyclic return. One who determines the conjunction of jade disks knows that eclipses meet at fixed times. One who grasps the beginning of cyclic return knows that the barrier between life and death has its appointed time.\n\nThus, when the moon obscures the sun, its light dims; when the moon moves on, the sun shines. When the sun faces the moon, its brightness prevails; when they part, the moon glows. Thus, when death replaces life, the soul transforms; when death passes, life returns. When life forgets death, consciousness is empty; when forgetting is lost, death appears.\n\nTherefore, the moon’s brightness comes from the sun’s illumination. The appearance of death comes from the knowledge of life. Without illumination, the moon would not shine; without knowledge, death would not be seen.\n\nMoreover, the meeting of eclipses cannot harm the bodies of the sun and moon. The barrier between life and death cannot alter the spirit of the perfected person. Thus, the sun and moon have no worry of eclipses; the spirit does not change, so the perfected person has no fear of life and death.\n\nWhat is has never been without; what is not has never been with.”",

Truly, the eye has its level and peril.\n\nAs for the sun’s light in the east not blazing intensely—is it not because its rays, though bright, are not direct? From this, the earth’s yin qi ascends. Yet how is the utmost Dao perceived? By the heart.”",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to *Xuan Zhenzi* by Tian Yinzi**\n\nThe Dao of immortals takes longevity as its foundation, and the essence of longevity lies foremost in nurturing qi. Qi is received from Heaven and Earth, harmonized through yin and yang. Yin and yang, spirit and emptiness—these are called the heart. The heart governs day and night, waking and sleeping—these are called the hun and po. Thus, the human body is not far from the Dao of immortals.\n\nTian Yinzi—I know not from whence he came—composed eight chapters that encompass profound mysteries, far beyond what the worldly can attain. Studying them, one finds the refinement of form and qi, the cultivation of harmony, the emptiness of the heart, and the return to the root, aligning with [Laozi’s] *Boyang* and matching the illumination of [Zhuangzi’s] *Zhuang Sou*. For long life and enduring vision, no work surpasses this. Chengzhen practiced and followed its Daoist teachings. Alas, the world’s people are short-lived and truly long-lived; I wish to transmit this to like-minded seekers, making it simple to practice. Truly, since Boyang, only Tian Yinzi has achieved this. Respectfully inscribed.\n\n---\n\n**From the *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*: *Tian Yinzi***\n\n**Immortals**\n\nAt birth, humans receive the emptiness of qi, clarity, and understanding. When learning is unobstructed, this is called the spirit’s dwelling. The spirit resides within, its illumination extending outward, naturally setting one apart from the vulgar—this is called an immortal. Thus, immortals are also human. It lies in cultivating one’s emptiness of qi, not being swayed by worldly judgments, following one’s nature, and not being hindered by perverse views—then success is achieved.\n\n[Joy, anger, sorrow, delight, love, aversion, and desire—these seven are the deviations of emotion. Wind, cold, heat, dampness, hunger, satiety, fatigue, and excess—these eight are the deviations of qi. To cast off these deviations is to perfect the work of immortality.]\n\n**Simplicity**\n\nThe *Yi* says: “The Dao of Heaven and Earth is simple.” What does this mean? Tian Yinzi says: Heaven and Earth lie above my head and below my feet. Opening my eyes, I see them fully—no need for elaborate contrivance. Thus, the *Yi* says “simple.” Simplicity is the virtue of immortals.\n\n[The classics say: “The supreme Dao is not complex; the perfected person does not act.”]\n\nThen by what Dao is it sought? Without seeking, one cannot know; without the Dao, one cannot succeed. All who study immortality must first understand simplicity. If words veer into the strange or deceptive, they only lead people into delusion, leaving them without a true path—this is not my teaching.\n\n[There are those in the world who study immortality yet are misled by it, who study qi yet are harmed by it.]\n\n**The Gradual Gate**\n\nThe *Yi* has the *Gradual* hexagram; Laozi has the wondrous gate. Those who cultivate the true and realize their nature cannot achieve sudden enlightenment—they must advance gradually, practicing with ease. Thus, the Gradual Gate is established:\n\n1. Abstinence and purification\n2. Peaceful dwelling\n3. Concentrated contemplation\n4. Sitting in forgetfulness\n5. Spiritual liberation\n\nWhat is *abstinence and purification*? To cleanse the body and empty the heart.\nWhat is *peaceful dwelling*? To reside in seclusion and quietude.\nWhat is *concentrated contemplation*? To gather the heart and restore one’s nature.\nWhat is *sitting in forgetfulness*? To abandon form and forget the self.\nWhat is *spiritual liberation*? To penetrate all methods and unite with the spirit.\n\nThus, practicing these five gradual gates, mastering one leads step by step to the next. Mastering two, one advances to three; mastering three, to four; mastering four, to five—then immortality is achieved.\n\n**Abstinence and Purification**\n\nAbstinence and purification are not merely about vegetarian food or diet. Cleansing the body is not merely about bathing to remove filth. Its method lies in moderating food to harmonize the center and in rubbing and massaging to smooth the exterior.\n\nHumans receive the qi of the Five Phases and consume the substances of the Five Phases, yet their essence originates from the womb and takes form. Breath, essence, and blood—how can one abandon food and seek longevity? But the world’s people do not understand: fasting and absorbing qi are temporary expedients of Daoists, not the permanent cessation of grain. Eating requires abstinence and purification.\n\n*Abstinence* means purity and cleanliness; *purification* means moderation and caution. Eat when hungry, but do not overfill—this is called harmonizing the center. Do not eat unripe or overripe flavors, nor excessive tastes, nor spoiled or stagnant foods—these should all be avoided. Regularly rub the skin to warm it, dispelling cold qi—this is called smoothing the exterior. Prolonged sitting, standing, or labor should also be avoided. This is the method of regulating the body’s frame. When the form is firm, qi is preserved—thus, abstinence and purification are the first of the gradual gates.\n\n**Peaceful Dwelling**\n\nWhat is *peaceful dwelling*? It is not about ornate halls, secluded chambers, layered curtains, or broad couches.",

      "translated_text": "To dwell peacefully is to sit facing south and sleep with the head to the east, balancing yin and yang, equalizing brightness and darkness. A dwelling must not be too high—excessive height breeds yang dominance and too much light. Nor should it be too low—excessive lowness breeds yin dominance and too much darkness. Too much light harms the *po*; too much darkness harms the *hun*. The *hun* belongs to yang, the *po* to yin; if brightness or darkness is harmed, illness arises. This is why the chamber of one’s dwelling must be so—how much more should one guard against the assault of extreme yang on the skin or the encroachment of excessive yin on the body? How could one not be cautious?\n\nThe gradual steps of self-cultivation, if not modeled on this, are not the Dao of peaceful dwelling. The method states: My dwelling has windows on all four sides; when wind comes, I close them; when the wind ceases, I open them. Before my seat hangs a curtain, behind it a screen. If too bright, I lower the curtain to harmonize the inner light; if too dark, I roll up the curtain to admit the outer radiance. Within, the heart is at peace; without, the eyes are at ease—when both heart and eyes are settled, all is well. If even brightness and darkness must be so regulated, how much more must excessive cares and desires be calmed to settle inner and outer?\n\nThus, in the study of the Dao, peaceful dwelling comes next.\n\n**Visualization**\n\n*Storage* means preserving one’s spirit; *visualization* means envisioning one’s body. When the eyes close, one sees one’s own eyes; when the heart is gathered, one sees one’s own heart. Heart and eyes never leave the body, nor harm the spirit—this is the gradual step of visualization. Ordinarily, the eyes all day long look outward, so the heart also strays outward; all day long, one engages with external affairs, so the eyes also gaze outward. Restless and scattered, the floating light never returns—how could one not fall ill or die young? Thus, returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called recovering life; completing one’s nature is called preserving and abiding—this is the gate of all wonders. Such is the gradual step of visualization, and half the work of studying the Dao is accomplished.\n\n**Sitting in Forgetfulness**\n\nSitting in forgetfulness is attained through visualization, and forgotten through visualization. To practice the Dao without seeing one’s practice—is this not the meaning of *sitting*? To see without acting upon what is seen—is this not the meaning of *forgetfulness*? What is *not acting*? The heart does not move. What is *not seeing*? The form is entirely dissolved. When Master Tianle closed his eyes and saw nothing, he awakened to the Dao and withdrew, saying: “The Dao is truly within me! But who am I? And who is Master Tianle?” Thereupon, self and other were both forgotten, and nothing remained to be illuminated.\n\n**Spiritual Liberation**\n\nFirst, abstinence is called *liberation through faith* (for without faith, the heart cannot be liberated).\nSecond, peaceful dwelling is called *liberation through leisure* (for without leisure, the heart cannot be liberated).\nThird, visualization is called *liberation through wisdom* (for without wisdom, the heart cannot be liberated).\nFourth, sitting in forgetfulness is called *liberation through concentration* (for without concentration, the heart cannot be liberated).\n\nFaith, concentration, leisure, and wisdom—these four gates communicate with the spirit, called *spiritual liberation*. The nature of spirit is to arrive without moving, to reach without haste. It transforms yin and yang, endures as long as heaven and earth, and encompasses the Three Realms—this is called the *Yi* (*Book of Changes*; as the *Xici* says: “Exhaustion leads to change, change leads to penetration, penetration leads to endurance”). It equalizes the ten thousand things—this is called the *Dao and virtue* (the *Daodejing* of Laozi). It originates from one nature—this is called *true suchness*.\n\nMaster Tianle was born within the *Yi*, died within the *Yi*, moved with the ten thousand things, and stilled with the ten thousand things. Whether in movement or stillness, deviation or truth, all arose from one nature. Thus, I resolve them all through spirit. In humans, this is called *immortality*; in heaven, *celestial immortality*; on earth, *earthly immortality*. Therefore, the Dao of spirit and immortality returns to a single gate (for the five gradual steps ultimately converge in immortality).\n\nMaster Tianle.",

Prolonged sitting, standing, or labor should also be avoided. This is the method of regulating the body’s frame. When the form is firm, qi is preserved—thus, abstinence and purification are the first of the gradual gates.\n\n**Peaceful Dwelling**\n\nWhat is *peaceful dwelling*? It is not about ornate halls, secluded chambers, layered curtains, or broad couches.",
