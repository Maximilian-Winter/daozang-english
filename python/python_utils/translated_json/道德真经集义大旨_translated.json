  "full_translation": "**The Great Essence of the Dao-De Jing: Collected Meanings and Grand Purpose**\n\n**Title:** *The Great Essence of the Dao-De Jing: Collected Meanings and Grand Purpose*\nCompiled by Yuan Suiyong. Three volumes.\nSource text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dongshen* (Cavernous Gods) Section, *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) Category.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: Preface to the Illustrated Sequence of the Dao-De Jing**\n\n**The Valley Spirit Diagram**\nThe Valley Spirit is the divine essence housed within the five viscera.\nMany have interpreted this meaning, some pointing to the Mysterious Female as the heart, others to the Valley Spirit as the heart—both are incorrect.\nKnow this: the Spirit is the divine essence of the five viscera. When essence is unexhausted and *qi* is unimpaired, the Spirit is nourished and does not perish, and the form’s visage shines with radiance.\n\n**The Thirty-Spoke Diagram**\nThe Obtained-One Diagram\nThe Dao-Generates-One Diagram\nSpeaking metaphorically of humanity, all things are the same.\nThe \"few\" are youthful men and women;\nThe \"middle\" are middle-aged men and women;\nThe \"long\" are aged men and women.\nIf death does not come in its proper time, then *qi* disperses and I do not return to the Two *Qi*’s—*Hun-Yuan*’s unity.\n\n**The Birth-and-Death Diagram**\nThe Dao-Generates-Virtue-Nourishes Diagram\nThe Dao generates me; virtue stores me; form shapes me; power perfects me—this is the marvelous work.\n\n**The Great Emptiness Begins with One Diagram**\nThe boundless Dao, void and natural, gives rise to One *Qi*, congealing into *Hun-Dun* (Chaos), within which the Three Powers are contained.\nOnce the Three Powers are divided, the upper and lower positions are established—not through sensation, but naturally.\nThus it is said: *The Void is natural.*\n\nThe Dao originates from the Void, and from this One *Qi*, the myriad things are generated to fulfill daily needs, without end.\n\n**The Nine Heavens Generate the Spirit Diagram**\nGreen, yellow, and white each generate three heavens—three threes make nine heavens.\nEach of the nine heavens generates three heavens—three nines make twenty-seven heavens.\nCombined with the three palaces of Metal, Fire, and Earth, totaling nine heavens, there are thirty-six heavens.\n\n*The Scripture of the Primordial Arrangement of Heaven* states:\n*\"The Primordial Origin’s *Qi* pervades the luminous body, and the Three *Qi* transform into form, manifesting the Three Caverns.\nThe first is the Azure Light, born in the Heavenly Primordial, the second is the White Light, born in the Human Mysterious, the third is the Yellow Light, born in the Earthly Primordial.\nFrom these three colors, the Nine Lights are generated.\nThe Partial Arising of the Dharma-Body shines resplendently.\nNow, detailing the origins of the Three Pure Ones, from the three colors, the Three Treasures are divided—all derived from One *Qi*.\nThus, the Great Void begins with One, One *Qi* divides into Three, establishing the *Qi*, colors, and forms of the Three Pure Ones.\nHence, the Three Pure Ones are called *Natural*.\nNeither father nor mother, neither yin nor yang, they inherit the natural *qi* and give rise to the Three Extremes.\"\n\nThe Venerable Lord Laozi, across kalpas of transformation, manifests in heaven and earth, sometimes taking fetal form—his origin lies in the Three *Qi*’s divided lights forming the Three Pure Ones.\n\n**The Nine-Colored Treasure Lights**\nAt first, *Hun-Hun* becomes the Azure Light.\n*Hun* generates *Dong-Dong*, becoming the Red Light.\n*Dong* generates *Hao-Hao*, becoming the Azure Light.\n*Yuan* generates *Hao-Hao*, becoming the Green Light.\n*Hao* generates *Jing-Jing*, becoming the Yellow Light.\n*Jing* generates *Dun-Dun*, becoming the White Light.\n*Xuan* generates *Rong-Rong*, becoming the Purple Light.\n*Rong* generates *Yan-Yan*, becoming the Azure Light.\n*Yan* generates *Yan-Yan*, becoming the Black Light.\n\nFrom this, the Four Heavens of the East (East华), South (South极), West (West灵), and North (North真) are divided.\nEach heaven generates eight heavens—such as the Great Sovereign, Yellow Ancestor, etc.\nFour eights make thirty-two heavens, which are the Three Realms.\nCombined with the four heavens above, there are thirty-six heavens.\nThe Great Luo and Middle Luo together make seventy-two, corresponding to the numbers of heaven and earth.\nThe seventy-two constellations, combined with the nine heavens above, form the eighty-one *Tai-Xuan*.\nThe Four Regions and Clans take this number.\n\n**The Four Beginnings Diagram**\nEarth obtains the number five as its root number, and also obtains four numbers, including one from Water, making five in total.\nEarth corresponds to the *Kun* hexagram, divided into twelve—also called One *Qi*.\nThus, the Twelve Radiant Ones are opened to encompass the beginning.\n\n**The Diagram of Responding to the Heart’s Use**\nThe True Person’s Precept:\nImagine the Twenty-Eight Constellations encompassing the body to assist the Seven Governors.\nFollowing this method, each constellation spans thirteen degrees, storing an imagined year’s *gui* (retreat), calculating two degrees, alternating counts—twelve places, each storing two constellations, except the Heart, which stores four, totaling twenty-eight.\nThis is no other than pointing to the Dao generating the Mysterious Homeland, responding to the heart’s use—thus, the four central ones begin with the Void Constellation.\n\n**The Dao-Generates-One Diagram**\nHeaven’s arrangement of the Three Celestial Marks and command over all things is all from the Dao.\nThe Dao, without end or beginning, generates from the Mysterious Homeland.\nAccording to the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Child corresponds to the Void Constellation—One *Qi* returns to the Yellow Palace, then disperses, then generates, and all things receive their mandate here.\nThus, the Void is the Dao, and the Dao generates from the Void.\nConsidering heaven, the Void lies in the Mysterious Homeland’s profound darkness, and the Dao generates One.\nAmong the Twenty-Eight Mansions, the Void Constellation exists, and the twelve palace divisions include the Water Jar—speaking of the统 (unification) of Primordial *Qi*.\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* states: In heaven, it is the Mysterious; on earth, it is the Female; in humanity, it is the Dao—this is because thunder returns to the Shocking.\n\n**The Mysterious Female Diagram**\n**The Heavenly Gate’s Opening and Closing: Guarding the Feminine Diagram**\nThe Dao is One.\nOne transforms into Three, becoming *Qian* (Creative)—*Qian* is yang.\n*Qian* interchanges and transforms into *Kun* (Receptive)—yin and yang wax and wane, transforming here.\n*Wei* and *Hai* intermingle, *Qian* and *Kun* naturally unite—male does not depart from female; this is the Dao of Heaven.\nHumans who embody this align with the Dao’s use.\n\n**The Thirteen Birth-and-Death Diagram**\n**The Thirteen Methods of Seizing Life to Avoid Death Diagram**\nThe Venerable Lord says:\nTrue Water and True Fire correspond to the Dao’s true body and cannot be momentarily separated.\nThat which can be separated and yet preserved is neither thing nor person.\nThis meaning is like comparing worldly water and fire.\nTrue Water and True Fire, *Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire) paired, with withdrawal and supplementation governed by principle, used at the proper time—\nthen these thirteen [methods] are not the same as the previous thirteen birth-and-death [cycles].\n\nThus it is said: **\"The Way of Life Without Death\"** lies therein.\n\nThe Dao has two Dao, and virtue has three virtue.\nThe first is the Dao of **Emptiness-Nothingness-No-Action**,\nthe second is the Dao of **One Qi with Action**—\nHence, the Dao has two Dao, yet they differ in depth and shallowness.\nThe Dao of **One Qi** is also called the **Supreme Virtue**.\nFrom the **Supreme Virtue** downward, all belong to the realm of **Action**,\nThus they are called the **Three Virtue**.\nBy distinguishing the inner and outer, these are all the genuine paths of the Dao.\n\nNow, the **Four Categories**—Dao, virtue, yin-yang, and human affairs—\nwhen harmonized and unified, form a single school.\nIf one cannot reconcile them, then progress is obstructed at every turn,\nand scholars must carefully examine this.\n\n**The *Dao De* True Scripture: A Collection of Commentaries from Various Families**\n\n**He Shang Gong**—a Han-era scholar, who composed annotations.\n**Wang Fu Si**—a Wei-era scholar, whose given name was **Bì**, who composed annotations.\n**Emperor Xuānzōng of the Tang**—the **Great Sage, Great Enlightener, and Filial Emperor of the Xióngmíng Era**, who in the **Kǐhài year of the Kaiyuan reign** (729 CE) issued imperial annotations and commentaries.\n\n**Dù Guāngtíng**—the **Broad Virtue Master of Later Shu**, titled **Guāngdé**, who in the **Xīnyǒu year of the Tiānfù era** (907 CE) composed the *Guangsheng Yi* (广圣义).\n\n**Emperor Dàojūn of the Song**—the **Enlightened Emperor, Filial Emperor of the Xióngmíng Era, and Benevolent Emperor of the Shèngwén Era**, whose given name was **Huīzōng**, titled **Bodily Unity with the Dao, Noble and Resolute in Virtue, Filial Emperor of the Xióngmíng Era, Benevolent Emperor of the Shèngwén Era, and Displaying Filial Piety**, who issued imperial annotations.\n\n**Wáng Jièfǔ**—the **Song Chancellor of Jīngguó, Grand Duke Wén**, whose given name was **Ānshí**, and whose courtesy name was **Jièfǔ**, who composed annotations.\n\n**Sū Yǐngbīn**—the **Song Grand Duke of the Middle and Outer Offices, Attendant Lord of the Imperial Household**, whose given name was **Zhì**, and whose courtesy name was **Zǐyóu**, who in the **Gēngchén year of the Yuánsù era** (1100 CE) composed annotations.\n\n**Lǚ Jìfǔ**—the **Song Scholar of the Guānwén Hall, Prefect of Líquán Guān**, whose given name was **Huìqīng**, who composed elucidations.\n\n**Lù Nóngshī**—the **Song Official of the Middle Rank, Governor of Bózhōu**, whose given name was **Diàn**, who composed elucidations.\n\n**Wáng Yuánzé**—the **Song Chancellor of the Lóngtú Hall, Direct Scholar, and Left Grand Duke of the Censorate, Earl of Línchuān**, whose given name was **Páng**, who composed elucidations.\n\n**Liú Zhòngpíng**—a **Song official**, who composed elucidations.\n\n**Liú Jùjì**—the **Song Official of the Zhífāng Bureau**, whose given name was **Jīng**, who composed elucidations.\n\n**The Chancellor’s New Explanation**—found within the *Bāzhù* (Eight Annotations), yet his name is not recorded.\n\n**Liú Jì**—known as **Qīngyuán Zǐ**, who in the **Bǐngyín year of the Shàoxīng era** (1166 CE) composed elucidations.\n\n**Zhào Shí’ān**—the **Treasure of Purity, Bǎoyuán Master**, residing as the **Attendant of Fúshān Yùxū Guān**, granted the purple robe and the character **Míngjǔ**, whose given name was **Dàoshēng**, who in the **Rénshēn year of the Shàoxīng era** (1192 CE) composed elucidations.\n\n**Shào Ruòyú**—known as **Běnlái Zǐ**, who in the **Jǐmǎo year of the Shàoxīng era** (1169 CE) composed elucidations.\n\n**Wáng Zhìrán**—known as **Jiàndú Dàshī**, who in the **Jǐchǒu year of the Qiándào era** (1199 CE) composed elucidations.\n\n**Chéng Tàizhī**—the **Song Grand Duke of the Lìbù, Chancellor of the Lóngtú Hall, and Grand Duke Wén**, whose given name was **Dàchāng**, who in the **Jǐchǒu year of the Qiándào era** (1199 CE) composed *Yìlǎo Tōngyán* (易老通言).\n\n**Huáng Màocái**—the **Song Governor of Jīngmén Military Affairs**, who in the **Jiǎwǔ year of the Chúnxī era** (1174 CE) composed elucidations.\n\n**Zhū Zǐyáng**—Song Grand Tutor **Huíguó Wén Gōng**, whose given name was **Xī**, with the courtesy name **Yuánhuì**.

He served as the Keeper of the Royal Archives in Zhou. When Confucius visited Zhou and sought to inquire about rites from Old Master, the latter replied: ‘What you speak of—both the man and his bones—have long since decayed, yet his words remain. Moreover, a noble one, when the time is right, rides in a carriage; when the time is not, he travels in a humble cart. I have heard: a skilled merchant probes hidden treasures as if they were empty; a virtuous sage, though his power is great, appears as though foolish. This is all I have to tell you.’\n\nConfucius departed and said to his disciples: ‘I know how birds fly, how fish swim, how beasts run. Those that run may be ensnared, those that swim may be hooked, those that fly may be struck with arrows. But as for the dragon—I cannot know how it rides the winds and clouds to ascend to heaven. Today, I have seen Old Master—he is like the dragon!’\n\nOld Master cultivated virtue and the Dao, devoting himself to obscurity and namelessness. After long residence in Zhou, seeing its decline, he departed westward. At the Pass, the Gatekeeper Yín Xǐ said: ‘Master, you are about to withdraw. Please write a book for me.’ Thus Old Master composed the *Dàodéjīng* in two sections, expounding the meaning of virtue and the Dao in over five thousand words, and then departed—none knew his ultimate fate.\n\nLater texts state: Old Master lived to over a hundred and sixty, or perhaps over two hundred, due to his cultivation of the Dao and longevity. One hundred and twenty-nine years after Confucius’ death, the Zhou Grand Historian Xiān saw Qin Xiàn Gōng and said: ‘When Qin first separated from Zhou, it will reunite after five hundred years, and after seventy years of unity, a sovereign ruler will arise.’ Some say this ‘Xiān’ was Old Master; others deny it—none know for certain. Old Master was a hidden sage.\n\nOld Master’s son was named Zōng, who served as a general for Wèi and was ennobled at Duàngān. Zōng’s son was Zhù, Zhù’s son was Gōng, and Gōng’s great-grandson Jiǎ served under Emperor Wén of Hàn. Jiǎ’s son Jiě became the Grand Tutor to the King of Jiāoxī, and the family settled in Qí. Those who studied Old Master disparaged Confucian learning, and Confucian scholars likewise disparaged Old Master. ‘Different paths do not conspire together’—is this not so?\"\n\n---\n\n**Ge Xianweng’s Preface:**\n\n*\"Old Master’s essence is the spontaneous unfolding of Nature itself. Born before the Primordial Void, arising without cause, traversing the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth—unfathomable, without termination, without limit, without extremity. Thus, without extremity, he aligns with the Great Dao to transform and give birth to Heaven and Earth, establishing roots and dispersing qi across the Ten Directions. Embracing the purest essence of virtue and the Dao, vast and boundless, beyond naming. Resplendent with its patterns, majestic in its achievements, profound beyond measure, august as the sovereign of the numinous. The Three Lights shine by its radiance; Heaven and Earth draw life from it; the Celestial Stems and Terrestrial Branches emit their essence through it. Lofty yet without subjects, noble yet without rank, encompassing without end—it teaches the Eight Directions of the heavenly hosts, universally propagating the Great Dao. Before the opening of creation, it descended to become the national teacher, generation after generation without cease. None can fathom its craftsmanship in forming the myriad things; it does not claim credit for its mysterious virtue. Thus, all sages revere it in common.\n\nThe Dao is honored, virtue is exalted—yet none commands it, for it is ever naturally so. Only Old Master embodies this.\n\nIn the Zhou era, it was said that the divine Li Mother gave birth to him by splitting her left armpit, and he emerged radiant, thus named Old Master. The title ‘Old Master’ arose from the Mysterious, existing before Heaven and Earth, beyond the bounds of decay and aging—hence the name. Though the world supposes Old Master originated in the Zhou, his title began in countless eons past, profound and obscure, distant beyond measure.\n\nAs the Dao declined and was not practiced, Old Master traveled westward across the world. At the Pass, Gatekeeper Yín Xǐ said: ‘The Great Dao is about to withdraw—please write a book for me.’ Thus he composed the *Dàodé* in two sections, five thousand words, as the upper and lower scriptures.\n\nThese five thousand words expound the source of virtue and the Dao, encompassing the great without omission, the minute without exclusion—the natural scripture of Heaven and humanity. My former master said: ‘If one diligently studies it, the voice harmonizes with the Supreme Ultimate, ascending in distant chant. The celestial hosts rejoice and invite the Mysterious Adepts. In quiet contemplation, seeking the True, all wonders converge. Observing form and shadow within, the spirit-qi endures eternally. Aligning with virtue and the Dao, all spirits submit; calamity vanishes from the Nine Shades, blessings arise in the Ten Directions, the nation is secure, the family is at peace—who can know this?\n\nThe text of *Wuwei* is not defiled by stagnation, nor adorned by glory, nor corrupted by obstruction, nor purified by clarity—it is natural. It manifests in response to the Dao, its teaching endless, its constancy unchanging. Thus, knowing constancy is enlightenment.\n\nWhat does the Great Dao accomplish? Its propagation depends on humanity. This sublime tradition—how can one not study it with utmost precision? A rough draft is offered here; only those of the Dao will treasure it. This section is not yet pure, yet preserved due to its long transmission.\"\n\n---\n\n**Tang Emperor Xuānzōng’s Imperial Preface:**\n\n*\"Old Master was the inner title of the Supreme Primordial Emperor of the Dao. The Primordial Ancestor of the Dao descended and was born in Yí. Reverent and august, he commanded the clan name ‘Táng.’ His blessings extended without bound, his auspices far-reaching, his lineage unbroken like the gourd-vine. His traces of departure and return are fully recorded in the annals.\n\nThe Daoist tradition holds he was the Morning Pearl of Jade; Sima Qian called him a hidden sage. Yet Confucius took him as teacher, and in the *Analects*, he sighed at the dragon-like virtue of Old Master—thus, Confucius held no reservations.\n\nAfter long service in the Zhou court, he prepared to enlighten the western reaches, and Gatekeeper Yín Xǐ requested he write a book.\"*\n\nThus, he expounded two chapters, elucidating the origin of **Dao** and **virtue** in nurturing life. Nothing escapes this principle.\n\nIts essence lies in **governing the self and governing the state**.\nTo govern the state, one must abandon arrogance and ostentation, embracing **non-action** and **non-speech** as doctrine;\nTo govern the self, one must minimize private desires, striving for **emptiness of heart** and **fullness of belly** as primary concerns.\nWhen comparing its grand intent, its meaning may be articulated.\n\nYet when delving into **exhausting principles and perfecting nature**, severing attachments and stilling thoughts, abiding in reality while practicing flexibility, attaining **sitting-forgetfulness** and discarding illumination—**reducing further, refining further**, reaching the **mystic yet deeper**—this is indeed beyond articulation or transmission.\n\nIts teachings are **circular**, its text **concise**, its intent **unobstructed**, its words **universal**; thus, those who wander its halls all deem themselves to have ascended to the chamber and glimpsed its depths.\nYet upon meticulous study and profound contemplation, they then realize that even at the finest hair’s end, they have not grasped even a ten-thousandth part of it.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\n*\"There exists a primal unity, born before Heaven and Earth.\nI know not its name; I call it Dao.\nForced to name it, I call it Great.\nThus, those who know the Great Dao grasp its **ultimate emptiness** and **mystic origin**—this is the forced name for its universal generation.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"At the beginning, there was the Non-being.\nThe Non-being—this is to say, the being is compared to the ineffable Non-being.*\nAgain, it says:\n*The Non-being has no name.\nThe unnamed—this is before any forced naming.*\nThus, the *Classic* says:\n*The Unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe forced name for universal generation is Dao.*\nThus, the *Classic* says:\n*The Named is the mother of all things.*\nAgain, *Zhuangzi* says:\n*When things obtain life, this is called virtue.*\nVirtue—this is *obtaining*.\nSpeaking of Heaven and Earth’s myriad transformations and boundless reach, all things draw upon the **mystic origin** to take form and be born; obtaining life is virtue.\nThus, the *Classic* says:\n*The Dao generates it; virtue nurtures it.*\nThen, those who know the Dao embody virtue, and virtue is the manifestation of the Dao.\nYet the *Classic* divides into upper and lower sections, first clarifying Dao and then virtue.\nHowever, though the names of *body* and *function* may be separated, their essence cannot be divided.\nThus, the *Classic* says:\n*Same origin, differing names—this is called the Mystic.\nSpeaking of its origin, it splits into two; speaking of its unity, it merges as one.\nThus, it is said: separable in name, inseparable in essence.*\n\nThen, the *Upper Classic* says: *This is called Mystic Virtue*, again: *The vastness of virtue’s capacity*, again: *Virtue aligns with virtue*, again: *Constant virtue never departs.*\nThe *Lower Classic* says: *Only when Dao is lost does virtue arise*, again: *Return is the movement of Dao*, again: *Dao generates the One*, again: *The Great Dao is most easy.*\nThus, it is known that *body* and *function* alternate in exposition, each elucidating the core essence, without rigidly fixing their names to upper or lower sections.\n\n*Classic*—this is the **direct path**, also the **constant way**, speaking of the Dao that universally traverses the direct and the enduring.\n\nEach time I reflect upon the sacred ancestor’s teachings, bequeathed to his descendants for contemplation, in moments of rest from governance, I humbly devoted myself to its study.\nNow, I further elucidate its essential mysteries in brief, for the written word cannot exhaust speech; I roughly outline the grand framework to aid those who seek.\n\nDu Guangting’s Preface to *Zhūtāo Yùzhé* states:\nThe **Supreme Primordial Lord** descended and manifested his teachings in four stages, far and near.\n\nThe first: across countless eons, he assumed forms and adapted his transformations according to the age, encompassing the thousand-two-hundred titles and one-hundred-eighty names scattered throughout the scriptures, which may be verified.\n\nThe second: at the dawn of the Kaihuang era of this eon, he fulfilled the cosmic function, nurturing Heaven and Earth, gestating the sun and moon as the foundation of transformation, the root of Heaven and Earth. He dispersed **qi** and partitioned light, generating all things. From the first of the Five Sovereigns to before the Yin and Shang dynasties, he served as the teacher of emperors, appearing in each generation—such as **Yùhuá, Lǜtú, Guǎngchéng, and Yínshòu**, who revealed his presence through the times.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns passed, the Five Emperors did not return; the **Dragon Sage of the Cloud Records** shifted with the ages, his steps varying—**Yàotáng** grew weary of his position in old age, **Yúshùn** endured trials before ascending to rule. He governed the myriad lands, diligently attending to all affairs.\n\nOld Lord was named **Yínshòu’s son**, residing in **Héyáng**, and transmitted the *True Classic of Dao and Virtue* to **Shùn**. This was the intent of the scripture.\nDao takes precedence in **non-action**; virtue follows in **having a name**.\nThis is also why the books of the Three Sovereigns speak of the **Great Dao**, while those of the Five Emperors speak of the **Constant Dao**.\n\nBelow this, he trimmed excessive rituals, combined the **love-extending** principle, reduced **bowing and deferential etiquette**, curbed **sharp cleverness**, rejected **military violence**, and suppressed **deceptive schemes**, guiding people back to **primordial simplicity and purity**, treating **non-action** as the ultimate governance.\n\nShùn had to exert force to implement this, exiling the wicked and appointing ministers, sharpening his senses, harmonizing the nine clans, and clarifying the people’s affairs—yet the **serene and pure Dao** could not be fully realized.\n\nThus, after **Yǔ and Tāng**, the world became a family possession, each cherishing their own kin. The Great Dao having faded, the **mystic transformation** no longer flowed; rituals and music grew elaborate, and laws and punishments were widely applied.\n\nThe third: the Lord descended as a divine manifestation during the **Xīnzhāo era of the Shang**, taking form in the year of **Wǔdīng**, born in **Bó**—today’s **Zhēnyuán County’s Jiǔlóngjǐng, Tàiqīng Palace**. Sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed, he subtly transformed the myriad lands. In the **Gengchǒu year of King Zhāo of Zhou**, he transmitted these two classics to **Emperor Yín Xǐ**, spreading them across the world, so that all could hear of them.\n\nThe fourth: he prepared to transform the **Western Wastes**, meeting **Emperor Yín Xǐ** at the **Qīngyáng Market in western Shǔ** to manifest his birth—this was the **Dīnsì year of King Zhāo**. This is the *Dao De Jing* transmitted from **Hánguān Pass**, revered and practiced across generations. Wise emperors and learned scholars have annotated and elucidated it in over sixty schools, including:\n\nThe *Jiejie* [解决]—upper and lower—was expounded by **Laozi** and **Yin Xi**.\n\nThe *Neijie* [内解]—upper and lower—was annotated by **Yin Xi** with the principles of inner cultivation.\n\nThe *Xiang Er* [想尔]—two volumes—was annotated by **San Tian Master Zhang Daoling**.\n\n**He Shang Gong’s** *Zhangju* [章句] descended to the banks of the **Han River** in **Shaan State** during the reign of **Emperor Wen of Han**; his temple remains today.\n\n**Yan Junping’s** *Zhǐguī* [指归]—fourteen volumes—was written by **Yan Zun**, a native of **Shu** during the reign of **Emperor Wu of Han**.\n\n**Shanyang Wang Bi**, styled **Fu Si**, served as **Shangshu Lang** in the **Wei** dynasty and annotated the text.\n\n**Nanyang He Yan**, styled **Ping Shu**, was a **Wei** **Duli Duyue**.\n\n**Hénán Guó Xiàng**, styled **Zǐ Xuán**, was a disciple of **Xiang Xiu** and lived in the **Wei-Jin**

volumes.\n\n**Gōng Fǎshī** wrote the *Jíjiě* [集解] in four volumes.\n\nThus, the commentaries are now widely expounded.\n\nThe interpretations vary among schools—some delve deeply into **Zhōngxuān** [重玄], avoiding entanglement in **kōngyǒu** [空有]; others indulge in **yīnyuán** [因果], rigidly adhering to **sāngshēng** [三生]; some align with **Rú** teachings, while others seek **xūjìng** [虚寂].\n\nAll have explored the **Líshì** [骊室], plucked the **zhūjī** [珠玑], ascended **Zhōngshān** [钟山], and contended to gaze upon the **guīdàn** [圭瓒]. With treasures in hand, they illuminate my mind.\n\nWhen expounding **inner cultivation**, the **Bāyù Yùxuě** [八玉] shines like mist in the **Dāntián**, and the **Jiǔ Zhuǎn Lánggāo** [九转琅玕] glows in the **Jiànguò**—mastering the subtleties of the **Liùqì** [六气] and achieving the **Wǔlíng Jiāfú** [五灵夹辅]. Forgetting forgetfulness, exhaling exhalation, attaining **wúdé** [无得] while comprehending **Huàyuán** [化元].\n\nWhen discussing **verification of categories**, they cast off fine dust, transcend the highest ranks, roam beyond the **Bāwài** [八外], and soar above the **Sānjìng** [三境], fulfilling the **Tàiyī** [太一]’s mandate.\n\nYet none surpass in combining **inner and outer essences**, merging **human and celestial capacities**.\n\nThe **Emperor Zhāngshù Xiàohuáng of the Mysterious Sovereign Dao** [我玄宗至道昭肃孝皇帝],\ndescended as a **Dragon in human form** [降神龙变],\ninherited the **Symbolic Mandate** [接统象先],\nsuppressed the **internal chaos** by harnessing the **Heavenly Stem** [乾], and\ninitiated the **Mid-Dynasty Revival**, ascending to the throne [御极].\n\nFor **forty-five years**, he governed with **Wuwei in its utmost flexibility** [无为在宥],\nleaving no trace of toil upon **Fénshuǐ** [汾水] and **Shàngchéng** [襄城].\nHe gathered **Zhūcí** [具茨] and **Dàwěi** [大隗],\nand found companions in his **wandering** [朋游].\nHe expanded the **Eight Seas** [八溟] into the **Renshou Palace** [仁寿之庭],\nand embraced the **Ten Thousand Houses** [万寓] as the realm of **Huàxiū** [华胥].\nHis **Dao** and **virtue** were supreme and luminous—\nexalted and clear beyond compare [超哉明哉].\n\nRevered as **precious as the sacred scriptures** [钦若尊经],\nhis teachings became the **foundation of the imperial household** [本朝家教].\nNo **ritual chants** [象击] could match his discourse,\nnor **Ode poetry** [风雅] suffice to enumerate his achievements.\nHe stood **transcendent across ages** [横亘古今],\n**self-sufficient within the cosmos** [独立宇宙].\n\nThough all scholars wielded their brushes yet failed to exhaust the **multifarious wonders** [众妙之门],\nnor did many a learned man penetrate the **profound depths of Chongxuan** [重玄之境].\nWith **leisure to refine his adornments** [凝旒多暇],\nand **thoughts converging in purpose** [属想有归],\nhe personally composed **eighty-one chapters** [躬注八十一章]\nand drafted **six volumes of commentary** [制疏六卷].\n\nWithin, he traced the **principles of the body’s foundation** [循身之本],\nand **encompassed all without omission** [囊括无遗].\nWithout, he articulated the **methods of governing the realm** [理国之方],\nand **exhaustively detailed every thread** [洪纤毕举].\n\nHis **imperial compositions** [宸藻] spread far and wide,\nsurpassing the **Five Clouds’ splendor** [夺五云之华],\nwhile **heavenly radiance** [天光] descended upon him,\nenhancing the **luster of the Two Illuminations** [增两曜之色].\n\nIndeed, he could rival **Zhì Zhòng’s *Ten Wings*** [季仲《十翼》],\nand **illuminate alongside *The Two Souths*** [辉映《二南》].\nHad he **personally received instruction from Xuānyuán** [玄元],\nor **truly transmitted the teachings of Tàishàng** [太上],\nhe would have **led all nine schools** [冠九流],\nand **emerged first among them** [首出],\nleaving an **enduring legacy across the ages** [垂万古而不刊].\nThen the **songs of *The Great Wind*** [《大风》] and **the *Red Wild Goose*** [《朱雁》] would **truly be unmatched**;\nand the **works of *Discourses on Literature*** [《典论》] and **the *Golden Tower*** [《金楼》] could **never be compared** to his.\n\nYet within his **commentaries and annotations** [疏注],\nhe **cited scriptures and harmonized their meanings** [引经合义],\nand in the **Chronicles of Zhou** [周书] and **Ru’s Histories** [鲁史],\nhe **mutually illuminated their insights** [互有发明].\nFrom the **Four Beginnings** [四始] to **Qī Yuán’s Garden** [漆园],\nhe **expounded their categories** [或申属类].\nLater scholars, upon unfolding his scrolls,\noften **blindly followed their sources** [瞢本源],\nand **pieced together from myriad texts** [探摭众书],\n**delving into their passages** [研寻篇轴].\nYet all who **followed their own observations** [随有所见]\n**found his works complete and exhaustive** [咸得备书],\nthus compiling the **Thirty-Volume *Comprehensive Sacred Teachings*** [纂成《广圣义》三十卷].\n\nThe **Great Brightness** [大明] shone above,\nyet his **flame of enlightenment** [爝火] never ceased;\nthe **Great Flood** [巨泽] spread across the heavens,\nyet his **transformative influence** [灌浸] never waned.\n\nThe truth is, my understanding is limited, and my annotations are crude and incomplete.\nIn the first year of the **Heavenly Restoration** [天复], on the sixteenth day of the ninth month, **Dragon Gathering** [龙集], on the day **Sin-Wei** [辛酉], **Jia-Zi** [甲子] was the sequence.\n**Su Yìngbīn’s Preface** [苏颖滨序]\n\nAt the age of forty-two, I was exiled to **Jùn Prefecture** [筠州].\nThough Jùn was a small prefecture, it housed many ancient **chan monasteries** [禅剎], where monks from all directions gathered.\nThere was a **Daoist Master Quán** [道全] residing at **Huángbì Mountain** [黄蘗山], the grandson of **Nán Gōng** [南公].\nHis conduct was lofty, and his mind was open; he took pleasure in conversing with me.\nOnce, he spoke with me of the **Dao/Way**, and I told him:\n*\"What you speak of, I have already found in the Confucian classics.\"*\n\nMaster Quán replied:\n*\"This is the **Buddha-Dharma**; how could a Confucian have attained it?\"*\n\nI said:\n*\"No, that is not so.\nI have indeed heard of the **Dao/Way**—what a Confucian lacks, why forcefully ascribe it to them?\nYet it truly exists, though the world knows it not.\nThe separation between **Confucianism** and **Buddhism** is like the incomprehension between **Hán** and **Hú** [胡].\nHow could you know otherwise?\"*\n\nMaster Quán said:\n*\"Then speak to me of its essence.\"*\n\nI said:\n*\"Confucius’ grandson, **Zǐsī** [子思], wrote *The Doctrine of the Mean* [《中庸》], which states:\n*'When **joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure** have not yet arisen, this is called **the Middle** [中].\nWhen they arise and are all in due measure, this is called **Harmony** [和].\n**The Middle** is the great root of all under heaven.\n**Harmony** is the universal **Dao/Way** of all under heaven.\nTo attain **the Middle and Harmony**, the heavens and earth find their place, and all things are nurtured thereby.'*\n\nHow does this accord?\nI said:\n*'The **Sixth Patriarch** [六祖] spoke: *\"Do not ponder goodness, do not ponder evil—this is your original face.\"\nSince the Sixth Patriarch, many have attained enlightenment through these words.\nWhat is meant by *not pondering goodness or evil* is the state before **joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure** arise.\n**The Middle** is another name for **Buddha-nature** [佛性], while **Harmony** encompasses the **Six Perfections** and **ten thousand practices** [六度万行].\nTo attain the utmost **Middle and Harmony**, and thus give rise to the heavens, earth, and all things—what **Buddha-Dharma** could surpass this?'*\n\nMaster Quán, delighted, exclaimed:\n*\"I did not know this before! Now I understand that **Confucianism and Buddhism** are one **Dharma**.\"*\n\nI laughed and said:\n*\"No, that is not so.\nThere is but **one Dao/Way** under heaven, yet the means of governing people differ.\nBetween **sovereign and minister, father and son**, without **rites and laws**, there is chaos.\nTo know **rites and laws** yet not the **Dao/Way** is the failing of vulgar Confucians, unworthy of esteem.\nTo dwell in the mountains and forests, eating grain and drinking from streams, yet harboring the **Supreme Dao/Way**, one may become a teacher to both **humans and celestial beings**—yet to govern the world with this would bring disorder.\nThe ancient **Sages** held the **Dao/Way** in their hearts and practiced it, yet did not reject the laws of the world—only then could they be so.\"*\n\nMaster Quán bowed in reverence, saying:\n*\"This is profound discourse indeed.\"*\n\nAt that time, I was studying the *Laozi*, and whenever I expounded a chapter, I showed it to Master Quán.\nHe would always exclaim:\n*\"All of this is the **Buddha’s teaching**!\"*\n\nI resided in Jùn for five years before returning north; Master Quán soon passed away.\nNow, more than twenty years have passed.\nWhenever I revised my *Commentary on the Laozi*, it never failed to align with the **Buddha-Dharma**.\nSince no one else could converse with me on this, I longed to see Master Quán again and show it to him.\nThus, I inscribed this at the end of the *Laozi*.\n\nIn the second year of **Great Observation** [大观], on the tenth day of the twelfth month, **Zǐyóu** [子由] inscribed this.\n\nIn my youth, when I was exiled to **Hǎikāng** [海康], I encountered my elder brother **Zǐzhān** [子瞻] by chance in **Téng Prefecture** [藤州].\nWe traveled together for over ten days, discussing our past studies.\nZǐzhān said to me:\n*\"Your works on *Poetry*, the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, and *Ancient History* are all beyond what ancient scholars achieved.\nOnly your *Commentary on the Laozi* falls slightly short.\"*\n\nUpon arriving in Hǎikāng, with leisure and no other duties, I revised all my writings.\nI then recopied the *Laozi* commentary and sent it to Zǐzhān.\nAfterward, by imperial favor, I returned north.\nZǐzhān fell ill in **Pílíng** [毗陵] and did not recover.\nNow, over ten years have passed, and I still do not know whether he approved of this book.\n\nIn the winter of the first year of **Political Harmony** [政和], I received from my nephew **Mài** [迈] and others the compilation of *My Late Father’s Writings* [《先公手泽》].\nAmong them was this:\n*\"Yesterday, Zǐyóu sent me *The New Commentary on the Laozi*.\nI read it through in one sitting and, closing the volume, sighed deeply.\nIf this book had existed in the **Warring States**, there would have been no **Shāng Yáng** or **Hán Fēi**.\nIf it had existed in the **Han’s early years**, **Kǒng** and **Lǎo** would have been one.\"*\n\nIf the **Jìn-Sòng** era had possessed this book, then **Buddha and Lao** would not have been two.\n\nLittle did I expect that in my old age I would encounter such singular brilliance—only then did I realize this book must have pleased **Zǐzhān**.\n\nYet in my ten years residing in **Topless Creek** [顽川], I further revised these four books.\nFor the words of the Sage are not fully grasped in a single reading; thus, whenever I gained new insight, I dared not treat my earlier interpretations as final.\nToday, I have added to my old age, and I consider myself content.\n\nI wished to consult **Zǐzhān** further, but it was impossible—so here, I weep and sigh.\n\n**Zhào Shí’s Preface:**\n\nThe **Húnchéng** [混成] essence is veiled in **silent stillness**.\nThe daily practice centers on the **Qi-Mother** [气母].\nAbove form, it transcends the **None**—the **None** is where all is hidden and nonexistent.\nBelow, it follows the **Law** and embraces the **Having**—the **Having** is where all is balanced and coexistent.\nTo guard well is to secure the **land of no-death**; to grasp **One** is to pierce the **divine mechanism**.\n\nOriginally, there is no preference—those who emulate form are like the **Unslaughtered** [不宰], who claim no action.\n**Creation’s work** is naturally bestowed; its operation through the ten thousand things makes the **Dao** neither approach nor depart.\nThe **Mandate of Heaven** is called the **Divine Vessel**, yet it cannot be seized—its attainment lies within oneself, and its **virtue** may be **rén** or **yì**.\n\nTo assist the world, one must value **purity and clarity**, yet it cannot be swayed.\nThe **Dao** is not difficult—seek it simply, and you attain the **mystery of the rare and subtle**, where divine transformations are unfathomable.\nThe **Dao** is not easy—delve into its **silent depths**, flowing into the realms of **movement and stillness**; its truth is both revealed and concealed, thus the **Two** merge into **One**, observable as such.\n\nThough **family and state** follow divergent paths, they should align in **unified principle**.\nIndeed, these two chapters establish the **foundation of virtue and power**, their **ninefold divisions** mirroring the **six yang essences**.\nRefining the **pure yin** in the **furnace of fire**, the **Heavenly Dao** blends—thus the world rests in **non-action**, and the **Sage-ruler** takes it as model.\n\nDoes it not say in the **Classics**:\n*\"He who attains the Dao rules as **Emperor above**, and as **King below**;\nHe who loses the Dao is seen as **light above**, and as **soil below**.\"*\n\nTo comprehend this **Dao**, one must do so with the **heart**.\nTo pierce the **true womb** is to err in **artifice**.\nIf such is the case, then what should one uphold?\n**Serene and unadorned**, it comes without seeking.\nWhat should one attain?\n**Action and conduct** follow without being summoned.\n\nThe **Ancient Sovereigns** governed the world without knowing the **Dao**—thus the **Dao** was **non-action**.\nIn the **declining Zhou**, they skillfully guided the world, yet the **Dao** was unknown—**rén** and **yì** could not be shifted.\nThis is why my teacher entrusted it to **Yīn Jūn**, and **Zhuāng and Liè** further illuminated it for the age.\n\nThough **rén** and **yì** can govern the world, the world’s disorder lies in their **infrequency**.\nThough **virtue and power** can harmonize the times, the times’ **hypocrisy** stems from their **neglect**.\nThe **highest and brightest Dao** thus resides with the **Sage**.\n\nThe **Middle Way** is never abandoned in this intent.\nThe **Upper Scripture** says:\n*\"What can be spoken of and named is not my constant Dao and constant Name.\"*\nThus, it is **hidden and difficult to discern**.\n\nIf one separates **superior virtue and superior righteousness**, distinguishing **non-action** from **action**, how could it be **reckless and unchecked**?\nThe **Three Sovereigns** skillfully employed it—**all day long, never departing**;\nThe **Five Emperors** could inherit it—**serving Heaven with distinction**.\nIn later ages, the **coarse and shallow** lost it through human failing.\n\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"The **Creative** is easy to know, the **Receptive** is simple to practice.\"*\nOnly by practicing the **simple and easy Dao** does one align with the **principle of pure clarity**.\n\nIf so, then how can there be **order and chaos** in governing the world?\n\nTruly, as **Gāigōng** said:\n*\"Governance values pure clarity*—this is the intent behind the **Two Chapters on Virtue and Power**.\"\n\nWritten on **Upper Element Day**, **Rénshēn Year** of **Shàoxīng** [绍兴], at the **Jùchán Hall**.\n**Huáng Mǎocái’s Preface**.\n\nThe Dao of Laozi sought to ride the clouds and qi, to ascend and bend the boundless,\nto gaze beyond the eight wilds, deeming human affairs unworthy to weigh upon his mind.\nYet now his text speaks much of governing the state and loving the people,\nof wielding armies and leading troops, descending even to the minutiae of carriages and tools—\nindeed, it is mostly metaphorical speech.\n\nLaozi and Zhuangzi are one. One knows Zhuangzi’s use of metaphor,\nyet does not know it originated from Laozi.\nThus, readers of *Laozi* often miss its true intent.\n*Laozi* says:\n*\"Know its masculine, hold to its feminine.\"*\nAgain:\n*\"The spirit of the Valley does not die—this is called the mysterious female.\"*\nAgain:\n*\"And yet, it prizes seeking nourishment from the Mother.\"*\nWhy does *Laozi* value the feminine, the female, and the Mother?\nAll are metaphorical speech.\nAmong the eighty-one chapters, such cases are not few—\nyet he wished to align with Confucius and Mencius’ Six Classics,\nso it was inevitable that their meanings would clash.\n\nI have pondered this text for many years,\ndevoted to exploring Laozi’s intent,\nand composed annotations to clarify it.\nWhere my understanding was incomplete,\nI drew upon *Liezi*, *Zhuangzi*, *Yijing*,\nand other Daoist writings,\nhoping to pierce the chaos of darkness,\nto dissect the vast and formless,\nso that those who come after may grasp its truth.\n\n**Xie Tunan’s Preface**:\nThe Dao has its scriptures, ancient in origin.\nBefore the union of the blue ox and purple breath,\nbefore the opening of the jade [□] and golden keys,\nthere were already the Five Thousand Words,\nrevealing the secrets of the Primordial,\nexpounding the subtle essence of the Fallen.\nMysterious beyond measure, divine beyond reckoning—\nonly those on the Dao can truly know it.\n\n*Laozi*’s eighty-one chapters,\nits words also numbering Five Thousand,\nare the continuation of its lineage,\nflowing together in harmony—\ntruly, all are the natural expression of the Dao.\nExtending it further,\none refines the self to govern the state,\ngoverns the state to pacify the world—\nand the Dao of governance is fulfilled.\nPursuing it deeper,\none refines the self to cultivate the spirit,\ncultivates the spirit to ascend—\nand the Dao of transcendence is fulfilled.\n\nZhang Ping’s verse says:\n*The *Yinshu* treasure exceeds three hundred,*\n*the *Daode*’s sacred words are but Five Thousand.*\n*Since ancient times, the divine and immortal are boundless,*\n*all spring from here, the true path revealed.*\nDid Ping deceive me?\nThough the *signs* are tools to catch fish,\nthe *scriptures* are paths to enter the Dao—\nfish caught, the *signs* may be forgotten;\nthe Dao understood, the *scriptures* are but temporary guides.\n\nTo recite the words of ancient sages\nyet fail to grasp their unspoken meaning\nis still of no benefit.\n\n*The Huangting Neijing* says:\n*\"The divine and immortal are not born with inherent spirit—*\n*they accumulate essence and amass merit to attain true reality.\"*\nAgain:\n*\"Accumulating merit to refine is not natural—*\n*it comes from devotion, from focus and perseverance.\"*\nThe Daoist scholar who devotes his heart\nto essence and focus, enduring without falter,\nhas never failed to succeed.\nYet he fears the reverence not reaching its peak,\nor arrogance and neglect taking hold,\nor faith not being steadfast,\nor carelessness following in its wake.\nThis is why, among a thousand, only one or two may attain it.\n\nIn antiquity, the Yellow Emperor received the *Yinshu*’s intent from Guangcheng Huangren,\nand wept in gratitude.\nGeneral Yan, the Keeper of the Pass, heard the marvels of *Daode* from Li Laojun,\nand wept in reverence, bowing.\nWhy did they weep?\nTheir joy and awe were profound, their gratitude intense.\nYet if this text is so difficult to see,\nand its meaning so hard to grasp,\nwe must bow a hundred times to recite it,\nguard it all our lives,\ntreasure it as the greatest of gems,\ncherish it as the Primordial Qi—\nlet us not neglect it,\nlet us not abandon it.\n\n**Yu Qiongzhong’s Second Preface**, written on **Upper Element Day**, **Renshen Year** of **Chunyu** [淳佑],\nat the **Lian Mountain Celestial Nectar Child**’s **Jingtai Hall**.\n\n**Yu Qingzhong’s Preface**:\nThe great source of the Dao arises from Heaven.\nHeaven cannot speak for itself,\nso it depends upon those who can speak to proclaim it,\nand only then does the Dao’s form emerge.\n\nIf there were no one to speak of it,\nthen the Dao would remain forever concealed.\nDoes Heaven wish the Dao to remain concealed forever?\nThose who can speak of it are rare—\none in a hundred ages.\nIf our Laozi is such a rare one,\nthen Heaven entrusted this Dao to his person.\nThe body is the Dao’s vessel.\nThe Dao is embodied in the person,\nand expressed in words—\nthus the secrets of Heaven and Earth are revealed,\nand the mechanisms of creation are disclosed.\n\nThen there are the *scriptures*,\nwhich record the words,\nand the words carry the Dao—\nthe Five Thousand Words are all the Dao.\nIn truth, they do not depart from one essence,\nscattered through the eighty-one chapters—\nall are the Dao.\nNor do they stray beyond this one essence—\nits refined aspects govern the heart,\nits coarse aspects govern the body,\nits earthly and mundane aspects govern the world and state—\nall stem from this single Dao’s extension.\n\nSince the rise of specialized schools,\neach upholds its own truths,\neach rejects its own falsehoods.\nZi Yun was scorned for his dismissal,\nBan Gu was criticized for his harshness—\nthus my *scripture* was long consigned\nto the ranks of the debased and the heretical,\nyet none considered that though the names of the Three Teachings differ,\ntheir principles are one.\n\nIn ancient times, Su Huangmen annotated this text\nand entrusted it to Dongpo.\nDongpo said:\n*\"Had this text existed in the Warring States,*\n*then there would have been no Shang Yang or Han Fei;*\n*had it existed at the beginning of the Han,*\n*then Confucius and Laozi would have been one;*\n*had it existed in the Jin-Song period,*\n*then Buddhism and Daoism would not have been two.\"*\nCould this not diminish the study of heresy?\n\nI admire the Celestial Dynasty,\nwhich honors and upholds sacred teachings,\nsupports and nurtures human order.\nAll Daoist writings were burned by imperial decree,\nyet the *Daode* alone stands firm,\nradiant in the world,\nlike the sun shining in Heaven—\nis this not Heaven’s will?\n\nThough the music of Zheng and Wei was discarded,\nthe *Shao* grew more revered;\nthough the tiles lay in ruins,\nthe pearls became more visible.\nHeaven’s intent is clear.\n\nHeaven did not conceal this Dao in the past,\nbut now reveals it grandly,\nwishing that this text be held by families,\nand its meaning grasped by people.\nYet all possess this text,\nyet few can speak of it,\nand even fewer can embody it in their hearts—\nwhat use are mere words?\n\n「For words are the means to convey meaning,\nand once meaning is grasped, words may be forgotten.\n\nHow many have recited or expounded upon it through the ages?\nHow many have annotated it from beginning to end?\nYet none could forget words—all failed in this.\n\nSome gained here but lost there,\nsome took its coarse aspects while neglecting its essence.\nIn the end, none could fully grasp the complete intent of one school,\nnor dispel the doubts of a thousand years.\n\nI, in humility, have taken what was already spoken,\nand sought to reveal what was not yet spoken,\nsupporting my arguments with authoritative *jing* and *zhuàn* texts,\ngrounding my discussions in the teachings of the scholars.\nI have thus titled it *Daode Jing Ji Yi* [《道德經集義》],\nnot daring to claim novelty from predecessors,\nfor the principles of the world are boundless—\nthe more one seeks, the more one finds.\nI wish that Master Lao could revive,\nand find no cause for regret.\n\nAs for the crime of presumption,\nI dare not evade it.\n\nAll who share my aspirations,\nexamine and refine this work,\nmust surely dream of the Blue Ox Master\nascending from the thousand-year past.\n\n*Daode Zhenjing Ji Yi* [《道德真經集義》] **Great Outline and Preface of the Collected Meanings**\n*Daode Zhenjing Ji Yi* [《道德真經集義》] **Central Volume of the Collected Meanings**」\n\nThe Venerable Master Yǒngyuǎn often resided at the Xuanmiao Guan of the Great Dao/Virtue Path, where the overseer of the Hall of the Moon, Liu Weiyong, compiled this work. The former Grand Secretary and acting Registrar of the Treasury Bureau, also an editor at the Secretariat, Ding Yidong of Shitan, and Du Guangting, undertook the interpretation of this *jing*.\n\nThe text is divided into two major sections:\nFirst, the *zhìcù* (制疏) is elucidated, then the main text is explained.\n\nNow, the origin of the *zhìcù* is recounted:\nIn the leisure of his reign, the Great Tang Emperor Xuanzong pondered the profound Dao/Virtue, recognizing it as the primordial root of heaven and earth. Master Lao, the Most August Ancestor of the Mysterious Origin, expounded upon the two *jing* texts, their teachings enduring across ages—originating from the time of Shun, transmitted through the Zhou dynasty, and annotated by over sixty scholars in commentaries and elucidations.\n\nWhen discussing governance, the teachings of the Yan family and the Duke of Lu, as well as Yang Xún’s personal insights, stand unparalleled. For personal cultivation, the *Songling* and *Xiang’er* traditions remain unmatched in their subtlety.\n\nAmong them, Emperor Wu of Liang, Emperor Jianwen, the monk Sengzhao, and the translators Luo Ran, Zang, Tao, and Gu, all flourished in the Southern Dynasties. Ren, Li, and the two Zhangs shone in Western Shu. Yet despite their contributions, some interpretations were flawed, and none fully penetrated the essence.\n\nThus, in the eleventh year of the Kaiyuan era, the Emperor personally annotated and elucidated the text. Having completed the account of the *zhìcù*, the explanation of the main text follows, divided into two parts: first, clarifying the *cù* (疏) title, and second, analyzing the text itself.\n\nThe subsequent exposition is structured into two major divisions of the *cù*:\nFirst, the opening chapter is interpreted, summarizing the overarching themes, further divided into two:\n1. The method of exposition—namely, the two characters *Dao* and *De*.\n2. The teaching that expounds it—the single character *jing*.\n\nThe full interpretation follows; distinctions within the *jing* title will be addressed later.\n\nThese two characters, *Dao* and *De*, encompass the origin of all things, the subtle principles of governing the state and cultivating oneself—all are contained herein.\n\nFormerly, the Daoist Master Ge Xuan addressed Sun Quan, ruler of Wu, saying:\n*The Daode Jing* is the utmost subtlety of heaven and earth. It encompasses the Dao/Virtue of heaven, the Dao/Virtue of humanity, and the Dao/Virtue of the divine. It is boundless in its scope, minute in its reach—worthy of reverence.\n\nWithin this framework, thirty-eight distinct teachings are outlined:\n\n1. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to govern through *wuwei* (無為):**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Abandon the Sage, discard wisdom—benefit to humanity is a hundredfold. Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness—humanity returns to filial piety and affection.\"*\n   *\"Abandon cleverness, discard profit—thieves and robbers will cease to exist.\"*\n   Again: *\"How can one love people and govern the state without *wuwei*?\"*\n   *\"I practice *wuwei*, yet people transform themselves.\"*\n\n2. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to cultivate the Dao/Virtue in the world:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Cultivate the Dao/Virtue in the world, and its power will be universal.\"*\n   *\"Hold fast to the ancient Dao to govern the present.\"*\n   *\"Hold fast to the Great Image, and all under heaven will follow.\"*\n\n3. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to govern with the Dao/Virtue:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Govern the world with the Dao/Virtue—its spirits will not be numinous. Not that its spirits are not numinous, but that they will not harm people.\"*\n   *\"When the Dao/Virtue is absent in the world, warhorses arise at the borders.\"*\n\n4. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to act in accordance with heaven:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Humanity follows the earth; the earth follows the heavens.\"*\n   *\"The Dao/Virtue constantly does nothing yet nothing remains undone. If lords and kings can uphold this, all things will transform of their own accord.\"*\n\n5. **Teaching the Son of Heaven not to disdain the world due to his exalted status:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Hold the body as precious as the world—thus it may be entrusted with the world. Love the body as precious as the world—thus it may be entrusted with the world.\"*\n   *\"How can one who rules a myriad chariots treat the world lightly? To treat it lightly is to lose ministers; to be hasty is to lose the mandate.\"*\n\n6. **Teaching the Son of Heaven not to exalt the worthy nor treasure wealth:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Do not exalt the worthy—thus people will not contend. Do not treasure difficult-to-obtain wealth—thus people will not become thieves.\"*\n   *\"Desire what is undesired; do not treasure difficult-to-obtain wealth.\"*\n\n7. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to transform people through *wuwei* and *wuyu* (無欲):**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Always keep people in a state of ignorance and desirelessness—thus the wise will not dare to act. To act in *wuwei* is to govern without fail.\"*\n   *\"I have no affairs, yet people prosper. I have no desires, yet people return to simplicity.\"*\n   *\"By desirelessness and stillness, the world will rectify itself.\"*\n\n8. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to view all things impartially and not be entangled in achievements:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Heaven and earth are not benevolent—they treat all things as fodder for the dogs. The Sage is not benevolent—they treat the people as fodder for the dogs.\"*\n   *\"Practice teaching without words.\"*\n   *\"Act without relying on it; when the deed is done, take no credit.\"*\n\n9. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to hold nothing fast nor be obstructed:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"To act is to ruin; to grasp is to lose.\"*\n   *\"Abandon excess, abandon extravagance, abandon excessiveness.\"*\n   *\"The Sage has no fixed heart—taking the hearts of the people as their own.\"*\n\n10. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to found governance on humility:**\n    The *jing* states: *\"The noble takes the lowly as root; the high takes the low as foundation.\"*\n    *\"The seas and rivers reign over all valleys because they excel in descending.\"*\n    *\"Bear the filth of the state—this is the master of the ancestral altars. Bear the misfortunes of the state—this is the king of the world.\"*\n    *\"Great states should act as the lowly. Thus they take the small states.\"*\n    *\"The good ruler employs people as the lowly.\"*\n\n11. **Teaching the feudal lords to govern rightly:**\n    The *jing* states: *\"Govern with rectitude.\"*\n    *\"To govern with wisdom is the ruin of the state. Not to govern with wisdom is the blessing of the state.\"*\n    *\"The difficulty of governing the people lies in their many clever schemes—thus they are difficult to govern.\"*\n\n12. **Teaching the feudal lords to avoid harsh and violent rule:**\n    The *jing* states: *\"To govern a great state is like poaching a small fish. The more the court is frequented, the more the fields lie fallow. The more the granaries are filled, the more the people suffer hunger.\"*\n\n「Again it states: *\"If his governance is meticulous, his people will be deficient.\"*」\n\n**13. Teaching the feudal lords to assist the sovereign with the Dao/Way and not to rely on military prowess:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"Assist the sovereign with the Dao/Way, do not use force of arms to dominate the world.\"*\n*\"Force of arms will not prevail.\"*\n*\"The good warrior conquers without contention.\"*\n*\"Though there be armor and weapons, there is no place to display them.\"*\n*\"Let people return to knotting cords and simple tools.\"*\n\n**14. Teaching the feudal lords to uphold the Dao/Way and transform the people:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"The ancients who excelled as gentlemen were subtle, mysterious, and profound in their understanding.\"*\n*\"If his governance is obscure, his people will be pure.\"*\n\n**15. Teaching the feudal lords not to trifle with arms or indulge in martial aggression:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"When using arms, one must say: 'I dare not be the aggressor, but only the defender; I dare not advance even an inch, but retreat even a foot.'*\n*\"He who resists arms with compassion will prevail.\"*\n*\"No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy.\"*\n*\"The good warrior does not rely on force.\"*\n*\"Drive away the unarmed, seize without weapons.\"*\n*\"The virtue of non-contention.\"*\n\n**16. Teaching the feudal lords not to indulge in licentiousness and extravagance, to lighten taxes and burdens, and to nourish the people:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"The people’s hunger arises from their rulers consuming too much in taxes—thus they starve.\"*\n*\"When the people are many in clever schemes, strange things flourish.\"*\n\n**17. Teaching the feudal lords not to display their advantageous weapons:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"Fish cannot be taken from the depths without harming the pool; a state possessing advantageous weapons should not display them to the people.\"*\n*\"The ancients who excelled in the Dao/Way did not seek to enlighten the people, but rather to keep them in simplicity.\"*\n\n**18. Teaching to govern the state and cultivate oneself, honoring the Three Treasures:**\nThe *jing* says: *\"I possess Three Treasures; preserve and uphold them.\nThe first is kindness, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to lead the world.\"*\n\n**19. Teaching to cultivate oneself, yielding to preserve wholeness, embracing softness to prevail:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"Yielding preserves wholeness.\"*\n*\"Softness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength.\"*\n*\"The soft and weak are the companions of life.\"*\n*\"The hard and strong are the companions of death.\"*\n*\"The overbearing will not meet their end.\"*\n\n**20. Teaching to govern oneself, acting without action and desiring without desire:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"Always without desire, observe its subtlety.\"*\n*\"See no desirable gain, and the heart will not be disturbed.\"*\n\n**21. Teaching to govern oneself, preserving the Dao and nurturing the *qi* to complete one’s life:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"Bring emptiness to its utmost, hold steadfastness with sincerity.\"*\n*\"Focus the *qi* to achieve softness.\"*\n*\"Feed the belly, not the eyes—discard the former, embrace the latter.\"*\n*\"Know its brilliance, guard its darkness.\"*\n*\"Know its male, guard its female.\"*\n*\"Continuous as if it exists, yet used without exhaustion.\"*\n\n**22. Teaching to govern oneself, elevating virtue and discarding vice:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises.\nWhen all under heaven know goodness as goodness, then evil arises.\"*\n*\"The consistently virtuous save people without abandoning anyone, save things without discarding anything.\"*\n*\"The virtuous person is the teacher of the non-virtuous.\"*\n*\"Dull their sharpness, untangle their confusion.\"*\n*\"The highest virtue is like water.\"*\n\n**23. Teaching to govern oneself, accumulating virtue as the foundation:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"The depth of virtue that is contained.\"*\n*\"The highest virtue is like the valley.\"*\n*\"The great man dwells in substance, not in superficiality, and resides in reality, not in ornament.\"*\n*\"The gentleman walks all day without straying from his essential burdens.\"*\n\n**24. Teaching to govern oneself, diligently applying the Dao/Way:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"The superior man, hearing the Dao/Way, is earnest and puts it into practice.\"*\n*\"Brave in not daring, he remains alive.\"*\n\n**25. Teaching to govern oneself, abandoning fame and achievement, not indulging in worldly learning:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"Abandon learning, and there will be no worries.\"*\n*\"When achievement and reputation are complete, withdraw from the world.\"*\n*\"Do not dwell on achievement.\"*\n*\"Practice the Dao/Way daily, diminishing it.\"*\n*\"Which is dearer: reputation or life?\"*\n\n**26. Teaching to govern oneself, not coveting worldly gain:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"Which is more: life or wealth? Which is more harmful: possession or loss?\"*\n*\"The more one cherishes, the greater the expenditure; the more one hoards, the greater the loss.\"*\n*\"Hard-to-obtain wealth causes one to act against propriety.\"*\n\n**27. Teaching to govern oneself, avoiding external entanglements and not flaunting one’s abilities:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"Not self-displaying, one becomes clear.\nNot self-praising, one has merit.\nNot self-exalting, one endures long.\"*\n*\"Great eloquence seems stammering; great skill seems clumsy.\"*\n*\"Ample virtue appears insufficient.\"*\n*\"Great sound is rare in tone.\"*\n*\"He who conquers himself is strong.\"*\n\n**28. Teaching to govern oneself, not seeking honor and favor:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"Honor and disgrace are like a sudden alarm.\"*\n*\"To grasp and fill is not as good as to let go.\nTo sharpen and whet cannot be long preserved.\"*\n*\"Riches and nobility with arrogance bring their own retribution.\"*\n\n**29. Teaching to govern oneself, having little knowledge and speaking cautiously:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"To know one’s ignorance is superior; to not know one’s knowledge is a disease.\"*\n*\"Much speech leads to exhaustion; better to hold to the middle.\"*\n*\"Light promises bring few trustworthy deeds; many changes bring many difficulties.\"*\n*\"Close its openings, shut its doors—then it will not weary throughout life.\"*\n\n**30. Teaching those who leave the world, the Dao/Way is the opposite of the common ways:**\nThe *jing* states: *\"The people are bright and clear, but I alone seem dull.\nThe people are meticulous, but I alone am obscure.\"*\n*\"Clarifying the Dao/Way seems like obscurity; advancing the Dao/Way seems like retreat.\"*\n\n**31. Teaching those who leave the world, to nourish the spirit and thus not die:***\nThe *jing* states: *\"Nourish the spirit, and it will not die.\"*\n\nThe *jing* states:\n*\"The spirit of the valley does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Feminine.\"*\n*\"Deep roots and firm foundations—\nthe Dao/Way of long life and enduring vision.\"*\n*\"Well-established, it cannot be uprooted;\nwell-embraced, it cannot slip away.\"*\n\n**32. Teaching one to preserve life, attaining longevity without perishing:**\nThe *jing* states:\n*\"To die yet not perish is longevity.\"*\n\n**33. Teaching one to cultivate the self, transcending the body through non-action:**\nThe *jing* states:\n*\"Place yourself behind your body, and your body will lead;\nTranscend your body, and your body will endure.\"*\n\n**34. Teaching one to regulate the heart, emptying the mind to align with the Dao/Way:**\nThe *jing* states:\n*\"Empty your mind,\nWeaken your will.\"*\n\n**35. Teaching one to conduct oneself in the world, harmonizing one’s brilliance with all things:**\nThe *jing* states:\n*\"Harmonize your light with the dust of the world.\"*\n*\"The Great Dao/Way is vast—\nhow can it be confined to left or right?\"*\n*\"Wearing coarse robes while cherishing jade.\"*\n\n**36. Teaching one to abandon excess desires, cultivating awe, caution, humility, and luminous virtue:**\nThe *jing* states:\n*\"The five colors blind the eyes;\nThe five tones deafen the ears;\nThe five flavors dull the palate;\nHunting and galloping make the heart deranged.\"*\n*\"If the people do not fear authority, then great terror will come.\"*\n\n**37. Teaching one to enrich the many and benefit the few:**\nThe *jing* states:\n*\"Use your abundance to supply what is lacking.\"*\n*\"The more you give to others, the more you possess;\nThe more you benefit others, the more you gain.\"*\n\n**38. Teaching one to embody the Dao/Way and cultivate the self, ensuring inevitable reward:**\nThe *jing* states:\n*\"Traveling on land, you do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers;\nEntering battle, you are unharmed by weapons.\"*\n*\"Because you dwell in the place of no death.\"*\n\nThese thirty-eight distinctions elucidate the *jing*’s profound teachings.\nYet this *jing* is vast—encompassing all without exclusion,\nand minute—penetrating to the finest hairs.\nThese thirty-eight gates do not exhaust its essence.\nTo preserve its doctrine, I broadly outline its core principles,\nyet even this is like comparing autumnal hairs to a millionth of their truth.\n\nThe *Rites of Zhou* states:\n*\"The Dao/Way is that which cannot be absent for a moment;\nwhat can be absent is not the Dao/Way.\"*\n\nIf a ruler lacks virtue/power,\nit is like gazing without two eyes.\nIf a minister lacks virtue/power,\nit is like a chest without five organs.\nIf a household lacks virtue/power,\nit is like a corpse without breath.\n\nThus, the Dao/Way is indispensable to humanity.\nIf one abandons spoken teachings and absolute silence,\nand points to the Mysterious Feminine beyond the Mysterious Feminine,\nthe subtlest of the subtle—\nthis can be illuminated by the spirit,\nyet cannot be conveyed by words.\nThis is the ultimate of the Dao/Way.\n\nWang Yuanze says:\n*\"The Dao/Way is one.\nYet its explanations are two.\"*\n\nWhat then are these two?\n\nOne is *wu* (無)—the root of the Dao/Way, the very essence of the subtle.\nThe other is *you* (有)—the manifestation of the Dao/Way, the expedient and practical.\n\nThus, the root of the Dao/Way emerges from the boundless void of the profound and obscure,\nwhile its manifestation disperses through the forms, names, measures, and numbers of the world.\nThese two, though one in essence,\nare often mistaken by the deluded as separate—why?\nBecause the boundless void and the profound obscure abide in *wu*,\nwhile forms, names, measures, and numbers abide in *you*.\nSince *wu* and *you* cannot coexist,\nthis is why the deluded fail to grasp their unity.\n\n*Wu* is named the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nwhile *you* is named the mother of all things.\nThough their names differ,\nthey never cease to serve one another.\nFor *wu* and *you* are like east and west—opposite yet inseparable.\nThus, without *you*, *wu* cannot be perceived,\nand without *wu*, *you* cannot emerge.\nThe interplay of *wu* and *you* alternates in succession,\nyet never departs from the Dao/Way—\nthis is what the sages call the *shen* (神, numinous).\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Without thought, without action,\nserene and unmoving,\nyet responsive and thus harmonizing with all under Heaven.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nOf old, the sages would observe the subtle constancy through their *wu* (無思無為),\nand perceive the expedient through their responsive harmony with all under Heaven.\nWhen both the subtle and the expedient are attained without partiality,\nwho but the numinous could comprehend this?\n\nThus, the Dao/Way of the sages is now revealed.\nTo observe the subtle is to fathom the numinous,\nwhile to observe the expedient is to know transformation.\nTo fathom the numinous and know transformation—\nwhat more could be added to the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth?\n\nYet, to observe the subtle is merely to fathom the numinous,\nnot to be the numinous itself.\nFor the numinous never departs from these two,\nnor are these two sufficient to be named.\nThus it is said: *\"The two share a source but differ in name.\nTheir unity lies in their origin from the numinous,\nwhile their difference lies in the names of *wu* and *you*.\"*\n\nThe sage embodies this and manifests virtue through the numinous,\nso dwelling in *wu* suffices to reveal the subtle,\nwhile dwelling in *you* suffices to know the expedient—\nyet ultimately transcending the names of *wu* and *you*.\nIn this, the highest knows the origin of Heaven and Earth,\nand the lowest responds to the beginning of all things—\nall through this.\n\nAh! The words of Laozi can be said to align with the *Yijing*.\nYet he ultimately cannot stand with Confucius and Mencius—why?\nBecause the sage, when speaking of the Dao/Way, never sought to articulate it.\nAll that was spoken of emerged in response to the transformations of the world,\nand was meant only for those of mediocre talent who could not comprehend on their own.\nThough the Dao/Way encompasses both *wu* and *you*,\nwhen spoken of, it emphasizes *you* while neglecting *wu*.\nFor the texts of the *Shijing*, *Shujing*, *Liji*, *Yueji*, and *Chunqiu*\nall serve to elucidate *you*.\nAs for *wu*, only the *Yijing* speaks of it—\nyet even then, its teachings are embedded in the lines, symbols, and judgments,\nin the auspicious and inauspicious, the regrets and cautions,\nso that the learned, observing from above, see the detailed particulars of things\nand grasp their *you*,\nwhile the unlearned, observing from below, perceive the transcendence of instruments and uses\nand grasp their *wu*.\nThus, the wise grow ever more confident in their understanding,\nwhile the foolish, though glimpsing it, do not fall into doubt or error.\n\nFor others have pondered: *\"The subtle Dao/Way is beyond the reach of mediocre minds.\nThose who can grasp it need not speak—it reveals itself.\nIf one fails to measure it thus and insists on speaking of the subtle,\nthen one only confuses the learners.\"*\n\nLaozi understood that *wu* and *you* serve one another,\nand that *wu* is the root, so his words elaborate on *wu* while omitting *you*.\nYet *wu* is beyond speech—how can it be elaborated upon?\nSince Laozi already diverged from Confucius and Mencius,\nRong Zhi further lost the essence of Confucius.\nFor he claimed that *wu* (無) is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nand that the *shen* (神) is the most difficult to name of Heaven and Earth—\nyet the world has already named it *shen*.\nBut is there truly anything without a name?\nAgain, he believed that one must observe the expedient through desire,\nyet great desire is the harm of nature.\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Restrain anger, suppress desire,\"*\nand Laozi also says: *\"Do not see what is desirable, lest the heart be disturbed.\"*\nIf desire exists, one will sink, stray, and lose oneself in pursuing things,\nunable to know what to hold onto—\nhow then can one observe the expedient?\nThis failure to discern leads him to say, *\"I know the completeness of Heaven and Earth,\nthe grand framework of the ancients\"*—\nalas, how laughable!\n\nLiu Zhongping said:\n*\"The constant name is *wu* (無方) as its essence,\nthe constant Dao/Way is *wu* (無體) as its function.\n*Wu* (無方) is without boundaries—nowhere is it not present;\n*wu* (無體) is without form—nothing is beyond its doing.\nIf there is anything it does, then it is not *wu* (無方);\nif there is anything it names, then it is not *wu* (無體).\nThus it is said: *‘The Dao/Way that can be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way;\nthe name that can be named is not the constant name.’*\n\nAt the beginning of the Great Origin, there was *wu* and *you*,\nand *wu* was without name.\nThat which was *wu* and without name—this was the Great Commencement.\nThe Great Commencement is the father of Heaven and Earth,\nso it is said: *‘The unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.’*\nHeaven and Earth are the mothers of all things,\nso it is said: *‘The named is the mother of all things.’*\nTo speak of the mother is to know the father of the beginning,\nwhile to speak of the beginning is to know the mother as the source of life.\nThus, above it is said: *‘the beginning of Heaven and Earth,’*\nand below it is said: *‘the mother of all things.’*\"*\n\n「Yet the principles of the world, there is the Dao/Way and the constant Dao/Way,\nthere is the name and the constant name.\n\nWhat is called *‘the Great Origin has wu and you’* is simply *wu*.\nWhat is called *‘wu has wu-ming’* is simply *you*-ming.\n\nFor indeed, there is *wu* and *you*, and thus there is the named *you*.\nHence, *wu-ming* is merely *‘the Great Origin of Heaven and Earth.’*\n\nBut above this, there is also the *zu* (祖).\nThe subtle (*miao* 妙) is the root of the Dao/Way,\nthe coarse (*jiao* 徼) is the end of the Dao/Way.\nThe sage’s subtlety, observing it with *constant wu*,\nthe sage’s coarseness, observing it with *constant you*.\n\nThus it is said: *‘Constant wu to observe its subtlety,\nconstant you to observe its coarseness.’*\nThe subtle lies within, the coarse without,\nspeaking of the subtle reveals the coarse as coarse,\nspeaking of the coarse reveals the subtle as within.\nHence, above it is said: *‘constant wu to observe its subtlety,’*\nand below it is said: *‘constant you to observe its coarseness.’*\n\nFor *wu* is *wu* opposed to *you*,\nwhile *constant wu* is not *wu* opposed to *wu*, nor is it *you* opposed to it;\n*you* opposed to *wu* is *you* that is not *wu*,\nwhile *constant you* is not *you* opposed to *you*, nor is it *wu* opposed to it.\nThat which is not *wu* opposed is not *you*,\nthat which is not *you* opposed is not *wu*.\nThus, *constant you* is the true *wu* in essence, yet not *wu*,\nand *constant wu* is the subtle *you* in essence, yet not *you*—\nhence these two are the profound *‘same origin, same return’* (同出而同归).\n\nZhuangzi said: *‘Establish it with constant wu-you,\nspeak of it with the Great Oneness (Tai Yi 太一).’*\nFor indeed, *‘constant wu-you’* (周读) is read as *‘constant wu, constant you.’*\nConstant *wu* is to observe its subtlety,\nconstant *you* is to observe its coarseness.\nBecause one observes its subtlety, it is established with constant *wu*,\nbecause one observes its coarseness, it is established with constant *you*.\nIf one speaks of the coarse and subtle as *‘forgetting and without desire to observe,’*\nthen what is called *‘establish it with constant wu-you’* is simply *‘obscured in mystery’* (冥之).\n\nThis is called *‘yet more profound’* (又玄),\nnot merely the same as called *‘profound’* (玄),\nbut *‘profound yet again profound’* (玄之又玄),\nthe gateway to all subtleties.\n\nThe profound is the essence of subtlety,\nthe subtle is the manifestation of the profound.\nThe subtle is the same origin as that which is not profound.\nLiu Ji (刘骥) humbly believes that Laozi’s discourse on *virtue/power* and *Dao/Way* (道德),\narising from Guan Yin’s (关尹) request,\nwas spoken extemporaneously and written in haste,\nnever divided into ninety chapters.\n\nLater scholars split it into two volumes,\nsymbolizing the subtle and manifest uses of the Two Principles (两仪),\nand eighty-one chapters (九九八十一),\ncorresponding to the ultimate number of the Great One (太阳).\nNow let it be restored as one.\n\nThe two teachings are named *‘Comprehensive Doctrine’* (通论),\nyet the mind is perplexed and cannot comprehend,\nthe mouth is baffled and cannot discuss.\nVast and boundless, it cannot be described or contained.\nIts first chapter begins with *‘The Dao/Way that can be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way,’*\nto show that the Dao/Way cannot be sought with reasoning.\nIts final chapter ends with *‘What cannot be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way,’*\nto show that the Dao/Way cannot be transmitted through words.\n\nDifficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom,\ndifficult to measure, difficult to recognize,\nlooking up, it grows ever higher,\npursuing it, it grows ever more distant.\nOne might think it like ascending to Heaven—\nseemingly unattainable.\n\nYet its essential meaning is no more than\nattaining *extreme emptiness* (虚极),\nand steadfastly preserving *profound stillness* (守静笃).\nIt is very easy to know, very easy to practice.\nYet none in the world can know it,\nnone can practice it,\nto open its *yue* (兑) and aid its affairs.\n\nThe ancient masters who excelled in the Dao/Way\nsealed their *yue* (兑),\nclosed their gates,\nshattered their theories,\ndissolved their confusion,\ntheir minds undisturbed,\nthey dwelled in the Dao,\nreturning to the root of *emptiness and stillness*,\nrecovering the origin of *nature and life* (性命).\nJust as all things arise from the root and return to the root,\nreturning to the root and recovering life,\nnurturing *nature* (性) and reflecting *virtue/power* (德),\nwhen *virtue/power* is attained, it aligns with the beginning,\nreturning to the *pu* (朴),\nin harmony with the Dao’s essence,\n*‘boundless yet without form’* (绳绳兮不可名),\nreturning to *wu-wu* (无物),\nneither born nor extinguished,\nneither self nor name,\nlife and death within oneself,\nentering and exiting without obstruction.\nThus, it is neither seen nor unseen,\nneither revealed nor concealed,\nneither close nor distant,\nneither beneficial nor harmful,\nneither honored nor humiliated—\nand so it can abandon things and transcend people,\nrising beyond Heaven and Earth’s\nyin-yang cycles and cosmic measures.\n\nGreat indeed are the most virtuous sages and divine persons—\nnone can reach them without this gate.\nWhat is known is difficult to speak,\nwhat is practiced is seen with the eyes,\nyet its power is vast while its function is profound.\nThe students must silently recognize and deeply cultivate it.\n\nIf one does not deeply cultivate and attain it oneself,\nbut seeks it through scrutiny,\nor investigates it through debate,\nit is like sitting in a well to observe the sky—\nhow could one hope to glimpse the Dao/Way’s *‘approximate likeness’* (仿髴)?\n\nZhao Shi’an (赵实庵) said:\nThe subtle Dao/Way is boundless and empty,\nestablishing teaching before Heaven’s manifestation,\nthe most true symbolizing the ultimate,\nthe Dragon Han (龙汉) opening the diagram,\nthe lineage of teachers transmitting the transformation—\nto the Three (三).\nThe cycles of *kalpa* (劫) intertwined—\nto the Nine (九).\n\nAt the *Tai Ji* (太极),\nthe primordial unity was first analyzed,\nHeaven and Earth opened, affairs simplified, people pure—\nthe Three Sovereigns (三皇) acted,\ninstituting tools and symbols,\nwithout contrivance or artifice—\nwhat was there of ritual and etiquette?\n\nAs the *kalpa* declined,\npurity was scattered,\nthough scriptures were not yet composed,\nand the profound teachings had not yet shone forth.\nThe initial profound words were first bestowed upon *You Yu* (有虞),\nand completed in the age of governance.\nThe Golden Mouth (金口) transmitted them to the *Ji* (姬) lineage,\nmaking the profound chapters widely manifest.\nThough passed down through a hundred kings,\nthey were also personally transmitted to *Guan Ling* (关令).\n\nIn the time of Emperor Ming (明皇),\nhis imperial commentary was issued by decree,\npreserved in the *Wei Temple* (徽庙),\na grand tradition of the sage’s words illuminating our lineage.\nAt the time, all revered it,\nas if in the *Qi* (始青) era,\nwith blessings extending through generations,\npermanently bright and unbroken.\n\nAs for the annotations and commentaries of a hundred schools,\npiled high like mountains and filling carriages,\neach exhausting their own minds,\nto expound the profound intent—\nnone could follow them so thoroughly as in the Ming era.\nThe Heavenly Mandate not having yet abandoned this learning,\nit is fitting that the world should again flourish in the Dao/Way,\nstill lamenting the neglect of *original learning* (元学) for long ages,\nthus dividing it into three for systematic study,\nso that listeners and observers may have a summary.\n\nDaring to hope that the subtle Dao/Way\nwill be revealed and illuminated,\nI shall now expound this scripture,\nbriefly categorizing it into ten gates (十门) for examination:\n1. The origin and cause of the initial teaching,\n2. The sequence of teaching separation and unity,\n3. The revelation of the doctrine’s essence and its trends,\n4. The Heavenly and human transmission of the lineage,\n5. The Three Realms (三洞) it encompasses,\n6. The scripture’s unique excellences,\n7. The initiation of Dao/Way’s cycles and their periods,\n8. The distinction between comprehensive and particular teachings,\n9. The fulfillment of causes and requests,\n10. The division of chapters based on textual analysis.»\n\n**1. The Origin and Cause of the Initial Teaching**\nThe Classics say: *\"The Dao/Way was established by Fu Xi and perfected by Yao, passed through Shun, Yu, Tang, and reached its fullness in the Zhou. After the reigns of King You and King Li, the Zhou dynasty declined, and by the time of Laozi, the world was chaotic without principles or culture. Sagehood did not arise, recluses spoke recklessly, and the people suffered from violence and poison. Laozi lamented the Zhou’s decline, seeing humanity lose its nature and emotions. He sought to restore them to purity and simplicity, returning to the ancient ways. Thus, he composed the *Classic*, emphasizing sincerity and loyalty, valuing simplicity, diminishing ritual propriety, and rejecting wisdom and sageliness, so that later generations might once again see the purity of Heaven and Earth and preserve the essence of antiquity.*\n\n*Laozi was contemporary with Confucius. When Confucius visited the Zhou to inquire about rites, Laozi spoke earnestly, advocating trust and humility. Confucius, however, focused on ren and yi, traveling tirelessly across the world, yet no ruler of his time could employ him. He sighed, ‘The phoenix does not come, the Yellow River does not reveal its map—I am finished.’ The world assumes that since Laozi lived in the declining Zhou, he did not uphold lofty virtue and the Dao/Way, unaware that Confucius, who openly spoke of ren and yi, also failed to transform his age. Indeed, the Dao/Way is the overarching name for ren and yi. If ren and yi cannot prevail, how can the Dao/Way be attained? Thus lies the origin of this teaching.*\n\n**2. The Sequence of Teaching: Separation and Unity**\nMany speak of the Dao/Way, yet their views reduce to two main schools. One holds that the Dao/Way is *emptiness, tranquility, stillness, and solitude*; the other, that it is *rites, propriety, laws, and governance*. Those who uphold emptiness and tranquility are deemed lofty and refined, while those who follow rites and laws are seen as moderate.\n\nThe lofty and refined withdraw into secluded cliffs, dwelling in desolation, offering no benefit to the world—abandoning themselves to uselessness. Though the world is vast, they discard it like worn-out shoes, refusing even a speck of worldly concern, standing aloof as *perfected beings*.\n\nThe moderate, however, are scholars of governance: they refine rites and music, rectify human relationships, standardize measures and weights, and establish laws. The world relies on them for order—they are those who *practice the Dao/Way to benefit the age*. Though they dwell within the realm of civilization, they are called *virtuous persons*.\n\nOnce these two paths are fixed, they seem as irreconcilable as ice and fire. Alas, can this truly be the understanding of the Great Dao/Way? It is the fault of unreflective minds.\n\nIn truth, the lofty and the moderate both stem from the same Sage’s Dao/Way and heart. The Sage embodies complete virtue, and from this unity arise both inner sageliness and outer kingship—never two separate paths. What was called *emptiness, tranquility, and solitude* is not merely a means of detachment but a cultivation of the three virtues.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says: *\"Meng nourishes the upright—this is the Sage’s achievement.\"* Hidden yet not revealed, it is called *inner sageliness*; manifest in action, it is called *outer kingship*. Emptiness is the source of all utility; tranquility, the essence of harmony for the world; stillness, the mechanism of motion. When virtue is complete here, one may govern the world.\n\nThus, when things accumulate, there arise rites; when carved, there arises propriety; when emotions are regulated, there arise laws; when observed, there arise measures. Only then does the path of governance become fully illuminated.\n\nInitially, it does not depart from nature. To exhaust nature is to know Heaven; to clarify nature is to grasp the Dao/Way. The *Book of Yao* calls Yao *\"reverent, enlightened, and thoughtful\"*—his governance was called *wuwei*. The achievements of *wuwei* all originate from the Dao/Way. How could the Dao/Way and the world be fundamentally divided?\n\nEmotions arise from nature; nature, when fractured, becomes emotion—like water disturbed into waves, which, when still, returns to water. Their essence is one.\n\nIf one claims the lofty Dao/Way and the moderate path are utterly opposed, this was not the intent of the Sage in composing the *Classic*. It is the fault of unreflective minds.\n\nLaozi, seeing the Dao/Way decline in the Zhou and humanity lose its nature, expounded the *upper* and *lower* teachings, speaking of the *Great Whole* to rescue the world’s later errors. Later scholars, failing to grasp his intent, divided them into *inner* and *outer* doctrines. The distinction between the moderate and the lofty led some to reject one for the other, or to cling to a single perspective. Since the Three Dynasties, scholars have taken many paths, some favoring one extreme, others a single angle. Without comprehensiveness or balance, how can one deeply understand the Dao/Way?\n\nOnly a Sage of perfect wisdom could clarify this.\n\nThe Han dynasty prioritized simplicity, yet its governance was limited; the Jin dynasty indulged in empty discourse, corrupting morals until it collapsed. I say that virtue and the Dao/Way are difficult to know and difficult to practice—for this reason.\n\nSome read Laozi’s words and are bewildered, deeming them not the Sage’s teachings. How could they truly know virtue and the Dao/Way?\n\nYet the *Five Thousand Words* divides its applications into three:\n1. The Dao/Way of *wuwei*,\n2. The Dao/Way of *long life*,\n3. The Dao/Way of *governance*.\n\nSome say the Great Dao/Way is emptiness, yet within emptiness lies the law of governance. Some say governance is the Great Dao/Way, yet governance is merely the residual function of the Dao/Way. As for cultivating the heart and nature, or the methods of *golden elixir* and *returning the elixir*, they cannot be reduced to a single principle.\n\nTo forget speech is to exhaust thought—thus one knows the upper and lower teachings harmonize with all methods. Their flexibility is boundless.\n\n**3. The Revelation of the Doctrine’s Essence and Its Trends**\nThe *Classic* says: *\"Speech has its root.\"* *Zhuangzi* says: *\"It does not depart from its root.\"* This is the *root of Heaven and humanity*.\n\nSequence exists to follow its principle, hence: *\"To speak of the Dao/Way, there must be sequence; to speak of the Dao/Way without its sequence, where then is the Dao/Way?\"*\n\nThe **Way’s** essence must first be illuminated, then its origins and culmination explored.\n\nLaozi’s *Classic* begins with the **Dao/Way**, then virtue/power.\n*Zhuangzi*’s Nine Transformations first clarifies Heaven, then virtue/power follows.\n*Zhuangzi*’s words follow the sequence of affairs—thus Heaven comes first.\nLaozi’s words follow the sequence of the **Dao/Way**—thus the **Dao/Way** is spoken first.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** takes \"no-root\" as its root, \"no-ancestor\" as its ancestor.\nThe Sage’s *Classic* takes *that which is* as its master, for *that which is* is the **Dao/Way**, and the **Dao/Way**’s nature is most mysterious.\nWith constancy reaching the utmost subtlety, subtlety returning to non-being—\nconstancy and the **Dao/Way** are nameless,\nconstancy and name are formless.\nBeing returns to non-being, being and non-being merge as one.\nHaving ascended to the Mysterious,\naffairs and principles are both forgotten;\nhaving entered this forgetting,\nthe Triple Mystery begins to manifest.\n\nGood and evil first divide at the Six Pairs,\nthe wondrous observation swiftly turns toward non-action.\nEmerging, it moves freely; retreating, it becomes vast and empty.\nThe **Dao/Way**’s great foundation is truly non-action.\n\nColor and emptiness preserve the adept’s wondrous observation,\nnon-action awakens the Sage’s spontaneous stillness.\nWords do not destroy illusion—\nthe **Dao/Way** must have its residue.\nWhat remains unremoved\nleads to neither emptiness nor emptiness of emptiness—\nyet one must guard against dullness,\ncalling it purity and clarity.\nThe mind’s moon must shine brightly—\nthis is called non-action.\nPreserving the nature of Heaven,\nit radiates thus, its master being emptiness and nothingness.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"To take frailty and humility as outward form,\nand emptiness without harming all things as substance.\"*\nIf the **Dao/Way** is divided into its branches,\nand nature and life become distinct—\nthe branch of nature breaks through conventions to return to truth,\nthe root of life is deeply rooted and firmly established.\n\nFrom non-being to being, the Immortal cultivates the alchemical arts;\nfrom being to non-being, nature and principle align with the void.\nAt its utmost, the **Dao/Way** is non-action.\nTo clarify its essence and trends,\nthe **Dao/Way** is taken as the root,\nemptiness and nothingness as its fulfillment.\n\nNow its branches and trends are divided into five pairs:\n1. Doctrine and teaching—doctrine as root, meaning as fulfillment.\n2. Dual illumination and being/non-being—dual illumination as root, the Mysterious as fulfillment.\n3. Self-restraint and gentleness—self-restraint as root, self-overcoming as fulfillment.\n4. Rectifying causes and cultivating truth—cultivating truth as root, longevity as fulfillment.\n5. Divine transformation and sincerity—sincerity as root, returning to antiquity as fulfillment.\n\n**IV. Heaven and Humanity’s Inherited Doctrine**\nThe **Dao/Way** and virtue/power are one,\nHeaven and humanity are unified.\nKnowing their unity and acting accordingly—\nthis is the Great Unity.\nKnowing their oneness and acting accordingly—\nthis is the Great Oneness.\nIf virtue/power knows the **Dao/Way**,\nit ascends to virtue/power and converges.\nIf the **Dao/Way** knows humanity,\nit cultivates through humanity.\n\nHeaven’s **Dao/Way** is remote and difficult to know,\nhumanity and Heaven are separated.\nTo bridge them, one must rely on the Sage.\nThe Sage having passed,\none relies on the *Classic* and diagrams.\nExamining the *Classic* to know the **Dao/Way**,\none proceeds from humanity to Heaven.\nObtaining the intent and forgetting the form,\none enters the **Dao/Way** through virtue/power.\n\nThe Most High Lord Laozi, the Sage of ultimate **Dao/Way**,\nresponded to the ages through transformation.\nWhen the Zhou declined,\nhe illuminated virtue/power to instruct the world.\nThe *Classic*’s intent—\nif one era’s ruler is taken as its master,\nthen in the Warring States there were sayings like\n*\"Small states submit to large states,\nlarge states submit to small states.\"*\nWhen repeatedly speaking of arms as an inauspicious tool,\nit was to admonish the rulers of their time with contemporary affairs.\nWhen speaking of the constant **Dao/Way**,\nit was to leave behind eternal brilliance,\nresonating with all spirits,\nenduring without end.\n\nIf the **Dao/Way** is restored to its ancient glory,\nthen purity returns and simplicity is recovered;\ncultivating the heart and nature,\nthen aging is reversed and youth restored;\ncleansing all actions,\nthen subtlety and mystery are perfected.\n\nThe Son of Heaven practices it and enjoys Great Peace,\nthe feudal lords uphold it and stabilize their states,\nministers and great officials uphold it and fulfill loyalty and filial piety,\ncommoners and scholars uphold it and achieve harmony,\nalchemists practice it and ascend to transcendence,\nmilitary strategists uphold it and achieve victory.\nThis is the flow of humanity’s inherited **Dao/Way**.\n\n**V. The Three Caverns’ Scope**\nIf one adheres to the constant **Dao/Way** and constant name,\nto non-action and tranquility,\nto non-duality without separation—\ninvisible to sight, inaudible to hearing,\nused without exhaustion—\nit precedes the Emperor,\nall being the supreme **Dao/Way**,\nnot to be grasped by form or appearance.\n\nAgain, the Six Pairs are unbalanced,\nhonor and disgrace are like sudden shocks,\nthe later body and the outer body—\nnot contending, gentle and frail—\nthis is the division between great and small.\n\nAgain, governing humanity and serving Heaven\nis nothing like frugality;\ngoverning a great state is like poaching a small fish—\nthe Most High knows what exists,\nyet acts through non-action, and the people transform themselves.\nThis is near the division of the common **Dao/Way**.\n\nFor cultivating oneself, one’s family, the state, and the world—\n\"small to great,\" \"compassion,\" \"frugality\"—\none does not dare to lead the world,\nfrom love extending to reverence,\nusing arms with funeral rites,\nwith subtle clarity in hidden mechanisms—\nall these are teachings for self-cultivation.\n\nAgain, the spirit of the Valley does not die,\nfor the belly is full yet the heart is empty.\nNurturing the *po* and embracing Oneness,\nthe *jing* and *qi* gather while the spirit converges,\nvague and distant yet trustworthy—\nand that which is easy to know and easy to practice,\nyet which no one can know or practice—\nthis is further than the Nine Elixirs of longevity,\nthe highest rank in the alchemical school,\nyet who can definitively point to its lineage?\n\nExamining this *Classic* deeply,\nit speaks of life having both affairs and principles,\nencompassing and summarizing all,\nmutually containing—\nit is called sudden, yet not without gradualness;\nit is called gradual, yet gradualness is also spoken of.\nThis *Classic* blends nature and life,\nforming a perfect teaching.\nResponding to causes and requests,\nYin Xi becomes its master.\nWithout recitation, it contracts all divisions of the *Classic*.\nGenerally, the character *dao* already reaches the utmost subtlety.\n\nAs for cultivating truth and nurturing life,\nrefining *qi* and nurturing spirit—\nthough they share the gate of transcendence,\nthey fundamentally differ in the art of halting death.\nThey constantly merge life’s principles with the **Dao/Way**.\nRealizing the utmost **Dao/Way** is non-action,\nthus the *Classics* prioritize governing life,\nexhausting the transformations of the Five Phases.\n\n**VI. Illuminating the *Classic*’s Superiority**\nSpeaking of the **Dao/Way**’s greatness,\none must follow its entirety.\nSpeaking of the spirit’s function,\none must focus on its transformations.\n\nIf one regards the **Dao/Way** as mere emptiness and stillness,\nthe soul perishes into annihilation,\nand the body becomes like wood and stone,\nwhile beasts and insects share its nature—\nhow could such a one grasp its transformations?\n\nAll the *Classics* arise from the **Dao/Way**, yet the Three Vehicles diverge in their teachings,\nand those who fail to comprehend their essence multiply into conflicting sects.\n\nThus, it demonstrates non-action through silence,\nunfolds immortality through its essential keys,\nexpounds the Five Phases in their hidden workings,\ndiscriminates medicines and minerals by cold and warmth,\nilluminates the cycles of rise and decline,\nand prohibits heterodox practices through talismans and spells.\n\nThe *Classics*, diagrams, edicts, and precepts\neach follow distinct paths and doctrines,\nthough they share the gate of **True Unity**,\nthey do not yet tread the path of perfect integration.\n\nComparing their superior qualities,\nnone rival this *Classic*.\nBriefly enumerating its tenfold excellence:\n1. It exhausts all laws through constancy;\n2. It unifies existence and non-existence through profundity;\n3. It demonstrates the most profound as the gate to all marvels;\n4. It establishes non-action as the substance of action;\n5. It declares the unconquerable as the greatest victory;\n6. It speaks of joy while transcending all joy;\n7. It conceals numbers within manifest numbers;\n8. It regards the Great Treasure as the divine instrument;\n9. It advances by retreat in the art of war;\n10. It establishes the world through speaking of non-affairs;\n11. It restores the age of decline to ancient splendor;\n12. It does not liken the great to the unworthy, thus all return to it;\n13. It embraces **Oneness** as the **Dao/Way** for governing self and state;\n14. It encompasses all *Classics* through brevity;\n15. It does not speak of nature, yet all principles of nature are revealed;\n16. It encompasses **Dao/Way**, virtue, nature, and life, verifying each in turn.\n\nWith this, one may study the principles and tendencies of all *Classics*—\nhow could they compare to this grand and wondrous application?\nThe divine craft cannot exhaust its wonders.\n\n**VII. Illuminating the **Dao/Way**’s Manifestation and Its Auspicious Periods**\nHeaven’s movements are never constant;\nwhen the time is right, the **Dao/Way** flourishes.\n\nThe Great **Dao/Way** is boundless,\nyet its manifestation among humanity depends on the times.\nFrom the five *kalpas* of obscurity and clarity,\nthe Primordial Sovereign guided the transformations,\nand since the Three Sovereigns descended,\neach dynasty inherited its succession—\nsometimes adopting or discarding teachings according to the age,\nsometimes rising or declining through events.\n\nConsider:\nThe Yellow Emperor received the talismans,\nYu of Xia transmitted the symbols,\nEmperors Yao and Shun bestowed the *Classics*,\nand the Zhou Dynasty displayed its traces.\n\nThe Qin King and Emperor Wu of Han sought the elixir of immortality,\nEmpress Dowager Dou and Emperor Xuan of Han devotedly upheld the teachings of the True Primordial.\nThe Tang honored the Sacred Ancestor,\nand established the principles of the Mysterious Thread.\n\nWhen the Song Emperor Huizong’s profound wisdom shone,\nhis enlightened intelligence radiated,\nand he received the Emperor’s secret words,\ncontinuing the **Dao/Way**’s lineage left unfinished by the Patriarchs.\nHe transmitted the Golden Talismans,\nopened the Celestial Palace,\ncomposed the *Flying Heaven Law Wheel Dao* Canon,\nexpounded the edicts of the **Mixed Primordial Emperor**,\nbroadened the study of the Original Learning,\nand established the Three-Shelter system for scholars and commoners.\nHe honored the Dao Palaces,\ngranted the Master of Teachings the rank of a high official,\nand decreed that celestial talismans, poems, hymns, and diagrams\nwere treasures unseen in ten thousand ages.\n\nAt that time, its grandeur unfolded suddenly,\nand none could fathom its origins.\nSuch extraordinary events\nwere due to the confluence of declining ages,\nthough some may have erred in idle discourse,\nunaware that the *kalpa*’s transmission had its day,\nand the teachings awaited their time.\n\nWhen the Han Dynasty flourished, the Yellow River School expounded the Mysterious,\nand when the Tang Dynasty rose, the Venerable Laozi manifested himself.\nWhen the world nears order, the **Dao/Way** does not act in vain,\nbut rather enhances the brilliance of the scriptures,\nrestoring the sequence of Great Peace.\n\nThe *Sutra on Guiding Beings* states: *\"Four ten-thousand *kalpas* for transmission.\"*\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"A sage appears once in ten thousand ages—\nif one seeks profound understanding,\none must first use the fishing basket and the oxcart.\"*\n\nThose who ride the **Dao/Way** must not forget the Great Teaching.\n\n**VIII. Distinguishing the Universal and the Particular**\nAll *Classics* have universal and particular aspects:\nthe universal refers to the general sequence,\nthe particular to the chapter-by-chapter exposition.\n\nThe universal sequence expounds the grand essence of a *Classic*;\nthe particular sequence unfolds its doctrines chapter by chapter.\nFor instance, the *Sutra on Guiding Beings* has a preface, middle, and postface,\nwith hidden meanings not confined to these three chapters.\n\nNow, when categorizing this *Classic* into universal and particular,\nthe **Dao/Way** and virtue constitute the universal,\nwhile the eighty-one chapters form the particular.\n\n**IX. Responding to Causes and Requests**\nWhen a *Classic* begins without \"You asked, and the Venerable Laozi responded, ‘Where are you?’\"\nit lacks a cause or request.\nExamining the *Classics* and transmissions,\nthe Venerable Laozi taught Yin Xi at the Pass.\nIt is also said that he first taught Emperor Shun.\n\nNow, in *Direct Pointing*, the Venerable Laozi of the Zhou Dynasty taught Yin Xi,\nfor the sake of the fundamental principles of nature and life—\na great and profound matter.\nResponding to Yin Xi,\nwho blocked the Pass and invited the Venerable Laozi to impart profound teachings,\nthis too is a case of responding to a request made clear.\n\nAccording to the *Sutra of Ascending West*,\nYin Xi, as the Pass Keeper, received the Venerable Laozi as a guest,\nand expounded on **Dao/Way** and virtue in two chapters—\nthe details are well-recorded.\n\n**X. Categorizing by Textual Structure**\nA *Classic* is divided into three parts:\nthe preface, the core doctrine, and the concluding transmission.\n\nThis *Classic* lacks opening questions,\nso it is deficient in the preface section;\nit also lacks concluding words of faith, reception, and practice,\nso it is deficient in the concluding transmission section.\n\nNow, we take Ge Xian Gong’s preface as the preface section,\nthe eighty-one chapters as the core doctrine,\nand the propagation of **Dao/Way** and virtue in the world as the concluding transmission.\n\nFurthermore, according to the *Lingbao Scripture*,\nthe introduction states:\n*\"All *Classics* take the ultimate fruit as the preface,\nthe cause as the core,\nand enlightenment as the concluding transmission.\"*\n\nShao Ruoyu said:\nThe **Dao/Way** reveals the real through non-action,\ngranting it special privilege—\nthis is the clarity of non-being.\nVirtue embodies the **Dao/Way** as law and applies it to affairs—\nthis is the realm of action.\nThe two characters, **Dao/Way** and virtue,\nencompass all things without omission.\nThe stages and orders they present\ndepend on the depths of the **Dao/Way** and the divisions of virtue—\nif one does not clarify these stages,\nthere will be mutual confusion and slander.\n\nThe Great **Dao/Way** is tranquil and utterly empty,\nformless and nameless, beyond speech.\nIts scriptures cannot be recorded,\nhence it is called the *Great Ease*.\nThe *Great Ease* refers to the state before *qi* manifests.\nWhen the *Great Ease* moves, the initial *qi* appears,\nhence it is called *Taiqi*.\nThe Venerable Laozi named this strong *qi* as the **Dao/Way**.\n\n「Confucius said: That which is beyond form is called **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe Venerable Śākyamuni expounded the Four Noble Truths (*catvāri-āryasatyāni*), also calling it **Dao/Way**.\n\nThus, it is known that the teachings of these three—\nall are fully contained within *being* (*you*).\n\nIf one does not proceed from *being*,\nhow could one attain clarity of non-being?\nTo clarify non-being through *being*—\nthis is why the **Dao/Way** has depths and shallows.\n\nThe *Great Ease* is the state of utter emptiness (*xūwú*).\nWhen it moves, it becomes the initial stage of *being*,\nhence it is called *Taiqi* (*Great Primordial*).\nWhen *qi* manifests, it marks the beginning of form,\nhence it is called *Taishǐ* (*Great Commencement*).\nWhen *qi* and form unite,\nthey produce the essence of firmness and softness,\nhence it is called *Taísù* (*Great Substance*).\nWhen *qi*, form, and essence are complete,\nyet they have not yet separated—\nthis is called *Húndùn* (*Chaos*).\n\nOnce *Húndùn* divides,\nthe forces of *yin* and *yang* oscillate,\nwith *one qi* (*yīqì*) dwelling at the center,\nand all things arise from it.\nThus the Venerable Laozi said:\nThe **Dao/Way** gives birth to *One*,\n*One* gives birth to *Two*,\n*Two* gives birth to *Three*,\nand *Three* gives birth to all things.\n\nTherefore, the Sage observes above and below,\nembodies the reverence of Heaven and the humility of Earth,\nand applies the **Dao/Way** to govern,\nthus manifesting the **Dao/Way** of the enlightened ruler (*míngwángdào*).\n\nEstablishing the Five Constants (*wǔcháng*) and the Hundred Virtues (*bǎixíng*),\nto rectify the institutions of sovereign and minister,\nfather and son,\nhusband and wife,\nand to govern and regulate the people.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is without name or trace,\nwithout death or birth,\neternally enduring through countless *kalpas* (*wànjié*) yet unchanging,\nsupreme and exalted beyond compare,\nwondrous and beyond speech.\n\nThe **Virtue/Power** of the highest order (*shàngdé*)\nembodies *non-action* (*wúwéi*) as its function,\ntreats *One* as the law to govern the world,\nso all things act yet without blame,\ngive birth yet without possession,\ndo yet without reliance,\nand complete deeds without taking credit.\n\nThe lower understanding grasps *being* yet fails to see its treasure—\nall things will naturally transform.\nThus, there is no failure or loss,\nbecause *non-action* (*wúwéi*) governs all things.\n\nIf one loses this,\nthen clinging to *One* while indulging in *action*,\nit becomes the **Virtue/Power** of the inner self (*nèidé*).\n\nThe **Virtue/Power** of the lowest order (*xiàdé*)\nembodies *One* as its function,\ntreats *yin* and *yang* as the law to govern the world—\nthus Confucius said, *One* threads through all things (*yīyǐguànzhī*).\nThe adept in establishing *One* as the norm (*déyīwéizhèng*)\nwill see all things naturally conform to order (*wànwùjiāngzìbīn*).\n\nIf one loses *One* and follows the Five Constants and the Hundred Virtues,\nthen in affairs, it becomes the **Virtue/Power** of the outer self (*wàidé*).\n\nThe **Virtue/Power** of the inner self (*nèidé*)\nis to hold fast to *One*.\nFor *One* is the mother of the realm (*guó*),\nthe root of life (*shēng*).\nTo hold fast to *One* without separation\nis to have roots deep and foundations firm—\nthe **Dao/Way** of enduring life and prolonged vision (*jiǔshì*).\n\nConfucius called this **Virtue/Power** supreme (*zhìdé*),\nand grounded it in the **Dao/Way**.\n\nAgain, the *Middle Way* (*Zhōngyōng*)\nis named when *joy, anger, sorrow, and delight* (*xǐnùāilè*) have not yet arisen,\nthe heart dwelling in the balance of *yin* and *yang*.\nThe Venerable Śākyamuni called this the *Middle **Dao/Way*** (*zhōngdào*).\n\nThe *Mysterious Gate* (*Xuánmén*) loses this and becomes *chatter* (*láo*).\nWhen *yin* and *yang* operate in secret,\nthey become the basis of *law and technique* (*fǎshù*).\n\nThe **Virtue/Power** of the outer self (*wàidé*)\nis cultivated through the Five Constants and the Hundred Virtues in one’s person.\nConfucius called this **Virtue/Power** responsive (*mǐndé*),\nand grounded it in *action* (*xíng*).\n\nTo dwell in softness and weakness, uncontentious as water,\nyet to overcome hardness and strength through kindness and frugality—\nor to appear clumsy and dull-witted—\nall these are examples of it.\n\nIf one loses this,\nthen one indulges in cleverness and superficiality,\nboasts of strength and prowess,\nhunts and revels in fields,\nand values wealth while seeking honor and avoiding disgrace.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice,\nyet people love shortcuts (*jìng*),\nso its path grows ever more distant,\nand its understanding ever more scarce.\n\nThe **Great Dao/Way** is plain and simple (*píngyì*),\nyet its efficacy lies in *non-action* (*bùwéi*).\n\nIn brief, all return to *non-desire* (*wùyù*).\nWithout desire, one attains tranquility (*jìng*),\nand pure tranquility is the rectification for the world.\n\nThe Venerable Laozi did not speak of *medicine* (*yào*),\ndid not speak of *immortality* (*xiān*),\ndid not speak of ascending to Heaven in broad daylight (*báirìshēngtiān*)—\nhe only spoke of **Dao/Way** and **Virtue/Power**,\nnot of *technique* (*shù*).\n\n**Dao/Way** and **Virtue/Power**—\nthe *True Scripture of the Great Meaning* (*Zhēnjīng Jíyì Dàzì*)—\nhere concludes the middle scroll on the grand essence.\nHere begins the lower scroll on the grand essence.»\n\nThe Venerable Master Far-Dao often expounds upon the profound and mysterious principles of Dao and Virtue/Power.\n\nThose who revere the Old Master (Laozi) as **Saintly Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness** (*shèngzhì rényì*), or who claim his teachings are practical for governance, merely grasp his outward forms and tools—nothing more.\n\nBut the Old Master, indeed, traces **Dao/Way** to its origin while encompassing the roots of all tools. Thus, the *Five Classics*, the *Three History Texts*, and the *Six Scriptures* (*liùjīng*) all fall under his comprehensive influence.\n\nYet when doubts arise about the Old Master, opinions diverge.\n\nSome say that what the world relies upon for governance—**Benevolence, Righteousness, Ritual, Music, Penal Laws, and Political Order** (*rényì lǐyuè xíngzhèng*)—are like the farmer’s plow or the artisan’s tools: without these implements, there would be no such use. If **Saintly Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness** (*shèngzhì rényì*) could be discarded, then governance would be like hoping for order with bare hands—an impossibility in all ages.\n\nBoth these views are but self-centered perspectives, unable to grasp the fundamental distinction between **Dao/Way** and tools.\n\nIf **Dao/Way** does not depend on tools, then the Old Master’s teachings should be confined solely to **non-action** (*wú*). Yet war and punishment, taxes and wealth, vessels and implements—all these **Dao/Way’s categories and tools** (*dàodào zhī pǐnqì*)—are employed to aid governance. Thus, it is impossible to say that **Dao/Way** ever lacks any of them.\n\nIf it cannot lack them, then **Saintly Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness** (*shèngzhì rényì*) must still exist; how could one claim that **Dao/Way** is utterly impractical?\n\nIf **Dao/Way** transcends form and tools, then it must not await the Old Master’s words to be illuminated. For since the establishment of the **Great Ultimate** (*Tàijí*) and the division of Heaven and Earth, the creation of scriptures and rituals—ever since the opening of the world—none have spoken of **Dao/Way** before the *Book of Changes* (*Yì*). If **Dao/Way** and tools are both contained within the *Yì*, then why should it depend on the later emergence of the Old Master?\n\nThus, those who revere the Old Master while claiming he surpasses the *Five Classics*, the *Three History Texts*, and the *Six Scriptures*, or who doubt him while asserting his teachings are empty and useless, all fail to truly understand the Old Master.\n\nYet the Old Master’s lofty aspirations are indeed present. He delves into the mysteries of **Dao/Way** and speaks of **non-action** (*wú*), exhaustively revealing its subtleties. He employs tools in accordance with **Dao/Way**, yet does not confine himself to mere tools. All that the *Six Scriptures*, the *Analects* (*Lún*), and the *Mencius* (*Mèng*) emphasize—recording events without probing their deeper principles—this book fully elucidates.\n\nTherefore, his work may be placed alongside the *Six Scriptures* as equally authoritative.\n\nSome say that sages and worthies discuss **Dao/Way’s origin** to clarify the world. If so, then their words must still harbor unexpressed intentions.\n\nThere are two possible explanations. Either their hearers were unworthy of deeper discourse, and thus they spoke only superficially, or their own thoughts were incomplete, and they could only hint at the beginning.\n\nConsider the convergence of human mind and **Dao/Way’s mind** (*dàoxīn*). Though they share common ground, the principle of **single-minded focus** (*jīngyī*) could only be imparted by Yao and received by Shun. Who else could participate?\n\nThe **Dao/Way of unity** (*yīguàn*) was only fully expressed by Zengzi’s \"One Thread\" (*yīwéi*), yet not by Zigong. The **four seasons’ operations** and the **birth of myriad things**—though Zigong heard them, he could not replicate their fullness.\n\nAs for **human nature** and the **Dao/Way of Heaven** (*tiāndào*), they are concealed within the written texts. Even Zigong in his early years could not fully grasp them.\n\nAll such matters are unexplored depths in the *Six Scriptures*, the *Analects*, and the *Mencius*.\n\nBut the Old Master records his transcendent insights, hoping that in ten thousand generations, a **Great Sage** (*dàshèng*) will arise to encounter them. His expectations are distant, so he does not wait for one who can personally receive his words before imparting them.\n\nThus, the origins of Heaven and Earth, the beginnings of creation and transformation, the foundations of **Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**—all are exhaustively traced and fully expressed. He establishes categories and ranks, arranging them in order, so that the Confucian scholar who seeks profundity and detail has no closer source.\n\nExamining their practical applications, how could they possibly conflict with Confucian principles? They are, in truth, the **greatest aid to Confucian order** (*rúlùn*).\n\nIf one could calmly observe, discern his refinements, and grasp his core intent, then the three sages’ teachings would be easily comprehended. Their essence is already unfolded in plain speech, from the *Book of Poetry* (*Shī*) and the *Book of Documents* (*Shū*) onward. Their breadth and depth should only be further summarized here.\n\n**Being and Non-being** (*yǒuwú*)\n\nWhen speaking of **being and non-being** in terms of form, all that existed before Heaven and Earth could be named as **non-being** (*wú*). Once Heaven and Earth were formed, and without relying on **human beings, things, or affairs** as tools, then all that should be named as **being** (*yǒu*).\n\nThis is naming **being and non-being** according to their forms.\n\nCommon folk, hearing that the Old Master values **non-being**, doubt that he merely dismisses all forms and physical bodies as irrelevant—thus deeming his teachings impractical.\n\nYet how could they know that the Old Master’s **being and non-being** (*yǒuwú*) refers to the mutual interplay of **Dao/Way** and tools, which cannot be broadly sought through mere forms?\n\nMoreover, **the Undifferentiated** (*Hùnchéng*) is **the Mysterious** (*Xuán*), and **the Mysterious** is **the Mysterious again** (*yòu xuán*). His inquiry reaches the **invisible and inaudible** (*bùkějiànwén*), and if one seizes it, it is **non-being**—the ultimate.\n\nYet Heaven, though square and round, arises from this **non-being**—how could this singular **non-being** not encompass all **being**?\n\nWhen it manifests as **being**, the products of Heaven and Earth are **human beings and things**, and all **human beings and things** contain **original qi** (*yuángas*).\n\nThe **Dao/Way’s branches** are **Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, and Ritual** (*dé rényì lǐ*), and all **Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, and Ritual** encompass the **Great Dao/Way**.\n\nThus, all that is called **myriad beings** is but the divided manifestation of the **Undifferentiated**’s **non-being**.\n\nUpon careful reflection, one will then see the **beginning and end** of **being and non-being**.\n\nTherefore, when the *Book of Changes* first speaks of the **Great Dao/Way**, it also considers that the world’s people may not know how **Dao/Way** and tools mutually depend.\n\nThus, it unites **Dao/Way** and tools as a **single origin** (*yīchū*), and names their manifestations according to what is seen. Hence, what is seen above is called **Dao/Way**, and what is seen below is called **tools**.\n\nThe **upper and lower** spoken of here are like saying that within a single entity there exists that which ascends above and that which descends below—yet it cannot be divided into two distinct forms as **ascending** and **descending**.\n\nFire within the wood, when it ascends and becomes empty, is called **flame**; when it settles and becomes solid, it is called **charcoal**. **Flame** and **charcoal** arise solely from the division of ascending and descending within a single fire. If one claims that the ascending flame is fire, yet the settled charcoal is not fire, then all will recognize the error in this.\n\nThis analogy is the most immediate and evident illustration of **Dao/Way** and **tools**’s **upper and lower** distinction.\n\nLaozi, following the *Book of Changes* in speaking of **Dao/Way**, altered its terminology, thus transforming **Dao/Way** and **tools** into **being** and **non-being**, and **upper** and **lower** into **wondrous subtlety**. This was merely to establish his own authority and demonstrate that he had no master to follow.\n\nYet in essence, there is no difference between them.\n\nWhen he speaks of **wondrous subtlety**, he combines the notions of **upper** and **lower** and uses the exterior and interior of a single entity to elucidate the distinction between **tools** and **Dao/Way**.\n\nAll things that possess form and substance, and all matters that exhibit traces and characteristics—whether as vast as Mount Tai or as minute as an autumn hair, whether as expansive as the heavens or as confined as a broom’s sweep—must have their **upper** and **lower**, their **exterior** and **interior**. Thus, **Dao/Way** and **tools** are never truly separate.\n\nYet Laozi’s reverence for **non-being** lies in its being the **source** and all-encompassing, not in his delight for its emptiness. His contempt for **being**, too, stems from its **entangling presence** when confined in form.\n\nHe does not say that once **being** is engaged, it can no longer be **Dao/Way’s use**.\n\n**Non-being within being**—when form divides **being** and **non-being**, then all that belongs to **Dao/Way** is **non-being**, and all that belongs to **tools** is **being**. Their distinction is easily discerned.\n\nBut when **Dao/Way** becomes **tools**, then it has form and substance. With form and substance complete, **true non-being** can no longer be seen.\n\nNow, if we say that Laozi could **master non-being** while **employing being**, then where within its form does he take **non-being**? It is said that **non-being** is inherently carried within **being**. Yet this **non-being** is the most difficult to articulate.\n\nObserve that within all affairs and things, the **empty** and **real** are always in opposition. Thus, those who can comprehend this will understand:\n\nThe **real** is its form and substance; the **empty** is that which does not cling to form and substance yet governs the **real** within it.\n\nTherefore, the **emptiness** within the **real** is the **non-being** within **being**. Laozi indeed clarified this principle to teach others.\n\nHis key words state:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at one hub, yet it is the hub’s emptiness that makes the wheel’s use possible.\nThus, being is for advantage, non-being is for use.\"*\n\nThe reason the wheel can move is that its spokes and hub are complete—so the spokes and hub are the **real** and **being** within the wheel. But when it comes to **rolling over earth** and **moving forward**, this occurs beyond the wheel’s form and substance, where its function does not belong to **being** but instead to **non-being**.\n\nThis principle—**being** carrying **non-being**, and **non-being** enabling **use**—is the most verifiable of truths.\n\nThus, Laozi applied this principle to human affairs and used it to illuminate his teachings. When he says *\"being is for advantage\"*, he means **cultivating** and **fulfilling** it to ensure its completeness. When he says *\"non-being is for use\"*, he means **abating** and **reducing** it to achieve its function.\n\nIf its completeness is achieved yet there is nothing to **employ** it, then the wheel cannot move on its own. So the spokes and hub are what the wheel **possesses** as **being**, yet the wheel’s **movement** is not what it inherently contains.\n\nWhat it does not inherently contain should rightly be called **non-being**. This is Laozi’s principle of **transcending being** to **employ non-being**.\n\nHence, even when **Dao/Way** manifests in **tools**, such as **weapons** or **punishments**, which grow ever more **concrete** and **real**, he does not deem them worthy of explanation.\n\nTherefore, **tranquility and humility, compassion and simplicity** are the principles governing **weapons**; **relief and dependence on the people’s livelihood**, waiting for them to **value themselves** and **fear death**, then **punishing** the unworthy to serve as a warning, are the principles governing **punishments**.\n\n**Tranquility and humility, compassion and simplicity**—are these not the very opposites of **swords and axes, slaughter and butchery**? Yet those who **dwell without constraint** and **live without satisfaction** are not the instruments of **swords and axes** that ever sought them.\n\nLaozi takes these two meanings to **transcend** the realm of **weapons** and **punishments**, thereby making his principle of **mastering non-being** while **employing being** clearly evident.\n\nIn its ultimate refinement, this principle **goes beyond** speaking of **weapons** as **weapons** or **punishments** as **punishments**, causing **weapons** and **punishments** to **serve his purpose** while he remains **unbound** by them. Only then does he attain the **non-being** he holds in esteem—not the **non-being** that the world misinterprets as **uselessness**.\n\n**Non-being within being**—this principle is not unique to Laozi; Confucius and Mencius also spoke of it.\n\nThey said:\n*\"To hear a lawsuit and still render judgment—this is what I am. My ideal is to make lawsuits nonexistent.\"*\n*\"The virtuous have no enemies.\"*\n\nWhen two parties **contend in litigation**, only then does a **lawsuit** arise; when two armies **clash in battle**, only then does an **enemy** appear. **Lawsuits** and **enemies** give rise to **weapons** and **punishments**.\n\nYet if one seeks to **eliminate their source**, it must be through **emptiness** and **non-being**. Thus, the world’s praise—*\"a single word can settle a dispute\"*—and the **strategic maxims** of *\"ensure victory in battle\"* or *\"exhaust all possibilities\"*—these are not what adheres to **Dao/Way**.\n\nWhy? Because they **cannot transcend** the **exterior** and are **confined** within the **interior**.\n\nTo **roll a brick**, one’s body must be **outside the brick**; yet **pushing or pulling a boat**, the **operations** and **controls** applied are all **not within the boat’s bow or stern**. Thus, **effort is minimal** yet **results are maximal**.\n\nThis is also Laozi’s meaning of **leveraging being** in the **spokes and hub**, yet **abating and reducing** it to **non-being** for true **use**.\n\nAlthough this is merely Confucius and Laozi speaking of **military and penal law** while harmonizing their principles of **being** and **non-being**, their reasoning is already quite clear.\n\nWhen they speak of **artifacts and things**, they **leverage non-being within being**, and their logic is even more evident.\n\nConfucius spoke of **rites and music**, saying:\n*\"Rites, rites!\"—do they refer to jade and silk?*\n*\"Music, music!\"—do they refer to bells and drums?*\nHe emphatically declared that **artifacts alone cannot fully embody rites and music**.\n\nThe **reverence** inherent in rites is not jade or silk—yet without this reverence, jade and silk cannot fulfill their role as rites.\nThe **harmony** inherent in music is not bells or drums—yet without this harmony, bells and drums cannot fulfill their role as music.\n\nThus, both demonstrate the principle of **\"substantially relying on emptiness.\"**\n\nComparing this to Laozi’s words, bells and drums, jade and silk are like the **spokes and hub of a chariot**—rites and music **depend on artifacts to manifest**. Yet artifacts alone cannot fully constitute rites and music, just as **transcending the spokes and hub** is what enables the chariot’s function in **transportation**. Both follow the same principle.\n\nMoreover, when Laozi expounded the subtleties of **non-action**, applying them to governance, he even claimed that **primitive knotted cords** could suffice.\n\nThus, it was fitting that he inverted and transformed rites and laws, establishing an alternative approach.\n\nYet upon closer examination, all the **boats, chariots, weapons, and armor**—these are the very implements of the **Five Emperors and Three Kings**. Yet he dared to claim superiority over the **Six Classics**, saying:\n*\"My Dao transcends mere forms and artifacts. I will correct superficiality with simplicity, govern the world with non-interference, and await the people’s natural contentment—when they value life and do not flee far. Then, even these material tools, though useful, can be set aside.\"*\n\nWhen comparing the principle of **\"using non-being\"**, it aligns entirely with Confucian thought. It is only their methods of teaching that differ, leading to divergent phrasing.\n\nIf Laozi had initially followed the **original language of the *Great Dao/Way and Its Manifestations*** and retained its traditional terminology, simply stating:\n*\"I honor the Dao and humble artifacts. I wield the Dao to command things,\"*\nthen no one would have doubted him.\n\nBut because he transformed **Dao and artifacts into being and non-being**, people failed to recognize that **non-being inherently encompasses being**. Thus, his exaltation of **non-being** risked appearing as idle expectation, hoping for results without action—how could they not doubt?\n\n**Great Master Zhang** has already clarified this principle, yet some listeners still disagree. When reading Laozi, if one replaces **\"non-being\" with \"Dao\"** and **\"Dao\" with \"non-being\"**, the value of non-being becomes clear, and all doubts dissolve.\n\n**Laozi’s use of non-being in three distinct ways** all revolve around **\"gathering emptiness to transform reality.\"**\n\nTo **dull sharpness and resolve disputes**, to **harmonize brilliance with the mundane**, to **purify and perceive the profound**, and to **minimize private desires**—these seek to **remove what harms emptiness**.\n\nTo **drain excess without depletion**, to **conceal the numinous without revealing it**, to **abandon completion without claiming it**—these seek to **embody this emptiness**.\n\nWhen it comes to **grasping the reins of emptiness and reality** to regulate the principles of being and non-being, the application of **hardness and softness** is most comprehensive and clearly articulated.\n\nFor **hardness as Dao**, if one seeks to **achieve directly without detours**, its form becomes **solid and blocked**.\nFor **softness as Dao**, it **responds to prompts**, follows without contention—yet within, **real actions and decisions are made**, while **rigidity remains unseen**. Thus, its form is **open and fluid**.\n\nHence, the **open can govern the blocked**, and **softness often overcomes hardness**.\n\nIn all cases—whether **knowing when to be fierce yet yielding**, or **taking the lead by stepping back**—these are all **rejecting hardness’s blockage** and **embodying softness to act through emptiness**.\n\nThis is also how one **reverses things** to ultimately achieve **great harmony**.\n\nWhen the **open and empty** take action, they move **without trace**, accomplish **without effort**—such is their effect.\n\nWhen **wielding reality while mastering emptiness**, no one can perceive it.\nOnly when its effects manifest in emptiness do people **suddenly marvel at its mystery**—this is the *Great Dao/Way and Its Manifestations*’ principle of **\"not hastening yet arriving swiftly, not moving yet reaching far.\"**\n\nThus, he summarizes his overarching principle:\n*\"Softness is the Dao’s application.\"*\nThen, when explaining how softness is applied, he adds:\n*\"All things under heaven arise from being; being arises from non-being.\"*\n\n**Success and failure through non-being**\nThe principle of valuing non-being has long been a treasure used by ancients and moderns alike. Yet some succeed with it, while others fail.\n\n**King Wen of Zhou** abandoned **Fengxi**, and **Xu Youwang** refused to drive his people into war—these are of one kind.\n**Emperor Yuan of Han** was indecisive, and **Emperor Wen** was silent—also of one kind.\nYet their outcomes were vastly different, so later generations, judging by appearances, criticized their failures, saying:\n*\"Knots and cords could not save the chaos of Qin, nor could the *wu gan* dance resolve the crisis at Pingcheng.\"*\nThey thus dismissed Laozi’s words as useless, unaware that the fault lay in their **misapplication**, so how could they be said to understand?\n\n**Liezi** constructed the analogy of the **Xiang and Guo clans** to illustrate wealth, clarifying that **similar intentions led to opposite outcomes**—saying:\n*\"Xiang understood Guo’s words on wealth but not the Dao of wealth, thus it backfired upon himself.\"*\nHis intent was precisely to draw this parallel.\n\nThe **Eighty-first Chapter** indeed takes **softness as its foundation**, yet its methods of applying it—**restraining the lenient with strictness, tempering the lax with vigor, acting secretly**—are such that when **misguided people abandon the proper path for the strange**, it is because **rigid integrity and brilliance have already emerged to govern**.\n\nCould it be that there is **only softness and no hardness**?\n\nThe people all rely on life while fearing death, yet some still dare to act strangely—if they are seized and killed, then the authority’s power over love is utterly without flaw. Again, if one boasts of their tools’ sharpness and claims victory is certain, then one should merely suppress their strength, weaken their vigor, and cover it with softness. This is not an exclusive adherence to softness.\n\nThus, all who in this world admire emptiness and simplicity while neglecting practical affairs are those who cling to the receptive yet never grasp the creative. Those who lack the virtue of the ancient sages and seek to engage in mere ritualistic affairs will inevitably meet with ruin.\n\nWhen the *Dao* is compared to the *Yijing*’s division of existence and nonexistence, it is merely a distinction between *Dao* and its manifestations. Yet in *Laozi*, the gradations of existence and nonexistence are far more intricate. From nonexistence upward, there is the *Xuan* (玄) and then the *Youxuan* (又玄), which becomes the gateway to all marvels. The perpetually nonexistent is merely what one may follow to observe these marvels. But to encompass all marvels and manifest them, one must belong to the *Youxuan*.\n\nFrom *Xuan* to *Youxuan* is to ascend to the *Dao* as naturalness itself. Naturalness—what is done without doing, what in the world acts spontaneously, transforms itself, rectifies itself, and enriches itself without knowing the power of the Sovereign—this is its effect. Therefore, *Laozi* dares to belittle the wisdom of sages, for he grounds himself in this foundation to elevate his loftiness. Since the *Dao* becomes virtue, and virtue endures by not being possessed, the three names—*One* (一), *Symbol* (象), and *Uncarved Block* (朴)—are its summation.\n\nFrom this arises heaven and earth, and creation manifests as benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness—all are virtue. Yet within the Five Constants, each virtue further divides into higher and lower. When the highest virtue reaches its peak, there is still a deeper virtue beyond it, crowned with *Xuan* as *Xuan Virtue* (玄德). The *receptive female* (牝) and the *receptive unity* (同), the *receptive vision* (览)—these are of the same kind, though their names reside in virtue, their essence has already entered the *Dao*.\n\nSuch is the detail, hence those who speak of the Six Classics and *Lunyu-Mengzi* draw from it, truly not in vain. Let us take the discussion of *ren* (仁) between Confucius and Mencius as an example and compare it with *Laozi*’s words, then one will know that though Confucian speech has distinctions, its established gradations do not match the precision of *Laozi*’s insights.\n\nFor instance, a child’s love for their parents and rescuing a child from a well are both called *ren*. Yet the *Nine Alliances and One Rectification* is said to be the opposite of truly attaining the name of *ren*. This distinction, though acknowledged by Confucius and Mencius, was never fully elaborated in their gradations. As for broadly benefiting and aiding the people, extending it to the sage, even Zigong doubted whether it fully exhausted *ren*’s principles—because the gradations were insufficiently refined, and the standard could not be firmly established.\n\nThus, the Six Classics and Confucius-Mencius must rely on *Laozi*, for all such cases are of this nature. This is not to oppose *Laozi* while suppressing Confucianism; *Laozi*’s focus on nonexistence allows him to elaborate further on the *Dao*’s gradations. If one reverses the perspective, then Confucian speech, detailed in worldly affairs, appears overly sparse and vague in *Laozi*’s eyes. Since their fundamental orientations differ, their discussions naturally vary in depth—this is inevitable, not a matter of superiority or inferiority.\n\nAs for *Laozi*’s nonexistence, its need for the Six Classics’ existence is something everyone recognizes, requiring no further debate.\n\n**On the Sequence of the *Dao*:**\nTo ascend from learning to enlightenment, one must first follow the path and only then enter the chamber. There is a beginning and an end, firmly establishing its ordered sequence. The world holds *Laozi* in too high regard, saying that he does not discuss the *Dao*’s manifestations. Thus, whenever his teachings touch on practical cultivation, they always lead to self-reduction and nonexistence. Hence, his writings, though seemingly superficial, are in fact the outer and inner layers of nonexistence—yet they cannot encompass the nonexistence that contains existence.\n\nBoth Confucian and Daoist discussions of the *Dao* treat its manifestation as the key to sagehood. Yet when examining how transformation is achieved, they all rely on reducing existence to enable the transformation of existence into nonexistence. From this principle, one can discern the *Dao*.\n\nReduction begins with cultivation—like fermenting millet and adding mold to make wine. Once completed, the millet and mold transform into sweetness. This is indeed the symbol of transforming existence into nonexistence. Yet has there ever been, from ancient times to now, one who could alter water alone without millet and mold?\n\nIf one seeks refined wine from mere water without first fermenting millet and adding mold, it is like demanding the five flavors from an empty vessel—this is to leap from the stage of cultivation to the beginning of reduction, claiming to achieve transformation without the necessary preparation. If cultivation is not yet complete, what foundation will receive this reduction?\n\nSuch cases vary with depth and shallowness. The world will surely criticize them as superficial. Yet those who dare to trust themselves will harmonize the Six Classics with Confucius and *Laozi*, finding no discrepancy. Even if *Laozi* were to rise again, this statement would remain unchanged.\n\n**On Heaven and Humanity:**\nFrom ancient times...\n\n「Existence and nonexistence are but two brushstrokes. The Great Dao in which one abides is boundless and obscure, profound and silent—this is the state of nonexistence. From nonexistence to existence, from existence to transformation, returning again to nonexistence, then its existence and nonexistence are as one. The Dao of cultivation and reduction is likewise: beginning with existence and ending with nonexistence, then existence and nonexistence are again as one.\n\nThe earlier discourse on existence and nonexistence relies upon the interplay of yin and yang in life and death. Once things are formed, they revert to their root—this is the Dao of Heaven’s existence and nonexistence. When virtue is manifested through benevolence, righteousness, and propriety, and its deepest essence aligns with the Dao, then this is the Dao of Humanity’s existence and nonexistence. Though both arise from the same origin, their expressions differ vastly, so they cannot be conflated. Hence, *Laozi*’s words sometimes fail to distinguish between Heaven and Humanity, conflating their existence and nonexistence, for he knew their root was one and did not need to separate them as distinct.\n\n**On *Laozi*’s Rejection of Sage-Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness:**\nThose who deeply understand *Laozi*’s outright abandonment of sage-wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness say: This is but a rhetorical exaggeration, not his true intent. Yet the world, past and present, mostly blames him for his words clashing with the Classics. Yet if one listens to his teachings and examines his deeds, the true principles become evident, and he cannot be falsely accused.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s thirteen hexagrams that emphasize symbols and instruments—including the saying, *\"垂衣裳而天下治\"* (governing by hanging one’s robes and the world is in order)—draw upon the principles of *乾* (Heaven) and *坤* (Earth). This was the very method by which the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun successively innovated and upheld governance. Thus, sage-wisdom was indeed the domain of the Yellow Emperor as well.\n\n*Laozi* invoked the Yellow Emperor to found his teaching, yet condemned all ancient sage-wisdom as false, implying even the Yellow Emperor was among those rejected. How could one person, whose Way could be emulated yet whose methods were utterly discarded? Judging by *Laozi*’s own deeds, his words were but ornamentation, not substance—this is clear.\n\n**On Zhuangzi’s Expansion of *Laozi*’s Teachings:**\nZhuangzi further magnified and broadened his master’s doctrine, declaring that *\"剖斗折衡而民不争\"* (splitting the measuring cup and breaking the scales would make the people cease contention). This statement especially compounds the criticism leveled against *Laozi*’s teachings. Yet within it lies truth, and one can use his own words to illuminate their rhetorical nature.\n\nBoth *Laozi* and Zhuangzi championed the practice of knotting cords (*结绳*) as a method they claimed had been effective in antiquity. Yet knotting cords—what is its origin? Was it not a means for people to trust one another in a time when written records did not yet exist? If their purity and simplicity were intact and no deceit remained, why would they need knotted cords at all? Extending this logic, it seems they were merely aspiring to create written contracts (*书契*) but had not yet reached that stage.\n\nIn the age of unadulterated antiquity, when laws were not yet needed, they still relied upon knotted cords for trust. Yet to say that human deceit had reached its extreme and that laws could not restrain it, while hoping to eliminate all such tools and thus extinguish contention—this is impossible unless *Laozi* himself ruled as sovereign and his disciple, Yin Geng, was appointed alongside Zhuangzi to govern the people. Otherwise, contention would persist.\n\nThus, Zhuangzi lamented his own rhetorical excesses, and at the end of his work, he clarified: *\"周之辞荒唐而说谬悠\"* (The language of Zhou is extravagant and its explanations fanciful). His claim to not betray the Dao rests upon his ability to return to the fundamental principles and harmonize them with the highest truths, reaching only then what may be called sincere discourse.\n\nThose who point to *Laozi*’s teachings as mere nihilism follow only his initial extravagant and fanciful words, unaware of the deeper truths revealed after his harmonization with the highest principles. Confucius and Mencius, whose lives overlapped with *Laozi* and Zhuangzi’s, spoke without restraint. If Confucius or Mencius had encountered such doctrines, they would have systematically refuted them, yet they never did. This is because their differences did not harm their underlying unity.\n\nThe scattered principles of the *Yijing* found in its sixty-four hexagrams were later consolidated in the *Xīcí* (Appendices). Examining *Laozi*’s entire work, his reasoning never strays beyond what is found in the *Xīcí*, nor does he establish any separate doctrine. Judging by his intent, it appears he drew his roots from the *Yijing* and gathered its branches from the upper and lower *Xīcí* (Appendices).\n\nConfucius and Zhuangzi both revered their teachers, yet it is said that *\"孔氏尝即老氏而北面焉\"* (Confucius once stood facing *Laozi* in respect). This claim seems to be an attempt to deflect criticism by exaggerating his own veneration, masking the truth with grandiosity. Later, in the Tang Dynasty, Han Yu took offense at these words and addressed them in his *\"原道\"* (Discourse on the Way), blaming the Confucian scholars for failing to refute them. This was indeed a defense of orthodoxy.\n\nYet my view differs. If there is alignment with the Dao, the Dao cannot be divided—how could one not inherit it? If there is no objection to inheriting, then why should one reject the other? Thus, whether Confucius took *Laozi* as teacher or not is irrelevant.\n\nConfucius once said:\n*\"晋之乘，楚之梼杌，鲁之春秋，其义一也。其事则齐威、晋文，其文则史，其义则丘窃取之矣。\"*\n(The chariot records of Jin, the bamboo annals of Chu, and the Spring and Autumn Annals of Lu all share the same principles. Their events concern figures like Qi Wei and Jin Wen, their texts are historical records, and their meaning is what I have appropriated.)\n\nAgain he said:\n*\"三人行，必有我师焉，择其善者而从之。\"*\n(When three people walk together, there is always one who may be my teacher. I select their good qualities and follow them.)\n\nIf Confucius had truly taken *Laozi* as his teacher, then even upon hearing their words directly, he would have no bias. If *Laozi* were to adopt Confucius’ methods and use them to uphold his own Way, why would his followers’ excessive partiality and overzealous veneration harm their belonging to my school?」\n\nThus, whether one takes Laozi as a teacher or not, his words may be entrusted to ambiguity, yet there are some that cannot but be discerned. Confucius is revered by all ages as the origin of virtue and power, because he gathered the wisdom of the sages and achieved greatness, yet even when his heart wandered, he never transgressed the bounds.\n\nNow, if Laozi were to fabricate words to portray Confucius, and claim that he was arrogant and boastful, while his teachings were not fully exhausted, this would imply that at times Confucius might indeed have surpassed the bounds, yet how could he be worthy of instructing the limitless future generations? This is a harm to Confucius’ deeds and a hindrance to his essence.\n\nFor this reason, the Great Chang thoroughly examined Laozi’s words and exhausted their long-standing interpretations. After careful study, he realized that the two books generally spoke of the Dao and its sequence, often borrowing the language of Confucius and Yan Hui to illustrate shallow analogies. Thus, the reverence of the three sages for Confucius is already profound.\n\nYet their exaggerated claims are not entirely accurate. When Mozi spoke of Yan Hui’s \"seated-forgetting\" (坐忘), comparing it to Confucius, he placed it within the realm of \"ear-obedience\" (耳顺), but in Laozi’s teaching, it becomes a means of self-benefit and self-diminishment.\n\nZhuangzi, in his portrayal of Confucius and Yan Hui conversing, said: \"Yan Hui, I exchanged one arm with you and lost it.\" This implies that Yan Hui could diminish himself but not fully attain the state of non-action (無). Again, he once described Yan Hui’s self-expression as: \"The Master does not speak, yet the people follow; he lacks implements, yet the people pour forth before him.\" Yan Hui was beyond reach.\n\nThe Master (Confucius) dashed away, leaving dust behind, yet Yan Hui could not catch up. Therefore, to diminish further and attain the state of \"non-action yet nothing is left undone\" (無為無不為), only Confucius could truly meet this standard. Here, their hierarchy is clearly distinguishable.\n\nHow could there be a sage whose virtue is outwardly manifested, who already possesses the power of \"not speaking yet being trusted\" and \"neither benefiting nor diminishing\" yet is accused of boastful arrogance? Thus, the books’ treatment of Confucius—sometimes suppressing and sometimes elevating him—generally employs two contrasting approaches to provoke reflection in those who hear only one perspective.\n\nHence, the two sages (Laozi and Zhuangzi) mutually attack Confucius, yet their words do not contradict the Dao, all falling into this category.\n\nThe *Daodejing* divides its text into two volumes, calling them collectively the *Daodejing*—this tradition comes from Wang Bi. The Great Chang believes that this collective title originated from antiquity. Now, the current editions that separately label them as the *Daojing* and the *Dejing* likely reflect later annotations, for even the upper volume speaks of governance and warfare, while the lower volume discusses the unity of Way and virtue, the interplay of hard and soft, and thus fully reveals that virtue and power cannot be divided.\n\nThe numbering of chapters—eighty-one in total—each marked by the first phrase of the chapter to indicate their order, may also be a later addition. Yet the idea that the five thousand words were originally eighty-one teachings must surely come from Laozi himself.\n\nIn each chapter, there are phrases beginning with \"故\" (*gu*—\"thus\"), \"故\" (*gu*—\"thus\"), and \"是以\" (*shìyǐ*—\"therefore\"), all seeking to connect the upper and lower threads, making the words concise yet the meaning complete.\n\nEach chapter’s language has its own starting point, yet the meaning within a single chapter is also interconnected, clarifying the principles. But those who interpret its meaning take each sentence as a separate doctrine, making this sentence incompatible with others, and each chapter as a distinct teaching, making this chapter irrelevant to others—this is not in line with Laozi’s intent.\n\nAs for the naming of chapters, from Wang Bi onward, all subsequent editions align with the current transmitted text, except for He Shang Gong, who emerged in the early Han dynasty, and whose chapter names differ. If Laozi himself had personally set and named them, there would certainly be no such divergence.\n\nThis pattern is evident.\n\nThe teachings of Laozi are indeed profound and difficult to grasp in their utter emptiness. Yet, the Master He Shang [河上公] thoroughly examined the *Dao De Jing* [《道德经》] from beginning to end, revealing patterns and precedents that mutually illuminate each other. When the language of one chapter merely introduces its meaning without concluding it, the subsequent chapter must offer another discourse to bring it to completion. Thus, He Shang’s annotations all clarify their convergence, gathering scattered meanings and preserving them in unity, so that one may see how Laozi, though advocating the \"Way of No-thing\" [谈无], yet in its divisions resembles the *Zhou Guan* [《周官》]'s Six Ordinances [六典]—with general and particular distinctions, large and small details, sequentially permeating each other, and every passage capable of thorough examination. How could this be likened to the hollow, non-existent assumptions of the Zongzi [岂同子虚]?\n\nThose who claim Laozi’s words are mere empty vessels, let them ponder this: the **separation and concealment** [离隐].\n\nLaozi, with his elevated worldly insight, could fathom the depths of the Dao [道奥], having indeed exhausted all that exists in his discourse, yet also allowing his meaning to extend beyond mere words. Thus, there emerged the form of **separation and concealment** [离隐].\n\nWhat is meant by **separation** [离]? It is that a single truth is dispersed across multiple chapters, yet no single chapter fully exhausts it.\n\nWhat is meant by **concealment** [隐]? It is that he speaks of what is so without explaining *why* it is so, hoping that those with profound understanding will grasp it themselves. Hence, his words are like the **Lian Mountains and Duanyu Gorges** [连山断壑], disjointed yet interconnected.\n\nInterpreters who fail to grasp this fall into the error of fragmenting chapters and sentences, leaving the Dao’s principles scattered and incomplete.\n\nConfucius said: *\"Lift one corner and the other three corners will not respond, then I will not teach you again.\"* This is precisely the **separation and concealment** [离隐] he spoke of.\n\nThus, He Shang, in his effort to clarify the corners, dared not to be lax, only seeking to avoid mere dissection.\n\nThose who annotate Laozi’s text in later ages often focus on extracting profound and abstruse phrases, deepening obscurity to the point of making his words seem **lean and cryptic** [廋辞隐语]. Again, like later Buddhist masters discussing *Chan* [禅], leaving readers utterly perplexed.\n\nHe Shang could not fully determine their correctness, but he heard an ancient saying that used painting to criticize worldly habits: *\"Painters delight in depicting ghosts and gods, yet hesitate to paint dogs and horses.\"* Since the skill of painting dogs and horses can be measured, yet ghosts and gods are dim and indistinct—this is why He Shang, whenever he encountered such annotations, would clarify their language and verify them with human affairs, illustrating their success or failure. His explanations were indeed appropriate.\n\nBut if one seeks to borrow obscurity for profundity, hiding within what cannot be interrogated, why not simply refrain from speaking at all?\n\n**He Shang’s annotations and Zhuangzi’s text** [列庄]:\nIn antiquity, there were no annotations or commentaries. If one wished to expound upon earlier works, they would compose a separate book to elucidate them. Hence, the *Liezi* [列氏] and *Zhuangzi* [庄氏]—these two books—stand as the very **explanations of meaning** [义疏] for the *Five Thousand Words* [五千言].\n\nLaozi’s language is concise and austere, not expansive, and his **separation and concealment** [离隐] renders it difficult to immediately comprehend. These two masters, however, elaborated and compiled his teachings.\n\nYet, there are those whose elaborations go too far, veering into **fanciful and unfounded claims** [诞].\n\nStill, their gathering of scattered truths and rendering of clear distinctions—whether concerning the Dao or its manifestations—all find proper resolution.\n\nBy comparing these two masters’ interpretations with those of others, one sees that those who delight in depicting ghosts and gods yet fail to truly recognize them are many.\n\n**General preface and postscript** [大旨序跋]:\n\nThe *Yijing* [《易》] speaks of *\"Heaven’s Mysterious\"* [天玄], and again says *\"the divine\"* [神]—that which subtly encompasses all things and gives rise to speech.\n\nThe Mysterious [玄] is Heaven’s true essence, the divine [神] refers to the unfathomable interplay of *yin* and *yang* [阴阳]. Laozi equates subtlety with the Mysterious; the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious is not the source from which all subtleties emerge?\n\nSu Shi [苏子瞻] composed *The Record of the Hall of All Subtleties* [《众妙堂记》], beginning when he observed a man scattering water and trimming grass, whose hands moved like wind and rain, and whose steps followed perfect measure—then sighed at his skill, and later, using the molting of cicadas and the brooding of hens, described the true subtlety of the Dao [道之真妙].\n\nSuch techniques, though refined, are acquired through practice, not innate genius.\n\nConfucius, when the Duke of Zhou [周] visited Lu during the reign of Duke Zhao [鲁昭公], asked: *\"Have you attained the Dao?\"* If the Dao could be offered to others, then all would present it to their rulers; if it could be transmitted to others, then all would pass it to their descendants. Yet this is impossible, for without an inner master, the Dao cannot be obtained.\n\nHe Shang was invited to serve as the *Cang Shi* [藏室史] in Zhou’s archives, and his son, named Zong [宗], held a military position in Wei. Several generations later, his descendant named Yun [云], still bearing the name Jie [解], became the tutor for the Prince of Jiaoxi [胶西王] during the Han dynasty.\n\nLaozi was not without office nor descendants; yet his profound and subtle teachings were neither presented to his ruler nor transmitted to his progeny. Was this not because the Zhou dynasty was in decline, the great Dao about to vanish, and the only one to record it and leave it to the world was the Prefect of Guan [关令]? Those without inner mastery could never truly hear it.\n\nThe Han Emperor Wen [汉文帝] reigned for twenty-three years, personally cultivating profound silence and relying solely on *virtue* [德] to transform the people—this may be said to encompass all subtleties and attain them.\n\nHe Shang displayed his divine transformations: leaping into the air and soaring through emptiness, only to rest in the Mysterious. If this is what he considered the Mysterious, how could it be Laozi’s Mysterious?\n\nNeither the *Records of the Grand Historian* [《史记》] nor the *History of the Han* [《汉书》] record him, and there is good reason for this.\n\nMaster Liu Yuewu [刘月屋], the overseer of the *Xuanmiao Guan* [玄妙观] in Changde [常德路], compiled annotations on the *Dao De Jing*, which Qian Zhi [钱梓] regarded as a beacon for the distant transmission of the teachings. This was indeed a scholar with aspirations toward contemplating the Mysterious.\n\nThus, I recount what I have heard to inform you, so that you may verify it with the renowned sages of the world.\n\nIn the winter of the third year of Yuan Zheng [元贞丙申孟冬], on the day after the full moon, I observed the rituals of the recluse Mr. Ba [居士巴] in the Chuan Yang [辰阳] region, seeking to clarify the Dao’s subtleties and concealments.\n\nIn ancient times, our Laozi transmitted the *Dao De Jing* [《道德经》] to the world, its profound principles deep and obscure, not merely for the sake of teaching and guiding others. Across generations, enlightened rulers and great scholars have all annotated and studied its subtleties, passing it down endlessly from ancient to modern times. Even Daoists today recite its core text, yet still fear they do not fully grasp its intent. Without consulting the annotations of various masters, how could one truly penetrate the depths of its mysteries?\n\nThe sage **Yongyi** once delved into its hidden depths yet never fully grasped its essence, always devoting himself wholeheartedly to gathering annotations from a hundred schools, probing their profound meanings, and intending to compile a *Ji Yi* [《集义》] to share with like-minded seekers. Now, through the generosity of **Ding Bianxiu** of Shitan, whose family treasures contained the annotations of eminent scholars, combined with the books held by **Yongyi** himself, he has compiled all eighty-one chapters into thirty-one volumes.\n\nThe cost of printing and binding was immense, beyond what one alone could bear, so he joined his disciples **Zhao Yizhuang** and **Liu Yijian** in traveling widely, soliciting contributions from officials, scholars, and Daoist priests alike, thus fulfilling this noble endeavor. Over a span of more than ten years, he never forgot it, even in moments of rest or repose. Now, through his tireless effort, the work is complete. Upon revisiting and savoring its depths, he affirms it as truly refined, profound beyond measure.\n\nIf emperors and nobles adhere to it, their realm will flourish, and the world will know peace;\nIf ministers and officials uphold it, they will be loyal to their sovereign and filial to their kin;\nIf scholars and commoners embrace it, they will return to simplicity and sincerity;\nIf Daoists embody it, they shall transcend the mundane and attain sainthood—\nThis is the Dao, this is virtue/power,\nBefore Heaven and Earth, its beginning is unseen;\nAfter Heaven and Earth, its end is unseen.\n\nIs this not the meaning of this *Jing*?\n\nTo all my fellow seekers who uphold and cherish it, I pray you do not neglect it.\n\nThe Great Virtue of the third year, in the cycle of *ji-hai*, on the late evening of the Upper Element Festival, the humble Sima Weiyong penned this postscript in coarse robes.\n\nThe *Laozi* is nothing but an attempt to emulate Heaven. Indeed, Heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows Nature. When it says, *\"All things arise without claiming merit, give birth without possession, act without reliance, and complete their work without taking credit,\"* these four phrases—though differing in degree—are the very voice of the Sage.\n\nFor Heaven does not claim merit in creating all things, yet it gives birth without possession—its generative intent fills Heaven and Earth, yet it never claims the deed as its own. It acts without reliance—its work pervades Heaven and Earth, yet it never boasts of its power. Its deeds are never undone, yet it does not dwell upon completion—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nWhen it says *\"not striving,\"* *\"not seeing what is desirable,\"* it is to keep the heart undisturbed. When it says *\"stillness and tranquility are the rectification of the world,\"* it is nothing but emulating Heaven. Thus, when I do nothing, the people transform themselves; when I love stillness, the people rectify themselves; when I have no affairs, the people grow wealthy; when I have no desires, the people return to simplicity. These are the verifiable effects of *wuwei*.\n\nTo expound the *Laozi*, one must not depart from emulating Heaven, from Nature, from stillness and *wuwei*—otherwise, there is no ground for words. Thus, in my humble attempt to elucidate the *Laozi* through these principles alone, perhaps I have glimpsed its intent.\n\nOne day, the revered Xuanmiao Sima Yuewu showed me his *Laozi* commentary, written at Shitan, and asked me to add annotations. I said: *\"My ancestor, the Preceptor of Ying, has already devoted great effort to this text. The Master of Po has praised it, saying that if such a work had existed in the Warring States, there would have been no Shang Yang or Han Fei; if it had existed in the early Han, Buddhism and Daoism would not have been divided.\"* Even Cheng Taihe admired its excellence. How could I dare to surpass my ancestor’s insights with my own?\n\nYuewu said: *\"The principles of the text are boundless—how could one exhaust its depths without ceaseless exploration, like water flowing endlessly?\"* Unable to refuse, I reluctantly undertook the task. After many days, the work was complete—sufficient in scope, though I could never hope to follow in my ancestor’s footsteps. I humbly present this, hoping that readers will understand my intent and not fault my presumption.\n\nWritten on the eve of the Double Ninth Festival by the former scholar-official, Respectful Quietness, Su Qizong.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* of five thousand words, with over a hundred commentaries, who truly knows the heart of the Supreme Venerable?\n\nIn the year *Zhi Yuan* of the *Renwu* cycle, the Dao was obstructed by the times, the text reduced to ashes by fire—only the five thousand words remained intact. Was it not fate that preserved the *Lü Lingguang* alone? Those clad in yellow headgear chanting morning and evening, yet some still stumble over sentence structure—I privately sighed deeply, not shirking presumption, and corrected its errors while elucidating its meaning.\n\nAt the time, I exchanged letters monthly with the Stone Pool Master, who requested this work, so I recorded it and sent it to him. Upon his first reading, he praised it. In the year *Xinmao*, I was honored to present the *Yi* and *Lao* texts as a tribute, earning the title of \"Ancient Scholar.\"\n\nIn the summer of *Bingshen*, Master Chang Wu of the *Zhao* clan, Zhao Guandao, came to rectify the essential principles of learning, showing me the Stone Pool Master’s two works. He instructed me to place my newly published *Dao De Jing* commentary—written in vernacular style—among the other interpretations, and entrusted me with further revisions. I was astonished, then fell ill with shock. Having already set the text to print, I could not retract my labor.\n\nIn the summer of *Jihai*, I braved the heat to visit the Stone Pool Master, but his printing was only two-thirds complete, and the Stone Pool Master himself had already become an ancient. Amid my sorrow, I reflected on the sayings of \"wooden drill piercing stone, grinding bricks into mirrors,\" and composed this in ancient style, urging perseverance to resolve this grand case.\n\nWhat mortals desire, Heaven grants—this text’s survival is Heaven’s will. That all interpretations converge into one to ensure immortality is also Heaven’s will. Can mortals defy Heaven? The foolish thus begin and end by attributing all to Heaven.\n\nBefore departing, the Stone Pool Master requested an epilogue, so I appended these words to the end. This autumn, the seventh month, the former scholar-official, Respectful Clarity, Yue Qingzhong, wrote this.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* encompasses Heaven and Earth in its vastness, yet delves into the minutest details—its language is concise, yet its meaning profound. How could a mere jade box or golden key unlock its depths so hastily?\n\nFrom ancient to modern, commentaries and poetic interpretations abound, each with its merits, yet often omitting what others grasp—like eight musical tones discordant, failing to achieve harmony. The Stone Pool Master, Liu Weiyong, compiled the five thousand words into thirty-one volumes, gathering seventy-eight commentaries—whether from Daoists, Confucians, Buddhists, recluses, or the obscure—even the most ethereal phrases of the *Luanbi* style were not discarded. In a single glance, one enters a treasure house: gold, pearls, coral, ivory, rhinoceros horn, mercury, cinnabar, green herbs—jade slips scattered in myriad forms. Was this not the culmination of all interpretations?\n\nAlas, this text was not composed by Master Guanyin in a single revelation—his contribution was immense, yet Master Liu’s achievement is no lesser. Though the Supreme Venerable upholds *wuwei* as his principle, those who recite this text, through seventy-eight schools and countless words, arrive at the five thousand words, then at one word, then at no-word—like the Dragon and the Old Man of the South, they ascend effortlessly to the void, exclaiming, *\"The child is teachable.\"*\n\nGreat Virtue, *Gengzi* month, the eighth day after the full moon, the Heavenly Master’s successor, the Great Substance, Broad Dao, True Person Zhang Yucai, wrote this epilogue.\n\n*The Dao De Jing*’s grand essence and comprehensive meaning conclude here.",

virtue stores me; form shapes me; power perfects me—this is the marvelous work.\n\n**The Great Emptiness Begins with One Diagram**\nThe boundless Dao, void and natural, gives rise to One *Qi*, congealing into *Hun-Dun* (Chaos), within which the Three Powers are contained.\nOnce the Three Powers are divided, the upper and lower positions are established—not through sensation, but naturally.\nThus it is said: *The Void is natural.*\n\nThe Dao originates from the Void, and from this One *Qi*, the myriad things are generated to fulfill daily needs, without end.\n\n**The Nine Heavens Generate the Spirit Diagram**\nGreen, yellow, and white each generate three heavens—three threes make nine heavens.\nEach of the nine heavens generates three heavens—three nines make twenty-seven heavens.\nCombined with the three palaces of Metal, Fire, and Earth, totaling nine heavens, there are thirty-six heavens.\n\n*The Scripture of the Primordial Arrangement of Heaven* states:\n*\"The Primordial Origin’s *Qi* pervades the luminous body, and the Three *Qi* transform into form, manifesting the Three Caverns.\nThe first is the Azure Light, born in the Heavenly Primordial, the second is the White Light, born in the Human Mysterious, the third is the Yellow Light, born in the Earthly Primordial.\nFrom these three colors, the Nine Lights are generated.\nThe Partial Arising of the Dharma-Body shines resplendently.\nNow, detailing the origins of the Three Pure Ones, from the three colors, the Three Treasures are divided—all derived from One *Qi*.\nThus, the Great Void begins with One, One *Qi* divides into Three, establishing the *Qi*, colors, and forms of the Three Pure Ones.\nHence, the Three Pure Ones are called *Natural*.\nNeither father nor mother, neither yin nor yang, they inherit the natural *qi* and give rise to the Three Extremes.\"\n\nThe Venerable Lord Laozi, across kalpas of transformation, manifests in heaven and earth, sometimes taking fetal form—his origin lies in the Three *Qi*’s divided lights forming the Three Pure Ones.\n\n**The Nine-Colored Treasure Lights**\nAt first, *Hun-Hun* becomes the Azure Light.\n*Hun* generates *Dong-Dong*, becoming the Red Light.\n*Dong* generates *Hao-Hao*, becoming the Azure Light.\n*Yuan* generates *Hao-Hao*, becoming the Green Light.\n*Hao* generates *Jing-Jing*, becoming the Yellow Light.\n*Jing* generates *Dun-Dun*, becoming the White Light.\n*Xuan* generates *Rong-Rong*, becoming the Purple Light.\n*Rong* generates *Yan-Yan*, becoming the Azure Light.\n*Yan* generates *Yan-Yan*, becoming the Black Light.\n\nFrom this, the Four Heavens of the East (East华), South (South极), West (West灵), and North (North真) are divided.\nEach heaven generates eight heavens—such as the Great Sovereign, Yellow Ancestor, etc.\nFour eights make thirty-two heavens, which are the Three Realms.\nCombined with the four heavens above, there are thirty-six heavens.\nThe Great Luo and Middle Luo together make seventy-two, corresponding to the numbers of heaven and earth.\nThe seventy-two constellations, combined with the nine heavens above, form the eighty-one *Tai-Xuan*.\nThe Four Regions and Clans take this number.\n\n**The Four Beginnings Diagram**\nEarth obtains the number five as its root number, and also obtains four numbers, including one from Water, making five in total.\nEarth corresponds to the *Kun* hexagram, divided into twelve—also called One *Qi*.\nThus, the Twelve Radiant Ones are opened to encompass the beginning.\n\n**The Diagram of Responding to the Heart’s Use**\nThe True Person’s Precept:\nImagine the Twenty-Eight Constellations encompassing the body to assist the Seven Governors.\nFollowing this method, each constellation spans thirteen degrees, storing an imagined year’s *gui* (retreat), calculating two degrees, alternating counts—twelve places, each storing two constellations, except the Heart, which stores four, totaling twenty-eight.\nThis is no other than pointing to the Dao generating the Mysterious Homeland, responding to the heart’s use—thus, the four central ones begin with the Void Constellation.\n\n**The Dao-Generates-One Diagram**\nHeaven’s arrangement of the Three Celestial Marks and command over all things is all from the Dao.\nThe Dao, without end or beginning, generates from the Mysterious Homeland.\nAccording to the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Child corresponds to the Void Constellation—One *Qi* returns to the Yellow Palace, then disperses, then generates, and all things receive their mandate here.\nThus, the Void is the Dao, and the Dao generates from the Void.\nConsidering heaven, the Void lies in the Mysterious Homeland’s profound darkness, and the Dao generates One.\nAmong the Twenty-Eight Mansions, the Void Constellation exists, and the twelve palace divisions include the Water Jar—speaking of the统 (unification) of Primordial *Qi*.\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* states: In heaven, it is the Mysterious; on earth, it is the Female; in humanity, it is the Dao—this is because thunder returns to the Shocking.\n\n**The Mysterious Female Diagram**\n**The Heavenly Gate’s Opening and Closing: Guarding the Feminine Diagram**\nThe Dao is One.\nOne transforms into Three, becoming *Qian* (Creative)—*Qian* is yang.\n*Qian* interchanges and transforms into *Kun* (Receptive)—yin and yang wax and wane, transforming here.\n*Wei* and *Hai* intermingle, *Qian* and *Kun* naturally unite—male does not depart from female; this is the Dao of Heaven.\nHumans who embody this align with the Dao’s use.\n\n**The Thirteen Birth-and-Death Diagram**\n**The Thirteen Methods of Seizing Life to Avoid Death Diagram**\nThe Venerable Lord says:\nTrue Water and True Fire correspond to the Dao’s true body and cannot be momentarily separated.\nThat which can be separated and yet preserved is neither thing nor person.\nThis meaning is like comparing worldly water and fire.\nTrue Water and True Fire, *Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire) paired, with withdrawal and supplementation governed by principle, used at the proper time—\nthen these thirteen [methods] are not the same as the previous thirteen birth-and-death [cycles].",

      "translated_text": "**From the *Shǐjì* Biographies:**\n\n*\"Old Master (Lǎozǐ) was a native of Lìxiàng, Qǔ County, in Chu—his clan was Lǐ, given name Ěr, courtesy name Bóyáng, with the sobriquet Dān. He served as the Keeper of the Royal Archives in Zhou. When Confucius visited Zhou and sought to inquire about rites from Old Master, the latter replied: ‘What you speak of—both the man and his bones—have long since decayed, yet his words remain. Moreover, a noble one, when the time is right, rides in a carriage; when the time is not, he travels in a humble cart. I have heard: a skilled merchant probes hidden treasures as if they were empty; a virtuous sage, though his power is great, appears as though foolish. This is all I have to tell you.’\n\nConfucius departed and said to his disciples: ‘I know how birds fly, how fish swim, how beasts run. Those that run may be ensnared, those that swim may be hooked, those that fly may be struck with arrows. But as for the dragon—I cannot know how it rides the winds and clouds to ascend to heaven. Today, I have seen Old Master—he is like the dragon!’\n\nOld Master cultivated virtue and the Dao, devoting himself to obscurity and namelessness. After long residence in Zhou, seeing its decline, he departed westward. At the Pass, the Gatekeeper Yín Xǐ said: ‘Master, you are about to withdraw. Please write a book for me.’ Thus Old Master composed the *Dàodéjīng* in two sections, expounding the meaning of virtue and the Dao in over five thousand words, and then departed—none knew his ultimate fate.\n\nLater texts state: Old Master lived to over a hundred and sixty, or perhaps over two hundred, due to his cultivation of the Dao and longevity. One hundred and twenty-nine years after Confucius’ death, the Zhou Grand Historian Xiān saw Qin Xiàn Gōng and said: ‘When Qin first separated from Zhou, it will reunite after five hundred years, and after seventy years of unity, a sovereign ruler will arise.’ Some say this ‘Xiān’ was Old Master; others deny it—none know for certain. Old Master was a hidden sage.\n\nOld Master’s son was named Zōng, who served as a general for Wèi and was ennobled at Duàngān. Zōng’s son was Zhù, Zhù’s son was Gōng, and Gōng’s great-grandson Jiǎ served under Emperor Wén of Hàn. Jiǎ’s son Jiě became the Grand Tutor to the King of Jiāoxī, and the family settled in Qí. Those who studied Old Master disparaged Confucian learning, and Confucian scholars likewise disparaged Old Master. ‘Different paths do not conspire together’—is this not so?\"\n\n---\n\n**Ge Xianweng’s Preface:**\n\n*\"Old Master’s essence is the spontaneous unfolding of Nature itself. Born before the Primordial Void, arising without cause, traversing the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth—unfathomable, without termination, without limit, without extremity. Thus, without extremity, he aligns with the Great Dao to transform and give birth to Heaven and Earth, establishing roots and dispersing qi across the Ten Directions. Embracing the purest essence of virtue and the Dao, vast and boundless, beyond naming. Resplendent with its patterns, majestic in its achievements, profound beyond measure, august as the sovereign of the numinous. The Three Lights shine by its radiance; Heaven and Earth draw life from it; the Celestial Stems and Terrestrial Branches emit their essence through it. Lofty yet without subjects, noble yet without rank, encompassing without end—it teaches the Eight Directions of the heavenly hosts, universally propagating the Great Dao. Before the opening of creation, it descended to become the national teacher, generation after generation without cease. None can fathom its craftsmanship in forming the myriad things; it does not claim credit for its mysterious virtue. Thus, all sages revere it in common.\n\nThe Dao is honored, virtue is exalted—yet none commands it, for it is ever naturally so. Only Old Master embodies this.\n\nIn the Zhou era, it was said that the divine Li Mother gave birth to him by splitting her left armpit, and he emerged radiant, thus named Old Master. The title ‘Old Master’ arose from the Mysterious, existing before Heaven and Earth, beyond the bounds of decay and aging—hence the name. Though the world supposes Old Master originated in the Zhou, his title began in countless eons past, profound and obscure, distant beyond measure.\n\nAs the Dao declined and was not practiced, Old Master traveled westward across the world. At the Pass, Gatekeeper Yín Xǐ said: ‘The Great Dao is about to withdraw—please write a book for me.’ Thus he composed the *Dàodé* in two sections, five thousand words, as the upper and lower scriptures.\n\nThese five thousand words expound the source of virtue and the Dao, encompassing the great without omission, the minute without exclusion—the natural scripture of Heaven and humanity. My former master said: ‘If one diligently studies it, the voice harmonizes with the Supreme Ultimate, ascending in distant chant. The celestial hosts rejoice and invite the Mysterious Adepts. In quiet contemplation, seeking the True, all wonders converge. Observing form and shadow within, the spirit-qi endures eternally. Aligning with virtue and the Dao, all spirits submit; calamity vanishes from the Nine Shades, blessings arise in the Ten Directions, the nation is secure, the family is at peace—who can know this?\n\nThe text of *Wuwei* is not defiled by stagnation, nor adorned by glory, nor corrupted by obstruction, nor purified by clarity—it is natural. It manifests in response to the Dao, its teaching endless, its constancy unchanging. Thus, knowing constancy is enlightenment.\n\nWhat does the Great Dao accomplish? Its propagation depends on humanity. This sublime tradition—how can one not study it with utmost precision? A rough draft is offered here; only those of the Dao will treasure it. This section is not yet pure, yet preserved due to its long transmission.\"\n\n---\n\n**Tang Emperor Xuānzōng’s Imperial Preface:**\n\n*\"Old Master was the inner title of the Supreme Primordial Emperor of the Dao. The Primordial Ancestor of the Dao descended and was born in Yí. Reverent and august, he commanded the clan name ‘Táng.’ His blessings extended without bound, his auspices far-reaching, his lineage unbroken like the gourd-vine. His traces of departure and return are fully recorded in the annals.\n\nThe Daoist tradition holds he was the Morning Pearl of Jade; Sima Qian called him a hidden sage. Yet Confucius took him as teacher, and in the *Analects*, he sighed at the dragon-like virtue of Old Master—thus, Confucius held no reservations.\n\nAfter long service in the Zhou court, he prepared to enlighten the western reaches, and Gatekeeper Yín Xǐ requested he write a book.\"*",

Nothing escapes this principle.\n\nIts essence lies in **governing the self and governing the state**.\nTo govern the state, one must abandon arrogance and ostentation, embracing **non-action** and **non-speech** as doctrine;\nTo govern the self, one must minimize private desires, striving for **emptiness of heart** and **fullness of belly** as primary concerns.\nWhen comparing its grand intent, its meaning may be articulated.\n\nYet when delving into **exhausting principles and perfecting nature**, severing attachments and stilling thoughts, abiding in reality while practicing flexibility, attaining **sitting-forgetfulness** and discarding illumination—**reducing further, refining further**, reaching the **mystic yet deeper**—this is indeed beyond articulation or transmission.\n\nIts teachings are **circular**, its text **concise**, its intent **unobstructed**, its words **universal**; thus, those who wander its halls all deem themselves to have ascended to the chamber and glimpsed its depths.\nYet upon meticulous study and profound contemplation, they then realize that even at the finest hair’s end, they have not grasped even a ten-thousandth part of it.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\n*\"There exists a primal unity, born before Heaven and Earth.\nI know not its name; I call it Dao.\nForced to name it, I call it Great.\nThus, those who know the Great Dao grasp its **ultimate emptiness** and **mystic origin**—this is the forced name for its universal generation.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"At the beginning, there was the Non-being.\nThe Non-being—this is to say, the being is compared to the ineffable Non-being.*\nAgain, it says:\n*The Non-being has no name.\nThe unnamed—this is before any forced naming.*\nThus, the *Classic* says:\n*The Unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe forced name for universal generation is Dao.*\nThus, the *Classic* says:\n*The Named is the mother of all things.*\nAgain, *Zhuangzi* says:\n*When things obtain life, this is called virtue.*\nVirtue—this is *obtaining*.\nSpeaking of Heaven and Earth’s myriad transformations and boundless reach, all things draw upon the **mystic origin** to take form and be born; obtaining life is virtue.\nThus, the *Classic* says:\n*The Dao generates it; virtue nurtures it.*\nThen, those who know the Dao embody virtue, and virtue is the manifestation of the Dao.\nYet the *Classic* divides into upper and lower sections, first clarifying Dao and then virtue.\nHowever, though the names of *body* and *function* may be separated, their essence cannot be divided.\nThus, the *Classic* says:\n*Same origin, differing names—this is called the Mystic.\nSpeaking of its origin, it splits into two; speaking of its unity, it merges as one.\nThus, it is said: separable in name, inseparable in essence.*\n\nThen, the *Upper Classic* says: *This is called Mystic Virtue*, again: *The vastness of virtue’s capacity*, again: *Virtue aligns with virtue*, again: *Constant virtue never departs.*\nThe *Lower Classic* says: *Only when Dao is lost does virtue arise*, again: *Return is the movement of Dao*, again: *Dao generates the One*, again: *The Great Dao is most easy.*\nThus, it is known that *body* and *function* alternate in exposition, each elucidating the core essence, without rigidly fixing their names to upper or lower sections.\n\n*Classic*—this is the **direct path**, also the **constant way**, speaking of the Dao that universally traverses the direct and the enduring.\n\nEach time I reflect upon the sacred ancestor’s teachings, bequeathed to his descendants for contemplation, in moments of rest from governance, I humbly devoted myself to its study.\nNow, I further elucidate its essential mysteries in brief, for the written word cannot exhaust speech; I roughly outline the grand framework to aid those who seek.\n\nDu Guangting’s Preface to *Zhūtāo Yùzhé* states:\nThe **Supreme Primordial Lord** descended and manifested his teachings in four stages, far and near.\n\nThe first: across countless eons, he assumed forms and adapted his transformations according to the age, encompassing the thousand-two-hundred titles and one-hundred-eighty names scattered throughout the scriptures, which may be verified.\n\nThe second: at the dawn of the Kaihuang era of this eon, he fulfilled the cosmic function, nurturing Heaven and Earth, gestating the sun and moon as the foundation of transformation, the root of Heaven and Earth. He dispersed **qi** and partitioned light, generating all things. From the first of the Five Sovereigns to before the Yin and Shang dynasties, he served as the teacher of emperors, appearing in each generation—such as **Yùhuá, Lǜtú, Guǎngchéng, and Yínshòu**, who revealed his presence through the times.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns passed, the Five Emperors did not return; the **Dragon Sage of the Cloud Records** shifted with the ages, his steps varying—**Yàotáng** grew weary of his position in old age, **Yúshùn** endured trials before ascending to rule. He governed the myriad lands, diligently attending to all affairs.\n\nOld Lord was named **Yínshòu’s son**, residing in **Héyáng**, and transmitted the *True Classic of Dao and Virtue* to **Shùn**. This was the intent of the scripture.\nDao takes precedence in **non-action**; virtue follows in **having a name**.\nThis is also why the books of the Three Sovereigns speak of the **Great Dao**, while those of the Five Emperors speak of the **Constant Dao**.\n\nBelow this, he trimmed excessive rituals, combined the **love-extending** principle, reduced **bowing and deferential etiquette**, curbed **sharp cleverness**, rejected **military violence**, and suppressed **deceptive schemes**, guiding people back to **primordial simplicity and purity**, treating **non-action** as the ultimate governance.\n\nShùn had to exert force to implement this, exiling the wicked and appointing ministers, sharpening his senses, harmonizing the nine clans, and clarifying the people’s affairs—yet the **serene and pure Dao** could not be fully realized.\n\nThus, after **Yǔ and Tāng**, the world became a family possession, each cherishing their own kin. The Great Dao having faded, the **mystic transformation** no longer flowed; rituals and music grew elaborate, and laws and punishments were widely applied.\n\nThe third: the Lord descended as a divine manifestation during the **Xīnzhāo era of the Shang**, taking form in the year of **Wǔdīng**, born in **Bó**—today’s **Zhēnyuán County’s Jiǔlóngjǐng, Tàiqīng Palace**. Sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed, he subtly transformed the myriad lands. In the **Gengchǒu year of King Zhāo of Zhou**, he transmitted these two classics to **Emperor Yín Xǐ**, spreading them across the world, so that all could hear of them.\n\nThe fourth: he prepared to transform the **Western Wastes**, meeting **Emperor Yín Xǐ** at the **Qīngyáng Market in western Shǔ** to manifest his birth—this was the **Dīnsì year of King Zhāo**. This is the *Dao De Jing* transmitted from **Hánguān Pass**, revered and practiced across generations.

Now I understand that **Confucianism and Buddhism** are one **Dharma**.\"*\n\nI laughed and said:\n*\"No, that is not so.\nThere is but **one Dao/Way** under heaven, yet the means of governing people differ.\nBetween **sovereign and minister, father and son**, without **rites and laws**, there is chaos.\nTo know **rites and laws** yet not the **Dao/Way** is the failing of vulgar Confucians, unworthy of esteem.\nTo dwell in the mountains and forests, eating grain and drinking from streams, yet harboring the **Supreme Dao/Way**, one may become a teacher to both **humans and celestial beings**—yet to govern the world with this would bring disorder.\nThe ancient **Sages** held the **Dao/Way** in their hearts and practiced it, yet did not reject the laws of the world—only then could they be so.\"*\n\nMaster Quán bowed in reverence, saying:\n*\"This is profound discourse indeed.\"*\n\nAt that time, I was studying the *Laozi*, and whenever I expounded a chapter, I showed it to Master Quán.\nHe would always exclaim:\n*\"All of this is the **Buddha’s teaching**!\"*\n\nI resided in Jùn for five years before returning north; Master Quán soon passed away.\nNow, more than twenty years have passed.\nWhenever I revised my *Commentary on the Laozi*, it never failed to align with the **Buddha-Dharma**.\nSince no one else could converse with me on this, I longed to see Master Quán again and show it to him.\nThus, I inscribed this at the end of the *Laozi*.\n\nIn the second year of **Great Observation** [大观], on the tenth day of the twelfth month, **Zǐyóu** [子由] inscribed this.\n\nIn my youth, when I was exiled to **Hǎikāng** [海康], I encountered my elder brother **Zǐzhān** [子瞻] by chance in **Téng Prefecture** [藤州].\nWe traveled together for over ten days, discussing our past studies.\nZǐzhān said to me:\n*\"Your works on *Poetry*, the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, and *Ancient History* are all beyond what ancient scholars achieved.\nOnly your *Commentary on the Laozi* falls slightly short.\"*\n\nUpon arriving in Hǎikāng, with leisure and no other duties, I revised all my writings.\nI then recopied the *Laozi* commentary and sent it to Zǐzhān.\nAfterward, by imperial favor, I returned north.\nZǐzhān fell ill in **Pílíng** [毗陵] and did not recover.\nNow, over ten years have passed, and I still do not know whether he approved of this book.\n\nIn the winter of the first year of **Political Harmony** [政和], I received from my nephew **Mài** [迈] and others the compilation of *My Late Father’s Writings* [《先公手泽》].\nAmong them was this:\n*\"Yesterday, Zǐyóu sent me *The New Commentary on the Laozi*.\nI read it through in one sitting and, closing the volume, sighed deeply.\nIf this book had existed in the **Warring States**, there would have been no **Shāng Yáng** or **Hán Fēi**.\nIf it had existed in the **Han’s early years**, **Kǒng** and **Lǎo** would have been one.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Dao of Laozi sought to ride the clouds and qi, to ascend and bend the boundless,\nto gaze beyond the eight wilds, deeming human affairs unworthy to weigh upon his mind.\nYet now his text speaks much of governing the state and loving the people,\nof wielding armies and leading troops, descending even to the minutiae of carriages and tools—\nindeed, it is mostly metaphorical speech.\n\nLaozi and Zhuangzi are one. One knows Zhuangzi’s use of metaphor,\nyet does not know it originated from Laozi.\nThus, readers of *Laozi* often miss its true intent.\n*Laozi* says:\n*\"Know its masculine, hold to its feminine.\"*\nAgain:\n*\"The spirit of the Valley does not die—this is called the mysterious female.\"*\nAgain:\n*\"And yet, it prizes seeking nourishment from the Mother.\"*\nWhy does *Laozi* value the feminine, the female, and the Mother?\nAll are metaphorical speech.\nAmong the eighty-one chapters, such cases are not few—\nyet he wished to align with Confucius and Mencius’ Six Classics,\nso it was inevitable that their meanings would clash.\n\nI have pondered this text for many years,\ndevoted to exploring Laozi’s intent,\nand composed annotations to clarify it.\nWhere my understanding was incomplete,\nI drew upon *Liezi*, *Zhuangzi*, *Yijing*,\nand other Daoist writings,\nhoping to pierce the chaos of darkness,\nto dissect the vast and formless,\nso that those who come after may grasp its truth.\n\n**Xie Tunan’s Preface**:\nThe Dao has its scriptures, ancient in origin.\nBefore the union of the blue ox and purple breath,\nbefore the opening of the jade [□] and golden keys,\nthere were already the Five Thousand Words,\nrevealing the secrets of the Primordial,\nexpounding the subtle essence of the Fallen.\nMysterious beyond measure, divine beyond reckoning—\nonly those on the Dao can truly know it.\n\n*Laozi*’s eighty-one chapters,\nits words also numbering Five Thousand,\nare the continuation of its lineage,\nflowing together in harmony—\ntruly, all are the natural expression of the Dao.\nExtending it further,\none refines the self to govern the state,\ngoverns the state to pacify the world—\nand the Dao of governance is fulfilled.\nPursuing it deeper,\none refines the self to cultivate the spirit,\ncultivates the spirit to ascend—\nand the Dao of transcendence is fulfilled.\n\nZhang Ping’s verse says:\n*The *Yinshu* treasure exceeds three hundred,*\n*the *Daode*’s sacred words are but Five Thousand.*\n*Since ancient times, the divine and immortal are boundless,*\n*all spring from here, the true path revealed.*\nDid Ping deceive me?\nThough the *signs* are tools to catch fish,\nthe *scriptures* are paths to enter the Dao—\nfish caught, the *signs* may be forgotten;\nthe Dao understood, the *scriptures* are but temporary guides.\n\nTo recite the words of ancient sages\nyet fail to grasp their unspoken meaning\nis still of no benefit.\n\n*The Huangting Neijing* says:\n*\"The divine and immortal are not born with inherent spirit—*\n*they accumulate essence and amass merit to attain true reality.\"*\nAgain:\n*\"Accumulating merit to refine is not natural—*\n*it comes from devotion, from focus and perseverance.\"*\nThe Daoist scholar who devotes his heart\nto essence and focus, enduring without falter,\nhas never failed to succeed.\nYet he fears the reverence not reaching its peak,\nor arrogance and neglect taking hold,\nor faith not being steadfast,\nor carelessness following in its wake.\nThis is why, among a thousand, only one or two may attain it.\n\nIn antiquity, the Yellow Emperor received the *Yinshu*’s intent from Guangcheng Huangren,\nand wept in gratitude.\nGeneral Yan, the Keeper of the Pass, heard the marvels of *Daode* from Li Laojun,\nand wept in reverence, bowing.\nWhy did they weep?\nTheir joy and awe were profound, their gratitude intense.\nYet if this text is so difficult to see,\nand its meaning so hard to grasp,\nwe must bow a hundred times to recite it,\nguard it all our lives,\ntreasure it as the greatest of gems,\ncherish it as the Primordial Qi—\nlet us not neglect it,\nlet us not abandon it.\n\n**Yu Qiongzhong’s Second Preface**, written on **Upper Element Day**, **Renshen Year** of **Chunyu** [淳佑],\nat the **Lian Mountain Celestial Nectar Child**’s **Jingtai Hall**.\n\n**Yu Qingzhong’s Preface**:\nThe great source of the Dao arises from Heaven.\nHeaven cannot speak for itself,\nso it depends upon those who can speak to proclaim it,\nand only then does the Dao’s form emerge.\n\nIf there were no one to speak of it,\nthen the Dao would remain forever concealed.\nDoes Heaven wish the Dao to remain concealed forever?\nThose who can speak of it are rare—\none in a hundred ages.\nIf our Laozi is such a rare one,\nthen Heaven entrusted this Dao to his person.\nThe body is the Dao’s vessel.\nThe Dao is embodied in the person,\nand expressed in words—\nthus the secrets of Heaven and Earth are revealed,\nand the mechanisms of creation are disclosed.\n\nThen there are the *scriptures*,\nwhich record the words,\nand the words carry the Dao—\nthe Five Thousand Words are all the Dao.\nIn truth, they do not depart from one essence,\nscattered through the eighty-one chapters—\nall are the Dao.\nNor do they stray beyond this one essence—\nits refined aspects govern the heart,\nits coarse aspects govern the body,\nits earthly and mundane aspects govern the world and state—\nall stem from this single Dao’s extension.\n\nSince the rise of specialized schools,\neach upholds its own truths,\neach rejects its own falsehoods.\nZi Yun was scorned for his dismissal,\nBan Gu was criticized for his harshness—\nthus my *scripture* was long consigned\nto the ranks of the debased and the heretical,\nyet none considered that though the names of the Three Teachings differ,\ntheir principles are one.\n\nIn ancient times, Su Huangmen annotated this text\nand entrusted it to Dongpo.\nDongpo said:\n*\"Had this text existed in the Warring States,*\n*then there would have been no Shang Yang or Han Fei;*\n*had it existed at the beginning of the Han,*\n*then Confucius and Laozi would have been one;*\n*had it

sacred teachings,\nsupports and nurtures human order.\nAll Daoist writings were burned by imperial decree,\nyet the *Daode* alone stands firm,\nradiant in the world,\nlike the sun shining in Heaven—\nis this not Heaven’s will?\n\nThough the music of Zheng and Wei was discarded,\nthe *Shao* grew more revered;\nthough the tiles lay in ruins,\nthe pearls became more visible.\nHeaven’s intent is clear.\n\nHeaven did not conceal this Dao in the past,\nbut now reveals it grandly,\nwishing that this text be held by families,\nand its meaning grasped by people.\nYet all possess this text,\nyet

Master Lao, the Most August Ancestor of the Mysterious Origin, expounded upon the two *jing* texts, their teachings enduring across ages—originating from the time of Shun, transmitted through the Zhou dynasty, and annotated by over sixty scholars in commentaries and elucidations.\n\nWhen discussing governance, the teachings of the Yan family and the Duke of Lu, as well as Yang Xún’s personal insights, stand unparalleled. For personal cultivation, the *Songling* and *Xiang’er* traditions remain unmatched in their subtlety.\n\nAmong them, Emperor Wu of Liang, Emperor Jianwen, the monk Sengzhao, and the translators Luo Ran, Zang, Tao, and Gu, all flourished in the Southern Dynasties. Ren, Li, and the two Zhangs shone in Western Shu. Yet despite their contributions, some interpretations were flawed, and none fully penetrated the essence.\n\nThus, in the eleventh year of the Kaiyuan era, the Emperor personally annotated and elucidated the text. Having completed the account of the *zhìcù*, the explanation of the main text follows, divided into two parts: first, clarifying the *cù* (疏) title, and second, analyzing the text itself.\n\nThe subsequent exposition is structured into two major divisions of the *cù*:\nFirst, the opening chapter is interpreted, summarizing the overarching themes, further divided into two:\n1. The method of exposition—namely, the two characters *Dao* and *De*.\n2. The teaching that expounds it—the single character *jing*.\n\nThe full interpretation follows; distinctions within the *jing* title will be addressed later.\n\nThese two characters, *Dao* and *De*, encompass the origin of all things, the subtle principles of governing the state and cultivating oneself—all are contained herein.\n\nFormerly, the Daoist Master Ge Xuan addressed Sun Quan, ruler of Wu, saying:\n*The Daode Jing* is the utmost subtlety of heaven and earth. It encompasses the Dao/Virtue of heaven, the Dao/Virtue of humanity, and the Dao/Virtue of the divine. It is boundless in its scope, minute in its reach—worthy of reverence.\n\nWithin this framework, thirty-eight distinct teachings are outlined:\n\n1. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to govern through *wuwei* (無為):**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Abandon the Sage, discard wisdom—benefit to humanity is a hundredfold. Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness—humanity returns to filial piety and affection.\"*\n   *\"Abandon cleverness, discard profit—thieves and robbers will cease to exist.\"*\n   Again: *\"How can one love people and govern the state without *wuwei*?\"*\n   *\"I practice *wuwei*, yet people transform themselves.\"*\n\n2. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to cultivate the Dao/Virtue in the world:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Cultivate the Dao/Virtue in the world, and its power will be universal.\"*\n   *\"Hold fast to the ancient Dao to govern the present.\"*\n   *\"Hold fast to the Great Image, and all under heaven will follow.\"*\n\n3. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to govern with the Dao/Virtue:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Govern the world with the Dao/Virtue—its spirits will not be numinous. Not that its spirits are not numinous, but that they will not harm people.\"*\n   *\"When the Dao/Virtue is absent in the world, warhorses arise at the borders.\"*\n\n4. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to act in accordance with heaven:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Humanity follows the earth; the earth follows the heavens.\"*\n   *\"The Dao/Virtue constantly does nothing yet nothing remains undone. If lords and kings can uphold this, all things will transform of their own accord.\"*\n\n5. **Teaching the Son of Heaven not to disdain the world due to his exalted status:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Hold the body as precious as the world—thus it may be entrusted with the world. Love the body as precious as the world—thus it may be entrusted with the world.\"*\n   *\"How can one who rules a myriad chariots treat the world lightly? To treat it lightly is to lose ministers; to be hasty is to lose the mandate.\"*\n\n6. **Teaching the Son of Heaven not to exalt the worthy nor treasure wealth:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Do not exalt the worthy—thus people will not contend. Do not treasure difficult-to-obtain wealth—thus people will not become thieves.\"*\n   *\"Desire what is undesired; do not treasure difficult-to-obtain wealth.\"*\n\n7. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to transform people through *wuwei* and *wuyu* (無欲):**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Always keep people in a state of ignorance and desirelessness—thus the wise will not dare to act. To act in *wuwei* is to govern without fail.\"*\n   *\"I have no affairs, yet people prosper. I have no desires, yet people return to simplicity.\"*\n   *\"By desirelessness and stillness, the world will rectify itself.\"*\n\n8. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to view all things impartially and not be entangled in achievements:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"Heaven and earth are not benevolent—they treat all things as fodder for the dogs. The Sage is not benevolent—they treat the people as fodder for the dogs.\"*\n   *\"Practice teaching without words.\"*\n   *\"Act without relying on it; when the deed is done, take no credit.\"*\n\n9. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to hold nothing fast nor be obstructed:**\n   The *jing* states: *\"To act is to ruin; to grasp is to lose.\"*\n   *\"Abandon excess, abandon extravagance, abandon excessiveness.\"*\n   *\"The Sage has no fixed heart—taking the hearts of the people as their own.\"*\n\n10. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to found governance on humility:**\n    The *jing* states: *\"The noble takes the lowly as root; the high takes the low as foundation.\"*\n    *\"The seas and rivers reign over all valleys because they excel in descending.\"*\n    *\"Bear the filth of the state—this is the master of the ancestral altars. Bear the misfortunes of the state—this is the king of the world.\"*\n    *\"Great states should act as the lowly. Thus they take the small states.\"*\n    *\"The good ruler employs people as the lowly.\"*\n\n11. **Teaching the feudal lords to govern rightly:**\n    The *jing* states: *\"Govern with rectitude.\"*\n    *\"To govern with wisdom is the ruin of the state. Not to govern with wisdom is the blessing of the state.\"*\n    *\"The difficulty of governing the people lies in their many clever schemes—thus they are difficult to govern.\"*\n\n12. **Teaching the feudal lords to avoid harsh and violent rule:**\n    The *jing* states: *\"To govern a great state is like poaching a small fish. The more the court is frequented, the more the fields lie fallow. The more the granaries are filled, the more the people suffer hunger.\"*",

The words of Laozi can be said to align with the *Yijing*.\nYet he ultimately cannot stand with Confucius and Mencius—why?\nBecause the sage, when speaking of the Dao/Way, never sought to articulate it.\nAll that was spoken of emerged in response to the transformations of the world,\nand was meant only for those of mediocre talent who could not comprehend on their own.\nThough the Dao/Way encompasses both *wu* and *you*,\nwhen spoken of, it emphasizes *you* while neglecting *wu*.\nFor the texts of the *Shijing*, *Shujing*, *Liji*, *Yueji*, and *Chunqiu*\nall serve to elucidate *you*.\nAs for *wu*, only the *Yijing* speaks of it—\nyet even then, its teachings are embedded in the lines, symbols, and judgments,\nin the auspicious and inauspicious, the regrets and cautions,\nso that the learned, observing from above, see the detailed particulars of things\nand grasp their *you*,\nwhile the unlearned, observing from below, perceive the transcendence of instruments and uses\nand grasp their *wu*.\nThus, the wise grow ever more confident in their understanding,\nwhile the foolish, though glimpsing it, do not fall into doubt or error.\n\nFor others have pondered: *\"The subtle Dao/Way is beyond the reach of mediocre minds.\nThose who can grasp it need not speak—it reveals itself.\nIf one fails to measure it thus and insists on speaking of the subtle,\nthen one only confuses the learners.\"*\n\nLaozi understood that *wu* and *you* serve one another,\nand that *wu* is the root, so his words elaborate on *wu* while omitting *you*.\nYet *wu* is beyond speech—how can it be elaborated upon?\nSince Laozi already diverged from Confucius and Mencius,\nRong Zhi further lost the essence of Confucius.\nFor he claimed that *wu* (無) is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nand that the *shen* (神) is the most difficult to name of Heaven and Earth—\nyet the world has already named it *shen*.\nBut is there truly anything without a name?\nAgain, he believed that one must observe the expedient through desire,\nyet great desire is the harm of nature.\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Restrain anger, suppress desire,\"*\nand Laozi also says: *\"Do not see what is desirable, lest the heart be disturbed.\"*\nIf desire exists, one will sink, stray, and lose oneself in pursuing things,\nunable to know what to hold onto—\nhow then can one observe the expedient?\nThis failure to discern leads him to say, *\"I know the completeness of Heaven and Earth,\nthe grand framework of the ancients\"*—\nalas, how laughable!\n\nLiu Zhongping said:\n*\"The constant name is *wu* (無方) as its essence,\nthe constant Dao/Way is *wu* (無體) as its function.\n*Wu* (無方) is without boundaries—nowhere is it not present;\n*wu* (無體) is without form—nothing is beyond its doing.\nIf there is anything it does, then it is not *wu* (無方);\nif there is anything it names, then it is not *wu* (無體).\nThus it is said: *‘The Dao/Way that can be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way;\nthe name that can be named is not the constant name.’*\n\nAt the beginning of the Great Origin, there was *wu* and *you*,\nand *wu* was without name.\nThat which was *wu* and without name—this was the Great Commencement.\nThe Great Commencement is the father of Heaven and Earth,\nso it is said: *‘The unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.’*\nHeaven and Earth are the mothers of all things,\nso it is said: *‘The named is the mother of all things.’*\nTo speak of the mother is to know the father of the beginning,\nwhile to speak of the beginning is to know the mother as the source of life.\nThus, above it is said: *‘the beginning of Heaven and Earth,’*\nand below it is said: *‘the mother of all things.’*\"*",

you’* is simply *wu*.\nWhat is called *‘wu has wu-ming’* is simply *you*-ming.\n\nFor indeed, there is *wu* and *you*, and thus there is the named *you*.\nHence, *wu-ming* is merely *‘the Great Origin of Heaven and Earth.’*\n\nBut above this, there is also the *zu* (祖).\nThe subtle (*miao* 妙) is the root of the Dao/Way,\nthe coarse (*jiao* 徼) is the end of the Dao/Way.\nThe sage’s subtlety, observing it with *constant wu*,\nthe sage’s coarseness, observing it with *constant you*.\n\nThus it is said: *‘Constant wu to observe its subtlety,\nconstant you to observe its coarseness.’*\nThe subtle lies within, the coarse without,\nspeaking of the subtle reveals the coarse as coarse,\nspeaking of the coarse reveals the subtle as within.\nHence, above it is said: *‘constant wu to observe its subtlety,’*\nand below it is said: *‘constant you to observe its coarseness.’*\n\nFor *wu* is *wu* opposed to *you*,\nwhile *constant wu* is not *wu* opposed to *wu*, nor is it *you* opposed to it;\n*you* opposed to *wu* is *you* that is not *wu*,\nwhile *constant you* is not *you* opposed to *you*, nor is it *wu* opposed to it.\nThat which is not *wu* opposed is not *you*,\nthat which is not *you* opposed is not *wu*.\nThus, *constant you* is the true *wu* in essence, yet not *wu*,\nand *constant wu* is the subtle *you* in essence, yet not *you*—\nhence these two are the profound *‘same origin, same return’* (同出而同归).\n\nZhuangzi said: *‘Establish it with constant wu-you,\nspeak of it with the Great Oneness (Tai Yi 太一).’*\nFor indeed, *‘constant wu-you’* (周读) is read as *‘constant wu, constant you.’*\nConstant *wu* is to observe its subtlety,\nconstant *you* is to observe its coarseness.\nBecause one observes its subtlety, it is established with constant *wu*,\nbecause one observes its coarseness, it is established with constant *you*.\nIf one speaks of the coarse and subtle as *‘forgetting and without desire to observe,’*\nthen what is called *‘establish it with constant wu-you’* is simply *‘obscured in mystery’* (冥之).\n\nThis is called *‘yet more profound’* (又玄),\nnot merely the same as called *‘profound’* (玄),\nbut *‘profound yet again profound’* (玄之又玄),\nthe gateway to all subtleties.\n\nThe profound is the essence of subtlety,\nthe subtle is the manifestation of the profound.\nThe subtle is the same origin as that which is not profound.\nLiu Ji (刘骥) humbly believes that Laozi’s discourse on *virtue/power* and *Dao/Way* (道德),\narising from Guan Yin’s (关尹) request,\nwas spoken extemporaneously and written in haste,\nnever divided into ninety chapters.\n\nLater scholars split it into two volumes,\nsymbolizing the subtle and manifest uses of the Two Principles (两仪),\nand eighty-one chapters (九九八十一),\ncorresponding to the ultimate number of the Great One (太阳).\nNow let it be restored as one.\n\nThe two teachings are named *‘Comprehensive Doctrine’* (通论),\nyet the mind is perplexed and cannot comprehend,\nthe mouth is baffled and cannot discuss.\nVast and boundless, it cannot be described or contained.\nIts first chapter begins with *‘The Dao/Way that can be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way,’*\nto show that the Dao/Way cannot be sought with reasoning.\nIts final chapter ends with *‘What cannot be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way,’*\nto show that the Dao/Way cannot be transmitted through words.\n\nDifficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom,\ndifficult to measure, difficult to recognize,\nlooking up, it grows ever higher,\npursuing it, it grows ever more distant.\nOne might think it like ascending to Heaven—\nseemingly unattainable.\n\nYet its essential meaning is no more than\nattaining *extreme emptiness* (虚极),\nand steadfastly preserving *profound stillness* (守静笃).\nIt is very easy to know, very easy to practice.\nYet none in the world can know it,\nnone can practice it,\nto open its *yue* (兑) and aid its affairs.\n\nThe ancient masters who excelled in the Dao/Way\nsealed their *yue* (兑),\nclosed their gates,\nshattered their theories,\ndissolved their confusion,\ntheir minds undisturbed,\nthey dwelled in the Dao,\nreturning to the root of *emptiness and stillness*,\nrecovering the origin of *nature and life* (性命).\nJust as all things arise from the root and return to the root,\nreturning to the root and recovering life,\nnurturing *nature* (性) and reflecting *virtue/power* (德),\nwhen *virtue/power* is attained, it aligns with the beginning,\nreturning to the *pu* (朴),\nin harmony with the Dao’s essence,\n*‘boundless yet without form’* (绳绳兮不可名),\nreturning to *wu-wu* (无物),\nneither born nor extinguished,\nneither self nor name,\nlife and death within oneself,\nentering and exiting without obstruction.\nThus, it is neither seen nor unseen,\nneither revealed nor concealed,\nneither close nor distant,\nneither beneficial nor harmful,\nneither honored nor humiliated—\nand so it can abandon things and transcend people,\nrising beyond Heaven and Earth’s\nyin-yang cycles and cosmic measures.\n\nGreat indeed are the most virtuous sages and divine persons—\nnone can reach them without this gate.\nWhat is known is difficult to speak,\nwhat is practiced is seen with the eyes,\nyet its power is vast while its function is profound.\nThe students must silently recognize and deeply cultivate it.\n\nIf one does not deeply cultivate and attain it oneself,\nbut seeks it through scrutiny,\nor investigates it through debate,\nit is like sitting in a well to observe the sky—\nhow could one hope to glimpse the Dao/Way’s *‘approximate likeness’* (仿髴)?\n\nZhao Shi’an (赵实庵) said:\nThe subtle Dao/Way is boundless and empty,\nestablishing teaching before Heaven’s manifestation,\nthe most true symbolizing the ultimate,\nthe Dragon Han (龙汉) opening the diagram,\nthe lineage of teachers transmitting the transformation—\nto the Three (三).\nThe cycles of *kalpa* (劫) intertwined—\nto the Nine (九).\n\nAt the *Tai Ji* (太极),\nthe primordial unity was first analyzed,\nHeaven and Earth opened, affairs simplified, people pure—\nthe Three Sovereigns (三皇) acted,\ninstituting tools and symbols,\nwithout contrivance or artifice—\nwhat was there of ritual and etiquette?\n\nAs the *kalpa* declined,\npurity was scattered,\nthough scriptures were not yet composed,\nand the profound teachings had not yet shone forth.\nThe initial profound words were first bestowed upon *You Yu* (有虞),\nand completed in the age of governance.\nThe Golden Mouth (金口) transmitted them to the *Ji* (姬) lineage,\nmaking the profound chapters widely manifest.\nThough passed down through a hundred kings,\nthey were also personally transmitted to *Guan Ling* (关令).\n\nIn the time of Emperor Ming (明皇),\nhis imperial commentary was issued by decree,\npreserved in the *Wei Temple* (徽庙),\na grand tradition of the sage’s words illuminating our lineage.\nAt the time, all revered it,\nas if in the *Qi* (始青) era,\nwith blessings extending through generations,\npermanently bright and unbroken.\n\nAs for the annotations and commentaries of a hundred schools,\npiled high like mountains and filling carriages,\neach exhausting their own minds,\nto expound the profound intent—\nnone could follow them so thoroughly as in the Ming era.\nThe Heavenly Mandate not having yet abandoned this learning,\nit is fitting that the world should again flourish in the Dao/Way,\nstill lamenting the neglect of *original learning* (元学) for long ages,\nthus dividing it into three for systematic study,\nso that listeners and observers may have a summary.\n\nDaring to hope that the subtle Dao/Way\nwill be revealed and illuminated,\nI shall now expound this scripture,\nbriefly categorizing it into ten gates (十门) for examination:\n1. The origin and cause of the initial teaching,\n2. The sequence of teaching separation and unity,\n3. The revelation of the doctrine’s essence and its trends,\n4. The Heavenly and human transmission of the lineage,\n5. The Three Realms (三洞) it encompasses,\n6. The scripture’s unique excellences,\n7. The initiation of Dao/Way’s cycles and their periods,\n8. The distinction between comprehensive and particular teachings,\n9. The fulfillment of causes and requests,\n10. The division of chapters based on textual analysis.»",

      "translated_text": "**1. The Origin and Cause of the Initial Teaching**\nThe Classics say: *\"The Dao/Way was established by Fu Xi and perfected by Yao, passed through Shun, Yu, Tang, and reached its fullness in the Zhou. After the reigns of King You and King Li, the Zhou dynasty declined, and by the time of Laozi, the world was chaotic without principles or culture. Sagehood did not arise, recluses spoke recklessly, and the people suffered from violence and poison. Laozi lamented the Zhou’s decline, seeing humanity lose its nature and emotions. He sought to restore them to purity and simplicity, returning to the ancient ways. Thus, he composed the *Classic*, emphasizing sincerity and loyalty, valuing simplicity, diminishing ritual propriety, and rejecting wisdom and sageliness, so that later generations might once again see the purity of Heaven and Earth and preserve the essence of antiquity.*\n\n*Laozi was contemporary with Confucius. When Confucius visited the Zhou to inquire about rites, Laozi spoke earnestly, advocating trust and humility. Confucius, however, focused on ren and yi, traveling tirelessly across the world, yet no ruler of his time could employ him. He sighed, ‘The phoenix does not come, the Yellow River does not reveal its map—I am finished.’ The world assumes that since Laozi lived in the declining Zhou, he did not uphold lofty virtue and the Dao/Way, unaware that Confucius, who openly spoke of ren and yi, also failed to transform his age. Indeed, the Dao/Way is the overarching name for ren and yi. If ren and yi cannot prevail, how can the Dao/Way be attained? Thus lies the origin of this teaching.*\n\n**2. The Sequence of Teaching: Separation and Unity**\nMany speak of the Dao/Way, yet their views reduce to two main schools. One holds that the Dao/Way is *emptiness, tranquility, stillness, and solitude*; the other, that it is *rites, propriety, laws, and governance*. Those who uphold emptiness and tranquility are deemed lofty and refined, while those who follow rites and laws are seen as moderate.\n\nThe lofty and refined withdraw into secluded cliffs, dwelling in desolation, offering no benefit to the world—abandoning themselves to uselessness. Though the world is vast, they discard it like worn-out shoes, refusing even a speck of worldly concern, standing aloof as *perfected beings*.\n\nThe moderate, however, are scholars of governance: they refine rites and music, rectify human relationships, standardize measures and weights, and establish laws. The world relies on them for order—they are those who *practice the Dao/Way to benefit the age*. Though they dwell within the realm of civilization, they are called *virtuous persons*.\n\nOnce these two paths are fixed, they seem as irreconcilable as ice and fire. Alas, can this truly be the understanding of the Great Dao/Way? It is the fault of unreflective minds.\n\nIn truth, the lofty and the moderate both stem from the same Sage’s Dao/Way and heart. The Sage embodies complete virtue, and from this unity arise both inner sageliness and outer kingship—never two separate paths. What was called *emptiness, tranquility, and solitude* is not merely a means of detachment but a cultivation of the three virtues.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says: *\"Meng nourishes the upright—this is the Sage’s achievement.\"* Hidden yet not revealed, it is called *inner sageliness*; manifest in action, it is called *outer kingship*. Emptiness is the source of all utility; tranquility, the essence of harmony for the world; stillness, the mechanism of motion. When virtue is complete here, one may govern the world.\n\nThus, when things accumulate, there arise rites; when carved, there arises propriety; when emotions are regulated, there arise laws; when observed, there arise measures. Only then does the path of governance become fully illuminated.\n\nInitially, it does not depart from nature. To exhaust nature is to know Heaven; to clarify nature is to grasp the Dao/Way. The *Book of Yao* calls Yao *\"reverent, enlightened, and thoughtful\"*—his governance was called *wuwei*. The achievements of *wuwei* all originate from the Dao/Way. How could the Dao/Way and the world be fundamentally divided?\n\nEmotions arise from nature; nature, when fractured, becomes emotion—like water disturbed into waves, which, when still, returns to water. Their essence is one.\n\nIf one claims the lofty Dao/Way and the moderate path are utterly opposed, this was not the intent of the Sage in composing the *Classic*. It is the fault of unreflective minds.\n\nLaozi, seeing the Dao/Way decline in the Zhou and humanity lose its nature, expounded the *upper* and *lower* teachings, speaking of the *Great Whole* to rescue the world’s later errors. Later scholars, failing to grasp his intent, divided them into *inner* and *outer* doctrines. The distinction between the moderate and the lofty led some to reject one for the other, or to cling to a single perspective. Since the Three Dynasties, scholars have taken many paths, some favoring one extreme, others a single angle. Without comprehensiveness or balance, how can one deeply understand the Dao/Way?\n\nOnly a Sage of perfect wisdom could clarify this.\n\nThe Han dynasty prioritized simplicity, yet its governance was limited; the Jin dynasty indulged in empty discourse, corrupting morals until it collapsed. I say that virtue and the Dao/Way are difficult to know and difficult to practice—for this reason.\n\nSome read Laozi’s words and are bewildered, deeming them not the Sage’s teachings. How could they truly know virtue and the Dao/Way?\n\nYet the *Five Thousand Words* divides its applications into three:\n1. The Dao/Way of *wuwei*,\n2. The Dao/Way of *long life*,\n3. The Dao/Way of *governance*.\n\nSome say the Great Dao/Way is emptiness, yet within emptiness lies the law of governance. Some say governance is the Great Dao/Way, yet governance is merely the residual function of the Dao/Way. As for cultivating the heart and nature, or the methods of *golden elixir* and *returning the elixir*, they cannot be reduced to a single principle.\n\nTo forget speech is to exhaust thought—thus one knows the upper and lower teachings harmonize with all methods. Their flexibility is boundless.\n\n**3. The Revelation of the Doctrine’s Essence and Its Trends**\nThe *Classic* says: *\"Speech has its root.\"* *Zhuangzi* says: *\"It does not depart from its root.\"* This is the *root of Heaven and humanity*.\n\nSequence exists to follow its principle, hence: *\"To speak of the Dao/Way, there must be sequence; to speak of the Dao/Way without its sequence, where then is the Dao/Way?\"*",

It establishes the world through speaking of non-affairs;\n11. It restores the age of decline to ancient splendor;\n12. It does not liken the great to the unworthy, thus all return to it;\n13. It embraces **Oneness** as the **Dao/Way** for governing self and state;\n14. It encompasses all *Classics* through brevity;\n15. It does not speak of nature, yet all principles of nature are revealed;\n16. It encompasses **Dao/Way**, virtue, nature, and life, verifying each in turn.\n\nWith this, one may study the principles and tendencies of all *Classics*—\nhow could they compare to this grand and wondrous application?\nThe divine craft cannot exhaust its wonders.\n\n**VII. Illuminating the **Dao/Way**’s Manifestation and Its Auspicious Periods**\nHeaven’s movements are never constant;\nwhen the time is right, the **Dao/Way** flourishes.\n\nThe Great **Dao/Way** is boundless,\nyet its manifestation among humanity depends on the times.\nFrom the five *kalpas* of obscurity and clarity,\nthe Primordial Sovereign guided the transformations,\nand since the Three Sovereigns descended,\neach dynasty inherited its succession—\nsometimes adopting or discarding teachings according to the age,\nsometimes rising or declining through events.\n\nConsider:\nThe Yellow Emperor received the talismans,\nYu of Xia transmitted the symbols,\nEmperors Yao and Shun bestowed the *Classics*,\nand the Zhou Dynasty displayed its traces.\n\nThe Qin King and Emperor Wu of Han sought the elixir of immortality,\nEmpress Dowager Dou and Emperor Xuan of Han devotedly upheld the teachings of the True Primordial.\nThe Tang honored the Sacred Ancestor,\nand established the principles of the Mysterious Thread.\n\nWhen the Song Emperor Huizong’s profound wisdom shone,\nhis enlightened intelligence radiated,\nand he received the Emperor’s secret words,\ncontinuing the **Dao/Way**’s lineage left unfinished by the Patriarchs.\nHe transmitted the Golden Talismans,\nopened the Celestial Palace,\ncomposed the *Flying Heaven Law Wheel Dao* Canon,\nexpounded the edicts of the **Mixed Primordial Emperor**,\nbroadened the study of the Original Learning,\nand established the Three-Shelter system for scholars and commoners.\nHe honored the Dao Palaces,\ngranted the Master of Teachings the rank of a high official,\nand decreed that celestial talismans, poems, hymns, and diagrams\nwere treasures unseen in ten thousand ages.\n\nAt that time, its grandeur unfolded suddenly,\nand none could fathom its origins.\nSuch extraordinary events\nwere due to the confluence of declining ages,\nthough some may have erred in idle discourse,\nunaware that the *kalpa*’s transmission had its day,\nand the teachings awaited their time.\n\nWhen the Han Dynasty flourished, the Yellow River School expounded the Mysterious,\nand when the Tang Dynasty rose, the Venerable Laozi manifested himself.\nWhen the world nears order, the **Dao/Way** does not act in vain,\nbut rather enhances the brilliance of the scriptures,\nrestoring the sequence of Great Peace.\n\nThe *Sutra on Guiding Beings* states: *\"Four ten-thousand *kalpas* for transmission.\"*\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"A sage appears once in ten thousand ages—\nif one seeks profound understanding,\none must first use the fishing basket and the oxcart.\"*\n\nThose who ride the **Dao/Way** must not forget the Great Teaching.\n\n**VIII. Distinguishing the Universal and the Particular**\nAll *Classics* have universal and particular aspects:\nthe universal refers to the general sequence,\nthe particular to the chapter-by-chapter exposition.\n\nThe universal sequence expounds the grand essence of a *Classic*;\nthe particular sequence unfolds its doctrines chapter by chapter.\nFor instance, the *Sutra on Guiding Beings* has a preface, middle, and postface,\nwith hidden meanings not confined to these three chapters.\n\nNow, when categorizing this *Classic* into universal and particular,\nthe **Dao/Way** and virtue constitute the universal,\nwhile the eighty-one chapters form the particular.\n\n**IX. Responding to Causes and Requests**\nWhen a *Classic* begins without \"You asked, and the Venerable Laozi responded, ‘Where are you?’\"\nit lacks a cause or request.\nExamining the *Classics* and transmissions,\nthe Venerable Laozi taught Yin Xi at the Pass.\nIt is also said that he first taught Emperor Shun.\n\nNow, in *Direct Pointing*, the Venerable Laozi of the Zhou Dynasty taught Yin Xi,\nfor the sake of the fundamental principles of nature and life—\na great and profound matter.\nResponding to Yin Xi,\nwho blocked the Pass and invited the Venerable Laozi to impart profound teachings,\nthis too is a case of responding to a request made clear.\n\nAccording to the *Sutra of Ascending West*,\nYin Xi, as the Pass Keeper, received the Venerable Laozi as a guest,\nand expounded on **Dao/Way** and virtue in two chapters—\nthe details are well-recorded.\n\n**X. Categorizing by Textual Structure**\nA *Classic* is divided into three parts:\nthe preface, the core doctrine, and the concluding transmission.\n\nThis *Classic* lacks opening questions,\nso it is deficient in the preface section;\nit also lacks concluding words of faith, reception, and practice,\nso it is deficient in the concluding transmission section.\n\nNow, we take Ge Xian Gong’s preface as the preface section,\nthe eighty-one chapters as the core doctrine,\nand the propagation of **Dao/Way** and virtue in the world as the concluding transmission.\n\nFurthermore, according to the *Lingbao Scripture*,\nthe introduction states:\n*\"All *Classics* take the ultimate fruit as the preface,\nthe cause as the core,\nand enlightenment as the concluding transmission.\"*\n\nShao Ruoyu said:\nThe **Dao/Way** reveals the real through non-action,\ngranting it special privilege—\nthis is the clarity of non-being.\nVirtue embodies the **Dao/Way** as law and applies it to affairs—\nthis is the realm of action.\nThe two characters, **Dao/Way** and virtue,\nencompass all things without omission.\nThe stages and orders they present\ndepend on the depths of the **Dao/Way** and the divisions of virtue—\nif one does not clarify these stages,\nthere will be mutual confusion and slander.\n\nThe Great **Dao/Way** is tranquil and utterly empty,\nformless and nameless, beyond speech.\nIts scriptures cannot be recorded,\nhence it is called the *Great Ease*.\nThe *Great Ease* refers to the state before *qi* manifests.\nWhen the *Great Ease* moves, the initial *qi* appears,\nhence it is called *Taiqi*.\nThe Venerable Laozi named this strong *qi* as the **Dao/Way**.",

non-being?\nTo clarify non-being through *being*—\nthis is why the **Dao/Way** has depths and shallows.\n\nThe *Great Ease* is the state of utter emptiness (*xūwú*).\nWhen it moves, it becomes the initial stage of *being*,\nhence it is called *Taiqi* (*Great Primordial*).\nWhen *qi* manifests, it marks the beginning of form,\nhence it is called *Taishǐ* (*Great Commencement*).\nWhen *qi* and

      "translated_text": "The Venerable Master Far-Dao often expounds upon the profound and mysterious principles of Dao and Virtue/Power.\n\nThose who revere the Old Master (Laozi) as **Saintly Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness** (*shèngzhì rényì*), or who claim his teachings are practical for governance, merely grasp his outward forms and tools—nothing more.\n\nBut the Old Master, indeed, traces **Dao/Way** to its origin while encompassing the roots of all tools. Thus, the *Five Classics*, the *Three History Texts*, and the *Six Scriptures* (*liùjīng*) all fall under his comprehensive influence.\n\nYet when doubts arise about the Old Master, opinions diverge.\n\nSome say that what the world relies upon for governance—**Benevolence, Righteousness, Ritual, Music, Penal Laws, and Political Order** (*rényì lǐyuè xíngzhèng*)—are like the farmer’s plow or the artisan’s tools: without these implements, there would be no such use. If **Saintly Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness** (*shèngzhì rényì*) could be discarded, then governance would be like hoping for order with bare hands—an impossibility in all ages.\n\nBoth these views are but self-centered perspectives, unable to grasp the fundamental distinction between **Dao/Way** and tools.\n\nIf **Dao/Way** does not depend on tools, then the Old Master’s teachings should be confined solely to **non-action** (*wú*). Yet war and punishment, taxes and wealth, vessels and implements—all these **Dao/Way’s categories and tools** (*dàodào zhī pǐnqì*)—are employed to aid governance. Thus, it is impossible to say that **Dao/Way** ever lacks any of them.\n\nIf it cannot lack them, then **Saintly Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness** (*shèngzhì rényì*) must still exist; how could one claim that **Dao/Way** is utterly impractical?\n\nIf **Dao/Way** transcends form and tools, then it must not await the Old Master’s words to be illuminated. For since the establishment of the **Great Ultimate** (*Tàijí*) and the division of Heaven and Earth, the creation of scriptures and rituals—ever since the opening of the world—none have spoken of **Dao/Way** before the *Book of Changes* (*Yì*). If **Dao/Way** and tools are both contained within the *Yì*, then why should it depend on the later emergence of the Old Master?\n\nThus, those who revere the Old Master while claiming he surpasses the *Five Classics*, the *Three History Texts*, and the *Six Scriptures*, or who doubt him while asserting his teachings are empty and useless, all fail to truly understand the Old Master.\n\nYet the Old Master’s lofty aspirations are indeed present. He delves into the mysteries of **Dao/Way** and speaks of **non-action** (*wú*), exhaustively revealing its subtleties. He employs tools in accordance with **Dao/Way**, yet does not confine himself to mere tools. All that the *Six Scriptures*, the *Analects* (*Lún*), and the *Mencius* (*Mèng*) emphasize—recording events without probing their deeper principles—this book fully elucidates.\n\nTherefore, his work may be placed alongside the *Six Scriptures* as equally authoritative.\n\nSome say that sages and worthies discuss **Dao/Way’s origin** to clarify the world. If so, then their words must still harbor unexpressed intentions.\n\nThere are two possible explanations. Either their hearers were unworthy of deeper discourse, and thus they spoke only superficially, or their own thoughts were incomplete, and they could only hint at the beginning.\n\nConsider the convergence of human mind and **Dao/Way’s mind** (*dàoxīn*). Though they share common ground, the principle of **single-minded focus** (*jīngyī*) could only be imparted by Yao and received by Shun. Who else could participate?\n\nThe **Dao/Way of unity** (*yīguàn*) was only fully expressed by Zengzi’s \"One Thread\" (*yīwéi*), yet not by Zigong. The **four seasons’ operations** and the **birth of myriad things**—though Zigong heard them, he could not replicate their fullness.\n\nAs for **human nature** and the **Dao/Way of Heaven** (*tiāndào*), they are concealed within the written texts. Even Zigong in his early years could not fully grasp them.\n\nAll such matters are unexplored depths in the *Six Scriptures*, the *Analects*, and the *Mencius*.\n\nBut the Old Master records his transcendent insights, hoping that in ten thousand generations, a **Great Sage** (*dàshèng*) will arise to encounter them. His expectations are distant, so he does not wait for one who can personally receive his words before imparting them.\n\nThus, the origins of Heaven and Earth, the beginnings of creation and transformation, the foundations of **Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**—all are exhaustively traced and fully expressed. He establishes categories and ranks, arranging them in order, so that the Confucian scholar who seeks profundity and detail has no closer source.\n\nExamining their practical applications, how could they possibly conflict with Confucian principles? They are, in truth, the **greatest aid to Confucian order** (*rúlùn*).\n\nIf one could calmly observe, discern his refinements, and grasp his core intent, then the three sages’ teachings would be easily comprehended. Their essence is already unfolded in plain speech, from the *Book of Poetry* (*Shī*) and the *Book of Documents* (*Shū*) onward. Their breadth and depth should only be further summarized here.\n\n**Being and Non-being** (*yǒuwú*)\n\nWhen speaking of **being and non-being** in terms of form, all that existed before Heaven and Earth could be named as **non-being** (*wú*). Once Heaven and Earth were formed, and without relying on **human beings, things, or affairs** as tools, then all that should be named as **being** (*yǒu*).\n\nThis is naming **being and non-being** according to their forms.\n\nCommon folk, hearing that the Old Master values **non-being**, doubt that he merely dismisses all forms and physical bodies as irrelevant—thus deeming his teachings impractical.\n\nYet how could they know that the Old Master’s **being and non-being** (*yǒuwú*) refers to the mutual interplay of **Dao/Way** and tools, which cannot be broadly sought through mere forms?\n\nMoreover, **the Undifferentiated** (*Hùnchéng*) is **the Mysterious** (*Xuán*), and **the Mysterious** is **the Mysterious again** (*yòu xuán*). His inquiry reaches the **invisible and inaudible** (*bùkějiànwén*), and if one seizes it, it is **non-being**—the ultimate.\n\nYet Heaven, though square and round, arises from this **non-being**—how could this singular **non-being** not encompass all **being**?\n\nWhen it manifests as **being**, the products of Heaven and Earth are **human beings and things**, and all **human beings and things** contain **original qi** (*yuángas*).\n\nThe **Dao/Way’s branches** are **Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, and Ritual** (*dé rényì lǐ*), and all **Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, and Ritual** encompass the **Great Dao/Way**.\n\nThus, all that is called **myriad beings** is but the divided manifestation of the **Undifferentiated**’s **non-being**.\n\nUpon careful reflection, one will then see the **beginning and end** of **being and non-being**.\n\nTherefore, when the *Book of Changes* first speaks of the **Great Dao/Way**, it also considers that the world’s people may not know how **Dao/Way** and tools mutually depend.\n\nThus, it unites **Dao/Way** and tools as a **single origin** (*yīchū*), and names their manifestations according to what is seen. Hence, what is seen above is called **Dao/Way**, and what is seen below is called **tools**.",

      "translated_text": "The **upper and lower** spoken of here are like saying that within a single entity there exists that which ascends above and that which descends below—yet it cannot be divided into two distinct forms as **ascending** and **descending**.\n\nFire within the wood, when it ascends and becomes empty, is called **flame**; when it settles and becomes solid, it is called **charcoal**. **Flame** and **charcoal** arise solely from the division of ascending and descending within a single fire. If one claims that the ascending flame is fire, yet the settled charcoal is not fire, then all will recognize the error in this.\n\nThis analogy is the most immediate and evident illustration of **Dao/Way** and **tools**’s **upper and lower** distinction.\n\nLaozi, following the *Book of Changes* in speaking of **Dao/Way**, altered its terminology, thus transforming **Dao/Way** and **tools** into **being** and **non-being**, and **upper** and **lower** into **wondrous subtlety**. This was merely to establish his own authority and demonstrate that he had no master to follow.\n\nYet in essence, there is no difference between them.\n\nWhen he speaks of **wondrous subtlety**, he combines the notions of **upper** and **lower** and uses the exterior and interior of a single entity to elucidate the distinction between **tools** and **Dao/Way**.\n\nAll things that possess form and substance, and all matters that exhibit traces and characteristics—whether as vast as Mount Tai or as minute as an autumn hair, whether as expansive as the heavens or as confined as a broom’s sweep—must have their **upper** and **lower**, their **exterior** and **interior**. Thus, **Dao/Way** and **tools** are never truly separate.\n\nYet Laozi’s reverence for **non-being** lies in its being the **source** and all-encompassing, not in his delight for its emptiness. His contempt for **being**, too, stems from its **entangling presence** when confined in form.\n\nHe does not say that once **being** is engaged, it can no longer be **Dao/Way’s use**.\n\n**Non-being within being**—when form divides **being** and **non-being**, then all that belongs to **Dao/Way** is **non-being**, and all that belongs to **tools** is **being**. Their distinction is easily discerned.\n\nBut when **Dao/Way** becomes **tools**, then it has form and substance. With form and substance complete, **true non-being** can no longer be seen.\n\nNow, if we say that Laozi could **master non-being** while **employing being**, then where within its form does he take **non-being**? It is said that **non-being** is inherently carried within **being**. Yet this **non-being** is the most difficult to articulate.\n\nObserve that within all affairs and things, the **empty** and **real** are always in opposition. Thus, those who can comprehend this will understand:\n\nThe **real** is its form and substance; the **empty** is that which does not cling to form and substance yet governs the **real** within it.\n\nTherefore, the **emptiness** within the **real** is the **non-being** within **being**. Laozi indeed clarified this principle to teach others.\n\nHis key words state:\n*\"Thirty spokes converge at one hub, yet it is the hub’s emptiness that makes the wheel’s use possible.\nThus, being is for advantage, non-being is for use.\"*\n\nThe reason the wheel can move is that its spokes and hub are complete—so the spokes and hub are the **real** and **being** within the wheel. But when it comes to **rolling over earth** and **moving forward**, this occurs beyond the wheel’s form and substance, where its function does not belong to **being** but instead to **non-being**.\n\nThis principle—**being** carrying **non-being**, and **non-being** enabling **use**—is the most verifiable of truths.\n\nThus, Laozi applied this principle to human affairs and used it to illuminate his teachings. When he says *\"being is for advantage\"*, he means **cultivating** and **fulfilling** it to ensure its completeness. When he says *\"non-being is for use\"*, he means **abating** and **reducing** it to achieve its function.\n\nIf its completeness is achieved yet there is nothing to **employ** it, then the wheel cannot move on its own. So the spokes and hub are what the wheel **possesses** as **being**, yet the wheel’s **movement** is not what it inherently contains.\n\nWhat it does not inherently contain should rightly be called **non-being**. This is Laozi’s principle of **transcending being** to **employ non-being**.\n\nHence, even when **Dao/Way** manifests in **tools**, such as **weapons** or **punishments**, which grow ever more **concrete** and **real**, he does not deem them worthy of explanation.\n\nTherefore, **tranquility and humility, compassion and simplicity** are the principles governing **weapons**; **relief and dependence on the people’s livelihood**, waiting for them to **value themselves** and **fear death**, then **punishing** the unworthy to serve as a warning, are the principles governing **punishments**.\n\n**Tranquility and humility, compassion and simplicity**—are these not the very opposites of **swords and axes, slaughter and butchery**? Yet those who **dwell without constraint** and **live without satisfaction** are not the instruments of **swords and axes** that ever sought them.\n\nLaozi takes these two meanings to **transcend** the realm of **weapons** and **punishments**, thereby making his principle of **mastering non-being** while **employing being** clearly evident.\n\nIn its ultimate refinement, this principle **goes beyond** speaking of **weapons** as **weapons** or **punishments** as **punishments**, causing **weapons** and **punishments** to **serve his purpose** while he remains **unbound** by them. Only then does he attain the **non-being** he holds in esteem—not the **non-being** that the world misinterprets as **uselessness**.\n\n**Non-being within being**—this principle is not unique to Laozi; Confucius and Mencius also spoke of it.\n\nThey said:\n*\"To hear a lawsuit and still render judgment—this is what I am. My ideal is to make lawsuits nonexistent.\"*\n*\"The virtuous have no enemies.\"*\n\nWhen two parties **contend in litigation**, only then does a **lawsuit** arise; when two armies **clash in battle**, only then does an **enemy** appear. **Lawsuits** and **enemies** give rise to **weapons** and **punishments**.\n\nYet if one seeks to **eliminate their source**, it must be through **emptiness** and **non-being**. Thus, the world’s praise—*\"a single word can settle a dispute\"*—and the **strategic maxims** of *\"ensure victory in battle\"* or *\"exhaust all possibilities\"*—these are not what adheres to **Dao/Way**.\n\nWhy? Because they **cannot transcend** the **exterior** and are **confined** within the **interior**.\n\nTo **roll a brick**, one’s body must be **outside the brick**; yet **pushing or pulling a boat**, the **operations** and **controls** applied are all **not within the boat’s bow or stern**. Thus, **effort is minimal** yet **results are maximal**.\n\nThis is also Laozi’s meaning of **leveraging being** in the **spokes and hub**, yet **abating and reducing** it to **non-being** for true **use**.",
      "overlap_context": "*.\n\nUpon careful reflection, one will then see the **beginning and end** of **being and non-being**.\n\nTherefore, when the *Book of Changes* first speaks of the **Great Dao/Way**, it also considers that the world’s people may not know how **Dao/Way** and tools mutually depend.\n\nThus, it unites **Dao/Way** and tools as a **single origin** (*yīchū*), and names their manifestations according to what is seen. Hence, what is seen above is called **Dao/Way**, and what is seen below is called **tools**.",

      "translated_text": "Although this is merely Confucius and Laozi speaking of **military and penal law** while harmonizing their principles of **being** and **non-being**, their reasoning is already quite clear.\n\nWhen they speak of **artifacts and things**, they **leverage non-being within being**, and their logic is even more evident.\n\nConfucius spoke of **rites and music**, saying:\n*\"Rites, rites!\"—do they refer to jade and silk?*\n*\"Music, music!\"—do they refer to bells and drums?*\nHe emphatically declared that **artifacts alone cannot fully embody rites and music**.\n\nThe **reverence** inherent in rites is not jade or silk—yet without this reverence, jade and silk cannot fulfill their role as rites.\nThe **harmony** inherent in music is not bells or drums—yet without this harmony, bells and drums cannot fulfill their role as music.\n\nThus, both demonstrate the principle of **\"substantially relying on emptiness.\"**\n\nComparing this to Laozi’s words, bells and drums, jade and silk are like the **spokes and hub of a chariot**—rites and music **depend on artifacts to manifest**. Yet artifacts alone cannot fully constitute rites and music, just as **transcending the spokes and hub** is what enables the chariot’s function in **transportation**. Both follow the same principle.\n\nMoreover, when Laozi expounded the subtleties of **non-action**, applying them to governance, he even claimed that **primitive knotted cords** could suffice.\n\nThus, it was fitting that he inverted and transformed rites and laws, establishing an alternative approach.\n\nYet upon closer examination, all the **boats, chariots, weapons, and armor**—these are the very implements of the **Five Emperors and Three Kings**. Yet he dared to claim superiority over the **Six Classics**, saying:\n*\"My Dao transcends mere forms and artifacts. I will correct superficiality with simplicity, govern the world with non-interference, and await the people’s natural contentment—when they value life and do not flee far. Then, even these material tools, though useful, can be set aside.\"*\n\nWhen comparing the principle of **\"using non-being\"**, it aligns entirely with Confucian thought. It is only their methods of teaching that differ, leading to divergent phrasing.\n\nIf Laozi had initially followed the **original language of the *Great Dao/Way and Its Manifestations*** and retained its traditional terminology, simply stating:\n*\"I honor the Dao and humble artifacts. I wield the Dao to command things,\"*\nthen no one would have doubted him.\n\nBut because he transformed **Dao and artifacts into being and non-being**, people failed to recognize that **non-being inherently encompasses being**. Thus, his exaltation of **non-being** risked appearing as idle expectation, hoping for results without action—how could they not doubt?\n\n**Great Master Zhang** has already clarified this principle, yet some listeners still disagree. When reading Laozi, if one replaces **\"non-being\" with \"Dao\"** and **\"Dao\" with \"non-being\"**, the value of non-being becomes clear, and all doubts dissolve.\n\n**Laozi’s use of non-being in three distinct ways** all revolve around **\"gathering emptiness to transform reality.\"**\n\nTo **dull sharpness and resolve disputes**, to **harmonize brilliance with the mundane**, to **purify and perceive the profound**, and to **minimize private desires**—these seek to **remove what harms emptiness**.\n\nTo **drain excess without depletion**, to **conceal the numinous without revealing it**, to **abandon completion without claiming it**—these seek to **embody this emptiness**.\n\nWhen it comes to **grasping the reins of emptiness and reality** to regulate the principles of being and non-being, the application of **hardness and softness** is most comprehensive and clearly articulated.\n\nFor **hardness as Dao**, if one seeks to **achieve directly without detours**, its form becomes **solid and blocked**.\nFor **softness as Dao**, it **responds to prompts**, follows without contention—yet within, **real actions and decisions are made**, while **rigidity remains unseen**. Thus, its form is **open and fluid**.\n\nHence, the **open can govern the blocked**, and **softness often overcomes hardness**.\n\nIn all cases—whether **knowing when to be fierce yet yielding**, or **taking the lead by stepping back**—these are all **rejecting hardness’s blockage** and **embodying softness to act through emptiness**.\n\nThis is also how one **reverses things** to ultimately achieve **great harmony**.\n\nWhen the **open and empty** take action, they move **without trace**, accomplish **without effort**—such is their effect.\n\nWhen **wielding reality while mastering emptiness**, no one can perceive it.\nOnly when its effects manifest in emptiness do people **suddenly marvel at its mystery**—this is the *Great Dao/Way and Its Manifestations*’ principle of **\"not hastening yet arriving swiftly, not moving yet reaching far.\"**\n\nThus, he summarizes his overarching principle:\n*\"Softness is the Dao’s application.\"*\nThen, when explaining how softness is applied, he adds:\n*\"All things under heaven arise from being; being arises from non-being.\"*\n\n**Success and failure through non-being**\nThe principle of valuing non-being has long been a treasure used by ancients and moderns alike. Yet some succeed with it, while others fail.\n\n**King Wen of Zhou** abandoned **Fengxi**, and **Xu Youwang** refused to drive his people into war—these are of one kind.\n**Emperor Yuan of Han** was indecisive, and **Emperor Wen** was silent—also of one kind.\nYet their outcomes were vastly different, so later generations, judging by appearances, criticized their failures, saying:\n*\"Knots and cords could not save the chaos of Qin, nor could the *wu gan* dance resolve the crisis at Pingcheng.\"*\nThey thus dismissed Laozi’s words as useless, unaware that the fault lay in their **misapplication**, so how could they be said to understand?\n\n**Liezi** constructed the analogy of the **Xiang and Guo clans** to illustrate wealth, clarifying that **similar intentions led to opposite outcomes**—saying:\n*\"Xiang understood Guo’s words on wealth but not the Dao of wealth, thus it backfired upon himself.\"*\nHis intent was precisely to draw this parallel.\n\nThe **Eighty-first Chapter** indeed takes **softness as its foundation**, yet its methods of applying it—**restraining the lenient with strictness, tempering the lax with vigor, acting secretly**—are such that when **misguided people abandon the proper path for the strange**, it is because **rigid integrity and brilliance have already emerged to govern**.\n\nCould it be that there is **only softness and no hardness**?",

      "translated_text": "The people all rely on life while fearing death, yet some still dare to act strangely—if they are seized and killed, then the authority’s power over love is utterly without flaw. Again, if one boasts of their tools’ sharpness and claims victory is certain, then one should merely suppress their strength, weaken their vigor, and cover it with softness. This is not an exclusive adherence to softness.\n\nThus, all who in this world admire emptiness and simplicity while neglecting practical affairs are those who cling to the receptive yet never grasp the creative. Those who lack the virtue of the ancient sages and seek to engage in mere ritualistic affairs will inevitably meet with ruin.\n\nWhen the *Dao* is compared to the *Yijing*’s division of existence and nonexistence, it is merely a distinction between *Dao* and its manifestations. Yet in *Laozi*, the gradations of existence and nonexistence are far more intricate. From nonexistence upward, there is the *Xuan* (玄) and then the *Youxuan* (又玄), which becomes the gateway to all marvels. The perpetually nonexistent is merely what one may follow to observe these marvels. But to encompass all marvels and manifest them, one must belong to the *Youxuan*.\n\nFrom *Xuan* to *Youxuan* is to ascend to the *Dao* as naturalness itself. Naturalness—what is done without doing, what in the world acts spontaneously, transforms itself, rectifies itself, and enriches itself without knowing the power of the Sovereign—this is its effect. Therefore, *Laozi* dares to belittle the wisdom of sages, for he grounds himself in this foundation to elevate his loftiness. Since the *Dao* becomes virtue, and virtue endures by not being possessed, the three names—*One* (一), *Symbol* (象), and *Uncarved Block* (朴)—are its summation.\n\nFrom this arises heaven and earth, and creation manifests as benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness—all are virtue. Yet within the Five Constants, each virtue further divides into higher and lower. When the highest virtue reaches its peak, there is still a deeper virtue beyond it, crowned with *Xuan* as *Xuan Virtue* (玄德). The *receptive female* (牝) and the *receptive unity* (同), the *receptive vision* (览)—these are of the same kind, though their names reside in virtue, their essence has already entered the *Dao*.\n\nSuch is the detail, hence those who speak of the Six Classics and *Lunyu-Mengzi* draw from it, truly not in vain. Let us take the discussion of *ren* (仁) between Confucius and Mencius as an example and compare it with *Laozi*’s words, then one will know that though Confucian speech has distinctions, its established gradations do not match the precision of *Laozi*’s insights.\n\nFor instance, a child’s love for their parents and rescuing a child from a well are both called *ren*. Yet the *Nine Alliances and One Rectification* is said to be the opposite of truly attaining the name of *ren*. This distinction, though acknowledged by Confucius and Mencius, was never fully elaborated in their gradations. As for broadly benefiting and aiding the people, extending it to the sage, even Zigong doubted whether it fully exhausted *ren*’s principles—because the gradations were insufficiently refined, and the standard could not be firmly established.\n\nThus, the Six Classics and Confucius-Mencius must rely on *Laozi*, for all such cases are of this nature. This is not to oppose *Laozi* while suppressing Confucianism; *Laozi*’s focus on nonexistence allows him to elaborate further on the *Dao*’s gradations. If one reverses the perspective, then Confucian speech, detailed in worldly affairs, appears overly sparse and vague in *Laozi*’s eyes. Since their fundamental orientations differ, their discussions naturally vary in depth—this is inevitable, not a matter of superiority or inferiority.\n\nAs for *Laozi*’s nonexistence, its need for the Six Classics’ existence is something everyone recognizes, requiring no further debate.\n\n**On the Sequence of the *Dao*:**\nTo ascend from learning to enlightenment, one must first follow the path and only then enter the chamber. There is a beginning and an end, firmly establishing its ordered sequence. The world holds *Laozi* in too high regard, saying that he does not discuss the *Dao*’s manifestations. Thus, whenever his teachings touch on practical cultivation, they always lead to self-reduction and nonexistence. Hence, his writings, though seemingly superficial, are in fact the outer and inner layers of nonexistence—yet they cannot encompass the nonexistence that contains existence.\n\nBoth Confucian and Daoist discussions of the *Dao* treat its manifestation as the key to sagehood. Yet when examining how transformation is achieved, they all rely on reducing existence to enable the transformation of existence into nonexistence. From this principle, one can discern the *Dao*.\n\nReduction begins with cultivation—like fermenting millet and adding mold to make wine. Once completed, the millet and mold transform into sweetness. This is indeed the symbol of transforming existence into nonexistence. Yet has there ever been, from ancient times to now, one who could alter water alone without millet and mold?\n\nIf one seeks refined wine from mere water without first fermenting millet and adding mold, it is like demanding the five flavors from an empty vessel—this is to leap from the stage of cultivation to the beginning of reduction, claiming to achieve transformation without the necessary preparation. If cultivation is not yet complete, what foundation will receive this reduction?\n\nSuch cases vary with depth and shallowness. The world will surely criticize them as superficial. Yet those who dare to trust themselves will harmonize the Six Classics with Confucius and *Laozi*, finding no discrepancy. Even if *Laozi* were to rise again, this statement would remain unchanged.\n\n**On Heaven and Humanity:**\nFrom ancient times...",

      "translated_text": "「Existence and nonexistence are but two brushstrokes. The Great Dao in which one abides is boundless and obscure, profound and silent—this is the state of nonexistence. From nonexistence to existence, from existence to transformation, returning again to nonexistence, then its existence and nonexistence are as one. The Dao of cultivation and reduction is likewise: beginning with existence and ending with nonexistence, then existence and nonexistence are again as one.\n\nThe earlier discourse on existence and nonexistence relies upon the interplay of yin and yang in life and death. Once things are formed, they revert to their root—this is the Dao of Heaven’s existence and nonexistence. When virtue is manifested through benevolence, righteousness, and propriety, and its deepest essence aligns with the Dao, then this is the Dao of Humanity’s existence and nonexistence. Though both arise from the same origin, their expressions differ vastly, so they cannot be conflated. Hence, *Laozi*’s words sometimes fail to distinguish between Heaven and Humanity, conflating their existence and nonexistence, for he knew their root was one and did not need to separate them as distinct.\n\n**On *Laozi*’s Rejection of Sage-Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness:**\nThose who deeply understand *Laozi*’s outright abandonment of sage-wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness say: This is but a rhetorical exaggeration, not his true intent. Yet the world, past and present, mostly blames him for his words clashing with the Classics. Yet if one listens to his teachings and examines his deeds, the true principles become evident, and he cannot be falsely accused.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s thirteen hexagrams that emphasize symbols and instruments—including the saying, *\"垂衣裳而天下治\"* (governing by hanging one’s robes and the world is in order)—draw upon the principles of *乾* (Heaven) and *坤* (Earth). This was the very method by which the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun successively innovated and upheld governance. Thus, sage-wisdom was indeed the domain of the Yellow Emperor as well.\n\n*Laozi* invoked the Yellow Emperor to found his teaching, yet condemned all ancient sage-wisdom as false, implying even the Yellow Emperor was among those rejected. How could one person, whose Way could be emulated yet whose methods were utterly discarded? Judging by *Laozi*’s own deeds, his words were but ornamentation, not substance—this is clear.\n\n**On Zhuangzi’s Expansion of *Laozi*’s Teachings:**\nZhuangzi further magnified and broadened his master’s doctrine, declaring that *\"剖斗折衡而民不争\"* (splitting the measuring cup and breaking the scales would make the people cease contention). This statement especially compounds the criticism leveled against *Laozi*’s teachings. Yet within it lies truth, and one can use his own words to illuminate their rhetorical nature.\n\nBoth *Laozi* and Zhuangzi championed the practice of knotting cords (*结绳*) as a method they claimed had been effective in antiquity. Yet knotting cords—what is its origin? Was it not a means for people to trust one another in a time when written records did not yet exist? If their purity and simplicity were intact and no deceit remained, why would they need knotted cords at all? Extending this logic, it seems they were merely aspiring to create written contracts (*书契*) but had not yet reached that stage.\n\nIn the age of unadulterated antiquity, when laws were not yet needed, they still relied upon knotted cords for trust. Yet to say that human deceit had reached its extreme and that laws could not restrain it, while hoping to eliminate all such tools and thus extinguish contention—this is impossible unless *Laozi* himself ruled as sovereign and his disciple, Yin Geng, was appointed alongside Zhuangzi to govern the people. Otherwise, contention would persist.\n\nThus, Zhuangzi lamented his own rhetorical excesses, and at the end of his work, he clarified: *\"周之辞荒唐而说谬悠\"* (The language of Zhou is extravagant and its explanations fanciful). His claim to not betray the Dao rests upon his ability to return to the fundamental principles and harmonize them with the highest truths, reaching only then what may be called sincere discourse.\n\nThose who point to *Laozi*’s teachings as mere nihilism follow only his initial extravagant and fanciful words, unaware of the deeper truths revealed after his harmonization with the highest principles. Confucius and Mencius, whose lives overlapped with *Laozi* and Zhuangzi’s, spoke without restraint. If Confucius or Mencius had encountered such doctrines, they would have systematically refuted them, yet they never did. This is because their differences did not harm their underlying unity.\n\nThe scattered principles of the *Yijing* found in its sixty-four hexagrams were later consolidated in the *Xīcí* (Appendices). Examining *Laozi*’s entire work, his reasoning never strays beyond what is found in the *Xīcí*, nor does he establish any separate doctrine. Judging by his intent, it appears he drew his roots from the *Yijing* and gathered its branches from the upper and lower *Xīcí* (Appendices).\n\nConfucius and Zhuangzi both revered their teachers, yet it is said that *\"孔氏尝即老氏而北面焉\"* (Confucius once stood facing *Laozi* in respect). This claim seems to be an attempt to deflect criticism by exaggerating his own veneration, masking the truth with grandiosity. Later, in the Tang Dynasty, Han Yu took offense at these words and addressed them in his *\"原道\"* (Discourse on the Way), blaming the Confucian scholars for failing to refute them. This was indeed a defense of orthodoxy.\n\nYet my view differs. If there is alignment with the Dao, the Dao cannot be divided—how could one not inherit it? If there is no objection to inheriting, then why should one reject the other? Thus, whether Confucius took *Laozi* as teacher or not is irrelevant.\n\nConfucius once said:\n*\"晋之乘，楚之梼杌，鲁之春秋，其义一也。其事则齐威、晋文，其文则史，其义则丘窃取之矣。\"*\n(The chariot records of Jin, the bamboo annals of Chu, and the Spring and Autumn Annals of Lu all share the same principles. Their events concern figures like Qi Wei and Jin Wen, their texts are historical records, and their meaning is what I have appropriated.)\n\nAgain he said:\n*\"三人行，必有我师焉，择其善者而从之。\"*\n(When three people walk together, there is always one who may be my teacher. I select their good qualities and follow them.)\n\nIf Confucius had truly taken *Laozi* as his teacher, then even upon hearing their words directly, he would have no bias. If *Laozi* were to adopt Confucius’ methods and use them to uphold his own Way, why would his followers’ excessive partiality and overzealous veneration harm their belonging to my school?」",

      "translated_text": "Thus, whether one takes Laozi as a teacher or not, his words may be entrusted to ambiguity, yet there are some that cannot but be discerned. Confucius is revered by all ages as the origin of virtue and power, because he gathered the wisdom of the sages and achieved greatness, yet even when his heart wandered, he never transgressed the bounds.\n\nNow, if Laozi were to fabricate words to portray Confucius, and claim that he was arrogant and boastful, while his teachings were not fully exhausted, this would imply that at times Confucius might indeed have surpassed the bounds, yet how could he be worthy of instructing the limitless future generations? This is a harm to Confucius’ deeds and a hindrance to his essence.\n\nFor this reason, the Great Chang thoroughly examined Laozi’s words and exhausted their long-standing interpretations. After careful study, he realized that the two books generally spoke of the Dao and its sequence, often borrowing the language of Confucius and Yan Hui to illustrate shallow analogies. Thus, the reverence of the three sages for Confucius is already profound.\n\nYet their exaggerated claims are not entirely accurate. When Mozi spoke of Yan Hui’s \"seated-forgetting\" (坐忘), comparing it to Confucius, he placed it within the realm of \"ear-obedience\" (耳顺), but in Laozi’s teaching, it becomes a means of self-benefit and self-diminishment.\n\nZhuangzi, in his portrayal of Confucius and Yan Hui conversing, said: \"Yan Hui, I exchanged one arm with you and lost it.\" This implies that Yan Hui could diminish himself but not fully attain the state of non-action (無). Again, he once described Yan Hui’s self-expression as: \"The Master does not speak, yet the people follow; he lacks implements, yet the people pour forth before him.\" Yan Hui was beyond reach.\n\nThe Master (Confucius) dashed away, leaving dust behind, yet Yan Hui could not catch up. Therefore, to diminish further and attain the state of \"non-action yet nothing is left undone\" (無為無不為), only Confucius could truly meet this standard. Here, their hierarchy is clearly distinguishable.\n\nHow could there be a sage whose virtue is outwardly manifested, who already possesses the power of \"not speaking yet being trusted\" and \"neither benefiting nor diminishing\" yet is accused of boastful arrogance? Thus, the books’ treatment of Confucius—sometimes suppressing and sometimes elevating him—generally employs two contrasting approaches to provoke reflection in those who hear only one perspective.\n\nHence, the two sages (Laozi and Zhuangzi) mutually attack Confucius, yet their words do not contradict the Dao, all falling into this category.\n\nThe *Daodejing* divides its text into two volumes, calling them collectively the *Daodejing*—this tradition comes from Wang Bi. The Great Chang believes that this collective title originated from antiquity. Now, the current editions that separately label them as the *Daojing* and the *Dejing* likely reflect later annotations, for even the upper volume speaks of governance and warfare, while the lower volume discusses the unity of Way and virtue, the interplay of hard and soft, and thus fully reveals that virtue and power cannot be divided.\n\nThe numbering of chapters—eighty-one in total—each marked by the first phrase of the chapter to indicate their order, may also be a later addition. Yet the idea that the five thousand words were originally eighty-one teachings must surely come from Laozi himself.\n\nIn each chapter, there are phrases beginning with \"故\" (*gu*—\"thus\"), \"故\" (*gu*—\"thus\"), and \"是以\" (*shìyǐ*—\"therefore\"), all seeking to connect the upper and lower threads, making the words concise yet the meaning complete.\n\nEach chapter’s language has its own starting point, yet the meaning within a single chapter is also interconnected, clarifying the principles. But those who interpret its meaning take each sentence as a separate doctrine, making this sentence incompatible with others, and each chapter as a distinct teaching, making this chapter irrelevant to others—this is not in line with Laozi’s intent.\n\nAs for the naming of chapters, from Wang Bi onward, all subsequent editions align with the current transmitted text, except for He Shang Gong, who emerged in the early Han dynasty, and whose chapter names differ. If Laozi himself had personally set and named them, there would certainly be no such divergence.\n\nThis pattern is evident.",

Yet, the Master He Shang [河上公] thoroughly examined the *Dao De Jing* [《道德经》] from beginning to end, revealing patterns and precedents that mutually illuminate each other. When the language of one chapter merely introduces its meaning without concluding it, the subsequent chapter must offer another discourse to bring it to completion. Thus, He Shang’s annotations all clarify their convergence, gathering scattered meanings and preserving them in unity, so that one may see how Laozi, though advocating the \"Way of No-thing\" [谈无], yet in its divisions resembles the *Zhou Guan* [《周官》]'s Six Ordinances [六典]—with general and particular distinctions, large and small details, sequentially permeating each other, and every passage capable of thorough examination. How could this be likened to the hollow, non-existent assumptions of the Zongzi [岂同子虚]?\n\nThose who claim Laozi’s words are mere empty vessels, let them ponder this: the **separation and concealment** [离隐].\n\nLaozi, with his elevated worldly insight, could fathom the depths of the Dao [道奥], having indeed exhausted all that exists in his discourse, yet also allowing his meaning to extend beyond mere words. Thus, there emerged the form of **separation and concealment** [离隐].\n\nWhat is meant by **separation** [离]? It is that a single truth is dispersed across multiple chapters, yet no single chapter fully exhausts it.\n\nWhat is meant by **concealment** [隐]? It is that he speaks of what is so without explaining *why* it is so, hoping that those with profound understanding will grasp it themselves. Hence, his words are like the **Lian Mountains and Duanyu Gorges** [连山断壑], disjointed yet interconnected.\n\nInterpreters who fail to grasp this fall into the error of fragmenting chapters and sentences, leaving the Dao’s principles scattered and incomplete.\n\nConfucius said: *\"Lift one corner and the other three corners will not respond, then I will not teach you again.\"* This is precisely the **separation and concealment** [离隐] he spoke of.\n\nThus, He Shang, in his effort to clarify the corners, dared not to be lax, only seeking to avoid mere dissection.\n\nThose who annotate Laozi’s text in later ages often focus on extracting profound and abstruse phrases, deepening obscurity to the point of making his words seem **lean and cryptic** [廋辞隐语]. Again, like later Buddhist masters discussing *Chan* [禅], leaving readers utterly perplexed.\n\nHe Shang could not fully determine their correctness, but he heard an ancient saying that used painting to criticize worldly habits: *\"Painters delight in depicting ghosts and gods, yet hesitate to paint dogs and horses.\"* Since the skill of painting dogs and horses can be measured, yet ghosts and gods are dim and indistinct—this is why He Shang, whenever he encountered such annotations, would clarify their language and verify them with human affairs, illustrating their success or failure. His explanations were indeed appropriate.\n\nBut if one seeks to borrow obscurity for profundity, hiding within what cannot be interrogated, why not simply refrain from speaking at all?\n\n**He Shang’s annotations and Zhuangzi’s text** [列庄]:\nIn antiquity, there were no annotations or commentaries. If one wished to expound upon earlier works, they would compose a separate book to elucidate them. Hence, the *Liezi* [列氏] and *Zhuangzi* [庄氏]—these two books—stand as the very **explanations of meaning** [义疏] for the *Five Thousand Words* [五千言].\n\nLaozi’s language is concise and austere, not expansive, and his **separation and concealment** [离隐] renders it difficult to immediately comprehend. These two masters, however, elaborated and compiled his teachings.\n\nYet, there are those whose elaborations go too far, veering into **fanciful and unfounded claims** [诞].\n\nStill, their gathering of scattered truths and rendering of clear distinctions—whether concerning the Dao or its manifestations—all find proper resolution.\n\nBy comparing these two masters’ interpretations with those of others, one sees that those who delight in depicting ghosts and gods yet fail to truly recognize them are many.\n\n**General preface and postscript** [大旨序跋]:\n\nThe *Yijing* [《易》] speaks of *\"Heaven’s Mysterious\"* [天玄], and again says *\"the divine\"* [神]—that which subtly encompasses all things and gives rise to speech.\n\nThe Mysterious [玄] is Heaven’s true essence, the divine [神] refers to the unfathomable interplay of *yin* and *yang* [阴阳]. Laozi equates subtlety with the Mysterious; the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious is not the source from which all subtleties emerge?\n\nSu Shi [苏子瞻] composed *The Record of the Hall of All Subtleties* [《众妙堂记》], beginning when he observed a man scattering water and trimming grass, whose hands moved like wind and rain, and whose steps followed perfect measure—then sighed at his skill, and later, using the molting of cicadas and the brooding of hens, described the true subtlety of the Dao [道之真妙].\n\nSuch techniques, though refined, are acquired through practice, not innate genius.\n\nConfucius, when the Duke of Zhou [周] visited Lu during the reign of Duke Zhao [鲁昭公], asked: *\"Have you attained the Dao?\"* If the Dao could be offered to others, then all would present it to their rulers; if it could be transmitted to others, then all would pass it to their descendants. Yet this is impossible, for without an inner master, the Dao cannot be obtained.\n\nHe Shang was invited to serve as the *Cang Shi* [藏室史] in Zhou’s archives, and his son, named Zong [宗], held a military position in Wei. Several generations later, his descendant named Yun [云], still bearing the name Jie [解], became the tutor for the Prince of Jiaoxi [胶西王] during the Han dynasty.\n\nLaozi was not without office nor descendants; yet his profound and subtle teachings were neither presented to his ruler nor transmitted to his progeny. Was this not because the Zhou dynasty was in decline, the great Dao about to vanish, and the only one to record it and leave it to the world was the Prefect of Guan [关令]? Those without inner mastery could never truly hear it.\n\nThe Han Emperor Wen [汉文帝] reigned for twenty-three years, personally cultivating profound silence and relying solely on *virtue* [德] to transform the people—this may be said to encompass all subtleties and attain them.\n\nHe Shang displayed his divine transformations: leaping into the air and soaring through emptiness, only to rest in the Mysterious. If this is what he considered the Mysterious, how could it be Laozi’s Mysterious?\n\nNeither the *Records of the Grand Historian* [《史记》] nor the *History of the Han* [《汉书》] record him, and there is good reason for this.\n\nMaster Liu Yuewu [刘月屋], the overseer of the *Xuanmiao Guan* [玄妙观] in Changde [常德路], compiled annotations on the *Dao De Jing*, which Qian Zhi [钱梓] regarded as a beacon for the distant transmission of the teachings. This was indeed a scholar with aspirations toward contemplating the Mysterious.\n\nThus, I recount what I have heard to inform you, so that you may verify it with the renowned sages of the world.\n\nIn the winter of the third year of Yuan Zheng [元贞丙申孟冬], on the day after the full moon, I observed the rituals of the recluse Mr. Ba [居士巴] in the Chuan Yang [辰阳] region, seeking to clarify the Dao’s subtleties and concealments.\n\nIn ancient times, our Laozi transmitted the *Dao De Jing* [《道德经》] to the world, its profound principles deep and obscure, not merely for the sake of teaching and guiding others. Across generations, enlightened rulers and great scholars have all annotated and studied its subtleties, passing it down endlessly from ancient to modern times. Even Daoists today recite its core text, yet still fear they do not fully grasp its intent. Without consulting the annotations of various masters, how could one truly penetrate the depths of its mysteries?",
      "overlap_context": " this sentence incompatible with others, and each chapter as a distinct teaching, making this chapter irrelevant to others—this is not in line with Laozi’s intent.\n\nAs for the naming of chapters, from Wang Bi onward, all subsequent editions align with the current transmitted text, except for He Shang Gong, who emerged in the early Han dynasty, and whose chapter names differ. If Laozi himself had personally set and named them, there would certainly be no such divergence.\n\nThis pattern is evident.",

      "translated_text": "The Great Virtue of the third year, in the cycle of *ji-hai*, on the late evening of the Upper Element Festival, the humble Sima Weiyong penned this postscript in coarse robes.\n\nThe *Laozi* is nothing but an attempt to emulate Heaven. Indeed, Heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows Nature. When it says, *\"All things arise without claiming merit, give birth without possession, act without reliance, and complete their work without taking credit,\"* these four phrases—though differing in degree—are the very voice of the Sage.\n\nFor Heaven does not claim merit in creating all things, yet it gives birth without possession—its generative intent fills Heaven and Earth, yet it never claims the deed as its own. It acts without reliance—its work pervades Heaven and Earth, yet it never boasts of its power. Its deeds are never undone, yet it does not dwell upon completion—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nWhen it says *\"not striving,\"* *\"not seeing what is desirable,\"* it is to keep the heart undisturbed. When it says *\"stillness and tranquility are the rectification of the world,\"* it is nothing but emulating Heaven. Thus, when I do nothing, the people transform themselves; when I love stillness, the people rectify themselves; when I have no affairs, the people grow wealthy; when I have no desires, the people return to simplicity. These are the verifiable effects of *wuwei*.\n\nTo expound the *Laozi*, one must not depart from emulating Heaven, from Nature, from stillness and *wuwei*—otherwise, there is no ground for words. Thus, in my humble attempt to elucidate the *Laozi* through these principles alone, perhaps I have glimpsed its intent.\n\nOne day, the revered Xuanmiao Sima Yuewu showed me his *Laozi* commentary, written at Shitan, and asked me to add annotations. I said: *\"My ancestor, the Preceptor of Ying, has already devoted great effort to this text. The Master of Po has praised it, saying that if such a work had existed in the Warring States, there would have been no Shang Yang or Han Fei; if it had existed in the early Han, Buddhism and Daoism would not have been divided.\"* Even Cheng Taihe admired its excellence. How could I dare to surpass my ancestor’s insights with my own?\n\nYuewu said: *\"The principles of the text are boundless—how could one exhaust its depths without ceaseless exploration, like water flowing endlessly?\"* Unable to refuse, I reluctantly undertook the task. After many days, the work was complete—sufficient in scope, though I could never hope to follow in my ancestor’s footsteps.

Was it not fate that preserved the *Lü Lingguang* alone? Those clad in yellow headgear chanting morning and evening, yet some still stumble over sentence structure—I privately sighed deeply, not shirking presumption, and corrected its errors while elucidating its meaning.\n\nAt the time, I exchanged letters monthly with the Stone Pool Master, who requested this work, so I recorded it and sent it to him. Upon his first reading, he praised it. In the year *Xinmao*, I was honored to present the *Yi* and *Lao* texts as a tribute, earning the title of \"Ancient Scholar.\"\n\nIn the summer of *Bingshen*, Master Chang Wu of the *Zhao* clan, Zhao Guandao, came to rectify the essential principles of learning, showing me the Stone Pool Master’s two works. He instructed me to place my newly published *Dao De Jing* commentary—written in vernacular style—among the other interpretations, and entrusted me with further revisions. I was astonished, then fell ill with shock. Having already set the text to print, I could not retract my labor.\n\nIn the summer of *Jihai*, I braved the heat to visit the Stone Pool Master, but his printing was only two-thirds complete, and the Stone Pool Master himself had already become an ancient. Amid my sorrow, I reflected on the sayings of \"wooden drill piercing stone, grinding bricks into mirrors,\" and composed this in ancient style, urging perseverance to resolve this grand case.\n\nWhat mortals desire, Heaven grants—this text’s survival is Heaven’s will. That all interpretations converge into one to ensure immortality is also Heaven’s will. Can mortals defy Heaven? The foolish thus begin and end by attributing all to Heaven.\n\nBefore departing, the Stone Pool Master requested an epilogue, so I appended these words to the end. This autumn, the seventh month, the former scholar-official, Respectful Clarity, Yue Qingzhong, wrote this.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* encompasses Heaven and Earth in its vastness, yet delves into the minutest details—its language is concise, yet its meaning profound. How could a mere jade box or golden key unlock its depths so hastily?\n\nFrom ancient to modern, commentaries and poetic interpretations abound, each with its merits, yet often omitting what others grasp—like eight musical tones discordant, failing to achieve harmony. The Stone Pool Master, Liu Weiyong, compiled the five thousand words into thirty-one volumes, gathering seventy-eight commentaries—whether from Daoists, Confucians, Buddhists, recluses, or the obscure—even the most ethereal phrases of the *Luanbi* style were not discarded. In a single glance, one enters a treasure house: gold, pearls, coral, ivory, rhinoceros horn, mercury, cinnabar, green herbs—jade slips scattered in myriad forms. Was this not the culmination of all interpretations?\n\nAlas, this text was not composed by Master Guanyin in a single revelation—his contribution was immense, yet Master Liu’s achievement is no lesser. Though the Supreme Venerable upholds *wuwei* as his principle, those who recite this text, through seventy-eight schools and countless words, arrive at the five thousand words, then at one word, then at no-word—like the Dragon and the Old Man of the South, they ascend effortlessly to the void, exclaiming, *\"The child is teachable.\"*\n\nGreat Virtue, *Gengzi* month, the eighth day after the full moon, the Heavenly Master’s successor, the Great Substance, Broad Dao, True Person Zhang Yucai, wrote this epilogue.\n\n*The Dao De Jing*’s grand essence and comprehensive meaning conclude here.",
