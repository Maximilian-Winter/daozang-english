  "full_translation": "**The Scripture of Internal Elixir Returning to the Origin**\n\n**Title:** *Scripture of Internal Elixir Returning to the Origin*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern Song dynasty. One fascicle. Based on the text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Tai Xuan Section.\n\n---\n\n**The Scripture of Internal Elixir Returning to the Origin**\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao must first understand the Five Phases, then comprehend the Four Symbols. They must discern the art of inverting yin and yang and recognize the method of employing the Seven Treasures. The Nine Perfected Immortals □□ rely upon the viscera and bowels, and the Eight Trigrams correspond internally—one must know the causes of their origins. Within these subtle intricacies, each detail is expounded; lead, mercury, and the yellow sprout are arranged in the following chapters.\n\nThe Five Phases are the liver, lungs, heart, kidneys, and spleen.\nThe liver corresponds to the east, the Jia-Yi Wood. The liver is the organ of Wood, and within it resides □, called the Azure Dragon. Its □ ascends along the left meridian of the Governing Vessel beside the spine, flowing into the eyes to become tears. These tears are called True Water, the liver’s surplus □, which flows into the left side of the upper palate, where it is named the Golden Liquor.\n\nThe lungs correspond to the west, the Geng-Xin Metal. The lungs are the organ of Metal, and within them resides □, called the White Tiger. Its □ ascends along the right meridian of the Governing Vessel beside the spine, flowing into the nose to become mucus. This mucus is called True Gold. The lungs’ surplus □ flows into the right side of the upper palate, where it is named the Returned Elixir.\nAs the *Explanations of Internal Elixir Scripture* states: “Above, there is the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir.”\n\nThe heart corresponds to the south, the Bing-Ding Fire. The heart is the organ of Fire, and within it resides □, called the Vermilion Bird. Its □ pertains to the Three Front Paths of the Precious Stairway, ascending along the central meridian to enter beneath the tongue, transforming into saliva. When swallowed, it enters the heart and transforms into a cavity, also called True Fire. The surplus blood □ flows into the right side of the upper palate, where it is named Spirit Water.\n\nThe kidneys correspond to the north, the Ren-Gui Water. The kidneys are the organ of Water, and within them resides □, called the Dark Warrior. Its □ ascends along the right meridian of the abdomen, enters the ears, circles the Celestial Realm, then descends into the kidneys. The kidneys’ surplus □ flows into the right side beneath the tongue, where it is named the Flowery Pond.\nAs the *Explanations of Internal Elixir Scripture* states: “Within, there is the Spirit Water Flowery Pond.”\n\nThe spleen corresponds to the center, the Wu-Ji Earth. The spleen is the organ of Earth, and within it resides □, called the Victorious Serpent. Its □ ascends along the Governing Vessel beside the spine, enters the lungs, and transforms into saliva, called True Earth. The surplus saliva □ flows into the lips, where it is named the Yellow Sprout.\n\nThe Four Symbols are: first, the Metal Elder; second, the □ Maiden; third, the Infant Boy; and fourth, the Yellow Matriarch.\nThe Metal Elder is the saliva within the lungs.\nQuestion: Saliva belongs to yin, so why is it called the Metal Elder?\nAnswer: Because above it are the Returned Elixir, Golden Liquor, Spirit Water, Flowery Pond, and Yellow Sprout, which harmonize to form yang. With yang above and yin below, it is thus named the Metal Elder. Just as in the heavens there is the sun, which is pure yang, and within the sun is the crow with three legs, corresponding to the west’s Geng-Xin Metal—internally yin and externally yang—hence the name Metal Elder.\n\nThe □ Maiden is the cavity within the heart.\nQuestion: The cavity belongs to the south’s Bing-Ding Fire, and fire is yang within yang. The cavity is also yang, so why is it called the □ Maiden?\nAnswer: Because the saliva above belongs to yin, and the blood below belongs to yang, forming yang within yin, it is thus named the □ Maiden. Just as in the heavens there is the moon, which is pure yin, and within the moon is the hare, corresponding to the east’s Jia-Yi Wood—with yang above and yin below—hence the name □ Maiden.\n\nThe Infant Boy is the essence within the kidneys.\nQuestion: The essence within the kidneys is pure yin, yet it is called the Infant Boy. Similarly, the male body is pure yang, but within it, essence belongs to yin, forming yin within yang. Thus, it is named the Infant Boy, hence the saying: “Kan (☵) is the boy, Li (☲) is the maiden.”\n\nThe Yellow Matriarch is the saliva within the spleen, which is called True Earth.\nQuestion: The spleen and Earth belong to yin, and saliva also belongs to yin. Why is there no yin-yang pairing?\nAnswer: The spleen is upper yin, and saliva is lower yin, forming solitary yin—hence the name Yellow Matriarch.\n\nThe Seven Internal Treasures are: fluid, water, saliva, blood, spirit □, essence, and the Nine Perfected Immortals’ □. Within the human body, what enters through the nose □ belongs to the liver, what exits □ belongs to the lungs; what is blown from the mouth □ belongs to the kidneys, what is exhaled (he) □ belongs to the heart, what is sighed (xi) □ belongs to the spleen; the household master’s □ used belongs to the small intestine; □ when one first becomes angry belongs to the bladder; □ when one is joyful belongs to the Triple Burner; and □ when one is hungry □ pertains to the lower-excreting □.\n\nThe liver’s trigram is Zhen (☳), Thunder.\nThe gallbladder’s trigram is Xun (☴), Wind.\nThe heart’s trigram is Li (☲), Fire.\nThe small intestine’s trigram is Kun (☷), Earth.\nThe lungs’ trigram is Dui (☱), Marsh.\nThe large intestine’s trigram is Qian (☰), Heaven.\nThe kidneys’ trigram is Kan (☵), Water.\nThe bladder’s trigram is Gen (☶), Mountain.\n\nHere ends *The Scripture of Internal Elixir Returning to the Origin*.",
