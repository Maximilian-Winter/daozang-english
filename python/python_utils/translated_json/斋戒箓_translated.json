  "full_translation": "**Purification Register**\n*Sutra Title: Purification Register. One fascicle.*\n*Source text: Zhengtong Daoist Canon, Dongxuan Section, Precepts and Disciplines Category.*\n\nThe practice of entering stillness to cultivate the Dao fundamentally relies on purification and precepts. By restraining the mouth and guarding against transgressions, one gradually ascends the Way.\n\nThe *Nanhua Perfected Scripture* states: Yan Hui asked the Dao of Confucius, who replied, \"You must purify yourself; then I shall speak to you.\" Yan Hui said, \"I dwell in poverty and have long abstained from wine and meat.\" Confucius said, \"That is the purification for sacrifices, not the purification of the heart. Focus your mind single-pointedly: do not listen with the ears but with the heart; do not listen with the heart but with *qi*. Dredge and clarify your mind, cleanse and refine your spirit, cast aside and strike down your cunning thoughts. Then I shall speak to you. The Dao is obscure and difficult to express; I shall attempt to convey its essence.\"\n\nThe *Sacred Records of the Primordial August Emperor* states: According to the scriptures, purification methods are broadly of three kinds:\n1. **Offering Purification**—to accumulate virtue and dissolve transgressions.\n2. **Fasting Purification**—to harmonize the spirit and preserve longevity. This is the purification for sacrifices, practiced by middling adepts.\n3. **Heart Purification**—to dredge and clarify the heart, eliminating cravings; to cleanse and refine the spirit, removing defilements; to strike down cunning and sever thoughts. Without thoughts or worries, one concentrates on the Dao; without cravings or desires, one delights in the Dao; without defilements or burdens, one unites with the Dao. Since the heart harbors no dual intentions, it is called \"single-mindedness\"—this is the practice of superior adepts.\n\nPurification (*zhai*) means \"to align.\" Aligning and rectifying the three karmic actions constitutes purification. If one merely observes fasting without aligning the heart, or if one merely maintains single-mindedness without restraining the mouth from gluttony, these two methods must complement each other internally and externally.\n\nThe *Great Precepts Sutra* states: \"Calm the mind and still the thoughts, focus single-pointedly without distraction. Do not indulge in flavors beyond noon. Maintain inner and outer purity and emptiness.\" Though you are somewhat familiar with fasting, you have not yet mastered the regulation of the heart. Thus, I reveal the method of purification to enable you to receive the Dao. Yet how many among the late learners can truly empty the heart and focus single-pointedly?\n\nThose who cling to the teachings of sacrificial purification, believing they have grasped the principle of heart purification, commit the error of arrogance and negligence. Though they speak of emptiness and stillness, they fail to comprehend its essence—this is self-conceit.\n\n---\n\n**Six Purifications and Ten Days of Abstinence in the Dongxuan Lingbao Tradition**\n\n**Five Daoist Precepts:**\n1. Do not kill living beings.\n2. Do not indulge in intoxicants.\n3. Do not engage in duplicity (speaking one way while thinking another).\n4. Do not steal.\n5. Do not engage in licentious conduct.\n\n**Ten Virtues:**\n1. Cultivate filial piety toward parents.\n2. Cultivate loyalty in serving rulers and teachers.\n3. Cultivate compassion toward all beings.\n4. Cultivate forbearance and tolerance of wrongs.\n5. Cultivate admonition against evil.\n6. Cultivate self-sacrifice to aid the destitute.\n7. Cultivate the liberation of beings, nurturing creatures, and planting fruit groves.\n8. Cultivate digging wells by roadsides, planting trees, and building bridges.\n9. Cultivate benefiting others, eliminating harm, and instructing the unenlightened.\n10. Cultivate reciting the scriptures and precepts of the Three Treasures, and perpetually offering incense, flowers, and ritual implements.\n\nThose who constantly practice these Five Precepts and Ten Virtues will perpetually be protected by celestial and divine beings, forever dispelling calamities and perpetually attaining blessings—provided their resolve remains steadfast.\n\n---\n\n**Six Annual Purifications:**\nThe first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months.\n\n**Ten Monthly Purifications:**\n1. The first day: beneath the Northern Dipper.\n2. The eighth day: beneath the Northern Dipper’s Officer of Execution.\n3. The fourteenth day: beneath the Messenger of the Great One.\n4. The fifteenth day: beneath the Heavenly Thearch and the Three Officials.\n5. The eighteenth day: beneath the Heavenly Thearch.\n6. The twenty-third day: beneath the Eight Divine Messengers of the Great One.\n7. The twenty-fourth day: beneath the Northern Asterism.\n8. The twenty-eighth day: beneath the Lower Great One.\n9. The twenty-ninth day: beneath the Middle Great One.\n10. The thirtieth day: beneath the Upper Great One.\n\nOn the days of the Lower, Middle, and Upper Great Ones, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, along with all the revered deities, descend to traverse the world, observing the good and evil of humanity. On *jiazi* days, the Great One reviews the gods; on *gengshen* days, the Crouching Corpses report human transgressions; on one’s natal day, merits and conduct are tallied; on the eight seasonal nodes, eight spirits record human good and evil; on the Three Primordials, the Three Officials assess human blessings and transgressions.\n\n---\n\n**Six Kinds of Purification:**\n\n1. **As stated in the *Great Treatise of the Daoist Gate*, the Upper Clarity Purification has three methods:**\n   - Withdrawing from the crowd to seclude oneself, stilling the *qi* and transcending form.\n   - Purifying the altar and solemnizing the assembly, adhering to the rites of the Great Perfected.\n   - **Heart Purification**—dredging and clarifying the heart, cleansing and refining the spirit.\n\n2. **The Numinous Treasure Purification has six methods:**\n   - **Golden Register Purification**—to protect and stabilize the realm.\n   - **Yellow Register Purification**—to save the world and ancestral lineages.\n   - **Illuminating the Perfected Purification**—to repent the sins of the Nine Dark Realms.\n   - **Three Primordials Purification**—to confess and rectify violations of precepts.\n   - **Eight Nodes Purification**—to repent past and present transgressions.\n   - **Spontaneous Purification**—to pray for blessings on behalf of the people.\n\n3. **Cavern Spirit Purification**—prioritizes refinement and simplicity, transcending the mundane to unite with the singular spirit.\n\n4. **Great One Purification**—prioritizes reverence and solemnity.\n\n5. **Instructional Purification**—values purity and simplicity.\n\n6. **Mud and Charcoal Purification**—values diligence and austerity.\n\nAll the above purifications, from ancient times to the present, involve ascending the altar to pledge vows and invoke the Perfected Sages. They may last three, seven, nine, or fifteen days, with rituals conducted in the six periods of day and night—circulating scriptures, reciting repentances, and observing solemn rites.\n\nApart from the Upper Clarity’s seclusion, stilling of *qi*, and Heart Purification, the remaining purifications are performed for kings, the people, and Daoist adepts to deliver ancestors, atone for personal transgressions, avert disasters, and invoke blessings. Over time, variations have arisen, and some are abbreviated within the Numinous Treasure Purifications as \"half-day purifications,\" lacking prearranged invitations or merit recitations. They may involve repentance for one or two periods, omitting the threefold incense offerings, pacing the void, and scripture prostrations.\n\nIn minor purifications, one may perform the Three Bows and chant aspirations, adapting the rites to time and convenience, for they are not grand assemblies—merely a matter of heart’s comprehension.\n\n**Two Kinds of Purifications**\nThe *Sutra of Original Appearance* states: Purifications are of two kinds—one for delivering the Dao, the other for salvation.\nDelivering the Dao means those who resolve to cultivate the Dao, from beginning to end, maintaining purification in every thought without retreat. This has two aspects: the mind of resolve and the extinguished mind.\nThe mind of resolve entails unwavering intent from start to finish, whether in motion or stillness, as still as cold ashes or withered wood, dissolving all thoughts to attain singularity.\nThe extinguished mind means thoughts arise and vanish without attachment, the spirit roams unbound, returning the heart to stillness until reaching the Dao’s sanctuary.\nSalvation means turning the heart toward the Dao, yearning for the mysterious and true, wishing boundless blessings to descend and disasters to vanish before they arise.\nIt is also said: Those of sincere heart devote themselves wholly, with utmost sincerity, burning incense and prostrating, seeking only the Dao. Those who offer wealth procure fine incense, oils, delicacies, and provisions, inviting Daoist masters and even ordinary vessels, dedicating their hearts to supplicate the Perfected, inwardly dissolving the six dusts, outwardly aligning with all realms, calming the mind and settling thoughts to return the spirit to the Dao, thereby perfecting the Dao’s fruit, eternally uniting with non-action, delivering the living and the dead, rescuing from suffering, and according to one’s capacity, blessings descend without fail. The weight of merit and virtue depends on the moment.\n\n**Twelve Purifications**\nThe *Great Treatise on the Daoist Gate* lists:\n1. **Golden Register Purification**, which averts celestial disasters and safeguards the emperor (the *Jianwen* also states: it benefits masters and friends);\n2. **Jade Register Purification**, as the *Zongyun* notes: primarily for the people, though this version is no longer practiced;\n3. **Yellow Register Purification**, which delivers the roots of hell’s sins and opens the path for the nine darknesses and seven ancestors;\n4. **Upper Clarity Purification**, for seeking immortality, contemplating the true, refining form, and concealing radiance;\n5. **Illuminating the True Purification**, where adepts deliver the souls of countless ancestors from eternal night;\n6. **Instructional Purification**, for accumulating blessings, atoning for sins, averting disasters, and healing illnesses;\n7. **Suffering Purification**, for expiating sins, averting calamities, invoking blessings, and delivering fate;\n8. **Three Primes Purification**, where adepts repent their own sins;\n9. **Eight Festivals Purification**, where adepts atone for transgressions and seek immortality;\n10. **Three Sovereigns’ Midnight-Noon Purification**, to assist the emperor and secure the nation’s borders;\n11. **Tranquil Purification**, such as the thousand-day, hundred-day, three-day, or seven-day purifications for cultivating the true;\n12. **Natural Purification**, which delivers all the living and the dead, practiced in accordance with the seasons.\n\n**Eight Festivals Purification**\nOn the days of the eight festivals, when the heavens celebrate their grand assemblies, the great sages and divine lords of the heavens gather in the Mystic Capital of the Numinous Treasure and the Upper Palace of Jade Capital to pay homage to the celestial perfected, uphold precepts, maintain purifications, and recite scriptures. Those who practice purification, observe precepts, and revere celestial patterns on these days are commended by the Five Emperors and their names inscribed in the Jade Chronicle.\n\n**Heart Purification**\nThe *True Scripture of Southern Florescence* records: Yan Yuan asked Confucius about the Dao. Confucius said, “Purify yourself, and I will tell you.”\nYan Yuan replied, “I am poor and have long abstained from wine and meat.”\nConfucius said, “That is the purification for sacrifices, not the purification of the heart. Focus your will, do not listen with your ears but with your heart, do not listen with your heart but with your *qi*. Empty your heart to dispel desires; cleanse your spirit to remove impurities; strike down your intellect to sever thoughts. Without thoughts or concerns, you will concentrate on the Dao; without desires or cravings, you will delight in the Dao; without impurities or burdens, you will unite with the Dao. Since the heart harbors no dual thoughts, it is called singular resolve.”\n\n**Purification Vigil**\nThe *Inner Explanation of the Three Heavens Sutra* states: For those learning the Dao, nothing precedes purification. Externally, it prevents contamination by dust and filth; internally, it purifies the five viscera, invites the true, and summons the divine to dwell in harmony with the Dao. Those who maintain long purifications unite with the true and do not violate prohibitions. Thus, the Celestial Master’s teachings say: Learning the Dao without purification vigil is like walking at night without a torch—this vigil should be the foremost practice for Dao seekers.\nThose who wish to invoke the unseen and establish purification vigils should first perform a dispersive purification, avoiding residual impurities, eliminating foul odors, and cleansing the body so no defilement remains before entering purification. Otherwise, mere washing will leave impurities within the flesh, and even scalding water cannot remove them.\nThe *Rites of the Three Primes* states: On the day of establishing purification, one should present the golden truth and jade radiance as tokens to the Nine Heavens, offering them to the Five Emperors to summon the divine and invoke the numinous.\nThe *Rites of the Three Primes* also states: If one’s mastery of the methods is incomplete, many postures and gestures will not conform to the rites.\nThe *Sutra of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* says: In ancient times, purification was called *social gathering*; now it is termed *purification assembly*.\nThe *Canons of the Supreme and Great Perfected* state: Dispel worldly affairs and cultivate the three karmas. Purification entails preserving the three and guarding the one—purification is the foundation. Purification means alignment, purity, and rectification. It need not involve the six periods of ritual, three periods of recitation, or day-and-night contemplation, repentance, and invocation of blessings—such efforts scatter into the void and miss the essence. To attain one is to govern the three karmas with the heart; to govern the body is to sit upright and undisturbed; to govern the mouth is to silently comprehend the profound; to govern the heart is to unite spirit with the Dao. Those who master this become perfected immortals. Those who have not yet achieved this should govern the body through prostrations, abstaining from killing, stealing, and lust; govern the mouth through scripture recitation, avoiding false speech, frivolous words, divisive talk, and cursing; and govern the heart by preserving the spirit, relinquishing greed, anger, and delusion. Once the ten evils are cast aside, the ten virtues naturally arise. When departure and arrival reach their utmost, one unites with the true and the Dao.\n\nThe Nine Methods of Observing Fasting\n\nThe *Profound Gateway Treatise* states: The methods of fasting broadly comprise nine types. The first is coarse food; the second, vegetable fare; the third, moderated intake; the fourth, consuming essences; the fifth, consuming sprouts; the sixth, consuming radiance; the seventh, consuming qi; the eighth, consuming primordial qi; and the ninth, embryonic sustenance.\n\nCoarse food refers to hemp and wheat; vegetable fare, to greens and herbs; moderated intake, to the middle meal. Consuming essences means talismanic water and elixir flowers; consuming sprouts, the cloud-teeth of the five directions; consuming radiance, the sun, moon, seven luminaries, and three lights. Consuming qi refers to the qi of the six senses and the wondrous qi of Grand Harmony from the four directions; consuming primordial qi, to all the qi received from the Three Origins, the essence of Grand Harmony abiding in the Great Void. Embryonic sustenance is the harmony of one’s own received primordial essence, the origin of the embryonic sac—namely, the qi of purity and emptiness descending through the four limbs, no longer dependent on external sources.\n\nCoarse food curbs all cravings; vegetable fare forsakes all rich and fatty indulgences.\n\nModerated intake dispels vexation and turbidity; consuming essences refines the body so that the gods within become radiant and adorned. Consuming sprouts transforms one into sprouts; consuming radiance transforms one into radiance. Consuming the six qi transforms one into the six qi, roaming the ten directions; consuming primordial qi transforms one into primordial qi, merging one’s body with Heaven and Earth. Consuming embryonic qi over time makes one an infant child, blending indistinguishably with the Dao.\n\nThrough these transformations, one undergoes ceaseless change, no longer awaiting the casting-off of the body to receive another, nor subject to the cycles of death and rebirth. The methods of present intent need not be limited to matters of diet; they may also involve medicinal recipes, massage, and the like.\n\n**On Miscellaneous Fasting Methods**\nThe *Scripture of Precepts Ranked by the Three Origins* states: The seventh day of the first month is the day when the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water conduct their inspections; one may perform a fast on this day.\n\nThe *Sacred Records* states: The seventh day of the first month is called the Fast of Promotion and Reward; the seventh day of the seventh month is called the Fast of Celebrating Life’s Midpoint; the fifth day of the tenth month is called the Great Fast of Establishing Life. On these days, the Three Officials review merits and transgressions; by fasting and presenting petitions, one may pray for abundant blessings.\n\nThe *Luminous Perfection Regulations* states: The first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months of the year are the six fasting months. Those who observe these fasts cause the Emperors of the Three Heavens to dispatch the Envoys of Grand Unity to relieve people of ten sufferings.\n\nThe *Secret Words of the Eightfold Dao* states: The first, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh months are the nine fasting months of the Perfected; the first, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth days of each month are the three fasting days within the month. The first day of the first month is called the Heavenly *La*; the fifth day of the fifth month, the Earthly *La*; the seventh day of the seventh month, the *La* of Dao and Virtue; the first day of the tenth month, the *La* of the People’s Year; and the festival day of the twelfth month, the *La* of Lords and Kings. On these five *La* days, one should perform fasts and offer sacrifices to ancestors.\n\nThe *Luminous Perfection Regulations* states: The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of each month are the ten straight fasting days. On *Gengshen*, *Jiazi*, and the eight solar terms, the Eight Spirits of Grand Unity descend to examine people’s transgressions. Fasting brings joy to Grand Unity.\n\nOn *Gengshen* days, the concealed corpses within the human body ascend to Heaven to report sins; on one’s natal day, the divine officers and soldiers of the body’s gods ascend to Heaven to tally merits and transgressions.\n\nThe *Daoist Regulations for the Three Caverns* states: The first day of the first month is the Fast of Offering Longevity; the seventh day, the Fast of Extending the Spirits; the eighth day of the second month, the Fragrant Spring Fast; the eighth day of the fourth month, the Fast of Commencing Summer; the fifth day of the fifth month, the Fast of Continuing Life; the sixth day of the sixth month, the Fast of Clearing Summer Heat; the seventh day of the seventh month, the Fast of Welcoming Autumn; the first day of the eighth month, the Fast of Expelling Evil; the ninth day of the ninth month, the Fast of Extending Lifespan; the first day of the tenth month, the Fast of Completing Blessings; the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, the Fast of Initiating Blessings; the *La* day of the twelfth month, the Fast of a Hundred Blessings; and the twenty-eighth day, the Fast of Welcoming the New.\n\nThe *Li* of spring is the Fast of Establishing Goodness; the spring equinox, the Fast of Extending Blessings; the *Li* of summer, the Fast of Prolonging Goodness; the summer solstice, the Fast of Vermilion Brightness; the *Li* of autumn, the Fast of Distant Longevity; the autumn equinox, the Fast of Atoning for Sins; the *Li* of winter, the Fast of Following Goodness; and the winter solstice, the Fast of Broad Celebration. Each of these fasts has its own scriptural rites and forms. Thus, those who study the Dao yet do not observe fasting and precepts labor in vain in the mountains and forests.\n\nNow, the fast is fundamentally about purity, emptiness, tranquility, humility, reverence, trembling caution—as though treading on ice or a ravine, or standing before a stern lord—with sincere devotion and utmost modesty, earnestly seeking divine response. One must examine and restrain both inner and outer conduct, allowing no disorder or distraction.\n\nThose who perform fasts must strictly avoid those in mourning, newly delivered women, women during menstruation, and those suffering from malaria, sores, scabies, or other illnesses; none of these may ascend the fasting hall, courtyard, or altar, nor be employed as attendants. Those who desperately seek to join the fast or beg for absolution of transgressions may submit written petitions to confess and repent, but they may not enter the hall or temple precincts. For those performing ritual matters, arrange separate seating, and also avoid the presence of the six livestock. For such people defile the true spirits, and the worthies and sages will not descend—thus, the fast yields no merit.\n\nIn all cases, the host of the fast must be devout, and the officiating officials must be solemn. Even the lack of proper incense and lamps is considered negligence; in invoking the sages and praying to the Perfected, nothing takes precedence over these.\n\nIncense is most valued when made of aloeswood, sandalwood, or *chenxiang*. According to the *Shangqing* tradition, incense should be blended into pearl-like pellets, and musk from deer glands must not be used. To summon the Perfected and invoke the spirits, one must maintain utmost sincerity and focus. For impoverished Daoist practitioners living in seclusion who cannot afford these, even a small offering suffices as a token; one must not allow a complete absence. However, using only milk-based incense is not in accordance with Daoist practice.\n\nWhen first entering the fasting chamber, observe the direction in which the incense smoke rises: if it ascends straight toward the east, south, west, or north, the Five Emperors will arrive in accordance with its direction.\n\nThe *Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection* states: Incense is what the celestial Perfected use to establish communication, and what the earthly deities rely upon to convey sincerity. Whether in fasting, purification, prayer, or contemplation, one must burn incense on both sides, and the Golden Lads attending the incense will surely summon the Perfected and convey one’s intent.\n\nThe *Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection* states: The Perfected harness the radiance of the sun to illuminate, and command the essence of the moon to brighten the obscure. Thus, lighting the nine subtle lamps of ninefold light illumines the eight directions through the deepest night.\n\nThe *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles* states: At the *Li* of spring and the spring equinox, light nine lamps in the courtyard; at the *Li* of summer and the summer solstice, light eight lamps; at the *Li* of autumn and the autumn equinox, light six lamps; at the *Li* of winter and the winter solstice, light five lamps; on one’s natal day, light twelve lamps. From these, one may present petitions, atone for transgressions, and pray for blessings.\n\nThe method of using lamps in the courtyard aligns with the practice of various fasts, each with its own prescribed number of lamps. Upon completion, face the directional sovereign according to the season, except on one’s natal day, when one faces the Year-Star. Knock the teeth twenty-four times and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Perfected, Myriad Sage Emperors, Jade Lords of the Five Thearchs, Overseers of All Immortals and Perfected: On this auspicious day of the eight solar nodes, I lay bare my yang transgressions and yin offenses, severing the Nine Yin’s bonds. From this day forth, may I be released from the Seven Darks, escape the Fiery Realm, and forever depart the Knife Mountains. May the Three Paths and Five Sufferings never burden my body. May I be as enduring as heaven and earth, ever safeguarded by the Celestial Dawn. May the Five Vows and Eight Assemblies all come to pass as spoken.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, remove the headscarf and bow one hundred and twenty times, pressing the forehead to the ground without causing pain. Upon finishing, replace the headscarf and look to the heavens, contemplating: *\"Today, my body offers reverence to the Celestial Grace, receiving the gift of restored form and the rebirth of a flying immortal.\"* Conclude by inhaling twenty-four breaths of qi, facing upward. After three years of this practice, all accumulated transgressions will be eradicated, and one’s body will become as the Perfected.\n\nAccording to the methods of fasting in the scriptures, there are roughly three kinds:\n1. **Offering Fasts**, which accumulate virtue and absolve transgressions.\n2. **Abstentional Fasts**, which harmonize the spirit and preserve longevity—these are the fasts of sacrificial rites, practiced by those of middling attainment.\n3. **Heart Fasts**, which entail purifying the heart, eliminating desires, cleansing the spirit, and shedding impurities; shattering worldly wisdom and severing discursive thought. Without thought or worry, one concentrates on the Dao; without craving or desire, one delights in the Dao; without impurity or burden, one unites with the Dao. As the heart holds no dualistic thoughts, it is called *\"single-mindedness\"*—this is the practice of the highest adepts, and it is most profound.\n\n*\"Fasting\"* (斋) means *\"to align\"* (齐): one must align and rectify the three karmic actions to truly fast. If one merely observes abstention from food while the heart and mind remain unaligned, or if one’s focus is solely on singular intent, then the mouth’s abstention from gluttony is but one aspect. The two methods—outer form and inner essence—mutually reinforce each other. Thus, the *Sutra of Great Precepts* states: *\"A level heart and tranquil silence, undivided focus; no indulgence after midday; inner and outer purity and emptiness.\"*\n\nThough I am but slightly versed in dietary restraint, I have yet to master the regulation of the heart. Hence, these fasting methods are taught to those receiving the Dao. Yet how many among the unlearned can truly empty their hearts and maintain singular intent? Those who dismiss the teachings of sacrificial rites, claiming to have grasped the principle of the Heart Fast, fall into the error of negligence. Though they speak of stillness, their eyes betray no understanding—this is but self-conceit. The *Book of Changes* says: *\"The sage uses this for fasting and vigil.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Fasting Regulations**\nThe Daoist Wang Can, a native of Jintan, dwelled on Mount Maji. He was ever devoted to secret acts of kindness, extending his benevolence even to the lowliest creatures. At the end of the Jin dynasty, when the Central Plains were ravaged by chaos, famine and pestilence struck in succession. Toxic miasmas claimed many lives, villages lay desolate, and the dead piled like kindling.\n\nIn his secluded chamber, Wang Can submitted a flying memorial to the Mysterious, weeping for three nights. On the third night, a light as bright as day illuminated his courtyard. Auspicious winds and rosy clouds swirled in the sky. Suddenly, the fragrance of rare incense and celestial music descended into his garden. Over thirty armored warriors, clad in metal and wielding weapons, arrayed themselves as if awaiting orders. Soon after, pearl-encrusted banners, jeweled canopies, rainbow streamers, and feathered standards—each borne by two attendants—preceded a procession. At the rear, four azure youths carried flowers and incense, while maidens bore trays. A brocade mat was spread upon the ground, before which stood a great screen. Flanking it were dragon and tiger generals, officers, and soldiers—some two thousand in all—standing in formation as if on guard.\n\nTwenty-six golden-armored generals and ten divine kings took their places beyond the dragon and tiger lords, their ranks impeccably ordered. In an instant, the air filled with the sound of flutes and pipes from the northwest, accompanied by radiant, multicolored blossoms. A figure, sword at his side and tablet in hand, approached Wang Can and announced: *\"The Most High Lord of the Dao has arrived.\"*\n\nThen, a throne of myriad treasures descended from the sky. The Most High Lord of the Dao, attended by two Perfected Ones and two Celestial Emperors, took his seat. The Lord sat upon a five-colored lotus, while the two Perfected and two Emperors stood in attendance. Wang Can bowed in reverence, prostrating himself upon the ground.\n\nThe Lord of the Dao spoke: *\"You, moved by compassion for the people, have expressed your intent through memorials and offerings, carving out your heart and shedding your blood. Your sincerity has stirred the unseen and the manifest; the Earth Bureau has recorded your name. The nurturing of all things relies upon the Five Phases, which interact through mutual conquest, each with its rise and fall. Their ceaseless alternation allows no respite, and thus life persists, qi succeeding qi across eons without pause. Those who attain life ascend as immortals, uniting with pure yang; those who meet death sink into the depths of yin, becoming ghosts upon the earth. Among ghostly beings, there are distinctions of superiority and inferiority, strength and weakness, firmness and gentleness, goodness and evil—no different from the mortal world.*\n\n*The Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Honored One, fearing the wanton harm inflicted by ghosts and spirits upon humanity, has commanded the Five Emperors and the Three Officials to enforce the laws, statutes, and penal codes governing their regulation—all of which are clear and comprehensive. Yet in this degenerate age, the people are steeped in deceit, their pure origins scattered. Heresy and treachery arise, loyalty to rulers and filial piety to families decay. The teachings of the Three Bonds and Five Constants are abandoned, and the people cast themselves into the realm of death. Thus, the stale qi of the Six Heavens and the legions of demonic ghosts, along with the defeated armies and slain generals of past ages, band together to assail the living. They ride the winds and rains, seizing opportunities in times of weakness to inflict myriad illnesses, causing great harm. Some, robbed of their allotted years, meet untimely ends. For this reason, the *Divine Incantation Sutra* was revealed in the Duyang Palace and bestowed upon the Perfected Tang Ping, to be disseminated for the salvation of all beings. It now exists among the people.\"*\n\n\"People of the world hear the names of Wang Jian and Bai Qi and dismiss them as mere fables. Yet these are but generals of old—while living, they commanded armies; in death, they become ghostly marshals. Those who rendered meritorious service are promoted to offices in the unseen realm, while the cruel and destructive remain among the ranks of demons. They ride the corrupt qi of the Five Phases, bringing afflictions and plagues. However, through the awe of yang power and the subjugation of divine incantations, they may yet be quelled.\n\nNow, I bestow upon you both the *Scripture of Divine Transformation* and the *Scripture of Divine Incantations*. Practice them diligently to shield and succor the countless multitudes. Then, commanding his attendant youths to unveil the radiance of the Nine Lights, he conferred upon Zuan the *Scripture of Divine Transformation* along with the *Essentials of the Three and Five Great Fasts*, saying: 'Apply yourself earnestly, for with each act of hidden merit, the ascent to Perfection may be hoped for.'\n\nAs his words concluded, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders rose toward the northwest, ascending to the Supreme Clarity. Zuan, following the scriptural ranks and fasts, propagated them throughout the lands south of the Yangtze. Epidemics waned, and the living thrived in peace. From the Jin dynasty to the present, those who have universally received its blessings are beyond count.\n\n**On Observing Fasts**\nThe *Supreme Secret Essentials* states: Once, a Daoist observed a fast and recited scriptures. A layman was hired to prepare the kitchen and fasting hall. Seeing his sincerity, the Daoist, when the midday fast was observed, called him to share the meal. After eating, he expounded the Dharma, telling the laborer: 'By keeping this fast with me today, your merit is vast. Return tomorrow at midday to eat again, but do not break your fast—lest your efforts be in vain. Should you persist, you may escape worldly calamities in this very life.'\n\nThe man bowed deeply, received the precepts, and departed. That evening, upon returning home, his wife had awaited her husband all day. He recounted the Daoist’s admonitions to her.\"\n\nThe wife, failing to comprehend, grew furious. The laborer could not resist his wife’s insistence and thus broke his fast, sharing a meal with her. Later, when his life ended, heavenly decree made him the spirit of a thousand-year-old tree on Mount Shu, where he was regularly provided with midday sustenance, causing the tree to flourish. During the scorching summer months, three diligent and virtuous men passed by and rested beneath its shade. One of them sighed, saying: \"Though this tree offers coolness, the sun has already reached midday—how shall we find food?\" The tree spirit replied: \"I shall prepare a midday meal for you, noble ones; have no concern.\" Soon, food arrived, and the virtuous men partook together. After eating, they said: \"We seek the Dao—where may it be found? This occurrence is not of the Dao.\" They then asked the tree: \"Might the great spirit briefly descend in form to meet with us?\" The tree spirit answered from the void: \"I am no one who can guide others to the Dao. Recall my name and dwelling place: once, I served a Daoist and was urged to observe a fast, but my wife caused me to break it. My merit incomplete, I was condemned to guard this tree spirit, unable to escape. Heaven, remembering my past midday fasts, now provides me with sustenance at this hour. Yet my mouth is too occupied to eat, and I have no means to advance. I humbly ask, noble ones, to visit my home and explain my plight. If you would observe a three-day fast and precepts on my behalf, I may ascend to heaven.\" Moved by his plea, the virtuous men sought his household and recounted his words. His family then prepared a fast, inviting Daoists to burn incense, recite scriptures, and perform rites of repentance for three days. Thereupon, the spirit soared into the clouds, ascending to the Radiant Empyrean, where he received the register of a wandering immortal.\n\nThus, the merit of fasting is profound and must not be neglected. This man observed but half a day’s fast, yet upon his death the very next day, he was reborn and, within a year, attained immortality. Heaven’s reckoning of merit and transgression is never unjust. Those who cultivate the Dao must diligently observe fasts and precepts, awaiting the unseen response. Whoever perseveres in this practice shall surely attain the ascent to transcendence.\n\n**Miscellaneous Fasting Days and the Three Assemblies**\nThe *Three Assemblies* states:\n\nThe **Three Assemblies** prescribe the following fasts:\nOn the seventh day of the first month, the *Assembly of Promotion and Reward*;\nOn the seventh day of the seventh month, the *Assembly of Celebrating Life*;\nOn the fifth day of the tenth month, the *Grand Assembly of Establishing Life*.\nOn these Three Assembly days, the Three Officials review merits and transgressions. It is fitting to receive talismans and registers, observe fasts, and present memorials to pray for radiant blessings.\n\nThe **Five Laba Days** are:\nThe first day of the first month, called the *Celestial Laba Fast*;\nThe fifth day of the fifth month, called the *Earthly Laba Fast*;\nThe seventh day of the seventh month, called the *Dao-Virtue Laba Fast*;\nThe first day of the tenth month, called the *People’s Yearly Laba Fast*;\nThe festival day of the twelfth month, called the *Lords’ Laba Fast*.\nOn these Five Laba days, one should always offer sacrifices to departed ancestors, thereby becoming a filial child and gaining boundless fortune. All other days are deemed excessive sacrifices.\n\nIncluding the previous Three Origin Days, these make the **Eight Liberation Days**, on which one may set forth pure offerings to seek blessings.\n\nThe *Mingzhen Ordinances* state:\nOn *jiǎzǐ* days at midnight, and on *jiǎxū* days at dusk, the Perfected Officials of the Heavenly August descend.\nOn *jiǎshēn* days at the afternoon meal hour, and on *jiǎwǔ* days at noon, the Perfected Officials of the Earthly August descend.\nOn *jiǎchén* days at breakfast hour, and on *jiǎyín* days at the hour of the sun’s level ascent, the Perfected Officials of the Human August descend.\nOn these days, when one observes a fast, the Divine Lords of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, each according to their directional positions, scrutinize good and evil, all of which is reported on high.\n\nFurther:\nOn *dīngmǎo* days at sunrise, and on *dīngchǒu* days at cockcrow, the Perfected Officials of the Heavenly August descend.\nOn *dīngyǒu* days at sunset, and on *dīnghài* days at the hour of human rest, the Perfected Officials of the Earthly August descend.\nOn *dīngwèi* days at the hour of the sun’s decline, and on *dīngsì* days at the mid-afternoon hour, the Perfected Officials of the Human August descend.\nOn these days, when one observes a fast, the Perfected Ones of the Five Peaks each dispatch five spirits to guard and protect, recording names in the registers of immortals.\nThus concludes the fast, precepts, and register.",

      "translated_text": "**Purification Register**\n*Sutra Title: Purification Register. One fascicle.*\n*Source text: Zhengtong Daoist Canon, Dongxuan Section, Precepts and Disciplines Category.*\n\nThe practice of entering stillness to cultivate the Dao fundamentally relies on purification and precepts. By restraining the mouth and guarding against transgressions, one gradually ascends the Way.\n\nThe *Nanhua Perfected Scripture* states: Yan Hui asked the Dao of Confucius, who replied, \"You must purify yourself; then I shall speak to you.\" Yan Hui said, \"I dwell in poverty and have long abstained from wine and meat.\" Confucius said, \"That is the purification for sacrifices, not the purification of the heart. Focus your mind single-pointedly: do not listen with the ears but with the heart; do not listen with the heart but with *qi*. Dredge and clarify your mind, cleanse and refine your spirit, cast aside and strike down your cunning thoughts. Then I shall speak to you. The Dao is obscure and difficult to express; I shall attempt to convey its essence.\"\n\nThe *Sacred Records of the Primordial August Emperor* states: According to the scriptures, purification methods are broadly of three kinds:\n1. **Offering Purification**—to accumulate virtue and dissolve transgressions.\n2. **Fasting Purification**—to harmonize the spirit and preserve longevity. This is the purification for sacrifices, practiced by middling adepts.\n3. **Heart Purification**—to dredge and clarify the heart, eliminating cravings; to cleanse and refine the spirit, removing defilements; to strike down cunning and sever thoughts. Without thoughts or worries, one concentrates on the Dao; without cravings or desires, one delights in the Dao; without defilements or burdens, one unites with the Dao. Since the heart harbors no dual intentions, it is called \"single-mindedness\"—this is the practice of superior adepts.\n\nPurification (*zhai*) means \"to align.\" Aligning and rectifying the three karmic actions constitutes purification. If one merely observes fasting without aligning the heart, or if one merely maintains single-mindedness without restraining the mouth from gluttony, these two methods must complement each other internally and externally.\n\nThe *Great Precepts Sutra* states: \"Calm the mind and still the thoughts, focus single-pointedly without distraction. Do not indulge in flavors beyond noon. Maintain inner and outer purity and emptiness.\" Though you are somewhat familiar with fasting, you have not yet mastered the regulation of the heart. Thus, I reveal the method of purification to enable you to receive the Dao. Yet how many among the late learners can truly empty the heart and focus single-pointedly?\n\nThose who cling to the teachings of sacrificial purification, believing they have grasped the principle of heart purification, commit the error of arrogance and negligence. Though they speak of emptiness and stillness, they fail to comprehend its essence—this is self-conceit.\n\n---\n\n**Six Purifications and Ten Days of Abstinence in the Dongxuan Lingbao Tradition**\n\n**Five Daoist Precepts:**\n1. Do not kill living beings.\n2. Do not indulge in intoxicants.\n3. Do not engage in duplicity (speaking one way while thinking another).\n4. Do not steal.\n5. Do not engage in licentious conduct.\n\n**Ten Virtues:**\n1. Cultivate filial piety toward parents.\n2. Cultivate loyalty in serving rulers and teachers.\n3. Cultivate compassion toward all beings.\n4. Cultivate forbearance and tolerance of wrongs.\n5. Cultivate admonition against evil.\n6. Cultivate self-sacrifice to aid the destitute.\n7. Cultivate the liberation of beings, nurturing creatures, and planting fruit groves.\n8. Cultivate digging wells by roadsides, planting trees, and building bridges.\n9. Cultivate benefiting others, eliminating harm, and instructing the unenlightened.\n10. Cultivate reciting the scriptures and precepts of the Three Treasures, and perpetually offering incense, flowers, and ritual implements.\n\nThose who constantly practice these Five Precepts and Ten Virtues will perpetually be protected by celestial and divine beings, forever dispelling calamities and perpetually attaining blessings—provided their resolve remains steadfast.\n\n---\n\n**Six Annual Purifications:**\nThe first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months.\n\n**Ten Monthly Purifications:**\n1. The first day: beneath the Northern Dipper.\n2. The eighth day: beneath the Northern Dipper’s Officer of Execution.\n3. The fourteenth day: beneath the Messenger of the Great One.\n4. The fifteenth day: beneath the Heavenly Thearch and the Three Officials.\n5. The eighteenth day: beneath the Heavenly Thearch.\n6. The twenty-third day: beneath the Eight Divine Messengers of the Great One.\n7. The twenty-fourth day: beneath the Northern Asterism.\n8. The twenty-eighth day: beneath the Lower Great One.\n9. The twenty-ninth day: beneath the Middle Great One.\n10. The thirtieth day: beneath the Upper Great One.\n\nOn the days of the Lower, Middle, and Upper Great Ones, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, along with all the revered deities, descend to traverse the world, observing the good and evil of humanity. On *jiazi* days, the Great One reviews the gods; on *gengshen* days, the Crouching Corpses report human transgressions; on one’s natal day, merits and conduct are tallied; on the eight seasonal nodes, eight spirits record human good and evil; on the Three Primordials, the Three Officials assess human blessings and transgressions.\n\n---\n\n**Six Kinds of Purification:**\n\n1. **As stated in the *Great Treatise of the Daoist Gate*, the Upper Clarity Purification has three methods:**\n   - Withdrawing from the crowd to seclude oneself, stilling the *qi* and transcending form.\n   - Purifying the altar and solemnizing the assembly, adhering to the rites of the Great Perfected.\n   - **Heart Purification**—dredging and clarifying the heart, cleansing and refining the spirit.\n\n2. **The Numinous Treasure Purification has six methods:**\n   - **Golden Register Purification**—to protect and stabilize the realm.\n   - **Yellow Register Purification**—to save the world and ancestral lineages.\n   - **Illuminating the Perfected Purification**—to repent the sins of the Nine Dark Realms.\n   - **Three Primordials Purification**—to confess and rectify violations of precepts.\n   - **Eight Nodes Purification**—to repent past and present transgressions.\n   - **Spontaneous Purification**—to pray for blessings on behalf of the people.\n\n3. **Cavern Spirit Purification**—prioritizes refinement and simplicity, transcending the mundane to unite with the singular spirit.\n\n4. **Great One Purification**—prioritizes reverence and solemnity.\n\n5. **Instructional Purification**—values purity and simplicity.\n\n6. **Mud and Charcoal Purification**—values diligence and austerity.\n\nAll the above purifications, from ancient times to the present, involve ascending the altar to pledge vows and invoke the Perfected Sages. They may last three, seven, nine, or fifteen days, with rituals conducted in the six periods of day and night—circulating scriptures, reciting repentances, and observing solemn rites.\n\nApart from the Upper Clarity’s seclusion, stilling of *qi*, and Heart Purification, the remaining purifications are performed for kings, the people, and Daoist adepts to deliver ancestors, atone for personal transgressions, avert disasters, and invoke blessings. Over time, variations have arisen, and some are abbreviated within the Numinous Treasure Purifications as \"half-day purifications,\" lacking prearranged invitations or merit recitations. They may involve repentance for one or two periods, omitting the threefold incense offerings, pacing the void, and scripture prostrations.",

      "translated_text": "In minor purifications, one may perform the Three Bows and chant aspirations, adapting the rites to time and convenience, for they are not grand assemblies—merely a matter of heart’s comprehension.\n\n**Two Kinds of Purifications**\nThe *Sutra of Original Appearance* states: Purifications are of two kinds—one for delivering the Dao, the other for salvation.\nDelivering the Dao means those who resolve to cultivate the Dao, from beginning to end, maintaining purification in every thought without retreat. This has two aspects: the mind of resolve and the extinguished mind.\nThe mind of resolve entails unwavering intent from start to finish, whether in motion or stillness, as still as cold ashes or withered wood, dissolving all thoughts to attain singularity.\nThe extinguished mind means thoughts arise and vanish without attachment, the spirit roams unbound, returning the heart to stillness until reaching the Dao’s sanctuary.\nSalvation means turning the heart toward the Dao, yearning for the mysterious and true, wishing boundless blessings to descend and disasters to vanish before they arise.\nIt is also said: Those of sincere heart devote themselves wholly, with utmost sincerity, burning incense and prostrating, seeking only the Dao. Those who offer wealth procure fine incense, oils, delicacies, and provisions, inviting Daoist masters and even ordinary vessels, dedicating their hearts to supplicate the Perfected, inwardly dissolving the six dusts, outwardly aligning with all realms, calming the mind and settling thoughts to return the spirit to the Dao, thereby perfecting the Dao’s fruit, eternally uniting with non-action, delivering the living and the dead, rescuing from suffering, and according to one’s capacity, blessings descend without fail. The weight of merit and virtue depends on the moment.\n\n**Twelve Purifications**\nThe *Great Treatise on the Daoist Gate* lists:\n1. **Golden Register Purification**, which averts celestial disasters and safeguards the emperor (the *Jianwen* also states: it benefits masters and friends);\n2. **Jade Register Purification**, as the *Zongyun* notes: primarily for the people, though this version is no longer practiced;\n3. **Yellow Register Purification**, which delivers the roots of hell’s sins and opens the path for the nine darknesses and seven ancestors;\n4. **Upper Clarity Purification**, for seeking immortality, contemplating the true, refining form, and concealing radiance;\n5. **Illuminating the True Purification**, where adepts deliver the souls of countless ancestors from eternal night;\n6. **Instructional Purification**, for accumulating blessings, atoning for sins, averting disasters, and healing illnesses;\n7. **Suffering Purification**, for expiating sins, averting calamities, invoking blessings, and delivering fate;\n8. **Three Primes Purification**, where adepts repent their own sins;\n9. **Eight Festivals Purification**, where adepts atone for transgressions and seek immortality;\n10. **Three Sovereigns’ Midnight-Noon Purification**, to assist the emperor and secure the nation’s borders;\n11. **Tranquil Purification**, such as the thousand-day, hundred-day, three-day, or seven-day purifications for cultivating the true;\n12. **Natural Purification**, which delivers all the living and the dead, practiced in accordance with the seasons.\n\n**Eight Festivals Purification**\nOn the days of the eight festivals, when the heavens celebrate their grand assemblies, the great sages and divine lords of the heavens gather in the Mystic Capital of the Numinous Treasure and the Upper Palace of Jade Capital to pay homage to the celestial perfected, uphold precepts, maintain purifications, and recite scriptures. Those who practice purification, observe precepts, and revere celestial patterns on these days are commended by the Five Emperors and their names inscribed in the Jade Chronicle.\n\n**Heart Purification**\nThe *True Scripture of Southern Florescence* records: Yan Yuan asked Confucius about the Dao. Confucius said, “Purify yourself, and I will tell you.”\nYan Yuan replied, “I am poor and have long abstained from wine and meat.”\nConfucius said, “That is the purification for sacrifices, not the purification of the heart. Focus your will, do not listen with your ears but with your heart, do not listen with your heart but with your *qi*. Empty your heart to dispel desires; cleanse your spirit to remove impurities; strike down your intellect to sever thoughts. Without thoughts or concerns, you will concentrate on the Dao; without desires or cravings, you will delight in the Dao; without impurities or burdens, you will unite with the Dao. Since the heart harbors no dual thoughts, it is called singular resolve.”\n\n**Purification Vigil**\nThe *Inner Explanation of the Three Heavens Sutra* states: For those learning the Dao, nothing precedes purification. Externally, it prevents contamination by dust and filth; internally, it purifies the five viscera, invites the true, and summons the divine to dwell in harmony with the Dao. Those who maintain long purifications unite with the true and do not violate prohibitions. Thus, the Celestial Master’s teachings say: Learning the Dao without purification vigil is like walking at night without a torch—this vigil should be the foremost practice for Dao seekers.\nThose who wish to invoke the unseen and establish purification vigils should first perform a dispersive purification, avoiding residual impurities, eliminating foul odors, and cleansing the body so no defilement remains before entering purification. Otherwise, mere washing will leave impurities within the flesh, and even scalding water cannot remove them.\nThe *Rites of the Three Primes* states: On the day of establishing purification, one should present the golden truth and jade radiance as tokens to the Nine Heavens, offering them to the Five Emperors to summon the divine and invoke the numinous.\nThe *Rites of the Three Primes* also states: If one’s mastery of the methods is incomplete, many postures and gestures will not conform to the rites.\nThe *Sutra of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* says: In ancient times, purification was called *social gathering*; now it is termed *purification assembly*.\nThe *Canons of the Supreme and Great Perfected* state: Dispel worldly affairs and cultivate the three karmas. Purification entails preserving the three and guarding the one—purification is the foundation. Purification means alignment, purity, and rectification. It need not involve the six periods of ritual, three periods of recitation, or day-and-night contemplation, repentance, and invocation of blessings—such efforts scatter into the void and miss the essence. To attain one is to govern the three karmas with the heart; to govern the body is to sit upright and undisturbed; to govern the mouth is to silently comprehend the profound; to govern the heart is to unite spirit with the Dao. Those who master this become perfected immortals. Those who have not yet achieved this should govern the body through prostrations, abstaining from killing, stealing, and lust; govern the mouth through scripture recitation, avoiding false speech, frivolous words, divisive talk, and cursing; and govern the heart by preserving the spirit, relinquishing greed, anger, and delusion. Once the ten evils are cast aside, the ten virtues naturally arise. When departure and arrival reach their utmost, one unites with the true and the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Moderated intake dispels vexation and turbidity; consuming essences refines the body so that the gods within become radiant and adorned. Consuming sprouts transforms one into sprouts; consuming radiance transforms one into radiance. Consuming the six qi transforms one into the six qi, roaming the ten directions; consuming primordial qi transforms one into primordial qi, merging one’s body with Heaven and Earth. Consuming embryonic qi over time makes one an infant child, blending indistinguishably with the Dao.\n\nThrough these transformations, one undergoes ceaseless change, no longer awaiting the casting-off of the body to receive another, nor subject to the cycles of death and rebirth. The methods of present intent need not be limited to matters of diet; they may also involve medicinal recipes, massage, and the like.\n\n**On Miscellaneous Fasting Methods**\nThe *Scripture of Precepts Ranked by the Three Origins* states: The seventh day of the first month is the day when the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water conduct their inspections; one may perform a fast on this day.\n\nThe *Sacred Records* states: The seventh day of the first month is called the Fast of Promotion and Reward; the seventh day of the seventh month is called the Fast of Celebrating Life’s Midpoint; the fifth day of the tenth month is called the Great Fast of Establishing Life. On these days, the Three Officials review merits and transgressions; by fasting and presenting petitions, one may pray for abundant blessings.\n\nThe *Luminous Perfection Regulations* states: The first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months of the year are the six fasting months. Those who observe these fasts cause the Emperors of the Three Heavens to dispatch the Envoys of Grand Unity to relieve people of ten sufferings.\n\nThe *Secret Words of the Eightfold Dao* states: The first, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh months are the nine fasting months of the Perfected; the first, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth days of each month are the three fasting days within the month. The first day of the first month is called the Heavenly *La*; the fifth day of the fifth month, the Earthly *La*; the seventh day of the seventh month, the *La* of Dao and Virtue; the first day of the tenth month, the *La* of the People’s Year; and the festival day of the twelfth month, the *La* of Lords and Kings. On these five *La* days, one should perform fasts and offer sacrifices to ancestors.\n\nThe *Luminous Perfection Regulations* states: The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of each month are the ten straight fasting days. On *Gengshen*, *Jiazi*, and the eight solar terms, the Eight Spirits of Grand Unity descend to examine people’s transgressions. Fasting brings joy to Grand Unity.\n\nOn *Gengshen* days, the concealed corpses within the human body ascend to Heaven to report sins; on one’s natal day, the divine officers and soldiers of the body’s gods ascend to Heaven to tally merits and transgressions.\n\nThe *Daoist Regulations for the Three Caverns* states: The first day of the first month is the Fast of Offering Longevity; the seventh day, the Fast of Extending the Spirits; the eighth day of the second month, the Fragrant Spring Fast; the eighth day of the fourth month, the Fast of Commencing Summer; the fifth day of the fifth month, the Fast of Continuing Life; the sixth day of the sixth month, the Fast of Clearing Summer Heat; the seventh day of the seventh month, the Fast of Welcoming Autumn; the first day of the eighth month, the Fast of Expelling Evil; the ninth day of the ninth month, the Fast of Extending Lifespan; the first day of the tenth month, the Fast of Completing Blessings; the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, the Fast of Initiating Blessings; the *La* day of the twelfth month, the Fast of a Hundred Blessings; and the twenty-eighth day, the Fast of Welcoming the New.\n\nThe *Li* of spring is the Fast of Establishing Goodness; the spring equinox, the Fast of Extending Blessings; the *Li* of summer, the Fast of Prolonging Goodness; the summer solstice, the Fast of Vermilion Brightness; the *Li* of autumn, the Fast of Distant Longevity; the autumn equinox, the Fast of Atoning for Sins; the *Li* of winter, the Fast of Following Goodness; and the winter solstice, the Fast of Broad Celebration. Each of these fasts has its own scriptural rites and forms. Thus, those who study the Dao yet do not observe fasting and precepts labor in vain in the mountains and forests.\n\nNow, the fast is fundamentally about purity, emptiness, tranquility, humility, reverence, trembling caution—as though treading on ice or a ravine, or standing before a stern lord—with sincere devotion and utmost modesty, earnestly seeking divine response. One must examine and restrain both inner and outer conduct, allowing no disorder or distraction.\n\nThose who perform fasts must strictly avoid those in mourning, newly delivered women, women during menstruation, and those suffering from malaria, sores, scabies, or other illnesses; none of these may ascend the fasting hall, courtyard, or altar, nor be employed as attendants. Those who desperately seek to join the fast or beg for absolution of transgressions may submit written petitions to confess and repent, but they may not enter the hall or temple precincts. For those performing ritual matters, arrange separate seating, and also avoid the presence of the six livestock. For such people defile the true spirits, and the worthies and sages will not descend—thus, the fast yields no merit.\n\nIn all cases, the host of the fast must be devout, and the officiating officials must be solemn. Even the lack of proper incense and lamps is considered negligence; in invoking the sages and praying to the Perfected, nothing takes precedence over these.\n\nIncense is most valued when made of aloeswood, sandalwood, or *chenxiang*. According to the *Shangqing* tradition, incense should be blended into pearl-like pellets, and musk from deer glands must not be used. To summon the Perfected and invoke the spirits, one must maintain utmost sincerity and focus. For impoverished Daoist practitioners living in seclusion who cannot afford these, even a small offering suffices as a token; one must not allow a complete absence. However, using only milk-based incense is not in accordance with Daoist practice.\n\nWhen first entering the fasting chamber, observe the direction in which the incense smoke rises: if it ascends straight toward the east, south, west, or north, the Five Emperors will arrive in accordance with its direction.\n\nThe *Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection* states: Incense is what the celestial Perfected use to establish communication, and what the earthly deities rely upon to convey sincerity. Whether in fasting, purification, prayer, or contemplation, one must burn incense on both sides, and the Golden Lads attending the incense will surely summon the Perfected and convey one’s intent.\n\nThe *Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection* states: The Perfected harness the radiance of the sun to illuminate, and command the essence of the moon to brighten the obscure. Thus, lighting the nine subtle lamps of ninefold light illumines the eight directions through the deepest night.\n\nThe *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles* states: At the *Li* of spring and the spring equinox, light nine lamps in the courtyard; at the *Li* of summer and the summer solstice, light eight lamps; at the *Li* of autumn and the autumn equinox, light six lamps; at the *Li* of winter and the winter solstice, light five lamps; on one’s natal day, light twelve lamps. From these, one may present petitions, atone for transgressions, and pray for blessings.",

      "translated_text": "The method of using lamps in the courtyard aligns with the practice of various fasts, each with its own prescribed number of lamps. Upon completion, face the directional sovereign according to the season, except on one’s natal day, when one faces the Year-Star. Knock the teeth twenty-four times and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Perfected, Myriad Sage Emperors, Jade Lords of the Five Thearchs, Overseers of All Immortals and Perfected: On this auspicious day of the eight solar nodes, I lay bare my yang transgressions and yin offenses, severing the Nine Yin’s bonds. From this day forth, may I be released from the Seven Darks, escape the Fiery Realm, and forever depart the Knife Mountains. May the Three Paths and Five Sufferings never burden my body. May I be as enduring as heaven and earth, ever safeguarded by the Celestial Dawn. May the Five Vows and Eight Assemblies all come to pass as spoken.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, remove the headscarf and bow one hundred and twenty times, pressing the forehead to the ground without causing pain. Upon finishing, replace the headscarf and look to the heavens, contemplating: *\"Today, my body offers reverence to the Celestial Grace, receiving the gift of restored form and the rebirth of a flying immortal.\"* Conclude by inhaling twenty-four breaths of qi, facing upward. After three years of this practice, all accumulated transgressions will be eradicated, and one’s body will become as the Perfected.\n\nAccording to the methods of fasting in the scriptures, there are roughly three kinds:\n1. **Offering Fasts**, which accumulate virtue and absolve transgressions.\n2. **Abstentional Fasts**, which harmonize the spirit and preserve longevity—these are the fasts of sacrificial rites, practiced by those of middling attainment.\n3. **Heart Fasts**, which entail purifying the heart, eliminating desires, cleansing the spirit, and shedding impurities; shattering worldly wisdom and severing discursive thought. Without thought or worry, one concentrates on the Dao; without craving or desire, one delights in the Dao; without impurity or burden, one unites with the Dao. As the heart holds no dualistic thoughts, it is called *\"single-mindedness\"*—this is the practice of the highest adepts, and it is most profound.\n\n*\"Fasting\"* (斋) means *\"to align\"* (齐): one must align and rectify the three karmic actions to truly fast. If one merely observes abstention from food while the heart and mind remain unaligned, or if one’s focus is solely on singular intent, then the mouth’s abstention from gluttony is but one aspect. The two methods—outer form and inner essence—mutually reinforce each other. Thus, the *Sutra of Great Precepts* states: *\"A level heart and tranquil silence, undivided focus; no indulgence after midday; inner and outer purity and emptiness.\"*\n\nThough I am but slightly versed in dietary restraint, I have yet to master the regulation of the heart. Hence, these fasting methods are taught to those receiving the Dao. Yet how many among the unlearned can truly empty their hearts and maintain singular intent? Those who dismiss the teachings of sacrificial rites, claiming to have grasped the principle of the Heart Fast, fall into the error of negligence. Though they speak of stillness, their eyes betray no understanding—this is but self-conceit. The *Book of Changes* says: *\"The sage uses this for fasting and vigil.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Fasting Regulations**\nThe Daoist Wang Can, a native of Jintan, dwelled on Mount Maji. He was ever devoted to secret acts of kindness, extending his benevolence even to the lowliest creatures. At the end of the Jin dynasty, when the Central Plains were ravaged by chaos, famine and pestilence struck in succession. Toxic miasmas claimed many lives, villages lay desolate, and the dead piled like kindling.\n\nIn his secluded chamber, Wang Can submitted a flying memorial to the Mysterious, weeping for three nights. On the third night, a light as bright as day illuminated his courtyard. Auspicious winds and rosy clouds swirled in the sky. Suddenly, the fragrance of rare incense and celestial music descended into his garden. Over thirty armored warriors, clad in metal and wielding weapons, arrayed themselves as if awaiting orders. Soon after, pearl-encrusted banners, jeweled canopies, rainbow streamers, and feathered standards—each borne by two attendants—preceded a procession. At the rear, four azure youths carried flowers and incense, while maidens bore trays. A brocade mat was spread upon the ground, before which stood a great screen. Flanking it were dragon and tiger generals, officers, and soldiers—some two thousand in all—standing in formation as if on guard.\n\nTwenty-six golden-armored generals and ten divine kings took their places beyond the dragon and tiger lords, their ranks impeccably ordered. In an instant, the air filled with the sound of flutes and pipes from the northwest, accompanied by radiant, multicolored blossoms. A figure, sword at his side and tablet in hand, approached Wang Can and announced: *\"The Most High Lord of the Dao has arrived.\"*\n\nThen, a throne of myriad treasures descended from the sky. The Most High Lord of the Dao, attended by two Perfected Ones and two Celestial Emperors, took his seat. The Lord sat upon a five-colored lotus, while the two Perfected and two Emperors stood in attendance. Wang Can bowed in reverence, prostrating himself upon the ground.\n\nThe Lord of the Dao spoke: *\"You, moved by compassion for the people, have expressed your intent through memorials and offerings, carving out your heart and shedding your blood. Your sincerity has stirred the unseen and the manifest; the Earth Bureau has recorded your name. The nurturing of all things relies upon the Five Phases, which interact through mutual conquest, each with its rise and fall. Their ceaseless alternation allows no respite, and thus life persists, qi succeeding qi across eons without pause. Those who attain life ascend as immortals, uniting with pure yang; those who meet death sink into the depths of yin, becoming ghosts upon the earth. Among ghostly beings, there are distinctions of superiority and inferiority, strength and weakness, firmness and gentleness, goodness and evil—no different from the mortal world.*\n\n*The Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Honored One, fearing the wanton harm inflicted by ghosts and spirits upon humanity, has commanded the Five Emperors and the Three Officials to enforce the laws, statutes, and penal codes governing their regulation—all of which are clear and comprehensive. Yet in this degenerate age, the people are steeped in deceit, their pure origins scattered. Heresy and treachery arise, loyalty to rulers and filial piety to families decay. The teachings of the Three Bonds and Five Constants are abandoned, and the people cast themselves into the realm of death. Thus, the stale qi of the Six Heavens and the legions of demonic ghosts, along with the defeated armies and slain generals of past ages, band together to assail the living. They ride the winds and rains, seizing opportunities in times of weakness to inflict myriad illnesses, causing great harm. Some, robbed of their allotted years, meet untimely ends. For this reason, the *Divine Incantation Sutra* was revealed in the Duyang Palace and bestowed upon the Perfected Tang Ping, to be disseminated for the salvation of all beings. It now exists among the people.\"*",

After eating, he expounded the Dharma, telling the laborer: 'By keeping this fast with me today, your merit is vast. Return tomorrow at midday to eat again, but do not break your fast—lest your efforts be in vain. Should you persist, you may escape worldly calamities in this very life.'\n\nThe man bowed deeply, received the precepts, and departed.

Later, when his life ended, heavenly decree made him the spirit of a thousand-year-old tree on Mount Shu, where he was regularly provided with midday sustenance, causing the tree to flourish. During the scorching summer months, three diligent and virtuous men passed by and rested beneath its shade. One of them sighed, saying: \"Though this tree offers coolness, the sun has already reached midday—how shall we find food?\" The tree spirit replied: \"I shall prepare a midday meal for you, noble ones; have no concern.\" Soon, food arrived, and the virtuous men partook together. After eating, they said: \"We seek the Dao—where may it be found? This occurrence is not of the Dao.\" They then asked the tree: \"Might the great spirit briefly descend in form to meet with us?\" The tree spirit answered from the void: \"I am no one who can guide others to the Dao. Recall my name and dwelling place: once, I served a Daoist and was urged to observe a fast, but my wife caused me to break it. My merit incomplete, I was condemned to guard this tree spirit, unable to escape. Heaven, remembering my past midday fasts, now provides me with sustenance at this hour. Yet my mouth is too occupied to eat, and I have no means to advance. I humbly ask, noble ones, to visit my home and explain my plight. If you would observe a three-day fast and precepts on my behalf, I may ascend to heaven.\" Moved by his plea, the virtuous men sought his household and recounted his words. His family then prepared a fast, inviting Daoists to burn incense, recite scriptures, and perform rites of repentance for three days. Thereupon, the spirit soared into the clouds, ascending to the Radiant Empyrean, where he received the register of a wandering immortal.\n\nThus, the merit of fasting is profound and must not be neglected. This man observed but half a day’s fast, yet upon his death the very next day, he was reborn and, within a year, attained immortality. Heaven’s reckoning of merit and transgression is never unjust. Those who cultivate the Dao must diligently observe fasts and precepts, awaiting the unseen response. Whoever perseveres in this practice shall surely attain the ascent to transcendence.\n\n**Miscellaneous Fasting Days and the Three Assemblies**\nThe *Three Assemblies* states:",

Return tomorrow at midday to eat again, but do not break your fast—lest your efforts be in vain. Should you persist, you may escape worldly calamities in this very life.'\n\nThe man bowed deeply, received the precepts, and departed. That evening, upon returning home, his wife had awaited her husband all day. He recounted the Daoist’s admonitions to her.\"",
