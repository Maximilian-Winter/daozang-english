  "full_translation": "**The Jade Instructions of the Imperial Chapter of the *Luminous Writ of the Great Empyrean***\n\n**Text Title:** *The Jade Instructions of the Imperial Chapter of the Luminous Writ of the Great Empyrean*\n*Author unknown, approximately dated to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Largely identical to the fifth scroll of the* Supreme Cavern Perfection’s *Luminous Writ of the Great Empyrean*. *Source text:* *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity* (Washing Realization Division, Jade Instructions Category).\n\n---\n\n### **On the Transmission Between Master and Disciple**\n\n#### **Copying the Scriptures and Their Instructions**\nOnce the scriptures are obtained, they must be recopied. The original serves as the permanent repository, while the copies are for veneration alone.\n\nFor the present transcription, meticulous collation is required. Those of ample means and resources should produce three copies: one for permanent preservation, one for ritual offerings, and one for study. The copy for study should always accompany the practitioner in their dwelling, placed upon a separate stand. It must be personally handled in and out, never entrusted to others. Only family members or disciples of shared *qi* and sincere devotion may assist, though full delegation is forbidden. Should negligence arise from carelessness, or if the learner’s understanding remains shallow and their practice flawed, violations of prohibitions may bring misfortune to both parties. Clarity, caution, and vigilance invite fortune and avert calamity.\n\nWhen copying the scriptures, one must observe a pure fast. The proper method is to transcribe them by hand, exchanging the text with one’s master. If one is occupied with duties at the gate or other杂役, leaving no time for personal transcription, or if one is unskilled in brushwork or slow and imprecise, the wealthy may hire a scribe with gold or silk, while the poor may employ a laborer, pooling wages to secure a masterful hand. Carelessness must not be tolerated.\n\nErrors in text or distortions in illustrations incur examination and punishment. How can blessings be attained? The scriptures contain diagrams, which may be bound separately. Each has its attendant officials—custodians of the true diagrams, jade lads and jade maidens—treated with the same reverence as the scriptures themselves. One must not evade difficulty by omitting diagrams while transcribing the text.\n\nMistakes may be corrected by washing, but no more than three corrections per sheet of paper or silk. Exceeding three requires replacement, and the flawed sheet is purified by fire. Trim the edges of stained sections, attach the scroll’s head and axle with ribbons, and wrap it in a cloth case, securing it in a sturdy box. The vessel should be complete and clean, without excess ornamentation.\n\nWorldly teachings transform the world by forsaking extravagance. If extravagance cannot yet be abandoned, its use is temporarily permitted. Thus, worldly people are guided to reduce vulgar opulence. When opulence is offered to the Dharma, they gradually recognize the value of simplicity. Once simplicity is attained, extravagance naturally fades, neither sought nor contrived. It arises spontaneously, and none can prevent it. This is the fruit of simplicity—do not remain mired in worldly extravagance.\n\nThe furnishings of altars and traveling cases may vary in abundance or modesty, but they must suit one’s wealth or poverty. Neither should the rich feign austerity nor the poor force extravagance. Excessive splendor or stingy frugality both deviate from the Dao’s regulations. The Dao’s regulations value moderation, harmonizing inner and outer.\n\nIf the scriptures are lost or damaged through negligence, one must confess the fault, observe a pure fast, and perform repentance rites according to the statutes of the *Supreme Perfection*. For long-term damage or alterations, follow the methods prescribed in the *Supreme Perfection*.\n\nIncense, lamps, and prostrations must be performed with utmost reverence. Precision ensures sagehood, merging with the true Dao.\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions for Petitioning**\n\nWhen a disciple, by karmic affinity, seeks the Dharma from a master, the transmission should begin with copying the scriptures. Once the transcription and diagrams are complete, an auspicious day is chosen for the fast. During the fast, a petition is presented, generally as follows:\n\nThough the methods of fasting are many, they all conform to the Three Primes. The fasts of the Three Primes encompass all other methods. The transmission of superior scriptures employs the Upper Prime. The content of the petition may vary with circumstances, but adjustments should be concise and not overly elaborate.\n\nFor all fasts and petitions, the memorial must first be prepared. Carelessness and haste are forbidden, lest one offend the true.\n\n**Proper Form for the Memorial:**\nBegin with the reign title of the state, the year (with its *Tai Sui* designation), the month, the day of the new moon, the hour, the prefecture, commandery, county, village, and hamlet. Then state the rank, name, and titles of the petitioner—whether male or female official, libationer, Daoist master, perfected one, *Yuanjun*, or lady. Specify the location of the petition: the prefecture, commandery, county, village, hamlet, mountain abode, or temple where the ritual is held. Address the recipient: the male or female Daoist, Dharma master, and their name. Declare the reception of the *Great Cavern Perfection Scriptures*, listing them as follows:\n\n*Cavern Perfection Division*, Scroll [number]. List them in order. If all have been obtained, follow the sequence to the end. If only partial texts are received, do not list them collectively; instead, enumerate them individually without specifying scroll numbers. Simply state the titles and quantities, itemizing them one by one.\n\n**Example:**\nThe above [number] scrolls are now presented for transmission during this fast. Respectfully submitted.\n\n[Petitioner’s] prefecture, commandery, county, village, hamlet, rank, and name state: By fortunate karmic affinity, I have annually revered the mysterious ultimate. Having received these treasured texts, I am both awed and humbled. My life is fleeting, yet I aspire to longevity. Greedy for advancement and heedless of retreat, I have encountered this auspicious occasion. I humbly request the transmission of the aforementioned [number] scrolls. In accordance with the statutes, I offer [number] types of Dharma tokens. This petition is respectfully presented. I pray that my master will grant permission. I vow to cultivate the Way with devotion and never betray my master’s teachings. Should I violate this oath, may I be severed by the wind’s blade, accepting my fate without resentment. All follows the luminous statutes. Respectfully submitted.\n\n*Tai Sui* [designation], [month, day, hour], at [mountain abode].\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions for Transmitting Taboo Names**\n\nWhen transmitting the scriptural treasures, it is essential to honor one’s master. Record the master’s master, and the master of the master’s master—three generations of lineage. Note their places of residence, ranks, names, courtesy names, ages, locations of transmission, and the disciples to whom they were passed. Inscribe these on yellow silk, carry them at all times, and never lose them. Loss incurs penalties as prescribed in the *Supreme Perfection* statutes.\n\nIf one does not carry them constantly, they may be stored within the scriptures, wrapped separately in a cloth case. Invoke the *Perfected Master*, the *Master’s Master*, the *Mysterious Master*, the *Master of the Azure Lad*, and the *Great Lord*, as well as the *Lesser Lord*. Venerate these two lords with proper rites.\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions for Dharma Tokens**\n\nThe statutes for Dharma tokens differ from those for scriptures. Each master’s oral instructions have their own karmic causes. As statutes and circumstances evolve, variations arise—do not doubt them. Follow the master’s guidance. Without a master, petition the mysterious according to the proper form, offering tokens as prescribed. No deviations are permitted.\n\nEach scroll is transmitted separately, each statute passed down in succession. Scriptures and statutes are cross-referenced, while master and disciple weigh their measure. Though light may be exchanged for heavy, and ease may dispel difficulty, one must carefully consider the proper form of offerings, ensuring no deviation from the prescribed method—only then can the karmic causes bear fruit.\n\nFor those receiving the transmission all at once, the required items are as follows:\n\n1. Nine taels of superior gold;\n2. One hundred twenty feet of purple brocade;\n3. Forty feet each of five-colored patterned silk;\n4. One thousand two hundred feet of white silk;\n5. Twenty-four zhang of purple-patterned silk;\n6. Life-bestowing colored silks, with patterns and lengths corresponding to the recipient’s cyclical signs and years;\n7. Three catties each of five-colored threads;\n8. Nine catties each of five varieties of incense;\n9. Three jade dragons and three jade fish;\n10. Five gold dragons and five gold fish;\n11. One jade wild goose and one jade ram;\n12. One gold wild goose and one gold ram;\n13. Three jade tablets;\n14. Nine pairs each of gold and silver rings;\n15. Three hundred sixty pearls, each the size of a firmiana seed;\n16. Five-colored threads, each in quantities corresponding to their directional weights;\n17. Three hundred sixty sheets of large-sized paper;\n18. Five pairs of brushes;\n19. Five dragon-headed writing knives;\n20. One purple canopy with a red wrapping, accompanied by two sets of vermilion-dyed headbands and gold-silver implements;\n21. Five blue canopies with jade-green wrappings, accompanied by three sets of black-dyed headbands and ivory-bronze implements;\n22. One bright mirror, no less than one foot in diameter (or at minimum nine inches);\n23. One set of Dharma robes, cap, shoes, and hand tablet—moderate in quality, new, clean, fragrant, and pure;\n24. One pure jar and one tray, made of gold, silver, bronze, or pottery, as circumstances allow.\n\nThe above twenty-four items are required for the transmission of scriptures and Dharma tokens. Each serves a specific purpose; gather and prepare them without omission. In remote regions, substitute items of equivalent value may be used, but ensure they align in kind and intent. If any item is unavailable, note its absence and make it up after the transmission. At the outset of the purification fast and the presentation of the petition, these offerings must be prepared. Consult the master, record what is present or lacking, and affix this inventory after the scripture’s table of contents but before the petition text. Read it aloud at the beginning of the invocation, and again when submitting the memorial during the transmission ritual—take care not to overlook this.\n\nWhen the master receives these tokens, they must be used in strict accordance with the statutes, ensuring proper application for mutual protection and the attainment of perfection. If entering a mysterious covenant, follow this same method. After consulting the *Golden Writ*, observe the rites for dispersing offerings—but if the scriptures are not fully prepared, do not employ this method.\n\nThose of lofty aspiration must meticulously adhere to these instructions.\n\n### **The Nine Statutes of Supreme Perfection**\n\nThe Supreme Perfected Lord of the Great Dao established these statutes to perfect the various methods, dispersing them throughout the scriptures—sometimes preceding, sometimes following—so that readers may not distinguish them. One should seek the original text.\n\nThe original text spans three scrolls, a secret transmission from the master. Those who receive it study it in seclusion and become teachers of heaven and humanity. Here, the essentials are summarized in nine statutes, which the Perfected of the Nine Heavens all observe. To teach without them invites error in both action and stillness.\n\nIf a wise and discerning person seeks to receive the precious scriptures, the master must first instruct them in the essential precepts. The proper method of transmission follows these nine statutes; by analogy, nothing is left unaddressed. Unless one embodies the true Dao, do not presumptuously add or omit. All scriptures of the Three Caverns adhere to this standard.\n\nThe Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Lord of Western Citadel, the Immortal Lords, Ministers, and those of high talent and great virtue all treasure and guard these secrets—take care not to leak them.\n\n**First Statute: After the fast concludes, transmit the precepts; after the precepts are transmitted, proceed with the scriptures according to the rites. The year of transmission sets the term limit.**\n\nThe limit restrains the mind; the term reveals the Dao. The Dao is the master of all wonders, and to observe its wonders, one must behold its origin. Eliminating desire is paramount; reducing desire is secondary. Depth and shallowness follow one’s capacity; excellence and inferiority depend on virtue.\n\nThe measure of virtue is boundless, but its major divisions number six:\n1. Four myriad kalpas;\n2. Four myriad years;\n3. Four thousand years;\n4. Four hundred years;\n5. Forty years;\n6. Exactly four cycles.\n\nUpon completing the cycle or kalpa, one may transmit to another. After nine transmissions, the honor of the enlightened Dao and the nobility of virtue are manifest. In times of urgency, when the era is pressing, great compassion seeks to save widely—thus, upon encountering a worthy recipient, transmission proceeds without rigid adherence to numbers. However, the initial reception must be modest, with verification sought within the term.\n\nIf, during the foundational period, one encounters peril or is threatened by misfortune, and wisdom and strength cannot transform the situation, yield and comply to avoid calamity. The essence of what is received resides in the heart, not stagnating in scrolls, lest it harm the mysterious and true. If coerced by power and forced to betray one’s original master, but one judges that afterward they can subdue the oppressor and preserve their initial resolve, they may temporarily comply with the oppressor’s demands. If unable to do so, sever ties even at the cost of life—take care not to dishonor the original master or abandon the true Dao.\n\nIf one’s wisdom and strength are insufficient, do not rashly claim the ability to subdue the oppressor. Failing to assess virtue and overestimating one’s power leads to the destruction of body and life, with no success—only added sin. One should reflect deeply.\n\nIf the scriptures are lost unexpectedly, without one’s awareness, or seized by bandits with uncertain survival, one must undertake a prolonged fast of repentance, offering body, life, and wealth. Relying on the master for years, one exhausts all sincerity, harboring no resentment or complaint, before receiving them anew. If the scriptures are lost three times, do not hastily receive them again. Instead, intensify repentance until spiritual resonance occurs, then receive them once more—this ensures attainment of the Dao and perfection. To receive without resonance is futile, and the transmission will yield no fruition, becoming a cause for future consequences. It is better to receive the superior than the inferior.\n\nReceiving without cease alters the heart and spirit. Though initially no attainment may seem apparent, ultimately one will achieve the Dao.\n\n**Second Precept:** After receiving the scriptures, diligently follow the master’s teachings, concealing one’s inner radiance without flaunting it. Only upon completing the prescribed term may one transmit them to the worthy. The worthy are not easily found—do not recklessly transmit to the unworthy, lest the \"wind-knife\" of mutual harm extend upward to one’s ancestors and downward to one’s descendants, deepening evil and severing one’s lineage, consigning one eternally to the ranks of hungry ghosts.\n\nIf within the term one encounters disasters—such as family bereavement, public or private strife, bloodshed, imprisonment, fire, flood, theft, or grave illness—even if the term has expired, one must not transmit the scriptures to others. Instead, one should repent of one’s offenses, diligently cultivate merit, and petition the Three Treasures for timely deliverance before any transmission may occur. If one enjoys longevity, ascends through karmic fortune, or suffers unjust imprisonment without fault, these pose no obstacle, and transmission may proceed as scheduled.\n\n**Third Precept:** Let faith be pure and the heart steadfast, illuminating the wondrous meaning. Ensure the scriptures are of fine quality, obtained through proper means. Prepare the necessary provisions, accumulate resources in secret, and refrain from boastful talk or stinginess. Beware of seeking them through deceit, coercion, or theft, or claiming stolen gains as merit—such acts invite further retribution and preclude blessings.\n\nWhen the master transmits them, divide the offerings into three parts: one for the disciple to sponsor rituals, aiding in the provision of incense, oil, and scriptures; one to relieve the hardships of mountain recluses; and one to supply the master’s robes and sustenance, as well as offerings to the Three Treasures. Do not disperse them privately. Distribution must follow the Dharma, without miserliness. Hoarding invites calamity, harms the Dao, disgraces the Dharma, and invites scorn from humans and spirits.\n\nIn times of urgency, prioritize aid as needed, but first invoke the Three Treasures before allocating resources. Violations incur divine scrutiny, and theft is judged by the law. For those sharing the same altar in the Numinous Treasure tradition, adhere to the Twelve Precepts.\n\n**Fourth Precept:** After receiving the scriptures, uphold the rites without fail. If illness, unforeseen events, or public or private affairs prevent observance, make amends afterward with repentance, remorse, and a sincere cleansing of the heart. If one wanders in dissipation, indulges in pleasure, or grows arrogant and negligent, such transgressions will consign one eternally to Fengdu.\n\n**Fifth Precept:** The Dharma requires perpetual fasting. For those unable, choose auspicious occasions to express sincerity—six months of the year, ten auspicious days each month. If even this is unfeasible, observe the new moon, half-moon, and dark moon, the four seasons, the eight solar terms, and one’s birthdays. Do not entirely neglect these practices, for neglect yields no merit. Forsaking the Dao and abandoning the Dharma invites misfortune. If one inadvertently breaks the fast, repent immediately. Repeated violations without remorse lead to demonic possession.\n\nCultivate the Dao without slackening, without regression. Uphold the Dao and propagate the Dharma, harmonizing self and others. Attainment of sagehood is assured, and one will be honored with the title of \"Mysterious Virtue.\"\n\n**Fasting Months:** The first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months of the year—six months in total, all odd-numbered, aligning with the flourishing of yang and the establishment of yin’s merit.\n\n**Auspicious Days Each Month:** The ten celestial stems—days 1, 8, 14, 15, 18, 23, 24, 28, 29, and 30.\n\n**Sixth Precept:** Study and recite the scriptures and precepts, expound and clarify their meaning, and daily seek profound understanding. Apply what you comprehend—do not violate it. If you transgress, repent immediately and do not repeat the offense. Meditate on the texts while sitting or walking, and do not neglect or forget them.\n\nIf you conceal your knowledge, deceive others, disregard the consequences of success or failure, grow lazy in answering questions, resent inquiries, or envy the accomplished; if you speak carelessly, employ deceptive words, feign understanding, mislead others with false interpretations, distort passages, alter or embellish chapters, fabricate heretical doctrines, or deviate from the truth—all such acts invite grave misfortune.\n\n**Seventh Precept:** Propagate the scriptures and precepts, establish virtue and merit, aid others to perfect oneself, and prioritize conversion. Uphold righteousness and enlightenment without pretense. Employ skillful means for benefit, but do not act lightly if your wisdom is shallow, lest you stray into falsehood.\n\nAdhere to the true intent, guiding like-minded individuals to the master’s gate. Study the scriptures and precepts together, verify the wondrous principles, and inspire virtuous hearts. Invite them to participate in fasts and rituals, allowing them to witness the blessings of the Dharma. Foster joy and harmony, achieving success without reproach or anger, which only exacerbate faults.\n\nUse parables to guide, not force. Exercise care and moderation, balancing firmness and gentleness. Grant and withhold as needed, nurturing in myriad ways. If one remains obstinate, pity them without abandoning them. Cultivate boundless compassion, never forsaking others. With a virtuous teacher, vow to ascend together. Honor the master and cherish the teachings, fulfilling the fruition of the supreme truth.\n\n**Eighth Precept:** The master should pity disciples with impartiality, without favoritism. Rewards and punishments must be clear: punishment to curb evil, reward to encourage virtue. Not even the slightest detail should be overlooked, nor the tiniest fault misjudged. Misjudgment or bias invites calamity, subjecting one to severe divine scrutiny in both the unseen and manifest realms.\n\n**Ninth Precept:** Disciples must serve the master with reverence and single-mindedness, moving little and speaking sparingly, cultivating solemnity and tranquility. Attend to the master’s countenance, seek the wondrous instructions, and strive to contribute merit to the Three Treasures. Devote yourself wholeheartedly, obeying commands without hesitation, undeterred by water or fire, distance or proximity. If in doubt, seek clarification; if permitted to correct, do so. If not, comply without evasion.\n\nThe master tests disciples to strengthen their resolve, guiding them to enter the Dao and attain the truth, discerning their progress. Daily, the master assigns tasks, urging ever greater diligence to fulfill the supreme Way.\n\nIf the master’s spiritual power is weak, do not recklessly test others. A sagely and enlightened master’s tests incur no harm. Fortune and misfortune, adversity and favor—all depend on the enlightened master. If one encounters an unworthy master, the Dharma does not abhor evil; evil is self-invited. Even in death, one may not complain but must reflect on one’s own faults and reform for the future.\n\nShould hesitation or doubt toward the master arise, one ought not serve them. If serving, comply in all things; no defiance may be shown. Defiance leads to loss of the Way, forever mired in suffering and ruin.\n\nEach must be vigilant at the outset, striving to persevere to the end.\n\nThe Nine Sections above—these essentials were expounded by the Perfected of the Nine Palaces. All the boundless hosts of great sages who have attained the Way in the ten directions alike observe and practice them, delivering and guiding all beings.\n\nHere ends the *Jade Instructions of the Imperial Chapter from the Numinous Writ of the Great Empyrean*.",

Respectfully submitted.\n\n*Tai Sui* [designation], [month, day, hour], at [mountain abode].\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions for Transmitting Taboo Names**\n\nWhen transmitting the scriptural treasures, it is essential to honor one’s master. Record the master’s master, and the master of the master’s master—three generations of lineage. Note their places of residence, ranks, names, courtesy names, ages, locations of transmission, and the disciples to whom they were passed. Inscribe these on yellow silk, carry them at all times, and never lose them. Loss incurs penalties as prescribed in the *Supreme Perfection* statutes.\n\nIf one does not carry them constantly, they may be stored within the scriptures, wrapped separately in a cloth case. Invoke the *Perfected Master*, the *Master’s Master*, the *Mysterious Master*, the *Master of the Azure Lad*, and the *Great Lord*, as well as the *Lesser Lord*. Venerate these two lords with proper rites.\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions for Dharma Tokens**\n\nThe statutes for Dharma tokens differ from those for scriptures. Each master’s oral instructions have their own karmic causes. As statutes and circumstances evolve, variations arise—do not doubt them. Follow the master’s guidance. Without a master, petition the mysterious according to the proper form, offering tokens as prescribed. No deviations are permitted.",

      "translated_text": "Each scroll is transmitted separately, each statute passed down in succession. Scriptures and statutes are cross-referenced, while master and disciple weigh their measure. Though light may be exchanged for heavy, and ease may dispel difficulty, one must carefully consider the proper form of offerings, ensuring no deviation from the prescribed method—only then can the karmic causes bear fruit.\n\nFor those receiving the transmission all at once, the required items are as follows:\n\n1. Nine taels of superior gold;\n2. One hundred twenty feet of purple brocade;\n3. Forty feet each of five-colored patterned silk;\n4. One thousand two hundred feet of white silk;\n5. Twenty-four zhang of purple-patterned silk;\n6. Life-bestowing colored silks, with patterns and lengths corresponding to the recipient’s cyclical signs and years;\n7. Three catties each of five-colored threads;\n8. Nine catties each of five varieties of incense;\n9. Three jade dragons and three jade fish;\n10. Five gold dragons and five gold fish;\n11. One jade wild goose and one jade ram;\n12. One gold wild goose and one gold ram;\n13. Three jade tablets;\n14. Nine pairs each of gold and silver rings;\n15. Three hundred sixty pearls, each the size of a firmiana seed;\n16. Five-colored threads, each in quantities corresponding to their directional weights;\n17. Three hundred sixty sheets of large-sized paper;\n18. Five pairs of brushes;\n19. Five dragon-headed writing knives;\n20. One purple canopy with a red wrapping, accompanied by two sets of vermilion-dyed headbands and gold-silver implements;\n21. Five blue canopies with jade-green wrappings, accompanied by three sets of black-dyed headbands and ivory-bronze implements;\n22. One bright mirror, no less than one foot in diameter (or at minimum nine inches);\n23. One set of Dharma robes, cap, shoes, and hand tablet—moderate in quality, new, clean, fragrant, and pure;\n24. One pure jar and one tray, made of gold, silver, bronze, or pottery, as circumstances allow.\n\nThe above twenty-four items are required for the transmission of scriptures and Dharma tokens. Each serves a specific purpose; gather and prepare them without omission. In remote regions, substitute items of equivalent value may be used, but ensure they align in kind and intent. If any item is unavailable, note its absence and make it up after the transmission. At the outset of the purification fast and the presentation of the petition, these offerings must be prepared. Consult the master, record what is present or lacking, and affix this inventory after the scripture’s table of contents but before the petition text. Read it aloud at the beginning of the invocation, and again when submitting the memorial during the transmission ritual—take care not to overlook this.\n\nWhen the master receives these tokens, they must be used in strict accordance with the statutes, ensuring proper application for mutual protection and the attainment of perfection. If entering a mysterious covenant, follow this same method. After consulting the *Golden Writ*, observe the rites for dispersing offerings—but if the scriptures are not fully prepared, do not employ this method.\n\nThose of lofty aspiration must meticulously adhere to these instructions.\n\n### **The Nine Statutes of Supreme Perfection**\n\nThe Supreme Perfected Lord of the Great Dao established these statutes to perfect the various methods, dispersing them throughout the scriptures—sometimes preceding, sometimes following—so that readers may not distinguish them. One should seek the original text.\n\nThe original text spans three scrolls, a secret transmission from the master. Those who receive it study it in seclusion and become teachers of heaven and humanity. Here, the essentials are summarized in nine statutes, which the Perfected of the Nine Heavens all observe. To teach without them invites error in both action and stillness.\n\nIf a wise and discerning person seeks to receive the precious scriptures, the master must first instruct them in the essential precepts. The proper method of transmission follows these nine statutes; by analogy, nothing is left unaddressed. Unless one embodies the true Dao, do not presumptuously add or omit. All scriptures of the Three Caverns adhere to this standard.\n\nThe Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Lord of Western Citadel, the Immortal Lords, Ministers, and those of high talent and great virtue all treasure and guard these secrets—take care not to leak them.\n\n**First Statute: After the fast concludes, transmit the precepts; after the precepts are transmitted, proceed with the scriptures according to the rites. The year of transmission sets the term limit.**\n\nThe limit restrains the mind; the term reveals the Dao. The Dao is the master of all wonders, and to observe its wonders, one must behold its origin. Eliminating desire is paramount; reducing desire is secondary. Depth and shallowness follow one’s capacity; excellence and inferiority depend on virtue.\n\nThe measure of virtue is boundless, but its major divisions number six:\n1. Four myriad kalpas;\n2. Four myriad years;\n3. Four thousand years;\n4. Four hundred years;\n5. Forty years;\n6. Exactly four cycles.\n\nUpon completing the cycle or kalpa, one may transmit to another. After nine transmissions, the honor of the enlightened Dao and the nobility of virtue are manifest. In times of urgency, when the era is pressing, great compassion seeks to save widely—thus, upon encountering a worthy recipient, transmission proceeds without rigid adherence to numbers. However, the initial reception must be modest, with verification sought within the term.\n\nIf, during the foundational period, one encounters peril or is threatened by misfortune, and wisdom and strength cannot transform the situation, yield and comply to avoid calamity. The essence of what is received resides in the heart, not stagnating in scrolls, lest it harm the mysterious and true. If coerced by power and forced to betray one’s original master, but one judges that afterward they can subdue the oppressor and preserve their initial resolve, they may temporarily comply with the oppressor’s demands. If unable to do so, sever ties even at the cost of life—take care not to dishonor the original master or abandon the true Dao.\n\nIf one’s wisdom and strength are insufficient, do not rashly claim the ability to subdue the oppressor. Failing to assess virtue and overestimating one’s power leads to the destruction of body and life, with no success—only added sin. One should reflect deeply.\n\nIf the scriptures are lost unexpectedly, without one’s awareness, or seized by bandits with uncertain survival, one must undertake a prolonged fast of repentance, offering body, life, and wealth. Relying on the master for years, one exhausts all sincerity, harboring no resentment or complaint, before receiving them anew. If the scriptures are lost three times, do not hastily receive them again. Instead, intensify repentance until spiritual resonance occurs, then receive them once more—this ensures attainment of the Dao and perfection. To receive without resonance is futile, and the transmission will yield no fruition, becoming a cause for future consequences. It is better to receive the superior than the inferior.\n\nReceiving without cease alters the heart and spirit. Though initially no attainment may seem apparent, ultimately one will achieve the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "**Second Precept:** After receiving the scriptures, diligently follow the master’s teachings, concealing one’s inner radiance without flaunting it. Only upon completing the prescribed term may one transmit them to the worthy. The worthy are not easily found—do not recklessly transmit to the unworthy, lest the \"wind-knife\" of mutual harm extend upward to one’s ancestors and downward to one’s descendants, deepening evil and severing one’s lineage, consigning one eternally to the ranks of hungry ghosts.\n\nIf within the term one encounters disasters—such as family bereavement, public or private strife, bloodshed, imprisonment, fire, flood, theft, or grave illness—even if the term has expired, one must not transmit the scriptures to others. Instead, one should repent of one’s offenses, diligently cultivate merit, and petition the Three Treasures for timely deliverance before any transmission may occur. If one enjoys longevity, ascends through karmic fortune, or suffers unjust imprisonment without fault, these pose no obstacle, and transmission may proceed as scheduled.\n\n**Third Precept:** Let faith be pure and the heart steadfast, illuminating the wondrous meaning. Ensure the scriptures are of fine quality, obtained through proper means. Prepare the necessary provisions, accumulate resources in secret, and refrain from boastful talk or stinginess. Beware of seeking them through deceit, coercion, or theft, or claiming stolen gains as merit—such acts invite further retribution and preclude blessings.\n\nWhen the master transmits them, divide the offerings into three parts: one for the disciple to sponsor rituals, aiding in the provision of incense, oil, and scriptures; one to relieve the hardships of mountain recluses; and one to supply the master’s robes and sustenance, as well as offerings to the Three Treasures. Do not disperse them privately. Distribution must follow the Dharma, without miserliness. Hoarding invites calamity, harms the Dao, disgraces the Dharma, and invites scorn from humans and spirits.\n\nIn times of urgency, prioritize aid as needed, but first invoke the Three Treasures before allocating resources. Violations incur divine scrutiny, and theft is judged by the law. For those sharing the same altar in the Numinous Treasure tradition, adhere to the Twelve Precepts.\n\n**Fourth Precept:** After receiving the scriptures, uphold the rites without fail. If illness, unforeseen events, or public or private affairs prevent observance, make amends afterward with repentance, remorse, and a sincere cleansing of the heart. If one wanders in dissipation, indulges in pleasure, or grows arrogant and negligent, such transgressions will consign one eternally to Fengdu.\n\n**Fifth Precept:** The Dharma requires perpetual fasting. For those unable, choose auspicious occasions to express sincerity—six months of the year, ten auspicious days each month. If even this is unfeasible, observe the new moon, half-moon, and dark moon, the four seasons, the eight solar terms, and one’s birthdays. Do not entirely neglect these practices, for neglect yields no merit. Forsaking the Dao and abandoning the Dharma invites misfortune. If one inadvertently breaks the fast, repent immediately. Repeated violations without remorse lead to demonic possession.\n\nCultivate the Dao without slackening, without regression. Uphold the Dao and propagate the Dharma, harmonizing self and others. Attainment of sagehood is assured, and one will be honored with the title of \"Mysterious Virtue.\"\n\n**Fasting Months:** The first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months of the year—six months in total, all odd-numbered, aligning with the flourishing of yang and the establishment of yin’s merit.\n\n**Auspicious Days Each Month:** The ten celestial stems—days 1, 8, 14, 15, 18, 23, 24, 28, 29, and 30.\n\n**Sixth Precept:** Study and recite the scriptures and precepts, expound and clarify their meaning, and daily seek profound understanding. Apply what you comprehend—do not violate it. If you transgress, repent immediately and do not repeat the offense. Meditate on the texts while sitting or walking, and do not neglect or forget them.\n\nIf you conceal your knowledge, deceive others, disregard the consequences of success or failure, grow lazy in answering questions, resent inquiries, or envy the accomplished; if you speak carelessly, employ deceptive words, feign understanding, mislead others with false interpretations, distort passages, alter or embellish chapters, fabricate heretical doctrines, or deviate from the truth—all such acts invite grave misfortune.\n\n**Seventh Precept:** Propagate the scriptures and precepts, establish virtue and merit, aid others to perfect oneself, and prioritize conversion. Uphold righteousness and enlightenment without pretense. Employ skillful means for benefit, but do not act lightly if your wisdom is shallow, lest you stray into falsehood.\n\nAdhere to the true intent, guiding like-minded individuals to the master’s gate. Study the scriptures and precepts together, verify the wondrous principles, and inspire virtuous hearts. Invite them to participate in fasts and rituals, allowing them to witness the blessings of the Dharma. Foster joy and harmony, achieving success without reproach or anger, which only exacerbate faults.\n\nUse parables to guide, not force. Exercise care and moderation, balancing firmness and gentleness. Grant and withhold as needed, nurturing in myriad ways. If one remains obstinate, pity them without abandoning them. Cultivate boundless compassion, never forsaking others. With a virtuous teacher, vow to ascend together. Honor the master and cherish the teachings, fulfilling the fruition of the supreme truth.\n\n**Eighth Precept:** The master should pity disciples with impartiality, without favoritism. Rewards and punishments must be clear: punishment to curb evil, reward to encourage virtue. Not even the slightest detail should be overlooked, nor the tiniest fault misjudged. Misjudgment or bias invites calamity, subjecting one to severe divine scrutiny in both the unseen and manifest realms.\n\n**Ninth Precept:** Disciples must serve the master with reverence and single-mindedness, moving little and speaking sparingly, cultivating solemnity and tranquility. Attend to the master’s countenance, seek the wondrous instructions, and strive to contribute merit to the Three Treasures. Devote yourself wholeheartedly, obeying commands without hesitation, undeterred by water or fire, distance or proximity. If in doubt, seek clarification; if permitted to correct, do so. If not, comply without evasion.\n\nThe master tests disciples to strengthen their resolve, guiding them to enter the Dao and attain the truth, discerning their progress. Daily, the master assigns tasks, urging ever greater diligence to fulfill the supreme Way.\n\nIf the master’s spiritual power is weak, do not recklessly test others. A sagely and enlightened master’s tests incur no harm. Fortune and misfortune, adversity and favor—all depend on the enlightened master. If one encounters an unworthy master, the Dharma does not abhor evil; evil is self-invited. Even in death, one may not complain but must reflect on one’s own faults and reform for the future.",
