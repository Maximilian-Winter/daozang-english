When the immortal of Mount Taibai (太白) revealed his transcendent bones, none would have recognized him as an extraordinary man had not Sima Ziwei (司马子微) discerned his true nature.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao conceal themselves in cliffs and valleys, dwelling in thatched huts, clad in coarse robes while harboring jade-like virtue. Though they possess talents vast as the warp and weft of the cosmos, they are not employed by the world, content to perfect themselves in tranquility. Yet after a thousand years, how many remain unknown? Of a thousand or ten thousand, how many meet the misfortune of obscurity, perishing unheard, rotting like grass and trees? How lamentable!\n\nFortunately, there are those who, out of devotion, record their lives in biographies. Yet often, these accounts exaggerate their deeds, rendering them unbelievable to later generations. I fear that the hearts of recluses do not hasten to seek obscurity or perform wonders to astonish the ears and eyes of others.\n\nWhat the world truly values in those who refine themselves as immortals lies not in riding clouds and mist, straddling the Tail of the Winnowing Basket (箕尾), parting water and fire, commanding crows to remove their caps, lifting their dwellings into the heavens, or achieving liberation in a single sitting or standing. Rather, it is in unwavering adherence to the Dao, secretly aiding others with merit, rectifying their bearing to awaken all beings, and abiding in harmony with the times.\n\nI have observed that in the old biographies of the *Arrayed Immortals*, *Comprehensive Immortals*, and *Lofty Daoists*, none escaped such embellishments—yet these works no longer survive. Now, the Perfected of Heavenly Music (天乐真人), Master Li Fu (李复), has compiled in his leisure the conduct and deeds of the departed masters and perfected who once dwelled in the ancestral court, arranging them into a separate record. This allows later generations to know their origins and roots. His words are direct and true, plain and clear, entirely free of exaggeration or artifice. Truly, this work can illuminate the hidden radiance of their virtue and serve as a model for later learners. How shallow could its purpose be?\n\nLong ago, Academician Liu (刘翰林) inscribed the immortal traces of the ancestral master on a stele, remarking: \"The master’s feats—exiting the body, entering dreams, tossing aside his umbrella, discarding his cap, and other acts of soaring, vanishing, and transformation—were but expedient means, not the essence of his teachings.\" Ah! If later scholars can embody the ancestral master’s苦志 (*ardent resolve*), refine their conduct, propagate transformation, and save others, thereby achieving both self-cultivation and the cultivation of others, then future chroniclers will naturally render just judgment. There is no need to claim exclusivity for our ancestral court.\n\nComposed on the second day of the second month in the *jiashen* year of the Zhiyuan era (至元甲申岁二月初吉), by Wang Daoming (王道明), Grand Master of Manifesting Constant Virtue (知常盛德大师), Supervisor of the Yuxian Palace at Ganhe Town, Mount Zhongnan.\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One of *The Esoteric Biographies of the Immortals and Perfected of the Ancestral Court of Mount Zhongnan***\nCompiled by Li Daoqian (李道谦), the Daoist of Heavenly Music of Yi Mountain (夷山天乐道人)\n\nThe Perfected Jade Toad (玉蟾真人)\n\nThe master’s secular surname was He (和), given name Dejin (德瑾), a native of Ganquan County in Qinzhou. Endowed with an elegant and refined nature, he devoted himself to literary studies in his youth and later withdrew from the world upon reaching adulthood. Though he served as a clerk versed in legal documents, he conducted himself with uprightness in all matters. His heart abided in the Dao, and he never took wealth that was not rightfully his. Whenever he encountered lofty persons or eminent scholars, he would invariably seek their counsel.\n\nDuring the Tiande era, when he was considering entering the path of officialdom, a Daoist suddenly passed by his door. The master invited him into his home, poured wine, and discoursed on the mysteries, greatly pleasing the Daoist’s sensibilities. After a short while, the Daoist departed. Another day, the Daoist returned, carrying a horned owl on his arm. He said to the master, “Though this creature has such large eyes, it utterly fails to recognize people.” The master then realized this was no ordinary person. He inquired after the Daoist’s hometown and name, but the Daoist left without answering.\n\nOver a month later, the Daoist returned, afflicted with a severe illness, and stayed at the master’s home. His body was covered in pus, blood, and filth, making it nearly unbearable to approach. The master summoned physicians, but no treatment proved effective. After a year, the Daoist passed away, and the master prepared a proper burial with full rites.\n\nSeveral months later, an elderly woman arrived at his door, weeping as she spoke: “This old woman has a son who is by nature fond of wandering like clouds and water, neglecting his family duties. I recently learned he was staying at your esteemed residence and came especially to find him.” The master informed her of the Daoist’s illness and death. The woman wailed inconsolably, saying, “This old woman and my son were our only two mouths to feed. Now that he is dead, where shall I find refuge?” The master offered to serve her as his own mother.\n\nOne day, the woman said, “I wish to open the coffin to see my son’s face once more. Even in death, I would have no regrets.” After repeated entreaties, the master had the grave opened, only to find an empty coffin. Inside lay a single secret missive, and the old woman had vanished without a trace.\n\nThe master sighed and said, “I have now encountered a true immortal, yet I remain mired in the dusty hall of the world. What am I truly here for?” From that moment, he cast aside his wife and children, changed his attire, and entered the Daoist path.\n\nAt that time, he heard that the Ancestral Master Chongyang had also encountered a perfected being and was residing on Mount Zhongnan. He went to pay his respects and seek instruction. In the third year of the Dading era, he built a thatched hut in Liujiang Village, living together with Lord Lingyang Li and two others. Gradually, his mind became perfectly attuned, and he attained the profound mysteries.\n\nIn the seventh year, *dinghai* (丁亥), when Chongyang journeyed to the eastern seas, the master and Lingyang remained to dwell in the Dao. In the spring of the tenth year, *gengyin* (庚寅), when the Four Perfected—Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu—were about to arrive, the master and Li Lingyang were then residing at the Taiping Palace on Mount Zhongnan. They left money with a noodle vendor, saying, “Today, four immortal guests—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—will arrive. Treat them well.”\n\nAfter some time, the four indeed arrived. The noodle vendor invited them in, saying, “Are you gentlemen not Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma?” The four looked at one another and smiled, asking, “How do you know this?” The vendor replied, “Masters He and Li have already left money for your noodles.” The four sighed in wonder. After eating, they went to meet the masters, and all were deeply harmonious in their encounter.\n\nThe master once instructed a painter to depict his true form, sleeping atop a tiger, though none could fathom its meaning. In the ninth month of autumn, the master suddenly felt his Dao-body unwell. Danyang ordered Changchun to attend to him. By the fourteenth day, his illness resolved, and he peacefully transformed.\n\nThe Four Perfected buried him beside the Liujiang Hermitage. The painting of the tiger-sleeping figure signified that the time of his ascension, marked by the cyclical year *yin* (寅), was revealed at the crown of his head.\n\nAfter his ascension, a certain Lord Zhang of Lintong had long suffered from a wind illness. No physician could cure him, and as he neared his final moments, he dreamed the master arrived at his door and instructed him in a method of treatment. When asked his name, the master replied, “I am He Yuchan of Mount Zhongnan.” Upon waking, his illness had slightly improved. He used the remedy prescribed in the dream, and his illness was indeed swiftly cured.\n\nLord Zhang of Jiufeng Hermitage held a vegetarian feast and built a pavilion to repay his kindness. The posthumous title bestowed upon him was *Yuchan Puming Chengji Zhenren* (\"Perfected One of Universal Clarity and Serene Quiescence\"). Today, an inscribed stele from the ancestral temple still remains.\n\nPerfected One Lingyang’s surname was Li, a native of Zhongnan County in Jingzhao. Exceptionally intelligent and quick-witted, his learning was vast and comprehensive. After an encounter with an extraordinary figure during the Tiande reign, he became detached, no longer concerning himself with family affairs. He regarded wealth and honor as floating clouds, and fame and profit as mere shackles. Roaming among springs and rocks, he found joy in the Dao, concealing his brilliance and shunning recognition. Thus, he never revealed his given name throughout his life, and the villagers simply called him *Li Zhenren* (\"Perfected One Li\").\n\nIn the third year of the Dading era, he, along with Ancestral Master Chongyang and He Yuchan, built thatched huts beside the Liujiang Hermitage. In his studies of lead, mercury, dragon, and tiger, he relied heavily on Chongyang’s guidance. In the summer of the seventh year (Dinghai), when Chongyang journeyed to the eastern seas, the master and He Yuchan remained at Liujiang to cultivate themselves and interact with others. Chongyang, upon reaching Bian, sent them a poem as a message. He Yuchan and Li had long shared a single aspiration, and their bond with Chongyang was evidently one of profound fellowship.\n\nBy the spring of the tenth year, Chongyang ascended as an immortal in Bianliang. The Four Perfected—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—entered Guanzhong and treated the two masters with the respect due to uncles. That autumn, Yuchan also departed through transformation, and the master remained with the assembly of perfected ones.\n\nIn the spring of the twenty-eighth year, on the first month, Master Qiu Changchun received an imperial summons to the court. As he took his leave, the master exhorted him, saying: “Chongyang once said you would surely expand the Mysterious Teaching—now is the time. Take care of yourself, and if the crane-drawn chariot returns early next spring, I shall await you to preside over my funeral rites.” In the eighth month, Changchun received the imperial decree to return to Zhongnan. That winter, he lingered among the mountains south of the Huai and the regions of Luo. The following spring, in the second month, as he journeyed west and passed through the outskirts of E and Qin渡镇, the local Daoist community entreated him to stay for several days. A fortnight earlier, the master had been in good health, yet he ceased eating grain. When questioned, he replied: “Do not worry for me; I await only the funeral presider.” He immediately dispatched someone to urge Changchun to return swiftly. Upon arrival, Changchun bowed at the master’s bedside, whereupon the master bestowed upon him an inkstick. Changchun understood his intent and ordered craftsmen to prepare a coffin. Before it was completed, the master peacefully transformed, on the first day of the third month. Changchun buried him with due rites beside the hermitage’s immortal burial ground, and his posthumous title was reverently inscribed as *Lingyang Huiyao Yanhua Zhenren* (\"Perfected One of Radiant Brilliance and Transformative Illumination\").\n\nMaster Liu Tongwei’s surname was Liu, his given name Tongwei, and his courtesy name Yuedao; his Daoist name was *Moranzi*. A native of Yecheng in Laizhou, his family had long been a prominent clan in the region. Free-spirited and unrestrained, he...\n\nIn his youth, he indulged in falconry, coursing hounds, cockfighting, and gambling, lost in the pleasures of flowers and wine. One day, he fell gravely ill, nearly beyond salvation. In a dream, he entered the realm of immortals, and upon recovery, he awakened to the principle of illusory transformation, holding the Dao in his heart.\n\nIn the summer of the *dinghai* year of the Dading era, Ancestral Master Chongyang was to journey to the eastern seas. Passing through Yecheng, he saw that Master Liu’s spirit was bright and transcendent, bearing the demeanor of one who might ascend to the clouds. Engaging him in conversation, their minds met in perfect accord. Chongyang imparted to him the secret instructions of cultivating truth and bestowed upon him his present name and style. Once Liu received this transmission, he immediately abandoned his home and family. Carrying a staff, he entered the Guanzhong region and built a thatched hut beside Gangu in the Zhongnan Mountains. There, he howled with the wind, chanted to the moon, rested his head upon rocks, and rinsed his mouth with flowing streams, roaming free beyond the dust of the world.\n\nIn the spring of the *gengyin* year, the four masters—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—came from the west. Master Liu rejoiced in their company and together they renovated the Liu-Jiang Hermitage. Later, the four masters journeyed to Bianliang, bearing Ancestral Master Chongyang’s immortal remains for burial beside the hermitage. Master Liu kept vigil at the graveside for three years before traveling north to the Lan-Guan region. Within, he embodied the wondrous subtleties of the Dao; without, he responded to the world’s needs. Those who came in Daoist robes seeking instruction filled his hall daily. Thus, he established an abbey to initiate disciples, and the mystic wind flourished on the western mountains. His illustrious reputation spread far, reaching the imperial capital.\n\nAt the beginning of the Mingchang era, Emperor Daoling summoned him to the palace and inquired about the ninefold cyclings and sevenfold refinements. Master Liu replied, “These are the pursuits of mountain recluses and rustics. Your Majesty, enthroned as the lord of the ninefold realm and sovereign of all within the four seas, need not dwell on such matters. It suffices to embrace the essentials of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi—clarity, stillness, non-action—in cultivating the self and governing the state.” The emperor was pleased and ordered him lodged at the Tianchang Abbey, later transferring him to the Yongshou Daoist Monastery. There, he expounded the Dao, and scholars of the Three Teachings and the Nine Schools thronged to his gate, their sandals filling the courtyard. Before long, he received an imperial decree permitting his return to the mountains, and the emperor bestowed upon him calligraphic scrolls to honor his journey.\n\nHe soared between Qi and Lu until, arriving at Nie Family Village in Shanghe County of Bozhou, he told his disciples, “This is where I shall rest.” He then renovated a dwelling and took up residence. One day, he burned incense and paid homage to the sages, gathering his followers to impart final instructions on cultivating truth. He said, “The summons of the Perfected has arrived; I must depart.” Suddenly, he transformed in quiet repose. It was the fifteenth day of the second month of the first year of the Cheng’an era, the *Zhenyuan* Festival. His lifetime of poems and lyrics, titled *The Complete Dao Collection*, circulated in the world. At the site of his immortal transformation, the grand Chaoyuan Palace was later built.\n\nMaster Shi Chuhou’s ancestral home was in Liquan of Qianzhou; his surname was Shi, his given name Gongmi. From childhood, he yearned for the supreme Dao. In the *renwu* year of the Dading era, hearing that Ancestral Master Chongyang had encountered immortals and received secret instructions, cultivating the Dao in Zhongnan, he hastened to seek initiation and was graciously accepted. Chongyang taught him the study of the perfected nature and destiny of the Quanzhen tradition and bestowed upon him the name Chuhou and the style Dongyangzi. Thereafter, he begged for alms to refine his heart, wandering between Zhongnan and Eshe.\n\nIn the spring of the *dinghai* year, Chongyang was to journey to the eastern seas and wished for him to accompany him. Master Shi declined, citing his aged mother, and dared not travel far.\n\nChongyang then painted a Daoist with three topknots standing amid clouds, with a pine and a crane beside him, and presented it to him, saying, \"Keep this carefully concealed—it shall serve as your future tally of mutual recognition.\" In the spring of the *gengyin* year, Chongyang ascended as an immortal in Bianliang. Master Danyang, leading the Three Friends, entered Guanzhong and arrived at Kongxian Hermitage in Chang’an. Master Shi hastened to pay his respects, and at that time, Danyang had just adopted the three topknots. Master Shi produced the painting Chongyang had left him long before, and all marveled greatly at it. The Four Masters recounted the teachings spread across the eastern seas and Chongyang’s ascension in Bianliang, each affirming the other’s understanding in turn. Overjoyed, he then joined the Four Masters in renovating Liu-Jiang Hermitage to reside there. Danyang frequently instructed him through poems and lyrics, guiding him step by step. Within a few years, he attained profound mastery.\n\nLater, he returned to Liquan, blending with the world while transcending its conventions, unbound by ritual or law. The people of the time called him Shi Fengzi. Suddenly, he danced and sang in the marketplace, declaring only, \"I return to Pengzhuang,\" which the common folk could not comprehend. After three days of this, he returned to the hermitage and peacefully shed his mortal form. This occurred on the fifteenth day of the sixth lunar month in the *jiawu* year. Officials, scholars, and commoners alike came to pay their respects.\n\nInitially interred in Liquan, the following year Danyang had him reburied in the immortal’s burial ground at Liu-Jiang. When the coffin was opened, his complexion appeared as in life. Danyang composed a four-character eulogy for him, saying:\n\n\"Master Shi encountered,\nEncountered Chongyang.\nChongyang transmitted,\nTransmitted the Mysterious Yellow.\nThe Mysterious Yellow’s supreme principle,\nIts supreme principle never forgotten.\nInternally, he cultivated refinement;\nExternally, he transcended heat and cold.\nWater and fire achieved harmony,\nSun and moon exchanged radiance.\nThe dragon chanted at *Li*’s position,\nThe tiger roared in *Kan*’s chamber.\nWood and metal inquired across separation,\nThe Crone and Maiden attained roundness and squareness.\nThe elixir blade gleamed with brilliance,\nDiscerning flavors, perceiving fragrances.\nThe divine cinnabar congealed in perfection,\nShimmering with crystalline yang.\nThe Wind Immortal came to deliver him,\nManifesting auspicious signs.\nDancing and singing for three days,\nHe bid farewell to the streets and lanes.\nDeclaring only, ‘I return,’\nHe hastened to Pengzhuang.\nReentering the hermitage,\nHe peacefully sat and shed his form.\nOnlookers gathered in throngs,\nThe event defied ordinary reason.\nHis singular spirit and true nature\nTook their place in the immortal ranks.\nThe Master’s Dao and deeds—\nReading this eulogy, one may see them clearly.\"\n\nHe lived seventy-three years. In the *guihai* year of Zhongtong, his immortal burial ground was relocated once more. When the tomb was reopened, though barely a century had passed, his bones, though scattered, gleamed like gold and were as hard as stone. I witnessed this myself—how extraordinary! Yan Chuchang.\n\nThe Master’s surname was Yan, given name Chuchang, and sobriquet Changqingzi. A native of Liyang County in Jingzhao, he was a maternal relative of the Patriarch Chongyang. In his youth, he studied the Confucian classics, aspiring to purity and emptiness. Yet with his parents still living, he could not rise above worldly concerns. Serving as a legal officer in the county, he approached his duties with compassion.\n\nOne evening on his way home, he found a discarded scroll by the road, titled *The Jade Numinous Scripture*, with the inscription: \"He who obtains this shall become an immortal.\" Thereupon, he burned incense and vowed: \"Now in my twenty-ninth year, I swear to purify myself and enter the Dao upon reaching the age of unconfusion.\" After the prayer, he poured wine into the ritual basin, where a sound arose like distant thunder—his family all marveled at the omen.\n\nLater, after twelve years had passed, both his parents passed away. Suddenly afflicted with an eye ailment, his condition worsened with treatment. He reproached himself in silence: \"Once I obtained the sacred scripture and vowed to leave home at forty—now the time has passed. Once this illness eases, I shall follow the Dao.\" Soon after, his vision cleared as before.\n\nHe then journeyed to Liujiang in Zhongnan, where he sought out Patriarch Chongyang, entreating to be accepted as a disciple. This was in the *guiwei* year of Dading. Once granted admission, the Master devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Dao. Over several years, the Patriarch imparted to him its subtle principles.\n\nIn the summer of the *dinghai* year, the Patriarch traveled east. The Master wandered among Zhongnan’s springs and rocks, dwelling in places that nurtured his spirit and cultivated his vital qi. In the tenth year, when the Four Masters—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—entered Guanzhong, he received further affirmation from Master Danyang, who also bestowed upon him a willow-branch poem:\n\n*\"One tiger, one dragon sleep in one place,*\n*Whirling in play.*\n*One breath, one inhalation complete one celestial cycle,*\n*Encompassing the Three Fields.*\n*One wheat, one hemp thread through one line,*\n*Swaying with auspicious mist.\"*\n\nOne arrival, one departure, one return to the origin—\ngiving birth to the immortal embryo.\nThe Master bowed in receipt, and from then on, all doubts and obstacles dissolved.\n\nHe dwelled at the Patriarch’s court for another decade, his Dao harmonizing with the true and constant. In the summer of the twenty-third year, on the eighth day of the fourth month—the *guimao* year—he burned incense, took leave of the assembly, and passed without illness at the age of seventy-three.\n\nMaster Yao Gai bore the surname Yao, with the personal name Xuan and the style Yunyangzi. A native of Jiangxia Village in Zhongnan, his family had long been a prominent clan in the region. His father and grandfather both delighted in relieving the poor and needy, accumulating abundant hidden virtue, and thus the Master was born. His bearing was free and untrammeled, his manner transcendent, marked by a natural detachment from the dust of the world. By nature deeply compassionate, upon hearing of another’s distress, he would invariably go to their aid.\n\nHe shared a distant kinship with Patriarch Chongyang. In the fourth month of the *dinghai* year of Dading, Chongyang came to bid him farewell. The Master asked where he intended to go, and Chongyang replied that he planned to journey to the eastern seas, the expedition of Qiu, Liu, Tan, and the \"catching of the horse\" in Zhong. The Master, who had long regarded him as afflicted by madness, merely smiled and parted ways.\n\nBefore long, Chongyang, from Bianjing, sent the Master a poem in the style of a \"hidden-head, split-character\" verse, which read:\n\n*\"Those met before—*\n*two officials.*\n*You are truly numinous,*\n*see the good cause.*\n*Touch the lingzhi sprouts—*\n*you, sir, do not yet recognize.\"*\n\nHaving attained the fruit of the Dao, one must next endure hardship.\nThe *Meng* hexagram gathers—divine spirits come to aid.\nThe left source flows freely, qi turns anew.\nAs an axe is sharpened, exchanges grow keen and swift.\nWith a single touch, he met Changchun.\n\nBefore many years had passed, the disciples of Danyang came to dwell at Liujiang Hermitage, a few *li* from the Master’s abode. Hearing of this, he went to inquire into the matter from beginning to end. Seeing that Masters Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma were all transcendent beings of towering stature, he gasped in astonishment and sighed: “The words Chongyang spoke at our parting have now indeed come to pass. How foolish we were to have long regarded him as mad!”\n\nFrom this, he suddenly awakened. Forsaking home and shedding all burdens, he sought to receive the Dao from Master Danyang. Danyang taught him the profound principles of cultivating truth and bestowed upon him his present name, also gifting him a poem that read:\n\n*Let the heart turn to ash, forgetting wealth and rank,*\n*The body wither, delighting in pure poverty.*\n*Willing to wander as a carefree traveler,*\n*Forever to be a free and unbound soul.*\n*Within qi, one must nurture qi;*\n*Within spirit, further preserve spirit.*\n*Cast off even the slightest pretense,*\n*Only then may one attain the utmost truth.*\n\nHe served at Danyang’s side, receiving much transmission. After obtaining the Dharma, the Master neither closed his eyes in sleep nor leaned against a mat. For over a decade, he delved deeply into the great mysteries.\n\nIn the *renyin* year, Danyang prepared to return to Ninghai, and the Master accompanied him. When Danyang ascended as an immortal, the Master traveled through Ci and Xiang, drawn to the simple and honest customs of Lanyang. He built Baiyun Hermitage to reside there, adapting to circumstances to guide and transform others.\n\nOne day, he addressed the assembly, saying: “The Teacher’s true destiny has been decreed—shall I return?” Thereupon, he bathed, changed his robes, and sat in lotus posture as the sun reached its zenith. At midday, he silently returned to the truth. An extraordinary fragrance filled the air, lingering for some time before dispersing. He lived to the age of seventy-two. His collected poems and lyrics, titled *The Shattering of Delusion*, circulated in the world.\n\nMaster Cao Tian, whose surname was Cao and given name Tian, styled himself Chaoxuzi, hailed from Fangzhou in Shaanxi. His family was immensely wealthy, and his nephew Huimeishu had early passed the imperial examinations. From youth, the Master studied diligently, and his village praised him for his filial piety and fraternal duty. He was loyal, sincere, humble, and gentle, with a noble and unrestrained bearing in his prime.\n\nMaster Cao traveled through the examination halls and repeatedly placed among the highest selections. In the *jiayin* year of the Dading era (1194), during a day of leisure, he perused Daoist scriptures and classics. Closing the scroll, he sighed: “Human life in this floating world passes like lightning, fleeting in an instant. If one does not explore the wondrous origin of existence before birth, what purpose do lofty aspirations serve?” Though he harbored the aspiration to study the Dao, he knew not where to turn.\n\nHearing that Master Danyang resided in a humble abode at the ancestral court of Zhongnan, the Master journeyed there directly. Upon their first meeting, their spirits harmonized and their *qi* aligned, as if bound by a predestined affinity. Danyang welcomed him into his discipleship and taught him the essentials of the Dao. The Master, having received this guidance, knew that encountering a perfected being was no easy matter. Thus, he relinquished his ambitions for worldly advancement and pledged lifelong devotion.\n\nDanyang recognized the Master’s transcendent spirit and profound insight. One day, as the Master sat in silent meditation in his chamber, striving for stillness, Danyang visited him and asked: “Is your learning advancing?” The Master bowed deeply and knelt before him, saying: “I wish to advance, yet I have not yet attained it.” Danyang replied: “Stillness is the origin of Heaven’s mandate and the foundation of immortals and sages. To cultivate and advance in it is like borrowing wings to ascend the heavens. To reflect and delve deeply is like sitting in a hall and gazing upon the steps before you. Without striving for stillness, you will be serene yet untroubled. Without striving for truth, you will act without delusion.”\n\nThe Master bowed in gratitude and said: “I have grasped it. From now on, I will trust without doubt and perceive without obscurity. From ancient times to the present, the unbroken thread of transmission—does it not refer to this?” Danyang nodded in approval, and the Master bowed twice more before withdrawing.\n\nLater, the first among the ten *jieyuan* of the Mystery Gate (*xuanmen*) originated with the Master. Whenever newcomers entered the Dao, Danyang regarded the Master as their elder brother. In the *renyin* year (1182), Danyang prepared to return to Ninghai, and the Master accompanied him. The following year, Danyang ascended as an immortal, and the Master succeeded him in propagating the Dao along the coast.\n\nDuring the Mingchang era (1190–1196), at the behest of Master Changchun, he joined Su of Yunzhong and Liu the Unsullied in flying to Wu, Yan, and Ji, where they expounded the Dao, transformed lives, and responded to circumstances with boundless compassion. For over a decade, the mysterious transformation flourished. In the summer of the *dingmao* year of the Taihe era (1217), the fourth month, while residing at the Yongshou Abbey in the eastern part of the Yan capital, the Master suddenly addressed his disciples: “I shall return now.” Within days, he manifested a slight illness and passed away. The Daoist community prepared rites and interred him east of the abbey after the war.\n\nIn the winter of the *yisi* year (1225), his remains were reburied on Wuhua Mountain. In the *gengxu* year (1230), by imperial decree, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Perfected of Illuminating Mystery, Upright Virtue, and Morning Emptiness, at the request of the Perfected of True Constancy, who presided over the teachings.\n\n---\n\nMaster Lai Lingyu hailed from a prominent family of the right district of Jingzhao. His surname was Lai, his given name Lingyu, and his Daoist name Zhenyangzi. From childhood, he studied Confucian classics, and his village addressed him as *jieyuan*. In the tenth year of the Dading era (1170), he took leave of Master Danyang to become a Daoist. When Danyang later returned to the coast, the Master accompanied him. No further records of his later activities survive; here, only the broad outlines are noted. Should more details emerge, they shall be recorded in full.\n\n---\n\nMaster Lei Datong’s surname was Lei, his given name Datong, and his Daoist name Hongyangzi. His family was a great clan of Fuzheng in Yan’an. Tall of stature, with an elegant and detached demeanor, he paid no heed to trivial matters. His brows were sparse, his eyes bright, his ears large and straight, his lips as red as cinnabar, and his beard fine and handsome.\n\nFrom youth, he studied Confucianism and once topped the local examinations in poetry and rhapsody, earning the title *jieyuan*. In the spring of the *yiwei* year of the Dading era (1175), as he read late into the night, the lamp burned bright, the moon shone clear, and the wind was gentle. As the third watch neared, he suddenly heard the sound of a staff tracing the ground outside his window, followed by a voice saying:\n\n*“Alas for the foolish and deluded, laboring in vain—*\n*Fleeting glory, a dream turned to emptiness in an instant.*\n*How much better to set one’s resolve on cultivating immortality,*\n*And dwell forever in the highest palace of the Three Mountains!”*\n\nThe Master flung open the door and looked out, but saw nothing. Holding a candle, he examined the ground and found four lines of verse traced by a staff, followed by the characters *cha xi* (forked path). From that moment, he awakened to the emptiness of worldly splendor and resolved to study the Dao.\n\nThat autumn, while traveling to Chang’an for the examinations, he heard that Master Danyang was expounding the teachings of the Quanzhen school at the ancestral court of Zhongnan. He went to pay his respects, and at their first meeting, they felt as if bound by a predestined affinity. He composed two quatrains expressing his aspirations and presented them to Danyang. The Master responded in kind, matching the rhyme:\n\n*“Though your renown surpasses Su Qin’s,*\n*It is not like concealing your light and hiding your name.*\n*Beyond the world, carefree and unburdened,*\n*At first awakening, the light of nature shines clear.*\n\n*Stillness and purity are the secrets of longevity,*\n*Passed down without words, forsaking wife and children.*\n*Once enlightened, how can one cling to existence?*\n*Naturally, the finest causes and conditions arise.”*\n\nThe Master burned incense, bowed, and requested to become a disciple. Danyang kept him by his side and instructed him in the present and future significance of the Dao. Morning and evening, he sought the Way and made great progress.\n\nIn the summer of the *renyin* year (1182), when Danyang prepared to return to the coast, the Master remained at the ancestral court, advancing in his Daoist practice. In the spring of the *jiachen* year (1184), hearing that Danyang had ascended as an immortal and was wandering the coast with staff and sandals, he traveled to pay his respects at the master’s tomb. By the beginning of the Mingchang era (1190), he gradually made his way west, passing through Teng Prefecture. Enamored of the secluded valleys and towering peaks of Fengshan, he built a hermitage for cultivation at Xiangshi Gully. There, he nurtured his true nature, preserved his vast *qi*, and propagated the Dao to transform lives. Thereafter, hundreds of disciples came to his door to receive his teachings.\n\nThe Perfected Lingzhen, Ma Liaodao, and the Perfected Qingming, Wang Zhizhuan, having entered the inner chamber of the lineage, now established their own abodes to guide and receive later generations.\n\nIn the autumn of the *xinsi* year of the Da’an era (1211), the Master addressed his disciples, saying: \"The cycle of a hundred and six has reached its end, and the calamities of the kalpa are now upon us. Living beings are as fish on the chopping block—I cannot bear to remain in the world.\" Shortly thereafter, he manifested a minor illness and passed away. His disciples buried him beside the Cultivation Hermitage. Before long, war and chaos erupted, and smoke from beacon fires filled the valleys. Later, when the Great Yuan pacified the land and the populace gradually gathered again, in the *gengxu* year (1250), the Master’s eminent disciple, the Perfected Qingxu, Zhang Zhidong, arrived from Wuchuan. Seeing the Master’s burial site—humble in scale and overgrown with weeds—he convened the four directions’ disciples and kin. They prepared robes and a stone outer coffin, then reinterred him in the Immortal’s Burial Ground at the Divine Capital Palace on Snow Mountain. His disciples, Ma Lingzhen and Wang Qingming, were positioned to his left and right, and a hall was constructed with an image to maintain the incense offerings.\n\n**Master Liu Zhenyi**\nMaster Liu Zhenyi, whose surname was Liu and personal name Zhenyi, bore the Daoist name Langranzi. His family, a prominent household of Huang County in Dengzhou, had risen through Confucian scholarship, accumulating virtue and revering the Dao, earning the praise of their village. Orphaned of his father in youth, the Master read voraciously, memorizing thousands of words daily, his literary talent vast and profound. In his early twenties, he sat for the spring examinations and placed among the highest ranks, earning the title *jieyuan* from his contemporaries. Yet he regarded worldly affairs as unworthy of attachment, ever harboring lofty and transcendent aspirations. Suddenly, he contracted a debilitating illness of chronic diarrhea, lingering for over a year. Even the most potent medicines failed to cure him.\n\nIn the autumn of the *jichou* year of the Dading era (1169), Ancestor Chongyang, accompanied by the Three Perfected—Danyang, Changzhen, and Changchun—passed by his home. His mother prepared a vegetarian feast to honor them and informed them of her son’s illness. The Ancestor examined him and declared: \"This is a great being of my lineage, not merely your family’s son. If you permit him to enter the Dao, he may yet recover.\" His mother burned incense and knelt before him, saying: \"If this illness is truly cured, I shall have him attend you in your old age.\" The Ancestor gave him the remnants of his drink. After consuming it, the Master’s sweat poured forth like a bath, and his illness gradually abated.\n\nBy the following year, the Ancestor had ascended as an immortal in Bianliang. The Master entered the Pass and journeyed to Liujiang Village in Zhongnan to pay homage to Master Danyang. He left the household life, served the Master, and after a long time, received the transmission of the profound teachings. In the summer of the *renyin* year (1182), he returned east with Danyang. In the winter of the *guimao* year (1183), as Danyang prepared to ascend as an immortal, he summoned the Master and instructed him: \"If you wish to become immortals, you must accumulate merit and virtuous deeds. Even if you encounter a thousand demons and ten thousand hardships, take care not to retreat or falter. Only then can you comprehend my words. Whether my eyes are open or closed, I see all. The seeing does not lie in the eyes; if the heart is perfectly clear, nothing remains unseen.\" He added: \"Your destiny lies in the north. You may go there.\" The Master bowed in gratitude.\n\nAfter Danyang ascended as an immortal, the Master wandered north to the lands of Ping and Luan. Wherever he went, those seeking his teachings filled the courtyards. One day, he reached Funing County, enamored of its fine mountains and waters, and built the Chongyang Abbey to reside there. Thereafter, he initiated thousands of disciples and established over three hundred temples and abbeys, large and small. The flourishing of the Dao in the north owed much to his efforts.\n\nOn the sixth day of the second month in the *bingyin* year of the Taihe era (1206), he summoned his inner-chamber disciples, Di Daoming and others, saying: \"I shall soon depart. Recall the words Danyang spoke to me before his ascension—let none of you forget them. The *Collection of Gold and Jade* is essential reading for all who enter the Dao. Have it carved into printing blocks and disseminated widely.\" Moments later, he peacefully passed away. His lifetime of songs and poems, titled *The Responsive Karma Collection*, circulated in the world.\n\n**Master Li Dacheng**\nMaster Li Dacheng, whose surname was Li, hailed from a great clan of Huating County in Pingdong Prefecture. In his youth, he studied Confucian classics and excelled in literary composition. In his early years, he passed the local examinations, but by middle age, he failed the imperial examinations. With a sigh, he harbored aspirations for the misty mountains.\n\nIn the autumn of the *wuxu* year of the Dading era (1178), Master Danyang traveled west to propagate the Dao. The Master invited him to his private residence, where Danyang discoursed daily on the wonders of the Dao. Thereupon, the Master dismissed his wife, abandoned his burdens, changed his attire, and became Danyang’s disciple. Danyang bestowed upon him the name Dacheng and the Daoist title Lingyangzi. Day by day, he received the true teachings, plumbing their profound depths.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the second month in the *jihai* year (1179), Danyang built a walled hermitage in the Master’s flower garden and resided there with him for a hundred days. He presented the Master with a poem:\n*In the northwest, a walled hermitage stands by the river,*\n*Here I may conceal my form.*\n*Before me, noble bamboo—several gentlemen,*\n*Facing verdant pines—two great men.*\n*Flowing water and artificial hills—mere child’s play,*\n*But do you understand the clear wind and bright moon?*\n*If you can grasp the meaning of my planted leeks,*\n*You may share in the radiant light bound for the Jade Capital.*\n\n(Note: The Master had planted leeks within the walled garden to convey a hidden meaning.)\n\nDanyang also noticed a withered tree in the flower garden that had long since died. On the fourteenth day of the fourth month, he ordered it moved and replanted within the walled garden, then composed another poem:\n*Thirty-six above in the heavens,*\n*Thirty-six below on the earth.*\n*Heaven and earth enter the precious vase,*\n*And the seventy-two seasonal nodes are complete.*\n\nBy the twentieth day of the fifth month, green shoots sprouted, and the withered trunk revived. Danyang said to the Master: \"The fourteenth day of the fourth month is the birthday of Pure Yang’s descent into the world, and it is also my birthday. Thirty-six days separate them, and the union of heaven and earth’s day and night completes the seventy-two seasonal nodes.\" The Master recorded this marvel in *The Record of the Wondrous Tree* and inscribed it on a stele.\n\nBefore long, Danyang brought the Master to the ancestral court in Zhongnan, where he resided for several years, repeatedly receiving the Master’s approval. In the *renyin* year (1182), as Danyang prepared to return east, Changchun said to the Master: \"Our Dao now turns eastward.\" At that time, Liu Wujie of Guantao, a friend of the Master, had been appointed to an official post in E Prefecture. Upon completing his term, he invited the Master to travel east with him.\n\nUpon returning home, they built a hermitage to honor him. Liu also entered the Dao and became a disciple. Thereafter, the Dao flourished daily, and disciples gathered like clouds. Several years later, the Master manifested a minor illness and passed away in accordance with the natural course. His body was as light as a cicada’s sloughed husk, and those who witnessed it from near and far marveled greatly. His disciples prepared the rites and buried him beside the hermitage. After the warfare in Guanzhong, the Daoist community, following the Master’s example, extensively constructed the Taiqing Abbey on the garden grounds of Huating.\n\nMaster Zhao Jiuyuan, whose surname was Zhao, personal name Jiuyuan, and courtesy name Jidao, was styled Zhanranzi. His family had long been a prominent clan in Long’an County of Longzhou. From childhood, the Master differed from other children in play, and as he grew, his nature was cautious and sincere, his demeanor quiet and reserved. Tall and imposing in stature, he possessed an open and unrestrained bearing. He studied Confucian scholarship and once passed the provincial examination at the top rank, earning the title *jieyuan* among the people of Long. Yet he did not pursue official rank, often harboring the aspiration to withdraw from the world. Beyond thirty, he remained unmarried.\n\nIn the autumn of the *wuxu* year of the Dading era (1178), Master Danyang propagated the Dao in Longchuan, and those who turned toward him gathered in great numbers. The Master, upon seeing him, was deeply moved, saying, “This is where I shall find my repose.” Thereupon, he prepared a vegetarian feast, lit incense, and requested to join the ranks of disciples; Danyang accepted him. The following year, when Danyang returned to the ancestral court, the Master followed and resided there. Morning and evening, he inquired and studied the teachings of the Dao, virtue, nature, and destiny, gaining profound insight.\n\nBy the *renyin* year (1182), when Danyang’s immortal retinue returned east, the Master traveled between Zhongnan and the Feng and Long mountains, wandering freely as before. During Zhang Bangzhi of Henei’s tenure as magistrate of Fufeng, he often invited the Master to his home to discourse on the Dao. The Master would stay for months, forming a bond of transcendent friendship. His writings favored simplicity, his poetry refined and vigorous, evoking the style of Tao Yuanming and Xie Lingyun. Daily, he recited the *Laozi*, *Zhuangzi*, and *Huangting Jing* as his regular practice, and no improper words ever passed his lips. When others spoke of others’ faults, he would close his eyes and refuse to engage, saying only, “Such talk only harms virtue and invites resentment. To be strict with oneself and lenient toward others—this is the sage’s teaching.” Thus, wherever he went, people revered and admired him.\n\nIn the final years of the Zhengda era, when warfare erupted in Feng and Long, the Master carried his belongings deep into the Long Mountains, and his fate thereafter remained unknown.\n\nWhen the Great Yuan brought governance and rectitude to the realm, the Perfected Master of Penetrating Truth, Yu Jun, was ordered by imperial decree to preside over the ancestral sanctuary of Mount Zhongnan. Seeking the Master’s lost writings, he obtained them from Zheng Lian, a Daoist adept of Youde Abbey in Longzhou, and titled them *The Collection of Contemplating the Mysterious*. In the early years of the Zhongtong era, Zhao Zhichong, a disciple of the Master at the Haotian Abbey in Jingzhao, established a propitious site north of the prefectural city. He invited Meng Panlin, a Hanlin Academician, to compose an inscription, and erected a tomb to inter the Master’s ceremonial robes, ensuring offerings in spring and autumn.\n\nMaster Su, surnamed Su, named Xuan, styled Yunzhongzi, was a native of Pucheng in Huazhou. By nature, he was generous and kind, modest and fond of propriety. When he encountered misty peaks and scenic vistas, he would forget to return all day. In the spring of the Xinmao year of the Dading era, he journeyed to the ancestral sanctuary of Mount Zhongnan to seek initiation under Master Danyang. He knelt before him, entreating enlightenment. Danyang kept him close, teaching him the rites and disciplines of entering the Dao. After years of devoted service, he never once slackened. Danyang transmitted to him the mysteries of the Dao and frequently composed poems and lyrics to guide him, urging him to cultivate true attainment. Eventually, his heart-source became luminous, and his Dao-body harmoniously merged. At that time, all his fellow Daoists regarded him as a \"Lesser Danyang,\" a testament to his profound mastery of the Dao.\n\nLater, he took leave of his teacher and traveled to the eastern seas, blending with the world while upholding the lineage and spreading the teachings. In the summer of the Renyin year, when Danyang returned east, the Master attended him once more, remaining by his side until Danyang’s ascension. He then lingered in the region of Deng and Lai. In the early Mingchang era, Master Changchun commanded him to propagate the teachings in Yan and Ji, residing at Chongfu Abbey. The Dao flourished daily, and his followers grew numerous. One day, he said to his disciples, “When will the world’s dusty affairs ever end? I shall return.” With these words, colorful clouds swirled in the sky. He reclined, resting his head on his arm, and passed away. In the winter of the Yisi year of the Zhida era, the Perfected Master of Purity and Harmony relocated his remains to the immortal burial grounds of Wuhua Mountain. By imperial decree, the Perfected Master of True Constancy posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of the Clouds, Rectifier of the Dao, and Auxiliary of Primordial Power*.\n\nMaster Yu, from Hedong in Dizhou, surnamed Yu, named Tongqing, styled Taining, and known by his Daoist name Zhen’guangzi, was born after his mother dreamed of a divine being who gave her a cinnabar pellet to swallow, resulting in her pregnancy. On the day of his birth, a crimson light filled the room, lingering for half a day before dissipating. Having lost his father in early childhood, his home was near the Divine Empyrean Palace. In his youth, his mother took him to burn incense at the palace hearth. Pointing to the sacred image, he asked, “Can one become such a divine being?” His mother replied, “Only those who dedicate themselves to the Dao may draw near.” The Master silently assented, and from then on, he often visited the palace to play. Whenever he saw a Daoist master reciting scriptures, he would sit quietly beside him, listening intently until the recitation ended before departing.\n\nAs he grew older, he conducted himself with uprightness and paid no heed to family property. He harbored a constant aspiration to transcend worldly concerns, though he knew not where to turn. In his twentieth year, his mother passed away. He buried and mourned her with full rites. In the Jihai year of the Dading era, a Daoist suddenly arrived at his door begging for food. The Master fed him and asked where he was headed. The Daoist replied that he was traveling to Mount Zhongnan to visit a teacher. The Master then accompanied him and paid homage to Master Danyang at the ancestral sanctuary. Danyang inquired about his intentions, and the Master truthfully recounted his circumstances. Danyang kept him at his side, where he performed menial tasks for years. One day, Danyang wrote out a code of conduct and handed it to him, saying, “Follow this, and the ranks of immortality may be attained.” He also repeatedly transmitted true instructions, enabling the Master to achieve perfect clarity of heart and nature.\n\nWhen Danyang later returned east, he left the Master to reside at the ancestral sanctuary. In the Xinhai year of the Mingchang era, when Changchun also returned from the eastern seas, the Master followed him to Taixu Abbey in Qixia. After several more years, Changchun approached him and said, “The teachings of the sages and worthies are about to flourish. You may go to Beijing and other places to propagate our Dao.” He then entrusted him with a personal letter and conferred upon him the authority of the teachings. The Master accepted the command and resided in the capital’s outskirts for three years. His divine radiance was often witnessed, and officials and commoners alike entreated him to emerge. Countless seekers came to inquire about the mysteries of the Dao, all departing enriched. Thereafter, the Dao flourished daily, and he initiated over a thousand disciples, though only Lu Rouhe and Ding Zhiyi were deemed his closest followers.\n\nHe selected an auspicious site in the northeastern outskirts of the capital and built Huayang Abbey to serve as his residence, also styling himself the *Recluse of Tuyang*. In the Jisi year of the Da’an era, the Perfected Master Yuyang arrived from the north with his immortal retinue and lodged at the abbey. Shortly after, he took the Master to the capital of Yan, where he was bestowed with the purple robe and the title of Master. From then on, his reputation soared, and his disciples multiplied. In the Jiaxu year of the Zhenyou era, he received a summons from Changchun and returned to Taixu Abbey in Qixia to oversee its affairs. When the Xingding era began, bandits stirred unrest, and he relocated to Xiushan Hermitage in Xingshan Village, Fushan County.\n\nOne day, the Master gathered his followers and announced, “Today, the weather is clear, and the northern troops are at rest. I shall return.” He then bathed, wrote a verse, and said:\n*“This morning, I topple the rootless tree,\nIn an instant, I overturn the alchemical furnace.\nUnobstructed, I depart alone,\nLeaning on my staff, I journey to Penglai.”*\nHe cast aside his brush, closed his eyes, and passed away at the age of fifty-six. At that moment, five-colored clouds enveloped the hermitage, lingering all day without dispersing. After the war, Li Zhifang, a dharma-grandson of the abbot of Tianqing Abbey in Zhangde Prefecture, relocated the Master’s remains and interred them in the immortal burial grounds of Wangyu Village northwest of the prefectural city, where a hall was built to enshrine his incense and spirit.\n\nMaster Zhao, surnamed Zhao, named Wuxuan, styled Zishen, and known by his Daoist name Liaozhenzi, was a native of Lintong in Jingzhao. His family had long been farmers. He remained in his mother’s womb for twelve months and was born on the second day of the fifth month of the first year of the Tiande era. At the moment of his birth, a divine radiance filled the room, astonishing all who witnessed it. His relatives marveled at the omen.\n\nAs he grew older, his aspirations turned to purity and emptiness, finding no delight in worldly pleasures. In the spring of the *gengyin* year of the Dading era, Master Danyang of the Quanzhen lineage, accompanied by his three companions Qiu, Liu, and Tan, entered the Pass and passed through Lingkou Town. The Master, recognizing their extraordinary nature, invited them to his home and prepared a vegetarian feast in their honor. Thereupon, together with his mother, Madame Wei, his elder sister, younger brother, wife, and nephew—six in all—they journeyed to the ancestral hermitage on Mount Zhongnan and sought ordination under Master Danyang. At the time, Danyang was urgently engaged in saving sentient beings and establishing teachings, and all six were granted admission. Each was entrusted with the subtle principles of cultivating the True, and in subsequent years, Danyang frequently guided them with Dharma teachings. All became accomplished figures in the Daoist tradition, though the Master served Danyang the longest. After receiving the transmission, he resided for several years at the hermitage of Liu and Jiang.\n\nIn the *gengzi* year, Zhao En of Jingzhao donated his residence to establish Penglai Hermitage, inviting the Master to reside there. He accepted without hesitation and remained in silent meditation for over a decade. Later, a Daoist friend from Qin Village in Chunhua County of Hezhou, surnamed Li, built a hermitage and invited the Master to dwell there. He stayed for twelve years, attaining the perfect accord of mind and Dao. He broke off four cypress branches and planted them in the hermitage, praying for their flourishing.\n\nDuring the Taihe era, Zhui Xiyi of Fanchuan in Xianning County, having heard of the Master’s attainment, built a hermitage and invited him to reside there. One day, the Master’s disciple Zhui Du was patrolling the tea houses of Jingzhao when he encountered a Daoist begging for alms. He gave the man a single coin and departed. Over a month later, Zhui Du returned home and paid his respects to the Master in his humble abode. Seeing him, the Master exclaimed in surprise, “This is the Daoist who begged for alms in the tea house!” Zhui Du asked, “Has the Master ever gone out?” The Master replied, “No.” Thereupon, Zhui Du burned incense, bowed in reverence, and offered his ancestral cypress grove in Zhuyang Village—known as Bopo—as a site for the Master to build Quandao Hermitage, a perpetual sanctuary for cultivating the True.\n\nThe Master once told his disciple Ran Yiqi, “The Great White Temple in Jingzhao is where the Primordial Daoist Ancestor, Lord Lao, manifested his teachings. Previously, Danyang built a hall beside it, and in the future, it will surely become a grand Daoist sanctuary. You should reside there.” The Master himself frequently came and went from the temple, and today it has indeed become a renowned abbey. After several years, the Master returned once more to Chunhua.\n\nOn the seventeenth day of the third month in the third year of the Daan era, he passed away without illness at the age of sixty-three. His lifetime compositions of Daoist poetry and lyrics, titled *The Ladder to Immortality*, circulated in the world. He ordained several hundred disciples, with only Wang Deyu and Ran Yiqi entering his inner chamber. Later, he was reburied at Bopo in Quandao Hermitage in Fanchuan, where Assistant Magistrate Yang Tingxiu of Pingdong was invited to compose a stele inscription to record his Daoist conduct. After the Tianxing military campaign, the site of Quandao Hermitage was extensively renovated into Cuiwei Abbey.\n\nIn the renzi year, the Perfected of True Constancy offered incense at the ancestral court and posthumously bestowed upon him the title \"Perfected of Vast Mystery.\"\n\n**Master Duan Mingyuan**\nMaster Duan, a native of Pingshui, held the Dharma name Guangpu, the courtesy name Mingyuan, and the Daoist name Zhenyangzi. As a child, he was quick-witted; in adulthood, he was bold and chivalrous. After injuring someone while drunk, he fled to Guanzhong to evade punishment. By chance, he arrived at the ancestral court on Mount Zhongnan, where he heard Master Danyang expounding the Dao and experienced profound awakening. Thereupon, he burned incense, bowed in reverence, and earnestly begged to leave the household life. Danyang assented, and he humbly performed menial tasks in service to his master. Over the years, he gradually attained realization in his heart. One day, kneeling before his teacher, Danyang instructed him to \"diminish desires, settle the mind, subdue the strong, and blunt the sharp.\" Having received the master’s affirmation, he practiced the teachings he had received. Within a few years, he attained clarity of mind and ascended to the wondrous Dao. He then took up his staff and returned to Hedong, where he built Liaozhen Hermitage north of Jishan County’s city walls. From then on, many sought refuge under him.\n\nIn the summer of the renyin year, he suddenly told his disciples, “Master Danyang will soon arrive. Prepare offerings of incense, and follow me to pay our respects.” He immediately set out with his assembly, and upon reaching Tong Pass, the immortal’s procession indeed arrived. Danyang inquired about his cultivation, and the Master responded with his progress. Danyang sighed, saying, “Guanzhong already has Zhao Wuxuan, and Hedong now has Duan Mingyuan—our teaching has found its transmission.” The Master bowed in farewell and returned, his reputation in the Dao ever higher.\n\nYang Mingzhen of Sanyuan, hearing of him, traveled to pay his respects and seek instruction. He received much guidance and was later presented with a poem titled *Words of One Beyond the World*. In the second month of the second year of the Mingchang era, on the twenty-eighth day, the Master summoned his disciples and said, “I shall journey to the Three Mountains.” He bathed, wrote a verse, and recited:\n\n*For years I delighted in quietude,*\n*Brightness of nature shone like a candle’s glow.*\n*Spirit roams the paths of the Three Isles,*\n*Qi weaves the six-zhu robe.*\n*Unfettered, unbound,*\n*Carefree, beyond right and wrong.*\n*Silent, with nothing to do—*\n*The crane-borne carriage returns on colored clouds.*\n\nHaving written this, he reclined on his arm and passed away. His eyes remained radiant for days, never closing. With full rites, he was buried beside Liaozhen Hermitage. His lifetime songs and poems, titled *The Mingyuan Collection*, circulated in the world.\n\n*End of Volume One of* The Inner Transmission of Immortals and Perfected of the Ancestral Court on Mount Zhongnan\n*Volume Two of* The Inner Transmission of Immortals and Perfected of the Ancestral Court on Mount Zhongnan *begins*\n\nLiyuan of Yishan, the Celestial Music Daoist, compiled by Li Daoqian\n\nMaster Liu Kaiwu, styled Jiuji, with the Daoist name Wu Ranzi, was a native of Fangzhou in Shaanxi. Of the Liu clan, he was by nature intelligent and taciturn, disdaining ostentation despite his family’s wealth. Having studied for the imperial examinations, he possessed broad knowledge and a prodigious memory, excelling in composition. After twice sitting for the palace examination, he returned home, where his literary talent earned him the post of Registrar of the Prefecture School.\n\nIn the spring of the *renchen* year of the Dading era, while traveling in Chang’an, he encountered Master Danyang of the Quanzhen lineage. Their conversation, along with a poem bestowed upon him, awakened something within the Master, who then abandoned his household to follow the teacher. Residing at Liu-Jiang Ancestral Hermitage for a decade, he made great progress in the Dao. Among Danyang’s disciples were Cao Xu, Lai Lingyu, Liu Zhenyi, Li Dacheng, Lei Datong, Li Dajing, and Zhao Jiuyuan—together with the Master, they were known as the \"Ten *Jieyuan* of the Mystic Gate.\"\n\nWhen Danyang prepared to return to the east, the Master and his fellow disciples accompanied him. After Danyang ascended as an immortal, the Master, following the command of Master Changchun of the Quanzhen lineage in the *wenchen* year of the Mingchang era, propagated the teachings in Yan and Ji. Later, he moved to Qixuan Hermitage in Gu’an, where he passed away in the first year of the Chongqing era.\n\nIn the winter of the *yisi* year, after the wars, the Perfected Qinghe relocated his remains to Wuhua Mountain. In the winter of the *gengxu* year, the Preceptor Zhenchang, by imperial decree, posthumously bestowed upon him the title \"Perfected Wu Ran of Illustrious Mystery and Lofty Virtue,\" and composed an epitaph for his tombstone.\n\n---\n\nMaster Ren Shouyi, styled Ziranzi, was of the Ren clan, a farming family from Hu County in Jingzhao. Tall and robust, with an open and magnanimous disposition, he cared little for trivial conventions and delighted in hunting. One night, he dreamed of being seized by ghostly messengers and taken to the underworld, where he witnessed the interrogation and torture of sinners. Awakening with sudden insight, he broke his bow and snapped his arrows, swearing before Heaven to reform his past ways.\n\nSeeking to renew his virtue, he journeyed to Liu-Jiang Ancestral Hermitage and sought instruction from Master Danyang of the Quanzhen lineage. Danyang initially rejected him, but after several days, seeing the steadfastness of his resolve, finally accepted him, assigning him to humble tasks within the hermitage.\n\nAfter three years of tending to meals and humble service, Shouyi’s diligence only deepened, never slackening for even a moment. Moved by his devotion, Danyang imparted to him the true oral instructions, teaching him to endure humiliation, subdue the heart, and refine his spirit and qi. Over time, his mind grew empty and luminous, and he gradually gained insight.\n\nOne day, he knelt before his master and said: “Though base and foolish, I have been awakened by your guidance. Yet I have nothing to repay you—would you, in your compassion, not disdain my clumsiness and allow me to continue drawing water and tending the hearth for three more years?” Danyang refused, saying: “Before, when you had not yet awakened, you were right to serve with diligence. Now that you have gained some attainment, you must advance in true practice and guide those who come after.”\n\nThereupon, Shouyi took his leave and wandered north of the Yellow River, begging for alms as his Way flourished day by day. In the winter of the *guimao* year of the Dading era (1183), when he learned that Danyang had returned to the True, he built a hut by his master’s grave and kept vigil for three years. Soon after, he suddenly summoned his disciples and said: “Last night, my master’s true spirit gave me a command—to follow him to the Daoist mountain.” He bathed, changed his robes, and peacefully passed away on the fourteenth day of the fourth month in the first year of the Mingchang era (1190). After the war, his disciples reburied him at Chongyang Abbey in Baijian Village, Penglai County, Dengzhou, where they erected a hall and enshrined his image.\n\n---\n\nYang Mingzhen, whose family name was Yang, was a native of Sanyuan County in Yaozhou. His father was Fan, and his mother was of the Liu clan. He was born on the eighteenth day of the eleventh month in the *gengwu* year of the Tiande era (1150). At the moment of his birth, a blue-green qi filled the room. As a child, he was stern and aloof, refusing to play with other children. As he grew, he often sighed at the fleeting nature of mortal life and yearned for the Way of immortality.\n\nIn the fourteenth year of the Dading era (1174), hearing that Master Danyang was propagating the great teachings of Quanzhen at the ancestral sanctuary on Mount Zhongnan, he abandoned his home and journeyed to his door, begging for instruction. Seeing his tall, robust frame and open, magnanimous bearing, Danyang exclaimed: “This is truly the stuff of immortals!” He gave him the religious name Mingzhen and the style Bixuzi, then taught him the oral instructions for the returning elixir and the flowing stream.\n\nAfter receiving these transmissions, Mingzhen let his hair grow wild and his face become grimy, begging for food to sustain himself. Sometimes he sang, sometimes he danced, feigning madness to mock the world—people called him “Yang the Madman.” He always carried a ladle as his drinking vessel, mingling with beggars at the city gates, remaining silent for years. His resolve was harder than metal or stone as he wandered between Mount Zhongnan and the Hu region.\n\nLater, learning that Danyang had ascended to immortality, he traveled east to the sea to make offerings at his master’s grave. He also visited Masters Changsheng and Yuyang, receiving much guidance from them. On his meandering journey west, he heard that Du Zhenyang, styled Zhenyangzi, of Jishan County had been approved by Danyang. Taking the route through Hebei, he burned incense and paid his respects. Du secretly imparted the essentials of the Dao and presented him with *Words of One Beyond the World*.\n\nMingzhen then returned to Qin. From that time on, all doubts and obstacles vanished. He entered the Xuan Zhao Hall before the capital’s provincial office, sat in silent absorption, and though the world’s splendor unfolded before him, he never once glanced at it. His heart turned to ashes, his body withered—after a dozen years in the mountains, he entered the great mystery.\n\nIn the *jiwei* year of the Cheng’an era (1200), Gao Deqing, the Transport Commissioner, suddenly suffered from heart pain, and no physician could cure him. As he lay on the verge of death, he dreamed that Mingzhen sprayed water into his mouth. His body broke into a sweat, and he suddenly revived. Within days, his limbs were restored to health. He personally visited the Xuan Zhao Hall, burned incense, and bowed in gratitude, offering gold and silk. Mingzhen refused them and instead composed ten quatrains to express his thanks.\n\nOn the Double Fifth Festival, Mingzhen was at Qingzhen Hermitage. He drew a furnace on the ground, gathered soil to use as incense, and a jade-green smoke rose in coils over a *zhang* high, forming a canopy that lingered for some time. Several cranes circled and cried above it as ten thousand eyes looked up in awe.\n\nThereafter, General Wanyan provided funds to build the present-day Danxia Abbey. An old man from Pucheng named Su suffered from stiff, crippled knees and could not walk. Mingzhen sprayed water into his mouth, and he was able to run as before.\n\nThereafter, villagers afflicted with illness flocked to seek his water. Finding their demands burdensome, Mingzhen spat a cup of water into a well, which resounded like thunder. From then on, the sick who drew and drank from it were all cured. To this day, it is called the Dharma Water Well.\n\nBefore long, he returned to his ancestral temple to live in seclusion, summoning his disciples to hold a vegetarian feast and gather the assembly. He transmitted the Dharma to Master Wuyu Zi Li and requested that Observer Bi Zhichang be entrusted with his place of retreat. He left behind a gatha:\n\nEighty years passed swift as lightning’s flash,\nA heap of stinking rot cast in a barren field.\nNow that I depart, no hindrance remains—\nCast off the hand, return to emptiness, and merge with the natural.\n\nSetting down his brush, he peacefully transformed. Song Zhaoran of Fushan, who had long been at odds with Mingzhen, was bidding him farewell outside the window when Song rushed out to greet him—just as word arrived that Mingzhen had ascended. This occurred on the eleventh day of the sixth lunar month in the *wuzǐ* year of the Zhengda era, at the age of seventy-nine. He left behind several hundred disciples, and his lifetime writings, titled *The Chang’an Collection*, circulated in the world. He was buried in the Immortal Shedding Garden of Liu and Jiang.\n\nIn the winter of the *gēngxū* year, the Preceptor Zhenchang, the Perfected of True Constancy, by imperial decree posthumously bestowed upon him the title Perfected of Azure Emptiness, Unyielding and Stalwart.\n\n**Master Zhou Quandao**\nMaster Zhou’s personal name was Quandao. His family had long been prominent in ancient Bin. He was born on the twenty-second day of the twelfth lunar month in the *yǐchǒu* year of the Huangtong era. From childhood, his speech and silence, his movements and stillness, were as those of a grown man. His appearance was strangely archaic, his demeanor refined and serene. Having lost his father early, his family’s livelihood was meager, yet he exerted himself to serve his mother. When she suddenly fell gravely ill, no treatment availed, so he cut flesh from his thigh, mixing it with medicine to offer her. Her illness then abated, and his filial piety became known throughout the village.\n\nWhen he came of age, a villager sought to betroth his daughter to him, but he gently declined. When his mother passed away, his grief was so profound it nearly extinguished his nature. He sighed, saying: “I have heard the Daoists say that if one child attains the Dao, nine generations of ancestors ascend as immortals. To repay her boundless kindness, nothing compares to this.”\n\nIn the *guǐsì* year of the Dading era, Master Danyang of the Quanzhen lineage resided at the ancestral temple on Mount Zhongnan, expounding the teachings of the Quanzhen school. Mingzhen then presented himself before him, seeking to receive the essentials of the Dao. Danyang accepted him, placing him among his disciples, and had him personally tend to tasks such as gathering firewood and hulling grain. Mingzhen served with reverence and diligence, never slackening for years. Observing his resolve to receive the Dao, Danyang one day summoned him into his chamber, transmitting to him the *Zhen’gao* and bestowing upon him the name Master Quanyang.\n\nHaving received the Dharma, Mingzhen disciplined himself and refined his mind, practicing what he had been taught. After several more years, the entire assembly marveled at the sincerity of his conduct. Soon after, Danyang said to him: “Bin lies near the frontier, where the transformative power of the teachings is difficult to spread. You should go and reside there to propagate our Dao.” Mingzhen accepted the instruction and went to establish a hermitage at the foot of Yufeng Mountain, where he nurtured his spirit and cultivated vastness. In teaching and transforming others, he adapted to each according to their roots, and all—whether of shallow or deep nature—received enlightenment. As for those afflicted with chronic illness, disability, or orphaned, widowed, and without recourse, he gathered and cared for them in the hermitage. Thus, the gentry and common folk of the village grew ever more respectful, and the people of Bin turned toward goodness.\n\nIn the *rényín* year, Danyang passed away. Thereafter, Mingzhen unfailingly journeyed to the ancestral temple each Clear and Bright Festival to offer sacrifices, making it an annual observance. During the Zhenyou era, when the Qiang people overran Bin, Mingzhen was among the captives. Though held in bondage, his devotion to the Dao never wavered. The Qiang, recognizing him as an extraordinary man, released him. Disciples came from all directions to receive his teachings, their numbers beyond counting. He instructed each to establish their own place of practice and guided those who came after.\n\nIn the final years of the Yuanguang era, Minister Zhang Xinpu, Left Assistant Director of the Secretariat, was appointed to govern Bin Prefecture. Having long been wary of Master Zhou’s reputation, he came directly to Jade Peak to inquire into his cultivation. The Master expounded to him the principles of the Dao, life, nature, and destiny. Delighted by his sincerity, the minister declared upon leaving, “Zhou Quanyang is a man of the Dao.” The next day, he hosted a vegetarian feast, presented the Master with a robe and shoes, and thereafter frequently sent attendants to inquire after his well-being. The Master, in turn, often traveled to and fro, residing at the Temple of Emperor Gaozu of Han in Chang’an, where General Wanyan treated him with the reverence due a teacher.\n\nIn the *wùzǐ* year of the Zhengda era, he returned once more to Bin. On the seventeenth day of the tenth month, he unexpectedly instructed his disciples to prepare a feast. Summoning his dharma heir, Yuanmingzi Li Zhiyuan, he entrusted him, saying: “Nanshi Village in the Zhongnan Mountains was the place where the Patriarch first spread the teachings and refined the truth. I wish to restore and expand it to honor the immortal legacy, but the times are such that it cannot be forced. When peace returns in days to come, you and your fellow disciples must strive to fulfill this aspiration.” With these words, he ordered his attendant to light incense and directed the assembly to recite the *Qingjing Jing*. Seated upright in solemn attention, he listened as the sutra was chanted three times, then leaned his head upon his left arm and passed away at the age of eighty-four. He was buried beside Jade Peak Hermitage.\n\nA scholar named Wang Caiqing, who shared a deep bond with the Master, was then serving in Qingyang. As the imperial troops besieged the city with great urgency, Wang suddenly dreamed of the Master arriving in ethereal grace, saying: “I have come especially to bid you farewell. This floating life is but a fleeting lodging—cling not to it overlong. Once this body is lost, to regain it would be most difficult.” With these words, he departed. Soon after, the siege was lifted, and Wang inquired among others, only to learn that the day of the Master’s appearance in his dream was the very day he had returned to the truth. Thereupon, Wang resigned his office, renounced his wife and children, and devoted himself to the Dao for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn the *wùwǔ* year of the Cheng’an era, a man from Zoucheng County in Donglu named Zhang Zhiyuan, styled Dongxuzi, twice dreamed of divine beings brandishing white blades, rebuking him: “Your years are nearly spent—why do you not seek a master and study the Dao to avoid an untimely death?” Awakening in a daze, he wandered to the western outskirts of the city, where he suddenly encountered a Daoist in hempen robes and straw sandals, his frame tall and imposing, approaching from the west. The Daoist addressed Zhang, saying: “You possess deep karmic affinity, and so I have come to receive you.” There by the roadside, he imparted the secret instructions of inner cultivation and presented him with a hempen sash, adding: “Hold this in reverence and never forget my teachings. Thirty years hence, a disciple of my lineage will come here to meet you, and at that time, you shall form a profound karmic bond with the true master.” When Zhang asked his name, he replied: “I am Zhou Quanyang of Guanzhong.” Then he vanished. Zhang thereupon changed his attire and entered the Daoist path. Later, in Jizhou, he established the Baiyun Abbey, ordaining hundreds of disciples and founding hermitages and temples throughout the Qi and Lu regions.\n\nIn the *rénchén* year, when the Six Armies advanced into Henan, Li Yuanming led his followers north across the river and settled in Qi’e County, where they built the Qizhen Abbey. Hearing of this, Zhang traveled to pay his respects and recounted the circumstances of his earlier encounter with the Master. Yuanming produced a portrait of the Master, and Zhang, burning incense and bowing deeply, exclaimed: “This is indeed the master I met before!” He acknowledged Yuanming as his elder in the Dao.\n\nIn the *yǐwèi* year, when Guanzhong was pacified, Yuanming, mindful of the Master’s final instructions, led a hundred disciples of the lineage back west and established a grand Daoist temple in Nanshi. Zhang Dongxu and others contributed gold and silk to support the endeavor. Within a decade, the magnificent structure stood complete, its grandeur and openness a sight to behold.\n\nIn the *xīnchǒu* spring, the Qinghe Perfected One commanded his disciples to inter the Master’s remains in the Immortals’ Burial Ground at Liujiang. In the *rénzǐ* year, the Perfected Master of the True Constant, Li, by imperial decree posthumously bestowed upon him the title “Quanyang, Perfected One of Vast Virtue and Vast Transformation.”\n\n---\n\nMaster Qiao Qiandao was a native of Pingyang, of the Qiao clan, named Qiandao and styled Chongxuzi. By nature serene and contemplative, he had long been drawn to the mysteries of the Dao. In the *rényín* year of the Dading era, at the age of thirty-six, he journeyed to Zhongnan with his fellow villager Li Chongdao to pay homage to Master Danyang, seeking to receive the teachings of the Quanzhen school. They resided at the ancestral temple in Liujiang, gathering firewood and drawing water to serve the Daoist community. Though they endured hardships without respite, they never faltered in their devotion.\n\nOne day, Danyang imparted to him the profound instructions and presented him with two quatrains:\n\n*Content with fate, untroubled by poverty,*\n*He bears the jade within, his heart and mind unlike the crowd.*\n*Refining the elixir depends on the craftsman’s hand—*\n*Let the cauldron’s frost and snow turn crimson red.*\n\n*The Dao’s mysteries—with whom to fathom them?*\n*Only when meeting a kindred spirit do words align.*\n*Guard the black, lest the heart grow dark,*\n*For the cinnabar’s glow outshines the face’s bloom.*\n\nHaving received these teachings, Master Qiao and his fellow disciple Li devoted themselves to rigorous cultivation, their diligence in the Dao spanning over a decade, enabling them to penetrate its deepest mysteries. In the *rényín* year, when Danyang passed away, the two masters traveled together, harmonizing their voices and waters, begging for alms to sustain themselves. Later, the Minister of Revenue, Liu Haojian, remarked to others: “In ancient times, Liezi dwelled in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet none knew him as a man of the Dao. Those who embrace the Dao and hold fast to virtue are like merchants who conceal their finest wares, fearing discovery. I observe that Masters Qiao and Li are of this same lineage.” The villagers, upon hearing this, grew ever more respectful. They selected a site in the northeastern corner of the old city and built the Taiqing Abbey to honor them.\n\nIn the *bǐngwǔ* year, when Master Changchun propagated the teachings at the ancestral temple, the two masters came to sit among his disciples, daily receiving his instructions. Changchun, perceiving their steadfastness, suddenly declared to the assembly: “Masters Qiao and Li are diligent in the Dao—truly the most accomplished in my lineage.” From that time, their reputation in the Dao grew ever higher.\n\nIn the *xīnhài* year of the Mingchang era, at Changchun’s behest, they jointly spread the teachings in Hedong, establishing the Chongxu Abbey in Linfen. In the *réntù* year of the Taihe era, they returned to Heshui, residing at the Qizhen Abbey to receive and guide others. In the *dīngchǒu* spring of the Zhenyou era, during the third month, as he sat conversing with the scholar Wang Keda, he suddenly said: “I would trouble you with a small request—would you provide a robe to see me on my way?”\n\nWithin days, he passed away without illness at the age of eighty-one. Only then did Wang Keda, arriving to offer condolences, realize that the robe he had requested was meant for his coffin.\n\nAt the time, his disciple Li Daoyin was residing elsewhere. One day, a certain master suddenly appeared at his door, offering private instruction. As he took his leave, he added: “Come again tomorrow—I have something further to entrust to you.” The next day, as Daoyin was en route, he encountered someone who reported that the master had already ascended in transcendence the day before. Only then did he understand that the visitor had been a manifestation beyond the physical form.\n\n**Li Chongdao**\nMaster Li, styled Chongdao, was also known by the sobriquet Qingxuzi. His family hailed from Pingyang. Of resolute character and skilled in literary composition, he served his parents with filial devotion. In the *rénchén* year of the Dading era, as he approached forty, he formed a bond of profound friendship with Qiao Qiandao of the same village. Together, they journeyed to the Zhongnan Mountains in Shaanxi to seek the teachings of Master Danyang of the Quanzhen lineage. Seeing their potential, the master kept them among his disciples, where they labored for years—pounding grain, sweeping floors—growing ever more reverent with time. One day, he imparted secret instructions and presented them with a poem:\n\n*Beyond the world’s cares, boundless delight,*\n*Yet blending with the dust, harmonizing light.*\n*Alas, floating clouds—empty, fleeting dreams,*\n*Like withered leaves dancing in autumn’s gleam.*\n\n*Let others mock the Daoist’s humble state,*\n*Unshaken in resolve, apart from common fate.*\n*In the cavern’s depths, frost and snow descend,*\n*Yet the seed of wisdom blooms anew, its hues transcend.*\n\nHaving received the master’s affirmation, Chongdao devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Dao, sitting in meditation without reclining for nearly a decade, until his mind became as vast as the heavens. In the Taiding era, he suddenly beheld a divine radiance illuminating his chamber, bright as daylight. With Qiao, he then traveled to Heyang, where they begged for alms, cultivated their conduct, and propagated the true teachings.\n\nIn the *bǐngwǔ* year, when Changchun returned from Mount Long to the ancestral sanctuary, Chongdao again attended his seat, advancing in the supreme Dao. By the *xīnhài* year of the Mingchang era, as Changchun prepared to journey east, he commanded Chongdao and Qiao to spread the teachings in Hedong. They established the Chongxu Abbey west of Linfen County, ordaining hundreds of disciples and founding dozens of hermitages and abbeys. Through songs and verses, Chongdao subtly revealed the profound principles of the Dao. Qiao admonished him: “A Daoist should conceal his light and remain obscure. Now that a true master of the highest order is still in the world, we must each advance in the authentic Dao.” Chongdao acknowledged his words and burned his writings.\n\nOne day, he ordered his disciples to prepare a bath and said: “My worldly ties are now severed. Today, I shall return.” He entrusted them with final instructions on the pursuit of the Dao, then peacefully departed. Neither smoke nor mist, yet a fragrant haze enveloped the courtyard for three days. All who witnessed it—scholars and commoners alike—marveled. He was interred at Chongxu Abbey, where a hall and statue were erected to honor his memory.\n\n**Zhao Jiugu**\nMaster Zhao, whose given name was Jiugu and Daoist name Xujingzi, was born into a family of officials in Tanzhou. His ancestors had served in succession, earning distinction in governance. His father, a prefect of Zizhou, was later transferred to serve as vice-prefect of Pingdong, where the family settled.\n\nJiugu was born in the third year of the Dading era, the *guǐwèi* year. Of serene and refined disposition, a fortune-teller once remarked: “His bearing is pure, his bones extraordinary—he cannot be confined to the dust of the world.” Having lost his father early, he harbored aspirations of transcending the mundane. In the seventeenth year of his life, the *dīngyǒu* year, his mother wished to arrange his marriage, but he refused. Repeatedly, he sought to enter the Daoist path. Though his mother reproached him, she recognized the steadfastness of his resolve and eventually consented.\n\nHearing of a certain Cui Yangtou in the prefecture who was accomplished in the Dao, he went to study under him. Cui assigned him to kitchen duties, often demanding that he prepare five to seven meals each night, only to change the required flavors each time. Yet Cui neither ate much nor allowed excess preparation, forcing Jiugu to remain awake through the night. For three years, his reverence deepened, and not a trace of arrogance remained. Others referred to him as “the inner attendant.” Cui, recognizing his worth, in the nineteenth year, the *jǐhài* year, sent him to study under Danyang in Huating. Danyang accepted him.\n\nIn the *gēngzǐ* year, Danyang returned to Zhongnan and instructed Jiugu to serve Changchun at Longmen, personally guiding his training. Changchun, who had taken the name Daojian, frequently traveled to Pingdong. In the *bǐngwǔ* year, Changchun brought him to the ancestral sanctuary in Zhongnan. (Changchun had received the imperial summons in the *wùshēn* year.) There, he left Jiugu to serve Master Lingyang Li.\n\nIn the *xīnhài* year of the Mingchang era, as Changchun journeyed east to the sea, he passed through Yecheng and commanded Jiugu to pay respects to Changsheng. Shortly after, Changsheng sent Jiugu to reside at Qixia Abbey. Changchun, pleased by his arrival, appointed him as his literary attendant, entrusting him with the management of scriptures and teachings. Whenever officials, scholars, or Daoist followers came to pay their respects, they were required to first meet with Jiugu before entering the master’s chamber.\n\nHis writings were elegant and archaic, his calligraphy reminiscent of the *Huaihe Ming*. In the *jǐmǎo* year, as Changchun received the imperial summons to journey to the Western Regions, Jiugu was chosen as the foremost among his attendants. Upon reaching Sailan City, he said to Minister Qinghe Yin: “When I reach Xuande, I sense the signs of my departure. As the master once instructed, a Daoist should not be troubled by life or death—what is there to fear? You must all serve the true master well.” With these words, he passed away at the age of fifty-nine. He was buried on the eastern plain outside the city, and to this day, the locals venerate his memory.\n\nInitially, when Changchun passed through Mount Abuhan, he left Song Dao’an and eight others to establish Qixia Abbey and await his return. In the *rénwǔ* year, a malicious man named Tuoji incited a lawsuit, causing great distress among the disciples. One day, as Dao’an napped, he saw Jiugu descend through the skylight and say: “A letter from my master has arrived.” Dao’an asked: “From where?” Jiugu replied: “From the heavens.” Upon receiving it, he saw only the two characters *Taiqing*. When Dao’an shared this with the others, a letter indeed arrived the next day from the imperial court, and the lawsuit was resolved. This was Jiugu’s unseen protection.\n\nIn the *guǐwèi* year, as Changchun returned east and passed Jiugu’s grave, his companions wished to exhume and transport his remains. Changchun stopped them, saying: “The four elements are but a borrowed form, destined to be discarded. Only the true nature of the spirit remains unbound and free.”\n\nWhy cling so stubbornly to thoughts of that discarded form? The next day, they pressed onward, and upon reaching the lands of Han, in over ten places—from Yunzhong’s Wuchuan to Jinyang, Yan, and Ji—Changchun beheld the master arriving alone on horseback, foretelling the return of the Patriarch Changchun from the east and asking why none had come to greet him from afar. Such marvels of his spirit were too numerous to record in full; here, only one or two are noted to show that though he died, he did not perish.\n\nIn the *gēngxū* year, the Perfected Zhenchang, by imperial command, bestowed honors upon the Daoist masters for their virtue. The master was posthumously granted the title *Zhongzhen Xujiao Xuanying Perfected*, and his cap and shoes were interred on Wuhua Mountain to be venerated in annual rites.\n\nMaster Taoyanming was a native of Xiangling County in Pingyang. From childhood, he loved the Dao and was known for his filial devotion to his parents. After the age of thirty, he lost both his parents. Grieving deeply, he observed mourning beyond the prescribed rites. With resolve, he set aside his family burdens and crossed the river southward to reside in Lingbao County, seeking a master to study the Dao but unsure where to turn. In the *guǐsì* year of the Dading era, Xu Zijing of Hejian arrived as the county magistrate. Seeing the master’s pure and upright character, he said: “If you truly aspire to follow the Dao and cultivate immortality, you must find a teacher—otherwise, you will waste your years in vain. I have heard that Master Ma Danyang of the Quanzhen tradition now resides on Mount Zhongnan. You should seek him out.” He even composed a poem to send him on his way. The master then traveled directly to Liujiang, where Danyang, upon meeting him, seemed to share a bond from a past life. He kept him by his side, bestowing the name *Yanming* and the courtesy name *Mingfu*. After many days of close instruction, Danyang taught him the principles of *xing* and *ming*. Through constant guidance, morning and night, the master’s mind became clear and unobstructed. Danyang then sent him to travel and visit various places to investigate the state before his parents’ birth.\n\nThe master settled in Weinan, living on simple fare. He practiced what he had received from his teacher as if it were his lifelong path. Before many years had passed, Danyang summoned him back to the ancestral court and questioned him on his daily practice. Sighing, he said: “Pure and unadulterated—surely it is only Taoyanming.” He then granted him the title *Wumingzi* (“Nameless One”). Soon after, Danyang prepared to return east, and the master also left the pass, dwelling first on Baodu Mountain west of Luoyang before moving to reside in seclusion on Taohua Mountain. Over twenty years later, he suddenly told his disciples: “Yesterday, in meditation, I recalled that in a past life I once lived in Lingguang Cave, but now I cannot find its location.” Later, while traveling to Mount Nüji, he saw a stone wall inscribed with the three characters *Lingguang Cave*. Inside, the stone forest and iron mortar were still there, so he restored the cave and made it his home. His disciples verified his words and held him in even greater reverence. After more than ten years in seclusion, he abruptly moved to Changyuan, his intentions known to none.\n\nWithin days, northern troops ravaged Mount Nüji, and many civilians suffered calamity—yet not a single horseman came to Changyuan. The people marveled all the more at the master’s foresight. Though his years were advanced, his steps remained firm, his spirit bright and clear, a testament to his lifelong cultivation. In the autumn of the *bingxu* year of the Zhengda era, disciples Di Baoyuan and Wang Baozhen of Yunxi Hermitage invited the master to spend the winter there. He declined, saying, “I have already made arrangements for the winter here. Come spring, I shall go to you and make it my place of retirement.” On the sixth day of the third month in the *dinghai* year, he arrived at Yunxi Hermitage with staff in hand, laughing and conversing with the Daoist assembly all day. The next morning, he changed into fresh robes, sat upright, and asked for paper and brush to write a hymn. Then, in an instant, he passed away at the age of eighty-six. His coffin remained in state for seven days; his cheeks retained their color, his crown remained warm, as though he were in deep slumber. He was interred in the quiet chamber where he had lived, and the following year, Master Lifeng Yu buried him west of Fengyi Mountain. When the coffin was opened, his form remained unchanged, and a fragrant breeze filled the valley. Tens of thousands came to pay their respects, all marveling in wonder. Thus, Left Minister Yao Shu composed an epitaph to record these marvels.\n\nMaster Wang Zhida, a native of Yan’an from the great clan of Wang, bore the name Zhida and the Daoist title Xuantongzi. He was born on the twenty-ninth day of the tenth month in the *gengwu* year of the Tiande era. Orphaned of his father in childhood, he possessed a refined discernment from a young age and often lamented the illusory nature of worldly affairs, harboring a heart that longed to transcend the mundane. In adulthood, due to his prosperous household, he served as village headman, collecting taxes with fairness and integrity, earning the respect of his community. In the *dingyou* year of the Dading era, a friend fell ill and, after several days, his body transformed into a great serpent—only his head and face remained unchanged. The master examined him, and the friend said, “Prepare a basket and take me to the mountains, lest my head and face also transform and harm the living.” The master lifted the cover for a closer look; from the neck down, his friend had indeed become a python. He and the family carried him to the foot of the mountain, where he slithered into the grass and vanished. The master was deeply shaken and left home, never to return. On the road, he encountered a stranger who imparted to him the mysteries of the Dao, saying, “Now, Master Danyang is teaching and transforming on Zhongnan Mountain. You should go and study under him.” The stranger then disappeared. The master went directly to Zhongnan and sought initiation. At first, Danyang refused him, even subjecting him to days of scolding and humiliation, but his resolve only grew stronger. Moved by his sincerity, Danyang allowed him to stay and serve among the disciples, teaching him to endure humiliation and refine his heart. After several years, his diligence, frugality, humility, and devotion deepened with time. Before long, Danyang entrusted him with the essentials of virtue, nature, and life. Having received the transmission, the master retired to a humble abode in Yunyang County. For thirteen years, he sat in silent meditation until the light of his heart shone forth within, manifesting as verses that harmonized with the profound principles of the Dao. He guided hundreds of disciples. Later, he returned to Yan’an.\n\nIn the fifth month, during a great drought, officials and commoners asked the master when rain would come. He replied, “Today there will be light rain, but it will not be enough. After three more days, the moisture will be abundant.” On the appointed day, his words proved true. During the Taihe era, when Qiang raiders invaded, the people were seized with fear. The master calmly said, “Have no concern. Yesterday, in meditation, I saw three thousand headless men driving five hundred great beasts here.” Several days later, a victory dispatch arrived: three thousand enemy heads had been taken, and over five hundred camels captured. News of this spread, and reverence for the master grew even greater.\n\nOne day, while taking a modest drink at a market tavern, he stepped outside to gaze at the heavens, then returned to his seat. Requesting paper and brush, he wrote a hymn:\n\n*A single red sun blazes at the sky’s center,\nFive-colored auspicious clouds swirl above its crown.\nTake heed—with one cry, I depart,\nRiding backward on a dark crane to the eastern sea’s edge.*\n\nHe cast aside the brush, curled his arm beneath his head, and passed away. This occurred on the second day of the twelfth month in the *gengwu* year of the Da’an era, at the hour of noon. He was sixty-one years of age.\n\nHis writings, titled *The Mystic Communion Collection*, circulated in the world. He was buried southeast of the prefectural city. After the fall of the Tianxing regime, his disciples built the Mystic Communion Abbey at his burial site to maintain the incense offerings.\n\nMaster Xue Zhiwei was a native of Hejin County in Hebei, a distant descendant of Tang General Xue Rengui, who had campaigned against Liao. His religious name was Zhiwei, his courtesy name Daoyuan, and his sobriquet the Azure Firmament Master. Born in the *gengwu* year of the Tiande era, he showed no interest in childish play from youth, preferring solitude and silence. As he neared adulthood, he developed a fervent passion for the study of nurturing life and destiny.\n\nIn the *xinmao* year of the Dading era, Master Danyang of the Quanzhen School expounded the teachings on Mount Zhongnan, his reputation resounding far and wide. The master then renounced his wife and children, respectfully sought his presence, and served as a gatekeeper, wielding the whisk to attend upon him. For three years, his devotion remained unwavering. Danyang recognized him as a vessel for the Dao and transmitted to him the secret instructions for cultivating truth.\n\nHaving received the transmission, the master returned to his hometown, where he built a hermitage to dwell in stillness, regulating his *qi* and nourishing his spirit. After six years of such practice, his mind became profoundly settled, and his nature grew clear and luminous. In the *xinchou* year, he journeyed again to the ancestral court to present himself before his teacher and advance in the Dao.\n\nOne evening, the sky was clear and the moon bright. He rose, gathered firewood, and placed it beneath the eaves. The others marveled at his eccentricity, but by dawn, snow had accumulated a foot deep. All then admired his mastery of tranquil concentration, which allowed him to perceive what had not yet come to pass.\n\nIn the *guimao* year, two or three fellow Daoists invited him to travel to Mount Tiantan. The master said, “I have long wished to visit the Wangwu Grotto-Heaven. The ‘Nest of Peace’ there would make a fine lodging.” Upon arrival, the host welcomed them and offered a chamber—spacious, elegant, and adorned with a plaque reading *Nest of Peace*. His companions exchanged glances and sighed, “Truly, the master is a man of the Dao.”\n\nAt that time, Danyang had returned east to the sea. In winter, his Dharma brother Wang Zhi wished to travel to Ninghai to visit their teacher. As they parted, the master wept bitterly, though none could fathom the reason. When Wang reached Ninghai, Danyang had already ascended in transformation twenty days prior.\n\nShortly after, the master returned to his hometown. When Wang Rulin came to visit, the master said, “Why did you not seek a skilled physician to treat your illness in its early stages?” Wang, then in good health, paid no heed to his words. Yet before a month had passed, he suddenly suffered a stroke and died.\n\nWhen Chongqing inquired of the scholar Wu Shijie and Xue Guobao about the autumn examination topics, the master replied, “The Three Kings brought peace through rewards and punishments.” When the time came, both men indeed passed the examination.\n\nAnother day, a certain Du Zhongmin came to the hermitage for idle conversation. The master smiled and said, “You should return home at once—your wife, fallen into a well, may yet be saved.” Du rushed home in alarm, and the matter proved just as the master had foretold. Such were his precognitions, all of which came to pass without exception.\n\nLater, he crossed the river southward and wandered among the Song and Shaoshi mountains. Seeking a quieter place, he moved to Neixiang, where he was drawn to the simplicity and beauty of the people. There he built a thatched hut and lived in seclusion, guiding many along the Way. In the winter of the *renchen* year of the Zhengda era (1232), on the third day of the tenth month, he passed away without illness, having lived eighty-three springs and autumns.\n\nHis collected poems and lyrics were titled *The Pure and Empty Collection*. Among his hundreds of disciples, only four—Hou Zhi’en, Liu Zhichun, Tang Zhi’an, and Fan Zhichong—were deemed advanced enough to enter his inner chamber. All four established temples and initiated others into the Dao in Heyang and Yunying, becoming eminent masters of their generation.\n\nAfter the war, the master’s remains were moved and interred beneath Zhongnan Mountain at the Youxian Palace’s Jizhen Hall in Hu County. The Celestial Master Zhenchang, Li Jun, by imperial decree, posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Ascended Perfected of the Mysterious and True*.\n\n---\n\n**Chen Zhiming**\nThe master’s surname was Chen, his given name Zhiming, and his Daoist name Chaozhenzi. A native of Yuan Village in Zhongnan County, he lived next door to Liu Jiang. The Patriarch Chongyang repeatedly sought to convert and guide him, but the master, though wealthy, could not yet abandon worldly entanglements.\n\nLater, when the Four Perfected—Danyang and his companions—came to reside at the ancestral hermitage, the master’s heart inclined toward the Dao. One day, the Patriarch Danyang presented him with a green cloth headwrap and composed a poem:\n\n*A green cloud unfurls to enfold you,*\n*Gazing at you, Chen, I see your destined share.*\n*I hope we may share the same bond,*\n*That you and I may together delight in freedom.*\n*On the path to immortality, seek the golden crucible;*\n*In the land of undying light, gather jade sprouts.*\n*Why settle for transcending only yourself?*\n*Let nine generations of ancestors ascend to the cinnabar heavens.*\n\nMoved by this guidance, the master sighed, “In the past, Chongyang repeatedly sought to convert me, but my foolishness kept me from following his lofty path. If my allotted time should come, how could these meager merits extend my life by even a day?” That very day, he bowed to Danyang as his teacher, changed his robes, and entered the Dao.\n\nDanyang, recognizing the master’s administrative talents, appointed him steward of the ancestral hermitage, where he accumulated merit through virtuous deeds. For a decade, he saved lives through medicine and healing, amassing abundant hidden virtue. Many in the community relied on his protection and shade.\n\nDanyang often composed poems and lyrics to instruct the master in the cultivation of truth through stillness, leading him to profound realization. Later, the master retired and lived in leisure. Danyang appointed Lü Dao’an to succeed him as hermitage steward, while the master devoted himself entirely to spiritual refinement.\n\nIn the *dingsi* year of the Cheng’an era (1207), he suddenly placed his hand on Lü’s back and said, “Your karmic potential is vast. When this hermitage becomes a temple, you will initiate hundreds of Daoists as disciples. At that time, our Way will flourish, and you will be at its heart. Tend well to yourself—I shall soon depart.” With these words, he bid farewell to his companions, then peacefully transformed, living to the age of eighty-one.\n\nHis coffin remained unburied for three days. His body remained supple, and his eyes retained their luster. The following year, the Patriarch Yuyang purchased the ancestral hermitage and established it as the Lingxu Temple. By imperial favor, Lü Dao’an was granted the title *Master of Sublime Emptiness* and entrusted with managing the temple’s affairs and ordination certificates. Later, he indeed initiated nearly three hundred Daoists—just as the master had foretold.\n\n---\n\n**Song Mingyi**\nThe master’s surname was Song, his given name Mingyi, and his Daoist name Zhaoranzi. A native of Fushan County in Dengzhou, his grandfather and father had served as county clerks, earning renown in their village for their integrity and fairness.\n\nFrom childhood, the master studied Confucian classics and excelled in literature. Yet he found the world unworthy of attachment and resolved to leave it behind to study the Dao. In his thirtieth year, he bid farewell to his parents and elders and journeyed directly to Guanzhong. There he took refuge under the Patriarch Danyang, enduring countless trials with a will as unyielding as metal and stone.\n\nIn his spare moments from serving his teacher, he devoted himself to cultivating truth and practicing stillness, progressing daily. Danyang transmitted oral instructions to him and bestowed upon him a green *Yang* headwrap. The master received it with reverence, treasuring his teacher’s gift for the rest of his life. Each morning and on the first and fifteenth days of the month, he would don it, bowing in homage to the Perfected and the Sages.\n\nIn the spring of the *renyin* year of the Dading era (1212), Danyang’s crane-borne carriage returned eastward. The master accompanied him to the sea, where he persuaded his mother, brother, sister, and nephew—six in all—to take refuge under Danyang and enter the Dao.\n\nThe following winter, Danyang ascended as an immortal. The master returned to Guanzhong and resided at the ancestral hermitage. In the *bingwu* year (1206), he led a group to Long Mountain to invite the Patriarch Changchun to return to Zhongnan and propagate the ancestral teachings.\n\nIn the *xinhai* year of the Mingchang era (1191), Changchun’s immortal procession also journeyed eastward. The master received his instructions and was appointed a senior elder of the ancestral hermitage. Thereafter, all who entered the Dao were guided by him as their initiating master.\n\nIn the *bingxu* year of the Zhida era (1316), northern troops advanced, and the people of Qin Chuan were thrown into panic. Many fled to the southern mountains, and the Daoist community took refuge in Migu Valley. The master alone refused to go. When others urged him to flee, he replied, “Where can I escape my karmic debts? You may go—I will remain here to guard this place.”\n\nWithin days, scouting soldiers arrived. The halls of Lingxu Temple were reduced to ashes, and the master was slain. The next day, when the Daoist community descended the mountain to inspect the site, they found his body unmarred, his blood unspilled—a true body of pure yang, akin to those of Xi Kang or Luo Gongyuan. It was the thirteenth day of the tenth month, and he had lived eighty-four years.\n\nIn the spring of the *renzǐ* year of the Zhi Da era (1312), the Celestial Master Zhenchang, Li Jun, by imperial decree, posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of Carefree Truth*.\n\n---\n\n**Lü Dao’an**\nThe master’s surname was Lü, his given name Dao’an. His family had long been prominent in Ninghai. From childhood, he was perceptive and aspired to the mysterious Way.\n\nHis bearing was that of an immortal, his bones those of a Daoist adept—such gifts were bestowed by nature. He served his parents with filial devotion, renowned throughout his village. At just thirty-two, both parents passed away. After performing the burial rites, he renounced the secular world and entered the Dao.\n\nAt that time, the four masters Ma, Tan, Qiu, and Liu were guarding the tombs on Mount Zhongnan. The master journeyed west alone and paid homage to Master Danyang of the lineage, who hailed from the same village. Knowing the Lü family to be of pure and noble lineage, Danyang had him serve at his side. After years of cultivation, he came to comprehend the subtleties of the Dao.\n\nIn the *gēngzǐ* year of the Dading era (1180), Danyang appointed him abbot of the ancestral temple cloister, where he nurtured the Daoist community. During this time, Master Lingyang Li was still alive, and the master benefited greatly from his guidance. In the *bǐngwǔ* year (1186), Master Changchun of the Longmen lineage arrived at the ancestral temple. Over several years, the master daily received his profound teachings, resolving all doubts and obstacles.\n\nIn the *xīnhài* year of the Mingchang era (1191), when Changchun’s immortal retinue departed, the master cultivated himself with reverence, honored the community, and upheld the Daoist ethos with the same devotion as when his teachers were alive. In the *yǐmǎo* year (1195), after the imperial court’s inspection concluded without granting an official plaque, the cloisters were all seized by the authorities, the ancestral temple among them. From then on, the gates stood desolate, and the Daoist teachings waned.\n\nIn the *dīngsì* year of the Cheng’an era (1207), Perfected Yuyang was summoned to the capital. He dispatched someone to invite the master. The following spring, the master arrived in Yanjing, where Yuyang had purchased the ancestral temple and established it as Lingxu Abbey. He then bestowed upon the master the title *Master of Penetrating Emptiness* and appointed him to oversee the abbey’s affairs, entrusting him with the imperial decrees. He said, “Master Chongyang walked thousands of miles on foot to transform us. It was all for the future of the teaching. Though I cannot go back and forth myself, how could I forget your deep ties to the ancestral temple? Uphold it well.” He also presented him with a poem:\n\n*Great awakening shines with majestic light across the vast sky,*\n*The true瑞 of prior heaven arrives in an instant.*\n*Emptiness and purity endure through all ages,*\n*The supreme Dao flows forth from the true ancestors.*\n*The three realms and ten directions unite as one,*\n*Countless scriptures and discourses reveal boundless truth.*\n*Transcending emotion, the Lord of Heaven’s Origin appears,*\n*Emerging beyond the transformations of yin and yang.*\n\nReturning west to the ancestral temple, the master revived its former glory. Within a few years, those who purchased ordination as Daoists all took him as their teacher. Some three hundred received ordination certificates, and dozens of abbeys were established in Shaanxi.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the second month in the *xīnsì* year of the Xingding era (1221), he instructed his disciples on the path of cultivation. He appointed his dharma brother Bi Zhichang to succeed him as abbot. Then, in perfect harmony, he passed away at the age of eighty. He was buried beside the immortals’ tombs of his teachers.\n\nIn the spring of the *rénzǐ* year of the Zhi Da era (1312), the Celestial Master Zhenchang, Li Jun, by imperial decree, posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of Congealed Emptiness*.\n\n---\n\n**Bi Zhichang**\nThe master’s surname was Bi, his given name Zhichang. His family had long been prominent in Liquan of Qianzhou. He was one of four brothers, all of whom were devoted to the study of purity and non-action.\n\nIn the *rénchén* year of the Dading era (1172), hearing that Master Danyang was propagating the true teaching at the ancestral temple cloister on Mount Zhongnan, he and his brothers came to join his assembly and left the household life. Danyang imparted secret instructions to each and, in stages, presented them with poems and lyrics to guide their progress. All attained profound mastery of the Dao’s mysteries, becoming eminent teachers of humans and gods—though the master was the youngest. He was kept at Danyang’s side, performing menial tasks. Day and night, he received instruction, and over time, he grasped the essentials of cultivating body and nature.\n\nIn the summer of the *rényín* year (1182), Danyang departed for the east. He instructed the master to enter the Long Mountains in the west to serve Master Changchun Qiu, gathering firewood and drawing water for five years. During moments of respite, he sat in solemn stillness through the night, cultivating the practice of tranquil concentration.\n\nIn the *xīnhài* year of the Mingchang era (1191), when Changchun’s immortal retinue departed, he left the master and Lü Dao’an to jointly oversee the ancestral cloister. Though Lü was his elder brother in the Dao, the master treated him with the respect due a teacher.\n\nIn the *yǐmǎo* year (1195), the court’s new policies seized the ancestral cloister for lack of an imperial plaque. In the *dīngsì* year of the Cheng’an era (1207), the master traveled to the coast to visit the various lineage masters. Changchun gave him all his possessions and even composed a petition himself, urging the master to seek alms and rebuild the temple.\n\nThe following spring, the master journeyed to Yanjing. At that time, Yuyang was serving at court and summoned Lü Dao’an to the capital, where he purchased the ancestral temple and established it as Lingxu Abbey. He then bestowed upon the master the title *Master of Communing with the True* and appointed him deputy abbot. Together with Lü, he returned west to the ancestral temple, renewing its Daoist ethos.\n\nThe master was particularly skilled in medicine and healing. Upon hearing of someone’s illness, he would go to their aid without regard for wealth or poverty. In the *xīnsì* year of the Xingding era (1221), Lü Dao’an ascended as an immortal, and the master succeeded him in tending the incense fire at Lingxu Abbey. He oversaw the construction and renovation of many halls, corridors, and cloisters, greatly expanding the Daoist community. Within a few years, he ordained over a hundred disciples.\n\nBefore long, he retired from abbatial duties and withdrew to the Dongzhen Abbey in the Five Surnames area of Qishan County, where he lived in harmony with the world while nurturing his true nature. Occasionally, he would visit Lingxu Abbey to oversee its affairs.\n\nIn the *xīnmǎo* year of the Zhengda era (1231), when war reached Guanzhong, the master fled with the local people to a gorge on Mount Taibai. On the sixteenth day of the third month, he told his disciples, “Yesterday, in meditation, the mountain spirits secretly informed me that this place is no longer safe. We must move elsewhere. The state of the world is such that I cannot bear to witness it.” He then burned incense and bid farewell to the sacred. The next morning, he passed away peacefully. His disciples buried him in the stone chamber where he had lived.\n\nSome locals who heeded his warning and left survived, while those who stayed perished when the soldiers arrived.\n\nIn the winter of the *gēngzǐ* year of the Yuan era (1240), Perfected Dongzhen Yu Jun, by imperial decree, came to reside at the ancestral temple. Recalling that the master had emerged from Danyang’s lineage and had been his close friend, he addressed the assembly, saying, “Master Bi of Communing with the True lived here for fifty years, greatly expanding the ancestral teaching. He was truly a great adept of our lineage.” He then ordered his disciples to exhume the master’s remains and rebury them beside the immortals’ tombs of Liu and Jiang.\n\nIn the spring of the *rénzǐ* year (1252), the Perfected Zhenchang Li, then in charge of the teaching, by imperial decree posthumously bestowed upon the master the title \"Perfected of Vast Containment.\"\n\n*The Inner Biographies of the Perfected Immortals of the Ancestral Court of Mount Zhongnan, Volume the Middle* concludes.\n*The Inner Biographies of the Perfected Immortals of the Ancestral Court of Mount Zhongnan, Volume the Lower*\nCompiled by Li Daoqian, the Heavenly Music Daoist of Yi Mountain\n\nThe Perfected of Pure Harmony—his family name was Yin, his given name Zhiping, and his courtesy name Dahe. His distant ancestors resided in Cangzhou, and during the former Song dynasty, one held office in Laizhou, where the family settled. His great-great-grandmother bore seven sons, all of whom passed the imperial examinations and became prefects, five of them attaining the rank of prefectural governor. His great-grandfather Gongzhi and his grandfather Hongyi both concealed their virtue and did not seek renown.\n\nIn the ninth year of the Dading era (1169), on the twentieth day of the first month, the master was born. That night, his mother dreamed of an extraordinary procession in splendid attire entering her chamber. Startled from her sleep, she awoke to find the master already born. The villagers exclaimed in alarm, \"Fire at the Yin residence!\" They rushed to extinguish it, only to find the courtyard illuminated by a radiant light, realizing a son had been born. All declared, \"This family’s hidden virtue has moved Heaven; in time, he will surely become an extraordinary man.\"\n\nAt three, he was precocious and had a keen memory. At five, he entered elementary school, reciting over a thousand characters daily and grasping profound principles with ease. Even in his youth, his demeanor set him apart from ordinary children. Once, while observing sacrificial rites, he pondered the nature of life and death, lost in deep contemplation.\n\nAt fourteen, he encountered the lineage master Danyang and immediately wished to enter the Dao, but his father resisted, and he was taken away. At nineteen, his family again compelled him to return home and confined him, yet he escaped repeatedly until they finally relented. He journeyed to the Lingxu Abbey in Wuguan, where he paid homage to the lineage master Changsheng and became his disciple. Soon after, he resided at the Western Hermitage in Changyi County, often sitting alone beneath a tree until dawn. One night in meditation, he saw Changsheng arrive in an ethereal manner, sever his head, cut open his heart, and replace them. Upon awakening, he gained profound insight.\n\nLater, he dwelled at an abbey in Fushan County, where for years he aided the poor and destitute, earning the people’s reverence. At the beginning of the Mingchang era (1190), hearing that the lineage master Changchun had returned to Qixia, he went to attend him. Changchun held him in high regard, imparting all teachings without reservation. The lineage master Yuyang Wang often clasped his hand to discuss the Dao and transmitted secret oral instructions. He also studied the *Book of Changes* under the lineage master Taigu Hao, learning doctrines unheard of in the world. From then on, his reputation in the Dao grew daily, and his renown spread far and wide. Scholars from all directions flocked to him as their master.\n\nAt the time, the powerful Wanjian clan of Longhu in Weizhou, admiring the master’s virtue, donated garden land to build the Yuqing Abbey in his honor. For years, though attendants and servants surrounded him, none ever saw his face or learned his name, so steadfast was his discipline.\n\nIn the winter of the *jǐmǎo* year of the Xingding era (1219), the Sacred Martial Emperor Taizu of the Great Yuan, returning from the Western Regions, dispatched the plenipotentiary Liu Zhonglu to summon the lineage master Changchun. Zhonglu, along with the Perfected Zhenchang Li of Yidu, remarked, \"Changchun now resides in Penglai. Without first meeting Master Yin, this grand endeavor cannot be accomplished.\" Arriving in Weiyang, Zhonglu paid homage to the master at the Yuqing Abbey. Struck by his dignified and solemn presence, he felt an involuntary reverence, losing his usual composure. When the imperial decree was mentioned, the master rejoiced, saying, \"To awaken the people with this Dao—now is the time!\" He then accompanied Zhonglu to meet Changchun at the Haotian Abbey in Laizhou.\n\nPreviously, neither the Jin nor the Song dynasties’ repeated summons had moved Changchun. Now, he and the master deliberated and resolved to journey north. Eighteen companions, all of eminent virtue, set forth, with the master leading the way. From the spring of the *gēngchén* year (1220) until the autumn of the *guǐwèi* year (1223), their four-year journey was fraught with hardships. After meeting the emperor in the Western Indies and delivering a response that pleased him, they returned to Yunzhong. There, Changchun learned of unrest in Shandong and the southward advance of the imperial troops. He declared, \"The lives of the people there hang by a thread. None but you can save them.\" He then sent the master to offer comfort and pacification. Those who heard him rejoiced to submit, and many lives were spared.\n\nIn the *jiǎshēn* year (1224), an imperial edict commanded Changchun to reside at the Taiji Palace, now known as the Changchun Palace. The master, his most intimate disciple, was revered by followers from all directions. He demurred, \"I have no merit or virtue to deserve such offerings,\" and withdrew to the Longyang Abbey in Dexing. Changchun frequently sent him personal writings, entrusting him with great responsibility, and bestowed upon him the title \"Pure Harmony.\"\n\nAfter Changchun ascended to immortality, the master retreated to the Misty Radiance Abbey in Shanggu. He wished to withdraw entirely from the world, but the community urgently entreated him to assume leadership of the teaching. Reluctantly, he returned to the Changchun Palace to succeed the lineage. Thereafter, disciples and devotees flocked to him, their gifts filling the halls.\n\nIn the spring of the *rénchén* year (1232), the Cultured Martial Emperor Taizong returned from his southern campaign. The master greeted him in Shuntian, where he received warm comfort and inquiry. The emperor then ordered the empress to offer incense at the Changchun Palace on his behalf, bestowing generous rewards.\n\nIn the summer of the *guǐsì* year (1233), the master traveled to Muwen Mountain. Li Xuxuan of the Taixuan Abbey remarked to others, \"Last year, a misty blue *qi* lingered over our abbey for days. Diviners said an extraordinary person would arrive—now the master’s coming confirms it.\" His teachings and transformations during his northern journey are fully recorded in *The Northern Travel Record*.\n\nIn the spring of the *jiǎwǔ* year (1234), he returned south. Upon reaching Yutian, the people rejoiced and urged him to stay for several days. Though the sun had set, he suddenly hastened his departure, traveling fifty or sixty *li* through the night before resting in the tall grass. None understood his reason. Later, upon returning to the abbey, they learned that at the time of his stay in Yutian, a band of raiders had intended to plunder him. Pursuing him to Dahedian, they turned back when they could not overtake him. His followers congratulated one another, saying, \"Without the master, what would have become of us?\"\n\nThat summer, hearing that the court had dispatched officials to pacify Guanzhong, the master met the desireless Perfected Li, who had come from Wei to Yanjing to offer sacrifices at the Hall of Compliance. The master instructed him to enter Guanzhong, gather the Daoist community, and restore the ancestral court of Liu and Jiang on Mount Zhongnan.\n\nIn the autumn, the court dispatched envoys to convey greetings and bestow a complete collection of Daoist scriptures. In the spring of the *yiwei* year, Du Dekang, the prefect of Qinzhou, invited the master to preside over the Yellow Register Jiao rites. The master traveled south from Yun and Ying, and wherever he passed, multitudes—numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands—lined the roads and fields, prostrating themselves in the dust to welcome him. Those who wished to offer their abbeys as disciples included Yuxu of Gaoliang, Shenqing of Dunxian, Chongyang of Dingxiang, and Xingguo of Pingyao, all of whom entreated him to take charge. When the time came to perform the Jiao rites, the land had long suffered drought and wind, yet for three days and nights, the lamps and candles burned undisturbed, while winds still raged beyond the ritual grounds. Du offered the Shenxiao Abbey of the prefecture as a gift, honoring the master with reverence. The master, attributing the flourishing of the mysterious transformation to the ancestral teacher Chongyang, turned his attention to the ancestral court on Mount Zhongnan.\n\nThat winter, Tian Decan, the chief administrator of Jingzhao, sent officials alongside the desireless Perfected Li to deliver an urgent petition. As their intentions aligned with the master’s, in the spring of the *bingshen* year, on the first month, he at last reached Mount Zhongnan to survey and plan the sacred precincts. Long ago, the ancestral teacher Chongyang had cultivated the Dao in Liujiang Village, and upon achieving realization, he burned his thatched hut and left behind a poem with the words, *\"Later generations shall restore it.\"* Earlier, during the Dading era, the two patriarchs Danyang and Changchun had already undertaken construction, but the conflagration of the Tianxing calamity reduced it nearly to ashes. Now, the master expanded it, and there were verses celebrating the succession of the ancestral restoration.\n\nThus, he leveled the overgrown mounds, built walls, and erected halls, beginning the reconstruction. He also selected venerable elders from the four directions to entrust with the revival of other ruined abbeys, including Zongsheng Abbey of Louguan, Taiping Abbey on Mount Zhongnan, Taiyi Abbey in Tangu, Huaqing Abbey on Mount Li, and Yuntai Abbey on Mount Taihua. At the time, the people of Shaanxi, newly pacified, had yet to settle into stable livelihoods, and the Daoist community struggled to secure food. The master consoled them with teachings on the karmic retribution of virtue and transgression.\n\nThat summer, upon receiving an imperial command, the master chose disciples of strict discipline and pure conduct to reside at Helin, praying for the nation’s blessings. In autumn, Yang Weizhong, the Grand Councilor, summoned him back to Yan. Passing through the Taihang Mountains, bandits knelt in submission, receiving his instruction and becoming law-abiding citizens.\n\nIn the spring of the *wuxu* year, the master suddenly declared, *\"I am old and weary of worldly affairs.\"* On the first day of the first month, he gathered elders from all directions and transmitted the Dharma to Perfected Li of Zhenchang, entrusting him with the seat of teaching. He then renovated the Western Abbey of Changchun and the Five-Flowered Great Chambers, expanding the abbeys to serve as a retreat for his old age.\n\nIn the winter of the *gengzi* year, Yila Baojian, the Grand Preceptor of Jingzhao, and Tian Decan, the chief administrator, invited the master to oversee the burial rites of the ancestral teacher Chongyang. The master gladly accepted, undeterred by the bitter cold and arduous journey. He often said, *\"I do this to repay the ancestral teacher’s kindness.\"* At the time, Shaanxi suffered a severe drought, but as the master arrived, snow fell, and the grand burial rites were solemnly conducted. The following year, on the twenty-fifth day of the first month of the *xinchou* year, the rites concluded. The scale of construction and the logistics of the funeral drew crowds of Daoists and laypeople from all directions, numbering in the thousands. Amid the clamor and unrest, the master’s moral authority and majestic virtue suppressed the chaotic energies, ensuring the completion of the task.\n\nThe master often traveled among the abbeys of Louguan with elder teachers, at ease and carefree, spreading the mysterious transformation. In the winter of that year, on the tenth month, his divine procession returned to Yanshan, where he resided in the Jade Flower Great Chambers. Officials and commoners from near and far revered him like the auspicious star or the vermilion phoenix.\n\nIn the spring of the *yisi* year, he appointed Pan Chonghe to preside over the Pure Yang Abbey in Yongle, Hedong, to oversee its establishment. Soon after, the empress sent attendants to bestow a golden crown and robes, commanding officials to provide protection. He also ordered his disciples to renovate the Jade Clarity Abbey in Weiyang, which, within a few years, was splendidly renewed.\n\nOn the fifth day of the second month of the *xinhai* year, he said to his attendants, *\"I have always favored the seclusion of Fangshan, so I shall reside there. Now, prepare the halls for the Longevity and Ascension Ritual.\"* The next day, after burning incense and paying homage to the sages, he addressed the assembly: *\"I shall soon depart.\"* The crowd was stunned, but the master remained silent, offering only instructions that his burial be simple. He then ceased eating, drinking only water and tea, sitting upright as he discoursed on the Dao, his voice as resonant and clear as ever.\n\nThat night, he adjusted his robes and cap, curled his arm beneath his head, and passed away, having lived eighty-three springs. His disciples wailed as though they had lost their parents, and the room filled with a fragrant aroma. People from near and far rushed to offer condolences and gifts, their procession unending as a marketplace.\n\nEarlier, the master had expressed his wish to be buried in the Great Chambers, but his Dharma heir, Perfected Li of Zhenchang, noted that the Great Chambers were too distant from the capital, making the journey difficult for mourners. Thus, he was interred at the Five-Flowered Chambers, where the Hall of Returning to the True was constructed to tend the incense and offerings.\n\nThe master’s writings, titled *The Baoguang Collection*, circulated in the world. In the autumn of the second year of the Zhongtong era, an imperial edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of Pure Harmony, Wondrous Dao, and Vast Transformation*.\n\n---\n\n**Perfected Zhenchang**\n\nThe master’s clan name was Li, his given name Zhichang, and his courtesy name Haoran. His ancestors hailed from Yongnian in Luozhou, but during the Song dynasty’s decline, they relocated to Fanyang in Pu, then later to Guancheng in Kai, where they settled. His great-grandfather Hao, grandfather Chang, father Man—all concealed their virtue and lived in obscurity, yet were deeply respected by their village.\n\nHis mother, née Nie, dreamed one night of a divine being presenting her with a jade child. Upon waking, she gave birth to the master on the twentieth day of the first month of the *guichou* year of the Mingchang era. At the age of six, both his parents passed away. He was raised in the household of his uncle Jichuan, whose given name was Meng and who was a renowned scholar. Jichuan excelled in both literary composition and righteous conduct, consistently ranking at the top in examinations. Though he sat for the metropolitan exams four times, he never attained the degree of *tong jinshi*.\n\nThe master was remarkably perceptive from a young age, his intentions and actions aligning effortlessly to fulfill his long-held aspirations. Yet he disdained ornate rhetoric, favoring instead a life of quiet simplicity. Often in silent prayer to the heavens, he yearned to meet an extraordinary teacher or worthy companion who might match his lifelong aspirations.\n\nAt nineteen, when his uncle began arranging a marriage for him, the master sighed and said: *\"I had hoped to pursue the Dao, yet I have not even crossed its threshold. If I become entangled in worldly desires, how can I ever achieve the lofty endeavors of the sages—transcending the dust of this world?\"* Soon after, he shouldered his books and staff, embarking on a wandering journey like the drifting clouds and flowing waters.\n\nFirst, he secluded himself on Laoshan in Donglai, then traveled to the Immortals’ Palace on Mount Tianzhu. The master of the palace remarked: *\"Master Li of Tangyin possesses keen discernment.\"* Upon seeing the master’s imposing and dignified bearing, he already knew he was no ordinary man. One winter night, as they discussed the Dao and the affairs of daily life, the palace master was deeply impressed. Later, he told his disciples: *\"In my thirty years on this path, among the venerable elders and virtuous masters I have conversed with, none have spoken with such precision as this young man—rarely have I encountered the like.\"*\n\nWhen the master prepared to leave, the palace master finally revealed: *\"You are a vessel of great promise for the Mystic Gate. This mountain hermitage is too remote and desolate for one such as you. In days past, extraordinary figures and ancestral masters emerged from the seaside—now only [Master] Changchun remains. You should seek him out; your future accomplishments cannot be measured.\"*\n\nThe next day, the master set out and arrived at the eastern mountains of Jimo. Amid the chaos of the *Zhenyou* era’s upheavals, local gentry and bandits swarmed like wasps. The mountains held caves large enough to shelter hundreds. When bandits approached, the people would hide inside, but on one occasion, they barred the master from entering. Soon after, he was captured by the bandits. When questioned about the cave’s location, he endured brutal torture—beaten to the point of death, only to revive—yet he refused to reveal it.\n\nAfter the bandits withdrew, those who had hidden in the cave emerged and surrounded him, weeping in gratitude: *\"We, a few hundred common folk, owed our lives to a single word from you. Though we wronged you by refusing you entry, you saved us at the cost of your own life—your virtue far surpasses ordinary human sentiment.\"* They competed to provide for him, ensuring his well-being. To this day, the elders of the region still speak of it.\n\nIn the summer of the *wuyin* year, the sixth month, word reached him that Master Changchun had taken residence in Dengzhou and Laizhou. The master hastily prepared for the journey and went to pay his respects at his seat. At their first meeting, Changchun recognized his exceptional qualities and treated him with uncommon regard. After receiving his teachings, the master redoubled his efforts, unwavering even amid the chaos of war, mortal peril, and hardship.\n\nTian Zuo, the Transport Commissioner of Shandong’s Eastern Circuit, esteemed his conduct and had heard of his past in Jimo, where the military governor Huang Guo and his deputy had sought his counsel to preserve the city. They had invited him to Yidu with a written summons, receiving him with the honors due a guest. In the summer of the *jimao* year, Zhang Lin, deputy commander of Yidu, defected from the Jin to the Song. That winter, in the twelfth month, the August Emperor Taizu dispatched the plenipotentiary Liu Zhonglu with an imperial edict and lavish gifts to summon Master Changchun from Donglai. Observing the turn of events, the master knew that Zhang Lin had recently surrendered the region to the Song and that his allegiance was fickle. He thought to himself: *If I do not speak to him first, I will surely be obstructed.* Thus, he went to persuade Lin, saying: *\"Master Changchun is a man of heaven. Now, three envoys have come to invite him, and he resolutely journeys north. Forsaking the nearer path for the more distant one, his heart for saving the world is plain to see. If you, my lord, can assist his passage, not only will this region be blessed, but it will be an immeasurable boon to all living beings under heaven.\"* Lin was pleased and issued orders along their route, providing an escort for their journey.\n\nIn the spring of the *gengchen* year, the first month, Changchun set out, accompanied by eighteen followers, the master among them. By the second month, they reached Yan. The following spring, they traveled north, arriving in the seventh month at Mount Abu Khan, a mere ten thousand *li* from the Central Plains. There, a thousand households of Han people came forth to greet them with dust rising at their feet, bowing in reverence as if witnessing a once-in-an-era encounter. They entreated Changchun to establish an abbey and select someone to oversee it. From his seat, Changchun pointed to the master and addressed the crowd: *\"This man is enlightened, upright, and erudite. I leave him here for you—treat him well.\"* He bestowed upon him the name *Zhenchangzi* and inscribed the abbey’s name as *Qixia*. After Changchun departed westward, the master led the people in construction, completing the abbey in short order. He also established the Changchun and Yuhua societies, which have endured without interruption to this day.\n\nIn the summer of the *guiwei* year, the fifth month, Changchun returned from his journey and rested at the abbey. One day, as guests gathered for a feast, Changchun silently handed the master a bow and a quiver without a word. The master, likewise silent, accepted them, looped them at his waist, and composed a poem in gratitude. Changchun merely smiled in acknowledgment. For at Abu Khan, leaving the bow and quiver behind was his way of signaling his intent to entrust him with a mission.\n\nIn the seventh month of autumn, they reached the Lower Waters. The lingering heat of late summer was still intense, and Changchun, seeking respite from the cold in the gate tower of an official residence, called the master to him and instructed: *\"A true master is not easily met; one who has attained the Dao is not easily encountered; and even when encountered, they are not easily recognized. Those who hold fast to the Dao, whose conduct is at once human and celestial, who dwell in the body as if it were a temporary abode while their essence remains profound and still—who forget hunger and thirst yet abide in constant peace, who attain perfect stillness and transcend form, who wander alone in the wondrous court of the boundless—these words you must remember, awaiting the day you realize them for yourself.\"* The master bowed in gratitude, then ventured to ask: *\"When I once took refuge in the mountains of Shandong to escape bandits, I was beaten and tortured until I fell into darkness. At midday, the sun blazed, yet my eyes saw nothing, and the paths of light and shadow were sundered. What is the principle of returning to the root and restoring life?\"* Changchun replied: *\"Life and death in man are but the illusory appearances of day and night. Trace the way of these appearances to their source, and you will find there is nothing. When your doubtful thoughts have not yet arisen, examine life and death, day and night—they do not touch you. Then the light of heaven is clear and boundless, like the vastness of the empty sky. Words, teachings, and images cannot describe it; this is where your doubts are stilled.\"* The master bowed again and received his teaching.\n\nAfter Changchun entered the Central Plains, his affairs grew increasingly numerous, and Daoists and laypeople from all directions came to pay their respects, all of whom he entrusted to the master. Though the master harbored a secret desire to retreat into seclusion, he had not yet acted upon it, and even his closest friends were unaware. Suddenly, Changchun said to him: *\"There was once a Daoist named Zhao among my disciples who was diligent in his practice. One day, he abruptly asked to leave for another place. I warned him: ‘If you depart when you should not, you will either regress in the Dao or grow negligent in it.’\"* Startled, the master realized these words were meant for him, and his desire to withdraw vanished.\n\nThe master compiled Changchun’s discourses on the Dao during his audience with the emperor in the Western Regions into *The Western Journey*, which circulated in the world. In the autumn of the *dinghai* year, the seventh month, Changchun ascended as an immortal. Qinghe succeeded him as master of the teachings and appointed the master as *Dudao Lu* (Chief Daoist Registrar), concurrently overseeing the affairs of Changchun Abbey. At the time, the imperial court was in Helin, and the master traveled there once a year, taking it as his duty to uphold the lineage and teachings of the school. Even when the winds and snows of the northern deserts froze his skin, he did not flinch.\n\nIn the autumn of the *gengyin* year, the seventh month, Emperor Taizong ascended the throne. The master was received in the Qianlou Hall. At the time, the emperor had issued an edict summoning scholars versed in the classics to instruct the crown prince. The master presented the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Dao De Jing*, and the *Classic of Filial Piety*. The emperor praised him, and in the winter of the eleventh month, he was granted leave to return.\n\nIn the winter of the *xinmao* year, false accusations arose that the murals in the Central Hall contained inappropriate elements. Qinghe was arrested, and the crowd scattered in alarm. The master alone stepped forward to take his place, saying: *\"Qinghe is the master of our lineage, charged with transmitting the Dao. All matters of the teaching are my responsibility. If there is guilt, let it be mine alone; let no other be implicated.\"* The emissary admired his integrity and agreed, sparing him from restraints and shackles but confining him in prison. At midnight, the shackles suddenly opened on their own. The master informed the jailer, who re-locked them, only for them to open again. The next day, a jailer reported this to the authorities. By chance, the emissary was dining with them, and on the bone of the meat he was eating, the visage of Changchun appeared. The lawsuit was thus dropped.\n\nIn the summer of the *guisi* year, the sixth month, the master received an edict to proceed to the capital at Yanjing, where he was to instruct eighteen sons of Mongol nobles. He recommended the Venerable Jizhao, Feng Zhiheng, to assist him. Day by day, month by month, their talents and skills flourished, earning praise.\n\nIn the autumn of the *yiwei* year, the seventh month, the master received an edict to construct a Daoist abbey in Helin, entrusting him to select eminent Daoists to reside and preside over it.\n\nIn the spring of the *wuxu* year, the first month, during the Pure Harmony Assembly, he gathered venerable elders from all directions. The master personally inscribed a document, entrusting him to succeed the teaching seat. Judging that he could not decline, he accepted. In the third month, he journeyed to the imperial court to memorialize matters concerning the Daoist teachings, beginning with the Lingxu Abbey on Mount Zhongnan—the sacred ground where Ancestral Master Chongyang had refined the true and inaugurated the transformation. By imperial decree, it was renamed Chongyang Abbey, and Jie Dongzhen was appointed to reside as abbot, overseeing the teachings in the Shaanxi region. Baiyun Jinggong and Wuyu Ligong were assigned to assist him, and grand construction commenced.\n\nIn the *yisi* year, he memorialized to request that the Pure Yang Ancestral Shrine in Yongle, Hedong, along with the halls beneath the masters’ true portraits, be bestowed with abbey plaques to manifest the mysterious transformation. In the *bingwu* year, Emperor Dingzong ascended the throne. The master was summoned to perform the Great Universal Offering on the fifteenth day of the first month in the *wushen* year at Changchun Abbey. An imperial edict was issued, commanding that all great abbeys and temples on famous mountains and rivers, as well as eminent Daoist masters, be placed under the master’s authority to confer titles of virtue and power.\n\nIn the autumn of the *xinhai* year, Emperor Xianzong succeeded to the throne and, desiring to observe the sacrificial rites, ordered the offering of sacrifices to the sacred mountains and rivers. In the eighth month, an imperial envoy was dispatched to summon the master to the court. The emperor sat upright upon his throne, personally sealing incense and a letter, concentrating his mind in solemn prayer. He bestowed upon the master a golden tally and an imperial decree, along with five thousand taels of silver from the inner palace to cover the expenses. The master, bearing the edict, traveled south by post carriage to perform the sacrificial rites at the sacred mountains and rivers.\n\nThe following spring, on the first auspicious day of the first month, he arrived at the ancestral abbey on Mount Zhongnan. With reverent devotion, he conducted the sacrificial rites, planned and oversaw construction, and rectified the Daoist regulations. All the immortal abbeys and Daoist temples at the foot of the mountain were visited and restored, with the master’s virtue and bestowed titles varying in degree—such was done because this was the root of the teaching. By the fifteenth day of the fourth month, the immortal retinue returned eastward, stopping at the Pure Yang Abbey on Mount Zhongtiao, where the same rites were observed as at Mount Zhongnan.\n\nIn the ninth month of autumn, he returned to Yanjing. In the winter of the *guichou* year, the tenth month, the sagely emperor, then residing in his princely estate, established a court in the upper capital. The master was commanded to perform the Golden Register Great Fast, acting as Grand Master, universally ordaining Daoist priests and nuns along the routes and conferring upon them precept certificates. In the spring of the *jiayin* year, the first month, an envoy was dispatched to the abbey to convene eminent Daoists from all regions for a Great Universal Offering. The master was charged with delivering the souls of the deceased throughout the realm and was bestowed five hundred taels of gold and five thousand taels of silver. All ritual objects—jade tablets, rings, seals, and offerings of incense and lamps—were provided by the court, from the commencement to the conclusion of the rites. Auspicious omens of phoenixes, cranes, and five-colored clouds were too numerous to record.\n\nThat autumn, upon hearing of the garrison troops at Bo and She, the master dispatched Daoists led by Shi Zhijian to restore the Taiqing Abbey. In the autumn of the *yimao* year, the seventh month, he met the emperor at the traveling palace. At that time, the Western Regions presented tribute, and the crown prince and various princes were in attendance at the banquet. The master was commanded to join them.\n\nOn the first day of the twelfth month, the emperor addressed the master, saying: “I wish for all the people under heaven to live in peace and contentment, yet I have not found those who share this heart with me. What should be done?” The master memorialized: “Since ancient times, when a sagely ruler cherishes the people, men of talent and virtue will surely respond to his sincerity and come forth.” He then enumerated the joint employment of meritorious officials and worthy ministers. The emperor praised and accepted his counsel. From noon until the lighting of the lamps, the master remained in audience, receiving the emperor’s inquiries, before retiring.\n\nIn the spring of the *bingchen* year, the first month, he petitioned to retire due to old age. In the summer, the fourth month, he returned from the northern court. On the first day of the sixth month, the *gengshen* day, weary of constant engagements, he withdrew from worldly affairs, resting against his desk in silence. On the *wuyin* day, he sat upright with solemn dignity and addressed his attendants: “Last night, the realm I beheld was extraordinary. I know my allotted time has come; the hour of my return has arrived.” He entrusted the succession of his duties to Zhang Zhijing, whom he had previously memorialized as his successor, leaving no room for debate.\n\nThe following day, he composed a final verse and passed away in perfect accord with the Dao.\n\nAt sixty-four years of age, he was interred at Cuncun Hall on Wuhua Mountain. His writings from former days included the *Anthology of Further Mystery* in twenty scrolls, which circulated in the world. In the autumn of the *xinyou* year of the Zhongtong era, the ninth month, an imperial edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title \"Perfected of True Constancy, Supreme Virtue, and Proclaimed Teachings,\" with the honorific \"Perfected of the Cavernous Realms.\"\n\nThe Master’s religious name was Shanqing, styled Boxiang, a native of Ninghai. He descended from the eminent Han dynasty magistrate Yugong of the Gao family. His grandfather, Yan-sheng, once served as a minor official in Haoshi County. His father, Zhen, concealed his brilliance and never entered public service.\n\nThe Master was born on the eighth day of the twelfth month in the *bingxu* year of the Dading era (1166). From childhood, he abstained from meat. As he grew, he mastered the classics and histories and developed a refined passion for the study of the Dao, virtue, and the cultivation of life. He hailed from the same village as the Patriarch of Danyang. In the summer of the *renyin* year, the fifth month of the twenty-second cyclical count (1182), Danyang returned from the western regions of Shaan to his hometown and expounded the Dao at Golden Lotus Hall, drawing crowds of elders and children alike. The Master, then seventeen, attended with poise and striking refinement. Danyang, upon seeing him, inquired and learned he was the grandson of Yan-sheng. Sighing, he said: “I once feared the reproaches of Chongyang and nearly faltered in my resolve, yet it was Yan-sheng’s steadfast support that enabled me to complete my work. If this youth enters the Dao to repay his grandfather’s virtue, would that not be fitting?” The following day, the Master returned with the assembly. Danyang produced a cooked taro and offered it to him; the Master bowed and ate it.\n\nHis parents, upon hearing this, stood by with a small table and staff, awaiting instruction. Danyang then bestowed upon him his present religious name and style. Thereafter, his father Zhen and his mother, née Wang, conferred: “This child is the sole heir to our ancestral sacrifices. Now that Danyang has guided him into the Dao, it must be by long-standing karmic affinity. Danyang was once a Confucian scholar and would not rashly sever our family’s lineage. Yet the gate of self-cultivation surely transcends worldly concerns. What, then, do we cling to?” They, along with their daughter and household, all took refuge under Danyang’s guidance. Danyang instructed Zhen with the religious name Daoji, Wang with Daoqing and the sobriquet \"Jade Creek Recluse,\" and their daughter with Miaojing—she being the Master’s elder sister. Later, all became venerable figures in the Daoist tradition.\n\nIn the winter of the following year, *guimao* (1183), the Master accompanied Danyang to Yuxian Abbey in Laiyang for the offering of a grand jiao ritual.\n\nNot long after, Danyang ascended as an immortal, and the two patriarchs Changsheng and Yuyang came to preside over the funeral rites. The Master had once heard Danyang speak of repaying the virtue of Yan Sheng, so they entrusted him with the rituals and protocols of the Daoist gate, instructing Song Chongfu to accompany him into the Pass to serve the Patriarch Changchun, thereby distancing him from the attachments of his homeland and kin. The Master received the teaching and journeyed west to the ancestral court of Zhongnan, where he paid homage to Master Lingyang Li. He fully conveyed the commands of Changsheng and Yuyang, and Lingyang, observing the Master’s refined and serene bearing—his every gesture uncommon—taught him to dwell in mountain forests, shun the dust of markets, draw near to those of the Dao, and cultivate fields of merit. He further instructed him to detour to Pingdong to visit the eminent scholar Cui Yangtou.\n\nThe Master followed the command and set forth. One evening, he lodged at the Palace of the Queen Mother of Huishan, where in the night he dreamed of an old woman offering a tray of cakes to a Hu barbarian-headed Daoist. The Daoist took one cake, broke it in half, and gave half to the Master to eat, then ate the other half himself. Two days later, he arrived at Cui’s hermitage in Pingdong. No sooner had he completed his bows than an old woman entered bearing a tray of cakes to present to Cui. Both Cui and the woman were the very figures from his dream. Cui took one cake, broke it in half, and gave half to the Master to eat, then ate the other half himself, saying, “With the one from the other night, you have now eaten a whole cake of mine.” At that moment, Zhao Jiugu stood by, and Cui pointed to the Master, saying, “This one is teachable—perhaps he bears the green thread of the Dao.” After residing there for several months, he received much guidance and instruction.\n\nHe then took leave and traveled to Longmen Mountain in Longzhou to attend upon Changchun, humbly tending the hearth and drawing water. In the spring of *yisi* (1185), Changchun sent the Master to Luoyang to deliver a letter to the Patriarch Changzhen. Changzhen instructed him that the essentials of learning the Dao lay in subduing arrogance, tempering sharpness, and forging the dust-laden heart. Before long, Changzhen returned to the True, and the Master performed the burial rites before re-entering the Pass. He begged for alms in Tong and Hua, practicing what he had been taught.\n\nIn *bingwu* (1186), Changchun descended from Mount Long and revived the teachings at the ancestral court. He summoned the Master to his seat and ordered him to serve diligently each day, thereby weaving a bond of profound affinity. Earlier, when Changchun had traveled through the Long River region, he had admired the Stone Gate in Kuangyang County of Jingyang and, finding it an auspicious site, built a Quanzhen Hall, appointing his disciple Pu Cha Daoyuan to reside there. In the *xinhai* year of the Mingchang era (1191), as Changchun prepared to return to the eastern seas, he said to the Master, “Your affinity lies here—go nowhere else. One needs companions to succeed, and companions must be chosen with care. Pu Cha Daoyuan’s heart abides in the Supreme Dao; he will surely aid in the completion of your work. Go and dwell with him.”\n\nThe Master then journeyed to the Five Sacred Peaks of Mount Hua, where he hewed stone to make his dwelling. He ate but one meal a day and remained sleepless day and night for seven years. Devoting himself solely to the Dao, he attained the wondrous. Whatever had not yet come to pass, he knew in advance. To this day, the people of Long call his grotto “The Cave of the Perfected Yu,” where they have fashioned an image to honor him. Pu Cha later invited the Master to descend the mountain and dwell together.\n\nIn the year *cheng'an wuwu* (1198), local patrons in the prefecture donated funds to construct a temple, which they named Jade Clarity Abbey. Soon after, they respectfully invited Master Yuyang to transmit scriptures and registers, aiding in the cultivation of the Dao and the salvation of beings. From near and far, reverence for him grew ever deeper.\n\nIn the year *taihe guihai* (1203), the governor of Longzhou bestowed upon him the title \"Master of Tranquil Emptiness.\" Five years later, in *yichou* (1205), he returned to Restful Radiance Abbey. Master Changchun urged him to advance in the Dao, but before long, Changchun hastened west to return home. Passing through Linyi, he encountered Master Yuyang at the county seat. Yuyang first asked, \"In Guanzhong, with whom do you keep company?\" The Master replied, \"Pu Cha.\" Yuyang then inquired about Pu Cha’s entry into the Dao, and the Master recounted how he had followed Changchun’s command. Yuyang said, \"If that is so, then he is indeed a worthy companion.\" Thereupon, he imparted subtle teachings and bestowed the title \"Master of Cavernous Perfection.\"\n\nAfter several days, they parted. Traveling through Linlü, the Master admired its secluded beauty and took up residence at Heavenly Peace Abbey. In the year *bingyin* (1206), Changchun sent Bi Zhichang with a letter of instruction, saying: \"Generally, those of the highest capacity distance themselves only from wealth and sensuality. Since you have already renounced wealth and embraced righteousness, why remain in the depths of mountains and valleys to guard stillness so earnestly?\" The letter concluded: \"Upon receiving this, descend the mountain at once and return to aid the people of Ji and Long. At present, the Teaching lacks capable hands—you must propagate it widely.\" He also instructed the Master to change his name to \"Aspiring Dao.\" The Master bowed in acceptance and returned to Qin.\n\nIn the eighth year, *wuchen* (1208), after the southern campaign ended in triumph, he was moved by the many captives who had been ransomed and redeemed. Since completing his studies under the Five Perfected Ones, hundreds had come to his door seeking ordination as Daoist priests. He established abbeys for them throughout the region between Fengxiang, Fen, and Long.\n\nIn the year *yuanguang guiwei* (1223), he was appointed director of the Central Abbey of Supreme Oneness in Bianliang, but when Li Chongxu recommended him as his successor, he declined. In the first year of *Zhengda* (1224), the emperor mourned the fallen western troops and dispatched Minister of Rites Zhao Bingwen to conduct a sacrificial rite at Pingdong. The Master was invited to preside over the salvation ritual. He presented all the offerings he had received and donated them to the military.\n\nZhao, who had long admired the Master’s lofty purity, had his portrait painted and recommended him to the court. An imperial summons was issued, but the Master again declined. Later, when bandits ravaged the Long Mountains, Bi Zhichang invited him to reside in Cavernous Perfection Abbey in Qishan, a humble dwelling among the Five Clans. In the year *bingxu* (1226), an imperial envoy was sent to summon him once more. This time, he rose and answered the call. Upon arriving in the capital, he was appointed director of the Central Abbey of Supreme Oneness. Ministers such as Mi Guogong Zhu, Marquis Shen Gong Zhi, Minister Yang Yunyi, Censor Xu Gu, and Academician Feng Bi—all high-ranking officials—vied to admire and emulate him.\n\nAt that time, the Jin dynasty’s fate was nearing its end. Corvée labor and taxes multiplied, and the people suffered greatly. Levies were imposed even on Daoists and Buddhists. The Master often interceded with the authorities, persuading them to abandon such measures. Monks and priests from all directions found refuge in his protection.\n\nIn the year *dinghai* (1227), Daoist communities from the north reported that Changchun had ascended to immortality on Mount Yan. The Master ate but one meal a day and observed a heart-mourning for three years. In *gengyin* (1230), when Henan suffered a drought, the emperor ordered the imperial attendants to escort the Master to perform prayers for rain at the Altar of Relief. The emperor himself awaited the rites within the palace. As soon as the ritual concluded, sweet rain fell, and the emperor issued a special decree of praise, appointing him to oversee the affairs of the Five Sacred Peaks’ Protector Deities Abbey. That autumn, the harvest was abundant.\n\nIn the spring of *tianxing guisi* (1233), Bianjing surrendered to the sagely court. The imperial court dispatched envoys to seek out masters of the Three Teachings, and the Master was named foremost among them. In the seventh month of autumn, he crossed northward from Zhongle. Many followed him, and the boatmen, suspecting he carried gold and silk, set sail at dusk. They stopped at a sandbar, claiming they had reached the shore, and abandoned the passengers. At dawn, the Master and his companions found themselves surrounded by surging waves, yet he remained calm and unafraid. That very day, the embankment at Eight Willows collapsed, and the floodwaters rushed south. The Master ordered his disciple Fu Daoqing to hire two boats, rescuing all those in peril. Thus, they arrived safely in Daming.\n\nAt the time, Master Xuantong Fan Yuanxi presided over the Supreme Clarity Abbey in Dongping. Hearing of the Master’s arrival, he led the local officials and Daoist communities to welcome him with carriages and horses, offering him the seat of honor. The Master declined but, unable to refuse, began propagating the Teaching in the eastern plains.\n\nIn the autumn of *yiwei* (1235), he journeyed north to Yanjing to pay respects at Changchun’s Hall of Compliance. The people of Yan earnestly entreated him to stay, and he could not return south. In the summer of *bingshen* (1236), locusts and drought ravaged the Yan region. The officials of the Branch Secretariat implored the Master to perform exorcisms and prayers. Yielding to their pleas, he conducted a ritual, and rain fell at once; the locusts caused no harm.\n\nIn autumn, Master Pure Harmony Yin returned from Guanzhong to Yan and instructed Zhenchang Li to build a chamber in the western courtyard, where he and the Master could reside opposite each other, daily enjoying each other’s company. In the spring of *wuxu* (1238), Zhenchang succeeded to the leadership of the Teaching.\n\nIn the fourth month of summer, the court selected and examined Daoists and Buddhists. Given the Master’s eminent reputation, he was granted the title \"Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery, Vast Virtue, and Cavernous Perfection.\" Around that time, the Beijing Prefect Wudeheng constructed a Complete Perfection Abbey and invited the Master to serve as a model for the people of the state. He reluctantly agreed and set out.\n\nIn the seventh month of autumn, Zhenchang memorialized the throne and received an edict renaming the Lingxu Abbey on Mount Zhongnan as Chongyang Palace, appointing the Master as its abbot and overseer of the Teaching in the Shaanxi region. In the summer of *gengzi* (1240), the Grand Preceptor Yila Baojian and the Jingzhao Governor Tian Decan sent envoys with petitions to invite him. He set out that very day. The officials and commoners of Yan, knowing he was restoring the ancestral sanctuary, could not detain him. Gifts of gold, silk, and other valuables filled his path. Passing through Yan, Zhao, and Jin, he arrived in Qin. Wherever he went, the local lords welcomed him beyond the city gates, and the gentry and common folk vied to pay him homage. All the funds he received were devoted to construction and restoration.\n\nIn the spring of *xinchou* (1241), he convened masters and disciples from all directions to inter the Patriarch in the White Cloud Hall. At that time, the Guanzhong region had only recently been pacified; the land was sparsely populated and vast. His disciples, mindful of the Patriarch’s transformative virtue, competed to enter the passes, cultivating the land and establishing abbeys to support the Teaching. Their influence extended east to the seas and Mount Tai, west to Gong and Tao, south to the Yangtze and Huai rivers, and north to the deserts.\n\nThe flow of Daoists and layfolk bearing incense and offerings never ceased. Together with the laborers working on the Li Palace, their number never fell below several thousand, all sustained by the Master’s profound virtue. On the first and fifteenth of each lunar month, he would invariably hold a vegetarian feast, gather the assembly, and instruct them in cultivating the body and nurturing the nature as their practice, establishing abbeys and initiating others as their conduct, and expounding the principles of sin and blessing so that each might follow what suited them. Thus, all adhered to the rules and observed the precepts, and the Teaching remained serene and undisturbed. Within a decade, grand abbeys and towering halls dotted the land of the Three Qins like stars scattered across the sky. The ancestral abbey’s system became the finest of all jade halls in the realm.\n\nAt the place where the Ganhé Patriarch had encountered the True One, the Master built the Encountering Immortals Abbey to manifest the numinous traces. Furthermore, at the Western Peak’s Fanxi, where Master Changchun had refined and transformed, he dispatched a thousand disciples to establish the Changchun Attainment of the Dao Abbey in gratitude for the Teaching’s virtue. The Vanguard Commander of Jiagu, acting as the benefactor of the ancestral abbey, built the Hall of the August Void and invited the Master to conduct a Grand Offering of the Luo Heaven on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the *jiachen* year (1244), to deliver and console the departed souls throughout the realm. Coinciding with its completion, Prince Kuoduan, the Great King, established his office in the Western Regions. He sent the emissary Zhao Chongjian to the abbey to perform the Golden Register Offering for seven days and nights. As the sacred writ descended, the True Writs of the Northeast spontaneously ignited without fire. When the emissary returned and reported this marvel, the Prince issued an imperial edict to protect and uphold the Mysterious Teaching, further bestowing the name \"Wanshou Palace of Chongyang\" upon the abbey and conferring the title of \"Perfected\" upon the five masters who conducted the offering—the Master, along with Song Piyun, Xue Taixia, Huang Baiyun, and Li Wuyu.\n\nIn the fifth lunar month, the imperial decree dispatched the imperial attendant Pei Tianmin to the abbey, presenting imperial incense and granting special favor. In the autumn of the *bingwu* year (1246), Wang Dezhen, the Grand Marshal of Gongchang, wished to invite the Master to perform an offering to console his late father’s spirit. Fearing the Master would be unable to travel, he petitioned the Prince’s court. As Wang was a founding minister of the state, the Prince commanded the Chancellor Wanyan Fengge to respectfully journey to Zhongnan and extend the invitation, to which the Master assented. Gongchang bordered the Western Qiang, whose inhabitants were accustomed solely to the Buddhist Teaching. The Master transformed them with the Dao of non-action, purity, rectifying the mind, and sincerity, and their customs were thereby entirely altered.\n\nIn winter, he expounded the Teaching at Qinting, responding to the near and far with boundless compassion. The literati of Qin compiled the *Record of the Western Regions*. In the spring of the *dingwei* year (1247), he returned to the abbey. In the eighth lunar month of autumn, the Empress Dowager bestowed upon him a ceremonial cap and robe, along with a precious edict, commanding local officials to protect and uphold the Mysterious Transformation without allowing disturbances.\n\nIn the summer of the *gengxu* year (1250), the Hall of Illuminating Clarity was completed. The Master, leaning on his staff, strolled beneath it and said: \"I have devoted myself to the ancestral abbey and managed the construction of this hall for nearly a decade, and only now do I see its completion. Yet this is not merely to boast of its grandeur. For the common mind, when one sees the solemn adornment without, reverence naturally arises within. As for those of superior attainment who cultivate the body through purity, tranquility, and the cessation of thoughts, this may not concern them. Yet in propagating the Teaching and delivering others, such symbolic constructions and lofty edifices cannot be entirely neglected. The Teaching is exalted because the Dao is honored.\"\n\nOn the third day of the tenth lunar month in winter, he bathed, composed himself, and sat upright. Summoning the assembly before him, he entrusted them with instructions for their cultivation. As the sun reached its zenith, he left a final verse and passed away in the Hall of Myriad Wonders, at the age of eighty-five. For nine days, offerings were made, and his complexion remained as if alive. Daoists and layfolk from near and far, bearing fly-whisks and presenting funeral gifts, numbered in the tens of thousands. He was interred in the Immortals’ Garden of the abbey, beside Masters Yuchan and Lingyang.\n\nHis poems, hymns, and works on delivering others and propagating the Dao were compiled into the *Hongzhong Collection*, which circulated in the world. The Hanlin Academician Meng Panlin composed an essay, and the literati of Chang’an specially came to the ancestral abbey to offer sacrifices. Yang Huan, the Transport Commissioner of Henan, composed a stele inscription on his virtuous conduct.\n\nIn the *wuyin* year of the Zhiyuan era (1278), the Hall of Reflecting on the True was built behind the White Cloud Hall, where an image was installed for offerings.\n\n---\n\n**Perfected Piyun**\nThe Master’s surname was Song, his given name Defang, and his courtesy name Guangdao. He was a native of Yecheng in Laizhou. His ancestors were renowned for their accumulated goodness. On the night of his birth, villagers saw an auspicious light illuminating his home, brighter than the sun. This occurred on the first day of the eighth lunar month in the *guimao* year of the Dading era (1183), and people marveled at it. As soon as he could speak, he loved reading and did not engage in childish play. Gifted with keen intelligence and a retentive memory, those who knew him said his nature had been nurtured in past lives.\n\nAt the age of twelve, he asked his mother: \"Can one avoid death?\" She replied: \"Go ask the Perfected Liu, the Divine Immortal.\" At that time, Master Liu Changsheng was propagating the Teaching at the Martial Palace. The next day, the Master went directly to him. Upon seeing him, Changsheng loved his refined bone structure and extraordinary speech, keeping him by his side to attend to his needs. In the course of serving—sweeping, responding, and attending—Changsheng discerned his pent-up aspirations and imparted the true Dharma to awaken him. Having received this guidance, the Master cultivated and nurtured himself day and night without rest.\n\nLater, he was ordained by Master Yuyang and registered as a Daoist. After Changsheng ascended as an immortal, he served Master Changchun at Qixia. He was particularly fond of Confucian and Daoist classics such as the *Book of Changes*, the *Laozi*, the *Doctrine of the Mean*, the *Great Learning*, the *Zhuangzi*, and the *Liezi*. Though he also perused the *Book of Poetry*, *Book of Documents*, philosophers, and histories, he extracted from them the learning of exhausting principle and fulfilling the nature. Through immersion, practice, silent comprehension, and luminous penetration, his actions invariably accorded with the Dao, and his daily renewal could not be concealed.\n\nIn the spring of the *gengchen* year (1220), the Great Ancestor, Emperor Shengwu of the Great Yuan, dispatched the imperial attendant Liu Zhonglu to summon Changchun from the eastern shores of the sea. Among the eighteen chosen to accompany him, the Master was one. After three years of travel, they returned to Yan and resided at the Changchun Abbey. At that time, all who followed Changchun labored diligently.\n\nThe Master alone remained composed, finding solace in the zither and books. When others criticized him to Changchun, Changchun rebuffed them, saying: \"Do not clamor against this man. In the future, when it comes to the great enterprise of upholding the lineage and spreading the teachings, none of you will match him.\"\n\nChangchun once privately remarked to the Master: \"Your destiny lies in the southwest, does it not?\" The Master then spoke of the Daoist scriptures falling into decay and the need to restore them. Changchun replied: \"This is a matter of great magnitude. I have no leisure to attend to it as well. Yet in the unseen, there must be one who will take charge of it. One day, you shall assume this task.\" He then bestowed upon him the name *Piyunzi* (\"Cloud-Disperser\").\n\nAfter Changchun’s ascension, Qinghe succeeded him in overseeing the teachings. He appointed the Master to supervise the religious order, and in every action, the Master was impartial yet governed by rules. All within and beyond the Daoist community submitted to him in heart.\n\nIn the *guisi* year (1233), the Grand Chancellor Hu Tianlu, then serving as the regional commissioner in Hebei, invited him to preside over the jiao rites. In the *jiawu* year (1234), he traveled to the Western Mountains of Taiyuan, where he discovered the ancient Wutian Abbey. Its original site contained two stone grottoes, both still adorned with solemn Daoist statues, and the walls bore the characters \"Song Tong.\" The Master spent three years restoring the abbey, and its halls and pavilions rose majestically, resplendent with gold, azure, and cinnabar—like a dragon’s head emerging, a veritable cave-heaven.\n\nIn the *dingyou* year (1237), he again presided over the jiao rites in Pingyang. While at Xuandu Abbey, he recalled Changchun’s words during moments of leisure in the past: \"The matter of the canon is of great importance. I have no time for it, but one day, you shall take it up.\" And again: \"Your destiny lies in the southwest.\" The Master privately reflected: \"My teacher, Changchun, possessed the power of divine transformation and celestial destiny, manifesting the marvel of foresight. Whatever he spoke of beforehand invariably came to pass. His words about my destiny in the southwest—I have already settled and fulfilled them. Why then should I hesitate regarding the canon?\"\n\nThus, he consulted with his disciple, the lecturer Tongzhenzi Qin Zhian, and devised a plan to cast woodblocks for the scriptures’ dissemination. When Chancellor Hu learned of this, he was delighted and contributed a thousand taels of silver to initiate the project. He then entrusted Tongzhenzi with overseeing the endeavor at Xuandu Abbey in Pingyang. By the time the work was completed, it adhered precisely to the original plan, as recorded in the stele inscription composed by the Hanlin Academician Li Leng. From the inception to the conclusion, every detail was meticulously documented.\n\nIn repairing omissions, gathering lost texts, and scouring the land for remnants, he traversed tens of thousands of miles across the realm. Had another undertaken this task, they would have either been overwhelmed by its complexity or wearied by its labor.\n\nThe Master, still with energy to spare, then opened the Nine Yang Caverns at Mount Shen in Laizhou and established Daoist abbeys and temples—from Yan to Qin and Jin, nearly forty in all. In the spring of the *xinchou* year, during the first month, he attended the interment of Ancestral Master Chongyang at Zhongnan. In the *guimao* year, he traveled from Gantang to Yongle Town and paid homage at the shrine of Pure Yang. Finding it desolate and cramped, he gathered Daoist followers to reside there. Though later it was Master Zhenchang Li who petitioned the imperial court to undertake grand renovations, the Master had laid the foundation for the endeavor.\n\nIn the spring of the *jiachen* year, he arrived at the ancestral sanctuary in Zhongnan to officiate the jiao rites for Prince Kuoduan, the Great King. Upon the rites’ conclusion, he was conventionally bestowed the title *Xuandu Zhidao Zhenren* (\"Perfected One of the Mysterious Capital and the True Dao\"). By this time, the transmission of the scriptural canon and its superior lineage had already ceased. He then retired to Snow Hall, where he daily conversed on the Dao with elders and venerable masters. On the eleventh day of the tenth month in the *dingwei* winter, he bathed, changed his robes, and, after manifesting a minor illness, passed away in the Pavilion of Awaiting Cranes at his residence, aged sixty-five. Seven days later, he was interred in the Immortal’s Transcendence Garden of the abbey.\n\nDuring his lifetime, his collected poems and prose were compiled into *Lequan* (\"Joy in Wholeness\"), in two volumes, which circulated in the world. In the winter of the *wushen* year, his disciples relocated his immortal remains to Pure Yang Abbey in Yongle Town, Hedong, where they buried him, erected a shrine, and established a site for incense offerings. In the spring of the first month of the *gengwu* year of the *Zhiyuan* era, an imperial edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Xuantong Hongjiao Piyun Zhenren* (\"Perfected One of Mysterious Penetration, Vast Teaching, and Cloud-Dispersing\").\n\n**White Cloud Perfected One**\nThe Master’s surname was Jing, his given name Zhiyuan, and his courtesy name Zixuan. His family was a prominent clan of Ye County in Laizhou. His grandfather, Dezhong, and his father, Zun, both cherished reclusion in the countryside and were renowned in their village for their hidden virtues. During the *Huangtong* era, when famine left the fields strewn with withered grass, his family distributed congee to the starving, continuing until the autumn harvest.\n\nIn the *Dading* *jichou* year, Ancestral Master Chongyang, accompanied by Masters Danyang, Changzhen, and Changchun, passed by his home. They were invited in, where a vegetarian feast was prepared in their honor. Later, in his hometown, the Master established Longxiang Abbey, where he maintained daily incense offerings to the Supreme Perfected. On the nineteenth day of the first month in the *Gengxu* year of the *Dading* era, he was born. As a child, he avoided frivolous play. When he reached the age of study, his parents urged him to read, but he replied, \"What I aspire to study is the cultivation of the True beyond the worldly.\" In his twentieth year, his parents sought to arrange his marriage. Upon hearing this, he secluded himself in a quiet chamber and purified himself. His family, recognizing his unshakable resolve, permitted him to don the robes of a Daoist. Soon after, he journeyed to Qixia to study under Ancestral Master Changchun. After long and diligent service, he attained realization in the Dao.\n\nBefore long, he followed Changchun to reside at Wutian Abbey in Laizhou. In the *jimao* year, Emperor Taizu the Sagely and Martial dispatched envoys with an imperial summons for Changchun to journey to the northern court. In the first month of the following spring, the journey commenced, with eighteen disciples selected to accompany him—among them, the Master. Through frost and dew, they traveled back and forth for three years, enduring the hardships of the road. Upon reaching the summit of Mount Jin, they rested briefly in a grove. Changchun turned to Minister Qinghe, Yin, and said, \"This disciple’s nature is pure and earnest; in the future, our teaching may rely heavily upon him.\"\n\nWhen Changchun returned to Yanjing and took residence at Changchun Abbey, the Master served with even greater diligence. After Changchun ascended to immortality, Qinghe succeeded to the seat of teaching and entrusted the Master with the affairs of Changchun Abbey, bestowing upon him the title *Baiyunzi* (\"Master of White Cloud\"). Later, he was dispatched to proselytize in the eastern mountains. Wherever he went, he was ceaselessly welcomed and approached. With kind words, he exhorted the people, and elders from all directions, bearing gifts, filled his hall—too many to count.\n\nIn the spring of the *wuxu* year, Master Zhenchang Li succeeded to the leadership of the teaching. In the fourth month of summer, he entered the imperial court to pay homage, with the Master accompanying him. In the seventh month of autumn, Zhenchang petitioned the throne and received an edict commanding the Master, along with Master Dongzhen Yu, to reside at Chongyang Abbey in Zhongnan Mountain and oversee the affairs of the Daoist teaching in the Shaanxi region. Upon returning to Yanjing, Qinghe said to the Master, \"The words spoken by Changchun on Mount Jin have now come to pass. You must exert yourself diligently, that the work may never cease.\" The Master expressed his gratitude and journeyed west.\n\nIn the *gengzi* year, he led the officials of Jingzhao to Yanjing once more to formally invite Qinghe to preside over the interment of Ancestral Master Chongyang. Thereafter, in the restoration of the ancestral sanctuary, the Master contributed many plans. He also oversaw renovations at Xuandu Wanshou Abbey in the capital of Jingzhao Prefecture and Taiyi Abbey in Tangu Valley.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first month in the *jiachen* year, Prince Kuoduan, the Great King, dispatched his envoy Zhao Chongjian to the abbey to conduct the Golden Register jiao rites, which lasted seven days and nights. When the envoy returned, he reported wondrous signs, prompting the prince to issue a special edict protecting the Mysterious Teaching. All five masters who participated in the rites were bestowed honorific titles, and the Master was conventionally granted the title *Xuemen Hongjiao Baiyun Zhenren* (\"White Cloud Perfected One of the Vast Teaching of the Mysterious Gate\").\n\nIn the winter of the *bingwu* year, the Empress Dowager bestowed upon him a golden crown and robes, granting him exceptional favor. In the *xinhai* year, Emperor Xianzong ascended the throne and issued an imperial edict commanding the Master to continue overseeing the Daoist affairs of the Shaanxi region as before.\n\nIn the winter of the *renzi* year, when the western region of Shu had not yet fully submitted, a reckless individual falsely accused the Daoist community of colluding with the people of Shu. The authorities led troops to conduct a severe investigation, causing the Daoist followers to scatter in terror. In the fourth month of the following summer, when the Sagely Emperor was at the Six Panels traveling palace in his princely residence, the Master went to pay his respects and pleaded the truth of the matter. He received an imperial rescript offering comfort and reassurance, allowing several hundred of his disciples to live in peace. They established over twenty abbeys and temples.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month in the autumn of the *yimao* year, he manifested a minor illness and passed away in the abbot’s chamber of Xuandu Abbey, aged sixty-six. Initially, he was interred at Baiyun Abbey in Fanchuan, but later his remains were relocated to the Immortal’s Transcendence Garden of the Liu-Jiang ancestral sanctuary.\n\n**Perfected One of No Desires**\nThe Master’s ancestral home was in Meiyuan, Yaozhou. His surname was Li, his given name Zhiyuan, and his Daoist name Wuyuzi (\"Master of No Desires\"). He was born on the tenth day of the twelfth month in the *jichou* year of the *Dading* era. At five, he began to walk, and as he grew, he was forthright, resolute, and unyielding, priding himself on his integrity.\n\nIn his hometown, there were cunning and deceitful men, but whenever he confronted them with forthright words, they would gaze at him in awe and submission. He often indulged in wine without restraint, regarding the world as unworthy of his concern. At thirty-seven, he declared: \"Rather than drowning in the dusty halls of this world, why not wander beyond its confines?\" At that time, Yang Bixu was vigorously propagating the teachings of the Quanzhen School in Chang’an. The Master went to meet him. Bixu recognized him as a vessel of great promise for the Daoist gate, yet considering his familial ties, he surmised that the Master might struggle to sever them in his heart. Thus, he sent him home, merely exhorting him to accumulate good deeds.\n\nUpon returning, the Master bid farewell to his relatives and friends, abandoning his wife and children to depart. His wife mocked him, but he merely smiled and paid no heed. When his father saw this and rebuked him, the Master gently explained the learning of life and destiny. His father then understood and, together with the Master, became a disciple at Bixu’s gate. With unkempt hair and tattered robes, the Master begged in the marketplace, and the people of the time called him \"Wine-Loving Master Li.\" In his daily life, he took the cultivation of the self and the benefit of others as his duty.\n\nIn the *gengwu* year of the *Da’an* era, a great drought struck the Qin region, and the starving lay strewn like grass. Relying on the wealth of Zhao Sanlang, a local magnate, the Master persuaded him with kind words. Zhao, awakened, then distributed his stored grain. The Master ordered his Dharma brothers, such as Qi Zhidao, to hull the grain and cook gruel to aid the poor and sick, continuing until autumn when the relief effort ceased.\n\nThereafter, he secluded himself in Huanju of Xingping for a thousand days, attaining great enlightenment. At that time, Jia Gu, the River and Canal Commissioner, invited him to preside over Longxiang Abbey south of the county. The Master accepted and resided there. After five years, he moved to Louguan, then later to Danxia in Jingzhao. Before long, Bixu tasked him with overseeing the construction of Bixu Abbey in Sanyuan.\n\nIn the *wuzǐ* year of the *Zhengda* era, Bixu entrusted the succession of the teaching to the Master before passing away. Shortly after, war broke out in Guanzhong, and the Master led his followers to take refuge in the Southern Mountains. By the spring of the *gengyín* year, he reached Nanyang and met Master Chongxu Li. Dongzhen Yu, hearing of this in Bianjing, dispatched a messenger with a letter, inviting the Master to reside at Danyang Abbey.\n\nIn the *guǐsì* year, Bianjing surrendered, and the city was left in ruins. The people scrambled to cross the river northward. The Master subsequently arrived in Jijun, where he secretly instructed and enlightened the ferrymen, establishing Lingxu and Tianqing Abbeys to aid the multitudes fleeing south. The following year, he traveled to Yan. At that time, Master Qinghe Yin presided over the teaching and entrusted the Master with reviving the ancestral sanctuary in Qin, appointing him as the Supervisor of Daoist Affairs for the Shaanxi Circuit.\n\nAt the outset of his journey, he smelted a measure of gold to fund the initial construction. Passing through Zhao and Wei, nobles and lords came to greet him beyond the city gates, and the wealth and gifts he received were beyond count. All were devoted to the restoration of the ancestral sanctuary. Tian Decan, the Chief Administrator of Jingzhao, along with his assisting officials, met him near Hezhong and offered him the Gude Abbey within the prefectural city as his residence.\n\nAt that time, Guanzhong had only recently been pacified, and violent grudges flared among the people. The area around Liu-Jiang was desolate, with no human traces. The Master led his followers to reclaim and rebuild, laying the foundation of their work. In the spring of the *xīnchǒu* year, during the funeral of the ancestral master, he made many plans and arrangements.\n\nIn the *rényín* year, the scholars of Qin proposed restoring the Confucian temple but lacked tiles. The Master provided all they needed, and the scholars were deeply impressed. In the spring of the *jiǎchén* year, Prince Kuoduan dispatched envoys to the abbey to perform a seven-day-and-night Golden Register Offering. Upon its completion, as per custom, the Master was bestowed the title \"Perfected One of Wondrous Truth of the No Desires Abbey.\"\n\nThat autumn, Hao Zang, the myriarch of Weibei, captured dozens of conspirators plotting to flee south. Upon uncovering their crimes, he intended to execute them all. The Master rode through the night to intercede, explaining the principles of sin and fortune, and all were spared. The following year, a small band of outlaws in Jingzhao secretly fled. The prefect, Han Yuan, proposed executing them in the marketplace to deter others. The Master, however, advised that only the ringleaders should be punished.\n\nWhen the mother of Yila Baojian, the Grand Tutor, died, he wished to bury two maidservants with her. The Master corrected this with the ancient rites of burial, and the practice was abolished. In the *bǐngwǔ* year, he journeyed to Yan and stayed beneath the Incense Hall. In the fourth month of summer, he returned, passing through Bianjing and lodging at Danyang Abbey. There, he suddenly appeared anxious. His disciples hurried out, and scarcely had they traveled a short distance when the Song army arrived at the city gates. Such was the nature of his foresight.\n\nIn the autumn of the following year, the empress bestowed upon him the honor of a cap and robe. In the spring of the *jiǎyín* year, Master Zhenchang Li, who presided over the teaching, summoned the Master with a letter regarding the Universal Offering. Though he was eighty-six, he dared not decline on account of his age. Upon arriving in Yan, his illness worsened. On the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month, he passed away peacefully in the Fanghu Chamber of Changchun Abbey. His disciples carried his coffin west and interred him in the Immortal’s Transcendence Garden of Liu-Jiang.\n\nThroughout his life, though he did not study books, the gentry and officials of all regions held him in great esteem. In Yan, he associated with Wanqing, Dan You, Zhao Furen, Jing Xuan, and Ding Chen. In Qin, he was close to Ziyang Yang Huan, Yao Zuoxia Shu, and Lai Xian, as well as Minister Ming’s Na Bangyong and others. They all composed elegies in verse, wrote memorial essays, and had them inscribed on stone in the Jingfu Hall of Youde Abbey. Reading them, one can glimpse the depth of his Daoist practice in his daily life.\n\n**Perfected One of Perfect Clarity**\nThe Master’s surname was Gao, his personal name Daokuan, and his courtesy name Yuzhi. His family was a prominent clan of Huairen County in Yingzhou. He was of imposing stature and magnanimous bearing. He was born on the nineteenth day of the seventh month in the *yǐmǎo* year of the *Mingchang* era.\n\nIn his youth, he did not join other children in their boisterous play. As he grew older, he studied books and mastered the essentials of the classics and histories. His nature inclined toward elegance and simplicity, and he often harbored thoughts of transcending the mundane and withdrawing from the world. Yet with both parents still living, he could not fulfill his aspirations. When the wars of the *Da’an* era erupted, the clouds and winds of strife swept through his homeland, so he took his family to seek refuge in Chang’an, where he concealed himself as a petty clerk. After his parents passed away, he observed the mourning rites with full propriety.\n\nOne evening, he sat exposed in the courtyard. As midnight approached, he suddenly beheld a radiance as bright as day. Looking up to the northwest, he saw the gates of heaven swing wide open, and amidst crimson clouds and emerald mists, jade forests, gem-like trees, jeweled halls, and jasper terraces appeared before his eyes in vivid detail—only to vanish again in an instant. From that moment, his resolve to pursue the Dao grew ever more fervent.\n\nIn the *xīnsì* year of the *Xīngdìng* era, he heard that An Jun of Penglai Hermitage on Zhangtai Street was a Perfected One of the Quanzhen tradition. He immediately abandoned his home and worldly ties, becoming An Jun’s disciple. An Jun, admiring his determination, taught him that crushing arrogance, tempering aggression, and curbing desires to cultivate the mind were the foundations of self-cultivation. The Master reverently embraced these profound instructions, wearing tattered robes and subsisting on coarse fare, yet savoring the Dao and contemplating truth with serene contentment.\n\nWhen the *Zhèngdà* era began, he traveled to Bianliang and took refuge under Master Chongxu Li of Danyang Abbey, seeking to advance in the Dao. Chongxu set him to laborious tasks to accumulate merit and virtue. For years, the Master diligently performed the duties of tending the stove and drawing water without respite, until Chongxu imparted to him the essentials of the Dao.\n\nIn the *bǐngxū* year, the Jin ruler dispatched an imperial envoy to Fengxiang to summon Master Dongzhen Yu. He also commanded Li Chongxu to select a disciplined Daoist to accompany him. Chongxu summoned the Master and said: “The bond between master and disciple is ordained by hidden principle. Dongzhen is my friend beyond the world; he once received the true seal of approval from Masters Danyang and Changchun, and is a patriarch of the Mysterious Gate. Now the emperor has issued a summons, and you shall go with him. In the days to come, when our tradition flourishes, it will be through your efforts that the Dao is accomplished. This is the man—revere him well.” The Master received his instructions and departed.\n\nAfter Dongzhen arrived in Bian, he was appointed to oversee the Central Taiyi Abbey. The Master served under him, paying homage in the morning and seeking counsel in the evening, advancing in his study of the Dao, virtue, nature, and destiny. When Bianjing fell in the *guǐsì* year, the Master crossed north to the capital of Yan, then took up residence in Longyang Abbey in Dexing, nurturing his spirit and cultivating his vital force, as if intending to remain there for life.\n\nIn the spring of the *wùxū* year, Dongzhen summoned him back to Yan to expound the teachings at Bailiu. In the winter of the *gēngzǐ* year, he followed Dongzhen into the Pass to restore the ancestral sanctuary on Mount Zhongnan. During the preparations for the ancestral master’s interment, the Master contributed in many ways, aiding and supporting the endeavor.\n\nIn the *wùshēn* year, Dongzhen bestowed upon him the title *Yuanmingzi* and appointed him to administer Chongyang Wanshou Abbey and oversee the affairs of Ganhe Yuxian Abbey. Dongzhen told him: “People often believe that sitting in stillness and quieting the mind are the sole means of advancing in the Dao. Yet those who attain the highest understanding cultivate both stillness and activity, essence and function, in perfect harmony—remaining tranquil amid motion, finding serenity in disturbance, acting without acting, engaging in affairs without entanglement, blending with the world while preserving their inner light. This is the subtle essence of the Old Master’s teaching. Now that the Mysterious Transformation flourishes, you must uphold this principle, respond to circumstances to support the tradition, and benefit beings to lay the foundation for attaining the truth and realizing the Dao. In the future, you will bear great responsibility for our teaching. Though affairs may press upon you, do not shrink from them—all this will refine you for your ultimate accomplishment.” The Master knelt, bowed his head, and replied: “The immortal’s wondrous teachings are beyond the ken of ordinary mortals. Today, I receive your instruction and shall conduct myself accordingly.”\n\nFrom then on, he governed himself with frugality and treated others with generosity. Within a few years, all within and beyond the tradition, without exception, held him in affection. Those who recognized his worth marveled at Dongzhen’s discernment in choosing him.\n\nIn the spring of the *rénzǐ* year, Master Zhenchang Li, the presiding Perfected One, conducted rites at the ancestral sanctuary and appointed the Master as the Daoist Registrar of the Jingzhao Circuit. He served in this role for a decade, fulfilling his duties without fail.\n\nBy the *xīnyǒu* year of the *Zhōngtǒng* era, when Perfected One Chengming Zhang journeyed to the imperial court to secure an appointment, the Master was recommended and granted the title of *Tídian* (Supervisor) of Daoist Affairs for Shaanxi, Xingyuan, and other circuits, concurrently administering Chongyang Wanshou Abbey.\n\nIn the summer of the *wùchén* year of the *Zhìyuán* era, the imperial nephew Prince Yongchang bestowed upon him a golden crown and brocade robes. In the *xīnwèi* year, Perfected One Chunzhen Wang, the succeeding presiding master, conferred upon him the posthumous title *Zhīcháng Bàodé Yuánmíng Zūnshī* (Venerable Master of Constant Awareness, Embracing Virtue, and Perfect Clarity).\n\nShortly thereafter, Prince Yongchang again bestowed upon him the title *Dòngguān Pǔjì Yuánmíng Zhēnrén* (Perfected One of Perfect Clarity, Pervasive Salvation, and Penetrating Observation).\n\nIn the spring of the *guǐyǒu* year, the imperial son Prince Anxi established his headquarters at Liupan. Upon their first meeting, the Master’s responses pleased the prince, who then recommended and bestowed upon him a ceremonial cap and robes.\n\nIn the summer of the *yǐhài* year, the Master was summoned to the imperial encampment to conduct the grand *Jīnlù Luótiān* ritual. From the day the rites began until their conclusion, auspicious clouds swirled overhead, and numinous signs manifested clearly—all recorded in the *Tóulóngcè* stele composed by Minister Shang, and thus not repeated here.\n\nBefore long, the empress dowager also bestowed upon him ceremonial robes, along with gracious and generous decrees.\n\nIn the autumn of the *bǐngzǐ* year, Prince Anxi issued an imperial edict entrusting him with the administration of all Daoist affairs in western Shu.\n\nFor twenty years, the Master oversaw the teaching with a focus on virtue and transformation, never once resorting to punitive measures. At the ancestral sanctuary, he oversaw the construction of the Southern Prosperity Upper Abbey and the Great Hall of the Five Patriarchs, along with numerous renovations to kitchens, storehouses, and stables. Even when a single novice sought his counsel, he received them with courtesy, never displaying arrogance or self-satisfaction. Though his duties were onerous, he responded to every matter with discernment, aligning each with its proper principle.\n\nEach night, he would compose his spirit in quiet meditation until dawn, never sleeping—his practice of refining and nurturing the truth became his constant discipline. Thus, though he lived past eighty, he remained vigorous in step and full of vitality. From princes and nobles to common folk, none failed to treat him with exceptional reverence. As a result, the teaching remained serene and orderly, the community of Daoists at peace, and those who benefited in hidden ways from his influence were beyond count.\n\nIn the spring of the *dingchou* year, during the first ten days of the first lunar month, he suddenly fell mildly ill. His attendants urged him to take medicine, but the Master said: \"Life and death are like morning and evening—this is the constant principle of all things. How could medicine or stone prolong what is not mine by fate?\" By the twenty-fourth day, he ceased eating, yet sat upright all day, speaking as usual. He only instructed others with words on advancing in the Dao. The following day, he peacefully transformed in his quiet chamber, having lived eighty-three springs and autumns.\n\nFive days later, he was interred in the Immortal’s Shedding Garden of the abbey. Over ten thousand Daoists and laypeople followed his funeral procession—a testament to the power of his lifelong cultivation. Thus concludes the *Inner Transmission of the Immortals and Perfected of the Ancestral Court of Mount Zhongnan*, Scroll the Lower.",

When the immortal of Mount Taibai (太白) revealed his transcendent bones, none would have recognized him as an extraordinary man had not Sima Ziwei (司马子微) discerned his true nature.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao conceal themselves in cliffs and valleys, dwelling in thatched huts, clad in coarse robes while harboring jade-like virtue. Though they possess talents vast as the warp and weft of the cosmos, they are not employed by the world, content to perfect themselves in tranquility. Yet after a thousand years, how many remain unknown? Of a thousand or ten thousand, how many meet the misfortune of obscurity, perishing unheard, rotting like grass and trees? How lamentable!\n\nFortunately, there are those who, out of devotion, record their lives in biographies. Yet often, these accounts exaggerate their deeds, rendering them unbelievable to later generations. I fear that the hearts of recluses do not hasten to seek obscurity or perform wonders to astonish the ears and eyes of others.\n\nWhat the world truly values in those who refine themselves as immortals lies not in riding clouds and mist, straddling the Tail of the Winnowing Basket (箕尾), parting water and fire, commanding crows to remove their caps, lifting their dwellings into the heavens, or achieving liberation in a single sitting or standing. Rather, it is in unwavering adherence to the Dao, secretly aiding others with merit, rectifying their bearing to awaken all beings, and abiding in harmony with the times.\n\nI have observed that in the old biographies of the *Arrayed Immortals*, *Comprehensive Immortals*, and *Lofty Daoists*, none escaped such embellishments—yet these works no longer survive. Now, the Perfected of Heavenly Music (天乐真人), Master Li Fu (李复), has compiled in his leisure the conduct and deeds of the departed masters and perfected who once dwelled in the ancestral court, arranging them into a separate record. This allows later generations to know their origins and roots. His words are direct and true, plain and clear, entirely free of exaggeration or artifice. Truly, this work can illuminate the hidden radiance of their virtue and serve as a model for later learners. How shallow could its purpose be?\n\nLong ago, Academician Liu (刘翰林) inscribed the immortal traces of the ancestral master on a stele, remarking: \"The master’s feats—exiting the body, entering dreams, tossing aside his umbrella, discarding his cap, and other acts of soaring, vanishing, and transformation—were but expedient means, not the essence of his teachings.\" Ah! If later scholars can embody the ancestral master’s苦志 (*ardent resolve*), refine their conduct, propagate transformation, and save others, thereby achieving both self-cultivation and the cultivation of others, then future chroniclers will naturally render just judgment. There is no need to claim exclusivity for our ancestral court.\n\nComposed on the second day of the second month in the *jiashen* year of the Zhiyuan era (至元甲申岁二月初吉), by Wang Daoming (王道明), Grand Master of Manifesting Constant Virtue (知常盛德大师), Supervisor of the Yuxian Palace at Ganhe Town, Mount Zhongnan.\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One of *The Esoteric Biographies of the Immortals and Perfected of the Ancestral Court of Mount Zhongnan***\nCompiled by Li Daoqian (李道谦), the Daoist of Heavenly Music of Yi Mountain (夷山天乐道人)",

      "translated_text": "The Perfected Jade Toad (玉蟾真人)\n\nThe master’s secular surname was He (和), given name Dejin (德瑾), a native of Ganquan County in Qinzhou. Endowed with an elegant and refined nature, he devoted himself to literary studies in his youth and later withdrew from the world upon reaching adulthood. Though he served as a clerk versed in legal documents, he conducted himself with uprightness in all matters. His heart abided in the Dao, and he never took wealth that was not rightfully his. Whenever he encountered lofty persons or eminent scholars, he would invariably seek their counsel.\n\nDuring the Tiande era, when he was considering entering the path of officialdom, a Daoist suddenly passed by his door. The master invited him into his home, poured wine, and discoursed on the mysteries, greatly pleasing the Daoist’s sensibilities. After a short while, the Daoist departed. Another day, the Daoist returned, carrying a horned owl on his arm. He said to the master, “Though this creature has such large eyes, it utterly fails to recognize people.” The master then realized this was no ordinary person. He inquired after the Daoist’s hometown and name, but the Daoist left without answering.\n\nOver a month later, the Daoist returned, afflicted with a severe illness, and stayed at the master’s home. His body was covered in pus, blood, and filth, making it nearly unbearable to approach. The master summoned physicians, but no treatment proved effective. After a year, the Daoist passed away, and the master prepared a proper burial with full rites.\n\nSeveral months later, an elderly woman arrived at his door, weeping as she spoke: “This old woman has a son who is by nature fond of wandering like clouds and water, neglecting his family duties. I recently learned he was staying at your esteemed residence and came especially to find him.” The master informed her of the Daoist’s illness and death. The woman wailed inconsolably, saying, “This old woman and my son were our only two mouths to feed. Now that he is dead, where shall I find refuge?” The master offered to serve her as his own mother.\n\nOne day, the woman said, “I wish to open the coffin to see my son’s face once more. Even in death, I would have no regrets.” After repeated entreaties, the master had the grave opened, only to find an empty coffin. Inside lay a single secret missive, and the old woman had vanished without a trace.\n\nThe master sighed and said, “I have now encountered a true immortal, yet I remain mired in the dusty hall of the world. What am I truly here for?” From that moment, he cast aside his wife and children, changed his attire, and entered the Daoist path.\n\nAt that time, he heard that the Ancestral Master Chongyang had also encountered a perfected being and was residing on Mount Zhongnan. He went to pay his respects and seek instruction. In the third year of the Dading era, he built a thatched hut in Liujiang Village, living together with Lord Lingyang Li and two others. Gradually, his mind became perfectly attuned, and he attained the profound mysteries.\n\nIn the seventh year, *dinghai* (丁亥), when Chongyang journeyed to the eastern seas, the master and Lingyang remained to dwell in the Dao. In the spring of the tenth year, *gengyin* (庚寅), when the Four Perfected—Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu—were about to arrive, the master and Li Lingyang were then residing at the Taiping Palace on Mount Zhongnan. They left money with a noodle vendor, saying, “Today, four immortal guests—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—will arrive. Treat them well.”\n\nAfter some time, the four indeed arrived. The noodle vendor invited them in, saying, “Are you gentlemen not Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma?” The four looked at one another and smiled, asking, “How do you know this?” The vendor replied, “Masters He and Li have already left money for your noodles.” The four sighed in wonder. After eating, they went to meet the masters, and all were deeply harmonious in their encounter.\n\nThe master once instructed a painter to depict his true form, sleeping atop a tiger, though none could fathom its meaning. In the ninth month of autumn, the master suddenly felt his Dao-body unwell. Danyang ordered Changchun to attend to him. By the fourteenth day, his illness resolved, and he peacefully transformed.\n\nThe Four Perfected buried him beside the Liujiang Hermitage. The painting of the tiger-sleeping figure signified that the time of his ascension, marked by the cyclical year *yin* (寅), was revealed at the crown of his head.\n\nAfter his ascension, a certain Lord Zhang of Lintong had long suffered from a wind illness. No physician could cure him, and as he neared his final moments, he dreamed the master arrived at his door and instructed him in a method of treatment. When asked his name, the master replied, “I am He Yuchan of Mount Zhongnan.” Upon waking, his illness had slightly improved. He used the remedy prescribed in the dream, and his illness was indeed swiftly cured.",

      "translated_text": "Lord Zhang of Jiufeng Hermitage held a vegetarian feast and built a pavilion to repay his kindness. The posthumous title bestowed upon him was *Yuchan Puming Chengji Zhenren* (\"Perfected One of Universal Clarity and Serene Quiescence\"). Today, an inscribed stele from the ancestral temple still remains.\n\nPerfected One Lingyang’s surname was Li, a native of Zhongnan County in Jingzhao. Exceptionally intelligent and quick-witted, his learning was vast and comprehensive. After an encounter with an extraordinary figure during the Tiande reign, he became detached, no longer concerning himself with family affairs. He regarded wealth and honor as floating clouds, and fame and profit as mere shackles. Roaming among springs and rocks, he found joy in the Dao, concealing his brilliance and shunning recognition. Thus, he never revealed his given name throughout his life, and the villagers simply called him *Li Zhenren* (\"Perfected One Li\").\n\nIn the third year of the Dading era, he, along with Ancestral Master Chongyang and He Yuchan, built thatched huts beside the Liujiang Hermitage. In his studies of lead, mercury, dragon, and tiger, he relied heavily on Chongyang’s guidance. In the summer of the seventh year (Dinghai), when Chongyang journeyed to the eastern seas, the master and He Yuchan remained at Liujiang to cultivate themselves and interact with others. Chongyang, upon reaching Bian, sent them a poem as a message. He Yuchan and Li had long shared a single aspiration, and their bond with Chongyang was evidently one of profound fellowship.\n\nBy the spring of the tenth year, Chongyang ascended as an immortal in Bianliang. The Four Perfected—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—entered Guanzhong and treated the two masters with the respect due to uncles. That autumn, Yuchan also departed through transformation, and the master remained with the assembly of perfected ones.\n\nIn the spring of the twenty-eighth year, on the first month, Master Qiu Changchun received an imperial summons to the court. As he took his leave, the master exhorted him, saying: “Chongyang once said you would surely expand the Mysterious Teaching—now is the time. Take care of yourself, and if the crane-drawn chariot returns early next spring, I shall await you to preside over my funeral rites.” In the eighth month, Changchun received the imperial decree to return to Zhongnan. That winter, he lingered among the mountains south of the Huai and the regions of Luo. The following spring, in the second month, as he journeyed west and passed through the outskirts of E and Qin渡镇, the local Daoist community entreated him to stay for several days. A fortnight earlier, the master had been in good health, yet he ceased eating grain. When questioned, he replied: “Do not worry for me; I await only the funeral presider.” He immediately dispatched someone to urge Changchun to return swiftly. Upon arrival, Changchun bowed at the master’s bedside, whereupon the master bestowed upon him an inkstick. Changchun understood his intent and ordered craftsmen to prepare a coffin. Before it was completed, the master peacefully transformed, on the first day of the third month. Changchun buried him with due rites beside the hermitage’s immortal burial ground, and his posthumous title was reverently inscribed as *Lingyang Huiyao Yanhua Zhenren* (\"Perfected One of Radiant Brilliance and Transformative Illumination\").\n\nMaster Liu Tongwei’s surname was Liu, his given name Tongwei, and his courtesy name Yuedao; his Daoist name was *Moranzi*.

      "translated_text": "In his youth, he indulged in falconry, coursing hounds, cockfighting, and gambling, lost in the pleasures of flowers and wine. One day, he fell gravely ill, nearly beyond salvation. In a dream, he entered the realm of immortals, and upon recovery, he awakened to the principle of illusory transformation, holding the Dao in his heart.\n\nIn the summer of the *dinghai* year of the Dading era, Ancestral Master Chongyang was to journey to the eastern seas. Passing through Yecheng, he saw that Master Liu’s spirit was bright and transcendent, bearing the demeanor of one who might ascend to the clouds. Engaging him in conversation, their minds met in perfect accord. Chongyang imparted to him the secret instructions of cultivating truth and bestowed upon him his present name and style. Once Liu received this transmission, he immediately abandoned his home and family. Carrying a staff, he entered the Guanzhong region and built a thatched hut beside Gangu in the Zhongnan Mountains. There, he howled with the wind, chanted to the moon, rested his head upon rocks, and rinsed his mouth with flowing streams, roaming free beyond the dust of the world.\n\nIn the spring of the *gengyin* year, the four masters—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—came from the west. Master Liu rejoiced in their company and together they renovated the Liu-Jiang Hermitage. Later, the four masters journeyed to Bianliang, bearing Ancestral Master Chongyang’s immortal remains for burial beside the hermitage. Master Liu kept vigil at the graveside for three years before traveling north to the Lan-Guan region. Within, he embodied the wondrous subtleties of the Dao; without, he responded to the world’s needs. Those who came in Daoist robes seeking instruction filled his hall daily. Thus, he established an abbey to initiate disciples, and the mystic wind flourished on the western mountains. His illustrious reputation spread far, reaching the imperial capital.\n\nAt the beginning of the Mingchang era, Emperor Daoling summoned him to the palace and inquired about the ninefold cyclings and sevenfold refinements. Master Liu replied, “These are the pursuits of mountain recluses and rustics. Your Majesty, enthroned as the lord of the ninefold realm and sovereign of all within the four seas, need not dwell on such matters. It suffices to embrace the essentials of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi—clarity, stillness, non-action—in cultivating the self and governing the state.” The emperor was pleased and ordered him lodged at the Tianchang Abbey, later transferring him to the Yongshou Daoist Monastery. There, he expounded the Dao, and scholars of the Three Teachings and the Nine Schools thronged to his gate, their sandals filling the courtyard. Before long, he received an imperial decree permitting his return to the mountains, and the emperor bestowed upon him calligraphic scrolls to honor his journey.\n\nHe soared between Qi and Lu until, arriving at Nie Family Village in Shanghe County of Bozhou, he told his disciples, “This is where I shall rest.” He then renovated a dwelling and took up residence. One day, he burned incense and paid homage to the sages, gathering his followers to impart final instructions on cultivating truth. He said, “The summons of the Perfected has arrived; I must depart.” Suddenly, he transformed in quiet repose. It was the fifteenth day of the second month of the first year of the Cheng’an era, the *Zhenyuan* Festival. His lifetime of poems and lyrics, titled *The Complete Dao Collection*, circulated in the world. At the site of his immortal transformation, the grand Chaoyuan Palace was later built.\n\nMaster Shi Chuhou’s ancestral home was in Liquan of Qianzhou; his surname was Shi, his given name Gongmi. From childhood, he yearned for the supreme Dao. In the *renwu* year of the Dading era, hearing that Ancestral Master Chongyang had encountered immortals and received secret instructions, cultivating the Dao in Zhongnan, he hastened to seek initiation and was graciously accepted. Chongyang taught him the study of the perfected nature and destiny of the Quanzhen tradition and bestowed upon him the name Chuhou and the style Dongyangzi. Thereafter, he begged for alms to refine his heart, wandering between Zhongnan and Eshe.\n\nIn the spring of the *dinghai* year, Chongyang was to journey to the eastern seas and wished for him to accompany him.

In his youth, he studied the Confucian classics, aspiring to purity and emptiness. Yet with his parents still living, he could not rise above worldly concerns. Serving as a legal officer in the county, he approached his duties with compassion.\n\nOne evening on his way home, he found a discarded scroll by the road, titled *The Jade Numinous Scripture*, with the inscription: \"He who obtains this shall become an immortal.\" Thereupon, he burned incense and vowed: \"Now in my twenty-ninth year, I swear to purify myself and enter the Dao upon reaching the age of unconfusion.\" After the prayer, he poured wine into the ritual basin, where a sound arose like distant thunder—his family all marveled at the omen.\n\nLater, after twelve years had passed, both his parents passed away. Suddenly afflicted with an eye ailment, his condition worsened with treatment. He reproached himself in silence: \"Once I obtained the sacred scripture and vowed to leave home at forty—now the time has passed. Once this illness eases, I shall follow the Dao.\" Soon after, his vision cleared as before.\n\nHe then journeyed to Liujiang in Zhongnan, where he sought out Patriarch Chongyang, entreating to be accepted as a disciple. This was in the *guiwei* year of Dading. Once granted admission, the Master devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Dao. Over several years, the Patriarch imparted to him its subtle principles.\n\nIn the summer of the *dinghai* year, the Patriarch traveled east. The Master wandered among Zhongnan’s springs and rocks, dwelling in places that nurtured his spirit and cultivated his vital qi. In the tenth year, when the Four Masters—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—entered Guanzhong, he received further affirmation from Master Danyang, who also bestowed upon him a willow-branch poem:\n\n*\"One tiger, one dragon sleep in one place,*\n*Whirling in play.*\n*One breath, one inhalation complete one celestial cycle,*\n*Encompassing the Three Fields.*\n*One wheat, one hemp thread through one line,*\n*Swaying with auspicious mist.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Master Cao traveled through the examination halls and repeatedly placed among the highest selections. In the *jiayin* year of the Dading era (1194), during a day of leisure, he perused Daoist scriptures and classics. Closing the scroll, he sighed: “Human life in this floating world passes like lightning, fleeting in an instant. If one does not explore the wondrous origin of existence before birth, what purpose do lofty aspirations serve?” Though he harbored the aspiration to study the Dao, he knew not where to turn.\n\nHearing that Master Danyang resided in a humble abode at the ancestral court of Zhongnan, the Master journeyed there directly. Upon their first meeting, their spirits harmonized and their *qi* aligned, as if bound by a predestined affinity. Danyang welcomed him into his discipleship and taught him the essentials of the Dao. The Master, having received this guidance, knew that encountering a perfected being was no easy matter. Thus, he relinquished his ambitions for worldly advancement and pledged lifelong devotion.\n\nDanyang recognized the Master’s transcendent spirit and profound insight. One day, as the Master sat in silent meditation in his chamber, striving for stillness, Danyang visited him and asked: “Is your learning advancing?” The Master bowed deeply and knelt before him, saying: “I wish to advance, yet I have not yet attained it.” Danyang replied: “Stillness is the origin of Heaven’s mandate and the foundation of immortals and sages. To cultivate and advance in it is like borrowing wings to ascend the heavens. To reflect and delve deeply is like sitting in a hall and gazing upon the steps before you. Without striving for stillness, you will be serene yet untroubled. Without striving for truth, you will act without delusion.”\n\nThe Master bowed in gratitude and said: “I have grasped it. From now on, I will trust without doubt and perceive without obscurity. From ancient times to the present, the unbroken thread of transmission—does it not refer to this?” Danyang nodded in approval, and the Master bowed twice more before withdrawing.\n\nLater, the first among the ten *jieyuan* of the Mystery Gate (*xuanmen*) originated with the Master. Whenever newcomers entered the Dao, Danyang regarded the Master as their elder brother. In the *renyin* year (1182), Danyang prepared to return to Ninghai, and the Master accompanied him. The following year, Danyang ascended as an immortal, and the Master succeeded him in propagating the Dao along the coast.\n\nDuring the Mingchang era (1190–1196), at the behest of Master Changchun, he joined Su of Yunzhong and Liu the Unsullied in flying to Wu, Yan, and Ji, where they expounded the Dao, transformed lives, and responded to circumstances with boundless compassion. For over a decade, the mysterious transformation flourished. In the summer of the *dingmao* year of the Taihe era (1217), the fourth month, while residing at the Yongshou Abbey in the eastern part of the Yan capital, the Master suddenly addressed his disciples: “I shall return now.” Within days, he manifested a slight illness and passed away. The Daoist community prepared rites and interred him east of the abbey after the war.\n\nIn the winter of the *yisi* year (1225), his remains were reburied on Wuhua Mountain. In the *gengxu* year (1230), by imperial decree, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Perfected of Illuminating Mystery, Upright Virtue, and Morning Emptiness, at the request of the Perfected of True Constancy, who presided over the teachings.\n\n---\n\nMaster Lai Lingyu hailed from a prominent family of the right district of Jingzhao. His surname was Lai, his given name Lingyu, and his Daoist name Zhenyangzi. From childhood, he studied Confucian classics, and his village addressed him as *jieyuan*. In the tenth year of the Dading era (1170), he took leave of Master Danyang to become a Daoist. When Danyang later returned to the coast, the Master accompanied him. No further records of his later activities survive; here, only the broad outlines are noted. Should more details emerge, they shall be recorded in full.\n\n---\n\nMaster Lei Datong’s surname was Lei, his given name Datong, and his Daoist name Hongyangzi. His family was a great clan of Fuzheng in Yan’an. Tall of stature, with an elegant and detached demeanor, he paid no heed to trivial matters. His brows were sparse, his eyes bright, his ears large and straight, his lips as red as cinnabar, and his beard fine and handsome.\n\nFrom youth, he studied Confucianism and once topped the local examinations in poetry and rhapsody, earning the title *jieyuan*. In the spring of the *yiwei* year of the Dading era (1175), as he read late into the night, the lamp burned bright, the moon shone clear, and the wind was gentle. As the third watch neared, he suddenly heard the sound of a staff tracing the ground outside his window, followed by a voice saying:\n\n*“Alas for the foolish and deluded, laboring in vain—*\n*Fleeting glory, a dream turned to emptiness in an instant.*\n*How much better to set one’s resolve on cultivating immortality,*\n*And dwell forever in the highest palace of the Three Mountains!”*\n\nThe Master flung open the door and looked out, but saw nothing. Holding a candle, he examined the ground and found four lines of verse traced by a staff, followed by the characters *cha xi* (forked path). From that moment, he awakened to the emptiness of worldly splendor and resolved to study the Dao.\n\nThat autumn, while traveling to Chang’an for the examinations, he heard that Master Danyang was expounding the teachings of the Quanzhen school at the ancestral court of Zhongnan. He went to pay his respects, and at their first meeting, they felt as if bound by a predestined affinity. He composed two quatrains expressing his aspirations and presented them to Danyang. The Master responded in kind, matching the rhyme:\n\n*“Though your renown surpasses Su Qin’s,*\n*It is not like concealing your light and hiding your name.*\n*Beyond the world, carefree and unburdened,*\n*At first awakening, the light of nature shines clear.*\n\n*Stillness and purity are the secrets of longevity,*\n*Passed down without words, forsaking wife and children.*\n*Once enlightened, how can one cling to existence?*\n*Naturally, the finest causes and conditions arise.”*\n\nThe Master burned incense, bowed, and requested to become a disciple. Danyang kept him by his side and instructed him in the present and future significance of the Dao. Morning and evening, he sought the Way and made great progress.\n\nIn the summer of the *renyin* year (1182), when Danyang prepared to return to the coast, the Master remained at the ancestral court, advancing in his Daoist practice. In the spring of the *jiachen* year (1184), hearing that Danyang had ascended as an immortal and was wandering the coast with staff and sandals, he traveled to pay his respects at the master’s tomb. By the beginning of the Mingchang era (1190), he gradually made his way west, passing through Teng Prefecture. Enamored of the secluded valleys and towering peaks of Fengshan, he built a hermitage for cultivation at Xiangshi Gully. There, he nurtured his true nature, preserved his vast *qi*, and propagated the Dao to transform lives. Thereafter, hundreds of disciples came to his door to receive his teachings.",

      "translated_text": "The Perfected Lingzhen, Ma Liaodao, and the Perfected Qingming, Wang Zhizhuan, having entered the inner chamber of the lineage, now established their own abodes to guide and receive later generations.\n\nIn the autumn of the *xinsi* year of the Da’an era (1211), the Master addressed his disciples, saying: \"The cycle of a hundred and six has reached its end, and the calamities of the kalpa are now upon us. Living beings are as fish on the chopping block—I cannot bear to remain in the world.\" Shortly thereafter, he manifested a minor illness and passed away. His disciples buried him beside the Cultivation Hermitage. Before long, war and chaos erupted, and smoke from beacon fires filled the valleys. Later, when the Great Yuan pacified the land and the populace gradually gathered again, in the *gengxu* year (1250), the Master’s eminent disciple, the Perfected Qingxu, Zhang Zhidong, arrived from Wuchuan. Seeing the Master’s burial site—humble in scale and overgrown with weeds—he convened the four directions’ disciples and kin. They prepared robes and a stone outer coffin, then reinterred him in the Immortal’s Burial Ground at the Divine Capital Palace on Snow Mountain. His disciples, Ma Lingzhen and Wang Qingming, were positioned to his left and right, and a hall was constructed with an image to maintain the incense offerings.\n\n**Master Liu Zhenyi**\nMaster Liu Zhenyi, whose surname was Liu and personal name Zhenyi, bore the Daoist name Langranzi. His family, a prominent household of Huang County in Dengzhou, had risen through Confucian scholarship, accumulating virtue and revering the Dao, earning the praise of their village. Orphaned of his father in youth, the Master read voraciously, memorizing thousands of words daily, his literary talent vast and profound. In his early twenties, he sat for the spring examinations and placed among the highest ranks, earning the title *jieyuan* from his contemporaries. Yet he regarded worldly affairs as unworthy of attachment, ever harboring lofty and transcendent aspirations. Suddenly, he contracted a debilitating illness of chronic diarrhea, lingering for over a year. Even the most potent medicines failed to cure him.\n\nIn the autumn of the *jichou* year of the Dading era (1169), Ancestor Chongyang, accompanied by the Three Perfected—Danyang, Changzhen, and Changchun—passed by his home. His mother prepared a vegetarian feast to honor them and informed them of her son’s illness. The Ancestor examined him and declared: \"This is a great being of my lineage, not merely your family’s son. If you permit him to enter the Dao, he may yet recover.\" His mother burned incense and knelt before him, saying: \"If this illness is truly cured, I shall have him attend you in your old age.\" The Ancestor gave him the remnants of his drink. After consuming it, the Master’s sweat poured forth like a bath, and his illness gradually abated.\n\nBy the following year, the Ancestor had ascended as an immortal in Bianliang. The Master entered the Pass and journeyed to Liujiang Village in Zhongnan to pay homage to Master Danyang. He left the household life, served the Master, and after a long time, received the transmission of the profound teachings. In the summer of the *renyin* year (1182), he returned east with Danyang. In the winter of the *guimao* year (1183), as Danyang prepared to ascend as an immortal, he summoned the Master and instructed him: \"If you wish to become immortals, you must accumulate merit and virtuous deeds. Even if you encounter a thousand demons and ten thousand hardships, take care not to retreat or falter. Only then can you comprehend my words. Whether my eyes are open or closed, I see all. The seeing does not lie in the eyes; if the heart is perfectly clear, nothing remains unseen.\" He added: \"Your destiny lies in the north. You may go there.\" The Master bowed in gratitude.\n\nAfter Danyang ascended as an immortal, the Master wandered north to the lands of Ping and Luan. Wherever he went, those seeking his teachings filled the courtyards. One day, he reached Funing County, enamored of its fine mountains and waters, and built the Chongyang Abbey to reside there. Thereafter, he initiated thousands of disciples and established over three hundred temples and abbeys, large and small. The flourishing of the Dao in the north owed much to his efforts.\n\nOn the sixth day of the second month in the *bingyin* year of the Taihe era (1206), he summoned his inner-chamber disciples, Di Daoming and others, saying: \"I shall soon depart. Recall the words Danyang spoke to me before his ascension—let none of you forget them. The *Collection of Gold and Jade* is essential reading for all who enter the Dao. Have it carved into printing blocks and disseminated widely.\" Moments later, he peacefully passed away. His lifetime of songs and poems, titled *The Responsive Karma Collection*, circulated in the world.\n\n**Master Li Dacheng**\nMaster Li Dacheng, whose surname was Li, hailed from a great clan of Huating County in Pingdong Prefecture. In his youth, he studied Confucian classics and excelled in literary composition. In his early years, he passed the local examinations, but by middle age, he failed the imperial examinations. With a sigh, he harbored aspirations for the misty mountains.\n\nIn the autumn of the *wuxu* year of the Dading era (1178), Master Danyang traveled west to propagate the Dao. The Master invited him to his private residence, where Danyang discoursed daily on the wonders of the Dao. Thereupon, the Master dismissed his wife, abandoned his burdens, changed his attire, and became Danyang’s disciple. Danyang bestowed upon him the name Dacheng and the Daoist title Lingyangzi. Day by day, he received the true teachings, plumbing their profound depths.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the second month in the *jihai* year (1179), Danyang built a walled hermitage in the Master’s flower garden and resided there with him for a hundred days. He presented the Master with a poem:\n*In the northwest, a walled hermitage stands by the river,*\n*Here I may conceal my form.*\n*Before me, noble bamboo—several gentlemen,*\n*Facing verdant pines—two great men.*\n*Flowing water and artificial hills—mere child’s play,*\n*But do you understand the clear wind and bright moon?*\n*If you can grasp the meaning of my planted leeks,*\n*You may share in the radiant light bound for the Jade Capital.*\n\n(Note: The Master had planted leeks within the walled garden to convey a hidden meaning.)\n\nDanyang also noticed a withered tree in the flower garden that had long since died. On the fourteenth day of the fourth month, he ordered it moved and replanted within the walled garden, then composed another poem:\n*Thirty-six above in the heavens,*\n*Thirty-six below on the earth.*\n*Heaven and earth enter the precious vase,*\n*And the seventy-two seasonal nodes are complete.*\n\nBy the twentieth day of the fifth month, green shoots sprouted, and the withered trunk revived. Danyang said to the Master: \"The fourteenth day of the fourth month is the birthday of Pure Yang’s descent into the world, and it is also my birthday. Thirty-six days separate them, and the union of heaven and earth’s day and night completes the seventy-two seasonal nodes.\" The Master recorded this marvel in *The Record of the Wondrous Tree* and inscribed it on a stele.\n\nBefore long, Danyang brought the Master to the ancestral court in Zhongnan, where he resided for several years, repeatedly receiving the Master’s approval. In the *renyin* year (1182), as Danyang prepared to return east, Changchun said to the Master: \"Our Dao now turns eastward.\" At that time, Liu Wujie of Guantao, a friend of the Master, had been appointed to an official post in E Prefecture. Upon completing his term, he invited the Master to travel east with him.",

Thereafter, the Dao flourished daily, and disciples gathered like clouds. Several years later, the Master manifested a minor illness and passed away in accordance with the natural course. His body was as light as a cicada’s sloughed husk, and those who witnessed it from near and far marveled greatly. His disciples prepared the rites and buried him beside the hermitage.

His family had long been a prominent clan in Long’an County of Longzhou. From childhood, the Master differed from other children in play, and as he grew, his nature was cautious and sincere, his demeanor quiet and reserved. Tall and imposing in stature, he possessed an open and unrestrained bearing. He studied Confucian scholarship and once passed the provincial examination at the top rank, earning the title *jieyuan* among the people of Long. Yet he did not pursue official rank, often harboring the aspiration to withdraw from the world. Beyond thirty, he remained unmarried.\n\nIn the autumn of the *wuxu* year of the Dading era (1178), Master Danyang propagated the Dao in Longchuan, and those who turned toward him gathered in great numbers. The Master, upon seeing him, was deeply moved, saying, “This is where I shall find my repose.” Thereupon, he prepared a vegetarian feast, lit incense, and requested to join the ranks of disciples; Danyang accepted him. The following year, when Danyang returned to the ancestral court, the Master followed and resided there. Morning and evening, he inquired and studied the teachings of the Dao, virtue, nature, and destiny, gaining profound insight.\n\nBy the *renyin* year (1182), when Danyang’s immortal retinue returned east, the Master traveled between Zhongnan and the Feng and Long mountains, wandering freely as before. During Zhang Bangzhi of Henei’s tenure as magistrate of Fufeng, he often invited the Master to his home to discourse on the Dao. The Master would stay for months, forming a bond of transcendent friendship. His writings favored simplicity, his poetry refined and vigorous, evoking the style of Tao Yuanming and Xie Lingyun. Daily, he recited the *Laozi*, *Zhuangzi*, and *Huangting Jing* as his regular practice, and no improper words ever passed his lips. When others spoke of others’ faults, he would close his eyes and refuse to engage, saying only, “Such talk only harms virtue and invites resentment. To be strict with oneself and lenient toward others—this is the sage’s teaching.” Thus, wherever he went, people revered and admired him.\n\nIn the final years of the Zhengda era, when warfare erupted in Feng and Long, the Master carried his belongings deep into the Long Mountains, and his fate thereafter remained unknown.",

      "translated_text": "When the Great Yuan brought governance and rectitude to the realm, the Perfected Master of Penetrating Truth, Yu Jun, was ordered by imperial decree to preside over the ancestral sanctuary of Mount Zhongnan. Seeking the Master’s lost writings, he obtained them from Zheng Lian, a Daoist adept of Youde Abbey in Longzhou, and titled them *The Collection of Contemplating the Mysterious*. In the early years of the Zhongtong era, Zhao Zhichong, a disciple of the Master at the Haotian Abbey in Jingzhao, established a propitious site north of the prefectural city. He invited Meng Panlin, a Hanlin Academician, to compose an inscription, and erected a tomb to inter the Master’s ceremonial robes, ensuring offerings in spring and autumn.\n\nMaster Su, surnamed Su, named Xuan, styled Yunzhongzi, was a native of Pucheng in Huazhou. By nature, he was generous and kind, modest and fond of propriety. When he encountered misty peaks and scenic vistas, he would forget to return all day. In the spring of the Xinmao year of the Dading era, he journeyed to the ancestral sanctuary of Mount Zhongnan to seek initiation under Master Danyang. He knelt before him, entreating enlightenment. Danyang kept him close, teaching him the rites and disciplines of entering the Dao. After years of devoted service, he never once slackened. Danyang transmitted to him the mysteries of the Dao and frequently composed poems and lyrics to guide him, urging him to cultivate true attainment. Eventually, his heart-source became luminous, and his Dao-body harmoniously merged. At that time, all his fellow Daoists regarded him as a \"Lesser Danyang,\" a testament to his profound mastery of the Dao.\n\nLater, he took leave of his teacher and traveled to the eastern seas, blending with the world while upholding the lineage and spreading the teachings. In the summer of the Renyin year, when Danyang returned east, the Master attended him once more, remaining by his side until Danyang’s ascension. He then lingered in the region of Deng and Lai. In the early Mingchang era, Master Changchun commanded him to propagate the teachings in Yan and Ji, residing at Chongfu Abbey. The Dao flourished daily, and his followers grew numerous. One day, he said to his disciples, “When will the world’s dusty affairs ever end? I shall return.” With these words, colorful clouds swirled in the sky. He reclined, resting his head on his arm, and passed away. In the winter of the Yisi year of the Zhida era, the Perfected Master of Purity and Harmony relocated his remains to the immortal burial grounds of Wuhua Mountain. By imperial decree, the Perfected Master of True Constancy posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of the Clouds, Rectifier of the Dao, and Auxiliary of Primordial Power*.\n\nMaster Yu, from Hedong in Dizhou, surnamed Yu, named Tongqing, styled Taining, and known by his Daoist name Zhen’guangzi, was born after his mother dreamed of a divine being who gave her a cinnabar pellet to swallow, resulting in her pregnancy. On the day of his birth, a crimson light filled the room, lingering for half a day before dissipating. Having lost his father in early childhood, his home was near the Divine Empyrean Palace. In his youth, his mother took him to burn incense at the palace hearth. Pointing to the sacred image, he asked, “Can one become such a divine being?” His mother replied, “Only those who dedicate themselves to the Dao may draw near.” The Master silently assented, and from then on, he often visited the palace to play. Whenever he saw a Daoist master reciting scriptures, he would sit quietly beside him, listening intently until the recitation ended before departing.\n\nAs he grew older, he conducted himself with uprightness and paid no heed to family property. He harbored a constant aspiration to transcend worldly concerns, though he knew not where to turn. In his twentieth year, his mother passed away. He buried and mourned her with full rites. In the Jihai year of the Dading era, a Daoist suddenly arrived at his door begging for food. The Master fed him and asked where he was headed. The Daoist replied that he was traveling to Mount Zhongnan to visit a teacher. The Master then accompanied him and paid homage to Master Danyang at the ancestral sanctuary. Danyang inquired about his intentions, and the Master truthfully recounted his circumstances. Danyang kept him at his side, where he performed menial tasks for years. One day, Danyang wrote out a code of conduct and handed it to him, saying, “Follow this, and the ranks of immortality may be attained.” He also repeatedly transmitted true instructions, enabling the Master to achieve perfect clarity of heart and nature.\n\nWhen Danyang later returned east, he left the Master to reside at the ancestral sanctuary. In the Xinhai year of the Mingchang era, when Changchun also returned from the eastern seas, the Master followed him to Taixu Abbey in Qixia. After several more years, Changchun approached him and said, “The teachings of the sages and worthies are about to flourish. You may go to Beijing and other places to propagate our Dao.” He then entrusted him with a personal letter and conferred upon him the authority of the teachings. The Master accepted the command and resided in the capital’s outskirts for three years. His divine radiance was often witnessed, and officials and commoners alike entreated him to emerge. Countless seekers came to inquire about the mysteries of the Dao, all departing enriched. Thereafter, the Dao flourished daily, and he initiated over a thousand disciples, though only Lu Rouhe and Ding Zhiyi were deemed his closest followers.\n\nHe selected an auspicious site in the northeastern outskirts of the capital and built Huayang Abbey to serve as his residence, also styling himself the *Recluse of Tuyang*. In the Jisi year of the Da’an era, the Perfected Master Yuyang arrived from the north with his immortal retinue and lodged at the abbey. Shortly after, he took the Master to the capital of Yan, where he was bestowed with the purple robe and the title of Master. From then on, his reputation soared, and his disciples multiplied. In the Jiaxu year of the Zhenyou era, he received a summons from Changchun and returned to Taixu Abbey in Qixia to oversee its affairs. When the Xingding era began, bandits stirred unrest, and he relocated to Xiushan Hermitage in Xingshan Village, Fushan County.\n\nOne day, the Master gathered his followers and announced, “Today, the weather is clear, and the northern troops are at rest. I shall return.” He then bathed, wrote a verse, and said:\n*“This morning, I topple the rootless tree,\nIn an instant, I overturn the alchemical furnace.\nUnobstructed, I depart alone,\nLeaning on my staff, I journey to Penglai.”*\nHe cast aside his brush, closed his eyes, and passed away at the age of fifty-six. At that moment, five-colored clouds enveloped the hermitage, lingering all day without dispersing. After the war, Li Zhifang, a dharma-grandson of the abbot of Tianqing Abbey in Zhangde Prefecture, relocated the Master’s remains and interred them in the immortal burial grounds of Wangyu Village northwest of the prefectural city, where a hall was built to enshrine his incense and spirit.\n\nMaster Zhao, surnamed Zhao, named Wuxuan, styled Zishen, and known by his Daoist name Liaozhenzi, was a native of Lintong in Jingzhao. His family had long been farmers. He remained in his mother’s womb for twelve months and was born on the second day of the fifth month of the first year of the Tiande era. At the moment of his birth, a divine radiance filled the room, astonishing all who witnessed it. His relatives marveled at the omen.",

When others spoke of others’ faults, he would close his eyes and refuse to engage, saying only, “Such talk only harms virtue and invites resentment. To be strict with oneself and lenient toward others—this is the sage’s teaching.” Thus, wherever he went, people revered and admired him.\n\nIn the final years of the Zhengda era, when warfare erupted in Feng and Long, the Master carried his belongings deep into the Long Mountains, and his fate thereafter remained unknown.",

      "translated_text": "As he grew older, his aspirations turned to purity and emptiness, finding no delight in worldly pleasures. In the spring of the *gengyin* year of the Dading era, Master Danyang of the Quanzhen lineage, accompanied by his three companions Qiu, Liu, and Tan, entered the Pass and passed through Lingkou Town. The Master, recognizing their extraordinary nature, invited them to his home and prepared a vegetarian feast in their honor. Thereupon, together with his mother, Madame Wei, his elder sister, younger brother, wife, and nephew—six in all—they journeyed to the ancestral hermitage on Mount Zhongnan and sought ordination under Master Danyang. At the time, Danyang was urgently engaged in saving sentient beings and establishing teachings, and all six were granted admission. Each was entrusted with the subtle principles of cultivating the True, and in subsequent years, Danyang frequently guided them with Dharma teachings. All became accomplished figures in the Daoist tradition, though the Master served Danyang the longest. After receiving the transmission, he resided for several years at the hermitage of Liu and Jiang.\n\nIn the *gengzi* year, Zhao En of Jingzhao donated his residence to establish Penglai Hermitage, inviting the Master to reside there. He accepted without hesitation and remained in silent meditation for over a decade. Later, a Daoist friend from Qin Village in Chunhua County of Hezhou, surnamed Li, built a hermitage and invited the Master to dwell there. He stayed for twelve years, attaining the perfect accord of mind and Dao. He broke off four cypress branches and planted them in the hermitage, praying for their flourishing.\n\nDuring the Taihe era, Zhui Xiyi of Fanchuan in Xianning County, having heard of the Master’s attainment, built a hermitage and invited him to reside there. One day, the Master’s disciple Zhui Du was patrolling the tea houses of Jingzhao when he encountered a Daoist begging for alms. He gave the man a single coin and departed. Over a month later, Zhui Du returned home and paid his respects to the Master in his humble abode. Seeing him, the Master exclaimed in surprise, “This is the Daoist who begged for alms in the tea house!” Zhui Du asked, “Has the Master ever gone out?” The Master replied, “No.” Thereupon, Zhui Du burned incense, bowed in reverence, and offered his ancestral cypress grove in Zhuyang Village—known as Bopo—as a site for the Master to build Quandao Hermitage, a perpetual sanctuary for cultivating the True.\n\nThe Master once told his disciple Ran Yiqi, “The Great White Temple in Jingzhao is where the Primordial Daoist Ancestor, Lord Lao, manifested his teachings. Previously, Danyang built a hall beside it, and in the future, it will surely become a grand Daoist sanctuary. You should reside there.” The Master himself frequently came and went from the temple, and today it has indeed become a renowned abbey.

His lifetime compositions of Daoist poetry and lyrics, titled *The Ladder to Immortality*, circulated in the world. He ordained several hundred disciples, with only Wang Deyu and Ran Yiqi entering his inner chamber. Later, he was reburied at Bopo in Quandao Hermitage in Fanchuan, where Assistant Magistrate Yang Tingxiu of Pingdong was invited to compose a stele inscription to record his Daoist conduct. After the Tianxing military campaign, the site of Quandao Hermitage was extensively renovated into Cuiwei Abbey.\n\nIn the renzi year, the Perfected of True Constancy offered incense at the ancestral court and posthumously bestowed upon him the title \"Perfected of Vast Mystery.\"\n\n**Master Duan Mingyuan**\nMaster Duan, a native of Pingshui, held the Dharma name Guangpu, the courtesy name Mingyuan, and the Daoist name Zhenyangzi. As a child, he was quick-witted; in adulthood, he was bold and chivalrous. After injuring someone while drunk, he fled to Guanzhong to evade punishment. By chance, he arrived at the ancestral court on Mount Zhongnan, where he heard Master Danyang expounding the Dao and experienced profound awakening. Thereupon, he burned incense, bowed in reverence, and earnestly begged to leave the household life. Danyang assented, and he humbly performed menial tasks in service to his master. Over the years, he gradually attained realization in his heart. One day, kneeling before his teacher, Danyang instructed him to \"diminish desires, settle the mind, subdue the strong, and blunt the sharp.\" Having received the master’s affirmation, he practiced the teachings he had received. Within a few years, he attained clarity of mind and ascended to the wondrous Dao. He then took up his staff and returned to Hedong, where he built Liaozhen Hermitage north of Jishan County’s city walls. From then on, many sought refuge under him.\n\nIn the summer of the renyin year, he suddenly told his disciples, “Master Danyang will soon arrive. Prepare offerings of incense, and follow me to pay our respects.” He immediately set out with his assembly, and upon reaching Tong Pass, the immortal’s procession indeed arrived. Danyang inquired about his cultivation, and the Master responded with his progress. Danyang sighed, saying, “Guanzhong already has Zhao Wuxuan, and Hedong now has Duan Mingyuan—our teaching has found its transmission.” The Master bowed in farewell and returned, his reputation in the Dao ever higher.\n\nYang Mingzhen of Sanyuan, hearing of him, traveled to pay his respects and seek instruction. He received much guidance and was later presented with a poem titled *Words of One Beyond the World*. In the second month of the second year of the Mingchang era, on the twenty-eighth day, the Master summoned his disciples and said, “I shall journey to the Three Mountains.” He bathed, wrote a verse, and recited:\n\n*For years I delighted in quietude,*\n*Brightness of nature shone like a candle’s glow.*\n*Spirit roams the paths of the Three Isles,*\n*Qi weaves the six-zhu robe.*\n*Unfettered, unbound,*\n*Carefree, beyond right and wrong.*\n*Silent, with nothing to do—*\n*The crane-borne carriage returns on colored clouds.*\n\nHaving written this, he reclined on his arm and passed away.

      "translated_text": "After three years of tending to meals and humble service, Shouyi’s diligence only deepened, never slackening for even a moment. Moved by his devotion, Danyang imparted to him the true oral instructions, teaching him to endure humiliation, subdue the heart, and refine his spirit and qi. Over time, his mind grew empty and luminous, and he gradually gained insight.\n\nOne day, he knelt before his master and said: “Though base and foolish, I have been awakened by your guidance. Yet I have nothing to repay you—would you, in your compassion, not disdain my clumsiness and allow me to continue drawing water and tending the hearth for three more years?” Danyang refused, saying: “Before, when you had not yet awakened, you were right to serve with diligence. Now that you have gained some attainment, you must advance in true practice and guide those who come after.”\n\nThereupon, Shouyi took his leave and wandered north of the Yellow River, begging for alms as his Way flourished day by day. In the winter of the *guimao* year of the Dading era (1183), when he learned that Danyang had returned to the True, he built a hut by his master’s grave and kept vigil for three years. Soon after, he suddenly summoned his disciples and said: “Last night, my master’s true spirit gave me a command—to follow him to the Daoist mountain.” He bathed, changed his robes, and peacefully passed away on the fourteenth day of the fourth month in the first year of the Mingchang era (1190). After the war, his disciples reburied him at Chongyang Abbey in Baijian Village, Penglai County, Dengzhou, where they erected a hall and enshrined his image.\n\n---\n\nYang Mingzhen, whose family name was Yang, was a native of Sanyuan County in Yaozhou. His father was Fan, and his mother was of the Liu clan. He was born on the eighteenth day of the eleventh month in the *gengwu* year of the Tiande era (1150). At the moment of his birth, a blue-green qi filled the room. As a child, he was stern and aloof, refusing to play with other children. As he grew, he often sighed at the fleeting nature of mortal life and yearned for the Way of immortality.\n\nIn the fourteenth year of the Dading era (1174), hearing that Master Danyang was propagating the great teachings of Quanzhen at the ancestral sanctuary on Mount Zhongnan, he abandoned his home and journeyed to his door, begging for instruction. Seeing his tall, robust frame and open, magnanimous bearing, Danyang exclaimed: “This is truly the stuff of immortals!” He gave him the religious name Mingzhen and the style Bixuzi, then taught him the oral instructions for the returning elixir and the flowing stream.\n\nAfter receiving these transmissions, Mingzhen let his hair grow wild and his face become grimy, begging for food to sustain himself. Sometimes he sang, sometimes he danced, feigning madness to mock the world—people called him “Yang the Madman.” He always carried a ladle as his drinking vessel, mingling with beggars at the city gates, remaining silent for years. His resolve was harder than metal or stone as he wandered between Mount Zhongnan and the Hu region.\n\nLater, learning that Danyang had ascended to immortality, he traveled east to the sea to make offerings at his master’s grave. He also visited Masters Changsheng and Yuyang, receiving much guidance from them. On his meandering journey west, he heard that Du Zhenyang, styled Zhenyangzi, of Jishan County had been approved by Danyang. Taking the route through Hebei, he burned incense and paid his respects. Du secretly imparted the essentials of the Dao and presented him with *Words of One Beyond the World*.\n\nMingzhen then returned to Qin. From that time on, all doubts and obstacles vanished. He entered the Xuan Zhao Hall before the capital’s provincial office, sat in silent absorption, and though the world’s splendor unfolded before him, he never once glanced at it. His heart turned to ashes, his body withered—after a dozen years in the mountains, he entered the great mystery.\n\nIn the *jiwei* year of the Cheng’an era (1200), Gao Deqing, the Transport Commissioner, suddenly suffered from heart pain, and no physician could cure him. As he lay on the verge of death, he dreamed that Mingzhen sprayed water into his mouth. His body broke into a sweat, and he suddenly revived. Within days, his limbs were restored to health. He personally visited the Xuan Zhao Hall, burned incense, and bowed in gratitude, offering gold and silk. Mingzhen refused them and instead composed ten quatrains to express his thanks.\n\nOn the Double Fifth Festival, Mingzhen was at Qingzhen Hermitage. He drew a furnace on the ground, gathered soil to use as incense, and a jade-green smoke rose in coils over a *zhang* high, forming a canopy that lingered for some time. Several cranes circled and cried above it as ten thousand eyes looked up in awe.\n\nThereafter, General Wanyan provided funds to build the present-day Danxia Abbey.

      "translated_text": "Thereafter, villagers afflicted with illness flocked to seek his water. Finding their demands burdensome, Mingzhen spat a cup of water into a well, which resounded like thunder. From then on, the sick who drew and drank from it were all cured. To this day, it is called the Dharma Water Well.\n\nBefore long, he returned to his ancestral temple to live in seclusion, summoning his disciples to hold a vegetarian feast and gather the assembly. He transmitted the Dharma to Master Wuyu Zi Li and requested that Observer Bi Zhichang be entrusted with his place of retreat. He left behind a gatha:\n\nEighty years passed swift as lightning’s flash,\nA heap of stinking rot cast in a barren field.\nNow that I depart, no hindrance remains—\nCast off the hand, return to emptiness, and merge with the natural.\n\nSetting down his brush, he peacefully transformed. Song Zhaoran of Fushan, who had long been at odds with Mingzhen, was bidding him farewell outside the window when Song rushed out to greet him—just as word arrived that Mingzhen had ascended. This occurred on the eleventh day of the sixth lunar month in the *wuzǐ* year of the Zhengda era, at the age of seventy-nine. He left behind several hundred disciples, and his lifetime writings, titled *The Chang’an Collection*, circulated in the world. He was buried in the Immortal Shedding Garden of Liu and Jiang.\n\nIn the winter of the *gēngxū* year, the Preceptor Zhenchang, the Perfected of True Constancy, by imperial decree posthumously bestowed upon him the title Perfected of Azure Emptiness, Unyielding and Stalwart.\n\n**Master Zhou Quandao**\nMaster Zhou’s personal name was Quandao. His family had long been prominent in ancient Bin. He was born on the twenty-second day of the twelfth lunar month in the *yǐchǒu* year of the Huangtong era. From childhood, his speech and silence, his movements and stillness, were as those of a grown man. His appearance was strangely archaic, his demeanor refined and serene. Having lost his father early, his family’s livelihood was meager, yet he exerted himself to serve his mother. When she suddenly fell gravely ill, no treatment availed, so he cut flesh from his thigh, mixing it with medicine to offer her. Her illness then abated, and his filial piety became known throughout the village.\n\nWhen he came of age, a villager sought to betroth his daughter to him, but he gently declined. When his mother passed away, his grief was so profound it nearly extinguished his nature. He sighed, saying: “I have heard the Daoists say that if one child attains the Dao, nine generations of ancestors ascend as immortals. To repay her boundless kindness, nothing compares to this.”\n\nIn the *guǐsì* year of the Dading era, Master Danyang of the Quanzhen lineage resided at the ancestral temple on Mount Zhongnan, expounding the teachings of the Quanzhen school. Mingzhen then presented himself before him, seeking to receive the essentials of the Dao. Danyang accepted him, placing him among his disciples, and had him personally tend to tasks such as gathering firewood and hulling grain. Mingzhen served with reverence and diligence, never slackening for years. Observing his resolve to receive the Dao, Danyang one day summoned him into his chamber, transmitting to him the *Zhen’gao* and bestowing upon him the name Master Quanyang.\n\nHaving received the Dharma, Mingzhen disciplined himself and refined his mind, practicing what he had been taught. After several more years, the entire assembly marveled at the sincerity of his conduct. Soon after, Danyang said to him: “Bin lies near the frontier, where the transformative power of the teachings is difficult to spread. You should go and reside there to propagate our Dao.” Mingzhen accepted the instruction and went to establish a hermitage at the foot of Yufeng Mountain, where he nurtured his spirit and cultivated vastness. In teaching and transforming others, he adapted to each according to their roots, and all—whether of shallow or deep nature—received enlightenment. As for those afflicted with chronic illness, disability, or orphaned, widowed, and without recourse, he gathered and cared for them in the hermitage. Thus, the gentry and common folk of the village grew ever more respectful, and the people of Bin turned toward goodness.\n\nIn the *rényín* year, Danyang passed away. Thereafter, Mingzhen unfailingly journeyed to the ancestral temple each Clear and Bright Festival to offer sacrifices, making it an annual observance. During the Zhenyou era, when the Qiang people overran Bin, Mingzhen was among the captives. Though held in bondage, his devotion to the Dao never wavered. The Qiang, recognizing him as an extraordinary man, released him. Disciples came from all directions to receive his teachings, their numbers beyond counting. He instructed each to establish their own place of practice and guided those who came after.",

      "translated_text": "In the final years of the Yuanguang era, Minister Zhang Xinpu, Left Assistant Director of the Secretariat, was appointed to govern Bin Prefecture. Having long been wary of Master Zhou’s reputation, he came directly to Jade Peak to inquire into his cultivation. The Master expounded to him the principles of the Dao, life, nature, and destiny. Delighted by his sincerity, the minister declared upon leaving, “Zhou Quanyang is a man of the Dao.” The next day, he hosted a vegetarian feast, presented the Master with a robe and shoes, and thereafter frequently sent attendants to inquire after his well-being. The Master, in turn, often traveled to and fro, residing at the Temple of Emperor Gaozu of Han in Chang’an, where General Wanyan treated him with the reverence due a teacher.\n\nIn the *wùzǐ* year of the Zhengda era, he returned once more to Bin. On the seventeenth day of the tenth month, he unexpectedly instructed his disciples to prepare a feast. Summoning his dharma heir, Yuanmingzi Li Zhiyuan, he entrusted him, saying: “Nanshi Village in the Zhongnan Mountains was the place where the Patriarch first spread the teachings and refined the truth. I wish to restore and expand it to honor the immortal legacy, but the times are such that it cannot be forced. When peace returns in days to come, you and your fellow disciples must strive to fulfill this aspiration.” With these words, he ordered his attendant to light incense and directed the assembly to recite the *Qingjing Jing*. Seated upright in solemn attention, he listened as the sutra was chanted three times, then leaned his head upon his left arm and passed away at the age of eighty-four. He was buried beside Jade Peak Hermitage.\n\nA scholar named Wang Caiqing, who shared a deep bond with the Master, was then serving in Qingyang. As the imperial troops besieged the city with great urgency, Wang suddenly dreamed of the Master arriving in ethereal grace, saying: “I have come especially to bid you farewell. This floating life is but a fleeting lodging—cling not to it overlong. Once this body is lost, to regain it would be most difficult.” With these words, he departed. Soon after, the siege was lifted, and Wang inquired among others, only to learn that the day of the Master’s appearance in his dream was the very day he had returned to the truth. Thereupon, Wang resigned his office, renounced his wife and children, and devoted himself to the Dao for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn the *wùwǔ* year of the Cheng’an era, a man from Zoucheng County in Donglu named Zhang Zhiyuan, styled Dongxuzi, twice dreamed of divine beings brandishing white blades, rebuking him: “Your years are nearly spent—why do you not seek a master and study the Dao to avoid an untimely death?” Awakening in a daze, he wandered to the western outskirts of the city, where he suddenly encountered a Daoist in hempen robes and straw sandals, his frame tall and imposing, approaching from the west. The Daoist addressed Zhang, saying: “You possess deep karmic affinity, and so I have come to receive you.” There by the roadside, he imparted the secret instructions of inner cultivation and presented him with a hempen sash, adding: “Hold this in reverence and never forget my teachings. Thirty years hence, a disciple of my lineage will come here to meet you, and at that time, you shall form a profound karmic bond with the true master.” When Zhang asked his name, he replied: “I am Zhou Quanyang of Guanzhong.” Then he vanished. Zhang thereupon changed his attire and entered the Daoist path. Later, in Jizhou, he established the Baiyun Abbey, ordaining hundreds of disciples and founding hermitages and temples throughout the Qi and Lu regions.\n\nIn the *rénchén* year, when the Six Armies advanced into Henan, Li Yuanming led his followers north across the river and settled in Qi’e County, where they built the Qizhen Abbey. Hearing of this, Zhang traveled to pay his respects and recounted the circumstances of his earlier encounter with the Master. Yuanming produced a portrait of the Master, and Zhang, burning incense and bowing deeply, exclaimed: “This is indeed the master I met before!” He acknowledged Yuanming as his elder in the Dao.\n\nIn the *yǐwèi* year, when Guanzhong was pacified, Yuanming, mindful of the Master’s final instructions, led a hundred disciples of the lineage back west and established a grand Daoist temple in Nanshi. Zhang Dongxu and others contributed gold and silk to support the endeavor. Within a decade, the magnificent structure stood complete, its grandeur and openness a sight to behold.\n\nIn the *xīnchǒu* spring, the Qinghe Perfected One commanded his disciples to inter the Master’s remains in the Immortals’ Burial Ground at Liujiang. In the *rénzǐ* year, the Perfected Master of the True Constant, Li, by imperial decree posthumously bestowed upon him the title “Quanyang, Perfected One of Vast Virtue and Vast Transformation.”\n\n---\n\nMaster Qiao Qiandao was a native of Pingyang, of the Qiao clan, named Qiandao and styled Chongxuzi. By nature serene and contemplative, he had long been drawn to the mysteries of the Dao. In the *rényín* year of the Dading era, at the age of thirty-six, he journeyed to Zhongnan with his fellow villager Li Chongdao to pay homage to Master Danyang, seeking to receive the teachings of the Quanzhen school. They resided at the ancestral temple in Liujiang, gathering firewood and drawing water to serve the Daoist community. Though they endured hardships without respite, they never faltered in their devotion.\n\nOne day, Danyang imparted to him the profound instructions and presented him with two quatrains:\n\n*Content with fate, untroubled by poverty,*\n*He bears the jade within, his heart and mind unlike the crowd.*\n*Refining the elixir depends on the craftsman’s hand—*\n*Let the cauldron’s frost and snow turn crimson red.*\n\n*The Dao’s mysteries—with whom to fathom them?*\n*Only when meeting a kindred spirit do words align.*\n*Guard the black, lest the heart grow dark,*\n*For the cinnabar’s glow outshines the face’s bloom.*\n\nHaving received these teachings, Master Qiao and his fellow disciple Li devoted themselves to rigorous cultivation, their diligence in the Dao spanning over a decade, enabling them to penetrate its deepest mysteries. In the *rényín* year, when Danyang passed away, the two masters traveled together, harmonizing their voices and waters, begging for alms to sustain themselves. Later, the Minister of Revenue, Liu Haojian, remarked to others: “In ancient times, Liezi dwelled in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet none knew him as a man of the Dao. Those who embrace the Dao and hold fast to virtue are like merchants who conceal their finest wares, fearing discovery. I observe that Masters Qiao and Li are of this same lineage.” The villagers, upon hearing this, grew ever more respectful. They selected a site in the northeastern corner of the old city and built the Taiqing Abbey to honor them.\n\nIn the *bǐngwǔ* year, when Master Changchun propagated the teachings at the ancestral temple, the two masters came to sit among his disciples, daily receiving his instructions. Changchun, perceiving their steadfastness, suddenly declared to the assembly: “Masters Qiao and Li are diligent in the Dao—truly the most accomplished in my lineage.” From that time, their reputation in the Dao grew ever higher.\n\nIn the *xīnhài* year of the Mingchang era, at Changchun’s behest, they jointly spread the teachings in Hedong, establishing the Chongxu Abbey in Linfen. In the *réntù* year of the Taihe era, they returned to Heshui, residing at the Qizhen Abbey to receive and guide others. In the *dīngchǒu* spring of the Zhenyou era, during the third month, as he sat conversing with the scholar Wang Keda, he suddenly said: “I would trouble you with a small request—would you provide a robe to see me on my way?”",

      "translated_text": "Within days, he passed away without illness at the age of eighty-one. Only then did Wang Keda, arriving to offer condolences, realize that the robe he had requested was meant for his coffin.\n\nAt the time, his disciple Li Daoyin was residing elsewhere. One day, a certain master suddenly appeared at his door, offering private instruction. As he took his leave, he added: “Come again tomorrow—I have something further to entrust to you.” The next day, as Daoyin was en route, he encountered someone who reported that the master had already ascended in transcendence the day before. Only then did he understand that the visitor had been a manifestation beyond the physical form.\n\n**Li Chongdao**\nMaster Li, styled Chongdao, was also known by the sobriquet Qingxuzi. His family hailed from Pingyang. Of resolute character and skilled in literary composition, he served his parents with filial devotion. In the *rénchén* year of the Dading era, as he approached forty, he formed a bond of profound friendship with Qiao Qiandao of the same village. Together, they journeyed to the Zhongnan Mountains in Shaanxi to seek the teachings of Master Danyang of the Quanzhen lineage. Seeing their potential, the master kept them among his disciples, where they labored for years—pounding grain, sweeping floors—growing ever more reverent with time. One day, he imparted secret instructions and presented them with a poem:\n\n*Beyond the world’s cares, boundless delight,*\n*Yet blending with the dust, harmonizing light.*\n*Alas, floating clouds—empty, fleeting dreams,*\n*Like withered leaves dancing in autumn’s gleam.*\n\n*Let others mock the Daoist’s humble state,*\n*Unshaken in resolve, apart from common fate.*\n*In the cavern’s depths, frost and snow descend,*\n*Yet the seed of wisdom blooms anew, its hues transcend.*\n\nHaving received the master’s affirmation, Chongdao devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Dao, sitting in meditation without reclining for nearly a decade, until his mind became as vast as the heavens. In the Taiding era, he suddenly beheld a divine radiance illuminating his chamber, bright as daylight. With Qiao, he then traveled to Heyang, where they begged for alms, cultivated their conduct, and propagated the true teachings.\n\nIn the *bǐngwǔ* year, when Changchun returned from Mount Long to the ancestral sanctuary, Chongdao again attended his seat, advancing in the supreme Dao. By the *xīnhài* year of the Mingchang era, as Changchun prepared to journey east, he commanded Chongdao and Qiao to spread the teachings in Hedong. They established the Chongxu Abbey west of Linfen County, ordaining hundreds of disciples and founding dozens of hermitages and abbeys. Through songs and verses, Chongdao subtly revealed the profound principles of the Dao. Qiao admonished him: “A Daoist should conceal his light and remain obscure. Now that a true master of the highest order is still in the world, we must each advance in the authentic Dao.” Chongdao acknowledged his words and burned his writings.\n\nOne day, he ordered his disciples to prepare a bath and said: “My worldly ties are now severed. Today, I shall return.” He entrusted them with final instructions on the pursuit of the Dao, then peacefully departed. Neither smoke nor mist, yet a fragrant haze enveloped the courtyard for three days. All who witnessed it—scholars and commoners alike—marveled. He was interred at Chongxu Abbey, where a hall and statue were erected to honor his memory.\n\n**Zhao Jiugu**\nMaster Zhao, whose given name was Jiugu and Daoist name Xujingzi, was born into a family of officials in Tanzhou. His ancestors had served in succession, earning distinction in governance. His father, a prefect of Zizhou, was later transferred to serve as vice-prefect of Pingdong, where the family settled.\n\nJiugu was born in the third year of the Dading era, the *guǐwèi* year. Of serene and refined disposition, a fortune-teller once remarked: “His bearing is pure, his bones extraordinary—he cannot be confined to the dust of the world.” Having lost his father early, he harbored aspirations of transcending the mundane. In the seventeenth year of his life, the *dīngyǒu* year, his mother wished to arrange his marriage, but he refused. Repeatedly, he sought to enter the Daoist path. Though his mother reproached him, she recognized the steadfastness of his resolve and eventually consented.\n\nHearing of a certain Cui Yangtou in the prefecture who was accomplished in the Dao, he went to study under him. Cui assigned him to kitchen duties, often demanding that he prepare five to seven meals each night, only to change the required flavors each time. Yet Cui neither ate much nor allowed excess preparation, forcing Jiugu to remain awake through the night. For three years, his reverence deepened, and not a trace of arrogance remained. Others referred to him as “the inner attendant.” Cui, recognizing his worth, in the nineteenth year, the *jǐhài* year, sent him to study under Danyang in Huating. Danyang accepted him.\n\nIn the *gēngzǐ* year, Danyang returned to Zhongnan and instructed Jiugu to serve Changchun at Longmen, personally guiding his training. Changchun, who had taken the name Daojian, frequently traveled to Pingdong. In the *bǐngwǔ* year, Changchun brought him to the ancestral sanctuary in Zhongnan. (Changchun had received the imperial summons in the *wùshēn* year.) There, he left Jiugu to serve Master Lingyang Li.\n\nIn the *xīnhài* year of the Mingchang era, as Changchun journeyed east to the sea, he passed through Yecheng and commanded Jiugu to pay respects to Changsheng. Shortly after, Changsheng sent Jiugu to reside at Qixia Abbey. Changchun, pleased by his arrival, appointed him as his literary attendant, entrusting him with the management of scriptures and teachings. Whenever officials, scholars, or Daoist followers came to pay their respects, they were required to first meet with Jiugu before entering the master’s chamber.\n\nHis writings were elegant and archaic, his calligraphy reminiscent of the *Huaihe Ming*. In the *jǐmǎo* year, as Changchun received the imperial summons to journey to the Western Regions, Jiugu was chosen as the foremost among his attendants. Upon reaching Sailan City, he said to Minister Qinghe Yin: “When I reach Xuande, I sense the signs of my departure. As the master once instructed, a Daoist should not be troubled by life or death—what is there to fear? You must all serve the true master well.” With these words, he passed away at the age of fifty-nine. He was buried on the eastern plain outside the city, and to this day, the locals venerate his memory.\n\nInitially, when Changchun passed through Mount Abuhan, he left Song Dao’an and eight others to establish Qixia Abbey and await his return. In the *rénwǔ* year, a malicious man named Tuoji incited a lawsuit, causing great distress among the disciples. One day, as Dao’an napped, he saw Jiugu descend through the skylight and say: “A letter from my master has arrived.” Dao’an asked: “From where?” Jiugu replied: “From the heavens.” Upon receiving it, he saw only the two characters *Taiqing*. When Dao’an shared this with the others, a letter indeed arrived the next day from the imperial court, and the lawsuit was resolved. This was Jiugu’s unseen protection.\n\nIn the *guǐwèi* year, as Changchun returned east and passed Jiugu’s grave, his companions wished to exhume and transport his remains. Changchun stopped them, saying: “The four elements are but a borrowed form, destined to be discarded. Only the true nature of the spirit remains unbound and free.”",

In the *dīngchǒu* spring of the Zhenyou era, during the third month, as he sat conversing with the scholar Wang Keda, he suddenly said: “I would trouble you with a small request—would you provide a robe to see me on my way?”",

      "translated_text": "Why cling so stubbornly to thoughts of that discarded form? The next day, they pressed onward, and upon reaching the lands of Han, in over ten places—from Yunzhong’s Wuchuan to Jinyang, Yan, and Ji—Changchun beheld the master arriving alone on horseback, foretelling the return of the Patriarch Changchun from the east and asking why none had come to greet him from afar. Such marvels of his spirit were too numerous to record in full; here, only one or two are noted to show that though he died, he did not perish.\n\nIn the *gēngxū* year, the Perfected Zhenchang, by imperial command, bestowed honors upon the Daoist masters for their virtue. The master was posthumously granted the title *Zhongzhen Xujiao Xuanying Perfected*, and his cap and shoes were interred on Wuhua Mountain to be venerated in annual rites.\n\nMaster Taoyanming was a native of Xiangling County in Pingyang. From childhood, he loved the Dao and was known for his filial devotion to his parents. After the age of thirty, he lost both his parents. Grieving deeply, he observed mourning beyond the prescribed rites. With resolve, he set aside his family burdens and crossed the river southward to reside in Lingbao County, seeking a master to study the Dao but unsure where to turn. In the *guǐsì* year of the Dading era, Xu Zijing of Hejian arrived as the county magistrate. Seeing the master’s pure and upright character, he said: “If you truly aspire to follow the Dao and cultivate immortality, you must find a teacher—otherwise, you will waste your years in vain. I have heard that Master Ma Danyang of the Quanzhen tradition now resides on Mount Zhongnan. You should seek him out.” He even composed a poem to send him on his way. The master then traveled directly to Liujiang, where Danyang, upon meeting him, seemed to share a bond from a past life. He kept him by his side, bestowing the name *Yanming* and the courtesy name *Mingfu*. After many days of close instruction, Danyang taught him the principles of *xing* and *ming*. Through constant guidance, morning and night, the master’s mind became clear and unobstructed. Danyang then sent him to travel and visit various places to investigate the state before his parents’ birth.\n\nThe master settled in Weinan, living on simple fare. He practiced what he had received from his teacher as if it were his lifelong path. Before many years had passed, Danyang summoned him back to the ancestral court and questioned him on his daily practice. Sighing, he said: “Pure and unadulterated—surely it is only Taoyanming.” He then granted him the title *Wumingzi* (“Nameless One”). Soon after, Danyang prepared to return east, and the master also left the pass, dwelling first on Baodu Mountain west of Luoyang before moving to reside in seclusion on Taohua Mountain. Over twenty years later, he suddenly told his disciples: “Yesterday, in meditation, I recalled that in a past life I once lived in Lingguang Cave, but now I cannot find its location.” Later, while traveling to Mount Nüji, he saw a stone wall inscribed with the three characters *Lingguang Cave*. Inside, the stone forest and iron mortar were still there, so he restored the cave and made it his home. His disciples verified his words and held him in even greater reverence. After more than ten years in seclusion, he abruptly moved to Changyuan, his intentions known to none.",

      "translated_text": "Within days, northern troops ravaged Mount Nüji, and many civilians suffered calamity—yet not a single horseman came to Changyuan. The people marveled all the more at the master’s foresight. Though his years were advanced, his steps remained firm, his spirit bright and clear, a testament to his lifelong cultivation. In the autumn of the *bingxu* year of the Zhengda era, disciples Di Baoyuan and Wang Baozhen of Yunxi Hermitage invited the master to spend the winter there. He declined, saying, “I have already made arrangements for the winter here. Come spring, I shall go to you and make it my place of retirement.” On the sixth day of the third month in the *dinghai* year, he arrived at Yunxi Hermitage with staff in hand, laughing and conversing with the Daoist assembly all day. The next morning, he changed into fresh robes, sat upright, and asked for paper and brush to write a hymn. Then, in an instant, he passed away at the age of eighty-six. His coffin remained in state for seven days; his cheeks retained their color, his crown remained warm, as though he were in deep slumber. He was interred in the quiet chamber where he had lived, and the following year, Master Lifeng Yu buried him west of Fengyi Mountain. When the coffin was opened, his form remained unchanged, and a fragrant breeze filled the valley. Tens of thousands came to pay their respects, all marveling in wonder. Thus, Left Minister Yao Shu composed an epitaph to record these marvels.\n\nMaster Wang Zhida, a native of Yan’an from the great clan of Wang, bore the name Zhida and the Daoist title Xuantongzi. He was born on the twenty-ninth day of the tenth month in the *gengwu* year of the Tiande era. Orphaned of his father in childhood, he possessed a refined discernment from a young age and often lamented the illusory nature of worldly affairs, harboring a heart that longed to transcend the mundane. In adulthood, due to his prosperous household, he served as village headman, collecting taxes with fairness and integrity, earning the respect of his community. In the *dingyou* year of the Dading era, a friend fell ill and, after several days, his body transformed into a great serpent—only his head and face remained unchanged. The master examined him, and the friend said, “Prepare a basket and take me to the mountains, lest my head and face also transform and harm the living.” The master lifted the cover for a closer look; from the neck down, his friend had indeed become a python. He and the family carried him to the foot of the mountain, where he slithered into the grass and vanished. The master was deeply shaken and left home, never to return. On the road, he encountered a stranger who imparted to him the mysteries of the Dao, saying, “Now, Master Danyang is teaching and transforming on Zhongnan Mountain. You should go and study under him.” The stranger then disappeared. The master went directly to Zhongnan and sought initiation. At first, Danyang refused him, even subjecting him to days of scolding and humiliation, but his resolve only grew stronger. Moved by his sincerity, Danyang allowed him to stay and serve among the disciples, teaching him to endure humiliation and refine his heart. After several years, his diligence, frugality, humility, and devotion deepened with time. Before long, Danyang entrusted him with the essentials of virtue, nature, and life. Having received the transmission, the master retired to a humble abode in Yunyang County. For thirteen years, he sat in silent meditation until the light of his heart shone forth within, manifesting as verses that harmonized with the profound principles of the Dao. He guided hundreds of disciples. Later, he returned to Yan’an.\n\nIn the fifth month, during a great drought, officials and commoners asked the master when rain would come. He replied, “Today there will be light rain, but it will not be enough. After three more days, the moisture will be abundant.” On the appointed day, his words proved true. During the Taihe era, when Qiang raiders invaded, the people were seized with fear. The master calmly said, “Have no concern. Yesterday, in meditation, I saw three thousand headless men driving five hundred great beasts here.” Several days later, a victory dispatch arrived: three thousand enemy heads had been taken, and over five hundred camels captured.

      "translated_text": "One day, while taking a modest drink at a market tavern, he stepped outside to gaze at the heavens, then returned to his seat. Requesting paper and brush, he wrote a hymn:\n\n*A single red sun blazes at the sky’s center,\nFive-colored auspicious clouds swirl above its crown.\nTake heed—with one cry, I depart,\nRiding backward on a dark crane to the eastern sea’s edge.*\n\nHe cast aside the brush, curled his arm beneath his head, and passed away. This occurred on the second day of the twelfth month in the *gengwu* year of the Da’an era, at the hour of noon. He was sixty-one years of age.\n\nHis writings, titled *The Mystic Communion Collection*, circulated in the world. He was buried southeast of the prefectural city. After the fall of the Tianxing regime, his disciples built the Mystic Communion Abbey at his burial site to maintain the incense offerings.\n\nMaster Xue Zhiwei was a native of Hejin County in Hebei, a distant descendant of Tang General Xue Rengui, who had campaigned against Liao. His religious name was Zhiwei, his courtesy name Daoyuan, and his sobriquet the Azure Firmament Master. Born in the *gengwu* year of the Tiande era, he showed no interest in childish play from youth, preferring solitude and silence. As he neared adulthood, he developed a fervent passion for the study of nurturing life and destiny.\n\nIn the *xinmao* year of the Dading era, Master Danyang of the Quanzhen School expounded the teachings on Mount Zhongnan, his reputation resounding far and wide. The master then renounced his wife and children, respectfully sought his presence, and served as a gatekeeper, wielding the whisk to attend upon him. For three years, his devotion remained unwavering. Danyang recognized him as a vessel for the Dao and transmitted to him the secret instructions for cultivating truth.\n\nHaving received the transmission, the master returned to his hometown, where he built a hermitage to dwell in stillness, regulating his *qi* and nourishing his spirit. After six years of such practice, his mind became profoundly settled, and his nature grew clear and luminous. In the *xinchou* year, he journeyed again to the ancestral court to present himself before his teacher and advance in the Dao.\n\nOne evening, the sky was clear and the moon bright. He rose, gathered firewood, and placed it beneath the eaves. The others marveled at his eccentricity, but by dawn, snow had accumulated a foot deep. All then admired his mastery of tranquil concentration, which allowed him to perceive what had not yet come to pass.\n\nIn the *guimao* year, two or three fellow Daoists invited him to travel to Mount Tiantan. The master said, “I have long wished to visit the Wangwu Grotto-Heaven. The ‘Nest of Peace’ there would make a fine lodging.” Upon arrival, the host welcomed them and offered a chamber—spacious, elegant, and adorned with a plaque reading *Nest of Peace*. His companions exchanged glances and sighed, “Truly, the master is a man of the Dao.”\n\nAt that time, Danyang had returned east to the sea. In winter, his Dharma brother Wang Zhi wished to travel to Ninghai to visit their teacher. As they parted, the master wept bitterly, though none could fathom the reason. When Wang reached Ninghai, Danyang had already ascended in transformation twenty days prior.\n\nShortly after, the master returned to his hometown. When Wang Rulin came to visit, the master said, “Why did you not seek a skilled physician to treat your illness in its early stages?” Wang, then in good health, paid no heed to his words.

      "translated_text": "When Chongqing inquired of the scholar Wu Shijie and Xue Guobao about the autumn examination topics, the master replied, “The Three Kings brought peace through rewards and punishments.” When the time came, both men indeed passed the examination.\n\nAnother day, a certain Du Zhongmin came to the hermitage for idle conversation. The master smiled and said, “You should return home at once—your wife, fallen into a well, may yet be saved.” Du rushed home in alarm, and the matter proved just as the master had foretold. Such were his precognitions, all of which came to pass without exception.\n\nLater, he crossed the river southward and wandered among the Song and Shaoshi mountains. Seeking a quieter place, he moved to Neixiang, where he was drawn to the simplicity and beauty of the people. There he built a thatched hut and lived in seclusion, guiding many along the Way. In the winter of the *renchen* year of the Zhengda era (1232), on the third day of the tenth month, he passed away without illness, having lived eighty-three springs and autumns.\n\nHis collected poems and lyrics were titled *The Pure and Empty Collection*. Among his hundreds of disciples, only four—Hou Zhi’en, Liu Zhichun, Tang Zhi’an, and Fan Zhichong—were deemed advanced enough to enter his inner chamber. All four established temples and initiated others into the Dao in Heyang and Yunying, becoming eminent masters of their generation.\n\nAfter the war, the master’s remains were moved and interred beneath Zhongnan Mountain at the Youxian Palace’s Jizhen Hall in Hu County. The Celestial Master Zhenchang, Li Jun, by imperial decree, posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Ascended Perfected of the Mysterious and True*.\n\n---\n\n**Chen Zhiming**\nThe master’s surname was Chen, his given name Zhiming, and his Daoist name Chaozhenzi. A native of Yuan Village in Zhongnan County, he lived next door to Liu Jiang. The Patriarch Chongyang repeatedly sought to convert and guide him, but the master, though wealthy, could not yet abandon worldly entanglements.\n\nLater, when the Four Perfected—Danyang and his companions—came to reside at the ancestral hermitage, the master’s heart inclined toward the Dao. One day, the Patriarch Danyang presented him with a green cloth headwrap and composed a poem:\n\n*A green cloud unfurls to enfold you,*\n*Gazing at you, Chen, I see your destined share.*\n*I hope we may share the same bond,*\n*That you and I may together delight in freedom.*\n*On the path to immortality, seek the golden crucible;*\n*In the land of undying light, gather jade sprouts.*\n*Why settle for transcending only yourself?*\n*Let nine generations of ancestors ascend to the cinnabar heavens.*\n\nMoved by this guidance, the master sighed, “In the past, Chongyang repeatedly sought to convert me, but my foolishness kept me from following his lofty path. If my allotted time should come, how could these meager merits extend my life by even a day?” That very day, he bowed to Danyang as his teacher, changed his robes, and entered the Dao.\n\nDanyang, recognizing the master’s administrative talents, appointed him steward of the ancestral hermitage, where he accumulated merit through virtuous deeds. For a decade, he saved lives through medicine and healing, amassing abundant hidden virtue. Many in the community relied on his protection and shade.\n\nDanyang often composed poems and lyrics to instruct the master in the cultivation of truth through stillness, leading him to profound realization. Later, the master retired and lived in leisure. Danyang appointed Lü Dao’an to succeed him as hermitage steward, while the master devoted himself entirely to spiritual refinement.\n\nIn the *dingsi* year of the Cheng’an era (1207), he suddenly placed his hand on Lü’s back and said, “Your karmic potential is vast. When this hermitage becomes a temple, you will initiate hundreds of Daoists as disciples. At that time, our Way will flourish, and you will be at its heart. Tend well to yourself—I shall soon depart.” With these words, he bid farewell to his companions, then peacefully transformed, living to the age of eighty-one.\n\nHis coffin remained unburied for three days. His body remained supple, and his eyes retained their luster. The following year, the Patriarch Yuyang purchased the ancestral hermitage and established it as the Lingxu Temple. By imperial favor, Lü Dao’an was granted the title *Master of Sublime Emptiness* and entrusted with managing the temple’s affairs and ordination certificates. Later, he indeed initiated nearly three hundred Daoists—just as the master had foretold.\n\n---\n\n**Song Mingyi**\nThe master’s surname was Song, his given name Mingyi, and his Daoist name Zhaoranzi. A native of Fushan County in Dengzhou, his grandfather and father had served as county clerks, earning renown in their village for their integrity and fairness.\n\nFrom childhood, the master studied Confucian classics and excelled in literature. Yet he found the world unworthy of attachment and resolved to leave it behind to study the Dao. In his thirtieth year, he bid farewell to his parents and elders and journeyed directly to Guanzhong. There he took refuge under the Patriarch Danyang, enduring countless trials with a will as unyielding as metal and stone.\n\nIn his spare moments from serving his teacher, he devoted himself to cultivating truth and practicing stillness, progressing daily. Danyang transmitted oral instructions to him and bestowed upon him a green *Yang* headwrap. The master received it with reverence, treasuring his teacher’s gift for the rest of his life. Each morning and on the first and fifteenth days of the month, he would don it, bowing in homage to the Perfected and the Sages.\n\nIn the spring of the *renyin* year of the Dading era (1212), Danyang’s crane-borne carriage returned eastward. The master accompanied him to the sea, where he persuaded his mother, brother, sister, and nephew—six in all—to take refuge under Danyang and enter the Dao.\n\nThe following winter, Danyang ascended as an immortal. The master returned to Guanzhong and resided at the ancestral hermitage. In the *bingwu* year (1206), he led a group to Long Mountain to invite the Patriarch Changchun to return to Zhongnan and propagate the ancestral teachings.\n\nIn the *xinhai* year of the Mingchang era (1191), Changchun’s immortal procession also journeyed eastward. The master received his instructions and was appointed a senior elder of the ancestral hermitage. Thereafter, all who entered the Dao were guided by him as their initiating master.\n\nIn the *bingxu* year of the Zhida era (1316), northern troops advanced, and the people of Qin Chuan were thrown into panic. Many fled to the southern mountains, and the Daoist community took refuge in Migu Valley. The master alone refused to go. When others urged him to flee, he replied, “Where can I escape my karmic debts? You may go—I will remain here to guard this place.”\n\nWithin days, scouting soldiers arrived. The halls of Lingxu Temple were reduced to ashes, and the master was slain. The next day, when the Daoist community descended the mountain to inspect the site, they found his body unmarred, his blood unspilled—a true body of pure yang, akin to those of Xi Kang or Luo Gongyuan. It was the thirteenth day of the tenth month, and he had lived eighty-four years.\n\nIn the spring of the *renzǐ* year of the Zhi Da era (1312), the Celestial Master Zhenchang, Li Jun, by imperial decree, posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of Carefree Truth*.\n\n---\n\n**Lü Dao’an**\nThe master’s surname was Lü, his given name Dao’an. His family had long been prominent in Ninghai. From childhood, he was perceptive and aspired to the mysterious Way.",

When Wang reached Ninghai, Danyang had already ascended in transformation twenty days prior.\n\nShortly after, the master returned to his hometown. When Wang Rulin came to visit, the master said, “Why did you not seek a skilled physician to treat your illness in its early stages?” Wang, then in good health, paid no heed to his words. Yet before a month had passed, he suddenly suffered a stroke and died.",

      "translated_text": "His bearing was that of an immortal, his bones those of a Daoist adept—such gifts were bestowed by nature. He served his parents with filial devotion, renowned throughout his village. At just thirty-two, both parents passed away. After performing the burial rites, he renounced the secular world and entered the Dao.\n\nAt that time, the four masters Ma, Tan, Qiu, and Liu were guarding the tombs on Mount Zhongnan. The master journeyed west alone and paid homage to Master Danyang of the lineage, who hailed from the same village. Knowing the Lü family to be of pure and noble lineage, Danyang had him serve at his side. After years of cultivation, he came to comprehend the subtleties of the Dao.\n\nIn the *gēngzǐ* year of the Dading era (1180), Danyang appointed him abbot of the ancestral temple cloister, where he nurtured the Daoist community. During this time, Master Lingyang Li was still alive, and the master benefited greatly from his guidance. In the *bǐngwǔ* year (1186), Master Changchun of the Longmen lineage arrived at the ancestral temple. Over several years, the master daily received his profound teachings, resolving all doubts and obstacles.\n\nIn the *xīnhài* year of the Mingchang era (1191), when Changchun’s immortal retinue departed, the master cultivated himself with reverence, honored the community, and upheld the Daoist ethos with the same devotion as when his teachers were alive. In the *yǐmǎo* year (1195), after the imperial court’s inspection concluded without granting an official plaque, the cloisters were all seized by the authorities, the ancestral temple among them. From then on, the gates stood desolate, and the Daoist teachings waned.\n\nIn the *dīngsì* year of the Cheng’an era (1207), Perfected Yuyang was summoned to the capital. He dispatched someone to invite the master. The following spring, the master arrived in Yanjing, where Yuyang had purchased the ancestral temple and established it as Lingxu Abbey. He then bestowed upon the master the title *Master of Penetrating Emptiness* and appointed him to oversee the abbey’s affairs, entrusting him with the imperial decrees. He said, “Master Chongyang walked thousands of miles on foot to transform us. It was all for the future of the teaching. Though I cannot go back and forth myself, how could I forget your deep ties to the ancestral temple? Uphold it well.” He also presented him with a poem:\n\n*Great awakening shines with majestic light across the vast sky,*\n*The true瑞 of prior heaven arrives in an instant.*\n*Emptiness and purity endure through all ages,*\n*The supreme Dao flows forth from the true ancestors.*\n*The three realms and ten directions unite as one,*\n*Countless scriptures and discourses reveal boundless truth.*\n*Transcending emotion, the Lord of Heaven’s Origin appears,*\n*Emerging beyond the transformations of yin and yang.*\n\nReturning west to the ancestral temple, the master revived its former glory. Within a few years, those who purchased ordination as Daoists all took him as their teacher. Some three hundred received ordination certificates, and dozens of abbeys were established in Shaanxi.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the second month in the *xīnsì* year of the Xingding era (1221), he instructed his disciples on the path of cultivation. He appointed his dharma brother Bi Zhichang to succeed him as abbot. Then, in perfect harmony, he passed away at the age of eighty. He was buried beside the immortals’ tombs of his teachers.\n\nIn the spring of the *rénzǐ* year of the Zhi Da era (1312), the Celestial Master Zhenchang, Li Jun, by imperial decree, posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of Congealed Emptiness*.\n\n---\n\n**Bi Zhichang**\nThe master’s surname was Bi, his given name Zhichang. His family had long been prominent in Liquan of Qianzhou. He was one of four brothers, all of whom were devoted to the study of purity and non-action.\n\nIn the *rénchén* year of the Dading era (1172), hearing that Master Danyang was propagating the true teaching at the ancestral temple cloister on Mount Zhongnan, he and his brothers came to join his assembly and left the household life. Danyang imparted secret instructions to each and, in stages, presented them with poems and lyrics to guide their progress. All attained profound mastery of the Dao’s mysteries, becoming eminent teachers of humans and gods—though the master was the youngest. He was kept at Danyang’s side, performing menial tasks. Day and night, he received instruction, and over time, he grasped the essentials of cultivating body and nature.\n\nIn the summer of the *rényín* year (1182), Danyang departed for the east. He instructed the master to enter the Long Mountains in the west to serve Master Changchun Qiu, gathering firewood and drawing water for five years. During moments of respite, he sat in solemn stillness through the night, cultivating the practice of tranquil concentration.\n\nIn the *xīnhài* year of the Mingchang era (1191), when Changchun’s immortal retinue departed, he left the master and Lü Dao’an to jointly oversee the ancestral cloister. Though Lü was his elder brother in the Dao, the master treated him with the respect due a teacher.\n\nIn the *yǐmǎo* year (1195), the court’s new policies seized the ancestral cloister for lack of an imperial plaque. In the *dīngsì* year of the Cheng’an era (1207), the master traveled to the coast to visit the various lineage masters. Changchun gave him all his possessions and even composed a petition himself, urging the master to seek alms and rebuild the temple.\n\nThe following spring, the master journeyed to Yanjing. At that time, Yuyang was serving at court and summoned Lü Dao’an to the capital, where he purchased the ancestral temple and established it as Lingxu Abbey. He then bestowed upon the master the title *Master of Communing with the True* and appointed him deputy abbot. Together with Lü, he returned west to the ancestral temple, renewing its Daoist ethos.\n\nThe master was particularly skilled in medicine and healing. Upon hearing of someone’s illness, he would go to their aid without regard for wealth or poverty. In the *xīnsì* year of the Xingding era (1221), Lü Dao’an ascended as an immortal, and the master succeeded him in tending the incense fire at Lingxu Abbey. He oversaw the construction and renovation of many halls, corridors, and cloisters, greatly expanding the Daoist community. Within a few years, he ordained over a hundred disciples.\n\nBefore long, he retired from abbatial duties and withdrew to the Dongzhen Abbey in the Five Surnames area of Qishan County, where he lived in harmony with the world while nurturing his true nature. Occasionally, he would visit Lingxu Abbey to oversee its affairs.\n\nIn the *xīnmǎo* year of the Zhengda era (1231), when war reached Guanzhong, the master fled with the local people to a gorge on Mount Taibai. On the sixteenth day of the third month, he told his disciples, “Yesterday, in meditation, the mountain spirits secretly informed me that this place is no longer safe. We must move elsewhere. The state of the world is such that I cannot bear to witness it.” He then burned incense and bid farewell to the sacred. The next morning, he passed away peacefully. His disciples buried him in the stone chamber where he had lived.\n\nSome locals who heeded his warning and left survived, while those who stayed perished when the soldiers arrived.\n\nIn the winter of the *gēngzǐ* year of the Yuan era (1240), Perfected Dongzhen Yu Jun, by imperial decree, came to reside at the ancestral temple. Recalling that the master had emerged from Danyang’s lineage and had been his close friend, he addressed the assembly, saying, “Master Bi of Communing with the True lived here for fifty years, greatly expanding the ancestral teaching. He was truly a great adept of our lineage.” He then ordered his disciples to exhume the master’s remains and rebury them beside the immortals’ tombs of Liu and Jiang.",

      "translated_text": "In the spring of the *rénzǐ* year (1252), the Perfected Zhenchang Li, then in charge of the teaching, by imperial decree posthumously bestowed upon the master the title \"Perfected of Vast Containment.\"\n\n*The Inner Biographies of the Perfected Immortals of the Ancestral Court of Mount Zhongnan, Volume the Middle* concludes.\n*The Inner Biographies of the Perfected Immortals of the Ancestral Court of Mount Zhongnan, Volume the Lower*\nCompiled by Li Daoqian, the Heavenly Music Daoist of Yi Mountain\n\nThe Perfected of Pure Harmony—his family name was Yin, his given name Zhiping, and his courtesy name Dahe. His distant ancestors resided in Cangzhou, and during the former Song dynasty, one held office in Laizhou, where the family settled. His great-great-grandmother bore seven sons, all of whom passed the imperial examinations and became prefects, five of them attaining the rank of prefectural governor. His great-grandfather Gongzhi and his grandfather Hongyi both concealed their virtue and did not seek renown.\n\nIn the ninth year of the Dading era (1169), on the twentieth day of the first month, the master was born. That night, his mother dreamed of an extraordinary procession in splendid attire entering her chamber. Startled from her sleep, she awoke to find the master already born. The villagers exclaimed in alarm, \"Fire at the Yin residence!\" They rushed to extinguish it, only to find the courtyard illuminated by a radiant light, realizing a son had been born. All declared, \"This family’s hidden virtue has moved Heaven; in time, he will surely become an extraordinary man.\"\n\nAt three, he was precocious and had a keen memory. At five, he entered elementary school, reciting over a thousand characters daily and grasping profound principles with ease. Even in his youth, his demeanor set him apart from ordinary children. Once, while observing sacrificial rites, he pondered the nature of life and death, lost in deep contemplation.\n\nAt fourteen, he encountered the lineage master Danyang and immediately wished to enter the Dao, but his father resisted, and he was taken away. At nineteen, his family again compelled him to return home and confined him, yet he escaped repeatedly until they finally relented. He journeyed to the Lingxu Abbey in Wuguan, where he paid homage to the lineage master Changsheng and became his disciple. Soon after, he resided at the Western Hermitage in Changyi County, often sitting alone beneath a tree until dawn. One night in meditation, he saw Changsheng arrive in an ethereal manner, sever his head, cut open his heart, and replace them. Upon awakening, he gained profound insight.\n\nLater, he dwelled at an abbey in Fushan County, where for years he aided the poor and destitute, earning the people’s reverence. At the beginning of the Mingchang era (1190), hearing that the lineage master Changchun had returned to Qixia, he went to attend him. Changchun held him in high regard, imparting all teachings without reservation. The lineage master Yuyang Wang often clasped his hand to discuss the Dao and transmitted secret oral instructions. He also studied the *Book of Changes* under the lineage master Taigu Hao, learning doctrines unheard of in the world. From then on, his reputation in the Dao grew daily, and his renown spread far and wide. Scholars from all directions flocked to him as their master.\n\nAt the time, the powerful Wanjian clan of Longhu in Weizhou, admiring the master’s virtue, donated garden land to build the Yuqing Abbey in his honor. For years, though attendants and servants surrounded him, none ever saw his face or learned his name, so steadfast was his discipline.\n\nIn the winter of the *jǐmǎo* year of the Xingding era (1219), the Sacred Martial Emperor Taizu of the Great Yuan, returning from the Western Regions, dispatched the plenipotentiary Liu Zhonglu to summon the lineage master Changchun. Zhonglu, along with the Perfected Zhenchang Li of Yidu, remarked, \"Changchun now resides in Penglai. Without first meeting Master Yin, this grand endeavor cannot be accomplished.\" Arriving in Weiyang, Zhonglu paid homage to the master at the Yuqing Abbey. Struck by his dignified and solemn presence, he felt an involuntary reverence, losing his usual composure. When the imperial decree was mentioned, the master rejoiced, saying, \"To awaken the people with this Dao—now is the time!\" He then accompanied Zhonglu to meet Changchun at the Haotian Abbey in Laizhou.\n\nPreviously, neither the Jin nor the Song dynasties’ repeated summons had moved Changchun. Now, he and the master deliberated and resolved to journey north. Eighteen companions, all of eminent virtue, set forth, with the master leading the way. From the spring of the *gēngchén* year (1220) until the autumn of the *guǐwèi* year (1223), their four-year journey was fraught with hardships. After meeting the emperor in the Western Indies and delivering a response that pleased him, they returned to Yunzhong. There, Changchun learned of unrest in Shandong and the southward advance of the imperial troops. He declared, \"The lives of the people there hang by a thread. None but you can save them.\" He then sent the master to offer comfort and pacification. Those who heard him rejoiced to submit, and many lives were spared.\n\nIn the *jiǎshēn* year (1224), an imperial edict commanded Changchun to reside at the Taiji Palace, now known as the Changchun Palace. The master, his most intimate disciple, was revered by followers from all directions. He demurred, \"I have no merit or virtue to deserve such offerings,\" and withdrew to the Longyang Abbey in Dexing. Changchun frequently sent him personal writings, entrusting him with great responsibility, and bestowed upon him the title \"Pure Harmony.\"\n\nAfter Changchun ascended to immortality, the master retreated to the Misty Radiance Abbey in Shanggu. He wished to withdraw entirely from the world, but the community urgently entreated him to assume leadership of the teaching. Reluctantly, he returned to the Changchun Palace to succeed the lineage. Thereafter, disciples and devotees flocked to him, their gifts filling the halls.\n\nIn the spring of the *rénchén* year (1232), the Cultured Martial Emperor Taizong returned from his southern campaign. The master greeted him in Shuntian, where he received warm comfort and inquiry. The emperor then ordered the empress to offer incense at the Changchun Palace on his behalf, bestowing generous rewards.\n\nIn the summer of the *guǐsì* year (1233), the master traveled to Muwen Mountain. Li Xuxuan of the Taixuan Abbey remarked to others, \"Last year, a misty blue *qi* lingered over our abbey for days. Diviners said an extraordinary person would arrive—now the master’s coming confirms it.\" His teachings and transformations during his northern journey are fully recorded in *The Northern Travel Record*.\n\nIn the spring of the *jiǎwǔ* year (1234), he returned south. Upon reaching Yutian, the people rejoiced and urged him to stay for several days. Though the sun had set, he suddenly hastened his departure, traveling fifty or sixty *li* through the night before resting in the tall grass. None understood his reason. Later, upon returning to the abbey, they learned that at the time of his stay in Yutian, a band of raiders had intended to plunder him. Pursuing him to Dahedian, they turned back when they could not overtake him. His followers congratulated one another, saying, \"Without the master, what would have become of us?\"\n\nThat summer, hearing that the court had dispatched officials to pacify Guanzhong, the master met the desireless Perfected Li, who had come from Wei to Yanjing to offer sacrifices at the Hall of Compliance. The master instructed him to enter Guanzhong, gather the Daoist community, and restore the ancestral court of Liu and Jiang on Mount Zhongnan.",

Recalling that the master had emerged from Danyang’s lineage and had been his close friend, he addressed the assembly, saying, “Master Bi of Communing with the True lived here for fifty years, greatly expanding the ancestral teaching. He was truly a great adept of our lineage.” He then ordered his disciples to exhume the master’s remains and rebury them beside the immortals’ tombs of Liu and Jiang.",

      "translated_text": "In the autumn, the court dispatched envoys to convey greetings and bestow a complete collection of Daoist scriptures. In the spring of the *yiwei* year, Du Dekang, the prefect of Qinzhou, invited the master to preside over the Yellow Register Jiao rites. The master traveled south from Yun and Ying, and wherever he passed, multitudes—numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands—lined the roads and fields, prostrating themselves in the dust to welcome him. Those who wished to offer their abbeys as disciples included Yuxu of Gaoliang, Shenqing of Dunxian, Chongyang of Dingxiang, and Xingguo of Pingyao, all of whom entreated him to take charge. When the time came to perform the Jiao rites, the land had long suffered drought and wind, yet for three days and nights, the lamps and candles burned undisturbed, while winds still raged beyond the ritual grounds. Du offered the Shenxiao Abbey of the prefecture as a gift, honoring the master with reverence. The master, attributing the flourishing of the mysterious transformation to the ancestral teacher Chongyang, turned his attention to the ancestral court on Mount Zhongnan.\n\nThat winter, Tian Decan, the chief administrator of Jingzhao, sent officials alongside the desireless Perfected Li to deliver an urgent petition. As their intentions aligned with the master’s, in the spring of the *bingshen* year, on the first month, he at last reached Mount Zhongnan to survey and plan the sacred precincts. Long ago, the ancestral teacher Chongyang had cultivated the Dao in Liujiang Village, and upon achieving realization, he burned his thatched hut and left behind a poem with the words, *\"Later generations shall restore it.\"* Earlier, during the Dading era, the two patriarchs Danyang and Changchun had already undertaken construction, but the conflagration of the Tianxing calamity reduced it nearly to ashes. Now, the master expanded it, and there were verses celebrating the succession of the ancestral restoration.\n\nThus, he leveled the overgrown mounds, built walls, and erected halls, beginning the reconstruction. He also selected venerable elders from the four directions to entrust with the revival of other ruined abbeys, including Zongsheng Abbey of Louguan, Taiping Abbey on Mount Zhongnan, Taiyi Abbey in Tangu, Huaqing Abbey on Mount Li, and Yuntai Abbey on Mount Taihua. At the time, the people of Shaanxi, newly pacified, had yet to settle into stable livelihoods, and the Daoist community struggled to secure food. The master consoled them with teachings on the karmic retribution of virtue and transgression.\n\nThat summer, upon receiving an imperial command, the master chose disciples of strict discipline and pure conduct to reside at Helin, praying for the nation’s blessings. In autumn, Yang Weizhong, the Grand Councilor, summoned him back to Yan. Passing through the Taihang Mountains, bandits knelt in submission, receiving his instruction and becoming law-abiding citizens.\n\nIn the spring of the *wuxu* year, the master suddenly declared, *\"I am old and weary of worldly affairs.\"* On the first day of the first month, he gathered elders from all directions and transmitted the Dharma to Perfected Li of Zhenchang, entrusting him with the seat of teaching. He then renovated the Western Abbey of Changchun and the Five-Flowered Great Chambers, expanding the abbeys to serve as a retreat for his old age.\n\nIn the winter of the *gengzi* year, Yila Baojian, the Grand Preceptor of Jingzhao, and Tian Decan, the chief administrator, invited the master to oversee the burial rites of the ancestral teacher Chongyang. The master gladly accepted, undeterred by the bitter cold and arduous journey. He often said, *\"I do this to repay the ancestral teacher’s kindness.\"* At the time, Shaanxi suffered a severe drought, but as the master arrived, snow fell, and the grand burial rites were solemnly conducted. The following year, on the twenty-fifth day of the first month of the *xinchou* year, the rites concluded. The scale of construction and the logistics of the funeral drew crowds of Daoists and laypeople from all directions, numbering in the thousands. Amid the clamor and unrest, the master’s moral authority and majestic virtue suppressed the chaotic energies, ensuring the completion of the task.\n\nThe master often traveled among the abbeys of Louguan with elder teachers, at ease and carefree, spreading the mysterious transformation. In the winter of that year, on the tenth month, his divine procession returned to Yanshan, where he resided in the Jade Flower Great Chambers. Officials and commoners from near and far revered him like the auspicious star or the vermilion phoenix.\n\nIn the spring of the *yisi* year, he appointed Pan Chonghe to preside over the Pure Yang Abbey in Yongle, Hedong, to oversee its establishment. Soon after, the empress sent attendants to bestow a golden crown and robes, commanding officials to provide protection. He also ordered his disciples to renovate the Jade Clarity Abbey in Weiyang, which, within a few years, was splendidly renewed.\n\nOn the fifth day of the second month of the *xinhai* year, he said to his attendants, *\"I have always favored the seclusion of Fangshan, so I shall reside there. Now, prepare the halls for the Longevity and Ascension Ritual.\"* The next day, after burning incense and paying homage to the sages, he addressed the assembly: *\"I shall soon depart.\"* The crowd was stunned, but the master remained silent, offering only instructions that his burial be simple. He then ceased eating, drinking only water and tea, sitting upright as he discoursed on the Dao, his voice as resonant and clear as ever.\n\nThat night, he adjusted his robes and cap, curled his arm beneath his head, and passed away, having lived eighty-three springs. His disciples wailed as though they had lost their parents, and the room filled with a fragrant aroma. People from near and far rushed to offer condolences and gifts, their procession unending as a marketplace.\n\nEarlier, the master had expressed his wish to be buried in the Great Chambers, but his Dharma heir, Perfected Li of Zhenchang, noted that the Great Chambers were too distant from the capital, making the journey difficult for mourners. Thus, he was interred at the Five-Flowered Chambers, where the Hall of Returning to the True was constructed to tend the incense and offerings.\n\nThe master’s writings, titled *The Baoguang Collection*, circulated in the world. In the autumn of the second year of the Zhongtong era, an imperial edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of Pure Harmony, Wondrous Dao, and Vast Transformation*.\n\n---\n\n**Perfected Zhenchang**\n\nThe master’s clan name was Li, his given name Zhichang, and his courtesy name Haoran. His ancestors hailed from Yongnian in Luozhou, but during the Song dynasty’s decline, they relocated to Fanyang in Pu, then later to Guancheng in Kai, where they settled. His great-grandfather Hao, grandfather Chang, father Man—all concealed their virtue and lived in obscurity, yet were deeply respected by their village.\n\nHis mother, née Nie, dreamed one night of a divine being presenting her with a jade child. Upon waking, she gave birth to the master on the twentieth day of the first month of the *guichou* year of the Mingchang era. At the age of six, both his parents passed away. He was raised in the household of his uncle Jichuan, whose given name was Meng and who was a renowned scholar. Jichuan excelled in both literary composition and righteous conduct, consistently ranking at the top in examinations. Though he sat for the metropolitan exams four times, he never attained the degree of *tong jinshi*.",

      "translated_text": "The master was remarkably perceptive from a young age, his intentions and actions aligning effortlessly to fulfill his long-held aspirations. Yet he disdained ornate rhetoric, favoring instead a life of quiet simplicity. Often in silent prayer to the heavens, he yearned to meet an extraordinary teacher or worthy companion who might match his lifelong aspirations.\n\nAt nineteen, when his uncle began arranging a marriage for him, the master sighed and said: *\"I had hoped to pursue the Dao, yet I have not even crossed its threshold. If I become entangled in worldly desires, how can I ever achieve the lofty endeavors of the sages—transcending the dust of this world?\"* Soon after, he shouldered his books and staff, embarking on a wandering journey like the drifting clouds and flowing waters.\n\nFirst, he secluded himself on Laoshan in Donglai, then traveled to the Immortals’ Palace on Mount Tianzhu. The master of the palace remarked: *\"Master Li of Tangyin possesses keen discernment.\"* Upon seeing the master’s imposing and dignified bearing, he already knew he was no ordinary man. One winter night, as they discussed the Dao and the affairs of daily life, the palace master was deeply impressed. Later, he told his disciples: *\"In my thirty years on this path, among the venerable elders and virtuous masters I have conversed with, none have spoken with such precision as this young man—rarely have I encountered the like.\"*\n\nWhen the master prepared to leave, the palace master finally revealed: *\"You are a vessel of great promise for the Mystic Gate. This mountain hermitage is too remote and desolate for one such as you. In days past, extraordinary figures and ancestral masters emerged from the seaside—now only [Master] Changchun remains. You should seek him out; your future accomplishments cannot be measured.\"*\n\nThe next day, the master set out and arrived at the eastern mountains of Jimo. Amid the chaos of the *Zhenyou* era’s upheavals, local gentry and bandits swarmed like wasps. The mountains held caves large enough to shelter hundreds. When bandits approached, the people would hide inside, but on one occasion, they barred the master from entering. Soon after, he was captured by the bandits. When questioned about the cave’s location, he endured brutal torture—beaten to the point of death, only to revive—yet he refused to reveal it.\n\nAfter the bandits withdrew, those who had hidden in the cave emerged and surrounded him, weeping in gratitude: *\"We, a few hundred common folk, owed our lives to a single word from you. Though we wronged you by refusing you entry, you saved us at the cost of your own life—your virtue far surpasses ordinary human sentiment.\"* They competed to provide for him, ensuring his well-being.

      "translated_text": "In the summer of the *wuyin* year, the sixth month, word reached him that Master Changchun had taken residence in Dengzhou and Laizhou. The master hastily prepared for the journey and went to pay his respects at his seat. At their first meeting, Changchun recognized his exceptional qualities and treated him with uncommon regard. After receiving his teachings, the master redoubled his efforts, unwavering even amid the chaos of war, mortal peril, and hardship.\n\nTian Zuo, the Transport Commissioner of Shandong’s Eastern Circuit, esteemed his conduct and had heard of his past in Jimo, where the military governor Huang Guo and his deputy had sought his counsel to preserve the city. They had invited him to Yidu with a written summons, receiving him with the honors due a guest. In the summer of the *jimao* year, Zhang Lin, deputy commander of Yidu, defected from the Jin to the Song. That winter, in the twelfth month, the August Emperor Taizu dispatched the plenipotentiary Liu Zhonglu with an imperial edict and lavish gifts to summon Master Changchun from Donglai. Observing the turn of events, the master knew that Zhang Lin had recently surrendered the region to the Song and that his allegiance was fickle. He thought to himself: *If I do not speak to him first, I will surely be obstructed.* Thus, he went to persuade Lin, saying: *\"Master Changchun is a man of heaven. Now, three envoys have come to invite him, and he resolutely journeys north. Forsaking the nearer path for the more distant one, his heart for saving the world is plain to see. If you, my lord, can assist his passage, not only will this region be blessed, but it will be an immeasurable boon to all living beings under heaven.\"* Lin was pleased and issued orders along their route, providing an escort for their journey.\n\nIn the spring of the *gengchen* year, the first month, Changchun set out, accompanied by eighteen followers, the master among them. By the second month, they reached Yan. The following spring, they traveled north, arriving in the seventh month at Mount Abu Khan, a mere ten thousand *li* from the Central Plains. There, a thousand households of Han people came forth to greet them with dust rising at their feet, bowing in reverence as if witnessing a once-in-an-era encounter. They entreated Changchun to establish an abbey and select someone to oversee it. From his seat, Changchun pointed to the master and addressed the crowd: *\"This man is enlightened, upright, and erudite. I leave him here for you—treat him well.\"* He bestowed upon him the name *Zhenchangzi* and inscribed the abbey’s name as *Qixia*. After Changchun departed westward, the master led the people in construction, completing the abbey in short order. He also established the Changchun and Yuhua societies, which have endured without interruption to this day.\n\nIn the summer of the *guiwei* year, the fifth month, Changchun returned from his journey and rested at the abbey. One day, as guests gathered for a feast, Changchun silently handed the master a bow and a quiver without a word. The master, likewise silent, accepted them, looped them at his waist, and composed a poem in gratitude. Changchun merely smiled in acknowledgment. For at Abu Khan, leaving the bow and quiver behind was his way of signaling his intent to entrust him with a mission.\n\nIn the seventh month of autumn, they reached the Lower Waters. The lingering heat of late summer was still intense, and Changchun, seeking respite from the cold in the gate tower of an official residence, called the master to him and instructed: *\"A true master is not easily met; one who has attained the Dao is not easily encountered; and even when encountered, they are not easily recognized. Those who hold fast to the Dao, whose conduct is at once human and celestial, who dwell in the body as if it were a temporary abode while their essence remains profound and still—who forget hunger and thirst yet abide in constant peace, who attain perfect stillness and transcend form, who wander alone in the wondrous court of the boundless—these words you must remember, awaiting the day you realize them for yourself.\"* The master bowed in gratitude, then ventured to ask: *\"When I once took refuge in the mountains of Shandong to escape bandits, I was beaten and tortured until I fell into darkness. At midday, the sun blazed, yet my eyes saw nothing, and the paths of light and shadow were sundered. What is the principle of returning to the root and restoring life?\"* Changchun replied: *\"Life and death in man are but the illusory appearances of day and night. Trace the way of these appearances to their source, and you will find there is nothing. When your doubtful thoughts have not yet arisen, examine life and death, day and night—they do not touch you. Then the light of heaven is clear and boundless, like the vastness of the empty sky. Words, teachings, and images cannot describe it; this is where your doubts are stilled.\"* The master bowed again and received his teaching.\n\nAfter Changchun entered the Central Plains, his affairs grew increasingly numerous, and Daoists and laypeople from all directions came to pay their respects, all of whom he entrusted to the master. Though the master harbored a secret desire to retreat into seclusion, he had not yet acted upon it, and even his closest friends were unaware. Suddenly, Changchun said to him: *\"There was once a Daoist named Zhao among my disciples who was diligent in his practice. One day, he abruptly asked to leave for another place. I warned him: ‘If you depart when you should not, you will either regress in the Dao or grow negligent in it.’\"* Startled, the master realized these words were meant for him, and his desire to withdraw vanished.\n\nThe master compiled Changchun’s discourses on the Dao during his audience with the emperor in the Western Regions into *The Western Journey*, which circulated in the world. In the autumn of the *dinghai* year, the seventh month, Changchun ascended as an immortal. Qinghe succeeded him as master of the teachings and appointed the master as *Dudao Lu* (Chief Daoist Registrar), concurrently overseeing the affairs of Changchun Abbey. At the time, the imperial court was in Helin, and the master traveled there once a year, taking it as his duty to uphold the lineage and teachings of the school. Even when the winds and snows of the northern deserts froze his skin, he did not flinch.\n\nIn the autumn of the *gengyin* year, the seventh month, Emperor Taizong ascended the throne. The master was received in the Qianlou Hall. At the time, the emperor had issued an edict summoning scholars versed in the classics to instruct the crown prince. The master presented the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Dao De Jing*, and the *Classic of Filial Piety*. The emperor praised him, and in the winter of the eleventh month, he was granted leave to return.\n\nIn the winter of the *xinmao* year, false accusations arose that the murals in the Central Hall contained inappropriate elements. Qinghe was arrested, and the crowd scattered in alarm. The master alone stepped forward to take his place, saying: *\"Qinghe is the master of our lineage, charged with transmitting the Dao. All matters of the teaching are my responsibility. If there is guilt, let it be mine alone; let no other be implicated.\"* The emissary admired his integrity and agreed, sparing him from restraints and shackles but confining him in prison. At midnight, the shackles suddenly opened on their own. The master informed the jailer, who re-locked them, only for them to open again. The next day, a jailer reported this to the authorities. By chance, the emissary was dining with them, and on the bone of the meat he was eating, the visage of Changchun appeared. The lawsuit was thus dropped.\n\nIn the summer of the *guisi* year, the sixth month, the master received an edict to proceed to the capital at Yanjing, where he was to instruct eighteen sons of Mongol nobles. He recommended the Venerable Jizhao, Feng Zhiheng, to assist him. Day by day, month by month, their talents and skills flourished, earning praise.",
      "overlap_context": "nt of death, only to revive—yet he refused to reveal it.\n\nAfter the bandits withdrew, those who had hidden in the cave emerged and surrounded him, weeping in gratitude: *\"We, a few hundred common folk, owed our lives to a single word from you. Though we wronged you by refusing you entry, you saved us at the cost of your own life—your virtue far surpasses ordinary human sentiment.\"* They competed to provide for him, ensuring his well-being. To this day, the elders of the region still speak of it.",

      "translated_text": "In the autumn of the *yiwei* year, the seventh month, the master received an edict to construct a Daoist abbey in Helin, entrusting him to select eminent Daoists to reside and preside over it.\n\nIn the spring of the *wuxu* year, the first month, during the Pure Harmony Assembly, he gathered venerable elders from all directions. The master personally inscribed a document, entrusting him to succeed the teaching seat. Judging that he could not decline, he accepted. In the third month, he journeyed to the imperial court to memorialize matters concerning the Daoist teachings, beginning with the Lingxu Abbey on Mount Zhongnan—the sacred ground where Ancestral Master Chongyang had refined the true and inaugurated the transformation. By imperial decree, it was renamed Chongyang Abbey, and Jie Dongzhen was appointed to reside as abbot, overseeing the teachings in the Shaanxi region. Baiyun Jinggong and Wuyu Ligong were assigned to assist him, and grand construction commenced.\n\nIn the *yisi* year, he memorialized to request that the Pure Yang Ancestral Shrine in Yongle, Hedong, along with the halls beneath the masters’ true portraits, be bestowed with abbey plaques to manifest the mysterious transformation. In the *bingwu* year, Emperor Dingzong ascended the throne. The master was summoned to perform the Great Universal Offering on the fifteenth day of the first month in the *wushen* year at Changchun Abbey. An imperial edict was issued, commanding that all great abbeys and temples on famous mountains and rivers, as well as eminent Daoist masters, be placed under the master’s authority to confer titles of virtue and power.\n\nIn the autumn of the *xinhai* year, Emperor Xianzong succeeded to the throne and, desiring to observe the sacrificial rites, ordered the offering of sacrifices to the sacred mountains and rivers. In the eighth month, an imperial envoy was dispatched to summon the master to the court. The emperor sat upright upon his throne, personally sealing incense and a letter, concentrating his mind in solemn prayer. He bestowed upon the master a golden tally and an imperial decree, along with five thousand taels of silver from the inner palace to cover the expenses. The master, bearing the edict, traveled south by post carriage to perform the sacrificial rites at the sacred mountains and rivers.\n\nThe following spring, on the first auspicious day of the first month, he arrived at the ancestral abbey on Mount Zhongnan. With reverent devotion, he conducted the sacrificial rites, planned and oversaw construction, and rectified the Daoist regulations. All the immortal abbeys and Daoist temples at the foot of the mountain were visited and restored, with the master’s virtue and bestowed titles varying in degree—such was done because this was the root of the teaching. By the fifteenth day of the fourth month, the immortal retinue returned eastward, stopping at the Pure Yang Abbey on Mount Zhongtiao, where the same rites were observed as at Mount Zhongnan.\n\nIn the ninth month of autumn, he returned to Yanjing. In the winter of the *guichou* year, the tenth month, the sagely emperor, then residing in his princely estate, established a court in the upper capital. The master was commanded to perform the Golden Register Great Fast, acting as Grand Master, universally ordaining Daoist priests and nuns along the routes and conferring upon them precept certificates. In the spring of the *jiayin* year, the first month, an envoy was dispatched to the abbey to convene eminent Daoists from all regions for a Great Universal Offering. The master was charged with delivering the souls of the deceased throughout the realm and was bestowed five hundred taels of gold and five thousand taels of silver. All ritual objects—jade tablets, rings, seals, and offerings of incense and lamps—were provided by the court, from the commencement to the conclusion of the rites. Auspicious omens of phoenixes, cranes, and five-colored clouds were too numerous to record.\n\nThat autumn, upon hearing of the garrison troops at Bo and She, the master dispatched Daoists led by Shi Zhijian to restore the Taiqing Abbey. In the autumn of the *yimao* year, the seventh month, he met the emperor at the traveling palace. At that time, the Western Regions presented tribute, and the crown prince and various princes were in attendance at the banquet. The master was commanded to join them.\n\nOn the first day of the twelfth month, the emperor addressed the master, saying: “I wish for all the people under heaven to live in peace and contentment, yet I have not found those who share this heart with me. What should be done?” The master memorialized: “Since ancient times, when a sagely ruler cherishes the people, men of talent and virtue will surely respond to his sincerity and come forth.” He then enumerated the joint employment of meritorious officials and worthy ministers. The emperor praised and accepted his counsel. From noon until the lighting of the lamps, the master remained in audience, receiving the emperor’s inquiries, before retiring.\n\nIn the spring of the *bingchen* year, the first month, he petitioned to retire due to old age. In the summer, the fourth month, he returned from the northern court. On the first day of the sixth month, the *gengshen* day, weary of constant engagements, he withdrew from worldly affairs, resting against his desk in silence. On the *wuyin* day, he sat upright with solemn dignity and addressed his attendants: “Last night, the realm I beheld was extraordinary. I know my allotted time has come; the hour of my return has arrived.” He entrusted the succession of his duties to Zhang Zhijing, whom he had previously memorialized as his successor, leaving no room for debate.\n\nThe following day, he composed a final verse and passed away in perfect accord with the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "At sixty-four years of age, he was interred at Cuncun Hall on Wuhua Mountain. His writings from former days included the *Anthology of Further Mystery* in twenty scrolls, which circulated in the world. In the autumn of the *xinyou* year of the Zhongtong era, the ninth month, an imperial edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title \"Perfected of True Constancy, Supreme Virtue, and Proclaimed Teachings,\" with the honorific \"Perfected of the Cavernous Realms.\"\n\nThe Master’s religious name was Shanqing, styled Boxiang, a native of Ninghai. He descended from the eminent Han dynasty magistrate Yugong of the Gao family. His grandfather, Yan-sheng, once served as a minor official in Haoshi County. His father, Zhen, concealed his brilliance and never entered public service.\n\nThe Master was born on the eighth day of the twelfth month in the *bingxu* year of the Dading era (1166). From childhood, he abstained from meat. As he grew, he mastered the classics and histories and developed a refined passion for the study of the Dao, virtue, and the cultivation of life. He hailed from the same village as the Patriarch of Danyang. In the summer of the *renyin* year, the fifth month of the twenty-second cyclical count (1182), Danyang returned from the western regions of Shaan to his hometown and expounded the Dao at Golden Lotus Hall, drawing crowds of elders and children alike. The Master, then seventeen, attended with poise and striking refinement. Danyang, upon seeing him, inquired and learned he was the grandson of Yan-sheng. Sighing, he said: “I once feared the reproaches of Chongyang and nearly faltered in my resolve, yet it was Yan-sheng’s steadfast support that enabled me to complete my work. If this youth enters the Dao to repay his grandfather’s virtue, would that not be fitting?” The following day, the Master returned with the assembly. Danyang produced a cooked taro and offered it to him; the Master bowed and ate it.\n\nHis parents, upon hearing this, stood by with a small table and staff, awaiting instruction. Danyang then bestowed upon him his present religious name and style. Thereafter, his father Zhen and his mother, née Wang, conferred: “This child is the sole heir to our ancestral sacrifices. Now that Danyang has guided him into the Dao, it must be by long-standing karmic affinity. Danyang was once a Confucian scholar and would not rashly sever our family’s lineage. Yet the gate of self-cultivation surely transcends worldly concerns. What, then, do we cling to?” They, along with their daughter and household, all took refuge under Danyang’s guidance. Danyang instructed Zhen with the religious name Daoji, Wang with Daoqing and the sobriquet \"Jade Creek Recluse,\" and their daughter with Miaojing—she being the Master’s elder sister. Later, all became venerable figures in the Daoist tradition.\n\nIn the winter of the following year, *guimao* (1183), the Master accompanied Danyang to Yuxian Abbey in Laiyang for the offering of a grand jiao ritual.",

He fully conveyed the commands of Changsheng and Yuyang, and Lingyang, observing the Master’s refined and serene bearing—his every gesture uncommon—taught him to dwell in mountain forests, shun the dust of markets, draw near to those of the Dao, and cultivate fields of merit. He further instructed him to detour to Pingdong to visit the eminent scholar Cui Yangtou.\n\nThe Master followed the command and set forth. One evening, he lodged at the Palace of the Queen Mother of Huishan, where in the night he dreamed of an old woman offering a tray of cakes to a Hu barbarian-headed Daoist. The Daoist took one cake, broke it in half, and gave half to the Master to eat, then ate the other half himself. Two days later, he arrived at Cui’s hermitage in Pingdong. No sooner had he completed his bows than an old woman entered bearing a tray of cakes to present to Cui. Both Cui and the woman were the very figures from his dream. Cui took one cake, broke it in half, and gave half to the Master to eat, then ate the other half himself, saying, “With the one from the other night, you have now eaten a whole cake of mine.” At that moment, Zhao Jiugu stood by, and Cui pointed to the Master, saying, “This one is teachable—perhaps he bears the green thread of the Dao.” After residing there for several months, he received much guidance and instruction.\n\nHe then took leave and traveled to Longmen Mountain in Longzhou to attend upon Changchun, humbly tending the hearth and drawing water. In the spring of *yisi* (1185), Changchun sent the Master to Luoyang to deliver a letter to the Patriarch Changzhen. Changzhen instructed him that the essentials of learning the Dao lay in subduing arrogance, tempering sharpness, and forging the dust-laden heart. Before long, Changzhen returned to the True, and the Master performed the burial rites before re-entering the Pass. He begged for alms in Tong and Hua, practicing what he had been taught.\n\nIn *bingwu* (1186), Changchun descended from Mount Long and revived the teachings at the ancestral court. He summoned the Master to his seat and ordered him to serve diligently each day, thereby weaving a bond of profound affinity. Earlier, when Changchun had traveled through the Long River region, he had admired the Stone Gate in Kuangyang County of Jingyang and, finding it an auspicious site, built a Quanzhen Hall, appointing his disciple Pu Cha Daoyuan to reside there. In the *xinhai* year of the Mingchang era (1191), as Changchun prepared to return to the eastern seas, he said to the Master, “Your affinity lies here—go nowhere else. One needs companions to succeed, and companions must be chosen with care. Pu Cha Daoyuan’s heart abides in the Supreme Dao; he will surely aid in the completion of your work. Go and dwell with him.”\n\nThe Master then journeyed to the Five Sacred Peaks of Mount Hua, where he hewed stone to make his dwelling. He ate but one meal a day and remained sleepless day and night for seven years. Devoting himself solely to the Dao, he attained the wondrous. Whatever had not yet come to pass, he knew in advance. To this day, the people of Long call his grotto “The Cave of the Perfected Yu,” where they have fashioned an image to honor him. Pu Cha later invited the Master to descend the mountain and dwell together.",

Danyang instructed Zhen with the religious name Daoji, Wang with Daoqing and the sobriquet \"Jade Creek Recluse,\" and their daughter with Miaojing—she being the Master’s elder sister. Later, all became venerable figures in the Daoist tradition.\n\nIn the winter of the following year, *guimao* (1183), the Master accompanied Danyang to Yuxian Abbey in Laiyang for the offering of a grand jiao ritual.",

      "translated_text": "In the year *cheng'an wuwu* (1198), local patrons in the prefecture donated funds to construct a temple, which they named Jade Clarity Abbey. Soon after, they respectfully invited Master Yuyang to transmit scriptures and registers, aiding in the cultivation of the Dao and the salvation of beings. From near and far, reverence for him grew ever deeper.\n\nIn the year *taihe guihai* (1203), the governor of Longzhou bestowed upon him the title \"Master of Tranquil Emptiness.\" Five years later, in *yichou* (1205), he returned to Restful Radiance Abbey. Master Changchun urged him to advance in the Dao, but before long, Changchun hastened west to return home. Passing through Linyi, he encountered Master Yuyang at the county seat. Yuyang first asked, \"In Guanzhong, with whom do you keep company?\" The Master replied, \"Pu Cha.\" Yuyang then inquired about Pu Cha’s entry into the Dao, and the Master recounted how he had followed Changchun’s command. Yuyang said, \"If that is so, then he is indeed a worthy companion.\" Thereupon, he imparted subtle teachings and bestowed the title \"Master of Cavernous Perfection.\"\n\nAfter several days, they parted. Traveling through Linlü, the Master admired its secluded beauty and took up residence at Heavenly Peace Abbey. In the year *bingyin* (1206), Changchun sent Bi Zhichang with a letter of instruction, saying: \"Generally, those of the highest capacity distance themselves only from wealth and sensuality. Since you have already renounced wealth and embraced righteousness, why remain in the depths of mountains and valleys to guard stillness so earnestly?\" The letter concluded: \"Upon receiving this, descend the mountain at once and return to aid the people of Ji and Long. At present, the Teaching lacks capable hands—you must propagate it widely.\" He also instructed the Master to change his name to \"Aspiring Dao.\" The Master bowed in acceptance and returned to Qin.\n\nIn the eighth year, *wuchen* (1208), after the southern campaign ended in triumph, he was moved by the many captives who had been ransomed and redeemed. Since completing his studies under the Five Perfected Ones, hundreds had come to his door seeking ordination as Daoist priests. He established abbeys for them throughout the region between Fengxiang, Fen, and Long.\n\nIn the year *yuanguang guiwei* (1223), he was appointed director of the Central Abbey of Supreme Oneness in Bianliang, but when Li Chongxu recommended him as his successor, he declined. In the first year of *Zhengda* (1224), the emperor mourned the fallen western troops and dispatched Minister of Rites Zhao Bingwen to conduct a sacrificial rite at Pingdong. The Master was invited to preside over the salvation ritual. He presented all the offerings he had received and donated them to the military.\n\nZhao, who had long admired the Master’s lofty purity, had his portrait painted and recommended him to the court. An imperial summons was issued, but the Master again declined. Later, when bandits ravaged the Long Mountains, Bi Zhichang invited him to reside in Cavernous Perfection Abbey in Qishan, a humble dwelling among the Five Clans. In the year *bingxu* (1226), an imperial envoy was sent to summon him once more. This time, he rose and answered the call. Upon arriving in the capital, he was appointed director of the Central Abbey of Supreme Oneness. Ministers such as Mi Guogong Zhu, Marquis Shen Gong Zhi, Minister Yang Yunyi, Censor Xu Gu, and Academician Feng Bi—all high-ranking officials—vied to admire and emulate him.\n\nAt that time, the Jin dynasty’s fate was nearing its end. Corvée labor and taxes multiplied, and the people suffered greatly. Levies were imposed even on Daoists and Buddhists. The Master often interceded with the authorities, persuading them to abandon such measures. Monks and priests from all directions found refuge in his protection.\n\nIn the year *dinghai* (1227), Daoist communities from the north reported that Changchun had ascended to immortality on Mount Yan. The Master ate but one meal a day and observed a heart-mourning for three years. In *gengyin* (1230), when Henan suffered a drought, the emperor ordered the imperial attendants to escort the Master to perform prayers for rain at the Altar of Relief. The emperor himself awaited the rites within the palace. As soon as the ritual concluded, sweet rain fell, and the emperor issued a special decree of praise, appointing him to oversee the affairs of the Five Sacred Peaks’ Protector Deities Abbey. That autumn, the harvest was abundant.\n\nIn the spring of *tianxing guisi* (1233), Bianjing surrendered to the sagely court. The imperial court dispatched envoys to seek out masters of the Three Teachings, and the Master was named foremost among them. In the seventh month of autumn, he crossed northward from Zhongle. Many followed him, and the boatmen, suspecting he carried gold and silk, set sail at dusk. They stopped at a sandbar, claiming they had reached the shore, and abandoned the passengers. At dawn, the Master and his companions found themselves surrounded by surging waves, yet he remained calm and unafraid. That very day, the embankment at Eight Willows collapsed, and the floodwaters rushed south. The Master ordered his disciple Fu Daoqing to hire two boats, rescuing all those in peril. Thus, they arrived safely in Daming.\n\nAt the time, Master Xuantong Fan Yuanxi presided over the Supreme Clarity Abbey in Dongping. Hearing of the Master’s arrival, he led the local officials and Daoist communities to welcome him with carriages and horses, offering him the seat of honor. The Master declined but, unable to refuse, began propagating the Teaching in the eastern plains.\n\nIn the autumn of *yiwei* (1235), he journeyed north to Yanjing to pay respects at Changchun’s Hall of Compliance. The people of Yan earnestly entreated him to stay, and he could not return south. In the summer of *bingshen* (1236), locusts and drought ravaged the Yan region. The officials of the Branch Secretariat implored the Master to perform exorcisms and prayers. Yielding to their pleas, he conducted a ritual, and rain fell at once; the locusts caused no harm.\n\nIn autumn, Master Pure Harmony Yin returned from Guanzhong to Yan and instructed Zhenchang Li to build a chamber in the western courtyard, where he and the Master could reside opposite each other, daily enjoying each other’s company. In the spring of *wuxu* (1238), Zhenchang succeeded to the leadership of the Teaching.\n\nIn the fourth month of summer, the court selected and examined Daoists and Buddhists. Given the Master’s eminent reputation, he was granted the title \"Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery, Vast Virtue, and Cavernous Perfection.\" Around that time, the Beijing Prefect Wudeheng constructed a Complete Perfection Abbey and invited the Master to serve as a model for the people of the state. He reluctantly agreed and set out.\n\nIn the seventh month of autumn, Zhenchang memorialized the throne and received an edict renaming the Lingxu Abbey on Mount Zhongnan as Chongyang Palace, appointing the Master as its abbot and overseer of the Teaching in the Shaanxi region. In the summer of *gengzi* (1240), the Grand Preceptor Yila Baojian and the Jingzhao Governor Tian Decan sent envoys with petitions to invite him. He set out that very day. The officials and commoners of Yan, knowing he was restoring the ancestral sanctuary, could not detain him. Gifts of gold, silk, and other valuables filled his path. Passing through Yan, Zhao, and Jin, he arrived in Qin. Wherever he went, the local lords welcomed him beyond the city gates, and the gentry and common folk vied to pay him homage. All the funds he received were devoted to construction and restoration.\n\nIn the spring of *xinchou* (1241), he convened masters and disciples from all directions to inter the Patriarch in the White Cloud Hall. At that time, the Guanzhong region had only recently been pacified; the land was sparsely populated and vast. His disciples, mindful of the Patriarch’s transformative virtue, competed to enter the passes, cultivating the land and establishing abbeys to support the Teaching. Their influence extended east to the seas and Mount Tai, west to Gong and Tao, south to the Yangtze and Huai rivers, and north to the deserts.",

      "translated_text": "The flow of Daoists and layfolk bearing incense and offerings never ceased. Together with the laborers working on the Li Palace, their number never fell below several thousand, all sustained by the Master’s profound virtue. On the first and fifteenth of each lunar month, he would invariably hold a vegetarian feast, gather the assembly, and instruct them in cultivating the body and nurturing the nature as their practice, establishing abbeys and initiating others as their conduct, and expounding the principles of sin and blessing so that each might follow what suited them. Thus, all adhered to the rules and observed the precepts, and the Teaching remained serene and undisturbed. Within a decade, grand abbeys and towering halls dotted the land of the Three Qins like stars scattered across the sky. The ancestral abbey’s system became the finest of all jade halls in the realm.\n\nAt the place where the Ganhé Patriarch had encountered the True One, the Master built the Encountering Immortals Abbey to manifest the numinous traces. Furthermore, at the Western Peak’s Fanxi, where Master Changchun had refined and transformed, he dispatched a thousand disciples to establish the Changchun Attainment of the Dao Abbey in gratitude for the Teaching’s virtue. The Vanguard Commander of Jiagu, acting as the benefactor of the ancestral abbey, built the Hall of the August Void and invited the Master to conduct a Grand Offering of the Luo Heaven on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the *jiachen* year (1244), to deliver and console the departed souls throughout the realm. Coinciding with its completion, Prince Kuoduan, the Great King, established his office in the Western Regions. He sent the emissary Zhao Chongjian to the abbey to perform the Golden Register Offering for seven days and nights. As the sacred writ descended, the True Writs of the Northeast spontaneously ignited without fire. When the emissary returned and reported this marvel, the Prince issued an imperial edict to protect and uphold the Mysterious Teaching, further bestowing the name \"Wanshou Palace of Chongyang\" upon the abbey and conferring the title of \"Perfected\" upon the five masters who conducted the offering—the Master, along with Song Piyun, Xue Taixia, Huang Baiyun, and Li Wuyu.\n\nIn the fifth lunar month, the imperial decree dispatched the imperial attendant Pei Tianmin to the abbey, presenting imperial incense and granting special favor. In the autumn of the *bingwu* year (1246), Wang Dezhen, the Grand Marshal of Gongchang, wished to invite the Master to perform an offering to console his late father’s spirit. Fearing the Master would be unable to travel, he petitioned the Prince’s court. As Wang was a founding minister of the state, the Prince commanded the Chancellor Wanyan Fengge to respectfully journey to Zhongnan and extend the invitation, to which the Master assented. Gongchang bordered the Western Qiang, whose inhabitants were accustomed solely to the Buddhist Teaching. The Master transformed them with the Dao of non-action, purity, rectifying the mind, and sincerity, and their customs were thereby entirely altered.\n\nIn winter, he expounded the Teaching at Qinting, responding to the near and far with boundless compassion. The literati of Qin compiled the *Record of the Western Regions*. In the spring of the *dingwei* year (1247), he returned to the abbey. In the eighth lunar month of autumn, the Empress Dowager bestowed upon him a ceremonial cap and robe, along with a precious edict, commanding local officials to protect and uphold the Mysterious Transformation without allowing disturbances.\n\nIn the summer of the *gengxu* year (1250), the Hall of Illuminating Clarity was completed. The Master, leaning on his staff, strolled beneath it and said: \"I have devoted myself to the ancestral abbey and managed the construction of this hall for nearly a decade, and only now do I see its completion. Yet this is not merely to boast of its grandeur. For the common mind, when one sees the solemn adornment without, reverence naturally arises within. As for those of superior attainment who cultivate the body through purity, tranquility, and the cessation of thoughts, this may not concern them. Yet in propagating the Teaching and delivering others, such symbolic constructions and lofty edifices cannot be entirely neglected. The Teaching is exalted because the Dao is honored.\"\n\nOn the third day of the tenth lunar month in winter, he bathed, composed himself, and sat upright. Summoning the assembly before him, he entrusted them with instructions for their cultivation. As the sun reached its zenith, he left a final verse and passed away in the Hall of Myriad Wonders, at the age of eighty-five. For nine days, offerings were made, and his complexion remained as if alive. Daoists and layfolk from near and far, bearing fly-whisks and presenting funeral gifts, numbered in the tens of thousands. He was interred in the Immortals’ Garden of the abbey, beside Masters Yuchan and Lingyang.\n\nHis poems, hymns, and works on delivering others and propagating the Dao were compiled into the *Hongzhong Collection*, which circulated in the world. The Hanlin Academician Meng Panlin composed an essay, and the literati of Chang’an specially came to the ancestral abbey to offer sacrifices. Yang Huan, the Transport Commissioner of Henan, composed a stele inscription on his virtuous conduct.\n\nIn the *wuyin* year of the Zhiyuan era (1278), the Hall of Reflecting on the True was built behind the White Cloud Hall, where an image was installed for offerings.\n\n---\n\n**Perfected Piyun**\nThe Master’s surname was Song, his given name Defang, and his courtesy name Guangdao. He was a native of Yecheng in Laizhou. His ancestors were renowned for their accumulated goodness. On the night of his birth, villagers saw an auspicious light illuminating his home, brighter than the sun. This occurred on the first day of the eighth lunar month in the *guimao* year of the Dading era (1183), and people marveled at it. As soon as he could speak, he loved reading and did not engage in childish play. Gifted with keen intelligence and a retentive memory, those who knew him said his nature had been nurtured in past lives.\n\nAt the age of twelve, he asked his mother: \"Can one avoid death?\" She replied: \"Go ask the Perfected Liu, the Divine Immortal.\" At that time, Master Liu Changsheng was propagating the Teaching at the Martial Palace. The next day, the Master went directly to him. Upon seeing him, Changsheng loved his refined bone structure and extraordinary speech, keeping him by his side to attend to his needs. In the course of serving—sweeping, responding, and attending—Changsheng discerned his pent-up aspirations and imparted the true Dharma to awaken him. Having received this guidance, the Master cultivated and nurtured himself day and night without rest.\n\nLater, he was ordained by Master Yuyang and registered as a Daoist. After Changsheng ascended as an immortal, he served Master Changchun at Qixia. He was particularly fond of Confucian and Daoist classics such as the *Book of Changes*, the *Laozi*, the *Doctrine of the Mean*, the *Great Learning*, the *Zhuangzi*, and the *Liezi*. Though he also perused the *Book of Poetry*, *Book of Documents*, philosophers, and histories, he extracted from them the learning of exhausting principle and fulfilling the nature. Through immersion, practice, silent comprehension, and luminous penetration, his actions invariably accorded with the Dao, and his daily renewal could not be concealed.\n\nIn the spring of the *gengchen* year (1220), the Great Ancestor, Emperor Shengwu of the Great Yuan, dispatched the imperial attendant Liu Zhonglu to summon Changchun from the eastern shores of the sea. Among the eighteen chosen to accompany him, the Master was one. After three years of travel, they returned to Yan and resided at the Changchun Abbey. At that time, all who followed Changchun labored diligently.",

      "translated_text": "The Master alone remained composed, finding solace in the zither and books. When others criticized him to Changchun, Changchun rebuffed them, saying: \"Do not clamor against this man. In the future, when it comes to the great enterprise of upholding the lineage and spreading the teachings, none of you will match him.\"\n\nChangchun once privately remarked to the Master: \"Your destiny lies in the southwest, does it not?\" The Master then spoke of the Daoist scriptures falling into decay and the need to restore them. Changchun replied: \"This is a matter of great magnitude. I have no leisure to attend to it as well. Yet in the unseen, there must be one who will take charge of it. One day, you shall assume this task.\" He then bestowed upon him the name *Piyunzi* (\"Cloud-Disperser\").\n\nAfter Changchun’s ascension, Qinghe succeeded him in overseeing the teachings. He appointed the Master to supervise the religious order, and in every action, the Master was impartial yet governed by rules. All within and beyond the Daoist community submitted to him in heart.\n\nIn the *guisi* year (1233), the Grand Chancellor Hu Tianlu, then serving as the regional commissioner in Hebei, invited him to preside over the jiao rites. In the *jiawu* year (1234), he traveled to the Western Mountains of Taiyuan, where he discovered the ancient Wutian Abbey. Its original site contained two stone grottoes, both still adorned with solemn Daoist statues, and the walls bore the characters \"Song Tong.\" The Master spent three years restoring the abbey, and its halls and pavilions rose majestically, resplendent with gold, azure, and cinnabar—like a dragon’s head emerging, a veritable cave-heaven.\n\nIn the *dingyou* year (1237), he again presided over the jiao rites in Pingyang. While at Xuandu Abbey, he recalled Changchun’s words during moments of leisure in the past: \"The matter of the canon is of great importance. I have no time for it, but one day, you shall take it up.\" And again: \"Your destiny lies in the southwest.\" The Master privately reflected: \"My teacher, Changchun, possessed the power of divine transformation and celestial destiny, manifesting the marvel of foresight. Whatever he spoke of beforehand invariably came to pass. His words about my destiny in the southwest—I have already settled and fulfilled them. Why then should I hesitate regarding the canon?\"\n\nThus, he consulted with his disciple, the lecturer Tongzhenzi Qin Zhian, and devised a plan to cast woodblocks for the scriptures’ dissemination. When Chancellor Hu learned of this, he was delighted and contributed a thousand taels of silver to initiate the project. He then entrusted Tongzhenzi with overseeing the endeavor at Xuandu Abbey in Pingyang. By the time the work was completed, it adhered precisely to the original plan, as recorded in the stele inscription composed by the Hanlin Academician Li Leng. From the inception to the conclusion, every detail was meticulously documented.\n\nIn repairing omissions, gathering lost texts, and scouring the land for remnants, he traversed tens of thousands of miles across the realm. Had another undertaken this task, they would have either been overwhelmed by its complexity or wearied by its labor.",

Among the eighteen chosen to accompany him, the Master was one. After three years of travel, they returned to Yan and resided at the Changchun Abbey. At that time, all who followed Changchun labored diligently.",

      "translated_text": "The Master, still with energy to spare, then opened the Nine Yang Caverns at Mount Shen in Laizhou and established Daoist abbeys and temples—from Yan to Qin and Jin, nearly forty in all. In the spring of the *xinchou* year, during the first month, he attended the interment of Ancestral Master Chongyang at Zhongnan. In the *guimao* year, he traveled from Gantang to Yongle Town and paid homage at the shrine of Pure Yang. Finding it desolate and cramped, he gathered Daoist followers to reside there. Though later it was Master Zhenchang Li who petitioned the imperial court to undertake grand renovations, the Master had laid the foundation for the endeavor.\n\nIn the spring of the *jiachen* year, he arrived at the ancestral sanctuary in Zhongnan to officiate the jiao rites for Prince Kuoduan, the Great King. Upon the rites’ conclusion, he was conventionally bestowed the title *Xuandu Zhidao Zhenren* (\"Perfected One of the Mysterious Capital and the True Dao\"). By this time, the transmission of the scriptural canon and its superior lineage had already ceased. He then retired to Snow Hall, where he daily conversed on the Dao with elders and venerable masters. On the eleventh day of the tenth month in the *dingwei* winter, he bathed, changed his robes, and, after manifesting a minor illness, passed away in the Pavilion of Awaiting Cranes at his residence, aged sixty-five. Seven days later, he was interred in the Immortal’s Transcendence Garden of the abbey.\n\nDuring his lifetime, his collected poems and prose were compiled into *Lequan* (\"Joy in Wholeness\"), in two volumes, which circulated in the world. In the winter of the *wushen* year, his disciples relocated his immortal remains to Pure Yang Abbey in Yongle Town, Hedong, where they buried him, erected a shrine, and established a site for incense offerings. In the spring of the first month of the *gengwu* year of the *Zhiyuan* era, an imperial edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Xuantong Hongjiao Piyun Zhenren* (\"Perfected One of Mysterious Penetration, Vast Teaching, and Cloud-Dispersing\").\n\n**White Cloud Perfected One**\nThe Master’s surname was Jing, his given name Zhiyuan, and his courtesy name Zixuan. His family was a prominent clan of Ye County in Laizhou. His grandfather, Dezhong, and his father, Zun, both cherished reclusion in the countryside and were renowned in their village for their hidden virtues. During the *Huangtong* era, when famine left the fields strewn with withered grass, his family distributed congee to the starving, continuing until the autumn harvest.\n\nIn the *Dading* *jichou* year, Ancestral Master Chongyang, accompanied by Masters Danyang, Changzhen, and Changchun, passed by his home. They were invited in, where a vegetarian feast was prepared in their honor. Later, in his hometown, the Master established Longxiang Abbey, where he maintained daily incense offerings to the Supreme Perfected. On the nineteenth day of the first month in the *Gengxu* year of the *Dading* era, he was born. As a child, he avoided frivolous play. When he reached the age of study, his parents urged him to read, but he replied, \"What I aspire to study is the cultivation of the True beyond the worldly.\" In his twentieth year, his parents sought to arrange his marriage. Upon hearing this, he secluded himself in a quiet chamber and purified himself. His family, recognizing his unshakable resolve, permitted him to don the robes of a Daoist. Soon after, he journeyed to Qixia to study under Ancestral Master Changchun. After long and diligent service, he attained realization in the Dao.\n\nBefore long, he followed Changchun to reside at Wutian Abbey in Laizhou. In the *jimao* year, Emperor Taizu the Sagely and Martial dispatched envoys with an imperial summons for Changchun to journey to the northern court. In the first month of the following spring, the journey commenced, with eighteen disciples selected to accompany him—among them, the Master. Through frost and dew, they traveled back and forth for three years, enduring the hardships of the road. Upon reaching the summit of Mount Jin, they rested briefly in a grove. Changchun turned to Minister Qinghe, Yin, and said, \"This disciple’s nature is pure and earnest; in the future, our teaching may rely heavily upon him.\"\n\nWhen Changchun returned to Yanjing and took residence at Changchun Abbey, the Master served with even greater diligence. After Changchun ascended to immortality, Qinghe succeeded to the seat of teaching and entrusted the Master with the affairs of Changchun Abbey, bestowing upon him the title *Baiyunzi* (\"Master of White Cloud\"). Later, he was dispatched to proselytize in the eastern mountains. Wherever he went, he was ceaselessly welcomed and approached. With kind words, he exhorted the people, and elders from all directions, bearing gifts, filled his hall—too many to count.\n\nIn the spring of the *wuxu* year, Master Zhenchang Li succeeded to the leadership of the teaching. In the fourth month of summer, he entered the imperial court to pay homage, with the Master accompanying him. In the seventh month of autumn, Zhenchang petitioned the throne and received an edict commanding the Master, along with Master Dongzhen Yu, to reside at Chongyang Abbey in Zhongnan Mountain and oversee the affairs of the Daoist teaching in the Shaanxi region. Upon returning to Yanjing, Qinghe said to the Master, \"The words spoken by Changchun on Mount Jin have now come to pass. You must exert yourself diligently, that the work may never cease.\" The Master expressed his gratitude and journeyed west.\n\nIn the *gengzi* year, he led the officials of Jingzhao to Yanjing once more to formally invite Qinghe to preside over the interment of Ancestral Master Chongyang. Thereafter, in the restoration of the ancestral sanctuary, the Master contributed many plans. He also oversaw renovations at Xuandu Wanshou Abbey in the capital of Jingzhao Prefecture and Taiyi Abbey in Tangu Valley.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first month in the *jiachen* year, Prince Kuoduan, the Great King, dispatched his envoy Zhao Chongjian to the abbey to conduct the Golden Register jiao rites, which lasted seven days and nights. When the envoy returned, he reported wondrous signs, prompting the prince to issue a special edict protecting the Mysterious Teaching. All five masters who participated in the rites were bestowed honorific titles, and the Master was conventionally granted the title *Xuemen Hongjiao Baiyun Zhenren* (\"White Cloud Perfected One of the Vast Teaching of the Mysterious Gate\").\n\nIn the winter of the *bingwu* year, the Empress Dowager bestowed upon him a golden crown and robes, granting him exceptional favor. In the *xinhai* year, Emperor Xianzong ascended the throne and issued an imperial edict commanding the Master to continue overseeing the Daoist affairs of the Shaanxi region as before.\n\nIn the winter of the *renzi* year, when the western region of Shu had not yet fully submitted, a reckless individual falsely accused the Daoist community of colluding with the people of Shu. The authorities led troops to conduct a severe investigation, causing the Daoist followers to scatter in terror. In the fourth month of the following summer, when the Sagely Emperor was at the Six Panels traveling palace in his princely residence, the Master went to pay his respects and pleaded the truth of the matter. He received an imperial rescript offering comfort and reassurance, allowing several hundred of his disciples to live in peace. They established over twenty abbeys and temples.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month in the autumn of the *yimao* year, he manifested a minor illness and passed away in the abbot’s chamber of Xuandu Abbey, aged sixty-six. Initially, he was interred at Baiyun Abbey in Fanchuan, but later his remains were relocated to the Immortal’s Transcendence Garden of the Liu-Jiang ancestral sanctuary.\n\n**Perfected One of No Desires**\nThe Master’s ancestral home was in Meiyuan, Yaozhou. His surname was Li, his given name Zhiyuan, and his Daoist name Wuyuzi (\"Master of No Desires\"). He was born on the tenth day of the twelfth month in the *jichou* year of the *Dading* era. At five, he began to walk, and as he grew, he was forthright, resolute, and unyielding, priding himself on his integrity.",

      "translated_text": "In his hometown, there were cunning and deceitful men, but whenever he confronted them with forthright words, they would gaze at him in awe and submission. He often indulged in wine without restraint, regarding the world as unworthy of his concern. At thirty-seven, he declared: \"Rather than drowning in the dusty halls of this world, why not wander beyond its confines?\" At that time, Yang Bixu was vigorously propagating the teachings of the Quanzhen School in Chang’an. The Master went to meet him. Bixu recognized him as a vessel of great promise for the Daoist gate, yet considering his familial ties, he surmised that the Master might struggle to sever them in his heart. Thus, he sent him home, merely exhorting him to accumulate good deeds.\n\nUpon returning, the Master bid farewell to his relatives and friends, abandoning his wife and children to depart. His wife mocked him, but he merely smiled and paid no heed. When his father saw this and rebuked him, the Master gently explained the learning of life and destiny. His father then understood and, together with the Master, became a disciple at Bixu’s gate. With unkempt hair and tattered robes, the Master begged in the marketplace, and the people of the time called him \"Wine-Loving Master Li.\" In his daily life, he took the cultivation of the self and the benefit of others as his duty.\n\nIn the *gengwu* year of the *Da’an* era, a great drought struck the Qin region, and the starving lay strewn like grass. Relying on the wealth of Zhao Sanlang, a local magnate, the Master persuaded him with kind words. Zhao, awakened, then distributed his stored grain. The Master ordered his Dharma brothers, such as Qi Zhidao, to hull the grain and cook gruel to aid the poor and sick, continuing until autumn when the relief effort ceased.\n\nThereafter, he secluded himself in Huanju of Xingping for a thousand days, attaining great enlightenment. At that time, Jia Gu, the River and Canal Commissioner, invited him to preside over Longxiang Abbey south of the county. The Master accepted and resided there. After five years, he moved to Louguan, then later to Danxia in Jingzhao. Before long, Bixu tasked him with overseeing the construction of Bixu Abbey in Sanyuan.\n\nIn the *wuzǐ* year of the *Zhengda* era, Bixu entrusted the succession of the teaching to the Master before passing away. Shortly after, war broke out in Guanzhong, and the Master led his followers to take refuge in the Southern Mountains. By the spring of the *gengyín* year, he reached Nanyang and met Master Chongxu Li. Dongzhen Yu, hearing of this in Bianjing, dispatched a messenger with a letter, inviting the Master to reside at Danyang Abbey.\n\nIn the *guǐsì* year, Bianjing surrendered, and the city was left in ruins. The people scrambled to cross the river northward. The Master subsequently arrived in Jijun, where he secretly instructed and enlightened the ferrymen, establishing Lingxu and Tianqing Abbeys to aid the multitudes fleeing south. The following year, he traveled to Yan. At that time, Master Qinghe Yin presided over the teaching and entrusted the Master with reviving the ancestral sanctuary in Qin, appointing him as the Supervisor of Daoist Affairs for the Shaanxi Circuit.\n\nAt the outset of his journey, he smelted a measure of gold to fund the initial construction. Passing through Zhao and Wei, nobles and lords came to greet him beyond the city gates, and the wealth and gifts he received were beyond count. All were devoted to the restoration of the ancestral sanctuary. Tian Decan, the Chief Administrator of Jingzhao, along with his assisting officials, met him near Hezhong and offered him the Gude Abbey within the prefectural city as his residence.\n\nAt that time, Guanzhong had only recently been pacified, and violent grudges flared among the people. The area around Liu-Jiang was desolate, with no human traces. The Master led his followers to reclaim and rebuild, laying the foundation of their work. In the spring of the *xīnchǒu* year, during the funeral of the ancestral master, he made many plans and arrangements.\n\nIn the *rényín* year, the scholars of Qin proposed restoring the Confucian temple but lacked tiles. The Master provided all they needed, and the scholars were deeply impressed. In the spring of the *jiǎchén* year, Prince Kuoduan dispatched envoys to the abbey to perform a seven-day-and-night Golden Register Offering. Upon its completion, as per custom, the Master was bestowed the title \"Perfected One of Wondrous Truth of the No Desires Abbey.\"\n\nThat autumn, Hao Zang, the myriarch of Weibei, captured dozens of conspirators plotting to flee south. Upon uncovering their crimes, he intended to execute them all. The Master rode through the night to intercede, explaining the principles of sin and fortune, and all were spared. The following year, a small band of outlaws in Jingzhao secretly fled. The prefect, Han Yuan, proposed executing them in the marketplace to deter others. The Master, however, advised that only the ringleaders should be punished.\n\nWhen the mother of Yila Baojian, the Grand Tutor, died, he wished to bury two maidservants with her. The Master corrected this with the ancient rites of burial, and the practice was abolished. In the *bǐngwǔ* year, he journeyed to Yan and stayed beneath the Incense Hall. In the fourth month of summer, he returned, passing through Bianjing and lodging at Danyang Abbey. There, he suddenly appeared anxious. His disciples hurried out, and scarcely had they traveled a short distance when the Song army arrived at the city gates. Such was the nature of his foresight.\n\nIn the autumn of the following year, the empress bestowed upon him the honor of a cap and robe. In the spring of the *jiǎyín* year, Master Zhenchang Li, who presided over the teaching, summoned the Master with a letter regarding the Universal Offering. Though he was eighty-six, he dared not decline on account of his age. Upon arriving in Yan, his illness worsened. On the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month, he passed away peacefully in the Fanghu Chamber of Changchun Abbey. His disciples carried his coffin west and interred him in the Immortal’s Transcendence Garden of Liu-Jiang.\n\nThroughout his life, though he did not study books, the gentry and officials of all regions held him in great esteem. In Yan, he associated with Wanqing, Dan You, Zhao Furen, Jing Xuan, and Ding Chen. In Qin, he was close to Ziyang Yang Huan, Yao Zuoxia Shu, and Lai Xian, as well as Minister Ming’s Na Bangyong and others. They all composed elegies in verse, wrote memorial essays, and had them inscribed on stone in the Jingfu Hall of Youde Abbey. Reading them, one can glimpse the depth of his Daoist practice in his daily life.\n\n**Perfected One of Perfect Clarity**\nThe Master’s surname was Gao, his personal name Daokuan, and his courtesy name Yuzhi. His family was a prominent clan of Huairen County in Yingzhou. He was of imposing stature and magnanimous bearing. He was born on the nineteenth day of the seventh month in the *yǐmǎo* year of the *Mingchang* era.",

      "translated_text": "In his youth, he did not join other children in their boisterous play. As he grew older, he studied books and mastered the essentials of the classics and histories. His nature inclined toward elegance and simplicity, and he often harbored thoughts of transcending the mundane and withdrawing from the world. Yet with both parents still living, he could not fulfill his aspirations. When the wars of the *Da’an* era erupted, the clouds and winds of strife swept through his homeland, so he took his family to seek refuge in Chang’an, where he concealed himself as a petty clerk. After his parents passed away, he observed the mourning rites with full propriety.\n\nOne evening, he sat exposed in the courtyard. As midnight approached, he suddenly beheld a radiance as bright as day. Looking up to the northwest, he saw the gates of heaven swing wide open, and amidst crimson clouds and emerald mists, jade forests, gem-like trees, jeweled halls, and jasper terraces appeared before his eyes in vivid detail—only to vanish again in an instant. From that moment, his resolve to pursue the Dao grew ever more fervent.\n\nIn the *xīnsì* year of the *Xīngdìng* era, he heard that An Jun of Penglai Hermitage on Zhangtai Street was a Perfected One of the Quanzhen tradition. He immediately abandoned his home and worldly ties, becoming An Jun’s disciple. An Jun, admiring his determination, taught him that crushing arrogance, tempering aggression, and curbing desires to cultivate the mind were the foundations of self-cultivation. The Master reverently embraced these profound instructions, wearing tattered robes and subsisting on coarse fare, yet savoring the Dao and contemplating truth with serene contentment.\n\nWhen the *Zhèngdà* era began, he traveled to Bianliang and took refuge under Master Chongxu Li of Danyang Abbey, seeking to advance in the Dao. Chongxu set him to laborious tasks to accumulate merit and virtue. For years, the Master diligently performed the duties of tending the stove and drawing water without respite, until Chongxu imparted to him the essentials of the Dao.\n\nIn the *bǐngxū* year, the Jin ruler dispatched an imperial envoy to Fengxiang to summon Master Dongzhen Yu. He also commanded Li Chongxu to select a disciplined Daoist to accompany him. Chongxu summoned the Master and said: “The bond between master and disciple is ordained by hidden principle. Dongzhen is my friend beyond the world; he once received the true seal of approval from Masters Danyang and Changchun, and is a patriarch of the Mysterious Gate. Now the emperor has issued a summons, and you shall go with him. In the days to come, when our tradition flourishes, it will be through your efforts that the Dao is accomplished. This is the man—revere him well.” The Master received his instructions and departed.\n\nAfter Dongzhen arrived in Bian, he was appointed to oversee the Central Taiyi Abbey. The Master served under him, paying homage in the morning and seeking counsel in the evening, advancing in his study of the Dao, virtue, nature, and destiny. When Bianjing fell in the *guǐsì* year, the Master crossed north to the capital of Yan, then took up residence in Longyang Abbey in Dexing, nurturing his spirit and cultivating his vital force, as if intending to remain there for life.\n\nIn the spring of the *wùxū* year, Dongzhen summoned him back to Yan to expound the teachings at Bailiu. In the winter of the *gēngzǐ* year, he followed Dongzhen into the Pass to restore the ancestral sanctuary on Mount Zhongnan. During the preparations for the ancestral master’s interment, the Master contributed in many ways, aiding and supporting the endeavor.\n\nIn the *wùshēn* year, Dongzhen bestowed upon him the title *Yuanmingzi* and appointed him to administer Chongyang Wanshou Abbey and oversee the affairs of Ganhe Yuxian Abbey. Dongzhen told him: “People often believe that sitting in stillness and quieting the mind are the sole means of advancing in the Dao. Yet those who attain the highest understanding cultivate both stillness and activity, essence and function, in perfect harmony—remaining tranquil amid motion, finding serenity in disturbance, acting without acting, engaging in affairs without entanglement, blending with the world while preserving their inner light. This is the subtle essence of the Old Master’s teaching. Now that the Mysterious Transformation flourishes, you must uphold this principle, respond to circumstances to support the tradition, and benefit beings to lay the foundation for attaining the truth and realizing the Dao. In the future, you will bear great responsibility for our teaching. Though affairs may press upon you, do not shrink from them—all this will refine you for your ultimate accomplishment.” The Master knelt, bowed his head, and replied: “The immortal’s wondrous teachings are beyond the ken of ordinary mortals. Today, I receive your instruction and shall conduct myself accordingly.”\n\nFrom then on, he governed himself with frugality and treated others with generosity. Within a few years, all within and beyond the tradition, without exception, held him in affection. Those who recognized his worth marveled at Dongzhen’s discernment in choosing him.\n\nIn the spring of the *rénzǐ* year, Master Zhenchang Li, the presiding Perfected One, conducted rites at the ancestral sanctuary and appointed the Master as the Daoist Registrar of the Jingzhao Circuit. He served in this role for a decade, fulfilling his duties without fail.\n\nBy the *xīnyǒu* year of the *Zhōngtǒng* era, when Perfected One Chengming Zhang journeyed to the imperial court to secure an appointment, the Master was recommended and granted the title of *Tídian* (Supervisor) of Daoist Affairs for Shaanxi, Xingyuan, and other circuits, concurrently administering Chongyang Wanshou Abbey.\n\nIn the summer of the *wùchén* year of the *Zhìyuán* era, the imperial nephew Prince Yongchang bestowed upon him a golden crown and brocade robes. In the *xīnwèi* year, Perfected One Chunzhen Wang, the succeeding presiding master, conferred upon him the posthumous title *Zhīcháng Bàodé Yuánmíng Zūnshī* (Venerable Master of Constant Awareness, Embracing Virtue, and Perfect Clarity).\n\nShortly thereafter, Prince Yongchang again bestowed upon him the title *Dòngguān Pǔjì Yuánmíng Zhēnrén* (Perfected One of Perfect Clarity, Pervasive Salvation, and Penetrating Observation).\n\nIn the spring of the *guǐyǒu* year, the imperial son Prince Anxi established his headquarters at Liupan. Upon their first meeting, the Master’s responses pleased the prince, who then recommended and bestowed upon him a ceremonial cap and robes.\n\nIn the summer of the *yǐhài* year, the Master was summoned to the imperial encampment to conduct the grand *Jīnlù Luótiān* ritual. From the day the rites began until their conclusion, auspicious clouds swirled overhead, and numinous signs manifested clearly—all recorded in the *Tóulóngcè* stele composed by Minister Shang, and thus not repeated here.\n\nBefore long, the empress dowager also bestowed upon him ceremonial robes, along with gracious and generous decrees.\n\nIn the autumn of the *bǐngzǐ* year, Prince Anxi issued an imperial edict entrusting him with the administration of all Daoist affairs in western Shu.\n\nFor twenty years, the Master oversaw the teaching with a focus on virtue and transformation, never once resorting to punitive measures. At the ancestral sanctuary, he oversaw the construction of the Southern Prosperity Upper Abbey and the Great Hall of the Five Patriarchs, along with numerous renovations to kitchens, storehouses, and stables. Even when a single novice sought his counsel, he received them with courtesy, never displaying arrogance or self-satisfaction. Though his duties were onerous, he responded to every matter with discernment, aligning each with its proper principle.\n\nEach night, he would compose his spirit in quiet meditation until dawn, never sleeping—his practice of refining and nurturing the truth became his constant discipline. Thus, though he lived past eighty, he remained vigorous in step and full of vitality. From princes and nobles to common folk, none failed to treat him with exceptional reverence. As a result, the teaching remained serene and orderly, the community of Daoists at peace, and those who benefited in hidden ways from his influence were beyond count.",

His attendants urged him to take medicine, but the Master said: \"Life and death are like morning and evening—this is the constant principle of all things. How could medicine or stone prolong what is not mine by fate?\" By the twenty-fourth day, he ceased eating, yet sat upright all day, speaking as usual. He only instructed others with words on advancing in the Dao.
