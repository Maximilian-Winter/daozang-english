Together, they proceeded to the altar beneath the Mulberry Grove of Yang Valley, circumambulated the Dao thrice, and with unified hearts, bowed in reverence to address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.\n\nThe assembled declared: \"We observe that ordinary mortals fail to revere Heaven and Earth, defile the Three Luminaries, and pass before the Northern Dipper, committing manifold evil deeds. They deceive Heaven and betray Earth, recklessly indulging in folly. Some, consumed by greed and stinginess, refuse to practice generosity, slander the sagely and worthy, and thus have their names recorded in the Black Register. The youthful attendants of good and evil, along with the messengers of the Four Upright and Merit Officers, day and night submit reports to the Upper Primordial Heavenly Official at the Palace of Penetrating Numinosity and Primordial Yang. Consequently, they suffer years of misfortune, encountering calamities, ruin, and loss—wealth and grain dissipated, misfortunes unending, entanglements with officials and imprisonment without respite. Their livestock fails to thrive, fields and silkworms yield no harvest, their fortunes falter, and their endeavors fail.\n\nWe, by virtue of past causes, have in this life received blessings and, on this day, have been granted the vision of the Supreme Primordial Heavenly Worthy. We beseech You to dispel our ignorant delusions and bestow Your compassion. Should You deign to instruct us, it would be as though our decayed bones were revived, and we, having received Your nurturing grace, could never repay such boundless kindness.\"\n\nThereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Supreme Dao Lord, saying: \"The principles of misfortune you have described are indeed pitiable. To revive the deluded and guide them to the shore of blessings, you shall resume your seat and listen carefully to these decisive words.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy proclaimed: \"The wealth, nobility, clothing, food, official ranks, servants, cattle, horses, fields, silkworms, and progeny of human life are all rewards for having, in past lives, made offerings to the Three Worthies and surrendered one’s destiny to the One Hundred and Twenty Heavenly Worthies of the Upper Primordial. Those who commit evil and unwholesome deeds are born into poverty, lacking clothing and sustenance. Though they possess human form, their bodies are incomplete—some deaf, blind, mute, or dumb; others crippled, lame, or foolish. Some are harmed by snakes and tigers; others struck by celestial thunderbolts, consumed by wildfires, or afflicted by pestilence and miasmic diseases. Some perish by violence or imprisonment, their endeavors thwarted, their desires unfulfilled. They live in discord with their families, enduring years of misfortune, their paths to peace obstructed. This is because they created evil karma in past lives, and thus suffer these hardships in retribution for their former transgressions.\n\nIf they seek deliverance, they should seek out a lofty Daoist master, well-versed in the scriptures, such as the *Numinous Treasure’s Natural Canon*. For one, two, or three days and nights, they may burn incense, ascend the altar, submit memorials, perform the Dao at the six periods, and recite the names of the One Hundred and Twenty Heavenly Worthies of the Upper Primordial, repenting their transgressions to be freed from all suffering.\n\nLet each person reverently and wholeheartedly bow in homage to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Primordial’s Nine Qi.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Solemn Purity and Dharmic Power.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Responsive Might and Virtue.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Fearless Ascetic Conduct.\nThe Heavenly

and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Flowing Light and Universal Longevity.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Officials of the Upper Prime, the Perfected of the Upper Prime, and the hosts of flying immortals—across the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Great Canopy Heaven, and the Boundless Worlds—all beings, whether of the Dao or the laity, men and women, none failed to turn their hearts in reverence, extolling and praising the names of the Sixty Heavenly Worthies.\n\nAt that moment, all karmic retributions of life and death were extinguished. The Most High Lord of the Dao and all the sagely hosts, upon hearing this exposition, rejoiced beyond measure. They universally exhorted all beings to take refuge, repent, and confess.\n\nOn this very day, they entrusted their bodies, spirits, and lives to the Most High Boundless Dao and the Upper Prime’s Sixty Heavenly Worthies and Boundless Sagely Hosts, repenting for all transgressions from the time of receiving their natures until this day—offenses against the Upper Prime’s Heavenly Immortals, the sun, moon, and stars, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper, and all sins of collision and conflict in their comings and goings.\n\nOr perhaps they had committed sins of killing other living beings for sustenance and consumption; sins of refusing to bestow alms, only thinking of greed and stinginess, hoarding wealth and treasures; sins of consuming the blood and flesh of beings to nourish their own bodies and mouths; sins of flying hawks and coursing hounds, setting fires to burn and kill the insects, birds, and beasts of mountain forests; sins of seeing others in illness and distress yet failing to provide relief or medical care; sins of blocking vital roads and obstructing passage; sins of disrespecting the Three Treasures and betraying their masters to ruin the Dao; sins of slandering the winds, rains, thunder, and rains; sins of constantly harboring evil intentions, scheming to harm others’ lives and coveting their wealth and treasures; sins of stealing others’ wives, children, and servants; sins of stealing others’ sacred images, bells, chimes, banners, flowers, Dharma seats, ritual implements, and scriptures.\n\nAll such sins of the six senses and three karmic actions, countless and boundless, innumerable—all transgressions from this life and past lives—are now, on this day, sincerely confessed and repented, beseeching their complete eradication.\n\nWe prostrate and pray that the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Upper Prime, the Ten Upright Perfected, and the Heavenly Emperor’s Messengers will record these sins, transform them into meritorious deeds through this offering, and present them to the Heavenly Courts. May they, in the present and future, exempt us from great calamities, liberate us from the sources of suffering, and grant us all joys, while the hosts of immortals constantly bestow their protection.\n\nLet each person reverently and with utmost sincerity bow and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Perfection of the Upper Clarity.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and pay homage to

of Flying Transcendents.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning again addressed the Dao Lord, saying: Since the beginningless beginning, I have responded to the ten directions, stabilized and pacified the lands, taught and guided beings, and delivered all. If Daoist priests and nuns in sacred mountains and grottoes and palaces reverently recite and venerate the name of the Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Prime, they will deliver their ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, ascend to the heavens, attain perfection in body, and dwell in peace and freedom. If kings, emperors, governors, magistrates, officials, common folk, elders, and lay practitioners encounter any calamities or suffer from lingering illnesses, they should establish Daoist altars in temples, sacred platforms, or their homes, kindle lamps, burn incense, and diligently perform purification rites, taking refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Prime Who Responds to Conditions and the boundless holy host. All sins as numerous as the sands of the river and the dust of the earth will instantly vanish, and every illness will dissolve upon invocation. The nation will be stabilized, heaven’s eternal abiding ensured, the world will know great peace, all things will flourish, the people will rejoice in prosperity, disasters will not intrude, souls will ascend, and the Dao’s qi will mysteriously support them.\n\nThose who revere and honor thus—whether villagers, men or women, officials, or common folk—need only, within each year, on the Three Primes, Eight Assemblies, Four Seasons, Eight Festivals, Five La Days, and Ten Straight Days, burn incense, kindle lamps, perform purification rites, practice the Dao, express merit, and repent transgressions to receive vast blessings. As for the method of kindling lamps: in spring, kindle nine lamps, or ninety lamps, or nine hundred lamps; in summer, kindle three lamps, or thirty lamps, or three hundred lamps; in autumn, kindle seven lamps, or seventy lamps, or seven hundred lamps; in winter, kindle five lamps, or fifty lamps, or five hundred lamps. Following this ritual in accordance with the seasons and circulating qi, all will reach the celestial bureaus, and each will attain felicity and fortune. Whether in sacred mountains, divine altars, dwellings, prefectures, villages, riverbanks, or watersides—wherever such places may be—establish one-day, three-day, seven-day, or forty-nine-night rituals, kindling lamps, performing purification rites, and reverently reciting the sacred names. Wherever the people widely establish Daoist altars, repenting their transgressions, all will receive forgiveness, their sins will be wholly dissolved, and the merit will be immeasurable, beyond conception.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy and the host of immortals, having spoken this scripture, made obeisance and withdrew. Reverently upholding the teachings, with devoted hearts we bow our heads to the Most High, the Void Sovereign, the Orthodox and True Three Treasures.\n\n*Litany of the Most High Numinous Treasure, Upper Prime Heavenly Official for Dispelling Transgressions and Eradicating Sins* (conclusion)",

If Daoist priests and nuns in sacred mountains and grottoes and palaces reverently recite and venerate the name of the Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Prime, they will deliver their ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, ascend to the heavens, attain perfection in body, and dwell in peace and freedom. If kings, emperors, governors, magistrates, officials, common folk, elders, and lay practitioners encounter any calamities or suffer from lingering illnesses, they should establish Daoist altars in temples, sacred platforms, or their homes, kindle lamps, burn incense, and diligently perform purification rites, taking refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Prime Who Responds to Conditions and the boundless holy host.

The nation will be stabilized, heaven’s eternal abiding ensured, the world will know great peace, all things will flourish, the people will rejoice in prosperity, disasters will not intrude, souls will ascend, and the Dao’s qi will mysteriously support them.\n\nThose who revere and honor thus—whether villagers, men or women, officials, or common folk—need only, within each year, on the Three Primes, Eight Assemblies, Four Seasons, Eight Festivals, Five La Days, and Ten Straight Days, burn incense, kindle lamps, perform purification rites, practice the Dao, express merit, and repent transgressions to receive vast blessings. As for the method of kindling lamps: in spring, kindle nine lamps, or ninety lamps, or nine hundred lamps; in summer, kindle three lamps, or thirty lamps, or three hundred lamps; in autumn, kindle seven lamps, or seventy lamps, or seven hundred lamps; in winter, kindle five lamps, or fifty lamps, or five hundred lamps. Following this ritual in accordance with the seasons and circulating qi, all will reach the celestial bureaus, and each will attain felicity and fortune. Whether in sacred mountains, divine altars, dwellings, prefectures, villages, riverbanks, or watersides—wherever such places may be—establish one-day, three-day, seven-day, or forty-nine-night rituals, kindling lamps, performing purification rites, and reverently reciting the sacred names. Wherever the people widely establish Daoist altars, repenting their transgressions, all will receive forgiveness, their sins will be wholly dissolved, and the merit will be immeasurable, beyond conception.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy and the host of immortals, having spoken this scripture, made obeisance and withdrew.
