  "full_translation": "The *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n**Masters Section, Volume 14**\n*Annotated Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic*\n**Daoist School**\n**Abstract**\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully observe: The *Annotated Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic* in three juan was composed by Wang Dao of the Song dynasty. It is prefaced by the author’s own preface and a memorial from Zhou Zhenyi, a Daoist of the Taiyi Palace, submitting the work for imperial consideration, followed by a postscript by the author. Wang Dao’s origins remain unverifiable; he styled himself \"Bao Yi Lang, Acting Commander of the Prince of Enping’s Residence,\" and in his preface described himself as \"a mere military officer serving in the princely household.\" Thus, he was originally a palace guard of the princely establishment who later attached himself to the Daoist tradition.\n\nChen Zhensun’s *Bibliographic Notes with Explanations* records the *Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Upper Classic* in one juan, unattributed to any author. Wang Dao expanded upon its meaning with annotations and further elucidated his intent through supplementary explanations. The *Classic* is divided into thirty-three chapters: thirteen in the upper juan, six in the middle, and fourteen in the lower. At the end are appended two diagrams—*\"Gathering the Celestial Fire Phases\"* and *\"Gold and Fire Intermingling to Generate the Elixir\"*—to clarify the method of practice. The main annotations assert that true lead and true mercury are but the essence of Heaven and Earth and the radiance of the sun and moon, harmonized to emulate creation and refine the divine elixir. They distinguish the authenticity of medicinal ingredients and resolve the differences among minerals. The author also claims to have received the true oral instructions of a master, noting that the circulated versions of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* contained many errors, which he corrected by reorganizing the text into chapters and fixing the phrasing. During the Chunxi era, he submitted the work for imperial review, explaining that \"Dragon-Tiger\" signifies the meaning of water and fire—a conventional metaphor in Daoist alchemical texts.\n\nThe annotations and explanations frequently cite the *Cantong Qi*, for the discourse on furnace and fire originated with Wei Boyang, whose work remains the \"Six Classics\" of that tradition. Wang Dao also wrote a *Detailed Annotation of the Cantong Qi*, as mentioned in his postscript, though this work is now lost. Its general purport, however, was likely similar to the present text.\n\nThis book is not listed in the *Bibliographic Treatise* of the *History of the Song Dynasty*, leading some to suspect it was forged by Daoist practitioners. Yet, as the antiquity of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* itself remains unverified, there is little need to investigate the authenticity of the annotations. Moreover, the practices of breath cultivation and life nurturing belong to the reclusive traditions of mountain forests—why, then, would a court alchemist submit such a work to the throne? The man himself is hardly worthy of note; we preserve this text merely because its arguments are coherent.\n\nIn the third month of the forty-fourth year of the Qianlong reign, respectfully submitted after collation.\n\n**Chief Compilers:**\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collator:**\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n---\n\n**Original Preface to the *Annotated and Exegetical Commentary on the Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic***\n\nYour servant Dao states: The learning of the Daoist school encompasses what is called \"inner elixir\" and \"outer elixir,\" which are truly bound to the essence of life and destiny. Those who attain them achieve, in small measure, the preservation of vitality and extension of years, and in great measure, transcendence into immortality and sagehood. Their disciples have transmitted writings to the world, numbering no fewer than ten thousand scrolls. For the inner elixir, none fail to take spirit and qi as their foundation; for the outer elixir, none fail to take lead and mercury as their origin. An ancient song says:\n\n*Red lead, black mercury—head of the great elixir,*\n*When matched in harmony, true cultivation begins.*\n*Red lead draws essence, black draws marrow;*\n*Resolve this duality, and the medicine is peerless.*\n*Merge red into black to preserve long life;*\n*Use black in red, and you ascend as a celestial immortal.*\n*Inverted, these two form the elixir—*\n*Fire and dragon transform into celestial immortals.*\n\nThis is the essential method of the outer elixir.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, those who study the Dao have all regarded lead and mercury as the great elixir medicine, yet they know not what true lead and true mercury truly are. Since my youth, I have delighted in hearing of such matters, collecting alchemical texts and pondering their meaning day and night, even forgetting sleep and food. Yet these were but words on paper, never elucidated. In the *ren-shen* year of the Shaoxing reign, a Daoist told me that true lead was but the silver ore mined from mountains and stones, and true mercury was the liquid quicksilver extracted from cinnabar. He instructed me to obtain about a catty of each, refine them in a crucible with fire, and await the result. I believed him and thus established a laboratory in the Tianqing Abbey of Guiji, following his instructions to test the method. Years passed, wealth was expended, yet no success was achieved—not because my heart lacked sincerity, but because the method itself was flawed.\n\nIn the *jia-shen* year of the Qiandao reign, another Daoist told me that true lead does not reveal its form, and true mercury does not manifest its shape. He further said: \"True lead is not silver, true cinnabar is not mercury. Combine these two, divide them into nine portions, and refine them in a tripod with fire to obtain the *Yellow Sprout*. When refined by method, it transforms into *Yellow Chariot* and *Purple Powder*, also called *Dust of the Bright Window*. Ingesting it gathers essence, collects spirit, and eradicates all illness.\" In my view, this was merely the *Central Elixir* once concocted by Qingxiazi. Not until the *gui-si* year of the Chunxi reign did I encounter a true master, who enabled me to realize that all I had previously obtained was not true lead or true mercury.\n\nAn ancient song says:\n\n*True lead is not born within the five metals,*\n*It arises in the profound depths before heaven and earth.*\n*Another says:*\n*The sage seizes the intent of creation,*\n*Hand-gripping sun and moon, placing them in the crucible.*\n*Gently, the essence of heaven and earth ascends;*\n*Gathered, yin and yang converge—*\n*Spirit and demon, sun’s soul and moon’s spirit.*\n*Whoever recognizes this is a true immortal.*\n*Refine and ingest it for over a thousand days,*\n*And the body, free of yin, cannot die.*\n\nThe true master transmitted to me his secret formula and oral instructions, and in that moment, I awakened as from a dream. Thereafter, I read the books of all schools, and none failed to align; all became clear and luminous. From this, I knew that the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit are true lead and true mercury—arising from formlessness to generate numinous substance. The movement and stillness of the myriad things all proceed from them. If one establishes the crucible, erects the tripod, constructs the divine chamber, and harmonizes the root of sun and moon, mastering the transformations of water and fire without losing the celestial tally, then the great medicine and divine elixir may be obtained.\n\nOver thirty years, I encountered three teachers, and only with the true master did I finally grasp the wondrous Dao. Your servant is but a lowly military officer, serving in a princely household, with meager salary and humble means. I could not gather true companions, procure elixir materials, cast crucibles, construct the divine chamber, or retreat to the mountains and forests to pursue this path. Yet I have focused my heart and will, never forgetting it day or night. Recently, during a moment of leisure, I examined the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* as it circulates in the world and found its errors to be numerous. Thus, I employed what I received from the true master to correct and refine it, dividing it into chapters and verses, composing annotations. I further used the *Cantong Qi* of Wei Boyang to verify its meaning, expanding it into an exegesis to distinguish the authenticity of medicinal materials, the differences among metals and minerals, and to eliminate redundancy while extracting essentials, ensuring coherence from beginning to end. I compiled it into one work of three scrolls: the first scroll contains thirteen chapters, the second six, and the third fourteen, totaling thirty-three chapters. I dare not transmit this to later generations but merely present it to fellow Daoist friends of like aspiration.\n\nYour servant, a man of rustic remoteness, knows no taboos. With reckless audacity and a thousand deaths’ worth of trepidation, I have, through the verification of the eminent scholar Zhou Zhenyi, transcribed and respectfully submitted this work. I humbly pray that in Your Majesty’s moments of leisure, You might deign to peruse it, granting me the once-in-a-millennium fortune of fulfilling my lifelong aspiration. This is not merely my private wish but also the entrusted charge of the true master.\n\nWritten on the first day of the fourth month in the fourteenth year of the Chunxi reign.\n\nYour servant, the *Baoyi* Lang, Wang Dao, with utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground a hundred times and respectfully presents this preface.\n\n---\n\n**Original Preface to the *Annotated and Exegetical Commentary on the Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic***\n\n**Memorial Submitting the *Annotated and Exegetical Commentary on the Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic***\n\nYour servant Zhenyi respectfully observes: The *Annotated and Exegetical Commentary on the Dragon-Tiger Classic* in three scrolls, composed by the *Baoyi* Lang Wang Dao, presents matters with clarity and directness, elucidates principles with depth and detail, and profoundly captures the esoteric meaning of the *Cantong Qi* and *Jinbi Jing*. Its teachings on the outer elixir reject the use of the five metals, eight stones, and various miscellaneous minerals as medicinal materials, instead taking the essence of heaven and earth and the radiance of sun and moon, blending them with the transformations of creation to form the divine elixir. This aligns with the words of the Yin Zhenren: \"From formlessness, form is generated—this is the returning elixir.\" The phrases \"ordinary lead and ordinary mercury require no manipulation\" are entirely consistent with what I have learned.\n\nThough this humble mountain-dwelling Daoist’s study of the Dao is shallow and offers little of value, I have long been versed in the discourse of Daoist texts. An ancient saying goes: \"Three broken arms make a good physician.\" I have known Wang Dao for a long time, and our discussions have been thorough. When he brought his composition to me for verification, it matched in its entirety what I received from my master. Thus, I dare not conceal it but, with trepidation, have transcribed and respectfully submitted it. I humbly hope that in Your Majesty’s moments of leisure, You might glance upon it. From this day forward, I pray that the Imperial Pharmacy be instructed to reject all medicines composed of metals, stones, and miscellaneous minerals, preventing their use by Your Majesty, thereby safeguarding eternal longevity—a great fortune for the realm.\n\nYour servant offers this humble and sincere loyalty, presumptuously encroaching upon Your Majesty’s grace. I humbly beseech Your indulgence, trembling before the awe of Heaven’s might. The depth of my servant’s trepidation is boundless.\n\nMemorial submitted by your servant, Zhou Zhenyi, Daoist of the Yangsu Hermitage in the Taiyi Palace.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial Submitting the *Annotated and Exegetical Commentary on the Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic***\n\n*Imperially Commissioned* *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n\n**Annotated and Exegetical Commentary on the Ancient Text of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*, Volume One**\n*By Wang Dao of the Song Dynasty*\n\n**The Divine Chamber: The Pivotal Stanza of the Elixir (Chapter One)**\n\nThe Divine Chamber is the pivot of the elixir, the parent of all minerals, where cinnabar and mercury dwell apart.\n\n*Your servant Dao annotates:*\nThe Divine Chamber is the pivot of the elixir. It mirrors Heaven and Earth, gathering the essence and qi of the sun and moon to form the divine elixir of golden liquid—hence it is called the pivot of the elixir. The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* states: *\"Heaven and Earth are the gates of the Changes.\"* Such is the meaning. As the parent of all minerals: true lead arises prior to Heaven and Earth, serving as the father of the myriad things and the mother of the hundred spirits—hence it is called the parent of all minerals. The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* states: *\"They are the parents of all hexagrams.\"* Such is the meaning. As for cinnabar and mercury dwelling apart: cinnabar and mercury originally possess no form or substance; they are concealed within true lead. Only when they obtain the pure essence of the Great Yang can they manifest and transform within the Divine Chamber—hence they are said to dwell apart.\n\n*Your servant Dao exegetes:*\nAt the inception of the Great Ultimate, primordial qi transformed into Heaven and Earth, dividing into yin and yang to become the sun and moon. From these, humanity and all things were produced, forming the Three Powers. Among them, humans are the most numinous, thus the foremost of the myriad things. In high antiquity, humans dwelled in the world, their lifespans often spanning hundreds or thousands of years. Yet after the Yellow Emperor, lifespans gradually became uneven, with some long and others short. Why is this? It is because humans failed to embody the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth in their conduct, leading to premature harm. Heaven and Earth endure so long because they fully possess the greatness of pure primordial qi, enabling them to follow the four seasons, regulate the five phases, and move in accordance with nature.\n\nThe sages of antiquity, comprehending the Dao of Heaven and grasping its workings, harmonized with the primordial qi of nature to nourish their bodies, thereby attaining lifespans akin to Heaven and Earth. Later generations, however, were otherwise: the young, whose blood and qi had yet to mature, were led astray by lust; the old, whose blood and qi were waning, were beset by decline and illness. Even those who came to understand the Dao did so too late, though those who preserved themselves could still prolong their years. Thus, the perfected emulate Heaven and Earth’s transformations, establishing the furnace and tripod to concoct the divine medicine. The aged who ingest it gather essence and guard spirit, returning to youth; the young who ingest it attain immortality all the more swiftly. Therefore, Master Zhenyi states: *\"The cultivation of the divine elixir shares the same path as the creation of Heaven and Earth.\"* When expressed through the imagery of the *Changes*, none do not first gather the root of Heaven and Earth as the foundation of the Great Elixir. They take the movements of Heaven and Earth as the model for the Great Elixir, employing Kan and Li to enact water and fire, traversing Mao and You to govern punishment and virtue, stealing the numerical shifts of the four seasons, and returning them to the palm of the hand. They entrust the mechanisms of yin and yang’s movement and stillness to complete the winter and summer, the yin generation of *Chunhuo*, and the yang effusion of *Xuanxiao*. When in motion, Kun’s lower line transforms into the first nine; when at rest, Qian’s lower line reverts to the first six. These are all the great principles of elixir cultivation.\n\n**Exiting Yang and Entering Yin (Chapter Two)**\n\nExiting yang and entering yin, their radiance flows to the two directions; the numerical array is three, aligned with the symbols of water and fire.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Annotation States:**\n\n\"Exiting yang and entering yin, their radiance flows to the two directions\" means yang arises from *zi* and emerges above the earth, traversing *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, and *chen* until it reaches *si*, where yang reaches its apex—thus the Azure Dragon, essence of the sun, shines in the east. Yin descends from *wu* and enters the earth, passing through *wei*, *shen*, *you*, and *xu* until it reaches *hai*, where yin reaches its extreme—thus the White Tiger, splendor of the moon, gleams in the west.\n\n\"Numerical array is three, aligned with the symbols of water and fire\" means the two entities, Azure Dragon and White Tiger, are both formed by the steaming *qi* of the Vermilion Bird, hence the three agents.\n\nThe Great Elixir, from its inception to completion, relies solely on the two symbols of water and fire beyond the divine chamber of true lead—no other substances are intermixed.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Exegesis States:**\n\nIn refining the divine elixir of golden liquid, one must first recognize the root origin of the medicinal substances, then verify the advancing and retreating of the firing times. Yang ascends and yin descends, never departing from the *zi* and *wu* directions; the sun’s passage and moon’s return must reside in the *mao* and *you* positions. Employing *Kan* and *Li* to enact water and fire, the Dragon and Tiger transform into husband and wife, returning the sun’s essence to the moon’s cavern. Thus, within lead, cinnabar is produced; when the Vermilion Bird sports in the *Li* palace, mercury arises from cinnabar. Gold arises from *qing* (emotion), mercury from *xing* (nature). When *qing* and *xing* embrace, husband and wife unite, and the golden liquid forms naturally.\n\nThus, human *qing* and *xing* do not depart from the body, just as the elixir’s cinnabar and mercury both arise within lead. *Qing* and *xing* in humans are not external things, nor are cinnabar and mercury separate from lead. Know then that the sun’s ascent and moon’s descent, yin and yang’s alternation, all occur within Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the essence and marrow of *Qian* and *Kun* constantly gather within the *Qifang* of Cock’s Foot Mountain, becoming the ancestral root of the great medicine and the fundamental stem of the golden elixir.\n\nThe sun has three illuminations, the moon three shifts. When the sun emerges in the east and its radiance shines in the west, the true *qi* of the west’s White Tiger, Metal virtue, enters the *Qifang* and transforms into the six *wu*. When the sun sets in the west and its radiance shines in the east, the true *qi* of the east’s Azure Dragon, Wood virtue, enters the *Qifang* and transforms into the six *si*. When the sun and moon align at *wu* and their radiance shines in the north, the true *qi* of the south’s Vermilion Bird, Fire virtue, enters the *Qifang*, coalesces with earth, and takes form as black lead, ever abiding within the *Yaofang*—the root of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things.\n\nThus, Master Wei said: \"The sun conceals its virtue and sinks its brilliance; the moon bestows its virtue and spreads its light. The sun, receiving the moon’s transformation, does not suffer harm.\" Know then that the true primordial *qi* is the root of Heaven’s and Earth’s generation.\n\nThe ancient perfected ones, recognizing that divine substances concealed themselves therein, borrowed their symbolic forms to gather them as the parents of the medicine. They modeled the divine chamber after *Qian* and *Kun*, established the tripod’s legs to symbolize Cock’s Foot, and took the tally of fire as the standard for the four seasons. Returning metal and water to their natural state, they revolved the yang fire to restore the sun’s essence and turned the yin tally to summon the moon’s spirit. Thus, the true *qi* of the three directions converged within the golden crucible, and the supreme harmony of the four symbols congealed within the *Yaofang*. Intermingling in primordial chaos, they were refined within the *Yin’e* until the elixir was complete—all following the transformations of nature.\n\nNowadays, scholars claim that common mercury can become the golden elixir, and common black lead can serve as the river chariot, leading later generations into delusion, mistaking the false for the real. They devise countless methods, yet grow old without success. Mercury emerges from cinnabar through fire’s transformation, but in principle, it is merely mercury and can never become the golden liquid.\n\nLittle do they know that the golden liquid is endowed with Heaven and Earth’s natural *qi*, relying on the pure essence of yin and yang. Yin attaches to the moon as its ruler, its body concealed and nurturing within, corresponding to *wu* and *si* as the parents of the supreme medicine. How could common mercury or the five metals, eight stones, and minerals of mountains and marshes compare to the divine medicine’s mother?\n\nThe divine medicine is the treasure for transcending the world and extending life, the ancestor of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad spirits. Yet it is exceedingly difficult for people to recognize. Later learners, using various miscellaneous substances to concoct the golden liquid, fundamentally misunderstand the ancients’ intent. If miscellaneous substances could produce the golden elixir, it would be easily attained. What the ancients called \"lead\" and \"mercury\" were direct references to symbolic forms; later generations, failing to grasp their meaning, took cinnabar as lead and mercury as mercury—thus confusing the root with false substances, leading to a thousand failures and ten thousand defeats, never achieving success.\n\nThe true lead’s production, as discussed earlier, is entirely based on scriptural excerpts and aligns with the master’s teachings—this is not reckless speculation to mislead later learners. Those who love the Dao should take heed.\n\n**Regulation by the King (Chapter Three)**\n\nRegulation by the king employs martial force to suppress rebellion and civil governance to pacify. Earth flourishes in the four seasons; its virtue reigns supreme. Grasping the sword and sheathing the halberd, it subdues the four directions.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Annotation States:**\n\n\"Regulation by the king employs martial force to suppress rebellion and civil governance to pacify\" refers to the issuance of decrees—just as a king dispatches edicts to the four directions. Martial force is the fierce fire-phase; civil governance, the gentle fire-phase. This is likened to the firm preparation of the golden crucible and the secure sealing of the spirit-chamber. At the outset, a yielding and compliant fire is applied to draw in the yang harmonizing *qi*, causing it to reside within the crucible-chamber. Later, a fierce fire is employed, and the golden liquid, on the verge of bursting forth, is restrained by the Kun Palace, thus retaining its essence within to complete the transformation. This is akin to a kingdom beset by rebellious subjects, yet through the king’s skillful regulation, they reform their hearts and obey commands, unable to escape.\n\n\"Earth flourishes in the four seasons; its virtue reigns supreme\" refers to the true earth of *wu* and *ji*. True earth is true lead. True lead can summon the utmost harmonizing *qi* to the Central Palace, so that the *qi* of the Four Symbols—Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior—cannot coalesce into golden liquid without true earth. Earth resides in the Central Palace, hence it is called the Yellow Emperor. Harmonizing *qi* follows the four seasons to generate the myriad things, all of which possess it. The spirit-chamber is the master of harmonizing *qi*, flourishing in the four seasons, able to gather the essence of the sun and moon into the crucible, preventing its dispersion outward. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving through beginning and end.\"\n\n**Minister Dao’s Exegesis States:**\n\nThe king governs the realm: internally cultivating civil virtue, externally maintaining martial readiness, modeling after the Three Sovereigns to establish the hundred officials, and following the four seasons to sow the five grains. Thus, the kingdom attains peace and harmony, and harmonizing *qi* arises. The ancients applied the principles of governing the realm to the regulation of golden liquid and divine elixir. At the initial stage, the spirit-chamber must be established. Within the spirit-chamber lies the embryo; beyond the embryo, the golden crucible; and beyond the crucible, the furnace. When all is fully prepared, the essence of the golden liquid is generated, and the utmost harmonizing *qi* converges. The king embodies the Central Palace’s spirit-steed, able to subdue the flowing pearl and prevent its flight. The civil fire is the fire of generation; the martial fire, the fire of consolidation. Together, they enable the golden liquid to reach completion.\n\nIn ancient times, after Lord Gongsun ascended, he was matched with the virtue of the Central Earth. Harmonizing *qi* arises from the center, further enveloped by the four seasons, binding metal and water in harmony. The flowing pearl gradually coalesces into divine medicine. The maiden’s flowing pearl, a volatile substance without fixed abode, can only be regulated by earth, returning it to the natural course of transformation.\n\n**Kan-Li Numbers One and Two (Chapter Four)**\n\nKan-Li numbers one and two: south and north alone form the warp, hence they crown the seventy-two minerals.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Annotation States:**\n\n\"Kan-Li numbers one and two\": Heaven generates water in Kan, hence the number one governs it; Earth generates fire in Li, hence the number two governs it. \"South and north alone form the warp\": The north is the extreme of yin, where yang *qi* begins, passing through *zi*, *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, *chen*, and *si* to reach its end. The south is the extreme of yang, where yin *qi* begins, passing through *wu*, *wei*, *shen*, *you*, *xu*, and *hai* to reach its end. Both yin and yang *qi* originate and conclude at *zi* and *wu*, hence south and north alone form the warp. \"Hence they crown the seventy-two minerals\": True lead is born of precelestial *qi* and takes form in the postcelestial realm, thus it is the chief among all things and the root of the returning elixir.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Exegesis States:**\n\nAmong the arts of humanity, none are deemed more wondrous than the transmutation of metals into gold and silver, regarded as worldly treasures. Yet, of those who practice such arts, ten thousand fail for every one who succeeds. Even if success is achieved, it is not a treasure that transcends the world, nor an art that extends life or benefits the realm. Today’s Dao-seekers do not prioritize essence and life, instead blindly following one another, never attaining enlightenment. They remain unaware that the Great Elixir’s path lies entirely in the mutual necessity of yin and yang *qi* to form the supreme medicine. As the *True Person’s Cinnabar Formula* states: \"Refining the treasure unites with the utmost subtlety; refining subtlety unites with the utmost numinosity; refining numinosity unites with the utmost spirit; refining spirit unites with the Dao.\" Such profound words reveal the authenticity or falsity of the golden elixir and the depth or shallowness of its wondrous principles. Without encountering a perfected one’s secret instructions, how can one comprehend the true essence and become a transcendent being?\n\nThe *Kan* and *Li* trigrams represent *Li* fire and *Kan* water. The south and north positions are the roots of water and fire. Though divided into two forms, they originate from a single source. Once separated, each embodies its own nature, becoming one in essence and two in manifestation. The perfected one, recognizing this as the natural disposition of heaven, does not rely on artificial combination. Instead, the two symbols are united as one, refined into the supreme treasure. When ingested, it bestows longevity. These two celestial products, free from impurities, are the essence of the sun and moon, the marrow of heaven and earth. As the *Yijing* states: \"Heaven displays its images; the sage emulates them.\" This is returning to the root and reverting to the origin, moving from deliberate action to merge with effortless spontaneity.\n\nThus, water and fire, *Kan* and *Li*, ascending and descending between south and north, alone head the seventy-two minerals as the foundation of the elixir. By grasping the mechanism of heaven’s generation and destruction and the cycle of the sun and moon, the nature of being and non-being becomes self-evident.\n\n**Hard and Soft, Exterior and Interior (Chapter Five)**\n\nHard and soft possess exterior and interior; yin and yang are endowed by nature. Metal and fire serve their proper functions; metal and water mutually contain one another. Male and female unite as one body, their application ordered and systematic.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Annotation States:**\n\n\"Hard and soft possess exterior and interior; yin and yang are endowed by nature\": *Qian* yang is hard; *Kun* yin is soft. They envelop one another, uniting within the spirit-chamber, allowing the natural *qi* of yin and yang and the essence of the sun and moon to converge upon the golden embryo and coalesce into divine medicine. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"*Qian* hard and *Kun* soft unite and envelop one another.\"\n\n\"Metal and fire serve their proper functions; metal and water mutually contain one another\": Externally, water and fire are frequently applied; internally, metal and water constantly interact. Watery mercury generates the body of the Green Dragon; metallic essence nurtures the embryo of the White Tiger. As the sprouts gradually manifest, metal and water take form within the spirit-chamber. After prolonged interaction of metal and fire, spirit-water is born within the mother’s womb, and the elixir is completed. Mother and child yearn for one another, and metal and water naturally nourish.\n\n\"Male and female unite as one body, their application ordered and systematic\": Male and female are also the Dragon and Tiger, *Qian* and *Kun*, the sun and moon, yin and yang, *Kan* and *Li*, husband and wife, water and fire. When male and female intermingle, their essence transforms into beings. If their application follows principle, generation occurs naturally.\n\nThe Minister of the Dao comments: The male pertains to the *Li* trigram, the image of the great yang and the sun; the female pertains to the *Kan* trigram, the image of the great yin and the moon. When sun and moon conjoin, metal and water naturally arise, and their natures harmonize in mutual affinity—no external substance is involved. If one forcibly combines them with杂物, the divine medicine will not possess its natural essence. Just as a young man reaching twenty and a maiden coming of age at fifteen yearn for each other, this too is a matter of natural spontaneity. The ancients used this analogy for the great elixir, which is no different from human procreation—both arise from natural essence. Cinnabar and mercury reside within lead’s body, emerging through the stimulation of water and fire, yet they are not external substances. The infant in the mother’s womb likewise arises from water and fire and is not an external substance. The ancients, understanding that these two kinds of essence and nature share the same fundamental root, thus guided the union of Dragon and Tiger’s essence to return and restore the qi of metal and water, naturally forming the supreme medicine. This is what is meant by \"the Dao of one yin and one yang.\" Without natural spontaneity, union cannot occur.\n\nFor example, when the two essences of male and female merge in bodily union, the sun’s departure and the moon’s arrival bring about natural transformation—how could external substances be required to conceive a child? This clarifies that the divine medicine must be formed from the *Li* fire and *Kan* water, not from杂物. From this, we know that the true essence of the sun and moon, refined into golden liquid, shares the same principle as human conception, differing only in whether one attains immortality or remains mortal, purity or impurity. The perfected ones, fearing that later learners might fail to grasp the true principle, thus use this analogy as proof. The remaining symbolic correspondences can be understood accordingly.\n\n**Chapter Six: Transformations Already Mysterious**\n\nTransformations already mysterious,\nIn the end, they return to renew the beginning.\nThe ninth day sets the measure;\nYang harmony aligns with dawn and dusk.\nThe cycle completes, matching Heaven’s heart.\nYang lines culminate at *si*;\nTrue yin emerges from *wu*,\nFrom *ding* to *hai* it concludes.\n\nThe Minister of the Dao annotates: \"Transformations already mysterious, in the end, they return to renew the beginning\" means that in refining the great elixir, completion should occur within one month. If the fire timing is imprecise or the crucible is not sealed, the spirit-essence descends minimally, and the golden liquid coagulates slowly, requiring another month. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When the *jiwei* day arrives at dusk, the end returns to renew the beginning.\"\n\n\"The ninth day sets the measure; yang harmony aligns with dawn and dusk\": At the night of the new moon, when the *zi* hour arrives and yang fire is about to rise, this is called the *Fuxi* hexagram, with the yang line emerging at the initial position of *Kun*. From *zi* to *si* is morning and day; from *wu* to *hai* is evening and night. Morning is governed by the *Zhun* hexagram, and evening by the *Meng* hexagram. The *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams govern the twelve hours of a day, forming the symbolic structure of the great elixir. One day is governed by two hexagrams, and one month by sixty hexagrams. Initially, it is *Zhun* and *Meng*; finally, it is *Jiwei*. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The celestial stems set the measure; movement and stillness have morning and evening.\"\n\n\"Matching Heaven’s heart, yang lines culminate at *si*\": Yang fire ascends from *zi* to *si*, where yang reaches its peak and yin arises at *wu*. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"In spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*.\"\n\n\"True yin emerges from *wu*, from *ding* to *hai* it concludes\": Yin符 descends from *wu* to *hai*, where yin reaches its peak and yang fire is reborn at *zi*. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"In autumn and winter, act externally, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*.\"\n\nThe Minister of the Dao comments: The Dao of the great elixir’s transformations begins with the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams. Yang fire arises at *zi*, and yin is born at *wu*. Yang reaches its peak at *si*, and yin culminates at *hai*. The twelve lines of *Qian* and *Kun* transform with the twelve hours to produce the golden liquid. Some who attempt the great elixir treat it as a trivial matter, recklessly proceeding, wasting wealth, emaciating their bodies, and exhausting their bones, yet never achieving success. How could they know that the supreme Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, inhales and exhales yin and yang, revolves the four seasons, steers the sun and moon, manifests the five phases, and cycles day and night to give birth to the myriad things—all governed by the transformations of the supreme Dao?\n\nThe perfected ones, understanding the root of the great Dao, can transcend the world. They emulate Heaven and Earth, gather yin and yang, collect the sun and moon’s ethereal souls, and merge the spirit-qi of water and fire to refine the supreme medicine, returning it to spontaneity. Though a thousand scriptures and ten thousand discourses have been left to guide future learners, those who study the Dao still fail to believe. They merely use tangible, material substances to imitate creation, never aligning with the supreme principle. Even if they achieve some success, they cannot restore youth, prolong life, or enable longevity. Instead, they may suffer boils, toxins, and hemorrhages. Those who refine the elixir—can they not be cautious?\n\n**Chapter Seven: Water and Fire Each in Their Place**\n\nWater and fire each in their place,\nHolding their boundaries to form cold and heat.\nEast and west mark benevolence and righteousness;\nThe five phases transform the four seasons.\nThus yin and yang interact,\nFollowing the Three-in-One to attain principle.\n\nThe Minister of the Dao annotates: \"Water and fire each in their place, holding their boundaries to form cold and heat\": Water is yin, reaching its coldest at *Kan*; fire is yang, reaching its hottest at *Li*. Each holds its place to form winter and summer. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; dawn and dusk follow cold and heat.\"\n\n\"East and west mark benevolence and righteousness; the five phases transform the four seasons\": The east pertains to wood, the source of all things’ growth, hence called benevolence and joy. The west pertains to metal, the agent of all things’ withering, hence called righteousness and anger. The qi of the five phases—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—transform to regulate the four seasons. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The hexagram lines contain benevolence and righteousness, manifesting joy and anger in due time.\"\n\n\"Thus yin and yang interact, following the Three-in-One to attain principle\": If the numbers of the four images do not lose their timing, the qi of yin and yang will follow water and fire, cold and heat, each attaining its principle.\n\nThe Minister of the Dao comments: The sun and moon move in their courses, and cold and heat follow their seasons. As the sun departs, the moon arrives; as the year shifts, the seasons turn. The qi of a year is compressed into a single day’s twelve hours, arranging spring, summer, autumn, and winter to correspond with the four seasons’ phases. Movement and symbolic correspondences must align with timing. If the sun and moon’s measures do not err and the cold and heat’s seasons are precise, the great elixir will surely be achieved.\n\nWhen the symbolic movements stir internally, one can foreknow the future: essence-qi is born within the chamber, and yin and yang conjoin within the crucible. Once yin and yang’s essence-qi are obtained, the crucible’s interior becomes moist and naturally flows, gradually generating transformations that correspond with the four seasons’ phases. Thus, Chapter Five states: \"Spring warms with benevolence; summer heats with propriety; autumn cools with righteousness; winter chills with wisdom.\" If the four seasons’ qi are harmonious, the year’s affairs will be accomplished.\n\nMoreover, the spring qi is the root of all living things, corresponding to the yang fire phase before noon; the autumn qi is the root of all withering things, corresponding to the yin tally phase after noon. Within the twelve double-hours, *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* belong to spring; *mao*, *chen*, and *si* to summer; *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* to autumn; *you*, *xu*, and *hai* to winter. When the fire phases are circulated through the twelve double-hours in accord with the four seasons and the Five Agents, not deviating by even a hair’s breadth, the crucible’s interior will gradually congeal into liquid gold, and the elixir will surely form.\n\nThus the song states:\n*The sage seizes the intent of Creation’s work,*\n*Rolling sun and moon in hand, placing them within the furnace.*\n*Gently stirring, inverting heaven and earth’s essence,*\n*Gathering yin and yang, the gods and spirits flee—*\n*Then one knows the liquid gold and divine elixir.*\nWere it not for the Dao’s symbolic correspondences aligning with heaven and earth, and the natural transformations of yin and yang, there would be no accomplishment.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Establishing the Chamber’s Position**\n\nEstablishing the chamber’s position—transformation lies within it. The *shen-shi* (spirit-chamber) is the upper and lower crucibles. *Establishing the position* means arranging the intimate union of the feminine and masculine. *Transformation* refers to cinnabar and mercury—these are the two functions of metal and earth. The two functions have no fixed hexagram positions; they spread their wings, soaring through *xu* and *wei*. Their coming and going are not constant, their above and below have no permanence. Dwelling alone, they do not alter, but return to the Central Palace—without earth, they cannot be controlled.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* annotates: *\"Establishing the chamber’s position—transformation lies within it\"* means erecting the spirit-chamber to model heaven and earth. Once heaven and earth are positioned, the radiance of sun and moon shines within them. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Heaven and earth establish their positions, the Changes move within them\"*—this is the meaning. The *shen-shi* is the upper and lower crucibles, corresponding to heaven and earth. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Heaven and earth are Qian and Kun\"*—this is the meaning. *Establishing the position* means arranging the intimate union of the feminine and masculine. Setting up the positions of heaven and earth, Qian and Kun: the upper crucible models heaven, the masculine, and Qian; the lower crucible models earth, the feminine, and Kun. Thus, the upper and lower crucibles, in the union of feminine and masculine, become one. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Establishing the position means arranging the union of yin and yang\"*—this is the meaning.\n\n*Transformation* refers to cinnabar and mercury—these are the two functions of metal and earth. When the crucible is established according to the method of Qian and Kun, the Metal Mother resides in the center, and the Three Powers are complete, giving birth to living mercury. Cinnabar and mercury are the water and fire of Kan and Li, the two functions of Qian and Kun. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"The Changes call Kan and Li the two functions of Qian and Kun\"*—this is the meaning. The *two functions without fixed hexagram positions, spreading their wings, soaring through xu and wei* refer to Qian and Kun, the sun and moon. The sun and moon’s ascent and descent, the extraction and addition of water and fire, are not bound to hexagram positions. *Zhang* and *yi* are the position of Li fire in the south; *xu* and *wei* are the position of Kan water in the north. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"The two functions have no fixed positions, circulating through the six voids\"*—this is the meaning. *Their coming and going are not constant, their above and below have no permanence* means that water and fire come and go within the spirit-chamber, not fixed in one place. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Their coming and going are not constant, their above and below have no permanence\"*—this is the meaning. *Dwelling alone, they do not alter, but return to the Central Palace* means that if the fire’s extraction and addition follow principle, they will constantly transform and enter the Central Palace as liquid gold. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Hidden and submerged, they transform within the center\"*—this is the meaning. *Without earth, they cannot be controlled; earth envelops all stones as the ancestor of the elixir* means that the Central Palace’s spirit-chamber, refined with true lead, is called the virtue of earth. It envelops the ten thousand things as the ancestor of liquid gold. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Enveloping the ten thousand things, it is the guiding principle of the Dao\"*—this is the meaning.\n\nMinister Dao annotates: The Great Elixir’s Dao relies entirely on lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury—these two substances. Cinnabar and mercury are the essence of the sun; lead and silver are the splendor of the moon. The method of refining liquid gold does not depart from the profound images of heaven and earth. The previous discussion has already made this quite clear, yet I still fear that students may not comprehend it, so I repeatedly employ analogies. If one understands the words immediately, then cinnabar and mercury can be obtained without labor. Moreover, the presence of cinnabar and mercury in lead is like the presence of human nature and emotions: nature and emotions arise within and respond without, not coming from outside. Cinnabar and mercury are born within and manifest without, also not coming from outside. The two functions of nature and emotions reside within the body; the two names of cinnabar and mercury both dwell within lead. When humans employ nature and emotions, they manifest externally; when lead contains cinnabar and mercury, they operate internally. Thus, one must distinguish their mechanisms. The *Cantong Qi*’s perfected person clearly points out: employ the essence of the sun and moon, combine them to form the medicine—do not use miscellaneous things or other methods.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Mutual Restraint of Being and Non-Being**\n\nMutual restraint of being and non-being: the Vermilion Bird flames in the void, the purple radiance shines like the sun—cinnabar and mercury perish.\n\nMinister Dao annotates: *Mutual restraint of being and non-being*—*being* is the tiger, *non-being* is the dragon; *being* is white metal, *non-being* is the qi of yin and yang. Using white metal as the spirit-chamber, it cannot generate transformation on its own; only through the ascent and descent of water and fire, circulating the four seasons, can the elixir be formed. Thus, an empty vessel is used to restrain being. The Vermilion Bird is the spirit-fire, steaming from below within the spirit-chamber, from which liquid gold is born through fire. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"To restrain being with non-being, the vessel must be empty\"*—this is the meaning. *The purple radiance shines like the sun—cinnabar and mercury perish* means that the purple radiance, the essence of the sun and moon, resides within the divine crucible. Sometimes it transforms into golden radiance, manifesting the light of the sun and moon; sometimes it changes into numinous liquid, revealing the forms of dragon and tiger. Shining within the crucible, it becomes cinnabar and mercury—now vanishing, now appearing; now floating, now sinking—following water and fire, sometimes perishing, sometimes disappearing. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Thus, one observes their ebb and flow—Kan and Li vanish and perish\"*—this is the meaning.\n\nMinister Dao elucidates: The ancients of high antiquity refined mercury alone into the elixir, for they had the dragon but not the tiger. Without relying on the Five Agents or Four Images, modeling heaven and earth, or guarding the union of husband and wife, yin and yang, male and female, they simply took the waxing and waning of yin and yang, Kan and Li’s qi within the body, and the essence of dragon and tiger nurtured within the seven orifices, trusting in spontaneity to unite with the Great Dao. Thus, the ancients all lived long lives without premature death. Since middle antiquity, if one wished to reverse aging, return to youth, prolong life, transcend the world, ascend to the real, and enter the wondrous, one had to install the furnace, establish the crucible, summon the harmonious qi of heaven and earth, and return the splendor of the sun and moon’s essence. Only when the Four Images are secure, the Five Agents complete, the nine revolutions finished, and the three thousand hours fulfilled—then, upon opening the furnace, purple powder congeals like frost, golden radiance shines like the sun. Ingesting it, one attains longevity after heaven and old age. Yet among people today, many know the tiger, but few recognize the dragon. The liquid gold is the Azure Dragon, the ancestor of the east’s Wood virtue—it is the sun.\n\nThe Yellow Sprout is the White Tiger, the ancestor of the west’s Metal liquid—it is the moon. The essence and qi of these two substances both possess principles of divine transformation and change. Thus, the scripture states: \"The essence of the sun and moon rescues the old and infirm.\" When refined with proper method and ingested, they too can effect transformation.\n\nAs for the transformations of the elixir: cinnabar transforms into mercury, which is yang returning to yin; mercury in turn transforms back into cinnabar, which is yin returning to yang. Though called the \"Pure Yang Elixir,\" when ingested by humans, it assuredly grants longevity. The sages compared the sun and moon’s hun and po to nothing but the positions of Kan and Li, with no other substances involved. Fearing that later generations might fail to grasp the true principle, they spoke plainly to instruct posterity.\n\n**Secret Formula, Chapter Ten: \"The Secret Formula Is Not Arbitrarily Composed\"**\nThe secret formula is not arbitrarily composed; its principles are not baseless fabrications. Condensing the profound to extend the subtle, one seeks the numinous and unfolds the trigrams and Five Agents into a classic. Kan is the male essence of Metal; Li is the female radiance of Fire. Metal and Wood contend; Water and Fire overcome each other. Earth flourishes in the Metal domain, and the three substances all perish. The Four Seas converge, bringing about great peace—all through the power of Earth’s virtue in the Central Palace, the achievement of the Yellow Emperor.\n\nYour servant Dao annotates: \"The secret formula is not arbitrarily composed; its principles are not baseless fabrications.\" The sages bequeathed writings to the world without careless composition or reckless speech to mislead later generations. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Words are not carelessly composed; theories are not idly generated.\"\n\n\"Condensing the profound to extend the subtle, one seeks the numinous\": cutting away the superfluous, one grasps the pivotal essentials, verifying the wondrous principles of the sun and moon and aligning with the supreme essence of the numinous. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Drawing verification to witness efficacy, one measures the numinous.\"\n\n\"Unfolding the trigrams and Five Agents into a classic\": embodying the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi* to determine the fire times, relying on the Five Agents—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—to govern generation and destruction, using the conjunction of the sun and moon to verify the union of husband and wife, and the intercourse of Kan and Li to produce the supreme essence. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Pursuing the origins of written characters to verify the principles.\"\n\n\"Kan is the male essence of Metal; Li is the female radiance of Fire\": Kan conceals the six *wu* (戊), the essence of the moon, the position of male yang residing in the north—the moon is yin. *Wu* is yang, the yang within yin, resembling Metal born within Water—the Tiger. Li conceals the six *ji* (己), the radiance of the sun, the position of female yin residing in the south—the sun is yang. *Ji* is yin, the yin within yang, resembling Mercury born within Fire—the Dragon. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Kan’s *wu* is the moon’s essence; Li’s *ji* is the sun’s radiance.\"\n\n\"Metal and Wood contend; Water and Fire overcome each other\": Metal is white Metal; Wood is red Mercury. When these two contend, they become ever more flourishing. When Water and Fire alternately overcome each other, great brilliance is manifest. As the sun and moon conjoin, hardness and softness mutually arise, and yin and yang attain their principles, then they harmoniously unite. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The sun and moon are the *Yi*; hardness and softness correspond.\"\n\n\"Earth flourishes in the Metal domain, and the three substances all perish\": the three substances—Metal, Wood, and Fire—are enveloped by the tail Fire of the four seasons. After nine revolutions, they are all transformed into the dust of the bright window. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving from beginning to end.\"\n\n\"The Four Seas converge, bringing about great peace\": inhaling and exhaling the qi of the four directions, they converge within the divine crucible. Drawing the essence of the Dragon and Tiger to become the supreme medicine, completing the work with the Five Earths and wrapping it with the four seasons, one obtains the red, green, black, and white, each performing its function to perfect the divine elixir. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Green, red, white, and black each reside in their respective directions.\"\n\n\"All through the power of Earth’s virtue in the Central Palace, the achievement of the Yellow Emperor\": the Earth virtue of the Central Palace is the supremely harmonious qi of *wu* and *ji*. The Way of the Metal liquid’s transformations all derives from *wu* and *ji*. *Wu* and *ji* reside in the Central Palace, hence called the Yellow Emperor. Those who refine the divine elixir gather the supreme essence of the sun and moon, unite the numinous qi of yin and yang, and when the cycles of the stars are complete and the movements of Water and Fire conclude, all return to the achievement of Earth’s virtue, the Yellow Emperor. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"All derive from the power of *wu* and *ji* in the Central Palace.\"\n\nYour servant Dao comments: The people of high antiquity did not speak idly; secrets were not transmitted twice. After success, they inscribed it on tablets to guide later generations of those who love the Dao. Moreover, what is conveyed in texts only outlines the general meaning. Now, pointing directly to the source of the great medicine, it enables later generations to dispense with worldly cinnabar and mercury. If one obtains the wondrous method and follows the movements of heaven and earth, yin and yang, and the four seasons to achieve the elixir, this is true yin and true yang. As the *Yinfu Jing* states: \"Heaven’s mechanism unfolds, and one does not die.\" Those who attain this Dao must not recklessly transmit it to others. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Inscribing feelings on bamboo and silk, one fears leaking the celestial tally, hesitating and sighing, constantly pondering.\"\n\nRefining the supreme medicine does not exceed Water and Fire. When Water and Fire have intercourse, the qi of the Dragon and Tiger within the crucible harmoniously unite to form the Metal liquid. Thus, true Lead is the father and mother of the golden elixir, the ancestor of numinous Mercury. All transformations and the nurturing of all beings derive from this to come into being. Once true Lead is obtained, the body is stabilized, and the true method of Water and Fire is known—how could the great elixir fail to be achieved?\n\n**Gold and Fire are Lead, Chapter Eleven**\nGold and Fire are Lead. When cinnabar is manifest, nothing is greater than Gold and Fire. Speaking of the profound to perfect transformation: when yang moves, yin dissipates; the primordial chaos ultimately unites. The nine treasures’ essences mutually sustain each other. Hexagrams and medicine unite. Gold has three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*; each *zhu* corresponds to one *jin*, which is sixteen *liang*. When the essence of Gold transforms, the two qi become the elixir. The Azure Dragon receives the tally at this time. Within the divine chamber, its essence is refined. Gold and Fire interact, propelling the male yang’s emerald-green Water and the female yin’s ochre-yellow Gold. Yin and yang intermingle, uniting their essences and enveloping the primordial qi. The ten thousand images rely on emptiness to arise; through resonance and transformation, each has its being. The numinous traces of the many elixirs—none do not derive from this for attaining longevity.\n\nYour servant Dao annotates: \"Gold and Fire are true Lead.\" The two characters \"Gold\" and \"Fire\" are the essence of the sun and moon. Gold is the root of the moon; Fire is the root of the sun—both are born within Lead. Master Wei took Gold and Fire as the *Yi* and the *Yi* as the medicine. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The *Yi* is the image.\" \"When cinnabar is manifest, nothing is greater than [Gold and Fire]\": cinnabar is the Metal liquid. The great elixir of the Metal liquid relies solely on the essence of the sun and moon to be achieved. \"Gold is Lead; the moon is Water.\"\n\nMercury is cinnabar; Fire is the sun. Externally, Water and Fire ascend and descend; internally, Lead and Mercury intertwine and conjoin—beyond these, no other elixirs may enter. The transformations of Gold and cinnabar arise wholly from the essence of the sun and moon. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When suspended images manifest their brightness, none are greater than the sun and moon.\" To speak of exhausting the subtle and mastering transformation: when Yang moves, Yin recedes. The ancients exhausted its subtleties and observed its waxing and waning, causing the qi of Yin and Yang to flow and rest in ceaseless circulation, completing the cycle of day and night. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Exhausting the numinous to know transformation: when Yang departs, Yin arrives.\"\n\nAt the culmination of primordial chaos, the nine treasures of essence mutually sustain one another. The qi of Kan and Li, Dragon and Tiger, intermingle within the numinous chamber, advancing and retreating with Water and Fire. At the outset, in the first palace of the Kan position, when the Fire number first stirs, essence and qi intermingle—this is before any transformation occurs. By the time of the Si position, when the Fire number reaches its apex, the Dragon generates Mercury and the Tiger generates Lead. The essence of Lead and Mercury gradually sprouts, while within the crucible, the qi of the sun and moon revolve externally, and the essence of Water and Fire unfolds and contracts internally. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Like spokes converging at the hub, they revolve, emerging and entering, ever unfolding and contracting.\"\n\nThe hexagrams and the medicine unite: Gold comprises three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*. Each *zhu* corresponds to one *liang*, and sixteen *liang* make one *jin*. The hexagrams contain three hundred and eighty-four lines, matching the number of days in a celestial cycle, which together govern the entire fire-phase. Gold consists of three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, and the Gold Mother totals one *jin*, which together govern the entire *jin* of the great elixir. The fire-phase and the Gold Mother thus perfectly correspond. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The *Yi* has three hundred and eighty-four lines; according to the lines, the tally is drawn.\"\n\nWhen the essence of Gold transforms, the Two Qi form the elixir. The Azure Dragon receives the tally: the Great Yin is the liquid of Metal-Tiger; the Great Yang is the fluid of Wood-Dragon. These transform into the true elixir. At the inception of the dark and new moon, when the Azure Dragon’s Fire Spirit assumes authority, the hexagram Zhen presides. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new, Zhen arrives to receive the tally.\"\n\nAt this very moment, within the numinous chamber, its essence is refined as Gold and Fire interact and propel one another—precisely when the Azure Dragon receives the tally and the fire is applied. Within the numinous chamber, the qi of Dragon and Tiger intertwine, the essence of Gold and Fire coalesce, and the numinous elixir is transformed. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"At this moment, Heaven and Earth conjoin their essence; the sun and moon mutually sustain one another.\"\n\nThe Azure Green Water of potent Yang and the Cinnabar Gold of latent Yin: potent Yang is Qian, Heaven.\n\nThe elder Yang is Qian, Heaven, the sun, and cinnabar. Its essence is called Azure Water, also known as \"feminine mercury.\" The elder Yin is Kun, Earth, the moon, and lead. Its essence is called Yellow Gold, also known as \"white gold.\" When the sun and moon conjoin within the crucible, the sun transforms into Azure Water and the moon transforms into Yellow Gold. Yellow Gold is true lead; Azure Water is true mercury. When lead and mercury merge as one, the elixir is formed. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The potent Yang scatters Azure essence; the latent Yin gathers Yellow transformation.\"\n\nWhen Yin and Yang intermingle, their essences unite, and primordial qi is enveloped—this refers to the qi of Yin and Yang, Dragon and Tiger, within the chaos, where Water and Fire interact and mutually transform, generating the fluid essence that becomes the foundation of the elixir. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"In the chaos of their union, the root and foundation are established.\"\n\nAll phenomena arise from emptiness, each responding to its own nature. All things in the world rely on primordial qi to take form, each fulfilling its nature and adhering to its shape. Within the crucible, the qi of Wood transforms into the Dragon, the qi of Metal into the Tiger, the qi of Fire into mercury, the qi of Water into lead, and the qi of Earth into harmony. The Five Qi all return to the Central Palace, nurturing the stem and calyx until spirit congeals into truth—each fulfilling its nature, solidifying into the real. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Tending and nurturing the stem and calyx, spirit congeals to form the body.\"\n\nThe wondrous traces of all elixirs, the path to immortality, all derive from this. Among the twenty-four grades of the Golden Elixir, only this is the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid—the very Way by which one ascends to heaven in broad daylight. Clearly mirroring the images of Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the stars and constellations, the Five Phases, and the four seasons, all converge within the numinous chamber, transforming into the Golden Fluid of immortality. There is no path to longevity that does not proceed from this. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"All creatures, from the crawling to the soaring, none do not arise from this.\"\n\nThe *Chendao Shu* states: \"Gold and Fire are indeed Lead and Fire.\"\n\nLead and Fire are indeed Water and Fire. When Gold and Fire interact, cinnabar is born within true Lead. What the ancients guarded most closely was the Fire Regimen alone. The Fire tally is one *jin*; the Mother tally is likewise one *jin*. When the Mother tally of one *jin* is divided, it becomes 384 *zhu*; when the Fire tally of one *jin* is divided, it becomes 384 *yao*, corresponding to the sixty-four hexagrams of a year. Thus, the tally of *Qian* is 216, and the tally of *Kun* is 144. Extending and expanding these, they reach 1,520, matching the tally of the myriad things and completing one cycle of Heaven and Earth. The ancients modeled their methods upon Heaven and Earth, aligning with the rise and fall of Yin and Yang, the ascent and descent of Water and Fire, the nature of Gold and Wood, and the embodiment of hardness and softness—thereby perfecting the transformations of the Great Dao. The tallies of *Qian* and *Kun*, each *yao* unfolding the Fire Regimen, reveal the subtleties of the Great Elixir’s numbers, manifesting the essence of Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—these are the celestial signs. The refined supreme medicine and the movement of the Fire Regimen all accord with the numbers of these celestial signs. If one condenses the numbers of years, months, days, and hours into the twelve hours of a single day, advancing the Yang Fire and retreating the Yin tally to refine the Golden Fluid Divine Elixir, then the principle of creation can be immediately attained.\n\nThereupon, in *Chapter Twelve: The Mysterious Moisture and Radiant Luster*, the Primordial Sovereign of Mysterious Moisture and Radiant Luster begins to refine Mercury within the numinous chamber, which embraces the hollow and profound, where the Mysterious White gives birth to Lord Gold. Towering and majestic, he establishes the primordial beginning, as the Three and Five guard one another, their flying essence nourishing and moistening.\n\nThe *Chendao Annotation* states: \"Here, the Primordial Sovereign of Mysterious Moisture and Radiant Luster begins to refine Mercury within the numinous chamber, which embraces the hollow and profound—this is when black Lead is transmuted into the essence of white Gold, its luster penetrating through to form the body of the numinous chamber, hollow within and an inch in diameter, to generate true Mercury. The Primordial Sovereign is the master who refines the Golden Elixir. As the *Baopuzi* states: 'The Primordial Sovereign herself said, “I too refined the Elixir and attained immortality.”' Fu Xi drew the Eight Trigrams, and Confucius expounded the *Yijing* images—both clarified these numbers of Heaven and Earth. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Thus, Confucius praised the Primal Chaos, where the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* embraces the hollow and profound.' The Mysterious White gives birth to Lord Gold, towering and majestic, establishing the primordial beginning—this is the Mysterious generating white Gold. Thus, it can gather and nurture the essence of the sun and moon. Before the Yang Fire moves, both are concealed within white Gold, their forms unseen. Once Water and Fire circulate, the Gold Flower emerges from within white Gold—the Gold Flower is the harmonious *qi* of *wu* and *si*. When these two substances meet and interact, they generate the Elixir, which may truly be called towering and exalted. Investigating the ancient origins, this substance has always existed, enveloping Yin and Yang, never departing from the forms of the myriad things. The meaning of the *Guanju* lies in this: when Water and Fire interact, cinnabar and Mercury are born, and spirit and illumination emerge. Thus, it is the mother of the myriad things and the beginning of Yin and Yang. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Examining antiquity, when the Primordial Sovereign reigned, the *Guanju* established the primordial beginning.' The Three and Five guard one another, their flying essence moistening and nourishing the Fluid.\"\n\nWhen Water, Fire, and Earth interact, the divine essence descends into the crucible. Thus, the ancient sages established the divine chamber—the *Jiji* crucible—where the forms of male and female unite, and the shapes of Dragon and Tiger merge. At first, form and substance remain undifferentiated, like primordial chaos. After the firing process, the essences of husband and wife intertwine, the passions of Dragon and Tiger harmonize, and the *yuan-nian* begins, bowing at its inception to ultimately refine the divine medicine.\n\nAs the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When the marriage *qi* intertwines, the *yuan-nian* sprouts and flourishes.\" The *Chendao Shu* says: \"The Primordial Sovereign, who refined the Elixir and attained immortality, was the ancestral master of antiquity. He modeled the numbers of Heaven and Earth, approximated the movements of the Sun and Moon, and with the crucible—symbolizing Qian and Kun—left a hollow space of slightly over an inch to house the numinous Mercury. This method mirrors the dynamic: when movement arises, Heaven’s *qi* descends, Earth’s *qi* responds, and the supreme essences of Heaven and Earth interact to generate the divine fluid.\" Truly towering and exalted, this is the most wondrous mystery.\n\nAncient immortals who attained the Dao feared that later generations would fail to grasp the true principle. Thus, they used cinnabar, Mercury, and various other medicinal substances to concoct the Great Elixir, unaware of the transformations of true Lead. Therefore, they employed symbolic language to enlighten disciples. If one resorts to miscellaneous methods, it is like entering the mountains to catch fish or a dragon seeking pheasants and hares in water—both are futile endeavors, a waste of effort.\n\n---\n\n*The Mysterious Woman Expounds Her Preface*, Chapter Thirteen:\n*The Mysterious Woman Expounds Her Preface: Wu and Si Prize the Celestial Tally*\n\nThe Celestial Tally’s Dao gradually wanes, making it difficult to align with the Mysterious Diagram. The *Chendao* annotation states: \"*The Mysterious Woman Expounds Her Preface: Wu and Si Prize the Celestial Tally*—the Mysterious Woman embodies the spirit of Heaven and Earth, the numinous *qi* of Yin and Yang. Her spirit permeates all, her form pervades everything. She knows the nature of the myriad things and comprehends the patterns of all transformations, serving as the sovereign of the Daoist teachings. *Wu* and *Si* are the harmonious *qi*, the root of the Great Elixir. When the Celestial Tally moves, it generates the essence of *Wu* and *Si*.\"\n\nAs the *Cantong Qi* says: \"The sage does not arise in vain; above, he observes the manifest Celestial Tally.\" \"*The Celestial Tally’s Dao gradually wanes, making it difficult to align with the Mysterious Diagram*—the Celestial Tally advances in *zi*, the Yang Fire increasing daily until *si*, where Yang reaches its peak. The Celestial Tally retreats in *wu*, the Yin tally decreasing daily until *hai*, where Yin reaches its extreme. The Five Phases exhaust their mutual conquest, and the four seasons complete their cycle, hence the Dao gradually wanes.\"\n\nAs the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The Celestial Tally has advance and retreat, contraction and extension, to correspond with the seasons. Thus, the *Yi* governs the heart of Heaven.\" The *Chendao Shu* says: \"The Mysterious Woman is also an ancient immortal, the leader of all immortals. *Wu* and *Si* are Earth; the Celestial Tally is Fire. Fire is the primordial *qi*. Vast, it encompasses Heaven and Earth; minute, it hides within a single hair. The ten thousand numinous transformations all partake of its primordial *qi*. Its vastness envelops and embraces, its subtlety permeates and spreads, giving birth, nurturing, restraining, and overcoming. The cycles of Metal and Water revolve, Yin and Yang flourish and wither, and the myriad things transform without end. It possesses the most wondrous and supreme efficacy. The Perfected One borrows this numinous transformation to cultivate the supreme medicine, gathering the supreme essences of the Sun and Moon, harmonizing warmth, coolness, cold, and heat, extracting and adding Water and Fire, following the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and aligning with the four seasons’ flourishing, waning, prosperity, and decline—all in accord with nature. If one uses gold, silver, herbs, or frost to concoct the Golden Fluid and divine Elixir, how could such transformations ever arise?\"\n\n*Ancient Text: Dragon and Tiger Classic, Annotated and Explained, Volume One*\n*From the Imperial Four Treasuries*\n\n**Ancient Text: Dragon and Tiger Classic, Annotated and Explained, Volume Two**\n*By Wang Dao of the Song Dynasty*\n**Chapter Fourteen: On the Intent of Concocting the Elixir**\n\nThus, the intent of concocting the Elixir—Heaven and Earth no longer speak of it. Cinnabar flows as mercury; Father is *wu* and *ji*, Mother is yellow gold. The bell and pitch-pipe return the two sixes; the Dipper’s handle establishes the three nines. The Crimson Youth plays with the Vermilion Bird, transforming into the Azure Dragon.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Annotation:**\n\"Thus, the intent of concocting the Elixir—Heaven and Earth no longer speak of it\" refers to the previous chapter, which expounded the intent of the Great Elixir, establishing the divine chamber and exhausting its wondrous principles. Thus, this chapter no longer repeats it.\n\n\"Cinnabar flows as mercury; Father is *wu* and *ji*, Mother is yellow gold\": Cinnabar is the Sun; flowing mercury is the Sun’s spirit. *Wu* and *ji* are the Moon; yellow gold is the Moon’s essence. Cinnabar and *wu-ji* generate these two flavors—spirit and essence—to become the supreme medicine, hence they are called Father and Mother.\n\n\"The bell and pitch-pipe return the two sixes; the Dipper’s handle establishes the three nines\": The two sixes refer to *zi, yin, chen, wu, shen, xu* as the six *lü* (pitch-pipes), and *chou, mao, si, wei, you, hai* as the six *lü* (harmonics). Moreover, *zi* is the Yellow Bell, and *wu* is the Jade Flute, which govern the twelve hours. The three nines also make twelve. The Dipper’s pointer determines the establishment: the first month establishes *yin*, the second month establishes *mao*, and so on through the twelve branches. As the *Canon of Pivoting Harmony* states: \"Waxing and waning respond to the pitch-pipes; rising and falling rely on the Dipper’s pivot.\"\n\n\"The Crimson Youth plays with the Vermilion Bird, transforming into the Azure Dragon\": The Crimson Youth is the Sun; the Vermilion Bird is Fire. Once Fire moves, the Sun generates mercury within the divine chamber, hence it is named the Azure Dragon. An ancient poem says: \"The Five Agents’ inverted art—dragons emerge from Fire.\"\n\n**Minister Dao’s Exegesis:**\nThe Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams determine fortune and misfortune. Thus, *Qian* is Heaven—still, it is concentrated; in motion, it is straight. *Kun* is Earth—still, it contracts; in motion, it expands. Therefore, the classic states: \"*Qian* and *Kun* are the body of Heaven and Earth; *Kan* and *Li* are the function of Heaven and Earth.\" The Dao gives birth to Heaven; Heaven gives birth to Earth; Earth gives birth to the myriad things. Thus, the movement and stillness of *Qian* and *Kun* give rise to the myriad things—this is Heaven.\n\nThe former is emptiness—yang, hardness, the sun, the father, Heaven. The latter is fullness—yin, softness, the moon, the mother, Earth. All below emptiness is Earth; all above fullness is Heaven. Thus, the interplay of emptiness and fullness gives rise to the six lines’ transformations. Therefore, *Qian* employs seven and nine, while *Kun* employs six and eight. The numbers of the Four Images correspond to the numbers of *Qian* and *Kun*, revealing the distinctions between old and young yin and yang. Four interacting with six yields twenty-four, thus forming the boundary of one old yin line; four interacting with eight yields thirty-two, forming the boundary of one young yin line; four interacting with seven yields twenty-eight, forming the boundary of one young yang line; four interacting with nine yields thirty-six, forming the boundary of one old yang line. These four boundaries constitute the completion numbers of *Qian* and *Kun*. The transformations of six and nine give rise to the generative numbers of the six lines.\n\nUsing old yin and old yang—nine and six—*Qian* and *Kun* alternate in transformation, while young yang and young yin—seven and eight—do not partake. *Qian* has six lines, and Earth receives three; *Kun* has six lines, and Heaven receives three. The two trigrams *Qian* and *Kun* form the transformative body of Heaven and Earth, perpetually merging as one and unfolding within the six voids, ascending and descending with the two qi of yin and yang, shifting and changing amid the six lines.\n\nWhen *Qian* moves, it is straight and unyielding—yang fire blazes forth from below Earth, transforming *Kun*’s lower line into *Fu*. This is called \"Initial Nine,\" the master of the six yang lines, where subtle yang has just arisen. The second transformation becomes *Lin*, where yang qi begins to flow; the third transformation brings yin and yang into communion, forming *Tai*, as the myriad things sprout, breaking through the earth. The fourth transformation becomes *Dazhuang*, where the myriad things flourish; the fifth transformation becomes *Guai*, where all plants reveal their essence. By the time of the \"Upper Nine,\" it transforms into pure *Qian*—yang light radiates brilliantly, suffusing the southwest with lush vegetation. The yang light ascends above, the five colors gleam upon the head, and wells and springs freeze—this is the time of *Qian*’s full cycle.\n\nWhen *Kun* moves, it expands without obstruction—yin stillness, solemn and serene, emerges from above Heaven, transforming *Qian*’s lower line into *Gou*. This is called \"Initial Six,\" the master of the six yin lines, where subtle yin has just arisen. The second transformation becomes *Dun*, where yin qi begins to flow; the third transformation severs the communion of yin and yang, forming *Pi*, as the myriad things ripen, their fruits hanging low. The fourth transformation becomes *Guan*, where the myriad things wither; the fifth transformation becomes *Bo*, where all plants return to concealment. By the time of the \"Upper Six,\" it transforms into pure *Kun*—yin essence, chilling and pervasive, blankets the southwest with withered, yellowed vegetation. Yin essence sinks below, the five colors hide within the roots, and wells and springs grow warm—this is the time of *Kun*’s full cycle.\n\nThus, the classic states: \"The sun enters the earth, forming the image of congealed essence; after a second transformation, it becomes *Fu*, giving birth to the myriad things.\" From this, we know that the two bodies of *Qian* and *Kun* shift and move with the qi of yin and yang, ascending and descending within the six voids. One darkness, one brightness—cycling endlessly through day and night, the sun departs and the moon arrives, like a ring without end, beyond all reckoning. Only the singular, primal, harmonious qi brings about these transformations.\n\nThe ancient perfected ones understood the waxing and waning of Heaven and Earth, the expansion and contraction of yin and yang. Thus, they entrusted the *Yi*’s images to model *Qian* and *Kun*, aligning yin and yang with water and fire. They summoned the supreme harmony of Heaven and Earth, drew forth the pure essence of the sun and moon, and gathered them within the divine chamber. There, they transformed the liquid gold, transmuting the mortal frame into a sacred body. With merits complete and virtues fulfilled, their titles became \"Perfected Ones.\" Who would not call them divine?\n\n**Minister Dao’s Annotation on *Kun*’s Initial Transformation into *Zhen* (Chapter Fifteen):**\nWhen *Kun*’s first transformation yields *Zhen*, on the third day, the moon emerges at *geng*, dividing east and west between *mao* and *you*. Dragon and tiger seek each other.\n\nWhen *Kun*’s second transformation yields *Dui*, on the eighth day, the moon emerges at *ding*, its upper half like a balance. Half a catty of gold.\n\nWhen *Kun*’s third transformation yields *Qian*, on the fifteenth day, the three yang lines are complete, illuminating the east at *jia*. Metal and water grow warm; the sun’s red marrow flows as mercury. The maiden plays with golden earrings; the moon waxes and naturally conjoins.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Commentary:**\nWhen *Kun*’s first transformation yields *Zhen*, on the third day, the moon emerges at *geng*: at midnight before the new moon, at the *zi* hour, the initial movement of yang fire begins. The sun and moon conjoin at the *Bi* and *Mao* constellations, where *Qian* intersects *Kun*’s lower line to form the *Zhen* trigram. *Zhen* governs affairs—one yang line arises below, so by the third day, the moon appears at the *geng* direction. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"On the third day, it emerges as brightness; *Zhen* receives *geng* in the west.\"\n\n\"Dividing east and west between *mao* and *you*, dragon and tiger seek each other\": The east and west gates of the two eights are the directions of the sun and moon’s rising and setting. Once metal and water are properly positioned and the fire time has advanced five days, the qi of dragon and tiger yearn for each other, gathering within the crucible.\n\nWhen *Kun*’s second transformation yields *Dui*, on the eighth day, the moon emerges at *ding*, its upper half like a balance: From the sixth to the eighth day, the upper half is complete. *Qian* intersects *Kun*’s second line to form the *Dui* trigram, which governs affairs—two yang lines arise in the middle, so the moon’s light achieves half-illumination, level as a cord, appearing at the *ding* direction. This illustrates the crucible where metal and fire are evenly matched. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*; the upper half is level as a cord.\"\n\nWhen *Kun*’s third transformation yields *Qian*, on the fifteenth day, the three yang lines are complete, illuminating the east at *jia*: From the eleventh to the fifteenth day, *Qian* intersects *Kun*’s upper line to form the *Qian* trigram, which governs affairs—three yang lines arise above, so the moon’s light becomes full, appearing at the *jia* direction. This illustrates the crucible where the metal’s virtue is complete, having received the fire time. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"On the fifteenth day, the *Qian* body is replete, full at *jia* in the east.\"\n\n\"Metal and water grow warm; the sun’s red marrow flows as mercury; the maiden plays with golden earrings; the moon waxes and naturally conjoins\": By this time, the divine elixir of liquid gold—with the sun’s essence now abundant—fills the divine chamber. The qi of metal and fire transforms into mercury, which, along with its mother, lingers in mutual affection, transmuting the golden body. Toad and hare essence intertwine, enveloping each other; their radiance illuminates the crucible. The maiden’s body naturally forms adornments, manifesting golden earrings—an analogy for the crucible where the metal qi gradually flourishes, transforming into the elixir. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Toad and hare essence—sun and moon, peerless in brightness. The toad, observing the hexagram’s nodes, spits forth radiant light.\"\n\nFrom the first to the fifteenth day of the great yin, the light fills; from the sixteenth day onward, it naturally conjoins. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"At seven and eight, the Dao is complete; bending and folding, it descends.\"\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Sixteenfold Mutual Diminution**\n\nThe sixteenfold mutual diminution: when Qian’s first line is diminished, it forms Feng, and the bright moon appears at Xin. When Qian’s second line is diminished, it forms Gen, and at twenty-three, the lower half-measure of water weighs half a catty, the moon emerging in the south at Bing. When Qian’s third line is diminished, it forms Kun, and on the thirtieth day, in the northeast, it loses its brightness, the moon setting at Yi-earth. As Kun and Yi-moon darken, earth, water, and metal are about to transform. Kun gives birth to Zhen the Dragon.\n\nMinister Dao’s annotation states: \"The sixteenfold mutual diminution—when Qian’s first line is diminished to form Feng, and the bright moon appears at Xin—refers to the period after the sixteenth day, when Kun interchanges with Qian’s lower line to form the Feng hexagram. Feng governs affairs: one yin line arises below as yang fire begins its retreat and yin tally first emerges. At dawn, the moon appears in the Xin direction, just as when yang fire first advances, the moon is three days old. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'At sixteenfold reception, Feng governs; Xin appears at dawn.'\n\nWhen Qian’s second line is diminished to form Gen, at twenty-three, the lower half-measure of water weighs half a catty, and the moon emerges in the south at Bing. From the sixteenth day, as yin tally retreats to the twenty-third, Kun interchanges with Qian’s middle line to form the Gen hexagram. Gen governs affairs: two yin lines arise in the center, and the moon appears in the Bing direction, again corresponding to the upper half-measure. This signifies that within the crucible, metal and water are evenly balanced. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Gen aligns with Bing in the south; the lower half-measure at twenty-three.'\n\nWhen Qian’s third line is diminished to form Kun, on the thirtieth day, in the northeast, it loses its brightness, the moon setting at Yi-earth. From the twenty-sixth to the twenty-eighth day, Kun interchanges with Qian’s upper line to form the Kun hexagram. Kun governs affairs: three yin lines arise above, and the moon’s light nears its end, appearing in the Yi direction. Reaching the northeast, yang light is entirely spent—this is called the loss of brightness. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Kun and Yi, on the thirtieth day, in the east, lose their brightness.'\n\nWhen Kun and Yi-moon darken, earth, wood, and metal are about to transform, and Kun gives birth to Zhen the Dragon. From the twenty-eighth to the thirtieth day, yin tally is exhausted, and the qi of yin and yang each come to rest. Earth, metal, and water combine into a liquid; the six yang qi do not unite with the moon. The body of Great Yin turns wholly dark, traversing the northeast and passing over Mao and Bi, where sun and moon conjoin. Water and fire are again applied, returning to their origin, taking Fu as the first hexagram. Kun transforms into Zhen, which pertains to wood and resides in the east—hence it is called the Dragon. Moreover, yang fire is the Dragon. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'When the node is exhausted, they alternate; with the transformation of the body, the Dragon is reborn.'\n\nMinister Dao’s commentary states: From Zi to Si, yang fire advances for six hours, governed by Zhen, Dui, and Qian—this is the movement of Great Yin, the image of metal liquid. Fu, Lin, Tai, Da Zhuang, and Guai, governed by Qian, are the movement of Great Yang, the image of yang fire. From Wu to Hai, yin tally retreats for six hours, governed by Feng, Gen, and Kun—this is the movement of Great Yin, the image of metal liquid. Gou, Dun, Pi, Guan, Bo, and Kun are the movement of Great Yin, the image of yin tally. The transformations of metal and water within the crucible are governed by twelve lines and twelve hours; the movements of the moon’s radiance in the heavens are governed by six hexagrams and twelve hours. The *Cantong Qi* speaks of this in great detail, yet people fail to perceive it clearly.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao, desiring to refine this Great Elixir, must understand astronomy above, geography below, and human nature within. Only then can they adapt to the transformations of creation, grasp yin and yang in hand, revolve the sun and moon within the furnace, and breed the Dragon and Tiger. They unite Qian and Kun within the chamber, nurturing essence and fluids. The Metal Mother labors without exhaustion; the Wood Father achieves success with ease. The metal liquid transforms, cinnabar mercury takes form, the nine revolutions conclude, and yang light changes—this is the Yellow Chariot, named the Dust of the Bright Window. Not only does it transmute cinnabar into gold, but when ingested, it equals heaven in longevity. The marvels of transformation cannot be surpassed.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Qian and Kun Encompass Beginning and End**\n\nQian and Kun encompass beginning and end—thus it is said: Zhen the Dragon. As above, over thirty days, Kun gives birth to Zhen, Dui, and Qian; Qian gives birth to Feng, Gen, and Kun. The eight hexagrams are arrayed, their luminous movements shifting without losing the center.\n\nMinister Dao’s annotation states: Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end—thus it is said: Zhen the Dragon. Qian and Kun are the father and mother of all hexagrams. The two hexagrams interweave to form the eight hexagrams: Qian first interchanges with Kun’s lower line to form Zhen, marking the new moon at the first day’s midnight, the Zi hour, the beginning of yang fire’s arising. Kun then interchanges with Qian’s lower line to form Feng, beginning at the sixteenth day’s midnight, the Zi hour, the start of yin tally’s arising. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Ren and Gui pair with Jia and Yi; Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end.'\n\nAs above, over thirty days, Kun gives birth to Zhen, Dui, and Qian: Kun gives birth to Zhen, governing the first five days as the direct tally; next, it gives birth to Dui, governing the middle five days as the direct tally; then, it gives birth to Qian, governing the last five days as the direct tally. Great Yang stands for fifteen days, reaching fullness at Jia above, and the metal liquid in the crucible also flourishes, increasing in accord with the hexagrams.\n\nQian gives birth to Feng, governing the first five days as the direct tally; next, it gives birth to Gen, governing the middle five days as the direct tally; then, it gives birth to Kun, governing the last five days as the direct tally. Great Yin stands for fifteen days, its light exhausted in the northeast, the Gen region, and the metal liquid in the crucible also reaches fullness, forming in accord with the hexagrams. Qian and Kun mutually generate and extinguish over thirty days, the cycle of one month. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond. The four together make thirty—yang qi seeks extinction and concealment.'\n\nThe eight hexagrams are arrayed, their luminous movements shifting without losing the center. As above, the eight hexagrams are arrayed within one month’s thirty days, moving yang fire and yin tally, each converging within the divine chamber to transform the Great Elixir and metal liquid. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'The eight hexagrams are arrayed; their luminous movements shift without losing the center.'\n\nMinister Dao’s commentary states: The human body also embodies heaven and earth. Within it, the ascent and descent of yin and yang likewise correspond to the transformations of creation. Yet, through the six desires and seven emotions, they are expressed externally, while essence and qi are depleted internally. All day long, one rushes about heedlessly, unaware of reflection. If one can know this Dao, follow yin and yang, and guard simplicity with tranquility, then heaven and earth will externally interact while the body internally harmonizes. Each will respond to its ascent and descent. With minimal thought and no harm, one will naturally prolong life. How much more so when establishing the furnace and crucible, modeling heaven and earth, summoning the essence of sun and moon, and drawing the harmonious qi of yin and yang to refine the divine medicine and ingest it—how could one not become an immortal?\n\nTo craft the golden liquor, one must first understand the numerical degrees traversed by Qian and Kun in the eight trigrams over the course of a month—thirty days in total. The sun moves one degree per day, while the moon moves thirteen degrees. Though both complete one cycle in a month, they converge in the same palace, known as the new moon. The sun travels thirty degrees, and the moon three hundred ninety-five degrees, passing through twelve months before reuniting with the sun above the Dipper mansion on the winter solstice.\n\nThus, the perfected one uses the degrees of the sun and moon’s movement as the period for firing in one month: the first fifteen days are governed by Zhen, Dui, and Qian, while the latter fifteen are governed by Xun, Gen, and Kun. Kan and Li hold their positions, with yang fire and yin tally advancing or retreating according to the time, all in accordance with the symbolic lines of the trigrams.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Regulating the Fire for Sixty Days**\nRegulating the fire for sixty days brings about transformations that serve as proof. The divine chamber takes on a form resembling a chicken’s egg, with the Five Peaks standing in concealment and the cavern’s gate possessing a pivot and bolt.\n\nMinister Dao’s annotation: \"Regulating the fire for sixty days brings about transformations that serve as proof\" refers to the original essence within the crucible, whose state is difficult to observe. After completing one month’s cycle and opening the crucible, one may find golden blossoms descending or jade liquid congealing slowly—these are signs of excess or deficiency in yin tally and yang fire. Thus, another month of firing is required to complete the alchemical process.\n\nTherefore, as the original essence in the crucible receives the externally applied tally-fire, each transformation is subtle and hard to perceive. Yet by observing the twelve time-periods and the firing conditions of the trigrams, one can discern its movements, whether sinking or floating. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The original essence is subtle and hard to perceive; one infers its effects by observing the tally’s signs.\"\n\n\"The divine chamber takes on a form resembling a chicken’s egg\" means that the ancient perfected ones, gazing up at the celestial patterns and examining the earth’s principles, modeled the divine chamber after Heaven and Earth, shaping it like a chicken’s egg. Within its hollow center, a space of slightly over an inch is reserved for the numinous mercury. As the *Cantong Qi* says: \"When dwelling, observe its image and approximate its form.\"\n\n\"The Five Peaks stand in concealment, and the cavern’s gate possesses a pivot and bolt\" describes how the sacred mountains on earth are divided into the Five Peaks, all interconnected in hidden ways. The ancients established markers to serve as models, constructing altars, furnaces, crucibles, and stoves in accordance with the mysterious method, ensuring their intricate connections allowed the fire’s qi to circulate without obstruction. If the firing conditions scatter externally, fortune or misfortune arises internally. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Erect markers to serve as standards; observe the omens to determine fortune or misfortune.\"\n\nMinister Dao’s commentary: Before Heaven and Earth separated, their form resembled a chicken’s egg. After their separation, the yang fire ascended, and the light, pure qi congealed to form Heaven, while the yin water sank, and the heavy, turbid qi congealed to form Earth—this is called the fixed positions of Heaven and Earth. The divine chamber consists of an upper cauldron as Heaven and a lower cauldron as Earth, their two halves joined to resemble a chicken’s egg. Within its hollow center, slightly over an inch of space is called the fixed position of the divine chamber. When Heaven and Earth interact, fire is born within water and ascends, while water is born within fire and descends, converging within the true earth to produce medicinal substances. Similarly, in the divine chamber, fire arises from Kan and water descends from Li, converging within Wu and Ji to generate the numinous mercury—such profound and wondrous secrets can be known.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: The Initial Firing is Gentle and Subtle**\nThe initial firing is gentle and subtle, like the movement of a line in the trigrams. Above, it bears the essence of yellow gold; below, it carries the primordial Kun. Its form is harmonious, flowing with pure fluid, and when examined, it unites the Three Powers. Qian moves in response to the Three Luminaries, while Kun remains still, containing yang qi.\n\nMinister Dao’s annotation: \"The initial firing is gentle and subtle, like the movement of a line in the trigrams\" means that when initiating the divine elixir’s firing, one must follow the symbolic lines of the trigrams and align with the twelve months’ waxing and waning. For instance, the hexagram *Fu* (Return), representing the winter solstice, governs the season when the lowest line transforms into yang, corresponding to the *zi* hour.\n\nAt this time, the firing is not yet forceful but merely warm—this is called \"soft fire,\" corresponding to the initial generation of the single yang line in *Fu*. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Issue commands in accordance with the seasons; do not miss the time when the lines move.\"\n\n\"Above, it bears the essence of yellow gold; below, it carries the primordial Kun\" refers to yellow gold as Qian Heaven, the upper cauldron, and Kun as Kun Earth, the lower cauldron. The two cauldrons combine to form the divine chamber. As the *Cantong Qi* says: \"Above, examine the patterns of the *He Tu*; below, recount the earth’s forms.\"\n\n\"Its form is harmonious, flowing with pure fluid, and when examined, it unites the Three Powers\" means that once the divine chamber is positioned, the pure fluid and numinous mercury are generated within it. The numinous center of the middle palace also symbolizes the human heart-mind’s dwelling. Thus, when Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are complete, the myriad things are named, and the Five Agents are activated. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Examine the center in relation to the human heart, uniting the Three Powers.\"\n\n\"Qian moves in response to the Three Luminaries; Kun remains still, containing yang qi\" refers to Qian as Heaven, the sun, and fire.\n\nWithin the empty vessel, as Qian’s primordial movement stirs, the essence of water and fire arises, producing the golden fluid. Kun is Earth, the moon, and water. As Kun’s primordial stillness abides, the essence of moon, water, and metal harmonizes with the flowing pearl of great yang, enclosing it to prevent its flight. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"In motion, it follows the changes of the hexagrams; in stillness, it adheres to the judgments of the *tuan*. When Qian and Kun are put into practice, how can one not proceed with utmost care?\"\n\nThe *Chendao Shu* says: The sun occupies the position of *Li*, dwelling in the south amid *Bing* and *Ding*—the true seat of fire. The sun also contains fire, and fire transforms its body to become mercury; thus, it is said that mercury is born from the sun. Mercury is yang, called the yang spirit. The *Li* hexagram consists of two yang lines and one yin line, with *Si* earth as its spirit, and it is also the middle daughter of Kun. The sun employs *Si* earth as its light—*Si* being a yin position—so its image corresponds to the *Li* hexagram. Moreover, the sun’s light contains a dark hue, which, shifting from blue to red, becomes cinnabar.\n\nThe moon belongs to the position of *Kan*, residing in the north amid *Ren* and *Gui*—the true seat of water. The moon also contains water and transforms its body to become metal; thus, it is said that metal is born from the moon. Metal is yin, called the yin soul. The *Kan* hexagram consists of two yin lines and one yang line, with *Wu* earth as its spirit, and it is also the middle son of Qian. The moon employs *Wu* earth as its essence—*Wu* earth being a yang position—so its image corresponds to the *Kan* hexagram. Moreover, the moon’s essence contains a pale hue, which, shifting from white to black, becomes black lead.\n\nMercury, containing the qi of *Li*, aligns with the position of the yin line. This mercury is not the common quicksilver or cinnabar of the world but originates within great yang; *Li* names it the water spirit, calling it true mercury. Lead, containing the qi of *Kan*, aligns with the position of the yang line. This lead is not the salt lead of Jiazhou or that found among rocks but originates within great yin; *Kan* names it white metal, calling it true lead.\n\nLead divides into two, forming the two poles of the divine chamber. Mercury arises from the one, the single qi of the dark fluid. Together, they image the Three Powers as Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\n\n*Guwen Longhu Jing Zhushu*, Middle Scroll\n*Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu*\n*Guwen Longhu Jing Zhushu*, Lower Scroll\nBy Wang Dao of the Song Dynasty\nChapter Twenty: \"The Divine Chamber’s Prior Practice\"\n\nThe Divine Chamber’s Prior Practice: Only after first applying the golden elixir can completion be firm. The qi of refinement and transformation envelops and congeals in flight; the numinous portal opens and closes, the abode of the subtle and imperceptible, the cavern of creation and transformation.\n\nMinister Dao’s Annotation: \"Only after first applying the golden elixir can completion be firm\" means that once the Divine Chamber is established and its method attained, the golden liquid necessarily follows the principle of completion. \"Can it not be firm? The qi of refinement and transformation envelops and congeals in flight\" signifies that the adept refining the elixir must first firmly prepare the crucible and vessel, ensuring the numinous mercury within solidifies and congeals without escaping, only then can the elixir be formed. \"The numinous portal opens and closes, the abode of the subtle and imperceptible, the cavern of creation and transformation\" describes how the Divine Chamber possesses upper and lower cauldrons: when open, they are two; when closed, they are one. Within, the void space allows water and fire to interact, and the numinous substance is born. Thus, it is called the subtle and imperceptible. White metal becomes the elixir and generates mercury, termed the golden liquid. This is the treasury and cavern of the elixir.\n\nMinister Dao’s Exegesis: The water of the north generates and completes white metal, calling it true lead, the essence of utmost yin. It contains the harmonious yang, following the qi of primordial chaos as it divides and returns each to its original unity. The perfected of antiquity modeled the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s generation and completion, returning the harmonious yang qi to true lead, containing its natural function to refine the great medicine. This is the qi of true origin, not something worldly substances can achieve. If the methods of cultivation and refinement are correct and the system reasonable, how can one fail to complete the great elixir? The dragon and tiger, both born within lead, through the ascent and descent of water and fire, cause metal and wood to interact in the abode of the subtle and imperceptible. The cavern of creation and transformation guards the waxing and waning of the sun and moon. White metal, as mother, envelops the multitude of spirits to produce the supreme treasure.\n\nChapter Twenty-One: \"Yang Qi Arises in Kun\"\nYang qi arises in Kun; the sundial points to the southern extreme. The five stars form a pearl string; the sun and moon unite as jade discs. Golden sand adheres to its division, breathing in resonance.\n\nMinister Dao’s Annotation: \"Yang qi arises in Kun; the sundial points to the southern extreme\" refers to the end of the tenth month, when the pure Kun hexagram concludes, and the beginning of the eleventh month, the midnight hour of the zi period, when the Kun hexagram’s lower line generates one yang line, forming the Fu hexagram—this is the time when yang fire is born. Progressing through chou, yin, and reaching si, yang qi reaches its extreme in the south, then yin arises at wu. \"The five stars form a pearl string; the sun and moon unite as jade discs\" describes how the five stars traverse the celestial circuit like a string of pearls, with varying speeds, stations, retrogradations, and progressions. The sun and moon’s degrees converge once a month in union, their jade-disc conjunction aligning with the five stars to mutually verify the year’s use of metal and fire. \"Golden sand adheres to its division, breathing in resonance\" means golden sand is the essence of the sun and moon. As water and fire ascend and descend, inhaling and exhaling, golden sand in the crucible rises and sinks, following the rhythm of breath to resonate with the externally applied fire.\n\nMinister Dao’s Exegesis: True lead is the mother, Kun, the body of great yin, perpetually dark. Only upon encountering yang fire does it take form. Once formed, it traverses the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines, transforming endlessly, all following the numerical movements of the sun, moon, and five stars. If one uses miscellaneous substances for the elixir, how can it follow the yin-yang and four seasons to generate? As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The sun contains the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the discipline of the six pitch-pipes.\"\n\nChapter Twenty-Two: \"The Canopy of Flowers Descends\"\nThe canopy of flowers descends; the Three Terraces assist below. They govern the records and administrations, ensuring firmness and scrutinizing competence.\n\nMinister Dao’s Annotation: \"The canopy of flowers descends; the Three Terraces assist below, governing the records and administrations, ensuring firmness and scrutinizing competence\" describes how the canopy of flowers, sixteen stars shaped like a cover, resides in the Purple Tenuity Palace, corresponding to the imperial throne. The Three Terraces, six stars outside the Purple Tenuity Palace, regulate the harmony of yin and yang and the governance of the myriad things, likened to water and fire residing in the golden crucible above and below. If harmony and regulation are proper, the numinous essence descends within. The Three Terraces govern the records and administrations, leading the hundred officials, akin to the prime minister’s duty, also called Wenchang. If the five stars shrink or expand improperly, the sun and moon advance or retreat irregularly, the four seasons fail to respond, and wind and rain arrive untimely, causing the myriad things not to grow—this is like the adept refining the elixir who, if their operations are irregular, causes the crucible to dry or overflow, leading to constant anomalies and the failure of the elixir. If all seasonal nodes are mastered as if turning in the palm, the crucible is firmly sealed without mishap. If even one aspect is mismanaged, the competence of the fire’s application is scrutinized. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Wenchang governs the records; the terraces and assistants, the hundred officials and offices, each oversee their respective domains.\"\n\nMinister Dao’s Exegesis: Many in the world study the Dao, yet those who grasp its wondrous principles are one in ten thousand. Some feign its name to pursue illicit gain; some falsely claim to transmute yellow and white, engaging in alchemical deceptions. Others recklessly point to ancient texts, refining the five metals and eight minerals in hopes of fortuitously obtaining the great medicine, wasting years and exhausting spirit, yet achieving nothing. The foolish compound their errors; the wise diminish their conduct. They cling to delusion until death, never repenting, bewildered and entangled without end. Some lose their professions, squander their wealth, forfeit parental care, sever spousal love, drifting in hunger and cold—such cases span generations. Little do they know that the golden mother and great medicine are not crafted from common lead or mercury but are the spirit of Heaven and Earth, the souls of the sun and moon. How can one fail to enter its domain?\n\nChapter Twenty-Three: \"Fire Refines the Central Palace Earth\"\nFire refines the central palace earth; metal enters the northern water. Water, earth, and metal—three substances transform over sixty days, the essentials of natural generation and decay. If the fire count is excessive or the weights deviate, mercury may become unstable, dwelling apart or resisting harmony. Hard and soft contend, failing to interpenetrate—this is not fire’s fault but earth’s reprimand.\n\nMinister Dao’s Annotation: \"Fire refines the central palace earth; metal enters the northern water\" means fire is the sun, metal the moon. The two natures of metal and fire follow the qi of the five phases and six pitch-pipes to generate. Thus, fire generates earth, and metal generates water, each exhaling its essence to become the divine medicine. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The sun contains the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the discipline of the six pitch-pipes.\" \"Water, earth, and metal—three substances transform over sixty days\" describes how the central palace contains only the golden mother, while water and earth, two substances, harmonize through the fire’s timing. If in one month the fire’s timing does not align with the mother’s count, another month of firing is required. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Five times six makes thirty degrees; once completed, it begins anew.\" \"The essentials of natural generation and decay\" mean the golden liquid divine elixir entirely depends on the fire’s timing. Fire is the medicine’s parent; the medicine is fire’s progeny, naturally generated by the qi of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf the fire’s power is evenly maintained, it generates golden mercury; if the fire’s power is misaligned, it instead leads to dispersion and loss, with unpredictable preservation or decay—this must be measured within sixty days to determine its beginning and end. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"To trace the origin and grasp the end, to discern the threads of preservation and decay.\"\n\nIf the fire’s count is excessive or the weights deviate, when the yang fire’s count is too great, the spirit and qi are harmed, causing the golden mercury to overflow and overfill the crucible, violating the proper measure. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"If the lord grows arrogant and overbearing, he strays from the Dao.\"\n\nIf the mercury is unstable, now dwelling together, now apart, this mercury is the golden liquid. Should the fire’s count err, the mercury within the crucible chamber will follow the fire’s fluctuations, failing to adhere to the proper path—thus it may unite or separate unpredictably. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"If the minister is treacherous and perverse, his conduct does not follow the proper track.\"\n\nWhen hardness and softness contend without mutual penetration, the fault does not lie with the fire but is imputed to the earth. If the golden sand does not arise according to measure, hardness and softness fail to interpenetrate—not solely the fire’s error, but also because the central palace’s golden mother is impure, her essence and qi slightly lost. Thus, the fault is not ascribed to fire but to earth. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When the waxing and waning of the moon deviate, misfortune arises; the enforcer of the law reproaches and interrogates, blaming the ruler.\"\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: Those who refine the elixir must understand the movements of the sun and moon, comprehend the principles of yin and yang’s ascent and descent, grasp the withdrawal and addition of the fire’s timing, and distinguish the authenticity of medicinal substances—only then can success be assured. This truly depends on the person who regulates the fire’s timing. If one is ignorant of these matters and enforces the method inconsistently, blaming the inadequacy of the oral transmission or criticizing the master’s teachings without self-realization—those who cherish the Dao should take heed of this.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Earth Ruling the Central Palace**\n\nEarth rules the central palace, enveloping the four directions; the three luminaries align to bring great peace. The five viscera are internally nourished, the four limbs harmonized; water dries, fire extinguishes, inner radiance is contained, and brilliance shines within. Metal and wood mutually refine, their flow sealed; by regulating water and warming fire, all transform, and the Dao may be sought nearby.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: \"Earth rules the central palace, enveloping the four directions\"—earth is wu and ji, the mother. The mother resides in the central palace, summoning the harmonious qi of the four directions into the divine chamber to transform into the golden liquid. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The pole star stands at the center, like the golden mother, who can leisurely embrace all subjects.\" Thus it says: \"The pole star stands at the center, leisurely governing below.\"\n\n\"The three luminaries align to bring great peace\"—the three luminaries are the sun, moon, and stars. If the three luminaries advance and retreat without error above, the world below attains great peace, commands are executed, prohibitions upheld, and the state suffers no disorder. The internal operation of the elixir also possesses three luminaries: the yang fire, yin water, and golden embryo, which symbolize the sun, moon, and stars. Thus, the external operation also has three luminaries, distributed within the moving and static lines, the moments and breaths, the yin and yang symbols, and the fire’s timing. If the regulation of the symbols is correct, there will be no harm of escape—like governing a state to achieve great peace. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The bright hall enacts governance; the state suffers no harm—this is the Dao.\"\n\n\"The five viscera are internally nourished, the four limbs harmonized\"—if the regulation of the symbolic fire fully accords with the celestial degrees, then within the crucible chamber, the true person’s body, the five viscera and four limbs are harmonized and at peace, tranquil and empty, serene and desireless, attaining the center—thus there is no risk of premature death. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Internally, one nurtures oneself in stillness and emptiness.\"\n\n\"Water dries, fire extinguishes, inner radiance is contained\"—when refining the great elixir, at the *si* hour, water dries; at the *hai* hour, fire extinguishes. By these two hours, the essence and qi of metal and fire each attain their proper state, their brilliance pervading the chamber, illuminating the true person’s body. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Tracing the origin to its brightness, it illuminates the body within.\"\n\n\"Metal and wood mutually refine, their flow sealed\"—the qi of dragon and tiger intermingle, the natures of metal and wood harmonize. Metal comes to restrain wood; wood, though restrained by metal, becomes radiant, causing its brilliance to be sealed within the crucible, the numinous root enclosed in the chamber—all nurtured and transformed by the golden mother. The golden mother’s transformations are unfathomable; this subtlety is difficult to convey without oral transmission. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Seal its opening, fortify the numinous root.\"\n\n\"By regulating fire and warming water, all transform, and the Dao may be sought nearby\"—the golden mother within the crucible gathers the qi of the three luminaries and the essence of the sun and moon, giving birth to the sacred embryo, whose form is inscrutable. The numinous mercury of the child and root resides in the divine chamber, hidden and difficult to perceive. If the fire does not lose its timing and water does not lose its measure, water and fire both follow the Dao, ascending and descending according to principle, conforming to the celestial mechanism and the model of the law—then the golden mercury will naturally cherish the dragon and tiger’s natures, their essences intermingling. Seeking its transformations by analogy, the principle of the Dao becomes visible. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The three luminaries sink into obscurity; by warming and nurturing, the child-pearl is unseen—nearby and easily sought.\"\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: Human principles can be inferred by analogy. Before the essence of the three luminaries appears and the qi of the four images separates, the mysterious yellow is in chaos, clear and turbid undivided, the qi of true lead mixed within. Once the clear is used for heaven and the turbid for earth, the harmony of yin and yang forms humanity—thus the three powers are established. The qi of true lead resides in the center, at the position of wu and ji, becoming the mother of the divine medicine, enveloping the qi of metal, wood, water, and fire to congeal into the golden liquid. Among the five phases, metal comes to restrain wood; within wood is fire, which counter-restrains metal. Metal and fire mutually restrain, refining each other. Water comes to restrain fire; within fire is earth, which counter-restrains water. Water and earth mutually pair, transforming each other—this principle of mutual generation and restraint lies in oral transmission and cannot be written. If sought through the celestial Dao, it is merely a single taste of primordial harmony.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Water and Earth Alone Pairing**\n\nWater and earth alone pair; kingfishers give birth amidst auspicious clouds. The yellow and black blend the primordial essence; purple flowers unfold in the great yang. Water alone can generate the myriad things—only the sage knows this.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: \"Water and earth alone pair; kingfishers give birth amidst auspicious clouds\"—water is the mysterious water, earth is the golden mother. When the fire of the great yang unites with the golden mother, within the divine chamber, the essence of wood transforms into qi, giving rise to auspicious clouds, gradually congealing into flowing pearls that moisten the elixir palace to transform into the golden liquid. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The yellow center gradually opens; the principle moistens and reaches the skin.\"\n\nThe blending of yellow and black forms the primordial essence; purple flowers unfold in the great yang—yellow and black are also water and earth. When the qi of water and earth restrain each other, they generate the primordial essence of the great yang. If one harmonizes with the celestial patterns, comprehending their beginning and end to grasp their subtle principle, then the primordial essence of the great yang gradually manifests between existence and non-existence, giving rise to the *yinqie* and unfolding purple flowers, while the yellow liquid surges and swirls—this is the divine medicine before it solidifies. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When the beginning is correct, the end is cultivated; the stem is established, and the fruit may be held.\"\n\nThat water alone can generate the myriad things, and only the sage knows this—water is the first of the numbers, the mysterious heaven generates water, which resides in the north. Within water, metal is born, and metal in turn generates water. The sage, knowing this, models its image to refine the divine elixir, which the foolish and ignorant cannot fathom. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The One is used to conceal it; the world does not know.\"\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: The Qian and Kun, the two bodies, envelop the mysterious image. Heaven’s One generates water, called mysterious water; earth’s Five generates soil, called true earth. When water and earth unite, they give birth to the myriad things. The sage, understanding this transformation, models heaven and earth to establish the divine chamber, aligning with yin and yang to employ water and fire. Following the patterns of the hexagrams, traversing the four seasons, the primordial essence is born, and the divine mercury emerges.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Virtue of Metal Prefers White**\nThe virtue of metal prefers white; refining lead seeks the yellow hue. Through resonance, it generates within the central palace, where yellow gold melts without flying, and scorched earth gives rise to clouds of smoke.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: \"The virtue of metal prefers white; refining lead seeks the yellow hue\"—refining lead produces white metal, and white metal forms the divine chamber. Within the divine chamber lies metal-water, which, transformed by fire, changes its color to yellow, called the Yellow Chariot. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Below lies the qi of the great yang, steaming for a moment; first it liquefies, then congeals, named the Yellow Chariot.\"\n\n\"Through resonance, it generates within the central palace, where yellow gold melts without flying, and scorched earth gives rise to clouds of smoke\"—as the golden liquid is about to form, it congeals with water and fire within the vessel. Originating from metal, it transforms into liquid, resonating and coalescing in the central palace, so the liquid of yellow gold naturally does not escape. Fire scorches the golden essence, and the pure qi becomes clear and luminous, sometimes manifesting as light smoke or thin mist within the crucible chamber, its transformations boundless. It may resemble stalactites hanging inverted, or interlocking canine teeth; it may take the form of the sun and moon, revealing both hun and po, or transform into the shapes of dragons and tigers, where metal and water unite, and spirits manifest in myriad forms beyond description. If one were to use the five metals, eight stones, or various other杂 substances to create this, how could such divine transformations be attained?\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: Among all things in the world, only yellow gold cannot be destroyed. Since the beginning of creation, only the body of metal remains undiminished. Thus, the mother of yellow gold is called true lead. True lead is the One of pre-heaven; before the separation of chaos, the qi of lead resided within it. When heaven and earth took form, the body of lead also appeared. If the myriad things lacked the qi of lead, they could not achieve their wondrous functions. Therefore, the qi of true lead is omnipresent.\n\nMoreover, black metal generates white metal, white metal generates yellow metal, and yellow metal generates the supreme medicine. If one ingests it, one’s lifespan aligns with heaven and earth, and one’s body merges with the Dao. Thus, the essence of metal’s virtue is the master of all medicines and the origin of the myriad things.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Existence and Non-Existence Mutually Restrain**\nExistence and non-existence mutually restrain; above dwells the Green Dragon, residing in the two non-existences’ origin. The One’s numinous transformation is wondrous and difficult to perceive.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: \"Existence and non-existence mutually restrain; above dwells the Green Dragon\"—existence refers to white metal, and non-existence refers to the qi of fire. Thus, existence and non-existence interact, mutually restraining and uniting metal and water to generate the numinous mercury within the central palace. Mercury is the Green Dragon. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When the upper is closed, it is called existence; when the lower is closed, it is called non-existence. Non-existence serves to uphold the upper, where the divine power resides.\"\n\n\"The two non-existences’ origin, the One’s numinous transformation is wondrous and difficult to perceive\"—the two non-existences are the qi of yin and yang, the hun and po of the sun and moon. The One’s existence is also the divine embryo. Within the divine embryo, there are no杂 substances, only an empty vessel. Through the qi of water and fire, it draws the essence of the sun and moon, uniting the purest of yin and yang to enter the divine embryo. The numinous transformation of the golden liquid is beyond perception. Above and below the divine chamber, the qi of water and fire, through the nurturing of the metal mother, mutually require each other to generate. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"These two apertures follow the method; the qi of metal also mutually requires this.\"\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: The golden liquid, named the Yellow Chariot, is the name of the ninefold transmutation. The ancients, when ingesting the elixir, first purified themselves through fasting and inner clarity, then consumed the outer elixir, so that inner and outer were both perfected. The true qi steamed and suffused the four limbs, reversing aging to return to youth, becoming a body of pure yang, and attaining a lifespan equal to heaven.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Refining Silver from Lead**\nRefining silver from lead, the divine substance generates itself. Silver is the essence of metal; lead envelops the northern numen. Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named the One, the beginning of yin and yang. Thus, it harbors silver’s essence, and lead transforms into yellow cinnabar, residing among the five metals as lead. Externally black, it embodies the north’s direction; internally, it harbors metal’s essence, clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade—outwardly a madman.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: \"Refining silver from lead, the divine substance generates itself\"—white metal has not yet revealed its form, concealed within the northern mysterious water. If one knows how to extract the great medicine’s foundation from within white metal and black lead, and moves according to the celestial patterns, then the divine substance will naturally generate. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Know the white, guard the black, and the divine illumination will come of itself.\"\n\n\"Silver is the essence of metal; lead envelops the northern numen\"—the essence of metal is white metal, and the foundation of mysterious water is true lead. It constantly envelops the true mercury of the northern water. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water.\"\n\n\"Water is the pivot of the Dao, the beginning of yin and yang, thus harboring silver’s essence\"—white metal is born from water and used as a divine vessel. The body of water is inexhaustible, and the mutual affinity of metal and water serves as the pivot, the root of yin and yang. Thus, it is the essence of silver, and the essence of silver is the medicine. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named the One, the beginning of yin and yang.\"\n\n\"Lead transforms into yellow cinnabar, residing among the five metals\"—lead is also called the mysterious position, residing in the Kan direction. The qi of water, fire, metal, and wood converge within lead, making it the master of the five metals and eight stones. When flowing pearls encounter it, they take root, all formed by the congealing of water and fire’s qi. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The mysterious contains the yellow sprout, the master of the five metals, the northern river chariot.\"\n\n\"Lead is externally black, embodying the north, internally harboring silver’s essence\"—lead’s exterior is black and coarse, yet within it lies the golden essence, constantly residing in the northern Ren and Gui positions.\n\nAs the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Thus lead is externally black yet internally harbors golden essence.\" \"Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade, outwardly a madman\"—before true lead is stabilized through refinement, it lies concealed within ore, its black exterior enveloping inner brilliance, akin to one robed in humble garb yet bearing treasure. The *Cantong Qi* declares: \"Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade, outwardly a madman,\" precisely this meaning.\n\nThe *Chendao Shu* explains: The crucible is the elixir; the elixir is the crucible. Crucible and elixir are one. If the Way of golden liquor could be accomplished without minerals, then those who ingested it would ascend as immortals in great numbers. Thus the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Cast aside the eight stones of Wudu, discard them\"—from this we know the great elixir employs neither the five metals nor the eight stones, nor malachite, realgar, or cinnabar. As for those golden elixirs that turn from red to purple, they are merely tainted by the qi of malachite or realgar. Moreover, when the primordial qi of nature generates the branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits of plants, their vibrant hues—are these dyed by malachite or realgar? An ancient poem says:\n\n*How wondrous the blooming flower,*\n*Red buds amid green leaves—*\n*Who has dyed them thus?*\n*Know that Creation’s fire*\n*Kindles stems and branches,*\n*Flowers and leaves unfurling—*\n*All transformations wrought by water, fire, and earth’s qi.*\n\nThe Way of the golden elixir is likewise: following the principle of Heaven and Earth’s generation, uniting the natural methods of metal and wood, if water, fire, and earth are gathered into one household, how could there be no transformation? Among the myriad arts, some employ the five metals, eight stones, saltpeter, alum, copper powder, and other minerals, yet for the numinous liquor of gold and mercury, such minerals have no application. If those who refine the great elixir comprehend this profound mystery of the Dao and the true lead’s place of origin, then the golden liquor will unfailingly form. Thus the Perfected Liu Zhigu states: \"Dragon and tiger are gold and mercury. When golden liquor enfolds them, attaining their natural nature, how could its ingestion not be wondrous?\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Silver as the Mother of Lead**\nSilver is the mother of lead; the mother resides within lead. Lead is the child of silver; the child conceals the silver’s womb. Ethereal and distant, it seems both present and absent. In the ash pool, with blazing heat, lead sinks while silver floats, pure and white, revealing the treasure that can forge the yellow chariot.\n\nThe *Chendao* annotation states: \"Silver is the mother of lead; the mother resides within lead\"—silver is metal, lead is water. Water is born from metal, and metal in turn conceals its form within lead-water. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Metal is the mother of water; the mother nurtures the child’s embryo,\" precisely this.\n\n\"Lead is the child of silver; the child conceals the silver’s womb\"—silver is the child, water; lead is the mother, metal. Since metal generates water, the child-water again dwells within the lead-mother, hence called black lead. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Water is the child of metal; the child conceals the mother’s womb,\" precisely this. After black lead transforms in quality, it lodges in the west, ever tracing its path within water, where it receives water’s nourishment and increasingly manifests its generative power. Named black lead, when refined into white metal and made into a divine chamber, the yang fire’s stimulation causes the child-water to flow forth from the white metal, called true mercury.\n\nGreat indeed! This true substance is the one qi that generates Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe true essence, vast and distant, seems both present and absent—this is the true essence, the true mercury. Within the mother’s womb, pressed and pursued by external signs, it flickers between existence and non-existence, rising and sinking without constancy. Concealed by the crucible-chamber, its form and appearance cannot be seen. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"The true person’s utmost subtlety is as if present, as if absent,\" precisely this.\n\nIn the ash-pool, flames scorch: lead sinks, silver floats. The ash-pool’s fire blazes, lead sinks below, silver rises above—called white metal. The *True One’s Child* says: The true mercury within the divine crucible, steamed and fumigated by yang fire and yin signs, flies and hides without constancy, now sinking, now floating. The divine chamber is like a great abyss. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Vaguely resembling a great abyss, now sinking, now floating,\" precisely this.\n\nPure white, the treasure appears—it can be fashioned into the yellow chariot. The ash-pool forges and refines it into white metal; taking white metal to make the divine chamber, one can craft the yellow chariot. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Gather it when white, fashion it to become vermilion,\" precisely this.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao in Exposition* says: The essence of golden liquid lies in the divine water, the flower-pool—the flower-pool is the mother of metal. Metal is the white metal of the west; within this metal is liquid mercury. The radiant pearl of the Great Yang and these two substances, though each has its form, share a single source. The perfected person nurtures the metal and mercury, transforming them into cinnabar—this is returning to the root and reverting to the source, restoring the nature of spontaneity. The white metal, divine mother, nurtures the great elixir. Once the great elixir is formed, its fluids never cease, hence called golden liquid. Those who cherish the Dao must examine and scrutinize this carefully. One cannot simply mix mountain silver and mercury and call it \"nurturing mercury.\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The Shell Becomes Metal-Essence**\nThe shell becomes metal-essence; water returns as yellow liquid. A substance the width of an inch blends the Three Powers. Before Heaven and Earth divided, its form resembled a chicken’s egg.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao in Annotation* says: \"The shell becomes metal-essence; water returns as yellow liquid\"—true lead is refined into white metal, and white metal is made into the crucible-vessel, the mother of metal-essence. Within it lies mercury, which can transform into yellow liquid. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Refined to become its outer defense, white within, the true resides,\" precisely this.\n\n\"A substance the width of an inch blends the Three Powers\"—the divine chamber is hollow, square or round, slightly over an inch. The upper cauldron is Heaven, the lower cauldron is Earth, and within, the numinous mercury embodies the Three Powers. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Square and round, an inch in width, blending and supporting one another,\" precisely this.\n\n\"Before Heaven and Earth divided, its form resembled a chicken’s egg\"—before Heaven and Earth opened, the primordial chaos was like the shape of a chicken’s egg. The essence of the sun and moon intertwined within it, and the forms of the myriad phenomena began to emerge. The perfected person points to the divine chamber, symbolizing the primordial chaos, to embody the function of the Three Powers. Advancing yang fire and withdrawing yin signs, they retain the essence of the sun and moon. True lead existed before Heaven and Earth; gathering it has its method, crafting it has its principle—it cannot be done recklessly. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and revered,\" precisely this.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao in Exposition* says: Once white metal is revealed, it resembles white horse’s teeth. Its nature delights in consuming the essence of wood, for wood is born from the water of the north. After forging and refining, it becomes pure as snow—truly the treasure of the elixir. Master Tao says: \"Refine treasure with treasure; the aspirant attains the Dao.\" Ge Zhichuan says: \"Stone liquid, demon liquid, metal-essence, mountain treasures\"—examining this, it is also \"pure white, the treasure appears.\" Since it is called pure white and also called the treasure, it can be used to craft the golden liquid divine elixir. Today’s people burn cinnabar and mercury; even if they master the method of subduing fire, their fundamental nature remains. Though they may ingest it, how can cinnabar enter the five viscera and disperse like mist, wind, and rain?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Rising High at the Center**\nRising high at the center, its form resembles Penglai. The gates are subtly sealed, the numinous operates within. The furnace and hearth take their form from solid density and complete firmness, bending and restraining one another to ensure no mishap. This is the principle of spontaneity, the divine transformation without limit.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao in Annotation* says: \"Rising high at the center, its form resembles Penglai\"—in cultivating the great elixir, one must first arrange the altar, furnace, crucible, and hearth, upper and lower connected like the form of Penglai. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Beside it lies a level expanse, resembling Penglai,\" precisely this.\n\n\"The gates are subtly sealed, the numinous operates within\"—the crucible’s interior is circular and open on all sides to receive the fire’s qi. The gates are tightly sealed to prevent any loss. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Encircling, sealing, open on all sides, hesitating,\" precisely this.\n\n\"The furnace and hearth take their form from solid density and complete firmness\"—on the altar is the furnace, on the furnace is the hearth, in the hearth is the crucible, in the crucible is the divine chamber, and within the divine chamber, metal and water envelop one another to block evil and allow the numinous mercury to arise easily. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Guard and defend, solid and dense, blocking evil,\" precisely this.\n\n\"Bending and restraining one another to ensure no mishap\"—the metal crucible hangs within the hearth, its four sides hollowed to disperse the fire’s qi. Water is placed above the metal crucible, fire is moved below the metal crucible, and the altar, furnace, crucible, and hearth envelop one another to prevent accidents. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Curving and joining, connected to guard against mishap,\" precisely this.\n\n\"This is the principle of spontaneity, the divine transformation without limit\"—in crafting the great medicine, all are the essence of the sun, moon, and stars, the qi of the Five Phases and Four Images, becoming golden liquid—there is no other Dao.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao in Exposition* says: The perfected person pities those who do not know the Dao, drowning in profit and rushing toward death, unaware of where the numinous goes or where the nature resides. This is why the essence of golden liquid is transmitted. Even the Yellow Emperor and Laozi practiced this Dao, becoming teachers for later generations. Those who ingest the elixir achieve long life, soaring and transforming, entering fire without burning, entering water without soaking—this is it. The rulers who governed before the Yellow Emperor all mastered this Dao, passing it down in succession—not only those who wandered beyond the world pursued this path.\n\nLater generations grew shallow and impure, the method became quite secret, and those who obtained it were rare. By the Zhou dynasty, Laozi descended into the world to cross the Pass, first bestowing the method of golden liquid solely upon the Pass Guardian, the Perfected Yin. From then on, it spread through the world. Those with karmic affinity encounter it and pass it down in succession, unbroken. The seed of the Dao—today’s people are otherwise: wealth and nobility make them arrogant, fame and profit enslave their nature, wine and excess stifle their qi, lust and desire confuse their emotions. Beyond the four pleasures, they fear only death. Thus, they recklessly seek to prolong life, paying homage to masters of arts and techniques in pursuit of the medicine of immortality. Hearing of this, those with devious motives rush in, acting haughtily as if they were masters, remaining silent and secretive, treating the profound as something to be concealed, causing chaos and making the truth difficult to discern. They take peripheral and minor arts, falsely claiming them as the supreme Dao, and borrow the names of minerals, plants, and trees to pass off as true medicine—yet they achieve no effect. That later generations do not believe in the method of golden liquid is hardly surprising.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Lodestone Attracts Iron**\n\nThe lodestone attracts iron, its influence penetrating barriers in hidden communion—how much more so when the egg’s pairing gives birth? The virtue of metal and earth ever abides with mercury.\n\nYour servant Dao annotates: The lodestone’s power, though whole, can draw several catties of iron beyond vessels—this is the mutual resonance of things. As the *Cantong Qi* states: *\"The profound and distant, though separated by barriers, remain connected.\"* As for the egg’s pairing giving birth: crafting a divine chamber from white metal to resemble an egg’s form, like the union of Heaven and Earth, moving water and fire so that numinous mercury is born. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Like an egg, black and white support each other.\"* Moreover, within Heaven and Earth there is the Great Yin’s mysterious essence, transforming myriad forms and infusing all things above. Whether great or small, none exist without it. The perfected refine and consume it to arrest the light and cultivate immortality.\n\nThe method to refine it relies solely on white metal, whose power alone can restrain it, allowing it to linger and solidify into transformation. The virtue of metal and earth ever dwells with mercury: metal is Qian, earth is Kun. When Qian and Kun stir in emotion, mercury and lead are born, uniting as golden liquid without fleeing. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Movement and stillness, rest and activity, ever accompany man.\"*\n\nYour servant Dao elucidates: The ancient perfected ones’ profound methods lay in refining the golden crucible. If one can comprehend this, one may summon the qi of myriad transformations and know the essence of golden liquid. Suppose, before the primordial chaos, when form and substance were undivided, the state of Heaven and Earth resembled an egg—grasping its root and establishing it as the supreme Dao. Thus, before Heaven and Earth, at the origin of the myriad things, this art was the first attained. Those who obtain it stand alone for eternity, their spirit and form uncorrupted—this is hardly difficult.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Fire Record Is No False Composition**\n\nThe Fire Record is no false composition, nor does it redundantly reiterate previous texts. Since the elixir arts are already expounded, they are not repeated here; thus, this formula is appended to the Fire Record.\n\nYour servant Dao annotates: The Fire Record is no false composition, nor does it redundantly reiterate previous texts. The Fire Record comprises six hundred chapters, sequentially arranged to operate the ten-month fire regimen. Each month has thirty days, with a hexagram for day and night, totaling sixty hexagrams—ten months thus yield six hundred hexagrams. The second and eighth months also have chapters, but since the third month’s water stabilizes metal and the tenth month’s fire ceases water, they align with the first and seventh months, hence not included in the count. This is the ancient text of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*, where the Fire Record was transmitted orally by the ancients—no false composition, thus emphasized. As the elixir method states: *\"The medicine is transmitted, not the fire.\"* Since the Fire Record was composed earlier, it is not restated in this scripture, and this formula is appended to it. This scripture was transmitted solely through ancient texts, without recording the author’s name. The ancients who attained the Dao feared the Fire Record would be lost, leaving later generations unable to refine the golden liquid, so they composed this scripture to append to it.\n\nYour servant Dao elucidates: Those who study the Dao in this world fail to grasp the root of golden liquid and cling to peripheral paths, wasting their lives in vain. Some sit rigidly, visualizing, swallowing saliva, inhaling breath, pointing to the Great Abyss as a single aperture, imagining the cinnabar field below the navel, or silently listening for numinous sounds, dividing them into lead and mercury, uniting heart and kidney as water and fire—these are but the studies of beginners. Others practice bedroom arts of qi absorption and supplementation, exchanging yin and yang, exhaling and inhaling, refining inner elixirs—yet as their blood and qi deplete, they invite calamity, their decaying forms turning to dust. Such misguided paths are numerous, all straying from the Dao, advancing yet retreating, hastening yet delaying, obscuring the utmost truth and violating Heaven’s principle. Viewed thus, they are deeply pitiable.\n\nThis scripture begins with the dragon and tiger: the dragon is the sun, the tiger is the moon. Sun and moon are the ancestors of Qian and Kun’s movement, the root of the myriad things’ birth. Qian is the metal body of Heaven, its color azure-green, containing yin and yang, harmonizing the four images, the three luminaries, and the two qi, all operating within it. The ancients emulated Heaven and Earth’s movement, the sun and moon’s separation and union, establishing the furnace and crucible, gathering the light of the two luminaries, summoning the dragon and tiger’s qi into the divine chamber, refining it into medicine, called the golden elixir—hence the name *Dragon-Tiger*. Master Wei said: *\"The dragon’s spirit sings where the spring’s light clouds weave the sky; the tiger’s roar stirs the void’s rushing wind. The yang burning-mirror shines, crimson fire rises; the yin dew-receiver reveals the mysterious overflow—all occurs naturally.\"*\n\nThe Way of the golden elixir’s transformations is fundamentally one. If one relies on the five metals, eight stones, various lead ores, or visualizations to gather inner elixirs, hoping to ascend in broad daylight, is this not difficult? Moreover, this scripture’s three chapters contain vulgar and coarse language, with some characters incorrect—all later additions under false names. I have excised them, aligning with Master Wei’s *Cantong Qi* to divide it into thirty-three chapters, so later scholars may follow its sequence without error.\n\nThough the mountains and forests harbor lofty recluses, and the court and markets teem with great talents, can there be no hope for those who deeply cultivate the Dao, verifying it against the *Cantong Qi*?\n\n**Ancient Text of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*, Annotated and Elucidated, Volume Three**\n**Fire Regimen of the Great Elixir in the *Cantong Qi***\n**Diagram of the Gathered Celestial Fire Regimen**\n\nGather the celestial fire regimen to align with years, months, days, and hours, following yin and yang to withdraw and add water and fire, so the dragon’s essence gradually descends within the crucible, and the golden liquid flows smoothly within the womb.\n\n**Fire Regimen of the Celestial Cycle**\nThe mechanism most vital to the golden elixir:\nWithin the year, follow the moon’s changes;\nWithin the day, shift with the hours’ movement.\nThe four seasons share the same process,\nThe three spirits seem to possess knowledge.\nThe true secret of fire and metal—\nWhat else can be applied beyond this?\n\n**Fire Regimen of the Great Elixir in the *Cantong Qi***\n**Diagram of Metal and Fire Intermingling to Generate Medicine**\n\n**Daily Fire and Monthly Metal: The Convergence of Yin and Yang**\n\nSun’s fire and moon’s metal unite in the darkness of night,\nTheir essences intertwined to generate the myriad things.\nA month’s cycle concludes, then begins anew,\nSince the dawn of creation, endlessly revolving.\n\nWater and fire intermingle to nurture,\nSprouts blossom forth in fragrance.\nGolden radiance descends upon Mao’s stars,\nThe Jade Hare appears within the Heart Chamber.\nThe waning spirit begins with *xin*,\nThe soul retreats into the *gen* realm.\nThe Dao concludes in five and six,\nThe *Fu* hexagram unfolds once more.\n\n**Postscript to the *Annotated and Expanded Classic of the Dragon and Tiger***\nComposed by the Perfected One, Peng Xiao\n\nThe *Golden Key* states: When I first divided and analyzed the chapters and meanings of the *Cantong Qi*, I chanced upon an old text and perused the *Songs of the Perfected One of Mount Tai Bai*. Thereupon, I resolved to compose two essays—*Black Lead, the Water Tiger* and *Red Lead, the Fire Dragon*—the essence of which declares:\n\nBlack lead, the water tiger, is the root of heaven and earth’s generation, possessing both form and qi. Red lead, the fire dragon, is the origin of heaven and earth’s generation, possessing qi yet devoid of form. These two principles are immutable truths for all eternity.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Dao, that which has form is not the nine-and-one arts of the yin path—five metals, eight stones, saltpeter, frost, dew, or nectar. That which is formless is not the methods of the six desires, seven emotions, sitting in oblivion, or the visualization of the Three Ones. Thus, the ancients said: That which has form is true lead, the essence of the Grand Yin moon, the mother that nurtures the forms of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. That which is formless is true mercury, the light of the Grand Yang sun, the father that generates heaven, earth, and the myriad things. These two bodies, lead and mercury, mutually engender and cycle without end, truly the ancestors that give birth to heaven, earth, and all things.\n\nTherefore, perfected ones and superior scholars spare no effort in gathering the essence of the Grand Yin, devising symbolic methods to guide the qi of the Grand Yang into the divine chamber, where it coalesces into the divine elixir of golden liquid. The essence of the Grand Yin is the golden blossom, the yellow sprout. The qi of the Grand Yang is the flowing pearl, the enchanting maiden. Thus, the scripture states: *\"The flowing pearl of the Grand Yang ever seeks to depart; only when it encounters the golden blossom does it turn and remain.\"* It also says: *\"The enchanting maiden by the river is numinous and most divine. To restrain her, the yellow sprout must serve as her root.\"* The flowing pearl and enchanting maiden are of restless nature, prone to flight. Without the crucible’s vessel and the skillful summoning of methods, how could they idly abide upon杂物?\n\nThus, in crafting the great elixir, one must first refine true lead, modeling the divine chamber after heaven and earth. The upper crucible symbolizes heaven, the male, *qian*, *li*, the sun, fire, yang, and wood. The lower crucible symbolizes earth, the female, *kun*, *kan*, the moon, water, yin, and metal. When the two crucibles unite, they resemble an egg, their hollow interior spanning slightly over an inch to house the numinous mercury. Here, *kun* is the mother, the metal wife; *qian* is the father, the wood husband. Once the fire dragon unites beneath the divine chamber, the metal tiger’s essence converges within, their coupling unceasing, their progeny boundless. From wood arises the hun-soul, from metal the po-spirit. Hun and po congeal into qi, gradually forming the *yine* and *e*, their intermingling producing the flowing pearl, called the golden liquid. Thus, the ancient song says:\n\n*\"Bind the body, gather the po to sate the tiger’s hunger;\nThe tiger comes to feed, consuming marrow and fat.\"*\nMarrow and fat are the golden liquid.\n\nOne must also seek a numinous mountain or blessed land to construct the elixir chamber, erect a stellar altar, install the furnace and hearth, and cast the crucible chamber. Only when true companions gather and all guidelines are meticulously observed can one proceed with this endeavor. Thus, Master Zhen Yi, in his postscript to the *Cantong Qi*, states: *\"The adept must thoroughly relinquish fame and profit, sever worldly ties, retreat to a numinous mountain, and secretly cultivate with like-minded immortals, diligently practicing day and night. Only then may success be hoped for. Otherwise, one’s efforts will be in vain.\"*\n\nMaster Yin Zhen said: *\"Without the proper ground, do not act rashly. One must be discreet, cautious, and guarded, preserving the celestial mechanism. This medicine’s transformations are beyond comprehension.\"* He also said: *\"Do not waver in success or failure; with single-minded devotion, refine the returning elixir. Can this be empty words to delude later generations?\"*\n\nI, Dao, have encountered a teacher and followed his guidance for many years. Yet, burdened by a minor official post, a humble home, meager salary, and the entanglements of worldly affairs—compounded by a growing household—I have drifted to this point without the means to proceed. Nevertheless, my resolve has not faltered; my heart grows ever firmer. I await only a favorable wind to ultimately accomplish this task.\n\nThe nineteen fire-regimen diagrams are all included at the end of the lower volume of the *Cantong Qi*; they are not reproduced here. Only the *Diagram of the Gathered Celestial Fire Regimen* and the *Diagram of Metal and Fire Intermingling to Generate Medicine* are appended to this text, clarifying the dragon and tiger’s movements and verifying the mysterious workings of metal and wood.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the third month in the *yisi* year, I, Dao, was mistakenly summoned by the reigning emperor to discuss the arts of nurturing life and cultivating nature. I respectfully presented my annotations on the *Classic of the Dragon and Tiger* and my supplementary explanations of the *Cantong Qi*, offering my responses. I was graced with the emperor’s jade-like instructions, discoursing on lofty principles at length, fortunately without error or oversight. This was a thousand lifetimes’ blessing from a past existence. In the fourth month of that same year, I was entrusted with an official post in the Imperial Pharmacy, basking in the favor of imperial light. Having completed the transcription and presentation of my annotations on the *Classic of the Dragon and Tiger*, I, a distant and lowly figure, dared not presume to annotate and expand such texts—my transgression is unforgivable. Yet, thanks to the sagely sovereign’s forbearance, I was not immediately dismissed. Upon reviewing my errors, the emperor deemed me worthy of life beyond death.\n\nIn my supplementary annotations to the *Cantong Qi*, the explanations are somewhat extensive, and I was unable to present them simultaneously. Constrained by my meager salary and lack of resources, I could not transcribe them to reach the imperial gaze. My reverent heart yearns for the throne, yet I have no means to ascend. Later, I made several revisions and additions. I have now carefully transcribed them separately and commissioned their carving into woodblocks, hoping they may circulate among like-minded practitioners. If encountered, they may serve as a preliminary guide.\n\nSome may say: *\"The original text of the *Classic of the Dragon and Tiger* is profound and abstruse; it cannot be lightly discussed. Your annotations, sir, are crude and shallow—how can they be accurate?\"* To this, I reply: Since my youth, I have devoted myself to studying texts without respite. Now, at fifty-six, I have encountered a luminous teacher and oral instructions, which I have not failed to refine diligently. If I were to deceive later generations with falsehoods, how could I dare to betray the radiant heavens above?",

      "translated_text": "The *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n**Masters Section, Volume 14**\n*Annotated Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic*\n**Daoist School**\n**Abstract**\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully observe: The *Annotated Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic* in three juan was composed by Wang Dao of the Song dynasty. It is prefaced by the author’s own preface and a memorial from Zhou Zhenyi, a Daoist of the Taiyi Palace, submitting the work for imperial consideration, followed by a postscript by the author. Wang Dao’s origins remain unverifiable; he styled himself \"Bao Yi Lang, Acting Commander of the Prince of Enping’s Residence,\" and in his preface described himself as \"a mere military officer serving in the princely household.\" Thus, he was originally a palace guard of the princely establishment who later attached himself to the Daoist tradition.\n\nChen Zhensun’s *Bibliographic Notes with Explanations* records the *Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Upper Classic* in one juan, unattributed to any author. Wang Dao expanded upon its meaning with annotations and further elucidated his intent through supplementary explanations. The *Classic* is divided into thirty-three chapters: thirteen in the upper juan, six in the middle, and fourteen in the lower. At the end are appended two diagrams—*\"Gathering the Celestial Fire Phases\"* and *\"Gold and Fire Intermingling to Generate the Elixir\"*—to clarify the method of practice. The main annotations assert that true lead and true mercury are but the essence of Heaven and Earth and the radiance of the sun and moon, harmonized to emulate creation and refine the divine elixir. They distinguish the authenticity of medicinal ingredients and resolve the differences among minerals. The author also claims to have received the true oral instructions of a master, noting that the circulated versions of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* contained many errors, which he corrected by reorganizing the text into chapters and fixing the phrasing. During the Chunxi era, he submitted the work for imperial review, explaining that \"Dragon-Tiger\" signifies the meaning of water and fire—a conventional metaphor in Daoist alchemical texts.\n\nThe annotations and explanations frequently cite the *Cantong Qi*, for the discourse on furnace and fire originated with Wei Boyang, whose work remains the \"Six Classics\" of that tradition. Wang Dao also wrote a *Detailed Annotation of the Cantong Qi*, as mentioned in his postscript, though this work is now lost. Its general purport, however, was likely similar to the present text.\n\nThis book is not listed in the *Bibliographic Treatise* of the *History of the Song Dynasty*, leading some to suspect it was forged by Daoist practitioners. Yet, as the antiquity of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* itself remains unverified, there is little need to investigate the authenticity of the annotations. Moreover, the practices of breath cultivation and life nurturing belong to the reclusive traditions of mountain forests—why, then, would a court alchemist submit such a work to the throne? The man himself is hardly worthy of note; we preserve this text merely because its arguments are coherent.",

      "translated_text": "In the third month of the forty-fourth year of the Qianlong reign, respectfully submitted after collation.\n\n**Chief Compilers:**\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collator:**\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n---\n\n**Original Preface to the *Annotated and Exegetical Commentary on the Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic***\n\nYour servant Dao states: The learning of the Daoist school encompasses what is called \"inner elixir\" and \"outer elixir,\" which are truly bound to the essence of life and destiny. Those who attain them achieve, in small measure, the preservation of vitality and extension of years, and in great measure, transcendence into immortality and sagehood. Their disciples have transmitted writings to the world, numbering no fewer than ten thousand scrolls. For the inner elixir, none fail to take spirit and qi as their foundation; for the outer elixir, none fail to take lead and mercury as their origin. An ancient song says:\n\n*Red lead, black mercury—head of the great elixir,*\n*When matched in harmony, true cultivation begins.*\n*Red lead draws essence, black draws marrow;*\n*Resolve this duality, and the medicine is peerless.*\n*Merge red into black to preserve long life;*\n*Use black in red, and you ascend as a celestial immortal.*\n*Inverted, these two form the elixir—*\n*Fire and dragon transform into celestial immortals.*\n\nThis is the essential method of the outer elixir.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, those who study the Dao have all regarded lead and mercury as the great elixir medicine, yet they know not what true lead and true mercury truly are. Since my youth, I have delighted in hearing of such matters, collecting alchemical texts and pondering their meaning day and night, even forgetting sleep and food. Yet these were but words on paper, never elucidated. In the *ren-shen* year of the Shaoxing reign, a Daoist told me that true lead was but the silver ore mined from mountains and stones, and true mercury was the liquid quicksilver extracted from cinnabar. He instructed me to obtain about a catty of each, refine them in a crucible with fire, and await the result. I believed him and thus established a laboratory in the Tianqing Abbey of Guiji, following his instructions to test the method. Years passed, wealth was expended, yet no success was achieved—not because my heart lacked sincerity, but because the method itself was flawed.\n\nIn the *jia-shen* year of the Qiandao reign, another Daoist told me that true lead does not reveal its form, and true mercury does not manifest its shape. He further said: \"True lead is not silver, true cinnabar is not mercury. Combine these two, divide them into nine portions, and refine them in a tripod with fire to obtain the *Yellow Sprout*. When refined by method, it transforms into *Yellow Chariot* and *Purple Powder*, also called *Dust of the Bright Window*. Ingesting it gathers essence, collects spirit, and eradicates all illness.\" In my view, this was merely the *Central Elixir* once concocted by Qingxiazi. Not until the *gui-si* year of the Chunxi reign did I encounter a true master, who enabled me to realize that all I had previously obtained was not true lead or true mercury.\n\nAn ancient song says:\n\n*True lead is not born within the five metals,*\n*It arises in the profound depths before heaven and earth.*\n*Another says:*\n*The sage seizes the intent of creation,*\n*Hand-gripping sun and moon, placing them in the crucible.*\n*Gently, the essence of heaven and earth ascends;*\n*Gathered, yin and yang converge—*\n*Spirit and demon, sun’s soul and moon’s spirit.*\n*Whoever recognizes this is a true immortal.*\n*Refine and ingest it for over a thousand days,*\n*And the body, free of yin, cannot die.*\n\nThe true master transmitted to me his secret formula and oral instructions, and in that moment, I awakened as from a dream. Thereafter, I read the books of all schools, and none failed to align; all became clear and luminous. From this, I knew that the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit are true lead and true mercury—arising from formlessness to generate numinous substance. The movement and stillness of the myriad things all proceed from them. If one establishes the crucible, erects the tripod, constructs the divine chamber, and harmonizes the root of sun and moon, mastering the transformations of water and fire without losing the celestial tally, then the great medicine and divine elixir may be obtained.\n\nOver thirty years, I encountered three teachers, and only with the true master did I finally grasp the wondrous Dao. Your servant is but a lowly military officer, serving in a princely household, with meager salary and humble means. I could not gather true companions, procure elixir materials, cast crucibles, construct the divine chamber, or retreat to the mountains and forests to pursue this path. Yet I have focused my heart and will, never forgetting it day or night. Recently, during a moment of leisure, I examined the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* as it circulates in the world and found its errors to be numerous. Thus, I employed what I received from the true master to correct and refine it, dividing it into chapters and verses, composing annotations. I further used the *Cantong Qi* of Wei Boyang to verify its meaning, expanding it into an exegesis to distinguish the authenticity of medicinal materials, the differences among metals and minerals, and to eliminate redundancy while extracting essentials, ensuring coherence from beginning to end. I compiled it into one work of three scrolls: the first scroll contains thirteen chapters, the second six, and the third fourteen, totaling thirty-three chapters. I dare not transmit this to later generations but merely present it to fellow Daoist friends of like aspiration.\n\nYour servant, a man of rustic remoteness, knows no taboos. With reckless audacity and a thousand deaths’ worth of trepidation, I have, through the verification of the eminent scholar Zhou Zhenyi, transcribed and respectfully submitted this work. I humbly pray that in Your Majesty’s moments of leisure, You might deign to peruse it, granting me the once-in-a-millennium fortune of fulfilling my lifelong aspiration. This is not merely my private wish but also the entrusted charge of the true master.\n\nWritten on the first day of the fourth month in the fourteenth year of the Chunxi reign.\n\nYour servant, the *Baoyi* Lang, Wang Dao, with utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground a hundred times and respectfully presents this preface.\n\n---\n\n**Original Preface to the *Annotated and Exegetical Commentary on the Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic***\n\n**Memorial Submitting the *Annotated and Exegetical Commentary on the Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic***\n\nYour servant Zhenyi respectfully observes: The *Annotated and Exegetical Commentary on the Dragon-Tiger Classic* in three scrolls, composed by the *Baoyi* Lang Wang Dao, presents matters with clarity and directness, elucidates principles with depth and detail, and profoundly captures the esoteric meaning of the *Cantong Qi* and *Jinbi Jing*. Its teachings on the outer elixir reject the use of the five metals, eight stones, and various miscellaneous minerals as medicinal materials, instead taking the essence of heaven and earth and the radiance of sun and moon, blending them with the transformations of creation to form the divine elixir. This aligns with the words of the Yin Zhenren: \"From formlessness, form is generated—this is the returning elixir.\" The phrases \"ordinary lead and ordinary mercury require no manipulation\" are entirely consistent with what I have learned.\n\nThough this humble mountain-dwelling Daoist’s study of the Dao is shallow and offers little of value, I have long been versed in the discourse of Daoist texts. An ancient saying goes: \"Three broken arms make a good physician.\" I have known Wang Dao for a long time, and our discussions have been thorough. When he brought his composition to me for verification, it matched in its entirety what I received from my master. Thus, I dare not conceal it but, with trepidation, have transcribed and respectfully submitted it. I humbly hope that in Your Majesty’s moments of leisure, You might glance upon it.

      "translated_text": "**Annotated and Exegetical Commentary on the Ancient Text of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*, Volume One**\n*By Wang Dao of the Song Dynasty*\n\n**The Divine Chamber: The Pivotal Stanza of the Elixir (Chapter One)**\n\nThe Divine Chamber is the pivot of the elixir, the parent of all minerals, where cinnabar and mercury dwell apart.\n\n*Your servant Dao annotates:*\nThe Divine Chamber is the pivot of the elixir. It mirrors Heaven and Earth, gathering the essence and qi of the sun and moon to form the divine elixir of golden liquid—hence it is called the pivot of the elixir. The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* states: *\"Heaven and Earth are the gates of the Changes.\"* Such is the meaning. As the parent of all minerals: true lead arises prior to Heaven and Earth, serving as the father of the myriad things and the mother of the hundred spirits—hence it is called the parent of all minerals. The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* states: *\"They are the parents of all hexagrams.\"* Such is the meaning. As for cinnabar and mercury dwelling apart: cinnabar and mercury originally possess no form or substance; they are concealed within true lead. Only when they obtain the pure essence of the Great Yang can they manifest and transform within the Divine Chamber—hence they are said to dwell apart.\n\n*Your servant Dao exegetes:*\nAt the inception of the Great Ultimate, primordial qi transformed into Heaven and Earth, dividing into yin and yang to become the sun and moon. From these, humanity and all things were produced, forming the Three Powers. Among them, humans are the most numinous, thus the foremost of the myriad things. In high antiquity, humans dwelled in the world, their lifespans often spanning hundreds or thousands of years. Yet after the Yellow Emperor, lifespans gradually became uneven, with some long and others short. Why is this? It is because humans failed to embody the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth in their conduct, leading to premature harm. Heaven and Earth endure so long because they fully possess the greatness of pure primordial qi, enabling them to follow the four seasons, regulate the five phases, and move in accordance with nature.\n\nThe sages of antiquity, comprehending the Dao of Heaven and grasping its workings, harmonized with the primordial qi of nature to nourish their bodies, thereby attaining lifespans akin to Heaven and Earth. Later generations, however, were otherwise: the young, whose blood and qi had yet to mature, were led astray by lust; the old, whose blood and qi were waning, were beset by decline and illness. Even those who came to understand the Dao did so too late, though those who preserved themselves could still prolong their years. Thus, the perfected emulate Heaven and Earth’s transformations, establishing the furnace and tripod to concoct the divine medicine. The aged who ingest it gather essence and guard spirit, returning to youth; the young who ingest it attain immortality all the more swiftly. Therefore, Master Zhenyi states: *\"The cultivation of the divine elixir shares the same path as the creation of Heaven and Earth.\"* When expressed through the imagery of the *Changes*, none do not first gather the root of Heaven and Earth as the foundation of the Great Elixir. They take the movements of Heaven and Earth as the model for the Great Elixir, employing Kan and Li to enact water and fire, traversing Mao and You to govern punishment and virtue, stealing the numerical shifts of the four seasons, and returning them to the palm of the hand. They entrust the mechanisms of yin and yang’s movement and stillness to complete the winter and summer, the yin generation of *Chunhuo*, and the yang effusion of *Xuanxiao*. When in motion, Kun’s lower line transforms into the first nine; when at rest, Qian’s lower line reverts to the first six. These are all the great principles of elixir cultivation.\n\n**Exiting Yang and Entering Yin (Chapter Two)**\n\nExiting yang and entering yin, their radiance flows to the two directions; the numerical array is three, aligned with the symbols of water and fire.",

      "translated_text": "**Minister Dao’s Annotation States:**\n\n\"Exiting yang and entering yin, their radiance flows to the two directions\" means yang arises from *zi* and emerges above the earth, traversing *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, and *chen* until it reaches *si*, where yang reaches its apex—thus the Azure Dragon, essence of the sun, shines in the east. Yin descends from *wu* and enters the earth, passing through *wei*, *shen*, *you*, and *xu* until it reaches *hai*, where yin reaches its extreme—thus the White Tiger, splendor of the moon, gleams in the west.\n\n\"Numerical array is three, aligned with the symbols of water and fire\" means the two entities, Azure Dragon and White Tiger, are both formed by the steaming *qi* of the Vermilion Bird, hence the three agents.\n\nThe Great Elixir, from its inception to completion, relies solely on the two symbols of water and fire beyond the divine chamber of true lead—no other substances are intermixed.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Exegesis States:**\n\nIn refining the divine elixir of golden liquid, one must first recognize the root origin of the medicinal substances, then verify the advancing and retreating of the firing times. Yang ascends and yin descends, never departing from the *zi* and *wu* directions; the sun’s passage and moon’s return must reside in the *mao* and *you* positions. Employing *Kan* and *Li* to enact water and fire, the Dragon and Tiger transform into husband and wife, returning the sun’s essence to the moon’s cavern. Thus, within lead, cinnabar is produced; when the Vermilion Bird sports in the *Li* palace, mercury arises from cinnabar. Gold arises from *qing* (emotion), mercury from *xing* (nature). When *qing* and *xing* embrace, husband and wife unite, and the golden liquid forms naturally.\n\nThus, human *qing* and *xing* do not depart from the body, just as the elixir’s cinnabar and mercury both arise within lead. *Qing* and *xing* in humans are not external things, nor are cinnabar and mercury separate from lead. Know then that the sun’s ascent and moon’s descent, yin and yang’s alternation, all occur within Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the essence and marrow of *Qian* and *Kun* constantly gather within the *Qifang* of Cock’s Foot Mountain, becoming the ancestral root of the great medicine and the fundamental stem of the golden elixir.\n\nThe sun has three illuminations, the moon three shifts. When the sun emerges in the east and its radiance shines in the west, the true *qi* of the west’s White Tiger, Metal virtue, enters the *Qifang* and transforms into the six *wu*. When the sun sets in the west and its radiance shines in the east, the true *qi* of the east’s Azure Dragon, Wood virtue, enters the *Qifang* and transforms into the six *si*. When the sun and moon align at *wu* and their radiance shines in the north, the true *qi* of the south’s Vermilion Bird, Fire virtue, enters the *Qifang*, coalesces with earth, and takes form as black lead, ever abiding within the *Yaofang*—the root of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things.\n\nThus, Master Wei said: \"The sun conceals its virtue and sinks its brilliance; the moon bestows its virtue and spreads its light. The sun, receiving the moon’s transformation, does not suffer harm.\" Know then that the true primordial *qi* is the root of Heaven’s and Earth’s generation.\n\nThe ancient perfected ones, recognizing that divine substances concealed themselves therein, borrowed their symbolic forms to gather them as the parents of the medicine. They modeled the divine chamber after *Qian* and *Kun*, established the tripod’s legs to symbolize Cock’s Foot, and took the tally of fire as the standard for the four seasons. Returning metal and water to their natural state, they revolved the yang fire to restore the sun’s essence and turned the yin tally to summon the moon’s spirit. Thus, the true *qi* of the three directions converged within the golden crucible, and the supreme harmony of the four symbols congealed within the *Yaofang*. Intermingling in primordial chaos, they were refined within the *Yin’e* until the elixir was complete—all following the transformations of nature.\n\nNowadays, scholars claim that common mercury can become the golden elixir, and common black lead can serve as the river chariot, leading later generations into delusion, mistaking the false for the real. They devise countless methods, yet grow old without success. Mercury emerges from cinnabar through fire’s transformation, but in principle, it is merely mercury and can never become the golden liquid.\n\nLittle do they know that the golden liquid is endowed with Heaven and Earth’s natural *qi*, relying on the pure essence of yin and yang. Yin attaches to the moon as its ruler, its body concealed and nurturing within, corresponding to *wu* and *si* as the parents of the supreme medicine. How could common mercury or the five metals, eight stones, and minerals of mountains and marshes compare to the divine medicine’s mother?\n\nThe divine medicine is the treasure for transcending the world and extending life, the ancestor of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad spirits. Yet it is exceedingly difficult for people to recognize. Later learners, using various miscellaneous substances to concoct the golden liquid, fundamentally misunderstand the ancients’ intent. If miscellaneous substances could produce the golden elixir, it would be easily attained. What the ancients called \"lead\" and \"mercury\" were direct references to symbolic forms; later generations, failing to grasp their meaning, took cinnabar as lead and mercury as mercury—thus confusing the root with false substances, leading to a thousand failures and ten thousand defeats, never achieving success.\n\nThe true lead’s production, as discussed earlier, is entirely based on scriptural excerpts and aligns with the master’s teachings—this is not reckless speculation to mislead later learners. Those who love the Dao should take heed.\n\n**Regulation by the King (Chapter Three)**\n\nRegulation by the king employs martial force to suppress rebellion and civil governance to pacify.

      "translated_text": "**Minister Dao’s Annotation States:**\n\n\"Regulation by the king employs martial force to suppress rebellion and civil governance to pacify\" refers to the issuance of decrees—just as a king dispatches edicts to the four directions. Martial force is the fierce fire-phase; civil governance, the gentle fire-phase. This is likened to the firm preparation of the golden crucible and the secure sealing of the spirit-chamber. At the outset, a yielding and compliant fire is applied to draw in the yang harmonizing *qi*, causing it to reside within the crucible-chamber. Later, a fierce fire is employed, and the golden liquid, on the verge of bursting forth, is restrained by the Kun Palace, thus retaining its essence within to complete the transformation. This is akin to a kingdom beset by rebellious subjects, yet through the king’s skillful regulation, they reform their hearts and obey commands, unable to escape.\n\n\"Earth flourishes in the four seasons; its virtue reigns supreme\" refers to the true earth of *wu* and *ji*. True earth is true lead. True lead can summon the utmost harmonizing *qi* to the Central Palace, so that the *qi* of the Four Symbols—Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior—cannot coalesce into golden liquid without true earth. Earth resides in the Central Palace, hence it is called the Yellow Emperor. Harmonizing *qi* follows the four seasons to generate the myriad things, all of which possess it. The spirit-chamber is the master of harmonizing *qi*, flourishing in the four seasons, able to gather the essence of the sun and moon into the crucible, preventing its dispersion outward. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving through beginning and end.\"\n\n**Minister Dao’s Exegesis States:**\n\nThe king governs the realm: internally cultivating civil virtue, externally maintaining martial readiness, modeling after the Three Sovereigns to establish the hundred officials, and following the four seasons to sow the five grains. Thus, the kingdom attains peace and harmony, and harmonizing *qi* arises. The ancients applied the principles of governing the realm to the regulation of golden liquid and divine elixir. At the initial stage, the spirit-chamber must be established. Within the spirit-chamber lies the embryo; beyond the embryo, the golden crucible; and beyond the crucible, the furnace. When all is fully prepared, the essence of the golden liquid is generated, and the utmost harmonizing *qi* converges. The king embodies the Central Palace’s spirit-steed, able to subdue the flowing pearl and prevent its flight. The civil fire is the fire of generation; the martial fire, the fire of consolidation. Together, they enable the golden liquid to reach completion.\n\nIn ancient times, after Lord Gongsun ascended, he was matched with the virtue of the Central Earth. Harmonizing *qi* arises from the center, further enveloped by the four seasons, binding metal and water in harmony. The flowing pearl gradually coalesces into divine medicine. The maiden’s flowing pearl, a volatile substance without fixed abode, can only be regulated by earth, returning it to the natural course of transformation.\n\n**Kan-Li Numbers One and Two (Chapter Four)**\n\nKan-Li numbers one and two: south and north alone form the warp, hence they crown the seventy-two minerals.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Annotation States:**\n\n\"Kan-Li numbers one and two\": Heaven generates water in Kan, hence the number one governs it; Earth generates fire in Li, hence the number two governs it. \"South and north alone form the warp\": The north is the extreme of yin, where yang *qi* begins, passing through *zi*, *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, *chen*, and *si* to reach its end. The south is the extreme of yang, where yin *qi* begins, passing through *wu*, *wei*, *shen*, *you*, *xu*, and *hai* to reach its end. Both yin and yang *qi* originate and conclude at *zi* and *wu*, hence south and north alone form the warp. \"Hence they crown the seventy-two minerals\": True lead is born of precelestial *qi* and takes form in the postcelestial realm, thus it is the chief among all things and the root of the returning elixir.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Exegesis States:**\n\nAmong the arts of humanity, none are deemed more wondrous than the transmutation of metals into gold and silver, regarded as worldly treasures. Yet, of those who practice such arts, ten thousand fail for every one who succeeds. Even if success is achieved, it is not a treasure that transcends the world, nor an art that extends life or benefits the realm. Today’s Dao-seekers do not prioritize essence and life, instead blindly following one another, never attaining enlightenment. They remain unaware that the Great Elixir’s path lies entirely in the mutual necessity of yin and yang *qi* to form the supreme medicine. As the *True Person’s Cinnabar Formula* states: \"Refining the treasure unites with the utmost subtlety; refining subtlety unites with the utmost numinosity; refining numinosity unites with the utmost spirit; refining spirit unites with the Dao.\" Such profound words reveal the authenticity or falsity of the golden elixir and the depth or shallowness of its wondrous principles. Without encountering a perfected one’s secret instructions, how can one comprehend the true essence and become a transcendent being?\n\nThe *Kan* and *Li* trigrams represent *Li* fire and *Kan* water. The south and north positions are the roots of water and fire. Though divided into two forms, they originate from a single source. Once separated, each embodies its own nature, becoming one in essence and two in manifestation. The perfected one, recognizing this as the natural disposition of heaven, does not rely on artificial combination. Instead, the two symbols are united as one, refined into the supreme treasure. When ingested, it bestows longevity. These two celestial products, free from impurities, are the essence of the sun and moon, the marrow of heaven and earth. As the *Yijing* states: \"Heaven displays its images; the sage emulates them.\" This is returning to the root and reverting to the origin, moving from deliberate action to merge with effortless spontaneity.\n\nThus, water and fire, *Kan* and *Li*, ascending and descending between south and north, alone head the seventy-two minerals as the foundation of the elixir. By grasping the mechanism of heaven’s generation and destruction and the cycle of the sun and moon, the nature of being and non-being becomes self-evident.\n\n**Hard and Soft, Exterior and Interior (Chapter Five)**\n\nHard and soft possess exterior and interior; yin and yang are endowed by nature. Metal and fire serve their proper functions; metal and water mutually contain one another. Male and female unite as one body, their application ordered and systematic.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Annotation States:**\n\n\"Hard and soft possess exterior and interior; yin and yang are endowed by nature\": *Qian* yang is hard; *Kun* yin is soft. They envelop one another, uniting within the spirit-chamber, allowing the natural *qi* of yin and yang and the essence of the sun and moon to converge upon the golden embryo and coalesce into divine medicine. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"*Qian* hard and *Kun* soft unite and envelop one another.\"\n\n\"Metal and fire serve their proper functions; metal and water mutually contain one another\": Externally, water and fire are frequently applied; internally, metal and water constantly interact. Watery mercury generates the body of the Green Dragon; metallic essence nurtures the embryo of the White Tiger. As the sprouts gradually manifest, metal and water take form within the spirit-chamber. After prolonged interaction of metal and fire, spirit-water is born within the mother’s womb, and the elixir is completed. Mother and child yearn for one another, and metal and water naturally nourish.\n\n\"Male and female unite as one body, their application ordered and systematic\": Male and female are also the Dragon and Tiger, *Qian* and *Kun*, the sun and moon, yin and yang, *Kan* and *Li*, husband and wife, water and fire. When male and female intermingle, their essence transforms into beings. If their application follows principle, generation occurs naturally.",

      "translated_text": "The Minister of the Dao comments: The male pertains to the *Li* trigram, the image of the great yang and the sun; the female pertains to the *Kan* trigram, the image of the great yin and the moon. When sun and moon conjoin, metal and water naturally arise, and their natures harmonize in mutual affinity—no external substance is involved. If one forcibly combines them with杂物, the divine medicine will not possess its natural essence. Just as a young man reaching twenty and a maiden coming of age at fifteen yearn for each other, this too is a matter of natural spontaneity. The ancients used this analogy for the great elixir, which is no different from human procreation—both arise from natural essence. Cinnabar and mercury reside within lead’s body, emerging through the stimulation of water and fire, yet they are not external substances. The infant in the mother’s womb likewise arises from water and fire and is not an external substance. The ancients, understanding that these two kinds of essence and nature share the same fundamental root, thus guided the union of Dragon and Tiger’s essence to return and restore the qi of metal and water, naturally forming the supreme medicine. This is what is meant by \"the Dao of one yin and one yang.\" Without natural spontaneity, union cannot occur.\n\nFor example, when the two essences of male and female merge in bodily union, the sun’s departure and the moon’s arrival bring about natural transformation—how could external substances be required to conceive a child? This clarifies that the divine medicine must be formed from the *Li* fire and *Kan* water, not from杂物. From this, we know that the true essence of the sun and moon, refined into golden liquid, shares the same principle as human conception, differing only in whether one attains immortality or remains mortal, purity or impurity. The perfected ones, fearing that later learners might fail to grasp the true principle, thus use this analogy as proof. The remaining symbolic correspondences can be understood accordingly.\n\n**Chapter Six: Transformations Already Mysterious**\n\nTransformations already mysterious,\nIn the end, they return to renew the beginning.\nThe ninth day sets the measure;\nYang harmony aligns with dawn and dusk.\nThe cycle completes, matching Heaven’s heart.\nYang lines culminate at *si*;\nTrue yin emerges from *wu*,\nFrom *ding* to *hai* it concludes.\n\nThe Minister of the Dao annotates: \"Transformations already mysterious, in the end, they return to renew the beginning\" means that in refining the great elixir, completion should occur within one month. If the fire timing is imprecise or the crucible is not sealed, the spirit-essence descends minimally, and the golden liquid coagulates slowly, requiring another month. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When the *jiwei* day arrives at dusk, the end returns to renew the beginning.\"\n\n\"The ninth day sets the measure; yang harmony aligns with dawn and dusk\": At the night of the new moon, when the *zi* hour arrives and yang fire is about to rise, this is called the *Fuxi* hexagram, with the yang line emerging at the initial position of *Kun*. From *zi* to *si* is morning and day; from *wu* to *hai* is evening and night. Morning is governed by the *Zhun* hexagram, and evening by the *Meng* hexagram. The *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams govern the twelve hours of a day, forming the symbolic structure of the great elixir. One day is governed by two hexagrams, and one month by sixty hexagrams. Initially, it is *Zhun* and *Meng*; finally, it is *Jiwei*. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The celestial stems set the measure; movement and stillness have morning and evening.\"\n\n\"Matching Heaven’s heart, yang lines culminate at *si*\": Yang fire ascends from *zi* to *si*, where yang reaches its peak and yin arises at *wu*. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"In spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*.\"\n\n\"True yin emerges from *wu*, from *ding* to *hai* it concludes\": Yin符 descends from *wu* to *hai*, where yin reaches its peak and yang fire is reborn at *zi*. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"In autumn and winter, act externally, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*.\"\n\nThe Minister of the Dao comments: The Dao of the great elixir’s transformations begins with the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams. Yang fire arises at *zi*, and yin is born at *wu*. Yang reaches its peak at *si*, and yin culminates at *hai*. The twelve lines of *Qian* and *Kun* transform with the twelve hours to produce the golden liquid. Some who attempt the great elixir treat it as a trivial matter, recklessly proceeding, wasting wealth, emaciating their bodies, and exhausting their bones, yet never achieving success. How could they know that the supreme Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, inhales and exhales yin and yang, revolves the four seasons, steers the sun and moon, manifests the five phases, and cycles day and night to give birth to the myriad things—all governed by the transformations of the supreme Dao?\n\nThe perfected ones, understanding the root of the great Dao, can transcend the world. They emulate Heaven and Earth, gather yin and yang, collect the sun and moon’s ethereal souls, and merge the spirit-qi of water and fire to refine the supreme medicine, returning it to spontaneity. Though a thousand scriptures and ten thousand discourses have been left to guide future learners, those who study the Dao still fail to believe. They merely use tangible, material substances to imitate creation, never aligning with the supreme principle. Even if they achieve some success, they cannot restore youth, prolong life, or enable longevity. Instead, they may suffer boils, toxins, and hemorrhages. Those who refine the elixir—can they not be cautious?\n\n**Chapter Seven: Water and Fire Each in Their Place**\n\nWater and fire each in their place,\nHolding their boundaries to form cold and heat.\nEast and west mark benevolence and righteousness;\nThe five phases transform the four seasons.\nThus yin and yang interact,\nFollowing the Three-in-One to attain principle.\n\nThe Minister of the Dao annotates: \"Water and fire each in their place, holding their boundaries to form cold and heat\": Water is yin, reaching its coldest at *Kan*; fire is yang, reaching its hottest at *Li*. Each holds its place to form winter and summer. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; dawn and dusk follow cold and heat.\"\n\n\"East and west mark benevolence and righteousness; the five phases transform the four seasons\": The east pertains to wood, the source of all things’ growth, hence called benevolence and joy. The west pertains to metal, the agent of all things’ withering, hence called righteousness and anger. The qi of the five phases—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—transform to regulate the four seasons. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The hexagram lines contain benevolence and righteousness, manifesting joy and anger in due time.\"\n\n\"Thus yin and yang interact, following the Three-in-One to attain principle\": If the numbers of the four images do not lose their timing, the qi of yin and yang will follow water and fire, cold and heat, each attaining its principle.\n\nThe Minister of the Dao comments: The sun and moon move in their courses, and cold and heat follow their seasons. As the sun departs, the moon arrives; as the year shifts, the seasons turn. The qi of a year is compressed into a single day’s twelve hours, arranging spring, summer, autumn, and winter to correspond with the four seasons’ phases. Movement and symbolic correspondences must align with timing. If the sun and moon’s measures do not err and the cold and heat’s seasons are precise, the great elixir will surely be achieved.\n\nWhen the symbolic movements stir internally, one can foreknow the future: essence-qi is born within the chamber, and yin and yang conjoin within the crucible. Once yin and yang’s essence-qi are obtained, the crucible’s interior becomes moist and naturally flows, gradually generating transformations that correspond with the four seasons’ phases. Thus, Chapter Five states: \"Spring warms with benevolence; summer heats with propriety; autumn cools with righteousness; winter chills with wisdom.\" If the four seasons’ qi are harmonious, the year’s affairs will be accomplished.",

Mother and child yearn for one another, and metal and water naturally nourish.\n\n\"Male and female unite as one body, their application ordered and systematic\": Male and female are also the Dragon and Tiger, *Qian* and *Kun*, the sun and moon, yin and yang, *Kan* and *Li*, husband and wife, water and fire. When male and female intermingle, their essence transforms into beings. If their application follows principle, generation occurs naturally.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, the spring qi is the root of all living things, corresponding to the yang fire phase before noon; the autumn qi is the root of all withering things, corresponding to the yin tally phase after noon. Within the twelve double-hours, *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* belong to spring; *mao*, *chen*, and *si* to summer; *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* to autumn; *you*, *xu*, and *hai* to winter. When the fire phases are circulated through the twelve double-hours in accord with the four seasons and the Five Agents, not deviating by even a hair’s breadth, the crucible’s interior will gradually congeal into liquid gold, and the elixir will surely form.\n\nThus the song states:\n*The sage seizes the intent of Creation’s work,*\n*Rolling sun and moon in hand, placing them within the furnace.*\n*Gently stirring, inverting heaven and earth’s essence,*\n*Gathering yin and yang, the gods and spirits flee—*\n*Then one knows the liquid gold and divine elixir.*\nWere it not for the Dao’s symbolic correspondences aligning with heaven and earth, and the natural transformations of yin and yang, there would be no accomplishment.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Establishing the Chamber’s Position**\n\nEstablishing the chamber’s position—transformation lies within it. The *shen-shi* (spirit-chamber) is the upper and lower crucibles. *Establishing the position* means arranging the intimate union of the feminine and masculine. *Transformation* refers to cinnabar and mercury—these are the two functions of metal and earth. The two functions have no fixed hexagram positions; they spread their wings, soaring through *xu* and *wei*. Their coming and going are not constant, their above and below have no permanence. Dwelling alone, they do not alter, but return to the Central Palace—without earth, they cannot be controlled.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* annotates: *\"Establishing the chamber’s position—transformation lies within it\"* means erecting the spirit-chamber to model heaven and earth. Once heaven and earth are positioned, the radiance of sun and moon shines within them. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Heaven and earth establish their positions, the Changes move within them\"*—this is the meaning. The *shen-shi* is the upper and lower crucibles, corresponding to heaven and earth. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Heaven and earth are Qian and Kun\"*—this is the meaning. *Establishing the position* means arranging the intimate union of the feminine and masculine. Setting up the positions of heaven and earth, Qian and Kun: the upper crucible models heaven, the masculine, and Qian; the lower crucible models earth, the feminine, and Kun. Thus, the upper and lower crucibles, in the union of feminine and masculine, become one. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Establishing the position means arranging the union of yin and yang\"*—this is the meaning.\n\n*Transformation* refers to cinnabar and mercury—these are the two functions of metal and earth. When the crucible is established according to the method of Qian and Kun, the Metal Mother resides in the center, and the Three Powers are complete, giving birth to living mercury. Cinnabar and mercury are the water and fire of Kan and Li, the two functions of Qian and Kun. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"The Changes call Kan and Li the two functions of Qian and Kun\"*—this is the meaning. The *two functions without fixed hexagram positions, spreading their wings, soaring through xu and wei* refer to Qian and Kun, the sun and moon. The sun and moon’s ascent and descent, the extraction and addition of water and fire, are not bound to hexagram positions. *Zhang* and *yi* are the position of Li fire in the south; *xu* and *wei* are the position of Kan water in the north. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"The two functions have no fixed positions, circulating through the six voids\"*—this is the meaning. *Their coming and going are not constant, their above and below have no permanence* means that water and fire come and go within the spirit-chamber, not fixed in one place. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Their coming and going are not constant, their above and below have no permanence\"*—this is the meaning. *Dwelling alone, they do not alter, but return to the Central Palace* means that if the fire’s extraction and addition follow principle, they will constantly transform and enter the Central Palace as liquid gold. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Hidden and submerged, they transform within the center\"*—this is the meaning. *Without earth, they cannot be controlled; earth envelops all stones as the ancestor of the elixir* means that the Central Palace’s spirit-chamber, refined with true lead, is called the virtue of earth. It envelops the ten thousand things as the ancestor of liquid gold. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Enveloping the ten thousand things, it is the guiding principle of the Dao\"*—this is the meaning.\n\nMinister Dao annotates: The Great Elixir’s Dao relies entirely on lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury—these two substances. Cinnabar and mercury are the essence of the sun; lead and silver are the splendor of the moon. The method of refining liquid gold does not depart from the profound images of heaven and earth. The previous discussion has already made this quite clear, yet I still fear that students may not comprehend it, so I repeatedly employ analogies. If one understands the words immediately, then cinnabar and mercury can be obtained without labor. Moreover, the presence of cinnabar and mercury in lead is like the presence of human nature and emotions: nature and emotions arise within and respond without, not coming from outside. Cinnabar and mercury are born within and manifest without, also not coming from outside. The two functions of nature and emotions reside within the body; the two names of cinnabar and mercury both dwell within lead. When humans employ nature and emotions, they manifest externally; when lead contains cinnabar and mercury, they operate internally. Thus, one must distinguish their mechanisms. The *Cantong Qi*’s perfected person clearly points out: employ the essence of the sun and moon, combine them to form the medicine—do not use miscellaneous things or other methods.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Mutual Restraint of Being and Non-Being**\n\nMutual restraint of being and non-being: the Vermilion Bird flames in the void, the purple radiance shines like the sun—cinnabar and mercury perish.\n\nMinister Dao annotates: *Mutual restraint of being and non-being*—*being* is the tiger, *non-being* is the dragon; *being* is white metal, *non-being* is the qi of yin and yang. Using white metal as the spirit-chamber, it cannot generate transformation on its own; only through the ascent and descent of water and fire, circulating the four seasons, can the elixir be formed. Thus, an empty vessel is used to restrain being. The Vermilion Bird is the spirit-fire, steaming from below within the spirit-chamber, from which liquid gold is born through fire. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"To restrain being with non-being, the vessel must be empty\"*—this is the meaning. *The purple radiance shines like the sun—cinnabar and mercury perish* means that the purple radiance, the essence of the sun and moon, resides within the divine crucible. Sometimes it transforms into golden radiance, manifesting the light of the sun and moon; sometimes it changes into numinous liquid, revealing the forms of dragon and tiger. Shining within the crucible, it becomes cinnabar and mercury—now vanishing, now appearing; now floating, now sinking—following water and fire, sometimes perishing, sometimes disappearing. The *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Thus, one observes their ebb and flow—Kan and Li vanish and perish\"*—this is the meaning.\n\nMinister Dao elucidates: The ancients of high antiquity refined mercury alone into the elixir, for they had the dragon but not the tiger. Without relying on the Five Agents or Four Images, modeling heaven and earth, or guarding the union of husband and wife, yin and yang, male and female, they simply took the waxing and waning of yin and yang, Kan and Li’s qi within the body, and the essence of dragon and tiger nurtured within the seven orifices, trusting in spontaneity to unite with the Great Dao. Thus, the ancients all lived long lives without premature death. Since middle antiquity, if one wished to reverse aging, return to youth, prolong life, transcend the world, ascend to the real, and enter the wondrous, one had to install the furnace, establish the crucible, summon the harmonious qi of heaven and earth, and return the splendor of the sun and moon’s essence. Only when the Four Images are secure, the Five Agents complete, the nine revolutions finished, and the three thousand hours fulfilled—then, upon opening the furnace, purple powder congeals like frost, golden radiance shines like the sun. Ingesting it, one attains longevity after heaven and old age. Yet among people today, many know the tiger, but few recognize the dragon. The liquid gold is the Azure Dragon, the ancestor of the east’s Wood virtue—it is the sun.",

      "translated_text": "The Yellow Sprout is the White Tiger, the ancestor of the west’s Metal liquid—it is the moon. The essence and qi of these two substances both possess principles of divine transformation and change. Thus, the scripture states: \"The essence of the sun and moon rescues the old and infirm.\" When refined with proper method and ingested, they too can effect transformation.\n\nAs for the transformations of the elixir: cinnabar transforms into mercury, which is yang returning to yin; mercury in turn transforms back into cinnabar, which is yin returning to yang. Though called the \"Pure Yang Elixir,\" when ingested by humans, it assuredly grants longevity. The sages compared the sun and moon’s hun and po to nothing but the positions of Kan and Li, with no other substances involved. Fearing that later generations might fail to grasp the true principle, they spoke plainly to instruct posterity.\n\n**Secret Formula, Chapter Ten: \"The Secret Formula Is Not Arbitrarily Composed\"**\nThe secret formula is not arbitrarily composed; its principles are not baseless fabrications. Condensing the profound to extend the subtle, one seeks the numinous and unfolds the trigrams and Five Agents into a classic. Kan is the male essence of Metal; Li is the female radiance of Fire. Metal and Wood contend; Water and Fire overcome each other. Earth flourishes in the Metal domain, and the three substances all perish. The Four Seas converge, bringing about great peace—all through the power of Earth’s virtue in the Central Palace, the achievement of the Yellow Emperor.\n\nYour servant Dao annotates: \"The secret formula is not arbitrarily composed; its principles are not baseless fabrications.\" The sages bequeathed writings to the world without careless composition or reckless speech to mislead later generations. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Words are not carelessly composed; theories are not idly generated.\"\n\n\"Condensing the profound to extend the subtle, one seeks the numinous\": cutting away the superfluous, one grasps the pivotal essentials, verifying the wondrous principles of the sun and moon and aligning with the supreme essence of the numinous. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Drawing verification to witness efficacy, one measures the numinous.\"\n\n\"Unfolding the trigrams and Five Agents into a classic\": embodying the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi* to determine the fire times, relying on the Five Agents—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—to govern generation and destruction, using the conjunction of the sun and moon to verify the union of husband and wife, and the intercourse of Kan and Li to produce the supreme essence. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Pursuing the origins of written characters to verify the principles.\"\n\n\"Kan is the male essence of Metal; Li is the female radiance of Fire\": Kan conceals the six *wu* (戊), the essence of the moon, the position of male yang residing in the north—the moon is yin. *Wu* is yang, the yang within yin, resembling Metal born within Water—the Tiger. Li conceals the six *ji* (己), the radiance of the sun, the position of female yin residing in the south—the sun is yang. *Ji* is yin, the yin within yang, resembling Mercury born within Fire—the Dragon. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Kan’s *wu* is the moon’s essence; Li’s *ji* is the sun’s radiance.\"\n\n\"Metal and Wood contend; Water and Fire overcome each other\": Metal is white Metal; Wood is red Mercury. When these two contend, they become ever more flourishing. When Water and Fire alternately overcome each other, great brilliance is manifest. As the sun and moon conjoin, hardness and softness mutually arise, and yin and yang attain their principles, then they harmoniously unite. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The sun and moon are the *Yi*; hardness and softness correspond.\"\n\n\"Earth flourishes in the Metal domain, and the three substances all perish\": the three substances—Metal, Wood, and Fire—are enveloped by the tail Fire of the four seasons. After nine revolutions, they are all transformed into the dust of the bright window. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving from beginning to end.\"\n\n\"The Four Seas converge, bringing about great peace\": inhaling and exhaling the qi of the four directions, they converge within the divine crucible. Drawing the essence of the Dragon and Tiger to become the supreme medicine, completing the work with the Five Earths and wrapping it with the four seasons, one obtains the red, green, black, and white, each performing its function to perfect the divine elixir. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Green, red, white, and black each reside in their respective directions.\"\n\n\"All through the power of Earth’s virtue in the Central Palace, the achievement of the Yellow Emperor\": the Earth virtue of the Central Palace is the supremely harmonious qi of *wu* and *ji*. The Way of the Metal liquid’s transformations all derives from *wu* and *ji*. *Wu* and *ji* reside in the Central Palace, hence called the Yellow Emperor. Those who refine the divine elixir gather the supreme essence of the sun and moon, unite the numinous qi of yin and yang, and when the cycles of the stars are complete and the movements of Water and Fire conclude, all return to the achievement of Earth’s virtue, the Yellow Emperor. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"All derive from the power of *wu* and *ji* in the Central Palace.\"\n\nYour servant Dao comments: The people of high antiquity did not speak idly; secrets were not transmitted twice. After success, they inscribed it on tablets to guide later generations of those who love the Dao. Moreover, what is conveyed in texts only outlines the general meaning. Now, pointing directly to the source of the great medicine, it enables later generations to dispense with worldly cinnabar and mercury. If one obtains the wondrous method and follows the movements of heaven and earth, yin and yang, and the four seasons to achieve the elixir, this is true yin and true yang. As the *Yinfu Jing* states: \"Heaven’s mechanism unfolds, and one does not die.\" Those who attain this Dao must not recklessly transmit it to others. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Inscribing feelings on bamboo and silk, one fears leaking the celestial tally, hesitating and sighing, constantly pondering.\"\n\nRefining the supreme medicine does not exceed Water and Fire. When Water and Fire have intercourse, the qi of the Dragon and Tiger within the crucible harmoniously unite to form the Metal liquid. Thus, true Lead is the father and mother of the golden elixir, the ancestor of numinous Mercury. All transformations and the nurturing of all beings derive from this to come into being. Once true Lead is obtained, the body is stabilized, and the true method of Water and Fire is known—how could the great elixir fail to be achieved?\n\n**Gold and Fire are Lead, Chapter Eleven**\nGold and Fire are Lead. When cinnabar is manifest, nothing is greater than Gold and Fire. Speaking of the profound to perfect transformation: when yang moves, yin dissipates; the primordial chaos ultimately unites. The nine treasures’ essences mutually sustain each other. Hexagrams and medicine unite. Gold has three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*; each *zhu* corresponds to one *jin*, which is sixteen *liang*. When the essence of Gold transforms, the two qi become the elixir. The Azure Dragon receives the tally at this time. Within the divine chamber, its essence is refined. Gold and Fire interact, propelling the male yang’s emerald-green Water and the female yin’s ochre-yellow Gold. Yin and yang intermingle, uniting their essences and enveloping the primordial qi. The ten thousand images rely on emptiness to arise; through resonance and transformation, each has its being. The numinous traces of the many elixirs—none do not derive from this for attaining longevity.\n\nYour servant Dao annotates: \"Gold and Fire are true Lead.\" The two characters \"Gold\" and \"Fire\" are the essence of the sun and moon. Gold is the root of the moon; Fire is the root of the sun—both are born within Lead. Master Wei took Gold and Fire as the *Yi* and the *Yi* as the medicine. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The *Yi* is the image.\" \"When cinnabar is manifest, nothing is greater than [Gold and Fire]\": cinnabar is the Metal liquid. The great elixir of the Metal liquid relies solely on the essence of the sun and moon to be achieved. \"Gold is Lead; the moon is Water.\"",

The liquid gold is the Azure Dragon, the ancestor of the east’s Wood virtue—it is the sun.",

      "translated_text": "Mercury is cinnabar; Fire is the sun. Externally, Water and Fire ascend and descend; internally, Lead and Mercury intertwine and conjoin—beyond these, no other elixirs may enter. The transformations of Gold and cinnabar arise wholly from the essence of the sun and moon. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When suspended images manifest their brightness, none are greater than the sun and moon.\" To speak of exhausting the subtle and mastering transformation: when Yang moves, Yin recedes. The ancients exhausted its subtleties and observed its waxing and waning, causing the qi of Yin and Yang to flow and rest in ceaseless circulation, completing the cycle of day and night. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Exhausting the numinous to know transformation: when Yang departs, Yin arrives.\"\n\nAt the culmination of primordial chaos, the nine treasures of essence mutually sustain one another. The qi of Kan and Li, Dragon and Tiger, intermingle within the numinous chamber, advancing and retreating with Water and Fire. At the outset, in the first palace of the Kan position, when the Fire number first stirs, essence and qi intermingle—this is before any transformation occurs. By the time of the Si position, when the Fire number reaches its apex, the Dragon generates Mercury and the Tiger generates Lead. The essence of Lead and Mercury gradually sprouts, while within the crucible, the qi of the sun and moon revolve externally, and the essence of Water and Fire unfolds and contracts internally. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Like spokes converging at the hub, they revolve, emerging and entering, ever unfolding and contracting.\"\n\nThe hexagrams and the medicine unite: Gold comprises three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*. Each *zhu* corresponds to one *liang*, and sixteen *liang* make one *jin*. The hexagrams contain three hundred and eighty-four lines, matching the number of days in a celestial cycle, which together govern the entire fire-phase. Gold consists of three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, and the Gold Mother totals one *jin*, which together govern the entire *jin* of the great elixir. The fire-phase and the Gold Mother thus perfectly correspond. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The *Yi* has three hundred and eighty-four lines; according to the lines, the tally is drawn.\"\n\nWhen the essence of Gold transforms, the Two Qi form the elixir. The Azure Dragon receives the tally: the Great Yin is the liquid of Metal-Tiger; the Great Yang is the fluid of Wood-Dragon. These transform into the true elixir. At the inception of the dark and new moon, when the Azure Dragon’s Fire Spirit assumes authority, the hexagram Zhen presides. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new, Zhen arrives to receive the tally.\"\n\nAt this very moment, within the numinous chamber, its essence is refined as Gold and Fire interact and propel one another—precisely when the Azure Dragon receives the tally and the fire is applied. Within the numinous chamber, the qi of Dragon and Tiger intertwine, the essence of Gold and Fire coalesce, and the numinous elixir is transformed. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"At this moment, Heaven and Earth conjoin their essence; the sun and moon mutually sustain one another.\"\n\nThe Azure Green Water of potent Yang and the Cinnabar Gold of latent Yin: potent Yang is Qian, Heaven.",

      "translated_text": "Lead and Fire are indeed Water and Fire. When Gold and Fire interact, cinnabar is born within true Lead. What the ancients guarded most closely was the Fire Regimen alone. The Fire tally is one *jin*; the Mother tally is likewise one *jin*. When the Mother tally of one *jin* is divided, it becomes 384 *zhu*; when the Fire tally of one *jin* is divided, it becomes 384 *yao*, corresponding to the sixty-four hexagrams of a year. Thus, the tally of *Qian* is 216, and the tally of *Kun* is 144. Extending and expanding these, they reach 1,520, matching the tally of the myriad things and completing one cycle of Heaven and Earth. The ancients modeled their methods upon Heaven and Earth, aligning with the rise and fall of Yin and Yang, the ascent and descent of Water and Fire, the nature of Gold and Wood, and the embodiment of hardness and softness—thereby perfecting the transformations of the Great Dao. The tallies of *Qian* and *Kun*, each *yao* unfolding the Fire Regimen, reveal the subtleties of the Great Elixir’s numbers, manifesting the essence of Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—these are the celestial signs. The refined supreme medicine and the movement of the Fire Regimen all accord with the numbers of these celestial signs. If one condenses the numbers of years, months, days, and hours into the twelve hours of a single day, advancing the Yang Fire and retreating the Yin tally to refine the Golden Fluid Divine Elixir, then the principle of creation can be immediately attained.\n\nThereupon, in *Chapter Twelve: The Mysterious Moisture and Radiant Luster*, the Primordial Sovereign of Mysterious Moisture and Radiant Luster begins to refine Mercury within the numinous chamber, which embraces the hollow and profound, where the Mysterious White gives birth to Lord Gold. Towering and majestic, he establishes the primordial beginning, as the Three and Five guard one another, their flying essence nourishing and moistening.\n\nThe *Chendao Annotation* states: \"Here, the Primordial Sovereign of Mysterious Moisture and Radiant Luster begins to refine Mercury within the numinous chamber, which embraces the hollow and profound—this is when black Lead is transmuted into the essence of white Gold, its luster penetrating through to form the body of the numinous chamber, hollow within and an inch in diameter, to generate true Mercury. The Primordial Sovereign is the master who refines the Golden Elixir. As the *Baopuzi* states: 'The Primordial Sovereign herself said, “I too refined the Elixir and attained immortality.”' Fu Xi drew the Eight Trigrams, and Confucius expounded the *Yijing* images—both clarified these numbers of Heaven and Earth. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Thus, Confucius praised the Primal Chaos, where the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* embraces the hollow and profound.' The Mysterious White gives birth to Lord Gold, towering and majestic, establishing the primordial beginning—this is the Mysterious generating white Gold. Thus, it can gather and nurture the essence of the sun and moon. Before the Yang Fire moves, both are concealed within white Gold, their forms unseen. Once Water and Fire circulate, the Gold Flower emerges from within white Gold—the Gold Flower is the harmonious *qi* of *wu* and *si*. When these two substances meet and interact, they generate the Elixir, which may truly be called towering and exalted. Investigating the ancient origins, this substance has always existed, enveloping Yin and Yang, never departing from the forms of the myriad things. The meaning of the *Guanju* lies in this: when Water and Fire interact, cinnabar and Mercury are born, and spirit and illumination emerge. Thus, it is the mother of the myriad things and the beginning of Yin and Yang. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Examining antiquity, when the Primordial Sovereign reigned, the *Guanju* established the primordial beginning.' The Three and Five guard one another, their flying essence moistening and nourishing the Fluid.\"",

      "translated_text": "When Water, Fire, and Earth interact, the divine essence descends into the crucible. Thus, the ancient sages established the divine chamber—the *Jiji* crucible—where the forms of male and female unite, and the shapes of Dragon and Tiger merge. At first, form and substance remain undifferentiated, like primordial chaos. After the firing process, the essences of husband and wife intertwine, the passions of Dragon and Tiger harmonize, and the *yuan-nian* begins, bowing at its inception to ultimately refine the divine medicine.\n\nAs the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When the marriage *qi* intertwines, the *yuan-nian* sprouts and flourishes.\" The *Chendao Shu* says: \"The Primordial Sovereign, who refined the Elixir and attained immortality, was the ancestral master of antiquity. He modeled the numbers of Heaven and Earth, approximated the movements of the Sun and Moon, and with the crucible—symbolizing Qian and Kun—left a hollow space of slightly over an inch to house the numinous Mercury. This method mirrors the dynamic: when movement arises, Heaven’s *qi* descends, Earth’s *qi* responds, and the supreme essences of Heaven and Earth interact to generate the divine fluid.\" Truly towering and exalted, this is the most wondrous mystery.\n\nAncient immortals who attained the Dao feared that later generations would fail to grasp the true principle. Thus, they used cinnabar, Mercury, and various other medicinal substances to concoct the Great Elixir, unaware of the transformations of true Lead. Therefore, they employed symbolic language to enlighten disciples. If one resorts to miscellaneous methods, it is like entering the mountains to catch fish or a dragon seeking pheasants and hares in water—both are futile endeavors, a waste of effort.\n\n---\n\n*The Mysterious Woman Expounds Her Preface*, Chapter Thirteen:\n*The Mysterious Woman Expounds Her Preface: Wu and Si Prize the Celestial Tally*\n\nThe Celestial Tally’s Dao gradually wanes, making it difficult to align with the Mysterious Diagram. The *Chendao* annotation states: \"*The Mysterious Woman Expounds Her Preface: Wu and Si Prize the Celestial Tally*—the Mysterious Woman embodies the spirit of Heaven and Earth, the numinous *qi* of Yin and Yang. Her spirit permeates all, her form pervades everything. She knows the nature of the myriad things and comprehends the patterns of all transformations, serving as the sovereign of the Daoist teachings. *Wu* and *Si* are the harmonious *qi*, the root of the Great Elixir. When the Celestial Tally moves, it generates the essence of *Wu* and *Si*.\"\n\nAs the *Cantong Qi* says: \"The sage does not arise in vain; above, he observes the manifest Celestial Tally.\" \"*The Celestial Tally’s Dao gradually wanes, making it difficult to align with the Mysterious Diagram*—the Celestial Tally advances in *zi*, the Yang Fire increasing daily until *si*, where Yang reaches its peak. The Celestial Tally retreats in *wu*, the Yin tally decreasing daily until *hai*, where Yin reaches its extreme. The Five Phases exhaust their mutual conquest, and the four seasons complete their cycle, hence the Dao gradually wanes.\"\n\nAs the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The Celestial Tally has advance and retreat, contraction and extension, to correspond with the seasons. Thus, the *Yi* governs the heart of Heaven.\" The *Chendao Shu* says: \"The Mysterious Woman is also an ancient immortal, the leader of all immortals. *Wu* and *Si* are Earth; the Celestial Tally is Fire. Fire is the primordial *qi*. Vast, it encompasses Heaven and Earth; minute, it hides within a single hair. The ten thousand numinous transformations all partake of its primordial *qi*. Its vastness envelops and embraces, its subtlety permeates and spreads, giving birth, nurturing, restraining, and overcoming. The cycles of Metal and Water revolve, Yin and Yang flourish and wither, and the myriad things transform without end. It possesses the most wondrous and supreme efficacy. The Perfected One borrows this numinous transformation to cultivate the supreme medicine, gathering the supreme essences of the Sun and Moon, harmonizing warmth, coolness, cold, and heat, extracting and adding Water and Fire, following the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and aligning with the four seasons’ flourishing, waning, prosperity, and decline—all in accord with nature. If one uses gold, silver, herbs, or frost to concoct the Golden Fluid and divine Elixir, how could such transformations ever arise?\"\n\n*Ancient Text: Dragon and Tiger Classic, Annotated and Explained, Volume One*\n*From the Imperial Four Treasuries*",

Cinnabar flows as mercury; Father is *wu* and *ji*, Mother is yellow gold. The bell and pitch-pipe return the two sixes; the Dipper’s handle establishes the three nines. The Crimson Youth plays with the Vermilion Bird, transforming into the Azure Dragon.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Annotation:**\n\"Thus, the intent of concocting the Elixir—Heaven and Earth no longer speak of it\" refers to the previous chapter, which expounded the intent of the Great Elixir, establishing the divine chamber and exhausting its wondrous principles. Thus, this chapter no longer repeats it.\n\n\"Cinnabar flows as mercury; Father is *wu* and *ji*, Mother is yellow gold\": Cinnabar is the Sun; flowing mercury is the Sun’s spirit. *Wu* and *ji* are the Moon; yellow gold is the Moon’s essence. Cinnabar and *wu-ji* generate these two flavors—spirit and essence—to become the supreme medicine, hence they are called Father and Mother.\n\n\"The bell and pitch-pipe return the two sixes; the Dipper’s handle establishes the three nines\": The two sixes refer to *zi, yin, chen, wu, shen, xu* as the six *lü* (pitch-pipes), and *chou, mao, si, wei, you, hai* as the six *lü* (harmonics). Moreover, *zi* is the Yellow Bell, and *wu* is the Jade Flute, which govern the twelve hours. The three nines also make twelve. The Dipper’s pointer determines the establishment: the first month establishes *yin*, the second month establishes *mao*, and so on through the twelve branches. As the *Canon of Pivoting Harmony* states: \"Waxing and waning respond to the pitch-pipes; rising and falling rely on the Dipper’s pivot.\"\n\n\"The Crimson Youth plays with the Vermilion Bird, transforming into the Azure Dragon\": The Crimson Youth is the Sun; the Vermilion Bird is Fire. Once Fire moves, the Sun generates mercury within the divine chamber, hence it is named the Azure Dragon. An ancient poem says: \"The Five Agents’ inverted art—dragons emerge from Fire.\"\n\n**Minister Dao’s Exegesis:**\nThe Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams determine fortune and misfortune. Thus, *Qian* is Heaven—still, it is concentrated; in motion, it is straight. *Kun* is Earth—still, it contracts; in motion, it expands. Therefore, the classic states: \"*Qian* and *Kun* are the body of Heaven and Earth; *Kan* and *Li* are the function of Heaven and Earth.\" The Dao gives birth to Heaven; Heaven gives birth to Earth; Earth gives birth to the myriad things. Thus, the movement and stillness of *Qian* and *Kun* give rise to the myriad things—this is Heaven.",

      "translated_text": "The former is emptiness—yang, hardness, the sun, the father, Heaven. The latter is fullness—yin, softness, the moon, the mother, Earth. All below emptiness is Earth; all above fullness is Heaven. Thus, the interplay of emptiness and fullness gives rise to the six lines’ transformations. Therefore, *Qian* employs seven and nine, while *Kun* employs six and eight. The numbers of the Four Images correspond to the numbers of *Qian* and *Kun*, revealing the distinctions between old and young yin and yang. Four interacting with six yields twenty-four, thus forming the boundary of one old yin line; four interacting with eight yields thirty-two, forming the boundary of one young yin line; four interacting with seven yields twenty-eight, forming the boundary of one young yang line; four interacting with nine yields thirty-six, forming the boundary of one old yang line. These four boundaries constitute the completion numbers of *Qian* and *Kun*. The transformations of six and nine give rise to the generative numbers of the six lines.\n\nUsing old yin and old yang—nine and six—*Qian* and *Kun* alternate in transformation, while young yang and young yin—seven and eight—do not partake. *Qian* has six lines, and Earth receives three; *Kun* has six lines, and Heaven receives three. The two trigrams *Qian* and *Kun* form the transformative body of Heaven and Earth, perpetually merging as one and unfolding within the six voids, ascending and descending with the two qi of yin and yang, shifting and changing amid the six lines.\n\nWhen *Qian* moves, it is straight and unyielding—yang fire blazes forth from below Earth, transforming *Kun*’s lower line into *Fu*. This is called \"Initial Nine,\" the master of the six yang lines, where subtle yang has just arisen. The second transformation becomes *Lin*, where yang qi begins to flow; the third transformation brings yin and yang into communion, forming *Tai*, as the myriad things sprout, breaking through the earth. The fourth transformation becomes *Dazhuang*, where the myriad things flourish; the fifth transformation becomes *Guai*, where all plants reveal their essence. By the time of the \"Upper Nine,\" it transforms into pure *Qian*—yang light radiates brilliantly, suffusing the southwest with lush vegetation. The yang light ascends above, the five colors gleam upon the head, and wells and springs freeze—this is the time of *Qian*’s full cycle.\n\nWhen *Kun* moves, it expands without obstruction—yin stillness, solemn and serene, emerges from above Heaven, transforming *Qian*’s lower line into *Gou*. This is called \"Initial Six,\" the master of the six yin lines, where subtle yin has just arisen. The second transformation becomes *Dun*, where yin qi begins to flow; the third transformation severs the communion of yin and yang, forming *Pi*, as the myriad things ripen, their fruits hanging low. The fourth transformation becomes *Guan*, where the myriad things wither; the fifth transformation becomes *Bo*, where all plants return to concealment. By the time of the \"Upper Six,\" it transforms into pure *Kun*—yin essence, chilling and pervasive, blankets the southwest with withered, yellowed vegetation. Yin essence sinks below, the five colors hide within the roots, and wells and springs grow warm—this is the time of *Kun*’s full cycle.\n\nThus, the classic states: \"The sun enters the earth, forming the image of congealed essence; after a second transformation, it becomes *Fu*, giving birth to the myriad things.\" From this, we know that the two bodies of *Qian* and *Kun* shift and move with the qi of yin and yang, ascending and descending within the six voids. One darkness, one brightness—cycling endlessly through day and night, the sun departs and the moon arrives, like a ring without end, beyond all reckoning. Only the singular, primal, harmonious qi brings about these transformations.\n\nThe ancient perfected ones understood the waxing and waning of Heaven and Earth, the expansion and contraction of yin and yang. Thus, they entrusted the *Yi*’s images to model *Qian* and *Kun*, aligning yin and yang with water and fire. They summoned the supreme harmony of Heaven and Earth, drew forth the pure essence of the sun and moon, and gathered them within the divine chamber. There, they transformed the liquid gold, transmuting the mortal frame into a sacred body. With merits complete and virtues fulfilled, their titles became \"Perfected Ones.\" Who would not call them divine?\n\n**Minister Dao’s Annotation on *Kun*’s Initial Transformation into *Zhen* (Chapter Fifteen):**\nWhen *Kun*’s first transformation yields *Zhen*, on the third day, the moon emerges at *geng*, dividing east and west between *mao* and *you*. Dragon and tiger seek each other.\n\nWhen *Kun*’s second transformation yields *Dui*, on the eighth day, the moon emerges at *ding*, its upper half like a balance. Half a catty of gold.\n\nWhen *Kun*’s third transformation yields *Qian*, on the fifteenth day, the three yang lines are complete, illuminating the east at *jia*. Metal and water grow warm; the sun’s red marrow flows as mercury. The maiden plays with golden earrings; the moon waxes and naturally conjoins.\n\n**Minister Dao’s Commentary:**\nWhen *Kun*’s first transformation yields *Zhen*, on the third day, the moon emerges at *geng*: at midnight before the new moon, at the *zi* hour, the initial movement of yang fire begins. The sun and moon conjoin at the *Bi* and *Mao* constellations, where *Qian* intersects *Kun*’s lower line to form the *Zhen* trigram. *Zhen* governs affairs—one yang line arises below, so by the third day, the moon appears at the *geng* direction. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"On the third day, it emerges as brightness; *Zhen* receives *geng* in the west.\"\n\n\"Dividing east and west between *mao* and *you*, dragon and tiger seek each other\": The east and west gates of the two eights are the directions of the sun and moon’s rising and setting. Once metal and water are properly positioned and the fire time has advanced five days, the qi of dragon and tiger yearn for each other, gathering within the crucible.\n\nWhen *Kun*’s second transformation yields *Dui*, on the eighth day, the moon emerges at *ding*, its upper half like a balance: From the sixth to the eighth day, the upper half is complete. *Qian* intersects *Kun*’s second line to form the *Dui* trigram, which governs affairs—two yang lines arise in the middle, so the moon’s light achieves half-illumination, level as a cord, appearing at the *ding* direction. This illustrates the crucible where metal and fire are evenly matched. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*; the upper half is level as a cord.\"\n\nWhen *Kun*’s third transformation yields *Qian*, on the fifteenth day, the three yang lines are complete, illuminating the east at *jia*: From the eleventh to the fifteenth day, *Qian* intersects *Kun*’s upper line to form the *Qian* trigram, which governs affairs—three yang lines arise above, so the moon’s light becomes full, appearing at the *jia* direction. This illustrates the crucible where the metal’s virtue is complete, having received the fire time. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"On the fifteenth day, the *Qian* body is replete, full at *jia* in the east.\"\n\n\"Metal and water grow warm; the sun’s red marrow flows as mercury; the maiden plays with golden earrings; the moon waxes and naturally conjoins\": By this time, the divine elixir of liquid gold—with the sun’s essence now abundant—fills the divine chamber. The qi of metal and fire transforms into mercury, which, along with its mother, lingers in mutual affection, transmuting the golden body. Toad and hare essence intertwine, enveloping each other; their radiance illuminates the crucible. The maiden’s body naturally forms adornments, manifesting golden earrings—an analogy for the crucible where the metal qi gradually flourishes, transforming into the elixir. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Toad and hare essence—sun and moon, peerless in brightness. The toad, observing the hexagram’s nodes, spits forth radiant light.\"\n\nFrom the first to the fifteenth day of the great yin, the light fills; from the sixteenth day onward, it naturally conjoins. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"At seven and eight, the Dao is complete; bending and folding, it descends.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Sixteen: The Sixteenfold Mutual Diminution**\n\nThe sixteenfold mutual diminution: when Qian’s first line is diminished, it forms Feng, and the bright moon appears at Xin. When Qian’s second line is diminished, it forms Gen, and at twenty-three, the lower half-measure of water weighs half a catty, the moon emerging in the south at Bing. When Qian’s third line is diminished, it forms Kun, and on the thirtieth day, in the northeast, it loses its brightness, the moon setting at Yi-earth. As Kun and Yi-moon darken, earth, water, and metal are about to transform. Kun gives birth to Zhen the Dragon.\n\nMinister Dao’s annotation states: \"The sixteenfold mutual diminution—when Qian’s first line is diminished to form Feng, and the bright moon appears at Xin—refers to the period after the sixteenth day, when Kun interchanges with Qian’s lower line to form the Feng hexagram. Feng governs affairs: one yin line arises below as yang fire begins its retreat and yin tally first emerges. At dawn, the moon appears in the Xin direction, just as when yang fire first advances, the moon is three days old. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'At sixteenfold reception, Feng governs; Xin appears at dawn.'\n\nWhen Qian’s second line is diminished to form Gen, at twenty-three, the lower half-measure of water weighs half a catty, and the moon emerges in the south at Bing. From the sixteenth day, as yin tally retreats to the twenty-third, Kun interchanges with Qian’s middle line to form the Gen hexagram. Gen governs affairs: two yin lines arise in the center, and the moon appears in the Bing direction, again corresponding to the upper half-measure. This signifies that within the crucible, metal and water are evenly balanced. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Gen aligns with Bing in the south; the lower half-measure at twenty-three.'\n\nWhen Qian’s third line is diminished to form Kun, on the thirtieth day, in the northeast, it loses its brightness, the moon setting at Yi-earth. From the twenty-sixth to the twenty-eighth day, Kun interchanges with Qian’s upper line to form the Kun hexagram. Kun governs affairs: three yin lines arise above, and the moon’s light nears its end, appearing in the Yi direction. Reaching the northeast, yang light is entirely spent—this is called the loss of brightness. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Kun and Yi, on the thirtieth day, in the east, lose their brightness.'\n\nWhen Kun and Yi-moon darken, earth, wood, and metal are about to transform, and Kun gives birth to Zhen the Dragon. From the twenty-eighth to the thirtieth day, yin tally is exhausted, and the qi of yin and yang each come to rest. Earth, metal, and water combine into a liquid; the six yang qi do not unite with the moon. The body of Great Yin turns wholly dark, traversing the northeast and passing over Mao and Bi, where sun and moon conjoin. Water and fire are again applied, returning to their origin, taking Fu as the first hexagram. Kun transforms into Zhen, which pertains to wood and resides in the east—hence it is called the Dragon. Moreover, yang fire is the Dragon. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'When the node is exhausted, they alternate; with the transformation of the body, the Dragon is reborn.'\n\nMinister Dao’s commentary states: From Zi to Si, yang fire advances for six hours, governed by Zhen, Dui, and Qian—this is the movement of Great Yin, the image of metal liquid. Fu, Lin, Tai, Da Zhuang, and Guai, governed by Qian, are the movement of Great Yang, the image of yang fire. From Wu to Hai, yin tally retreats for six hours, governed by Feng, Gen, and Kun—this is the movement of Great Yin, the image of metal liquid. Gou, Dun, Pi, Guan, Bo, and Kun are the movement of Great Yin, the image of yin tally. The transformations of metal and water within the crucible are governed by twelve lines and twelve hours; the movements of the moon’s radiance in the heavens are governed by six hexagrams and twelve hours. The *Cantong Qi* speaks of this in great detail, yet people fail to perceive it clearly.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao, desiring to refine this Great Elixir, must understand astronomy above, geography below, and human nature within. Only then can they adapt to the transformations of creation, grasp yin and yang in hand, revolve the sun and moon within the furnace, and breed the Dragon and Tiger. They unite Qian and Kun within the chamber, nurturing essence and fluids. The Metal Mother labors without exhaustion; the Wood Father achieves success with ease. The metal liquid transforms, cinnabar mercury takes form, the nine revolutions conclude, and yang light changes—this is the Yellow Chariot, named the Dust of the Bright Window. Not only does it transmute cinnabar into gold, but when ingested, it equals heaven in longevity. The marvels of transformation cannot be surpassed.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Qian and Kun Encompass Beginning and End**\n\nQian and Kun encompass beginning and end—thus it is said: Zhen the Dragon. As above, over thirty days, Kun gives birth to Zhen, Dui, and Qian; Qian gives birth to Feng, Gen, and Kun. The eight hexagrams are arrayed, their luminous movements shifting without losing the center.\n\nMinister Dao’s annotation states: Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end—thus it is said: Zhen the Dragon. Qian and Kun are the father and mother of all hexagrams. The two hexagrams interweave to form the eight hexagrams: Qian first interchanges with Kun’s lower line to form Zhen, marking the new moon at the first day’s midnight, the Zi hour, the beginning of yang fire’s arising. Kun then interchanges with Qian’s lower line to form Feng, beginning at the sixteenth day’s midnight, the Zi hour, the start of yin tally’s arising. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Ren and Gui pair with Jia and Yi; Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end.'\n\nAs above, over thirty days, Kun gives birth to Zhen, Dui, and Qian: Kun gives birth to Zhen, governing the first five days as the direct tally; next, it gives birth to Dui, governing the middle five days as the direct tally; then, it gives birth to Qian, governing the last five days as the direct tally. Great Yang stands for fifteen days, reaching fullness at Jia above, and the metal liquid in the crucible also flourishes, increasing in accord with the hexagrams.\n\nQian gives birth to Feng, governing the first five days as the direct tally; next, it gives birth to Gen, governing the middle five days as the direct tally; then, it gives birth to Kun, governing the last five days as the direct tally. Great Yin stands for fifteen days, its light exhausted in the northeast, the Gen region, and the metal liquid in the crucible also reaches fullness, forming in accord with the hexagrams. Qian and Kun mutually generate and extinguish over thirty days, the cycle of one month. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond. The four together make thirty—yang qi seeks extinction and concealment.'\n\nThe eight hexagrams are arrayed, their luminous movements shifting without losing the center. As above, the eight hexagrams are arrayed within one month’s thirty days, moving yang fire and yin tally, each converging within the divine chamber to transform the Great Elixir and metal liquid. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'The eight hexagrams are arrayed; their luminous movements shift without losing the center.'\n\nMinister Dao’s commentary states: The human body also embodies heaven and earth. Within it, the ascent and descent of yin and yang likewise correspond to the transformations of creation. Yet, through the six desires and seven emotions, they are expressed externally, while essence and qi are depleted internally. All day long, one rushes about heedlessly, unaware of reflection. If one can know this Dao, follow yin and yang, and guard simplicity with tranquility, then heaven and earth will externally interact while the body internally harmonizes. Each will respond to its ascent and descent. With minimal thought and no harm, one will naturally prolong life. How much more so when establishing the furnace and crucible, modeling heaven and earth, summoning the essence of sun and moon, and drawing the harmonious qi of yin and yang to refine the divine medicine and ingest it—how could one not become an immortal?",

As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Toad and hare essence—sun and moon, peerless in brightness. The toad, observing the hexagram’s nodes, spits forth radiant light.\"\n\nFrom the first to the fifteenth day of the great yin, the light fills; from the sixteenth day onward, it naturally conjoins. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"At seven and eight, the Dao is complete; bending and folding, it descends.\"",

      "translated_text": "To craft the golden liquor, one must first understand the numerical degrees traversed by Qian and Kun in the eight trigrams over the course of a month—thirty days in total. The sun moves one degree per day, while the moon moves thirteen degrees. Though both complete one cycle in a month, they converge in the same palace, known as the new moon. The sun travels thirty degrees, and the moon three hundred ninety-five degrees, passing through twelve months before reuniting with the sun above the Dipper mansion on the winter solstice.\n\nThus, the perfected one uses the degrees of the sun and moon’s movement as the period for firing in one month: the first fifteen days are governed by Zhen, Dui, and Qian, while the latter fifteen are governed by Xun, Gen, and Kun. Kan and Li hold their positions, with yang fire and yin tally advancing or retreating according to the time, all in accordance with the symbolic lines of the trigrams.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Regulating the Fire for Sixty Days**\nRegulating the fire for sixty days brings about transformations that serve as proof. The divine chamber takes on a form resembling a chicken’s egg, with the Five Peaks standing in concealment and the cavern’s gate possessing a pivot and bolt.\n\nMinister Dao’s annotation: \"Regulating the fire for sixty days brings about transformations that serve as proof\" refers to the original essence within the crucible, whose state is difficult to observe. After completing one month’s cycle and opening the crucible, one may find golden blossoms descending or jade liquid congealing slowly—these are signs of excess or deficiency in yin tally and yang fire. Thus, another month of firing is required to complete the alchemical process.\n\nTherefore, as the original essence in the crucible receives the externally applied tally-fire, each transformation is subtle and hard to perceive. Yet by observing the twelve time-periods and the firing conditions of the trigrams, one can discern its movements, whether sinking or floating. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The original essence is subtle and hard to perceive; one infers its effects by observing the tally’s signs.\"\n\n\"The divine chamber takes on a form resembling a chicken’s egg\" means that the ancient perfected ones, gazing up at the celestial patterns and examining the earth’s principles, modeled the divine chamber after Heaven and Earth, shaping it like a chicken’s egg. Within its hollow center, a space of slightly over an inch is reserved for the numinous mercury. As the *Cantong Qi* says: \"When dwelling, observe its image and approximate its form.\"\n\n\"The Five Peaks stand in concealment, and the cavern’s gate possesses a pivot and bolt\" describes how the sacred mountains on earth are divided into the Five Peaks, all interconnected in hidden ways. The ancients established markers to serve as models, constructing altars, furnaces, crucibles, and stoves in accordance with the mysterious method, ensuring their intricate connections allowed the fire’s qi to circulate without obstruction. If the firing conditions scatter externally, fortune or misfortune arises internally. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Erect markers to serve as standards; observe the omens to determine fortune or misfortune.\"\n\nMinister Dao’s commentary: Before Heaven and Earth separated, their form resembled a chicken’s egg. After their separation, the yang fire ascended, and the light, pure qi congealed to form Heaven, while the yin water sank, and the heavy, turbid qi congealed to form Earth—this is called the fixed positions of Heaven and Earth. The divine chamber consists of an upper cauldron as Heaven and a lower cauldron as Earth, their two halves joined to resemble a chicken’s egg. Within its hollow center, slightly over an inch of space is called the fixed position of the divine chamber. When Heaven and Earth interact, fire is born within water and ascends, while water is born within fire and descends, converging within the true earth to produce medicinal substances. Similarly, in the divine chamber, fire arises from Kan and water descends from Li, converging within Wu and Ji to generate the numinous mercury—such profound and wondrous secrets can be known.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: The Initial Firing is Gentle and Subtle**\nThe initial firing is gentle and subtle, like the movement of a line in the trigrams. Above, it bears the essence of yellow gold; below, it carries the primordial Kun. Its form is harmonious, flowing with pure fluid, and when examined, it unites the Three Powers. Qian moves in response to the Three Luminaries, while Kun remains still, containing yang qi.\n\nMinister Dao’s annotation: \"The initial firing is gentle and subtle, like the movement of a line in the trigrams\" means that when initiating the divine elixir’s firing, one must follow the symbolic lines of the trigrams and align with the twelve months’ waxing and waning. For instance, the hexagram *Fu* (Return), representing the winter solstice, governs the season when the lowest line transforms into yang, corresponding to the *zi* hour.\n\nAt this time, the firing is not yet forceful but merely warm—this is called \"soft fire,\" corresponding to the initial generation of the single yang line in *Fu*. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Issue commands in accordance with the seasons; do not miss the time when the lines move.\"\n\n\"Above, it bears the essence of yellow gold; below, it carries the primordial Kun\" refers to yellow gold as Qian Heaven, the upper cauldron, and Kun as Kun Earth, the lower cauldron. The two cauldrons combine to form the divine chamber. As the *Cantong Qi* says: \"Above, examine the patterns of the *He Tu*; below, recount the earth’s forms.\"\n\n\"Its form is harmonious, flowing with pure fluid, and when examined, it unites the Three Powers\" means that once the divine chamber is positioned, the pure fluid and numinous mercury are generated within it. The numinous center of the middle palace also symbolizes the human heart-mind’s dwelling. Thus, when Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are complete, the myriad things are named, and the Five Agents are activated. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Examine the center in relation to the human heart, uniting the Three Powers.\"\n\n\"Qian moves in response to the Three Luminaries; Kun remains still, containing yang qi\" refers to Qian as Heaven, the sun, and fire.",

      "translated_text": "Within the empty vessel, as Qian’s primordial movement stirs, the essence of water and fire arises, producing the golden fluid. Kun is Earth, the moon, and water. As Kun’s primordial stillness abides, the essence of moon, water, and metal harmonizes with the flowing pearl of great yang, enclosing it to prevent its flight. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"In motion, it follows the changes of the hexagrams; in stillness, it adheres to the judgments of the *tuan*. When Qian and Kun are put into practice, how can one not proceed with utmost care?\"\n\nThe *Chendao Shu* says: The sun occupies the position of *Li*, dwelling in the south amid *Bing* and *Ding*—the true seat of fire. The sun also contains fire, and fire transforms its body to become mercury; thus, it is said that mercury is born from the sun. Mercury is yang, called the yang spirit. The *Li* hexagram consists of two yang lines and one yin line, with *Si* earth as its spirit, and it is also the middle daughter of Kun. The sun employs *Si* earth as its light—*Si* being a yin position—so its image corresponds to the *Li* hexagram. Moreover, the sun’s light contains a dark hue, which, shifting from blue to red, becomes cinnabar.\n\nThe moon belongs to the position of *Kan*, residing in the north amid *Ren* and *Gui*—the true seat of water. The moon also contains water and transforms its body to become metal; thus, it is said that metal is born from the moon. Metal is yin, called the yin soul. The *Kan* hexagram consists of two yin lines and one yang line, with *Wu* earth as its spirit, and it is also the middle son of Qian. The moon employs *Wu* earth as its essence—*Wu* earth being a yang position—so its image corresponds to the *Kan* hexagram. Moreover, the moon’s essence contains a pale hue, which, shifting from white to black, becomes black lead.\n\nMercury, containing the qi of *Li*, aligns with the position of the yin line. This mercury is not the common quicksilver or cinnabar of the world but originates within great yang; *Li* names it the water spirit, calling it true mercury. Lead, containing the qi of *Kan*, aligns with the position of the yang line. This lead is not the salt lead of Jiazhou or that found among rocks but originates within great yin; *Kan* names it white metal, calling it true lead.\n\nLead divides into two, forming the two poles of the divine chamber. Mercury arises from the one, the single qi of the dark fluid. Together, they image the Three Powers as Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\n\n*Guwen Longhu Jing Zhushu*, Middle Scroll\n*Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu*\n*Guwen Longhu Jing Zhushu*, Lower Scroll\nBy Wang Dao of the Song Dynasty\nChapter Twenty: \"The Divine Chamber’s Prior Practice\"",

The qi of refinement and transformation envelops and congeals in flight; the numinous portal opens and closes, the abode of the subtle and imperceptible, the cavern of creation and transformation.\n\nMinister Dao’s Annotation: \"Only after first applying the golden elixir can completion be firm\" means that once the Divine Chamber is established and its method attained, the golden liquid necessarily follows the principle of completion. \"Can it not be firm? The qi of refinement and transformation envelops and congeals in flight\" signifies that the adept refining the elixir must first firmly prepare the crucible and vessel, ensuring the numinous mercury within solidifies and congeals without escaping, only then can the elixir be formed. \"The numinous portal opens and closes, the abode of the subtle and imperceptible, the cavern of creation and transformation\" describes how the Divine Chamber possesses upper and lower cauldrons: when open, they are two; when closed, they are one. Within, the void space allows water and fire to interact, and the numinous substance is born. Thus, it is called the subtle and imperceptible. White metal becomes the elixir and generates mercury, termed the golden liquid. This is the treasury and cavern of the elixir.\n\nMinister Dao’s Exegesis: The water of the north generates and completes white metal, calling it true lead, the essence of utmost yin. It contains the harmonious yang, following the qi of primordial chaos as it divides and returns each to its original unity. The perfected of antiquity modeled the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s generation and completion, returning the harmonious yang qi to true lead, containing its natural function to refine the great medicine. This is the qi of true origin, not something worldly substances can achieve. If the methods of cultivation and refinement are correct and the system reasonable, how can one fail to complete the great elixir? The dragon and tiger, both born within lead, through the ascent and descent of water and fire, cause metal and wood to interact in the abode of the subtle and imperceptible. The cavern of creation and transformation guards the waxing and waning of the sun and moon. White metal, as mother, envelops the multitude of spirits to produce the supreme treasure.\n\nChapter Twenty-One: \"Yang Qi Arises in Kun\"\nYang qi arises in Kun; the sundial points to the southern extreme. The five stars form a pearl string; the sun and moon unite as jade discs. Golden sand adheres to its division, breathing in resonance.\n\nMinister Dao’s Annotation: \"Yang qi arises in Kun; the sundial points to the southern extreme\" refers to the end of the tenth month, when the pure Kun hexagram concludes, and the beginning of the eleventh month, the midnight hour of the zi period, when the Kun hexagram’s lower line generates one yang line, forming the Fu hexagram—this is the time when yang fire is born. Progressing through chou, yin, and reaching si, yang qi reaches its extreme in the south, then yin arises at wu. \"The five stars form a pearl string; the sun and moon unite as jade discs\" describes how the five stars traverse the celestial circuit like a string of pearls, with varying speeds, stations, retrogradations, and progressions. The sun and moon’s degrees converge once a month in union, their jade-disc conjunction aligning with the five stars to mutually verify the year’s use of metal and fire. \"Golden sand adheres to its division, breathing in resonance\" means golden sand is the essence of the sun and moon. As water and fire ascend and descend, inhaling and exhaling, golden sand in the crucible rises and sinks, following the rhythm of breath to resonate with the externally applied fire.\n\nMinister Dao’s Exegesis: True lead is the mother, Kun, the body of great yin, perpetually dark. Only upon encountering yang fire does it take form. Once formed, it traverses the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines, transforming endlessly, all following the numerical movements of the sun, moon, and five stars. If one uses miscellaneous substances for the elixir, how can it follow the yin-yang and four seasons to generate? As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The sun contains the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the discipline of the six pitch-pipes.\"\n\nChapter Twenty-Two: \"The Canopy of Flowers Descends\"\nThe canopy of flowers descends; the Three Terraces assist below. They govern the records and administrations, ensuring firmness and scrutinizing competence.\n\nMinister Dao’s Annotation: \"The canopy of flowers descends; the Three Terraces assist below, governing the records and administrations, ensuring firmness and scrutinizing competence\" describes how the canopy of flowers, sixteen stars shaped like a cover, resides in the Purple Tenuity Palace, corresponding to the imperial throne. The Three Terraces, six stars outside the Purple Tenuity Palace, regulate the harmony of yin and yang and the governance of the myriad things, likened to water and fire residing in the golden crucible above and below. If harmony and regulation are proper, the numinous essence descends within. The Three Terraces govern the records and administrations, leading the hundred officials, akin to the prime minister’s duty, also called Wenchang. If the five stars shrink or expand improperly, the sun and moon advance or retreat irregularly, the four seasons fail to respond, and wind and rain arrive untimely, causing the myriad things not to grow—this is like the adept refining the elixir who, if their operations are irregular, causes the crucible to dry or overflow, leading to constant anomalies and the failure of the elixir. If all seasonal nodes are mastered as if turning in the palm, the crucible is firmly sealed without mishap. If even one aspect is mismanaged, the competence of the fire’s application is scrutinized. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Wenchang governs the records; the terraces and assistants, the hundred officials and offices, each oversee their respective domains.\"\n\nMinister Dao’s Exegesis: Many in the world study the Dao, yet those who grasp its wondrous principles are one in ten thousand. Some feign its name to pursue illicit gain; some falsely claim to transmute yellow and white, engaging in alchemical deceptions. Others recklessly point to ancient texts, refining the five metals and eight minerals in hopes of fortuitously obtaining the great medicine, wasting years and exhausting spirit, yet achieving nothing. The foolish compound their errors; the wise diminish their conduct. They cling to delusion until death, never repenting, bewildered and entangled without end. Some lose their professions, squander their wealth, forfeit parental care, sever spousal love, drifting in hunger and cold—such cases span generations. Little do they know that the golden mother and great medicine are not crafted from common lead or mercury but are the spirit of Heaven and Earth, the souls of the sun and moon. How can one fail to enter its domain?\n\nChapter Twenty-Three: \"Fire Refines the Central Palace Earth\"\nFire refines the central palace earth; metal enters the northern water. Water, earth, and metal—three substances transform over sixty days, the essentials of natural generation and decay. If the fire count is excessive or the weights deviate, mercury may become unstable, dwelling apart or resisting harmony. Hard and soft contend, failing to interpenetrate—this is not fire’s fault but earth’s reprimand.\n\nMinister Dao’s Annotation: \"Fire refines the central palace earth; metal enters the northern water\" means fire is the sun, metal the moon. The two natures of metal and fire follow the qi of the five phases and six pitch-pipes to generate. Thus, fire generates earth, and metal generates water, each exhaling its essence to become the divine medicine. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The sun contains the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the discipline of the six pitch-pipes.\" \"Water, earth, and metal—three substances transform over sixty days\" describes how the central palace contains only the golden mother, while water and earth, two substances, harmonize through the fire’s timing. If in one month the fire’s timing does not align with the mother’s count, another month of firing is required. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Five times six makes thirty degrees; once completed, it begins anew.\" \"The essentials of natural generation and decay\" mean the golden liquid divine elixir entirely depends on the fire’s timing. Fire is the medicine’s parent; the medicine is fire’s progeny, naturally generated by the qi of Heaven and Earth.",

      "translated_text": "If the fire’s power is evenly maintained, it generates golden mercury; if the fire’s power is misaligned, it instead leads to dispersion and loss, with unpredictable preservation or decay—this must be measured within sixty days to determine its beginning and end. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"To trace the origin and grasp the end, to discern the threads of preservation and decay.\"\n\nIf the fire’s count is excessive or the weights deviate, when the yang fire’s count is too great, the spirit and qi are harmed, causing the golden mercury to overflow and overfill the crucible, violating the proper measure. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"If the lord grows arrogant and overbearing, he strays from the Dao.\"\n\nIf the mercury is unstable, now dwelling together, now apart, this mercury is the golden liquid. Should the fire’s count err, the mercury within the crucible chamber will follow the fire’s fluctuations, failing to adhere to the proper path—thus it may unite or separate unpredictably. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"If the minister is treacherous and perverse, his conduct does not follow the proper track.\"\n\nWhen hardness and softness contend without mutual penetration, the fault does not lie with the fire but is imputed to the earth. If the golden sand does not arise according to measure, hardness and softness fail to interpenetrate—not solely the fire’s error, but also because the central palace’s golden mother is impure, her essence and qi slightly lost. Thus, the fault is not ascribed to fire but to earth. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When the waxing and waning of the moon deviate, misfortune arises; the enforcer of the law reproaches and interrogates, blaming the ruler.\"\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: Those who refine the elixir must understand the movements of the sun and moon, comprehend the principles of yin and yang’s ascent and descent, grasp the withdrawal and addition of the fire’s timing, and distinguish the authenticity of medicinal substances—only then can success be assured. This truly depends on the person who regulates the fire’s timing. If one is ignorant of these matters and enforces the method inconsistently, blaming the inadequacy of the oral transmission or criticizing the master’s teachings without self-realization—those who cherish the Dao should take heed of this.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Earth Ruling the Central Palace**\n\nEarth rules the central palace, enveloping the four directions; the three luminaries align to bring great peace. The five viscera are internally nourished, the four limbs harmonized; water dries, fire extinguishes, inner radiance is contained, and brilliance shines within. Metal and wood mutually refine, their flow sealed; by regulating water and warming fire, all transform, and the Dao may be sought nearby.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: \"Earth rules the central palace, enveloping the four directions\"—earth is wu and ji, the mother. The mother resides in the central palace, summoning the harmonious qi of the four directions into the divine chamber to transform into the golden liquid. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The pole star stands at the center, like the golden mother, who can leisurely embrace all subjects.\" Thus it says: \"The pole star stands at the center, leisurely governing below.\"\n\n\"The three luminaries align to bring great peace\"—the three luminaries are the sun, moon, and stars. If the three luminaries advance and retreat without error above, the world below attains great peace, commands are executed, prohibitions upheld, and the state suffers no disorder. The internal operation of the elixir also possesses three luminaries: the yang fire, yin water, and golden embryo, which symbolize the sun, moon, and stars. Thus, the external operation also has three luminaries, distributed within the moving and static lines, the moments and breaths, the yin and yang symbols, and the fire’s timing. If the regulation of the symbols is correct, there will be no harm of escape—like governing a state to achieve great peace. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The bright hall enacts governance; the state suffers no harm—this is the Dao.\"\n\n\"The five viscera are internally nourished, the four limbs harmonized\"—if the regulation of the symbolic fire fully accords with the celestial degrees, then within the crucible chamber, the true person’s body, the five viscera and four limbs are harmonized and at peace, tranquil and empty, serene and desireless, attaining the center—thus there is no risk of premature death. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Internally, one nurtures oneself in stillness and emptiness.\"\n\n\"Water dries, fire extinguishes, inner radiance is contained\"—when refining the great elixir, at the *si* hour, water dries; at the *hai* hour, fire extinguishes. By these two hours, the essence and qi of metal and fire each attain their proper state, their brilliance pervading the chamber, illuminating the true person’s body. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Tracing the origin to its brightness, it illuminates the body within.\"\n\n\"Metal and wood mutually refine, their flow sealed\"—the qi of dragon and tiger intermingle, the natures of metal and wood harmonize. Metal comes to restrain wood; wood, though restrained by metal, becomes radiant, causing its brilliance to be sealed within the crucible, the numinous root enclosed in the chamber—all nurtured and transformed by the golden mother. The golden mother’s transformations are unfathomable; this subtlety is difficult to convey without oral transmission. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Seal its opening, fortify the numinous root.\"\n\n\"By regulating fire and warming water, all transform, and the Dao may be sought nearby\"—the golden mother within the crucible gathers the qi of the three luminaries and the essence of the sun and moon, giving birth to the sacred embryo, whose form is inscrutable. The numinous mercury of the child and root resides in the divine chamber, hidden and difficult to perceive. If the fire does not lose its timing and water does not lose its measure, water and fire both follow the Dao, ascending and descending according to principle, conforming to the celestial mechanism and the model of the law—then the golden mercury will naturally cherish the dragon and tiger’s natures, their essences intermingling. Seeking its transformations by analogy, the principle of the Dao becomes visible. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The three luminaries sink into obscurity; by warming and nurturing, the child-pearl is unseen—nearby and easily sought.\"\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: Human principles can be inferred by analogy. Before the essence of the three luminaries appears and the qi of the four images separates, the mysterious yellow is in chaos, clear and turbid undivided, the qi of true lead mixed within. Once the clear is used for heaven and the turbid for earth, the harmony of yin and yang forms humanity—thus the three powers are established. The qi of true lead resides in the center, at the position of wu and ji, becoming the mother of the divine medicine, enveloping the qi of metal, wood, water, and fire to congeal into the golden liquid. Among the five phases, metal comes to restrain wood; within wood is fire, which counter-restrains metal. Metal and fire mutually restrain, refining each other. Water comes to restrain fire; within fire is earth, which counter-restrains water. Water and earth mutually pair, transforming each other—this principle of mutual generation and restraint lies in oral transmission and cannot be written. If sought through the celestial Dao, it is merely a single taste of primordial harmony.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Water and Earth Alone Pairing**\n\nWater and earth alone pair; kingfishers give birth amidst auspicious clouds. The yellow and black blend the primordial essence; purple flowers unfold in the great yang. Water alone can generate the myriad things—only the sage knows this.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: \"Water and earth alone pair; kingfishers give birth amidst auspicious clouds\"—water is the mysterious water, earth is the golden mother. When the fire of the great yang unites with the golden mother, within the divine chamber, the essence of wood transforms into qi, giving rise to auspicious clouds, gradually congealing into flowing pearls that moisten the elixir palace to transform into the golden liquid. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The yellow center gradually opens; the principle moistens and reaches the skin.\"",

As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When the beginning is correct, the end is cultivated; the stem is established, and the fruit may be held.\"\n\nThat water alone can generate the myriad things, and only the sage knows this—water is the first of the numbers, the mysterious heaven generates water, which resides in the north. Within water, metal is born, and metal in turn generates water. The sage, knowing this, models its image to refine the divine elixir, which the foolish and ignorant cannot fathom. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The One is used to conceal it; the world does not know.\"\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: The Qian and Kun, the two bodies, envelop the mysterious image. Heaven’s One generates water, called mysterious water; earth’s Five generates soil, called true earth. When water and earth unite, they give birth to the myriad things. The sage, understanding this transformation, models heaven and earth to establish the divine chamber, aligning with yin and yang to employ water and fire. Following the patterns of the hexagrams, traversing the four seasons, the primordial essence is born, and the divine mercury emerges.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Virtue of Metal Prefers White**\nThe virtue of metal prefers white; refining lead seeks the yellow hue. Through resonance, it generates within the central palace, where yellow gold melts without flying, and scorched earth gives rise to clouds of smoke.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: \"The virtue of metal prefers white; refining lead seeks the yellow hue\"—refining lead produces white metal, and white metal forms the divine chamber. Within the divine chamber lies metal-water, which, transformed by fire, changes its color to yellow, called the Yellow Chariot. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Below lies the qi of the great yang, steaming for a moment; first it liquefies, then congeals, named the Yellow Chariot.\"\n\n\"Through resonance, it generates within the central palace, where yellow gold melts without flying, and scorched earth gives rise to clouds of smoke\"—as the golden liquid is about to form, it congeals with water and fire within the vessel. Originating from metal, it transforms into liquid, resonating and coalescing in the central palace, so the liquid of yellow gold naturally does not escape. Fire scorches the golden essence, and the pure qi becomes clear and luminous, sometimes manifesting as light smoke or thin mist within the crucible chamber, its transformations boundless. It may resemble stalactites hanging inverted, or interlocking canine teeth; it may take the form of the sun and moon, revealing both hun and po, or transform into the shapes of dragons and tigers, where metal and water unite, and spirits manifest in myriad forms beyond description. If one were to use the five metals, eight stones, or various other杂 substances to create this, how could such divine transformations be attained?\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: Among all things in the world, only yellow gold cannot be destroyed. Since the beginning of creation, only the body of metal remains undiminished. Thus, the mother of yellow gold is called true lead. True lead is the One of pre-heaven; before the separation of chaos, the qi of lead resided within it. When heaven and earth took form, the body of lead also appeared. If the myriad things lacked the qi of lead, they could not achieve their wondrous functions. Therefore, the qi of true lead is omnipresent.\n\nMoreover, black metal generates white metal, white metal generates yellow metal, and yellow metal generates the supreme medicine. If one ingests it, one’s lifespan aligns with heaven and earth, and one’s body merges with the Dao. Thus, the essence of metal’s virtue is the master of all medicines and the origin of the myriad things.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Existence and Non-Existence Mutually Restrain**\nExistence and non-existence mutually restrain; above dwells the Green Dragon, residing in the two non-existences’ origin. The One’s numinous transformation is wondrous and difficult to perceive.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: \"Existence and non-existence mutually restrain; above dwells the Green Dragon\"—existence refers to white metal, and non-existence refers to the qi of fire. Thus, existence and non-existence interact, mutually restraining and uniting metal and water to generate the numinous mercury within the central palace. Mercury is the Green Dragon. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"When the upper is closed, it is called existence; when the lower is closed, it is called non-existence. Non-existence serves to uphold the upper, where the divine power resides.\"\n\n\"The two non-existences’ origin, the One’s numinous transformation is wondrous and difficult to perceive\"—the two non-existences are the qi of yin and yang, the hun and po of the sun and moon. The One’s existence is also the divine embryo. Within the divine embryo, there are no杂 substances, only an empty vessel. Through the qi of water and fire, it draws the essence of the sun and moon, uniting the purest of yin and yang to enter the divine embryo. The numinous transformation of the golden liquid is beyond perception. Above and below the divine chamber, the qi of water and fire, through the nurturing of the metal mother, mutually require each other to generate. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"These two apertures follow the method; the qi of metal also mutually requires this.\"\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: The golden liquid, named the Yellow Chariot, is the name of the ninefold transmutation. The ancients, when ingesting the elixir, first purified themselves through fasting and inner clarity, then consumed the outer elixir, so that inner and outer were both perfected. The true qi steamed and suffused the four limbs, reversing aging to return to youth, becoming a body of pure yang, and attaining a lifespan equal to heaven.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Refining Silver from Lead**\nRefining silver from lead, the divine substance generates itself. Silver is the essence of metal; lead envelops the northern numen. Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named the One, the beginning of yin and yang. Thus, it harbors silver’s essence, and lead transforms into yellow cinnabar, residing among the five metals as lead. Externally black, it embodies the north’s direction; internally, it harbors metal’s essence, clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade—outwardly a madman.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao* commentary states: \"Refining silver from lead, the divine substance generates itself\"—white metal has not yet revealed its form, concealed within the northern mysterious water. If one knows how to extract the great medicine’s foundation from within white metal and black lead, and moves according to the celestial patterns, then the divine substance will naturally generate. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Know the white, guard the black, and the divine illumination will come of itself.\"\n\n\"Silver is the essence of metal; lead envelops the northern numen\"—the essence of metal is white metal, and the foundation of mysterious water is true lead. It constantly envelops the true mercury of the northern water. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water.\"\n\n\"Water is the pivot of the Dao, the beginning of yin and yang, thus harboring silver’s essence\"—white metal is born from water and used as a divine vessel. The body of water is inexhaustible, and the mutual affinity of metal and water serves as the pivot, the root of yin and yang. Thus, it is the essence of silver, and the essence of silver is the medicine. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named the One, the beginning of yin and yang.\"\n\n\"Lead transforms into yellow cinnabar, residing among the five metals\"—lead is also called the mysterious position, residing in the Kan direction. The qi of water, fire, metal, and wood converge within lead, making it the master of the five metals and eight stones. When flowing pearls encounter it, they take root, all formed by the congealing of water and fire’s qi. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The mysterious contains the yellow sprout, the master of the five metals, the northern river chariot.\"\n\n\"Lead is externally black, embodying the north, internally harboring silver’s essence\"—lead’s exterior is black and coarse, yet within it lies the golden essence, constantly residing in the northern Ren and Gui positions.",
      "overlap_context": "one pair; kingfishers give birth amidst auspicious clouds\"—water is the mysterious water, earth is the golden mother. When the fire of the great yang unites with the golden mother, within the divine chamber, the essence of wood transforms into qi, giving rise to auspicious clouds, gradually congealing into flowing pearls that moisten the elixir palace to transform into the golden liquid. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The yellow center gradually opens; the principle moistens and reaches the skin.\"",

      "translated_text": "As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Thus lead is externally black yet internally harbors golden essence.\" \"Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade, outwardly a madman\"—before true lead is stabilized through refinement, it lies concealed within ore, its black exterior enveloping inner brilliance, akin to one robed in humble garb yet bearing treasure. The *Cantong Qi* declares: \"Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade, outwardly a madman,\" precisely this meaning.\n\nThe *Chendao Shu* explains: The crucible is the elixir; the elixir is the crucible. Crucible and elixir are one. If the Way of golden liquor could be accomplished without minerals, then those who ingested it would ascend as immortals in great numbers. Thus the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Cast aside the eight stones of Wudu, discard them\"—from this we know the great elixir employs neither the five metals nor the eight stones, nor malachite, realgar, or cinnabar. As for those golden elixirs that turn from red to purple, they are merely tainted by the qi of malachite or realgar. Moreover, when the primordial qi of nature generates the branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits of plants, their vibrant hues—are these dyed by malachite or realgar? An ancient poem says:\n\n*How wondrous the blooming flower,*\n*Red buds amid green leaves—*\n*Who has dyed them thus?*\n*Know that Creation’s fire*\n*Kindles stems and branches,*\n*Flowers and leaves unfurling—*\n*All transformations wrought by water, fire, and earth’s qi.*\n\nThe Way of the golden elixir is likewise: following the principle of Heaven and Earth’s generation, uniting the natural methods of metal and wood, if water, fire, and earth are gathered into one household, how could there be no transformation? Among the myriad arts, some employ the five metals, eight stones, saltpeter, alum, copper powder, and other minerals, yet for the numinous liquor of gold and mercury, such minerals have no application. If those who refine the great elixir comprehend this profound mystery of the Dao and the true lead’s place of origin, then the golden liquor will unfailingly form. Thus the Perfected Liu Zhigu states: \"Dragon and tiger are gold and mercury. When golden liquor enfolds them, attaining their natural nature, how could its ingestion not be wondrous?\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Silver as the Mother of Lead**\nSilver is the mother of lead; the mother resides within lead. Lead is the child of silver; the child conceals the silver’s womb. Ethereal and distant, it seems both present and absent. In the ash pool, with blazing heat, lead sinks while silver floats, pure and white, revealing the treasure that can forge the yellow chariot.\n\nThe *Chendao* annotation states: \"Silver is the mother of lead; the mother resides within lead\"—silver is metal, lead is water. Water is born from metal, and metal in turn conceals its form within lead-water. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Metal is the mother of water; the mother nurtures the child’s embryo,\" precisely this.\n\n\"Lead is the child of silver; the child conceals the silver’s womb\"—silver is the child, water; lead is the mother, metal. Since metal generates water, the child-water again dwells within the lead-mother, hence called black lead. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Water is the child of metal; the child conceals the mother’s womb,\" precisely this. After black lead transforms in quality, it lodges in the west, ever tracing its path within water, where it receives water’s nourishment and increasingly manifests its generative power. Named black lead, when refined into white metal and made into a divine chamber, the yang fire’s stimulation causes the child-water to flow forth from the white metal, called true mercury.\n\nGreat indeed! This true substance is the one qi that generates Heaven and Earth.",

      "translated_text": "The true essence, vast and distant, seems both present and absent—this is the true essence, the true mercury. Within the mother’s womb, pressed and pursued by external signs, it flickers between existence and non-existence, rising and sinking without constancy. Concealed by the crucible-chamber, its form and appearance cannot be seen. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"The true person’s utmost subtlety is as if present, as if absent,\" precisely this.\n\nIn the ash-pool, flames scorch: lead sinks, silver floats. The ash-pool’s fire blazes, lead sinks below, silver rises above—called white metal. The *True One’s Child* says: The true mercury within the divine crucible, steamed and fumigated by yang fire and yin signs, flies and hides without constancy, now sinking, now floating. The divine chamber is like a great abyss. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Vaguely resembling a great abyss, now sinking, now floating,\" precisely this.\n\nPure white, the treasure appears—it can be fashioned into the yellow chariot. The ash-pool forges and refines it into white metal; taking white metal to make the divine chamber, one can craft the yellow chariot. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Gather it when white, fashion it to become vermilion,\" precisely this.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao in Exposition* says: The essence of golden liquid lies in the divine water, the flower-pool—the flower-pool is the mother of metal. Metal is the white metal of the west; within this metal is liquid mercury. The radiant pearl of the Great Yang and these two substances, though each has its form, share a single source. The perfected person nurtures the metal and mercury, transforming them into cinnabar—this is returning to the root and reverting to the source, restoring the nature of spontaneity. The white metal, divine mother, nurtures the great elixir. Once the great elixir is formed, its fluids never cease, hence called golden liquid. Those who cherish the Dao must examine and scrutinize this carefully. One cannot simply mix mountain silver and mercury and call it \"nurturing mercury.\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The Shell Becomes Metal-Essence**\nThe shell becomes metal-essence; water returns as yellow liquid. A substance the width of an inch blends the Three Powers. Before Heaven and Earth divided, its form resembled a chicken’s egg.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao in Annotation* says: \"The shell becomes metal-essence; water returns as yellow liquid\"—true lead is refined into white metal, and white metal is made into the crucible-vessel, the mother of metal-essence. Within it lies mercury, which can transform into yellow liquid. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Refined to become its outer defense, white within, the true resides,\" precisely this.\n\n\"A substance the width of an inch blends the Three Powers\"—the divine chamber is hollow, square or round, slightly over an inch. The upper cauldron is Heaven, the lower cauldron is Earth, and within, the numinous mercury embodies the Three Powers. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Square and round, an inch in width, blending and supporting one another,\" precisely this.\n\n\"Before Heaven and Earth divided, its form resembled a chicken’s egg\"—before Heaven and Earth opened, the primordial chaos was like the shape of a chicken’s egg. The essence of the sun and moon intertwined within it, and the forms of the myriad phenomena began to emerge. The perfected person points to the divine chamber, symbolizing the primordial chaos, to embody the function of the Three Powers. Advancing yang fire and withdrawing yin signs, they retain the essence of the sun and moon. True lead existed before Heaven and Earth; gathering it has its method, crafting it has its principle—it cannot be done recklessly. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and revered,\" precisely this.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao in Exposition* says: Once white metal is revealed, it resembles white horse’s teeth. Its nature delights in consuming the essence of wood, for wood is born from the water of the north. After forging and refining, it becomes pure as snow—truly the treasure of the elixir. Master Tao says: \"Refine treasure with treasure; the aspirant attains the Dao.\" Ge Zhichuan says: \"Stone liquid, demon liquid, metal-essence, mountain treasures\"—examining this, it is also \"pure white, the treasure appears.\" Since it is called pure white and also called the treasure, it can be used to craft the golden liquid divine elixir. Today’s people burn cinnabar and mercury; even if they master the method of subduing fire, their fundamental nature remains. Though they may ingest it, how can cinnabar enter the five viscera and disperse like mist, wind, and rain?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Rising High at the Center**\nRising high at the center, its form resembles Penglai. The gates are subtly sealed, the numinous operates within. The furnace and hearth take their form from solid density and complete firmness, bending and restraining one another to ensure no mishap. This is the principle of spontaneity, the divine transformation without limit.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao in Annotation* says: \"Rising high at the center, its form resembles Penglai\"—in cultivating the great elixir, one must first arrange the altar, furnace, crucible, and hearth, upper and lower connected like the form of Penglai. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Beside it lies a level expanse, resembling Penglai,\" precisely this.\n\n\"The gates are subtly sealed, the numinous operates within\"—the crucible’s interior is circular and open on all sides to receive the fire’s qi. The gates are tightly sealed to prevent any loss. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Encircling, sealing, open on all sides, hesitating,\" precisely this.\n\n\"The furnace and hearth take their form from solid density and complete firmness\"—on the altar is the furnace, on the furnace is the hearth, in the hearth is the crucible, in the crucible is the divine chamber, and within the divine chamber, metal and water envelop one another to block evil and allow the numinous mercury to arise easily. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Guard and defend, solid and dense, blocking evil,\" precisely this.\n\n\"Bending and restraining one another to ensure no mishap\"—the metal crucible hangs within the hearth, its four sides hollowed to disperse the fire’s qi. Water is placed above the metal crucible, fire is moved below the metal crucible, and the altar, furnace, crucible, and hearth envelop one another to prevent accidents. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Curving and joining, connected to guard against mishap,\" precisely this.\n\n\"This is the principle of spontaneity, the divine transformation without limit\"—in crafting the great medicine, all are the essence of the sun, moon, and stars, the qi of the Five Phases and Four Images, becoming golden liquid—there is no other Dao.\n\nThe *Minister’s Dao in Exposition* says: The perfected person pities those who do not know the Dao, drowning in profit and rushing toward death, unaware of where the numinous goes or where the nature resides. This is why the essence of golden liquid is transmitted. Even the Yellow Emperor and Laozi practiced this Dao, becoming teachers for later generations. Those who ingest the elixir achieve long life, soaring and transforming, entering fire without burning, entering water without soaking—this is it. The rulers who governed before the Yellow Emperor all mastered this Dao, passing it down in succession—not only those who wandered beyond the world pursued this path.\n\nLater generations grew shallow and impure, the method became quite secret, and those who obtained it were rare. By the Zhou dynasty, Laozi descended into the world to cross the Pass, first bestowing the method of golden liquid solely upon the Pass Guardian, the Perfected Yin. From then on, it spread through the world. Those with karmic affinity encounter it and pass it down in succession, unbroken. The seed of the Dao—today’s people are otherwise: wealth and nobility make them arrogant, fame and profit enslave their nature, wine and excess stifle their qi, lust and desire confuse their emotions. Beyond the four pleasures, they fear only death. Thus, they recklessly seek to prolong life, paying homage to masters of arts and techniques in pursuit of the medicine of immortality. Hearing of this, those with devious motives rush in, acting haughtily as if they were masters, remaining silent and secretive, treating the profound as something to be concealed, causing chaos and making the truth difficult to discern. They take peripheral and minor arts, falsely claiming them as the supreme Dao, and borrow the names of minerals, plants, and trees to pass off as true medicine—yet they achieve no effect. That later generations do not believe in the method of golden liquid is hardly surprising.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Lodestone Attracts Iron**\n\nThe lodestone attracts iron, its influence penetrating barriers in hidden communion—how much more so when the egg’s pairing gives birth? The virtue of metal and earth ever abides with mercury.\n\nYour servant Dao annotates: The lodestone’s power, though whole, can draw several catties of iron beyond vessels—this is the mutual resonance of things. As the *Cantong Qi* states: *\"The profound and distant, though separated by barriers, remain connected.\"* As for the egg’s pairing giving birth: crafting a divine chamber from white metal to resemble an egg’s form, like the union of Heaven and Earth, moving water and fire so that numinous mercury is born. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Like an egg, black and white support each other.\"* Moreover, within Heaven and Earth there is the Great Yin’s mysterious essence, transforming myriad forms and infusing all things above. Whether great or small, none exist without it. The perfected refine and consume it to arrest the light and cultivate immortality.\n\nThe method to refine it relies solely on white metal, whose power alone can restrain it, allowing it to linger and solidify into transformation. The virtue of metal and earth ever dwells with mercury: metal is Qian, earth is Kun. When Qian and Kun stir in emotion, mercury and lead are born, uniting as golden liquid without fleeing. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Movement and stillness, rest and activity, ever accompany man.\"*\n\nYour servant Dao elucidates: The ancient perfected ones’ profound methods lay in refining the golden crucible. If one can comprehend this, one may summon the qi of myriad transformations and know the essence of golden liquid. Suppose, before the primordial chaos, when form and substance were undivided, the state of Heaven and Earth resembled an egg—grasping its root and establishing it as the supreme Dao. Thus, before Heaven and Earth, at the origin of the myriad things, this art was the first attained. Those who obtain it stand alone for eternity, their spirit and form uncorrupted—this is hardly difficult.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Fire Record Is No False Composition**\n\nThe Fire Record is no false composition, nor does it redundantly reiterate previous texts. Since the elixir arts are already expounded, they are not repeated here; thus, this formula is appended to the Fire Record.\n\nYour servant Dao annotates: The Fire Record is no false composition, nor does it redundantly reiterate previous texts. The Fire Record comprises six hundred chapters, sequentially arranged to operate the ten-month fire regimen. Each month has thirty days, with a hexagram for day and night, totaling sixty hexagrams—ten months thus yield six hundred hexagrams. The second and eighth months also have chapters, but since the third month’s water stabilizes metal and the tenth month’s fire ceases water, they align with the first and seventh months, hence not included in the count. This is the ancient text of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*, where the Fire Record was transmitted orally by the ancients—no false composition, thus emphasized. As the elixir method states: *\"The medicine is transmitted, not the fire.\"* Since the Fire Record was composed earlier, it is not restated in this scripture, and this formula is appended to it. This scripture was transmitted solely through ancient texts, without recording the author’s name. The ancients who attained the Dao feared the Fire Record would be lost, leaving later generations unable to refine the golden liquid, so they composed this scripture to append to it.\n\nYour servant Dao elucidates: Those who study the Dao in this world fail to grasp the root of golden liquid and cling to peripheral paths, wasting their lives in vain. Some sit rigidly, visualizing, swallowing saliva, inhaling breath, pointing to the Great Abyss as a single aperture, imagining the cinnabar field below the navel, or silently listening for numinous sounds, dividing them into lead and mercury, uniting heart and kidney as water and fire—these are but the studies of beginners. Others practice bedroom arts of qi absorption and supplementation, exchanging yin and yang, exhaling and inhaling, refining inner elixirs—yet as their blood and qi deplete, they invite calamity, their decaying forms turning to dust. Such misguided paths are numerous, all straying from the Dao, advancing yet retreating, hastening yet delaying, obscuring the utmost truth and violating Heaven’s principle. Viewed thus, they are deeply pitiable.\n\nThis scripture begins with the dragon and tiger: the dragon is the sun, the tiger is the moon. Sun and moon are the ancestors of Qian and Kun’s movement, the root of the myriad things’ birth. Qian is the metal body of Heaven, its color azure-green, containing yin and yang, harmonizing the four images, the three luminaries, and the two qi, all operating within it. The ancients emulated Heaven and Earth’s movement, the sun and moon’s separation and union, establishing the furnace and crucible, gathering the light of the two luminaries, summoning the dragon and tiger’s qi into the divine chamber, refining it into medicine, called the golden elixir—hence the name *Dragon-Tiger*. Master Wei said: *\"The dragon’s spirit sings where the spring’s light clouds weave the sky; the tiger’s roar stirs the void’s rushing wind. The yang burning-mirror shines, crimson fire rises; the yin dew-receiver reveals the mysterious overflow—all occurs naturally.\"*\n\nThe Way of the golden elixir’s transformations is fundamentally one. If one relies on the five metals, eight stones, various lead ores, or visualizations to gather inner elixirs, hoping to ascend in broad daylight, is this not difficult? Moreover, this scripture’s three chapters contain vulgar and coarse language, with some characters incorrect—all later additions under false names. I have excised them, aligning with Master Wei’s *Cantong Qi* to divide it into thirty-three chapters, so later scholars may follow its sequence without error.\n\nThough the mountains and forests harbor lofty recluses, and the court and markets teem with great talents, can there be no hope for those who deeply cultivate the Dao, verifying it against the *Cantong Qi*?\n\n**Ancient Text of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*, Annotated and Elucidated, Volume Three**\n**Fire Regimen of the Great Elixir in the *Cantong Qi***\n**Diagram of the Gathered Celestial Fire Regimen**\n\nGather the celestial fire regimen to align with years, months, days, and hours, following yin and yang to withdraw and add water and fire, so the dragon’s essence gradually descends within the crucible, and the golden liquid flows smoothly within the womb.\n\n**Fire Regimen of the Celestial Cycle**\nThe mechanism most vital to the golden elixir:\nWithin the year, follow the moon’s changes;\nWithin the day, shift with the hours’ movement.\nThe four seasons share the same process,\nThe three spirits seem to possess knowledge.\nThe true secret of fire and metal—\nWhat else can be applied beyond this?\n\n**Fire Regimen of the Great Elixir in the *Cantong Qi***\n**Diagram of Metal and Fire Intermingling to Generate Medicine**",
      "overlap_context": "s, those with devious motives rush in, acting haughtily as if they were masters, remaining silent and secretive, treating the profound as something to be concealed, causing chaos and making the truth difficult to discern. They take peripheral and minor arts, falsely claiming them as the supreme Dao, and borrow the names of minerals, plants, and trees to pass off as true medicine—yet they achieve no effect. That later generations do not believe in the method of golden liquid is hardly surprising.",

      "translated_text": "**Daily Fire and Monthly Metal: The Convergence of Yin and Yang**\n\nSun’s fire and moon’s metal unite in the darkness of night,\nTheir essences intertwined to generate the myriad things.\nA month’s cycle concludes, then begins anew,\nSince the dawn of creation, endlessly revolving.\n\nWater and fire intermingle to nurture,\nSprouts blossom forth in fragrance.\nGolden radiance descends upon Mao’s stars,\nThe Jade Hare appears within the Heart Chamber.\nThe waning spirit begins with *xin*,\nThe soul retreats into the *gen* realm.\nThe Dao concludes in five and six,\nThe *Fu* hexagram unfolds once more.\n\n**Postscript to the *Annotated and Expanded Classic of the Dragon and Tiger***\nComposed by the Perfected One, Peng Xiao\n\nThe *Golden Key* states: When I first divided and analyzed the chapters and meanings of the *Cantong Qi*, I chanced upon an old text and perused the *Songs of the Perfected One of Mount Tai Bai*. Thereupon, I resolved to compose two essays—*Black Lead, the Water Tiger* and *Red Lead, the Fire Dragon*—the essence of which declares:\n\nBlack lead, the water tiger, is the root of heaven and earth’s generation, possessing both form and qi. Red lead, the fire dragon, is the origin of heaven and earth’s generation, possessing qi yet devoid of form. These two principles are immutable truths for all eternity.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Dao, that which has form is not the nine-and-one arts of the yin path—five metals, eight stones, saltpeter, frost, dew, or nectar. That which is formless is not the methods of the six desires, seven emotions, sitting in oblivion, or the visualization of the Three Ones. Thus, the ancients said: That which has form is true lead, the essence of the Grand Yin moon, the mother that nurtures the forms of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. That which is formless is true mercury, the light of the Grand Yang sun, the father that generates heaven, earth, and the myriad things. These two bodies, lead and mercury, mutually engender and cycle without end, truly the ancestors that give birth to heaven, earth, and all things.\n\nTherefore, perfected ones and superior scholars spare no effort in gathering the essence of the Grand Yin, devising symbolic methods to guide the qi of the Grand Yang into the divine chamber, where it coalesces into the divine elixir of golden liquid. The essence of the Grand Yin is the golden blossom, the yellow sprout. The qi of the Grand Yang is the flowing pearl, the enchanting maiden. Thus, the scripture states: *\"The flowing pearl of the Grand Yang ever seeks to depart; only when it encounters the golden blossom does it turn and remain.\"* It also says: *\"The enchanting maiden by the river is numinous and most divine. To restrain her, the yellow sprout must serve as her root.\"* The flowing pearl and enchanting maiden are of restless nature, prone to flight. Without the crucible’s vessel and the skillful summoning of methods, how could they idly abide upon杂物?\n\nThus, in crafting the great elixir, one must first refine true lead, modeling the divine chamber after heaven and earth. The upper crucible symbolizes heaven, the male, *qian*, *li*, the sun, fire, yang, and wood. The lower crucible symbolizes earth, the female, *kun*, *kan*, the moon, water, yin, and metal. When the two crucibles unite, they resemble an egg, their hollow interior spanning slightly over an inch to house the numinous mercury. Here, *kun* is the mother, the metal wife; *qian* is the father, the wood husband. Once the fire dragon unites beneath the divine chamber, the metal tiger’s essence converges within, their coupling unceasing, their progeny boundless. From wood arises the hun-soul, from metal the po-spirit. Hun and po congeal into qi, gradually forming the *yine* and *e*, their intermingling producing the flowing pearl, called the golden liquid. Thus, the ancient song says:\n\n*\"Bind the body, gather the po to sate the tiger’s hunger;\nThe tiger comes to feed, consuming marrow and fat.\"*\nMarrow and fat are the golden liquid.\n\nOne must also seek a numinous mountain or blessed land to construct the elixir chamber, erect a stellar altar, install the furnace and hearth, and cast the crucible chamber. Only when true companions gather and all guidelines are meticulously observed can one proceed with this endeavor. Thus, Master Zhen Yi, in his postscript to the *Cantong Qi*, states: *\"The adept must thoroughly relinquish fame and profit, sever worldly ties, retreat to a numinous mountain, and secretly cultivate with like-minded immortals, diligently practicing day and night. Only then may success be hoped for. Otherwise, one’s efforts will be in vain.\"*\n\nMaster Yin Zhen said: *\"Without the proper ground, do not act rashly. One must be discreet, cautious, and guarded, preserving the celestial mechanism. This medicine’s transformations are beyond comprehension.\"* He also said: *\"Do not waver in success or failure; with single-minded devotion, refine the returning elixir. Can this be empty words to delude later generations?\"*\n\nI, Dao, have encountered a teacher and followed his guidance for many years. Yet, burdened by a minor official post, a humble home, meager salary, and the entanglements of worldly affairs—compounded by a growing household—I have drifted to this point without the means to proceed. Nevertheless, my resolve has not faltered; my heart grows ever firmer. I await only a favorable wind to ultimately accomplish this task.\n\nThe nineteen fire-regimen diagrams are all included at the end of the lower volume of the *Cantong Qi*; they are not reproduced here. Only the *Diagram of the Gathered Celestial Fire Regimen* and the *Diagram of Metal and Fire Intermingling to Generate Medicine* are appended to this text, clarifying the dragon and tiger’s movements and verifying the mysterious workings of metal and wood.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the third month in the *yisi* year, I, Dao, was mistakenly summoned by the reigning emperor to discuss the arts of nurturing life and cultivating nature. I respectfully presented my annotations on the *Classic of the Dragon and Tiger* and my supplementary explanations of the *Cantong Qi*, offering my responses. I was graced with the emperor’s jade-like instructions, discoursing on lofty principles at length, fortunately without error or oversight. This was a thousand lifetimes’ blessing from a past existence. In the fourth month of that same year, I was entrusted with an official post in the Imperial Pharmacy, basking in the favor of imperial light. Having completed the transcription and presentation of my annotations on the *Classic of the Dragon and Tiger*, I, a distant and lowly figure, dared not presume to annotate and expand such texts—my transgression is unforgivable. Yet, thanks to the sagely sovereign’s forbearance, I was not immediately dismissed. Upon reviewing my errors, the emperor deemed me worthy of life beyond death.\n\nIn my supplementary annotations to the *Cantong Qi*, the explanations are somewhat extensive, and I was unable to present them simultaneously. Constrained by my meager salary and lack of resources, I could not transcribe them to reach the imperial gaze. My reverent heart yearns for the throne, yet I have no means to ascend. Later, I made several revisions and additions. I have now carefully transcribed them separately and commissioned their carving into woodblocks, hoping they may circulate among like-minded practitioners. If encountered, they may serve as a preliminary guide.\n\nSome may say: *\"The original text of the *Classic of the Dragon and Tiger* is profound and abstruse; it cannot be lightly discussed. Your annotations, sir, are crude and shallow—how can they be accurate?\"* To this, I reply: Since my youth, I have devoted myself to studying texts without respite. Now, at fifty-six, I have encountered a luminous teacher and oral instructions, which I have not failed to refine diligently. If I were to deceive later generations with falsehoods, how could I dare to betray the radiant heavens above?",
