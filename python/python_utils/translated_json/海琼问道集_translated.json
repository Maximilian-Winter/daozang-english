  "full_translation": "**The *Haiqiong Inquiries on the Dao* Collection**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Haiqiong Inquiries on the Dao* Collection. One fascicle, composed by Bai Yuchan in a state of mystical absorption, compiled by Liu Yuanchang. Originating from the Southern Song dynasty.\n**Source of Base Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Haiqiong Inquiries on the Dao* Collection**\n\nUpon reading Han Changli’s verses on Peach Blossom Spring, one’s thoughts drift to the ethereal realm of immortals; upon reading Bai Juyi’s odes to sea and mountain, one’s heart stirs with longing to return to Tuṣita. The human mind, rootless, generates wisdom in response to words.\n\nAlas! I have heard that immortality can be learned, that deathlessness can be attained through effort. Not that I claim mastery—only that I aspire to study it! From youth, my heart has been lashed by the pursuit of Daoist cultivation, and unawares, the years have passed from *renzi* to *dingchou*. How fleeting are the years of this world! How can this sack of skin and bone endure such weariness?\n\nHeaven, in its grace, has granted me gradual access to the Dao. In that spring, I encountered the true master, Lord Haiqiong—Bai, styled Yuchan—who some say was from Hainan, though others suspect his family hailed from Xiang or Mian. At times, his hair wild and feet bare, he plunged into the bustling marketplace; at others, clad in a green headscarf and rustic robes, he wandered through palaces and temples. Adrift among the common folk, none recognized him.\n\nHe claimed to be twenty-one, yet had delved into the Three Teachings’ texts without exception. In conversation, his command of classics and history flowed like a spring—surpassing even the most learned scholars of our age. His calligraphy—seal, clerical, cursive, and standard—revealed a mind of wondrous clarity. The qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting were but occasional diversions. Those who associated with him were all the era’s most eminent scholars, yet even his admirers found it difficult to draw near.\n\nThough he carried no paper, his brush filled the land; though he traversed rivers and lakes, his name resounded across the realm—so numerous were his followers. Often, his pouch held not a single copper coin or grain of millet for sustenance. At times, drunk beyond measure, he would summon thunder; in deep sleep, he could dispatch memorials to the heavens. Joy or anger, laughter or tears—his demeanor seemed unhinged, yet his words sometimes aligned with fortune or misfortune. His zeal for aiding the world and benefiting others was unceasing.\n\nHe would sit through the night by candlelight, or sing all day with hands clapping the railing. Neither morning baths nor daytime meals concerned him; for years, he treated fire and water as if they did not exist. Some marveled at his ears and eyes, while others heard him discourse in riddles with his teeth—though the meaning remained obscure. Sober without wine, dazed upon waking, his writings and sayings have been carved on steles and published by scholars across the land.\n\nNow, his wrath outweighs his caution, and he stands at odds with the world—yet those who revere him are drawn as if by magnet and needle! He entrusted me with texts on the Nine Cauldrons, golden lead, cinnabar, and mercury; with the secrets of the Great Monad’s elixir knife, fire talismans, and golden liquor; with the *Purple Empyrean*’s writings on summoning wind and thunder. I, Yuanchang, reflect that in the past, I offended Heaven, lost my true self, and fell into this world—how could I deserve such teachings? I vow to devote my body to their cultivation, that I may not betray what I have learned.\n\nThus, I have gathered a few of his enlightening exchanges and had them carved into wood, that fellow seekers across the Four Seas may find inspiration. Lord Bai received these teachings from Chen Niuwan; Chen from Xue Daoguang; Xue from Shi Tai; Shi from Zhang Pingshu; Zhang from Liu Haichan; and Liu from Lü Dongbin.\n\nSince all know his character, what need have I to elaborate further? With this, I bow twice in reverence.\n\n**Ziyuanzi Liu Yuanchang**\n\n---\n\n**The *Haiqiong Inquiries on the Dao* Collection**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Haiqiong Inquiries on the Dao* Collection. One fascicle, composed by Bai Yuchan in a state of mystical absorption, compiled by Liu Yuanchang. Originating from the Southern Song dynasty.\n**Source of Base Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n**The *Haiqiong Inquiries on the Dao* Collection**\n*Composed by Bai Yuchan of Haiqiong*\n\n**The Dragon-Tiger Rhapsody**\n\nMarvelous indeed! The ninefold-transmuted golden liquor, the sevenfold-returned Great Elixir of Reversion—truly the *tārā* of spirit and qi, the primal father of nature and life. It grasps the primordial of Anavatapta, fulfilling the illustrious merit of Dharma. The body is cinnabar, the heart mercury—emerging with the sun, entering with the moon. The Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird—Mars abides in *gui*, bathing in the vast; the sovereign of the *bing* Crimson Palace presides over the profound vessel of the Yellow Court. Compassionate yet solemn, majestic yet refined.\n\nHeaven’s One is *Kan*, Earth’s Two is *Li*—*Qian* and *Kun* alternate between south and north. True lead, the qi of prior heaven, crowns the seventy-two minerals. Hard and soft, inner and outer, the principles of the feminine and masculine—metal and fire embrace, gold and water engage. At *Chujiu*, before the divine transformation, the heart of heaven cradles harmonious yang. Wood-mercury engenders the body of the eastern dawn; metal-essence matures the embryo of the western *xu*. *Xun* completes its return, *Qian* its decline—spring and autumn manifest benevolence and righteousness; winter and summer, their boundaries and measures.\n\nThe cauldrons of *Danlou*, above and below—cinnabar and mercury unite, moved within the divine chamber. *Xu* and *Wei* spread their wings—metal does not split, earth does not scatter. Concealed leaps and hidden flights—coming and going, ascending and descending without fixed hexagram, returning to the Great Ultimate to enfold all minerals. Being and non-being, concealment and revelation—water and metal become the elixir, their root the sun’s essence, extinguishing *Kan* and *Li*. Floating and sinking, waxing and waning.\n\nThe Metal Elder seeks the fullness of *Kan*; the Crone knocks on the emptiness of *Li*. Metal slays wood, water treasures fire. The Yellow Emperor plants his banner in the Metal Village—metal, wood, and fire transform into the dust of the Bright Window. The primordial chaos of metal and fire—precious essence culminates in the ninefold. One *jin* of sixteen *liang*, three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. The *Zhen* hexagram receives the yang tally—water is dark, metal ochre, earth yellow. Mountains and rivers, the great earth congeal the void—essence and fluid merge with cinnabar to fuse the true.\n\nBlack lead transmutes into pure vermilion; mercury gleams with azure radiance. The golden flower veils the vast emptiness. Water as one, fire as two, earth as five—soaking the flourishing metal, flying the essence of water. The supreme essence of heaven and earth—with *wu* and *ji* revolving the celestial tally, the twelve Dipper pivots and twelve bell pitches—flowing mercury, the sun’s soul; golden moon, the moon’s spirit. The dark diagram not yet worn away—yang essence is the father of the *Bifang*; *Kun* transforms into *Zhen* at the first, then into *Dui* at the second. Sun and moon conjoin as jade disks, the upper crescent level as a cord.\n\nThe three fives and three yangs complete their circle—round brilliance appears in the eastern *jia*. The toad gazes at the hexagram’s nodes; the hare’s spirit emits living light. *Qian* first transforms into *Xun*, then into *Gen*—the moon shines in *xin*, revealing *bing*. Five and six cycles revolve—northeast loses its companion in the *yi* land. Earth and wood, metal harmonize into liquid, returning to the semblance of *Chan*. The divine chamber of the thunderous dawn—within, the five agents; without, the eight trigrams. Yin tally and yang fire—six decades transmute the hen’s egg; the Five Peaks stand in concealment. The pivot’s crown is *Qian*-metal; its heel, *Kun*-water. Yin and yang receive from nature—central harmony flows in purity. The numinous gate is black; lead refines true earth. The spring cavern births white metal—quicksilver.\n\nAt *hai*-end, yang stirs—the sun’s chariot traverses the southern lands. The five stars align in a pearl-string; metal and cinnabar breathe in unison. The slowness and swiftness of sun and moon—the Purple Tenuity’s sixteen stars of the Canopy, the Three Terraces’ harmonizing stars—demand governance and record. The sun’s fire unites the essence of the five agents, refining the earth of the central palace. The moon’s metal receives the discipline of the six pitches, entering the water of the northern quarter.\n\nFire is the elixir’s parents; the elixir, fire’s descendants. Water, earth, and metal—sixty days determine prior and subsequent life and death. Metal and mercury lock horns; the crucible and chamber stand in balance. The earth-mother summons the harmony of the four directions—*Qian* stirs, responding to the Three Luminaries. The essence and qi of metal and fire illuminate the chamber—how could water dry up and fire perish? The qi of dragon and tiger intertwine; the affections of metal and wood unite. Emotion and nature intertwine—warmly nurturing the child-pearl.\n\nWater is the dark flower; earth, the metal-mother. The elixir chamber congeals flowing pearls—yellow and black blend the primordial essence of water and earth. Purple blossoms spread their richness; yellow liquid ripples. The divine medicine not yet mature—metal generates water. Refining lead into white metal, white metal into the divine chamber. The divine chamber holds metal-water—the fire’s hue transforms, congealing into yellow ascent. Water and fire coagulate in the central palace—golden liquor does not fly. Fire scorches the golden flower—light smoke, thin mist, then silence.\n\nWhite metal is being; fire’s qi, non-being. Refining mercury heralds the divine, the twofold emptiness. Water and fire embrace purity; sun and moon hold the void. Black lead—metal’s essence, dark water—envelops *Kan*-mercury. The yellow sprout appears; the white medicine, the red bud of metal—water’s mother, the Flowery Pond overflows with the true. The plain altar, the furnace’s tortoise, holds the divine chamber—its winding paths and barrier dikes. Metal and earth unite with mercury—naturally, the divine transformation is complete!\n\n---\n\n**The Song of the Crow and Hare**\n\nAh! The wonder of the golden liquor’s Great Elixir of Reversion—its subtlety pervades the cosmos, sinking into the bones of the void. At dawn’s glow, the Dipper ascends to the left; at dusk’s dust, it turns to the right. In the sun’s palace, the hare leaps; in the moon’s mansion, the crow soars. The Alchemical Maiden rides the red dragon; the Metal Elder crouches on the black tiger. Cinnabar gestates mercury; lead seals silver. The four images reach their limit; the five agents govern through earth. The Yellow Matron dons a rainbow skirt; *ding* faces forward, clad in azure mist. Black and white divide the Mysterious Female; the Flowery Pond emits jade nectar. The Red Child gives birth to the dark pearl; the red furnace smelts hard metal.\n\nThe green turtle’s feet are red; the white toad’s back is black. Jade creepers flourish in the divine valley; golden millet sprouts in the cinnabar field. The *pāṭala* flower blooms; the *devas’* clouds scatter their leaves. The southern *Ji* and *Yaoyao*; the northern *Shao* and the dark record of *Li*. The celestial scheme—sun and moon repeat; Mars establishes the six voids. The wind-wheel and water-fire *Gou*—the vast womb, the three-line embryo. Two and three, nursing complete; five and six, ninety-nine cycles. Locusts fly in summer snow; grass thrives in winter’s heat.\n\nThe Yang’s vigor fortifies the martial city-pool;\nThe Yin’s softness cherishes the literary pearl’s treasure.\nHare and fowl bathe in orchid and angelica.\n\nThe toad’s radiance transforms into halberds and spears;\nThe recumbent moon’s furnace forges the celestial stem.\nThe cinnabar tripod stands atop Kunlun;\n*Qian*’s origin, *Qian*’s *Zhun* and *Meng*;\n*Kun*’s function, *Kun*’s *Pi* and *Tai*.\n\nChang’e pairs with Rāhu;\nYang Li weds the lunar comet.\nClear and turbid are discerned in mud;\nFloating and sinking are sought in fire.\nHost and guest mutually punish and empower;\nGeneration and conquest reciprocate grace and harm.\n\nTwo eights form double bowstrings;\nTwo sevens and nine compose *Qian*.\nThe killing mechanism kills in *Gen*;\nDrilling and refining belong to *Zhen*.\n\nThe Great One gestates *Wu* and *Ji*;\nAll things are but wind and moon.\nIron, tin, copper, *tou*, silver—\nTransform to birth the purple lotus leaves.\n\nOne asks of the lotus leaves:\nA numinous fragrance suffuses the smoke-laden thoroughfare.\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthy as frost;\nThe Most High Lord Lao as cherry blossoms.\n\nAlas!\nThe *Mysterious Pass* reveals its esoteric discourse:\nA single word, half a phrase—thus the profound is penetrated.\nWhy need a thousand, ten thousand scrolls of alchemical texts?\nIf one is not burdened by form,\nBefore one’s eyes lies the Great Heavenly Net.\n\nShould one wish to refine form and spirit,\nOne must recognize returning to the root and restoring life.\nThus the Dao returns to the root through the root’s aperture;\nRestoring life seeks the life-restoring pass.\nAs for this pass and aperture—\nIf one knows their true reality,\nThen returning to the root and restoring life pose no difficulty.\n\nHence it is said:\nShould one wish to know the immortal’s art,\nOne must but search for the root of creation.\nOf old, Emptiness gave birth to the Spontaneous;\nThe Spontaneous gave birth to the Great Dao;\nThe Great Dao gave birth to the One Qi;\nThe One Qi divided into Yin and Yang;\nYin and Yang became Heaven and Earth;\nHeaven and Earth gave birth to the myriad things—\nThis is the root of creation.\n\nThis is the True One’s Qi,\nAntecedent to all phenomena,\nThe Grand Void, the Grand Nonbeing,\nThe Grand Emptiness, the Grand Mystery.\nVast and obscure, immeasurable by inches;\nBoundless and surging, unfathomable by shores.\nIts greatness has no exterior;\nIts smallness has no interior.\nVast enough to embrace Heaven and Earth;\nMinute enough to enter the tip of a hair.\nAbove, no further hue;\nBelow, no further abyss.\nOne thing, round and luminous,\nManifesting through the ages—\nThat which cannot be named.\n\nThe sage, with heart, apprehends it;\nReluctantly, names it the Dao.\nThus to know that the heart itself is the Dao.\nTherefore, without heart, one merges with the Dao;\nWith heart, one strays from the Dao.\nOnly this word “without”:\nEncompasses all existence without remainder,\nGenerates the myriad things without exhaustion.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast,\nThey can command the formed,\nBut cannot command the formless.\nThough Yin and Yang are subtle,\nThey can command the qi-endowed,\nBut cannot command the qi-less.\nThough the Five Phases are most refined,\nThey can command the numbered,\nBut cannot command the numberless.\nThough a hundred thoughts arise in tumult,\nThey can command the conscious,\nBut cannot command the unconscious.\n\nNow, those who cultivate this principle—\nWould do well first to refine the form.\nThe marvel of refining form lies in congealing spirit.\nWhen spirit congeals, qi gathers;\nWhen qi gathers, the elixir forms;\nWhen the elixir forms, the body solidifies;\nWhen the body solidifies, spirit is complete.\n\nThus Song Qiqiu said:\nForget form to nurture qi;\nForget qi to nurture spirit;\nForget spirit to nurture emptiness.\nOnly this word “forget”—\nThis is the state of no-thing.\nOriginally, there was not one thing—\nWhere could dust alight?\nThis is what is meant.\n\nIf one can savor this principle,\nAnd labor upon this word “forget,”\nOne may enter the profound subtleties of the Great Dao,\nSeize the marvelous workings of spontaneity,\nEstablish the elixir’s foundation in an instant,\nAnd circulate creation within one’s body.\n\nYet this Dao—\nGazed upon, it is desolate and nothing is seen;\nListened to, it is obscure and nothing is heard.\nOnly with the heart can one see its images;\nOnly with the heart can one hear its sounds.\nIf the Daoist adept,\nWith darkened heart and congealed spirit,\nAttains emptiness and preserves stillness,\nThen the empty chamber generates brightness—\nTruly, this is spontaneity.\n\nOnly the Most High saves beings,\nTeaching people to cultivate and refine:\nTaking Heaven and Earth as the crucible,\nThe crow and hare as medicinal substances,\nThe sun’s essence’s ascent and descent corresponding to qi and blood’s rise and fall,\nThe moon’s spirit’s waxing and waning corresponding to essence and spirit’s ebb and flow,\nThe four seasons’ nodes corresponding to a day’s hours,\nThe celestial revolution’s stellar count corresponding to a furnace’s alchemy.\n\nThus:\nGather essence and spirit as medicine;\nTake stillness and quiescence as fire.\nWith the fire of stillness and quiescence,\nRefine the medicine of essence and spirit—\nThus is the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor formed.\nFor the union of true Yin and true Yang,\nThe pairing of one water and one fire,\nFirst discern floating and sinking,\nThen clarify host and guest,\nScrutinize the operations of withdrawal and addition,\nExamine the perils of reversal and repetition.\n\nAs Gao Xiangxian said:\n“Gather on the appointed day;\nTake at the proper time.”\nAs Liu Haichan said:\n“Opening and closing, Heaven and Earth’s creative power—\nForge and refine a furnace of true sun and moon.”\nThose who comprehend this\nEmulate the sun and moon’s workings,\nAnd share the same merit as Heaven and Earth.\n\nHow could one know:\nHeaven nurtures without image;\nEarth nurtures without form.\nThus Heaven is long, Earth enduring;\nSun radiant, moon luminous—\nThe True One eternally abides;\nEmptiness never perishes.\n\nNow, I model myself upon this:\nNo affairs for the heart;\nNo heart for affairs.\nInwardly observe the heart—\nThe heart has no heart.\nOutwardly observe the form—\nThe form has no form.\nObserve things afar—\nThings have no things.\nKnow the heart is heartless;\nKnow the form is formless;\nKnow things are thingless—\nTranscend the myriad illusions,\nSteadfastly, one numinous essence.\n\nThe ancient scripture says:\n“It gave birth to me in emptiness,\nPlaced me in nothingness.”\nThus one should return to the root of nature’s primordial beginning,\nRevert to the state before one’s birth.\nHide the heart within the heart, yet it is not seen;\nConceal spirit within spirit, yet it does not emerge.\nThus one can:\nRoundly penetrate the three times,\nStilling the myriad threads;\nPurify the six roots,\nEmptying the square inch to clarity.\nNot clinging to emptiness,\nNot clinging to nothingness—\nEmpty all that is empty;\nVoid all that is void.\nUntil emptiness is empty of emptiness,\nVoid is void of void—\nPure, bare, naked, and unadorned—\nThen the numinous alone abides.\n\nThe Dao does not desire emptiness;\nEmptiness naturally returns to it.\nIf one can empty the heart,\nThe Dao naturally returns to one.\n\nThe Dao is originally nameless,\nNear yet cannot be grasped,\nFar yet cannot be abandoned,\nNeither square nor round,\nNeither within nor without—\nOnly the sage knows it.\n\nThe three poisons have no root,\nThe six desires have no seed;\nSudden awakening to this principle unites all in emptiness and nothingness.\nLaozi said: “Between heaven and earth,\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nThe more it moves, the more it yields.”\n\nIf one can, in the midst of stillness and concentration,\nEmbrace the qi of harmonious balance,\nGuard the essence of the True One,\nThis is sealing the furnace and securing the elixir,\nProceeding with the fire phases.\n\nFire originates from the southern *Li* trigram,\n*Li* belongs to the heart,\nThe heart is spirit,\nSpirit is fire,\nQi is the medicine.\nRefining the medicine with fire to form the elixir\nIs precisely guiding qi with spirit to accomplish the Dao.\n\nIf one can grasp the sun and moon in hand,\nHold the primordial chaos in the heart,\nOne naturally witnesses the opening of the bellows,\nThe ascent and descent of the river chariot,\nWater irrigating the palace of life,\nFire nourishing the terrace of the elixir,\nMetal and wood merging,\nWater and earth harmonizing.\nThe maiden rides the dragon,\nThe old man straddles the tiger,\nReversing through the three barriers,\nAscending to the inner court,\nTransforming into liquid jade,\nDescending into the tower of nine stories.\nWithin lies a cavity called the Elixir Terrace,\nWhere lead and mercury unite,\nWater and fire merge.\nAs soon as the intent arrives,\nIt is like a seal matching its impression—\nNatural, unforced, and perfectly aligned.\n\nThe movement of movement arises from non-movement,\nThe action of action arises from non-action.\nAt this moment,\nWhite snow blankets the sky,\nYellow sprouts cover the earth,\nDragon roars and tiger howls,\nHusband sings and wife follows,\nThe jade crucible boils,\nThe golden furnace blazes,\nThunder rumbles and lightning flashes,\nShaking heaven and earth.\nThe hundred meridians bristle,\nThe three barriers open,\nThe mysterious pearl takes form,\nThe Great One returns to truth.\nWind stirs in the mud-pill palace,\nThe moon shines in the crimson palace,\nMist warms the cinnabar field,\nWaves settle in the valley pond.\nRefining the returning elixir\nIs as easy as turning the hand.\n\nSeven reversals and nine returns\nComplete the great medicine.\nRefining by day and simmering by hour,\nUntil the pill revolves—\nHeaven’s gate and earth’s pivot\nLie within one’s grasp.\nThe scripture says:\n“If one can always remain pure and still,\nHeaven and earth all return to them.”\nThus the three flowers gather at the crown,\nThe five qi ascend to the origin,\nOne may enter the gate of manifold wonders,\nThe mystery within mystery.\n\nFurther, by day wielding the numinous banner,\nBy night nurturing the fiery mushroom,\nWarming and nourishing the sacred embryo,\nGiving birth to the crimson child—\nUntil the embryo is shed and the spirit transformed,\nYang is restored and the bones exchanged,\nThis is preserving the spirit with the jade tally,\nRefining the form with golden liquid,\nBoth form and spirit perfected,\nMerging with the Dao in truth.\n\nZhang Pingshu said:\n“All comes in a moment’s effort,\nEternally securing boundless ease.”\nTruly so!\n\nThis speaks of it.\n\nFor it is the foundation of the Dao, the root of the elixir,\nThe origin of dragon and tiger, the ancestor of lead and mercury.\nWhere the three fires gather, where the eight waters return,\nThe gate where myriad spirits pay homage,\nThe source of the golden elixir’s wondrous workings—\nThis is the crucial aperture of returning to the root and restoring life.\n\nOnce one knows this,\nDesires need not be banished, for the heart naturally stills;\nThe heart need not be settled, for the spirit naturally clears.\nWith not a single thought arising, all illusions subside.\nThe body rides the whirlwind, the spirit roams the vast expanse.\nOnly then does one realize:\nWhen the wind is pure and the moon bright, all reveals the mechanism of lead and mercury;\nWhen waters are green and mountains blue, all discloses the essence of tiger and dragon.\n\nBai Yuchan of Hainan, having learned the elixir method from his late master Chen Niyuan, would at the winter solstice when the sun reached its zenith,\nOpen Qian and close Xun, retain Kun and block Gen,\nGrasp the Dipper’s handle, tilt the celestial pivot,\nPay homage to the Xuanyuan Emperor, pass through Fusang,\nEnter the Broad Cold Palace, face the Quail’s Tail,\nRaise the Yellow Bell, stir the sea’s waves,\nAscend Kunlun, bear the Tang talisman,\nShake the thunder of heaven, wander Mount Wu,\nSummon the Yellow Lad, call the Vermilion Child,\nTake the liver of the Azure Dragon, the marrow of the White Tiger,\nThe blood of the Crimson Phoenix, the essence of the Black Tortoise,\nPlace them in the earthen crucible, kindle the Sparkling Deluder,\nCommand Guan Bo to transform them into cinnabar,\nOpen the Flowery Pond, draw in the spirit-water,\nDrink the knife-point’s measure,\nProceed from nonbeing into being, from formlessness into form,\nWithdraw lead and add mercury,\nKnit together the sacred embryo.\nAfter ten months, when qi is full and form complete,\nA body exists beyond the body—\nThis is called the Embryonic Immortal.\n\nIts secret says:\n“When intent is undivided, the spirit may be concentrated;\nWith the heart ashen and in profound stillness,\nThe golden elixir forms within.”\nThis is what the master attained.\n\nAs in the poem of Shi Jianwu of old:\n*\"Qi is the medicine that adds years,\nThe heart commands qi as its spirit.\nWho masters spirit and qi\nBecomes an immortal indeed.\"*\n\nThis verse is simple yet profoundly abstruse. Jade Toad, upon reading it, recited it naturally until the autumn moon shone bright in the sky, and the void dissolved into the realm of decay—only those who are withered wood and cold ash could not comprehend this.\n\nSince you have attained this, I dare not keep silent. The Supreme Mysterious Statutes say:\n*\"To meet someone and not transmit is to lose the Heavenly Dao;\nTo transmit to the unworthy is to leak the Heavenly Treasure.\"*\nAcross land and sea, I have sought in vain for one worthy—transmission must not be reckless, lest I incur Heaven’s censure. Yet fearing the Great Dao may go untransmitted and the elixir arts fade into oblivion, I compose *The Manifest Secret of the Mysterious Pass*, to enlighten this world and instruct later learners, preserving the slender thread of the golden elixir.\n\nStill, I worry that people remain ignorant of this principle, so I shall speak further: With the eye, see the eye; with the ear, hear the ear; with the nose, regulate the nose; with the mouth, seal the mouth. Concealment and soaring flight both arise from the one heart. First, cultivate stillness and concentrate the spirit, restrain anger and suppress desire. When anger is restrained and desire suppressed, water and fire achieve harmony; when water and fire harmonize, metal and wood unite; when metal and wood unite, the true earth returns to its place; when the true earth returns, the golden elixir naturally grows as large as a millet grain, adding one grain each day. Spirit returns, qi is restored, filling heaven and earth. As Mencius said of nurturing the vast and mighty qi—this is it.\n\nWhen liver-qi is whole, there is benevolence; when lung-qi is whole, there is righteousness; when heart-qi is whole, there is propriety; when kidney-qi is whole, there is wisdom; when spleen-qi is whole, there is trust. If one’s qi is deficient, one lacks benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—how can such a one be called human? Those who cultivate emptiness and nurture the vast, whose hearts are expansive and bodies at ease, find the qi-mother already formed, and the elixir easily coalesces. How can one not cherish this nurturance to preserve one’s boundless self? Let scholars ponder this.\n\nRespectfully inscribed and entrusted to Liu Ziyuan.\n\n**The Recluse of Hidden Mountain’s Writings**\nJade Toad withdrew from the world and reclined high upon Ge Mountain’s peak. A visitor asked: \"What is the essence of reclusion in the mountains? What joy does it bring?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Those who excel at mountain reclusion do not know the joy of reclusion; those who know its joy are like birds that must choose their trees or fish that must choose their waters. The joy of mountain dwellers lies not in the mountains themselves, but in the heart’s joy—when heart and mountain become one. Facing circumstances without attachment, facing the heart without circumstance—this is the true joy of reclusion!\"\n\nThe visitor asked: \"If the essence of mountain reclusion is thus, do mountain recluses not know the flavor of the mountains?\"\n\nHe replied: \"The flavor of the mountains is the joy of the mountains. The recluse knows the flavor of the Dao, not the flavor of the mountains. Let me tell you of what my ears have heard and eyes have seen.\"\n\nThe visitor assented.\n\nHe continued: \"The recluse must not let the joy of the mountains sway the heart, nor let the heart’s joy cling to the mountains. The mountain is the mountain, the heart is the heart. The recluse does not ask, 'What were people like in ancient times? What are they like now?'—this mountain is as it is, that mountain is as it is. There are those who reclude in mountains, times for reclusion, and joys of reclusion. In such times, sages and worthies gather; people esteem virtue and Dao; their joy lies in refining form and spirit. Yet I fear that with such knowledge and perception, nine or ten out of ten will fall short of the ancients!\n\nThe mountain recluse is not one who must dwell among peaks and ridges—without peaks and ridges, there are still mountains. Each person has their own mountain of reclusion. Those who are clear, empty, tranquil, lofty, and explore the profound—this is the mountain of the person, the mountain of the heart. Those entangled in right and wrong, honor and disgrace, poverty and wealth, high and low—this is the marketplace of the person, the marketplace of the heart. Today, some say great reclusion lies in secluded villages, while lesser reclusion lies in the mountains—this is not without reason.\n\nSince the habits of fame and profit burn fiercely, and worldly desires assail the mind, one grows weary of noise and seeks quiet. But when the joy of tranquility fills the heart and the impulse for cultivation cools, one grows weary of quiet and seeks noise. Yet if one can establish this heart, whether in a secluded garden or a bustling marketplace, it remains the same heart. There is no need to flee the heart’s noise to satisfy its desires, nor to delight in a superior environment or resent an inferior one. Knowing the mountain as it is, rejoicing in the heart as it is—this is true reclusion!\n\nTo reclude in mountains, first reclude the heart. Without affairs, govern the heart—this is reclusion; with affairs, respond to the near—this is the mountain. Without heart for the mountain, without mountain in the heart. Thus, one must first recognize the Dao before recluding in the mountains. If one dwells in the mountains before knowing the Dao, seeing the mountain, one forgets the Dao. If one knows the Dao before dwelling in the mountains, pursuing the Dao, one forgets the mountain. Forgetting the mountain, the Dao-nature gladdens the spirit; forgetting the Dao, the mountain’s form obscures the eyes. Thus, forgetting the mountain reveals the Dao—even the human world becomes still. Seeing the mountain and forgetting the Dao, even the mountains become noisy.\n\nWhen all dharmas are empty and merged, when every thought is empty and still—what city is too noisy? What mountain marsh is too quiet? If the mountain is quiet yet the heart is always noisy, it is no different from the marketplace. If the marketplace is noisy yet the heart is always quiet, it is no different from the mountain. Noisy yet not noisy—what quiet remains to seek? Speech and silence are but mountains; movement and stillness are but markets. Serenity rests within, undisturbed; freedom and ease manifest outwardly—like fish and kites soaring in the sky and abyss. One simply follows what brings joy!\"\n\nThe joy here is not the joy of the ears and eyes, nor the joy that follows; it is not the joy of emotions and perceptions, nor the joy that follows. Joy resides in the heart—it cannot be described in form, nor grasped by knowledge or sight.\n\nThe joy of the heart is the joy of the recluse, untouched by mountains. The pure and still is one’s Dao-ground; serenity and retreat are one’s practice; peace and bliss are one’s kin. One desires no commerce with the world, no entanglement with things. In cultivating the body, one does not serve the hundred limbs; in nourishing form, one does not indulge in the five flavors. One regards the day of death as no different from the year of life, and treats possessions as though they were nothing.\n\nIn quiet meditation, clouds drift through valleys and mist swirls among peaks; in walking meditation, moonlight fills the grottoes and wind stirs the forests. Deer and elk are one’s companions; pines and bamboo are one’s neighbors. One enjoys the wealth of spring leeks and autumn chrysanthemums, the nobility of morning mist and evening dew.\n\nAs for clothing—plaited grass and knotted rushes, woven reeds and sewn orchids. As for food—steamed ginseng and mashed poria, pine-nut rice and cypress-leaf gruel. One drinks from the crystalline springs of stone marrow, feeds on the rich earth of mountain liver. One walks before withered trees, sits beneath ancient cliffs, dwells in deep forests and secluded valleys, sleeps upon mossy stones.\n\nBy day, one chants long to the secluded clouds and springs; by night, one sleeps alone in the depths of mist and haze. In heat and cold, the heart is warmed by the Dao and knows not summer’s heat; the heart is chilled by the Dao and knows not winter’s cold. Knowing winter’s cold, frost and ice crisp the skin yet do not alter the bearing of pines and cedars; wind and snow freeze the body yet do not change the integrity of mountains and stones. Knowing summer’s heat, scorching sun drenches one in sweat yet does not stir a mind of vexation; blazing fire burns without yet does not move within.\n\nRoaming freely through valleys and hills, wandering boundlessly across open fields, the body moves with ease, the heart rests in stillness. I fear that beneath the city’s roofs, the clamor of voices and colors, the entanglements of dust and toil—five hues may blind the eyes, five tones deafen the ears, five desires muddy the heart. Once they enter the heart, if the heart does not admit them, they shake it by day and overturn it by night. With no anchor in the heart, one is swept away by affairs, ensnared by things.\n\nYet even in the mountains and wilds, is it truly different? Wildflowers and grasses may dazzle the eyes; rare birds and bright finches may captivate the ears. If one does not conceal the heart and seeks only to hide in the mountains—can this be called reclusion?\n\nThe intent of the ancient sages in retiring to the mountains was indeed thus; but the act of retiring to the mountains was not. The world rushes toward profit, customs drown in desire, sunk in the intoxication of fame and gain, dreaming in the realm of self and others—born and dying without awareness, trading sin for blessing without notice. This is what the sage grieves over, and so the sage retreats.\n\nThe sage’s grief is not grief of the heart, but grief for others; the sage’s retreat is not retreat to the mountains, but retreat of the heart. Thus, the body is but straw dogs to the form of the sentient, while gold and jade are to the nature of the sentient. It is not the form that is refined beyond the mountains, but the nature that is perfected within them. Only the sage understands this.\n\nDo you wish to hear of the flavors of the mountains, the essence of the mountains? The mountain as mountain, the person as person—one need not necessarily hide in the mountains to retreat, nor must the mountains depend on people to exist. To dwell in the mountains, to walk in reclusion, without stirring thoughts of vexation—straw huts and bamboo cottages, grass mats and pine-wood stoves cannot make one cold; dense forests and tall bamboo, cool winds and chilled springs cannot make one hot. One laughs and wanders amidst mist and clouds, reclines and rises with wind and rain, finding joy where others cannot, attaining what others cannot attain.\n\nThere are leaves for writing, flowers for twilight. One’s zither plays the wind through the pines; one’s wine drips like rain upon stone. In stillness, the heart finds Chan; in practice, the heart is refined. One sees tigers and wolves as household swine, calls bears and rhinos as one’s servants. Solitary as the cold ape’s night cry, at ease as the white cloud’s evening flight—neither court nor world can constrain the heart, neither life nor fate can trap the will.\n\nThis is called cultivating reclusion; this is called the mountain of reclusion. Such a mountain is not the mountain of the world; such a person is not the person of the world. Person and mountain transform together, mountain and person forget each other. The person is the heart; the mountain is the heart. This heart knows not which is mountain, which is person.\n\nIt can be known yet not known by knowing; it can be seen yet not seen by seeing. The wondrous subtlety of pure truth and tranquil emptiness is neither mountain nor person. This marvel of neither mountain nor person—like the moon in the waves, like the wind in the bamboo—cannot be spoken of and obtained.\n\nA guest said: I wish to follow these words and travel with you, Master.\nThe Master asked: Who are you?\nThe guest replied: I am Ziyuanzi.\n\n*Record of the Realm of Constant Radiance*\nJade Toad Elder laughs amidst the wind and moon of the clear and empty capital, abiding in the desolate and secluded realm of streams and mountains. Morning feasts on rosy clouds, evening feeds on purple mist—his four great elements are at ease, his one nature is joyful. He knows not whether spring and autumn seek to chill or warm him, nor whether sun and moon seek to yin or yang him. Half-drunk, half-dreaming, half-wandering, half-stumbling.\n\nThe sky, unobstructed by healing clouds, dawn’s radiance dazzles the eyes. Suddenly, the wind through bamboo groves turns cold, dark clouds veil the light, a fine rain clears the dust—mountains darken, waters fade, birds take flight, fish hide. Soon, the gloom lifts, the weather pleases, warm as spring, crisp as autumn. Colorful clouds soar in the southern azure; within them stands a figure—wearing the cap of carefree spontaneity, the shoes of ultimate reality, the robes of emptiness and profound stillness, feasting on the food of Chan joy and Dharma bliss.\n\nThe ten eyes cannot perceive his form, the four ears cannot hear his voice. Mount Sumeru and Mount Lu cannot surpass his height, the ocean of Sarvajñā cannot encompass his intent. His steps follow flowing clouds and waters; his speech and silence are like emerald bamboo and golden blossoms.\n\nPresently, he spoke: *\"I am the Positionless True One—do you know me?\"* The World-Honored One shares a womb with ants, Tuṣita and the Iron Enclosure dwell in the same realm. You may dismiss the ministers who govern hearing, discharge the officials who oversee sight, and wander with only your shadow in the land beyond yin and yang.\n\nThe old man assented. His heart became clods of earth, his form a withered tree—thus he met the True One. It seemed as though they had once met by chance, yet their bond felt as if they had never before exchanged words. The True One and the old man, staffed with the staff of no-thought, unfurled the canopy of great function manifest—walking and resting, they wandered beyond the measure of day and night, traversing some one hundred eight thousand *li*. They first crossed the mountain of the five aggregates, sailed the sea of the six desires, departed the land of ignorance, and emerged from the realm of greed and craving.\n\nSuddenly, in a certain region, the True One said: *\"This is the Land of Constant Radiant Light of Great Wisdom, the Precept Province of Dhyāna County, the Village of Nothing-Whatsoever, the Hamlet of Nirvāṇa.\"* The True One was the sovereign of this land. His dwelling was the Palace of the Empty Heart, the Tower of Liberation, the Pavilion of Suchness, the Terrace of Quiescence, the Palace of Perfect Enlightenment, the Hall of True Insight. In this land, the earth bore no dust or mud, the sky knew no darkness or brightness. Here, ruler and subject, father and child, sage and commoner, all sentient beings shared the same form and appearance, without surname or name. Its adornments were beyond description, its enjoyments beyond measure.\n\nThe True One rode the chariot of the five wisdoms, mounted the seven-jeweled carriage, opened the treasury of light contending with emptiness, and planted the banner of spiritual power and sovereignty. Together with the old man, he roamed beneath the Peak of Knowledge and Vision, where lay the Mysterious Cavern, the River of Compassionate Endurance, and the Forest of Merit. After a long while, they traversed the Garden of Bodhi, the Garden of No-Form, the Eightfold Returning Parks, the Fourfold Enclosure and Ponds, strolled through the Grove of Samādhi, and climbed the Mountain of the Four Truths.\n\nWhen the True One wished to return, he boarded the Prajñā boat, crossed the Sea of Equality, and in less than the time it takes to snap a finger, completed the journey there and back. The Boundless True One bowed to the old man and sat in repose within the Pavilion of Pure Contention. He opened the sixfold doors and windows of supernatural powers, adorned the courtyard of myriad transformations, burned the incense of the five divisions, offered the six flavors of hunger, presented the tea of eightfold sovereignty, poured the water of the eight merits, displayed the pearl of the five eyes, revealed the seal of the one truth, set forth the torch of cessation and abiding, and lit the lamp of seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving.\n\nSuddenly, the True One vanished. The old man turned his head—his whereabouts were lost. Startled, he awakened, yet felt a sudden loss. He declared to the gods and men: *\"That True One resembled my form, mirrored my will. Am I not awake? Am I not sober? Shall I forsake what is real and cling to what is illusory?\"* Then, with a long sigh, he exclaimed: *\"I am the True One, the True One is I. I shall depart!\"*\n\nHe summoned Master Writ of the Walled City, Envoy Ink of the Pine, and commanded Clay Pot, White Qi, and others to record it, while Purple Prime wrote it down.\n\n---\n\n**Rhapsody on the Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid**\n\nThose who study the Dao must cultivate the golden elixir. When the body’s wood withers and the heart’s embers grow cold, to ascend to the jade towers, one must refine the golden elixir. The Qian horse and Kun ox guard Lord Ding within the sacred chamber; the Kan crow and Li hare unite the maiden with the true altar. The Scarlet Tower’s scattered officials and the Pure Court’s idle scholars command the Azure Dragon of Fusang to spread its wings and emerge from fire, while the White Tiger of Mount Hua bares its fangs and enters water.\n\nThe celestial furnace and earthen crucible are the pivot of the three passes’ transformations; the moon’s essence and sun’s spirit are a handful of yin and yang’s marrow.\n\nThe lead conceals earth within, while mercury yields gold at its core; the tortoise embodies the *zi* trigram, the serpent the *wu* image. The hare is the creature of *mao*, the rooster the fowl of *you*. The Four Symbols and Five Phases never depart from *wu*; the Three Primes and Eight Trigrams rely upon *ren*.\n\nAt dawn, it is *tun*; at dusk, it is *meng*. The six lines bear form—by night, it must return; by day, it must meet. All things, devoid of intent, thus converge the Three Essences within the Primordial Palace. The two qi ascend and descend, spiraling along the Yellow Way.\n\nOnly a single taste of mercury, once transformed, becomes black jade; thus, sevenfold refined cinnabar becomes a crimson jewel. Citron and pomegranate, fire-pear and jujube—universal white snow flutters in the pure breeze of the Purple Court, while golden blossoms fill the courtyard, veiling the auspicious herbs of the Elixir Field.\n\nI know well what is drawn forth and what is added, where it is gathered, and where life and death reside. Waxing and waning follow their time; floating and sinking are the root of clarity and turbidity, while separation and union, motion and stillness, form their foundation. Nurture the upright to embrace the One; hold fullness and guard the feminine. None in the world can fathom this—all day they sit in stupor, knowing not where to turn.\n\nBlessing gives rise to harm, harm to blessing; the Chamber star meets the Pleiades. The host within the guest, the guest within the host—the Dipper’s measure revolves past the Winnowing Basket. Truly, the Great Dao speaks not, and the inner elixir is no mere technique. The Mystic Pearl hangs in its image, yin enfolding yang’s virtue; the infant forms its embryo, the masculine containing the feminine essence.\n\nBetween sovereign and minister, there is first and last, regret and shame; beyond husband and wife, there is survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune. The heart resides in *ding*’s position, the bow in *gui*’s; the maiden dwells in *jia*’s palace, the Net in *geng*’s. Though punishment and virtue wax and wane, with prosperity and adversity, bathing and concealment hold no fixed certainty—only the weight of medicinal ingredients.\n\nEast, west, south, and north converge at the center; the fire-timing of city and moat unites the two, eight, nine, and three. Thus, the Dark Crow’s river chariot ascends for a hundred moments, while the Flowery Pond’s divine water flows backward through the four seasons. Constructive and defensive qi shift with the Quail Fire and Ghost Well; spirit and essence wane and wax with the Dark Void and Dipper-Ox. Mother and child swiftly cover one another; body transforms, heart transforms. Brothers fill the flute, fortune refines, wisdom refines.\n\nThe six moving lines reveal the changes of new moon, full moon, and crescent; the two solstices alter their course, bringing fears of locusts, floods, and drought. The Perfected One roams the cosmos, mastering the subtle and vast; mountains return to his grasp. Left army, right army—since ancient times, benevolence and righteousness endure. Great reclusion, small reclusion—now the palace and horn winds whisper softly, the moon shines bright. A solitary cloud, a lone crane—then a long, resonant cry. These writings are left for later students.\n\n**Poem on the Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid**\nCrow and hare in the Qian-Kun crucible,\nTortoise and serpent on the *fu* and *gou* altar.\nThe world’s idle wanderers—\nWithin their hearts, the Great Return Elixir.\n\nThe White Tiger roars in water,\nThe Azure Dragon coils in fire.\nMercury and lead, muddy medicines gleam;\nMetal and wood, snowflakes turn cold.\n\n*Li* and *Kan* are not heart and kidney,\nEast and west not lung and liver.\nThree phrases exhaust the seven returns,\nNine revolutions bring forth the Mud Pill.\n\n**Song of the Dao’s Mystic Pivot**\nHave you not seen—\nA single grain of golden elixir, how resplendently red,\nLarge as a pellet, bright as a tangerine?\nEach person’s share is originally perfect,\nNightly, its numinous light fills the Spirit Chamber.\n\nThe Spirit Chamber is this numinous terrace,\nWithin it, the embryo of endless life.\nThe Primordial Lord calls it the Crescent Moon Furnace,\nWithin the furnace, the medicine mirrors the Three Terraces.\n\nAt first, one father faces one mother;\nAfterward, three sons and three daughters.\nAt dawn, *tun*; at dusk, *meng*—sovereign and minister.\nBy night, *fu*; by day, *gou*—guest and host.\n\nThe azure-clad maiden rides the Azure Dragon,\nWhile the White Tiger accompanies the Golden Elder.\nThe Three Flowers blaze in the Divine Empyrean,\nTwin cranes linger at the Palace of the Great One.\n\nAll comes from metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—\nHow much suffering in birth, aging, sickness, and death?\nBut teach benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust,\nAnd naturally, the five tones align.\n\nFrom *zi* to *si*: *Zhen*, *Dui*, *Qian*;\nFrom *wu* to *hai*: *Xun*, *Gen*, *Kun*.\n*Kan* and *Li* are the palaces of union,\n*Mao* and *you* their gates of entry and exit.\n\nThe Chamber, Void, Encouragement, and Star stand through the four seasons;\nThe two equinoxes and two solstices open and close.\nIf you observe the undivided chaos before separation,\nYou will see the true playfulness of creation.\n\nWho knows the Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid\nLies only in the daily use of the present person?\nI reveal the essence of elixir refinement:\nNeither bustling city nor quiet mountain—\n\nThe elixir’s head was originally knotted before birth,\nPure, wondrous, luminous, and radiant.\nExternally, it is neither cinnabar nor sulfur;\nInternally, it is neither essence nor blood.\n\nFire and medicine originally dwell in one place—\nSeeming to exist when observed, vanishing when sought.\nI teach you to be silent as a fool all day,\nRefining a single wish-fulfilling pearl.\n\nThe true gold of the Great Crucible never changes hue,\nYet how can it be found amid the dust?\nBorn and dying countless times,\nThus, now we practice refinement.\n\nClearly, it is gold within unformed water—\nSeek it intently in the Flowery Pond.\nEight ounces of gold, eight ounces of water—\nOne floats, one sinks.\n\nGather the Five Phases within *geng* and *jia*;\nThe Four Symbols and Five Phases must harmonize.\nAt midnight, the Golden Crow enters the Broad Cold,\nWhite as lard, yellow as wax.\n\nThe essence of metal and the fluid of wood are fundamentally empty—\nTender, they must be gathered; aged, they wither.\nWhen hot, the *kun* fire is slightly buried;\nWhen cold, the *xun* wind blows gently.\n\nWithin stillness, one movement; within movement, one stillness.\nWithin stillness, one illumination; within illumination, one use.\n\nThe wind-blown willow is true lead,\nThe rain-washed peach blossom is true mercury.\nThe Three Passes creak with the Purple River Chariot,\nThe Nine Cauldrons gleam with golden sand.\n\nThe Purple Court’s Dark Tortoise feeds on white snow,\nThe Elixir Field’s Vermilion Phoenix pecks at yellow sprouts.\nThe moon in the sky, the tide in the earth—\nTheir waxing and waning respond to fullness and emptiness.\n\nThis is the mechanism of drawing forth and adding,\nThe very bones of creation in the void.\n\nKnow well the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source—\nThe subtle interplay of mutual generation and conquest.\nSeize the celestial mechanism to achieve great work—\nThe month within the year, the hour within the day.\n\nWhen at last it is forged into a single mass,\nI ask you, do you understand?\n\nNeither increase nor decrease—why speak of drawing forth and adding?\nNeither departure nor arrival—why speak of advance and retreat?\nWaxing and waning, decline and flourishing come in their own time,\nAs punishment and virtue stand at the gate, now even, now odd.\n\nWhen the elixir is complete, you must bathe it;\nDefend the city, wage war in the wilds—beware of peril.\nTo nurture the infant, rely solely on the mother;\nFor seven returns and nine reversions, know well the master.\n\nOne line firm, one line yielding,\nOne phase civil, one phase martial.\nIn but a moment’s work, the refining is done,\nYet a year’s fire-tending begins the embryo’s gestation.\n\nNine ascents, nine returns make nine revolutions,\nThunder’s roar shakes gods and ghosts alike.\nThe elixir’s work takes but ten months—\nGradually gathered, gradually refined, gradually congealed.\nThree years, nine years, and at last it matures,\nBegetting sons and grandsons by the hundreds of millions.\n\nLong ago, reading the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger*,\nI found the turning of dragon and tiger therein hard to fathom.\nSongs, poems, and concordant treatises I searched through all,\nYet still the golden elixir’s learning remained unmastered.\n\nIn the spring of the *dingchou* year of Jiading,\nA Daoist with unkempt hair appeared,\nSlipping into my sleeve a scroll—\nEach word a golden elixir’s secret.\nAfter the Daoist departed, he vanished without trace,\nLeaving no sign in the northern seas or Cangwu’s peaks.\nI asked others of his form and bearing—\nThey said this was the Old Man of the White Toad.\n\nAlas for those in the world who seek immortality!\nClinging to images, grasping at texts, they mistake the false.\nHow could they know one thing ever abides with them?\nRound or treacherous, steep or flushed—ever radiant.\nReturning with the secret, I tested the refining—\nDragon and tiger clashed in but a moment’s time.\n\nThose who know it in the Nineflower Heavens,\nOne night’s wind and thunder shake ten thousand mountains.\nI dwell by the Luojiang’s shores,\nWhere bright moon and clear wind are inexhaustible treasures.\n\nIdly I compose this *Song of the Great Dao*,\nTo serve as a model for the people of this age.\nNot yet speaking of immortality through elixir-refining,\nFirst seek the body’s firmness to prolong the years.\nIf one may yet have a share in ascension,\nThen, faint and distant, a white crane mounts the azure sky.\n\nHere ends the *Collected Questions on the Dao* of Haiqiong.",

One fascicle, composed by Bai Yuchan in a state of mystical absorption, compiled by Liu Yuanchang. Originating from the Southern Song dynasty.\n**Source of Base Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Haiqiong Inquiries on the Dao* Collection**\n\nUpon reading Han Changli’s verses on Peach Blossom Spring, one’s thoughts drift to the ethereal realm of immortals; upon reading Bai Juyi’s odes to sea and mountain, one’s heart stirs with longing to return to Tuṣita. The human mind, rootless, generates wisdom in response to words.\n\nAlas! I have heard that immortality can be learned, that deathlessness can be attained through effort. Not that I claim mastery—only that I aspire to study it! From youth, my heart has been lashed by the pursuit of Daoist cultivation, and unawares, the years have passed from *renzi* to *dingchou*. How fleeting are the years of this world! How can this sack of skin and bone endure such weariness?\n\nHeaven, in its grace, has granted me gradual access to the Dao. In that spring, I encountered the true master, Lord Haiqiong—Bai, styled Yuchan—who some say was from Hainan, though others suspect his family hailed from Xiang or Mian. At times, his hair wild and feet bare, he plunged into the bustling marketplace; at others, clad in a green headscarf and rustic robes, he wandered through palaces and temples. Adrift among the common folk, none recognized him.\n\nHe claimed to be twenty-one, yet had delved into the Three Teachings’ texts without exception. In conversation, his command of classics and history flowed like a spring—surpassing even the most learned scholars of our age. His calligraphy—seal, clerical, cursive, and standard—revealed a mind of wondrous clarity. The qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting were but occasional diversions. Those who associated with him were all the era’s most eminent scholars, yet even his admirers found it difficult to draw near.\n\nThough he carried no paper, his brush filled the land; though he traversed rivers and lakes, his name resounded across the realm—so numerous were his followers. Often, his pouch held not a single copper coin or grain of millet for sustenance. At times, drunk beyond measure, he would summon thunder; in deep sleep, he could dispatch memorials to the heavens. Joy or anger, laughter or tears—his demeanor seemed unhinged, yet his words sometimes aligned with fortune or misfortune. His zeal for aiding the world and benefiting others was unceasing.\n\nHe would sit through the night by candlelight, or sing all day with hands clapping the railing. Neither morning baths nor daytime meals concerned him; for years, he treated fire and water as if they did not exist. Some marveled at his ears and eyes, while others heard him discourse in riddles with his teeth—though the meaning remained obscure. Sober without wine, dazed upon waking, his writings and sayings have been carved on steles and published by scholars across the land.\n\nNow, his wrath outweighs his caution, and he stands at odds with the world—yet those who revere him are drawn as if by magnet and needle! He entrusted me with texts on the Nine Cauldrons, golden lead, cinnabar, and mercury; with the secrets of the Great Monad’s elixir knife, fire talismans, and golden liquor; with the *Purple Empyrean*’s writings on summoning wind and thunder. I, Yuanchang, reflect that in the past, I offended Heaven, lost my true self, and fell into this world—how could I deserve such teachings? I vow to devote my body to their cultivation, that I may not betray what I have learned.\n\nThus, I have gathered a few of his enlightening exchanges and had them carved into wood, that fellow seekers across the Four Seas may find inspiration. Lord Bai received these teachings from Chen Niuwan; Chen from Xue Daoguang; Xue from Shi Tai; Shi from Zhang Pingshu; Zhang from Liu Haichan; and Liu from Lü Dongbin.\n\nSince all know his character, what need have I to elaborate further? With this, I bow twice in reverence.\n\n**Ziyuanzi Liu Yuanchang**\n\n---\n\n**The *Haiqiong Inquiries on the Dao* Collection**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Haiqiong Inquiries on the Dao* Collection.

      "translated_text": "**The Dragon-Tiger Rhapsody**\n\nMarvelous indeed! The ninefold-transmuted golden liquor, the sevenfold-returned Great Elixir of Reversion—truly the *tārā* of spirit and qi, the primal father of nature and life. It grasps the primordial of Anavatapta, fulfilling the illustrious merit of Dharma. The body is cinnabar, the heart mercury—emerging with the sun, entering with the moon. The Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird—Mars abides in *gui*, bathing in the vast; the sovereign of the *bing* Crimson Palace presides over the profound vessel of the Yellow Court. Compassionate yet solemn, majestic yet refined.\n\nHeaven’s One is *Kan*, Earth’s Two is *Li*—*Qian* and *Kun* alternate between south and north. True lead, the qi of prior heaven, crowns the seventy-two minerals. Hard and soft, inner and outer, the principles of the feminine and masculine—metal and fire embrace, gold and water engage. At *Chujiu*, before the divine transformation, the heart of heaven cradles harmonious yang. Wood-mercury engenders the body of the eastern dawn; metal-essence matures the embryo of the western *xu*. *Xun* completes its return, *Qian* its decline—spring and autumn manifest benevolence and righteousness; winter and summer, their boundaries and measures.\n\nThe cauldrons of *Danlou*, above and below—cinnabar and mercury unite, moved within the divine chamber. *Xu* and *Wei* spread their wings—metal does not split, earth does not scatter. Concealed leaps and hidden flights—coming and going, ascending and descending without fixed hexagram, returning to the Great Ultimate to enfold all minerals. Being and non-being, concealment and revelation—water and metal become the elixir, their root the sun’s essence, extinguishing *Kan* and *Li*. Floating and sinking, waxing and waning.\n\nThe Metal Elder seeks the fullness of *Kan*; the Crone knocks on the emptiness of *Li*. Metal slays wood, water treasures fire. The Yellow Emperor plants his banner in the Metal Village—metal, wood, and fire transform into the dust of the Bright Window. The primordial chaos of metal and fire—precious essence culminates in the ninefold. One *jin* of sixteen *liang*, three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. The *Zhen* hexagram receives the yang tally—water is dark, metal ochre, earth yellow. Mountains and rivers, the great earth congeal the void—essence and fluid merge with cinnabar to fuse the true.\n\nBlack lead transmutes into pure vermilion; mercury gleams with azure radiance. The golden flower veils the vast emptiness. Water as one, fire as two, earth as five—soaking the flourishing metal, flying the essence of water. The supreme essence of heaven and earth—with *wu* and *ji* revolving the celestial tally, the twelve Dipper pivots and twelve bell pitches—flowing mercury, the sun’s soul; golden moon, the moon’s spirit. The dark diagram not yet worn away—yang essence is the father of the *Bifang*; *Kun* transforms into *Zhen* at the first, then into *Dui* at the second. Sun and moon conjoin as jade disks, the upper crescent level as a cord.\n\nThe three fives and three yangs complete their circle—round brilliance appears in the eastern *jia*. The toad gazes at the hexagram’s nodes; the hare’s spirit emits living light. *Qian* first transforms into *Xun*, then into *Gen*—the moon shines in *xin*, revealing *bing*. Five and six cycles revolve—northeast loses its companion in the *yi* land. Earth and wood, metal harmonize into liquid, returning to the semblance of *Chan*. The divine chamber of the thunderous dawn—within, the five agents; without, the eight trigrams. Yin tally and yang fire—six decades transmute the hen’s egg; the Five Peaks stand in concealment. The pivot’s crown is *Qian*-metal; its heel, *Kun*-water. Yin and yang receive from nature—central harmony flows in purity. The numinous gate is black; lead refines true earth. The spring cavern births white metal—quicksilver.\n\nAt *hai*-end, yang stirs—the sun’s chariot traverses the southern lands. The five stars align in a pearl-string; metal and cinnabar breathe in unison. The slowness and swiftness of sun and moon—the Purple Tenuity’s sixteen stars of the Canopy, the Three Terraces’ harmonizing stars—demand governance and record. The sun’s fire unites the essence of the five agents, refining the earth of the central palace. The moon’s metal receives the discipline of the six pitches, entering the water of the northern quarter.\n\nFire is the elixir’s parents; the elixir, fire’s descendants. Water, earth, and metal—sixty days determine prior and subsequent life and death. Metal and mercury lock horns; the crucible and chamber stand in balance. The earth-mother summons the harmony of the four directions—*Qian* stirs, responding to the Three Luminaries. The essence and qi of metal and fire illuminate the chamber—how could water dry up and fire perish? The qi of dragon and tiger intertwine; the affections of metal and wood unite. Emotion and nature intertwine—warmly nurturing the child-pearl.\n\nWater is the dark flower; earth, the metal-mother. The elixir chamber congeals flowing pearls—yellow and black blend the primordial essence of water and earth. Purple blossoms spread their richness; yellow liquid ripples. The divine medicine not yet mature—metal generates water. Refining lead into white metal, white metal into the divine chamber. The divine chamber holds metal-water—the fire’s hue transforms, congealing into yellow ascent. Water and fire coagulate in the central palace—golden liquor does not fly. Fire scorches the golden flower—light smoke, thin mist, then silence.\n\nWhite metal is being; fire’s qi, non-being. Refining mercury heralds the divine, the twofold emptiness. Water and fire embrace purity; sun and moon hold the void. Black lead—metal’s essence, dark water—envelops *Kan*-mercury. The yellow sprout appears; the white medicine, the red bud of metal—water’s mother, the Flowery Pond overflows with the true. The plain altar, the furnace’s tortoise, holds the divine chamber—its winding paths and barrier dikes. Metal and earth unite with mercury—naturally, the divine transformation is complete!\n\n---\n\n**The Song of the Crow and Hare**\n\nAh! The wonder of the golden liquor’s Great Elixir of Reversion—its subtlety pervades the cosmos, sinking into the bones of the void. At dawn’s glow, the Dipper ascends to the left; at dusk’s dust, it turns to the right. In the sun’s palace, the hare leaps; in the moon’s mansion, the crow soars. The Alchemical Maiden rides the red dragon; the Metal Elder crouches on the black tiger. Cinnabar gestates mercury; lead seals silver. The four images reach their limit; the five agents govern through earth. The Yellow Matron dons a rainbow skirt; *ding* faces forward, clad in azure mist. Black and white divide the Mysterious Female; the Flowery Pond emits jade nectar. The Red Child gives birth to the dark pearl; the red furnace smelts hard metal.\n\nThe green turtle’s feet are red; the white toad’s back is black. Jade creepers flourish in the divine valley; golden millet sprouts in the cinnabar field. The *pāṭala* flower blooms; the *devas’* clouds scatter their leaves. The southern *Ji* and *Yaoyao*; the northern *Shao* and the dark record of *Li*. The celestial scheme—sun and moon repeat; Mars establishes the six voids. The wind-wheel and water-fire *Gou*—the vast womb, the three-line embryo. Two and three, nursing complete; five and six, ninety-nine cycles. Locusts fly in summer snow; grass thrives in winter’s heat.",

radiance transforms into halberds and spears;\nThe recumbent moon’s furnace forges the celestial stem.\nThe cinnabar tripod stands atop Kunlun;\n*Qian*’s origin, *Qian*’s *Zhun* and *Meng*;\n*Kun*’s function, *Kun*’s *Pi* and *Tai*.\n\nChang’e pairs with Rāhu;\nYang Li weds the lunar comet.\nClear and turbid are discerned in mud;\nFloating and sinking are sought in fire.\nHost and guest mutually punish and empower;\nGeneration and conquest reciprocate grace and harm.\n\nTwo eights form double bowstrings;\nTwo sevens and nine compose *Qian*.\nThe killing mechanism kills in *Gen*;\nDrilling and refining belong to *Zhen*.\n\nThe Great One gestates *Wu* and *Ji*;\nAll things are but wind and moon.\nIron, tin, copper, *tou*, silver—\nTransform to birth the purple lotus leaves.\n\nOne asks of the lotus leaves:\nA numinous fragrance suffuses the smoke-laden thoroughfare.\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthy as frost;\nThe Most High Lord Lao as cherry blossoms.\n\nAlas!\nThe *Mysterious Pass* reveals its esoteric discourse:\nA single word, half a phrase—thus the profound is penetrated.\nWhy need a thousand, ten thousand scrolls of alchemical texts?\nIf one is not burdened by form,\nBefore one’s eyes lies the Great Heavenly Net.\n\nShould one wish to refine form and spirit,\nOne must recognize returning to the root and restoring life.\nThus the Dao returns to the root through the root’s aperture;\nRestoring life seeks the life-restoring pass.\nAs for this pass and aperture—\nIf one knows their true reality,\nThen returning to the root and restoring life pose no difficulty.\n\nHence it is said:\nShould one wish to know the immortal’s art,\nOne must but search for the root of creation.\nOf old, Emptiness gave birth to the Spontaneous;\nThe Spontaneous gave birth to the Great Dao;\nThe Great Dao gave birth to the One Qi;\nThe One Qi divided into Yin and Yang;\nYin and Yang became Heaven and Earth;\nHeaven and Earth gave birth to the myriad things—\nThis is the root of creation.\n\nThis is the True One’s Qi,\nAntecedent to all phenomena,\nThe Grand Void, the Grand Nonbeing,\nThe Grand Emptiness, the Grand Mystery.\nVast and obscure, immeasurable by inches;\nBoundless and surging, unfathomable by shores.\nIts greatness has no exterior;\nIts smallness has no interior.\nVast enough to embrace Heaven and Earth;\nMinute enough to enter the tip of a hair.\nAbove, no further hue;\nBelow, no further abyss.\nOne thing, round and luminous,\nManifesting through the ages—\nThat which cannot be named.\n\nThe sage, with heart, apprehends it;\nReluctantly, names it the Dao.\nThus to know that the heart itself is the Dao.\nTherefore, without heart, one merges with the Dao;\nWith heart, one strays from the Dao.\nOnly this word “without”:\nEncompasses all existence without remainder,\nGenerates the myriad things without exhaustion.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast,\nThey can command the formed,\nBut cannot command the formless.\nThough Yin and Yang are subtle,\nThey can command the qi-endowed,\nBut cannot command the qi-less.\nThough the Five Phases are most refined,\nThey can command the numbered,\nBut cannot command the numberless.\nThough a hundred thoughts arise in tumult,\nThey can command the conscious,\nBut cannot command the unconscious.\n\nNow, those who cultivate this principle—\nWould do well first to refine the form.\nThe marvel of refining form lies in congealing spirit.\nWhen spirit congeals, qi gathers;\nWhen qi gathers, the elixir forms;\nWhen the elixir forms, the body solidifies;\nWhen the body solidifies, spirit is complete.\n\nThus Song Qiqiu said:\nForget form to nurture qi;\nForget qi to nurture spirit;\nForget spirit to nurture emptiness.\nOnly this word “forget”—\nThis is the state of no-thing.\nOriginally, there was not one thing—\nWhere could dust alight?\nThis is what is meant.\n\nIf one can savor this principle,\nAnd labor upon this word “forget,”\nOne may enter the profound subtleties of the Great Dao,\nSeize the marvelous workings of spontaneity,\nEstablish the elixir’s foundation in an instant,\nAnd circulate creation within one’s body.\n\nYet this Dao—\nGazed upon, it is desolate and nothing is seen;\nListened to, it is obscure and nothing is heard.\nOnly with the heart can one see its images;\nOnly with the heart can one hear its sounds.\nIf the Daoist adept,\nWith darkened heart and congealed spirit,\nAttains emptiness and preserves stillness,\nThen the empty chamber generates brightness—\nTruly, this is spontaneity.\n\nOnly the Most High saves beings,\nTeaching people to cultivate and refine:\nTaking Heaven and Earth as the crucible,\nThe crow and hare as medicinal substances,\nThe sun’s essence’s ascent and descent corresponding to qi and blood’s rise and fall,\nThe moon’s spirit’s waxing and waning corresponding to essence and spirit’s ebb and flow,\nThe four seasons’ nodes corresponding to a day’s hours,\nThe celestial revolution’s stellar count corresponding to a furnace’s alchemy.\n\nThus:\nGather essence and spirit as medicine;\nTake stillness and quiescence as fire.\nWith the fire of stillness and quiescence,\nRefine the medicine of essence and spirit—\nThus is the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor formed.\nFor the union of true Yin and true Yang,\nThe pairing of one water and one fire,\nFirst discern floating and sinking,\nThen clarify host and guest,\nScrutinize the operations of withdrawal and addition,\nExamine the perils of reversal and repetition.\n\nAs Gao Xiangxian said:\n“Gather on the appointed day;\nTake at the proper time.”\nAs Liu Haichan said:\n“Opening and closing, Heaven and Earth’s creative power—\nForge and refine a furnace of true sun and moon.”\nThose who comprehend this\nEmulate the sun and moon’s workings,\nAnd share the same merit as Heaven and Earth.\n\nHow could one know:\nHeaven nurtures without image;\nEarth nurtures without form.\nThus Heaven is long, Earth enduring;\nSun radiant, moon luminous—\nThe True One eternally abides;\nEmptiness never perishes.\n\nNow, I model myself upon this:\nNo affairs for the heart;\nNo heart for affairs.\nInwardly observe the heart—\nThe heart has no heart.\nOutwardly observe the form—\nThe form has no form.\nObserve things afar—\nThings have no things.\nKnow the heart is heartless;\nKnow the form is formless;\nKnow things are thingless—\nTranscend the myriad illusions,\nSteadfastly, one numinous essence.\n\nThe ancient scripture says:\n“It gave birth to me in emptiness,\nPlaced me in nothingness.”\nThus one should return to the root of nature’s primordial beginning,\nRevert to the state before one’s birth.\nHide the heart within the heart, yet it is not seen;\nConceal spirit within spirit, yet it does not emerge.\nThus one can:\nRoundly penetrate the three times,\nStilling the myriad threads;\nPurify the six roots,\nEmptying the square inch to clarity.\nNot clinging to emptiness,\nNot clinging to nothingness—\nEmpty all that is empty;\nVoid all that is void.\nUntil emptiness is empty of emptiness,\nVoid is void of void—\nPure, bare, naked, and unadorned—\nThen the numinous alone abides.\n\nThe Dao does not desire emptiness;\nEmptiness naturally returns to it.\nIf one can empty the heart,\nThe Dao naturally returns to one.",

      "translated_text": "As in the poem of Shi Jianwu of old:\n*\"Qi is the medicine that adds years,\nThe heart commands qi as its spirit.\nWho masters spirit and qi\nBecomes an immortal indeed.\"*\n\nThis verse is simple yet profoundly abstruse. Jade Toad, upon reading it, recited it naturally until the autumn moon shone bright in the sky, and the void dissolved into the realm of decay—only those who are withered wood and cold ash could not comprehend this.\n\nSince you have attained this, I dare not keep silent. The Supreme Mysterious Statutes say:\n*\"To meet someone and not transmit is to lose the Heavenly Dao;\nTo transmit to the unworthy is to leak the Heavenly Treasure.\"*\nAcross land and sea, I have sought in vain for one worthy—transmission must not be reckless, lest I incur Heaven’s censure. Yet fearing the Great Dao may go untransmitted and the elixir arts fade into oblivion, I compose *The Manifest Secret of the Mysterious Pass*, to enlighten this world and instruct later learners, preserving the slender thread of the golden elixir.\n\nStill, I worry that people remain ignorant of this principle, so I shall speak further: With the eye, see the eye; with the ear, hear the ear; with the nose, regulate the nose; with the mouth, seal the mouth. Concealment and soaring flight both arise from the one heart. First, cultivate stillness and concentrate the spirit, restrain anger and suppress desire. When anger is restrained and desire suppressed, water and fire achieve harmony; when water and fire harmonize, metal and wood unite; when metal and wood unite, the true earth returns to its place; when the true earth returns, the golden elixir naturally grows as large as a millet grain, adding one grain each day. Spirit returns, qi is restored, filling heaven and earth. As Mencius said of nurturing the vast and mighty qi—this is it.\n\nWhen liver-qi is whole, there is benevolence; when lung-qi is whole, there is righteousness; when heart-qi is whole, there is propriety; when kidney-qi is whole, there is wisdom; when spleen-qi is whole, there is trust. If one’s qi is deficient, one lacks benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—how can such a one be called human? Those who cultivate emptiness and nurture the vast, whose hearts are expansive and bodies at ease, find the qi-mother already formed, and the elixir easily coalesces. How can one not cherish this nurturance to preserve one’s boundless self? Let scholars ponder this.\n\nRespectfully inscribed and entrusted to Liu Ziyuan.\n\n**The Recluse of Hidden Mountain’s Writings**\nJade Toad withdrew from the world and reclined high upon Ge Mountain’s peak. A visitor asked: \"What is the essence of reclusion in the mountains? What joy does it bring?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Those who excel at mountain reclusion do not know the joy of reclusion; those who know its joy are like birds that must choose their trees or fish that must choose their waters. The joy of mountain dwellers lies not in the mountains themselves, but in the heart’s joy—when heart and mountain become one. Facing circumstances without attachment, facing the heart without circumstance—this is the true joy of reclusion!\"\n\nThe visitor asked: \"If the essence of mountain reclusion is thus, do mountain recluses not know the flavor of the mountains?\"\n\nHe replied: \"The flavor of the mountains is the joy of the mountains. The recluse knows the flavor of the Dao, not the flavor of the mountains. Let me tell you of what my ears have heard and eyes have seen.\"\n\nThe visitor assented.\n\nHe continued: \"The recluse must not let the joy of the mountains sway the heart, nor let the heart’s joy cling to the mountains. The mountain is the mountain, the heart is the heart. The recluse does not ask, 'What were people like in ancient times? What are they like now?'—this mountain is as it is, that mountain is as it is. There are those who reclude in mountains, times for reclusion, and joys of reclusion. In such times, sages and worthies gather; people esteem virtue and Dao; their joy lies in refining form and spirit. Yet I fear that with such knowledge and perception, nine or ten out of ten will fall short of the ancients!\n\nThe mountain recluse is not one who must dwell among peaks and ridges—without peaks and ridges, there are still mountains. Each person has their own mountain of reclusion. Those who are clear, empty, tranquil, lofty, and explore the profound—this is the mountain of the person, the mountain of the heart. Those entangled in right and wrong, honor and disgrace, poverty and wealth, high and low—this is the marketplace of the person, the marketplace of the heart. Today, some say great reclusion lies in secluded villages, while lesser reclusion lies in the mountains—this is not without reason.\n\nSince the habits of fame and profit burn fiercely, and worldly desires assail the mind, one grows weary of noise and seeks quiet. But when the joy of tranquility fills the heart and the impulse for cultivation cools, one grows weary of quiet and seeks noise. Yet if one can establish this heart, whether in a secluded garden or a bustling marketplace, it remains the same heart. There is no need to flee the heart’s noise to satisfy its desires, nor to delight in a superior environment or resent an inferior one. Knowing the mountain as it is, rejoicing in the heart as it is—this is true reclusion!\n\nTo reclude in mountains, first reclude the heart. Without affairs, govern the heart—this is reclusion; with affairs, respond to the near—this is the mountain. Without heart for the mountain, without mountain in the heart. Thus, one must first recognize the Dao before recluding in the mountains. If one dwells in the mountains before knowing the Dao, seeing the mountain, one forgets the Dao. If one knows the Dao before dwelling in the mountains, pursuing the Dao, one forgets the mountain. Forgetting the mountain, the Dao-nature gladdens the spirit; forgetting the Dao, the mountain’s form obscures the eyes. Thus, forgetting the mountain reveals the Dao—even the human world becomes still. Seeing the mountain and forgetting the Dao, even the mountains become noisy.\n\nWhen all dharmas are empty and merged, when every thought is empty and still—what city is too noisy? What mountain marsh is too quiet? If the mountain is quiet yet the heart is always noisy, it is no different from the marketplace. If the marketplace is noisy yet the heart is always quiet, it is no different from the mountain. Noisy yet not noisy—what quiet remains to seek? Speech and silence are but mountains; movement and stillness are but markets. Serenity rests within, undisturbed; freedom and ease manifest outwardly—like fish and kites soaring in the sky and abyss. One simply follows what brings joy!\"",

      "translated_text": "The joy here is not the joy of the ears and eyes, nor the joy that follows; it is not the joy of emotions and perceptions, nor the joy that follows. Joy resides in the heart—it cannot be described in form, nor grasped by knowledge or sight.\n\nThe joy of the heart is the joy of the recluse, untouched by mountains. The pure and still is one’s Dao-ground; serenity and retreat are one’s practice; peace and bliss are one’s kin. One desires no commerce with the world, no entanglement with things. In cultivating the body, one does not serve the hundred limbs; in nourishing form, one does not indulge in the five flavors. One regards the day of death as no different from the year of life, and treats possessions as though they were nothing.\n\nIn quiet meditation, clouds drift through valleys and mist swirls among peaks; in walking meditation, moonlight fills the grottoes and wind stirs the forests. Deer and elk are one’s companions; pines and bamboo are one’s neighbors. One enjoys the wealth of spring leeks and autumn chrysanthemums, the nobility of morning mist and evening dew.\n\nAs for clothing—plaited grass and knotted rushes, woven reeds and sewn orchids. As for food—steamed ginseng and mashed poria, pine-nut rice and cypress-leaf gruel. One drinks from the crystalline springs of stone marrow, feeds on the rich earth of mountain liver. One walks before withered trees, sits beneath ancient cliffs, dwells in deep forests and secluded valleys, sleeps upon mossy stones.\n\nBy day, one chants long to the secluded clouds and springs; by night, one sleeps alone in the depths of mist and haze. In heat and cold, the heart is warmed by the Dao and knows not summer’s heat; the heart is chilled by the Dao and knows not winter’s cold. Knowing winter’s cold, frost and ice crisp the skin yet do not alter the bearing of pines and cedars; wind and snow freeze the body yet do not change the integrity of mountains and stones. Knowing summer’s heat, scorching sun drenches one in sweat yet does not stir a mind of vexation; blazing fire burns without yet does not move within.\n\nRoaming freely through valleys and hills, wandering boundlessly across open fields, the body moves with ease, the heart rests in stillness. I fear that beneath the city’s roofs, the clamor of voices and colors, the entanglements of dust and toil—five hues may blind the eyes, five tones deafen the ears, five desires muddy the heart. Once they enter the heart, if the heart does not admit them, they shake it by day and overturn it by night. With no anchor in the heart, one is swept away by affairs, ensnared by things.\n\nYet even in the mountains and wilds, is it truly different? Wildflowers and grasses may dazzle the eyes; rare birds and bright finches may captivate the ears. If one does not conceal the heart and seeks only to hide in the mountains—can this be called reclusion?\n\nThe intent of the ancient sages in retiring to the mountains was indeed thus; but the act of retiring to the mountains was not. The world rushes toward profit, customs drown in desire, sunk in the intoxication of fame and gain, dreaming in the realm of self and others—born and dying without awareness, trading sin for blessing without notice. This is what the sage grieves over, and so the sage retreats.\n\nThe sage’s grief is not grief of the heart, but grief for others; the sage’s retreat is not retreat to the mountains, but retreat of the heart. Thus, the body is but straw dogs to the form of the sentient, while gold and jade are to the nature of the sentient. It is not the form that is refined beyond the mountains, but the nature that is perfected within them. Only the sage understands this.\n\nDo you wish to hear of the flavors of the mountains, the essence of the mountains? The mountain as mountain, the person as person—one need not necessarily hide in the mountains to retreat, nor must the mountains depend on people to exist. To dwell in the mountains, to walk in reclusion, without stirring thoughts of vexation—straw huts and bamboo cottages, grass mats and pine-wood stoves cannot make one cold; dense forests and tall bamboo, cool winds and chilled springs cannot make one hot. One laughs and wanders amidst mist and clouds, reclines and rises with wind and rain, finding joy where others cannot, attaining what others cannot attain.\n\nThere are leaves for writing, flowers for twilight. One’s zither plays the wind through the pines; one’s wine drips like rain upon stone. In stillness, the heart finds Chan; in practice, the heart is refined. One sees tigers and wolves as household swine, calls bears and rhinos as one’s servants. Solitary as the cold ape’s night cry, at ease as the white cloud’s evening flight—neither court nor world can constrain the heart, neither life nor fate can trap the will.\n\nThis is called cultivating reclusion; this is called the mountain of reclusion. Such a mountain is not the mountain of the world; such a person is not the person of the world. Person and mountain transform together, mountain and person forget each other. The person is the heart; the mountain is the heart. This heart knows not which is mountain, which is person.\n\nIt can be known yet not known by knowing; it can be seen yet not seen by seeing. The wondrous subtlety of pure truth and tranquil emptiness is neither mountain nor person. This marvel of neither mountain nor person—like the moon in the waves, like the wind in the bamboo—cannot be spoken of and obtained.\n\nA guest said: I wish to follow these words and travel with you, Master.\nThe Master asked: Who are you?\nThe guest replied: I am Ziyuanzi.\n\n*Record of the Realm of Constant Radiance*\nJade Toad Elder laughs amidst the wind and moon of the clear and empty capital, abiding in the desolate and secluded realm of streams and mountains. Morning feasts on rosy clouds, evening feeds on purple mist—his four great elements are at ease, his one nature is joyful. He knows not whether spring and autumn seek to chill or warm him, nor whether sun and moon seek to yin or yang him. Half-drunk, half-dreaming, half-wandering, half-stumbling.\n\nThe sky, unobstructed by healing clouds, dawn’s radiance dazzles the eyes. Suddenly, the wind through bamboo groves turns cold, dark clouds veil the light, a fine rain clears the dust—mountains darken, waters fade, birds take flight, fish hide. Soon, the gloom lifts, the weather pleases, warm as spring, crisp as autumn. Colorful clouds soar in the southern azure; within them stands a figure—wearing the cap of carefree spontaneity, the shoes of ultimate reality, the robes of emptiness and profound stillness, feasting on the food of Chan joy and Dharma bliss.",
      "overlap_context": "n marsh is too quiet? If the mountain is quiet yet the heart is always noisy, it is no different from the marketplace. If the marketplace is noisy yet the heart is always quiet, it is no different from the mountain. Noisy yet not noisy—what quiet remains to seek? Speech and silence are but mountains; movement and stillness are but markets. Serenity rests within, undisturbed; freedom and ease manifest outwardly—like fish and kites soaring in the sky and abyss. One simply follows what brings joy!\"",

      "translated_text": "The ten eyes cannot perceive his form, the four ears cannot hear his voice. Mount Sumeru and Mount Lu cannot surpass his height, the ocean of Sarvajñā cannot encompass his intent. His steps follow flowing clouds and waters; his speech and silence are like emerald bamboo and golden blossoms.\n\nPresently, he spoke: *\"I am the Positionless True One—do you know me?\"* The World-Honored One shares a womb with ants, Tuṣita and the Iron Enclosure dwell in the same realm. You may dismiss the ministers who govern hearing, discharge the officials who oversee sight, and wander with only your shadow in the land beyond yin and yang.\n\nThe old man assented. His heart became clods of earth, his form a withered tree—thus he met the True One. It seemed as though they had once met by chance, yet their bond felt as if they had never before exchanged words. The True One and the old man, staffed with the staff of no-thought, unfurled the canopy of great function manifest—walking and resting, they wandered beyond the measure of day and night, traversing some one hundred eight thousand *li*. They first crossed the mountain of the five aggregates, sailed the sea of the six desires, departed the land of ignorance, and emerged from the realm of greed and craving.\n\nSuddenly, in a certain region, the True One said: *\"This is the Land of Constant Radiant Light of Great Wisdom, the Precept Province of Dhyāna County, the Village of Nothing-Whatsoever, the Hamlet of Nirvāṇa.\"* The True One was the sovereign of this land. His dwelling was the Palace of the Empty Heart, the Tower of Liberation, the Pavilion of Suchness, the Terrace of Quiescence, the Palace of Perfect Enlightenment, the Hall of True Insight. In this land, the earth bore no dust or mud, the sky knew no darkness or brightness. Here, ruler and subject, father and child, sage and commoner, all sentient beings shared the same form and appearance, without surname or name. Its adornments were beyond description, its enjoyments beyond measure.\n\nThe True One rode the chariot of the five wisdoms, mounted the seven-jeweled carriage, opened the treasury of light contending with emptiness, and planted the banner of spiritual power and sovereignty. Together with the old man, he roamed beneath the Peak of Knowledge and Vision, where lay the Mysterious Cavern, the River of Compassionate Endurance, and the Forest of Merit. After a long while, they traversed the Garden of Bodhi, the Garden of No-Form, the Eightfold Returning Parks, the Fourfold Enclosure and Ponds, strolled through the Grove of Samādhi, and climbed the Mountain of the Four Truths.\n\nWhen the True One wished to return, he boarded the Prajñā boat, crossed the Sea of Equality, and in less than the time it takes to snap a finger, completed the journey there and back. The Boundless True One bowed to the old man and sat in repose within the Pavilion of Pure Contention. He opened the sixfold doors and windows of supernatural powers, adorned the courtyard of myriad transformations, burned the incense of the five divisions, offered the six flavors of hunger, presented the tea of eightfold sovereignty, poured the water of the eight merits, displayed the pearl of the five eyes, revealed the seal of the one truth, set forth the torch of cessation and abiding, and lit the lamp of seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving.\n\nSuddenly, the True One vanished. The old man turned his head—his whereabouts were lost. Startled, he awakened, yet felt a sudden loss. He declared to the gods and men: *\"That True One resembled my form, mirrored my will. Am I not awake? Am I not sober? Shall I forsake what is real and cling to what is illusory?\"* Then, with a long sigh, he exclaimed: *\"I am the True One, the True One is I. I shall depart!\"*\n\nHe summoned Master Writ of the Walled City, Envoy Ink of the Pine, and commanded Clay Pot, White Qi, and others to record it, while Purple Prime wrote it down.\n\n---\n\n**Rhapsody on the Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid**\n\nThose who study the Dao must cultivate the golden elixir. When the body’s wood withers and the heart’s embers grow cold, to ascend to the jade towers, one must refine the golden elixir. The Qian horse and Kun ox guard Lord Ding within the sacred chamber; the Kan crow and Li hare unite the maiden with the true altar. The Scarlet Tower’s scattered officials and the Pure Court’s idle scholars command the Azure Dragon of Fusang to spread its wings and emerge from fire, while the White Tiger of Mount Hua bares its fangs and enters water.\n\nThe celestial furnace and earthen crucible are the pivot of the three passes’ transformations; the moon’s essence and sun’s spirit are a handful of yin and yang’s marrow.",

      "translated_text": "The lead conceals earth within, while mercury yields gold at its core; the tortoise embodies the *zi* trigram, the serpent the *wu* image. The hare is the creature of *mao*, the rooster the fowl of *you*. The Four Symbols and Five Phases never depart from *wu*; the Three Primes and Eight Trigrams rely upon *ren*.\n\nAt dawn, it is *tun*; at dusk, it is *meng*. The six lines bear form—by night, it must return; by day, it must meet. All things, devoid of intent, thus converge the Three Essences within the Primordial Palace. The two qi ascend and descend, spiraling along the Yellow Way.\n\nOnly a single taste of mercury, once transformed, becomes black jade; thus, sevenfold refined cinnabar becomes a crimson jewel. Citron and pomegranate, fire-pear and jujube—universal white snow flutters in the pure breeze of the Purple Court, while golden blossoms fill the courtyard, veiling the auspicious herbs of the Elixir Field.\n\nI know well what is drawn forth and what is added, where it is gathered, and where life and death reside. Waxing and waning follow their time; floating and sinking are the root of clarity and turbidity, while separation and union, motion and stillness, form their foundation. Nurture the upright to embrace the One; hold fullness and guard the feminine. None in the world can fathom this—all day they sit in stupor, knowing not where to turn.\n\nBlessing gives rise to harm, harm to blessing; the Chamber star meets the Pleiades. The host within the guest, the guest within the host—the Dipper’s measure revolves past the Winnowing Basket. Truly, the Great Dao speaks not, and the inner elixir is no mere technique. The Mystic Pearl hangs in its image, yin enfolding yang’s virtue; the infant forms its embryo, the masculine containing the feminine essence.\n\nBetween sovereign and minister, there is first and last, regret and shame; beyond husband and wife, there is survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune. The heart resides in *ding*’s position, the bow in *gui*’s; the maiden dwells in *jia*’s palace, the Net in *geng*’s. Though punishment and virtue wax and wane, with prosperity and adversity, bathing and concealment hold no fixed certainty—only the weight of medicinal ingredients.\n\nEast, west, south, and north converge at the center; the fire-timing of city and moat unites the two, eight, nine, and three. Thus, the Dark Crow’s river chariot ascends for a hundred moments, while the Flowery Pond’s divine water flows backward through the four seasons. Constructive and defensive qi shift with the Quail Fire and Ghost Well; spirit and essence wane and wax with the Dark Void and Dipper-Ox. Mother and child swiftly cover one another; body transforms, heart transforms. Brothers fill the flute, fortune refines, wisdom refines.\n\nThe six moving lines reveal the changes of new moon, full moon, and crescent; the two solstices alter their course, bringing fears of locusts, floods, and drought. The Perfected One roams the cosmos, mastering the subtle and vast; mountains return to his grasp. Left army, right army—since ancient times, benevolence and righteousness endure. Great reclusion, small reclusion—now the palace and horn winds whisper softly, the moon shines bright. A solitary cloud, a lone crane—then a long, resonant cry. These writings are left for later students.\n\n**Poem on the Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid**\nCrow and hare in the Qian-Kun crucible,\nTortoise and serpent on the *fu* and *gou* altar.\nThe world’s idle wanderers—\nWithin their hearts, the Great Return Elixir.\n\nThe White Tiger roars in water,\nThe Azure Dragon coils in fire.\nMercury and lead, muddy medicines gleam;\nMetal and wood, snowflakes turn cold.\n\n*Li* and *Kan* are not heart and kidney,\nEast and west not lung and liver.\nThree phrases exhaust the seven returns,\nNine revolutions bring forth the Mud Pill.\n\n**Song of the Dao’s Mystic Pivot**\nHave you not seen—\nA single grain of golden elixir, how resplendently red,\nLarge as a pellet, bright as a tangerine?\nEach person’s share is originally perfect,\nNightly, its numinous light fills the Spirit Chamber.\n\nThe Spirit Chamber is this numinous terrace,\nWithin it, the embryo of endless life.\nThe Primordial Lord calls it the Crescent Moon Furnace,\nWithin the furnace, the medicine mirrors the Three Terraces.\n\nAt first, one father faces one mother;\nAfterward, three sons and three daughters.\nAt dawn, *tun*; at dusk, *meng*—sovereign and minister.\nBy night, *fu*; by day, *gou*—guest and host.\n\nThe azure-clad maiden rides the Azure Dragon,\nWhile the White Tiger accompanies the Golden Elder.\nThe Three Flowers blaze in the Divine Empyrean,\nTwin cranes linger at the Palace of the Great One.\n\nAll comes from metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—\nHow much suffering in birth, aging, sickness, and death?\nBut teach benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust,\nAnd naturally, the five tones align.\n\nFrom *zi* to *si*: *Zhen*, *Dui*, *Qian*;\nFrom *wu* to *hai*: *Xun*, *Gen*, *Kun*.\n*Kan* and *Li* are the palaces of union,\n*Mao* and *you* their gates of entry and exit.\n\nThe Chamber, Void, Encouragement, and Star stand through the four seasons;\nThe two equinoxes and two solstices open and close.\nIf you observe the undivided chaos before separation,\nYou will see the true playfulness of creation.\n\nWho knows the Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid\nLies only in the daily use of the present person?\nI reveal the essence of elixir refinement:\nNeither bustling city nor quiet mountain—\n\nThe elixir’s head was originally knotted before birth,\nPure, wondrous, luminous, and radiant.\nExternally, it is neither cinnabar nor sulfur;\nInternally, it is neither essence nor blood.\n\nFire and medicine originally dwell in one place—\nSeeming to exist when observed, vanishing when sought.\nI teach you to be silent as a fool all day,\nRefining a single wish-fulfilling pearl.\n\nThe true gold of the Great Crucible never changes hue,\nYet how can it be found amid the dust?\nBorn and dying countless times,\nThus, now we practice refinement.\n\nClearly, it is gold within unformed water—\nSeek it intently in the Flowery Pond.\nEight ounces of gold, eight ounces of water—\nOne floats, one sinks.\n\nGather the Five Phases within *geng* and *jia*;\nThe Four Symbols and Five Phases must harmonize.\nAt midnight, the Golden Crow enters the Broad Cold,\nWhite as lard, yellow as wax.\n\nThe essence of metal and the fluid of wood are fundamentally empty—\nTender, they must be gathered; aged, they wither.\nWhen hot, the *kun* fire is slightly buried;\nWhen cold, the *xun* wind blows gently.\n\nWithin stillness, one movement; within movement, one stillness.\nWithin stillness, one illumination; within illumination, one use.\n\nThe wind-blown willow is true lead,\nThe rain-washed peach blossom is true mercury.\nThe Three Passes creak with the Purple River Chariot,\nThe Nine Cauldrons gleam with golden sand.\n\nThe Purple Court’s Dark Tortoise feeds on white snow,\nThe Elixir Field’s Vermilion Phoenix pecks at yellow sprouts.\nThe moon in the sky, the tide in the earth—\nTheir waxing and waning respond to fullness and emptiness.\n\nThis is the mechanism of drawing forth and adding,\nThe very bones of creation in the void.\n\nKnow well the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source—\nThe subtle interplay of mutual generation and conquest.\nSeize the celestial mechanism to achieve great work—\nThe month within the year, the hour within the day.\n\nWhen at last it is forged into a single mass,\nI ask you, do you understand?",
