Invocation*\n\nWe humbly acknowledge the wondrous primordial Dao/Way, perfect in its circularity and fixed in its position.\nFrom the gathering of light and clarity does the Heavenly Canopy (*Buying* 乾盖) arise,\nWhile the congealing of heavy and turbid forms the Earthly Realm (*Kunyu* 坤舆).\n\nGreat is the Kunlun’s expanse, its summit as the hub of the Earthly Wheel.\nAll the celestial hosts converge like spokes upon it,\nCircumnavigating the seas and flowing around.\nIt manifests the profound merit of bearing the heavy,\nAnd establishes the vast virtue of nurturing life.\n\nFurther, there are the thirty-six lands of the earth,\nAnd the nine layers of dense darkness.\nThe boundless void of the stubborn and empty,\nWhere wind-wheels and waters meet.\nThis is the realm of eternal night’s dim thoroughfare,\nThe shadowy domain of the dark.\n\nIt imprisons the moon’s essence in the abyss,\nAnd seals the departed spirits in the black prison.\nLayer upon layer of trials and torments,\nDay after day without respite.\nThe sufferings of the Five Torments are complete—\nHow can one transcend them?\n\nSins accumulate, binding the soul to the Five Paths of Rebirth,\nAnd transgressions deepen, condemning it to the Three Realms of Punishment.\nWere it not for the boundless compassion of the Great Dao/Way,\nIt would be impossible to escape the torments of the dark.\n\nThus, the Primordial Sovereign established the teaching,\nAnd the Most High descended the method.\nHe opened the Field of the Dao/Way’s Wheel for offering blessings,\nAnd performed the Ritual of the Illuminating Lamp to dispel darkness.\nHe transferred the spirits across the Five Paths,\nAnd lit the Nine Abysses.\nHe dispelled the obscuring gloom of the dark,\nAnd scattered the auspicious light into the world of the living.\nAll departed souls were universally granted passage,\nSwiftly ascending to the Pure Land,\nDirectly reaching the Realm of Non-Doing.\n\nNow, the officiant [name] in accordance with the *Yunzhen Zhenyuan* (True Essentials of the Mysterious Treasure),\nLights the Radiant Wheel Lamp,\nTo supercede and liberate the departed spirit and form of [name],\nAnd all tormented souls.\n\nBy this benevolent light, they escape the Five Paths of suffering,\nTheir six senses purified, all sins eradicated.\nTogether with the Nine Ancestors and Seven Mysteries,\nThe Four Generations and Six Paths,\nAll are liberated from darkness,\nAnd enter the realm of radiant clarity.\nThe assembly of the Dao/Way returns to reliance,\nOn the boundless, supreme Dao/Way.\n\n**First Invocation: The Path of Color-Binding Torment (Sèlèi Kǔxīn Mén)**\n*To the Venerable Sound-Seeking Savior of the Five Paths, First Torment: The Gate of Torment Bound by Color*\n\nUnrestrained by emotion and desire,\nThe heart is drowned by lascivious colors.\nAfter death, one suffers the torments of the Knife Mountain Hell.\n\nNow, the officiant [name] lights this divine lamp,\nIn memorial for the departed [name],\nTo benefit the Six Paths,\nAnd attain rebirth in the living realm.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Nine Purity’s (*Jiǔqīng* 九清) compassionate gaze,\nAnd the Three Luminaries’ (*Sānjǐng* 三景) returning light,\nMay descend with boundless mercy,\nAnd alleviate the sufferings of the Knife Mountain Hell.\n\nAlas, the torments of the Knife Mountain Hell!\nTowering blades of snow rise cold in the void.\nThe Ox-Headed demons drive the condemned to climb,\nTheir flesh and bones scattered as they fall to the knives.\n\nThis is the torment of the heart bound by color,\nWhere every step on the Knife Mountain brings wounds.\nWe rely on the Venerable Savior of the Five Paths,\nMay the Great and Mighty Spirit shatter the blades.\n\n*With the inconceivable merit and power.*\n\n**Second Invocation: The Path of Love-Binding Torment (Àilèi Kǔshén Mén)**\n*To the Great and Venerable Lord of the Five Paths, Second Torment: The Gate of Torment Bound by Love*\n\nLove clings to all desires,\nAnd disrupts the mind and spirit.\nAfter death, one suffers the torments of the Swords Forest Hell.\n\nNow, the officiant [name] lights this divine lamp,\nIn memorial for the departed spirit and form of [name],\nTo benefit the Six Paths,\nAnd attain rebirth in the living realm.\n\nWe humbly pray to the Venerable Lord of the Five Paths,\nAnd the Great and Venerable Lord of the Boundless Void,\nTo extend boundless compassion,\nAnd widely bestow liberation.\n\nWe sincerely repent the sufferings of the Swords Forest Hell.\nWe prostrate before the Venerable Lord of the Great Void,\nAnd the Supreme Origin of Jade Capital and Golden Gate.\n\nMay Your mighty light universally illuminate the Swords Forest,\nAnd shatter the blades and frost of its torment.\nThe bitter pains of suffering now cease,\nAnd the injured flesh and bones are fully restored.\nThe Wheel Lamp’s radiance guides them out of the dark prison,\nSwiftly ascending to the realm of supreme bliss.\n\n*With the inconceivable merit and power.*\n\n**Third Invocation: The Path of Greed-Binding Torment (Tānlèi Kǔxíng Mén)**\n*To the Venerable Lord of the Five Paths, Third Torment: The Gate of Torment Bound by Greed*\n\nGreed for fame and profit,\nExhausts the *qi* and weakens the form.\nAfter death, one suffers the torments of the Copper Pillar Hell.\n\nNow, the officiant [name] lights this divine lamp,\nIn memorial for the departed spirit and form of [name],\nTo ascend to the Heavenly Realm,\nAnd benefit the Six Paths,\nAttaining rebirth in the living realm.\n\nWe humbly pray to the Supreme Sage of Jade Emptiness,\nAnd the Venerable Lord of the Golden Gate,\nTo universally descend Your boundless compassion,\nAnd transfer the departed souls.\nWe sincerely repent the torments of the Copper Pillar Hell.\n\nWe humbly invoke the High and Venerable Sage of the Supreme Void,\nMay You descend Your vast creation,\nAnd rescue those lost in the dark paths.\nYour flowing grace

guides them out of the dark prison,\nAnd grants them liberation to be reborn in the Heavenly Realm.\n\n*With the inconceivable merit and power.*\n\n**Fourth Invocation: The Path of Vanity-Binding Torment (Huājìng Kǔjīng Mén)**\n*To the Venerable Lord of the Five Paths, Fourth Torment: The Gate of Torment Bound by Vanity*\n\nGreed for honor and glory,\nExhausts the spirit and scatters the *qi*.\nAfter death, one suffers the torments of the Boiling Cauldron Hell.\n\nNow, the officiant [name] lights this divine lamp,\nIn memorial for the departed [name],\nTo ascend to the Heavenly Realm,\nAnd benefit the Six Paths,\nAttaining rebirth in the living realm.\n\nWe humbly pray to the Venerable Lord of Non-Doing,\nAnd the Natural Supreme Sage,\nTo rescue those lost in the dark paths,\nAnd descend Your light to illuminate.\n\nWe sincerely repent the torments of the Boiling Cauldron Hell.\nWe pity the suffering of the dark realms,\nWhere boiling cauldrons surge like waves.\nThe tormented souls are seared and dissolved,\nTheir flesh and bones reduced to molten ruin.\n\nWe pray to the Supreme Sage of Non-Doing,\nTo widely open the Great Pardon,\nAnd forgive all transgressions.\nThe Wheel Lamp’s radiance returns to illuminate the Nine Abysses,\nAnd grants them swift passage to the realm of joyous ease.\n\n*With the inconceivable merit and power.*\n\n**Fifth Invocation: The Path of Worldly Burden-Binding Torment (Shēnlèi Kǔhún Mén)**\n*To the Venerable Lord of the Five Paths, Fifth Torment: The Gate of Torment Bound by Worldly Burdens*\n\nEngaged in worldly affairs,\nFluctuating between honor and humiliation,\nThe heart is enslaved by cares,\nAnd the spirit suffers torment.\nAfter death, one endures the torments of the Waves of the Black River Hell.\n\nNow, the officiant [name] lights this divine lamp,\nIn memorial for the departed spirit and form of [name],\nTo ascend to the Heavenly Realm.\n\nWe humbly pray to the Most High and Most Venerable Sage,\nAnd the Supreme Emperor of the Supreme Emperor,\nTo extend Your great virtue and power,\nAnd rescue those sunk in darkness.\n\nWe sincerely repent the torments of the Waves of the Black River.\nWe return our faith to the Three Purity and Three Realms above,\nAnd to the Compassionate Savior of the Five Paths who responds to prayers.\n\nMay the Dragon’s return journey descend upon the Mountain of the Black River,\nAnd liberate the tormented souls from the Three Realms and Five Torments.\n\nAll cold waves of filth and turbid surges\nTransform into pure, sweet dew.\n\nThis night, through Dao’s power, we earnestly cultivate—\nThe lamp’s light universally illuminates, breaking the depths below.\n\nWith immeasurable, inconceivable virtue/power,\nThe Wheel-Turning Holy Sovereign, Heavenly Venerable One,\nRecites the sutra,\nExpounds the teachings,\nChants the merits and dedicates them.\n\nWe humbly hear the Heavenly Venerable’s sacred power,\nRescuing and liberating all beings;\nThe Original Beginning’s sacred scriptures,\nAble to dissolve all sins.\n\nPreviously, we lit the Five Torments and Three Realms Wheel of Light,\nRecited true scriptures,\nOffered horses and money in devotion—\nEndless virtuous causes.\n\nPresented by the officiant [name] to honor the Netherworld authorities,\nWe pray for their grace and command,\nTo elevate the departed spirit and form of [name],\nTo ascend to the Heavenly Realm above,\nTo benefit the lonely and bereaved below,\nAnd together attain the realm of birth.\n\nWe humbly pray that lamp may illuminate lamp,\nThat prison may cease its torment,\nTo swiftly ascend to the Heaven above the heavens,\nAnd not fall into the earth below the earth,\nRelying on Dao’s power,\nAs the supreme auspicious connection.\nRecite:\n\n*\"The Great Unity Savior of Suffering, Heavenly Venerable One,\nWith boundless, inconceivable virtue/power.\"*\n\nThe **Yellow Banner Five Torments Wheel of Light Rites** are
