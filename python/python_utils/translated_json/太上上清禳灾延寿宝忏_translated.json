  "full_translation": "*The Supreme Purity Precious Repentance for Eliminating Disasters and Prolonging Life*\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Purity Precious Repentance for Eliminating Disasters and Prolonging Life*\nOne scroll.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Weiyi* Category.\n\n---\n\nThe Most High of Supreme Purity states:\nIf there are faithful men or faithful women who suffer from yearly calamities or monthly misfortunes, lingering illnesses, entanglements with government offices, slanderous tongues, false accusations, or obscure injustices they cannot clarify; if they are oppressed, stagnant, and obstructed, their desires unfulfilled, their undertakings thwarted, their plans unrealized—then on the day of their own life’s destiny, the *jiazi* day, the *gengshen* day, the Three Origin days, the eight seasonal festivals, or the three *qi* days of each month, or on the distant memorial days of their ancestors or parents, they should arrange the sacred images of the Three Pure Ones, offering seasonal fruits, incense, flowers, banners, and lamps in worship. They should personally perform the rites and recite this repentance text.\n\nAlternatively, they may invite Daoist priests to perform the repentance and expiatory rites, speaking thus:\n*\"This repentant disciple [Name], prostrate, acknowledges that since birth I have dwelled in the world of men, long residing in the Central Realm, bearing the grace of Heaven and Earth’s nurturance, abiding beneath the illumination of the sun and moon. Yet perhaps my fate has clashed with opposing forces, my fortune aligned with the *Kuigang*; the year’s influence has bound me in the celestial net and earthly snare, or malevolent stars have secretly entwined my destiny. Perhaps in construction or burial, in building a house or breaking ground; or in managing affairs, crafting objects, moving, or traveling, I have failed to avoid forbidden directions and offended the divine killers.\"*\n\nOr perhaps in hosting gatherings and receptions, I failed to choose auspicious dates, altering plans and actions, and mistakenly acted on inauspicious days. Or in breaking the Dipper’s alignment through trade, I sowed discord among kin and friends. Or I obstructed the virtuous Way, misinterpreted right discourse, provoked others’ resentment, and incurred their curses; I formed alliances with the powerful, entrapped the loyal and good, relied on my high position to oppress the lowly and weak, seized others’ treasures without regard for benevolence and righteousness. Thus, I stirred human hearts to resentment and slander, and ghosts awaited the chance to bring misfortune; I diminished others’ fortune and blessings, shortened their lifespans, so that offenses accumulated in the unseen realm, ultimately manifesting as retribution in this world, bringing calamity upon nine generations of ancestors and extending suffering to descendants.\n\nNow, before the sacred presences, I repent all these transgressions in full. With bowed head and utmost sincerity, I prostrate and take refuge, offering reverent homage to the universally compassionate and world-protecting honored titles of the Most High:\n\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the True Realm of the Most High,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Containing Vastness and Embracing Simplicity,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Prolonging Life and Increasing Destiny,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Dispelling Disasters and Quelling Adversities,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Kindness and Loving Compassion,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Nurturing Life and Transforming Growth,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Embracing the Origin and Harmonizing Principles,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Purple Palace and Flourishing Virtue,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Supporting and Assisting the Primordial,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Vast Bestowal and Great Discernment,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Communing with Spirits and Embracing Vastness,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Mechanism and Responding to Stimuli,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Wisdom and Perfect Illumination,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Illuminating the True and Nurturing the Vast,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Clarity and Profound Forgiveness,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Radiant Sovereignty and Wondrous Stillness,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Perfected Ruling the Summit,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Roaming the Eight Sceneries,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Embracing and Harmonizing Myriad Virtues,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Three Sovereigns Delivering the World,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifesting Transformation and Revealing the Dao,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Revering the True and Abiding in the World,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Talismans and Golden Registers,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Chapters and Feathered Canopies,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Gazing Afar and Proliferating Blessings,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Perfected One of Dispelling Disasters and Prolonging Life,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Perfected One of Pardoning Transgressions and Bestowing Blessings.\n\nThis disciple, relying on the true scriptures, reverently pays homage to the Most High Perfected Ones, earnestly praying with utmost sincerity, wholeheartedly repenting.\n\nSince time without beginning, I may have served as an official or functionary, wielding the state’s authority, issuing decrees and administering punishments. I wantonly abused power, disregarded right principles, defrauded the public and perverted the law, disrupted order and discipline, concealed worthy and enlightened individuals, and allied with treacherous factions. Above, I obstructed the celestial hearing; below, I suppressed the people’s voices. Loyal admonitions and virtuous ways could not reach their destination; the suffering of the oppressed found no redress. I accepted bribes and distorted justice, indulged cunning clerks, and harmed the good and innocent. I sold high and bought low, exploited the common people, damaged public interests for private gain, made no distinction between good and evil, wantonly meted out punishments and neglected governance, failed to discern right from wrong, ignored hardship and suffering, and paid no heed to hunger and thirst. For all these past deeds, I am destined to fall into hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When that suffering ends, I may be reborn as a hungry ghost or an animal, cycling through birth and death for hundreds of thousands of kalpas. When that retribution is exhausted, I may return to this world, yet due to past deeds, I still suffer residual misfortunes.\n\nSince time without beginning, I may have served as a shaman or diviner, or as a physician or fortune-teller, falsely invoking malevolent spirits to fraudulently acquire wealth. I concocted poisonous medicines, aggravated illnesses, practiced divination, and performed curses to gods and spirits, depleting others’ resources for my own benefit. For all these past deeds, I am destined to fall into hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When that suffering ends, I may be reborn as a hungry ghost or an animal, cycling through birth and death for hundreds of thousands of kalpas. When that retribution is exhausted, I may return to this world, yet due to past deeds, I still suffer residual misfortunes.\n\nSince time without beginning, I may have dwelled in the marketplace, devoted to commerce, engaging in trade and barter, wholly abandoning benevolence and righteousness to deceive and profit. I mixed the coarse with the refined, embellished the false to confuse the genuine, misled others in their use, employed large scales and small measures, and committed countless acts driven solely by greed, ever harboring deceit and fraud. For all these past deeds, I am destined to fall into hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When that suffering ends, I may be reborn as a hungry ghost or an animal, cycling through birth and death for hundreds of thousands of kalpas. When that retribution is exhausted, I may return to this world, yet due to past deeds, I still suffer residual misfortunes.\n\nSince time without beginning, I have failed to recognize the true Way, unable to distinguish the true from the false, coveting beauty and wealth, despising poverty and pursuing riches, chasing fame and profit, neglecting humility and benevolence. I associated with the frivolous and arrogant, failed to honor my parents’ wishes, forgot righteousness at the sight of profit, insulted sages and disdained the worthy. Perhaps I exposed my body naked to the empty sky, urinated facing the sun, moon, and stars, cursed heaven and earth, complained of cold and heat, pointed at rainbows, spat at shooting stars, made vows and curses, or reviled gods and spirits. For all these past deeds, I am destined to fall into hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When that suffering ends, I may be reborn as a hungry ghost or an animal, cycling through birth and death for hundreds of thousands of kalpas. When that retribution is exhausted, I may return to this world, yet due to past deeds, I still suffer residual misfortunes.\n\nNow, before the sacred presences, I repent all these transgressions in full. I take refuge and offer reverent homage to the universally compassionate and world-protecting honored titles of the Most High:\n\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Wondrous Liberation Realm,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Light,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Embracing Myriad Beings,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Subduing Demons and Shielding from Defilement,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Protection,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Virtue and Self-Mastery,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Deliverance.\n\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Transformation,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Joy,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Realm of Serene Joy,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Bestowing Virtue and Transforming through the Dao,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Preserving the Dao in Supreme Purity,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Realm Adorned in Purity,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Purple Clarity Wondrous Realm,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Joyfully Nurturing Virtue,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Upholding Rectitude and Practicing the Dao,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Transforming Beings,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Benefiting Beings,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Virtue’s Light Ever Radiant,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy Embracing Myriad Forms,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Protecting and Upholding the Void Realm,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Universally Aiding Sentient Beings,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Perfected of Great Compassion and Great Kindness,\nI take refuge and offer reverent homage to the Perfected Who Delivers from Suffering and Transcends Calamity.\n\nThis disciple, so-and-so, relying upon the harmony of the true, reverently worships the Supreme Perfected, earnestly praying with utmost sincerity, wholeheartedly repenting.\n\nI reflect upon myself: born of humble and lowly origin, endowed with an ignorant and obstinate nature, yet having received great favor, I was granted access to the true teaching. My merits fall short by the slightest measure, while my transgressions accumulate like mountains.\n\nNow, with sincerity laid bare, I prostrate myself before the exalted sages, baring my heart and exposing my innermost being, confessing my sins and acknowledging my foremost faults, humbly beseeching your compassionate regard.\n\nMay a small measure of your numinous grace turn toward me, pardoning the thousand wrongs of the past;\nMay your merciful kindness be bestowed, granting a hundred blessings in the days to come.\nMay I long abide beneath the shelter of the Dao, my family enjoying peace and prosperity,\nMay my nine generations of ancestors ascend to higher realms,\nMay all my wishes be harmoniously fulfilled,\nMay all my prayers be answered as sought,\nIn all my movements and stillness, truly relying upon your life-giving power.\n\nThis disciple, with utmost sincerity and earnest supplication, offers this prayer.\n\nThe *Precious Repentance for Averting Disaster and Prolonging Life* of the Supreme Highest Clarity is now complete.",
