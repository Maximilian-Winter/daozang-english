  "full_translation": "**Questions and Answers on the Great Elixir**\n\n*Title:* *Questions and Answers on the Great Elixir*. Author unknown, approximately from the Northern and Southern Dynasties or Tang period. Its content largely aligns with *The Jade Brick of Great Clarity*. One scroll. Source of the base text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Divine Metaphysics*, *Category of Various Arts*.\n\n**Questions and Answers on the Great Elixir**\n\nThe Jin dynasty Daoist Zheng Siyuan transmitted this to his closed-door disciple Ge Hong, styled Zhichuan, known as the Master Who Embraces Simplicity.\n\nBowing deeply to my revered teacher, I, Hong, humbly submit: I consider the origin of human life to be the union of yin essence and yang essence. Yang essence establishes the hun-soul, yin essence forms the po-soul; when the two essences interact, spirit and clarity arise. The spirit acts through the body, and the body is born of the spirit. When the spirit departs, the body perishes as well. Dare I ask, Master: Can the spirit be preserved? Can the body be prolonged?\n\nThe Master replied: The spirit is preserved through the Dao, the body is prolonged through defense.\n\nHong further inquired: What is the essence of the Dao and defense?\n\nThe Master said: The Dao is hidden and nameless; defense is manifest and substantive. With substance, defense can be practiced; without name, the Dao can be accomplished. When the Dao is accomplished, the spirit is naturally preserved.\n\nHong said: The Dao is hidden and nameless, existing beyond form; arts of defense are manifest and substantive, rooted in the hub. I humbly beseech you, Master, to deign to reveal their mysteries.\n\nThe Master said: Defense involves bending and stretching, embryonic breathing, swallowing saliva, controlling the woman to return essence, and ingesting cinnabar to preserve the body. Beyond these, I have not heard.\n\nHong said: I have already received your instruction on returning essence. As for the art of preserving the body, I beg you to further enlighten me.\n\nThe Master said: Take the essence of metal and the fluid of stone, unite them as husband and wife, array them as hun and po. In a single undifferentiated state, the two essences stir and excite. The river chariot inverts its load, the crucible awaits its moment. The alchemical furnace blazes with fierce fire, flames roaring and crackling. Before smoke turns black, before flames glow azure—like storing a whirlwind, like concealing thunder—Maiden’s qi wanes, Infant’s voice falls silent. Piercing the Two Modes, adorning the Four Walls, after some time, like a horse galloping a post station, it seems to die, then suddenly transforms. Evil is cast out, good is embraced; emotions revert, nature is altered. Purple radiance penetrates within, red brilliance shines without—illuminating like fire, moistening like blood drops. This is called the \"Inner Return,\" which transcends great calamity. Withdraw and conceal it; its consumption requires no teaching. Mist disperses through the five viscera, rivers flow through the hundred channels. Bones transform into metal and stone, complexion reverts to jade-like luster. Yang virtue spreads, yin merit accumulates. Names are recorded in the Southern Palace, registers are stricken in the Northern Emperor’s realm. This is the foundation of the Dao, the chief of immortality. Do not transmit it to the unworthy, lest you incur divine censure.\n\nHe further said: Though heaven and earth are vast, compared to the body, they are small. Who of shallow understanding can comprehend the refinement of the most subtle to form the elixir? Why worry as if something were lacking? When qi is paired, harmony ensues; when the body is solitary, sorrow arises. Harmony extends life; sorrow hastens death. Once the mandate is severed, it is difficult to restore. Yet principle may be sought through intention, and intention lies beyond words. Let me attempt to explain:\n\nWhat is called the Dao is the interplay of one yin and one yang; what is called the elixir is the union of one metal and one stone. Stone rides yang and is hot; metal rides yin and is cold. In their ingestion, they take strong yang to subdue yin. In their effects, they strengthen the hun and soften the po. Like water flowing toward moisture, like fire moving toward dryness—this is their inevitable tendency, their principle observable.\n\nI humbly hope, Master, that you will permit further inquiry.\n\nThe Master said: Your words, disciple, are of refined meaning and worthy of adoption. When yang reaches its end, yin attains its extreme. The division of *hai* governs the four seasons, circulating without cease. Heaven and earth interact, sun and moon conjoin—how can these be omitted? Let me briefly outline the essentials.\n\nMoreover, the fluid of stone hides in the unseen, the essence of metal resides in mountains. The solitary transformation of august yin surely awaits the depths of the Nine Netherworlds. How much better for the gentleman to seek good transmission, to obtain the virtuous consort? Then yin and yang attain balance, hun and po are without excess.\n\nAlas! The lives of worldly people are like lightning, pointing to mulberry fields turned to seas. These words align with the secrets of immortality; my Dao is transmitted to the true master.\n\nHong said: My reckless words coincidentally accord with true principle. As for refining the fluid of stone, what is its method?\n\nThe Master said: Things have their forms, can be great and enduring. Gather them before the silkworm’s feeding, use them after fire’s transformation. When molten bronze naturally stops and drips down, split the cauldron to reveal its emptiness and receive it. The sun and moon revolve; five cycles await their moments. Strike the bellows swiftly, so the golden liquid does not escape. Douse it with water, and it moves from being to non-being; warm it with fire, and it moves from non-being to being. Apply white powder to entrust its numen, briefly revive the yellow to congeal the ugly. Continuously transform and refine; spirit gallops, ghosts hasten. Grasp and direct the qi with intention, reverse and renew decay. Metal? Stone? Heavenly years, earthly longevity. The mystery lies in the text; the secret is in the mouth.\n\n*The Song of the Perfected of Great Clarity* says:\n*\"Illuminating one, penetrating myriad miles—*\n*All are immortals of the upper realms.*\n*Descending to gather and refine,*\n*Not merely encountered by worldly people.*\n*All are born in the south,*\n*Near the sun, accumulating qi over years.*\n*After four thousand three hundred twenty years,*\n*Natural Returning Elixir is born—known to immortals of old.*\n*Now, using three years of fire,*\n*We emulate the qi of nature.*\n*Today’s immortals guard their teachings,*\n*But fire-timing follows the rhythm of weights and measures,*\n*Charcoal counts correspond to hexagrams and trigrams,*\n*Employing Qian and Kun in practice.*\n*Daily fire-timing naturally aligns.*\n*One line generates two and a half days,*\n*Two lines generate five days, sixty hours.*\n*One month has three hundred sixty hours,*\n*Twelve months make a year,*\n*Totaling four thousand three hundred twenty hours—*\n*One hour represents four thousand three hundred twenty years of natural qi.*\n*From the Yellow Sprout’s first cycle,*\n*Dragon and Tiger are drawn forth.*\n*From Tiger, from Dragon,*\n*In one year, the body becomes like charcoal.*\n*After another year,*\n*Brilliantly, the Returning Elixir is formed.\"*\n\nAll arises from the intercourse of yin and yang,\ntheir transformations and numinous transmutations—\nbeyond human reckoning, called divine and wondrous.\n\nOne day and night of firing emulates one celestial revolution.\nThrough the four seasons’ generation and completion,\nyin and yang harmonize in measure,\nfollowing the Dao of nature.\nWithdrawal and addition, blending and union,\nthe fire-timing aligns with the tally.\n\nWithout a master’s transmission,\nrelying solely on textual study,\none will never grasp the principle—\nindeed, no attainment is possible.\nYet those who persevere with unwavering resolve\nshall surely encounter a teacher and receive the oral instructions.\n\n*Inscribed on the ancient stone wall.*\n\n*End of the Dialogues on the Great Elixir.*",
