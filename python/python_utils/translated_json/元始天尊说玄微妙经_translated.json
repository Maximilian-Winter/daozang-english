  "full_translation": "*The Venerable Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning Expounds the Sutra of the Mysterious and Subtle*\n\nThe Dao speaks: To fathom the subtlety of the mysterious and subtle, one must cultivate stillness of mind and practice the Dao in accordance with the seasons. On the vernal equinox, at midnight, rise and sit facing east. With eyes closed, visualize the Three Ones within the Three Palaces of your body, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven in total, with you at the center. Together, you all ride the mist of purple qi and ascend to the Yang Brightness Star of the Northern Dipper. The Yang Brightness Star is the eastern spirit of the Northern Dipper. There, visualize entering the star’s center and sitting within it. Swallow the purple qi thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally perceive the Eastern Supreme Palace of the Yang Brightness Star, where the Azure Mystery Youth dwells, bestowing upon you the True Light.\n\nFirst, visualize beneath the Northern Dipper a purple qi as vast as a bowstring, descending straight before you, and only then visualize the Three Ones. Master Zhou’s oral instructions state: Visualize the seven figures beneath the seven stars of the Dipper, ascending together to the Yang Brightness Star in a formation like wild geese, with you at the center. \"Beneath the stars\" means the Dipper’s bowl covers your head, its handle pointing forward. Swallowing the purple qi thirty times means visualizing the purple qi and drawing it in. Also imagine the Three Ones and Three Ministers swallowing it simultaneously. After swallowing, further visualize the seven figures riding the purple qi, descending from the void, and returning to your Three Palaces. After a long while, recite this prayer from the heart:\n\n*\"Three Venerable Perfected Ones, Supreme Mysterious Lofty Spirits,*\n*Yang Brightness governs spring, myriad youths open the gates;*\n*Cinnabar Prime governs summer, vermilion and purple merge in mist;*\n*Yin Essence governs autumn, celestial might arrays six ranks;*\n*North Culmen governs winter, all evil and treachery are blocked.*\n*Five Earths hold the ren, the celestial passes of wu and ji,*\n*All they shatter is destroyed, all they face remains unharmed.*\n*Refine my seven po, harmonize my three hun,*\n*Vitalize my five viscera, let me attain the True.*\n*Ascend to soar in the Upper Clarity, float through the Seven Origins’ radiance,*\n*Abide in longevity and compliance, command the thousand spirits with a whistle.\"*\n\nThis may also be practiced while lying down. The same incantation applies to all four seasonal nodes.\n\nOn the summer solstice, at midnight, rise and sit facing south. With eyes closed, visualize the Three Ones within the Three Palaces of your body, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven in total, with you at the center. Together, you all ride the mist of purple qi and ascend to the Cinnabar Prime Star of the Northern Dipper. The Cinnabar Prime Star is the southern spirit of the Northern Dipper. There, visualize entering the star and sitting within it. Swallow the purple qi thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally perceive the Southern Culmen Supreme Palace of the Cinnabar Prime Star, where the Vermilion Yang Numinous Consort dwells, bestowing upon you the Crimson Script and Treasure Texts.\n\nOn the autumnal equinox, at midnight, rise and sit facing west. With eyes closed, visualize the Three Ones within the Three Palaces of your body, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven in total, with you at the center. Together, you all ride the mist of purple qi and ascend to the Yin Essence Star of the Northern Dipper. The Yin Essence Star is [text incomplete, missing approximately 470 characters].\n\n[...] The eight seasonal nodes are to be determined by consulting the calendar. These eight nodes mark the correct degrees of the Jade Armillary, the days when the myriad perfected, numinous immortals, and divine spirits gather in audience. The Northern Thearch’s natural method holds that within the lunar cycle, the days when the three luminaries’ qi align are also most auspicious. It is fitting to cultivate the Dao on these days.\n\nIn synthesis, I follow the One alone. Foreign lands reckon the first day of the month as *jian*, the second as *chu*, and so on in sequence. This may be used where no calendar is available in remote regions. The Xiongnu kingdom takes the first day of the first month as *jiayin*, with the six *jia* days cycling continuously. Their months alternate as follows: first month long, second month long, third month short, fourth month long, fifth month short, sixth month long, seventh month short, eighth month long, ninth month short, tenth month long, eleventh month short, twelfth month long. Those dwelling in remote forests or distant, inaccessible places should also follow this reckoning.\n\nOn *jian* days, or the first day of the month, at dawn, visualize the Three Ones emerging from your Three Palaces and sitting before you. Then rise from the heart and bow twice, as if seeing them faintly. Recite this prayer from the heart: [...]\n\nThe Heavenly Honored Three Emperors guard the Gate of my life,\nroaming the Void within,\nwhere the six qi divide in mystery,\nnurturing my five spirits,\nrectifying my three hun-souls,\nso the five viscera generate of themselves,\nand I attain long life and ascend as a flying immortal.\n\nWhen finished, again visualize them returning from the Void into the Three Palaces.\nAfter a long while, swallow saliva thirty times.\nPerform this ten times, and at night you will dream of the Three Ones and the Three Ministers.\nOr you may dream of white crows, white cranes,\nwhite tigers, or objects of gold and jade—\nall are manifestations and signs of the Three Ones’ transformations.\nIf you maintain this practice without negligence,\nthe visions will appear,\nand you will gradually see them face to face.\n\nOn every *chu* day at midnight,\nrise in secret and face north,\ngazing at the forms within the seven stars of the Northern Dipper.\nVisualize the Three Ones descending from the Auxiliary Star\nand entering your Three Palaces.\nWhen this is complete, return to bed and meditate quietly,\nimagining them as if faintly seen.\nThen softly recite this prayer:\n\nGreat Heavenly Auxiliary,\nwhere the Three Emperors roam,\nthe Three Ministers support my bones,\nuniting with the Perfected,\ndescending into my body,\nsettling in tranquil primal seat,\nexhaling essence to bathe my form,\nso hun and po harmonize and moisten,\nthat I may ascend as a flying immortal,\ntraveling the clouds in floating roam.\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva twenty-seven times.\nDo this once on each *chu* day of the month.\n\nOn every *kai* day at midnight,\nrise and sit facing east,\nremove your headwrap,\nor let your hair loose,\nthen comb and bind it again,\ntaking care to tie it securely.\nSoftly recite this invocation:\n\nSupreme Three Perfected,\nDivine Infant within the Real,\nhair unbound to open the mist,\nascending to connect with Heavenly Terrace,\nmud-pill solidified and firm,\nmoving in time with Heaven,\nthat I may fly as an immortal,\ntraversing the towers of the Wu Terrace.\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva nineteen times,\nthen replace your headwrap and return to bed.\nWith focused mind, visualize the Three Ones and Three Ministers\neach settled in their palaces,\nthe Emperor and his ministers seated facing one another.\nVisualize the Three Ones exhaling qi thirty times within their palaces—\nwhen you do this, exhale qi yourself thirty times as well.\nExhaling qi means the method of opening the mouth and releasing breath.\nAt that time, you will feel your body grow warm,\na sign of harmonized spirit and congealed hun-soul.\nIn all visualizations, close your eyes slightly\nand inwardly gaze upon the divine palace.\nThe Dao of visualizing the One\ncauses the Supreme Three Primordial qi to appear within the Three Palaces.\nThe Three Primordials are the three faint hues of purple, azure, and crimson—\npurple above.\nThen visualize and guard the Three Ones within them,\nand imagine the Jade Palace of the Northern Culmen’s Purple Gate,\nwhere the celestial officials are arrayed in order.\nEnvision yourself seated before the Emperor,\nand whatever you seek, bow in your heart.\nThe Supreme is the Shangqing;\nthe Emperor of Shangqing is the most exalted.\nThe Northern Culmen’s Purple Chamber is the Emperor’s chamber.\nAlso visualize your Three Ones\ndiscussing with the Emperor the Dao of flying immortality and eternal life.\n\nWhenever partaking of a grand feast,\nalways rectify your mind and visualize the One,\nimagining the One partaking of the food first,\nthen you may eat.\nIf you do this consistently,\nperverse qi will retreat far away,\nand true qi will come forward.\nAfter eating, recite this prayer in your heart:\n\nThe hundred grains enter the stomach,\nuniting with spirit and qi,\nfilling and replenishing blood and fluids,\nthe corpse-demons fall away,\nto live as long as Heaven and Earth,\nascending to the Golden Gates,\ncommanding the Six Dings,\nwith divine youths attending and guarding.\n\nThe method of guarding the One:\non *jia-wu*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-yin* days at midnight,\nsweep and purify a quiet chamber’s courtyard,\nlay out a mat one *zhang* square,\nburn incense and bow twice facing north—\nthis may also be done as a mental bow.\nThen gaze upward at the seven stars of the Northern Dipper,\nvisualizing purple qi emerging from the Dipper\nand entering the Three Palaces within your body.\nFacing north, clasp your hands over your knees,\nand visualize the Three Ones, Three Ministers, and yourself\nall riding the purple qi to ascend to the Great Ultimate.\nThe Great Ultimate is a star.\nLet your body and form fade away,\nas if in a trance like ascending to Heaven—\nthis brings the immortal Dao near.\nThe immortals call this the Great Stillness.\nOn overcast or rainy days,\nyou may perform this visualization on your bed,\nor prepare a platform in a quiet place,\none *zhang* square,\nenclosed by a fence several *chi* high.\nOn the appointed day, always cultivate this—\nthis is the Dao of the Great Stillness.\n\nThe Dao of guarding the One:\nalways observe the time of the moon’s first appearance,\nface the moon and bow twice,\nthen softly recite this prayer:\n\nMysterious Essence of the Great Yin,\nLady of the Radiant Moon,\nnewly born flowing light,\nilluminating my Three Palaces,\nthat I may fly as an immortal above,\nsoaring freely through the eight directions,\nwherever I turn, wherever I wish,\nall shall be within fortune’s embrace.\n\nThe Dao of guarding the One:\nalways visualize the Northern Dipper hovering above your head,\nits handle pointing forward—\nthis is the essential secret to repel all perverse influences\nand extinguish inauspicious qi.\n\nWhen guarding the One,\navoid eating the five pungent vegetables and all meat,\nand do not enter the home of a woman who has recently given birth.\nOn *jia-zi* days, also avoid seeing drunkards\nand all foul or putrid things—\nkeep your distance and be cautious,\ndismissing all doubts without hesitation.\nDo not hold infants—\nonly your own child is permitted.\nDo not share clothing, shoes, beds, or mats with others—\nonly when guarding the One.\nCultivating the real, stilling the spirit,\nfocusing on the Dao to summon the numinous—\nall these require separate spaces,\nnot merely this one practice.\n\nThe Later Sage, Lord Emperor of the Golden Gates,\nonce received the *Scripture of the Three Primordial Ones of the Three Origins*,\nthe *True Talisman of the Lord Emperor of the Great Ultimate*,\nthe *Scripture of the Five Dippers’ True One*,\nand the *Precious Chapters of the Lord Emperor of the Great Ultimate*—\nfour methods in all,\nwhich he later transmitted to the immortal Juanzi.\nJuanzi, while fishing in the river, caught a fish\nand upon cutting it open, found a green jade casket.\nOpening it, he discovered two talismans and two scriptural methods—\nthis was it.\n\nThis is the supreme Dao of the Inner Concealed Earthly Perfected,\nby which one may attend banquets in the Shangqing,\nwander and gaze upon the Great Ultimate,\nsoar and roam Mount Kongtong,\nrest and sleep on Mount Kunlun.\n\nAccording to the *Illuminating Regulations of the Four Poles*,\nthe method of the *Life-Bestowing Talisman of Radiant Light*:\nall those who possess the supreme scriptures of the Earthly Perfected\nmust observe transmission time limits,\nswear oaths before the Three Officials,\npresent silk and blood at the altar,\nand make covenants with blood and leather\nbefore receiving the transmission.\nThe recipient must purify themselves for a hundred days,\nor fifty, thirty, twenty-one, ten, or seven days.\nOnly those who can be taught—\nthose of sincere heart and true faith—\nshould be transmitted the method of guarding the Three Origins’ Perfected,\nusing the talismans of the Two Emperors,\nand ascending the Dao of the Five Dippers.\nThis is the supreme Dao of the Earthly Perfected.\n\nThe method allows transmission to one person every forty years,\nand no more than ten people in four hundred years.\nIf no suitable person is found,\nwrite a copy on white silk,\nseal it, and deposit it in a hidden cave within the Five Marchmounts.\nEvery forty years, write another copy\nand seal it in the Five Marchmounts.\nThe Five Marchmounts are gathered in one mountain—\nthey need not be evenly distributed across five peaks,\nbut rather placed in the nearest suitable location.\nIf no marchmount is nearby,\nfamous mountains will suffice—\nsuch as Mount Baodu in the north,\nMount Difei in the west,\nMount Luofu and Mount Taihe in the south,\nMount Tiantai and Mount Kuohuo in the east—\nthese and others are all famous mountains.\n\nIf ten suitable people are found within four hundred years,\nthey may be transmitted the method;\nbeyond that time, it may no longer be revealed.\nThose who violate the regulations, leak the secrets,\nor fail to follow the proper methods\nwill be sent to the Water Officials,\nto suffer the trials of the Wind Blade,\nand their descendants will meet with calamity and extinction.\n\nThe blood oaths of the fragile covenants\nwere received by the Green Lad,\nwho revealed them to later students\nas enduring standards and measures.\n\nShould one receive the *Scripture of the Three Primordials and the True Unity*, one must seek a master of the Dao who is bound by fragile covenants, offering eighty-seven feet of plain white silk and three pairs of silver rings. (For a single copy, twenty-nine feet of white silk and one pair of silver rings suffice. The above is the total sum.) Alternatively, three jade tablets may be used in place of the oath sworn by cutting leather to seal against leaks. For the *Scripture of the Supreme Five Dipper True Unity*, one must seek a master who holds the scripture, presenting forty feet of purple inscribed silk and two pairs of gold rings, substituting for the blood-oath contracts that risk decay and disclosure. For the *True Talismans of the Great Ultimate*, one must seek a master who holds the talismans, offering twenty feet of vermilion silk. For the *Precious Chart Talismans of the Great Ultimate*, one must seek a master of the scripture and charts, presenting twenty feet of azure silk, equivalent to the vow made upon ascending the altar and shearing one’s hair—a pledge binding until death. Those who receive these must await the depths of forests, marshes, mountains, and wilds, and may not recklessly employ them for private gain. Should one violate and fail to uphold them, the statutes of severance and erasure shall apply, and the transgressor shall perish, cast into the Three Springs. Transmission from father to son must likewise adhere to the fragile covenants as prescribed. All transmissions are conducted between master and disciple, thereby honoring the root and foundation and making clear the gravity of Heaven’s sincerity. Yet this is not the sole purpose; rather, it is to ensure that the methods of instruction have a proper beginning. Truly, unless one is predestined with immortal bones and the mysterious registers, one shall never even hear or glimpse the wondrous Dao of the True Unity.\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning concluded his discourse on the *Subtle and Wondrous Scripture*. #1 (Note: The missing text here may be referenced in the *Secret Instructions of the Supreme Clarity Golden Watchtower Lord on the Five Dipper and Three Unity Diagram*.)",

      "translated_text": "On every *kai* day at midnight,\nrise and sit facing east,\nremove your headwrap,\nor let your hair loose,\nthen comb and bind it again,\ntaking care to tie it securely.\nSoftly recite this invocation:\n\nSupreme Three Perfected,\nDivine Infant within the Real,\nhair unbound to open the mist,\nascending to connect with Heavenly Terrace,\nmud-pill solidified and firm,\nmoving in time with Heaven,\nthat I may fly as an immortal,\ntraversing the towers of the Wu Terrace.\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva nineteen times,\nthen replace your headwrap and return to bed.\nWith focused mind, visualize the Three Ones and Three Ministers\neach settled in their palaces,\nthe Emperor and his ministers seated facing one another.\nVisualize the Three Ones exhaling qi thirty times within their palaces—\nwhen you do this, exhale qi yourself thirty times as well.\nExhaling qi means the method of opening the mouth and releasing breath.\nAt that time, you will feel your body grow warm,\na sign of harmonized spirit and congealed hun-soul.\nIn all visualizations, close your eyes slightly\nand inwardly gaze upon the divine palace.\nThe Dao of visualizing the One\ncauses the Supreme Three Primordial qi to appear within the Three Palaces.\nThe Three Primordials are the three faint hues of purple, azure, and crimson—\npurple above.\nThen visualize and guard the Three Ones within them,\nand imagine the Jade Palace of the Northern Culmen’s Purple Gate,\nwhere the celestial officials are arrayed in order.\nEnvision yourself seated before the Emperor,\nand whatever you seek, bow in your heart.\nThe Supreme is the Shangqing;\nthe Emperor of Shangqing is the most exalted.\nThe Northern Culmen’s Purple Chamber is the Emperor’s chamber.\nAlso visualize your Three Ones\ndiscussing with the Emperor the Dao of flying immortality and eternal life.\n\nWhenever partaking of a grand feast,\nalways rectify your mind and visualize the One,\nimagining the One partaking of the food first,\nthen you may eat.\nIf you do this consistently,\nperverse qi will retreat far away,\nand true qi will come forward.\nAfter eating, recite this prayer in your heart:\n\nThe hundred grains enter the stomach,\nuniting with spirit and qi,\nfilling and replenishing blood and fluids,\nthe corpse-demons fall away,\nto live as long as Heaven and Earth,\nascending to the Golden Gates,\ncommanding the Six Dings,\nwith divine youths attending and guarding.\n\nThe method of guarding the One:\non *jia-wu*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-yin* days at midnight,\nsweep and purify a quiet chamber’s courtyard,\nlay out a mat one *zhang* square,\nburn incense and bow twice facing north—\nthis may also be done as a mental bow.\nThen gaze upward at the seven stars of the Northern Dipper,\nvisualizing purple qi emerging from the Dipper\nand entering the Three Palaces within your body.\nFacing north, clasp your hands over your knees,\nand visualize the Three Ones, Three Ministers, and yourself\nall riding the purple qi to ascend to the Great Ultimate.\nThe Great Ultimate is a star.\nLet your body and form fade away,\nas if in a trance like ascending to Heaven—\nthis brings the immortal Dao near.\nThe immortals call this the Great Stillness.\nOn overcast or rainy days,\nyou may perform this visualization on your bed,\nor prepare a platform in a quiet place,\none *zhang* square,\nenclosed by a fence several *chi* high.\nOn the appointed day, always cultivate this—\nthis is the Dao of the Great Stillness.\n\nThe Dao of guarding the One:\nalways observe the time of the moon’s first appearance,\nface the moon and bow twice,\nthen softly recite this prayer:\n\nMysterious Essence of the Great Yin,\nLady of the Radiant Moon,\nnewly born flowing light,\nilluminating my Three Palaces,\nthat I may fly as an immortal above,\nsoaring freely through the eight directions,\nwherever I turn, wherever I wish,\nall shall be within fortune’s embrace.\n\nThe Dao of guarding the One:\nalways visualize the Northern Dipper hovering above your head,\nits handle pointing forward—\nthis is the essential secret to repel all perverse influences\nand extinguish inauspicious qi.\n\nWhen guarding the One,\navoid eating the five pungent vegetables and all meat,\nand do not enter the home of a woman who has recently given birth.\nOn *jia-zi* days, also avoid seeing drunkards\nand all foul or putrid things—\nkeep your distance and be cautious,\ndismissing all doubts without hesitation.\nDo not hold infants—\nonly your own child is permitted.\nDo not share clothing, shoes, beds, or mats with others—\nonly when guarding the One.\nCultivating the real, stilling the spirit,\nfocusing on the Dao to summon the numinous—\nall these require separate spaces,\nnot merely this one practice.\n\nThe Later Sage, Lord Emperor of the Golden Gates,\nonce received the *Scripture of the Three Primordial Ones of the Three Origins*,\nthe *True Talisman of the Lord Emperor of the Great Ultimate*,\nthe *Scripture of the Five Dippers’ True One*,\nand the *Precious Chapters of the Lord Emperor of the Great Ultimate*—\nfour methods in all,\nwhich he later transmitted to the immortal Juanzi.\nJuanzi, while fishing in the river, caught a fish\nand upon cutting it open, found a green jade casket.\nOpening it, he discovered two talismans and two scriptural methods—\nthis was it.\n\nThis is the supreme Dao of the Inner Concealed Earthly Perfected,\nby which one may attend banquets in the Shangqing,\nwander and gaze upon the Great Ultimate,\nsoar and roam Mount Kongtong,\nrest and sleep on Mount Kunlun.\n\nAccording to the *Illuminating Regulations of the Four Poles*,\nthe method of the *Life-Bestowing Talisman of Radiant Light*:\nall those who possess the supreme scriptures of the Earthly Perfected\nmust observe transmission time limits,\nswear oaths before the Three Officials,\npresent silk and blood at the altar,\nand make covenants with blood and leather\nbefore receiving the transmission.\nThe recipient must purify themselves for a hundred days,\nor fifty, thirty, twenty-one, ten, or seven days.\nOnly those who can be taught—\nthose of sincere heart and true faith—\nshould be transmitted the method of guarding the Three Origins’ Perfected,\nusing the talismans of the Two Emperors,\nand ascending the Dao of the Five Dippers.\nThis is the supreme Dao of the Earthly Perfected.\n\nThe method allows transmission to one person every forty years,\nand no more than ten people in four hundred years.\nIf no suitable person is found,\nwrite a copy on white silk,\nseal it, and deposit it in a hidden cave within the Five Marchmounts.\nEvery forty years, write another copy\nand seal it in the Five Marchmounts.\nThe Five Marchmounts are gathered in one mountain—\nthey need not be evenly distributed across five peaks,\nbut rather placed in the nearest suitable location.\nIf no marchmount is nearby,\nfamous mountains will suffice—\nsuch as Mount Baodu in the north,\nMount Difei in the west,\nMount Luofu and Mount Taihe in the south,\nMount Tiantai and Mount Kuohuo in the east—\nthese and others are all famous mountains.\n\nIf ten suitable people are found within four hundred years,\nthey may be transmitted the method;\nbeyond that time, it may no longer be revealed.\nThose who violate the regulations, leak the secrets,\nor fail to follow the proper methods\nwill be sent to the Water Officials,\nto suffer the trials of the Wind Blade,\nand their descendants will meet with calamity and extinction.\n\nThe blood oaths of the fragile covenants\nwere received by the Green Lad,\nwho revealed them to later students\nas enduring standards and measures.",

      "translated_text": "Should one receive the *Scripture of the Three Primordials and the True Unity*, one must seek a master of the Dao who is bound by fragile covenants, offering eighty-seven feet of plain white silk and three pairs of silver rings. (For a single copy, twenty-nine feet of white silk and one pair of silver rings suffice. The above is the total sum.) Alternatively, three jade tablets may be used in place of the oath sworn by cutting leather to seal against leaks. For the *Scripture of the Supreme Five Dipper True Unity*, one must seek a master who holds the scripture, presenting forty feet of purple inscribed silk and two pairs of gold rings, substituting for the blood-oath contracts that risk decay and disclosure. For the *True Talismans of the Great Ultimate*, one must seek a master who holds the talismans, offering twenty feet of vermilion silk. For the *Precious Chart Talismans of the Great Ultimate*, one must seek a master of the scripture and charts, presenting twenty feet of azure silk, equivalent to the vow made upon ascending the altar and shearing one’s hair—a pledge binding until death. Those who receive these must await the depths of forests, marshes, mountains, and wilds, and may not recklessly employ them for private gain. Should one violate and fail to uphold them, the statutes of severance and erasure shall apply, and the transgressor shall perish, cast into the Three Springs. Transmission from father to son must likewise adhere to the fragile covenants as prescribed. All transmissions are conducted between master and disciple, thereby honoring the root and foundation and making clear the gravity of Heaven’s sincerity. Yet this is not the sole purpose; rather, it is to ensure that the methods of instruction have a proper beginning. Truly, unless one is predestined with immortal bones and the mysterious registers, one shall never even hear or glimpse the wondrous Dao of the True Unity.\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning concluded his discourse on the *Subtle and Wondrous Scripture*. #1 (Note: The missing text here may be referenced in the *Secret Instructions of the Supreme Clarity Golden Watchtower Lord on the Five Dipper and Three Unity Diagram*.)",
