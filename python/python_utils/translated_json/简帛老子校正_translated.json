  "full_translation": "**Guodian Laozi Collation**\n**A. Chu Bamboo Slip Version C**\nThe Great One gives birth to water,\nWater in turn assists the Great One, thus forming heaven.\nHeaven in turn assists the Great One, thus forming earth.\nHeaven and earth 〈mutually assist each other〉, thus forming the numinous luminants.\nThe numinous luminants mutually assist each other, thus forming yin and yang.\nYin and yang mutually assist each other, thus forming the four seasons.\nThe four seasons mutually assist each other, thus forming cold and heat.\nCold and heat mutually assist each other, thus forming dampness and dryness.\nDampness and dryness mutually assist each other, ceasing only when the year is complete.\nThe ancient year is that which dampness and dryness generate.\nDampness and dryness are that which cold and heat generate.\nCold and heat are that which the four seasons generate.\nThe four seasons are that which yin and yang generate.\nYin and yang are that which the numinous luminants generate.\nThe numinous luminants are that which heaven generates.\nHeaven and earth are that which the Great One generates.\nThus the Great One is concealed in water, moving through the seasons.\nRevolving, it may 〈begin anew, and can serve as〉 the mother of the ten thousand things.\nIt can be deficient, it can be full,\nUsing constancy to serve as the warp of the ten thousand things.\nThis is what heaven cannot destroy,\nWhat earth cannot bury,\nWhat yin and yang cannot complete.\nThe noble person knows this is called the 〈Dao/Way〉.\nBelow is earth, yet it is called earth.\nAbove is qi, yet it is called heaven.\nThe Dao/Way is also its name.\nI beg to hear its designation.\nThose who act in accordance with the Dao/Way must rely on its name;\nWhen the ancient affairs are accomplished, their persons endure.\nThe sage’s way of acting also relies on its name;\nWhen the ancient achievements are complete, their persons remain unharmed.\nHeaven and earth’s names stand in parallel,\nYet their transformations proceed in different directions, not deliberately corresponding.\n〈Heaven is insufficient〉 in the northwest, thus its lower regions are high and strong.\nEarth is insufficient in the southeast, thus its upper regions 〈are low and full〉.\nWhat is insufficient above has surplus below;\nWhat is insufficient below has surplus above.\nThe Dao/Way of heaven values weakness.\nThe completed bird nourishes the living.\nAttack the strong, rest in 〈weakness〉.\nIn the highest state, those below know it exists.\nSome approach it with intimacy and praise,\nSome with awe,\nSome with denial.\nWhen trust is insufficient, how can there be no mistrust?\nHow profound is its esteem for speech!\nWhen affairs are accomplished and merits recounted,\nThe hundred clans say, “We did it naturally.”\nWhen the great Dao/Way is abandoned, how can there be benevolence and righteousness?\nWhen the six relations are in discord, how can there be filial piety and kindness?\nWhen states and households are in chaos, how can there be upright ministers?\nGrasp the great image, and the world will come.\nComing without harm, peace and greatness abide.\nMusic and bait bring travelers to a halt.\nThus the 〈Dao/Way’s words〉 emerge:\nBland, they seem tasteless;\nLooked at, they cannot be seen;\nListened to, they cannot be heard.\nYet they cannot be exhausted.\nThe noble person at home values the left;\nIn warfare, the right is valued.\nThus it is said: Weapons 〈are inauspicious tools;\nOnly when unavoidable are they used〉.\nSharpness and stealth are best,\nNot to be glorified.\nTo glorify them is to delight in killing.\nThose who delight 〈in killing cannot〉 achieve their will in the world.\nThus in auspicious affairs, the left is primary;\nIn mourning, the right is primary.\nTherefore, the deputy general stands on the left,\nThe supreme general on the right.\nThis is to say, they are positioned as in mourning rites.\n〈When the slain are many〉, they are arranged with sorrowful mourners.\nWhen victorious in battle, they are positioned as in mourning rites.\nThose who act will fail;\nThose who grasp will lose.\nThe sage does nothing, thus does not fail;\nGrasps nothing, thus does not lose.\nBe cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nAnd there will be no failed affairs.\nPeople’s failures always occur when they are about to succeed.\nThus the sage desires what others do not desire,\nDoes not value rare goods;\nLearns what others do not learn,\nReturns to what the multitude has passed by.\nThus they can assist the naturalness of the ten thousand things\nWithout daring to act.\n\n**B. Chu Bamboo Slip Version B**\nIn governing people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly through frugality can one be early,\nThus early in submission.\nThis is called 〈accumulating virtue repeatedly.\nWith repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing〉 one cannot overcome.\n〈Nothing〉 one cannot overcome means none know its limits.\nWhen none know its limits, one can possess the state.\nPossessing the state’s mother, one can long 〈endure.\nThis is called deep roots and firm foundation〉,\nThe Dao/Way of long life and enduring vision.\nPursuing learning, one daily increases;\nPursuing the Dao/Way, one daily diminishes.\nDiminish and further diminish,\nUntil one reaches non-action.\n\nNon-action and no non-action.\nAbandon learning and there is no sorrow.\nBetween assent and reproach,\nHow far apart are they?\nWhat people fear,\nOne cannot but fear.\nGlory and disgrace are like a pendant—\nHonor great calamity as one’s own body.\n\nWhat is meant by \"glory and disgrace are like a pendant\"?\nGlory is a lowly thing:\nGained, it is like a pendant;\nLost, it is like a pendant.\nThis is called \"glory and disgrace are like a pendant.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"honor great calamity as one’s own body\"?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nIs that I have a body.\nWhen I no longer have a body,\nWhat calamity could there be?\nThus, one who values the body for the sake of the world\nMay be entrusted with the world.\nOne who cherishes the body for the sake of the world\nMay be relied upon with the world.\n\nThe highest scholar, hearing the Dao/Way,\nDiligently practices it.\nThe middling scholar, hearing the Dao/Way,\nHalf believes, half doubts.\nThe lowest scholar, hearing the Dao/Way,\nLaughs loudly at it.\nIf it were not laughed at,\nIt would not suffice to be the Dao/Way.\nTherefore, established sayings have it:\nThe bright Dao/Way seems obscure;\nThe advancing Dao/Way seems retreating.\nThe lofty virtue seems like a valley;\nGreat purity seems sullied;\nAbundant virtue seems insufficient.\nEstablished virtue seems furtive;\nTrue integrity seems fickle.\nGreat squareness has no corners;\nGreat vessels are slowly completed;\nGreat music is scarcely heard.\nThe celestial image has no form;\nThe Dao/Way 〈is nameless in its praise〉.\n\nClose the gates,\nSeal the openings,\nAnd to the end of life there will be no toil.\nOpen the openings,\nMultiply affairs,\nAnd to the end of life there will be no relief.\n\nGreat perfection seems flawed,\nYet its use is unexhausted.\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat skill seems clumsy;\nGreat accomplishment seems deficient;\nGreat uprightness seems bent.\n\nMovement overcomes cold;\nStillness overcomes heat.\nPurity and tranquility\nCan set the world in order.\n\nWhat is well established cannot be uprooted;\nWhat is well preserved cannot be lost.\nDescendants will continue their sacrifices without end.\n\nCultivate it in the self,\nAnd its virtue is true.\nCultivate it in the family,\nAnd its virtue overflows.\nCultivate it in the village,\nAnd its virtue endures.\nCultivate it in the state,\nAnd its virtue abounds.\nCultivate it in the world,\nAnd its virtue is vast.\nObserve the family through the family;\nObserve the village through the village;\nObserve the state through the state;\nObserve the world through the world.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nFrom the *A Manuscript of the Chu Bamboo Slips*:\n\nAbandon cunning and discard partiality,\nAnd the people’s benefit will increase a hundredfold.\nAbandon artifice and discard profit,\nAnd thieves and bandits will vanish.\nAbandon deceit and discard scheming,\nAnd the people will return to filial piety.\n\nThese three sayings, as governing principles, are not enough—\nSome must be commanded, some must be guided.\nHold to simplicity and preserve uncarved wood,\nLessen selfishness and restrain desire.\n\nThe rivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nBecause they can place themselves below them—\nThus they become kings of all valleys.\nThe sage stands before the people,\nYet places himself behind them;\nStands above the people,\nYet speaks humbly to them.\nWhen he stands above the people,\nThey do not feel his weight.\nWhen he stands before the people,\nThey do not feel harmed.\nThe world delights in advancing him and never tires.\nBecause he does not contend,\nNo one in the world can contend with him.\n\nNo crime is graver than excessive desire;\nNo misfortune is worse than covetousness;\nNo calamity is greater than discontent.\nKnowing contentment as contentment—\nThis is everlasting contentment.\n\nThose who assist rulers with military force\nDo not desire to dominate the world by arms.\nGood outcomes are achieved and nothing more—\nNot used to seize power.\nAchieve and do not boast,\nAchieve and do not arrogantly display,\nAchieve and do not claim credit—\nThis is called achieving without dominating,\nAnd such conduct is excellent.\n\nOf old, those who excelled as knights\nWere profoundly subtle, deeply penetrating, too profound to be known.\nThus I describe them:\nCautious, as if crossing a winter stream;\nWary, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;\nRespectful, as if a guest;\nYielding, as if ice about to melt;\nSimple, as if uncarved wood;\nVast, as if a valley;\nTurbid, as if muddy water.\n\nWho can make the turbid clear?\nIt will gradually become clear.\nWho can make the still move?\nIt will gradually come to life.\nThose who preserve this Way do not desire fullness.\nBecause they do not desire fullness,\nThey can remain hidden and complete renewal.\n\nTo act is to fail;\nTo grasp is to lose.\nTherefore the sage does not act and does not fail,\nDoes not grasp and does not lose.\nIn managing affairs,\nBe as careful at the end as at the beginning—\nThen there will be no failure.\nThe sage desires what others do not desire,\nDoes not value rare goods;\nLearns what others do not learn,\nReturns to what the multitude has passed by.\nThus the sage can assist the self-so of the myriad things\nWithout presuming to act.\n\nThe Way is ever without action.\nIf lords and kings can hold to it,\nThe myriad things will transform themselves.\nTransforming yet desiring to arise,\nI would restrain them with nameless simplicity.\nNameless simplicity—\nThey too will know contentment,\nKnowing contentment, they will be at peace,\nAnd the myriad things will settle of themselves.\n\nAct without acting,\nManage without managing,\nTaste without tasting.\n\nThe great begins in the small;\nThe high begins at the base.\nWhat is to be felled begins as a sapling;\nA nine-tiered terrace rises from heaps of earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles begins beneath the feet.\n\nThose who know do not speak;\nThose who speak do not know.\nClose the gates,\nBlunt the edges,\nSoften the glare,\nMerge with the dust,\nFile down the projections,\nUntangle the knots—\nThis is called the Mysterious Sameness.\n\nHeaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew,\nWhich the people, without command, receive equally.\nWhen the system of names first arose,\nNames were established.\nOnce names exist,\nOne must also know when to stop—\nKnowing when to stop prevents peril.\n\nThe Way in the world\nIs like small streams flowing into rivers and seas.\nAll things come to completion,\nYet existed before heaven and earth.\nSilent, formless,\nStanding alone without change,\nIt can be called the Mother of the world.\nI do not know its name—\nI style it the Dao.\nForced to name it, I call it Great.\nGreat means passing on,\nPassing on means going far,\nGoing far means returning.\n\nHeaven is great, earth is great,\nThe Dao is great, the king is also great.\nWithin the realm there are four great things,\nAnd the king occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nEarth models itself on heaven,\nHeaven models itself on the Dao,\nThe Dao models itself on the self-so.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nIt is like a bellows—\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nThe more it moves, the more it yields.\nTo reach emptiness is the constant goal;\nTo guard centeredness is the firm practice.\nThe myriad things arise together,\nAnd I observe their return.\n\nAll things flourish and return to their root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nStillness is called submitting to fate.\nSubmitting to fate is the constant.\nTo know the constant is called illumination.\n\nIn its stability, it is easily disturbed;\nBefore signs appear, it is easily planned for;\nIn its fragility, it is easily broken;\nIn its subtlety, it is easily scattered.\nAct before it exists;\nGovern before disorder arises.\n\nA tree as great as a man’s embrace\nBegins as a tiny shoot.\nA nine-tiered terrace\nRises from heaps of earth.\nA height of a hundred fathoms\nBegins beneath the feet.\n\nThus it cannot be made near, nor can it be made distant;\nIt cannot be made beneficial, nor can it be made harmful;\nIt cannot be made noble, nor can it be made base.\nTherefore, it is honored by all under heaven.\n\nGovern the state with uprightness,\nDeploy troops with cunning,\nWin the world without action.\nHow do I know this is so?\nThe more taboos in the world,\nThe poorer the people grow.\nThe more sharp tools the people possess,\nThe more troubled the state becomes.\nThe more knowledge people acquire,\nThe more strange things arise.\nThe more laws and decrees are promulgated,\nThe more thieves and bandits appear.\n\nTherefore, the sage declares:\nI take no action, and the people enrich themselves;\nI remain still, and the people transform of their own accord;\nI cherish tranquility, and the people rectify themselves;\nI desire not to desire, and the people return to simplicity.\n\nOne whose virtue is profound resembles an infant.\nWasps, scorpions, vipers, and snakes do not sting;\nFierce beasts do not seize;\nBirds of prey do not strike.\nThough bones are weak and sinews soft, the grasp is firm.\nUnknowing of the union of male and female, yet the essence is complete—\nSuch is the perfection of vitality.\nCrying all day without hoarseness—\nSuch is the perfection of harmony.\n\nTo know harmony is called constancy;\nTo know constancy is called illumination.\nTo augment life is called auspicious;\nTo let the mind command the qi is called strength.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—\nThis is called not following the Dao.\n\nWhich is dearer, fame or life?\nWhich is greater, life or wealth?\nWhich is more grievous, gain or loss?\nExcessive love must lead to great expenditure;\nHoarded wealth must lead to heavy loss.\nKnow contentment and avoid disgrace;\nKnow when to stop and avoid danger—\nThus can one endure long.\n\nThat which returns is the movement of the Dao;\nThat which is weak is the function of the Dao.\nAll things under heaven arise from being,\nAnd being arises from non-being.\n\nFill it to the brim, and it is better to stop;\nSharpen it to a point, and it cannot be preserved long.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.\nWealth and honor breed arrogance,\nAnd leave behind calamity.\nWithdraw when the work is done—\nThis is the Dao of heaven.\n\n[Fragment from the Mawangdui silk manuscript *Laozi* (A text):]\n...\nVirtue of highest virtue acts without intent;\nHighest benevolence acts, yet with intent;\nHighest righteousness acts, and with deliberate intent;\nHighest propriety acts, and when unanswered, stretches forth the arm to compel.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence follows;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety follows—\nPropriety is the mere husk of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of disorder.\n...\nForethought is the flower of the Dao,\nAnd the beginning of folly.\n\nThus the great man dwells in its thickness and not in its thinness,\nAbides in its substance and not in its flower.\nTherefore he discards the husk and takes the kernel.\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained □ and became tranquil;\nSpirits attained the One and became efficacious;\nValleys attained the One and became full.\nLords and kings attained the One and became the standard for the world.\nThis is how they attained it.\n\nIt is said: If heaven were not clear, it would fear cracking;\nIf earth were not tranquil, it would fear erupting;\nIf spirits were not efficacious, they would fear dissipating;\nIf valleys were not full, they would fear drying;\nIf lords and kings were not noble and high, they would fear toppling.\nThus what is noble must take the lowly as its root,\nWhat is high must take the low as its foundation.\n\nTherefore lords and kings call themselves \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"destitute\"—\nIs this not taking the lowly as their root?\nIs it not so?\nThus when one seeks many carriages, one ends with none.\nTherefore he does not desire to be as jade, but as common stone.\n\nThe Dao excels in □□□□□□□.\nThe movement of the Dao is weakness;\nThis is the function of the Dao.\nHeaven □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□.\nThe center of qi is harmony.\n\nWhat all under heaven detest are the orphaned, widowed, and destitute,\nYet kings and dukes use these terms to describe themselves.\nThings may be diminished yet thereby increased,\nOr increased yet thereby diminished.\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n\"The violent do not die a natural death.\"\nI take this as the father of my teaching.\n\nOf all things under heaven, none is more yielding than water,\nYet none is stronger in overcoming the hard.\nThere is nothing that can take its place.\nThe weak overcomes the strong;\nThe soft overcomes the hard.\nAll under heaven know this,\nYet none can practice it.\n\nThus the sage says:\n\"One who bears the state’s disgrace is called lord of the altars of soil and grain;\nOne who bears the state’s misfortunes is called king of all under heaven.\"\nStraight words seem paradoxical.\n\nVictory in cold, stillness in heat—\nOnly stillness can be the standard for all under heaven.\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao, swift horses are retired to fertilize fields;\nWhen the world does not follow the Dao, warhorses breed in the suburbs.\nNo crime is greater than having desires;\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing contentment;\nNo fault is greater than the desire for acquisition.\nThus the contentment of knowing contentment is ever content.\n\nWithout stepping outside one’s door, one can know all under heaven;\nWithout looking out the window, one can know the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus the sage knows without traveling,\nUnderstands without seeing,\nAccomplishes without acting.\n\nTo govern all under heaven, one must act without deliberate action.\nThose who are not content with this cannot govern all under heaven.\n\nWith the heart of all under heaven, one acts for the good:\nThe good are treated with goodness;\nThe not-good are also treated with goodness.\nThis is the power of goodness.\nThe trustworthy are trusted;\nThe not-trustworthy are also trusted.\nThis is the power of trust.\n\nIn the world, the sage contracts his heart,\nAnd all the people turn their ears and eyes to him.\nThe sage treats them all as children.\n\nAll people have their faculties—\nTen or three in ten go to their deaths,\nTen or three in ten go to their deaths.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they cling to life too tightly.\nIt is said: Those who are good at preserving life\nDo not meet rhinoceroses or tigers on the road,\nNor are they struck by weapons in battle.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nThe tiger has no place to sink its claws,\nWeapons have no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they have no place of death.\n\nThe Dao gives them life;\nVirtue nourishes them;\nThings shape them;\nCircumstances complete them.\nThus the myriad things honor the Dao and value virtue.\nThe honor of the Dao, the value of virtue—\nNothing commands this, yet it is always so of itself.\n\nThe Dao gives them life, nourishes them, rears them, matures them, refines them, nurtures them, and protects them.\nIt produces but does not possess,\nActs but does not presume,\nLeads but does not dominate.\n\nThis is called mysterious virtue.\nThe world has a beginning, which may be considered the mother of the world.\nHaving attained her, one may know her children;\nHaving known her children, one returns to guard their mother—\nThus one’s body does not perish to the end.\nBlock its openings, close its gates,\nAnd to the end of life there will be no toil.\nOpen its openings, meddle in its affairs,\nAnd to the end of life there will be no rescue.\n\nTo see the small is called discernment;\nTo guard the soft is called strength.\nUsing its light, one returns to its clarity,\nWithout leaving the body in peril—\nThis is called practicing the constant.\n\nWhen I seem to have knowledge,\nI walk the great Dao alone, fearing only to stray.\nThe great Dao is very level,\nYet the people delight in byways.\nThe court is very splendid,\nFields are very weedy,\nGranaries are very empty.\nThey wear fine clothes,\nCarry sharp swords,\nSate themselves with food and drink,\nPossess wealth in abundance—\nThese are called thieves’ boasts.\nFar indeed is this from the Dao!\n\nWhat is well planted cannot be uprooted;\nWhat is well embraced cannot slip away.\nThus from generation to generation its ancestral sacrifices will never cease.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;\nCultivate it in the family, and its virtue overflows;\nCultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;\nCultivate it in the state, and its virtue is abundant;\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.\nTherefore:\nObserve the self through the self;\nObserve the family through the family;\nObserve the village through the village;\nObserve the state through the state;\nObserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is so?\nBy this.\n\nIts richness is like that of an infant:\nPoisonous insects do not sting it,\nFierce beasts do not seize it,\nBirds of prey do not strike it.\nIts bones are weak, its sinews soft,\nYet its grasp is firm.\nIt does not yet know the union of male and female,\nYet its vital essence is complete—\nSo perfect is its vitality.\nIt cries all day without growing hoarse—\nSo perfect is its harmony.\n\nTo know harmony is called the constant;\nTo know the constant is called clarity.\nTo enhance life is called auspicious;\nFor the mind to command the qi is called strength.\nWhen things reach their prime, they grow old—\nThis is called not following the Dao.\nWhat does not follow the Dao perishes early.\n\nBlock its openings, close its gates,\nDull its sharpness,\nUntangle its knots,\nSoften its glare,\nMerge with its dust—\nThis is called mysterious sameness.\nThus one cannot be drawn near or kept at a distance,\nCannot be benefited or harmed,\nCannot be valued or debased—\nTherefore it is honored by the world.\n\nGovern the state with uprightness,\nDeploy the army with surprise,\nTake the world with non-interference.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nThe more taboos in the world,\nThe poorer the people;\nThe more sharp tools the people have,\nThe more troubled the state and family;\nThe more cunning the people,\nThe more strange things arise;\nThe more laws and decrees are promulgated,\nThe more thieves and bandits appear.\nTherefore the sage says:\nI do nothing, and the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, and the people right themselves;\nI do not meddle, and the people prosper themselves;\nI desire not to desire, and the people of themselves become simple as uncarved wood.\n\nWhen the government is dull and opaque,\nThe people are pure and simple;\nWhen the government is sharp and intrusive,\nThe people are lacking and deficient.\nCalamity is the support of fortune;\nFortune is the concealment of calamity.\nWho knows their ultimate point?\nIs there no uprightness?\nThe upright reverts to the strange,\nThe good reverts to the ominous—\nThe delusion of the people has indeed been long.\n\nTherefore the sage is square but not cutting,\nSharp but not piercing,\nStraight but not overbearing,\nBright but not dazzling.\n\nTo govern a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the world is governed by the Dao,\nIts ghosts do not haunt.\nNot that its ghosts are not numinous,\nBut their numinosity does not harm people;\nNot only do their numinosity not harm people,\nThe sage also does not harm them.\nAs neither harms the other,\nVirtue converges in them.\n\nA great state is the lower reaches of a river—\nThe female of the world,\nThe confluence of the world.\nThe female always overcomes the male by stillness,\nAnd by stillness is the lower.\nThus if a great state places itself below a small one,\nIt takes the small state;\nIf a small state places itself below a great one,\nIt is taken by the great state.\nThus some place themselves below to take,\nSome place themselves below and are taken.\nA great state desires nothing more than to unite and nurture people;\nA small state desires nothing more than to enter and serve people.\nBoth obtain what they desire,\nBut the great state must place itself below.\n\nThe Dao of heaven benefits and does not harm;\nThe Dao of the sage acts and does not contend.\nThe good man is the refuge of the world,\nThe refuge of the not-good man.\n\nFine words can win esteem in the marketplace,\nNoble conduct can exalt a person.\nYet why do they reject the not-good?\nThere is reason:\nWhen the Son of Heaven is established and the Three Ministers appointed,\nThough one may offer a shared jade disk before a team of four horses,\nIt is not as good as sitting to present this.\nWhat is the reason the ancients valued this?\nNot called seeking, yet one obtains;\nHaving transgressed, one is thereby exempt.\nThus it is prized by all under heaven.\n\nTo act as ruler is to act;\nTo act is to savor;\nYet whether great or small, many or few,\nRepay enmity with virtue.\nHow can one plan for difficulty?\n\nThe difficulties of all under heaven arise from the easy;\nThe greatness of all under heaven arises from the small.\nTherefore the sage never acts greatly,\nAnd so is able to accomplish greatness.\n\nThe myriad things must begin with difficulty—\nThis is why the sage deems difficulty precious,\nAnd thus never encounters difficulty.\nWhat is secure is easy to hold;\nWhat is foreseen is easy to plan;\nWhat is fragile is easy to break;\nWhat is minute is easy to scatter.\n\nAct before things arise;\nOrder before disorder begins.\nA nine-story tower rises from a basket of earth;\nA journey of a hundred *ren* begins beneath one’s feet.\n\nWhoever acts fails;\nWhoever grasps loses.\nThus the sage does not act, and so does not fail;\nDoes not grasp, and so does not lose.\n\nThe people in their undertakings\nEver near completion yet ruin them—\nThus if one is as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nThere will be no failure.\n\nTherefore the sage desires what others do not desire,\nAnd does not prize goods hard to obtain;\nLearns what others do not learn,\nAnd returns to what the multitude has passed over.\nThus he aids the myriad things in their natural unfolding,\nYet dares not act.\n\nHence it is said: those who practice the Way\nDo not seek to enlighten the people,\nBut rather to keep them simple.\nThe people are difficult to govern\nBecause of their knowledge.\nTherefore to govern the state through knowledge\nIs the state’s ruin;\nTo govern the state through ignorance\nIs the state’s blessing.\nTo constantly know these\n\nYet none among people can know it,\nNone can practice it.\nWords have their lord, affairs have their master—\nOnly the Dao knows this.\nThus those who lack this knowledge\nHold me in esteem.\n\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth while concealing jade.\nTo know yet appear not to know is excellence;\nNot to know yet appear to know is affliction.\nOnly by regarding affliction as affliction\nCan one be free from affliction.\nThe sage is free from affliction\nBecause he regards affliction as affliction—\nThus he is not afflicted.\n\nDo not display what you value,\nNor treasure what sustains you.\nOnly by not treasuring\nCan one be free from harm.\n\nTherefore:\nHe who dares to act recklessly will perish,\nHe who dares not act will endure.\nOf these two, one brings benefit, the other harm.\nThe Dao abhors none,\nYet none can fathom its judgment.\n\nThe sage does not contend,\nYet none can contend with him.\nThe saying goes:\n\"Not speaking, yet responding well;\nNot summoning, yet coming of itself;\nUnhurried, yet planning well.\"\n\nHow can one govern the people through killing?\nIf the people always feared death,\nThen those who acted perversely\nI could seize and kill—\nWho would dare?\nYet there is always an executioner.\nTo kill in place of the executioner\nIs like hewing in place of the master carpenter—\nFew who hew in place of the master carpenter\nAvoid injuring their own hands.\n\nThe people’s hunger\nComes from taking too much in taxes.\n\nThus, the disorder of the hundred clans\nStems from their superiors having something to rely upon.\nThus, the people’s reckless death\nComes from their seeking excessive means to live.\nTherefore, those who recklessly treat life as something to be acted upon\nAre those who esteem life.\nYet how people live is soft and weak,\nHow they die is hard and stiff.\nSo too with the myriad things—plants and trees:\nIn life, they are soft and supple;\nIn death, they are brittle and dry.\nHence it is said:\nThe hard and strong are followers of death,\nThe soft and weak, the delicate and fine, are followers of life.\nThus, when weapons are strong, they do not prevail;\nWhen trees are strong, they are felled.\nThe great and strong dwell below,\nThe soft and weak, the delicate and fine, dwell above.\n\nThe Way of Heaven:\nIt diminishes the excessive\nAnd supplements the deficient.\nThe Way of man is not so—\nIt diminishes the deficient\nTo offer to the excessive.\nWho can have abundance\nAnd yet take from Heaven to offer it?\nOnly one who holds to the Dao.\n\nThus the sage:\nActs without claiming merit,\nAchieves without taking credit.\nIs this not because he does not wish to display his worth?\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nYet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the hard and strong.\nBy this, none can replace it.\nThe weak overcomes the strong,\nThe soft overcomes the hard—\nNone in the world do not know this,\nYet none can practice it.\n\nTherefore the sage’s words say:\nTo bear the state’s disgrace\nIs called master of the altars of soil and grain;\nTo bear the state’s misfortune\nIs called king of all under Heaven.\nTrue words seem paradoxical.\n\nHow can great enmity be reconciled?\nIt must leave some resentment.\nHow can this be deemed good?\nThus the sage holds the tally of covenant\nYet does not demand of others.\nThose with virtue oversee the tally,\nThose without virtue oversee exactions.\n\nThe Way of Heaven shows no partiality,\nYet it ever aids the good.\n\nThe nameless is the origin of the myriad things;\nThe named is the mother of the myriad things.\nThus, always without desire,\nObserve its subtleties;\nAlways with desire,\nObserve its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet differ in name.\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and more profound,\nThe gateway to all subtleties.\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nUgliness arises;\nWhen all know good as good,\nNot-good arises.\nThus being and non-being produce each other,\nDifficult and easy complete each other,\nLong and short shape each other,\nHigh and low fill each other,\nTones and voices harmonize with each other,\nFront and back follow each other—\nThis is ever so.\n\nTherefore the sage abides in non-action,\nConducts affairs without interference,\nAnd teaches without words.\nThe myriad things arise yet are not turned away,\nThey are brought forth yet not possessed,\nWork is accomplished yet not dwelt upon.\nOnly because it is not dwelt upon\nDoes it not depart.\n\nNot exalting the worthy\nPrevents contention;\nNot prizing rare goods\nPrevents theft;\nNot displaying what is desirable\nPrevents confusion of the people’s hearts.\nThus the sage’s governance:\nEmpties their minds,\nFills their bellies,\nWeakens their wills,\nStrengthens their bones—\nEver keeps the people without knowledge, without desire.\nMakes those with knowledge not dare to act.\nActing without interference,\nThere is nothing left undone.\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nThe nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nThe named is the mother of the myriad things.\nThus, always without desire,\nObserve its mysteries;\nAlways with desire,\nObserve its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet differ in name.\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and more profound,\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not humane,\nThey treat the myriad things as straw dogs;\nThe sage is not humane,\nHe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe space between Heaven and Earth—\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nMoving and ever more issuing forth.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion;\nBetter to abide in the center.\n\nThe spirit of the valley never dies—\nThis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gateway of the mysterious female—\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle yet ever-present,\nIts use is inexhaustible.\n\nHeaven is eternal, Earth everlasting.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and everlasting\nIs because they do not live for themselves.\nThus they can long endure.\nTherefore the sage puts himself last yet finds himself first,\nSets himself aside yet is preserved.\nIs it not because he is without self-interest\nThat he can achieve his self-interest?\n\nThe highest good is like water.\nWater benefits the myriad things without contention,\nFlowing to places people disdain—\nThus it is near the Dao.\nIn dwelling, be close to the earth;\nIn the heart, be deep;\nIn dealing with others, be kind;\nIn speech, be sincere;\nIn governance, be just;\nIn affairs, be competent;\nIn action, be timely.\nOnly by not contending\nCan one be free from blame.\n\nFill it to the brim, and it will spill—\nBetter not to overfill.\nHone it to a point, and it will soon dull—\nOne cannot long preserve it.\nA hall filled with gold and jade\nCannot be guarded.\nWealth and honor with arrogance\nBring self-inflicted calamity.\nWithdraw when the work is done—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nCan you embrace the One and not stray?\nConcentrate your qi and attain suppleness—\nCan you be like an infant?\nPurify your profound vision—\nCan you be without flaw?\nLove the people and govern the state—\nCan you be without cunning?\nThe gateway of Heaven opens and closes—\nCan you play the female?\nUnderstanding all within the four seas—\nCan you be without knowledge?\nIt gives birth and nurtures,\nGives birth yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely on,\nLeads yet does not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\nThirty spokes converge at a single hub—\nIt is the emptiness that makes the wheel useful.\nClay is shaped to form a vessel—\nIt is the emptiness that makes the vessel useful.\nDoors and windows are cut to form a room—\nIt is the emptiness that makes the room useful.\nThus, what is present provides the benefit,\nWhat is absent provides the use.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes;\nThe five tones deafen the ears;\nThe five flavors dull the palate;\nRacing and hunting madden the mind;\nRare goods ensnare a person’s conduct.\nThus the sage’s governance:\nFor the belly, not for the eyes—\nTherefore he discards the latter and takes the former.\n\nThis fears disgrace as if startled, values great misfortune as if it were the body—what is called fearing disgrace as if startled? What is called valuing great misfortune as if it were the body? My having great misfortune is because I have a body; when I have no body, what misfortune could there be? Thus, one who values the body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes the body for the sake of the world may be given the world.\n\nLook at it yet do not see—call it the Subtle;\nListen to it yet do not hear—call it the Rare;\nGrasp it yet do not obtain—call it the Minute.\nThese three cannot be fully fathomed,\nThus they merge into one.\nIts rising brings no light,\nIts sinking brings no darkness,\nUnceasing, unnameable,\nIt returns to nothingness—\nThis is called the form of the formless,\nThe image of nothingness.\nThis is called the indistinct and shadowy.\nFollow it yet do not see its back,\nGrasp it yet do not see its front.\nHold to the Dao of the present to master what is present,\nTo know the ancient beginning—\nThis is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nProfound, unfathomable!\nOnly because it is unfathomable,\nI forcefully describe its appearance:\nHesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;\nCautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;\nReserved, as if a guest;\nDispersing, as if melting ice;\nSimple, as if uncarved wood;\nVast, as if a valley;\nTurbid, as if muddy water.\nWho can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?\nWho can stir the still and gradually bring it to life?\nOne who preserves this Dao does not desire fullness—\nOnly because of not desiring fullness,\nCan one remain unspoiled and complete.\n\nAll things arise side by side,\nI thereby observe their return.\nAll things flourish,\nEach returns to its root—\nThis is called returning to destiny,\nReturning to destiny is constancy.\nKnowing constancy is enlightenment;\nNot knowing constancy leads to recklessness and disaster.\nKnowing constancy is all-embracing;\nAll-embracing is impartial;\nImpartial is kingly;\nKingly is heavenly;\nHeavenly is the Dao;\nDao is enduring—\nOne’s body may perish, but one does not.\n\nThe highest rulers—people know they exist;\nThe next—people love and praise them;\nThe next—people fear them;\nThe lowest—people despise them.\nIf trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.\nHow careful they are with their words!\nWhen tasks are accomplished and affairs completed,\nThe people all say, “We are naturally so.”\nWhen the great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise;\nWhen wisdom and cunning emerge, great hypocrisy follows;\nWhen the six relations are disharmonious, filial piety and kindness appear;\nWhen the state is in chaos, loyal ministers emerge.\nCut off sagacity, abandon knowledge—people will benefit a hundredfold;\nCut off benevolence, abandon righteousness—people will return to filial piety and kindness;\nCut off skill, abandon profit—thieves and robbers will disappear.\nThese three sayings, as cultural refinements, are insufficient,\nThus let them have something to which they belong:\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nReduce self-interest, diminish desires.\n\nWhat is the difference between approval and disdain?\nWhat is the difference between good and evil?\nWhat others fear, I too must fear—\nHow boundless this seems!\nThe people all rejoice,\nAs if feasting at a great sacrifice,\nAs if ascending a tower in spring.\nI alone remain unmoved,\nLike an infant who has not yet smiled,\nWeary, as if with no place to return.\nThe people all have more than enough,\nI alone seem lacking.\nI have the mind of a fool—how muddled!\nThe common people are bright,\nI alone am dim.\nThe common people are discerning,\nI alone am dull.\nVast, like the sea,\nCeaseless, like the wind,\nThe people all have purpose,\nI alone am stubborn and rustic.\nI alone differ from others,\nAnd value being nourished by the Mother.\n\nThe power of profound virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe things of the Dao are indistinct and shadowy—\nShadowy, yet within there are images;\nIndistinct, yet within there are forms;\nObscure, yet within there is essence;\nIts essence is most real,\nWithin it there is trust.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nIts name does not depart,\nTo observe the source of all things.\nHow do I know the nature of all things?\nBy this.\n\nOne who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;\nOne who takes long strides cannot walk far;\nOne who displays himself is not enlightened;\nOne who justifies himself has no merit;\nOne who boasts of himself does not endure.\nIn the Dao, these are called excess food and superfluous action—\nThings may despise them.\nThus, one who possesses the Dao does not abide in them.\nThe crooked will be made whole;\nThe bent will be straightened;\nThe hollow will be filled;\nThe worn will be renewed;\nThe few will gain;\nThe many will be confused.\nThus the sage holds to the One and governs the world.\nHe does not display himself, thus is enlightened;\nHe does not justify himself, thus has merit;\nHe does not boast, thus endures;\nHe does not contend, thus none in the world can contend with him.\nThe ancient saying, “The crooked will be made whole,”\nIs this not true?\nTruly, it returns and is preserved.\n\nThere is a thing, chaotic yet complete,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\nSilent, formless,\nIt stands alone and does not change,\nIt pervades all and does not fail,\nIt may be considered the Mother of all under heaven.\nI do not know its name—\nI style it the Dao;\nForced to name it, I call it Great.\nGreat means it flows ever onward,\nFlowing ever onward means it is far-reaching,\nFar-reaching means it returns.\nThus the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nThe king is also great.\nWithin the realm, there are four greats,\nAnd the king occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nEarth models itself on heaven,\nHeaven models itself on the Dao,\nThe Dao models itself on nature.\n\nThe noble person, in daily conduct, does not depart from the weight of the body.\nThough there are palaces for pleasure,\nHow can a ruler of ten thousand chariots be careless with his body in the world?\nCarelessness loses the root,\nRestlessness loses the ruler.\nGood travelers leave no tracks;\nGood speakers make no flaws;\nGood calculators use no tallies;\nGood closers need no bolts, yet none can open;\nGood binders need no cords, yet none can untie.\nThus the sage is always good at saving people, and so abandons no one;\nAlways good at saving things, and so abandons nothing—\nThis is called inheriting enlightenment.\nThus the good person is the teacher of the not-good;\nThe not-good person is the resource of the good.\nNot to value one’s teacher,\nNot to love one’s resource—\nThough knowledgeable, this is great delusion.\nThis is called the essential subtlety.\n\nKnow the masculine, hold to the feminine,\nBe the valley of the world—\nBeing the valley of the world,\nConstant virtue does not depart,\nReturn to infancy.\nKnow the white, hold to the black,\nBe the pattern of the world—\nBeing the pattern of the world,\nConstant virtue does not err,\nReturn to the limitless.\nKnow honor, hold to disgrace,\nBe the valley of the world—\nConstant virtue is then complete,\nReturn to simplicity.\nSimplicity scatters and becomes vessels;\nThe sage uses them and becomes the ruler of officials.\nThus the great system does not cut.\n\nThose who would take the world and act upon it, I see they will not succeed.\nThe world is a sacred vessel—\nIt cannot be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it ruin it;\nThose who grasp it lose it.\n\nThose who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.\nThings may move or rest, may be warm or cool, may strengthen or weaken.\nThus the sage abandons excess, abandons extravagance, abandons extremity.\n\nUse the Dao to assist the ruler of men—\nDo not use weapons to force the world.\nSuch deeds tend to rebound.\nWhere armies camp, thorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great wars, years of famine follow.\n\nThe skilled commander achieves his aim and stops—\nHe does not press for dominance.\nHe achieves his aim but does not boast,\nAchieves his aim but does not exult,\nAchieves his aim but does not take it as his due.\nThis is called achieving one’s aim without force.\n\nThings flourish and then age—\nThis is called not following the Dao.\nWhat does not follow the Dao perishes early.\n\nWeapons are inauspicious tools—\nAll things may despise them.\nThus those who possess the Dao do not dwell in them.\nThe noble person values the left in ordinary times,\nBut in war values the right.\nWeapons are not the tools of the noble person—\nThey are inauspicious tools.\nUsed only when unavoidable,\nRestraint is best—do not glorify them.\nTo glorify them is to delight in killing.\nThose who delight in killing cannot achieve their will in the world.\n\nThus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;\nIn mourning affairs, the right is honored.\nTherefore the deputy general stands on the left,\nThe supreme general stands on the right—\nThis is to say they are positioned as in mourning rites.\nWhen many are killed, stand with sorrow and grief.\nWhen victorious in battle, observe mourning rites.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\nOnly when it is cut and carved do names arise.\nWhen names arise, know that it is time to stop.\nKnowing when to stop averts danger—\nThe Dao in the world is like streams and valleys flowing into rivers and seas.\n\nKnowing others is wisdom;\nKnowing oneself is clarity.\nOvercoming others requires force;\nOvercoming oneself is strength.\nThose who persist have resolve;\nThose who do not lose their place endure.\nThose who die yet are not forgotten live long.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless—\nIt accomplishes its work yet claims no credit.\nAll things return to it,\nYet it does not act as their master.\nEver without desire,\nIt may be called small.\nAll things return to it,\nYet it does not act as their master—\nIt may be called great.\nThus the sage’s ability to achieve greatness\nLies in not acting great—\nTherefore he achieves greatness.\n\nHold to the great image, and all things will come—\nComing without harm, in peace and great joy.\nMusic and fine food make the passerby pause.\nThus when the Dao is expressed in words,\nIt is bland and without flavor.\nLooked at, it is not enough to be seen;\nListened to, it is not enough to be heard;\nUsed, it is not enough to be exhausted.\n\nTo listen to it is not enough to hear it;\nTo use it is not enough to exhaust it.\n\nWhen you wish to gather it, you must first spread it;\nWhen you wish to weaken it, you must first strengthen it;\nWhen you wish to discard it, you must first grant it;\nWhen you wish to seize it, you must first give it.\nThis is called subtle illumination.\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nFish must not leave the depths;\nThe state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless—\nIf lords and kings can hold to it,\nAll things will transform themselves.\nTransformed yet desiring to take form,\nI shall restrain them with nameless simplicity.\nNameless simplicity—\nThey will no longer be humbled.\nBy not being humbled, they will return to their true nature,\nAnd heaven and earth will right themselves.\n\nThe highest virtue does not act virtuous—thus it possesses virtue.\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue—thus it lacks virtue.\nThe highest virtue does not act and does not act with intent.\nThe highest benevolence acts but does not act with intent.\nThe highest righteousness acts and acts with intent.\nThe highest ritual acts, yet if none respond,\nIt waves its arms and drags them along.\n\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises.\nRitual is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nForeknowledge is the flower of the Dao,\nAnd the beginning of folly.\n\nTherefore the great man dwells in the substantial,\nNot in the superficial;\nIn the fruit, not in the flower.\nThus he discards the latter and takes the former.\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became stable;\nThe spirits attained the One and became efficacious;\nThe valleys attained the One and became full;\nLords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all.\nAt their utmost:\nIf heaven were not clear, it would fear splitting;\nIf earth were not stable, it would fear crumbling;\nIf the spirits were not efficacious, they would fear vanishing;\nIf the valleys were not full, they would fear drying;\nIf lords and kings were not noble and lofty, they would fear toppling.\n\nThus, nobility must have lowliness as its root;\nLoftiness must have lowness as its foundation.\nTherefore lords and kings call themselves \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"destitute\"—\nIs this not taking lowliness as their root? Is it not?\nThus, the highest renown is no renown.\nDo not desire to be lustrous like jade,\nBut coarse like stone.\n\nThe highest Dao—how can it be practiced?\nThe superior man hears of the Dao and practices it diligently;\nThe middling man hears of the Dao and wavers between belief and doubt;\nThe inferior man hears of the Dao and laughs loudly.\nIf he did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.\n\nThus the established sayings have it:\nThe bright Dao seems dim;\nThe advancing Dao seems retreating;\nThe level Dao seems uneven;\nThe highest virtue seems like a valley;\nThe great purity seems sullied;\nThe vast virtue seems insufficient;\nThe established virtue seems frail;\nThe true substance seems shifting.\nThe great square has no corners;\nThe great vessel is late in completion;\nThe great sound is scarcely heard;\nThe great image has no form.\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\nOnly the Dao is good at beginning and good at completion.\n\nThe movement of the Dao is return;\nThe function of the Dao is weakness.\nAll things under heaven are born of being;\nBeing is born of non-being.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One;\nThe One gives birth to the Two;\nThe Two gives birth to the Three;\nThe Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nBlending their qi to attain harmony.\n\nWhat people dislike are \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"destitute,\"\nYet kings and lords use these to refer to themselves.\nThus, things may be diminished yet thereby increased,\nOr increased yet thereby diminished.\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n\"The violent do not die a natural death.\"\nI will take this as the father of my teaching.\n\nIf the world had the Dao, warhorses would be retired to plow the fields;\nIf the world lacked the Dao, warhorses would be bred in the suburbs.\nNo crime is greater than having desires;\nNo disaster is greater than not knowing contentment;\nNo fault is greater than desiring gain.\nThus, knowing contentment is ever content.\n\nWithout stepping outside, one can know the world;\nWithout looking out the window, one can see the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus the sage knows without traveling,\nNames without seeing,\nAnd accomplishes without acting.\n\nThe way of learning is to increase daily;\nThe way of the Dao is to decrease daily.\nDecreasing and further decreasing,\nUntil one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nTo take the world, one must always act without acting.\nIf one acts with sufficient effort,\nIt is not enough to take the world.\n\nThe sage has no constant mind;\nHe takes the mind of the people as his mind.\nThose who are good, I treat as good;\nThose who are not good, I also treat as good—\nThus attaining virtue.\nThose who are trustworthy, I trust;\nThose who are not trustworthy, I also trust—\nThus attaining trust.\n\nThe sage in the world is self-effacing,\nAnd all things converge upon him.\nThe people all fix their gaze upon him,\nAnd the sage regards them as his children.\n\nLife gives birth to death.\nThe companions of life are thirteen;\nThe companions of death are thirteen.\nPeople’s lives lead them to the realm of death—\nAlso thirteen.\nWhy is this?\nBecause of the intensity of their striving for life.\n\nI have heard that one who is good at preserving life\nWalks through the mountains without avoiding rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnters battle without donning armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn;\nThe tiger has no place to sink its claws;\nWeapons have no place to pierce their edge.\nWhy is this?\nBecause there is no place of death in him.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to them;\nVirtue nurtures them;\nMatter shapes them;\nCircumstances complete them.\nThus the myriad things honor the Dao and value virtue.\nThe honor of the Dao and the value of virtue\nAre not conferred but always naturally so.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One;\nThe One gives birth to the Two;\nThe Two gives birth to the Three;\nThe Three give birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nBlending their qi to attain harmony.\nWhat people dislike are \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"destitute,\"\nYet kings and lords use these to refer to themselves.\nThus, things may be diminished yet thereby increased,\nOr increased yet thereby diminished.\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n\"The violent do not die a natural death.\"\nThis I take as the father of my teaching.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to them,\nNurtures them, rears them, raises them,\nShelters them, ripens them, sustains them, and returns them—\nYet does not claim lordship over them.\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nWhich is taken as the mother of the world.\nHaving attained its mother,\nOne thereby knows her children.\nHaving known her children,\nOne again guards their mother—\nAnd to the end of life suffers no harm.\n\nBlock its openings,\nShut its gates,\nAnd to the end of life one will not toil.\nOpen its openings,\nMultiply its affairs,\nAnd to the end of life one will not be saved.\n\nSeeing the small is called clarity;\nGuarding the soft is called strength.\nUsing its light,\nReturning to its clarity,\nAnd not bringing misfortune upon oneself—\nThis is called practicing the constant.\n\nLet me have but little knowledge,\nAnd walk the great Dao,\nFearing only straying from it.\nThe great Dao is very level,\nBut the people delight in byways.\n\nThe court is very well adorned,\nThe fields are very weedy,\nThe granaries are very empty.\nThey wear fine clothes,\nCarry sharp swords,\nSate themselves with food and drink,\nAnd possess wealth in excess—\nThese are called the boasts of thieves.\nThis is not the Dao.\n\nWhat is well established does not uproot;\nWhat is well embraced does not slip away.\nThus, from generation to generation its ancestral sacrifices never cease.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;\nCultivate it in the family, and its virtue overflows;\nCultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;\nCultivate it in the state, and its virtue abounds;\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.\n\nTherefore,\nObserve the self through the self;\nObserve the family through the family;\nObserve the state through the state;\nObserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nOne whose virtue is profoundly thick\nIs like a newborn babe:\nPoisonous insects do not sting it,\nFierce beasts do not seize it,\nBirds of prey do not strike it.\nIts bones are weak, its sinews soft,\nYet its grip is firm.\nIt does not yet know the union of male and female,\nYet its organ stirs—\nSuch is the perfection of its essence.\nIt howls all day without growing hoarse—\nSuch is the perfection of its harmony.\n\nKnowing harmony is called the constant;\nKnowing the constant is called clarity.\nBenefiting life is called auspicious;\nThe heart directing qi is called strength.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—\nThis is called not following the Dao.\nWhat does not follow the Dao perishes early.\n\nThose who know do not speak;\nThose who speak do not know.\nBlock its openings,\nShut its gates,\nBlunt its sharpness,\nUntie its tangles,\nHarmonize its light,\nMerge with its dust—\nThis is called profound union.\nThus, it cannot be made close,\nNor can it be made distant;\nIt cannot be benefited,\nNor can it be harmed;\nIt cannot be valued,\nNor can it be demeaned.\nTherefore, it is honored by the world.\n\nGovern the state with uprightness,\nDeploy the army with surprise,\nTake the world with non-interference.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\n\nThe more taboos and prohibitions there are in the world,\nThe poorer the people become;\nThe more sharp weapons the people possess,\nThe more troubled the state and clan;\nThe more cunning and skill the people have,\nThe more strange things arise;\nThe more laws and commands are issued,\nThe more thieves and bandits appear.\n\nTherefore, the sage says:\nI do not act, and the people transform themselves;\nI delight in tranquility, and the people rectify themselves;\nI do not interfere, and the people enrich themselves;\nI desire not to desire, and the people simplify themselves.\n\nWhen its government is unadorned,\nThe people are simple;\nWhen its government is scrutinizing,\nThe people are lacking.\nMisfortune is that upon which fortune depends;\nFortune is that in which misfortune lurks.\nWho knows their ultimate point?\nThere is no uprightness.\nThe upright reverts to the strange,\nThe good reverts to the ominous—\nThis has long been so.\n\nThus, square yet not cutting,\nAll-embracing yet not piercing,\nStraight yet not taut,\nLuminous yet not dazzling.\n\nIn governing people and serving Heaven,\nnothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly through frugality can one be early\nto submit—this is called accumulating virtue in abundance.\nAccumulating virtue in abundance,\nthere is nothing one cannot overcome.\nWhen nothing cannot be overcome,\nnone know its limit.\nWhen one possesses the mother of the state,\none can long endure.\nThis is called having deep roots and a firm foundation,\nthe Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the world is established by the Dao,\nits ghosts do not possess numinous power.\nNot that its ghosts lack numinous power,\nbut their numinosity does not harm people.\nNot only do their spirits not harm people,\nthe sage also does not harm them.\nAs neither inflicts harm,\nvirtue converges and returns.\n\nA great state flows downstream,\nthe confluence of the world.\nThe female always overcomes the male through tranquility,\nfor tranquility is the lower position.\nThus, when a great state humbles itself before a small state,\nit gains the allegiance of the small state;\nwhen a small state humbles itself before a great state,\nit is embraced by the great state.\nTherefore, some humble themselves to gain,\nwhile others, by humbling themselves, are gained.\nA great state desires nothing more than to unite and nurture people;\na small state desires nothing more than to enter and serve others.\nWhen both attain what they desire,\nthe greater should assume the lower position.\n\nThe Dao is the reservoir of the myriad things,\nthe treasure of the good,\nthe refuge of the not-good.\n\nFine words can secure esteem,\nnoble conduct can exalt others.\nYet those who are not good—\nhow can they be established?\n\nThus, when enthroning the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes,\nthough one may offer jade discs followed by teams of four horses,\nit is not equal to sitting and presenting this teaching of old.\n\nNot by seeking does one obtain,\nnor by guilt does one escape.\nTherefore, it is prized by all under heaven.\n\nWhat is delicate—\nthe world’s smallest—\nis the world’s easiest to move;\nthe world’s greatest—\nis the world’s hardest to shift.\n\nThus, the sage does not act,\nand so does not fail;\ndoes not grasp,\nand so does not lose.\n\nIn their undertakings,\nthe people ever near completion yet ruin them.\nTherefore, it is said:\n\"Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nand you will not fail in your affairs.\"\n\nThus, the sage desires what others do not desire,\nand does not prize rare and hard-to-obtain goods;\nlearns what others do not learn,\nrestoring what the multitude has passed over.\nAble to assist the self-so of the myriad things,\nyet dares not act.\n\nOf old, those who followed the Dao\ndid not thereby enlighten the people,\nbut rather made them simple.\nThe people are hard to govern\nbecause of their knowledge.\n\nThus, knowledge is the state’s thief,\nwhile unknowing is the state’s virtue.\nEver knowing these two is also a model—\never knowing this model:\nthis is called the profound virtue,\ndeep and far-reaching.\nThings return,\nand so reach great compliance.\n\nThe Jiang and the sea can be kings of the hundred valleys\nbecause they excel at being below them—\nthus they can be kings of the hundred valleys.\nTherefore, when the sage desires to be above the people,\nthey must place their words below them;\nwhen they desire to lead the people,\nthey must place themselves behind them.\nThus, though dwelling above, the people do not find them burdensome;\nthough dwelling ahead, the people do not find them harmful.\nThe world all delights in them and does not weary.\nBecause they do not contend,\nno one in the world can contend with them.\n\nLet a small state have few people—\nlet it have tools for ten or a hundred yet not use them;\nlet the people value death and not travel far.\nThough there be boats and carriages, none ride them;\nthough there be armor and weapons, none display them.\nLet the people return to knotting cords and using them.\nSweet be their food,\nbeautiful their clothing,\npeaceful their customs,\ncontent their dwellings.\nNeighboring states may gaze upon one another,\nthe sounds of their dogs and chickens heard,\nyet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.\n\nTrue words are not fine;\nfine words are not true.\nThe knowing are not learned;\nthe learned are not knowing.\nThe good are not many;\nthe many are not good.\n\nThe sage accumulates nothing—\nhaving given all to others, they have more;\nhaving bestowed all on others, they have abundance.\nThus, the Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm;\nthe Dao of Humankind acts yet does not contend.\n\nThe world calls me great,\nyet I seem lacking.\nIt is because I seem lacking that I am great—\nhad I been full, long since would I have been small.\nI ever have three treasures,\nwhich I hold and cherish:\nthe first is compassion,\nthe second is frugality,\nthe third is not daring to be first in the world.\nWith compassion, one can be brave;\nwith frugality, one can be expansive;\nnot daring to be first in the world,\none can become the vessel of leadership.\n\nNow, abandon compassion and yet be brave,\nabandon frugality and yet be expansive,\nabandon the rear and yet be first—\nthis is death.\nFor with compassion, in attack there is victory,\nin defense there is solidity.\nHeaven will establish one\nas if surrounding them with compassion.\n\nThus, the good warrior is not martial,\nthe good fighter is not enraged,\nthe good conqueror does not contend,\nthe good employer of others places themselves below.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthis is called employing others,\nthis is called matching Heaven—\nthe ultimate of old.\n\nOn the use of arms, it is said:\n\"I dare not be the host but act as guest;\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"\nThis is called marching without marching,\nraising arms without arms,\ngrasping weapons without weapons,\nfacing enemies without enemies.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy—\nunderestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasures.\nThus, when evenly matched armies meet,\nthe grieving side prevails.\n\nMy words are easy to know,\neasy to practice,\nyet none in the world can know them,\nnone can practice them.\nWords have a source,\naffairs have a lord.\nIt is only through unknowing\nthat they do not know me.\nThose who know me are few—\nthus I am esteemed.\nTherefore, the sage wears coarse cloth yet holds jade.\n\nTo know yet seem not to know is excellence;\nnot to know yet think one knows is sickness.\nOnly by regarding this sickness as sickness\ncan one be without sickness.\nThe people’s not fearing\nmeans great fear is coming.\n\nDo not cramp their dwelling,\ndo not weary their livelihood.\nOnly by not wearying them\ncan one avoid weariness.\nThus, the sage knows themselves yet does not display themselves,\nloves themselves yet does not prize themselves.\nTherefore, they discard the latter and take the former.\n\nBe brave in daring, and you will be killed;\nbe brave in not daring, and you will live.\nOf these two, one brings benefit, one brings harm.\nHeaven’s disdain—who knows the reason?\nThus, the Dao of Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory,\ndoes not speak yet excels at response,\nis not summoned yet comes of itself,\nis at ease yet excels at planning.\nHeaven’s net is vast—\nwide-meshed yet nothing slips through.\n\nIf the people ever cease to fear death,\nhow can killing be used to threaten them?\nIf the people ever must fear death,\nthen those who act perversely—\nwho can seize and kill them?\nIf the people ever must fear death,\nthere is always an executioner.\nTo kill in place of the executioner\nis like hewing in place of the master carpenter—\nthose who hew in place of the master carpenter\nrarely avoid injuring their hands.\n\nThe people’s hunger\ncomes from their rulers’ excessive taxation—\nthus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed\ncomes from their superiors’ meddling—\nthus they are ungovernable.\nThe people’s disregard for death\ncomes from their rulers’ excessive pursuit of life—\nthus they disregard death.\nOnly those who do not act for the sake of life\nsurpass those who prize life.\n\nOf all things in the world,\nnone is more supple and weak than water,\nyet none excels it in overcoming the hard and strong—\nnothing can take its place.\nThe weak overcomes the strong,\nthe supple overcomes the rigid.\nThe world knows this,\nyet none can practice it.\n\nThus, the strong and rigid are companions of death,\nthe supple and weak are companions of life.\nTherefore, when arms are strong, they are not victorious;\nwhen trees are strong, they break.\nThe great and strong dwell below,\nthe supple and weak dwell above.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow:\nthe high is pressed down,\nthe low is raised up.\nWhat has excess is reduced,\nwhat is deficient is supplemented.\nThe Dao of Humankind is not so—\nit reduces the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can take excess and offer it to the world?\nOnly one who has the Dao.\n\nThus, the sage acts yet does not possess,\naccomplishes yet does not dwell.\nIn this way, they do not desire to display their worth.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing excels it in overcoming the hard and strong—\nnothing can replace it.\n\nThus, the sage’s words declare:\nTo receive the state’s disgrace is called the master of the altars of soil and grain;\nto bear the realm’s misfortune is called the king of all under Heaven.\nStraightforward words seem their opposite.\n\nGreat [rectitude...]\nActing with goodness—\ntherefore, the sage holds the left tally and does not demand from others.\nThose with virtue oversee the tally;\nthose without virtue oversee the tax.\n[...]\n\nVirtue: three thousand and one.\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.\n[...]\nThe name that can be named is not the constant name.\nThe nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things;\nthe named is the mother of the ten thousand things.\nThus, always without desire,\n[...]\nalways with desire—\nby these one observes their subtleties.\nThe two emerge together yet have different names.\nTogether they are called the profound,\nthe gateway of the manifold mysteries.\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—thus, ugliness arises;\nall know goodness as goodness—thus, not-goodness arises.\n[...]\nBeing and non-being give rise to one another;\ndifficult and easy complete one another;\nlong and short shape one another;\nhigh and low fill one another;\nnotes and voices harmonize one another;\nbefore and after follow one another—\nthis is constant.\n\nTherefore, the sage abides in non-action and practices the teaching without words.\nThe ten thousand things arise yet are not begun;\nthey act yet are not relied upon;\nthey accomplish yet do not dwell.\nOnly because they do not dwell do they not depart.\n\nNot exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending;\nnot prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing;\nnot displaying what is desirable prevents the people’s hearts from being disturbed.\nThus, the sage’s governance:\nempties their minds,\nfills their bellies,\nweakens their ambitions,\nstrengthens their bones.\nAlways causes the people to be without knowledge and without desire.\nCauses the wise not to dare act—\nthen there is nothing ungoverned.\n\nThe Dao is empty yet its use is inexhaustible.\nProfound! It seems the ancestor of the ten thousand things.\nBlunts its sharpness,\nuntangles its knots,\nsoftens its glare,\nunites with its dust.\nDeep! It seems perhaps to endure.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit resembles the ancestor of the gods.\n\nHeaven and earth are not humane;\nthey treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not humane;\nthey treat the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe space between heaven and earth—\nis it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nmoving and ever more issuing forth.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nnot as good as guarding the center.\n\nThe spirit of the valley does not die—\nthis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gateway of the mysterious female—\nthis is called the root of heaven and earth.\nGossamer-like, it seems to endure;\nits use is never exhausted.\n\nHeaven is long, earth is enduring.\nHeaven and earth can be long and enduring because they do not live for themselves—\nthus, they can long endure.\nTherefore, the sage withdraws their person yet their person comes first;\nsets their person aside yet their person remains.\nIs it not because they are without self-interest?\nThus, they can achieve their self-interest.\n\nThe highest good is like water—\nwater benefits the ten thousand things yet contends not.\nIt dwells in places all shun—\nthus, it is near the Dao.\nIn dwelling, be good to the earth;\nin the heart, be good to the abyss;\nin giving, be good to heaven;\nin speech, be good to trust;\nin governance, be good to order;\nin affairs, be good to ability;\nin movement, be good to timeliness.\nOnly by not contending is one without blame.\n\nThus, to fill it is not as good as stopping.\nHammering it to a point cannot be long preserved.\nA hall filled with gold and jade cannot be guarded;\nwealth and honor with arrogance bring self-inflicted calamity.\nTo withdraw when the work is done—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nCarry the vital essence, embrace the One—\ncan one not depart from it?\nConcentrate the qi to attain suppleness—\ncan one be like an infant?\nPurify the profound mirror—\ncan one be without flaw?\nLove the people and govern the state—\ncan one be without knowledge?\nThe gates of Heaven open and close—\ncan one act as the female?\nUnderstanding the four directions—\ncan one be without knowledge?\n\nIt gives life, nurtures,\ngives life yet does not possess,\nacts yet does not rely,\ngrows yet does not govern—\nthis is called the mysterious virtue.\n\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nit is the space within that makes the cart useful.\nClay is shaped to form a vessel—\nit is the space within that makes the vessel useful.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room—\nit is the space within that makes the room useful.\n\nThus, the presence of things brings advantage,\nwhile their absence brings utility.\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe chase of hunting and racing maddens the heart,\nrare treasures distort conduct,\nthe five flavors dull the palate,\nthe five tones deafen the ears.\n\nTherefore, the sage governs for the belly, not for the eyes—\nthus, he discards the one and embraces the other.\nFavor and disgrace are like terror;\nregard great calamity as one’s own body.\nWhat does it mean, \"favor and disgrace are like terror\"?\nFavor is base—\ngained, it brings terror;\nlost, it brings terror.\nThis is what is meant by \"favor and disgrace are like terror.\"\nWhat does it mean, \"regard great calamity as one’s own body\"?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nis that I have a body.\nWhen I no longer have a body,\nwhat calamity could there be?\nThus, one who values the body as the world\nmay be entrusted with the world;\none who loves the body as the world\nmay be relied upon with the world.\n\nLook at it and it cannot be seen—\nit is called the Subtle.\nListen to it and it cannot be heard—\nit is called the Rare.\nGrasp it and it cannot be held—\nit is called the Elusive.\nThese three cannot be fully fathomed,\nthus they merge into the One.\nIts rising is not bright,\nits sinking is not dark.\nUnceasing, unnameable,\nit returns to nothingness—\nthis is called the formless form,\nthe image of nothingness.\nThis is called the Vague and Elusive.\nEncounter it and you do not see its front,\nfollow it and you do not see its back.\nHold to the ancient Dao to master present existence,\nto know the ancient beginning—\nthis is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe ancients who practiced the Dao\nwere subtle, mysterious, profound, and penetrating—\ntoo deep to be known.\nIt is only because they cannot be known\nthat I am forced to describe them:\nHesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;\ncautious, as if fearing all around;\nsolemn, as if a guest;\nyielding, as if ice about to melt;\nsimple, as if uncarved wood;\nhollow, as if a valley;\nopaque, as if turbid.\nWho can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?\nWho can rouse the still and gradually bring it to life?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness—\nonly because they do not desire fullness\nare they able to remain hidden and not be exhausted.\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nmaintain utter stillness.\nThe ten thousand things arise together,\nand I observe their return.\nAll things flourish,\neach returning to its root—\nthis is called stillness,\nand stillness is called returning to destiny.\nReturning to destiny is called constancy.\nKnowing constancy is called clarity.\nNot knowing constancy leads to recklessness and disaster.\nKnowing constancy is all-embracing,\nall-embracing is impartial,\nimpartial is kingly,\nkingly is heavenly,\nheavenly is the Dao,\nthe Dao is enduring—\nthough the body perishes, it is not destroyed.\n\nWhen the great Dao is abandoned,\nthen benevolence and righteousness appear.\nWhen wisdom and intelligence emerge,\nthen great hypocrisy arises.\nWhen the six relations are not in harmony,\nthen filial piety and kindness appear.\nWhen the state is in chaos and turmoil,\nthen loyal ministers emerge.\nCut off sagacity, discard knowledge,\nand the people will benefit a hundredfold.\nCut off benevolence, discard righteousness,\nand the people will return to filial piety and kindness.\nCut off skill, discard profit,\nand there will be no thieves or robbers.\nThese three sayings are not sufficient as teachings—\nthus, let them have something to belong to:\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nreduce self-interest, diminish desires.\nCut off learning, and there will be no worries.\nHow much difference is there between \"yes\" and \"ah\"?\nHow much difference is there between good and evil?\nWhat people fear cannot but be feared—\nhow vast and endless it is!\nThe multitude are joyous,\nas if partaking in a great feast,\nas if ascending a terrace in spring.\nI alone am tranquil, showing no sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet smiled.\nWeary, as if with nowhere to return.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nwhile I alone seem lacking.\nI have the heart of a fool—\nhow muddled!\nThe common people are bright,\nwhile I alone am dim.\nThe common people are discerning,\nwhile I alone am dull.\nVast, like the sea;\nceaseless, like the wind.\nThe multitude all have their use,\nwhile I alone am stubborn and rustic.\nI alone differ from others\nand value being nourished by the Mother.\n\nThe power of great virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe things of the Dao are vague and elusive—\nvague and elusive,\nyet within them is form;\nelusive and vague,\nyet within them is substance;\ndim and dark,\nyet within them is essence.\nThis essence is most real,\nand within it is trust.\nFrom ancient times until now,\nits name has never departed,\nthrough which we may see the beginning of all things.\nHow do I know the beginning of all things?\nBy this.\n\nThose who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm;\nthose who take long strides cannot walk far.\nThose who display themselves are not enlightened;\nthose who assert themselves are not distinguished;\nthose who boast of themselves have no merit;\nthose who are self-righteous do not endure.\nIn the Dao, these are called\n\"excessive food and superfluous conduct\"—\nthings that are detested.\nThus, those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.\nTo be bent is to be preserved whole;\nto be crooked is to be straightened;\nto be hollow is to be filled;\nto be worn is to be renewed;\nto have little is to gain;\nto have much is to be confused.\nTherefore, the sage embraces the One\nand becomes the shepherd of the world.\nHe does not display himself, thus he is enlightened;\nhe does not assert himself, thus he is distinguished;\nhe does not boast, thus he has merit;\nhe is not self-righteous, thus he endures.\nIt is only because he does not contend\nthat no one in the world can contend with him.\nThe ancient saying, \"To be bent is to be preserved whole\"—\nhow could it be empty words?\nTruly, to be preserved whole is to return to it.\n\nGentle winds do not last all morning;\nsudden rains do not last all day.\nWho is it that makes these?\nHeaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth cannot make things last,\nhow much less can man?\nThus, those who follow the Dao\nunite with the Dao;\nthose who follow virtue unite with virtue;\nthose who lose it unite with loss.\nThose who unite with virtue,\nthe Dao also unites with them;\nthose who unite with loss,\nthe Dao also unites with them.\n\nThere is a thing, chaotic yet complete,\nborn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and void,\nit stands alone and does not change.\nIt revolves without endangerment,\nand may be considered the mother of heaven and earth.\nI do not know its name—\nI style it \"Dao,\"\nand forcibly name it \"Great.\"\nGreat means passing,\npassing means far-reaching,\nfar-reaching means returning.\nThus, the Dao is great,\nheaven is great,\nearth is great,\nand the king is also great.\nWithin the realm, there are four greats,\nand the king occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nearth models itself on heaven,\nheaven models itself on the Dao,\nand the Dao models itself on nature.\n\nWeight is the root of lightness;\nstillness is the ruler of motion.\nThus, the noble person travels all day\nwithout leaving his heavy supplies.\nThough he may have splendid lodgings,\nhe remains tranquil and detached.\nHow could a ruler of ten thousand chariots\ntreat his own person lightly before the world?\nTo be light is to lose the root;\nto be hasty is to lose the ruler.\n\nGood traveling leaves no tracks;\ngood speech leaves no flaws;\ngood reckoning uses no counting rods;\ngood closure needs no bolt,\nyet cannot be opened;\ngood knotting needs no rope,\nyet cannot be untied.\nThus, the sage is always good at saving people,\nand so abandons no one;\nalways good at saving things,\nand so abandons nothing.\nThis is called following enlightenment.\nThus, the good person is the teacher of the not-good,\nand the not-good is the resource of the good.\nNot to value one’s teacher,\nnot to love one’s resource—\nthough knowledgeable, this is great delusion.\nThis is called the essential subtlety.\n\nKnow the masculine, keep to the feminine,\nand be the ravine of the world.\nBeing the ravine of the world,\nconstant virtue does not depart,\nand one returns to infancy.\nKnow the white, keep to the black,\nand be the pattern of the world.\nBeing the pattern of the world,\nconstant virtue does not err,\nand one returns to the limitless.\nKnow the glorious, keep to the humble,\nand be the valley of the world.\nBeing the valley of the world,\nconstant virtue is sufficient,\nand one returns to simplicity.\nWhen simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels;\nthe sage uses it and becomes the chief of officials.\nThus, the great system does not cut.\nDesiring to take the world,\none must act without action—\nfor the world is a sacred vessel.\n\nThat which cannot be acted upon—\nacting upon it brings ruin,\ngrasping it brings loss.\n\nThings may move or rest, may be warm or cool, may rise or fall.\nThus the sage discards excess, discards extravagance, discards extremes.\nThe Dao aids the ruler of men,\nnot by making the world strong through arms.\n\nWhere it passes,\nthorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great armies come years of famine.\nThe skilled achieve their aim and stop—\nthey do not dare to seize by force.\nHaving achieved their aim, they do not boast;\nhaving achieved their aim, they do not vaunt;\nhaving achieved their aim, they do not claim;\nhaving achieved their aim, they act as if compelled.\nThis is called achieving one’s aim without force.\nThings in their prime grow old—\nthis is called not following the Dao.\nThat which does not follow the Dao comes to an early end.\n\nWeapons are inauspicious tools,\nnot the tools of the noble person.\nThey are used only when unavoidable,\nand with utmost restraint.\nEven then, do not glorify them.\nTo glorify them is to delight in killing.\nThose who delight in killing\ncannot achieve their will in the world.\n\nThus, in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;\nin military affairs, the right is honored.\nTherefore, weapons are not the tools of the noble person—\nweapons are inauspicious tools.\nWhen unavoidable, they are used with restraint.\nSupreme is to regard them without beauty.\nIf one finds beauty in them, one delights in killing.\nThose who delight in killing\ncannot achieve their will in the world.\n\nThus, in felicitous affairs, the left is honored;\nin mourning rites, the right is honored.\nThe deputy general stands on the left,\nthe supreme general stands on the right—\nthis is to position them as if for mourning rites.\nWhen multitudes are killed,\none should weep with sorrow and grief.\nWhen victorious in battle,\none should observe mourning rites.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless and uncarved.\nThough it seems small,\nnone in the world dare claim dominion over it.\nIf lords and kings can hold to it,\nthe myriad things will submit of themselves.\nHeaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew,\nand the people, without decree, find balance.\n\nWhen the system of names begins,\nnames arise.\nOnce names exist, one must also know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop keeps one from peril.\nThe Dao in the world\nis like streams and valleys flowing to rivers and seas.\nTo know others is wisdom.\n\nThe one who knows oneself is enlightened.\nThe one who conquers others has strength,\nbut the one who conquers oneself is mighty.\nThe one who knows contentment is rich.\nThe one who persists with resolve has purpose.\nThe one who does not lose their place endures.\nThe one who dies yet is not forgotten lives long.\n\nThe Dao flows—ah!—it may be grasped to left or right.\nSuccess is achieved, affairs are settled,\nyet it does not claim possession.\nThe myriad things return to it,\nyet it does not act as master—\nthus it is ever without desire.\nIt may be called small,\nyet the myriad things return to it,\nand it does not act as master—\nit may be named great.\nTherefore, the sage’s ability to accomplish greatness\nlies in not asserting greatness,\nand so achieves greatness.\n\nHold to the great image, and all under heaven will come.\nThey come and are not harmed,\nbut find peace, great joy, and security.\nThus, when the Dao speaks,\nit says: insipid—ah!—its flavor is plain.\nLook at it, and it cannot be seen.\nListen to it, and it cannot be heard.\nUse it, and it cannot be exhausted.\n\nWhen you wish to contract something, first expand it.\nWhen you wish to weaken something, first strengthen it.\nWhen you wish to discard something, first exalt it.\nWhen you wish to seize something, first give it.\nThis is called subtle illumination:\nthe soft overcomes the hard.\nFish must not leave the deep;\nthe state’s sharp instruments must not be displayed.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\nIf lords and kings can hold to it,\nthe myriad things will transform of themselves.\nShould desire arise,\nI will restrain it with the uncarved block of nameless simplicity.\nThe uncarved block is not contending,\nand so will not be disgraced.\nThus, heaven and earth will right themselves.\n\n---\n\nThe Way: 2,426 characters (Mawangdui Silk Text, Version A, reconstructed)\n\n(Those of highest virtue do not act with virtue—thus they possess virtue.\nThose of lesser virtue do not lose virtue—thus they lack it.)\nThe highest virtue does not act (and has no purpose).\nThe highest benevolence acts (yet has no purpose).\nThe highest righteousness acts (and has a purpose).\nThe highest propriety acts (and none respond,\nso they roll up their sleeves and force compliance).\n\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows.\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence follows.\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows.\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety follows.\nPropriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nand the beginning of chaos.\nForesight is the flower of the Dao,\nand the beginning of folly.\n\nTherefore, the great person dwells in the substantial, not the superficial;\nin the fruit, not the flower.\nThus, they discard the latter and take the former.\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear.\nEarth attained the One and became stable.\nSpirits attained the One and became efficacious.\nValleys attained the One and became full.\nLords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.\nThis is how it comes to be.\n\nIf heaven were not clear, it would fear cracking.\nIf earth were not stable, it would fear erupting.\nIf spirits were not efficacious, they would fear dissipating.\nIf valleys were not full, they would fear drying.\nIf lords and kings were not noble and exalted, they would fear toppling.\n\nThus, nobility must have humility as its root.\nExaltation must have lowliness as its foundation.\nTherefore, lords and kings call themselves \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" \"the destitute.\"\nIs this not taking humility as their root?\nIs it not so?\n\nThus, excessive praise leads to no praise.\nTherefore, one does not desire to gleam like jade\nor clatter like stone.\n\nThe superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it.\nThe middling person hears the Dao and wavers between belief and doubt.\nThe inferior person hears the Dao and laughs loudly.\nIf it were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao.\n\nThus, the established saying goes:\nThe bright Dao seems dim.\nThe advancing Dao seems to retreat.\nThe level Dao seems uneven.\nHighest virtue seems like a valley.\nGreat purity seems sullied.\nVast virtue seems insufficient.\nEstablished virtue seems inert.\nTrue substance seems fickle.\nThe great square has no corners.\nThe great vessel is late in completion.\nThe great tone has a rare sound.\nThe great image has no form.\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao is good at beginning and good at completion.\nIn reversal lies the movement of the Dao.\nIn weakness lies its strength.\n\nThe function of the Dao is thus:\nAll things under heaven arise from Being,\nand Being arises from Non-being.\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\nthe One gives birth to the Two,\nthe Two gives birth to the Three,\nthe Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nand through the blending of qi they achieve harmony.\n\nWhat all under heaven detest are the orphaned, the widowed, and the destitute,\nyet kings and lords style themselves by these names.\nThus, things may be diminished by being increased,\nor increased by being diminished.\n\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n\"The violent do not die a natural death.\"\nI shall take this as the father of my teaching.\n\nThe softest under heaven rides roughshod over the hardest.\nThat which has no substance enters where there is no gap.\nThrough this I know the benefit of non-action.\nFew under heaven can match the teaching without words\nand the benefit of non-action.\n\nWhich is dearer, fame or the self?\nWhich is greater, the self or wealth?\nWhich is more harmful, gain or loss?\n\nExcessive love must lead to great expenditure,\nand hoarding must lead to heavy loss.\nThus, one who knows contentment is not disgraced,\none who knows when to stop is not endangered,\nand can long endure.\n\nGreat perfection seems flawed, yet its use is unimpaired.\nGreat fullness seems empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat straightness seems bent,\ngreat skill seems clumsy,\ngreat eloquence seems halting.\n\nMovement overcomes cold,\nstillness overcomes heat.\nPurity and tranquility set the standard for all under heaven.\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao,\nwarhorses are retired to fertilize the fields.\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nmares give birth on the battlefield.\n\nNo misfortune is greater than not knowing contentment,\nno calamity is greater than covetousness,\nno fault is greater than desire for gain.\nThus, contentment that knows contentment is always content.\n\nWithout stepping outside one’s door, one can know all under heaven.\nWithout looking out the window, one can see the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nTherefore, the sage knows without traveling,\nunderstands without seeing,\nand accomplishes without acting.\n\nIn learning, one daily accumulates.\nIn following the Dao, one daily diminishes,\ndiminishes and further diminishes,\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nTo take all under heaven is always a matter of non-interference.\nWhen one is compelled to act,\nit is insufficient to take all under heaven.\n\nThe sage always takes the heart of the people as his own.\nThose who are good, he treats as good.\nThose who are not good, he also treats as good—thus attaining goodness.\nThose who are trustworthy, he trusts.\nThose who are untrustworthy, he also trusts—thus attaining trustworthiness.\n\nThe sage’s presence in the world is unassuming,\nblending the hearts of all under heaven.\nThe people all turn their ears and eyes to him,\nand the sage treats them all as children.\n\nMen are born and enter life;\nlife leads to death.\nOf ten, three are companions of life,\nthree are companions of death,\nand three—though living—move toward death.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they cling too tightly to life.\n\nI have heard that one who is skilled in preserving life\nwalks through the wilds without avoiding rhinoceros or tiger,\nenters battle without armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger finds no place to sink its claws,\nthe weapon finds no place to pierce its blade.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no place of death in him.\n\nThe Dao gives them life,\nvirtue nurtures them,\nmatter shapes them,\nand circumstances complete them.\nThus, the myriad things honor the Dao and value virtue.\nThe honor of the Dao and the value of virtue\nare not bestowed but always arise naturally.\n\nThe Dao gives them life, nurtures them,\nraises them, matures them,\nripens them, sustains them,\nshelters and protects them.\nIt gives life yet does not possess,\nacts yet does not claim,\nleads yet does not dominate.\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\nThis is called profound virtue.\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich may be considered the mother of the world.\nOnce one attains the mother,\none may thereby know her children.\nOnce one knows the children,\none returns to guard the mother,\nand to the end of life there is no danger.\nBlock its openings,\nshut its gates,\nand to the end of life there is no toil.\nOpen its openings,\nassist its affairs,\nand to the end of life there is no remedy.\n\nSeeing the small is called clarity,\nguarding the soft is called strength.\nUsing its light,\none returns to its clarity,\nleaving no disaster to the self.\nThis is called following the constant.\n\nIf I had knowledge,\nwalking the great Dao,\nonly its byways would I fear.\nThe great Dao is very level,\nyet the people prefer shortcuts.\nThe court is very well ordered,\nyet the fields are very weedy,\nand the granaries are very empty.\nThey wear embroidered robes,\ncarry sharp swords,\nsurfeit themselves with food and drink,\nand possess wealth in excess.\nThis is called the boasting of thieves—\nthieves indeed, not the Dao.\n\nWhat is well established cannot be uprooted,\nwhat is well embraced cannot slip away.\nThus, descendants will continue the ancestral sacrifices without end.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;\ncultivate it in the family, and its virtue is abundant;\ncultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;\ncultivate it in the state, and its virtue prospers;\ncultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.\n\nTherefore, observe the self through the self,\nobserve the family through the family,\nobserve the village through the village,\nobserve the state through the state,\nobserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is so?\nBy this.\n\nOne whose virtue is profound\nis like an infant:\nwasps and scorpions do not sting him,\nwild beasts do not seize him,\nbirds of prey do not strike him.\nHis bones are weak, his sinews soft,\nyet his grasp is firm.\nHe does not yet know the union of male and female,\nyet his organ stirs—\nsuch is the perfection of his essence.\nHe may cry all day without growing hoarse—\nsuch is the perfection of his harmony.\n\nKnowing harmony is called the constant,\nknowing the constant is called clarity.\nIncreasing life is called auspicious,\nthe heart directing qi is called strength.\nWhen things are strong, they grow old—\nthis is called not the Dao.\nWhat is not the Dao ends early.\n\nBlock its openings,\nshut its gates,\nblunt its sharpness,\nuntie its tangles,\nsoften its light,\nmerge with its dust—\nthis is called mysterious sameness.\nThus, one cannot be too close,\nnor too distant;\ncannot be benefited,\nnor harmed;\ncannot be valued,\nnor despised.\nTherefore, it is honored under heaven.\n\nGovern the state with uprightness,\nuse the military with surprise,\ntake the world with non-interference.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nThe more taboos there are in the world,\nthe poorer the people;\nthe more sharp weapons the people have,\nthe more troubled the state and the family;\nthe more cunning the people,\nthe more strange things arise;\nthe more laws and decrees are displayed,\nthe more thieves and bandits there are.\nTherefore, the sage says:\nI take no action, and the people transform themselves;\nI love tranquility, and the people right themselves;\nI engage in no activity, and the people enrich themselves;\nI desire not to desire, and the people of themselves become simple.\n\nWhen the people lack simplicity,\nexamine the state—\ncalamity and fortune depend on each other.\nWho knows their limit?\nThere is no uprightness.\nUprightness reverts to strangeness,\ngoodness reverts to evil—\nthe people’s delusion has indeed lasted long.\n\nTherefore, the square is without corners,\nthe sharp is without blade,\nthe straight is without constraint,\nthe bright is without dazzle.\nIn governing people and serving heaven,\nnothing is better than frugality.\nOnly through frugality can one be prepared early—\nthis is called accumulating virtue.\nAccumulating virtue means there is nothing one cannot overcome;\nwhen there is nothing one cannot overcome,\nno one knows one’s limit.\nWhen no one knows one’s limit,\none can possess the state.\nPossessing the mother of the state,\none can endure long—\nthis is called deep roots and firm foundation,\nthe Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the Dao is established under heaven,\nits ghosts do not haunt.\nNot that its ghosts do not haunt,\nbut their haunting does not harm people.\n\nNot that their haunting does not harm people—\nthe sage likewise does no harm.\nAs the two do not harm one another,\nvirtue and power converge in this.\nA great state is the lower reaches,\nthe female of all under heaven,\nthe confluence of all under heaven.\nThe female ever overcomes the male through stillness—\nfor her stillness.\nThus it is fitting for the great state to lower itself before the small;\nby lowering itself before the small state, it wins the small state.\nBy lowering itself before the great state, it is won by the great state.\nThus some lower themselves to win,\nsome lower themselves and are won.\nThe great state desires only to unite and nurture others;\nthe small state desires only to enter and serve others.\nWhen both attain their desire,\nthe greater must lower itself.\n\nThe Dao is the convergence of the ten thousand things,\nthe refuge of the good,\nthe shelter of the not-good.\nFine words can purchase honor,\nnoble conduct can exalt others—\nwhy then reject those who are not good?\nThus, when the Son of Heaven is established and the three ministers appointed,\nthough one may offer a jade disc preceded by a team of four horses,\nit is not as good as sitting to present this teaching.\nWhat is the reason the ancients prized this?\nIs it not said: \"Through seeking, one attains;\nthrough guilt, one is freed\"?\nTherefore, it is honored under heaven.\nIn acting, act without striving;\nin affairs, taste without savor.\nWhether great or small, many or few,\nrepay enmity with virtue.\nResolve difficulties while they are easy;\nachieve the great while it is small.\n\nThe great in the world arises from the small;\nthe difficult in the world arises from the easy.\nTherefore, the sage never attempts the great,\nand thus accomplishes greatness.\n\nWhoever is sparing in trust will meet with many difficulties—\nthus the sage, ever mindful of difficulty,\nremains ever at ease.\n\nWhat is easy to hold is easily maintained;\nwhat is not yet sprouted is easily planned;\nwhat is fragile is easily shattered;\nwhat is minute is easily scattered.\nAct before it comes to be;\ngovern before disorder arises.\n\nA tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tender shoot;\na nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth;\na journey of a hundred *ren* begins beneath one’s feet.\n\nWhoever acts, fails;\nwhoever grasps, loses.\nTherefore, the sage does not act, and so does not fail;\ndoes not grasp, and so does not lose.\n\nIn their undertakings, people often falter at the point of completion—\nthus, if one is as careful at the end as at the beginning,\nthere will be no failure.\n\nTherefore, the sage desires what others do not desire,\nand does not prize goods hard to obtain;\nlearns what others do not learn,\nand returns to what the multitude has passed over.\nThus, he can assist the ten thousand things in their natural course,\nyet dares not act.\n\nHence it is said:\nThose who follow the Dao do not enlighten the people,\nbut rather seek to make them simple.\nThe people are difficult to govern.\n\nWith such knowledge,\nit becomes the bane of the state;\nwith such unknowing,\nit becomes the state’s virtue.\nEver knowing these two is also a model—\never knowing this model is called profound virtue,\ndeep and far-reaching,\nturning back with things,\nthen attaining great compliance.\n\nThus, the reason the rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys\nis that they excel in staying low—\ntherefore, they can be kings of the hundred valleys.\n\nFor this reason, when the sage desires to be above the people,\nhe must place his words below them;\nwhen he desires to lead the people,\nhe must place himself behind them.\nThus, though he dwells ahead, the people do not harm him;\nthough he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome.\nThe world delights in him and does not grow weary—\nnot because he does not contend,\nand so the world cannot contend with him.\n\nLet a small state have few people—\nlet it have tools for ten or a hundred yet not use them;\nlet it make the people value life and not journey far.\nThough there be boats and carriages, none to ride them;\nthough there be armor and weapons, none to display them.\nLet the people return to knotting cords and using them.\nLet them find their food sweet,\ntheir clothing beautiful,\ntheir customs joyful,\ntheir dwellings secure.\nThough neighboring states are within sight of one another,\nthe sounds of their chickens and dogs heard,\nthe people may grow old and die without ever visiting one another.\n\nTrue words are not fine;\nfine words are not true.\nThe knowing are not learned;\nthe learned are not knowing.\nThe good are not excessive;\nthe excessive are not good.\nThe sage does not accumulate—\nthe more he has for others, the more he possesses;\nthe more he gives to others, the more he has.\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm;\nthe Dao of Man acts yet does not contend.\nThe world all calls me great—\nyet I seem not so.\nIt is precisely because I am great that I seem not so;\nif I seemed so, I would long since have been small.\n\nI ever hold to three treasures, of which I guard one:\nthe first is compassion;\nthe second, frugality;\nthe third, not daring to be first in the world.\nWith compassion, one can be brave;\nwith frugality, one can be expansive;\nnot daring to be first in the world,\none can become the leader of completed affairs.\nNow, to abandon compassion yet seek bravery,\nto abandon frugality yet seek expansion,\nto abandon the last yet seek the first—\nthis is certain death.\n\nFor compassion in battle brings victory;\nin defense, it brings firmness.\nHeaven, when about to establish one,\nfortifies him with compassion.\nThe good warrior is not bellicose;\nthe good fighter is not enraged;\nthe good conqueror does not engage the enemy;\nthe good employer of men acts humbly.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention;\nthis is called employing men;\nthis is called matching Heaven—\nthe ultimate of antiquity.\n\nThere are words in the use of arms:\n“I dare not be the host, but rather the guest;\nI dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.”\nThis is called marching without marching,\nraising the arm without raising the arm,\nseizing without seizing,\nfighting without fighting.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy—\nunderestimating the enemy risks losing my treasures.\nThus, when evenly matched armies meet,\nthe grieving side prevails.\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice.\n\nYet none among men can know them,\nnone can practice them.\nWords have their lord, affairs have their origin—\nonly the Dao knows them.\nThus, those who know me are few,\nand I am thereby noble.\n\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth\nyet holds jade within.\nTo know yet seem not to know is excellence;\nnot to know yet claim to know is sickness.\nThe sage is not sick\nbecause he recognizes this sickness as sickness—\nthus he is not sick.\n\nWhen the people do not fear what is fearful,\nthen great fear will come.\nDo not restrict their dwelling,\ndo not oppress their livelihood.\nOnly by not oppressing them\ncan one avoid oppression.\n\nThus the sage knows himself\nbut does not display himself;\nloves himself\nbut does not exalt himself.\nTherefore he discards the one\nand embraces the other.\n\nTo be bold in daring leads to death;\nto be bold in not daring leads to life.\nOf these two, one brings benefit, one brings harm—\nwho knows the reason for what Heaven abhors?\nThe Dao of Heaven\ndoes not contend yet excels in victory,\ndoes not speak yet excels in response,\ndoes not summon yet comes of itself,\nis unhurried yet excels in planning.\n\nThe net of Heaven is vast, vast,\nits mesh never fails.\n\nIf the people constantly do not fear death,\nhow can one use killing to threaten them?\nIf the people constantly fear death,\nthen for those who act perversely,\nI will seize and kill them—\nwho would dare?\n\nIf the people must constantly fear death,\nthen there is always an executioner.\nTo kill in place of the executioner\nis like hewing in place of the master carpenter—\nfew who hew in place of the master carpenter\ndo not injure their own hands.\n\nThe people suffer hunger\nbecause their rulers consume too much in taxes.\n\nThus, the people’s disorder\narises from their superiors’ having something to do—\nthus their disorder.\nThe people’s early death\narises from their seeking life too lavishly—\nthus their early death.\nOnly those who take life lightly\nare worthy of valuing life.\nThe life of humans:\nsoft and weak in life,\nstiff and hard in death.\nThe life of the myriad things—plants and trees:\nsoft and fragile in life,\nwithered and brittle in death.\nTherefore it is said:\nthe hard and strong are companions of death,\nthe soft and weak, the subtle and fine, companions of life.\nWhen weapons are strong, they do not prevail;\nwhen wood is strong, it is felled.\nThe great and strong dwell below,\nthe soft and weak, the subtle and fine, dwell above.\nThe Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow:\nthe high is pressed down, the low is raised up,\nthe excessive is reduced, the deficient is supplemented.\nThus the Dao of Heaven\nreduces the excessive to supplement the deficient.\nThe Dao of humans is not so—\nit reduces the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can have excess and yet offer it to Heaven?\nOnly one who embodies the Dao.\nTherefore the sage acts yet does not possess,\nachieves success yet does not dwell in it.\nIn this way, he does not wish to display worthiness.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nyet in attacking the hard and strong,\nnothing can surpass it—\nfor nothing can replace it.\nThat the weak overcomes the strong,\nthe soft overcomes the hard,\nnone in the world does not know,\nyet none can practice it.\nThus the sage’s words say:\n“To receive the state’s disgrace\nis called master of the altars of soil and grain;\nto receive the state’s misfortune\nis called king of all under Heaven.”\nStraight words seem reversed.\nHarmonizing great resentment\nmust leave some resentment behind—\nhow can this be considered good?\nTherefore the sage holds to the left tally\nyet does not demand from others.\nThus those with virtue oversee the tally,\nthose without virtue oversee the levies.\nThe Dao of Heaven shows no partiality,\nyet it constantly bestows on the good.\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;\nthe name that can be named is not the constant name.\n\nThe nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things;\nthe named is the mother of the ten thousand things.\nThus, constantly without desire,\none observes its subtleties;\nconstantly with desire,\none observes its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet are differently named.\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and more profound,\nthe gateway to all subtleties.\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nugliness is already known;\nwhen all know good as good,\nnot-good is already known.\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\ndifficult and easy complete each other,\nlong and short shape each other,\nhigh and low fill each other,\nnote and voice harmonize with each other,\nbefore and after follow each other—\nthis is constant.\n\nTherefore, the sage abides in non-action,\npractices the teaching without words,\nand lets the ten thousand things rise without initiating them.\nHe acts without claiming,\nsucceeds without dwelling.\nOnly because he does not dwell\ndoes it not leave him.\n\nNot exalting the worthy\nprevents the people from contending;\nnot prizing rare goods\nprevents the people from stealing;\nnot displaying what is desirable\nprevents the people from being disordered.\nThus, the sage’s governance:\nempties their minds,\nfills their bellies,\nweakens their ambitions,\nstrengthens their bones,\nconstantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire.\nHe ensures that the knowledgeable dare not act—\nthen there is nothing ungoverned.\n\nThe Dao is empty yet in use is never filled.\nVast and deep, it is the ancestor of the ten thousand things.\nIt blunts sharpness,\nuntangles knots,\nsoftens glare,\nunites with the dust.\nSubmerged and still, it seems to exist.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit resembles the ancestor of the gods.\n\nHeaven and earth are not humane;\nthey treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not humane;\nhe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe space between heaven and earth—\nis it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nthe more it moves, the more it produces.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to guard the center.\n\nThe spirit of the valley never dies;\nthis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gateway of the mysterious female\nis called the root of heaven and earth.\nSubtle and continuous, it seems to exist;\nin use, it is never exhausted.\n\nThe highest good is like water.\nWater benefits the ten thousand things yet contends not;\nit flows in places all others disdain—\nthus it is near the Dao.\nIn dwelling, be close to the earth;\nin heart, be deep;\nin giving, be true;\nin governance, be just;\nin service, be capable;\nin action, be timely.\nOnly by not contending\ncan one be free from blame.\n\nDo not fill it to the brim—\nbetter to stop in time.\nHammer and sharpen a blade,\nyet it cannot be long preserved.\nGold and jade fill the hall—\nnone can guard them.\nWealth and honor breed arrogance,\nbringing misfortune upon oneself.\nWithdraw when the work is done—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nCarrying your spirit and embracing the One,\ncan you never depart from it?\nConcentrating your qi to attain softness,\ncan you be like a newborn?\nPurifying your profound vision,\ncan you be without flaw?\nLoving the people and governing the state,\ncan you do so without knowledge?\nThe gates of Heaven open and close—\ncan you play the female?\nUnderstanding all directions,\ncan you do so without action?\n\nGiving birth and nourishing,\ngiving birth yet not possessing,\nacting yet not claiming,\nleading yet not dominating—\nthis is called profound virtue.\n\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nit is the nothing within that makes the cart useful.\nClay is shaped into a vessel—\nit is the nothing within that makes the vessel useful.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room—\nit is the nothing within that makes the room useful.\nThus, being provides the advantage,\nnothing provides the use.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes;\ngalloping and hunting madden the mind;\nrare goods hinder conduct;\nthe five flavors dull the palate;\nthe five tones deafen the ears.\nThus, the sage’s governance:\nacts for the belly, not for the eyes—\ntherefore, he discards the latter and takes the former.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis is called disgrace as if alarmed, valuing great calamity as one’s own body—what is called disgrace as if alarmed?\nThat which is called disgrace as if alarmed:\nto gain it is as if alarmed, to lose it is as if alarmed—\nthis is called disgrace as if alarmed.\nWhy is it called valuing great calamity as one’s own body?\nThe reason I have great calamity is that I have a body;\nif I were without a body, what calamity could I have?\nThus, one who values the body as the world may be entrusted with the world;\none who loves the body as the world may be given charge of the world.\n\nLook at it and it cannot be seen—it is called the Subtle;\nlisten to it and it cannot be heard—it is called the Rare;\ngrasp it and it cannot be held—it is called the Elusive.\nThese three cannot be fully fathomed,\nso they merge into one.\nIts rising brings no light,\nits setting brings no darkness.\nEndless, unnameable,\nit returns to nothingness—\nthis is called the form of the formless,\nthe image of nothingness.\nThis is called the elusive and evanescent,\nmeeting it, one does not see its head;\nfollowing it, one does not see its rear.\nHold to the Dao of the present to master what is present,\nand thus know the ancient beginning—\nthis is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nOf old, those skilled in the Dao were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating,\ntoo deep to be known.\nIt is only because they cannot be known\nthat I am compelled to describe their appearance:\nHesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;\ncautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;\nrespectful, as if a guest;\ndissolving, as if ice melting;\nsimple, as if uncarved wood;\nhollow, as if a valley;\nopaque, as if turbid.\nWho can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?\nWho can rouse the still and gradually bring it to life?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\nOnly because they do not desire fullness\nare they able to be worn yet not newly made.\n\nAll things arise side by side,\nand I observe their return.\nAll things flourish in abundance,\neach returning to its root—\nthis is called stillness.\nStillness is called returning to destiny;\nreturning to destiny is called the constant.\nKnowing the constant is called illumination.\nNot knowing the constant leads to recklessness and disaster.\nKnowing the constant allows for acceptance;\nacceptance leads to impartiality;\nimpartiality leads to kingship;\nkingship leads to heaven;\nheaven leads to the Dao;\nthe Dao leads to enduring—\none’s body may perish, but one does not come to great harm.\n\nIn highest antiquity, the people knew only that rulers existed;\nnext, they loved and praised them;\nnext, they feared them;\nnext, they despised them.\nWhen trust is insufficient, distrust arises.\nHow careful they were with their words!\nWhen tasks were accomplished and affairs completed,\nthe people all said, “We are naturally so.”\n\nWhen the great Dao declined, benevolence and righteousness arose;\nwhen knowledge and wisdom emerged, great hypocrisy followed;\nwhen the six relations fell into disharmony, filial piety and kindness appeared;\nwhen the state and family fell into chaos, loyal ministers emerged.\n\nCut off sageness, discard knowledge, and the people will benefit a hundredfold;\ncut off benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness;\ncut off skill, discard profit, and thieves and robbers will disappear.\nThese three sayings, as teachings, are not sufficient—\ntherefore, let them have something to which they belong:\nmanifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nreduce self-interest, diminish desires.\nCut off learning, and there will be no worries.\n\nHow far apart are “only this” and “how much more”?\nHow far apart are beauty and ugliness?\nWhat others fear, one must not fail to fear—\nhow vast, how endless!\nThe people all rejoice as if feasting at the Great Sacrifice,\nas if ascending the springtime terrace.\nI alone remain unmoved, like an infant who has not yet smiled,\nweary, as if with nowhere to return.\nThe people all have more than enough,\nwhile I alone seem bereft.\nI have the mind of a fool—how muddled!\nThe common people are bright,\nwhile I alone am dim.\nThe common people are discerning,\nwhile I alone am dull.\nBoundless, like the sea,\nceaseless, like the ceaseless wind—\nthe people all have their uses,\nwhile I alone am stubborn and rustic.\nI alone differ from others\nand value being nourished by the Mother.\n\nThe power of the profoundest virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe things of the Dao are elusive and evanescent—\nelusive, evanescent,\nyet within them are images;\nevanescent, elusive,\nyet within them are entities;\nprofound, obscure,\nyet within them is essence.\nThis essence is most genuine,\nand within it is trust.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nits name has never departed,\nby which we may observe the origins of all things.\nHow do I know the nature of these origins?\nBy this.\n\nThat which does not stand on tiptoe is firm;\nthat which does not peer ahead is bright;\nthat which does not boast of itself achieves merit;\nthat which does not praise itself endures.\nIt is only because it does not contend\nthat nothing in the world can contend with it.\nThe ancient saying, “That which is bent will be preserved whole,”\nhow could it be empty words?\nTruly, it will be preserved and return to wholeness.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One;\nthe One gives birth to two;\ntwo gives birth to three;\nthree gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nblending their qi to attain harmony.\nWhat people dislike is to be orphaned, widowed, or destitute,\nyet kings and lords call themselves by these names.\nThus, things may be diminished yet thereby increased,\nor increased yet thereby diminished.\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n“A violent man does not die a natural death.”\nI will make this the father of my teaching.\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light;\nthe still is the ruler of the restless.\nThus, the noble person travels all day without leaving the heavy supplies.\nThough there may be splendid sights,\nthey remain calmly detached.\nHow could a lord of ten thousand chariots\ntreat his own person lightly in the world?\nIf he treats it lightly, he loses the root;\nif he is restless, he loses the ruler.\n\nA good traveler leaves no tracks;\na good speaker makes no slips;\na good reckoner uses no tallies;\na good closer needs no bolts, yet none can open;\na good binder needs no cords, yet none can loosen.\nThus, the sage is always good at saving people,\nand so abandons no one;\nalways good at saving things,\nand so abandons nothing—\nthis is called inheriting illumination.\nTherefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good;\nthe not-good is the resource of the good.\nNot to value one’s teacher,\nnot to love one’s resource—\nthough knowledgeable, this is great delusion.\nThis is called the essential subtlety.\n\nHe who does not value his teacher,\nnor cherish his resource—\nthough wise, this is called profound delusion.\n\nKnow the masculine, hold to the feminine,\nto be the world’s stream—\nconstant virtue never departs,\nreturning to the state of infancy.\n\nKnow the white, hold to the blackened,\nto be the world’s model—\nconstant virtue never errs,\nreturning to the boundless.\n\nKnow the honorable, hold to the humble,\nto be the world’s pattern—\nconstant virtue never fails,\nreturning to simplicity.\nScattered, it becomes vessels;\nthe sage employs it as chief and elder.\nFor great governance requires no carving.\n\nThose who would seize the world and act upon it,\nI see they will not succeed.\nThe world is a sacred vessel,\nnot something to be acted upon.\nWho acts upon it, fails;\nwho grasps it, loses.\n\nThings may advance or follow,\nblow hot or blow cold,\nbe strong or be weak,\nbe laden or be empty.\nThus the sage discards excess,\ndiscards extravagance,\ndiscards extravagance.\n\nTo guide a ruler with the Dao,\ndo not dominate the world with force.\nSuch affairs tend to rebound.\nWhere armies camp, thorns grow.\nAfter great wars, lean years follow.\n\nThe good commander achieves his aim and stops,\nnot daring to take by force.\nHe achieves his aim but does not boast,\nachieves his aim but does not vaunt,\nachieves his aim but does not exult,\nachieves his aim only as a last resort.\nThis is called achieving one’s aim without force.\n\nThings flourish then age—\nthis is called not following the Dao.\nWhat does not follow the Dao soon ends.\n\nWeapons are ill-omened tools,\nloathed by all things.\nThus one who has the Dao does not dwell with them.\nThe noble person at home honors the left;\nin war, honors the right.\nWeapons are not the tools of the noble,\nthey are ill-omened tools,\nused only when unavoidable.\nIt is best to remain tranquil;\ndo not glorify them.\nTo glorify them is to delight in killing.\nOne who delights in killing\ncannot achieve his will in the world.\n\nThus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;\nin mourning, the right is honored.\nThe lieutenant general stands on the left,\nthe supreme general on the right—\nthis means they are positioned as in mourning rites.\nWhen many are killed, one should mourn with sorrow.\nWhen victorious in battle, observe mourning rites.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\nThough small, none in the world dare subjugate it.\nIf lords and kings can hold to it,\nthe ten thousand things will submit of themselves.\nHeaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew,\nand the people, without command, find harmony.\n\nWhen the system of names begins,\nnames arise.\nOnce names exist,\nknow when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop averts danger.\nThe Dao in the world\nis like streams flowing to rivers and seas.\n\nTo know others is wisdom;\nto know oneself is illumination.\n\nHe who conquers others possesses strength;\nhe who conquers himself is mighty.\nHe who knows contentment is rich;\nhe who persists with resolve has purpose.\nHe who does not lose his place endures;\nhe who does not forget in death lives long.\n\nThe Dao—ah, how it may be grasped to left or right!\nIts work accomplished, its affairs completed,\nyet it claims no possession.\nThe ten thousand things return to it,\nyet it does not act as master—\never without desire,\nit may be called small.\nThe ten thousand things return to it,\nyet it does not act as master—\nit may be called great.\nThus the sage’s power to achieve greatness\nlies in never acting great,\nand so achieves greatness.\n\nHold to the great image,\nand all under heaven will come—\ncoming without harm,\nsecure, peaceful, and greatly at ease.\nMusic and fine food\nmay make the passing traveler pause,\nbut the Dao when spoken\nis so bland—ah, how insipid!\nLook for it, yet nothing is seen;\nlisten for it, yet nothing is heard;\nuse it, yet it cannot be exhausted.\n\nShould you wish to gather it, you must first expand it;\nshould you wish to weaken it, you must first strengthen it;\nshould you wish to discard it, you must first promote it;\nshould you wish to seize it, you must first give it—\nthis is called subtle illumination.\nThe soft overcomes the hard.\nFish must not leave the deep;\nthe state’s sharpest tools must not be displayed to others.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\nIf lords and kings can hold to it,\nthe ten thousand things will submit of themselves.\nShould desire arise, I shall press it down\nwith the simplicity of the nameless—\nthe nameless, ah, so unadorned!\nWith it, the world will settle of itself.\n\nThe *Upper Power* does not act powerfully, yet possesses power;\nthe *Lower Power* does not lose power, yet lacks power.\nThe *Upper Power* acts without deliberate action;\nthe *Upper Benevolence* acts without deliberate action;\nthe *Upper Righteousness* acts with deliberate action;\nthe *Upper Ritual* acts, yet none respond—\nthen one rolls up one’s sleeves and forces compliance.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, power arises;\nwhen power is lost, benevolence arises;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises.\nRitual is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nthe beginning of disorder.\nForeknowledge is the flower of the Dao,\nthe beginning of folly.\nTherefore the great man dwells in the thick, not the thin;\nin the fruit, not the flower.\nThus he discards the latter and takes the former.\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became stable;\nthe spirits attained the One and became efficacious;\nthe valleys attained the One and became full;\nthe lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven—\nthis was their perfection.\nIf Heaven were not clear, it would fear to split;\nif Earth were not stable, it would fear to erupt;\nif the spirits were not efficacious, they would fear to dissipate;\nif the valleys were not full, they would fear to dry up;\nif lords and kings were not noble and exalted, they would fear to topple.\nThus the noble must have the lowly as its root;\nthe high must have the low as its foundation.\nTherefore lords and kings call themselves \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"destitute\"—\nis this not taking the lowly as their root? Is it not?\nThus the highest renown is no renown.\nTherefore do not desire to gleam like jade,\nbut be unyielding like stone.\n\nThe superior scholar, hearing the Dao, earnestly practices it;\nthe middling scholar, hearing the Dao, seems to keep it, seems to lose it;\nthe inferior scholar, hearing the Dao, laughs loudly—\nif not laughed at, it would not suffice as the Dao.\nThus the established sayings have it:\nThe bright Dao seems dim;\nthe advancing Dao seems to retreat;\nthe level Dao seems uneven.\nThe Upper Power seems like a valley;\ngreat whiteness seems sullied;\nbroad power seems insufficient;\nestablished power seems flimsy;\ntrue substance seems malleable.\nThe great square has no corners;\nthe great vessel is late in completion;\nthe great tone has a faint sound;\nthe great image has no form.\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\nOnly the Dao is good at beginning and good at completion.\n\nReturning is the movement of the Dao;\nweakness is the function of the Dao.\n\nHeaven and earth’s myriad things are born from Being;\nBeing is born from Nonbeing.\nThe Dao gives birth to the One;\nthe One gives birth to the Two;\nthe Two gives birth to the Three;\nthe Three gives birth to the ten thousand things.\nThe ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang,\nblending their qi to attain harmony.\n\nWhat people despise—\nbeing orphaned, widowed, or unworthy—\nkings and lords use as their titles.\nThus, some things are diminished yet gain,\nwhile others are increased yet lose.\nWhat people teach,\nI too teach:\n“A violent man does not die a natural death.”\nI will take this as the father of my teaching.\n\nThe softest under heaven\ngallops through the hardest under heaven.\nNonbeing enters where there is no space.\nThus I know the benefit of nonaction.\nTeaching without words,\nbenefit without action—\nfew under heaven can attain this.\n\nWhich is dearer, name or self?\nWhich is greater, self or wealth?\nWhich is more harmful, gain or loss?\nExcessive love incurs great cost;\nhoarding much invites heavy loss.\nKnow contentment and avoid disgrace;\nknow restraint and avoid danger—\nthus can one endure long.\n\nGreat accomplishment seems incomplete,\nyet its use is never exhausted.\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nyet its use is never depleted.\nGreat straightness seems bent;\ngreat skill seems clumsy;\ngreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\nMovement overcomes cold;\nstillness overcomes heat.\nPurity and tranquility set the world right.\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao,\nwarhorses are retired to fertilize fields.\nWhen the world loses the Dao,\nmares give birth on the battlefield.\nNo crime is greater than indulging desire;\nno disaster is greater than discontent;\nno fault is greater than covetousness.\nThus, knowing contentment’s contentment\nis ever content.\n\nWithout stepping outside one’s door,\none may know the world.\nWithout peering through one’s window,\none may know the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\nTherefore the sage knows without traveling,\nnames without seeing,\ncompletes without acting.\n\nScholars daily accumulate;\nthose who hear the Dao daily diminish.\nDiminish and further diminish,\nuntil reaching nonaction.\nThrough nonaction,\nnothing is left undone.\nTo take the world,\none must always act without contrivance.\nWith contrivance,\none is not fit to take the world.\n\nThe sage always takes the heart of the common people as his heart.\nThose who are good, I treat as good;\nthose who are not good, I also treat as good—\nthus attaining goodness.\nThose who are trustworthy, I trust;\nthose who are untrustworthy, I also trust—\nthus attaining trustworthiness.\nThe sage in the world\nblends his heart with all under heaven.\nAll people fix their ears and eyes upon him,\nand the sage treats them as children.\n\nBirth and death:\nthirteen parts belong to life,\nthirteen parts belong to death.\nYet people’s lives all lead to death’s realm—\nthirteen parts again.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they cling to life too tightly.\n\nI have heard that one who skillfully preserves life\nwalks through the mountains without fearing rhinoceros or tiger,\nenters battle without armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to gore him;\nthe tiger finds no place to claw him;\nweapons find no place to pierce him.\nWhy is this?\nBecause he has no place for death to enter.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to them;\nvirtue nurtures them;\nthings shape them;\ncircumstances complete them.\nThus the ten thousand things honor the Dao and value virtue.\nThe Dao is honored,\nvirtue is valued—\nnot by command, but by nature.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to them,\nnurtures them, rears them,\nmatures them, ripens them,\nsustains them, and protects them.\nIt gives birth without possessing,\nacts without claiming,\nleads without dominating—\nthis is called profound virtue.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich we take as the world’s mother.\nOnce we know the mother,\nwe may know her children.\nOnce we know the children,\nwe return to guard the mother—\nand to the end of life, no harm.\nBlock the openings,\nshut the doors—\nand to the end of life, no toil.\nOpen the openings,\nmeddle in affairs—\nand to the end of life, no rescue.\n\nSeeing the small is called clarity;\nguarding the soft is called strength.\nUse its light,\nreturn to clarity—\nleave no disaster for the self.\nThis is called following the constant.\n\nIf I had the slightest knowledge,\nwalking the great Dao,\nI would fear only straying from it.\nThe great Dao is smooth,\nyet people prefer shortcuts.\nThe court is immaculate,\nthe fields are overgrown,\nthe granaries are empty.\nThey wear fine robes,\ncarry sharp swords,\nsurfeit themselves with food and drink,\npossess wealth in excess—\nthese are the ways of banditry.\nThis is not the Dao.\n\nWhat is well planted cannot be uprooted;\nwhat is well embraced cannot slip away.\nThus descendants will continue ancestral sacrifices without end.\nCultivate it in yourself—\nyour virtue will be genuine.\nCultivate it in your family—\nyour virtue will overflow.\nCultivate it in your village—\nyour virtue will endure.\nCultivate it in your state—\nyour virtue will flourish.\nCultivate it in the world—\nyour virtue will be universal.\n\nThus observe the self through the self;\nobserve the family through the family;\nobserve the state through the state;\nobserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is so?\nBy this.\n\nOne whose virtue is profound\nis like an infant:\nwasps, scorpions, vipers, and snakes do not sting him;\nbirds of prey and wild beasts do not seize him.\nHis bones are weak, his sinews soft,\nyet his grip is firm.\nHe does not yet know the union of male and female,\nyet his organ stirs—\nso full is his essence.\nHe cries all day without growing hoarse—\nso perfect is his harmony.\n\nKnowing harmony is called constancy;\nknowing constancy is called clarity.\nExcessive vitality is called ill-omen;\nthe heart forcing qi is called violence.\nThings in their prime soon age—\nthis is called not following the Dao.\nNot following the Dao leads to early demise.\n\nThose who know do not speak;\nthose who speak do not know.\nBlock the openings,\nshut the doors,\nblunt the sharpness,\nuntie the tangles,\nsoften the glare,\nmerge with the dust—\nthis is called mysterious sameness.\n\nThus one cannot be too close,\nnor too distant;\ncannot be benefited,\nnor harmed;\ncannot be valued,\nnor despised.\nTherefore, it is honored under heaven.\n\nGovern the state with uprightness;\nwage war with surprise;\ntake the world with noncontrivance.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nThe more taboos in the world,\nthe poorer the people.\nThe more sharp tools the people have,\nthe more benighted the state.\nThe more cunning people are,\nthe more strange things arise.\nThe more laws are promulgated,\nthe more thieves and bandits appear.\n\nTherefore the sage says:\nI practice nonaction, and the people transform themselves;\nI love tranquility, and the people right themselves;\nI do not meddle, and the people prosper themselves;\nI desire not to desire, and the people return to simplicity.\n\nWhen the ruler is upright,\nthe people are simple;\nwhen the ruler is perceptive,\nthe state is secure.\nGood fortune and misfortune\nlie in the same place—\nwho knows their limit?\nThere is no constancy.\nUprightness reverts to perversity,\ngoodness reverts to evil.\nPeople’s delusion\nhas lasted long indeed.\n\nThus the sage is square but not cutting,\nsharp but not piercing,\nstraight but not overbearing,\nbright but not dazzling.\n\nThe upright reverts to the strange,\ngoodness reverts to the uncanny—\npeople’s delusion\nhas endured long indeed.\n\nThus the sage is square but does not cut,\nembraces all but does not pierce,\nis straight but not overbearing,\nis bright but not dazzling.\n\nIn governing people and serving Heaven,\nnothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly through frugality\ncan one be early in compliance—\nthis is called accumulating power in abundance.\nAccumulating power in abundance,\nthere is nothing one cannot overcome.\nWith nothing one cannot overcome,\nnone can know its limit.\nPossessing this, one holds the mother of the state\nand may long endure.\nThis is called the Dao of deep roots and firm foundation,\nthe Way of long life and enduring vision.\n\nGoverning a great state\nis like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the Dao is established in the world,\nits ghosts do not haunt.\nNot that its ghosts lack numinosity,\nbut their numinosity does not harm people.\nNot that their numinosity does not harm people,\nbut the sage also does not harm them.\nAs neither harms the other,\ntheir virtues converge and return.\n\nA great state is the lower reaches,\nthe female of the world,\nthe confluence of the world.\nThe female always overcomes the male through tranquility,\nand thus is fit to be below.\nWhen a great state humbles itself before a small state,\nit wins the small state.\nWhen a small state humbles itself before a great state,\nit is embraced by the great state.\nThus, some humble themselves to win,\nwhile others humble themselves and are won.\nA great state desires nothing more\nthan to nurture and shelter people;\na small state desires nothing more\nthan to enter and serve others.\nWhen both attain their desires,\nthe greater should humble itself.\n\nThe Dao is the lodging of the myriad things.\nIt is the treasure of the good,\nthe refuge of the not-good.\nFine words can win esteem,\nnoble conduct can exalt one above others.\nYet why reject those who are not good?\nThus, when the Son of Heaven is established\nand the Three Ministers are appointed,\nthough one may offer jade discs\nfollowed by teams of four horses,\nit is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.\n\nWhy was this valued of old?\nWas it not said:\nThrough it, one obtains without seeking,\nand the guilty are absolved?\nTherefore it is treasured by the world.\n\nIn acting without action,\nin attending without attending,\nin tasting without tasting,\nwhether great or small, many or few,\nrepay enmity with virtue.\nPlan for difficulty while it is easy,\nact on the great while it is minute.\n\nThe minute is where the world’s difficulties arise;\nthe great is where the world’s vastness begins.\nThus the sage never acts as though great,\nand so accomplishes his greatness.\n\nFor one who takes things lightly will surely lack trust,\nand one who treats much as easy will surely meet much difficulty.\nTherefore the sage regards things as difficult,\nand so never encounters difficulty.\n\nThat which is at peace is easy to hold;\nthat which shows no sign is easy to plan for;\nthat which is fragile is easy to break;\nthat which is subtle is easy to scatter.\nAct on it before it comes to be;\norder it before it falls into chaos.\n\nA tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a hair-fine sprout;\na nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth;\na journey of a thousand leagues begins beneath one’s feet.\nOne who acts on it will fail it;\none who grasps it will lose it.\nThus the sage acts not, and so does not fail;\ngrasps not, and so does not lose.\n\nIn their undertakings, the people\nconstantly fail when nearly complete.\nTherefore it is said:\nBe as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nand you will not fail in your affairs.\n\nThus the sage desires what others do not desire,\nand does not prize goods hard to obtain;\nlearns what others do not learn,\nrestoring what the multitude have passed over,\nand so can assist the self-so of the myriad things\nwithout daring to act.\n\nOf old, those who practiced the Way\ndid not do so to enlighten the people,\nbut to make them simple.\nThe people are hard to govern.\n\nWith their knowing,\nthey thus make knowledge the state’s thief.\nWith their not-knowing,\nthey thus make the state’s virtue.\nEver knowing these two,\none may also take them as a model.\nEver knowing the model—\nthis is called profound virtue,\ndeep and far-reaching,\nreturning with things to the Great Compliance.\n\nThus the rivers and seas\ncan be kings of the hundred valleys\nbecause they excel at lying low.\nTherefore they can be kings of the hundred valleys.\n\nThus the sage,\nwishing to be above the people,\nmust speak as though below them;\nwishing to lead the people,\nmust place himself behind them.\nTherefore he dwells above,\nyet the people do not find him burdensome;\nhe dwells ahead,\nyet the people do not find him harmful.\nThe world all delights in him,\nyet does not tire of him.\nBecause he does not contend,\nthe world cannot contend with him.\n\nLet a small state have few people,\nequipping them with tools for ten or a hundred,\nyet not putting them to use.\nLet the people value death\nand not wander far.\nThough there be boats and carriages,\nnone ride them;\nthough there be armor and weapons,\nnone display them.\nLet the people return to knotting cords for use.\nLet them find sweetness in their food,\nbeauty in their clothing,\njoy in their customs,\npeace in their dwellings.\nNeighboring states may be within sight,\nthe sounds of their cocks and dogs may be heard,\nyet the people will grow old and die\nwithout ever visiting one another.\n\nTrue words are not fine;\nfine words are not true.\nThe knowing are not learned;\nthe learned are not knowing.\nThe good are not many;\nthe many are not good.\n\nThe sage accumulates nothing.\nHaving fully given to others,\nhe has all the more.\nHaving fully bestowed upon others,\nhe has all the more.\n\nThus the Dao of Heaven\nbenefits and does not harm.\nThe Dao of Man\nacts and does not contend.\n\nThe world all calls me great,\nyet I seem unrefined.\nIt is because I am unrefined\nthat I can be great.\nWere I refined, I would long since have been small.\n\nNow, I ever possess three treasures,\nand hold fast to them:\nthe first is called compassion;\nthe second is called frugality;\nthe third is called not daring to be first in the world.\n\nWith compassion, one can be brave;\nwith frugality, one can be expansive;\nnot daring to be first in the world,\none can become the vessel of completion and leadership.\n\nNow, to abandon compassion and yet be brave,\nto abandon frugality and yet be expansive,\nto abandon the rear and yet be first—\nthis is death.\n\nFor with compassion,\none can attack and conquer,\ndefend and hold firm.\nHeaven will establish one\nas though surrounded by a wall of compassion.\n\nThus one who excels as a warrior is not martial;\none who excels in battle is not enraged;\none who excels in conquering the enemy does not engage;\none who excels in employing others acts as their subordinate.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention;\nthis is called employing others;\nthis is called matching Heaven—\nthe ultimate of antiquity.\n\nOn the use of arms, it is further said:\nI dare not be the host, but act as the guest;\nI dare not advance an inch, but retreat a foot.\nThis is called marching without marching,\nrolling up sleeves without baring arms,\nwielding weapons without weapons,\nconfronting enemies without enemies.\nNo misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy—\nto do so nearly destroys my treasures.\nThus when evenly matched armies meet,\nthe grieving side prevails.\n\nMy words are easy to know,\neasy to practice.\n\nYet the world knows not these words,\nnor can it practice them.\nFor speech has its lineage, affairs their lord—\nonly the unknowing fail to grasp this.\nThus those who do not know me are few,\nand I am thereby esteemed.\nHence the sage wears coarse cloth while concealing jade.\n\nTo know yet seem not to know is excellence;\nnot to know yet claim to know is affliction.\nOnly by recognizing this affliction as affliction\ncan one avoid affliction.\nThe people’s failure to fear\nportends the advent of great fear.\nDo not constrict their dwelling,\nnor stifle their livelihood.\nOnly by not stifling do they remain unstifled.\nThus the sage knows himself yet does not display himself,\nloves himself yet does not exalt himself.\n\nTherefore: discard the exhausted, adopt the new.\nTo be bold in daring is to court death;\nto be bold in restraint is to preserve life.\nOf these two, one brings benefit, the other harm—\nwho can fathom Heaven’s aversion?\nThus the Dao of Heaven:\ncontends not, yet excels in victory;\nspeaks not, yet responds with perfection;\nsummons not, yet comes of itself;\nacts leisurely, yet plans with excellence.\nThe net of Heaven is vast, its mesh wide—\nthough sparse, nothing slips through.\n\nIf the people constantly disregard death,\nhow can they be threatened with execution?\nIf the people constantly feared death,\nand I seized and executed those who transgressed,\nwho would dare to act thus?\nIf the people constantly feared death,\nthere would always be an executioner.\nTo kill in place of the executioner\nis to hew in place of the master carpenter—\nthose who hew in place of the master carpenter\nrarely escape injury to their hands.\n\nThe people’s hunger\narises from their rulers’ excessive taxation—\nhence their hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed\narises from their rulers’ meddling—\nhence their unruliness.\nThe people’s disregard for death\narises from their rulers’ pursuit of lavish living—\nhence their disregard for death.\nOnly those who do not strive to preserve life\nare wiser than those who overvalue life.\n\nMan in life is supple and weak,\nin death stiff and strong.\nAll things—plants and trees—\nin life are supple and tender,\nin death withered and dry.\nThus it is said:\nthe stiff and strong are companions of death,\nthe supple and weak companions of life.\nTherefore:\nwhen weapons are strong, they do not prevail;\nwhen trees are strong, they break.\nThe strong and great dwell below,\nthe supple and weak dwell above.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow:\nthe high is pressed down, the low raised up;\nthe excessive is reduced, the deficient replenished.\nThe Dao of Heaven reduces the excessive\nto augment the deficient.\nThe way of man is otherwise:\nit reduces the deficient\nto offer to the excessive.\nWho can take from the excessive\nto offer to Heaven?\nOnly one who possesses the Dao.\n\nThus the sage acts yet does not possess,\naccomplishes yet does not dwell in it.\nIn this way he does not wish to display his worth.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the hard and strong—\nfor nothing can replace it.\nThat the weak overcomes the strong,\nthe soft overcomes the hard,\nthe world knows yet cannot practice.\n\nThus the sage’s words declare:\nTo receive the state’s disgrace is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain;\nto bear the realm’s misfortune is called the king of all under Heaven.\nStraight words seem their reverse.\n\nGreat enmity must leave some resentment—\nhow can this be deemed good?\nTherefore the sage holds the left tally\nyet does not demand from others.\nThose with virtue oversee the tally;\nthose without virtue oversee the levy.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven shows no partiality,\nyet it is ever with the good.\n\nThe virtue of the Three and the One:\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;\nthe name that can be named is not the constant name.\nThe nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things;\nthe named is the mother of the ten thousand things.\nThus, constantly without desire,\none observes its subtleties;\nconstantly with desire,\none observes its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet differ in name.\nTogether they are called the profound,\nthe profound within the profound,\nthe gate of all subtleties.\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nthus ugliness arises;\nall know good as good—\nthus not-good arises.\nBeing and non-being give birth to one another;\ndifficult and easy complete one another;\nlong and short shape one another;\nhigh and low fill one another;\nnotes and voices harmonize with one another;\nbefore and after follow one another—\nthis is constant.\n\nTherefore the sage abides in non-action,\npractices the teaching without words,\nlets the ten thousand things arise without initiating,\nacts without depending,\naccomplishes without dwelling.\nOnly because he does not dwell\ndoes it not leave him.\n\nDo not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend;\ndo not value rare goods, and the people will not steal;\ndo not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be disturbed.\nThus the sage’s governance:\nempties their minds,\nfills their bellies,\nweakens their ambitions,\nstrengthens their bones.\nEver causes the people to be without knowledge and without desire.\nCauses the wise not to dare act—\nand where none act,\nthere is nothing left ungoverned.\n\nThe Dao is empty yet in use never fills.\nAbysmal, it seems the ancestor of the ten thousand things.\nBlunts its sharpness,\nuntangles its knots,\nsoftens its glare,\nmerges with its dust.\nDeep, it seems perhaps to exist.\nI know not whose child it is—\nit seems the image before the Lord.\n\nHeaven and earth are not humane:\nthey treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not humane:\nhe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\n\nThe space between heaven and earth—\nis it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nthe more it moves, the more it produces.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to guard the center.\n\nNourishing the spirit without death:\nthis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gate of the mysterious female\nis called the root of heaven and earth.\nGently it seems to endure,\nin use never exhausted.\n\nHeaven is eternal, earth enduring.\nHeaven and earth can be eternal and enduring\nbecause they do not live for themselves—\nthus they can long endure.\nTherefore the sage withdraws his person yet his person comes first,\nputs his person outside yet his person remains.\nIs it not because he is without self-interest\nthat he can fulfill his self-interest?\n\nThe highest good is like water:\nwater benefits the ten thousand things yet contends not,\ndwells in places all disdain—\nthus it is near the Dao.\n\nIn dwelling, be close to the earth;\nin heart, be deep as an abyss;\nin giving, be like heaven;\nin speech, be truthful;\nin governance, be orderly;\nin affairs, be capable;\nin action, be timely.\nOnly by not contending\nis one free from blame.\n\nFill it to\n\nThus, having is for benefit,\nnot-having is for use.\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe chase of hunting and racing madden the heart,\nrare goods distort conduct,\nthe five flavors dull the palate,\nthe five tones deafen the ears.\n\nTherefore, the sage’s governance\nis for the belly, not the eyes—\nthus he rejects that and takes this.\nHonor and disgrace are like terror:\nvalue great trouble as you do the body.\nWhat does it mean, \"honor and disgrace are like terror\"?\nHonor is inferior—\ngained like terror, lost like terror.\nThis is what is meant by \"honor and disgrace are like terror.\"\nWhat does it mean, \"value great trouble as you do the body\"?\nThe reason I have great trouble\nis that I have a body.\nWhen I no longer have a body,\nwhat trouble could I have?\nThus, one who values the body as the world\nmay be entrusted with the world;\none who loves the body as the world\nmay be relied upon with the world.\n\nLook at it yet do not see—\ncall it \"subtle.\"\nListen to it yet do not hear—\ncall it \"rare.\"\nGrasp it yet do not obtain—\ncall it \"elusive.\"\nThese three cannot be fully reckoned,\nthus they merge into one.\nIts rising is not bright,\nits falling is not dark.\nUnceasing, unnameable,\nit returns to nothingness—\nthis is called the form of the formless,\nthe image of nothingness,\nthis is called the indistinct and vague.\nEncounter it yet do not see its front,\nfollow it yet do not see its back.\nHold to the ancient Dao\nto master present being,\nto know the ancient beginning—\nthis is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe ancients who were good at the Dao\nwere subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating,\ntoo deep to be known.\nIt is only because they cannot be known\nthat I am forced to describe them:\nHesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;\ncautious, as if fearing all around;\nsolemn, as if a guest;\ndissolving, as if ice melting;\nsimple, as if uncarved wood;\nhollow, as if a valley;\nopaque, as if muddy.\nWho can still the muddy and gradually clarify it?\nWho can rouse the still and gradually bring it to life?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness—\nthus they can wear out without being made new.\n\nTo the utmost emptiness, hold fast to stillness.\nThe ten thousand things arise together,\nand I observe their return.\nThings flourish abundantly,\neach returning to its root—\nthis is called stillness.\nStillness is called returning to destiny,\nreturning to destiny is called constancy.\nKnowing constancy is called clarity.\nNot knowing constancy leads to recklessness and disaster.\nKnowing constancy is acceptance,\nacceptance is impartiality,\nimpartiality is kingship,\nkingship is heaven,\nheaven is the Dao,\nthe Dao is enduring—\nthough the body perishes, it is not imperiled.\n\nThe highest rulers are known, yet below them,\nsome are praised, some feared, some despised.\nWhere trust is insufficient, there is lack of trust.\nHow careful they are with their words!\nWhen tasks are accomplished and affairs settled,\nthe people say, \"We did it naturally.\"\nWhen the great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise;\nwhen wisdom and cunning emerge, great hypocrisy follows;\nwhen the six relations are disharmonious, filial piety and kindness appear;\nwhen the state is in chaos, loyal ministers emerge.\n\nCut off sageness, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold;\ncut off benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety;\ncut off skill, discard profit, and thieves and robbers disappear.\nThese three sayings, as mere patterns, are insufficient—\nthus let them have something to belong to:\nsee the plain, embrace the uncarved,\nlessen self-interest, diminish desire.\nCut off learning, and there is no worry.\nHow much difference is there between \"yes\" and \"ah\"?\nHow much difference between good and bad?\nWhat people fear cannot but be feared—\nhow boundless this seems, not yet at its end!\nThe crowd is joyous,\nas if partaking in the great sacrifice,\nas if ascending the springtime terrace.\nI alone am unmoved,\nlike an infant who has not yet smiled,\nforlorn, as if with nowhere to return.\nThe crowd all has more than enough,\nI alone seem lacking.\nI have the heart of a fool—\nhow muddled!\nThe\n\nThe Way cannot be acted upon—\nthose who act upon it ruin it,\nthose who grasp it lose it.\nThings may advance or follow,\nbe hot or cold,\ndescend or ascend.\nThus the sage discards excess,\ndiscards extravagance,\ndiscards extremity.\nWith the Dao he assists the lord of men,\nnot using arms to overpower the world.\nHis affairs return to him—\nwhere the army has dwelt,\nthorns and brambles grow.\nGood outcomes are merely sufficient;\ndo not use them to seize strength.\nBe sufficient yet do not boast,\nbe sufficient yet do not vaunt,\nbe sufficient yet do not claim attainment.\nThis is called being sufficient yet strong.\nThings flourish then age—\nthis is called not-Dao.\nNot-Dao comes early to its end.\n\nArms are instruments of ill omen—\nthings may shun them,\nthus the man of desire does not dwell in them.\nThe gentleman dwells in the left,\nbut in using arms, honors the right.\nThus arms are not the gentleman’s instruments.\nArms are instruments of ill omen—\nonly when unavoidable are they used,\nand tranquility is prized.\nDo not glorify them;\nto glorify them is to delight in killing.\nThose who delight in killing\ncannot achieve their will in the world.\n\nThus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;\nin mourning rites, the right is honored.\nTherefore the deputy general stands on the left,\nwhile the supreme general stands on the right—\nthis means they are positioned as in mourning rites.\nWhen many are killed,\none should grieve and mourn them.\nVictory in battle\nis treated with mourning rites.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless and uncarved—\nonly small, yet none in the world dare make it a subject.\nIf lords and kings could hold to it,\nthe myriad things would of themselves submit.\nHeaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew,\nand the people, without command, of themselves find balance.\n\nWhen the system begins, names arise—\nonce names exist, one should also know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop is how to avoid peril.\nThe Dao’s presence in the world\nis like streams and valleys flowing to rivers and seas.\nKnowing others is wisdom.\n\nThe one who knows oneself is enlightened.\nThe one who conquers others possesses strength.\nThe one who conquers oneself is mighty.\nThe one who knows contentment is rich.\nThe one who acts with perseverance has resolve.\nThe one who does not lose their place endures.\nThe one who dies yet is not forgotten lives long.\n\nThe Dao flows—ah, it may be grasped to left or right.\nIt accomplishes and completes affairs yet claims no possession.\nThe myriad things return to it,\nyet it does not act as their master—\nthus it is ever without desire.\nIt may be named as small,\nyet the myriad things return to it,\nand it does not act as their master—\nit may be called great.\nTherefore the sage’s ability to achieve greatness\nlies in not asserting greatness,\nand so achieves greatness.\n\nHold to the great image, and the world will come—\ncoming without harm, secure, peaceful, and greatly at ease.\nMusic and fine food may pass the traveler by,\nyet the Dao’s words, when uttered, are:\nbland—ah, their flavor is plain.\nLooked at, they are not enough to be seen.\nListened to, they are not enough to be heard.\nUsed, they cannot be exhausted.\n\nWhen you wish to contract something, you must first expand it.\nWhen you wish to weaken something, you must first strengthen it.\nWhen you wish to discard something, you must first elevate it.\nWhen you wish to seize something, you must first give it.\nThis is called subtle illumination:\nthe soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nFish must not be removed from the depths.\nA state’s sharpest instruments must not be displayed.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\nIf lords and kings could hold to it,\nthe myriad things would transform of themselves.\nShould desire arise,\nI shall press it down\nwith the uncarved block of nameless simplicity.\nThe uncarved block of nameless simplicity\nwill not contend,\nand so the world will of itself be upright.\n\n*Silk Manuscript Laozi, Collated—2,426 characters*\n\nHigher virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue.\nLower virtue does not lose virtue, and thus lacks virtue.\nHigher virtue acts not and has no purpose in acting.\nHigher benevolence acts but has no purpose in acting.\nHigher righteousness acts and has purpose in acting.\nHigher ritual acts, yet none respond—\nthen one rolls up sleeves and forces compliance.\nThus the Way is lost.\n\nWhen the Way is lost, then comes virtue;\nwhen virtue is lost, then comes benevolence;\nwhen benevolence is lost, then comes righteousness;\nwhen righteousness is lost, then comes ritual.\nRitual is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nthe beginning of chaos.\nForeknowledge is the flower of the Way,\nthe beginning of folly.\nTherefore the great man dwells in the thick, not in the thin;\nin the solid, not in the flowery.\nThus he discards the latter and takes the former.\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil;\nspirits attained the One and became numinous;\nvalleys attained the One and became full;\nlords and kings attained the One and became upright.\nThis is how they attained it.\nIf Heaven were not clear, it would fear to rend;\nif Earth were not tranquil, it would fear to quake;\nif spirits were not numinous, they would fear to vanish;\nif valleys were not full, they would fear to dry;\nif lords and kings were not noble and exalted, they would fear to fall.\nThus the noble must take the lowly as its root,\nthe high must take the low as its foundation.\nTherefore lords and kings call themselves \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"destitute\"—\nthis is taking the lowly as their root, is it not?\nThus attaining the utmost in praise is to receive no praise.\nTherefore do not desire to be jingling like jade,\nnor clattering like stone.\n\nThe highest scholar, hearing the Way, diligently practices it.\nThe middling scholar, hearing the Way, sometimes keeps it, sometimes loses it.\nThe lowest scholar, hearing the Way, laughs loudly at it.\nIf it were not laughed at, it would not be the Way.\nThus the established sayings have it:\nThe bright Way seems dim;\nthe advancing Way seems to retreat;\nthe level Way seems uneven.\nHigher virtue seems like a valley;\ngreat whiteness seems sullied;\nabundant virtue seems insufficient.\nEstablished virtue seems unsteady;\ntrue substance seems fickle;\nthe great square has no corners;\nthe great vessel is slow to form;\nthe great tone has scarce sound.\nThe heavenly image has no form;\nthe Way, though vast, has no name.\nOnly the Way is good at beginning and good at completing.\n\nReversion is the movement of the Way;\nweakness is the function of the Way.\nThe myriad things of the world are born of being;\nbeing is born of non-being.\n\nThe Way generates the One,\nthe One generates the Two,\nthe Two generate the Three,\nthe Three generate the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nblending their qi to attain harmony.\n\nWhat the world despises—\n\"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" \"destitute\"—\nare the very names kings and dukes use for themselves.\nThus things may be diminished yet increased,\nor increased yet diminished.\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n\"The violent do not die a natural death.\"\nI shall take this as the father of my teaching.\n\nThe softest under heaven\ngallops through the hardest under heaven.\nNon-being enters where there is no gap.\nThus I know the benefit of non-action.\nTeaching without words,\nthe benefit of non-action—\nfew under heaven can attain this.\n\nWhich is dearer, fame or life?\nWhich is greater, life or wealth?\nWhich is more harmful, gain or loss?\nExcessive love must lead to great expenditure;\nhoarding much must lead to heavy loss.\nThus, knowing contentment brings no disgrace;\nknowing when to stop brings no danger—\nthis is how to endure long.\n\nGreat perfection seems flawed,\nyet its use is never exhausted.\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nyet its use is never depleted.\nGreat straightness seems bent;\ngreat skill seems clumsy;\ngreat eloquence seems halting.\n\nRestlessness overcomes cold;\nstillness overcomes heat.\nPurity and stillness can set the world right.\n\nWhen the world has the Way,\nwarhorses are retired to fertilize fields.\nWhen the world lacks the Way,\ncavalry mounts are born in the wilds.\nNo sin is greater than desire;\nno calamity is greater than discontent;\nno fault is more grievous than covetousness.\nThus, knowing contentment’s contentment\nis always contentment.\n\nWithout stepping outside, know the world;\nwithout looking out the window, know the heavenly Way.\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\nThus the sage knows without traveling,\nnames without seeing,\naccomplishes without acting.\n\nThose who pursue learning increase day by day;\nthose who hear the Way decrease day by day.\nDecrease and further decrease,\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nTo take the world, one must always be without affairs.\nIf one engages in affairs,\none is not fit to take the world.\n\nThe sage has no fixed mind,\nbut takes the people’s mind as his mind.\nThe good, he treats as good;\nthe not-good, he also treats as good—\nthus attaining goodness.\nThe trustworthy, he trusts;\nthe untrustworthy, he also trusts—\nthus attaining trustworthiness.\nThe sage, in the world,\ncontracts his mind for the world,\nblending his mind with the world.\nThe people all strain their ears and eyes,\nand the sage treats them all as children.\n\nEmerging into life, entering death.\nThose who follow life are thirteen;\nthose who follow death are thirteen;\nyet people, in living their lives,\nall move toward the land of death—thirteen.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they cling to life too tightly.\nI have heard that one who is good at preserving life\nwalks the hills without avoiding rhinos or tigers,\nenters battle without donning armor or weapons.\nThe rhino has nowhere to thrust its horn;\nthe tiger has nowhere to sink its claws;\nweapons have nowhere to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this?\nBecause there is no place of death in him.\n\nThe Way gives them life, and virtue rears them;\nthings shape them, and instruments complete them.\nThus the myriad things honor the Way and value virtue.\nThe honor of the Way, the value of virtue—\nnothing bestows this, yet it is always natural.\nThe Way gives them life, rears them,\nnurtures them, matures them,\nripens them, sustains them,\nprotects them, and returns them.\nGiving life without possessing,\nacting without claiming,\nleading without dominating—\nthis is called profound virtue.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich may be taken as the mother of the world.\nHaving attained the mother,\none may know her children.\nHaving known the children,\nreturn to guard the mother—\nand to the end of life, one will not be imperiled.\nBlock the openings,\nshut the doors—\nand to the end of life, one will not be weary.\nOpen the openings,\nmultiply affairs—\nand to the end of life, one will not be saved.\nSeeing the small is called illumination;\nguarding the soft is called strength.\n\nUse its light,\nreturn to its clarity—\nnot letting the body come to harm,\nthis is called inheriting the constant.\n\nWere I to have the slightest knowledge,\nI would walk the great Way,\nfearing only to stray.\nThe great Way is level,\nyet the people delight in byways.\n\nThe court is immaculate,\nthe fields overgrown,\nthe granaries empty.\nThey wear fine brocades,\nbear sharp swords,\nsurfeit on food and drink,\nhoard wealth in excess—\nthese are called thieves and braggarts.\nThieves and braggarts are not of the Way.\n\nWhat is well planted cannot be uprooted,\nwhat is well embraced cannot slip away.\nThrough this, descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;\ncultivate it in the household, and its virtue abounds;\ncultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;\ncultivate it in the state, and its virtue flourishes;\ncultivate it in the world, and its virtue is vast.\n\nObserve the self through the self,\nobserve the household through the household,\nobserve the village through the village,\nobserve the state through the state,\nobserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nOne whose virtue is deeply rooted\nis like an infant:\nwasps and scorpions do not sting,\nwild beasts do not seize,\nbirds of prey do not strike.\nThough bones are weak and sinews soft, the grasp is firm.\nNot yet knowing the union of male and female, the organ stirs—\nsuch is the perfection of essence.\nCrying all day without hoarseness—\nsuch is the perfection of harmony.\nTo know harmony is called the constant;\nto know the constant is called illumination.\nTo augment life is called ill-omened;\nfor the mind to command qi is called force.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—\nthis is called not the Way.\nWhat is not the Way ends early.\n\nThe wise do not speak,\nthose who speak are not wise.\nBlock the openings,\nshut the doors,\nblunt the sharpness,\nuntangle the knots,\nsoften the glare,\nmerge with the dust—\nthis is called profound unity.\n\nThus, it cannot be made close,\nnor can it be made distant.\nIt cannot be benefited,\nnor can it be harmed.\nIt cannot be exalted,\nnor can it be debased.\nTherefore, it is honored by the world.\n\nGovern the state with uprightness,\nuse the army with surprise,\ntake the world with non-action.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\n\nThe more taboos in the world,\nthe poorer the people.\nThe more sharp tools the people have,\nthe more benighted the state.\nThe more knowledge people possess,\nthe more strange things arise.\nThe more laws and ordinances are displayed,\nthe more thieves and bandits appear.\nTherefore, the sage says:\nI practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, and the people right themselves;\nI do nothing, and the people enrich themselves;\nI desire not to desire, and the people become simple as uncarved wood.\n\nWhen the ruler is dim and dull,\nthe people are honest and simple.\nWhen the ruler is keen and sharp,\nthe state is divided and perilous.\nDisaster is where fortune leans;\nfortune is where disaster lurks.\nWho knows their limit?\nThere is no constant standard.\nThe upright turns to the strange,\nthe good turns to the ominous.\nThe people’s delusion has lasted long indeed.\n\nThus, the square is not cut,\nthe inclusive is not piercing,\nthe straight is not restrictive,\nthe bright is not dazzling.\n\nIn governing people and serving Heaven,\nnothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly through frugality can one be early prepared.\nBeing early prepared is called accumulating virtue.\nAccumulating virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome.\nHaving nothing one cannot overcome,\nnone can know its limit.\n\nWhose limit none can know—this is how one may possess the state.\nPossessing the state’s mother, one may endure long.\nThis is called deep roots and firm foundation,\nthe Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the world is established by the Dao,\nits ghosts do not become spirits.\nNot that its ghosts do not become spirits,\nbut their spirits do not harm people.\nNot that their spirits do not harm people,\nbut the sage also does not harm.\nWhen the two do not harm each other,\nvirtue and power thus converge.\n\nA great state is the lower reaches,\nthe female of the world,\nthe meeting place of the world.\nThe female always overcomes the male through stillness.\nBeing still, she thus fittingly remains below.\nWhen a great state lowers itself to small states, it wins over small states.\nWhen a small state lowers itself to a great state, it wins over the great state.\nThus, some lower themselves to win,\nsome lower themselves and win.\nA great state desires nothing more than to unite and nurture people;\na small state desires nothing more than to enter and serve people.\nWhen both attain their desires,\nthe greater must fittingly remain below.\n\nThe Dao is the wellspring of the ten thousand things.\nIt is the treasure of the good,\nand the refuge of the not-good.\nFine words can be traded in the marketplace;\nnoble conduct can bring honor to others.\nIf people are not good,\nwhy should they be cast aside?\nThus, when establishing the Son of Heaven\nand appointing the Three Ministers,\nthough one may have jade discs preceded by teams of four horses,\nit is better to sit and present this.\n\nWhy was this Dao esteemed by the ancients?\nIs it not because one seeks and obtains,\nand sins are thereby absolved?\nThus, it is honored throughout the world.\n\nPractice non-action, engage in no business,\nsavor the flavorless.\nGreat or small, many or few—repay enmity with virtue.\nResolve difficulty in its ease,\nachieve greatness in its smallness.\nThe world’s difficulties arise from ease;\nthe world’s greatness arises from smallness.\nTherefore, the sage never strives for greatness,\nand thus accomplishes greatness.\n\nIf one is hasty, trust will be scarce;\nif one takes things lightly, difficulties will multiply.\nTherefore, the sage treats difficulty with care,\nand thus never encounters difficulty.\n\nIn its tranquility, it is easy to hold.\nIn its unformed state, it is easy to plan.\nIn its fragility, it is easy to break.\nIn its subtlety, it is easy to scatter.\nAct before it exists;\ngovern before it becomes chaotic.\n\nA tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout.\nA nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth.\nA journey of a hundred *ren* begins beneath one’s feet.\nThose who act will fail;\nthose who grasp will lose.\nThus, the sage practices non-action and does not fail,\nholds nothing and does not lose.\n\nIn their undertakings, people often fail when near completion.\nTherefore, be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nand there will be no failure.\n\nThus, the sage desires what others do not desire\nand does not prize rare goods.\nHe learns what others do not learn,\nreturning to what the multitude has passed by.\nHe can assist the natural course of the ten thousand things\nbut dares not act.\n\nTherefore, it is said:\nThose who follow the Dao do not enlighten the people,\nbut rather keep them simple.\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause of their knowledge.\nThus, governing a state with knowledge\nis the state’s ruin.\nGoverning a state without knowledge\nis the state’s blessing.\nTo constantly know these two principles\nis also a model.\nTo constantly know this model\nis called profound virtue.\nProfound virtue is deep and far-reaching,\nturning back with things to reach great compliance.\n\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys\nis because they excel at staying low.\nThus, they can be kings of all valleys.\nTherefore, when the sage wishes to be above the people,\nhe must speak as though he is below them.\nWhen he wishes to lead the people,\nhe must place himself behind them.\nThus, though he dwells in front, the people do not feel harmed;\nthough he dwells above, the people do not feel burdened.\nThe world delights in following him and does not grow weary.\nIs it not because he does not contend?\nThus, none in the world can contend with him.\n\nA small state with few people,\nthough it has tools for a hundred or a thousand,\ndoes not use them.\nIt makes the people value life and not travel far.\nThough there are boats and carriages, none ride them;\nthough there are armor and weapons, none display them.\nIt makes the people return to knotting cords for use.\nThey find their food sweet,\ntheir clothing beautiful,\ntheir customs joyful,\ntheir dwellings secure.\nNeighboring states are within sight,\nthe sounds of chickens and dogs are within hearing,\nyet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.\n\nThough true words are not beautiful,\nbeautiful words are not true.\nThe wise are not learned;\nthe learned are not wise.\nThe good are not excessive;\nthe excessive are not good.\nThe sage accumulates nothing.\nHaving fully given to others, he has even more;\nhaving fully bestowed upon others, he has even greater abundance.\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm.\nThe Dao of humans acts but does not contend.\n\nThe world all say I am great, great yet not confined.\nIt is precisely because I am great that I am not confined.\nIf I were confined, I would have long since become small.\n\nI always have three treasures to preserve:\nthe first is compassion,\nthe second is frugality,\nthe third is not daring to be first in the world.\nWith compassion, one can be brave.\nWith frugality, one can be expansive.\nNot daring to be first in the world,\none can become the leader of all things.\n\nNow, if one abandons compassion yet seeks bravery,\nabandons humility yet seeks precedence,\none will surely perish.\nCompassion in battle brings victory;\nin defense, it brings firmness.\nHeaven will establish one—\nyou should surround them with compassion.\n\nThe good warrior is not martial;\nthe good fighter is not enraged;\nthe good conqueror does not engage the enemy;\nthe good employer of people remains below them.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthe power of employing people,\nthe ultimate of Heaven’s ancient ways.\n\nThere is a saying in the use of arms:\nI dare not be the host but act as the guest;\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\nThis is called marching without marching,\nraising arms without arms,\nwielding weapons without weapons,\nfacing no enemy.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy;\nunderestimating the enemy risks losing my treasures.\nThus, when evenly matched armies clash,\nthe grieving side will prevail.\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice,\nyet none in the world can know them,\nnone can practice them.\nWords have an origin;\naffairs have a master.\nIt is only through ignorance\nthat I am not known.\n\nThose who know are rare—thus I am valued.\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.\nTo know yet not claim knowledge is supreme;\nnot to know yet claim knowledge is a flaw.\nThe sage is free from flaws\nbecause he treats his flaw as a flaw—\nthus he is free from flaws.\n\nWhen the people no longer fear what should be feared,\ngreat fear will come.\nDo not restrict their dwelling,\ndo not stifle their livelihood.\nOnly by not stifling them will they not be stifled.\nThus the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nloves himself but does not exalt himself.\nTherefore he discards the one and takes the other.\n\nHe who is brave in daring will be killed;\nhe who is brave in not daring will live.\nOf these two, one brings benefit, the other harm.\nWhat Heaven detests—who knows the reason?\nThe Dao of Heaven\ndoes not contend yet excels in victory,\ndoes not speak yet excels in response,\ndoes not summon yet comes of itself,\nis unhurried yet excels in planning.\nHeaven’s net is vast,\nwide-meshed yet nothing slips through.\n\nIf the people constantly do not fear death,\nhow can they be frightened with death?\nIf the people constantly fear death,\nthen those who act perversely I will seize and kill—\nwho would dare?\nIf the people must always fear death,\nthere is always an executioner.\nTo kill the executioner is like hewing the master carpenter’s wood—\nfew will not wound their own hands.\n\nPeople suffer hunger\nbecause their rulers take too much in taxes—\nthus they suffer hunger.\nThe common people are ungovernable\nbecause their superiors impose too many measures—\nthus they are ungovernable.\nThe people disregard death\nbecause they seek life too fervently—\nthus they disregard death.\nOnly he who does not make life his purpose\nis wiser than one who values life.\n\nIn life, people are supple and weak;\nin death, they are stiff and strong.\nAll things—plants and trees—\nin life are supple and fragile;\nin death, they are withered and dry.\nThus it is said:\nThe stiff and strong are companions of death;\nthe supple, weak, and delicate are companions of life.\nTherefore a strong army will not prevail,\na strong tree will be felled.\nThe great and strong dwell below;\nthe supple, weak, and delicate dwell above.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow:\nthe high is pressed down, the low is lifted up.\nWhat has excess is reduced,\nwhat is deficient is supplemented.\nThus the Dao of Heaven reduces excess and supplements deficiency,\nbut the human way is not so—\nit reduces deficiency to serve excess.\nWho can take from excess to offer to Heaven?\nOnly one who possesses the Dao.\nThus the sage acts but does not possess,\naccomplishes but does not dwell.\nIn this way, he does not wish to display his worth.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the hard and strong—\nnothing can replace it.\nThat the weak overcomes the strong,\nthe soft overcomes the hard—\nnone in the world do not know this,\nyet none can practice it.\nThus the sage’s words say:\nTo bear the state’s disgrace is called master of the altars of soil and grain;\nto bear the state’s misfortune is called king of all under Heaven.\nTrue words seem paradoxical.\n\nTo reconcile great resentment,\nsome resentment will remain—\nhow can this be good?\nThus the sage holds the tally\nbut does not demand from others.\nTherefore the virtuous control the tally,\nthe unvirtuous control the tax.\nThe Dao of Heaven shows no partiality—\nit always sides with the good.\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nThe nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things;\nthe named is the mother of the ten thousand things.\nThus, in constant non-desire,\none observes its mystery;\nin constant desire,\none observes its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together but differ in name.\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and more profound—\nthe gate of all mysteries.\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nugliness arises.\nWhen all know good,\nthen non-good is established.\nThus being and non-being produce each other,\ndifficult and easy complete each other,\nlong and short shape each other,\nhigh and low fill each other,\nnote and voice harmonize with each other,\nbefore and after follow each other—\nthis is constant.\n\nTherefore the sage dwells in non-action,\npractices wordless teaching,\nlets the ten thousand things arise without beginning them,\nacts without claiming,\naccomplishes without dwelling.\nOnly by not dwelling\ndoes it not depart.\n\nDo not exalt the worthy,\nand the people will not contend.\nDo not value rare goods,\nand the people will not steal.\nDo not display what is desirable,\nand the people’s hearts will not be disturbed.\nThus the sage’s governance:\nempties their minds,\nfills their bellies,\nweakens their ambitions,\nstrengthens their bones.\nAlways keeps the people without knowledge, without desire,\nso that the knowledgeable dare not act—\nthen nothing will be ungoverned.\n\nApply the Dao in the center and use it without exhausting it.\nVast and deep—it is the ancestor of the ten thousand things.\nBlunt its sharpness,\nuntangle its knots,\nsoften its glare,\nmerge with its dust.\nProfound and still—it seems to endure.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit seems to have existed before the Lord.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not humane—\nthey treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not humane—\nhe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nit is like a bellows—\nempty yet inexhaustible,\nmoving and producing more.\nMuch talk leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to guard the center.\n\nThe spirit of the valley never dies—\nthis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gate of the mysterious female\nis called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle and continuous—\nit seems to exist.\nUse it without effort.\n\nHeaven is eternal, Earth enduring.\nHeaven and Earth can be eternal and enduring\nbecause they do not live for themselves—\nthus they can live long.\nTherefore the sage places himself behind yet finds himself ahead,\nputs himself outside yet remains preserved.\nIs it not because he is selfless?\nThus he can achieve his self.\n\nThe softest in the world\nrides over the hardest in the world.\nThe insubstantial enters where there is no space.\nThus I know the benefit of non-action.\nWordless teaching,\nthe benefit of non-action—\nfew in the world attain these.\n\nThe highest virtue is like water—\nwater benefits the myriad things yet remains still.\nIt dwells where the multitude shuns,\nthus it is near the Dao.\n\nDwell in a good place,\nthe heart in profound stillness,\ngive with good faith,\ngovern with good order,\nact with good skill,\nmove with good timing.\nOnly by not contending\ndoes one avoid blame.\n\nTo fill it when straight\nis not as good as stopping.\nTo sharpen it to a point\ncannot be preserved long.\nA room filled with gold and jade\ncannot be guarded.\nWealth and honor breed arrogance—\nthis brings one’s downfall.\nTo withdraw when the work is done\nis the Dao of Heaven.\n\nNurture the luminous spirit, embrace the One—\ncan one not stray from it?\nConcentrate the qi to utmost softness—\ncan one be like an infant?\nPurify the profound mirror—\ncan one be without flaw?\nLove the people and govern the state—\ncan one do so without cunning?\nThe gates of Heaven open and close—\ncan one remain the female?\nUnderstanding all four directions—\ncan one do so without action?\n\nGive life, nurture it—\ngive life yet do not possess,\nact yet do not dominate.\nThis is called the mysterious virtue.\n\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nwhere there is nothing, lies the use of the cart.\nClay is shaped into vessels—\nwhere there is nothing, lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room—\nwhere there is nothing, lies the use of the room.\nThus, being is for benefit,\nnon-being is for use.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe chase of hunting maddens the heart,\nrare goods corrupt conduct,\nthe five flavors dull the palate,\nthe five tones deafen the ears.\nThus the sage’s governance\nis for the belly, not the eyes.\nTherefore, discard the latter and take the former.\n\nFavor and disgrace are like terror—\nvalue great misfortune as one’s own body.\nWhy are favor and disgrace like terror?\nFavor is lowly—\ngaining it is like terror,\nlosing it is like terror.\nThis is why favor and disgrace are like terror.\nWhy value great misfortune as one’s own body?\nThe reason I have great misfortune\nis because I have a self.\nIf I had no self,\nwhat misfortune could there be?\nThus, one who values the self as the world\nmay be entrusted with the world.\nOne who loves the self as the world\nmay be given the world.\n\nLook at it yet do not see—\ncall it the subtle.\nListen to it yet do not hear—\ncall it the rare.\nTouch it yet do not grasp—\ncall it the elusive.\nThese three cannot be fully fathomed,\nso they merge into one.\nIts rising is not bright,\nits falling is not dark.\nUnceasing, unnameable—\nit returns to nothingness.\nThis is the form of the formless,\nthe image of the imageless.\nThis is the elusive and evanescent.\nFollow it and see no rear,\nmeet it and see no front.\nHold to the Dao of the present\nto master the present’s being,\nto know the ancient beginning.\nThis is the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in the Dao\nwere subtly profound and mysteriously penetrating,\nso deep they could not be described.\nThus, forced to describe them, I say:\nYielding, as if crossing a winter stream;\ncautious, as if fearing all around;\nsolemn, as if a guest;\ndissolving, as if ice melting;\nsimple, as if uncarved wood;\nturbid, as if muddy water;\nvast, as if a valley.\nMuddy water, when still, gradually clears.\nWho can remain still\nuntil the moment of action?\nThose who preserve this Dao\ndo not desire fullness.\nOnly by not desiring fullness\ncan one remain worn yet not exhausted.\n\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nhold fast to profound stillness.\nThe myriad things arise together—\nI observe their return.\nThings flourish in abundance,\neach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness.\nStillness is called returning to destiny.\nReturning to destiny is the constant.\nKnowing the constant is called illumination.\nNot knowing the constant—\nreckless action brings misfortune.\nKnowing the constant brings acceptance,\nacceptance brings impartiality,\nimpartiality brings kingship,\nkingship brings Heaven,\nHeaven brings the Dao,\nthe Dao brings enduringness.\n\nDo not endanger the self.\nIn the highest,\nthe people know only that it exists.\nNext,\nthey draw near and praise it.\nNext,\nthey fear it.\nNext,\nthey revile it.\nWhen trust is insufficient,\nthere is indeed distrust.\nCautious, how precious are words!\nWhen success is achieved and affairs completed,\nthe people say, “We are naturally so.”\nThus, when the great Dao is abandoned,\nthere is benevolence and righteousness.\nWhen cleverness emerges,\nthere is great hypocrisy.\nWhen the six relations are not in harmony,\nthere are filial piety and kindness.\nWhen the state is in chaos,\nthere are loyal ministers.\n\nCut off sageliness, discard wisdom—\nthe people will benefit a hundredfold.\nCut off benevolence, discard righteousness—\nthe people will return to filial piety and kindness.\nCut off skill, discard profit—\nthere will be no thieves or robbers.\nThese three sayings,\nas teachings, are insufficient.\nThus, let them have something to belong to:\nmanifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nreduce selfishness, diminish desires.\n\nAbandon learning, and there will be no sorrow.\nBetween “yes” and “ah”—\nhow much difference is there?\nBetween beauty and ugliness—\nhow much difference is there?\nWhat others fear,\none cannot but also fear.\nVast, it seems endless.\nThe multitude are joyous,\nas if partaking in a great sacrifice,\nas if ascending a terrace in spring.\nI alone am tranquil, without sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet smiled.\nWeary, as if with nowhere to return.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nI alone seem lacking.\nI have the heart of a fool—\nso muddled, so confused!\nThe common people are bright,\nI alone am dim.\nThe common people are sharp,\nI alone am dull.\nVast, like the sea,\nboundless, as if without end.\nThe multitude all have purpose,\nI alone am stubborn and uncouth.\nI alone differ from others,\nand value being nourished by the Mother.\n\nThe appearance of great virtue\nfollows only the Dao.\nThe thing of the Dao\nis elusive and evanescent.\nEvanescent, elusive—\nwithin it are images.\nElusive, evanescent—\nwithin it are things.\nProfound, obscure—\nwithin it is essence.\nIts essence is most real—\nwithin it is trust.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nits name does not depart,\nthrough which we observe the beginning of all things.\nHow do I know the beginning of all things?\nThrough this.\n\nProfound, obscure—\nwithin it is resonance.\nIts resonance most true—\nwithin it is trust.\nFrom present to ancient,\nits name does not depart,\nthrough which we follow the multitude of fathers.\nHow do I know the multitude of fathers?\nThrough this.\n\nOne who boasts cannot stand,\none who inspects himself cannot shine,\none who sees himself cannot be bright,\none who praises himself achieves no merit,\none who exalts himself does not endure.\nIn the Dao, these are called surplus food and superfluous conduct.\nSome things detest them,\nthus those with desire do not abide in them.\n\nBent, it becomes whole;\ncrooked, it becomes straight;\nhollow, it becomes full;\nworn, it becomes new;\nlittle, it gains;\nmuch, it confuses.\nTherefore the sage holds to the One\nand shepherds all under heaven.\nHe does not inspect himself, thus he shines;\nhe does not see himself, thus he is bright;\nhe does not praise himself, thus he achieves merit;\nhe does not exalt himself, thus he endures.\nIt is only because he does not contend\nthat none can contend with him.\nThe ancient saying \"bent becomes whole\"—\nhow could it be empty words?\nTruly, wholeness returns to it.\n\nFew words are natural.\nWhirlwinds do not last all morning,\ntorrential rains do not last all day.\nWho brings these about?\nHeaven and earth, yet they cannot endure long—\nhow much less can man!\n\nThus those who act in accord with the Dao\nare one with the Dao;\nthose with virtue are one with virtue;\nthose with loss are one with loss.\nOne with virtue, the Dao also embraces them.\nOne with loss, the Dao also loses them.\n\nThere is a thing formed in chaos,\nborn before heaven and earth.\nSilent, desolate—\nstanding alone, unchanging,\nit may be called the Mother of heaven and earth.\nI do not know its name;\nI style it \"Dao.\"\nForced to name it, I call it \"Great.\"\nGreat means passing on,\npassing on means far-reaching,\nfar-reaching means returning.\n\nThe Dao is great, heaven is great,\nearth is great, the king is also great.\nWithin the realm are four greats,\nand the king occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nearth models itself on heaven,\nheaven models itself on the Dao,\nthe Dao models itself on the natural.\n\nWeight is the root of lightness,\nstillness is the ruler of restlessness.\nThus the noble person travels all day\nwithout departing from his heavy supplies.\nThough he has towers and palaces,\nhe rests in clarity.\nHow could a lord of ten thousand chariots\nmake himself lighter than all under heaven?\nLightness loses the root,\nrestlessness loses the ruler.\n\nA good traveler leaves no tracks,\na good speaker makes no flaws,\na good reckoner uses no counting rods.\nA good closer needs no bolts or bars,\nyet none can open what he shuts.\nA good binder uses no cords or knots,\nyet none can untie what he ties.\nThus the sage is always good at saving people,\nand so abandons no one.\nThings are never abandoned—\nthis is called \"illuminating clarity.\"\nTherefore the good person\nis the teacher of the not-good.\nThe not-good person\nis the resource of the good.\nNot valuing one’s teacher,\nnot loving one’s resource—\nthough wise, this is great delusion.\nThis is called the essential subtlety.\n\nKnow the masculine,\nhold to the feminine,\nand be a ravine for all under heaven.\nAs a ravine for all under heaven,\nconstant virtue does not depart,\nand you return to infancy.\nKnow the white,\nhold to the black,\nand be a model for all under heaven.\nAs a model for all under heaven,\nconstant virtue is never wanting,\nand you return to the limitless.\nThe limitless disperses to become vessels,\nand the sage uses it to become a leader.\nThus the great system has no cuts.\n\nThose who would take all under heaven and act upon it—\nI see they will not succeed.\nAll under heaven is a sacred vessel,\nnot something to be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it ruin it;\nthose who grasp it lose it.\nThings may proceed, follow,\nbe warm, cool,\ngrow strong, or wither.\nThus the sage discards the excessive,\nthe extreme, the extravagant.\n\nTo assist a ruler with the Dao,\ndo not use arms to overpower all under heaven.\nSuch affairs tend to rebound.\nWhere armies camp,\nthorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great wars,\nyears of famine follow.\nThe good person achieves results and stops—\ndoes not dare to take by force.\nAchieve results but do not boast,\nachieve results but do not praise,\nachieve results but do not take credit,\nachieve results but do not dwell in them.\nThis is called achieving results without force.\nThings flourish then age—\nthis is called not-Dao.\nNot-Dao comes to an early end.\n\nArms are instruments of ill omen,\nsome things detest them,\nthus those with desire do not abide in them.\nThe noble person values the left in peace,\nbut values the right in war.\nThus arms are not the instruments of the noble.\nArms are instruments of ill omen—\nused only when unavoidable.\nSharpness and surprise are best,\ndo not glorify them.\nTo glorify them is to delight in killing.\nThose who delight in killing\ncannot achieve their will in all under heaven.\nThus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;\nin mourning, the right is honored.\nThus the deputy general stands on the left,\nthe supreme general on the right—\nspeaking as if conducting a funeral.\nWhen many are killed,\nmourn them with sorrow.\nWhen victorious in war,\nobserve it with mourning rites.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless,\nthe limitless is but small,\nyet none under heaven dare make it a subject.\nIf lords and kings can guard it,\nthe myriad things will submit of themselves.\nHeaven and earth unite\nto send down sweet dew.\nThe people, without command,\nnaturally become equal.\nWhen institutions begin, names arise;\nonce names exist,\nknow also to stop.\nKnowing to stop, one can avoid danger.\nThe Dao’s presence in all under heaven\nis like streams and valleys flowing to rivers and seas.\n\nTo know others is wisdom;\nto know oneself is clarity.\nTo overcome others requires force;\nto overcome oneself is strength.\nTo know contentment is wealth;\nto act with vigor is resolve.\nNot losing one’s place is endurance;\nto die without perishing is longevity.\n\nThe Dao flows everywhere,\nit may go left or right.\nIt accomplishes its tasks and completes its affairs,\nyet claims no possession.\nThe myriad things return to it,\nyet it does not act as master—\nthus it may be called small.\n\nThe myriad things return to it yet it does not act as master—\nthus it may be called great.\nTherefore the sage’s ability to accomplish greatness\nlies in not claiming greatness, and so achieves greatness.\n\nEmbracing the great image,\nall under heaven come.\nThey come without harm,\nand find peace and great tranquility.\n\nMusic and fine food\nmake the traveler pause.\nThus when the Dao speaks,\nit says: insipid, oh, it has no flavor;\nlooked at, it cannot be seen;\nlistened to, it cannot be heard;\nused, it cannot be exhausted.\n\nWhen you wish to contract something,\nyou must first expand it.\nWhen you wish to weaken something,\nyou must first strengthen it.\nWhen you wish to discard something,\nyou must first elevate it.\nWhen you wish to seize something,\nyou must first give it.\nThis is called subtle clarity.\nThe supple and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nFish must not leave the depths;\nthe state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others.\n\nThe Dao is ever without name.\nIf lords and kings can preserve it,\nthe myriad things will transform of themselves.\nTransformed yet desiring to act,\nI will restrain them with the nameless uncarved block.\nRestrained with the nameless uncarved block,\nthey will know no disgrace.\nWithout disgrace, in harmony with nature,\nheaven and earth will right themselves.",

      "translated_text": "From the *A Manuscript of the Chu Bamboo Slips*:\n\nAbandon cunning and discard partiality,\nAnd the people’s benefit will increase a hundredfold.\nAbandon artifice and discard profit,\nAnd thieves and bandits will vanish.\nAbandon deceit and discard scheming,\nAnd the people will return to filial piety.\n\nThese three sayings, as governing principles, are not enough—\nSome must be commanded, some must be guided.\nHold to simplicity and preserve uncarved wood,\nLessen selfishness and restrain desire.\n\nThe rivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nBecause they can place themselves below them—\nThus they become kings of all valleys.\nThe sage stands before the people,\nYet places himself behind them;\nStands above the people,\nYet speaks humbly to them.\nWhen he stands above the people,\nThey do not feel his weight.\nWhen he stands before the people,\nThey do not feel harmed.\nThe world delights in advancing him and never tires.\nBecause he does not contend,\nNo one in the world can contend with him.\n\nNo crime is graver than excessive desire;\nNo misfortune is worse than covetousness;\nNo calamity is greater than discontent.\nKnowing contentment as contentment—\nThis is everlasting contentment.\n\nThose who assist rulers with military force\nDo not desire to dominate the world by arms.\nGood outcomes are achieved and nothing more—\nNot used to seize power.\nAchieve and do not boast,\nAchieve and do not arrogantly display,\nAchieve and do not claim credit—\nThis is called achieving without dominating,\nAnd such conduct is excellent.\n\nOf old, those who excelled as knights\nWere profoundly subtle, deeply penetrating, too profound to be known.\nThus I describe them:\nCautious, as if crossing a winter stream;\nWary, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;\nRespectful, as if a guest;\nYielding, as if ice about to melt;\nSimple, as if uncarved wood;\nVast, as if a valley;\nTurbid, as if muddy water.\n\nWho can make the turbid clear?\nIt will gradually become clear.\nWho can make the still move?\nIt will gradually come to life.\nThose who preserve this Way do not desire fullness.\nBecause they do not desire fullness,\nThey can remain hidden and complete renewal.\n\nTo act is to fail;\nTo grasp is to lose.\nTherefore the sage does not act and does not fail,\nDoes not grasp and does not lose.\nIn managing affairs,\nBe as careful at the end as at the beginning—\nThen there will be no failure.\nThe sage desires what others do not desire,\nDoes not value rare goods;\nLearns what others do not learn,\nReturns to what the multitude has passed by.\nThus the sage can assist the self-so of the myriad things\nWithout presuming to act.\n\nThe Way is ever without action.\nIf lords and kings can hold to it,\nThe myriad things will transform themselves.\nTransforming yet desiring to arise,\nI would restrain them with nameless simplicity.\nNameless simplicity—\nThey too will know contentment,\nKnowing contentment, they will be at peace,\nAnd the myriad things will settle of themselves.\n\nAct without acting,\nManage without managing,\nTaste without tasting.\n\nThe great begins in the small;\nThe high begins at the base.\nWhat is to be felled begins as a sapling;\nA nine-tiered terrace rises from heaps of earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles begins beneath the feet.\n\nThose who know do not speak;\nThose who speak do not know.\nClose the gates,\nBlunt the edges,\nSoften the glare,\nMerge with the dust,\nFile down the projections,\nUntangle the knots—\nThis is called the Mysterious Sameness.\n\nHeaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew,\nWhich the people, without command, receive equally.\nWhen the system of names first arose,\nNames were established.\nOnce names exist,\nOne must also know when to stop—\nKnowing when to stop prevents peril.\n\nThe Way in the world\nIs like small streams flowing into rivers and seas.\nAll things come to completion,\nYet existed before heaven and earth.\nSilent, formless,\nStanding alone without change,\nIt can be called the Mother of the world.\nI do not know its name—\nI style it the Dao.\nForced to name it, I call it Great.\nGreat means passing on,\nPassing on means going far,\nGoing far means returning.\n\nHeaven is great, earth is great,\nThe Dao is great, the king is also great.\nWithin the realm there are four great things,\nAnd the king occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nEarth models itself on heaven,\nHeaven models itself on the Dao,\nThe Dao models itself on the self-so.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nIt is like a bellows—\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nThe more it moves, the more it yields.\nTo reach emptiness is the constant goal;\nTo guard centeredness is the firm practice.\nThe myriad things arise together,\nAnd I observe their return.\n\nAll things flourish and return to their root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nStillness is called submitting to fate.\nSubmitting to fate is the constant.\nTo know the constant is called illumination.\n\nIn its stability, it is easily disturbed;\nBefore signs appear, it is easily planned for;\nIn its fragility, it is easily broken;\nIn its subtlety, it is easily scattered.\nAct before it exists;\nGovern before disorder arises.\n\nA tree as great as a man’s embrace\nBegins as a tiny shoot.\nA nine-tiered terrace\nRises from heaps of earth.\nA height of a hundred fathoms\nBegins beneath the feet.",

      "translated_text": "This is called mysterious virtue.\nThe world has a beginning, which may be considered the mother of the world.\nHaving attained her, one may know her children;\nHaving known her children, one returns to guard their mother—\nThus one’s body does not perish to the end.\nBlock its openings, close its gates,\nAnd to the end of life there will be no toil.\nOpen its openings, meddle in its affairs,\nAnd to the end of life there will be no rescue.\n\nTo see the small is called discernment;\nTo guard the soft is called strength.\nUsing its light, one returns to its clarity,\nWithout leaving the body in peril—\nThis is called practicing the constant.\n\nWhen I seem to have knowledge,\nI walk the great Dao alone, fearing only to stray.\nThe great Dao is very level,\nYet the people delight in byways.\nThe court is very splendid,\nFields are very weedy,\nGranaries are very empty.\nThey wear fine clothes,\nCarry sharp swords,\nSate themselves with food and drink,\nPossess wealth in abundance—\nThese are called thieves’ boasts.\nFar indeed is this from the Dao!\n\nWhat is well planted cannot be uprooted;\nWhat is well embraced cannot slip away.\nThus from generation to generation its ancestral sacrifices will never cease.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;\nCultivate it in the family, and its virtue overflows;\nCultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;\nCultivate it in the state, and its virtue is abundant;\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.\nTherefore:\nObserve the self through the self;\nObserve the family through the family;\nObserve the village through the village;\nObserve the state through the state;\nObserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is so?\nBy this.\n\nIts richness is like that of an infant:\nPoisonous insects do not sting it,\nFierce beasts do not seize it,\nBirds of prey do not strike it.\nIts bones are weak, its sinews soft,\nYet its grasp is firm.\nIt does not yet know the union of male and female,\nYet its vital essence is complete—\nSo perfect is its vitality.\nIt cries all day without growing hoarse—\nSo perfect is its harmony.\n\nTo know harmony is called the constant;\nTo know the constant is called clarity.\nTo enhance life is called auspicious;\nFor the mind to command the qi is called strength.\nWhen things reach their prime, they grow old—\nThis is called not following the Dao.\nWhat does not follow the Dao perishes early.\n\nBlock its openings, close its gates,\nDull its sharpness,\nUntangle its knots,\nSoften its glare,\nMerge with its dust—\nThis is called mysterious sameness.\nThus one cannot be drawn near or kept at a distance,\nCannot be benefited or harmed,\nCannot be valued or debased—\nTherefore it is honored by the world.\n\nGovern the state with uprightness,\nDeploy the army with surprise,\nTake the world with non-interference.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nThe more taboos in the world,\nThe poorer the people;\nThe more sharp tools the people have,\nThe more troubled the state and family;\nThe more cunning the people,\nThe more strange things arise;\nThe more laws and decrees are promulgated,\nThe more thieves and bandits appear.\nTherefore the sage says:\nI do nothing, and the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, and the people right themselves;\nI do not meddle, and the people prosper themselves;\nI desire not to desire, and the people of themselves become simple as uncarved wood.\n\nWhen the government is dull and opaque,\nThe people are pure and simple;\nWhen the government is sharp and intrusive,\nThe people are lacking and deficient.\nCalamity is the support of fortune;\nFortune is the concealment of calamity.\nWho knows their ultimate point?\nIs there no uprightness?\nThe upright reverts to the strange,\nThe good reverts to the ominous—\nThe delusion of the people has indeed been long.\n\nTherefore the sage is square but not cutting,\nSharp but not piercing,\nStraight but not overbearing,\nBright but not dazzling.\n\nTo govern a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the world is governed by the Dao,\nIts ghosts do not haunt.\nNot that its ghosts are not numinous,\nBut their numinosity does not harm people;\nNot only do their numinosity not harm people,\nThe sage also does not harm them.\nAs neither harms the other,\nVirtue converges in them.\n\nA great state is the lower reaches of a river—\nThe female of the world,\nThe confluence of the world.\nThe female always overcomes the male by stillness,\nAnd by stillness is the lower.\nThus if a great state places itself below a small one,\nIt takes the small state;\nIf a small state places itself below a great one,\nIt is taken by the great state.\nThus some place themselves below to take,\nSome place themselves below and are taken.\nA great state desires nothing more than to unite and nurture people;\nA small state desires nothing more than to enter and serve people.\nBoth obtain what they desire,\nBut the great state must place itself below.\n\nThe Dao of heaven benefits and does not harm;\nThe Dao of the sage acts and does not contend.\nThe good man is the refuge of the world,\nThe refuge of the not-good man.",

What is called valuing great misfortune as if it were the body? My having great misfortune is because I have a body; when I have no body, what misfortune could there be? Thus, one who values the body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes the body for the sake of the world may be given the world.\n\nLook at it yet do not see—call it the Subtle;\nListen to it yet do not hear—call it the Rare;\nGrasp it yet do not obtain—call it the Minute.\nThese three cannot be fully fathomed,\nThus they merge into one.\nIts rising brings no light,\nIts sinking brings no darkness,\nUnceasing, unnameable,\nIt returns to nothingness—\nThis is called the form of the formless,\nThe image of nothingness.\nThis is called the indistinct and shadowy.\nFollow it yet do not see its back,\nGrasp it yet do not see its front.\nHold to the Dao of the present to master what is present,\nTo know the ancient beginning—\nThis is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nProfound, unfathomable!\nOnly because it is unfathomable,\nI forcefully describe its appearance:\nHesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;\nCautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;\nReserved, as if a guest;\nDispersing, as if melting ice;\nSimple, as if uncarved wood;\nVast, as if a valley;\nTurbid, as if muddy water.\nWho can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?\nWho can stir the still and gradually bring it to life?\nOne who preserves this Dao does not desire fullness—\nOnly because of not desiring fullness,\nCan one remain unspoiled and complete.\n\nAll things arise side by side,\nI thereby observe their return.\nAll things flourish,\nEach returns to its root—\nThis is called returning to destiny,\nReturning to destiny is constancy.\nKnowing constancy is enlightenment;\nNot knowing constancy leads to recklessness and disaster.\nKnowing constancy is all-embracing;\nAll-embracing is impartial;\nImpartial is kingly;\nKingly is heavenly;\nHeavenly is the Dao;\nDao is enduring—\nOne’s body may perish, but one does not.\n\nThe highest rulers—people know they exist;\nThe next—people love and praise them;\nThe next—people fear them;\nThe lowest—people despise them.\nIf trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.\nHow careful they are with their words!\nWhen tasks are accomplished and affairs completed,\nThe people all say, “We are naturally so.”\nWhen the great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise;\nWhen wisdom and cunning emerge, great hypocrisy follows;\nWhen the six relations are disharmonious, filial piety and kindness appear;\nWhen the state is in chaos, loyal ministers emerge.\nCut off sagacity, abandon knowledge—people will benefit a hundredfold;\nCut off benevolence, abandon righteousness—people will return to filial piety and kindness;\nCut off skill, abandon profit—thieves and robbers will disappear.\nThese three sayings, as cultural refinements, are insufficient,\nThus let them have something to which they belong:\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nReduce self-interest, diminish desires.\n\nWhat is the difference between approval and disdain?\nWhat is the difference between good and evil?\nWhat others fear, I too must fear—\nHow boundless this seems!\nThe people all rejoice,\nAs if feasting at a great sacrifice,\nAs if ascending a tower in spring.\nI alone remain unmoved,\nLike an infant who has not yet smiled,\nWeary, as if with no place to return.\nThe people all have more than enough,\nI alone seem lacking.\nI have the mind of a fool—how muddled!\nThe common people are bright,\nI alone am dim.\nThe common people are discerning,\nI alone am dull.\nVast, like the sea,\nCeaseless, like the wind,\nThe people all have purpose,\nI alone am stubborn and rustic.\nI alone differ from others,\nAnd value being nourished by the Mother.\n\nThe power of profound virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe things of the Dao are indistinct and shadowy—\nShadowy, yet within there are images;\nIndistinct, yet within there are forms;\nObscure, yet within there is essence;\nIts essence is most real,\nWithin it there is trust.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nIts name does not depart,\nTo observe the source of all things.\nHow do I know the nature of all things?\nBy this.\n\nOne who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;\nOne who takes long strides cannot walk far;\nOne who displays himself is not enlightened;\nOne who justifies himself has no merit;\nOne who boasts of himself does not endure.\nIn the Dao, these are called excess food and superfluous action—\nThings may despise them.\nThus, one who possesses the Dao does not abide in them.\nThe crooked will be made whole;\nThe bent will be straightened;\nThe hollow will be filled;\nThe worn will be renewed;\nThe few will gain;\nThe many will be confused.\nThus the sage holds to the One and governs the world.\nHe does not display himself, thus is enlightened;\nHe does

      "translated_text": "Thus, knowledge is the state’s thief,\nwhile unknowing is the state’s virtue.\nEver knowing these two is also a model—\never knowing this model:\nthis is called the profound virtue,\ndeep and far-reaching.\nThings return,\nand so reach great compliance.\n\nThe Jiang and the sea can be kings of the hundred valleys\nbecause they excel at being below them—\nthus they can be kings of the hundred valleys.\nTherefore, when the sage desires to be above the people,\nthey must place their words below them;\nwhen they desire to lead the people,\nthey must place themselves behind them.\nThus, though dwelling above, the people do not find them burdensome;\nthough dwelling ahead, the people do not find them harmful.\nThe world all delights in them and does not weary.\nBecause they do not contend,\nno one in the world can contend with them.\n\nLet a small state have few people—\nlet it have tools for ten or a hundred yet not use them;\nlet the people value death and not travel far.\nThough there be boats and carriages, none ride them;\nthough there be armor and weapons, none display them.\nLet the people return to knotting cords and using them.\nSweet be their food,\nbeautiful their clothing,\npeaceful their customs,\ncontent their dwellings.\nNeighboring states may gaze upon one another,\nthe sounds of their dogs and chickens heard,\nyet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.\n\nTrue words are not fine;\nfine words are not true.\nThe knowing are not learned;\nthe learned are not knowing.\nThe good are not many;\nthe many are not good.\n\nThe sage accumulates nothing—\nhaving given all to others, they have more;\nhaving bestowed all on others, they have abundance.\nThus, the Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm;\nthe Dao of Humankind acts yet does not contend.\n\nThe world calls me great,\nyet I seem lacking.\nIt is because I seem lacking that I am great—\nhad I been full, long since would I have been small.\nI ever have three treasures,\nwhich I hold and cherish:\nthe first is compassion,\nthe second is frugality,\nthe third is not daring to be first in the world.\nWith compassion, one can be brave;\nwith frugality, one can be expansive;\nnot daring to be first in the world,\none can become the vessel of leadership.\n\nNow, abandon compassion and yet be brave,\nabandon frugality and yet be expansive,\nabandon the rear and yet be first—\nthis is death.\nFor with compassion, in attack there is victory,\nin defense there is solidity.\nHeaven will establish one\nas if surrounding them with compassion.\n\nThus, the good warrior is not martial,\nthe good fighter is not enraged,\nthe good conqueror does not contend,\nthe good employer of others places themselves below.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthis is called employing others,\nthis is called matching Heaven—\nthe ultimate of old.\n\nOn the use of arms, it is said:\n\"I dare not be the host but act as guest;\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"\nThis is called marching without marching,\nraising arms without arms,\ngrasping weapons without weapons,\nfacing enemies without enemies.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy—\nunderestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasures.\nThus, when evenly matched armies meet,\nthe grieving side prevails.\n\nMy words are easy to know,\neasy to practice,\nyet none in the world can know them,\nnone can practice them.\nWords have a source,\naffairs have a lord.\nIt is only through unknowing\nthat they do not know me.\nThose who know me are few—\nthus I am esteemed.\nTherefore, the sage wears coarse cloth yet holds jade.\n\nTo know yet seem not to know is excellence;\nnot to know yet think one knows is sickness.\nOnly by regarding this sickness as sickness\ncan one be without sickness.\nThe people’s not fearing\nmeans great fear is coming.\n\nDo not cramp their dwelling,\ndo not weary their livelihood.\nOnly by not wearying them\ncan one avoid weariness.\nThus, the sage knows themselves yet does not display themselves,\nloves themselves yet does not prize themselves.\nTherefore, they discard the latter and take the former.\n\nBe brave in daring, and you will be killed;\nbe brave in not daring, and you will live.\nOf these two, one brings benefit, one brings harm.\nHeaven’s disdain—who knows the reason?\nThus, the Dao of Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory,\ndoes not speak yet excels at response,\nis not summoned yet comes of itself,\nis at ease yet excels at planning.\nHeaven’s net is vast—\nwide-meshed yet nothing slips through.\n\nIf the people ever cease to fear death,\nhow can killing be used to threaten them?\nIf the people ever must fear death,\nthen those who act perversely—\nwho can seize and kill them?\nIf the people ever must fear death,\nthere is always an executioner.\nTo kill in place of the executioner\nis like hewing in place of the master carpenter—\nthose who hew in place of the master carpenter\nrarely avoid injuring their hands.\n\nThe people’s hunger\ncomes from their rulers’ excessive taxation—\nthus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed\ncomes from their superiors’ meddling—\nthus they are ungovernable.\nThe people’s disregard for death\ncomes from their rulers’ excessive pursuit of life—\nthus they disregard death.\nOnly those who do not act for the sake of life\nsurpass those who prize life.\n\nOf all things in the world,\nnone is more supple and weak than water,\nyet none excels it in overcoming the hard and strong—\nnothing can take its place.\nThe weak overcomes the strong,\nthe supple overcomes the rigid.\nThe world knows this,\nyet none can practice it.\n\nThus, the strong and rigid are companions of death,\nthe supple and weak are companions of life.\nTherefore, when arms are strong, they are not victorious;\nwhen trees are strong, they break.\nThe great and strong dwell below,\nthe supple and weak dwell above.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow:\nthe high is pressed down,\nthe low is raised up.\nWhat has excess is reduced,\nwhat is deficient is supplemented.\nThe Dao of Humankind is not so—\nit reduces the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can take excess and offer it to the world?\nOnly one who has the Dao.\n\nThus, the sage acts yet does not possess,\naccomplishes yet does not dwell.\nIn this way, they do not desire to display their worth.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing excels it in overcoming the hard and strong—\nnothing can replace it.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the presence of things brings advantage,\nwhile their absence brings utility.\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe chase of hunting and racing maddens the heart,\nrare treasures distort conduct,\nthe five flavors dull the palate,\nthe five tones deafen the ears.\n\nTherefore, the sage governs for the belly, not for the eyes—\nthus, he discards the one and embraces the other.\nFavor and disgrace are like terror;\nregard great calamity as one’s own body.\nWhat does it mean, \"favor and disgrace are like terror\"?\nFavor is base—\ngained, it brings terror;\nlost, it brings terror.\nThis is what is meant by \"favor and disgrace are like terror.\"\nWhat does it mean, \"regard great calamity as one’s own body\"?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nis that I have a body.\nWhen I no longer have a body,\nwhat calamity could there be?\nThus, one who values the body as the world\nmay be entrusted with the world;\none who loves the body as the world\nmay be relied upon with the world.\n\nLook at it and it cannot be seen—\nit is called the Subtle.\nListen to it and it cannot be heard—\nit is called the Rare.\nGrasp it and it cannot be held—\nit is called the Elusive.\nThese three cannot be fully fathomed,\nthus they merge into the One.\nIts rising is not bright,\nits sinking is not dark.\nUnceasing, unnameable,\nit returns to nothingness—\nthis is called the formless form,\nthe image of nothingness.\nThis is called the Vague and Elusive.\nEncounter it and you do not see its front,\nfollow it and you do not see its back.\nHold to the ancient Dao to master present existence,\nto know the ancient beginning—\nthis is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe ancients who practiced the Dao\nwere subtle, mysterious, profound, and penetrating—\ntoo deep to be known.\nIt is only because they cannot be known\nthat I am forced to describe them:\nHesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;\ncautious, as if fearing all around;\nsolemn, as if a guest;\nyielding, as if ice about to melt;\nsimple, as if uncarved wood;\nhollow, as if a valley;\nopaque, as if turbid.\nWho can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?\nWho can rouse the still and gradually bring it to life?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness—\nonly because they do not desire fullness\nare they able to remain hidden and not be exhausted.\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nmaintain utter stillness.\nThe ten thousand things arise together,\nand I observe their return.\nAll things flourish,\neach returning to its root—\nthis is called stillness,\nand stillness is called returning to destiny.\nReturning to destiny is called constancy.\nKnowing constancy is called clarity.\nNot knowing constancy leads to recklessness and disaster.\nKnowing constancy is all-embracing,\nall-embracing is impartial,\nimpartial is kingly,\nkingly is heavenly,\nheavenly is the Dao,\nthe Dao is enduring—\nthough the body perishes, it is not destroyed.\n\nWhen the great Dao is abandoned,\nthen benevolence and righteousness appear.\nWhen wisdom and intelligence emerge,\nthen great hypocrisy arises.\nWhen the six relations are not in harmony,\nthen filial piety and kindness appear.\nWhen the state is in chaos and turmoil,\nthen loyal ministers emerge.\nCut off sagacity, discard knowledge,\nand the people will benefit a hundredfold.\nCut off benevolence, discard righteousness,\nand the people will return to filial piety and kindness.\nCut off skill, discard profit,\nand there will be no thieves or robbers.\nThese three sayings are not sufficient as teachings—\nthus, let them have something to belong to:\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nreduce self-interest, diminish desires.\nCut off learning, and there will be no worries.\nHow much difference is there between \"yes\" and \"ah\"?\nHow much difference is there between good and evil?\nWhat people fear cannot but be feared—\nhow vast and endless it is!\nThe multitude are joyous,\nas if partaking in a great feast,\nas if ascending a terrace in spring.\nI alone am tranquil, showing no sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet smiled.\nWeary, as if with nowhere to return.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nwhile I alone seem lacking.\nI have the heart of a fool—\nhow muddled!\nThe common people are bright,\nwhile I alone am dim.\nThe common people are discerning,\nwhile I alone am dull.\nVast, like the sea;\nceaseless, like the wind.\nThe multitude all have their use,\nwhile I alone am stubborn and rustic.\nI alone differ from others\nand value being nourished by the Mother.\n\nThe power of great virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe things of the Dao are vague and elusive—\nvague and elusive,\nyet within them is form;\nelusive and vague,\nyet within them is substance;\ndim and dark,\nyet within them is essence.\nThis essence is most real,\nand within it is trust.\nFrom ancient times until now,\nits name has never departed,\nthrough which we may see the beginning of all things.\nHow do I know the beginning of all things?\nBy this.\n\nThose who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm;\nthose who take long strides cannot walk far.\nThose who display themselves are not enlightened;\nthose who assert themselves are not distinguished;\nthose who boast of themselves have no merit;\nthose who are self-righteous do not endure.\nIn the Dao, these are called\n\"excessive food and superfluous conduct\"—\nthings that are detested.\nThus, those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.\nTo be bent is to be preserved whole;\nto be crooked is to be straightened;\nto be hollow is to be filled;\nto be worn is to be renewed;\nto have little is to gain;\nto have much is to be confused.\nTherefore, the sage embraces the One\nand becomes the shepherd of the world.\nHe does not display himself, thus he is enlightened;\nhe does not assert himself, thus he is distinguished;\nhe does not boast, thus he has merit;\nhe is not self-righteous, thus he endures.\nIt is only because he does not contend\nthat no one in the world can contend with him.\nThe ancient saying, \"To be bent is to be preserved whole\"—\nhow could it be empty words?\nTruly, to be preserved whole is to return to it.\n\nGentle winds do not last all morning;\nsudden rains do not last all day.\nWho is it that makes these?\nHeaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth cannot make things last,\nhow much less can man?\nThus, those who follow the Dao\nunite with the Dao;\nthose who follow virtue unite with virtue;\nthose who lose it unite with loss.\nThose who unite with virtue,\nthe Dao also unites with them;\nthose who unite with loss,\nthe Dao also unites with them.\n\nThere is a thing, chaotic yet complete,\nborn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and void,\nit stands alone and does not change.\nIt revolves without endangerment,\nand may be considered the mother of heaven and earth.\nI do not know its name—\nI style it \"Dao,\"\nand forcibly name it \"Great.\"\nGreat means passing,\npassing means far-reaching,\nfar-reaching means returning.\nThus, the Dao is great,\nheaven is great,\nearth is great,\nand the king is also great.\nWithin the realm, there are four greats,\nand the king occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nearth models itself on heaven,\nheaven models itself on the Dao,\nand the Dao models itself on nature.\n\nWeight is the root of lightness;\nstillness is the ruler of motion.\nThus, the noble person travels all day\nwithout leaving his heavy supplies.\nThough he may have splendid lodgings,\nhe remains tranquil and detached.\nHow could a ruler of ten thousand chariots\ntreat his own person lightly before the world?\nTo be light is to lose the root;\nto be hasty is to lose the ruler.\n\nGood traveling leaves no tracks;\ngood speech leaves no flaws;\ngood reckoning uses no counting rods;\ngood closure needs no bolt,\nyet cannot be opened;\ngood knotting needs no rope,\nyet cannot be untied.\nThus, the sage is always good at saving people,\nand so abandons no one;\nalways good at saving things,\nand so abandons nothing.\nThis is called following enlightenment.\nThus, the good person is the teacher of the not-good,\nand the not-good is the resource of the good.\nNot to value one’s teacher,\nnot to love one’s resource—\nthough knowledgeable, this is great delusion.\nThis is called the essential subtlety.\n\nKnow the masculine, keep to the feminine,\nand be the ravine of the world.\nBeing the ravine of the world,\nconstant virtue does not depart,\nand one returns to infancy.\nKnow the white, keep to the black,\nand be the pattern of the world.\nBeing the pattern of the world,\nconstant virtue does not err,\nand one returns to the limitless.\nKnow the glorious, keep to the humble,\nand be the valley of the world.\nBeing the valley of the world,\nconstant virtue is sufficient,\nand one returns to simplicity.\nWhen simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels;\nthe sage uses it and becomes the chief of officials.\nThus, the great system does not cut.\nDesiring to take the world,\none must act without action—\nfor the world is a sacred vessel.",

reason I have great calamity is that I have a body;\nif I were without a body, what calamity could I have?\nThus, one who values the body as the world may be entrusted with the world;\none who loves the body as the world may be given charge of the world.\n\nLook at it and it cannot be seen—it is called the Subtle;\nlisten to it and it cannot be heard—it is called the Rare;\ngrasp it and it cannot be held—it is called the Elusive.\nThese three cannot be fully fathomed,\nso they merge into one.\nIts rising brings no light,\nits setting brings no darkness.\nEndless, unnameable,\nit returns to nothingness—\nthis is called the form of the formless,\nthe image of nothingness.\nThis is called the elusive and evanescent,\nmeeting it, one does not see its head;\nfollowing it, one does not see its rear.\nHold to the Dao of the present to master what is present,\nand thus know the ancient beginning—\nthis is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nOf old, those skilled in the Dao were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating,\ntoo deep to be known.\nIt is only because they cannot be known\nthat I am compelled to describe their appearance:\nHesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;\ncautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;\nrespectful, as if a guest;\ndissolving, as if ice melting;\nsimple, as if uncarved wood;\nhollow, as if a valley;\nopaque, as if turbid.\nWho can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?\nWho can rouse the still and gradually bring it to life?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\nOnly because they do not desire fullness\nare they able to be worn yet not newly made.\n\nAll things arise side by side,\nand I observe their return.\nAll things flourish in abundance,\neach returning to its root—\nthis is called stillness.\nStillness is called returning to destiny;\nreturning to destiny is called the constant.\nKnowing the constant is called illumination.\nNot knowing the constant leads to recklessness and disaster.\nKnowing the constant allows for acceptance;\nacceptance leads to impartiality;\nimpartiality leads to kingship;\nkingship leads to heaven;\nheaven leads to the Dao;\nthe Dao leads to enduring—\none’s body may perish, but one does not come to great harm.\n\nIn highest antiquity, the people knew only that rulers existed;\nnext, they loved and praised them;\nnext, they feared them;\nnext, they despised them.\nWhen trust is insufficient, distrust arises.\nHow careful they were with their words!\nWhen tasks were accomplished and affairs completed,\nthe people all said, “We are naturally so.”\n\nWhen the great Dao declined, benevolence and righteousness arose;\nwhen knowledge and wisdom emerged, great hypocrisy followed;\nwhen the six relations fell into disharmony, filial piety and kindness appeared;\nwhen the state and family fell into chaos, loyal ministers emerged.\n\nCut off sageness, discard knowledge, and the people will benefit a hundredfold;\ncut off benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness;\ncut off skill, discard profit, and thieves and robbers will disappear.\nThese three sayings, as teachings, are not sufficient—\ntherefore, let them have something to which they belong:\nmanifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nreduce self-interest, diminish desires.\nCut off learning, and there will be no worries.\n\nHow far apart are “only this” and “how much more”?\nHow far apart are beauty and ugliness?\nWhat others fear, one must not fail to fear—\nhow vast, how endless!\nThe people all rejoice as if feasting at the Great Sacrifice,\nas if ascending the springtime terrace.\nI alone remain unmoved, like an infant who has not yet smiled,\nweary, as if with nowhere to return.\nThe people all have more than enough,\nwhile I alone seem bereft.\nI have the mind of a fool—how muddled!\nThe common people are bright,\nwhile I alone am dim.\nThe common people are discerning,\nwhile I alone am dull.\nBoundless, like the sea,\nceaseless, like the ceaseless wind—\nthe people all have their uses,\nwhile I alone am stubborn and rustic.\nI alone differ from others\nand value being nourished by the Mother.\n\nThe power of the profoundest virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe things of the Dao are elusive and evanescent—\nelusive, evanescent,\nyet within them are images;\nevanescent, elusive,\nyet within them are entities;\nprofound, obscure,\nyet within them is essence.\nThis essence is most genuine,\nand within it is trust.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nits name has never departed,\nby which we may observe the origins of all things.\nHow do I know the nature of these origins?\nBy this.\n\nThat which does not stand on tiptoe is firm;\nthat which does not peer ahead is bright;\nthat which does not boast of itself achieves merit;\nthat which does not praise itself endures.\nIt is only because it does not contend\nthat nothing in the world can contend with it.\nThe ancient saying, “That which is bent will be preserved whole,”\nhow could it be empty words?\nTruly, it will be preserved and return to wholeness.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One;\nthe One gives birth to two;\ntwo gives birth to three;\nthree gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nblending their qi to attain harmony.\nWhat people dislike is to be orphaned, widowed, or destitute,\nyet kings and lords call themselves by these names.\nThus, things may be diminished yet thereby increased,\nor increased yet thereby diminished.\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n“A violent man does not die a natural death.”\nI will make this the father of my teaching.\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light;\nthe still is the ruler of the restless.\nThus, the noble person travels all day without leaving the heavy supplies.\nThough there may be splendid sights,\nthey remain calmly detached.\nHow could a lord of ten thousand chariots\ntreat his own person lightly in the world?\nIf he treats it lightly, he loses the root;\nif he is restless, he loses the ruler.\n\nA good traveler leaves no tracks;\na good speaker makes no slips;\na good reckoner uses no tallies;\na good closer needs no bolts, yet none can open;\na good binder needs no cords, yet none can loosen.\nThus, the sage is always good at saving people,\nand so abandons no one;\nalways good at saving things,\nand so abandons nothing—\nthis is called inheriting illumination.\nTherefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good;\nthe not-good is the resource of the good.\nNot to value

the Three;\nthe Three gives birth to the ten thousand things.\nThe ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang,\nblending their qi to attain harmony.\n\nWhat people despise—\nbeing orphaned, widowed, or unworthy—\nkings and lords use as their titles.\nThus, some things are diminished yet gain,\nwhile others are increased yet lose.\nWhat people teach,\nI too teach:\n“A violent man does not die a natural death.”\nI will take this as the father of my teaching.\n\nThe softest under heaven\ngallops through the hardest under heaven.\nNonbeing enters where there is no space.\nThus I know the benefit of nonaction.\nTeaching without words,\nbenefit without action—\nfew under heaven can attain this.\n\nWhich is dearer, name or self?\nWhich is greater, self or wealth?\nWhich is more harmful, gain or loss?\nExcessive love incurs great cost;\nhoarding much invites heavy loss.\nKnow contentment and avoid disgrace;\nknow restraint and avoid danger—\nthus can one endure long.\n\nGreat accomplishment seems incomplete,\nyet its use is never exhausted.\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nyet its use is never depleted.\nGreat straightness seems bent;\ngreat skill seems clumsy;\ngreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\nMovement overcomes cold;\nstillness overcomes heat.\nPurity and tranquility set the world right.\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao,\nwarhorses are retired to fertilize fields.\nWhen the world loses the Dao,\nmares give birth on the battlefield.\nNo crime is greater than indulging desire;\nno disaster is greater than discontent;\nno fault is greater than covetousness.\nThus, knowing contentment’s contentment\nis ever content.\n\nWithout stepping outside one’s door,\none may know the world.\nWithout peering through one’s window,\none may know the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\nTherefore the sage knows without traveling,\nnames without seeing,\ncompletes without acting.\n\nScholars daily accumulate;\nthose who hear the Dao daily diminish.\nDiminish and further diminish,\nuntil reaching nonaction.\nThrough nonaction,\nnothing is left undone.\nTo take the world,\none must always act without contrivance.\nWith contrivance,\none is not fit to take the world.\n\nThe sage always takes the heart of the common people as his heart.\nThose who are good, I treat as good;\nthose who are not good, I also treat as good—\nthus attaining goodness.\nThose who are trustworthy, I trust;\nthose who are untrustworthy, I also trust—\nthus attaining trustworthiness.\nThe sage in the world\nblends his heart with all under heaven.\nAll people fix their ears and eyes upon him,\nand the sage treats them as children.\n\nBirth and death:\nthirteen parts belong to life,\nthirteen parts belong to death.\nYet people’s lives all lead to death’s realm—\nthirteen parts again.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they cling to life too tightly.\n\nI have heard that one who skillfully preserves life\nwalks through the mountains without fearing rhinoceros or tiger,\nenters battle without armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to gore him;\nthe tiger finds no place to claw him;\nweapons find no place to pierce him.\nWhy is this?\nBecause he has no place for death to enter.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to them;\nvirtue nurtures them;\nthings shape them;\ncircumstances complete them.\nThus the ten thousand things honor the Dao and value virtue.\nThe Dao is honored,\nvirtue is valued—\nnot by command, but by nature.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to them,\nnurtures them, rears them,\nmatures them, ripens them,\nsustains them, and protects them.\nIt gives birth without possessing,\nacts without claiming,\nleads without dominating—\nthis is called profound virtue.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich we take as the world’s mother.\nOnce we know the mother,\nwe may know her children.\nOnce we know the children,\nwe return to guard the mother—\nand to the end of life, no harm.\nBlock the openings,\nshut the doors—\nand to the end of life, no toil.\nOpen the openings,\nmeddle in affairs—\nand to the end of life, no rescue.\n\nSeeing the small is called clarity;\nguarding the soft is called strength.\nUse its light,\nreturn to clarity—\nleave no disaster for the self.\nThis is called following the constant.\n\nIf I had the slightest knowledge,\nwalking the great Dao,\nI would fear only straying from it.\nThe great Dao is smooth,\nyet people prefer shortcuts.\nThe court is immaculate,\nthe fields are overgrown,\nthe granaries are empty.\nThey wear fine robes,\ncarry sharp swords,\nsurfeit themselves with food and drink,\npossess wealth in excess—\nthese are the ways of banditry.\nThis is not the Dao.\n\nWhat is well planted cannot be uprooted;\nwhat is well embraced cannot slip away.\nThus descendants will continue ancestral sacrifices without end.\nCultivate it in yourself—\nyour virtue will be genuine.\nCultivate it in your family—\nyour virtue will overflow.\nCultivate it in your village—\nyour virtue will endure.\nCultivate it in your state—\nyour virtue will flourish.\nCultivate it in the world—\nyour virtue will be universal.\n\nThus observe the self through the self;\nobserve the family through the family;\nobserve the state through the state;\nobserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is so?\nBy this.\n\nOne whose virtue is profound\nis like an infant:\nwasps, scorpions, vipers, and snakes do not sting him;\nbirds of prey and wild beasts do not seize him.\nHis bones are weak, his sinews soft,\nyet his grip is firm.\nHe does not yet know the union of male and female,\nyet his organ stirs—\nso full is his essence.\nHe cries all day without growing hoarse—\nso perfect is his harmony.\n\nKnowing harmony is called constancy;\nknowing constancy is called clarity.\nExcessive vitality is called ill-omen;\nthe heart forcing qi is called violence.\nThings in their prime soon age—\nthis is called not following the Dao.\nNot following the Dao leads to early demise.\n\nThose who know do not speak;\nthose who speak do not know.\nBlock the openings,\nshut the doors,\nblunt the sharpness,\nuntie the tangles,\nsoften the glare,\nmerge with the dust—\nthis is called mysterious sameness.\n\nThus one cannot be too close,\nnor too distant;\ncannot be benefited,\nnor harmed;\ncannot be valued,\nnor despised.\nTherefore, it is honored under heaven.\n\nGovern the state with uprightness;\nwage war with surprise;\ntake the world with noncontrivance.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nThe more taboos in the world,\nthe poorer the people.\nThe more sharp tools the people have,\nthe more benighted the state.\nThe more cunning people are,\nthe more strange things arise.\nThe more laws are promulgated,\nthe more thieves and bandits appear.\n\nTherefore the sage says:\nI practice nonaction, and the people transform themselves;\nI love tranquility, and the people right themselves;\nI do not meddle, and the people prosper themselves;\nI desire not to desire, and the people return to simplicity.\n\nWhen the ruler is upright,\nthe people are simple;\nwhen the ruler is perceptive,\nthe state is secure.\nGood fortune and misfortune\nlie in the same place—\nwho knows their limit?\nThere is no constancy.\nUprightness reverts to perversity,\ngoodness reverts to evil.\nPeople’s delusion\nhas lasted long indeed.\n\nThus the sage is square but not cutting,\nsharp but not piercing,\nstraight but not overbearing,\nbright but not dazzling.",

      "translated_text": "Higher virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue.\nLower virtue does not lose virtue, and thus lacks virtue.\nHigher virtue acts not and has no purpose in acting.\nHigher benevolence acts but has no purpose in acting.\nHigher righteousness acts and has purpose in acting.\nHigher ritual acts, yet none respond—\nthen one rolls up sleeves and forces compliance.\nThus the Way is lost.\n\nWhen the Way is lost, then comes virtue;\nwhen virtue is lost, then comes benevolence;\nwhen benevolence is lost, then comes righteousness;\nwhen righteousness is lost, then comes ritual.\nRitual is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nthe beginning of chaos.\nForeknowledge is the flower of the Way,\nthe beginning of folly.\nTherefore the great man dwells in the thick, not in the thin;\nin the solid, not in the flowery.\nThus he discards the latter and takes the former.\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil;\nspirits attained the One and became numinous;\nvalleys attained the One and became full;\nlords and kings attained the One and became upright.\nThis is how they attained it.\nIf Heaven were not clear, it would fear to rend;\nif Earth were not tranquil, it would fear to quake;\nif spirits were not numinous, they would fear to vanish;\nif valleys were not full, they would fear to dry;\nif lords and kings were not noble and exalted, they would fear to fall.\nThus the noble must take the lowly as its root,\nthe high must take the low as its foundation.\nTherefore lords and kings call themselves \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"destitute\"—\nthis is taking the lowly as their root, is it not?\nThus attaining the utmost in praise is to receive no praise.\nTherefore do not desire to be jingling like jade,\nnor clattering like stone.\n\nThe highest scholar, hearing the Way, diligently practices it.\nThe middling scholar, hearing the Way, sometimes keeps it, sometimes loses it.\nThe lowest scholar, hearing the Way, laughs loudly at it.\nIf it were not laughed at, it would not be the Way.\nThus the established sayings have it:\nThe bright Way seems dim;\nthe advancing Way seems to retreat;\nthe level Way seems uneven.\nHigher virtue seems like a valley;\ngreat whiteness seems sullied;\nabundant virtue seems insufficient.\nEstablished virtue seems unsteady;\ntrue substance seems fickle;\nthe great square has no corners;\nthe great vessel is slow to form;\nthe great tone has scarce sound.\nThe heavenly image has no form;\nthe Way, though vast, has no name.\nOnly the Way is good at beginning and good at completing.\n\nReversion is the movement of the Way;\nweakness is the function of the Way.\nThe myriad things of the world are born of being;\nbeing is born of non-being.\n\nThe Way generates the One,\nthe One generates the Two,\nthe Two generate the Three,\nthe Three generate the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nblending their qi to attain harmony.\n\nWhat the world despises—\n\"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" \"destitute\"—\nare the very names kings and dukes use for themselves.\nThus things may be diminished yet increased,\nor increased yet diminished.\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n\"The violent do not die a natural death.\"\nI shall take this as the father of my teaching.\n\nThe softest under heaven\ngallops through the hardest under heaven.\nNon-being enters where there is no gap.\nThus I know the benefit of non-action.\nTeaching without words,\nthe benefit of non-action—\nfew under heaven can attain this.\n\nWhich is dearer, fame or life?\nWhich is greater, life or wealth?\nWhich is more harmful, gain or loss?\nExcessive love must lead to great expenditure;\nhoarding much must lead to heavy loss.\nThus, knowing contentment brings no disgrace;\nknowing when to stop brings no danger—\nthis is how to endure long.\n\nGreat perfection seems flawed,\nyet its use is never exhausted.\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nyet its use is never depleted.\nGreat straightness seems bent;\ngreat skill seems clumsy;\ngreat eloquence seems halting.\n\nRestlessness overcomes cold;\nstillness overcomes heat.\nPurity and stillness can set the world right.\n\nWhen the world has the Way,\nwarhorses are retired to fertilize fields.\nWhen the world lacks the Way,\ncavalry mounts are born in the wilds.\nNo sin is greater than desire;\nno calamity is greater than discontent;\nno fault is more grievous than covetousness.\nThus, knowing contentment’s contentment\nis always contentment.\n\nWithout stepping outside, know the world;\nwithout looking out the window, know the heavenly Way.\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\nThus the sage knows without traveling,\nnames without seeing,\naccomplishes without acting.\n\nThose who pursue learning increase day by day;\nthose who hear the Way decrease day by day.\nDecrease and further decrease,\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nTo take the world, one must always be without affairs.\nIf one engages in affairs,\none is not fit to take the world.\n\nThe sage has no fixed mind,\nbut takes the people’s mind as his mind.\nThe good, he treats as good;\nthe not-good, he also treats as good—\nthus attaining goodness.\nThe trustworthy, he trusts;\nthe untrustworthy, he also trusts—\nthus attaining trustworthiness.\nThe sage, in the world,\ncontracts his mind for the world,\nblending his mind with the world.\nThe people all strain their ears and eyes,\nand the sage treats them all as children.\n\nEmerging into life, entering death.\nThose who follow life are thirteen;\nthose who follow death are thirteen;\nyet people, in living their lives,\nall move toward the land of death—thirteen.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they cling to life too tightly.\nI have heard that one who is good at preserving life\nwalks the hills without avoiding rhinos or tigers,\nenters battle without donning armor or weapons.\nThe rhino has nowhere to thrust its horn;\nthe tiger has nowhere to sink its claws;\nweapons have nowhere to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this?\nBecause there is no place of death in him.\n\nThe Way gives them life, and virtue rears them;\nthings shape them, and instruments complete them.\nThus the myriad things honor the Way and value virtue.\nThe honor of the Way, the value of virtue—\nnothing bestows this, yet it is always natural.\nThe Way gives them life, rears them,\nnurtures them, matures them,\nripens them, sustains them,\nprotects them, and returns them.\nGiving life without possessing,\nacting without claiming,\nleading without dominating—\nthis is called profound virtue.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich may be taken as the mother of the world.\nHaving attained the mother,\none may know her children.\nHaving known the children,\nreturn to guard the mother—\nand to the end of life, one will not be imperiled.\nBlock the openings,\nshut the doors—\nand to the end of life, one will not be weary.\nOpen the openings,\nmultiply affairs—\nand to the end of life, one will not

      "translated_text": "Whose limit none can know—this is how one may possess the state.\nPossessing the state’s mother, one may endure long.\nThis is called deep roots and firm foundation,\nthe Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the world is established by the Dao,\nits ghosts do not become spirits.\nNot that its ghosts do not become spirits,\nbut their spirits do not harm people.\nNot that their spirits do not harm people,\nbut the sage also does not harm.\nWhen the two do not harm each other,\nvirtue and power thus converge.\n\nA great state is the lower reaches,\nthe female of the world,\nthe meeting place of the world.\nThe female always overcomes the male through stillness.\nBeing still, she thus fittingly remains below.\nWhen a great state lowers itself to small states, it wins over small states.\nWhen a small state lowers itself to a great state, it wins over the great state.\nThus, some lower themselves to win,\nsome lower themselves and win.\nA great state desires nothing more than to unite and nurture people;\na small state desires nothing more than to enter and serve people.\nWhen both attain their desires,\nthe greater must fittingly remain below.\n\nThe Dao is the wellspring of the ten thousand things.\nIt is the treasure of the good,\nand the refuge of the not-good.\nFine words can be traded in the marketplace;\nnoble conduct can bring honor to others.\nIf people are not good,\nwhy should they be cast aside?\nThus, when establishing the Son of Heaven\nand appointing the Three Ministers,\nthough one may have jade discs preceded by teams of four horses,\nit is better to sit and present this.\n\nWhy was this Dao esteemed by the ancients?\nIs it not because one seeks and obtains,\nand sins are thereby absolved?\nThus, it is honored throughout the world.\n\nPractice non-action, engage in no business,\nsavor the flavorless.\nGreat or small, many or few—repay enmity with virtue.\nResolve difficulty in its ease,\nachieve greatness in its smallness.\nThe world’s difficulties arise from ease;\nthe world’s greatness arises from smallness.\nTherefore, the sage never strives for greatness,\nand thus accomplishes greatness.\n\nIf one is hasty, trust will be scarce;\nif one takes things lightly, difficulties will multiply.\nTherefore, the sage treats difficulty with care,\nand thus never encounters difficulty.\n\nIn its tranquility, it is easy to hold.\nIn its unformed state, it is easy to plan.\nIn its fragility, it is easy to break.\nIn its subtlety, it is easy to scatter.\nAct before it exists;\ngovern before it becomes chaotic.\n\nA tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout.\nA nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth.\nA journey of a hundred *ren* begins beneath one’s feet.\nThose who act will fail;\nthose who grasp will lose.\nThus, the sage practices non-action and does not fail,\nholds nothing and does not lose.\n\nIn their undertakings, people often fail when near completion.\nTherefore, be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nand there will be no failure.\n\nThus, the sage desires what others do not desire\nand does not prize rare goods.\nHe learns what others do not learn,\nreturning to what the multitude has passed by.\nHe can assist the natural course of the ten thousand things\nbut dares not act.\n\nTherefore, it is said:\nThose who follow the Dao do not enlighten the people,\nbut rather keep them simple.\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause of their knowledge.\nThus, governing a state with knowledge\nis the state’s ruin.\nGoverning a state without knowledge\nis the state’s blessing.\nTo constantly know these two principles\nis also a model.\nTo constantly know this model\nis called profound virtue.\nProfound virtue is deep and far-reaching,\nturning back with things to reach great compliance.\n\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys\nis because they excel at staying low.\nThus, they can be kings of all valleys.\nTherefore, when the sage wishes to be above the people,\nhe must speak as though he is below them.\nWhen he wishes to lead the people,\nhe must place himself behind them.\nThus, though he dwells in front, the people do not feel harmed;\nthough he dwells above, the people do not feel burdened.\nThe world delights in following him and does not grow weary.\nIs it not because he does not contend?\nThus, none in the world can contend with him.\n\nA small state with few people,\nthough it has tools for a hundred or a thousand,\ndoes not use them.\nIt makes the people value life and not travel far.\nThough there are boats and carriages, none ride them;\nthough there are armor and weapons, none display them.\nIt makes the people return to knotting cords for use.\nThey find their food sweet,\ntheir clothing beautiful,\ntheir customs joyful,\ntheir dwellings secure.\nNeighboring states are within sight,\nthe sounds of chickens and dogs are within hearing,\nyet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.\n\nThough true words are not beautiful,\nbeautiful words are not true.\nThe wise are not learned;\nthe learned are not wise.\nThe good are not excessive;\nthe excessive are not good.\nThe sage accumulates nothing.\nHaving fully given to others, he has even more;\nhaving fully bestowed upon others, he has even greater abundance.\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm.\nThe Dao of humans acts but does not contend.\n\nThe world all say I am great, great yet not confined.\nIt is precisely because I am great that I am not confined.\nIf I were confined, I would have long since become small.\n\nI always have three treasures to preserve:\nthe first is compassion,\nthe second is frugality,\nthe third is not daring to be first in the world.\nWith compassion, one can be brave.\nWith frugality, one can be expansive.\nNot daring to be first in the world,\none can become the leader of all things.\n\nNow, if one abandons compassion yet seeks bravery,\nabandons humility yet seeks precedence,\none will surely perish.\nCompassion in battle brings victory;\nin defense, it brings firmness.\nHeaven will establish one—\nyou should surround them with compassion.\n\nThe good warrior is not martial;\nthe good fighter is not enraged;\nthe good conqueror does not engage the enemy;\nthe good employer of people remains below them.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthe power of employing people,\nthe ultimate of Heaven’s ancient ways.\n\nThere is a saying in the use of arms:\nI dare not be the host but act as the guest;\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\nThis is called marching without marching,\nraising arms without arms,\nwielding weapons without weapons,\nfacing no enemy.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy;\nunderestimating the enemy risks losing my treasures.\nThus, when evenly matched armies clash,\nthe grieving side will prevail.\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice,\nyet none in the world can know them,\nnone can practice them.\nWords have an origin;\naffairs have a master.\nIt is only through ignorance\nthat I am not known.",

claim knowledge is a flaw.\nThe sage is free from flaws\nbecause he treats his flaw as a flaw—\nthus he is free from flaws.\n\nWhen the people no longer fear what should be feared,\ngreat fear will come.\nDo not restrict their dwelling,\ndo not stifle their livelihood.\nOnly by not stifling them will they not be stifled.\nThus the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nloves himself but does not exalt himself.\nTherefore he discards the one and takes the other.\n\nHe who is brave in daring will be killed;\nhe who is brave in not daring will live.\nOf these two, one brings benefit, the other harm.\nWhat Heaven detests—who knows the reason?\nThe Dao of Heaven\ndoes not contend yet excels in victory,\ndoes not speak yet excels in response,\ndoes not summon yet comes of itself,\nis unhurried yet excels in planning.\nHeaven’s net is vast,\nwide-meshed yet nothing slips through.\n\nIf the people constantly do not fear death,\nhow can they be frightened with death?\nIf the people constantly fear death,\nthen those who act perversely I will seize and kill—\nwho would dare?\nIf the people must always fear death,\nthere is always an executioner.\nTo kill the executioner is like hewing the master carpenter’s wood—\nfew will not wound their own hands.\n\nPeople suffer hunger\nbecause their rulers take too much in taxes—\nthus they suffer hunger.\nThe common people are ungovernable\nbecause their superiors impose too many measures—\nthus they are ungovernable.\nThe people disregard death\nbecause they seek life too fervently—\nthus they disregard death.\nOnly he who does not make life his purpose\nis wiser than one who values life.\n\nIn life, people are supple and weak;\nin death, they are stiff and strong.\nAll things—plants and trees—\nin life are supple and fragile;\nin death, they are withered and dry.\nThus it is said:\nThe stiff and strong are companions of death;\nthe supple, weak, and delicate are companions of life.\nTherefore a strong army will not prevail,\na strong tree will be felled.\nThe great and strong dwell below;\nthe supple, weak, and delicate dwell above.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow:\nthe high is pressed down, the low is lifted up.\nWhat has excess is reduced,\nwhat is deficient is supplemented.\nThus the Dao of Heaven reduces excess and supplements deficiency,\nbut the human way is not so—\nit reduces deficiency to serve excess.\nWho can take from excess to offer to Heaven?\nOnly one who possesses the Dao.\nThus the sage acts but does not possess,\naccomplishes but does not dwell.\nIn this way, he does not wish to display his worth.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the hard and strong—\nnothing can replace it.\nThat the weak overcomes the strong,\nthe soft overcomes the hard—\nnone in the world do not know this,\nyet none can practice it.\nThus the sage’s words say:\nTo bear the state’s disgrace is called master of the altars of soil and grain;\nto bear the state’s misfortune is called king of all under Heaven.\nTrue words seem paradoxical.\n\nTo reconcile great resentment,\nsome resentment will remain—\nhow can this be good?\nThus the sage holds the tally\nbut does not demand from others.\nTherefore the virtuous control the tally,\nthe unvirtuous control the tax.\nThe Dao of Heaven shows no partiality—\nit always sides with the good.\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nThe nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things;\nthe named is the mother of the ten thousand things.\nThus, in constant non-desire,\none observes its mystery;\nin constant desire,\none observes its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together but differ in name.\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and more profound—\nthe gate of all mysteries.\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nugliness arises.\nWhen all know good,\nthen non-good is established.\nThus being and non-being produce each other,\ndifficult and easy complete each other,\nlong and short shape each other,\nhigh and low fill each other,\nnote and voice harmonize with each other,\nbefore and after follow each other—\nthis is constant.\n\nTherefore the sage dwells in non-action,\npractices wordless teaching,\nlets the ten thousand things arise without beginning them,\nacts without claiming,\naccomplishes without dwelling.\nOnly by not dwelling\ndoes it not depart.\n\nDo not exalt the worthy,\nand the people will not contend.\nDo not value rare goods,\nand the people will not steal.\nDo not display what is desirable,\nand the people’s hearts will not be disturbed.\nThus the sage’s governance:\nempties their
