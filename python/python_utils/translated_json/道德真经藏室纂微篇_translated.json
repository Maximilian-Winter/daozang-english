  "full_translation": "**Daoist Classic *Zhenjing Cangshu Zuanwei* (Selections from the Treasury of the Daoist *Zhenjing*)\nChapter Title: *Zhenjing Cangshu Mùwéi* (Selections from the Treasury of the Daoist *Zhenjing* on Reverence for the Subtle)\nCompiled by **Bìxū Zǐ Chén Jǐngyuán** of the **Song** dynasty. Ten volumes.\n\nAccording to **Yáng Zhònggēng’s preface**, this work was published in the year **Bǎobǎo 6** of the **Dàodé Zhōng** school (1258 CE). The original source is the *Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), under the *Dòngshén* (Cavernous Deities) section, in the **Jùjié** (Jade Precepts) category.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One**\nCompiled by **Bìxū Zǐ Chén Jǐngyuán**\n\n**Daoist Scripture (Upper Section)**\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is expounded in terms of **Chángdào** (the Eternal Dao). The **Chángdào** is the **void-hearted** (emptiness of the mind) that awaits all things.\n\nThe Dao, when it can be spoken of, is **not** the **Chángdào**. The Dao that can be articulated is subject to change, to transmigration, to speech and explanation—this is called **teachings and precepts**. How is it different from dross? Let us examine it by elucidating:\n\nThe Dao is **the Way of universal passage** (通). All things obtain it, and thus nothing is impassable.\nIt is also called **the Way of traversal** (蹈), taking the path as its metaphor.\nThe *Shuōwén* (Explanations of Script and Characters) states: **\"One path reaching through is called Dao.\"** The ancient sages commanded that it be embodied and practiced, hence it is called **Dao**.\n\nAs for **virtue/power** (德) such as *rén* (benevolence), *yì* (righteousness), *lǐ* (propriety), *zhì* (wisdom), and *xìn* (faithfulness), these are all **applications of the Dao**. When applied, it is called **the Dao that can be spoken of**.\n\nOnce the **Dao that can be spoken of** is made manifest, it is **no longer the Chángdào**. The **Chángdào** is the spontaneous and natural, responding to sensation and transforming without end. It cannot be transmitted by words, nor can it be sought by intellect—only by embodying and merging with the **transformative power** (造化), containing the luminous light and hiding its radiance, acting without action yet accomplishing all things, silently attaining its utmost.\n\n**Yán Jùnpíng** (严君平) said: The **Dao that can be spoken of** is the **Dao of virtue/power** made manifest, yet it is **not** the natural Dao.\n\nThose who practice today do not carry torches by day, for the sun is bright. The sun’s brightness is the **Dao that is not spoken of**, eternal in its constancy. Carrying torches is the **Dao that can be spoken of**, made manifest.\n\nWhat is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and can be passed on to others—this is the **Dao that can be spoken of**. If it can be passed on yet cannot be received, if it can be obtained yet not seen, if it is the **self-originating root** (自本自根), before Heaven and Earth existed, since ancient times yet eternally preserved—then the **Dao of the Cavernous Deities** (神鬼、神帝), the **Dao that generates Heaven and Earth**, is the **Chángdào**.\n\nThe **five-thousand-word essence** (五千文) is unfolded from these few words, truly the **mysterious within the mysterious**, the **divine within the divine**.\n\n**Naming and the Dao/Way**:\nThe Dao, when it can be named, is **not** the **Chángdào**.\nThe Dao is **embodiment** (体). Naming is **application** (用). Application arises from embodiment, and naming comes from the Dao. Once its name is marked, it can be applied. The application being established, it is called **the Dao that can be named**.\n\nOnce the **Dao that can be named** is applied, it is **no longer the Chángdào**. The **Chángdào** is the **name of application without bounds**, fragmenting its virtue/power.\n\n**Yán Jùnpíng** said: The **Dao that can be named** is the **Dao of virtue/power** made manifest, yet it is **not** the innate truth.\n\n**Lì Zǐ** (列子) dwelled in the **Jìng** (郑) garden for forty years, and no one recognized him. The king and ministers treated him like the common folk—this is truly the **Dao of guarding the Chángdào**.\n\nThe **beginning of Heaven and Earth** is **nameless** (无名). The **nameless** refers to the Dao. Before all transformations, there was no way to force a name upon it. When the **marvelous origin** (妙本) first descended, the **primordial simplicity** (浑沦之朴) was about to depart, and then the **Great Polarity** (太极) of the *Yì* (易) emerged, giving rise to the **Two Principles** (两仪).\n\n**Yán Jùnpíng** said: The **nameless** is **without traces** (无朕), merging with the divine embodiment, the world relying upon it yet unaware of its transformation from **voidness** (虚无), making it the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**—this is the **embodiment of the Dao**.\n\nThe **named** (有名) is the **mother of all things**. The **named** refers to **Heaven and Earth**. Heaven’s bestowal and Earth’s transformation nurture all things. They shelter and harm them like a mother nurturing her children. Hence it is called the **named**, the **mother of all things**.\n\nThe **Great Dao** is mysterious and remote—how could it be confined to the **named** or the **nameless**? The sage **simplifies application to establish teachings**, thereby clarifying the **similarities and differences** of the **origin and traces**.\n\nAll **Dao that is renewed daily** is said to be **nameless**. Hence, the **beginning of all things** is the **nameless**. The **completion of all things** is the **named**.\n\n**Yán Jùnpíng** said: The **named** is the **Dao of transformation**. Revering the Dao and valuing the divine, following the **Great Harmony** (太和), then Heaven and Earth become the **mother of all things**—this is the **application of the Dao**.\n\n**Always without desire**, one may observe its **mystery** (妙);\n**Always with desire**, one may observe its **boundaries** (徼).\n\n**Desire** (欲) is the **pursuit of sensory realms** that generates the mind.\n**Mystery** (妙) is the **essence of the utmost subtlety**.\n**Boundary** (徼) is the **edge and corner**.\n\nThe **Great Dao** has small paths at its boundaries—these are called **boundaries**. It is also **return**.\nThe **Dao of voidness** (虚无) is **still and unmoving**—this is called **without desire**.\nWhen it **senses and gives birth to all things**, it is called **with desire**.\n**Without desire** is observing the **mystery** while guarding the **voidness**.\n**With desire** is observing the **boundaries**—this is called **retaining thought** (存思).\n\nIt has been said that **true constancy** (真常) is the **Great Dao** itself.\n**Without desire** and **with desire** are the **Dao’s applications**.\nThe Dao originally has **no form**—**form** arises when the Dao is sensed and generated.\nWhat is **above form** is called the Dao.\nWhat is **below form** is called **instrumentality** (器).\n\nThe **superior person** (上士) knows the **subtle** and the **manifest**, seeing what is **not yet formed** and already exhausting its **mystery**—hence, **always without desire**, they observe its **mystery**.\nThe **middle person** (中士) follows and adapts to things, seeing their **clusters and masses** (群村), and thus obtains their **application**—hence, though there are **ten thousand differences**, the **true principle** (真理) is unfathomable, but they merely **glimpse its boundaries**.\n\nAnother elucidation states:\nIf a person **always embodies the subtle essence of the Great Dao**, guards the **key to stillness** (清静之要), and returns to the **extreme of life and vitality** (性命之极), not being seduced by external things, then their **intentions and will** (志意) become **pure and vast** (虚澹), able to observe the **Dao’s utmost mystery** and the **Dao’s ultimate boundaries**.\n\n**Yán Jùnpíng** said:\nWhen the **mind is like metal or stone** (金石), the **body is like the wood of the *jú* tree** (桔木), and one **silently dwells in the corners** (隅隅), with **intentions as gentle as a colt** (驹犊)—this is the **person without desire**, returning to the **root of life and vitality**.\n\nThe person with desire consumes the boundaries of things and loses the path of ease and openness.\nThey see only the petty edges of the net, lost and unable to return, forfeiting the true origin.\n\nSome ancient sages said that those without desire embody the Dao inwardly, observing transformation without attachment to any form or trace, forgetting their own origins.\n\nThose with desire, however, arise from the root and apply its use to what can be spoken of—establishing teachings to respond to things, accomplishing the salvation of myriad affairs. They perceive the end of things and know their return, first speaking of restraining oneself, then of transforming the people. Cultivating oneself and governing the state—these two are the same.\n\nIn principle, nothing is lacking. These two are the same—what can be spoken of and what can be named, the unnamed and the named, desirelessness and desire. All are contained within the still, motionless, and profound source, where essence and function remain indistinct, and good and evil are both extinguished. Hence, they are said to be the same.\n\nYet when they manifest, they take on different names. By \"manifest,\" it means descending from the root to expound what can be spoken of in gradual stages. Though originating from one mind, the applications of the Five Constants differ, and the wise and foolish vary and transform. Lifespans, fortune, and existence all differ—each takes on its own name.\n\nThe same is called the Mysterious. The Mysterious again, the Mysterious—this is profound and subtle, obscure and natural. What is called \"natural\" is the Way.\n\nIt is said that both the unnamed and the named, desirelessness and desire, all receive *qi* from Heaven and examine nature’s essence. Pure and impure, honored and humiliated, forms take on myriad shapes—this arises from the Mysterious again, the Mysterious, the Divine again, the Divine. This is what is called \"naturally so.\"\n\nIf one penetrates and comprehends this profound subtlety, piercing the silent and obscure, this is called possessing *Xuándé* (玄德). It is the gateway to all marvels—meaning the realm of the Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and unbounded, with no barriers or confines, no doors or walls—it is boundless and resplendent. When speaking of self-cultivation, outwardly it aligns with the common people, inwardly it becomes the wondrous root. When teaching, the myriad truths emerge from subtlety, and the sages contain subtlety within. Transformation and guidance have no fixed method; profound and singular, it stands alone and unchanging—this is called *Zhīcháng* (知常).\n\nSince there are ways of emergence and return, it is called the *Gate*. Zhuangzi said:\n*\"There is birth and there is death,\nThere is exit and there is entry.\nExit and entry without seeing its form—\nThis is called the Heavenly Gate.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Gate is the state of *wu* (無有, non-being).\nAll things emerge from non-being—\nThis is also called the gateway to all marvels.\n\nOnly the Marvelous Dao gives rise to all things.\nWhat gives rise to all things is surely the Marvelous Dao.\nThose who use the Dao are surely the sages.\nThe sage’s Dao renews itself daily, its applications boundless—\nHence, it is called *Cháng* (常, the Constant).\n\nEmergence and retreat have boundaries;\nDesire for difference leads to action—\nHence, it is called *kě* (可, permissible).\n\nWhat can be spoken of must be named;\nWhat is named must be known—\nHence, it follows with *\"All under Heaven know.\"*\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThen ugliness already exists.\nAll know goodness as goodness—\nThen ungoodness already exists.\n\nBeauty and goodness arise from deluded emotions.\nWhat one’s emotions favor becomes beauty;\nWhat one’s emotions reject becomes ugliness.\nIf one indulges deluded emotions, what is not ugliness?\n\nWhat one takes as right becomes goodness;\nWhat one takes as wrong becomes ungoodness.\nIf one indulges in one’s own right and wrong,\nHow can there be true beauty?\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Is and is-not—this is what I call emotions.\nWhat I call without-emotion is:\nPeople do not harm themselves with their likes and dislikes,\nAlways following nature without artificial enhancement.\nThis is called stopping at what is truly fitting.\"*\n\nThe sage is not without beauty and goodness—\nRather, they possess it without boasting,\nThus aligning with non-being.\nNot boasting preserves virtue intact;\nAligning with non-being keeps harm at bay.\nVirtue preserved, harm distant—\nThen beauty and goodness are complete.\n\nIf one uses beauty and goodness to transform the world,\nMaking them know beauty as beauty—\nThis is not yet perfect goodness.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The highest virtue does not cling to virtue;\nThe lower virtue does not lose virtue.\"*\nThis is correct.\n\nMoreover, good people are few under Heaven,\nWhile ungood people are many.\nIf one corrects their governance and secretly mocks them,\nThis becomes evil.\n\nYán Jùnpíng said:\n*\"The bright does not always endure;\nThe obscure does not always vanish.\nHonor and decay begin in late spring,\nWild plants and grains sprout at the autumn equinox.\nOn the winter solstice, all things flourish;\nOn the summer solstice, all things wither.\nIt is said that prosperity must yield to decline,\nAnd beauty must yield to ugliness.\nEven yin and yang follow this—\nHow much more so for humans?\"*\n\nThis is a warning against those who boast in beauty and goodness.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLength and shortness define each other,\nHigh and low incline against each other,\nSounds harmonize with each other,\nFront and back follow each other.\n\nThese six principles, when one boasts in beauty and goodness, lead to action.\nOnce action is manifest, partial fixation arises,\nAnd mutual destruction and harm emerge—\nThings lose their nature.\nHence, it concludes with the sage’s *wuwei*,\nAnd *Xuándé* does not depart.\n\nThe nature of being and non-being\nOriginally does not give rise to each other.\nYet it is said that being must emerge from non-being,\nAnd non-being must arise from being—\nHence, *\"being and non-being give rise to each other.\"*\n\nThe principle of difficulty and ease\nOriginally does not complete each other.\nFor instance, the potter finds clay easy to shape\nBut wood difficult to work.\nThe carpenter finds wood easy to shape\nBut altars difficult to construct.\nIf one tries to make the easy difficult,\nIt will not succeed.\nIf each sticks to their craft,\nIt will be accomplished—\nHence, *\"difficulty and ease complete each other.\"*\n\nLength and shortness\nOriginally do not define each other.\nSeeing a crane, one knows the hare’s legs are short;\nObserving a hare, one knows the crane’s legs are long.\nThings follow this pattern—\nHence, *\"length and shortness define each other.\"*\n\nHigh and low\nOriginally do not incline against each other.\nIf one lacks sufficient rank,\nThen the desire for usurpation arises.\nIf one is high but not arrogant,\nThen none will seek to humble them.\nIf one is low but not abased,\nThen none will seek to exalt them.\nIf one aspires and envies, striving to surpass others,\nThen all will topple each other—\nHence, *\"high and low incline against each other.\"*\n\nThe resonance of sounds,\nOriginally does not harmonize.\nLike the natural music of heaven,\nIt hums and ceases on its own.\nYet the world claims that tones and rhythms,\nQi and melodies combine to form songs,\nTo harmonize and hum together—\nHence, *\"sounds harmonize.\"*\n\nBefore and after,\nOriginally do not follow in sequence.\nLike day and night succeeding each other,\nYesterday is before today,\nToday is after yesterday.\nAgain, like the path of forward and backward steps—\nLifting the foot, lowering the foot,\nWhich comes first, which comes after?\nIt shifts and changes.\nJun Ping said:\nWithout the void, there is no way to perceive existence;\nWith the void, form takes shape.\nDifficulty cannot reveal ease,\nEase cannot reveal difficulty.\nAn inch shortens a foot,\nA foot lengthens an inch.\nMountains collapse through valleys,\nValleys tilt through mountains.\nSounds distinguish tones,\nTones pause through sounds.\nWhat comes first is seen through what follows,\nWhat follows is understood through what precedes.\nThus, without the void, existence cannot be seen;\nWithout existence, the void cannot be known.\nWithout difficulty, ease cannot be known;\nWithout ease, difficulty cannot be known.\nWithout length, shortness cannot be known;\nWithout shortness, length cannot be known.\nWithout mountains, valleys cannot be known;\nWithout valleys, mountains cannot be known.\nWithout sounds, tones cannot be known;\nWithout tones, sounds cannot be known.\nWithout what comes first, what follows cannot be known;\nWithout what follows, what comes first cannot be known.\n\nAll these things—\nThe proofs of Heaven and Earth,\nThe symbols of Nature—\nAre laid out, exposed, and slow to change.\nAffirmation and negation follow each other,\nBeginning and end reverse and repeat,\nUnseparable, beyond evasion by the numinous,\nUnopposed by yin and yang.\n\nFrom this, it is seen:\nThe affairs of the Sage-King\nCannot be achieved through contrived action.\n\nThus, the Sage acts in *wuwei*,\nPractices the teaching of *non-speech*.\nThis speaks of the ancient Sage-Kings,\nWho did not govern the world through beauty and virtue,\nYet the world governed itself.\n*Wuwei* is not idle inaction or silent withdrawal—\nIt is the forgetting of beauty and virtue,\nThe annihilation of emotion, the return to true nature,\nWhere the people act according to their abilities,\nThings settle into their proper order,\nAnd none disturb the harmony above or below.\nThus, the teaching of *non-speech* is carried out—\nBy leading with one’s own conduct,\nRectifying one’s bearing to enlighten things,\nActing in accordance with the times,\nUtilizing resources to achieve merit,\nAnd aligning with the principle of *forgetting speech*.\n\nAll things act without complaint.\n*Action* is movement.\nThe Sage governs the world with *youshou* (nurturing),\nDoing nothing, yet nothing is undone—\nThus the people till and eat,\nWeave and clothe themselves,\nRest content in their homes,\nAnd play with full bellies.\nThey take joy in their natural inclinations,\nAll drinking from the transformation of *wuwei*.\nThus the Sage entrusts them without complaint.\nThe people can be led along a path,\nBut cannot be made to know its purpose.\nThis is the wind of *upper virtue not claiming virtue*.\n\nTo give birth without possession,\nTo act without reliance,\nTo complete deeds without taking credit—\nAll things arise and transform on their own,\nStanding alone and self-so,\nNot claimed as one’s own.\nAll creatures pursue their nature,\nEach adapting to its kind,\nNot relying on their own virtue.\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,\nThe Way permeates all things,\nThe mind wanders in the Maoshu Mountains,\nNot lording over the people.\nThis is the complete virtue of the Sage.\n\nOnly by not claiming\nDoes one not depart.\nThe Sage’s deeds are like those of Creation,\nAllowing all things to reach their utmost,\nForgetting name and self.\nNot claiming means not taking position as one’s own,\nThus the people are unaware, unknowing—\nHence, their Way does not perish,\nTheir virtue does not fade.\n\n*The Honglie Explanation* says:\nWhen the Chu did not appoint Zi Fa to attack Cai,\nHe was praised, and King Xuan of Chu welcomed him at the border,\nGranting him a hundred *mu* of land and sealing him with a jade tablet.\nZi Fa declined, saying:\n*\"To govern a state and establish policies,\nTo receive vassal lords as guests—\nThis is the virtue of the ruler.\nTo issue commands and the enemy flees before battle—\nThis is the might of the general.\nTo array the troops and defeat the enemy—\nThis is the strength of the common people.\nTo ride upon the people’s labor and take their rank and rewards—\nThis is not the Way of ren and yi.*\nThus he declined and did not accept it.\nThis is *completing deeds without claiming them.*\"\n\nKnowledge brings the mutual birth of good and evil,\nThe incline of high and low cannot be escaped.\nDifficulty and ease stand opposed,\nThe talents of long and short cannot be concealed.\nWhen long and short are revealed, the worthy are praised—\nHence, it is followed by *not praising the worthy*.\nNot praising the worthy prevents the people from contending.\nIf the ruler is humble, yielding, and tranquil,\nNot boasting of his own virtue,\nThen the people’s transformation follows like wind bending grass,\nAnd who would dare to contend?\n*The Classic* says:\n*\"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people rectify themselves.\"*\n\nAnother explanation says:\nIf the ruler is tranquil,\nThe ministers are enlightened,\nPunishments do not spare the noble,\nGrace does not exclude the lowly,\nThe worthy and unworthy each fulfill their roles—\nThen the scholars will not contend.\nBut if the ruler is indecisive,\nThe ministers are flattering,\nThough they praise the worthy and seek talent,\nTheir outward loyalty hides inner deceit,\nAnd those with poisonous hearts and harmonious words arrive—\nThen deceit arises and contention spreads.\n\nJun Ping said:\nThe Sage is the master of great virtue,\nThe commoner is the servant of lesser virtue.\nThe worthy are not one in ten thousand,\nThe Sage does not appear in every age.\nHeaven’s creation of the worthy and unworthy\nIs not by praising them.\n\nAgain, it is said:\nLike driving a poor horse and a fine steed together on a level road,\nOr letting a wild goose and a quail fly side by side in the blue sky—\nThen the worthy and unworthy become clear.\nThis is natural, not by praising them.\n\nNot valuing rare treasures\nPrevents the people from stealing.\nRare treasures are gold, jade, pearls, and rhinoceros horn.\nIf the ruler’s transformation is pure and tranquil,\nThe people focus on farming and learning,\nHiding gold in the mountains,\nDiscarding pearls in the depths,\nFinding no profit in wealth,\nNo attraction in nobility—\nThen the people will have no heart for theft.\nAnother explanation says:\nThe black dragon’s night-light pearls,\nGold, jade, brocade, and embroidery—\nIf the ruler does not value them,\nThe people will not covet them,\nAnd where would thieves come from?\nThe saying goes:\n*\"If a person does not desire it,\nEven if rewarded, they will not steal.\"*\n\n*The Honglie Explanation* says:\nCiting the laws of Shennong:\n*\"If a man is strong yet does not plow,\nThere will be those who starve in the world.\"*\n\nWhen women reach adulthood yet remain uneducated,\nThe world will have those who suffer from cold.\n\nThus, the ruler himself plows,\nHis wife weaves,\nSetting an example for all under heaven.\nThis is how he guides the people—\nBy not valuing rare treasures,\nBy making desirable things unseen,\nSo that the people’s hearts remain undisturbed.\n\nDesirable things are those external objects\nThat bewilder the mind,\nGiving rise to covetous and lustful desires.\nYet \"not seeing\" does not mean distant isolation—\nIt means not letting perception become perception,\nBut embracing *wuwei* instead.\n\nIf the ruler beholds external things\nYet harbors no covetous or lustful desires,\nThen he is untouched by the defilements of form,\nAnd his original nature returns to purity and tranquility—\nTo its true, singular essence.\n\nWhen the ruler preserves this true singularity,\nThe people’s hearts remain undisturbed,\nAnd the winds of simplicity and sincerity can flourish.\n\n**Jun Ping** says:\nIf the world does not honor the worthy,\nThe people will not strive,\nAnd without striving, there will be no contention,\nAnd without contention, there will be no disorder.\nIf the world does not value wealth,\nThe people will not desire it,\nAnd without desire, there will be no seeking,\nAnd without seeking, there will be no theft.\nIf the world abandons the pleasures of music and dance,\nThe people will have no joy,\nAnd without joy, there will be no licentiousness.\nThis is the natural order of things.\n\n*The Honglie Explanation* says:\n**Ordering Yin Zi Pei** to drink with King Zhuang of Chu,\nThe king agreed.\nZi Pei stood with loose sleeves, facing north in the hall,\nThinking: *\"The king once granted this, yet now does not fulfill it—\nPerhaps I have erred?\"*\n\nThe king replied:\n*\"I have heard of your Strong Terrace.\nThat terrace overlooks the Liang Mountains,\nFacing the vast expanse,\nWith the river to its left and the Huai to its right—\nIts pleasures make one forget life and death.\nA man of my meager virtue cannot bear such delights.\nI fear if I linger, I may never return.\nThus, the saying: 'Make desirable things unseen,\nSo that the heart remains undisturbed.'\"*\n\n**Transmission of Yi’s *Yin Yi*** says:\nThe ancient text reads *\"make the people’s hearts undisturbed,\"*\nBut the He Shang Gong *Kaoyuan* edition reads *\"make the heart undisturbed,\"*\nWhich is also acceptable.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance begins with emptying the heart—\nFirst purifying oneself,\nThen extending to family and state.\nEmptying the heart means harboring no wicked thoughts.\nNot forcing the mind to chase after darkness,\nYet inwardly quelling desires,\nDispelling all attachments,\nSo that the mind naturally settles—\nThis is emptiness.\n\nAs Zhuangzi says:\n*\"In an empty chamber, white purity arises—\nA blessing of stillness.\nStillness means the heart is empty,\nAnd pristine whiteness brings fortune to dwell.\"*\n\n**Filling the belly.**\nThe Sage’s virtue and power internally suffuse,\nThe five spirits remain tranquil,\nContentment is self-sufficient,\nAnd no attachment to wealth or love arises—\nThus, *\"filling the belly.\"*\n\n**Weakening the will.**\nThe will is the mind’s affair.\nWhat the mind pursues is called will.\nTo act with the mind,\nOne must uphold humility, stillness, gentleness, and weakness—\nThen the Dao is complete.\n\n**Strengthening the bones.**\nBones are the body’s framework.\nWhen purity and harmony are sufficient,\nThe body is nourished,\nAnd when vital essence is robust,\nThe bones grow strong—\nThis too is natural law.\n\n**Always keeping the people in ignorance and desirelessness.**\nThe Sage constantly cultivates himself, emptying his heart,\nSo that the people may return to simplicity and sincerity,\nAnd transform naturally with joy.\n\nThe saying goes:\n*\"If one rectifies himself,\nWhat need has he for governance?\"*\nThus, even those who possess knowledge or cunning,\nOr who adorn themselves with deceit,\nAre already influenced by the winds of purity and sincerity,\nTheir hearts grow dull,\nTheir bodies wither—\nThey dare not stir,\nAnd all desires for action fade.\n\n**To act with *wuwei* is to govern perfectly.**\nTo act with *wuwei* means to follow the Way of non-action.\nNon-action means not exceeding one’s natural endowment.\nIf one does not exceed nature,\nThen natural order is preserved,\nAnd all actions become non-action.\n\nWhen all things act without contrivance,\nThe hearts of covetousness and seeking vanish entirely,\nAnd the winds of simplicity prevail—\nWho could say governance fails?\n\nTo honor one’s own worth and ability makes the people follow,\nBut to indulge in contention and theft stirs the desires that breed chaos.\nOnly the Sage governs through emptiness and openness,\nThus he follows with the *chong* of the Dao.\n\nThe *chong* of the Dao,\nWhen applied, is never full.\n*\"Full\"* in the ancient text means *\"satisfied.\"*\n*Chong* means emptiness.\nIt also means centrality—\nAn indefinite term,\nAnd also constancy.\nThe Dao’s use lies in its emptiness—\nHarmonious *qi* is empty and open,\nThus it flows universally.\nThe ruler who attains this emptiness\nLoses his wealth in a thousand chariots,\nWhile the common man, attaining it,\nForgets his poverty in a single room.\nThough seated in the temple halls,\nHis heart is as still as in a mountain cave;\nThough dressed in coarse rags,\nHe does not differ from the adorned in fine silks—\nThis is the profound attainment of emptiness,\nAnd the absence of fullness.\n\n**Jun Ping** says:\nThose who *do* emptiness are not empty,\nThose who *do* harmony are not harmonious.\nOnly by *not* doing emptiness and harmony\nDoes one truly attain emptiness and harmony.\nEmptiness takes emptiness as its dwelling,\nHarmony takes non-action as its home.\nTo be able to empty and to be non-action—\nThis is the excess of emptiness,\nTo be able to be non-action and to empty—\nThis is the constancy of harmony.\nThus, one truly attains the Great Dao,\nThe use of emptiness and harmony without fullness.\n\nThe central way lies in harmony.\nSome dare not establish it—\nThis refers to the Dao itself.\n\nDeep, like the source of all things.\n*Deep* means profound stillness.\n*Fu* is the rhythmic intonation of Daoist chant.\nUnderstanding this,\nThe Dao of emptiness is neither deficient nor excessive,\nIts nature is concentrated and serene—\nDeep, unfathomable—\nThus it is called *deep*.\n\nThe logic of the unfathomable\nIs neither being nor non-being,\nDifficult to name,\nThus it is spoken of metaphorically.\nDaily life flows naturally,\nLike water in a vessel—\nSerene and profound,\nEncompassing all phenomena,\nPreserving both good and evil,\nNurturing all movement and growth—\nThus it is the source of all things.\n\n**Dulling the sharp, unraveling the tangled.**\n*Dulling* means restraining.\nIt also means breaking the edge—\n*Sharp* refers to keen ambition,\nAnd also to forward momentum.\n*Unraveling* means dispersing,\n*Tangled* means excessive agitation.\nThose who advance eagerly for fame and gain\nShould reflect on the Dao’s emptiness,\nRestrain their greed and delusion,\nAnd not exalt themselves.\n\n「Yet some rage with arrogance, galloping in pursuit of fame,\nTheir inner and outer selves in turmoil—\nBut those who grasp the Dao’s profound stillness\nCan loosen bonds and disperse agitation,\nSerene and clear, restoring their true nature.\n*Agitation* (纷), Master He Shang of the Riverbank, renders as *resentment* (忿), meaning \"a knot of grudges.\"\nWhen one harbors resentment and hatred, bound like iron chains,\nYet holds the Dao’s emptiness and harmony in mind,\nAll dissolves—like ice melting in the sun.\n\n*Harmonizing its light*, *blending with the dust*—\nSerene, yet as if something remains.\nThe Dao of ultimate emptiness\nEmploys harmony and balance in its operations,\nAnd its applications know no limits.\n\nIn light, it harmonizes—\nPresent yet without distinction.\nIn dust, it blends—\nCoexisting yet without separation.\n\nWhen responding to phenomena, it merges with light and dust,\nWhen returning to its root, it remains untouched and serene—\nTrace its wondrous origin, and it vanishes into emptiness,\nYet its actions are manifest and real—\nThus it is said: Serene, yet as if something remains.\n\nI do not know whose child I am,\nYet I precede the likeness of the Emperor.\n*I* refers to the Old Master’s self-designation.\n*Likeness* means resemblance.\nI observe the Dao’s unfathomable depths,\nIts boundless, unmeasurable operations,\nCrafting all things.\n\nThe Dao endures through ages past and present,\nHaving neither ancestor nor master—\nWho dares claim descent or lineage?\nIt seems as though, through profound contemplation,\nOne might suppose I emerged before the Celestial Emperor.\n\nIf one employs the Dao’s emptiness and balance,\nThen the *deep* (渊) is never full,\nAnd blending with light and dust,\nThus it becomes the source of all things.\n\nSeeking its source, it precedes Heaven and Earth—\nHence the mention of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not kind,\nYet they treat all things as fodder for sacrifice.\nThe Sage is not kind,\nYet he treats the people as fodder for sacrifice.\n*Fodder* (刍) means grass—\nBound into bundles for ritual offerings.\nIn ancient times, it was used for sacrifices to avert misfortune,\nThen discarded afterward.\nWhen used, they did not cherish it greatly,\nAnd when abandoned, they did not grieve its loss.\nThus, fodder for sacrifice arises from divine purpose,\nYet the divine has no need for the fodder.\nNo need means no partiality,\nNo partiality means no favoritism—\nHence, Heaven and Earth have no favoritism,\nYet great benevolence arises,\nThe Sage is not kind,\nYet Heaven’s kindness is fulfilled.\n\n*Not kind* means lacking emotional attachment to benevolence,\nNot neglecting what is evil.\nThus, Heaven and Earth, lacking sentiment,\nView all things as fodder for sacrifice,\nDemanding no gratitude in return.\nThe Sage, lacking sentiment,\nViews the people as fodder for sacrifice,\nDemanding no gratitude in return.\nThis is the natural way of Heaven and Earth.\n\nMaster Rong Ping said:\nHeaven is high and clear, Earth is thick and yielding—\nThe interplay of Yin and Yang,\nBalanced *qi* flowing,\nNaturally effortless, yet all things arise.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not strain their hearts or minds,\nNor exhaust their spirits in laborious deeds,\nNor weep in excessive affection,\nNor bestow favors with calculated gain,\nNor shower blessings to demand repayment—\nYet all things are nurtured and fulfilled.\nThis is what is meant by:\nHeaven and Earth are not kind,\nYet they treat all things as fodder for sacrifice.\n\nEnlightened kings and sagely rulers\nHold the Dao’s unity and harmony,\nTheir clarity and stillness unchanging,\nYet they adapt in all transformations—\nDivine and effortless,\nTheir actions aligned with the Dao,\nThe world responds, all things naturally evolve.\n\nThe Sage does not exhaust his wisdom or abilities,\nNor disturb his heart with restless schemes,\nNor drain his vital essence in ceaseless toil,\nNor fixate on endless calculations,\nNor flaunt his benevolence in public displays,\nNor lead the people with contrived affection—\nYet virtue spreads universally,\nAnd the realm unites in peace,\nHis kindness reaches to all corners,\nHis deeds are fully accomplished—\nFor what is the art of benevolence and kindness?\n\nThings rely on their allotted measure for transformation,\nYet the Dao’s boundless operations\nGrant measure to the boundless,\nEndowing it with inexhaustible power—\nIf they do not sustain each other,\nIt is like a river drying up,\nAnd the land withering in its wake.\n*Again it is said:*\nEven lice stirring on the hair\nCause sleep to be unsettled.\nMosquitoes settling on the skin\nDistract the mind,\nAnd obstruct clear thought.\nExternal harm from venomous insects\nPierces the heart with pain,\nYet the damage ends at the ears and eyes,\nAnd all limbs grow sluggish.\nThis shows that affection and gain\nStored in the chest\nCannot but bring strain, imbalance, and depletion of vital *qi*.\n\nExcessive words lead to exhaustion,\nBetter to uphold the Center.\n*Excessive words* refers to excessive talk of universal love—\nToo much leads to difficulty in execution,\nThus, words run dry, bending under strain,\nYet if one follows Heaven and Earth’s emptiness and stillness,\nAnd the *bell bellows* (橐钥)’s heartless nature,\nEmbracing the Center’s harmony,\nAll will naturally suffice.\nIt is also the teaching of *non-action* (不言之教).\n\nThe *Honglie Explanation* (《鸿烈解》) says:\nMaster Wang Shou carried his books while walking,\nAnd encountered Xu Feng in Zhou.\nXu Feng said:\n*Action* (事) arises from responding to change,\nChange comes from the times,\nThus, those who know the times act without fixed patterns.\n*Books* are the source of words.\nWords come from those who know,\nAnd those who know hide their books.\nThus, Master Wang Shou burned his books\nAnd danced, saying:\nExcessive words lead to exhaustion,\nBetter to uphold the Center.\n\nHeaven and Earth move and rest without partiality,\nTheir essence containing emptiness yet unyielding—\nThis is due to their *spirit* (神).\nHence, it follows with *the spirit of the valley* (谷神).\n\nThe *spirit of the valley* does not die,\nThis is called the *mysterious female* (玄牝).\nThe Great Person regards the *Great Emptiness* (太虚) as the *valley’s spirit*,\nAnd *creation* (造化) as the *ultimate spirit* (至神).\nThe *valley’s spirit* and *ultimate spirit*\nAre the Dao’s essence and function—\nHow could they ever die?\n\n「The principle of non-death is both profoundly obscure and capable of nurturing as a mother.\nSome liken the *valley* to Heaven and Earth,\nAnd *spirit* to the Great Dao.\nNow, those who speak use the analogy of mountain valleys echoing in response—\nIs this not a small comparison?\n\nMoreover, if a person can embrace openness without limits,\nConform to the boundless scope of the Great Emptiness,\nPreserve the true and genuine *spirit*,\nAnd draw upon the vitality of *creation*,\nThen naturally their form aligns with the Dao—\nWhat is there of death to speak of?\nThus, in obscurity, they flourish and nurture,\nAnd all things receive their blessing—\nThis is called the *mysterious female*.\n\nRiver Above Master’s *Commentary* states:\nThe sound of the *valley* (谷) is *nurturing* (育).\nThe *mysterious female* is nurturance itself.\nIf a person can nurture their *spirit*, they will not die.\nBy *spirit*, they mean the *spirits* of the five *viscera* (五藏):\nThe liver harbors the *hun* (魂),\nThe lungs harbor the *po* (魄),\nThe heart harbors the *spirit* (神),\nThe kidneys harbor the *jing* (精),\nThe spleen harbors the *zhi* (志).\nIf a person can maintain purity, stillness, and emptiness,\nTo nurture their *spirit* without being stained by desires,\nAnd keep their form intact and *spirit* complete—\nThen they will not die.\nIf, however, they indulge in emotions and become entangled,\nDisturbed by all phenomena,\nTheir form becomes impaired and their *spirit* departs—\nHow could the Dao persist?\n\nThe *gateway* of the *mysterious female*\nIs called the *root of Heaven and Earth*.\nFor all things emerge and return through the Great Emptiness and *creation*.\nSince there is the name of *emergence and return*,\nIt is thus called the *gateway*.\nBy *root*, they mean *origin*.\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast,\nThey cannot evade having form—\nAll things of form rely on the Great Emptiness and harmony as their origin,\nHence, it is called the *root of Heaven and Earth*.\nRiver Above Master says:\nThe way to non-death lies within the *mysterious female*.\n*Xuan* (玄) is Heaven,\nIn humans, it is the *nose*.\n*Pin* (牝) is Earth,\nIn humans, it is the *mouth*.\nHeaven nourishes humans with the five *qi* (五气),\nEntering through the nose and stored in the heart—\nThese five *qi*, pure and refined, become the *spirit* of intelligence,\nThe clarity of hearing and voice,\nAnd the five *natures* (性),\nTheir *ghostly* aspect being the *hun*.\nThe *hun* is masculine.\nIt governs the entering and exiting of *qi* through the nose,\nConnecting with Heaven—\nThus, the nose is called *xuan*.\nEarth nourishes humans with the five *flavors* (五味),\nEntering through the mouth and stored in the stomach—\nThese five flavors, coarse and impure, become the *form* of bones, flesh, and blood,\nThe six *emotions* (情),\nTheir *ghostly* aspect being the *po*.\nThe *po* is feminine.\nIt governs the entering and exiting of *qi* through the mouth,\nConnecting with Earth—\nThus, the mouth is called *pin*.\nBy *root*, they mean *primordial* (元).\nThe gateway of the nose and mouth\nIs where the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth\nFlows in and out.\n\nThe earlier statement that the *spirit of the valley* does not die\nEncourages people to understand the principle of nurturing the *spirit*.\nThis passage on the *gateway of the mysterious female*\nIllustrates the further development of refining the form.\nThus, those who perfect both form and *spirit*\nAre the ones who can align with the Dao.\n\nWhen humans have a body and a *spirit*,\nThen there is life and death.\nLife and death cannot be spoken of as the Dao.\nFlowing and changing without constancy—\nHow could it be called *stillness*?\n\nIf one empties their form and *spirit*,\nForgets distinctions of self and other,\nThen emergence has no root—\nThus, *qi* gathers without being called life,\nAnd return has no orifice—\nThus, *qi* disperses without being called death.\nNeither life nor death—\nThis is the *spirit of the valley*.\nLife and death without constancy—\nThis is the floating and changing of things.\nProfound stillness, feminine tranquility,\nSerene and unmoving—\nThis is the *mysterious female*.\n\nContinuous as if ever-present,\nYet effortless in its application.\nContinuous—\nThe appearance of ceaselessness—\nThis concludes the meaning of nurturing the *spirit* and refining the form.\n\nTo nurture the *spirit* is to reach profound mystery and obscurity,\nPurity, stillness, and emptiness,\nContinuous as if ever-present,\nResponding to things without ceasing.\nTo refine the form is to breathe the Great Harmony,\nGuide and connect the blood and *qi*,\nDrink the *elixir* of the endless spring,\nChew the herbs of longevity,\nAnd ensure the limbs and joints remain unobstructed without labor—\nOnly then can one align with the roots of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd share the gateway with all marvels.\n\nThe *valley* is the Great Emptiness,\n*Creation* is the *spirit*—\nThe *mysterious female* nurtures all things,\nContinuous and unending—\nThus, it is followed by the saying *Heaven endures, Earth persists*.\n\n*Heaven endures, Earth persists*—\nA standard.\nHeaven, through its vast *qi* and forms,\nHas not tilted from ancient times to now,\nHence it is called *enduring*.\nEarth, through its solid substance and capacity,\nRemains eternally steadfast and unchanging,\nHence it is called *persisting*.\nThis concludes the analogy and establishes its meaning in the following text.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure and persist\nBecause they do not generate themselves—\nThus, they can achieve eternal life.\nThis concludes the meaning.\n\nHeaven endures in purity,\nEarth persists in tranquility,\nBecause they cover and nourish all things,\nAnd extend their nurturing to all beings—\nYet they all draw upon the wondrous origin,\nReturn to the boundless void,\nAnd restore to the profound stillness,\nWithout boasting of their own creative power,\nAnd thus they uphold their constant *virtue*—\nHence, they can endure and persist eternally.\n\nAnother interpretation says:\nHeaven, Earth, and all things\nTransform uniquely and naturally,\nAll discerning their own essence,\nYet none seeking to prolong or augment their life—\nThus, they can endure and persist eternally.\nThis is a solemn warning.\n\nHence, the Sage follows his own body while his body precedes others,\nSets aside his body while his body remains.\nThe Sage acts without action,\nHis body in the hall of state,\nYet his mind wanders in *Maoshu* (姑射).\nHe follows the pattern of Heaven and Earth’s covering and nurturing,\nAnd distributes nourishment impartially.\nHe has greatness yet practices humility,\nAnd does not dare to take precedence over the world.\nHis people delight in his guidance without wearying of its joy,\nThey are pushed forward without resentment—\nThus, his body precedes others.\nHe can also forget his merits and name,\nSet aside his body and reduce his desires.\nThe world loves him as a father and mother,\nThe *spirit* and clarity of Heaven protect him as an innocent child—\nThus, his body remains.\n\nIs it not because he has no self-interest?\nHence, he can achieve his own interests.\nHeaven and Earth generate all things,\nYet the Sage, setting aside himself, benefits all people—\nNone rely on their own benevolence,\nHow could there be a heart of self-interest?\nIt is truly without self-interest.\nWithout self-interest, he can endure and persist,\nAnd because he endures and persists,\nHe is like one who can achieve his own interests.\n\nMaster Li Yue says:\nHe who does not selfishly hoard for himself,\nYet gives generously to others—\nOthers’ selfishness may not succeed,\nBut his own will be fulfilled.\n\n*The Profound and Distinct Interpretation* says:\nWhen Gongyi Xiu governed Lu,\nHe loved fish,\nAnd when the entire state offered fish to him,\nHe did not accept it.\nHis disciples remonstrated:\n“Master, you love fish—\nWhy do you not accept it?”\nHe replied:\n“It is precisely because I love fish,\nThat I do not accept it.”」\n\n「Though he receives fish and is spared from serving as prime minister,\nEven if he loves fish, he cannot provide fish for himself—\nWithout receiving fish, he is not spared from serving as prime minister,\nYet he can still long provide fish for himself.\nThis is the understanding of one who acts for others while benefiting himself.\n\nThus it is said:\nIt is not because he lacks self-interest that he fulfills his own.\nThe Riverbank Master (河上公) and Master Yan Junping (严君平) wrote: *\"because he lacks self-interest.\"*\nWang Bi’s ancient text read: *\"It is not because he lacks self-interest that...\"*\nThe Kaiyuan Imperial Edition (开元御本) states: *\"It is not because he lacks self-interest that...\"*\nEach has its own meaning—let the reader consider them carefully.\n\nThe Sage’s later body, having transcended the self,\nCan be public to himself while private to others,\nSoft and yielding yet beneficial to all things—\nThus he is ranked above as *the highest virtue is like water*.\n\n*The Daoist Classic of Authentic Perfection* (*道德真经*), in the *Palace Treasuries* (*藏室*), *Mù Wēi* Chapter (*慕微篇*), Volume One concludes.\n*The Daoist Classic of Authentic Perfection*, *Palace Treasuries* (*藏室*), *Zhuǎn Wēi* Chapter (*纂微篇*), Volume Two begins.\nCompiled by Bìxū Zǐ (*碧虚子*) Chén Jǐngyuán (*陈景元*).\n\n*The Daoist Classic* says:\nThe highest virtue is like water.\nThe *highest virtue* (上善) refers to the standard for humanity (标人).\n*Like water* (若水) is a metaphorical illustration (举喻).\nHe whose aspirations are for others, whose heart is empty and desireless,\nWho adapts to circumstances and follows the times,\nDoes not oppose the myriad things,\nAnd in virtue forgets virtue—\nThus he is called *the highest virtue*.\n\nWater can solidify or dissolve, conform to depths or shallows,\nFlow or sink, follow the Dao and embrace emptiness—\nAll these have their principles.\nOnly the Sage comprehends and harmonizes them all,\nThus he is like water.\n\nWater embodies the Dao’s three near-qualities (三能之近道)\nAnd seven virtues of benefit to all (七善之利物),\nAs explained in the following passage.\n\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwelling where others abhor—\nThus it is near the Dao.\nThis is the first of the three near-qualities.\n\nWater’s nature is calm and still,\nYet it spreads and nourishes all things.\nWithout water, the sky would be parched and dry,\nAnd the earth would be dusty and turbulent.\nIt benefits and nourishes all things,\nThus it is called *virtuous in beneficence*—\nThis is the first virtue.\n\nWater is the gentlest and weakest of all things,\nYet it yields to emptiness, rejecting solidity,\nAvoiding heights and seeking depths—\nBlocked, it stops; pressed, it flows.\nIt submits to all things,\nThus it is called *non-contending*—\nThis is the second virtue.\n\nThough men’s nature is to abhor what is low and impure,\nWater dwells in the depths and accepts filth—\nIt does not shun what others abhor,\nYet it cleanses all things, making them pure and white,\nBearing all insults alone,\nDwelling where others abhor—\nThis is the third virtue.\n\n*Near* (几) means *approaching*.\nWater benefits all things,\nThus its benevolence is vast and boundless—\nIt does not contend,\nThus its virtue is modest and radiant—\nIt dwells in what others abhor,\nThus its capacity endures defilement.\nBy illustrating water’s three near-qualities,\nOnly the Sage embodies them in a unified virtue and conduct—\nFar from straying from the Dao,\nThus it is said: *near the Dao*.\n\nAnother explanation:\nWater is *qi* (气),\nThe ruler of the North (毋王於北方),\nIts number being six.\nThe North is the beginning of Yang virtue (阳德)\nAnd the end of Yin *qi* (阴气).\n\nThe number of life is one, the same as the Dao—\nThe Dao is also called one.\nThe Dao’s one is *the one that transcends all ones* (无一之一),\nWater’s one is *the one that contains all ones* (有一之一).\nThe one that transcends all ones is the essence of the Dao,\nThe one that contains all ones is the manifestation of the Dao—\nThus water, as the Dao’s manifestation,\nIs said to be *near the Dao*.\n\nResidence (居), virtue of the land (善地);\nHeart (心), virtue of the depths (善渊);\nGiving (与), virtue of benevolence (善仁);\nSpeech (言), virtue of trustworthiness (善信);\nGovernance (政), virtue of rectitude (善治);\nAffairs (事), virtue of ability (善能);\nAction (动), virtue of timeliness (善时).\n\nThe Sage’s residence is virtuous in holding low and modest,\nFollowing things naturally—\nHis influence extends to his village,\nLike water flowing beneath the earth,\nDwelling in the depths and low places,\nNourishing all things—\nThus it is said: *virtuous in residence*—\nThis is the first virtue.\n\nThe Sage’s heart is virtuous in preserving emptiness and stillness,\nPiercing the profound and subtle,\nClear and penetrating—\nLike the depths of water, tranquil and undisturbed,\nThough nine changes occur in its waves,\nIts clarity and stillness remain unaltered—\nThus it is said: *virtuous in heart*—\nThis is the second virtue.\n\nThe Sage in giving is virtuous in practicing benevolence,\nHis kindness extending to all under heaven,\nWithout favoring kin or loved ones—\nLike water’s oiliness, nourishing all,\nRising and falling with ease,\nNothing escapes its reach—\nThus it is said: *virtuous in giving*—\nThis is the third virtue.\n\nThe Sage’s speech is virtuous in upholding sincerity,\nNot relying on external agreements,\nYet naturally harmonizing—\nLike water’s reflection, without discrimination of beauty or ugliness,\nFilling to the brim before it moves—\nFlowing through dangers without loss—\nThus it is said: *virtuous in speech*—\nThis is the fourth virtue.\n\nThe Sage in governance is virtuous in rectifying the people,\nHis bearing upright and understanding profound—\nThings submit naturally—\nLike water’s clarity, settling high and low,\nPurifying and cleansing all things,\nRemoving all dust and filth—\nThus it is said: *virtuous in governance*—\nThis is the fifth virtue.\n\nThe Sage in affairs is virtuous in ability,\nAssigning roles according to aptitude—\nNo one is left unplaced—\nLike water’s gentleness, accommodating all shapes and vessels,\nNothing it handles fails—\nThus it is said: *virtuous in affairs*—\nThis is the sixth virtue.\n\nThe Sage in action is virtuous in timeliness,\nEmerging and retiring as circumstances demand—\nHis conduct preserves the Dao—\nLike water’s movement, adapting to the times—\nIn winter, it solidifies; in summer, it flows—\nIt never deviates from its proper course—\nThus it is said: *virtuous in action*—\nThis is the seventh virtue.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\nIs there no resentment against it.\n*Only* (唯) means *alone* (独).\nThis concludes the discourse on the three near-qualities and seven virtues above.\n\nThe Sage’s thoughts, conduct, and words,\nHis emergence and retirement—\nAll are complete in the wondrous Dao,\nConforming to the needs of things,\nYet ever maintaining *feminine* (雌) stillness,\nNot contending with all things—\nIf things do not contend with it,\nHow could there be grounds for blame or resentment?\n\nAgain, *resentment* (尤) means *grudge* (怨).\nIt is said that only the Sage, who is alone in not contending,\nHas no one to blame or resent.\n\nThe Dao’s essence is emptiness and nothingness,\nYet water’s number is one—\nOnly when the Sage employs it,\nDoes it approach the Dao.\nIt is also good at holding yet not overflowing,\nThus it is ranked next with *holding yet overflowing* (持而盈之).\n\n*Holding yet overflowing* (持而盈之) is not as good as *early cessation* (其已).\n*Overflowing* (盈) means *full* (满),\n*Cessation* (已) means *stop* (止).\nHe who clings to fullness and overflowing,\nYet does not know humility and moderation,\nWill inevitably see his downfall.\nTo avoid such ruin,\nIt is better to seek early cessation—\nThis is *laying down arms* (垂械).\n\nMaster Yan Junping (严君平) wrote: *\"accumulating yet overflowing\"* (殖而盈之),\nReferring to amassing wealth and treasures.\n*Measuring yet sharpening* (揣而锐之) cannot be long preserved.\n*Measuring* (揣) means *calculating* (度).」\n\n「Again, this is about *governance* (治). *Truly sharp* (锐) means *keen and cutting* (铦利). It speaks of how people know only of their sharp, greedy desires, yet pursue wealth and honor with reckless abandon, yet fail to discern the calculated folly (揣度) of their passions, and to govern themselves with moderation (思治侨恣). When misfortune comes, it cannot be long preserved.\n\nMaster Yan Junping (君平) said: *\"Wealth and honor to me are like ascending a mountain to gaze endlessly—*\n*Power and status pass like a fleeting bolt of lightning.*\nThis is to say they cannot be long preserved.\"\n\n*The *Honglie Jie* (《鸿烈解》) records: White Gongsheng (白公胜) seized a state’s treasury but could not distribute its wealth. After seven days, Shi Qi (石乞) entered and said: *\"What is gained unjustly cannot be kept, and if you cannot share it, disaster will surely come.\"* Unable to give to others, he only brought harm to himself. White Gongsheng did not heed this warning. On the ninth day, Ye Gong (叶公) arrived and opened the treasury’s stores to distribute among the people, while also raising taxes to fund soldiers. White Gongsheng attacked him, but nineteen days later, he was captured.\n\nTo claim a state that is not rightfully yours,\nYet fail to share its wealth,\nIs to be the most avaricious (至贪).\nTo take without giving to others,\nYet lack the wisdom to benefit oneself,\nIs to be the most foolish (至愚).\nCompare White Gongsheng’s fate to the *Ur* (臬) who loved his son—\nHow different is it?\n\nThus it is said:\n*Holding yet overflowing* (持而盈之) is not as good as *early cessation* (其已),\n*Measuring yet sharpening* (揣而锐之) cannot be long preserved.\nGold and jade fill the halls,\nYet none can keep them.\nThis illustrates the inevitable truth:\n*Fullness cannot be long held.*\n\nGold and jade in a chamber\nMay only moisten the house,\nYet when a great thief arrives,\nHe will seize baskets and bags in haste,\nThough wise men may dwell within,\nNone can guard them.\nThus even beasts know this—\nThe elephant fears the hunter’s blade and loses its tusks,\nThe rooster dreads sacrifice and sheds its tail.\nEven beasts recognize this,\nYet how do humans fail to reflect?\n\nMaster Yan Junping (严君平) and Wang Bi (王弼) wrote: *\"Gold and jade fill the chamber\"* (金玉满室).\nWealth and honor, if indulged in excess (侨),\nBring ruin upon oneself.\n*遗* (遗) means *to bestow* (与).\nWealth invites others to seek it,\nSo one easily deceives himself.\nHonor makes others subservient,\nSo one easily oppresses others.\nDeceit and oppression grow daily,\nDisaster and blame will surely follow—\nThis ruin is self-inflicted, is it not?\n\nMaster Yan Junping (君平) further said:\n*\"Gold and jade harm the body,*\n*Status and power corrupt the spirit—*\nLike ice and fire,\nThey cannot coexist.\"\nThus, *status is the spirit’s impurity* (名者神之秽),\n*wealth is the body’s harm* (利者身之害).\nNurturing the spirit’s impurity,\nAccumulating the body’s harm,\nDamages what is already achieved,\nAnd aids what is already flawed.\nGaining them brings benefit,\nLosing them brings ruin—\nThen one’s thoughts are muddled,\nAnd his discernment of gain and loss is perverse.\n\nAgain he said:\n*\"Those who increase my wealth*\n*Diminish my spirit,*\n*Those who bring me fame*\n*Destroy my body.*\nMisfortune arises from within myself,\nNot from others.\nFortune arises from within myself,\nNot from heaven.\"*\n\nMaster Lu Xisheng (陆希声) said:\n*\"To hold a great office yet overflow with arrogance (满盈),*\nThough one fears it,\nIt is better to cease early.\nTo occupy a high position yet exceed its limits (亢极),*\nThough one worries,\nIt is better to withdraw early.\nTo calculate power and wealth yet sharpen one’s ambitions (锐意),*\nThough one gains them,\nThey cannot be preserved forever.\nTo hoard gold and jade while the halls overflow,*\nThough one possesses them,\nThey cannot be kept long.\nIf one is honored yet extravagant (侨), he invites disaster;\nIf one is wealthy yet extravagant (侨), he multiplies his faults.\nHubris grows within the heart,\nAnd its punishment comes from oneself—\nWhy blame heaven or reproach others?\"*\n\n*\"Great deeds accomplished,*\n*Fame secured,*\n*Then step back—*\nThis is the Dao of heaven.\nWhoever understands this,\nKnowing when to advance and retreat,\nTo preserve or perish,\nIs the Sage indeed.\nExternal fullness injures life—\nRather than sharpen one’s focus on wealth and honor,\nIt is better to embrace simplicity (抱一) and avoid blame,\nThus follows the teaching: *Carry the vital essence (营魄), embrace unity (抱一).*\n\n*Carrying the vital essence (载营魄), embracing unity (抱一),*\nCan one truly remain undivided?\n\nThe Daoists say:\n*The spirit of yang is called *hun* (魂),*\n*The hun delights in life,*\n*The shade of yin is called *po* (魄),*\n*The po favors death.*\n*The hun roams,*\n*The po remains still.*\n\n*The *Baihu Tong* (《白虎通》) states:*\n*\"The hun is the wandering essence,*\n*Qi is the undetermined form,*\nThus the hun is called *ying* (营).\"*\nThe old commentary says:\n*载* (载) means *to bear* (乘).\n*营* (营) refers to the *hun* (魂).\nIt is also said that *ying* (营) means *to protect the yang qi*.\nThe *hun* is the yang essence,\nThe *po* is the yin spirit.\nThe yang essence favors movement and wandering,\nThus Daoist scriptures speak of *restraining and retaining* (拘留).\nThe yin spirit favors agitation and deception,\nThus Daoist scriptures teach methods of *subduing and controlling* (制伏).\nIf one’s form and essence always bear the yang essence and yin spirit,\nAnd embrace the pure, unified *tàihé* (太和) *qi*,\nKeeping them from scattering,\nThen one may forever preserve longevity.\n\nThe Dao’s embrace of unity (抱一)\nIs like a *yì* (镒) containing its brilliance—\nCan brilliance ever separate from the mirror?\nThis teaches how to nurture the spirit (养神).\n\nNow I explain:\nIf one seeks to guard unity (抱一之卫),\nOne must keep the heart undivided.\nIf the heart remains undivided,\nThen it is bearing the *hun* and *po*,\nAnd embracing the pure, unified Dao.\nCan one be like an infant (婴儿)?\nThe following passages are all interpreted in this way.\n\n*Concentrating qi to achieve softness (专气致柔),*\nCan one be like an infant?\n\nThe old commentary says:\n*专* (专) means *unified* (一) and *to entrust* (任).\n*Qi* (气) is the *chōnghé miàoqì* (冲和妙气) of harmony and subtlety,\nAnd also the natural *qi* of the body.\nWhen a person stands alone, distinct from all else,\nHe receives the natural, harmonious, and subtle *qi*.\nAs *qi* descends and form is born,\nIt remains untainted and pure.\nIf one concentrates and entrusts oneself to this harmonious, subtle *qi*,\nForgets all perceptions and knowledge,\nThen *qi* will naturally remain pure and harmonious,\nAnd the body will naturally be soft and weak,\nUnharmed by the evils of others—\nThis is attaining the infant’s complete harmony.\nThis teaches how to nurture *qi* (养气).\n\nNow I explain:\n*\"Can one be like an infant?\"*\nIt means:\nIf one seeks to guard *qi* through concentration and softness (专气致柔之卫),\nOne must be like an infant in purity and harmony.\nIf one can be like an infant in purity and harmony,\nThen one has attained the guarding of *qi* through concentration and softness.\n\n*Washing away impurities, gazing into the profound (涤除玄览),*\nCan one be without blemish?\n\nThe old commentary says:\n*涤* (涤) means *to wash* (洗).\n*除* (除) means *to dispel* (遣).\n*玄览* (玄览) is *mind’s illumination* (心照).\n*Blemishes and flaws* (疵瑕) are *diseases* (病).\nOne must wash away dust and filth,\nDispel the five passions (五情),\nKeep inner and outer purity,\nIllumine all things with the mind—\nThen blemishes and flaws, like diseases,\nWill vanish without trace.\nThis teaches how to cultivate the heart (修心).」\n\nFrom here, the three matters above exhort one to cultivate the person;\nFrom here, the three matters below urge one to govern the state.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Cultivate it in the person, and its virtue becomes true;\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal.\"*\n\nNow it is explained:\nIf one seeks to wash the heart, dispel filth, and fathom inner and outer affairs,\nAnd can reflect upon oneself without blemish or disease,\nThen this is the method of *washing away and profound illumination*.\n\nCan one govern the people with love and the state without action?\n\nThe old commentary says:\n*\"To govern the state is to love the people as one’s own children.\nIn administering affairs, one must not be harsh or cruel;\nTaxes and labor must not harm their nature.\nOne should focus on agriculture, simplify governance,\nAnd let the people pursue their occupations in peace,\nThus ensuring their well-being—\nThis is the transformation of *wuwei*.\"*\n\nNow it is explained:\nIf a ruler seeks to nurture the ten thousand people without harming their natural endowment,\nAnd governs by fostering agriculture while keeping affairs clear and still,\nThen this is the art of loving the people and governing the state.\n\nCan one be receptive like the female principle?\n\n*The Heavenly Gate* is the gate of Nature.\nNature gives birth to the *Taiji*;\nThe *Taiji* gives birth to Heaven and Earth;\nHeaven and Earth give birth to yin and yang;\nYin and yang give birth to the ten thousand things;\nThe ten thousand things live and die through it, coming and going—\nThus it is called the *Heavenly Gate*.\n*Opening* means to disperse and give;\n*Closing* means to gather and withdraw.\nWhen it opens, life flourishes;\nWhen it closes, things decay and perish.\nThough it gives birth to all things, one does not see its *generating*;\nThough it brings death to all things, one does not see its *destroying*.\nLife and death unfold unseen—\nHow could it not be called Nature?\n\nOnly the *Great Person* can embody Nature.\nThe *Great Person* encompasses the universe in measure,\nAnd contains yin and yang in *qi*.\n\nThrough receptive stillness,\nThe transformations of life and death, rise and decline\nDo not enter the mind.\n\n*Receptive stillness* is the subtle function of Nature.\nThis warns those who cultivate the person and govern the state\nTo guard with receptive stillness.\n\nThe old commentary says:\n*\"The *Heavenly Gate* is the gate of the Northern Pole within the Purple Enclosure.\nHeaven has the Northern Pole, with stars within the Purple Enclosure,\nAnd within the enclosure are the Five Emperors,\nWho take turns in their reigns—\nThus the gate opens and closes.\nWhen it opens, it is *Tai* (harmony);\nWhen it closes, it is *Pi* (blockage).\nThus, in spring, the Green Emperor’s gate opens,\nWhile the others close—\nAnd the seasons follow this pattern.\nMoreover, the Five Phases cycle endlessly,\nAnd the changes of time and fate are unceasing.\nOnly the sage knows Heaven and follows the Mandate,\nEver guarding receptive stillness,\nThus never swayed by change—\nHence eternal prosperity and great good fortune.\n\nSome interpret this in terms of personal cultivation:\nThe *Heavenly Gate* refers to the nose and mouth;\n*Opening and closing* refers to breathing and exhalation.\nSpeaking of one who is receptive, still, and yielding,\nTheir breath becomes deep and subtle,\nContinuous and refined,\nNurturing the spirit in effortless ease.\"*\n\nNow it is explained:\nThe opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate* in its cycles\nIs the natural order of time—\nOnly by being receptive and humble\nCan one remain unmoved by yin and yang,\nUnchanged by cold and heat.\n\nCan one be clear and open in all directions?\n\nCan one be without knowing?\n\nThe old saying speaks of *day’s clarity*—this is wisdom’s illumination.\nThough one cultivating the self may possess this luminous wisdom,\nAnd though their ears and eyes are sharp and their understanding vast,\nIf they lack perception and hearing,\nThen the one governing the realm must cultivate virtue as bright as the sun and moon,\nIlluminating the four quarters of the land—\nYet they must block their ears and veil their eyes,\nAnd act as though they know nothing.\n\nTo make the people of the world live unaware in their daily lives—\nThis is called *the Dao*.\n\nNow it is explained:\nTo attain wisdom and clarity in all directions,\nOne must first withdraw the senses and return to stillness,\nEver guarding *non-knowing*—\nThis is the root of clarity and boundless understanding.\n\nTo nurture and preserve,\nTo give birth yet not possess,\nTo act yet not rely upon it,\nTo grow yet not control—\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\nSpeaking of cultivating the self and governing the realm,\nIf one practices these six principles,\nIt is like the Dao’s generation—\nThings are not obstructed at their source;\nThey are left to complete themselves naturally.\n\nAnd in nourishing virtue,\nThings are not constrained in their nature;\nThey are left to complete themselves naturally.\n\nThus, virtue shines forth alone,\nAnd only the sage is born—\nHow could this be otherwise?\n\nAll creatures attend to their own affairs—\nWhat does the sage rely upon?\n\nThings grow and nurture themselves—\nWhat does the sage control?\n\nThis is to forget merit, forget things,\nPierce the depths of obscurity—\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\nWang Bi says:\n*Mysterious Virtue* is having virtue yet not knowing its master,\nEmerging from the depths of darkness.\n\nEmbrace the One without departing from focused *qi*,\nAchieve the harmony of an infant—\nWhen harmony is attained, all things return as spokes converge to the hub,\nThus the thirty spokes unite in one hub.\n\nThe thirty spokes unite in one hub—\nWhen the hub is empty, the wheel’s function is realized.\nThis illustrates how *having* and *non-having* support each other in utility.\n\nThe *Zhou Li: Kao Gong Ji* states:\nThe carriage’s canopy is round to symbolize Heaven’s vehicle,\nIts square base follows Earth’s law,\nAnd the thirty spokes symbolize the number of days in a month.\n\nThe moon hangs in Heaven, flowing endlessly,\nThe wheel rolls across Earth, turning without end.\nThus, the carriage symbolizes the moon—\nThirty days complete one month,\nJust as thirty spokes unite in one hub.\n\nWhen the hub’s center is empty, the wheel can turn.\nThe carriage’s emptiness allows it to bear its load.\nThus, the void’s emptiness holds the function of turning and bearing.\n\nJun Ping said:\nIn the age of ancient sages governing the people,\nThey followed what Heaven and Earth naturally did,\nAnd did not contrive clever artifices.\nThey drank from gourds, ate with their hands,\nAnd all things were equal, with no high or low.\n\nWhen rulers began to act,\nTaxes grew heavy, labor burdensome,\nThe people exhausted—\nThe upper classes no longer sang,\nTribute came from afar,\nMen and women bore loads they could not bear.\n\nThus, the wise invented the *pushing-hub carriage*,\nHitching horses and oxen to bear heavy burdens over long distances,\nEasing the people’s toil.\n\nLater generations followed suit,\nAnd clever creations multiplied—\nCarved and painted hubs,\nGilded wheels adorned with silver and jade,\nAnd emerald pendants—\nThe cost of one carriage could impoverish a family.\nThus, Laozi lamented how artificial contrivances harm morality,\nAnd how doing good can breed chaos.\n\nHence, the three things—carriage, tools, and dwellings—\nIllustrate how *having* and *non-having* mutually support utility,\nAnd serve as a warning.\n\nMixing clay to make vessels—\nWhen the center is empty, the vessel’s function is realized.\n*Cao* means blending,\n*Ni* means clay—\nThe artisan blends and molds clay,\nShaping it into vessels,\nTaking the empty space within to hold all things.\n\nJun Ping said:\nIn times when morality decays,\nWorries assail from within,\nAnd yin and yang harm from without—\nThe people grow weak, emaciated, and sickly.\nThus, water and fire arise together,\nThe five flavors take form,\nRaw and cooked are indistinguishable,\nDrying and moistening are confused.\nHence, the wise mix clay to make vessels,\nTo cook sour and salty foods,\nAnd eventually indulge in hunting, luxury, and licentiousness,\nSlaughtering creatures and cracking eggshells to please the ruler,\nCarving jade into bowls and plates,\nRefining crude materials into tools—\nUntil it reaches this point.\n\nPiercing doors and windows to make dwellings—\nWhen the center is empty, the dwelling’s function is realized.\n*Zao* means to pierce.\n\nHalf-door and daily door.\nThe window beside the door is called *yǒu* (牖).\nDoor, window, and *yǒu*—these are also general terms.\n\nIn ancient times, when dwelling in caves,\nOne would pierce and hollow out the earth within,\nCovering it above to form doors and windows for dwellings.\nTaking the empty space within the dwelling,\nHumans found a place to rest, enter, and exit.\n\nJun Ping said:\nOnce human hearts change,\nAll things harbor resentment—\nWorms and snakes rise,\nPoisonous silkworms act,\nBirds and beasts harm people.\nThus, even caves prove insufficient\nTo defend against calamities,\nPreserve life,\nOr complete one’s natural years.\n\nTherefore, the wise constructed dwellings—\nRoofs above, eaves below,\nWindows pierced for observation,\nSturdy gates and firm closures,\nSwiftly opening and shutting,\nSo that wasps and insects could not enter,\nAnd beasts could not approach.\nOnly then did it lead to ornate pavilions,\nLofty towers,\nThe Alang Palace’s halls,\nGreat gates guarding strategic passes,\nFortified cities,\nSoldiers exhausted and dying in countless numbers.\n\nYet what was considered governance in ancient times\nIs seen as chaos in later ages—\nThis stems from the mutual drawbacks of *you* (有) and *wu* (无),\nFor it lies in human nature itself.\n\nThus, *you* is used for advantage,\nAnd *wu* is used for function.\nThis resolves the three matters above,\nIllustrating that *you* and *wu* mutually rely on each other\nAnd neither can be discarded.\n*You* is used for advantage—advantage lies in vessels.\n*Wu* is used for function—function lies in emptiness.\n\nThe utility of vessels\nMust exist externally,\nDrawing on emptiness to fulfill their purpose.\nThe function of emptiness\nMust be internally void,\nBorrowing from vessels to achieve its use.\n\nThus, *wu* relies on *you* for advantage,\nAnd *you* relies on *wu* for function.\n\n*Wu* aligns with the Dao,\n*You* manifests as vessels.\nThat which is above form is called the Dao.\nThe Dao is formless.\nThough the Dao is formless,\nIt must rely on *you* to display its efficacy.\nThat which is below form is called vessels.\nVessels have substance.\nThough vessels have substance,\nThey must rely on *wu* to fulfill their function.\n\nThus, vessels without the Dao cannot be applied,\nAnd the Dao without vessels cannot display its function.\nIt is like the hub having spokes,\nVessels containing things,\nDwellings housing people—\nAll rely on *wu* to benefit *you*,\nAnd on *you* to utilize *wu*.\n\nAs for cultivating the body,\nThe spirit is the advantage for sustaining life,\nEmptiness is the function for attaining the spirit.\nThus, *wu* enables function,\nAnd *you* benefits things.\nThe advantage of *you* lies in sustaining life,\nWhile the function of *wu* lies in attaining the spirit.\n*Wu* is the state of emptiness and tranquility,\n*You* is the state of spiritual clarity.\n\nSpiritual clarity is the subtle *you*,\nEmptiness and tranquility is the ultimate *wu*.\nThe advantage of subtle *you* lies in sustaining life,\nThe function of ultimate *wu* lies in attaining the spirit.\nThe advantages and functions of sustaining life and attaining the spirit\nDo not exceed subtle *you* and ultimate *wu*.\n\nThe establishment of chariots and tools\nUses *wu* to benefit *you*—\n*Wu* is emptiness,\n*You* is form,\nThus, it follows with the five colors.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate.\n\nThe five colors were originally established\nTo manifest the symbols of the Five Phases,\nWith *fǔfù* (黼黻) patterns and decorations\nDistinguishing the adornments of rank—\nThis is the proper use of the five colors.\nYet later generations indulged in brocades and silks,\nWith green and yellow pleasing the eye,\nChasing external objects,\nDraining vitality and impairing vision,\nUnable to perceive the color beyond color—\nWhat else but blindness?\n\nThe five tones were originally established\nTo manifest the sounds of the Five Phases,\nWith metal, stone, silk, and bamboo\nHarmonizing the *qi* of Heaven and Earth—\nThis is the proper use of the five tones.\nYet later generations composed *Zheng* and *Wei* music,\nWith licentious melodies pleasing the ear,\nIndulging without restraint,\nShaking the spirit and blocking hearing,\nUnable to listen to the sound beyond sound—\nWhat else but deafness?\n\nThe five flavors were originally established\nTo manifest the harmony of the Five Phases,\nWith salt and vinegar moderating,\nNourishing human relationships—\nThis is the proper use of the five flavors.\nYet later generations craved bear’s paw,\nWith coarse meats delighting the palate,\nGluttony without end,\nCorrupting the spirit and defiling purity,\nUnable to taste the flavor beyond flavor—\nWhat else but dullness? *Cuan* (爽) means loss,\n*Cha* (差) means error.\n\nGalloping in hunts drives the mind to madness.\nHunting is the state’s customary ritual,\nTo practice martial affairs\nAnd demonstrate the seasons to the people.\nThe Son of Heaven and feudal lords\nEach year held three hunts:\nOne for *gān dòu* (乾豆) offerings,\nTo sacrifice at ancestral temples.\nOne for guests,\nTo foster goodwill between states.\nOne to replenish the ruler’s kitchen stores in season.\nIf hunting is not done in season,\nIt is called disrespectful.\nHunting out of season\nIs called ravaging nature.\nThus, spring searches, summer inspects seedlings,\nAutumn fills stores, winter hunts.\nIf one does not follow these laws,\nGalloping recklessly across borders,\nExhausting wildlands without restraint,\nHarming crops and farmers,\nClimbing cliffs and crossing dangers,\nThe mind and spirit grow disordered—\nWhat else but madness?\n\nValuable goods cause one to act recklessly.\nGold, silver, jade, and pearls—\nThese are rare treasures.\nIf one greedily pursues them without measure,\nOr ceaselessly seeks them,\nThe Dao becomes obstructed and injured,\nAnd the body suffers labor and humiliation.\n\nJun Ping said:\nWhen the five colors are excessive, the world grows blind;\nWhen the five tones are harmonized, the world grows deaf;\nWhen the five flavors are balanced, the world grows dull;\nWhen hunting flourishes, the world grows mad;\nWhen jade and pearls are prized, the world grows weary;\nWhen currency and silk circulate, the world grows impoverished.\n\nThus, the five colors are like daggers piercing the eyes,\nThe five tones are like mallets blocking the ears,\nThe five flavors are like blades severing the tongue,\nAnd hunting is the leader of madness.\n\nPursuing distant goods brings ruin,\nAnd valuing difficult-to-obtain things brings scarcity.\nAll these things\nTransform and generate one another,\nUnfathomable and endless,\nDifficult to clarify yet easy to extinguish,\nDifficult to obtain yet easy to lose.\n\nCalamities and disasters\nAre the chambers of peril and annihilation.\nSeeking them brings self-harm,\nDwelling in them brings self-destruction.\n\nThis is both a warning to the sovereign\nAnd instruction to the common people.\n\nThus, the Sage prioritizes the belly over the eyes,\nAnd so discards the former to take the latter.\n\nThe Sage refers to the ruler who follows the Dao.\n\nThe ruler who follows the Dao allows his mind to wander beyond sound and color, while nurturing the boundless inner radiance. The belly—when it receives nourishment and fills with substance—does not chase after things, thus preserving its wholeness and attaining spiritual sovereignty. Therefore, the Sage follows this principle and prioritizes the belly.\n\nThe eyes—when they fixate on colors and cause disorder—lead one to chase after things, thus blinding the outer senses and dissipating vital essence. Therefore, the Sage warns against this and does not indulge the eyes.\n\nTo \"discard the former and take the latter\" means to abandon the eyes' pursuit of things and embrace the belly's inner completeness.\n\nIndulging in the pleasures of sound and color leads to slaughter and disgrace, while not valuing hard-to-obtain goods brings honor and prosperity. Thus, honor and disgrace follow.\n\nHonor and disgrace are like sudden alarms.\nHonor refers to wealth, nobility, celebrations, and rewards—all that is fortunate.\nDisgrace refers to poverty, humiliation, punishment, and misfortune—all that is calamitous.\n\nThose who grasp the Dao regard the body as a temporary lodging, and life and death as burdensome afflictions. They neither rejoice in prosperity nor fear adversity, knowing that official rank and external possessions are mere transient dependencies. How could honor and disgrace bind their hearts and cause constant alarm?\n\nThis speaks of honor and disgrace as sudden alarms—words meant for the average person.\nThe moderately wise, dwelling in safety yet mindful of peril, fearing disgrace even in honor, thus react as if alarmed.\nCommon folk flee toward trivial pursuits, alarmed by disgrace, while the moderately wise, observing the fundamental Dao, are alarmed by honor—hence, \"honor and disgrace are like sudden alarms.\"\n\nTo hold great afflictions as one’s own body.\n\"Great afflictions\" refers to official rank, treasures, and external possessions that sustain life.\nThe perfected one knows the body is not truly theirs, yet they still cling to externals—how much more so do they cling to what they revere?\n\nNow, people of the world claim that official rank and treasures can sustain life, thus valuing them as their own body, unaware that both the body and external things are the roots of great sighing and are unworthy of reverence.\n\nWhat is meant by \"honor and disgrace\"? Honor is superior; disgrace is inferior.\n*(Original note: The *Kaoyuan* text reads \"honor is inferior, disgrace is superior.\")*\nIt means that when one attains wealth and nobility, relying on honor leads to arrogance and ruin. If ruin comes from honor, then honor is the root of disgrace—thus, \"honor is inferior.\"\n*(Original note: The *Heshang Gong* and *Huangfu Mi* texts also read \"honor is superior, disgrace is inferior,\" meaning gain is superior, loss is inferior.)*\nTo gain is like being alarmed; to lose is like being alarmed—this is called \"honor and disgrace are like sudden alarms,\" concluding the meaning.\n\nThe vulgar cling to their wealth and rank—holding them brings trembling, losing them brings sorrow. They do not understand that gain and loss are not truly theirs, so they are all seized by alarm.\nThe moderately wise know that fortune and misfortune cycle like a knot. If one enjoys honor and prosperity, decay and disgrace will inevitably follow, so they guard against overreaching, fearing loss as they would alarm.\n\n*The Liezi* says: Zhao Xiangzi sent envoys to attack Di, capturing two cities yet wearing a worried expression. He said, \"I have great virtue and heavy deeds; how can I not be vigilant?\" Confucius heard this and said, \"The Zhao clan will surely flourish—this is gaining as if alarmed.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"to hold great afflictions as one’s own body\"? My greatest affliction is that I have a body. When I have no body, what affliction do I have?\n*(The repeated \"what is meant by\" marks a question-and-answer structure to introduce the following explanation.)*\nThe reason one has great affliction is that they have a body.\nThe human body, lacking fur or feathers to resist cold and heat, must rely on external things to nourish life and preserve existence. Yet those who cling excessively to life often court death, and thus great sighing follows.\nThis arises from being ensnared by worldly attachments, clinging to the idea of having a body.\n\nIf one transcends the body, no longer treating it as their own, forgetting the mind and no longer treating it as their own, merging with the natural transformations and aligning with all things—moving as if dragging dead wood, sitting as if gathering cold ashes—then the former afflictions of honor, disgrace, and great peril, what harm can they bring?\nThus it is said: *When I have no body, what affliction do I have?*\n\nIn *\"On Equality of All Things,\"* Zi Cha said to Yan Yan: \"Now I have lost myself—do you know this?\"\n*(Original note: \"Lost\" here means \"forgotten\" or \"transcended.\")*\nTo abandon illumination and attain seated forgetfulness is to still greater afflictions—how much more so for those who naturally merge with existence?\n*(Original note: Some interpret \"no body\" as annihilation or emptiness, but this misses the essence of Laozi’s teaching.)*\n\nThus, to hold the body as precious for the sake of the world is to be able to entrust the world to it.\nTo love the body as precious for the sake of the world is to be able to deposit the world in it.\nFrom the perspective of transcending the body upward, this broadly addresses how common people and scholars are seized by honor and disgrace, leading to great affliction.\nFrom the perspective of valuing and loving downward, it specifically speaks of rulers who have not yet forgotten the world, hence the language of entrustment.\n\nYet the idea of entrustment is not the virtue of the highest Sage. If one’s heart wanders in tranquility, blends with the boundless, follows nature without artifice, then one may restore the winds of antiquity.\nLu Xi-sheng said: If one’s heart is disturbed by gain and loss, clinging to external things, then honor and disgrace never bring lasting peace, and fortune and misfortune never cease. How can such a one govern the world or hold the great position within the realm?\n\nOnly those who hold the body as precious for the world’s sake, loving the body as precious for the world’s sake, truly value and love the world, not their own bodies.\nThus, gain and loss lie beyond them, and worries and afflictions do not cling to their person. Even so, they dare not claim dominion over the world—how much less would they seize it as their own?\n\nThis is the Way of Great Dao, the intent of the public realm.\n*(Original note: The *Kaoyuan* text reads: \"Thus, to hold the body as precious for the world is to be able to entrust the world; to love the body as precious for the world is to be able to deposit the world.\" The commentary says: This chapter begins with a warning against honor and disgrace, concluding with the idea of entrustment. If one is alarmed by honor and disgrace, they have not forgotten them; if they value and love [the body], they have not forgotten [their attachments].\")*\n\nThus, comparing disgrace to honor, disgrace is not as worthy as honor;\ncomparing virtue to love, virtue is not as profound as love.\n\nThose alarmed by honor and disgrace still cling to their hearts;\nthose who cherish virtue and love have not yet forgotten the world entirely.\n\nHence, first, one must make the alarm of honor akin to disgrace,\nthen seek to forget both honor and disgrace entirely.\nUsing the near-name of entrustment, one argues for the ultimate of forgetting both—\nforgetting honor and disgrace means nothing remains to alarm,\nforgetting the body means no root for affliction,\nforgetting the world means no need for the near-name of entrustment.\n\nThe *Wang Bi* text reads:\n*\"Thus, if one values the body for the sake of the world, then one can entrust the world.\nIf one loves the body for the sake of the world, then one can deposit the world.\"*\nWang Bi’s commentary states:\n*\"There is nothing to exchange for the body, hence ‘virtue’—\nthus one can entrust the world.\nThere is nothing to diminish the body, hence ‘love’—\nthus one can deposit the world.\nOnly when honor and disgrace, glory and calamity,\ndo not diminish or exchange the body,\ncan the world then truly be entrusted.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi: \"Zai You\"* chapter’s citation is taken as definitive,\nwith Wang Bi’s text ranked secondary.\nThe commentary aids in elucidation, though its phrasing is inferior.\nIt is suspected that the *Kaoyuan* text’s collation may have added or omitted passages,\nthus losing the original intent.\n\nWhen both honor and disgrace alarm, the mind is not yet free—\nonly those who conform to the Way are effortless and formless,\nhence the progression to *\"what cannot be seen.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: \"Thus one can entrust the world.\"\nSince there is nothing to diminish the body, it is called **\"Yī\"**—\nthus one can deposit the world.\nWhen honor and disgrace, glory and calamity,\ndo not diminish or exchange the body,\nonly then can the world truly be entrusted.\n\n**Yī** (原本作 *jī*), in ancient texts, refers to the subtle and formless.\nThe *Yìjīng* says: \"Subtle (*jī*) is the faintest stir of movement.\"\nThough this meaning exists, it is now preserved but not discussed.\n\nThat which cannot be heard is called **\"Xī\"** (希).\nThat which cannot be grasped is called **\"Wēi\"** (微).\nThese three—**Yī**, **Xī**, and **Wēi**—\ncannot be summoned or invoked,\nso they are merged into one.\nThe Dao is difficult to describe and define,\nthus the Sage names it with reluctant necessity.\n\nThe Dao is not a visible thing,\nyet cannot be seen with the eyes—\nthus, within the formless,\nit manifests all forms,\nand is therefore called **Yī** (夷).\n**Yī** means \"level\"—\nit describes the boundless, tranquil state\nwhere, though present in form,\nthere is no form at all.\n\nThe Dao is not a sound,\nyet cannot be heard with the ears—\nthus, within the silent,\nit gives rise to all sounds,\nand is therefore named **Xī** (希).\n**Xī** means \"sparse\"—\nlike objects scattered thinly,\nwithout striking or touching,\nit is sound yet not sound.\n\nThe Dao is not a shape,\nyet cannot be grasped by the hands—\nthus, within the shapeless,\nit takes on all shapes,\nand is therefore called **Wēi** (微).\n**Wēi** means \"wondrous\"—\nit is subtle and profound,\nwithout substance or boundary,\nyet is shape without shape.\n\nOnly the **Perfect Sage** (至人) perceives with the spirit\nthe formless form of the Dao,\nand emerges beyond all forms.\nWith **qi** attuned, he hears the soundless sound,\nand emerges beyond all sounds.\nWith the mind discerning, he grasps the shapeless shape,\nand emerges beyond all shapes.\n\nThese three—**Xī**, **Yī**, and **Wēi**—\nare forced names for the Dao’s operation,\nnot its true, inherent existence,\nso they cannot be examined or questioned.\nThus, they should be merged and understood as the supreme unity.\n\nJun Ping says:\n*\"Before the great wild goose (*hóng*) is fully formed,\ncut open its egg and look inside—\nit is not yet the goose,\nyet its shape, sound, head, and tail\nare all already present.\nThis is the formless goose within the egg.\nHow much more so,\nwhen even the egg of the goose does not yet exist,\nand yet the Transforming Power (*zàohuà*) creates it!\"*\n\nFrom this, it is clear:\nThe origin of the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*),\nbefore Heaven and Earth,\nalready contains subtle traces of shape and sound,\nthough unseen and unheard.\nThus, it is evident:\n\nThose who do not see with the eyes can see,\nthose who do not hear with the ears can hear,\nthose who do not follow with the hands can grasp,\nthose who do not speak with words can explain.\nTherefore, the shapeless shape,\nfrom which Heaven and Earth arise,\nis called **Yī** (夷).\nThe soundless sound,\nfrom which the five tones begin,\nis called **Xī** (希).\nThe formless trace,\nfrom which myriad things emerge,\nis called **Wēi** (微).\n\nThese are the paths the ancient sages pointed toward.\nIf one forgets seeing and hearing,\ntruly follows and grasps,\nand merges all into boundless unity,\nthen the Dao is fully attained and exhausted—\nnothing more can be added.\n\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nits lower depths are not dark.\nEndless and unbroken, beyond naming,\nit returns to the formless.\n**Yī** (绳绳) means endless continuity,\nwithout bounds.\n\nThis is called the **indescribable state** (*wúzhuàng zhī zhuàng*),\nthe **formless image** (*wúwù zhī xiàng*),\nor **dim and vague** (惚怳).\n\nTo return to the formless is not to speak of emptiness—\nit means that within the stateless state,\nall forms are created,\nand within the imageless image,\nall things are transformed.\nTo say \"it exists\" would be wrong,\nyet things arise from it—\nthis is **having without having**.\nTo say \"it does not exist\" would also be wrong,\nyet things arise through it—\nthis is **having without having**.\nExistence and nonexistence are indeterminate—\nthis is called **dim and vague** (惚怳).\n**Hū** (惚) is \"nonexistence,\"\nyet speaks of nonexistence as if it were existence.\n**Huàng** (怳) is \"vague,\"\nyet speaks of existence as if it were nonexistence.\nThus, it is called **dim and vague**.\n\nApproach it, yet you cannot see its head.\nFollow it, yet you cannot see its tail.\nThe Dao precedes Heaven and Earth,\nand endures beyond the ancient past—\nhow did it come into being?\nNo one knows its origin,\nthus you cannot see its head.\nYet it persists through all ages,\nand extends beyond countless eons—\nhow does it end?\nNo one knows its conclusion,\nthus you cannot see its tail.\n\nThis is what prompts one\nto clear their **spiritual platform** (*língtái*)\nand model themselves after the Dao’s essence.\n\nTo hold the ancient Dao\nand govern the present is to know\nthe origin of antiquity—\nthis is called the **principle of the Dao** (*dàojì*).\nThe ancient Dao is formless and nameless,\nthe root of Heaven and Earth,\nthe ancestor of all things—\nthe Dao that cannot be seen or heard.\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ*’s method for cultivating the self and the world\nis to uphold the ancient, natural Way of nonaction (*wúwéi zìrán*),\nto restrain the present’s artificial, vexatious customs (*yǒuwéi fánnǎo*),\nand to return to simplicity,\nrecovering the **Supreme Beginning** (*Tàishǐ*),\nso that each may rectify their nature and life—\nnot shifting their virtue—\nthis is called the **framework of the Dao’s principle**.\n\nSeeing and hearing cannot be summoned,\ndim and vague beyond form—\nonly the **good scholar** (*shànshì*)\ncan hold the ancient Dao\nand govern the present’s artificiality.\n\nThus, it follows with the **good scholar of antiquity** (古之善为士者).\nThe *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* concludes here.\n\n**The True Classic of the Dao and Virtue: *Zàngshì Zuǎnwēi* (Volume Three)**\n*Compiled by Bìxū Zǐ Chén Jǐngyuán*\n\n**The Dao Classic**\n\nThe **good scholar of antiquity**—\nsubtle, profound, and ineffable,\ndeep beyond recognition—\nwas one who, in the **Supreme Beginning**,\ngoverned self and realm\nthrough the natural Way,\nhis virtue vast yet hidden,\nhis spirit bright yet distant,\nhis wisdom piercing the void,\nhis sincerity unobstructed.\nThus his bearing was profound and thick—\nwho could truly know the *Lǎozǐ*?\n\nFor the Dao seems great yet appears unworthy,\nas when **Liezi** dwelt in Zheng\nyet none could recognize him—\nthis was the **good scholar of antiquity**.\n\nSince he could not be known,\nhe feigned outward form.\nThe **good scholar of the Way**,\nhis virtue deep and boundless,\ndifficult to discern,\nfearing later ages might lack his model,\nthus he spoke of his bearing and demeanor,\npointing out his conduct and posture—\nthis is the **lower text**.\n\n**Like winter crossing a river,**\n*Yù*—hesitant, as if—\nthe **good scholar of the Way**,\nfollowing nature without resistance,\nneither hastening fortune nor provoking calamity,\nyet in all actions, cautious and reserved,\nthough walking smooth paths,\never wary of drowning,\nas in bitter winter’s month,\nventuring across a long river,\nhis heart hesitant yet doubtful,\nfearing to sink into unfathomable depths.\n\n**Like fearing four neighbors,**\nthe **good scholar of the Way**,\never treading the void yet daring no action,\nin retreat or engagement, deeply contemplative,\nfearing judgment in the realms of light and dark,\nas common folk avoid taboos,\ndreading neighbors’ secret knowledge—\nthis is the depth of his caution.\n\n**Solemn as a guest,**\nthe **good scholar of the Way**,\nupright and composed,\nhis mind undistracted,\nlike a guest before his host,\nhow dare he act hastily?\nHis words: *\"No action, no doing.\"*\n\nAs **Shùngé Shùnzǐ** bound his belt and straightened his bearing,\nhis presence dissolved all intent—\nthus **Tiánzǐ Fāng** revered him as teacher.\n**Lǐshè Guāng** dwelt in darkness,\nas if before sovereign and parent—\nthus **Sīmǎ Zǐwēi** praised him deeply.\nThis is called **solemn as a guest**.\n\n**Dissolved like ice about to melt,**\nthe **good scholar of the Way**,\nthough outwardly stern,\nhis mind at ease, his wisdom unfettered—\nlike spring ice thawing,\ndissolving and dispersing,\nall rigidity gone.\n\n**Sincere as uncarved wood,**\n*Sincere*—in its pure thickness.\n*Uncarved*—in its undivided simplicity.\n*Uncarved*—before form’s division.\nThe **good scholar of the Way**,\nnaturally thick and pure,\nspeech and silence both unadorned.\n\n**Vast as a valley,**\n*Vast*—in its breadth.\n*Valley*—in its hollow void.\nThe **good scholar of the Way**,\nhis virtue thick yet unseen,\nhis capacity wide yet encompassing,\nbearing good and ill alike,\nlike an empty valley’s echo—\nalways void.\n\n**Mixed as muddy water.**\n*Mixed*—as waves churn.\n*Muddy*—when clarity is lost.\nThe **good scholar of the Way**,\nhis heart serene within,\nyet outward currents swirl—\nlike turbid water’s obscurity,\nhow could beauty or ugliness be distinguished?\n\nThe seven matters above:\nif applied to ruling a realm,\nthe people know not, understand not,\nreturning to the **Supreme Beginning**;\nif applied to cultivating the self,\nharmonizing with dust and light,\nobscured in the **Ultimate Way**—\nwho could muddy then clarify?\nStillness brings gradual clarity.\n\nThe **good scholar of the Way**,\nhis heart like a deep spring—\nmuddied yet settling,\nstillness brings its clarity.\n\nWho could remain steadfast yet endure?\nMovement brings gradual life.\nThe **good scholar of the Way**,\nhis virtue fragmented—\nwhen steadfast, enduring,\nmovement brings life’s fullness.\n\nAn old saying claims:\nThe **Perfect One** outwardly appears mixed and indistinct,\nyet within, pure and clear—\naligned with the Dao’s essence,\ngradually ascending,\nborrowing from clarity’s truth.\n\nAgain, for the scholar’s sake,\nfearing to dwell in this gradual clarity,\nlong yet unchanging,\nlodged in all phenomena,\nthus urged to move, seek superior methods,\nuntil life’s gradual unfolding,\nno longer clinging to forms,\nreaching unbroken generation.\n\n*One variant reads:*\nWho could muddy then still—gradual clarity?\nWho could remain steadfast yet move—gradual life?\n\n**Preserve this Way without excess.**\nOnly by not being full\ncan one endure decay without renewal.\nHe who guards this gradual clarity and life,\nwell knows humility in self-cultivation,\ndwelling in emptiness and stillness.\n\nOnly by not being full—\nagain, the **Perfect One** alone,\nnot boasting of completeness,\nthus ever clinging to decay’s humility,\nthough new achievements arise,\nhe holds victory unmoved,\nseeks further progress,\npursues higher virtue,\nnot resting in small gains—\nthis is the **Sage’s** profound path.\n\nThe **good scholar** follows antiquity,\nhis insight deep and subtle,\nsincere, uncarved, vast and hollow—\nattaining the **Way of the Hollow Valley’s Extremes**,\nthus it follows with **attaining the Extremes of Emptiness**.\n\n**Attaining the Extremes of Emptiness,**\n**Guarding Stillness Firmly.**\n*Attaining*—obtaining.\nHe who, desireless,\nattains the **Void’s Way**,\nreaches the **Obscure’s Extremes**,\nyet steadfast in stillness,\nhis virtue becomes pure and thick.\n\n*The *Lièzǐ* says:*\nNone surpasses stillness,\nnone surpasses emptiness—\nstillness, emptiness,\nobtaining their dwelling.\n\n*The *Xīshēng Jīng* says:*\nIf one empties and does nothing,\nnot desiring the Way,\nthe Way itself returns.\n\n*Yán Jūnping said:*\nDao and virtue are empty and void,\nthus able to receive and bestow.\nHeaven and Earth are clear and still,\nthus able to transform.\nYin and Yang alternate,\nthus able to give and take.\nSun and Moon advance and retreat,\nthus able to shine.\nThe four seasons begin and end,\nthus able to nurture and complete.\n\nRemove emptiness and void—\nDao and virtue cannot endure.\nRemove clarity and stillness—\nHeaven and Earth cannot exist.\nAdvance without return—\nYin and Yang cannot circulate.\nMove without retreat—\nSun and Moon cannot illuminate.\nEnd without beginning—\nAll things cannot live.\n\nThus:\nHaving yet returning to nonhaving,\nfull yet returning to emptiness,\nthe heart bearing nothing,\nthe will displaying nothing,\ndoing nothing as if blocked,\nunworried as if mad,\nembracing truth, treading simplicity,\nabandoning cleverness,\nnot knowing what is first,\nemptiness as constant—\nthen spirit and clarity reach their peak,\nnaturally exhausted.\n\nThe movement of action returns to the self,\nwhile thought and contemplation restore the spirit.\nHide me within the heart of no-mind,\ncarry the form within the body of no-self.\nWhat does not benefit life,\ndo not use it to enslave the will.\nWhat does not accord with Heaven,\ndo not use it to scatter the spirit.\n\nWhen matters are simple yet the spirit remains unshaken,\nwhen inner flow does not alter the outer,\nwhen vision is inverted and hearing is reversed,\nand the spirit moves in harmony—\nabove aligning with the Dao of Heaven,\nbelow engaging with the world—\nthe spirit remains undisturbed,\nvital qi unstrained,\nnaturally embracing contraction and extension,\nthus attaining the Middle Way.\n\nWhen all things act in concert,\nI observe their return.\nHuman beings are born in stillness—\nthis is the nature of Heaven.\nNow, those who speak of attaining ultimate emptiness\nand steadfastly guarding stillness\nare guiding people to return to their wondrous origin.\nThis is not merely for humanity.\nTruly, when all things move together,\ntheir origin has never failed to begin in profound tranquility,\nemerging from formlessness,\nborn of harmonious qi,\nresponding to transformation.\nWhen observed in their return,\nthey exhaustively revert to the boundless void,\nreturning to the trackless,\nthus preserving their true form.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Return—does it not reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth?\"*\nThe heart of Heaven and Earth is profound stillness unto nothingness.\n\nJun Ping said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth return and invert,\nthus able to endure eternally.\nHumans return to sleep,\nthus able to attain clarity.\nFlying birds return to gather,\nthus able to soar high.\nRunning beasts return to rest,\nthus able to leap far.\nDragons and serpents return to their coils,\nthus able to shine resplendent.\nGrasses and trees return to their roots,\nthus able to remain verdant.\nWhen transformation returns,\nspirit and clarity attain their proper place,\ncommuning with the void and nothingness,\nthe soul resting, the vital breath at ease,\neach finding its place—\nthe will tranquil, the qi harmonious,\nthe blood and vital essence in balance.\nEven this temporary return to stillness\npreserves the spirit—\nhow much more so for those who endure in the ultimate Dao!\"*\n\nAll things, teeming and flourishing,\neach return to their root.\nReturning to the root is stillness;\nstillness is returning to the vital command;\nreturning to the vital command is constancy.\nTeeming—luxuriant in growth—\nrefers to plants and grasses.\nSome say *yún yún*—\nmoving and acting, teeming and numerous—\nrefers to flying and walking creatures.\nBy analogy, though movement and stillness differ,\nall return to their root.\nThe void is the boundless and formless;\nstillness is profound and silent.\nThe boundless and silent—\nthis is the root of movement and stillness.\n\nMoreover, the nonbeing is the origin of being,\nstillness is the sovereign of agitation—\nwhen movement reaches its peak,\nit must return to stillness;\nwhen being reaches its limit,\nit must return to nonbeing.\nThe roots of grasses and trees are heavy,\nresting low in stillness,\nthus they thrive.\nFlowers and leaves are light,\nresiding above in movement,\nthus they wither and fall.\nIf even things abide thus,\nhow much more so for humanity?\n\nTherefore, the Sage offers analogies\nto make the people abandon their love of desires,\nreturning to the root of emptiness and stillness,\nthus restoring the origin of their nature and vital command.\nThe origin of nature and vital command—\nthis is the boundless and obscure,\nwhere sight does not perceive and hearing does not hear.\nThis is only for the wise to awaken to themselves.\n\nThose who awaken to it\nwalk, stand, sit, and lie outside of emptiness and stillness,\nyet respond to change without deviation—\nthese are those who attain constancy\nand return to the vital command.\n\nTo know constancy is clarity.\nTo not know constancy is reckless action—disaster.\nThis speaks to the difficulty of the constant Dao,\nyet even understanding it is enlightenment.\n\nThose who awaken to the constant Dao\npossess spirit that transforms without bounds,\nnature that communicates with all,\nqi that harmonizes with all—\nthey do not know of all things as \"me,\"\nnor of \"me\" as all things,\nthus able to tread upon water and fire,\npierce metal and stone,\nreverse mountains and rivers,\nshift cities and towns,\nride the void without falling,\ntouch the solid without breaking—\nthousand transformations, ten thousand changes,\ninexhaustible—\nthis is the spirit aligned with the constant Dao.\n\nThe next level:\ntheir essence and vitality unwaning,\ntheir visage like a maiden’s,\ndwelling in the world for millennia,\nborne aloft to immortality—\nthis is the form aligned with the constant Dao.\n\nThe next level:\nspeech and silence follow principle,\nconduct and retreat accord with the times,\naction aligns with the Yang’s rhythms,\nshining yet not dazzling,\nstillness aligns with the Yin’s virtue,\nusing obscurity to attain clarity—\nworldly burdens cannot harm them,\ntheir bodies free from blame—\nthis is the ability to wield the constant Dao.\n\nIf governing the body is the foundation,\nthen wielding the constant Dao is supreme.\nThus, it is said: *\"To know constancy is clarity.\"*\nOr, *\"To grow ever clearer\"*—\nthis is the doctrine of gradual enlightenment.\nHaving awakened to the constant Dao,\none must follow as described above.\nThose who fail to awaken to the constant Dao\ninstead take spiritual transformation for monstrosity,\nlong life for falsehood,\nultimate emptiness and steadfast stillness for hollow retreat,\ninjuring vitality as annihilation—\nthey do not know strong knowing,\ndo not recognize strong discernment,\nevery thought false and deceptive,\nevery action disastrous and easy—\nthis is *\"not maintaining virtue\"*—\nor bearing its shame.\nThus, it is said: *\"Reckless action brings disaster.\"*\n\nTo know constancy is tolerance;\ntolerance is impartiality;\nimpartiality is sovereignty;\nsovereignty is the Way of Heaven;\nthe Way of Heaven is the Dao;\nthe Dao is enduring—\nliving without peril.\n\nThose who know the constant Dao\nrespond to all things with benevolence,\nsaving without abandoning,\nembracing without exclusion.\nEmbracing movement and stillness without selfishness,\ntheir bosom opens boundlessly,\nachieving true impartiality.\nTrue impartiality without selfishness\nspreads virtue universally across the world,\nwith none failing to return.\n*\"Sovereign\"* means \"to go forth.\"\nWhen people return,\nHeaven will aid them—\nby nature, they oppose nothing,\nthus called *True Persons*.\nThey emerge from being, enter nonbeing,\nobscurely vast and all-pervading,\nenduring with the Dao,\ninexhaustible—\nwater and fire cannot harm them,\nmetal and stone cannot maim them,\nworldly calamities cannot assail them—\nwhat peril could there be?\n\nAttaining emptiness, guarding stillness,\nreturning to the root, restoring the vital command—\nthis is to know constancy.\nThose who know constancy walk the path of the Great Above,\nthus ranked beneath the *Supreme Above*.\nThe *Supreme Above*—\nthe sovereign of primordial antiquity,\nunnamed and unmarked—\nthe *\"Highest Virtue that is not virtue.\"*\nIts virtue cannot be surpassed,\nthus called *Supreme Above*—\nthough it holds sovereign rank,\nit does not claim exaltation,\nletting all things act naturally,\neach rectifying their nature and vital command.\nThus its teaching is effortless,\nits governance untraceable,\nactions arise with the times,\nresources are leveraged for achievement—\nthe people use it daily without knowing its Dao,\nonly knowing of their sovereign above.\n\nThe sovereign—what power does he hold over me?\n\nZhuangzi said: In the age of supreme virtue, the worthy are not exalted, the capable are not employed. The ruler stands like a pole marking a branch, the people move like wild deer—upright and proper without knowing it as *righteousness*, loving one another without knowing it as *benevolence*. They act without leaving traces, perform deeds without leaving records. This is the age of the *Supreme Above*.\n\nThe next stage: they are cherished, they are praised. As supreme virtue declines and *benevolence* and *righteousness* become prominent, those who benefit from *benevolence* grow close and attach themselves, those who embrace *righteousness* praise and elevate them. Zhuangzi said: When the sage arrives, he bends and stretches to create *benevolence*, he stands on tiptoe to establish *righteousness*, and thus the world begins to doubt. Doubt gives rise to cherishing and praise.\n\nAgain he said: Shun had his natural conduct, and the people delighted in him, so he moved his capital three times to Chengdu. Yao, hearing of his virtue, raised him to high office and then abdicated in his favor—this is the stage of cherishing and praising.\n\nThe next stage: they are feared, they are scorned. When *benevolence* and *righteousness* fade and penal laws are established, when penal laws are strict, the people fear them. Though laws are strict, those who rely on cunning and deceit will transform the people, leading them to fraud and deception—this is when the people’s scorn of their ruler runs deepest.\n\n*The Profound and Mysterious* says: In the age of the *Supreme Above*, virtue spreads naturally—this is when the people merely know of their sovereign above. The next stage is to prevent them from doing wrong—this is the stage of cherishing and praising. The next stage is to reward the virtuous and punish the violent—this is the stage of fear and scorn.\n\nTrust is insufficient, so distrust arises. Sincerity is when the heart loves truly; faithfulness is when words can be relied upon. When trust is complete, the world is secure; when trust is lost, the world is in peril. Now that cunning and deceit have flourished and fraud is rampant, the ruler’s trust is lacking among the people, so distrust answers in kind.\n\nThe ruler’s influence over the people is like the reflection of a bright mirror—its form is clear, its logic unerring. Wang Bi said: When the body’s nature is lost, disease arises; when the essence of things is distorted, flaws and conflicts emerge. When trust is insufficient, distrust follows—this is the natural order.\n\nYet even this is better than reckless speech. From the stage of cherishing downward, the way of the *Supreme Above*’s effortless transformation is already lost, unable to restore the purity of antiquity. Even so, it still values speech and teaching, clinging to old methods as the means of transformation. Though far from the Dao, it is still better than reckless speech leading to distrust and rebellion.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled, the people say, *\"This is natural.\"* The ruler of the Dao governs with passive ease, so achievements are completed without claim, his silence and stillness profound—thus affairs are settled and forgotten. The people are pure and unadorned, doing nothing in vain, saying, *\"This is simply natural.\"* Where then do the hearts of cherishing, praising, fearing, and scorn arise?\n\nThe old saying: *\"Trust is insufficient, so distrust arises\"*—this explains *fearing* and *scorning*. *\"Yet even this is better\"*—this explains *cherishing* and *praising*. *\"When deeds are accomplished...\"*—this again echoes the stage where the people merely know of their sovereign above. To rigidly adhere to old interpretations is not followed here.\n\nThe *Supreme Above*’s effortless virtue is not manifest. When *benevolence* and cherishing arise, the *Great Dao* is abandoned, so it is ranked below. When the *Great Dao* is abandoned, *benevolence* and *righteousness* emerge. The *Great Dao* is the ancient way of effortless transformation. *\"Abandoned\"* means both hidden and decayed, no longer practiced. When the people’s hearts are not pure, the *Great Dao* is hidden and decayed; supreme virtue is not practiced.\n\nThen the seven forms of artificiality gradually arise, and *righteousness* and *profit* grow excessive. Thus, the pure is shaped into vessels—this is when the *Great Dao* is abandoned, giving rise to the seven forms of artificiality.\n\nZhuangzi said: Fish forget one another in the rivers and lakes; people forget one another in the states of Dao and Wei—this illustrates the age of the *Great Dao*. When *comprehensive love* becomes *benevolence* and *judging wrong* becomes *righteousness*, then *benevolence* and *righteousness* arise from insufficiency. This is like fish stranded on dry land, splashing each other with muddy water, moistening one another with saliva—not as good as forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes. This explains how the *Great Dao*’s abandonment gives rise to the seven forms of artificiality.\n\nWisdom emerges, and great deceit follows. When purity is lost and the *Great Dao* is abandoned, wisdom arises, and with it, great deceit—this is the natural order. Zhuangzi said: The true nature of the horse is to graze, drink, and lift its legs as it walks. When happy, it nuzzles and rubs necks; when angry, it rears and kicks. This is all the horse’s wisdom. But when the master of horses tames it—with bit and bridle before, whip and spur behind, the yoke and reins to guide it, and the monthly inspections to refine it—the horse becomes skittish, resistant, fierce, and deceitful, and the cunning of stolen reins is born.\n\nIn the age of antiquity, the people lived without knowing what to do, walked without knowing where to go. They dwelled in contentment and joy, drumming their bellies as they wandered. The people could do no more than this. But when the sage arrived, he bent and shaped *rites* and *music* to regulate the world’s form, he stretched and adjusted *benevolence* and *righteousness* to soothe the world’s heart—and thus the people’s cunning and deceit grew, their sophistry and hair-splitting flourished. This is what is meant by *\"wisdom emerges, and great deceit follows.\"*\n\nThe five relationships are disrupted, and *filial piety* and *affection* arise. The state falls into chaos, and loyal ministers emerge. The five relationships are father, son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife. The *Rites* say: When the *Great Dao* is practiced, one does not love only one’s own kin, nor cherish only one’s own children—true *benevolence* forgets kinship. Those who cherish their kin treat nephews as their own children and serve uncles as their own fathers. When the five relationships are harmonious, where then does *filial piety* and *affection* become prominent? Thus, the people’s reverence for my kin is as it should be for all kin. Therefore, above and below live in harmony, and the bonds of kinship are forgotten.\n\nBut when the teachings of balance are lost and the young harbor superiority, they defy the natural order, so the five relationships are disrupted, and the traces of *filial piety* and affection appear.\n\n「Loyal ministers,\n　　The six kinships—father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife—are thus unified. The *Rites* state: When the *Great Dao* is practiced, one does not favor only one’s own kin nor cherish only one’s own children; true *virtue* forgets kinship. Those who cherish their kin treat nephews as their own children and serve uncles as their own fathers. When the six kinships are harmonious, where then does *filial piety* and *affection* become manifest? Thus, all revere my kin as they should revere all kin. Therefore, above and below dwell in harmony, and the bonds of kinship are forgotten.\n\nBut when the young lack balance and harbor arrogance, they transgress the natural order, disrupting the six kinships, and the traces of *filial piety* and affection then appear.\n\nMoreover, the *Sage* maintains balance, and thus the Four Seas become one family. Wandering in spirit to the *Maoshan* (Maoshan Mountains), one fades away and forgets all of one’s worldly concerns. Then, the ruler above does nothing, yet the people transform effortlessly—where then would there be ministers who pierce their eyes and split their hearts to serve?\n\nThus, the blind and the late-born, the obstinate, are praised as *Shun* is called *Great Filial Piety*, the wise yet austere of *Lu* is praised as *Shen* is called *Able to Nurture*, the upright *Jie* of *Xia* saw *Longfeng* rise, and the perverse *Zhou* saw *Bigan* shine—these are acts of necessity, not of joy.\n\nWhen the *Dao* is abandoned, *virtue* and *righteousness* become prominent; when *wisdom* emerges, great deceit arises. To restore the ancient simplicity, one must extinguish the traces of *Sageliness* and discard cunning *wisdom*—thus comes the teaching of *Discarding Sageliness and Wisdom*.\n\nDiscarding Sageliness and Wisdom, the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\n*Sageliness* refers to the institutions, laws, symbols, and functional relics of the *Sages*.\nTo discard it is to restore their original simplicity.\n*River Upper Master* (Huangshang Gong) said: The Five Emperors’ painted symbols and *Cangjie*’s creation of writing are inferior to the Three Sovereigns’ simple knotted cords without script.\n\n*Wisdom* refers to strategic scheming, calculation, and the manipulative arts of *halong* (纵横).\nTo discard it is to return to *non-action*.\nThe *Classics* say: To rule a state with *wisdom*, it is the state’s ruin.\nIf one does not display the functional relics of *Sageliness* nor employ the manipulative arts of *wisdom*, then craftiness and deceit will not arise, calamities and chaos will not occur, and the people will be like innocent children, devoted solely to agriculture—then their benefit will far exceed a hundredfold.\n\n*Zhuangzi* said: “Abandon minor *wisdom*, and major *wisdom* will become clear.”\nHe also said: “If the *good man* is not found, the *Dao* of the *Sage* cannot stand.\nIf *Zhi* the robber is not thwarted, the *Dao* of the *Sage* cannot prevail.”\nThus, one must discard and abandon these things for the people to truly benefit.\n\nDiscarding *virtue* and *righteousness*, the people return to *filial piety* and *affection*.\n*Virtue* is the love of things, so people grow attached to it.\n*Righteousness* is the proper arrangement of things, so people praise it.\nYet the harm of *virtue* and *righteousness* lies in the attachment and praise they inspire—once attachment and praise are established, the hearts of the people become restless, and the harmony of life and nature is lost.\n\nWhen the harmony of life and nature is lost, how then can *filial piety* and *affection* persist?\nNow, if one discards and abandons them, it is to restore the wholeness of life and nature and revive *filial piety* and *affection*.\n\nDiscarding cleverness and material gain, thieves and robbers will cease to exist.\n*Cleverness* refers to intricate carving, fine craftsmanship, and mechanical devices like locks and keys.\n*Material gain* refers to precious gems, jade, and measuring tools—weights, scales, seals, and tokens.\nThough these mechanical devices and tokens may serve to guard against minor threats, in the grand scheme, they cannot repel great calamities.\nToday, to discard them is like casting aside jade, destroying pearls, burning seals, and breaking tokens—it is to make the people simple and unadorned, so that theft naturally stops.\nThese three teachings—*Discarding Sageliness and Wisdom*, *Discarding Virtue and Righteousness*, and *Discarding Cleverness and Material Gain*—are said to be insufficient as *culture* (文), so they are followed by *Associated Teachings*.\n*Associated* means to follow or continue.\nThe three teachings refer to the aforementioned steps.\nThough one may wish to abandon these three, to restore the ancient simplicity, yet as *culture* and *teachings* handed down, they remain unclear in principle—thus, many find them perplexing.\n\nSeparately, there are the *Associated Teachings* to follow, which will clarify the mind like ice—this is explained below.\n*Seeing Simplicity and Embracing Purity* (见素抱朴), with *few private interests and little desire*.\n*Seeing Simplicity* means preserving one’s natural purity, without mixing in artificial adornments—thus, the traces of *Sageliness* and *wisdom* naturally vanish.\n*Embracing Purity* means returning to one’s original simplicity, without indulging in ostentation—thus, the sentiments of *virtue* and *righteousness* naturally fade.\n*Few private interests* means adhering to one’s proper portion with utmost fairness, not coveting external beauty—thus, cleverness and artifices naturally cease.\n*Little desire* means moderating one’s emotions and living frugally, calm and tranquil—thus, superficial material gain naturally disappears.\n\nThe traces of *Sageliness* and *wisdom* can rescue the near but fail to know the harm they cause to the far; the sentiments of *virtue* and *righteousness* can aid the urgent but fail to recognize their deviation from true nature; the tools of *cleverness* and *material gain* can assist the small but fail to see their danger to the great. Therefore, the *Sage* is bright yet does not display, wise yet does not act, holding only to *Seeing Simplicity and Embracing Purity* as their aspiration, and *few private interests and little desire* as their concern. Thus, ruling a state in this manner, the people attain wealth and longevity, returning to the ancient simplicity, and cultivating oneself in this way, one’s body withers and mind grows empty, fading away like a lost pair.\n\nWhen the traces of *Sageliness* are discarded, cleverness and artifice naturally fade; when *virtue* and *righteousness* are discarded, *affection* and *filial piety* naturally flourish, and kinship grows harmonious. This arises from the harm caused by *scholarship*—thus, it is followed by the teaching of *Discarding Scholarship and Freedom from Worries*.\n\n*Discarding Scholarship and Freedom from Worries*.\nThe *Dao* is vast and difficult to speak of—how can *scholarship* grasp and advance it? Thus, it can be transmitted but not bestowed, obtained but not fully possessed.\nThe case of *Lun Bian* (轮扁) was not one of inability to transmit, but rather of lacking a recipient of suitable quality.\nHow much more so with the *Dao* of the *Sage*!\nToday’s *scholars* are but the dregs and refuse of knowledge.»\n\n「The so-called *Discarding Scholarship* does not mean abandoning learning altogether, but rather preserving one’s innate nature without exceeding its bounds through study. Just as the *Wild Duck’s Way* (凫经) is brief, yet clinging to it brings worry, and the *Crane’s Way* (鹤经) is long, yet severing it brings sorrow. *Lun Bian* (轮扁) and *Shi Guang* (师旷) were born with natural brilliance, yet later scholars often distort the strengths and weaknesses of their innate nature—how could they ever emulate their humble yet proud virtue?\n\nAbandoning such emulation, one finds neither worry nor joy; instead, one follows their natural *qi*, attains the Sage’s heart, and thus what is truly sought is not lacking, while what is vainly discarded is not needed. Those who labor in scholarship yet remain troubled bow their heads and pierce their thighs, seeking only empty fame, or study by candlelight, pursuing only fleeting gain—thus, they are ensnared by honor and disgrace, joy and sorrow. How lost they are!\n\n*Yi* (唯) and *E* (阿) differ by how much? *Shan* (善) and *E* (恶) differ by how much?\n*Yi* (唯) is reverent acceptance; *E* (阿) is complacent assent.\nFrom the perspective of *social norms* (名教), *yi* is reverence while *e* is flattery.\nIn truth, *yi* and *e* both stem from the same voice—how distant their divergence!\n\nIf one forgets the world’s attachments, then the distinction between *yi* and *e* vanishes.\n*Shan* (善) is the praise of *auspiciousness* (吉); *E* (恶) is the label of *inauspiciousness* (凶).\nTo study and practice it is *shan* (善); to neglect study and defy it is *e* (凶).\nThe *Dao* is boundless, profound, and tranquil—how could it be confined to learning or not learning?\n\nThose who pursue *shan* (善) without attaining its essence find ruin in fame,\nwhile those who flee *e* (恶) without avoiding its roots meet destruction in punishment.\nThus, *shan* and *e* are not the true *Dao*—they are external things.\nSince both are external, how different can they be?\nOnly those who *Discard Scholarship* and *Free from Worries*, though they possess the Sage’s wisdom,\nremain unaware of it—how much more so with *shan* and *e*, *yi* and *e*!\n\nSome say: *\"Transform conventional scholarship into true scholarship,\nchange *e* into *yi*, change *e* into *shan*—it is as easy as turning one’s hand!\"*\nThe Sage’s words are of ultimate truth; these are the world’s teachings.\nIf one argues from this perspective, how does it differ from *yi* and *e*?\n\nThe ancients wrote: *\"The distinction between *shan* (善) and *e* (恶) is as follows:\nAs in the previous chapter, all know what is beautiful as beautiful—thus, *e* already vanishes.\nWhat people fear, they must fear.\nThe *Dao* is boundless—its depth is endless.\nThe Sage’s true heart and wondrous *Dao*,\n*Discarding Scholarship* and *Free from Worries*,\nthough they forget *shan* and *e* within their breast,\nmust align with *yi* and *e* in outward form.\nThe warnings of *shan* and *e* must not be disregarded—\nthis is the depth of the Sage’s *Dao*!\n\nThe petty-minded are not so.\nThey admire *shan* yet fail to practice it,\nfear *e* yet do not abandon it.\nThey drown in worldly scholarship,\ngoing forth without return,\nwasting their true nature,\nnever once halting in their folly.\n*Cent* (央) means *center* (中); *Zhi* (止) means *halt*.\n\nThe crowd moves with joy,\nas if feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat,\nor ascending the Spring Platform in springtime.\n*Cent* (熙熙) is the appearance of delight;\nthe *Spring Platform* (春台) is the splendor of the season.\nThis is the way of the common folk.\n\nPeople, through scholarship, adopt falsehoods,\nchase fleeting appearances, and lose their true nature—\ndrowned in the waves of love and desire,\nthey revel in joy,\nlike a starving man before a grand feast,\nhis appetite unfulfilled yet rushing along the path of honor,\nwatching eagerly,\nlike a wandering son ascending the Spring Platform,\nhis heart lost and never returning.\n\nI alone remain still—\nmy state is not yet apparent,\nlike an infant before it smiles,\ncalm and undirected,\nas if having nowhere to go.\n\n*Cent* (怕) means *tranquil*—also, serene and effortless.\n*Cent* (兆) is the initial appearance of form;\n*Cent* (孩) is the look of laughter.\n*Cent* (乘乘) is the movement of *qi*.\nThe Sage’s heart is tranquil and serene,\neffortless and void,\nleaving no trace of form or shape—\nthough amidst the clamor of the world,\nwatching the transformations of things,\nthey gaze blankly,\nlike an infant unable to distinguish laughter or sorrow.\n\nThen, they drift along with the world,\nmixing in its currents,\nriding the crowd’s tide,\nmoving without sharp contrast or vast distinction—\nas if bound for nowhere.\n\n*Cent* (乘乘) is also like a hollow boat drifting east and west,\nwith no fixed destination.\n\n*Cent* (怕) was originally written as *Cent* (魄).\nWang Bi (王弼) rendered it *Cent* (廓).\n*Cent* (乘乘) was originally written as *Cent* (儡儡) by Wang Bi,\nor *Cent* (魁魁) in another version.\n\nThe crowd all have excess,\nwhile I alone seem abandoned—\nthis is the heart of the foolish man,\nundifferentiated and simple.\n\nWhen people’s hearts are bound to things,\nthey cling to appearances as if returning home—\ngluttonous in the pursuit of wealth and honor,\nthey claim their hearts overflow with joy.\n\nThus, the Sage abandons worldly affairs,\nunbinds the *Way of the Scholar* (绅修),\nknowing that honor and disgrace come and go,\nlike a guest departing and a host forgotten—\nthis is the heart of the Sage,\nundifferentiated and vast,\nas if all things are one.\nThe foolish man’s heart is indeed simple and pure—\nthough they say, *\"Is this not the heart of the foolish man?\"*\nIn truth, the Sage’s heart has no distinctions,\nand thus the Sage’s heart is perilously like this.\n\nThe crowd is bright and radiant,\nwhile I alone seem dim.\n*Cent* (昭昭) is the appearance of brilliance,\nshining with talent and skill—\nthus, the Sage’s wisdom encompasses all things,\nyet they never boast,\nas if in darkness.\n\nThe crowd is keen and discerning,\nwhile I alone am dull and broad-minded.\n*Cent* (忽兮) is like the sea—\nfloating, as if bound for nowhere.\n\n*Cent* (察察) means strict and rigid—\nalso, harsh and constrained,\nor proud and self-important.\n*Cent* (闷闷) means expansive and yielding.\nSome render it *Cent* (惛惛)—\nthe appearance of confusion and obscurity.\n\nThe world, through scholarship and governance,\nestablishes strict laws and harsh decrees,\nproudly clinging to artificial *ways*—\nthus, the people barely survive.\nThe Sage follows the *Way of Nature* (天) and aligns with the *Dao*,\nconforming to the world’s flow,\nin yielding and embracing all things—\nthus, the people preserve their true nature,\nliving in broad-mindedness and simplicity.»\n\nZhuangzi said:\n\nAt the utmost extreme of the Dao,\ndim and silent, yet though dim and silent it does not divide,\nobscure and unfathomable,\nyet all things return to it—\nnone know where they go,\nthe myriad folk employ it—\nnone know where it is exhausted.\nIt is skilled in descending and broadly accepting,\nits depths unfathomable—\nthus it is said, like the sea.\n\nAnd yet, the Dao of responding to change\nhas no fixed method—\nlike flowing waves drifting and rising,\nnever settling in place.\nSome render it: *Cent* (忽兮若晦寂), as if bound for nowhere,\nspeaking of the Sage’s bearing suddenly obscured,\nhis mind dwelling in stillness,\nserene and unshaken—\nthis is the ninefold transformation of the waves of Huqiu Zilin.\n\nBoth interpretations are valid,\nbut I follow the first.\n\nThe crowd all have *ways* (有以),\nwhile I alone am dull and broad-minded.\nI alone differ from others,\nyet value *food of the Mother* (食母).\n\n*With* (以), means *employ* (用).\nThe common folk revere learning,\nunable to *act without purpose* (无为),\nyet they must employ some *way*—\nthus it is said, they have *ways*.\n\nThe Sage moves as if dragging a withered tree,\ndwells as if gathering dead ashes,\nnot adorning his form externally—\nthus, he alone appears dull and broad-minded.\n\nThe Sage’s coming and going,\nhis speech and silence,\nare not purposely different from others,\nyet naturally they differ—\nwhy? Because he values employing the Dao.\n\nThose who employ the Dao\nare in harmony with the *transforming of things* (造化),\nthus it is said: I alone differ from others,\nyet value *food of the Mother*.\n\n*Food* (食), means *employ* (用).\n*Mother* (母), is the Dao,\nthe origin.\nSome say *food* (食) means *nourish* (养),\n*Mother* (母) means *spirit* (神).\nThe spirit can give birth to the body—\nthus it is called *Mother*.\n\nThe common folk value desires\nand thereby lose their true form,\nwhile the Sage values *non-desire*\nand thereby nourishes his spirit—\nthus he differs from others.\n\nOthers say:\n*Mother* (母) is *qi* (气).\nThe common folk indulge in flavors,\nwhile the Sage values *food of harmonious qi* (食和气)—\nthus he differs from others.\n\nSome say, \"The Master Lao values blending light with dust to avoid conflict,\nwhy does this passage alone speak of *me and you* (彼我)?\"\nI say, \"This is surely not the Sage’s original intent—\nrather, it is spoken out of necessity.\"\n\nThe Sage’s actions,\nwhat is ever truly different?\nIt is merely that the common folk’s movements and stillness are contrary to the world’s flow,\nso he speaks in response and establishes teachings—\nthus there is *me and you*.\n\nWorries of *transgressing the Dao* (失礼) arise from learning,\nso he follows with the *dimness of the Sage’s bearing* (沌沌若昏).\nThe *virtue/power* (德) of the Sage is vast and luminous—\nthus he follows it with the *bearing of great virtue* (孔德之容).\n\nThe bearing of great virtue\nfollows only the Dao.\n\n*Kong* (孔), means *great* (甚) and *vast* (大).\n*Bearing* (容), means *form* (状).\n*Follows* (从), means *conform* (顺).\n\nThe Sage is one who is in harmony with the Dao.\n\nThe Dao has no name,\nyet *virtue/power* (德) reveals it.\nGreat virtue has no origin,\nit is formed by conforming to the Dao.\nThus, the Sage of great virtue,\namidst all appearances,\nwhat is ever truly seen?\nOnly the bearing of conforming to the Dao—\nshorn and plain, such is his form.\n\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nis only *dim and vague* (倪唯惚).\nThe Dao is remote and difficult to speak of,\nso even the keenest ears cannot perceive it—\nwhat thing can be called *seen*?\n\nNow, when speaking of *things*,\nit is merely to borrow strong names\nto probe the subtle truths.\n\nThe Sage of great virtue,\nable to conform and follow the Dao,\nthe Dao having no form—\nhow can he follow it?\nSince its form is nonexistent,\nand yet it cannot be named—\nhow then can it be followed?\n\nOnly by probing its *dim and vague* (怳惚) nature,\ncan one resonate with its influence—\nits image is formless yet audible.\n\n*Dim* (怳) seems like *having*—\nyet *having* is not *having*.\n*Vague* (惚) seems like *not having*—\nyet *not having* is not *not having*.\n*Not having* that is not *not having*—\nthis is *emptiness as form*.\n*Having* that is not *having*—\nthis is *form as emptiness*.\n*Having* and *not having* are unfathomable,\nyet we borrow images of *things*\nto elucidate the Dao.\n\n*Vague* (惚) and *dim* (怳),\nwithin them lies *image*—\n*dim* (怳) and *vague* (惚),\nwithin them lies *thing*.\n*Image* (象), is *qi manifestation* (气象).\n*Thing* (物), is *spirit-thing* (神物)—\nthat which Zhuangzi calls *True Lord* (真君),\nand which we now call *nature* (性).\n\nThe Dao,\ndim and vague, undetermined—\nif we say it has no *transgression*,\nthen *vague* (惚) naturally emerges from the formless,\ndelighting as it transforms *qi manifestations*—\nbecoming the portents of all things.\n\nIf we say it has *transgression*—\nthen *dim* (怳) arises from the initial *image*,\nand *vague* (惚) dissolves back into *non-being*—\nyet within the utmost *non-being*,\nthere exists *spirit-thing*.\n\n*Spirit-thing* (神物),\nthe unfathomable interplay of *yin* and *yang*—\nthe subtle essence that speaks of all things.\n\nThrough myriad transformations and changes,\nnever exhausted—\ngoverning heaven and earth,\ncreating *yin* and *yang*—\nestablishing *qi* and forming essence,\nbecoming all ten thousand kinds—\nnurturing the body, nurturing the state,\nrefining the coarse into the subtle—\nnone escape the *spirit-thing*.\n\nProfound and obscure,\nwithin it lies *essence*—\nits essence is most true,\nwithin it lies *faithfulness*—\nprofound, in its depth and distance—\nobscure, in its stillness and quietude.\n\nThe Dao,\ndim and vague, cannot be determined—\n*images* of *things* cannot be seen—\nyet profound and obscure,\naskers know not its substance,\nresponders comprehend not its truth—\nwithin it, however, dwells pure *essence*,\nand it holds the *faithfulness of Nature*.\n\nIts transformations are not false—\nthus it is called *true*.\nIts changes respond to the times—\nthus it is called *faithful*.\nLike the crow’s foot becoming the *dish* (跻螬),\nhuman blood becoming *wildfire* (野火),\nrotting melons birthing fish,\nvirtuous women turning to stone—\nthough the movements of growth and decay vary in ten thousand forms,\nnone escape the *essence* sensing and transforming,\nthe *faithfulness* reaching its peak and not failing to change.\n\nWho but the Sage of great virtue\ncould ever comprehend this?\n\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nits name does not fade—\nemploying it to measure the myriad folk.\n\nHow do I know the myriad folk are thus?\nBy this.\n\n*Measure* (阅), means *assess* (度) and *unfold* (披).\n*Folk* (甫), means *origin* (本始).\n\nThe Dao,\nfrom the ancient past to the present,\nserene and ever-present without form—\nthough unseen, its name remains.\nTo liken the Sage who attains the Dao for many years,\nthus able to assess all *things*’ origins,\nknowing they all begin from the Dao—\nthus he unfolds it to complete their forms and essences.\n\nAgain, when asked how I know\nall things derive their *endowment* (资禀) from the Dao,\nand that birth and death, beginning and end,\nare as they are—\n\nI answer:\nThe Dao’s dim and vague, profound and obscure,\never-present without fading—\nthus it can respond to change and govern,\nin stillness and *non-action*—\nassessing the myriad folk’s transformations,\nnone escape deriving their *endowment* from the Dao—\nby this, I know.\n\nThe Sage of Great Virtue,\nconforms to the Dao—\nconforming to the Dao preserves wholeness,\nthus it follows: *What is bent becomes whole.*\n\nThe *Dao De Jing*’s *Hidden Chamber*:\n*Volume Three of the Collected Subtle Chapters* concludes.\n*Volume Four of the Collected Subtle Chapters* begins.\nCompiled by **Bìxū Zǐ** (碧虚子) **Chén Jǐngyuán** (陈景元).\n\nThen it becomes whole;\nwhat is twisted becomes straight,\nwhat is hollow becomes full,\nwhat is worn becomes renewed,\nwhat is few becomes simple,\nwhat is many becomes confused.\n\nThe wise and virtuous scholar,\nbroadly versed in past and present,\nprobing the depths and reaching afar,\nunimpeded in his singular vision—\nthough his talents may coil and bend,\nthey never flaunt themselves—\nfor he seeks to avoid harm and preserve his body.\n\nSharp in hearing, keen in perception,\nhis deeds and achievements manifest,\nhis heart straight as an arrow,\nhis resolve taut as a bowstring—\nyet he bends himself, humbles himself,\nnever extending himself—\nthis is the man of true straightness.\n\nAgain, the Sage does not oppose things.\nWhen things come and bend him,\nhe submits and receives them.\nIf they reflect inward and know their fault,\nthen straightness returns of its own accord—\nthus it is said: *What is bent becomes whole.*\n\nThe rise and fall of hills and valleys,\nhigh and low in constant flux—\nvalleys and gullies, low and hollow,\ndraw water to fill them;\npeaks and ridges, high and steep,\nare eroded by rain and crumble.\nWhen a man is humble and lowly,\nthe multitude reveres and follows him,\nbringing about his radiance and greatness—\nthus it is said: *What is hollow becomes full.*\n\nA man of talent, if he fragments his virtue\nand wears himself thin,\nwill be joyfully promoted by the multitude,\nhis Way ever renewed—\nthus it is said: *What is worn becomes renewed.*\n\nFewness means simplicity.\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"Simple and easy, yet all under heaven’s patterns are achieved.\"*\n\nThe *Xīshēng Jīng* says:\n*\"Hold to One, and all things are complete.\"*\n\nMany means extensive learning.\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"When ornament destroys substance, learning drowns the mind.\"*\n\nThe *Lièzǐ* says:\n*\"Many paths lead to losing the sheep;\nmany studies lead to losing the Way.\"*\n\nThus the Sage embraces One,\nsetting the standard for all under heaven.\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The Dao generates One.\"*\n\nOne is the Dao’s child—\nthe *Tàijí* (太极),\nalso the *Húnyuán* (混元),\nthe pure and unified *qi* of *Tàihé* (太和).\n\nAgain, it is *wuwei* (無為).\nThe Sage embraces and guards\nthe pure and unified Dao of *Húnyuán*,\nrestoring the ancient *wuwei* custom,\nto serve as the standard for all under heaven.\n\nHow is it that One is *wuwei*?\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Heaven, obtaining One, is clear;\nEarth, obtaining One, is tranquil.\"*\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"Heaven, through *wuwei*, is clear;\nEarth, through *wuwei*, is tranquil.\"*\n\nThus it is clear.\n\nFrom *What is bent becomes whole* downward,\nthe six matters still bear traces of counteraction—\nbut *Embrace One* and *wuwei* encompass them all,\nthus becoming the standard for all under heaven.\n\nNot self-displaying, hence clear.\nNot self-righteous, hence manifest.\nNot self-praising, hence effective.\nNot self-aggrandizing, hence enduring.\n\nThese four matters are all marks of *wuwei*.\nThe Sage, practicing *wuwei*,\nnever openly shows his talents—\nyet all under heaven naturally acknowledge his clarity.\n\nRiver-Upper Master says:\n*\"Though the Sage is clear,\nhe does not see a thousand *li* ahead—\nhe uses the eyes of all under heaven to see,\nthus his clarity is thorough.\"*\n\nHe who uses the eyes of all under heaven\nalso does not reveal his own intentions.\nThough the words differ, their meaning is similar—\nthe Sage, empty and tranquil,\nnever asserts himself while denying others.\nSelf and other forgotten,\nall under heaven naturally acknowledge his correctness,\nand his virtue becomes manifest.\n\nThe Sage, serene and undisturbed,\nnever boasts of his merits—\nyet all under heaven naturally acknowledge his achievements.\n\nThe Sage, still and silent,\nnever boasts of his worth—\nyet all under heaven naturally acknowledge his virtue\nand his enduring presence.\n\nOnly he who does not contend\ncannot be contended with by all under heaven.\n\nThe *Honglie Jie* says:\n*\"When Duke Jian of Zhao died and was not yet buried,\nZhongmou surrendered to Qi.\nAfter five days of burial,\nDuke Xiang raised an army to attack it.\nBefore the siege was complete, a thousand *zhang* of the city wall collapsed.\nDuke Xiang struck the bell and withdrew.\nHis officers advised:\n‘Your Highness punishes Zhongmou’s crime,\nyet the city wall collapses—\nthis is Heaven’s aid. Why withdraw?’\nDuke Xiang said:\n‘I was taught by Master Shùxiàng:\n*A gentleman does not exploit another’s advantage,\nnor force him into peril.\nLet him fortify his city,\nthen attack when it is complete.’\nZhongmou, hearing this, begged to surrender.\nThus it is said:\n*Only he who does not contend\ncannot be contended with by all under heaven.*\"\n\nThe ancient saying of *What is bent becomes whole*—\nis this mere empty speech?\nTruly whole, and returned to its source.\n\nThe Sage, pure and unified,\npracticing *wuwei*,\nhow could he harbor contentious intentions?\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"His virtue is as thick as that of an infant—\npoisonous insects do not sting him,\nferocious beasts do not clutch him,\nswooping crows do not peck him.\nEven beasts behave thus—\nhow much more so for humans!\"*\n\nYet in ancient times, there were these words of *bending to wholeness*—\nare they not today’s parables?\nIf a man practices them,\ntruly attaining the perfection of virtue,\nand returning it to himself—\nthis is the profound intent urged again and again.\n\nBending to wholeness, embracing One,\nnot boasting, not praising—\nnot boasting nor praising leads to few words naturally.\n\nFew words naturally,\nlike gusts of wind that do not last till morning,\nor sudden rains that do not last till evening.\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"The words of the virtuous are few;\nthe words of the hasty are many.\nValue their rarity and guard against their excess.\"*\n\nFew and sparse words align with nature.\nThe Sage responds when questioned,\nspeaks when engaging with others,\nmoves and rests according to the time—\nthus aligning with nature.\n\nTo explain winds and rains that come and go as they should\nis beneficial to all things.\nViolent and sudden, they do not persist—\n*piāo* (飘) means fierce,\n*zòu* (骤) means abrupt.\n\nFrom dawn to midday is *zhōngzhāo* (终朝).\nFrom early to late is *zhōngrì* (终日).\n\nWhen mountains and marshes connect,\nthey produce *piāo* winds.\nWhen *yin* and *yang* surge violently,\nthey produce *zòu* rains—\nthis arises from *yin* and *yang* losing their proper order,\nthe harmonious *qi* not blending—\nthus they cannot endure long.\n\n「To liken this to humanity—\nwhen words and deeds clash,\njoy and anger are unchecked,\nhow could purity and harmony not be lost?\n\nWho causes this?\nThe heavens and the earth.\n\nThe heavens and the earth cannot endure long,\nhow much less can humanity?\n\nIf one asks who makes the *piāo* winds and *zòu* rains,\nthe answer is: it is the heavens and the earth.\n\nThe grandest forms are none greater than the heavens and the earth,\nthe broadest *qi* none more vast than *yin* and *yang*.\n\nWhen *yin* and *yang* collide,\nwhen the heavens and earth shift violently,\nthey produce fierce winds and sudden rains—\nyet these cannot last even half a day,\nhow much less can humanity dwell between the heavens and earth,\nlike a single hair upon a horse’s body?\n\nHow dare one indulge desires and surrender to joy and anger,\nreckless and abrupt without restraint,\nrushing toward swift ruin?\n\nThis is not the Dao.\n\nThose who follow the Dao align with the Dao;\nthose who embody virtue align with virtue;\nthose who stray align with loss.\n\n*From* (从) means to act in accordance,\nto follow naturally.\n\nThe Dao is the natural, boundless,\ntranquil, simple, and effortless Way.\n\nWhen humans act, they should align with the Dao,\nrestrain their words and desires,\nand preserve the harmony of heaven—\nhow could they be like fierce winds and sudden rains,\nonly to vanish soon?\n\nYet those who follow the Dao:\nin motion, they ride the waves of *yang*;\nin stillness, they rest in the virtue of *yin*,\ngathering to form substance,\nscattering to become *qi*—\nemerging without return,\nthey walk the Way of subtlety.\n\nThose who embody virtue:\nwithin, they fulfill all their duties,\nnever losing their spirit,\nwithout;\nthey benefit all things,\nextending kindness even to weeds and grasses,\ncompleting deeds without claiming credit,\nand thus align with the highest virtue.\n\nThose who stray:\ntake pleasure in gluttony and greed,\nconsider bonds and servitude as honor,\ntoil like beasts without remorse,\nand gladly court ruin—\nthey align with loss.\n\nThose who align with the Dao,\nthe Dao will find them.\nThose who align with virtue,\nvirtue will find them.\nThose who align with loss,\nloss will find them.\n\n*\"Faith is insufficient—\nthere is also unfaith.\"*\n\nThis speaks of how *qi* of like nature responds to one another.\n\nThose who embody the Dao in their being—\nnot only do they bring joy to the people,\nbut the sovereign of the Great Dao also finds his match.\n\nThose whose deeds align with the highest virtue—\nnot only do the people revere them,\nbut the sages of supreme virtue also find their match.\n\nThose whose hearts are lost in ruin—\nnot only do they rejoice in their decaying bodies,\nbut the ranks of the lost also find their match.\n\nEach responds in kind.\n\nThus, those who trust in the Dao\nfind their Dao.\nThose who trust in virtue\nfind their virtue.\nIf one does not trust in the Dao,\nor scorns virtue,\nthen the Dao will not respond,\nand virtue will be unattained.\n\nWho in the world truly trusts in this?\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"Faith is insufficient—\nthere is also unfaith.\"*\n\nFew words and sparse speech align with nature and the Dao,\nvirtue and the Way blend harmoniously without arrogance or boasting—\nthus, those who follow are not established.\n\nThe boastful do not stand,\nthe presumptuous do not walk.\n\nBoastful—\nthey rise on their toes to gaze,\nthen press forward in vain.\nPresumptuous—\nthey grasp at things,\nor leap over others in contempt.\n\nThe gluttonous and aggressive,\nwho lift their gaze beyond measure,\nseeking favor and glory—\nthough they may briefly attain it,\nit is like stretching their necks and rising on their toes—\nhow could they stand long?\n\nYet they lack true talent and ability,\nyet they dare to surpass others—\nthe crowd blocks their path,\nso they cannot speak.\nTheir strides are forced, grasping at things,\ntheir hearts longing for swift success—\nhow could they ever walk?\n\nThe self-praised are not enlightened,\nthe self-righteous do not shine,\nthe self-glorified have no merit,\nthe self-proud do not endure.\n\n*\"The crooked becomes whole—\nChapter Twenty-Two—*\nthe Sage acts without doing,\ndoes not boast or glory,\nyet never fails to be manifest.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the petty man—\nhe is not so.\n\nHe flaunts his own talents,\nobscuring others—\nhow could his deeds be clear?\n\nHe is right in his own eyes,\nyet wrongs others—\nhe praises himself,\nyet blames others—\nhow could his principles be revealed?\n\nHis benevolence does not extend to all,\nhis righteousness does not judge wrongs—\nhe takes credit for himself,\nseeking glory—\nhow could his governance be effective?\n\nHe boasts of his great abilities,\noppressing the weak and foolish—\nhow could he walk the Dao long?\n\nOf the Dao it is said:\n*\"Excessive food and superfluous actions—\nmen may detest them,\nyet the Dao does not dwell there.\"*\n\nThese are like blemishes and deformities upon the body.\n\nThe actions of self-glorying and the like—\nto the Dao of natural effortlessness,\nthey are like discarded food,\nfit only to offend,\nor like deformities,\nfit only to disgrace.\n\nAll things detest them,\nhow much more would the Dao’s worthy\never place themselves there?\n\nBoasting, presumption, and superfluous actions—\nthe Dao does not dwell there,\ntheir traces blend into obscurity—\nthus, it follows with *\"things blend into obscurity.\"*\n\nThings blend into obscurity,\nexisting before the heavens and earth.\n\nThose who blend into obscurity—\nthey are the origin of the Dao.\n\nThus, they cannot be seen,\ncannot be heard,\ncannot be grasped.\n\nThe highest principle is profound and ever-present,\nthus called *\"things blend into obscurity.\"*\n\nThe true Dao flows in myriad paths yet is undivided,\nthus called *\"obscurity without end.\"*\n\nYet obscurity without end cannot be known,\nyet all things arise from it—\nthus it is said: *\"things blend into obscurity.\"*\n\nExisting before the heavens and earth—\nthis is the source of the Dao.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"I do not know whose child is this,\nwho shaped the Emperor before his birth.\"*\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"The Dao precedes the Great Pole,\nyet is not high.\nIt lies beneath the Six Poles,\nyet is not deep.\nIt exists before the heavens and earth,\nyet is not long-lived.\nIt endures through the ancient past,\nyet is not old—\nthese mark the Dao’s grand essence.\n\nSilent and boundless,\nit stands alone yet never changes,\ncirculates endlessly yet never falters—\nit may be called the Mother of the world.\n\nSilent—\nno sound.\nBoundless—\nno form.\n\nThough it is said *\"things blend into obscurity,\"*\nseeking its form and voice,\nit is like an open window into true emptiness—\nno image, no substance—\nthus it is called *\"silent and boundless.\"*\n\nThe Great Mass stands solitary,\nno thing to compare with.\nEven form and shadow depend on something else,\nyet it is said to transform alone—\nhow much more the subtle Dao,\nvast and clear—\nwhat thing could pair with it?\n\nThus it stands alone.»\n\nThe myriad things though ever-changing, born and dying,\nyet the subtle Dao never shifts or alters—\nthus it is said, *\"never changes.\"*\n\nMoreover, the Dao’s workings:\nwhen dispersed, the harmonizing *qi* is confined within the Great Void,\nwhen gathered, the pure essence is stored like grains in a granary.\nCirculating through the Six Empties,\nits applications are boundless—\nthus it is said, *\"never falters.\"*\n\nNo thing, great or small,\ndoes not rely upon the Dao.\nTo obtain it is to be whole,\nto depart from it is to perish.\nIt gives birth and completes all things—\nall depend upon it—\nthus it is called *\"the Mother of the world.\"*\n\nI know not its name,\nso I call it *Dao*.\nForced to name it, I say *Great*.\n\nThe Great Dao is formless,\nso no ear can hear it,\nno hand can grasp it.\nSince it lacks form, sound, or trace,\nits name is unknown.\n\nYet earlier it was said, *\"things blend into obscurity,\"*\nso it has *body* and *use*.\nOnce body and use are revealed,\nit gives rise to all things.\nExamining its use reveals its *virtue*,\nso it is named *Dao*.\nIt encompasses heaven and earth—\nits substance is supremely vast—\nthus, forced to name it, I say *Great*.\n\nGreat is called *Passing*,\nPassing is called *Distant*,\nDistant is called *Returning*.\nPassing—this is *going*.\nAll great things have boundaries,\nyet the Dao is boundless.\n\nWithout limit it goes,\nwithout shore it extends—\nthus Great is called *Passing*.\nThe farther it passes, the more distant it grows,\nits source cannot be traced—\nthus Passing is called *Distant*.\nThough distant beyond the Eight Wastes,\nit returns to stillness within the inch of the heart,\nlike a mirror’s clarity—\nresponding without storing—\nthus Distant is called *Returning*.\nReturning—this is *restoration*.\nTo go and return,\nto perish and revive,\nfrom yin to yang—\nall are the Dao’s transformations.\n\nThus the Dao is Great,\nheaven is Great,\nearth is Great,\nand the Sage-King is also Great.\nWithin the *domain*, there are Four Greats,\nand the Sage-King occupies one.\n\nThe Dao is the origin of heaven and earth,\nvast and boundless, encompassing all.\nAll things obtain it and live;\nthe people cherish it and honor it—\nthus the Dao is Great.\n\nHeaven is inverted above,\nmoving without rest,\ncovering all things endlessly—\nthus heaven is Great.\n\nEarth is congealed below,\nstill and unmoving,\nyielding and tranquil,\nthickly bearing all things endlessly—\nthus earth is Great.\n\nThe Sage-King is serene and does nothing,\nhis transformations reach all things,\nthe leader of the black-haired masses—\nhe does not dare compare himself to heaven, earth, or the Dao—\nthus he is also Great.\n\nThe Four Greats within the *domain* are:\nthe Dao, heaven, earth, and the Sage-King.\n*Domain*—this is *limit*.\n\nThe Dao encompasses the cosmos,\npenetrates the finest hair,\nsometimes transcends form,\nsometimes dwells within limits.\nFrom earth upward, all belong to heaven—\nnot the lofty, distant blue.\n\nHeaven is beyond earth,\nearth is within heaven.\nThe Sage-King, honored among humanity,\ndwells between the Nine Regions—\nall within the *domain*.\n\nThus the Four Greats within the *domain*.\nThe Sage-King follows the Dao of heaven and earth,\nholds the authority over all things,\nand among the Four Greats,\nhe shares in one.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"None are more divine than heaven,\nnone are more abundant than earth,\nnone are greater than the Emperor-King.\nThe Emperor-King’s virtue aligns with heaven and earth—\nhow could he be careless?\"*\n\nHumanity follows earth,\nearth follows heaven,\nheaven follows the Dao,\nthe Dao follows *naturalness*.\n\nThis admonishes the Sage-King:\nto model the Two Poles,\ntake the Dao as his standard,\nand the world will naturally be governed.\n\nThe Sage-King, guarding *yin*-like stillness,\nbears all without partiality—\nthis follows earth.\nYet he must not cling to earth’s immutability.\nWhen he moves with *yang*-like vigor,\nhis rule is impartial—\nthis follows heaven.\nYet he must not fixate on heaven’s unchanging course.\nInstead, he follows *wuwei*,\naligning with the Dao’s substance,\nletting all things return to their nature—\nthis is the Sage-King following heaven and earth as the Dao.\n\nIt is not that heaven, earth, and the Dao model each other,\nbut one should discern the profound intent of the Sage’s teachings—\nnot merely engaging in empty words.\n\nThe *mixed-and-formed* Dao—\nthis is called *strong naming*.\nStrongly naming the Four Greats,\nthe Sage-King occupies one.\nThe Sage-King, with heavy things governing light,\nthus places the heavy as the root of the light.\n\nHeavy is the root of light,\nstillness is the lord of agitation.\n\nGrasses and trees—\ntheir petals and leaves are light and fragile,\nperched on branches—\nthey wither under wind and frost.\nBut their roots are firm and heavy,\ndeep below—\nnothing can harm them, and they endure.\n\nLikewise, governing the body and the state,\none must take substance and weight as the foundation.\n\nDragons and serpents,\ncoiled and submerged in stillness,\ncan transform and ascend.\nTigers and leopards,\nmenacing and restless,\nare felled by arrows and die young.\nThus, for governing the body,\na tranquil heart brings harmony to all spirits—\nno cravings or agitation will harm it.\nFor governing the state,\na ruler who does nothing brings the people joy and ease—\nno scheming ministers will cause chaos.\n\nThus the noble person walks all day\nwithout leaving his *zhi* and *zhòng*.\n*Zhi*—a screen-car, also a heavy wagon.\n*Zhòng*—this is *weight* in his conduct.\n\nThe perfect person and noble never speak or act lightly.\nWhatever they do, they carry their *zhi* and *zhòng*.\nTheir words must weigh upon matters.\nIf their words and deeds are thus,\nhow much more the Dao—\nwould they dare for an instant depart from it?\n\nSome interpret *zhi* as *stillness*,\nalso warning of stillness and weight.\n\nMoreover, those who travel far\nnever abandon their *zhi* and heavy loads—\nfor their clothing and food depend upon them.\nIf they depart and discard them,\nthey risk exhaustion upon the road.\n\nLikewise, the noble person,\nif he abandons the Dao’s weight and stillness\nto act lightly and agitated—\nwhat greater calamity could there be?\n\nThough adorned with splendor,\nhe remains serene and detached.\n*Splendor*—the appearance of bustling adornment.\n*Serene*—this is *ease*.\nThe perfect person and noble,\never fearful in their hearts,\ndo not take ornate splendor as beauty.\nThey do not indulge in ease and comfort,\nbut remain detached and distant,\nabandoning arrogance and excess—\nthis too is the essence of guarding weight and stillness.\n\nSome texts read *honor-hall* or *feast-assembly*,\nmeaning they do not delight in halls of splendor,\nbut find ease in modest dwellings,\nand remain detached and distant.\n\nAlas, how could the ruler of a great realm—\nthe sovereign of ten thousand chariots—\nlightly cast his own weight upon the world?\nLightness leads to losing one’s foundation,\nagitation leads to losing one’s sovereignty.\n\n*\"Alas\"*—this is the language of lament.\nFor the sovereign of ten thousand chariots,\nholding the grandest treasure of rule,\nhow could he not guard weight and stillness,\nbut lightly abandon his body to reckless desires?\n\nIf a subject fails to be steadfast and weighty,\nhe loses his own foundation\nand forfeits his proper duties.\n\nThe ancient text reads:\n*\"Lightness leads to losing one’s foundation,\"*\nand if the ruler does not uphold the Way of non-action and serene stillness,\nbut stirs and disturbs the people,\nthen he loses his sovereign position\nand forfeits the harmony of Heaven.\n\nThe old saying goes:\n*\"If the ruler acts lightly and carelessly, troubling the people,*\n*then the people scatter—who would remain as his subjects?\"*\n\nIf subjects disguise themselves with deceit to seek wealth,\nact agitated to gain power and influence,\nthey invite exile and ruin,\nand cannot serve their ruler.\n\nBoth meanings are valid.\n\nThe method of guarding weight and stillness\nis only practiced well by the noble person,\nso it follows with *\"the noble person’s actions leave no trace.\"*\n\n*\"Noble actions\"*—no tracks or edges.\n*\"Noble speech\"*—no flaws or censure.\n*\"Noble calculation\"*—no need for schemes or strategies.\n*\"Noble closure\"*—no doors or bolts yet cannot be opened.\n*\"Noble binding\"*—no ropes or knots yet cannot be undone.\n*\"Noble actions\"*—this means acting in accordance with nature.\n\nThe *Yin-Fu Jing* says:\n*\"To observe the Dao of Heaven, one must follow Heaven’s actions,\"*\nmeaning to observe the natural Way,\nwhich is the original observation.\nTo follow nature’s actions,\none must hold nothing in hand.\nIf one holds nothing in observation or action,\nthis is obtained from the heart,\nso even without stepping outside the door,\nthere are no tracks or disturbances.\n\n*\"Noble speech\"* is like Zhuangzi’s cup-speech—\nwords drawn from the center,\never-renewing variations,\nin harmony with nature,\nwithout exceeding the proper boundaries.\nThus, there are no flaws or censures.\n\n*\"Noble calculation\"* means\nto guard the One and do nothing,\nto follow the natural course of all things,\nallowing their long and short,\nbroad and narrow,\ngreat and small,\nmany and few\nto each fulfill their proper measure,\nwithout harming their natural forms and capacities.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The One and speech become two,\ntwo and the One become three—*\n*from this point onward,*\n*even clever schemers cannot grasp it,*\n*how much less the ordinary?\"*\n\nThis is why the noble person\nrejects schemes and strategies.\nThe *Yin-Fu Jing* says:\n*\"The eight trigrams, the Heavenly Stems, the Earthly Branches—\ndivine schemes and occult concealments—\nthe interplay of yin and yang in victory and defeat,*\n*clearly advance into the realm of symbols.*\n*All this belongs to the study of contrived actions and clever stratagems.\"*\n\nThe perfect person wanders in the initial realm of things,\nallows all things to govern themselves without being enslaved by them,\nand calculates only his own body—\nthus knowing the other.\nHence, he has no need for schemes or strategies.\n\n*\"Noble closure\"* means the heart’s non-action.\nThe one whose heart does not act,\nthough sounds and colors may be before him,\nall such phenomena do not enter his ears or eyes—\nthis is why no doors or bolts are needed,\nyet nothing can open it.\n\n*\"Horizontal\"* is called *guān*,\n*\"vertical\"* is called *zhàng*.\n\n*\"Noble binding\"* means\nto bind affairs with the Dao.\nThe perfect person is simple and effortless,\nskilled at restraining greed and excess with the Dao,\nnaturally binding emotions and desires,\nwhile maintaining serene stillness without strain.\nThus, he has no need for explanation.\n\nTherefore, the sage is always good at saving people,\nso he does not abandon people,\nand always good at saving things,\nso he does not abandon things—\nthis is called *\"clinging to clarity.\"*\n\n*\"Clinging\"* means *secretly applying*.\nThe sage refers to those who practice the Five Noble Virtues.\n\nThe sage harmonizes with nature,\nhis heart merges with the utmost One,\nso he can treat all things—\neven the humble and lowly—\nas if they were sacred offerings,\nand assign the wise and foolish to their proper roles,\nallowing people’s nature to remain whole\nand their forms complete,\neach fulfilling their proper function—\nthus, he does not abandon people.\n\nFurthermore, he follows their growth and decline,\nrespects their capacities and endowments,\nensuring that square and round,\nstraight and crooked\ndo not harm Heaven’s principles.\nEven to the lowliest tiles and boards,\neveryone has their place—\nthus, he does not abandon things.\n\n*\"Always good\"* means\nto nurture the constant Dao\nwhile clearly discerning and following the natural course of things.\n\nThe *Hong Lie Jie* says:\n*\"In the past, when Gongsun Long was in Zhao,*\n*he told his disciples:*\n*'If a man has no ability,*\n*I cannot consort with him.'*\n*A traveler in coarse clothing and simple belt came to see him,*\n*and said:*\n*'I can shout.'*\n*Gongsun Long turned to his disciples and said:*\n*'Among your ranks, is there one who can shout?*\n*They replied:*\n*'No.'*\n*Gongsun Long said:*\n*'Enroll him as a disciple.'*\n*After several days,*\n*the man went to speak with the king,*\n*and when he reached the riverbank,*\n*he was crossing in a boat,*\n*and the traveler shouted once,*\n*and the boat came to him.*\n*Thus, the sage’s way in the world*\n*does not oppose those with extraordinary abilities,*\n*so it is said:*\n*'He does not abandon people.'*\n*Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the ungood,*\n*and the ungood person is the resource of the good.*\n*The good person refers to those with the Dao.*\n\n*The Classic says:*\n*'Establish the Son of Heaven,*\n*set the Three Exalted Ministers—*\n*this is to teach the ungood.'*\n*Thus, it is said:*\n*'The good person is the teacher of the ungood.'*\n*Even if there are ungood people,*\n*the good person also uses and employs them,*\n*gradually transforming and guiding them.*\n\n*The Classic says:*\n*'The good, I make them good.*\n*The ungood, I also make them good,*\n*and thus they become good.*\n*The faithful, I believe them.*\n*The unfaithful, I also believe them,*\n*and thus they become faithful.'*\n*This is to transform and subdue the ungood through virtue and power,*\n*to use them as resources and tools.*\n\n*The Hong Lie Jie says:*\n*'The Chu general Zi Fa*\n*loved to seek out those with martial skills.*\n*There was a man in Chu skilled at theft,*\n*who came to see him and said:*\n*'I have heard that you seek those with martial skills.*\n*I am a thief,*\n*and I wish to use my skill to spare one soldier for you.'*\n*Zi Fa, upon hearing this,*\n*did not bother to adjust his clothes or straighten his cap,*\n*but rushed out to greet and honor him.*\n*His attendants remonstrated:*\n*'A thief is the greatest bandit in the world—*\n*why honor him?*\n*The general replied:*\n*'This is not something you can understand.'*\n*Soon after,*\n*Ami’s army rose,*\n*attacking Chu,*\n*and Zi Fa led his troops to meet them.*\n*The enemy forces repelled his three times.*\n*The worthy and virtuous ministers of Chu*\n*all exhausted their schemes and sincerity,*\n*yet the Ami army grew stronger.*\n*Then the thief came forward and said:*\n*'I have a small skill.*\n*I wish to use it for you.'*\n*Zi Fa replied:*\n*'Agreed.'*\n*He did not question his words*\n*but sent him away.\"*\n\nThe thief then secretly untied the general of Qi’s tent at night and presented it to him. Zi Fa had someone return it, saying: *\"A soldier was gathering firewood and found the general’s canopy. I had him return it to the proper authorities.\"*\n\nThe next day, he went again and took the general’s hairpin. Zi Fa once more had it returned.\n\nWhen the Qi army heard of this, they were greatly alarmed. The general and his officers conferred: *\"If we do not leave today, the Chu army may take our heads.\"* Thus, they withdrew their forces.\n\nA skill may be slight, yet its use profound—it lies in how the ruler employs it. If one does not honor his teacher nor cherish his resources, though he may know the great confusion, this is called the supreme subtlety.\n\nThough the Sage may wander in the realm of self-realization, he cannot neglect his teacher and resources. Yet even when establishing them, he fears overvaluing his teacher or clinging to his resources, becoming mired in old traces and failing to reach the farthest heights. Hence, he repeatedly emphasizes: *\"Do not honor your teacher, do not cherish your resources.\"*\n\nThough a man relies on his teacher to awaken his initial understanding, he seeks the ultimate truth, which arises from his innate nature—this is the day of true transformation. Thus, the horse expert cannot transform a poor steed into a fine one, nor can a skilled artisan carve inferior wood into beams. Only when one forgets all aspiration can he attain the Dao’s ultimate.\n\nHence, Liezi, having learned from Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gao, later said: *\"I do not know whether my teacher and friend were truly my teacher and friend—this is the true forgetting of teacher and resource.\"*\n\nThough the Sage knows the petty man is rigid and his teachings may seem misleading, he still instructs the superior man, urging both to forget, and thus speaks of the supreme subtlety.\n\nGood deeds and good words are what save people and things. To be a teacher or resource is to know softness and hardness.\n\nThus, next comes knowing the雄 (*xiong*—masculine, strong, preeminent). Knowing the雄, guarding the雌 (*ci*—feminine, yielding, retreat), makes one the valley of the world.\n\nTo be the valley of the world is to preserve one’s virtue unchanging, returning to the infant.\n\nThe雄 is exalted strength, precedence. The雌 is humility, weakness, retreat. To know one’s own exaltation, to stand out before others—if indulged, it breeds arrogance and invites calamity. Instead, one must dwell in humility, guard softness and weakness, be modest and retreat, and the world will submit, as water flows into deep valleys. When one’s heart and mind are like a valley, one preserves virtue unchanging, abandons harsh desires, and returns to the innocence of infancy.\n\nInfancy is the pure, unadulterated harmony where distinctions of right and wrong are extinguished.\n\nKnowing the white, guarding the black, makes one the model of the world. To be the model of the world is to preserve virtue without excess, returning to the boundless.\n\nThe man of the Dao, whose heart and mind are like a valley, generates clarity in emptiness—bright and distinct—yet he guards his depth and silence, holding himself in obscurity, making his light shine without dazzling. This can be the model for the world.\n\nThose who take him as their model see his virtue without excess, aligning with the Dao’s true essence.\n\nKnowing honor, guarding humiliation, makes one the valley of the world. To be the valley of the world is to make virtue complete, returning to simplicity.\n\nThough the man of the Dao may be taken as a model, he must guard humiliation, hold victory in self-effacement, and let the world’s heart turn to him, as water flows into valleys. His capacity is like a valley—virtue is full yet nameless, returning to the Dao’s simplicity. Simplicity means concealing talent and hiding use.\n\nWhen simplicity disperses, it becomes an instrument. The Sage uses it as an official, thus the great order is not violated.\n\nReturning to the Dao’s simplicity means merging into the boundless, where vision and hearing find no grasp—this is the body’s attainment of true reality. Yet in governing, one must disperse and become an instrument.\n\nRiver Master said: *\"When the simplicity of all things disperses, it becomes an instrument. Used according to the Dao, it becomes divine clarity, flowing as the sun and moon, dividing into the Five Phases.\"*\n\nWhen a man’s true heart disperses, it becomes thought and deliberation. A single movement of thought brings forth myriad actions and all affairs. Affairs are coarse instruments.\n\nThe Sage takes their talents and abilities, appointing them as leaders of the hundred officials, thus able to govern all things naturally without harm.\n\nLu Xi Sheng said: *\"Ah, the great Dao! It abandons benevolence and righteousness. When simplicity disperses into instruments, the Sage uses them, thus able to lead the myriad coarse things. The great Dao is not an instrument, yet it uses these instruments. The great order is not violated, yet it governs all things. If one is not merged in the Dao yet seeks to use the world’s instruments, constrained by things and attempting to govern the world’s talents, I must see his ruin.\"*\n\nKnowing the雄, guarding the雌, practicing virtue like a valley yielding downward. Knowing the white, guarding the black, obscuring oneself as the world’s model.\n\nWhen the model is applied, one may wish to take the world. Yet to take the world by force—*I see it as inevitable failure.*\n\nThe Dao acts without action, naturally. Even the slightest matter follows it, let alone the world. If one does not follow its natural course but relies on boldness, seeking to forcibly take the world’s great instrument and indulge in artificial action, not only will he lose the Dao—I must see him perish.\n\n*\"Perish\"* means *\"die.\"*\n\nThe world’s divine instrument cannot be forced. To force it is to ruin it; to grasp it is to lose it. The divine instrument is the supreme position of heaven and earth, the divine clarity of the cosmos. Man is the divine thing of the world.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"I have heard of nurturing the world, not governing it.\"* *\"Nurturing\"* means fearing the world will corrupt its nature. *\"Governing\"* means fearing the world will stray from its virtue.\n\nThe world does not corrupt its nature nor stray from its virtue—how then could there be one who governs it? This is called *not* governing the world.\n\nNot governing the world means following the natural course without action, letting things unfold spontaneously, so that the world is at peace and the divine things are tranquil.\n\nIf one does not follow the natural course without action but instead acts, it is like a clumsy woodcutter—though he applies his skill, he ruins more than he accomplishes. Thus, when the seven orifices were pierced, Pangu died; when the horse was whipped and urged, its strength was exhausted. Is this not the case where action brings ruin?\n\nAnd yet, if one clings stubbornly and refuses to yield, claiming to be a sage of governance, not only does one lose the ultimate truth, but one will also lose one’s own authenticity.\n\nThus, things may prosper or decline, be molded or shattered, be strong or weak, bear loads or collapse. These eight outcomes prove that external things cannot be relied upon.\n\nIn the world, some act with sincere intent, while others follow with insincere motives. Sincerity brings order, insincerity brings chaos. Order arises naturally, while chaos demands action.\n\nSome praise with warmth—those who extol and perfect the virtues of others—or criticize with coldness—those who slander and expose the faults of others. Praise with warmth signifies wealth and nobility, while cold criticism signifies poverty and lowliness, just as spring and summer nurture while autumn and winter wither. The affairs of the world change and transform in this way.\n\nSome see strength and support it, others see weakness and suppress it. Some bolster the weak to make them strong, others oppress the strong to make them weak—these are the inclinations of human nature.\n\nSome bear burdens and make them stable, others topple them and make them precarious. From this point onward, all are deviations from nature, relying solely on artificial action and boldness, seeking to take and thus bringing about these flaws.\n\nTherefore, the sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids extravagance. Excess, extravagance, and extravagance are all transgressions beyond measure.\n\nThus, the sage who governs the world knows that calamity and blessing depend on each other, that blessing and calamity lie latent. Abandoning artificial action, returning to desirelessness, discarding extreme contrivance and returning to nature, abandoning luxurious adornment and returning to simplicity, abandoning excessive desires and returning to tranquility—though excess, extravagance, and extravagance are three distinct names, they are all facets of the unity of *wuwei* and naturalness. Through these excesses and extravagances, artificial action arises, which is why the Old Master issued profound warnings.\n\nIf one insists on forcing, ruin is inevitable. If one coerces the weak and strong, tilts the balance, indulges in extravagance and excess, it is better to assist the ruler with the Dao than to persist in such folly.\n\nThus, the *True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*—*Hidden Chamber of Reverence*—Chapter Four concludes.\nThe *True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*—*Compilation of Subtleties*—Chapter Five begins.\n\n「Bìxū Zǐ Chén Jǐngyuán compiled: *The Dao Scripture*—*On Using the Dao to Assist the Ruler*—states, *\"Do not use military force to coerce the world; such actions tend to rebound.\"* Here, *以* means *to employ*.\n\nThe virtuous minister, employing the Dao of naturalness, assists the sage ruler by first clarifying the *Heavenly Mandate* while *Dao and Virtue* follow, then *Dao and Virtue* illuminated, *benevolence and righteousness* follow, and so on—*benevolence and righteousness* clarified, *allocation and defense* follow; *allocation and defense* clarified, *form and name* follow; *form and name* clarified, *fitness and responsibility* follow; *fitness and responsibility* clarified, *self-reflection and restraint* follow; *self-reflection and restraint* clarified, *discrimination of right and wrong* follows; *discrimination of right and wrong* clarified, *rewards and punishments* follow. This is the method of using the Dao to assist the sage ruler.\n\nThus, one who holds the *Great Principle* (*dàxiàng*) will govern the world without harming its peace and stability. Military force is a cruel instrument, and warfare is a perilous affair—how can one display military strength to the world? The signs of war lie in the heart: harboring resentment before conflict is war, hasty speech and stern expressions are war, arrogant words and reckless challenges are war, indulging in battles and assaults is war. These four are the seeds of great and petty strife alike.\n\nMoreover, when humans oppress things violently, things will inevitably retaliate—this is called *\"beasts driven to desperation will strike.\"* Hence, it is said, *\"such actions tend to rebound.\"*\n\nWhere troops are stationed, thorns and brambles grow; after great armies pass, calamitous years follow. Where soldiers dwell, they bring destruction: they plunder the people, obstruct agriculture, leaving fields barren and homes exposed, thorns and brambles to flourish wildly. Furthermore, once great armies have passed, slaughter knows no bounds, and the grievances of life and death disrupt the harmonious *qi*, causing *yin-yang* disturbances—surely floods and droughts will follow.\n\nFor one who governs his own body and seeks to resolve his troubles, military campaigns become burdensome like troops, vexations like thorns, cravings like great armies, and illness like calamitous years. Following righteousness with reckless abandon, one cannot fathom its depths.\n\nThus, the wise act decisively yet without arrogance, never daring to employ force for coercion. Act decisively yet do not boast, act decisively yet do not glory in victory, act decisively yet do not be proud. This is called *good use*.\n\nThe harm of military force is something even the enlightened abhor. Yet, even the sagest of rulers never abandon it entirely, for its origins are noble and profound. Gēngsāng Zǐ said: *\"The roots of war lie in humanity’s very beginning.\"* Again, he said: *\"There are those who die from taking medicine, yet one cannot forbid all physicians in the world. There are those who die from boarding ships, yet one cannot forbid all ships in the world. There are those who lose their nations through war, yet one cannot forbid all military forces in the world.\"*\n\nWar cannot be abolished, like water and fire. Good use brings fortune, poor use brings calamity. Hence, anger and corporal punishment must not be indulged in the home, legal punishments must not be indulged in the state, and military campaigns must not be indulged in the world.\n\nThe sage rulers of antiquity had *righteous wars* yet no *indulged wars*. Therefore, one who uses the Dao to assist the ruler must uphold *feminine tranquility*, never daring to coerce the world with military force. When forced to respond, they do so with restraint—this is called *good use*.\n\nDecisive (*guǒ*) means *courageous*. Speaking of the good use of troops, it means courage in resolving crises, not daring to employ weapons to coerce the world. Though there is courage in resolving crises and repelling enemies, it must all be done without coercion.\n\nThings grow strong only to decline—this is called *not the Dao*. *Not the Dao* is early decay. Though one may act decisively to resolve crises and repel enemies, it is all done without coercion. Only violence for the sake of violence is to be avoided; decisive action must be for righteousness alone, not for the love of war.\n\nThe growth of grass and trees is soft and tender; when they reach their peak, they wither and fall. Human infancy is marked by softness and weakness; when one reaches his prime, he grows old and frail. This illustrates that military might and strength lead only to ruin—once ruined, one cannot claim to follow the Dao.\n\nUnrighteous acts cannot be emulated, and actions contrary to the Dao are better stopped early. Hence, *righteous wars* prevail, *responsive wars* succeed, *wrathful wars* perish, and *arrogant wars* are destroyed.\n\nThe good use of military force lies in decisive yet restrained action—without boasting, without wrath, without greed, without arrogance—responding only when forced, with righteousness in repelling enemies and saving people, not relying on strength or craving battle.\n\nGoverning one’s body and resolving troubles means: *\"The withering of a man is due to his failure to follow the Dao; failing to follow the Dao means early death.\"*\n\nTo assist the ruler, one must rely on *Dao and Virtue*, not on fine soldiers and military force. Thus, it proceeds to discuss *fine soldiers*.\n\nFine soldiers are instruments of ill omen, and things often loathe them. Hence, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them. *佳* (*jiā*) means *to favor* or *to esteem*. To favor and esteem weapons and armor as objects of luxury is to esteem what is not good.\n\nWeapons and armor, which harm the form and spirit of men, are only enjoyed by the cruel and obstinate. Even ordinary things may be loathed, how much more so by those who follow the Dao?\n\nThe gentleman values the left when at home, but the right when in war. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is such that the left is *yang*—generative, soft, and weak—while the right is *yin*—punitive, hard, and strong.\n\nThus, in times of peace, the gentleman esteems those of virtue to dwell on his left, but in times of war, he esteems the courageous to stand on his right.\n\nWeapons are instruments of ill omen, not for the gentleman. This is a reiteration to emphasize the point—*the Scripture explaining itself*.\n\nSince weapons are instruments of killing, of hardness and strength, and their purpose is to harm, they are indeed instruments of ill omen.\n\nThe gentleman takes *wuwei* and naturalness as his heart, and *Dao and Virtue*, *benevolence and righteousness* as his practice. Military force is only for defense and preparedness, not an instrument the gentleman habitually employs.\n\nWhen forced to use it, he does so with calm restraint. Barbarians and savages, bandits and deceitful thieves—these are the reasons why the gentleman, who follows the Dao, may be forced to use military force. Yet he never initiates war, so he does not dare to be the aggressor but only the defender, nor to advance an inch when he must retreat a foot—all these are done without coercion.\n\nRighteous wars are used to conquer and settle chaos, to respond to enemies—never for the sake of seizing land or treasure.»\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"When the market-seller Yi Liao of Shì Nán played with his ball and resolved the feud between the two families, and when Sun Shu Ao took his jade staff and feathered robe while the people of Ying cast down their weapons, this is what is called victory without battle—calm and tranquil is the highest. To resolve without disorder is called tranquil; to quiet the mind is called serene. When matters arise and one remains unmoved and unperturbed, this is the method for cultivating oneself.*\n\n*To win yet not take pleasure in it, but others do—this is one who delights in killing. He who delights in killing cannot achieve his will in the world. The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is *generation*; this is why all beings hold it in common esteem. Now, if one cannot win over others with virtue but instead raises armies, wages war, and seeks victory through slaughter, how can this be the conduct of one who follows the Dao?*\n\n*The *Lüzi* says: When Zhao Xiangzi sent his retainers to attack Zhi and won yet wore a worried expression, this was the conduct of a virtuous ruler holding victory—thus it is said, *‘to win yet not take pleasure in it.’* Yet if there are those who praise this, it is because they delight in killing. Those who delight in killing are not only shunned by others but will themselves be slain. These are the cruel and violent who love slaughter—such men must not be allowed to achieve their will in the world. If they do, they will surely defy Heaven’s virtue, unleash indiscriminate slaughter, and how could Heaven then aid them?\n\n*In auspicious rites, the left is honored; in funeral rites, the right is honored. The *Pianjiang* (Vanguard General) stands on the left, the *Shangjiang* (Commander-in-Chief) on the right—this is to treat them as in mourning rites. The left is *yang*, the principle of life, so in ordinary times the left is honored—this is auspicious. The right is *yin*, the principle of death, so in funeral rites the right is honored—this is inauspicious. The *Liji·Tan Gong* says: The Master stood with his disciples in a respectful bow, all facing right. The Master said: ‘Your eagerness to learn is admirable. As for me, I am mourning my sister.’ The disciples should then face left. The Commander-in-Chief, who has the power of life and death, stands on the right; the Vanguard General, who does not, stands on the left—this shows that the conduct of war follows the same principle as funeral rites. Now, if the Commander-in-Chief stands on the right, it is because he is treated as in mourning rites. When many are slain, one weeps in sorrow; when victorious, one is treated as in mourning rites. Truly, righteous war is waged only when there is no alternative. Victory brings many deaths, yet one does not take pleasure in it—thus one weeps in sorrow. The Commander-in-Chief stands on the right, for the right is the position of mourning—this is why.*\n\n*The military is an inauspicious instrument, to be used only when there is no alternative. The gentleman values it only as a secondary matter, placing *Dao* and its constant practice above all else. Thus it is said: *‘Dao is constant and nameless.’* Though crude and small, the uncarved block (*pu*) is not dared to be enslaved by the world. If lords and kings could guard it, all things would come of their own accord. The Dao, in its greatness, is not exhausted; in its smallness, it is not neglected. It encompasses all things, penetrating the minutest details. Empty within yet full without, it contains *yin* within *yang*—this is the Dao, not the Dao of names, nor the names of the Dao. Thus it is said: *‘Dao is constant and nameless.’*\n\n*Once nameless, it is not an instrument. Before instruments are manifest, it is called *pu*. The Dao is subtle and mysterious: unseen when viewed, unheard when listened to—this is called *small*. The world’s talents and tools have bright eyes to enslave sight, keen ears to enslave hearing, minds to enslave will, courage to enslave strength, eloquence to enslave speech, and skill to enslave action. All these named things are what the *wuwei* (non-acting) uses to govern. Only the nameless *pu* of the Dao cannot be enslaved by the world. If lords and kings could hold fast to the root of *wuwei*, vague yet present above, precious yet empty within, then external things could not burden their authenticity, desires could not deceive their spirit, and all things would come of their own accord. The four classes would have none who did not submit.*\n\n*When Heaven and Earth unite in *wuwei*, sweet dew descends. No one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed. Heaven’s *wuwei* causes *yin* qi to descend; Earth’s *wuwei* causes *yang* qi to rise. When both act in *wuwei*, harmonious qi and sweet dew descend, bringing auspicious omens—this is the way of lords and kings. Heaven and Earth’s virtue is harmonious and divine. The *Classic* says: *‘I act not, yet the people transform themselves; I do not praise, yet the people return to simplicity.’* This is to say that without command, things naturally follow and become balanced.*\n\n*At first, there was the Dao—nameless. Once named, one must know when to stop. Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril. The beginning was the Dao—nameless, the constant and nameless Dao. Named things are the instruments of all things. The Dao, at its beginning, was nameless, yet it could govern all named things—this is called *pu*. When dispersed, it becomes instruments; when the sage uses it, it becomes officials and rulers. Named instruments are all the possessions of the king. Once distinctions are established, ranks are set—none may transgress above or below. Thus one must know when to stop. To know when to stop is to know oneself—this is wisdom. To know oneself and others is enlightenment. How could there then be peril?*\n\n*The Master of Riverbank (Heshang Gong) wrote: *‘Heaven too will know it.’* This means that if one follows the Dao and practices virtue, Heaven too will recognize it. The analogy is that the Dao in the world is like streams and valleys to the rivers and seas. The Dao pervades the world without exclusion: above, it reaches the Celestial Capital and Purple Bureaus; below, it reaches the humble and lowly. To follow it brings prosperity; to defy it brings ruin. If lords and kings guard *wuwei* and tranquility, they will above attract harmonious qi and below win the people’s hearts. Root and branch will be in accord, and none will escape its blessings. This is like the flow of streams and valleys, which, when aligned with the rivers and seas, nourish all things, but when obstructed, become turbulent and turn to sand.*\n\n*To guard the Dao is to have all things submit of their own accord. To know oneself and others is wisdom.*\n\n「To discern others is called wisdom, hence knowing speech is how one discerns others—this is the wisdom of adapting to people, yet not knowing oneself. To know oneself and hold fast in silence is called clarity, hence knowing without speaking is how one knows Heaven—this is the self-adaptation of clarity alone, which transcends wisdom.\n\nTo overcome others is to have strength; to overcome oneself is to be mighty. To overcome others is not the Dao of enduring victory. The Dao of enduring victory is called might. Might, though strong and forceful, when encountering one who surpasses it, will falter. But to overcome oneself is the Dao of constant victory. The Dao of constant victory is called yielding. Yielding can humble itself, and things will naturally defer to it—this is called not overcoming yet overcoming oneself, not assuming burdens yet bearing them. It is ever serene and never falters; what else could be called might?\n\nTo know contentment is to be wealthy; to persist in strong conduct is to have resolve. To know contentment means to curb one’s desires. When desire does not indulge in excess, frugality suffices, and this may be called wealth. To persist in strong conduct means to exert oneself diligently. Diligence in action will surely succeed, and this may be called having resolve.\n\nMaster Zhuangzi said: Master Zeng lived in Wei, his patched robe without lining, his face swollen and his voice hoarse, his hands and feet calloused. For three days he did not light a fire, and for ten years he did not make new clothes. His crown was upright but its ribbon frayed, his collar was grasped yet his elbows exposed, his shoes were worn but their heels stacked, and as he pulled his belt he sang the *Shang* hymns, his voice filling the heavens and earth, as if issuing from metal and stone. The Son of Heaven could not find a subject like him, nor any lord a friend. Thus, those who cultivate resolve forget form, those who cultivate form forget profit, and those who perfect the Dao forget the self.\n\nThis is what is meant by knowing contentment is to be wealthy, and persisting in strong conduct is to have resolve. To never lose one’s place is to endure; to die yet not perish is longevity. *Place* refers to Heaven’s bestowal of life and death, adversity and fortune, nobility and humility, poverty and wealth. To preserve its natural order and accept it as one’s fate, without letting gain or loss unsettle the heart—this is how one endures. Thus, when alive, one does not take life as joy, knowing its inevitable course; when facing death, one does not take death as sorrow, knowing its inevitable return. To follow one’s fate in uprightness and wait for its end, without harming life through self-destruction—this is called longevity.\n\nMaster Yan Junping said: Not knowing others means one cannot navigate affairs; not navigating affairs means one cannot engage with the world. Not knowing oneself means one cannot know Heaven; not knowing Heaven means one cannot foresee what has not yet come to pass. Not overcoming others means one cannot stand above; not standing above means one cannot rule. Not overcoming oneself means one cannot attain self-mastery; not attaining self-mastery means one cannot win others. Not knowing contentment means one cannot grasp wealth; not grasping wealth means one cannot curb desire. Not persisting in strong conduct means one cannot align with the Dao; not aligning with the Dao means one cannot find harmony. Without harmony, one cannot endure in life; not enduring in life means one cannot nurture the spirit. When the spirit is not cultivated, one cannot attain longevity.\n\nTherefore, to establish oneself in the world and benefit others while removing harm, to interact with people and adapt to change—nothing is broader than knowledge. To gather one’s intelligence and cultivate clarity, to found a state and govern its people, to realize the intent of the Dao and the mind of Heaven—nothing is greater than self-knowledge. To wield authority and govern the people, to establish laws and rites, to set forth transformations and issue commands, to rectify the ministers of the land and the lords of the states—nothing is more noble than overcoming others. To uphold virtue and morality, to align with the divine and luminous, to receive from Heaven and Earth, to harmonize yin and yang, to act or rest with measured advance and retreat—nothing is more exalted than overcoming oneself.\n\nTo govern one’s household and preserve the state, to bring the people ease and joy, to dwell in harmony with reverence and caution, to practice kindness and filial piety while fearing the law—nothing is higher than knowing contentment. To wander freely in the divine and luminous, to be tranquil and at peace, to be honored and adorned—nothing is better than finding harmony.\n\nTo serve in office and fulfill duties, to attend to superiors and oversee inferiors, to complete others’ undertakings and continue their legacies, to extend these to all the people—nothing surpasses what is enduring. What Heaven and Earth value, what all creatures depend upon, to dwell in without ever tiring, to rejoice in without ever ceasing, where all blessings flourish and none can rival its splendor—this is called longevity.\n\nMaster Lu Xisheng said: Knowledge that comes from without is called wisdom, like the external radiance of the sun and fire. Knowledge that returns within is called clarity, like the internal reflection of gold and water. To use yielding strength to overcome others’ violence is the force of the Daoist Way; to uphold yielding to overcome one’s own restlessness is the might of virtue. To know contentment in matters of profit and desire is to not lose one’s great undertaking, hence it is called wealth and might.\n\nTo practice benevolence and righteousness is to reach eminent virtue, hence it is called having resolve. To act without ever losing one’s place is to endure; to die yet the Dao not perish—this is called longevity. To know others is to overcome others; to know oneself is to know Heaven. To never lose one’s place and to die yet not perish, drifting freely without attachment, attaining the Dao—this is why it is followed by the great hymn: *\"The great Dao drifts, drifting, its left and right unbound.\"* The great Dao drifts, drifting—without clinging or attachment. The Dao is supremely high without equal, supremely deep without bottom. It is level as a carpenter’s plumb and straight as a mason’s line, round as a compass and square as a ruler. It encompasses the universe without exterior, and penetrates all things without limit. It drifts, drifts, filling the boundless expanse, yet without clinging or attachment—this is the very body of the Dao. Whether it manifests on the left or the right, all things meet their source, and none escape its reach—this is the very use of the Dao. All things rely upon it for life yet it does not decline; its work is done yet it claims no credit. To rely means to depend. Heaven depends on the Dao’s yang-qi to move and turn above, Earth depends on the Dao’s yin-qi to rest and settle below. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they still depend on the Dao for its function. How much more so the myriad things, which all arise from it! Moreover, the great Dao is without sentiment, giving birth to Heaven and Earth; how could it ever refuse to labor for the myriad things? Yet again, the great Dao is without form, shaping the world without material; though all things have names of reliance and dependence, when tracing their origins...」\n\n「Lofty and singularly transformative, the Dao gives rise to things as they change and yet remains self-generated—thus leaving no trace of reliance or repayment. The Sage’s accomplishments are complete yet he does not claim them as his own; this is the very use of the Dao/Way.\n\nHe nurtures the myriad things yet does not lord over them, ever without desire, and thus may be called *virtue/power* in its small aspect. The Dao can cover and nourish all beings, yet it does not expect their gratitude in return. Hence, the Sage cultivates benevolence and love to sustain all classes of beings, allowing each to fulfill its nature and grow without restraint. The *Sutra/Scripture* says: *\"Ever without desire, one beholds its subtlety; subtlety allows entry into all things, and thus one may name the Dao’s simplicity as small.\"* One variant reads: *\"The Dao clothes and covers all things\"*—here, *clothes and covers* means *cover and nourish*.\n\nWhen all things return to it yet it does not claim lordship, this may be called *virtue/power* in its great aspect. The Dao covers and sustains all things, encompassing them without exclusion; all things return to it yet it remains undifferentiated, undifferentiated yet not claiming lordship. Zhuangzi says: *\"Undifferentiated yet encompassing all things—this is what is called great. Greatness contains all things, and thus the Dao may be called great.\"* Therefore, the Sage never claims to be great, and thus he achieves true greatness. The Sage holds to the Dao, humbly calling himself *孤 (Gū, solitary)*, *寡 (guǎ, few)*, and *不谷 (bùgǔ, not plentiful)*, demonstrating his refusal to claim greatness.\n\nAll nations return to him, yet his joy in promoting them never wanes—this is how he achieves true greatness. Du Guangting says: *\"The Sage loves the people and relieves the suffering of all things, extending his virtue to great and small alike—this may be called small virtue/power.\"* Yet, he allows all things to follow their nature and attributes his achievements to Heaven—this may also be called great virtue/power.\n\nThe Dao/Way applies its transformations, dispenses its virtue to humanity, and stirs the pure and harmonious winds, while clothing the world with its clear and tranquil governance. Forgetting his own deeds, not exalting himself above others, his grand achievements may be called great, and his virtue may endure forever—because he does not claim greatness, he attains this very eminence.\n\nThose who cultivate their personal conduct are expansive and unconfined, like clouds without form or water without vessel. They may turn left or right, adapt to every shape and direction, yet remain unconstrained by fixed norms. When things come, they respond; when they reflect, they broaden. They do not boast of their responsive and expansive nature, though their benefits to all things are manifold. Benevolence extends even to the lowliest creatures, yet he never makes it his own. All good deeds converge in harmony, yet he does not claim them as his own.\n\nThus, he manifests the virtue/power that is neither small nor great, bearing no name of self-exaltation or self-denigration, and may be said to align with the complete and true Dao.\n\nThe great Dao is vast and boundless, yet left or right, all things meet its source. When all things return to it, this is because he holds to the great principle and its manifestations—thus, it follows with the next step: holding to the great manifestations.\n\nWhen he holds to the great manifestations, all under Heaven proceed, yet they do so without harm, in peace and stability. The great manifestations are the great principles. The eight trigrams and nine categories are what is meant here.\n\nThe rulers of the *太古 (Tàigǔ, Great Antiquity)* governed with no action, relying solely on the virtue/power of Heaven. When the Sage established the trigrams and observed the manifestations, the distinctions of auspicious and inauspicious became clear, and transformations arose—thus there came to be gains and losses, advances and retreats.\n\nWhen the vast and primordial transformations first emerged, the governance of the great principles began to shape the world, and the world’s original purity and simplicity departed. *往 (wǎng, to proceed/leave)* here means *to depart/abandon*.\n\nOnce the original purity and simplicity have departed, the great principle may still be upheld—thus, to proceed does not bring harm. To proceed without harm is because he acts according to the times, establishes achievements based on resources, assigns roles according to ability, and does not damage their inherent nature—thus all under Heaven are at peace and stable.\n\nYan Junping says: *\"The Dao has no form, so Heaven and Earth rely on it to give birth. The Dao has no possession, so yin and yang rely on it to begin. The Dao has no fixed principle, so the four seasons rely on it for their work. The Dao has no manifestation, so all classes of beings rely on it to proceed.\"* Thus, the great principle has no principle, the great manifestation has no manifestation; greatness is without limit, yet it is not without possession. It gives birth where there is no birth, and denies where there is no denial—so the Dao achieves without action, and Heaven and Earth are thus formed; virtue/power is realized without labor, and all things find their place. What more need be done?\n\nNot without limit yet not without possession, not acting yet not denying—here the Dao finds its own way, and all things find their own way. This is what is called the virtue/power of Heaven.\n\nIf the Dao waits for transformations to occur through deliberate action before they manifest, then what it achieves will be few. If virtue/power waits for labor to arise before it applies its function, then what all things receive will be sparse. This is what is meant by gains and losses, advances and retreats—thus the following passage states:\n\n*\"Music and baits: passing guests will stop.\"* This is an illustrative metaphor.\n\nWhen music’s harmony is played, people must linger briefly. When the *鐸饵 (duò’ěr, ritual bells and lures)* are beautiful, guests must pause.\n\nWhen music is exhausted, the ears are filled yet pass onward. When the baits are overindulged, the tongue grows weary and recoils. When guests stop, the host grows weary and takes offense.\n\nWhen the law first arises, the people hold it dear and praise it. But when its flaws appear, they fear it and scorn it. Zhuangzi says: *\"Benevolence and righteousness are the ancestral halls of the former kings, where one may stay but one night, yet not dwell long-term. To observe and then criticize excessively—this is the proper use of law.\"* If it lingers in the world and grows corrupt, becoming stagnant and enduring, then reason must fail.\n\nOnce reason has failed, how could proceeding not bring harm?\n\n「Once having suffered its harm, then how could one speak of its peace and tranquility?\n\nThe Dao/Way, when uttered, is bland and without flavor.\n\nWhen music is exhausted and the baits are overindulged, the ears and tongue grow weary and recoil in excess. When the great law shows its flaws, fear and scorn become manifest.\n\nYet the Dao/Way, when spoken of, is bland and without taste—this is what is meant by *\"truthful words are not beautiful.\"* In stillness and simplicity, without contrivance, the people delight in their nature, thus they content with full bellies and dwell in ease, lost in the boundless and indistinct, unaware of their whereabouts.\n\nCould there ever be harmonious melodies or sweet flavors to be savored and chewed upon?\n\nThe Dao/Way is unseen when looked upon, unheard when listened to, and cannot be exhausted when applied.\n\nFor laws are shaped by contrivance, and those who cling to them will find their limits.\n\nThe Dao/Way is natural and without contrivance, yet neither sounds nor colors can fathom its depths.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Unseen when looked upon, unheard when listened to—from ancient times to today, its name never fades.\"* The common folk use it daily without knowing its true nature, yet it cannot be exhausted when applied.\n\nThe *象 (xiàng, form/manifestation)* without form means there is nothing to grasp. Without grasping, its application cannot be exhausted. But if one grasps it and claims possession, how could one avoid the extremes of excess and deficiency? Hence, it is followed by the principle: *\"When about to exhaust, first fully extend. When about to weaken, first fully strengthen. When about to abandon, first fully establish. When about to take away, first fully bestow.\"*\n\nThis is called *微明 (wēimíng, subtle clarity)*.\n\nMany learned interpreters of this chapter have offered varied explanations, yet none align with its proper structure. Some cite Confucius: *\"One may follow the Way with them, but not yet establish it; one may establish it with them, but not yet wield it with subtlety.\"* Others draw parallels with statecraft and strategic maneuvering, akin to the *纵横 (zōnghéng, sophistry/scheming)* school—equally unreliable. This is truly in harmony with the *阴符 (Yīnfú, Yinfu)*’s celestial mechanics, a secret employed by those of lofty insight and adaptable understanding.\n\nLu Xisheng said: *\"The profound dwelling of the Sage is nothing more exquisite than the interplay of *权实 (quánshí, expedient and truth)*. Truth is rooted in conformity with the natural order, while expedient arises from reversing established principles. Expedient aids truth, and truth enables expedient—though they differ in application, their essence converges in unity.\"*\n\nAfter Laozi first guided people with truth, establishing the teaching of *知常 (zhīcháng, knowing the constant)*, he further employed expedient to address practical matters, clarifying the necessity of reversal. This is what the *易 (Yì, I Ching)* speaks of: *\"Bending to complete all things without loss, encompassing heaven and earth without overreaching.\"*\n\nThe *Honglie Jie* says: *\"Qi Huan of Qi loved delicacies, and Yi Ya cooked his own son as bait to please him. The Lord of Yu loved treasures, and Duke Xian of Jin used a jade and a horse to lure him. The Hu King loved music, and Duke Mu of Qin used female dancers to entice him. These were all instances where people were ensnared by their own desires.\"*\n\nYan Junping said: *\"The Dao/Way traverses the moral realm, the divine illuminates it, heaven and earth transform through it, and yin and yang regulate it. Truth reverses into emptiness, clarity into obscurity, abundance into decline, tension into relaxation, possession into loss, life into death—these are the inherent natures of things and the natural principles of the Dao/Way.\n\nThus, the advantages of reversal and the benefits of yielding and extending: the Dao/Way governs heaven, heaven governs the sovereign, the sovereign governs his ministers, and the ministers govern the people. All living beings rely on this to sustain themselves.\n\nWhen tigers and leopards prepare to pounce, they first conceal their claws. When wolves and jackals are about to devour, their teeth are not seen. The Sage abandons his personal intentions to conform with the Dao/Way, the wise adapt to the world to serve the people. Loyal words, though harsh, preserve the truth; treacherous ministers, when rising, must be appeased by their lord. Knowing this and applying it, all within the six directions shall prosper.\n\nIgnoring this and applying it, even within the household, kin become bandits.\n\nThus, sons and brothers may become wolves and jackals when given advantage, while enemies and rivals may act as fathers and elders when denied. Yet within advantage lies disadvantage, and within disadvantage lies advantage—one may vanish while the other persists. Hence, even those who are not loyal cannot be trusted if they are close, and even those who are not virtuous cannot be loved if they are near. This is the lament of the worthy and the vigilant concern of the Sage and the wise.\n\nZhuangzi praised Xu Wugui’s audience with Duke Wu of Wei, where he first discussed horses and dogs before tiring the lord’s spirit and form, ultimately binding him with political counsel—this was the expedient of the wise, wielding extension and exhaustion.\n\nIf one applies this principle and extends it, then the meaning of *微明 (subtle clarity)* becomes evident.\n\nSoftness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength—this is the logic of the Dao/Way. Examining this reveals the application of *权变 (quánbiàn, expedient adaptation)*.\n\nFish cannot be pulled from the depths without harm, nor can the state’s instruments of utility be displayed to the people.\n\nThe state’s *权谋 (quánmóu, expedient strategies)* are great instruments for benefiting the world. If fish are wrenched from their natural pools and streams, even ants may torment them. If the state’s expedient strategies are leaked to the lower ranks, petty officials will exploit them—what of the cunning tyrants?\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* says: *\"Heaven has five hidden calamities; those who perceive them thrive. How could they be recklessly revealed?\"*\n\nAnother interpretation: *\"Fish pulled from the depths cannot be retrieved, and expedient lost to ministers cannot be reclaimed.\"*\n\nHan Fei said: *\"The sovereign’s power is like the depths—his ministers are fish within it. The ancients spoke in parables because of this.\n\nRewards and punishments are instruments of utility. The sovereign wields them to control his ministers, while the ministers seize them to dominate the sovereign. Hence, if the sovereign first reveals what he will reward, the ministers will scheme to earn his favor, claiming it as his virtue. If he first reveals what he will punish, the ministers will band together to shield themselves, calling it the strength of his rule. The state’s instruments of utility—should they not be handled with care?\"*\n\nThe *Honglie Jie* says: *\"In ancient times, Sici Zhihan served the state of Song. He told the Song ruler: 'The stability or peril of the state, the order or chaos of the people, rests on your administration of rewards and punishments.\n\nWhen you grant titles and favors, the people rejoice. When you mete out executions and punishments, the people resent them. Let me, your subject, bear the resentment, while you enjoy the favor.'\n\nThe Song ruler said: 'Good.' When I receive the praise, you shall bear the blame. I know well that I shall not be laughed at by the other lords.\"*」\n\nThe people of the state all knew that the power of executions rested solely with Sici Zhihan. The great ministers favored him, while the common folk feared him. Yet even after not reaching a full year in office, Zhihan resigned, leaving the Song ruler to monopolize governance—this was like a fish escaping from the depths, while the sharp tools of power were handed to the lower ranks.\n\nThe art of She Zhang in granting and withholding lies in subtlety, which is called *Dao of the Profound and Mysterious*.\n\nWhen the Dao is overt, the fish escapes from the depths;\nWhen it is subtle, it aligns with the *Dao of the Constant and Natural*.\nThus, it follows with the principle of *Dao of the Constant and Natural, Without Action*.\n\nThe *Dao of the Constant and Natural, Without Action* yet accomplishes all things—\nIf a lord or king could uphold it,\nAll things would naturally transform.\n\nFor the Dao is ever constant,\nDeep and still, unmoving—\nThus it is called *Without Action*.\n\nYet when it responds to things, all things move of their own accord—\nThus it is called *Without Not-Action*.\n\nIf a lord or king could always hold emptiness as his heart\nAnd *Without Action* as his form,\nUnyielding in his grasp yet never rigid,\nThen all things would naturally conform to his transformation.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"I act without action, and the people transform themselves.\nIf they transform yet wish to act,\nI shall govern them with the nameless and pure.\"*\n\nFor the virtuous few in the world are outnumbered by the unvirtuous many—\nThus, the sage’s *virtue-transformations* are always in aid of the good,\nAnd even if some do not follow his transformation but instead stir and act contrary to the Dao,\nThe sage still remains lenient,\nAnd shall govern them with the nameless Dao of purity,\nTo bring them to stillness and *Without Action*—\nThen the world will naturally settle.\n\nThe Dao itself leaves no trace,\nYet it borrows the pure and simple to speak of it;\nThose who cling to its traces,\nWho grasp at the pure and simple as something fixed,\nBecome the bane of later ages.\nThe sage fears that this bane cannot be cured,\nSo he shall also not desire to preserve this nameless purity—\nThen the world will gradually settle of its own accord,\nEntering the *Dao of the Constant and Natural, Without Action* yet *Without Not-Action*.\n\nLu Xi Sheng says:\nThe first chapter takes *Constant Dao* as its essence,\n*Constant Dao* as its application,\nAnd culminates in the profound depths.\nThis chapter takes *Without Action* as its essence,\n*Without Not-Action* as its application,\nAnd unifies them with *comprehensive forgetting*—\nIts beginning and end are interlinked,\nAnd it exhausts the essence and application.\n\nThe *Dao of the Constant and Natural, Without Action*—\nThis is called *Constant Dao*.\n*Constant Dao* responds to changes,\nYet accomplishes all things without fail.\n\n**The Daoist Classic of the *Zangshi Mowei* Chapter Five concludes.**\n**The Daoist Classic of the *Zangshi Zuanwei* Chapter Six concludes.**\n\n**The Daoist Classic of the *Zangshi Mowei* (Continued) – Chapter Seven**\n\n**Bìxū Zǐ Chén Jǐngyuán’s Annotation:**\n\nThe lower section elucidates *virtue/power (dé)*, taking *not-virtue (bùdé)* as its origin.\n*Not-virtue* is the forgetting of *virtue/power* in order to respond to things.\n\nThe *highest virtue/power* is *not-virtue*—thus it possesses *virtue/power*.\n*Virtue/power* is *obtaining (dé)*.\nWithin, it is obtained in the heart;\nWithout, it is obtained in things—\nAlways obtained yet never lost,\nBeneficial yet never harmful.\nWhen things thrive through it, this is called *virtue/power*.\n\nIts origin lies in the *Dao’s* accumulation—\nThus it has *virtue/power*.\nHaving *virtue/power* yet no name—\nThis is the *Dao’s* profundity.\nHaving *virtue/power* yet a name—\nThis is the *Dao’s* shallowness.\nThe *Dao* has depth and shallowness—\nThus *virtue/power* has high and low.\n\nThe so-called *highest virtue/power*—\nThis is *ultimate virtue/power*.\n*Ultimate virtue/power* is profound,\nIs distant,\nAnd harmonizes with things.\nPeople do not see its traces—\nThus it is called *not-virtue*,\nFor it contains light yet conceals brilliance,\nIts actions are fragmented yet complete,\nCausing the people to use it daily without knowing,\nAnd its *virtue/power* is whole—\nThus it is said to possess *virtue/power*.\n\nThe *lower virtue/power* does not lose *virtue/power*—\nThus it is *not-virtue*.\nThe *lower virtue/power*—\nIts traces and actions gradually become manifest,\nScattered like a single flower’s petals,\nFollowing things passively,\nWhile things preserve their own ease.\nThe world praises it,\nAttributing beauty to itself—\nYet it is distant from *ultimate virtue/power*,\nAnd loses *ultimate virtue/power*—\nThus it is said to be *not-virtue*.\n\nThe *highest virtue/power* acts *without action*,\nYet does nothing—\nThe one with *highest virtue/power*,\nNaturally receives the utmost subtlety,\nObtains the essence of *original qi*,\nHis spirit permeates heaven and earth,\nHis clarity rivals the sun and moon,\nWith no thought, no deliberation—\nHis heart is naturally *without action*,\nForgetting merit, forgetting traces,\nDoing nothing yet obtaining all—\nThis is called *without action* yet *without not-action*.\n\nThe ancient text reads: *The highest virtue/power acts without action yet without not-action.*\nIt speaks of those with *highest virtue/power*—\nTheir mind is still, their nature serene,\nEven their desires do not defy nature,\nTheir actions do not oppose all things—\nThus they act *without action* yet *without not-action*.\n\nThe *lower virtue/power* acts,\nYet does nothing—\nThe *lower virtue/power* descends from the *highest virtue/power*,\nNaturally receiving the plain and ordinary,\nObtaining the pure harmony of *original qi*,\nHis spirit aligns with yin and yang,\nHis clarity mirrors the sun and moon,\nThe people all revere and joyfully extol him—\nThus it is said to do nothing.\n\nThe ancient text reads: *The lower virtue/power acts yet does nothing.*\nIt speaks of those with *lower virtue/power*—\nTheir minds imitate emptiness,\nThey cling to the void,\nResponding to things with caution,\nDaring not to act hastily—\nThus it is said to do nothing.\n\n*Highest benevolence (shàngrén)* acts,\nYet does nothing—\nThe benevolent universally bestow and love all—\nAll things are possible.\nPossible yet without partiality—\nThus it is called *highest benevolence*.\nWith a mind to benefit all beings—\nThus it is said to act.\nMerit accomplished yet not claimed,\nAffairs completed yet not controlled—\nThus it is said to do nothing.\n\n*Highest righteousness (shàngyì)* acts,\nYet does something—\nRighteousness is what is fitting.\nWhat is fitting must entail some loss,\nYet in all matters, nothing is unfitting—\nThus it is called *highest righteousness*.\nThere is fitting and benefit—\nThus it acts.\nWhat it does involves cutting and severing—\nThus it is said to do something.\n\n*Highest ritual (shànglǐ)* acts,\nYet none respond—\nThen it rolls up its sleeves and drags them along.\n*Rolling up its sleeves*—\nExposing the arms by pushing aside sleeves.\n*Drags*—draws.\nRitual is *treading*—\nTreading the *Dao* and walking,\nDistinguishing high and low,\nFixing noble and base,\nWith humility, respect, harmony, and gentleness—\nThis is the root of ritual—\nThus it is called *highest*.\nJade and silk exchanged,\n威仪相答 (威严的仪节相互应答),\nBowing, kneeling, clenching fists,\nAdvancing, retreating, glancing and bowing—\nThis is the ornament of ritual—\nThus it is called *lower*.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*The greatest ritual aligns with heaven and earth in rhythm.*\nAgain:\n*Those who use ritual as wings—*\nThis is how they move through the world.\n\nThe ancient sages established ritual\nTo settle the mind and *qi*,\nTo refine appearance—\nThus it is said to act.\nYet the mediocre and lowly\nAbandon the root and exalt the branches,\nTwisting explanations and multiplying complexities,\nUnable to respond—\nThus it is said none respond.\nThis is the slight failing of ritual.\nBut there are those who flush with anger,\nBrandishing arms,\nDragging fingers to point out right and wrong,\nCompeting—\nThis is the extreme failing of ritual.\n\nThe Master Lao enumerates the undifferentiated and scattered,\nArriving at this in the lower text.\n\nYán Jūnping said:\n*Empty and without action, guiding all things—*\nThis is called the *Daoist*.\n*Clear and tranquil, responding without fail—*\nThis is called the *virtuous*.\n*Compassionately loving all things, endlessly bestowing—*\nThis is called the *benevolent*.\n*Rectifying names, aligning reality, acting appropriately—*\nThis is called the *righteous*.\n*Humble, retiring, courteous, guarding harmony—*\nThis is called the *ritualist*.\n\nThese five are all traces of the *Dao’s* exposition,\nNot the *ultimate ultimate*.\n\nThe *ultimate ultimate* transcends all distinctions—\nHow could there be these five?\n\nThus, losing the *Dao* leads to *virtue/power*,\nLosing *virtue/power* leads to *benevolence*,\nLosing *benevolence* leads to *righteousness*,\nLosing *righteousness* leads to *ritual*.\n*Dao, virtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, ritual*—\nThese five are the *Dao’s* essence,\nUnattainable through inquiry—\nThus they are merged into one.\nOnce divided, the five distinctions appear,\nAnd their traces become manifest—\nThus they are applied according to the age.\n\nThe *Dao* is the essence of *virtue/power*,\n*Virtue/power* is the function of the *Dao*.\nSeparating essence for function—\nThus losing the *Dao* leads to *virtue/power*.\n*Virtue/power* is *obtaining (dé)*.\nWhen things obtain life, this is called *virtue/power*—\nWhere there is life, there must be love—\nThus losing *virtue/power* leads to *benevolence*.\n*Benevolence* is *kinship (qīn)*.\nLoving things appropriately—\nThus losing *benevolence* leads to *righteousness*.\n*Righteousness* is *what is fitting (yí)*.\nWhat is fitting demands humility and respect—\nThus losing *righteousness* leads to *ritual*.\n*Ritual* is *treading (lǚ)*—\nTreading the *Dao* to form its patterns—\nSimple and direct, it is easy to follow;\nComplex and twisted, it leads to chaos.\n*Losing*—this is *extinction*.\nWhen the branches flourish and the root perishes—\nThis is the natural order.\n\nYán Jūnping said:\n*The emperor’s foundation—*\nThe *Dao* is its root,\n*Virtue/power* is its beginning.\nLosing the *Dao*, *virtue/power* follows;\nLosing *virtue/power*, *benevolence* follows;\nLosing *benevolence*, *righteousness* follows;\nLosing *righteousness*, *ritual* follows;\nLosing *ritual*, chaos follows.\nThese five are the *Dao’s* unified body,\nYet the world’s rulers vary in length.\n\nThe purpose is not what one truly desires,\nThe pursuit is not what one truly obtains—\nThey neglect the natural Way and instead cling to petty trifles.\n\nNow, *ritual* as a practice:\nWithin and without, it contradicts itself,\nFlourishing in ornament while lacking substance,\nIts branches thrive while its roots wither.\n*Ritual* grows thin compared to loyalty,\nAuthority grows light compared to *virtue/power*,\nFaith does not reach *righteousness*,\n*Virtue/power* does not suffice for *benevolence*.\nThis is the end of governance,\nThe beginning of chaos.\nDeceit and pretense arise from it,\nAnger and contention take root—\nThis is what is called *superficial* teaching.\n\nFor *ritual* is the thinning of loyalty and faith,\nAnd the origin of chaos.\nIf one abandons *virtue/power*, *moral cultivation*, *benevolence*, and *righteousness*,\nAnd relies solely on *ritual* and teaching—\nIs this not the thinning of loyalty and faith,\nAnd the origin of chaos?\n\nBut if one reveres *virtue/power* and the seven *righteous acts*,\nAnd harmonizes them with *ritual* and teaching—\nThen *ritual* is elevated above them,\nAnd where would there be disorder?\n\nZhuangzi said:\nThe Sage acts through unsaid teaching.\nThe *Dao* cannot be attained,\n*Virtue/power* cannot be reached,\nBut *benevolence* can be cultivated,\nAnd *righteousness* can be diminished,\nWhile *ritual* is where pretense thrives—\nThis aligns with the origin of chaos.\n\n*Foresight* is the ornament of the *Dao*,\nAnd the beginning of folly.\nTo cultivate and exalt *ritual* and teaching is wisdom—\nWisdom is foresight,\nThus it is called *foresight*.\nOnce foresight precedes things,\nHow can one remain detached?\nThus governing with wisdom is a state’s ruin—\nIs this not the ornament of the *Dao*\nAnd the beginning of folly?\n\nBut if one conceals foresight and wisdom,\nThinking and deliberating nothing,\nThen one returns to simplicity and purity.\n\nExcessive *ritual* leads to chaos,\nExcessive wisdom leads to deceit—\nThis is an inevitable truth.\n\nThus, the true person dwells in substance, not ornament,\nIn reality, not superficiality—\nHence, they discard the latter and embrace the former.\n\nThe true person is one who follows the *Dao*.\nWenzi said:\nThe true person is serene without thought,\nUnburdened without worry,\nWalks where there are no paths,\nMoves without fatigue,\nExits without gates,\nEnters without walls,\nUnites their vital essence,\nLulls their perceptions,\nVacant and unforced—\nYet nothing remains undone.\n\nThus, their dwelling is naturally pure and substantial,\nIn harmony with the highest *virtue/power*.\n\nResiding in loyalty and faith,\nDiligently pursuing sincerity—\nHow could they indulge in ornament, pretense, or deceit?\n\nTherefore, they discard the shallow ends of *ritual* and *righteousness*,\nAnd take the great foundation of *virtue/power* and *moral cultivation*.\n\nThe ancient text originally combined these four sentences with the character *chǔ* (处).\n\nThere is a wondrous *Dao*, and from it all things are born.\nThe great *virtue/power* of Heaven and Earth is called *generativity*.\nThings receive *generativity* and call it *virtue/power*—\nThus, it is called *uppermost* *virtue/power*.\nIn *virtue/power*, there is no loss—\nThus, it is called *lowermost* *virtue/power*.\nThough upper and lower differ,\nEach attains its unity—\nHence, it follows with the *One* of antiquity.\n\nThe *One* of antiquity:\nHeaven, obtaining *One*, is clear;\nEarth, obtaining *One*, is tranquil;\nThe *Spirit*, obtaining *One*, is numinous;\nThe *Valley*, obtaining *One*, is full;\nAll things, obtaining *One*, are born;\nThe sovereign, obtaining *One*, corrects the world.\nThis is how they attain *One*.\n\n*Antiquity* refers to the distant past.\n*The One* is the primal *qi*.\nPrimal *qi* is the child of the Great *Dao*,\nThe mother of the numinous,\nThe ancestor of Great Harmony,\nThe progenitor of Heaven and Earth.\nCondensed, it forms living beings;\nDispersed, it radiates as light.\nIn the yin, it shares the yin’s *virtue/power*;\nIn the yang, it rides the yang’s waves.\nIt dwells in the Celestial Capital yet remains untainted,\nIt resides in the humble hut yet remains unsoiled.\nIts position is unchanging above and below,\nIts essence is undivided through ages—\nThus, it is called *One*.\n\nConcealed within the heart, it is the *Numinous Treasury*;\nAscending to the mind, it is the *Numinous Platform*;\nMotionless and still, it is the *True Sovereign*;\nGuiding the form, it is the *True Ruler*.\nWhen coiled, it retreats into the pores;\nWhen unfurled, it fills the vast expanse.\n\nThe *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\nObtain *One*, and all matters are complete.\nIf a person empties their heart,\n*The One* will naturally return.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*Qi* is the void that awaits things.\nOnly the *Dao* gathers the void.\nAgain, it says:\n*The empty chamber births white auspiciousness*—\nStop, stop.\n\nHeaven is the pure yang *qi*.\nAnd Heaven, obtaining it, thus moves vigorously and dynamically,\nIts dome vast and encompassing,\nIts symbols clear and bright—\nAll things derive their origin from it.\n\nEarth is the pure yin substance.\nAnd Earth, obtaining it, thus remains faithful, yielding, and weak,\nIts foundation firm and thickly bearing,\nIts stability unshaken—\nAll things derive their sustenance from it.\n\nThe *Spirit* is the subtle expression of all things.\nAnd the *Spirit*, obtaining it, thus transforms without limit,\nIts reversals endless,\nIts rectitude resonant and responsive—\nIts correspondence to things is inexhaustible.\n\nThe *Valley* is the deepest of the Han.\nAnd the *Valley*, obtaining it, thus moves *qi* and channels water,\nIts fullness unexhausted.\n\nThe *Ten Thousand* refers to the greatness of numbers.\n*Things* are the visible forms.\nAnd things, obtaining it, thus generate and complete without ceasing—\nTheir extinction is unknown.\n\nThe *Marquis* and *King* are the five ranks of nobility.\nThe *King* is the general term for ruler.\nObtaining it, they thus eternally possess the great treasure,\nTheir will unchallenged—\nAnd they correct the world.\n\nThese five attain clarity, tranquility, numinosity, and fullness,\nAnd all things thrive because the sovereign’s *Dao* is correct.\n\n*Correctness* means attaining the *One* of the primal void.\nIf the *One* is lost, all things perish—\nAs stated below.\n\nThe *Kaiyuan* edition reads: *\"Their governance lacks the One,\"*\nTwo characters missing in meaning.\nThis follows the ancient text as correct.\n\nYán Jūnping’s version omits:\n*\"All things obtain it and thus are born,\"*\nAnd the following fourteen characters:\n*\"All things, without it, would fear extinction.\"*\nFor humans are the most refined of all things,\nAnd the sovereign is the ruler of humans—\nThus, it is summarized.\n\nWith it, the text is complete;\nWithout it, the meaning is not lacking—\nThis also aligns with principle.\n\nHeaven, without clarity, would fear cracking;\nEarth, without tranquility, would fear upheaval;\nThe *Spirit*, without numinosity, would fear cessation;\nThe *Valley*, without fullness, would fear exhaustion;\nAll things, without *generativity*, would fear annihilation;\nThe sovereign, without exalted nobility, would fear ruin.\n\n*\"Without it\"* refers to the language of warning through consequences.\n\nHeaven is the manifestation of the *virtue/power* of Yang, the emblem of the sovereign. When it is said that Heaven lacks clarity, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of supreme luminosity, leading to discord between Yin and Yang, the collapse of order and principles, and the stagnation of the unified *qi*—thus risking the omen of fissures. Moreover, when Yang *qi* is excessive, calamities and decline must follow; when the harmonious balance disperses, fissures must occur. Thus, the *Yin-Yang Book* states: *\"Heaven’s cracking is the result of insufficient Yang *qi* and the decline of the sovereign’s virtue.\"*\n\nFrom here onward, all are words of admonition.\n\nEarth is the manifestation of the *virtue/power* of Yin, the emblem of the minister. When it is said that Earth lacks tranquility, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of serenity, leading to the distortion of firmness and softness, the collapse of mountains and rivers, and the failure to uphold the unified *qi*—thus risking the consequences of eruption and overflow. Moreover, when Yin *qi* reaches its extreme, there must be flooding disasters; when the harmonious balance dissipates, eruptions must occur. Thus, the *Yin-Yang Book* states: *\"Earthquakes arise from excess Yin *qi* and the neglect of the minister’s duty.\"*\n\nThe *Spirit* is the essence of transformation. All things with refined vitality possess their *Spirit*—an unfathomable interplay of Yin and Yang. When it is said that the *Spirit* lacks numinosity, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of supreme transformation, leading to the birth of calamities and omens, the rise of portents, and the abandonment of the unified *qi*—thus risking the time of cessation. When the *Spirit* strays from the *Way*, it harms the people; when the people are harmed, they rebel in destruction. Destruction without *Spirit*—what else but cessation?\n\nThe *Valley* is the void that receives all things. When it is said that the *Valley* lacks fullness, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of flowing nourishment, leading to the fear of collapse and desolation, the obstruction of the unified *qi*—thus risking the isolation of exhaustion. Exhaustion affects the state, hence the Luo River’s drying led to the fall of Xia, and the Yellow River’s depletion caused the ruin of Shang.\n\nAll things have form and substance, destined to transform. When it is said that all things lack *generativity*, if they rely on themselves as if on something secure, they lose the *Way* of yielding compliance, leading to the inversion of nature’s order, the dispersal of the unified *qi*—thus risking the period of annihilation.\n\nThe sovereign unites the Three Realms as sovereign and governs all things. He must cultivate humility to nurture the talents of the people. When it is said that the sovereign lacks exalted nobility, if he relies on himself as if on something secure, he loses the *Way* of pure transformation, causing officials to neglect their duties, the people to abandon loyalty, and the risk of ruin and overthrow. All the matters mentioned above—though extending to Heaven and Earth—ultimately serve as warnings to the sovereign.\n\nIf the sovereign heeds these warnings, how much more should the common people?\n\nThus, nobility finds its foundation in humility, and height finds its base in lowliness.\n\nNobility—how can it arise from itself? It must be upheld by the humble, and only then does it attain nobility. This is the foundation of humility.\n\nHeight—how can it arise from itself? It must be borne by those beneath, and only then does it attain elevation. This is the base of lowliness.\n\nTherefore, the sovereign addresses himself as *\"lonely, widowed, and unworthy\"*—is this not the embodiment of humility as foundation? Is it not so? *\"Lonely, widowed, and unworthy\"* are terms of common reproach, yet the sovereign adopts them as titles, cultivating humility to avoid arrogance. Is this not the foundation of humility? And if it is not, then truly it is the foundation of humility.\n\nThus, when praised repeatedly, he does not take pride. A sage ruler forgets his name and self; though the world praises him often, he does not grow more encouraged. Though the world criticizes him often, he does not grow discouraged. How would he know whether he is truly noble or not?\n\nThe *Guoyu* text reads: *\"When praised repeatedly, there is no praise.\"* When considering the components of a chariot, there are wheels, axles, frames, and shafts—yet none is called a \"chariot\" alone. Only when combined do they form a chariot. When considering the components of a state, there are scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants—yet none is called a \"state\" alone. Only when combined do they form a state. How could a chariot be formed without its parts? How could a state survive without its people? This is a grave warning to the sovereign, urging him to love his people.\n\nHe does not wish to shine like jade, nor to be dull like stone.\n*Jianjian*—the appearance of jade.\n*Luoluo*—the appearance of stone.\nA sage ruler does not desire ostentation like jade, nor does he wish to be obscure like stone. Instead, he cultivates a hidden light, guarding the *Way* of the unified *qi*, becoming the model for all under Heaven.\n\nThe ancient text reads: *\"Like jade, like stone.\"* The transmitted versions by Yan Yuan and Xu Xian adopt this.\n\nHaving attained nobility and height, yet grounding himself in humility, addressing himself as lonely and widowed, repeatedly practicing modesty—this is why it is followed by the *Way* of return.\n\n*Return* is the movement of the *Way*.\n*Return* means restoration, transformation.\nThe origin of all things lies in emptiness and stillness.\nBefore things arise, they first return to the origin of emptiness and stillness. When they transform, they emerge from emptiness and stillness into motion—thus, first returning, then moving.\n\nTherefore, the *Yijing* states in the *Fu* (Return) hexagram:\n*\"The firm returns and moves, yielding and proceeding—\nThus, entering and exiting without haste—\nThis is what is meant.\"*\n\nThe weak are the application of the *Way*.\nSince returning to emptiness and stillness is the movement of the *Way*, then softness, weakness, and receptivity are truly the application of the *Way*.\n\nAll things under Heaven are born from existence, and existence is born from nonexistence.\nExistence is the One.\nThe One is the Original *Qi*.\nIt is said that all things under Heaven are born from the Original *Qi*. The Original *Qi* possesses light without form—though light and shadow emerge from the void.\n\nThe void is the substance of the *Way*.\n*The Liezi* states:\n*\"Formed things arise from the formless—\nThen how did Heaven and Earth come to be?\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"Movement without form does not produce form,\nYet produces shadow.\nSound without substance does not produce sound,\nYet produces echo.\nThe void in motion does not produce the void,\nYet produces existence.\"*\n\nThus, all things are born from existence, and existence is born from nonexistence—yet all things transform uniquely.\n\nYan Junping says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are born from Great Harmony,\nAnd Great Harmony is born from the void—\nThis is the origin of returning to emptiness and stillness.\"*\n\nThe moment things are about to move, they first return to the origin of emptiness and stillness.\nOnly the superior sage understands how to move from emptiness and stillness—\nthus, the next passage speaks of the superior sage hearing the *Dao*.\n\nThe superior sage hears the *Dao* and diligently practices it.\nThe mediocre sage hears the *Dao* yet is half-convinced, half-doubtful—\nthus, it is as if it exists and as if it does not.\nThe inferior sage hears the *Dao* and laughs loudly in disbelief.\nIf it is not laughed at, then it is not worthy to be called the *Dao*.\n\nThe superior sage, by nature, is pure and tranquil,\nserene and undisturbed, empty and without action,\nunadulterated and unchanging, still as one—\nwhen he hears the *Dao*, people observe his conduct,\ntruly believing he diligently practices it,\nyet in reality, he does nothing at all.\nThis is what is called effortless mastery.\n\nThe mediocre sage, by nature, is moderate—\nthings the world does not use.\nHe retreats to marshes and valleys, seeking quiet and spaciousness,\nexhales the old and inhales the new,\nendures hardship like the bear and soars like the phoenix,\nmerely nurturing his body and preserving his spirit.\nBut when he is put to use by the world,\nhe speaks of great achievements,\nestablishes great reputation,\nhonors the relationships of lord and subject,\nrectifies the order of high and low,\nand governs affairs—\nthis is what is called as if it exists and as if it does not.\n\nThe inferior sage, by nature, is coarse and defiled—\nhis eyes crave to see colors,\nhis ears crave to hear sounds,\nhis mouth craves to savor flavors,\nhis intentions crave to be fulfilled.\nWhen he hears of serene tranquility and non-action,\nhe laughs loudly and rejects it.\nIf it is not rejected and laughed at by the inferior sage,\nthen it is not worthy to be the true *Dao*.\n\nYan Junping says:\n*\"The quail and partridge fly high,\nyet their hearts are set on the humble weeds.\nThe wild goose and crane take great strides,\ncrossing mountains and rivers,\nyet their hearts are set on the marshes and pools.\nThe phoenix and cranes soar above the lofty peaks,\ngliding through the boundless purity,\ntheir brilliance obscuring the sun and moon,\ntheir gaze reaching far and wide,\ndwelling in the eight extremes,\nthus finding their perfect place.\nAll three take pleasure in their own ways—\nthus, the infinite source and the deep spring\nare where the divine dragon returns,\nwhile the small fish flee.\"*\n\nHigh mountains and great mounds,\ndense forests and vast ravines,\nare where the wild goose and tiger delight—\nyet where the fowl and dogs recoil.\n\nThus, to diminish sharpness and abandon clever scheming,\nto return to truth and embrace simplicity,\nto wander in the Great Purity,\nto hold the world in contempt,\nto remain untainted and unperturbed,\nto let joy and anger not dwell in the heart,\nto let gain and loss not linger in the mind,\nto treat noble and base alike,\nto embrace *virtue* and contain harmony—\nthese are the ideals of the Great Sage,\nthe true pursuits of the superior sage,\nthe bewilderment of the mediocre sage,\nand the great laughter of the inferior sage.\n\nLu Xisheng says:\n*\"The *Dao* above form is called the *Dao*—\nit transcends all forms.\nThe *Dao* below form is called *instrumentality*—\nit conforms to all forms within.\nThe superior sage knows both subtlety and manifestation,\ntranscending all forms—\nthus, when he hears the *Dao* and believes it,\nhe diligently practices it.\nThe mediocre sage is caught between subtlety and manifestation,\ndwelling in the space between *Dao* and *instrumentality*—\nwhen he hears the *Dao*, he is half-doubtful, half-convinced—\nthus, it is as if it exists and as if it does not.\nThe inferior sage knows only manifestation and not subtlety,\nstopping at mere forms—\nthus, when he hears the *Dao*, he laughs loudly,\nnot only laughing but also rejecting it.\"*\n\nThe *Dao* is subtle and profound, mysterious and all-pervading,\ndeep beyond recognition—\nif it is not rejected and laughed at by the inferior sage,\nthen it is not worthy to be the true essence of the *Dao*.\n\nThe following words explain:\n*\"Establishing\"* means *\"to set up\"*—\nthe passage that follows explains the words of the three sages,\ntheir differing perceptions, and the state of being laughed at.\n\n*\"Clarifying the *Dao* as if in darkness\"*—\n*\"Clarifying\"* means *\"to meet and understand face-to-face\"*—\nthose who awaken to the *Dao* hold their light within,\ntheir actions and demeanor like an unlit lamp.\nThus, the mediocre sage doubts its existence or non-existence,\nand the inferior sage laughs loudly at it.\n\n*\"Advancing the *Dao* seems like retreating\"*—\nThe superior sage reaches enlightenment without effort,\nmuch less does he advance it.\nEven with sage-like achievements,\nhe does not take them for himself,\nand in mingling with the dust and engaging with the world,\nit seems as if he is retreating and failing.\n\n*\"Equalizing the *Dao* as if it were a kind\"*—\n*\"Equalizing\"* means *\"level and even\"*—\n*\"kind\"* refers to uneven silk, which is discarded by weavers.\nThe superior sage’s heart is broad and level,\nhis *virtue* undivided—\nyet if it is uneven like silk with flaws,\nit will not be used by the world.\nRiver Master’s version reads *\"kind\"*—\nthose who follow the Great *Dao* are broad and level,\nadapting to all without distinction.\n\n*\"Highest *virtue* resembles a valley\"*—\nThose of highest *virtue* act without action,\ntheir minds aligned with the void,\nneither lofty nor low, beyond measure—\nlike a deep valley, containing all.\n\n*\"Great purity resembles defilement\"*—\nGreat purity is like the whiteness of snow and frost,\nunrestricted in its reach,\neven in filthy, neglected places,\nit spreads without discrimination.\nThose who follow the *Dao* are surely no different—\nthus, in a defiled world,\nthey remain purely white and untainted.\n\n*\"Vast *virtue* seems insufficient\"*—\nSun Deng says:\n*\"If one’s *virtue* is deep and vast,\nthen it appears distant and neglects small details,\nits wisdom seemingly lacking.\nThus, a good merchant hides his wares as if empty,\nand a gentleman of great *virtue* looks foolish in appearance.\"*\n\nLu Xisheng says:\n*\"To clothe all under Heaven yet not claim its *virtue*—\nthis is vast *virtue* seeming insufficient.\"*\n\n*\"Establishing *virtue* resembles stealing\"*—\nThis refers to hidden, secret *virtue*.\nThose who establish hidden *virtue*\ndo not display their deeds,\nfearing others’ knowledge—\nthus, it seems like stealing.\n\nWu Jun’s *Treatise on the Primordial Thread* says:\n*\"One’s deeds should be hidden,\none’s mistakes should be obvious—\nhidden deeds can be preserved,\nobvious mistakes are easily corrected.*\nThis is what is meant.\n\n*\"True essence resembles corruption\"*—\n*\"Corruption\"* means *\"change\"* and *\"dullness\"*—\nthose of pure essence act without ostentation,\nlike uneven silk, their brilliance unexpressed.\nZhuan Yi’s *Explanation of Meaning* states:\n*\"Ancient texts read ‘*shū*’ (输).*\n*The *Guangya* says: ‘*shū*’ means ‘*foolish*.’*\nSome read ‘*yú*’ (榆).\nDong Yu reads ‘*yáo*’ (摇).\nNow, following Wang Bi and Zhuan Yi’s reading, we take ‘*yú*’ (渝).*\n\n*\"The square has no corners\"*—\nKaiyuan Imperial Commentary says:\n*\"Square\"* means *\"rectitude\"*—\n*\"corners\"* means *\"angles\"*—\nthose who polish their reputation and name\nto establish a sharp, upright stance,\ndo so to create a corner of integrity.\n\nThis is what is meant by the \"bounded teachings\" of the common scholar—not the \"great square\" of the sage.\n\nTo polish without brilliance,\nto dwell in filth without staining—\nthis is the great square.\nTo blend light with dust,\nto walk without sharp distinction—\nthis is without corners.\n\nGreat vessels take long to mature;\ntheir use is complete when their purpose is fulfilled.\nRiver Above Master said:\nThe great *gān* (柑) of humanity,\nlike the Nine Tripods and coral waves,\nis not formed in a single day.\nAccumulated habits yield enduring beauty—\nperfection lies in duration.\n\nGreat sound is rare in voice;\nRiver Above Master said:\nGreat sound is like thunder waiting for its moment to move—\nit is the *qi* of love, sparse in words.\nThunder still strikes the ears—\nhow much more so the profound words?\n\nLu Xi’s *Hixiang* said:\nThrough silent teaching,\nstirring all things without resorting to frivolous speech—\nthis is great sound, rare in voice.\n\nGreat form is shapeless;\nRiver Above Master said:\nThose who embody the great *xiàng* (象) are simple and unadorned.\nHe who possesses great *xiàng* responds without form—\nsaying that great *xiàng* responds to all *xiàng* is to say it cannot be fixed by form,\nhence it is shapeless.\n\nThe Dao is hidden, nameless.\nThe Dao originally had no name,\nyet it was forcibly named *Dao*.\nNow the Dao is hidden again—\nwhat name remains?\nThis is truly the erasure of traces, concealment of origins.\n\nHeaven follows the Dao—\nvirtue is lent and fulfilled.\n*Across* (贷) means to bestow.\nTo praise this wondrous Dao alone—\nit can move gods and spirits, emperors and deities,\ngenerate heaven and earth.\nIt lends its pure, harmonious, wondrous *qi* to all things,\nfulfilling their nature and returning to spontaneity.\n\nJun Ping said:\nThe Dao’s transformation begins with nothing,\nends with no end,\nexists in non-existence,\nlends without expectation.\nIn motion, it forms all things;\nin stillness, the world is at ease.\n\nLu Xi’s *Hixiang* said:\nOnly those who generously bestow upon all things,\nwithout demanding repayment,\nare why all things receive their fulfillment\nyet know not its virtue.\nThus, the lesser scholars hear this Dao and scoff,\ndoubting its power.\n\nThe superior scholar diligently practices,\nestablishing virtue—\nthe Dao generates One.\n\nThe Dao generates One,\nOne generates Two,\nTwo generates Three,\nThree generates all things.\n\nThe Dao is the emptiness of emptiness,\nthe nothingness of nothingness—\nthe natural thusness.\n\nMysterious, boundless, supreme void,\nprofound silence, deep unity—\nineffable and unspeakable.\n\nYet when it moves, it produces transformation—\nthis is called *húnlún* (浑沦).\n*Húnlún* is One.\n*Húnlún* One—\nbefore *qi* disperses,\nthere must be spirit and clarity,\nlatent within.\n\nSpirit and clarity are Two.\nWith spirit and clarity comes division—\nthus, the three *qi* of purity, turbidity, and harmony\nemerge in sighs,\neach returning to its place.\nHence, pure *qi* becomes Heaven,\nturbid *qi* becomes Earth,\nharmonious *qi* becomes Humanity.\n\nWith the Three Talents complete,\nall things are nourished to life.\n\nJun Ping said:\nThe emptiness of emptiness generates the nothingness of nothingness;\nthe nothingness of nothingness generates the formless.\nThus, all formed things belong to their kind,\nand each kind has its origin.\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of things,\nwith Humanity following.\n\nWhen Heaven and Humanity are born,\nform arises from *qi*,\n*qi* from harmony,\nharmony from spirit and clarity,\nspirit and clarity from the Dao.\nThe Dao’s natural unfolding sustains all things,\nso Heaven is Heaven not by itself,\nHumanity is Humanity not by itself.\n\nGu Shenzzi said:\nThe Dao naturally transforms and generates spirit,\nspirit moves and forms harmony,\nharmony disperses and *qi* congeals,\n*qi* congeals and form is made—\nthus, the Dao generates One,\nOne generates Two,\nTwo generates Three,\nThree generates all things.\n\nRiver Above Master said:\nThe Dao’s first generation is One;\nOne generates Yin and Yang,\nYin and Yang generate the three harmonious *qi* of purity, turbidity, and harmony,\nwhich divide into Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\nHeaven and Earth, with Humanity, generate all things.\nHeaven bestows, Earth transforms,\nHumanity nurtures them.\n\nKaiyuan Imperial Commentary said:\nThe Dao is the supreme spirit of ultimate emptiness.\nOne is the refined *qi* of pure harmony.\nTo generate is to move and produce.\nSpeaking of the Dao’s movement producing harmonious *qi* to generate things,\nyet this still does not suffice for the principle of response—\nfurther, Yang *qi* is generated,\naccumulating Yang to complete One—\nthus, One generates Two.\nPure Yang alone cannot generate,\nso Yin *qi* is generated,\naccumulating Yin to complete Two—\nthus, Two generates Three.\nThree generates all things—\nwhen Yin and Yang interact harmoniously,\nand the pure *qi* refines,\nthen myriad beings proliferate.\nThe three schools’ accounts differ slightly in detail;\nhere, all are preserved.\n\nAll things bear Yin on their backs and embrace Yang,\nusing harmonious *qi* as their mediator.\n*Negative* (负) means to turn away;\n*embrace* (抱) means to face.\nLiving things fear death and seek life,\nplants turn from cold and toward warmth.\nTheir skin and texture envelop externally—\nskin and texture are where Yin *qi* congeals,\nhence it is said they bear Yin.\nTheir marrow fills internally—\nmarrow is where Yang *qi* gathers,\nhence it is said they embrace Yang.\nThe充和 *chōnghé* *qi* circulates between,\nthus forming the essence of life.\n\nWhen harmonious *qi* is full and complete,\nthe essence of life is unharmed,\nand vitality reigns.\nWhen harmonious *qi* decays and scatters,\nthe essence of life separates,\nand death ensues.\n\nThus, the sage empties his spiritual repository,\nand pure whiteness converges.\nThe virtuous man stirs not his heart,\nand the vast *hé* *qi* may be nurtured.\nPure whiteness and vastness are alternate names for harmonious *qi*.\nHarmonious *qi* is gentle and weak,\ncapable of mediating Yin and Yang—\nhence it is said harmonious *qi* mediates.\n\nWhat humanity despises are the terms *gū* (孤), *guǎ* (寡), and *bùgǔ* (不谷),\nyet kings and nobles adopt them as titles.\n*Gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ* are terms of gentle weakness and humility—\nwhat the vulgar find objectionable,\nyet the sage and noble take as their own,\nfor this is how they attain royal nobility.\n\nThis follows the harmonious *qi* as mediator,\nreducing the heart’s rigid strength\nto seek benefit in virtue and the Way.\n\nThus, things sometimes benefit when diminished,\nand are diminished when over-benefited.\n\nThere are things that can reduce emotional desires,\nthat do not boast of their own merits,\nand that lower themselves to preserve their essence.\nAs when kings and nobles adopt the titles *gū* (孤), *guǎ* (寡), and *bùgǔ* (不谷),\ntheir humility brings them greater honor and nobility.\nThe vulgar, however, seek only excess and fullness,\nand those who greedily pursue wealth and noble status,\nknowing no restraint, invite ruin and peril.\nThe *Shū* says: *\"Fullness invites loss, humility invites benefit.\"*\nWhen things are diminished by external means,\nit is the Dao’s way that brings true benefit.\nThe Dao’s benefit comes when things are diminished by their own nature.\n\nWhat humanity teaches is also what I teach.\nThe teachings of the world each assert their own *wǒ yì* (我义).\nAs with the hundred schools of thought,\neach establishes its own principles—\nthose whose intent is good are aligned with the sage’s teachings,\nwhile those whose intent is perverse become the arts of *zònghéng* (纵横).\nThe arts of *zònghéng* lead to entrapment by force and violence,\nand one cannot escape their consequences.\nThose who rely on force and violence cannot escape their fate—\nI shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\nGentleness and weakness belong to Yang, the principle of life;\nforce and violence belong to Yin, the principle of death.\nWhen rulers above are forceful and violent,\nthey lose the hearts of their people and meet downfall without delay.\nWhen subjects below are forceful and violence,\nthey are overthrown by the multitude, and ruin is imminent.\nTo *\"not escape their fate\"* means to die before one’s natural end.\n\nThe Master Lao observed the world’s deviation from the Dao\nand wrote these warnings for future generations,\nknowing that those who practice humility and gentleness will thrive,\nwhile those who indulge in greed and violence will perish.\nThus, he recorded these lessons to instruct posterity.\n*\"Father\"* (父) means origin, foundation.\nThe principle of *chōnghé* (冲和) with its humility invites benefit,\nwhile abandoning one’s own *wǒ yì* (我义) in favor of force and violence\nleads to ruin—\nhence, one must adhere to the utmost gentleness.\nTherefore, I follow it with the observation:\n*\"The Dao’s utmost gentleness overcomes the world’s utmost firmness.\"*\n\nThe gentlest thing is water,\nthe firmest are metal and stone.\n*\"Driving\"* (驰骋) describes its ceaseless flow,\nlike a swift steed racing without pause.\nWater, though supremely gentle,\ncan penetrate metal and stone through its use,\nand drown all things—\nthus it is said to *\"drive\"* past the world’s firmest substances.\nThe Dao is without form or boundary,\nyet it can encompass Heaven and Earth without end,\nand invade the minutest hairs without omission.\nHow could anything with form enter its boundless void?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Metal and stone cannot sound without emptiness—*\n*this refers to containing the Dao’s *qi* (气).\"*\nJun Ping remarked:\n*\"Things with form, though sharp, do not enter the formless;\nthe spirit’s wisdom moves within the body,\nemerging without boundary,\nentering without aperture—\nin the span of a breath, it traverses thousands of miles.\"*\nThus, I understand the benefits of *wúwéi* (无为).\n\n*\"I\"* (吾) is the Master Lao’s self-reference.\nThe Way of emptiness and nothingness,\ngentle and formless, yet penetrates all things.\nWang Bi said:\n*\"Nothingness cannot be exhausted,\ngentleness cannot be broken—\nfrom this, one knows the Dao of *wúwéi* (无为) benefits all.\"*\n\nThe teaching of silence and *wúwéi* (无为) is rarely attained.\nThe sage, observing the natural Dao of Heaven,\nadjusts his body and simplifies his actions,\nrefines his bearing and conduct to enlighten others—\nthus his teaching prevails without words.\nIf one resorts to forceful action,\nit leads to stagnation and harm to things.\nYet when one returns to *wúwéi* (无为),\nthe benefits are manifold—\nhence, the Way of quietude and simplicity\nis truly the supreme guardian of the world.\nFew attain it.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"Those who know me are rare—*\n*thus I am precious.\"*\n\nWenzi said:\n*\"Gao Yao sighed and established the great laws,\nand there was no cruelty in the world—\ndoes governance have greater value than words?\"*\nShi Kuang, though blind, became the Grand Steward,\nand the state of Jin knew no disorder—\ndoes administration have greater value than sight?\n\nThe sage’s commands are spoken without utterance,\nhis governance is seen without form—\nthis is how he becomes a teacher.\n\nGentleness and non-competition lie in *wúwéi* (无为).\nThe benefits of *wúwéi* (无为) are closest to one’s own body—\nthus, I follow with: *\"Which is dearer, name or body?\"*\n\nWhich is dearer, name or body?\nThe body is substance, the name is guest—\nto abandon substance for guest is called inversion.\nThe *Liézǐ* says:\n*\"Substance is poor, falsehood is rich;\nto say substance has no name while name has no substance—\nthis is falsehood indeed.\nYet those who chase fame relentlessly—\ncan fame truly be abandoned?\nCan fame truly be treated as a guest?\"*\n\nNow, having a name brings honor,\nlosing it brings disgrace.\nHonor brings ease and pleasure,\ndisgrace brings sorrow and suffering.\nSorrow and suffering harm one’s nature,\nease and pleasure align with it—\nthis is where the matter lies.\nHow can fame be abandoned?\nHow can it be treated as a guest?\nOnly to fear those who cling to fame,\nburdening their substance,\nand neglect the peril of ruin—\nis this not more than the difference between ease and suffering?\n\nBao Jiao extends this reasoning:\nThose who cling to fame and burden substance.\n\nWhich is more: body or wealth?\nWealth refers to resources and possessions.\nAll who dwell in riches and delight in their means of support\nare yet to find one who does not covet wealth.\nThe rich toil endlessly, day and night,\namassing treasure yet unable to enjoy it fully—\ntheir bodies are but external forms.\nThe noble fret through the night and day,\npondering whether their actions are good or bad—\ntheir bodies are but distant shadows.\nThough their halls be filled with gold and jade,\nif they lack virtue and benevolence,\nthey earn only the mockery of thieves and the scorn of those who hoard wealth—\nand when their families fall and their bodies are shamed,\nwhat greater loss is there?\n\nTo gain or to lose—\nwhich brings greater harm?\nFalse fame and fleeting profit\nare as light as a feather,\nwhile the loss of life, body, spirit, and nature\nis as heavy as a great mountain.\nA discerning person weighs which is the greater affliction.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"To nourish one’s will is to forget the body;\nto nourish the body is to forget profit;\nto attain the Dao is to lose the heart—*\n*it is gone.\"*\n\nThus, excessive love brings great depletion,\nand excessive hoarding invites heavy loss.\n*\"Depletion\"* (费) means harm.\n\nHoarding wealth brings ruin,\nfor greed and avarice lead only to self-destruction—\nhow could such folly be called light?\n\nThe contented know no disgrace,\nthe restrained face no peril.\nThus may one endure.\n\n*\"Peril\"* (殆) means ruin.\n\nThe contented do not covet riches.\nWithout coveting riches,\nthey escape the calamities of shame and slaughter.\n\nZhuangzi recounts how Confucius spoke to Yan Hui:\n*\"Your home is poor, your station low—\nwhy do you not seek office?\"*\nYan Hui replied:\n*\"I have no wish to serve.\"*\n\nHe had fifty *mu* of fields outside the city walls,\nenough for rice gruel,\nand ten *mu* within,\nsufficient for silk and hemp.\nPlaying the *qin* brought him joy,\nand what he learned from the Master\nfilled him with delight.\nThus Yan Hui had no wish to serve.\n\nConfucius grew solemn, his expression changing.\n*\"Ah, well said!\nI have long heard that the contented\ndo not burden themselves with profit.\nThose who find true self-sufficiency\nlose nothing and fear no loss,\nwhile those who cultivate virtue within\nact without needing rank.\nNow I see this in you—\nthis is my gain.\"*\n\nThe restrained do not covet fame or station.\nWithout coveting fame or station,\nthey know no fear of ruin or peril.\n\nZhuangzi said:\nYuan Xian lived in Lu,\nin a hut of sun-dried bricks,\nits thatched roof patched with wild grass,\nits doors of woven reeds,\nits windows framed with mulberry branches.\nWithin, two rooms were partitioned with coarse hemp,\nleaking above, damp below—\nyet he sat upright, plucking his strings.\n\nZigong arrived in a grand carriage,\ndrawn by fine horses, draped in white silk,\nso wide the streets could not contain it.\nHe went to visit Yuan Xian,\nwho wore a fine cap and loose sandals,\nleaning on a staff of black bamboo at the door.\n\nZigong exclaimed:\n*\"Ah, Master, what ails you?\"*\nYuan Xian replied:\n*\"Poverty is lack of wealth.\nIllness is knowing but not practicing.\nI am poor, not sick.\"*\n\nZigong hung his head, ashamed.\nYuan Xian laughed:\n*\"To conform to the world’s ways,\nto flatter and fawn in friendship,\nto study for others’ gain,\nto teach for self-aggrandizement—\nthese are the corruptions of *ren* and *yi*,\nlike gilding a horse’s trappings.\nI cannot bear them.\nBut the truly contented and restrained\nneed fear no disgrace, no peril—\nthey endure.\"*\n\nTo cherish the self is to know contentment;\nto distance oneself from fame is to avoid disgrace.\nContentment without disgrace—\nthe Dao is complete, like a broken vessel.\nThus, the greatest completion resembles a flaw.\n\nA vessel with a flaw is never exhausted in use.\n*\"Flaw\"* (缺) means broken;\n*\"exhausted\"* (敝) means ruin, decay.\nThe truly accomplished—those of full virtue—\nthough their forms may seem incomplete,\nare like vessels with flaws:\nrarely discarded, their use never fails.\nThus they preserve their wholeness,\nfree from ruin or decay.\n\nAgain, like the great abyss:\ndraw from it, yet it is never emptied;\nlike a bright mirror:\nreflect all things, yet never obscured.\nThus its use is never exhausted.\n\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nyet its use knows no end.\n*\"Empty\"* (冲) means humble, unassuming.\nThose of vast virtue and achievement\nare modest, not proud;\nthe wealthy in modest dwellings\nare frugal, not extravagant.\nTheir abundance overflows—\nhow could they ever be wanting?\n\nGreat straightness seems bent,\nfor true straightness follows things as they are.\nIt bears grime without complaint,\nits rectitude not its own—\nthus it seems bent.\n\nGreat skill seems clumsy,\nfor true skill follows nature’s course,\ncrafting nothing unnatural—\nthus it seems clumsy.\n\n*The Liezi* tells of a man from Song\nwho carved jade into mulberry leaves,\ntaking three years to perfect them,\nso seamless they blended with the real—\nand thus he fed his skill to Song.\nLiezi heard of this and said:\n*\"If Heaven and Earth took three years\nto grow a single leaf,\nthen few things would bear leaves at all.\"*\nThus the Sage relies on the Dao’s transformation,\nnot on clever artifice.\n\nThe Dao’s transformation—\nthis is true skill:\nfollowing things as they are,\nnot boasting of one’s own power—\nthus it seems clumsy.\n\nGreat eloquence seems tongue-tied,\nfor true eloquence knows no bounds.\nIt speaks as things demand,\nwithout obstruction.\nIf one relies only on one’s own words,\nsome truths may elude it.\nThus it speaks no forbidden laws,\nno unseemly words—\ndoing nothing forced,\nit seems tongue-tied.\n\nVigor conquers cold,\nstillness conquers heat.\n\n*\"Vigor\"* (躁) means movement.\nSpring and summer, the yang qi rises from the earth,\nand all things thrive.\nBut extremes invert—\nat the summer solstice, a single shade of yin appears within.\nWhen movement reaches its peak, cold follows,\nand all things wither.\nThus vigor is the root of decay,\nexcess the origin of decline—\na warning that perfection without flaw must fail,\nthat fullness without emptiness must topple,\nthat rigid vigor must perish.\n\nJun Ping said:\n*\"The movements of Heaven and Earth—\nadvance and retreat—\ngive rise to all things.\nChange is inevitable, unblocked;\nflexibility is inevitable, unobstructed.\nThus when yin reaches its height,\nthe earth splits, ice forms,\nhowling winds rage, frost descends like rocks,\nturtles and tortoises retreat,\nall things curl into balls.\nAt such times,\nthough you dwell in heated chambers,\nstand by blazing fires,\nwear thick fox and badger furs,\nand wrap in fine wool,\nyou cannot ward off the cold.\nBut when the mind is still,\nthe body at ease,\nwhen vitality drains and filth flows—\ncasting aside your clothes,\nstepping outside—\nyou find warmth beyond measure.\"*\n\nStillness conquers heat,\nfor in autumn and winter, the yang qi rests beneath the cold depths.\nWhat is rejected gives rise to what is affirmed—\nat the winter solstice, a single shade of yang appears within.\nHeat then brings forth the harmonious qi,\nand all things are born from it.\nLife arises from stillness—\nthus stillness is both the root of life and its opposite, vigor.\n\nJun Ping said:\n*\"When yang reaches its height,\nsand is boiled, stones melt,\nbirds fall from the sky,\nwater creatures writhe in agony,\nall things wither and dry,\nrivers and streams run low.\nAt such times,\nthough you plunge into deep, cold springs,\nwear thin, loose robes,\nsoar on high towers,\nconsume icy stones—\nyou cannot endure the heat.\"*\n\nWhen the mind is released and the will set free,\nwhen the spirit rests in pristine stillness,\nthe body transcends the four seas’ bounds,\nwhile the will roams where nothingness resides—\nthen the heart is balanced, the qi harmonious,\nand cold is cast aside from the body’s core.\n\nThis speaks of vigor as the root of death,\nstillness as the foundation of life—\nto illustrate the sovereign’s path.\n\nVigor and strength repel foes,\nadorn falsehood, and provoke the nature of things,\nleading to the ruin of family and state—\nthis is called **vigorous strength**,\nwhich brings only stillness and cold decay.\nCold decay brings decline and extinction.\n\nYet **stillness in harmony**—\nwith effortless governance, preserving all things’ truth—\nbrings enduring peace to the realm—\nthis is called **stillness in harmony**,\nwhich brings warmth and human accord,\nand human accord brings prosperity.\n\nPurity and stillness are the right way for all under Heaven.\nThis concludes the meaning of what came before.\n\nThe most refined clarity lies within the turbid,\nyet nothing can obscure it.\nThe most profound stillness dwells amid motion,\nyet no affair can disrupt it.\n\nMoreover, the **Great Completion, Great Fullness, Great Rectitude, Great Skill, Great Binding**—\nthese have their counterparts:\n**not exhausted, not depleted,**\n**as if bent, as if lacking, as if hesitant**—\nyet only **clarity and stillness**\ncan uphold all things\nand stand as the central balance for all under Heaven.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Hold the spirit in stillness, and the form will align itself.\nBe still, be clear—\ndo not weary your body,\ndo not agitate your essence—\nthen you may attain longevity.\"*\n\nWhen the outer is deficient yet the inner is whole,\nthis is called **the Way**.\nThus, it is followed by: *\"All under Heaven has the Way.\"*\n\n**End of *Dao De Jing: Hidden Chamber, Revered Subtlety*, Scroll Six**\n**Begin *Dao De Jing: Hidden Chamber, Compiled Subtlety*, Scroll Seven**\n\n**Begin *Dao De Jing: Hidden Chamber, Compiled Subtlety*, Scroll Seven**\n\nThe **Biqiuzi** Chen Jingyuan compiled:\n\n**The Virtue Classic (De Jing):**\nWhen the Dao prevails under Heaven,\nwarhorses are driven out to till the fields.\n\n*However*, **屏去 (bǐng qù)** means to set aside.\n*And* **治田 (zhì tián)** means to cultivate the land.\n\nWhen the Dao prevails under Heaven,\nthis speaks of a time of **Great Peace (shí tài)**.\nIn times of Great Peace, the people flourish,\nand ancestral temples shine in splendor.\nThe realm is at ease,\nand feudal lords come as honored guests.\nThe seas grow tranquil,\nand arms rest in repose.\nAll turn to the roots of life,\nwith every household striving in agriculture and sericulture.\nThus, warhorses—**the martial prowess (wǔ gōng)**—\nare set aside,\nand the people return to **the common arts (cháng yè)**.\n\nHence, the **Heavenly Heart (Tiān Xīn)** is harmonious and content,\nand all things rejoice in their natural state.\n\nWhen the Dao does not prevail under Heaven,\nwarhorses breed in the **交 (jiāo) [borderlands]**.\n*Here*, **交 (jiāo)** refers to the frontier between two states.\n\nWhen the Dao does not prevail under Heaven,\nthis speaks of a time of **Great Disorder (shí fǒu)**.\nIn times of Great Disorder, official duties are neglected,\nand the sovereign grows anxious.\nThe treasuries are drained,\nand floods and droughts plague the land.\nCounties and districts fall to bandits,\nand the strong oppress the weak.\nAll lose their means of livelihood,\nand the custom of war takes hold.\nNaturally, the **戎骇 (róng hài) [battle]**-horses breed in the borderlands,\nthus **阴阳 (yīn yáng) [the cosmic forces]** are severed and blocked,\nand all living things mourn in sorrow.\n\nNo crime is greater than **可欲 (kě yù)**.\nIf a man has **可尚 (kě shàng) [worthy of reverence]**, **欲爱 (yù ài) [desires to love]**, and **之心 (zhī xīn) [heart]**\nthat crave what is **非理 (fēi lǐ) [unreasonable]**, then his **贪求 (tān qiú) [greed and grasping]**\nwill be like **火驰 (huǒ chí) [wildfire]**, unstoppable and unreturning.\nThus, he who pursues the **秋毫 (qiū háo) [finest hair]**\nloses the **太山 (Tài Shān) [great mountain]**.\nHe who indulges in **侨奢 (qiáo shē) [excessive desires]**\nmust bear the **校之凶 (jiào zhī xiōng) [punishment of calamity]**.\n\nFor the cause of crime, nothing is heavier than this.\n\n*The Liezi* says: A man from Qi desired gold. At dawn, he dressed formally and went to the market, arriving at the place where gold was sold. There, he seized the gold and fled. The sheriff captured him and asked, *\"All were present—why did you seize another’s gold?\"* He replied, *\"When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold. Like gazing into murky water and losing oneself in a clear pool.\"* No greater calamity exists than **unknowing contentment**.\n\nCalamity—harm. Among the things one may desire, even within greed, there are limits. But the unknowingly contented—whatever passes before their eyes, they take nothing, yet their cup overflows without spilling. Ruin and disaster follow, so no calamity surpasses **unknowing contentment**.\n\nNo greater misfortune exists than **desiring to possess**. Misfortune—ruin. Even the things that pass before one’s eyes have bounds. If one desires all under heaven—seen and unseen—and seeks to hoard them all, leaving none untaken, this is the height of **without-Dao**. How could ruin not befall oneself alone? It also brings ruin to future generations.\n\nCrime speaks of transgressing prohibitions. The first offense is called *guilt*; the Daoists call it *overt*. The Classics say: *\"The first offense is guilt, also called error.\"* Error—mistake. To commit error a thousand eight hundred times brings *calamity*, heavier than guilt. To commit error two thousand one hundred sixty times brings *misfortune*, heavier still than calamity. These three are all deeds of **without-Dao**. The small harms the body; the great destroys the state. How could one not take warning?\n\nThus, **knowing contentment’s contentment** is always contentment. Though external things may suffice, if the heart does not know contentment, this is called **unknowing contentment**. Though external things may lack, if the heart remains content, this is called **knowing contentment**.\n\n*The High Sage’s Transmission* says: The strict **Yán Jūn Píng** was friendly with the wealthy man **Luō Chōng** of Shu Commandery. Hearing that Jūn Píng declined an official summons, Chōng asked, *\"Why do you not seek office?\"* Jūn Píng replied, *\"I lack the will to rise.\"* Chōng then prepared carriages, horses, provisions, and attendants. Jūn Píng said, *\"I am ill—it is not lack.\"* *\"I have abundance, yet you have not even a single coin—how can you say you have excess?\"* Chōng retorted. Jūn Píng said, *\"I once lodged in your home. When others slept, your servants labored without rest, day and night, ceaselessly—never content. Now I earn by divination; money comes without effort, and I have tens of thousands in surplus, piled high. I do not know what to do with it. How can you say I have excess while you lack?\"*\n\nChōng withdrew, deceiving himself: *\"He who enriches me diminishes my spirit; he who gives me fame destroys my life. If one truly knows contentment’s contentment, how could **battle-horses breed in the borderlands**, or calamity and misfortune be so heavy?\"*\n\nThe Dao is nowhere absent—why seek it far? Thus, it follows: *\"Do not leave the door, and you know the world.\"* Not leaving the door, one knows the world. The sage’s governance begins with self and heart, measuring near before reaching far. Without descending from the ancestral hall, one knows beyond the four seas. By observing things, one recognizes things; by knowing people, one understands people. When eating, think of the world’s hunger; when clothing, think of the world’s cold. Loving one’s elders reveals the world’s aged; pitying one’s children reveals the world’s young. If such, why leave the door to know the world?\n\n*\"Without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.\"* A man’s seven-foot frame—four limbs, nine orifices, five viscera, six palaces—all contained within. Thus, the original *qi* of the body communicates with the Dao of Heaven. If the ruler preserves form in stillness, the Heavenly *qi* ascends bright and self-corrects. If the ruler indulges in excess desires, the Heavenly *qi* grows dim and turbid. The ruler, sharing virtue with the Two Forces, aligns with the sun and moon in clarity. Leading Heaven, Heaven does not resist; following Heaven, one honors its timing. Without peering through windows or gazing afar, the Dao of Heaven is self-evident.\n\nYán Jūn Píng said: Thus, the sage does not leave the door. Above, he examines parents; below, he measures descendants. Danger, security, profit, and harm return to himself, so he is clear on the sayings of death and life, discerning in right and wrong, comprehending the roots of profit and harm, reaching the foundation of order and chaos. Knowing oneself, one knows the family; knowing the family, one knows others. Affairs grasp their principles; things follow their order. In motion, one knows where to go; in stillness, one knows what to guard. Virtue and power are father; spirit and clarity are mother; stillness and purity are teacher; Great Harmony is friend. The world is home; all things are body. View others as oneself; view oneself as others. The heart dares not stir; the will dares not rise. Abandoning old knowledge, extinguishing the three and five, one does not dwell in cliffs or caves, does not slaughter living things, does not eat raw plants, does not wear unripe fruits, does not pluck before maturity. Heaven, Earth, and all things each preserve their own. This is called, within the unity of the body, modeling Heaven, Earth, and all things.\n\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows. The ruler who loses the Dao cannot model Heaven or walk the Way, yet relies on cleverness to discern things. The farther he seeks, the less he knows. Jūn Píng said: *\"Examining Heaven and Earth, verifying past and present, actions never contradict—thus I know the Dao of Heaven is complete within me.\"* The family is the root of knowing people. The body is the source of knowing Heaven and Earth. To observe the world without the body is to observe people without the family. Near is small, far is great; small knowledge leads to great confusion. Leaving the family and the door, one does not see the world. Leaving the body to peer through windows, one does not know the Dao of Heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows. Wandering the four seas, one is ever more confused. The more one seeks, the greater the pursuit; the greater the pursuit, the smaller the achievement. Without seeing or hearing, seek within oneself. At the juncture of Heaven and man, the Great Dao is complete.\n\nTo govern the realm, first govern one’s own country; to govern one’s country, first govern one’s family; to govern one’s family, first govern one’s self; to govern one’s self, first cultivate one’s heart; to cultivate one’s heart, first rectify one’s intentions.\n\nThus, the virtuous person, if not sincere, will see all things turn against them—this refers to the body and the heart. Therefore, the Sage acts without movement yet knows, does not see yet names.\n\nThe Sage, though not traversing the world, yet discerns human affairs by observing the self within the self and knowing the outer through the inner—this is called *solitary enlightenment*.\n\nThe Sage, though not witnessing celestial omens, yet can name and command the Dao of Heaven by examining the small to comprehend the great, clarifying the near to illuminate the far—this is called *mysterious contemplation*.\n\nThe Sage achieves without action. The Sage transforms the world without contrivance, merely illuminating the natural inclinations of things and following their course.\n\nConfucius said: *\"He who governs without action—is he not Shun?\"*\n\nTo learn is to grow daily, yet the Dao is diminished daily. The Dao grows through learning, but once grown, it must be diminished; knowing the child yet guarding the mother, returning to the origin—this is the root.\n\nReturning to the origin, one must first discard cleverness and grasp the essential. Clinging to the vital and holding fast to the root, the Dao is diminished daily—this is entering the realm of boundless mystery.\n\nDiminish again and again, until one reaches *non-action*. When one acts without contrivance, there is nothing that cannot be achieved.\n\nThe one who diminishes does not force gain nor discard what is extraneous. When one discards until one forgets what is wrong, then there is nothing minute that is not removed. When one removes until one forgets what is right, wrong is not wrong, and right is not right.\n\nHaving diminished what is wrong and what is right, it is said: *\"Diminish again and again.\"* If both right and wrong are forgotten, self-interest naturally vanishes, and nature aligns with the Dao, reaching *non-action*. Once in *non-action*, one does not compete with things, but lets all things follow their own course. Thus, all things are achieved without contrivance.\n\nTo take the world, one must act with *non-interference*. When there are affairs to attend, it is insufficient to take the world. The Sage and the virtuous follow the Dao: first cultivating the self and the heart, then extending to the world.\n\nEarlier, it was said to govern the self through *non-action*; now it is said to govern the world through *non-interference*. Thus, the Sage’s way of thinking is always concerned with one thing’s loss of place, and the key to rectifying flaws and chaos lies in taking the hearts of all under Heaven.\n\nTo take the hearts of all under Heaven, one must use *non-interference* as defense, *non-action* as guidance, and *non-desire* as treasure. When the people naturally transform into simplicity and tranquility, they willingly embrace and do not tire of it.\n\nIf one governs through contrivance and interference, the people will labor under burdensome rule, stand in dread, and criticize in secret. How can one then take the hearts of all under Heaven?\n\nOnce growth leads to diminishment, and diminishment reaches *non-heart*, it is said: *\"The Sage has no fixed heart.\"* The Sage takes the hearts of the people as their own.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao with an empty heart; things respond to their own nature, and since responses are not uniform, the Sage’s heart remains without fixed inclination.\n\nYet the hearts of the people always desire to secure their lives and fulfill their nature. The Sage who lets all people attain what they desire—is he not the one who takes the hearts of the people as their own?\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"The Perfect One’s use of heart is like a balance scale—neither pushing nor pulling, responding without storing. Thus, they can overcome things without harming themselves.\"* The Sage has no fixed heart.\n\nTo those who are good, I am good to them; to those who are not good, I am also good to them—*virtue* is goodness.\n\nThe people have a natural inclination toward goodness. The Sage does not contradict their nature, responding with goodness. Those whose nature is inherently good, the Sage further aids with greater goodness, ensuring their goodness is perfected.\n\nIf there are those whose nature is not good, the Sage still treats them with goodness. Under the influence of the Sage’s *virtue*, their hearts naturally shift toward goodness.\n\nThus, there are none in the world who are not good—this is the Sage’s way of harmonizing with natural inclinations to complete transformation, not forcing things to conform to themselves.\n\nTo those who are trustworthy, I trust them; to those who are not, I also trust them—*virtue* is trust.\n\nThe people have a natural sincerity toward trustworthiness. The Sage does not suppress their resolve, responding with trust. Those whose trust is firm, the Sage aids with greater trust, ensuring their trust is perfected.\n\nIf there are those who are not sincere in their trust, the Sage still treats them with trust. The untrustworthy, influenced by the Sage’s *virtue*, naturally awaken their sincerity into trust.\n\nThus, there are none in the world who are not trustworthy—this is the Sage’s ability to accommodate human nature, not out of love or self-interest.\n\nThe Sage moves through the world with *solemn vigilance*, regulating the hearts of all under Heaven.\n\n*Solemn vigilance* is the appearance of concern and movement, yet never ceasing. *Undivided* means without distinction.\n\nIn ancient times, rulers in the world, though their governance appeared concerned and active, shared in the people’s affairs, yet their hearts remained serene and empty, aligned with nature. Thus, they could embody transformation, harmonize change, and reach nothing that could not be achieved. They balanced all things as one, and nothing was left untransformed.\n\nFor the people of the world, the Sage makes their hearts undivided and their desires unified, follows their nature to harmonize their transformation—who would not willingly embrace this?\n\nTo labor over the mind and exhaust thought, treating affairs as affairs, is to achieve something. Lu Xi-sheng said: *\"When the Sage is present, the world is in awe. Responding to things and their influences, they never cease, yet their heart is undivided, in harmony with all under Heaven. They never have their own agenda.\"*\n\nThus, the four things that Master Zhongni renounced were: *no intentions*, *no absolutes*, *no rigidity*, *no self*.\n\nTherefore, they could achieve *no may or may not* and *no action or inaction*.\n\nThe *Riverbank Master*’s text reads: *\"chùchù\"* (怵怵).\n\nThe *King Pi* version reads: *\"xīxī\"* (歙歙).\n\nThe common people all pour their ears and eyes into [worldly] affairs, while the Sage treats them as children.\n\n*\"Zhù\"* (注) means to pour forth, to apply.\nThe Sage cultivates with *wuwei* as virtue, never opposing the natural inclinations of all things. Thus, the people are bathed in their sacred virtue, each fulfilling their inherent capacities.\n\nThe wise are made to scorn, the perceptive to listen—all pour their ears and eyes into imitating the Sage’s natural Way. Yet the Sage, his crown flowing loose, his gaze distant, his ears blocked, does not strain his body with cleverness nor probe the hidden in things. He cradles the common folk in his thoughts, treating them all as infants—thus it is said: *\"to treat them as children.\"*\n\nWithout fixed intentions, one is undivided. Responding to transformations as a child does, one obscures life and death—hence the next stage: *birth and death*.\n\n**Birth and Death:**\nFrom emptiness arises natural spontaneity; from spontaneity arises the Dao; from the Dao arises *yī qì*—one breath, which transforms and gives rise to all things. Thus it is called *birth*.\nAt the peak of life, transformation renders it formless—thus it is called *entering death*.\nThis is yet confined within the realm of beginning and end.\n\nTo transcend this realm, how could life and death ever bind one?\n\nThere are thirteen categories of those who cling to life, and thirteen of those who court death.\n*\"Tú\"* (徒) means kind, type.\n\nThose who cling to life: those who practice *shèshēng* (摄生) fall into this category.\nThose who court death: those who rush toward death fall into this category.\nThe thirteen: as Han Fei said: four limbs, nine orifices—thirteen in total, their movement and stillness all tied to life and death.\n\nNow, the adept at *shèshēng* does not wastefully gaze, does not wastefully listen, does not wastefully smell, does not wastefully speak, does not wastefully grasp, does not wastefully tread—his movements and stillness are effortless, committing no evil. These are the ranks of those who seek longevity.\n\nThose who court death, however, let their eyes wander over garish colors, their ears indulge in wanton sounds, their noses grow weary of foul odors, their mouths crave what is unrighteous, their hands favor wicked tools, their feet quicken on forbidden paths. Their movements and stillness are drowned in vice, with no virtue remaining—these are the ranks of those near death.\n\nThe roots of life and death all hinge on these thirteen matters.\n\nSun Deng said: Among the things of Heaven and Earth, those that align with nature are few, while those that defy it are many. Thus, in ten cases, only three follow nature.\n\nNow, life not lived in accordance with the Dao, death not met with reason—those who follow life are few, while those who defy death are many. Hence, in death, only three submit to fate.\n\nSome interpret this as: the threefold business of ten evils—those who master and subdue them belong to the ranks of longevity. Those who indulge belong to the ranks of near-death.\n\nBy reasoning through it, the nine orifices and four limbs are the most thoroughly discussed.\nHuman life is a descent into death’s domain through these thirteen matters.\n\nNow, why is it that people’s ordinary actions lead them toward death’s domain?\nIt is because they are seduced by desire for gain.\nThey crave rich flavors, fine silks, beautiful colors, pleasing sounds—all to indulge the nine orifices and four limbs. Thus their movements are strained, as if compelled against their will, yet they fall into death’s domain without knowing it. None escape the thirteen matters.\n\nWhy is this?\nBecause those who advance life excessively do so at the expense of their own substance.\n*\"Shēngshēng\"* (生生) means to further life.\nTo forget life’s weight upon oneself is to hope for longevity, while to advance life at one’s own expense is to draw near death’s domain.\n\nMoreover, to advance life must first rely on external things. Though external things suffice to preserve the body and delight the nature, serving as means for prolonged life, yet those who forget themselves in their greed for wealth overreach in seeking life-preserving things, letting the thirteen matters slide into chaos and hastening themselves toward death’s domain.\n\nIt is said that the adept at *shèshēng* does not speak of *shèshēng*—*\"swēi wén\"* (盖闻) is a humble phrase.\n*\"Shè\"* means to guard. Within guarding life, they grasp its subtleties, hence the adept at *shèshēng*.\nTraveling on foot, they avoid rhinoceros and tigers; entering battle, they wear no armor.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to strike with its horn, the tiger no place to strike with its claws, weapons no place to lodge their blades.\nThey meet without design.\n\n「The rhinoceros emerges from the southern banks of the Xiang River, its hue a deep azure-black, its form resembling a wild ox, with a single horn weighing a thousand *jīn* [~220 lbs].\n\nThe adept at *shèshēng* [guarding life] attains internally to the self, so all illnesses fail to arise. Externally, they harmonize with things, so all calamities cannot befall them. When they abandon all selfish gain, they naturally meet with fortune.\n\nOf all the harms that tools bring, none surpass the sword and spear. Among beasts, none are fiercer than the tiger and rhinoceros. Thus, though the sword and spear stand before them, they are not alarmed—this is because there is no place for their blades to lodge. Though tiger and rhinoceros block their path, they are not startled—this is because there is no place for their claws and horns to strike. Hence, though all calamities assail the sentient, they cannot harm the unsentient.\n\nWhy is this? Asking why all calamities do not assail and spare the adept at *shèshēng* [guarding life]—it is because they have no place of death.\n\nThe supreme person does not indulge their inner desires, nor do they harbor outward harm toward things. Thus, they can forget the self while the self remains, for they have no place of death.\n\nZhuangzi said: Those who grasp the Dao/Way must reach *lǐ* [principle/reason], those who reach principle must discern *quán* [opportunity/strategic measure], and those who discern opportunity will not let external things harm them. The virtuous/powerful ones are not scorched by fire, drowned by water, harmed by cold or heat, or preyed upon by birds and beasts—not because they are callous, but because they perceive danger and safety, rest in calamity and blessing, and are cautious in departure and approach. None can harm them.\n\nTo die is to lose the Dao/Way; to awaken is for the Dao/Way to arise. Thus, it follows with *dào shēng zhī* [the Dao/Way giving birth to it].\n\nThe Dao/Way gives birth to it, and virtue/power nurtures it. The Dao/Way is the essence of emptiness. Virtue/power is the function of nature. The Dao/Way’s essence is emptiness, yet through movement it gives rise to things. All things receive *qi* from the Dao/Way, hence it is said to give birth to them.\n\nVirtue/power’s function is natural, encompassing and nurturing things. Things take form from virtue/power, hence it is said to nurture them.\n\nThings are shaped by their form, and their fate is completed by their circumstances. All creatures and plants are rooted in the Dao/Way and born, sustained by virtue/power, and when their material is fully formed, they take shape, hence it is said to shape them.\n\nOnce things have taken form, they follow the changes of the four seasons to reach completion. Thus, all things cannot but revere the Dao/Way and honor virtue/power.\n\nThe Dao/Way descends as pure essence, giving birth to the nature of things. Virtue/power contains harmonious *qi*, nurturing the form of things. Hence, all things revere and honor the Dao/Way as if it were their father, and virtue/power as if it were their mother.\n\nThe reverence of the Dao/Way and the honor of virtue/power—none can confer rank upon them, yet they are always naturally present. Rank is the bestowal of command. The example of this is the titles of duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron.\n\nThe reason the world holds things in reverence and honor is because the sovereigns bestow rank and command upon them. Yet the Dao/Way, with its pure essence, gives birth to things, and all things naturally revere it like a father. Virtue/power, with its harmonious *qi*, nurtures things, and all things naturally honor it like a mother.\n\nAll things universally receive the Dao/Way’s and virtue/power’s nurturing and completing functions, revering and honoring them as if they were parents—not because of conferred rank, but because they are always naturally present and have the power to guard and subdue.\n\nThus, the Dao/Way gives birth to it, nurtures it, lengthens it, educates it, completes it, ripens it, sustains it, and protects it. Earlier, it spoke of the Dao/Way giving birth and virtue/power nurturing, but here it does not mention virtue/power, for the Dao/Way permeates all without omission.\n\nTo receive its essence is to be born, to contain its *qi* is to nurture, to fulfill its form is to lengthen, to refine its nature is to educate, to aid its function is to complete, to bring it to its end is to ripen, to preserve its harmony is to sustain, and to guard its injuries is to protect. These eight are the fundamental functions of the Great Dao/Way. Even the most minute of creatures—those that dart and creep—cannot escape its reverence and honor.\n\nBorn yet not possessed, acting yet not relying, lengthening yet not ruling—this is called *Xuán Dé* [Mysterious Virtue/Power]. This concludes the eight meanings above.\n\nIf the Dao/Way were said to give birth to all things as if it had possession, then its benevolence would be diminished. If it were said to nurture all things as if relying on its actions, then it would claim its function. If it were said to lengthen and educate all things, completing and ripening all types, sustaining and protecting all creatures and plants, as if it were proud of its rule—then it would be seen as presuming its length. With these attributes yet remaining hidden in secrecy, one can say its mysterious virtue/power is profound and distant.\n\nThe Dao/Way gives birth and virtue/power nurtures, providing things with their beginning. Thus, it follows with *tiānxià yǒu shǐ* [the world having a beginning].\n\nThe world having a beginning, the Dao/Way is the mother of the world. Once one has obtained its mother, one knows its child. The beginning is the Dao/Way, the root, the nameless.\n\nThe mother is nurturing, the named. The Dao/Way externally encompasses Heaven and Earth, internally fills the cosmos. All things draw upon it to be born and follow it to reach completion. That which completes is the child, that which gives birth is the mother.\n\nThe child is the One, and the One is the *chōngqì* [primordial breath], the Dao/Way’s child. The Dao/Way is the body of true essence, and the One is the function of wondrous things. Once the Dao/Way’s body is obtained, one knows the wondrous function. Body and function are interdependent, merging in the ultimate emptiness.\n\nHaving known the child, one again guards the mother. Thus, throughout life, one is unharmed. Having known the wondrous function of things, one again guards the true essence of the Dao/Way. Body and function become indistinguishably one, responding to stimuli without end, and only then can one act without doing and achieve all without action—thus, throughout life, one is unharmed.\n\nClose its *duì* [joyous/pleasure], shut its gates—then one will labor not a day in their life. This illustrates the practice of cutting off desire and guarding the mother.\n\n*Duì* means delight. It refers to the ears and eyes delighting in sounds and colors, the nose and mouth delighting in scents and flavors. The six senses each have their delights, and gates signify the paths of entry and exit.\n\nThe ears, eyes, and all the senses are the means by which dust and defilements enter. If one seals the gates of love and delight, then misfortune ceases and the body does not toil.\n\nAgain, *duì* is the eyes. If one closes the insatiable gaze, then all scenes will be cut off. Gates are the rivers. If one stops the mouth that speaks excessively, then all calamities will not approach.\n\nWhen all scenes are cut off, the source of desires is sealed. When all calamities cease, the path to action is closed. Thus, one will be tranquil and at ease, laboring not a day in their life.\n\nOpen its *duì* [joyous/pleasure], and its affairs will flourish—yet one’s life will never be saved. If one does not guard the mother Dao/Way, opening the source of love and delight without sealing it, then the emotions of desire will grow ever longer.»\n\nIf the path of calamities is left open and not closed, then the affairs of misfortune will flourish. Thus, one will face sorrow, suffering, peril, and death, and never be saved.\n\nTo perceive the small is called clarity; to uphold softness is called strength. This is called preventing before sprouting, governing before chaos arises.\n\nWhen calamities and chaos have not yet appeared, they are small—yet clearly visible, that is clarity. If one knows the arts of sealing *duì* and closing the gates, then one sees the subtle and minute.\n\nDulling the sharpness of desires and dissolving the turmoil of calamities—this is upholding softness and weakness. To uphold softness and weakness means that things cannot overpower one; this is called strength. To see the subtle and minute means that affairs cannot become obscured; this is called clarity.\n\nEmploy its luminosity, and return to its clarity. Luminosity is the illumination of wisdom. Wisdom arises externally, externally shines, and is ever in motion—motion is the function of things. Clarity is insightful understanding. Insight dwells internally, internally reflects, and remains ever still—stillness is one’s true nature. When wisdom shines outward, it responds to affairs; when it returns, it aligns with principle. Thus, function returns to essence, and it is said: *return to its clarity*.\n\nThis is a further elucidation of perceiving the small and upholding softness, causing the external to cease and the internal to return. To leave no harm to the self is called *clinging to the constant*.\n\n*Heru* (遗) means to bestow or to leave behind. If affairs and principle are both clear, essence and function merge in obscurity, and one does not enslave wisdom’s external illumination while guarding insight’s internal reflection—returning desires before they sprout and restoring them to the primal Mother Dao—then there will be no self-inflicted harm, and this is called *secretly employing the constant Dao*.\n\nTo have a beginning and an end, to know the Child while guarding the Mother, to seal and close love and delight—is this not the upright and discerning? Thus, it follows with: *If one makes the upright and discerning have knowledge*.\n\nIf the upright and discerning have knowledge, walking the Great Dao, only their actions are to be feared. *Jie* (介) means solitary, upright, and resolute. Alas, if in this age one does not follow the ancient Dao, then it is said: *If one makes the solitary and resolute scholar have knowledge of governance, then they will walk the Great Dao*.\n\nThe Great Dao is the Way of effortless clarity, utmost fairness, and utmost straightforwardness. Yet those who walk the Dao must have actions. If actions are simple and easy, they guide the people toward the realm of clarity. If actions are convoluted and vexing, they lead the people toward greed and filth.\n\nOnly actions are to be feared—feared that they do not conform to the ancient Dao. The Great Dao is exceedingly smooth, yet people love shortcuts. The Great Dao is exceedingly smooth, like a grand thoroughfare. A grand thoroughfare is level and easy, reaching everywhere without obstruction, for its vast straightness does not fear minor detours. Yet people desire speed, seeking shortcuts, and thus become entangled in rugged paths, lost and confused, never reaching their destination.\n\nTherefore, the Ancient Sage lamented this, cautioning only the methods of instruction, making them feared, and guiding the people along the broad path—referring to the following passage.\n\nThe palace halls are excessively cleared,\nThe fields are overgrown with weeds,\nThe granaries are empty,\nYet adornments are worn,\nFine silks and embroidered patterns are displayed,\nSharp swords are carried,\nBeasts are fed sumptuous foods,\nAnd wealth and goods abound.\n\nHan Fei commented: *\"Resource and goods are in excess.\"*\n\nEnter a land, and its governance and teachings become apparent.\n\nObserve the palace halls meticulously maintained, the walls and halls elaborately carved and towering—then one knows the sovereign delights in grand construction and indulges in frivolous pleasures. Observe the fields overgrown with weeds, agriculture neglected—then one knows the sovereign relishes forced labor, seizing the people’s time. Observe the granaries empty, farmers starving—then one knows the sovereign favors frivolous pursuits while abandoning essential livelihoods. Observe garments adorned with excessive embroidery, substance abandoned for superficial ornamentation—then one knows the sovereign indulges in licentious craftsmanship and exploits female labor. Observe belts adorned with sharp swords, valorized strength and martial competition—then one knows the sovereign cherishes martial prowess while neglecting governance. Observe feasts rejecting plain fare, savoring rich meats and fresh kills—then one knows the sovereign revels in gluttony and forgets state affairs. Observe wealth and goods in surplus, hoarding rare treasures—then one knows the sovereign amasses riches, impoverishing the people.\n\nConfucius said: *\"If the people lack, how can the sovereign suffice?\"*\nIf plunder continues unchecked, the people’s strength will be exhausted—this is not the Dao of the Sage.\nThis is called *robberious boasting*, not the Way.\n\nThe seven misdeeds above all rely on deceitful expansion, seizing the people covertly without principle—thus, they are theft. Already thieves, yet they still boast grandly—hence, *robberious boasting* is not the Way.\nThis is what is meant by *\"only instruction should be feared\"*—here lies its proof.\n\nThose who know the Way and practice it well have virtue that cannot be undermined by teaching, hence the next step: establishing what cannot be uprooted.\nThose who establish well cannot be uprooted—*establish* means *to stand firm*. Those who stand firm in the Way, rooting their person and nation, first solidify their foundation before cultivating their branches, thus their roots run deep and their branches flourish, making them unshakable.\n\nThose who embrace well do not lose—*lose* means *to depart*. *Separate* means *to detach*. Those who embrace the people with the Way have them loyal and undetected. Those who embrace the primal unity with the Way preserve their spirit whole and unlost. Their descendants’ sacrifices know no end.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and virtue becomes true.\nCultivate it in the family, and virtue abounds.\nCultivate it in the village, and virtue endures.\nCultivate it in the nation, and virtue flourishes.\nCultivate it in the world, and virtue is universal.\nThese five stages begin with self-cultivation and extend to the world.\n\nTo cultivate the Way in the self: the heart is at ease, nature joyful, *qi* nurtured, spirit nourished, desires few and private concerns minimal—thus life is prolonged, years extended, and one becomes a True Person.\n\nTo cultivate the Way in the family: fathers are benevolent, sons filial, brothers harmonious, younger siblings obedient, husbands trustworthy, wives virtuous—nine clans in concord, blessings flowing to future generations.\n\nTo cultivate the Way in the village: the aged are honored, the young cared for, the ignorant instructed—people united, ruler and subjects in trust, virtue enduring.\n\nTo cultivate the Way in the nation: natural joy arises, officials fulfill their duties, calamities and chaos do not arise, all treasures abundant—thus all things are plentiful.\n\nTo cultivate the Way in the world: transformation occurs without speech, governance without teaching—effortless, harmonious, universally inclusive—neighborhoods may be ennobled, influence reaching distant lands, virtue extending universally.\n\nThus, observe the self with the self, the family with the family, the village with the village, the nation with the nation, the world with the world.\n*Observe* means *to scrutinize*.\nReflect on the Sage’s methods of self-cultivation to examine one’s own heart and mind—if one’s heart and mind embody the Way, then virtue becomes true.\nReflect on the Sage’s methods of family governance to examine one’s household—if one’s family harmonizes with kin, then virtue abounds.\nReflect on the Sage’s methods of village governance to examine one’s neighbors—if one’s community trusts in friendship, then virtue endures.\nReflect on the Sage’s methods of national governance to examine one’s people—if one’s people thrive, then virtue flourishes.\nReflect on the Sage’s methods of world governance to examine the world’s people—if the world’s people are without desire, without knowledge, then virtue is universal.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus? By this.\nThe Ancient Sage spoke: *\"How do I know that those aligned with the Way prosper while those who abandon it perish?\"*\nThe answer: By the five observations I have laid out, scrutinized in reflection—thus I know.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"Without leaving one’s door, one knows the world.\"*\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Observe my life, observe the people.\"*—is this not its meaning?\n\nTo establish oneself and one’s nation with the Way, virtue extending to the world—how profound their contained virtue must be! Hence, next follows: *the depth of contained virtue*.\n\n---\n*The Daoist Classic of Authentic Virtue: Hidden Mysteries, Volume Seven*\n*The Daoist Classic of Authentic Virtue: Compiled Mysteries, Volume Eight*\n\n**The Daoist Classic of Authentic Virtue: Contained Virtue’s Depth**\n\n**Chapter on the Depth of Contained Virtue**\n\nThe Master of Azure Emptiness, Chen Jingyuan, compiled:\n*\"The Depth of Contained Virtue\"*—\n**Contained virtue is like that of the infant.**\n\n*Contained* means *to cherish within*.\nThe Perfect One is pure and unadulterated, his virtue deep and profound. His emotions return to their original nature, his desires extinguished—his form stands serene, like that of an infant.\n\nThe infant is taken as the epitome of pure harmony.\nPoisonous creatures do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, raptors do not strike.\n\n*Poisonous creatures*—scorpions, wasps, and fireflies—sting with their tail tips.\n*Fierce beasts*—tigers and leopards—seize with claw and fist.\n*Raptors*—hawks and eagles—strike with talon and beak.\n\nThe Perfect One is divine—his essence lost and regained like the infant’s unknowing heart, so his spirit remains whole and nothing can harm him.\n\nMaster Yan Junping said:\nThe infant, as a thing,\nknows yet does not manifest,\nis aware yet does not reach,\nis capable yet does not act,\nis skilled yet appears clumsy,\nlives yet seems dead,\nis new yet seems worn,\nacts without acting,\nharmonizes with the Dao’s completeness—\nlife without life,\nbody without body,\nuse without use,\nhearing without hearing,\ndoing nothing yet nothing undone,\nno intention, no mind,\nseeking neither virtue nor power,\naccumulating no spirit,\nthinking not at all,\nyet no obstruction or burden,\nspirit and qi unattached,\ncleverness without knowledge,\nsoft and weak, yet empty and still,\nsoul and spirit undisturbed,\njoying joy without joy,\nresting in desire without desire,\nneither wasting life nor bending will—\nthus he can embrace the Dao and contain virtue,\naligning with Heaven and Earth.\nSo wasps and serpents sting without malice,\nraptors and beasts attack without intent.\n\nHis bones are weak, his sinews soft, yet his grip is firm.\nThe infant’s perfect harmony illustrates the Perfect One’s pure virtue—\nbefore knowing joy or anger, his clenched fist is unbreakable,\nfor his true nature is singular and undivided.\n\nBefore knowing union with male and female, his essence flows freely—\n*essence* is the infant’s vital source.\nThe infant’s desires have not yet stirred; his innate virtue moves spontaneously,\nas the Perfect One’s breath circulates without obstruction,\nand all desires fail to intrude.\n\n[*Essence flows* was originally written as *fullness*.]\nMaster Wang Bi said:\n*Flow* means *to grow*—\nunharmed by external things, he remains whole and thrives.\n\nThe *Upper Clarity Scripture of True Perfection* says:\nWhen a person is born,\nhe receives Heaven’s and Earth’s qi as spirit and form,\nand the Primordial One’s qi as fluid and essence.\nWhen Heaven’s qi is exhausted, the spirit scatters.\nWhen Earth’s qi is exhausted, the body falls ill.\nWhen the Primordial qi is exhausted, life ends.\nThus the Emperor’s method of returning to the Origin\nreverses the flow of the hundred vessels,\nsupplementing the muddy nine [organs],\nfilling the brain so the spirit is whole,\nthe spirit whole so the body is whole.\nWhen the body is whole, the hundred passages are regulated within,\nevil qi vanishes without,\nmarrow solidifies into bone,\nintestines transform into sinews—\npure and unmixed, eternal life is attained.\n\nHe cries all day yet his voice does not grow hoarse—\nthis is harmony perfected.\n*Crying* is *weeping*.\nWhen weeping reaches its extreme, the voice fails—*hoarse*—\nor becomes raspy.\nThe infant weeps endlessly, yet his throat does not tire or scatter,\nfor Heaven’s harmonizing qi is fully present.\nThus the True One’s breath aligns with *la* and *wa*—\nharmony is complete.\n\nKnowing harmony is constancy;\nknowing constancy is clarity.\nThe infant’s full harmony is true—\nthe Perfect One values harmony as the constant way,\nso knowing constancy does not change,\nand guarding it brings self-illumination.\nThis is the depth of contained virtue.\n\nMaster Du Guangting said:\nThe Five Constants are all present in harmony—\nwhen a person’s body is harmonized, virtue is complete and he attains truth;\nwhen a nation is harmonized, its transformation spreads and its blessings endure;\nwhen among the people, harmony brings ritual alignment;\nwhen leading armies, harmony ensures victory.\nGreat is the meaning of harmony!\nThis is knowing harmony and constancy,\nso virtue is whole and self-illuminating.\n\n*Beneficial days* bring auspiciousness;\nthe heart directing qi brings strength.\n*Auspiciousness* is the omen of good or ill.\nOnce formed, one’s inherent nature is fixed—\nno artificial enhancement will bring fortune;\nonly ruin follows.\nMaster Zhuangzi said:\n*\"One should follow nature without artificial aid.\"*\n\nThe heart has right and wrong, yet qi has no discrimination—\ntrusting qi brings softness and weakness,\ntrusting the heart brings rigidity and force.\nMoreover, will can move qi, and qi can move will—\nwhen the heart directs qi, qi grows strong and the heart rigid.\nMaster Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Do not listen with the heart, but with qi—\nthis is the heart directing qi,\nwhich benefits life but misleads the Dao.\"*\n\nWhen things grow strong, they age—\nthis is called *not the Way*.\n*Not the Way* brings early decay.\nWhen things reach their peak, they wither and grow old.\nWhen the heart grows strong, it turns violent and cruel.\nYet the Way employs softness and weakness—\nto wield strength and rigidity as the heart is *not the Way*.\nThus the Ancient Sage warned:\n*\"The path of not the Way—\nbetter to stop early.\"*\n*Stop* is *death*.\nHe who does not walk the Way dies young.\n\nVirtue is deep, still, and silent—\nenlightened, yet speechless—\nthus follows: *The Wise Do Not Speak*.\n\nThe Wise do not speak;\nthose who speak are not Wise.\nThe Wise know the Dao with the heart, not with words,\nvaluing action over speech.\nThose who discuss the Dao rely on words, not the heart—\nthey lose the Dao yet keep their talk.\n\nMaster Yan Junping said:\nFive tastes are in the mouth, five notes in the ear—\nyet what is sweet is not sweet,\nwhat is bitter is not bitter,\nwhat is *shang* is not *shang*,\nwhat is *yu* is not *yu*—\nyet Yi Ya and Shi Kuang could distinguish them.\nHow? Because the mouth cannot speak.\nIf taste and sound are thus,\nhow much more the subtle Dao!\n\nMaster Zhuangzi said:\nWhen the Wise traveled north, he was asked three times—\nhe answered *\"Do nothing\"* yet gave no reply,\nnot because he refused to answer,\nbut because he did not know how.\nHis intent aligns with this.\n\nThe *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\nThe Dao is natural—\nthose who practice attain it,\nthose who hear can speak,\nbut the Wise do not speak.\nThose who speak do not know.\nThey speak to be heard by sound—\nthus, those who discuss the Dao with words\nare merely making noise.\n\n「The unknowing trouble others with words,\nyet those who do not hear do not speak—\nthey do not know how to begin.\n\n· For instance, those who know the music\ndiscern the sound by the strings,\nyet though their heart understands the tune,\ntheir mouth cannot convey it.\nThe Dao is profound and subtle—\nthe knowing do not speak.\nWhen the sound of music brings sorrow,\none suppresses the external note\nand lets the heart speak—\nyet the speaker does not know.\nThis is the case for those who can act and speak.\n\nPlug its *yuè* [口], shut its gate—\nthis is similar in wording to Chapter 52,\nyet differs in meaning.\nThere, it restrains the Dao by quietude,\nto block the roots of cravings and desires;\nhere, it upholds the Dao’s wordlessness,\nthus advocating the blunting of hearing and discarding of sight.\n\nThe Dao is formless—\nit cannot be seen with the eyes,\nit cannot be spoken with the mouth;\nthus the heart is perplexed,\nknowing not how to grasp it,\nand the mouth is silenced,\nunable to discuss it.\nThis is why the Perfect One\ndoes not need to block sight or close the gate—\nhis nature is inherently so.\n\nDull its sharpness,\nresolve its confusion,\nblend its brightness,\nequalize its dust—\nthese principles have already been stated in Chapter 4,\nyet there, they were applied to the Dao to discuss its efficacy,\nwhile here, they are grounded in human conduct to clarify practice.\n\nThe Perfect One, in harmony with Heaven’s intent yet without knowledge,\naligns with the Dao’s essence yet lacks form—\nthus, the heart of sharpness and confusion,\nwhere would it arise from?\nThe mind of distinction and separation,\nwhere would it be born?\n\nThis is called *Xuántóng* [玄同].\n\nThe Perfect One’s movements and dwellings:\nWhen manifest, he shares the root with all things;\nwhen obscure, he blends with emptiness and nothingness.\nThus, his words and silences adapt to the times without deviation,\nand his spontaneous speech follows the sun’s rising to respond to change—\nthis is called *Xuántóng* [玄同].\n\nThus, he cannot be approached or distanced,\ncannot be swayed for gain or harm,\ncannot be honored or slighted—\nyet for this reason, he is honored by all under Heaven.\nHe interacts with the Dao above without excess,\nand though the world praises him, he is not emboldened—\nthus, he cannot be approached.\nHe deals with affairs below without impropriety,\nand though the world condemns him, he is not disheartened—\nthus, he cannot be distanced.\nHis *dànpō* [澹泊] is without force,\nhis adherence to *fèn* [分] is contented—\nthus, he cannot be enticed by profit.\nThough in lowly stations he is not humiliated,\nand though in ugliness he does not contend—\nthus, he cannot be trapped by harm.\nRank and reward cannot sully him,\npower and influence cannot sway him—\nhow could he be held in esteem?\nLosing his resolve does not bend him,\ndwelling in poverty makes him only more serene—\nhow could he be deemed base?\n\nThe Perfect One practices these six virtues:\nhe does not prosper in fame nor suffer in obscurity,\nbears no Heaven’s resentment nor man’s blame,\nis not burdened by things nor haunted by ghosts’ reproach—\nthus, he is honored by all under Heaven.\n\n· When one governs himself without coercion,\nthen he governs things naturally—\nthis is *zhèng* [政], the next stage is *zhèngzhì* [政治] to govern the state.\nTo govern the state with *zhèngzhì* [政治],\nto use unconventional strategies in warfare,\nto take the world with *wúshì* [無事]—\n*wúshì* [無事] means *wúwéi* [無為].\n\nThe *zhèng* [政] of the *zhèngzhì* [政治] ruler,\nwho relies on governance and instruction,\nthough the people may not be extravagant,\ntheir exhaustion and decline grow ever deeper.\nOnce the traces of governance are made clear,\nhow could such rule endure long?\n\nThe *bàwáng* [霸王] ruler,\nwho employs cunning strategies in warfare,\nthough the state may not topple,\nmisfortunes and chaos accumulate daily.\nResentment and longing multiply—\nhow could such rule remain firmly established?\n\nThe ruler with the Dao,\nwho seeks to win the world’s heart\nand establish an enduring legacy,\nfinds nothing better than *wúshì* [無事].\nThus, Chapter 48 states:\n*\"To win the world, one must rely on wúshì [無事];\nwhen one resorts to governance,\nit is insufficient to win the world.\"*\nThis is the Master Lao’s teaching\non the way to govern the world in great peace.\n\n*Zhèng* [政] is written as *zhèng* [正] in the *Héshàng* [河上] edition.\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nFrom this [text].\n\nThe Master Lao does not dare claim these words as his own,\nthus he cites the Sage’s saying:\n\nSome say the Master Lao was the historian beneath the pillars of Zhou,\nwho surveyed the ancient texts of the Three *Fèn* [坟] and Old Scriptures.\nHence, he cites them to verify his point.\n\n*\"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI take no action, yet the people grow rich.\"*\n\nThe Master Lao continues:\n\n*\"I love stillness, and the people align themselves;\nI have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nI—this is the self-designation of the sovereign in an age of governance—\nspeaks of how I, without action, follow the Dao,\nmaking no alterations, allowing the people to live as they will,\ntheir customs transforming naturally.\n\nI, without interference or disturbance,\nfrugal in my expenditures,\nthe people enrich their livelihoods,\ntheir households prospering naturally.\n\nI remain quiet and unspoken,\nguarding myself in humility and fear,\nthe people embrace the harmony of Heaven,\ntheir customs pure and upright.\n\nI, without desire, am empty and void,\ndiscarding ornamentation and honoring the root,\nthe people do not seek vain ambition,\ntheir nature returning to simplicity.\n\nIf I act or desire,\nyet hope to lead the people to wealth and longevity,\nI have never seen such a possibility.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet speak not,\nthe four seasons shine with clear principles yet debate not,\nall things follow their natural laws yet are not explained.\"*\n\nThe Sage, thus,\noriginates from Heaven and Earth’s beauty,\npenetrates the principles of all things.\nHence, the Perfect One acts without interference,\nthe Great Sage does without contrivance—\nthis is called observing the Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *Héshàng* edition further states:\n*\"I have no emotions, and the people remain pure.\"*\nThe annotation reads:\n*\"By cultivating the Dao and guarding the True,\nsevering the Six Emotions,\nthe people naturally follow me in purity.\"*\n\nIn governing the state and transforming the people,\nnothing surpasses *wúshì* [無事].\nWhen *wúshì* [無事] is practiced,\nits governance is expansive and relaxed—\nthus, it follows with *\"its governance is dim and tranquil.\"*\n\nIts governance dim and tranquil,\nits people are sincere and virtuous.\nThe *Kāiyuán* Imperial commentary says:\n*\"Dim and tranquil—without contrivance, expansively relaxed.\nSincere and virtuous—unadorned, thick with integrity.\"*\nThis means the sovereign without action,\nwhose governance is broad and lenient,\nallows things to follow their natural course,\nwhose laws are not harsh or violent,\nthus their customs become sincere and virtuous,\ndwelling in purity and stillness,\never growing in integrity.\n\nThe ancient text reads *zhèngzhèng* [偆偆], but Wang Bi renders it as *chúnchún* [惇惇].\nIts governance is sharp and probing,\nits people are depleted and scattered.\nThe *Kāiyuán* Imperial commentary says:\n*\"Sharp and probing—with contrivance, strict and urgent.\nDepleted and scattered—withered, impoverished, and dispersed.\"*\nThis means the sovereign with contrivance,\nwhose governance is stern and urgent,\nbinds the people with laws,\nwhose decrees grow ever more explicit—\nthieves and robbers multiply,\nthus the people wither and disperse,\nevery movement entangled in prohibitions,\nfearing and avoiding them,\ntheir moral cultivation daily more ruined and deficient.\n\nDisaster, oh! Fortune depends upon it;\nfortune, oh! Disaster lurks within it—\nwho can know its limit?\n*Yī* [倚] means \"to rely upon\";\n*fú* [伏] means \"to conceal.\"\n\nThe dim and tranquil governance,\nthough the world calls it lax,\nyet the people are sincere and virtuous—\ntruly, they find joy in it.\n\nThe sharp and probing governance,\nthough the world calls it capable,\nyet the people are depleted and scattered—\ntruly, they find sorrow in it.\n\nWhat the world calls disaster,\nnone but rejoice in it—\nfear brings caution,\nand fortune arises from within.\n\nWhat the world calls fortune,\nnone but fear it—\njoy brings arrogance,\nand disaster hides within.\n\nDisaster and fortune rely upon and conceal each other—\nnone can fathom their ultimate bounds.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth have their moments of rest and activity,\nthe sun and moon their waxing and waning—\nthis is the law of relying and concealing.\n\nDisaster hides within fortune:\nif fortune brings arrogance,\nthen disaster arrives.\nFortune conceals disaster within:\nif disaster brings caution,\nthen fortune comes.\nThis is how the world operates.\n\nHence, the sovereign of the Dao,\nguards it with purity and stillness,\ntrusts it to unfold naturally,\ndoes not profit from wealth or treasure,\ndoes not seek proximity to the noble and rich,\ndoes not delight in longevity,\ndoes not grieve over early death,\ndoes not glorify the open and flourishing,\ndoes not despise obscurity and want—\nthus, disaster and fortune rely upon and conceal each other in what way?\n\nThere is no right or wrong in this.\n\nDisaster and fortune rely upon and conceal each other—\nhow could there be no right or wrong?\nIt lies in whether the sovereign of the Dao\nacts without interference or contrivance,\nforgets form and substance,\nand only then does it become right.\nIf one deliberately seeks to make it right,\nthat rightness will surely become strange.\nIf one deliberately seeks to do good,\nthat goodness will surely become unnatural.\n\nRightness becomes strange,\ngoodness becomes unnatural.\n\nThe hearts of the people are not singular.\nThe sovereign of the Dao,\nuses his heart like a balance—\nneither pushing nor inviting,\nresponding without seizing,\nthus he can master all things without harming them.\n\nIf he enforces rightness upon what is not right,\nthat rightness will be strange.\nIf he enforces goodness upon what is not good,\nthat goodness will be unnatural.\nIf he allows things to naturally become right and good,\nthen disaster and fortune will not be perverse,\nbut will rely upon and conceal each other.\n\nThe people’s confusion is long-standing.\nThe shallow customs cannot naturally become right and good,\nyet they force truth into rightness,\nreverse nature into goodness,\nand thus become strange and unnatural—\nbewildered and unaware,\ntheir origin of confusion is indeed long.\n\nThe *Xīshēng Jīng* [西升经] states:\n*\"To enforce rightness is to find no place—\nrightness naturally returns to itself.\nIt does not receive what is perverse,\nthus perverse *qi* departs—\nthis is called the Dao naturally aiding.\"*\n\nHence, the Sage is square yet does not cut,\nthe sovereign of the Dao\nis square and upright in himself,\nallowing things to awaken by themselves,\nnot enforcing his own square and upright upon them,\nlest they follow him while losing their nature.\n\nHe is frugal yet not impure.\n*Lián* [廉] means \"clean\";\n*huì* [秽] means \"impure.\"\nThe sovereign of the Dao,\nfollows his nature in cleanliness and frugality,\nallows things to transform naturally,\nnot using his own purity to flaunt others’ impurity,\nbut merely letting things know to encourage\nand wash away the impure.\n\nThe ancient text reads *chuàng* [创], meaning \"to harm.\"\nThis means the Sage is generous in himself,\nyet does not punish others to cause harm.\n\nHe is straightforward yet not domineering.\n*Shì* [肆] means \"to apply force.\"\nThe sovereign of the Dao,\ninherits a straightforward and honest *qi*,\ntakes responsibility without bending,\nyet does not impose his own directness\nto forcefully apply or provoke upon others—\nthis is akin to great directness appearing as bending.\n\nHe shines yet does not dazzle.\n*Guāng* [光] means \"enlightened and wise.\"\nThe sovereign of the Dao,\nis enlightened and wise, his discernment radiant,\nyet also preserves and conceals himself,\nnot using his own strong wisdom\nto dazzle and overwhelm others,\nlest they be extinguished.\n\nFrom this point onward,\nall are examples of dim and tranquil governance,\nnot sharp and probing rule.\n\nWhen governance is expansive, the people are fortunate;\nwhen rule is strict, the people suffer disaster—\ndisaster and fortune rely upon and conceal each other,\noriginating from the people and from Heaven—\nthus, it follows with *\"the affairs of the people and the response to Heaven.\"*\n\nTo govern the people and serve Heaven,\nnothing surpasses frugality.\nFrugality is love.\n\nThe common folk dissipate their *qi* through excessive desires,\npursuing luxury yet never satisfied,\nwhile the Sage cherishes *qi*, restrains expenditure,\nand lives with moderation—thus having abundance.\nTherefore, the ruler who governs without action,\nmaintaining clarity, tranquility, and simplicity,\nreduces the people’s burdens,\nfills the granaries and armories,\nand teaches them propriety—\nthen preserves their vitality and loves their *qi*,\npurifies sacrifices, and rejects extravagance,\nso that both humanity and the divine are in harmony.\nThus it is said: *nothing surpasses frugality.*\n\nOnly through frugality is it called *early service*;\nrestraining expenditure without luxury,\nmoderating desires while cherishing *qi* and spirit—\nthis is to align with the Dao.\nThe Sage, before calamity or fortune manifests,\nconstantly aligns with the Dao—\nthis is called *early service.*\n\n*Early service* is called *heavily accumulating virtue*;\nto economize the people’s wealth,\ncherish *qi* and spirit,\nand thus serve the Celestial—\nthis is one virtue.\nAgain, by *early service* to the Dao,\nbringing harmony between humanity and the divine,\nit is called *heavily accumulating virtue.*\n\n*Heavily accumulating virtue* means nothing is unconquered;\nthe one who *heavily accumulates virtue*\ncan rule over the people,\nand all under Heaven will turn and revere him—\nnone will fail to submit.\nIf nothing is unconquered,\nthen its limits are unknown;\nif none fail to submit,\nthen all things transform and are civilized,\nand virtue and the Dao are boundless—\nthus its limits are unknown.\n\nIf its limits are unknown,\nthen one can have a realm;\nhe whose virtue and Dao are boundless\nwill place himself last yet be first,\nset himself aside yet endure—\nall under Heaven will joyfully follow without tiring,\nand thus can be the sovereign of a land.\n\nIn days past, Master Gēngsāng resided on the slopes of Yǔshān.\nFor three years, his people knew no sickness or plague,\nand their grain stores overflowed.\nThey whispered among themselves:\n*\"When Master Gēngsāng first arrived,\nwe were struck by his difference.\nNow, when we calculate daily, we lack nothing,\nand when we calculate yearly, we have abundance—\ncould he be a Sage?\"*\n*\"Shall we then sacrifice to him as a spirit,\nand enshrine him as a deity?\"*\nThis is what is meant by:\n*\"Virtue and the Dao have no limits,\nand thus one can have a realm.\"*\n\n「The mother of a realm, one may endure long;\nThe mother of a realm refers to the accumulation of virtue.\nVirtue can nurture the people abundantly—\nwhen the people are prosperous and rich,\nthen the altars of soil and grain (*shèqì*) may endure long.\nThis is called the Dao/Way of deep roots and firm stems,\nof enduring life and lasting vision.\nRoots are the foundation;\nstems are the flower’s base.\nHe who cultivates fruit trees,\nwhen their roots are deep, their stems are firm—\neven if great winds arise,\nthey cannot uproot the foundation\nnor shake the fruit from its place.\nThus, deep roots yield flourishing branches,\nand firm stems ensure the fruit does not fall—\nthis is what is called enduring long.\n\nThe ruler who accumulates virtue,\nin governing people and serving Heaven,\nnourishes his land and sustains his people—\nplants his roots in *wuwei* (non-action),\nand secures his stems in *qīngjìng* (serene tranquility).\nThen the altars of soil and grain extend far,\nand this is called enduring life;\nhis reign is ever bright,\nand this is called lasting vision.\n\nDu Guāngtíng said:\nThose who cultivate the Dao/Way,\nharmonize their spirit and body,\naccumulate *qi* and preserve their wholeness,\nfortify their inner gates (*sānjiān*) while relaxing all concerns—\nall spirits submit in order,\nall affairs proceed in harmony,\ntransformation knows no bounds,\nand their years are long and enduring.\nTheir stems are rooted in the *Hùnyuán* (Primordial Domain),\ntheir roots run deep in the *Wúhé* (Land of No-Where),\nand they stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Nine Elders and Seven Ancients.\n\nThe ancient text read: *\"deep roots and firm stems\"* (*shēnguì*).\nServing Heaven and accumulating virtue,\none may have a realm—\nthus it follows with governing great states.\n\nGoverning great states is like cooking small fish.\nTo govern a realm of ten thousand chariots (*wànshèng zhī guó*),\nis like cooking a fish of mere inches—\nadjusting the water and fire,\nletting it cook naturally, then it is whole and perfect.\nAgitate it, and the fish is harmed;\nthe fish harmed, it rots and decays.\nA skilled ruler nurtures his people,\nharmonizing his governance and teachings,\nletting them find their own way—\nthen they are naturally at ease.\nDisturb them, and the people are harmed;\nthe people harmed, they grow chaotic and rebellious.\n\nWhen the Dao/Way permeates all under Heaven,\nits spirits are not fearsome.\nThe Sage employs the *wuwei* Dao/Way of serene tranquility,\nand as he moves through the world,\nhis harmonizing *qi* spreads across all lands—\nin valleys, valleys are full;\nin ravines, ravines are full.\nThus winds and rains come in season,\nfloods and droughts do not arise,\nhuman hearts remain natural,\nand no one seeks false blessings.\nThough spirits and deities exist,\nthey dare not display their fearsome transformations.\nThe *Xīshēng Jīng* says:\n*\"This is the Dao/Way of natural assistance—\nnot skilled in ritual sacrifice (*cí*),\nyet spirits flee of their own accord.\"*\n\nSpirits are the essence of transformation.\nIt is not that their spirits are not fearsome,\nbut that their fearsome transformations do not harm the people.\nIt is not that their spirits lack transformation,\nbut that their fearsome changes cease and vanish.\nThis arises from the people not making disorder—\nthen calamities and disasters (*qìxiáng*) how could they emerge?\nWhen people uphold their constant virtue,\nspirits’ fearsome transformations have no cause to harm the people—\nthis is the natural order.\nIt is not that the spirits do not harm the people,\nnor that the Sage harms the people.\nTheir spirits, though fearsome, do not harm the people,\nbecause the Sage’s *wuwei* and serene tranquility\nmove the spirits and deities to sense his radiant virtue,\nand they themselves regulate their shadowy essences (*yīnlíng*).\n\nThe words of *Lièzi* on the Sage’s governance:\nHe neither gives nor bestows favors,\nyet all things find sufficiency;\nhe neither hoards nor collects,\nyet nothing is lacking.\nThe harmony of *yin* and *yang* is constant,\nthe sun and moon shine eternally,\nthe four seasons follow their course,\nwinds and rains are ever balanced,\nthe people are nurtured in time,\nthe land yields abundant harvests,\nthe soil knows no erosion,\nthe people no untimely deaths,\nthe world no sickness or plague,\nand the spirits no fearsome manifestations.\n\nFor the two do not harm each other,\ntheir virtues return in harmony.\nThe two are the Sage and the spirits.\nHé Shànggōng said:\nThe two do not harm each other—\npeople are governed by the *yang*,\nspirits by the *yin*;\npeople preserve their lives,\nspirits preserve their spirits—\nthus their virtues return in harmony.\nMoreover, when the ruler can preserve the spirits,\nthe spirits can bless the ruler—\nand this is called the return of virtue.\n\nDu Guāngtíng said:\nThe people are the foundation of the state;\nwhen the foundation is firm, the state is secure.\nThe people are the masters of the spirits;\nwhen the master is at peace, the spirits are content.\nThe Sage governs through the Dao/Way—\nsince he does not harm people or spirits,\nthe spirits, moved by the Sage’s achievements,\nalso do not harm the world.\nThe two take joy in each other,\ntheir virtues return in harmony.\n\nGreat states govern through serene tranquility to secure the small,\nthus it follows with the small states beneath them.\n\nGreat states are the lowest currents (*xiàliú*),\nthe confluence of all under Heaven.\nThe seas and rivers can be kings of all valleys\nbecause they excel in descending;\ngreat states can be emperors of all lands\nbecause they excel in humility and descending—\nthus they are where all under Heaven’s subjects gather.\n\nThe confluence of all under Heaven is female (*pín*),\nfor the female ever conquers the male through tranquility,\nand the female is ever the descending one.\n\n*(Continuing from the previous text:)*\nThe great state’s excellence in descending\nis what makes it the confluence of all under Heaven.\n\nThe great state, though mighty, forgets its might—\nthus no small state escapes its embrace.\nIn high position yet humble in descent,\nit does not rely on coercive force or arms—\nso neighboring states submit in gentleness,\nall willingly becoming its servants and subjects,\nthus winning the small states’ affection.\n\nYán Jūnping said:\nThe enlightened kings and sage rulers,\nwhen governing great states,\nbestow without expecting return,\ndescend without demanding obedience—\nthey enfold the lands of all feudal lords (*zhūhóu*)\nyet none dare to fear them;\ntheir virtue encompasses the strength of all feudal lords,\nyet none dare to resist them.\nThey lower their station to align with others’ intentions,\nprioritizing loyalty, integrity, and sincere trust,\nholding scholars and worthies in esteem—\nthey cede land to attract virtuous talent,\nencourage agriculture and weaving to amass wealth,\nemploy alliances and counter-alliances to guard against unforeseen threats,\nopen their granaries and distribute wealth,\nsupport the aged and care for orphans,\nrelieve the poor and aid the distressed—\nthey honor reclusive worthies,\nbestowing gifts yet not seizing them,\ngranting authority yet not claiming it,\npracticing gentleness and simplicity,\nemploying *wuwei* in governance.\nThough feudal lords may be greedy, cruel, or arrogant,\nrelying on brute force or their own might,\nthey are still subdued by the weight of the great state’s virtue—\nwhen it descends in tranquility and humility,\nthose rulers regulate their conduct,\nreform their errors,\ncede land and offer treasures,\nrisk their lives to pledge allegiance,\nand beg to be made vassals of its borderlands or tributary states.\nThus they win the hearts of the small states.»\n\nThe small state submits to the great state, and thus takes the great state’s authority.\nThe small state dwells in its smallness yet forgets its smallness,\nso there is no great state it cannot dominate—\nhumble and reverent in its lowly position,\nnot indulging in arrogance or contempt,\nthus neighboring states comfort and assist it,\nall desiring to aid it—\nthis is how it seizes the great state’s might and prestige.\n\nMencius said:\nOnly the virtuous can act with greatness toward the small,\nthus Tang served Ge Bo, and King Wen served Kun Yi.\nOnly the wise can act with smallness toward the great,\nthus Taiwang served Xuanchuang, and Goujian served Wu.\n\nThose who act with greatness toward the small are joyful in Heaven’s will.\nThose who act with smallness toward the great fear Heaven’s will.\nJoyful in Heaven’s will, they preserve the world.\nFearful of Heaven’s will, they preserve their own state.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"Fear Heaven’s might, and in its time, you shall be preserved.\"*\nThis is from the *Zhou Preface*,\npraising King Cheng’s fear of Heaven’s might,\nand his ability to secure lasting peace.\n\nYan Junping said:\n*\"When in a weak and small position,\nmove according to the Way, follow virtue without fail,\nact with sincerity and loyalty,\nvalue simplicity and till the fields,\nharmony between ruler and people,\nthe ruler as the heart within the body,\nthe people as limbs to the body—\nunified in purpose, they can die together.\"*\n\nEven if the great state’s ruler\nis burdened by strength, wields authority,\npossesses virtue, and practices benevolence,\nhis heart like a hungry tiger, his wrath like a surging spring—\nyet if he aligns with Heaven’s will,\ngains the people’s favor,\nearns the trust of ministers and neighbors,\nunleashes the hidden might of his enemies,\nhumbles himself in body and spirit,\noffers sincere allegiance,\nand governs with quiet clarity—\nthen his spirit is moved, his resolve shaken,\nhis anger dissipates, his misfortunes shift,\nand he pledges fealty to you.\n\nThus, sometimes submission takes authority,\nsometimes submission seizes authority.\nThis is ambiguous phrasing.\n*\"Taking\"* refers to the superior taking through humility,\nsubduing with meekness to win the people’s favor.\n*\"Seizing\"* refers to submission to gain authority,\nobeying with reverence to secure the great state’s power.\nThis is mutual reciprocity through righteousness.\n\nThe great state does not exceed its bounds,\ndesiring only to nurture all under its sway.\nThe great state’s ruler,\nelevating humility and honoring reverence,\nrefining himself through rites and law,\nsubduing the small states—\ndoes he truly harbor greedy ambitions,\nseeking to annex and hoard the small states’ people?\nHe merely upholds the constant virtue of humility and reverence.\n\nThe small state does not exceed its bounds,\nseeking only to serve others.\nThe small state’s ruler,\npreserving loyalty and obedience,\nrefining himself through institutions—\ndoes he truly harbor excessive desires,\npretending to serve the great state’s people?\nHe only holds firm to self-preservation,\nguarding his inherent virtue.\n\nBoth attain what they desire,\nso the great state ought to submit.\nThe great and small states,\neach content with their portion,\nmutually upholding their due,\nwithout encroachment—\nthis is *\"settled in their place, content with their customs,\"*\nneighboring states visible yet distant,\ntheir roosters and dogs heard but never seen,\ntheir people dying of old age without ever meeting.\n\nYet the small state’s submission is the constant of ritual.\nThe great state’s humility is truly complete sincerity.\n\nThe great state ought to submit—\nurging deeply, making it enduring and steadfast,\nthus securing the world’s alliances.\n\nThe great state’s humility contains the essence of the Way.\nThe Way is the deepest essence of all things.\nEssence means hidden, obscure, contained.\nThe Way encompasses all things without exclusion,\nits origins most profound, most hidden—\nthe fundamental root of all existence,\nwith nothing escaping its protection.\n\nThe *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\n*\"The Way is profound and hidden,\na boundless void—\nspeaking of the Way as the refuge of all things,\nnothing not contained within it.\nFrom the lofty dome of heaven to the vast earth,\nfrom the sun and moon’s radiance to the finest of life—\nall draw sustenance from the Way,\nobscurely relying on its shelter.\"*\n\nThe virtuous man’s treasure,\nthe wicked man’s refuge.\nThe virtuous man—\nthe superior sage—\nhears the Way and diligently practices it,\nrefining his essence and nurturing his spirit,\nascending with lightness and ease,\nfirmly guarding the wondrous root,\nmaking it his enduring treasure.\n\nThe wicked man—\nthe inferior sage—\nhears the Way and scoffs at it,\nuntil he encounters its contrary and stumbles into misfortune,\nthen longs to return to fortune,\nseeking the Way’s protection once more.\n\nBeautiful speech can be sold,\nnoble conduct can elevate one.\nThis explains the wicked man’s refuge.\nSweet words find favor everywhere—\neven the most cunning merchant’s schemes\nare met with eager agreement.\nHow could they compare to sincere speech,\ndull and flavorless, dismissed without thought?\n\nNoble conduct commands respect—\nnowhere can it be ignored,\neven the lowest traveler knows its worth.\nHow could it be likened to vulgar ways,\nor whitewashed as shame?\n\nThus, even those without speech or conduct,\nborrowing sweet words and noble deeds,\ncan win over crowds and rise above the masses—\nhow much more so those who embody the Way!\n\nWhy abandon those who are unvirtuous?\nEven the deceitful and false,\nrelying on beautiful speech and noble conduct,\ncan please the multitude—\nhow much more so the Way, which can be leaned upon for refuge.\nFrom this, how can one say the unvirtuous shall always remain so?\nOnly fearing transformation’s reach—\nwhy abandon them at all?\n\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established,\nand the Three Ministers appointed.\nHeaven entrusts its Way to the ruler,\ncommanding him to transform the unvirtuous.\nThe ruler, fearing transformation may be incomplete,\nfurther appoints the Three Ministers to assist him.\n\nDu Guangting said:\n*\"The vastness of the Four Seas,\nthe abundance of all things—\nat their origin, humanity could not exist without governance,\nthus the Son of Heaven is established to nurture them,\nrevering Heaven and Earth as father and mother,\nand is called the Son of Heaven.\"*\n\nOne ruler cannot govern alone—\nthus officials are appointed to oversee him,\nand among them, the Three Ministers stand supreme.\n*The Book of Documents* and *The Rites of Zhou* declare:\n*\"It is the Three Ministers alone\nwho discuss the Dao and govern the realm.\"*\n\nThe Three Ministers—\nthe Grand Marshal (太尉), Grand Tutor (司徒), and Grand Minister of Works (司空)—\nassist the Son of Heaven,\nregulate yin and yang,\ncherish the myriad people,\nand broaden the teachings of the Way.\nEven if one offers a jade *guangbi* as tribute before four-horse chariots,\nit is not as valuable as presenting this Dao.\n\nDu Guangting explains:\n*\"Two hands clasped form the gesture of 'guang' (拱).\nThe *bi* (璧) is a ceremonial jade.\nThe *guangbi* is the largest of jades.\nFour horses harnessed together pull a single carriage.\nIn ancient times, when feudal lords paid homage to the Son of Heaven,\nassembled at great states, or visited small ones,\nor met in the wilds,\nwhen two rulers faced each other,\nthey observed the ritual of presenting tribute first—\nleading with gifts and currency, called 'advancing' (先).\nNow, the Three Ministers should prioritize discussing the Dao\nand governing the realm.\nEven if they wished to offer four-horse chariots and great jades to the ruler,\nit would still be the duty of subjects.\nSuch gifts only benefit licentious extravagance,\nbut contribute nothing to governance.\nIt is far better to advance the Dao of *wuwei* (無為) and serene stillness\nto transform the world—\nso that the unvirtuous turn to goodness,\nthe unrepentant change their hearts,\nand the Way’s transformation spreads universally,\nwhile imperial virtue extends far and wide.\nWhat need is there for jades or horses?\"*\n\nScholars who pursue learning\nvalue an inch of time over a foot of jade—\nhow much more so the ruler who embodies the Dao?\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?\nBecause it is the Dao of *wuwei* and serene stillness.\n\nSomeone asks: *\"What did the ancients mean by valuing this Dao?\"*\nDid they not say:\n*\"Seek and you shall obtain,\ncommit guilt and you shall be absolved\"*?\nThus, it is held in high regard by all under Heaven.\n\nThe subtlety of the Dao\nbegins with enlightenment within the mind and body,\nand ultimately illuminates the cosmos beyond.\nIts mysteries penetrate the formless void,\nwhile its unfolding fills the boundless expanse.\nTo embody it is to perfect oneself,\nto apply it is to benefit the world.\nThough it may not be said *\"seek and you shall obtain,\"*\nit cannot be neglected.\n\nTo obtain it without seeking is to attain it naturally.\nIf attained naturally, why need the Three Ministers at all?\nThus, it is not *\"seek and you shall obtain,\"*\nbut rather *\"seek and you shall obtain\"*—\na principle the ancients held constant.\nThose who comprehend this constant Way\nshall have no guilt to bear.\n\nIf one were to stray from the Dao and commit a fault,\nby amending one’s errors and returning to the Way of *wuwei* and serene stillness,\none may yet avoid disgrace.\nThe original text reads: *\"Did they not say 'seek and you shall obtain'?\"*\nYan Junping’s version states: *\"Obtain it without seeking.\"*\n\nThe profound mysteries of attaining the Dao\nlie in acting without action—\nthus it is called *wuwei*.\nTo do without doing,\nto act without laboring,\nto taste without indulging—\nthe Perfect One does nothing,\nyet lets things act of themselves.\nThings act of themselves, yet there is no doing without doing.\nStill, the Perfect One’s heart never stirs.\n\nTo labor without toil is to let things manage their own affairs.\nThings manage their own affairs, yet there is no labor without labor.\nStill, the Perfect One’s body never wearies.\n\nTo taste without desire is to follow the essence of things.\nThings follow their own essence, yet there is no taste without taste.\nStill, the Perfect One’s palate never craves.\n\nIf the heart remains undisturbed, clarity is boundless.\nIf the body labors not, substance is profound.\nIf the mouth desires nothing, tranquility endures.\nIf tranquility endures, vital essence flows without end.\n\nAnother interpretation of *\"taste without taste\"*:\nIt is not the speech of beauty or ugliness,\nbut the speech of the Great Dao’s flavorlessness.\nThe Classic says:\n*\"When the Dao issues from the mouth,\nits taste is faint and without flavor.\"*\n\nGreat or small, much or little—\nrewarding resentment with virtue.\nPeople say there are great and small matters in the world,\nand that human affairs range from much to little.\nThey say that all actions diminish one’s true nature\nand stray from spontaneity.\nDiminishing true nature breeds resentment,\nstraying from spontaneity spawns malice.\nResentment and malice together\nare the stages of calamity and chaos.\n\nOnly the Perfect One, with *wuwei*, *wuwei*, and *wuwei*,\ncan extinguish the heart and wither the body.\nEven if there are resentments from those who act,\nthey are all met with the Perfect One’s heartless, boundless virtue.\nSomeone asks: *\"If one has virtue, how does one repay it?\"*\nThe world’s affairs—great or small, much or little—\nits anger, resentment, kindness, and virtue—\nare all repaid with the Perfect One’s heartless, boundless virtue.\n\nLu Xisheng says:\n*\"Those who embody the Dao are profound and boundless,\nresponding to the world while rooted in *wuwei*,\nattending to affairs while rooted in *wuwei*,\ntasting without indulgence while rooted in *wuwei*.\nThough their form may be vast, their essence is simple and small.\nThough their deeds may be many, their essence is subtle and few.\nThus, they flourish in simplicity and stillness,\nunshaken by all things.\"*\n\nOnly thus can there be no desires,\nno desires mean no selfishness,\nkindness is the accumulation of selfishness,\nresentment is the seed of kindness.\nOnly the Sage can have no selfish desires,\nno selfish desires mean no selfish kindness,\nno selfish kindness means no selfish resentment.\nCommon people are not so—\nbecause they have selfish desires,\nthey have kindness and resentment.\n\nYet those under Heaven who harbor resentment,\nthe Sage repays them with virtue.\nThose who act unvirtuously,\nthe Sage cultivates them with virtue.\nThus, the people live in harmony,\nand ruler and ruled have no resentment—\nthis is what is meant.\n\nZhongni said:\n*\"To walk the Way fully under Heaven is to have no resentment.\nHow could the Sage harbor resentment toward anything?\"*\n\nPlan for difficulty when it is easy,\nact on greatness when it is small.\nDifficulty and ease, greatness and smallness—\nthese are the world’s great and small matters.\nRight and wrong, beauty and ugliness,\nresentment and anger, kindness and virtue—\nall arise from subtle beginnings.\nNone do not begin as easy and end as difficult,\nor start as small and become great.\nIf one plans at the time of ease,\nthere will be no difficulty at the end.\nIf one acts at the time of smallness,\nthere will be no greatness later.\n\nBut if one waits until difficulty arises,\nor acts when greatness is already upon them,\nresentment deepens and calamities accumulate.\nTo then seek to dissolve difficulty and untangle chaos—\nis it not difficult?\n\nThe great difficulties of the world must be undertaken when they are easy.\nThe great affairs of the world must be addressed when they are small.\n\nFor arduous tasks, they must arise from ease—\none must plan for them when they are still easy.\nFor weighty matters, they begin in subtlety—\none must act upon them when they are still minute.\n\nThe myriad types of affairs are too numerous to enumerate,\nthus the world is spoken of in general terms.\n\nYan Junping said:\nWhen great difficulty is about to arise,\nit is like a malicious wind entering a person.\nBefore it manifests, if one is cautious and prevents its coming,\nit remains at the skin and hair—\nboiling with soup can dispel it.\nWhen it penetrates to the sinews and veins,\na fine needle can extract it.\nWhen it reaches the organs,\nhundreds of medicines can remove it.\nWhen it sinks to the marrow,\neven Heaven and Earth cannot transform it,\nand the processes of creation cannot cure it.\nThus it is said: the world’s great difficulties begin in ease.\n\nWhen great affairs are about to emerge,\nthey are like water issuing from a mountain—\nfirst appearing as dampness and droplets,\nthen flowing ceaselessly, gathering into streams and valleys.\nTherefore, the Sage never seeks greatness directly,\nand thus achieves true greatness.\n\nThe earlier passage spoke of those who lose the Dao,\nwho delight in difficult and great affairs,\nand thus often meet with ruin.\nHere, it cites the Sage’s refusal to seek greatness—\nthe utmost caution toward subtleties.\n\nThe Sage does not pursue difficult and great affairs,\nyet does not remain idle—\neasy, simple, and effortless,\nthus able to accomplish enduring and vast undertakings.\n\nYan Junping said:\nThe Sage’s establishment of merit and fame is subtle,\nthus able to reveal the hidden,\nthus able to illuminate the small,\nthus able to achieve great concealment,\nthus able to manifest intent—\ndwelling beneath the common people,\nyet becoming a ruler of kings.\n\nLight promises bring few fulfillments.\nMany easinesses bring many difficulties.\nThose who speak without threefold deliberation,\nlightly granting promises,\nengage in many affairs yet cannot keep their word.\nThose who do not plan at the beginning but are cautious at the end,\nwho act lightly,\naccumulate difficulties and face unpredictable changes.\nHow could one not be cautious?\n\nThus the Sage treats even these matters with difficulty,\nand so ultimately faces no difficulty.\n\nWith the Sage’s talent and virtue,\nthey still find difficulty in small and easy matters—\nhow much more so for those without the Sage’s talent and virtue,\nwho neglect them?\n\nThus, the common world accumulates burdens,\nwhile the Sage ultimately faces no difficulty.\n\nYan Junping said:\nThe Sage’s heart is silent and unmoved,\ntheir mouth silent and unspoken,\ntheir eyes silent and unseeing,\ntheir ears silent and unhearing.\nIn motion, they are like Heaven and Earth;\nin stillness, like spirits and gods.\nThey act without doing,\nspeak without words.\nAdvancing, they are invincible;\nretreating, they are unexhausted.\nTheir body knows no minor worries,\ntheir realm knows no trifling calamities.\n\nThe tranquility of non-action\nmust come from simplicity and ease,\nthus it is followed by its stability and ease of maintenance.\n\n*[End of Chapter Eight: Hidden Treasures of the Daoist Canon—*Mùwēi* Scroll]*\n*[Beginning of Chapter Nine: Compiled Subtleties of the Daoist Canon—*Zuǎnwēi* Scroll]*\n\n**Chapter Nine: Compiled Subtleties of the Daoist Canon—*Zuǎnwēi* Scroll**\n\nBi Xuzi Chen Jingyuan compiled:\n\nThe *Dao* of **virtue/power** is easy to maintain when its roots are deep,\nits troubles yet unseen are easy to plan against,\nits frailty is easy to break,\nits subtlety is easy to disperse.\n\nAct upon it **before its emergence**,\nFor when a realm is yet at peace and quiet,\nit is easy to preserve and uphold.\nBut when it nears collapse and peril,\nthen guarding it becomes difficult.\n\nWhen wickedness has not yet taken form,\nit is easy to plot its eradication.\nBut when its evil shape is already manifest,\nits annihilation becomes hard to achieve.\n\nWhen the seeds of misfortune are tender,\nthey are easy to uproot and destroy.\nBut when branches and trunks have grown,\nhow can one strike them down?\n\nWhen regret and sorrow are but faint traces,\nworries and anxieties are easy to dispel.\nBut when calamity has already revealed itself,\nits disaster cannot be undone.\n\nThe original text reads: *\"its frailty is easy to judge\"* (or *\"to disperse\"*).\n**Act upon it before its emergence**—this means to **modify and remove** it beforehand.\n\nWhen a realm has not yet fallen into peril,\nand wickedness has not yet sprouted,\nif one preemptively guards against it,\nthen what misfortune could arise?\n\n**Prevent disorder before it begins.**\n*\"Prevent\"* here means **to rescue**.\n\nWhen the seeds of misfortune have not yet taken root,\nand calamity has not yet attached itself,\nif rescue comes first,\nthen no great harm shall arise.\n\nYan Junping said:\nA person not yet sick is easy to heal,\na realm not yet in danger is easy to counsel,\na sprouting affliction is easy to address,\na small, weak misfortune is easy to dispel.\n\nHow does this work?\nA cart with a single wheel missing can be guided by a child.\nBut when it has overturned and toppled,\na thousand men cannot restore it.\n\nA fledgling bird, not yet able to fly,\ncan be stopped with a mere finger’s touch.\nBut when it has become a wild goose,\nsoaring with wings above the clouds,\nno net or snare can capture it.\n\nA newborn beast, still nursing,\ncan be bound with a single rope.\nBut when it has grown into a tiger,\nseizing leather and devouring cattle and horses,\nswords and spears cannot threaten it,\nnets and traps cannot restrain it.\n\nThus, a single drop of water\ncan swell into vast oceans,\na small serpent, if not slain,\nbecomes a divine dragon.\nAccumulated goodness leads to auspicious fortune,\nwhile unchecked evil eventually brings ruin.\n\nA tree of a thousand arms begins from a tiny sprout,\na nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth,\na journey of a thousand miles starts beneath one’s feet.\n\nThese three things illustrate\nthe failure to heed early warnings and subtle signs,\nleading to later calamities.\n\nMisfortune not preemptively guarded against,\nevil not gradually checked,\nis like planting a tree.\nAt first, it grows from a tiny sprout,\nwhich can be pulled out and destroyed.\nBut when it has reached a girth of embrace,\nits roots are deep in the shadowed cliffs,\nits branches stretch toward the sunlit peaks,\na hundred feet tall, blocking the sun and moon—\nhow can it be felled?\n\nThis shows **evil arising from one’s own nature**.\nAgain, like building a tower:\nit begins with a single basket of earth,\nwhich can be kicked away and ruined.\nBut when it has risen to nine tiers,\nsoaring a hundred *rèn* high,\nmatching the grandeur of hills and valleys—\nhow can it be demolished?\n\nThis shows **evil formed through accumulated habits**.\nAgain, like a traveler setting out:\nthey begin with a single step,\nwhich can be turned back with a mere pivot of the heel.\nBut when they have gone a thousand miles,\nlong rivers stretch endlessly,\ntowering mountains rise steep and vast,\npaths narrow and treacherous,\nroads winding and forked—\nhow can they return?\n\nThis shows **a journey gone too far to halt**.\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"Treading on frost, the solid ice is near\"*—this is what it means.\nNine tiers (originally *\"nine layers\"*), the ancient text reads *\"nine stages\"*.\n\nThose who act **meet ruin**,\nthose who grasp **meet loss**.\nTo act beyond necessity brings natural decay,\nto act within desire **diminishes vitality**.\nYet those who cling to power and love fame\nsuffer loss unto their own lives,\nthose who value courage and delight in conflict\ninvite disaster upon their realms—\nall because they cannot act **before its emergence**,\ncannot rescue **before disorder begins**.\n\nThus, the Sage acts not, and so meets no ruin;\ndoes not grasp, and so meets no loss.\n\nWhere things fail, failure comes from action—\nhow could non-action bring failure?\nWhere intentions falter, loss comes from grasping—\nhow could non-grasping bring loss?\n\nTherefore, the Sage directs their mind\nnot toward petty achievements,\nbut always toward **emptiness, tranquility, serenity, and stillness**,\nand **non-action**—\nnaturally without action,\nwithout grasping,\nwithout ruin,\nwithout loss.\n\nZhuangzi said:\nThe Emperor of the Southern Sea was named **Tao**,\nthe Emperor of the Northern Sea was named **Hu**,\nand the Emperor of the Central Sea was **Hun Dun**.\nTao and Hu once met in the land of Hun Dun.\nHun Dun treated them with great kindness.\nSoon, Tao and Hu plotted to repay Hun Dun’s virtue,\nsaying: *\"All people have seven orifices\nfor seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing,\nbut this one has none—\nlet us drill some for them!\"*\nEach day they drilled one orifice,\nand on the seventh day, Hun Dun died—\nthis is proof that **action brings ruin**.\n\nThe people’s undertakings\noften fail when nearly complete.\n*\"Near\"* means **close at hand**.\n\nThe common folk, though they may begin with virtuous deeds,\nyet have no completion—\nthey act first, then grow weary.\nWhen their undertakings are nearly finished,\nthey neglect caution and vigilance,\nand thus meet with ruin.\n\n**To be as diligent at the end as at the beginning**\nis the way to avoid failure.\nThis is a repeated admonition and exhortation.\n\nIf the common folk could **preserve their initial diligence to the end**,\nall their endeavors would succeed.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"Though all may have a beginning,\nfew attain the end.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage desires not to desire,\nand does not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures—\ntreasures such as gold, jade, pearls, and rhinoceros horn.\n\nThe common folk regard **not desiring** as a burden,\nwhile the Sage finds it a joy.\nThe Sage values **tranquility, moderation, and self-restraint**,\nwhile the common folk value **greed, selfishness, and extravagance**.\nTherefore, what the common folk do not desire,\nthe Sage does desire—\nand thus regards gold and jade as discarded soil.\n\n**To not study when one should study**\nis to repeat the errors of the masses.\nThe common folk **strain their innate nature** to pursue external learning,\nand thus lose their **inherent true nature**.\nThe Sage **nurtures spontaneity without studying**,\nand preserves the **harmony of their innate constitution**.\n\nYet the common folk consider **not studying** a fault,\nwhile the Sage regards **not studying** as true learning—\nhence, *\"to repeat the errors of the masses.\"*\n\n**To assist the natural unfolding of all things**\nwithout presuming to act.\nHuman beings are born in stillness—\nthis is the nature of Heaven.\n\nThe Sage teaches **not to desire and not to study**\nto aid the natural unfolding of all things,\nso that each may fulfill its nature\nwithout daring to contrive artificial deviations,\nlest they lose their fundamental essence.\n\n**To uphold without failure**\nis to examine the subtle, unmanifest signs of joy and disorder,\nwithout losing the **principles of lineage and the natural support of things**—\nthis was the **ancient Way of excellence**.\n\nThus, we follow the **ancient Way of excellence as Dao**.\n\nThose who **excelled in the ancient Way of governing**\ndid not seek to enlighten the people,\nbut rather to **delude them**.\n\nThe ancient rulers who **excelled in the Way of governing themselves and transforming the people**\ncultivated **sincerity within their own hearts**,\nso that the Dao **permeated all things** while their governance remained unobtrusive,\nand the people fulfilled their capacities without artificial praise.\n\nThey did not **flaunt their teachings and decrees**,\nlest the people’s **joy and sorrow be manipulated** and deceitful scheming arise.\nInstead, they sought to **guide the people back to simplicity and naturalness**.\n\nThis is the teaching of the **ancient Way of the Sage**,\noffered as an exhortation for the present.\n\nThe difficulty in governing the people lies in their **excess of cleverness**.\nWhen the people are too clever,\ndeceit arises first.\nThough laws and decrees exist,\nthere is nothing to fear—\nhence, they are **difficult to govern**.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"If the ruler excessively favors cleverness without the Way,*\nthe world will fall into great disorder.\nHow do we know this is so?\nWhen the cleverness of **bows, crossbows, and snares** abounds,\nthe birds above are thrown into chaos.\nWhen the cleverness of **hooks, bait, nets, and traps** abounds,\nthe fish below are thrown into chaos.\nWhen the cleverness of **snares, pitfalls, and nooses** abounds,\nthe beasts in the marshes are thrown into chaos.\nWhen the cleverness of **deceit, poison, and sophistry**—\nsuch as **‘firm and white,’ ‘separating filth from purity,’ ‘same and different’**—abounds,\nthe people are bewildered by confusion.\nThus, whenever the world falls into great disorder,\nthe fault lies in the love of cleverness.\"*\n\nTherefore, **to govern a nation with cleverness is to ruin it**;\n**to employ deceitful ministers to govern a nation**\nis to **use cunning and schemes to undermine governance**,\nand to **disturb and confuse the people**—\nthis is the **ruin of the nation**.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"When wisdom arises, great deceit follows.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"When governance is meticulous,*\nthe people become cunning.\"*\n\n**Not to govern with cleverness is the nation’s blessing.**\n**To employ virtuous and sincere ministers to govern a nation**\nis to **practice non-action and simplicity**,\nand to **bring the people peace and contentment**—\nthis is the **blessing of the nation**.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves.\nI take no action, yet the people grow wealthy.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"When governance is unobtrusive,*\nthe people are pure and sincere.\"*\n\n「Du Guangting said: The ruler is like a mirror—\nwhen the mirror is upright, its reflection is true,\nwhen the mirror is crooked, its reflection is distorted.\nIf upright, the people follow and become upright;\nif crooked, the people follow and become crooked.\nThe purity or corruption of the people is not determined by others.\n\nTo employ ministers of clever schemes,\nthe use of authority and stratagem will flourish,\nto employ virtuous and loyal scholars,\nthe customs and teachings will become pure.\n\nWhen the people are transformed in purity and harmony,\nthe nation prospers and thrives—\nthis is the blessing.\n\nUnderstanding these two principles,\nis to grasp the eternal model.\n\nThe two principles refer to\nemploying cleverness and not employing cleverness.\n\nHe who employs cleverness\nharms governance and plunders the people—\nhe is the nation’s thief,\nleading to the ruin of oneself and one’s family.\nThus, not employing cleverness\nis the eternal model to be followed.\n\nHe who does not employ cleverness,\npractices virtuous governance and benefits the people—\nhe is the nation’s blessing,\nleading to honor for one’s clan and glory for one’s kin.\nThis is also the eternal model\nto be followed by those who employ cleverness.\n\nThe ancient text reads *kǎishì* (稽式), *kǎi* (稽) meaning \"to examine.\"\nIt refers to examining ancient models.\n\nAlways knowing the eternal model,\nis called *Xuándé* (玄德, profound virtue).\n*Xuán* (玄) means deep, obscure.\n\nA ruler should know\nthat blessings can be entrusted to,\nand thieves can be removed,\nbringing the *Qínshǒu* (黔首, common folk) to wealth and longevity—\nthis is profound and obscure virtue indeed.\n\nProfound virtue is deep, distant, and contrary to things,\nonly then does it reach the *Dàshùn* (大顺, Great Harmony).\n\nThe *Xuándé* (玄德) of the Sage\nis deep beyond knowing,\ndistant beyond perception.\nYet when observing their words,\nthey seem to oppose the natural order of things,\nbut when examining their essence,\nthey align with the people’s path—\nonly then do they enter the realm of *Zìrán* (自然, spontaneity),\nand nothing goes against it;\nthis is called *Dàshùn* (大顺, Great Harmony).\n\nYan Junping said:\nThe discernment of foolishness and cleverness\nis without limit,\nbringing peace to the heavens and tranquility to the earth,\nlike the *Yīnfú* (阴福, hidden blessings) of the cosmos,\nunseen by the world—\nthus it is called *Xuándé* (玄德, profound virtue),\ndeep beyond measurement,\ndistant beyond reckoning,\ncontrary to things,\nand none can overcome it.\n\nThe *Liezǐ* (《列子》) says:\nEmperor Yao governed the world for fifteen years,\nand did not know whether the world was governed or not,\ndid not know whether the ten million myriads\nwished to revere him or not.\nHe asked his attendants,\nbut they did not know;\nhe asked the outer court,\nbut they did not know;\nhe asked the commoners,\nbut they did not know.\n\nYao then dressed plainly and wandered through the bustling streets of Kang (康).\nHe heard children singing:\n*\"Establish us, the boiling masses,\nnone but you are the utmost.\nWe do not recognize you,\nyet we follow the Sage’s Way.\"*\n\nYao rejoiced and asked:\n*\"Who taught you these words?\"*\nThe children replied:\n*\"We heard them from the nobles.\"*\nYao asked the nobles:\n*\"This is an ancient poem.\"*\n\nYao returned to his court,\nsummoned Shun (舜),\nand passed the throne to him through abdication.\nShun did not decline and accepted it.\nThis is called profound virtue,\ndeep and distant, reaching Great Harmony.\n\nThe adept in the Dao\ndoes not act against the few,\ntheir virtue and measure are profound and distant,\nlike rivers flowing toward the sea,\nthus they are likened to the sea,\nthe king of all rivers.\n\nThe sea becomes the king of all rivers\nbecause it excels in humility—\nthus it can be the king of all rivers.\n\nThe *Kāiyuán Yùshū* (开元御疏) says:\nThe sea becomes the king of all rivers\nbecause it dwells in the lowest flow.\n\nThe *Yì* (《易》) says:\n*\"The Earth’s Dao transforms fullness into humility,\nand flows with modesty—\nthe Earth’s Dao uses humility,\nand all rivers converge and flow toward it.\nThe Sage uses humility,\nand the common folk come willingly without exhaustion.\"*\n\nYan Junping said:\nThe sea’s kingship\nis not achieved by accumulating virtue,\npiling up benevolence,\nor offering favors to win their devotion—\nnor is it through exalted rites,\nbroad deference,\nor adorned wisdom to please them—\nnor is it by employing unusual tactics,\nestablishing authority,\nor wielding force and displaying might to control them.\nInstead, it is through purity and stillness,\ndwelling in humility,\nwaiting in emptiness,\nwith no action and no desire—\nthat all rivers come naturally.\n\nThe rivers do not come because they hear\nthe sea’s beauty or are transformed by its virtue—\nnor are they bound by constraints,\nguided by coercion.\nYet they pierce through gold and stone,\ndrill into cliffs,\nsoak into mountains,\nand rush toward the sea without return—\nthis is the form conforming to nature,\nthe essence aligning with things,\nand the natural course of all phenomena.\n\nFrom this, we see\nthat humility as the Dao is vast indeed.\n\nA hundred harms cannot injure it,\nclever schemes cannot seize it.\nIt is strong without battle,\nmighty without coercion.\nSilent and without action,\nit engages in mutual exchange with all things.\n\nValleys are low,\nthus they can reach their end without exhaustion;\nthe sea dwells beneath,\nthus it can reign without ceasing.\n\nTherefore, the Sage desires to be above others,\nyet speaks with humility.\nThe Sage refers to those who embody\nthe humility of the lowest flow—\nthey who wish to stand above others\nmust first humble themselves in speech,\nknowing fullness invites loss.\nThus, they speak in humility and gentleness,\ntake the names of solitude and fewness,\nand their great virtue grows daily,\ntheir vast undertakings ever firm—\nnaturally, they are revered and elevated by all.\n\nTo lead others,\none must place oneself behind them.\nTo emerge first among all things,\none must humble oneself in body,\nand be gentle in words.\nThose who retreat behind others\nare cautious in their conduct,\nfollowing the Dao,\nnot presuming to lead—\nthus they are allowed by others to take precedence.\n\nTherefore, though they dwell above,\nothers do not feel burdened;\nthough they stand before,\nothers do not feel harmed.\nThe Sage, when ascending the highest treasure,\noccupying the utmost honor,\nwearies one body while resting all people,\nsparing themselves while enriching others—\nyet the people all joyfully revere them,\nas though they were light in their governance.\nThus, the people follow willingly,\nand who could harm them?\n\nTherefore, the world delights in pushing them forward\nwithout exhaustion.\nThe ruler who follows the Dao,\neven commoners flock to them,\nas though drawn by the sun,\nor praised like clouds.\nAs lord, they are never weary—\nit is their virtue of humility and sincerity that brings this.\n\nBecause they do not contend,\nnone under heaven can contend with them.\nHumility transforms the lower,\nand the lower all become humble and retreat.\nThus, the Sage always takes emptiness as their body,\nand non-action as their heart—\nwhen heart and form are void,\nwhat can contend with them?\n\nLu Xisheng said:\nThe Dao of Heaven\nreplenishes humility while diminishing fullness,\nthe Dao of Earth\ntransforms fullness into flowing humility,\nspirits and gods\nharm fullness while blessing humility,\nand human conduct\nabhors fullness while loving humility.»\n\nThe virtue of humility,\nlowly yet self-nurturing,\nthus the rivers and seas take humility as virtue,\nand all streams flow toward them.\n\nThe Sage takes humility as virtue,\nand is thus first in the world’s esteem.\nYet the Sage does not seek to be first—\nthe world delights in pushing them forward without exhaustion.\n\nRivers and seas dwell in the lowest flow,\nthe Sage-King abides in humility,\nwhile the common practice favors strength and arrogance,\ndeeming passivity as unmanly.\nThus, they are ranked below those who say,\n*\"The world says my Way is vast—\nyet I seem unworthy.\"*\n\nThe world says my Way is vast—\nyet I seem unworthy.\n*Worthy* means *resembling*.\nLaozi said:\n*\"All under heaven speak of my Way as vast and boundless—\nshining yet not dazzling,\nabundant virtue like foolishness,\nwithout form or likeness,\nas though unworthy.\"*\n\nOnly because it is vast does it seem unworthy.\nIf it were worthy, long ago it would have diminished.\nOnly my Way, vast and boundless,\nis not trusted by the lowly,\nso it is called unworthy.\nIf it were praised,\nlong ago others would have extolled it—\nwhy wait until now?\nIf my Way were praised by others,\nhow could it truly be vast?\n\nZhuangzi said:\nLaozi told Master Chengqi:\n*\"The clever, wise, divine, and sagely—\nI have long since freed myself from them.\"*\n\nThis is how Laozi has long valued\nthe unworthy over the praiseworthy.\n\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"Wuzi’s wisdom could be matched,\nbut his foolishness could not.\"*\nThis is close to the truth.\n\nI have three treasures,\nto preserve and uphold them.\nThough my Way is vast and boundless,\nwithout form or likeness,\nthere are three practices\nto rely upon and hold fast—\ntruly the supreme treasures for self-cultivation and governance.\n*(Referring to what follows.)*\n\nThe ancient text reads:\n*\"Hold them fast and treasure them.\"*\nIf the world follows these three practices as precious,\nclinging to them without abandon,\nwhat cannot they achieve?\n\nThe *He Shang Gong* version reads:\n*\"Hold them fast and preserve them.\"*\n\nFirst: *compassion*,\nsecond: *frugality*,\nthird: *not daring to lead the world.*\n\nThe *Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary* says:\nTo embody *ren* and act sincerely,\nto love and nurture the people—this is *compassion*.\nTo use sparingly and enrich others,\nwithout depletion—this is *frugality*.\nNot to initiate actions,\nto harmonize without leading—\nthis is *not daring to lead the world.*\n\nBecause of *compassion*, one is courageous.\nBecause of *frugality*, one is expansive.\nBecause one does not dare lead the world,\none can perfect tools and extend influence.\n\nThe Sage practices *compassion* as conduct,\ncourageous in aiding others—\nthe virtuous must be fearless.\nThe frugal in use\nmust be expansive in relief—\nthis is *\"moderate use and love for people.\"*\nNot daring to lead the world,\none can perfect tools and extend influence.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Seeing the dragon without head is auspicious.\"*\nThis is what is meant by\n*\"the Great Way seems unworthy.\"*\n\nLi Yue said:\nFrom the lowly, one ascends to the high—\nthus one attains lordship over the world.\n\nNow, abandoning *compassion* for *courage*,\nabandoning *frugality* for *expansiveness*,\n\nAbandoning the rear for the front—this is death.\n\nYet the world today does otherwise. Those deemed \"worthy\" are in fact contrary to the Way.\n\nAll abandon *compassion* and *virtue*, seeking instead *courage* and *righteousness*, reckless with *qi* and light in death, to ensnare others—this is the extreme peril of overreaching.\n\nUnable to love and practice frugality, they instead indulge in extravagance, greedily seeking broad expenditure, plundering until resources are exhausted. They must inevitably harm finances and the people, thus inviting the calamity of scarcity.\n\nThen, they adorn themselves with cleverness to astonish the ignorant, refine their conduct to expose filth, delight in leading others, and shame being last. Advancing without humility, retreating without restraint, their actions are bold yet unchecked—this is rebellion against the sovereign.\n\nThese three ways are not the enduring arts of the Great Way; they lead only to the ruin of family and self. Hence, it is said: *this is death.*\n\nNow, *compassion*—when wielded in war, it brings victory; when held in defense, it secures strength.\n\nAmong the Three Treasures, *compassion* is most precious, hence its partial concealment as a flaw.\n\nWhen a sovereign employs *compassion*, nurturing soldiers as one’s own, they become invincible beneath heaven.\n\nFor *compassionate* armies entering enemy lands do not trample crops, dig up graves, ravage stores, or burn dwellings. Instead, people welcome them as孝子 (filial sons) behold their benevolent parents. Those who surrender come like arrows loosed into deep valleys.\n\nThus, why must battles be fought in open fields before victory is won, or defenses fortified with gates and drums? Heaven itself will aid them, shielding with *compassion*.\n\nFor Heaven’s *Dao* rewards the virtuous and punishes the licentious. The virtuous are naturally blessed by Heaven, facing no adversity.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"Heaven’s *Dao* favors none—it aids only the virtuous.\"*\n\nThus Heaven aids them because their sovereigns and generals employ *compassion* and *virtue* to protect soldiers and people.\n\nThe Great Way seems unworthy, yet *compassion* and frugality appear unmartial—hence the next step: *the virtuous warrior is unmartial.*\n\nThe *virtuous warrior*—one who embodies *compassion* and *virtue*, punishes tyranny, relieves suffering, yet does not oppress the weak with brute force.\n\nThe skilled warrior does not rage in battle.\nFor those who master the battlefield, though armed, use force only when unavoidable. In confronting the enemy, they do not delight in slaughter. They treat war with the solemnity of mourning rites—how could they revel in anger and war?\n\nThe skilled victor does not contend.\nFor the skilled victor, triumph lies in *virtue*, not conflict. Armies conquer through harmony; harmony brings victory. They do not act from self-interest but follow the *Dao* to seize opportunity.\n\nLike Zhu Zhonglian’s whistling or Xiong Yiliang’s ball-playing—these are the ways of the skilled victor.\n\nThe skilled ruler serves beneath others.\nThe skilled ruler employs humility, not force; delights in guiding the people, who forget their labor. Thus, using ministers as advisors, they are like limbs to the body; employing generals, they are obeyed with reverence, their chariots led by the sovereign’s hand. They lead with *virtue* before demanding strength.\n\nThis is the *virtue* of non-contention, the *virtue* of harnessing others’ strength, the *virtue* of aligning with Heaven—ancient perfection.\n\nThose who excel as warriors, in battle, in victory, and in ruling—ever gentle, non-contending, humble in self-cultivation—exhaust the world’s potential and fully employ all. Is this not the *virtue* of non-contention, the strength of others?\n\nIf they lead with harmony, we respond in kind—like Heaven’s boundless grace arising from no favor, or the seasons moving without command. Thus they align with Heaven, governing in its place—this is the ultimate of ancient *Dao*.\n\nThe *virtue* of non-contention is the law of warfare, hence the next step: *the principles of warfare.*\n\n**Principles of Warfare:**\nLaozi lamented that the world’s armies take delight in war, so ancient military strategies are cited to warn against this.\n\nI dare not be the aggressor, only the defender;\nI dare not advance an inch, only retreat a foot.\n\nWarfare’s aggressor is the attacker; the defender responds. The Sage’s army acts only when forced, thus always responding—always the defender.\n\nAdvancing little, retreating much—this is the art of deep strategy against superior foes.\n\nThough enemies come, I rely on *Dao* rather than formation, thus avoiding conflict.\n\nAgain, the laws of deploying troops: the aggressor schemes through mobilization; the defender focuses on response. Though advances are few, they edge toward annihilation; though retreats are many, they turn toward survival. Thus, one must not dare to be the aggressor but the defender, not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot—just as courage in daring leads to slaughter, while courage in restraint brings life.\n\nThis is called:\n*\"Marching without marching,\nRepelling without arms,\nConfronting without enemies,\nWielding without weapons.\"*\n\nFor the purpose of warfare is to halt the enemy, valuing non-contention. Though halting them, one harbors no intent to kill.\n\nSince there is no killing intent, my army merely upholds *righteousness* in defense—thus *\"marching without marching.\"*\n\nAgain, if generals must raise arms to charge first, it is as if they have no arms to raise—such is their aversion to killing and reverence for *compassion.*\n\nEven if a tyrannical aggressor stirs rebellion, I respond with *cultural virtue* and display *righteous* armies. They will retreat upon hearing *righteousness*, naturally leaving no enemy. Though the threat of retaliation remains, there is no enemy to retaliate against—hence *\"confronting without enemies.\"*\n\nWith the enemy withdrawn, arms are sheathed. Though the ritual of bearing weapons remains, there are no weapons to wield—hence *\"wielding without weapons.\"*\n\nNo greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy—underestimating the enemy risks losing one’s *Treasure.*\n\n*Treasure* refers to life and position.\n\nUnderestimating the enemy means delighting in external warfare while neglecting internal defenses. Delighting in external warfare may yield victory or defeat, but neglecting internal defenses ensures ruin.\n\nThough the Sage rules supreme beneath heaven, considering the times of order and chaos, enemies are many.\n\nWhat then is meant by this?\n\nThe *Classic of Documents* states:\n*\"Caress me, and I will follow; oppress me, and I will become your enemy.\"*\n\nIf this is so, then even a single state or kingdom is my enemy, and even a single village or household is my enemy.\n\nThus, the sovereign who does not neglect even the lowliest minister will win the affection of all under heaven.\nThe noble who does not humiliate the widowed and orphaned will win the people’s affection.\nThe virtuous scholar who does not neglect self-cultivation will bring divine delight and heavenly harmony.\n\nOnly then can one safeguard what is most precious.\n\nWhat does it mean to say *\"near to losing my Treasure\"*?\n\nI am naturally merciful and do not delight in killing. If forced to confront an enemy, it is not my true intent. Since it is not my true intent, it is already a loss. Though the loss is not yet great, it is *\"near to losing.\"*\n\nThus, when armies clash, the first to strike is victorious.\n*\"Ant\"* (抗) means *\"to raise.\"* When two states raise their armies against each other, the side that acts first prevails.\n\n*\"Pity\"* (哀) is the expression of sincere mercy from the heart, arising from the ruler’s virtue. If the ruler retains a merciful heart, does not neglect the rites of governance, and the ministers below fulfill their loyalty, exhausting their duty to serve—then where can they fail to triumph?\n\nWarfare warns against underestimating the enemy, but its words are easily understood. Therefore, I follow with my own teachings, which are even easier to understand and even easier to practice.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Act without action.\"*\n*\"Know the world without leaving your door; know the Way without looking through a window.\"*\n*\"Practice the teaching of the unsaid.\"*\n\nAll these are the Way of *Wuwei*—simple and effortless within its proper scope. Though the words are not elaborate and the practice requires no labor, they are easy to know and easy to do.\n\nYet none under heaven can know them, none can practice them.\n\nThose who cannot know them are the lesser scholars. The lesser scholars delight in petty disputes, cling to superficial arguments, and are easily confused by *having-for-nothing* (有为). They favor attacking heterodox views, unable to purge their minds, still their thoughts, or guard the One. They remain in darkness, unaware of the Way of *Wu*—vague and unable to act.\n\nThere is a principle in speech, a master in affairs. This explains why the easy-to-know and easy-to-do is so seldom attained.\n\n*\"Principle\"* (宗) is the root, the sovereign. Though the hundred schools speak in different ways, they all converge on *li* (理, principle). Those who grasp *li* forget the words, so the ultimate principle of speech is *not-speaking*.\n\nAll affairs, though diverse in their paths, ultimately unite in *achievement*. When achievement is complete, the affairs are abandoned—thus, the master of affairs is *non-action*.\n\nThis is teaching through *non-speech* and *non-action*—how could it not be easy to know and easy to do?\n\nYan Junping said:\nThe Sage’s words root in *naturalness*, ancestral in *divine clarity*. They dwell in the inversion between speech and silence, subtle and wondrous, returning to *naturalness*. Their clarity is as if unseen, their hearing as if unheard—open yet seemingly blocked, penetrating yet seemingly exhausted. Their practice begins in *naturalness*, flows into the divine, and dwells in harmony between *action* and *inaction*. Pure, still, yielding, and weak, their movements are delicate and refined, simple and retiring, returning to *Wuwei*.\n\nOnly because they are without knowledge are they unknown to others.\n\nThe lesser scholars, blind in their ignorance, delight in parsing words and lost in debates over *solid-white* and *same-different*. Hearing the Dao of *non-speech* and *non-action*, they scoff and laugh in disbelief, deeming my Way great yet calling it unworthy.\n\nYan Junping said:\nIt is not that my Way is small or unworthy of knowledge, nor that my affairs are trivial or unworthy of action. Nor is it that the world delights in ruin, hates completion, loves calamity, and shuns rest—refusing to follow me.\n\nHuman nature opposes mine, desires conflict with mine. The wise are ensnared by desires, drowning in what they hear their whole lives, their *qi* and spirit unsettled, their hearts and intentions misaligned.\n\nFew know me, thus I am honored.\n\nThe words of the ultimate Dao have a principle and a master—only the enlightened know them, hence their rarity and sparseness.\n\nThose who attain this Dao are honored by all things, hence it is said, *\"those who follow me are honored.\"*\n\nThe *Kaiyuan* edition reads: *\"those who follow my Way are honored.\"*\n\nYan Junping said:\nThus, their clarity is not seen, their hearing not heard. Deep words return to receive slander, great deeds retreat to earn blame. The lone-seer’s clarity is useless in the world, the lone-hearer’s wisdom brings shame among the people. Those who align with divine clarity do not conform to convention, those whose achievements match the heavens and earth do not please the masses.\n\nThus, the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\n*\"Coarse cloth\"* (褐) is the garment of the lowly. Jade is pure and moist, likened to the virtue of the gentleman.\n\nThe Sage internally treasures virtue and power—this is likened to harboring jade. Externally, he lacks ornamentation—this is likened to wearing coarse cloth.\n\nThus, though his inner brilliance is vast, his outer appearance seems foolish and dim. Pearls are hidden in oysters, jade nestled in stone—none under heaven can know it, hence my Way is honored.\n\nSince common folk presumptuously claim to know the Sage’s hidden knowledge, I follow with *\"knowing the unknown.\"*\n\n*\"Knowing the unknown\"* is virtue’s height.\n*\"Not knowing the known\"* is a flaw.\n\nThe Sage, pure in *qi* and refined in nature, internally harbors true knowledge. All things are spontaneously understood, yet though capable of knowing, he does not boast in it—this is the highest virtue.\n\nThe middle and lesser scholars, coarse in *qi* and stubborn in nature, internally brimming with cunning, yet in their affairs they are arrogant and ignorant. Though they do not truly know, they forcefully argue, embellishing their words to feign knowledge—this is the flaw of virtue.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The unknown is profound; the known is shallow. The unknown is within; the known is without. This is what is called: ‘The knower does not speak; the speaker does not know.’\"*\n\nOnly because of the sickness of sickness is there no sickness.\n\nThe Sage’s true knowledge and wondrous root penetrate the dim and obscure, thus he possesses the six penetrations and four openings, transcending above and below without fixed form. Tranquil and without burden, he yet constantly suffers.\n\nThe common folk mistakenly cling to the sickness of forced knowledge, often leading them into fatal traps from which they do not return—truly a matter for lamentation.\n\nThis reveals the Sage’s compassionate heart, alone able to cure afflictions.\n\nThe common folk suffer from this sickness of forced knowledge, yet how could they harm the Sage’s virtue? Thus, true knowledge is without affliction, while forced knowledge brings sickness.\n\nThe Sage is not afflicted because he cures affliction—this is why he is not afflicted.\n\nThe Sage alone knows the virtue of ignorance and the mechanism of the Dao, dimming his sharpness and abandoning his cleverness, truly free from worldly afflictions.\n\nCompassionate and benevolent, he can cure the afflictions of all beings because he himself is without affliction.\n\nIf he had afflictions, how could he cure the afflictions of all beings?\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"No one can be weighed down by flowing water, yet people are weighed down by stagnant water. Only the still can still all things; receiving its mandate from the Earth, only the pine stands alone. Rectifying the winter and summer, its verdant hues endure; receiving its mandate from Heaven, only Shun stands alone. Rectifying his own life to rectify all lives, this is first rectifying oneself before rectifying others—just as the Sage does not suffer because he cures affliction.\"*\n\nForced knowledge loses the Dao, provoking calamity. When calamity comes yet the people do not fear, then the greatest fear arrives.\n\nIf the people do not fear the fear of Heaven or the fear of the state, then the greatest fear arrives.\n\nThe greatest fear is the omen of death.\n\nThe virtuous fear Heaven’s mandate, fear great men, and fear the words of the Sage.\n\nFor man, to establish oneself, fear must be the foundation. If one does not fear even small evils, they accumulate until the greatest fear arrives—inevitable and inescapable.\n\nYan Junping said:\n*\"When the greatest fear has arrived, one begins to do good. At this time, virtue and power cannot save, Heaven and Earth cannot resolve—this is not Heaven’s fault.\"*\n\nThose who are high and secure, bearing the fear yet wielding power, forget care and lose fear, seeking nothing from themselves.\n\nThus, those who care for their own bodies do not fear others, those who fear themselves are not controlled by others, those who are cautious in small matters do not dread great ones, and those who restrain themselves near do not regret their distance.\n\nDo not defile where you dwell.\n*Ancient reading*: \"狎\" (*xiá*), meaning \"habitual.\"\n*Where you dwell*: refers to one’s conduct.\nThe cautious and fearful must choose good neighbors, avoid corrupt companions, maintain purity in self-guarding, and hold themselves in humility—then calamity cannot touch them. Their bodies remain whole, their spirits sovereign; this is the depth of fear and caution.\n\nDo not narrow where you dwell.\n*Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary*: \"狭\" (*xiá*), meaning to broaden one’s dwelling, not to forcefully confine oneself. It lies in harmonizing light and accommodating all, not clashing with things.\n\n*Ancient reading*: \"The dwelling of the spirit is the heart.\"\nMan should forget emotions and abandon desires, softening his breast to let the spirit’s chambers rest, so that the spirit may dwell in the heart—then life is preserved.\n\nDo not corrupt where you are born.\n*Ancient reading*: \"驮\" (*tuó*), meaning \"evil.\"\nThe form given by the Dao is what is meant by \"where you are born.\"\nMan should not corrupt the evil of his Dao; he should serve diligently, revere the great, fear the Dao and fear Heaven—then he can eternally preserve his primordial blessing.\n\nIf he indulges his desires, corrupts his Dao, and despises virtue, calamity will follow swiftly.\n\n*Ancient reading*: \"The spirit born from the body.\"\nMan lives through the spirit; \"where you are born\" refers to the spirit.\nThe spirit, clear and luminous, prefers emptiness and stillness. If man washes his heart and calms his thoughts, the spirit returns of itself.\nIf he indulges in desires and debases his spirit, scheming to indulge his nature, then the spirit’s *qi* scatters and dissipates, and life is lost.\n\nThus, he is exhorted to not corrupt the spirit he was born with, to preserve the enduring Dao.\n\nOnly because one does not resist, is one not silent.\n\nOnly those who fear the Dao and fear Heaven are singularly precise and unified. In haste or leisure, they adhere to this principle—how could they have a heart for evil or laziness? Thus, the Dao’s hidden blessings descend upon them, granting a hundred auspicious signs. This is why they mutually cherish and protect, never exposing evil.\n\n*Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary*: \"Singularly precise and unified\" are words from *The Book of Documents—Great Yu’s Model* (《尚书·大禹谟》), where Shun commands Yu to take his place.\n\nMan’s heart is fraught with peril, the Dao’s heart is subtle—peril makes it hard to rest, subtlety makes it hard to discern. Only through singular precision and unity can one steadfastly grasp its center.\n\nThus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself.\nThe Sage first preserves within himself, then within others. Examining his own heart’s origin, he knows his own virtues and vices.\nThrough cleansing and purging, he ensures no dust or filth enters his gates—this is called self-knowledge.\nHaving understood the Dao’s profound silence, he acts with movement day and night, not boasting of his talents or abilities, nor being confused by things, fearing to deviate from principle or act improperly—like those who do not fear the greatest fear.\n\nHe loves himself but does not exalt himself.\nThe Sage cherishes his own body, knowing it is the Dao’s creation. He does not indulge his appetites, nor does he wallow in evil and idleness, harming the utmost principle or diminishing his form and spirit—this is called self-love.\nIf one instead covets rich flavors and fine clothes, indulges in beauty and music, finds comfort in his nature, and delights his ears and eyes, exalting himself while despising others—this is defiling where he dwells and failing to maintain purity and stillness. How could this be one who fears and is cautious in the minutest matters?\n\nThus, he abandons that and takes this.\nIf one abandons the arrogant self-exaltation and takes the fear of the greatest fear—obtaining the principle of revering the Dao and serving Heaven without growing weary of others—then external punishments fade, and life’s Dao is internally sufficient.\n\nHe does not do evil for the sake of doing evil, nor seek courage for the sake of killing—\n*Daoist True Classic: Treasury of Virtue and Power, Chapter Nine, \"Perfection of the Dao\"*\n*Daoist True Classic: Treasury of Virtue and Power, Chapter Ten, \"Refinement of the Dao\"*\n\n**Daoist True Classic: Treasury of Virtue and Power, Chapter Eleven, \"Discernment of Courage and Boldness\"**\n\nBoldness in daring leads to killing;\nCourage in restraint leads to life.\nFirm resolve is courage,\nSwift decisiveness is boldness.\nThe resolute and unyielding—\nFearless of threats, unflinching in action,\nRelying on their ruthless obstinacy,\nThey strike and slaughter without hesitation—\nThus, boldness in daring leads to killing.\n\nYet the virtuous Daoist,\nDiscerning retreat and advance,\nModerate and yielding,\nSoft and harmonious,\nDare not act recklessly,\nSpare life and avoid harm—\nThus, courage in restraint leads to life.\n\nTo know these two paths—\nOne brings benefit, the other harm—\nWhat Heaven abhors, who truly understands?\nHence, even the Sage finds this difficult.\n\nThese two refer to daring and restraint,\nTo killing and to life.\n\nThe greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is *generation*.\nThe Sage takes compassion as substance,\nYet does not delight in killing.\n\nDeath is the bitterest poison to humanity;\nAll living beings abhor it.\nBoldness in decisive action is the path of killing.\nCourage in mercy and benevolence is the path of life.\n\nIf one clings rigidly to this principle without change,\nThey have yet to grasp Heaven and Earth’s authority over life and death.\nIf today’s actions bring benefit or harm,\nIt is because the choice between killing and life remains undetermined.\n\nWhen one commits evil in plain sight,\nHumans may punish them.\nWhen one commits evil in secret,\nGhosts may slay them.\nEven the Sage’s mercy,\nHeaven’s benevolence—\nCannot pity or save them.\nYet if pardoned and spared,\nRetribution’s calamity will surely follow.\n\nThere are those who *should* be killed and are killed,\nThose who *should* live and are spared,\nThose who *should* be killed but must not be,\nThose who *should* live but must not be,\nThose whose sparing brings misfortune,\nThose whose killing brings blessing—\nHow so?\n\nYet what Heaven abhors,\nWho truly knows its reason?\nUnless one embodies the True Transformation,\nHow could one know the origins of calamity and blessing,\nThe roots of benefit and harm?\nEven the Sage’s wisdom finds boldness and daring difficult—\nHow much more so for those who dare to act by private will?\n\nThus, it remains difficult.\n\n**Yan Junping** said:\nThese two functions—\nCourage and boldness, equally matched—\nYet their strategies diverge;\nOne strikes the body, the other defies it;\nThey oppose Heaven’s intent, contradict Earth’s will;\nThey unleash their passions, indulge their desires—\nOne may turn a thousand chariots into captives,\nAnother may rise from a commoner to king.\nThus, some are born to bring fortune,\nOthers to bring ruin;\nSome are killed to bring blessing,\nOthers to bring disaster.\nThese two paths are profound—\nNone can fully fathom them.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven\nConquers without striving,\nNaturally balanced, it does not resist the myriad things,\nYet the myriad things thrive on their own.\nHow could it compete with humans over daring or restraint,\nOver killing or life?\n\nYet those who submit to it\nDo not contend with things,\nYet conquer them well—\nThis is the courage and boldness of the uninjured field.\n\nSilent yet responsive,\nHeaven speaks not—\nYet the seasons march, the myriad things flourish,\nAnd the rewards for virtue, the punishments for licentiousness,\nAre never mistaken.\nUnsummoned, they come.\nHeaven’s Dao is vast and distant,\nWith no spoken teachings—\nIt never calls the myriad things,\nYet all face the sun and shun the shade,\nSpring brings birth, autumn brings harvest—\nThis is the natural order of yin and yang’s life and death.\nMysterious yet wise in counsel.\nThe *Kaiyuan* and *He Shang Gong* versions read *\"tanran\"* (谭然).\nYan Junping’s version reads *\"mò\"* (默).\nWang Bi’s version reads *\"tǎn\"* (坦).\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is tranquil and silent, without favor or bias,\nIts justice is absolute and unerring.\nTo those who act with virtue, it returns blessings of fortune,\nTo those who act with wickedness, it returns calamities of misfortune.\nIn its power over human affairs—life and death’s decree,\nThe patterns of *xiàngwěi* and celestial movements—\nIt never falters, never fails.\nIs this not the wisdom of the Great Planner?\n\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and wide,\nThough sparse, it never lets slip.\nStretched across the boundless void, it is called the Heavenly Net.\nIts breadth and expanse are called *huánghuáng*—this is *liàn*.\nIts reach into darkness and light, with no escape, is called *bù shī*.\nThus, the bold are slain,\nYet the common folk do not fear death—\nHence, the saying: *\"the common folk do not fear death.\"*\n\nFor there are two meanings to \"not fearing death\":\nThe enlightened know its natural order and do not fear it.\nThe foolish lose sight of its natural order and yet do not fear it.\n\nBy Heaven’s nature, humans are born in stillness,\nYet delight in life and dread death—this is human nature.\nThey till the fields and eat,\nThey weave and wear,\nThey rest in their dwellings,\nThey take joy in their labors,\nThey nurture the living and bury the dead—\nThese are the customs of the world.\n\nWhen the people abide by their natural ways,\nAnd officials uphold their proper laws,\nWithout wrong or excess,\nThey meet their natural deaths.\nIf the people’s lives and deaths follow their natural course,\nThen why should they fear it?\n\nBut when virtue declines,\nAnd rulers cannot refrain from action,\nTheir nets and laws become dense and strict,\nThe people barely survive.\nTheft and deceit arise,\nThey cheat the hungry and sow chaos.\nThe small fear trembles within them,\nThe great fear paralyzes them,\nAnd they forget death.\nHow can severe punishments and cruel officials\nInstill terror in the common folk?\nThe ancient text reads: *\"How can one make the people fear death?\"*\n\nIf the people were to fear death,\nAnd yet still commit crimes,\nI would seize and execute them—\nWho would dare?\n\nFor fear of death also has two meanings:\nThose who cherish life and act with caution\nFear Heaven’s judgment and seek virtue.\nThose who commit evil and crave ease\nFear punishment and feign obedience to the law.\n\nMoreover, by nature, humans\nAbandon their burdens and walk freely,\nOr lie at ease, drumming their bellies in leisure.\nLost in confusion, they know not of aging’s approach—\nThese are the people who follow the natural order.\n\nNow, with laws and decrees multiplying,\nEvery movement risks death,\nThus the people are made to fear death.\nWhen the people fear death,\nThey cling to life’s fleeting comforts,\nAnd nurture treacherous, deceitful schemes\nTo evade the laws.\nWhen deceit flourishes and calamities arise,\nThe officials seize and slaughter,\nSevering the roots of evil—\nWho would dare transgress?\n\nThe natural order executes those who execute.\nHe Shang Gong says:\n*\"Those who execute\"* refer to Heaven’s high and distant gaze,\nJudging the sins of those below.\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and wide—\nIt speaks of Heaven’s clear discernment, nothing unseen.\nWhy need there be harsh punishments and strict laws?\n\nDu Guangting says:\n*\"Those who execute\"* are the sovereign’s agents,\nGreat in nurturing life and loving the people.\nIn the *Nan Gong Dan Lu* scrolls, rewards are given for virtue,\nAnd in the *Bei Guan Hei Lu* records, crimes are punished.\nHeaven and Earth, with all their gods,\nOversee the deeds of good and evil,\nTo chastise and encourage,\nSo that evil may be abandoned and virtue cultivated.\nThus, those with merit are granted longevity,\nThose with guilt have their years cut short,\nNo fraction lost—\nLike the *Yángguān* officials in their meticulous reckoning.\nHeaven has the *Sì Sī* stars that govern fate,\nPositioned between *Xū* and *Wēi*,\nOverseeing merit, demerit, lifespan—\nThis is Heaven’s execution of judgment.\nIt examines crimes and blessings obliquely,\nSo that all may know to cultivate virtue and avoid evil.\n\nThe ruler teaches with virtue,\nAnd moves with compassion and forgiveness.\nAs for those who do not act virtuously,\nHeaven’s executioners will slay them themselves.\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and forgiving,\nThough sparse, it does not let slip.\nTo defy Heaven and reverse the Dao—\nWhere can one flee punishment?\n\nTo execute in Heaven’s place\nIs like a clumsy carpenter taking the master’s tools.\nTo execute in Heaven’s place,\nTo wield judgment and rely solely on punishments,\nTo usurp the authority of *Zàohuà* over life and death—\nThis is like a clumsy man replacing a skilled artisan.\n\nTo take the master’s tools,\nFew are those who do not harm their hands.\nTo replace a master artisan with a clumsy one,\nNot only will the wood be ruined and the work spoiled,\nBut also hands will be injured and fingers broken.\nThis illustrates how rulers,\nBy usurping *Zàohuà*’s authority over life and death,\nAnd recklessly applying their laws and punishments,\nNot only harm the common folk,\nBut also sever the harmonious *héqì*.\n\nFor Heaven’s Dao is high and bright,\nWhile human understanding is narrow and dim.\nTo have a ruler with limited wisdom\nUsurp the place of Heaven’s boundless clarity,\nAnd mislead the people in their natural order—\nThis is to lose the governance of nature.\n\nThe people do not fear death,\nBut only hunger.\nHence, the next phrase: *\"the people’s hunger.\"*\nThe people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxes—\nThus they starve.\n\nThe people are the foundation of the state.\nWhen governance is burdensome, taxes grow heavy,\nAnd the people’s poverty weakens the state’s roots.\nTherefore, the ruler depends on the people for sustenance,\nAnd the people rely on the ruler for stability.\nIf taxes are taken in excess, both ruler and people starve.\nIf the people are stripped bare while the ruler grows rich,\nBoth suffer ruin.\n\nDu Guangting says:\n*\"The laws and decrees are clearly established in antiquity.\n‘Food’ refers to the ruler’s provisions,\n‘Taxes’ to the state’s revenues.\"*\n\n「Hence, the tax of one-tenth (*shíyī zhī shuì*) must be light in its implementation. Heavy taxes impoverish the people, while light taxes ensure their sufficiency. When the people are well-provided, the state flourishes; when they are impoverished, the state is in peril. The principle lies in moderation—laws should not be too harsh. Thus, when rulers cast penal codes with severity, they provoke resentment; when they impose burdensome levies, the land grows poor. The Marquis of Qi (*Qī Hóu*) perished through excessive demands, while the Duke of Tian (*Tián Shì*) became a hegemon through generous grants. Let the enlightened ruler take heed of these lessons.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because their rulers act excessively—thus they are difficult to govern. Excessive action leads to burdensome governance; non-action brings simplicity. Simplicity is easy to follow, while complexity is hard to govern. When the ruler indulges in fine jade and lavish meals, the common folk delight in coarse grains and husks. Strict nets of law and harsh decrees make governance difficult. The people grow indifferent to death because their pursuit of life is so desperate—thus they become reckless with death. When governance is oppressive, taxes and levies are heavy, and the people lose their means of livelihood, they then transgress laws and break prohibitions, readily facing death. This is because their desperate search for sustenance leads them to disregard danger, even to wade through water and fire without fear or to confront blades without hesitation—hence, they are said to treat death lightly.\n\nOnly those who do not cling to life are truly wiser than those who do. Those who greedily chase life and profit are like sheep running to the slaughter, hastening their own demise. Yet there are those who outwardly forget life’s concerns: they endure hardship without humiliation, eat humble fare yet find it sweet, and though the world’s affairs may be tumultuous, they remain tranquil and at ease. This is how they differ from those who cling to life.\n\nClinging to life is both a blessing and a curse—it nourishes life, yet also becomes a self-inflicted burden. Those who value life excessively are driven by bodily comfort, craving for rich flavors, fine garments, and pleasing colors; they seek harmonious sounds, and if denied, they grow anxious and fearful, even to the point of blaming others and recklessly inviting death. When the people are hungry, their spirits scatter and they grow indifferent to death; when they are well-fed, their bodies and minds are whole and they cherish life—thus the next phrase: *\"the people’s life is soft and frail.\"*\n\nThe people’s life is soft and frail, yet their death is firm and resolute. When alive, the people absorb the *yuánhé* Dao’s *qi* and embrace the *zhēnyī* essence’s vitality, their bodies and spirits whole—thus their limbs are soft and frail. But when they die, the *yuánhé* *qi* disperses, the *zhēnyī* essence is exhausted, their forms decay and their spirits vanish—thus their limbs become firm and rigid.\n\nAll things, grasses and woods alike, are soft and pliable when alive, yet dry and brittle when dead. When alive, they are nourished by the *qi* of heaven and earth flowing within, and by the *yīnyáng* fluids moistening without—thus their spring shoots are tender and can be bound, their summer leaves flourish and can be woven, a display of their softness. When they die, the *qi* of heaven and earth dissipates within, and the *yīnyáng* fluids wither without—thus their autumn fruits turn crimson and fall, their winter branches wither and can be snapped, a sign of their brittleness.\n\nThe ancient sage understood this principle well—this is the act of the ruthless. The ruthless see life and death as mere gathering and scattering of *qi*. The enlightened understand life and death as the preservation or loss of Dao. Thus, the firm and resolute are the followers of death, while the soft and frail are the followers of life.\n\nThe *Kāiyuán* commentary states: *\"Grasses and woods are soft and pliable when alive, firm and brittle when dead. Thus, for those who act with firmness and rigidity, they are the followers of death; for those who act with softness and frailty, they are the followers of life.\"*\n\nYán Jūn Píng said: *\"Where the yang *qi* resides, even wood can be woven and grass can be bound. Where the yang *qi* departs, water can freeze and ice can shatter. Thus, the enlightened yang *qi* is the root of life, and softness and frailty are the medicine for all things. Softness and frailty are the means of gentle growth, while the enlightened yang *qi* is what sustains them. All things follow the yang *qi* in their softness and frailty, so the firm and rigid are the true likeness of death, while the soft and pliable are the true likeness of life. Hence, when armies are strong, they cannot prevail.\"*\n\nYù Zhēn said: *\"War is an instrument of violence and a tool of conflict, a realm where one encounters the enemy in battle. When armies are strong, the ruler becomes complacent while the generals grow arrogant; when generals are arrogant, the soldiers grow reckless. A complacent ruler faces arrogant generals, while arrogant generals confront reckless soldiers—defeat is inevitable before victory can even be pursued. Thus, Jié and Zhòu, despite their armies of a million each, were overthrown across the four seas; Qīn Shǐhuáng, despite his unified empire, lost all nine regions; Xiàng Yǔ rose as hegemon yet perished swiftly; Wáng Mǎng usurped the throne and was destroyed in turn. Fú Jiān met disaster at the Huái River, while Suí Yáng was shattered at the Chu Palace—these rulers all commanded armies numbering in the tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, yet none could rely on their strength to secure victory. These are clear proofs that strong armies do not prevail.\"*\n\nMoreover, conquering the enemy is not difficult; maintaining victory is the challenge. Only the ruler who follows the Dao can hold onto victory. The defeats of these past rulers all stemmed from their inability to maintain victory.\n\nWood is strong in its trunk and roots, yet its branches and leaves are soft and pliable, bearing fruit above. The *Kāiyuán* commentary states: *\"Wood is inherently strong and sturdy, so its roots and trunk remain firm and low, while its branches and leaves, soft and weak, bear fruit above. This is because the soft and pliable are positioned above, while the strong and rigid remain below.\"*\n\nThe strong and sturdy are at the base, while the soft and pliable are above. Wood’s strong trunk and roots always reside below, its soft branches and tender leaves always above. If wood behaves thus, how much more so for humans, for nations! When the vital *qi* of life persists, the people are soft and frail—this is the Dao of humility. Heaven’s Dao favors humility, hence the next phrase: *\"the Dao of Heaven.\"*\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow. The *Kāiyuán* commentary states: *\"Heaven’s Dao is vast and lofty; no analogy can clarify it better than the method of drawing a bow, which reveals Heaven’s virtue in action. The high must be lowered, the low must be raised; the excessive must be diminished, the deficient must be supplemented.\"* The *Kāiyuán* commentary further explains: *\"The bow’s purpose is to combine materials and set its form, ensuring that its slackness and tension are balanced, its high and low adjusted—this is the standard for shooting arrows.\"*\n\n「Adjusting the excessive and supplementing the deficient is for determining the distance of the shot—whether the arrow will hit its mark or fall short. Thus, it achieves its target, and the discussion returns to the Dao of Heaven. The *Yì* [《易》] states: *\"The Dao of Heaven is established in the interplay of yin and yang. Yang governs ascent, yin governs descent; when yang ascends to its utmost in Heaven, it descends; when yin descends to its utmost in Earth, it ascends. This is the symbol of restraining the high and elevating the low, as in drawing a bow.\"* The yin-yang cycles of Heaven’s Dao—seven interludes of fullness and emptiness—adjust the excess of the day and supplement the deficiency of the moon. The sun’s heat and moon’s chill, one advancing and one retreating, thus complete the year’s work.\n\nA wise ruler should follow Heaven’s Dao: restraining the strong and aiding the weak, diminishing excess and augmenting deficiency. Hence, the emphasis on *kuī* [亏, deficiency] and *yíng* [盈, fullness], on *jiàn* [谦, humility], to ensure that all measures are balanced and applied with fairness.\n\nYán Jūn Píng [严君平] remarked: *\"When craftsmen make a bow, they ensure neither over-tightness nor slackness, neither excessive compression nor tension. They shape it with compass and square, guide it with plumb line. If the string is too high and taut, they loosen and relax it; if too low and slack, they gather and raise it. Where there is excess, they trim and diminish; where there is deficiency, they reinforce and add. The string’s tension and the bow’s body harmonize, the upper and lower parts balance, equanimity as their core, accord as their norm—thus the bow can measure weight and the arrow can fly true.\"* To restrain the high and elevate the low, to diminish the great and augment the small, is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven’s Dao supplements the deficient and diminishes the excessive, but human affairs do the opposite: diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive. The *Kāiyuán* commentary [开元御疏] states: *\"This clarifies that human affairs cannot match Heaven’s Dao of augmentation and diminution, but instead favor the many at the expense of the few.\"* In the *Yì* [《易》], when one *kuī* [亏, diminishes] the lower and augments the upper, it is called *kuī* [损]. When one diminishes the upper and augments the lower, it is called *yì* [益], and the lower is taken as the foundation. Diminishing the lower while augmenting the upper—its Dao proceeds upward—thus in the *Tài* hexagram [泰卦], when one diminishes the lower and augments the upper, the transformation yields *kuī* [损]. Diminishing the upper while augmenting the lower—the people rejoice without bound—thus in the *Pǐ* hexagram [否卦], when one diminishes the upper and augments the lower, the transformation yields *yì* [益]. This is the method by which the Sage established the hexagrams and observed their symbols.\n\nWho, then, could withhold excess to serve all under Heaven? Even those who claim to follow the Dao.\n\nThis is a rhetorical question, elaborating its meaning. The question asks: *\"Who can align with Heaven’s Dao of descending to aid the people, sacrificing their own excess of rank and wealth to provide for the poor and needy of all under Heaven?\"* The answer states: *\"Only the Daoist sage, the virtuous ruler, and the wise philosopher can do so.\"* The term *\"deliver\"* [奉] emphasizes that the Sage-ruler, though elevated, never forgets the lowly—just as the humble serve the exalted without claiming superiority. Thus, the Sage acts without arrogance, achieves without clinging, and does not desire to be called virtuous.\n\nThe Sage is *yuán tōng* [圆通, omniscient and adaptable], using the Way as wisdom and adapting to circumstances as their heart. They order all things without claiming righteousness, nourish all ages without claiming benevolence, endure from ancient times without claiming longevity, and shape the myriad forms of existence without claiming cleverness. How could they boast of their own deeds, pride themselves on their virtues, or, upon completing their work, insist on retaining their position? Only by not clinging and not claiming can they lead the humble like the master of the *wéi* [韦, coarse] materials.\n\nHeaven’s Dao augments the few and diminishes the excess, restraining the high and elevating the low—only the Daoist sage can embody this principle of humility. Hence, the next point: *\"Under Heaven, nothing is as soft and weak as water.\"* Though water is the softest and weakest of all things, it can overcome the hardest and strongest—nothing can replace it. Among all things under Heaven, water is the most soft and weak, yet it pierces metal and stone, conquering the hard and strong with no rival.\n\nAgain, consider humanity: water can be blocked by dams, directed by channels, contained by dikes, and diverted by obstacles—high, low, perilous, or muddy, it flows in countless ways. Yet because of its soft and weak nature, it remains unaltered in its essence. Thus, softness overcomes hardness, and weakness overcomes strength—all under Heaven know this, yet few can practice it. Everyone knows that water extinguishes fire, yin subdues yang, the tongue is soft yet preserves, while the teeth are hard yet break—these are common truths. Yet people follow their own desires and cannot embody the Dao of softness and weakness. Hence, Lǎozi [老子] sighed deeply, and he cited the Sage’s words to illustrate the practice of softness and weakness.\n\nTherefore, the Sage said: *\"To bear the defilement of the state is to be called the Lord of the Soil and Grain.\"* The Sage’s words—whether the remnants of the *Sān Bēn* [三坟] or Lǎozi’s humble phrasing—teach that a ruler can accept the blame of the state, taking upon themselves all the faults of the people. If one person bears the guilt, the myriad cannot be burdened, then the people will look up in admiration and not scatter. Thus, they can perpetually serve the Soil and Grain as their sovereign.\n\nThe *Hóng Liè Jiě* [《鸿烈解》] recounts: *\"When Jin attacked Chu, the army did not advance despite three withdrawals. The officials urged the king to strike. King Zhuang [庄王] said: 'In my father’s time, Jin did not attack Chu. Now, in my reign, Jin attacks Chu—this is my fault. How can I bring shame upon the state?' Wèi Dàfū [韦大夫] replied: 'In my father’s time, Jin did not attack Chu. Now, in my reign, Jin attacks Chu—this is my fault. I beg the king to strike.' The king wept bitterly, his tears flowing like rain, then ascended and bowed to Wèi Dàfū. When the people of Jin heard this, they said: 'The ruler and his minister both claim the fault as their own, and the king even humbles himself before his subject—we cannot attack such a state.' That night, they retreated and returned home.\"* This is an example of *\"bearing the defilement of the state\"*—the first instance of *\"the Lord of the Soil and Grain.\"*\n\nWhen founding a state, emperors and kings place the ancestral temple on the left and the Soil and Grain altar on the right. The ancestral temple honors the ancestors and aligns with Heaven; the Soil and Grain altar honors agriculture and the harvest. The *bèi* [备] and *qì* [弃] hexagrams [卦] signify the abundance that sustains the people’s livelihood—food is the foundation of life. Since food is essential to humanity, a state must first establish its Soil and Grain altar, and the ruler must serve as its guardian.\n\nTo bear the defilement of the state is to be called the *\"King of All Under Heaven.\"* If a ruler can practice humility and softness, bearing the state’s ills without complaint, then all under Heaven will return to benevolence, and the six directions will rest in harmony—they are the *\"King of All Under Heaven.\"* The commentary states: *\"Mountains and rivers accept filth, and so too should a ruler bear defilement.\"*\n\n「The *Hóngliè Jiě* [《鸿烈解》] states: During the time of Duke Jing of Song [宋景公], the wandering star [荧惑] was in the constellation of the Heart [心], and the Duke, fearful, summoned Zi Wei [子韦] and asked: *\"What does the wandering star in the Heart portend?\"*\n\nZi Wei replied: *\"The wandering star is a Heavenly punishment [天罚]. The Heart is the Song realm’s celestial division [宋分野]. The calamity will soon fall upon the ruler. Though it may be transferred to the prime minister [宰相], such a deed would be inauspicious.\"*\n\nThe Duke said: *\"The prime minister governs the state [治国家], and transferring death to him would be unpropitious.\"*\n\nZi Wei replied: *\"It may be transferred to the people [民].\"*\n\nThe Duke said: *\"If the people die, who will serve as my subjects?\"*\n\nZi Wei replied: *\"It may be transferred to the year [岁].\"*\n\nThe Duke said: *\"The year is the people’s life [民之命]. If the year brings famine, the people will surely perish. As a ruler, to kill the people to save myself—who would still recognize me as their sovereign?\"*\n\n*\"My fate is already sealed,\"* the Duke declared, *\"do not speak further.\"*\n\nZi Wei bowed twice and said: *\"I dare congratulate you, my lord. Heaven is exalted yet hears the lowly, and you have spoken words befitting a ruler [君人之言]. Three times you have borne this punishment, and three times the wandering star will shift its course. Tonight it will move three stages [三舍], each stage seven *lǐ* [里], and thus your life will be extended by twenty-one years. I beg leave to lie in wait beneath your throne this very evening to observe it.\"*\n\nIndeed, the star shifted three stages that night.\n\nThis is the *\"bearing the state’s ills\"* [受国不祥], the *\"King of All Under Heaven\"* [天下王].\n\nWords are reversed in meaning.\n\nHe who practices **softness and weakness** [柔弱] may become a ruler [君主], but he who relies on **rigidity and strength** [刚强] will invite disaster.\n\nThe **Sage** [圣人] bears defilement and evil, yet eternally preserves the **Great Auspiciousness** [元吉].\nThe common folk delight in beauty and honor, yet ultimately meet ruin.\n\n*\"Bearing the state’s ills\"* [受国不祥] aligns with the **Way** [道], yet the people’s hearts remain unfulfilled. Thus, it follows with *\"harmonizing great grudges\"* [和大怨].\nTo harmonize great grudges is to leave lingering grudges behind.\n\nIf a ruler cannot govern with **effortless humility** [无为谦弱], the people will grow greedy and contentious, leading to reckless youths who block the roads [道卫], their arms raised in defiance. Then the ruler must establish teachings and laws to restrain them—*those who kill shall die, those who wound shall be punished*.\n\nTo respond to grudges with harmony is to turn their resentment into greater resentment. It is better to have no grudges than to have grudges and yet respond with harmony.\n\nTo know only how to harmonize great grudges, yet not understand how these grudges arise in the first place—even if one responds with utmost fairness [至公], lingering grudges will remain.\nThis is like a carpenter’s apprentice [大匠] cutting wood; few will escape harming their hands.\n\nBut if one responds with **heartless virtue** [无心至德], it is nearly as if one were creating the world anew.\nHow then can one speak of goodness?\n\nThe **Sage and Worthies** [圣贤] originally used punishment and governance to harmonize grudges and evil, yet how can one speak of goodness when deceit and treachery only grow worse, and resentment and longing increase?\n\nThus the **Sage** holds the **left token** [左契], yet does not blame the people.\n\nLü Xīshēng [陆希声] said: *\"In ancient times, people tied knots for agreements, yet none deceived; when they split wood for tokens, none violated them. This was because the Sage had no fixed intentions of his own—he took the people’s hearts as his own.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s heart and the people’s hearts were as inseparable as the **left and right tokens** [左右契].\nWhen tokens were presented, they were united in trust, and the Sage did not blame the people. Thus, ruler and subject grew close, and grudges never took root.\n\nLǐ Róng [李荣] said: *\"In ancient times, the Sage carved wooden tokens—rulers held the left, ministers the right—and united them as a pledge of trust. No further laws were needed, so the Sage did not blame the people. If he did not blame them, how could grudges arise?\"*\n\nThus, the **virtuous** [有德] held tokens to ensure **harmony** [契], while the **unvirtuous** [无德] held the **right tokens** [彻].\n**彻** [彻] means **permeation** [通], the **Way** [道].\n**司** [司] means **to govern** [主].\nThe **virtuous** refers to rulers of the **Middle Ages** [中古], who had no written laws, only carved tokens and matching symbols as pledges of trust. The people followed of their own accord, so they were called **virtuous**.\n\nThe **unvirtuous** refers to rulers of the **Far Antiquity** [远古], whose virtue was so vast it had no name. All things followed their natural course—dwelling in caves, nesting in trees, each content in its place. Their rulers had no schemes or thoughts; they appeared alone at dawn, and this was not considered neglect. Their virtue was profound and their Way mysterious—no tokens were needed for governance, only to ensure **permeation** [通彻] was upheld. Thus they were called **unvirtuous**.\n\nThis is the saying of Du Guāngtíng [杜光庭].\nThe old saying held that **彻** [彻] meant **traces** [迹], or that it meant **establishing norms** [作轨]. But if laws are enforced to guide the people, they will bring exhaustion and decay—hence the term **unvirtuous**.\n\nNow, **permeation** [通] is the more enduring interpretation.\n\nHeaven’s **Way** [道] has no favorites—it aligns with those who are good.\nHeaven’s **Way** has no bias—it bestows itself only upon the good, as the saying goes: *\"The Heavenly net is vast and wide, though its mesh seems sparse, yet nothing escapes.\"* [天网恢恢，疏而不失]\n\nThus, those who practice **great goodness** [上善] naturally find their ways in accord.\nWhy would they need tokens or laws to blame the people?\n\nThis is the **Way** of the **Far Antiquity** [太古] once more.\n\nTo harmonize grudges is to leave grudges unresolved; to **cease grudges** [息怨] is to govern with **non-action** [无为].\nTo govern with **non-action** is to dwell in **smallness** [小] yet not covet, hence it follows with *\"small state, few people\"* [小国寡民].\n\nIn a **small state with few people**, even if they possess **tenfold or hundredfold tools** [什伯之器], they will not use them.\n**什** [什] means **five** [伍], **伯** [伯] means **long** [长], and **器** [器] refers to **materials and tools** [材器].\n\nA small state can defend itself; few people can sustain themselves.\nThis is the return to the **Far Antiquity** [太古].\n\nLet the people have **units of five and ten** [部曲什伯], and command them to respect their ranks without encroaching upon one another.\nBecause the ruler governs with **non-action**, the people’s livelihoods flourish, and their materials and tools become grand and wondrous, yet unused.\nThis is the **ultimate governance** [至治].\n\nLet the people **cherish life** [重死] and **not wander far** [不远徙].\nIf a ruler governs with **non-action**, his **virtue and transformation** [德化] will be pure.\nIf the people are simple and unadorned, they will not lightly court death—**rooted in their origins** [崇本], they will **abandon superficiality** [弃末].\nThey till the fields and weave cloth, each clinging to their ancestral homes and not straying.\nEven the **Xuanhuang** [轩皇] and **Jiǔ** [几蘧] of old could not surpass this governance.\n\nThough **boats and carriages** [舟舆] exist, they are unused.\n*Wooden boats are hollowed to cross water*—this is for distant travel.\nYet this is for distant travel.\nNow, for rulers who uphold the **Way**, in large states they seek only to **shelter the people** [兼畜人], in small states they seek only to **have the people serve them** [入事人].\nThey do not encroach upon one another, nor do they engage in trade.\nThough they possess boats and **straight paths** [直], they abandon them and do not use them.\n\nZhuāngzǐ [庄子] said: *\"In the age of **Great Virtue** [至德], mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes had no boats or bridges. All things thrived in their natural state—this was the **Way** of their homeland.\"*\n\nThough **armor and weapons** [甲兵] existed, they were never employed.\nWeapons were originally set up to **punish treacherous ministers** [讨逆臣] and **ward off bandits** [御乱寇].」\n\n「When the ruler acts with **non-action** [無為], the subjects observe their duties, the people do not stray, and the four borders remain at peace—then **armor and weapons** [甲兵] are not needed.\n\nLet the people return to the use of **knotted cords** [結繩] for record-keeping.\nThe *Commentary on the Changes* [《系辞》] states: *\"In the ancient times, knotted cords were used to govern affairs; later, the sages replaced them with writing and inscriptions.\"*\nIn the age of knotted cords, all were pure and simple.\nOnce writing was introduced, deceit and falsehood grew daily.\nNow, to restore the people to their original simplicity and purity,\nthe ruler must make them return to the use of knotted cords.\n\nLet their food be simple yet satisfying,\ntheir clothing plain yet comfortable,\ntheir dwellings humble yet secure,\nand their customs joyful yet unadorned.\nWhen the ruler above has no desires, the people below naturally become simple.\nIf their tastes are not indulged, the people will know contentment.\nEven coarse vegetables and plain broth will fill their bellies with sweetness,\nwhile hemp garments and deer-hide cloaks will keep them warm without finery.\nReed huts and wattle-and-daub walls will shield them from wind and rain,\nand the torrid southern heat or the bitter northern cold will be endured with ease.\nThus, their customs remain unspoiled by artificiality,\nand their land is free from pestilence and disease.\n\nNeighboring states may be in sight,\nand the sounds of roosters and dogs may be heard across borders—\nyet the people live out their lives without ever visiting one another.\nNeighboring states in sight means the territories are contiguous.\nRoosters and dogs heard nearby means the people are plentiful and the lands close.\nThe people live until old age without ever facing enemies—\nthis is to say they are free from war and die of natural causes.\nTheir lack of interaction is like fish forgetting each other in rivers and lakes,\nor people forgetting each other in the **Dao/Way** and its arts—\nthis is the harmony of the **Huxu and Lu tribes** [赫胥尊、卢氏] of ancient times.\n\nWhen the people know contentment, their words are sincere yet unadorned,\nso next comes the principle: *\"Sincere speech is not beautiful.\"*\nSincere speech is plain and without flavor—like water.\nWater’s plainness allows it to endure;\nits lack of adornment is its natural quality.\nBeautiful speech is sweet and overindulgent—like fine wine.\nSweetness makes it fleeting;\nits lack of sincerity lies in its excess.\nThe **good** [善] do not argue,\nwhile the argumentative are not **good**.\nThe **good** value inner virtue and noble action,\nwhile those who do not argue return to their original simplicity.\nThe eloquent value persuasion,\nwhile the unvirtuous are mired in right and wrong.\nThe wise are not learned in many things,\nwhile the learned are not truly wise.\nThe wise understand the **Dao/Way**—\nthey grasp principles and roots,\nseizing only what is essential.\nWhy need they be learned in many things?\nThis is called **\"sufficiency\"** [少則得].\nThe *Sutra of the Western Ascension* [《西升经》] says:\n*\"He who attains the One fulfills all things,\nand without clinging, the spirits and gods submit.\"*\n\nThe learned are those who exhaustively study varied doctrines,\nseeking only to prove their own views.\nThe unwise are those who accumulate knowledge only to be confused by it.\nZhuāngzǐ [庄子] said: *\"When **virtue/power** [质] is lost to **learning** [文], and **learning** is pursued to excess, the mind drowns in partial truths.\"*\n\nThe sages do not hoard.\nHaving given to others, they grow ever more abundant;\nhaving bestowed upon others, they grow ever wealthier.\nHoarding means storing and accumulating.\nThe sages’ **Dao/Way** benefits all under heaven,\nyet they do not hoard **virtue/power** [德] to elevate themselves.\nThey accumulate yet also scatter,\nnor do they store wealth to enrich themselves.\nThey neither delay their works externally\nnor gather their wisdom internally—\nboth are harmonized, hence they are called **\"non-hoarding\"** [不積].\nZhuāngzǐ [庄子] said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** of Heaven flows without accumulation,\nthus all things flourish.\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **Sage Emperor** [帝道] flows without accumulation,\nthus all under heaven is united.\nThe **Dao/Way** of the sages flows without accumulation,\nthus all within the seas submit.\"*\n\nThe sages do not hoard because\nthey manifest **moral virtue** [道德] for the people.\nThe people receive their benefits, and the sages’ **virtue/power** [德] becomes ever clearer—\nlike a **weight of gold** [镒] illuminating others without concealing its own goodness or ill-will,\nyet its brilliance never diminishes.\nThis is the metaphor for inner wisdom.\n\nThey distribute wealth to the poor,\nand the poor, receiving their bounty, find their abundance ever greater—\nlike a well that endures constant drawing,\nbenefiting all without depletion,\nyet its waters remain pure and inexhaustible.\nThis is the analogy for external works.\n\nThe opening chapter of the upper section\nclarifies that the **Dao/Way** is the fundamental teaching,\nand its body aligns perfectly with its subtlety.\n\nThe closing chapter of the upper section\nexpounds that **non-action** [無為] is **non-inaction** [無不為],\nrevealing the essence of the teaching,\nand its application suits the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThus, the form and use are both forgotten,\nand the beginning and end are seamlessly connected.\n\nThe opening chapter of the lower section\nexplains that **\"having virtue/power\" [有德] and \"lacking virtue/power\" [無德]** are the responses to teaching,\nfollowing the **Way**’s purification and refinement of the times.\n\nThe closing chapter of the lower section\nuses the contrast of *\"sincere speech\"* [信言] and *\"insincere speech\"* [不信言]\nto demonstrate the teaching’s application,\nallowing things to manifest naturally as adorned or plain,\nand thus conforming to the **Dao/Way**.\n\nTherefore, by adapting to the times and allowing things to unfold naturally—\nwithout opposing or contending—\nit is to uphold their original **virtue/power** [元德]\nand to align with **Creation** [造化],\nto restore the **Dao/Way**’s constancy\nand enter its **mysterious gate** [妙门].\n\nThe *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* [《道德真经》] concludes the tenth scroll of the *Cherished Obscurity* [藏室慕微] section.»",

Ten volumes.\n\nAccording to **Yáng Zhònggēng’s preface**, this work was published in the year **Bǎobǎo 6** of the **Dàodé Zhōng** school (1258 CE). The original source is the *Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), under the *Dòngshén* (Cavernous Deities) section, in the **Jùjié** (Jade Precepts) category.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One**\nCompiled by **Bìxū Zǐ Chén Jǐngyuán**\n\n**Daoist Scripture (Upper Section)**\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is expounded in terms of **Chángdào** (the Eternal Dao). The **Chángdào** is the **void-hearted** (emptiness of the mind) that awaits all things.\n\nThe Dao, when it can be spoken of, is **not** the **Chángdào**. The Dao that can be articulated is subject to change, to transmigration, to speech and explanation—this is called **teachings and precepts**. How is it different from dross? Let us examine it by elucidating:\n\nThe Dao is **the Way of universal passage** (通). All things obtain it, and thus nothing is impassable.\nIt is also called **the Way of traversal** (蹈), taking the path as its metaphor.\nThe *Shuōwén* (Explanations of Script and Characters) states: **\"One path reaching through is called Dao.\"** The ancient sages commanded that it be embodied and practiced, hence it is called **Dao**.\n\nAs for **virtue/power** (德) such as *rén* (benevolence), *yì* (righteousness), *lǐ* (propriety), *zhì* (wisdom), and *xìn* (faithfulness), these are all **applications of the Dao**. When applied, it is called **the Dao that can be spoken of**.\n\nOnce the **Dao that can be spoken of** is made manifest, it is **no longer the Chángdào**. The **Chángdào** is the spontaneous and natural, responding to sensation and transforming without end. It cannot be transmitted by words, nor can it be sought by intellect—only by embodying and merging with the **transformative power** (造化), containing the luminous light and hiding its radiance, acting without action yet accomplishing all things, silently attaining its utmost.\n\n**Yán Jùnpíng** (严君平) said: The **Dao that can be spoken of** is the **Dao of virtue/power** made manifest, yet it is **not** the natural Dao.\n\nThose who practice today do not carry torches by day, for the sun is bright. The sun’s brightness is the **Dao that is not spoken of**, eternal in its constancy. Carrying torches is the **Dao that can be spoken of**, made manifest.\n\nWhat is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and can be passed on to others—this is the **Dao that can be spoken of**. If it can be passed on yet cannot be received, if it can be obtained yet not seen, if it is the **self-originating root** (自本自根), before Heaven and Earth existed, since ancient times yet eternally preserved—then the **Dao of the Cavernous Deities** (神鬼、神帝), the **Dao that generates Heaven and Earth**, is the **Chángdào**.\n\nThe **five-thousand-word essence** (五千文) is unfolded from these few words, truly the **mysterious within the mysterious**, the **divine within the divine**.\n\n**Naming and the Dao/Way**:\nThe Dao, when it can be named, is **not** the **Chángdào**.\nThe Dao is **embodiment** (体). Naming is **application** (用). Application arises from embodiment, and naming comes from the Dao. Once its name is marked, it can be applied. The application being established, it is called **the Dao that can be named**.\n\nOnce the **Dao that can be named** is applied, it is **no longer the Chángdào**. The **Chángdào** is the **name of application without bounds**, fragmenting its virtue/power.\n\n**Yán Jùnpíng** said: The **Dao that can be named** is the **Dao of virtue/power** made manifest, yet it is **not** the innate truth.\n\n**Lì Zǐ** (列子) dwelled in the **Jìng** (郑) garden for forty years, and no one recognized him. The king and ministers treated him like the common folk—this is truly the **Dao of guarding the Chángdào**.\n\nThe **beginning of Heaven and Earth** is **nameless** (无名). The **nameless** refers to the Dao. Before all transformations, there was no way to force a name upon it. When the **marvelous origin** (妙本) first descended, the **primordial simplicity** (浑沦之朴) was about to depart, and then the **Great Polarity** (太极) of the *Yì* (易) emerged, giving rise to the **Two Principles** (两仪).\n\n**Yán Jùnpíng** said: The **nameless** is **without traces** (无朕), merging with the divine embodiment, the world relying upon it yet unaware of its transformation from **voidness** (虚无), making it the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**—this is the **embodiment of the Dao**.\n\nThe **named** (有名) is the **mother of all things**. The **named** refers to **Heaven and Earth**. Heaven’s bestowal and Earth’s transformation nurture all things. They shelter and harm them like a mother nurturing her children. Hence it is called the **named**, the **mother of all things**.\n\nThe **Great Dao** is mysterious and remote—how could it be confined to the **named** or the **nameless**? The sage **simplifies application to establish teachings**, thereby clarifying the **similarities and differences** of the **origin and traces**.\n\nAll **Dao that is renewed daily** is said to be **nameless**. Hence, the **beginning of all things** is the **nameless**. The **completion of all things** is the **named**.\n\n**Yán Jùnpíng** said: The **named** is the **Dao of transformation**. Revering the Dao and valuing the divine, following the **Great Harmony** (太和), then Heaven and Earth become the **mother of all things**—this is the **application of the Dao**.\n\n**Always without desire**, one may observe its **mystery** (妙);\n**Always with desire**, one may observe its **boundaries** (徼).\n\n**Desire** (欲) is the **pursuit of sensory realms** that generates the mind.\n**Mystery** (妙) is the **essence of the utmost subtlety**.\n**Boundary** (徼) is the **edge and corner**.\n\nThe **Great Dao** has small paths at its boundaries—these are called **boundaries**. It is also **return**.\nThe **Dao of voidness** (虚无) is **still and unmoving**—this is called **without desire**.\nWhen it **senses and gives birth to all things**, it is called **with desire**.\n**Without desire** is observing the **mystery** while guarding the **voidness**.\n**With desire** is observing the **boundaries**—this is called **retaining thought** (存思).\n\nIt has been said that **true constancy** (真常) is the **Great Dao** itself.\n**Without desire** and **with desire** are the **Dao’s applications**.\nThe Dao originally has **no form**—**form** arises when the Dao is sensed and generated.\nWhat is **above form** is called the Dao.\nWhat is **below form** is called **instrumentality** (器).\n\nThe **superior person** (上士) knows the **subtle** and the **manifest**, seeing what is **not yet formed** and already exhausting its **mystery**—hence, **always without desire**, they observe its **mystery**.\nThe **middle person** (中士) follows and adapts to things, seeing their **clusters and masses** (群村), and thus obtains their **application**—hence, though there are **ten thousand differences**, the **true principle** (真理) is unfathomable, but they merely **glimpse its boundaries**.\n\nAnother elucidation states:\nIf a person **always embodies the subtle essence of the Great Dao**, guards the **key to stillness** (清静之要), and returns to the **extreme of life and vitality** (性命之极), not being seduced by external things, then their **intentions and will** (志意) become **pure and vast** (虚澹), able to observe the **Dao’s utmost mystery** and the **Dao’s ultimate boundaries**.\n\n**Yán Jùnpíng** said:\nWhen the **mind is like metal or stone** (金石), the **body is like the wood of the *jú* tree** (桔木), and one **silently dwells in the corners** (隅隅), with **intentions as gentle as a colt** (驹犊)—this is the **person without desire**, returning to the **root of life and vitality**.",

      "translated_text": "The person with desire consumes the boundaries of things and loses the path of ease and openness.\nThey see only the petty edges of the net, lost and unable to return, forfeiting the true origin.\n\nSome ancient sages said that those without desire embody the Dao inwardly, observing transformation without attachment to any form or trace, forgetting their own origins.\n\nThose with desire, however, arise from the root and apply its use to what can be spoken of—establishing teachings to respond to things, accomplishing the salvation of myriad affairs. They perceive the end of things and know their return, first speaking of restraining oneself, then of transforming the people. Cultivating oneself and governing the state—these two are the same.\n\nIn principle, nothing is lacking. These two are the same—what can be spoken of and what can be named, the unnamed and the named, desirelessness and desire. All are contained within the still, motionless, and profound source, where essence and function remain indistinct, and good and evil are both extinguished. Hence, they are said to be the same.\n\nYet when they manifest, they take on different names. By \"manifest,\" it means descending from the root to expound what can be spoken of in gradual stages. Though originating from one mind, the applications of the Five Constants differ, and the wise and foolish vary and transform. Lifespans, fortune, and existence all differ—each takes on its own name.\n\nThe same is called the Mysterious. The Mysterious again, the Mysterious—this is profound and subtle, obscure and natural. What is called \"natural\" is the Way.\n\nIt is said that both the unnamed and the named, desirelessness and desire, all receive *qi* from Heaven and examine nature’s essence. Pure and impure, honored and humiliated, forms take on myriad shapes—this arises from the Mysterious again, the Mysterious, the Divine again, the Divine. This is what is called \"naturally so.\"\n\nIf one penetrates and comprehends this profound subtlety, piercing the silent and obscure, this is called possessing *Xuándé* (玄德). It is the gateway to all marvels—meaning the realm of the Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and unbounded, with no barriers or confines, no doors or walls—it is boundless and resplendent. When speaking of self-cultivation, outwardly it aligns with the common people, inwardly it becomes the wondrous root. When teaching, the myriad truths emerge from subtlety, and the sages contain subtlety within. Transformation and guidance have no fixed method; profound and singular, it stands alone and unchanging—this is called *Zhīcháng* (知常).\n\nSince there are ways of emergence and return, it is called the *Gate*. Zhuangzi said:\n*\"There is birth and there is death,\nThere is exit and there is entry.\nExit and entry without seeing its form—\nThis is called the Heavenly Gate.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Gate is the state of *wu* (無有, non-being).\nAll things emerge from non-being—\nThis is also called the gateway to all marvels.\n\nOnly the Marvelous Dao gives rise to all things.\nWhat gives rise to all things is surely the Marvelous Dao.\nThose who use the Dao are surely the sages.\nThe sage’s Dao renews itself daily, its applications boundless—\nHence, it is called *Cháng* (常, the Constant).\n\nEmergence and retreat have boundaries;\nDesire for difference leads to action—\nHence, it is called *kě* (可, permissible).\n\nWhat can be spoken of must be named;\nWhat is named must be known—\nHence, it follows with *\"All under Heaven know.\"*\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThen ugliness already exists.\nAll know goodness as goodness—\nThen ungoodness already exists.\n\nBeauty and goodness arise from deluded emotions.\nWhat one’s emotions favor becomes beauty;\nWhat one’s emotions reject becomes ugliness.\nIf one indulges deluded emotions, what is not ugliness?\n\nWhat one takes as right becomes goodness;\nWhat one takes as wrong becomes ungoodness.\nIf one indulges in one’s own right and wrong,\nHow can there be true beauty?\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Is and is-not—this is what I call emotions.\nWhat I call without-emotion is:\nPeople do not harm themselves with their likes and dislikes,\nAlways following nature without artificial enhancement.\nThis is called stopping at what is truly fitting.\"*\n\nThe sage is not without beauty and goodness—\nRather, they possess it without boasting,\nThus aligning with non-being.\nNot boasting preserves virtue intact;\nAligning with non-being keeps harm at bay.\nVirtue preserved, harm distant—\nThen beauty and goodness are complete.\n\nIf one uses beauty and goodness to transform the world,\nMaking them know beauty as beauty—\nThis is not yet perfect goodness.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The highest virtue does not cling to virtue;\nThe lower virtue does not lose virtue.\"*\nThis is correct.\n\nMoreover, good people are few under Heaven,\nWhile ungood people are many.\nIf one corrects their governance and secretly mocks them,\nThis becomes evil.\n\nYán Jùnpíng said:\n*\"The bright does not always endure;\nThe obscure does not always vanish.\nHonor and decay begin in late spring,\nWild plants and grains sprout at the autumn equinox.\nOn the winter solstice, all things flourish;\nOn the summer solstice, all things wither.\nIt is said that prosperity must yield to decline,\nAnd beauty must yield to ugliness.\nEven yin and yang follow this—\nHow much more so for humans?\"*\n\nThis is a warning against those who boast in beauty and goodness.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLength and shortness define each other,\nHigh and low incline against each other,\nSounds harmonize with each other,\nFront and back follow each other.\n\nThese six principles, when one boasts in beauty and goodness, lead to action.\nOnce action is manifest, partial fixation arises,\nAnd mutual destruction and harm emerge—\nThings lose their nature.\nHence, it concludes with the sage’s *wuwei*,\nAnd *Xuándé* does not depart.\n\nThe nature of being and non-being\nOriginally does not give rise to each other.\nYet it is said that being must emerge from non-being,\nAnd non-being must arise from being—\nHence, *\"being and non-being give rise to each other.\"*\n\nThe principle of difficulty and ease\nOriginally does not complete each other.\nFor instance, the potter finds clay easy to shape\nBut wood difficult to work.\nThe carpenter finds wood easy to shape\nBut altars difficult to construct.\nIf one tries to make the easy difficult,\nIt will not succeed.\nIf each sticks to their craft,\nIt will be accomplished—\nHence, *\"difficulty and ease complete each other.\"*\n\nLength and shortness\nOriginally do not define each other.\nSeeing a crane, one knows the hare’s legs are short;\nObserving a hare, one knows the crane’s legs are long.\nThings follow this pattern—\nHence, *\"length and shortness define each other.\"*\n\nHigh and low\nOriginally do not incline against each other.\nIf one lacks sufficient rank,\nThen the desire for usurpation arises.\nIf one is high but not arrogant,\nThen none will seek to humble them.\nIf one is low but not abased,\nThen none will seek to exalt them.\nIf one aspires and envies, striving to surpass others,\nThen all will topple each other—\nHence, *\"high and low incline against each other.\"*",

follow each other,\nBeginning and end reverse and repeat,\nUnseparable, beyond evasion by the numinous,\nUnopposed by yin and yang.\n\nFrom this, it is seen:\nThe affairs of the Sage-King\nCannot be achieved through contrived action.\n\nThus, the Sage acts in *wuwei*,\nPractices the teaching of *non-speech*.\nThis speaks of the ancient Sage-Kings,\nWho did not govern the world through beauty and virtue,\nYet the world governed itself.\n*Wuwei* is not idle inaction or silent withdrawal—\nIt is the forgetting of beauty and virtue,\nThe annihilation of emotion, the return to true nature,\nWhere the people act according to their abilities,\nThings settle into their proper order,\nAnd none disturb the harmony above or below.\nThus, the teaching of *non-speech* is carried out—\nBy leading with one’s own conduct,\nRectifying one’s bearing to enlighten things,\nActing in accordance with the times,\nUtilizing resources to achieve merit,\nAnd aligning with the principle of *forgetting speech*.\n\nAll things act without complaint.\n*Action* is movement.\nThe Sage governs the world with *youshou* (nurturing),\nDoing nothing, yet nothing is undone—\nThus the people till and eat,\nWeave and clothe themselves,\nRest content in their homes,\nAnd play with full bellies.\nThey take joy in their natural inclinations,\nAll drinking from the transformation of *wuwei*.\nThus the Sage entrusts them without complaint.\nThe people can be led along a path,\nBut cannot be made to know its purpose.\nThis is the wind of *upper virtue not claiming virtue*.\n\nTo give birth without possession,\nTo act without reliance,\nTo complete deeds without taking credit—\nAll things arise and transform on their own,\nStanding alone and self-so,\nNot claimed as one’s own.\nAll creatures pursue their nature,\nEach adapting to its kind,\nNot relying on their own virtue.\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,\nThe Way permeates all things,\nThe mind wanders in the Maoshu Mountains,\nNot lording over the people.\nThis is the complete virtue of the Sage.\n\nOnly by not claiming\nDoes one not depart.\nThe Sage’s deeds are like those of Creation,\nAllowing all things to reach their utmost,\nForgetting name and self.\nNot claiming means not taking position as one’s own,\nThus the people are unaware, unknowing—\nHence, their Way does not perish,\nTheir virtue does not fade.\n\n*The Honglie Explanation* says:\nWhen the Chu did not appoint Zi Fa to attack Cai,\nHe was praised, and King Xuan of Chu welcomed him at the border,\nGranting him a hundred *mu* of land and sealing him with a jade tablet.\nZi Fa declined, saying:\n*\"To govern a state and establish policies,\nTo receive vassal lords as guests—\nThis is the virtue of the ruler.\nTo issue commands and the

rank and rewards—\nThis is not the Way of ren and yi.*\nThus he declined and did not accept it.\nThis is *completing deeds without claiming them.*\"\n\nKnowledge brings the mutual birth of good and evil,\nThe incline of high and low cannot be escaped.\nDifficulty and ease stand opposed,\nThe talents of long and short cannot be concealed.\nWhen long and short are revealed, the worthy are praised—\nHence, it is followed by *not praising the worthy*.\nNot praising the worthy prevents the people from contending.\nIf the ruler is humble, yielding, and tranquil,\nNot boasting of his own virtue,\nThen the people’s transformation follows like wind bending grass,\nAnd who would dare to contend?\n*The Classic* says:\n*\"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people rectify themselves.\"*\n\nAnother explanation says:\nIf the ruler is tranquil,\nThe ministers are enlightened,\nPunishments do not spare the noble,\nGrace does not exclude

master of great virtue,\nThe commoner is the servant of lesser virtue.\nThe worthy are not one in ten thousand,\nThe Sage does not appear in every age.\nHeaven’s creation of the worthy and unworthy\nIs not by praising them.\n\nAgain, it is said:\nLike driving a poor horse and a fine steed together on a level road,\nOr letting a wild goose and a quail fly side by side in the blue sky—\nThen the worthy and unworthy become clear.\nThis is natural, not by praising them.\n\nNot valuing rare treasures\nPrevents the people from stealing.\nRare treasures are gold, jade, pearls, and rhinoceros horn.\nIf the ruler’s transformation is pure and tranquil,\nThe people focus on farming and learning,\nHiding gold in the mountains,\nDiscarding pearls in the depths,\nFinding no profit in wealth,\nNo attraction in nobility—\nThen the people will have no heart for theft.\nAnother explanation says:\nThe black dragon’s night-light pearls,\nGold, jade, brocade, and embroidery—\nIf the ruler does not value them,\nThe people will not covet them,\nAnd where would thieves come from?\nThe saying goes:\n*\"If a person does not desire it,\nEven if rewarded, they will not steal.\"*\n\n*The

      "translated_text": "When women reach adulthood yet remain uneducated,\nThe world will have those who suffer from cold.\n\nThus, the ruler himself plows,\nHis wife weaves,\nSetting an example for all under heaven.\nThis is how he guides the people—\nBy not valuing rare treasures,\nBy making desirable things unseen,\nSo that the people’s hearts remain undisturbed.\n\nDesirable things are those external objects\nThat bewilder the mind,\nGiving rise to covetous and lustful desires.\nYet \"not seeing\" does not mean distant isolation—\nIt means not letting perception become perception,\nBut embracing *wuwei* instead.\n\nIf the ruler beholds external things\nYet harbors no covetous or lustful desires,\nThen he is untouched by the defilements of form,\nAnd his original nature returns to purity and tranquility—\nTo its true, singular essence.\n\nWhen the ruler preserves this true singularity,\nThe people’s hearts remain undisturbed,\nAnd the winds of simplicity and sincerity can flourish.\n\n**Jun Ping** says:\nIf the world does not honor the worthy,\nThe people will not strive,\nAnd without striving, there will be no contention,\nAnd without contention, there will be no disorder.\nIf the world does not value wealth,\nThe people will not desire it,\nAnd without desire, there will be no seeking,\nAnd without seeking, there will be no theft.\nIf the world abandons the pleasures of music and dance,\nThe people will have no joy,\nAnd without joy, there will be no licentiousness.\nThis is the natural order of things.\n\n*The Honglie Explanation* says:\n**Ordering Yin Zi Pei** to drink with King Zhuang of Chu,\nThe king agreed.\nZi Pei stood with loose sleeves, facing north in the hall,\nThinking: *\"The king once granted this, yet now does not fulfill it—\nPerhaps I have erred?\"*\n\nThe king replied:\n*\"I have heard of your Strong Terrace.\nThat terrace overlooks the Liang Mountains,\nFacing the vast expanse,\nWith the river to its left and the Huai to its right—\nIts pleasures make one forget life and death.\nA man of my meager virtue cannot bear such delights.\nI fear if I linger, I may never return.\nThus, the saying: 'Make desirable things unseen,\nSo that the heart remains undisturbed.'\"*\n\n**Transmission of Yi’s *Yin Yi*** says:\nThe ancient text reads *\"make the people’s hearts undisturbed,\"*\nBut the He Shang Gong *Kaoyuan* edition reads *\"make the heart undisturbed,\"*\nWhich is also acceptable.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance begins with emptying the heart—\nFirst purifying oneself,\nThen extending to family and state.\nEmptying the heart means harboring no wicked thoughts.\nNot forcing the mind to chase after darkness,\nYet inwardly quelling desires,\nDispelling all attachments,\nSo that the mind naturally settles—\nThis is emptiness.\n\nAs Zhuangzi says:\n*\"In an empty chamber, white purity arises—\nA blessing of stillness.\nStillness means the heart is empty,\nAnd pristine whiteness brings fortune to dwell.\"*\n\n**Filling the belly.**\nThe Sage’s virtue and power internally suffuse,\nThe five spirits remain tranquil,\nContentment is self-sufficient,\nAnd no attachment to wealth or love arises—\nThus, *\"filling the belly.\"*\n\n**Weakening the will.**\nThe will is the mind’s affair.\nWhat the mind pursues is called will.\nTo act with the mind,\nOne must uphold humility, stillness, gentleness, and weakness—\nThen the Dao is complete.\n\n**Strengthening the bones.**\nBones are the body’s framework.\nWhen purity and harmony are sufficient,\nThe body is nourished,\nAnd when vital essence is robust,\nThe bones grow strong—\nThis too is natural law.\n\n**Always keeping the people in ignorance and desirelessness.**\nThe Sage constantly cultivates himself, emptying his heart,\nSo that the people may return to simplicity and sincerity,\nAnd transform naturally with joy.\n\nThe saying goes:\n*\"If one rectifies himself,\nWhat need has he for governance?\"*\nThus, even those who possess knowledge or cunning,\nOr who adorn themselves with deceit,\nAre already influenced by the winds of purity and sincerity,\nTheir hearts grow dull,\nTheir bodies wither—\nThey dare not stir,\nAnd all desires for action fade.\n\n**To act with *wuwei* is to govern perfectly.**\nTo act with *wuwei* means to follow the Way of non-action.\nNon-action means not exceeding one’s natural endowment.\nIf one does not exceed nature,\nThen natural order is preserved,\nAnd all actions become non-action.\n\nWhen all things act without contrivance,\nThe hearts of covetousness and seeking vanish entirely,\nAnd the winds of simplicity prevail—\nWho could say governance fails?\n\nTo honor one’s own worth and ability makes the people follow,\nBut to indulge in contention and theft stirs the desires that breed chaos.\nOnly the Sage governs through emptiness and openness,\nThus he follows with the *chong* of the Dao.\n\nThe *chong* of the Dao,\nWhen applied, is never full.\n*\"Full\"* in the ancient text means *\"satisfied.\"*\n*Chong* means emptiness.\nIt also means centrality—\nAn indefinite term,\nAnd also constancy.\nThe Dao’s use lies in its emptiness—\nHarmonious *qi* is empty and open,\nThus it flows universally.\nThe ruler who attains this emptiness\nLoses his wealth in a thousand chariots,\nWhile the common man, attaining it,\nForgets his poverty in a single room.\nThough seated in the temple halls,\nHis heart is as still as in a mountain cave;\nThough dressed in coarse rags,\nHe does not differ from the adorned in fine silks—\nThis is the profound attainment of emptiness,\nAnd the absence of fullness.\n\n**Jun Ping** says:\nThose who *do* emptiness are not empty,\nThose who *do* harmony are not harmonious.\nOnly by *not* doing emptiness and harmony\nDoes one truly attain emptiness and harmony.\nEmptiness takes emptiness as its dwelling,\nHarmony takes non-action as its home.\nTo be able to empty and to be non-action—\nThis is the excess of emptiness,\nTo be able to be non-action and to empty—\nThis is the constancy of harmony.\nThus, one truly attains the Great Dao,\nThe use of emptiness and harmony without fullness.\n\nThe central way lies in harmony.\nSome dare not establish it—\nThis refers to the Dao itself.\n\nDeep, like the source of all things.\n*Deep* means profound stillness.\n*Fu* is the rhythmic intonation of Daoist chant.\nUnderstanding this,\nThe Dao of emptiness is neither deficient nor excessive,\nIts nature is concentrated and serene—\nDeep, unfathomable—\nThus it is called *deep*.\n\nThe logic of the unfathomable\nIs neither being nor non-being,\nDifficult to name,\nThus it is spoken of metaphorically.\nDaily life flows naturally,\nLike water in a vessel—\nSerene and profound,\nEncompassing all phenomena,\nPreserving both good and evil,\nNurturing all movement and growth—\nThus it is the source of all things.\n\n**Dulling the sharp, unraveling the tangled.**\n*Dulling* means restraining.\nIt also means breaking the edge—\n*Sharp* refers to keen ambition,\nAnd also to forward momentum.\n*Unraveling* means dispersing,\n*Tangled* means excessive agitation.\nThose who advance eagerly for fame and gain\nShould reflect on the Dao’s emptiness,\nRestrain their greed and delusion,\nAnd not exalt themselves.",

contemplation,\nOne might suppose I emerged before the Celestial Emperor.\n\nIf one employs the Dao’s emptiness and balance,\nThen the *deep* (渊) is never full,\nAnd blending with light and dust,\nThus it becomes the source of all things.\n\nSeeking its source, it precedes Heaven and Earth—\nHence the mention of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not kind,\nYet they treat all things as fodder for sacrifice.\nThe Sage is not kind,\nYet he treats the people as fodder for sacrifice.\n*Fodder* (刍) means grass—\nBound into bundles for ritual offerings.\nIn ancient times, it was

from divine purpose,\nYet the divine has no need for the fodder.\nNo need means no partiality,\nNo partiality means no favoritism—\nHence, Heaven and Earth have no favoritism,\nYet great benevolence

sentiment,\nView all things as fodder for sacrifice,\nDemanding no gratitude in return.\nThe Sage, lacking sentiment,\nViews the people as fodder for sacrifice,\nDemanding no gratitude in return.\nThis is the natural way of Heaven and Earth.\n\nMaster Rong Ping said:\nHeaven is high and clear, Earth is thick and yielding—\nThe interplay of Yin and Yang,\nBalanced *qi* flowing,\nNaturally effortless, yet all things arise.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not strain their hearts or minds,\nNor exhaust their spirits in laborious deeds,\nNor weep in excessive affection,\nNor bestow favors with calculated gain,\nNor shower blessings to demand repayment—\nYet all things are nurtured and fulfilled.\nThis is what is meant by:\nHeaven and Earth are not kind,\nYet they treat all things as fodder for sacrifice.\n\nEnlightened kings and sagely rulers\nHold the Dao’s unity and harmony,\nTheir clarity and stillness unchanging,\nYet they adapt in all transformations—\nDivine and effortless,\nTheir actions aligned with the Dao,\nThe world responds, all things naturally evolve.\n\nThe Sage does not exhaust his wisdom or abilities,\nNor disturb his heart with restless schemes,\nNor drain his vital essence in ceaseless toil,\nNor fixate on endless calculations,\nNor flaunt his benevolence in public displays,\nNor lead the people with contrived affection—\nYet virtue spreads universally,\nAnd the realm unites in peace,\nHis kindness reaches to all corners,\nHis deeds are fully accomplished—\nFor what is the art of benevolence and kindness?\n\nThings rely on their allotted measure for transformation,\nYet the Dao’s boundless operations\nGrant measure to the boundless,\nEndowing it with inexhaustible power—\nIf they do not sustain each other,\nIt is like a river drying up,\nAnd the land withering in its wake.\n*Again it is said:*\nEven lice stirring on the hair\nCause sleep to be unsettled.\nMosquitoes settling on the skin\nDistract the mind,\nAnd obstruct clear thought.\nExternal harm from venomous insects\nPierces the heart with pain,\nYet the damage ends at the ears and eyes,\nAnd all limbs grow sluggish.\nThis shows that affection and gain\nStored in the chest\nCannot but bring strain, imbalance, and depletion of vital *qi*.\n\nExcessive words lead to exhaustion,\nBetter to uphold the Center.\n*Excessive words* refers to excessive talk of universal love—\nToo much leads to difficulty in execution,\nThus, words run dry, bending under strain,\nYet if one follows Heaven and Earth’s emptiness and stillness,\nAnd the *bell bellows* (橐钥)’s heartless nature,\nEmbracing the Center’s harmony,\nAll will naturally suffice.\nIt is also the teaching of *non-action* (不言之教).\n\nThe *Honglie Explanation* (《鸿烈解》) says:\nMaster Wang Shou carried his books while walking,\nAnd encountered Xu Feng in Zhou.\nXu Feng said:\n*Action* (事) arises from responding to change,\nChange comes from the times,\nThus, those who know the times act without

      "translated_text": "「The principle of non-death is both profoundly obscure and capable of nurturing as a mother.\nSome liken the *valley* to Heaven and Earth,\nAnd *spirit* to the Great Dao.\nNow, those who speak use the analogy of mountain valleys echoing in response—\nIs this not a small comparison?\n\nMoreover, if a person can embrace openness without limits,\nConform to the boundless scope of the Great Emptiness,\nPreserve the true and genuine *spirit*,\nAnd draw upon the vitality of *creation*,\nThen naturally their form aligns with the Dao—\nWhat is there of death to speak of?\nThus, in obscurity, they flourish and nurture,\nAnd all things receive their blessing—\nThis is called the *mysterious female*.\n\nRiver Above Master’s *Commentary* states:\nThe sound of the *valley* (谷) is *nurturing* (育).\nThe *mysterious female* is nurturance itself.\nIf a person can nurture their *spirit*, they will not die.\nBy *spirit*, they mean the *spirits* of the five *viscera* (五藏):\nThe liver harbors the *hun* (魂),\nThe lungs harbor the *po* (魄),\nThe heart harbors the *spirit* (神),\nThe kidneys harbor the *jing* (精),\nThe spleen harbors the *zhi* (志).\nIf a person can maintain purity, stillness, and emptiness,\nTo nurture their *spirit* without being stained by desires,\nAnd keep their form intact and *spirit* complete—\nThen they will not die.\nIf, however, they indulge in emotions and become entangled,\nDisturbed by all phenomena,\nTheir form becomes impaired and their *spirit* departs—\nHow could the Dao persist?\n\nThe *gateway* of the *mysterious female*\nIs called the *root of Heaven and Earth*.\nFor all things emerge and return through the Great Emptiness and *creation*.\nSince there is the name of *emergence and return*,\nIt is thus called the *gateway*.\nBy *root*, they mean *origin*.\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast,\nThey cannot evade having form—\nAll things of form rely on the Great Emptiness and harmony as their origin,\nHence, it is called the *root of Heaven and Earth*.\nRiver Above Master says:\nThe way to non-death lies within the *mysterious female*.\n*Xuan* (玄) is Heaven,\nIn humans, it is the *nose*.\n*Pin* (牝) is Earth,\nIn humans, it is the *mouth*.\nHeaven nourishes humans with the five *qi* (五气),\nEntering through the nose and stored in the heart—\nThese five *qi*, pure and refined, become the *spirit* of intelligence,\nThe clarity of hearing and voice,\nAnd the five *natures* (性),\nTheir *ghostly* aspect being the *hun*.\nThe *hun* is masculine.\nIt governs the entering and exiting of *qi* through the nose,\nConnecting with Heaven—\nThus, the nose is called *xuan*.\nEarth nourishes humans with the five *flavors* (五味),\nEntering through the mouth and stored in the stomach—\nThese five flavors, coarse and impure, become the *form* of bones, flesh, and blood,\nThe six *emotions* (情),\nTheir *ghostly* aspect being the *po*.\nThe *po* is feminine.\nIt governs the entering and exiting of *qi* through the mouth,\nConnecting with Earth—\nThus, the mouth is called *pin*.\nBy *root*, they mean *primordial* (元).\nThe gateway of the nose and mouth\nIs where the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth\nFlows in and out.\n\nThe earlier statement that the *spirit of the valley* does not die\nEncourages people to understand the principle of nurturing the *spirit*.\nThis passage on the *gateway of the mysterious female*\nIllustrates the further development of refining the form.\nThus, those who perfect both form and *spirit*\nAre the ones who can align with the Dao.\n\nWhen humans have a body and a *spirit*,\nThen there is life and death.\nLife and death cannot be spoken of as the Dao.\nFlowing and changing without constancy—\nHow could it be called *stillness*?\n\nIf one empties their form and *spirit*,\nForgets distinctions of self and other,\nThen emergence has no root—\nThus, *qi* gathers without being called life,\nAnd return has no orifice—\nThus, *qi* disperses without being called death.\nNeither life nor death—\nThis is the *spirit of the valley*.\nLife and death without constancy—\nThis is the floating and changing of things.\nProfound stillness, feminine tranquility,\nSerene and unmoving—\nThis is the *mysterious female*.\n\nContinuous as if ever-present,\nYet effortless in its application.\nContinuous—\nThe appearance of ceaselessness—\nThis concludes the meaning of nurturing the *spirit* and refining the form.\n\nTo nurture the *spirit* is to reach profound mystery and obscurity,\nPurity, stillness, and emptiness,\nContinuous as if ever-present,\nResponding to things without ceasing.\nTo refine the form is to breathe the Great Harmony,\nGuide and connect the blood and *qi*,\nDrink the *elixir* of the endless spring,\nChew the herbs of longevity,\nAnd ensure the limbs and joints remain unobstructed without labor—\nOnly then can one align with the roots of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd share the gateway with all marvels.\n\nThe *valley* is the Great Emptiness,\n*Creation* is the *spirit*—\nThe *mysterious female* nurtures all things,\nContinuous and unending—\nThus, it is followed by the saying *Heaven endures, Earth persists*.\n\n*Heaven endures, Earth persists*—\nA standard.\nHeaven, through its vast *qi* and forms,\nHas not tilted from ancient times to now,\nHence it is called *enduring*.\nEarth, through its solid substance and capacity,\nRemains eternally steadfast and unchanging,\nHence it is called *persisting*.\nThis concludes the analogy and establishes its meaning in the following text.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure and persist\nBecause they do not generate themselves—\nThus, they can achieve eternal life.\nThis concludes the meaning.\n\nHeaven endures in purity,\nEarth persists in tranquility,\nBecause they cover and nourish all things,\nAnd extend their nurturing to all beings—\nYet they all draw upon the wondrous origin,\nReturn to the boundless void,\nAnd restore to the profound stillness,\nWithout boasting of their own creative power,\nAnd thus they uphold their constant *virtue*—\nHence, they can endure and persist eternally.\n\nAnother interpretation says:\nHeaven, Earth, and all things\nTransform uniquely and naturally,\nAll discerning their own essence,\nYet none seeking to prolong or augment their life—\nThus, they can endure and persist eternally.\nThis is a solemn warning.\n\nHence, the Sage follows his own body while his body precedes others,\nSets aside his body while his body remains.\nThe Sage acts without action,\nHis body in the hall of state,\nYet his mind wanders in *Maoshu* (姑射).\nHe follows the pattern of Heaven and Earth’s covering and nurturing,\nAnd distributes nourishment impartially.\nHe has greatness yet practices humility,\nAnd does not dare to take precedence over the world.\nHis people delight in his guidance without wearying of its joy,\nThey are pushed forward without resentment—\nThus, his body precedes others.\nHe can also forget his merits and name,\nSet aside his body and reduce his desires.\nThe world loves him as a father and mother,\nThe *spirit* and clarity of Heaven protect him as an innocent child—\nThus, his body remains.\n\nIs it not because he has no self-interest?\nHence, he can achieve his own interests.\nHeaven and Earth generate all things,\nYet the Sage, setting aside himself, benefits all people—\nNone rely on their own benevolence,\nHow could there be a heart of self-interest?\nIt is truly without self-interest.\nWithout self-interest, he can endure and persist,\nAnd because he endures and persists,\nHe is like one who can achieve his own interests.\n\nMaster Li Yue says:\nHe who does not selfishly hoard for himself,\nYet gives generously to others—\nOthers’ selfishness may not succeed,\nBut his own will be fulfilled.\n\n*The Profound and Distinct Interpretation* says:\nWhen Gongyi Xiu governed Lu,\nHe loved fish,\nAnd when the entire state offered fish to him,\nHe did not accept it.\nHis disciples remonstrated:\n“Master, you love fish—\nWhy do you not accept it?”\nHe replied:\n“It is precisely because I love fish,\nThat I do not accept it.”」",

      "translated_text": "「Again, this is about *governance* (治). *Truly sharp* (锐) means *keen and cutting* (铦利). It speaks of how people know only of their sharp, greedy desires, yet pursue wealth and honor with reckless abandon, yet fail to discern the calculated folly (揣度) of their passions, and to govern themselves with moderation (思治侨恣). When misfortune comes, it cannot be long preserved.\n\nMaster Yan Junping (君平) said: *\"Wealth and honor to me are like ascending a mountain to gaze endlessly—*\n*Power and status pass like a fleeting bolt of lightning.*\nThis is to say they cannot be long preserved.\"\n\n*The *Honglie Jie* (《鸿烈解》) records: White Gongsheng (白公胜) seized a state’s treasury but could not distribute its wealth. After seven days, Shi Qi (石乞) entered and said: *\"What is gained unjustly cannot be kept, and if you cannot share it, disaster will surely come.\"* Unable to give to others, he only brought harm to himself. White Gongsheng did not heed this warning. On the ninth day, Ye Gong (叶公) arrived and opened the treasury’s stores to distribute among the people, while also raising taxes to fund soldiers. White Gongsheng attacked him, but nineteen days later, he was captured.\n\nTo claim a state that is not rightfully yours,\nYet fail to share its wealth,\nIs to be the most avaricious (至贪).\nTo take without giving to others,\nYet lack the wisdom to benefit oneself,\nIs to be the most foolish (至愚).\nCompare White Gongsheng’s fate to the *Ur* (臬) who loved his son—\nHow different is it?\n\nThus it is said:\n*Holding yet overflowing* (持而盈之) is not as good as *early cessation* (其已),\n*Measuring yet sharpening* (揣而锐之) cannot be long preserved.\nGold and jade fill the halls,\nYet none can keep them.\nThis illustrates the inevitable truth:\n*Fullness cannot be long held.*\n\nGold and jade in a chamber\nMay only moisten the house,\nYet when a great thief arrives,\nHe will seize baskets and bags in haste,\nThough wise men may dwell within,\nNone can guard them.\nThus even beasts know this—\nThe elephant fears the hunter’s blade and loses its tusks,\nThe rooster dreads sacrifice and sheds its tail.\nEven beasts recognize this,\nYet how do humans fail to reflect?\n\nMaster Yan Junping (严君平) and Wang Bi (王弼) wrote: *\"Gold and jade fill the chamber\"* (金玉满室).\nWealth and honor, if indulged in excess (侨),\nBring ruin upon oneself.\n*遗* (遗) means *to bestow* (与).\nWealth invites others to seek it,\nSo one easily deceives himself.\nHonor makes others subservient,\nSo one easily oppresses others.\nDeceit and oppression grow daily,\nDisaster and blame will surely follow—\nThis ruin is self-inflicted, is it not?\n\nMaster Yan Junping (君平) further said:\n*\"Gold and jade harm the body,*\n*Status and power corrupt the spirit—*\nLike ice and fire,\nThey cannot coexist.\"\nThus, *status is the spirit’s impurity* (名者神之秽),\n*wealth is the body’s harm* (利者身之害).\nNurturing the spirit’s impurity,\nAccumulating the body’s harm,\nDamages what is already achieved,\nAnd aids what is already flawed.\nGaining them brings benefit,\nLosing them brings ruin—\nThen one’s thoughts are muddled,\nAnd his discernment of gain and loss is perverse.\n\nAgain he said:\n*\"Those who increase my wealth*\n*Diminish my spirit,*\n*Those who bring me fame*\n*Destroy my body.*\nMisfortune arises from within myself,\nNot from others.\nFortune arises from within myself,\nNot from heaven.\"*\n\nMaster Lu Xisheng (陆希声) said:\n*\"To hold a great office yet overflow with arrogance (满盈),*\nThough one fears it,\nIt is better to cease early.\nTo occupy a high position yet exceed its limits (亢极),*\nThough one worries,\nIt is better to withdraw early.\nTo calculate power and wealth yet sharpen one’s ambitions (锐意),*\nThough one gains them,\nThey cannot be preserved forever.\nTo hoard gold and jade while the halls overflow,*\nThough one possesses them,\nThey cannot be kept long.\nIf one is honored yet extravagant (侨), he invites disaster;\nIf one is wealthy yet extravagant (侨), he multiplies his faults.\nHubris grows within the heart,\nAnd its punishment comes from oneself—\nWhy blame heaven or reproach others?\"*\n\n*\"Great deeds accomplished,*\n*Fame secured,*\n*Then step back—*\nThis is the Dao of heaven.\nWhoever understands this,\nKnowing when to advance and retreat,\nTo preserve or perish,\nIs the Sage indeed.\nExternal fullness injures life—\nRather than sharpen one’s focus on wealth and honor,\nIt is better to embrace simplicity (抱一) and avoid blame,\nThus follows the teaching: *Carry the vital essence (营魄), embrace unity (抱一).*\n\n*Carrying the vital essence (载营魄), embracing unity (抱一),*\nCan one truly remain undivided?\n\nThe Daoists say:\n*The spirit of yang is called *hun* (魂),*\n*The hun delights in life,*\n*The shade of yin is called *po* (魄),*\n*The po favors death.*\n*The hun roams,*\n*The po remains still.*\n\n*The *Baihu Tong* (《白虎通》) states:*\n*\"The hun is the wandering essence,*\n*Qi is the undetermined form,*\nThus the hun is called *ying* (营).\"*\nThe old commentary says:\n*载* (载) means *to bear* (乘).\n*营* (营) refers to the *hun* (魂).\nIt is also said that *ying* (营) means *to protect the yang qi*.\nThe *hun* is the yang essence,\nThe *po* is the yin spirit.\nThe yang essence favors movement and wandering,\nThus Daoist scriptures speak of *restraining and retaining* (拘留).\nThe yin spirit favors agitation and deception,\nThus Daoist scriptures teach methods of *subduing and controlling* (制伏).\nIf one’s form and essence always bear the yang essence and yin spirit,\nAnd embrace the pure, unified *tàihé* (太和) *qi*,\nKeeping them from scattering,\nThen one may forever preserve longevity.\n\nThe Dao’s embrace of unity (抱一)\nIs like a *yì* (镒) containing its brilliance—\nCan brilliance ever separate from the mirror?\nThis teaches how to nurture the spirit (养神).\n\nNow I explain:\nIf one seeks to guard unity (抱一之卫),\nOne must keep the heart undivided.\nIf the heart remains undivided,\nThen it is bearing the *hun* and *po*,\nAnd embracing the pure, unified Dao.\nCan one be like an infant (婴儿)?\nThe following passages are all interpreted in this way.\n\n*Concentrating qi to achieve softness (专气致柔),*\nCan one be like an infant?\n\nThe old commentary says:\n*专* (专) means *unified* (一) and *to entrust* (任).\n*Qi* (气) is the *chōnghé miàoqì* (冲和妙气) of harmony and subtlety,\nAnd also the natural *qi* of the body.\nWhen a person stands alone, distinct from all else,\nHe receives the natural, harmonious, and subtle *qi*.\nAs *qi* descends and form is born,\nIt remains untainted and pure.\nIf one concentrates and entrusts oneself to this harmonious, subtle *qi*,\nForgets all perceptions and knowledge,\nThen *qi* will naturally remain pure and harmonious,\nAnd the body will naturally be soft and weak,\nUnharmed by the evils of others—\nThis is attaining the infant’s complete harmony.\nThis teaches how to nurture *qi* (养气).\n\nNow I explain:\n*\"Can one be like an infant?\"*\nIt means:\nIf one seeks to guard *qi* through concentration and softness (专气致柔之卫),\nOne must be like an infant in purity and harmony.\nIf one can be like an infant in purity and harmony,\nThen one has attained the guarding of *qi* through concentration and softness.\n\n*Washing away impurities, gazing into the profound (涤除玄览),*\nCan one be without blemish?\n\nThe old commentary says:\n*涤* (涤) means *to wash* (洗).\n*除* (除) means *to dispel* (遣).\n*玄览* (玄览) is *mind’s illumination* (心照).\n*Blemishes and flaws* (疵瑕) are *diseases* (病).\nOne must wash away dust and filth,\nDispel the five passions (五情),\nKeep inner and outer purity,\nIllumine all things with the mind—\nThen blemishes and flaws, like diseases,\nWill vanish without trace.\nThis teaches how to cultivate the heart (修心).」",

      "translated_text": "The Sage refers to the ruler who follows the Dao.\n\nThe ruler who follows the Dao allows his mind to wander beyond sound and color, while nurturing the boundless inner radiance. The belly—when it receives nourishment and fills with substance—does not chase after things, thus preserving its wholeness and attaining spiritual sovereignty. Therefore, the Sage follows this principle and prioritizes the belly.\n\nThe eyes—when they fixate on colors and cause disorder—lead one to chase after things, thus blinding the outer senses and dissipating vital essence. Therefore, the Sage warns against this and does not indulge the eyes.\n\nTo \"discard the former and take the latter\" means to abandon the eyes' pursuit of things and embrace the belly's inner completeness.\n\nIndulging in the pleasures of sound and color leads to slaughter and disgrace, while not valuing hard-to-obtain goods brings honor and prosperity. Thus, honor and disgrace follow.\n\nHonor and disgrace are like sudden alarms.\nHonor refers to wealth, nobility, celebrations, and rewards—all that is fortunate.\nDisgrace refers to poverty, humiliation, punishment, and misfortune—all that is calamitous.\n\nThose who grasp the Dao regard the body as a temporary lodging, and life and death as burdensome afflictions. They neither rejoice in prosperity nor fear adversity, knowing that official rank and external possessions are mere transient dependencies. How could honor and disgrace bind their hearts and cause constant alarm?\n\nThis speaks of honor and disgrace as sudden alarms—words meant for the average person.\nThe moderately wise, dwelling in safety yet mindful of peril, fearing disgrace even in honor, thus react as if alarmed.\nCommon folk flee toward trivial pursuits, alarmed by disgrace, while the moderately wise, observing the fundamental Dao, are alarmed by honor—hence, \"honor and disgrace are like sudden alarms.\"\n\nTo hold great afflictions as one’s own body.\n\"Great afflictions\" refers to official rank, treasures, and external possessions that sustain life.\nThe perfected one knows the body is not truly theirs, yet they still cling to externals—how much more so do they cling to what they revere?\n\nNow, people of the world claim that official rank and treasures can sustain life, thus valuing them as their own body, unaware that both the body and external things are the roots of great sighing and are unworthy of reverence.\n\nWhat is meant by \"honor and disgrace\"? Honor is superior; disgrace is inferior.\n*(Original note: The *Kaoyuan* text reads \"honor is inferior, disgrace is superior.\")*\nIt means that when one attains wealth and nobility, relying on honor leads to arrogance and ruin. If ruin comes from honor, then honor is the root of disgrace—thus, \"honor is inferior.\"\n*(Original note: The *Heshang Gong* and *Huangfu Mi* texts also read \"honor is superior, disgrace is inferior,\" meaning gain is superior, loss is inferior.)*\nTo gain is like being alarmed; to lose is like being alarmed—this is called \"honor and disgrace are like sudden alarms,\" concluding the meaning.\n\nThe vulgar cling to their wealth and rank—holding them brings trembling, losing them brings sorrow. They do not understand that gain and loss are not truly theirs, so they are all seized by alarm.\nThe moderately wise know that fortune and misfortune cycle like a knot. If one enjoys honor and prosperity, decay and disgrace will inevitably follow, so they guard against overreaching, fearing loss as they would alarm.\n\n*The Liezi* says: Zhao Xiangzi sent envoys to attack Di, capturing two cities yet wearing a worried expression. He said, \"I have great virtue and heavy deeds; how can I not be vigilant?\" Confucius heard this and said, \"The Zhao clan will surely flourish—this is gaining as if alarmed.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"to hold great afflictions as one’s own body\"? My greatest affliction is that I have a body. When I have no body, what affliction do I have?\n*(The repeated \"what is meant by\" marks a question-and-answer structure to introduce the following explanation.)*\nThe reason one has great affliction is that they have a body.\nThe human body, lacking fur or feathers to resist cold and heat, must rely on external things to nourish life and preserve existence. Yet those who cling excessively to life often court death, and thus great sighing follows.\nThis arises from being ensnared by worldly attachments, clinging to the idea of having a body.\n\nIf one transcends the body, no longer treating it as their own, forgetting the mind and no longer treating it as their own, merging with the natural transformations and aligning with all things—moving as if dragging dead wood, sitting as if gathering cold ashes—then the former afflictions of honor, disgrace, and great peril, what harm can they bring?\nThus it is said: *When I have no body, what affliction do I have?*\n\nIn *\"On Equality of All Things,\"* Zi Cha said to Yan Yan: \"Now I have lost myself—do you know this?\"\n*(Original note: \"Lost\" here means \"forgotten\" or \"transcended.\")*\nTo abandon illumination and attain seated forgetfulness is to still greater afflictions—how much more so for those who naturally merge with existence?\n*(Original note: Some interpret \"no body\" as annihilation or emptiness, but this misses the essence of Laozi’s teaching.)*\n\nThus, to hold the body as precious for the sake of the world is to be able to entrust the world to it.\nTo love the body as precious for the sake of the world is to be able to deposit the world in it.\nFrom the perspective of transcending the body upward, this broadly addresses how common people and scholars are seized by honor and disgrace, leading to great affliction.\nFrom the perspective of valuing and loving downward, it specifically speaks of rulers who have not yet forgotten the world, hence the language of entrustment.\n\nYet the idea of entrustment is not the virtue of the highest Sage. If one’s heart wanders in tranquility, blends with the boundless, follows nature without artifice, then one may restore the winds of antiquity.\nLu Xi-sheng said: If one’s heart is disturbed by gain and loss, clinging to external things, then honor and disgrace never bring lasting peace, and fortune and misfortune never cease. How can such a one govern the world or hold the great position within the realm?\n\nOnly those who hold the body as precious for the world’s sake, loving the body as precious for the world’s sake, truly value and love the world, not their own bodies.\nThus, gain and loss lie beyond them, and worries and afflictions do not cling to their person. Even so, they dare not claim dominion over the world—how much less would they seize it as their own?\n\nThis is the Way of Great Dao, the intent of the public realm.\n*(Original note: The *Kaoyuan* text reads: \"Thus, to hold the body as precious for the world is to be able to entrust the world; to love the body as precious for the world is to be able to deposit the world.\" The commentary says: This chapter begins with a warning against honor and disgrace, concluding with the idea of entrustment.

and disgrace, glory and calamity,\ndo not diminish or exchange the body,\nonly then can the world truly be entrusted.\n\n**Yī** (原本作 *jī*), in ancient texts, refers to the subtle and formless.\nThe *Yìjīng* says: \"Subtle (*jī*) is the faintest stir of movement.\"\nThough this meaning exists, it is now preserved but not discussed.\n\nThat which cannot be heard is called **\"Xī\"** (希).\nThat which cannot be grasped is called **\"Wēi\"** (微).\nThese three—**Yī**, **Xī**, and **Wēi**—\ncannot be summoned or invoked,\nso they are merged into one.\nThe Dao is difficult to describe and define,\nthus the Sage names it with reluctant necessity.\n\nThe Dao is not a visible thing,\nyet cannot be seen with the eyes—\nthus, within the formless,\nit manifests all forms,\nand is therefore called **Yī** (夷).\n**Yī** means \"level\"—\nit describes the boundless, tranquil state\nwhere, though present in form,\nthere is no form at all.\n\nThe Dao is not a sound,\nyet cannot be heard with the ears—\nthus, within the silent,\nit gives rise to all sounds,\nand is therefore named **Xī** (希).\n**Xī** means \"sparse\"—\nlike objects scattered thinly,\nwithout striking or touching,\nit is sound yet not sound.\n\nThe Dao is not a shape,\nyet cannot be grasped by the hands—\nthus, within the shapeless,\nit takes on all shapes,\nand is therefore called **Wēi** (微).\n**Wēi** means \"wondrous\"—\nit is subtle and profound,\nwithout substance or boundary,\nyet is shape without shape.\n\nOnly the **Perfect Sage** (至人) perceives with the spirit\nthe formless form of the Dao,\nand emerges beyond all forms.\nWith **qi** attuned, he hears the soundless sound,\nand emerges beyond all sounds.\nWith the mind discerning, he grasps the shapeless shape,\nand emerges beyond all shapes.\n\nThese three—**Xī**, **Yī**, and **Wēi**—\nare forced names for the Dao’s operation,\nnot its true, inherent existence,\nso they cannot be examined or questioned.\nThus, they should be merged and understood as the supreme unity.\n\nJun Ping says:\n*\"Before the great wild goose (*hóng*) is fully formed,\ncut open its egg and look inside—\nit is not yet the goose,\nyet its shape, sound, head, and tail\nare all already present.\nThis is the formless goose within the egg.\nHow much more so,\nwhen even the egg of the goose does not yet exist,\nand yet the Transforming Power (*zàohuà*) creates it!\"*\n\nFrom this, it is clear:\nThe origin of the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*),\nbefore Heaven and Earth,\nalready contains subtle traces of shape and sound,\nthough unseen and unheard.\nThus, it is evident:\n\nThose who do not see with the eyes can see,\nthose who do not hear with the ears can hear,\nthose who do not follow with the hands can grasp,\nthose who do not speak with words can explain.\nTherefore, the shapeless shape,\nfrom which Heaven and Earth arise,\nis called **Yī** (夷).\nThe soundless sound,\nfrom which the five tones begin,\nis called **Xī** (希).\nThe formless trace,\nfrom which myriad things emerge,\nis called **Wēi** (微).\n\nThese are the paths the ancient sages pointed toward.\nIf one forgets seeing and hearing,\ntruly follows and grasps,\nand merges all into boundless unity,\nthen the Dao is fully attained and exhausted—\nnothing more can be added.\n\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nits lower depths are not dark.\nEndless and unbroken, beyond naming,\nit returns to the formless.\n**Yī** (绳绳) means endless continuity,\nwithout bounds.\n\nThis is called the **indescribable state** (*wúzhuàng zhī zhuàng*),\nthe **formless image** (*wúwù zhī xiàng*),\nor **dim and vague** (惚怳).\n\nTo return to the formless is not to speak of emptiness—\nit means that within the stateless state,\nall forms are created,\nand within the imageless image,\nall things are transformed.\nTo say \"it exists\" would be wrong,\nyet things arise from it—\nthis is **having without having**.\nTo say \"it does not exist\" would also be wrong,\nyet things arise through it—\nthis is **having without having**.\nExistence and nonexistence are indeterminate—\nthis is called **dim and vague** (惚怳).\n**Hū** (惚) is \"nonexistence,\"\nyet speaks of nonexistence as if it were existence.\n**Huàng** (怳) is \"vague,\"\nyet speaks of existence as if it were nonexistence.\nThus, it is called **dim and vague**.\n\nApproach it, yet you cannot see its head.\nFollow it, yet you cannot see its tail.\nThe Dao precedes Heaven and Earth,\nand endures beyond the ancient past—\nhow did it come into being?\nNo one knows its origin,\nthus you cannot see its head.\nYet it persists through all ages,\nand extends beyond countless eons—\nhow does it end?\nNo one knows its conclusion,\nthus you cannot see its tail.\n\nThis is what prompts one\nto clear their **spiritual platform** (*língtái*)\nand model themselves after the Dao’s essence.\n\nTo hold the ancient Dao\nand govern the present is to know\nthe origin of antiquity—\nthis is called the

their wondrous origin.\nThis is not merely for humanity.\nTruly, when all things move together,\ntheir origin has never failed to begin in profound tranquility,\nemerging from formlessness,\nborn of harmonious qi,\nresponding to transformation.\nWhen observed in their return,\nthey exhaustively revert to the boundless void,\nreturning to the trackless,\nthus preserving their true form.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Return—does it not reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth?\"*\nThe heart of Heaven and Earth is profound stillness unto nothingness.\n\nJun Ping said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth return and invert,\nthus able to endure eternally.\nHumans return to sleep,\nthus able to attain clarity.\nFlying birds return to gather,\nthus able to soar high.\nRunning beasts return to rest,\nthus able to leap far.\nDragons and serpents return to their coils,\nthus able to shine resplendent.\nGrasses and trees return to their roots,\nthus able to remain verdant.\nWhen transformation

teeming and flourishing,\neach return to their root.\nReturning to the root is stillness;\nstillness is returning to the vital command;\nreturning to the vital command is constancy.\nTeeming—luxuriant in growth—\nrefers to plants and grasses.\nSome say *yún yún*—\nmoving and acting, teeming and numerous—\nrefers to flying and walking creatures.\nBy analogy, though movement and stillness differ,\nall return to their root.\nThe void is the boundless and formless;\nstillness is profound and silent.\nThe boundless and silent—\nthis is the root of movement and stillness.\n\nMoreover, the nonbeing is the origin of being,\nstillness is the sovereign of agitation—\nwhen movement reaches its peak,\nit must return to stillness;\nwhen being reaches its limit,\nit must return to nonbeing.\nThe roots of grasses and trees are heavy,\nresting low in stillness,\nthus they thrive.\nFlowers and leaves are light,\nresiding above in movement,\nthus they wither and fall.\nIf even things abide thus,\nhow much more so for humanity?\n\nTherefore, the Sage offers analogies\nto make the people abandon their love of desires,\nreturning to the root of emptiness and stillness,\nthus restoring the origin of their nature and vital command.\nThe origin of nature and vital command—\nthis is the boundless and obscure,\nwhere sight does not perceive and hearing does not hear.\nThis is only for the wise to awaken to themselves.\n\nThose who awaken to it\nwalk, stand, sit, and lie outside of emptiness and stillness,\nyet respond to change without deviation—\nthese are those who attain constancy\nand return to the vital command.\n\nTo know constancy is clarity.\nTo not know constancy is reckless action—disaster.\nThis speaks to the difficulty of the constant Dao,\nyet even understanding it is enlightenment.\n\nThose who awaken to the constant Dao\npossess spirit that transforms without bounds,\nnature that communicates with all,\nqi that harmonizes with all—\nthey do not know of all things as \"me,\"\nnor of \"me\" as all things,\nthus able to tread upon water and fire,\npierce metal and stone,\nreverse mountains and rivers,\nshift cities and towns,\nride the void

      "translated_text": "The sovereign—what power does he hold over me?\n\nZhuangzi said: In the age of supreme virtue, the worthy are not exalted, the capable are not employed. The ruler stands like a pole marking a branch, the people move like wild deer—upright and proper without knowing it as *righteousness*, loving one another without knowing it as *benevolence*. They act without leaving traces, perform deeds without leaving records. This is the age of the *Supreme Above*.\n\nThe next stage: they are cherished, they are praised. As supreme virtue declines and *benevolence* and *righteousness* become prominent, those who benefit from *benevolence* grow close and attach themselves, those who embrace *righteousness* praise and elevate them. Zhuangzi said: When the sage arrives, he bends and stretches to create *benevolence*, he stands on tiptoe to establish *righteousness*, and thus the world begins to doubt. Doubt gives rise to cherishing and praise.\n\nAgain he said: Shun had his natural conduct, and the people delighted in him, so he moved his capital three times to Chengdu. Yao, hearing of his virtue, raised him to high office and then abdicated in his favor—this is the stage of cherishing and praising.\n\nThe next stage: they are feared, they are scorned. When *benevolence* and *righteousness* fade and penal laws are established, when penal laws are strict, the people fear them. Though laws are strict, those who rely on cunning and deceit will transform the people, leading them to fraud and deception—this is when the people’s scorn of their ruler runs deepest.\n\n*The Profound and Mysterious* says: In the age of the *Supreme Above*, virtue spreads naturally—this is when the people merely know of their sovereign above. The next stage is to prevent them from doing wrong—this is the stage of cherishing and praising. The next stage is to reward the virtuous and punish the violent—this is the stage of fear and scorn.\n\nTrust is insufficient, so distrust arises. Sincerity is when the heart loves truly; faithfulness is when words can be relied upon. When trust is complete, the world is secure; when trust is lost, the world is in peril. Now that cunning and deceit have flourished and fraud is rampant, the ruler’s trust is lacking among the people, so distrust answers in kind.\n\nThe ruler’s influence over the people is like the reflection of a bright mirror—its form is clear, its logic unerring. Wang Bi said: When the body’s nature is lost, disease arises; when the essence of things is distorted, flaws and conflicts emerge. When trust is insufficient, distrust follows—this is the natural order.\n\nYet even this is better than reckless speech. From the stage of cherishing downward, the way of the *Supreme Above*’s effortless transformation is already lost, unable to restore the purity of antiquity. Even so, it still values speech and teaching, clinging to old methods as the means of transformation. Though far from the Dao, it is still better than reckless speech leading to distrust and rebellion.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled, the people say, *\"This is natural.\"* The ruler of the Dao governs with passive ease, so achievements are completed without claim, his silence and stillness profound—thus affairs are settled and forgotten. The people are pure and unadorned, doing nothing in vain, saying, *\"This is simply natural.\"* Where then do the hearts of cherishing, praising, fearing, and scorn arise?\n\nThe old saying: *\"Trust is insufficient, so distrust arises\"*—this explains *fearing* and *scorning*. *\"Yet even this is better\"*—this explains *cherishing* and *praising*. *\"When deeds are accomplished...\"*—this again echoes the stage where the people merely know of their sovereign above. To rigidly adhere to old interpretations is not followed here.\n\nThe *Supreme Above*’s effortless virtue is not manifest. When *benevolence* and cherishing arise, the *Great Dao* is abandoned, so it is ranked below. When the *Great Dao* is abandoned, *benevolence* and *righteousness* emerge. The *Great Dao* is the ancient way of effortless transformation. *\"Abandoned\"* means both hidden and decayed, no longer practiced. When the people’s hearts are not pure, the *Great Dao* is hidden and decayed; supreme virtue is not practiced.\n\nThen the seven forms of artificiality gradually arise, and *righteousness* and *profit* grow excessive. Thus, the pure is shaped into vessels—this is when the *Great Dao* is abandoned, giving rise to the seven forms of artificiality.\n\nZhuangzi said: Fish forget one another in the rivers and lakes; people forget one another in the states of Dao and Wei—this illustrates the age of the *Great Dao*. When *comprehensive love* becomes *benevolence* and *judging wrong* becomes *righteousness*, then *benevolence* and *righteousness* arise from insufficiency. This is like fish stranded on dry land, splashing each other with muddy water, moistening one another with saliva—not as good as forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes. This explains how the *Great Dao*’s abandonment gives rise to the seven forms of artificiality.\n\nWisdom emerges, and great deceit follows. When purity is lost and the *Great Dao* is abandoned, wisdom arises, and with it, great deceit—this is the natural order. Zhuangzi said: The true nature of the horse is to graze, drink, and lift its legs as it walks. When happy, it nuzzles and rubs necks; when angry, it rears and kicks. This is all the horse’s wisdom. But when the master of horses tames it—with bit and bridle before, whip and spur behind, the yoke and reins to guide it, and the monthly inspections to refine it—the horse becomes skittish, resistant, fierce, and deceitful, and the cunning of stolen reins is born.\n\nIn the age of antiquity, the people lived without knowing what to do, walked without knowing where to go. They dwelled in contentment and joy, drumming their bellies as they wandered. The people could do no more than this. But when the sage arrived, he bent and shaped *rites* and *music* to regulate the world’s form, he stretched and adjusted *benevolence* and *righteousness* to soothe the world’s heart—and thus the people’s cunning and deceit grew, their sophistry and hair-splitting flourished. This is what is meant by *\"wisdom emerges, and great deceit follows.\"*\n\nThe five relationships are disrupted, and *filial piety* and *affection* arise. The state falls into chaos, and loyal ministers emerge. The five relationships are father, son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife. The *Rites* say: When the *Great Dao* is practiced, one does not love only one’s own kin, nor cherish only one’s own children—true *benevolence* forgets kinship. Those who cherish their kin treat nephews as their own children and serve uncles as their own fathers. When the five relationships are harmonious, where then does *filial piety* and *affection* become prominent? Thus, the people’s reverence for my kin is as it should be for all kin. Therefore, above and below live in harmony, and the bonds of kinship are forgotten.\n\nBut when the teachings of balance are lost and the young harbor superiority, they defy the natural order, so the five relationships are disrupted, and the traces of *filial piety* and affection appear.",

      "translated_text": "「Loyal ministers,\n　　The six kinships—father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife—are thus unified. The *Rites* state: When the *Great Dao* is practiced, one does not favor only one’s own kin nor cherish only one’s own children; true *virtue* forgets kinship. Those who cherish their kin treat nephews as their own children and serve uncles as their own fathers. When the six kinships are harmonious, where then does *filial piety* and *affection* become manifest? Thus, all revere my kin as they should revere all kin. Therefore, above and below dwell in harmony, and the bonds of kinship are forgotten.\n\nBut when the young lack balance and harbor arrogance, they transgress the natural order, disrupting the six kinships, and the traces of *filial piety* and affection then appear.\n\nMoreover, the *Sage* maintains balance, and thus the Four Seas become one family. Wandering in spirit to the *Maoshan* (Maoshan Mountains), one fades away and forgets all of one’s worldly concerns. Then, the ruler above does nothing, yet the people transform effortlessly—where then would there be ministers who pierce their eyes and split their hearts to serve?\n\nThus, the blind and the late-born, the obstinate, are praised as *Shun* is called *Great Filial Piety*, the wise yet austere of *Lu* is praised as *Shen* is called *Able to Nurture*, the upright *Jie* of *Xia* saw *Longfeng* rise, and the perverse *Zhou* saw *Bigan* shine—these are acts of necessity, not of joy.\n\nWhen the *Dao* is abandoned, *virtue* and *righteousness* become prominent; when *wisdom* emerges, great deceit arises. To restore the ancient simplicity, one must extinguish the traces of *Sageliness* and discard cunning *wisdom*—thus comes the teaching of *Discarding Sageliness and Wisdom*.\n\nDiscarding Sageliness and Wisdom, the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\n*Sageliness* refers to the institutions, laws, symbols, and functional relics of the *Sages*.\nTo discard it is to restore their original simplicity.\n*River Upper Master* (Huangshang Gong) said: The Five Emperors’ painted symbols and *Cangjie*’s creation of writing are inferior to the Three Sovereigns’ simple knotted cords without script.\n\n*Wisdom* refers to strategic scheming, calculation, and the manipulative arts of *halong* (纵横).\nTo discard it is to return to *non-action*.\nThe *Classics* say: To rule a state with *wisdom*, it is the state’s ruin.\nIf one does not display the functional relics of *Sageliness* nor employ the manipulative arts of *wisdom*, then craftiness and deceit will not arise, calamities and chaos will not occur, and the people will be like innocent children, devoted solely to agriculture—then their benefit will far exceed a hundredfold.\n\n*Zhuangzi* said: “Abandon minor *wisdom*, and major *wisdom* will become clear.”\nHe also said: “If the *good man* is not found, the *Dao* of the *Sage* cannot stand.\nIf *Zhi* the robber is not thwarted, the *Dao* of the *Sage* cannot prevail.”\nThus, one must discard and abandon these things for the people to truly benefit.\n\nDiscarding *virtue* and *righteousness*, the people return to *filial piety* and *affection*.\n*Virtue* is the love of things, so people grow attached to it.\n*Righteousness* is the proper arrangement of things, so people praise it.\nYet the harm of *virtue* and *righteousness* lies in the attachment and praise they inspire—once attachment and praise are established, the hearts of the people become restless, and the harmony of life and nature is lost.\n\nWhen the harmony of life and nature is lost, how then can *filial piety* and *affection* persist?\nNow, if one discards and abandons them, it is to restore the wholeness of life and nature and revive *filial piety* and *affection*.\n\nDiscarding cleverness and material gain, thieves and robbers will cease to exist.\n*Cleverness* refers to intricate carving, fine craftsmanship, and mechanical devices like locks and keys.\n*Material gain* refers to precious gems, jade, and measuring tools—weights, scales, seals, and tokens.\nThough these mechanical devices and tokens may serve to guard against minor threats, in the grand scheme, they cannot repel great calamities.\nToday, to discard them is like casting aside jade, destroying pearls, burning seals, and breaking tokens—it is to make the people simple and unadorned, so that theft naturally stops.\nThese three teachings—*Discarding Sageliness and Wisdom*, *Discarding Virtue and Righteousness*, and *Discarding Cleverness and Material Gain*—are said to be insufficient as *culture* (文), so they are followed by *Associated Teachings*.\n*Associated* means to follow or continue.\nThe three teachings refer to the aforementioned steps.\nThough one may wish to abandon these three, to restore the ancient simplicity, yet as *culture* and *teachings* handed down, they remain unclear in principle—thus, many find them perplexing.\n\nSeparately, there are the *Associated Teachings* to follow, which will clarify the mind like ice—this is explained below.\n*Seeing Simplicity and Embracing Purity* (见素抱朴), with *few private interests and little desire*.\n*Seeing Simplicity* means preserving one’s natural purity, without mixing in artificial adornments—thus, the traces of *Sageliness* and *wisdom* naturally vanish.\n*Embracing Purity* means returning to one’s original simplicity, without indulging in ostentation—thus, the sentiments of *virtue* and *righteousness* naturally fade.\n*Few private interests* means adhering to one’s proper portion with utmost fairness, not coveting external beauty—thus, cleverness and artifices naturally cease.\n*Little desire* means moderating one’s emotions and living frugally, calm and tranquil—thus, superficial material gain naturally disappears.\n\nThe traces of *Sageliness* and *wisdom* can rescue the near but fail to know the harm they cause to the far; the sentiments of *virtue* and *righteousness* can aid the urgent but fail to recognize their deviation from true nature; the tools of *cleverness* and *material gain* can assist the small but fail to see their danger to the great. Therefore, the *Sage* is bright yet does not display, wise yet does not act, holding only to *Seeing Simplicity and Embracing Purity* as their aspiration, and *few private interests and little desire* as their concern. Thus, ruling a state in this manner, the people attain wealth and longevity, returning to the ancient simplicity, and cultivating oneself in this way, one’s body withers and mind grows empty, fading away like a lost pair.\n\nWhen the traces of *Sageliness* are discarded, cleverness and artifice naturally fade; when *virtue* and *righteousness* are discarded, *affection* and *filial piety* naturally flourish, and kinship grows harmonious. This arises from the harm caused by *scholarship*—thus, it is followed by the teaching of *Discarding Scholarship and Freedom from Worries*.\n\n*Discarding Scholarship and Freedom from Worries*.\nThe *Dao* is vast and difficult to speak of—how can *scholarship* grasp and advance it? Thus, it can be transmitted but not bestowed, obtained but not fully possessed.\nThe case of *Lun Bian* (轮扁) was not one of inability to transmit, but rather of lacking a recipient of suitable quality.\nHow much more so with the *Dao* of the *Sage*!\nToday’s *scholars* are but the dregs and refuse of knowledge.»",

Just as the *Wild Duck’s Way* (凫经) is brief, yet clinging to it brings worry, and the *Crane’s Way* (鹤经) is long, yet severing it brings sorrow. *Lun Bian* (轮扁) and *Shi Guang* (师旷) were born with natural brilliance, yet later scholars often distort the strengths and weaknesses of their innate nature—how could they ever emulate their humble yet proud virtue?\n\nAbandoning such emulation, one finds neither worry nor joy; instead, one follows their natural *qi*, attains the Sage’s heart, and thus what is truly sought is not lacking, while what is vainly discarded is not needed. Those who labor in scholarship yet remain troubled bow their heads and pierce their thighs, seeking only empty fame, or study by candlelight, pursuing only fleeting gain—thus, they are ensnared by honor and disgrace, joy and sorrow. How lost they are!\n\n*Yi* (唯) and *E* (阿) differ by how much? *Shan* (善) and *E* (恶) differ by how much?\n*Yi* (唯) is reverent acceptance; *E* (阿) is complacent assent.\nFrom the perspective of *social norms* (名教), *yi* is reverence while *e* is flattery.\nIn truth, *yi* and *e* both stem from the same voice—how distant their divergence!\n\nIf one forgets the world’s attachments, then the distinction between *yi* and *e* vanishes.\n*Shan* (善) is the praise of *auspiciousness* (吉); *E* (恶) is the label of *inauspiciousness* (凶).\nTo study and practice it is *shan* (善); to neglect study and defy it is *e* (凶).\nThe *Dao* is boundless, profound, and tranquil—how could it be confined to learning or not learning?\n\nThose who pursue *shan* (善) without attaining its essence find ruin in fame,\nwhile those who flee *e* (恶) without avoiding its roots meet destruction in punishment.\nThus, *shan* and *e* are not the true *Dao*—they are external things.\nSince both are external, how different can they be?\nOnly those who *Discard Scholarship* and *Free from Worries*, though they possess the Sage’s wisdom,\nremain unaware of it—how much more so with *shan* and *e*, *yi* and *e*!\n\nSome say: *\"Transform conventional scholarship into true scholarship,\nchange *e* into *yi*, change *e* into *shan*—it is as easy as turning one’s hand!\"*\nThe Sage’s words are of ultimate truth; these are the world’s teachings.\nIf one argues from this perspective, how does it differ from *yi* and *e*?\n\nThe ancients wrote: *\"The distinction between *shan* (善) and *e* (恶) is as follows:\nAs in the previous chapter, all know what is beautiful as beautiful—thus, *e* already vanishes.\nWhat people fear, they must fear.\nThe *Dao* is boundless—its depth is endless.\nThe Sage’s true heart and wondrous *Dao*,\n*Discarding Scholarship* and *Free from Worries*,\nthough they forget *shan* and *e* within their breast,\nmust align with *yi* and *e* in outward form.\nThe warnings of *shan* and *e* must not be disregarded—\nthis is the depth of the Sage’s *Dao*!\n\nThe petty-minded are not so.\nThey admire *shan* yet fail to practice it,\nfear *e* yet do not abandon it.\nThey drown in worldly scholarship,\ngoing forth without return,\nwasting their true nature,\nnever once halting in their folly.\n*Cent* (央) means *center* (中);

workings:\nwhen dispersed, the harmonizing *qi* is confined within the Great Void,\nwhen gathered, the pure essence is stored like grains in a granary.\nCirculating through the Six Empties,\nits applications are boundless—\nthus it is said, *\"never falters.\"*\n\nNo thing, great or small,\ndoes not rely upon the Dao.\nTo obtain it is to be whole,\nto depart from it is to perish.\nIt gives birth and completes all things—\nall depend upon it—\nthus it is called *\"the Mother of the world.\"*\n\nI know not its name,\nso I call it *Dao*.\nForced to name it, I say *Great*.\n\nThe Great Dao is formless,\nso no ear can hear it,\nno hand can grasp it.\nSince it lacks form, sound, or trace,\nits name is unknown.\n\nYet earlier it was said, *\"things blend into obscurity,\"*\nso it has *body* and *use*.\nOnce body and use are revealed,\nit gives rise to all things.\nExamining its use reveals its *virtue*,\nso it is named *Dao*.\nIt encompasses heaven and earth—\nits substance is supremely vast—\nthus, forced to name it, I say *Great*.\n\nGreat is called *Passing*,\nPassing is called *Distant*,\nDistant is called *Returning*.\nPassing—this is *going*.\nAll great things have boundaries,\nyet the Dao is boundless.\n\nWithout limit it goes,\nwithout shore it extends—\nthus Great is called *Passing*.\nThe farther it passes, the more distant it grows,\nits source cannot be traced—\nthus Passing is called *Distant*.\nThough distant beyond the Eight Wastes,\nit returns to stillness within the inch of the heart,\nlike a mirror’s clarity—\nresponding without storing—\nthus Distant is called *Returning*.\nReturning—this is *restoration*.\nTo go and return,\nto perish and revive,\nfrom yin to yang—\nall are the Dao’s transformations.\n\nThus the Dao is Great,\nheaven is Great,\nearth is Great,\nand the Sage-King is also Great.\nWithin the *domain*, there are Four Greats,\nand the Sage-King occupies one.\n\nThe Dao is the origin of heaven and earth,\nvast and boundless, encompassing all.\nAll things obtain it and live;\nthe people cherish it and honor it—\nthus the Dao is Great.\n\nHeaven is inverted above,\nmoving without rest,\ncovering all things endlessly—\nthus heaven is Great.\n\nEarth is congealed below,\nstill and unmoving,\nyielding and tranquil,\nthickly bearing all things endlessly—\nthus earth is Great.\n\nThe Sage-King is serene and does nothing,\nhis transformations reach all things,\nthe leader of the black-haired masses—\nhe does not dare compare himself to heaven, earth, or the Dao—\nthus he is also Great.\n\nThe Four Greats within the *domain* are:\nthe Dao, heaven, earth, and the Sage-King.\n*Domain*—this is *limit*.\n\nThe Dao encompasses the cosmos,\npenetrates the finest hair,\nsometimes transcends form,\nsometimes dwells within limits.\nFrom earth upward, all belong to heaven—\nnot the lofty, distant blue.\n\nHeaven is beyond earth,\nearth is within heaven.\nThe Sage-King, honored among humanity,\ndwells between the Nine Regions—\nall within the *domain*.\n\nThus the Four Greats within the *domain*.\nThe Sage-King follows the Dao of heaven and earth,\nholds the authority over all things,\nand among the Four Greats,\nhe shares in one.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"None are more divine than heaven,\nnone are more abundant than earth,\nnone are greater than the Emperor-King.\nThe Emperor-King’s virtue aligns with heaven and earth—\nhow could he be careless?\"*\n\nHumanity follows earth,\nearth follows heaven,\nheaven follows the Dao,\nthe Dao follows *naturalness*.\n\nThis admonishes the Sage-King:\nto model the Two Poles,\ntake the Dao as his standard,\nand the world will naturally be governed.\n\nThe Sage-King, guarding *yin*-like stillness,\nbears all without partiality—\nthis follows earth.\nYet he must not cling to earth’s immutability.\nWhen he moves with *yang*-like vigor,\nhis rule is impartial—\nthis follows heaven.\nYet he must not fixate on heaven’s unchanging course.\nInstead, he follows *wuwei*,\naligning with the Dao’s substance,\nletting all things return to their nature—\nthis is the Sage-King following heaven and earth as the Dao.\n\nIt is not that heaven, earth, and the Dao model each other,\nbut one should discern the profound intent of the Sage’s teachings—\nnot merely engaging in empty words.\n\nThe *mixed-and-formed* Dao—\nthis is called *strong naming*.\nStrongly naming the Four Greats,\nthe Sage-King occupies one.\nThe Sage-King, with heavy things governing light,\nthus places the heavy as the root of the light.\n\nHeavy is the root of light,\nstillness is the lord of agitation.\n\nGrasses and trees—\ntheir petals and leaves are light and fragile,\nperched on branches—\nthey wither under wind and frost.\nBut their roots are firm and heavy,\ndeep below—\nnothing can harm them, and they endure.\n\nLikewise, governing the body and the state,\none must take substance and weight as the foundation.\n\nDragons and serpents,\ncoiled and submerged in stillness,\ncan transform and ascend.\nTigers and leopards,\nmenacing and restless,\nare felled by arrows and die young.\nThus, for governing the body,\na tranquil heart brings harmony to all spirits—\nno cravings or agitation will harm it.\nFor governing the state,\na ruler who does nothing brings the people joy and ease—\nno scheming ministers will cause chaos.\n\nThus the noble person walks all day\nwithout leaving his *zhi* and *zhòng*.\n*Zhi*—a screen-car, also a heavy wagon.\n*Zhòng*—this is *weight* in his conduct.\n\nThe perfect person and noble never speak or act lightly.\nWhatever they do, they carry their *zhi* and *zhòng*.\nTheir words must weigh upon matters.\nIf their words and deeds are thus,\nhow much more the Dao—\nwould they dare for an instant depart from it?\n\nSome interpret *zhi* as *stillness*,\nalso warning of stillness and weight.\n\nMoreover, those who travel far\nnever abandon their *zhi* and heavy loads—\nfor their clothing and food depend upon them.\nIf they depart and discard them,\nthey risk exhaustion upon the road.\n\nLikewise, the noble person,\nif he abandons the Dao’s weight and stillness\nto act lightly and agitated—\nwhat greater calamity could there be?\n\nThough adorned with splendor,\nhe remains serene and detached.\n*Splendor*—the appearance of bustling adornment.\n*Serene*—this is *ease*.\nThe perfect person and noble,\never fearful in their hearts,\ndo not take ornate splendor as beauty.\nThey do not indulge in ease and comfort,\nbut remain detached and distant,\nabandoning arrogance and excess—\nthis too is the essence of guarding weight and stillness.\n\nSome texts read *honor-hall* or *feast-assembly*,\nmeaning they do not delight in halls of splendor,\nbut find ease in modest

he not guard weight and stillness,\nbut lightly abandon his body to reckless desires?\n\nIf a subject fails to be steadfast and weighty,\nhe loses his own foundation\nand forfeits his proper duties.\n\nThe ancient text reads:\n*\"Lightness leads to losing one’s foundation,\"*\nand if the ruler does not uphold the Way of non-action and serene stillness,\nbut stirs and disturbs the people,\nthen he loses his sovereign position\nand forfeits the harmony of Heaven.\n\nThe old saying goes:\n*\"If the ruler acts lightly and carelessly, troubling the people,*\n*then the people scatter—who would remain as his subjects?\"*\n\nIf subjects disguise themselves with deceit to seek wealth,\nact agitated to gain power and influence,\nthey invite exile and ruin,\nand cannot serve their ruler.\n\nBoth meanings are valid.\n\nThe method of guarding weight and stillness\nis only practiced well by the noble person,\nso it follows with *\"the noble person’s actions leave no

in observation or action,\nthis is obtained from the heart,\nso even without stepping outside the door,\nthere are no tracks or disturbances.\n\n*\"Noble speech\"* is like Zhuangzi’s cup-speech—\nwords drawn from the center,\never-renewing variations,\nin harmony with nature,\nwithout exceeding the proper boundaries.\nThus, there are no flaws or censures.\n\n*\"Noble calculation\"* means\nto guard the One and do nothing,\nto follow the natural course of all things,\nallowing their long and short,\nbroad and narrow,\ngreat and small,\nmany and few\nto each fulfill their proper measure,\nwithout harming their natural forms and capacities.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The One and speech become two,\ntwo and the One become three—*\n*from this point onward,*\n*even clever schemers cannot grasp it,*\n*how much less the ordinary?\"*\n\nThis is why the noble person\nrejects schemes and strategies.\nThe *Yin-Fu Jing* says:\n*\"The eight trigrams, the Heavenly Stems, the Earthly Branches—\ndivine schemes and occult concealments—\nthe interplay of yin and yang in victory and defeat,*\n*clearly advance into the realm of symbols.*\n*All this belongs to the study of contrived actions and clever stratagems.\"*\n\nThe perfect person wanders in the initial realm of things,\nallows all things to govern themselves without being enslaved by them,\nand calculates only his own body—\nthus knowing the other.\nHence, he has no need for schemes or strategies.\n\n*\"Noble closure\"* means the heart’s non-action.\nThe one whose heart does not act,\nthough sounds and colors may be before him,\nall such phenomena do not enter his ears or eyes—\nthis is why no doors or bolts are needed,\nyet nothing can open it.\n\n*\"Horizontal\"* is called *guān*,\n*\"vertical\"* is called *zhàng*.\n\n*\"Noble binding\"* means\nto bind affairs with the Dao.\nThe perfect person is simple and effortless,\nskilled at restraining greed and excess with the Dao,\nnaturally binding emotions and desires,\nwhile maintaining serene stillness without strain.\nThus, he has no need for explanation.\n\nTherefore, the sage is always good at saving people,\nso he does not abandon people,\nand always good at saving things,\nso he does not abandon things—\nthis is called *\"clinging to clarity.\"*\n\n*\"Clinging\"* means *secretly applying*.\nThe sage refers to those who practice the Five Noble Virtues.\n\nThe sage harmonizes with nature,\nhis heart merges with the utmost One,\nso he can treat all things—\neven the humble and lowly—\nas if they were sacred offerings,\nand assign the wise and foolish to their proper roles,\nallowing people’s nature to remain whole\nand their forms complete,\neach fulfilling their proper function—\nthus, he does not abandon people.\n\nFurthermore, he follows their growth and decline,\nrespects their capacities and endowments,\nensuring that square and round,\nstraight and crooked\ndo not harm Heaven’s principles.\nEven to the lowliest tiles and boards,\neveryone has their place—\nthus, he does not abandon things.\n\n*\"Always good\"* means\nto nurture the constant Dao\nwhile clearly discerning and following the natural course of things.\n\nThe *Hong Lie Jie* says:\n*\"In the past, when Gongsun Long was in Zhao,*\n*he told his disciples:*\n*'If a man has no ability,*\n*I cannot consort with

      "translated_text": "The thief then secretly untied the general of Qi’s tent at night and presented it to him. Zi Fa had someone return it, saying: *\"A soldier was gathering firewood and found the general’s canopy. I had him return it to the proper authorities.\"*\n\nThe next day, he went again and took the general’s hairpin. Zi Fa once more had it returned.\n\nWhen the Qi army heard of this, they were greatly alarmed. The general and his officers conferred: *\"If we do not leave today, the Chu army may take our heads.\"* Thus, they withdrew their forces.\n\nA skill may be slight, yet its use profound—it lies in how the ruler employs it. If one does not honor his teacher nor cherish his resources, though he may know the great confusion, this is called the supreme subtlety.\n\nThough the Sage may wander in the realm of self-realization, he cannot neglect his teacher and resources. Yet even when establishing them, he fears overvaluing his teacher or clinging to his resources, becoming mired in old traces and failing to reach the farthest heights. Hence, he repeatedly emphasizes: *\"Do not honor your teacher, do not cherish your resources.\"*\n\nThough a man relies on his teacher to awaken his initial understanding, he seeks the ultimate truth, which arises from his innate nature—this is the day of true transformation. Thus, the horse expert cannot transform a poor steed into a fine one, nor can a skilled artisan carve inferior wood into beams. Only when one forgets all aspiration can he attain the Dao’s ultimate.\n\nHence, Liezi, having learned from Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gao, later said: *\"I do not know whether my teacher and friend were truly my teacher and friend—this is the true forgetting of teacher and resource.\"*\n\nThough the Sage knows the petty man is rigid and his teachings may seem misleading, he still instructs the superior man, urging both to forget, and thus speaks of the supreme subtlety.\n\nGood deeds and good words are what save people and things. To be a teacher or resource is to know softness and hardness.\n\nThus, next comes knowing the雄 (*xiong*—masculine, strong, preeminent). Knowing the雄, guarding the雌 (*ci*—feminine, yielding, retreat), makes one the valley of the world.\n\nTo be the valley of the world is to preserve one’s virtue unchanging, returning to the infant.\n\nThe雄 is exalted strength, precedence. The雌 is humility, weakness, retreat. To know one’s own exaltation, to stand out before others—if indulged, it breeds arrogance and invites calamity. Instead, one must dwell in humility, guard softness and weakness, be modest and retreat, and the world will submit, as water flows into deep valleys. When one’s heart and mind are like a valley, one preserves virtue unchanging, abandons harsh desires, and returns to the innocence of infancy.\n\nInfancy is the pure, unadulterated harmony where distinctions of right and wrong are extinguished.\n\nKnowing the white, guarding the black, makes one the model of the world. To be the model of the world is to preserve virtue without excess, returning to the boundless.\n\nThe man of the Dao, whose heart and mind are like a valley, generates clarity in emptiness—bright and distinct—yet he guards his depth and silence, holding himself in obscurity, making his light shine without dazzling. This can be the model for the world.\n\nThose who take him as their model see his virtue without excess, aligning with the Dao’s true essence.\n\nKnowing honor, guarding humiliation, makes one the valley of the world. To be the valley of the world is to make virtue complete, returning to simplicity.\n\nThough the man of the Dao may be taken as a model, he must guard humiliation, hold victory in self-effacement, and let the world’s heart turn to him, as water flows into valleys. His capacity is like a valley—virtue is full yet nameless, returning to the Dao’s simplicity. Simplicity means concealing talent and hiding use.\n\nWhen simplicity disperses, it becomes an instrument. The Sage uses it as an official, thus the great order is not violated.\n\nReturning to the Dao’s simplicity means merging into the boundless, where vision and hearing find no grasp—this is the body’s attainment of true reality. Yet in governing, one must disperse and become an instrument.\n\nRiver Master said: *\"When the simplicity of all things disperses, it becomes an instrument. Used according to the Dao, it becomes divine clarity, flowing as the sun and moon, dividing into the Five Phases.\"*\n\nWhen a man’s true heart disperses, it becomes thought and deliberation. A single movement of thought brings forth myriad actions and all affairs. Affairs are coarse instruments.\n\nThe Sage takes their talents and abilities, appointing them as leaders of the hundred officials, thus able to govern all things naturally without harm.\n\nLu Xi Sheng said: *\"Ah, the great Dao! It abandons benevolence and righteousness. When simplicity disperses into instruments, the Sage uses them, thus able to lead the myriad coarse things. The great Dao is not an instrument, yet it uses these instruments. The great order is not violated, yet it governs all things. If one is not merged in the Dao yet seeks to use the world’s instruments, constrained by things and attempting to govern the world’s talents, I must see his ruin.\"*\n\nKnowing the雄, guarding the雌, practicing virtue like a valley yielding downward. Knowing the white, guarding the black, obscuring oneself as the world’s model.\n\nWhen the model is applied, one may wish to take the world. Yet to take the world by force—*I see it as inevitable failure.*\n\nThe Dao acts without action, naturally. Even the slightest matter follows it, let alone the world. If one does not follow its natural course but relies on boldness, seeking to forcibly take the world’s great instrument and indulge in artificial action, not only will he lose the Dao—I must see him perish.\n\n*\"Perish\"* means *\"die.\"*\n\nThe world’s divine instrument cannot be forced. To force it is to ruin it; to grasp it is to lose it. The divine instrument is the supreme position of heaven and earth, the divine clarity of the cosmos. Man is the divine thing of the world.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"I have heard of nurturing the world, not governing it.\"* *\"Nurturing\"* means fearing the world will corrupt its nature. *\"Governing\"* means fearing the world will stray from its virtue.",

      "translated_text": "The world does not corrupt its nature nor stray from its virtue—how then could there be one who governs it? This is called *not* governing the world.\n\nNot governing the world means following the natural course without action, letting things unfold spontaneously, so that the world is at peace and the divine things are tranquil.\n\nIf one does not follow the natural course without action but instead acts, it is like a clumsy woodcutter—though he applies his skill, he ruins more than he accomplishes. Thus, when the seven orifices were pierced, Pangu died; when the horse was whipped and urged, its strength was exhausted. Is this not the case where action brings ruin?\n\nAnd yet, if one clings stubbornly and refuses to yield, claiming to be a sage of governance, not only does one lose the ultimate truth, but one will also lose one’s own authenticity.\n\nThus, things may prosper or decline, be molded or shattered, be strong or weak, bear loads or collapse. These eight outcomes prove that external things cannot be relied upon.\n\nIn the world, some act with sincere intent, while others follow with insincere motives. Sincerity brings order, insincerity brings chaos. Order arises naturally, while chaos demands action.\n\nSome praise with warmth—those who extol and perfect the virtues of others—or criticize with coldness—those who slander and expose the faults of others. Praise with warmth signifies wealth and nobility, while cold criticism signifies poverty and lowliness, just as spring and summer nurture while autumn and winter wither. The affairs of the world change and transform in this way.\n\nSome see strength and support it, others see weakness and suppress it. Some bolster the weak to make them strong, others oppress the strong to make them weak—these are the inclinations of human nature.\n\nSome bear burdens and make them stable, others topple them and make them precarious. From this point onward, all are deviations from nature, relying solely on artificial action and boldness, seeking to take and thus bringing about these flaws.\n\nTherefore, the sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids extravagance. Excess, extravagance, and extravagance are all transgressions beyond measure.\n\nThus, the sage who governs the world knows that calamity and blessing depend on each other, that blessing and calamity lie latent. Abandoning artificial action, returning to desirelessness, discarding extreme contrivance and returning to nature, abandoning luxurious adornment and returning to simplicity, abandoning excessive desires and returning to tranquility—though excess, extravagance, and extravagance are three distinct names, they are all facets of the unity of *wuwei* and naturalness. Through these excesses and extravagances, artificial action arises, which is why the Old Master issued profound warnings.\n\nIf one insists on forcing, ruin is inevitable. If one coerces the weak and strong, tilts the balance, indulges in extravagance and excess, it is better to assist the ruler with the Dao than to persist in such folly.\n\nThus, the *True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*—*Hidden Chamber of Reverence*—Chapter Four concludes.\nThe *True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*—*Compilation of Subtleties*—Chapter Five begins.",

      "translated_text": "「Bìxū Zǐ Chén Jǐngyuán compiled: *The Dao Scripture*—*On Using the Dao to Assist the Ruler*—states, *\"Do not use military force to coerce the world; such actions tend to rebound.\"* Here, *以* means *to employ*.\n\nThe virtuous minister, employing the Dao of naturalness, assists the sage ruler by first clarifying the *Heavenly Mandate* while *Dao and Virtue* follow, then *Dao and Virtue* illuminated, *benevolence and righteousness* follow, and so on—*benevolence and righteousness* clarified, *allocation and defense* follow; *allocation and defense* clarified, *form and name* follow; *form and name* clarified, *fitness and responsibility* follow; *fitness and responsibility* clarified, *self-reflection and restraint* follow; *self-reflection and restraint* clarified, *discrimination of right and wrong* follows; *discrimination of right and wrong* clarified, *rewards and punishments* follow. This is the method of using the Dao to assist the sage ruler.\n\nThus, one who holds the *Great Principle* (*dàxiàng*) will govern the world without harming its peace and stability. Military force is a cruel instrument, and warfare is a perilous affair—how can one display military strength to the world? The signs of war lie in the heart: harboring resentment before conflict is war, hasty speech and stern expressions are war, arrogant words and reckless challenges are war, indulging in battles and assaults is war. These four are the seeds of great and petty strife alike.\n\nMoreover, when humans oppress things violently, things will inevitably retaliate—this is called *\"beasts driven to desperation will strike.\"* Hence, it is said, *\"such actions tend to rebound.\"*\n\nWhere troops are stationed, thorns and brambles grow; after great armies pass, calamitous years follow. Where soldiers dwell, they bring destruction: they plunder the people, obstruct agriculture, leaving fields barren and homes exposed, thorns and brambles to flourish wildly. Furthermore, once great armies have passed, slaughter knows no bounds, and the grievances of life and death disrupt the harmonious *qi*, causing *yin-yang* disturbances—surely floods and droughts will follow.\n\nFor one who governs his own body and seeks to resolve his troubles, military campaigns become burdensome like troops, vexations like thorns, cravings like great armies, and illness like calamitous years. Following righteousness with reckless abandon, one cannot fathom its depths.\n\nThus, the wise act decisively yet without arrogance, never daring to employ force for coercion. Act decisively yet do not boast, act decisively yet do not glory in victory, act decisively yet do not be proud. This is called *good use*.\n\nThe harm of military force is something even the enlightened abhor. Yet, even the sagest of rulers never abandon it entirely, for its origins are noble and profound. Gēngsāng Zǐ said: *\"The roots of war lie in humanity’s very beginning.\"* Again, he said: *\"There are those who die from taking medicine, yet one cannot forbid all physicians in the world. There are those who die from boarding ships, yet one cannot forbid all ships in the world. There are those who lose their nations through war, yet one cannot forbid all military forces in the world.\"*\n\nWar cannot be abolished, like water and fire. Good use brings fortune, poor use brings calamity. Hence, anger and corporal punishment must not be indulged in the home, legal punishments must not be indulged in the state, and military campaigns must not be indulged in the world.\n\nThe sage rulers of antiquity had *righteous wars* yet no *indulged wars*. Therefore, one who uses the Dao to assist the ruler must uphold *feminine tranquility*, never daring to coerce the world with military force. When forced to respond, they do so with restraint—this is called *good use*.\n\nDecisive (*guǒ*) means *courageous*. Speaking of the good use of troops, it means courage in resolving crises, not daring to employ weapons to coerce the world. Though there is courage in resolving crises and repelling enemies, it must all be done without coercion.\n\nThings grow strong only to decline—this is called *not the Dao*. *Not the Dao* is early decay. Though one may act decisively to resolve crises and repel enemies, it is all done without coercion. Only violence for the sake of violence is to be avoided; decisive action must be for righteousness alone, not for the love of war.\n\nThe growth of grass and trees is soft and tender; when they reach their peak, they wither and fall. Human infancy is marked by softness and weakness; when one reaches his prime, he grows old and frail. This illustrates that military might and strength lead only to ruin—once ruined, one cannot claim to follow the Dao.\n\nUnrighteous acts cannot be emulated, and actions contrary to the Dao are better stopped early. Hence, *righteous wars* prevail, *responsive wars* succeed, *wrathful wars* perish, and *arrogant wars* are destroyed.\n\nThe good use of military force lies in decisive yet restrained action—without boasting, without wrath, without greed, without arrogance—responding only when forced, with righteousness in repelling enemies and saving people, not relying on strength or craving battle.\n\nGoverning one’s body and resolving troubles means: *\"The withering of a man is due to his failure to follow the Dao; failing to follow the Dao means early death.\"*\n\nTo assist the ruler, one must rely on *Dao and Virtue*, not on fine soldiers and military force. Thus, it proceeds to discuss *fine soldiers*.\n\nFine soldiers are instruments of ill omen, and things often loathe them. Hence, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them. *佳* (*jiā*) means *to favor* or *to esteem*. To favor and esteem weapons and armor as objects of luxury is to esteem what is not good.\n\nWeapons and armor, which harm the form and spirit of men, are only enjoyed by the cruel and obstinate. Even ordinary things may be loathed, how much more so by those who follow the Dao?\n\nThe gentleman values the left when at home, but the right when in war. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is such that the left is *yang*—generative, soft, and weak—while the right is *yin*—punitive, hard, and strong.\n\nThus, in times of peace, the gentleman esteems those of virtue to dwell on his left, but in times of war, he esteems the courageous to stand on his right.\n\nWeapons are instruments of ill omen, not for the gentleman. This is a reiteration to emphasize the point—*the Scripture explaining itself*.\n\nSince weapons are instruments of killing, of hardness and strength, and their purpose is to harm, they are indeed instruments of ill omen.\n\nThe gentleman takes *wuwei* and naturalness as his heart, and *Dao and Virtue*, *benevolence and righteousness* as his practice. Military force is only for defense and preparedness, not an instrument the gentleman habitually employs.\n\nWhen forced to use it, he does so with calm restraint. Barbarians and savages, bandits and deceitful thieves—these are the reasons why the gentleman, who follows the Dao, may be forced to use military force. Yet he never initiates war, so he does not dare to be the aggressor but only the defender, nor to advance an inch when he must retreat a foot—all these are done without coercion.\n\nRighteous wars are used to conquer and settle chaos, to respond to enemies—never for the sake of seizing land or treasure.»",

      "translated_text": "Zhuangzi said: *\"When the market-seller Yi Liao of Shì Nán played with his ball and resolved the feud between the two families, and when Sun Shu Ao took his jade staff and feathered robe while the people of Ying cast down their weapons, this is what is called victory without battle—calm and tranquil is the highest. To resolve without disorder is called tranquil; to quiet the mind is called serene. When matters arise and one remains unmoved and unperturbed, this is the method for cultivating oneself.*\n\n*To win yet not take pleasure in it, but others do—this is one who delights in killing. He who delights in killing cannot achieve his will in the world. The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is *generation*; this is why all beings hold it in common esteem. Now, if one cannot win over others with virtue but instead raises armies, wages war, and seeks victory through slaughter, how can this be the conduct of one who follows the Dao?*\n\n*The *Lüzi* says: When Zhao Xiangzi sent his retainers to attack Zhi and won yet wore a worried expression, this was the conduct of a virtuous ruler holding victory—thus it is said, *‘to win yet not take pleasure in it.’* Yet if there are those who praise this, it is because they delight in killing. Those who delight in killing are not only shunned by others but will themselves be slain. These are the cruel and violent who love slaughter—such men must not be allowed to achieve their will in the world. If they do, they will surely defy Heaven’s virtue, unleash indiscriminate slaughter, and how could Heaven then aid them?\n\n*In auspicious rites, the left is honored; in funeral rites, the right is honored. The *Pianjiang* (Vanguard General) stands on the left, the *Shangjiang* (Commander-in-Chief) on the right—this is to treat them as in mourning rites. The left is *yang*, the principle of life, so in ordinary times the left is honored—this is auspicious. The right is *yin*, the principle of death, so in funeral rites the right is honored—this is inauspicious. The *Liji·Tan Gong* says: The Master stood with his disciples in a respectful bow, all facing right. The Master said: ‘Your eagerness to learn is admirable. As for me, I am mourning my sister.’ The disciples should then face left. The Commander-in-Chief, who has the power of life and death, stands on the right; the Vanguard General, who does not, stands on the left—this shows that the conduct of war follows the same principle as funeral rites. Now, if the Commander-in-Chief stands on the right, it is because he is treated as in mourning rites. When many are slain, one weeps in sorrow; when victorious, one is treated as in mourning rites. Truly, righteous war is waged only when there is no alternative. Victory brings many deaths, yet one does not take pleasure in it—thus one weeps in sorrow. The Commander-in-Chief stands on the right, for the right is the position of mourning—this is why.*\n\n*The military is an inauspicious instrument, to be used only when there is no alternative. The gentleman values it only as a secondary matter, placing *Dao* and its constant practice above all else. Thus it is said: *‘Dao is constant and nameless.’* Though crude and small, the uncarved block (*pu*) is not dared to be enslaved by the world. If lords and kings could guard it, all things would come of their own accord. The Dao, in its greatness, is not exhausted; in its smallness, it is not neglected. It encompasses all things, penetrating the minutest details. Empty within yet full without, it contains *yin* within *yang*—this is the Dao, not the Dao of names, nor the names of the Dao. Thus it is said: *‘Dao is constant and nameless.’*\n\n*Once nameless, it is not an instrument. Before instruments are manifest, it is called *pu*. The Dao is subtle and mysterious: unseen when viewed, unheard when listened to—this is called *small*. The world’s talents and tools have bright eyes to enslave sight, keen ears to enslave hearing, minds to enslave will, courage to enslave strength, eloquence to enslave speech, and skill to enslave action. All these named things are what the *wuwei* (non-acting) uses to govern. Only the nameless *pu* of the Dao cannot be enslaved by the world. If lords and kings could hold fast to the root of *wuwei*, vague yet present above, precious yet empty within, then external things could not burden their authenticity, desires could not deceive their spirit, and all things would come of their own accord. The four classes would have none who did not submit.*\n\n*When Heaven and Earth unite in *wuwei*, sweet dew descends. No one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed. Heaven’s *wuwei* causes *yin* qi to descend; Earth’s *wuwei* causes *yang* qi to rise. When both act in *wuwei*, harmonious qi and sweet dew descend, bringing auspicious omens—this is the way of lords and kings. Heaven and Earth’s virtue is harmonious and divine. The *Classic* says: *‘I act not, yet the people transform themselves; I do not praise, yet the people return to simplicity.’* This is to say that without command, things naturally follow and become balanced.*\n\n*At first, there was the Dao—nameless. Once named, one must know when to stop. Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril. The beginning was the Dao—nameless, the constant and nameless Dao. Named things are the instruments of all things. The Dao, at its beginning, was nameless, yet it could govern all named things—this is called *pu*. When dispersed, it becomes instruments; when the sage uses it, it becomes officials and rulers. Named instruments are all the possessions of the king. Once distinctions are established, ranks are set—none may transgress above or below. Thus one must know when to stop. To know when to stop is to know oneself—this is wisdom. To know oneself and others is enlightenment. How could there then be peril?*\n\n*The Master of Riverbank (Heshang Gong) wrote: *‘Heaven too will know it.’* This means that if one follows the Dao and practices virtue, Heaven too will recognize it. The analogy is that the Dao in the world is like streams and valleys to the rivers and seas. The Dao pervades the world without exclusion: above, it reaches the Celestial Capital and Purple Bureaus; below, it reaches the humble and lowly. To follow it brings prosperity; to defy it brings ruin. If lords and kings guard *wuwei* and tranquility, they will above attract harmonious qi and below win the people’s hearts. Root and branch will be in accord, and none will escape its blessings. This is like the flow of streams and valleys, which, when aligned with the rivers and seas, nourish all things, but when obstructed, become turbulent and turn to sand.*\n\n*To guard the Dao is to have all things submit of their own accord. To know oneself and others is wisdom.*",
      "overlap_context": " to use it, he does so with calm restraint. Barbarians and savages, bandits and deceitful thieves—these are the reasons why the gentleman, who follows the Dao, may be forced to use military force. Yet he never initiates war, so he does not dare to be the aggressor but only the defender, nor to advance an inch when he must retreat a foot—all these are done without coercion.\n\nRighteous wars are used to conquer and settle chaos, to respond to enemies—never for the sake of seizing land or treasure.»",

      "translated_text": "「To discern others is called wisdom, hence knowing speech is how one discerns others—this is the wisdom of adapting to people, yet not knowing oneself. To know oneself and hold fast in silence is called clarity, hence knowing without speaking is how one knows Heaven—this is the self-adaptation of clarity alone, which transcends wisdom.\n\nTo overcome others is to have strength; to overcome oneself is to be mighty. To overcome others is not the Dao of enduring victory. The Dao of enduring victory is called might. Might, though strong and forceful, when encountering one who surpasses it, will falter. But to overcome oneself is the Dao of constant victory. The Dao of constant victory is called yielding. Yielding can humble itself, and things will naturally defer to it—this is called not overcoming yet overcoming oneself, not assuming burdens yet bearing them. It is ever serene and never falters; what else could be called might?\n\nTo know contentment is to be wealthy; to persist in strong conduct is to have resolve. To know contentment means to curb one’s desires. When desire does not indulge in excess, frugality suffices, and this may be called wealth. To persist in strong conduct means to exert oneself diligently. Diligence in action will surely succeed, and this may be called having resolve.\n\nMaster Zhuangzi said: Master Zeng lived in Wei, his patched robe without lining, his face swollen and his voice hoarse, his hands and feet calloused. For three days he did not light a fire, and for ten years he did not make new clothes. His crown was upright but its ribbon frayed, his collar was grasped yet his elbows exposed, his shoes were worn but their heels stacked, and as he pulled his belt he sang the *Shang* hymns, his voice filling the heavens and earth, as if issuing from metal and stone. The Son of Heaven could not find a subject like him, nor any lord a friend. Thus, those who cultivate resolve forget form, those who cultivate form forget profit, and those who perfect the Dao forget the self.\n\nThis is what is meant by knowing contentment is to be wealthy, and persisting in strong conduct is to have resolve. To never lose one’s place is to endure; to die yet not perish is longevity. *Place* refers to Heaven’s bestowal of life and death, adversity and fortune, nobility and humility, poverty and wealth. To preserve its natural order and accept it as one’s fate, without letting gain or loss unsettle the heart—this is how one endures. Thus, when alive, one does not take life as joy, knowing its inevitable course; when facing death, one does not take death as sorrow, knowing its inevitable return. To follow one’s fate in uprightness and wait for its end, without harming life through self-destruction—this is called longevity.\n\nMaster Yan Junping said: Not knowing others means one cannot navigate affairs; not navigating affairs means one cannot engage with the world. Not knowing oneself means one cannot know Heaven; not knowing Heaven means one cannot foresee what has not yet come to pass. Not overcoming others means one cannot stand above; not standing above means one cannot rule. Not overcoming oneself means one cannot attain self-mastery; not attaining self-mastery means one cannot win others. Not knowing contentment means one cannot grasp wealth; not grasping wealth means one cannot curb desire. Not persisting in strong conduct means one cannot align with the Dao; not aligning with the Dao means one cannot find harmony. Without harmony, one cannot endure in life; not enduring in life means one cannot nurture the spirit. When the spirit is not cultivated, one cannot attain longevity.\n\nTherefore, to establish oneself in the world and benefit others while removing harm, to interact with people and adapt to change—nothing is broader than knowledge. To gather one’s intelligence and cultivate clarity, to found a state and govern its people, to realize the intent of the Dao and the mind of Heaven—nothing is greater than self-knowledge. To wield authority and govern the people, to establish laws and rites, to set forth transformations and issue commands, to rectify the ministers of the land and the lords of the states—nothing is more noble than overcoming others. To uphold virtue and morality, to align with the divine and luminous, to receive from Heaven and Earth, to harmonize yin and yang, to act or rest with measured advance and retreat—nothing is more exalted than overcoming oneself.\n\nTo govern one’s household and preserve the state, to bring the people ease and joy, to dwell in harmony with reverence and caution, to practice kindness and filial piety while fearing the law—nothing is higher than knowing contentment. To wander freely in the divine and luminous, to be tranquil and at peace, to be honored and adorned—nothing is better than finding harmony.\n\nTo serve in office and fulfill duties, to attend to superiors and oversee inferiors, to complete others’ undertakings and continue their legacies, to extend these to all the people—nothing surpasses what is enduring. What Heaven and Earth value, what all creatures depend upon, to dwell in without ever tiring, to rejoice in without ever ceasing, where all blessings flourish and none can rival its splendor—this is called longevity.\n\nMaster Lu Xisheng said: Knowledge that comes from without is called wisdom, like the external radiance of the sun and fire. Knowledge that returns within is called clarity, like the internal reflection of gold and water. To use yielding strength to overcome others’ violence is the force of the Daoist Way; to uphold yielding to overcome one’s own restlessness is the might of virtue. To know contentment in matters of profit and desire is to not lose one’s great undertaking, hence it is called wealth and might.\n\nTo practice benevolence and righteousness is to reach eminent virtue, hence it is called having resolve. To act without ever losing one’s place is to endure; to die yet the Dao not perish—this is called longevity. To know others is to overcome others; to know oneself is to know Heaven. To never lose one’s place and to die yet not perish, drifting freely without attachment, attaining the Dao—this is why it is followed by the great hymn: *\"The great Dao drifts, drifting, its left and right unbound.\"* The great Dao drifts, drifting—without clinging or attachment. The Dao is supremely high without equal, supremely deep without bottom. It is level as a carpenter’s plumb and straight as a mason’s line, round as a compass and square as a ruler. It encompasses the universe without exterior, and penetrates all things without limit. It drifts, drifts, filling the boundless expanse, yet without clinging or attachment—this is the very body of the Dao. Whether it manifests on the left or the right, all things meet their source, and none escape its reach—this is the very use of the Dao. All things rely upon it for life yet it does not decline; its work is done yet it claims no credit. To rely means to depend. Heaven depends on the Dao’s yang-qi to move and turn above, Earth depends on the Dao’s yin-qi to rest and settle below. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they still depend on the Dao for its function. How much more so the myriad things, which all arise from it! Moreover, the great Dao is without sentiment, giving birth to Heaven and Earth; how could it ever refuse to labor for the myriad things? Yet again, the great Dao is without form, shaping the world without material; though all things have names of reliance and dependence, when tracing their origins...」",

      "translated_text": "「Lofty and singularly transformative, the Dao gives rise to things as they change and yet remains self-generated—thus leaving no trace of reliance or repayment. The Sage’s accomplishments are complete yet he does not claim them as his own; this is the very use of the Dao/Way.\n\nHe nurtures the myriad things yet does not lord over them, ever without desire, and thus may be called *virtue/power* in its small aspect. The Dao can cover and nourish all beings, yet it does not expect their gratitude in return. Hence, the Sage cultivates benevolence and love to sustain all classes of beings, allowing each to fulfill its nature and grow without restraint. The *Sutra/Scripture* says: *\"Ever without desire, one beholds its subtlety; subtlety allows entry into all things, and thus one may name the Dao’s simplicity as small.\"* One variant reads: *\"The Dao clothes and covers all things\"*—here, *clothes and covers* means *cover and nourish*.\n\nWhen all things return to it yet it does not claim lordship, this may be called *virtue/power* in its great aspect. The Dao covers and sustains all things, encompassing them without exclusion; all things return to it yet it remains undifferentiated, undifferentiated yet not claiming lordship. Zhuangzi says: *\"Undifferentiated yet encompassing all things—this is what is called great. Greatness contains all things, and thus the Dao may be called great.\"* Therefore, the Sage never claims to be great, and thus he achieves true greatness. The Sage holds to the Dao, humbly calling himself *孤 (Gū, solitary)*, *寡 (guǎ, few)*, and *不谷 (bùgǔ, not plentiful)*, demonstrating his refusal to claim greatness.\n\nAll nations return to him, yet his joy in promoting them never wanes—this is how he achieves true greatness. Du Guangting says: *\"The Sage loves the people and relieves the suffering of all things, extending his virtue to great and small alike—this may be called small virtue/power.\"* Yet, he allows all things to follow their nature and attributes his achievements to Heaven—this may also be called great virtue/power.\n\nThe Dao/Way applies its transformations, dispenses its virtue to humanity, and stirs the pure and harmonious winds, while clothing the world with its clear and tranquil governance. Forgetting his own deeds, not exalting himself above others, his grand achievements may be called great, and his virtue may endure forever—because he does not claim greatness, he attains this very eminence.\n\nThose who cultivate their personal conduct are expansive and unconfined, like clouds without form or water without vessel. They may turn left or right, adapt to every shape and direction, yet remain unconstrained by fixed norms. When things come, they respond; when they reflect, they broaden. They do not boast of their responsive and expansive nature, though their benefits to all things are manifold. Benevolence extends even to the lowliest creatures, yet he never makes it his own. All good deeds converge in harmony, yet he does not claim them as his own.\n\nThus, he manifests the virtue/power that is neither small nor great, bearing no name of self-exaltation or self-denigration, and may be said to align with the complete and true Dao.\n\nThe great Dao is vast and boundless, yet left or right, all things meet its source. When all things return to it, this is because he holds to the great principle and its manifestations—thus, it follows with the next step: holding to the great manifestations.\n\nWhen he holds to the great manifestations, all under Heaven proceed, yet they do so without harm, in peace and stability. The great manifestations are the great principles. The eight trigrams and nine categories are what is meant here.\n\nThe rulers of the *太古 (Tàigǔ, Great Antiquity)* governed with no action, relying solely on the virtue/power of Heaven. When the Sage established the trigrams and observed the manifestations, the distinctions of auspicious and inauspicious became clear, and transformations arose—thus there came to be gains and losses, advances and retreats.\n\nWhen the vast and primordial transformations first emerged, the governance of the great principles began to shape the world, and the world’s original purity and simplicity departed. *往 (wǎng, to proceed/leave)* here means *to depart/abandon*.\n\nOnce the original purity and simplicity have departed, the great principle may still be upheld—thus, to proceed does not bring harm. To proceed without harm is because he acts according to the times, establishes achievements based on resources, assigns roles according to ability, and does not damage their inherent nature—thus all under Heaven are at peace and stable.\n\nYan Junping says: *\"The Dao has no form, so Heaven and Earth rely on it to give birth. The Dao has no possession, so yin and yang rely on it to begin. The Dao has no fixed principle, so the four seasons rely on it for their work. The Dao has no manifestation, so all classes of beings rely on it to proceed.\"* Thus, the great principle has no principle, the great manifestation has no manifestation; greatness is without limit, yet it is not without possession. It gives birth where there is no birth, and denies where there is no denial—so the Dao achieves without action, and Heaven and Earth are thus formed; virtue/power is realized without labor, and all things find their place. What more need be done?\n\nNot without limit yet not without possession, not acting yet not denying—here the Dao finds its own way, and all things find their own way. This is what is called the virtue/power of Heaven.\n\nIf the Dao waits for transformations to occur through deliberate action before they manifest, then what it achieves will be few. If virtue/power waits for labor to arise before it applies its function, then what all things receive will be sparse. This is what is meant by gains and losses, advances and retreats—thus the following passage states:\n\n*\"Music and baits: passing guests will stop.\"* This is an illustrative metaphor.\n\nWhen music’s harmony is played, people must linger briefly. When the *鐸饵 (duò’ěr, ritual bells and lures)* are beautiful, guests must pause.\n\nWhen music is exhausted, the ears are filled yet pass onward. When the baits are overindulged, the tongue grows weary and recoils. When guests stop, the host grows weary and takes offense.\n\nWhen the law first arises, the people hold it dear and praise it. But when its flaws appear, they fear it and scorn it. Zhuangzi says: *\"Benevolence and righteousness are the ancestral halls of the former kings, where one may stay but one night, yet not dwell long-term. To observe and then criticize excessively—this is the proper use of law.\"* If it lingers in the world and grows corrupt, becoming stagnant and enduring, then reason must fail.\n\nOnce reason has failed, how could proceeding not bring harm?",
      "overlap_context": "h depends on the Dao’s yin-qi to rest and settle below. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they still depend on the Dao for its function. How much more so the myriad things, which all arise from it! Moreover, the great Dao is without sentiment, giving birth to Heaven and Earth; how could it ever refuse to labor for the myriad things? Yet again, the great Dao is without form, shaping the world without material; though all things have names of reliance and dependence, when tracing their origins...」",

      "translated_text": "「Once having suffered its harm, then how could one speak of its peace and tranquility?\n\nThe Dao/Way, when uttered, is bland and without flavor.\n\nWhen music is exhausted and the baits are overindulged, the ears and tongue grow weary and recoil in excess. When the great law shows its flaws, fear and scorn become manifest.\n\nYet the Dao/Way, when spoken of, is bland and without taste—this is what is meant by *\"truthful words are not beautiful.\"* In stillness and simplicity, without contrivance, the people delight in their nature, thus they content with full bellies and dwell in ease, lost in the boundless and indistinct, unaware of their whereabouts.\n\nCould there ever be harmonious melodies or sweet flavors to be savored and chewed upon?\n\nThe Dao/Way is unseen when looked upon, unheard when listened to, and cannot be exhausted when applied.\n\nFor laws are shaped by contrivance, and those who cling to them will find their limits.\n\nThe Dao/Way is natural and without contrivance, yet neither sounds nor colors can fathom its depths.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Unseen when looked upon, unheard when listened to—from ancient times to today, its name never fades.\"* The common folk use it daily without knowing its true nature, yet it cannot be exhausted when applied.\n\nThe *象 (xiàng, form/manifestation)* without form means there is nothing to grasp. Without grasping, its application cannot be exhausted. But if one grasps it and claims possession, how could one avoid the extremes of excess and deficiency? Hence, it is followed by the principle: *\"When about to exhaust, first fully extend. When about to weaken, first fully strengthen. When about to abandon, first fully establish. When about to take away, first fully bestow.\"*\n\nThis is called *微明 (wēimíng, subtle clarity)*.\n\nMany learned interpreters of this chapter have offered varied explanations, yet none align with its proper structure. Some cite Confucius: *\"One may follow the Way with them, but not yet establish it; one may establish it with them, but not yet wield it with subtlety.\"* Others draw parallels with statecraft and strategic maneuvering, akin to the *纵横 (zōnghéng, sophistry/scheming)* school—equally unreliable. This is truly in harmony with the *阴符 (Yīnfú, Yinfu)*’s celestial mechanics, a secret employed by those of lofty insight and adaptable understanding.\n\nLu Xisheng said: *\"The profound dwelling of the Sage is nothing more exquisite than the interplay of *权实 (quánshí, expedient and truth)*. Truth is rooted in conformity with the natural order, while expedient arises from reversing established principles. Expedient aids truth, and truth enables expedient—though they differ in application, their essence converges in unity.\"*\n\nAfter Laozi first guided people with truth, establishing the teaching of *知常 (zhīcháng, knowing the constant)*, he further employed expedient to address practical matters, clarifying the necessity of reversal. This is what the *易 (Yì, I Ching)* speaks of: *\"Bending to complete all things without loss, encompassing heaven and earth without overreaching.\"*\n\nThe *Honglie Jie* says: *\"Qi Huan of Qi loved delicacies, and Yi Ya cooked his own son as bait to please him. The Lord of Yu loved treasures, and Duke Xian of Jin used a jade and a horse to lure him. The Hu King loved music, and Duke Mu of Qin used female dancers to entice him. These were all instances where people were ensnared by their own desires.\"*\n\nYan Junping said: *\"The Dao/Way traverses the moral realm, the divine illuminates it, heaven and earth transform through it, and yin and yang regulate it. Truth reverses into emptiness, clarity into obscurity, abundance into decline, tension into relaxation, possession into loss, life into death—these are the inherent natures of things and the natural principles of the Dao/Way.\n\nThus, the advantages of reversal and the benefits of yielding and extending: the Dao/Way governs heaven, heaven governs the sovereign, the sovereign governs his ministers, and the ministers govern the people. All living beings rely on this to sustain themselves.\n\nWhen tigers and leopards prepare to pounce, they first conceal their claws. When wolves and jackals are about to devour, their teeth are not seen. The Sage abandons his personal intentions to conform with the Dao/Way, the wise adapt to the world to serve the people. Loyal words, though harsh, preserve the truth; treacherous ministers, when rising, must be appeased by their lord. Knowing this and applying it, all within the six directions shall prosper.\n\nIgnoring this and applying it, even within the household, kin become bandits.\n\nThus, sons and brothers may become wolves and jackals when given advantage, while enemies and rivals may act as fathers and elders when denied. Yet within advantage lies disadvantage, and within disadvantage lies advantage—one may vanish while the other persists. Hence, even those who are not loyal cannot be trusted if they are close, and even those who are not virtuous cannot be loved if they are near. This is the lament of the worthy and the vigilant concern of the Sage and the wise.\n\nZhuangzi praised Xu Wugui’s audience with Duke Wu of Wei, where he first discussed horses and dogs before tiring the lord’s spirit and form, ultimately binding him with political counsel—this was the expedient of the wise, wielding extension and exhaustion.\n\nIf one applies this principle and extends it, then the meaning of *微明 (subtle clarity)* becomes evident.\n\nSoftness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength—this is the logic of the Dao/Way. Examining this reveals the application of *权变 (quánbiàn, expedient adaptation)*.\n\nFish cannot be pulled from the depths without harm, nor can the state’s instruments of utility be displayed to the people.\n\nThe state’s *权谋 (quánmóu, expedient strategies)* are great instruments for benefiting the world. If fish are wrenched from their natural pools and streams, even ants may torment them. If the state’s expedient strategies are leaked to the lower ranks, petty officials will exploit them—what of the cunning tyrants?\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* says: *\"Heaven has five hidden calamities; those who perceive them thrive. How could they be recklessly revealed?\"*\n\nAnother interpretation: *\"Fish pulled from the depths cannot be retrieved, and expedient lost to ministers cannot be reclaimed.\"*\n\nHan Fei said: *\"The sovereign’s power is like the depths—his ministers are fish within it. The ancients spoke in parables because of this.\n\nRewards and punishments are instruments of utility. The sovereign wields them to control his ministers, while the ministers seize them to dominate the sovereign. Hence, if the sovereign first reveals what he will reward, the ministers will scheme to earn his favor, claiming it as his virtue. If he first reveals what he will punish, the ministers will band together to shield themselves, calling it the strength of his rule. The state’s instruments of utility—should they not be handled with care?\"*\n\nThe *Honglie Jie* says: *\"In ancient times, Sici Zhihan served the state of Song. He told the Song ruler: 'The stability or peril of the state, the order or chaos of the people, rests on your administration of rewards and punishments.\n\nWhen you grant titles and favors, the people rejoice. When you mete out executions and punishments, the people resent them. Let me, your subject, bear the resentment, while you enjoy the favor.'\n\nThe Song ruler said: 'Good.' When I receive the praise, you shall bear the blame. I know well that I shall not be laughed at by the other lords.\"*」",

actions do not oppose all things—\nThus they act *without action* yet *without not-action*.\n\nThe *lower virtue/power* acts,\nYet does nothing—\nThe *lower virtue/power* descends from the *highest virtue/power*,\nNaturally receiving the plain and ordinary,\nObtaining the pure harmony of *original qi*,\nHis spirit aligns with yin and yang,\nHis clarity mirrors the sun and moon,\nThe people all revere and joyfully extol him—\nThus it is said to do nothing.\n\nThe ancient text reads: *The lower virtue/power acts yet does nothing.*\nIt speaks of those with *lower virtue/power*—\nTheir minds imitate emptiness,\nThey cling to the void,\nResponding to things with caution,\nDaring not to act hastily—\nThus it is said to do nothing.\n\n*Highest benevolence (shàngrén)* acts,\nYet does nothing—\nThe benevolent universally bestow and love all—\nAll things are possible.\nPossible yet without partiality—\nThus it is called *highest benevolence*.\nWith a mind to benefit all beings—\nThus it is said to act.\nMerit accomplished yet not claimed,\nAffairs completed yet not controlled—\nThus it is said to do nothing.\n\n*Highest righteousness (shàngyì)* acts,\nYet does something—\nRighteousness is what is fitting.\nWhat is fitting must entail some loss,\nYet in all matters, nothing is unfitting—\nThus it is called *highest righteousness*.\nThere is fitting and benefit—\nThus it acts.\nWhat it does involves cutting and severing—\nThus it is said to do something.\n\n*Highest ritual (shànglǐ)* acts,\nYet none respond—\nThen it rolls up its sleeves and drags them along.\n*Rolling up its sleeves*—\nExposing the arms by pushing aside sleeves.\n*Drags*—draws.\nRitual is *treading*—\nTreading the *Dao* and walking,\nDistinguishing high and low,\nFixing noble and base,\nWith humility, respect, harmony, and gentleness—\nThis is the root of ritual—\nThus it is called *highest*.\nJade and silk exchanged,\n威仪相答 (威严的仪节相互应答),\nBowing, kneeling, clenching fists,\nAdvancing, retreating, glancing and bowing—\nThis is the ornament of ritual—\nThus it is called *lower*.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*The greatest ritual aligns with heaven and earth in rhythm.*\nAgain:\n*Those who use ritual as wings—*\nThis is how they move through the world.\n\nThe ancient sages established ritual\nTo settle the mind and *qi*,\nTo refine appearance—\nThus it is said to act.\nYet the mediocre and lowly\nAbandon the root and exalt the branches,\nTwisting explanations and multiplying complexities,\nUnable to respond—\nThus it is said none respond.\nThis is the slight failing of ritual.\nBut there are those who flush with anger,\nBrandishing arms,\nDragging fingers to point out right and wrong,\nCompeting—\nThis is the extreme failing of ritual.\n\nThe Master Lao enumerates the undifferentiated and scattered,\nArriving at this in the lower text.\n\nYán Jūnping said:\n*Empty and without action, guiding all things—*\nThis is called the *Daoist*.\n*Clear and tranquil, responding without fail—*\nThis is called the *virtuous*.\n*Compassionately loving all things, endlessly bestowing—*\nThis is called the *benevolent*.\n*Rectifying names, aligning reality, acting appropriately—*\nThis is called the *righteous*.\n*Humble, retiring, courteous, guarding harmony—*\nThis is called the *ritualist*.\n\nThese five are all traces of the *Dao’s* exposition,\nNot the *ultimate ultimate*.\n\nThe *ultimate ultimate* transcends all distinctions—\nHow could there be these five?\n\nThus, losing the *Dao* leads to *virtue/power*,\nLosing *virtue/power* leads to *benevolence*,\nLosing *benevolence* leads to *righteousness*,\nLosing *righteousness* leads to *ritual*.\n*Dao, virtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, ritual*—\nThese five are the *Dao’s* essence,\nUnattainable through inquiry—\nThus they are merged into one.\nOnce divided, the five distinctions appear,\nAnd their traces become manifest—\nThus they are applied according to the age.\n\nThe *Dao* is the essence of *virtue/power*,\n*Virtue/power* is the function of the *Dao*.\nSeparating essence for function—\nThus losing the *Dao* leads to *virtue/power*.\n*Virtue/power* is *obtaining (dé)*.\nWhen things obtain life, this is called *virtue/power*—\nWhere there is life, there must be love—\nThus losing *virtue/power* leads to *benevolence*.\n*Benevolence* is *kinship (qīn)*.\nLoving things appropriately—\nThus losing *benevolence* leads to *righteousness*.\n*Righteousness* is *what is fitting (yí)*.\nWhat is fitting demands humility and respect—\nThus losing *righteousness* leads to *ritual*.\n*Ritual* is *treading (lǚ)*—\nTreading the *Dao* to form its patterns—\nSimple and direct, it is easy to follow;\nComplex

chaos.\nDeceit and pretense arise from it,\nAnger and contention take root—\nThis is what is called *superficial* teaching.\n\nFor *ritual* is the thinning of loyalty and faith,\nAnd the origin of chaos.\nIf one abandons *virtue/power*, *moral cultivation*, *benevolence*, and *righteousness*,\nAnd relies solely on *ritual* and teaching—\nIs this not the thinning of loyalty and faith,\nAnd the origin of chaos?\n\nBut if one reveres *virtue/power* and the seven *righteous acts*,\nAnd harmonizes them with *ritual* and teaching—\nThen *ritual* is elevated above them,\nAnd where would there be

diminished,\nWhile *ritual* is where pretense thrives—\nThis aligns with the origin of chaos.\n\n*Foresight* is the ornament of the *Dao*,\nAnd the beginning of folly.\nTo cultivate and exalt *ritual* and teaching is wisdom—\nWisdom is foresight,\nThus it is called *foresight*.\nOnce foresight precedes things,\nHow can one remain detached?\nThus governing with wisdom is a state’s ruin—\nIs this not the ornament of the *Dao*\nAnd the beginning of folly?\n\nBut if one conceals foresight and wisdom,\nThinking and deliberating nothing,\nThen one returns to simplicity and purity.\n\nExcessive *ritual* leads to chaos,\nExcessive wisdom leads to deceit—\nThis is an inevitable truth.\n\nThus, the true person dwells in substance, not ornament,\nIn reality, not superficiality—\nHence, they

pretense, or deceit?\n\nTherefore, they discard the shallow ends of *ritual* and *righteousness*,\nAnd take the great foundation of *virtue/power* and *moral cultivation*.\n\nThe ancient text

*virtue/power*.\nThough upper and lower differ,\nEach attains its unity—\nHence, it follows with the *One* of antiquity.\n\nThe *One* of antiquity:\nHeaven, obtaining *One*, is clear;\nEarth, obtaining *One*, is tranquil;\nThe *Spirit*, obtaining *One*, is numinous;\nThe *Valley*, obtaining *One*, is full;\nAll things, obtaining *One*, are born;\nThe sovereign, obtaining *One*, corrects

ancestor of Great Harmony,\nThe progenitor of Heaven and Earth.\nCondensed, it forms living beings;\nDispersed, it radiates as light.\nIn the yin, it shares the yin’s *virtue/power*;\nIn the yang, it rides the yang’s waves.\nIt dwells in the Celestial Capital yet remains untainted,\nIt resides in the humble hut yet remains unsoiled.\nIts position is unchanging above and below,\nIts essence is

*True Sovereign*;\nGuiding the form, it is the *True Ruler*.\nWhen coiled, it retreats into the pores;\nWhen unfurled, it fills the vast expanse.\n\nThe *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\nObtain *One*, and all matters are complete.\nIf a person empties their heart,\n*The One* will naturally return.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*Qi* is the void that awaits things.\nOnly the *Dao* gathers the void.\nAgain, it says:\n*The empty chamber births white auspiciousness*—\nStop, stop.\n\nHeaven is the pure yang *qi*.\nAnd Heaven, obtaining it, thus moves vigorously and dynamically,\nIts dome vast and encompassing,\nIts symbols clear and bright—\nAll things derive their origin from it.\n\nEarth is the pure yin substance.\nAnd Earth, obtaining it, thus remains faithful, yielding, and weak,\nIts foundation firm and thickly bearing,\nIts stability unshaken—\nAll things derive their sustenance from it.\n\nThe *Spirit* is the subtle expression of all things.\nAnd the *Spirit*, obtaining it, thus transforms without limit,\nIts reversals endless,\nIts rectitude resonant and responsive—\nIts correspondence to things is inexhaustible.\n\nThe *Valley* is the deepest of the Han.\nAnd the *Valley*, obtaining it, thus moves *qi* and channels water,\nIts fullness unexhausted.\n\nThe *Ten Thousand* refers to the greatness of numbers.\n*Things* are the visible forms.\nAnd things, obtaining it, thus generate and complete without ceasing—\nTheir extinction is unknown.\n\nThe *Marquis* and *King* are the five ranks of nobility.\nThe *King* is the general term for ruler.\nObtaining it, they thus

      "translated_text": "*\"Without it\"* refers to the language of warning through consequences.\n\nHeaven is the manifestation of the *virtue/power* of Yang, the emblem of the sovereign. When it is said that Heaven lacks clarity, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of supreme luminosity, leading to discord between Yin and Yang, the collapse of order and principles, and the stagnation of the unified *qi*—thus risking the omen of fissures. Moreover, when Yang *qi* is excessive, calamities and decline must follow; when the harmonious balance disperses, fissures must occur. Thus, the *Yin-Yang Book* states: *\"Heaven’s cracking is the result of insufficient Yang *qi* and the decline of the sovereign’s virtue.\"*\n\nFrom here onward, all are words of admonition.\n\nEarth is the manifestation of the *virtue/power* of Yin, the emblem of the minister. When it is said that Earth lacks tranquility, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of serenity, leading to the distortion of firmness and softness, the collapse of mountains and rivers, and the failure to uphold the unified *qi*—thus risking the consequences of eruption and overflow. Moreover, when Yin *qi* reaches its extreme, there must be flooding disasters; when the harmonious balance dissipates, eruptions must occur. Thus, the *Yin-Yang Book* states: *\"Earthquakes arise from excess Yin *qi* and the neglect of the minister’s duty.\"*\n\nThe *Spirit* is the essence of transformation. All things with refined vitality possess their *Spirit*—an unfathomable interplay of Yin and Yang. When it is said that the *Spirit* lacks numinosity, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of supreme transformation, leading to the birth of calamities and omens, the rise of portents, and the abandonment of the unified *qi*—thus risking the time of cessation. When the *Spirit* strays from the *Way*, it harms the people; when the people are harmed, they rebel in destruction. Destruction without *Spirit*—what else but cessation?\n\nThe *Valley* is the void that receives all things. When it is said that the *Valley* lacks fullness, if it relies on itself as if on something secure, it loses the *Way* of flowing nourishment, leading to the fear of collapse and desolation, the obstruction of the unified *qi*—thus risking the isolation of exhaustion. Exhaustion affects the state, hence the Luo River’s drying led to the fall of Xia, and the Yellow River’s depletion caused the ruin of Shang.\n\nAll things have form and substance, destined to transform. When it is said that all things lack *generativity*, if they rely on themselves as if on something secure, they lose the *Way* of yielding compliance, leading to the inversion of nature’s order, the dispersal of the unified *qi*—thus risking the period of annihilation.\n\nThe sovereign unites the Three Realms as sovereign and governs all things. He must cultivate humility to nurture the talents of the people. When it is said that the sovereign lacks exalted nobility, if he relies on himself as if on something secure, he loses the *Way* of pure transformation, causing officials to neglect their duties, the people to abandon loyalty, and the risk of ruin and overthrow. All the matters mentioned above—though extending to Heaven and Earth—ultimately serve as warnings to the sovereign.\n\nIf the sovereign heeds these warnings, how much more should the common people?\n\nThus, nobility finds its foundation in humility, and height finds its base in lowliness.\n\nNobility—how can it arise from itself? It must be upheld by the humble, and only then does it attain nobility. This is the foundation of humility.\n\nHeight—how can it arise from itself? It must be borne by those beneath, and only then does it attain elevation. This is the base of lowliness.\n\nTherefore, the sovereign addresses himself as *\"lonely, widowed, and unworthy\"*—is this not the embodiment of humility as foundation? Is it not so? *\"Lonely, widowed, and unworthy\"* are terms of common reproach, yet the sovereign adopts them as titles, cultivating humility to avoid arrogance. Is this not the foundation of humility? And if it is not, then truly it is the foundation of humility.\n\nThus, when praised repeatedly, he does not take pride. A sage ruler forgets his name and self; though the world praises him often, he does not grow more encouraged. Though the world criticizes him often, he does not grow discouraged. How would he know whether he is truly noble or not?\n\nThe *Guoyu* text reads: *\"When praised repeatedly, there is no praise.\"* When considering the components of a chariot, there are wheels, axles, frames, and shafts—yet none is called a \"chariot\" alone. Only when combined do they form a chariot. When considering the components of a state, there are scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants—yet none is called a \"state\" alone. Only when combined do they form a state. How could a chariot be formed without its parts? How could a state survive without its people? This is a grave warning to the sovereign, urging him to love his people.\n\nHe does not wish to shine like jade, nor to be dull like stone.\n*Jianjian*—the appearance of jade.\n*Luoluo*—the appearance of stone.\nA sage ruler does not desire ostentation like jade, nor does he wish to be obscure like stone. Instead, he cultivates a hidden light, guarding the *Way* of the unified *qi*, becoming the model for all under Heaven.\n\nThe ancient text reads: *\"Like jade, like stone.\"* The transmitted versions by Yan Yuan and Xu Xian adopt this.\n\nHaving attained nobility and height, yet grounding himself in humility, addressing himself as lonely and widowed, repeatedly practicing modesty—this is why it is followed by the *Way* of return.\n\n*Return* is the movement of the *Way*.\n*Return* means restoration, transformation.\nThe origin of all things lies in emptiness and stillness.\nBefore things arise, they first return to the origin of emptiness and stillness. When they transform, they emerge from emptiness and stillness into motion—thus, first returning, then moving.\n\nTherefore, the *Yijing* states in the *Fu* (Return) hexagram:\n*\"The firm returns and moves, yielding and proceeding—\nThus, entering and exiting without haste—\nThis is what is meant.\"*\n\nThe weak are the application of the *Way*.\nSince returning to emptiness and stillness is the movement of the *Way*, then softness, weakness, and receptivity are truly the application of the *Way*.\n\nAll things under Heaven are born from existence, and existence is born from nonexistence.\nExistence is the One.\nThe One is the Original *Qi*.\nIt is said that all things under Heaven are born from the Original *Qi*. The Original *Qi* possesses light without form—though light and shadow emerge from the void.\n\nThe void is the substance of the *Way*.\n*The Liezi* states:\n*\"Formed things arise from the formless—\nThen how did Heaven and Earth come to be?\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"Movement without form does not produce form,\nYet produces shadow.\nSound without substance does not produce sound,\nYet produces echo.\nThe void in motion does not produce the void,\nYet produces existence.\"*\n\nThus, all things are born from existence, and existence is born from nonexistence—yet all things transform uniquely.\n\nYan Junping says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are born from Great Harmony,\nAnd Great Harmony is born from the void—\nThis is the origin of returning to emptiness and stillness.\"*",

moderate—\nthings the world does not use.\nHe retreats to marshes and valleys, seeking quiet and spaciousness,\nexhales the old and inhales the new,\nendures hardship like the bear and soars like the phoenix,\nmerely nurturing his body and preserving his spirit.\nBut when he is put to use by the world,\nhe speaks of great achievements,\nestablishes great reputation,\nhonors the relationships of lord and subject,\nrectifies the order of high and low,\nand governs affairs—\nthis is what is called as if it exists and as if it does not.\n\nThe inferior sage, by nature, is coarse and defiled—\nhis eyes crave to see colors,\nhis ears crave to hear sounds,\nhis mouth craves to savor flavors,\nhis intentions crave to be fulfilled.\nWhen he hears of serene tranquility and non-action,\nhe laughs loudly and rejects it.\nIf it is not rejected and laughed at by the inferior sage,\nthen it is not worthy to be the true *Dao*.\n\nYan Junping says:\n*\"The quail and partridge

face-to-face\"*—\nthose who awaken to the *Dao* hold their light within,\ntheir actions and demeanor like an unlit lamp.\nThus, the mediocre sage doubts its existence or non-existence,\nand the inferior sage laughs loudly at it.\n\n*\"Advancing the *Dao* seems like retreating\"*—\nThe superior sage reaches enlightenment without effort,\nmuch less does he advance it.\nEven with sage-like achievements,\nhe does not take them for himself,\nand in mingling with the dust and engaging with the world,\nit seems as if he is retreating and failing.\n\n*\"Equalizing the *Dao* as if it were a

      "translated_text": "Thus, things sometimes benefit when diminished,\nand are diminished when over-benefited.\n\nThere are things that can reduce emotional desires,\nthat do not boast of their own merits,\nand that lower themselves to preserve their essence.\nAs when kings and nobles adopt the titles *gū* (孤), *guǎ* (寡), and *bùgǔ* (不谷),\ntheir humility brings them greater honor and nobility.\nThe vulgar, however, seek only excess and fullness,\nand those who greedily pursue wealth and noble status,\nknowing no restraint, invite ruin and peril.\nThe *Shū* says: *\"Fullness invites loss, humility invites benefit.\"*\nWhen things are diminished by external means,\nit is the Dao’s way that brings true benefit.\nThe Dao’s benefit comes when things are diminished by their own nature.\n\nWhat humanity teaches is also what I teach.\nThe teachings of the world each assert their own *wǒ yì* (我义).\nAs with the hundred schools of thought,\neach establishes its own principles—\nthose whose intent is good are aligned with the sage’s teachings,\nwhile those whose intent is perverse become the arts of *zònghéng* (纵横).\nThe arts of *zònghéng* lead to entrapment by force and violence,\nand one cannot escape their consequences.\nThose who rely on force and violence cannot escape their fate—\nI shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\nGentleness and weakness belong to Yang, the principle of life;\nforce and violence belong to Yin, the principle of death.\nWhen rulers above are forceful and violent,\nthey lose the hearts of their people and meet downfall without delay.\nWhen subjects below are forceful and violence,\nthey are overthrown by the multitude, and ruin is imminent.\nTo *\"not escape their fate\"* means to die before one’s natural end.\n\nThe Master Lao observed the world’s deviation from the Dao\nand wrote these warnings for future generations,\nknowing that those who practice humility and gentleness will thrive,\nwhile those who indulge in greed and violence will perish.\nThus, he recorded these lessons to instruct posterity.\n*\"Father\"* (父) means origin, foundation.\nThe principle of *chōnghé* (冲和) with its humility invites benefit,\nwhile abandoning one’s own *wǒ yì* (我义) in favor of force and violence\nleads to ruin—\nhence, one must adhere to the utmost gentleness.\nTherefore, I follow it with the observation:\n*\"The Dao’s utmost gentleness overcomes the world’s utmost firmness.\"*\n\nThe gentlest thing is water,\nthe firmest are metal and stone.\n*\"Driving\"* (驰骋) describes its ceaseless flow,\nlike a swift steed racing without pause.\nWater, though supremely gentle,\ncan penetrate metal and stone through its use,\nand drown all things—\nthus it is said to *\"drive\"* past the world’s firmest substances.\nThe Dao is without form or boundary,\nyet it can encompass Heaven and Earth without end,\nand invade the minutest hairs without omission.\nHow could anything with form enter its boundless void?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Metal and stone cannot sound without emptiness—*\n*this refers to containing the Dao’s *qi* (气).\"*\nJun Ping remarked:\n*\"Things with form, though sharp, do not enter the formless;\nthe spirit’s wisdom moves within the body,\nemerging without boundary,\nentering without aperture—\nin the span of a breath, it traverses thousands of miles.\"*\nThus, I understand the benefits of *wúwéi* (无为).\n\n*\"I\"* (吾) is the Master Lao’s self-reference.\nThe Way of emptiness and nothingness,\ngentle and formless, yet penetrates all things.\nWang Bi said:\n*\"Nothingness cannot be exhausted,\ngentleness cannot be broken—\nfrom this, one knows the Dao of *wúwéi* (无为) benefits all.\"*\n\nThe teaching of silence and *wúwéi* (无为) is rarely attained.\nThe sage, observing the natural Dao of Heaven,\nadjusts his body and simplifies his actions,\nrefines his bearing and conduct to enlighten others—\nthus his teaching prevails without words.\nIf one resorts to forceful action,\nit leads to stagnation and harm to things.\nYet when one returns to *wúwéi* (无为),\nthe benefits are manifold—\nhence, the Way of quietude and simplicity\nis truly the supreme guardian of the world.\nFew attain it.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"Those who know me are rare—*\n*thus I am precious.\"*\n\nWenzi said:\n*\"Gao Yao sighed and established the great laws,\nand there was no cruelty in the world—\ndoes governance have greater value than words?\"*\nShi Kuang, though blind, became the Grand Steward,\nand the state of Jin knew no disorder—\ndoes administration have greater value than sight?\n\nThe sage’s commands are spoken without utterance,\nhis governance is seen without form—\nthis is how he becomes a teacher.\n\nGentleness and non-competition lie in *wúwéi* (无为).\nThe benefits of *wúwéi* (无为) are closest to one’s own body—\nthus, I follow with: *\"Which is dearer, name or body?\"*\n\nWhich is dearer, name or body?\nThe body is substance, the name is guest—\nto abandon substance for guest is called inversion.\nThe *Liézǐ* says:\n*\"Substance is poor, falsehood is rich;\nto say substance has no name while name has no substance—\nthis is falsehood indeed.\nYet those who chase fame relentlessly—\ncan fame truly be abandoned?\nCan fame truly be treated as a guest?\"*\n\nNow, having a name brings honor,\nlosing it brings disgrace.\nHonor brings ease and pleasure,\ndisgrace brings sorrow and suffering.\nSorrow and suffering harm one’s nature,\nease and pleasure align with it—\nthis is where the matter lies.\nHow can fame be abandoned?\nHow can it be treated as a guest?\nOnly to fear those who cling to fame,\nburdening their substance,\nand neglect the peril of ruin—\nis this not more than the difference between ease and suffering?\n\nBao Jiao extends this reasoning:\nThose who cling to fame and burden substance.\n\nWhich is more: body or wealth?\nWealth refers to resources and possessions.\nAll who dwell in riches and delight in their means of support\nare yet to find one who does not covet wealth.\nThe rich toil endlessly, day and night,\namassing treasure yet unable to enjoy it fully—\ntheir bodies are but external forms.\nThe noble fret through the night and day,\npondering whether their actions are good or bad—\ntheir bodies are but distant shadows.\nThough their halls be filled with gold and jade,\nif they lack virtue and benevolence,\nthey earn only the mockery of thieves and the scorn of those who hoard wealth—\nand when their families fall and their bodies are shamed,\nwhat greater loss is there?\n\nTo gain or to lose—\nwhich brings greater harm?\nFalse fame and fleeting profit\nare as light as a feather,\nwhile the loss of life, body, spirit, and nature\nis as heavy as a great mountain.\nA discerning person weighs which is the greater affliction.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"To nourish one’s will is to forget the body;\nto nourish the body is to forget profit;\nto attain the Dao is to lose the heart—*\n*it is gone.\"*\n\nThus, excessive love brings great depletion,\nand excessive hoarding invites heavy loss.\n*\"Depletion\"* (费) means harm.",

      "translated_text": "For the cause of crime, nothing is heavier than this.\n\n*The Liezi* says: A man from Qi desired gold. At dawn, he dressed formally and went to the market, arriving at the place where gold was sold. There, he seized the gold and fled. The sheriff captured him and asked, *\"All were present—why did you seize another’s gold?\"* He replied, *\"When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold. Like gazing into murky water and losing oneself in a clear pool.\"* No greater calamity exists than **unknowing contentment**.\n\nCalamity—harm. Among the things one may desire, even within greed, there are limits. But the unknowingly contented—whatever passes before their eyes, they take nothing, yet their cup overflows without spilling. Ruin and disaster follow, so no calamity surpasses **unknowing contentment**.\n\nNo greater misfortune exists than **desiring to possess**. Misfortune—ruin. Even the things that pass before one’s eyes have bounds. If one desires all under heaven—seen and unseen—and seeks to hoard them all, leaving none untaken, this is the height of **without-Dao**. How could ruin not befall oneself alone? It also brings ruin to future generations.\n\nCrime speaks of transgressing prohibitions. The first offense is called *guilt*; the Daoists call it *overt*. The Classics say: *\"The first offense is guilt, also called error.\"* Error—mistake. To commit error a thousand eight hundred times brings *calamity*, heavier than guilt. To commit error two thousand one hundred sixty times brings *misfortune*, heavier still than calamity. These three are all deeds of **without-Dao**. The small harms the body; the great destroys the state. How could one not take warning?\n\nThus, **knowing contentment’s contentment** is always contentment. Though external things may suffice, if the heart does not know contentment, this is called **unknowing contentment**. Though external things may lack, if the heart remains content, this is called **knowing contentment**.\n\n*The High Sage’s Transmission* says: The strict **Yán Jūn Píng** was friendly with the wealthy man **Luō Chōng** of Shu Commandery. Hearing that Jūn Píng declined an official summons, Chōng asked, *\"Why do you not seek office?\"* Jūn Píng replied, *\"I lack the will to rise.\"* Chōng then prepared carriages, horses, provisions, and attendants. Jūn Píng said, *\"I am ill—it is not lack.\"* *\"I have abundance, yet you have not even a single coin—how can you say you have excess?\"* Chōng retorted. Jūn Píng said, *\"I once lodged in your home. When others slept, your servants labored without rest, day and night, ceaselessly—never content. Now I earn by divination; money comes without effort, and I have tens of thousands in surplus, piled high. I do not know what to do with it. How can you say I have excess while you lack?\"*\n\nChōng withdrew, deceiving himself: *\"He who enriches me diminishes my spirit; he who gives me fame destroys my life. If one truly knows contentment’s contentment, how could **battle-horses breed in the borderlands**, or calamity and misfortune be so heavy?\"*\n\nThe Dao is nowhere absent—why seek it far? Thus, it follows: *\"Do not leave the door, and you know the world.\"* Not leaving the door, one knows the world. The sage’s governance begins with self and heart, measuring near before reaching far. Without descending from the ancestral hall, one knows beyond the four seas. By observing things, one recognizes things; by knowing people, one understands people. When eating, think of the world’s hunger; when clothing, think of the world’s cold. Loving one’s elders reveals the world’s aged; pitying one’s children reveals the world’s young. If such, why leave the door to know the world?\n\n*\"Without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.\"* A man’s seven-foot frame—four limbs, nine orifices, five viscera, six palaces—all contained within. Thus, the original *qi* of the body communicates with the Dao of Heaven. If the ruler preserves form in stillness, the Heavenly *qi* ascends bright and self-corrects. If the ruler indulges in excess desires, the Heavenly *qi* grows dim and turbid. The ruler, sharing virtue with the Two Forces, aligns with the sun and moon in clarity. Leading Heaven, Heaven does not resist; following Heaven, one honors its timing. Without peering through windows or gazing afar, the Dao of Heaven is self-evident.\n\nYán Jūn Píng said: Thus, the sage does not leave the door. Above, he examines parents; below, he measures descendants. Danger, security, profit, and harm return to himself, so he is clear on the sayings of death and life, discerning in right and wrong, comprehending the roots of profit and harm, reaching the foundation of order and chaos. Knowing oneself, one knows the family; knowing the family, one knows others. Affairs grasp their principles; things follow their order. In motion, one knows where to go; in stillness, one knows what to guard. Virtue and power are father; spirit and clarity are mother; stillness and purity are teacher; Great Harmony is friend. The world is home; all things are body. View others as oneself; view oneself as others. The heart dares not stir; the will dares not rise. Abandoning old knowledge, extinguishing the three and five, one does not dwell in cliffs or caves, does not slaughter living things, does not eat raw plants, does not wear unripe fruits, does not pluck before maturity. Heaven, Earth, and all things each preserve their own. This is called, within the unity of the body, modeling Heaven, Earth, and all things.\n\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows. The ruler who loses the Dao cannot model Heaven or walk the Way, yet relies on cleverness to discern things. The farther he seeks, the less he knows. Jūn Píng said: *\"Examining Heaven and Earth, verifying past and present, actions never contradict—thus I know the Dao of Heaven is complete within me.\"* The family is the root of knowing people. The body is the source of knowing Heaven and Earth. To observe the world without the body is to observe people without the family. Near is small, far is great; small knowledge leads to great confusion. Leaving the family and the door, one does not see the world. Leaving the body to peer through windows, one does not know the Dao of Heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows. Wandering the four seas, one is ever more confused. The more one seeks, the greater the pursuit; the greater the pursuit, the smaller the achievement. Without seeing or hearing, seek within oneself. At the juncture of Heaven and man, the Great Dao is complete.",

      "translated_text": "To govern the realm, first govern one’s own country; to govern one’s country, first govern one’s family; to govern one’s family, first govern one’s self; to govern one’s self, first cultivate one’s heart; to cultivate one’s heart, first rectify one’s intentions.\n\nThus, the virtuous person, if not sincere, will see all things turn against them—this refers to the body and the heart. Therefore, the Sage acts without movement yet knows, does not see yet names.\n\nThe Sage, though not traversing the world, yet discerns human affairs by observing the self within the self and knowing the outer through the inner—this is called *solitary enlightenment*.\n\nThe Sage, though not witnessing celestial omens, yet can name and command the Dao of Heaven by examining the small to comprehend the great, clarifying the near to illuminate the far—this is called *mysterious contemplation*.\n\nThe Sage achieves without action. The Sage transforms the world without contrivance, merely illuminating the natural inclinations of things and following their course.\n\nConfucius said: *\"He who governs without action—is he not Shun?\"*\n\nTo learn is to grow daily, yet the Dao is diminished daily. The Dao grows through learning, but once grown, it must be diminished; knowing the child yet guarding the mother, returning to the origin—this is the root.\n\nReturning to the origin, one must first discard cleverness and grasp the essential. Clinging to the vital and holding fast to the root, the Dao is diminished daily—this is entering the realm of boundless mystery.\n\nDiminish again and again, until one reaches *non-action*. When one acts without contrivance, there is nothing that cannot be achieved.\n\nThe one who diminishes does not force gain nor discard what is extraneous. When one discards until one forgets what is wrong, then there is nothing minute that is not removed. When one removes until one forgets what is right, wrong is not wrong, and right is not right.\n\nHaving diminished what is wrong and what is right, it is said: *\"Diminish again and again.\"* If both right and wrong are forgotten, self-interest naturally vanishes, and nature aligns with the Dao, reaching *non-action*. Once in *non-action*, one does not compete with things, but lets all things follow their own course. Thus, all things are achieved without contrivance.\n\nTo take the world, one must act with *non-interference*. When there are affairs to attend, it is insufficient to take the world. The Sage and the virtuous follow the Dao: first cultivating the self and the heart, then extending to the world.\n\nEarlier, it was said to govern the self through *non-action*; now it is said to govern the world through *non-interference*. Thus, the Sage’s way of thinking is always concerned with one thing’s loss of place, and the key to rectifying flaws and chaos lies in taking the hearts of all under Heaven.\n\nTo take the hearts of all under Heaven, one must use *non-interference* as defense, *non-action* as guidance, and *non-desire* as treasure. When the people naturally transform into simplicity and tranquility, they willingly embrace and do not tire of it.\n\nIf one governs through contrivance and interference, the people will labor under burdensome rule, stand in dread, and criticize in secret. How can one then take the hearts of all under Heaven?\n\nOnce growth leads to diminishment, and diminishment reaches *non-heart*, it is said: *\"The Sage has no fixed heart.\"* The Sage takes the hearts of the people as their own.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao with an empty heart; things respond to their own nature, and since responses are not uniform, the Sage’s heart remains without fixed inclination.\n\nYet the hearts of the people always desire to secure their lives and fulfill their nature. The Sage who lets all people attain what they desire—is he not the one who takes the hearts of the people as their own?\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"The Perfect One’s use of heart is like a balance scale—neither pushing nor pulling, responding without storing. Thus, they can overcome things without harming themselves.\"* The Sage has no fixed heart.\n\nTo those who are good, I am good to them; to those who are not good, I am also good to them—*virtue* is goodness.\n\nThe people have a natural inclination toward goodness. The Sage does not contradict their nature, responding with goodness. Those whose nature is inherently good, the Sage further aids with greater goodness, ensuring their goodness is perfected.\n\nIf there are those whose nature is not good, the Sage still treats them with goodness. Under the influence of the Sage’s *virtue*, their hearts naturally shift toward goodness.\n\nThus, there are none in the world who are not good—this is the Sage’s way of harmonizing with natural inclinations to complete transformation, not forcing things to conform to themselves.\n\nTo those who are trustworthy, I trust them; to those who are not, I also trust them—*virtue* is trust.\n\nThe people have a natural sincerity toward trustworthiness. The Sage does not suppress their resolve, responding with trust. Those whose trust is firm, the Sage aids with greater trust, ensuring their trust is perfected.\n\nIf there are those who are not sincere in their trust, the Sage still treats them with trust. The untrustworthy, influenced by the Sage’s *virtue*, naturally awaken their sincerity into trust.\n\nThus, there are none in the world who are not trustworthy—this is the Sage’s ability to accommodate human nature, not out of love or self-interest.\n\nThe Sage moves through the world with *solemn vigilance*, regulating the hearts of all under Heaven.\n\n*Solemn vigilance* is the appearance of concern and movement, yet never ceasing. *Undivided* means without distinction.\n\nIn ancient times, rulers in the world, though their governance appeared concerned and active, shared in the people’s affairs, yet their hearts remained serene and empty, aligned with nature. Thus, they could embody transformation, harmonize change, and reach nothing that could not be achieved. They balanced all things as one, and nothing was left untransformed.\n\nFor the people of the world, the Sage makes their hearts undivided and their desires unified, follows their nature to harmonize their transformation—who would not willingly embrace this?\n\nTo labor over the mind and exhaust thought, treating affairs as affairs, is to achieve something. Lu Xi-sheng said: *\"When the Sage is present, the world is in awe. Responding to things and their influences, they never cease, yet their heart is undivided, in harmony with all under Heaven. They never have their own agenda.\"*\n\nThus, the four things that Master Zhongni renounced were: *no intentions*, *no absolutes*, *no rigidity*, *no self*.\n\nTherefore, they could achieve *no may or may not* and *no action or inaction*.\n\nThe *Riverbank Master*’s text reads: *\"chùchù\"* (怵怵).",

      "translated_text": "The *King Pi* version reads: *\"xīxī\"* (歙歙).\n\nThe common people all pour their ears and eyes into [worldly] affairs, while the Sage treats them as children.\n\n*\"Zhù\"* (注) means to pour forth, to apply.\nThe Sage cultivates with *wuwei* as virtue, never opposing the natural inclinations of all things. Thus, the people are bathed in their sacred virtue, each fulfilling their inherent capacities.\n\nThe wise are made to scorn, the perceptive to listen—all pour their ears and eyes into imitating the Sage’s natural Way. Yet the Sage, his crown flowing loose, his gaze distant, his ears blocked, does not strain his body with cleverness nor probe the hidden in things. He cradles the common folk in his thoughts, treating them all as infants—thus it is said: *\"to treat them as children.\"*\n\nWithout fixed intentions, one is undivided. Responding to transformations as a child does, one obscures life and death—hence the next stage: *birth and death*.\n\n**Birth and Death:**\nFrom emptiness arises natural spontaneity; from spontaneity arises the Dao; from the Dao arises *yī qì*—one breath, which transforms and gives rise to all things. Thus it is called *birth*.\nAt the peak of life, transformation renders it formless—thus it is called *entering death*.\nThis is yet confined within the realm of beginning and end.\n\nTo transcend this realm, how could life and death ever bind one?\n\nThere are thirteen categories of those who cling to life, and thirteen of those who court death.\n*\"Tú\"* (徒) means kind, type.\n\nThose who cling to life: those who practice *shèshēng* (摄生) fall into this category.\nThose who court death: those who rush toward death fall into this category.\nThe thirteen: as Han Fei said: four limbs, nine orifices—thirteen in total, their movement and stillness all tied to life and death.\n\nNow, the adept at *shèshēng* does not wastefully gaze, does not wastefully listen, does not wastefully smell, does not wastefully speak, does not wastefully grasp, does not wastefully tread—his movements and stillness are effortless, committing no evil. These are the ranks of those who seek longevity.\n\nThose who court death, however, let their eyes wander over garish colors, their ears indulge in wanton sounds, their noses grow weary of foul odors, their mouths crave what is unrighteous, their hands favor wicked tools, their feet quicken on forbidden paths. Their movements and stillness are drowned in vice, with no virtue remaining—these are the ranks of those near death.\n\nThe roots of life and death all hinge on these thirteen matters.\n\nSun Deng said: Among the things of Heaven and Earth, those that align with nature are few, while those that defy it are many. Thus, in ten cases, only three follow nature.\n\nNow, life not lived in accordance with the Dao, death not met with reason—those who follow life are few, while those who defy death are many. Hence, in death, only three submit to fate.\n\nSome interpret this as: the threefold business of ten evils—those who master and subdue them belong to the ranks of longevity. Those who indulge belong to the ranks of near-death.\n\nBy reasoning through it, the nine orifices and four limbs are the most thoroughly discussed.\nHuman life is a descent into death’s domain through these thirteen matters.\n\nNow, why is it that people’s ordinary actions lead them toward death’s domain?\nIt is because they are seduced by desire for gain.\nThey crave rich flavors, fine silks, beautiful colors, pleasing sounds—all to indulge the nine orifices and four limbs. Thus their movements are strained, as if compelled against their will, yet they fall into death’s domain without knowing it. None escape the thirteen matters.\n\nWhy is this?\nBecause those who advance life excessively do so at the expense of their own substance.\n*\"Shēngshēng\"* (生生) means to further life.\nTo forget life’s weight upon oneself is to hope for longevity, while to advance life at one’s own expense is to draw near death’s domain.\n\nMoreover, to advance life must first rely on external things. Though external things suffice to preserve the body and delight the nature, serving as means for prolonged life, yet those who forget themselves in their greed for wealth overreach in seeking life-preserving things, letting the thirteen matters slide into chaos and hastening themselves toward death’s domain.\n\nIt is said that the adept at *shèshēng* does not speak of *shèshēng*—*\"swēi wén\"* (盖闻) is a humble phrase.\n*\"Shè\"* means to guard. Within guarding life, they grasp its subtleties, hence the adept at *shèshēng*.\nTraveling on foot, they avoid rhinoceros and tigers; entering battle, they wear no armor.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to strike with its horn, the tiger no place to strike with its claws, weapons no place to lodge their blades.\nThey meet without design.",

      "translated_text": "「The rhinoceros emerges from the southern banks of the Xiang River, its hue a deep azure-black, its form resembling a wild ox, with a single horn weighing a thousand *jīn* [~220 lbs].\n\nThe adept at *shèshēng* [guarding life] attains internally to the self, so all illnesses fail to arise. Externally, they harmonize with things, so all calamities cannot befall them. When they abandon all selfish gain, they naturally meet with fortune.\n\nOf all the harms that tools bring, none surpass the sword and spear. Among beasts, none are fiercer than the tiger and rhinoceros. Thus, though the sword and spear stand before them, they are not alarmed—this is because there is no place for their blades to lodge. Though tiger and rhinoceros block their path, they are not startled—this is because there is no place for their claws and horns to strike. Hence, though all calamities assail the sentient, they cannot harm the unsentient.\n\nWhy is this? Asking why all calamities do not assail and spare the adept at *shèshēng* [guarding life]—it is because they have no place of death.\n\nThe supreme person does not indulge their inner desires, nor do they harbor outward harm toward things. Thus, they can forget the self while the self remains, for they have no place of death.\n\nZhuangzi said: Those who grasp the Dao/Way must reach *lǐ* [principle/reason], those who reach principle must discern *quán* [opportunity/strategic measure], and those who discern opportunity will not let external things harm them. The virtuous/powerful ones are not scorched by fire, drowned by water, harmed by cold or heat, or preyed upon by birds and beasts—not because they are callous, but because they perceive danger and safety, rest in calamity and blessing, and are cautious in departure and approach. None can harm them.\n\nTo die is to lose the Dao/Way; to awaken is for the Dao/Way to arise. Thus, it follows with *dào shēng zhī* [the Dao/Way giving birth to it].\n\nThe Dao/Way gives birth to it, and virtue/power nurtures it. The Dao/Way is the essence of emptiness. Virtue/power is the function of nature. The Dao/Way’s essence is emptiness, yet through movement it gives rise to things. All things receive *qi* from the Dao/Way, hence it is said to give birth to them.\n\nVirtue/power’s function is natural, encompassing and nurturing things. Things take form from virtue/power, hence it is said to nurture them.\n\nThings are shaped by their form, and their fate is completed by their circumstances. All creatures and plants are rooted in the Dao/Way and born, sustained by virtue/power, and when their material is fully formed, they take shape, hence it is said to shape them.\n\nOnce things have taken form, they follow the changes of the four seasons to reach completion. Thus, all things cannot but revere the Dao/Way and honor virtue/power.\n\nThe Dao/Way descends as pure essence, giving birth to the nature of things. Virtue/power contains harmonious *qi*, nurturing the form of things. Hence, all things revere and honor the Dao/Way as if it were their father, and virtue/power as if it were their mother.\n\nThe reverence of the Dao/Way and the honor of virtue/power—none can confer rank upon them, yet they are always naturally present. Rank is the bestowal of command. The example of this is the titles of duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron.\n\nThe reason the world holds things in reverence and honor is because the sovereigns bestow rank and command upon them. Yet the Dao/Way, with its pure essence, gives birth to things, and all things naturally revere it like a father. Virtue/power, with its harmonious *qi*, nurtures things, and all things naturally honor it like a mother.\n\nAll things universally receive the Dao/Way’s and virtue/power’s nurturing and completing functions, revering and honoring them as if they were parents—not because of conferred rank, but because they are always naturally present and have the power to guard and subdue.\n\nThus, the Dao/Way gives birth to it, nurtures it, lengthens it, educates it, completes it, ripens it, sustains it, and protects it. Earlier, it spoke of the Dao/Way giving birth and virtue/power nurturing, but here it does not mention virtue/power, for the Dao/Way permeates all without omission.\n\nTo receive its essence is to be born, to contain its *qi* is to nurture, to fulfill its form is to lengthen, to refine its nature is to educate, to aid its function is to complete, to bring it to its end is to ripen, to preserve its harmony is to sustain, and to guard its injuries is to protect. These eight are the fundamental functions of the Great Dao/Way. Even the most minute of creatures—those that dart and creep—cannot escape its reverence and honor.\n\nBorn yet not possessed, acting yet not relying, lengthening yet not ruling—this is called *Xuán Dé* [Mysterious Virtue/Power]. This concludes the eight meanings above.\n\nIf the Dao/Way were said to give birth to all things as if it had possession, then its benevolence would be diminished. If it were said to nurture all things as if relying on its actions, then it would claim its function. If it were said to lengthen and educate all things, completing and ripening all types, sustaining and protecting all creatures and plants, as if it were proud of its rule—then it would be seen as presuming its length. With these attributes yet remaining hidden in secrecy, one can say its mysterious virtue/power is profound and distant.\n\nThe Dao/Way gives birth and virtue/power nurtures, providing things with their beginning. Thus, it follows with *tiānxià yǒu shǐ* [the world having a beginning].\n\nThe world having a beginning, the Dao/Way is the mother of the world. Once one has obtained its mother, one knows its child. The beginning is the Dao/Way, the root, the nameless.\n\nThe mother is nurturing, the named. The Dao/Way externally encompasses Heaven and Earth, internally fills the cosmos. All things draw upon it to be born and follow it to reach completion. That which completes is the child, that which gives birth is the mother.\n\nThe child is the One, and the One is the *chōngqì* [primordial breath], the Dao/Way’s child. The Dao/Way is the body of true essence, and the One is the function of wondrous things. Once the Dao/Way’s body is obtained, one knows the wondrous function. Body and function are interdependent, merging in the ultimate emptiness.\n\nHaving known the child, one again guards the mother. Thus, throughout life, one is unharmed. Having known the wondrous function of things, one again guards the true essence of the Dao/Way. Body and function become indistinguishably one, responding to stimuli without end, and only then can one act without doing and achieve all without action—thus, throughout life, one is unharmed.\n\nClose its *duì* [joyous/pleasure], shut its gates—then one will labor not a day in their life. This illustrates the practice of cutting off desire and guarding the mother.\n\n*Duì* means delight. It refers to the ears and eyes delighting in sounds and colors, the nose and mouth delighting in scents and flavors. The six senses each have their delights, and gates signify the paths of entry and exit.\n\nThe ears, eyes, and all the senses are the means by which dust and defilements enter. If one seals the gates of love and delight, then misfortune ceases and the body does not toil.\n\nAgain, *duì* is the eyes. If one closes the insatiable gaze, then all scenes will be cut off. Gates are the rivers. If one stops the mouth that speaks excessively, then all calamities will not approach.\n\nWhen all scenes are cut off, the source of desires is sealed. When all calamities cease, the path to action is closed. Thus, one will be tranquil and at ease, laboring not a day in their life.\n\nOpen its *duì* [joyous/pleasure], and its affairs will flourish—yet one’s life will never be saved. If one does not guard the mother Dao/Way, opening the source of love and delight without sealing it, then the emotions of desire will grow ever longer.»",

      "translated_text": "If the path of calamities is left open and not closed, then the affairs of misfortune will flourish. Thus, one will face sorrow, suffering, peril, and death, and never be saved.\n\nTo perceive the small is called clarity; to uphold softness is called strength. This is called preventing before sprouting, governing before chaos arises.\n\nWhen calamities and chaos have not yet appeared, they are small—yet clearly visible, that is clarity. If one knows the arts of sealing *duì* and closing the gates, then one sees the subtle and minute.\n\nDulling the sharpness of desires and dissolving the turmoil of calamities—this is upholding softness and weakness. To uphold softness and weakness means that things cannot overpower one; this is called strength. To see the subtle and minute means that affairs cannot become obscured; this is called clarity.\n\nEmploy its luminosity, and return to its clarity. Luminosity is the illumination of wisdom. Wisdom arises externally, externally shines, and is ever in motion—motion is the function of things. Clarity is insightful understanding. Insight dwells internally, internally reflects, and remains ever still—stillness is one’s true nature. When wisdom shines outward, it responds to affairs; when it returns, it aligns with principle. Thus, function returns to essence, and it is said: *return to its clarity*.\n\nThis is a further elucidation of perceiving the small and upholding softness, causing the external to cease and the internal to return. To leave no harm to the self is called *clinging to the constant*.\n\n*Heru* (遗) means to bestow or to leave behind. If affairs and principle are both clear, essence and function merge in obscurity, and one does not enslave wisdom’s external illumination while guarding insight’s internal reflection—returning desires before they sprout and restoring them to the primal Mother Dao—then there will be no self-inflicted harm, and this is called *secretly employing the constant Dao*.\n\nTo have a beginning and an end, to know the Child while guarding the Mother, to seal and close love and delight—is this not the upright and discerning? Thus, it follows with: *If one makes the upright and discerning have knowledge*.\n\nIf the upright and discerning have knowledge, walking the Great Dao, only their actions are to be feared. *Jie* (介) means solitary, upright, and resolute. Alas, if in this age one does not follow the ancient Dao, then it is said: *If one makes the solitary and resolute scholar have knowledge of governance, then they will walk the Great Dao*.\n\nThe Great Dao is the Way of effortless clarity, utmost fairness, and utmost straightforwardness. Yet those who walk the Dao must have actions. If actions are simple and easy, they guide the people toward the realm of clarity. If actions are convoluted and vexing, they lead the people toward greed and filth.\n\nOnly actions are to be feared—feared that they do not conform to the ancient Dao. The Great Dao is exceedingly smooth, yet people love shortcuts. The Great Dao is exceedingly smooth, like a grand thoroughfare. A grand thoroughfare is level and easy, reaching everywhere without obstruction, for its vast straightness does not fear minor detours. Yet people desire speed, seeking shortcuts, and thus become entangled in rugged paths, lost and confused, never reaching their destination.\n\nTherefore, the Ancient Sage lamented this, cautioning only the methods of instruction, making them feared, and guiding the people along the broad path—referring to the following passage.\n\nThe palace halls are excessively cleared,\nThe fields are overgrown with weeds,\nThe granaries are empty,\nYet adornments are worn,\nFine silks and embroidered patterns are displayed,\nSharp swords are carried,\nBeasts are fed sumptuous foods,\nAnd wealth and goods abound.\n\nHan Fei commented: *\"Resource and goods are in excess.\"*",

Observe the fields overgrown with weeds, agriculture neglected—then one knows the sovereign relishes forced labor, seizing the people’s time. Observe the granaries empty, farmers starving—then one knows the sovereign favors frivolous pursuits while abandoning essential livelihoods. Observe garments adorned with excessive embroidery, substance abandoned for superficial ornamentation—then one knows the sovereign indulges in licentious craftsmanship and exploits female labor. Observe belts adorned with sharp swords, valorized strength and martial competition—then one knows the sovereign cherishes martial prowess while neglecting governance. Observe feasts rejecting plain fare, savoring rich meats and fresh kills—then one knows the sovereign revels in gluttony and forgets state affairs. Observe wealth and goods in surplus, hoarding rare treasures—then one knows the sovereign amasses riches, impoverishing the people.\n\nConfucius said: *\"If the people lack, how can the sovereign suffice?\"*\nIf plunder continues unchecked, the people’s strength will be exhausted—this is not the Dao of the Sage.\nThis is called *robberious boasting*, not the Way.\n\nThe seven misdeeds above all rely on deceitful expansion, seizing the people covertly without principle—thus, they are theft. Already thieves, yet they still boast grandly—hence, *robberious boasting* is not the Way.\nThis is what is meant by *\"only instruction should be feared\"*—here lies its proof.\n\nThose who know the Way and practice it well have virtue that cannot be undermined by teaching, hence the next step: establishing what cannot be uprooted.\nThose who establish well cannot be uprooted—*establish* means *to stand firm*. Those who stand firm in the Way, rooting their person and nation, first solidify their foundation before cultivating their branches, thus their roots run deep and their branches flourish, making them unshakable.\n\nThose who embrace well do not lose—*lose* means *to depart*. *Separate* means *to detach*. Those who embrace the people with the Way have them loyal and undetected. Those who embrace the primal unity with the Way preserve their spirit whole and unlost.

By this.\nThe Ancient Sage spoke: *\"How do I know that those aligned with the Way prosper while those who abandon it perish?\"*\nThe answer: By the five observations I have laid out, scrutinized in reflection—thus I know.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"Without leaving one’s door, one knows the world.\"*\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Observe my life, observe the people.\"*—is this not its meaning?\n\nTo establish oneself and one’s nation with the Way, virtue extending to the world—how profound their contained virtue must be!

foundation;\nstems are the flower’s base.\nHe who cultivates fruit trees,\nwhen their roots are deep, their stems are firm—\neven if great winds arise,\nthey cannot uproot the foundation\nnor shake the fruit from its place.\nThus, deep roots yield flourishing branches,\nand firm stems ensure the fruit does not fall—\nthis is what is called enduring long.\n\nThe ruler who accumulates virtue,\nin governing people and serving Heaven,\nnourishes his land and sustains his people—\nplants his roots in *wuwei* (non-action),\nand secures his stems in *qīngjìng* (serene tranquility).\nThen the altars of soil and grain extend far,\nand this is called enduring life;\nhis reign is ever bright,\nand this is called lasting vision.\n\nDu Guāngtíng said:\nThose who cultivate the Dao/Way,\nharmonize their spirit and body,\naccumulate *qi* and preserve their wholeness,\nfortify their inner gates (*sānjiān*) while relaxing all concerns—\nall spirits submit in order,\nall affairs proceed in harmony,\ntransformation knows no bounds,\nand their years are long and enduring.\nTheir stems are rooted in the *Hùnyuán* (Primordial Domain),\ntheir roots run deep in the *Wúhé* (Land of No-Where),\nand they stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Nine Elders and Seven Ancients.\n\nThe ancient text read: *\"deep roots and firm stems\"* (*shēnguì*).\nServing Heaven and accumulating virtue,\none may have a realm—\nthus it follows with governing great states.\n\nGoverning great states is like cooking small fish.\nTo govern a realm of ten thousand chariots (*wànshèng zhī guó*),\nis like cooking a fish of mere inches—\nadjusting the water and fire,\nletting it cook naturally, then it is whole and perfect.\nAgitate it, and the fish is harmed;\nthe fish harmed, it rots and decays.\nA skilled ruler nurtures his people,\nharmonizing his governance and teachings,\nletting them find their own way—\nthen they are naturally at ease.\nDisturb them, and the people are harmed;\nthe people harmed, they grow chaotic and rebellious.\n\nWhen the Dao/Way permeates all under Heaven,\nits spirits are not fearsome.\nThe Sage employs the *wuwei* Dao/Way of serene tranquility,\nand as he moves through the world,\nhis harmonizing *qi* spreads across all lands—\nin valleys, valleys are full;\nin ravines, ravines are full.\nThus winds and rains come in season,\nfloods and droughts do not arise,\nhuman hearts remain natural,\nand no one seeks false blessings.\nThough spirits and deities exist,\nthey dare not display their fearsome transformations.\nThe *Xīshēng Jīng* says:\n*\"This is the Dao/Way of natural assistance—\nnot skilled in ritual sacrifice (*cí*),\nyet spirits flee of their own accord.\"*\n\nSpirits are the essence of transformation.\nIt is not that their spirits are not fearsome,\nbut that their fearsome transformations do not harm the people.\nIt is not that their spirits lack transformation,\nbut that their fearsome changes cease and vanish.\nThis arises from the people not making disorder—\nthen calamities and disasters (*qìxiáng*) how could they emerge?\nWhen people uphold their constant virtue,\nspirits’ fearsome transformations have no cause to harm the people—\nthis is the natural order.\nIt is not that the spirits do not harm the people,\nnor that the Sage harms the people.\nTheir spirits, though fearsome, do not harm the people,\nbecause the Sage’s *wuwei* and serene tranquility\nmove the spirits and deities to sense his radiant virtue,\nand they themselves regulate their shadowy essences (*yīnlíng*).\n\nThe words of *Lièzi* on the Sage’s governance:\nHe neither gives nor bestows favors,\nyet all things find sufficiency;\nhe neither hoards nor collects,\nyet nothing is lacking.\nThe harmony of *yin* and *yang* is constant,\nthe sun and moon shine eternally,\nthe four seasons follow their course,\nwinds and rains are ever balanced,\nthe people are nurtured in

not harm each other,\ntheir virtues return in harmony.\nThe two are the Sage and the spirits.\nHé Shànggōng said:\nThe two do not harm each other—\npeople are governed by the *yang*,\nspirits by the *yin*;\npeople preserve their lives,\nspirits preserve their spirits—\nthus their virtues return in harmony.\nMoreover, when the ruler can preserve the spirits,\nthe spirits can bless the ruler—\nand this is called the return of virtue.\n\nDu Guāngtíng said:\nThe people are the foundation of the state;\nwhen the foundation is firm, the state is secure.\nThe people are the masters of the spirits;\nwhen the master is at peace, the spirits are content.\nThe Sage governs through the Dao/Way—\nsince he does not harm people or spirits,\nthe spirits, moved by the Sage’s achievements,\nalso do not harm the world.\nThe two take joy in each other,\ntheir virtues return in harmony.\n\nGreat states govern through serene tranquility to secure the small,\nthus it follows with the small states beneath them.\n\nGreat states are the lowest currents (*xiàliú*),\nthe confluence of all under Heaven.\nThe seas and rivers can be kings of all valleys\nbecause they excel in descending;\ngreat states can be emperors of all lands\nbecause they excel in humility and descending—\nthus they are where all under Heaven’s subjects gather.\n\nThe confluence of all under Heaven is female (*pín*),\nfor the female ever conquers the male through tranquility,\nand the female is ever the descending one.\n\n*(Continuing from the previous text:)*\nThe great state’s excellence in descending\nis what makes it the confluence of all under Heaven.\n\nThe great state, though mighty, forgets its might—\nthus no small state escapes its embrace.\nIn high position yet humble in descent,\nit does not rely on coercive force or arms—\nso neighboring states submit in gentleness,\nall willingly becoming its servants and subjects,\nthus winning the small states’ affection.\n\nYán Jūnping said:\nThe enlightened kings and sage rulers,\nwhen governing great states,\nbestow without expecting return,\ndescend without demanding obedience—\nthey enfold the lands of all feudal lords (*zhūhóu*)\nyet none dare to fear them;\ntheir virtue encompasses the strength of all feudal lords,\nyet none dare to resist them.\nThey lower their station to align with others’ intentions,\nprioritizing loyalty, integrity, and sincere trust,\nholding scholars and worthies in esteem—\nthey cede land to attract virtuous talent,\nencourage agriculture and weaving to amass wealth,\nemploy alliances and counter-alliances to guard against unforeseen threats,\nopen their granaries and distribute wealth,\nsupport the aged and care for orphans,\nrelieve the poor and aid the distressed—\nthey honor reclusive worthies,\nbestowing gifts yet not seizing them,\ngranting authority yet not claiming it,\npracticing gentleness and simplicity,\nemploying *wuwei* in governance.\nThough feudal lords may be greedy, cruel, or arrogant,\nrelying on brute force or their own might,\nthey are still subdued by the weight of the great state’s virtue—\nwhen it descends in tranquility and humility,\nthose rulers regulate

largest of jades.\nFour horses harnessed together pull a single carriage.\nIn ancient times, when feudal lords paid homage to the Son of Heaven,\nassembled at great states, or visited small ones,\nor met in the wilds,\nwhen two rulers faced each other,\nthey observed the ritual of presenting tribute first—\nleading with gifts and currency, called 'advancing' (先).\nNow, the Three Ministers should prioritize discussing the Dao\nand governing the realm.\nEven if they wished to offer four-horse chariots and great jades to the ruler,\nit would still be the duty of subjects.\nSuch gifts only benefit licentious extravagance,\nbut contribute nothing to governance.\nIt is far better to advance the Dao of *wuwei* (無為) and serene stillness\nto transform the world—\nso that the unvirtuous turn to goodness,\nthe unrepentant change their hearts,\nand the Way’s transformation spreads universally,\nwhile imperial virtue extends far and wide.\nWhat need is there for jades or horses?\"*\n\nScholars who pursue learning\nvalue an inch of time over a foot of jade—\nhow much more so the ruler who embodies the Dao?\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?\nBecause it is the Dao of *wuwei* and serene stillness.\n\nSomeone asks: *\"What did the ancients mean by valuing this Dao?\"*\nDid they not say:\n*\"Seek and you shall obtain,\ncommit guilt and you shall be absolved\"*?\nThus, it is held in high regard by all under Heaven.\n\nThe subtlety of the Dao\nbegins with enlightenment within the mind and body,\nand ultimately illuminates the cosmos beyond.\nIts mysteries penetrate the formless void,\nwhile its unfolding fills the boundless expanse.\nTo embody it is to perfect oneself,\nto apply it is to benefit the world.\nThough it may not be said *\"seek and you shall obtain,\"*\nit cannot be neglected.\n\nTo obtain it without seeking is to attain it naturally.\nIf attained naturally, why need the Three Ministers at all?\nThus, it is not *\"seek and you shall obtain,\"*\nbut rather *\"seek and you shall obtain\"*—\na principle the ancients held constant.\nThose who comprehend this constant Way\nshall have no guilt to bear.\n\nIf one were to stray from the Dao and commit a fault,\nby amending one’s errors and returning to the Way of *wuwei* and serene stillness,\none may yet avoid disgrace.\nThe original text reads: *\"Did they not say 'seek and you shall obtain'?\"*\nYan Junping’s version states: *\"Obtain it without seeking.\"*\n\nThe profound mysteries of attaining the Dao\nlie in acting without action—\nthus it is called *wuwei*.\nTo do without doing,\nto act without laboring,\nto taste without indulging—\nthe Perfect One does nothing,\nyet lets things act of themselves.\nThings act of themselves, yet there is no doing without doing.\nStill, the Perfect One’s heart never stirs.\n\nTo labor without toil is to let things manage their own affairs.\nThings manage their own affairs, yet there is no labor without labor.\nStill, the Perfect One’s body never wearies.\n\nTo taste without desire is to follow the essence of things.\nThings follow their own essence, yet there is no taste without taste.\nStill, the Perfect One’s palate never craves.\n\nIf the heart remains undisturbed, clarity is boundless.\nIf the body labors not, substance is profound.\nIf the mouth desires nothing, tranquility endures.\nIf tranquility endures, vital essence flows without end.\n\nAnother interpretation of *\"taste without taste\"*:\nIt is not the speech of beauty or ugliness,\nbut the speech of the Great Dao’s flavorlessness.\nThe Classic says:\n*\"When the Dao issues from the mouth,\nits taste is faint and without flavor.\"*\n\nGreat or small, much or little—\nrewarding resentment with virtue.\nPeople say there are great and small matters in the world,\nand that human affairs range from much to little.\nThey say that all actions diminish one’s true nature\nand stray from spontaneity.\nDiminishing true nature breeds resentment,\nstraying from spontaneity spawns malice.\nResentment and malice together\nare the stages of calamity and chaos.\n\nOnly the Perfect One, with *wuwei*, *wuwei*, and *wuwei*,\ncan extinguish the heart and wither the body.\nEven if there are resentments from those who act,\nthey are all met with the Perfect One’s heartless, boundless virtue.\nSomeone asks: *\"If one has virtue, how does one repay it?\"*\nThe world’s affairs—great or small, much or little—\nits anger, resentment, kindness, and virtue—\nare all repaid with the Perfect One’s heartless, boundless virtue.\n\nLu Xisheng says:\n*\"Those who embody the Dao are profound and boundless,\nresponding to the world while rooted in *wuwei*,\nattending to affairs while rooted in *wuwei*,\ntasting without indulgence while rooted in *wuwei*.\nThough their form may be vast, their essence is simple and small.\nThough their deeds may be many, their essence is subtle and few.\nThus, they flourish in simplicity and stillness,\nunshaken by all things.\"*\n\nOnly thus can there be no desires,\nno desires mean no selfishness,\nkindness is the accumulation of selfishness,\nresentment is the seed of kindness.\nOnly the Sage can have no selfish desires,\nno selfish desires mean no selfish kindness,\nno selfish kindness means no selfish resentment.\nCommon people are not so—\nbecause they have selfish desires,\nthey have kindness and resentment.\n\nYet those under Heaven who harbor resentment,\nthe Sage repays them with virtue.\nThose who act unvirtuously,\nthe Sage cultivates them with virtue.\nThus, the people live in harmony,\nand ruler and ruled have no resentment—\nthis is what is meant.\n\nZhongni said:\n*\"To walk the Way fully under Heaven is to have no resentment.\nHow could the Sage harbor resentment toward anything?\"*\n\nPlan for difficulty when it is easy,\nact on greatness when it is small.\nDifficulty and ease, greatness and smallness—\nthese are the world’s great and small matters.\nRight and wrong, beauty and ugliness,\nresentment and anger, kindness and virtue—\nall arise from subtle beginnings.\nNone do not begin as easy and end as difficult,\nor start as small and become great.\nIf one plans at the time of ease,\nthere will be no difficulty at the end.\nIf one acts at the time of smallness,\nthere will be no greatness later.\n\nBut if one waits until difficulty arises,\nor acts when greatness is already upon them,\nresentment deepens and calamities accumulate.\nTo then seek to dissolve difficulty and untangle chaos—\nis it not difficult?",

branches and trunks have grown,\nhow can one strike them down?\n\nWhen regret and sorrow are but faint traces,\nworries and anxieties are easy to dispel.\nBut when calamity has already revealed itself,\nits disaster cannot be undone.\n\nThe original text reads: *\"its frailty is easy to judge\"* (or *\"to disperse\"*).\n**Act upon it before its emergence**—this means to **modify and remove** it beforehand.\n\nWhen a realm has not yet fallen into peril,\nand wickedness has not yet sprouted,\nif one preemptively guards against it,\nthen what misfortune could arise?\n\n**Prevent disorder before it begins.**\n*\"Prevent\"* here means **to rescue**.\n\nWhen the seeds of misfortune have not yet taken root,\nand calamity has not yet attached itself,\nif rescue comes first,\nthen no great

easy to dispel.\n\nHow does this work?\nA cart with a single wheel missing can be guided by a child.\nBut when it has overturned and toppled,\na thousand men cannot restore it.\n\nA fledgling bird,

eventually brings ruin.\n\nA tree of a thousand arms begins from a tiny sprout,\na nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth,\na journey of a thousand miles starts beneath one’s

harmony,\nthe nation prospers and thrives—\nthis is the blessing.\n\nUnderstanding these two principles,\nis to grasp the eternal model.\n\nThe two principles refer to\nemploying cleverness and not

cleverness\nis the eternal model to be followed.\n\nHe who does not employ cleverness,\npractices virtuous governance and benefits the people—\nhe is the nation’s blessing,\nleading to honor for one’s clan and glory for one’s kin.\nThis is also the eternal model\nto be followed by those who employ cleverness.\n\nThe ancient text reads *kǎishì* (稽式), *kǎi* (稽) meaning \"to examine.\"\nIt refers to examining ancient models.\n\nAlways knowing the eternal model,\nis called *Xuándé* (玄德, profound virtue).\n*Xuán* (玄) means deep, obscure.\n\nA ruler should know\nthat blessings can be entrusted to,\nand thieves can be removed,\nbringing the *Qínshǒu* (黔首, common folk) to wealth and longevity—\nthis is profound and obscure virtue indeed.\n\nProfound virtue is deep, distant, and contrary to things,\nonly then does it reach the *Dàshùn* (大顺, Great Harmony).\n\nThe *Xuándé* (玄德) of the Sage\nis deep beyond knowing,\ndistant beyond perception.\nYet when observing their words,\nthey seem to oppose the natural order of things,\nbut when examining their essence,\nthey align with the people’s path—\nonly then do they enter the realm of *Zìrán* (自然, spontaneity),\nand nothing goes against it;\nthis is called *Dàshùn* (大顺, Great Harmony).\n\nYan Junping said:\nThe discernment of foolishness and cleverness\nis without limit,\nbringing peace to the heavens and tranquility to the earth,\nlike the *Yīnfú* (阴福, hidden blessings) of the cosmos,\nunseen by the world—\nthus it is called *Xuándé* (玄德, profound virtue),\ndeep beyond measurement,\ndistant beyond reckoning,\ncontrary to things,\nand none can overcome it.\n\nThe *Liezǐ* (《列子》) says:\nEmperor Yao governed the world for fifteen years,\nand did not know whether the world was governed or not,\ndid not know whether the ten million myriads\nwished to revere him or not.\nHe asked his attendants,\nbut they did not know;\nhe asked the outer court,\nbut they did not know;\nhe asked the commoners,\nbut they did not

nobles:\n*\"This is an ancient poem.\"*\n\nYao returned to his court,\nsummoned Shun (舜),\nand passed the throne to him through abdication.\nShun did not decline and accepted it.\nThis is called profound virtue,\ndeep and distant, reaching Great Harmony.\n\nThe adept in the Dao\ndoes not act against the few,\ntheir virtue and measure are profound and distant,\nlike rivers flowing toward the sea,\nthus they are likened to the sea,\nthe king of all rivers.\n\nThe sea becomes the king of all rivers\nbecause it excels in humility—\nthus it can be the king of all rivers.\n\nThe *Kāiyuán Yùshū* (开元御疏) says:\nThe sea becomes the king of all rivers\nbecause it dwells in the lowest flow.\n\nThe *Yì* (《易》) says:\n*\"The Earth’s Dao transforms fullness into humility,\nand flows with modesty—\nthe Earth’s Dao uses humility,\nand all rivers converge and flow toward it.\nThe Sage uses humility,\nand the common folk come willingly without exhaustion.\"*\n\nYan Junping said:\nThe sea’s kingship\nis not achieved by accumulating virtue,\npiling up benevolence,\nor offering favors to win their devotion—\nnor is it through exalted rites,\nbroad deference,\nor adorned wisdom to please them—\nnor is it by employing unusual tactics,\nestablishing authority,\nor wielding force and displaying might to control them.\nInstead, it is through purity and stillness,\ndwelling in humility,\nwaiting in emptiness,\nwith no action and no desire—\nthat all rivers come naturally.\n\nThe rivers do not come because they hear\nthe sea’s beauty or are transformed by its virtue—\nnor are they bound by constraints,\nguided by coercion.\nYet they pierce through gold and stone,\ndrill into cliffs,\nsoak into mountains,\nand rush toward the sea without return—\nthis is the form conforming to nature,\nthe essence aligning with things,\nand the natural course of all phenomena.\n\nFrom this, we see\nthat humility as the Dao is vast indeed.\n\nA hundred harms cannot injure it,\nclever schemes cannot seize it.\nIt is strong without battle,\nmighty without coercion.\nSilent and without action,\nit engages in mutual exchange with all things.\n\nValleys are low,\nthus they can reach their end without exhaustion;\nthe sea dwells beneath,\nthus it can reign without ceasing.\n\nTherefore, the Sage desires to be above others,\nyet speaks with humility.\nThe Sage refers to those who embody\nthe humility of the lowest flow—\nthey who wish to stand above others\nmust first humble themselves in speech,\nknowing fullness invites loss.\nThus, they speak in humility and gentleness,\ntake the names of solitude and fewness,\nand their great virtue grows daily,\ntheir vast undertakings ever firm—\nnaturally, they are revered and elevated by all.\n\nTo lead others,\none must place oneself behind them.\nTo emerge first among all things,\none must humble oneself in body,\nand be gentle in words.\nThose who retreat behind others\nare cautious in their conduct,\nfollowing the Dao,\nnot presuming to lead—\nthus they are allowed by others to take precedence.\n\nTherefore, though they dwell above,\nothers do not feel burdened;\nthough they stand

others—\nyet the people all joyfully revere them,\nas though they were light in their governance.\nThus, the people follow willingly,\nand who could harm them?\n\nTherefore, the world delights in pushing them forward\nwithout exhaustion.\nThe ruler who follows the Dao,\neven commoners flock to them,\nas though drawn by the sun,\nor praised like clouds.\nAs lord, they are never weary—\nit is their virtue of humility and sincerity that brings this.\n\nBecause they do not contend,\nnone under heaven can contend with them.\nHumility transforms the lower,\nand the lower all become humble and retreat.\nThus, the Sage always takes emptiness as their body,\nand non-action as their heart—\nwhen heart and form are void,\nwhat can contend with them?\n\nLu Xisheng said:\nThe Dao of

      "translated_text": "Abandoning the rear for the front—this is death.\n\nYet the world today does otherwise. Those deemed \"worthy\" are in fact contrary to the Way.\n\nAll abandon *compassion* and *virtue*, seeking instead *courage* and *righteousness*, reckless with *qi* and light in death, to ensnare others—this is the extreme peril of overreaching.\n\nUnable to love and practice frugality, they instead indulge in extravagance, greedily seeking broad expenditure, plundering until resources are exhausted. They must inevitably harm finances and the people, thus inviting the calamity of scarcity.\n\nThen, they adorn themselves with cleverness to astonish the ignorant, refine their conduct to expose filth, delight in leading others, and shame being last. Advancing without humility, retreating without restraint, their actions are bold yet unchecked—this is rebellion against the sovereign.\n\nThese three ways are not the enduring arts of the Great Way; they lead only to the ruin of family and self. Hence, it is said: *this is death.*\n\nNow, *compassion*—when wielded in war, it brings victory; when held in defense, it secures strength.\n\nAmong the Three Treasures, *compassion* is most precious, hence its partial concealment as a flaw.\n\nWhen a sovereign employs *compassion*, nurturing soldiers as one’s own, they become invincible beneath heaven.\n\nFor *compassionate* armies entering enemy lands do not trample crops, dig up graves, ravage stores, or burn dwellings. Instead, people welcome them as孝子 (filial sons) behold their benevolent parents. Those who surrender come like arrows loosed into deep valleys.\n\nThus, why must battles be fought in open fields before victory is won, or defenses fortified with gates and drums? Heaven itself will aid them, shielding with *compassion*.\n\nFor Heaven’s *Dao* rewards the virtuous and punishes the licentious. The virtuous are naturally blessed by Heaven, facing no adversity.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"Heaven’s *Dao* favors none—it aids only the virtuous.\"*\n\nThus Heaven aids them because their sovereigns and generals employ *compassion* and *virtue* to protect soldiers and people.\n\nThe Great Way seems unworthy, yet *compassion* and frugality appear unmartial—hence the next step: *the virtuous warrior is unmartial.*\n\nThe *virtuous warrior*—one who embodies *compassion* and *virtue*, punishes tyranny, relieves suffering, yet does not oppress the weak with brute force.\n\nThe skilled warrior does not rage in battle.\nFor those who master the battlefield, though armed, use force only when unavoidable. In confronting the enemy, they do not delight in slaughter. They treat war with the solemnity of mourning rites—how could they revel in anger and war?\n\nThe skilled victor does not contend.\nFor the skilled victor, triumph lies in *virtue*, not conflict. Armies conquer through harmony; harmony brings victory. They do not act from self-interest but follow the *Dao* to seize opportunity.\n\nLike Zhu Zhonglian’s whistling or Xiong Yiliang’s ball-playing—these are the ways of the skilled victor.\n\nThe skilled ruler serves beneath others.\nThe skilled ruler employs humility, not force; delights in guiding the people, who forget their labor. Thus, using ministers as advisors, they are like limbs to the body; employing generals, they are obeyed with reverence, their chariots led by the sovereign’s hand. They lead with *virtue* before demanding strength.\n\nThis is the *virtue* of non-contention, the *virtue* of harnessing others’ strength, the *virtue* of aligning with Heaven—ancient perfection.\n\nThose who excel as warriors, in battle, in victory, and in ruling—ever gentle, non-contending, humble in self-cultivation—exhaust the world’s potential and fully employ all. Is this not the *virtue* of non-contention, the strength of others?\n\nIf they lead with harmony, we respond in kind—like Heaven’s boundless grace arising from no favor, or the seasons moving without command. Thus they align with Heaven, governing in its place—this is the ultimate of ancient *Dao*.\n\nThe *virtue* of non-contention is the law of warfare, hence the next step: *the principles of warfare.*\n\n**Principles of Warfare:**\nLaozi lamented that the world’s armies take delight in war, so ancient military strategies are cited to warn against this.\n\nI dare not be the aggressor, only the defender;\nI dare not advance an inch, only retreat a foot.\n\nWarfare’s aggressor is the attacker; the defender responds. The Sage’s army acts only when forced, thus always responding—always the defender.\n\nAdvancing little, retreating much—this is the art of deep strategy against superior foes.\n\nThough enemies come, I rely on *Dao* rather than formation, thus avoiding conflict.\n\nAgain, the laws of deploying troops: the aggressor schemes through mobilization; the defender focuses on response. Though advances are few, they edge toward annihilation; though retreats are many, they turn toward survival. Thus, one must not dare to be the aggressor but the defender, not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot—just as courage in daring leads to slaughter, while courage in restraint brings life.\n\nThis is called:\n*\"Marching without marching,\nRepelling without arms,\nConfronting without enemies,\nWielding without weapons.\"*\n\nFor the purpose of warfare is to halt the enemy, valuing non-contention. Though halting them, one harbors no intent to kill.\n\nSince there is no killing intent, my army merely upholds *righteousness* in defense—thus *\"marching without marching.\"*\n\nAgain, if generals must raise arms to charge first, it is as if they have no arms to raise—such is their aversion to killing and reverence for *compassion.*\n\nEven if a tyrannical aggressor stirs rebellion, I respond with *cultural virtue* and display *righteous* armies. They will retreat upon hearing *righteousness*, naturally leaving no enemy. Though the threat of retaliation remains, there is no enemy to retaliate against—hence *\"confronting without enemies.\"*\n\nWith the enemy withdrawn, arms are sheathed. Though the ritual of bearing weapons remains, there are no weapons to wield—hence *\"wielding without weapons.\"*\n\nNo greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy—underestimating the enemy risks losing one’s *Treasure.*\n\n*Treasure* refers to life and position.\n\nUnderestimating the enemy means delighting in external warfare while neglecting internal defenses. Delighting in external warfare may yield victory or defeat, but neglecting internal defenses ensures ruin.\n\nThough the Sage rules supreme beneath heaven, considering the times of order and chaos, enemies are many.",

If forced to confront an enemy, it is not my true intent. Since it is not my true intent, it is already a loss. Though the loss is not yet great, it is *\"near to losing.\"*\n\nThus, when armies clash, the first to strike is victorious.\n*\"Ant\"* (抗) means *\"to raise.\"* When two states raise their armies against each other, the side that acts first prevails.\n\n*\"Pity\"* (哀) is the expression of sincere mercy from the heart, arising from the ruler’s virtue. If the ruler retains a merciful heart, does not neglect the rites of governance, and the ministers below fulfill their loyalty, exhausting their duty to serve—then where can they fail to triumph?\n\nWarfare warns against underestimating the enemy, but its words are easily understood. Therefore, I follow with my own teachings, which are even easier to understand and even easier to practice.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Act without action.\"*\n*\"Know the world without leaving your door; know the Way without looking through a window.\"*\n*\"Practice the teaching of the unsaid.\"*\n\nAll these are the Way of *Wuwei*—simple and effortless within its proper scope. Though the words are not elaborate and the practice requires no labor, they are easy to know and easy to do.\n\nYet none under heaven can know them, none can practice them.\n\nThose who cannot know them are the lesser scholars. The lesser scholars delight in petty disputes, cling to superficial arguments, and are easily confused by *having-for-nothing* (有为). They favor attacking heterodox views, unable to purge their minds, still their thoughts, or guard the One. They remain in darkness, unaware of the Way of *Wu*—vague and unable to act.\n\nThere is a principle in speech, a master in affairs. This explains why the easy-to-know and easy-to-do is so seldom attained.\n\n*\"Principle\"* (宗) is the root, the sovereign. Though the hundred schools speak in different ways, they all converge on *li* (理, principle). Those who grasp *li* forget the words, so the ultimate principle of speech is *not-speaking*.\n\nAll affairs, though diverse in their paths, ultimately unite in *achievement*. When achievement is complete, the affairs are abandoned—thus, the master of affairs is *non-action*.\n\nThis is teaching through *non-speech* and *non-action*—how could it not be easy to know and easy to do?\n\nYan Junping said:\nThe Sage’s words root in *naturalness*, ancestral in *divine clarity*. They dwell in the inversion between speech and silence, subtle and wondrous, returning to *naturalness*. Their clarity is as if unseen, their hearing as if unheard—open yet seemingly blocked, penetrating yet seemingly exhausted. Their practice begins in *naturalness*, flows into the divine, and dwells in harmony between *action* and *inaction*. Pure, still, yielding, and weak, their movements are delicate and refined, simple and retiring, returning to *Wuwei*.\n\nOnly because they are without knowledge are they unknown to others.\n\nThe lesser scholars, blind in their ignorance, delight in parsing words and lost in debates over *solid-white* and *same-different*. Hearing the Dao of *non-speech* and *non-action*, they scoff and laugh in disbelief, deeming my Way great yet calling it unworthy.\n\nYan Junping said:\nIt is not that my Way is small or unworthy of knowledge, nor that my affairs are trivial or unworthy of action. Nor is it that the world delights in ruin, hates completion, loves calamity, and shuns rest—refusing to follow me.\n\nHuman nature opposes mine, desires conflict with mine. The wise are ensnared by desires, drowning in what they hear their whole lives, their *qi* and spirit unsettled, their hearts and intentions misaligned.\n\nFew know me, thus I am honored.\n\nThe words of the ultimate Dao have a principle and a master—only the enlightened know them, hence their rarity and sparseness.\n\nThose who attain this Dao are honored by all things, hence it is said, *\"those who follow me are honored.\"*\n\nThe *Kaiyuan* edition reads: *\"those who follow my Way are honored.\"*\n\nYan Junping said:\nThus, their clarity is not seen, their hearing not heard. Deep words return to receive slander, great deeds retreat to earn blame. The lone-seer’s clarity is useless in the world, the lone-hearer’s wisdom brings shame among the people. Those who align with divine clarity do not conform to convention, those whose achievements match the heavens and earth do not please the masses.\n\nThus, the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\n*\"Coarse cloth\"* (褐) is the garment of the lowly. Jade is pure and moist, likened to the virtue of the gentleman.\n\nThe Sage internally treasures virtue and power—this is likened to harboring jade. Externally, he lacks ornamentation—this is likened to wearing coarse cloth.\n\nThus, though his inner brilliance is vast, his outer appearance seems foolish and dim. Pearls are hidden in oysters, jade nestled in stone—none under heaven can know it, hence my Way is honored.\n\nSince common folk presumptuously claim to know the Sage’s hidden knowledge, I follow with *\"knowing the unknown.\"*\n\n*\"Knowing the unknown\"* is virtue’s height.\n*\"Not knowing the known\"* is a flaw.\n\nThe Sage, pure in *qi* and refined in nature, internally harbors true knowledge. All things are spontaneously understood, yet though capable of knowing, he does not boast in it—this is the highest virtue.\n\nThe middle and lesser scholars, coarse in *qi* and stubborn in nature, internally brimming with cunning, yet in their affairs they are arrogant and ignorant. Though they do not truly know, they forcefully argue, embellishing their words to feign knowledge—this is the flaw of virtue.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The unknown is profound; the known is shallow. The unknown is within; the known is without. This is what is called: ‘The knower does not speak; the speaker does not know.’\"*\n\nOnly because of the sickness of sickness is there no sickness.\n\nThe Sage’s true knowledge and wondrous root penetrate the dim and obscure, thus he possesses the six penetrations and four openings, transcending above and below without fixed form. Tranquil and without burden, he yet constantly suffers.",

At this time, virtue and power cannot save, Heaven and Earth cannot resolve—this is not Heaven’s fault.\"*\n\nThose who are high and secure, bearing the fear yet wielding power, forget care and lose fear, seeking nothing from themselves.\n\nThus, those who care for their own bodies do not fear others, those who fear themselves are not controlled by others, those who are cautious in small matters do not dread great ones, and those who restrain themselves near do not regret their distance.\n\nDo not defile where you dwell.\n*Ancient reading*: \"狎\" (*xiá*), meaning \"habitual.\"\n*Where you dwell*: refers to one’s conduct.\nThe cautious and fearful must choose good neighbors, avoid corrupt companions, maintain purity in self-guarding, and hold themselves in humility—then calamity cannot touch them. Their bodies remain whole, their spirits sovereign; this is the depth of fear and caution.\n\nDo not narrow where you dwell.\n*Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary*: \"狭\" (*xiá*), meaning to broaden one’s dwelling, not to forcefully confine oneself. It lies in harmonizing light and accommodating all, not clashing with things.\n\n*Ancient reading*: \"The dwelling of the spirit is the heart.\"\nMan should forget emotions and abandon desires, softening his breast to let the spirit’s chambers rest, so that the spirit may dwell in the heart—then life is preserved.\n\nDo not corrupt where you are born.\n*Ancient reading*: \"驮\" (*tuó*), meaning \"evil.\"\nThe form given by the Dao is what is meant by \"where you are born.\"\nMan should not corrupt the evil of his Dao; he should serve diligently, revere the great, fear the Dao and fear Heaven—then he can eternally preserve his primordial blessing.\n\nIf he indulges his desires, corrupts his Dao, and despises virtue, calamity will follow swiftly.\n\n*Ancient reading*: \"The spirit born from the body.\"\nMan lives through the spirit; \"where you are born\" refers to the spirit.\nThe spirit, clear and luminous, prefers emptiness and stillness. If man washes his heart and calms his thoughts, the spirit returns of itself.\nIf he indulges in desires and debases his spirit, scheming to indulge his nature, then the spirit’s *qi* scatters and dissipates, and life is lost.\n\nThus, he is exhorted to not corrupt the spirit he was born with, to preserve the enduring Dao.\n\nOnly because one does not resist, is one not silent.\n\nOnly those who fear the Dao and fear Heaven are singularly precise and unified. In haste or leisure, they adhere to this principle—how could they have a heart for evil or laziness? Thus, the Dao’s hidden blessings descend upon them, granting a hundred auspicious signs. This is why they mutually cherish and protect, never exposing evil.\n\n*Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary*: \"Singularly precise and unified\" are words from *The Book of Documents—Great Yu’s Model* (《尚书·大禹谟》), where Shun commands Yu to take his place.\n\nMan’s heart is fraught with peril, the Dao’s heart is subtle—peril makes it hard to rest, subtlety makes it hard to discern. Only through singular precision and unity can one steadfastly grasp its center.\n\nThus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself.\nThe Sage first preserves within himself, then within others. Examining his own heart’s origin, he knows his own virtues and vices.\nThrough cleansing and purging, he ensures no dust or filth enters his gates—this is called self-knowledge.\nHaving understood the Dao’s profound silence, he acts with movement day and night, not boasting of his talents or abilities, nor being confused by things, fearing to deviate from principle or act improperly—like those who do not fear the greatest fear.\n\nHe loves himself but does not exalt himself.\nThe Sage cherishes his own body, knowing it is the Dao’s creation. He does not indulge his appetites, nor does he wallow in evil and idleness, harming the utmost principle or diminishing his form and spirit—this is called self-love.\nIf one instead covets rich flavors and fine clothes, indulges in beauty and music, finds comfort in his nature, and delights his ears and eyes, exalting himself while despising others—this is defiling where he dwells and failing to maintain purity and stillness. How could this be one who fears and is cautious in the minutest matters?\n\nThus, he abandons that and takes this.\nIf one abandons the arrogant self-exaltation and takes the fear of the greatest fear—obtaining the principle of revering the Dao and serving Heaven without growing weary of others—then external punishments fade, and life’s Dao is internally sufficient.\n\nHe does not do evil for the sake of doing evil, nor seek courage for the sake of killing—\n*Daoist True Classic: Treasury of Virtue and Power, Chapter Nine, \"Perfection of the Dao\"*\n*Daoist True Classic: Treasury of Virtue and Power, Chapter Ten, \"Refinement of the Dao\"*",

those who act with wickedness, it returns calamities of misfortune.\nIn its power over human affairs—life and death’s decree,\nThe patterns of *xiàngwěi* and celestial movements—\nIt never falters, never fails.\nIs this not the wisdom of the Great Planner?\n\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and wide,\nThough sparse, it never lets slip.\nStretched across the boundless void, it is called the Heavenly Net.\nIts breadth and expanse are called *huánghuáng*—this is *liàn*.\nIts reach into darkness and light, with no escape, is called *bù shī*.\nThus, the bold are slain,\nYet the common folk do not fear death—\nHence, the saying: *\"the common folk do not fear death.\"*\n\nFor there are two meanings to \"not fearing death\":\nThe enlightened know its natural order and do not fear it.\nThe foolish lose sight of its natural order and yet do not fear it.\n\nBy Heaven’s nature, humans are born in stillness,\nYet delight in life and dread death—this is human nature.\nThey till the fields and eat,\nThey weave and wear,\nThey rest in their dwellings,\nThey take joy in their labors,\nThey nurture the living and bury the dead—\nThese are the customs of the world.\n\nWhen the people abide by their natural ways,\nAnd officials uphold their proper laws,\nWithout wrong or excess,\nThey meet their natural deaths.\nIf the people’s lives and deaths follow their natural course,\nThen why should they fear it?\n\nBut when virtue declines,\nAnd rulers cannot refrain from action,\nTheir nets and laws become dense and strict,\nThe people barely survive.\nTheft and deceit arise,\nThey cheat the hungry and sow chaos.\nThe small fear trembles within them,\nThe great fear paralyzes them,\nAnd they forget death.\nHow can severe punishments and cruel officials\nInstill terror in the common folk?\nThe ancient text reads: *\"How can one make the people fear death?\"*\n\nIf the people were to fear death,\nAnd yet still commit crimes,\nI would seize and execute them—\nWho would dare?\n\nFor fear of death also has two meanings:\nThose who cherish life and act with caution\nFear Heaven’s judgment and seek virtue.\nThose who commit evil and crave ease\nFear punishment and feign obedience to the law.\n\nMoreover, by nature, humans\nAbandon their burdens and walk freely,\nOr lie at ease, drumming their bellies in leisure.\nLost in confusion, they know not of aging’s approach—\nThese are the people who follow the natural order.\n\nNow, with laws and decrees multiplying,\nEvery movement risks death,\nThus the people are made to fear death.\nWhen the people fear death,\nThey cling to life’s fleeting comforts,\nAnd nurture treacherous, deceitful schemes\nTo evade the laws.\nWhen deceit flourishes and calamities arise,\nThe officials seize and slaughter,\nSevering the roots of evil—\nWho would dare transgress?\n\nThe natural order executes those who execute.\nHe Shang Gong says:\n*\"Those who execute\"* refer to Heaven’s high and distant gaze,\nJudging the sins of those below.\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and wide—\nIt speaks of Heaven’s clear discernment, nothing unseen.\nWhy need there be harsh punishments and strict laws?\n\nDu Guangting says:\n*\"Those who execute\"* are the sovereign’s agents,\nGreat in nurturing life and loving the people.\nIn the *Nan Gong Dan Lu* scrolls, rewards are given for virtue,\nAnd in the *Bei Guan Hei Lu* records, crimes are punished.\nHeaven and Earth, with all their gods,\nOversee the deeds of good and evil,\nTo chastise and encourage,\nSo that evil may be abandoned and virtue cultivated.\nThus, those with merit are granted longevity,\nThose with guilt have their years cut short,\nNo fraction lost—\nLike the *Yángguān* officials in their meticulous reckoning.\nHeaven has the *Sì Sī* stars that govern fate,\nPositioned between *Xū* and *Wēi*,\nOverseeing merit, demerit, lifespan—\nThis is Heaven’s execution of judgment.\nIt examines crimes and blessings obliquely,\nSo that all may know to cultivate virtue and avoid evil.\n\nThe ruler teaches with virtue,\nAnd moves with compassion and forgiveness.\nAs for those who do not act virtuously,\nHeaven’s executioners will slay them themselves.\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and forgiving,\nThough sparse, it does not let slip.\nTo defy Heaven and reverse the Dao—\nWhere can one flee punishment?\n\nTo execute in Heaven’s place\nIs like a clumsy carpenter taking the master’s tools.\nTo execute in Heaven’s place,\nTo wield judgment and rely solely on punishments,\nTo usurp the authority of *Zàohuà* over life and death—\nThis is like a clumsy man replacing a skilled artisan.\n\nTo take the master’s tools,\nFew are those who do not harm their hands.\nTo replace a master artisan with a clumsy one,\nNot only will the wood be ruined and the work spoiled,\nBut also hands will be injured and fingers broken.\nThis illustrates how rulers,\nBy usurping *Zàohuà*’s authority over life and death,\nAnd recklessly applying their laws and punishments,\nNot only harm the common folk,\nBut also sever the harmonious *héqì*.\n\nFor Heaven’s Dao is high and bright,\nWhile human understanding is narrow and dim.\nTo have a ruler with limited wisdom\nUsurp the place of Heaven’s boundless clarity,\nAnd mislead the people in their natural order—\nThis is to lose the governance of nature.\n\nThe people do not fear death,\nBut only hunger.\nHence, the next phrase: *\"the people’s hunger.\"*\nThe people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxes—\nThus they starve.\n\nThe people are the foundation of the state.\nWhen governance is burdensome, taxes grow heavy,\nAnd the people’s poverty weakens the state’s roots.\nTherefore, the ruler depends on the people for sustenance,\nAnd the people rely on the ruler for stability.\nIf taxes are taken in excess, both ruler and people starve.\nIf the people are stripped bare while the ruler grows rich,\nBoth suffer ruin.\n\nDu Guangting says:\n*\"The laws and decrees

When the people are well-provided, the state flourishes; when they are impoverished, the state is in peril. The principle lies in moderation—laws should not be too harsh. Thus, when rulers cast penal codes with severity, they provoke resentment; when they impose burdensome levies, the land grows poor. The Marquis of Qi (*Qī Hóu*) perished through excessive demands, while the Duke of Tian (*Tián Shì*) became a hegemon through generous grants. Let the enlightened ruler take heed of these lessons.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because their rulers act excessively—thus they are difficult to govern. Excessive action leads to burdensome governance; non-action brings simplicity. Simplicity is easy to follow, while complexity is hard to govern. When the ruler indulges in fine jade and lavish meals, the common folk delight in coarse grains and husks. Strict nets of law and harsh decrees make governance difficult. The people grow indifferent to death because their pursuit of life is so desperate—thus they become reckless with death. When governance is oppressive, taxes and levies are heavy, and the people lose their means of livelihood, they then transgress laws and break prohibitions, readily facing death. This is because their desperate search for sustenance leads them to disregard danger, even to wade through water and fire without fear or to confront blades without hesitation—hence, they are said to treat death lightly.\n\nOnly those who do not cling to life are truly wiser than those who do. Those who greedily chase life and profit are like sheep running to the slaughter, hastening their own demise. Yet there are those who outwardly forget life’s concerns: they endure hardship without humiliation, eat humble fare yet find it sweet, and though the world’s affairs may be tumultuous, they remain tranquil and at ease. This is how they differ from those who cling to life.\n\nClinging to life is both a blessing and a curse—it nourishes life, yet also becomes a self-inflicted burden. Those who value life excessively are driven by bodily comfort, craving for rich flavors, fine garments, and pleasing colors; they seek harmonious sounds, and if denied, they grow anxious and fearful, even to the point of blaming others and recklessly inviting death. When the people are hungry, their spirits scatter and they grow indifferent to death; when they are well-fed, their bodies and minds are whole and they cherish life—thus the next phrase: *\"the people’s life is soft and frail.\"*\n\nThe people’s life is soft and frail, yet their death is firm and resolute. When alive, the people absorb the *yuánhé* Dao’s *qi* and embrace the *zhēnyī* essence’s vitality, their bodies and spirits whole—thus their limbs are soft and frail. But when they die, the *yuánhé* *qi* disperses, the *zhēnyī* essence is exhausted, their forms decay and their spirits vanish—thus their limbs become firm and rigid.\n\nAll things, grasses and woods alike, are soft and pliable when alive, yet dry and brittle when dead. When alive, they are nourished by the *qi* of heaven and earth flowing within, and by the *yīnyáng* fluids moistening without—thus their spring shoots are tender and can be bound, their summer leaves flourish and can be woven, a display of their softness. When they die, the *qi* of heaven and earth dissipates within, and the *yīnyáng* fluids wither without—thus their autumn fruits turn crimson and fall, their winter branches wither and can be snapped, a sign of their brittleness.\n\nThe ancient sage understood this principle well—this is the act of the ruthless. The ruthless see life and death as mere gathering and scattering of *qi*. The enlightened understand life and death as the preservation or loss of Dao. Thus, the firm and resolute are the followers of death, while the soft and frail are the followers of life.\n\nThe *Kāiyuán* commentary states: *\"Grasses and woods are soft and pliable when alive, firm and brittle when dead. Thus, for those who act with firmness and rigidity, they are the followers of death; for those who act with softness and frailty, they are the followers of life.\"*\n\nYán Jūn Píng said: *\"Where the yang *qi* resides, even wood can be woven and grass can be bound. Where the yang *qi* departs, water can freeze and ice can shatter. Thus, the enlightened yang *qi* is the root of life, and softness and frailty are the medicine for all things. Softness and frailty are the means of gentle growth, while the enlightened yang *qi* is what sustains them. All things follow the yang *qi* in their softness and frailty, so the firm and rigid are the true likeness of death, while the soft and pliable are the true likeness of life. Hence, when armies are strong, they cannot prevail.\"*\n\nYù Zhēn said: *\"War is an instrument of violence and a tool of conflict, a realm where one encounters the enemy in battle. When armies are strong, the ruler becomes complacent while the generals grow arrogant; when generals are arrogant, the soldiers grow reckless. A complacent ruler faces arrogant generals, while arrogant generals confront reckless soldiers—defeat is inevitable before victory can even be pursued. Thus, Jié and Zhòu, despite their armies of a million each, were overthrown across the four seas; Qīn Shǐhuáng, despite his unified empire, lost all nine regions; Xiàng Yǔ rose as hegemon yet perished swiftly; Wáng Mǎng usurped the throne and was destroyed in turn. Fú Jiān met disaster at the Huái River, while Suí Yáng was shattered at the Chu Palace—these rulers all commanded armies numbering in the tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, yet none could rely on their strength to secure victory. These are clear proofs that strong armies do not prevail.\"*\n\nMoreover, conquering the enemy is not difficult; maintaining victory is the challenge. Only the ruler who follows the Dao can hold onto victory. The defeats of these past rulers all stemmed from their inability to maintain victory.\n\nWood is strong in its trunk and roots, yet its branches and leaves are soft and pliable, bearing fruit above. The *Kāiyuán* commentary states: *\"Wood is inherently strong and sturdy, so its roots and trunk remain firm and low, while its branches and leaves, soft and weak, bear fruit above. This is because the soft and pliable are positioned above, while the strong and rigid remain below.\"*\n\nThe strong and sturdy are at the base, while the soft and pliable are above. Wood’s strong trunk and roots always reside below, its soft branches and tender leaves always above. If wood behaves thus, how much more so for humans, for nations! When the vital *qi* of life persists, the people are soft and frail—this is the Dao of humility. Heaven’s Dao favors humility, hence the next phrase: *\"the Dao of Heaven.\"*\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow. The *Kāiyuán* commentary states: *\"Heaven’s Dao is vast and lofty; no analogy can clarify it better than the method of drawing a bow, which reveals Heaven’s virtue in action. The high must be lowered, the low must be raised; the excessive must be diminished, the deficient must be supplemented.\"* The *Kāiyuán* commentary further explains: *\"The bow’s purpose is to combine materials and set its form, ensuring that its slackness and tension are balanced, its high and low adjusted—this is the standard for shooting arrows.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Adjusting the excessive and supplementing the deficient is for determining the distance of the shot—whether the arrow will hit its mark or fall short. Thus, it achieves its target, and the discussion returns to the Dao of Heaven. The *Yì* [《易》] states: *\"The Dao of Heaven is established in the interplay of yin and yang. Yang governs ascent, yin governs descent; when yang ascends to its utmost in Heaven, it descends; when yin descends to its utmost in Earth, it ascends. This is the symbol of restraining the high and elevating the low, as in drawing a bow.\"* The yin-yang cycles of Heaven’s Dao—seven interludes of fullness and emptiness—adjust the excess of the day and supplement the deficiency of the moon. The sun’s heat and moon’s chill, one advancing and one retreating, thus complete the year’s work.\n\nA wise ruler should follow Heaven’s Dao: restraining the strong and aiding the weak, diminishing excess and augmenting deficiency. Hence, the emphasis on *kuī* [亏, deficiency] and *yíng* [盈, fullness], on *jiàn* [谦, humility], to ensure that all measures are balanced and applied with fairness.\n\nYán Jūn Píng [严君平] remarked: *\"When craftsmen make a bow, they ensure neither over-tightness nor slackness, neither excessive compression nor tension. They shape it with compass and square, guide it with plumb line. If the string is too high and taut, they loosen and relax it; if too low and slack, they gather and raise it. Where there is excess, they trim and diminish; where there is deficiency, they reinforce and add. The string’s tension and the bow’s body harmonize, the upper and lower parts balance, equanimity as their core, accord as their norm—thus the bow can measure weight and the arrow can fly true.\"* To restrain the high and elevate the low, to diminish the great and augment the small, is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven’s Dao supplements the deficient and diminishes the excessive, but human affairs do the opposite: diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive. The *Kāiyuán* commentary [开元御疏] states: *\"This clarifies that human affairs cannot match Heaven’s Dao of augmentation and diminution, but instead favor the many at the expense of the few.\"* In the *Yì* [《易》], when one *kuī* [亏, diminishes] the lower and augments the upper, it is called *kuī* [损]. When one diminishes the upper and augments the lower, it is called *yì* [益], and the lower is taken as the foundation. Diminishing the lower while augmenting the upper—its Dao proceeds upward—thus in the *Tài* hexagram [泰卦], when one diminishes the lower and augments the upper, the transformation yields *kuī* [损]. Diminishing the upper while augmenting the lower—the people rejoice without bound—thus in the *Pǐ* hexagram [否卦], when one diminishes the upper and augments the lower, the transformation yields *yì* [益]. This is the method by which the Sage established the hexagrams and observed their symbols.\n\nWho, then, could withhold excess to serve all under Heaven? Even those who claim to follow the Dao.\n\nThis is a rhetorical question, elaborating its meaning. The question asks: *\"Who can align with Heaven’s Dao of descending to aid the people, sacrificing their own excess of rank and wealth to provide for the poor and needy of all under Heaven?\"* The answer states: *\"Only the Daoist sage, the virtuous ruler, and the wise philosopher can do so.\"* The term *\"deliver\"* [奉] emphasizes that the Sage-ruler, though elevated, never forgets the lowly—just as the humble serve the exalted without claiming superiority. Thus, the Sage acts without arrogance, achieves without clinging, and does not desire to be called virtuous.\n\nThe Sage is *yuán tōng* [圆通, omniscient and adaptable], using the Way as wisdom and adapting to circumstances as their heart. They order all things without claiming righteousness, nourish all ages without claiming benevolence, endure from ancient times without claiming longevity, and shape the myriad forms of existence without claiming cleverness. How could they boast of their own deeds, pride themselves on their virtues, or, upon completing their work, insist on retaining their position? Only by not clinging and not claiming can they lead the humble like the master of the *wéi* [韦, coarse] materials.\n\nHeaven’s Dao augments the few and diminishes the excess, restraining the high and elevating the low—only the Daoist sage can embody this principle of humility. Hence, the next point: *\"Under Heaven, nothing is as soft and weak as water.\"* Though water is the softest and weakest of all things, it can overcome the hardest and strongest—nothing can replace it. Among all things under Heaven, water is the most soft and weak, yet it pierces metal and stone, conquering the hard and strong with no rival.\n\nAgain, consider humanity: water can be blocked by dams, directed by channels, contained by dikes, and diverted by obstacles—high, low, perilous, or muddy, it flows in countless ways. Yet because of its soft and weak nature, it remains unaltered in its essence. Thus, softness overcomes hardness, and weakness overcomes strength—all under Heaven know this, yet few can practice it. Everyone knows that water extinguishes fire, yin subdues yang, the tongue is soft yet preserves, while the teeth are hard yet break—these are common truths. Yet people follow their own desires and cannot embody the Dao of softness and weakness. Hence, Lǎozi [老子] sighed deeply, and he cited the Sage’s words to illustrate the practice of softness and weakness.\n\nTherefore, the Sage said: *\"To bear the defilement of the state is to be called the Lord of the Soil and Grain.\"* The Sage’s words—whether the remnants of the *Sān Bēn* [三坟] or Lǎozi’s humble phrasing—teach that a ruler can accept the blame of the state, taking upon themselves all the faults of the people. If one person bears the guilt, the myriad cannot be burdened, then the people will look up in admiration and not scatter. Thus, they can perpetually serve the Soil and Grain as their sovereign.\n\nThe *Hóng Liè Jiě* [《鸿烈解》] recounts: *\"When Jin attacked Chu, the army did not advance despite three withdrawals. The officials urged the king to strike. King Zhuang [庄王] said: 'In my father’s time, Jin did not attack Chu. Now, in my reign, Jin attacks Chu—this is my fault. How can I bring shame upon the state?' Wèi Dàfū [韦大夫] replied: 'In my father’s time, Jin did not attack Chu. Now, in my reign, Jin attacks Chu—this is my fault. I beg the king to strike.' The king wept bitterly, his tears flowing like rain, then ascended and bowed to Wèi Dàfū. When the people of Jin heard this, they said: 'The ruler and his minister both claim the fault as their own, and the king even humbles himself before his subject—we cannot attack such a state.' That night, they retreated and returned home.\"* This is an example of *\"bearing the defilement of the state\"*—the first instance of *\"the Lord of the Soil and Grain.\"*\n\nWhen founding a state, emperors and kings place the ancestral temple on the left and the Soil and Grain altar on the right. The ancestral temple honors the ancestors and aligns with Heaven; the Soil and Grain altar honors agriculture and the harvest. The *bèi* [备] and *qì* [弃] hexagrams [卦] signify the abundance that sustains the people’s livelihood—food is the foundation of life. Since food is essential to humanity, a state must first establish its Soil and Grain altar, and the ruler must serve as its guardian.\n\nTo bear the defilement of the state is to be called the *\"King of All Under Heaven.\"* If a ruler can practice humility and softness, bearing the state’s ills without complaint, then all under Heaven will return to benevolence, and the six directions will rest in harmony—they are the *\"King of All Under Heaven.\"* The commentary states: *\"Mountains and rivers accept filth, and so too should a ruler bear defilement.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「The *Hóngliè Jiě* [《鸿烈解》] states: During the time of Duke Jing of Song [宋景公], the wandering star [荧惑] was in the constellation of the Heart [心], and the Duke, fearful, summoned Zi Wei [子韦] and asked: *\"What does the wandering star in the Heart portend?\"*\n\nZi Wei replied: *\"The wandering star is a Heavenly punishment [天罚]. The Heart is the Song realm’s celestial division [宋分野]. The calamity will soon fall upon the ruler. Though it may be transferred to the prime minister [宰相], such a deed would be inauspicious.\"*\n\nThe Duke said: *\"The prime minister governs the state [治国家], and transferring death to him would be unpropitious.\"*\n\nZi Wei replied: *\"It may be transferred to the people [民].\"*\n\nThe Duke said: *\"If the people die, who will serve as my subjects?\"*\n\nZi Wei replied: *\"It may be transferred to the year [岁].\"*\n\nThe Duke said: *\"The year is the people’s life [民之命]. If the year brings famine, the people will surely perish. As a ruler, to kill the people to save myself—who would still recognize me as their sovereign?\"*\n\n*\"My fate is already sealed,\"* the Duke declared, *\"do not speak further.\"*\n\nZi Wei bowed twice and said: *\"I dare congratulate you, my lord. Heaven is exalted yet hears the lowly, and you have spoken words befitting a ruler [君人之言]. Three times you have borne this punishment, and three times the wandering star will shift its course. Tonight it will move three stages [三舍], each stage seven *lǐ* [里], and thus your life will be extended by twenty-one years. I beg leave to lie in wait beneath your throne this very evening to observe it.\"*\n\nIndeed, the star shifted three stages that night.\n\nThis is the *\"bearing the state’s ills\"* [受国不祥], the *\"King of All Under Heaven\"* [天下王].\n\nWords are reversed in meaning.\n\nHe who practices **softness and weakness** [柔弱] may become a ruler [君主], but he who relies on **rigidity and strength** [刚强] will invite disaster.\n\nThe **Sage** [圣人] bears defilement and evil, yet eternally preserves the **Great Auspiciousness** [元吉].\nThe common folk delight in beauty and honor, yet ultimately meet ruin.\n\n*\"Bearing the state’s ills\"* [受国不祥] aligns with the **Way** [道], yet the people’s hearts remain unfulfilled. Thus, it follows with *\"harmonizing great grudges\"* [和大怨].\nTo harmonize great grudges is to leave lingering grudges behind.\n\nIf a ruler cannot govern with **effortless humility** [无为谦弱], the people will grow greedy and contentious, leading to reckless youths who block the roads [道卫], their arms raised in defiance. Then the ruler must establish teachings and laws to restrain them—*those who kill shall die, those who wound shall be punished*.\n\nTo respond to grudges with harmony is to turn their resentment into greater resentment. It is better to have no grudges than to have grudges and yet respond with harmony.\n\nTo know only how to harmonize great grudges, yet not understand how these grudges arise in the first place—even if one responds with utmost fairness [至公], lingering grudges will remain.\nThis is like a carpenter’s apprentice [大匠] cutting wood; few will escape harming their hands.\n\nBut if one responds with **heartless virtue** [无心至德], it is nearly as if one were creating the world anew.\nHow then can one speak of goodness?\n\nThe **Sage and Worthies** [圣贤] originally used punishment and governance to harmonize grudges and evil, yet how can one speak of goodness when deceit and treachery only grow worse, and resentment and longing increase?\n\nThus the **Sage** holds the **left token** [左契], yet does not blame the people.\n\nLü Xīshēng [陆希声] said: *\"In ancient times, people tied knots for agreements, yet none deceived; when they split wood for tokens, none violated them. This was because the Sage had no fixed intentions of his own—he took the people’s hearts as his own.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s heart and the people’s hearts were as inseparable as the **left and right tokens** [左右契].\nWhen tokens were presented, they were united in trust, and the Sage did not blame the people. Thus, ruler and subject grew close, and grudges never took root.\n\nLǐ Róng [李荣] said: *\"In ancient times, the Sage carved wooden tokens—rulers held the left, ministers the right—and united them as a pledge of trust. No further laws were needed, so the Sage did not blame the people. If he did not blame them, how could grudges arise?\"*\n\nThus, the **virtuous** [有德] held tokens to ensure **harmony** [契], while the **unvirtuous** [无德] held the **right tokens** [彻].\n**彻** [彻] means **permeation** [通], the **Way** [道].\n**司** [司] means **to govern** [主].\nThe **virtuous** refers to rulers of the **Middle Ages** [中古], who had no written laws, only carved tokens and matching symbols as pledges of trust. The people followed of their own accord, so they were called **virtuous**.\n\nThe **unvirtuous** refers to rulers of the **Far Antiquity** [远古], whose virtue was so vast it had no name. All things followed their natural course—dwelling in caves, nesting in trees, each content in its place. Their rulers had no schemes or thoughts; they appeared alone at dawn, and this was not considered neglect. Their virtue was profound and their Way mysterious—no tokens were needed for governance, only to ensure **permeation** [通彻] was upheld. Thus they were called **unvirtuous**.\n\nThis is the saying of Du Guāngtíng [杜光庭].\nThe old saying held that **彻** [彻] meant **traces** [迹], or that it meant **establishing norms** [作轨]. But if laws are enforced to guide the people, they will bring exhaustion and decay—hence the term **unvirtuous**.\n\nNow, **permeation** [通] is the more enduring interpretation.\n\nHeaven’s **Way** [道] has no favorites—it aligns with those who are good.\nHeaven’s **Way** has no bias—it bestows itself only upon the good, as the saying goes: *\"The Heavenly net is vast and wide, though its mesh seems sparse, yet nothing escapes.\"* [天网恢恢，疏而不失]\n\nThus, those who practice **great goodness** [上善] naturally find their ways in accord.\nWhy would they need tokens or laws to blame the people?\n\nThis is the **Way** of the **Far Antiquity** [太古] once more.\n\nTo harmonize grudges is to leave grudges unresolved; to **cease grudges** [息怨] is to govern with **non-action** [无为].\nTo govern with **non-action** is to dwell in **smallness** [小] yet not covet, hence it follows with *\"small state, few people\"* [小国寡民].\n\nIn a **small state with few people**, even if they possess **tenfold or hundredfold tools** [什伯之器], they will not use them.\n**什** [什] means **five** [伍], **伯** [伯] means **long** [长], and **器** [器] refers to **materials and tools** [材器].\n\nA small state can defend itself; few people can sustain themselves.\nThis is the return to the **Far Antiquity** [太古].\n\nLet the people have **units of five and ten** [部曲什伯], and command them to respect their ranks without encroaching upon one another.\nBecause the ruler governs with **non-action**, the people’s livelihoods flourish, and their materials and tools become grand and wondrous, yet unused.\nThis is the **ultimate governance** [至治].\n\nLet the people **cherish life** [重死] and **not wander far** [不远徙].\nIf a ruler governs with **non-action**, his **virtue and transformation** [德化] will be pure.\nIf the people are simple and unadorned, they will not lightly court death—**rooted in their origins** [崇本], they will **abandon superficiality** [弃末].\nThey till the fields and weave cloth, each clinging to their ancestral homes and not straying.\nEven the **Xuanhuang** [轩皇] and **Jiǔ** [几蘧] of old could not surpass this governance.\n\nThough **boats and carriages** [舟舆] exist, they are unused.\n*Wooden boats are hollowed to cross water*—this is for distant travel.\nYet this is for distant travel.\nNow, for rulers who uphold the **Way**, in large states they seek only to **shelter the people** [兼畜人], in small states they seek only to **have the people serve them** [入事人].\nThey do not encroach upon one another, nor do they engage in trade.\nThough they possess boats and **straight paths** [直], they abandon them and do not use them.\n\nZhuāngzǐ [庄子] said: *\"In the age of **Great Virtue** [至德], mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes had no boats or bridges. All things thrived in their natural state—this was the **Way** of their homeland.\"*\n\nThough **armor and weapons** [甲兵] existed, they were never employed.\nWeapons were originally set up to **punish treacherous ministers** [讨逆臣] and **ward off bandits** [御乱寇].」",

      "translated_text": "「When the ruler acts with **non-action** [無為], the subjects observe their duties, the people do not stray, and the four borders remain at peace—then **armor and weapons** [甲兵] are not needed.\n\nLet the people return to the use of **knotted cords** [結繩] for record-keeping.\nThe *Commentary on the Changes* [《系辞》] states: *\"In the ancient times, knotted cords were used to govern affairs; later, the sages replaced them with writing and inscriptions.\"*\nIn the age of knotted cords, all were pure and simple.\nOnce writing was introduced, deceit and falsehood grew daily.\nNow, to restore the people to their original simplicity and purity,\nthe ruler must make them return to the use of knotted cords.\n\nLet their food be simple yet satisfying,\ntheir clothing plain yet comfortable,\ntheir dwellings humble yet secure,\nand their customs joyful yet unadorned.\nWhen the ruler above has no desires, the people below naturally become simple.\nIf their tastes are not indulged, the people will know contentment.\nEven coarse vegetables and plain broth will fill their bellies with sweetness,\nwhile hemp garments and deer-hide cloaks will keep them warm without finery.\nReed huts and wattle-and-daub walls will shield them from wind and rain,\nand the torrid southern heat or the bitter northern cold will be endured with ease.\nThus, their customs remain unspoiled by artificiality,\nand their land is free from pestilence and disease.\n\nNeighboring states may be in sight,\nand the sounds of roosters and dogs may be heard across borders—\nyet the people live out their lives without ever visiting one another.\nNeighboring states in sight means the territories are contiguous.\nRoosters and dogs heard nearby means the people are plentiful and the lands close.\nThe people live until old age without ever facing enemies—\nthis is to say they are free from war and die of natural causes.\nTheir lack of interaction is like fish forgetting each other in rivers and lakes,\nor people forgetting each other in the **Dao/Way** and its arts—\nthis is the harmony of the **Huxu and Lu tribes** [赫胥尊、卢氏] of ancient times.\n\nWhen the people know contentment, their words are sincere yet unadorned,\nso next comes the principle: *\"Sincere speech is not beautiful.\"*\nSincere speech is plain and without flavor—like water.\nWater’s plainness allows it to endure;\nits lack of adornment is its natural quality.\nBeautiful speech is sweet and overindulgent—like fine wine.\nSweetness makes it fleeting;\nits lack of sincerity lies in its excess.\nThe **good** [善] do not argue,\nwhile the argumentative are not **good**.\nThe **good** value inner virtue and noble action,\nwhile those who do not argue return to their original simplicity.\nThe eloquent value persuasion,\nwhile the unvirtuous are mired in right and wrong.\nThe wise are not learned in many things,\nwhile the learned are not truly wise.\nThe wise understand the **Dao/Way**—\nthey grasp principles and roots,\nseizing only what is essential.\nWhy need they be learned in many things?\nThis is called **\"sufficiency\"** [少則得].\nThe *Sutra of the Western Ascension* [《西升经》] says:\n*\"He who attains the One fulfills all things,\nand without clinging, the spirits and gods submit.\"*\n\nThe learned are those who exhaustively study varied doctrines,\nseeking only to prove their own views.\nThe unwise are those who accumulate knowledge only to be confused by it.\nZhuāngzǐ [庄子] said: *\"When **virtue/power** [质] is lost to **learning** [文], and **learning** is pursued to excess, the mind drowns in partial truths.\"*\n\nThe sages do not hoard.\nHaving given to others, they grow ever more abundant;\nhaving bestowed upon others, they grow ever wealthier.\nHoarding means storing and accumulating.\nThe sages’ **Dao/Way** benefits all under heaven,\nyet they do not hoard **virtue/power** [德] to elevate themselves.\nThey accumulate yet also scatter,\nnor do they store wealth to enrich themselves.\nThey neither delay their works externally\nnor gather their wisdom internally—\nboth are harmonized, hence they are called **\"non-hoarding\"** [不積].\nZhuāngzǐ [庄子] said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** of Heaven flows without accumulation,\nthus all things flourish.\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **Sage Emperor** [帝道] flows without accumulation,\nthus all under heaven is united.\nThe **Dao/Way** of the sages flows without accumulation,\nthus all within the seas submit.\"*\n\nThe sages do not hoard because\nthey manifest **moral virtue** [道德] for the people.\nThe people receive their benefits, and the sages’ **virtue/power** [德] becomes ever clearer—\nlike a **weight of gold** [镒] illuminating others without concealing its own goodness or ill-will,\nyet its brilliance never diminishes.\nThis is the metaphor for inner wisdom.\n\nThey distribute wealth to the poor,\nand the poor, receiving their bounty, find their abundance ever greater—\nlike a well that endures constant drawing,\nbenefiting all without depletion,\nyet its waters remain pure and inexhaustible.\nThis is the analogy for external works.\n\nThe opening chapter of the upper section\nclarifies that the **Dao/Way** is the fundamental teaching,\nand its body aligns perfectly with its subtlety.\n\nThe closing chapter of the upper section\nexpounds that **non-action** [無為] is **non-inaction** [無不為],\nrevealing the essence of the teaching,\nand its application suits the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThus, the form and use are both forgotten,\nand the beginning and end are seamlessly connected.\n\nThe opening chapter of the lower section\nexplains that **\"having virtue/power\" [有德] and \"lacking virtue/power\" [無德]** are the responses to teaching,\nfollowing the **Way**’s purification and refinement of the times.\n\nThe closing chapter of the lower section\nuses the contrast of *\"sincere speech\"* [信言] and *\"insincere speech\"* [不信言]\nto demonstrate the teaching’s application,\nallowing things to manifest naturally as adorned or plain,\nand thus conforming to the **Dao/Way**.\n\nTherefore, by adapting to the times and allowing things to unfold naturally—\nwithout opposing or contending—\nit is to uphold their original **virtue/power** [元德]\nand to align with **Creation** [造化],\nto restore the **Dao/Way**’s constancy\nand enter its **mysterious gate** [妙门].\n\nThe *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* [《道德真经》] concludes the tenth scroll of the *Cherished Obscurity* [藏室慕微] section.»",
