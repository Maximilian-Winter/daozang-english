In his youth, he studied for the imperial examinations but was exiled to the military registers of Lingnan due to a criminal offense. During the Zhiping era, my late grandfather, the *Longtu* Duke Shen, served as military commissioner of Guilin and recruited Zhang to his staff to manage confidential affairs. When the Duke was transferred to other posts, Zhang followed him. After the Duke passed away in Chengdu, Zhang wandered through Qin and Long, and eventually served Ma Mo of Fufeng in Hedong. When Ma was summoned to the capital, Zhang entrusted this book to him before his departure, saying: \"All I have learned in my life is contained herein. I hope you will circulate it, for there may be those who, upon reading it, will grasp its meaning.\"\n\nMa later became Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, and Zhang Lutan of Nanyang served as Registrar of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. Lutan said: \"I am the son-in-law of the *Longtu* Duke.\" Believing Lutan could comprehend his teachings, Ma transmitted the book to him. Lutan, in turn, passed it to my late father, the *Baowen* Duke. At the time, I was but a child, yet I secretly took and read it, though I could not comprehend it.\n\nWhen my father served as military commissioner of Qin, Wang Zhen, a minister of Yangping, was in his staff. Wang mentioned that his elder brother, Master Chongxi, had studied the Dao and, having encountered Liu Haichan, obtained the art of the Golden Elixir. Chongxi remarked that no Daoist in the world could fathom this teaching except Zhang Pingshu. The difficulty of attaining the Dao, he said, was such that only those of great power could succeed. Chongxi later journeyed to Luoyang to visit the wealthy Han Gong, relying on his assistance to complete his work.\n\nAt the time, I was young and full of vigor; though I heard his words, I paid them little heed and did not inquire who this \"Pingshu\" might be. In recent years, as my vitality has waned with age, I have gradually turned to the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi for self-cultivation. Someone transmitted to me the art of the Golden Elixir, saying: \"The spirit is the essence of life; the body is the abode of the spirit. The Dao preserves the spirit; the art secures the body. When the spirit is whole and the body firm, one may come and go at will.\"\n\nAfter divining an auspicious day and taking vows, the transmission was completed. The master then said to me: \"The Great Return Elixir of Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Golden Fluid is a secret treasured by the highest sages and must not be lightly disclosed. In the future, when you meet those to whom you wish to transmit it, first adhere to the sworn covenant, then require them to cultivate it themselves. Only after they have achieved success may you carefully select and entrust it to them. This is to ensure that you first experience the process yourself before instructing later disciples, so that when they engage in the work of withdrawal and augmentation, they may avoid peril. Thus, the Dao of perfecting both form and spirit will be made manifest. From ancient times to the present, all transmissions have followed this pact; those who violate it will surely incur heavenly retribution. Do you not know that Pingshu, having transmitted to unworthy recipients, suffered three calamities? You must exert yourself and take heed.\"\n\nHe further recounted the origins of his transmission, stating that he had received it from an extraordinary person in Chengdu—could this not have been Haichan? Moreover, Chongxi’s account of the difficulty of completing the elixir, and his assertion that none of the so-called Daoists of the world were worthy of approval except Pingshu alone, aligned perfectly with what I had once heard from Zhen. Thereupon, I took up this book and read it, finally awakening to its meaning. I also examined the transmitted works of Master Lü’s *Qinyuan Chun* and Haichan’s poems and lyrics, finding not a single word that did not resonate with it. Thus, I knew that its source and lineage were well-founded.\n\nToday, many enthusiasts collect this work, yet the texts vary considerably in wording and structure. I suspect that when it was first composed, it had not yet been refined, and copies had already begun to circulate. I have compared and corrected over twenty discrepancies, the most egregious being a verse that originally read:\n*\"No sooner do you see the sprout appear than you must swiftly gather it;*\n*If you encounter the distant full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\"*\nThis was later amended to:\n*\"When lead sees the *gui* phase arise, you must swiftly gather it;*\n*If gold encounters the waxing moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\"*\nThis revision completes the elixir formula, making it evident that the transmitted versions were imperfect in their phrasing and intent.\n\nAnother variant includes a quatrain titled *\"Awakening to Reality as Such,\"* which I have replaced with the analogy of Ou Ye forging a sword. Zhang Pingshu himself wrote in the *Postscript to the Awakening to Reality*: \"The verses in this *Awakening to Reality* sing of the Great Elixir, the ingredients, the firing times, and the subtle secrets—nothing is left unaddressed. By studying them, one may follow the text to grasp the meaning. Without these poems, how could one fathom the wonders of transmuting metal and wood? The writing is concise yet the principles profound; thus, I have composed this work to bring the matter to completion. Only then can the intent of returning metal and wood to their original state be brilliantly deduced. Once the Great Elixir is achieved, the Sacred Embryo may be formed.\"\n\nScholars should know that while this book has been widely transmitted, only my family’s version is authentic, for it was personally entrusted by Pingshu himself. Though I have received it, my capacity is insufficient; I must seek like-minded companions to bring it to fruition. This is why I entrust it to you.\n\nThe Yin Way spurns the nine-and-one,\nDefiling the primordial womb with chaos.\nThe arts are myriad,\nA thousand paths, ten thousand more.\n\nMaster Peng says: The world does not comprehend the fundamental origin of the Great Dao, and thus all are but side doors and crooked paths. These belong to many kinds, all deviant ways. They violate heavenly principle, disrupt the utmost truth, openly defy the words of the Yellow Emperor, and wholly lose the intent of the Old Master. What was meant to grant eternal life instead harms one’s existence.\n\nElder Zhongli says: The meaning of \"the gate that gives me life is the door that takes it\"—how profound! The loftiest sages have spoken of it, yet none below can bear the burden. Why? Simply because the world clings to self in cultivation, and thus the thousand paths and hundred byways are nothing but side doors.\n\nThe Immortal Elder, in compassion, spoke plainly of seeking the very source of life’s origin—was this not revealing too much of heaven’s mechanism? For mortals come from the realm of karmic consciousness and depart through it as well. The solitary yang flees and is lost; though the form is male, the body is all yin. If one clings to the self in cultivation, how can one return to the origin and revert to the root? Unable to return to the origin and revert to the root, how then can one reverse yang and transform the bones?\n\nThus, those of great practice seek primordial true lead and must seek it from the very place where one first received qi and took form. Only then can the primordial true unity of qi be obtained, to return to the origin and revert to the root. Such is the way for men and women in cultivation.\n\nFor women who cultivate immortality, the breasts are where the qi of life resides, and the method is even simpler. Thus, men cultivate immortality by refining qi, while women cultivate immortality by refining form. Women first accumulate qi in the breasts, then set the cauldron and establish the furnace, practicing the Great Yin method of refining form. This path is most easily accomplished, for it holds wondrous principles.\n\nIn the Xuanhe era, Lü Dongbin traveled to Wuxing and encountered a courtesan named Zhang Zhennu. Though her beauty was radiant and her bearing graceful, her nature favored simplicity. Though fallen into the wind and dust, each evening she bathed, changed clothes, lit incense at the stove, and prayed to heaven, earnestly seeking liberation. Dongbin, disguised as a scholar, visited her. When Zhennu saw him, his bearing was extraordinary, and she deeply revered him.\n\nTheir joy spent, the scholar drifted away. The next day he returned, and again it was the same. For over a month this continued, yet he never once crossed the bounds of propriety.\n\nZhang Zhennu said, “You have graced me with your favor for so long, yet you never stay the night to share the pleasures of pillow and mat. Could it be that I, coarse and flawed, am unworthy of your company?”\n\nThe scholar replied, “Not so. What is precious is the meeting of hearts—why must it be otherwise? Moreover, each night you pray to heaven. What is it you truly seek?”\n\nZhennu said, “Having lost myself to this life, what else could I do? Yet I reflect: since entering this gate, I have recklessly applied powder and rouge, passing falsehood for truth, singing wanton songs, turning sorrow into mirth. I am but a sack of foul pus, using artifice to deceive others. Each time I regret how foolish men fail to honor their own worth—passing my door, they see me as a flower, their hearts ensnared, their wills entangled, unable to let go. Not only do they squander their wealth, many even lose their lives. Though I feign delight in these encounters, I feel the weight of my sin. That is why I pray morning and night, seeking early release from this gate.”\n\nThe scholar said, “What is your aspiration? Why not cultivate the Dao?”\n\nZhennu replied, “Trapped in this place, where would I find a teacher?”\n\nThe scholar said, “I could be your teacher.”\n\nZhennu immediately bowed and kowtowed. The scholar said, “Come again, and then it may be so.” With that, he left.\n\nDay and night, Zhennu awaited his return, filled with remorse. She wrote:\n\n*Met my teacher so long ago,\nYet not a word of truth he’d show.\nHow I long to sit once more,\nRegretting time now lost before,\nTill now, my heart is wracked with woe.*\n\nBefore she could finish, the scholar suddenly appeared. Seeing what she had written, he continued the verse:\n\n*The Dao holds no clever art,\nBut here’s the method, take this part.\nSit still from midnight till noon’s light,\nLet qi rise past spine’s twin gates,\nThrough Kunlun’s peak—its path takes flight.\nWhen you feel its strength arise,\nThink of me, and realize.*\n\nOverjoyed, Zhennu received from him the Great Yin method of refining form and the Great Elixir technique. From then on, her spirit and qi flourished, as if a great awakening had dawned. She knew not how much more was secretly transmitted, nor did she ever speak of it to others.\n\nAt their parting, she composed *Stepping into the Toad Palace*:\n\n*Kan and Li, Kun and Dui divide the Zi and Wu,\nFirst recognize your own ancestral root.\nThe thunder shakes the mountain, rain descends,\nTo wash and nurture the yellow sprout from earth’s embrace.\nSeize the golden essence, bind it fast,\nDistinguish jia and geng—let dragon and tiger rise.\nWhen asked who taught you this way,\nSay only: the master’s surname is Lü.*\n\nOnly then did Zhennu realize that Lü had first examined her practice before entrusting her with the teachings. Gold and jade heaped together must not be shared, nor even with one’s closest kin. For careless leaks and reckless disclosures bring calamity upon the body, misfortune upon nine generations, disaster upon the household, and ill fortune upon descendants. Nor is this all—one may suffer myriad karmic retributions, sinking into the nine hells, forever barred from rebirth. Guard this warning well; do not neglect it.\n\nWritten with reverence by Sun Xueshi on the Mid-Autumn Day of the fifth year of the Qiandao era, the year *yichou*. ¹\n\n---\n¹ *Note in the original text: “This passage contains errors.”—Lu Ziye’s preface to the* Awakening to Reality.\n\nThe upright practitioner who follows perverse methods—\nall perverse methods return to uprightness.\nThe perverse practitioner who follows upright methods—\nall upright methods turn to perversity.\n\nAlas! The Great Way of the Golden Elixir is broadly thus:\nshould one err by the breadth of a hair,\nthe loss extends a thousand miles.\n\nThis Way is the Way of one yin and one yang.\nAttain this Way, and my life rests in my own hands;\na body arises beyond the body,\nand one’s years equal Heaven’s.\nYet the common folk use it daily without knowing,\nall flowing into the snares of emotion, falsity, and the craving for taste.\n\nThings do not come to life without yin and yang—\nwhy? Because only when yin and yang unite do they arise.\nThe difference lies merely between becoming human and becoming immortal.\nThis is what the immortal masters mean by “reversal as the mother of the Elixir, compliance as the way of man.”\n\nThe method is utterly simple and easy.\nIf ordinary men and worldly folk believe and practice it,\nthey may attain the state of immortals—\nhow much more so the superior person?\n\nThe Elixir scriptures, handed down to save later generations,\noften employ metaphors in their discourse,\nrather than cutting straight to the point.\nThis is not out of secrecy or stinginess,\nbut for fear that people, lacking sufficient faith,\nwould instead slander and revile them.\n\nThis Way is unassailable and can transcend birth and death.\nAs the *Upper Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* states:\n“A lodestone attracts iron—\nthough barriers lie between, its power penetrates unseen.\nHow much more so when the myriad things unite in harmony to give life?”\n\nThe *Triplex Unity* says:\n“Things lacking yin and yang violate Heaven and forsake the Origin.\nWhen a hen hatches her own egg, the chick is incomplete.”\n\nScholars must discern the intent of the immortal masters in this.\nYet what, after all, is there to say?\n\nFrom youth, I have devoted myself in secret to this Way for many years.\nThe Way does not betray one.\nHeaven, in its compassion, allowed me to encounter a sagely teacher.\nWith a single word, I came to know:\nthe wondrous lies right before one’s eyes.\nComparing it with the Elixir scriptures, all became luminously clear.\n\nExamining what is produced within this body,\nnothing is other than mercury.\nYet in the arena of the six desires and seven emotions,\nin the realm of drunken life and dreamlike death,\nit is easily lost—\njust as mercury’s nature is hard to subdue.\n\nWithout true lead to restrain it,\nto cause their union and form the sacred embryo,\none will see spring turn to autumn, morning to evening,\nday after day, wearing away until nearly exhausted.\nWhen the four great elements cease to function—\nis this not grievous?\n\nThis work’s verses say:\n*Do not exert clever falsity as effort—*\n*Recognize the other household’s deathless method.*\n*In the flask, swiftly add the wine that extends life;*\n*In the crucible, gather the nectar that restores the soul.*\n\nAnd again:\n*Know that the door of death is the door of life;*\n*Do not cling to the gate of life as the gate of death.*\n*If you grasp the mechanism of killing and understand reversal,*\n*You will see that harm contains the grace of life.*\n\nThe essentials of elixir-making can be seen in these two poems—\neight or nine parts of their depths are revealed therein.\n\nHow worthy is the True Man of Purple Yang in his intent!\nYet how lamentable that people prefer the false to the true,\nmissing it even when it stands before them—\nwho would acknowledge it? Alas!\n\nHaving received but a single formula from my teacher,\nI have come to roughly understand the threads of this tradition.\nThere is no other Way to surpass it.\nYet what is difficult is this:\nmy strength is meager, my resolve weak—\nI cannot put it into practice.\n\nI have observed that the ancient *Master Embracing Simplicity*,\nhaving attained this Way for twenty years,\nlacked even a peck of grain in his household\nand could not practice it,\nonly sighing repeatedly—\nthese words are truly lamentable.\n\nThis Way precisely involves both knowledge and practice,\nwhich cannot be spoken of as equal.\n\nLong ago, the True Man of Dark Forest transmitted the Way to Chan Master Daoguang,\ncharging him thus:\n“Hasten to a bustling metropolis,\nseek out one with power,\nand only then may you accomplish it.”\n\nLater, Chan Master Daoguang followed the instruction to the letter:\nhe cast off his monastic robes, donned a scholar’s cap and gown,\nand returned to lay life to fulfill the task.\nExamining and verifying this,\nthere can be no doubt.\n\nThough I am not without shame,\nI presume to append a humble annotation to this book based on my foolish understanding.\nThough the language is rough,\nthe meaning is deeply intimate.\nIf by chance a worthy and enlightened fellow practitioner\nsees this and suddenly awakens to this wondrous Way,\nhow would it differ from my own attainment?\n\nBut if there are those of base perception,\nshallow in root and cold in capacity,\nlong sunk in the mire of names and appearances,\nwho rashly misappropriate and slander it,\nreducing it to the techniques of the Three Peaks and bedroom arts—\nsuch is like Confucius having no choice but to weep for the qilin,\nor Bian He no choice but to weep for the jade.\nAlas! May the ancestral masters in their divine clarity bear witness.\n\n*Preface to the* Awakening to Reality *by Master Shangyang*\n\nForm is perfected by the Way;\nlife is extended by technique.\nThese words fully encompass the teachings of the Golden Elixir.\n\nThe Old Immortal of Southern Florescence said:\n“Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes;\npeople forget one another in the Way and its arts.”\n\nLaozi said:\n“Supreme virtue acts without contrivance and without purpose;\ninferior virtue acts with contrivance and with purpose.”\n\nSupreme virtue is the unwaning inner elixir—\nthus one perfects form through the Way.\nInferior virtue is the application of the outer elixir—\nthus one extends life through technique.\n\nIf one seeks to become a Heavenly Immortal,\none must cultivate both inner and outer.\n\nWhat is the Way?\nIt is like governing a state.\nWhen the world is at great peace and the nation is without trouble,\nthis is the Way of the sage’s supreme virtue—\nenacting transformation through non-action.\nThough there be wise ministers and good generals,\nthey have no use.\n\nWhat is technique?\nWhen the world is in turmoil,\nwar and conscription arise repeatedly—\nwithout wise ministers and good generals,\nhow could mediocre men bring order?\n\nIt is like the human body:\nat birth, spirit and qi are perfectly whole.\nIf one nurtures it further with the Way,\nthe lifespan of Peng Zu would not be considered excessive—\nthis is the person of supreme virtue.\n\nBut if, in the prime of life, qi is vigorous\nand desire grows alongside it,\nwithout the protection of the outer elixir,\nhow can life be extended?\n\nThose who deeply understand this Way\ntake the Way as the essence and technique as the function.\nUsing technique to perfect the Way\nis like relying on wise ministers to pacify the state.\n\nYet what I call technique is no petty skill—\nit is the Way of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang,\nthe creative process of ceaseless generation.\n\nFollowing it gives rise to things and people—\nthis is the Way of post-Heaven.\nReversing it gives rise to immortals and buddhas—\nthis is the Way of the pre-Heaven Golden Elixir.\nThis is what is meant by technique.\n\nThus, the successive sages transmitted their teachings by first mastering technique to supplement the Way. Fu Xi, the Zhou, and Confucius all practiced the *Yi*’s technique. Hence it is said: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.” Confucius said: “Be prudent in this technique, and you shall never err.” The Buddha taught: “The Dharma is the Dharma—technique is the means.” Thus, the *Huayan Helun* states: “All skillful techniques enhance wisdom and compassion,” while the profound Way is called the technique of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. This is to say that the Yellow Emperor and Laozi both attained the Dao through this method. The Three Teachings are one family, truly without two Ways.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* of Tiantai and Master Ziyang, with its poems, lyrics, and songs, clearly reveals the technique of the Golden Elixir to fulfill the Way of enduring vision. Thus, the Master’s preface states: “The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, pitying humanity’s greed and attachment, employed the technique of cultivating life to follow their desires, gradually guiding them.” Ziye’s preface also says: “When a proper person practices an improper method, the improper method wholly reverts to correctness.” These all deeply grasp the essential meaning. In application, it is essence, qi, and spirit; in name, it is the Golden Elixir. Though its secrets are fully disclosed, the world has no one who understands. Moreover, the commentaries of Master Daoguang and Immortal Lu are exceedingly clear, yet people still fail to fathom the workings of yin and yang’s creative process—this is utterly inexcusable. External schools mistakenly label it as a side door, and some even slander it as the teachings of the Three Peaks’ sexual arts—how lamentable!\n\nThere are three reasons the Dao does not spread: First, those of superior roots and vessels, if they do not meet a true teacher, fall into emptiness and reckless abandon. Second, those of middling capacity, foolishly clinging to no teacher, wildly conjecture and guess. Third, the ignorant masses, drifting with the current, do not believe the Dao exists. Take Ye Wenshu, Yuan Gongfu, and their ilk—arbitrarily interpreting and annotating, citing immortal classics and ancient words to support their claims, yet failing to distinguish jade from stone—what benefit is there?\n\nWhen I first heard the teachings of Master Zhao, I dared not be complacent. Later, receiving the secret formula from the Old Immortal of Qingcheng, I understood the principle that yin and yang’s creative process, when followed, gives rise to humans, and when reversed, gives rise to immortals. No further debate was needed. As for the mysteries of the moon’s emergence, the birth of yang at geng, the subtleties of fire times, and the Qingcheng instructions—these are the most precise and easily practiced. Now, I dare not keep them secret. The few lines appended to each chapter of the *Wuzhen Pian* are the remaining insights of Xue and Lu, further elucidated to prevent later learners from entangling themselves in webs of doubt.\n\nAlas! Those in the world who believe in the Dao and practice it are rare indeed. The Way of the Golden Elixir has never been as intimate and urgent as in this *Wuzhen Pian*. Above, there are the direct transmissions of Pure Yang and Hai Chan; my own teachers, Chongyang and Danyang, and the words of the old immortals also align with this. Moreover, the successive transmissions of Xinglin, Daoguang, Niwan, and Ziqing all attained the immortal Dao through this. Though even a three-foot child knows the world possesses the technique of divine immortals, people of this age slander and revile it—how thoughtless they are!\n\nThe Old Man of Qingcheng transmitted to me the true formula and later instructed: “There will surely be kings and nobles who seek you as their teacher. The Dao cannot be hoarded in secrecy, nor can it be recklessly divulged. Who can discern this? I have a method of verification, quite reliable in revealing the truth. I now pass it to you—you may sift the sand to extract the gold.” Receiving my teacher’s transmission, I was as if startled in sleep and waking. First, I taught Marquis Tian. Later, Master Zhiyang traveled through Yelang, Kou Shui, Yuan Zhi, Chen Yang, Jingnan, the two E regions, Changsha, Lu Fu, and the lands east and west of the Jiang, teaching over a hundred people—all with the essential teaching of preserving the body through the Dao. As for the secret of extending life through technique, I could speak of it to barely two or three in a hundred. This is not my presumption—it is a matter of their capacity.\n\nI record this here to urge those who hear the Dao to each strive diligently. How wondrous! Though one may possess a pair of large jades to precede a team of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing in this Dao.\n\n**Purport to the *Wuzhen Pian* by Master Ziyang**\n\nThe utmost essential in learning immortality is this: even the world’s most foolish person, if they obtain the wondrous formula, may ascend to sagehood. Why? Because they firmly believe without doubt and act with courage. Learners who do not receive the true teacher’s oral transmission retreat in bewilderment. Otherwise, they wildly speculate, discoursing on nature, destiny, Chan, and the school—flaunting their dry wisdom. Who knows that this book contains an absolute verse:\n\n*Though you comprehend the true nature of Suchness,*\n*You must still cast off the body and re-enter the body.*\n*How much better to also cultivate the Great Medicine,*\n*And swiftly transcend to the untainted, becoming a true person!*\n\nThus, the Three Teachings, though their paths differ, all first comprehend nature and then cultivate life. There has never been one who knows how to cultivate life yet does not comprehend nature. For the Great Medicine enters through nature—only then is it the Golden Elixir. Those who know only nature—how can they grasp the wondrous workings of the Mysterious Female giving birth to the Elixir? Many in the world awaken to nature yet do not know how to cultivate life, hence the verse: “They are called the Four Fruits’ futile ones.” This clarifies that awakening to empty nature does not attain the supreme teaching of Bodhidharma. Later fools, however, claim that only after cultivating life does one seek to comprehend nature—how deceptive and deluded! What can be done?\n\nMoreover, in recent times, there are reckless people who falsely compose songs and eulogies, appending them to this book to blind the study of nature and life. Such works as the *Duzu Yingji* and *Ducantong Qi*, along with over forty Chan school songs, are filled with coarse and vulgar language—how can these illuminate nature? These are the doings of ignorant beginners, reciting them in unison like those on the same bed—such unfathomable words only deceive and confuse the world. I have now excised them all, lest they defile the profound text.\n\nThese people do not study Master Ziyang’s book, yet speak of fathoming the wondrous Dao, their words leaking the workings of transformation. Their intent is quite different, but their words are most urgent.\n\nAs in the lines: *\"First take heaven and earth as the crucible and vessel, / Then gather the sun and moon as the elixir to refine.\"* Or again: *\"When lead meets gui, the two substances converge at the appointed time.\"* Such lofty and wondrous expressions—how could they be fathomed by those of base and defiled perception?\n\nThus the True Man’s own preface states: *\"Though the teachings divide into three, the Dao ultimately returns to one.\"* Yet how lamentable that later generations of the yellow-robed and black-clad, each clinging to their own sect, mutually denounce one another, causing the essential principles of the three schools to be lost in deviant byways, unable to merge and return to unity.\n\nIn my earlier years at the Ministry of Works, I harbored doubts on this matter, suspecting that immortality and Buddhism followed separate paths, and that nature and life were distinct pursuits. Later, by my teacher’s instruction, I was shown the way home and came to know that there is no principle of two Daos under heaven. Without the master’s guidance, all is but deceptive talk.\n\nHaving perused numerous texts and made exhaustive inquiries, I find that the *Wuzhen Pian* has garnered over thirty commentaries before and after. Among them, some have practiced diligently and gained deep insight; some have attained thorough understanding but not put it into action; some have entered the gate but lack the requisite \"fire-phase\"; some grasp the outline but know not where to begin; and some, without a true teacher, have presumptuously annotated the text, grossly misconstruing its intent. As the True Man said: *\"Scholars interpret according to their capacity, naturally forming the three vehicles’ distinctions.\"*\n\nNow, I have compiled the commentaries of Xue, Lu, and Chen, and had them printed for circulation. Their meanings converge, their purport is one—truly a ladder for later learners. As for the book’s origins, several accounts exist, each later exponent narrating their own version. The circumstances of its transmission are unreliable; some claim it was secretly bestowed by the Three Stars of the Wall, others that burning the author’s mortal remains yielded hundreds or thousands of śarīra—all fabrications, not to be credited.\n\nMen of discernment may judge these words for themselves. Follow them in practice, and both immortality and Buddhahood may be realized.\n\nWritten by Zhang Shihong, Minister of Works.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Wuzhen Pian***\n\nAlas! The human body is hard to obtain, yet time slips away with ease. Unaware of life’s brevity, how can one escape karmic retribution? Failing to awaken in time, one merely resigns to fate and awaits death. Should a single thought err at the final hour, one may fall into the three evil destinies, drifting for kalpas without hope of emergence. At such a moment, though one may repent, what use is it?\n\nThus the elders of Daoism and Buddhism opened the gate of expedient means through the study of nature and life, teaching people to cultivate the seed of liberation and escape the cycle of birth and death. Buddhism takes emptiness and quiescence as its essence; if one awakens suddenly and attains perfect penetration, one transcends directly to the other shore. Yet if residual habits remain, one still clings to existence. Daoism takes refinement and nurturance as truth; if one grasps its essential pivot, one ascends immediately to sagehood. Yet without clarity of original nature, one remains bound to the illusory form.\n\nNext, the *Book of Changes* contains phrases on exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining destiny; the *Analects of Lu* expounds the admonition to *\"have no preconceptions, no predeterminations, no obstinacy, no ego.\"* Here, Confucius plumbed the profound mysteries of nature and life. Yet why are his words often brief and lacking in detail? It is because his aim was to order human relationships and propagate the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and music. Thus, he did not openly speak of the Dao of non-action, but embedded its techniques within the images of the *Changes* and concealed its principles within subtle words.\n\nAs for Zhuangzi, who probed the fetters of things to reveal the nature of carefree wandering, and Mencius, who excelled in nurturing the flood-like qi—both came close to the mark. Later, Wei Boyang of the Han drew upon the *Changes* and the Dao of yin-yang’s union to compose the *Cantong Qi*, elucidating the workings of the Great Elixir. In the Tang, the Venerable Zhong of the Loyalty School prefaced his recorded sayings with the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi to illuminate the root and branches of the supreme Dao.\n\nIs this not proof that *\"though the teachings divide into three, the Dao ultimately returns to one\"*? Yet how lamentable that later generations of the yellow-robed and black-clad, each clinging to their own sect, mutually denounce one another, causing the essential principles of the three schools to be lost in deviant byways, unable to merge and return to unity.\n\nMoreover, people today believe that the Daoist tradition values the cultivation of life-destiny, yet they fail to recognize that the methods of cultivating life-destiny arise from two distinct paths: one is easily encountered but difficult to accomplish, while the other is difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish.\n\nFor instance, refining the qi of the Five Sprouts, absorbing the light of the Seven Luminaries, visualizing and massaging, inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid, reciting scriptures and mantras, sprinkling water and chanting talismans, clicking teeth to gather spirits, abandoning wives and fasting, concentrating the mind between the brows to replenish the brain and return essence, or practicing bedchamber arts—along with ingesting and refining minerals, metals, herbs, and plants—all belong to the category of methods that are easily encountered but difficult to accomplish. The above practices, though part of the path of self-cultivation, are largely fragmentary and flawed. Thus, despite great effort, no verifiable effects are attained. If one diligently applies oneself with unwavering resolve, day and night, these methods may at best ward off illness and prevent untimely misfortune. Yet should one cease practice, all prior efforts gradually dissipate. This merely prolongs the years without ensuring success. To hope for a single attainment that endures, to return to infancy and reverse aging, to transform and ascend in flight—is this not exceedingly difficult? Truly, it is a cause for deep sorrow.\n\nMost modern practitioners, deluded and attached, fail to awaken to the truth of the wondrous method and instead blame the immortals for deceit. Little do they know that those who attain the Dao all do so through the refinement of the Golden Elixir, yet fearing the revelation of celestial secrets, they veil their teachings under various pretexts. Among these methods, only breath-holding—if one can forget all scheming and still all thoughts—bears some resemblance to the seated meditation of the Two Vehicles. If practiced diligently, it may lead to samadhi and spirit departure. Yet since spirit belongs to yin and the bodily abode is hard to stabilize, one must perpetually employ shifting methods. Without grasping the Way of returning mercury and lead, how can one reverse yang, transform the bones, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight?\n\nThe refinement of the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, however, is difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish. It requires a thorough understanding of yin and yang and a deep mastery of creation’s workings. Only then can one pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the Primordial Palace, gather the Five Phases, harmonize the Four Images, where dragon chants and tiger roars, husband sings and wife follows, the jade crucible simmers, and the golden furnace blazes. Only then does the Mysterious Pearl take form, the Great One return to truth—all achieved in but a moment’s effort, securing boundless ease and joy forever.\n\nAs for guarding against danger and anticipating peril, one must be cautious in the application of withdrawal and addition. To nurture correctness and maintain fullness, one must embrace the feminine and hold to the One. Naturally, the qi of returning yang revives, the form of slaying yin is shed. When the cyclical nodes are complete, one sheds the mortal coil through spiritual transformation, one’s name is inscribed in the immortal register, and one is titled a Perfected Person—this is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is established.\n\nYet today’s scholars take lead and mercury as the two qi, point to the viscera as the Five Phases, divide heart and kidneys into Kan and Li, regard liver and lungs as dragon and tiger, use spirit and qi as mother and child, and cling to bodily fluids as lead and mercury. They fail to distinguish sinking from floating, much less discern host from guest. Is this not like mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own or calling a stranger one’s own child? How could they fathom the subtle interplay of metal and wood’s mutual restraint or the essential wonders of yin and yang’s reciprocal use? All this is like the sun and moon losing their path, lead and mercury placed in separate furnaces—how could they hope to congeal the Returning Elixir? Such aspirations are far indeed.\n\nFrom youth, I was devoted to the Dao and delved into the scriptures of the Three Teachings, extending my studies to law, calligraphy, mathematics, medicine, divination, military strategy, astronomy, geography, and the arts of fortune and fate—nothing escaped my careful inquiry. Yet of all these, only the method of the Golden Elixir remained elusive. Having perused all the classics and the songs, poems, and treatises of various schools, I found they spoke of the sun’s essence and the moon’s spirit, the metal tiger and the wood dragon, mercury and cinnabar, silver and tin, the Kan male and the Li female—all capable of forming the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir—but none revealed what true lead and true mercury are, nor explained the methods of fire timing, the degrees of warmth and nurturance, or the ultimate aim.\n\nMoreover, later generations of deluded followers, indulging their whims, have wantonly annotated the sacred teachings of the ancient sages, introducing myriad distortions. Not only do they confound the immortal scriptures, but they also mislead future learners. As I had not yet encountered a perfected being and the oral instructions were hard to come by, I became restless in sleep and meals, my spirit weary. Though I sought counsel across mountains and seas, inquiring of the wise and foolish alike, none could clarify the true essence or illuminate the depths of my heart.\n\nLater, in the year *jiyou* of the Xining era, while accompanying Minister Lu of the Dragon Diagram to Chengdu, my long-held resolve unwavering and my initial sincerity deepening, I was moved to receive from a Perfected One the oral instructions on the Golden Elixir’s ingredients and the fire timing’s secrets. His words were concise, his essentials uncluttered—truly, he pointed to the stream to reveal the source, spoke once to awaken a hundred. The mist dispersed, the sun shone bright, the dust settled, the mirror gleamed clear. Comparing his teachings to the immortal scriptures, they matched as if sealed together.\n\nReflecting that among ten or eight or nine of those who study immortality, scarcely one or two grasp the true essentials, I, having encountered the true key, dared not remain silent. I poured forth all I had received into ninety-nine regulated poems, titling them *Awakening to Reality*. Within are sixteen heptasyllabic quatrains to represent the number of two eights, sixty-four quatrains corresponding to the hexagrams of the *Zhou Changes*, and one pentasyllabic verse to symbolize the Great One. I later added twelve *Xijiangyue* lyrics to align with the twelve months of the year. All matters—such as the hierarchy of crucibles, the weight of ingredients, the advance and retreat of fire timing, the precedence of host and guest, the presence and absence of life and death, and the auspicious and inauspicious—are fully encompassed therein.\n\nAfter completing the collection, I realized it addressed only the arts of nurturing life-destiny and preserving form, while the original awakening of true nature remained unexplored. Thus, I turned to Buddhist scriptures and the *Transmission of the Lamp*, where I found that even the patriarchs had awakened upon hearing the strike of bamboo. This inspired me to compose thirty-two songs, odes, poems, and miscellaneous verses, which I now append to the end of the volume. Here, at last, the Way of realizing the root and illuminating nature is fully expounded.\n\nMay those of like aspiration who peruse this work perceive the branch and awaken to the root, abandon the false and follow the true.\n\nOn the first day of the year *yimao* in the reign of *Xining* of the August Song, Tiantai Zhang Boduan, styled Pingshu, composed this preface.\n\n*Three Commentaries on the \"Awakening to Reality\" of the Perfected One of Purple Yang*\nVolume One\nCommentaries by Xian of Purple Yang, Xue Daoguang; Zi Ye, Lu Shu; and Shangyangzi, Chen Zhixu\n\n**Eight Seven-Character Regulated Verses**\n\nNot seeking the Great Dao to escape delusion’s path,\nEven with worthy talent, how can one be a true man?\nA hundred years of light pass swift as sparks from stone,\nA lifetime’s being drifts like bubbles on the stream.\nOnly chasing profit and rank for fleeting glory,\nHeedless of the body’s withering, unseen decay.\nAsk, then: though gold be piled like mountains high,\nCan impermanence be bought to halt its \"no\"?\n\n**Daoguang’s Commentary:**\nNothing is harder than meeting the right person; nothing easier than attaining the Dao.\nNow, manifesting as a high official or elder, one gathers companions for cultivating the Great Dao and refining the elixir. In an instant, the grain of millet is refined, and one stands firm in the Dao—this is the ease of attaining the Dao.\nYet, draped in purple and girded with gold, with gates deep as the sea, men of the Dao turn away in dismay—this is the difficulty of meeting the right person.\n\nNothing is easier than meeting the right person; nothing harder than attaining the Dao.\nNow, with a hundred coins tied to one’s staff, one wanders the world alone, having long nurtured the numinous root and received the transmission of the Great Dao. Yet while the bonds of dragon and tiger may be easily untied, the lock of the medicinal spoon is hard to open. One may forget the years in obtaining the medicine but lack the means to refine the lead—this is the ease of meeting the right person and the difficulty of attaining the Dao.\nHow can both matters be perfected at once?\nThis is the moment to secretly knock at the mysterious pass, a once-in-a-millennium opportunity—will it be the Isles of Penglai?\n\nThe Immortal Elder wandered to Chengdu, where he encountered the Old Man of Mount Qingcheng and received the wondrous Dao of the Golden Elixir and Returning Cinnabar. Marveling at how effortless it was to complete the medicine, he composed this poem to bind green companions in alchemical fellowship. Its final stanza reads:\n\n*I ask you: though gold be piled mountain-high,*\n*Can impermanence be bought to stay?*\n\nThe words press urgently—even if one offered a pair of jade discs before a team of four horses, it would not compare to sitting and advancing in this Dao. The Immortal Elder has gone far beyond; like high mountains and flowing waters, rare are those who know his tune.\n\nZiye said: *The Dao does not fail man; man fails the Dao.*\nMaster Shangyang said: *From ancient times, sages and worthies have revered the Dao and prized virtue. What is the Dao? The creative transformation of the primordial unity of qi. What is virtue? The accumulation of merit and refinement of qi to become a sage.*\n\nThe superior men of old first accumulated virtue; the sages and worthies of antiquity must first have heard the Dao. Never has one unversed in the Dao been called a sage; never has one who failed to accumulate virtue been deemed worthy. Yet even if one is called worthy, if one does not refine the wondrous Dao, one will merge with the common stream and vanish—such a one cannot be named a great man.\n\nA hundred years of glory pass like lightning; gold and jade piled high cannot avert impermanence. Consider the merit of Han Xin or the wealth of Shi Chong: the more they risked their lives to cast them away, the more they clung to fame and riches, only to destroy themselves. Thus the scripture says: *The true essence of the Dao can govern the body; its remnants may govern the state; its ultimate reaches may govern the world.*\n\nTherefore, to accumulate virtue is to be worthy; to accumulate wealth is to be foolish. Foolish and rich, one’s karma is heavy. Worthy and poor, one’s sins are light. Truly, the Way of Heaven repays in kind.\n\nThe Immortal Elder pitied the world’s fools who hoard wealth and amass property, so he composed this work, beginning with this poem to admonish and exhort people to revere and cultivate the supreme Dao:\n\n*Though man’s life may span a hundred years,*\n*Longevity or early death, poverty or success—none can foreknow.*\n*Yesterday he rode a horse through the streets;*\n*Today his corpse lies in a coffin.*\n*Wife and wealth, cast aside, are no longer his;*\n*The sins he carries will follow—no self-deceit avails.*\n*If one does not seek the Great Medicine, how can one chance upon it?*\n*To encounter it and not refine it is sheer folly.*\n\nDaoguang said: *Unicorns and phoenixes do not appear in every generation; immortals are not often seen. To empty the self of dreams, bubbles, and illusions, to escape the suffering of birth, aging, sickness, and death—this is a rarity among men.*\n\nWhen one meets a master on the Way and receives the master’s guidance, to begin cultivation swiftly is already too late. The Immortal Elder, in composing this poem, concluded with these words: *If one does not seek the Great Medicine, how can one chance upon it? To encounter it and not refine it is sheer folly.* His exhortation is so earnest—those of us who have not yet heard the Dao must seek a master at once. Those who have already met one—how can they sit in folly?\n\nOne should bind the millet of the moment, guard and embrace the empty immortal for nine years, conceal the heart in the Great Void, let the spirit roam the eight directions, reveal half a face amid purple clouds, and answer the immortal trial in the Dark Capital—lest Xu the Immortal alone be praised in the Jin dynasty.\n\nZiye said: *To know is not difficult; to practice is difficult indeed. How wondrous!*\nMaster Shangyang said: *The scripture says: Of men, the long-lived reach a hundred years, the middling eighty, the short-lived sixty. Subtracting days of sorrow, death, and mourning, barely four or five remain in a month. Yet people of this world all covet fame and profit, as if they could enjoy them forever, heedless of death’s approach.*\n\nI often sigh at the world’s fools, who beyond their own bodies are frantic for wives and children, devising a hundred schemes for wealth and honor. Yet once they die, their wives remarry, and their riches pass to new husbands—who would think of the former husband now suffering karmic retribution in hell? Thus the Immortal Elder said: *Wife and wealth, cast aside, are no longer his; the sins he carries will follow—no self-deceit avails.* His compassion is profound. He only wishes for people to cultivate the Dao and escape the wheel of rebirth.\n\nHow many proud and ambitious men, having met a true master who directly points to the Great Dao, still wait until their ambitions are fulfilled and their wishes satisfied before refining the Golden Elixir? Suddenly, Heaven does not grant them the years—what regret can then avail? Is this not folly?\n\nAlas! Those who have not heard must urgently seek a master. Those who have heard must immediately seek the medicine. Man’s longevity or early death cannot be foreknown—abandon attachments at once, cease folly, accept and practice with faith: such a one may be called wise.\n\nThough the study of immortality is the study of celestial immortals, only the Golden Elixir is most certain. When the two substances meet, nature and temperament unite; where the Five Agents are complete, tiger and dragon coil. Originally, *wu* and *ji* served as matchmakers, thus enabling the union of husband and wife in constant joy. Once the work is accomplished, one ascends the northern palace, riding a soaring simurgh amid the radiance of ninefold rosy clouds.\n\nDaoguang said: *Immortals have several ranks. Those whose yin spirits are most numinous yet formless are ghost immortals. Those who live in the world without illness and enjoy long life are human immortals. Those who fly through the air and walk through mist, who hunger not nor thirst, who are untouched by cold or heat, who roam the isles and live forever without dying are earth immortals. Those whose form and spirit are both wondrous, who merge with the true Dao, who walk without casting shadows in sun or moon, who enter metal and stone without hindrance, whose transformations are inexhaustible, whose appearances and vanishings are unfathomable, who may be old or young, who are most sagely and most divine—whom even ghosts and spirits cannot know, whom divination cannot fathom—are celestial immortals.*\n\nLord Yin the True said: *If one can sever desires, cultivate embryonic breathing, nurture the spirit into stillness, shed the husk and invest in a new womb, and transform through yin without decay, one may become a lower-grade ghost immortal. Those who receive the talismans of the Three Armors, the Orthodox Unity Alliance of Might, the wondrous methods of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity, or the arts of sword liberation and corpse release to attain the Dao are all ranked among the immortals of the Southern Palace. Those who cultivate the truth in the various grottoes and attain the Dao are middle-grade immortals. Those who refine the Golden Elixir and complete the Great Medicine, whether by shedding the husk or ascending in broad daylight, are the supreme immortals of the Nine Ultimates.*\n\nThe seventy-two grades of elixir methods all aim at attaining the Dao of Heavenly Immortals, yet only the Golden Elixir is the supreme Way. This is the art of generating something from nothing—refining the primordial True One’s qi before Heaven and Earth were separated. It is not the later-born five metals, eight minerals, cinnabar, mercury, black lead, white tin, yellow dan, realgar, orpiment, sulfur, arsenic powder, autumn stone, plant ash, frost, snow, or ice dregs, nor the substances generated from something within the body’s fluids, essence, qi, blood, or secretions. Only the True One’s qi, which the sage captures and condenses within a single double-hour into a single grain like a millet seed, is called the Golden Elixir, also known as True Lead, Yang Elixir, the essence of the True One, the water of the True One, Water Tiger, or the Taiyi-Containing-True-Qi. Whoever ingests it ascends immediately to the sacred rank—this is the wondrous Way of the supreme Nine Ultimates’ highest-grade Heavenly Immortals, rarely encountered by mortals.\n\nYou five companions have now attained the Great Dao. Sever fleeting thoughts, concentrate your spirit in the Azure Vault, and do not pursue middle or lower paths. Strive instead to realize the position of the supreme Nine Ultimates’ highest-grade Heavenly Immortal.\n\nThe True One’s qi existed before Heaven and Earth, blending within the formless void—dim and indistinct, invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, intangible to grasp. How then can it be condensed into a millet-seed pearl? The sage shapes the real through the formless, manifests the existent through the nonexistent. The real and existent are True Yin and True Yang, beings of the same kind and mutual affinity. The formless and nonexistent are the qi of the waxing and waning crescents—present as qi yet lacking substance. When these two take form, one thing is born. That \"one\" is the True One’s qi condensed into a millet-seed pearl. As the scripture says: *The Primordial Beginning suspended a precious pearl, large as a millet seed, within the Empty Mystery*—this is its proof.\n\nFearing the leakage of celestial secrets, the sages used True Yin and True Yang as metaphors for the Green Dragon and White Tiger, and the qi of the two crescents as metaphors for True Lead and True Mercury. In the immortal elders’ poetic verses, the Dragon is further named the Crimson Dragon, Thunder Dragon, Celestial Soul, Qian House, Qian Crucible, Jade Tripod, Jade Furnace, Fusang, Lower Crescent, Eastern Yang, Eldest Son, Cinnabar Mercury, Quicksilver, Cinnabar, Li Sun, Crimson Phoenix—all metaphors for the Green Dragon. The Tiger is named the Black Tiger, Dui Tiger, Earthly Soul, Kun Position, Kun Tripod, Metal Furnace, Metal Tripod, Mount Hua, Upper Crescent, Western River, Youngest Daughter, Black Lead, Crescent Moon Furnace, Kan Moon, Black Tortoise—all metaphors for the White Tiger.\n\nThe Dragon’s crescent qi is called True Mercury, the Alchemical Maiden, Wood Sap, Green Maiden, Mercury Enveloped in Vermilion, Nature, White Snow, Flowing Pearl, Green-Clad Maiden, Golden Crow, Li Maiden, Qian Dragon, True Fire, the Sixteen-Year-Old Alchemical Maiden, Jade Mushroom—all one and the same. The Tiger’s crescent qi is called True Lead, Metal Elder, Metal Essence, Gold in Water, Silver in Water, Sentiment, Yellow Sprout, Golden Flower, White-Clad Gentleman, Jade Hare, Kan Son, Male Tiger, True Water, Nine-Three Gentleman, Knife-Tip Powder—all one and the same.\n\nWhen these two beings meet and sentiment and nature unite, the two become Dragon and Tiger. The Green Dragon in the East belongs to Wood, which generates Fire. The Dragon’s crescent qi is Fire, called Nature, belonging to the South—termed the Vermilion Bird. The White Tiger in the West belongs to Metal, which generates Water. The Tiger’s crescent qi is Water, called Sentiment, belonging to the North—termed the Dark Warrior. When Wood, Fire, Metal, and Water unite, Dragon and Tiger’s sentiment and nature communicate, the Four Symbols converge at the Center, and the work returns to Wuji Earth. Earth is the Elixir. This is called the perfection of the true Five Phases.\n\nWuji serves as the matchmaker: Wood in the East and Metal in the West, their sentiments separated—who will act as matchmaker? Only the Yellow Dame can unite them, leading the Dragon to the Tiger as husband and wife. Wuji belongs to Earth, called the Yellow Dame. Though Dragon and Tiger dwell in East and West, the Yellow Dame enables their joyful union. Though Metal and Wood are divided, the Yellow Dame brings their fusion. These two conceal the True One’s qi; when the two are one, the True One’s qi transforms, and the True Person naturally emerges—this is the external medicine’s symbolic method.\n\nWhen the Elixir ripens in the human realm, merit is accomplished in Heaven, enveloped in ninefold rosy clouds, with winds rising beneath both armpits. Without planting the spiritual root through vast cultivation of hidden virtue, who could speak of this?\n\nZiye said: *Without the Golden Elixir, one cannot attain the Dao of Heavenly Immortals. Yet what is this Golden Elixir?* Ah! Clearly it is originally my own substance, entrusted to the Kun Palace—Kun is the human. What are these two things? Myself and the other. When self and other meet, sentiment and nature harmonize, and the Five Phases are complete. Dragon and Tiger are merely sentiment and nature. Yet how does this \"meeting\" occur? Within active use, there is no merit; within merit, active use is applied. Ah! *Dense bamboo does not hinder flowing water; high mountains do not obstruct drifting clouds.*\n\nWuji is the Center, the position of correctness. Wuji is the Earth of intent. When the intents of self and other unite, the joy of husband and wife is attained. If Yin’s intent seeks Yang while Yang’s intent does not seek Yin, Yin and Yang clash without interpenetration, and no thing is born.\n\nThus, Wu and Ji are the homeland of all living things, for the generation of life depends upon intent. True Earth has no fixed position, its intent is formless—how wondrous, how wondrous!\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Daoguang spoke of immortals as comprising several ranks—ghost immortals, human immortals, earth immortals, spirit immortals, and heavenly immortals—while Lord Yin Zhen further divided them into upper, middle, and lower grades, all to clarify that the heavenly immortal is the most exalted. For the Way of the heavenly immortal, apart from the Golden Elixir, there exists no other method. The Golden Elixir is the primordial qi of Yin and Yang, the antecedent of the Supreme Ultimate, the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhat are these \"two things\"? They are Qian and Kun, being and non-being, sentiment and nature, Li and Kan, water and fire, sun and moon, male and female, Dragon and Tiger, lead and mercury, the aperture and the marvel, the Mysterious and the Female, Wu and Ji, the Crow and the Hare, essence and qi, the Tortoise and the Serpent, self and other, the self and the body, metal and wood, host and guest, floating and sinking, firmness and softness, the zither and the sword, Yin and Yang. All declare that Qian and Kun are the substance of the two things, Yin and Yang their root, Dragon and Tiger their image, male and female their name, lead and mercury their essence, self and other their division, essence and qi their function, the Mysterious Female their gateway.\n\nOnly the primordial, undifferentiated, true One qi arises from within these two things. Thus, the one Yang is fundamentally Qian, yet after succumbing to greed and delusion, Qian’s one Yang lodges within Kun’s middle line, forming Kan. The one Yin is Kun, yet after error and disorder, Kun breaks Qian’s wholeness, pointing to become Li. Within Li, there is only mercury. Within Kan, what is found is called lead. Lead is born from the White Tiger, hence it is called the Tiger’s bowstring qi. Mercury is born from the Azure Dragon, hence it is called the Dragon’s bowstring qi. The Dragon pertains to wood, and wood generates fire, thus it is said the Dragon emerges from within fire. The Tiger pertains to metal, and metal generates water, thus it is said the Tiger is born within water. Names denote the substance of things; their use refers to what is produced within them.\n\nThus it is said that when the two substances meet, it is the union of one emotion and one nature, the joyous meeting of one Qian and one Kun, the reunion of one Yin and one Yang. Only through meeting can there be union. Wu and Ji serve as the matchmakers—*mei* is that which conveys the messages between the two families, while *pin* is that which transmits the momentary passage. Yet there is both an inner and an outer: externally, as the Muddy Pellet Elder said, \"Without shared speech, it is not a matter of spring affinity.\" Internally, Wu and Ji are the gateways of Qian and Kun, the coming and going of Yin and Yang, the rising and falling of Dragon and Tiger, the matchmakers of male and female. For lead lies in the west and mercury in the east, separated by a thousand miles—were it not for Wu and Zi acting as mutual matchmakers to bring them together, how could the true qi of the One be produced?\n\nThis \"husband and wife\" are not the husband and wife of the mundane world. The couples of the world rejoice in bearing sons and daughters, delight in the depletion of their essence and spirit. From this arise affection and attachment, from this arise birth, aging, illness, and death, suffering that binds and entangles. Thus the scripture says: parents are taken for their kindness, wives and concubines for their love, children for their form—all are constrained by the realm of desire and love, unable to sever themselves from the domain of wealth and honor. Only the sage can act according to the times, neither grasping nor rejecting. To bear children in one’s prime is to continue the moral order; yet by forty, to remain unconfused and unmoved in heart is not to be controlled by love and procreation.\n\nThe \"husband and wife\" of the Golden Elixir are uniquely wondrous. There are also inner and outer aspects, with several explanations: for the Tiger to wed the Dragon is outer; for Kan to be matched with Li is outer; for the Zhen male to seek the Dui female is outer. As for lead uniting with mercury, that is inner; qi uniting with spirit, that is inner; the merging of being into non-being, that is inner. All these are likened to the union of male and female, yet they transform suffering into joy, leaving no trace of affection or attachment, and regard severance and relinquishment as paramount. Their intercourse lasts but half an hour, and they obtain the pearl the size of a millet grain—thus they become neither of the myriad things nor of humankind, but through reverse cultivation attain immortality and Buddhahood. These are the \"husband and wife\" of the Golden Elixir.\n\nThough every household possesses this, it is not one’s own to use, for what is seen cannot be employed. Should one seek it, the essential method and resources must be found within the divine continent of the Red County, for its use is not something visible. To refine this Golden Elixir, one must first cultivate the self in preparation for the moment when Yang arises. Without the work of self-cultivation, even if the two substances meet, the matchmakers unite, and the husband and wife are true, one will see lead arrive only for mercury to fail to respond.\n\nThus the ancient immortals and sagely masters first refined this Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor before ascending in broad daylight. Examples include the Yellow Emperor at Lake Dinghu, and the ascensions of Zhang, Ge, and Xu. These are but the few known to the world—how much more remains unsaid! And how much more remains unknown!\n\nThus the tradition states: roughly thirty thousand adorned persons have ascended in flight, and over eight hundred households have been lifted whole. All these attained immortality through the Dao of the Golden Elixir, having accumulated merit and layered practice—how could they fail to soar on phoenixes and pay court at the Northern Palace?\n\nThis method is true within the true, most wondrous—all verdant while I alone differ from others.\nI know reversal comes from *li* and *kan*,\nbut who discerns the floating and sinking to fix host and guest?\nIf the golden crucible retains cinnabar-wrapped mercury,\nthe jade pool first receives silver from water.\nThe divine work of firing does not last the whole dawn—\na single wheel of moon emerges from the deep pool.\n\nDao Guang says: This Dao is most numinous, most sagely, most honored, most noble, most simple, most easy—profound beyond profundity, wondrous within the wondrous, rarely heard of in the world. The immortal elders stand apart from their kind, transmitting its deep purport alone.\n\nMaster Wang Chongzhao of the Real says: Of all the Daoists in the world, none grasp the Dao of the Golden Elixir—only Ping Shu did so over time, and none other. How could one dare compare the anthills of Mount Tai or the flowing torrents of rivers and seas?\n\n*Li* is Yang and dwells in the south, yet it is reversed to become female—externally Yang but internally Yin, this is called true mercury.\n*Kan* is Yin and dwells in the north, yet it is reversed to become male—externally Yin but internally Yang, this is called true lead.\nThe later poem says:\nThe sun abides in *li*’s position yet turns female,\n*Kan* matches the toad palace yet becomes male.\nThis speaks of *kan* as male and *li* as female, like the father’s essence and the mother’s blood, the sun’s crow and the moon’s hare, mercury in cinnabar and silver in lead, the dark of heaven and the yellow of earth. All these refer to the initial arc of Dragon and Tiger qi.\n\nReversal of host and guest: Yang is noble and high, dwelling on the left—this is the host. Yin is humble and low, dwelling on the right—this is the guest. *Li* is fire, fire flames upward, and the nature of fire and wood both float—this is the host. *Kan* is water, water flows downward, and the nature of water and metal both sink—this is the guest. This is the ordinary Dao.\n\nNow, *li* is reversed to become female, and *kan* is reversed to become male—thus the host becomes the guest, and the guest becomes the host. Moreover, in the Dao, one takes the reversed meaning of the two arcs to determine host and guest, not the ordinary host and guest.\n\nThe golden crucible: gold is a Yin substance, yet within the crucible lies the most Yang qi—this is the image of Yin containing Yang, the White Tiger. The jade pool: jade is a Yang substance, yet within the pool lies the most Yin qi—this is the image of Yang containing Yin, the Azure Dragon. Mercury in cinnabar is the arc qi of the Dragon; silver in water is the arc qi of the Tiger.\n\nIf the cultivator of the Elixir wishes to retain the Tiger with the Dragon, they must first drive the Tiger to the Dragon. Then the two qi intermingle, the two natures unite, and through the work of firing and refinement, the true One’s essence naturally congeals.\n\nFiring refers to the qi of the two arcs. Dawn is the beginning of the day, the origin of the six Yang—hence it is called *dan*. The sage moves the elixir fire with divine and wondrous power, and in less than half an hour, obtains a single grain of the true One’s essence, large as a millet seed, appearing in the Northern Sea—its light piercing through curtains, like a brilliant sun wheel emerging from the deep pool.\n\n\"Not lasting the whole dawn\" means that within a single hour, the Golden Elixir is instantly accomplished. This is the outer medicine’s symbolic form.\n\nZiye said: I originate from *li* yet revert to *yin*; that one originates from *kan* yet reverts to *yang*. Above and below reverse their proper order—hence it is called \"inversion.\" That lead sinks, and sinking means descent. My mercury floats, and floating means ascent. Using mercury to restrain lead, that one becomes the host while I become the guest. *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: \"The lead Dragon ascends, the mercury Tiger descends—subtle, oh so subtle!\" The Classic says: \"The mouth is the Jade Pool of Grand Harmony Palace.\" The Golden Crucible represents me; the Jade Pool represents that one. Retaining the mercury within my body, I secure the silver of the Jade Pool’s return, restraining it so it does not flee. Silver is lead.\n\nFire arises when the qi of *yin* and *yang* unite and move inward; inward movement generates warmth and harmony, enabling it to fuse the true essence of things and cause their union. If the qi of *yin* and *yang* do not unite, it is not fire. Today’s scholars mistake uninterrupted breathing for \"moving fire\"—how erroneous! They do not realize that uninterrupted breathing is the *yin* tally. Why? The number two pertains to fire, while one pertains to water; combined, they form two, but uncombined, they remain one. The marvel lies in the moment when, beneath accumulated *yin*, the solitary *yang* returns. Thus, fire must be applied in accordance with the proper timing—this principle is clear. If scholars grasp its subtlety and apply it, the *yang* qi will return to the Cinnabar Field, radiating brilliance like the sun over a deep pool—how wondrous its effect!\n\nShangyangzi said: \"The word 'subtle'—who would believe it?\" Those who differ from others are those who, while the world is deluded by love and desire, discern within love and desire. What is this discernment? The sage employs *li* and *kan* in inversion, calling it \"water above, fire below.\" Employing *qian* and *kun* in inversion, it is called \"earth above, heaven below.\" Employing husband and wife in inversion, it is called \"man below, woman above.\" Floating and sinking: fire and wood rise and dominate above as host, while water and metal descend and submit below as guest. This is the human Dao, the worldly method, the natural sequence of the Five Phases.\n\nNow, though fire and wood naturally float, we cause them to descend and become guest. Though metal and water naturally sink, we cause them to ascend and become host. This is the immortal Dao, the supramundane method, the mutual completion of water and fire, the inversion of the Five Phases. The Golden Crucible and Jade Pool, where the Dao’s light converges, do not depart from the mechanism of inversion—yet one must not lose the meaning of \"desiring to retain\" and \"prior descent.\" Ziye’s analogy of the Golden Crucible as me and the Jade Pool as that one aligns with Master Ziyang’s intent. Why? Because what preserves one’s own essence, qi, blood, and fluids is cinnabar-coated mercury—it must not be allowed to escape, hence \"desiring to retain.\" As for that one’s Flower Pool divine fluid and Elixir Well sweet spring, they are silver within water, the primordial single point of true qi—hence \"prior descent.\"\n\n\"Desiring to retain\" means merely keeping it present without letting it depart, seeking it from the other while not losing it oneself. \"Prior descent\" means awaiting its arrival while I prepare, mercury welcoming lead, *kan* moving while *li* receives. The Dao of the Golden Elixir first requires clarity on these four characters: \"desiring to retain\" and \"prior descent.\" \"Fire is not applied for the whole dawn\" means fire must be moved with gentle warmth. Thus, *The Kinship of the Three* states: \"At the outset of firing, warmth is subtle, like the stirring of a hexagram line.\" The Venerable Pure Yang said: \"In the deep of night, the clepsydra’s flow is warm; the lead crucible’s light pierces the curtains.\" For at the inception of all things’ transformation, they receive the qi of *yin* and *yang* in but a fleeting moment. How much more so with this Dao of supreme immortality, which refines the primordial qi—its speed is even swifter! Thus the Buddha said, \"Like dew, like lightning,\" referring to its utmost purity and subtlety, its rapid efficacy, for it cannot endure long—prolonged, it incurs loss and deficiency.\n\nIf this primordial true lead is returned to the Suspended Womb Chamber, is this not like the red sun appearing over a deep pool? \"The Tiger leaps, the Dragon soars—waves surge roughly; at the central true position, the Mysterious Pearl is born. Though fruit on the branch will ripen in time, how is the child in the womb different? South and North trace their origins in hexagram images; dawn and dusk’s firing accords with the celestial pivot. Know that the great hermit dwells in the marketplace—why seek solitude in the deep mountains?\"\n\nDaoguang said: This speaks of the inner medicine’s symbolic form. The true One’s essence, though its transformation occurs externally, is called the Golden Elixir, or true earth. When swallowed into the abdomen, it is named true lead, or yang elixir. Here, the Tiger is the Golden Elixir. The Dragon is my true qi. The wind and waves are my true qi surging forth from the Sea of Qi, billowing like waves, stirring like wind. The central true position is the Golden Womb’s divine chamber within the Cinnabar Field, the place where the elixir congeals and qi coalesces. The Mysterious Pearl is the infant, also called the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir.\n\nThe Golden Elixir, formed from the union of the primordial single qi, is the mother, the sovereign, the lead—hence it is called the Tiger. My true qi, born of the posterior heaven, is the child, the minister, the mercury—hence it is called the Dragon. The Golden Elixir comes from without; when swallowed into the abdomen, my true qi wells up from the lower Sea of Qi like wind and waves, serving it as a minister serves a sovereign, as a child serves a mother—their mutual intent is evident. Dragon and Tiger unite within the divine chamber, forming the sacred embryo, like fruit ripening on the branch, like a child destined to be born in the womb. After ten months of work, the embryo naturally detaches, and spiritual transformation knows no bounds.\n\nSouth and North are *zi* and *wu*. The origin of the lineage is the sprouting of the seedling.\n\nDawn and dusk mark the beginnings of day and night. The *zi* hour stands as the first of the six yang hours, hence it is dawn. The *wu* hour stands as the first of the six yin hours, hence it is dusk. At dawn, the *Zhun* hexagram governs affairs, the proper time for advancing fire. At dusk, the *Meng* hexagram governs affairs, the proper time for advancing water. One day encompasses two hexagrams, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng*, and concluding with *Jiji* and *Weiji*. Cycling endlessly in repetition, this is called \"revolving the hexagrams.\" As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"At the new moon’s dawn, *Zhun* governs; by evening, *Meng* takes its turn. Day and night each hold one hexagram, applied in due sequence. From *Jiwei* to the end of the month, the cycle concludes and begins anew.\"\n\nOne day sees two hexagrams governing affairs; one month accounts for sixty hexagrams. Each hexagram has six lines, and including the four *yin-yang* hexagrams, totals three hundred eighty-four lines, corresponding to the intercalary days of a year. The first nine of *Qian* arises from the first six of *Kun*. *Qian*’s tally is thirty-six, its lines numbering two hundred sixteen. The first six of *Kun* arises from the first nine of *Qian*. *Kun*’s tally is twenty-four, its six lines numbering one hundred forty-four. Together they sum to three hundred sixty, matching the celestial cycle.\n\nThe movements of the sun and moon—conjunction and ascent, descent—never exceed the bounds of the hexagrams and lines. The moon moves swiftly, completing one celestial cycle in a month. The sun moves slowly, completing one cycle in a year. The Celestial Pivot is the Northern Dipper; it completes one revolution each day and night, shifting its position once each month. Thus, in the first month it aligns with *yin*, in the second with *mao*, and so forth. Hence it is said: \"Each month it invariably advances to *xu*, at every hour revealing the Breaking Army.\"\n\nThe perfected and realized ones know the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, comprehend the ascent and descent of yin and yang, and practice the *zi-wu* fire signs. The sun governs day, the moon governs night; adjusting in accord with the seasons, they subtly align with celestial measures—thus it is called \"harmonizing with the Celestial Pivot.\" The supreme Dao, the most wondrous, lies precisely here.\n\nThe ascent and descent of *Kan* and *Li* generate the numinous medicine, first congealing the Yellow Sprout. The great medicine of the Golden Elixir is possessed by every household, unbound by marketplace or court. Yet how many recognize the Dragon when they see it, or the Tiger? Few indeed are those who cultivate it in reverse.\n\nIn the span of a single moment, a pearl forms, as large as a grain of millet. One must not gaze upon it in the palm, nor speak of it once swallowed into the abdomen. Master Ziye said: \"The rough winds and waves are the imagery of the two qi in mutual arousal. After their arousal, the winds subside and the waves calm. The medicine is gathered and returned to the Central Palace—a single grain of millet, growing from the subtle to the manifest, thus forming the embryo. Warm and nurture it, and in time it will ripen. Like fruit on the branch, like a child in the womb, there is no difference.\"\n\nThe central and correct position is the Yellow Court; the Yellow Court is the lower Cinnabar Field. The South and North as lineage origins: the South is *Li*, the self; the North is *Kan*, the other.\n\nExtract the line within *Kan* to restore my *Li*, thus forming *Qian*—this is called \"reversing the hexagram image.\" The fire is as noted previously. The timing follows the sequence of *Zhun* at dawn and *Meng* at dusk. With *Zhun* at dawn and *Meng* at dusk, the movements of morning and evening naturally align with the celestial mechanism.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: The dragon is the yin within *Li*. The tiger is the yang within *Kan*. By subduing the dragon of my own house, mercury will not escape. By taming the tiger within the other, one obtains the lead essence from within it. The rough winds and waves are the symbolic representation of the internal and external fire-timing—this must be approached with utmost care. Externally, when tending the furnace, one must neither overdo nor neglect. Internally, after the elixir has formed, its nurturance must not falter.\n\nThe Immortal Elder compares a single grain of true yang to the tiger, for the tiger is the most difficult creature to control. Thus, the *Xici* of the *Yi* states: \"Treading on a tiger’s tail, it bites a man—ominous.\" This means that if one treads without following the Way, the tiger will bite. It is like being amidst a raging storm and towering waves, ever fearful of capsizing and ruin.\n\nAt the moment of gathering the medicine, firmly grasp the single thought—internally observe the heart, yet the heart is no-heart; externally observe the form, yet the form is no-form; distantly observe things, yet things are no-things. By directing intention to meet it, the Mysterious Pearl is born within the cinnabar field.\n\nAs for the inverted hexagrams: Kan above and Li below form \"Water and Fire in Mutual Aid\"; Qian below and Kun above form \"Heaven and Earth in Peace\"; Dui above and Zhen below form \"Lake and Thunder Following\"; Gen below and Dui above form \"Lake and Mountain in Harmony.\" The Celestial Pivot is the Dipper’s handle. The Dao of the Golden Elixir lies wondrously in celestial resonance. The pivot of the Dipper stands as the human pole—serene and unmoving, yet responsive and instantly penetrating. This is what the Buddhists call *vajra*. Those who embody this early seek the Elixir. This Elixir exists within humankind and is sought amidst the marketplace. The so-called Divine Continent of the Red Earth is where the Great Medicine is produced—it is not found in deep mountains or vast marshes, nor is it hidden in famous grottoes. Why? Mountains are high and thus yang is scarce; marshes are remote and thus yin is solitary.\n\nThere are fools who, upon hearing of cultivation, immediately speak of sitting motionless in deep mountains or dwelling alone in desolate valleys. Alas! Do they know what Bodhidharma or Mazu truly meant? Mazu, before refining the Great Medicine, sat in dry meditation seeking the Buddha—hence the mockery of \"grinding bricks.\" Bodhidharma, having entered the chamber at Changlu, practiced in the cold seclusion of Shaolin. Cultivation and practice each have their time. Thus, my master said: \"Sitting in stillness is a matter for *after* obtaining the Elixir.\" If one cannot achieve great concealment amidst the marketplace, why insist on solitude in the mountains?\n\nWhenever I speak of this, I cannot help but sigh deeply. Roughly speaking, this chapter reveals that Daoist radiance has already attained the External Elixir, yet it merely illustrates the symbolic forms of the Internal Medicine. Hence it says: \"The Golden Elixir comes from outside the self; when swallowed into the belly, one knows the true qi surges from the lower Sea of Qi, like winds and waves rising in tumult.\" Yet Ziye says, \"The wind is calm, the waves are still,\" which seems contradictory. The Immortal Masters each express their views, all urging disciples to ponder carefully, discern clearly, refine diligently, and practice assiduously.\n\nWhen tending the furnace, visions naturally appear. Once the true unity of lead is obtained and returned to the spirit-chamber, one must only guard with reticence. Like fruit on the branch waiting for the season to ripen, or a child in the womb waiting for qi to complete, when the time is ripe and qi is full, transformation occurs naturally.\n\nEvery person possesses the medicine of longevity—it is only the deluded who foolishly cast it aside. When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite; where the yellow sprout grows, Kan and Li converge. The well-frog claims there is no dragon’s cave; the hedge-sparrow disputes the phoenix’s nest. When the Elixir ripens, gold fills the house—why seek herbs to burn thatch?\n\nDaoguang says: \"Sweet dew and yellow sprout are alternate names for the Golden Elixir. Heaven and earth, Kan and Li, are the symbolic forms of dragon and tiger. When the qi of heaven and earth intermingle, sweet dew descends naturally. When the qi of Kan and Li unite, the yellow sprout grows naturally. When the qi of the dragon and tiger’s two strings copulate, the Golden Elixir forms naturally. This supreme treasure exists in every household, yet because it is too near, it is lightly discarded. Little do they know it is the cloud-ladder to ascension.\n\nModern scholars often cling to heterodox methods—solitary yin, orphaned yang, existence arising from existence, easily encountered but difficult to complete—and apply them to the body. They do not realize this Dao is simple and easily accomplished, like the frog in the well or the sparrow in the hedge, unaware of the phoenix’s nest or the dragon’s cave. Once the pearl of millet is hung, the intention of heaven and earth can be grasped. As the scripture says: \"When the earth’s treasury is opened, gold and jade reveal their forms.\" This is the proof. Why seek herbs and burn thatch year after year?\n\nAlas, I am old—whose fault is this?\n\nZiye says: \"What is the thing called longevity? Hm! Children and grandchildren, following what goes and reversing what comes—who knows the eternal sigh? Yellow sprout and sweet dew are both names for medicine; heaven and earth, Kan and Li, are in truth the human being. When heaven and earth unite, when Kan and Li converge, the medicine is born. Fools and ignorant ones do not know this Dao, resigned to awaiting their end. The frog and sparrow know not the phoenix’s nest or the dragon’s cave.\"\n\nShangyangzi says: \"The previous three poems have already exhausted the wonders of the Returned Elixir. This chapter further expounds the essential meaning of sweet dew’s descent. The Dao of the Golden Elixir exists in every person, in every household. The foolish are deluded and unaware; mediocre people may occasionally hear of it but do not believe, instead slandering it. The *Yi*’s *Peace* hexagram says: 'Heaven and earth unite—peace.' It also says: 'Heaven and earth unite, and the myriad things communicate; above and below unite, and their aspirations are the same.' When a single yang qi ascends and a single yin qi descends, sweet dew falls. If true water moistens above and true fire blazes below, the yellow sprout forms. Know that sweet dew and yellow sprout are the primordial unity of qi. When this qi arrives, the Elixir forms immediately. Yet if above and below do not unite, their aspirations differ; if heaven and earth do not harmonize, this qi does not descend; if yin and yang are not of the same kind, the yellow sprout is not produced.\n\nThe Immortal Elder explicitly speaks of sweet dew’s descent to make people understand the principle of heaven and earth in peace. When Kan and Li unite, one knows the Dao of water and fire in mutual aid. Alas! The world’s people have narrow experience, like well-frogs and hedge-sparrows—how can they have far-reaching vision? How can they know the Mysterious Female’s gate, from which sweet dew descends and the yellow sprout grows? How can they witness the dragon’s cave and phoenix’s nest as auspicious signs? Instead, they cling to what is before their eyes—seeking herbs, burning thatch—how laughable!\"\n\nHave you not heard what Pure Yang Elder said? The Ninth River’s Prefect Zhang consumed elixirs and lost his sight, his spirit and qi withered—he knew not that the Reverted Elixir has no substance, yet he recklessly ingested metals and minerals. How foolish indeed! Listen carefully to these words—can you not be cautious?\n\nPeople are born endowed with heaven and earth’s purest qi, and thus all may comprehend the sages’ Way. Yet why do distinctions of worthiness, foolishness, poverty, and lowliness arise? How much worse when blind masters lead them into side doors!\n\nKnow this: the place where medicine is produced, the source of the river, lies only in the southwest—this is its native land. When lead meets the birth of *gui*, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the distant full moon, it is no longer fit to taste. Send it back to the earthen crucible, seal it tightly, then join it with flowing pearls for pairing. The medicine weighs one *jin*, requiring two eights; regulate the fire’s timing, entrusting it to yin and yang.\n\nThe *Daoist Radiance* states: \"The medicine is in the southwest, gathered in *wu-ji*. Harvest it at the proper time, and the day for effort arrives.\" The southwest is the *kun* direction, the land of the White Tiger. It is also the place where the moon is born each month—hence called its native land. The moon is the essence of metal and water; at the two crescents, metal and water’s qi unite to give birth. Thus, the medicine’s source and the river’s origin for the Golden Elixir truly emerge from the *kun* earth.\n\n\"Lead sees *gui* born\" refers to the approach of the *chou* hour. \"Gold meets the distant full moon\" means the moon is waning. The moon’s waxing and waning depend on oral instructions; the timing of *zi* and *wu* lies in heart-to-heart transmission. The breath of the celestial cycle is a subtle count, each moment aligned with the jade clepsydra’s chilling tones. This is the true esoteric teaching passed mouth to mouth.\n\nYet how do side doors proliferate—mistaking cinnabar for lead, using *tian-gui* to extract it, no different from child’s play! Ye Wenshu’s phrase \"kun receives *gui*\" is equally laughable. Lu Sicheng’s preface says: \"This poem’s transmission is rife with errors—taking *lead* as *if*, *gold* as *like*—greatly distorting the Immortal Elder’s intent.\" Little do they know that lead and gold *are* the Golden Elixir. All this stems from never meeting a true master, recklessly forcing interpretations.\n\nMaster Lu exposed the error, correcting the misreadings of *Yufu* and *Qilü*. He concealed the source, fearing its spread in written records. We have received the mysterious teaching firsthand and should understand it ourselves. If not, within the void’s emptiness, five *zhang* above the earth, the pearl of millet is not easily obtained.\n\nWhen ingesting the elixir, return it to the Yellow Court’s earthen crucible—it must be firmly sealed so the embryo does not leak. Circulate the fire, flying the flowing pearl of mercury to pair with it, and the sacred embryo will form. Raven’s liver, eight *liang*; hare’s marrow, half a *jin*—two eights, eight *liang*, combining into one *jin*—hence \"the medicine weighs one *jin*, requiring two eights.\" The fire is not truly fire; it relies on yin and yang’s qi to regulate and move it.\n\nZiye said:\n\"The medicine emerges in the southwest, the *kun* position—\nTo seek the *kun* position, how could it leave the person?\nI speak plainly for you to remember—\nOnly fear that when you meet it, you may not recognize it as real.\"\n\n*Gui* is the medicine. When the medicine is about to be born, hasten to gather it—only then is it usable. If delayed, the medicine will have already taken form; once form arises, it becomes a post-heaven substance, and as the saying goes, \"what is seen cannot be used.\" At this time, the water’s source is utterly pure, possessing qi but no form—lasting only one hour in a day. The *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: \"In a day’s twelve hours, wherever the mind arrives, all may be the proper time.\"\n\n\"Gold meets the distant full moon\" is a metaphor for missing the time to gather the medicine—its qi has passed, like the moon after the full, waning day by day, called \"no longer fit to taste.\" The mirror was originally bright, but dust obscured it and dimmed it. The lead pearl alone gleams because *gui* accumulates and gradually hides it. When dust is removed, the mirror’s body remains; when *gui* is exhausted, lead’s brilliance reappears. Lead must be swiftly gathered, lest *gui* water gradually arise later. Gold is the same—borrowing the mirror’s dust-obscured state as a metaphor.\n\nHaving gathered the medicine born of *gui*, place it in the cinnabar field, then firmly seal it to prevent leakage and the escape of numinous medicine. Next, circulate one’s own yin mercury to pair and unite with it, forming the sacred embryo. The sealing method, as the *Triple Concordance* says: \"The *li* qi receives the constructive and defensive; *kan* then does not lose its hearing. *Dui* joins without speech—silence accords with the vast primeval chaos.\" It also says: \"Mercury itself becomes flowing pearls; when yin and yang balance, the sacred embryo forms.\" If one side is deficient, even a hair’s difference will fail to produce the elixir.\n\nOnce the sacred embryo is formed, without regulating the fire’s timing, how can one hope for completion? Master Shangyang said: The *Book of Changes* states, \"In the southwest, one obtains companions and walks with one’s kind.\" The southwest is the *kun* direction, land of like kind—where lead is produced and medicine is born. *Dui* replaces *kun* to embrace yang and form *kan*; *dui*’s initial *gui* is true yin and true yang. The first movement is called *gui* giving birth to heaven and earth. After seven days, it returns—*fu* is *zi*. The Greater Yin emerges after three days—*geng* is metal. In the human body, after three days, one observes the meridian—*jing* is lead. After *gui* moves, lead is born; lead’s initial birth is called the qi of primordial true unity. This qi is named *Golden Flower*.\n\nSpeaking of lead and *gui* without mentioning water emphasizes its qi. Lead is born after *gui*; yang is produced within lead. Gathering true lead, borrowing the term \"refining the elixir,\" the work takes only half an hour—this aligns with the great transformation. Thus, in a month, there is only one day; in a day, only one hour. This hour is most difficult to obtain, for it is when heaven and earth unite their virtue, sun and moon unite their brightness—the true mechanism of generation and transformation. Reversing and cultivating it, one transcends the ordinary and enters sagehood. Thus, the Immortal Elder most urgently emphasizes swiftly gathering when *gui* is born.\n\nSending it back to the earthen crucible, pairing it with flowing pearls, regulating the fire’s timing—this completes the sacred embryo. I now reveal heaven and earth’s mechanism to clarify the Immortal Elder’s earnest intent.\n\nThe superior scholar who awakens to this truth should diligently practice without doubt. The subtle and meticulous principles of harmonization lie in one’s wholehearted effort and devoted practice, delving deeply into its wondrous transformations. Laozi said: *\"Subtle, mysterious, and profoundly penetrating—this is the mark of the superior scholar.\"*\n\nAbandon the refining of the Three Yellows and Four Spirits; seeking myriad medicines is not the true path. When yin and yang of the same kind unite in mutual resonance, when the two eights correspond, they naturally bond in affinity. At the pond’s depths, the sun glows red and yin’s aberrations vanish; on the mountain’s peak, the moon shines white and the medicinal sprout renews.\n\nPeople of this age must recognize true lead and mercury—they are not common cinnabar or quicksilver. Daoguang said: *\"The Three Yellows, Four Spirits, metals, stones, herbs, and trees are all post-celestial, turbid substances of earthly generation. How can they transform the formed into the formless?\"* The Classic states: *\"External things cannot form the embryo; how can flowers strung together bear fruit?\"*\n\nThe *qi* of True Unity arises before heaven and earth, dim and obscure, beyond all measure. Through the correspondence of the two eights, they unite in affinity, and within their misty, resonant interaction, form takes shape. Those of the same kind possess *\"emotion without emotion, color without color\"*—such as eight ounces of crow’s liver or half a catty of hare’s marrow.\n\nZiye said: *\"The Golden Elixir is formed by the union of true yin and true yang—it cannot be made from external medicines.\"* The word *\"kind\"* is of utmost importance: the union of yin and yang depends on finding its kind; without it, all efforts are in vain. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Like attracts like; discordant affairs yield no treasure. Swallows do not hatch phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses.\"*\n\nThe correspondence of the two eights depends on the adept. With the right person, the medicine suffers no loss, and the crucible knows no leakage. The medicine resides in the lower *dantian*, tempered by fire, like the sun over a pond—within the body, all yin *qi* is consumed. The white moon and new medicinal sprout signify the moment when metal is born within water. The *\"mountain’s peak moon\"* illustrates the *kan* trigram’s proper placement above, thus completing the path of *\"already achieved.\"*\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: *\"The mechanism has its rises and falls; harmful *qi* flees in haste. Like the Yangtze and Huai running dry, their waters flow into the sea.\"* The *\"Song of the Crucible\"* states: *\"Yin above, yang rushes below.\"* How wondrous! Without the true transmission of a genuine master, how dare one presume to speculate with private conjecture?\n\nMercury is the innate treasure of my household; lead is the deathless formula of another. To mistake common cinnabar and quicksilver for these is to guess in vain to the end. Shangyangzi said: *\"The Three Yellows and Four Spirits—such as realgar, sulfur, orpiment, red lead, black lead, mercury, common cinnabar, base elixirs, metals, stones, herbs, and trees—are all false. One must seek true yin and true yang.\"* Thus, the Immortal Elder instructs later generations through the principle of *\"kind\"*—a most profound and earnest teaching.\n\n*\"Kind\"* means heaven pairs with earth, the sun with the moon, woman with man, mercury with lead. The two eights make a catty’s weight; fifteen signifies the moon’s fullness. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"The two sevens gather to assist the human.\"* All point directly to the numerical correspondence of the same kind—neither early nor late, neither more nor less, neither large nor small, neither striving nor wrathful, neither hidden nor deceptive, neither startled nor doubtful. Only when perfectly matched do they unite in harmony.\n\nThe *\"pond’s depths\"* where the elixir coalesces echoes Master Boyang’s words: *\"The true person lurks in the deep abyss.\"* With a single thought firm and unwavering, all distractions vanish, and yin’s aberrations naturally perish. The *\"mountain’s peak\"* is how the Immortal Elder often likens the Mysterious Gate to the summit of Kunlun. When the water is clear and the moon white, one gathers the newly born numinous medicine—this is not common cinnabar or quicksilver, but true lead and true mercury, the *qi* of the sacred father and holy mother. The *qi* of common parents, following the natural course, produces humans and things; the *qi* of sacred parents, reversing the course, gives birth to immortals and buddhas.\n\n*Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected of Purple Yang, Volume One Concluded*\n*Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected of Purple Yang, Volume Two*\n*Annotations by Xue Daoguang the Purple Worthy, Lu Zhu of Ziye, and Chen Zhixu of Shangyangzi*\n\n**Eight Regulated Seven-Character Poems**\n\nWithin yang, yin’s essence lacks firmness;\nCultivating this alone only brings emaciation.\nStraining the body with exercises is not the Way;\nIngesting *qi* and consuming mist is sheer madness.\nThe world vainly seeks to subdue lead and mercury—\nWhen will they witness the dragon and tiger’s descent?\nI urge you to exhaust the source of your birth:\nReturning to the origin, reverting to the root—this is the Medicine King.\n\nDaoguang said: *\"The yin essence in the field is none other than one’s true essence. Essence generates *qi*, *qi* generates spirit—nothing sustains the body more than these. When the oil is exhausted, the lamp dies; when the marrow is depleted, the person perishes. This speaks to essence and *qi* as the very root of the body. Yet this substance belongs to yin—its nature is not firm, its tendency is to flee. Daily, it is lost through urine, sweat, tears, and saliva, easily dissipated and difficult to capture, resisting refinement and control. Without the primordial True Unity’s elixir to subdue it, there can be no coagulation or transformation. Cultivating this alone only leads to further emaciation. Straining the body with exercises is not the true path; consuming mist and refining *qi* are the ways of the deluded. Even if one swallows the sun and moon’s essence, illuminating the five viscera, or circulates the double passes, shakes the spine, replenishes the brain, and returns essence—even achieving corpse liberation, entering trance, or mastering a thousand methods—it is still only the solitary cultivation of yin within yang. Solitary yin without yang is like a hen trying to hatch an egg alone—how difficult to succeed! As Master Zhongli said: 'Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and humors—these seven substances are all yin. If one takes these as the elixir’s foundation, how can the spirit ascend to the Jade Capital?'\"*\n\nWithin the body, not only is true essence a yin substance—all five viscera and six bowels are yin, devoid of yang. Dividing heart and kidney into Kan and Li, taking liver and lung as dragon and tiger, employing spirit and *qi* as mother and child, grasping fluids and humors as lead and mercury—can this succeed? Such are the ways of the utterly foolish, who cling to these methods to cultivate the body and seek the state of pure yang. How lamentable!\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* states:\n*\"Remove cold by adding ice, dispel heat with broth.\nThe flying tortoise lacks the snake—how much more perverse!\"*\n\nEven if two maidens share a chamber, their complexions vastly different, and one sends Su Qin to mediate, Zhang Yi to broker the match, loosening their braids and wielding silver tongues to craft honeyed words, baring their hearts to harmonize—though they become husband and wife, their hair will rot and teeth decay, and still they will never know each other. This is no different from a woman marrying a woman, refining yin with yin.\n\nDaoist exercises, massage, *qi*-refinement, and mist-consumption are but minor arts, sufficient only to ward off illness. Should one cease practice even for a day, all prior effort is undone. *The Kinship of the Three* says:\n*\"The yin path scorns the nine-and-one,\ndefiling the primordial womb with turbid chaos.\nSwallowing *qi* gurgles in the stomach,\nspitting out the true to inhale external evil.\nDay and night without rest,\nceaseless from new moon to dark.\nThe body grows weary and sore,\ndazed as if deranged—\nall forced effort, far from the Dao.\"*\n\nThe true dragon and true tiger are the two eights. The true lead and true mercury are the *qi* of the two crescents. This path is utterly simple, not complex; utterly near, not distant. Yet students stubbornly cling to postnatal side doors and heterodox schools, mistaking them for dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, thus straying far afield.\n\nThey fail to consider that the immortal elders directly point to the source of these two substances—the very wellspring from which body and life arise. Returning to this root, reverting to this source, and inverting the practice will cause the true dragon and true tiger to descend of themselves, the true lead and true mercury to submit naturally. If not the sovereign of medicines, who could achieve this?\n\nSome compare the Primordial Jade Elixir to the sagely Dao, as if grasping bamboo to point at the moon—how far removed! For all postnatal things with form and substance are not the supreme medicine.\n\nMaster Ziye said: *The Book of Changes* states, *\"When male and female commingle essence, the myriad things transform and arise.\"* My own body came into being through the union of my parents’ essence. Had there been a father without a mother, or a mother without a father, how could this body exist? The essentials of elixir-making share the same vital impulse as procreation; the difference lies only in reversal or sequence. Proceeding in order gives birth to a person; proceeding in reverse gives birth to the elixir. Between reversal and sequence, heaven and earth stand as far apart as can be.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: *The Kinship* states,\n*\"This is not the method of traversing the viscera;\ninner vision is but idle thought.\nThe yin path scorns the nine-and-one,\ndefiling the primordial womb with turbid chaos.\"*\nThe arts are myriad, a thousand strands with ten thousand branches.\n\nImmortal Peng said: The world does not follow the primordial origin of the great Dao but instead pursues side doors and crooked paths—of these there are many kinds, all left-handed ways that deviate from heavenly principle, disrupt the perfection of the true, openly defy the words of the Yellow Emperor, and wholly lose the intent of Laozi. They seek eternal life but instead harm their own existence.\n\nMaster Zhongli said: *\"The gate that gives me life is the door that brings my death.\"* How profound! The superior sages have spoken, yet none among the lesser ranks can bear the burden. Why? Because the world clings to self-cultivation, and thus a thousand paths and a hundred trails are nothing but side doors.\n\nThe immortal elders, moved by compassion, directly reveal the place from which our very existence is drawn—would this not be too blatant a disclosure of heavenly mechanism? Yet people come into this world bound by karma and consciousness, and they depart the same way. The solitary yang flees and is lost; though the form is male, the body within is all yin. If one clings to the self alone in cultivation, how can one return to the origin and revert to the root? Unable to return to the origin and revert to the root, how then can one reverse yang and transform the bones?\n\nThus, the great practitioner seeks the precelestial true lead, and must seek it from the very place where one first received *qi* and was born. Only then can one obtain the precelestial true unity of *qi*, returning to the origin and reverting to the root.\n\nThis is how men and women cultivate. For women who seek immortality, the breasts are the seat of generative *qi*, and the method is even simpler. Thus, men cultivate immortality by refining *qi*, while women cultivate immortality by refining form. Women first accumulate *qi* in the breasts, then establish the cauldron and furnace to practice the Great Yin method of refining form. This path is the easiest to achieve the Dao, possessing subtle and wondrous principles.\n\nDuring the Xuanhe era, Lü Dongbin traveled to Wuxing and encountered a courtesan named Zhang Zhennu, whose beauty and grace were radiant, and whose nature favored simplicity. Though fallen among the wind and dust, each evening she bathed, changed clothes, lit incense, and prayed to heaven, earnestly seeking liberation.\n\nLü Dongbin disguised himself as a scholar and visited her. Zhang Zhennu, struck by his extraordinary bearing, held him in deep reverence. They enjoyed each other’s company to the fullest, yet the scholar departed as lightly as he had come. The next day, he returned in the same manner, and this continued for over a month—never once did they engage in licentiousness.\n\nZhang Zhennu said, “I have long been favored by your springtime visits, yet you never stay the night to share the pleasures of pillow and mat. Could it be that my humble self is unworthy of your company?”\n\nThe scholar replied, “Not so. What is truly precious is the meeting of minds—why must it be otherwise? Moreover, each night you pray to heaven—what is it you seek?”\n\nZhennu said, “Having lost myself in this life, what else could I do? Yet I reflect: since entering this profession, I have recklessly applied powder and rouge, passing falsehood for truth. I sing lewd songs and perform wanton dances, turning sorrow into mirth. This body is but a sack of foul pus, adorned with deception to ensnare others. I often lament how foolish men, failing to honor their own worth, pass through my door, captivated by my flower-like allure. Their hearts ensnared, their minds bewitched, they not only squander their wealth but often meet their ruin. Though I feign joy in these encounters, I feel the weight of my sin deeply. Thus, I pray morning and night to escape this life.”\n\nThe scholar said, “What is your aspiration? Why not cultivate the Dao?”\n\nZhennu replied, “Trapped in this place, how could I find a teacher?”\n\nThe scholar said, “I could be your teacher.”\n\nZhennu immediately bowed and kowtowed. The scholar said, “Come again, and it may be so.” Then he left.\n\nZhennu waited day and night, but he did not return. Overcome with regret, she wrote:\n\n*Met my teacher for so long,*\n*Yet not a word of truth was spoken.*\n*How I long to sit with him once more—*\n*Regret consumes me as time slips away,*\n*Leaving me now with nothing but sorrow.*\n\nBefore she could finish writing, the scholar suddenly appeared. Seeing her words, he continued the verse:\n\n*The Dao holds no clever secrets,*\n*I’ll give you the method, brother mine.*\n*At midnight and noon, sit in stillness,*\n*Guide the qi through the spine’s twin passes to Kunlun’s height.*\n*When you gain this strength,*\n*Think of me.*\n\nZhennu rejoiced greatly. The scholar then taught her the Great Yin method of refining form and the Great Elixir technique. From that moment, her spirit and *qi* flourished as if she had attained profound awakening. Unbeknownst to others, she received even more esoteric teachings, which she kept secret.\n\nBefore parting, she composed *Stepping into the Toad Palace*:\n\n*Kan and Li, Kun and Dui divide at Zi and Wu,*\n*First recognize your own ancestral root.*\n*The thunder shakes the mountain, rain descends—*\n*Wash the yellow sprout until it breaks the soil.*\n*Seize the golden essence, bind it fast,*\n*Distinguish Jia and Geng, let dragon and tiger arise.*\n*When asked who transmitted this,*\n*Say only: the master’s surname is Lü.*\n\nOnly then did Zhennu realize he was Master Lü. She feigned madness and begged in the marketplace, then retreated to a remote place to secretly practice the method. After three years, she departed through *shi jie* (corpse liberation).\n\nThe path of cultivation knows no distinction between men and women. If one’s resolve is fierce and their will unyielding, they will surely attain the Dao.\n\n*Diligently seek true lead,*\n*Lest time slip by so easily.*\n*Capture the earthly *po* to subdue cinnabar mercury,*\n*And the heavenly *hun* will naturally govern watery metal.*\n*This is how the Dao tames dragon and tiger,*\n*And how virtue commands the reverence of gods and spirits.*\n*Once you know your lifespan equals heaven and earth,*\n*No affliction will ever trouble your heart again.*\n\nDaoguang said: “True lead is the golden elixir. The earthly *po* in the outer medicine is the White Tiger; in the inner medicine, it is the golden elixir itself. The heavenly *hun* in the outer medicine is the Azure Dragon; in the inner medicine, it is one’s true essence. Cinnabar mercury in the outer medicine is the dragon’s *qi* of the waxing moon; in the inner medicine, it is one’s true *qi*. Watery metal in the outer medicine is the tiger’s *qi* of the waning moon; in the inner medicine, it is the golden elixir—also called silver in water. These all metaphorically describe the medicines of inner and outer alchemy.\n\nYet with each passing day, life wanes. We must earnestly seek a teacher and swiftly cultivate the golden elixir to transcend life and death. Capture the White Tiger to subdue the dragon, and the Azure Dragon will naturally restrain the tiger. When the two *qi* devour each other, the golden elixir is born. Then, use this elixir to capture your own true *qi*, and the true *qi* will naturally cling to the elixir, forming the sacred embryo.\n\nOnce the true dragon and tiger of the outer world are subdued, the inner dragon and tiger will submit of their own accord. When the inner refinement of spirit, *hun*, ghost, and *po* attains sanctity, the gods and spirits of the outer world will naturally revere you. Who but one whose Dao is lofty and virtue complete could achieve this? With a body transformed into pure yang, lifespan equaling heaven and earth, one roams beyond the mundane yet dwells freely in the world. All worldly thoughts dissolve—what affliction could remain?\n\nZiye said: “The earthly *po* is lead; the heavenly *hun* is mercury. Use lead to govern mercury—this is the interplay of self and other.”\n\nShangyangzi said: “Diligently seek true lead.” Pure Yang Elder said: “Begin swiftly, for even now it may be too late. Since ancient times, all sagely teachers have urged their disciples to start early, enter the chamber, and seek the true lead—a task most difficult. The poor worry they lack wealth; the wealthy worry they lack land; those with land worry they lack materials; those with materials worry they lack companions. Companions here mean external protectors.\n\nTo ‘diligently seek’ is to first gather the means, then choose a place. Thus, the Immortal Elder said: ‘At first, when there is work to be done, no one sees it.’ If the place is not suitable, others will see it, and it cannot be used.\n\nBefore I entered the chamber, I did not pay much heed to this. Only when the time came did I earnestly seek and select, realizing how difficult it truly was—how much toil it required. Thus, I understood that even ‘diligently seeking’ is no easy feat. Yet most people, after receiving a single method from their teacher, idly waste time, unaware that with each passing year, their vitality declines, and death approaches all too soon.\n\nThe earthly *po* is the very thing you seek. The heavenly *hun* is the mercury you have accumulated. The dragon of the Eastern Sea can govern the moon’s *po* of the Western River; the White Tiger of the Western River can refine the sun’s *hun* of your own house. When *hun* and *po* unite in essence, *qian* and *kun* share the same lifespan. In aiding others and engaging with the world, your virtue will grow, and even gods and spirits will revere you.”\n\nCultivate the self with an empty heart, and the Dao’s height subdues dragon and tiger. When all the dusts and leaks of Jambudvīpa are exhausted, afflictions vanish entirely. The true joy of immortals is no fleeting thing—only through skillful means does one attain great freedom, and this is the foremost accumulation of merit.\n\nYellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find, yet the enlightened must rely on deep virtue. The Four Symbols and Five Phases depend wholly on earth; how could the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams ever depart from *ren*? When the numinous essence is refined, people fail to recognize it; when all demons are dissolved, ghosts dare not intrude. Should one wish to leave secret formulas among humankind, not a single soul would prove a true confidant.\n\n**Dao Guang says:** The dragon’s string of *qi* is called white snow; the tiger’s string of *qi* is called yellow sprouts. The root of the great elixir truly lies herein. The Dao is utterly simple, its affairs not remote. Yet without grand merit and mighty deeds, one cannot encounter a true teacher to point out the profound mysteries.\n\nThe Dao arises from emptiness and gives birth to the One *qi*; the One *qi* transforms into yin and yang, called dragon and tiger. The dragon, wood, generates fire; the tiger, metal, generates water. Wood, fire, metal, and water combine to form the Four Symbols. When the Four Symbols unite, the great elixir is completed—its completion truly depends on earth. Earth has no fixed form; it divides its position among the four seasons and four times. Without the true earth of the four seasons, the four sequences cannot proceed, and how could creation arise? Thus, the Four Symbols and Five Phases rely entirely on earth.\n\n*Ren* is water, the true One *qi* born before heaven and earth, transforming into yang-dragon and yin-tiger to merge and form the elixir. The elixir is earth; the dragon is wood; the tiger is metal—these are called the Three Natures. The Three Origins do not depart from the transformation of the true One’s water. The Eight Trigrams are the true One’s *qi*: first, it transforms into heaven, called *Qian*, the father; second, it transforms into earth, called *Kun*, the mother. *Qian*, with its yang *qi*, seeks *Kun*’s yin *qi*—once sought, it gives birth to the eldest son, *Zhen*; twice sought, the middle son, *Kan*; thrice sought, the youngest son, *Gen*. This is *Qian* uniting with *Kun* to give birth to the three yang. *Kun*, with its yin *qi*, seeks *Qian*’s yang *qi*—once sought, it gives birth to the eldest daughter, *Xun*; twice sought, the middle daughter, *Li*; thrice sought, the youngest daughter, *Dui*. This is *Kun* uniting with *Qian* to give birth to the three yin. All do not depart from the transformation of the true One’s water, hence: how could the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams ever depart from *ren*?\n\nNot only do the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams not depart from the essence of the true One, but since the beginning of creation, all that has form arises from this and transforms. The cultivator who obtains the true One’s water has accomplished all things. When the true One’s water is transformed by method into the true One’s grain of millet, swallowed into the cinnabar field and fired for ten months, all yin is smelted away. The pure yang immortal of the true One—yin demons, corpse-ghosts flee with no escape. When the root of goodness is planted, the numinous bone grows; when the numinous bone grows, immortality may be hoped for. The growth of the numinous bone is the planting of the root of goodness—not in one or two lifetimes, but through countless eons, accumulating all good roots. How could one, having just emerged, already bear the ethereal air of transcending the dust?\n\nAlas! Wandering ghosts and moving corpses, with a single bottle and bowl, may wish to ascend as immortals—yet immortals are not easily attained. Why not examine one’s own heart and ask whether it differs from the common heart? My immortal affairs also have their limits. One must broadly transform and adapt, taking the Dao as one’s duty, standing alone above the world, a crane among chickens. Though people laugh at me as wild and unrestrained, I know I am no ordinary sort. Red Pine and yellow essence are my friends; Penglai and Fangzhang are my home. Naturally, one will encounter perfected beings, receive the transmission of the supreme Dao, unite with kindred spirits, and with earnest care, complete the elixir.\n\nThe immortal elder wished to leave secret teachings among humankind—yet how could he meet his Ziyu? How might one find another like myself?\n\n**Ziye says:** Yellow sprouts are the essence of lead; white snow is the *qi* of mercury. Those who seek them must possess virtue. Earth is *wu* and *ji*; *ren* is the true One’s water, the ancestral *qi* that gives life to all things.\n\n**Shangyangzi says:** Yellow sprouts and white snow are the true One’s *qi* produced within primal darkness. Earlier, it was said that true lead must be diligently sought—here, it is said that yellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find, for they depend on virtue. Foolish disciples see these two verses as contradictory, yet they do not know that without virtue, this Dao can never complete the elixir. The proverb says: “If your words are pure but your conduct is turbid, do not speak of the Dao.” One who knows the Dao but has not accumulated virtue is like a fish without water, a lamp without oil—how could the returning elixir be achieved? The Four Symbols, Five Phases, Three Origins, and Eight Trigrams have many names, yet none can do without the true One’s *ren*-water.\n\nMy Yellow Chamber Master praised the Old Immortal of Pure Yang, saying: “The crucible gathers the Four Symbols and Five Phases; the medicine follows the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams. The red phoenix spits the marrow of the southern direction; the black turtle holds the essence of the northern sea.” This is what he meant—all trace back to the verse of Pure Yang: “The crucible follows the center of the four seasons; the medicine moves with the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams.” The same idea.\n\nThough the true immortal sages and teachers are compassionate in guidance, it truly depends on one’s own conduct. Once this elixir is completed, the Jade Emperor bestows praise, and the ten thousand spirits of heaven and earth all revere it—hence its name: the Supreme Perfected Numinous Treasure, the Wondrous Nine-Return Great Elixir. Long ago, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning expounded the scriptures to save beings; the empty platform of the mysterious seat suspended a treasure pearl as large as a grain of millet—this was it. The Mahāyāna Prajñā’s nine-grade lotus dais, the luminous treasury, the wish-fulfilling wondrous Dharma, the numinous-responsive *maṇi* jewel—this was the pearl the dragon girl offered at the Vulture Peak assembly. Its preciousness cannot be described—how could the people of the world recognize it?\n\nWhen the elixir is completed, the body becomes sacred, and the yang spirit manifests—this is called the Perfected One. The yin demons and ghostly thieves transform into guardian deities; the Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior within the body, along with the three *hun*, seven *po*, Three Origins and Nine Palaces, Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries, five viscera and eight consciousnesses, all become spirits. The thirty-six thousand radiant essences transform into divine soldiers.\n\nAt that time, the Immortal Elder wished to transmit the secret oral instructions to others, yet in an entire generation, few would believe, receive, and practice them. Alas! To bow to a master while still bound in fetters—such are the disciples who come after the Apricot Grove.\n\nGrasses and trees, too, balance yin and yang;\nIf either is lacking, no fragrance will bloom.\nFirst, green leaves unfold as yang takes the lead,\nThen red flowers follow as yin comes along.\nThis is the common Way, our daily practice—\nYet who knows the true source’s reversals and turns?\n\nThe Radiance of the Dao says: Before grasses and trees sprout, they contain the purest simplicity. When their husks split, they receive the one qi to germinate, thus drawing forth a single leaf to symbolize that one qi. Next, two leaves divide to represent yin and yang, and from between them emerges another leaf to correspond to the Three Powers. Beyond this, they gradually grow lush: in spring, green leaves appear; in summer, red flowers bloom—this is the work of yang qi. In autumn, they wither and bear fruit; in winter, they die back to their roots—this is the work of yin qi. When yin and yang are balanced, generation never ceases; if either is lacking, the myriad things cannot arise.\n\nTrue Unity Master says: Solitary yin cannot generate itself; solitary yang cannot complete itself. Thus, when heaven and earth intermingle in misty vapor, the myriad things transform and harmonize. When male and female unite in essence, the myriad things are born. This is the common Way, our daily practice.\n\nAs for the true source’s reversals: there is a profound mechanism of inversion and mutual exchange. If scholars do not understand this, how can they transcend life and death?\n\nZiye says: The Way of the Golden Elixir is like the yin and yang of grasses and trees. When grasses and trees first sense yang qi, they immediately sprout buds; later, flowers follow in succession, blooming and then withering to bear fruit within. Likewise, when one obtains this single point of true yang qi, true yin naturally blends with it to form the embryo. The mutual dependence of yin and yang is generally like this—this is the common Way of daily practice. Yet where the true source reverses, it remains obscure; this is what the common people use daily yet do not know.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: Heaven produces two kinds of things—those that move and those that are still. Roots belong to the still, feet to the moving, yet all receive the yin and yang qi. Grasses and trees are still, inanimate things, yet they follow the yang spring to grow and bear fruit. Humans and creatures are moving, sentient beings—without the yin and yang qi, how could they be born and raised? Humans are the most numinous of beings, endowed with the upright qi of heaven and earth, yet they do not understand the Way of yin and yang’s waxing and waning, reversal and compliance.\n\nI now reveal it fully: when qi flows in compliance, it produces ordinary fathers and mothers; when it flows in reversal, it produces numinous fathers and sacred mothers. When the qi of ordinary fathers and mothers flows in compliance, it forms a person—this is the common Way. When the qi of numinous fathers and sacred mothers flows in reversal, it forms the elixir—this is the true source. \"Reversal\" means the male returns to being female, and the female returns to being male. Without encountering a true master, what benefit is there in mere talk?\n\nIf you do not know the inversion within the mysterious,\nHow can you plant lotuses in fire?\nDraw the White Tiger home to nurture,\nAnd bear a bright pearl like the full moon.\nDo not merely guard the furnace and watch the fire;\nSimply calm the spirit and rest in naturalness.\nWhen all yin dissolves, the elixir ripens,\nAnd you leap from the mortal cage to live ten thousand years.\n\nThe Radiance of the Dao says: By human affairs, a man cannot become pregnant, nor can lotuses be planted in fire. Yet the immortals possess the marvel of inversion, enabling a man to conceive—just as lotuses are planted in fire. The sun is *li*, male, yet reversed, it becomes female. The moon is *kan*, female, yet reversed, it becomes male. This is inversion. When these two things invert, the elixir is born; then, using this elixir to refine one’s own mercury and form the sacred embryo is like a male brother becoming pregnant—is this not inversion upon inversion?\n\nThe Dragon and Tiger are the essence of True Unity, transformed into two things, positioned east and west, yet when they emerge, they bear different names. The essence of True Unity belongs to mercury, the Green Dragon, in the east. The White Tiger is originally the child of True Unity’s essence, lodged in the west, though its home is in the east. The Immortal Elder says:\n\nGolden Duke is originally the son of the eastern house,\nSent to the western neighbor to lodge and grow.\nIf you recognize and call him home to nurture,\nPair him with the Maiden to form a bond of kinship.\n\nThus, the poem’s meaning is to draw the White Tiger home, uniting it with the Green Dragon as husband and wife to produce the bright pearl. The phrase \"like the full moon\" refers to the method of refining the elixir: first, take the half-moon from the western side at the waxing crescent to obtain eight ounces of yang metal. Next, take the half-moon from the eastern side at the waning crescent to obtain half a pound of yin water. When these two half-moons merge their qi, they generate the elixir—thus, a single grain of golden elixir resembles the full moon. This is the external medicine’s symbolic method.\n\nWhen this elixir is swallowed into one’s belly, it is called drawing the White Tiger into one’s own abdomen to pair with one’s mercury. Then, by circulating yin talismans and yang fire to refine it, the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir is formed, a single grain weighing one pound. This is the internal medicine’s symbolic method. The \"full moon\" here refers to the hexagrams of fire circulation: one hexagram has six lines, and sixty-four hexagrams total three hundred eighty-four lines, symbolizing one pound and three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. As for the external medicine’s symbolism resembling the full moon, the *Cantong Qi* says: \"The waxing crescent’s *dui* number is eight; the waning crescent’s *gen* is also eight. When the essences of the two crescents unite, the body of *qian* and *kun* is complete.\"\n\nThe two eights correspond to one pound—this is the unerring principle of the *Yi*’s Dao. The immortal master’s instruction on the full moon’s meaning aims to make Dao-seekers thoroughly comprehend the essence of creation and transformation. The two eights of inner and outer must not be conflated in discussion.\n\nFire here is not the common fire of the world, but the primordial ancestral *qi*—there is no furnace to guard. As Qingxiazi said:\n*\"The crucible is no metal crucible,\nThe furnace no jade furnace.\nFire arises from *li* below,\nWater accords with *kan* within.\nOnce the three clans unite,\nThe two substances naturally converge.\nSealed firm, the embryo does not leak—\nTransformation occurs in an instant.\"*\n\nGaoxiangxian said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth in misty union, male and female mate,\nThe four images and five phases follow in harmony.\nDay and night, *zhun* and *meng* obey nature’s law—\nWhy laboriously watch the fire’s timing?\"*\nThis is the natural furnace and fire.\n\nSimply settle the spirit and regulate the breath, harmonize the civil and correct the errant, and mark the talismanic clepsydra—without the slightest deviation. In less than half a *shi*, the elixir is immediately obtained. Then, following the advance and retreat of yin talismans and yang fire, apply the methods of withdrawal and addition, guarding against danger and peril. After ten months of work, all yin is stripped away, the body transforms into pure yang, and one leaps from the mortal cage to attain ten thousand years of longevity.\n\nThis method yields the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir, yet it has not yet entered the profound. One must further refine it for nine years, causing *qi* to return to spirit, to achieve the Nine-Turned Great Returned Elixir of Golden Liquid.\n\nZiye said: *\"Reversing yin and yang\"* means yin contains yang, and yang contains yin. *\"Planting lotus in fire\"*—fire contains water, yin contains yang, death holds life. The White Tiger is the essence of metal: white describes its nature, tiger its difficulty to subdue. The essence of metal is originally one’s own substance, but since birth, it has fled elsewhere. Now, recognizing it anew, one exerts effort to draw it back. Like the moon, like a pearl—such is the symbol of the medicine.\n\nAfter obtaining the medicine, the method of nurturing it: settle the spirit, stabilize the breath, and let it proceed naturally—this is not what is meant by rigidly guarding the elixir furnace, adding eight ounces at dawn and replacing half a pound at dusk.\n\nShangyangzi said: Yin and yang possess the mechanism of reversal; the Golden Elixir has the art of return. *\"Planting lotus in fire\"* is returning *kan* to *li*. The White Tiger is a hard-to-control substance, the *qi* contained by the Great One. Drawing it home means subduing its *qi*—the bright pearl becomes the elixir. Once the elixir is obtained, circulate one’s own mercury and regulate spirit and breath to nurture it. As *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The true person breathes from the heels.\"* Guangchengzi said: *\"The cinnabar furnace and river chariot rest idle—\nThe crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath flow on endlessly.\"*\nThis refers to the spirit’s breath.\n\nWait until yin is exhausted and yang is pure to become a true person, transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood.\n\n*\"Three, five, one\"—three words in all,\nRare indeed are those who understand through the ages.\nEast’s three and south’s two together make five,\nNorth’s one and west’s four complete it.\nWu and ji reside in the generative number five—\nThe three families meet to form the infant.\nThe infant is the one containing true *qi*;\nAfter ten months, the embryo is complete, entering the foundation of sagehood.*\n\nDaoguang said: Wood’s number is three, dwelling in the east. Fire’s number is two, dwelling in the south. Wood can generate fire, and the two substances share an office—thus two and three combine to form one five. Metal’s number is four, dwelling in the west. Water’s number is one, dwelling in the north. Metal can generate water, and the two substances share an office—thus four and one combine to form two fives. Wu and ji’s original number is five—this is the three fives. The three fives unite as one, hence *\"three, five, one.\"* From ancient times to now, those who can unite the three fives into one to form the elixir are truly rare.\n\nThe *\"one\"* is the elixir—it is the true *qi* of that, the mother of heaven and earth before their existence. My true *qi* is the child of heaven and earth. Using the mother’s *qi* to subdue the child’s *qi* is like trapping a mouse so it does not escape. The mother and child’s *qi* cherish each other within the womb, forming the infant. The so-called *\"Great One containing true *qi*\"* means containing the true *qi* of the one. Like a person carrying a child, after ten months, the saintly embryo naturally descends. When the work is complete, one naturally becomes divine and sagely—hence *\"after ten months, the embryo is complete, entering the foundation of sagehood.\"*\n\nZiye said: *\"Three, five, one\"* refers to the numbers of the five phases: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The *\"one\"* is the Supreme Ultimate. When the five phases are not united, each retains its nature; when united, they revert to the one Supreme Ultimate. If one can unite the five phases into one, one returns to primordial chaos, and the infant has its sign. Such is the wonder of the meaning of *\"the three families meeting.\"*\n\nAfter ten months, the numerical cycle is complete, the time and *qi* transform, naturally aligning with the mechanism of the ancient sages.\n\nShangyangzi said: Heaven’s three generates wood; earth’s two generates fire. Fire’s number is two, wood’s number is three—three and two share the same nature, together forming one five. Wood symbolizes the east, its image the Azure Dragon. The dragon’s *qi* is mercury fire, dwelling in the south, its image the Vermilion Bird. Wood generates fire—wood is the body, fire is the *qi* it generates, thus wood and fire are one family. Yet both are solitary yin within yang, which is why they have different names: *xuan*, *wu*, *miao*—for they possess wood and fire but lack metal, water, *wu*, and earth.\n\nHeaven’s one generates water; earth’s four generates metal. Metal’s number is four, water’s number is one—one and four share the same essence, uniting to form one five. Metal dwells in the west, its image the White Tiger. The tiger’s *qi* is lead water, dwelling in the north, its image the Dark Warrior. Metal generates water—metal is the body, water is the *qi* it generates, thus metal and water are one family. Yet both are solitary yang within yin, which is why they have different names: *pin*, *you*, *jiao*—for they possess metal and water but lack wood, fire, *ji*, and earth.\n\nHeaven’s five is *ji* earth; earth’s ten is *wu* earth. *Wu* earth dwells in *kan*; *ji* earth dwells in *li*. When *wu* and *ji* are divided, the two earths number ten; when *wu* and *ji* unite, the two earths form a *gui* and number five. Earth dwells in the center, thus becoming one five. In sum, this is the three fives.\n\nThunder-wood and fire of *li* share the same nature, forming one family. The dragon is the gate of *zhen*, and mercury is produced within. Metal of *dui* and water of *kan* share the same essence, forming one family. The tiger is the gate of *dui*, and lead is born within. *Li*-*ji* and *kan*-*wu* share the same root, forming one family. The Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior unite to generate beings. These are called the three families. The dragon and Vermilion Bird intend to give life to humans; the tiger and Dark Warrior intend to kill humans—this is the law of the world. If one wishes to transcend the law of the world, one must invert and restrain them. To what end is the merit attributed to the two earths, *wu* and *ji*? Metal naturally cherishes wood’s kindness and benevolence, yet inwardly harbors a compliant nature, and thus has no means to unite on its own. Though wood loves metal’s obedience and righteousness, it inwardly harbors a crooked and upright nature—how could it act as its own matchmaker? To bring about their union, the merit lies in the two earths, which convey their mutual affinity.\n\nMoreover, *wu* earth generates metal, desiring metal’s *qi* to flourish and mutually support one another. *Ji* is overcome by wood, so one must first refine *ji* with care to seek the elixir. If one does not refine *ji* and await the proper time, one cannot achieve constant response and stillness. Once the refinement of *ji* is complete, it unites with *wu*. When *wu* and *ji* unite, metal and wood meet. When metal and wood meet, dragon and tiger merge. When dragon and tiger merge, the three fives become one. When the three fives become one, the three families meet. When the three families meet, lead and mercury conjoin. When lead and mercury conjoin, the infant is formed. All arises from this single *qi*.\n\nThe Buddha and Patriarchs said: Within heaven and earth, between the cosmos, there is a chamber, hidden within the mountain of form. This is the marvel of the Great One containing the true *qi*. Thus, when the five phases are divided, they are called the true Dao; when the five phases unite, they generate one *qi*; when one *qi* congeals, it forms the infant; when the infant emerges, it becomes the true person.\n\nIf one does not recognize the true lead as the rightful ancestor, all efforts are vainly expended. Forsaking one’s wife only severs yin and yang; fasting only empties the stomach and intestines. Herbs, trees, gold, and silver are all impure substances; clouds, mist, sun, and moon belong to the realm of obscurity. Even if one practices breath control and visualization, all differ from the work of the golden elixir.\n\nDao Guang said: The essence of true lead lies in the two eights as its foundation; all else is not the Dao, and efforts are vainly expended. The *Song of Breaking Delusion* says: Forsaking one’s wife is not the Dao, for yin and yang lose their proper positions. Fasting is not the Dao, for one dies and becomes a hungry ghost.\n\nMaster Wang the True said: If a student stubbornly rejects wives and concubines, they fail to comprehend non-action and the action of non-action. The body of the Dao follows nature; all reckless actions—how can they be spoken of in the same breath as the golden elixir?\n\nZi Ye said: Forsaking one’s wife and fasting—what do these accomplish? Herbs, trees, gold, and silver are material things. Clouds, mist, sun, and moon are external, guest *qi*. Breath control and visualization are all delusory actions. None of these pertain to the meaning of true lead refining true mercury, and they are far removed from the Dao of the golden elixir.\n\nMaster Shang Yang said: True lead is the *qi* of the numinous father and holy mother. Without this *qi*, with what would one enter the chamber and apply effort? People born between heaven and earth receive the essence of their mundane father and the blood of their mundane mother to form their bodies. Thus, the Dao of cultivating immortality and becoming a buddha does not lie beyond this. What differs is that one must have the numinous father and holy mother to be true lead.\n\nWhat is numinous? Constant response and stillness are called numinous; inverting and applying creation is called numinous. What is holy? The initial division of the Great Ultimate is called holy; the tiger not harming humans is called holy. Only with this numinosity and holiness can one know the ancestor of true lead.\n\nWithin a person’s body, there is only so much essence and *qi*. If one exhausts them through leakage, how can the body endure? If one treasures and preserves them, the body remains healthy and life is prolonged. If one further obtains true lead and refines it, how can one not become an immortal? If worldly people lack a good teacher’s instructions to reveal the one thing, true lead, even if they practice all three thousand six hundred side doors, they will only suffer harm in vain. How could they hope for success?\n\nThe words of ten thousand volumes of immortal classics all converge: the golden elixir has only this as its root and origin. Relying on the *kun* position to generate the formed body, plant it in the *qian* household’s chamber of mutual resonance. Do not blame the celestial mechanism for being fully revealed—it is only because scholars remain deluded. If one comprehends the meaning within this poem, one will immediately behold the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Venerable.\n\nDao Guang said: The myriad alchemical classics ultimately return to one principle: all rely on the principle of the *kun* mother’s generation, reversed and cultivated, planted in the *qian* household’s chamber of mutual resonance. The immortal elders have revealed all celestial mechanisms here, yet scholars remain stubbornly deluded, unwilling to seek it within themselves to illuminate the supreme Dao and refine a single grain of millet to become a guest of heaven.\n\nZi Ye said: She is the *kun* position; I am the *qian* household. Borrowing the *qi* of generation from within *kun*, I plant the numinous root beneath my own garden to form the sacred embryo.\n\nMaster Shang Yang said: The marvel of the golden elixir does not lie beyond lead and mercury as its root and origin. If worldly people do not know that the golden elixir has a root and origin, they do not know the marvel of the inner and outer two elixirs. Establishing the furnace and setting up the tripod is external. The *qian* household and *kun* position are external. *Li*-*ji* and *kan*-*wu* are external. Metal essence and wood liquid are internal. Red lead and black mercury are internal. The primordial one *qi* is internal. Though this primordial one *qi* is said to be within, it comes from without. Thus, immortal teachers have the secret instruction of relying on another to plant it.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: Cinnabar and wood essence unite only when they obtain metal. It also says: The flowing pearl of the great yang constantly seeks to leave humans. Only when it obtains the flower of metal does it turn and follow.\n\nThis is none other than the single substance of lead-gold, yet it follows the worldly method of male and female generation, reversely planting it within the *qian* palace. Thus, Zhenyi Zi says: \"It is as when men and women become husband and wife.\" The true immortals and sagely teachers, in their compassion, have revealed and guided with utmost breadth of intention—yet this risks exhausting the celestial mechanism. How can scholars cling to shallow ignorance, persist in deluded fantasies, and multiply slander to confuse the immortal classics? Know that once the human form is lost, ten thousand kalpas cannot redeem it. One must reflect thrice, observe carefully, and receive with discernment.\n\nAh! If worldly people were not deluded, each could accomplish this matter. This book, in every place and circumstance, is guarded by a million divine soldiers—how could it be treated lightly? All companions on the Daoist path who, by karmic encounter, come upon this text: at the time of meeting, revere it, trust it, and put it into practice. Do not harbor doubt or hesitation. Cultivate it diligently, and you will swiftly ascend to the rank of celestial immortals.\n\n*Commentary on the \"Wuzhen Pian\" of the Perfected of Ziyang, Volume Two (conclusion)*\n*Commentary on the \"Wuzhen Pian\" of the Perfected of Ziyang, Volume Three*\n*Commentary by Zixian Xue Daoguang, Ziye Lu Shu, and Shangyang Zi Chen Zhixu*\n*Thirty-Two Seven-Character Quatrains*\n\nFirst fashion heaven and earth as crucible and vessel,\nThen gather the crow and hare to refine the elixir within.\nOnce these two essences are returned to the Yellow Way,\nHow could the golden elixir fail to take immortal form?\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe Classic states: \"Sun and moon are the essence of heaven and earth.\"\nThe sage compares heaven and earth to crucible and vessel,\nAnd sun and moon to the medicinal ingredients.\nHeaven and earth are the true dragon and true tiger,\nWhile sun and moon are the bowstring-qi of dragon and tiger.\nThe sage borrows names and images to establish metaphors,\nYet the essential marvel lies in the true one’s essence returning to the Yellow Way.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nI am the heavenly crucible, that is the earthly vessel.\nWhen heaven and earth cover and unite,\nThey drive the two qi to meet within the central palace.\nThen, with fire-tending and talisman-nurturing, not a hair’s breadth in error,\nHow could the golden elixir fail to arise?\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nWhat is the crucible-vessel? The numinous father and sacred mother,\nThe heavenly male and earthly female.\nWhat are the medicinal ingredients? The qi of the numinous father and sacred mother,\nThe essence of the heavenly male and earthly female.\nDriving these two substances to refine within the spirit-chamber,\nThey form the numinous elixir.\nAs the Yellow Chamber Lord said: \"With hands grasping heaven and earth,\nAnd mouth swallowing sun and moon.\"\n\nTo establish the furnace and erect the crucible, model heaven and earth,\nRefine the essence and subdue the hun and po.\nGather and disperse, wafting and billowing in transformation—\nWho would dare treat such profound mysteries as common talk?\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nAccumulate all yang qi to form heaven, which does not moisten below.\nAccumulate all yin qi to form earth, which does not flame upward.\nThis is heaven and earth not uniting—\nWithout union, how could they engender the myriad things?\nThough heaven is utmost yang, within it dwells a yin qi, so it descends to earth.\nThough earth is utmost yin, within it dwells a yang qi, so it ascends to heaven.\nThe two qi waft and billow, and the myriad things transform and mature.\nThe Way of the golden elixir—establishing the furnace and erecting the crucible,\nRefining the essence to subdue the hun and po—\nAll take their pattern from heaven and earth,\nJoining by kind to accomplish transformation.\nBeginning with being born from non-being,\nThen returning to being born from being.\nFormless yet able to transform—\nThis is called endless transformation.\nSuch is the celestial mechanism.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nTo establish the furnace and erect the crucible is to emulate heaven and earth.\nEarth above and heaven below is \"Peace\";\nHeaven above and earth below is \"Obstruction.\"\nAs for the marvel of wafting and billowing transformation—\nIts purport is subtle indeed.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nFurnace and crucible are self and other;\nHeaven and earth are male and female.\nThe qi of the numinous father and sacred mother in union is called \"essence-flower,\"\nAlso named \"flower-pool divine water.\"\nRefining with this within the mortal parents’ bodily frame to form the elixir—\nAll imitates heaven and earth’s creation.\n\nDo not cling to elixir-stoves and waste effort;\nTo refine the medicine, seek the Reclining Moon Furnace.\nIt naturally possesses the true fire-timing—\nNo need for firewood, charcoal, or blowing.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe Reclining Moon Furnace’s form opens upward like a crescent moon—\nThis is the yin sea, where the primordial ancestral qi abides.\nWhat need has it for firewood, charcoal, or blowing?\n\n*Ziye says:*\nYe Wenshu pointed to the two kidneys as the Reclining Moon Furnace—\nThis is ignorance, a misguided annotation that greatly misleads the world.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe Pure Yang Elder said: \"At Qujiang, I saw the moon’s radiance gleaming cold—\nThis is the Reclining Moon Furnace.\"\nThe Western River of the Buddhas and Patriarchs—\nAll are this single aperture.\n\nWithin the Reclining Moon Furnace, jade buds arise;\nWithin the cinnabar crucible, mercury lies level.\nOnly after harmonizing with fire’s power,\nDoes the planted yellow sprout gradually grow.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe Reclining Moon Furnace is the yin furnace.\nWithin it dwells the yang qi of jade buds—\nThe tiger’s initial bowstring-qi.\nThe cinnabar crucible is the yang crucible.\nWithin it dwells the yin qi of mercury—\nThe dragon’s initial bowstring-qi.\nWith the golden elixir’s work of harmonizing and uniting these two bowstring-qi,\nA single yellow sprout is planted, forming a grain of millet’s pearl.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe jade buds within the Reclining Moon Furnace are the yang within yin,\nThe substance within Kan.\nThe mercury within the cinnabar crucible is the yin within yang,\nThe fire within Li.\nOnly when yin and yang qi generate the yellow sprout\nDoes the elixir form.\n\nSwallowing saliva and absorbing qi—this is what people practice,\nYet only with the medicine can transformation and life arise.\nIf within the crucible there is no true seed,\nIt is like boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nSwallowing saliva and absorbing qi—many people practice this,\nYet they do not know these are all postnatal, earth-born, utmost yin substances,\nNot the prenatal qi.\nThe true one’s qi of the prior heavens dwells between indistinctness and obscurity,\nDifficult to seek, difficult to see.\nThe sage, using the method of fire’s transformation, refines it into the elixir—\nThis qi is called the true seed.\nThe Classic says: \"Subdue qi without absorbing qi;\nTo absorb qi, first subdue qi.\nAbsorbing qi does not lead to long life—\nLong life requires subduing qi.\"\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe true seed is true lead.\nThe *Contract* says: \"Plant millet when sowing grain;\nHatch chicks using their eggs.\"\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThings without yin and yang cannot reproduce.\nPeople without the true seed cannot conceive.\nSwallowing saliva and absorbing qi are one’s own yin—\nSolitary yin does not produce; solitary yang does not generate.\nOnly when yin and yang are true\nCan the true seed be obtained.\nAh! How wondrous!\n\nTo harmonize lead and mercury and form the elixir,\nNeither great nor small harms the two realms’ wholeness.\nIf you ask what true lead is—\nThe toad’s radiance shines all day upon the Western River.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nDriving the dragon causes mercury’s fire to fly and scatter;\nRiding the tiger causes lead’s light to flash and gleam.\nWafting and billowing in transformation,\nA single grain of prenatal qi forms the elixir.\nDragon great and tiger small—\nWhat harm is there in the principle of yang’s nobility and yin’s humility?\nThe toad’s radiance is the essence of metal and water.\nThe sage, on the night of the fifteenth of the eighth month,\nUnites the qi of metal and wood to congeal the true one’s essence.\nThus it is said: \"The toad’s radiance shines all day upon the Western River.\"\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe method of seeking lead to subdue mercury\nLies in harmonizing, ensuring no excess or deficiency—\nExcess may harm the other, while deficiency may fail to form the elixir.\n\nGreat and small refer to yin and yang. The *Book of Changes* states: \"The great departs, the small arrives.\" The toad’s radiance shining upon the Western River signifies metal within water.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe eldest son of Qian is Zhen, denoting greatness and governing the production of mercury. The youngest daughter of Kun is Dui, denoting smallness and governing the production of lead. When Zhen and Dui harmonize, what harm is there? \"Both states preserved\" means that since the other suffers no loss, I too may accomplish the work. True lead is born in Dui, and Dui resides in the west.\n\n\"Before refining the returning elixir, do not enter the mountains,\nFor within them, both inside and out, no lead is found.\nThis supreme treasure exists in every household,\nYet fools fail to recognize it in full.\"\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe dragon is not in the eastern sea, nor the tiger in the Western River. It exists in every household. Reverse the process and cultivate it, and the returning elixir may be hoped for.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nTo regain what was lost is called \"returning.\"\nTo bring back what has departed is called \"reversion.\"\nThe essence of elixir-making lies in nothing but lead.\nThis lead exists in every household—what a pity people do not recognize it!\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nPeople see only a stretch of wondrous mountains and fair waters and say, \"This is a fine place to cultivate the Dao.\" How many have been misled through the ages! Yet what do great rivers and secluded valleys contain? Only trees, stones, deer, and elk—all of these are not of the same kind and cannot be refined into the great returning elixir. To refine the returning elixir, one must seek the same kind. To seek the same kind, one must hide in the bustle of the marketplace. The immortal’s earlier poem already declared, \"Why must one dwell in the deep mountains, guarding solitude?\" This meaning is now made clear—how profoundly it cuts to the truth! This true lead exists in every household, in every person. Yet people pass through life as if in a dream or a drunken stupor, vaguely drifting by. Without meeting a true teacher, who would recognize it?\n\n\"When bamboo splits, it must be mended with bamboo;\nWhen a hen overturns, it must be righted with an egg.\nAll else is not of the same kind—vain effort,\nHow can one obtain true lead to match the sage’s mechanism?\"\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nIf a bamboo vessel breaks, can it be mended with metal or wood? To restore it whole, it must be mended with bamboo. If a hen is overturned, can it be brooded with earth or water? To bring forth wings, it must be covered with an egg.\n\n*Master Tao says:*\nWhen bamboo splits, mend it with bamboo;\nWhen wood breaks, patch it with wood.\nA leaking roof is covered with tiles;\nA weakened man is restored with the same kind.\nTo cultivate celestial immortality, one must seek the same kind—only then does it align with the sage’s mechanism.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nWhen the Perfected One of Purple Yang reaches this point, it is as if he advances step by step.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nFrom ancient times, divine immortals have never spoken plainly.\nTo speak plainly would invite ridicule.\nEven Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingredient Entry* conveys its meaning in just three words:\n\"Do not use common lead; if you use true lead, discard it afterward.\nThis is the true esoteric method of using lead—\nTo use lead yet not use it is the sincere teaching.\"\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nCommon lead is the impure substance of postnatal generation.\nTrue lead is the qi of the true one.\nHuman essence and qi scatter daily, never congealing to form the sacred embryo. The sage refines true lead, captures it, and subdues it, condensing it into cinnabar. Day by day, fire is applied, gradually adding mercury. As mercury’s qi increases, lead’s qi dissipates. Adding mercury and reducing lead—this is the true subtlety. After ten months, the fire is complete, the six hundred hexagrams conclude, lead’s qi ascends and disperses, leaving only a single taste of pure mercury. When lead is exhausted and mercury dried, it transforms into the golden liquid great elixir. The body becomes purely yang, its lifespan equal to heaven’s. Those who study the Dao and reach this point will know the debt to their teacher is hard to repay. They should pledge their hearts beneath the sun and moon, vowing to attain the Dao to repay their teacher’s kindness. To betray a teacher’s kindness is to betray the sun and moon.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe method of using lead is like the snare and trap for catching fish and rabbits. Fish and rabbits are caught by the snare and trap, but once caught, the snare and trap are no longer needed. It is also like smelting silver from lead—once the silver is extracted, the lead is discarded. Those who understand this principle understand how to use lead.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe *Laozi* states: \"Heaven and earth are not wholly efficacious; the sage is not wholly capable; the myriad things are not wholly useful.\" Deeply comprehending this principle reveals the meaning of using true lead and then discarding it.\n\n\"Emptying the heart and filling the belly—both meanings run deep,\nYet emptying the heart is to recognize the heart.\nBetter to refine lead first to fill the belly,\nAnd thus guard the hall filled with gold.\"\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nGuard essence to fill the belly; when the belly is full, the hall is filled with gold and jade. Embrace the one to empty the heart; when the heart is empty, not a speck of dust remains. When the heart is empty, refine lead to control it. When the belly is full, embrace the one to guard it. Both form and spirit attain subtlety, merging with the Dao in truth. Those who refine the elixir must refine lead like gold—do not disturb your essence. If essence is scant, the returning elixir will not form.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nWhen the heart is empty, thoughts are pure, and not a speck of dust remains. When the belly is full, the elixir is formed, and the four great elements are secure. With pure thoughts and the elixir formed, both form and spirit attain subtlety.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nWithout diligent self-cultivation, one cannot empty the heart of desire or fully preserve essence and cut off lust. When the work of refining lead is mastered, one cannot but fill the belly and fully preserve spirit. An empty heart is always responsive; a full belly is always tranquil. Always responsive, always tranquil—always pure and still. Today, people squander their essence and qi to the point of exhaustion because they do not recognize the heart. The immortal teaches to guard the hall filled with gold and jade—only then can one return to the root and revert to the origin.\n\n\"I dreamed of ascending to the Nine Heavens to meet the Western Flower,\nWhere the Perfected One bestowed upon me the *Finger-Pointing to the Mystery*.\nIts words were few and simple,\nTeaching only to refine mercury and lead.\"\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe Tathāgata said: \"There is but one true matter. The other two are not the path of the golden elixir.\" Apart from mercury and lead, there is no other esoteric method.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nGao Xiangxian day and night sought the truth, until unknowingly his soul ascended to the Jade Capital. The Emperor then commanded the Lady of the Western Flower and Grand Unity to instruct him in the secret of the golden elixir. In her text, she said: \"Qian and Kun are the gates of yin and yang.\"\n\nQian’s Way is male, Kun’s Way is female.\nThe people of this age know not true yin and yang,\nVainly searching heaven and earth for dragon and tiger.\n\nIt is also said:\nShu Tong took up the task, Wei Boyang led the way,\nLaughing as they entered the land of Nothing-Whatsoever.\nOnly then did *Lianshan* compose the *Cantong Qi*,\nLeft as the king of elixir scriptures for ten thousand ages.\nThe Perfected One spoke much,\nYet it all comes down to refining lead and controlling mercury.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nOne who is devoted to the Dao is a person of divine transcendence.\nEven in the space between a single breath and a single sleep,\nThey never for a moment forget,\nThus in dreams they constantly commune with perfected immortals and sagely saints.\nWhy is this?\nHeaven is without private favor, yet aids those who possess virtue.\nThe Dao arises from emptiness and nothingness to generate the One Qi,\nAnd from this One Qi, yin and yang are produced.\nYin and yang unite again to give rise to the Three Bodies,\nAnd from the Three Bodies, the ten thousand things flourish.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe Dao is fundamentally empty, yet gives form to qi.\nQi is fundamentally substantial, yet takes on formless form.\nWhen emptiness and fullness restrain each other, the One is born.\nThe One generates the Two, the Two generate the Three,\nAnd the Three generate the ten thousand things.\nThe ten thousand things all bear yin and embrace yang,\nHarmonizing through the primal qi.\nBefore form arises, the harmonious qi of the primal void cannot be seen.\nOnce emptiness takes shape, the clear qi becomes yang, the turbid qi becomes yin.\nThe two qi intermingle in misty union, their essences conjoined,\nAnd thus are born the Three Things: heaven, earth, and humanity.\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n\"Heaven and earth intermingle, and the ten thousand things are transformed into purity.\nMale and female unite their essences, and the ten thousand things are brought to life.\"\nThus the sage delves into the depths of this mystery to know its source,\nAnd exhausts its spirit to comprehend its transformations.\nTherefore, they can return to the root and revert to the origin,\nReversing and refining, inverting the workings of creation.\nThey plunder the mother qi of heaven and earth to forge the elixir,\nAnd steal the essence qi of yin and yang to serve as fire.\nThey refine form to return it to the One Qi,\nAnd refine qi to reenter the realm of emptiness and nothingness.\nThus body and Dao unite, subtly wondrous and perfectly penetrating,\nTransforming endlessly, now hidden, now manifest, beyond all reckoning—\nThis is called the Perfected Person.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe One generates the Two, the Two generate the Three,\nAnd the Three generate the ten thousand things—\nThis is the true body of the sacred embryo,\nThough a thousand or a hundred million, transformed without end.\nThus the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says:\n\"In one year, a child is born,\nAnd each one can ride a crane.\"\nThe *Mud-Pill Elder* says:\n\"In one year, a child is born of the embryo,\nAnd the child begets grandchildren, the grandchildren branch forth.\"\nAll elucidate the meaning of the Three generating the ten thousand things.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe Dao generates the One Qi, the One Qi generates form,\nAnd within form is contained the original qi—\nThis is the true primordial One Qi.\nWhen this primordial qi flows in accord, it becomes human;\nWhen it flows in reverse, it becomes the elixir.\nReversed, a man conceives the embryo;\nIn accord, a woman becomes pregnant.\nThis \"repeated generation\" refers specifically to cultivation:\nWhen the elixir is complete, the yang spirit emerges from the embryo,\nRecreating yin and yang—\nThis is what was meant above by \"the Three Bodies regenerate.\"\n\nWhen the thunder of Kan roars, the golden water flows just so,\nAnd fire erupts from Kunlun, yin and yang conjoined.\nIf these two things harmonize,\nThe elixir naturally ripens, and fragrance pervades the body.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe thunder of Kan is the bowstring qi of the tiger.\nThe tiger, with the fire within yin, illumines and melts the Qian dragon,\nAnd the dragon then emits the fire of Kunlun in response.\nWhen the fires of these two things merge and harmonize,\nThe essence of the true One naturally coagulates.\nAt that moment, gather and ingest it,\nAnd the hundred bones are all ordered, fragrant and beautiful.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe thunder of Kan is water and fire.\nMetal and water belong to the Kun direction.\nWhen water and fire clash in the Kun direction,\nGather the elixir to oneself—\nNaturally, the true One Qi pierces straight through the Niwan Palace,\nMerging with the yin qi within the body,\nAnd fragrance arises throughout.\nThe fragrance is the sign that the elixir is ripe.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe thunder of Kan is the moment when the other lead’s qi flourishes.\nI then seize the opportunity of its arrival,\nAnd emit the fire of Kunlun in response.\nThis is what is meant by \"in a month, there is but one day;\nin a day, there is but one hour.\"\nWhen fragrance permeates the cinnabar field,\nThe whole body is harmonized and at ease,\nThe eyes bright, the body strong—\nThese are the effects of obtaining the elixir.\n\nIf Li and Kan lack Wu and Ji,\nThough they contain the Four Images, no elixir is formed.\nOnly because each holds the true earth within,\nCan the golden elixir return and revert.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n\"Kan’s Wu is the essence of the moon,\nLi’s Ji is the radiance of the sun.\"\nLi’s Ji is the bowstring qi of the dragon,\nKan’s Wu is the bowstring qi of the tiger.\nThe true earth of Wu and Ji resides in these two positions.\nIf dragon and tiger lack the qi of these two earths,\nHow could they merge and cause the Four Images to gather at the center to form the elixir?\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThough Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li possess the Four Images,\nWithout the union of Wu and Ji,\nWhat seeks to return cannot return,\nAnd what seeks to revert cannot revert.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe Four Images are Qian, Kun, sun, and moon.\nQian and Kun are the bodies of Kan and Li,\nSun and moon are the images of Kan and Li,\nAnd Wu and Ji are the gates of Kan and Li.\nThe wonder lies in each holding the true earth within—\nWhat need is there for excessive deliberation?\nIf the two families do not each unite with the other’s earth,\nHow can the One Qi circulate,\nAnd how can the golden elixir return and revert?\n*Laozi* says, \"The gate of the mysterious female\nIs the root of heaven and earth\"—\nThis refers to the two earths of each other.\n\nThe sun resides in the Li position and is transformed into the female,\nWhile Kan is paired with the Toad Palace and becomes the male.\nIf you do not grasp the inverted meaning within,\nDo not presume to discourse on such lofty matters with limited insight.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe crow within the sun belongs to yin, thus it is the Li female.\nThe hare within the moon belongs to yang, thus it is the Kan male.\nTo speak without reaching this is to view the sky through a tube.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nLi and Kan are inverted—see the notes to the regulated verse.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nLi is yang on the outside and yin within—it has an exterior but no interior.\nKan is yin on the outside and yang within—it has an interior but no exterior.\nNeither attains pure yang.\nTo pair Kan with Li is called \"inversion.\"\nNowadays, learners are unwilling to devote themselves to seeking a teacher,\nInstead memorizing a few public cases of the ancients,\nAnd in large gatherings, they ceaselessly chatter,\nRelying on their quick wit to display their shallow wisdom.\n\nDo they not fear twisting their tongues to no purpose? Even with eloquence like a cascading river, it becomes but a demon obstructing the Way—all the more revealing their base and sordid learning. How then could they possess the eye of the great adept and bow to a teacher beneath the bonds of convention?\n\nThe Most High said: *\"The knower does not speak; the speaker does not know.\"*\n\nAfter obtaining the Elixir, my master, the Perfected Li of Great Emptiness, once heard a temple lecture on the sutras. Concealed among the crowd, he listened, then emerged and sighed: *\"What they speak of cannot be practiced; what we practice cannot be spoken.\"* The Immortal Elder pitied these disciples who harm themselves through profit.\n\nThus he said: *Cease empty talk of limited insight.*\n\nTake the true yang from the center of Kan’s position,\nAnd refine the yin within Li’s palace.\nFrom this, transform into the vigorous body of Qian,\nWhere hidden depths and soaring flight are all at will.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nLi has yang on the outside and yin within—it has an exterior but no interior.\nKan has yin on the outside and yang within—it has an interior but no exterior.\nUsing the inner yang to refine the inner yin yields pure Qian.\nThe Golden Elixir comes from without; it is the qi of utmost yang, called the Elixir, coalescing within the Northern Sea. By method, it is drawn forth to refine one’s own yin mercury, transmuting it into pure yang. Thereafter, the circulation of water and fire, the extraction and addition—all proceed at my command.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe yang within Kan is Qian. Qian moves and sinks into Kun, forming Kan, while Qian itself becomes Li. The method of cultivation lies in extracting that one yang from Kan and returning it to Li, restoring pure yang. Thus the method of refining the Elixir is complete.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nMaster Zhuang of Qiyuan said: The Cloud Generals of Primordial Chaos plotted to repay Hun Dun’s virtue. Each day, they bored one hole—on the seventh day, Hun Dun died. People of this world, born from a single drop of true yin and true yang from their parents, possess a body whole and undiminished. Yet by the age of sixteen, just as they have nurtured a body of pure yang, the Cloud Generals arrive: the Six Thieves assail from without, the Seven Emotions erode within. Unaware, when pure yang mingles with yin, the whole body is diminished, forming Li. When pure yin overwhelms yang, the single qi is seized, forming Kan. All ordinary people are thus exhausted. The great cultivator takes from Kan and returns to Li—this is the Way of the Golden Elixir.\n\nThe mercury of the Thunder Dragon emerges from Li’s land,\nThe lead of the Lake Tiger is born in Kan’s realm.\nThese two substances together beget mother from child;\nThe Five Phases must all enter the Central Palace.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nMercury is the Thunder Dragon, belonging to Wood. Wood generates Fire; Wood is Fire’s mother, Fire is Wood’s child—this is the ordinary sequence of the Five Phases. Yet cinnabar, belonging to Fire as Li, gives birth to mercury, meaning Fire inverts to generate Wood. Thus it is called \"child begetting mother.\" Lead is the Lake, belonging to Metal. Metal generates Water; Metal is Water’s mother, Water is Metal’s child—this is the ordinary sequence of the Five Phases. Yet black lead, belonging to Water as Kan, gives birth to lead, meaning Water inverts to generate Metal. Thus it is called \"elder begetting mother.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Great White said:\n*\"The art of inverting the Five Phases—\nThe dragon emerges from within Fire.\nNo need to traverse the Five Phases—\nThe tiger is born within Water.\"*\nThese two substances mutually generate, forming the Four Images.\nGathering at the Central Palace, uniting the Five Phases, the Elixir is congealed.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nIn general, this clarifies the Way of \"child begetting mother.\"\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nZhen is Qian’s eldest son, following his father’s will to practice the Way.\nDui is Kun’s youngest daughter, standing in her mother’s place to practice the Way.\nWhen Zhen and Dui unite, Tiger and Dragon descend;\nWhen Li and Kan merge, lead and mercury are born, and the Elixir is ingested into the Central Chamber of Spirit.\n\nThe moon, just half-bright after the sky clears,\nSoon bears the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl.\nNow is the time to cultivate the work of the two eights;\nWithin a single hour, the Elixir is complete.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe Immortal Elder’s reference to the half-moon merely illustrates the numbers of the two eights, likening them to Dragon and Tiger. The marvelous function of this Way lies within a single hour, divided into six intervals—yet the Golden Elixir is established in just two. The remaining four intervals hold other wondrous uses. These are all celestial mysteries, difficult to inscribe on bamboo and silk, transmitted only through oral instruction and heart-to-heart transmission.\n\nFools without a true teacher claim the medicine is completed in a single hour, not realizing it requires but a single hour. How utterly deluded! The common man, lost and without direction, privately conjectures—how grievously mistaken! To say it requires more than an hour is to extend it to days and months, yet this is the most wondrously simple and easy method.\n\nThis Way is not to be heard in the world of men; only those of great virtue and goodness may seek to inquire into it.\n\n*Jin’s note on* The Fire Record of the Great Elixir *says:*\nWhen the sage begins the work, at the inception of refining lead, he steals the qi of the Primordial One’s celestial cycle, seizing the correct tally of thirty million seventy-three thousand years. Gathering it within the cauldron of Qian and Kun, uniting it at the convergence of generation and destruction, he exhausts the tally of Heaven and Earth, the tally of sun and moon, the tally of Dragon and Tiger, the tally of yin and yang and the Five Phases, the tally of generation and completion. Capturing it all within a single hour, he forges a single grain of the Sacred Elixir, as large as a millet seed, weighing one pound—most numinous, most sacred, most honored, most noble. It is the primordial essence of Heaven and Earth, the master of the body’s destiny. Truly, it is to plunder Heaven and Earth, to steal yin and yang, to hold the cosmos in one’s hand, to give birth to the myriad transformations within the body. Attaining the rank of Perfected Immortal, one becomes a guest of the Emperor on High. Thus the Elixir’s completion in a single hour is its proof.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nWhen the medicine is born, it is like the moon emerging at geng and reaching ding—this is the qi-moment of half a catty of metal at the first quarter. At this time, yin and yang meet, easily uniting. By the fifteenth day, the Three Yangs are complete. When it reaches jia in the East, the moon has ascended as a full wheel, the qi-moment of two eights of Qian Metal.\n\nWhen scholars know this moment and cultivate accordingly, within this single hour the Golden Elixir may be accomplished.\n\n*Master Shangyang says:*\nAs the moon first appears at the horizon, it receives the sun’s faint yang—this is the moment when the tiger roars and *gui* is born, the primal beginning of precelestial qi. Seize the time when it comes; if the furnace is damaged, recovery is difficult.\n\nThe Old Immortal of Ziyang speaks with ever-greater urgency here, fearing that later generations may fail to attain immortality. Yet foolish and benighted men spend their days discoursing on the Dao, the blind leading the blind. They know not what is meant by the dragon’s chant or the tiger’s roar, nor that the work hinges on this single hour. Ignorant of all, they slander the Old Immortal’s words as “Three Peaks sexual arts,” and thus their sins only deepen.\n\nNow, what is this hour?\nAh! Seek not *zi* and *wu* at the far horizon—\nCount *kun* and *shen* first upon your own body.\nOn Mount Huayue’s peak the male tiger roars;\nIn Fusang’s depths the female dragon chants.\nThe Yellow Dame herself knows how to mediate,\nSending them forth as husband and wife with one heart.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nMount Huayue is the western mountain where the moon rises, symbolizing the tiger. The male tiger is the tiger’s first-quarter qi, yang within yin—hence “male tiger.” Fusang is where the sun rises, symbolizing the dragon. The female dragon is the dragon’s first-quarter qi, yin within yang—hence “female dragon.” Though these two are separated by east and west, the Yellow Dame enables their union as husband and wife, giving birth to the Yellow Sprout.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nWhen *kan* is above and *li* below, harmonized by the intent of central equilibrium, tiger and dragon love each other as husband and wife. “Yellow” signifies the center; “Dame” is the term for a woman’s elder years, thus free from jealousy and able to mediate. The meaning of the Yellow Dame is fully expressed in central harmony.\n\n*Master Shangyang says:*\nThe male tiger on the mountain’s peak is perilous and difficult to subdue; the female dragon in the sea’s depths is treacherous and difficult to tame. Without great power and great courage, how can one master them? Even the Golden Elixir is a supremely yang qi dwelling within the unfathomable and perilous—difficult to obtain, difficult to gather. Without accumulating thick virtue and refining the self to purity, how could one apply the work and attain it?\n\nNow, how can they be made to share one heart?\nAh! If you seek the treasure of heaven,\nYou must use the wealth of the world.\nThe White Tiger of the western mountain is wild and unruly;\nThe Azure Dragon of the eastern sea cannot be withstood.\nSeize them with both hands and make them fight to the death,\nTransforming into a lump of purple-gold frost.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nMaster Haichan said:\n“With the left hand seize the Azure Dragon’s head,\nWith the right hand grasp the White Tiger’s tail,\nBring them together and swallow them at once—\nHow sweet this thing is to contemplate.”\nThis speaks of external imagery. The foolish, having never heard the supreme Dao, take it to mean seizing the two beasts with both hands—yet this is not so.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe White Tiger of the western mountain is the metal essence within *kan*; the Azure Dragon of the eastern sea is the wood nature within *li*. These two are fierce and unruly, not easily captured. If one obtains the method to restrain them, they harmonize and transform into the Elixir. This “death” holds profound principle. As the diagnosis says: “To seek life’s wealth and nobility, one must apply the work of death.”\n\n*Master Shangyang says:*\nThe tiger has the potential to harm—one must consider how to subdue it. The dragon has the danger of fleeing—one must consider how to tame it. Now, how are they subdued and tamed? How do they fight to the death?\nHmph! Seal the three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth—do not let them communicate.\nThe Perfected One hides in the deep abyss,\nFloating and roaming, guarding the compass within.\nThe Red Dragon and Black Tiger, each to west and east,\nThe Four Images intersect at *wu* and *ji*.\nFrom this *fu* and *gou* can be employed,\nWho says the Golden Elixir cannot succeed?\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nWhen the Red Dragon and Black Tiger meet at *wu* and *ji*, they produce a grain of Elixir, which is returned to the Central Palace. Advance the yang fire in the *fu* hexagram, withdraw the yin water in the *gou* line, apply the work of drawing out and adding—thus the Golden Elixir is accomplished.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nDragon to the west, tiger to the east—thus they are separated. To make them meet, one must rely on *wu* and *ji*. Once they unite, they give birth to the purple-gold Elixir, and the fire is nurtured through the work of *fu* and *gou*.\n\n*Master Shangyang says:*\nMy teacher, Master Zhao, once saw a man who spent all day discoursing on the Dao, claiming to have met a master who had enlightened him. My teacher bowed before him and asked: “I dare not ask about the Dao—only, what are the dragon and tiger?”\nThe man said: “The dragon and tiger are within your own body.”\nMy teacher said: “What do they look like?”\n\nThe man said: \"They are the liver and lungs.\"\nMy teacher said: \"You ought to be cast into the Hell of the Torn-Out Tongue to receive your retribution—never again deceive people in this world.\"\n\nNow, Master Ziyang has pointed out the dragon and tiger with utmost clarity: what belongs to me is the dragon, what belongs to the other is the tiger. With this distinction of self and other, they are said to be in the west and east. The dragon’s head is *ji*, the tiger’s gate is *wu*. Through them, dragon and tiger unite; through this, *fu* and *gou* are set in motion, and the Golden Elixir achieves its completion.\n\nAh! To know this is not difficult—only to practice it is hard.\n\nFirst, observe heaven to discern the Five Thieves; next, examine earth to pacify the people. Only when the people are at peace and the nation is prosperous may one seek battle; only after battle is concluded may one behold the Sage.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nHeaven harbors Five Thieves—those who see them shall prosper. If one can perceive them and practice reversal, then the cosmos lies within one’s grasp, and the myriad transformations arise within the body.\n\nTo examine the principle of earth, one must first pacify the people. The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is secure, the state is at peace. The Sage takes the body as the state, essence as the people, fire as the minister, and the Elixir as the ruler.\n\nWe observe heaven with the heart, capture the Five Thieves and practice reversal, plunder yin and yang to set transformation in motion—then the true unity of essence may be seized, and the mercury of *qian* and the yin of *kun* are secured. When essence is firm and qi complete, one will surely triumph in battle and behold the Sage.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nHeaven is the heart. The Five Thieves are the five natures of the Five Phases within the heart. Each of the Five Phases possesses its own nature, and thus they mutually ravage one another—all original qi becomes plundered.\n\nMetal governs anger, wood governs joy, water governs coolness, fire governs heat, earth governs stillness—these are the natures of the Five Phases. One who can perceive these thieves will have a heart free of stray thoughts, a body like the Great Void.\n\nEarth refers to the entire body. The essence, qi, and spirit within the body are the people. When essence is whole and qi robust, this is called \"the people at peace.\" When the Four Great are healthy, this is called \"the nation prosperous.\" Only when the nation is prosperous may one engage in battle and achieve victory.\n\nIf this heart is overrun by wild thoughts and the root of this body is not firm, thieves will swarm like bees, essence will dissipate, and qi will scatter. To go into battle thus is to court destruction—how could one ever behold the Sage?\n\nThis chapter concerns the work of refining the heart, tempering the self, and laying the foundation.\n\n*Master Shangyang says:*\nThe Way of the Golden Elixir first requires tempering the self, so that spirit is whole and qi abundant, the Seven Emotions unmoved, the Five Thieves unchaotic, the Six Roots utterly purified, and essence unshakable—this is what is meant by \"thieves do not raid a poor household.\"\n\nIn the discourse on the Elixir Way, the Five Thieves are: the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and intent as the Five Thieves of heaven; form, sound, fragrance, flavor, and touch as the Five Thieves of the world; love, desire, greed, wrath, and delusion as the Five Thieves within.\n\nIf the Five Thieves of heaven are not guarded within, the Five Thieves within will swarm. If the Five Thieves of the world are not expelled without, the Five Thieves of heaven will multiply like jackals.\n\nThus, when the eye sees form, love arises and plunders essence. When the ear hears sound, desire arises and agitates essence. When the nose smells fragrance, greed arises and depletes essence. When the mouth tastes flavor, wrath arises and scatters essence. When the body and intent encounter touch, delusion arises and harms essence. These five, day and night, ravage the body—how much essence can remain? Once essence departs, spirit and qi follow in its loss.\n\nThe cultivator takes the body as the state and essence and qi as the people. When essence is unshaken, this is called \"the people at peace\"; when spirit and qi are abundant, this is called \"the nation prosperous.\" Seeking the Elixir is like waging war; the primordial unity of qi is the Sage.\n\nTo temper the self is to eliminate the harm of the Five Thieves, first guarding essence and nurturing qi—only then can one triumph in battle and attain the true unity of the primordial qi.\n\nThe Immortal Master uses battle as a metaphor to instill fear and caution. The foolish, failing to understand the harm of tempering the self and expelling thieves, misconstrue these references to seeking battle, employing generals, and underestimating the enemy as the doctrine of \"Three Peaks\" dual cultivation, leading to inextricable confusion.\n\nAh! The foolish remain foolish; the wise remain wise.\n\nWhen employing generals, distinguish between left and right armies. Though the other may be the host, I am the guest.\n\nI urge you: when facing battle, do not underestimate the enemy—lest you lose our priceless treasure.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe general is fire. The left is civil fire; the right is martial fire.\n\n\"Though the other may be the host\" means the host is yang and masculine, fond of contention, while the guest is yin and feminine, fond of stillness. For me to be the guest is to embrace the feminine without masculinity, to maintain stillness without contention—this is the mindset of caution, vigilance, and awe. The art of war says: \"Wait at ease for the weary; use stillness to control motion.\"\n\nThe application of the Way lies in fire; the application of fire lies in the person. First, set the water clock to distinguish *zi* and *wu*.\n\nNext, harmonize yin and yang to establish the foundation of transformation. Deploy the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin tally and drum the twenty-four qi’s yang fire. The Celestial Gate rests in the hand; the Earthly Axis turns from the heart. Revolve the seventy-two seasonal nodes’ crucial ford, gathering them into the crucible. Seize the three hundred sixty days’ upright qi, converging it within the embryo. Apply the method with precision; withdraw and replenish in proper sequence. When in motion, guard against peril and contemplate danger—dare not deviate by even a hair’s breadth. Externally, align with yin and yang’s tally; internally, generate the True One’s body. Should one’s mind stray in carelessness or the seasonal nodes diverge, the Alchemical Maiden may flee, the numinous embryo fail to coalesce, and the priceless treasure of the Returned Elixir be lost—just as facing battle without embracing the feminine and underestimating the enemy.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nUsing the military general as analogy: weapons are instruments of harm, yet skillfully employed, they may preserve life. To treat battle lightly or dismiss the enemy ensures defeat and ruin. When gathering the medicine, divide into left and right armies as with the enemy and oneself. I am the left army; the other, the right. Move with circumspection, reverence, and solemnity—allow not even the slightest breach of discipline, that the treasure may be preserved whole.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe left is the self; the right, the other. \"Though the other may be the host, I am the guest\" means the other stands above while I remain below, the other seeks motion while I seek stillness. The immortals’ masters speak of elixir-seeking through military analogy: a single moment’s carelessness invites defeat—how could one treat it lightly? The Ninefold Return of the Golden Elixir transpires within half a *shi*, as creation’s forces contend and tiger and dragon wage war. Seize the creative power of Heaven and Earth’s dominion, seize the creative power of the undivided Supreme Polarity, seize the creative power of Qian and Kun’s union, seize the creative power of yin and yang’s unfathomable interplay, seize the creative power of water and fire’s balanced harmony, seize the creative power of the Five Phases’ mutual conquest, seize the creative power of the myriad things’ generation—all converging in an instant to seek the one primordial qi and refine it into the Elixir. How could one not proceed with utmost caution? Thus this chapter specifically illustrates the outer elixir’s symbolic resonance. Should one attain the outer elixir, the immortal’s work is complete—this is the warning against underestimating the enemy in battle. For the cultivator, to accomplish this single feat is to declare the task arduous. The Returned Elixir is indeed the most difficult of all, as the Tathāgata said: \"The World-Honored One speaks of this difficulty—it is most difficult indeed.\" Should one slight the enemy even slightly, failing to guard against the seven emotions or six thieves, the radiant and most refined treasure of the self will be lost—how could one dare underestimate?\n\nFire is born of wood, its edge concealed;\nWithout skill in drilling, force not the attack.\nDisaster arises from this self-harm—\nSeek the Metal Lord to subdue it.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nFire born of wood brings calamity when unleashed. Essence born of the body, when stirred, must leak. Without skill in drilling, disaster harms the self.\n\n*Lü the Realized says:*\nFire erupts from seven gates—secure them tightly,\nLest it burn through the River Chariot’s path.\nThis is why one must seek the Metal Lord to subdue it.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nWithin wood lies fire, inherently bearing this destructive force. Should it erupt, the wood must burn. The pivot of life and death hangs by a thread. The common folk, ignorant of this, drift into dissipation and perversion. The sage, perceiving fire’s imminent eruption, restrains it with water—thus fire cannot cause harm.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nWood symbolizes this body, which grows day and night, and the essence-qi returns to it. In the prime of life, one’s essence-qi flourishes, and the calamity of desire arrives—impossible to subdue. To subdue it, one must first obtain primordial true lead. Yet without a true master’s guidance on the authentic lead’s source and sequence, do not act rashly.\n\nThe Metal Lord is originally the Eastern House’s child,\nSent to the Western Neighbor to lodge and grow.\nRecognize and summon him home to nurture—\nPair him with the Alchemical Maiden as kin.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe Golden Elixir’s workings manifest in myriad symbolic resonances: yang within yin that reverts to yang and then yin again, yin within yang that reverts to yin and then yang again. There are inner and outer medicines’ yin and yang, inner and outer three natures, inner and outer Five Phases and four images. There is also the interplay of inner and outer yin and yang. The symbolic resonances reverse and repeat, beyond description. We who have received the profound teaching must not waste time.\n\nZiye says: This chapter shares the same essential meaning as the earlier one on drawing forth the true essence from the Kan position.\n\nShangyangzi says: Zhen is the Eastern House, Dui is the West. To seek the Dui position, do not stray from *ren*. Only thus is true recognition and return achieved—yet do not treat the summoning lightly. Once summoned, the most critical step is the return to the dwelling. Alas, every stage is a matter of utmost difficulty; how dare one act recklessly, or speak carelessly?\n\nThere exists in the world a breed of hell-bound seeds who, the moment they open their mouths, prattle of Chan and Dao, deceiving others until death without ever repenting—how could they possibly grasp the words of Chan Master Yuanwu? Yuanwu says:\n\n*If the soles of your feet are not vast, your Chan—though Chanless—is true Chan, like a hare with child. If the crown of your head shines with fivefold radiance, your Dao—though Daoless—is true Dao, like a clam holding the bright moon.*\n\nIs this not the very wonder of recognizing, summoning, and returning home?\n\n*The Alchemical Maiden wanders with her own direction—\nThe forward path must be short, the return long.\nWhen she comes back, she enters the Yellow Dame’s dwelling,\nTo wed the Golden Elder as her old lord.*\n\nDaoguang says: The Alchemical Maiden is mercury. Her wandering with direction pertains to the workings of the outer medicine. At the outset of elixir refinement, when the mercury fire is moved for less than half a watch, true essence is obtained and consumed—this is the forward path that must be short. After ingesting the elixir, when one moves the fire of one’s own mercury, there follows the labor of ten months—this is the return that must be long. The Yellow Dame is the inner image, the earthen crucible. The Golden You is true lead; the Old Lord is pure yang.\n\nZiye says: The Alchemical Maiden is one’s own yin mercury. She moves forward in sequence, then returns in reversal. Moving forward, she is submerged in the other in the space of a moment; returning in reversal, she flows upward from below, circulating through the entire body, descending into the Central Palace to unite with lead and form the sacred embryo.\n\nShangyangzi says: The Alchemical Maiden is one’s own essence. Her wandering with direction refers to the well-trodden path of essence’s movement. In ordinary people, essence is often deficient; whenever arousal occurs, it agitates the bones and marrow of the entire body, stirring the very essence within. As desire stirs, the Heart Monarch is also led astray; the Three Corpses surge above, the Seven Po drive below. Only then does essence ascend from the two meridians, rise through the five viscera to the Mud Pill Palace, descend with the marrow, pass through the twin passes of the spine to the outer kidneys, and engage in union—this is the method of the Five Turbidities world, the wandering with direction of the common Dao, the forward movement of the ordinary path.\n\nThe Golden Elixir is not so. It follows the method of inversion, the Way of reversal. The great practitioner, having refined the self to purity, remains unmoved in body and mind; the hun and po are subdued, desire does not intrude, and essence and qi are full and abundant—like a suddenly wealthy household, where gold and jade are found everywhere. When that first yang stirs, and primordial true lead arrives, the essence and qi of one’s entire body remain still. One merely moves a single point of true lead from the nearest place below the inner kidneys to meet it—this is the forward path that must be short. Once true lead has crossed the Magpie Bridge to unite, it ascends with the winch of the Three Carts, passing through the twin passes of the spine to enter the Mud Pill Palace, suffusing the Nine Palaces, filling the two eyes, descending the Golden Bridge, passing through the Double Towers, and entering the Crimson Palace for refinement. This is the wandering with direction, the return that must be long. Then, returning to the Yellow Court’s divine chamber, it conjoins to form the elixir—this is entering the Yellow Dame’s dwelling to wed the Golden Elder, the inversion of the Five Phases and the reversal of cultivation.\n\nAfter ten months of gentle nurturing, the true person is perfected, attaining a lifespan equal to heaven—this is the Old Lord. The immortal masters have explained the sequence so clearly; the annotations of other schools are all cursory and vague, for they dared not reveal the secrets. I wish for all people in the world, for the countless millions of future generations, to achieve immortality and Buddhahood by this means—I am willing to bear the blame for this revelation. May the true immortal sages above and the gods and spirits of heaven and earth bear witness.\n\n*Though you may know cinnabar and black lead,\nWithout the firing times, it is all in vain.\nIt all depends on the power of cultivation—\nA hair’s breadth off, and no elixir is made.*\n\nDaoguang says: In the creation of the Golden Elixir, a hair’s breadth of error leads one a thousand miles astray. The sages transmit the medicine but not the fire; the firing times have always been known by few.\n\nZiye says: Even if you recognize true lead and true mercury, without the firing times, the sacred embryo will not form. Why? Because the nature of fire is warmth, and it alone can fuse the true substances, enabling their union. Without fire, lead remains lead, mercury remains mercury—each stays apart.\n\nShangyangzi says: The cauldron, the medicine—these the immortal masters have revealed completely in their poems. Only the firing times are not committed to writing, for they must be transmitted orally by a master. Without the master’s oral instruction, even if one knows the medicine, the elixir will not be achieved. Moreover, the firing times proceed through several stages in sequence—how could a fool’s wild guesses comprehend them?\n\n*The *Cantong Qi* discusses the true elixir,\nBut does not set the firing times in writing.\nTo know the wondrous subtleties of the oral instructions,\nYou must discuss them in detail with an immortal.*\n\nDaoguang says: The *Fire Records* contain six hundred chapters, each resembling the others, in harmony with heaven’s measure. What heaven conceals, the sages do not transmit. If you encounter a true master, investigate thoroughly.\n\nZiye says: The firing times are crucial to the elixir—without a master, do not guess recklessly.\n\nShangyangzi says: There are outer firing times and inner firing times. The ancient immortals and sages wrote ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures, yet none pointed to the firing times—daring not leak the heavenly treasure. Now I reveal the inner and outer firing times, wishing that later learners may all become immortals.\n\nMaster Boyang says: *\"On the third day, the moon emerges at geng.\"* This refers to the outer firing times. Master Cui says: *\"Heaven responds to the stars, earth to the tides.\"* These are the outer firing times. Master Chunyang says:\n\n*When the first yang stirs,\nAt midnight when the clepsydra runs long,\nThe lead crucible warms gently,\nIts light piercing the curtains.*\n\nThe above are the outer firing times. Such expressions seem clear and explicit.\n\nGuangchengzi says:\n*\"Abandon the toil of the elixir furnace and river chariot,\nThe crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath flow on of themselves.\"*\nThese are the inner firing times.\n\nThe Immortal Master’s poem says:\n*\"Do not vainly guard the medicine furnace to watch the firing times,\nBut let the spirit’s breath follow nature.\"*\nThese are the inner firing times.\n\nBefore refining the elixir, the most difficult to obtain is the outer firing times—this is the work of deliberate effort and foundational practice. The inner firing times, however, come after the elixir is obtained, simply following nature’s spontaneity. This is the great rest, the effortless achievement of non-action.\n\n*\"On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—\nJust when the golden essence is at its peak.\nWhen the first yang stirs,\nHasten to advance the fire without delay.\"*\n\nDaoguang says: On the fifteenth of the eighth month, the qi of Metal and Water is abundant, and the first yang begins to rise again. This is the Zi hour of heaven, when both inner and outer firing work should be swiftly advanced.\n\nZiye says: The golden essence is at its peak like the moon on the fifteenth night of the eighth month. The moon is Metal, and Metal flourishes in You. The eighth month corresponds to You, so this metaphor teaches that one should advance the fire at this time, not waiting until it waxes too full and then wanes.\n\nShangyangzi says: When Water is clear and Metal flourishes, the toad and moon in the sky shine brightly. When lead encounters the birth of Gui, the medicine in the human realm may be refined. Just as the first yang stirs, do not delay—lest the lead crucible gradually wane and one’s spiritual efforts be spent in vain. The Immortal Master’s poem here speaks of the outer firing times in this way.\n\n*\"When the first yang stirs at the time of elixir-making,\nThe lead crucible warms gently, its light piercing the curtains.\nAt the moment of receiving qi, it is easily obtained,\nBut in withdrawal and replenishment, beware of danger.\"*\n\nDaoguang says: At the Zi hour of the first yang, within the elixir crucible, true lead receives the fire, and its light pierces the curtains. Once the elixir is within for ten months, in the work of withdrawal and replenishment, one must guard against danger.\n\nZiye says: The learner should seize the moment when the first yang stirs to make the elixir. When the lead crucible’s light arises, true qi is easily obtained. Yet when it retreats into concealment, one must be especially cautious in withdrawal and replenishment.\n\nShangyangzi says: Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *\"Receiving qi is auspicious; guard against it becoming inauspicious.\"* The meaning is the same.\n\n*\"The mysterious pearl takes form and follows the bowels to grow,\nAs yang reaches its peak, yin arrives and gradually strips away its form.\nWhen the frost flies in the tenth month, the elixir is finally ripe—\nEven gods and ghosts must stand in awe.\"*\n\nDaoguang says: \"Taking form\" means that at the winter solstice, one follows the growth of yang to advance the yang fire, and at the summer solstice, retreats with the yin tally. By the tenth month, when stripping is complete, the returned elixir is finally ripe.\n\nZiye says: The \"mysterious pearl\" is the image of the medicine. The medicine cannot generate itself but must respond to the yang qi to arise. From the subtle to the manifest, as yang reaches its peak, yin recedes. When the ten-month cycle is complete, the great elixir is accomplished.\n\nShangyangzi says: This speaks of the inner elixir’s symbolic process, the work of withdrawal, replenishment, and gentle nurturing. The *Essentials of the Golden Elixir* describes the work of withdrawal, replenishment, and gentle nurturing in great detail.\n\n*\"After the first quarter and before the last,\nThe medicine is balanced, its qi and image complete.\nGather it and return to the furnace to refine,\nRefining through gentle nurturing, it cooks of itself.\"*\n\nDaoguang says: By the thirtieth day of the month, the yang soul of Metal is entirely dispersed, and the yin essence of Water fills the wheel—thus it is pure yin. Without light, it resembles Kun, hence called \"dark.\" On the two days of darkness and new moon, the sun and moon conjoin, rising and setting together. By the second day, the moon is impregnated by the sun’s light. On the third, a single yang appears at the Kun direction Geng—within the po, the hun is born, resembling Zhen. At this time, the golden qi in the human body first stirs, and the medicine’s sprout is new. On the eighth day, the second yang arises, resembling Dui. At this time, the po contains half the hun, and it is level as a string—hence called the \"first quarter.\" The period before the quarter belongs to yang, and after to yin. Within yin, yang is half—one obtains eight taels of Metal within Water, its flavor balanced, its qi and image complete. On the fifteenth day, the three yangs are complete, resembling Qian. At this time, the yin essence of po is entirely consumed, and the yang soul of hun fills the wheel—thus it is perfectly round, pure yang without yin, hence called the \"full moon.\" When yang reaches its peak, yin is born. On the sixteenth day, a single yin arises within the wheel, and within the hun, the po is born—resembling Xun. On the twenty-third day, the second yin arises, resembling Gen. At this time, the hun contains half the po, and it is also level as a string—hence called the \"last quarter.\" The period before the quarter belongs to yin, and after to yang. Within yang, yin is half—one obtains half a catty of Water within Metal, its flavor balanced, its qi and image complete. The sage gathers these two eights, seizing them within the furnace of creation, refining and nurturing gently to complete the returned elixir. The Immortal’s verse here repeatedly exhorts, ensuring one’s single-minded focus. The \"cooking\" indeed holds a wondrous meaning.\n\nZiye says: After the first quarter and before the last, following the union of sun and moon, when the great yin is about to be reborn, the medicine’s material is fresh, possessing its balanced flavor. One must swiftly gather it, congealing it with the yin mercury within the body. Beginning with gentle nurturing and ending with cooking, when this elixir is ripe, it will naturally become clear.\n\nShangyangzi says: The Immortal Master’s poem intends to show that when the medicine arises at the time of the first yang’s stirring, one should refine it, just as the great yin receives the newly born qi to complete the golden elixir. Xue and Lu’s annotations agree; those who take the first quarter as the upper quarter and the last quarter as the lower quarter are mistaken.\n\n*End of the Third Scroll of the Third Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang*\n\n*Beginning of the Fourth Scroll of the Third Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang*\n\nThe Purple Worthies—Xue Daoguang, Lu Zi of Ziye, and Chen Zhixu of Shangyang—annotate thirty-two heptasyllabic quatrains:\n\nThe eldest son first drinks the wine of the western quarter,\nThe youngest daughter first blooms the flower of the northern land.\nShould the Blue Maid meet them thereafter,\nAll at once the lock is sealed within the Yellow House.\n\nDaoguang says: *Zhen* is the eldest son, that is, the Dragon.\n*Dui* is the youngest daughter, that is, the Tiger.\nThe northern land is the yin substance; the flower is yin qi, called yin fire.\nThe Blue Maid is the Alchemical Maiden, the Dragon’s bowstring qi, called mercury fire.\nThe cultivator of the elixir drives the Dragon to approach the Tiger at once;\nthe Tiger opens the flower of the yin gate to meet the Dragon.\nWhen the Dragon stirs the mercury fire to join with the White Tiger,\nafter their meeting, the seal is fastened within the Yellow House,\nto give birth to the golden elixir and become a Perfected One.\n\nZiye says: On the third day, the waning moon appears, as *Zhen* yang arises in *Kun*-ding.\nMetal and fire are fundamentally the yin qi of *Kun*.\n*Zhen* is the returning yang, which consumes the yin qi of *Kun*,\nhence the metaphor of the eldest son first drinking the wine of the western quarter.\nThe place to which *Zhen* comes is the position of *Dui*;\nin this place, yang arises and dissolves the yin qi,\nhence the metaphor of the youngest daughter first blooming the flower of the northern land.\n“Blooming” means “issuing forth,” and the flower is yin qi—\nas in the earlier line, “after the red flower of yin secondarily issues forth.”\nThe Blue Maid is the wood-mercury.\nAt precisely this moment, *Kan* and *Li* unite in marriage;\nthe medicine is gathered and returned to the self, sealing the Central Palace.\n\nShangyangzi says: Drinking wine in the western quarter denotes the positions of male and female as east and west.\nBlooming flowers in the northern land refers to the body’s departure from the names of south and north.\nDaoguang has already revealed this in the preceding lines,\nand Master Lu again discloses it afterward—\nthose who hear and receive this should believe it and be cautious.\n\nWhen the moon of Hare and Rooster arrives in its season,\nthe form and virtue approach the gate, mirroring the medicine.\nAt this point, the golden sand should be bathed;\nif fire is added instead, peril will surely follow.\n\nDaoguang says: Two is virtue, eight is punishment.\nAt the time of bathing, fire should not be added.\nZiye says: The method of refining the elixir is this—\nwhen yang prevails, advance the yang fire; when yin prevails, nurture the yin tally.\nFire and tally follow their waxing and waning; this is an unalterable principle.\nThe months of Hare and Rooster—*mao* and *you*—are the times of spring and autumn equinox,\nwhen yin contains yang and yang contains yin.\nThus, at this time, one dares not advance the fire,\nbut only steams with true qi to perform the bathing, preserving against danger.\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: In the eighth month, wheat sprouts—\nyin contains the qi of life.\nIn the second month, the elm withers—\nyang contains the qi of destruction.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: Punishment is destruction, virtue is achievement. Punishment is peril, virtue is nurturance. Once golden sand resides in the crucible, it must be warmed, nourished, and sustained. Even the Perfected One of Purple Clarity lamented the smoke filling the cavernous chamber—how could one not be cautious?\n\nSun and moon meet once every thirty days; the method of exchanging days for hours governs the divine work. Whether guarding the city or waging wild battle, one discerns fortune and misfortune—adding to the numinous sand until the crucible brims with crimson.\n\nDaoguang says: The Great Yang and Great Yin conjoin once a month. The sages modeled this, condensing a day into an hour, exchanging months for days and days for hours. When guarding the city, one bathes and ceases the work; in wild battle, tiger and dragon mate. The divine work refers to the measure of advancing fire. If yin and yang are disordered, sun and moon discordant, though the external fire moves, the internal tally does not respond. The secret essentials of advancing fire and retreating water—knowing fortune and misfortune—revolve the Dipper and traverse the Winnowing Basket, covertly aligning with celestial degrees. Naturally, the numinous embryo forms in secret, and the divine crucible gains radiance.\n\nZiye says: The Great Yin and Great Yang unite once a month. The method of refinement exchanges hours for days, and when *li* and *kan* merge, it is the moment of darkness ending and the new moon’s medicine arising—no ordinary time. Master Shangyang says: In a year, the moon waxes twelve times, clearly marking the days of yang’s birth. In a month, day and night span three thousand *ke*—in every *ke*, seek the hour of *gui*’s generation. In wild battle, one gathers lead; when guarding the city, only warm and nurture. To know fortune and misfortune is to ensure success.\n\nWhen *pi* and *tai* just meet, the myriad things flourish; when *zhun* and *meng* receive their hexagrams, they are endowed with generation and completion. In this, grasp the meaning and cease seeking images—if you exhaust the lines, you will vainly labor the mind.\n\nDaoguang says: The winter and summer solstices are the origins of one yin and one yang. The *zi* and *wu* hours are the beginnings of one day and one night. The sages moved the tally and fire of yin and yang, harmonizing with the Dao of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, the principle of sun and moon’s coming and going. Gathering the four seasons, eight nodes, twenty-four qi, and seventy-two *hou*, they arrayed them within the crucible to generate the body of True Unity. Thus, they entrusted it to hexagram images, dividing the work across the three decades of a month to unfold the mystery and clarify the fire phases. To cling to and employ the lines and images is mistaken.\n\nYet *zhun* and *meng* are the first of all hexagrams, symbolizing the beginning of action and generation, the origin of endowment and transformation. Thus, at dawn, *zhun*; at dusk, *meng*. When *pi* and *tai* operate, yang ascends and yin descends. At the spring equinox, yang qi ascends to the center of heaven and earth, yin and yang equally balanced, forming the *tai* hexagram—like the moon’s first quarter and its qi phase. At this time, yin and yang naturally merge; not advancing the fire phase is called bathing. At the autumn equinox, yin qi descends to the center of heaven and earth, yin and yang equally balanced, forming the *pi* hexagram—like the moon’s last quarter and its qi phase. At this time, yin and yang naturally conjoin; not advancing the fire phase is called bathing. Such is the method and image—why labor over hexagram lines?\n\nZiye says: When yin and yang unite, the myriad things are born. Born without end, what enables their union is the fire phase. Dawn *zhun* and dusk *meng* are the guiding principles of applying fire. If scholars understand this, the remaining hexagram images will follow naturally.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: Before heaven and earth communicate, it is *pi*; when yin and yang have merged, it is *tai*. *Zhun* receives the beginning of generation and completion; *meng* receives the work of nurturing and rearing. This speaks of the inner elixir’s Dao.\n\nHexagrams set forth images to model forms; grasp the image, forget the words, and the meaning becomes clear. Later generations, deluded, cling only to images, practicing hexagram qi in hopes of ascending—how lamentable.\n\nDaoguang says: Hexagrams are the snares and traps of fire. Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi*, expounding the *Yijing*’s images to illuminate the elixir’s Dao, likening *qian* and *kun* to the crucible and vessel, *kan* and *li* to the medicinal substances. Thus, the four hexagrams reside in the central palace, not bound to the revolving hub’s numbers. The sixty hexagrams are distributed across a month, moving the tally and fire, beginning with *zhun* and *meng*, ending with *jiji* and *weiji*, cycling endlessly like a wheel, turning without cease. Each day governs two hexagrams, thirty days for sixty hexagrams. Together with the four hexagrams *qian*, *kun*, *kan*, and *li*, they total sixty-four, with three hundred eighty-four lines, modeling a year and its intercalary month. The remaining three hundred eighty-four days mirror the weight of two times eight *jin* of golden elixir—one *jin* calculated as three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. All these are metaphors and images. If the fire phases are understood, hexagrams and lines become superfluous. Scholars who instead cling to these and practice hexagram qi, exhausting their bodies and minds in hopes of ascending—is this not pitiful?\n\nZiye says: The former masters borrowed the *Yijing*’s yin and yang as metaphors, merely to enact one’s own transformation. Those who cling to images and rigidly follow texts, seeking steeds by tracing pictures, are far from the Dao.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: The elixir’s Dao likens *qian* and *kun* to the crucible and vessel to make known the male and female. It likens dragon and tiger to *kan* and *li* as medicinal substances, thereby revealing that lead and mercury are the products of tiger and dragon. People fixate on the *Yijing*’s words but do not understand the hexagrams’ use. If they understood the hexagrams’ use, they would not grasp the *Yijing*’s Dao.\n\nTo understand the Dao of the *Yijing* lies within the body, not in hexagram qi.\n\nHeaven and Earth wax and wane in their own time—only by discerning their ebb and flow can one grasp the mechanism. Since ancient times, the *geng* and *jia* have proclaimed the decree; when the Three Worms are slain, the Dao may be attained.\n\nDaoguang says: Heaven and Earth are separated by eighty-four thousand *li*. At the winter solstice, yang qi rises from within the Earth, ascending four hundred sixty *li* and two hundred forty *bu* in a single day. Five days make one *hou*, three *hou* make one *qi*, three *qi* make one *jie*, and three *jie* make one season—this is the spring equinox. Over ninety days, yang qi ascends a total of forty-two thousand *li*, reaching the exact midpoint between Heaven and Earth. At this time, yang within yin is half-complete, corresponding to the *Tai* hexagram. Its qi transforms from cold to warm, the moment when the myriad things arise.\n\nFrom this point onward, yang qi ascends into the yang position, reaching the summer solstice after a total of one hundred eighty-four days, having ascended eighty-four thousand *li* in all. Now, yang within yang is complete, corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram, called \"pure yang.\" Its qi transforms from warm to hot, the time when the myriad things flourish and reach fullness—hence, \"fullness.\" When yang reaches its extreme, yin arises. After the summer solstice, yin qi descends from Heaven, falling four hundred sixty *li* and two hundred forty *bu* each day. By the autumn equinox, after ninety days, yin qi has descended forty-two thousand *li*, reaching the midpoint between Heaven and Earth. Now, yin within yang is half-complete, corresponding to the *Pi* hexagram. Its qi transforms from hot to cold, the time when the myriad things bear fruit.\n\nFrom this point onward, yin qi descends into the yin position, reaching the winter solstice after a total of one hundred eighty days, having descended eighty-four thousand *li* in all. Now, yin within yin is complete, corresponding to the *Kun* hexagram, called \"pure yin.\" Its qi transforms from cool to cold, the time when the myriad things withdraw and are stored away. Thus, the waxing and waning of Heaven and Earth are revealed through the moon.\n\nThe moon begins with the sun. On the third day, the *Zhen* trigram’s *geng* takes form; on the eighth day, the *Dui* trigram’s *ding* forms the crescent. On the fifteenth day, the *Qian* trigram’s *jia* reaches fullness—hence, \"fullness.\" On the sixteenth day, the *Xun* trigram’s *xin* assumes governance; on the twenty-third day, the *Gen* trigram’s *bing* forms the waning crescent. On the thirtieth day, the *Kun* trigram’s *yi* vanishes—hence, \"waning.\"\n\nThe sages discerned the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s waxing and waning, transposing a year’s qi and seasons into a single month. Thus, one day’s birth of yang is the winter solstice. Two and a half days correspond to one month’s qi, so that at the first quarter, yin within yang is half-complete—this is the spring equinox. By the fifteenth day, the qi of the fourth month is attained; the moon’s fullness is pure yang, and yang qi reaches its full wheel—hence, \"fullness.\" On the sixteenth day, one yin is born—this is the summer solstice. At the last quarter, yang within yin is half-complete—this is the autumn equinox. On the thirtieth day, the qi of the tenth month is attained; the moon’s darkness is the end of yin, and yin qi completes its wheel—hence, \"waning.\" Ending and beginning anew, it cycles without cease.\n\nThe sages moved the tally of yin and the fire of yang, following Heaven and Earth’s waxing and waning, ascent and descent, and cyclical return. The sixty-four hexagrams model the principle of *geng* and *jia*’s waxing and waning, just as a ruler proclaims decrees to slay the yin worms—only then may the Dao be attained.\n\nZiye says: When scholars perceive the principle of Heaven and Earth’s waxing and waning, they practice it within themselves, seizing the decree of *sheng geng* and *man jia*. After the new moon and before the full moon, they gather the qi of Heaven and Earth at its fullness, returning it to the body to refine and form the elixir. Then, how could the corpse-demons fail to be destroyed?\n\nShangyang says: The tide comes in full, the tide goes out empty—this is the waxing and waning of Heaven and Earth. The moon waxes full, the moon wanes empty—this is the waxing and waning of the sun and moon. Spring gives birth, summer grows, autumn gathers, winter stores—this is the waxing and waning of the four seasons. Qi flourishes and is full, qi scatters and is empty—this is the waxing and waning of the human body. *Gui* is born and is full, the full moon recedes and is empty—this is the waxing and waning of the golden elixir.\n\nMaster Changchun says: Like the qi of a bellows, when qi is full, it is strong; when qi is weak, it is empty. This waxing and waning of qi is most essential. If one can discern and employ it, at the outset of practice, one must first expel the Three Worms and Six Bandits, refining the heart until it is like the Great Void, purifying the six roots completely—only then may one enter the chamber to refine the Great Elixir.\n\nTo attain the Valley Spirit’s eternal life,\nOne must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation.\nWhen true essence returns to the Golden Chamber,\nA single pearl of numinous light will never depart.\n\nDaoguang says: That which is unfathomable in yin and yang is called \"spirit.\" Responsive and immediately penetrating, like an echo answering a sound—hence, \"Valley Spirit.\" Spirit is established through qi, and qi is born from essence. When essence is refined, it generates qi; qi generates spirit. Thus, spirit and qi are the masters of the body, and the body is the vessel of form and qi. Without spirit, form cannot endure; without qi, life cannot arise. Spirit and qi cannot stand without form—these two things depend on each other to give birth. If one seeks the foundation of long life, it rests entirely on the Mysterious Female. Once the Mysterious Female is established, then long life may be achieved.\n\nThe myriad things are born through this and die through this. It is truly the root of Heaven and Earth, the ancestor of the Five Phases, the origin of yin and yang, and the foundation of the ten thousand transformations. The sages relied on this to complete the outer elixir and borrowed it to accomplish the inner medicine. Thus, true essence returns to the Golden Chamber, transforming into a single pearl of numinous light, transmuting the body into qi, and qi into spirit. When form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth, hidden and manifest, unfathomable.\n\nZiye says: \"Valley\" means \"to nourish.\" The Mysterious Female is yin and yang. If one wishes to nourish the spirit and attain long life, one must achieve the harmony of yin and yang. Only then will the golden essence return to one’s Central Palace, like a single luminous pearl enduring forever.\n\nShangyang says: \"The Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.\"\n\nThe Gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth. These are the words of Laozi, which the immortal masters later clarified for posterity to establish the foundation. The Mysterious Female is the gateway of ingress and egress within the human body, from which the Golden Elixir is refined and conjoined. Those who undertake great cultivation must first thoroughly comprehend the principle of the Mysterious Female—this is the place where yin and yang unite in essence—only then can one obtain the single luminous pearl of numinous light.\n\nThe Gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known to the world; some mistakenly point to the mouth and nose as its location. Even if you exhale and inhale for a thousand years, how could you ever achieve the union of the Golden Crow and the Jade Hare?\n\nDaoguang says: The Gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth. None in the world can comprehend this unless they encounter a true master to instruct them. Since the beginning of creation, without these two things of the Mysterious Female, how could the ten thousand things ever come to be? Both the inner and outer elixirs are established from this. The sages kept it secret, calling it the \"sun-suspended, moon-furnace, hanging embryo cauldron.\" The Golden Crow is the Golden Elixir. With this Golden Elixir, one can restrain one’s own yin mercury, like a cat seizing a rat or a hawk grasping a hare.\n\nSome say the Mysterious Female is the primordial cavity between the two kidneys—this is incorrect. The Mysterious Female consists of two things; without these two, how could the ten thousand things be transformed? How could one point to a single cavity in the ordinary body and generalize it thus? Those who take the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female are truly laughable.\n\nZiye says: The previous chapter only spoke of the two characters \"Mysterious Female,\" while this chapter further elucidates the character \"Gate,\" revealing its profound principle. The Gate is the place of ingress and egress, the site of yin-yang union. Without the true transmission passed down through heart and mouth, how could one presume to guess and know it?\n\nShangyang says: After Laozi pointed out the four characters \"Gate of the Mysterious Female,\" later true masters and immortals were able to proceed with refining the Great Elixir. Foolish people take the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female and regard breathing exercises as the Way. Such gross errors—how could they ever achieve the union of the Crow and Hare?\n\nDifferent names arise from the same source, yet few understand; these two mysteries hold the essential mechanism. Preserving life and perfecting form, clarifying gain and loss, the Purple Gold Elixir is most wondrous and rare.\n\nDaoguang says: The *Classic* states: \"Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Named, it is the mother of the ten thousand things.\" It also says: \"These two emerge together yet bear different names.\" When it is \"non-being,\" the true One qi is invisible, thus it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. When it is \"being,\" the true One pearl appears in the mysterious void, thus it is the mother of the ten thousand things. In Heaven, it is *li* as mercury; on Earth, it is *kan* as lead. Their essence is one, though their functions differ. Together they are called \"mysterious,\" mysterious upon mystery.\n\nThe superior person, the perfected one, grasps the mysterious mechanism of these two to clarify gain and loss, to govern the body. Then form can be preserved and life secured. What is called \"loss\" refers to the five phases proceeding in sequence, where the ordinary Way has arising and ceasing. What is called \"gain\" refers to the five phases reversing, where the elixir body remains eternally numinous and enduring.\n\nAlas! The Pure Yang Purple Gold stands at the beginning of Heaven and Earth, emerging as the mother of the ten thousand things—is this not the most wondrous of the Golden Elixir?\n\nZiye says: The One qi divides into yin and yang, hence the different names. Yet both arise from the Great Ultimate, thus it is said they emerge from the same source. Yin and yang are the essential mechanism of cultivation, preserving my life, perfecting my form, causing no loss to the other while benefiting myself. How marvelous—gold within water!\n\nShangyang says: \"Different names\" refer to being and non-being, subtlety and wonder, beginning and mother, mystery and female. This is the place of yin-yang union, the site where the Golden Elixir is transformed and born. Those of superior capacity must first awaken to these two, then they may refine the Purple Gold Elixir.\n\nBeginning with action, no one sees; only when it becomes non-action do the masses recognize it. They see only non-action as the essential wonder, yet how could they know that action is the root?\n\nDaoguang says: The trap and net are still in hand—no one understands me! Once ashore, the boat is no longer needed, yet ten eyes stare in bewilderment. Saints and commoners mingle in the marketplace, fish and dragons blend on the thoroughfare. How lamentable—people of the world pass by without recognition!\n\nZiye says: In gathering the medicine and circulating the fire, does one attain non-action? Knowing only non-action but not action—how can the elixir be congealed?\n\nShangyang says: If one reaches old age in non-action, how can the medicine be obtained? Entering the chamber to gather lead—this is called \"action.\" The great hermit dwells in the marketplace—who would notice? To establish the vast enclosure, first set up the boundary. Obtaining the single grain of millet pearl—this is not mistaken. Nine years of sitting in forgetfulness—non-action’s merit is vast. When the three thousand deeds are complete, one rejoices with the multitude.\n\nIf one only practices non-action without first engaging in action, this is the delusion of a foolish person clinging to attachment. These few earnest words are offered to instruct later learners.\n\nWithin black there is white—this is the mother of the elixir. Within the male, the female is concealed—this is the sacred embryo. The Great One in the furnace must be guarded with care; the Three Fields gather treasures, corresponding to the Three Terraces.\n\nDaoguang says: Extracting silver from lead—this is the mother of the elixir. Drawing mercury from cinnabar—this is the sacred embryo. The two things interact and transform, congealing in the furnace. With clarity of essence and timing of qi, strictly adhere to the method. Without the slightest deviation, the three natures unite, forming the elixir treasure, corresponding above to the Three Terraces.\n\nZiye says: White within black is the gold within water, the yang qi within *kan*. If one can gather this true yang qi and congeal it into an embryo—this is what is meant by \"within the male, the female is concealed.\" When gathering the medicine, one must keep the Great One as master in mind. If one is not careful in guarding it, human desires will overflow, and one’s treasure will be lost—would the master not find this strange?\n\nShangyang says: White within black is the yang within yin, the outer elixir’s symbol. The male harboring the female is the yang obtaining yin, the inner elixir’s symbol.\n\nWithin the furnace, the Great One must be guarded with utmost care—thus the treasures of the Three Fields gather. Amidst the indistinct and vague, seek the tangible form; within the obscure and profound, find the true essence. From nothingness and being, they naturally merge—how could one conceive of its completion through mere thought?\n\nDaoguang says: True Yizi states: \"Nothingness is the dragon; being is the tiger. Nothingness is mercury; being is lead.\" Nothingness, stirred by being, takes form; being, moved by nothingness, gains spirit. Thus the millet grain in empty mystery shines with radiance like the dawn.\n\nZiye says: Those who refine the golden elixir must, within the obscure and indistinct, obtain its true essence and true form—only then is the task complete. Without transmission from a master, one cannot rely on clever conjecture.\n\nShangyang says: The Scripture states: \"Vague, yet within it there is something. Indistinct, yet within it there is form. Obscure, yet within it there is essence. Its essence is most true, and within it there is certainty.\" The Way of the golden elixir is fully contained in these words. The immortal master’s reiteration is most intimate and direct—without true oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction, how could one attain it through secretive sitting and visualization?\n\nWhen the Four Symbols unite, the mysterious body is formed;\nWhen the Five Phases are complete, purple gold shines bright.\nOnce the embryo is shed and enters the mouth, the whole body becomes sacred—\nCountless dragons and spirits are utterly astonished.\n\nDaoguang says: When the Four Symbols and Five Phases unite, the essence of the True One coalesces into a millet grain, radiant with purple light. Circulating it internally, when the embryo is shed and enters the mouth, one communes with heaven and earth—dragons and spirits are all struck with awe.\n\nZiye says: After ten months, the sacred embryo is fully formed, the entire body attains sacredness, and one connects with the divine—how could this not inspire awe?\n\nShangyang says: Once attained, it is eternally possessed; naturally, the body becomes light. At this point, when merit is complete and the elixir is efficacious, one is truly a great person.\n\nThe feast at the Flowery Pool concludes, the moon’s radiance clear;\nRiding a golden dragon, one visits the Purple Tenuity.\nFrom then on, after meeting the host of immortals,\nMountains and seas, hills and valleys shift at will.\n\nDaoguang says: When the feast at the Flowery Pool ends, the elixir is successfully refined, the embryo is shed, and the spirit transforms. The skin becomes as pure as ice and snow, graceful as one who rides the qi and mounts the clouds, roaming the eight directions, witnessing the world’s seas turn to mulberry fields.\n\nZiye says: The Flowery Pool is the place where the medicine is produced. When the feast concludes, the medicine is fully gathered, the sacred embryo is complete, and a body exists beyond the body. One pays homage at the origin and visits the imperial court, the immortal isles of Penglai—there is nowhere one cannot go.\n\nShangyang says: The Flowery Pool is the Winding River, the gate of the *kan* palace. The golden elixir is formed from this, and when merit is perfected here, one attains the rank of celestial immortal. This chapter is also the immortal master of Purple Yang’s self-eulogy, bequeathed to later generations. For the immortal master is one of the stars of the Purple Tenuity Heavenly Palace.\n\nTo know the method of the golden liquid returning elixir,\nOne must plant the seed in the home garden.\nNo need for blowing or straining—\nNaturally, the fruit ripens and the true embryo is shed.\n\nDaoguang says: This Way is very near, existing in one’s own home garden—one should hasten to cultivate it. If it is not of the same kind, it becomes ever more distant; if one obtains the same kind, what effort is required?\n\nZiye says: The medicine is gathered from another’s home but returned to one’s own garden to be cultivated until ripe—this is the wonder of nature, not the work of human effort.\n\nShangyang says: The method of the returning elixir exists in one’s own home garden. The golden flower’s seed can be cultivated on its own—no need for furnace or bellows. When the fruit ripens, the embryo is shed. Those beyond the world—monks in their round hats and patched robes—should know that the wonder of the home garden lies within the marketplace. Vimalakīrti, Fu Dashi, and others all obtained this garden to plant their seeds, which is why the Tathāgata named it the Garden of Solitary Joy.\n\nDo not apply clever deceit as effort;\nRecognize the deathless method from another’s home.\nIn the pot, constantly replenish the wine of life;\nIn the tripod, gather the returning soul’s nectar.\n\nDaoguang says: Those who cultivate the truth often cling to false and clever methods, applying effort to themselves—how could they achieve success? If one awakens to the deathless medicine in another’s home and adds the fire of returning life within the abdomen, this is the true treasure.\n\nZiye says: This Way is the reversal of true yang, stealing the life within the mechanism of killing. It is not the three-peak sexual arts or other clever deceits and drifting techniques. Wine and nectar are both divine water.\n\nShangyang says: Previously, it spoke of planting in the home garden; now it speaks of the deathless method from another’s home—are these not two different things? The wine of extended life and the nectar of returning soul are both true essence and true qi. The Scripture states: \"Immortals and Daoists can accumulate spirit and amass qi, making them truly real.\"\n\nA fine brew from the snowy mountain,\nPoured into the Dongyang crucible of creation.\nIf it passes northwest beyond Kunlun,\nOnly Zhang Qian will see Lady Ma.\n\nDaoguang says: The snowy mountain symbolizes whiteness; the western mountain is the image of metal. It compares the golden elixir—a single grain, its taste like ghee—ingested into the crucible of creation in the cinnabar field. Kunlun lies within the sea; the Kunlun of our body originally resides in the lower sea of water, where the form resembling Kunlun arises—the place where fire is generated. At the summit of Kunlun is a gate called the Mysterious Gate, also known as the Heavenly Gate in the northwest *qian* position. Zhang Qian symbolizes the *qian* hexagram, its line image true mercury, representing yin fire. Lady Ma symbolizes the *kun* hexagram, its line image true lead, representing yang fire. When fire is emitted from the Mysterious Gate of Kunlun and enters, only then does the true lead within the tripod appear and undergo transformation. As the true embryo melts within and true fire connects without, the *kun* trigram transforms into the *qian* trigram, yin water returns to yang tally. South fire communicates, lead and mercury unite—the root of the immortal’s Way lies herein.\n\nZhang Qian rides the raft to the Moon Palace,\nEncountering the Woman constellation—\nThis illustrates the meaning of yin and yang meeting.\n\nZiye said: The *tihu* is the golden liquid within *kan*, drawn into *li*—*li* is myself. Then, circulate it from the *weilü* through the *niwan*, descending from the abdomen to the *dantian*, where it merges with the yin mercury within the body to become one.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Snow Mountain is the land of utmost yin, yet within yin resides yang—hence the saying, \"the finest *tihu* pours upon the crown.\" That which is poured in then reverses to reside above. I belong to the east, thus called Eastern Yang. My Mysterious Gate is named the Furnace of Creation. The Kunlun and Zhang Qian’s Dao-light have already been explained. The Buddha’s past practice on Snow Mountain refers precisely to this. The ancients named it after its place, often borrowing names to represent things.\n\nThose who fail to recognize yang essence and the host-guest relationship—how can they discern intimacy from estrangement? Closing the *weilü* cavity in vain during bedroom arts has misled countless souls in Jambudvīpa.\n\nDaoguang said: Master Zhongli once stated: \"The four great elements of the body all belong to yin—what, then, is yang essence?\" The true one’s essence is the qi of utmost yang, called Yang Elixir, which comes from without to govern one’s yin mercury—thus serving as the host. When the two long for each other, they congeal into golden sand, naturally unyielding, and so the Returned Elixir is formed. Deluded disciples, failing to grasp this principle, instead practice bedroom arts of controlling women, forcibly closing the *weilü*, calling it \"refining yin\" to prolong life—this is truly carrying firewood to extinguish a fire. As the *Yinfu Jing* says: \"Fire is born from wood, and calamity inevitably follows.\" How can one not be cautious?\n\nZiye said: Yang essence is indeed the metal within *kan*. Though it comes from without, it is originally a substance within the body—only a hair’s breadth separates their shared origin from differing names.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Though yang essence is obtained through the bedroom, it is not the art of controlling women. Practicing such arts is a deviant path—how can it lead to longevity? Thus the Buddha said: \"Those who walk the deviant path cannot see the Tathāgata.\" Without a true master to point out the path of yang essence, all side doors become deviant paths. The blind masters of the world pass down the monstrous techniques of \"three-peak yin absorption\" and \"controlling women,\"所谓 \"the blind leading the blind.\" When the night of the thirtieth of the twelfth month arrives, they instead blame the alchemical classics for deception, never reflecting on their own errors. Thus the immortal elder reveals this poem:\n\nAll things in profusion return to their roots,\nReturning to the root and reviving the mandate ensures eternal abiding.\nThose who know constancy and return to the origin are rarely understood,\nWhile reckless actions summon misfortune—all have heard of this.\n\nThe Dao Guang says: The scripture states, \"The myriad things flourish abundantly, each returning to its root.\" Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called reviving the mandate. Reviving the mandate is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Before a person is born, they dwell in profound unknowing, merged with primordial simplicity. When they are born, they receive the endowment of yin and yang from their parents. The sage reverses this process and cultivates it, seizing the qi of prior heaven to form the \"elixir mother.\" They plunder the initial qi of yin and yang to establish the foundation of transformation. Refining the form, they return to formlessness; refining the qi, they revert to primordial simplicity. Those who know the constant Dao and return to this knowing are sages. Thus, those who attain longevity yet do not know the constant Dao and act recklessly are the deluded masses, and so they summon misfortune.\n\nZi Ye says: Even things like grasses and trees can return to their roots and revert to their origin, enduring through the years. Humans, the most spiritually endowed of all beings, move toward death yet cannot match the grasses and trees. This Dao is the way of returning to the root and reverting to the origin—it is not the reckless path that invites misfortune.\n\nShang Yang Zi says: All things have their time of returning to the root. The perfected person understands the principle of longevity. When grasses and trees encounter the extreme of yin, they return to their roots and await spring to flourish again. When a person’s qi and blood are about to decline, they must seek the way of returning to the root, which can restore youth, revert to infancy, and ensure longevity. Alas! Returning to the root is the returning elixir. \"Constant\" refers to the worldly laws of ordinary existence. Only by thoroughly mastering these worldly laws in profound secrecy can one revert to the origin and return to the primordial—this is knowing constancy. Thus, those who \"greatly conceal themselves in the marketplace\" do so to remain unrecognized. If even the slightest matter is not kept secret and one acts recklessly, they will invite misfortune and slander. Therefore, Bodhidharma came from afar to the eastern land seeking to accomplish Buddhahood, desiring to avoid misfortune and escape slander. The Sixth Chan Master concealed himself among hunters in Sihui for the same reason—to avoid misfortune and attain Buddhahood. Later, when Dao Guang Chan Master received the transmission from Stone Immortal, he had no choice but to return to lay life, relying on the powerful to complete this endeavor. Our Chongyang Emperor Lord dwelled in the \"Tomb of the Living Dead\" to attain the Dao. The Supreme Void Immortal went to the Wuyi Mountains for seven months. The Longevity Immortal Lord went to Luoyang for three years. The ancients toiled and struggled solely for this matter. Yet today’s learners casually remember a word or two from the former worthies and mistake it for the Dao, endlessly discussing it. Then there are the foolish ones who, without studying the conduct of immortals and sages, slander the practice of cultivation, saying, \"In this world, there is birth and there is death—how could there be a way to endure forever?\" These are seeds of hell, willingly bound to the wheel of rebirth. Next are the attached ones who, when someone vaguely points out a side door or minor path, claim they can walk it. Having never encountered a true immortal or perfected person, they neither know how to return to the root and revive the mandate nor understand the dharma beyond the world, nor do they recognize what \"of the same kind\" means. If they did know, and could conceal themselves within the ordinary world to complete this great task of conditioned existence, yet still acted recklessly without caution, would they not invite calamity? Thus, the scripture says: \"Knowing constancy is called clarity; not knowing constancy and acting recklessly invites misfortune.\" Knowing constancy is to be accommodating; being accommodating is to be impartial.\n\nOu Leng secretly transmitted the method for forging the sword,\nMoye’s metal and water tempered softness and hardness.\nOnce refined, it understands the wielder’s intent,\nChasing evil a thousand miles in a flash of lightning.\n\nDao Guang says: When Ou Ye forged the sword, the Heavenly Emperor sent a divine maiden to tend the furnace. It was crafted with metal and water, tempered with softness and hardness. Once completed, it could slay demons like a flash of lightning, so wondrous was its power. The sage’s work in forging the sword is the same: using heaven and earth as the furnace, yin and yang as water and fire, harmonizing the five phases, refining with spirit and qi. Once the precious sword is forged, it can bend or straighten, soften or harden, do good or evil, be round or square. When the mind conceives a thought or the will directs an intention, it flies forth to slay in a flash of lightning. This is the divine sword. Without this sword in elixir refinement, it is like trying to catch fish or rabbits without a net or snare.\n\nZi Ye says: In refining the elixir and gathering the medicine, one relies entirely on the wisdom sword to subdue demons and slay monsters. In an instant, it transforms; in the blink of an eye, it traverses ten thousand miles. If the wisdom sword lacks sharpness, how could it not be harmed by demons and monsters?\n\nShang Yang Zi says: To forge this sword, one cannot use ordinary metal or iron. This divine sword slays the Three Corpses within and eliminates evil without. The foolish use this sword to destroy themselves; the sage uses it to make their spirit soar. Master Jingyang had five immortal maidens play with the sword to slay the demonic flood dragon. Dongbin used the Three Clarities’ sacred sword to erase the traces of spirits. In Buddhism, it is also called the Vajra Treasure Sword—truly the instrument of immortals and Buddhas.\n\nKnocking bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade mushroom,\nPlaying the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife-point elixir.\nLately, the golden light shines through the body,\nNot speaking of these principles to ordinary people.\n\nDao Guang says: Bamboo is a hollow-hearted thing, embodying the meaning of non-attachment. The zither produces the proper sound of music, embodying the meaning of harmony. The turtle is the Black Tiger; the phoenix is the Red Dragon. The qi of the dragon’s string is called the jade mushroom; the qi of the tiger’s string is called the knife-point elixir. The dragon and tiger are non-sentient beings, yet they can mate, hence the term \"knocking,\" like two things striking each other. When the dragon and tiger unite as husband and wife, they achieve harmony, hence the term \"playing the zither.\" When the dragon and tiger mate, the qi of their two strings swallow and devour each other. Once the returning elixir is refined, the golden light shines through the body, radiant with mystery and brilliance, wind rising beneath both armpits to depart the mortal realm.\n\nZi Ye says: The jade mushroom and knife-point elixir are alternate names for the medicine. The medicine is born in Kan, which contains the yang of Qian. Qian is metal and jade, hence the metaphors of jade mushroom and knife-point elixir. Knocking bamboo and playing the zither are the harmonious sounds of yin and yang seeking each other.\n\nThe bamboo, hollow at heart, responds with primal desire; the zither, tuned to true harmony, remains undisturbed. This resonance is no ordinary perverse or deceptive sound—no lewd music of Zheng or Wei. Blowing the tortoise to summon the phoenix: that which is rooted in Heaven inclines upward, while that which is rooted in Earth inclines downward. As *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states, this is the meaning of the \"upper magpie bridge\" and the \"lower magpie bridge.\" Moreover, Li is the bird, the Vermilion Phoenix of the southern direction, a metaphor for Kan. To summon Li is to receive its medicine, for Li is none other than myself.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: Bamboo is a thing hollow within and straight without; if it is not straight, one knocks it to ensure it responds to things. The zither embodies the harmony of its strings and markers; if it is not harmonious, one tunes it to accomplish the task at hand. The jade mushroom is the Qian dragon, while the knife-point elixir is a Kun substance. To call the tortoise pertains to me; to summon the phoenix requires the other. Without great harmony, how could one summon the phoenix? For those who cultivate the Way, once the hexagram qi has passed, if the bamboo fails to respond, must it not be struck? Striking is knocking. If the zither is not in harmony, must it not be tuned? Tuning is playing.\n\nThus, whether at seventy, eighty, or even one hundred and twenty years of age, one may still refine the returning elixir—such is this Dao. How could mediocre scholars or common men comprehend this? How could false teachers or deluded practitioners ever know it? Without the oral transmission of a true immortal or sagely master under heaven’s covenant, who could attain this knowledge?\n\nLong ago, my master Ziqiong often attended the Supreme Void Perfected One. Once, a disputatious scholar sought an audience, daily striking bamboo, blowing the tortoise, and swallowing jade mushrooms. He asked my master, \"What is calling the tortoise?\" The Supreme Void replied, \"I shall tell you of calling the tortoise, but first, let me ask you: what is the adversary bamboo?\"\n\nThe scholar answered, \"The highest of the highest interlocking mechanisms.\"\n\nThe Supreme Void said, \"I do not ask of the highest interlocking mechanisms. Tell me, what is striking the bamboo?\"\n\nThe scholar replied, \"The most profound and subtle of mechanisms.\"\n\nThe Supreme Void said, \"These words of yours were learned from those who sit endlessly on long benches. Take them and debate with the world—this is not the place for you to call the tortoise.\" The man failed to awaken. After Ziqiong dragged him out, the Supreme Void asked Ziqiong, \"Do you know striking the bamboo?\"\n\nZiqiong answered, \"Abiding in stillness, yet responding when moved.\"\n\nThe Supreme Void asked, \"Do you know calling the tortoise?\"\n\nZiqiong replied, \"Offering deference to others brings its own reward.\"\n\nThe Supreme Void said, \"Why did the disputatious scholar not speak thus?\"\n\nZiqiong answered, \"He has not received a master’s transmission and thus cannot force a guess.\"\n\nThe Supreme Void admonished further: \"To know is not difficult; to practice is the true difficulty. The medicine meets its kindred qi and only then forms its image; the Dao resides in the subtle and imperceptible, harmonizing with nature. When a single grain of the numinous elixir is swallowed, one begins to know that my life is not ruled by heaven.\"\n\nDaoguang said: \"There is a thing formlessly formed, born before heaven and earth. The sages forcibly named it the Primordial Unity of the True One’s qi—though invisible to the eye, it responds when moved. Descending, it becomes the numinous elixir, like a single precious pearl within the empty mystery. Take and ingest it, and immediately mercury is stabilized and lead transmuted, transforming into a body of pure yang: one’s years then equal heaven’s. Chaoyuanzi said: 'Death and life are entirely the Dao of heaven and earth; one’s nature and life originally belong to mercury and lead.' Is this not proof that my life lies in what I do?\"\n\nZiye said: \"The Dao is simply the Dao—purity and stillness are essential. The medicine is simply the medicine—only when it meets its kindred does it form. If one seeks what is not its kindred, one’s efforts are in vain.\"\n\nShangyangzi said: \"The *Book of Changes* states, 'In the southwest, one gains companions and walks with one’s kind.' If two yang forces are of the same kind, they become scorching drought—how could there be mutual resonance of nature and feeling? If two yin forces share the same chamber, there must be strife—how could yin and yang be of the same kind? Only when yin follows yang does it become kindred; only when lead enters water does it become medicine. The medicine transforms into the elixir, the elixir into spirit; when form and spirit are both wondrous, life lies within me. The radiant golden elixir is completed in a single day—ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding. Those who speak of nine years or three years merely procrastinate and delay.\"\n\nDaoguang said: \"The great medicine of the golden elixir—even an inferior practitioner need not exceed half an hour to obtain and ingest it. When I speak of 'a single day,' I refer to seizing that half-hour within it. Once the golden elixir enters the mouth, one immediately ascends to the sacred realm. With such wondrous efficacy, how could one delay for nine years or three?\"\n\nZiye said: \"The method of making the elixir fundamentally requires the union of lead and mercury, and in an instant, the elixir’s essence forms. Yet one must thoroughly understand the moment when lead is born—at that time, the myriad things sprout, possessing qi but no form; the water’s source is utterly pure. How wondrous! And what time is this? Ah! It is the moment when this year ends and the next has not yet begun.\"\n\nShangyangzi said: \"The method of refining the elixir requires knowing the other’s living *zi* hour. If this is not the utmost subtlety in the world, who could attain it? The great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—know that it depends on both oneself and heaven. Without accumulating virtuous deeds and cultivating hidden virtue, one will surely encounter demonic obstacles.\"\n\nDaoguang said: \"Demonic obstacles lie in the external; cultivation lies within me. With abundant hidden virtue, the numinous elixir may be hoped for.\"\n\nZiye said: \"The great Dao of the golden elixir—ancient masters transmitted it once in ten thousand kalpas, for it is no trifling matter. The Dao is lofty, and thus demons must flourish. Without the support of hidden virtue, one may suffer the calamity of a broken will.\"\n\nShangyangzi said: \"Earlier, I spoke of 'my life not being ruled by heaven,' meaning the wondrous workings of creation lie within me. Here, I say 'it depends on both oneself and heaven,' for refining the returning elixir first requires accumulating hidden virtue. To give without seeking repayment is hidden virtue. To accumulate good deeds without others knowing is hidden virtue. To not lead others into peril is hidden virtue. To secretly perform acts of kindness is hidden virtue. Great cultivators who have not yet amassed sufficient virtue are rarely unassailed by external demons. If one can reflect inwardly, cultivate great forbearance, and advance with diligence, then demonic obstacles transform into hidden virtue. The scriptures say: 'When misfortune comes, I return with blessing. When resentment comes, I repay with virtue.' All this is the power of abundant hidden virtue and the merit of subduing demons.\"\n\nThe three powers mutually steal, and at their appointed time, the Dao, virtue, and immortals conceal this mechanism. When the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease, the hundred bones are all ordered, and non-action is realized.\n\nDaoguang said: \"Heaven and earth steal from the myriad things through the four seasons, thus there is flourishing and withering, and they cannot remain forever flourishing. The myriad things steal from humans through the five flavors, thus there is life and death, and they cannot remain forever living. Humans steal from the myriad things through the five phases, thus there is preservation and destruction, and they cannot remain forever preserved. When the three stealings are fitting and the three powers are at peace, there is life and death, flourishing and withering, preservation and destruction, things and self—all arising in profusion, endlessly cycling. This is the natural Dao. If one can merge these three stealings into one, reverse their mechanism and act, go against their time and ingest, then the hundred bones are all ordered, the myriad transformations are naturally at peace, all concerns cease, and the Dao of non-action is realized.\"\n\nZiye said: \"To steal is to take what others do not perceive. The method of cultivation steals the mechanism of heaven and earth, pilfering the life within death. When one grasps this principle, the hundred bones are at peace.\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"The term 'stealing' is not what the vulgar world calls theft. It is the method of the Golden Elixir, stealing that primordial, pre-heaven and pre-earth spark of true yang’s inception-qi to refine the Returned Elixir. Only those of lofty Dao and weighty virtue—those who are among the immortals—can conceal and employ this mechanism. It is not something those of slanderous virtue and corrupt conduct, or mediocre people, can know. Even if they chance to know it, they either doubt or are deluded. Why? Because they lack virtue. Thus, the immortals of Dao and virtue conceal this mechanism.\n\n*The Three Strategies* contains over three hundred treasured characters; *The Scripture of Dao and Virtue* holds five thousand numinous words. Countless immortals of past and present have all, through this, attained the true explanation.\n\nDaoguang said: \"These two scriptures are the pivot of all scriptures, the linchpin controlling the mechanisms of all masters.\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"*The Three Strategies* and *The Scripture of Dao and Virtue* are the ancestral texts of the Elixir. All immortals have revered them as stepping-stones, cultivating them to achieve the Dao. Yet their meaning is profound and distant; the world is shallow, people frivolous, and few can grasp this. Thus, the immortal master composed *Awakening to Reality*, so that later learners, upon seeing it, would be immediately enlightened, easily comprehending and practicing it. Know then that *The Three Strategies*, *The Scripture of Dao and Virtue*, and *Awakening to Reality*—these three books speak of one and the same matter.\n\nThough your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,\nWithout a radiant teacher, do not force your guesses.\nFor the Golden Elixir has no oral transmission—\nWhere then can you conceive the numinous embryo?\n\nDaoguang said: \"A thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises merely spread branches and leaves. The supreme Dao is not complex—it is uniquely transmitted as the mind-seal. Without encountering a true teacher, forced guesses will not suffice.\"\n\nZiye said: \"Without the true essentials from a teacher’s oral transmission, where can one begin?\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"The nine schools and hundred arts can all be left on paper, or known through clever guesses and wisdom. Only the matter of the Golden Elixir cannot be grasped by force of will without a true teacher’s step-by-step guidance. Some may receive a teacher’s brief words on the crucible but not know the time when the medicine arises—this will not produce the Elixir. Knowing the medicine but not the firing times will not produce the Elixir. Knowing the firing times but not the inversion will not produce the Elixir. Knowing the inversion but not the subtle refinement of the self will not produce the Elixir. Knowing the refinement of the self but not the dual use of method and resources will not produce the Elixir. Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingesting the Medicine* states: 'A deviation by a hair’s breadth will fail to produce the Elixir.'\n\nAlas! The foolish of the world rely on their wit, seeking to understand through words. They trust their cleverness, attempting to grasp it through the mind. Some, through perverse means, practice 'exploratory battles'; others merely sit in dry emptiness. The immortal master’s compassion is boundless; his verses are urgent, and many later seekers have benefited.\n\nOnce the mind-monkey is thoroughly tamed and the mechanism of the square inch is stilled,\nThree thousand merits and deeds align with heaven.\nNaturally, the crucible simmers dragon and tiger—\nWhy cling to home, long for wife and child?\n\nDaoguang said: \"These words are most earnest—why do people not turn back?\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"Heaven and earth’s work: spring births, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter seals. The flourishing and withering of the myriad things, the revolutions of the stars—creation’s turning completes its cycle in just three hundred sixty days. For the cultivator, restraining the mind-monkey, cleansing the square inch, retrieving the jewel from the river of desire—this takes but half a double-hour. Guarding the Returned Elixir within the chamber of spirit for some three thousand days, merits fill creation, virtue subdues ghosts and spirits—is this not merit and deeds aligning with heaven?\n\nBefore refining the Returned Elixir, hasten to begin—\nTime waits for no one.\nOnce refined, know when to stop.\nIf you cling to fullness with an insatiable heart,\nYou may one day suffer disgrace.\n\nDaoguang said: \"If the Elixir is not yet refined, hasten to begin—time does not wait. Once the Elixir is refined, embrace oneness and guard completion, facing the wall for nine years—thus the Dao is magnified.\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"Before refining the Returned Elixir, hasten to refine it. Once the Elixir is refined, hasten to leave it. The Buddha said: 'After achieving the Dao, abandon the alchemical chamber and its vessels.' If you do not leave them, the mind’s realm will appear before you, and the two fears may bring disgrace. The Perfected One of Purple Clarity and White Truth, at midnight, suddenly encountered wind and thunder—this is the proof. Thus, Bodhidharma left the long robe and sat coldly in Shaolin, free from any day’s calamity.\n\nYou must turn the door of death into the door of life—\nDo not cling to the gate of life as the gate of death.\nIf you grasp the mechanism of killing and understand reversal,\nYou will know that harm conceals grace.\n\nDaoguang said: \"The five phases, in sequence, bring life; in reversal, bring death—this is the common Dao. Life that does not generate is long life; compliance that is not compliance is supreme compliance—this is the Elixir Dao. If you can understand this, then harm conceals grace, and a man may conceive.\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"The poem says: 'Illumine the gates and doors, urgently repair them.' If people today grasp this principle, understand the mechanism of life and death, recognize the use of inversion, know the wonder of return, and transform the gate of life and killing—turning suffering into joy, enduring to gather grace—what worry is there of not attaining immortality?\n\nFortune and misfortune arise mutually, interdependent,\nLike echoes and shadows following one another.\nIf you can turn this mechanism of life and killing,\nIn the space of a hand’s turn, calamity becomes blessing.\n\nDaoguang said: \"Yang governs life and is called fortune; yin governs killing and is called misfortune. When yin diminishes, yang grows; when yang reaches its peak, yin arises—mutually interdependent, this is the common Dao. If you cultivate by reversing the mechanism of life and killing, in the space of a hand’s turn, calamity becomes blessing, harm conceals grace, a man may conceive—this is the Elixir Dao.\"\n\nZiye said: \"The five phases in sequence are the fire-pit of the dharma-realm. The five phases in inversion are the seven treasures of the great earth.\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"Creation is in the grasp of my palm; fortune and misfortune are cultivated by me.\"\n\nFlowing with it, one becomes human; reversing it, one births the Elixir.\nThe world’s people, not knowing how to turn the mechanism of life and killing,\nThus spin in the wheel of rebirth without end.\nHow could they know the Dao of becoming Buddha or Immortal lies but in a hand’s turn?\n\nIn cultivation, blend with the vulgar yet harmonize one’s radiance—\nRound when round, square when square.\nManifest or hidden, yielding or resisting—none can fathom,\nHow could men perceive the Unconcealed?\n\nDaoguang said: *The Laozi* states: \"Harmonize its radiance, blend with its dust.\"\nHarmonizing and blending the boundary between heaven and humanity\nIs the true secret essential of cultivation.\n\nZiye said: Outer roundness, inner squareness—this is the realm of deliberate action.\nHow could the Dao’s meaning be made visible to others?\n\nLord Shangyang said: The immortal masters, in their vast compassion,\nNot only reveal the secrets of the Golden Elixir to awaken later generations,\nBut also repeatedly exhort them with worldly teachings—how earnest they are!\nFor the Golden Elixir, the greatest difficulty lies in blending with the vulgar.\nThe deepest subtlety lies in harmonizing one’s radiance.\nThough possessing wondrous efficacy, one does not display sharp edges—\nAdapting to the world with roundness and squareness,\nSubtly shaping transformation without revealing it.\nAt this stage, who can discern one’s actions or concealment?\nAll these are truly the highest matters of great cultivation.\n\nLord Daoguang, upon hearing the words of Apricot Grove, cast off his monastic robes and returned to lay life to fulfill the great matter—was this not blending with the vulgar? The Sixth Patriarch, upon receiving the Fifth Patriarch’s teaching, entered among hunters, unknown to all—was this not blending with the vulgar? Our Great Void Perfected One, having received the wondrous instructions of Master Yellow Chamber, withdrew to seclude himself in Mount Wuyi for seven months before attaining the Dao—was this not harmonizing one’s radiance?\n\nYet today’s yellow-robed and black-clad followers, shaving their crowns and donning patched robes, coiling their topknots and squaring their cassocks—do they truly comprehend the great sigh of our sagely teaching on the burden of possessing a body? How could they know that this very bodily form becomes the greatest obstacle to entering the chamber?\n\nThus, the great hermit in the marketplace dust makes himself unfathomable to others. Those who cultivate the Dharma beyond the world ensure that none can discern their actions or concealment. As Laozi said: *\"When you greet it, you do not see its head; when you follow it, you do not see its rear.\"* And again: *\"Only because it cannot be known is it forced to take on form.\"*\n\nHaving attained this clarity, one looks back at the foolish common folk who seek the Dao through cunning schemes, shallow knowledge, and wanton indulgence—they are farther from it than ever. For those of great cultivation who have reached this stage, should they not repeatedly ponder this poem to achieve the meritorious work of the Dao?\n\n*Five-Character Verse—Symbolizing the Wondrousness of the Great One Containing True Qi*\nA maiden dons azure robes,\nA young lord wears white silk.\nSeen, it cannot be used;\nUsed, it cannot be seen.\nIn vagueness they meet,\nIn darkness transformations arise.\nIn a flash, flames soar—\nThe true person naturally appears.\n\nLord Daoguang said: The maiden is the latent *qi* of the dragon, called Wood Maiden, born of the Azure Dragon—hence she wears azure robes. The young lord is the latent *qi* of the tiger, called Metal Lord, born of the White Tiger—hence he wears white silk. That which has form and can be seen belongs to the dross of later heaven and cannot be used. Only the primordial true unified *qi*, born before heaven and earth, dwelling in vagueness, emerging from darkness, boundless and expansive, spiritually transforming, giving birth to being from non-being—when the fire practice is rectified, the true person appears. This is the wondrousness of the Dao. Without encountering a true master to personally transmit the oral instructions, who could attain this?\n\nZiye said: The maiden in azure robes is Wood Mercury. The young lord in white silk is Water Metal. When yin and yang unite, their unmanifested *qi* intermingles in darkness and vagueness—only then can it be used. Once form appears, it becomes later heaven and cannot be used.\n\nLord Shangyang said: These eight lines of verse encompass the wondrous workings of an entire alchemical classic. The first line concerns the affairs of the *Zhen* palace, Wood Mercury, belonging to oneself. The second line concerns the affairs of the *Dui* palace, Lead, belonging to the other. The third line gives birth to beings; the fourth refines the elixir. The fifth line enters the chamber to begin work; the sixth guards against danger. The seventh line is the elixir’s ninefold transmutation; the eighth, the completion of three thousand merits. The immortal master composed this poem solely to point out the primordial true unified *qi*—the initial *qi* contained by the Great One. Should the scholar not seek a master?\n\n*Twelve \"Moon over the West River\" Verses—Symbolizing the Twelve Months*\nThe immortal master said: *West* is the direction of metal. *River* is the essence of water. *Moon* is the function of the elixir. The inner medicine is like the outer medicine; if the inner is open, the outer must also be open. The elixir’s essence harmonizes with like kinds—its nurturing employs two distinct functions. Within, there is the celestial true fire, blazing red in the furnace. Without, the outer furnace’s increase and decrease require diligent effort. No wonder is greater than the true seed.\n\nLord Daoguang said: The *Breaking Delusion Song* of the Gate of Yi states: *\"The Dao is within—set up the furnace; the tripod is without. The Dao is without—Kan and Li; lead and mercury are within.\"* This clarifies the two medicines, inner and outer. The outer medicine is the Golden Elixir. Its transformation occurs in the furnace of the two eights, taking no more than half a double-hour to mature. The inner medicine is the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir. Its transformation occurs within one’s own body, requiring a full ten months before the embryo can shed its mortal form and become a sage. Though the two medicines’ functions are somewhat alike, their fire times in practice are vastly different.\n\nWhen we disciples work on the outer elixir, at the moment of harmonizing the elixir’s essence, the slightest error prevents the great medicine from forming. When harmonizing the inner elixir’s essence, one must be most cautious to guard against danger. Though the inner elixir possesses celestial true fire, blazing red within the earthen crucible, one must still diligently adjust the outer furnace’s fire. Yet the endless transformations of the inner and outer true fires truly rely on the wondrousness of true lead. This substance alone can capture mercury and prevent it from flying away.\n\nMaster Ye Wenshu, failing to grasp this principle, claimed that the inner medicine is refined by true fire, while the outer medicine requires the addition of mundane fire. Alas! He had not received a master’s guidance and merely peered at the heavens through a tube. He did not understand that though the two medicines differ in being inner and outer, their function follows a single path.\n\nThe reason for inner and outer lies in this: a person’s body, endowed with the finest *qi* of heaven and earth, is born and entrusted to yin and yang to be cast into illusory form. Thus, within this single form, essence, *qi*, and spirit are primary. Spirit is born of *qi*, *qi* is born of essence, and essence is born of spirit. If a cultivator of the elixir clings to this body and practices within it, they do no more than refine the three substances of essence, *qi*, and spirit. Yet these three are all born of later heaven and earth, purely yin without yang. How could refining them enable one to transcend heaven and earth?\n\nMaster Zhongli said: *\"Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and marrow—these seven substances are all yin.\"*\n\nIt is further said: *\"To refine but a single substance is to nurture solitary yin.\"*\n\nThe sage knows that one’s true essence, born after heaven and earth, belongs to yin—difficult to seize, easy to lose. Thus, one must seek the primordial *qi* of prior heaven, capturing in a single moment the true yin and true yang, the twofold and eightfold substances of the same kind, to refine them into a single grain. This is called the Elixir of Supreme Yang, known as True Lead. Its creation lies without, hence it is called the Outer Medicine. Then, with this Yang Elixir, one seizes one’s own yin mercury, like a cat catching a mouse. The Yang Elixir is the mother-*qi* of heaven and earth, while one’s own mercury is the child-*qi* of heaven and earth. To subdue the child-*qi* with the mother-*qi*—is this not of the same kind? Its creation lies within, hence it is called the Inner Medicine.\n\nThereupon, borrowing the fire of yin-yang tally, one applies the methods of withdrawal and addition. After ten months, the work is complete: form transforms into *qi*, *qi* transforms into spirit, and spirit merges with the Dao. Ascending into the formless, one’s transformations become unfathomable. Thus, one transcends heaven and earth, stands beyond the realm of creation, and grasps heaven and earth to mold yin and yang—yet is not molded by yin and yang. This is the work of the primordial *qi* of prior heaven.\n\nSuch wondrous subtlety is unparalleled, for nothing surpasses the true seed. How could one use the ordinary lead, mercury, cinnabar, or fire of later heaven—impure substances of a different kind—as the Outer Medicine?\n\nScholars of the Dao must delve into the root and origin, meticulously distinguishing between the true and the false. Let none be deceived by fraudulent pretenders who feign lofty attainment to mislead later generations. Those who do so shall forever sink into the Three Wretched Realms.\n\nZiye said: *\"The Way of the Inner Elixir closely resembles the work of the Outer Medicine and furnace-fire. Generally, mercury cannot be subdued without lead. He who understands the outer work will easily grasp the inner.\"*\n\nShangyangzi said: *\"Those who cultivate the Dao must first thoroughly comprehend the true workings of the two yin and yang—inner and outer. Then, when entering the chamber to begin the work, success will come easily. The Inner Medicine is what one inherently possesses, while the Outer Medicine is what the body produces. The Inner Medicine resides within oneself, while the Outer Medicine emerges from one’s form. The Inner Medicine does not depart from one’s body, just as the Outer Medicine does not depart from one’s appearance. The Inner Medicine completes one’s nature, while the Outer Medicine fulfills both nature and life. The Inner Medicine is essence, the Outer Medicine is *qi*. Essence and *qi* do not part, hence they are called the true seed. Only when nature and life are cultivated together can one attain the rank of Heavenly Immortal.\"*\n\nThis Dao is most divine and sagely—lest one’s meager allotment prove insufficient to bear its marvels. When lead and mercury are harmonized, the work is not even a full morning’s labor, and soon the first signs of the Mysterious Pearl appear. If a determined practitioner refines this, why should they not dwell in the marketplace or court? The work is easy, the medicine not distant—yet to speak of it makes others laugh.\n\nDaoguang said: *\"When the Golden Elixir enters the mouth, one instantly ascends to sagehood—is this not most divine and sagely? The refinement takes but half an hour—is this not most simple and easy? It is found in every household, unrestricted by marketplace or court—is this not most near? Precisely because it is so near, to speak of it makes others laugh. Those who attain it need only fear lacking merit or virtue, forgetting their teacher, or turning from the Dao—such would be unworthy of its wonder.\"*\n\nZiye said: *\"The matter of the Golden Elixir is called divine and sagely because of its supreme efficacy. Its efficacy is like standing a pole to cast a shadow or calling into a valley to hear an echo—not some empty, illusory art. This Golden Elixir consists solely of lead and mercury: lead comes from without, mercury arises from within. Once the willing heart is discerned, the Mysterious Pearl takes form. The work is easy—why seek secluded mountains and marshes for refinement?\"*\n\nShangyangzi said: *\"The Way of the Returned Elixir lies in subduing the dragon and taming the tiger, stealing the creative power of heaven and earth—how wondrous and divine! Motionless in stillness, yet responsive when moved—how spiritually efficacious! Those who hear and believe, receiving and practicing diligently, are of great root and superior capacity. Those who hear and laugh in scorn are of meager allotment and poor fortune. When lead and mercury unite and the Mysterious Pearl appears, this is called the Golden Elixir. This Elixir is present in the marketplace and home, in daily use and nightly labor—inherently complete, without constraint. Yet foolish worldly people claim that those who cultivate the Dao must dwell in deep mountains, shun the marketplace, abandon wife and children, or sit in solitary inaction to be true practitioners. How could they know the workings of true yin and true yang?\"*\n\nThe White Tiger’s *First Scripture* is the supreme treasure, the divine water of the Flowery Pond, true gold. Thus, one knows the source of highest good runs deep—unlike ordinary medicinal substances.\n\nIf one wishes to refine the Nine Revolutions, one must first refine the self and master the heart. At the proper time, gather and stabilize the floating and sinking, advancing the fire while guarding against peril.\n\nDaoguang said: *\"The ‘first’ refers to the beginning. The First Scripture is the *qi* of the White Tiger’s initial crescent—this is not the art of chamber-room elixirs or dual cultivation. To speak of the twenty-four methods of the Three Peaks for gathering yin is to slander the Great Dao. Nine generations of ancestors will forever sink as lower ghosts, and one will face karmic retribution in this very life. The Dao cannot be slandered, just as heaven cannot be climbed by steps.\"*\n\nMoreover, the *qi* of True Unity in heaven is called the Water of True Unity; in the tiger, it is called the *qi* of the initial crescent. When refined in the Flowery Pond, it is called divine water—this is the supreme treasure of true gold. All these do not depart from the essence of True Unity, flowing through various places, hence their many different names. Yet each can accomplish creation.\n\nThe scripture says: *\"The highest good is like water.\"* The Water of True Unity is born before heaven and earth, hence it is called the highest good. Its source runs deep—unlike the impure substances of later heaven.\n\nThe Nine Revolutions refer to nine years of work after the ten-month gestation of the embryo is complete—this is the nine years of wall-facing practice of Bodhidharma. If one wishes to refine the wonder of the Nine Revolutions, one must first refine the self, stabilize the floating and sinking, and distinguish host from guest. Gather at the proper time, embrace the feminine without asserting the masculine, and thus avoid peril.\n\nRefining the fire for ten months, the form naturally transforms into qi, and qi transforms into spirit. Embracing the Origin and guarding the One, after nine years the work is complete—form and spirit both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth. The sages forcibly name this the *Nine Revolutions Golden Elixir of Great Return*.\n\nZiye said: *\"At sixteen, a man’s true essence flows; at fourteen, a woman’s heavenly water arrives.\"* When it first descends, is this the first essence or not? Ah! *On the road, meet a swordsman and present your blade; only when the lute finds a knowing ear may it be played*—the divine water is indeed the first essence.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The highest good is like water, benefiting all things without contention.\"* The True Person uses the first essence and divine water as metaphors, speaking of their power to give life, unlike other round or scattered substances.\n\nThe external medicine’s nine revolutions complete the cycle of fire. When the elixir ripens and the nine revolutions are to be achieved, refining the self and stabilizing the mind are essential.\n\nShangyangzi said: *\"The White Tiger is a difficult creature to tame; if used according to the Way, it cannot harm.\"* As a rare substance, if sought at the proper time, it must hold the destiny of a celestial immortal. This White Tiger’s first essence is forcibly named the *Primordial Unity Qi*.\n\nThe immortal masters’ teachings are too subtle, while Xue and Lu’s annotations are too detailed. If foolish people mistake this for bedroom arts or chamber elixir techniques, calamity will befall them. Only when a scholar understands the principle of *\"the moon emerging on the third day after geng,\"* may they seek the use of the *Flower Pool’s divine water*.\n\nThe Way of the Returning Elixir is easy to practice, but refining the self is most difficult. Thus, the immortal masters warn: refine the self first. Even Pure Yang said: *\"The returning elixir lies within a person, but one must first refine the self and await the proper time.\"* Why? Fire is the most numinous of things—beyond human comprehension, yet it knows first, like a witness to the budding flower. If even ordinary fire is so perceptive, how much more so the true fire, which is one’s own mercury? One must first refine this true fire, subdue this true dragon, prevent it from fleeing, and command it at will. Only then can the White Tiger be tamed to obtain the true gold of the supreme treasure.\n\nThe sagely masters devoted such care to this, fearing that later practitioners would fail to refine the self. Then, when the time arrives and the furnace is tended, not a single grain of the supreme treasure will be obtained—instead, peril and distress will follow. Those who cultivate the Way must first thoroughly master the work of refining the self.\n\nThe Cowherd and Weaver Girl’s love is a meeting of the Dao; the tortoise and snake naturally embody heaven’s decree. The toad and crow meet at the new moon, their beauty united; the two qi mutually support and revolve. This is the wondrous work of heaven and earth—who can fathom this profound source? When yin and yang are blocked and divided, how can they endure as long as heaven and earth?\n\nDaoguang said: *\"The Cowherd recognizes the Weaver Girl, meeting once a year. The great yang and great yin unite once a month. The tortoise and snake, coiled like dragons, support one another—all are moved by the two qi of yin and yang, the very root of the great Dao.\"* The workings of the golden elixir and great medicine are the same. The true Unity qi is subtle and formless; without the union of the two-eight yin and yang qi, how could it descend and take shape as a grain of millet? After obtaining the elixir and consuming it, without the binding of yin-yang talismanic fire, how could it transform into the golden liquid returning elixir?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"The turtledoves call to one another,\non the isle in the river.\nThe fair maiden,\nthe noble man’s good match.\nThe male does not dwell alone,\nthe female does not live in solitude.\"*\nHow profound! The Dark Warrior’s tortoise and snake coil together, illustrating that the female and male must mutually depend—this is the principle, what doubt remains? The immortal elder repeatedly emphasizes this chapter; those deeply versed in the Dao will grasp its meaning with intuition.\n\nZiye said: *\"The Cowherd and Weaver Girl are two celestial stars, meeting once a year at the Magpie Bridge on the seventh night. The tortoise and snake are creatures of the earth, yet they too can mate. The sun and moon meet at the new moon—all follow the Way of one yin and one yang seeking union.\"* In the wondrous work of elixir-making, if one has only solitary yin or widowed yang without a counterpart, can they not seek it?\n\nShangyangzi said: *\"The Cowherd and Weaver Girl are constellations; the toad and crow represent the sun and moon. The tortoise and snake are armored creatures, yet they too rely on the two qi of yin and yang to revolve.\"* Nowadays, people practice solitary yin or widowed yang, sitting alone in deep mountains, believing this is cultivation and can lead to longevity—how utterly mistaken! Do they not know that when yin and yang are blocked, creation cannot be accomplished, let alone the Way of the golden elixir?\n\nIf you wish to retain true lead and keep mercury close, the minister never leaves the household. Wood and metal are separated and cannot meet without cause—you must rely on the matchmaker to bring them together.\n\nWood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,\nMetal’s essence yearns for wood’s kindness.\nThey devour and embrace one another, yet grow closer—\nOnly then does the man realize he is with child.\n\nDaoguang said: *\"Lead is metal on the outside; mercury is wood within. The two are separated—only with the Yellow Dame’s mediation can the elixir be formed. Swallowed into the belly, it unites with one’s own mercury. Metal’s nature is fiercely upright, wood’s nature is gentle and compassionate. Their natures naturally love and yearn for one another, devouring and embracing, binding as husband and wife to conceive a child within the belly—hence it is said ‘with child.’\"* This Dao is wondrous indeed! If not for a person of compassion, virtue, and merit in aiding others, it would be nearly impossible to encounter.\n\nZiye said: *\"Mercury comes from oneself, but without lead, it cannot be subdued. Lead is born in the palace of Kun, so they are separated. To bring lead and mercury together, a matchmaker is indispensable.\"* The matchmaker serves to unite yin and yang. Things born of the same qi are kin—though separated, they long for one another and cannot be abandoned. Thus, wood’s nature cannot but love metal, and metal’s essence cannot but yearn for wood. Why? Because they both arise from the same qi. Without penetrating insight into yin and yang and profound understanding of creation, who could partake in this?\n\nMaster Shangyang said: True lead is born within the Cavern of Creation and dwells within the Body of Creation. If one cannot hold the heart and refine the self, mercury will flee. If one does not attend the furnace in due time, lead will fly. The \"household minister\" is none other than one’s own mercury. If refined to maturity, it can be commanded at will. Though wood loves metal in dutiful devotion, without wealth it cannot win its favor. Though metal yearns for wood with deep affection, without a matchmaker it cannot reach its beloved. Once the matchmaker brokers their union and wealth secures their joy, they naturally consume one another—thus the man conceives the embryo.\n\nIf one does not nurture with virtue or bestow kindness with benevolence, how can they be commanded when the moment arrives?\n\n*Whose house holds the maiden of sixteen?*\n*Where dwells the youth of twenty-seven?*\n*Self-styled \"wood’s essence\" and \"metal’s essence,\"*\n*Yet meeting earth, they form three lineages.*\n*With Ding’s refining fire lent further,*\n*Husband and wife at last unite in joy.*\n*The River Chariot dares not pause—*\n*It ascends to Kunlun’s peak.*\n\nDaoguang said: The maiden is wood’s essence, called mercury. The youth is metal’s essence, called lead. This speaks of lead and mercury within the earthen crucible, which must rely on the fire’s inner refinement and outer tempering to unite in joy. Thus, the tally of yin and yang’s fire must never pause; all phases of qi depend on the single heart. Transported to Kunlun’s summit, it is infused with nurturing warmth to form the Reverted Elixir.\n\nZiye said: Mercury belongs to yin, hence the maiden of sixteen. Lead belongs to yang, hence the youth of twenty-seven. Mercury is wood’s essence; lead is metal’s essence. With earth as matchmaker, the three lineages unite in marriage. Refined by Ding’s fire, lead and mercury merge, husband and wife conjoin. Fire’s nature is to rise, but the elixir, steamed by fire’s qi, finds the River Chariot’s path and soars to the Mud Pill.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: The maiden is mercury from the Li Palace; the youth is lead from the Kan. Earth is the agent that unites the two. Only with earth can metal and wood consummate their union, and the River Chariot ascend to Kunlun’s peak.\n\n*Seven returns—cinnabar reverts to its root.*\n*Nine reversions—golden nectar restores the true.*\n*Do not count the hours from Zi to Shen—*\n*Only when the Five Agents align is the standard met.*\n\n*It is but a single taste of quicksilver,*\n*Yet it courses through all the celestial stems.*\n*When yin and yang’s numbers are complete, it naturally attains the divine—*\n*How could its entry and exit ever leave the Mysterious Female?*\n\nDaoguang said: The nine reversions and seven returns do not depart from the numbers of heaven, earth, and the Five Agents. Those who count from Zi in the hour of Yin to Shen mistake the matter. \"Return\" means reverting to the root; \"reversion\" means restoring the origin. Quicksilver is mercury, mercury is the essence of the True One. In its first transformation, it becomes water in the north; in its second, cinnabar in the south; in its third, mercury in the east; in its fourth, metal in the west; in its fifth, the elixir in the center. This elixir is not born without heaven and earth, not produced without sun and moon, not perfected without the four seasons, not completed without the Five Agents, not achieved without the total number. Thus, coursing through all the celestial stems, with yin and yang’s numbers fulfilled, it naturally transforms and attains the divine.\n\nZiye said: Fire is the number seven; metal is the number nine. The mutual dependence of metal and fire is the essence of elixir-making. Metal does not revert without fire; fire does not return without metal. *The Dragon-Tiger Scripture* states: \"No alchemical art is more luminous than that of metal and fire.\" This is what it means. Metal within water is called quicksilver. The Inner Elixir’s completion does not depart from this single taste. Master its subtlety, and it naturally traverses all the celestial stems, transforming with the seasons and qi. Know that to grasp its wonder, one must rely on the Mysterious Female.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Cinnabar is mercury; golden nectar is lead. When metal returns to its nature, it is called the Reverted Elixir. Originally, it is but the primordial qi, born in the Cavern of Creation’s spring, hence named quicksilver. Without this single treasure, how could the elixir be formed? And without the Mysterious Female as its root, how could it enter and exit, transforming?\n\n*Within the male, the female’s essence is contained;*\n*Embracing yin, it holds fast to yang’s essence.*\n*When the two harmonize, the medicine is complete—*\n*It transmutes the soul’s spirit and the spirit’s soul.*\n\n*Trust in the single grain of golden elixir:*\n*Let the serpent swallow it, and it becomes a dragon.*\n*Let the chicken peck it, and it transforms into a phoenix,*\n*Soaring into the pure realm of True Yang.*\n\nDaoguang said: The male containing the female is the dragon’s latent qi. Embracing yin and holding yang is the tiger’s latent qi. When the two unite, the numinous elixir forms. Swallowed into the belly, it transmutes the yang soul to dissolve the yin spirit. A single grain, no larger than a millet seed—whether a chicken pecks or a serpent swallows it, both become dragons and phoenixes. Such is the elixir’s divine power.\n\nZiye said: Within yang there is yin; within yin there is yang. When yin and yang unite, the soul’s spirit conceives the sacred. Master Shangyang said: Though I appear male outwardly, within I am female. Though I appear white outwardly, within I am black. Yet within that yin, it paradoxically embraces yang’s essence. Only by using yang to refine yin is the great medicine completed. All things that obtain this numinous medicine can transform—how much more so the perfected person?\n\n*When heaven and earth pass through closure and openness,*\n*Morning and evening must recognize the signs of Layering and Sprouting.*\n*Like spokes converging at the hub, like rivers flowing to the sea—*\n*The wonder lies in the art of withdrawal and addition.*\n\n*Attain the One, and all things are complete.*\n*Do not divide north, south, east, or west.*\n*Lessen and lessen again—guard your prior work.*\n*The life-treasure must not be trifled with.*\n\nDaoguang said: At the beginning of firing, labor at the signs of Layering and Sprouting, but rest when the work is nearly done. Day and night, move the tally of fire into the crucible, like a wheel’s spokes converging at the hub, like the hundred rivers flowing to the sea. In such withdrawal and addition lies the essence of the True One’s qi. The One qi generates yin and yang; yin and yang generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Five Agents; the Five Agents generate the myriad things—all are transformations of the True One’s qi.\n\nThus, the essence of the True One is the parent of Heaven and Earth, the ancestor of yin and yang, the origin of the Four Images, the root of the Five Agents, and the foundation of the myriad things. Attain this One, and all affairs are complete. Lessen and lessen again, only then can the wonder of the One be fully grasped.\n\nFor the One takes form through the movement of yin and yang’s fire. Once swallowed and returned to the Five Viscera, as before, circulate the yin tally and yang fire to guard prior work. Be vigilant against peril, cautious of danger; do not act lightly, lest the life-treasure, the mysterious pearl, be lost.\n\nZiye said: When yin and yang have merged, it is the time to apply the fire. The convergence of spokes at the hub is the work of obtaining the medicine. At this moment, the primordial chaos returns to the Great Ultimate. There is no need to divide the limits of north, south, east, or west—only to watch over the barriers. If the mind stirs even slightly, guard the prior work. Should one indulge in momentary ardor, the toil of days past is forgotten, and the great affair is abandoned. Thus, the Way must not be trifled with.\n\nShangyangzi said: Those who undertake great cultivation should reflect on the difficulty of learning the Dao and refining the elixir. This single grain of elixir is not easily obtained. Only after enduring countless hardships and toils is it attained. Once obtained, this life-treasure must be cherished even more—secluded in quietude, nurtured and tempered with care. To \"lessen and lessen again\" means to extinguish desire until desire is forgotten, to rouse effort until effort is forgotten. Before obtaining the elixir, practice the conduct of a true immortal. After obtaining the elixir, hold the mind of one who has attained nothing, so that all things become irrelevant, and no peril remains—until the work is complete, the fire sufficient, and vigilance may ease.\n\nAt the winter solstice, yang returns with the first light. Over thirty days, one yang line is added. In the moon’s cycle, the *Fu* hexagram appears at the new moon’s morning tide, and the *Qian* hexagram ends at the full moon’s *Gou* omen. The day further divides into cold and heat: yang revives at midnight, and at noon, the *Gou* hexagram’s single yin arises. In refining the medicine, one must know dawn and dusk.\n\nDaoguang said: At the winter solstice, yang is born, forming the *Fu* hexagram. After thirty days, another yang line is added, becoming *Lin*, *Tai*, *Dazhuang*, and *Guai*. By the fourth month, six yang lines form pure *Qian*, the time of yang fire. When yang reaches its peak, yin is born. At the summer solstice, yin is born, forming the *Gou* hexagram. Over thirty days, one yin line is added, becoming *Dun*, *Pi*, *Guan*, and *Bo*. By the tenth month, six yin lines form pure *Kun*, the time of the yin tally. When yin reaches its peak, yang is reborn. This cycle repeats endlessly—such is the fire timing of a year. The sages condensed a year’s fire timing into a single month: at the new moon, the *Fu* hexagram appears, and every two and a half days, a yang line is added, until the fifteenth day, when pure *Qian* is formed. On the sixteenth day, yin is born, forming *Gou*. They further condensed a year’s timing into a single day, dividing it into cold and heat, yin and yang, warmth and coolness—the four seasonal qi. Thus, at midnight, the *Fu* hexagram’s yang is born, and at noon, the *Gou* hexagram’s yin arises. The yang fire and yin tally follow the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s yin-yang ascent and descent.\n\nZiye said: The return of the first yang at the winter solstice is like the time when the medicine is born within the body. At the end of a month, this qi is observed—hence the saying \"thirty days.\" The addition of one yang line is the *Fu* hexagram within the month. From *Fu* to *Qian*, when *Qian* is full, *Gou* follows—this is the time when the medicine has passed. The golden meets the distant full moon’s omen. The day further divides into cold and heat, marking the qi timing of refining the medicine within a day. Midnight is *Fu*, noon is *Gou*. Those who refine the medicine must clearly know the time of the heart’s single yang and the time of Heaven and Earth’s single yang, without the slightest error—only then can the golden elixir be hoped for.\n\nShangyangzi said: The tidal timing of the winter solstice is the work of Heaven and Earth’s creation. When lead sees *gui* born, it is the work of the human body’s creation. As Heaven and Earth’s yang revives and the myriad things take form, the true lead appears when the body’s yang is born. If not gathered and refined at this time, the moment passes, the medicine becomes turbid, and the substance is not true. Once this single grain of elixir is obtained and the true mercury is harmonized with oneself to form *Qian*, the yang fire is applied. *Gou* and *Xun* receive the yin tally, and the daily circulation of one’s mercury solidifies the yang essence—hence *Gou*, symbolizing the arrival of a single yin. Here, oral transmission is required. Without discerning the Five Agents and Four Images, how can one distinguish cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver? If the fire timing of elixir refinement has never been heard of, one may prematurely claim seclusion. Unwilling to reflect on one’s own errors, one instead teaches mistaken paths to others, leading them astray into eternal delusion. To resent and deceive with such a heart—how can one bear it?\n\nDaoguang said: Though there are ten thousand volumes of elixir classics, the wonder lies in the *Cantong Qi* and the *Song of the Tripod*. The achievement of the golden elixir is beyond the understanding of scholars in this world. If by chance a foolish teacher points to heterodox paths, one may entertain thoughts of escape or omission. Before learning the method of exhaling the old and inhaling the new, one may boast of soaring clouds and misty flights—self-aggrandizing, modeling oneself for others. Without repentance for one’s own ignorance, one misleads others into the depths of delusion. Such heartlessness and misconduct invite dire retribution. Moreover, to slander earlier texts and fabricate discussions—how can one bear such cruelty?\n\nZiye said: As the saying goes, \"Those above the middle can be spoken to of higher things; those below the middle cannot be spoken to of higher things.\"\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Lead, mercury, cinnabar, silver, and earth constitute the Five Agents of the Reverted Elixir. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li form the Four Images of creation and transformation. Fire, as an element, is most extraordinary and numinous—it laughs at the burning of firewood to foretell a guest’s arrival, and at night it testifies to the blossoming of flowers to augur wealth and joy. If even ordinary fire possesses such qualities, true fire is all the more spiritually efficacious. Thus, it gives life to beings and to immortals, its power rivaling that of creation itself.\n\nYet because foolish disciples have not encountered a true master, they remain unaware of the Way of the Reverted Elixir. Instead, they rely on empty nihilism, reckless eloquence, and deceitful sophistry to mislead their contemporaries. Having strayed so far, they refuse to reflect on their misconduct or concern themselves with the consequences of sin and blessing. Since receiving my master’s instruction, whenever I encounter such people, I wish to admonish them and guide them back to the correct path. Yet those of shallow understanding are stubborn and difficult to teach.\n\nAlas! Master Zhuang spoke truly when he said, *\"Those whom Heaven would mutilate.\"* Virtue cultivated surpasses eight hundred deeds; hidden merits accumulate to three thousand. Only when one equalizes self and others, kin and foe, does one fulfill the original vow of the immortals. Tigers, rhinoceroses, blades, and weapons cannot harm them; the inescapable fire of impermanence cannot bind them. Once the sacred talisman descends, they ascend to Heaven, securely riding the phoenix chariot and the simurgh carriage.\n\nMaster Daoguang said: After nine years of embracing the One, merit is fulfilled and work complete. Self and others are both forgotten—what fear remains of blades, weapons, tigers, or rhinoceroses? The sacred talisman descends from Heaven, and the body soars to the Jade Palace. This is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name established.\n\nZiye said: At first, one acts; now, one enters non-action. The realm of non-action is where true immortals dwell.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Those who cultivate the Way must constantly refine their virtue and accumulate hidden merits. No matter how many demonic obstacles arise, they remain devoted to their practice. With such a resolve, even long-standing enmities naturally dissolve—how could blades, weapons, tigers, or rhinoceroses harm them? On the day their work is complete, they await the celestial melody and ascend in broad daylight. Masters like Zhang Daoling, Xu Jingyang, and Ge Xianweng all ascended to Heaven in daylight after achieving the Dao. Yet people today claim that immortals are born from seeds sown in past lives, cultivated over eons, and that their attainment is beyond human reach—how grievously they misunderstand! Did they not know that Ge Xian attained the Dao only after the age of sixty? His actions were beyond confusion, and only then did he succeed.\n\nAlas! Laozi said: *\"The good scholars of old were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating, so deep as to be unknowable.\"* How wondrous! This unknowable depth refers to the time of refining the Great Elixir, when one practices the Way of action. Precisely because it is so deep and unknowable, one’s deeds surpass eight hundred and one’s merits reach three thousand.\n\nA *West River Moon* lyric, symbolizing the intercalary month:\nThe Elixir is the supreme treasure of the physical form,\nRefined, it transforms endlessly.\nFurther, one investigates the true essence of nature,\nMastering the wondrous function of non-birth.\nNo need to wait for future lives—\nBefore one’s eyes, one attains the Buddha’s spiritual powers.\nSince the Dragon Girl applied this work,\nWho since has followed in her footsteps?\n\nMaster Daoguang said: This Way is precisely the intent behind Bodhidharma’s coming from the West. It has been transmitted from patriarch to patriarch. Thus, the Sixth Patriarch emerged from the lineage of Cao and Han, and Mazu referred to it as the *\"Water of the West River\"*—all pointing to this same truth. Yet later generations, lacking the heart to practice, merely discuss it with their mouths. The Buddhas and patriarchs, powerless to do otherwise, resort to staffs, blows, shouts, and a hundred metaphors to guide those of superior capacity to practice the Way, those of middling capacity to awaken to their nature, and those of lesser capacity to remember their words.\n\nWhat I seek is for people first to preserve their nature, then to cultivate life and preserve nature—this is the work of refining the Jade Liquid and tempering the self. Cultivating life is the Way of the Golden Liquid’s Reverted Elixir. Fools, however, claim that in my teaching, a single word from the Chan school instantly awakens one to Buddhahood. This is deceptive nonsense—how could such a thing be? Know this: the Golden Elixir is the supreme and wondrous vehicle of my teaching.\n\nZiye said: *\"The Elixir is the supreme treasure of the physical form\"*—this single phrase exhausts the essence of the Great Elixir. What need is there for more?\n\nMaster Shangyang said: The Tathāgata’s wondrous physical form arises from the ordinary physical form of the world. Thus, the supreme treasure of the Golden Elixir is not found in remote mountains or desolate valleys but is sought within the dharmas of the world. Once this Elixir is achieved, its transformations are boundless. First, one must thoroughly investigate one’s own nature before becoming a child of the Buddha and proceeding to higher matters.\n\nThus, Master Daoguang said: *\"Refining nature is tempering the self; cultivating life is the Reverted Elixir.\"* This is not about cultivating blessings for future lives but about attaining Buddhahood in this very existence. Once, when the World-Honored One expounded the Dharma on Vulture Peak, five thousand left their seats, yet the Dragon Girl, presenting a precious pearl before the World-Honored One, attained Buddhahood.\n\nFive quatrains, symbolizing the Five Agents of lead, mercury, cinnabar, silver, and earth:\nThough you comprehend the true suchness of nature,\nYou cannot escape casting off this body only to enter another.\nWhy then undertake the refinement of the Great Medicine?\nTo swiftly transcend the leakless and become a true person.\n\nMaster Daoguang said: In the Dharma gate of the Tathāgata, awakening to nature comes first, yet this is not the supreme wondrous meaning. In the Way of the Golden Elixir, obtaining the Medicine is paramount, but one must first refine nature. To regard awakening to nature as sufficient is utterly mistaken. To seek the Medicine without refining nature risks peril.\n\nZiye said: The *Book of Changes* states: *\"Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, to reach destiny.\"* This is what it means to cultivate both nature and life—this is the Way of one yin and one yang. If one only awakens to nature without completing life, this is the illness of partial yin and partial yang, leading to the affliction of casting off this body only to enter another.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: People today do not understand why later immortals often cite the teachings of Śākyamuni—to urge the necessity of cultivating both nature and life. Instead, they slander them, claiming that after achieving the Dao, one must still study Buddhism. How deluded they are! Those who comprehend the true suchness of nature yet do not refine the Elixir cannot become Buddhas.\n\nThus, the preface states: The method of breath retention closely resembles seated meditation. If practiced diligently, it may lead to samādhi and spirit departure. Yet since spirit belongs to yin and its dwelling is difficult to secure, one must perpetually employ the method of relocation—without attaining the Way of returning mercury and gold, how could one reverse yang and transform the bones to ascend in broad daylight? Those who cast off this body only to enter another cannot escape leakage.\n\nThe Way of refining life that directly enters the formless Great Medicine is the true cultivation of life. Cultivating both nature and life, form and spirit attain wondrous union. Rebirth, possession, relocation, and former dwelling—these are but the four fruitless paths. Should one master the taming of the dragon and the subduing of the tiger, how long would the house of true gold ever wither?\n\nDaoguang said: Rebirth and possession are the paths of those clinging to emptiness. Taming the dragon and subduing the tiger are the marvels of the Returned Elixir.\n\nZiye said: The Way of the Golden Elixir, once attained, is eternally secure. A body exists beyond the body, hidden and revealed beyond measure—unlike the rebirth, possession, or obstinate emptiness of lesser practitioners.\n\nShangyang said: The four fruits refer to *srotaāpanna*, *sakṛdāgāmin*, *anāgāmin*, and *arhat*. Rebirth and possession, as when the Fifth Patriarch entered the womb of Lady Zhou, may yet allow for cultivation in the next life, for one retains the thread of the Dao and does not lose awareness. But should one lose the human form even once, ten thousand kalpas of saṃsāra await.\n\nThe method of inspecting form, holding breath, and contemplating spirit begins with hardship but later becomes smooth. Though one may swiftly traverse ten thousand lands, alas, the old house must still be relocated.\n\nDaoguang said: All these practices are but side doors of Daoist teachings. Following them, one cannot behold the Tathāgata.\n\nZiye said: These words describe the method of the yin spirit, which suffers the affliction of relocating the old house—unlike the Way of the yang spirit and the Golden Elixir.\n\nShangyang said: Breath retention and breath cultivation are but a single yin. Even after ten thousand kalpas, one ultimately falls into emptiness and annihilation—this is not the Way.\n\n*The Biography of Lü Dongbin* records: One day, Dongbin transformed into a Daoist and wandered to the Kaixian Temple on Mount Lu, where he saw the monk Fazhen seated in meditation for two seven-day periods, his precepts and conduct exemplary. The Daoist asked: \"Can seated meditation complete the Way?\"\n\nFazhen replied: \"Yes.\"\n\nThe Daoist said: \"The Buddha’s precepts deem greed, anger, and delusion most grave. When you sit, you claim to have no mind, yet when you encounter things, you cannot forget them even briefly. Should attachment arise, the four afflictions surge uncontrollably. If you wish to sit upright, first refine the mind. Once the mind is refined, subdue the qi. Once qi is subdued, though you sleep all day, the Way is within—how could it depend solely on sitting?\"\n\nFazhen had yet to awaken. The Daoist then led him through the meditation hall, where they saw a monk fast asleep. The Daoist asked Fazhen: \"What does this monk usually do?\"\n\nFazhen said: \"He sits to accumulate merit, to perfect Buddhahood.\"\n\nThe Daoist said: \"Sit here for a moment, and observe this monk’s seated practice.\" After a long while, Fazhen saw a small red snake, over three inches long, emerge from the crown of the sleeping monk’s head. It slithered down the bed’s left leg to the floor, roaming everywhere, eating his phlegm and saliva. Then it climbed into the chamber pot to drink before departing through the window. It crossed a small ditch, circled the flowers as if admiring them, then attempted to cross another ditch. Finding the water too high, it turned back. The Daoist, anticipating its return, planted a small knife in its path. The snake recoiled in fear, found another route, and reached the bed’s right leg, ascending back into the monk’s crown.\n\nThe sleeping monk suddenly awoke and addressed the Daoist and Fazhen: \"I just had a dream. Let me tell you both. First, I exited through the left gate and encountered an exquisite vegetarian feast, which I ate. Then I came upon fine wine and drank it. Lifting my robe, I tried to cross a small river outside the gate, but the water suddenly rose, preventing me. I turned back and encountered a bandit who tried to kill me. I fled by a shortcut and reentered through the right gate—then I awoke.\"\n\nThe Daoist and Fazhen laughed heartily and departed, telling Fazhen: \"The bed’s legs were the gates, phlegm and saliva the feast, urine the wine, the ditch the river, the flowers and trees the beautiful women, and the blade the bandit. Human dreams and illusions are as false as this—can one truly attain Buddhahood through sitting?\"\n\nFazhen asked: \"What was the snake?\"\n\nThe Daoist replied: \"This monk’s nature is often filled with anger, which has transformed and manifested as a snake. One day, when he closes his eyes in death, he will be reborn as a snake. Should he not fear this?\"\n\nI am Lord Lü, and seeing your sincerity, I have come to instruct you.\" Fazhen then followed him, and their whereabouts became unknown.\n\nThose who sit rigidly in pursuit of Buddhahood—do they not feel shame when they see this?\n\nThe Buddhist teachings guide people toward the Land of Ultimate Bliss, yet that bliss is but the Golden Realm. For the most part, only this form holds true reality; the other two are not genuine and are but vain speculations.\n\nDaoist Guang said: \"The Dao has no self or other—it is simply One.\"\n\nZiye said: \"Gold is the treasure of all things. The more it is refined, the harder it becomes, enduring for eons without decay. What the Buddhists call the *Great Awakened Golden Immortal* is none other than the Dao of the Golden Elixir.\"\n\nMaster Shangyang said: \"Ultimate Bliss is neither coming nor going, neither arising nor ceasing. One must churn the long river into butter and pour the purest ghee to anoint the crown—this is the Golden Elixir of the Buddhists.\"\n\nThe sutra states: *\"There is only one Dharma-vehicle; the other two are not true.\"*\n\nThe immortal masters point out that among those who cultivate within form, only the Dao of the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir can lead to Buddhahood—there is no other way. As the common saying goes: *\"To align with the sagely Dao, one must seek diligently within it.\"* If one inverts daily practice to seek it, even the dust and sand of the earth will turn to treasure.\n\nDao Guang said: \"True lead and true mercury are not apart from daily practice. If one inverts and cultivates them, the entire earth becomes supreme treasure.\"\n\nZiye said: \"The mechanism of inversion has been fully revealed in the preceding scroll. Is there no jade within the stone? It awaits one who knows its worth.\"\n\nShangyangzi said: \"The Dao is present in daily conduct.\" The ancient sages declared: *\"Day and night are as one in practice.\"* Those who engage in great cultivation must seek diligently within it, pondering and discussing its depths. Only when a true master points out the workings of creation does one realize that even dust and sand may become treasure.\n\n*Commentary on the Third Scroll of the \"Awakening to Reality\" of the Perfected Purple Yang concludes.*\n\n**Postscript by the Perfected Purple Yang**\n\nNow, human life arises from delusive attachments that give form to the self. With self comes suffering; without self, whence would suffering arise? To escape suffering, nothing surpasses embodying the supreme Dao. To embody the supreme Dao, nothing surpasses illuminating the original mind.\n\nThus, the mind is the essence of the Dao, and the Dao is the function of the mind. If one can examine the mind and observe the nature, the luminous essence will naturally manifest, and the effortless function will naturally unfold. Without exerting effort, one instantly transcends to the other shore. How could this be achieved unless the mind-mirror shines clearly and the spirit-pearl radiates brilliance, such that all phenomena instantly dissolve, not a speck of dust adheres, and the source of mind remains free—utterly beyond birth?\n\nYet for those who illuminate the mind and embody the Dao, the body cannot burden their nature, nor can circumstances disturb their reality. How then could blades or weapons harm them? How could tigers or rhinoceroses endanger them? How could great fires or floods cause concern? The enlightened one’s mind is like a bright mirror: it reflects but does not retain, responds to circumstances but does not initiate. Thus, they overcome phenomena without injury.\n\nThis is the wondrous Dao of the supreme and perfect truth. Originally, the Dao had no name—sages imposed one. Originally, the Dao had no words—sages spoke them. Yet if names and words were silenced, later generations would have no means to recognize its essence and return to reality. Therefore, sages established teachings and set forth words to reveal the Dao. Thus, the Dao is made manifest through words, and words are forgotten in return to the Dao.\n\nAlas, this Dao is most wondrous and subtle, yet the world’s people, dull in root-nature, cling to the existence of the body, loathing death and delighting in life. Thus, they ultimately struggle to awaken. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, pitying their attachments, employed the arts of cultivating life to align with their desires, guiding them gradually. Since the essence of cultivating life lies in the Golden Elixir, and the essence of the Golden Elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond, the teachings of the *Dao De Jing* and *Yin Fu Jing* flourished in the world—because people delight in life.\n\nYet their words are veiled and their principles profound. Though scholars recite their texts, none comprehend their meaning. Without encountering a perfected one to transmit oral instructions, even if one conjectures a hundred ways, they will never achieve its merit or accomplish its work.\n\nHow rare it is that among scholars as numerous as ox hairs, those who truly comprehend are as scarce as unicorn horns. In the year *jiyou* of the previous cycle, I, Boduan, encountered a master in Chengdu who transmitted the method of the Elixir. That very year, my patron passed away, and thereafter, whenever I transmitted the teachings to others, disaster struck within half a month—three times in all. Recently, I recalled my master’s warning: *\"One day, if someone comes to free you from your bonds, you may transmit the teachings to them; otherwise, you are not permitted.\"* Later, wishing to sever my name from the registers of the mundane world, yet fearing that people would not believe in this Way, I composed this *Awakening to Reality*, setting forth the origins and culmination of the Elixir Medicine.\n\nOnce completed, seekers arrived in droves, their intentions earnest upon reading it. Unable to bear their eagerness, I selected a few to instruct. Yet those I taught possessed neither great influence nor strength, nor the capacity to uphold peril or rescue the drowning, nor the boldness to transcend convention, nor the benevolence to illuminate the Dao. After the first two misfortunes, my heart remained oblivious; only after the third did I awaken to my past errors. Thus I know: the Great Elixir’s method is utterly simple and effortless. Even the dullest and most ignorant, if they practice it, may instantly ascend to the realm of sages. Therefore, Heaven guards it in secrecy, forbidding its reckless transmission to the unworthy. Yet I, Boduan, disregarded my master’s words and repeatedly divulged Heaven’s mysteries. Because of this bodily existence, I have suffered repeated calamities—so swift and divine is Heaven’s admonition. How dare I not tremble with fear and reproach myself?\n\nFrom this day forward, I shall seal my lips and bind my tongue. Even if cauldrons boil before me and blades press upon my neck, I shall never speak of it again. Within this *Awakening to Reality*, the songs and verses on the Great Elixir, its medicines, and the subtleties of the firing times are all exhaustively set forth. Those with a predisposition for the immortal arts, upon reading it, will find their wisdom and discernment naturally clarified. They may follow the text to grasp its meaning—what need is there for my humble oral transmission? In this way, it is Heaven’s gift, not my presumptuous dissemination.\n\nAs for the songs and eulogies at the end of the work, they expound the method of seeing one’s nature—this is the very \"wondrous awakening of non-doing\" spoken of above. Yet the Way of non-doing takes equanimity as its heart; though it reveals profound secrets, it ultimately bears no fault. Alas, ordinary beings differ in the depth of their karmic obstructions and the sharpness of their innate capacities. Though they hear the same teaching, their interpretations diverge wildly. Thus, the Dharma treasures expounded by Śākyamuni and Mañjuśrī are none other than the One Vehicle, yet listeners, according to their faculties, naturally form the distinctions of the Three Vehicles.\n\nIf, hereafter, a person of keen and swift nature encounters this work, they will recognize that Boduan has grasped the supreme, wondrous essence of the Mahāyāna as transmitted by Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch. Through a single phrase, they may awaken to the myriad dharmas. But if residual habits persist, they may revert to middling or lesser views—this is not Boduan’s fault.\n\nWritten on the day *wuyin* of the month *wuyin* in the first year of the *Yuanfeng* reign, *wuwu* cycle, by Zhang Boduan, styled Pingshu, of Tiantai, in his second preface.",

In his youth, he studied for the imperial examinations but was exiled to the military registers of Lingnan due to a criminal offense. During the Zhiping era, my late grandfather, the *Longtu* Duke Shen, served as military commissioner of Guilin and recruited Zhang to his staff to manage confidential affairs. When the Duke was transferred to other posts, Zhang followed him. After the Duke passed away in Chengdu, Zhang wandered through Qin and Long, and eventually served Ma Mo of Fufeng in Hedong. When Ma was summoned to the capital, Zhang entrusted this book to him before his departure, saying: \"All I have learned in my life is contained herein. I hope you will circulate it, for there may be those who, upon reading it, will grasp its meaning.\"\n\nMa later became Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, and Zhang Lutan of Nanyang served as Registrar of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. Lutan said: \"I am the son-in-law of the *Longtu* Duke.\" Believing Lutan could comprehend his teachings, Ma transmitted the book to him. Lutan, in turn, passed it to my late father, the *Baowen* Duke. At the time, I was but a child, yet I secretly took and read it, though I could not comprehend it.\n\nWhen my father served as military commissioner of Qin, Wang Zhen, a minister of Yangping, was in his staff. Wang mentioned that his elder brother, Master Chongxi, had studied the Dao and, having encountered Liu Haichan, obtained the art of the Golden Elixir. Chongxi remarked that no Daoist in the world could fathom this teaching except Zhang Pingshu. The difficulty of attaining the Dao, he said, was such that only those of great power could succeed. Chongxi later journeyed to Luoyang to visit the wealthy Han Gong, relying on his assistance to complete his work.\n\nAt the time, I was young and full of vigor; though I heard his words, I paid them little heed and did not inquire who this \"Pingshu\" might be. In recent years, as my vitality has waned with age, I have gradually turned to the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi for self-cultivation. Someone transmitted to me the art of the Golden Elixir, saying: \"The spirit is the essence of life; the body is the abode of the spirit. The Dao preserves the spirit; the art secures the body. When the spirit is whole and the body firm, one may come and go at will.\"\n\nAfter divining an auspicious day and taking vows, the transmission was completed. The master then said to me: \"The Great Return Elixir of Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Golden Fluid is a secret treasured by the highest sages and must not be lightly disclosed. In the future, when you meet those to whom you wish to transmit it, first adhere to the sworn covenant, then require them to cultivate it themselves. Only after they have achieved success may you carefully select and entrust it to them. This is to ensure that you first experience the process yourself before instructing later disciples, so that when they engage in the work of withdrawal and augmentation, they may avoid peril. Thus, the Dao of perfecting both form and spirit will be made manifest. From ancient times to the present, all transmissions have followed this pact; those who violate it will surely incur heavenly retribution. Do you not know that Pingshu, having transmitted to unworthy recipients, suffered three calamities? You must exert yourself and take heed.\"\n\nHe further recounted the origins of his transmission, stating that he had received it from an extraordinary person in Chengdu—could this not have been Haichan? Moreover, Chongxi’s account of the difficulty of completing the elixir, and his assertion that none of the so-called Daoists of the world were worthy of approval except Pingshu alone, aligned perfectly with what I had once heard from Zhen. Thereupon, I took up this book and read it, finally awakening to its meaning. I also examined the transmitted works of Master Lü’s *Qinyuan Chun* and Haichan’s poems and lyrics, finding not a single word that did not resonate with it. Thus, I knew that its source and lineage were well-founded.\n\nToday, many enthusiasts collect this work, yet the texts vary considerably in wording and structure. I suspect that when it was first composed, it had not yet been refined, and copies had already begun to circulate. I have compared and corrected over twenty discrepancies, the most egregious being a verse that originally read:\n*\"No sooner do you see the sprout appear than you must swiftly gather it;*\n*If you encounter the distant full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\"*\nThis was later amended to:\n*\"When lead sees the *gui* phase arise, you must swiftly gather it;*\n*If gold encounters the waxing moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\"*\nThis revision completes the elixir formula, making it evident that the transmitted versions were imperfect in their phrasing and intent.\n\nAnother variant includes a quatrain titled *\"Awakening to Reality as Such,\"* which I have replaced with the analogy of Ou Ye forging a sword. Zhang Pingshu himself wrote in the *Postscript to the Awakening to Reality*: \"The verses in this *Awakening to Reality* sing of the Great Elixir, the ingredients, the firing times, and the subtle secrets—nothing is left unaddressed. By studying them, one may follow the text to grasp the meaning. Without these poems, how could one fathom the wonders of transmuting metal and wood? The writing is concise yet the principles profound; thus, I have composed this work to bring the matter to completion. Only then can the intent of returning metal and wood to their original state be brilliantly deduced. Once the Great Elixir is achieved, the Sacred Embryo may be formed.\"\n\nScholars should know that while this book has been widely transmitted, only my family’s version is authentic, for it was personally entrusted by Pingshu himself. Though I have received it, my capacity is insufficient; I must seek like-minded companions to bring it to fruition. This is why I entrust it to you.",

      "translated_text": "The Yin Way spurns the nine-and-one,\nDefiling the primordial womb with chaos.\nThe arts are myriad,\nA thousand paths, ten thousand more.\n\nMaster Peng says: The world does not comprehend the fundamental origin of the Great Dao, and thus all are but side doors and crooked paths. These belong to many kinds, all deviant ways. They violate heavenly principle, disrupt the utmost truth, openly defy the words of the Yellow Emperor, and wholly lose the intent of the Old Master. What was meant to grant eternal life instead harms one’s existence.\n\nElder Zhongli says: The meaning of \"the gate that gives me life is the door that takes it\"—how profound! The loftiest sages have spoken of it, yet none below can bear the burden. Why? Simply because the world clings to self in cultivation, and thus the thousand paths and hundred byways are nothing but side doors.\n\nThe Immortal Elder, in compassion, spoke plainly of seeking the very source of life’s origin—was this not revealing too much of heaven’s mechanism? For mortals come from the realm of karmic consciousness and depart through it as well. The solitary yang flees and is lost; though the form is male, the body is all yin. If one clings to the self in cultivation, how can one return to the origin and revert to the root? Unable to return to the origin and revert to the root, how then can one reverse yang and transform the bones?\n\nThus, those of great practice seek primordial true lead and must seek it from the very place where one first received qi and took form. Only then can the primordial true unity of qi be obtained, to return to the origin and revert to the root. Such is the way for men and women in cultivation.\n\nFor women who cultivate immortality, the breasts are where the qi of life resides, and the method is even simpler. Thus, men cultivate immortality by refining qi, while women cultivate immortality by refining form. Women first accumulate qi in the breasts, then set the cauldron and establish the furnace, practicing the Great Yin method of refining form. This path is most easily accomplished, for it holds wondrous principles.\n\nIn the Xuanhe era, Lü Dongbin traveled to Wuxing and encountered a courtesan named Zhang Zhennu. Though her beauty was radiant and her bearing graceful, her nature favored simplicity. Though fallen into the wind and dust, each evening she bathed, changed clothes, lit incense at the stove, and prayed to heaven, earnestly seeking liberation. Dongbin, disguised as a scholar, visited her. When Zhennu saw him, his bearing was extraordinary, and she deeply revered him.",

Moreover, each night you pray to heaven. What is it you truly seek?”\n\nZhennu said, “Having lost myself to this life, what else could I do? Yet I reflect: since entering this gate, I have recklessly applied powder and rouge, passing falsehood for truth, singing wanton songs, turning sorrow into mirth. I am but a sack of foul pus, using artifice to deceive others. Each time I regret how foolish men fail to honor their own worth—passing my door, they see me as a flower, their hearts ensnared, their wills entangled, unable to let go. Not only do they squander their wealth, many even lose their lives. Though I feign delight in these encounters, I feel the weight of my sin. That is why I pray morning and night, seeking early release from this gate.”\n\nThe scholar said, “What is your aspiration? Why not cultivate the Dao?”\n\nZhennu replied, “Trapped in this place, where would I find a teacher?”\n\nThe scholar said, “I could be your teacher.”\n\nZhennu immediately bowed and kowtowed. The scholar said, “Come again, and then it may be so.” With that, he left.\n\nDay and night, Zhennu awaited his return, filled with remorse. She wrote:\n\n*Met my teacher so long ago,\nYet not a word of truth he’d show.\nHow I long to sit once more,\nRegretting time now lost before,\nTill now, my heart is wracked with woe.*\n\nBefore she could finish, the scholar suddenly appeared. Seeing what she had written, he continued the verse:\n\n*The Dao holds no clever art,\nBut here’s the method, take this part.\nSit still from midnight till noon’s light,\nLet qi rise past spine’s twin gates,\nThrough Kunlun’s peak—its path takes flight.\nWhen you feel its strength arise,\nThink of me, and realize.*\n\nOverjoyed, Zhennu received from him the Great Yin method of refining form and the Great Elixir technique. From then on, her spirit and qi flourished, as if a great awakening had dawned. She knew not how much more was secretly transmitted, nor did she ever speak of it to others.\n\nAt their parting, she composed *Stepping into the Toad Palace*:\n\n*Kan and Li, Kun and Dui divide the Zi and Wu,\nFirst recognize your own ancestral root.\nThe thunder shakes the mountain, rain descends,\nTo wash and nurture the yellow sprout from earth’s embrace.\nSeize the golden essence, bind it fast,\nDistinguish jia and geng—let dragon and tiger rise.\nWhen asked who taught you this way,\nSay only: the master’s surname is Lü.*\n\nOnly then did Zhennu realize that Lü had first examined her practice before entrusting her with the teachings. Gold and jade heaped together must not be shared, nor even with one’s closest kin. For careless leaks and reckless disclosures bring calamity upon the body, misfortune upon nine generations, disaster upon the household, and ill fortune upon descendants. Nor is this all—one may suffer myriad karmic retributions, sinking into the nine hells, forever barred from rebirth. Guard this warning well; do not neglect it.\n\nWritten with reverence by Sun Xueshi on the Mid-Autumn Day of the fifth year of the Qiandao era, the year *yichou*. ¹\n\n---\n¹ *Note in the original text: “This passage contains errors.”—Lu Ziye’s preface to the* Awakening to Reality.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the successive sages transmitted their teachings by first mastering technique to supplement the Way. Fu Xi, the Zhou, and Confucius all practiced the *Yi*’s technique. Hence it is said: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.” Confucius said: “Be prudent in this technique, and you shall never err.” The Buddha taught: “The Dharma is the Dharma—technique is the means.” Thus, the *Huayan Helun* states: “All skillful techniques enhance wisdom and compassion,” while the profound Way is called the technique of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. This is to say that the Yellow Emperor and Laozi both attained the Dao through this method. The Three Teachings are one family, truly without two Ways.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* of Tiantai and Master Ziyang, with its poems, lyrics, and songs, clearly reveals the technique of the Golden Elixir to fulfill the Way of enduring vision. Thus, the Master’s preface states: “The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, pitying humanity’s greed and attachment, employed the technique of cultivating life to follow their desires, gradually guiding them.” Ziye’s preface also says: “When a proper person practices an improper method, the improper method wholly reverts to correctness.” These all deeply grasp the essential meaning. In application, it is essence, qi, and spirit; in name, it is the Golden Elixir. Though its secrets are fully disclosed, the world has no one who understands. Moreover, the commentaries of Master Daoguang and Immortal Lu are exceedingly clear, yet people still fail to fathom the workings of yin and yang’s creative process—this is utterly inexcusable. External schools mistakenly label it as a side door, and some even slander it as the teachings of the Three Peaks’ sexual arts—how lamentable!\n\nThere are three reasons the Dao does not spread: First, those of superior roots and vessels, if they do not meet a true teacher, fall into emptiness and reckless abandon. Second, those of middling capacity, foolishly clinging to no teacher, wildly conjecture and guess. Third, the ignorant masses, drifting with the current, do not believe the Dao exists. Take Ye Wenshu, Yuan Gongfu, and their ilk—arbitrarily interpreting and annotating, citing immortal classics and ancient words to support their claims, yet failing to distinguish jade from stone—what benefit is there?\n\nWhen I first heard the teachings of Master Zhao, I dared not be complacent. Later, receiving the secret formula from the Old Immortal of Qingcheng, I understood the principle that yin and yang’s creative process, when followed, gives rise to humans, and when reversed, gives rise to immortals. No further debate was needed. As for the mysteries of the moon’s emergence, the birth of yang at geng, the subtleties of fire times, and the Qingcheng instructions—these are the most precise and easily practiced. Now, I dare not keep them secret. The few lines appended to each chapter of the *Wuzhen Pian* are the remaining insights of Xue and Lu, further elucidated to prevent later learners from entangling themselves in webs of doubt.\n\nAlas! Those in the world who believe in the Dao and practice it are rare indeed. The Way of the Golden Elixir has never been as intimate and urgent as in this *Wuzhen Pian*. Above, there are the direct transmissions of Pure Yang and Hai Chan; my own teachers, Chongyang and Danyang, and the words of the old immortals also align with this. Moreover, the successive transmissions of Xinglin, Daoguang, Niwan, and Ziqing all attained the immortal Dao through this. Though even a three-foot child knows the world possesses the technique of divine immortals, people of this age slander and revile it—how thoughtless they are!\n\nThe Old Man of Qingcheng transmitted to me the true formula and later instructed: “There will surely be kings and nobles who seek you as their teacher. The Dao cannot be hoarded in secrecy, nor can it be recklessly divulged. Who can discern this? I have a method of verification, quite reliable in revealing the truth. I now pass it to you—you may sift the sand to extract the gold.” Receiving my teacher’s transmission, I was as if startled in sleep and waking. First, I taught Marquis Tian. Later, Master Zhiyang traveled through Yelang, Kou Shui, Yuan Zhi, Chen Yang, Jingnan, the two E regions, Changsha, Lu Fu, and the lands east and west of the Jiang, teaching over a hundred people—all with the essential teaching of preserving the body through the Dao. As for the secret of extending life through technique, I could speak of it to barely two or three in a hundred. This is not my presumption—it is a matter of their capacity.\n\nI record this here to urge those who hear the Dao to each strive diligently. How wondrous! Though one may possess a pair of large jades to precede a team of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing in this Dao.\n\n**Purport to the *Wuzhen Pian* by Master Ziyang**\n\nThe utmost essential in learning immortality is this: even the world’s most foolish person, if they obtain the wondrous formula, may ascend to sagehood. Why? Because they firmly believe without doubt and act with courage. Learners who do not receive the true teacher’s oral transmission retreat in bewilderment. Otherwise, they wildly speculate, discoursing on nature, destiny, Chan, and the school—flaunting their dry wisdom. Who knows that this book contains an absolute verse:\n\n*Though you comprehend the true nature of Suchness,*\n*You must still cast off the body and re-enter the body.*\n*How much better to also cultivate the Great Medicine,*\n*And swiftly transcend to the untainted, becoming a true person!*\n\nThus, the Three Teachings, though their paths differ, all first comprehend nature and then cultivate life. There has never been one who knows how to cultivate life yet does not comprehend nature. For the Great Medicine enters through nature—only then is it the Golden Elixir. Those who know only nature—how can they grasp the wondrous workings of the Mysterious Female giving birth to the Elixir? Many in the world awaken to nature yet do not know how to cultivate life, hence the verse: “They are called the Four Fruits’ futile ones.” This clarifies that awakening to empty nature does not attain the supreme teaching of Bodhidharma. Later fools, however, claim that only after cultivating life does one seek to comprehend nature—how deceptive and deluded! What can be done?\n\nMoreover, in recent times, there are reckless people who falsely compose songs and eulogies, appending them to this book to blind the study of nature and life. Such works as the *Duzu Yingji* and *Ducantong Qi*, along with over forty Chan school songs, are filled with coarse and vulgar language—how can these illuminate nature? These are the doings of ignorant beginners, reciting them in unison like those on the same bed—such unfathomable words only deceive and confuse the world. I have now excised them all, lest they defile the profound text.\n\nThese people do not study Master Ziyang’s book, yet speak of fathoming the wondrous Dao, their words leaking the workings of transformation. Their intent is quite different, but their words are most urgent.",

      "translated_text": "As in the lines: *\"First take heaven and earth as the crucible and vessel, / Then gather the sun and moon as the elixir to refine.\"* Or again: *\"When lead meets gui, the two substances converge at the appointed time.\"* Such lofty and wondrous expressions—how could they be fathomed by those of base and defiled perception?\n\nThus the True Man’s own preface states: *\"Though the teachings divide into three, the Dao ultimately returns to one.\"* Yet how lamentable that later generations of the yellow-robed and black-clad, each clinging to their own sect, mutually denounce one another, causing the essential principles of the three schools to be lost in deviant byways, unable to merge and return to unity.\n\nIn my earlier years at the Ministry of Works, I harbored doubts on this matter, suspecting that immortality and Buddhism followed separate paths, and that nature and life were distinct pursuits. Later, by my teacher’s instruction, I was shown the way home and came to know that there is no principle of two Daos under heaven. Without the master’s guidance, all is but deceptive talk.\n\nHaving perused numerous texts and made exhaustive inquiries, I find that the *Wuzhen Pian* has garnered over thirty commentaries before and after. Among them, some have practiced diligently and gained deep insight; some have attained thorough understanding but not put it into action; some have entered the gate but lack the requisite \"fire-phase\"; some grasp the outline but know not where to begin; and some, without a true teacher, have presumptuously annotated the text, grossly misconstruing its intent. As the True Man said: *\"Scholars interpret according to their capacity, naturally forming the three vehicles’ distinctions.\"*\n\nNow, I have compiled the commentaries of Xue, Lu, and Chen, and had them printed for circulation. Their meanings converge, their purport is one—truly a ladder for later learners. As for the book’s origins, several accounts exist, each later exponent narrating their own version. The circumstances of its transmission are unreliable; some claim it was secretly bestowed by the Three Stars of the Wall, others that burning the author’s mortal remains yielded hundreds or thousands of śarīra—all fabrications, not to be credited.\n\nMen of discernment may judge these words for themselves. Follow them in practice, and both immortality and Buddhahood may be realized.\n\nWritten by Zhang Shihong, Minister of Works.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Wuzhen Pian***\n\nAlas! The human body is hard to obtain, yet time slips away with ease. Unaware of life’s brevity, how can one escape karmic retribution? Failing to awaken in time, one merely resigns to fate and awaits death. Should a single thought err at the final hour, one may fall into the three evil destinies, drifting for kalpas without hope of emergence. At such a moment, though one may repent, what use is it?\n\nThus the elders of Daoism and Buddhism opened the gate of expedient means through the study of nature and life, teaching people to cultivate the seed of liberation and escape the cycle of birth and death. Buddhism takes emptiness and quiescence as its essence; if one awakens suddenly and attains perfect penetration, one transcends directly to the other shore. Yet if residual habits remain, one still clings to existence. Daoism takes refinement and nurturance as truth; if one grasps its essential pivot, one ascends immediately to sagehood. Yet without clarity of original nature, one remains bound to the illusory form.\n\nNext, the *Book of Changes* contains phrases on exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining destiny; the *Analects of Lu* expounds the admonition to *\"have no preconceptions, no predeterminations, no obstinacy, no ego.\"* Here, Confucius plumbed the profound mysteries of nature and life. Yet why are his words often brief and lacking in detail? It is because his aim was to order human relationships and propagate the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and music. Thus, he did not openly speak of the Dao of non-action, but embedded its techniques within the images of the *Changes* and concealed its principles within subtle words.\n\nAs for Zhuangzi, who probed the fetters of things to reveal the nature of carefree wandering, and Mencius, who excelled in nurturing the flood-like qi—both came close to the mark. Later, Wei Boyang of the Han drew upon the *Changes* and the Dao of yin-yang’s union to compose the *Cantong Qi*, elucidating the workings of the Great Elixir. In the Tang, the Venerable Zhong of the Loyalty School prefaced his recorded sayings with the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi to illuminate the root and branches of the supreme Dao.\n\nIs this not proof that *\"though the teachings divide into three, the Dao ultimately returns to one\"*? Yet how lamentable that later generations of the yellow-robed and black-clad, each clinging to their own sect, mutually denounce one another, causing the essential principles of the three schools to be lost in deviant byways, unable to merge and return to unity.",

These are the doings of ignorant beginners, reciting them in unison like those on the same bed—such unfathomable words only deceive and confuse the world. I have now excised them all, lest they defile the profound text.\n\nThese people do not study Master Ziyang’s book, yet speak of fathoming the wondrous Dao, their words leaking the workings of transformation. Their intent is quite different, but their words are most urgent.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, people today believe that the Daoist tradition values the cultivation of life-destiny, yet they fail to recognize that the methods of cultivating life-destiny arise from two distinct paths: one is easily encountered but difficult to accomplish, while the other is difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish.\n\nFor instance, refining the qi of the Five Sprouts, absorbing the light of the Seven Luminaries, visualizing and massaging, inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid, reciting scriptures and mantras, sprinkling water and chanting talismans, clicking teeth to gather spirits, abandoning wives and fasting, concentrating the mind between the brows to replenish the brain and return essence, or practicing bedchamber arts—along with ingesting and refining minerals, metals, herbs, and plants—all belong to the category of methods that are easily encountered but difficult to accomplish. The above practices, though part of the path of self-cultivation, are largely fragmentary and flawed. Thus, despite great effort, no verifiable effects are attained. If one diligently applies oneself with unwavering resolve, day and night, these methods may at best ward off illness and prevent untimely misfortune. Yet should one cease practice, all prior efforts gradually dissipate. This merely prolongs the years without ensuring success. To hope for a single attainment that endures, to return to infancy and reverse aging, to transform and ascend in flight—is this not exceedingly difficult? Truly, it is a cause for deep sorrow.\n\nMost modern practitioners, deluded and attached, fail to awaken to the truth of the wondrous method and instead blame the immortals for deceit. Little do they know that those who attain the Dao all do so through the refinement of the Golden Elixir, yet fearing the revelation of celestial secrets, they veil their teachings under various pretexts. Among these methods, only breath-holding—if one can forget all scheming and still all thoughts—bears some resemblance to the seated meditation of the Two Vehicles. If practiced diligently, it may lead to samadhi and spirit departure. Yet since spirit belongs to yin and the bodily abode is hard to stabilize, one must perpetually employ shifting methods. Without grasping the Way of returning mercury and lead, how can one reverse yang, transform the bones, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight?\n\nThe refinement of the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, however, is difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish. It requires a thorough understanding of yin and yang and a deep mastery of creation’s workings. Only then can one pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the Primordial Palace, gather the Five Phases, harmonize the Four Images, where dragon chants and tiger roars, husband sings and wife follows, the jade crucible simmers, and the golden furnace blazes. Only then does the Mysterious Pearl take form, the Great One return to truth—all achieved in but a moment’s effort, securing boundless ease and joy forever.\n\nAs for guarding against danger and anticipating peril, one must be cautious in the application of withdrawal and addition. To nurture correctness and maintain fullness, one must embrace the feminine and hold to the One. Naturally, the qi of returning yang revives, the form of slaying yin is shed. When the cyclical nodes are complete, one sheds the mortal coil through spiritual transformation, one’s name is inscribed in the immortal register, and one is titled a Perfected Person—this is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is established.\n\nYet today’s scholars take lead and mercury as the two qi, point to the viscera as the Five Phases, divide heart and kidneys into Kan and Li, regard liver and lungs as dragon and tiger, use spirit and qi as mother and child, and cling to bodily fluids as lead and mercury. They fail to distinguish sinking from floating, much less discern host from guest. Is this not like mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own or calling a stranger one’s own child? How could they fathom the subtle interplay of metal and wood’s mutual restraint or the essential wonders of yin and yang’s reciprocal use? All this is like the sun and moon losing their path, lead and mercury placed in separate furnaces—how could they hope to congeal the Returning Elixir? Such aspirations are far indeed.\n\nFrom youth, I was devoted to the Dao and delved into the scriptures of the Three Teachings, extending my studies to law, calligraphy, mathematics, medicine, divination, military strategy, astronomy, geography, and the arts of fortune and fate—nothing escaped my careful inquiry. Yet of all these, only the method of the Golden Elixir remained elusive. Having perused all the classics and the songs, poems, and treatises of various schools, I found they spoke of the sun’s essence and the moon’s spirit, the metal tiger and the wood dragon, mercury and cinnabar, silver and tin, the Kan male and the Li female—all capable of forming the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir—but none revealed what true lead and true mercury are, nor explained the methods of fire timing, the degrees of warmth and nurturance, or the ultimate aim.\n\nMoreover, later generations of deluded followers, indulging their whims, have wantonly annotated the sacred teachings of the ancient sages, introducing myriad distortions. Not only do they confound the immortal scriptures, but they also mislead future learners. As I had not yet encountered a perfected being and the oral instructions were hard to come by, I became restless in sleep and meals, my spirit weary. Though I sought counsel across mountains and seas, inquiring of the wise and foolish alike, none could clarify the true essence or illuminate the depths of my heart.\n\nLater, in the year *jiyou* of the Xining era, while accompanying Minister Lu of the Dragon Diagram to Chengdu, my long-held resolve unwavering and my initial sincerity deepening, I was moved to receive from a Perfected One the oral instructions on the Golden Elixir’s ingredients and the fire timing’s secrets. His words were concise, his essentials uncluttered—truly, he pointed to the stream to reveal the source, spoke once to awaken a hundred. The mist dispersed, the sun shone bright, the dust settled, the mirror gleamed clear. Comparing his teachings to the immortal scriptures, they matched as if sealed together.\n\nReflecting that among ten or eight or nine of those who study immortality, scarcely one or two grasp the true essentials, I, having encountered the true key, dared not remain silent. I poured forth all I had received into ninety-nine regulated poems, titling them *Awakening to Reality*. Within are sixteen heptasyllabic quatrains to represent the number of two eights, sixty-four quatrains corresponding to the hexagrams of the *Zhou Changes*, and one pentasyllabic verse to symbolize the Great One. I later added twelve *Xijiangyue* lyrics to align with the twelve months of the year. All matters—such as the hierarchy of crucibles, the weight of ingredients, the advance and retreat of fire timing, the precedence of host and guest, the presence and absence of life and death, and the auspicious and inauspicious—are fully encompassed therein.\n\nAfter completing the collection, I realized it addressed only the arts of nurturing life-destiny and preserving form, while the original awakening of true nature remained unexplored. Thus, I turned to Buddhist scriptures and the *Transmission of the Lamp*, where I found that even the patriarchs had awakened upon hearing the strike of bamboo. This inspired me to compose thirty-two songs, odes, poems, and miscellaneous verses, which I now append to the end of the volume. Here, at last, the Way of realizing the root and illuminating nature is fully expounded.\n\nMay those of like aspiration who peruse this work perceive the branch and awaken to the root, abandon the false and follow the true.",

Yet even if one is called worthy, if one does not refine the wondrous Dao, one will merge with the common stream and vanish—such a one cannot be named a great man.\n\nA hundred years of glory pass like lightning; gold and jade piled high cannot avert impermanence. Consider the merit of Han Xin or the wealth of Shi Chong: the more they risked their lives to cast them away, the more they clung to fame and riches, only to destroy themselves. Thus the scripture says: *The true essence of the Dao can govern the body; its remnants may govern the state; its ultimate reaches may govern the world.*\n\nTherefore, to accumulate virtue is to be worthy; to accumulate wealth is to be foolish. Foolish and rich, one’s karma is heavy. Worthy and poor, one’s sins are light. Truly, the Way of Heaven repays in kind.\n\nThe Immortal Elder pitied the world’s fools who hoard wealth and amass property, so he composed this work, beginning with this poem to admonish and exhort people to revere and cultivate the supreme Dao:\n\n*Though man’s life may span a hundred years,*\n*Longevity or early death, poverty or success—none can foreknow.*\n*Yesterday he rode a horse through the streets;*\n*Today his corpse lies in a coffin.*\n*Wife and wealth, cast aside, are no longer his;*\n*The sins he carries will follow—no self-deceit avails.*\n*If one does not seek the Great Medicine, how can one chance upon it?*\n*To encounter it and not refine it is sheer folly.*\n\nDaoguang said: *Unicorns and phoenixes do not appear in every generation; immortals are not often seen. To empty the self of dreams, bubbles, and illusions, to escape the suffering of birth, aging, sickness, and death—this is a rarity among men.*\n\nWhen one meets a master on the Way and receives the master’s guidance, to begin cultivation swiftly is already too late. The Immortal Elder, in composing this poem, concluded with these words: *If one does not seek the Great Medicine, how can one chance upon it? To encounter it and not refine it is sheer folly.* His exhortation is so earnest—those of us who have not yet heard the Dao must seek a master at once. Those who have already met one—how can they sit in folly?\n\nOne should bind the millet of the moment, guard and embrace the empty immortal for nine years, conceal the heart in the Great Void, let the spirit roam the eight directions, reveal half a face amid purple clouds, and answer the immortal trial in the Dark Capital—lest Xu the Immortal alone be praised in the Jin dynasty.\n\nZiye said: *To know is not difficult; to practice is difficult indeed. How wondrous!*\nMaster Shangyang said: *The scripture says: Of men, the long-lived reach a hundred years, the middling eighty, the short-lived sixty. Subtracting days of sorrow, death, and mourning, barely four or five remain in a month. Yet people of this world all covet fame and profit, as if they could enjoy them forever, heedless of death’s approach.*\n\nI often sigh at the world’s fools, who beyond their own bodies are frantic for wives and children, devising a hundred schemes for wealth and honor. Yet once they die, their wives remarry, and their riches pass to new husbands—who would think of the former husband now suffering karmic retribution in hell? Thus the Immortal Elder said: *Wife and wealth, cast aside, are no longer his; the sins he carries will follow—no self-deceit avails.* His compassion is profound. He only wishes for people to cultivate the Dao and escape the wheel of rebirth.\n\nHow many proud and ambitious men, having met a true master who directly points to the Great Dao, still wait until their ambitions are fulfilled and their wishes satisfied before refining the Golden Elixir? Suddenly, Heaven does not grant them the years—what regret can then avail? Is this not folly?\n\nAlas! Those who have not heard must urgently seek a master. Those who have heard must immediately seek the medicine. Man’s longevity or early death cannot be foreknown—abandon attachments at once, cease folly, accept and practice with faith: such a one may be called wise.\n\nThough the study of immortality is the study of celestial immortals, only the Golden Elixir is most certain. When the two substances meet, nature and temperament unite; where the Five Agents are complete, tiger and dragon coil. Originally, *wu* and *ji* served as matchmakers, thus enabling the union of husband and wife in constant joy. Once the work is accomplished, one ascends the northern palace, riding a soaring simurgh amid the radiance of ninefold rosy clouds.\n\nDaoguang said: *Immortals have several ranks. Those whose yin spirits are most numinous yet formless are ghost immortals. Those who live in the world without illness and enjoy long life are human immortals. Those who fly through the air and walk through mist, who hunger not nor thirst, who are untouched by cold or heat, who roam the isles and live forever without dying are earth immortals. Those whose form and spirit are both wondrous, who merge with the true Dao, who walk without casting shadows in sun or moon, who enter metal and stone without hindrance, whose transformations are inexhaustible, whose appearances and vanishings are unfathomable, who may be old or young, who are most sagely and most divine—whom even ghosts and spirits cannot know, whom divination cannot fathom—are celestial immortals.*\n\nLord Yin the True said: *If one can sever desires, cultivate embryonic breathing, nurture the spirit into stillness, shed the husk and invest in a new womb, and transform through yin without decay, one may become a lower-grade ghost immortal. Those who receive the talismans of the Three Armors, the Orthodox Unity Alliance of Might, the wondrous methods of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity, or the arts of sword liberation and corpse release to attain the Dao are all ranked among the immortals of the Southern Palace. Those who cultivate the truth in the various grottoes and attain the Dao are middle-grade immortals. Those who refine the Golden Elixir and complete the Great Medicine, whether by shedding the husk or ascending in broad daylight, are the supreme immortals of the Nine Ultimates.*",

      "translated_text": "The seventy-two grades of elixir methods all aim at attaining the Dao of Heavenly Immortals, yet only the Golden Elixir is the supreme Way. This is the art of generating something from nothing—refining the primordial True One’s qi before Heaven and Earth were separated. It is not the later-born five metals, eight minerals, cinnabar, mercury, black lead, white tin, yellow dan, realgar, orpiment, sulfur, arsenic powder, autumn stone, plant ash, frost, snow, or ice dregs, nor the substances generated from something within the body’s fluids, essence, qi, blood, or secretions. Only the True One’s qi, which the sage captures and condenses within a single double-hour into a single grain like a millet seed, is called the Golden Elixir, also known as True Lead, Yang Elixir, the essence of the True One, the water of the True One, Water Tiger, or the Taiyi-Containing-True-Qi. Whoever ingests it ascends immediately to the sacred rank—this is the wondrous Way of the supreme Nine Ultimates’ highest-grade Heavenly Immortals, rarely encountered by mortals.\n\nYou five companions have now attained the Great Dao. Sever fleeting thoughts, concentrate your spirit in the Azure Vault, and do not pursue middle or lower paths. Strive instead to realize the position of the supreme Nine Ultimates’ highest-grade Heavenly Immortal.\n\nThe True One’s qi existed before Heaven and Earth, blending within the formless void—dim and indistinct, invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, intangible to grasp. How then can it be condensed into a millet-seed pearl? The sage shapes the real through the formless, manifests the existent through the nonexistent. The real and existent are True Yin and True Yang, beings of the same kind and mutual affinity. The formless and nonexistent are the qi of the waxing and waning crescents—present as qi yet lacking substance. When these two take form, one thing is born. That \"one\" is the True One’s qi condensed into a millet-seed pearl. As the scripture says: *The Primordial Beginning suspended a precious pearl, large as a millet seed, within the Empty Mystery*—this is its proof.\n\nFearing the leakage of celestial secrets, the sages used True Yin and True Yang as metaphors for the Green Dragon and White Tiger, and the qi of the two crescents as metaphors for True Lead and True Mercury. In the immortal elders’ poetic verses, the Dragon is further named the Crimson Dragon, Thunder Dragon, Celestial Soul, Qian House, Qian Crucible, Jade Tripod, Jade Furnace, Fusang, Lower Crescent, Eastern Yang, Eldest Son, Cinnabar Mercury, Quicksilver, Cinnabar, Li Sun, Crimson Phoenix—all metaphors for the Green Dragon. The Tiger is named the Black Tiger, Dui Tiger, Earthly Soul, Kun Position, Kun Tripod, Metal Furnace, Metal Tripod, Mount Hua, Upper Crescent, Western River, Youngest Daughter, Black Lead, Crescent Moon Furnace, Kan Moon, Black Tortoise—all metaphors for the White Tiger.\n\nThe Dragon’s crescent qi is called True Mercury, the Alchemical Maiden, Wood Sap, Green Maiden, Mercury Enveloped in Vermilion, Nature, White Snow, Flowing Pearl, Green-Clad Maiden, Golden Crow, Li Maiden, Qian Dragon, True Fire, the Sixteen-Year-Old Alchemical Maiden, Jade Mushroom—all one and the same. The Tiger’s crescent qi is called True Lead, Metal Elder, Metal Essence, Gold in Water, Silver in Water, Sentiment, Yellow Sprout, Golden Flower, White-Clad Gentleman, Jade Hare, Kan Son, Male Tiger, True Water, Nine-Three Gentleman, Knife-Tip Powder—all one and the same.\n\nWhen these two beings meet and sentiment and nature unite, the two become Dragon and Tiger. The Green Dragon in the East belongs to Wood, which generates Fire. The Dragon’s crescent qi is Fire, called Nature, belonging to the South—termed the Vermilion Bird. The White Tiger in the West belongs to Metal, which generates Water. The Tiger’s crescent qi is Water, called Sentiment, belonging to the North—termed the Dark Warrior. When Wood, Fire, Metal, and Water unite, Dragon and Tiger’s sentiment and nature communicate, the Four Symbols converge at the Center, and the work returns to Wuji Earth. Earth is the Elixir. This is called the perfection of the true Five Phases.\n\nWuji serves as the matchmaker: Wood in the East and Metal in the West, their sentiments separated—who will act as matchmaker? Only the Yellow Dame can unite them, leading the Dragon to the Tiger as husband and wife. Wuji belongs to Earth, called the Yellow Dame. Though Dragon and Tiger dwell in East and West, the Yellow Dame enables their joyful union. Though Metal and Wood are divided, the Yellow Dame brings their fusion. These two conceal the True One’s qi; when the two are one, the True One’s qi transforms, and the True Person naturally emerges—this is the external medicine’s symbolic method.\n\nWhen the Elixir ripens in the human realm, merit is accomplished in Heaven, enveloped in ninefold rosy clouds, with winds rising beneath both armpits. Without planting the spiritual root through vast cultivation of hidden virtue, who could speak of this?\n\nZiye said: *Without the Golden Elixir, one cannot attain the Dao of Heavenly Immortals. Yet what is this Golden Elixir?* Ah! Clearly it is originally my own substance, entrusted to the Kun Palace—Kun is the human. What are these two things? Myself and the other. When self and other meet, sentiment and nature harmonize, and the Five Phases are complete. Dragon and Tiger are merely sentiment and nature. Yet how does this \"meeting\" occur? Within active use, there is no merit; within merit, active use is applied. Ah! *Dense bamboo does not hinder flowing water; high mountains do not obstruct drifting clouds.*\n\nWuji is the Center, the position of correctness. Wuji is the Earth of intent. When the intents of self and other unite, the joy of husband and wife is attained. If Yin’s intent seeks Yang while Yang’s intent does not seek Yin, Yin and Yang clash without interpenetration, and no thing is born.",

For the Way of the heavenly immortal, apart from the Golden Elixir, there exists no other method. The Golden Elixir is the primordial qi of Yin and Yang, the antecedent of the Supreme Ultimate, the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhat are these \"two things\"?

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said that when the two substances meet, it is the union of one emotion and one nature, the joyous meeting of one Qian and one Kun, the reunion of one Yin and one Yang. Only through meeting can there be union. Wu and Ji serve as the matchmakers—*mei* is that which conveys the messages between the two families, while *pin* is that which transmits the momentary passage. Yet there is both an inner and an outer: externally, as the Muddy Pellet Elder said, \"Without shared speech, it is not a matter of spring affinity.\" Internally, Wu and Ji are the gateways of Qian and Kun, the coming and going of Yin and Yang, the rising and falling of Dragon and Tiger, the matchmakers of male and female. For lead lies in the west and mercury in the east, separated by a thousand miles—were it not for Wu and Zi acting as mutual matchmakers to bring them together, how could the true qi of the One be produced?\n\nThis \"husband and wife\" are not the husband and wife of the mundane world. The couples of the world rejoice in bearing sons and daughters, delight in the depletion of their essence and spirit. From this arise affection and attachment, from this arise birth, aging, illness, and death, suffering that binds and entangles. Thus the scripture says: parents are taken for their kindness, wives and concubines for their love, children for their form—all are constrained by the realm of desire and love, unable to sever themselves from the domain of wealth and honor. Only the sage can act according to the times, neither grasping nor rejecting. To bear children in one’s prime is to continue the moral order; yet by forty, to remain unconfused and unmoved in heart is not to be controlled by love and procreation.\n\nThe \"husband and wife\" of the Golden Elixir are uniquely wondrous. There are also inner and outer aspects, with several explanations: for the Tiger to wed the Dragon is outer; for Kan to be matched with Li is outer; for the Zhen male to seek the Dui female is outer. As for lead uniting with mercury, that is inner; qi uniting with spirit, that is inner; the merging of being into non-being, that is inner. All these are likened to the union of male and female, yet they transform suffering into joy, leaving no trace of affection or attachment, and regard severance and relinquishment as paramount. Their intercourse lasts but half an hour, and they obtain the pearl the size of a millet grain—thus they become neither of the myriad things nor of humankind, but through reverse cultivation attain immortality and Buddhahood. These are the \"husband and wife\" of the Golden Elixir.\n\nThough every household possesses this, it is not one’s own to use, for what is seen cannot be employed. Should one seek it, the essential method and resources must be found within the divine continent of the Red County, for its use is not something visible. To refine this Golden Elixir, one must first cultivate the self in preparation for the moment when Yang arises. Without the work of self-cultivation, even if the two substances meet, the matchmakers unite, and the husband and wife are true, one will see lead arrive only for mercury to fail to respond.\n\nThus the ancient immortals and sagely masters first refined this Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor before ascending in broad daylight. Examples include the Yellow Emperor at Lake Dinghu, and the ascensions of Zhang, Ge, and Xu. These are but the few known to the world—how much more remains unsaid! And how much more remains unknown!",

      "translated_text": "Thus the tradition states: roughly thirty thousand adorned persons have ascended in flight, and over eight hundred households have been lifted whole. All these attained immortality through the Dao of the Golden Elixir, having accumulated merit and layered practice—how could they fail to soar on phoenixes and pay court at the Northern Palace?\n\nThis method is true within the true, most wondrous—all verdant while I alone differ from others.\nI know reversal comes from *li* and *kan*,\nbut who discerns the floating and sinking to fix host and guest?\nIf the golden crucible retains cinnabar-wrapped mercury,\nthe jade pool first receives silver from water.\nThe divine work of firing does not last the whole dawn—\na single wheel of moon emerges from the deep pool.\n\nDao Guang says: This Dao is most numinous, most sagely, most honored, most noble, most simple, most easy—profound beyond profundity, wondrous within the wondrous, rarely heard of in the world. The immortal elders stand apart from their kind, transmitting its deep purport alone.\n\nMaster Wang Chongzhao of the Real says: Of all the Daoists in the world, none grasp the Dao of the Golden Elixir—only Ping Shu did so over time, and none other. How could one dare compare the anthills of Mount Tai or the flowing torrents of rivers and seas?\n\n*Li* is Yang and dwells in the south, yet it is reversed to become female—externally Yang but internally Yin, this is called true mercury.\n*Kan* is Yin and dwells in the north, yet it is reversed to become male—externally Yin but internally Yang, this is called true lead.\nThe later poem says:\nThe sun abides in *li*’s position yet turns female,\n*Kan* matches the toad palace yet becomes male.\nThis speaks of *kan* as male and *li* as female, like the father’s essence and the mother’s blood, the sun’s crow and the moon’s hare, mercury in cinnabar and silver in lead, the dark of heaven and the yellow of earth. All these refer to the initial arc of Dragon and Tiger qi.\n\nReversal of host and guest: Yang is noble and high, dwelling on the left—this is the host. Yin is humble and low, dwelling on the right—this is the guest. *Li* is fire, fire flames upward, and the nature of fire and wood both float—this is the host. *Kan* is water, water flows downward, and the nature of water and metal both sink—this is the guest. This is the ordinary Dao.\n\nNow, *li* is reversed to become female, and *kan* is reversed to become male—thus the host becomes the guest, and the guest becomes the host. Moreover, in the Dao, one takes the reversed meaning of the two arcs to determine host and guest, not the ordinary host and guest.\n\nThe golden crucible: gold is a Yin substance, yet within the crucible lies the most Yang qi—this is the image of Yin containing Yang, the White Tiger. The jade pool: jade is a Yang substance, yet within the pool lies the most Yin qi—this is the image of Yang containing Yin, the Azure Dragon. Mercury in cinnabar is the arc qi of the Dragon; silver in water is the arc qi of the Tiger.\n\nIf the cultivator of the Elixir wishes to retain the Tiger with the Dragon, they must first drive the Tiger to the Dragon. Then the two qi intermingle, the two natures unite, and through the work of firing and refinement, the true One’s essence naturally congeals.\n\nFiring refers to the qi of the two arcs. Dawn is the beginning of the day, the origin of the six Yang—hence it is called *dan*. The sage moves the elixir fire with divine and wondrous power, and in less than half an hour, obtains a single grain of the true One’s essence, large as a millet seed, appearing in the Northern Sea—its light piercing through curtains, like a brilliant sun wheel emerging from the deep pool.\n\n\"Not lasting the whole dawn\" means that within a single hour, the Golden Elixir is instantly accomplished. This is the outer medicine’s symbolic form.",

      "translated_text": "Ziye said: I originate from *li* yet revert to *yin*; that one originates from *kan* yet reverts to *yang*. Above and below reverse their proper order—hence it is called \"inversion.\" That lead sinks, and sinking means descent. My mercury floats, and floating means ascent. Using mercury to restrain lead, that one becomes the host while I become the guest. *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: \"The lead Dragon ascends, the mercury Tiger descends—subtle, oh so subtle!\" The Classic says: \"The mouth is the Jade Pool of Grand Harmony Palace.\" The Golden Crucible represents me; the Jade Pool represents that one. Retaining the mercury within my body, I secure the silver of the Jade Pool’s return, restraining it so it does not flee. Silver is lead.\n\nFire arises when the qi of *yin* and *yang* unite and move inward; inward movement generates warmth and harmony, enabling it to fuse the true essence of things and cause their union. If the qi of *yin* and *yang* do not unite, it is not fire. Today’s scholars mistake uninterrupted breathing for \"moving fire\"—how erroneous! They do not realize that uninterrupted breathing is the *yin* tally. Why? The number two pertains to fire, while one pertains to water; combined, they form two, but uncombined, they remain one. The marvel lies in the moment when, beneath accumulated *yin*, the solitary *yang* returns. Thus, fire must be applied in accordance with the proper timing—this principle is clear. If scholars grasp its subtlety and apply it, the *yang* qi will return to the Cinnabar Field, radiating brilliance like the sun over a deep pool—how wondrous its effect!\n\nShangyangzi said: \"The word 'subtle'—who would believe it?\" Those who differ from others are those who, while the world is deluded by love and desire, discern within love and desire. What is this discernment? The sage employs *li* and *kan* in inversion, calling it \"water above, fire below.\" Employing *qian* and *kun* in inversion, it is called \"earth above, heaven below.\" Employing husband and wife in inversion, it is called \"man below, woman above.\" Floating and sinking: fire and wood rise and dominate above as host, while water and metal descend and submit below as guest. This is the human Dao, the worldly method, the natural sequence of the Five Phases.\n\nNow, though fire and wood naturally float, we cause them to descend and become guest. Though metal and water naturally sink, we cause them to ascend and become host. This is the immortal Dao, the supramundane method, the mutual completion of water and fire, the inversion of the Five Phases. The Golden Crucible and Jade Pool, where the Dao’s light converges, do not depart from the mechanism of inversion—yet one must not lose the meaning of \"desiring to retain\" and \"prior descent.\" Ziye’s analogy of the Golden Crucible as me and the Jade Pool as that one aligns with Master Ziyang’s intent. Why? Because what preserves one’s own essence, qi, blood, and fluids is cinnabar-coated mercury—it must not be allowed to escape, hence \"desiring to retain.\" As for that one’s Flower Pool divine fluid and Elixir Well sweet spring, they are silver within water, the primordial single point of true qi—hence \"prior descent.\"\n\n\"Desiring to retain\" means merely keeping it present without letting it depart, seeking it from the other while not losing it oneself. \"Prior descent\" means awaiting its arrival while I prepare, mercury welcoming lead, *kan* moving while *li* receives. The Dao of the Golden Elixir first requires clarity on these four characters: \"desiring to retain\" and \"prior descent.\" \"Fire is not applied for the whole dawn\" means fire must be moved with gentle warmth. Thus, *The Kinship of the Three* states: \"At the outset of firing, warmth is subtle, like the stirring of a hexagram line.\" The Venerable Pure Yang said: \"In the deep of night, the clepsydra’s flow is warm; the lead crucible’s light pierces the curtains.\" For at the inception of all things’ transformation, they receive the qi of *yin* and *yang* in but a fleeting moment. How much more so with this Dao of supreme immortality, which refines the primordial qi—its speed is even swifter! Thus the Buddha said, \"Like dew, like lightning,\" referring to its utmost purity and subtlety, its rapid efficacy, for it cannot endure long—prolonged, it incurs loss and deficiency.\n\nIf this primordial true lead is returned to the Suspended Womb Chamber, is this not like the red sun appearing over a deep pool? \"The Tiger leaps, the Dragon soars—waves surge roughly; at the central true position, the Mysterious Pearl is born. Though fruit on the branch will ripen in time, how is the child in the womb different? South and North trace their origins in hexagram images; dawn and dusk’s firing accords with the celestial pivot. Know that the great hermit dwells in the marketplace—why seek solitude in the deep mountains?\"\n\nDaoguang said: This speaks of the inner medicine’s symbolic form. The true One’s essence, though its transformation occurs externally, is called the Golden Elixir, or true earth. When swallowed into the abdomen, it is named true lead, or yang elixir. Here, the Tiger is the Golden Elixir. The Dragon is my true qi. The wind and waves are my true qi surging forth from the Sea of Qi, billowing like waves, stirring like wind. The central true position is the Golden Womb’s divine chamber within the Cinnabar Field, the place where the elixir congeals and qi coalesces. The Mysterious Pearl is the infant, also called the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir.\n\nThe Golden Elixir, formed from the union of the primordial single qi, is the mother, the sovereign, the lead—hence it is called the Tiger. My true qi, born of the posterior heaven, is the child, the minister, the mercury—hence it is called the Dragon. The Golden Elixir comes from without; when swallowed into the abdomen, my true qi wells up from the lower Sea of Qi like wind and waves, serving it as a minister serves a sovereign, as a child serves a mother—their mutual intent is evident. Dragon and Tiger unite within the divine chamber, forming the sacred embryo, like fruit ripening on the branch, like a child destined to be born in the womb. After ten months of work, the embryo naturally detaches, and spiritual transformation knows no bounds.\n\nSouth and North are *zi* and *wu*.

      "translated_text": "Dawn and dusk mark the beginnings of day and night. The *zi* hour stands as the first of the six yang hours, hence it is dawn. The *wu* hour stands as the first of the six yin hours, hence it is dusk. At dawn, the *Zhun* hexagram governs affairs, the proper time for advancing fire. At dusk, the *Meng* hexagram governs affairs, the proper time for advancing water. One day encompasses two hexagrams, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng*, and concluding with *Jiji* and *Weiji*. Cycling endlessly in repetition, this is called \"revolving the hexagrams.\" As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"At the new moon’s dawn, *Zhun* governs; by evening, *Meng* takes its turn. Day and night each hold one hexagram, applied in due sequence. From *Jiwei* to the end of the month, the cycle concludes and begins anew.\"\n\nOne day sees two hexagrams governing affairs; one month accounts for sixty hexagrams. Each hexagram has six lines, and including the four *yin-yang* hexagrams, totals three hundred eighty-four lines, corresponding to the intercalary days of a year. The first nine of *Qian* arises from the first six of *Kun*. *Qian*’s tally is thirty-six, its lines numbering two hundred sixteen. The first six of *Kun* arises from the first nine of *Qian*. *Kun*’s tally is twenty-four, its six lines numbering one hundred forty-four. Together they sum to three hundred sixty, matching the celestial cycle.\n\nThe movements of the sun and moon—conjunction and ascent, descent—never exceed the bounds of the hexagrams and lines. The moon moves swiftly, completing one celestial cycle in a month. The sun moves slowly, completing one cycle in a year. The Celestial Pivot is the Northern Dipper; it completes one revolution each day and night, shifting its position once each month. Thus, in the first month it aligns with *yin*, in the second with *mao*, and so forth. Hence it is said: \"Each month it invariably advances to *xu*, at every hour revealing the Breaking Army.\"\n\nThe perfected and realized ones know the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, comprehend the ascent and descent of yin and yang, and practice the *zi-wu* fire signs. The sun governs day, the moon governs night; adjusting in accord with the seasons, they subtly align with celestial measures—thus it is called \"harmonizing with the Celestial Pivot.\" The supreme Dao, the most wondrous, lies precisely here.\n\nThe ascent and descent of *Kan* and *Li* generate the numinous medicine, first congealing the Yellow Sprout. The great medicine of the Golden Elixir is possessed by every household, unbound by marketplace or court. Yet how many recognize the Dragon when they see it, or the Tiger? Few indeed are those who cultivate it in reverse.\n\nIn the span of a single moment, a pearl forms, as large as a grain of millet. One must not gaze upon it in the palm, nor speak of it once swallowed into the abdomen. Master Ziye said: \"The rough winds and waves are the imagery of the two qi in mutual arousal. After their arousal, the winds subside and the waves calm.

      "translated_text": "At the moment of gathering the medicine, firmly grasp the single thought—internally observe the heart, yet the heart is no-heart; externally observe the form, yet the form is no-form; distantly observe things, yet things are no-things. By directing intention to meet it, the Mysterious Pearl is born within the cinnabar field.\n\nAs for the inverted hexagrams: Kan above and Li below form \"Water and Fire in Mutual Aid\"; Qian below and Kun above form \"Heaven and Earth in Peace\"; Dui above and Zhen below form \"Lake and Thunder Following\"; Gen below and Dui above form \"Lake and Mountain in Harmony.\" The Celestial Pivot is the Dipper’s handle. The Dao of the Golden Elixir lies wondrously in celestial resonance. The pivot of the Dipper stands as the human pole—serene and unmoving, yet responsive and instantly penetrating. This is what the Buddhists call *vajra*. Those who embody this early seek the Elixir. This Elixir exists within humankind and is sought amidst the marketplace. The so-called Divine Continent of the Red Earth is where the Great Medicine is produced—it is not found in deep mountains or vast marshes, nor is it hidden in famous grottoes. Why? Mountains are high and thus yang is scarce; marshes are remote and thus yin is solitary.\n\nThere are fools who, upon hearing of cultivation, immediately speak of sitting motionless in deep mountains or dwelling alone in desolate valleys. Alas! Do they know what Bodhidharma or Mazu truly meant? Mazu, before refining the Great Medicine, sat in dry meditation seeking the Buddha—hence the mockery of \"grinding bricks.\" Bodhidharma, having entered the chamber at Changlu, practiced in the cold seclusion of Shaolin. Cultivation and practice each have their time. Thus, my master said: \"Sitting in stillness is a matter for *after* obtaining the Elixir.\" If one cannot achieve great concealment amidst the marketplace, why insist on solitude in the mountains?\n\nWhenever I speak of this, I cannot help but sigh deeply. Roughly speaking, this chapter reveals that Daoist radiance has already attained the External Elixir, yet it merely illustrates the symbolic forms of the Internal Medicine. Hence it says: \"The Golden Elixir comes from outside the self; when swallowed into the belly, one knows the true qi surges from the lower Sea of Qi, like winds and waves rising in tumult.\" Yet Ziye says, \"The wind is calm, the waves are still,\" which seems contradictory. The Immortal Masters each express their views, all urging disciples to ponder carefully, discern clearly, refine diligently, and practice assiduously.\n\nWhen tending the furnace, visions naturally appear. Once the true unity of lead is obtained and returned to the spirit-chamber, one must only guard with reticence. Like fruit on the branch waiting for the season to ripen, or a child in the womb waiting for qi to complete, when the time is ripe and qi is full, transformation occurs naturally.\n\nEvery person possesses the medicine of longevity—it is only the deluded who foolishly cast it aside. When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite; where the yellow sprout grows, Kan and Li converge. The well-frog claims there is no dragon’s cave; the hedge-sparrow disputes the phoenix’s nest. When the Elixir ripens, gold fills the house—why seek herbs to burn thatch?\n\nDaoguang says: \"Sweet dew and yellow sprout are alternate names for the Golden Elixir. Heaven and earth, Kan and Li, are the symbolic forms of dragon and tiger. When the qi of heaven and earth intermingle, sweet dew descends naturally. When the qi of Kan and Li unite, the yellow sprout grows naturally. When the qi of the dragon and tiger’s two strings copulate, the Golden Elixir forms naturally. This supreme treasure exists in every household, yet because it is too near, it is lightly discarded. Little do they know it is the cloud-ladder to ascension.\n\nModern scholars often cling to heterodox methods—solitary yin, orphaned yang, existence arising from existence, easily encountered but difficult to complete—and apply them to the body. They do not realize this Dao is simple and easily accomplished, like the frog in the well or the sparrow in the hedge, unaware of the phoenix’s nest or the dragon’s cave. Once the pearl of millet is hung, the intention of heaven and earth can be grasped. As the scripture says: \"When the earth’s treasury is opened, gold and jade reveal their forms.\" This is the proof. Why seek herbs and burn thatch year after year?\n\nAlas, I am old—whose fault is this?\n\nZiye says: \"What is the thing called longevity? Hm! Children and grandchildren, following what goes and reversing what comes—who knows the eternal sigh? Yellow sprout and sweet dew are both names for medicine; heaven and earth, Kan and Li, are in truth the human being. When heaven and earth unite, when Kan and Li converge, the medicine is born. Fools and ignorant ones do not know this Dao, resigned to awaiting their end. The frog and sparrow know not the phoenix’s nest or the dragon’s cave.\"\n\nShangyangzi says: \"The previous three poems have already exhausted the wonders of the Returned Elixir. This chapter further expounds the essential meaning of sweet dew’s descent. The Dao of the Golden Elixir exists in every person, in every household. The foolish are deluded and unaware; mediocre people may occasionally hear of it but do not believe, instead slandering it. The *Yi*’s *Peace* hexagram says: 'Heaven and earth unite—peace.' It also says: 'Heaven and earth unite, and the myriad things communicate; above and below unite, and their aspirations are the same.' When a single yang qi ascends and a single yin qi descends, sweet dew falls. If true water moistens above and true fire blazes below, the yellow sprout forms. Know that sweet dew and yellow sprout are the primordial unity of qi. When this qi arrives, the Elixir forms immediately. Yet if above and below do not unite, their aspirations differ; if heaven and earth do not harmonize, this qi does not descend; if yin and yang are not of the same kind, the yellow sprout is not produced.\n\nThe Immortal Elder explicitly speaks of sweet dew’s descent to make people understand the principle of heaven and earth in peace. When Kan and Li unite, one knows the Dao of water and fire in mutual aid. Alas! The world’s people have narrow experience, like well-frogs and hedge-sparrows—how can they have far-reaching vision? How can they know the Mysterious Female’s gate, from which sweet dew descends and the yellow sprout grows? How can they witness the dragon’s cave and phoenix’s nest as auspicious signs? Instead, they cling to what is before their eyes—seeking herbs, burning thatch—how laughable!\"",
      "overlap_context": "ne must neither overdo nor neglect. Internally, after the elixir has formed, its nurturance must not falter.\n\nThe Immortal Elder compares a single grain of true yang to the tiger, for the tiger is the most difficult creature to control. Thus, the *Xici* of the *Yi* states: \"Treading on a tiger’s tail, it bites a man—ominous.\" This means that if one treads without following the Way, the tiger will bite. It is like being amidst a raging storm and towering waves, ever fearful of capsizing and ruin.",

      "translated_text": "Have you not heard what Pure Yang Elder said? The Ninth River’s Prefect Zhang consumed elixirs and lost his sight, his spirit and qi withered—he knew not that the Reverted Elixir has no substance, yet he recklessly ingested metals and minerals. How foolish indeed! Listen carefully to these words—can you not be cautious?\n\nPeople are born endowed with heaven and earth’s purest qi, and thus all may comprehend the sages’ Way. Yet why do distinctions of worthiness, foolishness, poverty, and lowliness arise? How much worse when blind masters lead them into side doors!\n\nKnow this: the place where medicine is produced, the source of the river, lies only in the southwest—this is its native land. When lead meets the birth of *gui*, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the distant full moon, it is no longer fit to taste. Send it back to the earthen crucible, seal it tightly, then join it with flowing pearls for pairing. The medicine weighs one *jin*, requiring two eights; regulate the fire’s timing, entrusting it to yin and yang.\n\nThe *Daoist Radiance* states: \"The medicine is in the southwest, gathered in *wu-ji*. Harvest it at the proper time, and the day for effort arrives.\" The southwest is the *kun* direction, the land of the White Tiger. It is also the place where the moon is born each month—hence called its native land. The moon is the essence of metal and water; at the two crescents, metal and water’s qi unite to give birth. Thus, the medicine’s source and the river’s origin for the Golden Elixir truly emerge from the *kun* earth.\n\n\"Lead sees *gui* born\" refers to the approach of the *chou* hour. \"Gold meets the distant full moon\" means the moon is waning. The moon’s waxing and waning depend on oral instructions; the timing of *zi* and *wu* lies in heart-to-heart transmission. The breath of the celestial cycle is a subtle count, each moment aligned with the jade clepsydra’s chilling tones. This is the true esoteric teaching passed mouth to mouth.\n\nYet how do side doors proliferate—mistaking cinnabar for lead, using *tian-gui* to extract it, no different from child’s play! Ye Wenshu’s phrase \"kun receives *gui*\" is equally laughable. Lu Sicheng’s preface says: \"This poem’s transmission is rife with errors—taking *lead* as *if*, *gold* as *like*—greatly distorting the Immortal Elder’s intent.\" Little do they know that lead and gold *are* the Golden Elixir. All this stems from never meeting a true master, recklessly forcing interpretations.\n\nMaster Lu exposed the error, correcting the misreadings of *Yufu* and *Qilü*. He concealed the source, fearing its spread in written records. We have received the mysterious teaching firsthand and should understand it ourselves. If not, within the void’s emptiness, five *zhang* above the earth, the pearl of millet is not easily obtained.\n\nWhen ingesting the elixir, return it to the Yellow Court’s earthen crucible—it must be firmly sealed so the embryo does not leak. Circulate the fire, flying the flowing pearl of mercury to pair with it, and the sacred embryo will form. Raven’s liver, eight *liang*; hare’s marrow, half a *jin*—two eights, eight *liang*, combining into one *jin*—hence \"the medicine weighs one *jin*, requiring two eights.\" The fire is not truly fire; it relies on yin and yang’s qi to regulate and move it.\n\nZiye said:\n\"The medicine emerges in the southwest, the *kun* position—\nTo seek the *kun* position, how could it leave the person?\nI speak plainly for you to remember—\nOnly fear that when you meet it, you may not recognize it as real.\"\n\n*Gui* is the medicine. When the medicine is about to be born, hasten to gather it—only then is it usable. If delayed, the medicine will have already taken form; once form arises, it becomes a post-heaven substance, and as the saying goes, \"what is seen cannot be used.\" At this time, the water’s source is utterly pure, possessing qi but no form—lasting only one hour in a day. The *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: \"In a day’s twelve hours, wherever the mind arrives, all may be the proper time.\"\n\n\"Gold meets the distant full moon\" is a metaphor for missing the time to gather the medicine—its qi has passed, like the moon after the full, waning day by day, called \"no longer fit to taste.\" The mirror was originally bright, but dust obscured it and dimmed it. The lead pearl alone gleams because *gui* accumulates and gradually hides it. When dust is removed, the mirror’s body remains; when *gui* is exhausted, lead’s brilliance reappears. Lead must be swiftly gathered, lest *gui* water gradually arise later. Gold is the same—borrowing the mirror’s dust-obscured state as a metaphor.\n\nHaving gathered the medicine born of *gui*, place it in the cinnabar field, then firmly seal it to prevent leakage and the escape of numinous medicine. Next, circulate one’s own yin mercury to pair and unite with it, forming the sacred embryo. The sealing method, as the *Triple Concordance* says: \"The *li* qi receives the constructive and defensive; *kan* then does not lose its hearing. *Dui* joins without speech—silence accords with the vast primeval chaos.\" It also says: \"Mercury itself becomes flowing pearls; when yin and yang balance, the sacred embryo forms.\" If one side is deficient, even a hair’s difference will fail to produce the elixir.\n\nOnce the sacred embryo is formed, without regulating the fire’s timing, how can one hope for completion? Master Shangyang said: The *Book of Changes* states, \"In the southwest, one obtains companions and walks with one’s kind.\" The southwest is the *kun* direction, land of like kind—where lead is produced and medicine is born. *Dui* replaces *kun* to embrace yang and form *kan*; *dui*’s initial *gui* is true yin and true yang. The first movement is called *gui* giving birth to heaven and earth. After seven days, it returns—*fu* is *zi*. The Greater Yin emerges after three days—*geng* is metal. In the human body, after three days, one observes the meridian—*jing* is lead. After *gui* moves, lead is born; lead’s initial birth is called the qi of primordial true unity. This qi is named *Golden Flower*.\n\nSpeaking of lead and *gui* without mentioning water emphasizes its qi. Lead is born after *gui*; yang is produced within lead. Gathering true lead, borrowing the term \"refining the elixir,\" the work takes only half an hour—this aligns with the great transformation. Thus, in a month, there is only one day; in a day, only one hour. This hour is most difficult to obtain, for it is when heaven and earth unite their virtue, sun and moon unite their brightness—the true mechanism of generation and transformation. Reversing and cultivating it, one transcends the ordinary and enters sagehood. Thus, the Immortal Elder most urgently emphasizes swiftly gathering when *gui* is born.\n\nSending it back to the earthen crucible, pairing it with flowing pearls, regulating the fire’s timing—this completes the sacred embryo. I now reveal heaven and earth’s mechanism to clarify the Immortal Elder’s earnest intent.",

      "translated_text": "The superior scholar who awakens to this truth should diligently practice without doubt. The subtle and meticulous principles of harmonization lie in one’s wholehearted effort and devoted practice, delving deeply into its wondrous transformations. Laozi said: *\"Subtle, mysterious, and profoundly penetrating—this is the mark of the superior scholar.\"*\n\nAbandon the refining of the Three Yellows and Four Spirits; seeking myriad medicines is not the true path. When yin and yang of the same kind unite in mutual resonance, when the two eights correspond, they naturally bond in affinity. At the pond’s depths, the sun glows red and yin’s aberrations vanish; on the mountain’s peak, the moon shines white and the medicinal sprout renews.\n\nPeople of this age must recognize true lead and mercury—they are not common cinnabar or quicksilver. Daoguang said: *\"The Three Yellows, Four Spirits, metals, stones, herbs, and trees are all post-celestial, turbid substances of earthly generation. How can they transform the formed into the formless?\"* The Classic states: *\"External things cannot form the embryo; how can flowers strung together bear fruit?\"*\n\nThe *qi* of True Unity arises before heaven and earth, dim and obscure, beyond all measure. Through the correspondence of the two eights, they unite in affinity, and within their misty, resonant interaction, form takes shape. Those of the same kind possess *\"emotion without emotion, color without color\"*—such as eight ounces of crow’s liver or half a catty of hare’s marrow.\n\nZiye said: *\"The Golden Elixir is formed by the union of true yin and true yang—it cannot be made from external medicines.\"* The word *\"kind\"* is of utmost importance: the union of yin and yang depends on finding its kind; without it, all efforts are in vain. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Like attracts like; discordant affairs yield no treasure. Swallows do not hatch phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses.\"*\n\nThe correspondence of the two eights depends on the adept. With the right person, the medicine suffers no loss, and the crucible knows no leakage. The medicine resides in the lower *dantian*, tempered by fire, like the sun over a pond—within the body, all yin *qi* is consumed. The white moon and new medicinal sprout signify the moment when metal is born within water. The *\"mountain’s peak moon\"* illustrates the *kan* trigram’s proper placement above, thus completing the path of *\"already achieved.\"*\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: *\"The mechanism has its rises and falls; harmful *qi* flees in haste. Like the Yangtze and Huai running dry, their waters flow into the sea.\"* The *\"Song of the Crucible\"* states: *\"Yin above, yang rushes below.\"* How wondrous! Without the true transmission of a genuine master, how dare one presume to speculate with private conjecture?\n\nMercury is the innate treasure of my household; lead is the deathless formula of another. To mistake common cinnabar and quicksilver for these is to guess in vain to the end. Shangyangzi said: *\"The Three Yellows and Four Spirits—such as realgar, sulfur, orpiment, red lead, black lead, mercury, common cinnabar, base elixirs, metals, stones, herbs, and trees—are all false. One must seek true yin and true yang.\"* Thus, the Immortal Elder instructs later generations through the principle of *\"kind\"*—a most profound and earnest teaching.\n\n*\"Kind\"* means heaven pairs with earth, the sun with the moon, woman with man, mercury with lead. The two eights make a catty’s weight; fifteen signifies the moon’s fullness. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"The two sevens gather to assist the human.\"* All point directly to the numerical correspondence of the same kind—neither early nor late, neither more nor less, neither large nor small, neither striving nor wrathful, neither hidden nor deceptive, neither startled nor doubtful. Only when perfectly matched do they unite in harmony.\n\nThe *\"pond’s depths\"* where the elixir coalesces echoes Master Boyang’s words: *\"The true person lurks in the deep abyss.\"* With a single thought firm and unwavering, all distractions vanish, and yin’s aberrations naturally perish. The *\"mountain’s peak\"* is how the Immortal Elder often likens the Mysterious Gate to the summit of Kunlun. When the water is clear and the moon white, one gathers the newly born numinous medicine—this is not common cinnabar or quicksilver, but true lead and true mercury, the *qi* of the sacred father and holy mother. The *qi* of common parents, following the natural course, produces humans and things; the *qi* of sacred parents, reversing the course, gives birth to immortals and buddhas.\n\n*Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected of Purple Yang, Volume One Concluded*\n*Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected of Purple Yang, Volume Two*\n*Annotations by Xue Daoguang the Purple Worthy, Lu Zhu of Ziye, and Chen Zhixu of Shangyangzi*\n\n**Eight Regulated Seven-Character Poems**\n\nWithin yang, yin’s essence lacks firmness;\nCultivating this alone only brings emaciation.\nStraining the body with exercises is not the Way;\nIngesting *qi* and consuming mist is sheer madness.\nThe world vainly seeks to subdue lead and mercury—\nWhen will they witness the dragon and tiger’s descent?\nI urge you to exhaust the source of your birth:\nReturning to the origin, reverting to the root—this is the Medicine King.\n\nDaoguang said: *\"The yin essence in the field is none other than one’s true essence. Essence generates *qi*, *qi* generates spirit—nothing sustains the body more than these. When the oil is exhausted, the lamp dies; when the marrow is depleted, the person perishes. This speaks to essence and *qi* as the very root of the body. Yet this substance belongs to yin—its nature is not firm, its tendency is to flee. Daily, it is lost through urine, sweat, tears, and saliva, easily dissipated and difficult to capture, resisting refinement and control. Without the primordial True Unity’s elixir to subdue it, there can be no coagulation or transformation. Cultivating this alone only leads to further emaciation. Straining the body with exercises is not the true path; consuming mist and refining *qi* are the ways of the deluded. Even if one swallows the sun and moon’s essence, illuminating the five viscera, or circulates the double passes, shakes the spine, replenishes the brain, and returns essence—even achieving corpse liberation, entering trance, or mastering a thousand methods—it is still only the solitary cultivation of yin within yang. Solitary yin without yang is like a hen trying to hatch an egg alone—how difficult to succeed! As Master Zhongli said: 'Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and humors—these seven substances are all yin. If one takes these as the elixir’s foundation, how can the spirit ascend to the Jade Capital?'\"*",
      "overlap_context": "ite their virtue, sun and moon unite their brightness—the true mechanism of generation and transformation. Reversing and cultivating it, one transcends the ordinary and enters sagehood. Thus, the Immortal Elder most urgently emphasizes swiftly gathering when *gui* is born.\n\nSending it back to the earthen crucible, pairing it with flowing pearls, regulating the fire’s timing—this completes the sacred embryo. I now reveal heaven and earth’s mechanism to clarify the Immortal Elder’s earnest intent.",

      "translated_text": "Within the body, not only is true essence a yin substance—all five viscera and six bowels are yin, devoid of yang. Dividing heart and kidney into Kan and Li, taking liver and lung as dragon and tiger, employing spirit and *qi* as mother and child, grasping fluids and humors as lead and mercury—can this succeed? Such are the ways of the utterly foolish, who cling to these methods to cultivate the body and seek the state of pure yang. How lamentable!\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* states:\n*\"Remove cold by adding ice, dispel heat with broth.\nThe flying tortoise lacks the snake—how much more perverse!\"*\n\nEven if two maidens share a chamber, their complexions vastly different, and one sends Su Qin to mediate, Zhang Yi to broker the match, loosening their braids and wielding silver tongues to craft honeyed words, baring their hearts to harmonize—though they become husband and wife, their hair will rot and teeth decay, and still they will never know each other. This is no different from a woman marrying a woman, refining yin with yin.\n\nDaoist exercises, massage, *qi*-refinement, and mist-consumption are but minor arts, sufficient only to ward off illness. Should one cease practice even for a day, all prior effort is undone. *The Kinship of the Three* says:\n*\"The yin path scorns the nine-and-one,\ndefiling the primordial womb with turbid chaos.\nSwallowing *qi* gurgles in the stomach,\nspitting out the true to inhale external evil.\nDay and night without rest,\nceaseless from new moon to dark.\nThe body grows weary and sore,\ndazed as if deranged—\nall forced effort, far from the Dao.\"*\n\nThe true dragon and true tiger are the two eights. The true lead and true mercury are the *qi* of the two crescents. This path is utterly simple, not complex; utterly near, not distant. Yet students stubbornly cling to postnatal side doors and heterodox schools, mistaking them for dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, thus straying far afield.\n\nThey fail to consider that the immortal elders directly point to the source of these two substances—the very wellspring from which body and life arise. Returning to this root, reverting to this source, and inverting the practice will cause the true dragon and true tiger to descend of themselves, the true lead and true mercury to submit naturally. If not the sovereign of medicines, who could achieve this?\n\nSome compare the Primordial Jade Elixir to the sagely Dao, as if grasping bamboo to point at the moon—how far removed! For all postnatal things with form and substance are not the supreme medicine.\n\nMaster Ziye said: *The Book of Changes* states, *\"When male and female commingle essence, the myriad things transform and arise.\"* My own body came into being through the union of my parents’ essence. Had there been a father without a mother, or a mother without a father, how could this body exist? The essentials of elixir-making share the same vital impulse as procreation; the difference lies only in reversal or sequence. Proceeding in order gives birth to a person; proceeding in reverse gives birth to the elixir. Between reversal and sequence, heaven and earth stand as far apart as can be.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: *The Kinship* states,\n*\"This is not the method of traversing the viscera;\ninner vision is but idle thought.\nThe yin path scorns the nine-and-one,\ndefiling the primordial womb with turbid chaos.\"*\nThe arts are myriad, a thousand strands with ten thousand branches.\n\nImmortal Peng said: The world does not follow the primordial origin of the great Dao but instead pursues side doors and crooked paths—of these there are many kinds, all left-handed ways that deviate from heavenly principle, disrupt the perfection of the true, openly defy the words of the Yellow Emperor, and wholly lose the intent of Laozi. They seek eternal life but instead harm their own existence.\n\nMaster Zhongli said: *\"The gate that gives me life is the door that brings my death.\"* How profound! The superior sages have spoken, yet none among the lesser ranks can bear the burden. Why? Because the world clings to self-cultivation, and thus a thousand paths and a hundred trails are nothing but side doors.\n\nThe immortal elders, moved by compassion, directly reveal the place from which our very existence is drawn—would this not be too blatant a disclosure of heavenly mechanism? Yet people come into this world bound by karma and consciousness, and they depart the same way. The solitary yang flees and is lost; though the form is male, the body within is all yin. If one clings to the self alone in cultivation, how can one return to the origin and revert to the root? Unable to return to the origin and revert to the root, how then can one reverse yang and transform the bones?\n\nThus, the great practitioner seeks the precelestial true lead, and must seek it from the very place where one first received *qi* and was born. Only then can one obtain the precelestial true unity of *qi*, returning to the origin and reverting to the root.\n\nThis is how men and women cultivate. For women who seek immortality, the breasts are the seat of generative *qi*, and the method is even simpler. Thus, men cultivate immortality by refining *qi*, while women cultivate immortality by refining form. Women first accumulate *qi* in the breasts, then establish the cauldron and furnace to practice the Great Yin method of refining form. This path is the easiest to achieve the Dao, possessing subtle and wondrous principles.\n\nDuring the Xuanhe era, Lü Dongbin traveled to Wuxing and encountered a courtesan named Zhang Zhennu, whose beauty and grace were radiant, and whose nature favored simplicity. Though fallen among the wind and dust, each evening she bathed, changed clothes, lit incense, and prayed to heaven, earnestly seeking liberation.",

      "translated_text": "Lü Dongbin disguised himself as a scholar and visited her. Zhang Zhennu, struck by his extraordinary bearing, held him in deep reverence. They enjoyed each other’s company to the fullest, yet the scholar departed as lightly as he had come. The next day, he returned in the same manner, and this continued for over a month—never once did they engage in licentiousness.\n\nZhang Zhennu said, “I have long been favored by your springtime visits, yet you never stay the night to share the pleasures of pillow and mat. Could it be that my humble self is unworthy of your company?”\n\nThe scholar replied, “Not so. What is truly precious is the meeting of minds—why must it be otherwise? Moreover, each night you pray to heaven—what is it you seek?”\n\nZhennu said, “Having lost myself in this life, what else could I do? Yet I reflect: since entering this profession, I have recklessly applied powder and rouge, passing falsehood for truth. I sing lewd songs and perform wanton dances, turning sorrow into mirth. This body is but a sack of foul pus, adorned with deception to ensnare others. I often lament how foolish men, failing to honor their own worth, pass through my door, captivated by my flower-like allure. Their hearts ensnared, their minds bewitched, they not only squander their wealth but often meet their ruin. Though I feign joy in these encounters, I feel the weight of my sin deeply. Thus, I pray morning and night to escape this life.”\n\nThe scholar said, “What is your aspiration? Why not cultivate the Dao?”\n\nZhennu replied, “Trapped in this place, how could I find a teacher?”\n\nThe scholar said, “I could be your teacher.”\n\nZhennu immediately bowed and kowtowed. The scholar said, “Come again, and it may be so.” Then he left.\n\nZhennu waited day and night, but he did not return. Overcome with regret, she wrote:\n\n*Met my teacher for so long,*\n*Yet not a word of truth was spoken.*\n*How I long to sit with him once more—*\n*Regret consumes me as time slips away,*\n*Leaving me now with nothing but sorrow.*\n\nBefore she could finish writing, the scholar suddenly appeared. Seeing her words, he continued the verse:\n\n*The Dao holds no clever secrets,*\n*I’ll give you the method, brother mine.*\n*At midnight and noon, sit in stillness,*\n*Guide the qi through the spine’s twin passes to Kunlun’s height.*\n*When you gain this strength,*\n*Think of me.*\n\nZhennu rejoiced greatly. The scholar then taught her the Great Yin method of refining form and the Great Elixir technique. From that moment, her spirit and *qi* flourished as if she had attained profound awakening. Unbeknownst to others, she received even more esoteric teachings, which she kept secret.\n\nBefore parting, she composed *Stepping into the Toad Palace*:\n\n*Kan and Li, Kun and Dui divide at Zi and Wu,*\n*First recognize your own ancestral root.*\n*The thunder shakes the mountain, rain descends—*\n*Wash the yellow sprout until it breaks the soil.*\n*Seize the golden essence, bind it fast,*\n*Distinguish Jia and Geng, let dragon and tiger arise.*\n*When asked who transmitted this,*\n*Say only: the master’s surname is Lü.*\n\nOnly then did Zhennu realize he was Master Lü. She feigned madness and begged in the marketplace, then retreated to a remote place to secretly practice the method. After three years, she departed through *shi jie* (corpse liberation).\n\nThe path of cultivation knows no distinction between men and women. If one’s resolve is fierce and their will unyielding, they will surely attain the Dao.\n\n*Diligently seek true lead,*\n*Lest time slip by so easily.*\n*Capture the earthly *po* to subdue cinnabar mercury,*\n*And the heavenly *hun* will naturally govern watery metal.*\n*This is how the Dao tames dragon and tiger,*\n*And how virtue commands the reverence of gods and spirits.*\n*Once you know your lifespan equals heaven and earth,*\n*No affliction will ever trouble your heart again.*\n\nDaoguang said: “True lead is the golden elixir. The earthly *po* in the outer medicine is the White Tiger; in the inner medicine, it is the golden elixir itself. The heavenly *hun* in the outer medicine is the Azure Dragon; in the inner medicine, it is one’s true essence. Cinnabar mercury in the outer medicine is the dragon’s *qi* of the waxing moon; in the inner medicine, it is one’s true *qi*. Watery metal in the outer medicine is the tiger’s *qi* of the waning moon; in the inner medicine, it is the golden elixir—also called silver in water. These all metaphorically describe the medicines of inner and outer alchemy.\n\nYet with each passing day, life wanes. We must earnestly seek a teacher and swiftly cultivate the golden elixir to transcend life and death. Capture the White Tiger to subdue the dragon, and the Azure Dragon will naturally restrain the tiger. When the two *qi* devour each other, the golden elixir is born. Then, use this elixir to capture your own true *qi*, and the true *qi* will naturally cling to the elixir, forming the sacred embryo.\n\nOnce the true dragon and tiger of the outer world are subdued, the inner dragon and tiger will submit of their own accord. When the inner refinement of spirit, *hun*, ghost, and *po* attains sanctity, the gods and spirits of the outer world will naturally revere you. Who but one whose Dao is lofty and virtue complete could achieve this? With a body transformed into pure yang, lifespan equaling heaven and earth, one roams beyond the mundane yet dwells freely in the world. All worldly thoughts dissolve—what affliction could remain?\n\nZiye said: “The earthly *po* is lead; the heavenly *hun* is mercury. Use lead to govern mercury—this is the interplay of self and other.”\n\nShangyangzi said: “Diligently seek true lead.” Pure Yang Elder said: “Begin swiftly, for even now it may be too late. Since ancient times, all sagely teachers have urged their disciples to start early, enter the chamber, and seek the true lead—a task most difficult. The poor worry they lack wealth; the wealthy worry they lack land; those with land worry they lack materials; those with materials worry they lack companions. Companions here mean external protectors.\n\nTo ‘diligently seek’ is to first gather the means, then choose a place. Thus, the Immortal Elder said: ‘At first, when there is work to be done, no one sees it.’ If the place is not suitable, others will see it, and it cannot be used.\n\nBefore I entered the chamber, I did not pay much heed to this. Only when the time came did I earnestly seek and select, realizing how difficult it truly was—how much toil it required. Thus, I understood that even ‘diligently seeking’ is no easy feat. Yet most people, after receiving a single method from their teacher, idly waste time, unaware that with each passing year, their vitality declines, and death approaches all too soon.\n\nThe earthly *po* is the very thing you seek. The heavenly *hun* is the mercury you have accumulated. The dragon of the Eastern Sea can govern the moon’s *po* of the Western River; the White Tiger of the Western River can refine the sun’s *hun* of your own house. When *hun* and *po* unite in essence, *qian* and *kun* share the same lifespan. In aiding others and engaging with the world, your virtue will grow, and even gods and spirits will revere you.”",

      "translated_text": "Cultivate the self with an empty heart, and the Dao’s height subdues dragon and tiger. When all the dusts and leaks of Jambudvīpa are exhausted, afflictions vanish entirely. The true joy of immortals is no fleeting thing—only through skillful means does one attain great freedom, and this is the foremost accumulation of merit.\n\nYellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find, yet the enlightened must rely on deep virtue. The Four Symbols and Five Phases depend wholly on earth; how could the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams ever depart from *ren*? When the numinous essence is refined, people fail to recognize it; when all demons are dissolved, ghosts dare not intrude. Should one wish to leave secret formulas among humankind, not a single soul would prove a true confidant.\n\n**Dao Guang says:** The dragon’s string of *qi* is called white snow; the tiger’s string of *qi* is called yellow sprouts. The root of the great elixir truly lies herein. The Dao is utterly simple, its affairs not remote. Yet without grand merit and mighty deeds, one cannot encounter a true teacher to point out the profound mysteries.\n\nThe Dao arises from emptiness and gives birth to the One *qi*; the One *qi* transforms into yin and yang, called dragon and tiger. The dragon, wood, generates fire; the tiger, metal, generates water. Wood, fire, metal, and water combine to form the Four Symbols. When the Four Symbols unite, the great elixir is completed—its completion truly depends on earth. Earth has no fixed form; it divides its position among the four seasons and four times. Without the true earth of the four seasons, the four sequences cannot proceed, and how could creation arise? Thus, the Four Symbols and Five Phases rely entirely on earth.\n\n*Ren* is water, the true One *qi* born before heaven and earth, transforming into yang-dragon and yin-tiger to merge and form the elixir. The elixir is earth; the dragon is wood; the tiger is metal—these are called the Three Natures. The Three Origins do not depart from the transformation of the true One’s water. The Eight Trigrams are the true One’s *qi*: first, it transforms into heaven, called *Qian*, the father; second, it transforms into earth, called *Kun*, the mother. *Qian*, with its yang *qi*, seeks *Kun*’s yin *qi*—once sought, it gives birth to the eldest son, *Zhen*; twice sought, the middle son, *Kan*; thrice sought, the youngest son, *Gen*. This is *Qian* uniting with *Kun* to give birth to the three yang. *Kun*, with its yin *qi*, seeks *Qian*’s yang *qi*—once sought, it gives birth to the eldest daughter, *Xun*; twice sought, the middle daughter, *Li*; thrice sought, the youngest daughter, *Dui*. This is *Kun* uniting with *Qian* to give birth to the three yin. All do not depart from the transformation of the true One’s water, hence: how could the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams ever depart from *ren*?\n\nNot only do the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams not depart from the essence of the true One, but since the beginning of creation, all that has form arises from this and transforms. The cultivator who obtains the true One’s water has accomplished all things. When the true One’s water is transformed by method into the true One’s grain of millet, swallowed into the cinnabar field and fired for ten months, all yin is smelted away. The pure yang immortal of the true One—yin demons, corpse-ghosts flee with no escape. When the root of goodness is planted, the numinous bone grows; when the numinous bone grows, immortality may be hoped for. The growth of the numinous bone is the planting of the root of goodness—not in one or two lifetimes, but through countless eons, accumulating all good roots. How could one, having just emerged, already bear the ethereal air of transcending the dust?\n\nAlas! Wandering ghosts and moving corpses, with a single bottle and bowl, may wish to ascend as immortals—yet immortals are not easily attained. Why not examine one’s own heart and ask whether it differs from the common heart? My immortal affairs also have their limits. One must broadly transform and adapt, taking the Dao as one’s duty, standing alone above the world, a crane among chickens. Though people laugh at me as wild and unrestrained, I know I am no ordinary sort. Red Pine and yellow essence are my friends; Penglai and Fangzhang are my home. Naturally, one will encounter perfected beings, receive the transmission of the supreme Dao, unite with kindred spirits, and with earnest care, complete the elixir.\n\nThe immortal elder wished to leave secret teachings among humankind—yet how could he meet his Ziyu? How might one find another like myself?\n\n**Ziye says:** Yellow sprouts are the essence of lead; white snow is the *qi* of mercury. Those who seek them must possess virtue. Earth is *wu* and *ji*; *ren* is the true One’s water, the ancestral *qi* that gives life to all things.\n\n**Shangyangzi says:** Yellow sprouts and white snow are the true One’s *qi* produced within primal darkness. Earlier, it was said that true lead must be diligently sought—here, it is said that yellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find, for they depend on virtue. Foolish disciples see these two verses as contradictory, yet they do not know that without virtue, this Dao can never complete the elixir. The proverb says: “If your words are pure but your conduct is turbid, do not speak of the Dao.” One who knows the Dao but has not accumulated virtue is like a fish without water, a lamp without oil—how could the returning elixir be achieved? The Four Symbols, Five Phases, Three Origins, and Eight Trigrams have many names, yet none can do without the true One’s *ren*-water.\n\nMy Yellow Chamber Master praised the Old Immortal of Pure Yang, saying: “The crucible gathers the Four Symbols and Five Phases; the medicine follows the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams. The red phoenix spits the marrow of the southern direction; the black turtle holds the essence of the northern sea.” This is what he meant—all trace back to the verse of Pure Yang: “The crucible follows the center of the four seasons; the medicine moves with the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams.” The same idea.\n\nThough the true immortal sages and teachers are compassionate in guidance, it truly depends on one’s own conduct. Once this elixir is completed, the Jade Emperor bestows praise, and the ten thousand spirits of heaven and earth all revere it—hence its name: the Supreme Perfected Numinous Treasure, the Wondrous Nine-Return Great Elixir. Long ago, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning expounded the scriptures to save beings; the empty platform of the mysterious seat suspended a treasure pearl as large as a grain of millet—this was it. The Mahāyāna Prajñā’s nine-grade lotus dais, the luminous treasury, the wish-fulfilling wondrous Dharma, the numinous-responsive *maṇi* jewel—this was the pearl the dragon girl offered at the Vulture Peak assembly. Its preciousness cannot be described—how could the people of the world recognize it?",
      "overlap_context": "eclines, and death approaches all too soon.\n\nThe earthly *po* is the very thing you seek. The heavenly *hun* is the mercury you have accumulated. The dragon of the Eastern Sea can govern the moon’s *po* of the Western River; the White Tiger of the Western River can refine the sun’s *hun* of your own house. When *hun* and *po* unite in essence, *qian* and *kun* share the same lifespan. In aiding others and engaging with the world, your virtue will grow, and even gods and spirits will revere you.”",

      "translated_text": "When the elixir is completed, the body becomes sacred, and the yang spirit manifests—this is called the Perfected One. The yin demons and ghostly thieves transform into guardian deities; the Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior within the body, along with the three *hun*, seven *po*, Three Origins and Nine Palaces, Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries, five viscera and eight consciousnesses, all become spirits. The thirty-six thousand radiant essences transform into divine soldiers.\n\nAt that time, the Immortal Elder wished to transmit the secret oral instructions to others, yet in an entire generation, few would believe, receive, and practice them. Alas! To bow to a master while still bound in fetters—such are the disciples who come after the Apricot Grove.\n\nGrasses and trees, too, balance yin and yang;\nIf either is lacking, no fragrance will bloom.\nFirst, green leaves unfold as yang takes the lead,\nThen red flowers follow as yin comes along.\nThis is the common Way, our daily practice—\nYet who knows the true source’s reversals and turns?\n\nThe Radiance of the Dao says: Before grasses and trees sprout, they contain the purest simplicity. When their husks split, they receive the one qi to germinate, thus drawing forth a single leaf to symbolize that one qi. Next, two leaves divide to represent yin and yang, and from between them emerges another leaf to correspond to the Three Powers. Beyond this, they gradually grow lush: in spring, green leaves appear; in summer, red flowers bloom—this is the work of yang qi. In autumn, they wither and bear fruit; in winter, they die back to their roots—this is the work of yin qi. When yin and yang are balanced, generation never ceases; if either is lacking, the myriad things cannot arise.\n\nTrue Unity Master says: Solitary yin cannot generate itself; solitary yang cannot complete itself. Thus, when heaven and earth intermingle in misty vapor, the myriad things transform and harmonize. When male and female unite in essence, the myriad things are born. This is the common Way, our daily practice.\n\nAs for the true source’s reversals: there is a profound mechanism of inversion and mutual exchange. If scholars do not understand this, how can they transcend life and death?\n\nZiye says: The Way of the Golden Elixir is like the yin and yang of grasses and trees. When grasses and trees first sense yang qi, they immediately sprout buds; later, flowers follow in succession, blooming and then withering to bear fruit within. Likewise, when one obtains this single point of true yang qi, true yin naturally blends with it to form the embryo. The mutual dependence of yin and yang is generally like this—this is the common Way of daily practice. Yet where the true source reverses, it remains obscure; this is what the common people use daily yet do not know.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: Heaven produces two kinds of things—those that move and those that are still. Roots belong to the still, feet to the moving, yet all receive the yin and yang qi. Grasses and trees are still, inanimate things, yet they follow the yang spring to grow and bear fruit. Humans and creatures are moving, sentient beings—without the yin and yang qi, how could they be born and raised? Humans are the most numinous of beings, endowed with the upright qi of heaven and earth, yet they do not understand the Way of yin and yang’s waxing and waning, reversal and compliance.\n\nI now reveal it fully: when qi flows in compliance, it produces ordinary fathers and mothers; when it flows in reversal, it produces numinous fathers and sacred mothers. When the qi of ordinary fathers and mothers flows in compliance, it forms a person—this is the common Way. When the qi of numinous fathers and sacred mothers flows in reversal, it forms the elixir—this is the true source. \"Reversal\" means the male returns to being female, and the female returns to being male. Without encountering a true master, what benefit is there in mere talk?\n\nIf you do not know the inversion within the mysterious,\nHow can you plant lotuses in fire?\nDraw the White Tiger home to nurture,\nAnd bear a bright pearl like the full moon.\nDo not merely guard the furnace and watch the fire;\nSimply calm the spirit and rest in naturalness.\nWhen all yin dissolves, the elixir ripens,\nAnd you leap from the mortal cage to live ten thousand years.\n\nThe Radiance of the Dao says: By human affairs, a man cannot become pregnant, nor can lotuses be planted in fire. Yet the immortals possess the marvel of inversion, enabling a man to conceive—just as lotuses are planted in fire. The sun is *li*, male, yet reversed, it becomes female. The moon is *kan*, female, yet reversed, it becomes male. This is inversion. When these two things invert, the elixir is born; then, using this elixir to refine one’s own mercury and form the sacred embryo is like a male brother becoming pregnant—is this not inversion upon inversion?\n\nThe Dragon and Tiger are the essence of True Unity, transformed into two things, positioned east and west, yet when they emerge, they bear different names. The essence of True Unity belongs to mercury, the Green Dragon, in the east. The White Tiger is originally the child of True Unity’s essence, lodged in the west, though its home is in the east. The Immortal Elder says:\n\nGolden Duke is originally the son of the eastern house,\nSent to the western neighbor to lodge and grow.\nIf you recognize and call him home to nurture,\nPair him with the Maiden to form a bond of kinship.\n\nThus, the poem’s meaning is to draw the White Tiger home, uniting it with the Green Dragon as husband and wife to produce the bright pearl. The phrase \"like the full moon\" refers to the method of refining the elixir: first, take the half-moon from the western side at the waxing crescent to obtain eight ounces of yang metal. Next, take the half-moon from the eastern side at the waning crescent to obtain half a pound of yin water. When these two half-moons merge their qi, they generate the elixir—thus, a single grain of golden elixir resembles the full moon. This is the external medicine’s symbolic method.\n\nWhen this elixir is swallowed into one’s belly, it is called drawing the White Tiger into one’s own abdomen to pair with one’s mercury. Then, by circulating yin talismans and yang fire to refine it, the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir is formed, a single grain weighing one pound. This is the internal medicine’s symbolic method. The \"full moon\" here refers to the hexagrams of fire circulation: one hexagram has six lines, and sixty-four hexagrams total three hundred eighty-four lines, symbolizing one pound and three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. As for the external medicine’s symbolism resembling the full moon, the *Cantong Qi* says: \"The waxing crescent’s *dui* number is eight; the waning crescent’s *gen* is also eight. When the essences of the two crescents unite, the body of *qian* and *kun* is complete.\"",

      "translated_text": "The two eights correspond to one pound—this is the unerring principle of the *Yi*’s Dao. The immortal master’s instruction on the full moon’s meaning aims to make Dao-seekers thoroughly comprehend the essence of creation and transformation. The two eights of inner and outer must not be conflated in discussion.\n\nFire here is not the common fire of the world, but the primordial ancestral *qi*—there is no furnace to guard. As Qingxiazi said:\n*\"The crucible is no metal crucible,\nThe furnace no jade furnace.\nFire arises from *li* below,\nWater accords with *kan* within.\nOnce the three clans unite,\nThe two substances naturally converge.\nSealed firm, the embryo does not leak—\nTransformation occurs in an instant.\"*\n\nGaoxiangxian said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth in misty union, male and female mate,\nThe four images and five phases follow in harmony.\nDay and night, *zhun* and *meng* obey nature’s law—\nWhy laboriously watch the fire’s timing?\"*\nThis is the natural furnace and fire.\n\nSimply settle the spirit and regulate the breath, harmonize the civil and correct the errant, and mark the talismanic clepsydra—without the slightest deviation. In less than half a *shi*, the elixir is immediately obtained. Then, following the advance and retreat of yin talismans and yang fire, apply the methods of withdrawal and addition, guarding against danger and peril. After ten months of work, all yin is stripped away, the body transforms into pure yang, and one leaps from the mortal cage to attain ten thousand years of longevity.\n\nThis method yields the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir, yet it has not yet entered the profound. One must further refine it for nine years, causing *qi* to return to spirit, to achieve the Nine-Turned Great Returned Elixir of Golden Liquid.\n\nZiye said: *\"Reversing yin and yang\"* means yin contains yang, and yang contains yin. *\"Planting lotus in fire\"*—fire contains water, yin contains yang, death holds life. The White Tiger is the essence of metal: white describes its nature, tiger its difficulty to subdue. The essence of metal is originally one’s own substance, but since birth, it has fled elsewhere. Now, recognizing it anew, one exerts effort to draw it back. Like the moon, like a pearl—such is the symbol of the medicine.\n\nAfter obtaining the medicine, the method of nurturing it: settle the spirit, stabilize the breath, and let it proceed naturally—this is not what is meant by rigidly guarding the elixir furnace, adding eight ounces at dawn and replacing half a pound at dusk.\n\nShangyangzi said: Yin and yang possess the mechanism of reversal; the Golden Elixir has the art of return. *\"Planting lotus in fire\"* is returning *kan* to *li*. The White Tiger is a hard-to-control substance, the *qi* contained by the Great One. Drawing it home means subduing its *qi*—the bright pearl becomes the elixir. Once the elixir is obtained, circulate one’s own mercury and regulate spirit and breath to nurture it. As *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The true person breathes from the heels.\"* Guangchengzi said: *\"The cinnabar furnace and river chariot rest idle—\nThe crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath flow on endlessly.\"*\nThis refers to the spirit’s breath.\n\nWait until yin is exhausted and yang is pure to become a true person, transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood.\n\n*\"Three, five, one\"—three words in all,\nRare indeed are those who understand through the ages.\nEast’s three and south’s two together make five,\nNorth’s one and west’s four complete it.\nWu and ji reside in the generative number five—\nThe three families meet to form the infant.\nThe infant is the one containing true *qi*;\nAfter ten months, the embryo is complete, entering the foundation of sagehood.*\n\nDaoguang said: Wood’s number is three, dwelling in the east. Fire’s number is two, dwelling in the south. Wood can generate fire, and the two substances share an office—thus two and three combine to form one five. Metal’s number is four, dwelling in the west. Water’s number is one, dwelling in the north. Metal can generate water, and the two substances share an office—thus four and one combine to form two fives. Wu and ji’s original number is five—this is the three fives. The three fives unite as one, hence *\"three, five, one.\"* From ancient times to now, those who can unite the three fives into one to form the elixir are truly rare.\n\nThe *\"one\"* is the elixir—it is the true *qi* of that, the mother of heaven and earth before their existence. My true *qi* is the child of heaven and earth. Using the mother’s *qi* to subdue the child’s *qi* is like trapping a mouse so it does not escape. The mother and child’s *qi* cherish each other within the womb, forming the infant. The so-called *\"Great One containing true *qi*\"* means containing the true *qi* of the one. Like a person carrying a child, after ten months, the saintly embryo naturally descends. When the work is complete, one naturally becomes divine and sagely—hence *\"after ten months, the embryo is complete, entering the foundation of sagehood.\"*\n\nZiye said: *\"Three, five, one\"* refers to the numbers of the five phases: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The *\"one\"* is the Supreme Ultimate. When the five phases are not united, each retains its nature; when united, they revert to the one Supreme Ultimate. If one can unite the five phases into one, one returns to primordial chaos, and the infant has its sign. Such is the wonder of the meaning of *\"the three families meeting.\"*\n\nAfter ten months, the numerical cycle is complete, the time and *qi* transform, naturally aligning with the mechanism of the ancient sages.\n\nShangyangzi said: Heaven’s three generates wood; earth’s two generates fire. Fire’s number is two, wood’s number is three—three and two share the same nature, together forming one five. Wood symbolizes the east, its image the Azure Dragon. The dragon’s *qi* is mercury fire, dwelling in the south, its image the Vermilion Bird. Wood generates fire—wood is the body, fire is the *qi* it generates, thus wood and fire are one family. Yet both are solitary yin within yang, which is why they have different names: *xuan*, *wu*, *miao*—for they possess wood and fire but lack metal, water, *wu*, and earth.\n\nHeaven’s one generates water; earth’s four generates metal. Metal’s number is four, water’s number is one—one and four share the same essence, uniting to form one five. Metal dwells in the west, its image the White Tiger. The tiger’s *qi* is lead water, dwelling in the north, its image the Dark Warrior. Metal generates water—metal is the body, water is the *qi* it generates, thus metal and water are one family. Yet both are solitary yang within yin, which is why they have different names: *pin*, *you*, *jiao*—for they possess metal and water but lack wood, fire, *ji*, and earth.",

      "translated_text": "Heaven’s five is *ji* earth; earth’s ten is *wu* earth. *Wu* earth dwells in *kan*; *ji* earth dwells in *li*. When *wu* and *ji* are divided, the two earths number ten; when *wu* and *ji* unite, the two earths form a *gui* and number five. Earth dwells in the center, thus becoming one five. In sum, this is the three fives.\n\nThunder-wood and fire of *li* share the same nature, forming one family. The dragon is the gate of *zhen*, and mercury is produced within. Metal of *dui* and water of *kan* share the same essence, forming one family. The tiger is the gate of *dui*, and lead is born within. *Li*-*ji* and *kan*-*wu* share the same root, forming one family. The Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior unite to generate beings. These are called the three families. The dragon and Vermilion Bird intend to give life to humans; the tiger and Dark Warrior intend to kill humans—this is the law of the world. If one wishes to transcend the law of the world, one must invert and restrain them. To what end is the merit attributed to the two earths, *wu* and *ji*? Metal naturally cherishes wood’s kindness and benevolence, yet inwardly harbors a compliant nature, and thus has no means to unite on its own. Though wood loves metal’s obedience and righteousness, it inwardly harbors a crooked and upright nature—how could it act as its own matchmaker? To bring about their union, the merit lies in the two earths, which convey their mutual affinity.\n\nMoreover, *wu* earth generates metal, desiring metal’s *qi* to flourish and mutually support one another. *Ji* is overcome by wood, so one must first refine *ji* with care to seek the elixir. If one does not refine *ji* and await the proper time, one cannot achieve constant response and stillness. Once the refinement of *ji* is complete, it unites with *wu*. When *wu* and *ji* unite, metal and wood meet. When metal and wood meet, dragon and tiger merge. When dragon and tiger merge, the three fives become one. When the three fives become one, the three families meet. When the three families meet, lead and mercury conjoin. When lead and mercury conjoin, the infant is formed. All arises from this single *qi*.\n\nThe Buddha and Patriarchs said: Within heaven and earth, between the cosmos, there is a chamber, hidden within the mountain of form. This is the marvel of the Great One containing the true *qi*. Thus, when the five phases are divided, they are called the true Dao; when the five phases unite, they generate one *qi*; when one *qi* congeals, it forms the infant; when the infant emerges, it becomes the true person.\n\nIf one does not recognize the true lead as the rightful ancestor, all efforts are vainly expended. Forsaking one’s wife only severs yin and yang; fasting only empties the stomach and intestines. Herbs, trees, gold, and silver are all impure substances; clouds, mist, sun, and moon belong to the realm of obscurity. Even if one practices breath control and visualization, all differ from the work of the golden elixir.\n\nDao Guang said: The essence of true lead lies in the two eights as its foundation; all else is not the Dao, and efforts are vainly expended. The *Song of Breaking Delusion* says: Forsaking one’s wife is not the Dao, for yin and yang lose their proper positions. Fasting is not the Dao, for one dies and becomes a hungry ghost.\n\nMaster Wang the True said: If a student stubbornly rejects wives and concubines, they fail to comprehend non-action and the action of non-action. The body of the Dao follows nature; all reckless actions—how can they be spoken of in the same breath as the golden elixir?\n\nZi Ye said: Forsaking one’s wife and fasting—what do these accomplish? Herbs, trees, gold, and silver are material things. Clouds, mist, sun, and moon are external, guest *qi*. Breath control and visualization are all delusory actions. None of these pertain to the meaning of true lead refining true mercury, and they are far removed from the Dao of the golden elixir.\n\nMaster Shang Yang said: True lead is the *qi* of the numinous father and holy mother. Without this *qi*, with what would one enter the chamber and apply effort? People born between heaven and earth receive the essence of their mundane father and the blood of their mundane mother to form their bodies. Thus, the Dao of cultivating immortality and becoming a buddha does not lie beyond this. What differs is that one must have the numinous father and holy mother to be true lead.\n\nWhat is numinous? Constant response and stillness are called numinous; inverting and applying creation is called numinous. What is holy? The initial division of the Great Ultimate is called holy; the tiger not harming humans is called holy. Only with this numinosity and holiness can one know the ancestor of true lead.\n\nWithin a person’s body, there is only so much essence and *qi*. If one exhausts them through leakage, how can the body endure? If one treasures and preserves them, the body remains healthy and life is prolonged. If one further obtains true lead and refines it, how can one not become an immortal? If worldly people lack a good teacher’s instructions to reveal the one thing, true lead, even if they practice all three thousand six hundred side doors, they will only suffer harm in vain. How could they hope for success?\n\nThe words of ten thousand volumes of immortal classics all converge: the golden elixir has only this as its root and origin. Relying on the *kun* position to generate the formed body, plant it in the *qian* household’s chamber of mutual resonance. Do not blame the celestial mechanism for being fully revealed—it is only because scholars remain deluded. If one comprehends the meaning within this poem, one will immediately behold the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Venerable.\n\nDao Guang said: The myriad alchemical classics ultimately return to one principle: all rely on the principle of the *kun* mother’s generation, reversed and cultivated, planted in the *qian* household’s chamber of mutual resonance. The immortal elders have revealed all celestial mechanisms here, yet scholars remain stubbornly deluded, unwilling to seek it within themselves to illuminate the supreme Dao and refine a single grain of millet to become a guest of heaven.\n\nZi Ye said: She is the *kun* position; I am the *qian* household. Borrowing the *qi* of generation from within *kun*, I plant the numinous root beneath my own garden to form the sacred embryo.\n\nMaster Shang Yang said: The marvel of the golden elixir does not lie beyond lead and mercury as its root and origin. If worldly people do not know that the golden elixir has a root and origin, they do not know the marvel of the inner and outer two elixirs. Establishing the furnace and setting up the tripod is external. The *qian* household and *kun* position are external. *Li*-*ji* and *kan*-*wu* are external. Metal essence and wood liquid are internal. Red lead and black mercury are internal. The primordial one *qi* is internal. Though this primordial one *qi* is said to be within, it comes from without. Thus, immortal teachers have the secret instruction of relying on another to plant it.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: Cinnabar and wood essence unite only when they obtain metal. It also says: The flowing pearl of the great yang constantly seeks to leave humans. Only when it obtains the flower of metal does it turn and follow.",

      "translated_text": "Great and small refer to yin and yang. The *Book of Changes* states: \"The great departs, the small arrives.\" The toad’s radiance shining upon the Western River signifies metal within water.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe eldest son of Qian is Zhen, denoting greatness and governing the production of mercury. The youngest daughter of Kun is Dui, denoting smallness and governing the production of lead. When Zhen and Dui harmonize, what harm is there? \"Both states preserved\" means that since the other suffers no loss, I too may accomplish the work. True lead is born in Dui, and Dui resides in the west.\n\n\"Before refining the returning elixir, do not enter the mountains,\nFor within them, both inside and out, no lead is found.\nThis supreme treasure exists in every household,\nYet fools fail to recognize it in full.\"\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe dragon is not in the eastern sea, nor the tiger in the Western River. It exists in every household. Reverse the process and cultivate it, and the returning elixir may be hoped for.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nTo regain what was lost is called \"returning.\"\nTo bring back what has departed is called \"reversion.\"\nThe essence of elixir-making lies in nothing but lead.\nThis lead exists in every household—what a pity people do not recognize it!\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nPeople see only a stretch of wondrous mountains and fair waters and say, \"This is a fine place to cultivate the Dao.\" How many have been misled through the ages! Yet what do great rivers and secluded valleys contain? Only trees, stones, deer, and elk—all of these are not of the same kind and cannot be refined into the great returning elixir. To refine the returning elixir, one must seek the same kind. To seek the same kind, one must hide in the bustle of the marketplace. The immortal’s earlier poem already declared, \"Why must one dwell in the deep mountains, guarding solitude?\" This meaning is now made clear—how profoundly it cuts to the truth! This true lead exists in every household, in every person. Yet people pass through life as if in a dream or a drunken stupor, vaguely drifting by. Without meeting a true teacher, who would recognize it?\n\n\"When bamboo splits, it must be mended with bamboo;\nWhen a hen overturns, it must be righted with an egg.\nAll else is not of the same kind—vain effort,\nHow can one obtain true lead to match the sage’s mechanism?\"\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nIf a bamboo vessel breaks, can it be mended with metal or wood? To restore it whole, it must be mended with bamboo. If a hen is overturned, can it be brooded with earth or water? To bring forth wings, it must be covered with an egg.\n\n*Master Tao says:*\nWhen bamboo splits, mend it with bamboo;\nWhen wood breaks, patch it with wood.\nA leaking roof is covered with tiles;\nA weakened man is restored with the same kind.\nTo cultivate celestial immortality, one must seek the same kind—only then does it align with the sage’s mechanism.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nWhen the Perfected One of Purple Yang reaches this point, it is as if he advances step by step.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nFrom ancient times, divine immortals have never spoken plainly.\nTo speak plainly would invite ridicule.\nEven Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingredient Entry* conveys its meaning in just three words:\n\"Do not use common lead; if you use true lead, discard it afterward.\nThis is the true esoteric method of using lead—\nTo use lead yet not use it is the sincere teaching.\"\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nCommon lead is the impure substance of postnatal generation.\nTrue lead is the qi of the true one.\nHuman essence and qi scatter daily, never congealing to form the sacred embryo. The sage refines true lead, captures it, and subdues it, condensing it into cinnabar. Day by day, fire is applied, gradually adding mercury. As mercury’s qi increases, lead’s qi dissipates. Adding mercury and reducing lead—this is the true subtlety. After ten months, the fire is complete, the six hundred hexagrams conclude, lead’s qi ascends and disperses, leaving only a single taste of pure mercury. When lead is exhausted and mercury dried, it transforms into the golden liquid great elixir. The body becomes purely yang, its lifespan equal to heaven’s. Those who study the Dao and reach this point will know the debt to their teacher is hard to repay. They should pledge their hearts beneath the sun and moon, vowing to attain the Dao to repay their teacher’s kindness. To betray a teacher’s kindness is to betray the sun and moon.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe method of using lead is like the snare and trap for catching fish and rabbits. Fish and rabbits are caught by the snare and trap, but once caught, the snare and trap are no longer needed. It is also like smelting silver from lead—once the silver is extracted, the lead is discarded. Those who understand this principle understand how to use lead.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe *Laozi* states: \"Heaven and earth are not wholly efficacious; the sage is not wholly capable; the myriad things are not wholly useful.\" Deeply comprehending this principle reveals the meaning of using true lead and then discarding it.\n\n\"Emptying the heart and filling the belly—both meanings run deep,\nYet emptying the heart is to recognize the heart.\nBetter to refine lead first to fill the belly,\nAnd thus guard the hall filled with gold.\"\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nGuard essence to fill the belly; when the belly is full, the hall is filled with gold and jade. Embrace the one to empty the heart; when the heart is empty, not a speck of dust remains. When the heart is empty, refine lead to control it. When the belly is full, embrace the one to guard it. Both form and spirit attain subtlety, merging with the Dao in truth. Those who refine the elixir must refine lead like gold—do not disturb your essence. If essence is scant, the returning elixir will not form.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nWhen the heart is empty, thoughts are pure, and not a speck of dust remains. When the belly is full, the elixir is formed, and the four great elements are secure. With pure thoughts and the elixir formed, both form and spirit attain subtlety.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nWithout diligent self-cultivation, one cannot empty the heart of desire or fully preserve essence and cut off lust. When the work of refining lead is mastered, one cannot but fill the belly and fully preserve spirit. An empty heart is always responsive; a full belly is always tranquil. Always responsive, always tranquil—always pure and still. Today, people squander their essence and qi to the point of exhaustion because they do not recognize the heart. The immortal teaches to guard the hall filled with gold and jade—only then can one return to the root and revert to the origin.\n\n\"I dreamed of ascending to the Nine Heavens to meet the Western Flower,\nWhere the Perfected One bestowed upon me the *Finger-Pointing to the Mystery*.\nIts words were few and simple,\nTeaching only to refine mercury and lead.\"\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe Tathāgata said: \"There is but one true matter. The other two are not the path of the golden elixir.\" Apart from mercury and lead, there is no other esoteric method.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nGao Xiangxian day and night sought the truth, until unknowingly his soul ascended to the Jade Capital. The Emperor then commanded the Lady of the Western Flower and Grand Unity to instruct him in the secret of the golden elixir. In her text, she said: \"Qian and Kun are the gates of yin and yang.\"",

      "translated_text": "Qian’s Way is male, Kun’s Way is female.\nThe people of this age know not true yin and yang,\nVainly searching heaven and earth for dragon and tiger.\n\nIt is also said:\nShu Tong took up the task, Wei Boyang led the way,\nLaughing as they entered the land of Nothing-Whatsoever.\nOnly then did *Lianshan* compose the *Cantong Qi*,\nLeft as the king of elixir scriptures for ten thousand ages.\nThe Perfected One spoke much,\nYet it all comes down to refining lead and controlling mercury.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nOne who is devoted to the Dao is a person of divine transcendence.\nEven in the space between a single breath and a single sleep,\nThey never for a moment forget,\nThus in dreams they constantly commune with perfected immortals and sagely saints.\nWhy is this?\nHeaven is without private favor, yet aids those who possess virtue.\nThe Dao arises from emptiness and nothingness to generate the One Qi,\nAnd from this One Qi, yin and yang are produced.\nYin and yang unite again to give rise to the Three Bodies,\nAnd from the Three Bodies, the ten thousand things flourish.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe Dao is fundamentally empty, yet gives form to qi.\nQi is fundamentally substantial, yet takes on formless form.\nWhen emptiness and fullness restrain each other, the One is born.\nThe One generates the Two, the Two generate the Three,\nAnd the Three generate the ten thousand things.\nThe ten thousand things all bear yin and embrace yang,\nHarmonizing through the primal qi.\nBefore form arises, the harmonious qi of the primal void cannot be seen.\nOnce emptiness takes shape, the clear qi becomes yang, the turbid qi becomes yin.\nThe two qi intermingle in misty union, their essences conjoined,\nAnd thus are born the Three Things: heaven, earth, and humanity.\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n\"Heaven and earth intermingle, and the ten thousand things are transformed into purity.\nMale and female unite their essences, and the ten thousand things are brought to life.\"\nThus the sage delves into the depths of this mystery to know its source,\nAnd exhausts its spirit to comprehend its transformations.\nTherefore, they can return to the root and revert to the origin,\nReversing and refining, inverting the workings of creation.\nThey plunder the mother qi of heaven and earth to forge the elixir,\nAnd steal the essence qi of yin and yang to serve as fire.\nThey refine form to return it to the One Qi,\nAnd refine qi to reenter the realm of emptiness and nothingness.\nThus body and Dao unite, subtly wondrous and perfectly penetrating,\nTransforming endlessly, now hidden, now manifest, beyond all reckoning—\nThis is called the Perfected Person.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe One generates the Two, the Two generate the Three,\nAnd the Three generate the ten thousand things—\nThis is the true body of the sacred embryo,\nThough a thousand or a hundred million, transformed without end.\nThus the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says:\n\"In one year, a child is born,\nAnd each one can ride a crane.\"\nThe *Mud-Pill Elder* says:\n\"In one year, a child is born of the embryo,\nAnd the child begets grandchildren, the grandchildren branch forth.\"\nAll elucidate the meaning of the Three generating the ten thousand things.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe Dao generates the One Qi, the One Qi generates form,\nAnd within form is contained the original qi—\nThis is the true primordial One Qi.\nWhen this primordial qi flows in accord, it becomes human;\nWhen it flows in reverse, it becomes the elixir.\nReversed, a man conceives the embryo;\nIn accord, a woman becomes pregnant.\nThis \"repeated generation\" refers specifically to cultivation:\nWhen the elixir is complete, the yang spirit emerges from the embryo,\nRecreating yin and yang—\nThis is what was meant above by \"the Three Bodies regenerate.\"\n\nWhen the thunder of Kan roars, the golden water flows just so,\nAnd fire erupts from Kunlun, yin and yang conjoined.\nIf these two things harmonize,\nThe elixir naturally ripens, and fragrance pervades the body.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe thunder of Kan is the bowstring qi of the tiger.\nThe tiger, with the fire within yin, illumines and melts the Qian dragon,\nAnd the dragon then emits the fire of Kunlun in response.\nWhen the fires of these two things merge and harmonize,\nThe essence of the true One naturally coagulates.\nAt that moment, gather and ingest it,\nAnd the hundred bones are all ordered, fragrant and beautiful.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe thunder of Kan is water and fire.\nMetal and water belong to the Kun direction.\nWhen water and fire clash in the Kun direction,\nGather the elixir to oneself—\nNaturally, the true One Qi pierces straight through the Niwan Palace,\nMerging with the yin qi within the body,\nAnd fragrance arises throughout.\nThe fragrance is the sign that the elixir is ripe.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe thunder of Kan is the moment when the other lead’s qi flourishes.\nI then seize the opportunity of its arrival,\nAnd emit the fire of Kunlun in response.\nThis is what is meant by \"in a month, there is but one day;\nin a day, there is but one

      "translated_text": "Do they not fear twisting their tongues to no purpose? Even with eloquence like a cascading river, it becomes but a demon obstructing the Way—all the more revealing their base and sordid learning. How then could they possess the eye of the great adept and bow to a teacher beneath the bonds of convention?\n\nThe Most High said: *\"The knower does not speak; the speaker does not know.\"*\n\nAfter obtaining the Elixir, my master, the Perfected Li of Great Emptiness, once heard a temple lecture on the sutras. Concealed among the crowd, he listened, then emerged and sighed: *\"What they speak of cannot be practiced; what we practice cannot be spoken.\"* The Immortal Elder pitied these disciples who harm themselves through profit.\n\nThus he said: *Cease empty talk of limited insight.*\n\nTake the true yang from the center of Kan’s position,\nAnd refine the yin within Li’s palace.\nFrom this, transform into the vigorous body of Qian,\nWhere hidden depths and soaring flight are all at will.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nLi has yang on the outside and yin within—it has an exterior but no interior.\nKan has yin on the outside and yang within—it has an interior but no exterior.\nUsing the inner yang to refine the inner yin yields pure Qian.\nThe Golden Elixir comes from without; it is the qi of utmost yang, called the Elixir, coalescing within the Northern Sea. By method, it is drawn forth to refine one’s own yin mercury, transmuting it into pure yang. Thereafter, the circulation of water and fire, the extraction and addition—all proceed at my command.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe yang within Kan is Qian. Qian moves and sinks into Kun, forming Kan, while Qian itself becomes Li. The method of cultivation lies in extracting that one yang from Kan and returning it to Li, restoring pure yang. Thus the method of refining the Elixir is complete.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nMaster Zhuang of Qiyuan said: The Cloud Generals of Primordial Chaos plotted to repay Hun Dun’s virtue. Each day, they bored one hole—on the seventh day, Hun Dun died. People of this world, born from a single drop of true yin and true yang from their parents, possess a body whole and undiminished. Yet by the age of sixteen, just as they have nurtured a body of pure yang, the Cloud Generals arrive: the Six Thieves assail from without, the Seven Emotions erode within. Unaware, when pure yang mingles with yin, the whole body is diminished, forming Li. When pure yin overwhelms yang, the single qi is seized, forming Kan. All ordinary people are thus exhausted. The great cultivator takes from Kan and returns to Li—this is the Way of the Golden Elixir.\n\nThe mercury of the Thunder Dragon emerges from Li’s land,\nThe lead of the Lake Tiger is born in Kan’s realm.\nThese two substances together beget mother from child;\nThe Five Phases must all enter the Central Palace.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nMercury is the Thunder Dragon, belonging to Wood. Wood generates Fire; Wood is Fire’s mother, Fire is Wood’s child—this is the ordinary sequence of the Five Phases. Yet cinnabar, belonging to Fire as Li, gives birth to mercury, meaning Fire inverts to generate Wood. Thus it is called \"child begetting mother.\" Lead is the Lake, belonging to Metal. Metal generates Water; Metal is Water’s mother, Water is Metal’s child—this is the ordinary sequence of the Five Phases. Yet black lead, belonging to Water as Kan, gives birth to lead, meaning Water inverts to generate Metal. Thus it is called \"elder begetting mother.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Great White said:\n*\"The art of inverting the Five Phases—\nThe dragon emerges from within Fire.\nNo need to traverse the Five Phases—\nThe tiger is born within Water.\"*\nThese two substances mutually generate, forming the Four Images.\nGathering at the Central Palace, uniting the Five Phases, the Elixir is congealed.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nIn general, this clarifies the Way of \"child begetting mother.\"\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nZhen is Qian’s eldest son, following his father’s will to practice the Way.\nDui is Kun’s youngest daughter, standing in her mother’s place to practice the Way.\nWhen Zhen and Dui unite, Tiger and Dragon descend;\nWhen Li and Kan merge, lead and mercury are born, and the Elixir is ingested into the Central Chamber of Spirit.\n\nThe moon, just half-bright after the sky clears,\nSoon bears the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl.\nNow is the time to cultivate the work of the two eights;\nWithin a single hour, the Elixir is complete.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe Immortal Elder’s reference to the half-moon merely illustrates the numbers of the two eights, likening them to Dragon and Tiger. The marvelous function of this Way lies within a single hour, divided into six intervals—yet the Golden Elixir is established in just two. The remaining four intervals hold other wondrous uses. These are all celestial mysteries, difficult to inscribe on bamboo and silk, transmitted only through oral instruction and heart-to-heart transmission.\n\nFools without a true teacher claim the medicine is completed in a single hour, not realizing it requires but a single hour. How utterly deluded! The common man, lost and without direction, privately conjectures—how grievously mistaken! To say it requires more than an hour is to extend it to days and months, yet this is the most wondrously simple and easy method.\n\nThis Way is not to be heard in the world of men; only those of great virtue and goodness may seek to inquire into it.\n\n*Jin’s note on* The Fire Record of the Great Elixir *says:*\nWhen the sage begins the work, at the inception of refining lead, he steals the qi of the Primordial One’s celestial cycle, seizing the correct tally of thirty million seventy-three thousand years. Gathering it within the cauldron of Qian and Kun, uniting it at the convergence of generation and destruction, he exhausts the tally of Heaven and Earth, the tally of sun and moon, the tally of Dragon and Tiger, the tally of yin and yang and the Five Phases, the tally of generation and completion. Capturing it all within a single hour, he forges a single grain of the Sacred Elixir, as large as a millet seed, weighing one pound—most numinous, most sacred, most honored, most noble. It is the primordial essence of Heaven and Earth, the master of the body’s destiny. Truly, it is to plunder Heaven and Earth, to steal yin and yang, to hold the cosmos in one’s hand, to give birth to the myriad transformations within the body. Attaining the rank of Perfected Immortal, one becomes a guest of the Emperor on High. Thus the Elixir’s completion in a single hour is its proof.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nWhen the medicine is born, it is like the moon emerging at geng and reaching ding—this is the qi-moment of half a catty of metal at the first quarter. At this time, yin and yang meet, easily uniting. By the fifteenth day, the Three Yangs are complete. When it reaches jia in the East, the moon has ascended as a full wheel, the qi-moment of two eights of Qian Metal.",

      "translated_text": "When scholars know this moment and cultivate accordingly, within this single hour the Golden Elixir may be accomplished.\n\n*Master Shangyang says:*\nAs the moon first appears at the horizon, it receives the sun’s faint yang—this is the moment when the tiger roars and *gui* is born, the primal beginning of precelestial qi. Seize the time when it comes; if the furnace is damaged, recovery is difficult.\n\nThe Old Immortal of Ziyang speaks with ever-greater urgency here, fearing that later generations may fail to attain immortality. Yet foolish and benighted men spend their days discoursing on the Dao, the blind leading the blind. They know not what is meant by the dragon’s chant or the tiger’s roar, nor that the work hinges on this single hour. Ignorant of all, they slander the Old Immortal’s words as “Three Peaks sexual arts,” and thus their sins only deepen.\n\nNow, what is this hour?\nAh! Seek not *zi* and *wu* at the far horizon—\nCount *kun* and *shen* first upon your own body.\nOn Mount Huayue’s peak the male tiger roars;\nIn Fusang’s depths the female dragon chants.\nThe Yellow Dame herself knows how to mediate,\nSending them forth as husband and wife with one heart.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nMount Huayue is the western mountain where the moon rises, symbolizing the tiger. The male tiger is the tiger’s first-quarter qi, yang within yin—hence “male tiger.” Fusang is where the sun rises, symbolizing the dragon. The female dragon is the dragon’s first-quarter qi, yin within yang—hence “female dragon.” Though these two are separated by east and west, the Yellow Dame enables their union as husband and wife, giving birth to the Yellow Sprout.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nWhen *kan* is above and *li* below, harmonized by the intent of central equilibrium, tiger and dragon love each other as husband and wife. “Yellow” signifies the center; “Dame” is the term for a woman’s elder years, thus free from jealousy and able to mediate. The meaning of the Yellow Dame is fully expressed in central harmony.\n\n*Master Shangyang says:*\nThe male tiger on the mountain’s peak is perilous and difficult to subdue; the female dragon in the sea’s depths is treacherous and difficult to tame. Without great power and great courage, how can one master them? Even the Golden Elixir is a supremely yang qi dwelling within the unfathomable and perilous—difficult to obtain, difficult to gather. Without accumulating thick virtue and refining the self to purity, how could one apply the work and attain it?\n\nNow, how can they be made to share one heart?\nAh! If you seek the treasure of heaven,\nYou must use the wealth of the world.\nThe White Tiger of the western mountain is wild and unruly;\nThe Azure Dragon of the eastern sea cannot be withstood.\nSeize them with both hands and make them fight to the death,\nTransforming into a lump of purple-gold frost.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nMaster Haichan said:\n“With the left hand seize the Azure Dragon’s head,\nWith the right hand grasp the White Tiger’s tail,\nBring them together and swallow them at once—\nHow sweet this thing is to contemplate.”\nThis speaks of external imagery. The foolish, having never heard the supreme Dao, take it to mean seizing the two beasts with both hands—yet this is not so.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nThe White Tiger of the western mountain is the metal essence within *kan*; the Azure Dragon of the eastern sea is the wood nature within *li*. These two are fierce and unruly, not easily captured. If one obtains the method to restrain them, they harmonize and transform into the Elixir. This “death” holds profound principle. As the diagnosis says: “To seek life’s wealth and nobility, one must apply the work of death.”\n\n*Master Shangyang says:*\nThe tiger has the potential to harm—one must consider how to subdue it. The dragon has the danger of fleeing—one must consider how to tame it. Now, how are they subdued and tamed? How do they fight to the death?\nHmph! Seal the three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth—do not let them communicate.\nThe Perfected One hides in the deep abyss,\nFloating and roaming, guarding the compass within.\nThe Red Dragon and Black Tiger, each to west and east,\nThe Four Images intersect at *wu* and *ji*.\nFrom this *fu* and *gou* can be employed,\nWho says the Golden Elixir cannot succeed?\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nWhen the Red Dragon and Black Tiger meet at *wu* and *ji*, they produce a grain of Elixir, which is returned to the Central Palace. Advance the yang fire in the *fu* hexagram, withdraw the yin water in the *gou* line, apply the work of drawing out and adding—thus the Golden Elixir is accomplished.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nDragon to the west, tiger to the east—thus they are separated. To make them meet, one must rely on *wu* and *ji*. Once they unite, they give birth to the purple-gold Elixir, and the fire is nurtured through the work of *fu* and *gou*.\n\n*Master Shangyang says:*\nMy teacher, Master Zhao, once saw a man who spent all day discoursing on the Dao, claiming to have met a master who had enlightened him. My teacher bowed before him and asked: “I dare not ask about the Dao—only, what are the dragon and tiger?”\nThe man said: “The dragon and tiger are within your own body.”\nMy teacher said: “What do they look like?”",

The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is secure, the state is at peace. The Sage takes the body as the state, essence as the people, fire as the minister, and the Elixir as the ruler.\n\nWe observe heaven with the heart, capture the Five Thieves and practice reversal, plunder yin and yang to set transformation in motion—then the true unity of essence may be seized, and the mercury of *qian* and the yin of *kun* are secured. When essence is firm and qi complete, one will surely triumph in battle and behold the Sage.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nHeaven is the heart. The Five Thieves are the five natures of the Five Phases within the heart. Each of the Five Phases possesses its own nature, and thus they mutually ravage one another—all original qi becomes plundered.\n\nMetal governs anger, wood governs joy, water governs coolness, fire governs heat, earth governs stillness—these are the natures of the Five Phases. One who can perceive these thieves will have a heart free of stray thoughts, a body like the Great Void.\n\nEarth refers to the entire body. The essence, qi, and spirit within the body are the people. When essence is whole and qi robust, this is called \"the people at peace.\" When the Four Great are healthy, this is called \"the nation prosperous.\" Only when the nation is prosperous may one engage in battle and achieve victory.\n\nIf this heart is overrun by wild thoughts and the root of this body is not firm, thieves will swarm like bees, essence will dissipate, and qi will scatter. To go into battle thus is to court destruction—how could one ever behold the Sage?\n\nThis chapter concerns the work of refining the heart, tempering the self, and laying the foundation.\n\n*Master Shangyang says:*\nThe Way of the Golden Elixir first requires tempering the self, so that spirit is whole and qi abundant, the Seven Emotions unmoved, the Five Thieves unchaotic, the Six Roots utterly purified, and essence unshakable—this is what is meant by \"thieves do not raid a poor household.\"\n\nIn the discourse on the Elixir Way, the Five Thieves are: the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and intent as the Five Thieves of heaven; form, sound, fragrance, flavor, and touch as the Five Thieves of the world; love, desire, greed, wrath, and delusion as the Five Thieves within.\n\nIf the Five Thieves of heaven are not guarded within, the Five Thieves within will swarm. If the Five Thieves of the world are not expelled without, the Five Thieves of heaven will multiply like jackals.\n\nThus, when the eye sees form, love arises and plunders essence. When the ear hears sound, desire arises and agitates essence. When the nose smells fragrance, greed arises and depletes essence. When the mouth tastes flavor, wrath arises and scatters essence. When the body and intent encounter touch, delusion arises and harms essence. These five, day and night, ravage the body—how much essence can remain? Once essence departs, spirit and qi follow in its loss.\n\nThe cultivator takes the body as the state and essence and qi as the people. When essence is unshaken, this is called \"the people at peace\"; when spirit and qi are abundant, this is called \"the nation prosperous.\" Seeking the Elixir is like waging war; the primordial unity of qi is the Sage.\n\nTo temper the self is to eliminate the harm of the Five Thieves, first guarding essence and nurturing qi—only then can one triumph in battle and attain the true unity of the primordial qi.\n\nThe Immortal Master uses battle as a metaphor to instill fear and caution. The foolish, failing to understand the harm of tempering the self and expelling thieves, misconstrue these references to seeking battle, employing generals, and underestimating the enemy as the doctrine of \"Three Peaks\" dual cultivation, leading to inextricable confusion.\n\nAh! The foolish remain foolish; the wise remain wise.\n\nWhen employing generals, distinguish between left and right armies. Though the other may be the host, I am the guest.\n\nI urge you: when facing battle, do not underestimate the enemy—lest you lose our priceless treasure.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe general is fire. The left is civil fire; the right is martial fire.\n\n\"Though the other may be the host\" means the host is yang and masculine, fond of contention, while the guest is yin and feminine, fond of stillness. For me to be the guest is to embrace the feminine without masculinity, to maintain stillness without contention—this is the mindset of caution, vigilance, and awe. The art of war says: \"Wait at ease for the weary; use stillness to control motion.\"\n\nThe application of the Way lies in fire; the application of fire lies in the person. First, set the water clock to distinguish *zi* and *wu*.",

      "translated_text": "Next, harmonize yin and yang to establish the foundation of transformation. Deploy the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin tally and drum the twenty-four qi’s yang fire. The Celestial Gate rests in the hand; the Earthly Axis turns from the heart. Revolve the seventy-two seasonal nodes’ crucial ford, gathering them into the crucible. Seize the three hundred sixty days’ upright qi, converging it within the embryo. Apply the method with precision; withdraw and replenish in proper sequence. When in motion, guard against peril and contemplate danger—dare not deviate by even a hair’s breadth. Externally, align with yin and yang’s tally; internally, generate the True One’s body. Should one’s mind stray in carelessness or the seasonal nodes diverge, the Alchemical Maiden may flee, the numinous embryo fail to coalesce, and the priceless treasure of the Returned Elixir be lost—just as facing battle without embracing the feminine and underestimating the enemy.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nUsing the military general as analogy: weapons are instruments of harm, yet skillfully employed, they may preserve life. To treat battle lightly or dismiss the enemy ensures defeat and ruin. When gathering the medicine, divide into left and right armies as with the enemy and oneself. I am the left army; the other, the right. Move with circumspection, reverence, and solemnity—allow not even the slightest breach of discipline, that the treasure may be preserved whole.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nThe left is the self; the right, the other. \"Though the other may be the host, I am the guest\" means the other stands above while I remain below, the other seeks motion while I seek stillness. The immortals’ masters speak of elixir-seeking through military analogy: a single moment’s carelessness invites defeat—how could one treat it lightly? The Ninefold Return of the Golden Elixir transpires within half a *shi*, as creation’s forces contend and tiger and dragon wage war. Seize the creative power of Heaven and Earth’s dominion, seize the creative power of the undivided Supreme Polarity, seize the creative power of Qian and Kun’s union, seize the creative power of yin and yang’s unfathomable interplay, seize the creative power of water and fire’s balanced harmony, seize the creative power of the Five Phases’ mutual conquest, seize the creative power of the myriad things’ generation—all converging in an instant to seek the one primordial qi and refine it into the Elixir. How could one not proceed with utmost caution? Thus this chapter specifically illustrates the outer elixir’s symbolic resonance. Should one attain the outer elixir, the immortal’s work is complete—this is the warning against underestimating the enemy in battle. For the cultivator, to accomplish this single feat is to declare the task arduous. The Returned Elixir is indeed the most difficult of all, as the Tathāgata said: \"The World-Honored One speaks of this difficulty—it is most difficult indeed.\" Should one slight the enemy even slightly, failing to guard against the seven emotions or six thieves, the radiant and most refined treasure of the self will be lost—how could one dare underestimate?\n\nFire is born of wood, its edge concealed;\nWithout skill in drilling, force not the attack.\nDisaster arises from this self-harm—\nSeek the Metal Lord to subdue it.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nFire born of wood brings calamity when unleashed. Essence born of the body, when stirred, must leak. Without skill in drilling, disaster harms the self.\n\n*Lü the Realized says:*\nFire erupts from seven gates—secure them tightly,\nLest it burn through the River Chariot’s path.\nThis is why one must seek the Metal Lord to subdue it.\n\n*Ziye says:*\nWithin wood lies fire, inherently bearing this destructive force. Should it erupt, the wood must burn. The pivot of life and death hangs by a thread. The common folk, ignorant of this, drift into dissipation and perversion. The sage, perceiving fire’s imminent eruption, restrains it with water—thus fire cannot cause harm.\n\n*Shangyangzi says:*\nWood symbolizes this body, which grows day and night, and the essence-qi returns to it. In the prime of life, one’s essence-qi flourishes, and the calamity of desire arrives—impossible to subdue. To subdue it, one must first obtain primordial true lead. Yet without a true master’s guidance on the authentic lead’s source and sequence, do not act rashly.\n\nThe Metal Lord is originally the Eastern House’s child,\nSent to the Western Neighbor to lodge and grow.\nRecognize and summon him home to nurture—\nPair him with the Alchemical Maiden as kin.\n\n*Daoguang says:*\nThe Golden Elixir’s workings manifest in myriad symbolic resonances: yang within yin that reverts to yang and then yin again, yin within yang that reverts to yin and then yang again. There are inner and outer medicines’ yin and yang, inner and outer three natures, inner and outer Five Phases and four images. There is also the interplay of inner and outer yin and yang.

      "translated_text": "Ziye says: This chapter shares the same essential meaning as the earlier one on drawing forth the true essence from the Kan position.\n\nShangyangzi says: Zhen is the Eastern House, Dui is the West. To seek the Dui position, do not stray from *ren*. Only thus is true recognition and return achieved—yet do not treat the summoning lightly. Once summoned, the most critical step is the return to the dwelling. Alas, every stage is a matter of utmost difficulty; how dare one act recklessly, or speak carelessly?\n\nThere exists in the world a breed of hell-bound seeds who, the moment they open their mouths, prattle of Chan and Dao, deceiving others until death without ever repenting—how could they possibly grasp the words of Chan Master Yuanwu? Yuanwu says:\n\n*If the soles of your feet are not vast, your Chan—though Chanless—is true Chan, like a hare with child. If the crown of your head shines with fivefold radiance, your Dao—though Daoless—is true Dao, like a clam holding the bright moon.*\n\nIs this not the very wonder of recognizing, summoning, and returning home?\n\n*The Alchemical Maiden wanders with her own direction—\nThe forward path must be short, the return long.\nWhen she comes back, she enters the Yellow Dame’s dwelling,\nTo wed the Golden Elder as her old lord.*\n\nDaoguang says: The Alchemical Maiden is mercury. Her wandering with direction pertains to the workings of the outer medicine. At the outset of elixir refinement, when the mercury fire is moved for less than half a watch, true essence is obtained and consumed—this is the forward path that must be short. After ingesting the elixir, when one moves the fire of one’s own mercury, there follows the labor of ten months—this is the return that must be long. The Yellow Dame is the inner image, the earthen crucible. The Golden You is true lead; the Old Lord is pure yang.\n\nZiye says: The Alchemical Maiden is one’s own yin mercury. She moves forward in sequence, then returns in reversal. Moving forward, she is submerged in the other in the space of a moment; returning in reversal, she flows upward from below, circulating through the entire body, descending into the Central Palace to unite with lead and form the sacred embryo.\n\nShangyangzi says: The Alchemical Maiden is one’s own essence. Her wandering with direction refers to the well-trodden path of essence’s movement. In ordinary people, essence is often deficient; whenever arousal occurs, it agitates the bones and marrow of the entire body, stirring the very essence within. As desire stirs, the Heart Monarch is also led astray; the Three Corpses surge above, the Seven Po drive below. Only then does essence ascend from the two meridians, rise through the five viscera to the Mud Pill Palace, descend with the marrow, pass through the twin passes of the spine to the outer kidneys, and engage in union—this is the method of the Five Turbidities world, the wandering with direction of the common Dao, the forward movement of the ordinary path.\n\nThe Golden Elixir is not so. It follows the method of inversion, the Way of reversal. The great practitioner, having refined the self to purity, remains unmoved in body and mind; the hun and po are subdued, desire does not intrude, and essence and qi are full and abundant—like a suddenly wealthy household, where gold and jade are found everywhere. When that first yang stirs, and primordial true lead arrives, the essence and qi of one’s entire body remain still. One merely moves a single point of true lead from the nearest place below the inner kidneys to meet it—this is the forward path that must be short. Once true lead has crossed the Magpie Bridge to unite, it ascends with the winch of the Three Carts, passing through the twin passes of the spine to enter the Mud Pill Palace, suffusing the Nine Palaces, filling the two eyes, descending the Golden Bridge, passing through the Double Towers, and entering the Crimson Palace for refinement. This is the wandering with direction, the return that must be long. Then, returning to the Yellow Court’s divine chamber, it conjoins to form the elixir—this is entering the Yellow Dame’s dwelling to wed the Golden Elder, the inversion of the Five Phases and the reversal of cultivation.\n\nAfter ten months of gentle nurturing, the true person is perfected, attaining a lifespan equal to heaven—this is the Old Lord. The immortal masters have explained the sequence so clearly; the annotations of other schools are all cursory and vague, for they dared not reveal the secrets. I wish for all people in the world, for the countless millions of future generations, to achieve immortality and Buddhahood by this means—I am willing to bear the blame for this revelation. May the true immortal sages above and the gods and spirits of heaven and earth bear witness.\n\n*Though you may know cinnabar and black lead,\nWithout the firing times, it is all in vain.\nIt all depends on the power of cultivation—\nA hair’s breadth off, and no elixir is made.*\n\nDaoguang says: In the creation of the Golden Elixir, a hair’s breadth of error leads one a thousand miles astray. The sages transmit the medicine but not the fire; the firing times have always been known by few.\n\nZiye says: Even if you recognize true lead and true mercury, without the firing times, the sacred embryo will not form. Why? Because the nature of fire is warmth, and it alone can fuse the true substances, enabling their union. Without fire, lead remains lead, mercury remains mercury—each stays apart.\n\nShangyangzi says: The cauldron, the medicine—these the immortal masters have revealed completely in their poems. Only the firing times are not committed to writing, for they must be transmitted orally by a master. Without the master’s oral instruction, even if one knows the medicine, the elixir will not be achieved. Moreover, the firing times proceed through several stages in sequence—how could a fool’s wild guesses comprehend them?\n\n*The *Cantong Qi* discusses the true elixir,\nBut does not set the firing times in writing.\nTo know the wondrous subtleties of the oral instructions,\nYou must discuss them in detail with an immortal.*\n\nDaoguang says: The *Fire Records* contain six hundred chapters, each resembling the others, in harmony with heaven’s measure. What heaven conceals, the sages do not transmit. If you encounter a true master, investigate thoroughly.\n\nZiye says: The firing times are crucial to the elixir—without a master, do not guess recklessly.\n\nShangyangzi says: There are outer firing times and inner firing times. The ancient immortals and sages wrote ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures, yet none pointed to the firing times—daring not leak the heavenly treasure. Now I reveal the inner and outer firing times, wishing that later learners may all become immortals.\n\nMaster Boyang says: *\"On the third day, the moon emerges at geng.\"* This refers to the outer firing times. Master Cui says: *\"Heaven responds to the stars, earth to the tides.\"* These are the outer firing times. Master Chunyang says:\n\n*When the first yang stirs,\nAt midnight when the clepsydra runs long,\nThe lead crucible warms gently,\nIts light piercing the curtains.*",

      "translated_text": "The above are the outer firing times. Such expressions seem clear and explicit.\n\nGuangchengzi says:\n*\"Abandon the toil of the elixir furnace and river chariot,\nThe crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath flow on of themselves.\"*\nThese are the inner firing times.\n\nThe Immortal Master’s poem says:\n*\"Do not vainly guard the medicine furnace to watch the firing times,\nBut let the spirit’s breath follow nature.\"*\nThese are the inner firing times.\n\nBefore refining the elixir, the most difficult to obtain is the outer firing times—this is the work of deliberate effort and foundational practice. The inner firing times, however, come after the elixir is obtained, simply following nature’s spontaneity. This is the great rest, the effortless achievement of non-action.\n\n*\"On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—\nJust when the golden essence is at its peak.\nWhen the first yang stirs,\nHasten to advance the fire without delay.\"*\n\nDaoguang says: On the fifteenth of the eighth month, the qi of Metal and Water is abundant, and the first yang begins to rise again. This is the Zi hour of heaven, when both inner and outer firing work should be swiftly advanced.\n\nZiye says: The golden essence is at its peak like the moon on the fifteenth night of the eighth month. The moon is Metal, and Metal flourishes in You. The eighth month corresponds to You, so this metaphor teaches that one should advance the fire at this time, not waiting until it waxes too full and then wanes.\n\nShangyangzi says: When Water is clear and Metal flourishes, the toad and moon in the sky shine brightly. When lead encounters the birth of Gui, the medicine in the human realm may be refined. Just as the first yang stirs, do not delay—lest the lead crucible gradually wane and one’s spiritual efforts be spent in vain. The Immortal Master’s poem here speaks of the outer firing times in this way.\n\n*\"When the first yang stirs at the time of elixir-making,\nThe lead crucible warms gently, its light piercing the curtains.\nAt the moment of receiving qi, it is easily obtained,\nBut in withdrawal and replenishment, beware of danger.\"*\n\nDaoguang says: At the Zi hour of the first yang, within the elixir crucible, true lead receives the fire, and its light pierces the curtains. Once the elixir is within for ten months, in the work of withdrawal and replenishment, one must guard against danger.\n\nZiye says: The learner should seize the moment when the first yang stirs to make the elixir. When the lead crucible’s light arises, true qi is easily obtained. Yet when it retreats into concealment, one must be especially cautious in withdrawal and replenishment.\n\nShangyangzi says: Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *\"Receiving qi is auspicious; guard against it becoming inauspicious.\"* The meaning is the same.\n\n*\"The mysterious pearl takes form and follows the bowels to grow,\nAs yang reaches its peak, yin arrives and gradually strips away its form.\nWhen the frost flies in the tenth month, the elixir is finally ripe—\nEven gods and ghosts must stand in awe.\"*\n\nDaoguang says: \"Taking form\" means that at the winter solstice, one follows the growth of yang to advance the yang fire, and at the summer solstice, retreats with the yin tally. By the tenth month, when stripping is complete, the returned elixir is finally ripe.\n\nZiye says: The \"mysterious pearl\" is the image of the medicine. The medicine cannot generate itself but must respond to the yang qi to arise. From the subtle to the manifest, as yang reaches its peak, yin recedes. When the ten-month cycle is complete, the great elixir is accomplished.\n\nShangyangzi says: This speaks of the inner elixir’s symbolic process, the work of withdrawal, replenishment, and gentle nurturing. The *Essentials of the Golden Elixir* describes the work of withdrawal, replenishment, and gentle nurturing in great detail.\n\n*\"After the first quarter and before the last,\nThe medicine is balanced, its qi and image complete.\nGather it and return to the furnace to refine,\nRefining through gentle nurturing, it cooks of itself.\"*\n\nDaoguang says: By the thirtieth day of the month, the yang soul of Metal is entirely dispersed, and the yin essence of Water fills the wheel—thus it is pure yin. Without light, it resembles Kun, hence called \"dark.\" On the two days of darkness and new moon, the sun and moon conjoin, rising and setting together. By the second day, the moon is impregnated by the sun’s light. On the third, a single yang appears at the Kun direction Geng—within the po, the hun is born, resembling Zhen. At this time, the golden qi in the human body first stirs, and the medicine’s sprout is new. On the eighth day, the second yang arises, resembling Dui. At this time, the po contains half the hun, and it is level as a string—hence called the \"first quarter.\" The period before the quarter belongs to yang, and after to yin. Within yin, yang is half—one obtains eight taels of Metal within Water, its flavor balanced, its qi and image complete. On the fifteenth day, the three yangs are complete, resembling Qian. At this time, the yin essence of po is entirely consumed, and the yang soul of hun fills the wheel—thus it is perfectly round, pure yang without yin, hence called the \"full moon.\" When yang reaches its peak, yin is born. On the sixteenth day, a single yin arises within the wheel, and within the hun, the po is born—resembling Xun. On the twenty-third day, the second yin arises, resembling Gen. At this time, the hun contains half the po, and it is also level as a string—hence called the \"last quarter.\" The period before the quarter belongs to yin, and after to yang. Within yang, yin is half—one obtains half a catty of Water within Metal, its flavor balanced, its qi and image complete. The sage gathers these two eights, seizing them within the furnace of creation, refining and nurturing gently to complete the returned elixir. The Immortal’s verse here repeatedly exhorts, ensuring one’s single-minded focus. The \"cooking\" indeed holds a wondrous meaning.\n\nZiye says: After the first quarter and before the last, following the union of sun and moon, when the great yin is about to be reborn, the medicine’s material is fresh, possessing its balanced flavor. One must swiftly gather it, congealing it with the yin mercury within the body. Beginning with gentle nurturing and ending with cooking, when this elixir is ripe, it will naturally become clear.\n\nShangyangzi says: The Immortal Master’s poem intends to show that when the medicine arises at the time of the first yang’s stirring, one should refine it, just as the great yin receives the newly born qi to complete the golden elixir. Xue and Lu’s annotations agree; those who take the first quarter as the upper quarter and the last quarter as the lower quarter are mistaken.\n\n*End of the Third Scroll of the Third Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang*\n\n*Beginning of the Fourth Scroll of the Third Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang*",

      "translated_text": "Master Shangyang says: Punishment is destruction, virtue is achievement. Punishment is peril, virtue is nurturance. Once golden sand resides in the crucible, it must be warmed, nourished, and sustained. Even the Perfected One of Purple Clarity lamented the smoke filling the cavernous chamber—how could one not be cautious?\n\nSun and moon meet once every thirty days; the method of exchanging days for hours governs the divine work. Whether guarding the city or waging wild battle, one discerns fortune and misfortune—adding to the numinous sand until the crucible brims with crimson.\n\nDaoguang says: The Great Yang and Great Yin conjoin once a month. The sages modeled this, condensing a day into an hour, exchanging months for days and days for hours. When guarding the city, one bathes and ceases the work; in wild battle, tiger and dragon mate. The divine work refers to the measure of advancing fire. If yin and yang are disordered, sun and moon discordant, though the external fire moves, the internal tally does not respond. The secret essentials of advancing fire and retreating water—knowing fortune and misfortune—revolve the Dipper and traverse the Winnowing Basket, covertly aligning with celestial degrees. Naturally, the numinous embryo forms in secret, and the divine crucible gains radiance.\n\nZiye says: The Great Yin and Great Yang unite once a month. The method of refinement exchanges hours for days, and when *li* and *kan* merge, it is the moment of darkness ending and the new moon’s medicine arising—no ordinary time. Master Shangyang says: In a year, the moon waxes twelve times, clearly marking the days of yang’s birth. In a month, day and night span three thousand *ke*—in every *ke*, seek the hour of *gui*’s generation. In wild battle, one gathers lead; when guarding the city, only warm and nurture. To know fortune and misfortune is to ensure success.\n\nWhen *pi* and *tai* just meet, the myriad things flourish; when *zhun* and *meng* receive their hexagrams, they are endowed with generation and completion. In this, grasp the meaning and cease seeking images—if you exhaust the lines, you will vainly labor the mind.\n\nDaoguang says: The winter and summer solstices are the origins of one yin and one yang. The *zi* and *wu* hours are the beginnings of one day and one night. The sages moved the tally and fire of yin and yang, harmonizing with the Dao of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, the principle of sun and moon’s coming and going. Gathering the four seasons, eight nodes, twenty-four qi, and seventy-two *hou*, they arrayed them within the crucible to generate the body of True Unity. Thus, they entrusted it to hexagram images, dividing the work across the three decades of a month to unfold the mystery and clarify the fire phases. To cling to and employ the lines and images is mistaken.\n\nYet *zhun* and *meng* are the first of all hexagrams, symbolizing the beginning of action and generation, the origin of endowment and transformation. Thus, at dawn, *zhun*; at dusk, *meng*. When *pi* and *tai* operate, yang ascends and yin descends. At the spring equinox, yang qi ascends to the center of heaven and earth, yin and yang equally balanced, forming the *tai* hexagram—like the moon’s first quarter and its qi phase. At this time, yin and yang naturally merge; not advancing the fire phase is called bathing. At the autumn equinox, yin qi descends to the center of heaven and earth, yin and yang equally balanced, forming the *pi* hexagram—like the moon’s last quarter and its qi phase. At this time, yin and yang naturally conjoin; not advancing the fire phase is called bathing. Such is the method and image—why labor over hexagram lines?\n\nZiye says: When yin and yang unite, the myriad things are born. Born without end, what enables their union is the fire phase. Dawn *zhun* and dusk *meng* are the guiding principles of applying fire. If scholars understand this, the remaining hexagram images will follow naturally.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: Before heaven and earth communicate, it is *pi*; when yin and yang have merged, it is *tai*. *Zhun* receives the beginning of generation and completion; *meng* receives the work of nurturing and rearing. This speaks of the inner elixir’s Dao.\n\nHexagrams set forth images to model forms; grasp the image, forget the words, and the meaning becomes clear. Later generations, deluded, cling only to images, practicing hexagram qi in hopes of ascending—how lamentable.\n\nDaoguang says: Hexagrams are the snares and traps of fire. Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi*, expounding the *Yijing*’s images to illuminate the elixir’s Dao, likening *qian* and *kun* to the crucible and vessel, *kan* and *li* to the medicinal substances. Thus, the four hexagrams reside in the central palace, not bound to the revolving hub’s numbers. The sixty hexagrams are distributed across a month, moving the tally and fire, beginning with *zhun* and *meng*, ending with *jiji* and *weiji*, cycling endlessly like a wheel, turning without cease. Each day governs two hexagrams, thirty days for sixty hexagrams. Together with the four hexagrams *qian*, *kun*, *kan*, and *li*, they total sixty-four, with three hundred eighty-four lines, modeling a year and its intercalary month. The remaining three hundred eighty-four days mirror the weight of two times eight *jin* of golden elixir—one *jin* calculated as three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. All these are metaphors and images. If the fire phases are understood, hexagrams and lines become superfluous. Scholars who instead cling to these and practice hexagram qi, exhausting their bodies and minds in hopes of ascending—is this not pitiful?\n\nZiye says: The former masters borrowed the *Yijing*’s yin and yang as metaphors, merely to enact one’s own transformation. Those who cling to images and rigidly follow texts, seeking steeds by tracing pictures, are far from the Dao.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: The elixir’s Dao likens *qian* and *kun* to the crucible and vessel to make known the male and female. It likens dragon and tiger to *kan* and *li* as medicinal substances, thereby revealing that lead and mercury are the products of tiger and dragon. People fixate on the *Yijing*’s words but do not understand the hexagrams’ use. If they understood the hexagrams’ use, they would not grasp the *Yijing*’s Dao.",

      "translated_text": "To understand the Dao of the *Yijing* lies within the body, not in hexagram qi.\n\nHeaven and Earth wax and wane in their own time—only by discerning their ebb and flow can one grasp the mechanism. Since ancient times, the *geng* and *jia* have proclaimed the decree; when the Three Worms are slain, the Dao may be attained.\n\nDaoguang says: Heaven and Earth are separated by eighty-four thousand *li*. At the winter solstice, yang qi rises from within the Earth, ascending four hundred sixty *li* and two hundred forty *bu* in a single day. Five days make one *hou*, three *hou* make one *qi*, three *qi* make one *jie*, and three *jie* make one season—this is the spring equinox. Over ninety days, yang qi ascends a total of forty-two thousand *li*, reaching the exact midpoint between Heaven and Earth. At this time, yang within yin is half-complete, corresponding to the *Tai* hexagram. Its qi transforms from cold to warm, the moment when the myriad things arise.\n\nFrom this point onward, yang qi ascends into the yang position, reaching the summer solstice after a total of one hundred eighty-four days, having ascended eighty-four thousand *li* in all. Now, yang within yang is complete, corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram, called \"pure yang.\" Its qi transforms from warm to hot, the time when the myriad things flourish and reach fullness—hence, \"fullness.\" When yang reaches its extreme, yin arises. After the summer solstice, yin qi descends from Heaven, falling four hundred sixty *li* and two hundred forty *bu* each day. By the autumn equinox, after ninety days, yin qi has descended forty-two thousand *li*, reaching the midpoint between Heaven and Earth. Now, yin within yang is half-complete, corresponding to the *Pi* hexagram. Its qi transforms from hot to cold, the time when the myriad things bear fruit.\n\nFrom this point onward, yin qi descends into the yin position, reaching the winter solstice after a total of one hundred eighty days, having descended eighty-four thousand *li* in all. Now, yin within yin is complete, corresponding to the *Kun* hexagram, called \"pure yin.\" Its qi transforms from cool to cold, the time when the myriad things withdraw and are stored away. Thus, the waxing and waning of Heaven and Earth are revealed through the moon.\n\nThe moon begins with the sun. On the third day, the *Zhen* trigram’s *geng* takes form; on the eighth day, the *Dui* trigram’s *ding* forms the crescent. On the fifteenth day, the *Qian* trigram’s *jia* reaches fullness—hence, \"fullness.\" On the sixteenth day, the *Xun* trigram’s *xin* assumes governance; on the twenty-third day, the *Gen* trigram’s *bing* forms the waning crescent. On the thirtieth day, the *Kun* trigram’s *yi* vanishes—hence, \"waning.\"\n\nThe sages discerned the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s waxing and waning, transposing a year’s qi and seasons into a single month. Thus, one day’s birth of yang is the winter solstice. Two and a half days correspond to one month’s qi, so that at the first quarter, yin within yang is half-complete—this is the spring equinox. By the fifteenth day, the qi of the fourth month is attained; the moon’s fullness is pure yang, and yang qi reaches its full wheel—hence, \"fullness.\" On the sixteenth day, one yin is born—this is the summer solstice. At the last quarter, yang within yin is half-complete—this is the autumn equinox. On the thirtieth day, the qi of the tenth month is attained; the moon’s darkness is the end of yin, and yin qi completes its wheel—hence, \"waning.\" Ending and beginning anew, it cycles without cease.\n\nThe sages moved the tally of yin and the fire of yang, following Heaven and Earth’s waxing and waning, ascent and descent, and cyclical return. The sixty-four hexagrams model the principle of *geng* and *jia*’s waxing and waning, just as a ruler proclaims decrees to slay the yin worms—only then may the Dao be attained.\n\nZiye says: When scholars perceive the principle of Heaven and Earth’s waxing and waning, they practice it within themselves, seizing the decree of *sheng geng* and *man jia*. After the new moon and before the full moon, they gather the qi of Heaven and Earth at its fullness, returning it to the body to refine and form the elixir. Then, how could the corpse-demons fail to be destroyed?\n\nShangyang says: The tide comes in full, the tide goes out empty—this is the waxing and waning of Heaven and Earth. The moon waxes full, the moon wanes empty—this is the waxing and waning of the sun and moon. Spring gives birth, summer grows, autumn gathers, winter stores—this is the waxing and waning of the four seasons. Qi flourishes and is full, qi scatters and is empty—this is the waxing and waning of the human body. *Gui* is born and is full, the full moon recedes and is empty—this is the waxing and waning of the golden elixir.\n\nMaster Changchun says: Like the qi of a bellows, when qi is full, it is strong; when qi is weak, it is empty. This waxing and waning of qi is most essential. If one can discern and employ it, at the outset of practice, one must first expel the Three Worms and Six Bandits, refining the heart until it is like the Great Void, purifying the six roots completely—only then may one enter the chamber to refine the Great Elixir.\n\nTo attain the Valley Spirit’s eternal life,\nOne must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation.\nWhen true essence returns to the Golden Chamber,\nA single pearl of numinous light will never depart.\n\nDaoguang says: That which is unfathomable in yin and yang is called \"spirit.\" Responsive and immediately penetrating, like an echo answering a sound—hence, \"Valley Spirit.\" Spirit is established through qi, and qi is born from essence. When essence is refined, it generates qi; qi generates spirit. Thus, spirit and qi are the masters of the body, and the body is the vessel of form and qi. Without spirit, form cannot endure; without qi, life cannot arise. Spirit and qi cannot stand without form—these two things depend on each other to give birth. If one seeks the foundation of long life, it rests entirely on the Mysterious Female. Once the Mysterious Female is established, then long life may be achieved.\n\nThe myriad things are born through this and die through this. It is truly the root of Heaven and Earth, the ancestor of the Five Phases, the origin of yin and yang, and the foundation of the ten thousand transformations. The sages relied on this to complete the outer elixir and borrowed it to accomplish the inner medicine. Thus, true essence returns to the Golden Chamber, transforming into a single pearl of numinous light, transmuting the body into qi, and qi into spirit. When form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth, hidden and manifest, unfathomable.\n\nZiye says: \"Valley\" means \"to nourish.\" The Mysterious Female is yin and yang. If one wishes to nourish the spirit and attain long life, one must achieve the harmony of yin and yang. Only then will the golden essence return to one’s Central Palace, like a single luminous pearl enduring forever.\n\nShangyang says: \"The Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.\"",
      "overlap_context": " texts, seeking steeds by tracing pictures, are far from the Dao.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: The elixir’s Dao likens *qian* and *kun* to the crucible and vessel to make known the male and female. It likens dragon and tiger to *kan* and *li* as medicinal substances, thereby revealing that lead and mercury are the products of tiger and dragon. People fixate on the *Yijing*’s words but do not understand the hexagrams’ use. If they understood the hexagrams’ use, they would not grasp the *Yijing*’s Dao.",

      "translated_text": "The Gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth. These are the words of Laozi, which the immortal masters later clarified for posterity to establish the foundation. The Mysterious Female is the gateway of ingress and egress within the human body, from which the Golden Elixir is refined and conjoined. Those who undertake great cultivation must first thoroughly comprehend the principle of the Mysterious Female—this is the place where yin and yang unite in essence—only then can one obtain the single luminous pearl of numinous light.\n\nThe Gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known to the world; some mistakenly point to the mouth and nose as its location. Even if you exhale and inhale for a thousand years, how could you ever achieve the union of the Golden Crow and the Jade Hare?\n\nDaoguang says: The Gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth. None in the world can comprehend this unless they encounter a true master to instruct them. Since the beginning of creation, without these two things of the Mysterious Female, how could the ten thousand things ever come to be? Both the inner and outer elixirs are established from this. The sages kept it secret, calling it the \"sun-suspended, moon-furnace, hanging embryo cauldron.\" The Golden Crow is the Golden Elixir. With this Golden Elixir, one can restrain one’s own yin mercury, like a cat seizing a rat or a hawk grasping a hare.\n\nSome say the Mysterious Female is the primordial cavity between the two kidneys—this is incorrect. The Mysterious Female consists of two things; without these two, how could the ten thousand things be transformed? How could one point to a single cavity in the ordinary body and generalize it thus? Those who take the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female are truly laughable.\n\nZiye says: The previous chapter only spoke of the two characters \"Mysterious Female,\" while this chapter further elucidates the character \"Gate,\" revealing its profound principle. The Gate is the place of ingress and egress, the site of yin-yang union. Without the true transmission passed down through heart and mouth, how could one presume to guess and know it?\n\nShangyang says: After Laozi pointed out the four characters \"Gate of the Mysterious Female,\" later true masters and immortals were able to proceed with refining the Great Elixir. Foolish people take the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female and regard breathing exercises as the Way. Such gross errors—how could they ever achieve the union of the Crow and Hare?\n\nDifferent names arise from the same source, yet few understand; these two mysteries hold the essential mechanism. Preserving life and perfecting form, clarifying gain and loss, the Purple Gold Elixir is most wondrous and rare.\n\nDaoguang says: The *Classic* states: \"Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Named, it is the mother of the ten thousand things.\" It also says: \"These two emerge together yet bear different names.\" When it is \"non-being,\" the true One qi is invisible, thus it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. When it is \"being,\" the true One pearl appears in the mysterious void, thus it is the mother of the ten thousand things. In Heaven, it is *li* as mercury; on Earth, it is *kan* as lead. Their essence is one, though their functions differ. Together they are called \"mysterious,\" mysterious upon mystery.\n\nThe superior person, the perfected one, grasps the mysterious mechanism of these two to clarify gain and loss, to govern the body. Then form can be preserved and life secured. What is called \"loss\" refers to the five phases proceeding in sequence, where the ordinary Way has arising and ceasing. What is called \"gain\" refers to the five phases reversing, where the elixir body remains eternally numinous and enduring.\n\nAlas! The Pure Yang Purple Gold stands at the beginning of Heaven and Earth, emerging as the mother of the ten thousand things—is this not the most wondrous of the Golden Elixir?\n\nZiye says: The One qi divides into yin and yang, hence the different names. Yet both arise from the Great Ultimate, thus it is said they emerge from the same source. Yin and yang are the essential mechanism of cultivation, preserving my life, perfecting my form, causing no loss to the other while benefiting myself. How marvelous—gold within water!\n\nShangyang says: \"Different names\" refer to being and non-being, subtlety and wonder, beginning and mother, mystery and female. This is the place of yin-yang union, the site where the Golden Elixir is transformed and born. Those of superior capacity must first awaken to these two, then they may refine the Purple Gold Elixir.\n\nBeginning with action, no one sees; only when it becomes non-action do the masses recognize it. They see only non-action as the essential wonder, yet how could they know that action is the root?\n\nDaoguang says: The trap and net are still in hand—no one understands me! Once ashore, the boat is no longer needed, yet ten eyes stare in bewilderment. Saints and commoners mingle in the marketplace, fish and dragons blend on the thoroughfare. How lamentable—people of the world pass by without recognition!\n\nZiye says: In gathering the medicine and circulating the fire, does one attain non-action? Knowing only non-action but not action—how can the elixir be congealed?\n\nShangyang says: If one reaches old age in non-action, how can the medicine be obtained? Entering the chamber to gather lead—this is called \"action.\" The great hermit dwells in the marketplace—who would notice? To establish the vast enclosure, first set up the boundary. Obtaining the single grain of millet pearl—this is not mistaken. Nine years of sitting in forgetfulness—non-action’s merit is vast. When the three thousand deeds are complete, one rejoices with the multitude.\n\nIf one only practices non-action without first engaging in action, this is the delusion of a foolish person clinging to attachment. These few earnest words are offered to instruct later learners.\n\nWithin black there is white—this is the mother of the elixir. Within the male, the female is concealed—this is the sacred embryo. The Great One in the furnace must be guarded with care; the Three Fields gather treasures, corresponding to the Three Terraces.\n\nDaoguang says: Extracting silver from lead—this is the mother of the elixir. Drawing mercury from cinnabar—this is the sacred embryo. The two things interact and transform, congealing in the furnace. With clarity of essence and timing of qi, strictly adhere to the method. Without the slightest deviation, the three natures unite, forming the elixir treasure, corresponding above to the Three Terraces.\n\nZiye says: White within black is the gold within water, the yang qi within *kan*. If one can gather this true yang qi and congeal it into an embryo—this is what is meant by \"within the male, the female is concealed.\" When gathering the medicine, one must keep the Great One as master in mind. If one is not careful in guarding it, human desires will overflow, and one’s treasure will be lost—would the master not find this strange?\n\nShangyang says: White within black is the yang within yin, the outer elixir’s symbol. The male harboring the female is the yang obtaining yin, the inner elixir’s symbol.",

Amidst the indistinct and vague, seek the tangible form; within the obscure and profound, find the true essence. From nothingness and being, they naturally merge—how could one conceive of its completion through mere thought?\n\nDaoguang says: True Yizi states: \"Nothingness is the dragon; being is the tiger. Nothingness is mercury; being is lead.\" Nothingness, stirred by being, takes form; being, moved by nothingness, gains spirit. Thus the millet grain in empty mystery shines with radiance like the dawn.\n\nZiye says: Those who refine the golden elixir must, within the obscure and indistinct, obtain its true essence and true form—only then is the task complete. Without transmission from a master, one cannot rely on clever conjecture.\n\nShangyang says: The Scripture states: \"Vague, yet within it there is something. Indistinct, yet within it there is form. Obscure, yet within it there is essence. Its essence is most true, and within it there is certainty.\" The Way of the golden elixir is fully contained in these words. The immortal master’s reiteration is most intimate and direct—without true oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction, how could one attain it through secretive sitting and visualization?\n\nWhen the Four Symbols unite, the mysterious body is formed;\nWhen the Five Phases are complete, purple gold shines bright.\nOnce the embryo is shed and enters the mouth, the whole body becomes sacred—\nCountless dragons and spirits are utterly astonished.\n\nDaoguang says: When the Four Symbols and Five Phases unite, the essence of the True One coalesces into a millet grain, radiant with purple light. Circulating it internally, when the embryo is shed and enters the mouth, one communes with heaven and earth—dragons and spirits are all struck with awe.\n\nZiye says: After ten months, the sacred embryo is fully formed, the entire body attains sacredness, and one connects with the divine—how could this not inspire awe?\n\nShangyang says: Once attained, it is eternally possessed; naturally, the body becomes light. At this point, when merit is complete and the elixir is efficacious, one is truly a great person.\n\nThe feast at the Flowery Pool concludes, the moon’s radiance clear;\nRiding a golden dragon, one visits the Purple Tenuity.\nFrom then on, after meeting the host of immortals,\nMountains and seas, hills and valleys shift at will.\n\nDaoguang says: When the feast at the Flowery Pool ends, the elixir is successfully refined, the embryo is shed, and the spirit transforms. The skin becomes as pure as ice and snow, graceful as one who rides the qi and mounts the clouds, roaming the eight directions, witnessing the world’s seas turn to mulberry fields.\n\nZiye says: The Flowery Pool is the place where the medicine is produced. When the feast concludes, the medicine is fully gathered, the sacred embryo is complete, and a body exists beyond the body. One pays homage at the origin and visits the imperial court, the immortal isles of Penglai—there is nowhere one cannot go.\n\nShangyang says: The Flowery Pool is the Winding River, the gate of the *kan* palace. The golden elixir is formed from this, and when merit is perfected here, one attains the rank of celestial immortal. This chapter is also the immortal master of Purple Yang’s self-eulogy, bequeathed to later generations. For the immortal master is one of the stars of the Purple Tenuity Heavenly Palace.\n\nTo know the method of the golden liquid returning elixir,\nOne must plant the seed in the home garden.\nNo need for blowing or straining—\nNaturally, the fruit ripens and the true embryo is shed.\n\nDaoguang says: This Way is very near, existing in one’s own home garden—one should hasten to cultivate it. If it is not of the same kind, it becomes ever more distant; if one obtains the same kind, what effort is required?\n\nZiye says: The medicine is gathered from another’s home but returned to one’s own garden to be cultivated until ripe—this is the wonder of nature, not the work of human effort.\n\nShangyang says: The method of the returning elixir exists in one’s own home garden. The golden flower’s seed can be cultivated on its own—no need for furnace or bellows. When the fruit ripens, the embryo is shed. Those beyond the world—monks in their round hats and patched robes—should know that the wonder of the home garden lies within the marketplace. Vimalakīrti, Fu Dashi, and others all obtained this garden to plant their seeds, which is why the Tathāgata named it the Garden of Solitary Joy.\n\nDo not apply clever deceit as effort;\nRecognize the deathless method from another’s home.\nIn the pot, constantly replenish the wine of life;\nIn the tripod, gather the returning soul’s nectar.\n\nDaoguang says: Those who cultivate the truth often cling to false and clever methods, applying effort to themselves—how could they achieve success? If one awakens to the deathless medicine in another’s home and adds the fire of returning life within the abdomen, this is the true treasure.\n\nZiye says: This Way is the reversal of true yang, stealing the life within the mechanism of killing. It is not the three-peak sexual arts or other clever deceits and drifting techniques. Wine and nectar are both divine water.\n\nShangyang says: Previously, it spoke of planting in the home garden; now it speaks of the deathless method from another’s home—are these not two different things? The wine of extended life and the nectar of returning soul are both true essence and true qi. The Scripture states: \"Immortals and Daoists can accumulate spirit and amass qi, making them truly real.\"\n\nA fine brew from the snowy mountain,\nPoured into the Dongyang crucible of creation.\nIf it passes northwest beyond Kunlun,\nOnly Zhang Qian will see Lady Ma.\n\nDaoguang says: The snowy mountain symbolizes whiteness; the western mountain is the image of metal. It compares the golden elixir—a single grain, its taste like ghee—ingested into the crucible of creation in the cinnabar field. Kunlun lies within the sea; the Kunlun of our body originally resides in the lower sea of water, where the form resembling Kunlun arises—the place where fire is generated. At the summit of Kunlun is a gate called the Mysterious Gate, also known as the Heavenly Gate in the northwest *qian* position. Zhang Qian symbolizes the *qian* hexagram, its line image true mercury, representing yin fire. Lady Ma symbolizes the *kun* hexagram, its line image true lead, representing yang fire. When fire is emitted from the Mysterious Gate of Kunlun and enters, only then does the true lead within the tripod appear and undergo transformation. As the true embryo melts within and true fire connects without, the *kun* trigram transforms into the *qian* trigram, yin water returns to yang tally. South fire communicates, lead and mercury unite—the root of the immortal’s Way lies herein.\n\nZhang Qian rides the raft to the Moon Palace,\nEncountering the Woman constellation—\nThis illustrates the meaning of yin and yang meeting.",

Then, circulate it from the *weilü* through the *niwan*, descending from the abdomen to the *dantian*, where it merges with the yin mercury within the body to become one.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Snow Mountain is the land of utmost yin, yet within yin resides yang—hence the saying, \"the finest *tihu* pours upon the crown.\" That which is poured in then reverses to reside above. I belong to the east, thus called Eastern Yang. My Mysterious Gate is named the Furnace of Creation. The Kunlun and Zhang Qian’s Dao-light have already been explained. The Buddha’s past practice on Snow Mountain refers precisely to this. The ancients named it after its place, often borrowing names to represent things.\n\nThose who fail to recognize yang essence and the host-guest relationship—how can they discern intimacy from estrangement? Closing the *weilü* cavity in vain during bedroom arts has misled countless souls in Jambudvīpa.\n\nDaoguang said: Master Zhongli once stated: \"The four great elements of the body all belong to yin—what, then, is yang essence?\" The true one’s essence is the qi of utmost yang, called Yang Elixir, which comes from without to govern one’s yin mercury—thus serving as the host. When the two long for each other, they congeal into golden sand, naturally unyielding, and so the Returned Elixir is formed. Deluded disciples, failing to grasp this principle, instead practice bedroom arts of controlling women, forcibly closing the *weilü*, calling it \"refining yin\" to prolong life—this is truly carrying firewood to extinguish a fire. As the *Yinfu Jing* says: \"Fire is born from wood, and calamity inevitably follows.\" How can one not be cautious?\n\nZiye said: Yang essence is indeed the metal within *kan*. Though it comes from without, it is originally a substance within the body—only a hair’s breadth separates their shared origin from differing names.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Though yang essence is obtained through the bedroom, it is not the art of controlling women. Practicing such arts is a deviant path—how can it lead to longevity? Thus the Buddha said: \"Those who walk the deviant path cannot see the Tathāgata.\" Without a true master to point out the path of yang essence, all side doors become deviant paths. The blind masters of the world pass down the monstrous techniques of \"three-peak yin absorption\" and \"controlling women,\"所谓 \"the blind leading the blind.\" When the night of the thirtieth of the twelfth month arrives, they instead blame the alchemical classics for deception, never reflecting on their own errors. Thus the immortal elder reveals this poem:\n\nAll things in profusion return to their roots,\nReturning to the root and reviving the mandate ensures eternal abiding.\nThose who know constancy and return to the origin are rarely understood,\nWhile reckless actions summon misfortune—all have heard of this.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao Guang says: The scripture states, \"The myriad things flourish abundantly, each returning to its root.\" Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called reviving the mandate. Reviving the mandate is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Before a person is born, they dwell in profound unknowing, merged with primordial simplicity. When they are born, they receive the endowment of yin and yang from their parents. The sage reverses this process and cultivates it, seizing the qi of prior heaven to form the \"elixir mother.\" They plunder the initial qi of yin and yang to establish the foundation of transformation. Refining the form, they return to formlessness; refining the qi, they revert to primordial simplicity. Those who know the constant Dao and return to this knowing are sages. Thus, those who attain longevity yet do not know the constant Dao and act recklessly are the deluded masses, and so they summon misfortune.\n\nZi Ye says: Even things like grasses and trees can return to their roots and revert to their origin, enduring through the years. Humans, the most spiritually endowed of all beings, move toward death yet cannot match the grasses and trees. This Dao is the way of returning to the root and reverting to the origin—it is not the reckless path that invites misfortune.\n\nShang Yang Zi says: All things have their time of returning to the root. The perfected person understands the principle of longevity. When grasses and trees encounter the extreme of yin, they return to their roots and await spring to flourish again. When a person’s qi and blood are about to decline, they must seek the way of returning to the root, which can restore youth, revert to infancy, and ensure longevity. Alas! Returning to the root is the returning elixir. \"Constant\" refers to the worldly laws of ordinary existence. Only by thoroughly mastering these worldly laws in profound secrecy can one revert to the origin and return to the primordial—this is knowing constancy. Thus, those who \"greatly conceal themselves in the marketplace\" do so to remain unrecognized. If even the slightest matter is not kept secret and one acts recklessly, they will invite misfortune and slander. Therefore, Bodhidharma came from afar to the eastern land seeking to accomplish Buddhahood, desiring to avoid misfortune and escape slander. The Sixth Chan Master concealed himself among hunters in Sihui for the same reason—to avoid misfortune and attain Buddhahood. Later, when Dao Guang Chan Master received the transmission from Stone Immortal, he had no choice but to return to lay life, relying on the powerful to complete this endeavor. Our Chongyang Emperor Lord dwelled in the \"Tomb of the Living Dead\" to attain the Dao. The Supreme Void Immortal went to the Wuyi Mountains for seven months. The Longevity Immortal Lord went to Luoyang for three years. The ancients toiled and struggled solely for this matter. Yet today’s learners casually remember a word or two from the former worthies and mistake it for the Dao, endlessly discussing it. Then there are the foolish ones who, without studying the conduct of immortals and sages, slander the practice of cultivation, saying, \"In this world, there is birth and there is death—how could there be a way to endure forever?\" These are seeds of hell, willingly bound to the wheel of rebirth. Next are the attached ones who, when someone vaguely points out a side door or minor path, claim they can walk it. Having never encountered a true immortal or perfected person, they neither know how to return to the root and revive the mandate nor understand the dharma beyond the world, nor do they recognize what \"of the same kind\" means. If they did know, and could conceal themselves within the ordinary world to complete this great task of conditioned existence, yet still acted recklessly without caution, would they not invite calamity? Thus, the scripture says: \"Knowing constancy is called clarity; not knowing constancy and acting recklessly invites misfortune.\" Knowing constancy is to be accommodating; being accommodating is to be impartial.\n\nOu Leng secretly transmitted the method for forging the sword,\nMoye’s metal and water tempered softness and hardness.\nOnce refined, it understands the wielder’s intent,\nChasing evil a thousand miles in a flash of lightning.\n\nDao Guang says: When Ou Ye forged the sword, the Heavenly Emperor sent a divine maiden to tend the furnace. It was crafted with metal and water, tempered with softness and hardness. Once completed, it could slay demons like a flash of lightning, so wondrous was its power. The sage’s work in forging the sword is the same: using heaven and earth as the furnace, yin and yang as water and fire, harmonizing the five phases, refining with spirit and qi. Once the precious sword is forged, it can bend or straighten, soften or harden, do good or evil, be round or square. When the mind conceives a thought or the will directs an intention, it flies forth to slay in a flash of lightning. This is the divine sword. Without this sword in elixir refinement, it is like trying to catch fish or rabbits without a net or snare.\n\nZi Ye says: In refining the elixir and gathering the medicine, one relies entirely on the wisdom sword to subdue demons and slay monsters. In an instant, it transforms; in the blink of an eye, it traverses ten thousand miles. If the wisdom sword lacks sharpness, how could it not be harmed by demons and monsters?\n\nShang Yang Zi says: To forge this sword, one cannot use ordinary metal or iron. This divine sword slays the Three Corpses within and eliminates evil without. The foolish use this sword to destroy themselves; the sage uses it to make their spirit soar. Master Jingyang had five immortal maidens play with the sword to slay the demonic flood dragon. Dongbin used the Three Clarities’ sacred sword to erase the traces of spirits. In Buddhism, it is also called the Vajra Treasure Sword—truly the instrument of immortals and Buddhas.\n\nKnocking bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade mushroom,\nPlaying the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife-point elixir.\nLately, the golden light shines through the body,\nNot speaking of these principles to ordinary people.\n\nDao Guang says: Bamboo is a hollow-hearted thing, embodying the meaning of non-attachment. The zither produces the proper sound of music, embodying the meaning of harmony. The turtle is the Black Tiger; the phoenix is the Red Dragon. The qi of the dragon’s string is called the jade mushroom; the qi of the tiger’s string is called the knife-point elixir. The dragon and tiger are non-sentient beings, yet they can mate, hence the term \"knocking,\" like two things striking each other. When the dragon and tiger unite as husband and wife, they achieve harmony, hence the term \"playing the zither.\" When the dragon and tiger mate, the qi of their two strings swallow and devour each other. Once the returning elixir is refined, the golden light shines through the body, radiant with mystery and brilliance, wind rising beneath both armpits to depart the mortal realm.\n\nZi Ye says: The jade mushroom and knife-point elixir are alternate names for the medicine. The medicine is born in Kan, which contains the yang of Qian. Qian is metal and jade, hence the metaphors of jade mushroom and knife-point elixir. Knocking bamboo and playing the zither are the harmonious sounds of yin and yang seeking each other.",

      "translated_text": "The bamboo, hollow at heart, responds with primal desire; the zither, tuned to true harmony, remains undisturbed. This resonance is no ordinary perverse or deceptive sound—no lewd music of Zheng or Wei. Blowing the tortoise to summon the phoenix: that which is rooted in Heaven inclines upward, while that which is rooted in Earth inclines downward. As *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states, this is the meaning of the \"upper magpie bridge\" and the \"lower magpie bridge.\" Moreover, Li is the bird, the Vermilion Phoenix of the southern direction, a metaphor for Kan. To summon Li is to receive its medicine, for Li is none other than myself.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: Bamboo is a thing hollow within and straight without; if it is not straight, one knocks it to ensure it responds to things. The zither embodies the harmony of its strings and markers; if it is not harmonious, one tunes it to accomplish the task at hand. The jade mushroom is the Qian dragon, while the knife-point elixir is a Kun substance. To call the tortoise pertains to me; to summon the phoenix requires the other. Without great harmony, how could one summon the phoenix? For those who cultivate the Way, once the hexagram qi has passed, if the bamboo fails to respond, must it not be struck? Striking is knocking. If the zither is not in harmony, must it not be tuned? Tuning is playing.\n\nThus, whether at seventy, eighty, or even one hundred and twenty years of age, one may still refine the returning elixir—such is this Dao. How could mediocre scholars or common men comprehend this? How could false teachers or deluded practitioners ever know it?

      "translated_text": "Long ago, my master Ziqiong often attended the Supreme Void Perfected One. Once, a disputatious scholar sought an audience, daily striking bamboo, blowing the tortoise, and swallowing jade mushrooms. He asked my master, \"What is calling the tortoise?\" The Supreme Void replied, \"I shall tell you of calling the tortoise, but first, let me ask you: what is the adversary bamboo?\"\n\nThe scholar answered, \"The highest of the highest interlocking mechanisms.\"\n\nThe Supreme Void said, \"I do not ask of the highest interlocking mechanisms. Tell me, what is striking the bamboo?\"\n\nThe scholar replied, \"The most profound and subtle of mechanisms.\"\n\nThe Supreme Void said, \"These words of yours were learned from those who sit endlessly on long benches. Take them and debate with the world—this is not the place for you to call the tortoise.\" The man failed to awaken. After Ziqiong dragged him out, the Supreme Void asked Ziqiong, \"Do you know striking the bamboo?\"\n\nZiqiong answered, \"Abiding in stillness, yet responding when moved.\"\n\nThe Supreme Void asked, \"Do you know calling the tortoise?\"\n\nZiqiong replied, \"Offering deference to others brings its own reward.\"\n\nThe Supreme Void said, \"Why did the disputatious scholar not speak thus?\"\n\nZiqiong answered, \"He has not received a master’s transmission and thus cannot force a guess.\"\n\nThe Supreme Void admonished further: \"To know is not difficult; to practice is the true difficulty. The medicine meets its kindred qi and only then forms its image; the Dao resides in the subtle and imperceptible, harmonizing with nature. When a single grain of the numinous elixir is swallowed, one begins to know that my life is not ruled by heaven.\"\n\nDaoguang said: \"There is a thing formlessly formed, born before heaven and earth. The sages forcibly named it the Primordial Unity of the True One’s qi—though invisible to the eye, it responds when moved. Descending, it becomes the numinous elixir, like a single precious pearl within the empty mystery. Take and ingest it, and immediately mercury is stabilized and lead transmuted, transforming into a body of pure yang: one’s years then equal heaven’s. Chaoyuanzi said: 'Death and life are entirely the Dao of heaven and earth; one’s nature and life originally belong to mercury and lead.' Is this not proof that my life lies in what I do?\"\n\nZiye said: \"The Dao is simply the Dao—purity and stillness are essential. The medicine is simply the medicine—only when it meets its kindred does it form. If one seeks what is not its kindred, one’s efforts are in vain.\"\n\nShangyangzi said: \"The *Book of Changes* states, 'In the southwest, one gains companions and walks with one’s kind.' If two yang forces are of the same kind, they become scorching drought—how could there be mutual resonance of nature and feeling? If two yin forces share the same chamber, there must be strife—how could yin and yang be of the same kind? Only when yin follows yang does it become kindred; only when lead enters water does it become medicine. The medicine transforms into the elixir, the elixir into spirit; when form and spirit are both wondrous, life lies within me. The radiant golden elixir is completed in a single day—ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding. Those who speak of nine years or three years merely procrastinate and delay.\"\n\nDaoguang said: \"The great medicine of the golden elixir—even an inferior practitioner need not exceed half an hour to obtain and ingest it. When I speak of 'a single day,' I refer to seizing that half-hour within it. Once the golden elixir enters the mouth, one immediately ascends to the sacred realm. With such wondrous efficacy, how could one delay for nine years or three?\"\n\nZiye said: \"The method of making the elixir fundamentally requires the union of lead and mercury, and in an instant, the elixir’s essence forms. Yet one must thoroughly understand the moment when lead is born—at that time, the myriad things sprout, possessing qi but no form; the water’s source is utterly pure. How wondrous! And what time is this? Ah! It is the moment when this year ends and the next has not yet begun.\"\n\nShangyangzi said: \"The method of refining the elixir requires knowing the other’s living *zi* hour. If this is not the utmost subtlety in the world, who could attain it? The great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—know that it depends on both oneself and heaven. Without accumulating virtuous deeds and cultivating hidden virtue, one will surely encounter demonic obstacles.\"\n\nDaoguang said: \"Demonic obstacles lie in the external; cultivation lies within me. With abundant hidden virtue, the numinous elixir may be hoped for.\"\n\nZiye said: \"The great Dao of the golden elixir—ancient masters transmitted it once in ten thousand kalpas, for it is no trifling matter. The Dao is lofty, and thus demons must flourish. Without the support of hidden virtue, one may suffer the calamity of a broken will.\"\n\nShangyangzi said: \"Earlier, I spoke of 'my life not being ruled by heaven,' meaning the wondrous workings of creation lie within me. Here, I say 'it depends on both oneself and heaven,' for refining the returning elixir first requires accumulating hidden virtue. To give without seeking repayment is hidden virtue. To accumulate good deeds without others knowing is hidden virtue. To not lead others into peril is hidden virtue. To secretly perform acts of kindness is hidden virtue. Great cultivators who have not yet amassed sufficient virtue are rarely unassailed by external demons. If one can reflect inwardly, cultivate great forbearance, and advance with diligence, then demonic obstacles transform into hidden virtue. The scriptures say: 'When misfortune comes, I return with blessing. When resentment comes, I repay with virtue.' All this is the power of abundant hidden virtue and the merit of subduing demons.\"\n\nThe three powers mutually steal, and at their appointed time, the Dao, virtue, and immortals conceal this mechanism. When the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease, the hundred bones are all ordered, and non-action is realized.\n\nDaoguang said: \"Heaven and earth steal from the myriad things through the four seasons, thus there is flourishing and withering, and they cannot remain forever flourishing. The myriad things steal from humans through the five flavors, thus there is life and death, and they cannot remain forever living. Humans steal from the myriad things through the five phases, thus there is preservation and destruction, and they cannot remain forever preserved. When the three stealings are fitting and the three powers are at peace, there is life and death, flourishing and withering, preservation and destruction, things and self—all arising in profusion, endlessly cycling. This is the natural Dao. If one can merge these three stealings into one, reverse their mechanism and act, go against their time and ingest, then the hundred bones are all ordered, the myriad transformations are naturally at peace, all concerns cease, and the Dao of non-action is realized.\"\n\nZiye said: \"To steal is to take what others do not perceive. The method of cultivation steals the mechanism of heaven and earth, pilfering the life within death. When one grasps this principle, the hundred bones are at peace.\"",
      "overlap_context": "it not be struck? Striking is knocking. If the zither is not in harmony, must it not be tuned? Tuning is playing.\n\nThus, whether at seventy, eighty, or even one hundred and twenty years of age, one may still refine the returning elixir—such is this Dao. How could mediocre scholars or common men comprehend this? How could false teachers or deluded practitioners ever know it? Without the oral transmission of a true immortal or sagely master under heaven’s covenant, who could attain this knowledge?",

      "translated_text": "Lord Shangyang said: \"The term 'stealing' is not what the vulgar world calls theft. It is the method of the Golden Elixir, stealing that primordial, pre-heaven and pre-earth spark of true yang’s inception-qi to refine the Returned Elixir. Only those of lofty Dao and weighty virtue—those who are among the immortals—can conceal and employ this mechanism. It is not something those of slanderous virtue and corrupt conduct, or mediocre people, can know. Even if they chance to know it, they either doubt or are deluded. Why? Because they lack virtue. Thus, the immortals of Dao and virtue conceal this mechanism.\n\n*The Three Strategies* contains over three hundred treasured characters; *The Scripture of Dao and Virtue* holds five thousand numinous words. Countless immortals of past and present have all, through this, attained the true explanation.\n\nDaoguang said: \"These two scriptures are the pivot of all scriptures, the linchpin controlling the mechanisms of all masters.\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"*The Three Strategies* and *The Scripture of Dao and Virtue* are the ancestral texts of the Elixir. All immortals have revered them as stepping-stones, cultivating them to achieve the Dao. Yet their meaning is profound and distant; the world is shallow, people frivolous, and few can grasp this. Thus, the immortal master composed *Awakening to Reality*, so that later learners, upon seeing it, would be immediately enlightened, easily comprehending and practicing it. Know then that *The Three Strategies*, *The Scripture of Dao and Virtue*, and *Awakening to Reality*—these three books speak of one and the same matter.\n\nThough your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,\nWithout a radiant teacher, do not force your guesses.\nFor the Golden Elixir has no oral transmission—\nWhere then can you conceive the numinous embryo?\n\nDaoguang said: \"A thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises merely spread branches and leaves. The supreme Dao is not complex—it is uniquely transmitted as the mind-seal. Without encountering a true teacher, forced guesses will not suffice.\"\n\nZiye said: \"Without the true essentials from a teacher’s oral transmission, where can one begin?\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"The nine schools and hundred arts can all be left on paper, or known through clever guesses and wisdom. Only the matter of the Golden Elixir cannot be grasped by force of will without a true teacher’s step-by-step guidance. Some may receive a teacher’s brief words on the crucible but not know the time when the medicine arises—this will not produce the Elixir. Knowing the medicine but not the firing times will not produce the Elixir. Knowing the firing times but not the inversion will not produce the Elixir. Knowing the inversion but not the subtle refinement of the self will not produce the Elixir. Knowing the refinement of the self but not the dual use of method and resources will not produce the Elixir. Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingesting the Medicine* states: 'A deviation by a hair’s breadth will fail to produce the Elixir.'\n\nAlas! The foolish of the world rely on their wit, seeking to understand through words. They trust their cleverness, attempting to grasp it through the mind. Some, through perverse means, practice 'exploratory battles'; others merely sit in dry emptiness. The immortal master’s compassion is boundless; his verses are urgent, and many later seekers have benefited.\n\nOnce the mind-monkey is thoroughly tamed and the mechanism of the square inch is stilled,\nThree thousand merits and deeds align with heaven.\nNaturally, the crucible simmers dragon and tiger—\nWhy cling to home, long for wife and child?\n\nDaoguang said: \"These words are most earnest—why do people not turn back?\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"Heaven and earth’s work: spring births, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter seals. The flourishing and withering of the myriad things, the revolutions of the stars—creation’s turning completes its cycle in just three hundred sixty days. For the cultivator, restraining the mind-monkey, cleansing the square inch, retrieving the jewel from the river of desire—this takes but half a double-hour. Guarding the Returned Elixir within the chamber of spirit for some three thousand days, merits fill creation, virtue subdues ghosts and spirits—is this not merit and deeds aligning with heaven?\n\nBefore refining the Returned Elixir, hasten to begin—\nTime waits for no one.\nOnce refined, know when to stop.\nIf you cling to fullness with an insatiable heart,\nYou may one day suffer disgrace.\n\nDaoguang said: \"If the Elixir is not yet refined, hasten to begin—time does not wait. Once the Elixir is refined, embrace oneness and guard completion, facing the wall for nine years—thus the Dao is magnified.\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"Before refining the Returned Elixir, hasten to refine it. Once the Elixir is refined, hasten to leave it. The Buddha said: 'After achieving the Dao, abandon the alchemical chamber and its vessels.' If you do not leave them, the mind’s realm will appear before you, and the two fears may bring disgrace. The Perfected One of Purple Clarity and White Truth, at midnight, suddenly encountered wind and thunder—this is the proof. Thus, Bodhidharma left the long robe and sat coldly in Shaolin, free from any day’s calamity.\n\nYou must turn the door of death into the door of life—\nDo not cling to the gate of life as the gate of death.\nIf you grasp the mechanism of killing and understand reversal,\nYou will know that harm conceals grace.\n\nDaoguang said: \"The five phases, in sequence, bring life; in reversal, bring death—this is the common Dao. Life that does not generate is long life; compliance that is not compliance is supreme compliance—this is the Elixir Dao. If you can understand this, then harm conceals grace, and a man may conceive.\"\n\nLord Shangyang said: \"The poem says: 'Illumine the gates and doors, urgently repair them.' If people today grasp this principle, understand the mechanism of life and death, recognize the use of inversion, know the wonder of return, and transform the gate of life and killing—turning suffering into joy, enduring to gather grace—what worry is there of not attaining immortality?\n\nFortune and misfortune arise mutually, interdependent,\nLike echoes and shadows following one another.\nIf you can turn this mechanism of life and killing,\nIn the space of a hand’s turn, calamity becomes blessing.\n\nDaoguang said: \"Yang governs life and is called fortune; yin governs killing and is called misfortune. When yin diminishes, yang grows; when yang reaches its peak, yin arises—mutually interdependent, this is the common Dao. If you cultivate by reversing the mechanism of life and killing, in the space of a hand’s turn, calamity becomes blessing, harm conceals grace, a man may conceive—this is the Elixir Dao.\"\n\nZiye said: \"The five phases in sequence are the fire-pit of the dharma-realm.

      "translated_text": "Lord Daoguang, upon hearing the words of Apricot Grove, cast off his monastic robes and returned to lay life to fulfill the great matter—was this not blending with the vulgar? The Sixth Patriarch, upon receiving the Fifth Patriarch’s teaching, entered among hunters, unknown to all—was this not blending with the vulgar? Our Great Void Perfected One, having received the wondrous instructions of Master Yellow Chamber, withdrew to seclude himself in Mount Wuyi for seven months before attaining the Dao—was this not harmonizing one’s radiance?\n\nYet today’s yellow-robed and black-clad followers, shaving their crowns and donning patched robes, coiling their topknots and squaring their cassocks—do they truly comprehend the great sigh of our sagely teaching on the burden of possessing a body? How could they know that this very bodily form becomes the greatest obstacle to entering the chamber?\n\nThus, the great hermit in the marketplace dust makes himself unfathomable to others. Those who cultivate the Dharma beyond the world ensure that none can discern their actions or concealment. As Laozi said: *\"When you greet it, you do not see its head; when you follow it, you do not see its rear.\"* And again: *\"Only because it cannot be known is it forced to take on form.\"*\n\nHaving attained this clarity, one looks back at the foolish common folk who seek the Dao through cunning schemes, shallow knowledge, and wanton indulgence—they are farther from it than ever. For those of great cultivation who have reached this stage, should they not repeatedly ponder this poem to achieve the meritorious work of the Dao?\n\n*Five-Character Verse—Symbolizing the Wondrousness of the Great One Containing True Qi*\nA maiden dons azure robes,\nA young lord wears white silk.\nSeen, it cannot be used;\nUsed, it cannot be seen.\nIn vagueness they meet,\nIn darkness transformations arise.\nIn a flash, flames soar—\nThe true person naturally appears.\n\nLord Daoguang said: The maiden is the latent *qi* of the dragon, called Wood Maiden, born of the Azure Dragon—hence she wears azure robes. The young lord is the latent *qi* of the tiger, called Metal Lord, born of the White Tiger—hence he wears white silk. That which has form and can be seen belongs to the dross of later heaven and cannot be used. Only the primordial true unified *qi*, born before heaven and earth, dwelling in vagueness, emerging from darkness, boundless and expansive, spiritually transforming, giving birth to being from non-being—when the fire practice is rectified, the true person appears. This is the wondrousness of the Dao. Without encountering a true master to personally transmit the oral instructions, who could attain this?\n\nZiye said: The maiden in azure robes is Wood Mercury. The young lord in white silk is Water Metal. When yin and yang unite, their unmanifested *qi* intermingles in darkness and vagueness—only then can it be used. Once form appears, it becomes later heaven and cannot be used.\n\nLord Shangyang said: These eight lines of verse encompass the wondrous workings of an entire alchemical classic. The first line concerns the affairs of the *Zhen* palace, Wood Mercury, belonging to oneself. The second line concerns the affairs of the *Dui* palace, Lead, belonging to the other. The third line gives birth to beings; the fourth refines the elixir. The fifth line enters the chamber to begin work; the sixth guards against danger. The seventh line is the elixir’s ninefold transmutation; the eighth, the completion of three thousand merits. The immortal master composed this poem solely to point out the primordial true unified *qi*—the initial *qi* contained by the Great One. Should the scholar not seek a master?\n\n*Twelve \"Moon over the West River\" Verses—Symbolizing the Twelve Months*\nThe immortal master said: *West* is the direction of metal. *River* is the essence of water. *Moon* is the function of the elixir. The inner medicine is like the outer medicine; if the inner is open, the outer must also be open. The elixir’s essence harmonizes with like kinds—its nurturing employs two distinct functions. Within, there is the celestial true fire, blazing red in the furnace. Without, the outer furnace’s increase and decrease require diligent effort. No wonder is greater than the true seed.\n\nLord Daoguang said: The *Breaking Delusion Song* of the Gate of Yi states: *\"The Dao is within—set up the furnace; the tripod is without. The Dao is without—Kan and Li; lead and mercury are within.\"* This clarifies the two medicines, inner and outer. The outer medicine is the Golden Elixir. Its transformation occurs in the furnace of the two eights, taking no more than half a double-hour to mature. The inner medicine is the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir. Its transformation occurs within one’s own body, requiring a full ten months before the embryo can shed its mortal form and become a sage. Though the two medicines’ functions are somewhat alike, their fire times in practice are vastly different.\n\nWhen we disciples work on the outer elixir, at the moment of harmonizing the elixir’s essence, the slightest error prevents the great medicine from forming. When harmonizing the inner elixir’s essence, one must be most cautious to guard against danger. Though the inner elixir possesses celestial true fire, blazing red within the earthen crucible, one must still diligently adjust the outer furnace’s fire. Yet the endless transformations of the inner and outer true fires truly rely on the wondrousness of true lead. This substance alone can capture mercury and prevent it from flying away.\n\nMaster Ye Wenshu, failing to grasp this principle, claimed that the inner medicine is refined by true fire, while the outer medicine requires the addition of mundane fire. Alas! He had not received a master’s guidance and merely peered at the heavens through a tube. He did not understand that though the two medicines differ in being inner and outer, their function follows a single path.\n\nThe reason for inner and outer lies in this: a person’s body, endowed with the finest *qi* of heaven and earth, is born and entrusted to yin and yang to be cast into illusory form. Thus, within this single form, essence, *qi*, and spirit are primary. Spirit is born of *qi*, *qi* is born of essence, and essence is born of spirit. If a cultivator of the elixir clings to this body and practices within it, they do no more than refine the three substances of essence, *qi*, and spirit. Yet these three are all born of later heaven and earth, purely yin without yang. How could refining them enable one to transcend heaven and earth?\n\nMaster Zhongli said: *\"Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and marrow—these seven substances are all yin.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "atedly exhort them with worldly teachings—how earnest they are!\nFor the Golden Elixir, the greatest difficulty lies in blending with the vulgar.\nThe deepest subtlety lies in harmonizing one’s radiance.\nThough possessing wondrous efficacy, one does not display sharp edges—\nAdapting to the world with roundness and squareness,\nSubtly shaping transformation without revealing it.\nAt this stage, who can discern one’s actions or concealment?\nAll these are truly the highest matters of great cultivation.",

      "translated_text": "It is further said: *\"To refine but a single substance is to nurture solitary yin.\"*\n\nThe sage knows that one’s true essence, born after heaven and earth, belongs to yin—difficult to seize, easy to lose. Thus, one must seek the primordial *qi* of prior heaven, capturing in a single moment the true yin and true yang, the twofold and eightfold substances of the same kind, to refine them into a single grain. This is called the Elixir of Supreme Yang, known as True Lead. Its creation lies without, hence it is called the Outer Medicine. Then, with this Yang Elixir, one seizes one’s own yin mercury, like a cat catching a mouse. The Yang Elixir is the mother-*qi* of heaven and earth, while one’s own mercury is the child-*qi* of heaven and earth. To subdue the child-*qi* with the mother-*qi*—is this not of the same kind? Its creation lies within, hence it is called the Inner Medicine.\n\nThereupon, borrowing the fire of yin-yang tally, one applies the methods of withdrawal and addition. After ten months, the work is complete: form transforms into *qi*, *qi* transforms into spirit, and spirit merges with the Dao. Ascending into the formless, one’s transformations become unfathomable. Thus, one transcends heaven and earth, stands beyond the realm of creation, and grasps heaven and earth to mold yin and yang—yet is not molded by yin and yang. This is the work of the primordial *qi* of prior heaven.\n\nSuch wondrous subtlety is unparalleled, for nothing surpasses the true seed. How could one use the ordinary lead, mercury, cinnabar, or fire of later heaven—impure substances of a different kind—as the Outer Medicine?\n\nScholars of the Dao must delve into the root and origin, meticulously distinguishing between the true and the false. Let none be deceived by fraudulent pretenders who feign lofty attainment to mislead later generations. Those who do so shall forever sink into the Three Wretched Realms.\n\nZiye said: *\"The Way of the Inner Elixir closely resembles the work of the Outer Medicine and furnace-fire. Generally, mercury cannot be subdued without lead. He who understands the outer work will easily grasp the inner.\"*\n\nShangyangzi said: *\"Those who cultivate the Dao must first thoroughly comprehend the true workings of the two yin and yang—inner and outer. Then, when entering the chamber to begin the work, success will come easily. The Inner Medicine is what one inherently possesses, while the Outer Medicine is what the body produces. The Inner Medicine resides within oneself, while the Outer Medicine emerges from one’s form. The Inner Medicine does not depart from one’s body, just as the Outer Medicine does not depart from one’s appearance. The Inner Medicine completes one’s nature, while the Outer Medicine fulfills both nature and life. The Inner Medicine is essence, the Outer Medicine is *qi*. Essence and *qi* do not part, hence they are called the true seed. Only when nature and life are cultivated together can one attain the rank of Heavenly Immortal.\"*\n\nThis Dao is most divine and sagely—lest one’s meager allotment prove insufficient to bear its marvels. When lead and mercury are harmonized, the work is not even a full morning’s labor, and soon the first signs of the Mysterious Pearl appear. If a determined practitioner refines this, why should they not dwell in the marketplace or court? The work is easy, the medicine not distant—yet to speak of it makes others laugh.\n\nDaoguang said: *\"When the Golden Elixir enters the mouth, one instantly ascends to sagehood—is this not most divine and sagely? The refinement takes but half an hour—is this not most simple and easy? It is found in every household, unrestricted by marketplace or court—is this not most near? Precisely because it is so near, to speak of it makes others laugh. Those who attain it need only fear lacking merit or virtue, forgetting their teacher, or turning from the Dao—such would be unworthy of its wonder.\"*\n\nZiye said: *\"The matter of the Golden Elixir is called divine and sagely because of its supreme efficacy. Its efficacy is like standing a pole to cast a shadow or calling into a valley to hear an echo—not some empty, illusory art. This Golden Elixir consists solely of lead and mercury: lead comes from without, mercury arises from within. Once the willing heart is discerned, the Mysterious Pearl takes form. The work is easy—why seek secluded mountains and marshes for refinement?\"*\n\nShangyangzi said: *\"The Way of the Returned Elixir lies in subduing the dragon and taming the tiger, stealing the creative power of heaven and earth—how wondrous and divine! Motionless in stillness, yet responsive when moved—how spiritually efficacious! Those who hear and believe, receiving and practicing diligently, are of great root and superior capacity. Those who hear and laugh in scorn are of meager allotment and poor fortune. When lead and mercury unite and the Mysterious Pearl appears, this is called the Golden Elixir. This Elixir is present in the marketplace and home, in daily use and nightly labor—inherently complete, without constraint. Yet foolish worldly people claim that those who cultivate the Dao must dwell in deep mountains, shun the marketplace, abandon wife and children, or sit in solitary inaction to be true practitioners. How could they know the workings of true yin and true yang?\"*\n\nThe White Tiger’s *First Scripture* is the supreme treasure, the divine water of the Flowery Pond, true gold. Thus, one knows the source of highest good runs deep—unlike ordinary medicinal substances.\n\nIf one wishes to refine the Nine Revolutions, one must first refine the self and master the heart. At the proper time, gather and stabilize the floating and sinking, advancing the fire while guarding against peril.\n\nDaoguang said: *\"The ‘first’ refers to the beginning. The First Scripture is the *qi* of the White Tiger’s initial crescent—this is not the art of chamber-room elixirs or dual cultivation. To speak of the twenty-four methods of the Three Peaks for gathering yin is to slander the Great Dao. Nine generations of ancestors will forever sink as lower ghosts, and one will face karmic retribution in this very life. The Dao cannot be slandered, just as heaven cannot be climbed by steps.\"*\n\nMoreover, the *qi* of True Unity in heaven is called the Water of True Unity; in the tiger, it is called the *qi* of the initial crescent. When refined in the Flowery Pond, it is called divine water—this is the supreme treasure of true gold. All these do not depart from the essence of True Unity, flowing through various places, hence their many different names. Yet each can accomplish creation.\n\nThe scripture says: *\"The highest good is like water.\"* The Water of True Unity is born before heaven and earth, hence it is called the highest good. Its source runs deep—unlike the impure substances of later heaven.\n\nThe Nine Revolutions refer to nine years of work after the ten-month gestation of the embryo is complete—this is the nine years of wall-facing practice of Bodhidharma. If one wishes to refine the wonder of the Nine Revolutions, one must first refine the self, stabilize the floating and sinking, and distinguish host from guest. Gather at the proper time, embrace the feminine without asserting the masculine, and thus avoid peril.",

      "translated_text": "Refining the fire for ten months, the form naturally transforms into qi, and qi transforms into spirit. Embracing the Origin and guarding the One, after nine years the work is complete—form and spirit both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth. The sages forcibly name this the *Nine Revolutions Golden Elixir of Great Return*.\n\nZiye said: *\"At sixteen, a man’s true essence flows; at fourteen, a woman’s heavenly water arrives.\"* When it first descends, is this the first essence or not? Ah! *On the road, meet a swordsman and present your blade; only when the lute finds a knowing ear may it be played*—the divine water is indeed the first essence.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The highest good is like water, benefiting all things without contention.\"* The True Person uses the first essence and divine water as metaphors, speaking of their power to give life, unlike other round or scattered substances.\n\nThe external medicine’s nine revolutions complete the cycle of fire. When the elixir ripens and the nine revolutions are to be achieved, refining the self and stabilizing the mind are essential.\n\nShangyangzi said: *\"The White Tiger is a difficult creature to tame; if used according to the Way, it cannot harm.\"* As a rare substance, if sought at the proper time, it must hold the destiny of a celestial immortal. This White Tiger’s first essence is forcibly named the *Primordial Unity Qi*.\n\nThe immortal masters’ teachings are too subtle, while Xue and Lu’s annotations are too detailed. If foolish people mistake this for bedroom arts or chamber elixir techniques, calamity will befall them. Only when a scholar understands the principle of *\"the moon emerging on the third day after geng,\"* may they seek the use of the *Flower Pool’s divine water*.\n\nThe Way of the Returning Elixir is easy to practice, but refining the self is most difficult. Thus, the immortal masters warn: refine the self first. Even Pure Yang said: *\"The returning elixir lies within a person, but one must first refine the self and await the proper time.\"* Why? Fire is the most numinous of things—beyond human comprehension, yet it knows first, like a witness to the budding flower. If even ordinary fire is so perceptive, how much more so the true fire, which is one’s own mercury? One must first refine this true fire, subdue this true dragon, prevent it from fleeing, and command it at will. Only then can the White Tiger be tamed to obtain the true gold of the supreme treasure.\n\nThe sagely masters devoted such care to this, fearing that later practitioners would fail to refine the self. Then, when the time arrives and the furnace is tended, not a single grain of the supreme treasure will be obtained—instead, peril and distress will follow. Those who cultivate the Way must first thoroughly master the work of refining the self.\n\nThe Cowherd and Weaver Girl’s love is a meeting of the Dao; the tortoise and snake naturally embody heaven’s decree. The toad and crow meet at the new moon, their beauty united; the two qi mutually support and revolve. This is the wondrous work of heaven and earth—who can fathom this profound source? When yin and yang are blocked and divided, how can they endure as long as heaven and earth?\n\nDaoguang said: *\"The Cowherd recognizes the Weaver Girl, meeting once a year. The great yang and great yin unite once a month. The tortoise and snake, coiled like dragons, support one another—all are moved by the two qi of yin and yang, the very root of the great Dao.\"* The workings of the golden elixir and great medicine are the same. The true Unity qi is subtle and formless; without the union of the two-eight yin and yang qi, how could it descend and take shape as a grain of millet? After obtaining the elixir and consuming it, without the binding of yin-yang talismanic fire, how could it transform into the golden liquid returning elixir?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"The turtledoves call to one another,\non the isle in the river.\nThe fair maiden,\nthe noble man’s good match.\nThe male does not dwell alone,\nthe female does not live in solitude.\"*\nHow profound! The Dark Warrior’s tortoise and snake coil together, illustrating that the female and male must mutually depend—this is the principle, what doubt remains? The immortal elder repeatedly emphasizes this chapter; those deeply versed in the Dao will grasp its meaning with intuition.\n\nZiye said: *\"The Cowherd and Weaver Girl are two celestial stars, meeting once a year at the Magpie Bridge on the seventh night. The tortoise and snake are creatures of the earth, yet they too can mate. The sun and moon meet at the new moon—all follow the Way of one yin and one yang seeking union.\"* In the wondrous work of elixir-making, if one has only solitary yin or widowed yang without a counterpart, can they not seek it?\n\nShangyangzi said: *\"The Cowherd and Weaver Girl are constellations; the toad and crow represent the sun and moon. The tortoise and snake are armored creatures, yet they too rely on the two qi of yin and yang to revolve.\"* Nowadays, people practice solitary yin or widowed yang, sitting alone in deep mountains, believing this is cultivation and can lead to longevity—how utterly mistaken! Do they not know that when yin and yang are blocked, creation cannot be accomplished, let alone the Way of the golden elixir?\n\nIf you wish to retain true lead and keep mercury close, the minister never leaves the household. Wood and metal are separated and cannot meet without cause—you must rely on the matchmaker to bring them together.\n\nWood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,\nMetal’s essence yearns for wood’s kindness.\nThey devour and embrace one another, yet grow closer—\nOnly then does the man realize he is with child.\n\nDaoguang said: *\"Lead is metal on the outside; mercury is wood within. The two are separated—only with the Yellow Dame’s mediation can the elixir be formed. Swallowed into the belly, it unites with one’s own mercury. Metal’s nature is fiercely upright, wood’s nature is gentle and compassionate. Their natures naturally love and yearn for one another, devouring and embracing, binding as husband and wife to conceive a child within the belly—hence it is said ‘with child.’\"* This Dao is wondrous indeed! If not for a person of compassion, virtue, and merit in aiding others, it would be nearly impossible to encounter.\n\nZiye said: *\"Mercury comes from oneself, but without lead, it cannot be subdued. Lead is born in the palace of Kun, so they are separated. To bring lead and mercury together, a matchmaker is indispensable.\"* The matchmaker serves to unite yin and yang. Things born of the same qi are kin—though separated, they long for one another and cannot be abandoned. Thus, wood’s nature cannot but love metal, and metal’s essence cannot but yearn for wood. Why? Because they both arise from the same qi. Without penetrating insight into yin and yang and profound understanding of creation, who could partake in this?",

      "translated_text": "Master Shangyang said: True lead is born within the Cavern of Creation and dwells within the Body of Creation. If one cannot hold the heart and refine the self, mercury will flee. If one does not attend the furnace in due time, lead will fly. The \"household minister\" is none other than one’s own mercury. If refined to maturity, it can be commanded at will. Though wood loves metal in dutiful devotion, without wealth it cannot win its favor. Though metal yearns for wood with deep affection, without a matchmaker it cannot reach its beloved. Once the matchmaker brokers their union and wealth secures their joy, they naturally consume one another—thus the man conceives the embryo.\n\nIf one does not nurture with virtue or bestow kindness with benevolence, how can they be commanded when the moment arrives?\n\n*Whose house holds the maiden of sixteen?*\n*Where dwells the youth of twenty-seven?*\n*Self-styled \"wood’s essence\" and \"metal’s essence,\"*\n*Yet meeting earth, they form three lineages.*\n*With Ding’s refining fire lent further,*\n*Husband and wife at last unite in joy.*\n*The River Chariot dares not pause—*\n*It ascends to Kunlun’s peak.*\n\nDaoguang said: The maiden is wood’s essence, called mercury. The youth is metal’s essence, called lead. This speaks of lead and mercury within the earthen crucible, which must rely on the fire’s inner refinement and outer tempering to unite in joy. Thus, the tally of yin and yang’s fire must never pause; all phases of qi depend on the single heart. Transported to Kunlun’s summit, it is infused with nurturing warmth to form the Reverted Elixir.\n\nZiye said: Mercury belongs to yin, hence the maiden of sixteen. Lead belongs to yang, hence the youth of twenty-seven. Mercury is wood’s essence; lead is metal’s essence. With earth as matchmaker, the three lineages unite in marriage. Refined by Ding’s fire, lead and mercury merge, husband and wife conjoin. Fire’s nature is to rise, but the elixir, steamed by fire’s qi, finds the River Chariot’s path and soars to the Mud Pill.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: The maiden is mercury from the Li Palace; the youth is lead from the Kan. Earth is the agent that unites the two. Only with earth can metal and wood consummate their union, and the River Chariot ascend to Kunlun’s peak.\n\n*Seven returns—cinnabar reverts to its root.*\n*Nine reversions—golden nectar restores the true.*\n*Do not count the hours from Zi to Shen—*\n*Only when the Five Agents align is the standard met.*\n\n*It is but a single taste of quicksilver,*\n*Yet it courses through all the celestial stems.*\n*When yin and yang’s numbers are complete, it naturally attains the divine—*\n*How could its entry and exit ever leave the Mysterious Female?*\n\nDaoguang said: The nine reversions and seven returns do not depart from the numbers of heaven, earth, and the Five Agents. Those who count from Zi in the hour of Yin to Shen mistake the matter. \"Return\" means reverting to the root; \"reversion\" means restoring the origin. Quicksilver is mercury, mercury is the essence of the True One. In its first transformation, it becomes water in the north; in its second, cinnabar in the south; in its third, mercury in the east; in its fourth, metal in the west; in its fifth, the elixir in the center. This elixir is not born without heaven and earth, not produced without sun and moon, not perfected without the four seasons, not completed without the Five Agents, not achieved without the total number. Thus, coursing through all the celestial stems, with yin and yang’s numbers fulfilled, it naturally transforms and attains the divine.\n\nZiye said: Fire is the number seven; metal is the number nine. The mutual dependence of metal and fire is the essence of elixir-making. Metal does not revert without fire; fire does not return without metal. *The Dragon-Tiger Scripture* states: \"No alchemical art is more luminous than that of metal and fire.\" This is what it means. Metal within water is called quicksilver. The Inner Elixir’s completion does not depart from this single taste. Master its subtlety, and it naturally traverses all the celestial stems, transforming with the seasons and qi. Know that to grasp its wonder, one must rely on the Mysterious Female.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Cinnabar is mercury; golden nectar is lead. When metal returns to its nature, it is called the Reverted Elixir. Originally, it is but the primordial qi, born in the Cavern of Creation’s spring, hence named quicksilver. Without this single treasure, how could the elixir be formed? And without the Mysterious Female as its root, how could it enter and exit, transforming?\n\n*Within the male, the female’s essence is contained;*\n*Embracing yin, it holds fast to yang’s essence.*\n*When the two harmonize, the medicine is complete—*\n*It transmutes the soul’s spirit and the spirit’s soul.*\n\n*Trust in the single grain of golden elixir:*\n*Let the serpent swallow it, and it becomes a dragon.*\n*Let the chicken peck it, and it transforms into a phoenix,*\n*Soaring into the pure realm of True Yang.*\n\nDaoguang said: The male containing the female is the dragon’s latent qi. Embracing yin and holding yang is the tiger’s latent qi. When the two unite, the numinous elixir forms. Swallowed into the belly, it transmutes the yang soul to dissolve the yin spirit. A single grain, no larger than a millet seed—whether a chicken pecks or a serpent swallows it, both become dragons and phoenixes. Such is the elixir’s divine power.\n\nZiye said: Within yang there is yin; within yin there is yang. When yin and yang unite, the soul’s spirit conceives the sacred. Master Shangyang said: Though I appear male outwardly, within I am female. Though I appear white outwardly, within I am black. Yet within that yin, it paradoxically embraces yang’s essence. Only by using yang to refine yin is the great medicine completed. All things that obtain this numinous medicine can transform—how much more so the perfected person?\n\n*When heaven and earth pass through closure and openness,*\n*Morning and evening must recognize the signs of Layering and Sprouting.*\n*Like spokes converging at the hub, like rivers flowing to the sea—*\n*The wonder lies in the art of withdrawal and addition.*\n\n*Attain the One, and all things are complete.*\n*Do not divide north, south, east, or west.*\n*Lessen and lessen again—guard your prior work.*\n*The life-treasure must not be trifled with.*\n\nDaoguang said: At the beginning of firing, labor at the signs of Layering and Sprouting, but rest when the work is nearly done. Day and night, move the tally of fire into the crucible, like a wheel’s spokes converging at the hub, like the hundred rivers flowing to the sea. In such withdrawal and addition lies the essence of the True One’s qi. The One qi generates yin and yang; yin and yang generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Five Agents; the Five Agents generate the myriad things—all are transformations of the True One’s qi.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the essence of the True One is the parent of Heaven and Earth, the ancestor of yin and yang, the origin of the Four Images, the root of the Five Agents, and the foundation of the myriad things. Attain this One, and all affairs are complete. Lessen and lessen again, only then can the wonder of the One be fully grasped.\n\nFor the One takes form through the movement of yin and yang’s fire. Once swallowed and returned to the Five Viscera, as before, circulate the yin tally and yang fire to guard prior work. Be vigilant against peril, cautious of danger; do not act lightly, lest the life-treasure, the mysterious pearl, be lost.\n\nZiye said: When yin and yang have merged, it is the time to apply the fire. The convergence of spokes at the hub is the work of obtaining the medicine. At this moment, the primordial chaos returns to the Great Ultimate. There is no need to divide the limits of north, south, east, or west—only to watch over the barriers. If the mind stirs even slightly, guard the prior work. Should one indulge in momentary ardor, the toil of days past is forgotten, and the great affair is abandoned. Thus, the Way must not be trifled with.\n\nShangyangzi said: Those who undertake great cultivation should reflect on the difficulty of learning the Dao and refining the elixir. This single grain of elixir is not easily obtained. Only after enduring countless hardships and toils is it attained. Once obtained, this life-treasure must be cherished even more—secluded in quietude, nurtured and tempered with care. To \"lessen and lessen again\" means to extinguish desire until desire is forgotten, to rouse effort until effort is forgotten. Before obtaining the elixir, practice the conduct of a true immortal. After obtaining the elixir, hold the mind of one who has attained nothing, so that all things become irrelevant, and no peril remains—until the work is complete, the fire sufficient, and vigilance may ease.\n\nAt the winter solstice, yang returns with the first light. Over thirty days, one yang line is added. In the moon’s cycle, the *Fu* hexagram appears at the new moon’s morning tide, and the *Qian* hexagram ends at the full moon’s *Gou* omen. The day further divides into cold and heat: yang revives at midnight, and at noon, the *Gou* hexagram’s single yin arises. In refining the medicine, one must know dawn and dusk.\n\nDaoguang said: At the winter solstice, yang is born, forming the *Fu* hexagram. After thirty days, another yang line is added, becoming *Lin*, *Tai*, *Dazhuang*, and *Guai*. By the fourth month, six yang lines form pure *Qian*, the time of yang fire. When yang reaches its peak, yin is born. At the summer solstice, yin is born, forming the *Gou* hexagram. Over thirty days, one yin line is added, becoming *Dun*, *Pi*, *Guan*, and *Bo*. By the tenth month, six yin lines form pure *Kun*, the time of the yin tally. When yin reaches its peak, yang is reborn. This cycle repeats endlessly—such is the fire timing of a year. The sages condensed a year’s fire timing into a single month: at the new moon, the *Fu* hexagram appears, and every two and a half days, a yang line is added, until the fifteenth day, when pure *Qian* is formed. On the sixteenth day, yin is born, forming *Gou*. They further condensed a year’s timing into a single day, dividing it into cold and heat, yin and yang, warmth and coolness—the four seasonal qi. Thus, at midnight, the *Fu* hexagram’s yang is born, and at noon, the *Gou* hexagram’s yin arises. The yang fire and yin tally follow the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s yin-yang ascent and descent.\n\nZiye said: The return of the first yang at the winter solstice is like the time when the medicine is born within the body. At the end of a month, this qi is observed—hence the saying \"thirty days.\" The addition of one yang line is the *Fu* hexagram within the month. From *Fu* to *Qian*, when *Qian* is full, *Gou* follows—this is the time when the medicine has passed. The golden meets the distant full moon’s omen. The day further divides into cold and heat, marking the qi timing of refining the medicine within a day. Midnight is *Fu*, noon is *Gou*. Those who refine the medicine must clearly know the time of the heart’s single yang and the time of Heaven and Earth’s single yang, without the slightest error—only then can the golden elixir be hoped for.\n\nShangyangzi said: The tidal timing of the winter solstice is the work of Heaven and Earth’s creation. When lead sees *gui* born, it is the work of the human body’s creation. As Heaven and Earth’s yang revives and the myriad things take form, the true lead appears when the body’s yang is born. If not gathered and refined at this time, the moment passes, the medicine becomes turbid, and the substance is not true. Once this single grain of elixir is obtained and the true mercury is harmonized with oneself to form *Qian*, the yang fire is applied. *Gou* and *Xun* receive the yin tally, and the daily circulation of one’s mercury solidifies the yang essence—hence *Gou*, symbolizing the arrival of a single yin. Here, oral transmission is required. Without discerning the Five Agents and Four Images, how can one distinguish cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver? If the fire timing of elixir refinement has never been heard of, one may prematurely claim seclusion. Unwilling to reflect on one’s own errors, one instead teaches mistaken paths to others, leading them astray into eternal delusion. To resent and deceive with such a heart—how can one bear it?\n\nDaoguang said: Though there are ten thousand volumes of elixir classics, the wonder lies in the *Cantong Qi* and the *Song of the Tripod*. The achievement of the golden elixir is beyond the understanding of scholars in this world. If by chance a foolish teacher points to heterodox paths, one may entertain thoughts of escape or omission. Before learning the method of exhaling the old and inhaling the new, one may boast of soaring clouds and misty flights—self-aggrandizing, modeling oneself for others. Without repentance for one’s own ignorance, one misleads others into the depths of delusion. Such heartlessness and misconduct invite dire retribution. Moreover, to slander earlier texts and fabricate discussions—how can one bear such cruelty?\n\nZiye said: As the saying goes, \"Those above the middle can be spoken to of higher things; those below the middle cannot be spoken to of higher things.\"",

      "translated_text": "Master Shangyang said: Lead, mercury, cinnabar, silver, and earth constitute the Five Agents of the Reverted Elixir. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li form the Four Images of creation and transformation. Fire, as an element, is most extraordinary and numinous—it laughs at the burning of firewood to foretell a guest’s arrival, and at night it testifies to the blossoming of flowers to augur wealth and joy. If even ordinary fire possesses such qualities, true fire is all the more spiritually efficacious. Thus, it gives life to beings and to immortals, its power rivaling that of creation itself.\n\nYet because foolish disciples have not encountered a true master, they remain unaware of the Way of the Reverted Elixir. Instead, they rely on empty nihilism, reckless eloquence, and deceitful sophistry to mislead their contemporaries. Having strayed so far, they refuse to reflect on their misconduct or concern themselves with the consequences of sin and blessing. Since receiving my master’s instruction, whenever I encounter such people, I wish to admonish them and guide them back to the correct path. Yet those of shallow understanding are stubborn and difficult to teach.\n\nAlas! Master Zhuang spoke truly when he said, *\"Those whom Heaven would mutilate.\"* Virtue cultivated surpasses eight hundred deeds; hidden merits accumulate to three thousand. Only when one equalizes self and others, kin and foe, does one fulfill the original vow of the immortals. Tigers, rhinoceroses, blades, and weapons cannot harm them; the inescapable fire of impermanence cannot bind them. Once the sacred talisman descends, they ascend to Heaven, securely riding the phoenix chariot and the simurgh carriage.\n\nMaster Daoguang said: After nine years of embracing the One, merit is fulfilled and work complete. Self and others are both forgotten—what fear remains of blades, weapons, tigers, or rhinoceroses? The sacred talisman descends from Heaven, and the body soars to the Jade Palace. This is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name established.\n\nZiye said: At first, one acts; now, one enters non-action. The realm of non-action is where true immortals dwell.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Those who cultivate the Way must constantly refine their virtue and accumulate hidden merits. No matter how many demonic obstacles arise, they remain devoted to their practice. With such a resolve, even long-standing enmities naturally dissolve—how could blades, weapons, tigers, or rhinoceroses harm them? On the day their work is complete, they await the celestial melody and ascend in broad daylight. Masters like Zhang Daoling, Xu Jingyang, and Ge Xianweng all ascended to Heaven in daylight after achieving the Dao. Yet people today claim that immortals are born from seeds sown in past lives, cultivated over eons, and that their attainment is beyond human reach—how grievously they misunderstand! Did they not know that Ge Xian attained the Dao only after the age of sixty? His actions were beyond confusion, and only then did he succeed.\n\nAlas! Laozi said: *\"The good scholars of old were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating, so deep as to be unknowable.\"* How wondrous! This unknowable depth refers to the time of refining the Great Elixir, when one practices the Way of action. Precisely because it is so deep and unknowable, one’s deeds surpass eight hundred and one’s merits reach three thousand.\n\nA *West River Moon* lyric, symbolizing the intercalary month:\nThe Elixir is the supreme treasure of the physical form,\nRefined, it transforms endlessly.\nFurther, one investigates the true essence of nature,\nMastering the wondrous function of non-birth.\nNo need to wait for future lives—\nBefore one’s eyes, one attains the Buddha’s spiritual powers.\nSince the Dragon Girl applied this work,\nWho since has followed in her footsteps?\n\nMaster Daoguang said: This Way is precisely the intent behind Bodhidharma’s coming from the West. It has been transmitted from patriarch to patriarch. Thus, the Sixth Patriarch emerged from the lineage of Cao and Han, and Mazu referred to it as the *\"Water of the West River\"*—all pointing to this same truth. Yet later generations, lacking the heart to practice, merely discuss it with their mouths. The Buddhas and patriarchs, powerless to do otherwise, resort to staffs, blows, shouts, and a hundred metaphors to guide those of superior capacity to practice the Way, those of middling capacity to awaken to their nature, and those of lesser capacity to remember their words.\n\nWhat I seek is for people first to preserve their nature, then to cultivate life and preserve nature—this is the work of refining the Jade Liquid and tempering the self. Cultivating life is the Way of the Golden Liquid’s Reverted Elixir. Fools, however, claim that in my teaching, a single word from the Chan school instantly awakens one to Buddhahood. This is deceptive nonsense—how could such a thing be? Know this: the Golden Elixir is the supreme and wondrous vehicle of my teaching.\n\nZiye said: *\"The Elixir is the supreme treasure of the physical form\"*—this single phrase exhausts the essence of the Great Elixir. What need is there for more?\n\nMaster Shangyang said: The Tathāgata’s wondrous physical form arises from the ordinary physical form of the world. Thus, the supreme treasure of the Golden Elixir is not found in remote mountains or desolate valleys but is sought within the dharmas of the world. Once this Elixir is achieved, its transformations are boundless. First, one must thoroughly investigate one’s own nature before becoming a child of the Buddha and proceeding to higher matters.\n\nThus, Master Daoguang said: *\"Refining nature is tempering the self; cultivating life is the Reverted Elixir.\"* This is not about cultivating blessings for future lives but about attaining Buddhahood in this very existence. Once, when the World-Honored One expounded the Dharma on Vulture Peak, five thousand left their seats, yet the Dragon Girl, presenting a precious pearl before the World-Honored One, attained Buddhahood.\n\nFive quatrains, symbolizing the Five Agents of lead, mercury, cinnabar, silver, and earth:\nThough you comprehend the true suchness of nature,\nYou cannot escape casting off this body only to enter another.\nWhy then undertake the refinement of the Great Medicine?\nTo swiftly transcend the leakless and become a true person.\n\nMaster Daoguang said: In the Dharma gate of the Tathāgata, awakening to nature comes first, yet this is not the supreme wondrous meaning. In the Way of the Golden Elixir, obtaining the Medicine is paramount, but one must first refine nature. To regard awakening to nature as sufficient is utterly mistaken. To seek the Medicine without refining nature risks peril.\n\nZiye said: The *Book of Changes* states: *\"Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, to reach destiny.\"* This is what it means to cultivate both nature and life—this is the Way of one yin and one yang. If one only awakens to nature without completing life, this is the illness of partial yin and partial yang, leading to the affliction of casting off this body only to enter another.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: People today do not understand why later immortals often cite the teachings of Śākyamuni—to urge the necessity of cultivating both nature and life. Instead, they slander them, claiming that after achieving the Dao, one must still study Buddhism. How deluded they are! Those who comprehend the true suchness of nature yet do not refine the Elixir cannot become Buddhas.",

Without repentance for one’s own ignorance, one misleads others into the depths of delusion. Such heartlessness and misconduct invite dire retribution. Moreover, to slander earlier texts and fabricate discussions—how can one bear such cruelty?\n\nZiye said: As the saying goes, \"Those above the middle can be spoken to of higher things; those below the middle cannot be spoken to of higher things.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the preface states: The method of breath retention closely resembles seated meditation. If practiced diligently, it may lead to samādhi and spirit departure. Yet since spirit belongs to yin and its dwelling is difficult to secure, one must perpetually employ the method of relocation—without attaining the Way of returning mercury and gold, how could one reverse yang and transform the bones to ascend in broad daylight? Those who cast off this body only to enter another cannot escape leakage.\n\nThe Way of refining life that directly enters the formless Great Medicine is the true cultivation of life. Cultivating both nature and life, form and spirit attain wondrous union. Rebirth, possession, relocation, and former dwelling—these are but the four fruitless paths. Should one master the taming of the dragon and the subduing of the tiger, how long would the house of true gold ever wither?\n\nDaoguang said: Rebirth and possession are the paths of those clinging to emptiness. Taming the dragon and subduing the tiger are the marvels of the Returned Elixir.\n\nZiye said: The Way of the Golden Elixir, once attained, is eternally secure. A body exists beyond the body, hidden and revealed beyond measure—unlike the rebirth, possession, or obstinate emptiness of lesser practitioners.\n\nShangyang said: The four fruits refer to *srotaāpanna*, *sakṛdāgāmin*, *anāgāmin*, and *arhat*. Rebirth and possession, as when the Fifth Patriarch entered the womb of Lady Zhou, may yet allow for cultivation in the next life, for one retains the thread of the Dao and does not lose awareness. But should one lose the human form even once, ten thousand kalpas of saṃsāra await.\n\nThe method of inspecting form, holding breath, and contemplating spirit begins with hardship but later becomes smooth. Though one may swiftly traverse ten thousand lands, alas, the old house must still be relocated.\n\nDaoguang said: All these practices are but side doors of Daoist teachings. Following them, one cannot behold the Tathāgata.\n\nZiye said: These words describe the method of the yin spirit, which suffers the affliction of relocating the old house—unlike the Way of the yang spirit and the Golden Elixir.\n\nShangyang said: Breath retention and breath cultivation are but a single yin. Even after ten thousand kalpas, one ultimately falls into emptiness and annihilation—this is not the Way.\n\n*The Biography of Lü Dongbin* records: One day, Dongbin transformed into a Daoist and wandered to the Kaixian Temple on Mount Lu, where he saw the monk Fazhen seated in meditation for two seven-day periods, his precepts and conduct exemplary. The Daoist asked: \"Can seated meditation complete the Way?\"\n\nFazhen replied: \"Yes.\"\n\nThe Daoist said: \"The Buddha’s precepts deem greed, anger, and delusion most grave. When you sit, you claim to have no mind, yet when you encounter things, you cannot forget them even briefly. Should attachment arise, the four afflictions surge uncontrollably. If you wish to sit upright, first refine the mind. Once the mind is refined, subdue the qi. Once qi is subdued, though you sleep all day, the Way is within—how could it depend solely on sitting?\"\n\nFazhen had yet to awaken. The Daoist then led him through the meditation hall, where they saw a monk fast asleep. The Daoist asked Fazhen: \"What does this monk usually do?\"\n\nFazhen said: \"He sits to accumulate merit, to perfect Buddhahood.\"\n\nThe Daoist said: \"Sit here for a moment, and observe this monk’s seated practice.\" After a long while, Fazhen saw a small red snake, over three inches long, emerge from the crown of the sleeping monk’s head. It slithered down the bed’s left leg to the floor, roaming everywhere, eating his phlegm and saliva. Then it climbed into the chamber pot to drink before departing through the window. It crossed a small ditch, circled the flowers as if admiring them, then attempted to cross another ditch. Finding the water too high, it turned back. The Daoist, anticipating its return, planted a small knife in its path. The snake recoiled in fear, found another route, and reached the bed’s right leg, ascending back into the monk’s crown.\n\nThe sleeping monk suddenly awoke and addressed the Daoist and Fazhen: \"I just had a dream. Let me tell you both. First, I exited through the left gate and encountered an exquisite vegetarian feast, which I ate. Then I came upon fine wine and drank it. Lifting my robe, I tried to cross a small river outside the gate, but the water suddenly rose, preventing me. I turned back and encountered a bandit who tried to kill me. I fled by a shortcut and reentered through the right gate—then I awoke.\"\n\nThe Daoist and Fazhen laughed heartily and departed, telling Fazhen: \"The bed’s legs were the gates, phlegm and saliva the feast, urine the wine, the ditch the river, the flowers and trees the beautiful women, and the blade the bandit. Human dreams and illusions are as false as this—can one truly attain Buddhahood through sitting?\"\n\nFazhen asked: \"What was the snake?\"\n\nThe Daoist replied: \"This monk’s nature is often filled with anger, which has transformed and manifested as a snake. One day, when he closes his eyes in death, he will be reborn as a snake. Should he not fear this?\"",

      "translated_text": "Dao Guang said: \"True lead and true mercury are not apart from daily practice. If one inverts and cultivates them, the entire earth becomes supreme treasure.\"\n\nZiye said: \"The mechanism of inversion has been fully revealed in the preceding scroll. Is there no jade within the stone? It awaits one who knows its worth.\"\n\nShangyangzi said: \"The Dao is present in daily conduct.\" The ancient sages declared: *\"Day and night are as one in practice.\"* Those who engage in great cultivation must seek diligently within it, pondering and discussing its depths. Only when a true master points out the workings of creation does one realize that even dust and sand may become treasure.\n\n*Commentary on the Third Scroll of the \"Awakening to Reality\" of the Perfected Purple Yang concludes.*\n\n**Postscript by the Perfected Purple Yang**\n\nNow, human life arises from delusive attachments that give form to the self. With self comes suffering; without self, whence would suffering arise? To escape suffering, nothing surpasses embodying the supreme Dao. To embody the supreme Dao, nothing surpasses illuminating the original mind.\n\nThus, the mind is the essence of the Dao, and the Dao is the function of the mind. If one can examine the mind and observe the nature, the luminous essence will naturally manifest, and the effortless function will naturally unfold. Without exerting effort, one instantly transcends to the other shore. How could this be achieved unless the mind-mirror shines clearly and the spirit-pearl radiates brilliance, such that all phenomena instantly dissolve, not a speck of dust adheres, and the source of mind remains free—utterly beyond birth?\n\nYet for those who illuminate the mind and embody the Dao, the body cannot burden their nature, nor can circumstances disturb their reality. How then could blades or weapons harm them? How could tigers or rhinoceroses endanger them? How could great fires or floods cause concern? The enlightened one’s mind is like a bright mirror: it reflects but does not retain, responds to circumstances but does not initiate. Thus, they overcome phenomena without injury.\n\nThis is the wondrous Dao of the supreme and perfect truth. Originally, the Dao had no name—sages imposed one. Originally, the Dao had no words—sages spoke them. Yet if names and words were silenced, later generations would have no means to recognize its essence and return to reality. Therefore, sages established teachings and set forth words to reveal the Dao. Thus, the Dao is made manifest through words, and words are forgotten in return to the Dao.\n\nAlas, this Dao is most wondrous and subtle, yet the world’s people, dull in root-nature, cling to the existence of the body, loathing death and delighting in life. Thus, they ultimately struggle to awaken. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, pitying their attachments, employed the arts of cultivating life to align with their desires, guiding them gradually. Since the essence of cultivating life lies in the Golden Elixir, and the essence of the Golden Elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond, the teachings of the *Dao De Jing* and *Yin Fu Jing* flourished in the world—because people delight in life.\n\nYet their words are veiled and their principles profound.

      "translated_text": "How rare it is that among scholars as numerous as ox hairs, those who truly comprehend are as scarce as unicorn horns. In the year *jiyou* of the previous cycle, I, Boduan, encountered a master in Chengdu who transmitted the method of the Elixir. That very year, my patron passed away, and thereafter, whenever I transmitted the teachings to others, disaster struck within half a month—three times in all. Recently, I recalled my master’s warning: *\"One day, if someone comes to free you from your bonds, you may transmit the teachings to them; otherwise, you are not permitted.\"* Later, wishing to sever my name from the registers of the mundane world, yet fearing that people would not believe in this Way, I composed this *Awakening to Reality*, setting forth the origins and culmination of the Elixir Medicine.\n\nOnce completed, seekers arrived in droves, their intentions earnest upon reading it. Unable to bear their eagerness, I selected a few to instruct. Yet those I taught possessed neither great influence nor strength, nor the capacity to uphold peril or rescue the drowning, nor the boldness to transcend convention, nor the benevolence to illuminate the Dao. After the first two misfortunes, my heart remained oblivious; only after the third did I awaken to my past errors. Thus I know: the Great Elixir’s method is utterly simple and effortless. Even the dullest and most ignorant, if they practice it, may instantly ascend to the realm of sages. Therefore, Heaven guards it in secrecy, forbidding its reckless transmission to the unworthy. Yet I, Boduan, disregarded my master’s words and repeatedly divulged Heaven’s mysteries. Because of this bodily existence, I have suffered repeated calamities—so swift and divine is Heaven’s admonition. How dare I not tremble with fear and reproach myself?\n\nFrom this day forward, I shall seal my lips and bind my tongue. Even if cauldrons boil before me and blades press upon my neck, I shall never speak of it again. Within this *Awakening to Reality*, the songs and verses on the Great Elixir, its medicines, and the subtleties of the firing times are all exhaustively set forth. Those with a predisposition for the immortal arts, upon reading it, will find their wisdom and discernment naturally clarified. They may follow the text to grasp its meaning—what need is there for my humble oral transmission? In this way, it is Heaven’s gift, not my presumptuous dissemination.\n\nAs for the songs and eulogies at the end of the work, they expound the method of seeing one’s nature—this is the very \"wondrous awakening of non-doing\" spoken of above. Yet the Way of non-doing takes equanimity as its heart; though it reveals profound secrets, it ultimately bears no fault. Alas, ordinary beings differ in the depth of their karmic obstructions and the sharpness of their innate capacities. Though they hear the same teaching, their interpretations diverge wildly. Thus, the Dharma treasures expounded by Śākyamuni and Mañjuśrī are none other than the One Vehicle, yet listeners, according to their faculties, naturally form the distinctions of the Three Vehicles.\n\nIf, hereafter, a person of keen and swift nature encounters this work, they will recognize that Boduan has grasped the supreme, wondrous essence of the Mahāyāna as transmitted by Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch. Through a single phrase, they may awaken to the myriad dharmas. But if residual habits persist, they may revert to middling or lesser views—this is not Boduan’s fault.\n\nWritten on the day *wuyin* of the month *wuyin* in the first year of the *Yuanfeng* reign, *wuwu* cycle, by Zhang Boduan, styled Pingshu, of Tiantai, in his second preface.",
