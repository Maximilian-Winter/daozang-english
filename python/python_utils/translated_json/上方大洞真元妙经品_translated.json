  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern of True Primordial Wondrous Scripture, Chapter**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern of True Primordial Wondrous Scripture, Chapter*. Author unknown. Two scriptures bound in one volume. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Category of Sacred Diagrams*.\n\n**Imperial Preface by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang**\nI have heard that within the boundless expanse, does the True Lord abide? At the dawn of primordial chaos, the sagely ones perceived its blessings. Its teachings bestow goodness without possession; its Dao is daily employed yet ever renewed. Thus, the radiant cloud-script of immortal writ and the secret jade tablets of sacred verse—without grasping the diagrams and receiving the registers, none may practice its teachings. Without those who dwell in truth and abide in mystery, none may glimpse its texts.\n\nThe statutes of illuminating truth were left by the Most High as a testament. The work of delivering beings is to return to the Great Dao. Here, the True Primordial Sage Lord, the Supreme Cavern of Opening Transformation and Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, resides in the heaven of unified qi transformation, the Nine Purity’s realm of spontaneity. His jade-green palaces and purple halls stand in splendor; he ascends the Thousand Radiance Cloud Palace and mounts the Seven Jeweled Throne. Gazing upon the mortal world, he sees its lofty plans neglected.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed the teachings and commanded the assembly of perfected immortals to transmit the scriptures and transform humanity. Those who recite them tread the domain of the Heavenly Worthy; those who practice them wander the homeland of the Most High. Thus, the *Dongxuan Lingbao Scripture of the Celestial Gate of the Most High* states: The Jade Clarity August Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Realm, manifesting in a form of pure lightness, dons the raiment of the azure vault. He governs the growth and decay of spring, summer, autumn, and winter; he oversees the flourishing and withering of ruler and minister, father and child. He presides over the length of cultivation for immortals and mortals across the Three Realms, the waxing and waning of fortune and misfortune. Thus, his form and countenance are depicted in diagrams, that the people of the world may submit to his command, believe in his rites, and seek longevity—such is the reverence due him.\n\nI have heard that in praising the Supreme Heavenly Worthy, the repentance texts are most solemn. Utterly sagely, utterly true, he emerges from the Five Realms beyond the Three Nets. Without top or bottom, the Eight Directions pay homage to his Seven Jeweled Palace. He governs the primordial heaven of the Yellow Center and stabilizes the earthly pole of the Central Axis. His majestic radiance shines resplendently; his divine virtue towers sublimely. Sincere invocation moves him to respond; utmost devotion meets with blessed answer. Those who reverently recite and believe in him gain fortune in life; those who offer incense and flowers ascend to heaven after death. May all who take refuge attain the fruit of the Dao together.\n\n**The Supreme Cavern of True Primordial Wondrous Scripture, Chapter**\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Illuminating Transformation, in the land of proclaiming the teachings, addressed the Primordial Purity and Void Perfected One, along with the assembly of those ever-good at delivering beings, saying: Long ago, in the heavens of the Ten Poles and the palace of the Five Clarities, I heard the former sages expound that the Great Cavern of True Primordium—profound, empty, and obscure—naturally vast, gives birth to the One Simplicity, which generates spirit, and the Nine Yangs, which transform qi.\n\nHow august is the Supreme Dao! How luminous is the Primal Lord! He arrayed the Three Powers and harmoniously perfected the myriad kinds. The true primordial essence, in accord with the turning of the seasons, nurtures and sustains growth. Thus, the Dao treats humanity as its vessel, and humanity employs the Dao as its function. Therefore, the sagely ones who transform the world model themselves on the lofty and bright. Through long practice of stillness, they constantly refine their qi. They strive to harmonize ascent and descent, regulate balance, and ensure the tranquility of essence and flavor. The feminine One is nurtured in wondrous being; the masculine One is received from true non-being. Cold and heat, warmth and frost follow the lunar decrees of frugality. They emulate the ancestral principles of enduring the year’s length, ever employing the Dao of daily renewal.\n\nOne should first correct transgressions and practice filial piety and fraternal duty; next, cultivate reverence and respect, advancing in mysterious merit. Serve the master and follow the Dao, illuminating the Three that become One. With inherent brightness, one’s nature shines without possession; the qi of the Dao is transmitted and perpetuated. Yielding and compliant, one follows the four seasons’ transformations; assisting and supporting, one aids the hundred clans in their self-governance, all proceeding in harmonious accord. The knights of the realm who honor their lord and parents—these achieve the highest accomplishment. Those who follow Heaven’s mandate, secure their allotted place, accumulate merit and conduct, and cultivate their bodies—these achieve the middle accomplishment. Those who establish teachings, transmit scriptures to deliver beings, return to the origin and know cessation, or dwell in reclusion amidst the marketplace—these achieve completion in the end. When all three are fully realized, how could one fail to attain the True Primordium?\n\nThe great transformation of the True Primordium arises from one’s own actions. In resolve, be pure; in affairs, be magnanimous. Conceal what can be named; embrace the pure qi. This is most worthy of reverence—proceeding step by step, advancing like the Dao. The profundity of the two virtues of Dao and virtue restores the source of the Great Beginning. The excellence of the Five Constants serves as a model; it rescues the exhaustion of the ultimate end. Internally and externally, adapt to the times, ever advancing in mutual accord. How could one not reflect upon these two? Without the teachings of the True Primordium, how could one attain them?\n\nThus, awaiting fortune’s arrival, one may obtain the Dao of longevity. Those who act contrary to this will meet with no good end. Having spoken, the Emperor ascended to heaven. Thereupon, the Perfected One announced to the heavenly and mortal beings: All who advance in honoring the Dao must first resolve obstacles. To fulfill vows and dispel calamities, one may recite the Ten Titles:\n\nThey are: Supreme Scripture Master Lord, Heavenly Immortal Lord, True Primordial Teaching Master, Spontaneous Dharma King, Vast Dao Supreme Emperor, Opening Transformation Most High, Supreme Cavern of Universal Compassion and Salvation from Suffering Heavenly Worthy, Supreme Cavern of Jade Clarity August Heavenly Worthy, Supreme Cavern of Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, Supreme Cavern of Boundless Most High Dao and Virtue Heavenly Worthy.\n\nThese revered titles are recorded in the annals of transformation. They are the records of immortals receiving the master’s teachings and the scriptures of the good practicing the Dao. Through reverent recitation and devotion, one gains blessings in life; through offerings of incense and flowers, the departed ascend and advance. By the power of their merit and virtue, they can eliminate disasters, cure illnesses, rescue from suffering, eradicate sins, protect life, and subdue demons. Such is the Dao—it shall be practiced.\n\nThe assembly of immortals, having received the teachings, rejoiced. The Most High delivered his instructions, and they composed a gatha:\n\nLuminous are the sagely decrees of the August One!\nVast is the Dao of harmonious emptiness!\nDelivering beings and benefiting all,\nWe praise the master’s profound mysteries.\n\nHaving heard these teachings, they shall endure forever.\n\nThe *Dongzhen Jing* states in its original harmony: Since the earliest ages, within the *Xuan Du Daozang Jing*, there have been texts that expound the wondrous and attain the sagely—scriptures that meet the celestial treasures, forming the mysteries of the immortals’ tradition. Yet their language is concise and their secrets profound. They are the pivot of the Three Tombs and the essence of the Seven Divisions.\n\nThis scripture resembles the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger*, concealed within the *Jinbi Jing*. The Three Caverns—*Dongzhen*, *Dongxuan*, and *Dongshen*—comprise the Three Caverns’ divisions. The Four Auxiliary Canons—*Taixuan*, *Taiping*, *Taiqing*, and *Zhengyi*—together form the Seven Divisions of scriptures.\n\nThe books of Fuxi are the *Yi*, those of Shennong the *Bencao*, and those of the Yellow Emperor the *Neijing*—these are the Three Tombs. They speak of the Great Dao. The essentials of the Three Tombs and Seven Divisions have been transmitted by the ancient sages for ages. Such are the *Xuantong Daode Jing*, the writings of Left Mystery Perfected Lord Guan Yinzi, the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* of Wenzi, the *Dongling Zhenjing* of Kang Cangzi, the *Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing* of Liezi, and the *Nanhua Zhenjing* of Zhuangzi. These are the achievements of those who daily renew the Dao, striving to comprehend and embody it.\n\nThus, the principles are complete—how could they not be deemed the profound mystery of the Double Mystery? To abandon these and seek understanding elsewhere—how could that be so? To grasp the meaning of the scriptures is to fully embrace this discourse.\n\nFrom the ancestral transmission, receiving the celestial *Xuangao*, none dare fail in reverence, honoring the command of the Most High. Once, in a dream shared among sleepers, a divine journey unfolded. The Purple Void Perfected descended to instruct, guiding toward virtuous transformation. I have heard the words of the former masters: the Great Dao is non-action, giving life and nurturing, maturing and ripening, its spiritual transformations arising naturally.\n\nThus, the sage acts, sowing and planting, nourishing and harvesting. Through careful application of wisdom and effort, one adapts to the needs of things, preparing for the times ahead. Nurturing form and spirit in tranquil stillness, one may approach the true origin amid the formless. The supreme Dao is the parent of all transformations. The vast and harmonious qi is the master of the body.\n\nTherefore, the unfathomable workings of yin and yang are called the numinous; the perfection of virtue and conduct is called immortality. Those who pursue wealth, honor, longevity, rich flavors, colors, and sounds are few in human authority. Those who embrace emptiness, tranquility, and non-action know the ultimate joy of Heaven.\n\nTo comprehend Heaven and Earth’s preferences, to discern the dispositions of beings—this is the mark of the spiritually enlightened. Profound stillness and clarity are called purity; peace and serenity are called quiescence. The Dao’s essence is to give life to the myriad spirits without exhaustion. Its function for humanity is to harmonize the Three Palaces and remain free from disturbance.\n\nThe repeated verification of its teachings is the marvel of the ancient sages. The great principles of delivering beings are the scriptures of the present masters. The *Shangfang Dadong Jing* reveals the unfolding of Heaven’s guidance, the luminous mystery of wondrous being, and the primordial qi of true non-being. Thus, life succeeds life, renewal knows no end.\n\n**Divine Responses of the Immortals’ Scriptures**\nThe Master of Green Clouds says: The human body grows, qi flourishes, then declines and perishes—such is the mandate of time, the natural course. Those who respond with virtuous power meet good fortune; those who violate virtue and lose its power encounter misfortune—this is the way of virtue’s reward.\n\nTo attain the Dao of the true origin is to embody goodness, aligning with the hearts of Heaven and humanity. If one diligently cultivates reverence, on the third day of the third lunar month—the festival of the True Origin Immortals—one may burn incense and recite the *True Origin Scripture* one hundred times, offering ten thousand strings of spirit money for the deceased. Upon reciting ten thousand times, one may liberate three generations from karmic debts and grievances, and summon the hosts of celestial immortals and divine soldiers to ensure lasting protection and blessings free from calamity.\n\nReciting nine thousand times brings extended life and increased fortune, averting premature death. Seven thousand recitations bring wealth, honor, and wisdom, preventing poverty and low status. Five thousand recitations bring peace, prosperity, and auspicious joy. Three thousand recitations allow one to take refuge in the treasures of the Dao, the scriptures, and the revered masters, avoiding the perils of slaughter, water, and fire.\n\nOne thousand recitations dispel illness and weakness, banishing fear. One thousand recitations bring a light and healthy body, free from ugliness. One thousand recitations remit sins, dissolve transgressions, resolve misfortune, and attract blessings, averting evil destinies and all disasters. One thousand recitations ensure longevity, the ascent of the spirit to the upper realms, audience with the lofty Perfected, and carefree joy.\n\nThus, inscribing jade talismans for disaster relief and wearing them invokes the compassion of the sagely Dao. After death, one bypasses the underworld and ascends to the Grand Tenuity Heaven, paying homage to the Merciful Honored One. The Merciful Honored One bestows great blessings, guiding the people to the immortal realms, sparing them from the dark abyss.\n\nEven those who transgress may be redeemed. Through these teachings, they are awakened and admonished in the transformation of the true origin. If one heeds the instructions, on the festival of the Sagely King of Immortals, one may inscribe jade talismans in cinnabar, wear them to dissolve the six extremes of Earth, or swallow them to receive the five blessings of Heaven. How could such talismans not be revered?\n\nThis scripture is the great Dao—trust in it, and that is all. **Postscript.**\n\nAt that time, the Master wandered freely and deliberated with the Feathered Transcendents of the Great Clarity, saying: The *Scripture of Transformative Enlightenment from On High* and the *Scripture of Extended Models* guide those who have just begun their practice on the initial ground. Next, the *Scripture of the True Origin* transforms and instructs those of middling rank who illuminate the mysteries. And beyond these, the *Scripture of the Great Cavern* serves as the ladder to transcendence, the royal path to attaining the true.\n\nThe *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Scripture of the Great Cavern* were jade-annotated by the Dao Lord, their subtleties difficult to fathom. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm expounded and disseminated these scriptures and transmissions in the world, solely for the deliverance of humanity.\n\nThe essential meaning of the original scripture, as spoken by the ancient sages, concerns the inner and outer aspects of the Dao for humankind. Inwardly, when one is quiescent, one circulates the qi of harmonious equilibrium, first advancing virtue, power, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual propriety—then clarity arises. With clarity comes few desires; with few desires, what can one not do, and what need one do? Outwardly, when one acts, one proceeds from a heart of gentleness and humility, next relinquishing fear, anger, joy, thought, and sorrow—then rectitude arises. With rectitude comes the knowledge of when to stop; with such knowledge, there is nothing permissible and nothing impermissible.\n\nThereafter, the four limbs are enlivened, and the three primacies are preserved. Thus may one avoid harm, protect the body, and fulfill one’s allotted lifespan, returning to the true abode. Truly, these are excellent words—one must not forget them. This is the Way of the True Origin, the boundless Dao.\n\nThe humble and unworthy disciples of the Wandering Gate dare not inscribe their names but have commissioned artisans to carve and print this text, wishing to repay the profound kindness of the sagely lords of heaven and earth and the stars, as well as that of parents and teachers. It is hoped that those of lofty attainment will awaken a reverent heart, broadly propagate these teachings, and encourage goodness, that all may ascend together to the immortal realms.\n\nIn stillness, one receives virtue and treads the primal Dao. **Here concludes the *Wondrous Scripture of the True Origin of the Great Cavern from On High*.**",

      "translated_text": "Having heard these teachings, they shall endure forever.\n\nThe *Dongzhen Jing* states in its original harmony: Since the earliest ages, within the *Xuan Du Daozang Jing*, there have been texts that expound the wondrous and attain the sagely—scriptures that meet the celestial treasures, forming the mysteries of the immortals’ tradition. Yet their language is concise and their secrets profound. They are the pivot of the Three Tombs and the essence of the Seven Divisions.\n\nThis scripture resembles the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger*, concealed within the *Jinbi Jing*. The Three Caverns—*Dongzhen*, *Dongxuan*, and *Dongshen*—comprise the Three Caverns’ divisions. The Four Auxiliary Canons—*Taixuan*, *Taiping*, *Taiqing*, and *Zhengyi*—together form the Seven Divisions of scriptures.\n\nThe books of Fuxi are the *Yi*, those of Shennong the *Bencao*, and those of the Yellow Emperor the *Neijing*—these are the Three Tombs. They speak of the Great Dao. The essentials of the Three Tombs and Seven Divisions have been transmitted by the ancient sages for ages. Such are the *Xuantong Daode Jing*, the writings of Left Mystery Perfected Lord Guan Yinzi, the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* of Wenzi, the *Dongling Zhenjing* of Kang Cangzi, the *Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing* of Liezi, and the *Nanhua Zhenjing* of Zhuangzi. These are the achievements of those who daily renew the Dao, striving to comprehend and embody it.\n\nThus, the principles are complete—how could they not be deemed the profound mystery of the Double Mystery? To abandon these and seek understanding elsewhere—how could that be so? To grasp the meaning of the scriptures is to fully embrace this discourse.\n\nFrom the ancestral transmission, receiving the celestial *Xuangao*, none dare fail in reverence, honoring the command of the Most High. Once, in a dream shared among sleepers, a divine journey unfolded. The Purple Void Perfected descended to instruct, guiding toward virtuous transformation. I have heard the words of the former masters: the Great Dao is non-action, giving life and nurturing, maturing and ripening, its spiritual transformations arising naturally.\n\nThus, the sage acts, sowing and planting, nourishing and harvesting. Through careful application of wisdom and effort, one adapts to the needs of things, preparing for the times ahead. Nurturing form and spirit in tranquil stillness, one may approach the true origin amid the formless. The supreme Dao is the parent of all transformations. The vast and harmonious qi is the master of the body.\n\nTherefore, the unfathomable workings of yin and yang are called the numinous; the perfection of virtue and conduct is called immortality. Those who pursue wealth, honor, longevity, rich flavors, colors, and sounds are few in human authority. Those who embrace emptiness, tranquility, and non-action know the ultimate joy of Heaven.\n\nTo comprehend Heaven and Earth’s preferences, to discern the dispositions of beings—this is the mark of the spiritually enlightened. Profound stillness and clarity are called purity; peace and serenity are called quiescence. The Dao’s essence is to give life to the myriad spirits without exhaustion. Its function for humanity is to harmonize the Three Palaces and remain free from disturbance.\n\nThe repeated verification of its teachings is the marvel of the ancient sages. The great principles of delivering beings are the scriptures of the present masters. The *Shangfang Dadong Jing* reveals the unfolding of Heaven’s guidance, the luminous mystery of wondrous being, and the primordial qi of true non-being. Thus, life succeeds life, renewal knows no end.\n\n**Divine Responses of the Immortals’ Scriptures**\nThe Master of Green Clouds says: The human body grows, qi flourishes, then declines and perishes—such is the mandate of time, the natural course. Those who respond with virtuous power meet good fortune; those who violate virtue and lose its power encounter misfortune—this is the way of virtue’s reward.\n\nTo attain the Dao of the true origin is to embody goodness, aligning with the hearts of Heaven and humanity. If one diligently cultivates reverence, on the third day of the third lunar month—the festival of the True Origin Immortals—one may burn incense and recite the *True Origin Scripture* one hundred times, offering ten thousand strings of spirit money for the deceased. Upon reciting ten thousand times, one may liberate three generations from karmic debts and grievances, and summon the hosts of celestial immortals and divine soldiers to ensure lasting protection and blessings free from calamity.\n\nReciting nine thousand times brings extended life and increased fortune, averting premature death. Seven thousand recitations bring wealth, honor, and wisdom, preventing poverty and low status. Five thousand recitations bring peace, prosperity, and auspicious joy. Three thousand recitations allow one to take refuge in the treasures of the Dao, the scriptures, and the revered masters, avoiding the perils of slaughter, water, and fire.\n\nOne thousand recitations dispel illness and weakness, banishing fear. One thousand recitations bring a light and healthy body, free from ugliness. One thousand recitations remit sins, dissolve transgressions, resolve misfortune, and attract blessings, averting evil destinies and all disasters. One thousand recitations ensure longevity, the ascent of the spirit to the upper realms, audience with the lofty Perfected, and carefree joy.\n\nThus, inscribing jade talismans for disaster relief and wearing them invokes the compassion of the sagely Dao. After death, one bypasses the underworld and ascends to the Grand Tenuity Heaven, paying homage to the Merciful Honored One. The Merciful Honored One bestows great blessings, guiding the people to the immortal realms, sparing them from the dark abyss.\n\nEven those who transgress may be redeemed. Through these teachings, they are awakened and admonished in the transformation of the true origin. If one heeds the instructions, on the festival of the Sagely King of Immortals, one may inscribe jade talismans in cinnabar, wear them to dissolve the six extremes of Earth, or swallow them to receive the five blessings of Heaven. How could such talismans not be revered?\n\nThis scripture is the great Dao—trust in it, and that is all. **Postscript.**",

Such is the Dao—it shall be practiced.\n\nThe assembly of immortals, having received the teachings, rejoiced. The Most High delivered his instructions, and they composed a gatha:\n\nLuminous are the sagely decrees of the August One!\nVast is the Dao of harmonious emptiness!\nDelivering beings and benefiting all,\nWe praise the master’s profound mysteries.",

      "translated_text": "At that time, the Master wandered freely and deliberated with the Feathered Transcendents of the Great Clarity, saying: The *Scripture of Transformative Enlightenment from On High* and the *Scripture of Extended Models* guide those who have just begun their practice on the initial ground. Next, the *Scripture of the True Origin* transforms and instructs those of middling rank who illuminate the mysteries. And beyond these, the *Scripture of the Great Cavern* serves as the ladder to transcendence, the royal path to attaining the true.\n\nThe *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Scripture of the Great Cavern* were jade-annotated by the Dao Lord, their subtleties difficult to fathom. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm expounded and disseminated these scriptures and transmissions in the world, solely for the deliverance of humanity.\n\nThe essential meaning of the original scripture, as spoken by the ancient sages, concerns the inner and outer aspects of the Dao for humankind. Inwardly, when one is quiescent, one circulates the qi of harmonious equilibrium, first advancing virtue, power, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual propriety—then clarity arises. With clarity comes few desires; with few desires, what can one not do, and what need one do? Outwardly, when one acts, one proceeds from a heart of gentleness and humility, next relinquishing fear, anger, joy, thought, and sorrow—then rectitude arises. With rectitude comes the knowledge of when to stop; with such knowledge, there is nothing permissible and nothing impermissible.\n\nThereafter, the four limbs are enlivened, and the three primacies are preserved. Thus may one avoid harm, protect the body, and fulfill one’s allotted lifespan, returning to the true abode. Truly, these are excellent words—one must not forget them. This is the Way of the True Origin, the boundless Dao.\n\nThe humble and unworthy disciples of the Wandering Gate dare not inscribe their names but have commissioned artisans to carve and print this text, wishing to repay the profound kindness of the sagely lords of heaven and earth and the stars, as well as that of parents and teachers. It is hoped that those of lofty attainment will awaken a reverent heart, broadly propagate these teachings, and encourage goodness, that all may ascend together to the immortal realms.\n\nIn stillness, one receives virtue and treads the primal Dao. **Here concludes the *Wondrous Scripture of the True Origin of the Great Cavern from On High*.**",
