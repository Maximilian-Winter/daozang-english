  "full_translation": "The *Discourse on the Mysterious Outer Layer* (自序):\n\nThe *Discourse on the Mysterious Outer Layer* is what Master Lü (陸生) has expounded. Having heard the **Dao** of nature and life (性命之学) from the **Sage-Teacher** (聖師), Master Lü suddenly found resonance within its core (有契於其衷), and thus recorded the teachings he received, composing a treatise in twenty chapters, totaling over seven thousand words, which he titled *Mysterious Outer Layer* (《玄肤》).\n\nThe term \"Mysterious Outer Layer\" (玄肤) refers to the superficial grasp of profound **Dao**—not its true mastery (非精诣也). The further one drifts from the Sage, the more the **Great Way** (大道) is lost; blind and deluded guides (狂瞽之師) each peddle their own limited perspectives (各售所見). Some merely borrow superficial resemblances to adorn their deceitful words (窃近似以文神奸), thus giving rise to the **mouth-Dao** monks (口禅之衲), who scramble for clever rhetorical points (兢斗機鋒), or to those who monopolize discussions (垄断之夫), recklessly debating **elixirs** (黃白) and **inner alchemy** (闺丹). In terms of **Dao** practice, they mislead with reckless theories (首亂); in terms of **medical alchemy** (服食), they harm life with **minerals and metals** (金石). With **Dao** studies thus obscured (學術不明), calamities spread endlessly (流祸無極). The benevolent must pity this!\n\nAt first, I delved into the **Dao** of the Confucian and Mohist schools (文儒), studying the two **Teachings** (二氏) for nearly twenty years. Yet, I wandered among the dense forests of idle words (错足无虞之林) and stood before the mouths of those who ignore the **Way** (置身不理之口), often stumbling yet always rising again (屡踬屡奋). Only because my initial sincerity (初诚) never waned did I meet this **Dao** (获兹遭遇也).\n\nThe **Dao** of nature (性) must be self-realized (自悟), while the **Dao** of fate (命) is attained through a teacher’s transmission (假師傳). These two principles still have further discourses awaiting completion (尚有遺論). Why? Those who claim to \"self-nature, self-liberation\" (自性自度), even if they possess sharp faculties (上根利器), still require enlightenment through words (領悟於言下). Without direct transmission of **secret teachings** (密旨), they merely rely on their own understanding (徒師心以自用), like the blind who refuse a staff—how can they ever progress (伥伥何之乎)?\n\nThere are three reasons why the **Way** cannot be heard (道之不得聞者):\n\n1. Those who indulge in worldly tastes (朵二朵颐世味), taking delusion (妄) as their norm, or who are ensnared by **emptiness** (耽空) or **harm** (害有之侮), are said to harbor the **heart of disbelief** (不信之心).\n2. Those who, though slightly knowledgeable (少知), still cling to mundane entanglements (罥挂俗网), failing to attain immediate liberation (不即解脱), merely setting aside the **Way** while clinging to partial practices (姑置而少持), are said to possess the **heart of incomplete understanding** (不了之心).\n3. Those who claim to be **Dao**-worthy (具曰子聖) yet reject true **virtue** (善言), grandly theorizing while destroying themselves (高談雄論，千人自廢), are said to suffer from the **heart of arrogance** (不虚之心).\n\nIf any one of these three afflictions exists, the **Sage-Teacher** will not regard them, nor will **true friends** (良友) draw near. Thus, they follow accumulated habits (因循积习) and never attain the **Way** in their lifetime (没齿无闻), dying only when their breath ceases (毙而后已)—truly lamentable!\n\nI, fearing this fate, am restless day and night (早夜遑遑), not daring to abandon myself. Therefore, I discard delusion (摒去妄心) and deeply immerse myself in the **True Way** (沉潜至道).\n\nIn moments of quiet cultivation (静养之暇), I reflect on the **Sage-Teacher’s** instructions (仰思聖師誨諭之旨) and, though unworthy, dare to record these chapters (聊复述之篇章), lest I offend taboos (冒犯忌諱)—which I cannot refuse.\n\nMy aim is simply to reveal the **True Teaching** (真宗), transmit the authentic **Dao** lineage (正脉), and guide people to recognize their native **Way** (乡道).\n\nSome may say, \"Ancient worthies wrote books only after attaining the **Dao** (道成). Yet you, eager to speak before mastery, are not hasty?\" I have heard that the **Highest Sage** (太上) first establishes **virtue** (德), then **words** (言), and that **words** cannot be suppressed (言之不可已也). I, being of the latter category (其次者), must speak. The **Way** itself transcends **virtue** (進於德), and thus requires no words. But **virtue** (德) still has aspirations (有志焉) that have not yet been fulfilled (而未之逮也).\n\nOn the ninth day of the ninth month, the year *Lóngqìng* (隆慶) of the first cycle, marked by the *Dīngmào* (丁卯) year.\n\n**Discourse on the Three Elements** (三元论):\nThe teacher I heard from said:\n\n**\"Discourse on the Three Elements\" (三元论) continued:**\n\nThe teacher I heard from said:\n\n*\"The Elixir has three elements, all capable of extending life.\"* By \"three elements,\" I mean **Heavenly Element** (天元), **Earthly Element** (地元), and **Human Element** (人元).\n\nThe **Heavenly Element** is called **Divine Elixir** (神丹). Divine Elixir is refined by combining upper water and lower fire within the **Divine Chamber** (神室), where formless essence generates form. After nine cycles of transformation, it becomes **White Snow**. After three years of further refinement, it transforms into a **Divine Talisman**. When ingested, one ascends lightly, drifting. This is the miraculous efficacy of the elixir—a marvel of the **Sage’s** divine power. Its method is fully described in the **Yellow Emperor’s** *Dragon-Tiger* (轩辕之龙虎) and the *Stone Coffin* (旌阳之石函) traditions.\n\nThe **Earthly Element** is called **Spiritual Elixir** (灵丹). Spiritual Elixir transmutes metals and stones into precious treasures. Its ingredients—silver, lead, cinnabar, and mercury—are tangible substances, yet they can only benefit the world without granting immortality. When refined through nine cycles with the most potent alchemical agents, they are cast in the **Divine Chamber** to ascend and connect with the **Heavenly Element**. This is the vessel for cultivating the **Way** and the tools for the aspiring adept. The **Highest Sages** of antiquity, known for their sacred deeds, employed methods that were supremely simple: extracting **preheaven lead** (先天之铅) and subduing **postheaven mercury** (后天之汞), discerning buoyancy and maturity. Yet today’s blind teachers, ignorant of this principle, fail repeatedly, achieving nothing. They do not realize that the **Earthly Element** shares its essence with the **Human Element**. Only those who penetrate **yin-yang** and grasp **creation** can speak of this.\n\nThe **Human Element** is called **Great Elixir** (大丹). It involves forging the **Crucible externally** while refining the **Elixir internally**—taking from the **Kan** (坎) to fill the **Li** (离), stealing and reversing the mechanisms. All ancient **High Immortals** and **Sages** relied upon it. Thus, the study of extending life finds its most immediate and practical foundation in the **Human Element**. Hence, among the three elements of the elixir—those dependent on **Heaven, Earth, and Spirits**, which cannot be guaranteed (天元); those governed by refined methods and dual blessings, effortlessly attained (地元); and those where the cosmos is held in hand, transformations arise from the body, and neither spirits nor **yin-yang** can fathom its workings (人元)—which is the greater?\n\nThe teacher I heard from replied: *\"Heaven encompasses Earth, Earth sustains Humanity—thus the distinction between great and small is clear. These are the grades of the three elements.\"*\n\n**Discourse on Internal and External Elixirs (内外药论):**\nThe study of the **Human Element** involves forging the **Crucible externally** while refining the **Elixir internally**, thus distinguishing between **internal** and **external** elixirs. Yet most discussions of external elixirs today fail to grasp their essence, leading the blind to guide the blind—a lamentable state!\n\nThe **Way** resides within the body; internal refinement is its essence. Why then forge the **Crucible externally**? The **Sage** does so only when necessity demands it. The **Ancient Sage** likened it to warfare, saying: *\"Warfare is an unlucky instrument; the **Sage** uses it only when compelled.\"* Indeed, the three grades of superior elixirs—**Divine Qi** (神), **Qi** (气), and **Essence** (精)—are all that we inherently possess from **preheaven**, in their undifferentiated state. Why seek refinement? Thus, even infants are **Sacred Embryos** (圣胎). But once the **emotional passions** awaken, the undifferentiated body is shattered! Once the **primordial unity** is broken, the elixir of the body constantly changes—daily, monthly—all descending into **postheaven** influences. Since **postheaven** substances are all **yin**, their nature cannot endure without supplementation from their **preheaven** counterparts. The **preheaven** counterpart is **Taiyang dry metal** (太阳乾金). By refining **yin** with **yang**, the form endures.\n\n*The Classic of the Contract* (《契》) states:\n*\"To craft an elixir of immortality,\nSeek kindred substances.\nPatch a broken fence with bamboo,\nCover a hen with its egg.\"*\n\nThis analogy is clear and profound.\n\nYet one must also know that **my qi** and **your qi** are both derived from the **Great Ultimate** (太极). Within them, **yin** and **yang** essences interpenetrate their domains, making solitary cultivation impossible. The *Classic of Changes* says: *\"One **yin**, one **yang**—this is the **Way**.\"* *\"Like sounds resonate; like qi seeks like.\"* The *Classic of the Contract* says: *\"Marriage binds qi; in the first year, vitality sprouts.\"* The principles of **creation** follow this: harmony nurtures humanity; rebellion begets the elixir. Divine and mysterious, this cannot be falsified.\n\nTo refine the elixir internally while forging the **Crucible externally**—is it merely to supplement the body’s deficiencies?\n\n**Discourse on Interpenetrating Yin-Yang (阴阳互藏论):**\n*The Classic of the Contract* says: *\"Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Changes* act within them.\"* The *Changes* refer to **Li** (离) and **Kan** (坎). The poem in *Awakening to This* (《悟其》) states:\n*\"First, take Heaven and Earth as the vessel,\nThen gather the **Black Tortoise** and **White Rabbit** to brew the elixir.\"*\n\nHeaven and Earth are the symbols of **yin** and **yang**; the **Black Tortoise** and **White Rabbit** are the essences of **yin** and **yang**. **Li** represents the sun, embodying **yang** essence, yet its central trigrams conceal **yin**—thus **yin** dwells within **yang**. **Kan** represents the moon, embodying **yin** essence, yet its central trigrams conceal **yang**—thus **yang** dwells within **yin**. The *Classic of the Contract* says: *\"**Kan** as male is the sun; **Li** as female is the moon.\"* This explains it.\n\nThus, **Heaven and Earth** are the pure forms of **yin** and **yang**; **Li** and **Kan** are their interpenetration. In humanity, before the **emotional passions** awaken, there is the pure **yin-yang** symbol of **Heaven and Earth**. Once awakened, **yin** and **yang** intermingle, and their interpenetrating essences manifest. The **Eight** of **Minor Yin** governs men, hence at **twenty-four** (二八), their essence flows freely. The **Seven** of **Minor Yang** governs women, hence at **fourteen** (二七), their **Heavenly Water** (天癸) arrives. Is this not **yang** attaining **yin’s** numbers and **yin** attaining **yang’s**, revealing the principle of mutual interpenetration?\n\nSomeone asked: *\"When a man reaches twenty-four (二八) and his essence flows freely, his body is broken—this must be due to some external influence. But when a woman reaches fourteen (二七) and her Heavenly Water (天癸) arrives, what influence is at work?\"*\n\nThe reply was: *\"Whether there is an external influence or not is not the point—once the qi arrives, the undifferentiated unity of the body is already broken. Moreover, beneath the heavy yin of Earth’s domain, when a single yang suddenly arises in revival, this is the eleventh month’s hexagram. At that moment, what does Heaven and Earth truly behold? And why did the Master sigh over it? Was it not because, though the transformative qi of creation’s mutual resonance had not yet thickened into form, its mechanism had already begun to stir?\n\nIn that moment—when motion is still stillness and stillness is motion—this is the primordial *Zhen Yi* (真乙) qi of the pre-Heaven, the root of creation and the pivot of all transformations. Only then, when the signs of life have become manifest and form has taken shape, does it descend into the dross of post-Heaven. Thus, when I speak of ‘breaking,’ I refer to the moment when the qi’s mechanism first stirs—not when the mutual resonance has fully thickened into form.\n\nMoreover, when a man’s essence first flows freely, it does not necessarily begin with the dross of post-Heaven. Only after the qi arrives does it transform into water, and only then does it further transform into essence. The qi that arrives first is the pre-Heaven; its transformation into water is the water born of *Chou Tian Yi* (叩天一). Once the pre-Heaven’s essence is broken, the functions of post-Heaven unfold; once post-Heaven’s functions unfold, the pre-Heaven’s true essence grows ever more concealed.\n\nThe subtleties of creation’s unfolding reach this point—who would dare say otherwise? Let us inquire of the Master on this.\"* — *Discourse on Pre-Heaven and Post-Heaven* (先天后天论)\n\n「“Why does the post-Heaven’s function unfold only for the pre-Heaven’s true essence to grow ever more concealed?”\nHe replied: *“The pre-Heaven’s true essence is unseen. All that is seen belongs to the post-Heaven. Today’s talk of tears, saliva, the mouth’s moisture, semen, qi, blood, and bodily fluids—these are all tangible, dross-like substances, all products of the post-Heaven that cannot be harnessed. Thus, we speak instead of *jing* (精), *qi* (气), and *shen* (神). But when the post-Heaven’s function unfolds, *jing*, *qi*, and *shen* all manifest and emerge in accordance with that function, and thus fall under the post-Heaven. How so? Once the well has been dug, all discussion of its use pertains to the post-Heaven, while the pre-Heaven’s true essence sinks into obscurity, weak and refined, daily diminishing into decay—until it can no longer sustain the body, and old age, sickness, and death ensue. When the post-Heaven’s function is exhausted, the pre-Heaven’s essence is lost as well. Therefore, if one seeks to perpetuate the body’s strength, what else can be relied upon besides the pre-Heaven?”* — *Discourse on Lead and Mercury* (铅汞论)\n\nOr someone asked: *“What is the essence of pre-Heaven’s *qi* as true lead? How does it function?”*\nHe replied: *“True refers to what is opposed to the mundane. True is formless, while the mundane has appearance. If you must compare its nature, let me speak of its origin. When the *Yin* and *Yang* of *Qian* (乾) and *Kun* (坤) interact, the form of *Li* (离) and *Kan* (坎) emerges. The interaction of *Qian* and *Kun* breaks the primal, undifferentiated state. Thus, the post-Heaven’s co positions relegate *Qian* and *Kun* to the exalted but inert realm of the *Wu Ji* (无极), replacing them with *Li* and *Kan*. For the south and north are the two poles of heaven and earth. The pre-Heaven’s coud positions were originally occupied by *Qian* and *Kun*. Now that they are withdrawn and rendered inert, *Li* and *Kan* take their place, and the post-Heaven’s function unfolds. *Li* is the sun, shining in the south; *Kan* is the moon, illuminating the north. When sun and moon’s light intermingle, all things are born. Though called the post-Heaven’s function, its true source is the pre-Heaven’s essence. Thus, *Kan*’s true *qi* transforms into lead—the water born of *Tian Yi* (天一); *Li*’s true *jing* transforms into mercury—the fire born of *Di Er* (地二). Lead and mercury, water and fire—these are all named and visible substances of the mortal realm. To call them ‘true lead’ and ‘true mercury,’ however, is to deny them any name or form. Hence, we must resort to named and visible substances as approximations, adding the term ‘true’ to signify their essence—merely *Yin* (阴) *jing* and *Yang* (阳) *qi*. The *Yijing* (《易》) states: ‘*Jing* and *qi* are the stuff of things; *jing* and *qi* together give rise to all.’ And this is the pre-Heaven’s function at the moment of birth. Because of their mutual concealment, when a man receives his *jing*, it is the one who harnesses *jing* who thrives; when a woman receives her *qi*, it is the one who harnesses *qi* who flourishes. Those who harness *jing* thrive, thus aligning with the Dao to become human; those who harness *qi* flourish, thus rebelling against the Dao to attain the elixir. Pre-Heaven’s *qi* as true lead has its meaning. With the undisturbed true lead of the pre-Heaven tempering the accumulated true mercury of the post-Heaven, their affinity and attraction are as inseparable as husband and wife, parent and child—this is simply the natural order. Those who fail to grasp why this is so are not the ones who truly comprehend *Yin* and *Yang*, nor do they deeply fathom the mysteries of creation. How could they possibly speak of such things?”*\n\n**\"The Theory of Original Essence, Original Qi, and Original Spirit**\n\n*Original qi is lead, original essence is mercury—then what is original spirit?*\n\nIt is said: *Original spirit is nature, the sovereign of essence and qi. Since it exists in duality yet is unfathomable, and is luminously responsive yet boundless, it is thus named spirit. Therefore, when spirit resides, essence congeals; when essence congeals, qi returns; when qi returns, the elixir forms. All are the functions of the pre-Heaven.*\n\nWhat is meant by *original essence* is not the seminal fluid produced through sexual stimulation. Essence is stored in the *Li* (separation), the true fluid of the heart. What is meant by *original qi* is not the breath inhaled through mouth and nose. Qi is stored in the *Kan* (abyss), the true qi of the void. What is meant by *original spirit* is not the faculty of thought. Spirit permeates the *Wuji* (Non-Ultimate), the pristine essence before one’s parents were born.\n\nMan is the *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate). Essence and qi are the *Taiji*’s *Yin* and *Yang*; spirit is the *Taiji*’s *Wuji*. This is what is called *original essence, original qi, and original spirit.*\n\nTruly, the *Cui Xu*’s verse sings:\n*‘This essence is not the dregs of carnal stimulation,\nBut the saliva of the Jade Emperor.’*\nThe Jade Emperor is the sovereign of the heart.\n*‘Saliva of the mouth’* is the heart’s luminous fluid.\n\n*‘This qi is not the breath of inhalation,\nBut rather the mist of the Great Primordial.’*\nThe Great Primordial mist is the pre-Heaven’s true *Yi* (second) qi.\n\n*‘This spirit is not the faculty of thought—\nIt may be compared to the Original Sovereign.’*\nThe Original Sovereign is the Original Beginning.\nThis is the true *Wuji*, transcending heaven and earth, penetrating the cosmos, majestically supreme and uniquely sovereign, transcendent and uniquely active.”*\n\n**The Doctrine of Spirit’s Lineage**\n\n**\"How does one know the Spirit’s governance over essence and qi?\"**\n*\"By examining the post-Heaven body. When the Spirit is too startled, essence scatters and the body becomes dazed and anxious; when the Spirit is too licentious, qi dissipates and the body withers and shrinks. Thus, when Spirit resides in essence, it is called *spirit-essence*; when Spirit resides in qi, it is called *spirit-qi*. Essence and qi, when ruled by Spirit, are like ministers ennobled by their sovereign. Therefore, those who cultivate the True Way hold nothing more vital than nurturing the Spirit. Spirit is Nature itself—when Nature is steadied, Spirit naturally finds peace; when Spirit is at peace, essence naturally abides; when essence abides, qi naturally flourishes. Why so? When Nature is steadied, the heart’s fire does not flare upward; when fire does not flare, the waters do not dry—thus, the body’s essence also abides. All essence within the five *zàng* and six *fǔ* is water. If the body’s essence abides, then the essence of the kidneys is known. The kidneys are the essence’s storehouse; when essence thrives in the kidneys, it accumulates as water, surging upward like mist, rising in billowing clouds, perfuming the Four Great Elements, and irrigating above and below. If I, with Original Spirit, move through this, then ascent and descent, advance and retreat, are as effortless as turning the palm—this is called the interplay of Water and Fire achieving *Jièjí* (fulfillment), this is called post-Heaven qi attained in a state of intoxication. Yet this is but the post-Heaven perspective of my own body. As for pre-Heaven function, its reception, copulation, and rebirth through Spirit-transformation are the work of Original Unity, not of Spirit itself. Thus, those who cultivate the True Way hold nothing more vital than refining the Spirit. Refining Spirit means refining with *Yùyè*—this is the Dao’s way of achieving both beginning and end.\"*\n\n---\n**The Doctrine of the Golden and Jade Elixirs**\n*\"The alchemical methods speak of ‘Golden Elixir refining the form’ and ‘Jade Elixir refining the self.’ What is their intent?\"*\n*\"The Dao is the simultaneous cultivation of Nature and life, where form and Spirit are both refined to their utmost subtlety. ‘Golden Elixir refining the form’ means perfecting life; ‘Jade Elixir refining the self’ means perfecting Nature. What is the Jade Elixir? Jade symbolizes warmth, smoothness, and unyielding purity; gold signifies firmness, unbreakable strength. To refine Nature is to diminish again and again, to conquer one’s selfishness, and to strive for warmth, smoothness, and purity—thus comparing oneself to jade in virtue. Only when inner refinement is complete can one approach the furnace to gather herbs and perform the work of a moment or half-hour.\n\n---\n\n*\"What is called ‘Nature’? What is called ‘Life’?\"*\n*\"Nature is the single source of all things; Life is what one establishes oneself. Nature without Life cannot manifest; Life without Nature cannot be vital. Nature is the master of Life, while Life is the vehicle of Nature. Yet those who speak of these matters today often split Nature and Life into separate schools, unaware that the two are interdependent—like the interplay of Dao and its vessel, presence and absence, emptiness and substance—where one cannot exist without the other. Thus, Nature is the Spirit; Life is the Essence and the Qi. Nature is the boundless Infinite; Life is the Supreme Ultimate. Can they be separated?\n\nSome say the Buddhist school understands Nature, while the Daoist school understands Life. This is not a unified theory. The Buddha teaches the absence of self, breaking the illusion of attachment; the Daoists speak of preserving the Mother, honoring the nameless origin. But how can one know Life without knowing Nature? If one knows Life, can Nature be abandoned? Therefore, to discuss Nature without falling into emptiness, Life is already within it; to preserve the Mother and return to simplicity, Nature is already within it. This is called ‘understanding Life while rooted in Nature’—it is the state where form and Spirit are both perfected and the Dao is truly realized.\"*\n\n*\"Someone asked: ‘Your theory of Nature and Life is both clear and complete. May I ask: what is Nature in the context of a human being? Is it something that can be seen?’*\n*\"Nature is not visible, yet what makes it visible is Nature itself. To seek what makes it visible while ignoring its invisibility is to push Nature ever further away. Why so? Nature, as a thing, can be perceived without the mind’s interference, but cannot be sought with a deliberate mind. In ancient times, the Sage Laozi spoke of the Great Simplicity as the nameless, and the Yellow Emperor sought the Mysterious Pearl from the Formless Image—these metaphors of the ancients carry profound meaning. Let me speak of what gives rise to human life!\n\nThe Infinite’s true essence, the refined Essences of the Five Agents and the Two Polarities, merge in marvelous harmony and condense. What is called Nature is the Infinite; what is called Life is the refined Essences of the Five Agents and the Two Polarities. When these two merge in harmony, then a human being is born. Before birth, the Infinite is a boundless chaos, a vast undifferentiated expanse—what form, what name? What sound, what thread? What scent, what voice?\"*\n\nOnce the refined Essences of the Five Agents and the Two Polarities have condensed, and the One manifests with vitality, what thought, what deed? What deliberation, what scheming? This is the essence of Nature, yet when emotional awareness arises, the essence is obscured.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Only when form arises does the nature of qi and substance appear. Cultivate it well, and the nature of Heaven and Earth remains.\"* What is called emotional awareness is the nature of qi and substance; what is abandoned is the essence of Nature, the nature of Heaven and Earth. Thus, he said: *\"Return to the Great Simplicity, return to the state of an infant, return to the Infinite.\"* This is the cultivation of the Dao.\n\nTherefore, the essential principle of refining the Dao lies in purifying Nature. When Nature is steadfast and the nature of qi and substance is at peace, yet still insufficient to burden it, then the essence of Nature reveals itself. My teacher’s verse says:\n*\"Not lost is Nature, abiding in itself;\nNature abides, qi returns;\nQi returns, the Elixir forms;\nWithin the vessel, yin and yang align.\"*\nThis is the attainment of the post-natal by the pre-natal and the harmonious application of its power.\n\nThis is called the comprehension of Life in relation to Nature.\n\n**On the Nature of Substance and Nature:**\n*\"Nature is singular—why then the distinction between innate Nature and acquired Nature?\"*\nIt is said: *\"Innate Nature is spoken of from the perspective of the pre-natal. Pure, clear, and radiant, it is the complete and harmonious essence. The Sage does not augment it, the foolish do not diminish it. Acquired Nature arises from the private influences of form and qi, thus beginning the differences of purity and impurity, thickness and thinness.\n\nMoreover, the transformations and combinations of the Five Agents and the Two Polarities give rise to the myriad distinctions of sentient beings. Their inquiry and entanglement are not uniform, originating from the moment of receiving qi in the womb. Why? From my beginningless past until today, all has been governed by emotional desires and the rectification of Life’s essence. Pursuing external influences to stir thoughts, encountering things to generate emotions—this conditioning has endured long. Among these, the received qi varies in purity and mixture, so inclinations and cravings differ in depth. Each borrows from innate Nature to fulfill their selfish pursuits.\n\nIndeed, the nature of substance and nature in humans does not act of its own accord. Their function is to borrow vitality from innate Nature, like servants and wayward sons relying on their master’s authority for command.\n\nThus, it is often likened: Nature is water, and when it enters the muddy depths of qi and substance, it is like water flowing into a marsh. When it is channeled and directed, only the marsh is seen, not the water. The marsh cannot move itself—it is the water that moves it. Only the water is obscured by the marsh’s muddiness. With prolonged clarity, the pure settles above, the turbid below. When channeled and directed, it is nothing but water. This is the work of clarification and purification, the power of proper cultivation.\"*\n\n**On the Divine Chamber:**\n*\"The nature of the Infinite is singular—why then the distinction between innate Nature and acquired Nature?\"*\n\n**\"On the Primordial Nature and Spirit:**\n*'Does the Primordial Nature differ from the Primordial Spirit?'*\nIt is said: *'The Primordial Nature is the Primordial Spirit—there is no difference. Because it is subtly responsive yet unfathomable, wondrously adaptive yet without fixed form, it is called Spirit. It is called Primordial to distinguish it from the post-heaven faculties of thought and deliberation.'*\n\n*'Does Spirit have a dwelling place within the human?'*\nIt is said: *'I have heard from the Purple Clarity Immortal Master that humans possess three valleys—these are the voids of the Primordial Spirit, where the luminous essence resides. Their emptiness is like that of valleys, hence they are also called the Valley Spirits. When Spirit abides, life persists; when Spirit departs, death ensues. By day, it interfaces with the external world; by night, it interfaces with dreams. Spirit cannot rest in its dwelling.\n\nThe *Lingshu Inner Canon* states: *\"Guard the Primordial Spirit of the Celestial Valley, and its authenticity will endure.\"* Within the human body, the upper is called the Celestial Valley—this is the *Níhuán* [泥丸]; the middle is called the Response Valley—this is the *Jiānggōng* [绛宫]; the lower is called the Spirit Valley—this is the *Guānyuán* [关元]. These three valleys are where Spirit resides; they are called the Three Fields.\n\nI have expounded upon them thus: The *Níhuán* is the fundamental palace where Spirit dwells; the *Jiānggōng* is the Hall of Illuminated Governance; the *Guānyuán* is the Secluded Chamber of Cultivation. Thus, when the Primordial Spirit resides in the *Jiānggōng*, the ears hear and the eyes see, the five senses fulfill their functions, and the hundred limbs obey accordingly. When the Primordial Spirit resides in the *Guānyuán*, vision withdraws, hearing recedes, and Spirit and *qi* harmonize as the *yíng* and *pò* [营魄] embrace unity.\n\nMaster Yang said: *\"Hide the heart in the abyss, nurturing its luminous root.\"* The abyss is the profound, unfathomable place—the Spirit Valley. This is where Spirit is stored.'\"**\n\n---\n\n**The River-Carriage Discourse**\nWhen Spirit is already stored, this is called returning to the root.\nReturning to the root is stillness, and stillness is the restoration of life.\nThen one sees Spirit and *qi* guarding each other, embracing unity without separation.\nWhen stillness reaches its peak and movement ensues, this is Spirit itself.\nThen, riding the *qi*’s momentum, it ascends to the *Níhú* (泥丸), and thus the path of the River-Carriage begins to open.\n\nTo grasp the River-Carriage’s essence: it is the **Ren** (任) and **Du** (督) meridians of our body, front and back.\nWhen the *qi* first ascends, it surges gently yet powerfully, steaming between the two kidneys—vast as the tide’s rise, flowing like water breaking its banks, overflowing above the five *Shù* (腧) points. This is the *qi*’s unrestrained course, rushing like water without proper channels.\n\nI urgently guide Spirit to return to the **Tailu** (尾闾), so it follows the Tailu upward, passing through the **Jiāshǐ** (夹脊) and **Shuāngguān** (双关), ascending to the **Fēngfǔ** (风府) and reaching the *Níhú*.\nWhen Spirit and *qi* converge here, their dispersion and fusion become evident without need for words.\nSoon after, it descends as the **Xīnměi** (新美) dew, flowing from the **Chónglóu** (重楼) downward through the **Jiānggōng** (绛宫), entering the **Zǐtíng** (紫庭), and returning to its stored place to rest.\n\nThus, in this cyclical irrigation, with time and refinement, *qi* fills the Three Fields, and the upper and lower harmonize—\nas in the saying: *\"Always let the *qi* surge through joints and pores,\nand naturally the essence will fill the valleys while Spirit is preserved.\"*\n\nAt this stage, the signs of inner cultivation are manifest.\nYet without profound practice and true attainment, how could one know the depth of my words?\n\n**The Discourse on Clarifying Spirit**\n*\"Master, you spoke of the dwelling place of Spirit—now I have heard your instruction.\nMay I ask the essence of storing Spirit?\"*\n\n*\"Storing Spirit means condensing Spirit.\nThe most critical aspect of condensing Spirit is clarifying Spirit;\nand the most critical aspect of clarifying Spirit is dispelling desire.*\nThe *Scripture of Purity* (清净经) states:\n*'Dispel desire, and the heart will naturally be still;\nclarify the heart, and Spirit will naturally be pure.'*\nThe *Book of Changes* (易) says:\n*'The sage uses this to wash the heart,\nretiring and hiding in the profound.'*\nBy 'washing the heart,' it means clarifying Spirit.\n\nMaster Zhou (周子) said:\n*'Without desire, there is stillness.'*\nBy 'without desire,' it means the complete dispelling of desire.\n\nNow, Spirit loves purity, but the heart disturbs it;\nthe heart loves stillness, but desire drags it.\nThe heart has two aspects:\nThe heart that disturbs Spirit is the **wandering heart** (妄心);\nthe heart that craves stillness is the **true heart** (真心).\n\nIf the wandering heart persists, it alarms Spirit—how can Spirit then be pure?\nIf Spirit is alarmed, it clings to all things;\nif it clings to all things, desire and grasping arise;\nif desire and grasping arise, this is **affliction** (烦恼);\naffliction and delusion bring sorrow to body and mind—how can the heart then be still?\n\nThus, the most critical aspect of clarifying Spirit is dispelling desire.\nThose who can dispel it observe inwardly their heart: when the heart lacks its own essence, they know the Three Hearts are unattainable.\nThey observe outwardly their form: when form lacks its own essence, they look beyond to things: when things lack their own essence, they know the Four Aspects are all forgotten.\nWhen these three insights are realized, they see only **emptiness** (空), and thus they become empty.\nEmpty of all emptiness, emptiness itself is nonexistent;\nwhen emptiness is nonexistent, neither is its absence—\ndeeply serene and ever-quiet, **emptiness as dharma** (法空) is attained.\n\nThus, the roots and dust are forever still, the Six Desires do not arise, and the heart is still.\nWhen the heart is still, Spirit is naturally pure—\nlike water without ripples, vast and crystal clear.\n\nMaster Xūjìng (虚靖天师) in *The Great Dao Song* (大道歌) says:\n*'To keep Spirit from leaving the body,\ndo not retain even one thing in the Spiritual Hall.\nIf things linger in the heart, Spirit cannot be pure—\nit will dissipate true essence, weakening sinews and bones.'*\nThe teaching of dispelling desire and clarifying Spirit\nawaits the sage for a hundred generations—\nmy words cannot be altered!\n\n**The Discourse on Nourishing Spirit**\n*\"Now that Spirit is clarified, what more is needed?\"*\n\n*\"Nourish it.\nNourishing Spirit means veiling its luminous radiance so it does not reveal itself.\nThe nature of Spirit is this: the more it is clarified, the purer it becomes;\nthe purer it becomes, the brighter it shines.\nFor stillness can generate wisdom, so its radiance blazes forth,\nilluminating all sides and piercing through—\nnothing can conceal or contain it.\nThe *Zhuangzi* (庄子) says:\n*'The serene and tranquil give rise to the radiance of Heaven.'*\nIf this brightness is not restrained, it will overexpose and harm its original nature.\nThe *Zhuangzi* also says:\n*'The ancients who cultivated the Dao\nnourished tranquility with wisdom.'*\nWhen wisdom arises and is used as such, it is called nourishing tranquility with wisdom.\nThe *Discourse on the Pivot of Sitting and Forgetting* (坐忘枢冀论) states:\n*'Wisdom unused is truly like foolishness;\nyet with increased cultivation of stillness and wisdom, both are boundless and perfect.'*\nThe *Dao De Jing* (道德经) says:\n*'Solid yet simple, like uncarved wood;\npure yet muddy, like undistilled water.'*\nAnd again:\n*'While others are brightly enlightened,\nI alone appear foolish.\nWhile others are keenly perceptive,\nI alone seem dull.'*\nAll these are the essential meanings of nourishing Spirit.\"*\n\n**The Discourse on Condensing Spirit**\n*\"Now that Spirit is nourished, where does the practice of condensing lie?\"*\n\n*\"Condensing Spirit means\ntranscending the use within the use—\nit is the ultimate study of life’s essence.\nThe *Canon of Parallel and Homogeneous* (参同契) says:\n*'Cultivate and refine the Spiritual Hall (鄞鄂),\ncondense Spirit to form the body.'*\nMoreover, leaving the palace to cultivate stillness is the core of **Chan** (禅);\nseeking the mysteries of the Water Treasury is the essence of **Dan** (丹).\nClarifying Spirit is vital, but condensing it is urgent.\nThe *Chuǐxū Yín* (翠虚吟) says:\n*'In days past, I met a teacher who gave oral instructions—\nthe key is to condense Spirit into the *qi*’s orifice.'*\nThe *qi*’s orifice is our Spiritual Hall (鄞鄂).\nIn my earlier work, *The Godly Chamber Discourse* (神室论), this is already clearly expounded.\n\nThe scholar who merely knows how to clarify Spirit\nbut does not understand where to condense it\nwill wander without direction,\nand thus fail to grasp the principle of returning to the root and restoring life.\nThe scholar who knows how to nourish Spirit\nbut does not know the method of condensing it\nwill be lost in confusion,\nand thus unable to discern the marvels of transformation and cultivation.\nTherefore, I recount what I have heard\nand again expound this discourse.\"**\n\nThe condensing of Spirit is the essential principle for entering the Dao, the foremost concern of the alchemical family. What is meant by \"condensing\" is not the rigid stillness of a clod, but rather the union of Spirit within the *qi*’s orifice—guarding it closely without separation.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"Carrying the vital essence and embracing the One,\nCan one not remain undivided?\"*\n\nThe *qi*’s orifice is the origin of our prenatal breath, where we receive the vital *qi* of our parents—our very own **Tàijí** (太极). Its names vary: **Qìhǎi** (气海), **Guānyuán** (关元), **Língǔ** (灵谷), **Xiàtián** (下田), **Tiāngēn** (天根), **Mìngdì** (命蒂), **Guīgēnkuàng** (归根窍), **Fùmìngguān** (复命关)—all referring to the same place.\n\nWhen one was still within the womb, the breath of inhalation and exhalation flowed freely with that of the mother. Upon separation from the mother, the severing of the umbilical cord, one established one’s own **Ānlùdǐng** (安炉鼎), a distinct realm of **Yīn** and **Yáng** (乾坤). Yet even then, every breath naturally returns to its original orifice.\n\nFor indeed, breath is the foundation of our life. Within a single **xī** (息), if breath does not reach, then *qi* ceases and death ensues. Exhalation is the expansion of *qi* (**Yáng**’s release), inhalation is its contraction (**Yīn**’s gathering). One exhalation and one inhalation constitute one **xī**.\n\nThe diagnostic family uses this to observe the *qi*; there is a profound meaning here. The *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The breath of the common people is through the throat,\nThe breath of the True Person is through the heel.\"*\n\n\"Through the heel\" means to deeply enter the orifice. The breath of the common people is not without the heel—rather, their Spirit does not abide, so even if their breath enters and exits through the orifice, they remain unaware, as if it were through the throat. The True Person, however, aligns Spirit with breath, deeply rooting it within the original orifice; it lingers like an ever-present thread, never ceasing for an instant. Thus, they achieve **zhuǎnqì zhìróu** (专气致柔), embrace the One without separation, attain **xūjī jìngdǔ** (虚极静笃), and can observe its return.\n\nWhat is meant by \"aligning\" is not chasing the breath and clinging to it, but rather maintaining a state of **wúwàng wúzhù** (勿忘勿助)—neither forcing nor neglecting.\n\nThus, when Spirit aligns with breath, it condenses; when Spirit condenses, the *qi* also condenses.\nWhen Spirit aligns with breath, it harmonizes; when Spirit harmonizes, the *qi* also harmonizes—this is the mutual reliance of the two.\n\nThe method of condensing Spirit begins with regulating breath. Regulating breath means aligning with it—**naturally**, not chasing it.\n\nRegulating breath itself begins with regulating the mind. Regulating the mind means gathering thoughts and returning to stillness, in movement, standing, sitting, or repose, always dwelling within the **qiàngzi** (腔子). With prolonged practice, this becomes instinctive, and naturally, one is cleansed and softened, in harmony with the breath.\n\nHarmony brings alignment; alignment without chasing.\nOrdinary breath naturally ceases, and True breath naturally stirs.\nWhen the **Tuóshuāng** (橐钥) is struck, the **Jing** (精) is refined into *qi*, rising in vaporous ascent, and perfusing the Three Palaces (**Sāngōng** 三宫).\nThis is called **True Tuóshuāng**, **True Dǐnglú** (鼎炉), **True Huǒhòu** (火候).\n\n「“But if True breath is taken as fire, what then is its explanation?” He said: “There is one. ‘Only guard the alchemical furnace and watch the fire’s *huǒhòu*—settle the mind and let the breath follow its natural course. Cease your laborious stirring of the *Dānzào* (丹灶) and *Héchē* (河车); the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s *qi* will refine themselves in soft, unceasing flow.’ The words of ancient sages are countless.\n\nYet it is not that breath *is* fire. Fire is the **divine fire** (神火), while breath is its **Tuóshuāng** (橐钥). Now, when **spirit** (神) and **qi** (气) mutually sustain each other, the spirit remains in **non-action** (无为), yet the movement of *qi* cannot be utterly still. Thus, with each inhalation and exhalation, they flow upward and downward in coordination with the **meridians** (经脉). Who then perceives this movement? It is the spirit.\n\nWhen *qi* flows harmoniously, the **primordial spirit** (元神) alone awakens—spirit and *qi* merge, and the **constriction and relaxation** (宽急) achieve balance. This is the fire’s power being evenly tempered, and only then does the elixir form and the medicine complete itself. I have likened the **Tuóshuāng** to True breath, and indeed, this analogy holds.\n\nNow, when a smith refines gold, he must first strike it with the **Tuóshuāng**—only then does the fire ignite and the gold begin to melt. If he merely blows with a **vast and unrestrained wind** (浩荡之风), the fire’s energy will scatter, and the gold will never be transformed. Why so? Because the **vast and unrestrained wind** (浩荡之风) comes and goes unpredictably—just as the breath of ordinary people through the throat. The **Tuóshuāng’s wind** (橐钥之风), however, is unceasing and soft—just as the True breath of the **perfected** (真人) through the **heel** (踵).\n\nWhen spirit aligns with breath in mutual integration, it is as if fire has found its **wind** (风); when *qi* receives spirit and transforms itself, it is as if gold melts in the fire. Such analogies reveal the truth clearly! »\n\nSomeone asked: *\"How do the Fire Symbols advance and retreat—do they share the same principle or differ?\"*\n\nI replied: *\"In my earlier ignorance, lacking a master’s guidance, I secretly found the study of fire control obscure. I once examined the Circulation of the Cosmos, measured it against the *guà* qi, and divided the hours by the water clock—only to exhaust myself in vain speculation. Now, however, I have suddenly awakened to great insight. I realize that ten thousand volumes of the *Dan* Canon and six hundred fire records are all rendered obsolete by a single utterance. The saying ‘True Fire requires no measurement, the Great Medicine is innate by the *jīn*’—truly, it does not deceive me!\n\nFor alchemical refining, there are inner and outer methods, hence the fire control varies in complexity. The inner refining may be summed in one phrase: ‘Preserve the *jǐnmián* as if it were brocade.’ As for the outer alchemy, it does not refer to the external substances discussed earlier, but rather to the *Tiān Yuán* and *Dì Yuán*. The ‘Symbols’ mean aligning with the Dao of Heaven. The *Dan* method uses the lunar *Gēng Jiǎ* to mirror the maturity of the medicinal materials; the solar *Zǐ Wǔ* governs the ebb and flow of fire control. What is called ‘morning *tún*, evening *méng*’ merely describes the rhythm of advance and retreat—nothing more. Grasp the intent and forget the form.\n\nThe *Wù Zhēn Piān* states:\n‘Inner medicine merges with outer medicine,\nInner harmony demands outer harmony too.\nThe *dān tóu* blending follows its kind—\nNurturing and warming serve dual purpose.\nWithin lies Heaven’s innate True Fire,\nFlame-red in the furnace, ever burning bright.\nAdjust outer furnace heat with diligent care,\nNo art surpasses the True Seed.’\n\nThe ‘True Seed’ refers to the *Rén Yuán*. This is the definitive judgment on Fire Symbols.\"*\n\n*—Yào Huǒ Lùn*\n\n“Are medicine and fire the same? Or different?”\nIt was said: “Medicine and fire may be distinguished, yet may also be unified. Distinct, they differ; united, they are one. How so? When separated, medicine is the *qi* of the Primordial; fire is the spirit of the Primordial. When united, medicine *is* fire, and fire *is* medicine. To know unity without knowing separation leads to unclear gathering; to know separation without knowing unity leaves no method for nurturing.\n\nWhy? At the stage of gathering, medicine lies without, fire within. Fire refines medicine, so medicine and fire may be distinguished. In the stage of nurturing, medicine enters within, returning to the inner—obtaining medicine to activate fire, so medicine and fire may be unified. In essence, fire is the master; thus, if fire is too urgent, the elixir is harmed; if fire is too cold, the elixir scatters. When speaking only of fire without mentioning medicine, it is a matter of ten months; when speaking only of medicine without mentioning fire, it is but a fleeting moment.\n\nAs the Immortal of Purple Clarity said: ‘Refine medicine with fire to forge the elixir.’ This is to govern *qi* with spirit to attain the Dao—even more precise.”\n\n*—Lù Tiān Lùn*\n\n**On Extraction and Addition:**\nSomeone asked: “May I inquire about the principle of extracting lead and adding mercury?”\nIt was said: “I heard from Master Lì-Yáng: after returning medicine to the cauldron, he nurtured it with Heaven’s innate True Fire, gently and unceasingly. All its transformations of extraction and addition arose naturally—no artificial intervention, not even a hair’s breadth.”\n\nThe Dao/Way is without action, yet spirit and *qi* naturally have their own functions—this is the marvel of creation and transformation.\n\nWhat is meant by *\"like rice cooking into rice porridge\"* has profound significance, not merely an analogy for ease.\n\nWhen lead is introduced to mercury, it is like water poured into rice. Water must not be excessive, nor rice too sparse—just as the two *eights* must correspond harmoniously. With fire’s force evenly balanced, the water gradually dries while the rice gradually grows, and thus the porridge is formed.\n\nWhen water gradually dries, it is called *extracting lead*; when the rice grows full, it is called *adding mercury*. Extraction is not an internal reduction—spirit enters the *qi*, like Heaven’s *qi* moving through Earth, its mechanism hidden yet ever-present. Addition is not an external augmentation—*qi* envelops the spirit externally, like Earth’s *qi* receiving Heaven’s, gradually nourishing and expanding it.\n\nFrom this, the embryo perfects and spirit transforms—there is a body beyond the body. The marvel of creation and transformation reaches such depths.\n\nAll this unfolds naturally and spontaneously, with mysteries beyond human comprehension. If one seeks to deliberate *how* to extract or *how* to add, then it strays into contrivance and departs from true nature.\n\nSo-called *naturalness* also holds profound meaning. The Master told me: *“Follow naturalness, not merely submit to it.”* How profound these words are!\n\n“In his final teachings, someone asked: ‘The *Dan* scriptures speak of terms like *hóngqiān* (red lead), *hēigōng* (black mercury), *qīnglóng* (Green Dragon), *báihǔ* (White Tiger), *báixuě* (White Snow), *huángyá* (Yellow Sprout), *mùgōng* (Wood Father), *jīnmǔ* (Metal Mother), *yīngchī* (Infantile Virgin), and *huángpó* (Yellow Old Woman). These are varied names and characters, and even though I have counted them repeatedly, I cannot exhaust their meaning. Now, you have written all this down without further comment. Do you mean to leave some teachings unsaid?’\n\nI replied: ‘No. Listen carefully, and I will explain it to you. In the past, I was a scholar of the *Chaptered Classics*, studying the *Mystic Pool* (玄圃) with no prior understanding. By chance, through fate and circumstances, I was granted the *True Doctrine* (真宗) and came to know its direct path. All the names and principles mentioned earlier, I have thoroughly read and pondered. But only when one recognizes some while discarding others does it serve as a shield against rigid dogma, and then one may truly grasp the *Dao/Way*’s simplicity—it can be expressed in a single phrase.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* is nothing more than the interplay of *one yin* and *one yang* (一阴一阳). *Yin* manifests as *jing* (精), *yang* as *qi* (氣), while *shén* (神) governs both. Thus, *shén*, *qi*, and *jing* are the three essentials of the *Upper Alchemy* (上药). All the terms—*Dragon and Tiger*, *lead and mercury*—are established based on these.\n\nThe ancient immortals spoke in veiled metaphors, not wishing to reveal their secrets lightly. Hence, their words are dense and intricate, their teachings manifold and obscure, so that earnest students might discern the meaning through the text, extracting profundity from superficiality. When the *Heavenly Purity* (天真) accumulates its power over time, a sudden clarity pierces through—then the *nets of words* (言筌) are discarded, and the *root principle* (根本) is seen directly.’\n\nSomeone else asked: ‘The *Mystic Skin* (玄肤) scripture often speaks of *external alchemy* (外药). Yet it omits mention of *gathering, refining, and copulation* (采取交媾). How should students proceed?’\n\nI replied: ‘*Gathering, refining, and copulation* is the *Supreme Venerable’s* (太上) most guarded secret, the vital essence transmitted by the *Thousand Saints* (千圣). I am not unwilling to point it out, but my teacher’s instructions were strict, so I tremble in fear as I write. Still, in my earlier discourse, I seem to have already revealed the key—though it is buried in subtle phrasing and unnoticed.\n\nThe *Classic of Harmony* (《契》) states: *“A thousand cycles of reflection, resplendent and refined—then ten thousand repetitions may reveal its form.”* If earnest students persist through a thousand cycles and ten thousand repetitions, they will refine their essence and perceive the profound meaning.\n\nYet without the frustration of *seeking what has not yet been obtained* (有求而未得之愤), who would truly understand the difficulty of attaining this *Dao/Way*? Without the harmony of *mutual affinity that unlocks understanding* (有相悦以解之妙), who would know my words carry flavor? Alas, alas—now I fear my tongue may falter.’” *The Section on Verifying the Golden Elixir* (金丹就正篇)\n\n「**Preface** I have perused ten thousand volumes of the *Dan Jing* (丹經), and its teachings on eternal life and the Great Medicine (大藥) insist that one must first obtain the *qi* of the primordial *Yin-Yang* (先天真乙之氣) to achieve them.\n\nWhen asked whence this *qi* originates, the answer always points to *that place* (彼處). Yet why should we seek it in others when it lies within our own bodies? Only a few believe this, while thousands doubt it.\n\nFrom my youth, I have cherished this *Dao/Way*, yet my coarse roots and dull nature have prevented me from penetrating its essence. I once took up *The Paramartha Scripture* (《參同》) and *The Awakening to True Reality* (《悟真》), but their dense and convoluted passages left me unable to advance.\n\nThen I met Master Yu Yan (俞琰), who annotated for me the *Dao/Way* of purity and non-action (清净無為之道). He dismissed all external cultivation (身外之修) as mere detours (旁門), and deemed alchemical furnaces and talismans (金鼎火符) as nothing but ordinary fire (炉火). His convictions were unshakable, firmly held from the start.\n\nAlas! If purity alone were sufficient, why would common folk laugh so readily, and why would slander arise so easily? Reading thus, I could no longer remain in doubt.\n\nIn the year *Dingwei* (丁未) of the *Jiajing* era (嘉靖), by chance and fate (因緣遭際), I met the *Dharma Master* (法祖) Lü Gong (吕公) in his thatched hall at the Northern Sea (北海之草堂). Our parting was tender and sincere (弥留款洽), and he bestowed upon me the *Mystic Nectar* (玄醴), consoling me with gentle words (甘言). Such an encounter across three lifetimes (三生之遇) is rare indeed—once in a millennium (干載希觌).\n\nHe first urged me to advance upon the *Highest Vehicle* (上乘之道), saying that *Yin-Yang* union (阴阳合) is the foundation of the *Dao/Way*. At the time, I foolishly raised the teachings of *Sanfeng* (三峰), seeking his approval. The master rebuked me.\n\nLater, he instructed me in the *Song of Gestation* (結胎之歌) and the *Principles of Inner Chamber Practice* (入室之旨), imparting profound and esoteric doctrines (微言奧論) that filled entire scrolls. I recorded them and kept them hidden.\n\nYet I failed to grasp their full meaning. For twenty years, I lingered in hesitation (因循), nearly betraying my master’s kindness.\n\nIn the year *Jiazi* (甲子) of the *Jiaping* era (嘉平), I retreated into the wilderness (遁於荒野), gazing into my mirror and mourning my fleeting years (览镜悲生). My hair had turned half-gray (二毛侵鬓), and I lamented the futility of my efforts (慨勋业之无成), knowing time would not wait.\n\nThen my master appeared in my dreams (恩师示梦), bidding me abandon those teachings and embrace these. I awoke with a profound realization (大感悟), recalling the words he had entrusted to me—now I understood nine out of ten.\n\nCombining these with the *Classic of Harmony* (契論經歌) and repeatedly pondering them, in my slumber (寐寐之間), my spirit cleared, and suddenly, as if illuminated, I composed this treatise.\n\nConfucius said: *“Reverently study the old and you will discern the new.”* What I now know is new, though what I revisited was old. Though these are but my hasty conjectures (臆度之言), I dare not present them to those who truly grasp the *Dao/Way* (有道). Yet perhaps they will not stray far from my master’s intent!\n\nThis was written on the *wan-xian* day (下弦日) of the *Jiazi* year (甲子), in the *Jiaping* month (嘉平月), by *Qian Xu Zi* (潜虚子).\n\n**Postscript** The *Dao/Way* of the Golden Elixir (金丹之道) begins with refining oneself (炼己為先).」\n\nRefining oneself first leads to a settled spirit, a settled spirit to harmonized *qi*, harmonized *qi* to condensed essence—then the people are at peace, the nation prosperous, and victory in a single battle will bring the world to order.\n\nMy teacher once instructed me: *“If a person can practice pure cultivation for a hundred days, they may all become embryo immortals.”* A hundred days of emotional refinement, a single meal to attain the elixir. Ten months of fire practice, shedding the mortal form to achieve divine transformation, altering one’s shape to become immortal—how simple is this!\n\nYet the world finds few who can achieve it. Why is this?\n\nThose with shallow roots hear the *Dao/Way* but do not believe it, those with sparse learning attain it but do not grasp it truly. Blind teachers mislead, pointing east while claiming west, unable to distinguish between Yue and Yan. How then can they separate the *Cang* and *Su*?\n\nOccasionally, when questioned about the *Cangtong* and *Wuzhen*, they fail to clarify methodically, instead declaring that common teachings are easily obtained, oral precepts rarely encountered, and that there are secrets to unlocking gates and expanding apertures, or to transcending form and merging with *qi*. Persistent students, upon hearing these words, hope for swift attainment and reckless fortune, burn incense and swear to the heavens, offer gold and earnestly beg—one phrase enters their ears, and they store it deep in their hearts, yet the *Cangtong* and *Wuzhen* are shelved away!\n\nIndeed, the *Dao/Way* of mutual resonance between yin and yang—following it leads to humanity, opposing it to immortality—are all natural and inevitable, not contrived. Have they not heard the verse in the *Wuzhen*: *“Cease from clever artifice, for it is but heart’s exertion”*? Or the *Cangtong*’s words: *“What the natural order does, is no false or deceitful *Dao/Way*.”* The ancient immortals spoke plainly to guide people—why did they ever conceal anything?\n\nYet they all spoke in absolute silence about unlocking gates, expanding apertures, transcending form, or merging with *qi*. Now, however, such claims exist—this is proof that even the finest steeds lose value when adorned with unnecessary trappings. The great *Dao/Way*’s trials are caused by such people.\n\nAlas! Fish eyes are mistaken for pearls, swallow stones for treasures. The world favors petty techniques, not discerning the depth of the *Dao/Way*—what can one do?\n\nMy teacher once told me: *“The *Cangtong* and *Wuzhen* are the ladder to entering the *Dao/Way*.”* Yet their profound meanings are distant and difficult to analyze; I immersed myself for twenty years before suddenly realizing their clarity.\n\nI am not one who can intuitively grasp and awaken to the *Dao/Way*—it is only through deep contemplation and study that my teacher’s words became verifiable.\n\nNow that I have glimpsed even a little, I dare not hoard it for myself, so I have written this treatise to seek correction from those who truly understand the *Dao/Way*.\n\nThough this is but a broad outline, the finer details of entering the chamber, the subtle distinctions between internal and external fire, are already within the two books. How dare I add to them!\n\n**Postscript** The *Dao/Way* of the Golden Elixir (金丹之道) begins with refining oneself (炼己為先).\nOnce again, *Qian Xu Shi* (潜虚生) expounds upon the upper section.\n\nSomeone once asked *Qian Xu Zi* (潜虚子), saying:\n\n*\"The *Dan Jing* (丹经) speaks of seeking the primordial *qi* (先天一气) among kindred substances. What does this mean?\"*\n\nHe replied:\n\n*\"I was taught by my master that the *Dao/Way* of the Golden Elixir (金丹之道) must rely on the union of yin and yang to succeed. Yin and yang—these are the male and female, the *li* (☲,离) and *kan* (☵,坎), the lead and mercury. These are the fundamental substances of the Great Elixir (大丹).\n\nNow, the true *qi* of *kan* is called lead (铅), and the true essence of *li* is called mercury (汞). The primordial essence (先天之精) accumulates within me, while the primordial *qi* (先天之气) is drawn from the other.\n\nWhy is this so? The other is *kan*—externally yin, internally yang, symbolized by water and the moon, and in human form, the female. I am *li*—externally yang, internally yin, symbolized by fire and the sun, and in human form, the male. Thus, the *Dao/Way* of male and female yin and yang, when followed, brings forth life, but when reversed, produces the elixir. Their principles are one and the same.\"*\n\nThe questioner said:\n\n*\"The *Yi Jing* (《易》) states that *kan* is the central male and *li* the central female. Why then do you say that I am *li*?\"*\n\nHe replied:\n\n*\"This is the teaching of the Primordial Diagram’s (先天图) positions.\"*\n\nMaster Shao said:\n\n*\"The essences of yin and yang are mutually housed within each other’s domains.\"* Moreover, when the *Taiji* divides into the two *Yi* (two primal forces), the two *Yi* form the four *Xiang* (symbols), and the four *Xiang* give rise to the eight trigrams—then *Li* belongs to *Qian* (☰), while *Kan* belongs to *Kun* (☷). *Li* and *Kan* are the interplay of *Qian* and *Kun* that forms the trigrams; male and female are the interplay of yin and yang that forms substance. Thus, when *Qian* and *Kun* interact, *Qian* cannot but become empty and form *Li*, while *Kun* cannot but become solid and form *Kan*. When male and female interact, yin cannot but contain the yang, and yang cannot but root in the yin. This is the distinction between *Kan* and *Li* as \"them\" and \"me.\"\n\nHe said: *\"Then if *Li*’s core is yin essence and *Kan*’s core is yang *qi*, why must my body lack its own essence and *qi* and instead draw them from the other?\"*\n\nHe replied: *\"Indeed, there is such a truth, but my explanation is incomplete. I was once submerged in the teachings of Master Yuwu Lao, and only now do I understand. Let me speak—listen carefully.\n\nI was taught: *'The five phases of yin and yang, in subtle harmony, congeal.'* And from this, life arises. At its beginning, before *Taipu* was carved, the body was whole and complete as the *Taiji*. Laozi said: *'The depth of virtue is like that of an infant.'* Before knowing the union of male and female, the infant cries all day but its throat never grows hoarse—this is the purity of yin and yang. At that time, the primordial body was undivided and unbroken. Why seek externally? Why labor to fill what is already complete? If one cultivates this, what more can be added to the supreme virtue of *wuwei*?\n\nBut when the passions awaken and yin and yang interact, the primordial *qi* then surges and escapes into *Kun*. Thus, the three unbroken lines of pure *Qian* break and become *Li*. *Li* is the sun—when the sun declines, the sighs of old age begin. Can it endure long? Hence, the elixir method draws from *Kan*. To take from *Kan* is to restore the broken *Qian*, to fill the emptied lines, and to recover the pure yang body. This is the teaching of the divine immortals’ return to the elixir.\"*\n\n「One said: *\"My attainment of Li is but from the moment when the primordial qi surges and escapes into Kun. Before this surge, it was originally Kun—why then is it called Kan?\"*\n\nThe other replied: *\"Excellent question! At the beginning of the undivided state, it was indeed Kun, but at the twenty-seventh day of the cycle, there arose a movement of yang. Within pure Kun, when yang suddenly moves—is this not Kan? Thus, Kan is the yang within yin, the moment when the *Taiji* reaches the extreme of stillness and naturally gives rise to movement, the very origin of the primordial. Heaven One gives birth to water, and the true yin-qi is concealed within Kan. The mother is hidden, the child is in the womb—within water, there is metal. If one wishes to forge the Golden Elixir, the method must draw from Kan. This is the source of the medicinal stream, the raft and ladder to true transcendence.*\n\nMoreover, the yang within yin takes movement as its essence, so at the time of drawing from Kan, one must only observe its stirrings. The yin within yang takes stillness as its essence, so after filling Li, one must cultivate nourishment in stillness. He who knows movement and stillness without losing their timing—is this not the Sage? The Sage observes the Dao of Heaven and follows its course. Therefore, the waxing and waning of the moon mirror the aging of medicinal materials, while the early and late hours of the day govern the ebb and flow of the fire’s potency. When the medicinal fire aligns, the elixir is complete. Once the elixir is complete, the body is refined and transformed into spirit.\"*\n\nAnother then said: *\"All that you speak of is of the later Heaven.\"*」\n\n「But what of the earlier Heaven? Is there anything worth speaking of there?»\nHe replied: *«I have sought this very matter in the *Yijing*. The *Yijing* states: *“‘*The refined *qi* forms matter; the wandering *spirit* brings about change.’*”* The *yang* within *yin*—this is called *qi*; the *yin* within *yang*—this is called *jing*. The two mutually depend, and from this, all things arise. I have observed the *Dao* of natural progression: when *jing* arrives first and *qi* follows after, then *yin* envelops *yang* and forms the female; when *qi* leads first and *jing* follows after, then *yang* envelops *yin* and becomes the male. Thus, the distinction of *Li* as male and *Kan* as female is not merely determined after their forms are complete, but is already preordained at the moment of receiving *qi*.\n\nMoreover, the *Dao* of the Inner Alchemy (*Jindan*) is formed by the union of *yin* and *yang*. Human nature follows its course, but the Dao of the Immortal (*Xian*) is contrary—taking from *Kan* while forging the elixir in *Li*. Why then should there be doubt?»*\n\nIn the middle section, someone asked: *«Our body, composed of the four *great elements* (*sida*), belongs entirely to *yin*. Yet at times it moves—does this not belong to *yang*?»*\nHe replied: *«*Li* is fire and the sun; though movement belongs to *yang*, it is truly rooted in *yin*. Hence it is said, *“fire-yang rooted in *yin*.”* Observe how the *lingguang* (soul’s luminous essence) flickers uncontrollably—our body’s *yang* is likewise. Thus, there is ever the danger of reckless dissipation. The Sage understands this, so he takes the true *yi* (primordial) water from *Kan*, to restrain it. Hence, when passion burns within, and *jing* dissipates outward, it is like fire blazing below while water boils in the cauldron. Taking that primordial *yi* *qi* from *Kan*, to suppress my reckless *jing* that is prone to dissipation, is like drawing from a spring into a jar, and quenching the boiling in the cauldron—nothing fails to be rectified.»\n\n*«Then, the method of taking from *Kan*—is there anything worth speaking of there?»*\nHe replied: *«The divine mechanism is most subtle—how dare I speak rashly without my teacher’s guidance? Let me reveal its beginning, awaiting your enlightenment. In the *Yijing*, thunder (*lei*) is within the earth (*di*), forming the *Hexagram of Repetition* (*Fu*). The earth’s nature is heavy with *yin*, yet suddenly there arises a *yang* movement—this is the root of creation’s transformation and the pivotal juncture of all phenomena. When Confucius contemplated the *Yijing* here, he sighed in awe: *“‘*Repetition reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth!’*” The *Qie* (commentary) also attests to this, so the *Yijing* encompasses the *Heaven’s Heart* (*Tianxin*), and the *Hexagram of Repetition* establishes the primordial origin. It further says: *“‘*Issue commands in harmony with the natural order, and do not miss the timing of the *Hexagram’s* movement.’*” This refers to the same. Thus, knowing that thunder arises within the earth and forms *Fu*, one knows that *yang* is born from *yin*, and that the true *yi* *qi* is hidden therein. Need this not be self-evident!*»*\n\n「Some may further ask: *“The growth of medicine, as described in the *Danjing* (Alchemical Classic), is often likened to the three-day *Gēng* (regeneration) cycle—may I inquire about this?”* I replied: *“Kàn (the hexagram of water) represents the moon, and the moon is *Tàiyīn* (Great Yin). It receives the sun’s light and generates brightness. When the moon emerges on the third day, *Gēng* (regeneration), *yáng* (light) begins to sprout. It is similar to the *Hexagram of Repetition*. On the eighth day, the moon reaches its upper arc, illuminating the two *yáng* (light) positions, filling the eastern quarter with vitality—here, the three *yáng* (lights) open *Tài* (prosperity). In the lower arc, *yáng* (light) wanes; when the moon wanes to its end, *yáng* (light) is exhausted. *Bó* (decline) and *Fu* (repetition) follow one another, ending to begin anew. Thus, it revives on the third day. Their *zàohuà* (creation-transformation) is also like this. Alchemical methods mirror this principle to discern the aging and vitality of medicinal materials. My teacher instructed me, saying: *“At moon’s evening, place medicine in the furnace.”* Again, he said: *“When snow reflects upon ice-filled ponds and the new moon clears the fresh tips of willow catkins, then medicine may be cultivated. Heaven’s mysterious workings are fully revealed here.”* I once pondered his words but could not fully grasp them. Now, it dawns upon me—his teachings are profound and vast, shining like the sun and moon bestowed upon my sight.»\n\n*«How then does one apply aged or fresh medicinal materials?»*\n\n*«How then does one refine the Golden Elixir?»*\nThe Golden Elixir’s creation-transformation arises from the **pre-Heaven** *zhēn-yǐ* (真乙) *qi*—that subtle, formless essence of light and clarity. This **pre-Heaven** *qi*, being the purest of yang, is so refined that its subtlety defies measurement, its marvels beyond comprehension. Hence, one must swiftly gather it at the moment of *gǔi-shēng* (癸生)—when its vitality is at its peak—then preserve it for but the briefest instant.\n\nIf delayed even slightly, it congeals into dross and falls under the sway of **post-Heaven** *qi*, transforming from yang back into yin. The verse in *The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) states: *“Seeing it, one cannot use it”*—this speaks of its aging. Another line reads: *“In a flash, fire-smoke ascends, and the True Person emerges”*—this speaks of its swiftness. Ah! The marvels of creation-transformation—who but the **Sages** (聖人) could ever know them? Who but the **Sages** could ever wield them?\n\n---\n\nIn the next section, someone inquired: *“The marvels of creation-transformation are beyond the grasp of mere mortals; the Sages alone can wield them. But we are not Sages—how then can we apply it? What is the essential key?”*\n\nI replied: *“Did not your teacher say: ‘True Earth subdues True Lead, True Lead restrains True Mercury’? What is ‘True Earth’? It is **one’s own Earthly Foundation** (己土). Those who cultivate the elixir must first refine their **Earthly Foundation** (己土); otherwise, the **Spiritual Mercury** (靈汞) will easily dissipate, their efforts yield no fruit, and they risk only greater suffering. The *Classic* (《經》) says: ‘Build the foundation, refine oneself’—this refers to the same principle.\n\n**The Earthly Foundation** (己) as a substance is the **human will** (意), also called **self-nature** (己性). For though it circulates within the four *xiàng* (象)—the forms of Heaven, Earth, Water, and Fire—it has no fixed abode, and thus is named **Earth** (土). The Golden Elixir’s beginning and end both depend upon this. Therefore, when seeking Lead in the medicinal arts, one must **harmonize with the Foundation** (以己迎之); when drawing fire into the crucible, one must **guide it with the Foundation** (以己送之); in the alchemical processes of steeping and refining, one must **preserve it with the Foundation** (以己守之); and in the stages of **nurturing and transmutation** (温养脱胎), one must **fulfill it with the Foundation** (以己成之).\n\nWhen the heart is upright and the will is sincere, then the body is cultivated, the realm is governed, and the world is at peace. This is the **pivotal essence** (枢要) of elixir refinement. The *Contract of the Mystic* (《契》) says: *“Move the grain, align the axis.”* It also says: *“The Pole Star holds the central axis.”*\n\nThe ancient sages left behind many admonitions, their warnings countless. *\"Now, parents beget us through desire, and thus our innate qi and constitution naturally stir with emotion upon encountering things. If one fails to refine the Self, the six senses remain unsettled—when entering the chamber, the Great Use stands before you, the nature moves and passions flare, the fair maiden flees—how then could one, in the brief moment of a talisman’s invocation, seize the dragon’s pearl from beneath its throat? The *Transmission* says: ‘To probe the tiger’s den, to pluck its whiskers—how few escape its jaws! Dangerous! Dangerous! Only great wisdom can shatter this, only great strength can attain it.’*\n\nThe Master instructed me: *'Enter the mirror of the head, dwell within your heart—if the heart is not empty, the vision will not be true.'*\nAh! The principle of emptiness—is this not the key to refining the Self? The *Sutra of Purity* states:\n*'Look inward at the heart—no heart is found;\nLook outward at the form—no form is found;\nGaze far at things—no things are found.\nWhen these three are awakened, only emptiness is seen.\nWhat is emptied is nothing, and nothingness itself is nothing.'\nThis is the meaning of emptiness.\nThe great liberation, the great repose of refining the Self.\nThus the following words continue: *'Ever-still, ever-responsive.'\nAlas! Ever-stillness is the proof of refining the Self;\nEver-responsiveness is the method of seeking Lead.\nThe Master instructed me: *'On moonlit nights, the furnace’s herbs.'\nI stood speechless, unable to reply.\nHe then answered himself: *'Ashes upon the flower-wind seat.'\"*\n\n「’Ah! Those who linger in the fleeting beauty of the world—each takes the wind, flowers, snow, and moon as the four supreme joys.\nEmotions arise from external stimuli, responses never cease.\nYet the Master dismisses them all as mere *ashes upon the flower-wind seat*—is this not the ultimate transcendence of forgetting the Self and forgetting things?\nThe talisman for gathering herbs, the essence of refining the Self—the Master’s instruction to me is profound indeed.\nI once grasped its intent, and now I fully comprehend it.’\n\nOne who heard this exclaimed with joy and stood up: *“Though I have heard Master’s words, I have never grasped the core of the Great Dao. Let me fill my ears with your teachings—I shall retreat and refine myself.”*\n\n**The Seven Refutations**\n**Refutation of the Non-Dao**\n\nMaster Lu, having learned the principles of *nature and fate* from the Sage, saw many scholars from all directions come to him seeking the Dao.\nHe sat and spoke with them, but if they did not understand, he would argue back and forth with them.\nSome would even dispute his words, saying: *“The Sage Laozi once said: ‘The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise. The virtuous do not debate; those who debate are not virtuous.’\nNow you, Master, engage in endless discussion of the Dao—your tongue never ceases, your words never stop.\nIs this not a waste of speech and a detriment to your *virtue/power*?”\n\nLu replied: *“I am guilty. Allow me to explain.\nIn ancient times, Yang Zhu and Mo Di blocked the Way of *ren* and *yi*—Mencius rejected them with words.\nGongsun Chou asked: ‘Outsiders all say you love debate—why is that?’\nMencius answered: ‘Do I love debate? I have no choice!’\nIn the age of the Great Dao, there were no conflicting words among people, no divergent teachings among scholars.\nThus, the Sage harmonized with the world in silent forgetfulness.\nBut the world could not always align with the Sage’s intent, so the Sage had to express concerns and establish speech.\nAs for *The Secret of the Dark Symbol*, *The Dao and Its Virtue*, *The Concordance of the Three*, and *The Awakening to Reality*—these are all the Sage’s *certified records* of the Dao,\nBy which *ren* enlightens the world and all ages without end.\nYet there are reckless teachers and blind followers who cannot inherit the sacred scriptures or grasp the meaning of texts.\nThey act on impulse, their teachings mislead the world—how greatly do they corrupt the hearts of people and confuse the true Dao?\nIt is like a dim, unlit place where mountain demons and wild foxes drag people into valleys.\nIf any see this, they must shout with all their might to drive them away,\nLest they fall into delusion and die without realizing it—how could one conceal emotions and remain silent?\nIf you accuse me of vanity, of preferring my own views and debating for victory, then my words have long gone unheard by others!’”\n\n**Refutation of False Teachings**\n\nPeople of the world favor petty arts, not discerning the Dao’s depth.\nThus, reckless charlatans and false masters thrive, practicing their shameless techniques.\nFor profound *Daoist principles* are too deep to fathom—\nTheir minds unanchored, they easily believe and are deceived.\nNow, let me briefly illustrate the world’s false arts:\nSome burn the fetus of a pregnant woman to fast,\nSome ingest arsenic and sulfur to ward off cold,\nSome wield *lead* swords to unlock gates,\nSome nurture spirit turtles to prolong life,\nSome shake their shoulders and backs, producing faint sounds,\nSome strike their skulls, creating resonant echoes,\nSome sit rigid as stone,\nSome drum their bellies like thunder,\nSome hang upside down like apes,\nSome sleep curled like dragons,\nSome spin lightly like the wind, holding their breath without pause,\nSome move swiftly like monkeys, their steps beyond pursuit.\nSuch examples are countless—\nAll are mere tricks to dazzle the senses and deceive the heart,\nNothing more than Master Zhuren’s words: *“Cunningly contrived techniques to exploit the times.”*\nBut the false *external elixir* and its furnace are the most deceitful.\nEven silver essence, once absorbed into the body, can transmute gold and stone—\nYet the methods of refining and extracting it are widely known.\nThe unlearned, mistaking these for *transformation*, are misled indeed!\n\nHow grievous the error! Next come those who engage in reckless posturing—\nrobbing in plain sight, calling deer \"horses\" while the master remains unaware,\ntrading sheep for oxen without others noticing.\n\nThen there are those who blindly burn and recklessly refine,\nwasting fire and squandering wealth,\nwhile squandering days and neglecting the hour,\nyet claim to have achieved results.\n\nThey are not the Dao deceiving people—\npeople fail to discern the Dao, that is all.\n\nAlas! Without measuring the Dao’s depth yet claiming to love it,\nwithout knowing a teacher’s authenticity yet claiming to have met one,\nhow then can the mad and the deceitful\npresume to lead, to be revered, to receive homage?\nWhat greater shame could there be?\n\nThus I write this treatise—\nto all my fellow seekers of the Way,\ntake heed, take heed!\nBanish delusion early, seek the true truth early—\nmy lash shall not reach you.\n\n---\n\n**The Treatise on Breaking Free of Delusion**\n\nThe fruits and grains of the world,\nlike food and wine,\nonce their forms are broken and their essences exposed,\nall decay and cannot endure.\n\nThose whose bodies are broken are no different.\n\nThe Sage understands this, and thus seeks what he calls *Xiantian Zhenyi* to restore it.\n\nBut today’s talk of *Xiantian* does no more than\ntake a body already broken,\nlock and seal its gates,\ncompress and harmonize its scattered energies,\nand seek to generate *Zhenyi* anew,\nas if this were the path to eternal life.\n\nYet once the true body is broken,\nthe *jing*, *qi*, and *shen* within us\ndaily transform and drift into *Hou Tian*.\nHow could *Zhenyi*’s *qi* remain intact?\n\nIt is like storing already rotting fruit,\nor sealed wine and vinegar gone sour—\nto hope they will not decay is impossible!\n\nThis truth is clear, easily understood.\nNear at hand in the body, far in the world,\nrarely needing metaphor to explain.\n\nThe Dao of *Huandan* is recorded in the *Danjing*, yet scholars fail to study it thoroughly and savor its depths. Instead, they grasp at single phrases or half-sentences, mouthing them as if they held the true transmission and genuine insight. Thus, they spend their lives in blind adherence, fixating on a single aspect while never attaining enlightenment—how pitiable!\n\nI pity these disciples, and thus have written this treatise.\n\nThe ancient sages said: *\"The form is preserved by the Dao; life is prolonged by technique.\"* Today, those who speak of the Dao are everywhere, but where is the technique?\n\nLet me ask you to ponder this.\n\n**Refuting Erroneous Teachings**\n\nToday’s proponents of similar doctrines offer varied explanations, and I shall address them all. The *Jiuyi* method need not be discussed further—it is clearly heretical.\n\nSome speak of *Xiantian* plum pits, their theories resembling mere echoes. Perhaps some of their claims are plausible, but they all deal with tangible, coarse substances—no different from the red lead of the world, merely renamed. To treat these as the Dao risks grave misdirection.\n\nAs for the theories of *li xing jiao qi* (separating form and exchanging qi), the *xu tian liang qiao* (nose and anal cavities), *kai guan zhu jian* (opening gates and forging swords), *shang jin xia jin* (upper and lower ascension), or the absurd claims of twisting peaches into existence, swallowing dates to drink ambrosia, crushing porcelain to brew iron wine, extracting male-female lustful fluids to mix with *qunao* (mushroom spores), or combining autumn stone with human essence—these varied and perverse methods are all the twisted teachings of deluded masters, leading the blind to further blindness. Year after year, they toil in vain, only to meet with failure, moral ruin, and bodily harm, becoming objects of scorn and ridicule. How tragic!\n\nMoreover, the *Xiantian* qi originates from the void. It is invisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear, and cannot be grasped by probing. If one obsessively seeks it through speculation and manipulation, one only drifts farther from it. The so-called *fupian zhiliang* (subtle shifts in weight) are now nowhere to be found.\n\nAs I have heard, true and false are as distinct as incense and skunkweed—cannot dwell together in the same vessel.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Only the ignorant remain unknown to others.\"* If there were those in the world who truly understood, my Dao would not stand alone.\n\n**Refuting Doubts**\n\nSome may object: *\"There is a saying: ‘A single phrase or half-sentence suffices to penetrate the Mysterious—why bother with thousands of volumes of the *Danjing*?’ This suggests that mere repetition holds no value. Yet the Master urges us to read the *Danjing* extensively, to penetrate yin and yang, and to fathom the workings of creation. Might this not be a waste of time, blinding oneself with superficial knowledge?\"*\n\nI reply: *\"Your words are correct. But how does one distinguish true from false, genuine from counterfeit, without discernment? If you lack the eye of the law, how will you judge?\"*\n\nConsider the analogy of testing gold—one must use a stone. The *Danjing* is the stone by which the master tests truth.\n\nIf one fails to study it deeply and thoroughly, yet relies on mere phrases or half-sentences passed down by teachers to seek the Dao, few will avoid heretical sects or be misled by false doctrines.\n\nIn ancient times, a man wished to travel to the capital. Along the way, he asked for directions, but each passerby gave conflicting answers. Fearing error, he dared not proceed. One day, he found a travel guide in a shop, and with it in hand, he reached his destination without mistake—every resting place, market, and checkpoint was accurately noted. Thus, it became clear how vast the difference was between written records and oral transmission.\n\nThe *Danjing* is the travel guide to the Dao. Today, if one abandons the *Danjing* and seeks only fragments of speech from contemporary masters, is it not like discarding the guide and asking strangers for directions—how could one not go astray?\n\nFurthermore, a single phrase or half-sentence is only a key when given by a true master. If you seek a master, where will you find him?\n\nToday’s seekers of the Dao mostly summon alchemists, stoke furnaces with fire, and hope for transmutation, seeking elixirs to ingest—this is called *external* Dao/Way. Yet they do not realize these pursuits spring from delusion. Once delusion takes root, it attracts false companions. Thus, cunning deceivers slip in, exploiting gaps like swapping horses for oxen or turning thieves in plain sight—none perceive it. Even if one wished to expose them, the number of such deceivers is endless.\n\nI, too, before receiving my master’s true intent, nearly fell into their snares. By Heaven’s grace, I did not suffer ruin, so I write this treatise to warn those who come after.\n\nAs for furnace-fire practices, do not say they are without merit—they are the *verification* of the Golden Elixir. The *Paramartha Agreement* states:\n*\"The matter of furnace-fire is truly grounded.\nIt lies in one’s penetrating grasp of yin and yang,\nand deep understanding of creation’s workings—\nonly then will its wondrous applications reveal themselves.\"*\n\nIndeed, refining *qi* through furnace-fire is akin to refining oneself.\nAligning with the Dao’s singular path,\nharvesting its vital moment,\nnurturing and purifying—all follow the same principle.\nThe essence lies in discerning its buoyancy and depth,\nknowing its maturity and tenderness—\nthen the Dao of the Elixir may be attained.\n\nYet today’s proponents of furnace-fire\ndo not know what lead and mercury truly are,\nwhat their precise measures should be,\nor where genuine earth is found.\nInstead, they use common sand and quicksilver,\nrecklessly mixing them—\nsome with eight minerals, others with countless herbs.\nSome take lead oxide and call it liquid gold,\nsome take sand’s essence and call it yellow sulfur,\nsome strip sand’s husk and call it celestial lapis,\nsome extract celestial *jing* to embrace mercury and sand.\nOthers mine tin or ore, playing with the sun’s rays,\nclaiming theirs are true lead, true mercury, true earth—\nfew in the world know, and myriad variations exist,\nyet none surpass this method.\n\nEach clings to their own secret, hoarding and selling their tricks\nwhile the world remains unaware.\nTo trust them in error brings ruin beyond measure.\n\nMoreover, the Dao of the Golden Elixir is Heaven’s most precious treasure.\nIf one seeks external protection and harmonizes method with resources,\nthat is acceptable.\nBut to sell it to others for profit or gifts—\nwhat justification is there?\nTo believe their deceit without scrutiny,\nto employ their techniques without understanding—\nwhat else but folly?\nTo err once and repeat the mistake—\nwhat else but folly?\nTo neglect cultivating virtue\nwhile chasing unattainable blessings—\nwhat else but folly?\n\nThus, they exhaust their wealth and family,\nleaving wives and children starving in poverty.\nEven if they do not meet with disaster,\nfew ever succeed.\nOf those who do, nine out of ten fall into the fate of the immortal sage’s warnings.\nAlas! How perilous it is!\n\nThe Dao of External Elixir lies in human endeavor, yet its completion rests with Heaven;\nIts understanding lies in wisdom, its solidification in fortune;\nIts secrets lie with the master, its clarity with keen insight—\nnothing may be borrowed or neglected by even a hair’s breadth.\n\nIf one secretly cultivates virtue and binds the heart in sincerity,\nletting virtue move Heaven and Earth, and sincerity awaken spirits,\nthen at the moment of standing before the furnace,\nthere will be no fear of loss or failure.\nOtherwise, though methods may be correct and insight clear,\nhow can one avoid being tested like a demon?\nI have personally tested and verified this—\nnow I dare not conceal it.\nI fear that if others remain unaware,\nthey may act recklessly in ignorance,\nultimately failing and falling into discouragement.\nIt is not the Dao that betrays them—\nthey simply do not know it.\n\nIf one knows it yet does not act,\nacts yet does not apply it,\napplies it yet does not hoard it selfishly—\nthen that would be even better!\n\n**Breaking the Delusion on the Golden Elixir Dao:**\nKnowing it must be true,\npracticing it must be early.\nThus, Pure Yang Master said:\n*\"Even starting swiftly is still too late.\"*\n\nThe world does not understand,\nclinging to the saying that \"the One Hundred and Twenty [years] of the Highest Venerable can all be reclaimed.\"\nIn their prime of strength and wealth,\nthey sink in the river of desire,\nentangled in worldly bonds,\nnot immediately liberating themselves,\nday and night consumed in vain pursuits,\nuntil their vitality is nearly exhausted.\n\nWhen evening comes and the path is blocked,\nthey then turn to the Dao,\ntreating it as a last resort.\nThey do not realize that time does not wait,\nthe celestial cycles are fulfilled,\nthe elixir ingredients are scarce,\nand the foundation for support is gone.\nEven if they encounter a master and obtain the medicine,\nthe moment and conditions have already passed.\nWith a lifetime spent in vain,\nthey only sigh at emptiness—\nhow tragic!\n\nThus, Master Ziyang’s *Awakening to Truth* opens with a metaphor:\nlightning-fire is fleeting,\nthe world is a bubble—\nhis warning is profound and urgent.\n\nSomeone asked about the *Huangting* saying of \"One Hundred and Twenty\":\n*\"In the ancient age, people were pure and customs simple,\nmarriage came late.\"*\n\n「Like a fertile field,\nwhose strength has not yet waned,\nlate planting still yields a harvest.\nBut now the land is barren and exhausted,\nand cultivation comes too late—\nthen the sprouts do not flourish,\nand even if they do, they bear no fruit.\nNo wonder this is so.\n\nMoreover, the people of ancient and modern times differ,\nfor the winds of custom shape them thus.\nHow then can one judge the ancient age\nby the standards of today’s folk?\n\nThe essence of the *Golden Elixir* is illustrated in the *Great Outline of the Dao*:\n\nThe ancient alchemical methods,\nrecorded in the *Dan Jing*,\nnumber in the thousands.\nReading them brings only confusion and difficulty,\nbut understanding reveals their simplicity and ease.\nThe core lies in observing the Dao of Heaven\nand following Heaven’s movements—\nthen both are fully grasped.\n\nThe interplay of *yin* and *yang*,\ntheir harmonious union, is the Dao of Heaven;\nthe revolutions of the sun and moon,\nthe alternating light of day and night, are Heaven’s movements.\nThe *Book of Changes* states:\n*\"Heaven and Earth set their positions,\nand the *Yi* operates within them.\"*\nHere, *Yi* refers to *Li* and *Kan* (☲☵).\nThe Sage understood this truth,\nand thus patterned his alchemical methods accordingly.\nHence, the *Qian* and *Kun* (☰☷) are taken as the crucible,\nand the *wu* and *jie* (乌免) as the medicinal ingredients.\nYet within their transformations—\nthe waxing, waning, filling, and emptying—\nthese are again measured\nto determine the *fire* and *yin* conditions.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The sun and moon have their cycles,\nthe great and small have their fixed numbers,\nand from this, the Sage’s work arises,\nthe divine radiance emerges.\"*\nIn summary, it is said:\n*\"To steal the mechanism and reverse its use\nis to exhaust the Dao.\"*\n\nThis is the Dao’s periphery—\nwords cannot fully convey it,\nand diagrams cannot capture it.\nIf one encounters a master and receives the key,\nthen even the slightest hint aligns perfectly,\nand understanding follows.\n\nThe greatest affliction is that people lack wisdom,\nunable to penetrate and grasp its depth—\nthus their search grows ever more distant.\nSome are misled by plausible falsehoods,\nothers ensnared by preconceived notions—\nthen toxic teachings seep into the heart,\nand stubborn errors become ingrained.\nI have no remedy for this.\n\nFortunate indeed am I,\na humble and empty man,\nto meet a Sage as my teacher,\nwho has guided me for many years.\nThanks to his unobstructed grace,\nI now behold the hallowed chamber,\nand realize that such encounters in this age\nare rare as the stars above.\n\nScholars of the Dao from all directions\nsay I may teach them,\nand they bring their own interpretations\nto cross-examine and verify.\nCompared to what I have heard from my teacher,\nmost are like square pegs in round holes.\n\nIt is not that the Dao varies—\neach household has its own window and door.\nLaozi said:\n*\"The Great Dao is smooth and even,\nyet people prefer narrow paths.\"*\n\nThe Dao of the *Golden Elixir* is supremely simple and easy,\nyet any artificial arrangement or contrivance\nleads to error and unnaturalness.\nThus, my diagrams and explanations\ntrace back to the fundamental source,\npoint directly to the vital art,\nand outline the essential principles—\nthe great meaning is made clear.\n\nThe goal is to never stray from the teacher’s intent,\nto break down false doctrines,\nand to dispel heretical schools.\nIf those who seek the Dao\nponder and gain insight from this,\nperhaps they may fulfill their nature and destiny\nwithout falling into the labyrinth of deception.\n\nIn the year *Gengwu* (庚午), during the auspicious month of *Jiaping* (嘉平),\nI inscribed this work for *Xian Qixu Zi* (潜虚子)\nin the *Xianjing She* (精舍) to the west of *Nansha* (南沙).\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"There is a thing, indistinctly unified,\nthat existed before Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"I know not its name; I forcefully name it Dao.\"* Again it is said:\n*\"The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\"* Again it is said:\n*\"The world has a beginning, which I call the Mother of the World.\"*\n\nIndeed, the primordial *hunyuan* true *yi* qi—\nthe root from which Heaven and Earth are born,\nfrom which humans and all things arise—\nbefore any movement stirs,\nis boundless and formless, its light obscured,\nits sound and essence extinguished—\nthis is called *wuji* (the Non-Extreme).\nIn the human, this is the state of utmost stillness,\nunmoved and unsentient.\nThe Buddhist speaks of *zhēnkōng* (true emptiness),\nthe Confucian of *mòfā* (unmanifested),\nyet all are but Laozi’s words:\n*\"Ever without

power of stillness, does one attain.\"*\n\nThus, eternal cessation of affliction,\nultimate fulfillment achieved—\nwithout rising from seated meditation,\none enters *nirvana*.\n\nThe Three Teachings’ sages share one essence,\nthough their methods differ—\nhence the distinction among them.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n*\"From emptiness, the Dao generates one qi,\nfrom one qi, yin and yang arise.\"*\n\nThe *Extreme* refers to the undifferentiated form\nof yin and yang before their division.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The Dao generates One.\"*\nThis One is the *Taiji*.\nIn the human, it is called the *Xuanpin* (Mysterious Female).\n\nFor the *Xuanpin* is the natural union\nof true essence and refined spirit—\nthe emergence of being from non-being,\nof substance from emptiness—\nthe root of divine qi,\nthe orifice of nature and life.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"Ever with desire, one beholds its limits.\"*\nThe study of limits thus became\nthe eternal foundation for sages’ command over life,\nwhereby divine function arises\nand sacred power manifests.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The Dao generates One; One generates Two.\"*\nThis is the division of the *Taiji* into the Two Principles.\n\nWhen the Two Principles divide,\nHeaven encompasses Earth externally,\nEarth is contained within Heaven,\nand the subtlety of yin within yang,\nyang within yin, is embodied therein.\n\nFor from emptiness arises one qi—\nstillness reaching its peak, motion begins—\nthe yang within yin.\nWhen the Two Principles divide,\nHeaven encompasses Earth externally,\nEarth is contained within Heaven—\nmotion embracing stillness—\nthe yin within yang.\n\nMaster Shao said:\n*\"The essences of yin and yang\nmutually conceal their abodes.\"*\nThus, the alchemical method employs\nyang within yin and yin within yang,\nyet ever prioritizes stillness.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The heavy is the root of the light;\nstillness is the lord of agitation.\"*\nFor to be still is to embrace *bao yuan shou yi*\nand return to *wuji*.\n\nOnce Heaven and Earth are divided,\nthe sun and moon revolve,\ntheir luminous interplay giving rise to transformation.\nThe sun and moon are the refined essences of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang—\nin the trigrams, *Li* and *Kan*.\nThe yin within *Li* is called *wu jing* (crow essence);\nthe yang within *Kan* is called *tu sui* (rabbit marrow).\n\nThe alchemical method uses crow and rabbit as medicines,\nthus employing yang within yin and yin within yang.\nWhat is meant by *\"east enters west neighbor, west returns east dwelling\"*\nis but recognizing the concealed essences,\nstealing their mechanisms, and reversing their use.\n\nAncient immortals, when refining the elixir,\nheld nothing more vital than procuring medicines.\nYet medicines have precise measures,\nand their gathering is bound by seasons and rules.\nThe key lies in:\n*\"When the moon first emerges on *Geng*, lead is born after *Gui*.\"*\nThe child and the south, the *wu* and the north,\nserve as fundamental principles—\nwith secret precepts beyond written text.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n*\"The tiger leaps, the dragon dances—coarse winds and waves;\nat the central position, the Mysterious Pearl is born.\"*\nAgain it says:\n*\"Medicine meets its kindred qi and reveals its form;\nthe Dao lies in *xīyí*, merging with nature.\"*\n\nKnow that this single point—\nnot called lead, not called mercury,\nbut called *dan*—\nis the natural result of the sun and moon’s intersecting light,\nthe harmonized qi of yin and yang.\n\nThus, the character *dan* symbolizes the sun and moon.\nThe *Xinyin Jing* says:\n*\"The elixir within the body\nis neither white nor green.\"*\nFor green dragon and white tiger\nstill belong to the two families—\nonce returned to the body, they

      "translated_text": "The *Discourse on the Mysterious Outer Layer* (自序):\n\nThe *Discourse on the Mysterious Outer Layer* is what Master Lü (陸生) has expounded. Having heard the **Dao** of nature and life (性命之学) from the **Sage-Teacher** (聖師), Master Lü suddenly found resonance within its core (有契於其衷), and thus recorded the teachings he received, composing a treatise in twenty chapters, totaling over seven thousand words, which he titled *Mysterious Outer Layer* (《玄肤》).\n\nThe term \"Mysterious Outer Layer\" (玄肤) refers to the superficial grasp of profound **Dao**—not its true mastery (非精诣也). The further one drifts from the Sage, the more the **Great Way** (大道) is lost; blind and deluded guides (狂瞽之師) each peddle their own limited perspectives (各售所見). Some merely borrow superficial resemblances to adorn their deceitful words (窃近似以文神奸), thus giving rise to the **mouth-Dao** monks (口禅之衲), who scramble for clever rhetorical points (兢斗機鋒), or to those who monopolize discussions (垄断之夫), recklessly debating **elixirs** (黃白) and **inner alchemy** (闺丹). In terms of **Dao** practice, they mislead with reckless theories (首亂); in terms of **medical alchemy** (服食), they harm life with **minerals and metals** (金石). With **Dao** studies thus obscured (學術不明), calamities spread endlessly (流祸無極). The benevolent must pity this!\n\nAt first, I delved into the **Dao** of the Confucian and Mohist schools (文儒), studying the two **Teachings** (二氏) for nearly twenty years. Yet, I wandered among the dense forests of idle words (错足无虞之林) and stood before the mouths of those who ignore the **Way** (置身不理之口), often stumbling yet always rising again (屡踬屡奋). Only because my initial sincerity (初诚) never waned did I meet this **Dao** (获兹遭遇也).\n\nThe **Dao** of nature (性) must be self-realized (自悟), while the **Dao** of fate (命) is attained through a teacher’s transmission (假師傳). These two principles still have further discourses awaiting completion (尚有遺論). Why? Those who claim to \"self-nature, self-liberation\" (自性自度), even if they possess sharp faculties (上根利器), still require enlightenment through words (領悟於言下). Without direct transmission of **secret teachings** (密旨), they merely rely on their own understanding (徒師心以自用), like the blind who refuse a staff—how can they ever progress (伥伥何之乎)?\n\nThere are three reasons why the **Way** cannot be heard (道之不得聞者):\n\n1. Those who indulge in worldly tastes (朵二朵颐世味), taking delusion (妄) as their norm, or who are ensnared by **emptiness** (耽空) or **harm** (害有之侮), are said to harbor the **heart of disbelief** (不信之心).\n2. Those who, though slightly knowledgeable (少知), still cling to mundane entanglements (罥挂俗网), failing to attain immediate liberation (不即解脱), merely setting aside the **Way** while clinging to partial practices (姑置而少持), are said to possess the **heart of incomplete understanding** (不了之心).\n3. Those who claim to be **Dao**-worthy (具曰子聖) yet reject true **virtue** (善言), grandly theorizing while destroying themselves (高談雄論，千人自廢), are said to suffer from the **heart of arrogance** (不虚之心).\n\nIf any one of these three afflictions exists, the **Sage-Teacher** will not regard them, nor will **true friends** (良友) draw near. Thus, they follow accumulated habits (因循积习) and never attain the **Way** in their lifetime (没齿无闻), dying only when their breath ceases (毙而后已)—truly lamentable!\n\nI, fearing this fate, am restless day and night (早夜遑遑), not daring to abandon myself. Therefore, I discard delusion (摒去妄心) and deeply immerse myself in the **True Way** (沉潜至道).\n\nIn moments of quiet cultivation (静养之暇), I reflect on the **Sage-Teacher’s** instructions (仰思聖師誨諭之旨) and, though unworthy, dare to record these chapters (聊复述之篇章), lest I offend taboos (冒犯忌諱)—which I cannot refuse.\n\nMy aim is simply to reveal the **True Teaching** (真宗), transmit the authentic **Dao** lineage (正脉), and guide people to recognize their native **Way** (乡道).\n\nSome may say, \"Ancient worthies wrote books only after attaining the **Dao** (道成). Yet you, eager to speak before mastery, are not hasty?\" I have heard that the **Highest Sage** (太上) first establishes **virtue** (德), then **words** (言), and that **words** cannot be suppressed (言之不可已也). I, being of the latter category (其次者), must speak. The **Way** itself transcends **virtue** (進於德), and thus requires no words. But **virtue** (德) still has aspirations (有志焉) that have not yet been fulfilled (而未之逮也).\n\nOn the ninth day of the ninth month, the year *Lóngqìng* (隆慶) of the first cycle, marked by the *Dīngmào* (丁卯) year.\n\n**Discourse on the Three Elements** (三元论):\nThe teacher I heard from said:",

      "translated_text": "**\"Discourse on the Three Elements\" (三元论) continued:**\n\nThe teacher I heard from said:\n\n*\"The Elixir has three elements, all capable of extending life.\"* By \"three elements,\" I mean **Heavenly Element** (天元), **Earthly Element** (地元), and **Human Element** (人元).\n\nThe **Heavenly Element** is called **Divine Elixir** (神丹). Divine Elixir is refined by combining upper water and lower fire within the **Divine Chamber** (神室), where formless essence generates form. After nine cycles of transformation, it becomes **White Snow**. After three years of further refinement, it transforms into a **Divine Talisman**. When ingested, one ascends lightly, drifting. This is the miraculous efficacy of the elixir—a marvel of the **Sage’s** divine power. Its method is fully described in the **Yellow Emperor’s** *Dragon-Tiger* (轩辕之龙虎) and the *Stone Coffin* (旌阳之石函) traditions.\n\nThe **Earthly Element** is called **Spiritual Elixir** (灵丹). Spiritual Elixir transmutes metals and stones into precious treasures. Its ingredients—silver, lead, cinnabar, and mercury—are tangible substances, yet they can only benefit the world without granting immortality. When refined through nine cycles with the most potent alchemical agents, they are cast in the **Divine Chamber** to ascend and connect with the **Heavenly Element**. This is the vessel for cultivating the **Way** and the tools for the aspiring adept. The **Highest Sages** of antiquity, known for their sacred deeds, employed methods that were supremely simple: extracting **preheaven lead** (先天之铅) and subduing **postheaven mercury** (后天之汞), discerning buoyancy and maturity. Yet today’s blind teachers, ignorant of this principle, fail repeatedly, achieving nothing. They do not realize that the **Earthly Element** shares its essence with the **Human Element**. Only those who penetrate **yin-yang** and grasp **creation** can speak of this.\n\nThe **Human Element** is called **Great Elixir** (大丹). It involves forging the **Crucible externally** while refining the **Elixir internally**—taking from the **Kan** (坎) to fill the **Li** (离), stealing and reversing the mechanisms. All ancient **High Immortals** and **Sages** relied upon it. Thus, the study of extending life finds its most immediate and practical foundation in the **Human Element**. Hence, among the three elements of the elixir—those dependent on **Heaven, Earth, and Spirits**, which cannot be guaranteed (天元); those governed by refined methods and dual blessings, effortlessly attained (地元); and those where the cosmos is held in hand, transformations arise from the body, and neither spirits nor **yin-yang** can fathom its workings (人元)—which is the greater?\n\nThe teacher I heard from replied: *\"Heaven encompasses Earth, Earth sustains Humanity—thus the distinction between great and small is clear. These are the grades of the three elements.\"*\n\n**Discourse on Internal and External Elixirs (内外药论):**\nThe study of the **Human Element** involves forging the **Crucible externally** while refining the **Elixir internally**, thus distinguishing between **internal** and **external** elixirs. Yet most discussions of external elixirs today fail to grasp their essence, leading the blind to guide the blind—a lamentable state!\n\nThe **Way** resides within the body; internal refinement is its essence. Why then forge the **Crucible externally**? The **Sage** does so only when necessity demands it. The **Ancient Sage** likened it to warfare, saying: *\"Warfare is an unlucky instrument; the **Sage** uses it only when compelled.\"* Indeed, the three grades of superior elixirs—**Divine Qi** (神), **Qi** (气), and **Essence** (精)—are all that we inherently possess from **preheaven**, in their undifferentiated state. Why seek refinement? Thus, even infants are **Sacred Embryos** (圣胎). But once the **emotional passions** awaken, the undifferentiated body is shattered! Once the **primordial unity** is broken, the elixir of the body constantly changes—daily, monthly—all descending into **postheaven** influences. Since **postheaven** substances are all **yin**, their nature cannot endure without supplementation from their **preheaven** counterparts. The **preheaven** counterpart is **Taiyang dry metal** (太阳乾金). By refining **yin** with **yang**, the form endures.\n\n*The Classic of the Contract* (《契》) states:\n*\"To craft an elixir of immortality,\nSeek kindred substances.\nPatch a broken fence with bamboo,\nCover a hen with its egg.\"*\n\nThis analogy is clear and profound.\n\nYet one must also know that **my qi** and **your qi** are both derived from the **Great Ultimate** (太极). Within them, **yin** and **yang** essences interpenetrate their domains, making solitary cultivation impossible. The *Classic of Changes* says: *\"One **yin**, one **yang**—this is the **Way**.\"* *\"Like sounds resonate; like qi seeks like.\"* The *Classic of the Contract* says: *\"Marriage binds qi; in the first year, vitality sprouts.\"* The principles of **creation** follow this: harmony nurtures humanity; rebellion begets the elixir. Divine and mysterious, this cannot be falsified.\n\nTo refine the elixir internally while forging the **Crucible externally**—is it merely to supplement the body’s deficiencies?\n\n**Discourse on Interpenetrating Yin-Yang (阴阳互藏论):**\n*The Classic of the Contract* says: *\"Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Changes* act within them.\"* The *Changes* refer to **Li** (离) and **Kan** (坎). The poem in *Awakening to This* (《悟其》) states:\n*\"First, take Heaven and Earth as the vessel,\nThen gather the **Black Tortoise** and **White Rabbit** to brew the elixir.\"*\n\nHeaven and Earth are the symbols of **yin** and **yang**; the **Black Tortoise** and **White Rabbit** are the essences of **yin** and **yang**. **Li** represents the sun, embodying **yang** essence, yet its central trigrams conceal **yin**—thus **yin** dwells within **yang**. **Kan** represents the moon, embodying **yin** essence, yet its central trigrams conceal **yang**—thus **yang** dwells within **yin**. The *Classic of the Contract* says: *\"**Kan** as male is the sun; **Li** as female is the moon.\"* This explains it.\n\nThus, **Heaven and Earth** are the pure forms of **yin** and **yang**; **Li** and **Kan** are their interpenetration. In humanity, before the **emotional passions** awaken, there is the pure **yin-yang** symbol of **Heaven and Earth**. Once awakened, **yin** and **yang** intermingle, and their interpenetrating essences manifest. The **Eight** of **Minor Yin** governs men, hence at **twenty-four** (二八), their essence flows freely. The **Seven** of **Minor Yang** governs women, hence at **fourteen** (二七), their **Heavenly Water** (天癸) arrives. Is this not **yang** attaining **yin’s** numbers and **yin** attaining **yang’s**, revealing the principle of mutual interpenetration?",

But when a woman reaches fourteen (二七) and her Heavenly Water (天癸) arrives, what influence is at work?\"*\n\nThe reply was: *\"Whether there is an external influence or not is not the point—once the qi arrives, the undifferentiated unity of the body is already broken. Moreover, beneath the heavy yin of Earth’s domain, when a single yang suddenly arises in revival, this is the eleventh month’s hexagram. At that moment, what does Heaven and Earth truly behold? And why did the Master sigh over it? Was it not because, though the transformative qi of creation’s mutual resonance had not yet thickened into form, its mechanism had already begun to stir?\n\nIn that moment—when motion is still stillness and stillness is motion—this is the primordial *Zhen Yi* (真乙) qi of the pre-Heaven, the root of creation and the pivot of all transformations. Only then, when the signs of life have become manifest and form has taken shape, does it descend into the dross of post-Heaven. Thus, when I speak of ‘breaking,’ I refer to the moment when the qi’s mechanism first stirs—not when the mutual resonance has fully thickened into form.\n\nMoreover, when a man’s essence first flows freely, it does not necessarily begin with the dross of post-Heaven. Only after the qi arrives does it transform into water, and only then does it further transform into essence. The qi that arrives first is the pre-Heaven; its transformation into water is the water born of *Chou Tian Yi* (叩天一). Once the pre-Heaven’s essence is broken, the functions of post-Heaven unfold; once post-Heaven’s functions unfold, the pre-Heaven’s true essence grows ever more concealed.\n\nThe subtleties of creation’s unfolding reach this point—who would dare say otherwise?

      "translated_text": "「“Why does the post-Heaven’s function unfold only for the pre-Heaven’s true essence to grow ever more concealed?”\nHe replied: *“The pre-Heaven’s true essence is unseen. All that is seen belongs to the post-Heaven. Today’s talk of tears, saliva, the mouth’s moisture, semen, qi, blood, and bodily fluids—these are all tangible, dross-like substances, all products of the post-Heaven that cannot be harnessed. Thus, we speak instead of *jing* (精), *qi* (气), and *shen* (神). But when the post-Heaven’s function unfolds, *jing*, *qi*, and *shen* all manifest and emerge in accordance with that function, and thus fall under the post-Heaven. How so? Once the well has been dug, all discussion of its use pertains to the post-Heaven, while the pre-Heaven’s true essence sinks into obscurity, weak and refined, daily diminishing into decay—until it can no longer sustain the body, and old age, sickness, and death ensue. When the post-Heaven’s function is exhausted, the pre-Heaven’s essence is lost as well. Therefore, if one seeks to perpetuate the body’s strength, what else can be relied upon besides the pre-Heaven?”* — *Discourse on Lead and Mercury* (铅汞论)\n\nOr someone asked: *“What is the essence of pre-Heaven’s *qi* as true lead? How does it function?”*\nHe replied: *“True refers to what is opposed to the mundane. True is formless, while the mundane has appearance. If you must compare its nature, let me speak of its origin. When the *Yin* and *Yang* of *Qian* (乾) and *Kun* (坤) interact, the form of *Li* (离) and *Kan* (坎) emerges. The interaction of *Qian* and *Kun* breaks the primal, undifferentiated state. Thus, the post-Heaven’s co positions relegate *Qian* and *Kun* to the exalted but inert realm of the *Wu Ji* (无极), replacing them with *Li* and *Kan*. For the south and north are the two poles of heaven and earth. The pre-Heaven’s coud positions were originally occupied by *Qian* and *Kun*. Now that they are withdrawn and rendered inert, *Li* and *Kan* take their place, and the post-Heaven’s function unfolds. *Li* is the sun, shining in the south; *Kan* is the moon, illuminating the north. When sun and moon’s light intermingle, all things are born. Though called the post-Heaven’s function, its true source is the pre-Heaven’s essence. Thus, *Kan*’s true *qi* transforms into lead—the water born of *Tian Yi* (天一); *Li*’s true *jing* transforms into mercury—the fire born of *Di Er* (地二). Lead and mercury, water and fire—these are all named and visible substances of the mortal realm. To call them ‘true lead’ and ‘true mercury,’ however, is to deny them any name or form. Hence, we must resort to named and visible substances as approximations, adding the term ‘true’ to signify their essence—merely *Yin* (阴) *jing* and *Yang* (阳) *qi*. The *Yijing* (《易》) states: ‘*Jing* and *qi* are the stuff of things; *jing* and *qi* together give rise to all.’ And this is the pre-Heaven’s function at the moment of birth. Because of their mutual concealment, when a man receives his *jing*, it is the one who harnesses *jing* who thrives; when a woman receives her *qi*, it is the one who harnesses *qi* who flourishes. Those who harness *jing* thrive, thus aligning with the Dao to become human; those who harness *qi* flourish, thus rebelling against the Dao to attain the elixir. Pre-Heaven’s *qi* as true lead has its meaning. With the undisturbed true lead of the pre-Heaven tempering the accumulated true mercury of the post-Heaven, their affinity and attraction are as inseparable as husband and wife, parent and child—this is simply the natural order. Those who fail to grasp why this is so are not the ones who truly comprehend *Yin* and *Yang*, nor do they deeply fathom the mysteries of creation. How could they possibly speak of such things?”*",

When the Spirit is too startled, essence scatters and the body becomes dazed and anxious; when the Spirit is too licentious, qi dissipates and the body withers and shrinks. Thus, when Spirit resides in essence, it is called *spirit-essence*; when Spirit resides in qi, it is called *spirit-qi*. Essence and qi, when ruled by Spirit, are like ministers ennobled by their sovereign. Therefore, those who cultivate the True Way hold nothing more vital than nurturing the Spirit. Spirit is Nature itself—when Nature is steadied, Spirit naturally finds peace; when Spirit is at peace, essence naturally abides; when essence abides, qi naturally flourishes. Why so? When Nature is steadied, the heart’s fire does not flare upward; when fire does not flare, the waters do not dry—thus, the body’s essence also abides. All essence within the five *zàng* and six *fǔ* is water. If the body’s essence abides, then the essence of the kidneys is known. The kidneys are the essence’s storehouse; when essence thrives in the kidneys, it accumulates as water, surging upward like mist, rising in billowing clouds, perfuming the Four Great Elements, and irrigating above and below. If I, with Original Spirit, move through this, then ascent and descent, advance and retreat, are as effortless as turning the palm—this is called the interplay of Water and Fire achieving *Jièjí* (fulfillment), this is called post-Heaven qi attained in a state of intoxication.

This is the *qi*’s unrestrained course, rushing like water without proper channels.\n\nI urgently guide Spirit to return to the **Tailu** (尾闾), so it follows the Tailu upward, passing through the **Jiāshǐ** (夹脊) and **Shuāngguān** (双关), ascending to the **Fēngfǔ** (风府) and reaching the *Níhú*.\nWhen Spirit and *qi* converge here, their dispersion and fusion become evident without need for words.\nSoon after, it descends as the **Xīnměi** (新美) dew, flowing from the **Chónglóu** (重楼) downward through the **Jiānggōng** (绛宫), entering the **Zǐtíng** (紫庭), and returning to its stored place to rest.\n\nThus, in this cyclical irrigation, with time and refinement, *qi* fills the Three Fields, and the upper and lower harmonize—\nas in the saying: *\"Always let the *qi* surge through joints and pores,\nand naturally the essence will fill the valleys while Spirit is preserved.\"*\n\nAt this stage, the signs of inner cultivation are manifest.\nYet without profound practice and true attainment, how could one know the depth of my words?\n\n**The Discourse on Clarifying Spirit**\n*\"Master, you spoke of the dwelling place of Spirit—now I have heard your instruction.\nMay I ask the essence of storing Spirit?\"*\n\n*\"Storing Spirit means condensing Spirit.\nThe most critical aspect of condensing Spirit is clarifying Spirit;\nand the most critical aspect of clarifying Spirit is dispelling desire.*\nThe *Scripture of Purity* (清净经) states:\n*'Dispel desire, and the heart will naturally be still;\nclarify the heart, and Spirit will naturally be pure.'*\nThe *Book of Changes* (易) says:\n*'The sage uses this to wash the heart,\nretiring and hiding in the profound.'*\nBy 'washing the heart,' it means clarifying Spirit.\n\nMaster Zhou (周子) said:\n*'Without desire, there is stillness.'*\nBy 'without desire,' it means the complete dispelling of desire.\n\nNow, Spirit loves purity, but the heart disturbs it;\nthe heart loves stillness, but desire drags it.\nThe heart has two aspects:\nThe heart that disturbs Spirit is the **wandering heart** (妄心);\nthe heart that craves stillness is the **true heart** (真心).\n\nIf the wandering heart persists, it alarms Spirit—how can Spirit then be pure?\nIf Spirit is alarmed, it clings to all things;\nif it clings to all things, desire and grasping arise;\nif desire and grasping arise, this is **affliction** (烦恼);\naffliction and delusion bring sorrow to body and mind—how can the heart then be still?\n\nThus, the most critical aspect of clarifying Spirit is dispelling desire.\nThose who can dispel it observe inwardly their heart: when the heart lacks its own essence, they know the Three Hearts are unattainable.\nThey observe outwardly their form: when form lacks its own essence, they look beyond to things: when things lack their own essence, they know the Four Aspects are all forgotten.\nWhen these three insights are realized, they see only **emptiness** (空), and thus they become empty.\nEmpty of all emptiness, emptiness itself is nonexistent;\nwhen emptiness is nonexistent, neither is its absence—\ndeeply serene and ever-quiet, **emptiness as dharma** (法空) is attained.\n\nThus, the roots and dust are forever still, the Six Desires do not arise, and the heart is still.\nWhen the heart is still, Spirit is naturally pure—\nlike water without ripples, vast and crystal clear.\n\nMaster Xūjìng (虚靖天师) in *The Great Dao Song* (大道歌) says:\n*'To keep Spirit from leaving the body,\ndo not retain even one thing in the Spiritual Hall.\nIf things linger in the heart, Spirit cannot be pure—\nit will dissipate true essence, weakening sinews and bones.'*\nThe teaching of dispelling desire and clarifying Spirit\nawaits the sage for a hundred generations—\nmy words cannot be altered!\n\n**The Discourse on Nourishing Spirit**\n*\"Now that Spirit is clarified, what more is needed?\"*\n\n*\"Nourish it.\nNourishing Spirit means veiling its luminous radiance so it does not reveal itself.\nThe nature of Spirit is this: the more it is clarified, the purer it becomes;\nthe purer it becomes, the brighter it shines.\nFor stillness can generate wisdom, so its radiance blazes forth,\nilluminating all sides and piercing through—\nnothing can conceal or contain it.\nThe *Zhuangzi* (庄子) says:\n*'The serene and tranquil give rise to the radiance of Heaven.'*\nIf this brightness is not restrained, it will overexpose and harm its original nature.\nThe *Zhuangzi* also says:\n*'The ancients who cultivated the Dao\nnourished tranquility with wisdom.'*\nWhen wisdom arises and is used as such, it is called nourishing tranquility with wisdom.\nThe *Discourse on the Pivot of Sitting and Forgetting* (坐忘枢冀论) states:\n*'Wisdom unused is truly like foolishness;\nyet with increased cultivation of stillness and wisdom, both are boundless and perfect.'*\nThe *Dao De Jing* (道德经) says:\n*'Solid yet simple, like uncarved wood;\npure yet muddy, like undistilled water.'*\nAnd again:\n*'While others are brightly enlightened,\nI alone appear foolish.\nWhile others are keenly perceptive,\nI alone seem dull.'*\nAll these are the essential meanings of nourishing Spirit.\"*\n\n**The Discourse on Condensing Spirit**\n*\"Now that Spirit is nourished, where does the practice of condensing lie?\"*\n\n*\"Condensing Spirit means\ntranscending the use within the use—\nit is the ultimate study of life’s essence.\nThe *Canon of Parallel and Homogeneous* (参同契) says:\n*'Cultivate and refine the Spiritual Hall (鄞鄂),\ncondense Spirit to form the body.'*\nMoreover, leaving the palace to cultivate stillness is the core of **Chan** (禅);\nseeking the mysteries of the Water Treasury is the essence of **Dan** (丹).\nClarifying Spirit is vital, but condensing it is urgent.\nThe *Chuǐxū Yín* (翠虚吟) says:\n*'In days past, I met a teacher who gave oral instructions—\nthe key is to condense Spirit into the *qi*’s orifice.'*\nThe *qi*’s orifice is our Spiritual Hall (鄞鄂).\nIn my earlier work, *The Godly Chamber Discourse* (神室论), this is already clearly expounded.\n\nThe scholar who merely knows how to clarify Spirit\nbut does not understand where to condense it\nwill wander without direction,\nand thus fail to grasp the principle of returning to the root and restoring life.\nThe scholar who knows how to nourish Spirit\nbut does not know the method of condensing it\nwill be lost in confusion,\nand thus

      "translated_text": "The condensing of Spirit is the essential principle for entering the Dao, the foremost concern of the alchemical family. What is meant by \"condensing\" is not the rigid stillness of a clod, but rather the union of Spirit within the *qi*’s orifice—guarding it closely without separation.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"Carrying the vital essence and embracing the One,\nCan one not remain undivided?\"*\n\nThe *qi*’s orifice is the origin of our prenatal breath, where we receive the vital *qi* of our parents—our very own **Tàijí** (太极). Its names vary: **Qìhǎi** (气海), **Guānyuán** (关元), **Língǔ** (灵谷), **Xiàtián** (下田), **Tiāngēn** (天根), **Mìngdì** (命蒂), **Guīgēnkuàng** (归根窍), **Fùmìngguān** (复命关)—all referring to the same place.\n\nWhen one was still within the womb, the breath of inhalation and exhalation flowed freely with that of the mother. Upon separation from the mother, the severing of the umbilical cord, one established one’s own **Ānlùdǐng** (安炉鼎), a distinct realm of **Yīn** and **Yáng** (乾坤). Yet even then, every breath naturally returns to its original orifice.\n\nFor indeed, breath is the foundation of our life. Within a single **xī** (息), if breath does not reach, then *qi* ceases and death ensues. Exhalation is the expansion of *qi* (**Yáng**’s release), inhalation is its contraction (**Yīn**’s gathering). One exhalation and one inhalation constitute one **xī**.\n\nThe diagnostic family uses this to observe the *qi*; there is a profound meaning here. The *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The breath of the common people is through the throat,\nThe breath of the True Person is through the heel.\"*\n\n\"Through the heel\" means to deeply enter the orifice. The breath of the common people is not without the heel—rather, their Spirit does not abide, so even if their breath enters and exits through the orifice, they remain unaware, as if it were through the throat. The True Person, however, aligns Spirit with breath, deeply rooting it within the original orifice; it lingers like an ever-present thread, never ceasing for an instant. Thus, they achieve **zhuǎnqì zhìróu** (专气致柔), embrace the One without separation, attain **xūjī jìngdǔ** (虚极静笃), and can observe its return.\n\nWhat is meant by \"aligning\" is not chasing the breath and clinging to it, but rather maintaining a state of **wúwàng wúzhù** (勿忘勿助)—neither forcing nor neglecting.\n\nThus, when Spirit aligns with breath, it condenses; when Spirit condenses, the *qi* also condenses.\nWhen Spirit aligns with breath, it harmonizes; when Spirit harmonizes, the *qi* also harmonizes—this is the mutual reliance of the two.\n\nThe method of condensing Spirit begins with regulating breath. Regulating breath means aligning with it—**naturally**, not chasing it.\n\nRegulating breath itself begins with regulating the mind. Regulating the mind means gathering thoughts and returning to stillness, in movement, standing, sitting, or repose, always dwelling within the **qiàngzi** (腔子). With prolonged practice, this becomes instinctive, and naturally, one is cleansed and softened, in harmony with the breath.\n\nHarmony brings alignment; alignment without chasing.\nOrdinary breath naturally ceases, and True breath naturally stirs.\nWhen the **Tuóshuāng** (橐钥) is struck, the **Jing** (精) is refined into *qi*, rising in vaporous ascent, and perfusing the Three Palaces (**Sāngōng** 三宫).\nThis is called **True Tuóshuāng**, **True Dǐnglú** (鼎炉), **True Huǒhòu** (火候).",

Cease your laborious stirring of the *Dānzào* (丹灶) and *Héchē* (河车); the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s *qi* will refine themselves in soft, unceasing flow.’ The words of ancient sages are countless.\n\nYet it is not that breath *is* fire. Fire is the **divine fire** (神火), while breath is its **Tuóshuāng** (橐钥). Now, when **spirit** (神) and **qi** (气) mutually sustain each other, the spirit remains in **non-action** (无为), yet the movement of *qi* cannot be utterly still. Thus, with each inhalation and exhalation, they flow upward and downward in coordination with the **meridians** (经脉). Who then perceives this movement? It is the spirit.\n\nWhen *qi* flows harmoniously, the **primordial spirit** (元神) alone awakens—spirit and *qi* merge, and the **constriction and relaxation** (宽急) achieve balance. This is the fire’s power being evenly tempered, and only then does the elixir form and the medicine complete itself. I have likened the **Tuóshuāng** to True breath, and indeed, this analogy holds.\n\nNow, when a smith refines gold, he must first strike it with the **Tuóshuāng**—only then does the fire ignite and the gold begin to melt. If he merely blows with a **vast and unrestrained wind** (浩荡之风), the fire’s energy will scatter, and the gold will never be transformed. Why so? Because the **vast and unrestrained wind** (浩荡之风) comes and goes unpredictably—just as the breath of ordinary people through the throat. The **Tuóshuāng’s wind** (橐钥之风), however, is unceasing and soft—just as the True breath of the **perfected** (真人) through the **heel** (踵).\n\nWhen spirit aligns with breath in mutual integration, it is as if fire has found its **wind** (风); when *qi* receives spirit and transforms itself, it is as if gold melts in the fire.

      "translated_text": "Someone asked: *\"How do the Fire Symbols advance and retreat—do they share the same principle or differ?\"*\n\nI replied: *\"In my earlier ignorance, lacking a master’s guidance, I secretly found the study of fire control obscure. I once examined the Circulation of the Cosmos, measured it against the *guà* qi, and divided the hours by the water clock—only to exhaust myself in vain speculation. Now, however, I have suddenly awakened to great insight. I realize that ten thousand volumes of the *Dan* Canon and six hundred fire records are all rendered obsolete by a single utterance. The saying ‘True Fire requires no measurement, the Great Medicine is innate by the *jīn*’—truly, it does not deceive me!\n\nFor alchemical refining, there are inner and outer methods, hence the fire control varies in complexity. The inner refining may be summed in one phrase: ‘Preserve the *jǐnmián* as if it were brocade.’ As for the outer alchemy, it does not refer to the external substances discussed earlier, but rather to the *Tiān Yuán* and *Dì Yuán*. The ‘Symbols’ mean aligning with the Dao of Heaven. The *Dan* method uses the lunar *Gēng Jiǎ* to mirror the maturity of the medicinal materials; the solar *Zǐ Wǔ* governs the ebb and flow of fire control. What is called ‘morning *tún*, evening *méng*’ merely describes the rhythm of advance and retreat—nothing more. Grasp the intent and forget the form.\n\nThe *Wù Zhēn Piān* states:\n‘Inner medicine merges with outer medicine,\nInner harmony demands outer harmony too.\nThe *dān tóu* blending follows its kind—\nNurturing and warming serve dual purpose.\nWithin lies Heaven’s innate True Fire,\nFlame-red in the furnace, ever burning bright.\nAdjust outer furnace heat with diligent care,\nNo art surpasses the True Seed.’\n\nThe ‘True Seed’ refers to the *Rén Yuán*.

These are varied names and characters, and even though I have counted them repeatedly, I cannot exhaust their meaning. Now, you have written all this down without further comment. Do you mean to leave some teachings unsaid?’\n\nI replied: ‘No. Listen carefully, and I will explain it to you. In the past, I was a scholar of the *Chaptered Classics*, studying the *Mystic Pool* (玄圃) with no prior understanding. By chance, through fate and circumstances, I was granted the *True Doctrine* (真宗) and came to know its direct path. All the names and principles mentioned earlier, I have thoroughly read and pondered. But only when one recognizes some while discarding others does it serve as a shield against rigid dogma, and then one may truly grasp the *Dao/Way*’s simplicity—it can be expressed in a single phrase.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* is nothing more than the interplay of *one yin* and *one yang* (一阴一阳). *Yin* manifests as *jing* (精), *yang* as *qi* (氣), while *shén* (神) governs both. Thus, *shén*, *qi*, and *jing* are the three essentials of the *Upper Alchemy* (上药). All the terms—*Dragon and Tiger*, *lead and mercury*—are established based on these.\n\nThe ancient immortals spoke in veiled metaphors, not wishing to reveal their secrets lightly. Hence, their words are dense and intricate, their teachings manifold and obscure, so that earnest students might discern the meaning through the text, extracting profundity from superficiality. When the *Heavenly Purity* (天真) accumulates its power over time, a sudden clarity pierces through—then the *nets of words* (言筌) are discarded, and the *root principle* (根本) is seen directly.’\n\nSomeone else asked: ‘The *Mystic Skin* (玄肤) scripture often speaks of *external alchemy* (外药). Yet it omits mention of *gathering, refining, and copulation* (采取交媾). How should students proceed?’\n\nI replied: ‘*Gathering, refining, and copulation* is the *Supreme Venerable’s* (太上) most guarded secret, the vital essence transmitted by the *Thousand Saints* (千圣). I am not unwilling to point it out, but my teacher’s instructions were strict, so I tremble in fear as I write. Still, in my earlier discourse, I seem to have already revealed the key—though it is buried in subtle phrasing and unnoticed.\n\nThe *Classic of Harmony* (《契》) states: *“A thousand cycles of reflection, resplendent and refined—then ten thousand repetitions may reveal its form.”* If earnest students persist through a thousand cycles and ten thousand repetitions, they will refine their essence and perceive the profound meaning.\n\nYet without the frustration of *seeking what has not yet been obtained* (有求而未得之愤), who would truly understand the difficulty of attaining this *Dao/Way*?

Yet why should we seek it in others when it lies within our own bodies? Only a few believe this, while thousands doubt it.\n\nFrom my youth, I have cherished this *Dao/Way*, yet my coarse roots and dull nature have prevented me from penetrating its essence. I once took up *The Paramartha Scripture* (《參同》) and *The Awakening to True Reality* (《悟真》), but their dense and convoluted passages left me unable to advance.\n\nThen I met Master Yu Yan (俞琰), who annotated for me the *Dao/Way* of purity and non-action (清净無為之道). He dismissed all external cultivation (身外之修) as mere detours (旁門), and deemed alchemical furnaces and talismans (金鼎火符) as nothing but ordinary fire (炉火). His convictions were unshakable, firmly held from the start.\n\nAlas! If purity alone were sufficient, why would common folk laugh so readily, and why would slander arise so easily? Reading thus, I could no longer remain in doubt.\n\nIn the year *Dingwei* (丁未) of the *Jiajing* era (嘉靖), by chance and fate (因緣遭際), I met the *Dharma Master* (法祖) Lü Gong (吕公) in his thatched hall at the Northern Sea (北海之草堂). Our parting was tender and sincere (弥留款洽), and he bestowed upon me the *Mystic Nectar* (玄醴), consoling me with gentle words (甘言). Such an encounter across three lifetimes (三生之遇) is rare indeed—once in a millennium (干載希觌).\n\nHe first urged me to advance upon the *Highest Vehicle* (上乘之道), saying that *Yin-Yang* union (阴阳合) is the foundation of the *Dao/Way*. At the time, I foolishly raised the teachings of *Sanfeng* (三峰), seeking his approval. The master rebuked me.\n\nLater, he instructed me in the *Song of Gestation* (結胎之歌) and the *Principles of Inner Chamber Practice* (入室之旨), imparting profound and esoteric doctrines (微言奧論) that filled entire scrolls. I recorded them and kept them hidden.\n\nYet I failed to grasp their full meaning. For twenty years, I lingered in hesitation (因循), nearly betraying my master’s kindness.\n\nIn the year *Jiazi* (甲子) of the *Jiaping* era (嘉平), I retreated into the wilderness (遁於荒野), gazing into my mirror and mourning my fleeting years (览镜悲生). My hair had turned half-gray (二毛侵鬓), and I lamented the futility of my efforts (慨勋业之无成), knowing time would not wait.\n\nThen my master appeared in my dreams (恩师示梦), bidding me abandon those teachings and embrace these. I awoke with a profound realization (大感悟), recalling the words he had entrusted to me—now I understood nine out of ten.\n\nCombining these with the *Classic of Harmony* (契論經歌) and repeatedly pondering them, in my slumber (寐寐之間), my spirit cleared, and suddenly, as if illuminated, I composed this treatise.\n\nConfucius said: *“Reverently study the old and you will discern the new.”* What I now know is new, though what I revisited was old. Though these are but my hasty conjectures (臆度之言), I dare not present them to those who truly grasp the *Dao/Way* (有道). Yet perhaps they will not stray far from my master’s intent!\n\nThis was written on the *wan-xian* day (下弦日) of the *Jiazi* year (甲子), in the *Jiaping* month (嘉平月), by *Qian Xu Zi* (潜虚子).\n\n**Postscript** The *Dao/Way* of the Golden Elixir (金丹之道) begins with refining oneself (炼己為先).」",

Ten months of fire practice, shedding the mortal form to achieve divine transformation, altering one’s shape to become immortal—how simple is this!\n\nYet the world finds few who can achieve it. Why is this?\n\nThose with shallow roots hear the *Dao/Way* but do not believe it, those with sparse learning attain it but do not grasp it truly. Blind teachers mislead, pointing east while claiming west, unable to distinguish between Yue and Yan. How then can they separate the *Cang* and *Su*?\n\nOccasionally, when questioned about the *Cangtong* and *Wuzhen*, they fail to clarify methodically, instead declaring that common teachings are easily obtained, oral precepts rarely encountered, and that there are secrets to unlocking gates and expanding apertures, or to transcending form and merging with *qi*. Persistent students, upon hearing these words, hope for swift attainment and reckless fortune, burn incense and swear to the heavens, offer gold and earnestly beg—one phrase enters their ears, and they store it deep in their hearts, yet the *Cangtong* and *Wuzhen* are shelved away!\n\nIndeed, the *Dao/Way* of mutual resonance between yin and yang—following it leads to humanity, opposing it to immortality—are all natural and inevitable, not contrived. Have they not heard the verse in the *Wuzhen*: *“Cease from clever artifice, for it is but heart’s exertion”*? Or the *Cangtong*’s words: *“What the natural order does, is no false or deceitful *Dao/Way*.”* The ancient immortals spoke plainly to guide people—why did they ever conceal anything?\n\nYet they all spoke in absolute silence about unlocking gates, expanding apertures, transcending form, or merging with *qi*.

      "translated_text": "「But what of the earlier Heaven? Is there anything worth speaking of there?»\nHe replied: *«I have sought this very matter in the *Yijing*. The *Yijing* states: *“‘*The refined *qi* forms matter; the wandering *spirit* brings about change.’*”* The *yang* within *yin*—this is called *qi*; the *yin* within *yang*—this is called *jing*. The two mutually depend, and from this, all things arise. I have observed the *Dao* of natural progression: when *jing* arrives first and *qi* follows after, then *yin* envelops *yang* and forms the female; when *qi* leads first and *jing* follows after, then *yang* envelops *yin* and becomes the male. Thus, the distinction of *Li* as male and *Kan* as female is not merely determined after their forms are complete, but is already preordained at the moment of receiving *qi*.\n\nMoreover, the *Dao* of the Inner Alchemy (*Jindan*) is formed by the union of *yin* and *yang*. Human nature follows its course, but the Dao of the Immortal (*Xian*) is contrary—taking from *Kan* while forging the elixir in *Li*. Why then should there be doubt?»*\n\nIn the middle section, someone asked: *«Our body, composed of the four *great elements* (*sida*), belongs entirely to *yin*. Yet at times it moves—does this not belong to *yang*?»*\nHe replied: *«*Li* is fire and the sun; though movement belongs to *yang*, it is truly rooted in *yin*. Hence it is said, *“fire-yang rooted in *yin*.”* Observe how the *lingguang* (soul’s luminous essence) flickers uncontrollably—our body’s *yang* is likewise. Thus, there is ever the danger of reckless dissipation. The Sage understands this, so he takes the true *yi* (primordial) water from *Kan*, to restrain it. Hence, when passion burns within, and *jing* dissipates outward, it is like fire blazing below while water boils in the cauldron. Taking that primordial *yi* *qi* from *Kan*, to suppress my reckless *jing* that is prone to dissipation, is like drawing from a spring into a jar, and quenching the boiling in the cauldron—nothing fails to be rectified.»\n\n*«Then, the method of taking from *Kan*—is there anything worth speaking of there?»*\nHe replied: *«The divine mechanism is most subtle—how dare I speak rashly without my teacher’s guidance? Let me reveal its beginning, awaiting your enlightenment. In the *Yijing*, thunder (*lei*) is within the earth (*di*), forming the *Hexagram of Repetition* (*Fu*). The earth’s nature is heavy with *yin*, yet suddenly there arises a *yang* movement—this is the root of creation’s transformation and the pivotal juncture of all phenomena. When Confucius contemplated the *Yijing* here, he sighed in awe: *“‘*Repetition reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth!’*” The *Qie* (commentary) also attests to this, so the *Yijing* encompasses the *Heaven’s Heart* (*Tianxin*), and the *Hexagram of Repetition* establishes the primordial origin. It further says: *“‘*Issue commands in harmony with the natural order, and do not miss the timing of the *Hexagram’s* movement.’*” This refers to the same.

      "translated_text": "The Dao of *Huandan* is recorded in the *Danjing*, yet scholars fail to study it thoroughly and savor its depths. Instead, they grasp at single phrases or half-sentences, mouthing them as if they held the true transmission and genuine insight. Thus, they spend their lives in blind adherence, fixating on a single aspect while never attaining enlightenment—how pitiable!\n\nI pity these disciples, and thus have written this treatise.\n\nThe ancient sages said: *\"The form is preserved by the Dao; life is prolonged by technique.\"* Today, those who speak of the Dao are everywhere, but where is the technique?\n\nLet me ask you to ponder this.\n\n**Refuting Erroneous Teachings**\n\nToday’s proponents of similar doctrines offer varied explanations, and I shall address them all. The *Jiuyi* method need not be discussed further—it is clearly heretical.\n\nSome speak of *Xiantian* plum pits, their theories resembling mere echoes. Perhaps some of their claims are plausible, but they all deal with tangible, coarse substances—no different from the red lead of the world, merely renamed. To treat these as the Dao risks grave misdirection.\n\nAs for the theories of *li xing jiao qi* (separating form and exchanging qi), the *xu tian liang qiao* (nose and anal cavities), *kai guan zhu jian* (opening gates and forging swords), *shang jin xia jin* (upper and lower ascension), or the absurd claims of twisting peaches into existence, swallowing dates to drink ambrosia, crushing porcelain to brew iron wine, extracting male-female lustful fluids to mix with *qunao* (mushroom spores), or combining autumn stone with human essence—these varied and perverse methods are all the twisted teachings of deluded masters, leading the blind to further blindness. Year after year, they toil in vain, only to meet with failure, moral ruin, and bodily harm, becoming objects of scorn and ridicule. How tragic!\n\nMoreover, the *Xiantian* qi originates from the void. It is invisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear, and cannot be grasped by probing. If one obsessively seeks it through speculation and manipulation, one only drifts farther from it. The so-called *fupian zhiliang* (subtle shifts in weight) are now nowhere to be found.\n\nAs I have heard, true and false are as distinct as incense and skunkweed—cannot dwell together in the same vessel.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Only the ignorant remain unknown to others.\"* If there were those in the world who truly understood, my Dao would not stand alone.\n\n**Refuting Doubts**\n\nSome may object: *\"There is a saying: ‘A single phrase or half-sentence suffices to penetrate the Mysterious—why bother with thousands of volumes of the *Danjing*?’ This suggests that mere repetition holds no value. Yet the Master urges us to read the *Danjing* extensively, to penetrate yin and yang, and to fathom the workings of creation. Might this not be a waste of time, blinding oneself with superficial knowledge?\"*\n\nI reply: *\"Your words are correct. But how does one distinguish true from false, genuine from counterfeit, without discernment? If you lack the eye of the law, how will you judge?\"*\n\nConsider the analogy of testing gold—one must use a stone. The *Danjing* is the stone by which the master tests truth.\n\nIf one fails to study it deeply and thoroughly, yet relies on mere phrases or half-sentences passed down by teachers to seek the Dao, few will avoid heretical sects or be misled by false doctrines.\n\nIn ancient times, a man wished to travel to the capital. Along the way, he asked for directions, but each passerby gave conflicting answers. Fearing error, he dared not proceed. One day, he found a travel guide in a shop, and with it in hand, he reached his destination without mistake—every resting place, market, and checkpoint was accurately noted. Thus, it became clear how vast the difference was between written records and oral transmission.\n\nThe *Danjing* is the travel guide to the Dao. Today, if one abandons the *Danjing* and seeks only fragments of speech from contemporary masters, is it not like discarding the guide and asking strangers for directions—how could one not go astray?\n\nFurthermore, a single phrase or half-sentence is only a key when given by a true master.

The *Paramartha Agreement* states:\n*\"The matter of furnace-fire is truly grounded.\nIt lies in one’s penetrating grasp of yin and yang,\nand deep understanding of creation’s workings—\nonly then will its wondrous applications reveal themselves.\"*\n\nIndeed, refining *qi* through furnace-fire is akin to refining oneself.\nAligning with the Dao’s singular path,\nharvesting its vital moment,\nnurturing and purifying—all follow the same principle.\nThe essence lies in discerning its buoyancy and depth,\nknowing its maturity and tenderness—\nthen the Dao of the Elixir may be attained.\n\nYet today’s proponents of furnace-fire\ndo not know what lead and mercury truly are,\nwhat their precise measures should be,\nor where genuine earth is found.\nInstead, they use common sand and quicksilver,\nrecklessly mixing them—\nsome with eight minerals, others with countless herbs.\nSome take lead oxide and call it liquid gold,\nsome take sand’s essence and call it yellow sulfur,\nsome strip sand’s husk and call it celestial lapis,\nsome extract celestial *jing* to embrace mercury and sand.\nOthers mine tin or ore, playing with the sun’s rays,\nclaiming theirs are true lead, true mercury, true earth—\nfew in the world know, and myriad variations exist,\nyet none surpass this method.\n\nEach clings to their own secret, hoarding and selling their tricks\nwhile the world remains unaware.\nTo trust them in error brings ruin beyond measure.\n\nMoreover, the Dao of the Golden Elixir is Heaven’s most precious treasure.\nIf one seeks external protection and harmonizes method with resources,\nthat is acceptable.\nBut to sell it to others for profit or gifts—\nwhat justification is there?\nTo believe their deceit without scrutiny,\nto employ their techniques without understanding—\nwhat else but folly?\nTo err once and repeat the mistake—\nwhat else but folly?\nTo neglect cultivating virtue\nwhile chasing unattainable blessings—\nwhat else but folly?\n\nThus, they exhaust their wealth and family,\nleaving wives and children starving in poverty.\nEven if they do not meet with disaster,\nfew ever succeed.\nOf those who do, nine out of ten fall into the fate of the immortal sage’s warnings.\nAlas! How perilous it is!",
