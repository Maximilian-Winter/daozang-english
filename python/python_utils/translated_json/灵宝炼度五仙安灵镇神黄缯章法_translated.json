  "full_translation": "**The Yellow Silk Talisman Rite of the Numinous Treasure for Refining the Five Transcendents, Pacifying Spirits, and Securing the Divine**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Yellow Silk Talisman Rite of the Numinous Treasure for Refining the Five Transcendents, Pacifying Spirits, and Securing the Divine*\n**Author:** Unknown\n**Approximate Date:** Eastern Jin to Southern Dynasties period\n**Originally** the latter half of *The Wondrous Scripture on the Five Refining Transformations to Extinguish the Corpse and Attain Liberation*, later circulated as an independent text.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Section Zheng Yi Bu.\n**Collated with:** Dunhuang manuscript P.2865 (latter portion).\n\n---\n\nThe Cavernous Mystery of the Numinous Treasure, the Perfected Great Master of the Red Thearch, your subject [Name] bows his head and respectfully addresses the Most Supreme, the One Qi, the One Qi of the Most Supreme, the Boundless, the Uncapped, the Formless, the Lightless, the Vast and Limitless, the Perfected Great Dao, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, the Thirty-Two Thearchs, and the Jade Sovereign of the Most High Great Dao.\n\nYour subject, entrusted with the great transformation of the Primordial Beginning, has witnessed the opening of the heavens and the liberation of the dark prisons, the hells of the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the hungry ghosts and deceased souls, all emerging from eternal night into boundless light. The imperial Dao has refined them, returning the dead to humanity; the Three Realms are purified, and the Earthly Bureau is at peace.\n\nWe humbly request that those who have attained liberation be entrusted to the Great Yin, their forms lodged in the Earthly Offices. Yet our merit is slight and our virtue meager, and those who have not yet received the talismanic decrees of the *Scripture of the Lady of Qing* remain under our charge. We beseech that they be comforted, sustained, and protected, their rest undisturbed, so they may be reborn into human form.\n\nAt this moment, the hosts of the Great Saints of the Heavens—the Boundless Most High Great Dao Sovereign, the Five Venerable Thearchs, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Southern Palace of Shangchang, the Marshal of Longevity, the Perfected Lord of Compassion, the Numinous Consorts of the Primal Lords, the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, the Perfected Ones, and the seven thousand two hundred and forty youths—simultaneously snap their fingers, proclaiming universally to all heavens, earths, and waters; the sun, moon, and stellar lodges; the jade pivot and celestial balance; the Five Thearchs and Five Marchmounts; the numinous mountains, earthly bureaus, Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, Twelve River Sources, Cavernous Extremes, and Cavernous Abysses; to all without height or depth, nearness or remoteness, bounds or limits, greatness or smallness, end or extremity; to every spirit and deity—so that all may hear and know.\n\nThe golden registers and jade scriptures are entrusted to the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, with the decree that henceforth, all shall be renewed. We reverently uphold the Great Law, permitting no partiality. Though the great cycles of heaven and earth turn, the canonical text remains luminously clear.\n\nNow, in accordance with the ancient statutes of the Upper Palace of the Lady of Qing, we clarify the sagely Dao for the pure and faithful disciple [Name], male or female, of [Prefecture], [County], [Village], aged [Number] years, born in the bing-wu year, registered under the Red Thearch, receiving qi in the seventh month, endowed with yang from the Cinnabar Heaven. Their prior merits remain unfulfilled, their steps mired in this defiled world, stained by its filth, and thus they are subject to extinction. Their destiny is entrusted to the Great Yin, their form lodged in the Earthly Offices.\n\nToday, within the central heavens, in the village of [Name], we establish a palace and erect a chamber as their dwelling. Yet their merit is slight and their virtue meager, and they cannot return of their own accord. Now, pressed and harried by the Earthly Bureau, they find no peace; their hun-souls scatter, their po-souls disperse, and their corporeal forms have no refuge.\n\nIn solemn accordance with the texts of the *Luminous Perfection Great Rites*, the *Golden Registers*, and the *Jade Scriptures*, we reverently invoke the celestial *Numinous Jade Characters* of the *Female Azure* decrees from the heavens above, and petition the Nine Lands’ spirit-officials of [Name] Heaven to pacify and secure the dwelling of [Given Name]’s corporeal remains and earthly abode. We beseech the Nine Qi Azure Heaven’s *Verdant Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected* to descend, accompanied by the immortals of the Eastern Marchmount, riding upon nine thousand myriad azure dragons, bearing the Nine Qi celestial writ of the *Azure Thearch* and the *Female Azure* decrees. They shall descend to the Eastern Quarter’s Nine Lands and their spirit-officials, unlocking the long-night repository of the Nine Dark Hells, and extricate [Given Name]’s hun-souls, restoring them to their former dwelling. Those who ought to be transformed shall be transformed; those who ought to be delivered shall be delivered; those who ought to live shall live; those who ought to return shall return. For those not yet reborn, their corporeal forms shall be clearly stabilized, their protective wei-qi soothed and nurtured, and they shall not be disturbed.\n\nIn accordance with the *Female Azure* texts, offer ninety feet—or nine feet—of azure-patterned silk to the Nine Qi Celestial Lords as a token of deliverance.\n\nWe further invoke the Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven’s *Vermilion Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected* to descend, accompanied by the immortals of the Southern Marchmount, riding upon three thousand myriad crimson dragons, bearing the Three Qi celestial writ of the *Vermilion Thearch* and the *Female Azure* decrees. They shall descend to the Southern Quarter’s Nine Lands and their spirit-officials, unlocking the long-night repository of the Nine Dark Hells, and extricate [Given Name]’s hun-souls, restoring them to their former dwelling. Those who ought to be transformed shall be transformed; those who ought to be delivered shall be delivered; those who ought to live shall live; those who ought to return shall return. For those not yet reborn, their corporeal forms shall be clearly stabilized, their protective wei-qi soothed and nurtured, and they shall not be disturbed.\n\nIn accordance with the *Female Azure* texts, offer thirty feet—or three feet—of crimson-patterned silk to the Three Qi Celestial Lords as a token of deliverance.\n\nWe further invoke the One Qi Yellow Heaven’s *Yellow Numinous Chief Marshal Niu Zong*, the *Life-Spirit Perfected*, to descend, accompanied by the immortals of the Central Marchmount, riding upon twelve thousand yellow dragons, bearing the One Qi celestial writ of the *Yellow Thearch* and the *Female Azure* decrees. They shall descend to the Central Quarter’s boundless, infinite, measureless, and fathomless Earthly Bureau and all its spirit-officials, unlocking the long-night repository of the Nine Dark Marchmount Hells, and extricate [Given Name]’s hun-souls, restoring them to their former dwelling. Those who ought to be transformed shall be transformed; those who ought to be delivered shall be delivered; those who ought to live shall live; those who ought to return shall return. For those not yet reborn, their corporeal forms shall be clearly stabilized, their protective wei-qi soothed and nurtured, and they shall not be disturbed.\n\nIn accordance with the *Female Azure* texts, offer one hundred twenty feet—or twelve feet—of yellow-patterned silk to the One Qi Celestial Lord as a token of deliverance.\n\nWe further invoke the Seven Qi White Heaven’s *Pale Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected* to descend, accompanied by the immortals of the Western Marchmount, riding upon seven thousand myriad white dragons, bearing the Seven Qi celestial writ of the *White Thearch* and the *Female Azure* decrees. They shall descend to the Western Quarter’s Nine Lands and their spirit-officials, unlocking the long-night repository of the Nine Dark Marchmount Hells, and extricate [Given Name]’s hun-souls, restoring them to their former dwelling. Those who ought to be transformed shall be transformed; those who ought to be delivered shall be delivered; those who ought to live shall live; those who ought to return shall return. For those not yet reborn, their corporeal forms shall be clearly stabilized, their protective wei-qi soothed and nurtured, and they shall not be disturbed.\n\nIn accordance with the *Female Azure* texts, offer seventy feet—or seven feet—of white-patterned silk to the Seven Qi Celestial Lords as a token of deliverance.\n\nWe further invoke the Five Qi Mysterious Heaven’s *Dark Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected* to descend, accompanied by the immortals of the Northern Marchmount, riding upon five thousand myriad black dragons, bearing the Five Qi celestial writ of the *Black Thearch* and the *Female Azure* decrees. They shall descend to the Northern Quarter’s Nine Lands and their spirit-officials, unlocking the long-night repository of the Nine Dark Hells, and extricate [Given Name]’s hun-souls, restoring them to their former dwelling. Those who ought to be transformed shall be transformed; those who ought to be delivered shall be delivered; those who ought to live shall live; those who ought to return shall return. For those not yet reborn, their corporeal forms shall be clearly stabilized, their protective wei-qi soothed and nurtured, and they shall not be disturbed.\n\nIn accordance with the *Female Azure* texts, offer fifty feet—or five feet—of black-patterned silk to the Five Qi Celestial Lords as a token of deliverance.\n\nWe further offer five taels of refined gold—or fifty catties of iron—to the Five Thearchs, to pacify and secure the Five Directions.\n\n[Given Name] now falls within the precedent of deliverance. The Nine Lands’ spirit-officials shall each attend to their respective domains, providing sustenance and protection, ensuring the stability of their form and the guardianship of their spirit, so that their po-souls do not scatter. They shall remain thus until their merit is fulfilled, whereupon they shall return to their former dwelling and be reborn by receiving the ford.\n\nMay the Five Thearchs nourish them with the Great Harmony’s primordial essence, guide their qi to nurture their spirit, and let them drink of the Three Luminaries, their dark currents infused with the vast springs. May the jade mushrooms naturally sustain them, their radiance swiftly refined; may their fragrance overflow and their aroma diffuse early. May their hun-souls wander the Upper Clarity, their clothing and sustenance spontaneously provided, their dwelling harmonized with the luminous shadows, never far removed. Together, they shall receive transformation and rebirth.\n\nToday is a day of great jubilation, as boundless souls are delivered. All who are to be delivered shall be so, none excluded. Reverently upholding the ancient rites, we record merit across the heavens. Those who violate the *Female Azure* decrees shall be stripped of office and punished in form. The covenant remains as of old: the golden dragon swiftly conveys the message.\n\nWith this memorial, we humbly await your decree.\n\nYour servant [Given Name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates himself twice in submission.\n\n[Three lines left blank]\n\nYour servant, [Surname and Given Name], of [Prefecture], [County], [Village].\n\nSupreme, supreme, supreme! One qi, one qi! Supreme, supreme, supreme! Boundless, infinite, colorless, lightless, vast and expansive—the utmost Perfected, the Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the *Original Beginning*, the Thirty-Two Thearchs, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Jade Sovereign beneath the Great Clarity.\n\nIn the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day], hour [Hour], at [Location], one memorial on yellow silk is presented, borne aloft by a golden dragon.\n\nAccording to the *Female Azure* ancient canon, this text is inscribed in vermilion upon yellow silk. The master, at the place where the deceased resides, faces north at the hour of zi, burns the five incense fires, performs the Five Pacifications, and presents the yellow silk memorial. The text is exposed to the open air for one night. At dawn the following day, the texts are buried at the respective directions to pacify the spirits and stabilize the form.\n\nWhen these rites are performed, the *Female Azure* texts declare: the nine generations of ancestral souls shall emerge from the long night, their bodies entering the light. The Three Offices shall render judgment, their names recorded in the Heavenly Hall, and their sustenance provided. After thirty-two years, they shall regain their former forms and be reborn.\n\nThose who have not yet returned shall have their bodily forms and former dwellings guarded by the Five Themes' attendants, with earth deities providing protection, solace, and sustenance, ensuring no disturbance. Within a hundred years, none shall fail to transform and be reborn into the human realm. The registers of the Three Realms record this with perfect clarity. The wise penetrate this ultimate truth, examining good and evil, causes and retributions, for the responses are never empty words. The foolish submit to fate, dismissing it as false. How pitiable are those who suffer the Three Offices' torments in the mire of bitterness!\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: In the ancient era of Red Clarity, there was a Daoist named Zheng Ren’an. His merit incomplete, he died in the northern hills of Changshan among the Rong barbarians. His son, Zhongming, studied under Master Xuanhe and used this text to pacify Ren’an’s bodily form and dwelling for thirty years. Ren’an was delivered and was to return to the human realm, but his remains were burned by hunters, whereupon his bodily form rose in dense smoke. Now he serves as the Venerable Lord of the Southern Palace of the Supreme Heavenly Court. The traces of his attainment are inscribed upon the Southern Pavilion of the Great Ultimate’s Upper Palace, recorded with perfect clarity.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: In the land of Shànrěn, there was a Daoist surnamed Huǎng, styled Xinran, who studied under the Eternal Youth and received the transmission of the *Lingbao* rites for extinguishing death and ascending to heaven. His merit incomplete, he died in the Green Origin Mountains, his remains buried on the Isle of Flowing Life. The Eternal Youth used this text to pacify his bodily form. After a hundred years, when a great flood swept it away, he transformed and was reborn. Now he is honored as the Venerable Lord of Primordial Numinosity, and his Daoist traces are recorded in the Southern Palace, housed within the Purple Tenuity’s Hall.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: In the world of Abandoned Worthies, there was a Daoist named Hao Fuming. From youth, he loved mountains and rivers, abandoning his home to wander afar. His merit incomplete, he died beneath the Earth-Mirror Mountain.\n\nHis son, Shaoxin, studied this text under Master Beiguo and used it to pacify Fuming’s bodily form for seven hundred years. Refined by water and fire, he was restored to the realm of humans. Later, he became a disciple of Master Heiwenzi, received the transmission for ascending to heaven, and is now honored as the Emperor of Mystic Elders. The Southern Palace has recorded his Daoist traces, housed within the Northern Origin’s Mystic Window.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: In the Middle Prime Heaven’s Southern Fuli world, there was a Daoist named Wang, styled Duming. From youth, he traveled to study and received from Master Tu Zhen’gong the transmission of the Five Scrolls for ascending as an immortal. His merit incomplete, he died in the eastern mountains’ broad and numinous hollows. His son, Jingxiu, sought out Master Dai Zhongjun and received this text to pacify his father’s bodily form for ninety years. When the great famine struck the eastern mountains and people dug the earth for food, they uncovered his remains, and he immediately transformed and was reborn. Later, his Dao perfected, he ascended to heaven and became the Perfected of Scenic Radiance.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: These masters all accumulated learning to extinguish death, their Dao nearly complete, and thus received this text to return to life among humans. All transcended the void, stepped through the emptiness, ascended to the Golden Gates, and received their titles by nature. These events are not remote, yet they remain obscure to the world. Examining those closer to our time: Master Yanmenzi’s teacher was Yeguang; Master Gaoqiuzi’s teacher was Master Shi; and Master Hongya’s teacher was the Metal Mother. All received the *Lingbao* rites for extinguishing death, the Five Refining Methods, and the transmission for ascending to heaven. Yanmenzi died on Changqiu Mountain in Lu County, Yuyang. Gaoqiuzi died on Gaofu Mountain in Wenxi County, Zhongshan. Master Hongya died in Lang Mountain, Gusu County, Wuwei. All received this text to pacify their tombs. Yanmenzi’s tomb collapsed after forty years, and his form transformed; later, he entered the Golden Court of the Great Cavern on Meng Mountain and received the scriptures as an Immortal Minister. Gaoqiuzi’s tomb was opened after seventy-two years by people who found his coffin decayed and his form flown away; he is now the Perfected of Central Marchmount. Master Hongya’s tomb opened after one hundred twenty years, his bodily form soaring aloft; he received the scriptures and became the Perfected of Green City. These worthies all received the methods for extinguishing death, the transmission for ascending to heaven, and the Dao of pacifying the numinous, thereby attaining lofty emptiness, treading the clear void, riding the high clouds, and roaming the Purple Tenuity. They received their titles as Perfected Ones. These recent events are no longer distant legends.\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly King commanded the unveiling of the Primordial’s treasure repository to proclaim to the Supreme Immortals of the Great Ultimate: those who encounter this will have their names recorded in the Upper Clarity for ten thousand kalpas of past lives and attain the immortal Dao. All heavenly men and women must heed the words of the *Nüqing*, treasuring and guarding them in secret.\n\nThe *Lingbao* Five Immortals’ Refining and Pacifying Numinous Yellow Silk Chapter Rites are now complete.",

Together, they shall receive transformation and rebirth.\n\nToday is a day of great jubilation, as boundless souls are delivered. All who are to be delivered shall be so, none excluded.

Refined by water and fire, he was restored to the realm of humans. Later, he became a disciple of Master Heiwenzi, received the transmission for ascending to heaven, and is now honored as the Emperor of Mystic Elders. The Southern Palace has recorded his Daoist traces, housed within the Northern Origin’s Mystic Window.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: In the Middle Prime Heaven’s Southern Fuli world, there was a Daoist named Wang, styled Duming. From youth, he traveled to study and received from Master Tu Zhen’gong the transmission of the Five Scrolls for ascending as an immortal. His merit incomplete, he died in the eastern mountains’ broad and numinous hollows. His son, Jingxiu, sought out Master Dai Zhongjun and received this text to pacify his father’s bodily form for ninety years. When the great famine struck the eastern mountains and people dug the earth for food, they uncovered his remains, and he immediately transformed and was reborn. Later, his Dao perfected, he ascended to heaven and became the Perfected of Scenic Radiance.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: These masters all accumulated learning to extinguish death, their Dao nearly complete, and thus received this text to return to life among humans. All transcended the void, stepped through the emptiness, ascended to the Golden Gates, and received their titles by nature. These events are not remote, yet they remain obscure to the world. Examining those closer to our time: Master Yanmenzi’s teacher was Yeguang; Master Gaoqiuzi’s teacher was Master Shi; and Master Hongya’s teacher was the Metal Mother. All received the *Lingbao* rites for extinguishing death, the Five Refining Methods, and the transmission for ascending to heaven. Yanmenzi died on Changqiu Mountain in Lu County, Yuyang. Gaoqiuzi died on Gaofu Mountain in Wenxi County, Zhongshan. Master Hongya died in Lang Mountain, Gusu County, Wuwei. All received this text to pacify their tombs. Yanmenzi’s tomb collapsed after forty years, and his form transformed; later, he entered the Golden Court of the Great Cavern on Meng Mountain and received the scriptures as an Immortal Minister. Gaoqiuzi’s tomb was opened after seventy-two years by people who found his coffin decayed and his form flown away; he is now the Perfected of Central Marchmount. Master Hongya’s tomb opened after one hundred twenty years, his bodily form soaring aloft; he received the scriptures and became the Perfected of Green City. These worthies all received the methods for extinguishing death, the transmission for ascending to heaven, and the Dao of pacifying the numinous, thereby attaining lofty emptiness, treading the clear void, riding the high clouds, and roaming the Purple Tenuity. They received their titles as Perfected Ones. These recent events are no longer distant legends.\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly King commanded the unveiling of the Primordial’s treasure repository to proclaim to the Supreme Immortals of the Great Ultimate: those who encounter this will have their names recorded in the Upper Clarity for ten thousand kalpas of past lives and attain the immortal Dao.
