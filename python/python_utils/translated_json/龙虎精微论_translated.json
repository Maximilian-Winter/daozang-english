Let your diet be pure—this is essential.\n\nDo not covet wealth or chase profit.\n\nWhen beginning practice, first employ **Dao Yin** (guided movements). Perform them lightly, opening the channels and pathways. The more varied, the better.\n\nDo not grow weary or exhausted, lest your vital essence be depleted—this is most unwise.\n\n**The Dao Yin Framework** includes the following:\n\n**Swinging the Limbs**\nWith hands, swing wide; with feet, stride boldly. Then lift one foot, suspending it midair, stepping forward as if echoing. Make a sound.\n\n**Mountain-Tossing Hands**\nClasp hands behind, palms upward, release, and lift straight up, pressing down with both feet for a moment.\n\n**Bow-Drawing Stance**\nDraw back hands as if stringing a bow, then twist the torso as if shooting a bird. Repeat left and right.\n\nAlso, clasp hands behind the neck, swaying the upper body and head together.\n\n**Knees and Legs**\nRub the knees vigorously at **Chize (赤泽)**, and perform **dry bathing (乾浴)**. Warm the hands and press them above and below the **Qihai (气海)** acupoint.\n\nClench fingers tightly, making a sharp sound, then **knock the teeth together** and gather the spirit.\n\n**Strike the Heavenly Drum** thirty-six times, pressing the sides of the nose with both hands—this subdues the **Seven Spirits (七魄)**.\n\nCall upon the **Three Souls (三魂)** by name—**Shuangling (爽灵), Taiguang (胎光), Youjing (幽精)**—repeating three or once. First, close and steady the breath, then exhale forcefully to purge stale, corrupt energies.\n\nStretch limbs fully, letting *qi* flow to the fingertips.\n\nVisualize the **Five Celestial Animals**—**Qinglong (青龙), Baihu (白虎), Zhuqiao (朱雀), Xuanwu (玄武)**—surrounding you in yellow *qi* at front, back, left, and right. These are the **true forms of the Five Zang (五脏)**.\n\nThen, calm the breath and still the mind before performing the **Yarrow Stalk Method (打爻)**.\n\n**For the Yang Stalk:**\nWith each stalk, breathe evenly in and out. When exhaling, retain half the breath, then close the passage and, with intent, draw your own **original *qi*** (元气).\n\nThe **original** is the **source**—when raised to the **circular layers above**, drum it down at the **throat center (咽)**. When swallowing, take the left side first, then turn the face right and swallow again, completing **thirty-six swallows**.\n\nIf you begin with three or two swallows, rest for thirty-six, then visualize swallowing down to the **field of elixir (田层环)**, passing through the **stomach’s divine mouth (胃神口)**, entering the **Dan Tian (丹田)**, and exhaling to adjust the breath before performing another stalk.\n\nEach time you swallow, let the *qi* rise with a **gurgling, bubbling sound**.\n\nAfter completing all six stalks—**totaling 216 swallows**—gather the *qi* fully in the Dan Tian. Then, shake the body left and right **five to seven times**, and rub the Qihai to assist.\n\n**Timing:**\nDuring **yang hours (sunlit)**, perform the **Yang Stalk**; during **yin hours (moonlit)**, perform the **Yin Stalk**. Close your eyes, banish all distractions—no thought shall linger.\n\n**The Hours of Zi and Wu** belong to **bathing**—do not practice then.\n\nIf one mistakenly treats **all afternoon as yin** and **all night as yang**, they contradict the true **yin-yang and Five Phases**! Follow this instead:\n- **Afternoon (Wu to Shi)** performs the **Yin Stalk (坤卦)**.\n- **Midnight (Zi to Chen)** performs the **Yang Stalk**.\n\nEach hour corresponds to one stalk. Excluding the initial **144 counts**, the rest follow the same sequence.\n\n**Burning the Scriptures:**\nOnce per season, burn this text in a fire ritual. The method of burning follows the same procedure as your lord’s—briefly stated, not elaborated here.\n\n**What is Practiced Without Fire:**\nThis is the **fire control’s stagnation of impurities**.\n\n**Results:**\nOne year—**minor attainment**,\nTwo years—**full attainment**,\nThree years—**transformation of essence**,\nSix years—**six yin retreat, six yang complete**, and your name is recorded among the immortals.\nNine years—**ascension**.\n\nInitially, take **elixirs** to aid the process, **yin virtue** to support it, and **quietude** to nourish it. Seek one or two like-minded companions to assist.\n\nThe **Dao** is not confined to mountains and forests alone—it may also be cultivated in cities.\n\nOne must not lend out one’s own footwear, garments, or headgear to others, lest it diminish one’s **virtue/power**.\n\nIf near water or woodlands, dwell there as the center.\nIf in walled cities or rugged markets, then take the heights as your place.\n\nThe **Way** of **Zhuangzi** and **Laozi** is the most precious treasure—guard it naturally, and success will follow of its own accord.\n\nThe **source of Dao and virtue**—engrave it, wear it as an amulet, and ponder it deeply.\n\n*—The **Essentials of the Dragon-Tiger** [论] concludes.*",

Let your diet be pure—this is essential.\n\nDo not covet wealth or chase profit.\n\nWhen beginning practice, first employ **Dao Yin** (guided movements). Perform them lightly, opening the channels and pathways. The more varied, the better.\n\nDo not grow weary or exhausted, lest your vital essence be depleted—this is most unwise.\n\n**The Dao Yin Framework** includes the following:\n\n**Swinging the Limbs**\nWith hands, swing wide; with feet, stride boldly. Then lift one foot, suspending it midair, stepping forward as if echoing. Make a sound.\n\n**Mountain-Tossing Hands**\nClasp hands behind, palms upward, release, and lift straight up, pressing down with both feet for a moment.\n\n**Bow-Drawing Stance**\nDraw back hands as if stringing a bow, then twist the torso as if shooting a bird. Repeat left and right.\n\nAlso, clasp hands behind the neck, swaying the upper body and head together.\n\n**Knees and Legs**\nRub the knees vigorously at **Chize (赤泽)**, and perform **dry bathing (乾浴)**. Warm the hands and press them above and below the **Qihai (气海)** acupoint.\n\nClench fingers tightly, making a sharp sound, then **knock the teeth together** and gather the spirit.\n\n**Strike the Heavenly Drum** thirty-six times, pressing the sides of the nose with both hands—this subdues the **Seven Spirits (七魄)**.\n\nCall upon the **Three Souls (三魂)** by name—**Shuangling (爽灵), Taiguang (胎光), Youjing (幽精)**—repeating three or once. First, close and steady the breath, then exhale forcefully to purge stale, corrupt energies.\n\nStretch limbs fully, letting *qi* flow to the fingertips.\n\nVisualize the **Five Celestial Animals**—**Qinglong (青龙), Baihu (白虎), Zhuqiao (朱雀), Xuanwu (玄武)**—surrounding you in yellow *qi* at front, back, left, and right. These are the **true forms of the Five Zang (五脏)**.\n\nThen, calm the breath and still the mind before performing the **Yarrow Stalk Method (打爻)**.\n\n**For the Yang Stalk:**\nWith each stalk, breathe evenly in and out. When exhaling, retain half the breath, then close the passage and, with intent, draw your own **original *qi*** (元气).\n\nThe **original** is the **source**—when raised to the **circular layers above**, drum it down at the **throat center (咽)**. When swallowing, take the left side first, then turn the face right and swallow again, completing **thirty-six swallows**.\n\nIf you begin with three or two swallows, rest for thirty-six, then visualize swallowing down to the **field of elixir (田层环)**, passing through the **stomach’s divine mouth (胃神口)**, entering the **Dan Tian (丹田)**, and exhaling to adjust the breath before performing another stalk.\n\nEach time you swallow, let the *qi* rise with a **gurgling, bubbling sound**.\n\nAfter completing all six stalks—**totaling 216 swallows**—gather the *qi* fully in the Dan Tian. Then, shake the body left and right **five to seven times**, and rub the Qihai to assist.\n\n**Timing:**\nDuring **yang hours (sunlit)**, perform the **Yang Stalk**; during **yin hours (moonlit)**, perform the **Yin Stalk**. Close your eyes, banish all distractions—no thought shall linger.\n\n**The Hours of Zi and Wu** belong to **bathing**—do not practice then.\n\nIf one mistakenly treats **all afternoon as yin** and **all night as yang**, they contradict the true **yin-yang and Five Phases**! Follow this instead:\n- **Afternoon (Wu to Shi)** performs the **Yin Stalk (坤卦)**.\n- **Midnight (Zi to Chen)** performs the **Yang Stalk**.\n\nEach hour corresponds to one stalk. Excluding the initial **144 counts**, the rest follow the same sequence.\n\n**Burning the Scriptures:**\nOnce per season, burn this text in a fire ritual. The method of burning follows the same procedure as your lord’s—briefly stated, not elaborated here.\n\n**What is Practiced Without Fire:**\nThis is the **fire control’s stagnation of impurities**.\n\n**Results:**\nOne year—**minor attainment**,\nTwo years—**full attainment**,\nThree years—**transformation of essence**,\nSix years—**six yin retreat, six yang complete**, and your name is recorded among the immortals.\nNine years—**ascension**.\n\nInitially, take **elixirs** to aid the process, **yin virtue** to support it, and **quietude** to nourish it. Seek one or two like-minded companions to assist.",
