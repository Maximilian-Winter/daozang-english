Author unknown. Based on the preface’s reference to the \"Tianbao era,\" it is likely a Tang-dynasty work. One fascicle.\n\n*Source of Base Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, Methods category.\n*Collated Edition:* *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel* (included in Volume 60).\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *Master Youzhen’s Oral Instructions on Absorbing the Primordial Qi of the Inner Realm***\n\nWhat the body relies upon is *qi*; what *qi* depends upon is the body. When *qi* is whole, the body is whole; when *qi* is exhausted, the body perishes. Thus, those who cultivate life invariably refine the body and nurture *qi* to preserve their existence. There has never been a body without *qi*, nor *qi* without a body. That body and *qi* require each other to achieve completion—is this not abundantly clear?\n\nI have long admired the supreme Dao and exhaustively studied its scriptures and oral instructions. For over thirty years, I have practiced *qi*-guarding and truth-preservation, yet what I have heard and witnessed has never fully satisfied me. During the Tianbao era, I encountered the Perfected One of Mount Luofu, Master Wang, who had returned from the Northern Marchmount. Leaning on his staff at a post-house, he regarded me with familiarity. I suspected he was an extraordinary person. Drawing near, I spoke with him and found him indeed a gentleman of the Dao beyond the world.\n\nMoved by my earnestness, he transmitted to me the arts of exhalation and inhalation, along with the essentials of dual-body governance. The boundless grace of his instruction defies expression in words. He often said that the ultimate essentials of the Dao are not found in scriptures but are all transmitted orally. The *Two Radiances*, *Five Sprouts*, *Six Wu*, and various *qi*-absorption methods pertain to *external qi*. External *qi* is fierce and unyielding, unsuitable for those of the mundane world to absorb. As for *internal qi*, it is the *embryonic breathing* inherent within the body, not to be sought externally. Without encountering a Perfected One, one cannot receive the oral instructions; all efforts will be in vain, and no achievement will ever come.\n\nThe methods recorded here all derive from the Perfected One’s essential teachings, elucidated for clarity. They are not the arbitrary conclusions of my own ignorance. Master Wang often told me: \"The Venerable Lord said, ‘My life is in my hands, not in Heaven’s.’ He also said, ‘I share with Heaven and Earth a single *qi* by which all things are ordered—how could Heaven and Earth determine my life and death?’ These are truly the essential words of truth. Those who practice the Dao should ponder them repeatedly, reverently heeding his guidance. How could I not prostrate myself in obedience?\"\n\nHaving fortuitously obtained these instructions, one must transmit them with care, lest their reckless disclosure invite misfortune.\n\n---\n\n**Master Youzhen’s Oral Instructions on Absorbing the Primordial Qi of the Inner Realm**\n\n**Chapter One: The Method of Advancing and Receiving**\n\nWhenever one wishes to absorb *qi*, one must first select a high, dry, and pure space. The chamber need not be large, but it must be free of drafts. Incense should be burned constantly on either side, and one must avoid foul or polluted air. The mat should be thick and soft, with the feet slightly elevated.\n\n**Master Youzhen’s Oral Instructions on Absorbing the Primordial Qi of the Inner Realm**\n\n**Chapter One: The Method of Advancing and Receiving** *(continued)*\n\nThe *Zhen’gao* states: *\"When the mat is high, the ghosts’ breath cannot reach.\"* This means that ghosts and spirits often use the *qi* of the earth to afflict people with harm, so a mat three feet high will suffice. The bedding should be adjusted to suit the cold or warmth, with winter slightly warmer being especially good. The pillow should be two *cun* high, level with the back.\n\nWhenever one reaches the time after midnight when *qi* is born, or upon first awakening before dawn, one must first blow out the turbid and foul *qi* from the abdomen, stopping after nine exhalations. To speak more precisely, this is not limited to the pre-dawn hour; whenever the *qi* of heaven is harmonious and the abdomen is empty, one may proceed.\n\nFirst, close the eyes and tap the teeth thirty-six times to awaken the body’s spirits. When finished, use the fingers to press the inner and outer corners of the eyes, massage the nose, rotate the ears left and right, and rub the face and eyes—this is the method for the true person’s daily rising. Additionally, one may perform *daoyin* exercises as the occasion demands to circulate the joints.\n\nThen, press the tongue against the upper palate, stirring the inner and outer fluids of the mouth. When the mouth is full, swallow the fluid, guiding it down into the stomach while visualizing the stomach spirit receiving it. Do this three times and stop. This is called \"rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid,\" which irrigates the five viscera and makes the face radiant. The general approach is largely the same.\n\nThen, let the spirit settle utterly, making the mind like withered wood and the body as empty as discarded clothing. Inwardly gaze and reverse the hearing, casting aside all thoughts. Only then may one begin the absorption.\n\nFor every step, keep the eyes closed and the hands clenched in *wo gu* (grasping the solid). Only when dispersing *qi* should the fingers be unfurled. The purpose of *wo gu* is to close the passes and guard against the intrusion of essence and evil. For beginners in *qi*-absorption, whose *qi*-pathways are not yet open, *wo gu* should not be used. Only after a hundred days or half a year, when the *qi* flows smoothly and sweat appears in the palms, may one adopt *wo gu*.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* says:\n*\"Close the three passes and grasp the solid to halt,\nRinse and swallow the golden liquor, ingest the jade blossoms.\nThus the three worms perish without need for food,\nAnd long practice naturally brings flourishing.\"*\n\n**Chapter Two: The Method of Dredging Qi**\n\nThe method states: Each of the five viscera possesses its own proper *qi*. When lying down at night, after closing the breath and awakening, one must first ensure that any undigested food is dissolved so that the *qi* may be expelled before beginning to regulate and absorb it.\n\nThe technique is as follows: Close the eyes and clench the hands in *wo gu*. Lie on the back, place the fists between the breasts, raise the knees, arch the back and buttocks, and hold the breath to drum the *qi* in the *qi*-sea, turning it from within outward. Exhale with a *he* sound, nine or eighteen times, and stop. This is called \"dredging the *qi*.\" When finished, regulate it.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Method of Regulating Qi**\n\nThe method states: The nose is the Gate of Heaven, and the mouth is the Door of Earth. Thus, the nose should be used for inhalation and the mouth for exhalation. One must not err in this, for error causes *qi* to rebel, and rebellious *qi* generates illness. Be especially cautious during exhalation and inhalation.\n\nDo not let the breath be audible to the ears. Regulate it five, seven, or nine times until it is harmonious. This is called \"regulating the *qi*.\" When finished, swallow it. At night, when sleeping, keep the mouth closed and do not exhale through it.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Method of Swallowing Qi**\n\nThe method states: The subtlety of absorbing inner *qi* lies in swallowing *qi*. Worldly people swallow external *qi*, mistaking it for inner *qi*, unable to distinguish between them—how could this not be mistaken? Practitioners of exhalation and inhalation must proceed with care to avoid error.\n\nAll people receive the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth to form their bodies, and within the body, the primordial *qi* naturally governs. Whenever one swallows or exhales and inhales, the inner *qi* responds to the outer *qi*. Naturally, the *qi* in the *qi*-sea rises with the exhalation, reaching the throat. Just as the exhalation reaches its limit, promptly close the mouth, drum the throat, and swallow, causing a gurgling sound. Then, for men, guide it down the left side; for women, the right, through the twenty-four joints, like flowing water, distinctly audible.\n\nThus, the inner *qi* and outer *qi* are clearly distinguished. With intention, guide it, and with the hand, rub it to hasten its descent into the *qi*-sea. The *qi*-sea is three *cun* below the navel, also called the lower *dantian*.\n\nFor beginners in *qi*-absorption, if the upper burner is not yet open, rubbing with the hand will hasten its descent. Once the flow is unimpeded, rubbing is unnecessary. After closing the mouth, perform three consecutive swallows and stop. Dry swallowing is called \"cloud movement.\" Swallowing with fluid, using the saliva in the mouth, is called \"rain bestowal.\"\n\nFor beginners whose *qi* has not yet circulated, each swallow should be followed by immediate circulation; one must not hastily proceed to three consecutive swallows. Only when the *qi* flows smoothly may one gradually increase the number, progressing toward minor attainment. After one year, the flow may become unimpeded; after three years of practice, one may absorb *qi* freely.\n\nFor those newly practicing *qi*-absorption whose pathways are not yet open, if a swallow does not descend, use a single swallow as a marker. Simply ensure that it descends with a gurgling sound, straight into the *qi*-sea.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Method of Circulating Qi**\n\nThe method states: The lower *dantian* is near two posterior cavities that connect to the spinal channel, ascending to the *niwan*. The *niwan* is the name for the palace of the brain.\n\nAfter every three consecutive swallows, swiftly visualize the lower *dantian* and guide the obtained inner primordial *qi* with intention into the two cavities. Then imagine two strands of white *qi* rising on either side of the spine, directly entering the *niwan*. The *qi* steams through all the palaces, pervading the hair, face, head, neck, arms, and fingers all at once, descending into the chest to the middle *dantian*. The middle *dantian* is the spirit of the heart palace.\n\nIt irrigates the five viscera, then returns to the lower *dantian*, reaching the three stars, traversing the knees, shins, and ankles, and descending to the *yongquan*. The *yongquan* is the center of the sole.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"governing with a single *qi*,\" drumming it like thunder and moistening it like wind and rain. Just as the earth has springs, without thunder to stir and drum them, they cannot nourish the myriad things. If one does not expel the turbid and foul *qi*, it will cause unease. Though one may have fluids suitable for rinsing and swallowing, and though they may irrigate the five viscera and bring forth radiance, they ultimately cannot return essence to replenish the brain.\n\nWithout intercourse, one cannot guide it upward to swallow and internally refine it; without exhalation and inhalation, one cannot draw upon and employ it. Thus, the Dao of circulation and the principle of application are such that, emulating heaven and earth, one visualizes the turbid, foul, stagnant, and pathogenic *qi*, along with congealed blood within the body, being purged by the upright *qi* and expelled through the fingertips and toes—this is called \"dispersing *qi*.\" Then, extend the hands and fingers without clenching them. Each such cycle constitutes one passage; when the passages are unobstructed, illness is absent. One then readjusts, as if guiding the hands, though guiding the hands is again difficult. Drum and swallow as before, closing the *qi* and drumming it to swallow, reaching thirty-six breaths—this is called \"minor attainment.\"\n\nIf one has not yet ceased taking grains, one should eat sparingly at this stage, ensuring the abdomen remains empty and serene. Whether sitting or otherwise, whenever the abdomen is empty, swallow. From dawn to dusk, performing this ten times naturally yields three hundred and sixty swallows. If one has long practiced *qi* breathing and suddenly performs three hundred and sixty swallows, this is also called \"minor attainment.\" One thousand two hundred swallows are called \"major attainment,\" or \"great embryonic breathing.\" Simply closing the *qi* and counting to one thousand two hundred breaths is also \"major attainment,\" though the complexion will lack radiance.\n\nThere are also methods for refining *qi*, closing *qi*, yielding *qi*, and distributing *qi*, along with various essential techniques, all enumerated in the text. Those of like mind should study them carefully.\n\n**Method Six: Refining *Qi***\n\nThe method states: To refine the form by ingesting *qi*, enter a chamber when slightly at leisure. Remove clothing, let the hair down, lie supine, and extend the hands without clenching them. Comb the hair to ensure it flows freely onto the mat. Distribute the *qi*, then regulate and swallow it. After swallowing, close the *qi* and wait until it reaches its limit. Then, still the mind and extinguish thoughts, allowing the *qi* to flow freely and unobstructed. If oppressed, exhale; if panting, regulate the breath. Once the *qi* is calm, refine it again. Perform this ten times, then cease.\n\nFor those newly practicing *qi* ingestion who have not yet achieved free flow, begin with one cycle when at leisure, gradually increasing to ten. Once unobstructed, gradually increase to twenty or fifty, until the entire body sweats—this is the sign of efficacy. Calm the mind and harmonize the *qi*, avoiding exposure to drafts. This is the excellent defense for reversing aging and prolonging life. Perform this only when the fluids are clear and refreshed; if the *qi* is muddled or drowsiness arises, do not proceed. Practice diligently, and when the four limbs feel heavy or restless, perform this method—not necessarily daily, but whenever one feels clear and refreshed, whether every ten or five days.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* states: \"A thousand disasters vanish, a hundred illnesses heal; one need not fear the ferocity of tigers and wolves, and thus aging is reversed, and years prolonged.\"\n\n**Method Seven: Yielding *Qi***\n\nThe method states: The technique of yielding *qi* can be practiced when the body’s *qi* is harmonious, the spirit and body are regulated and smooth, and regardless of whether one is walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. Simply follow the gateways to regulate the *qi*. Whether reclining in a grove or sitting in stillness, free the mind of thoughts and awareness, sinking into profound tranquility, making the heart like the vast emptiness. Then regulate and close the *qi*, whether ten or twenty breaths, allowing the *qi* to flow freely without contention from the will. After a long while, the *qi* will exit through the pores of the skin, no longer exhaled through the mouth. Even if there is some residual, it is negligible. Regulate and repeat, striving to reach dozens of breaths—this is even better. It can be practiced while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. With diligent practice, the hundred passages open, the complexion becomes radiant, the spirit refreshed, and the *qi* clear, as if one has just bathed. Whenever there is disharmony, practice this method, and one will again feel at peace.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* states: \"Sitting upright in non-action, the hun and po are at peace; the spirit is clear, and I am truly one with it.\"\n\n**Method Eight: Closing *Qi***\n\nThe method states: If, due to improper cultivation, illness unexpectedly arises, swiftly retire to a secluded chamber and follow the *qi*-ingestion method. Arrange the hands and feet, then regulate and swallow the *qi*. Focus the mind on the afflicted area, close the *qi*, and direct it with intention to attack the ailment. When the *qi* reaches its limit, exhale, then swallow again in succession, continuing the attack as before. If the *qi* becomes strained, cease; when it is regulated, attack again. Perform this twenty to fifty times until the afflicted area sweats and feels unobstructed, then stop. If the ailment persists, practice this method at midnight, before dawn, or repeatedly during the day, directing the *qi* with intention. If the illness is in the head, face, hands, or feet, attack only the afflicted area—there is no ailment that will not be cured. Thus, the *qi* commanded by the mind is more effective than the hands, as if aided by spirits, its power beyond comprehension.\n\n**Method Nine: Distributing *Qi***\n\nThe method states: When intending to distribute *qi* to heal another’s illness, first determine the afflicted organ based on the patient’s symptoms, then draw *qi* from the corresponding direction and infuse it into the patient’s body. Have the patient face that direction, calm the mind, and purify the thoughts before distributing the *qi*. After distribution, instruct the patient to swallow the *qi*, and malevolent spirits will flee, while pathogenic *qi* will be permanently expelled.\n\n**Method Ten: The Six *Qi***\n\nThe method states: The six *qi* are *xu*, *he*, *si*, *chui*, *hu*, and *xi*. Five of the *qi* correspond to the five viscera, while the remaining one governs the triple burner.\n\n*Si* corresponds to the lungs, which govern the nose. For cold, heat, or disharmony in the nose, or extreme fatigue, practice *si* exhalation and inhalation to regulate the skin and treat sores and scabies. For such ailments, apply the method accordingly, and healing will be immediate.\n\n*He* corresponds to the heart, which governs the tongue. For dry mouth, rough tongue, or obstructed *qi*, as well as various pathogenic *qi*, use *he* to expel them. For great heat, open the mouth wide to *he*; for slight heat, open it slightly. Intentional focus is required for proper regulation.\n\n*Hu* corresponds to the spleen, which governs the central palace. For mild heat, disharmony, abdominal and stomach distension, or *qi* stagnation, use *hu* to regulate.\n\n*Chui* corresponds to the kidneys, which govern the ears. For coldness in the waist and abdomen or decline of yang vitality, use *chui* to regulate.\n\n*Xu* corresponds to the liver, which connects to the eyes. As the saying goes: \"When the liver is excessive, the eyes turn red.\"\n\nWhen illness arises, use *xu* to regulate it.\n\n*Xi* corresponds to the Triple Burner. For disharmony in the Triple Burner, use *xi* to regulate.\n\nThough each *qi* governs its respective domain, when the five viscera, Triple Burner, cold-heat, exhaustion, or unregulated wind pathogens are involved, all pertain to the heart. The heart governs *he*; using *he* to regulate all such illnesses will bring healing, and the six *qi* need not be employed.\n\n**Method for Harmonizing Fluids, Verse Ten**\nThe verse states: Humans consume the five flavors, each of which returns to its respective viscus. Every viscus generates turbid *qi*, which together emerge from the mouth. Moreover, the *qi* of the six breaths and Triple Burner all pass through this gate, converging with myriad impurities to form turbid *qi*.\n\nUpon waking from sleep, *qi* issues from the mouth, its odor unbearable. Examine and observe this to discern its signs. Whenever the mouth is parched, bitter, or the tongue rough; when the palate frequently lacks moisture or swallowing saliva causes throat pain and prevents eating—these are signs of extreme heat. Immediately open the mouth wide to *he*, ensuring each exhalation exits through the proper passage. After ten or twenty *he*, strike the Heavenly Drum seven or nine times, then gather the fluid from the Flower Pool beneath the tongue and swallow it. Repeat *he* and swallowing until the heat and fever subside. When sweet spring water flows in the mouth, the heat has retreated and the five viscera are cooled.\n\nIf the mouth’s fluids are cold and tasteless, or if excessive *he* leaves the heart unsettled, food and drink lose their savor, and water is rejected—these are signs of cold. Then use *chui* to warm it, following the method for warming cold. Wait until the mouth savors sweetness and the heart feels harmoniously warm before stopping.\n\nThe *Yellow Court Classic* states:\n*\"The Jade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root—*\n*Those who cultivate it with care may endure forever.\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"Rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid keeps calamity at bay.\"*\n\n**Method for Regulating Diet, Verse Twelve**\nThe verse states: After practicing *qi*-absorption, food must follow a proper sequence. Permissible foods are beneficial; forbidden foods are harmful. Harmful foods should be permanently avoided, while beneficial ones should be consistently consumed.\n\nEach morning at dawn, consume a small portion of plain watery congee or sesame congee, which greatly benefits the person, regulates spleen *qi*, and replenishes bodily fluids. At midday, plain wheat or barley cakes and steamed buns are excellent, provided they are not eaten while scalding hot, as this disrupts the proper *qi*. Onion dumpling soup is also beneficial. Rice should be made from non-glutinous rice or barley, which are nourishing.\n\nFor those practicing *qi*-absorption, these foods are suitable throughout the four seasons, though they need not be eaten daily. Follow one’s inclination at the time. If desired, dried venison is also beneficial. However, during purification fasts, it must not be consumed. On the thirty-six spirit days of the zodiac, when the corresponding animal signs are taboo, avoid eating them; dates, chestnuts, and steamed cakes may be eaten instead.\n\nOne may endure hunger but must never overeat, for satiety harms the heart and makes *qi* circulation especially difficult. Hot cakes, turnip soup, and the like are strictly forbidden! Strictly forbidden! Salty, sour, and pungent foods should be gradually reduced.\n\nAfter each meal, immediately *he* to expel the toxic turbid *qi* from the mouth, and no illness will arise. For those practicing *qi*-absorption, the intestines and stomach are empty and pure; raw, cold, sour, slippery, sticky, greasy, stale, hard, putrid, or indigestible foods must not be eaten. If such foods are accidentally consumed, the area where even a single bite lodges will surely ache slightly. Beware!\n\nOnly soft foods are appropriate. Before eating, first swallow three to five mouthfuls of *qi*, then consume the food, allowing the *qi* to take the lead. Additionally, swallowing three to five grains of raw Sichuan pepper is beneficial. After eating, swallow three more grains. This substance aids digestion, guides *qi* downward, unblocks the Triple Burner, benefits the five viscera, expels turbidity, dissolves stagnant food, and assists the upright *qi*. It is suitable for long-term use, as it dispels cold, summerheat, and dampness; brightens the eyes; promotes hair growth; and regulates *qi*. Its merits are too numerous to list in full—they are detailed in the *Great Clarity Classic*.\n\nThere is a separate method for consuming Sichuan pepper: when *qi* descends and causes diarrhea, expel it promptly. Beware of retention, for retention may lead to illness.\n\nWhen the stomach is empty, drinking one or two cups of clear wine as one pleases is highly beneficial. In winter, it warms; in summer, it cools. It assists the upright *qi* and dispels all pathogens—its merits are not insignificant. The danger lies in excess, for overindulgence leads to drunkenness, which harms the spirit and shortens life. If one encounters a situation of respect or necessity and cannot refuse, drink, but upon release, *he* three to five times. After drinking, open the mouth wide and *he* ten or more times to expel the toxins of fermentation and regulate the *qi*.\n\nOrdinarily, drinking one or two *sheng* slowly is not intoxicating, nor does it interfere with eating or diminish the flavor of food—it remains as before. Do not approach childbirth, death, or the six livestock, nor any filthy or unclean *qi*; even nearing them is inappropriate, let alone drawing close. This is most unsuitable for the upright *qi*.\n\nIf one unexpectedly encounters such impurities, quickly close the *qi*, face upwind, close the eyes, and pass swiftly. Then seek one or two cups of wine to cleanse the body. If one feels the *qi* has entered the abdomen and causes discomfort, immediately regulate the *qi* to expel the turbidity, then inhale fresh *qi* and direct it with the mind. Massage the area with the hand, then swallow Sichuan pepper and drink one or two cups of wine to disperse it. If it refuses to disperse, do not force regulation; let it exit naturally without distress. However, if the upper burner becomes congested, regulation is ultimately necessary to restore harmony.\n\nFoods that are greasy, oily, or pungent severely offend the upright *qi*—be vigilant in avoiding them. One should recognize past transgressions and refrain from repeating them.\n\nThus, after practicing *qi*-absorption for one year, *qi* flows smoothly; after two years, the blood is replete; after three years, the achievement is complete. The primordial *qi* becomes dense and substantial, and even if one encounters transgressions, they cannot cause harm. Swallowing a thousand mouthfuls of *qi* daily is not excessive. Rejuvenation and the return to youth gradually begin from this.\n\n*Qi* transforms into fluids, fluids into blood, blood into essence, essence into marrow, and marrow into sinews.\n\nAfter one year, the *qi* is renewed; after two years, the blood is renewed; after three years, the vessels are renewed; after four years, the flesh is renewed; after five years, the marrow is renewed; after six years, the sinews are renewed; after seven years, the bones are renewed; after eight years, the hair is renewed; after nine years, the form is renewed. Then the thirty-six thousand true spirits within the body all transform into immortal youths, and one is called a *zhenren*.\n\nWith diligent and unceasing practice, the joints become interconnected, and the five viscera grow firm. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"Thousands upon thousands, hundreds upon hundreds, linked in succession—each tenfold, like layered mountains.\"* Thus, internal *qi* does not leak out, and external *qi* does not enter; neither cold nor heat can invade, nor can weapons cause harm. One ascends and transforms, and longevity becomes equal to the Three Luminaries.\n\n**Method Thirteen: The Art of Abandoning Grain**\nThe method states: If one wishes to abandon grain, simply persist in diligent practice as before. After three years, when the upright *qi* flows smoothly, the marrow is replete, the bones are full, the hundred spirits guard their positions, and the Three Corpses flee—then one gradually loses the desire for the *qi* of the five flavors. Constantly contemplating fasting, one may cease eating when the desire fades, and it will not be difficult. Whenever hunger is felt, one should swallow *qi*, regardless of time or quantity. Over time, one naturally understands the proper timing, and no further explanation is needed. What need is there for medicinal substances?\n\nGenerally, those who rely on medicines often fail to cultivate *qi*. They spend their days preoccupied with herbs, yet their bodies never grow refined and solid. Though they may achieve some results, this is not the focus of superior practitioners. As the *Huangting Jing* states:\n*\"The grains’ essence is the earth’s vitality,\nThe five flavors’ external allure reeks of demonic filth.\nThey befoul the spirit and scatter the primordial *qi*—\nHow could one reverse aging and return to infancy?\nWhy not consume the *qi* of Great Harmony?\nThus one may enter the Yellow Tranquility without dying.\"*\n\nThis is the meaning.\n\n**Method Fourteen: The Art of Preserving the True**\n\n**Method Fifteen: The Art of Qi Ingestion and Embryonic Breathing**\n\nThe method states: Most people in the world indulge in desires, harming life and cutting short their destiny—this has been true from ancient times to the present. If one does not take early precautions, how can regret avail anything later? When a person nears death, they begin to cherish their body and life; once guilt is certain, they think to seek good deeds; when illness has already taken hold, they seek medicine. Yet the net of heaven has already been cast—how can it be saved? Thus, the wise and sagacious, valuing their life before its end, guard against misfortune before it arises, and treat illness before it takes root. They cast off worldly robes, gather their minds, and return to the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is *qi*; *qi* is the master of the heart; the master is essence; essence is the root of life. Cherish essence and value *qi*, and only then will life be truly valued—this is the path to balance. As the *Huangting Jing* states:\n*\"Guard closely within the square inch of your heart,\nAnd spirit and vitality will return, restoring youth and strength.\nNurture the jade-tree child as if it were your staff,\nHasten to secure your essence and repay yourself.\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"For long life, be most cautious in the chamber—\nWhy cause your spirit to weep in death?\nIf the sea of essence is drained and a hundred streams pour out,\nThe leaves fall, the tree withers, and verdant youth is lost.\"*\n\nThose who attain long life and enduring vision do so only by cherishing essence and preserving *qi*. The way of the inner elixir and the art of inner cultivation are unknown to the world. Even those who diligently cultivate *qi* but do not sever desire will not escape calamity. Thus it is said: Man loses the Dao—the Dao does not lose man; man does not know life—life does not abandon man. The cultivated gentleman preserves and reflects upon himself.\n\n**The Art of Qi Ingestion and Embryonic Breathing**\nThe method states: Essence is *qi*; *qi* is the Dao. First, knock the teeth together thirty-six times, then turn the head to the right in a full circle, stretching the neck like a turtle. With embryonic breathing, when *qi* rises to the throat, swallow it. Do this three times, then close the mouth. Rub the tongue inside and outside the mouth, gathering saliva, rinsing it until the mouth is full, then tilt the head back and swallow. This nourishes the *Niwan* (the upper elixir field, located at the crown of the head) and moistens the five viscera. Laozi said: *\"Sweet rain nourishes the myriad things; embryonic fluid moistens the five viscera.\"* If one does this day and night without ceasing, one becomes a true person, attaining immortality above and longevity below. For any illness or suffering in the body, visualize *qi* being sent to the afflicted area, and it will be cured. True *qi* expels turbid *qi*, surging upward and purging downward. When the spirit feels clear and refreshed, *qi* naturally harmonizes.\n\nThus the sages have said: Man exists within *qi*, and *qi* exists within man; man does not depart from *qi*, nor *qi* from man. Man relies on *qi* to live and loses *qi* in death. The principle of life and death lies entirely in *qi*. If one can master the art of *qi*, even death cannot claim them. Therefore, at midnight and the fifth watch, stretch out both legs, clench the fists, and extend the hands five inches from the body. The pillow should not exceed two inches in height. Close the eyes and swallow as before. After washing and grooming, warm a cup of wine and drink it to enhance embryonic breathing, moisten the six bowels, guide *qi*, and seal the hundred meridians. This is the secret method of the immortals of Mount Emei—ineffable and profound.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Spiritual mushrooms and jade blossoms reside within the belly. Seeking medicines in famous mountains and great marshes strays far from the Dao. My Way is exceedingly simple—if one can but practice it: Upon rising early, stretch out both legs, regulate the breath, clasp the hands behind the head, pull forward with the hands while pulling backward with the head, and pause. Do this three times. Then interlock the fingers, pull forward three or two times, and tug left and right three or two times. Finally, swallow saliva twenty times. If the four limbs feel unbalanced, rinse the mouth with saliva thirty or twenty times and swallow, and the *qi* will flow smoothly, curing illness swiftly. This method is priceless and must not be lightly transmitted. If imparted to the unworthy, calamity will extend to three generations.\"*\n\nHere ends the method of Master Youzhen on ingesting the inner primordial *qi*.",

Author unknown. Based on the preface’s reference to the \"Tianbao era,\" it is likely a Tang-dynasty work. One fascicle.\n\n*Source of Base Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, Methods category.\n*Collated Edition:* *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel* (included in Volume 60).\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *Master Youzhen’s Oral Instructions on Absorbing the Primordial Qi of the Inner Realm***\n\nWhat the body relies upon is *qi*; what *qi* depends upon is the body. When *qi* is whole, the body is whole; when *qi* is exhausted, the body perishes. Thus, those who cultivate life invariably refine the body and nurture *qi* to preserve their existence. There has never been a body without *qi*, nor *qi* without a body. That body and *qi* require each other to achieve completion—is this not abundantly clear?\n\nI have long admired the supreme Dao and exhaustively studied its scriptures and oral instructions. For over thirty years, I have practiced *qi*-guarding and truth-preservation, yet what I have heard and witnessed has never fully satisfied me. During the Tianbao era, I encountered the Perfected One of Mount Luofu, Master Wang, who had returned from the Northern Marchmount. Leaning on his staff at a post-house, he regarded me with familiarity. I suspected he was an extraordinary person. Drawing near, I spoke with him and found him indeed a gentleman of the Dao beyond the world.\n\nMoved by my earnestness, he transmitted to me the arts of exhalation and inhalation, along with the essentials of dual-body governance. The boundless grace of his instruction defies expression in words. He often said that the ultimate essentials of the Dao are not found in scriptures but are all transmitted orally. The *Two Radiances*, *Five Sprouts*, *Six Wu*, and various *qi*-absorption methods pertain to *external qi*. External *qi* is fierce and unyielding, unsuitable for those of the mundane world to absorb. As for *internal qi*, it is the *embryonic breathing* inherent within the body, not to be sought externally. Without encountering a Perfected One, one cannot receive the oral instructions; all efforts will be in vain, and no achievement will ever come.\n\nThe methods recorded here all derive from the Perfected One’s essential teachings, elucidated for clarity. They are not the arbitrary conclusions of my own ignorance. Master Wang often told me: \"The Venerable Lord said, ‘My life is in my hands, not in Heaven’s.’ He also said, ‘I share with Heaven and Earth a single *qi* by which all things are ordered—how could Heaven and Earth determine my life and death?’ These are truly the essential words of truth. Those who practice the Dao should ponder them repeatedly, reverently heeding his guidance. How could I not prostrate myself in obedience?\"\n\nHaving fortuitously obtained these instructions, one must transmit them with care, lest their reckless disclosure invite misfortune.\n\n---\n\n**Master Youzhen’s Oral Instructions on Absorbing the Primordial Qi of the Inner Realm**\n\n**Chapter One: The Method of Advancing and Receiving**\n\nWhenever one wishes to absorb *qi*, one must first select a high, dry, and pure space. The chamber need not be large, but it must be free of drafts. Incense should be burned constantly on either side, and one must avoid foul or polluted air. The mat should be thick and soft, with the feet slightly elevated.",

      "translated_text": "**Master Youzhen’s Oral Instructions on Absorbing the Primordial Qi of the Inner Realm**\n\n**Chapter One: The Method of Advancing and Receiving** *(continued)*\n\nThe *Zhen’gao* states: *\"When the mat is high, the ghosts’ breath cannot reach.\"* This means that ghosts and spirits often use the *qi* of the earth to afflict people with harm, so a mat three feet high will suffice. The bedding should be adjusted to suit the cold or warmth, with winter slightly warmer being especially good. The pillow should be two *cun* high, level with the back.\n\nWhenever one reaches the time after midnight when *qi* is born, or upon first awakening before dawn, one must first blow out the turbid and foul *qi* from the abdomen, stopping after nine exhalations. To speak more precisely, this is not limited to the pre-dawn hour; whenever the *qi* of heaven is harmonious and the abdomen is empty, one may proceed.\n\nFirst, close the eyes and tap the teeth thirty-six times to awaken the body’s spirits. When finished, use the fingers to press the inner and outer corners of the eyes, massage the nose, rotate the ears left and right, and rub the face and eyes—this is the method for the true person’s daily rising. Additionally, one may perform *daoyin* exercises as the occasion demands to circulate the joints.\n\nThen, press the tongue against the upper palate, stirring the inner and outer fluids of the mouth. When the mouth is full, swallow the fluid, guiding it down into the stomach while visualizing the stomach spirit receiving it. Do this three times and stop. This is called \"rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid,\" which irrigates the five viscera and makes the face radiant. The general approach is largely the same.\n\nThen, let the spirit settle utterly, making the mind like withered wood and the body as empty as discarded clothing. Inwardly gaze and reverse the hearing, casting aside all thoughts. Only then may one begin the absorption.\n\nFor every step, keep the eyes closed and the hands clenched in *wo gu* (grasping the solid). Only when dispersing *qi* should the fingers be unfurled. The purpose of *wo gu* is to close the passes and guard against the intrusion of essence and evil. For beginners in *qi*-absorption, whose *qi*-pathways are not yet open, *wo gu* should not be used. Only after a hundred days or half a year, when the *qi* flows smoothly and sweat appears in the palms, may one adopt *wo gu*.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* says:\n*\"Close the three passes and grasp the solid to halt,\nRinse and swallow the golden liquor, ingest the jade blossoms.\nThus the three worms perish without need for food,\nAnd long practice naturally brings flourishing.\"*\n\n**Chapter Two: The Method of Dredging Qi**\n\nThe method states: Each of the five viscera possesses its own proper *qi*. When lying down at night, after closing the breath and awakening, one must first ensure that any undigested food is dissolved so that the *qi* may be expelled before beginning to regulate and absorb it.\n\nThe technique is as follows: Close the eyes and clench the hands in *wo gu*. Lie on the back, place the fists between the breasts, raise the knees, arch the back and buttocks, and hold the breath to drum the *qi* in the *qi*-sea, turning it from within outward. Exhale with a *he* sound, nine or eighteen times, and stop. This is called \"dredging the *qi*.\" When finished, regulate it.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Method of Regulating Qi**\n\nThe method states: The nose is the Gate of Heaven, and the mouth is the Door of Earth. Thus, the nose should be used for inhalation and the mouth for exhalation. One must not err in this, for error causes *qi* to rebel, and rebellious *qi* generates illness. Be especially cautious during exhalation and inhalation.\n\nDo not let the breath be audible to the ears. Regulate it five, seven, or nine times until it is harmonious. This is called \"regulating the *qi*.\" When finished, swallow it. At night, when sleeping, keep the mouth closed and do not exhale through it.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Method of Swallowing Qi**\n\nThe method states: The subtlety of absorbing inner *qi* lies in swallowing *qi*. Worldly people swallow external *qi*, mistaking it for inner *qi*, unable to distinguish between them—how could this not be mistaken? Practitioners of exhalation and inhalation must proceed with care to avoid error.\n\nAll people receive the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth to form their bodies, and within the body, the primordial *qi* naturally governs. Whenever one swallows or exhales and inhales, the inner *qi* responds to the outer *qi*. Naturally, the *qi* in the *qi*-sea rises with the exhalation, reaching the throat. Just as the exhalation reaches its limit, promptly close the mouth, drum the throat, and swallow, causing a gurgling sound. Then, for men, guide it down the left side; for women, the right, through the twenty-four joints, like flowing water, distinctly audible.\n\nThus, the inner *qi* and outer *qi* are clearly distinguished. With intention, guide it, and with the hand, rub it to hasten its descent into the *qi*-sea. The *qi*-sea is three *cun* below the navel, also called the lower *dantian*.\n\nFor beginners in *qi*-absorption, if the upper burner is not yet open, rubbing with the hand will hasten its descent. Once the flow is unimpeded, rubbing is unnecessary. After closing the mouth, perform three consecutive swallows and stop. Dry swallowing is called \"cloud movement.\" Swallowing with fluid, using the saliva in the mouth, is called \"rain bestowal.\"\n\nFor beginners whose *qi* has not yet circulated, each swallow should be followed by immediate circulation; one must not hastily proceed to three consecutive swallows. Only when the *qi* flows smoothly may one gradually increase the number, progressing toward minor attainment. After one year, the flow may become unimpeded; after three years of practice, one may absorb *qi* freely.\n\nFor those newly practicing *qi*-absorption whose pathways are not yet open, if a swallow does not descend, use a single swallow as a marker. Simply ensure that it descends with a gurgling sound, straight into the *qi*-sea.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Method of Circulating Qi**\n\nThe method states: The lower *dantian* is near two posterior cavities that connect to the spinal channel, ascending to the *niwan*. The *niwan* is the name for the palace of the brain.\n\nAfter every three consecutive swallows, swiftly visualize the lower *dantian* and guide the obtained inner primordial *qi* with intention into the two cavities. Then imagine two strands of white *qi* rising on either side of the spine, directly entering the *niwan*. The *qi* steams through all the palaces, pervading the hair, face, head, neck, arms, and fingers all at once, descending into the chest to the middle *dantian*. The middle *dantian* is the spirit of the heart palace.\n\nIt irrigates the five viscera, then returns to the lower *dantian*, reaching the three stars, traversing the knees, shins, and ankles, and descending to the *yongquan*. The *yongquan* is the center of the sole.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"governing with a single *qi*,\" drumming it like thunder and moistening it like wind and rain. Just as the earth has springs, without thunder to stir and drum them, they cannot nourish the myriad things. If one does not expel the turbid and foul *qi*, it will cause unease. Though one may have fluids suitable for rinsing and swallowing, and though they may irrigate the five viscera and bring forth radiance, they ultimately cannot return essence to replenish the brain.",

      "translated_text": "Without intercourse, one cannot guide it upward to swallow and internally refine it; without exhalation and inhalation, one cannot draw upon and employ it. Thus, the Dao of circulation and the principle of application are such that, emulating heaven and earth, one visualizes the turbid, foul, stagnant, and pathogenic *qi*, along with congealed blood within the body, being purged by the upright *qi* and expelled through the fingertips and toes—this is called \"dispersing *qi*.\" Then, extend the hands and fingers without clenching them. Each such cycle constitutes one passage; when the passages are unobstructed, illness is absent. One then readjusts, as if guiding the hands, though guiding the hands is again difficult. Drum and swallow as before, closing the *qi* and drumming it to swallow, reaching thirty-six breaths—this is called \"minor attainment.\"\n\nIf one has not yet ceased taking grains, one should eat sparingly at this stage, ensuring the abdomen remains empty and serene. Whether sitting or otherwise, whenever the abdomen is empty, swallow. From dawn to dusk, performing this ten times naturally yields three hundred and sixty swallows. If one has long practiced *qi* breathing and suddenly performs three hundred and sixty swallows, this is also called \"minor attainment.\" One thousand two hundred swallows are called \"major attainment,\" or \"great embryonic breathing.\" Simply closing the *qi* and counting to one thousand two hundred breaths is also \"major attainment,\" though the complexion will lack radiance.\n\nThere are also methods for refining *qi*, closing *qi*, yielding *qi*, and distributing *qi*, along with various essential techniques, all enumerated in the text. Those of like mind should study them carefully.\n\n**Method Six: Refining *Qi***\n\nThe method states: To refine the form by ingesting *qi*, enter a chamber when slightly at leisure. Remove clothing, let the hair down, lie supine, and extend the hands without clenching them. Comb the hair to ensure it flows freely onto the mat. Distribute the *qi*, then regulate and swallow it. After swallowing, close the *qi* and wait until it reaches its limit. Then, still the mind and extinguish thoughts, allowing the *qi* to flow freely and unobstructed. If oppressed, exhale; if panting, regulate the breath. Once the *qi* is calm, refine it again. Perform this ten times, then cease.\n\nFor those newly practicing *qi* ingestion who have not yet achieved free flow, begin with one cycle when at leisure, gradually increasing to ten. Once unobstructed, gradually increase to twenty or fifty, until the entire body sweats—this is the sign of efficacy. Calm the mind and harmonize the *qi*, avoiding exposure to drafts. This is the excellent defense for reversing aging and prolonging life. Perform this only when the fluids are clear and refreshed; if the *qi* is muddled or drowsiness arises, do not proceed. Practice diligently, and when the four limbs feel heavy or restless, perform this method—not necessarily daily, but whenever one feels clear and refreshed, whether every ten or five days.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* states: \"A thousand disasters vanish, a hundred illnesses heal; one need not fear the ferocity of tigers and wolves, and thus aging is reversed, and years prolonged.\"\n\n**Method Seven: Yielding *Qi***\n\nThe method states: The technique of yielding *qi* can be practiced when the body’s *qi* is harmonious, the spirit and body are regulated and smooth, and regardless of whether one is walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. Simply follow the gateways to regulate the *qi*. Whether reclining in a grove or sitting in stillness, free the mind of thoughts and awareness, sinking into profound tranquility, making the heart like the vast emptiness. Then regulate and close the *qi*, whether ten or twenty breaths, allowing the *qi* to flow freely without contention from the will. After a long while, the *qi* will exit through the pores of the skin, no longer exhaled through the mouth. Even if there is some residual, it is negligible. Regulate and repeat, striving to reach dozens of breaths—this is even better. It can be practiced while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. With diligent practice, the hundred passages open, the complexion becomes radiant, the spirit refreshed, and the *qi* clear, as if one has just bathed. Whenever there is disharmony, practice this method, and one will again feel at peace.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* states: \"Sitting upright in non-action, the hun and po are at peace; the spirit is clear, and I am truly one with it.\"\n\n**Method Eight: Closing *Qi***\n\nThe method states: If, due to improper cultivation, illness unexpectedly arises, swiftly retire to a secluded chamber and follow the *qi*-ingestion method. Arrange the hands and feet, then regulate and swallow the *qi*. Focus the mind on the afflicted area, close the *qi*, and direct it with intention to attack the ailment. When the *qi* reaches its limit, exhale, then swallow again in succession, continuing the attack as before. If the *qi* becomes strained, cease; when it is regulated, attack again. Perform this twenty to fifty times until the afflicted area sweats and feels unobstructed, then stop. If the ailment persists, practice this method at midnight, before dawn, or repeatedly during the day, directing the *qi* with intention. If the illness is in the head, face, hands, or feet, attack only the afflicted area—there is no ailment that will not be cured. Thus, the *qi* commanded by the mind is more effective than the hands, as if aided by spirits, its power beyond comprehension.\n\n**Method Nine: Distributing *Qi***\n\nThe method states: When intending to distribute *qi* to heal another’s illness, first determine the afflicted organ based on the patient’s symptoms, then draw *qi* from the corresponding direction and infuse it into the patient’s body. Have the patient face that direction, calm the mind, and purify the thoughts before distributing the *qi*. After distribution, instruct the patient to swallow the *qi*, and malevolent spirits will flee, while pathogenic *qi* will be permanently expelled.\n\n**Method Ten: The Six *Qi***\n\nThe method states: The six *qi* are *xu*, *he*, *si*, *chui*, *hu*, and *xi*. Five of the *qi* correspond to the five viscera, while the remaining one governs the triple burner.\n\n*Si* corresponds to the lungs, which govern the nose. For cold, heat, or disharmony in the nose, or extreme fatigue, practice *si* exhalation and inhalation to regulate the skin and treat sores and scabies. For such ailments, apply the method accordingly, and healing will be immediate.\n\n*He* corresponds to the heart, which governs the tongue. For dry mouth, rough tongue, or obstructed *qi*, as well as various pathogenic *qi*, use *he* to expel them. For great heat, open the mouth wide to *he*; for slight heat, open it slightly. Intentional focus is required for proper regulation.\n\n*Hu* corresponds to the spleen, which governs the central palace. For mild heat, disharmony, abdominal and stomach distension, or *qi* stagnation, use *hu* to regulate.\n\n*Chui* corresponds to the kidneys, which govern the ears. For coldness in the waist and abdomen or decline of yang vitality, use *chui* to regulate.\n\n*Xu* corresponds to the liver, which connects to the eyes. As the saying goes: \"When the liver is excessive, the eyes turn red.\"",

      "translated_text": "When illness arises, use *xu* to regulate it.\n\n*Xi* corresponds to the Triple Burner. For disharmony in the Triple Burner, use *xi* to regulate.\n\nThough each *qi* governs its respective domain, when the five viscera, Triple Burner, cold-heat, exhaustion, or unregulated wind pathogens are involved, all pertain to the heart. The heart governs *he*; using *he* to regulate all such illnesses will bring healing, and the six *qi* need not be employed.\n\n**Method for Harmonizing Fluids, Verse Ten**\nThe verse states: Humans consume the five flavors, each of which returns to its respective viscus. Every viscus generates turbid *qi*, which together emerge from the mouth. Moreover, the *qi* of the six breaths and Triple Burner all pass through this gate, converging with myriad impurities to form turbid *qi*.\n\nUpon waking from sleep, *qi* issues from the mouth, its odor unbearable. Examine and observe this to discern its signs. Whenever the mouth is parched, bitter, or the tongue rough; when the palate frequently lacks moisture or swallowing saliva causes throat pain and prevents eating—these are signs of extreme heat. Immediately open the mouth wide to *he*, ensuring each exhalation exits through the proper passage. After ten or twenty *he*, strike the Heavenly Drum seven or nine times, then gather the fluid from the Flower Pool beneath the tongue and swallow it. Repeat *he* and swallowing until the heat and fever subside. When sweet spring water flows in the mouth, the heat has retreated and the five viscera are cooled.\n\nIf the mouth’s fluids are cold and tasteless, or if excessive *he* leaves the heart unsettled, food and drink lose their savor, and water is rejected—these are signs of cold. Then use *chui* to warm it, following the method for warming cold. Wait until the mouth savors sweetness and the heart feels harmoniously warm before stopping.\n\nThe *Yellow Court Classic* states:\n*\"The Jade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root—*\n*Those who cultivate it with care may endure forever.\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"Rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid keeps calamity at bay.\"*\n\n**Method for Regulating Diet, Verse Twelve**\nThe verse states: After practicing *qi*-absorption, food must follow a proper sequence. Permissible foods are beneficial; forbidden foods are harmful. Harmful foods should be permanently avoided, while beneficial ones should be consistently consumed.\n\nEach morning at dawn, consume a small portion of plain watery congee or sesame congee, which greatly benefits the person, regulates spleen *qi*, and replenishes bodily fluids. At midday, plain wheat or barley cakes and steamed buns are excellent, provided they are not eaten while scalding hot, as this disrupts the proper *qi*. Onion dumpling soup is also beneficial. Rice should be made from non-glutinous rice or barley, which are nourishing.\n\nFor those practicing *qi*-absorption, these foods are suitable throughout the four seasons, though they need not be eaten daily. Follow one’s inclination at the time. If desired, dried venison is also beneficial. However, during purification fasts, it must not be consumed. On the thirty-six spirit days of the zodiac, when the corresponding animal signs are taboo, avoid eating them; dates, chestnuts, and steamed cakes may be eaten instead.\n\nOne may endure hunger but must never overeat, for satiety harms the heart and makes *qi* circulation especially difficult. Hot cakes, turnip soup, and the like are strictly forbidden! Strictly forbidden! Salty, sour, and pungent foods should be gradually reduced.\n\nAfter each meal, immediately *he* to expel the toxic turbid *qi* from the mouth, and no illness will arise. For those practicing *qi*-absorption, the intestines and stomach are empty and pure; raw, cold, sour, slippery, sticky, greasy, stale, hard, putrid, or indigestible foods must not be eaten. If such foods are accidentally consumed, the area where even a single bite lodges will surely ache slightly. Beware!\n\nOnly soft foods are appropriate. Before eating, first swallow three to five mouthfuls of *qi*, then consume the food, allowing the *qi* to take the lead. Additionally, swallowing three to five grains of raw Sichuan pepper is beneficial. After eating, swallow three more grains. This substance aids digestion, guides *qi* downward, unblocks the Triple Burner, benefits the five viscera, expels turbidity, dissolves stagnant food, and assists the upright *qi*. It is suitable for long-term use, as it dispels cold, summerheat, and dampness; brightens the eyes; promotes hair growth; and regulates *qi*. Its merits are too numerous to list in full—they are detailed in the *Great Clarity Classic*.\n\nThere is a separate method for consuming Sichuan pepper: when *qi* descends and causes diarrhea, expel it promptly. Beware of retention, for retention may lead to illness.\n\nWhen the stomach is empty, drinking one or two cups of clear wine as one pleases is highly beneficial. In winter, it warms; in summer, it cools. It assists the upright *qi* and dispels all pathogens—its merits are not insignificant. The danger lies in excess, for overindulgence leads to drunkenness, which harms the spirit and shortens life. If one encounters a situation of respect or necessity and cannot refuse, drink, but upon release, *he* three to five times. After drinking, open the mouth wide and *he* ten or more times to expel the toxins of fermentation and regulate the *qi*.\n\nOrdinarily, drinking one or two *sheng* slowly is not intoxicating, nor does it interfere with eating or diminish the flavor of food—it remains as before. Do not approach childbirth, death, or the six livestock, nor any filthy or unclean *qi*; even nearing them is inappropriate, let alone drawing close. This is most unsuitable for the upright *qi*.\n\nIf one unexpectedly encounters such impurities, quickly close the *qi*, face upwind, close the eyes, and pass swiftly. Then seek one or two cups of wine to cleanse the body. If one feels the *qi* has entered the abdomen and causes discomfort, immediately regulate the *qi* to expel the turbidity, then inhale fresh *qi* and direct it with the mind. Massage the area with the hand, then swallow Sichuan pepper and drink one or two cups of wine to disperse it. If it refuses to disperse, do not force regulation; let it exit naturally without distress. However, if the upper burner becomes congested, regulation is ultimately necessary to restore harmony.\n\nFoods that are greasy, oily, or pungent severely offend the upright *qi*—be vigilant in avoiding them. One should recognize past transgressions and refrain from repeating them.\n\nThus, after practicing *qi*-absorption for one year, *qi* flows smoothly; after two years, the blood is replete; after three years, the achievement is complete. The primordial *qi* becomes dense and substantial, and even if one encounters transgressions, they cannot cause harm. Swallowing a thousand mouthfuls of *qi* daily is not excessive. Rejuvenation and the return to youth gradually begin from this.\n\n*Qi* transforms into fluids, fluids into blood, blood into essence, essence into marrow, and marrow into sinews.",

      "translated_text": "**Method Fifteen: The Art of Qi Ingestion and Embryonic Breathing**\n\nThe method states: Most people in the world indulge in desires, harming life and cutting short their destiny—this has been true from ancient times to the present. If one does not take early precautions, how can regret avail anything later? When a person nears death, they begin to cherish their body and life; once guilt is certain, they think to seek good deeds; when illness has already taken hold, they seek medicine. Yet the net of heaven has already been cast—how can it be saved? Thus, the wise and sagacious, valuing their life before its end, guard against misfortune before it arises, and treat illness before it takes root. They cast off worldly robes, gather their minds, and return to the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is *qi*; *qi* is the master of the heart; the master is essence; essence is the root of life. Cherish essence and value *qi*, and only then will life be truly valued—this is the path to balance. As the *Huangting Jing* states:\n*\"Guard closely within the square inch of your heart,\nAnd spirit and vitality will return, restoring youth and strength.\nNurture the jade-tree child as if it were your staff,\nHasten to secure your essence and repay yourself.\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"For long life, be most cautious in the chamber—\nWhy cause your spirit to weep in death?\nIf the sea of essence is drained and a hundred streams pour out,\nThe leaves fall, the tree withers, and verdant youth is lost.\"*\n\nThose who attain long life and enduring vision do so only by cherishing essence and preserving *qi*. The way of the inner elixir and the art of inner cultivation are unknown to the world. Even those who diligently cultivate *qi* but do not sever desire will not escape calamity. Thus it is said: Man loses the Dao—the Dao does not lose man; man does not know life—life does not abandon man. The cultivated gentleman preserves and reflects upon himself.\n\n**The Art of Qi Ingestion and Embryonic Breathing**\nThe method states: Essence is *qi*; *qi* is the Dao. First, knock the teeth together thirty-six times, then turn the head to the right in a full circle, stretching the neck like a turtle. With embryonic breathing, when *qi* rises to the throat, swallow it. Do this three times, then close the mouth. Rub the tongue inside and outside the mouth, gathering saliva, rinsing it until the mouth is full, then tilt the head back and swallow. This nourishes the *Niwan* (the upper elixir field, located at the crown of the head) and moistens the five viscera. Laozi said: *\"Sweet rain nourishes the myriad things; embryonic fluid moistens the five viscera.\"* If one does this day and night without ceasing, one becomes a true person, attaining immortality above and longevity below. For any illness or suffering in the body, visualize *qi* being sent to the afflicted area, and it will be cured. True *qi* expels turbid *qi*, surging upward and purging downward. When the spirit feels clear and refreshed, *qi* naturally harmonizes.\n\nThus the sages have said: Man exists within *qi*, and *qi* exists within man; man does not depart from *qi*, nor *qi* from man. Man relies on *qi* to live and loses *qi* in death. The principle of life and death lies entirely in *qi*. If one can master the art of *qi*, even death cannot claim them. Therefore, at midnight and the fifth watch, stretch out both legs, clench the fists, and extend the hands five inches from the body. The pillow should not exceed two inches in height. Close the eyes and swallow as before. After washing and grooming, warm a cup of wine and drink it to enhance embryonic breathing, moisten the six bowels, guide *qi*, and seal the hundred meridians. This is the secret method of the immortals of Mount Emei—ineffable and profound.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Spiritual mushrooms and jade blossoms reside within the belly. Seeking medicines in famous mountains and great marshes strays far from the Dao. My Way is exceedingly simple—if one can but practice it: Upon rising early, stretch out both legs, regulate the breath, clasp the hands behind the head, pull forward with the hands while pulling backward with the head, and pause. Do this three times. Then interlock the fingers, pull forward three or two times, and tug left and right three or two times. Finally, swallow saliva twenty times. If the four limbs feel unbalanced, rinse the mouth with saliva thirty or twenty times and swallow, and the *qi* will flow smoothly, curing illness swiftly. This method is priceless and must not be lightly transmitted. If imparted to the unworthy, calamity will extend to three generations.\"*\n\nHere ends the method of Master Youzhen on ingesting the inner primordial *qi*.",
