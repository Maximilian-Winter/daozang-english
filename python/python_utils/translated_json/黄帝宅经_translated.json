  "full_translation": "**Huangdi’s Residence Classic**\n*Title:* Huangdi’s Residence Classic\n*Author:* Unknown\n*Source:* *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dongzhen* (Verdant Purity) Section, *Zhongshu* (Miscellaneous Arts) Category\n\n**Huangdi’s Residence Classic, Upper Scroll**\n\nThe residence is indeed the pivotal hinge of yin and yang, the model for human order. Without profound knowledge and sagely insight, none can grasp this Dao.\n\nOf the five essentials, the most critical and truly secret art is the method of residence.\n\nWherever a person dwells, they reside in a home—whether grand or humble, the interplay of yin and yang differs. Even within a single rented chamber, there exists good and ill fortune. The great principles apply to the grand, the minor to the small. Those who transgress invite calamity, while proper alignment halts disaster—just as medicine cures illness.\n\nThus, the residence is the foundation of a person.\nA person takes the residence as their home. If it is harmonious, their lineage prospers with good fortune; if unstable, their clan declines, their graves become desolate by rivers and hills.\n\nAll follow this principle: from armies and nations above, to prefectures, counties, and villages below, even to mountain dwellings—wherever people reside, the same rules apply.\n\nWhat we see and hear confirms that ancient systems were not few in number.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor’s *Er Zhai Jing* (Two-Dwellings Classic), the *Di Dian Zhai Jing* (Earth Canon Dwellings Classic), the *San Yuan Zhai Jing* (Three Elements Dwellings Classic), the *Wen Wang Zhai Jing* (King Wen’s Dwellings Classic), the *Kong Zi Zhai Jing* (Confucius’ Dwellings Classic), the *Zhai Jin, Zhai Nao, Zhai Tong, Zhai Jing, Tian Lao Zhai Jing* (Residence Patterns, Residence Lures, Residence Regulations, Residence Mirror, Heavenly Old Man’s Dwellings Classic), the *Liu Gen Zhai Jing* (Liu’s Root Dwellings Classic), the *Xuan Nü Zhai Jing* (Mysterious Lady’s Dwellings Classic), the *Si Ma Tian Shi Zhai Jing* (Master Si Ma’s Dwellings Classic), the *Huai Nan Zi Zhai Jing* (Master Huai Nan’s Dwellings Classic), the *Wang Wei Zhai Jing* (Wang Wei’s Dwellings Classic), the *Si Zui Zhai Jing* (Si Zui’s Dwellings Classic), the *Liu Jin Ping Zhai Jing* (Liu Jin Ping’s Dwellings Classic), the *Zhang Zi Bo Zhai Jing* (Zhang Zi Bo’s Dwellings Classic), the *Ba Gua Zhai Jing* (Eight Trigrams Dwellings Classic), the *Wu Zhao Zhai Jing* (Five Omens Dwellings Classic), the *Xuan Wu Zhai Jing* (Mysterious Understanding Dwellings Classic), the *Liu Shi Si Gua Zhai Jing* (Sixty-Four Hexagrams Dwellings Classic), the *You Pan Long Zhai Jing* (Right-Sided Dragon Dwellings Classic), the *Li Chun Feng Zhai Jing* (Li Chun Feng’s Dwellings Classic), the *Wu Xing Zhai Jing* (Five Clans Dwellings Classic), the *Lü Cai Zhai Jing* (Lü Cai’s Dwellings Classic), the *Fei Yin Luan Fu Zhai Jing* (Flying Yin, Tumbling Fu Dwellings Classic), and the *Zi Xia Jin Men Zhai Jing* (Zi Xia’s Golden Gate Dwellings Classic)—all the aforementioned classics, though differing in minor details, share a common essence. Each claims its own hidden wonders, yet they mutually praise and criticize one another. Without exhaustive inquiry, one cannot apply them fully.\n\nIn recent times, scholars often focus on *Wu Xing Ba Zhai* (Five Clans Eight Dwellings) and *Huang Dao Bai Fang* (Yellow Dao/Way White Directions), yet their methods invariably violate the core principles of the great classics, leading to misfortune and calamity. How tragic it is that people transgress the Dao/Way’s harmony, causing their dwellings to be abandoned and their alignment with yin and yang to yield no results!\n\nTo honor the sages of old and make their teachings resplendent, I now reveal to the unenlightened the daily applications they overlooked. The sun and moon, the heavens and earth, the cold and heat, the masculine and feminine—day and night, yin and yang—all these encompass the myriad phenomena, embodying the thousand threads of existence. In their boundless transformations, they shape the world profoundly.\n\nThe principle of yin and yang is this: the yin of the classics is the mother that generates and transforms all things; the yang is the father that does the same. They are the progenitors of heaven and earth, the revered ones of nurturance. To follow them brings prosperity; to defy them brings ruin—what difference is there? The loyal official receives his due, while the one who betrays his mandate suffers misfortune. Such is the law.\n\nNow, I compile verified secrets and arrange them into the Twenty-Four Paths, the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, aligning with the positions of female and male, demarcating the boundaries of yin and yang in the residence. By examining auspicious and inauspicious signs, none surpass the first Two-Dwellings Classic—this is indeed the sacred method of nourishing life’s essence!\n\nThe Twenty-Four Paths correspond to the main and side halls of a residence, dividing the four directions into twenty-four paths: the Ten Heavenly Stems, the Twelve Earthly Branches, and the trigrams *Qian* (Heaven), *Gen* (Mountain), *Kun* (Earth), and *Xun* (Wind), together forming these Twenty-Four Paths.\n\n*Qian* governs the Three Males: *Zhen* (Thunder), *Kan* (Water), and *Gen* (Mountain), all belonging to the yang position. Thus, from the northwest, *Qian*’s *Zhen* is the yang’s brilliance.\n\n*Kun* governs the Three Females: *Xun* (Wind), *Li* (Fire), and *Dui* (Lake), all belonging to the yin position. Thus, from the southeast, *Xun*’s path, following its sequence to *Xu* (Earth), is the yin’s brilliance.\n\nHence, yang does not stand alone; it gains strength from yin. A residence should be modified to suit the yin’s Way. Yin does not stand alone; it gains strength from yang. As stated above.\n\nIt is also like the virtue of winter being warmth and summer being coolness, the male being strengthened by the female, and the female by the male.\n\n*The Easy Key* states: *\"Yin obtains yang like summer obtains coolness; when the Five Stems harmonize, all affairs flourish.\"*\n\nThus, a residence with a **virtue/power** (德) that is lofty, vigorous, and dense is auspicious, while excessive yin or excessive yang is inauspicious.\n\nA **yang residence** should enhance the **east** and **north** directions, while the **south** is considered excessive. The **east** is the **Chen-South** position, and the **west** is the **Xu-North** position, with a diagonal division marking the boundary between yin and yang.\n\nFor a **yang residence**, there is yang *qi* embracing yin, and for a **yin residence**, there is yin *qi* embracing yang. Such yin-yang residences are the **Dragon** (龙).\n\nIn a **yang residence**, the Dragon’s head is in *Hai* (Water), and its tail is in *Si* (Fire). In a **yin residence**, the Dragon’s head is in *Si* (Fire), and its tail is in *Hai* (Water).\n\nThe appearance of the Dragon is as follows: the **yin Dragon** is green, the **yang Dragon** is red; each has its own command-sitting position—**avoid violating** (犯) these at all costs.\n\nIf one moves from *Xun* (Wind) toward *Qian* (Heaven), from *Wu* (Horse) toward *Zi* (Water), from *Kun* (Earth) toward *Gen* (Mountain), from *You* (Rooster) toward *Mao* (Wood), or from *Xu* (Earth) toward *Chen* (Metal), these are called **yang shifts** (入阳). If such shifts occur near the residence of the **upper official** (上官), regardless of distance, they are all considered **yang shifts**.\n\nIf one moves from *Qian* (Heaven) toward *Xun* (Wind), from *Zi* (Water) toward *Wu* (Horse), from *Gen* (Mountain) toward *Kun* (Earth), from *Mao* (Wood) toward *You* (Rooster), or from *Chen* (Metal) toward *Xu* (Earth), these are called **yin shifts** (入阴). If such shifts occur near the upper official’s residence, they are all considered **yin shifts**.\n\nThus, the directions of **virtue/power** (福德) must diligently follow the **Dao/Way** of Heaven. When **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德), **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德), and **life-giving *qi*** (生气) arrive at that position, one should then modify the residence to be **clean, spacious, and sturdy**—this will bring the entire household **peace and prosperity, along with wealth and honor**. Heaven’s **virtue/power** (福德) is the **residence’s financial destiny** (财命).\n\nIf the **financial destiny** is **virtue/power**-ful, why should one fear not flourishing? Hence, one must diligently modify it.\n\nIf yin and yang are **repeatedly shifted** (重往), it is called **no *qi*** (无气). If yin and yang are **three times repeatedly shifted** (三度重入), it is called **no soul** (无魂). If **four times shifted** (四入), it is called **no spirit** (无魄). When the soul and spirit are lost, the household will collapse, its members will flee, and descendants will perish—this is the **extinction of the clan and the severing of posterity** (灭门绝嗣).\n\n*The Classic* says: *\"If violations continue, the clan will perish, and posterity will be severed—this is what is meant.\"*\n\nIf one maintains a single yin-yang shift, the back-and-forth will align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, naturally forming an auspicious pattern.\n\nIf one must repeatedly shift, then one should stay in each direction for **forty-five days, seventy-five days, or until the shifts cease without harm** (无咎), but it is still better to modify the residence to suit the **life-giving *qi* and virtue/power** directions for auspiciousness.\n\nIf one violates the **Five Ghosts** (五鬼), **severing of life** (绝命), or **punitive *qi*** (刑祸), the harm is even greater.\n\n*The Key* states: *\"If movement is not measured, it is better to return to the original state.\"* This is what is meant.\n\nIt also says: *\"If the residence is impoverished, urgently reverse the original courtyard.\"* One should **demolish structures in the punitive *qi* direction** (刑祸方舍) and **expand those in the virtue/power direction** (福德方).\n\nIt also says: *\"Reverse the residence, flatten the walls—this can dispel calamity.\"* If a residence’s annual *qi* is inauspicious, or if there are quarrels, illnesses, or other misfortunes, one should **narrow the punitive *qi* direction and expand the virtue/power direction**, adjusting the walls accordingly—this will **dissipate the disaster and bring great auspiciousness**.\n\nThose who discern a residence’s **Dao/Way** must consider the **shifted directions** (移来方位), not merely whether it faces **north of the street** (街北) or **south of the street** (街南). Even if a position is **yang**, one should not hesitate to reside there as a **yin residence**—this is auspicious. The **south** and **west** of the street are **yin**—even if one resides there as a **yang residence**, it is still auspicious.\n\nWhen shifting directions, one should not restrict the distance—**whether one *li*, one hundred *li*, one thousand *li*, ten steps, or a hundred steps**, all are treated equally.\n\nFor these two types of residences, modifications and constructions must be based solely on Heaven’s **Dao/Way**. When **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德), **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德), and **life-giving *qi*** (生气) arrive, one must modify accordingly—**without avoiding** the **General’s *qi*** (将军), **Grandfather’s *qi*** (太岁), **Tiger’s Tail** (豹尾), **Yellow Banner** (黄幡), **Black Banner** (黑方), or **harmonious names** (音姓).\n\nWhat is auspicious or inauspicious must follow the yin-yang *qi* as primary, for these gods’ **punitive *qi*** (神杀), the **Five Stems**, and the **Sixty Heavenly Stems-Earthly Branches** (六十甲子) all arise from these two *qi* and are positioned in the cardinal directions, influencing **public affairs** for a year. Hence, they are not considered disasters.\n\nIf any **punitive *qi*** (刑杀) is in the **punitive *qi* direction** (刑祸方), even if **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德) and **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德) arrive, one must still avoid it. If the **punitive *qi*** is within the residence itself, the **virtue/power direction** (福德方) should wait until **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德), **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德), and **life-giving *qi*** (生气) arrive at that position before modifying it—**the more effort exerted, the better the result**, hence it should not be avoided.\n\nIf one does not understand that yin-yang *qi* must be modified when it arrives at a position—**the more effort exerted, the better the result**, hence it should not be avoided—one cannot grasp its overarching principles.\n\nIt also says: *\"If the punitive *qi* direction is incomplete, restore it and connect with the **virtue/power direction** (福德方)—this brings long-term auspiciousness.\"*\n\nIt also says: *\"The punitive *qi* direction’s walls and structures should be **narrow and thin**, guarding against their being **lofty and vigorous**.\"* The **virtue/power direction** (福德方) and its walls and structures should be **connected and sturdy** for the household.\n\nIt also says: *\"If the punitive *qi* direction is **constricted and repeatedly constricted**, calamities and disasters will still fearlessly pursue. If the virtue/power direction is **expanded and repeatedly expanded**, descendants will enjoy prosperity and joy. The punitive *qi* direction must be **guarded against encroachment and expansion**; if too constricted, the *qi* will be insufficient, and insufficient *qi* will diminish wealth and fortune. The virtue/power direction must also be **guarded against excessive encroachment and expansion**; if too extreme, the **virtue/power** and **punitive *qi*** will become negligible, failing to **dissipate the thick auspicious *qi*** that descends upon it.\"*\n\nIf **any direction is excessive or encroached upon beyond its original proportion**, it is called **excessive**.\n\nIt also says: *\"A residence has **Five Emptinesses** (五虚), which bring poverty and depletion; and **Five Fullnesses** (五实), which bring wealth and nobility.\nThe **Five Emptinesses**:\n1. A large residence with few people (**大人少**).\n2. A large residence with a small gate (**宅门大内小**).\n3. Incomplete walls and courtyards (**墙院不完**).\n4. A well or water source without proper positioning (**井鳌不处**).\n5. A residence with **excessive land and insufficient houses, or overly spacious courtyards** (宅地多、屋少、庭院广).\n\nThe **Five Fullnesses**:\n1. A small residence with many people (**宅小人多**).\n2. A large residence with a small gate (**宅大门小**).\n3. Complete walls and courtyards (**墙院完全**).\n4. A small residence with many livestock (**宅小六畜多**).\n5. Water channels that **flow northward** (水沟束南流).\n\nIt also says: *\"If a residence gradually flourishes, do not abandon the courtyard. If it does not decline, do not move—otherwise, calamity will follow. If one seeks a broader dwelling, it is not necessarily joyful; if one builds only half, one will certainly attain longevity.\"* A residence should not be overly broad.\n\nIt also says: *\"Though its fields may be fertile, weeding and tilling will make them flourish; though its residence may be good, modifying and moving will make it prosperous.\"*\n\n「The **residence (宅)** and **tomb (墓)** together symbolize the source of honor and prosperity. Those who gain advantage will act according to their desires, while those who lose advantage will recklessly construct contrary to their true nature.\n\nWhen the tomb is **auspicious (凶)** and the residence is **auspicious (吉)**, descendants attain **official rank and wealth (官禄)**.\nWhen the tomb is **auspicious (吉)** but the residence is **auspicious (凶)**, descendants suffer from insufficient clothing and food.\nWhen both the tomb and residence are **auspicious (吉)**, descendants flourish in honor and prosperity.\nWhen both the tomb and residence are **auspicious (凶)**, descendants are forced to relocate, their lineage perishes, ancestral spirits **condemn (谴责)** them, and **land calamities (地祸)** persist. Over seven generations, their souls endure sorrow and suffering, descendants fail to thrive, scatter as refugees, wander like tumbleweed, and die as strangers along riversides.\n\n**Qingwu Zi (青乌子)** said: If the residence **aligns with (得)** the tomb, the two **spirits (神)** gradually **protect (护)** the descendants, securing their **wealth and position (禄位)**.\nIf the residence **aligns with (得)** the land and the tomb, the **Dragon’s brewing (龙酿)** and **Tiger’s strides (虎步)** bring prosperity—**livestock and crops flourish (物业滋川)**, wealth accumulates in granaries—descendants uphold **loyalty and filial piety (忠孝)**, and celestial spirits **assist (佑助)** them.\n\n**Zi Xia (子夏)** said: Tombs have **Four Anomalies (四奇)**—the **commercial (商)** and **angular (角)** alignments **afflict (二姓)** two clans, while **homophonic (丙壬)** and **sinister (乙辛)** strike three. The **celestial (甲)** and **earthly (庚)** as well as **metal (丁)** and **water (癸)** are also **auspicious (奇)**.\nIf the residence **aligns with (得)** the land and the **celestial alignment (宫)**, descendants become **governors and nobles (刺史王公)**, adorned in **scarlet robes and purple sashes (朱衣紫绶)**, their lineage **renowned and powerful (名雄)**.\nIf the residence **aligns with (得)** the land but **loses (失)** the celestial alignment, there is **prosperity without permanence (有始无终)**—ancestors suffer, and descendants face misfortune.\nIf the residence **loses (失)** the land but **aligns with (得)** the celestial alignment, descendants will never lack, though they may lack **foundations of wealth (基业)**, their **clothing and food (衣食)** will still be abundant.\nIf the residence **loses (失)** both the land and celestial alignment, their lineage **perishes utterly (绝嗣无踪)**, descendants **beg for sustenance (行求衣食)** and die as strangers in **reeds and thistles (蒿蓬)**.\n\n**Zi Xia (子夏)** also said: A person **establishes (立)** themselves through their residence, and a residence **endures (存)** through its inhabitants. Human and residence **mutually support (相扶)**, harmonizing with the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth (天地)**. Thus, one must not **blindly trust (独信)** fate alone.\n\n**The Sequence of Residence Construction (修宅次第法):**\nFirst **rectify (修)** the **auspicious (刑祸)**, then **cultivate (修)** **virtue/power (福德)**, and it will be auspicious.\nFirst **cultivate (修)** **virtue/power (福德)**, then **rectify (修)** the auspicious, and it will be inauspicious.\nFor **tombs (阴宅)**, construction begins from the **fourth heavenly stem (巳)** and follows the **auspicious (吉)** sequence of the **Eight Trigrams (八卦)**. For **residences (阳宅)**, it begins from the **eleventh heavenly stem (亥)** and follows the same.\n\nWhen **auspicious (刑祸)** matters are **rectified (方)**, employ **one hundred laborers (一百工)**. When **virtue/power (福德)** is **cultivated (方)**, use **two hundred laborers (二百工)** to **overwhelm (压)** the former—this ensures auspiciousness.\n**Residences (阳宅)** should be **rectified (修)** mostly in **external (外)** aspects, while **tombs (阴宅)** focus on **internal (内)** rectifications.\n\nSome mistakenly **divide (取)** **residence (子)** and **tomb (午)**, separating **yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)**—this is a grave error.\nThis is the **Dao/Way of the Two Qi (二气)**—**yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)**—**potentially harmonizing (潜通)**, yet their **cyclical returns (运回)** differ. The **Eight Trigrams (八卦)** and **Nine Palaces (九宫)** display **forms and symbols (形象)**, aligning with **male and female positions (男女之位)**.\n\nAt the **winter solstice (冬至)**, the **sacred (圣)** reaches the **fourth heavenly stem (巳)** to the **eleventh heavenly stem (亥)**—this marks the **extreme divergence (极处)** of **yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)** in their **ascendancy (起盛)**. The **sage (圣人)** mapped the **Eight Trigrams (八卦)** upon the earth, arranging the **palaces of males and females (女男之宫)**. The **palaces (宫)** are the **residences (宅)**.\n**Xun (巽)** represents the **eldest daughter (长女)**, belonging to **yin (阴)**; **Qian (乾)** symbolizes **Heaven (天)**, which is **yang (阳)** and **illuminating (明)**.\n\nIf one possesses **great talent (长才)**, **profound wisdom (深智)**, **compassion for all (慜物)**, **love for life (爱生)**, and **respect for the enlightened (敬晓)**, their **door (斯门)** will bring **unfathomable benefits (利莫测)**.\nMajor **transgressions (犯)** lead to **family ruin and dispersal (家破逃散)**; minor **transgressions (犯)** result in **loss of rank and office (失爵亡官)**.\nOther **miscellaneous transgressions (杂犯)**—such as **fires (火光)**, **verbal disputes (口舌)**, **lame limbs (跛蹇)**, **partial paralysis (偏枯)**, **decline and calamity (衰殃)**, **illness (疾病)**—all manifest in countless ways. How can such matters be **dismissed lightly (轻之)**?\n\nIf the **transgression (犯处)** is **distant (远)** and **neglected (慢)**, its effects will appear only after **half a year, one year, two years, or three years**.\nIf the **transgression (犯处)** is **near (近)** and **urgent (紧)**, its effects will manifest within **seventy-five days, forty-five days, or even before the month ends**.\n\nIf one encounters this **diagram (图)**, they will naturally **comprehend (悟会)** its principles. Whether **wise or foolish (愚智)**, if they **cultivate virtue/power (福德自修)** and **avoid transgressions (灾殃不犯)**, they will attain **official prosperity (官荣)** and **wealthy sustenance (进达)**. Livestock will **thrive in peace (获安)**, and such benefits **outshine even Heaven’s offerings (天寿金玉之献)**.\n\nThis **diagram (图)** should be **kept as a family treasure (家藏)**, sincerely passed down to descendants, **hidden and revered (秘而宝之)**, and named the **\"Residence Mirror (宅镜)\"**.\n\nThe **Residence Book (宅书)** also states:\nTo **demolish (拆)** the old and **build anew (营新)**, if the **divinatory lines (爻卜)** **contradict (相伏)**, moving from **south (南)** to **north (北)**—where **yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)** **intersect harmoniously (交分)**—is **auspicious (和)**.\n**Yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)** are **qi (气)**, ever-changing with those who dwell within; **auspiciousness (吉)** and **inauspiciousness (凶)** are **transformations (化)**, arising with circumstances.\nThe **endless cycles of Heaven and Earth (坎天地运转)** and the **variations of humans, livestock, and spirits (人畜鬼神变化)** are **unpredictable (何准)**. The *Search for the Supernatural (搜神记)* says: **Refined spirits (精灵)** and **ghostly apparitions (鬼魅)** can all **transform into humans (化为人)**.\nSome may **mutually influence (自相感)** and **become demonic (变为祆怪)**, akin to **heterogeneous wood (异性之木)**—when joined, it grows.

Each claims its own hidden wonders, yet they mutually praise and criticize one another. Without exhaustive inquiry, one cannot apply them fully.\n\nIn recent times, scholars often focus on *Wu Xing Ba Zhai* (Five Clans Eight Dwellings) and *Huang Dao Bai Fang* (Yellow Dao/Way White Directions), yet their methods invariably violate the core principles of the great classics, leading to misfortune and calamity. How tragic it is that people transgress the Dao/Way’s harmony, causing their dwellings to be abandoned and their alignment with yin and yang to yield no results!\n\nTo honor the sages of old and make their teachings resplendent, I now reveal to the unenlightened the daily applications they overlooked. The sun and moon, the heavens and earth, the cold and heat, the masculine and feminine—day and night, yin and yang—all these encompass the myriad phenomena, embodying the thousand threads of existence. In their boundless transformations, they shape the world profoundly.\n\nThe principle of yin and yang is this: the yin of the classics is the mother that generates and transforms all things; the yang is the father that does the same. They are the progenitors of heaven and earth, the revered ones of nurturance. To follow them brings prosperity; to defy them brings ruin—what difference is there? The loyal official receives his due, while the one who betrays his mandate suffers misfortune. Such is the law.\n\nNow, I compile verified secrets and arrange them into the Twenty-Four Paths, the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, aligning with the positions of female and male, demarcating the boundaries of yin and yang in the residence. By examining auspicious and inauspicious signs, none surpass the first Two-Dwellings Classic—this is indeed the sacred method of nourishing life’s essence!\n\nThe Twenty-Four Paths correspond to the main and side halls of a residence, dividing the four directions into twenty-four paths: the Ten Heavenly Stems, the Twelve Earthly Branches, and the trigrams *Qian* (Heaven), *Gen* (Mountain), *Kun* (Earth), and *Xun* (Wind), together forming these Twenty-Four Paths.\n\n*Qian* governs the Three Males: *Zhen* (Thunder), *Kan* (Water), and *Gen* (Mountain), all belonging to the yang position. Thus, from the northwest, *Qian*’s *Zhen* is the yang’s brilliance.\n\n*Kun* governs the Three Females: *Xun* (Wind), *Li* (Fire), and *Dui* (Lake), all belonging to the yin position. Thus, from the southeast, *Xun*’s path, following its sequence to *Xu* (Earth), is the yin’s brilliance.\n\nHence, yang does not stand alone; it gains strength from yin. A residence should be modified to suit the yin’s Way. Yin does not stand alone; it gains strength from yang. As stated above.",

      "translated_text": "It is also like the virtue of winter being warmth and summer being coolness, the male being strengthened by the female, and the female by the male.\n\n*The Easy Key* states: *\"Yin obtains yang like summer obtains coolness; when the Five Stems harmonize, all affairs flourish.\"*\n\nThus, a residence with a **virtue/power** (德) that is lofty, vigorous, and dense is auspicious, while excessive yin or excessive yang is inauspicious.\n\nA **yang residence** should enhance the **east** and **north** directions, while the **south** is considered excessive. The **east** is the **Chen-South** position, and the **west** is the **Xu-North** position, with a diagonal division marking the boundary between yin and yang.\n\nFor a **yang residence**, there is yang *qi* embracing yin, and for a **yin residence**, there is yin *qi* embracing yang. Such yin-yang residences are the **Dragon** (龙).\n\nIn a **yang residence**, the Dragon’s head is in *Hai* (Water), and its tail is in *Si* (Fire). In a **yin residence**, the Dragon’s head is in *Si* (Fire), and its tail is in *Hai* (Water).\n\nThe appearance of the Dragon is as follows: the **yin Dragon** is green, the **yang Dragon** is red; each has its own command-sitting position—**avoid violating** (犯) these at all costs.\n\nIf one moves from *Xun* (Wind) toward *Qian* (Heaven), from *Wu* (Horse) toward *Zi* (Water), from *Kun* (Earth) toward *Gen* (Mountain), from *You* (Rooster) toward *Mao* (Wood), or from *Xu* (Earth) toward *Chen* (Metal), these are called **yang shifts** (入阳). If such shifts occur near the residence of the **upper official** (上官), regardless of distance, they are all considered **yang shifts**.\n\nIf one moves from *Qian* (Heaven) toward *Xun* (Wind), from *Zi* (Water) toward *Wu* (Horse), from *Gen* (Mountain) toward *Kun* (Earth), from *Mao* (Wood) toward *You* (Rooster), or from *Chen* (Metal) toward *Xu* (Earth), these are called **yin shifts** (入阴). If such shifts occur near the upper official’s residence, they are all considered **yin shifts**.\n\nThus, the directions of **virtue/power** (福德) must diligently follow the **Dao/Way** of Heaven. When **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德), **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德), and **life-giving *qi*** (生气) arrive at that position, one should then modify the residence to be **clean, spacious, and sturdy**—this will bring the entire household **peace and prosperity, along with wealth and honor**. Heaven’s **virtue/power** (福德) is the **residence’s financial destiny** (财命).\n\nIf the **financial destiny** is **virtue/power**-ful, why should one fear not flourishing? Hence, one must diligently modify it.\n\nIf yin and yang are **repeatedly shifted** (重往), it is called **no *qi*** (无气). If yin and yang are **three times repeatedly shifted** (三度重入), it is called **no soul** (无魂). If **four times shifted** (四入), it is called **no spirit** (无魄). When the soul and spirit are lost, the household will collapse, its members will flee, and descendants will perish—this is the **extinction of the clan and the severing of posterity** (灭门绝嗣).\n\n*The Classic* says: *\"If violations continue, the clan will perish, and posterity will be severed—this is what is meant.\"*\n\nIf one maintains a single yin-yang shift, the back-and-forth will align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, naturally forming an auspicious pattern.\n\nIf one must repeatedly shift, then one should stay in each direction for **forty-five days, seventy-five days, or until the shifts cease without harm** (无咎), but it is still better to modify the residence to suit the **life-giving *qi* and virtue/power** directions for auspiciousness.\n\nIf one violates the **Five Ghosts** (五鬼), **severing of life** (绝命), or **punitive *qi*** (刑祸), the harm is even greater.\n\n*The Key* states: *\"If movement is not measured, it is better to return to the original state.\"* This is what is meant.\n\nIt also says: *\"If the residence is impoverished, urgently reverse the original courtyard.\"* One should **demolish structures in the punitive *qi* direction** (刑祸方舍) and **expand those in the virtue/power direction** (福德方).\n\nIt also says: *\"Reverse the residence, flatten the walls—this can dispel calamity.\"* If a residence’s annual *qi* is inauspicious, or if there are quarrels, illnesses, or other misfortunes, one should **narrow the punitive *qi* direction and expand the virtue/power direction**, adjusting the walls accordingly—this will **dissipate the disaster and bring great auspiciousness**.\n\nThose who discern a residence’s **Dao/Way** must consider the **shifted directions** (移来方位), not merely whether it faces **north of the street** (街北) or **south of the street** (街南). Even if a position is **yang**, one should not hesitate to reside there as a **yin residence**—this is auspicious. The **south** and **west** of the street are **yin**—even if one resides there as a **yang residence**, it is still auspicious.\n\nWhen shifting directions, one should not restrict the distance—**whether one *li*, one hundred *li*, one thousand *li*, ten steps, or a hundred steps**, all are treated equally.\n\nFor these two types of residences, modifications and constructions must be based solely on Heaven’s **Dao/Way**. When **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德), **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德), and **life-giving *qi*** (生气) arrive, one must modify accordingly—**without avoiding** the **General’s *qi*** (将军), **Grandfather’s *qi*** (太岁), **Tiger’s Tail** (豹尾), **Yellow Banner** (黄幡), **Black Banner** (黑方), or **harmonious names** (音姓).\n\nWhat is auspicious or inauspicious must follow the yin-yang *qi* as primary, for these gods’ **punitive *qi*** (神杀), the **Five Stems**, and the **Sixty Heavenly Stems-Earthly Branches** (六十甲子) all arise from these two *qi* and are positioned in the cardinal directions, influencing **public affairs** for a year. Hence, they are not considered disasters.\n\nIf any **punitive *qi*** (刑杀) is in the **punitive *qi* direction** (刑祸方), even if **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德) and **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德) arrive, one must still avoid it. If the **punitive *qi*** is within the residence itself, the **virtue/power direction** (福德方) should wait until **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德), **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德), and **life-giving *qi*** (生气) arrive at that position before modifying it—**the more effort exerted, the better the result**, hence it should not be avoided.\n\nIf one does not understand that yin-yang *qi* must be modified when it arrives at a position—**the more effort exerted, the better the result**, hence it should not be avoided—one cannot grasp its overarching principles.\n\nIt also says: *\"If the punitive *qi* direction is incomplete, restore it and connect with the **virtue/power direction** (福德方)—this brings long-term auspiciousness.\"*\n\nIt also says: *\"The punitive *qi* direction’s walls and structures should be **narrow and thin**, guarding against their being **lofty and vigorous**.\"* The **virtue/power direction** (福德方) and its walls and structures should be **connected and sturdy** for the household.\n\nIt also says: *\"If the punitive *qi* direction is **constricted and repeatedly constricted**, calamities and disasters will still fearlessly pursue. If the virtue/power direction is **expanded and repeatedly expanded**, descendants will enjoy prosperity and joy. The punitive *qi* direction must be **guarded against encroachment and expansion**; if too constricted, the *qi* will be insufficient, and insufficient *qi* will diminish wealth and fortune. The virtue/power direction must also be **guarded against excessive encroachment and expansion**; if too extreme, the **virtue/power** and **punitive *qi*** will become negligible, failing to **dissipate the thick auspicious *qi*** that descends upon it.\"*\n\nIf **any direction is excessive or encroached upon beyond its original proportion**, it is called **excessive**.\n\nIt also says: *\"A residence has **Five Emptinesses** (五虚), which bring poverty and depletion; and **Five Fullnesses** (五实), which bring wealth and nobility.\nThe **Five Emptinesses**:\n1. A large residence with few people (**大人少**).\n2. A large residence with a small gate (**宅门大内小**).\n3. Incomplete walls and courtyards (**墙院不完**).\n4. A well or water source without proper positioning (**井鳌不处**).\n5. A residence with **excessive land and insufficient houses, or overly spacious courtyards** (宅地多、屋少、庭院广).\n\nThe **Five Fullnesses**:\n1. A small residence with many people (**宅小人多**).\n2. A large residence with a small gate (**宅大门小**).\n3. Complete walls and courtyards (**墙院完全**).\n4. A small residence with many livestock (**宅小六畜多**).\n5. Water channels that **flow northward** (水沟束南流).\n\nIt also says: *\"If a residence gradually flourishes, do not abandon the courtyard. If it does not decline, do not move—otherwise, calamity will follow. If one seeks a broader dwelling, it is not necessarily joyful; if one builds only half, one will certainly attain longevity.\"* A residence should not be overly broad.\n\nIt also says: *\"Though its fields may be fertile, weeding and tilling will make them flourish; though its residence may be good, modifying and moving will make it prosperous.\"*",

The **Eight Trigrams (八卦)** and **Nine Palaces (九宫)** display **forms and symbols (形象)**, aligning with **male and female positions (男女之位)**.\n\nAt the **winter solstice (冬至)**, the **sacred (圣)** reaches the **fourth heavenly stem (巳)** to the **eleventh heavenly stem (亥)**—this marks the **extreme divergence (极处)** of **yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)** in their **ascendancy (起盛)**. The **sage (圣人)** mapped the **Eight Trigrams (八卦)** upon the earth, arranging the **palaces of males and females (女男之宫)**.

Over time, this brings **joy and blessings (吉庆)**.\nIf one **faces the auspicious (刑祸方)**, misfortune will **persist (久久不利)**.\n\nOne must also **avoid (忌)**:\nA **tortoise-head hall (龟头厅)** situated on **land of the seventh heavenly stem (午地)** and **facing north (向北)** to **clash (冲)** with the **auspicious (日凶亭)**.\nEven a **slightly elevated (稍高)** and **sturdy (坚)** dwelling is **inauspicious (不利)**.\nThe **precept (诀)** states: *\"A tortoise-head hall on the seventh heavenly stem (龟头午) will **easily change ownership (易主)** or **harm the master (妨主)**.\"*\nIf such a hall exists in any **courtyard (院)**, it is **inauspicious (不吉)**.\n\nMoreover, if a **residence (宅)** has **high towers or pavilions (高楼大榭)**** on the fourth heavenly stem (午)**, fifth heavenly stem (巳)**, or sixth heavenly stem (己)**—all facing **east (东)** or **south (巽)**—they are **inauspicious (不利)** and should be **removed (去之)** for **auspiciousness (吉)**.",
