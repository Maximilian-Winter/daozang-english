The parting of life and death,\nWailing and weeping break the human heart.\nVast and distant, Heaven and Earth divide—\nWho can bear this suffering?\nThe Great Sage pities all,\nCommanding the Kings of the Five Paths.\nEach bears the ledger of life and death,\nArriving at the Hall of the Long Night.\nSummoning the Overseer of Execution,\nThe Ox-Head guards of Mount Tai,\nAnd restraining the officials of the Three Realms,\nThe Dragon Courier proclaims to the Ten Directions.\nThe dead have suffered enough—\nSwiftly deliver them to the Southern Palace.\nClothed and fed from Heaven’s kitchen,\nLifetimes after lifetime, they shall dwell in realms of bliss.\n\nThe disciple bows three times to the west,\nEradicating the sins of twelve kalpas of life and death.\n\nLofty and remote, the Three Heavens above,\nTowering and majestic, how sublime!\nOf the great sins under Heaven,\nNone surpasses the betrayal of loyalty and filial piety.\nFor ten thousand kalpas, they enter the Long Night,\nForever barred from reanimation.\nIf such transgressions existed in past lives,\nCalamity shall pursue them in this one.\nThus, their years are cut short in their prime,\nAs *hun* and *po* scatter together.\nParents, spouse, and children part,\nAnd the spirit finds no refuge.\nLife ends like a mountain’s collapse,\nLike waters flowing ever eastward.\nThus, ponder the suffering of the dead—\nBitterly, it moves one to sorrow.\nBeneath the pines and cypresses,\nWhen shall they return from the long sleep?\n\nThe disciple bows three times to the southeast,\nEradicating the sins of eighteen kalpas of life and death.\n\nThe joys of Heaven’s halls are boundless,\nYet in Jambudvīpa, the Five Desires abound.\nWhat misfortune did they commit in past lives,\nThat their lives ended so swiftly?\nWhere do the *hun* and *po* flee,\nAnd to which hell do the spirits drift?\nParents, spouse, and children part,\nSeparation like a collapsing house.\nAmidst the Three Realms’ vast expanse,\nTo whom do the spirits belong?\nFools see nothing,\nAnd their words chill the heart and eyes.\nOnly by being born in the Southern Palace,\nLifetime after lifetime, may they feast on Heaven’s bounty.\n\nThe disciple bows three times to the north,\nEradicating the sins of a thousand kalpas of life and death.\n\nFrom what origin did their past lives arise,\nThat in this life, they met the pure Dao?\nThrough the guidance of an enlightened teacher,\nThey received the wondrous and mysterious treasure.\nYet how deep were their karmic roots,\nThat they were suddenly cut down before old age?\nSwiftly, their flourishing years were severed,\nAnd their lives ended so prematurely.\nThe *hun* and *po* enter the Long Night,\nThe spirit wanders the Five Paths.\nThe Four Great Elements scatter here,\nThe Six Realms traverse suffering and torment.\nLifetime after lifetime, they wail in sorrow,\nTheir past selves grieving in their hearts.\nWhy not deliver the deceased?\nWealth and possessions are but grass.\nEstablish the fast, bestow great alms,\nAnd lifetime after lifetime, they shall meet their teacher’s protection.\n\nThe disciple bows nine times to the north,\nEradicating the sins of thirty kalpas of life and death.\n\nAll seek the Dao,\nYet their hearts are not sincere in seeking.\nEnvy, hatred, and the Three Poisons arise,\nCasting them into the City of Doubt.\nSeated, they utter empty words,\nAnd the Nine Dark Realms tremble in alarm.\nThe dead enter evil paths—\nWhen shall they gaze upon the Great Clarity?\nAlas! The suffering of the dead,\nHow dark the groves and mounds!\nToday, deliver the deceased,\nOnly wishing for their next rebirth.\n\nThe disciple bows twelve times to the north,\nEradicating the sins of forty-nine kalpas of life and death.\n\nIn past lives, no merit was cultivated,\nAnd in this life, they endure constant suffering.\nHow grievous the pain of the dead,\nAs they revolve through the mechanism of the Five Paths!\nLike water pouring into the sea,\nOnce gone, when shall they return?\nSpouse and children part thus,\nParents—who shall know them?\nIn the dark Long Night,\nHow vast the burial mounds!\nThe living weep day and night,\nWishing for their reanimation.\nAlas! The suffering of the dead—\nSwiftly, it moves one to sorrow.\n\nThe disciple bows three times to the south,\nEradicating the sins of thirty kalpas of life and death.\n\nWhy do the living find joy,\nWhile the dead endure such suffering?\nBeneath the dark and distant groves,\nAbove lies the fleeting earth.\nIn the depths of the Yellow Springs,\nWhere do the spirits turn?\nSpouse, children, and parents part,\nUltimately falling among the seven ancestors.\nBreath follows the wind and dust,\nAnd the *hun* and *po*—to whom do they belong?\nThe dead shall not live again,\nGazing at Heaven—Heaven has no pillars.\nThe clay rooster shall not crow,\nThe wooden man shall not speak.\nAlas! It wounds the human heart,\nBitterly, it severs the liver and spine.\nEstablish the fast to deliver the deceased—\nWhere may one leave their lingering attachments?\n\nMay the deceased attain a corporeal form once more,\nAscend as an immortal, and deliver the seven ancestors.\nThe disciple bows twelve times to the south,\nEradicating the sins of seventy-two kalpas of life and death.\n\nThe foolish in this turbid world,\nInverted in perception, how can they know the truth?\nThey know not father and mother,\nNor lord and minister.\nThey comprehend not the matters of past and future,\nNor distinguish the old from the new.\nClinging to ignorance, their lives are cut short,\nAnd their *hun* and *po* sink into perdition.\nThe Five Paths divide their course,\nShouldering the long night’s endless burden.\nOnly the wailing for the dead is heard,\nNo joyful souls are seen.\nUnmet by a master of past lives,\nIn an instant, their spirit perishes.\nToday, for the deliverance of the deceased,\nMay their risen corpse and soul be seen.\nConceived in this very hour,\nThey soar in but a moment’s flight.\nEver to attend the Most High,\nDispelling sorrow at the Northern Gate.\nYet, bearing the talisman, they turned from their master,\nAnd for generations, the seven ancestors remain benighted.\n\nThe disciple bows twelve times to the northwest,\nEradicating the sins of thirty kalpas of life and death.\nIn former lives, they delighted in killing,\nTheir lives cut short, resenting the gods.\nThe reckless speak of betraying their master,\nFor ten thousand kalpas, tormented by the soldiers of the Nine Darknesses.\nTheir souls become vicious beasts,\nFor countless ages, unable to assume a virtuous form.\nIn this life, they die young,\nEnduring all five sufferings without exception.\nTheir *hun* and *po* return to Heaven and Earth,\nBut where does their spirit find rebirth?\nThe Great Sage pities them in sorrow,\nAlas! It wounds the human heart.\nLoose tongues slander others,\nTheir clamorous voices harm the living.\nToday, for the deliverance of the deceased,\nMay they regain a human form.\nThe seven ancestors return to the Southern Palace,\nWelcomed by the Three Heavens and Nine Dragons.\n\nThe disciple bows nine times to the west,\nEradicating the sins of thirty kalpas of life and death.\nFar, far above, the Terrace of the Nine Heavens,\nTowering, the Purple Phoenix City.\nAlas! The suffering of the Three Realms,\nSorrow and calamity converge.\nI mourn and ask the foolish of this world,\nWhy do they not seek long life?\nDisbelieving the Great Sage’s teachings,\nThey suddenly depart, the Four Elements scattered.\nAll day, they commit evil deeds,\nUnmindful of their lives’ impending ruin.\nBoiling cauldrons and sword-lined trees,\nEven their pleas for mercy go unheeded.\nToday, for their deliverance,\nMay they regain a human form.\n\nThe disciple bows nine times to the east,\nEradicating the sins of three kalpas of life and death.\nDestiny’s course, inner and outer,\nThe majestic Great Luo Heaven.\nTherein dwell the deathless ones,\nSeated upright for countless ages.\nYet, bearing the master’s teachings, they betrayed them,\nAnd for generations, linger in the long night.\nAmidst the Five Paths and Three Ways,\nDrawn and bound by the Nine Darknesses.\nSuch sinners as these,\nHow can they attain immortality in the kalpas of water?\nToday’s untimely death,\nStems from the causes of former lives.\nEnvious of the talented and wise,\nThey cut short their own lives.\nWhen the great assembly’s time arrives,\nThe demon-slayers will show no mercy.\nHaving failed to accumulate good deeds,\nEven in haste, no grace is granted.\nEstablish the fast to deliver the deceased,\nBestow alms to open the Dao’s gate.\n\nThe disciple bows three times to the west,\nAnd the departed shall attain liberation.\nHeaven and Earth endure forever,\nThe Three Luminaries shine resplendently.\nThe Five Phases align with the four seasons,\nThe mysterious workings never decay.\nWhat sin has the deceased committed,\nTo suddenly fall into the cold courtyard?\nThey know not wife and children,\nNor recognize father and elder brother.\nThe Four Elements swiftly depart,\nThe body disperses, yet the name remains.\nOn what do their *hun* and *po* rely?\nWhere does their spirit find rebirth?\nToday, for their deliverance,\nMay they regain a human form.\n\nThe disciple bows nine times to the west,\nEradicating the sins of ten thousand kalpas of life and death.\nThe Four Noble Truths guide the Brahmanic practices,\nThe Six Perfections transcend worldly traces.\nThe Three Poisons remain unchecked,\nWhat use is bearing the Three Caverns’ teachings?\nServing the master with a self-centered heart,\nThey cannot ride the Nine Dragons.\nThus, their lives cut short in death,\nThey rush headlong through the Five Paths’ crossroads.\nWith a doubting heart,\nHow can they cross the flood of disaster?\nToday, for the deliverance of the deceased,\nMay they behold the Immortal Lords.\n\nThe disciple bows nine times to the west,\nEradicating the sins of thirty thousand kalpas of life and death.\nAll seek life,\nYet the foolish gain no benefit.\nBearing the registers, they envy their master,\nFor generations, estranged from the sages.\nThough they aspire to soar,\nThey cannot ascend the Jade Calendar.\nThus, their lives cut short in death,\nTheir names inscribed in the Nine Darknesses’ ledgers.\nTheir *hun*, *po*, and spirit scatter,\nWhen shall the long night release them?\nIn life, what did they plan?\nEver greedy and miserly with wealth.\nOnce gone, for all time,\nHow can they know wood from stone?\nToday, for their deliverance,\nMay their misfortunes and transgressions be absolved.\n\nThe disciple bows twelve times to the west,\nEradicating the sins of three thousand kalpas of life and death.\nHeavenly beings descend to transform,\nYet the foolish do not study.\nEach seeks to profit the world and nourish themselves,\nGrasping at fleeting gains.\nThey vie in jealousy for fame and rank,\nEach boasting, striving to outdo the other.\nDisrespecting masters and slighting friends,\nFor ten thousand kalpas, they cannot attain immortality.\nIn death, they enter the Nine Darknesses,\nFor generations, sinking into the abyss of the long night.\nTheir *hun* and *po* rush through the Five Paths,\nThrough boiling cauldrons and knife-lined mountains.\nToday, for the deliverance of the deceased,\nMay the departed ascend to Heaven.\nMay all sins be absolved,\nAnd they wander freely before the Most High.\n\nThe disciple bows three times to the east,\nEradicating the sins of ninety kalpas of life and death.\nThe Four Talismans are the foundation of practice,\nThe Six Perfections all radiate mysterious light.\nReceiving the Dao with an uncompassionate heart,\nThey shorten their own lives.\nWith doubt lingering in their hearts,\nHow can they avoid an early death?\nServing the master as an ordinary person,\nTheir errors bring forth calamity.\nStingy and greedy, they fail to make offerings,\nFor generations, they encounter famine and desolation.\nLoose tongues reveal secret teachings,\nIn the next life, they fall into boiling cauldrons.\nToday, for the deliverance of the deceased,\nMay they soon be reborn in Heaven.\nAs daughters, they become noblewomen,\nAs sons, they become lords and kings.\n\nThe disciple bows three times to the south,\nEradicating the sins of ten kalpas of life and death.\nWhen the deceased first entered the palace of death,\nThe living performed meritorious deeds for them.\nMonthly, they are delivered,\nFreed from the crossroads of the Five Paths.\nOn the six fast days and ten auspicious days,\nAnd the three sevens, calamities are averted.\nOn *gengshen* and *jiazi* days,\nNo Perfected One fails to attend.\nToday, for the deliverance of the deceased,\nMay they ride the Nine Dragons.\nMeeting the Most High in life and death,\nFor generations, may they behold the Immortal Lords.\n\nThe disciple bows nine times to the north,\nEradicating the sins of a thousand kalpas of life and death.\nThe wise accumulate myriad good deeds,\nAnd through good deeds, attain immortality.\nIf the dead are not delivered,\nHow can their *hun* and *po* ascend?\nIn former lives, they did no good,\nAnd now they wander at Hell’s gate.\nI ask, what sin have they committed?\nIt lies in their careless words.\n\nEternally bound in the Nine Dark Realms,\nWhen shall they ascend as immortals again?\nAdrift within the Three Wretched Paths,\nDragged by the Six Bandits’ chains.\nToday, we deliver them,\nPracticing the Dao to return to Nature’s embrace.\nThe rites of three, five, seven, and nine,\nEstablishing fasts to cultivate fields of blessing.\n\nThe disciple bows nine times to the south,\nEradicating the sins of forty kalpas of life and death.\nThe human body is like the five grains,\nTurning in their destined cycles.\nSown with depth or shallowness,\nGood and evil each take form.\nFool and sage stand worlds apart,\nAs do the strong and the frail.\nIron may be soft or hard,\nAs water may be muddy or clear.\nAmong men, some are greedy and reckless,\nWhile others are virtuous, steadfast, and true.\nOnly the living know joy,\nNever do the dead see glory.\nIn the endless night of darkness,\nWhen will the kalpas’ wheel cease turning?\nThe Most High pities all,\nAlas, how sorrowful the human condition!\n\nThe disciple bows three times to the east,\nEradicating the sins of six kalpas of life and death.\nJambudvīpa is no land of blessing,\nWhere sinners torment one another.\nUnknowing of life’s brevity,\nThey vie only for fame and gain.\nWith selfish hearts, they envy the good,\nSeeking fleeting glory for themselves.\nDemanding others’ offerings,\nUnmindful of their great fate’s collapse.\nRushing to advance themselves,\nThey incur the gods’ reproach.\nSuddenly, they enter the eternal dark,\nWhere the Yellow Springs stretch boundless.\nPity the foolish of this world,\nFor this body cannot long endure.\nThose who practice good and attain immortality,\nStand firm for ten thousand generations.\n\nThe disciple bows three times to the west,\nEradicating the sins of three kalpas of life and death.\nThe Nine Dark Realms teem with the wicked,\nWhile the good do not dwell there.\nDragons shun barren hills,\nAnd sacred fish avoid stagnant wells.\nIn former lives, they lacked merit,\nDenied the celestial kitchens’ fare.\nWith careless words, they slandered their masters,\nAnd death came in an instant.\nTheir *hun* and *po* wander the Five Paths,\nTheir spirit returns to emptiness.\nAdrift in the Nine Dark Realms,\nFor ten thousand kalpas, they traverse the Three Wretched Paths.\nToday, we deliver the deceased,\nMay they follow the dragon and wild duck.\n\nThe disciple bows seven times to the north,\nEradicating the sins of ten thousand kalpas of life and death.\nEndlessly, they guard the coffin,\nDimly glimpsing the Purple Court.\nThose who follow the Dao and seek the highest immortals,\nFirst find an enlightened master.\nBearing the *Yuji* Covenant at their waist,\nThey hold all the sacred scriptures.\nSkilled in a hundred arts,\nThey too may master the Dao.\nYet how the dead suffer,\nLosing all merit and name in an instant.\nToday, we deliver the deceased,\nMay they all ascend to the Phoenix City.\n\nThe disciple bows three times to the north,\nEradicating the sins of ten thousand kalpas of life and death.\nImmortals live for ten thousand kalpas,\nYet fools remain unaware.\nClutching the covenant without compassion,\nThey court their own destruction.\nWith their tongues, they slander others,\nBringing swift death—who is to blame?\nA fierce tiger cannot be tethered,\nNor a divine dragon restrained.\nThis awaits the worthy and sage,\nNot for fools to ride.\nPity the suffering of the dead,\nAs their spirits race through the Five Paths.\nToday, we seek to deliver them,\nTo ascend as immortals, ever free.\n\nThe disciple bows seven times to the west,\nEradicating the sins of thirty thousand kalpas of life and death.\nAll men must die,\nFor all things are impermanent.\nEven sages undergo *shijie*,\nTransforming to ascend to heaven.\nThe heavy in sin meet early death,\nWhile the good enjoy prolonged life.\nWealth and poverty, high and low,\nAll depend on the strength of one’s fortune.\nThe wicked and stubborn reject the Dao,\nHow then can they meet the Immortal Kings?\nGreat compassion pities all,\nBreaking hearts with sorrow.\nThe deliverance rites now complete,\nEach bows in reverence to the Jade Emperor.\n\nThe disciple bows nine times to the northwest,\nEradicating the sins of a thousand kalpas of life and death.\nThe *Lingbao* Mysterious Chapter for the Deliverance of the Dead from the Nine Dark Realms and the Rising of the Corpse is now complete.",
