  "full_translation": "**The *Zhenxu Bai Gui Zhongzhi* (Central Guide to the Empty and White Array)**\n*A Treatise by Chen Chongsu (元陈冲素)*\n*(Author’s life unknown; possibly Chen Zhixu 陈致虚)*\n*Two scrolls*\n*Source: *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), Dunzhen (洞真) Section, Methods Category (方法类)*\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One: The First Principle—Stillness of the Mind**\n\n*\"When essence is full, do not lust after color;\nWhen qi is full, do not crave food.\"*\n\n*\"The ears of a bright and clear man are sharp—\nHongjun’s gift, yet poverty he does not know.\nOnly by probing the Moon’s Cavern do things reveal themselves;\nOnly by following the Heavenly Root does one recognize humanity.\"*\n\n*\"When Heaven meets Xun, observe the Moon’s Cavern;\nWhen Earth meets Lei, behold the Heavenly Root.\nBetween the Heavenly Root and Moon’s Cavern, one wanders freely—\nThirty-six palaces, all spring.\"*\n\n○ *\"When the thought arises, be instantly aware;\nWhen aware, it vanishes—\nThe wondrous gate of cultivation lies here.\"*\n\n*\"This method is not complex; the Master teaches refinement:\nSo long as a single thread of thought remains unchecked,\nWhere shall you find its trace?\"*\n\n*\"The state of no-thought is not like the dullness of earth, stone, or wood—\nIt is the stillness of *zhengnian* (正念, right awareness).*\n*When right awareness manifests, light returns and illuminates—\nIt directs the rod to govern the qi,\nIt guides the qi back to the spirit.*\n*The spirit condenses into a black mass—\nThus, mercury and lead are formed.*\n*Seize the wild horse of the mind, tame the monkey of the heart—\nSlowly refine the mercury and lead with diligent practice.\"*\n\n*\"The Great Dao teaches first to still the mind;\nIf thoughts persist, all effort is in vain.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Second Principle: Gathering the Elixir**\n\n*\"When the heart moves, the spirit cannot enter the qi;\nWhen the body moves, the qi cannot enter the spirit—\nSilently nurture the heart, and the spirit forgets its form.\"*\n\n*\"The gatherer of the elixir harvests the medicines within the body.\nThe medicines of the body are spirit, qi, and essence—\nTo gather them is to collect and store the mind and body,\nTo still the heart so that spirit and qi remain whole—\nThus, the furnace is established, the cauldron set,\nAnd the divine pill is refined.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Third Principle: Recognizing the Furnace and Cauldron**\n\n*\"The Mysterious Female (玄牝)*\n*The True Person plunges into the Deep Abyss.\"*\n\n「Floating and Wandering in the Center of the Rules\n\n*The Mysterious Female (玄牝),\nHer whiteness like cotton, her continuity like a ring—\nThough vast only by one inch and two *fen*,\nShe contains the essence of the entire body.*\n\nTo secure the longevity of the *Grain Spirit (谷神)*,\nOne must rely on the Mysterious Female as the foundation.\nWhen the true essence returns to the *Yellow Court (黄金室)*,\nA single luminous pearl forever remains.\n\n**The Fourth Principle: Igniting the Elixir**\n*Godly Vitality (神) is Fire,\nQi is the Elixir.*\nSeize the central substance of the *Kan (坎)* position,\nAnd kindle the *Yin (阴)* within the *Li (离)* palace’s embrace.\nFrom this point onward, the body transforms into the *Qian (乾)* vitality—\nHidden yet soaring, all depends on the mind’s intent.\n\n**The Fifth Principle: The Union of Kan and Li**\n*Pursue the Two Qi (二炁) along the Yellow Dao (黄道),\nConverge the Three Natures (三性) in the Primordial Palace (元宫).*\nThe *Lead Dragon (铅龙)* ascends, the *Mercury Tiger (汞虎)* descends.\nDrive the Two Substances (二物) without letting them stray.\nThis union of *Kan* and *Li*—\nAlso called the *Small Heavenly Cycle (小周天)*.\nWithin the first hundred days of establishment,\nOne observes Fire and Water ascending and descending in the *Central Palace (中宫)*,\nYin and Yang blending in the *Alchemical Cauldron (丹鼎)*,\nClouds gathering, rain dispersing,\nQi condensing, spirit solidifying—\nThis is the verification.\n\n*Zhongyuan’s True Person (紫阳真人)* said:\n*\"When the Dragon and Tiger unite in mutual affection,\nKan and Li meet, and conception begins.\nA single ladleful of *Qian-Kun Essence (乾坤髓)*—\nFocused intent, and its elixir is attained.\"*\n\n**The Sixth Principle: The Union of Qian and Kun**\n*Comparing the Barriers (比栏)*\n*Upper and Lower Passes (上下关) in brief...*\n\n「The Diagram is the Same\n　　*Kan* and *Li* unite both internally and externally—\n　　The Three Passes* become transparent without effort.\n　　From the *Alchemical Field (Dan Tian)* to the *Marrow Gathering (Ni Wan Ding)*,\n　　The *River Car (He Che)* moves freely countless times.\n\n*Langran Zi* said:\n　　The *Double Passes of the Spine (Jia Ji Shuang Guan)* pierce the *Gate of the Vertex (Ding Men)*—\n　　This is the supreme path of cultivation.\n　　Frequently swallow the *Divine Water of Hua Chi (Hua Chi Shen Shui)*,\n　　The *Empress of the Purple Palace (Zi Fu Yuan Jun)* ascends directly.\n　　Keep the *Qi* surging through the *Passes and Nodes (Guan Jie)*,\n　　And naturally, *vital essence* will fill the *Grain of the Valley (Gu Shen)*.*\n\nOnce the *Path of the Long Sky (Chang Kong Lu)* is attained,\nOne must thank the teacher who first guided them.\n\n**The Union of Qian and Kun is also called the *Great Heavenly Cycle (Da Zhou Tian)***.\nIt appears only after the union of *Kan* and *Li*—\nFor the medicine has already formed, and now it emerges.\n\nThe Right Secret says:\n　　*Li* arises from beneath *Kan*,\n　　*Dui* is born within the *Alchemical Cauldron (Dan Ding)*.\n　　*Li* is Fire, *Kan* is Water,\n　　*Dui* is Metal, and Metal is the Medicine.\n　　This means igniting the Fire within Water,\n　　To refine the Medicine in the Cauldron.\n　　*Zhuangzi* says: \"Fire within Water, and the Great Block* is formed.\"\n　　*Yu Can* says: \"A single point of *True Yang (Zhen Yang)* arises within *Kan*,\n　　Filling the void of *Li* Palace.\"\n\n*Creation and Transformation (Zao Hua)* proceed silently—\nFire rises within Water, like at the *Empty Peril Hole (Xu Wei Xue)*.\n*Dan Yang’s True Person* says:\n　　When Fire emerges from Water, cease all thoughts of scenery,\n　　When Snow wraps around Flowers, extinguish all consciousness of Spring.\n　　Such are its signs.\n\nThe *Spine (Jia Ji)* resembles a *cart axle*,\nThe four limbs like *mountain stones*,\nThe two kidneys like *boiling soup*,\nThe bladder like *searing heat*.\nWithin a single breath,\nThe *Heavenly Mechanism (Tian Ji)* moves on its own—\nLightly yet naturally, silently yet with *qi*,\nSubtly guiding the mind to settle the breath,\nResponding to the *pivotal mechanism of Creation and Transformation (Zao Hua Shou Ji)*,\nThen Wood and Metal blend naturally,\nWater and Fire ascend and descend naturally.\nSuddenly, a single point grows large as a *millet pearl*,\nFalling into the *Yellow Court (Huang Ting)*.\nUsing the method of *Refining Lead and Investing Mercury (Cai Qian Tou Gong)*,\nWithin a hundred days, one forms a day’s worth of elixir.\n\nAt this moment,\nThe body and mind merge with the void—\nOne does not know the body as oneself,\nNor oneself as the body.\nOne also does not know the spirit as *qi*,\nNor the *qi* as the spirit.\nSuch is Creation and Transformation—\nNeither *visualization* nor *action*,\nYet naturally so, without knowing how.\n\n*The Chapter on Restoring the Command (Fu Ming Pian)* says:\n　　The *mud snake dances beneath the well*,\n　　The *moonlight shines through the window on a plum*.\n　　Last night, the *Chaos* collapsed into the earth,\n　　And all ten thousand phenomena* are unknown.\n　　The Seventh Principle: *Gathering and Condensing the Fire Refining (Zuan Cuo Huo Hou)*\n　　*Upper Pillar of Heaven (Shang Zhu Tian)*, *Lower Pillar of Earth (Xia Zhu Di)*—\n　　Only this is the *Cauldron Vessel (Ding Qi)*.\n　　Once the method is known, the work is easy.\n　　*Guard the Duty (Shou Zhi)*.」\n\n---\n*Annotations preserved from

steadfast.\nDragon’s virtue lies in concealment—do not advance lightly.\n\nAdvancing the Fire, the second nine:\n*\"Dragon Appears in the Field\"*—rightly positioned.\nFan the gentle wind, refine the fire’s work.\nIn an instant, the cauldron glows red—\nDragon in the Field, traversing the void many times.\n\nAdding the Fire, the third nine:\n*\"Persevering All Day\"*—guard the achievement.\nHeaven and Earth unite; yin and yang balance.\nEight parts mercury, half a *jin* of lead.\nThe maiden’s embrace, the infant’s gaze upward—\nBathing in purity.\n\nThe fourth nine, *\"Leaping in the Abyss\"*—double abyss.\nFire restrains fire; metal conquers wood.\nAt this stage, bathing is fitting.\nLeaping in the abyss, preserve sincerity in solitude.\n\nThe fifth nine, *\"Flying Dragon in Heaven\"*—\nThe sixth nine, *\"Soaring Dragon Overwhelms\"*—\nThe seventh nine, *\"Meeting\"*—\n\nThe first six, *\"Retreating\"*—\nThe second six, *\"Opposition\"*—\nThe third six, *\"Contemplation\"*—\nThe fourth six—\n\nThe essence of mercury must ascend, the essence of lead must descend.\nAt this time, it is proper to guard with utmost caution.\nSeal the bottom of the cauldron, bind its mouth tightly.\nRetreat the fire—**戌 戌 剥**—\nThe fifth six: *\"Yellow Robe, Supreme Good Fortune\"*—return to its place.\nEmpty its heart, fill its belly.\nGuard tranquility, await the return of yang.\nMove for but a moment, and the full cycle is complete.\n\nWild battle—**亥 亥 坤**—\nThe sixth upper: *\"Dragon Fights in the Wild\"*—guard stillness.\nWhen the group of yang is exhausted, the cinnabar light fades.\nAt the utmost refinement, the primordial *qi* rests.\nGather and settle within, *\"Yellow Robe, Supreme Good Fortune.\"*\n\nNurture the fire—when yin is concealed, yang is reborn.\nAt this stage, vigilance is required.\nIf encountering *\"Wild Battle,\"* its blood will be dark and yellow.\nThe eighth stage: *\"Yang Spirit Frees from the Fetal Shell\"*—\nTip over the cauldron, overturn the furnace.\nThe work is complete, yielding the black pearl.\nReturn to the root, restore the command—embrace the origin and return to emptiness.\n\n○ Three hundred days of fire, ten days of gestation.\nIts spirit departs the body, coming and going in an instant.\nGazing back upon its former form, it is but a pile of dung.\nAt ten steps or a hundred steps, one must cautiously survey.\nThe child is young and not yet fully formed,\nRelying on the nurturing virtue of its parents.\n\nNine years and three months, and all human affairs are exhausted,\nRoaming the heavens and earth without constraint from kin.\nThe ninth stage: *\"Forgotten Spirit Merges with Emptiness\"*—\nThough the spirit exists beyond the body, it is still not wondrous.\nWhen the void is shattered into dust, only then does the whole body reveal itself.\n\n○ The Supreme Dao/Way’s gate is known by few,\nThe profound and the original are indistinguishably alike.\nLifting the symbols of sun and moon to return to the primal form,\nLeaping beyond the techniques of the world to perceive the Great Emptiness.\nRefining until form and spirit both achieve perfection,\nOne then knows the beginning before parents were born.\n\nWho conveys these truths? The Master without mouth teaches them to me.\nZhang Zhenren’s *解佩令*—\nThe yang spirit departs the body, dim and distant,\nIn a flash, it wanders unseen through the Three Islands.\nEntering and exiting with pure familiarity,\nPressing and releasing as one seeks deeper mysteries.\n\nUniting with the True Emptiness, the Void is perfected—all is complete.\n\n---\n\n**Internal Alchemy’s Three Essentials**\nThe three essentials of internal alchemy are: **the Mysterious Mother (玄牝)**, medicinal substances, and fire regulation.\nThe *Dan Jing* says: *\"Squeeze it for hidden meaning—yellow silk, a maiden in her youth.\"*\nLet the reader ponder this.\n\nI, though verbose, now speak plainly for all to understand.\nThough my words are detailed, my intent is to clarify—\nEach word is a true secret, revealed as if to a brother.\nI conceal the mechanisms of transformation,\nPiercing the marrow of yin and yang,\nThe unspoken mysteries of past and present—\nAll are here.\n\nLike a whale swallowing the sea, the coral branches are fully exposed.\n\n**Diagram of the Mysterious Mother**\nThe verse reads:\n\n**Diagram of the Mysterious Mother**\n\nThe verse reads:\n*\"From the primal chaos, the round chaos is born—\nWithin it, secrets too profound to be told.\nSplit open the orifice within the orifice within,\nTread upon the heaven beyond heaven beyond.\nOnly when the Dipper’s handle reverses does form appear,\nOnly when the platform’s light returns does the immortal arise.\nOne morning, scooping the moon from the pond’s heart,\nPiercing the Hu’s monk’s wall-gazing meditation—\nAll is revealed.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Diagram of Medicinal Substances**\nThe verse reads:\n*\"On Five-Skandha Mountain, snow lies thick and white,\nWhere deep in the clouds, fragrant herbs grow bright.\nThe Buddha of Vajra Sound plants them in due season,\nWhile the Primordial Sovereign tends them with his own hands.\nThe Stone Maiden rides the dragon to pluck the two true roots,\nThe Wooden Man mounts the tiger to gather frost-dewed herbs.\nRich or poor, all households possess them—\nOnce discovered, return with but a single pound.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Diagram of Fire Regulation**\nThe verse reads:\n*\"The True Person of No Rank refines the Great Elixir,\nLeaning on void, his long sword chills the air.\nIn the jade furnace, the Celestial Sovereign’s marrow is tempered,\nIn the golden cauldron, the Patriarch’s liver is simmered.\nA hundred moments of cold and warmth, meticulously measured,\nSix hexagrams of yin and yang—stillness holds the key.\nShould one ask of the true furnace and crucible,\nIt is none other than the crimson flesh of today.\"*\n\n---\n\n**The Mysterious Mother**\n*The Awakening to Reality* states:\n*\"To make the Valley Spirit eternal, one must rely on the Mysterious Mother as the foundation.\nOnce the true essence returns to the Yellow Room,\nA single luminous pearl will never depart.\"*\n\nThe body contains one orifice, called the **Mysterious Mother**—\nIt receives *qi* to generate life and is truly the divine storehouse,\nWhere the Three Primordials converge without distinction.\nSpirit, soul, and essence all gather here—\nIt is the root of the Golden Elixir’s return,\nThe sacred womb where immortals condense their embryo.\n\nThe ancients called it:\n*The蒂 of the Supreme Ultimate, the handle of the Primordial, the root of the Void, the origin of Chaos, the Valley of the Great Emptiness, the source of Transformation, the Return-to-Root orifice, the Reclaim-Life Pass, the Steward-Earth Gate, the Regenerate-Heaven Chamber, the Gate of Jia-Yi, the Hall of Geng-Xin, the Door of Jia-Yi, the Southwest Quarter, the Abode of True Unity, the Central Yellow Chamber, the Dan Foundation, the One-Cultivation Altar, the Crescent Furnace, the Cinnabar Crucible, the Dragon-Tiger Den, the Yellow Granny’s Lodge, the Lead Furnace and Earthen Cauldron, the Divine Water and Flower Pool, the Imperial One’s Divine Chamber, the Soul’s Crimson Palace*—\nAll refer to the same place.\n\nYet within the body, it is neither mouth nor nose,\nNeither heart nor kidney, neither liver nor lung,\nNor spleen, nor stomach, nor navel wheel,\nNor tailbone, nor bladder, nor the genital passage,\nNor the orifice between the two kidneys,\nNor the point one inch below the navel,\nNor the Clear Hall or the Mud Pillow,\nNor the Gate of Life or the Sea of Vitality.\n\nThen where is it?\nMy secret technique is called **\"the Center of the Rule\"**—\nWith single-minded focus, the embryo-immortal is formed.\n\n*The Classic of Harmony* says:\n*\"The True Person hides in the deep abyss,\nFloating and guarding the Center of the Rule.\"*\nThis is its location.\n\n*Laozi* says:\n*\"Much speech leads to exhaustion—\nBetter to guard the Center.\"*\n\nIt lies beneath *Qian*, above *Kun*,\nWest of *Zhen*, east of *Dui*—\nThe realm where *Kan* and *Li* (water and fire) copulate.\n\nA human body is the very center of Heaven and Earth.\nEight vessels and nine orifices, veins and meridians converge here—\nA vacant orifice, suspended like a millet grain,\nNeither form nor substance, yet born of the Dao itself.\nSeemingly present, yet absent;\nSeemingly lost, yet existing—\nNeither inside nor outside,\nYet containing *Qian* and *Kun* within.\nThe Yellow Center harmonizes with principle,\nResiding in its proper position.\n\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*\"Only the pure and singular—\nFirmly grasp the Center.\"*\n\n*The Scripture of Guiding Others* says:\n*\"The Center harmonizes the Five *Qi*,\nMerging with the Hundred Spirits.\"*\n\nMaster Cui called it *\"Piercing the Tailbone, Communing with the Mud Pillow.\"*\nPure Yang named it *\"The Origin of Life’s Breath, the First Reception of Qi.\"*\n\nMaster Ping said:\n*\"I urge you to seek the origin of life’s breath.\"*\n\nThis is where the Primordial *Qi* arises,\nWhere the true breath originates.\nThus, Yuè Chán also called it *\"The place where the mind moves.\"*\n\nThose who cultivate the Elixir, if they fail to understand this orifice,\nWill not stabilize the true breath—\nAnd immortality will remain unattained.\n\nFor this orifice precedes the Primordial and interfaces with the Post-Heavenly.\nThe two *Qi*s—Primordial and Post-Heavenly—\nTogether form the Chaos.\nFaint and obscure, yet within it lies essence;\nVague and indistinct, yet within it lies substance.\nNot ordinary substance, nor ordinary essence.\nHeaven obtains it to remain clear,\nEarth obtains it to remain tranquil,\nHumans obtain it to become spiritually alive.\n\nMaster Tan said:\n*\"Obtaining the gate of the boundless *Qi*—\nThus returning to the root;\nKnowing the sac of the Primordial Spirit—\nThus concealing its radiance.\nLike the pearl within the oyster,\nLike the gem within the stone—\nThis is the true meaning.\"*\n\nYet this orifice has no boundaries, no inside or outside.\nIf one seeks it through form, color, or appearance,\nOne will only err greatly.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Do not cling to non-action,\nNor fixate on form,\nNor dwell on visualization,\nNor obsess over maintenance.\"*\n\nThe sages modeled it in the *Dan Jing*.\nSome say it is *\"the high rise within the Mysterious\"*—\nLike a gourd, tightly sealed, where the spirit moves.\nOthers say it is *\"like a chicken’s egg\"*—\nBlack and white supporting each other,\nAn inch in breadth and length,\nThe beginning of all things,\nExpanding over ten months,\nBreaking free from its shell.\n\nStill others say it is *\"white as silk, connected like a ring\"*—\nAn inch and two tenths in breadth and length,\nEnclosing the essence of the entire body—\nThis clearly demonstrates the key to the Mysterious Pass,\nRevealing the mechanism of Transformation.\n\nScholars who fail to fathom its depth,\nWho do not grasp its subtlety,\nAt the time of practice,\nTake the gourd as the gourd,\nThe egg as the egg,\nThe ring as the ring—\nClinging to forms, fixating on illusions—\nHow could this not be a grave mistake?\n\nKnow that the Mysterious Pass, the gate of the Mysterious Mother,\nIs the foundation where immortals point to the workings of Transformation.\n\nYuè Chán said:\n*\"Seemingly present, yet not—\nWhere else but within oneself could it be settled?\"*\n\nYet its essence and function are inherently unified,\nLike *Qian* and *Kun* modeling Heaven and Earth,\n*Li* and *Kan* embodying the sun and moon.\n\n*The Classic of Harmony* says:\n*\"Where Chaos meets, the foundation is established.\"*\n\n「Cultivate and nourish the *Yīn* and *Yōu*—\nConcentrate the *shén* to form the vital frame.\n\nThen the *shén* and *qì* have their place,\nThe soul and spirit do not stray in chaos,\nThe returning light and radiant reflection find their way—\nEven in haste, they never leave the norm.\n\nIts verse:\nCultivate the *Yīn* and *Yōu* as the void,\nEnclose the Primordial Spirit within its form.\nInhaling and exhaling without pause,\nThe Whole Embryo perfected aligns with the Original Beginning.\n\nHere lies the full meaning of the Mysterious Mother.\n\nYet further discussion:\nThe *Yǎo Lín* text states:\n*\"One aperture, the Mysterious Pass—\nThe critical path of the Three Passes.\nSudden light movement, swift and unencumbered,\nThe Spirit-Water flows naturally.\"*\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"Below the heart, above the kidneys—\nWest of the liver, left of the lungs.\nNot the intestines, nor the stomach’s chamber,\nOne *qì* flows freely through.\"*\n\nNow I say:\nThe Mysterious Pass, the gate of the Mysterious Mother,\nLies at the center of one’s body—\nHeaven and Earth’s domain.\nTransformation and Creation inherently align here.\n\nI have examined its teachings,\nThough refined and clear,\nThey still lack the direct pointing of truth.\n\nHeaven does not hoard the Dao—\nIt spreads through the world.\nThe Most High’s compassionate mercy,\nNecessarily cannot be confined by strict adherence.\n\nI dare to purify and reveal the leaked Heavenly secrets,\nTo elucidate the Mysterious Pass’s core intent,\nBreaching the prohibition to share,\nSo that the body and essence may unite.\n\nAspiring cultivators of the Dao,\nUpon first reading, will grasp its profundity—\nMind and Spirit in accord,\nSeal it in practice, each word resonating.\n\nThis text is everywhere,\nGuarded by sacred essences.\nIf one’s karma is heavy and blessings meager,\nWith no affinity for the Dao,\nThey will encounter this secret yet doubt its truth.\nIt is but the scribblings of the blind,\nThe hollow sounds of the deaf.\n\nThe Mysterious is yet more Mysterious—\nHow could they ever comprehend it?\n\nThe secret speech declares:\n\nA finger’s breadth of substance,\nMingles the Three Realms.\nAbove the kidneys,\n[Situated] below the heart,\nVaguely within—\nThis is called the Mysterious Pass.\n\nOne must not guard it with deliberate intent,\nNor seek it without intent.\nIf one guards it with intent,\nOne will never attain it.\nIf one seeks it without intent,\nOne will find only its absence.\n\nHow then can one succeed?\nIt is when the will is undivided,\nThat the spirit congeals.\n\nOnly by stilling the heart and severing thoughts,\nAdjusting the breath to evenness,\nSilently ever-present,\nMust one not let it grow dim.\n\nWhen the qi is tranquil and harmonious,\nThe True Person enters *ding*,\nWithin this *ding*,\nObserving the inner landscape.\n\nAs soon as intention arises,\nThe sign begins to stir.\nOne perceives a breath,\nRising from the *gui*.\nMingled and continuous,\nStable yet surging—\nNurture it with sincerity,\nListen with the heart.\nThe Six Roots settled,\nFetal breathing congealed.\n\nNeither closed nor counted,\nLet it proceed naturally.\nAt utter stillness, a sigh—\nLike fish in spring marshes;\nAt extreme motion, a yawn—\nLike insects emerging from hibernation.\nYin and yang unfurling,\nIts wonders boundless.\n\nAfter some time,\nOne must forget the *qi* and merge with the spirit,\nReturning to the undifferentiated chaos,\nReaching the utmost emptiness,\nGuarding stillness with resolve—\nThe heart unmoved, no thoughts arising,\nNo coming, no going,\nNo entering, no exiting,\nSerene and ever-present.\n\nThis is called the True Person’s breath at its foundation.\n*Foundation* means its depth profound.\nSpirit and *qi* interacting—\nThis is the sign.\n\nWhat was spoken of earlier:\nThe origin of the Original *Qi*,\nThe rise of the True Breath.\nWhere intention reaches,\nCreation manifests;\nWhere the breath arises,\nThere lies the Mysterious Pass.\n\nNeither high nor low,\nNeither left nor right,\nNeither forward nor backward,\nNeither slanted nor balanced—\nA person’s body is the center of Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the true place.\n\nRefinement and union occur here;\nSmelting and bathing occur here;\nNurturing and gestation occur here;\nTranscendence and rebirth occur here—\nAll within this.\n\nIf not plainly revealed,\nStudents will only guess wildly,\nEither overreaching or falling short.\n\nZhongyang Zhuren said:\n*\"Even if your wisdom surpasses Yan Min,*\n*Without a clear teacher, no guessing suffices.*\n*For the alchemical canon lacks oral instructions,*\n*Leaving you nowhere to forge the spirit embryo.\"*\n\nYet this orifice—\nWhen *yang* expands and *yin* contracts,\nHas no fixed form.\nWhen intention arrives, it opens;\nOpening and closing have their time.\nIn a hundred days, the foundation is set,\nNurturing the *qi*-mother,\nThe empty chamber births white—\nThis appears naturally.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor’s three-month inner observation—\nThis is the same Dao.\n\nBelow the navel,\nBetween the intestines,\nCalled the *Tingdu* Gate, the Nine Abysses,\nWhere the *Nine Hells* preside—\n*Yin* filth accumulates,\nTrue *yang* does not dwell.\nThus, the Sacred Treasures’ methods of refinement and liberation,\nMeditating on this as the *Youguan*—\nHow could this be the path of cultivation?\nStudents must ponder this sincerely.\n\n**Alchemical Medicines**\nAn ancient song says:\n*\"Ask how this body of mine is formed—*\n*It does not depart from essence, *qi*, and spirit.*\n*Now I reveal the truth of birth:*\n*A single grain of primordial pearl—this is my kin.\"*\n\nSpirit and *qi*, essence—\nThe three supreme medicines.\nRefine essence into *qi*,\nRefine *qi* into spirit,\nRefine spirit into the Dao—\nThis is the key to the Seven Returns and Nine Reversions.\n\nRed lead, black mercury,\nWood fluid, gold essence,\nCinnabar, quicksilver,\nWhite gold, black tin,\nGolden male, yellow female,\n*Li* female, *Kan* male,\nAzure tortoise, vermilion serpent,\nFire dragon, water tiger,\nWhite snow, yellow shoots,\nJade pear, fire date,\nGolden rooster, jade hare,\n*Qian* horse, *Kun* ox,\nSun essence, moon dew,\nHeavenly soul, earthly shadow,\nRiver lead, gold furnace mercury,\nWater gold, fire wood,\n*Yin* within *yang*, *yang* within *yin*,\nBlack within white, male enfolding female—\nCountless names, all metaphors.\n\nThen what are these medicines?\nIt is said:\nThe essence of cultivation lies in the *Xuan Dan*,\nTo establish the *Xuan Dan*, first fortify the root.\nThe root’s foundation—\nThis is Original Essence.\nEssence is the transformation of Original *Qi*,\nThus essence and *qi* are one.\nWhen Original Spirit resides within,\nThe three converge as one.\n\nXinglin said:\n*\"All things born must die,*\n*Original Spirit dies yet lives again.*\n*When Spirit returns to the *qi* within,*\n*The alchemical Dao naturally succeeds.\"*\n\nShi Jianwu said:\n*\"Qi is the medicine that prolongs life,*\n*The heart directs the *qi* and Spirit.*\n*If one knows the master of *qi*-cultivation,*\n*Then one has attained the Dao of the Immortals.\"*\n\nIf essence is depleted, *qi* will fail,\nIf *qi* fails, Spirit will wander.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Essence returns to matter,*\n*Wandering Spirit becomes transformation.\"*\n\nTo restore the root—\nIs this not difficult?\n\nYuxi Zi said:\n*\"With the Original Essence’s unrefined Original *Qi*,\nAnd the most refined Spirit,\nThen Spirit shines with luminosity,*\n*Its transformations boundless—*\n*This is called Spirit.\"*\n\nAll speak of the medicines within the body,\nNot relying on external substances.\n\nYet the birth of medicines has its sources,\nGathering them has its seasons,\nPreparing them has its methods,\nAdministering them has its transformations,\nRefining them has its fire functions.\n\nI once heard from my teacher:\n*\"In the southwest lands,*\n*A place called Huangting—*\n*Vaguely, something exists,*\n*Dimly, a spirit lingers.*\n*Plainly, one medicine of water-gold,*\n*Seek it only in the Flower Pool.\"*\n\nThis is the source of the medicines.\n\nDrawn curtains seal *Dui*,\nSilencing the breath’s harmony,\nAbandoning form and wisdom,\nNear the state of *zuowang*.\nI urge you to remain all day like the foolish,\nRefining a single *ruyi*-pearl.\n\nThis is the season for gathering medicines.\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth,\nRootless spirit-herbs,\nWith single-minded intent,\nProducing the supreme treasure.\nThe Great Dao does not depart from the inch of land—\nCultivation’s work must be meticulous and steadfast.\n\nThis is the method of preparing medicines.\n\nHeart without heart,\nThought without thought,\nAttention focused within the *gui*,\nMerging into one *qi*.\n\nIt is also said:\n*\"Breath after breath, unbroken,*\n*Walking, sitting—transformations manifest.\"*\n\nThis is the transformation of administering medicines.\n\n「Refine the medicinal materials in stillness and quietude,\nConcentrate meticulously to form pills.\nWithin the twelve hours,\nSilence all thought and boil with the *fire of Dao*.\n\nKeep the golden cauldron’s broth ever warm,\nNever let the jade furnace’s flame grow cold.\nThis is the Dao/Way of refining medicinal *fire*.\n\nEssentially, the *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) is the origin of yin and yang,\nThe dwelling of spirit and *qi*.\nSpirit and *qi* are the elixir of nature and life,\nThe root of prenatal breathing (*taixi* 胎息),\nThe progenitor of inhalation and exhalation,\nThe path of deep-rooted and firm establishment.\n\nThe womb is the repository of the spirit,\nBreath is the primordial element for transforming the womb.\nThe womb depends on breath to form,\nBreath depends on the womb to sustain.\nWithout breath, the womb cannot manifest,\nWithout the womb, the spirit has no master.\n\nBefore a person is born,\nVast and formless as the boundless void,\nWhen parents unite in essence,\nThe first signs appear—\nA single point begins to congeal,\nPurely the essence of nature and life.\nFor three months in chaotic unity,\nThe *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) stands firm.\n\nOnce the *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) is established,\nIt clings like a melon’s stem.\nThe infant in the womb,\nSilently draws upon the mother’s *qi*.\nWhen the mother inhales, the child inhales,\nWhen the mother exhales, the child exhales—\nAll movements, inner and outer,\nRespond in harmony.\nNo perception, no cognition,\nNo clarity, no awareness.\nThe *qi* of Heaven is vast and boundless,\nThe *qi* of Earth is deep and obscure,\nYet one breath remains.\n\nAt the appointed time, birth occurs—\nHeaven and Earth reverse,\nThe person is startled as the fetal sac breaks,\nLike one who stumbles atop the Great Mountain’s peak,\nHead dangling, feet propped,\nEmerging with a great cry—\nThe breath is then forgotten,\nAnd thus cannot be retained in full.\n\nMoreover, disturbances agitate the mind,\nCleverness dazzles the eyes,\nAffection leads the emotions,\nDesire corrupts the nature—\nAll these scatter the original purity,\nDissolving it into myriad things.\n\nOnce the womb’s single breath is lost,\nIt can never be guarded again.\n\nThe Dao/Way of immortals teaches refining essence,\nTo return to the origin,\nRestore the beginning,\nRegenerate the five *zang* organs,\nReform the physical body—\nFrom formlessness to form,\nCongealing into a sacred womb.\n\nIts secret is:\n*\"Can you concentrate *qi* to such softness,\nAs to resemble an infant?\"*\n*\"Abandon all thoughts and stop all distractions,\nGuard the One with a tranquil heart—\nExternal thoughts do not enter,\nInternal thoughts do not escape,\nAll day in chaotic unity,\nAs if still in the mother’s womb.\"*\n\nWhen the spirit is settled,\nIt gathers with the *qi*.\nWhen the *qi* is harmonized,\nIt merges with the spirit.\nThe spirit congeals into *qi*,\nThe *qi* sustains as spirit.\n\nIn the realm of still repose,\nVaguely, in the land of *wuheyou* (无何有),\nHeaven’s heart is obscure,\nFocusing on a single orifice—\nLike a hen brooding an egg,\nOr a fish in water,\nExhaling to the root,\nInhaling to the stem—\nContinuous as if ever-present,\nAgain guarding the womb’s single breath.\n\nGuard nothing, yet the true breath abides,\nVanished as if nonexistent,\nThough the heart is within the heart,\nNo trace remains to cling to.\nIn the boundless void,\nOnly the boundless spirit is sovereign over transformation.\nWhen the time arrives,\nThe subtle principles reveal themselves—\nLightly, effortlessly, they move,\nSilently, naturally, they arise.\nWith subtle intent, stabilize the *qi*,\nResponding to the pivot of transformation—\nThen metal and wood blend naturally,\nWater and fire ascend and descend in harmony.\nSuddenly, a single point grows large as a millet seed,\nFalling into the Yellow Court (黄庭).\n\nThis is the moment for gathering *lead-mercury* (铅汞),\nForming one day’s elixir within one day’s cycle.\nThe *Fuhe Pian* (复合篇) says:\n*\"At night, chaotic unity collapses to the earth,\nTen thousand phenomena rise in orderly array, yet all are unknown.\"*\n\nAt this time,\nThe body is in perfect unity with the void,\nUnknown whether spirit is *qi*,\nUnknown whether *qi* is spirit—\nSuch is the transformation’s Dao,\nNot one of deliberate cultivation.\n\nThese are all the Dao/Way’s natural principles,\nI too do not know how they are so.\nOnce the medicine is born,\nThe *fire* emerges naturally.\nEssentially, the medicine’s birth—\nSmall, it can harmonize with the *Kan Li* (坎离) transformations,\nGreat, it can align with the *Qian Kun* (乾坤) movements.\nThe intent of the *Golden Elixir* (金丹)\nIs fully revealed here.\nHow could lesser methods compare?\n\nIf you do not trust me,\nAbandon *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) and seek external foundations,\nPursue external spirit and *qi* while searching for medicinal substances—\nUnaware of the natural womb and breath,\nYet recklessly applying the *fire*’s stages,\nDiscarding the root for the branches,\nChasing illusions while lost in truth,\nHeaven will strip your control—\nI have no way to help you.\n\nThe ancient song on *fire*’s stages says:\n*\"The Sage transmits medicine, not fire,\nFrom ancient times, few know the stages of fire.\"*\n\nWhat does \"not transmit\" mean?\nIt is not that the fire is kept secret.\nFor when gathering medicines, it is called *medicine*,\nYet within the medicine lies the *fire*.\nWhen refining, it is called *fire*,\nYet within the fire lies the *medicine*.\nIf one knows the medicine and takes the *fire*,\nThe elixir will naturally form—\nThere are those who need not be taught to know.\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"Medicinal substances contain yin within yang,\nThe stages of fire contain yang within yin.\nMastering yin and yang’s intent,\nThen the stages of fire become clear in one place.\"*\nThis is its profound meaning.\n\nLater generations, confused by alchemical texts,\nCannot instantly awaken—\nHearing of *twenty-four breaths* (二十四炁),\n*seventy-two stages* (七十二候),\n*twenty-eight constellations* (二十八宿),\n*sixty-four hexagrams* (六十四卦),\n*twelve divisions of heavenly influence* (十二分野),\n*day-moon conjunction* (日月合璧),\n*tide-like rising and falling* (海潮升降),\n*eternal life’s three mysteries* (长生三昧),\n*yang texts and yin strategies* (阳文阴武)—\nThey must investigate which is *fire*,\nWhich is the *stage*.\nExhausting their minds in a lifetime,\nThey cling to endless appearances—\nThough they grasp the true medicinal substances,\nThey hesitate, not daring to refine them.\n\nLittle do they know:\nThe true *fire* has no stages,\nThe supreme medicine requires no measure.\n\nThe *Yue Chan* (玉蟾) says:\n*\"Fire originates from the southern *Li* (离) hexagram,\nBelonging to the heart.\nThe heart is the spirit,\nThe spirit is the fire,\nThe *qi* is the medicine.\nTo refine medicine with fire into elixir\nIs to govern *qi* with spirit to attain the Dao.\"*\nIts teachings are so clear,\nSo direct and unobstructed.\nThose lacking innate immortal constitution\nMock it as empty words,\nPassing it by in plain sight—\nDeeply lamentable.\n\nYet the essence of the *fire*’s stages’ incantation\nMust be sought within the true breath.\n\nFor breath arises from the heart,\nWhen the heart is tranquil, the breath is harmonized,\nEach breath returns to its root—\nThe mother of the *Golden Elixir*.\n\nThe *Xin Yin Jing* (心印经) says:\n*\"The returning wind unites in harmony,\nIts efficacy is revealed in a hundred days’ cultivation—\nThis is the true breath.\"*\n\n「The *Rù Yào Jìng* (《入药镜》) states:\n*\"To awaken the *Xùn* (巽) wind,\nTo circulate the *Kūn* (坤) fire,\nTo enter the *Yellow Chamber* (黄房),\nAnd forge the *Supreme Treasure* (至宝)—\nThis is the way.\"*\n\nThe *Hǎi Chán Wēng* (海蟾翁) speaks of:\n*\"Opening and closing the *Tiān Kūn* (乾坤) power of creation,\nSmelting a furnace of true *Rén* (真) sun and moon—\nThis is the way.\"*\n\nWhat does it mean by *\"the True Person* (真人) *plunges into the deep abyss,\nAnd drifts in the *Guī* (规) without straying\"*?\n\nIt is necessary to govern *qi* (炁) with spirit (神),\nTo steady *qi* (炁) with breath (息),\nAs the *Tuó Ruò* (橐钥) opens and closes,\nAnd as *Yīn* (阴) and *Yáng* (阳) ascend and descend—\nInhaling and exhaling, let it be natural.\n\nFocus *qi* (炁) to attain softness (柔),\nRetain the light in silent stillness (含光默默),\nIn all actions—moving, resting, sitting, lying—\nContinuously nurture as though it were ever-present.\n\nLike a woman carrying a child,\nLike a small dragon nurturing its pearl.\nGradually refining, gradually smelting,\nGradually condensing, gradually forming—\nWhen the practice is pure and complete,\nIt merges into one.\n\nBetween motion and stillness,\nIt is more fitting to *xiāo-xī* (消息).\n\nDo not let thoughts arise,\nFor thoughts arise, and the fire will flare.\nDo not let the mind stray,\nFor the mind strays, and the fire will chill.\nOnly ensure it neither exceeds nor falls short,\nBalancing the holding and releasing with moderation—\nSpirit embracing *qi* (炁),\n*Qi* (炁) embracing spirit,\nWith singular intent, blending harmoniously,\nEnveloping the *Hún Dùn* (混沌).\n\nThis is called *\"the continuity of the fire-seed* (火种),\nAnd the *Dan Dǐng* (丹鼎) ever-warm—\nNo moment of interruption,\nNo slightest deviation.\nTo refine in such a manner for an instant,\nIs a full *Zhōu Tiān* (周天) of that instant.\nTo refine in such a manner for a time,\nIs a full *Zhōu Tiān* (周天) of that time.\nTo refine in such a manner for a day,\nIs a full *Zhōu Tiān* (周天) of that day.\nRefining for a hundred days is called *establishing the foundation* (立基).\nRefining for ten months is called *the embryonic immortal* (胎仙).\nUntil the *Yuán Hǎi* (元海) gives birth to *Yáng* (阳),\nAnd fire arises within water—\nThe cycles of heaven and earth revolve,\nThe *Tiān Kūn* (天乾) alternate,\nYet all remain within a single breath.\n\nHow much more so when it comes to *mù yù* (沐浴) and *wēn yǎng* (温养),\nAdvancing and withdrawing, extracting and adding—\nWithin these lies the profound alignment with *heavenly mechanism* (天机),\nThe subtle correspondence with creation’s design,\nYet it does not rely on our own strength.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Though fire has its stages,\nNo need for contrived manipulations.\"*\n\nI know not of the *Wùzhǔ* (子午) *method*,\nNor of the *huì-míng* (晦明) *phases* or *shéng-zuò* (弦朔) *nodes*,\nNor of the divisions between *winter solstice* (冬至) and *summer solstice* (夏至),\nNor of the distinctions between *Yīn* (阴) fire and *Yáng* (阳) symbols,\nNor of the claim that within twelve hours, only one hour suffices,\nNor of the secret that within three hundred days, only half a day is needed,\nNor of the notion that years, months, days, and hours must be amassed.\nIf one speaks of timing,\nThen all twelve *shēn* (辰) moments are as the mind directs.\nIf one speaks of its marvel,\nThen an instant’s practice holds a year’s stages.\n\nOnly let the spirit rest in natural ease—\nThis is the *master’s* (先师) true teaching.\nDay and night, the *Lún* (屯) and *Méng* (蒙) unfold naturally—\nWhy tirelessly observe the fire’s stages?\nThis is the *master’s* (先师) definitive principle.\n\nAh! The *sages’* (圣人) intent—\nTo transmit the *medicine* (药) but not the *fire* (火)—\nIs fully revealed here.\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"The seeker needs no laborious teacher,\nFor this book alone reveals the Dao’s mystery.\nThough iron shoes may be worn to dust in search,\nThe treasure comes with effortless ease.\"*\n\nPostscript.\n\nThe spirit has no fixed form, the *Dao* no fixed shape.\nWhat is called the *play of the Mystic Pass*—\nmerely a method to\n**let the spirit guide the *qi* and the *qi* return to the spirit,**\n**to turn the light inward and gather the wandering thoughts.**\n\nMaster Yùxī said:\n*\"To take uprightness and sincerity as the central pillar—*\nthis is the way.\"\n\nWhat is called *medicine* and *fire’s stages*\nare but metaphors.\n\nFor the essence of the Great *Dao* lies beyond\nall contrivance of mind, knowledge, or intent.\n\nBut know this:\nWithin the body, there is a sovereign of creation—\nand *Dao* is simply what is *mine* in this moment.\n\nIf one knows this,\ntaking stillness as foundation and clarity as base,\nthen in an instant’s turn, the *heavenly mechanism* moves of its own accord—\n**without deliberate regulation, yet regulation is complete;**\n**without forced breath-retention, yet breath-retention is natural;**\n**medicine is not sought, yet it arises;**\n**fire is not summoned, yet it emerges—**\nall are the marvelous workings of nature.\n\nHow could it depend on\n**fixing the mind, straining the body,**\n**letting knowledge or intent labor for the *Dao*?**\n\nWhen one arrives at this ultimate truth,\nwords may be forgotten.\n\nWhat say the clear-eyed?\n\n**Wu Yi’s Ascended True Transformation in the Mystic Cavern of Transcendent Change,**\n**by the True-Placed Daoist, the Empty-White Child, Chen Chongsu, prefaces.**\n**Chen Xu Bai’s *Zhongzhong* (规中) *Compass of the Center*, Volume Two.**",

embryo.\n\nThe ancients called it:\n*The蒂 of the Supreme Ultimate, the handle of the Primordial, the root of the Void, the origin of Chaos, the Valley of the Great Emptiness, the source of

the two kidneys,\nNor the point one inch below the navel,\nNor the Clear Hall or the Mud Pillow,\nNor the Gate of Life or the Sea of Vitality.\n\nThen where is it?\nMy secret technique is called **\"the Center of the Rule\"**—\nWith single-minded focus, the embryo-immortal is formed.\n\n*The Classic of Harmony* says:\n*\"The True Person hides in the deep abyss,\nFloating and guarding the Center of the Rule.\"*\nThis is its location.\n\n*Laozi* says:\n*\"Much speech leads to exhaustion—\nBetter to guard the Center.\"*\n\nIt lies beneath *Qian*, above *Kun*,\nWest of *Zhen*, east of *Dui*—\nThe realm where *Kan* and *Li* (water and fire) copulate.\n\nA human body is the very center of Heaven and Earth.\nEight vessels and nine orifices, veins and meridians converge here—\nA vacant orifice, suspended like a millet grain,\nNeither form nor substance, yet born of the Dao itself.\nSeemingly present, yet absent;\nSeemingly lost, yet existing—\nNeither inside nor outside,\nYet containing *Qian* and *Kun* within.\nThe Yellow Center harmonizes with principle,\nResiding in its proper position.\n\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*\"Only the pure and singular—\nFirmly grasp the Center.\"*\n\n*The Scripture of Guiding Others* says:\n*\"The Center harmonizes the Five *Qi*,\nMerging with the Hundred Spirits.\"*\n\nMaster Cui called it *\"Piercing the Tailbone, Communing with the Mud Pillow.\"*\nPure Yang named it *\"The Origin of Life’s Breath, the First Reception of Qi.\"*\n\nMaster Ping said:\n*\"I urge you to seek the origin of life’s breath.\"*\n\nThis is where the Primordial *Qi* arises,\nWhere the true breath originates.\nThus, Yuè Chán also called it *\"The place where the mind moves.\"*\n\nThose who cultivate the Elixir, if they fail to understand this orifice,\nWill not stabilize the true breath—\nAnd immortality will remain unattained.\n\nFor this orifice precedes the Primordial and interfaces with the Post-Heavenly.\nThe two *Qi*s—Primordial and Post-Heavenly—\nTogether form the Chaos.\nFaint and obscure, yet within it lies essence;\nVague and indistinct, yet within it lies substance.\nNot ordinary substance, nor ordinary essence.\nHeaven obtains it to remain clear,\nEarth obtains it to remain tranquil,\nHumans obtain it to become spiritually alive.\n\nMaster Tan said:\n*\"Obtaining the gate of the boundless *Qi*—\nThus returning to the root;\nKnowing the sac of the Primordial Spirit—\nThus concealing its radiance.\nLike the pearl within the oyster,\nLike the gem within the stone—\nThis is the true meaning.\"*\n\nYet this orifice has no boundaries, no inside or outside.\nIf one seeks it through form, color, or appearance,\nOne will only err greatly.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Do not cling to non-action,\nNor fixate on form,\nNor dwell on visualization,\nNor obsess over maintenance.\"*\n\nThe sages modeled it in the *Dan Jing*.\nSome say it is *\"the high rise within the Mysterious\"*—\nLike a gourd, tightly sealed, where the spirit moves.\nOthers say it is *\"like a chicken’s egg\"*—\nBlack and white supporting each other,\nAn inch in breadth and length,\nThe beginning of all things,\nExpanding over ten months,\nBreaking free from its shell.\n\nStill others say it is *\"white as silk, connected like a ring\"*—\nAn inch and two tenths in breadth and length,\nEnclosing the essence of the entire body—\nThis clearly demonstrates the key to the Mysterious Pass,\nRevealing the mechanism of Transformation.\n\nScholars who fail to fathom its depth,\nWho do not grasp its subtlety,\nAt the time of practice,\nTake the gourd as the gourd,\nThe egg as the egg,\nThe ring as the ring—\nClinging to forms, fixating on illusions—\nHow could this not be a grave mistake?\n\nKnow that the Mysterious Pass, the gate of the Mysterious Mother,\nIs the foundation where immortals point to the workings of Transformation.\n\nYuè Chán said:\n*\"Seemingly present, yet not—\nWhere else but within oneself could it be settled?\"*\n\nYet its essence and function are inherently unified,\nLike *Qian* and *Kun* modeling Heaven and Earth,\n*Li* and *Kan* embodying the sun and moon.\n\n*The Classic of Harmony*

the Mysterious Pass.\n\nOne must not guard it with deliberate intent,\nNor seek it without intent.\nIf one guards it with intent,\nOne will never attain it.\nIf one seeks it without intent,\nOne will find only its absence.\n\nHow then can one succeed?\nIt is when the will is undivided,\nThat the spirit congeals.\n\nOnly by stilling the heart and severing thoughts,\nAdjusting the breath to evenness,\nSilently ever-present,\nMust one not let it grow dim.\n\nWhen the qi is tranquil and harmonious,\nThe True Person enters *ding*,\nWithin this *ding*,\nObserving the inner landscape.\n\nAs soon as intention arises,\nThe sign begins to stir.\nOne perceives a breath,\nRising from the *gui*.\nMingled and continuous,\nStable yet surging—\nNurture it with sincerity,\nListen with the heart.\nThe Six Roots settled,\nFetal breathing congealed.\n\nNeither closed nor counted,\nLet it proceed naturally.\nAt utter stillness, a sigh—\nLike fish in spring marshes;\nAt extreme motion, a yawn—\nLike insects emerging from hibernation.\nYin and yang unfurling,\nIts wonders boundless.\n\nAfter some time,\nOne must forget the *qi* and merge with the spirit,\nReturning to the undifferentiated chaos,\nReaching the utmost emptiness,\nGuarding stillness with resolve—\nThe heart unmoved, no thoughts arising,\nNo coming, no going,\nNo entering, no exiting,\nSerene and ever-present.\n\nThis is called the True Person’s breath at its foundation.\n*Foundation* means its depth profound.\nSpirit and *qi* interacting—\nThis is the sign.\n\nWhat was spoken of earlier:\nThe origin of the Original *Qi*,\nThe rise of the True Breath.\nWhere intention reaches,\nCreation manifests;\nWhere the breath arises,\nThere lies the Mysterious Pass.\n\nNeither high nor low,\nNeither left nor right,\nNeither forward nor backward,\nNeither slanted nor balanced—\nA person’s body is the center of Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the true place.\n\nRefinement and union occur here;\nSmelting and bathing occur here;\nNurturing and gestation occur here;\nTranscendence and rebirth occur here—\nAll within this.\n\nIf not plainly revealed,\nStudents will only guess wildly,\nEither overreaching or falling short.\n\nZhongyang Zhuren said:\n*\"Even if your wisdom surpasses Yan Min,*\n*Without a clear teacher, no guessing suffices.*\n*For the alchemical canon lacks oral instructions,*\n*Leaving you nowhere to forge the spirit embryo.\"*\n\nYet this orifice—\nWhen *yang* expands and *yin* contracts,\nHas no fixed form.\nWhen intention arrives, it opens;\nOpening and closing have their time.\nIn a hundred days, the foundation is set,\nNurturing the *qi*-mother,\nThe empty chamber births white—\nThis appears naturally.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor’s three-month inner observation—\nThis is the same Dao.\n\nBelow the navel,\nBetween the intestines,\nCalled the *Tingdu* Gate, the Nine Abysses,\nWhere the *Nine Hells* preside—\n*Yin* filth accumulates,\nTrue *yang* does not dwell.\nThus, the Sacred Treasures’ methods of refinement and liberation,\nMeditating on this as the *Youguan*—\nHow could this be the path of cultivation?\nStudents must ponder this sincerely.\n\n**Alchemical Medicines**\nAn ancient song says:\n*\"Ask how this body of mine is formed—*\n*It does not depart from essence, *qi*, and spirit.*\n*Now I reveal the truth of birth:*\n*A single grain of primordial pearl—this is my kin.\"*\n\nSpirit and *qi*, essence—\nThe three supreme medicines.\nRefine essence into *qi*,\nRefine *qi* into spirit,\nRefine spirit into the Dao—\nThis

dew,\nHeavenly soul, earthly shadow,\nRiver lead, gold furnace mercury,\nWater gold, fire wood,\n*Yin* within *yang*, *yang* within *yin*,\nBlack within white, male enfolding female—\nCountless names, all metaphors.\n\nThen what are these medicines?\nIt is said:\nThe essence of cultivation lies in the *Xuan Dan*,\nTo establish the *Xuan Dan*, first fortify the root.\nThe root’s foundation—\nThis is Original Essence.\nEssence is the transformation of Original *Qi*,\nThus essence and *qi* are one.\nWhen Original Spirit resides within,\nThe three converge as one.\n\nXinglin said:\n*\"All things born must die,*\n*Original Spirit dies yet lives again.*\n*When Spirit returns to the *qi* within,*\n*The alchemical Dao naturally succeeds.\"*\n\nShi Jianwu said:\n*\"Qi is the medicine that prolongs life,*\n*The heart directs the *qi* and Spirit.*\n*If one knows the master of *qi*-cultivation,*\n*Then one has attained the Dao of the Immortals.\"*\n\nIf essence is depleted, *qi* will fail,\nIf *qi* fails, Spirit will wander.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Essence returns to matter,*\n*Wandering Spirit becomes transformation.\"*\n\nTo restore the root—\nIs this not difficult?\n\nYuxi Zi

speak of the medicines within the body,\nNot relying on external substances.\n\nYet the birth of medicines has its sources,\nGathering them has its seasons,\nPreparing them has its methods,\nAdministering them has its transformations,\nRefining them has its fire functions.\n\nI once heard from my teacher:\n*\"In the southwest lands,*\n*A place called Huangting—*\n*Vaguely, something exists,*\n*Dimly, a spirit lingers.*\n*Plainly, one medicine of water-gold,*\n*Seek it only in the Flower Pool.\"*\n\nThis is the source of the medicines.\n\nDrawn curtains seal *Dui*,\nSilencing the breath’s harmony,\nAbandoning form and wisdom,\nNear the state of *zuowang*.\nI urge you to remain all day like the foolish,\nRefining a single *ruyi*-pearl.\n\nThis is the season for gathering medicines.\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth,\nRootless spirit-herbs,\nWith single-minded intent,\nProducing the supreme treasure.\nThe Great Dao does not depart from the inch of land—\nCultivation’s work must be meticulous and steadfast.\n\nThis is the method of preparing medicines.\n\nHeart without heart,\nThought without thought,\nAttention focused within the *gui*,\nMerging into one *qi*.\n\nIt is also said:\n*\"Breath after breath, unbroken,*\n*Walking, sitting—transformations manifest.\"*\n\nThis is the transformation of administering medicines.",

      "translated_text": "「Refine the medicinal materials in stillness and quietude,\nConcentrate meticulously to form pills.\nWithin the twelve hours,\nSilence all thought and boil with the *fire of Dao*.\n\nKeep the golden cauldron’s broth ever warm,\nNever let the jade furnace’s flame grow cold.\nThis is the Dao/Way of refining medicinal *fire*.\n\nEssentially, the *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) is the origin of yin and yang,\nThe dwelling of spirit and *qi*.\nSpirit and *qi* are the elixir of nature and life,\nThe root of prenatal breathing (*taixi* 胎息),\nThe progenitor of inhalation and exhalation,\nThe path of deep-rooted and firm establishment.\n\nThe womb is the repository of the spirit,\nBreath is the primordial element for transforming the womb.\nThe womb depends on breath to form,\nBreath depends on the womb to sustain.\nWithout breath, the womb cannot manifest,\nWithout the womb, the spirit has no master.\n\nBefore a person is born,\nVast and formless as the boundless void,\nWhen parents unite in essence,\nThe first signs appear—\nA single point begins to congeal,\nPurely the essence of nature and life.\nFor three months in chaotic unity,\nThe *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) stands firm.\n\nOnce the *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) is established,\nIt clings like a melon’s stem.\nThe infant in the womb,\nSilently draws upon the mother’s *qi*.\nWhen the mother inhales, the child inhales,\nWhen the mother exhales, the child exhales—\nAll movements, inner and outer,\nRespond in harmony.\nNo perception, no cognition,\nNo clarity, no awareness.\nThe *qi* of Heaven is vast and boundless,\nThe *qi* of Earth is deep and obscure,\nYet one breath remains.\n\nAt the appointed time, birth occurs—\nHeaven and Earth reverse,\nThe person is startled as the fetal sac breaks,\nLike one who stumbles atop the Great Mountain’s peak,\nHead dangling, feet propped,\nEmerging with a great cry—\nThe breath is then forgotten,\nAnd thus cannot be retained in full.\n\nMoreover, disturbances agitate the mind,\nCleverness dazzles the eyes,\nAffection leads the emotions,\nDesire corrupts the nature—\nAll these scatter the original purity,\nDissolving it into myriad things.\n\nOnce the womb’s single breath is lost,\nIt can never be guarded again.\n\nThe Dao/Way of immortals teaches refining essence,\nTo return to the origin,\nRestore the beginning,\nRegenerate the five *zang* organs,\nReform the physical body—\nFrom formlessness to form,\nCongealing into a sacred womb.\n\nIts secret is:\n*\"Can you concentrate *qi* to such softness,\nAs to resemble an infant?\"*\n*\"Abandon all thoughts and stop all distractions,\nGuard the One with a tranquil heart—\nExternal thoughts do not enter,\nInternal thoughts do not escape,\nAll day in chaotic unity,\nAs if still in the mother’s womb.\"*\n\nWhen the spirit is settled,\nIt gathers with the *qi*.\nWhen the *qi* is harmonized,\nIt merges with the spirit.\nThe spirit congeals into *qi*,\nThe *qi* sustains as spirit.\n\nIn the realm of still repose,\nVaguely, in the land of *wuheyou* (无何有),\nHeaven’s heart is obscure,\nFocusing on a single orifice—\nLike a hen brooding an egg,\nOr a fish in water,\nExhaling to the root,\nInhaling to the stem—\nContinuous as if ever-present,\nAgain guarding the womb’s single breath.\n\nGuard nothing, yet the true breath abides,\nVanished as if nonexistent,\nThough the heart is within the heart,\nNo trace remains to cling to.\nIn the boundless void,\nOnly the boundless spirit is sovereign over transformation.\nWhen the time arrives,\nThe subtle principles reveal themselves—\nLightly, effortlessly, they move,\nSilently, naturally, they arise.\nWith subtle intent, stabilize the *qi*,\nResponding to the pivot of transformation—\nThen metal and wood blend naturally,\nWater and fire ascend and descend in harmony.\nSuddenly, a single point grows large as a millet seed,\nFalling into the Yellow Court (黄庭).\n\nThis is the moment for gathering *lead-mercury* (铅汞),\nForming one day’s elixir within one day’s cycle.\nThe *Fuhe Pian* (复合篇) says:\n*\"At night, chaotic unity collapses to the earth,\nTen thousand phenomena rise in orderly array, yet all are unknown.\"*\n\nAt this time,\nThe body is in perfect unity with the void,\nUnknown whether spirit is *qi*,\nUnknown whether *qi* is spirit—\nSuch is the transformation’s Dao,\nNot one of deliberate cultivation.\n\nThese are all the Dao/Way’s natural principles,\nI too do not know how they are so.\nOnce the medicine is born,\nThe *fire* emerges naturally.\nEssentially, the medicine’s birth—\nSmall, it can harmonize with the *Kan Li* (坎离) transformations,\nGreat, it can align with the *Qian Kun* (乾坤) movements.\nThe intent of the *Golden Elixir* (金丹)\nIs fully revealed here.\nHow could lesser methods compare?\n\nIf you do not trust me,\nAbandon *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) and seek external foundations,\nPursue external spirit and *qi* while searching for medicinal substances—\nUnaware of the natural womb and breath,\nYet recklessly applying the *fire*’s stages,\nDiscarding the root for the branches,\nChasing illusions while lost in truth,\nHeaven will strip your control—\nI have no way to help you.\n\nThe ancient song on *fire*’s stages says:\n*\"The Sage transmits medicine, not fire,\nFrom ancient times, few know the stages of fire.\"*\n\nWhat does \"not transmit\" mean?\nIt is not that the fire is kept secret.\nFor when gathering medicines, it is called *medicine*,\nYet within the medicine lies the *fire*.\nWhen refining, it is called *fire*,\nYet within the fire lies the *medicine*.\nIf one knows the medicine and takes the *fire*,\nThe elixir will naturally form—\nThere are those who need not be taught to know.\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"Medicinal substances contain yin within yang,\nThe stages of fire contain yang within yin.\nMastering yin and yang’s intent,\nThen the stages of fire become clear in one place.\"*\nThis is its profound meaning.\n\nLater generations, confused by alchemical texts,\nCannot instantly awaken—\nHearing of *twenty-four breaths* (二十四炁),\n*seventy-two stages* (七十二候),\n*twenty-eight constellations* (二十八宿),\n*sixty-four hexagrams* (六十四卦),\n*twelve divisions of

investigate which is *fire*,\nWhich is the *stage*.\nExhausting their minds in a lifetime,\nThey cling to endless appearances—\nThough they grasp the true medicinal substances,\nThey hesitate, not daring to refine them.\n\nLittle do they know:\nThe true *fire* has no stages,\nThe supreme medicine requires no measure.\n\nThe *Yue Chan* (玉蟾) says:\n*\"Fire originates from the southern *Li* (离) hexagram,\nBelonging to the heart.\nThe heart is the spirit,\nThe spirit is the fire,\nThe *qi* is the medicine.\nTo refine medicine with fire into elixir\nIs to govern *qi* with spirit to attain the Dao.\"*\nIts teachings are so clear,\nSo direct and unobstructed.\nThose lacking innate immortal constitution\nMock it as empty words,\nPassing it by in plain sight—\nDeeply lamentable.\n\nYet the essence of the *fire*’s stages’ incantation\nMust be sought within the true breath.\n\nFor breath arises from the heart,\nWhen the heart is tranquil, the breath is harmonized,\nEach breath returns to its root—\nThe mother of the *Golden Elixir*.\n\nThe *Xin Yin Jing* (心印经) says:\n*\"The returning wind unites in harmony,\nIts efficacy is revealed in a hundred days’ cultivation—\nThis is the true
